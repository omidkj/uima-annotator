Chief Complaint:
Left retroperitoneal sarcoma.


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Thoracoabdominal resection of left retroperitoneal sarcoma.


History of Present Illness:
This was a 40-year-old man who had initially presented to an
outside hospital for an apparent hyperglycemic hyperosmolar
syndrome in mid [**2177-7-2**].  At that time he described a several
month history of left flank discomfort and nausea with a
10-pound weight loss and daily fever.  Cross-sectional imaging
revealed an extremely large approximately 16-cm retroperitoneal
mass involving the inferior aspect of the left kidney and
contiguous with the inferior psoas muscle.  A core needle biopsy
had been performed showing a spindle cell tumor with a high
mitotic rate.  However, no immunohistochemistry was provided.
Therefore he underwent a repeated core needle biopsy under image
guidance by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 519**] on [**2177-8-21**].  After a complete
immunohistochemical analysis, the patient was now thought
consistent with a pleomorphic myogenic sarcoma which was
high-grade. As the patient was being prepared for surgery, he
had a brief admission at an outside hospital in mid [**Month (only) 216**] for
an episode of aggravated pain and fever.  He subsequently
underwent a repeat CT scan which suggested that the mass was
largely unchanged but potentially increased somewhat in size.
His hematocrit had remained stable at approximately 29 to 30.
Preoperative radiotherapy was considered but in light of the
patient's extreme symptoms and what appeared to be a rapidly
deteriorating clinical status, it was felt to proceed with a
ressection at this time which the patient freely consented to
procedure.

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 40 year old male with history of left retroperitoneal
mass who is status post resection of left retroperitoneal mass
complicated by bleeding. The reader is referred to the operative
note for details.  The patient was intubated on pressors and
sedation and postoperatively transferred to the intensive care
unit. The patient underwent aggressive fluid volume
resuscitation and required several blood transfusions. The
patient stayed in the intensive care unit for 1 day and
stabilized. Subsequently the pressors were weaned and the
patient was extubated successfully.  Of note the hematocrit was
stable and there were no further signs of hypovolemia. The
patient was subsequently transferred to the inpatient general
surgery unit in stable condition.

The patient was kept with nothing by mouth, with IV hydration
and a Dilaudid PCA for pain control. The urine output was
monitored closely with a foley catheter in place.
On postoperative day 2 was started on sips. The blood glucose
were monitored closely and he received insulin appropriately.
The patient had flatus and return of bowel function on
postoperative day 3 and was started on clear liquids and had no
nausea or emesis.On postoperative day 4 the diet was advanced to
regular which was tolerated well. The PCA was subsequently
discontinued and oral pain medications were initiated. The
patient had adequate urine output and foley catheter was
discontinued and he voided without difficulty. A renal
ultrasound was obtained to assess
for any potential hydronephrosis indicative of potential
ischemic injury to the ureter. The findings showed free fluid
around left kidney but no hydronephrosis.

On postoperative day 5, reported pain ineffective pain control
on oral Oxycodone and ibuprofen was added to pain regimen with
good effect. The patient was also maintained on a bowel regimen
Senna and Colace. Of note reported no bowel movement but
continued to pass flatus and there was no concern for a
postoperative ileus. The patient continued to progress well and
at time of discharge, had adequate pain control, was afebrile,
vital signs were stable,was tolerating a regular diet,
ambulating and voiding without assistance.The transverse
abdominal incision with staples was intact without any erythema
or ecchymosis. The staples will be removed at his postoperative
visit next week. The patient received discharge teaching a
follow-up instructions with understanding verbalized and
