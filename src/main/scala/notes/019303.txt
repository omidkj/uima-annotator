Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5129**]
Chief Complaint:
59F h/o presents with SOB.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
HPI: 59F h/o ESRD on HD [**2-21**] IgA nephropathy s/p failed cadaveric
transplant, malignant HTN complicated by seizures, diastolic
CHF, Afib, h/o medical non-complaince presents with SOB.
.
The patient receives HD 3x per week, last session was Saturday.
Sunday she felt more fatigued in the AM, but was able to work
12-6pm and perform physical labor. Ate dinner of fried fish
around 8pm and took all of her medications (reports no lapses
recently). At 10pm, she went to bed and noted a 'gurgling'
sensation in her chest/throat with fluid 'dripping from her
mouth' that she has had before with CHF exacerbations. While she
usually only uses 1 pillow at night, she had to sit nearly
upright to fall asleep. She awoke 1 hour later with SOB acutely
and called 911. Denies associated CP or nausea, but did feel
diaphoretic. No recent PND or peripheral edema. Of note, her BP
regimen was recently simplified [**9-28**] from 4 agents to only
toprol XL and diltiazem ER, and she wonders if her BP is being
effectively controlled.

In the ED, afebrile, 200/100, 90, 100% on NRB. Labs notable
normal CK, trop at baseline, BNP>[**Numeric Identifier **]. ECG with ? ST segment
changes in V1,2 thought to be due to J-point elevation. CXR
showed mild congestion consistent with CHF although PNA could
not be excluded. Started on nitro gtt, and also given ASA 325
and tylenol for ?PNA. Renal consulted from ED, no emergent need
for dialysis, planned for AM. Admitted for CHF, hypertensive
urgency.
.
Currently SOB completely resolved. Notes headache that coincided
with initiation of nitro gtt in the ED. No nausea, CP,
diaphoresis, or other complaints.

ECG: sinus, 85bpm, LVH w/ repolarization V1-3, TWI I/AVl,
similar to prior tracing except ST changes V1-3 are slightly
more pronounced
.
CXR: *prelim* prominent vascular markings with ?slight increase
in right base opacity compared to [**2195-8-31**], improved left lung
aeration
.
Prior studies -
.
Echo ([**3-28**]): The left atrium is mildly dilated. The right atrial
pressure is indeterminate. There is moderate symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Tissue
Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling
pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size and free
wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Trace aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
structurally normal. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There
is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 59F h/o ESRD on HD [**2-21**] IgA nephropathy s/p failed cadaveric
transplant, malignant HTN complicated by seizures, diastolic
CHF, Afib, h/o medical non-compliance presented with SOB and
hypertensive urgency.  BP's and SOB normalized after dialysis x2
and patient was discharged home in stable condition.
.
# CHF: Diastolic. EF>55% on [**3-28**] echo. Euvolemic on discharge.
Exacerbation likely due to dietary indiscretion. Also h/o med
noncompliance although denies currently and seems reliable.
Severe HTN contributed to exacerbation.  Patient was started on
a nitro gtt and place on oxygen on arrival to the ICU, both of
which were quickly weaned.  During hemodialysis 3L of fluid
taken off with subsequent resolution in respiratory symptoms.
Repeat dialysis removed an additional 2.2 kg.
.
# Hypertensive urgency: History of med noncompliance and HTN
emergency complicated by seizures. BP 200/100 in the ED without
focal symptoms, improved on nitro gtt. Question of ECG changes
although appear to be consisent with priors and no other
symptoms consistent with angina.  Cardiac enzymes were cycled,
and she received morphine PRN for pain serial ECGs, and fluid
and Na restricted diet with monitoring of both.  Nitro gtt
weaned as pt transitioned to her home medications.  Second round
of HD further improved BPs to 130-150 which is the patient's
baseline pressures.  She was discharged on her home medications
of Toprol XL, Diltiazem ER and a new medication of Lisinopril
20mg.
.
# ESRD: Due to IgA nephropathy s/p failed transplant. On HD as
outpatient, TuThSat, Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 805**] is nephrologist. Does not
produce urine. Renal consulted in ED, and received HD the
morning after presentation and then on out patient schedule.
Continued home renal regimen.  Patient to return to regular
dialysis schedule upon discharge.  Per renal, an additional
0.5kg was removed while in-patient and they suspect patient
needs to be at a slightly lower dry weight.
.
# Headache: Likely due to nitro gtt and temporally coincided and
worsened with improved control of HTN. No other neurologic
symtpoms.  Resolved prior to discharge.
.
# Afib: Stroke risk factors include HTN, currently on ASA 325
daily. Could consider coumadin as likely beneficial, however
defer to outpatient providers. Also has h/o bleeding duodenal
ulcer.
.
# Code Status: DNR/DNI per patient.
