Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3507**]
Chief Complaint:
Fever, pancytopenia, RUQ pain.

History of Present Illness:
HPI:  46 yo M with h/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 2905**] [**Last Name (un) **] s/p thymectomy on Imuran
who initially presented to his PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 151**] T103 and dry cough
treated with Amoxicillin and Augmentin without improvement.  He
was then admitted to an OSH on [**2118-10-25**] for pancytopenia (WBC
2.6, 18% bands, plt 104) and elevated LFTS c/w cholestasis.  He
was treated with Azythromycin and Atovaquone for suspected tick
borne illness.  He had a positive monospot test.  Hepatitis
serologies were negative.
.
Patient was admitted to the surgical service at [**Hospital1 18**] on
[**2118-10-30**] for persisitent fever and an elevated direct Tbili
thought to be secondary to cholangitis.  He was started on
Unasyn.  He underwent an ERCP on [**10-31**] which did not show
biliary tract obstruction, however, a CBD stent was placed.  He
was transfused 1 Unit of PRBC's, 3 bags of FFP, and 3 bags of
plts.
.
Prior to the ERCP he developed repsiratory distress and was
intubated.  CXR revealed bilateral patchy pulmonary infiltrates.
 He became hemodynamically unstable and he was started on Norepi
gtt.  ID was consulted and Ceftriaxone/ Doxycyclin were added;
Zosyn was d/c'ed.  He spiked a temp to 105.3.  He was transfered
to the MICU on [**10-31**] for further managament.

occassionally.  No hx of IVDU.  Lives in [**Location 4310**] near a swamp.

Physical Exam:
Upon transfer to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**]:
Tm 102.2  Tc 97.6  BP 175/92 (108-175/52-92)  HR 89 (71-111)
PS 5/0 FiO2 35% Vt 850 (700-850) RR 16; ABG 7.44/33/173/23
Fentanyl 125; Off Midaz since [**11-6**]
Gen:  Sedated/intubated, appears comfortable on ventilator,
occasional hiccups
HEENT:  ET tube in place,  Eyes with lubricant, PERRL, pupils
pinpoint
CV: distant heart sounds. No murmurs appreciated.
Resp: anteriorly - crackles throughout
Abd: Soft, distended, decreased BM, unable to appreciate HSM
Skin: Warm. Well Perfused.
Ext:  hyperreflexic, Spastic, 5 beats of myoclonus, Toes
upgoing, strong DP/PT pulses
Access:  Right IJ triple lumen placed [**11-6**], Left IJ temp
dialysis cath placed [**11-3**] by IR

Pertinent Results:
Liver US [**10-30**]:
1.  Marked gallbladder wall edema with an effaced, non-distended
gallbladder lumen is noted, without intrahepatic biliary ductal
dilatation. There is minimal pericholecystic fluid.
2.  Dilatation of the proximal CBD.
3.  Prominent periportal lymphadenopathy, nonspecific.
.
CxR [**10-31**]: New perihilar pulmonary edema and bilateral pleural
effusions.
.
ERCP [**10-31**]:
Ccannulation of the common bile duct.  Cholangiogram
demonstrates a normal caliber of the common bile duct and
intrahepatic ducts.  The cystic duct is also filled with
contrast, partially opacifying the gallbladder.  No strictures
or filling defects are identified.  Following cholangiogram,
there is placement of a plastic stent within the common bile
duct.
.
CT Chest/Abd/Pelvis [**10-31**]:
1.  Multifocal pulmonary opacities, which could represent an
infectious process.
2.  Bilateral axillary and right hilar lymphadenopathy, all
could be related to the underlying infectious process.
3.  Moderate bilateral pleural effusions.
4.  Although there is ascites, fluid within the lesser sac and
adjacent to the pancreatic head raises the suspicion of
pancreatitis.
5.  Splenomegaly.
6.  Periportal lymphadenopathy.
.
Echo [**11-1**]:  No evidence of endocarditis. Normal global and
regional
biventricular systolic function. Mild mitral regurgitation.
.
Immunophenotyping [**11-2**]:  Pending
.
Bronchial washings [**11-2**]: NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.
Pulmonary macrophages.  No viral cytopathic changes or
microorganisms seen.
.
R LENI [**11-6**]: No evidence of right lower extremity DVT.
.
CXR [**11-7**]:  Pulmonary edema, now mild, has improved
substantially since [**11-5**].  A relatively rapid onset
between [**10-30**] and 16 and pace of improvement suggests the
diagnosis is cardiogenic rather than noncardiac edema.  Heart is
normal size.  There is no mediastinal or pulmonary vascular
engorgement.  Lungs are clear aside from bands of atelectasis.
Other pleural surfaces are normal except for mild thickening
associated with fractures of left ribs at least the fifth, which
may have developed between [**11-2**] and 21. Tip of the right
jugular line projects over the junction of the brachiocephalic
veins and a left internal jugular line ends in the upper SVC.
.
CT abd/pelvis [**11-7**]:
1. Slightly increased amount of intraabdominal simple free
fluid.
2. Interval placement of CBD stent with collapsed, edematous
gallbladder.
3. Pancreas appears similar to previous exam.
.
CT Head [**11-7**]:
1. No acute intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect.
2. Interval opacification of multiple mastoid air cells.

however, Vanco/Ceftaz were restarted on [**11-7**] for Tm of 102.2.
Concern was for VAP given increased respiratory secretions vs
recurrent pancreatitis with pseudocyst as pancreas enzymes were
rising after recently having restarted TF.  CT Abd/pe
