Aorta - Ascending:  *3.5 cm  <= 3.4 cm
Aorta - Descending Thoracic:  2.3 cm  <= 2.5 cm

Findings
LEFT ATRIUM: No spontaneous echo contrast in the body of the [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **]
[**Last Name (Prefixes) **] LAA. All four pulmonary veins identified and enter the left
atrium.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Secundum ASD.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal regional LV systolic function. Overall
normal LVEF (>55%).

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTA: Normal ascending aorta diameter. Focal calcifications in
ascending aorta. Normal descending aorta diameter. There are
complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.

AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS.
Trace AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. Mild (1+)
MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets. Mild [1+] TR.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Pulmonic valve not well seen.
No PR.

PERICARDIUM: Trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify I was present in compliance with HCFA
regulations. No TEE related complications. The patient was under
general anesthesia throughout the procedure. Suboptimal image
quality - poor echo windows. The patient appears to be in sinus
the patient.

REGIONAL LEFT VENTRICULAR WALL MOTION:





     N = Normal, H = Hypokinetic, A = Akinetic, D = Dyskinetic
Conclusions
PRE CPB No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body of the
left atrium or left atrial appendage. A secundum type atrial
septal defect is present. Regional left ventricular wall motion
is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. There are complex atheroma in the descending aorta.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is a trivial/physiologic
pericardial effusion.

POST CPB There is normal biventricular systolic function. The
interatrial septum is thickened s/p closure of ASD. The discreet
left to right shunt across the septum is no longer present.
There is still some speckled flow between the atria which is
normal so early after closure. There are no other changes from
pre-CPB findings. The thoracic aorta appears intact.
I certify that I was present for this procedure in compliance
with HCFA regulations.

Brief Hospital Course:
Admitted [**12-22**] and underwent CABG x3/ASD closure by Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 1290**]. Transferred to the CSRU in stable condition on
neosynephrine and propofol drips. Extubated that evening but
remained in unit for insulin drip management. Transferred to the
floor on POD #2 to begin increasing his activity level. Chest
tubes and pacing wires removed without incident. Went into Afib
and converted on amiodarone.He also had another brief episode of
SVT and converted back to SR. Cleared for discharge to home with
services on POD #5. Pt. to make all follow-up appts. as per
discharge instructions.
