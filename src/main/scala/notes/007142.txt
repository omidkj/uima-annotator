Admission Date:  [**2120-3-12**]       Discharge Date:  [**2120-3-22**]

Date of Birth:   [**2056-1-3**]       Sex:  F

Service:  MICU-[**Hospital1 **]

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Confusion.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 64-year-old white female
with a history of multiple myeloma, complicated by end-stage
renal disease on hemodialysis, complicated by multiple clots on
Coumadin, who was brought to an outside hospital by her boyfriend
with confusion, nausea and vomiting of black vomitus, and
headache.  Evidently, approximately one month prior to admission
the patient had fallen and hit her head without any neurological
symptoms, loss of consciousness, or sequelae.  Then,
approximately three days prior to admission, the patient was
noted to have increasing confusion by her boyfriend and daughter.
The patient was also noted to have an increase in easy bruising,
anorexia, nausea and vomiting.  Evidently, the patient had been
inadvertently taking Coumadin thinking that it was darvocet,
which she was taking for low back pain.

On review of systems, the patient reported an approximately 60
pound weight loss over the course of six months from a weight of
greater than 200 pounds, with anorexia, diffuse abdominal pain
for about four months, and some bright red blood per rectum for
approximately two months.

At the outside hospital, head CT showed a multiloculated acute on
chronic subdural hematoma, with an INR of 8.3 and a hematocrit of
24.  Initial management included decadron to decrease brain
edema, phenytoin to decrease the risk of seizure, mannitol to
decrease intracranial pressure, and fresh frozen plasma and
Vitamin K to reverse the coagulation deficit.

The patient was transferred to the [**Hospital6 2018**] and admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for
neurological checks, neurosurgical evaluation, and serial head
CTs.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1) Multiple myeloma with light chain
disease for approximately eight years treated with
Thalidomide.  2) Secondary end-stage renal disease, now on
hemodialysis three times per week.  3) Multiple thromboses of
upper extremity AV graft, status post multiple
thrombectomies.  4) SVC syndrome secondary to central line
thrombosis.  5) Hypothyroidism.  6) Chronic anemia.

ALLERGIES:  The patient has GI upset from demerol and
percocet.

MEDICATIONS AT HOME PRIOR TO ADMISSION:  1) Thalidomide 100
mg po qd, 2) ativan with hemodialysis 1 mg tid, 3) Premarin
0.3 mg po qd, 4) Synthroid 0.25 mg po qd, 5) Effexor 150 mg
po qd, 6) Coumadin 2.5 mg po qd, 7) darvocet prn, 8) PhosLo
667 mg po tid.

daughter lives a few houses away on the same street as her. The
patient is a former [**Hospital6 **] employee where
she worked in Telemetry.  The patient denies any tobacco use. The

symmetric, repeats short phrases without difficulty but
recall is limited, patient had a question of mild left-sided
neglect, movement of all extremities spontaneously, no
obvious upper extremity drift, but positive right upper
extremity ataxia-type tremor.  Extremity strength 4+-5
throughout and symmetric, deep tendon reflexes 2+ throughout,
Babinski downgoing, sensation intact throughout to light
touch.

LABORATORY DATA UPON ADMISSION:  CBC with a white blood cell
count of 5.6, with a differential of 69 neutrophils, 29.3
lymphocytes, 3 monocytes, 0.8 eosinophils, 1.3 basophils.
Hematocrit 22.0, platelets 85.  Coagulation studies with a PT
of 29.2, INR 5.6, PTT 43.  Chem-7 with a sodium of 123,
potassium 5.0, chloride 84, BUN 54, creatinine 6.2, glucose

amount of blood, 100 protein, pH 8.5, negative for nitrite
and leukocytes.

HEAD CT ON ADMISSION:  A loculated collection, hemorrhage,
probably of different ages in the right temporal lobe,
asymmetry of the lateral ventricles with mass effect on the
right lateral ventricle, effacement with foci in the right
and a small amount of midline shift to the left.

ASSESSMENT:  A 64-year-old female with acute on chronic subdural
hemorrhage secondary to supertherapeutic Coumadin and fall.

HOSPITAL COURSE - 1) NEUROLOGICAL:  The patient was admitted to
the Medical Intensive Care Unit for neurological checks,
neurosurgical evaluation, and serial head CTs.  Due to the
multiloculated and small size of the subdural hematoma which was
deemed to be acute on chronic, evacuation by neurosurgery was
deferred, although they continued to follow closely throughout
her admission.  The subdural hematoma was treated conservatively
with decadron to reduce brain edema, rapid correction of the INR
with fresh frozen plasma, platelet transfusion to increase the
platelets and keep the level above 100,000, DDAVP to correct
uremic platelet dysfunction.  Upon presentation, the patient's
neurological exam was nonfocal with a question of left-sided
neglect.  After admission to the MICU, the patient developed a
more obvious left facial droop and decreased movement of the left
extremity.  These neurological symptoms had resolved completely
by the time of discharge.  The patient was monitored with serial
head CT scans, receiving a head CT initially twice a day, then
once per day, and then once every other day.  All of these scans
showed a subdural hemorrhage, stable, from the time of admission.
At the time discharge, the subdural hemorrhage continued to be
stable in size and appearance.  The patient was also noted on EEG
during the admission to have evidence of epileptiform activity.
Therefore, the patient was continued on phenytoin throughout
the admission with modification of the dosing based on free
phenytoin levels.

2) PULMONARY:  After admission to the Medical Intensive Care
Unit, the patient became less responsive, agitated, and
tachypneic.  Therefore, the patient was intubated and placed
on a propofol drip.  After the patient's status improved, the
patient was extubated on hospital day #2, and transferred to
the neurological service.  Early on the morning after
transferring to the neurological service, the patient became
again agitated, tachypneic, with oxygen saturations down to the
70s on 100% oxygen via nonrebreather.  The corresponding ABG at
that time was a pH of 7.26, PCO2 47, O2 55.  A code was called at
this point, and the patient was reintubated and transferred back
to the MICU.  Of note, the patient had missed her dialysis
session the previous day due to multiple studies on that day.  In
addition, the patient's previous dialysis session had been cut
short due to studies.  Also, at that time the patient was 10 kg
over her baseline weight.  In addition, the patient had been
maintained on intravenous fluids after admission to the
neurological service.  Therefore, it was felt that the episode of
respiratory failure was most likely due to pulmonary edema in the
setting of volume overload and secondary congestive heart
failure.  With dialysis and careful monitoring of volume status,
the patient improved and was extubated for the second time on
hospital day #5.  After extubation, the patient was noted to
have bulb stridor and wheezing.  The stridor was treated with
racemic epinephrine, hel
