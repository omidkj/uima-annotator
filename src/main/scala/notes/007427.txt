Transferred from MICU with alcoholic hepatitis

none

History of Present Illness:
For full details, please see MICU admission note and the Liver
consult note of [**2116-4-15**]. Briefly, this is a 60 y/o male with
cirrhosis transferred from [**Hospital 1562**] hospital on [**2116-4-14**]. He had
been admitted to the OSH on [**4-5**] after being found down at home;
his course at [**Hospital1 1562**] was complicated by hematemesis requiring
significant blood transfusion (18 units of PRBC), intubation for
airway protection and emergency variceal banding. The patient
had an EtOH level on admission of 203. An EGD on [**4-5**]
demonstrated grade 3 esophageal varices, portal hypertensive
gastropathy, and gastritis. For this he was on pentoxifylline
briefly and started on an octreotide drip from [**Date range (1) 78858**]. In
addition he was febrile to > 101 on [**4-12**] and was started on
vancomycin. A groin line was complicated by arterial puncture
and retroperitoneal bleed. He was transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] for
consultation regarding ? TIPS and evaluation for liver
transplantation.
At the [**Hospital1 18**] he was hemodynamically stable. A vascular consult
was obtained for evaluation of his RP bleed and decided not to
intervene. A liver consult was obtained and the patient was
restarted on pentoxifylline. He did not have any steroids
started given the concern for possible infection. A CT
demonstrated emphysema, RML/RLL collapse, and multifocal
interstitial abnormality concerning for PNA v. pulmonary
fibrosis. He was continued on his regimen of
ceftriaxone/vancomycin for presumed hospital acquired PNA.
He is currently refusing to answer any questions as he is upset
that we woke him up.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was transferred from an outside hospital with acute
alcoholic hepatitis for consideration of TIPS.  The patient was
critically ill with a discriminant function of over 100.  After
stabilization in the ICU he was transferred to the floor, where
he became progressively hypotensive and had continually
worsening renal failure. The option of liver transplantation was
ruled out due to his recent alcohol abuse and active infection.
The patient was made DNR/DNI and after discussion with the
family the decision was made to make him CMO as he continued to
fail.
