Attending:[**Last Name (un) 11974**]
Chief Complaint:
SOB

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Thoracentesis

History of Present Illness:
69yo M PMHx Severe aortic stenosis ([**Location (un) 109**] 0.9cm2), s/dCHF (EF 20%
[**8-/2138**]), recurrent L-sided pleural effusion attributed to CHF,
AV node dysfunction s/p PPM ([**2-/2138**]), COPD, CKD, and multiple
recent hospital stays for shortness of breath, notable for
CABG/AVR w/u but subsequent refusal of surgical intervention,
now presenting with SOB. Patient reports SOB has been worsening
since discharge 1d prior to this presentation. He denies CP,
palpitations, nausea/vomitting/diarrhea, HA, weakness.
.
Initial vital signs in the ED were 98.5 74 120/60 16 95%. Exam
was notable for crackles throughout lung fields. Labs were
significant for WCC 11.5 (6.1 at discharge), Hct 31.1, Cr 3.8
(3.7 at discharge), CXR demonstrated fluid overload w stable
large L pleural effusion. CT [**Doctor First Name **] was consulted but given
patient's refusal of surgical interventions in the past they
recommended medicine admission. Patient was admitted to medicine
for further management of shortness of breath. Vitals at time of
transfer were 98.6 77 131/76 22 100%2LNC.
.
On arrival to the floor, initial vital signs were 96.3 143/70 73
28 93%4L. Patient denied any pain or discomfort, but his
tachypnea interfered w conducting a full review of systems. On
the day of admission the pt was transferred to the CCU due to
concern for evolving sepsis in the setting of likely PNA and CHF
exacerbation.

Microbiology:
No growth on multiple blood, urine, or pleural fluid cultures.

PERTINENT REPORTS:
.
CXR ([**2138-9-1**]): Interval increase in size of a now large left
pleural effusion with associated bilateral lower lobe
atelectasis and moderate edema.

CXR [**2138-9-14**]: Lines and catheters are in satisfactory position.
There is pulmonary edema which may be slightly increased. Right
lung is well aerated with persistent left basilar opacity,
probably a combination of pleural effusion and atelectasis or
consolidation. This has remained unchanged.

IMPRESSION:
1. Persistent opacity at the left lung base with mild increase
in pulmonary edema.

TTE [**2138-9-8**]:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. The estimated right
atrial pressure is at least 15 mmHg. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity is
moderately dilated. There is moderate to severe global left
ventricular hypokinesis with relative preservation of anterior
septal and basal inferolateral contraction. The remaining
segments are severely hypokinetic (LVEF = 25 %). [Intrinsic left
ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the
severity of valvular regurgitation.] No masses or thrombi are
seen in the left ventricle. Right ventricular chamber size is
normal with depressed free wall contractility. There is severe
aortic valve stenosis (valve area 0.9cm2). Moderate (2+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is
moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a very
small pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Left ventricular cavity enlargement with global
hypokinesis c/w diffuse process (multivessel CAD, toxin,
metabolic, etc.). Severe aortic valve stenosis. Moderate aortic
regurgitation. Pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. Moderate
mitral regurgitation.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed), anterior septal
motion is improved. The gradient across the aortic valve is
increased with similar aortic valve area. The severity of mitral
regurgitation is slightly increased.


Brief Hospital Course:
PRIMARY REASON FOR ADMISSION: 69yo M PMHx Severe aortic stenosis
([**Location (un) 109**] 0.8cm2, peak gradient 66mmHg), s/dCHF (EF 20%), recurrent
L-sided pleural effusion attributed to CHF, AV node dysfunction
s/p PPM ([**2-/2138**]), COPD, CKD, and multiple recent hospital stays
for shortness of breath, notable for CABG/AVR w/u but subsequent
refusal of surgical intervention, now presenting with SOB.
.
ACTIVE DIAGNOSES:
# Shortness of Breath: Pt with s/d CHF (EF 20% [**8-/2138**]), critical
AS (valve area 0.9 cm2), as well as recurrent L pleural effusion
that has previously been attributed to CHF, presenting w
worsening SOB, CXR
