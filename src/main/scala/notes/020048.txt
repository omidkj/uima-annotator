Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2569**]

Right-sided weakness

Administration of intravenous TPA

History of Present Illness:
The pt is a 88 year-old HTN, peripheral vascular disease (per
daughter she had some type of right leg bypass surgery), severe
RA, GERD, non-ambulatory secondary to severe arthritis and pain
who presents as code stroke as a transfer from OSH after being
given tPA.

The patient was in her usual state of health this afternoon.
She was at home with her daughter.  At about 4:30 her daughter
briefly left the patient for about 5 minutes.  On returning
back, she noted that her mother was slumped over in her chair
towards the right side .  She noted that her mother appear to
have a right facial droop and her right arm was dangling at her
side. The daughter attempted to lift the arm above she found
that it dropped to her side and she was not able to hold it up
against gravity.  The daughter also noted that the patient
appear to have difficulty speaking.  She could not form full
sentences.  She appeared to understand what was being said and
could follow
simple commands.  She was able to say her daughter's name and
her son's name, as well as "me" but could not put these words
into sentences.  The daughter did not believe there was any
change in the patient's legs.  She saw her move both legs.  The
patient is not ambulatory at baseline due to severe arthritis
and pain in her legs.  She apparently can take [**1-31**] steps with a
walker but spends most of her time in a wheelchair.  Based on
these concerns the patient was taken to her local ED, [**Hospital 6451**] at about 4:45.

The patient arrived at the OSH where she had a head CT which was
unremarkable.  There she was given a NIH stroke scale of 14.
Based on her symptoms the stroke fellow at [**Hospital1 18**] was contact[**Name (NI) **]
and told about the case.  The patient had normal labs, coags,
and based on the symptoms and time of onset it was decided to
give the patient tpa.  The tpa was given at 7:00pm, 2.5 hours
after the onset of symptoms.  She was given a 4.5mg bolus and
then an
infusion of 40mg over 1 hour.  She was stabilized and then sent
to [**Hospital1 18**] for the post tpa protocol.  After being given tpa and
while on route the patient was noted to have a significantly
improved exam.  She was able to lift her right arm antigravity
and her speech improved to where she was able to speak in full
sentences.  When she arrived to [**Hospital1 18**] she was given a stroke
scale of 4 (detailed below).  She was able to answer all
questions, could repeat, had only a mild naming difficulty.  As
she had improved significantly it was decided not to persue any
further intervention.  She was admitted to the ICU for further
management.

Of note her right lower extremity was noted to be erythematous,
and warm.  Per the daughter it is always somewhat discolored
although has been worse over the last 2-3 days.
