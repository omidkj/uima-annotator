Allergies:
Vasotec / Niacin

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 14145**]
Chief Complaint:
Diarrhea, Delirium.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None.

History of Present Illness:
This is an 86 year old male with ischemic cardiomyopathy
(ejection fraction 17%), prior ST-elevation myocardial
infarction (STEMI), peripheral vascular disease (PVD), who
presented with worsening fatigue and diarrhea. His family noted
worsened malaise, fatigue, diarrhea, over past week, also with
loose, non-bloody stools over the prior 3 days, then with
decreased oral intake. His wife had noticed more sundowning at
night-time, worse than normal. Of note, he recently started
Digoxin and diuresed with Diuril from wt of 160lbs to admission
wt ~140lbs. Outpatient EKG showed lateral lead scooping on
[**12-2**].

In [**Hospital1 18**] ED, 95/50, 95% room air, HR 70, lungs clear
bilaterally, guaiac (-), otherwise benign exam. EKG showed
lateral lead scooping. He was given Aspirin 325, Lidocaine Jelly
2% (Urojet) 5mL Urojet. The patient dropped SBP to 70s, given 3
250cc boluses, with appropriate bump to 90s, asymptomatic. Out
of concern for Digoxin toxicity, Digibind was given, but then
stopped after Dig level returned at 1 (only half vial
administered). Toxicology was consulted. CXR showed trace bil
effusions, streaky atelectasis in RLL, final read possible
pneumonia. He was given Levaquin and ceftriaxone for CAP.
Cardiology consulted: recs for careful fluid resuscitation. 2
large bore pIVs. He was admitted to MICU for concern for
evolving pneumo-sepsis.

Chest x-ray [**2166-12-8**]:
AP view of the chest in upright position was obtained. The
patient is status post CABG and mitral valve replacement. The
cardiac silhouette is enlarged and unchanged. There is hazy
consolidation in the right lung base with associated pleural
effusion. The pulmonary vasculature is engorged without overt
pulmonary edema. There is no pneumothorax. The osseous
structures are unchanged.

IMPRESSION: Findings consistent with right lower lung pneumonia
and associated pleural effusion.


ECHO [**2166-12-9**]:
The left atrium is markedly dilated. There is mild symmetric
left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is
mildly dilated. There is severe global left ventricular
hypokinesis (LVEF = 15-20% %). The right ventricular cavity is
mildly dilated with moderate global free wall hypokinesis. The
aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. The aortic
valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is moderate to
severe aortic valve stenosis (area 0.8-1.0cm2). Mild to moderate
([**1-22**]+) aortic regurgitation is seen. A bioprosthetic mitral
valve prosthesis is present. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral
regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.] The
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate to
severe tricuspid regurgitation is seen. The estimated pulmonary
artery systolic pressure is normal. The pulmonic valve leaflets
are thickened. There is no pericardial effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2166-4-22**], the
severity of aortic stenosis has progressed. The other findings
are similar.

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 86 year old male with ischemic CMA, EF 20-25%, prior
STEMI, PVD, p/w worsening fatigue and diarrhea, admitted to MICU
with hypotension, now stable on floor:

In [**Hospital1 18**] ED, 95/50, 95% room air, HR 70, lungs clear
bilaterally, guaiac (-), otherwise benign exam. EKG showed
lateral lead scooping. He was given Aspirin 325, Lidocaine Jelly
2% (Urojet) 5mL Urojet. The patient dropped SBP to 70s, given 3
250cc boluses, with appropriate bump to 90s, asymptomatic. Out
of concern for Digoxin toxicity, Digibind was given, but then
stopped after Dig level returned at 1 (only half vial
administered). Toxicology was consulted. CXR showed trace
bilateral effusions, streaky atelectasis in RLL, final read
possible pneumonia. He was given Levaquin and ceftriaxone for
CAP. Cardiology was consulted with recommendations for careful
fluid resuscitation. 2 large bore pIVs were placed, and the
patient was admitted to the MICU for concern for evolving
pneumo-sepsis.

MICU course: BP 70/40, three 500cc bolus with good response.
Levo/ceftriaxone for pneumonia was continued initially. No
leukocytosis fever or tachycardia, no tachypnea. Digoxin,
Amiodarone and diuretics were initially held. He was in the unit
for two days. As patient was stable and infiltrate on CXR found
to be chronic, antibiotics were discontinued [**12-10**]. His Troponin
was measured at 0.21. Hypotension is considered, perhaps, an
element of his worsening AS with overdiuresis. The MICU did not
restart dig or diuretics. Metoprolol was restarted. New acute
renal failure was considered pre-renal in etiology.

On the floor, the patient's Cr continued to improve and
gradually, the patient was restarted on a diuresis regimen with
Torsemide. On discharge, the patient was started on low-dose
Coumadin for his afib and low EF.
