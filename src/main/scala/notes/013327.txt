Brief Hospital Course:
ICU course:

The patient was admitted directly to the ICU with hypotension
secondary to septic shock with a gram negative rod septicemia.
The source of her infection was a left lower lobe pneumonia.
Initially, there was concern over a possible soft tissue
infection of her right leg.  Surgery was consult for possible
debridement; however, after consultation it was felt that the
patient's leg edema and tenderness was secondary to chronic
changes from a healing laceration and was only mildly
cellulitic.

She was initially started on Zosyn, vancomycin, and clindamycin
to cover skin flora, typical pulmonic pathogens, and pseudomonas
given her diabetes and immune compromised state with chronic
prednisone and methotrexate therapy.  She was bolused with
additional saline upon arrival to the ICU and was quickly weaned
off of pressors.  She was also started on stress dose
hydrocortisone given her daily use of prednsione (35mg/day).
She continued to improve clinically, and was transfered to the
general medicine floor.

Floor Course:
Her bacteremia grew out as [**4-14**] GNR (Klebsiella, R to amp,
bactrim).  She was switched to levaquin (renally dosed) at this
point.  A CXR shows ? LLL infiltrate that may be source of
bacteremia. Abd CT was obtained that showed:
[**7-2**]: Abd CT: small R pleural effusion, bibasilar atelectasis,
consolidation in L lung base- ? atelectasis vs PNA, no source of
infection in abdomen.
She was switched back to her home dose of prednisone (35 mg qd)
due to improvement and stable BPs.  Her ARF resolved with
hydration and she was switched to [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **].l dose of Levaquin.
Her thrush was treated effectively with nystatin s+s.  Her
metformin was initially held due to lactic acidosis and she was
treated with minimal amounts of SSI.  Her metformin was then
slowly restarted in the hospital.  Her accuchecks have been
stable and acceptable.  Due to aspiration worries, she had a
video swallowing study which showed adequate ability to swallow
without aspiration.  She does take pills better in pudding, etc.
Her central line was removed after several days of stability and
she was given mild diuresis with IV Lasix here to help resolve
LE edema.  Upon discharge, her vitals have been stable and she
continues to have LE edema, but this is improving with diuresis.
 Her asthma was treated with standing nebs of albuterol and
atrovent.  Will send her out with MDI for this with prn nebs as
backup.  Lastly, her MTX was held while in the hospital.  She
will follow up with rheumatology to determine when to restart
this.  Accordingly, her bactrim and folate were held.  Given
patient's decreased level of functioning, rehab was recommended
by PT.  She was seen by surgery about her leg wound and they
recommended not closing the wound.  It would be better to allow
it to heal by secondary intention.  It is currently draining
serosang. fluid, but there is no evidence of infection.  Will
have her PCP/rehab hospital monitor this and change bandages as
needed.
Her atenolol was held during admission and restarted at 1/2 dose
upon discharge.
