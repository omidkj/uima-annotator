Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 922**]
Chief Complaint:
Myocardial infarction

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
1. Placement of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation circuit and
cannulae in the catheterization laboratory.
2. Emergent coronary artery bypass grafting x3 with the
saphenous vein grafts to the marginal artery, left anterior
descending artery and right coronary artery.
3. Placement of Abiomed BVS 5000 left ventricular assist device.
4. Bilateral groin exploration with repair of arterial and
venous puncture sites.
5. Exploration, evacuation of hematoma
6. Exploratory laparotomy, left colectomy


History of Present Illness:
This is a 72-year-old male who had a h/o coronary artery disease
and underwent a left anterior descending artery stent about a
month ago. He persisted in
having chest pains and he was brought back to the
catheterization lab in an attempt to angioplasty his left
anterior descending artery as well as his right coronary artery.
During his catheterization, he developed a clot in his left main
and left anterior descending artery. He went into ventricular
tachycardia and arrested. Chest compressions were initiated. CT
surgery was called down to the catheterization lab where we set
up an ECMO circuit and reinserted a 15-French cannula in the
right femoral artery percutaneously followed by a 24-French
venous cannula up to the right femoral vein percutaneously. The
ECMO was initiated and we stopped chest compressions. We then
brought him to the
operating room emergently for a coronary artery bypass grafting
and a possible left ventricular assist device placement. We had
discussed the risks and benefits with his daughter, who agreed
with us to proceed.

Brief Hospital Course:
On [**2155-8-15**], Mr. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to the cardiac surgery service
under the care of Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 914**] following an emergent CABG. For
details of the operation please see Dr.[**Name (NI) 9379**] operative
report. Post-operatively Mr. [**Known lastname **] had a very complicated course.
He was in critical condition from the start. He was cared for in
the CSRU with a left ventricular assist device. He underwent an
exploratory laparotomy on [**8-18**] with resection of his left colon
secondary to ischemic colitis. Mr. [**Known lastname 68200**] cardiovascular status
never recovered from the initial infarct, and required
defibrillation multiple times throughout the course of his ICU
stay. On [**2155-8-20**], after long discussion with family members, it
was decided to make him comfort measures only. He expired at
2:35 pm.
