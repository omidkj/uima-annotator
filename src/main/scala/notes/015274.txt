Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1167**]
Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea on exertion, Observation post-pericardial drainage.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Pericardiocentesis


History of Present Illness:
Ms [**Known lastname 61077**] is a 65-year-old female with left renal cell
carcinoma s/p nephrectomy ([**2117**]), who was found to have a
pericardial effusion.
.
A CT scan last wednesday ([**6-11**]) revealed volume overload with
increased pleural and pericardial effusions, pulmonary and
periportal edema and ascites. She also felt unwell and developed
a cough with purulent sputum. She was started on Levaquin as an
outpatient, but continued to have shortness of breath. This
shortness of breath lasted for the last 2 weeks but became worse
in the past 24 hours. She could not ambulate up a flight of
stairs and had to be assisted into a wheelchair, and ended up
cyanotic and diaphoretic by the time she reached her follow-up
appointment. An echocardiogram that afternoon revealed an EF of
>70% and early signs of cardiac tamponade (collapsed right
atrium but not ventricle). She was transferred to the cardiac
floor for further management.
.
On arrival to the floor, her initial vitals were as follows: T
97.7 BP 149/96 HR 95 RR 18 SaO2 98% on room air. Labs and
imaging were significant for Na 131, Cr 0.9 and ALT 51. Her
urinalysis was negative.
.
On review of systems, she reports some occasional rib pain on
her posterior back. She also had a lot of nausea and vomiting
last week but that has resolved. She did not have any TB
exposure or recent travel.
.
Otherwise, she denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep
venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of
surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools
or red stools. She denies recent fevers, chills or rigors. She
denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other review
of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
dizziness, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema,
palpitations, syncope or presyncope.
.
500ccs were drained during pericardiocentesis by Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **].
