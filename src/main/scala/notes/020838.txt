presenting from [**Hospital3 **] with altered mental status.

he was holding things that werent there, or that he could walk.
WBC elevated on [**10-20**], empirically started on cipro and
linezolid for a LLL infiltrate on CXR at [**Hospital1 **].  On [**10-21**],
mental status had iproved and WBC decrased, however on AM of
admission mental status was worse.  AOx3, but at [**Hospital1 **] he
thought he was walking around and is occasionally not oriented

fluconazole 150 mg PO x1, ceftiraxone 1 gm IV x1.  Head CT neg
for acute bleed, CXR showed small RLL opacity.  On UA, moderate
yeast, few bacteria, WBC [**10-23**], Tr leuks.
