  RADIOLOGY
==============
.
CHEST, AP: The examination is suboptimal due to
underpenetration, patient
motion, and low lung volumes. The lungs are clear without
consolidation or
edema. There is mild crowding of vascular markings. Note is made
of tracheal wall calcifications. There are no pleural effusions
or pneumothorax.
There is unchanged moderate cardiomegaly. The aorta is slightly
tortuous.
A right dual-lumen central venous catheter is again seen with
tip in the mid right atrium.
IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary process.
.

EKG: IVCD, slightly worse STE in AVR and STD in II. LAE.
.
ECHO: 2/110/10: EF 30-40%, global hypokinesis. Mild LVH w/ wall
thickness of 1.4, symmetric. RV normal. indeterminate PASP.
Severe MAC, 1+MR. Mild AS.
.
CXR [**2162-4-22**]: moderate CHF, bilateral pleural effusions (small),
no focal infiltrate, Tunneled Right sided HD catheter in RA.


Brief Hospital Course:
75 yoF w/ a h/o HTN, DM, ESRD on HD (T,T,Sa) presents with acute
onset SOB.

SOB/Hypoxia: The patient had acute onset shortness of breath. EF
is 30-40 and also has moderate LVH She improved with positive
pressure and a nitro gtt. She is very hypertensive and the
likely cause is fluid overload. Etiology of heart failure is
presumed to be hypertensive heart disease however the patient
has never had a cardiac cath, and her hypokinesis is global.
She ruled out for an MI.  SOB markedly improved with dialysis
and ultrafiltration.  The patient was dialyzed on Thursday,
underwent UF for 2L on Friday and dialyzed again on Saturday
with another 2 L removed.  Her new dry weight is 53 kg.  She was
sating 100% while supine on room air prior to discharge.  She
should continue irbesartan (switched to losartan while at the
[**Hospital1 18**] for formulary reasons) and carvedilol 12.5mg po bid upon
discharge.  After

Eospinophilia: Has had this in the past without clear
explanation. Has had negative stool O&P, in addition has had a
normal cortisol in the past and there has been a thought of
possible sarcoid but this has not been further evaluated.  Stool
O&P was negative.  She should follow up with an allergist.  Dr.
