her baseline given her asthma.  She endorses cough productive of

exacerbations.  She denies hemoptysis, chest pain/pressure,
orthopnea, palpitations, abdominal pain, hematemesis, melena,

Physical Exam:
VS: T 99.8, P 100, BP 159/47, RR 17, SaO2 95% 4L NC
GEN: elderly woman speaking in full sentences but with mildly
increased work of breathing, moderately diaphoretic
SKIN: no rash/jaundice
HEENT: NC/AT, PERRL, EOMI, MMM
NECK: supple, no LAD
PULM: poor air movement to bases, + expiratory wheezes in upper
lung fields b/l, subtle rales in lower fields b/l, no dullness
to percussion, prolonged I:E
CV: RRR, nl S1/S2, no mrg, no S3/S4, JVP ~7 cm, no carotid
bruits
ABD: active bowel sounds, tender to palpation in epigastrium,
soft, nondistended, no organomegaly

NEURO: AOx3, moves all extremities

Pertinent Results:
- CXR [**1-4**]: 1. Overall stable since earlier today with increased
lung markings in the right lower lobe which are nonspecific and
could be representing pneumonia.
2. New blunting of the left costophrenic angle which could
represent
atelectasis or a small effusion.
- EKG [**1-4**] (compared to ):
- Spirometry [**10-15**]: FVC- 73%, FEV1- 50%, FEV1/FVC- 88%
- TTE [**1-5**]: Left atrium normal size. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses normal. LV hyperdynamic w/ EF>75%. Trivial MR. LV
inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation. PA pressure not
determined.

Brief Hospital Course:
69F h/o asthma p/w 2d N/V/diarrhea [**1-12**] C. diff colitis; also
with COPD flare, PNA.
.
# SOB - Likely asthma/COPD exacerbation in setting of PNA,
treated with prednisone, nebs, and levofloxain. Remained
afebrile and exam improved daily and leukocytosis trended down
until steroids started. Urine legionella negative. TTE performed
c diastolic dysfunction but given underlying PNA & wheeze, SOB
deemed less likely CHF. She was weaned off supplemental O2. The
patient will continue prednisone taper (50, 40, 30, 20, 10, off)
as outpatient. Cont levofloxacin to complete 10 day course
(started [**1-6**]). Continued inhalers, nebs, and theophylline
(decreased to 200 mg [**Hospital1 **] given elevated level -> normal on
recheck). Followup with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 575**] from pulmonary.
.
# N/V/diarrhea - C. diff colitis verified by positive toxin.
Received unknown antibiotic when had "flu" 3 weeks ago. Diarrhea
resolved with flagyl, tolerating POs and no abdominal pain.
Continue flagyl to complete 14 day course after finishing
levofloxacin.
.
# Anemia - Microcytic. Baseline Hct low 30's, trended down to 27
briefly then returned to baseline and remained stable. Stools
guiac negative. Fe studies suggest ACD, although given markedly
low iron and microcytic may be mixed picture.
.
# Depression - Continued lexapro.
.
# GERD - Continued PPI.
.
# HTN - Elevated BPs while inpatient with SBP 140-160's. The
patient is not on anti-hypertensives at home. No medications
started while inpatient. Defer further evaluation and management
to PCP once acute issues resolve.
