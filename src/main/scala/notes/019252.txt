Chief Complaint:
Failure to wean from ventilator s/p intubation for a COPD
exacerbation.

Peg tube placement on [**2122-4-15**].

History of Present Illness:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 60965**] is a 70-year-old woman with a history of COPD, HTN,
and CAD who was transferred from [**Location (un) 60966**] for failure to wean
from a ventilator after intubation and eventual trachetomy after
a COPD exacerbation.  The patient was initally admitted to the
OSH on [**3-25**].  Her course was complicated by multifocal atrial
tachycardia, steroid induced hyperglycemia, alcalagines
oxyosidans bronchitis, and c. diff colitis. Pt was eventually
trached secondary to her failure to wean. On [**4-11**], the pt was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for continued care due to her failure to
wean.

Past Medical History:
1. [**Name (NI) 3672**] Pt has had COPD for 10 to 15 years. She has required
multiple intubation inthe last 5 years.
2. HTN

6. S/P vertebral fractures
7. Osteopenia

Pt is married and lives with her husband. [**Name (NI) **] is her primary care
giver. They have seven children who are very involved. She quit
smoking 20 years ago after smoking 1 PPD for many years.

LIVER OR GALLBLADDER US (SINGLE ORGAN) PORT  [**2122-4-12**]:
RIGHT UPPER QUADRANT ULTRASOUND: The liver is diffusely
echogenic, consistent with fatty infiltration. More advanced
forms of liver disease such as advanced fibrosis/cirrhosis
cannot be excluded on this study. There is no intrahepatic
biliary ductal dilatation or focal hepatic mass. The gallbladder
is not distended. There are low level echoes in the dependent
portion of the gallbladder that is consistent with sludge. There
is no gallbladder wall thickening or edema. No stones are
identified. The common duct measures 2 mm. There is a small
amount of free fluid in the abdomen and pelvis noted, with small
slivers of fluid around the liver, a small amount of fluid
between the liver and gallbladder, and a sliver of fluid in the
left lower quadrant.
IMPRESSION:
1) Echogenic liver consistent with fatty infiltration. More
advanced forms of liver disease cannot be excluded.
2) There is sludge within the gallbladder. There is no intra- or
extrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation. The gallbladder is
otherwise unremarkable.
3) Very small amount of ascites as described.

PORTABLE ABDOMEN  [**2122-4-12**]:
INDICATION: Abdominal tenderness. Question free air or
obstruction.
A single portable abdominal radiograph is submitted for
interpretation. It demonstrates a nonobstructed bowel gas
pattern. The exam is not labeled as to whether it was performed
in the upright or supine position. A nasogastric tube terminates
in the stomach with the sideport near the GE junction level.
Scoliosis is noted as well as degenerative change in the spine.
There are also apparent compression fractures within the spine.
IMPRESSION: Nonobstructed bowel gas pattern. Additional left
lateral decubitus abdominal radiograph may be helpful given
clinical suspicion for free intraperitoneal air.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2122-4-12**]:
A left subclavian vascular catheter terminates within the
superior vena cava at the junction with left brachiocephalic
vein. There is no pneumothorax. Allowing for rotation of the
patient, a tracheostomy tube is in satisfactory position. A
nasogastric tube terminates in the stomach. Heart size is
normal, and the lungs appear clear.
IMPRESSION: Vascular catheter in satisfactory position with no
pneumothorax.

Cardiology Report ECHO Study Date of [**2122-4-13**]:
MEASUREMENTS:
Aortic Valve - Peak Velocity: *3.1 m/sec (nl <= 2.0 m/sec)
Aortic Valve - Peak Gradient: 38 mm Hg
Aortic Valve - Mean Gradient: 21 mm Hg
Mitral Valve - E Wave: 0.9 m/sec
Mitral Valve - A Wave: 1.1 m/sec
Mitral Valve - E/A Ratio: 0.82
Mitral Valve - E Wave Deceleration Time: 280 msec
Findings:
LEFT ATRIUM: Normal LA size.
RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Normal RA size.
LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV cavity size. Mildly depressed LVEF.
Cannot assess LVEF.
RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.
AORTA: Normal aortic root diameter.
AORTIC VALVE: Moderately thickened aortic valve leaflets. Mild
AS. Trace AR.
MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. Moderate
mitral annular calcification. Mild (1+) MR. LV inflow pattern
c/w impaired relaxation.
PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.
Conclusions:
1. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left
ventricular
systolic function is difficult to assess but is probably mildly
depressed.
Overall left ventricular EF cannot be reliably assessed.
2. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is
mild aortic
valve stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
3. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+)
mitral
regurgitation is seen.

Brief Hospital Course:
1. Pulmonary: The patient's failure to wean from the ventilator
seemed secondary to deconditioning.  She was continued on a slow
IV steroid taper for her COPD, though she seemed to do well from
a bronchospasm and inflammation standpoint.  She was exercised
on CPAP but will require continued pulmonary rehab as she is
weaned from the ventilator.

2. ID: The patient had been treated at the OSH with
metronidazole for c. diff colitis.  She spiked at temperature at
