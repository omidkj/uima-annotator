Admission Date:  [**2196-12-9**]     Discharge Date:  [**2196-12-13**]

Date of Birth:   [**2139-8-30**]     Sex:  F

Service:  CCU

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 56 year old
woman with a past medical history significant only for asthma
and a positive family history for coronary artery disease,
who presented to the Emergency Room with onset of epigastric
pressure at 5:30 p.m. on the day of admission.

The patient had been brought to the Emergency Room by
emergency medical services.  An electrocardiogram in the
Emergency Room showed inferior ST elevations and reciprocal
ST depressions.  She was given morphine and aspirin by
emergency medical technicians.  Heparin was started in the
Emergency Room.  She also received sublingual nitroglycerin
times one.

Prior to a cardiac catheterization, the patient received an
Integrilin drip, Lopressor and a nitroglycerin drip.  The
patient was taken urgently to the catheterization laboratory,
where she was enrolled in the "Cool MI" protocol.  She was
randomized to the "warm" arm of the study.

In the catheterization laboratory, cardiac output was 5.86,
cardiac index 3.25, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure 16,
pulmonary artery pressure 43/24 with a mean pressure of 18.
Right ventricular pressure was 44/14 with a mean of 21.  The
left main coronary artery was normal.  The left anterior
descending artery had mild diffuse disease with 50% to 60%
stenosis.  The left circumflex had a 50% lesion in the obtuse
marginal one branch.  The right coronary artery had a 99%
mid-thrombus which was stented and an 80% posterolateral
lesion which was also stented.  The catheterization was
complicated by transient hypotension and bradycardia that
responded to atropine times one.  A temporary pacemaker wire
was inserted and subsequently removed at the end of the
catheterization and a Lidocaine drip was started.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1.  Asthma.  2.  Anxiety.

ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Steroid meter dose inhaler,
albuterol meter dose inhaler, Celexa and [**Doctor First Name **].

FAMILY HISTORY:  Family history is positive for early
coronary artery disease in the patient's brother (age 50s).

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient works at [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 3867**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]
[**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **].  She denies alcohol or tobacco use.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On physical examination, the patient
was afebrile with a heart rate of 89, blood pressure 159/97,
respiratory rate 17 and oxygen saturation 98% on two liters
nasal cannula.  General:  Alert, pleasant middle-aged woman
in no acute distress lying in bed.  Head, eyes, ears, nose
and throat:  Normocephalic, atraumatic, extraocular movements
intact, pupils equal, round, and reactive to light and
accommodation, moist mucous membranes.  Neck:  Supple, no
jugular venous distention.  Chest:  Clear to auscultation
bilaterally.  Cardiovascular:  Regular rate and rhythm,
normal S1 and S2, no murmur, rub or gallop.  Abdomen:  Soft,
nontender, nondistended, positive bowel sounds.  Extremities:
Peripheral pulses 2+ bilaterally with no cyanosis, clubbing
or edema, sheath in place in right groin without hematoma.
Neurologic examination:  Alert and oriented times three,
slightly anxious, cranial nerves II through XII intact.

LABORATORY DATA:  White blood cell count was 17 with 82%
neutrophils, 0 bands and 13% lymphocytes, hematocrit 42.6,
platelet count 291,000, and Chem-7 was unremarkable.  An
initial CK was 80 with a troponin of less than 0.3.
Pre-cardiac catheterization electrocardiogram indicated
normal sinus rhythm at a rate of 70 beats per minute, [**Street Address(2) 2051**]
elevations in leads II, III and AVF and [**Street Address(2) 1766**] elevations in
leads V3, V4 and V5, there were also [**Street Address(2) 1766**] depressions in
leads AVL, V2 and I.  Electrocardiogram following cardiac
catheterization indicated normal sinus rhythm at 100 beats
per minute, [**Street Address(2) 97830**] elevations in leads V2, V3 and
III, while other ST segment changes were resolved.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the Coronary
Care Unit for hemodynamic monitoring and telemetry.  She
complained of no further episodes of chest pain or abdominal
discomfort.  There was no further ventricular ectopy noted
and her Lidocaine drip was discontinued.  She received
Integrilin for 18 hours following cardiac catheterization.
CKs peaked at 2,275 with an MB fraction of 467 and an index
of 20.5.  Troponin peaked at greater than 50.

The patient was started on an ACE inhibitor, aspirin, Plavix
and Lipitor.  She was also cautiously started on a beta
blocker given her history of asthma, and tolerated Lopressor
without difficulty.  She was transferred to the floor on
hospital day number two.  A transthoracic echocardiogram
indicated a left ventricular ejection fraction of 50% to 55%
with basal inferoseptal hypokinesis and basal inferior
hypokinesis.  There was 1+ mitral regurgitation and 1+
tricuspid regurgitation.

The patient was seen by physical therapy and cleared for a
safe discharged to home.  She was switched to daily dosing of
atenolol and lisinopril.

FOLLOW-UP:  The patient was instructed to follow up with Dr.
[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] of cardiology in four to six weeks following
discharged, and was also to be followed up as part of the
"Cool MI" study.

1.  Acute inferior myocardial infarction.
2.  Coronary artery disease, cardiac catheterization and
    stenting of the right coronary artery and posterolateral
    branch.
