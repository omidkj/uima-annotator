Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 64386**] was admitted on [**8-18**] an echo from an outside hospital
that showed a partially flail mitral leaflet and severe MR.  [**Name13 (STitle) **]
was taken on [**8-20**] for cardiac catheterization which showed EF
30%, [**4-19**]+MR, 100%RCA lesion 50% LCx and LAD lesions.  He was
evaluated by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for surgical intervention and it was
decided that he would benefit from surgery.  He had an
evaluation by the dental service and it was determined that
tooth #30 had a lesion on the distal root.  It was decided that
the patient could be on perioperative antibiotics and have the
tooth evaluated and extracted after surgery.  He was started on
ampicillin and was taken to the operating room on [**8-23**] by Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] and underwent MVR with [**Street Address(2) 7163**]. [**Male First Name (un) 923**] mechanical valve,
CABGx2 with LIMA-LAD and SVG-PDA and a MAZE procedure for atrial
fibrillation.  Please see operative note for further details.
He was transferred to the intensive care unit in stable
condition and was weaned and extubated from mechanical
ventilation on POD#0 without difficulty.  His chest tubes and
pacing wires were removed without incident and he was stared on
Coumadin for his mechanical valve and atrial fibrillation.  He
was started on amiodarone to help convert the patient to sinus
rhythm.  On POD#3 he was transferred from the ICU to the regular
floor and began ambulating with physical therapy.  He was able
to walk 500 feet and climb 1 flight of stairs without difficulty
and his INR was 2.4.  He was cleared for discharge to home on
POD#4.
