Allergies:
Iron Dextran Complex / Bupropion

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2485**]
Chief Complaint:
dyspnea, volume overload

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
hemodialysis

History of Present Illness:
59 M c hx of systolic CHF, DM2, HTN, Hep C, ESRD on
HD(tuthrsat), who p/w shortness of breath to ED on [**12-9**].
Patient was subsequently found to be severely hypertensive to
220s, started on nitroglycerin gtt, and transfered to MICU for
planned HD.

He had HD on [**12-7**], instead of [**12-8**] this week due to the
holiday.  Subsuquently he became more progressively dyspneic
starting on noon.  Patient reports his symptoms worsening at
dinner and especially become very orthopnic when he laid down.
He also reported chest tightness and wheezing.  His chest
tightness was diffuse, brought on with exertion at home, lasting
few minutes.  It was non radiating, he denies any arm
involvement, no lightheadedness, no nausea.  He did report
significant gasping for air with chest tightness.  The last time
it occured was in ED when he was moving around and the symptoms
were relieved with SLNTG.  It has not recurred since. Patient
also reported an episode of chills with T of 100.2 @ noon on
[**12-9**], that has not since recurred.  NO cough, no abdominal
pain, diarrhea x 3 days, once a day.  Minimal urine.  Also
reports increased LE swelling. Patient reports this is similar
to his prior volume overload episodes.

In ED, his VS were O2 Sats 91% RA, unable to talk in full
sentences. Given lasix 80 IV (no UO, due to HD) , nebs. K= 6.1,
given kayexalate. He also had brief episode of CP in ED,
resolved with SL nitro. Given ASA 325. No EKG changes. CXR with
overload. He was started on nitro paste with nitro gtt that
brought his BP to 160s.  He also had a RIJ placed in ED [**1-16**] to
difficult access.  Patient was hypertensive to 220s in AM still
on nitroglycerin gtt, and due to need for HD while on
nitroglycerin gtt was transfered to ICU.

[**2167-12-9**]: EKG - Sinus rhythm. Consider left ventricular
hypertrophy by voltage.  Prolonged QTc interval is non-specific

[**2167-12-10**]: chest xray - Pulmonary vascular engorgement and
perihilar haziness as well as fluffy opacities throughout the
lung fields are consistent with moderate CHF. Cardiomediastinal
silhouette is normal. There is no effusion or pneumothorax.

[**2167-12-10**]: TTE - The left atrium is normal in size. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular
cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size
and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
are mildly thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. No mitral regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary
artery systolic pressure could not be determined. There is no
pericardial effusion.


Brief Hospital Course:
In brief, the patient is a 59 year old man with hx of diastolic
CHF, DM2, HTN, Hep C, ESRD on HD, p/w shortness of breath likely
due to volume overload due to extra day without HD.

Acute on chronic diastolic CHF exacerbation: This was felt
likely due to extra day without HD due to holidays worsened by
hypertension. Patient denies any medication indescretion, likely
diet nonadherence. There was no evidence of cardiac ischemia.
There was no evidence of infection. His TTE was notable for
normal systolic function without significant valvular pathology.
He was dialysed without incident and was able to wean down on
his supplemental oxygen.  At the time of discharge he was
breathing comfortably on room air.

Chest pain: The patient had transient chest pain on admission
that resolved with control of his blood pressure and fluid
removal via ultrafiltration. As above, there was no sign of
acute cardiac ischemia. He continued on his home dose
metoprolol.

End-stage renal disease:  On HD T-Th-Sa hemodialysis via a left
arm AV graft.  He was dialyzed as above.  His phos-binder
regimen was increased.  His initial hyperkalemia was corrected
with kayexalate and dialysis. He will resume his regular
dialysis schedule upon discharge.

Diabetes mellitus: He continued on his home insulin regimen.

Diarrhea secondary to c. dif colitis: The patient had been
having loose stools ever since his last hospitalization.  A c
dif toxin was positive and he will complete a 10 day course of
metronidazole.

Depression: He continued his home dose of celexa.

Gout: There were no signs of acute flare and he continued on his
home dose of allopurinol.

FEN: - Diabetic low salt diet
Access: HD access via AV graft. had RIJ placed w/o complication
on admission, removed before discharge
Ppx: - SC heparin, PPI, bowel regimen
CODE: - Full
