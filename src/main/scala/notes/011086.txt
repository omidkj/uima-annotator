Lower Extremity Ulcers

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 84736**] is a 66 yo gentleman with CHF, DM, CKD III, HTN,
chronic AFIB, and PVD w/ extensive chronic lower extremity
ulcers. He was transferred from [**Hospital3 **] this evening for
further management of CHF and acute on chronic renal failure,
and possible debridement his heel ulcer.

He had been in rehab since a two-month hospitalization at [**Hospital1 18**]
([**Date range (1) 84737**]) for GBS bacterimia (presumed source, LE ulcers),
septic shock, & ATN requiring transient HD. Prior to that
hospitalization, he was fairly independent.

He was transferred from a rehabilitation center in [**Location (un) 5503**]
to [**Hospital3 **] on [**2-13**] for worsening dyspnea at rest. Reports
of his hospital course are limited, but it appears that he was
diuresed with an increased dose of lasix [40mg IV BID] with a
rise in Cr from 1.4 on admission to a peak of 2.5. His dry
weight is unknown, he states that he has never seen a
cardiologist & was unaware of a diagnosis of CHF until his
hospitalization here in [**Month (only) 359**]. Echo at [**Hospital1 **] notable for RV
dilation, severe pulmonary HTN, LVEF 35-40%. The net fluid
balance prior to transfer is unknown.

Currently, he states that he is mildly short of breath at rest
and has a 1 liter o2 requirement to maintain his sats in the low
90s--at baseline/rehab, he does not use o2. He denies chest
pain, denies a history of coronary dz or MI. Denies
fevers/chills. Denies pain in his legs/ulcers.

Initially, he was admitted to the vascular service & med consult
was called regarding his rhythm (which is at baseline, afib,
RBBB, LAFB, very frequent ventricular ectopy). Initial exam
revealed bibasilar rales and massive LE edema with pitting edema
extending to his upper abdomen. He was transferred to the
medical service on the night of arrival for further mgt;
vascular will follow regarding possible debridement.

Right ant/post tib artery.
-Prior DVT, details unclear
-hypothyroidism

Social History:
Patient lives with his wife in [**Name (NI) 3320**]. Owns a liquor store. He
smoked 4ppd x 40 years, quit 4 years ago. Per surgical admission
note, he drinks 1-3 drinks/day, ~5 days per week.

CXR ([**2177-2-19**]) - As compared to the previous radiograph, there is
unchanged moderate cardiomegaly. On today's radiograph, the
presence of a small left and right pleural effusion cannot be
excluded. The pre-existing slightly displaced right rib
fractures are still visible but appear healed. The minimal
widening of the right mediastinal aspect and the slight increase
in vascular diameters appear to suggest mild overhydration.
Minimal retrocardiac and right basal
atelectasis. No evidence of pneumonia.

TTE ([**2177-2-21**]) - The left atrium is mildly dilated. The right
atrium is moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is mildly
dilated. LV ejection fraction appears depressed (ejection
fraction 25%) with a significant contribution to the depressed
ejection fraction attributable to mechanical dyssynchrony. There
is considerable beat-to-beat variability of the left ventricular
ejection fraction due to an irregular rhythm/premature beats.
There is no ventricular septal defect. The right ventricular
free wall is hypertrophied. The right ventricular cavity is
dilated with depressed free wall contractility. The aortic valve
leaflets are moderately thickened. There is mild aortic valve
stenosis (valve area 1.2-1.9cm2). The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the
severity of mitral regurgitation may be significantly
UNDERestimated.] The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There
is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. The main
pulmonary artery is dilated. The branch pulmonary arteries are
dilated. There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed)
of [**2176-10-14**],the left ventricular ejection fraction is
further reduced.

TEE ([**2177-2-25**]) - No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen
in the body of the left atrium/left atrial appendage or the body
of the right atrium/right atrial appendage. Right atrial
appendage ejection velocity is good (>20 cm/s). No atrial septal
defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. There are simple atheroma
in the ascending aorta. There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the
aortic arch and the descending aorta. There are three moderately
thickened aortic valve leaflets. There is mild aortic valve
stenosis (valve area 1.2-1.9cm2). The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There
is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: No intracardiac thrombus seen. Depressed
biventricular systolic function. Mild mitral regurgitation. Mild
aortic stenosis. Complex aortic atheroma.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient had a long hospital course complicated by multiple
problems that are highlighted below.  Upon admission to [**Hospital1 18**] he
was volume overloaded with rhales and pitting edema.  Diuresis
was initiated with a lasix drip and metolazone, however, in the
setting of his baseline atrial fibrilation he continued to have
poor diuresis.  An echocardiogram showed worsening ejection
fraction from 40% to 25%.  He was started on amiodarone.  He
developed a pneumonia with respiratory failure and was
transferred to the CCU for intubation and pressors and was
started on broad spectrum antibiotics.  He was also found to
have a fungemia with [**Female First Name (un) **].  ID closely followed the patient.
