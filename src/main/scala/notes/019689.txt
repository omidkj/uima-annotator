Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2485**]
Chief Complaint:
86 yo male with PMH COPD, CAD (s/p STEMI [**6-23**]), GERD sent from
[**Hospital3 537**] w/ BRBPR x 6 days.  HCT decreased with bleeding.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
EGD on [**3-1**] showed normal stomach, normal duodenum and normal
prox. jejunum

History of Present Illness:
86 yo male with PMH COPD, CAD (s/p STEMI [**6-23**]), GERD sent from
[**Hospital3 537**] w/ BRBPR x 6 days. First BRP 6 days ago, felt
secondary to hemorrhoids. No blood again until last night when
he was noted to be oozing blood. Around 4am on [**2135-2-24**], noted to
be hypotensive with BP 80/40 and sent to [**Hospital1 18**] ED. Reported +SOB
+fatigue. Denied CP, LH/dizziness. No melena.

While in ED, initially hemodynamically stable (episode of
hypotension had resolved spontaneously), but then started to
have brisk BRBPR and decreased BP to 79/62. NG lavage negative.
CXR showed decreased lung volumes and a prominent R hilum. EKG
showed T wave flattening in V4-V6, NSR (CE's were negative after
cycle). CT of the abdomen showed thickening of the sigmoid colon
at the juntion of the descending colon, potentially c/w
diverticulitis (vs. mass).

The pt received 2L of IVF and 2U pRBCs. He was initially started
on levofloxacin and flagyl (rec'd 1d of course). Pt was seen by
GI who felt the bleed to be probably LGIB, with likely sources
being XRT proctitis or ischemia. Other LGIB sources included AVM
or diverticular bleed, given his clinical presentation. An UGIB
with rapid transit was considered as well, given the rise in BUN
and h/o stomach/intestinal resection. GI consult recommended
serial hcts, transfuse as needed, [**Hospital1 **] PPI, and tagged RBC scan
if actively bleeding. Plavix was held. The patient's daughter
expressed the pt's wishes to not have surgical intervention.

Brief Hospital Course:
86 yo male with PMH COPD, CAD (s/p STEMI [**6-23**]), GERD sent from
[**Hospital3 537**] w/ BRBPR x 6 days. First BRP 6 days ago, felt
secondary to hemorrhoids. No blood again until last night when
he was noted to be oozing blood. Around 4am on [**2135-2-24**], noted to
be hypotensive with BP 80/40 and sent to [**Hospital1 18**] ED. Reported +SOB
+fatigue. Denied CP, LH/dizziness. No melena.

While in ED, initially hemodynamically stable (episode of
hypotension had resolved spontaneously), but then started to
have brisk BRBPR and decreased BP to 79/62. NG lavage negative.
CXR showed decreased lung volumes and a prominent R hilum. EKG
showed T wave flattening in V4-V6, NSR (CE's were negative after
cycle). CT of the abdomen showed thickening of the sigmoid colon
at the juntion of the descending colon, potentially c/w
diverticulitis (vs. mass).

The pt received 2L of IVF and 2U pRBCs. He was initially started
on levofloxacin and flagyl (rec'd 1d of course). Pt was seen by
GI who felt the bleed to be probably LGIB, with likely sources
being XRT proctitis or ischemia. Other LGIB sources included AVM
or diverticular bleed, given his clinical presentation. An UGIB
with rapid transit was considered as well, given the rise in BUN
and h/o stomach/intestinal resection. GI consult recommended
serial hcts, transfuse as needed, [**Hospital1 **] PPI, and tagged RBC scan
if actively bleeding. Plavix was held. The patient's daughter
expressed the pt's wishes to not have surgical intervention.

The pt's first night in the ICU ([**2135-2-24**]), he was noted to become
agitated and was given haldol for worsening MS, felt to
secondary to hypercarbic respiratory failure from COPD flare
(7.22/68/110 on 3L NC). He was placed on combivent and flovent,
as well as stress dose steroids, for COPD flare, then on bipap.
He also had BRBPR but remained hemodynamically stable. He was
transfused an additional 2U pRBC on [**2135-2-25**], for a total of 4U
((hct 25.6 --> 30.3). Colonoscopy was postponed d/t worsening MS
and respiratory condition. The pt's Cr was noted to rise and
felt secondary to pre-renal and volume depletion (baseline 1.3 -
1.5).

On the evening of [**2135-2-25**], the patient had continued BRBPR (clots
only). Per report, patient's family desired no tagged RBC scan
or colonoscopy. The pt's diet was advanced to clears.  HCT fell
to 28.5.  Bipap was discontinued on [**2-26**] with improved
respiratory status.  On [**3-1**], pt had EGD with normal findings in
the stomach, duodenum and prox. jejunum.  On [**3-2**], HCT fell to
23.1 and the pt. received 4 units of PRBCs.  The patient then
refused further treatments in the form of: line placement, blood
products and the repeat bleeding scan recommended by GI.  The
patient remained hemodynamically stable for the next 2 days.

On [**3-4**]/5 (day of discharge), due to the patient's refusal of
further care, we met with his family and decided that it would
be best for him to return to [**Hospital3 537**] with an emphasis on
hospice/palliative care.  The patient, who had remained NPO
since admission, ate breakfast and tolerated food well.  He is
able to communicate well and deemed competent to make decisions
and persists that he wants to return home and does not want
further care in the hospital setting.  He will be transferred as
per his wishes this afternoon.
