Brief Hospital Course:
A and P/ 78 M with CAD who comes in with question of angina on
plavix, and acutely ASA and heparin gtt who subsequently
developed a GIB which was intervened on via EGD. Callout from
MICU to floor after 2 days in MICU.

1. GI Bleed: Eitiolgy likely related to ASA, plavix, and heparin
txt. Hct remained stable while on the floor. ASA, plavix, and
heparin were avoided. Pt able to advance to regualr diet with
out any problem.

2. CAD: Pt has fixed CAD lesion which unlikely to intereven on.
Given GIB, must consider consequences of further
anticoagulation. Unclear as to origin of CP. Official cardiology
EKG read as STEMI however after discussing this with Dr [**Name (NI) **], pt
cardiologist, this does not appear to be the case since pt has a
fixed lesion from a test few weeks prior. No further chest pain
or events on telemetry. Pt continued to be managed medically
with beta blocker and statin.

3. NSVT: PT had a few runs of NSVT while on telemetry prior to
the MICU. No further evetns since. Electrolytes remained normal.


4. Crohn's disease: PT maintained on azathiorpine, sulfasalzine,
cipro during this admisison.

5. Low grade fever: Pt has low grade fever, with a chest xray
without evidence of pneumonia and a urinalysis and culture which
were normal. Likely related to immobiltity while in hosptial and
atelectasis. Pt D/c with incentive spirometer.

6. CHF: Pt has a mild amount of CHF secondary to txfn in the
MICU with blood products. Pt diueresed well with additional 40
mg lasix x 1 with improving symptoms requiring no additional
oxygen.

Pt D/c in good condition after PT evaluation.
