status post tracheoplasty in [**6-1**]. However, he continues to have

Brief Hospital Course:
Pt admitted [**2108-12-10**] to [**Hospital Ward Name 121**] 2 for pleural effusion and
shortness of breath from outside hospital.

NEURO: Pt alert and oriented x3. Due to deteriorating pulmonary
status, pt was intubated on [**2108-12-11**], and was sedated throughout
his intubated time.

CV: Pt has history of hypercholesterolemia, managed on Lipitor.
Cycled enzymes during hypoxemic episodes, these were negative.
Pt has history of CAD, EKG was unchanged from prior.

PULM: Pt restored on home meds and nebulizers. Decided to wean
pt off steroids
for COPD as these were not felt to be helping him much.
Desaturatd down to 70s on HD1, and so was intubated and
transferred to ICU. Extubated on [**12-12**]. A swallow eval at that
time showed some aspiration of solid food, but with careful
instruction he was able to tolerate oral intake witout
aspiration. Despite this his oral intake was limited to avoid
complicating his clinical picture with the risk of re-aspirate.
Due to chronic inability to clear secretions, pt underwent
placement of tracheostomy tube by Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 952**] on [**12-19**]. This was
mainly to enhance pulmonary toilet, and decannulation is a
rehabilitation priority. Since placement of the tracheostomy pt
has had aggressive pulmonary toilet on the floor, including
frequent suctioning, and his pulmonary status has continued to
improve, with improving saturations on a gradually decreasing
oxygen requirement.

GI: As [**Hospital **] hospital course developed, it was felt likely that
GERD was contributing to his aspiration. A pH probe study showed
significant lower esophageal reflux, with [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] score of
47. Esophageal motility showed normal peristalsis, resting LES
of 10mm hg with normal relaxation. Esophageal manometry was of
poor quality and with unclear diagnosis. A nuclear medicine
gastric emptying scan was positive for significant delay of
gastric emptying, thus confirming that GERD likely has some role
in his aspiration problems. A [**Name2 (NI) **] fundoplication would be an
appropriate measure once the patient's status is further
optimized. Throughout his hospital course pt was maintained on
tubefeeds for nutrition. On [**12-24**], pt noted some abd discomfort
with tube feeds, and his rate was lowered to 65cc/hr, which
relieved the pain.

ID: Initially pt felt to be in sepsis arising from uncontrolled
pneumonia. Aggressive antibiotic therapy was initiated (Zosyn,
ceftaz, and imipenem at OSH), with good results. On discharge pt
is afebrile, and showing no signs of infection other than his
chronic high-output respiratory secretions, which are not
believed to be of infectious etiology.
