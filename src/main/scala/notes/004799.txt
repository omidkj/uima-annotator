Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2181**]
Chief Complaint:
Fever, tachycardia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 58 year old male with a recent admission for
abdominal pain s/p negative exploratory laparotomy for suspected
intussuception now returns on day of discharge with fever and
tachycardia. Patient has a history for terrible vasculopathy s/p
recent right BKA with dry gangrene of the distal stump.
Patient's last admission was significant for a negative ex-lap.
Post-operatively, his course was complicated by respiratory
distress necessitating an urgent return to the ICU and was
intubated. After multuple failed attempts at extubation, the
patient was trached. Patient then did well on a trach mask and
was transferred to rehab on the day of admission but now returns
with tachycardia to the 120's, and fever to 102 degrees F.

Pertinent Results:
MRI HEAD: The diffusion images demonstrate no evidence of slow
diffusion to indicate acute infarct. There is moderate
prominence of ventricles and sulci, inappropriate for the
patient's age. There is no midline shift, mass effect,
hydrocephalus, or territorial infarct. Following gadolinium, no
evidence of abnormal parenchymal, [**Month/Year (2) 1106**], or meningeal
enhancement seen.

Gastric biopsy: negative for H. pylori.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was re-admitted to the surgical service and taken to
the SICU. A chest x-ray on admission showed effusions consistent
with CHF along with overlying pnumonia. Urine cultures were
significant for Klebsiella UTI and sputum cultures were
significant for MRSA. He was placed on vancomycin, levofloxacin
and fluconazole. He underwent PICC line placement on [**4-11**]. A
trach collar was placed on [**4-12**]. GI was consulted for
colonoscopy. Patient was transferred to the floor on [**4-13**]. He was
seen by respiratory therapy and suctioned continually throughout
his hospital course. His respiratory status improved. He
tolerated his trach collar, and tube feeds at goal. The
fluconazole was discontinued. On [**4-14**] the patient was seen by
physical therapy. A nutrition consult was obtained on [**4-15**]. He
underwent a failed bedside swallow study. Based on a chest x-ray
that showed a small hydro-pneumothorax on the left lower lobe of
the lung, a thoracic surgery consult was obtained, though no
specific interventions were warranted at the time. On [**4-16**] the
patient's tube feed were changed from Respalor to Deliver 2.0 to
give increased calories. On [**4-18**], urine cultures grew out VRE,
and a C diff was negative. He experienced low grade fevers. He
was pan-cultured on [**4-19**] for continued fevers. On [**4-20**], his
nutrition regimen was changed to Deliver 2.0 at 70cc/hr with 15g
ProMod. On [**4-21**], the patient experienced PVC's. An EKG showed ST
segment depression along the lateral pre-cordial leads. Serial
enzymes showed mild elevation of troponins. A cardiology consult
was obtained. The cardiology service simply recommended
increasing the beta-blockade and maximizing the patient's
electrolyte status. On [**4-22**], the patient was transferred to the
medical service.
.
Pt's vancomycin was stopped after 14 days of treatment.  HIV
test was found to be negative.  MRI head was obtained to further
w/u patient's apparent cognitive decline.  MRI showed prominent
sulci and enlarged ventricles abnormal for the patient's age.
Due to concerns for dementia, neurology consult was obtained.
Neurology felt that the patient's cognitive symptoms were
consistent w/ metabolic encephalopathy due to his multiple
medical problems.  They felt that his mental status would
improve as his health improved.  Underlying dementia was
possible but difficult to assess with an overlying delerium.
The patient continued to pull out his doboff tube.  Pt had EGD
performed to evaluate his poor nutritional status.  He was found
to have a large gastric ulcer and high dose PPI was started.
The gastric biopsy and the serology were both negative for H.
pylori.  PEG placement was unsuccessful by GI due to the
patient's anantomy.  [**4-28**] the patient had a J tube placed in
interventional radiology for nutritional support.  He was
re-started on tube feeds.  [**4-29**] patient failed a repeat swallow
evaluation due to discoordinated swallow.  [**4-30**] the patient was
taken for colonoscopy and found to have a normal colon to cecum.
 [**5-5**] the patient was found to be C diff positive and was
started on 14 day course of Flagyl.  On [**5-11**], as his mental
status improved, he did well at the bed side swall evaluation.
On [**5-12**], he underwent video swallow evaluation and was able to
tolerate ground consistent food and thin liquids.  His meds
should be crushed and mixed with puree thick liquid.  He has
gained 30 lb since the tubefeed was initiated (70 lb to 100 lb)
during this admission.  He will still need to be on tubefeed to
support his nutrition until he is cleared by a nutritionist.  In
terms of his mental status, he continued to improve steadily
over the last few weeks of his hospital stay.  He was more alert
and engaged with activity.  He did much better with PT and OT at
the end after his mental status improved.  As noted above, his
mental status change was likely toxic-metabolic from acute
infection.

He started to develop more pain around the right stump since
[**5-10**].  He was seen by the [**Month/Year (2) 1106**] surgery who felt that he is
too medically sick and malnourished to have surgery at this
time.  He will follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3407**] as outpatient.
Initially, his pain was controlled with titrating up the
Oxycontin.  However, it was titrated too quickly from 10 mg [**Hospital1 **]
to 30 mg [**Hospital1 **].  He then developed urinary retention requiring
foley placement.  After he passed the video swallowing, he was
tolerating ground consistent solids.  On [**5-17**], he had an emesis x
1, and had aspiration pneumonia (+interstital markings on the
left on CXR, fever, leukocytosis).  His Flagyl course was
extended, and Vanc/Levo were added.  His sputum showed many GPC
which later grew Staph aureus.  Given his recent MRSA pneumonia,
he will be treated with 2 week course of Vanc/Levo/Flagyl.  He
was seen by the pain service who recommended to discontinue
Oxycontin, and start Neurontin, MSIR, and lidocaine patch in
addition to the standing Tylenol.  On [**5-18**], his J-tube was noted
to be obstructed but was able to be flushed by IR on [**5-19**].
Tubefeed was resumed without any difficulty since.  Since
oxycontin was discontinued, the foley was removed on [**5-20**] and was
able to void without any difficulty.
