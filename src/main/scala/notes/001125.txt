CHEST RADIOGRAPH
INDICATION: Followup.
COMPARISON: [**2185-2-2**].
FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, the
nasogastric tube and the endotracheal tube have been removed.
Both lungs have increased in transparency, however the
pre-existing bilateral extensive parenchymal opacities are still
very prominent. No evidence of pleural effusion. The size of the
cardiac silhouette is unchanged.
