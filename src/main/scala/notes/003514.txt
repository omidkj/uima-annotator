Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 134**]
Chief Complaint:
Acute Coronary Syndrome with V-Fib Arrest


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac Catheterization with placement of Bare Metal Stents to
the Right Coronary Artery - [**2188-12-24**]


History of Present Illness:
**History obtained from medical record/pt's wife

51-year-old man with a past medical history of hypertension and
hyperlipidemia who was brought by EMS to the ED at [**Hospital1 **] on
the evening prior to admission with VFib arrest. He complained
of  feeling "poorly" all day on the day prior to admission, with
back pain, nausea, and profound weakness (though he did go
towork).  He took tylenol with codeine for back pain and Tums
for symptoms of indigestion.  He went to bed at midnight.  As
soon as his wife shut the lights off, she felt him shaking,
turned on the lights and he was "having a seizure" and did not
respond to her.  911 was called; EMS arrived within 5 minutes.
Found the patient nonresponsive. Placed AED-->V-Fib arrest-->
defibrillated him x 1.  He developed sinus brady, transient Afib
and then sinus tach. Lidocaine gtt started. SBP low at 80,
dopamine gtt started. Unable to intubate, bagged him
successfully. Given narcan due to pinpoint pupils with no
response. He was transported to [**Hospital1 **].
.
OSH COURSE: GCS on arrival to ED= 5.  He was intubated, NGT and
foley placed. Head CT negative for bleed, chest CT negative for
PE.  His cardiac enzymes were positive (trop 712, CPK 466, MBI
6.5, ALT 271, ALT 195, ABG: 7.37/36/231). Initial EKG with Afib
at 98, Lateral ST depressions, inferior Q waves; then converted
to sinus rhythm 117, lateral ST depression, inferior Q waves.
BP increased to 210/140, dopamine and lidocaine discontinued.
Given NS 1.5L, ASA 325, Plavix 300, heparin and integrillin
gtts, metoprolol 5 mg IV, Ativan 2 mg.
Admitted to OSH ICU overnight. Cardiac cath performed on the day
of transfer; found to have 100% occluded RCA with collaterals,
Left Main: 20% at ostium, LAD: clean, D1 50% ostial stenosis,
LCx: 30% stenosis. V gram: EF 40%, inferior wall hypo/akinesis,
normal mitral valve, normal aortic root. Started on integrillin,
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for revascularization. Vitals at OSH: HR in
60's afebrile, SBP 9o's.

Cath: [**12-24**]
1.  Limited coronary angiography demonstrated single (1) vessel
coronary
artery disease.  The right coronary artery demonstrated a
totally
occluded proximal RCA with a large thrombus burden.  The left
system was
not engaged - outside hospital angiography demonstrated no
severe
stenosis with the distal left supplying collaterals to the
right.
2.  Successful thrombectomy, PTCA and stenting of the proximal -
mid RCA
with a Vision (3x28mm) bare metal stent postdilated with a 4.0
mm
balloon in the proximal portion of the stent.  Final angiography

demonstrated no angiographically apparent dissection, no
residual
stenosis and TIMI III flow (see PTCA comments).

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. One vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Acute inferior myocardial infarction, managed by
thrombectomy, PTCA
and stenting of the proximal-mid RCA with a bare metal stent.
.
TTE [**12-25**]:
The left atrium is normal in size. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is mild
regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with inferior
akinesis and basal inferolateral hypokinesis. The remaining
segments contract normally (LVEF = 45%). Tissue Doppler imaging
suggests a normal left ventricular filling pressure
(PCWP<12mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic
regurgitation. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with
trivial mitral regurgitation. There is no mitral valve prolapse.
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction,
c/w CAD.

Brief Hospital Course:
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN
Pt. is a 51y.o. M with a PMH of HTN and hyperlipidemia
transferred from OSH after VFib arrest and diagnostic cath
demonstrated TO of RCA.
.
# CAD/Ischemia: Pt presented with late sx of ischemia after
suffering Vfib arrest at home. Per records EMS defibrillated
w/in 5minutes of call. Diagnostic cath at OSH demonstrated no
stenosis of LAD, 50% ostial D1, mild stenosis of mid LCx and
prox occlusion of RCA. LVgram EF 40%. Pt underwent PCI upon
transfer with BMS to RCA. Pt HD stable. Peak CK 1700. Patient
was maintained on aspirin, plavix, metoprolol, high-dose statin,
and lisinopril 10mg daily, and was discharged on these
medications.
.
# Pump: LV gram as OSH demonstrated EF of 40%. ECHO showed EF of
45% with akinesis of inferior wall and no RV involvement.
Patient to be continued on metoprolol and lisinopril as an
outpatient, and should also have an echocardiogram done within 2
months time to assess his heart function.
.
# Rhythm: Pt currently NSR. History of Vfib arrest, most likely
secondary to ischemic event. His QT-interval have been monitored
on morning ECGs and are not concerning. He was monitored on
telemetry while hospitalized and did not have any further
arrhythmias.
.
# Altered Mental Status - Pt was bagged in the field by EMS and
intubated on arrival at OSH. Per records, the Pt was
resuscitated quickly following arrest. Unclear length of time
the patient was anoxic. Per report CT head negative for evidence
of CVA. Patient has been improving since extubation. Per
behavioral neurology consult, this is likely anoxic brain
injury, and will improve with time, no need for MRI at this
time. Will need outpatient rehabilitation. Psy
