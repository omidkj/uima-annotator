Chief Complaint:
Hospital transfer- originally admitted to [**Hospital1 2177**] for "heartburn".

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac catheterization on [**2115-5-28**] with stenting of the left
circumflex artery.

History of Present Illness:
79 yo F c h/o CAD s/p stent placement in [**2111**] originally
presented to OSH c/o epigastric pain which pt. originally
attributed to "heart burn".  The pain, however, was not relieved
by antacids as usual.  The pt. denied chest pain, SOB, N/V,
diaphoresis. Pt. was taken to [**Hospital1 2177**] where it was discovered that
she had ST elevations in V1-V3 and reciprocal depressions in II,
III, and aVF.  She was taken to the cath lab and found to have
total occlusion of proximal LAD. Pt. had instant relief of pain
following stenting of this vessel.  Subsequent serial
echocardiograms showed declining LVEF from 40 to 30 to 20% c
severe akinesis of apex. During her hospital course, pt.
developed dyspnea and wheezing which was felt to be cardiac in
etiology.  She responded well to diuresis.  She was transferred
to [**Hospital1 18**] for further care.

Brief Hospital Course:
The pt. was admitted to the cardiac medicine service and placed
on telemetry.  For the first five days of her hospital stay, the
goal was diuresis to improve her respiratory symptoms which were
thought to be due in part to congestive heart failure and
subsequent pulmonary edema superimposed on pre-existing COPD. On
the first hospital day, the pt. was placed on a nesiritide drip
and IV lasix.  When it was noted that her blood pressure dropped
signigificantly over the course of 24 hours, nesiritide was
discontinued on the second hospital day.  She was therefore
maintained only on IV lasix for diuresis.  She responded
minimally to diuretic therapy, maintaining a marginally negative
fluid balance and showing slight improvement in LE edema and
pulmonary symptoms.  On the sixth hospital day, the pt. was
scheduled to undergo cardiac catheterization. Prior to the
procedure, she developed significant respiratory distress while
attempting to remain supine for the procedure.  Thus the the pt.
was given nebulizer treatments and the procedure was cancelled.
While in the holding area, however, the pt. was noted to respond
well to the nebulizer treatments, and the catheterization was
undertaken. The end result of the procedure was PTCA/stenting of
her left circumflex artery.  As the pt. experienced significant
respiratory symptoms and a transient drop in blood pressure near
the time of the procedure, she was brought to the CCU after the
procedure where she remained for one day.  Her brief stay in the
CCU was uneventful. She was judged to be in stable condition on
the seventh hospital day and was transferred back to the floor.
She remained on telemetry for the next two hospital days without
incident. She was discharged to a rehab facility in stable
condition.
