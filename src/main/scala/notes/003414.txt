Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2736**]
Chief Complaint:
shortness of breath and hypertension

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **]-year-old female with past medical history of hypertension,
dyslipidemia, dementia presents with acute onset shortness of
breath.
.
The patient was in her usual state of health until a few months
ago when the patient developed difficult to control hypertension
with SBPs ranging from 150-180s. The patient was recently
diagnosed with bronchitis and was treated with azithromycin. Her
last dose was yesterday. The patient continued to feel unwell so
went to PCP for appointment. At that appointment PCP felt that
lungs sounded clear and sent patient home. Blood pressure at
that visit was noted to be 180/70.
.
Later that evening, the patient awoke with shortness of breath,
wheezing and difficulty sleeping. In the AM the patient felt
unwell with fatigue, decreased PO intake and emesis x1. Later in
the day she again became short of breath, flushed and
diaphoretic. An ambulance was called. At that time blood
pressure was checked and noted to be elevated with systolic
pressures of 160s. She was given nitroglycerin paste with some
improvement of breathing. She denies chest pain, arm or back
pain, fever or chills. She denies ankle edema, orthopnea,
dyspnea on exertion or weight gain. She uses a walker to
ambulate at baseline. She is compliant with medications and
notes recent poor PO intake. The patient was brought to [**Hospital1 18**] EW
for further evaluation.
.
In the EW, initial vitals were: T 97.9, HR 64, BP 218/76, RR 22,
SaO2 98% on 2L NC. CXR showed moderate pulmonary edema with L>R
pleural effusions. She was given atenolol 25mg PO, metoprolol
5mg IV, ASA 325mg, Nitro paste, 1 SL nitro, Lasix 40mg IV, and
started on a nitro gtt. Her BP remained elevated with SBP 190s
in the R arm and 160s in the L arm (has had 20-30 point
difference in past based on PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 12883**]). Initial labs were
notable for BNP >30,000 and trop 0.03.
.
On arrival to the floor, patient is comfortable and denies any
pain.

.

[**2181-3-12**] TTE: The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial septal
defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is mild symmetric
left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and
regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). There is no
ventricular septal defect. with normal free wall contractility.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is a
minimally increased gradient consistent with minimal aortic
valve stenosis. Mild to moderate ([**2-4**]+) aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is
no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The
pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2176-2-28**],
LVH is now present.
.
[**2181-3-12**] CT Head: 1. No acute intracranial hemorrhage. 2.
Prominent ventricles, which appear to have gradually increased
in size since [**2176-2-4**] exam. MRI exam may be considered for
further evaluation. 3. Small vessel ischemic disease.

.
[**2181-3-15**] MRA neck/brain:
FINDINGS: The neck MRA demonstrates normal appearance of the
right vertebral artery with mild atherosclerotic disease at the
origin of both carotid arteries. The left vertebral artery is
only visualized in the distal V4 portion on the post-gadolinium
arterial phase images. There is high-grade stenosis of the
proximal left subclavian artery identified. Mild narrowing
and/or stenosis of the origin of the left common carotid is seen
from the aortic arch. The venous phase of the
gadolinium-enhanced MRA demonstrates visualization of the left
vertebral artery in its lower portion. These findings are
indicative of subclavian steal phenomenon with retrograde flow
in the left vertebral artery due to high-grade subclavian
stenosis.
IMPRESSION:
High-grade left subclavian stenosis with retrograde flow in the
left vertebral artery indicating subclavian steal phenomenon.
Mild atherosclerotic disease at other levels as described above.

MRA HEAD:
The head MRA demonstrates irregularity of the flow signal in
both middle
cerebral arteries due to atherosclerotic disease. The left
distal vertebral artery is not visualized given the retrograde
nature of the flow and inferior saturation pulse used for MRA.
The right posterior cerebral artery is somewhat irregular in
appearance due to atherosclerotic disease.
IMPRESSION:
Head MRA shows nonvisualization of the left vertebral artery due
to retrograde flow in
