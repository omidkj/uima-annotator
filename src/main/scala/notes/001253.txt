HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 75-year-old man
with a history of CHF (EF 30-40% as of [**2193-6-2**]), CAD, status
post inferior MI in [**2183**], hypertension, dyslipidemia, COPD,
insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, and chronic renal failure
presenting with bilateral purple color changes and edema of his
lower extremities present since the end of [**Month (only) 205**].  The history was
obtained through his wife as the patient only speaks [**Name (NI) 8230**].
Since the end of [**Month (only) 205**], his legs have been purple colored,
swollen, and tender to the touch, left greater than right.  His
wife reports that he has been on multiple antibiotics for
presumed cellulitis starting with amoxicillin 500 mg b.i.d. from
[**2193-8-15**] to [**2193-8-21**] followed by Zithromax 500 mg starting
[**2193-8-21**] followed by 250 mg p.o. q.d. on [**2193-8-22**] through
[**2193-8-26**].  However, per the medical records these antibiotics
were actually for bronchitis.

On [**2193-9-10**], he visited Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **], a cardiologist, who was
concerned about possible cellulitis and he was started on
cephalexin 500 mg t.i.d.  There was concern that the edema and
erythema could be due to a DVT, but on [**2193-9-12**], Mr.
[**Known lastname **] had venous duplexes negative for lower extremity DVT
bilaterally.  His wife states that the discoloration is neither
improving nor worsening.  She states that he feels "okay",
although has complained of decreased appetite.  She also states
that he had long-standing lower extremity edema bilaterally as
well as numbness bilaterally. He also complains of orthopnea
(sleeps in a Lazy Boy chair) and PND.

3.  CAD, status post anterior MI in [**2183**].
4.  Chronic renal failure with a baseline creatinine of 2.4.

ALLERGIES: The patient reports an allergy to Levaquin which
is manifested by a severe headache.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  The patient reports increased fatigue,
weakness, no fevers, chills, or night sweats.  No shortness
of breath, a productive cough of light yellow sputum, history
of hypertension, orthopnea, PND, lower leg extremity,
however, currently denied chest pain, denied nausea,
vomiting, diarrhea, bright red blood per rectum, melena, or
abdominal pain.  The patient does report urinary hesitancy,
no dysuria, however.  Does report urinary dribbling.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  General:  Appears stated
age, resting comfortably in bed, in no apparent distress.
Vital signs:  Temperature 98.6, blood pressure 155/71, pulse
70, respiratory rate 22, 97% on room air.  HEENT:  The pupils
were asymmetric, not round; oropharynx clear without exudate;
no lymphadenopathy.  Lungs:  Crackles two-thirds of the way
up on the left, one-half of the way up on the right; some
decreased crackles with cough.  Cardiovascular:  Regular rate
and rhythm.  No murmurs, rubs, or gallops.  Laterally
displaced PMI; JVD not elevated.  Abdomen:  Positive bowel
sounds, soft, nontender, distended, no hepatosplenomegaly.
Vascular:  2+ femoral and popliteal pulses bilaterally,
unable to assess DP and PT pulses secondary to bilateral
edema of lower legs.  Skin:  Purple colored area on both
lower extremities two-thirds of the way up of the calf on the
left, half way up the calf on the right; scaling skin over
areas of color.  Neurologic:  The pupils were asymmetric and
not round.  The extraocular movements were intact.  No facial
droop.  Facial movements were symmetric.

LABORATORY/RADIOLOGIC DATA:  On admission, the patient had a
BUN of 47, creatinine 2.0, glucose 130.  White blood cell
count 9.7, hematocrit 38.4, platelets 142,000.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  1.  CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE:  The patient
is status post MI in [**2183**].  An echocardiogram in [**2193-6-2**]
showed an EF of 30-40%, down from 45% in [**2193-5-2**].  When
the patient was admitted, he was taking a beta blocker, a statin,
and [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) **].  Repeat echocardiogram on [**2193-9-24**],
hospital day number two, showed a moderate regional left
ventricular systolic dysfunction with an ejection fraction of
30-40% as well as severe hypokinesis of the inferior septum,
inferior wall, inferolateral walls.  There was 1+ MR, AR, and TR
were noted.  Compared to the study of [**2193-6-5**], there have been
no significant changes.

To optimize medical management, his dose of Valsartan was
increased to 150 mg p.o. q.d.  He was started on an aspirin 325
mg p.o. q.d.  Cardiology was consulted.  On hospital day number
three ([**2193-9-25**]), the patient had a Persantine MIBI showing a
moderate sized reversible defect involving the lateral wall.
There was a severe fixed defect involving the base of the
inferior wall.  There was global hypokinesia with an EF of 41%.
It was determined that the patient needed a cardiac
catheterization which was planned for hospital day number five
([**2193-9-27**]) but was postponed due to an INR of 2.1.  The
catheterization was then rescheduled for hospital day number
eight ([**2193-9-30**]) but due to creatinine elevation to 2.9 as well
as the patient developing pneumonia, it was decided that the
patient would go home and follow-up with his cardiologist to
schedule a catheterization as an outpatient.

Due to the increased creatinine, the Valsartan was discontinued
on [**2193-9-29**] through [**2193-10-3**], at which point his
creatinine had normalized so the Valsartan was restarted at a
lower dose.  However, the creatinine increased again.  The
Valsartan was discontinued.

On hospital day number 12 ([**2193-10-4**]), he became
hypotensive to 70/palpable which was likely secondary to
dehydration.  He was transferred to the MICU in the early morning
of [**2193-10-5**] (hospital day number 13) where he responded to
rehydration with normal saline.  The MICU cardiac enzymes were
elevated, likely reflecting an acute MI. He was returned to the
floor on [**2193-10-7**].

2.  ATRIAL FIBRILLATION:  The patient has a history of paroxysmal
atrial fibrillation; however, during his hospitalization, the
patient was in sinus rhythm.  The patient arrived on Coumadin,
was switched at one point to heparin in order to have the cardiac
catheterization, but once it was determined that he would not
have catheterization on this admission, he was
