valve stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Mild to moderate ([**1-15**]+)mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is
no pericardial effusion. ? Mildly decreased EF from previous
echo.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the OMED service for further
treatment and work-up. Based off of the pt's history, clinical
exam, BNP > 50,000, and admission CXR suggestive of fluid
overload, it was thought that the etiology of the pt's SOB was
secondary to a diastolic CHF exacerbation. He had been
previously admitted to the hospital just 4 days PTA with similar
complaints of SOB that was also associated with a cough, and was
diuresed and treated with antibiotics for a community acquired
pneumonia. However, he was not discharged on standing po lasix.
On arrival to the floor, his BP was noted to be elevated in the
170-180s/90s. He was started on IV lasix for diuresis and
standing po lasix. His blood pressure medication regimen was
further titrated up with good effect and he was started on
norvasc on top of an ACE-I and b-blocker. As he had just been
admitted the week prior and had a TTE, another TTE was not
checked. He was ruled out for ACS with 3 sets of negative
cardiac enyzmes. The pt had just completed a 7 day course of abx
for treatment of CAP prior to admission and given his lack of
clinical symptoms suggestive of PNA, including fever and cough,
he was not continued to antibiotics.
.
Over the hospital course, he was diuresed a total of 4.5 - 5 L
and his weight was noted to drop 4-5 lbs.  An attempt was made
to contact his cardiologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], during his
hospitalization however Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was on vacation. Thus, the
cardiology service was consulted who agreed with the team's
assessment that the pt's diastolic HF was likely [**2-15**] HTN and
exacerbated by poorly controlled BPs at home along with his
known [**1-15**]+ MR. The patient was discharged in good condition and
has a follow-up appointment with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] within 1 weeks time
to check his blood pressure, obtain an outpatient stress echo
test, and further titrate his medications.

Medications on Admission:
1. Sucralfate 1 g QID
2. Hydroxyurea 500 mg PO HS
3. Pantoprazole 40 [**Hospital1 **]
4. Allopurinol 300
