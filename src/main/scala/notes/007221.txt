HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This 76-year-old white male
presented to his doctor prior to initiating an exercise
program.  He was noted to have an abnormal EKG and was
referred for an exercise tolerance test which was stopped due
to the patient's fatigue.  Imaging revealed an EF of 37
percent, moderate reversible inferior defect, and an
echocardiogram showed a dilated RA and LA with an EF of 45-50
percent.  He was referred for cardiac catheterization which
he underwent on [**2150-5-5**] at [**Hospital1 188**] which revealed an EF of 50 percent, normal left main,
90 percent RCA stenosis, 90 percent proximal LAD stenosis, 90
percent distal LAD stenosis, 90 percent diagonal I stenosis,
and 100 percent OM1 stenosis.  He is now admitted for cardiac
catheterization.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. History of hypertension.
2. History of insulin-dependent diabetes for 50 years.
3. History of hypercholesterolemia.
4. History of obesity.
5. History of first-degree AV block with occasional second-
   degree type I.
6. History of BPH.
7. History of bulbar urethral stricture.
8. Status post bilateral cataract surgery.
9. Status post laser eye surgery.
10.      Status post ERCP.
11.      Status post cholecystectomy.
12.      Status post left rib fractures times two.


ADMISSION MEDICATIONS:
1. Insulin 70/30 66 units q.a.m., 10 units q.p.m. if blood
   sugar is greater than 280.
2. Hydrochlorothiazide 50 mg p.o. q.d.
3. Glucophage 500 mg p.o. b.i.d.
4. Lisinopril 10 mg p.o. q.d.

7. Lipitor 10 mg p.o. q.d.
8. Aspirin 1 p.o. q.d.
9. Multivitamin one p.o. q.d.


SOCIAL HISTORY:  He is married and lives with his wife.  [**Name (NI) **]
does not smoke cigarettes.  He does not drink alcohol.

ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Significant for bilateral pedal edema,
pain in the back of his calf and feet with routine
ambulation, dizziness when standing.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  General:  The patient is an elderly
white male in no apparent distress.  Vital signs:  Pulse 75
with first-degree AV block and frequent PACs and PVCs.  Blood
pressure 154/195, respiratory rate 10.  HEENT:  Normocephalic
and atraumatic.  The extraocular movements were intact.  The
oropharynx was benign.  Neck:  Supple, full range of motion.
No lymphadenopathy or thyromegaly.  Carotids were 2+ and
equal bilaterally without bruits.  Lungs:  Clear to
auscultation and percussion.  Cardiovascular:
Irregularly/irregular distant rate and rhythm with distant
heart sounds.  Abdomen:  Obese, soft, nontender, with
positive bowel sounds.  Well healed midline surgical scar.
No masses or hepatosplenomegaly, nontender.  Extremities:
Bilateral lower extremity 2+ pitting edema.  No clubbing or
cyanosis.  The pulses were 1+ and equal bilaterally
throughout with the exception of 2+ radials and [**Name (NI) **]
PTs and DPs.  Neurologic:  Nonfocal.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  On [**2150-5-11**], the patient underwent a CABG
times four with saphenous vein grafts to the diagonal, LAD,
OM and PDA.  The cross clamp time was 63 minutes, total
bypass time 106 minutes.  He was transferred to the CSRU on
Neo-Synephrine and propofol.  He was extubated on his
postoperative night.  On postoperative day number one, he was
transfused 1 unit of cells.  On postoperative day number two,
he went into atrial fibrillation and was started on
Amiodarone.  He then later had a low cardiac index and was
started on dobutamine and his chest tubes were discontinued
on postoperative day number two.  He received another unit of
blood on postoperative day number three and was started on
heparinization for atrial fibrillation.  His dobutamine was
discontinued on postoperative day number four.  He required
aggressive respiratory therapy, diuresis, and physical
therapy.

He was transferred to the floor on postoperative day number
seven.  He continued to require aggressive rehabilitation.
We also obtained a renal consult as his creatinine went up to
2, but this eventually resolved.  He was slowly progressing
and on postoperative day number nine, he experienced an
asystolic arrest, was intubated, transferred back to the
unit, had his Amiodarone and Lopressor discontinued and had a
temporary wire placed.  He intermittently had some left lower
lobe collapse, had to be bronchoscoped, required aggressive
respiratory therapy.  He also was on dopamine for his renal
issues.  He was treated with a ten day course of
levofloxacin.  He was followed by EP and was to have a
permanent pacemaker but his white count was elevated so they
had to wait for this to resolve.  He was extubated.  On
[**2150-6-1**], postoperative day number 21, he had a permanent
pacer placed successfully.

On postoperative day number 22, he was transferred back to
the floor and anticoagulated with heparin and Coumadin.  He
continued to progress.  On postoperative day number 26, he
was discharged to rehabilitation in stable condition.

26.6, platelets 250,000.  Sodium 144, potassium 5.1, chloride
108, C02 27, BUN 33, creatinine 1.5, blood sugar 118.
