Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2763**]
Chief Complaint:
Fever, sepsis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Central Line, Intubation

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Name13 (STitle) 24943**] is an 89 yo F iwth h/o recent surgical AVR ([**2141-3-20**])
for critical AS, CAD, PAfib, h/o GI bleed, s/p prolonged
hospital stay c/b BL pleural effusions requiring thoracentesis
(discharged [**2141-5-9**]), who now returns with worsening respiratory
distress, [**Last Name (un) **] and fever. At [**Hospital 100**] Rehab, clinical status was
worsening: she became delirious and desatted to 58%. She was
started on nonrebreather, cultures were drawn, and she was
transported to [**Hospital1 18**] ED. Currently on BiPAP.
.
In the ED, initial VS were T 101.0, P 120, BP 126/76, R 26, Sat
98% 15L.  WBC count was 20.3K with 85% PMNs and 3% bands.
Lactate was 2.2.  Creatinine was 1.9 (baseline 1.3), BUN was
149.  Anion gap was 18.  Urinalysis showed >182 WBCs, many
bacteria, no epis.  INR was 1.1.  Chest X-ray was performed and
showed small bilateral effusions and bibasilar opacities, likely
atelectasis but infection cannot be excluded.  Patient was given
vancomycin 1 g IV x 1. Cefepime and Azithromycin were ordered
but patient never received them in ED. She received
acetaminophen 1 g x 1 for her fever.  Patient has one peripheral
IV x 1, and PICC line likely placed during previous
hospitalization. She has a foley in place from 3 days ago
([**5-20**]).  Vitals 117/70, HR 110, afebrile.

On arrival to the MICU, vitals are BP 105/49 HR 99 RR 30 SaO2
100% CPAP.  Bedside echo showed normal LV function, no
pericardial effusion, hypokinetic RV, and likely unchanged
valvular function.

Past Medical History:

Radiology:
.
TTE [**5-23**]:
aortic valve prosthesis is present. No aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild to
moderate ([**12-26**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic
shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may be
significantly UNDERestimated.] The tricuspid valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. [In
the setting of at least moderate to severe tricuspid
regurgitation, the estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure
may be underestimated due to a very high right atrial pressure.]

IMPRESSION: Suboptimal images. Mild symmetric LVH with
near-hyperdynamic LV systolic function. The right ventricle is
not well seen. AVR without significant regurgitation. At least
mild to moderate mitral regurgitation. Moderate tricuspid
regurgitation with moderate pulmonary hypertension.
.
Admission CXR:
IMPRESSION:  Slight interval improvement in mild pulmonary
vascular
congestion, small bilateral pleural effusions, and bibasilar
airspace
opacities likely reflecting atelectasis.  Please note that
infection at the lung bases cannot be completely excluded.
.
Renal U/S:
IMPRESSION:
No hydronephrosis and no perinephric fluid collection
identified.  Small
simple right renal cyst.
.
BLE Venous Duplex:
IMPRESSION: No deep vein thrombosis in either leg.

Brief Hospital Course:
Assessment and Plan:
Ms. [**Name13 (STitle) 24943**] is an 89 yo F iwth h/o recent surgical AVR ([**2141-3-20**])
for critical AS, CAD, PAfib, h/o GI bleed, s/p prolonged
hospital stay c/b BL pleural effusions requiring thoracentesis
(discharged [**2141-5-9**]), who now returns with worsening respiratory
distress, [**Last Name (un) **] and fever, with likely UTI.
.
# Complicated UTI
Patient with recent UTI from previous hospitalization growing
pseudomonas and [**Last Name (un) **] s/p course of cefepime, unclear if treated
for [**Name (NI) **]. U/A in ED with significant Pyuria. She has foley, which
per rehab was placed on [**5-20**]. Patient started empirically on
cefepime and vancomycin.
-f/u urine culture from ED
- replace foley ([**2141-5-23**])
- f/u repeat u/a and culture after replacing foley.
- f/u blood cultures
- evaluate for complications w/ renal ultrasound
- treat with cefepime and linezolid until further culture data
.
# HYPOXIA
Likely multifactorial etiology. Initially intubated for
increased work of breathing, concern she was tiring. Has been
repeatedly failing SBTs since then, likely [**1-26**] pulmonary edema,
respiratory muscle weakness (due to poor nutrition and
deconditioning).  Pt receiving lasix diuresis and nutrition with
no improvement. After extensive discussion with family about
poor long-term prognosis and anticipated difficulty reversing
the processes keeping her on vent, family decided that they
would transition to [**Month/Day (2) 3225**] today.
-Have DC??????d Lasix gtt
- Pt on CMV for now, may transition to PSV once pt is [**Name (NI) 3225**] (will
titrate for comfort)
.
# LEUKOCYTOSIS
Likely due to UTI.
-treat infection
- trend CBC
- d/c picc line and culture tip
.
# [**Last Name (un) **]
Could be secondary to poor forward flow in setting of CHF and
systemic inflammation or venous congestion. Could also represent
complication from UTI.
- urine lytes for differentiation of pre-renal vs intrinsic
renal failure
- renal ultrasound r/o absce
