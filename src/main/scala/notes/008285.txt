History of Present Illness:
52yo male w/ MMP who presented to OSH after the onset of CP at
rest. Described CP as pressure in the center of his chest that
radiated across the base of his chest bilaterally and up to his
throat. It was not associated w/ SOB, n/v or diaphoresis. It
lasted for about 15 mins, but he had no nitro in the house, so
he called EMS. Was given 4 baby ASA by EMS and nitro x1 in the
ER before his CP resolved. First set CE at OSH were negative.
Had repeat episode of CP at 5am, resolved on its own. Again, had
another episode of CP while boarding the helicopter for
transport here. Was given fentanyl w/ resolution of his pain.
.
Last episode of CP was [**2106-3-22**] at [**Hospital3 417**] Hospital. Was
there for L subclavian vein stenting and in PACU, developed CP
similar in character to what he felt last night. Was kept in the
hospital for 1 week and underwent a chemical stress test which
he says revealed "abnormalities" but nothing that had to be
dealt with immediately. On discharge, he was told to resume
taking ASA daily. He had not been taking ASA or plavix since
[**7-12**] when he underwent surgery for his decubitus ulcers.
.
Last evening, at OSH, he was given ASA 325 + SL ntg w/ relief of
his CP. EKG on admission showed ST depression in V5-6, with ?
TWI I, II. Q waves in III, avF. Overnight, he did well until 5am
when he developed chest heaviness. It resolved on its own, but
his EKG showed worsening ST depressions in V5 and V6 and his
tropI increased from <0.1 to 1.6 (CK 45 -> 54). The decision was
made to transfer him to [**Hospital1 18**] for emergent cath. He was set for
ground transport when he began to develop CP again. He was
instead MedFlighted here as his BP was also tenous (SBPs in
80s-90s). He was started on reopro, heparin, and plavix (600mg
x1) and was transferred straight to the cath lab. In the cath
lab, it was found that he has in-stent restenosis and needs
surgical intervention. Plan is to take him to CABG once vascular
imaging performed to identify suitable grafts. IABP placed in
cath lab and referred to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 914**] for urgent CABG.

Imaging:
CATH [**2106-4-4**]:
LMCA 80% discrete
LAD 80% discrete
LCx proximal 80%
RCA 100%
.
1. Selective coronary angiography in this right dominant
circulation
demonstrated severe three vessel coronary artery disease. The
LMCA
stents had moderate distal instent restenosis. The proximal LAD
had an 80-90% instent restenosis. The distal LAD had only mild
luminal
irregularities. The D1 was a small vessel, but D2 was large and
had no flow limiting disease. The LCx also had an 80-90% instent
restenosis. The mid LCx was widely patent. The OM1 was a
moderate size vessel and OM2 was a large vessel. Neither had any
flow limiting disease. The RCA had a proximal total occlusion.
There were left to right, as well as, some right to right
bridging collaterals noted.
2. Non-selective angiograms of the RIMA and LIMA demonstrated
patent
vessels. There was a left subclavian vein stent noted.
3. Opening central aortic pressure was 89/59mmHg.
4. An 8Fr 40cc IABP was placed successfully from the right
common
femoral artery.
.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Severe instent restenosis of LM into LAD and LCx stents.
3. IABP placement.
4. Patent RIMA and LIMA.
