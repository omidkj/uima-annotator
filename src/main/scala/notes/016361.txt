Admission Date:  [**2130-7-6**]       Discharge Date:  [**2130-7-30**]


Service:  VASCULAR SURGERY

The patient expired on [**2130-7-30**].

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mrs. [**Known lastname 27830**] is an unfortunate 84
year old female with a history diabetes mellitus,
polycythemia [**Doctor First Name **], prior transient ischemic attacks,
bilateral carotid artery stenosis measured at 40 and 60% by
ultrasound and carotid Duplex studies; history of
hypertension, history of deep venous thrombosis, recurrent
pulmonary embolism, and renal insufficiency, who was admitted
to the Vascular Service after complaining of a several months
history, approximately four to five months, of claudication
and rest pain.  She had a right foot toe ulceration.  She was
noted to have Doppler-able dorsalis pedis and posterior
tibial on the right lower extremity.  She had a right femoral
angiogram which showed an occluded SFA and occluded dorsalis
pedis.  Given this finding, the patient was admitted and
optimized for surgery.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Ultimately, after being evaluated by
Cardiology and being cleared and being followed by the
Diabetes Service of [**Last Name (un) **], the patient did go to the
Operating Room by [**2130-7-13**], where she underwent a right
common femoral artery to above the knee popliteal graft using
PTFE and composite to the AT with non-reversed saphenous vein
graft done with angioscopy and valve lysis.  The patient had
a 200 cc blood loss.  There were no complications.  She got
transfused a unit of packed cells interoperatively and
received 3500 cc of Crystalloid, and underwent ............
and ................ with a PTFE, composite graft.  She left
the Operating Room in stable condition.

Over the next several days, the patient had complications of
postoperative renal failure and mental status changes.  Renal
consultation was obtained.  Their impression was she had a
cardiac event complicated with low cardiac output versus
sepsis as the likely potentiator of this persistent oliguria
and renal failure.  The patient was accordingly supported in
the VICU as well as the SICU intermittently as she did go
between both of these care units.

By [**7-24**], which would be postoperative day number 11 from
her operation, the renal attending that was consulting on the
case, Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 1313**], felt that the patient was probably
pre-renal secondary to worsening cor pulmonale, and
recommended to attempt to diurese the patient.  Her albumin
at this time was 2.5.

Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 1313**] did suggest to check troponin I for a question of
a cardiac event, as covered in the perioperative period to
precipitate this, to check for a fractional excretion of urea
to see if this was consistent with a prerenal state, continue
the diuretics, maintain blood pressure greater than 120 for
renal perfusion, and to start optimizing her nutrition.  A
Neurology consultation was obtained at this time also for her
altered mental status.  At that time, Neurology's impression
was that this was just an 84 year old woman with a prior
polycythemia [**Doctor First Name **], prior transient ischemic attacks,
hypertension, and diabetes mellitus, who was noted to have
difficulty speaking after right femoral to AT bypass graft
using composite PTFV and non-reversed saphenous vein.

Her neurologic examination was significant for inattention
and somewhat lethargic, which might reflex a metabolic
encephalopathy.  Their recommendations were to check a head
CT scan to evaluate a large stroke or bleed.  Also, to check
an MRI and diffusion wave images in an MRA.  Would defer if
her staples are an issue.  Consider to stop her
subcutaneously heparin since her INR was therapeutic.
Recheck urinalysis since the leukocyte esterase was also
positive and to continue support as needed.

By postoperative day number 12, she continued on diuresis.
Neurologically, a head CT scan was achieved that showed no
evidence of large intracranial bleed.  Cardiac-wise she had
good ejection fraction.  The rest of her electrolytes were
stable.  GI:  She was tolerating tube feeds to goal.
Infectious Disease:  She had an increasing white count.  She
was being diuresed with Lasix and Zaroxolyn.  Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 1313**] was
continued for her low urine output management.

Again the mental status changes were persistent.  There was
some question of a new cerebrovascular accident event despite
some negative imaging.  She was noted to have an orbital
bruit which was questionable of siphon stenosis.  A PA
catheter was thereafter changed to a CVL.

A consultation with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2148**], was obtained for
assistance in her mental status issue.  He was really unable
to shed much new light.  Ultimately over the next several
days, the patient's clinical status deteriorated.  Neurology
consult stated that an EEG that was obtained during her
work-up was a flat line result from [**2130-7-26**].  They wanted
to repeat the EEG to rule out any artifacts or rule out
seizure for any reason to explain her persistent
encephalopathy.

Overnight from [**7-27**] to [**7-28**], she developed some facial
twitching.  This responded to an Ativan dose times one and
then being stopped as well as repleting electrolytes as
needed.  Continued on LR at 15 hour tube feeds at goal,
Unasyn and Vancomycin, and ceftriaxone, and a bowel regimen
with medications.

After an extensive discussion was carried out with the
family, the family wished to make the patient comfort
measures only, and on [**2130-7-28**], this was done.

On [**2130-7-30**], the patient went into respiratory and cardiac
arrest.  Her pupils were noted to be fixed and dilated.
Bilateral carotid pulses were absent.  Thereafter she was
pronounced dead at 12:03 hours.
