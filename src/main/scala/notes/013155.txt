REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:    evl effusion - please do after
HD
Final Report: In comparison with the study of [**11-5**], the
pulmonary vascularity is essentially within normal limits. Again
there is extensive pleural plaquing with calcification in the
hemidiaphragmatic region with mild residual wall effusions.
Enlargement of the cardiomediastinal silhouette persists in a
patient with intact midline sternal wires. The right IJ sheath
has been removed.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr [**Known lastname **] was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] for heparinization and
hemodialysis preoperatively before aortic valve replacement and
coraonary artery bypass grafting. Carotid ulsound was also
completed during the pre operative period.
On  [**11-3**] he was brought to the operating room, please see
operative report for details. In summary he had: 1. Aortic valve
replacement, [**Street Address(2) 11688**]. [**Hospital 923**] Medical Biocor tissue valve. 2.
Coronary artery bypass grafting x1, left internal mammary artery
graft to left anterior descending. His bypass time was 122
minutes with a crossclamp time of 82 minutes. He tolerated the
operation well and post-operatively was transferred to the
cardiac surgery ICU in stable condition. He remained
hemodynamically stable in the immediate post-operative period,
woke neurologically intact and was extubated. He required
Neosynephrine infusion to support his blood pressure and stayed
in the ICU until POD4 when he was transferred to the stepdown
floor for additional reovery from surgery. All tubes lines and
drains were removed per cardiac surgery protocol. He worked with
the nursing and physical therapy services to advance his
activity level, he resumed his dialysis schedule.
The remainder of his hospital course was uneventful.
