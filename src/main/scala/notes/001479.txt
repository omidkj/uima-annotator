Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5790**]
Chief Complaint:
Dehydration, left recurrent chylothorax

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2198-5-30**] and [**2198-6-8**]: Ultrasound-guided therapeutic thoracentesis
(outpt)
[**2198-6-13**]: Left video-assisted thoracoscopy exploration and fibrin
glue application. Right video-assisted thoracoscopy thoracic
duct ligation and fibrin glue.
[**2198-6-22**]: Interventional Radiology - lymphangiography with
embolism of upper abdominal lymphatics up to the level of
cisterna chyli with microcoils and gelfoam slurry
[**2198-6-25**] Right pigtail placement for large pleural effusion
removed [**2198-6-28**]


History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 6955**] is a pleasant 76 year old female who underwent
video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery left upper lobe wedge
resection and left lower lobectomy on [**2198-5-18**]. Pathology
revealed a well differentiated adenocarcinoma from the LUL wedge
resection (with 1 cm of free margin). The lower lobectomy
revealed a 6-cm poorly differentiated mixed acinar and solid
adenocarcinoma (with clean margins). Post-operatively, she
developed a slow-rate chylous effusion which was conservatively
monitored until chest tube removal on [**2198-5-23**]. She was
discharged on [**2198-5-24**].

Upon return to clinic it was noted that she had been doing well
on oxygen therapy, but her pre-visit CXR revealed evidence of
left pleural effusion recurrence. IP was consulted and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
performed an ultrasound-guided thoracentesis on [**2198-5-30**]. This
removed 1500 mL of chylous fluid (pleural triglycerides > 400).
On [**2198-6-5**] she again returned to clinic with recollection of
the chylous effusion and had a second thoracentesis performed.
It was felt, at that time, that duct ligation may be warranted,
but that her bronchial stump needed adequate healing time. IP
performed thoracentesis on [**2198-6-5**] removing 1800 mL of chylous
fluid.

She was seen in clinic on [**2198-6-12**] with dyspnea, cough symptoms
and dehydration and was admitted directly for surgical
intervention with thoracic duct ligation for her persistent
chylous leak. She had surgery on [**6-13**], but still with a chyle
leak.  On [**2198-6-22**], she underwent lymphangiography with
embolization of the leaking area as well as far distal and
proximal to the area.

Bedside swallow evaluation [**2198-6-28**]: no evidence of aspiration

CTA [**2198-6-25**]
IMPRESSION:

1. Left lower lobe pulmonary thrombus in the setting of lower
lobectomy.
2. Moderate-to-large right pleural effusion with right basilar
collapse.
3. 6.0 cm x 5.1-cm fluid collection within the left pleural
space compatible
with loculated hydropneumothorax. Continued followup to this
area is
recommended.
4. Diffuse intralobular septal thickening, findings suggestive
of volume
overload.
5. Scattered punctate areas of hyperintensity seen in both
hemithoraces,
likely related to previous embolization procedure.

CXR [**2198-6-28**]
FINDINGS: PA and lateral chest views have been obtained with
patient in
upright position. Comparison is made with the next preceding AP
single view chest examination of [**2198-6-26**]. During the
interval, the right-sided pigtail ending pleural drainage tube
has been removed. No evidence of increased pleural effusion in
this area and no pneumothorax in the right apical area.

Diffuse left lower thorax density obliterating the diaphragmatic
contour
entirely remains rather unchanged. The same holds for evidence
of
contrast-dense linear structures, apparently remnants from a
thoracic duct
examination, remain in unchanged position. There is, however,
now evidence of a small 3 cm wide air-fluid level overlying the
left hilar area, a finding which was not present on the previous
portable examination. It is unclear whether this finding may
relate to changes in patient's position which is now upright. It
most likely represents a localized hydrothorax in this area
considering that the patient has recently undergone a left lower
lobectomy.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 6955**] was admitted to the Thoracic surgery service on
[**2198-6-12**] directly from clinic due to recurrent left sided
chylothorax, despite two thoracentesis and low fat diet. On
[**2198-6-13**] she underwent bilateral VATS with thoracic duct ligation
and fibrin glue. Her chylothorax persisted, therefore on [**2198-6-22**]
she underwent IR guided embolization of thoracic duct and upper
abdominal lymphatics, which was successful. Her left [**Doctor Last Name **] drain
revealed small serous output, therefore the drain was removed on
[**2198-6-25**]. CXR was stable. The patient however was short of breath
with hypoxemia on ABG. The patient underwent CTA of chest that
revealed increased right sided pleural effusion and thromus to
the [**MD Number(3) 25805**] that was previously resected. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 25806**] was
not concerned about PE and anticoagulation with this finding;
but a normal variant given her LLL lung resection. The patient
was transfered to the ICU and underwent emergent pig tail
pleural catheter placement which initially drained 1200ml, then
300-400ml every 4 hours, with about 2L over the evening. The
patient had marked improvement in her pulmonary status,
breathing comfortable, oxygenating well on less oxygen, improved
mentation, and less anxiety. She was transferred back to the
floor where
