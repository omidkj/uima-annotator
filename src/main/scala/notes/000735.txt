Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Sulfa (Sulfonamide Antibiotics)

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1881**]
Chief Complaint:
shortness of breath and productive cough

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Rigid bronchoscopy [**2174-8-18**]
Flex Bronchoscopy [**2174-8-19**]


History of Present Illness:
74F h/o anca positive vasculitis (Wegeners) with pulmonary and
renal involvement, complicated by tracheobronchial disease who
p/w fever. Patient visited pulm/rheum as outpatient on [**8-11**], and
was believed to have evidence of worsening tracheobronchial
disease vs infection. Written for levaquin but never obtained
rx. CT as outpatient on [**8-12**] showed pronounced opacities at the
lung bases bilaterally and stable appearance of wall thickening
of the distal trachea and right and left main stem bronchi.
Family reports increase in coughing with production of yellowish
sputum. She denies stridor, shortness of breath, or chest pain.
Has chronic DOE at baseline. The patient also reports loss of
appetite. She denies abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, or
diarrhea. Currently taking prednisone 20 mg daily (decreased
about 3 weeks ago) and has noticed that her chronic cough and
fatigue has gradually worsened on the lower dose.
.
In the ED, initial vs were: temp 101.8 110 110/53 20 92% RA.
EKG: sinus tach 106, LAD, QTC 450, old Q waves inferiorly.
HCAP coverage started with vanco/zosyn. Review CT chest from
[**8-12**] - pronounced nodules at the lung bases bilaterally likely
resolving wegener's (markedly improved since [**5-/2174**]), patchy
densities of bases b/l remain (also improved since [**5-/2174**]),
distal trachea and r/l mainstem bronchi demonstrate wall
thickening (similar [**3-/2174**]), R middle bronchus narrow. Given 2L
NS. Exam notable for coarse breath sounds, A&Ox3, baseline short
term memory loss and thrush. Blood cultures sent prior to abx
initiation. Chest xray obtained. Access is 20g in L arm. Labs
notable for WBC 29.2, bands 30, plts 507 and lactate 1.7. Most
recent vitals: 98.5 103 114/56 20 94%2L. Admitted to medicine w
concern for treatment failure of pna vs vasculitis flare.
.
On the floor, patient desatted to 86% after returning from a
walk to the bathroom. She quickly recovered and was asymptomatic
for the entire episode.
.
Review of sytems:
(+) Per HPI
(-) Denies fever, chills, night sweats, recent weight loss or
