Dyspnea

Defibrillator placement and epicardial lead placement [**2125-5-28**]


History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Last Name (un) 107967**] is a 44 year old female with non-ischemic CMP
(EF 25-30%), ESRD on dialysis, and anxiety presents with the
complaint of shortness of breath for the last few months but
worsening over the last week. This patient reports worsening
shortness of breath with exertion particularly over last few
days as well as orthopnea. She states that at times breathing
exercises help her dyspnea. She believes that she is currently
being underdialyzed as she has lost weight recently and so her
dry weight is lower. Notes from her last interactions with her
Atrius caregivers describe visits and telephone interactions
related to her shortness of breath that are ascribed to various
afflictions including anxiety and asthma/bronchitis. She was
given anxiolytic medications, albuterol and cough suppressants
with apparent limited effect. She has missed her last two
scheduled appointments for follow-up. Of note, the patient is
scheduled for BiV PPM/ICD placement this upcoming Monday.
Patient notes that about 1 week ago she started feeling worse
sob than she usually has and today decided to come to the
emergency department.

Findings
LEFT ATRIUM: Moderate LA enlargement.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Normal interatrial septum. No
ASD by 2D or color Doppler. Normal IVC diameter (<2.1cm) with
<35% decrease during respiration (estimated RA pressure
indeterminate).

LEFT VENTRICLE: Mild symmetric LVH. Moderately dilated LV
cavity. Severe global LV hypokinesis. No LV mass/thrombus.
Trabeculated LV apex. TDI E/e' >15, suggesting PCWP>18mmHg. No
resting LVOT gradient. No VSD.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Dilated RV cavity. Severe global RV free wall
hypokinesis. Paradoxic septal motion consistent with conduction
abnormality/ventricular pacing. Prominent moderator
band/trabeculations are noted in the RV apex.

AORTA: Normal aortic diameter at the sinus level. Normal
ascending aorta diameter. Normal aortic arch diameter.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. No MVP. No
MS. Moderate to severe (3+) MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Mildly thickened tricuspid valve leaflets. No
TS. Moderate to severe [3+] TR. Moderate PA systolic
hypertension. Given severity of TR, PASP may be underestimated
due to elevated RA pressure.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: No PS.

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.
Conclusions
The left atrium is moderately dilated. No atrial septal defect
is seen by 2D or color Doppler. The right atrial pressure is
indeterminate. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is moderately dilated.
There is severe global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF =
15-20 %). No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular
filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). There is no ventricular septal
defect. The right ventricular cavity is dilated with severe
global free wall hypokinesis. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Moderate to
severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid
regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. [In the setting of at least moderate to
severe tricuspid regurgitation, the estimated pulmonary artery
systolic pressure may be underestimated due to a very high right
atrial pressure.] There is no pericardial effusion.
