Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 905**]
Chief Complaint:
REASON FOR ICU ADMISSION: Possible need for angiogram to
embolize intrathoracic vessel and closer monitoring
CHIEF COMPLAINT: R wall hematoma in setting of hematocrit drop


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is an 88 y.o. M with HTN, hypercholesterolemia, who
presented to [**Hospital1 18**]-[**Location (un) 620**] ER on [**2190-4-28**] for lethargy and fever
from his [**Hospital3 **] facility. Per ED records, he had
lethargy at breakfast.  Daughter at that time had denied any
recent illnesses, but did endorese a recent change in BP meds.
Of note, he was admitted to [**Hospital6 1597**] in [**6-9**] with RLL
pneumonia.  Initial [**Hospital1 18**]-N ED VS: T 103.7  HR 104  BP 157/63
RR 22 O2 95%. EKG showed atrial fibrillation at [**Street Address(2) 74875**]
depression <1 mm in lateral leads.  CXR reportedly with RLL
pneumonia.  Labs notable for hyponatremia of 133, Cr of 1.2, and
leukocytosis of 25.9.

For his pneumonia, the patient was started on ceftazidime given
history of pseudomonas pneumonia at [**Last Name (un) 1724**]. ID was also consulted,
and the patient was switched to Zosyn.  PICC was placed on
[**2190-5-3**].  WBC improved to 16, and vancomcyin was empirically
started also.  CT chest 2 days prior to transfer showed new R
pleural effusion, worsening LUL consolidation and small L
pleural effusion with RLL being difficult to assess due to
effusion.  Thus, pulmonary was consulted 1 day PTA and
thoracentesis was performed. Per Hospitalist, 650 cc of
transudative fluid was removed. That evening, his INR was 1.7
and he was given 2 mg coumadin.  The morning of transfer, he
complained of the R chest area hurting.  A "fist size" swelling
was noted.  CT chest/abdomen/pelvis was completed prior to
transfer that showed R chest wall hematoma, moderate to large R
pleural effusion, and L moderate pleural effusion.
Subsequently, it was found that blood clots were oozing in the R
pleural effusion as well.  Per hospitalist, over the next 8
hours, the patient's hematoma grew to the size of "two hands"
(10x15 cm) in the setting of Hgb from 11-->8.  INR was 1.6 at
that time.  CT surgery was consulted, who recommended OSH ICU
transfer for closer monitoring. Per hospitalist, the patient was
never hemodynamically unstable with HR in 90-110 (afib) and
lowest BP 110.  He is being transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] given the
possibility of angiogram to embolize a intrathoracic vessel that
may have been damaged during thoracentesis.  He was ordered for
1 pRBC transfusion and vitamin K 1 mg SQ was given prior to
transfer.

Also during his hospitalization at [**Hospital1 18**]-N, he was found to be
in new atrial fibrillation on admission.  Cardiology consult
obtained, which thought afib was due to infection.  He was
started on metoprolol 50 mg po BID and started on lovenox and
coumadin for anticoagulation.  Atrial fibrillation was
reportedly as high as 120-140.  He was also given digoxin.  His
coumadin was titrated up but due to INR [**4-7**], this was held for a
few days.  He was restarted on coumadin as per above.

Lastly, [**12-6**] BCx grew SCN from OSH which was felt to be
contaminant.

CXR: There is interval increase in right pleural effusion, which
is layering. There is also increase in the right upper lung
consolidation that may represent an area of developing
atelectasis or infectious process. Cardiomediastinal silhouette
is unchanged and the left lung is grossly unremarkable except
for left retrocardiac atelectasis.

CT Chest:

Brief Hospital Course:
1. Acute blood loss anemia: attributed to chest wall hematoma
from the thoracentesis. Coumadin held. Thoracic surgery followed
patient. On [**5-11**] am CXR demonstrated increase in size of pleural
effusion. CT scan done demonstrated no significant change from
prior and fluid density was consistent with free-flowing
transudative effusion with a blood clot at the base, not
significantly changed.  CT surgery recommended consideration of
a pigtail catheter.  This was discussed with the daughter who
preferred a conservative approach with close monitoring of Hct,
BP and HR and size of hematoma. Pt's Hct remained stable since
the transfer to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**5-9**] and pt did not require an
embolization or a drainage.
- Pt should receive careful monitoring of vital signs, including
O2 sat, in order to follow his respiratory status carefully.
- Recommend a repeat CXR in 1 week to assess interval change and
weekly CBC with diff for f/u of hematocrit and pneumonia (WBC
count)
- The buldging subcutaneous hematoma and area of ecchymosis were
outlined on the day of discharge for comparison. Hematoma
measured 15 x 17 cm on discharge.

2. Pneumonia: health-care associated PNA as pt was at an
[**Hospital3 **] facility. Has h/o pseudomonas PNA and is
MRSA-colonized. Empirically completed 2 weeks of Zosyn during
hospital stay, on Vancomycin only now to complete 14 days
(Through [**5-18**]).
- No new growth on OSH culture data.

3. Atrial fibrillation: with RVR, new onset at the OSH. No
hemodynamic instability even when in A fib with RVR. Uptitrated
betablocker quickly to 150 mg tid. Digoxin was started at OSH
when A fib was first noted but discontinued upon transfer due to
narrow therapeutic index. HR in 80s-110s with Metoprolol 150 mg
TID.
- Can consider restarting digoxin if rate is not controlled on
monotherapy with BBker. Would not increase Metoprolol any
further.
- Full systemic anticoagulation (Coumadin, Lovenox) were held
during [**Hospital **] hospital stay given the acute bleed; Would start
full-dose ASA only rather than full anticoagulation with
Coumadin on Monday [**5-17**] as long as his hematoma and Hct are
stable. Will need a discussion regarding yearly risk of
thromboembolism/stroke once pt is out of this acute bleed stage.
CHADS2 score = HTN(1)+Age(1)=2.
- Pt should be wearing pneumoboots while in bed for DVT
prophylaxis.
.
4. Hypertension: Discontinued home amlodipine. BP
well-controlled on metoprolol as above.
.
5. Deconditioning: Pt was seen by Physical Therapy, who
recommended [**Hospital 3058**] rehab stay.
.
FEN: Regular soft dysphagia diet with supplements
ACCESS: OSH PICC (placed [**5-3**]). Keep until Vancomycin course is
done, then pull.
CODE STATUS: Resuscitate but DO NOT INTUBATE (per patient)
