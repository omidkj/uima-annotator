Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3705**]
Chief Complaint:
Difficulty ambulating, fatigue

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 59yoM with multiple medical problems including CAD
s/p stent, CVA x2, DM2, OSA, HTN, HLD, and advanced renal
disease who is presenting for evaluation of difficulty walking
and fatigue. He repeatedly falls asleep during our interview and
requires redirection on every question. He fully alerts and
answers questions appropriately, though his somnolence limited
the history-taking substantially.
.
He describes a chronic decline in function over the past few
months, noting that it has been more difficult to rise out of
chairs and ambulate. He at times attributed this to right hip
pain as the limiting factor, though later suggested the hip is
not painful. He feel fatigued throughout the daytime and has a
general lack of energy. He does carry a diagnosis of OSA and has
not been compliant with CPAP recently. He was unfortunately also
inconsistent with symptoms of lightheadedness during these
episodes of difficulty walking- He has been nauseated and has
not been drinking as much recently. He denies any trauma.
.
On arrival to the ED, his initial vitals were 98.8 56 117/52 20
95% 2L Nasal Cannula. He complained of severe back pain. There
was no concerning EKG findings, and a CXR revealed no acute
cardiopulmonary process. There was no fracture on a left hip
plain film as well.
.
On arrival to the floor, his initial vitals were T100 BP196/77
P72 RR20 Sat95RA. He recalled having told the ED about a bout of
tachypnea last night that was self limiting, but he has no
further chest symptoms. He mentions that he thinks he has been
sleeping poorly. He mentions right hip pain, though the left hip
was examined and radiographed downstairs. A broad review of
systems yields no focal weakness, no fevers/chills, no nausea or
vomiting, no chest pain or pressure, no abdominal pain, dysuria,
hematuria, no hematochezia or melena, no coughing or wheezing,
no weight gain or loss.

[**7-22**] CXR: Patchy opacity in the lingula, which is not specific
as to etiology; pneumonia is not excluded, but the area is not
well evaluated and opacity may be due to atelectasis.  Noting
the technical limitations of the film followup PA and lateral
radiographs may be helpful if pulmonary symptoms
were to persist.

7/16 L Hip film: No acute abnormality. If there is concern for
an occult fracture, recommend MRI.

[**7-23**] CXR: As compared to the previous radiograph, there is
unchanged evidence of lower lung volumes and moderate
cardiomegaly with signs of minimal fluid overload.  No
pneumonia, no larger pleural effusions.  No lung nodules or
masses.

Renal U/S: No hydronephrosis.

Brief Hospital Course:
59M with dCHF, stage IV CKD, HTN, DM who presented with subacute
weakness and fatigue, found to have [**Hospital 90796**] transferred to ICU
for hypoxia and AMS, most likely from flash pulmonary edema and
uremia.
.
.
# Hypoxia: Was oxygenating well on room air/2L NC at
presentation and now requiring 6L NC with pO2 75. A-a gradient
approx. 150. CXR with equivocal findings for PNA, also febrile
with increasing WBC though no left shift or leukocytosis at
admission. Some evidence of volume overload on exam with
elevated JVP and bibasilar crackles, also with evidence on CXR,
and SBP almost 200 at admission so may have had flash pulmonary
edema. ACS also on differential, EKG unchanged. PE also a
possibility though no evidence of significant hypoventilation
given pCO2 of 50 in patient with OSA and likely elevated pCO2 at
baseline. Uncontrolled OSA may also have been contributing.

Mr. [**Known lastname **] was transferred to ICU and received BiPAP for four
hours and his respiratory and mental status improved. After
BiPAP, he was able to maintain oxygenation on 3L NC. He received
course of levo
