CT Chest:

FINDINGS: There is mild upper lobe predominant centrilobular
emphysema.
There are scattered calcified granulomas. There are areas of
mucus impaction
in the lower lobes bilaterally.

Lung nodules are as follows: In the right upper lobe 2 mm (4:18,
27, 50, 65,
68, 78). In the left upper lobe 3 mm (4:37, 46), 4 mm
(4:41,52,99), 6 mm
(4:56), 1 mm (4:63, 64, 120, 129). In the right lower lobe 2 mm
(4:77), 3 mm
(4:112), 6 mm (4:120), 4 mm (4:125).

There is bronchial wall thickening in the lower lobes
bilaterally. A
hyperlucent region in the left lower lobe measuring
approximately 9.6 x 6.2 cm
can represent an area of severe emphysema or sequela of prior
infectious
process.

The airways are patent to the subsegmental level. There are
nonenlarged
mediastinal lymph nodes. Cardiac size is top normal.
Calcifications are
present in all coronary arteries. There is dense calcification
of the aortic
valve. There is no pleural or pericardial effusion. The aorta is
normal in
caliber.There is extensive calcification of the aorta from the
arch down to
the abdomen.

This examination is not tailored for subdiaphragmatic
evaluation. The upper
abdomen is unremarkable.

There are no bone findings of malignancy.


IMPRESSION: No evi

[**Last Name (un) **] of pneumonia or interstitial lung disease.

Emphysema.

Bronchitis.

Lung nodules. Followup in six months is recommended.

Coronary calcification.

TTE
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function are normal
(LVEF 65%). Left ventricular mechanical dyssynchrony is present,
without a reduction of ejection fraction. However, diastolic
dyssynchrony is present as well, with marked impairment of early
diastolic (E wave) filling, and almost the entire ventricular
filling volume occurring as a result of atrial systole (A wave
filling). Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall
motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. The right
ventricular cavity is dilated with normal free wall
contractility. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. The left
ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation. The
estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is
no pericardial effusion. There is an anterior space which most
likely represents a prominent fat pad.

Brief Hospital Course:
[**Age over 90 **]-year-old mildly demented woman with history of HTN, lymphoma
s/p chemo, renal insufficiency, GERD, who lives in [**Location (un) 103624**]
Living in [**Location (un) 55**], brought in by her daughter due
confusion/encephalopathy in the setting of hypoxia due to
suspected COPD exacerbation.

1)Encephalopathy, resolved due to hypoxia
2)Diastolic chronic CHF
3)Acute COPD exacerbation
4)CKD stage 3
5)GERD
6)Chronic cough

She had evidence of Emphysema on her chest CT (new diagnosis)
but has been previously treated with oxygen and bronchodilators,
though has not had prior exacerbations requiring admission.  She
was initially treated with BiPAP in the ED and admitted to the
MICU, where broad spectrum antibiotics were administered.  Due
to rapid clinical imrpovement and a CT without evidence of focal
pneumonia, her antibiotics were narrowed to oral azithromycin
(to end on [**3-13**]) for COPD exacerbation.  She was also started on
steroids, whi
