CHEST (PORTABLE AP)

Reason: CHF

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
75 year old woman s/p closure of chest after sternal wound
dehiscence
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
CHF
AP PORTABLE CHEST [**2181-12-12**] AT 12:01

HISTORY: Post-closure of chest after sternal wound dehiscence.

COMPARISON: Multiple priors, the most recent dated [**2181-12-10**].

FINDINGS: Horizontally oriented malleable plates over the
sternum are again evident, consistent with the given history.
While there is improved aeration of both lungs, significant
interstitial and alveolar edema are evident, predominantly in
the perihilar distributions with a gradient worse in the lung
bases. Bilateral effusions are noted. The cardiac silhouette
size remains enlarged but stable. There is a tortuous
atherosclerotic aorta again noted. An endotracheal tube is
evident and its distal tip lies approximately 7.0 cm from the
carina. A left subclavian approach central line is stable in
course and position with the distal tip at the superior
cavoatrial junction.

IMPRESSION: While the lungs are better inflated on the current
study, there is possibly worse bilateral interstitial and
alveolar pulmonary edema with bilateral pleural effusions again
evident. Endotracheal tube as above. Consider advancing 2.0-3.0
cm for optimal placement.

Aorta - Ascending:  2.7 cm  <= 3.4 cm
Aorta - Descending Thoracic:  *2.7 cm  <= 2.5 cm

Findings
LEFT ATRIUM: No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the LAA.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: PFO is present. Left-to-right
shunt across the interatrial septum at rest.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Low normal LVEF.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Borderline normal RV systolic function.

AORTA: Normal ascending aorta diameter. Simple atheroma in
ascending aorta. Simple atheroma in descending aorta.

AORTIC VALVE: No AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Moderately thickened mitral valve leaflets.
Trivial MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Mild [1+] TR.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Physiologic (normal) PR.

PERICARDIUM: Small pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify I was present in compliance with HCFA
regulations. The patient was under general anesthesia throughout
the procedure. The TEE probe was passed with assistance from the
anesthesioology staff using a laryngoscope. No TEE related
complications.
Conclusions
Patient presented with severe SOB, wound dehiscence, one month
post AVR.
No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the left atrial
appendage.
A patent foramen ovale is present. A left-to-right shunt across
the interatrial septum is seen at rest.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF
50-55%). Right ventricular systolic function is borderline
normal.
There are simple atheroma in the ascending aorta. There are
simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. Aortic Valve:
Not able to clearly see individual leaflets. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. A peak gradient of 16, mean of 9 is
measured.
The mitral valve leaflets are moderately thickened. Trivial
mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is a small pericardial effusion, and large bilateral
pleural effusions.


Brief Hospital Course:
She was admitted to cardiac surgery. She was diuresed with lasix
and her medications were adjusted for her hypertension. She
awaited normalization of her INR before bedside sternal
debridement and right thoracentesis for 100 ml of serosanguinous
fluid on [**11-17**]. CT chest showed sternal dehiscense, and her
breathing worsened, and she was taken to the operating room on
[**11-20**] where she underwent sternal debridement, vac dressing
placement and bilateral chest tube placement. She was
transferred to the ICU in stable condition. She remained sedated
and paralyzed until she was taken back to the operating room on
[**11-23**] where she underwent sternal plating, and pec flap. She was
followed by ID. Cultures grew MSSA and she was started on
nafcillin which was switched to vanco for increasing creatinine.
She comntinued to require some neo. She was extubated on [**11-27**]
but required reintubation for respiratory failure. She was
started on fluconazole for yeast in urine and cefepime for
?pneumonia. She was seen by renal for ARF. She was bronched on
[**11-28**]. She was maintained on tube feeds.  She was started on
natrecor for diuresis. She was started on cipro then meropenum
for pseudomonas in urine and sputum, and flagyl for ? of cdiff.
She required frequent transfusions and was guaiac positive. She
became hypernatremic and was started on free water flushes. She
was extubated again on [**12-6**].  She was seen by speech and swallow
and began a diet of thin liquids and ground solids. She had some
areas of necrosis and drainage on her sternal incision, and
reclosure in the OR was planned. SHe was taken back to the OR on
[**12-12**] where her sternal wound was debrided and reapproximated. She
was transferred back to the ICU. Swallow evaluation recommended
thin liquids and regular consistency solids. She was extubated
post op but required bipap overnight. She was restarted on
coumadin. OR cultures grew VRE and vanco was changed to
linezolid. After discussing the antibiot
