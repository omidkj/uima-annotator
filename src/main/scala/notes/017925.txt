Brief Hospital Course:
59M with type 1 diabetes, ESRD recently started on HD, h/o
epidural abscess transferred for neurosurgical evaluation and
found to be in DKA.

# Diabetic Ketoacidosis: On [**4-2**] found to have DKA with AG 30
and patient had missed his long acting insulin dose prior to
admission.  No source of infection was found to have prompted
his DKA.  Additionally, on admission there was no evidence of
cardiac ischemia that may have prompted it.  Thus, the episode
was attribued to a missed insulin dose.  In the ICU he was given
fluids and placed on an insulin gtt.  Once his gap closed he was
transitioned to subcutaneous insulin.

# Diabetes.  Patient states he is type 1 and has been on insulin
although was on oral agents before.  He has been very difficult
to control since [**2168-11-16**] with numbers running in the
300-400s and frequent hospital visits, HgbA1c here 8.7%. Suspect
there has been a component of uremia making patient resistant to
insulin. Hopefully, with more stable HD his blood glucose will
be easier to control.  After he was transitioned off the insulin
drip, he was continued on his home dosing of Glargine 25 units
QHS and a Humalog sliding scale.  He was discharged with this
regimen and had good glycemic control but will need continued
titration as an outpatient for further improvement.  Upon
discharge, patient and wife expressed that they will call the
[**Hospital **] Clinic for further management.

# Elevated Troponins.  Concerning for an NSTEMI, but uncertain
if clearly met criteria.  He did have an elevated Troponin, CK,
and CK-MB but no EKG changes and was asymptomatic.  Could be
demand ischemia in setting of DKA and severe stress.  He was
continued on ASA 81mg daily.  His Atorvastatin was increased to
80mg daily.  Additionally, he was started on low dose Metoprolol
12.5 mg [**Hospital1 **].  He was on Labetolol prior to admission, but his
blood pressure was well controlled without this medication.
Likely he will need less blood pressure meds given hemodialysis.
 Upon discharge, patient was instructed to discuss his new
medications with his primary care physician.

# Leukocytosis.  This is possibly due to acute demarginalization
in setting of DKA. Blood cultures and urine cultures were
negative or no growth to date upon discharge.  CXR without
evidence of an acute process.  Throughout hospitalization
remained pain free and afebrile without any localizing sypmtoms
of infection.

# Back pain.  History of epidural abscess in the [**2150**].  Upon
admission, he was seen by Neurosurgery who suggested an
infectious work-up but no need for imaging of his spine given
lack of localizing symptoms.  Back pain resolved in ED and did
not recur during hospitalization.  This was likely secondary to
muscle spasm in the setting of his hemodialysis.

# End Stage Renal Disease.  Presumed to be secondary to diabetes
and HTN.  He was followed by Renal while inpatient and was
dialyzed.  He has a Quentin catheter in his right chest and a
maturing fistula in his right forearm.  He was also continued on
calcium acetate and discharged with continued dialysis as an
outpatient.

# Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease.  Patient states he is
on Advair at home. While inpatient he was placed on standing
Ipratropium and PRN Albuterol.  He was discharged on his prior
medications.

# Anemia.  This was presumed to be secondary to ESRD.  His iron
studies were checked an most consistent with anemia of chronic
disease.

# Altered mental status.  This briefly occurred while in the
ICU, prompting intubation for airway protection.  He was
successfully extubated and had no further symptoms of confusion.
 This may have been related to pain medication or uremia given
his ESRF.

Patient requested to be a FULL CODE while inpatient.
