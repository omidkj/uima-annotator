Service: SURGERY

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3223**]
Chief Complaint:
Status post-crush injury.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
1.  Exploratory laparotomy.
2.  Oversewing of multiple mesenteric vessels.
3.  Oversewing of liver laceration.
4.  Small intestinal resection.
5.  Exploratory laparotomy and peritoneal irrigation.
6.  Small intestinal resection x3.

History of Present Illness:
Mr.[**Known lastname **] is a 46 M s/p crush injury at construction site. He
was unfortunately pinned between two trucks and was brought in
by EMS, initially hemodynamically stable, complaining of
inability to feel below his umbilicus. In the emergency
department he was alert, oriented, and responsive. An initial
FAST exam was negative, however, Mr.[**Known lastname **] shortly began
complaining of difficulty breathing and was noted to have an
increasingly distended abdomen. Repeat FAST exam was equivocal
and a subsequent DPL was grossly positive. He was taken
emergently to the OR for exploratory laparotomy.

Past Medical History:
CAD, DM2, s/p CABG


Social History:
Supportive and involved family network.
Worked as a foreman in construction

Family History:
Noncontributory.

Physical Exam:
VS:
GEN: awake, alert, oriented x3. Complaining of decreased
sensation below the umbilicus intermittently
HEENT: Loss of L eye vision in all fields
CV:RRR
PULM: Breath sounds equal bilaterally. Good chest wall
excursion.
ABD: Soft NT/ND.  Nl rectal tone without induration.  Incision
with good granulation tissue
PELVIS:Stable.
EXT: No injuruy.  Min edema
NEURO: Moves all extremities

Pertinent Results:
TRAUMA #2 (AP CXR & PELVIS POR   Clip # [**Clip Number (Radiology) 70702**]
IMPRESSION:
1.  No definite evidence of osseous injury.  Unusual appearance
of the right proximal femur is most likely related to prominent
osteophytes, although CT scan could be performed if there is
clinical concern for a femoral neck fracture.  Chest radiograph
is severely limited due to exclusion of the upper thorax.
2.  Severe degenerative changes of the hips bilaterally,
slightly worse on the
---------

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)   Clip # [**Clip Number (Radiology) 70703**]
CONCLUSION:  Endotracheal tube in position as described above.
Bilateral
patchy pulmonary opacities consistent with pulmonary contusion
and/or edema.
---------

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST   Clip # [**Clip Number (Radiology) 70704**]
IMPRESSION:  Probable mild cerebral edema without evidence of
herniation. This may be secondary to generalized fluid overload
status of the patient. Close followup and clinical correlation
is recommended.  No evidence of hemorrhage or traumatic injury.

---------

CT CHEST W/O CONTRAST; CT ABDOMEN W/O CONTRAST   Clip # [**Clip Number (Radiology) 70705**]

IMPRESSION:
1.  Distraction injury of the lumbar spine at the level of L1/L2
with mild 3-4 mm retrolisthesis of L1 over L2.  No definite
osseous spinal canal narrowing is appreciated.  However, CT does
not provide good detail of the epidural or intradural spacea.
MRI could be considered to evaluate spine injury if indicated.
2.  Thickened remaining small bowel could represent bowel wall
edema related to surgery and fluid overload, but residual bowel
ischemia cannot be excluded.
3.  Left transverse process fractures of L1, L2 and L4 as
described above.
4.  Bilateral large pleural effusions with associated
atelectasis.
5.  Packing material within the abdominal cavity.
---------

CT C-SPINE W/O CONTRAST   Clip # [**Clip Number (Radiology) 70706**]
IMPRESSION:
1.  Preserved cervical spine alignment.  Tiny osseous focus
visualized
superior to the C7 spinous process, which may represent a chip
fracture versus a dystrophic calcification.
2.  Lung effusions and consolidation, right greater than left.
---------

CT T-SPINE W/O CONTRAST   Clip # [**Clip Number (Radiology) 70707**]
IMPRESSION:
1.  No evidence of traumatic injury to the thoracic spine.
2.  Large bilateral effusions with consolidations, right greater
than left. L1 fracture.  Please refer to the lumbar spine report
for further details.
---------

CT L-SPINE W/O CONTRAST   Clip # [**Clip Number (Radiology) 70708**]
IMPRESSION:  Avulsion fracture of the anterior portion of the
inferior
endplate of the L1 vertebra, with widened disc space consistent
with a
hyperextension injury. Left L4 transverse process fracture with
an equivocal left L2 transverse process fracture.
---------

LIVER OR GALLBLADDER US (SINGL   Clip # [**Clip Number (Radiology) 70709**]
IMPRESSION:  Findings equivocal for cholecystitis. HIDA scan is
recommended for further evalutaion.
---------

MR HEAD W/O CONTRAST; MRA BRAIN W/O CONTRAST   Clip # [**Clip Number (Radiology) 70710**]

MRI BRAIN FINDINGS:  No intracranial mass lesion, hydrocephalus,
shift of
normally midline structures, minor or major vascular territorial
infarct
IMPRESSION:  No findings to suggest brain swelling.
Subgaleal scalp fluid collection.
Opacification of the maxillary sinuses, right mastoid air cells,
and ethmoid sinus.
----------

MR CERVICAL SPINE W/O CONTRAST; MR THORACIC SPINE W/O CONTRAST

IMPRESSION:  Small amount of prevertebral fluid may indicate
ligamentous
injury, even in the absence of direct evidence of such.  Please
note that the quality of study is compromised by motion
artifact.

MR CERVICAL SPINE W/O CONTRAST; MR THORACIC SPINE W/O CONTRAST

IMPRESSION:  Small amount of prevertebral fluid may indicate

injury, even in the absence of direct evidence of such.  Please
note that the quality of study is compromised by motion

----------

MR L SPINE W/O CONTRAST   Clip # [**Clip Number (Radiology) 70711**]
IMPRESSION:  Three column ligamentous disruption, including torn
anterior
wedged in ligament, posterior longitudinal ligament and
ligamentum flavum, as well as left facet capsule disruption.
This constitutes an unstable injury. No hemorrhage or spinal
cord compromise.

Brief Hospital Course:
He was admitted to the trauma surgery service under the care of
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 519**].  He was taken to the OR on [**2183-10-21**] after positive DPL
where he was found to have extensive damage to the SMA, liver
laceration, small bowel perforation and retroperitoneal bleed.
Artery, laceration and retroperitoneal bleed were repaired and a
section of jejunum was resected, abodmen was packed and he was
sent back to the TSICU.  On [**10-22**] he was taken back to the OR
where bowel was resected from the jejunum through [**1-10**] of
transverse colon.  Abdomen was packed and he was sent back to
TSICU. He remained in the TSICU with steady improvement in his
clinical status. A tracheostomy was performed, and a Passy-Muir
Valve was placed. TPN was administered via PICC line for
long-term nutrition. Ophthalmology was consulted as pt
complained of loss of vision in left eye; they feel this
represents a traumatic optic neuropathy and that it is likely
irreversible at this stage.  He is pending an attending level
evaluation
