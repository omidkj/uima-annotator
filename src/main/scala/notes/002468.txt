Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 165**]
Chief Complaint:
chest pain and shortness of breath


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
. Urgent coronary artery bypass graft x4; left internal

    saphenous vein graft to posterior left ventricular
    branch and saphenous vein sequential graft to obtuse

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 53743**] is a 74 yo M with ILD, COPD, CAD, dCHF, DMII and CKD
who presented with intermittent chest pain over the course of
the last 3 days associated with shortness of breath. Pain is
non-radiating. It is made worse with swallowing. Patient
eventually decided to come in after talking to a friend with a
cardiac history.

In the ED, Initial VS were 98.3 73 116/67 16 98% RA. Troponin
was noted to be elevated at 0.18. EKG showed PRWP and <1mm ST
depressions in V4,V5. He received Aspirin and was admitted to
the cardiology service for further management.
Cardiac cath was done and Cardiac surgery was consulted for
coronary revascularization.

Conclusions for post-bypass data

REGIONAL LEFT VENTRICULAR WALL MOTION:





     N = Normal, H = Hypokinetic, A = Akinetic, D = Dyskinetic
Conclusions
PRE-BYPASS:
No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of
the left atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of the right
atrium/right atrial appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen
by 2D or color Doppler.

There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. There is mild regional left
ventricular systolic dysfunction with focalities in the mid and
apical inferior. inferoseptal and inferolateral walls.. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 45
%).

Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.

There are simple atheroma in the ascending aorta. There are
simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.

There are three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets
are moderately thickened. The left coronary cusp is non mobile.
A 0.3 x 0.3 cm calcium deposit seenon the right coronary cusp.
There is mild aortic valve stenosis (valve area 1.6cm2). No
aortic regurgitation is seen.

The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] was notified in person of the results before surgical
incision.

POST-BYPASS:
Intact thoracic aorta.
LVEF 50%.
There is a mild improvement of wall motions in the inferior,
inferoseptal and inferolateral segments.
No new valvular findings. Aortic valve findings remains the same
as prebypass.
  I certify that I was present for this procedure in compliance
with HCFA regulations.
