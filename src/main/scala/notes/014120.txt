Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2901**]
Chief Complaint:
Transfer s/p cardiac arrest

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Internal Defibrillator placement
Pulmonary Intubation


History of Present Illness:
55-year-old male with history of two vessel CAD, ischemic
cardiomyopathy, EF ~15%, mitral regurgitation, and diabetes on
oral agents who presents from OSH s/p VT/VF cardiac arrest. By
report, patient had been having nausea/vomiting and diarrhea for
several days prior to admission. In this setting had decreased
PO intake. On night of admission was dry heaving for some time.
Heard by his sister to be gurgling and she came up stairs to
find patient pulseless, with eyes rolled back, rigid and foaming
at mouth. Immediately initiated CPR and family called EMS.

On arrival, EMS found patient to be in VF and was shocked into
VT. Shocked 3 times in total for VT/VF. Patient was intubated on
arrival to OSH ED. Was given epinephrine/lidocaine/atropine and
amiodarone with subsequent return of perfusing rhythm.
Reportedly was responsive in the ED, and then had a second
arrest the details of which are unclear but was thought to be
respiratory in nature. Was admitted to the ICU where impression
was for cardiogenic shock with oliguric renal failure likely [**3-16**]
ATN.

In ICU, patient on dopamine/levophed for presumed cardiogenic
shock. CE's reportedly unremarkable and no e/o ischemia by ECG
but [**Last Name (un) **] baseline LBBB. Patient inutabed for airway protection
and requiring versed for sedation. Course c/b hyperglycemia
requiring insulin gtt. Now transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] for further
management.

On arrival to [**Hospital1 18**], patient intubated with stable VS on
dopamine/levophed.

Unable to obtaine further review of systems as patient intubated
and sedated.

Radiologic Studies
CXR ([**2106-4-10**]) - Severe cardiomegaly has progressed, but there is
no pulmonary edema or pleural effusion. ET tube, right internal
jugular line, and nasogastric tube are in standard placements.
No pneumothorax or appreciable pleural effusion.

CXR ([**2106-4-16**]) - Severe cardiomegaly is unchanged. Calcification
seen along the left lateral ventricular border on the PA view
and anteriorly on the lateral view might be consistent with left
ventricular aneurysm. The mediastinum is unremarkable. The lungs
are clear.
The pacemaker defibrillator inserted terminates at the expected
location of the right ventricle.
There is no evidence of pleural effusion or pneumothorax.

Echo ([**2106-4-12**]) - The left and right atria are moderately
dilated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
The left ventricular cavity is severely dilated with apical
aneurysm and severe global hypokinesis. The basal inferolateral
and anterolateral walls contract best (but are hypokinetic). The
remaining segments are near akinetic (LVEF = 20-25%). No masses
or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. The right ventricular
cavity is mildly dilated with free wall hypokinesis. The
diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are
normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal
with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral
valve prolapse. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Thre
is mild-moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There
is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2106-3-24**],
right ventricular cavity enlargement and free wall hypokinesis
are now seen. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure
is also slightly higher. Left ventricular cavity size and
regional systolic function are similar.
