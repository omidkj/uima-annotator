Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 33705**] was admitted from an OSH on [**2181-3-23**] with aortic
stenosis for evaluation for aortic valve replacement.  Because
of her history of GIB a GI consult was obtained with
recommendations for upper an lower endoscopy.  On [**3-26**] she
underwent endoscopy showing external hemorrhoids, diverticulosis
of the sigmoid colon and descending, polyp in the transverse
colon, polyp in the mid-ascending colon (biopsy), and mass in
the proximal ascending colon (biopsy).  Recs were then made to
await biopsy results as well as obtain CT scan of abdomen and to
start IV portonix.  A pancreatic mass was detected for which a
general surgery consult was obtained; no recommendations for
surgical intervention were made.  In this same time period Mrs.
[**Known lastname 33705**] began experinecing nose bleeds for which an ENT consult
was obtained.
After thorough pre-op workup, it was decided that Mrs. [**Known lastname 33705**]
would continue on the the OR for AVR.
On [**2181-4-2**] she proceeded to the OR with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for an
aortic valve replacement with a 23 mm CE magna pericardial
tissue valve.  Please see op note for full details.  On her
operative evening she was slow to wake up and was unable to
extubate.  She was successfully weened and extubated in POD one
and was transferred to the inpatient floor for further
management and rehabilitation.
On POD two her chest tubes were discontinued and physical
therapy was initiated.  On POD three her carduac pacing wires
were discontinued and she continued to progress.  On POD three
she also experienced runs of afib rising to a rate in the 150s.
Over the next several days she continued to progress well with
ongoing physical therapy and electrolyte repletion.  She was
also started on warfarin for her pre-op diagnosis of atrial
fibrillation.
On POD seven it was decided that hse was stable for transfer to
a rehabilitation facility but was not yet cleared by physical
tharapy and it was decided that she was safe for transfer to
rehab.
