Conclusions:
LVEF 60%
The left atrium is moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric
left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF 60%);
however, the apex
appears focally aneurysmal and dyskinetic. An apical left
ventricular
mass/thrombus cannot be excluded. Right ventricular chamber size
and free wall
motion are normal. The ascending aorta is moderately dilated.
The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
present. No
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is moderate
pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. The pulmonic valve leaflets are
thickened. There
is no pericardial effusion.


Brief Hospital Course:
[**5-23**]: Admitted for elective endovascular AAA repair but noted to
be septic from abdominal source.  Ruptured AAA ruled out by
nonocontrast CT, and patient transferred to ICU for pressor to
maintain BP.

[**5-24**]: Patient's BP improved with triple antibiotics, IV fluids &
levophed.  However, patient's respiratory status worsened & she
was intubated for airway protection.  She developed rapid atrial
fibrillation & was electrically cardioverted.  A swan ganz
catheter was placed for fluid management.

[**5-25**]: blood cultures grew out anaerobic gram negative rods.
antibiotics weaned to levo/flagyl.  pressors weaned.

[**5-26**]: extubated. swan changed to TLC CVL

[**5-27**]: transferred to VICU.  ? of aspiration on PO intake

[**5-28**]: negative bedside swallow evaluation for aspiration. Diet
started & tolerated.

[**5-29**]: PT recommended rehab.  diuresis begun.

[**5-31**]: accepted at [**Location (un) **]. discharged in good condition
