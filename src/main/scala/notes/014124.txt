Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 2643**] was admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 196**] s/p [**Hospital1 **]-V/ICD Pacer placement
([**2144-7-20**]) and L Lead Adjustment on [**2144-8-5**] to evaluate her
SOB/decr OS and pleuritic chest pain/chest tenderness which were
deemed likely related to CHF/L Pleural Effusion (vs Atelectasis)
and with pain from surgery, respectively.

1. DOE/CHF. Upon transfer to [**Hospital Unit Name 196**], the patient had SOB, which
was mainly exertion (comfortable at rest, but was very
fatigued). Initialy, her O2 requirement was 3-4L to maintain
OS>93: Likely CHF-related along with possible left pleural
effusion (vs. atelectasis). CXR was read as 'large left pleural
effusion.' Of note, the loudness of her voice was diminished
upon transfer, presumed seconday to laryngeal injury during
intubation. Over the course of her hospital stay, her exercise
tolerance, dyspnea, and energy level improved with diuresis
(Lasix PO and IV) along with incentive spirometry and physical
therapy. Her voice quality was drastically improved by
discharge. The procedure team saw the patient on [**8-10**] to eval
for possible therapeutic thoracentesis, but felt the CXR along
with U/S + exam findings were more consistent with atelectasis
and not effusion. Thus, there was no intervention. Pt had mild
O2 requirement on DC and was sent home with VNA and home O2
(93-94% on 1-2L; 89%-93% on RA). Her CHF drug regimen included
Carvedilol 12.5 mg PO BID, Digoxin 0.125 mg PO QD, Losartan
Potassium 75 mg PO QD, along with Lasix 60-80mg daily and
Spironolactone 25 mg PO QD, which were both held on her day of
DC secondary to rising creatinine (1.8 from 1.3). The patient
was encouraged  to ambulate as well as to use her IS. She was
seen by PT.

2. Acute Renal Insufficiency. Likely prerenal after diuresis.
Held meds as above and rechecked Cr: trended down to 1.1 on day
of DC.

3. Chest Tenderness/Pain. Pt was tender near incision site and
initially had chest pain with breathing. Chest tenderness was
secondary to CT surgical procedure. It was well controlled with
Ibuprofen 400-600 mg q6-8h. She was also on Oxycodone PRN and
Cyclobenzaprine HCl 5 mg PO QD and again, encouraged ambulation,
IS, and PT. Her pleurisy and chest pain/tenderness all had
drastically improved upon DC.

4. HTN. SBPs 90s-110s. Appeared to be normotensive to
hypervolemic, yet had somewhat low SBPs, but stable. We
continued Carvedilol 12.5 mg PO BID, Digoxin 0.125 mg PO QD,
Losartan Potassium 50 mg PO QD, and Spironolactone 25 mg PO QD.

5. Anemia. HCT was 28.6-28.7 upon transfer; Pt was transfused 1U
PRBC on [**2144-8-9**] to allievate her symptoms in face of CHF. Her
HCT then rose to >35 and remained at that level for the
remainder of her hospital course. The etiology of the anemia was
unclear, although it may have been peri-operative. Fe studies
showed low iron, high ferritin and nml TIBC (low end of nml):
thus, likely inflammation in setting of Fe-deficiency anemia.

6. Depression/Anxiety. Continued Escitalopram Oxalate 20 mg PO
QD.

7. FEN. Low salt/Heart healthy diet.

8. PPx. Colace, Senna, Lactulose. SQ Heparin. Pantoprazole 40 mg
PO Q24H (used PPI because of Ibuprofen use and recent epigastric
pain).

9. Code. Full.

10. Dispo. DCed to home with VNA and home O2.
