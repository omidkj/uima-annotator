History of Present Illness:
82 y/o retired pathologist w/ hx of heart mumur and lack of
medical care x 20 years with recent [**Hospital1 18**] admission [**6-5**] for
syncope now c/o confusion and slurred speech x 1 month. The
daughter indicated that the pt would say he was about to go to
work, though he has been retired for some time. His speech has
also become progressively more slurred. The past week has been
particularly bad, especially today. His daughter reports
worsening bipedal edema over 1 month.
.
ED course: Pt received lopressor iv 5mg x 4 and hydralazine 10mg
iv x 1 to control BP down to 130-150. The ER staff d/w neurosurg
attending who happened to be there to look at the CT head. The
neurosurgeon did not feel that the basal ganglion lesion merited
neurosurgical intervention. Neurology then saw the pt, with
their recs as below. A renal consult was obtained for creatinine
of 9 up from 4. The patient was admitted to the ICU for close BP
monitoring and electrolyte monitoring in the setting of uremic
metabolic acidosis and intraparenchymal hemorrhage in the basal
ganglia.
.
ROS: The pt had cough, sore throat, and airway congestion one
month ago, which resolved two weeks ago without treatment. He
denies those symptoms currently.
He denies focal neurologic deficit, visual or hearing changes,
numbness, tingling, weakness, fall, LOC, lightheadedness, CP,
SOB, dyspnea, difficulty with stooling or urinating, bloody or
tarry stools or bloody urine.

.
[**2200-12-31**] CT head non-contrast:
IMPRESSION: Small 5-mm focus of intraparenchymal hemorrhage in
the right basal ganglia. New since the prior exam.
.
[**2200-12-31**] CXR:
IMPRESSION: Left pleural effusion with associated retrocardiac
opacity, which
may represent atelectasis versus infiltrate. Clinical
correlation is
requested.
.
[**2200-12-31**] EKG (my read): NSR, LAD, 1st degree AV block,
incompletely widened QRS comlex, ST elevation in V3; ST segment
w/ abnl morphology in V2 and V3 w/o elevation. Overall this EKG
shows interval reducation of the ST elevations of the V2-V4
leads.
.
Renal/Abdominal Ultrasound:
1. Echogenic kidneys in keeping with chronic renal failure. No
hydronephrosis.
2. Small bibasilar pleural effusions and partial left lower lobe
atelectasis.
.
[**2201-1-1**] 9:15 AM Successful placement of right IJ triple-lumen
VIP catheter which can be used for dialysis and IV access with
tip at the cavoatrial junction. The line is ready for use.
.
[**2201-1-2**] ECHO: Conclusions:
1. The left atrium is mildly dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated.
2. There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The
left
ventricular cavity size is normal. There is mild global left
ventricular
hypokinesis. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
mildly depressed.
3. The ascending aorta is markedly dilated
4. The aortic valve leaflets are severely thickened/deformed.
There is severe aortic valve stenosis. Mild to moderate ([**2-2**]+)
aortic regurgitation is seen.
5. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate (2+)
mitral
regurgitation is seen.
6. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is mild
pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension.
7. There is a small pericardial effusion.
8. Compared with the findings of the prior study of [**2200-6-19**],
there has been no significant change.
.
[**1-5**] EKG: Sinus rhythm. First degree A-V heart block. Probable
left atrial abnormality. Left anterior fascicular block.
Probably old inferior wall myocardial infarction. Probable old
anterior myocardial infarction. Probable left ventricular
hypertrophy. Compared to the previous tracing no significant
change.
.
CENTRAL TUNNELED W/O PORT  [**2201-1-6**]:
INDICATION: Chronic renal insufficiency requiring dialysis. The
patient presents for conversion of a temporary hemodialysis
catheter to a tunneled hemodialysis catheter. Successful
conversion of a temporary double-lumen VIP dialysis catheter to
a tunneled 14.5 French, 19 cm tip-to-cuff dual-lumen dialysis
catheter via the right internal jugular vein, with tip at the
junction of the superior vena cava and the right atrium. The
catheter is ready for use.
.
CXR [**1-6**]:COMPARISON: Chest radiograph dated [**2201-1-4**].
FINDINGS: Again note is made of central venous catheter
terminating at the junction of SVC and right atrium. Again note
is made of cardiomegaly and tortuous aorta, overall unchanged
compared to the prior study. Note is made of bibasilar opacity
associated with effusion, probably representing atelectasis;
however, pneumonia, pneumonia cannot be excluded. The bibasilar
opacities are slightly decreased compared to the chest x-ray
dat
