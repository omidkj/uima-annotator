Admission Date:  [**2138-8-26**]     Discharge Date:


Service:  CARDIAC

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 87-year-old
female with past medical history of atrial fibrillation,
hypertension, congestive heart failure with an ejection
fraction of 45-55% and seizure disorder who presented to an
outside hospital on [**8-26**] with complaint of nausea,
chest pain and shortness of breath for approximately two to
three days.  At the outside hospital, she was noted to have
inferior ST elevations on electrocardiogram and was
transferred to [**Hospital6 256**] for
further management.

On arrival, she was complaining of dyspnea and pleuritic
chest discomfort only when coughing.  CKs were noted to peak
at 254 with an MB of 19.  She underwent cardiac
catheterization which demonstrated two vessel disease, 100%
mid left anterior descending and 100% proximal right coronary
artery occlusion, inferior hypokinesis and apical akinesis of
the left ventricle was also noted.  The decision was made to
pursue medical management and no intervention was performed.
She was then returned to the floor in stable condition.

On the a.m. admission to the Coronary Care Unit, which was
hospital day number four, while being repositioned, patient
became unresponsive and lethargic.  Of note, patient's
daughter spoke with her about an hour before without noticing
anything unusual.  In addition, she was also thought to have
left-sided hemiparesis and was tachypneic at a rate of 40.
02 saturation was stable at 93% on three liters.  Arterial
blood gases on 100% nonrebreather was 7.34/38/189.  Chem-7
and CBC were unremarkable.  No changes from prior
electrocardiogram.  She was then intubated for airway
protection and was then sent to head CT which was negative
for any evidence of acute bleed.  She was then brought to the
Coronary Care Unit.  A Neurology consult was obtained and
recommended MRI.  The patient was sent to MRI.  This was also
negative according to her preliminary report.  In route back
to Coronary Care Unit, the patient was noted to have a sudden
development of subcutaneous emphysema.  A STAT chest x-ray
demonstrated the possibility of pneumomediastinum and a
Pulmonary consult was obtained.  Bronchoscopy was performed
and revealed a small tear in the posterior surface of the
trachea.  The patient had stable hemodynamics with good
oxygenation.  Endotracheal tube cuff was advanced past
laceration with good results.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Atrial fibrillation treated with Coumadin.
2.  Seizure disorder with last episode 19 years ago.  Per
family, seizure episodes are described as decreased
responsiveness, unilateral weakness and aphasia with a
postictal period often lasting five days.
3.  Congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of
45-55%.
4.  Thoracic descending aortic aneurysm approximately 4 cm
and stable.
5.  Status post GCY.
6.  Hypertension.

ALLERGIES:  Phenergan which causes jitters.

MEDICATIONS ON TRANSFER TO CORONARY CARE UNIT:
[**Unit Number **].  Dilantin 200 q.d.
2.  Lopressor 75 b.i.d.
3.  Lasix 40 q.d.
4.  Aspirin 325 q.d.
5.  Lipitor 20 q.d.
6.  Percocet, Tylenol, Colace and Serax prn.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient has a 15 pack year history of
tobacco use.  She quit 20 years ago.  Patient drinks one
drink per day.  Has no other drug use.

FAMILY HISTORY:  The patient's father died of sudden death at
age 56.

PHYSICAL EXAM ON ADMISSION:  Temperature 98.4.  Pulse 102 in
atrial fibrillation.  Blood pressure 121/62 with a mean of
82.  Weight 72 kilograms.  SIMV with total volume of 600,
respirations set at 10, FIO2 of 1.0, pressure support of 20,
PEEP of 5.  Peak/plateau with 35/19 respectively.  Arterial
blood gases 7.34/40/205.  Physical examination:  Generally,
patient was sedated and intubated.  Head, eyes, ears, nose
and throat:  Pupils small but reactive to light.  Neck exam:
Poor exam due to the subcutaneous emphysema; no bruits were
heard.  Lungs:  Positive bowel sounds throughout.
Cardiovascular exam:  Her JV was engorged.  She has a regular
rate, normal S1, S2, 1-2/6 systolic murmur, no S3, S4.
Abdominal exam:  Positive bowel sounds, soft, nondistended.
Extremities:  Trace to no edema in lower extremities, 2+
dorsalis pedis pulses bilaterally.  Neurological exam:
Patient sedated, no reflexes in lower extremities.

LABS ON ADMISSION:  White blood cell count of 11.7,
hematocrit 34.4, platelets 208,000. Sodium 143, potassium
4.5, chloride 99, bicarbonate 20, BUN 40, creatinine 1.1,
glucose 130.  PT 14.1, PTT 25.6, INR 1.3, albumin 3.2,

fibrillation.  Has ST elevations in the inferior leads of
approximately 1 mm, ST depressions and T wave inversions in
V2 through V6 of approximately 1 mm.

Electrocardiogram on [**8-29**]:  Patient still in atrial
fibrillation, ST elevation in the inferior leads of
approximately 2 mm, ST depressions in the lateral leads
approximately 3 mm, T wave inversions in V1 through V6.

Electrocardiogram on [**8-30**]:  No changes.

Electrocardiogram on [**9-4**]:  Patient atrial
fibrillation, has diffuse low voltage, T wave inversions
inferior and anterior lateral leads, resolution of ST changes
in III and aVF.

Electrocardiogram on [**9-5**]:  Showed no changes.

Electrocardiogram on [**9-9**]:  Patient in atrial
fibrillation, poor R wave progression, low voltage, otherwise
no change.

Catheterization laboratory results from [**8-28**]:  2+
mitral regurgitation, ejection fraction of 30%, akinesia of
inferior wall and apex, hypokinesia of inferior and posterior
wall, mid left anterior descending and proximal right
coronary artery occlusion with good collaterals.

Echocardiogram from [**8-31**]:  Ejection fraction of
20-25%, global left ventricular hypokinesis, right
ventricular free wall hypokinesis, 2+ mitral regurgitation,
3+ tricuspid regurgitation.

Echocardiogram from [**9-1**]:  No arteriosclerotic
disease or PFO seen with maneuvers or agitated saline,
otherwise no changes.

Cultures:  Sputum cultures from [**9-2**] and [**9-4**]
grew out Moraxella with heavy growth.  Blood cultures, urine
cultures and catheter tip cultures have all been negative.

Electroencephalogram from [**8-30**] shows markedly slowing
and suppression consistent with wide spread cephalopathy
effecting both corticals and subcortical structures.  No
evidence of ongoing seizures.

Radiology:  Patient had numerous chest x-rays that have been
consistent with bilateral pleural effusions, left greater
than right, which have been resolving over time.  Patient did
have a pneumothorax which did resolve over time.  No
infiltrates have been seen, cardiomegaly, neither mild to no
pulmonary edema has been seen.

Lower extremity noninvasives were performed on [**8-31**]
which showed no deep vein thrombosis.

Head CT was performed on [**8-29**] which showed no acute
lesions seen.

Chest CT angiography was performed on [**8-31**] as
consistent with a left lower lobe lingular and right lower
lobe small PE's.  Patient also had small bilateral pleural
effusions, left anterior pneumothorax and aortic aneurysm
with no change.

MRI/MRA of the head from [**8-29**]:  Preliminary report
stated it was normal.

IMPRESSION:  This is an 87-year-old with past medical history
of atrial fibrillation, hypertension, congestive heart
failure and seizure disorder who presents with mental status
changes, left hemiparesis and respiratory distress requiring
intubation.  Clinical picture and history consistent with
likely small cortical/subcortical right CVA and questionable
seizure activity leading to neurologic disturbances.
Respiratory distress thought to be secondary to PE and
pleural effusions.
