Past Medical History:
Past Oncologic History:
- [**12-13**] developed symptoms of difficulty swallowing and
dysphagia which progressed over several months, saw GI who
performed an EGD and biopsy which demonstrated adenocarcinoma
- [**2110-5-2**] EUS done at [**Hospital1 18**] showed circumferential mass of
malignant appearance at 36-38 cm in the distal esophagus,
causing partial obstruction, staged as T3 due to
pseudopodia-like tumor extension noted beyond the outer
muscularis margin.  [**3-7**] paraesophageal lymph nodes were noted,
with most suspicious being 0.8cm at 38cm in the esophagus.
Repeat biopsies of the mass demonstrated moderately
differentiated adenocarcinoma, invasive into at least the
mucosa, arising in a background of focal intestinal metaplasia
consistent with Barrett's esophagus
- [**2110-5-26**] started neoadjuvant treatment with 5-FU via continuous
infusion over 4 days, Cisplatin (given [**2110-5-27**]) and XRT;
infusion discontinued on day 3 [**2-5**] to chest pain.  Recent cycle
given end of [**6-14**] - similiar symptoms but tolerated
.
Other Past Medical History:
Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus
Cholecystectomy
Appendectomy
Rotator cuff surgery
Hernia repair
Asthma


Social History:
The patient is married and has four children.  He works as a
heating and an air conditioning technician.  He is a lifetime
nonsmoker and does not drink alcohol.


Family History:
Mother died of complications of diabetes.  Father died of
complications of diabetes.  Brothers and sisters have diabetes.
His children are healthy.  There is no cancer in the family.

[**2110-9-2**] UGI:
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of leak. Free passage of contrast from the upper
esophagus to the neoesophagus.
2. Dilution of contrast within a fluid-filled neoesophagus,
somewhat limiting evaluation of this structure.

MACROSCOPIC
Specimen Type:  Esophagogastrectomy.
Specimen Size: Greatest Dimension:  15 cm.  Additional
dimensions:  10.5 cm x 2.5 cm.
Tumor Site:  Distal esophagus (lower thoracic esophagus).
Relationship of Tumor to Esophagogastric Junction:  Tumor
midpoint lies in The distal esophagus and tumor involves the
esophagogastric junction.
Tumor Size: Greatest Dimension:  3.5 cm.  Additional dimensions:

EXTENT OF INVASION
Primary Tumor:  pT1b:  Tumor invades submucosa.
Regional Lymph Nodes:  pN0:  No regional lymph node metastasis;
see comments.
Lymph Nodes

invasive carcinoma.
    Distance of invasive carcinoma from closest margin:  33 mm.
    Specified margin:  Proximal esophageal margin.
    Treatment Effect (applicable to carcinomas treated with
neoadjuvant   therapy):  No definite response identified (grade

tumor infiltration. This could represent treatment effect on a
lymph node totally replaced by tumor.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr [**Known lastname 31**] is a 51M who had a local regionally advanced
esophageal cancer which was T3n2. He underwent chemotherapy and
radiation and had an excellent response by
repeat PET imaging. He presented to the OR on [**2110-8-27**] for
Minimally-invasive esophagectomy, EGD and laparoscopic
jejunostomy tube placement. His operation was without
complication, and he was extubated without difficulty. He
remained in the surgical ICU POD0 and was transferred to the
floor on POD1. His pain was initially well controlled with an
epidural, and once removed on POD1 was well controlled on a
dilaudid PCA, IV toradol, and transitioned to oral pain
medications when he was tolerating clears. He began J-tube feeds
on POD1, with the nutrition service providing relevant
recommendations. He tolerated his feeds well. His NGT was
discontinued on POD4. An UGI study on [**2110-9-2**] did not show
evidence of any anastamotic leak, and therefore his mediastinal
chest tube and [**Doctor Last Name **] were removed on this date (POD6). On POD7
he did complain of increased heartburn with clears, and CXR
showed a slightly enlarged conduit. Given his symptoms, he was
taken back to the OR on [**2110-9-5**] for EGD, dilation of pylorus with
20 mm radial balloon, and inkection of pylorus with 200u Botox.
He tolerated the procedure well, and post-operatively no longer
had heart burn symptoms. His pathology returned T1bN0Mx- 33 mm
margin,perinueral,lmphatic and venous invasion absent. He was
followed by the [**Hospital **] clinic while inpatient given elevated
FSGs while on TF, and should follow up with [**Last Name (un) **] as an
outpatient. He will follow up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] on discharge. VNA
was arranged on discharge to assist him with his tube feeding at
home.
