Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2108**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath, productive cough, fever

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 65 year old woman with COPD and active tobacco
use (50 pack-year history) who presents with three days of
worsening shortness of breath, with fever, productive cough, and
increased home bronchodilator use without relief of symptoms.
She was initially admitted to the ICU, and was subsequently
transferred to the medical floor after management of respiratory
distress and hypoxia.

In the three days prior to admission, the patient notes feeling
like she had a 'cold' with increasing wheezing and shortness of
breath at rest that is further exacerbated by exertion. She
tried escalating nebulizers and inhalers prior to presenting,
with minimal improvement in her symptoms. She states that this
episode is similar to her previous COPD exacerbations, although
she has not required ICU stay in the past. She reports a
temperature to 101F on the night prior to admission, and 100.1
on the morning of admission.  She reported pleuritic chest pain,
although, she denies any chest pressure or tightness and states
that her current episode feels like her prior COPD
exacerbations.

On the day of admission, she presented to her PCP for evaluation
and was noted to be severely dyspneic and appeared dehydrated.
Her vitals were T 99.1, P 108-120, BP 160/80, O2 saturation 84%
on RA. She was noted to have poor air movement with faint
inspiratory and expiratory wheezes and rhonchi. She was sent to
the [**Hospital1 18**] ED for evaluation.

In the ED, initial VS were: 97.7 110 152/64 24 100% on 6L NC. On
exam, she had diffuse wheezes. She was initially stable on 6L NC
O2 but experienced episodes of worsening SOB during which she
desaturated to the low 80s. She was placed on 15L O2
non-rebreather. EKG showed sinus tachycardia, similar to prior.
CXR showed large lung volumes with no acute process. CTA chest
was negative for PE. She was given 60 mg prednisone PO but
vomited and subsequently received solumedrol 125 mg IVP. She was
also given with nebulized inhalers x 3, Levofloxacin 500 mg x1
IV, Zofran 4 mg IVP, and 1L NS IV. She appeared comfortable, was
not using accessory muscles, and was speaking in full sentences.
The patient was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for management of
respiratory distress.

In the ICU, the patient continued to appear stable on
non-rebreather. Vitals were T 96.9 P 110 BP 147/52 RR 28 Sat 96%
on NRB.

Review of systems:  Acute shortness of breath, with productive
cough of 'gray-ish sputum', no nausea or vomiting, no muscle
aches, no abdominal pain, positive fever for the day prior to
admission, without shaking chills.
She endorses anxiety, chronic non-productive cough (sometimes
productive of clear sputum), occassional hot flashes. Patient
did get flu shot this year. Does sometimes get nausea with her
COPD flares, and is developing this now.
(-) Denies chills, night sweats, recent weight loss or gain.
Denies headache, sinus tenderness, rhinorrhea or congestion.
Denies chest pressure, palpitations, or weakness, or lower
extremity edema. Denies nausea, vomiting (other than 1x in ED),
diarrhea, constipation, abdominal pain, or changes in bowel
habits. Denies dysuria, frequency, or urgency. Denies
arthralgias or myalgias. Denies rashes or skin changes.

Physical Exam:
On admission to the ICU
VS: T: 96.9 BP: 138/62 P: 107 R:22 O2: 91 on 6L NC
General: Alert, oriented, no acute distress
HEENT: Sclera anicteric, MM dry, oropharynx clear
Neck: supple, JVP not elevated, no LAD
Lungs: Minimal air movement. Inspiratory and expiratory wheezes
bilaterally in all posterior and anterior fields. No rales or
rhonchi.
CV: Regular rate and rhythm, distant S1 + S2, no murmurs, rubs,
gallops.
Abdomen: soft, non-tender, non-distended, bowel sounds present,
no rebound tenderness or guarding, no organomegaly
GU: no foley
Ext: warm, well perfused, 2+ pulses, no clubbing, cyanosis or
edema

On transfer to the medical floor:
VS: 88% on 6L NC prior to nebulizer, 92% after nebulizer.
BP 110s/60s HR 80s-90s on telemetry.
General: Patient appears comfortable, mild audible wheezing, no
use of accessory muscles. Able to speak short sentences without
distress.
HEENT: dry mucous membranes, no scleral icterus
Neck: No JVD
Lungs: limited air movement, extensive wheezing bilaterally.  No
focal rhonchi but coarse BS bilaterally. No use of accessory
muscles.
Abdomen: positive BS, soft, non-tender, non-distended
Extremities: no pitting edema, overall decreased muscle mass.
Skin: Changes consistent with chronic steroid use, with
decreased turgor pressure.

Pertinent Results:
Imaging:

CXR [**2136-2-13**]: AP upright portable view of the chest was obtained.
The lungs are again hyperinflated, consistent with chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease.  Biapical pleural thickening is
again noted. No focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or
evidence of pneumothorax is seen. The cardiac, mediastinal, and
hilar contours are stable. The cardiac silhouette is not
enlarged. Aortic knob calcification is seen.
IMPRESSION: COPD. No focal consolidation seen.

CTA [**2136-2-13**]:
1. No evidence of acute pulmonary embolism or acute aortic
syndrome.
2. Bibasal small sub 4-mm nodules, similar in size and
appearance to the
prior study. A new right 3 mm lower lobe nodule, is new since
the prior
study. Given the history of breast cancer, recommended a
followup chest CT in three to six months to assess the same.
Findings added to radiology dashboard on [**2136-2-14**].
3. Stable biapical pleural parenchymal scarring.
4. Small hiatal hernia.

Brief Hospital Course:
65 year-old woman admitted with a COPD exacerbation secondary to
an acute infection, in the setting of active tobacco use, known
oxygen-dependent COPD (2L, per son's report), and found to have
hypoxia, leukocytosis, fever and productive cough. She was
initially admitted to the ICU for management of her acute
hypoxia with a non-rebreather mask and IV steroids, and has
responded to nebulizer therapy as well.

Acute exacerbation of COPD: Respiratory distress, wheezing and
productive cough most likely represents an acute exacerbation of
patient's chronic COP
