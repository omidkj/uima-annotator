Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2597**]
Chief Complaint:
Ischemic left foot with gangrene of toes

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
1. Ultrasound-guided imaging, antegrade third order
arteriography with unilateral extremity runoff, incomplete
unsuccessful procedure, corresponding to CPT codes [**Numeric Identifier 23286**],
[**Numeric Identifier 4237**], [**Numeric Identifier 8881**] with a modifier of 53-W851

2. Left below-knee popliteal to distal posterior
tibial artery bypass with non reversed saphenous vein.

3. Amputation of left second and third toes with
debridement.


History of Present Illness:
This is a 77-year-old male that was referred
with dry gangrene of the left second and third toes. The
patient had undergone an attempted intervention at an outside
hospital through his right groin. The patient has no palpable
pulses below the popliteal. Of note, the patient has an
ejection fraction of only 10% and is a significant cardiac
risk of both open as well as endovascular interventions.

INTERPRETATION:

Findings:

LEFT ATRIUM: Moderate LA enlargement. Mild spontaneous echo
contrast in the  body of the LA. Good (>20 cm/s) LAA ejection
velocity. All four pulmonary  veins identified and enter the
left atrium.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Normal RA size. A catheter or
pacing wire is  seen in the RA. No ASD by 2D or color Doppler.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Wall thickness and cavity dimensions were
obtained from 2D  images. Severely dilated LV cavity. Severe
regional LV systolic dysfunction.

LV WALL MOTION: Regional LV wall motion abnormalities include:
basal anterior  - hypo; mid anterior - hypo; basal anteroseptal
- hypo; mid anteroseptal -  hypo; basal inferoseptal - hypo; mid
inferoseptal - hypo; basal inferior -  hypo; mid inferior -
hypo; basal anterolateral - hypo; mid anterolateral -  hypo;
anterior apex - hypo; septal apex - hypo; inferior apex - hypo;
apex -  hypo; remaining LV segments contract normally.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Moderately dilated RV cavity. Moderate global
RV free wall  hypokinesis.

AORTA: Normal ascending aorta diameter. Normal descending aorta
diameter.  Simple atheroma in descending aorta.

AORTIC VALVE: Three aortic valve leaflets. Severely
thickened/deformed aortic  valve leaflets. Severe AS (AoVA
<0.8cm2). Trace AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Moderately thickened mitral valve leaflets. Mild
mitral annular  calcification. Moderate thickening of mitral
valve chordae. Mild to moderate  ([**1-11**]+) MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets with trivial
TR.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflets
with
physiologic PR.

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

Conclusions:
PRE-BYPASS: The left atrium is moderately dilated. Mild
spontaneous echo
contrast is seen in the body of the left atrium. No atrial
septal defect is  seen by 2D or color Doppler. The left
ventricular cavity is severely dilated.  There is severe
regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with akinetic
inferior,septal and lateral walls.in the basal and mif\d
myocardial segments.  The remaining left ventricular segments
contract normally. The right  ventricular cavity is moderately
dilated. There is moderate global right  ventricular free wall
hypokinesis. There are simple atheroma in the descending
thoracic aorta. There are three aortic valve leaflets. The
aortic valve  leaflets are severely thickened /deformed. There
is severe aortic valve  stenosis (area <0.8cm2). Trace aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve  leaflets are moderately
thickened. There is moderate thickening of the mitral  valve
chordae. Mild to moderate ([**1-11**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is  no pericardial effusion. A TEE procedure related
complication occurred (see  comments for details).

CHEST PORT. LINE PLACEMENT

Reason: 48cm SL L basilic PICC placed; please determine tip
location

COMPARISON: [**2118-9-24**].

FINDINGS: Interval placement of left PICC with its tip
projecting at the level of the proximal SVC.

Cardiomegaly is again noted. Interval worsening of bilateral
pleural effusions and bibasilar atelectasis. There is
engorgement of the pulmonary vasculature with increased
interstitial markings consistent with pulmonary edema, worse
since prior exam. There is no pneumothorax. The osseous
structures are unchanged. Right-sided dual-chamber pacemaker is
unchanged.Interval withdrawal of right-sided Swan-Ganz catheter.

IMPRESSION:
1. Interval placement of left PICC with its tip projecting at
the [**Last Name (un) **] of the proximal SVC.
2. Interval worsening of bilateral pleural effusions, bibasilar
atelectasis, and mild to moderate pulmonary edema.
3. Cardiomegaly.
4. Interval withdrawal of right-sided Swan-Ganz catheter.
