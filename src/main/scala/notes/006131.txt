Brief Hospital Course:
Pt was admitted on [**9-5**] and transferred to the TSICU. She was
intubated for her declining mental status. Neurosurgery was
consulted and it was felt that non-operative management of her
Subdural hematoma was indicated. Her scalp laceration was packed
and hemostasis was achieved. She required significant fluid and
blood resusitation. MRI of her C spine revealed no injury of the
C spine. Repeat head Ct showed worsening of her subdural and a
new R parietotemporal CVA as well as a L parietotemporal
infarct. Neurology was consulted and suggested Increasing her
cerebral perfusion with pressors. She was given a complete
course of Kefzol for her open scalp laceration. She was started
on TF through an NGT and was quickly advanced to goal. Dilantin
was started for seizure prophylaxsis however it was felt that
this could be stopped due to her injury and no seizure activity
during her hospitalization. PT was consulted and continued to
work with her throughout her hospital stay. Attempts at
extubation failed and a discussion was caried out with her
health care proxy. It was decided that she would undergo a
Tracheostomy and PEG at the bedside, which she tolerated well.
Repeat CXR showed worsening pulmonary edema associated with her
significant fluid resusitation and she was started on Lasix for
diuresis. Also, sputum cultures grew G-R and she completed a 14
day course of abx. Repeat CXR continued to show RUL
consolidation. She underwent a bronchoscopy that showed minimal
secretions. Pt continued to improve from a neurological
standpoint and was moving all ext and tracking with her eyes at
time of discharge. Prior to D/C speech and swallow was consulted
for Passy Muir valve placement. They felt a smaller sized trach
would be neccessary for valve placement. After that she could
undergo a swallow evaluation to assess her ability. She is
currently been off antibiotics and tolerating Trach Mask for
extended periods of time.
