Brief Hospital Course:
This is a [**Age over 90 **] year old female with unclear medical history,
presenting with 3-4d weakness, nausea/vomiting, decreased PO
intake, bilateral pleural effusions, cardiomegaly, new atrial
fibrillation, in the setting of 10d antibiotics for left toe
ulcer.

# Weakness/mental status - Workup for an infectious source has
been negative. She had one fever in the ED however remained
afebrile since. Her CXR was quite limited, and consistent with
mild, CHF. Repeat UA was not consistent with UTI. The patient
had negative caridac markers for MI. CT head was negative. Urine
legionella was negative. Urine culture showed yeast, and DFA for
influenza was negative. Antibiotics were held. The patient did
increase her PO intake throughout the admission and according to
the family was at baseline status upon discharge.

# Atrial fibrillation/tachycardia - This appeared to be new
onset afib. as the patient has had visiting nursing and her
increased heart rate was noticed during one of these visits. Her
rate was controlled with Lopressor. Her TSH was normal, and a
TTE showed moderate AS but no other structural disease. She was
discharged on 50mg TID Metoprolol. She was not started on
anticoagulation, CHADs = 2 (age, likely CHF), given her age and
overall condition.

# Acute renal failure (ARF) - Her baseline creatinine is
unknown. Her CRE was 1.2 on admission, and on the day of
discharge was 1.3. It was felt that due to the Afib., s
