History of Present Illness:
History of Present Illness: This is a 60 year old female with a
history of auto immune mediated myelitis initiated on IVIG on
[**2150-10-9**]. She presented to [**Hospital3 4107**] with 2 day history of
headache initially responsive to Advil. Yesterday she awoke with
severe headache and chills, with the development of nausea and
emesis. She also had blurry vision. Due to the severity of her
symptoms she called her neurologist who recommended ED
evaluation. At [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] an LP was performed which showed 60 red
cells and 600WBCs in tube 4, Glucose 62 and protein 114 with
negative gram stain. Fluid was clear and colorless. A head CT
was negative and a CXR showed a RLL infiltrate. She was given a
dose of vancomycin and anzithromycin and sent to [**Hospital1 **] for further
management given history of multiple antibiotic allergies.

In the [**Hospital1 **] ED Initial VS were T 97.7 HR 80 bp 97/57 02 98% RA rr
20. Blood cultures were sent. She was noted to have nuchal
rigidity and She was given acyclovir and tylenol. ID was
consulted with recommendation for IV bactrim and IV meropenem in
ICU setting.


Typically flares once a year with autoimmune myeltis, with 2
flares this year. Over last month symptoms have worsened with
joint pain and neuropathy, weakness, constipation, poor apetite.
Got IVIG x 1 on [**2150-10-9**] with plan for 4 additional treatments
weekly with decadron, zofran given. Muscle weakness improved but
2 days later pt had worsened headache with photophobia, with
nausea and non bloody emesis. Had neck stiffness yesterday. No
recent travel.

Brief Hospital Course:
60 year old woman with history of auto immune mediated myeltiis
presenting with headache now with LP suggestive of early
bacterial meningitis vs aseptic meningitis admitted to [**Hospital1 **] for
antibiotic desensitization.

Acute Issues:
# Meningitis: On admission she had nuchal rigidity and headache
with symptoms evolving following exposure to IVIG, with
suspected adverse reaction to IVIG. Additionally, aseptic
meningitis following IVIG infusion has been reported. Her
initial LP could also reflect an early bacterial meningitis vs
viral meningitis. Although the gram stain was negative,
antibiotic initiation was recommended by the infectious disease
team, as some organisms such as neisseria can be slow to
culture. She received IV acyclovir, vancomycin, bactrim and
underwent desensitization to ceftriaxone. HSV PCR was requested
from OSH LP. She did develop throat swelling at higher dose of
ceftriaxone and required IV  solumedrol, benadryl and
famotidine. The patient subsequently tolerated ceftriaxone. She
was transferred to the floor on HOD 2. HSV PCR was negative at
OSH and thus acyclovir was discontinued. The ID team recommended
a repeat LP and this was done. It showed no signs of infectious
etiology with only 7 WBCs, no organisms or polys, and negative
gram stain. Antibiotics were discontinued at this time. The
patient was observed for 12 hours after and was without symptoms
or fever. She was discharged home with the thought that the
meningitis was aseptic and secondary to adverse reaction to
IVIG.

# Autoimmune mediated myelitis: Pt had acute flare of her
myeltis with IVIG given. She had improvement of myelitis
symptoms with IVIG but development of nausea and headache
subsequently as well as aseptic meningitis picture, most likely
an adverse reaction to IVIG. This was discussed by her
neurologist given that she is planned for weekly IVIG. The
patient was scheduled to follow up with her outpatient
neurologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 9449**] for further treatment.

Chronic Issues:
# Asthma: home advair was continued.

# Glaucoma: continued eye drops

# h/o seziures: home clonazepam 1.5mg [**Hospital1 **] with additional 1 mg
dose at 2 pm was continued.

Transitional Issues:
- Patient will follow up with outpatient neurologist regarding
futher care of autoimmune myelitis.
- CSF culture pending.
- Blood cultures pending.

Medications on Admission:
Klonopin 1.5 am, 1mg at 2pm then 1.5mg qpm
Xalitan 1 drop each eye bedtime
Azopt L eye 1drop three times a day
Advair 250/110 1 puff [**Hospital1 **]

Allergies: Ceclor-anaphylaxis
Cefoxitin- anaphylaxis
clindamycin- rash
