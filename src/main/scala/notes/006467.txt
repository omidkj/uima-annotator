Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted and went directly to the operating room
on [**2132-10-13**] after imaging revealed a ruptured splenic abscess.
Briefly he was admitted to the trauma ICU post-operatively in
septic shock.  Once this resolved he was transferred to the
floor.  He had to be transferred back to the ICU for respiratory
distress.  His hospital course will be detailed by body systems.

.
Neuro: Immediately post-operatively and during his reintubation
he was maintained on sedation while intubated.  When the
sedation was weaned he was following commmands and has an intact
neuro exam and was able to be extubated.  He currently has good
pain control on oxycodone liquid via his dobhoff tube and
intravenous dilaudid for breakthrough pain.  He was expressing
signs of depression.  Geriatrics was consulted and they did not
want to start an antidepressant during his acute
hospitalization.  He was nonetheless started on fluoxetine and
has since been in better spirits.
.
Cardiovascular:  Post-operatively he was in septic shock and on
multiple vasopressors.  These were able to be weaned off.  He
then had persistent tachycardia and this was found to be a-fib
with rapid ventricular response.  He was started on Lopressor
with good rate control.  He has since converted to normal sinus
rhythm.  An Echocardiogram revealed no intracardiac thrombus.
He was able to be transferred to the floor with telemetry.  On
the floor he developed respiratory distress necessitating a
transfer back to the ICU.  He was ultimately intubated and found
to be in shock requiring multiple vasopressors to maintain an
adequate BP.  This was presumed septic shock.  He was stablized
and a CT scan showed an intra-abdominal abscess in the splenic
bed.  This abscess was drained by interventional radiology.
This abscess grew out multi-drug resistant Pseudomonas.  After
source control was obtained his hemodynamics normalized and he
was able to be weaned off of pressors.  He currently is
normotensive with SBP in the 110-120's with a HR in the 60-80s
on lopressor.
.
Pulmonary:  As stated earlier he was intubated for a number of
days post-operatively and then extubated.  He did develop
respiratory distress and subsequently had to be reintubated.  He
was unable to wean from the ventilator during his second
intubation.  A family meeting was held.  All parties involved
agreed that a tracheostomy would benefit Mr. [**Known lastname **].  A bedside
percutaneous tracheostomy was performed on [**2132-10-31**].  He was
then able to be weaned to trach mask.  He was evaluated by
speech and swallow for a PMV but he was found to have copious
secretions so he continues on trach mask.  He doe shave a
history of COPD so his PCO2 is in the 50s at baseline.  This was
exacerbated by lasix so his diuresis was changed to diamox and
then eventually stopped.  He should have a repeat speech and
swallow to evaluate for a PMV.
.
Gastrointestinal:  Tube feeds were initially started via an NGT.
 He was tolerating goal rate tube feeds.  A swallow evaluation
was performed and it was recommended that he take nectar
thickened liquids and soft solids.  His NGT was removed and he
was transfered to the floor and the above mentioned diet.
During his reintubation, he was given a Dobhoff tube for tube
feeds.  He is tolerating goal rate tube feeds with bowel
movements.  He will need another swallow evaluation to see if he
can take POs.  He had two JP drains placed in the splenic bed
that were removed on POD13.  The character of the output was
alwasy serosanguinous and a JP amylase was checked; this was
initially 240 and then decreased to 43 prior to removal.  The
medial drain site then began to have fecculent output.  A small
drainage catheter was placed into the drain site and then placed
to bulb suction.  The drainage continued to be fecculent.  A
