Service:  CARDIAC SURGERY

HI[**Last Name (STitle) 2710**]OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 59-year-old gentleman
who presented to an outside hospital in [**2112-5-5**] with a
dry cough, found to be in atrial flutter.  Further workup
revealed endocarditis with vegetations on his mitral valve
and severe mitral regurgitation.  Subsequent blood cultures
were positive for corynebacterium.  The patient was treated
with IV antibiotics and referred to Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] for
replacement of his mitral valves.  Cardiac catheterization
showed mild pulmonary hypertension and no significant
coronary artery disease.  Echocardiogram showed an ejection
fraction of greater than 55%, mildly thickened aortic
leaflets, trace aortic insufficiency, mitral valve leaflets
mildly thickened, moderate sized vegetations on the anterior
leaflet of the mitral valve, 4+ mitral regurgitation and 1+
tricuspid regurgitation.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Hypertension.
2. Hypercholesterolemia.
3. Rheumatoid arthritis.
4. History of bacterial endocarditis.
5. Mitral valve prolapse.
6. Recent onset of atrial flutter.

PREOPERATIVE MEDICATIONS:
1. Sulindac.
2. Plaquenil.
3. Arrova.
4. Prednisone prn.
5. Lipitor.
6. Lasix.
7. Toprol XL.
8. Lisinopril.
9. Amiodarone.

ALLERGIES:  Penicillin and sulfa, both of which cause rash.

PREOPERATIVE PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  This is a well-nourished
and well-developed male in no apparent distress, appears
slightly younger than stated age.  Skin is without rashes or
lesions.  HEENT:  Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to
light and accommodation.  Extraocular movements are intact.
Normal mucosa, normal dentition.  Neck is supple without
jugular venous distention.  No thyromegaly.  Chest was clear
to auscultation bilaterally, no wheezes, rales, or rhonchi.
Heart is regular, rate, and rhythm, S1, S2 with 3/6 systolic
murmur heard best at apex, no rubs.  Abdomen is soft,
nontender, nondistended, no guarding, rebound, or rigidity.
Extremities are warm, no edema, no cyanosis.  Cranial nerves
II through XII are grossly intact.  No motor or sensory
deficits.

HO[**Last Name (STitle) **] COURSE:  The patient was admitted to [**Hospital1 346**] on [**2112-7-25**] for a minimally
invasive mitral valve replacement with Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) **].
Patient had a 33 mm mosaic porcine valve placed through a
minimally invasive surgery.  Patient tolerated the procedure
well.  Please see operative note for further details.  The
patient was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit on a
Neo-Synephrine drip.

Patient was weaned the next day from mechanical ventilation
on his first postoperative evening.  The Neo-Synephrine was
weaned.  In the afternoon of postoperative day #1, the
patient converted from sinus rhythm to atrial flutter, which
he tolerated well.  Patient's chest tubes were removed
without incident.

Patient was transferred from the Intensive Care Unit to the
regular floor on postoperative day #2.  On postoperative day
#3, the patient ambulated with Physical Therapy and was able
to walk 500 feet and climb one flight of stairs, was cleared
for discharge to home from a Physical Therapy standpoint.

On postoperative day #3, the Electrophysiology Service was
consulted for patient's atrial flutter.  Their recommendation
was for the patient to be taken to the Catheterization
Laboratory for a flutter ablation and cardioversion.  Patient
was on Heparin infusion at this time for anticoagulation.
The patient was taken to the Catheterization Laboratory on
postoperative day #4, where he underwent A-flutter ablation
and conversion into sinus rhythm with first degree A-V block.
The patient tolerated the procedure well.

The Electrophysiology Service recommended discontinuing the
patient's amiodarone after the flutter ablation due to his
age, they felt that it would be better if the patient were on
an anti-arrhythmic with fewer long-term side-effects.
However, since the patient's electrocardiogram at that time
showed sinus rhythm, first degree A-V block with a right
bundle branch block plus or minus a left anterior fascicular
block, it was decided that patient would not be placed on any
anti-arrhythmics at this time and will follow up with his
cardiologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1295**] in one month for further
monitoring of his rhythm and further decisions about his
rhythm would be made by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1295**].

It is also recommended that if the patient required further
anti-arrhythmic therapy, the patient should be considered for
a permanent pacer for his A-V node conduction delay.  The
patient was restarted on Heparin and Coumadin was begun for
anticoagulation.

By postoperative day #8, patient's INR was therapeutic at
2.2, and the patient was cleared for discharge to home.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Pulse 82 sinus rhythm with first
degree A-V block, blood pressure 100/64, respiratory rate 14
and on room air oxygen saturation 96%.  Neurologically, the
patient is alert, awake, oriented x3.  Heart is regular,
rate, and rhythm without murmur or rub.  Lungs are clear
bilaterally without wheezes, rales, or rhonchi.  Abdomen is
soft, nontender, nondistended.  Patient is tolerating a
regular diet.  The incision in his right chest is clean and
dry without erythema.  The Steri-Strips are intact.

LABORATORY DATA:  White blood cell count 7.4, hematocrit
31.4, platelet count 319.  Sodium 143, potassium 4.2,
chloride 109, bicarb 27, BUN 16, creatinine 1.0, glucose 88.
PT 18.2, INR of 2.2.  Patient has no peripheral edema.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1. Status post minimally invasive mitral valve replacement
with a 33 mm mosaic valve.
2. Postoperative atrial fibrillation/atrial flutter.
3. Status post atrial flutter/ablation.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1. Colace 100 mg po bid.
2. Zantac 150 mg po bid.
3. Aspirin 81 mg po q day.
4. Percocet 5/325 1-2 tablets po q4h prn.
5. Lipitor 20 mg po q day.
6. Coumadin 2.5 mg po on [**8-2**] and [**8-3**].

INSTRUCTIONS:  The patient is to followup with Dr.[**Name (NI) 39613**]
[**Hospital 197**] Clinic on [**8-4**] for PT/INR and further Coumadin
dosing.  The patient is not being discharged home on any beta
blockers or anti-arrhythmics.  Patient is to followup with
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1295**] in two weeks, and at that time patient will be
evaluated for initiation of this therapy.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Good.

FO[**Last Name (STitle) **]:  The patient is to followup with Dr.[**Name (NI) 39613**]
