brain and cervical spine metastases, status post XRT and recent
irinotecan/bevacizumab presented after fall at home.
.
# PCP: [**Name10 (NameIs) **] also presented with productive coughs and was
found to be hypoxic. Chest CTA was negative for pulmonary
embolism but was notable for bilateral airspace opacities. She
underwent a bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage positive
for Pneumocystis jirovecii. Before culture came back, she had
already been started on TMP/SMX DS 2 tablets q8h and her
dexamethasone was increased from 4 mg qam/ 2 mg qpm to 4 mg IV
q8h. Dexamethasone was used because of CNS metastases. She had
initially been started on levofloxacin, which was discontinued
when the diagnosis of PCP was made. After 30 hours of treatment
the patient required increased oxygen supplementation, from 2L
to 4L. She became more somnolent. ABG was 7.54/26/66. CXR
revealed worsened bilateral infiltrates. Due to her clinical
deterioration she was transferred to the ICU. The patient
continued to deteriorate rapidly and expired on [**2182-4-26**].
