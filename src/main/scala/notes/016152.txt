Reports
.
BRIEF HISTORY:   [**Age over 90 **] year old male with a history of a thoracic
aorta
aneurysm repair and 2 vessel CABG in [**2107**] and HF with preserved
EF
coming in with increased right and left sided heart failure
symptoms. He
was referred for diagnostic coronary angiography.

INDICATIONS FOR CATHETERIZATION:  CHF, Coronary artery disease

PROCEDURE: [**2117-6-25**]
Left Heart Catheterization: was performed by percutaneous entry
of the
right femoral artery, using a 4 French JL4 catheter, advanced to

the ascending aorta through a 4 French introducing sheath.
Coronary Angiography: was performed in multiple projections
using a 4
French JL4 and a 4 French JR4 catheter, with manual contrast
injections.
Graft Angiography: of 1 saphenous vein bypass graft was
performed using
a 4 French ARII Modified catheter, with manual contrast
injections.
Arterial Conduit Angiography:  of a left internal mammary artery
graft
was performed using a preformed [**Female First Name (un) 899**] catheter, with manual
contrast
injections.
Supravalvular Aortography: was performed in the 30 degrees [**Doctor Last Name **]
projection, using 40 ml of contrast injected at 20 ml/sec,
through the
angled pigtail catheter.
Conscious Sedation:  was provided with appropriate monitoring
performed by
a member of the nursing staff.

COMMENTS:
1. Coronary angiogrpahy revealed the LMCA to be free of disease.
The LAD
had mild non obstrcutive disease. The left circumflex artery had
a
discrete 50% narrowing in the distal vessel. The OM1 was totally

occluded. The RCA was normal.
2. Arterial conduit angiography revelaed a widely patent
LIMA-LAD graft.
3. Aortography was performed in an attempt to locate the SVG
graft to
the OM1. This revealed an ascending aortic tube graft from the
prior
thoracic aortic aneurysm repair.
4. Venous conduit angiography revelaed a patent SVG-OM1 graft.
6. LV filling pressures were elevated with LVEDP of 22

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. One vessel native coronary artery disease.
2. Patent LIMA-LAD and SVG-OM1 grafts
3. Elevated LV filling pressures
.
EKG [**2117-6-25**]:Ventricularly paced rhythm. It is difficult to
assess the atrial rhythm. Compared to the previous tracing of
[**2115-1-3**] ventricularly paced rhythm is unchanged. However, prior
sinus rhythm is no longer present.
