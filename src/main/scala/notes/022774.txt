Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2485**]
Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
NONE

History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **] y/o h/o lung adenocarcinoma s/p lobectomy, diabetes, htn, CAD
who was recently treated for RLL PNA at [**Location (un) 745**] [**Location (un) 3678**],
completed course with moxifloxacin on [**6-23**], she had a right
pleural at that time and she refused workup with a
thoracentesis. She also had a S&S study which she did not
perform well on and was places on thickened diet for aspiration
concern. Since that time period she has been intermittently on
oxygen and there is concern she may be chronically aspirating
given she is prone to choke with eating. Today she was
transferred to [**Hospital 100**] rehab where she c/o dyspnea and reportedly
had oxygen sats 70% on room air. Patient had also not been
eating or drinking much in last 3-4 days due to decreased
appetite. Patient is confirmed DNR/DNI.
In the ED patient is afebrile, HR 88, SBP 83/42, 91% room air,
100% on NRB, patient was given 2 liters normal saline with good
response in her SBP to 110s, also received vanco, levo, and
zosyn and was admitted to ICU for further monitoring.
ROS: + dysphagia, productive cough last 3 days, decreased
appetite, minimal PO intake, weakness
CXR showed possible bilobar aspiration, small effusions.

Portable CXR
SEMI-UPRIGHT AP RADIOGRAPH OF THE CHEST: The lung volumes are
low with elevation of the right hemidiaphragm and moderate
bilateral bronchovascular crowding. Additionally, there is a
patchy opacity at the bilateral lower lobes could reflect
atelectasis versus aspiration. Pleural effusions are small.
Please note that the fourth posterolateral rib is incompletely
visualized, correlate with history of prior thoracotomy. Right
chest wall pacer device with right atrial and ventricular leads
in standard location is noted. There is aortic knob
calcifications.

IMPRESSION:
1. Pleural effusions are small.
2. Fourth posterolateral rib discontinuity could reflect prior
surgical defect from a thoracotomy; clinical/surgical
correlation is recommended.

CTA CHEST [**2183-7-2**]
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
2. Large simple right pleural effusion with complete collapse of
the right
lower lobe.
3. Ground-glass opacity with patchy consolidation in the left
lower lobe is
consistent with pneumonia with small parapneumonic left
effusion.
4. Extensive centrilobular emphysema.
5. Adenopathy as described and long-segment stenosis of the left

branchiocephalic vein and SVC, with prominent thoracic wall
collaterals.



Brief Hospital Course:
[**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 16949**] was a [**Age over 90 **] y/o F MMP including CAD, DM, h/o lung
adenocarcinoma s/p lobectomy who presented with dyspnea and ARF.
 Patient likely had an aspiration pneumonia.  She had failed
speech and swallow evaluation recently after repeated
hospitalizations for PNA.  She was treated with broad spectrum
antibiotics.  Her respiratory status was supported with
supplemental oxygen.  She continued to have difficulty with
clearing secretions and high oxygen requirements.  She developed
worsening respiratory distress, tachycardia and hypotension.
After discussion with the patient's son, it was determined that
the patient should be treated with comfort measures only.
Medications were withdrawn with the exception of a morphine drip
titrated to comfort. She passed away on [**2183-7-3**] at 11:20 AM from
cardiopulmonary arrest. The patient's son was notified of her
death.
