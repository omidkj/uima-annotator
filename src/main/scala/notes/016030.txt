Chief Complaint:
Respiratory Failure
Afib w/ RVR
Pleural Effusion

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Central line
Arterial line
Endotracheal intubation

History of Present Illness:
89M with a chronic nonhealing LLE venous stasis ulcer transfered
from [**Hospital3 **] s/p a complicated course notable for
complete opacification of the L lung, new Afib with RVR, and
respiratory failure. For the past several months he has reported
to his daughter a funny sensation in his ears at times, but no
chest pain, palpitations, SOB, DOE, or other symptoms. He has
been losing weight and not eating as much. For the past week or
so he has had increasing malaise and complained about his
chronic LLE ulcer. Ultimately his daughter convinced him to call
his doctor, and he was referred to the ED at [**Hospital3 **]. At
[**Hospital1 **] he was noted to have increased erythema and exudate
around his chronic LLE ulcer. His initial ECG showed Afib with
RVR. A chest Xray showed complete opacification of the L lung
field. He was empirically started on vancomycin for his LLE
ulcer in the ED. Given his multiple active medical issues, he
was admitted to Medicine for management. The following day he
underwent a diagnostic thoracentesis. Analysis of the fluid
showed LDH 114, amylase of 69, and Tprotein of 4.0 consistent
with an exudate. Several hours after the procedure he was noted
to be hypoxic. CXR showed re-opacification of the L lung. He was
intubated for hypoxic respiratory failure. A subsequent bronch
showed thick, dark sputum. His L lung field remained
persistently opacified and he remained intubated for respiratory
failure. After several days without improvement he was
transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.

reactive mesothelial cells in a background of abundant
polymorphous lymphocytes, favor reactive.

Bronch [**9-11**]:

  NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.

  No fungal organisms or viral cytopathic effect identified.

  NEGATIVE FOR CARCINOMA.

  Mesothelial cells, lymphocytes, histiocytes, and blood.

Imaging:

[**2167-9-10**] TTE:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with normal cavity size and global systolic function
(LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall
motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. There is no
ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and
free wall motion are normal. The aortic root is mildly dilated
at the sinus level. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly
thickened (?#). No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is
normal. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: poor technical quality due to patient's body
habitus. Left ventricular function is probably normal, a focal
wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. The right
ventricle is not well seen but is probably normal. No pathologic
valvular abnormality seen.

[**2167-9-10**] CT Chest without contrast:
Dense pericardial calcification likely representing previous
pericardial TB,
large bilateral pleural effusions, worse on the left, with
associated
extensive compressive atelectasis, ascites and likely cirrhosis.
The normal
sized atrium is incongruous with the constellation of pulmonary,
pericardial
and abdominal findings that suggest right heart failure due to
constrictive
pericarditis. An echocardiogram may help clarify whether right
heart failure
and restrictive physiology is present.

The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.


[**2167-9-11**] Abdominal US
1. Cirrhotic liver without concerning focal lesion. Large amount
of ascites
and moderate right pleural effusion is noted.

2. Mild gallbladder wall edema is likely due to third spacing.
No evidence of
acute cholecystitis.

3. Portal triads are slightly echogenic, likely due to liver
hypoechogenicity. These findings may be seen in hepatitis.
Clinical
correlation is advised.

[**2167-9-15**] TTE
IMPRESSION: There is a small filamentous mass on the mitral
valve associated with mild mitral regurgitation and a focal area
of thickening on the mitral valve leaflet, presenting a probable
vegetation; however, a loose chordae cannot be ruled out and
this is unlikely to be a fungal vegetation

[**2167-9-19**] Portable Abdomen
IMPRESSION: Nasogastric tube placement as described. It is
somewhat high,
apparently reaching below the diaphragm, as before.

Brief Hospital Course:
89M with an infected chronic LLE venous stasis ulcer, new Afib
with RVR, a large L side pleural effusion, and hypoxic
respiratory failure transfered from an OSH for further
management.

Hypoxic respiratory failure /  Right & Left pleural effusion /
Left pneumothorax: The patient was transferred from an OSH
intubated/sedated. Routine blood gases were drawn and the
patient remained well ventilated and oxygenated. The etiology of
his respiratory failure was unclear but was initially thought to
be due to PNA vs. persistent effusions. The patient was
empirically treated with Vanc/Pip/Tazo and transitioned to
Vanc/Flagyl/Cefepime for a total antibiotic course of 10 days,
ending on [**2167-9-14**]. OSH thoracentesis showed an exudative
effusion. Recurrence of the effusion was thought to be due to
re-expansion pulmonary edema vs. diffusion of ascites across the
diaphragm. Left sided thoracosto
