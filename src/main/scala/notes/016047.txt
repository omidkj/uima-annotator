Admission Date:  [**2139-10-28**]       Discharge Date:  [**2139-11-7**]

Date of Birth:   [**2069-4-14**]       Sex:  M

Service:  MICU-TULLI

CHIEF COMPLAINT:   Transferred from outside hospital.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:   This is a 70 year old male with
a history of coronary artery disease, aortic stenosis (aortic
valve area 0.99, with a gradient of 68), paroxysmal atrial
fibrillation, and left lobe lung cancer status post left
pneumonectomy.  He presented to the outside hospital on
[**2139-10-20**] with a chief complaint of shortness of
breath and dyspnea on exertion and productive cough.  The
patient had been diagnosed with pneumonia on [**2139-10-9**], and
started a steroid and Levaquin.

The patient had completed the course of steroid and the
symptoms returned.  The patient went to the Emergency
Department in [**Hospital 4415**] where a chest x-ray
showed right lower lobe infiltrate.  The patient was treated
as congestive heart failure with Nitroglycerin, lasix and
Bi-PAP with chest PT.  The patient's oxygen saturations
dropped and the decision was made to intubate.

CBC showed white blood cell count of 26.8 with a differential
of 83% neutrophils, 10% bands.  The sputum culture eventually
grew Pneumococcus.  The patient was started on Timentin and
Vancomycin which was subsequently changed to Kefzol and
Zithromax.  The patient was extubated on [**10-23**], and
transferred to the floor where he desaturated and required
Bi-PAP.  The attending physician requested transfer to [**Hospital1 1444**].  A Swan-Ganz was placed at
the outside hospital on [**2139-10-28**] and showed a pulmonary
capillary wedge pressure of 22.   The patient was diuresed
two liters with symptomatic relief.  The patient was
re-intubated and transported to [**Hospital1 188**].

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Left lung cancer status post pneumonectomy.
2.  Coronary artery disease status post percutaneous
transluminal coronary angioplasty in [**2129**].
3.  Prostate cancer status post radiation.
4.  Osteoarthritis.
5.  Hypertension.
6.  Hypothyroidism.
7.  Aortic stenosis.

SOCIAL HISTORY:   The patient quit smoking 20 years ago; has

children.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:   Blood pressure 126/51; pulse 84.  The
patient is a frail appearing elderly male, intubated, alert
and oriented times three, in no apparent acute distress.
HEENT reveals no icterus, no pallor.  Mucous membranes were
moist.  Neurological examination shows cranial nerves II
through XII grossly intact.  No focal neurological deficits.
Cardiovascular is regular rate and rhythm, positive III/Vi
holosystolic murmur which radiates to the neck bilaterally
and to the left axilla.  There is positive jugular venous
distention, positive peripheral pitting edema.  No bruits.
Pulmonary examination reveals no breath sounds on the left
and scattered expiratory wheezes on the right with increased
breath sounds anteriorly.  Abdominal examination shows a
soft, nontender, nondistended abdomen with normal bowel
sounds.

LABORATORY:  Pertinent data on admission was white blood cell
count of 11.9, hematocrit 33.0, platelets 174, neutrophils
94%, digoxin level 1.0.  PT 14.8, PTT 27.8, INR 1.5.
Urinalysis was negative.  Sodium 147, potassium 3.9, chloride
101, bicarbonate 40, BUN 56, creatinine 0.9, glucose 206,
calcium 7.8, phosphorus 4.1, magnesium 2.3.

EKG showed atrial fibrillation at outside hospital.
Swan-Ganz catheter showed a central venous pressure of 4.0.
Pulmonary artery pressure of 30 to 45 over 10 to 17.
Systemic vascular resistance, [**2045**].  Pulmonary capillary
wedge pressure between 6 and 11.  Cardiac output 4.36.

Chest x-ray obtained here shows a decreased right sided
effusion compared to chest x-ray obtained at outside
hospital.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  ATRIAL FIBRILLATION:  The patient's heart rate alternated
between atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response,
atrial fibrillation with a controlled rate, normal sinus
rhythm and sinus tachycardia.  The patient was rate
controlled with Diltiazem.  Because Diltiazem caused the
patient to become excessively bradycardic (in the 30s), it
was felt that the patient should be rate controlled, but that
a pacemaker should be placed to prevent excessive
bradycardia.

The patient remained in normal sinus rhythm most of the time
but had several episodes of atrial fibrillation with a rapid
ventricular response at a rate of 140.  During each of these
episodes, intravenous Diltiazem was pushed and was successful
in controlling the patient's rate.  He would become
symptomatic with shortness of breath when he would go into
atrial fibrillation but these symptoms abated with rate
control.

On hospital day six, the patient underwent pacemaker
placement.  He tolerated this well and there were no
complications.  Diltiazem dose was eventually increased to
240 mg q. day of sustained release and Dofetilide was started
after pacemaker placement.  The patient was kept for three
days in-house to be monitored while Dofetilide therapy was
initiated.  He tolerated Dofetilide well.

On the evening of the second day of Dofetilide, the patient
developed a one asymptomatic 32-beat run of ventricular
tachycardia.  This was felt not to be due to Dofetilide so
much as to the patient's structural heart disease, but the
dose of Dofetilide was decreased.

2.  AORTIC STENOSIS:  After load reduction was achieved
initially with Losartan 50 mg p.o. q. day with intravenous
Hydralazine being used for acute blood pressure elevations.
Eventually, the patient was put on Losartan 100 mg p.o. q.
day and Hydralazine was no longer necessary for blood
pressure control.  The patient's aortic stenosis is not at [**Doctor Last Name **]
level of severity which would necessitate aortic valve
replacement.

3.  DYSPNEA:  Because of the patient's elevated pulmonary
artery pressure and significant lower extremity edema, he was
felt to be volume overloaded with respect to total body
volume.  However, because of the patient's sinus tachycardia,
urine sodium of 20, urine osmolality of greater than 900 and
increased BUN to creatinine ratio of about 50:1 and serum
sodium of greater than 150, the patient was felt to be
intravascularly depleted.  Chest x-ray and auscultation
revealed no signs of overt pulmonary failure.  The patient
was also able to maintain his saturations.  So it was decided
to best mobilize the patient's fluid by placing compression
stockings on his legs and giving him Lasix 40 mg
intravenously q. day.  He was encouraged to take p.o. fluids.
The patient did diurese well with improvement in his
shortness of breath and his creatinine remained stable with
resolution of his BUN to creatinine ratio.

His dyspnea was also felt to be at least partly because of
his chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.  He was continued
on a Prednisone taper and treated with Atrovent and Albuterol
nebulizers with chest PT.  The patient remained afebrile
without a white blood cell count and there was no concern
that his pneumonia had returned.

As the patient continued to diurese, the lasix was decreased
to 30 mg p.o. q. day during his last day of hospitalization.
On the day of discharge, the patient was at 30 mg p.o. q. day
of Prednisone.  This was day one of three of the 30 mg dose.
He is to be subsequently tapered by 10 mg every three days.

After the pacemaker placement the patient was restarted on
Coumadin.  His INR was 1.5 the day prior to discharge.  He is
receiving a dose of 5 mg p.o. q. h.s.

The patient also received Vancomycin for two days when he
received his pacemaker and three d
