Pertinent Results:
Ct Head [**8-18**] - Extensive subarachnoid hemorrhage within right
frontoparietal sulci, basal cisterns, and upper cervical spinal
canal

CT angiogram - [**8-18**] - 1.  Diffuse subarachnoid hemorrhage,
substantially more extensive in the right
supratentorial compartment, unchanged from the study done
approximately 6
hours earlier at [**Hospital 8641**] Hospital.

2.  No evidence of aneurysm larger than 2 mm, with no evidence
of either
diffuse or focal vasospasm.

3.  Tubular hyperattenuating structure traversing the right
sylvian fissure
and perisylvian region, extending up to the vertex, which could
represent
cortical vein thrombosis, related to the SAH, above; however, on
CTA, the
regional cortical veins and principal dural venous sinuses
appear patent,
noting that the study is not specifically designed to evaluate
the venous
system.  In the absence of proven venous thrombosis, this
finding likely
represents clotted subarachnoid blood in an unusual
configuration.

[**2184-8-19**] Ct Head - No significant interval change in the size and
distribution of subarachnoid hemorrhage, without evidence of new
hemorrhage.

[**8-19**] Cervical MRI: 1.  No ligamentous injury.
2.  No abnormality identified at C5-C6.
3.  Multilevel degenerative change of the cervical spine as
described in
detail above.

[**8-19**] Hand Xray:

[**8-20**] Head CT: IMPRESSION:  Expected interval redistribution of
existing subarachnoid hemorrhage, without evidence of new
hemorrhage or mass effect.


Brief Hospital Course:
Patient was admitted to neurosurgery ICU for further management
on [**8-18**]. A trauma evaluation was requested to rule out other
injury. A spine consult was requested due to a C5 lucency. They
requested an MRI. A repeat head CT with angiogram was obtained
which showed no evidence of aneurysm.  Patient remained stable
overnight.  A repeat head CT on [**8-19**] showed no changed.  Pt was
transferred to floor in stable condition.  The MRI spine was
performed revealing no traumatic injury, fracture or ligamentous
instability. Her collar was removed.

On [**8-20**] she was neurologically intact. She was encouraged to get
OOB and PT/OT were consulted for assistance with discharge
planning. They felt that she was unsteady and her feet on [**2184-8-21**]
and wanted to work with her another day.
On [**8-22**] she was again seen by PT and at this time they
recommended discharging to an inpatient rehab. She was otherwise
neurologically stable.
On [**8-24**], patient had some confusion, and a UA was obtained which
was Positive for UTI and she was started on a 7 day course of
Oral Ciprofloxacin 500mg [**Hospital1 **].  Culture Pending at the time of
discharge.

At the time of discharge, patient is afebrile, VSS, and
neurologically stable.  Patient's pain is well-controlled and
the patient is tolerating a good oral diet.  Patient is
ambulating with assist. She is set for discharge to rehab in
stable condition and will follow-up accordingly.
