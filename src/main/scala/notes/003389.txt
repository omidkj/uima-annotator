History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 76 yr old woman with h/o HTN, DM, CHF on
digoxin, Afib on coumadin, who presented to [**Hospital3 **] for
altered mental status. Pt was last seen acting normally at
4:30pm, at which time she reported feeling dizzy and went to lay
down. Around 7pm, she was found by her husband laying on her
right side, moaning and unresponsive. No tremors or bladder or
bowel incontinence noted. She was brought by EMS into the OSH ED
for evaluation. There she was reportedly nonverbal but combative
and received ativan 2mg IV x 2. CT head was negative for
intracranial hemorrhage. CXR was significant for a RLQ pneumonia
and pt was given levofloxacin 750mg IV. A digoxin level was
checked which was elevated to 2.8; K was 5.7. She was given 2
vials of digibind and intubated under succinylcholine with
propofol for sedation prior to transport for airway protection
due to diminished gag reflex in the setting of altered mental
status. ABG 7.4/41/111 on AC 500/12/70%/5.

In our ED, VS: T 97.3, HR 41, BP 154/49, O2sat 99% on AC at TV
500, rate 14, PEEP 5, and FiO2 100%. Her CXR showed a sizeable
RML infiltrate, and vanco dose given with 500cc NS. EKG showed
HR in low 40s. 3 vials of digibind drawn up. Toxicology was
consulted and recommended holding further digibind at this time
unless pt drops blood pressure as may overcompensate and affect
her baseline therapeutic level of digoxin. She was transferred
to MICU for monitoring.

On the MICU floor, pt report is intubated and sedated. Per her
husband, she had no fevers, chills, cough, or shortness of
breath suggestive of pneumonia; no choking or coughing with po
intake; no recent sick contacts or hospitalizations. Pt eats
small meals throughout day; husband did not note any recent
change in po intake. She did not complain of any vision changes,
N/V, abd pain, diarrhea, headache, confusion, or hallucinations.
Of note, was seen in Cardiology clinic the day prior with
discontinuation of propanalol and clonidine.

EKG:
Sinus bradycardia with first degree atrio-ventricular conduction
delay.
Non-specific QRS widening with left axis deviation and diffuse
repolarization abnormalities. Compared to the previous tracing
of [**2141-12-23**] cardiac rhythm is now sinus mechanism with A-V
conduction delay.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2142-7-20**] 12:52 AM
1. Right perihilar pneumonia or hemorrhage.
2. Left retrocardiac atelectasis or aspiration.
3. Moderate cardiomegaly, without pulmonary edema.

 KNEE (AP, LAT & OBLIQUE) RIGHT Study Date of [**2142-7-22**] 2:46 PM
The bones are diffusely demineralized. Degenerative changes are
present predominantly in the medial compartment where there is
joint space
narrowing and subchondral sclerosis. Minimal osteophyte
formation is also
noted in the patellofemoral compartment. No discrete fracture is
evident and there is no evidence of dislocation. An equivocal
small suprapatellar joint effusion is demonstrated as well as
extensive vascular calcifications within the soft tissues.

 CTA CHEST W&W/O C&RECONS, NON-CORONARY Study Date of [**2142-7-24**]
1:09 AM
1. No PE.
2. Diffuse septal thickening, small bilateral pleural effusions,

cardiomegaly, and ground-glass opacities in the dependent
portion of the upper and lower lobes. The constellation of
findings is most compatible with CHF.
3. Subcentimeter hypodensity in the right lobe of the thyroid,
for which
further evaluation with ultrasound can be performed on a
non-emergent basis.

  TTE (Complete) Done [**2142-7-25**] at 1:51:57 PM      FINAL
The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right atrial pressure
is indeterminate. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is moderate regional
left ventricular systolic dysfunction with hypokinesis of the
septum and inferior walls. The remaining segments contract well
(LVEF = 30-35 %). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased
left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right
ventricular chamber size is normal with mild global free wall
hypokinesis. The ascending aorta and arch are normal in
diameter. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are moderately
thickened. There is severe aortic valve stenosis (valve area
0.8cm2). No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild to moderate ([**2-2**]+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic
pressure is high normal. There is a no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
regional systolic dysfunction c/w CAD. Severe aortic valve
stenosis. Mild-moderate mitral regurgitation.


Brief Hospital Course:
76 yo female with PMH of atrial fibrillation admitted with
confusion and found to have digoxin toxicity, pneumonia and
acute renal failure.

# Digoxin toxicity: Digoxin levels elevated in toxic range with
bradycardia and PR prolongation.  Likely in setting of
hyperkalemia from acute renal failure from dehydration, possibly
secondar
