Service:  MICU
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 53 year-old woman
with a history of morbid obesity, chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease and asthma who presented with five days or
productive cough, fever and shortness of breath.  She was in
her usual state of health namely on home oxygen as needed and
stairs and thus leave her home until [**2178-10-22**] when
she developed a cough and rhinorrhea.  She began to wheeze
and noted green sputum with her cough.  She had fevers,
chills and a temperature to 102 on the 14th.  She became bed
bound from her increasing dyspnea.  She has not had chest
pain for the last four to five years.  Her last
hospitalization was two years ago for an asthma flare.  She

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Ms. [**Known lastname **] [**Last Name (Titles) 18038**] "a lot for a long time."
she recently quit.  She denies alcohol or intravenous drug
abuse.  She lives alone in [**Location (un) **].  She has limited
mobility, although she is able to ambulate with a front
wheeled walker, though not recently due to her illness.  She
is currently applying for a motorized wheel chair.  She has a
homemaker who comes in a couple of times a week to help her
out at home and to feed her five cats.  She is a full code.
She has no health care proxy, but her next of [**Doctor First Name **] is her
brother [**Name (NI) **] whose phone number is [**Telephone/Fax (1) 18039**].

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  She was afebrile with a temperature of
99.1, pulse 92, blood pressure of 116/48.  Respiratory rate
24 and an oxygen saturation of 93% on 6 liters face mask.
Her HEENT examination was unremarkable.  It was impossible to
see jugulovenous distention, because of body habitus.  Her
weight was 450 pounds in a woman who is about 5'5".  Her
lungs revealed poor air exchange with diffuse bilateral
expiratory wheezes.  Her heart was regular with distant heart
sounds and no apparent murmurs or gallops.  Her abdomen
revealed an enlarged pannus and was morbidly obese.  There is
an erythematous confluent weeping papular rash on the left
side of her panus that extended onto her thigh.  Her skin was
indurated with scale and plaque evident.  Her abdomen was
nontender and with good bowel sounds.  Her extremities were
with 2+ pitting edema of her bilateral lower extremity to the
knees.  Her neurological examination revealed a woman who was
awake and oriented times three, although quite somnolent.
Her cranial nerves were grossly intact.

LABORATORY:  On presentation her white count was 8.8 with a
normal differential.  Hematocrit 31 and her platelet count
was 388.  Her sodium was 136, potassium 4.8, chloride 101,
bicarb 24, BUN 44, creatinine 2.7.  Her glucose was 172.  Her
arterial blood gases on presentation was 7.09, 88 and 107.
Her chest x-ray revealed bilateral lung base opacities
consistent with pneumonia or aspiration, although the film
was limited due to body habitus.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  1.  Pulmonary:  This 53 year-old woman with
a history of morbid obesity was admitted with a chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation due to a viral
upper respiratory infection versus pneumonia.  She initially
received Solu-Medrol, nebulizers and supplemental oxygen in
the Emergency Room.  She was admitted to the floor, but had
increasing lethargy, tachypnea and acidosis with a pH of 7.09
that led to intubation.  Her intubation was incredibly
difficult and took over an hour and required fiberoptic
intubation.  She was then transferred to the MICU.  She was
started on Solu-Medrol for her chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease exacerbation, which was eventually changed to
Prednisone and slowly tapered.  She is now off steroids.  She
initially received Albuterol and Atrovent nebulizers q 2 to 4
hours, which was slowly decreased until her wheezing stopped.
She was switched to Combivent and had no wheezing for the
last three weeks of her hospitalization.  She failed weaning
off of the ventilator and underwent a bedside tracheostomy on
[**2178-11-6**].  She is required to return to assist control with a
respiratory rate of 12 tidal volume 600, FIO2 40% during her
various febrile episodes.  She is currently weaned to 40%
trach mask during the day and pressure support ventilation of
5 with a PEEP of 5 and an FIO2 of 40% at night.  On these
setting she has good ventilation and oxygenation.  She is
tolerating Passey-Muir valve well and is able to speak.

2.  Cardiac:  Ms. [**Known lastname **] suffered an acute myocardial
infarction with electrocardiogram changes and a troponin peak
of 13 during a septic episode on [**2178-11-1**].   She
was initially placed on aspirin, but that was stopped,
because of a history of gastrointestinal bleed and a drop in
her hematocrit.  She was maintained on Lopressor with no
evidence of bronchospasm at her current dose.  She was
successfully diuresed after receiving many liters of fluid
while septic.  Although it is difficult to assess her fluid
status given her body habitus, she is likely close to being
euvolemic right now.

3.  Infectious disease:  Ms. [**Known lastname **] received Levofloxacin
initially for a community acquired pneumonia.  Septic
physiology was revealed by Swan parameters on [**11-1**]
although no organism or source was identified.  She received
a ten day course of vancomycin, Ceftazidime and Flagyl for
this.  She then developed MRSA pneumonia and
MRSE line sepsis on the [**10-19**] for which she
received a ten day course of Vancomycin.  She has sputum that
is colonized with Acinetobacter.  She now has a right thigh
cellulitis for which she is receiving a fourteen day course
of Oxacillin.  Her urine is colonized with yeast.  She will
not require Fluconazole unless she has clinical signs of a
urinary tract infection.  Treatment of this is unlikely to
be successful until she is no longer requiring long term Foley
catheter.

4.  Renal:  She came in with an acute on chronic renal
failure.  Her BUN and creatinine peaked at 127 and 5.0
respectively and slowly fell to baseline.  She is now at 33
and 1.9.  Her baseline creatinine ranges between 2.1 and 2.3.
Her Enalapril was initially held, but eventually restarted
without a bump in her creatinine.  She has maintained good
urine output once her initial acute renal failure improved.
Her episode of acute renal failure was complicated by
metabolic acidosis that was treated with bicarbonate orally
and has since resolved.  The bicarbonate has been stopped.

5.  Gastrointestinal:  Due to her body habitus, she was not a
candidate for a PEG or a GJ tube placement after consulting
interventional radiology, general surgery and
gastroenterology.  She initially had a high residual while
she had poor GI motility as she was impacted.  This resolved
by the end of her hospital course with aggressive bowel
regimen and this impaction.  She had good tolerance of tube
feeds via a feeding tube with no residuals until she pulled
out.  She is now on [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Na
