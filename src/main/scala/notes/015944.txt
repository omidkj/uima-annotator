HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 64 year-old woman with
a history of asthma and laryngeal dysfunction who presented
to the Emergency Department with a complaint of an asthma
exacerbation.  She denies shortness of breath and wheezing.
She apparently uses frequent doses of Albuterol nearly
continuously prior to her visit to the Emergency Room.  She
also took 80 mg of Prednisone the day of admission, although
her usual dose is around 20.  In the Emergency Room she was
noted to have peak flows in the 180s.  She received multiple
nebulizers with improvement of her peak flow to about 350,
which was her baseline.  She subsequently stated she felt
better.  Per the Emergency Department physician she was
reluctant to be discharged home and became very anxious, so
anxious to the point that she was found to develop worsening
respiratory distress, became diaphoretic and cyanotic and was
unable to speak.  She was intubated and required multiple
doses of Ativan for sedation as she continued to be agitated
on the vent in the Emergency Room.  She was admitted to the
Medical Intensive Care Unit on the [**Hospital Ward Name 516**].

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Physical examination revealed an obese
woman who is intubated and sedated.  She is afebrile with a
blood pressure of 126/80. Pulse 82.  Oxygen saturation 98% on
AC 600, 12, 100% with a PEEP of five.  She has a left
surgical pupil.  Her chest is mostly clear with occasional
wheeze.  Her heart is distant with regular rhythm and no
murmurs.  Her abdomen is obese with many stria.  Nontender
and nondistended.  Her extremities revealed chronic venous
insufficiency changes and some edema.  She is sedated on
neurological examination.

LABORATORY:  White blood cell count 21.9, hematocrit 46.9,
platelets count 258.  INR 1.0, PTT 23.  Her chem 7 is within
normal limits except for a glucose of 276.  Her urinalysis
has 500 glucose and 300 of protein.  Her blood gas is 7.3, 57
and 422 on these vent settings.  Chest x-ray is rotated with
endotracheal tube around 4 cm of the carina and no
infiltrates.  Electrocardiogram is normal sinus rhythm at
around 93 with a slight leftward axis and poor R wave
progression.  She has no acute ischemic changes.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Mrs. [**Known lastname 109911**] was intubated and easily
ventilated.  There was a concern for vocal cord dysfunction
as the cause of her respiratory failure rather then asthma
given how well she has responded to nebulizers in the
Emergency Department.  She was extubated and transferred to
the floor the day after intubation.  She did well from a
respiratory standpoint and was seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 217**] her
pulmonologist while in the hospital.  He recommended elective
outpatient tracheostomy so that if further episodes of vocal
cord dysfunction were to occur she would have recourse short
of intubation.  Once her breathing returned to [**Location 213**], she
was discharged home to follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 217**] and
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] as an outpatient.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Improved.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  To home.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Respiratory failure secondary to laryngeal cord
dysfunction.
2.  Asthma exacerbation.
