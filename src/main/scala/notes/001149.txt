CT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST  [**2124-5-13**] 4:35 PM
IMPRESSION:
1. Big areas of increased opacity involving the lingula, right
upper lobe, and right middle lobe, which are new when compared
to prior chest CT of [**2124-3-11**] and likely represent
developing areas of infiltrate/pneumonia.
2. Multiple intra-abdominal and pelvic fluid collections as
described in detail above, which appear unchanged in size. The
largest of these involving the tail of the pancreas demonstrates
interval development of gas. The remainder are unchanged.
3. Surgical drains as described above, unchanged.
4. Moderate bilateral pleural effusions and bibasilar
atelectasis.
.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2124-5-15**] 1:15 PM
FINDINGS: In comparison with study of [**5-13**], there is little
overall change. There are again diffuse bilateral opacifications
consistent with pulmonary edema. Retrocardiac opacification most
likely represents atelectasis, though pneumonia can certainly
not be excluded.

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 76 yo male well know to the surgery service with a
history of necrotizing gallstone pancreatitis, s/p partial Open
Chole [**2124-4-2**]. He had a prolonged hospital course and prolonged
ICU stay. He had a Percutaneous Cholecystostomy tube placed on
[**2124-2-17**] and developed a Cholecystocutaneous fistula. This was
managed with PTC placement.

He was at rehab and developed fever and increased WBC.

A CT Abd showed big areas of increased opacity involving the
lingula, right upper lobe, and right middle lobe, which are new
when compared to prior chest CT of [**2124-3-11**] and likely
represent developing areas of infiltrate/pneumonia.

He was started on Levofloxacin for treatment of pneumonia. He
will complete a 14 day course.

Hypoglycemia: He received NPH and became hypoglycemic and was
somnolent. He received 1 amp of D50%. He was still somnolent and
was transferred to the ICU. The next day he was transferred back
to the floor. The NPH was D/C'd and he was managed with a
sliding scale.

Hypotension: He was hypotensive on [**2124-5-17**]. He received a 500 LR
bolus and responded appropriately. His Lopressor was D/C'd.

GI/ABD: He was tolerating a regular diet. His [**Doctor Last Name 406**] drain with
ostomy appliance was pulled. He had two drains (pigtail abscess
drain, and PTC) in the right side that were capped. The PTC
needs to remain in place and can remained capped. The pigtail
abscess drain was removed and was draining thick sero-sang,
malodorous fluid. An ostomy appliance was placed over the wound
for drainage control. The dressing will need to be changed PRN.
His GJ tube was capped.
