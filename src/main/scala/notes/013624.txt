Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Sulfonamides / Codeine / Hydrochlorothiazide / Ace Inhibitors

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2751**]
Chief Complaint:
Abdominal pain/nausea x24 hours

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None.

History of Present Illness:
This is a [**Age over 90 **]-year-old female with a past medical history of
hypertension, hypothyroidism, GI bleed in [**8-/2164**] who presents
from home with abdominal pain, [**9-15**] and intermittent nausea,
for the past 24 hours.

Upon arrival in ED, patient was febrile to 101.7, and elevated
LFTs were concerning for cholangitis.  A CTA of the abdomen
demonstrated a dilated CBD with a stone obstructing the ampula.
Patient was tachycardic to 120-130s, and was given IV fluids and
cipro, flagyl, unasyn.  Crackles were heard at her lower lung
bases, and IVF were eventually discontinued.  ERCP was
consulted, and during the course of a long discussion with ERCP
fellow, family, and geriatrics fellow, it was felt that surgical
intervention (i.e. ERCP) would not be in accordance with
patient's wishes as she is DNR/DNI.  The decision was made to
treat patient with antibiotics and symptomatically, and she was
transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for further work-up.  Upon transfer to
the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], vitals were: VS: 101.7 129/59 128 24 96% 4L.  An
extensive note in the chart by ERCP fellow documents entirety of
this conversation.

Upon arrival in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], patient complained of abdominal
discomfort and missing her daughter.  She also complained of
thirst.  Vitals on arrival were: T: 98.8, BP: 108/43, RR: 28,
SP02 92% on 2L.

ROS:  Patient is a poor historian.  But she denies headache,
chest pain, shortness of breath, dysuria, or change in bowel
habits.

CTA Abdomen [**2164-12-7**]

1. Patent mesenteric vasculature with no evidence of mesenteric
ischemia.
2. Pronounced dilatation of the common bile duct measuring up to
17 mm, with moderate intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation.
Dilated CBD extends to the ampulla, which bulges into the
duodenum. There is associated ventral pancreatic ductal
dilatation. Precontrast images demonstrate a stone at the
ampulla.
3. Patchy hypoenhancing areas in the liver, most extensive in
the left
lateral segment, raising concern, in the overall context, for
hepatobiliary infection, although the infiltrative appearance is
in itself non-specific.
4. Dilated main pancreatic duct with widespread peripancreatic
fluid
consistent with pancreatitis. Ill-defined fluid and edema are
also extensive along the portal tracts, hepatic hilum and
gallbladder.
3. Distended gallbladder with echogenic layering material and
pericholecystic fluid, but most likely secondary to surrounding
inflammation and biliary obstruction, although coinciding
cholecystitis cannot be entirely excluded.
4. Compression of the T11 vertebral body, new since [**2161**], with
mild
retropulsion of the superior portion of the vertebral body into
the spinal
canal.
5. Extensive colonic diverticulosis without diverticulitis.
6. Extensive atherosclerotic disease.

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a [**Age over 90 **]-year-old lady with choledocholithiasis vs.
cholangitis who presents from home with a 24-hour history of
abdominal pain and nausea with CT abdomen suggestive of distal
CBD obstruction with stone and pancreatitis, and bacteremia.
.
CBD OBSTRUCTION/PANCREATITIS:  Patient is bacteremic with gram
negative rods, likely source being biliary tract - possibly
stone vs ampullary mass.  After long discussions with family,
ERCP team, and geriatrics, the decision was made not to pursue
ERCP and to keep patient comfortable.  The family is aware that
patient could pass away from overwhelming infection, but they do
not believe that invasive procedures and/or intubation would be
in accordance with her wishes.  Although the obstruction looked
like it could be a ampullary mass on initial read of CT,
radiology attending asserted that it was most likely a stone. Pt
received Zosyn for empiric gram negative coverage and IVF as
tolerated by respiratory status, though prior to transfer to
medical floor, comfort measures were instituted as per family
wishes, and antibiotics were discontinued on [**2164-12-9**]. Pain was
controlled with morphine. Palliative care, Geriatric PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **]
case management saw patient in ICU and on medical floor. Family
was interested in setting up home hospice care, and arrangements
were made.  Prior to discharge, 48 hours without treatment, she
was improving, decreased pain and agitation and eating.  It is
very possible the stone has passed.  Her PCP was made aware, and
if patient does well at home, can follow up with patient -- 11R
geriatric coordinator alerting clinic to make sooner follow-up.
.
TACHYCARDIA:  Sinus tachy. Most likely a combination of pain,
anxiety, fever, and infection. Pt's underlying infection was
treated with antibiotics as above. Agitation was treated with
zyprexa prn, and pain was controlled with morphine.
.
HYPOTHYROIDISM:  Continued home levothyroxine dose, but this was
discontinued when CMO measures instituted. Can be followed by
PCP (have alerted her)if she survives this.
.
HYPERTENSION:  Hold off on home anti-hypertensive medications,
as patient had SBPs in the 80s-90s. If she does well at home
with no demise, can re-institute as outpatient if she survives
this - PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 12309**].
.
AGITATION / DELERIUM:  Likely secondary to ICU delerium,
underlying infection and pain. Patient required restraints and
IV Haldol overnight in ICU. Patient refused to take PO meds, and
all possible meds were changed to IV. IV Haldol was continued on
the medical floor but restraints
