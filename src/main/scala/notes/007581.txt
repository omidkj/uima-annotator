Brief Hospital Course:
32F h/o asthma and intubations consistent with severe asthma
exacerbation.

ASTHMA
[**Known firstname 5877**] was initially admitted to the MICU where she was started
on solumedrol 80mg IV q8hrs and transitioned to oral prednisone
50mg daily for 5 days total. Albuterol/Ipratropium nebs q6hr prn
were continued. Advair substituted for symbicort while in house.
Was also treated with Azithromycin for 5 days for presumed
bacterial Bronchitis based on purulent sputum.  She was noted
have atypical respiratory exam with nearly absent breath sounds,
but appeared in no respiratory distress.  Wheezes were not
audible.  On multiple occassions patient reported concern that
she was not being treated appropriately (due to transition from
IV steroids to oral) and tried to leave AMA.  She also stated on
numerous occassions that she "wished she was inutabed" thinking
she would feel better if that had been the case.  She maintained
that she asked the team not to intubate her. Patient was
suspected of breath holding and this was confirmed by placing
stethoscope on chest for prolonged periods, patient would cough
and in the process large volume air movement could be
appreciated X 1 then no breath sounds again for 30 seconds to
one minute.  This process would repeat.  Patient was continued
on oral steroids/azithromycin 5 day course which was completed
while patient was hospitalized.  She was continued on prn
nebulizers which were prescribed for patient comfort.  On day of
discharge patient was cooperative with exam, she had good
airmovement with clear breath sounds, no wheezes.  She reported
her breathing was much improved.

Patient described pleuritic chest pain which was found not to be
cardiac in origin or related to PE as negative CTA. She was
treated symptomatically.  She continued to report intermittent
chest tightness which resolved by day of discharge.
.
UNRESPONSIVENESS
Her hospitalization was notable for three episodes of sudden
unresponsiveness with chest discomfort/tightness prior to all.
Pt denies any history of episodes like these previously, says
they are different from prior syncopal drop attacks she has had
previously.  First episode was noted in the ED on arrival, no
breath sounds were noted, HR 160, Hemodynamically stable, O2
sats in the 90s to 100%.  Symptoms improved suddenly with NIV.
Subsequent episode in ICU was observed, possibly thought to be
secondary to low cardiac output in vagal state, and initiation
of CLS feature as described below.  She was tachycardic and
hemodynamically stable, no air movement noted on exam, no drop
in O2 sats throughout the episodes.  Episodes resolve suddenly
with no postdrome. During third episode which occured several
hour
