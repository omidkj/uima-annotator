TEE intra op Conclusions :
The left atrium is markedly dilated. No mass/thrombus is seen in
the left atrium or left atrial appendage. A septal occluder
device is seen across the interatrial septum. Left ventricular
wall thicknesses are normal. Regional left ventricular wall
motion is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
normal (LVEF>55%). with moderate global free wall hypokinesis.
There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch. There are simple
atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve appears
structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.


Brief Hospital Course:
Following admission a Pulmonary Medicine consult was obtained
due to his chronic cough.  Symptoms were felt to be likely due
to gastric reflux and bronchodilators and Flonase were
recommended.  On [**10-9**] he went to the Operating Room, where via
a median sternotomy, a full MAZE was performed.  He remained
stable, was extubated easily and was briefly in sinus rhythm. On
POD 2 he developed rapid atrial fibrillation and Amiodarone and
beta blockers were titrated.  Coumadin and Heparin were begun.

He remained in controlled fibrillation and cardioversion was
performed on [**10-14**]. This was unsuccessful after two attempts,
however, upom return to the floor he converted to sinus rhythm,
but reverted to controlled atrial fibrillation several hours
later.

Arrangements for follow up, Coumadin management will be done by
the patient as he did preoperatively. He self tests.
