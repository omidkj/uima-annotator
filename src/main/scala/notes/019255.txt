Choked, dyspnea.

hemodialysis

History of Present Illness:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 4553**] is a 62 year old female with history of IDDM x 25
years, ESRD on HD, 5 vessel CABG in [**2103**], CHF (EF 55% in [**8-30**],
with diastolic dysfunction), HTN, hypercholesterolemia, and
COPD, who presented on [**2112-3-13**] s/p an episode of choking on
coffee.  The patient reports that she simply choked on the
coffee, and this is not a frequent occurrence.  Denies any
dysphagia.  She does note increased coughing over the last
couple of months, non-productive.  She denies any [**Date Range 5162**] or
chills.  Denies shortness of breath prior to this
hospitaliztion, but says since the choking episode she has been
more short of breath.  She denies chest pain.  She does note
orthopnea, but no LE edema.

While in the E.D. she was found to have a saturation of 88% on
RA, and was markedly hypertensive (236/73).  She was started on
levaquin/flagyl for presumed aspiration (question of slight PNA
on CXR which has since been read as negative).  There was also
felt to be a component of CHF, confirmed on CXR, and she was
given lasix 40 mg IV, however subsequently required fluids for
DKA as her nightly glargine was unfortunately not given in the
ED.  Her sugars on the following morning were noted to be 700s,
with an anion gap of 19 and hyperkalemia.  She was transferred
to the MICU where she was started on an insulin drip, with
improved control and closure of her gap.  However, during the
course of her MICU stay she is more than 2 L positive.  She was
ruled out for MI by cardiac enzymes, EKG unchanged.  Also in the
MICU she had a RUQ US secondary to complaint of RUQ pain on
admission, however this was normal and her pain has resolved.
She is not being called out to the floors.

Pertinent Results:
VIDEO OROPHARYNGEAL SWALLOW: The examination was performed in
conjunction with a speech therapist. Barium was administered in
various consistencies under fluoroscopic guidance, including
thick barium, thin, puree, barium- soaked cookie, cheerios, and
a barium tablet. The patient was able to swallow thick barium
liquid without difficulty. When a teaspoon of thin barium was
administered, there was trace penetration before the swallow,
and aspiration during the swallow. There is no spontaneous
cough. However, when thin barium was administered in a cup, no
aspiration occurred. When the patient took straw sips of thin,
trace penetration occurred without aspiration. The penetration
of thin barium was cleared with a cued cough. With the barium
tablet administration, the patient aspirated a mild amount of
water, which was not cleared with a spontaneous cough.
IMPRESSION: Trace aspiration episodes with thin liquids as
described. For a more detailed report, please refer to the
report of the speech pathologist.

[**3-13**]:  PA AND LATERAL CHEST: Comparison is made to [**2111-12-5**].
Again, seen is a dual lumen central venous line with the tip in
the distal SVC, unchanged. Cardiac size is unchanged. There are
chronic appearing changes in the pulmonary vasculature with mild
CHF, and small bilateral effusions. Osseous structures are
diffusely demineralized. IMPRESSION: Stable mild CHF. No
evidence of pneumonia.

[**3-14**]:  RIGHT UPPER QUADRANT ULTRASOUND: There is no intra or
extrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation, with the common bile
duct measuring approximately 2-3 mm. No focal hepatic masses or
fluid collections are seen. The gallbladder has been removed
surgically. Evaluation of the distal duct near the pancreas was
severely limited by overlying bowel gas. The pancreas is not
visualized. There is a 3 cm cyst in the upper pole of the right
kidney, as seen on the prior [**2111-3-12**] study. IMPRESSION:
No biliary ductal dilatation or evidence of retained stone.
Distal CBD and pancreas not visualized.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 4553**] is a 62 year old female with IDDM x 25 years, ESRD
on HD, 5 vessel CABG in [**2103**], CHF(EF 55% in [**8-30**], but diastolic
dysfunction as well), HTN, hypercholesterolemia, and COPD, who
presented s/p an aspiration event with O2 sat 88% on RA in the
ED, subsequently transferred to the MICU with DKA secondary to
missing her nightly glargine then stabilized and transferred to
the floors.

1) Hypoxia:  Thought secondary to aspiration
pneumonia/pneumonitis given aspiration event at home, however
likely component of CHF as well, as CXR did not demon
