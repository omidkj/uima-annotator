CHEST (PA & LAT)

Reason: eval for pleural effusions

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
51 year old woman s/p CABG and plating
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
eval for pleural effusions
CHEST TWO VIEWS ON [**3-12**]

HISTORY: Status post CABG and plating.

REFERENCE EXAM: [**3-8**]

The sternotomy fixation devices are unchanged. The cardiac and
mediastinal silhouettes are unchanged. There continues to be
some patchy areas of volume loss that have increased in the
right lower lung and left mid lung. There is a small right and
small left pleural effusions that have also slightly increased.
There is a left PICC line with tip in the SVC. There is a second
catheter overlying the right upper abdomen and right chest, it
is unclear exactly where this catheter drain is located.

PICC LINE PLACEMENT

INDICATION: IV access needed for antibiotics.

The procedure was explained to the patient. A timeout was
performed.

RADIOLOGIST: Drs. [**Last Name (STitle) 9441**] and [**Name5 (PTitle) 3175**] performed the procedure.
Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 3175**], the Attending Radiologist, was present and
supervised the entire procedure.

TECHNIQUE: Using sterile technique and local anesthesia, the
left brachial vein was punctured under direct ultrasound
guidance using a micropuncture set. Hard copies of ultrasound
images were obtained before and immediately after establishing
intravenous access. A peel-away sheath was then placed over a
guidewire and a single lumen PICC line measuring 46 cm in length
was then placed through the peel-away sheath with its tip
positioned in the SVC under fluoroscopic guidance. Position of
the catheter was confirmed by a fluoroscopic spot film of the
chest.

The peel-away sheath and guidewire were then removed. The
catheter was secured to the skin, flushed, and a sterile
dressing applied.

The patient tolerated the procedure well. There were no
immediate complications.

IMPRESSION: Uncomplicated ultrasound and fluoroscopically guided
single lumen PICC line placement via the left brachial venous
approach. Final internal length is 46 cm, with the tip
positioned in SVC. The line is ready to use.

Brief Hospital Course:
She was admitted to cardiac surgery. She was seen by plastic
surgery. CT scan showed deep sternal wound infection. She was
taken to the operating room on [**3-2**] where she underwent a
sternal debridement with placement of VAC dressing. She was
transferred to the ICU and remained sedated and paralyzed while
her chest was open. She continued on vancomycin, as well as
zosyn for broad empiric coverage. She was taken back to the
operating room on [**3-6**] where she underwent sternal plating and
bilateral pectoralis flap advancement. She was extubated on POD
#2, and she was transferred to the floor. She progressed well, 1
JP drain was dc'd and she was ready for discharge home on POD
#[**10-20**].
