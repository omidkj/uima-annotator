Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2932**]
Chief Complaint:
shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Liver FNA/core biopsy


History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 77 year old female with COPD on home O2, h/o T3
lung Ca s/p right pneumonectomy presents with worsening
shortness of breath x 3-4 weeks. The patient has baseline SOB
with exertion since her lung cancer diagnosis 4 years ago. She
is usually on 2L O2 at home but has been increasing this to 3L
over the last few days (and using for longer periods). She was
admitted to the hospital (ICU) 1 month ago with a COPD flare and
was sent home on prednisone 40mg with was quickly tapered down
to 10mg which is what the patient is currently on. She reports
never feeling back to her baseline since that admission. + cough
- occasionaly productive. + weakness and fatigue over the last
few weeks. Denies chest pain, fevers, chills, abdominal pain.
Reports increased frequency of urination, no dysuria.

Of note, the patient had a positive PET scan on [**2196-4-24**] and was
scheduled for a bronchoscopy and biopsy on [**2196-5-13**] but did not
go to appointment. On that day she was extremely SOB and went to
the ED. She was discharged that afternoon from the ED with a
diagnosis of anxiety induced SOB. She is followed by Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **]
in thoracics.

In the ED, original vital signs were T99.1, HR 106, BP 160/79,
RR 29, O2 93% 3L. She desaturated with minimal exertion while in
the ED to the mid 80's. An ABG showed 7.37/64/103/38. CXR was
unremarkable other than known whiteout of right lung field. She
received atrovent and albuterol nebs, azithromycin 500mg PO x 1,
and solumedrol 125mg IV x 1. EKG was unremarkable. She was
admitted to the ICU for further treatment of COPD flare.

EKG [**5-17**]: Sinus rhythm with PACs. Possible right atrial
abnormality. Poor R wave progression - possible inferior
myocardial infarction. Left axis deviation.Since previous
tracing of [**2196-4-5**], no significant change

Other tests:
TSH-0.10* T3-56* Free T4-0.94

[**Date Range **]:
[**5-17**] CXR: Comparison with [**2196-4-5**] examination. Left lower
lobe consolidation is improved on today's examination, but some
residual opacity is seen, as well as slight hazy silhouetting at
the left hemidiaphragm, which may represent residual left
pleural effusion. Cardiac, mediastinal, and hilar contours are
unchanged; changes of right pneumonectomy are again noted, with
mediastinal shift to the right. No pneumothorax on the left.
Osseous structures are unchanged.

[**5-18**] CT chest:  There are stable postoperative changes status
post right pneumonectomy with rightward mediastinal shift and
stable smooth thickening surrounding the fluid-filled
pneumonectomy space. The lingular subpleural opacities are not
significantly changed from prior exam and may be inflammatory.
However, there are several subpleural left lower lobe densities
as well as a more centrally located small nodule. Additional
tiny new nodules are identified in the left apical posterior
segment. The 16 x 15 mm left hilar node has slightly decreased
in size. Mediastinal nodes are unchanged in size or appearance,
the largest pretracheal node measuring 17 x 8 mm. Small left
pleural effusion is stable. The heart size is normal. Mild
aortic and coronary calcifications are identified. There are
multiple new enhancing right hepatic lesions, the largest
measuring 15 and 12 mm. No adrenal masses are identified.
Sclerotic lesion in T6 is not significantly changed from prior
exam but is new since [**2194**]. No cortical disruption is
identified.
IMPRESSION:
1. Disseminated malignancy with multiple new left pulmonary and
right hepatic metastasis.
2. T6 sclerotic lesion consistent with metastasis.
3. No evidence of local tumor recurrence in the right
hemithorax.

Cytology
sputum [**5-17**]: NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS. Pulmonary macrophages
and squamous cells.

Brief Hospital Course:
77 year old female yo female h/o severe COPD (on 2L NC at home),
T3 lung cancer s/p R pneumonectomy 4 years ago, admitted with
COPD flare, found to have new liver, lung, and T6 lesions
concerning for metastases.

1) COPD exacerbation: The patient received high dose steroids,
bronchodilators, and 5 days of azithromycin. Her respiratory
status gradually improved, and she was transferred from the ICU
to the general medical floor [**2196-5-18**]. There, she was continued
on a steroids, which will gradually taper until she follows up
with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] next week, who will decide whether to continue
steroids.  At time of discharge, she was close to her baseline
respiratory status and was on her home O2 requirement (2
liters).

2) Liver/lung/spine masses: A Chest CT revealed new left
pulmonary and right hepatic masses, along with a new T6
sclerotic lesion (see result section). These findings are
concerning for metastases, most likely lung CA, although pt also
has h/o breast CA and a known cystic lesion near the duodenum
(noted on a prior admission). The patient underwent an
ultrasound-guided liver biopsy on [**2196-5-25**], the results of which
are pending at time of discharge. The patient will follow-up
with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and her PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) 4844**] to discuss the results
and potential treatment.

3) Type II diabetes poorly controlled with complications: The
patient was continued on Lantus with a Humalog sliding scale
while in-house. As her prednisone dose was tapered, her glucose
control improved and she was discharged on her home Lantus
regimen (8 units).

4) Thyroid function test abnormalities: The patient's TSH was
noted to be depressed at 0.1, although her free T4 was normal at
0.94. These should be repeated as an outpatient in 6 weeks.

5) Hypertension: The patient was continued on diltiazem.

6) Disposition: The patient was discharged home with VNA and PT
to follow-up with her PCP and CT surgeon.
