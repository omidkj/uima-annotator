Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2186**]
Chief Complaint:
N/V, hypertensive urgency

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Hemodialysis

History of Present Illness:
46 yo man with DM, recent PE,  ESRD on HD, HIV (VL <50, CD4 393
[**2-13**]), and multiple recent ED visits/admissions for
N/V/hypertensive urgency with N/V many times today.  Had HD this
AM, then became nauseous at work with non-bilious, non bloody
emesis "too many times to count".   He denies abdominal pain,
fevers, chills.   He does report shortness of breath developing
today without CP, PND, palpitations, orthopnea. Admitted
overnight [**6-23**] for SOB and hypertensive urgency, was placed on
home medications, dialyzed and left the next AM.
.
In ED, he had CXR which showed e/o worsening pulmonary edema, nl
EKG, trop 0.24 with flat CKs (BL trop elevated at previous
admissions).  He received ASA, nitro with no improvement of BPs,
SOB.  He was then given labetalol 10mg X2, with no improvement
of pressure and developed increased SOB, sats to 89%.  He was
then started on 2L NC and nitro gtt with SBPs transiently to
190s, but back to 230s, and was started on nipride gtt as he was
being moved to ICU.

.
[**6-26**] CXR: Interval increase in the heart size with increased
pulmonary
vascular congestion suggests worsening of heart failure.
.
[**6-27**] LENIs, bilateral: No evidence for deep venous thrombosis in
bilateral lower extremities.
.
[**6-13**] Echo:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The estimated right atrial
pressure is  11-15mmHg. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. The left  ventricular cavity size is normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function  is normal (LVEF
60%). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left
ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). There is no
ventricular septal  defect. Right ventricular chamber size and
free wall motion are normal. The  aortic valve leaflets (3) are
mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets aremildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. There is severe
mitral annular  calcification. At least mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is present. [Due to  acoustic shadowing, the
severity of mitral regurgitation may be significantly
UNDERestimated.] There is mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There  is no
pericardial effusion.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed)
of [**2108-7-10**], the [**Last Name (un) 22837**] annular calcification is now
severe, and the mitral  regurgitation is increased.
.
[**6-24**] CT-PE protocol
1.  No new pulmonary embolism is detected.
2.  Stable findings of chronic right lower lobe subsegmental
pulmonary embolus.
3.  Increased pulmonary edema.
4.  Left thyroid hypodense nodule for which ultrasound may be
obtained for further evaluation.

Brief Hospital Course:
1. hypertensive urgency:
Patient came on due to nausea and vomiting and was found to be
in hypertensive urgency. Patient had no mental status changes,
most likely due to not taking antihypertensives prior to
dialysis, and vomiting the medications the day prior. In the
ICU, patient transiently on nipride drip, but was changed to ntg
gtt due to nipride being relatively contra-indicated in renal
failure due to possiblity of CN- accumulation.  HD helped remove
fluid wiht 2.8L UF the day after admission. Patient restarted on
home regimine of lisinopril, diovan, nifedipine and atenolol.
Clonidine was added for addional control. Controlling nausea to
help keep medications down. Patient stable with systolics in
140's on discharge.
.
2. N/V:
The patient has a history of gastroparesis and found in
hypertensive urgency, both of which likely contributed to his
nausea/vomiting. Patient had benign abdominal exam, however
given diabetic with neuropathy, checked LFTs, amylase, lipase,
which were negative. Continued aggressive antiemetics reglan,
compazine, zofran. Schedule as outpatient for gastric emptying
scan. Nausea/vomiting resolved prior to coming to ED. [**Last Name (un) **]
pressure stablized in [**Hospital 2571**] transferred to [**Wardname 13764**] denying nausea,
vomiting, lightheadedness.
.
3. Pulmonary embolism
Patient recently diagnosed with PE, on coumadin. In hospital,
patients INR found to be subtherapeutic (1.3 - 1.5). Patient put
on heparin drip while INR becomes therapuetic with coumadin.
Patient very anxious to go home. Sent home on Lovenox SC with
close followup as outpatient to get INR checked. Patient is non
compliant with medications.
.
4. SOB:
Patient with known recent PE, non therapeutic INR. Patient also
due for dialysis on admission, although does not appear volume
overloaded. Patient may also have pulmonary edema secondary to
hypertensive urgency. Patient ruled out for ACS, no EKG changes,
CKs flat, with trop leak, likely secondary to CRF (BL trop
0.18-.29)
.
5. CKD stage V
Patient on hemodialysis: Complicated history, had been on PD, on
transplant list.
Hemodialized in hospital. continue lanthanum and sensipar.
.
6. HIV: HAART regimen continued.  Meds given after dialysis on
dialysis days. Pt has not been able to take meds due to nausea.
.
7. med non-compliance.  pt only selectively takes meds.
Discussed the imprortance of med compliance in terms of BP
control and history of clots.
.
8. Anemia: Felt to be result of longstanding ESRD. Continued
Epogen w/ HD
.
9. Peripheral Neuropathy: Longstanding secondary to DM1.
Continue gabapentin
.
10. Type I Diabetes Mellitus: will continue outpatient regimen
- NPH 10 [**Hospital1 **], with 5U regular qAM and humalog sliding scale.
