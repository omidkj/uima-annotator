Chief Complaint:
Hypotension

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
63M with PMH schizophrenia, CVA w/ R hemiparesis, COPD, colonic
dysmotility recently admitted [**Date range (1) 23929**] for sigmoid
pseudo-obstruction treated with NGT and rectal tube
decompression.  He was also found to have fever, leukocytosis
and wedge-shaped deformity in L kidney on CT consistent with
pyelonephritis, was treated with 2 days of zosyn. A UA showed 19
WBC but no bacteria, so antibiotics were discontinued. On [**10-31**]
after pt discharged, [**1-11**] blood cx + for pan-sensitive GNR.

He represents to ED today from rehab with increasing fatigue and
abdominal distension, found to have systolic blood pressure of
70, given 2L IVF bolus and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] ED.

In ED initial vitals were 98.4 109 81/48 22 98% 4L, he was given
4L IV bolus and systolic blood pressure came up to 100.  A right
IJ CVL was placed and he received cefepime, flagyl, and
vancomycin. A CT scan showed redemonstration of wedged shaped
areas of poor perfusion in L renal lower pole with minimally
increased perinephric fluid suggesting pyelonephritis and b/l
ureteral dilation with transition points in the distal pelvis.
ACS was consulted given abdominal distension and determined
there was no obstruction, but persistent dilated colon with
large fecal load in sigmoid and rectum. They recommended bowel
regimen and consider rectal tube decompression. Prior to
transfer, SBP was in the 70's and he was started on 0.12 of
norepinepherine.

Upon transfer to the MICU, SBP is in the 90's. Patient reports
severe L flank pain and abdominal distension. History is limited
by attention and mild disorientation (alert but O x 1), but he
does also reports subjective fevers, dizziness and recent
diarrhea.

IMAGING

[**11-2**] KUB IMPRESSION:  Marked bowel distention, similar compared
to [**2124-10-27**].

[**11-2**] CXR The heart size is normal.  The mediastinal and hilar
contours are unchanged with tortuosity of the thoracic aorta
again noted.  There is no pulmonary vascular congestion.
Streaky linear opacities in the bases are compatible with
subsegmental atelectasis.  No focal consolidation, pleural
effusion or pneumothorax is present.  Interposition of the colon
between the diaphragm and liver is noted on the right.
Distended bowel loops are partially imaged within the upper
abdomen. IMPRESSION:
Mild bibasilar atelectasis.

[**11-2**] CT Abd/Pelvis
IMPRESSION:
1.  Redemonstration, though less conspicuous, of wedge-shaped
areas of poor perfusion in the left renal lower pole with mildly
increased surrounding perinephric stranding, suggesting
pyelonephritis.
2. Significant dilatation of the midportions of the bilateral
ureters, left greater than right with collapse of the distal
ureters and no hydronephrosis of renal cortical thinning to
suggest acute or chronic obstructive process. Findings could
relate to megaureter, despite the distal ureters appearing
normal in caliber. Further evaluation with MRI can be obtained
to assess for a source of the ureteral caliber change.
3.  Significant stool burden within the rectum and sigmoid colon
with massive upstream gas-filled distention of the colon
consistent with provided diagnosis of pseudo-obstruction.  No
surrounding inflammatory changes to suggest proctitis.
4.  2.3 x 2.2 x 2.3 cm lobulated pericolonic lesion adjacent to
the sigmoid colon, potentially a soft tissue mass. This too can
be further assessed with MRI.



Brief Hospital Course:
63M with paranoid schizophrenia, seizure disorder, CVA with
residual right hemiparesis, COPD, hyperlipidemia, HTN and recent
admission for pseudo-obstruction of his sigmoid colon. CT during
prior admission showed a wedge-shaped deformity in L kidney on
CT consistent with pyelonephritis. After discharge, blood
cultures grew E. coli. He now represents with hypotension and
leukocytosis concerning for sepsis.

ACTIVE ISSUES:

#Colonic pseudoobstruction.  Per notes patient has a history of
chronic colonic motility dysfunction.  Reportedly has had
evaluation at [**Hospital3 **] although I do not have that
information, I suspect it may be due to central autonomic
dysfunction secondary to CVA.  CT on admission showed that the
colon was dilated and filled with air and fluid, slightly
increased compared to recent prior study with significant fecal
load in the rectum and sigmoid colon.  In MICU he received
rectal tube but did not have improvement in distension and this
was removed prior to arrival to the floor.  NGT was placed but
it was self d/c'd 12hrs later.  Rectal exam on the floor did not
show stool impaction and dulcolax suppository and enema did not
releive distension and constipation.  2mg IV neostigmine was
administered on [**11-5**] evening with substantial improvement in
his distension and passage of large volume of liquid stool. One
study showed that use of PEG after neostigmine resulted in lower
risk of recurrence. Following this he was restarted on his home
bowel regimen with polyethylene glycol and docusate liquid as
well as milk of magnesium and psyillium. Offending medications
(CCB, opiates) were avoided. His  calcium channel blocker was
stopped. His diet was advanced and he tolerated a regular diet.
At discharge his abdomen was soft and non-tender but was
distended.
.
# Sepsis / Pyelonephritis: Upon admission, patient met criteria
for sepsis with a suspected renal source.  Blood culture from
recent admission grew E.coli . His CT scan and physical exam
were consistent with a left pyelonephritis.  Patient was
initially started on broad spectrum antibiotics but then
transitioned to ceftriaxone. It was discovered that patient was
not given a dose on [**2122-11-5**], w
