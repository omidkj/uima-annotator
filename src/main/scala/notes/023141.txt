Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the ACS service on [**2122-4-16**]. She
underwent incision and drainage of a R submandibular abscess
with extraction of tooth #31. (Please see operative report for
further details.) Post-operatively the patient was intially
managed in the ICU. She was extubated the next day without
problems. NGT was in place and was pulled on [**2122-4-18**]. The
patient was initially maintained on IV pain medications, but
this was tranisitioned to po pain meds when patient was
tolerating oral intake. The patient was kept on unasyn during
her stay, and this was transitioned to augmentin on discharge.
The patient had some nausea with emesis initially postop, but
this soon resolved. The patient's diet was advanced to
mechanical soft solid and was well tolerated. The patient's
penrose drains were removed prior to discharge. At time of
discharge, patient was doing well, pain well controlled, voiding
independently, tolerating soft solid diet without any nausea or
emesis. She will be sent home on 10 days of augmentin and will
follow up with OMFS as an outpatient.
