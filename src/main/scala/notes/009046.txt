Service: SURGERY

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 473**]
Chief Complaint:
Duodenal and Ampullary Adenoma

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
1. Pancreatoduodenectomy (Whipple procedure).
2. Open cholecystectomy.
3. Extensive lysis of adhesions.


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 67-year-old
man who comes from a family with a deep history of both
colorectal cancer and polyposis as well as duodenal
adenomatous disease, some family members of which have
undergone duodenectomy.  He has recently presented with
endoscopic evidence of a progressive duodenal and ampullary
adenoma, which is extending up into the inferior bile duct.
It cannot be removed endoscopically and has adenomatous
disease has been biopsy proven.  There has been no pancreatic
or biliary ductal or duodenal obstruction.  In light of this,
he is referred for consideration of elective
pancreatoduodenectomy,

The patient states that he was originally diagnosed with
familial
adenomatous polyposis back in the [**2138**] to [**2148**] where he
underwent a total abdominal colectomy for polyposis syndrome.
Since then he has done quite well.  He had been following a
gastroenterologist.  However, he had been lost to followup for
approximately 8 years.  He recently sought the care of Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 78664**] at [**Hospital3 17921**] Center for an abdominal pain syndrome
that he has been having.  He states that the pain is sharp in
nature, located in his periumbilical region and worsens with
eating.  He denies any nausea or vomiting associated with this.
He denies any hematemesis or coffee-ground emesis.  He denies
any
bright-red blood per rectum or diarrhea.  He does state that he
has been experiencing the symptomatology for quite some time.
Based on this, he underwent imaging as well as an endoscopy.  I
do not have the results of the imaging but the endoscopy did
show
a 1.5 cm polyp at the ampulla.  Based on this he was referred to
us for further evaluation and management of his ampulla.


Past Medical History:
His medical history is again significant for a likely diagnosis
of familial adenomatous polyposis, hypertension, coronary artery
disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), arthritis
and peripheral vascular disease.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY
His past surgical history is significant for coronary artery
bypass graft (CABG) and carotid endarterectomy.


Social History:
SOCIAL HISTORY
His social history is significant for positive tobacco.  He
smokes half pack per day, no alcohol and no IV drugs use, and no
intranasal cocaine use.


Family History:
His family history is significant for his maternal grandfather
that was affected with colorectal cancer, mother that was
affected with polyposis, brother that was affected with
colorectal cancer, 2 daughters that are affected with polyposis,
a grandson that is affected with polyposis, a brother that was
lost to colorectal cancer and a son that is also affected with
polyposis.


Physical Exam:
On examination today he appeared in no distress, he was alert
and
oriented x 3.  His vital signs were stable.  He is afebrile.  On
exam HEENT pupils are equal, round and reactive to light,
extraocular muscles were intact.  The mucus membranes were
moist.
Neck was supple.  There was no jugular venous distention (JVD).
His chest was clear to auscultation, bilaterally.  Heart was
regular rate and rhythm.  The abdomen is soft, nontender and
nondistended with normoactive bowel sounds.  The extremities
have
no cyanosis, erythema or edema.  Neurologically, cranial nerves
II-XII were grossly intact, no focal deficits.

FINDINGS: In comparison with study of [**7-4**], there is little
change.
Persistent blunting of the left costophrenic angle consistent
with pleural
fluid and atelectatic changes. Similar, though less marked
changes are seen
on the right. The pulmonary vessels appear somewhat less
prominent, possibly
reflecting some improvement in pulmonary venous pressure status.
Catheters
remain in place.
IMPRESSION: Little change except for possibly some improvement
in pulmonary vascular status.

(Complete) Conclusions
The left atrium is elongated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly
depressed (LVEF= 40-50 %) secondary to hypokinesis of the
inferior and posterior walls. There is no ventricular septal
defect. The right ventricular cavity is dilated with borderline
normal free wall function. The ascending aorta is mildly
dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but
aortic stenosis is not present. Trace aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is
no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is
normal. There is no pericardial effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 67 year old male with ampullary polyp who went to the
OR on [**2187-7-3**] for:
1. Pancreatoduodenectomy (Whipple procedure).
2. Open cholecystectomy.
3. Extensive lysis of adhesions.

He followed the "Whipple" pathway.
Pain: He had an epidural for pain control and was followed by
APS. The epidural, per the pathway, was removed on POD 4. He was
transitioned to a PCA and then oral pain medications once
tolerating a diet.

Post-op Pulmonary Edema: He was Triggered for O2 sat 88 on 2L;
60yr h/o smoking, COPD; CXR showed slightly more vascular
congestion; EKG essentially normal; ABG NL with O2 in 70s; given
nebs, venti mask; and was transferred to the ICU as his cardiac
enzymes were rising. He had a cardiology consult who felt this
was not a MI, but rather a pulmonary overload (demand is
