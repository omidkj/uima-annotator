Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 10552**]
Chief Complaint:
Hypotension

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 19672**] is an 82 year old woman with a past medical history
significant for dementia, DM 2, CAD s/p CABG, systolic CHF
hypothyroid, known UTI, and two recent admissions for UGIB/CoNS
bacteremia and AMS/ARF now admitted with hypotension from
presumed urosepsis. The patient's daughter states that last week
she has had intermitent vomiting described as NBNB emesis every
3-4 days and lethargy. She had a urinalysis and urine culture
drawn last Friday, and was called by her PCPs office yesterday
and was prescribed nitrofurantoin.  Of note, the patient has had
a chronic indwelling foley catheter since [**3-7**], with a voiding
cystogram done on [**4-2**] that was unremarkable. Over the past week,
her daughter reports that she has had decreased PO intake, and
this afternoon was found to be lethargic. At that point, she was
brought into the [**Hospital1 18**] ED for further evaluation.
.
Of note, the patient presented to the ED on [**3-4**] for abdominal
pain. At that time, she was evaluated by Surgery and felt to not
have an acute process and was found to have pyuria on UA treated
with 3 days of cipro 250 mg daily with no urine culture sent.
She was also admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] from [**Date range (1) 19675**] for AMS felt to be
secondary to ARF. During that admission, she failed a voiding
trial and has since had a chronic indwelling foley cathter. In
addition, she was admitted for [**Hospital1 18**] from [**Date range (1) 19676**] for a
duodenal ulcer bleed requiring 6 units PRBC transfusion with
hospital course complicated by CoNS bacteremia treated with 7
days of vancomycin.
.
In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, initial VS 98.8 75 69/34 14 99%RA.  Labs
notable for a lactate of 3.3 down trending to 3 and a UA with
>100 WBC with <1 epithelial. The patient received vanco,
levofloxacin, flagyl, 100 mg hydrocortisone, and 6L IVF, and was
then admitted to the MICU for further management.
.
Currently, the patient is resting comfortably. On ROS, she
endorses pain with palpation of her chest, shoulders, back, and
abdomen.

IMAGING:
PCXR: FINDINGS: Single AP upright portable view of the chest was
obtained. The patient is status post median sternotomy and CABG.
No focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax is
seen. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouette, and the hilar
contours are stable.
IMPRESSION: No significant interval change. No focal
consolidation seen.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 19672**] is an 82 year old woman with a past medical history
significant for dementia, DM 2, CAD s/p CABG, systolic CHF,
hypothyroid, known UTI, and two recent admissions for UGIB/CoNS
bacteremia and AMS/ARF now admitted with hypotension.

1. Hypotension: Given pyuria on UA consistent with UTI,
hypotension likely in part caused by urosepsis, although lack of
>WBC/<WBC, tachycardia, or tachypnea is inconsistent with SIRS
physiology for UTI.  In addition, intravascular volume depletion
in setting of decreased PO intake likely contributing a great
deal, as the hemodynamics and lactate improved after 8L IVF.
Patient was was treated broadly with linezolid and meropenem
given history of VRE and prolonged use of ciprofloxacin for
recurrent UTIs. Antihypertensives and furosemide held at
admission and only furosemide and lisinopril restarted at
discharge. Carvedilol should be reintroduced as soon as BP and
HR tolerates, hopefully at PCP visit [**Name9 (PRE) 766**] or Tuesday. SBPs
ranged 110-140 on day of discharge without tachycardia. BP check
to be done by VNA on day after discharge.

2. UTI: Patient was was treated broadly with linezolid and
meropenem given history of VRE and prolonged use of
ciprofloxacin for recurrent UTIs. Antibiotic coverage was
narrowed to PO linezolid 600mg [**Hospital1 **] x total 7 days at time of
discharge. This decision was based on urine culture report
obtained from Quest lab, ordered by PCP prior to admission which
showed E. faecium >100K organisms, sensitive to linezolid. Foley
replaced at admission.

3. Hyponatremia: Likely in setting of intravascular hypovolemia.
Resolved with IVF.

4. Renal failure: Cr improved to baseline 0.9-1 after IVF. ACEI
and furosemide held during admission.

5. Anemia: Hct at baseline and stable this admission.

6. Goals of care: D
