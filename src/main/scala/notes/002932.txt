Brief Hospital Course:
84 yo M with 2 days of headache and weakness presented to
OSH and was found to have subdural hematoma.  Pt is
anticoagulated on Coumadin for mechanical heart valve.  Pt was
given 2 units of FFP and 10 mg IV vitamin K. Pt was confused on
admission to [**Hospital1 18**], but moving all extremities with intact
facial
expression.  Pt's mental status decreased s/p ED admission, and
pt was intubated for GCS 5.

Patient was taken to the OR emergently for a sub occipital
craniotomy for evacuation of the SDH. He went to the ICU where
he was found to have a LLL PNA and antibiotic therapy with
vancomycin and Zosyn was started.

Heparin drip was started on [**2-10**] to start anticoagulation given
the patients mechanical heart valve and incidentally on [**2-11**] a
left upper extremity DVT was diagnosed.

On [**2-15**] patient was noted to be increasingly lethargic and
continuously tachypneic, a pulmonary consult was obtained, they
perceived his tachypneic to be central in nature. On this day,
pt. was also noted to have CSF leaking from his incision, an
additional staple was placed at the site of the leak and the
drainage stopped, but the wound eventually opened and he had to
be taken back to the OR for a wound revision which happened on
[**2135-2-21**].

On this hospital stay, the patient failed multiple swallow
evaluations by speech therapy and received a surgical PEG by GI
on [**2135-2-21**].

On the day of discharge, [**2135-2-23**] pt. was evaluated for the
development of hydrocephalus via CT scan which was negative.
Anticoagulation was initiated with IV heparin for both his upper
extremity DVT and his pre-existing mechanical heart valve.  He
will go to rehab with on going therapy and he is to be monitored
closely there.
