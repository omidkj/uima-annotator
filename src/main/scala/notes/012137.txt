Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1167**]
Chief Complaint:
fever, hypoxia


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Central venous catheterization

History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **] yo Russian speaking male with sCHF (~ 36% on echo [**3-/2184**]),
CAD, critical AS < 0.8 cm^2, COPD on 2L NC (FEV1 121% in [**2179**])
presents from [**Hospital1 100**] Senior Life with fever up to 103,
tachycardia to 110s, and reported hypoxia down to 66% on RA.

Per report, patient was given Tylenol 650 mg at 9PM and then
brought in by EMS for further evaluation.  He was placed on NRB.

Upon arrival to the ED, VS 102.5 110 107/53 32 98% 10L NRB.
Apparently patient was oriented and denied any complaints, such
as fever, chest pain, SOB, any other pain.  He was noted to be
drowsy on exam.  There was concern for PNA although CXR was per
report without obvious infiltrate.  He was tried on
non-invasives, but it did not improve his respiratory status,
had poor seal, and in fact, patient constantly tried to take the
mask off.  He was given vancomycin and zosyn for presumed
pneumonia.  Then, UA was found to be grossly positive.  He was
also noted to be hypotensive to SBP in the 70s.  LIJ was placed
and he received 1 L of IVF.  Upon transfer, VS 94 92/48 35 97%
NRB

On the floor, patient was awake.  He denied any pain.  He stated
to the daughter over the phone that he was comfortable.

MICROBIOLOGY
Legionella Urinary Antigen  (Final [**2184-12-4**]):
      NEGATIVE FOR LEGIONELLA SEROGROUP 1 ANTIGEN.
           (Reference Range-Negative).
Performed by Immunochromogenic assay.
A negative result does not rule out infection due to other L.
pneumophila serogroups or other Legionella species. Furthermore,
in infected patients the excretion of antigen in urine may vary.

Urine [**12-3**] - positive for pansensitive E.coli

.
CXR [**12-3**]
FINDINGS: Single AP upright portable view of the chest was
obtained. The patient is status post median sternotomy. There
are low lung volumes. Blunting of the right costophrenic angle
may be due to a trace effusion. Subtle bilateral patchy
opacities may relate to infection versus mild volume overload.
Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable. No pneumothorax.

.
CXR [**12-10**]
In comparison with the study of [**11-7**], there is again
enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with substantial pulmonary
edema and bilateral pleural effusions with compressive
atelectasis at the bases.
.
ECHO [**12-7**]
The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is moderately dilated.
There is mild to moderate global left ventricular hypokinesis
(LVEF = 35-40%). Right ventricular chamber size is normal with
mild global free wall hypokinesis. The aortic valve leaflets are
severely thickened/deformed. There is critical aortic valve
stenosis (valve area <0.8cm2). Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is
no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. There is no pericardial effusion.
.
IMPRESSION: Dilated left ventricle with mild to moderate global
systolic dysfunction. Mild right ventricular systolic
dysfunction. Critical calcific aortic stenosis. Mild aortic
regurgitation. Mild mitral regurgitation.


Brief Hospital Course:
[**Age over 90 **] yo Russian speaking male with critical aortic stenosis and
systolic CHF as well as COPD on 2L O2 by nasal cannula at
baseline presenting from [**Hospital1 100**] Senior Life with rigors, fever
to 103, tachycardia and hypoxia in the setting of UTI.

1) Acute on chronic systolic heart failure/chronic AS: The
patient has known critical AS and is not an operative candidate
due to age and recent comorbid conditions (percutaneous valve
was considered at one time but likely not feasible at this time
given multiple recent medical issues).  On admission he was
