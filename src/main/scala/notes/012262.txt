Neck plain films:
SOFT TISSUE NECK, FRONTAL AND LATERAL VIEWS: The hypopharynx is
air
distended, although no definite foreign body is identified. Soft
tissue in
the hypopharynx likely reflects the larynx. The epiglottis is
normal. There
are degenerative changes of the cervical spine which is
incompletely
evaluated. There is no prevertebral swelling.

IMPRESSION: Distension of hypopharynx. However, no foreign body
is
identified. Correlation with direct visualization is
recommended.

The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.
