CT Abd/Pelvis:
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of colitis or acute intra-abdominal process.
2. Vague fat density adjacent to the sigmoid colon likely
reflects a normal branching pattern of mesocolic vessels;
considered unlikely to represent epiploic appendagitis.
3. Fatty liver.
4. Atherosclerotic calcification of the abdominal aorta.
5. Chronic appearance of right middle lobe consolidation, likely
chronic/rounded atelectasis.


Brief Hospital Course:
# EtOH withdrawal: Somnolent but interactive at the time of
admission, and not cooperative, though not tremulous.  After
hydration and antibiotics overnight, patient was fully oriented,
no tremulousness or asterixis.  Patient required valium
approximately every 6 hours overnight his first night of
admission.  He was continued on a CIWA scale, received banana
bag in ED, and was continued on thiamine, folate IV x3 days,
multivitamin.  He was subsequently discontinued off of valium,
and did not require further benzodiazepine.  He refused further
social work assistance regarding sobriety.
.
# Abdominal pain: On presentation, he complained of abdominal
pain, diffuse throughout his abdomen, with nausea and vomiting.
He had an abdominal CT scan that showede no evidence of colitis
or gastroenteritis.  Stool studies were negative for infectious
pathogens, although clostridium dificile was not sent.  He was
given IVF and antiemetics.  He was seen by the gastroenterology
service, who concluded that this was likely viral
gastroenteritis with post infectious pain syndrome, possible
exacerbated by chronic abdominal pain.  He was a difficult
historian given underlying history of severe alcohol abuse.  He
was treated with twice daily protonix, maalox and lidocaine.  He
was discharged off of pain medications, with direction to follow
up with gastroenterology if the pain persisted.  He did continue
to have pain and have decreased oral intake throughout his stay.

.
# Acute renal failure: He was admitted with a creatinine of 1.7,
which improved with hydration.  This was due to dehydration.
.
# Coronary artery disease: continued aspirin
.
# Cognitive deficits:  He has had neuropsychiatric testing done
as an outpatient, which showed evidence of cognitive deficits,
likely from heavy alcohol abuse.  He was seen by psychiatry here
in the hospital, but there was no acute psychiatric issue
present, aside from his substance abuse.  He also has a history
of violent behavior, and on the day prior to discharge, a code
purple was called after he appeared to throw his tray on the
floor and start to scream expletives.  After this episode, based
on Mr. [**Known lastname 90958**] request, his care was transitioned from me,
[**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 1060**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1520**], to Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], who discharged him the
following day.
