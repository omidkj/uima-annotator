Brief Hospital Course:
80 year old male with DM, recurrent UTI, Paget's, s/p recent
subdural hematoma evacuation admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] w/ respiratory
failure found to have MRSA pna VRE urosepsis, now improved,
called out of [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] to medicine.
.
# Respiratory distress: Patient was in acute respiratory
distress on admission to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].  He was noted to have thick
bloody secretions on deep suctioning with visible food
particles.  He was intubated and a bronchoscopy was performed on
[**6-18**] which showed inflamed friable mucosa with moderately thick
mucous in the LLL bronchus.  No foreign body was visualized and
a BAL was sent for culture.
His acute respiratory distress was attributed to aspiration PNA
and urosepsis, however, his CXR on [**6-19**] was concerning for
possible ARDS.  He was started on protective ARDS vent settings.
 He was extubated successfully on [**6-20**].  His sputum culture
eventually grew MRSA and patient was continued on Linezolid for
coverage of MRSA PNA and VRE UTI.  Pt also developed pulmonary
edema from fluids that were received, and received lasix for
diuresis with good effects.  Pt's O2 was weaned as tolerated. At
the time of dicharge, pt was satting at 95% on RA.
.
# VRE urosepsis/aspiration, MRSA pneumonia: Patient was admitted
to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for sepsis given hypotension, hypoxia, tachycardia,
fever and leukocytosis. The pt was noted to have a UTI.  A
culture sent from the ED grew out enterococcus and patient was
noted to have bibasilar consolidations R > L accompanied by
small-to-moderate pleural effusions concerning for PNA.  Patient
was started on Vancomycin, Levofloxacin, and Zosyn.
Blood cultures were sent from the ED remained NGTD.  However,
urine cx returned positive for VRE, and patient was started on
Linezolid IV for coverage of his MRSA PNA and VRE UTI.  The BAL
also came back + for MRSA which is covered by linezolid.
Attempted to d/c foley and pt unable to void after trial and
foley was replaced. Will need another voiding trial after
treatment of UTI.
.
# Hypotension:  Patient arrived from the ED on Levophed.  He was
aggressively fluid resuscitated and he was weaned off the
levophed on [**6-19**].  It was noted that the patient was developing
a non-gap hyperchloremic acidosis from the normal saline which
had been used for volume resusciation so his IVF was changed to
lactated ringers with good resolution.  On [**6-18**] he failed his
[**Last Name (un) 104**] stim test and was started on stress-dose steroids.  His
blood pressure stablized and his steroids were continued.  IV
steroid was switched to po and po steroids tapered to off on
[**6-24**].
.
# Mental status changes:  Patient is s/p subdural hematoma
evacuation
