disease.  She was then seen in [**Hospital 3585**] Clinic in [**2196-4-5**].  She had the usual preoperative workup.  At that time
she was not complaining of any abdominal pain.  No nausea,
vomiting, chest pain or shortness of breath.  She seemed a
little fatigued but otherwise she was doing well.  The
patient presented on [**2196-6-13**], for orthotopic liver
transplant which took place on [**2196-6-14**].

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Ms. [**Known lastname 15499**] is a 60-year-old female with
primary biliary cirrhosis and portal hypertension with one
bout of preoperative encephalopathy and no history of bleeds
who underwent an orthotopic liver transplant on [**2196-6-14**].  Intraoperatively the course was remarkable for an
increase in the pulmonary artery pressures, systolic 60-70's,
mean in the 50's, particularly post.  New line placed.  The
patient was refractory to nitroglycerin, calcium channel
blockers.  Otherwise hemodynamically stable.  The patient did
have some lateral ST depressions, however, transesophageal
echocardiogram intraoperatively indicated no wall motion
abnormalities and she was brought to the Surgical Intensive
Care Unit intubated.  The patient was kept at pulmonary
artery pressures around 35 which was equivalent to patient's
baseline.  The patient was running 50's over 20 on nitric
oxide.  At that point she was placed on an immunosuppressive
regimen of mycophenolate mofetil and methylprednisolone as
well as the usual prophylactic agents.  To control blood
pressure she was placed on metoprolol 5 mg q. 6h. as well as
nitroglycerin and hydralazine p.r.n.

Pulmonary hypertension.  There was a question of whether it
was volume related.  Mean pulse pressure decreased by 10 on
nitric oxide if it was agreed with diureses.  The patient was
making good urine output and she was ruling out for
myocardial infarction.  The patient was placed on imipenem.
The patient had a duplex ultrasound of the transplanted liver
on [**2196-6-15**], which indicated normal evaluation of the
hepatic artery, portal vein and extrahepatic vein.  There
were two hemangiomas demonstrated with the liver.  On the
liver function tests at that point her ALT was 383 down from
400.  Her AST was 441 down from 652.  Her alk phos was 116
and her T. bilirubin was 2.0 and her D. bilirubin was 1.2.
The patient had an echocardiogram on [**6-15**] which showed
moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy, a normal
left ventricular cavity size and an ejection fraction of 55%.
There was mild 1+ aortic regurgitation, 1+ mitral
regurgitation and moderate 2+ tricuspid regurgitation and
there was moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.

On postoperative day three she was making 3.6 liters of
urine.  She was being weaned off of nitric oxide.  The
patient was receiving Lasix b.i.d.  On postoperative day two
fluid balance was positive ten liters so far.  Diuresis was
planned before weaning from vent.  Cardiology had been
consulted for increase in pulmonary artery pressures as well
as to rule out any evidence of acute ischemic event.  The
patient was seen by the Pulmonary Hypertensive Service.  On
postoperative day four, the patient was extubated.  The
pulmonary artery pressure was less than 40, and the PA catheter
was removed. The patient was a
little confused but oriented to time, place.  At that point
she was placed on enalapril for blood pressure control in
addition to hydralazine and clonidine.  By postoperative day
seven, the patient was tolerating clears as well as being at
goal TPN since [**6-19**].  On the 15th [**Hospital **] Clinic was
consulted for blood sugar management secondary to steroids.
The patient was stable and transferred to the floor.  By
postoperative day nine, on examination the patient's abdomen
was soft, minimally distended with some peri-incisional
tenderness.  The wound was clean, dry and intact.  There was
a slight increase in total bilirubin to 1.9 from 0.8.  She
had a liver ultrasound which showed adequate flow and no
obstruction.  By postoperative day ten, the patient had an
increase in liver function tests which prompted a liver
biopsy which indicated portal neutrophilic infiltrate with
acute cholangitis and mild duct proliferation.  There was no
acute cellular rejection seen and there was minimal
lobular cholestasis and focal minimal lobular neutrophilic
infiltrate.  Since liver function tests were rising,
cholangitis was suspected so she was started on intravenous
levofloxacin q. day.  ERCP showed a biliary
anastomotic stricture, therefore sphincterotomy with stent
placement was performed.  The
patient's transaminases were increasing and her hematocrit
had decreased to 20.  On [**2196-6-27**], the patient underwent
an ultrasound of the abdomen which showed a large
peritransplant hematoma with likely intraparenchymal
component so the patient underwent a re-exploration of the
abdomen with a liver biopsy and revision of the common bile
duct and anastomosis.  The patient postoperatively was
readmitted to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit on the 23rd
intubated.  The patient had another duplex ultrasound of the
abdomen the following day which showed no definite
subcapsular hematoma and a normal Doppler evaluation of the
liver.  The patient was extubated stable on nitroglycerin.
The patient was transferred to the floor on postoperative day
16 and number three.  Her blood pressure, however, continued to
be
elevated with systolic blood pressures in the 170's.  She was
continued on Lopressor 50 mg b.i.d., Lasix 20 IV and given
hydralazine.  By postoperative day 17 and five, the patient
was tolerating regular diet and her abdominal pain was well
controlled with Percocet.  She was being evaluated by
Physical Therapy and Occupational Therapy.  On postoperative
day 19 and six, the patient became a little confused and
removed her central line from her neck.  Her oxygen
saturation had decreased to 85%.  She was immediately placed
on higher oxygen levels.  The patient returned to oxygen
saturations greater than 95%.  Cardiology was consulted and a
Swan catheter placed to check pulmonary artery pressures once
again.  Neurology was consulted for mental status changes.
They felt that her mental status examination was essentially
normal.  They felt the m
