Brief Hospital Course:
Patient had her pre-operative work-up as an out patient and was
a same day admit. On [**3-14**] she was brought directly to the
operating room where she underwent an Aortic Valve Replacement.
Please see op note for surgical details. She tolerated the
procedure well and was brought to the CSRU in stable condition
on minimal Inotropic support. Patient was transfused to keep hct
approximately 30. Later on op day she was weaned from sedation,
awoke neurologically intact and was extubated. Inotropes were
weaned by post-op day one and she was started on a Nitro gtt for
hypertension. B blockers and diuretics were initiated and she
was gently diuresed throughout her post-op course. Chest tubes
were removed on post-op day one and she was then transferred to
the cardiac surgery step-down unit. Pre-operative medications
were started for her Polycythemia [**Doctor First Name **] and Myelodysplastic
Syndrome. Her labs were stable throughout her hospital course
with slight increase in her creatinine that came down to
baseline at time of discharge. Also, her WBC remained quite
elevated throughout hospital course (reaching over 70,000 on
POD#2) and eventually coming down to 47,000 at time of
discharge. Her epicardial pacing wires were removed on post-op
day three. Physical therapy followed her during entire post-op
course for strength and mobility. She improved rather well and
was at level 5 by post-op day 4. She remained slightly above her
pre-op weight and was discharged with diuretics. She was
discharged home on post-op day four with VNA services and
appropriate follow-up appointments.
