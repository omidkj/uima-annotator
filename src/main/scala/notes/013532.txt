Service:  MICU

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Transferred for a stent for a right
mainstem bronchus obstruction with squamous cell carcinoma.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 70-year-old female
admitted to [**Hospital 2079**] Hospital from [**5-30**] through [**6-18**]
for dyspnea which was felt secondary to congestive heart
failure.

She was treated for congestive heart failure first as a
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease flare during that time
and was discharged on [**6-18**].

On [**6-19**], she returned to the hospital because of some
right-sided pleuritic chest pain.  Chest x-ray showed a
density at the right base with right mediastinal shift.  A CT
of the chest showed complete collapse of the right lower lobe
secondary to an endobronchial lesion.

There was no evidence of pulmonary embolus.  There was also
no evidence of any pleural or pericardial effusion.  She also
reportedly had some mediastinal adenopathy and a right hilar
mass, reported visible on chest x-rays from [**2106-9-19**],
with indeterminate follow-up mediastinoscopy.

She was admitted at that point on [**6-19**] for bronchoscopy for
biopsy of the right mainstem endobronchial lesion.  The
pathology returned that day positive for squamous cell
carcinoma.

The patient was accepted by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) **] of Interventional
Pulmonology here at [**Hospital6 256**] for
bronchoscopy and intervention, and the patient was
transferred on [**6-21**].

SOCIAL HISTORY:  This is a 1?????? pack-per-day smoker for 45
years until stopping one year ago.  She denied alcohol.  She
lives with her husband and has two sons and one daughter.
She is a retired clerk.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs:  On presentation
temperature was 97.6??????, heart rate 95, blood pressure 170/48,
respirations 20.  General:  She was an intubated and obese
woman in no apparent distress, but anxious.  She was
attempting to communicate verbally while intubated.  HEENT:
Pupils equal, round and reactive to light.  Oropharynx moist.
Chest:  Clear breath sounds on the left but coarse breath
sounds on the right superiorly, with absent breath sounds
inferiorly.  Cardiovascular:  Regular, rate and rhythm.
Normal S1 and S2.  Without murmurs.  Abdomen:  Obese.  Soft,
nontender, nondistended.  Positive bowel sounds.
Extremities:  There was mild, chronic venostasis changes
without any peripheral edema.

LABORATORY DATA:  From [**Hospital 2079**] Hospital white count was
20.2, hematocrit 45.3, platelet count 209; CHEM7 with a
sodium of 137, potassium 4.7, chloride 98, bicarb 30, BUN 22,
creatinine 0.8, glucose 189; LFTs were unremarkable.

Chest x-ray done at the outside revealed volume loss, likely
postobstructive collapse involving the right lung with
associated atelectasis.

Chest CT done on [**6-19**] showed complete collapse of the right
lower lobe secondary to endobronchial lesion.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  1.  Respiratory distress:  This was thought
to be likely due to endobronchial lesion with postlesion
obstruction and collapse of the right lung.  The patient was
oxygenating and ventilating well on a ventilator when she
arrived, and this was kept on those settings on the first
night and switched over to pressure support ventilation.

She received a CT of the airway with reconstruction and
preparation for the rigid interventional bronchoscopy.  She
went to Interventional Bronchoscopy on [**6-22**], which revealed
a mass within the right mainstem bronchus occluding the
origin of the right upper lobe bronchus, measuring
approximately 13 x 9 mm in diameter.

This was excised by Interventional Pulmonology, and the
patient returned to the MICU status post excision without
endobronchial stent.

After the bronchoscopy, she did have six weeks of
nonsustained ventricular tachycardia.  She remained
ventilated with intravenous sedation and was gradually weaned
off and extubated on [**6-23**].

Initially she did have some thick secretions through her
stent which was sent to microbiopsy for speciation, and these
eventually grew out pseudomonas sensitive to everything
except for ...................  She therefore had initially
been started on Zosyn, as well as Levofloxacin and Vancomycin
upon admission for the leukocytosis, and gradually her
antibiotic regimen was narrowed down to just Zosyn for the
pseudomonas pneumonia.  At the time of this dictation, she is
currently on day #7 of a 10-day course of intravenous Zosyn
for the pseudomonas.

After extubation on the 5th, the patient continued to have
some respiratory distress and required face mask, as well as
sedation.  Her arterial blood gases continued to show
adequate ventilation.  Her respiratory distress was felt to
be multifactorial from the pseudomonas pneumonia, the
possible reactive airway disease flare, and flash pulmonary
edema.

She was diuresed gently with a one-time dose of 40 mg Lasix
and also given high-dose steroids and nebulizers to improve
some bronchospastic disease.  She was also felt to be
delirious during this time, and was not tolerating her BIPAP,
which she normally uses at home.

Eventually she became less agitated and was able to tolerate
the face mask with adequate oxygenation and ventilation.  She
was increased on her benzodiazepines, as she did have a
history of taking Xanax more than once a day at home.  She
continued to do well on this regimen, and two days prior to
discharge, she was lucid and oriented and pleasant, doing
well with nasal cannula.

Her lung exam appeared improved with less wheezing and fewer
rhonchi, and her white count decreased to within normal
limits by this time.

On the day before discharge, she was finally able to tolerate
her BIPAP all night, as she does at home, on settings of 14
and 8.  She did not require any further diuresis.

2.  Hypertension and nonsustained ventricular tachycardia:
The patient did have two episodes of nonsustained ventricular
tachycardia throughout her whole hospital course which were
six beats and 11 beats in duration.  She had no chest pain.
It is recommended that she follow-up with Cardiology for risk
stratification for coronary artery disease, as she does have
risk factors.

She was kept on Captopril for hypertension at her Lisinopril
dose equivalent.  She was switched on the day of discharge
back to her standing Lisinopril 20 mg p.o. q.d.

Her Digoxin, which was presumably prescribed by her physician
for congestive heart failure, was discontinued for risk of
any arrhythmia affects; however, she was continued on her
Lipitor and Lisinopril.  She may need to restart Lasix at a
future date and should be followed closely by her primary
care physician.

In addition, another medication change that was made was the
discontinuation of Theophylline.  She will be given inhalers
with bronchodilators and inhalers for control of her reactive
airway disease.

She did have two episodes of atrial fibrillation with rapid
ventricular response which lasted less than a few minutes
each time, resolving spontaneously without medication.  She
was however presc
