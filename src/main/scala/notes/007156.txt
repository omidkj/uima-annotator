Transhiatial esophagectomy [**2180-8-29**]


History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 67465**] is a 74-year-old woman with [**Doctor Last Name 15532**]
esophagus who was undergoing surveillance and was found to
have areas of high grade dysplasia, confirmed by several
pathologists. We discussed a variety of the treatment options
for this. She has very few significant co-morbidities and I
recommended transhiatal esophagectomy. A preoperative PET
scan showed a PET positive lung nodule, which was evaluated
by a video thoracoscopic excision and found to be benign.
Without any other major issues, I recommended proceeding to
esophagectomy and she agreed to proceed.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 67465**] is a 74 year old female who went to the OR on [**8-29**] for
transhiatal esophagectomy who has a Barrett's esophagus with
high grade dysplasia.  She tolerated the procedure well, was
extubated and she was started on strict NPO after the procedure.
 She was sent to the CSRU for observation but was doing really
well that POD #1 she was transferred to the floor.  On POD #2
tube feeds were started at a slow rate.  They were not advance
until POD #5 when she passed flatus and stool.  They were then
advance to goal which she tolerated. POD #3, physical therapy
saw her and felt that she could benefit from endurance training
and with balance. POD#3 her epidural was taken out because it no
longer had a level.  Her pain was well controlled on a PCA.
Also the foley was discontinued and she voided well. She
continued to have the Nasal gastric tube until POD #5 because it
had high output but it was taken out on POD 4.  Once her tube
feeds were advanced we started her on Roxicet elixir and
discontinued the PCA. On POD #7 she a glass of grape juice in
the morning.  There was no grape juice in her JP drain later
that morning so she was started on a clear liquid diet.  She
tolerated her clear liquid diet so her JP was taken out that
evening.  Also early that evening she developed a low grade
fever and a check of the wounds showed erythema around the
abdominal wound and G-tube.  The abdominal wound had some
staples removed at the top of the wound and it was opened.  Pus
was expressed from the wound which was sent for culture.  The
gram stain and culture is still preliminary but has only shown
gram positive bacteria.  The wound has adequate drainage and it
is being changed wet to dry twice a day.  She was also started
on Kefzol.  The erythema has decreased every day and it seems to
be improving.  She also started to have diarrhea numerous times.
 A stool culture was sent for C.diff and it was negative. On POD
#8 she had her diet advance to full liquids which she tolerated.
On POD #9 we decreased her Tube Feeds rate to 65 cc/hour still
at 3/4 strength because of her continued diarrhea and because
she was taking in 3 cans of ensure so she had good calorie
intake. She has had improvement of her diarrhea since we
decreased her tube feeds.  On POD #10, she was doing well and
she was discharged to rehab for physical therapy for
reconditioning, supplemental tube feeds to meet nutritional
needs, and abdominal dressing changes twice a day.
