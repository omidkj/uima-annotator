IDENTIFICATION:  Baby Girl [**Known lastname 71199**], [**Name2 (NI) 37336**] #2, "[**Known lastname **]", is a 106
day old former 25 [**3-20**] wk infant who is being discharged from the
[**Hospital1 18**] Neonatal Intensive Care Unit.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  [**Known lastname **] [**Known lastname 71199**] is the second born
of triplets born at 25-2/7 weeks gestation to a 27-year-old,
G1, P0 woman. Prenatal screens: Blood type O positive,
antibody negative, rubella immune, RPR nonreactive, hepatitis
B surface antigen negative, Group beta strep status negative.
The pregnancy was notable for a conception by in [**Last Name (un) 5153**]
fertilization with 2 embryos resulting in 3 fetuses,
dichorionic/triamniotic gestation. EDC was [**2115-6-25**].
Pregnancy was complicated by diagnosis of twin-to-twin
transfusion at 18 weeks gestation.  This infant #2 was the
recipient and [**Year (4 digits) 37336**] #1 was the donor. This twin required 1
amnio reduction of 800 mL of fluid on [**2115-2-12**]. A
karyotype was sent from that sample and showed chromosomal
analysis of 46 XX.

The mother was noted to have vaginal bleeding on [**2115-2-14**] and was admitted to the [**Hospital1 188**]. She was treated with bed rest. She was again admitted
with cervical changes at 23-3/7 weeks on [**2115-3-1**].
She became beta complete on [**2115-3-3**]. On the day of
delivery she was noted to have significant vaginal bleeding
and the decision was made to deliver in the setting of
advanced cervical changes and concern regarding placental
abruption. The mother's medical history was otherwise
noncontributory. There was no maternal fever. Rupture of
membranes occurred at delivery. Mother received
intraoperative antibiotics. This [**Year (4 digits) 37336**] #2 emerged at C-
section with Apgars of 7 at one minute and 8 at five minutes.
She required intubation in the delivery room and was
transferred to the neonatal intensive care unit for further
care.

Anthropometric measures at birth: Weight 835 gm, 50th
percentile; head circumference 24 cm, 50th percentile; length
32 cm, 50th percentile.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION AT DISCHARGE:  General: Alert,
nondysmorphic infant in room air. Weight 3.46 kg, 75th
percentile; length 49.5 cm, 50th percentile, head
circumference 35.25 cm, 75th-90th percentile. Skin: Warm and
dry, color pink, well perfused. HEENT: Anterior fontanel open
and flat, sutures approximated. Eyes clear. Palate intact.
Neck: Supple, without masses. Chest: Breath sounds equal,
well aerated, mild intercostal retractions. Cardiovascular:
Soft systolic murmur at the left sternal border. Normal S1,
S2. Pulses +2, equal femorals and brachial's. Abdomen: Soft,
nontender, nondistended. Large umbilical hernia, soft and
easily reduced. No organomegaly. GU: Normal female genitalia,
mild labial edema. Extremities: Moves all well. Hips stable.
Neurological: Alert, positive grasp, positive suck, symmetric
tone. Post menstrual age at discharge 40-3/7 weeks gestation.

HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEMS INCLUDING PERTINENT LABORATORY
DATA:
1.  Respiratory: [**Known lastname **] was treated with Surfactant upon
    admission to the neonatal intensive care unit. She
    eventually received 3 doses. She was placed on high
    frequency oscillator ventilator at admission due to
    severity of respiratory distress. She remained on HFOV
    for 3 weeks and then transitioned to continuous positive
    airway pressure following self-extubation. She remained on
    continuous positive airway pressure from [**4-5**]
    through [**2115-5-17**]. At that time, she was placed on a
    high flow nasal cannula O2. She gradually weaned to room
    air by [**2115-6-6**]. She was treated for apnea of
    prematurity with caffeine citrate from [**4-4**] to
    [**2115-5-26**]. Due to her evolving chronic lung disease
    she was started on Lasix 2 mg/kg every Monday, Wednesday,
    Friday. Her last episode of spontaneous bradycardia
    occurred on [**2115-6-23**]. She will be followed in
    pulmonary clinic at [**Hospital3 1810**] with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 4468**]
    [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 37305**]. At the time of discharge, she is breathing
    comfortably in room air with a respiratory rate of 30-70
    breaths per minute. Oxygen saturations in room air are
    greater than 95%. She is being continued on lasix, although
    the dose is no longer being adjusted for weight; she
    is discharged on 6 mg three times a week, approximately
    1.7 mg/kg dose.  Lasix may be able to be discontinued
    in [**4-14**] weeks if infant remains stable.
2.  Cardiovascular: [**Known lastname **] initially had hypotension shortly
    after birth and was treated with dopamine. The dopamine
    was discontinued by day of life #5. An echocardiogram
    performed on day of life #2 showed a 3 mm patent ductus
    arteriosus with right ventricular dilatation. She
    received one course of Indomethacin. Repeat
    echocardiogram on [**2115-3-18**] showed the patent
    ductus arteriosus resolved. A murmur persisted and the
    second post Indomethacin echocardiogram was obtained on
    [**2115-3-20**] that showed right ventricular
    hypertrophy with pulmonary hypertension. An
    echocardiogram on [**2115-3-26**] showed persistence of
    the right ventricular hypertension and a patent foramen
    ovale, with no PDA. Echocardiogram on [**2115-6-15**] showed
    persistence of the patent foramen ovale and right
    ventricular pressures greater than [**2-12**] systemic with mild
    tricuspid regurgitation. A final echocardiogram was
    performed on [**2115-6-26**] which showed mild pulmonary
    hypertension, with right ventricular pressures approximately
    one-half of systemic.  Anatomy was normal, and there was
    normal left ventricular size and systolic function. [**Known lastname **]
    will be followed for her pulmonary hypertension in the
    pulmonary clinic also with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 37305**]. Her baseline heart
    rate is 120-150 beats per minute with a recent blood
    pressure of 83/31 mmHg and a mean arterial pressure of 51
    mm Hg.
3.  Fluids/Electrolytes/Nutrition: [**Known lastname **] was initially NPO and
    maintained on intravenous fluids. She had initially
    umbilical arterial and venous catheters. She had a
    percutaneously inserted central catheter for parenteral
    nutrition. Enteral feedings were started on day of life
    #8 and gradually advanced to full volume. Her maximum
    caloric intake was Similac Special Care formula 30
    calories/ounce. At the time of discharge she is taking
    Similar 20 calorie/ounce by mouth ad lib. She takes 130-
    150 mL/kg/day. Serum electrolytes have remained within
    normal limits, even with the administration of the x
    weekly Lasix. Her most recent electrolytes on [**2115-6-18**]
    had a sodium of 137, a potassium of 4.8, a chloride of
    105, and a total carbon dioxide of 25.
4.  Infectious disease: [**Known lastname **] was evaluated for sepsis upon
    admission to the neonatal intensive care unit. A complete
    blood count with white blood cell differential was within
    normal limits. She received an initial course of 10 days
    of ampicillin and gentamicin due to severity of illness,
    and then had ceftazidime added on day of life #9 due to
    severity of illness. She received a total 14-day
    course of antibiotics. Her blood culture was no growth.
    She did not have any other infectious disease concerns
    during the remainder of her neonatal intensive care unit
    admission.
5.  Hematologic: [**Known lastname **] is blood type O positive and was direct
    antibody test negative. She has received 6 transfusions
    of packed red cells during her admission, the last
    occurring on [**2115-5-6**]. Her most recent hematocrit
    was 30.8% with a reticulocyte count of 4.7% on [**6-26**]. She
    is being discharged home on supplemental iron.
6.  Gastrointestinal: [**Known lastname **] required treatment for
    unconju
