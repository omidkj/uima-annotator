Chief Complaint:
generalized weakness, anorexia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Left internal jugular tunneled hemodialysis catheter [**2184-9-16**]


History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **] y/o [**Age over 90 **] y/o F w/ AFib on coumadin, tachy-brady syndrome s/p
PPM, CKD, and diastolic CHF a/w malaise, weakness, and decreased
PO intake for two days and an episode of urinary incontinence
the night prior to admission. Per the patient's family, she felt
well until 2 days ago when she noted multiple episodes of
diarrhea in the setting of an increase in her laxative regimen
intended to treat constipation and associated abdominal
discomfort. She has not had any recent antibiotic use or health
care exposures. She denies fevers, chills, dysuria, hematuria,
flank pain, or changes in mental status. Family does state that
renal function has steadily declined over the past 6 months for
which she has been followed closely by a nephrologist.

[**2184-9-12**] CHEST RADIOGRAPH, PA AND LATERAL
Dual-lead right pectoral pacemaker with
right atrial and right ventricular leads is unchanged from prior
studies.
Cardiomegaly is again noted, although the right heart border is
now obscured by right basilar opacity which also obscures the
right hemidiaphragm, consistent with moderate-sized pleural
effusion and related atelectasis, although underlying pneumonic
consolidation cannot be excluded. There is also a small left
pleural effusion with milder left retrocardiac atelectasis. The
remainder of the lungs are grossly clear, without evidence of
overt pulmonary edema or lung consolidation . There is no
evidence of pneumothorax. Calcifications are again noted along
the aorta. Old right lateral rib fracture is unchanged.

IMPRESSIONS: Increased right basilar opacity, with increased and
now
moderate-sized right pleural effusion, and related atelectasis,
although
underlying pneumonic consolidation cannot be excluded. Small
left pleural
effusion with left basilar atelectasis.
.
[**2184-9-14**] TTE
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The right atrium is markedly
dilated. The estimated right atrial pressure is 10-20mmHg. Left
ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global
systolic function are normal (LVEF 55-60%). The right
ventricular cavity is moderately dilated with mild global free
wall hypokinesis. There is abnormal diastolic septal
motion/position consistent with right ventricular volume
overload. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but
aortic stenosis is not present. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation
is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild
(1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets
are mildly thickened. The tricuspid valve leaflets fail to fully
coapt. Severe [4+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is
moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. Significant
pulmonic regurgitation is seen. The main pulmonary artery is
dilated. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Dilated right ventricle with mild global systolic
dysfunction and evidence of volume overload. Normal global and
regional left ventricular systolic function. Mild aortic
regurgitation. Mild mitral regurgitation. Severe functional
tricuspid regurgitation.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2184-7-2**],
findings are similar. Left ventricular systolic function may
have been slightly underestimated on the prior study.

[**2184-9-16**] VASCULAR U/S-GUIDED CATHETER PLACEMENT
FINDINGS:
1. Patent left internal jugular vein, accessed under son[**Name (NI) 493**]
guidance.
2. Placement of tunneled 15.5 French x 27 cm cuff-to-tip
angiodynamics
hemodialysis catheter via the left internal jugular vein.
3. Post-procedure chest radiograph showed the catheter tip in
the right
atrium with no kinks along the course of the catheter and no
pneumothorax.

Incidental note is made of atrioventricular pacing wires in
expected position placed through the right subclavian vein.

IMPRESSION: Successful placement of left internal jugular
tunneled
hemodialysis catheter. The catheter is ready for immediate use.


Brief Hospital Course:
#CKD stage IV - The patient presented with symptoms consistent
with uremia. Volume overload was refractory to diuretic therapy
due to worsening renal function. Left IJ tunneled HD catheter
was placed on [**9-16**] with subsequent initiation of hemodialysis
that day, followed by [**9-17**], [**9-18**], [**9-20**], and [**9-21**]. Nephrocaps
were added. Lasix and [**Last Name (un) **] were discontinued. Phosphate binder
therapy was not added as the calcium-phosphate product was
approximately 18. PPD was read as 0 mm induration on [**9-19**]. The
patient will continue to receive HD as an outpatient.
.
#Acute on chronic diastolic CHF - Admission CXR showed a
moderately-sized right pleural effusion with associated
atelectasis and a small left pleural effusion with left basilar
atelectasis. TTE [**9-14**] showed a dilated RV with mild global
systolic dysfunction and evidence of volume overload, normal
global and regional LV systolic function (LVEF 55-60%), and
severe functional TR and mild AR/MR. Respiratory status remained
stable with adequate room air oxygenation. Volume status was
managed with HD, as above.
.
#Thrombocytopenia - The patient did not have clinical signs or
symptoms of bleeding or thrombosis. Attributed to an effect of
cephalosporin therapy but other
