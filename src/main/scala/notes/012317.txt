HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 66-year-old
female transferred from [**Hospital3 **] [**Location (un) 620**] for question of
lymphoma.  The patient recently presented to the [**Last Name (un) 4068**] on
[**2149-6-24**], with a history of weakness, 50-pound weight loss
over the past 3 months, and mouth sores.  Her mouth sores
were not responding to topical nystatin or p.o. Diflucan.  At
the [**Last Name (un) 4068**], she was found to have an urinary tract infection,
hyponatremia to 127, an elevated alkaline phosphatase of 238,
leukocytosis with an overall lymphopenia (white blood cell
count 13.7, with a differential of 75 polys, 15 bands, 3
lymphocytes).  A CAT scan of her thorax was performed at the
outside hospital on [**2149-6-25**], showing bilateral axillary
nodes as well as mediastinal, hilar, and pretracheal nodes
that were enlarged.  She also had enlarged inguinal nodes
that were biopsied and preliminary pathology reports showed
distorted architecture with eosonophilic predominance.
During that hospitalization at the [**Last Name (un) 4068**], she also had a
rash that was biopsied and that was consistent with a
lichenoid keratosis or lichen planus.

While at the [**Last Name (un) 4068**], she received a course of antibiotics,
including levofloxacin for UTI and a course of Augmentin for
a question of pneumonia by CT.  She also received a short
taper of prednisone from [**2149-7-4**] to [**2149-7-10**] for the
possibility of pemphigus as a cause of her oral lesions.  She
received a short course of acyclovir for a small lesion on
her left lower eyelid, which was potentially herpetic.  She
had negative HIV test and negative [**Doctor First Name **] at the outside
hospital.  She had intermittent fevers while an inpatient and
continued to complain of mouth pain, chronically poor vision,
and a generalized rash.  She also complained of increasing
diarrhea.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient has no history of tobacco use or

in the area.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On initial presentation, the patient's
vital signs were as follows; temperature of 98.6, blood
pressure of 128/51, heart rate of 76, respiratory rate of 18,
saturation of 94 on room air.  She was a woman in her mid 60s
in no apparent distress.  She had bilateral surgical pupils
that were equally reactive and had full extraocular motions.
She had no cervical lymphadenopathy, but large nontender
axillary nodes were noted on exam.  She had a regular rate
with normal S1 and S2.  There were no murmurs, rubs, or
gallops.  She had bibasilar rales noted.  Her abdomen was
nontender.  There were two well-healed old surgical scars,
one in the right upper quadrant from old a cholecystectomy
and one below the umbilicus in the midline from her TAH.  She
had no hepatosplenomegaly noted on exam.  She had no
extremity clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.  Her skin exam was
notable for a diffuse macular rash on the legs and arms with
signs of excoriation.  She was alert and oriented times 3.
Cranial nerves were intact.  She had a normal strength and 1
plus symmetric DTRs.

LABORATORY DATA:  Her initial CBC showed a white count of
11.1, hematocrit of 32.6, platelet count of 375.  Her
chemistry showed a sodium of 128, potassium of 5.1, chloride
of 93, CO2 of 26, BUN of 13, creatinine of 0.7, and glucose
of 225.  Her LFTs were as follows; ALT of 37, AST of 27,
total bilirubin of 0.3, alkaline phosphatase of 199, LDH of
183, albumin of 2.2.  HIV and [**Doctor First Name **] tests were negative per the
outside hospital.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  This 66-year-old female with history of
mouth ulcerations, diffuse skin rash, lymphadenopathy,
diarrhea, lymphopenia, hyponatremia, and anemia, was
transferred in from the [**Hospital3 **] [**Location (un) 620**] for workup of
symptoms of unclear etiology.

Multiple consult services were involved in order to determine
the etiology of this lady's symptoms.  Dermatology was
consulted on [**2149-7-11**] in order to investigate her rash and
oral ulcerations.  They noted a diffuse maculopapular rash
with a wide differential noted on their note.  They requested
several additional labs including HCV antibodies and
performed a DFA of one of the lesions from the inside of her
mouth.  They followed upon the biopsy results from the
outside hospital of the rash, which was most consistent with
lichen planus.  They recommended Aquaphor to her lips for
symptomatic treatment.

The gastrointestinal service was consulted on [**2149-7-12**], due
to her diarrhea and oral ulcerations.  The GI service wound
up performing both the colonoscopy as well as an EGD on this
patient.  The colonoscopy was performed on Tuesday, [**2149-7-15**],
for the history of diarrhea and weight loss.  They found
multiple non-bleeding aphthous ulcers ranging from 5 to 10 mm
seen throughout the entire colon as well as terminal ileum.
The differential at that time for the ulceration included
Crohn's disease as well as Behcet disease or some form of
vasculitis.  Biopsies were performed at multiple sites.  The
EGD was also performed on [**2149-7-15**].  They found diffuse
erythema and friability of the mucosa with no bleeding in the
stomach, body, and antrum.  Findings were compatible with
gastritis.  Biopsies were also performed here.  The duodenum
was noted to be normal.

Surgery was also consulted on [**2149-7-12**] to determine if there
is a surgical cause for her symptom.  They recommended adding
some additional studies to follow up on the elevated alkaline
phosphatase.  Optimizing nutrition, and offered to repeat
open biopsy despite the fact that it has had been done
previously at the outside hospital.  She initially had been
admitted to the BMT service because of the question of
lymphoma, but was transferred over to the Acove Service on
[**2149-7-15**].

The patient was started on tube feeds and was given TPN
supplementation in order to optimize her nutritional status.

The pulmonary service was consulted on [**2149-7-16**], given the
diffuse pulmonary infiltrates that were seen as well as the
chest CT patchy infiltrates and lymphadenopathy, they
recommended adding some additional rheumatological
investigations such as pANCA, cANCA, sedimentation rate, and
requested a high-resolution chest CT to better evaluate the
lung changes.  Differential for her pulmonary complaints
included eosinophilic pneumonitis versus some form of
vasculitis.  MRSA had been noted on the sputum [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **]
she was started on vancomycin.

The ophthalmology service was consulted on [**2149-7-17**] because
of her complaints of gradually decreasing vision bilaterally
over the past month.  She had a past eye history significant
for bilateral cataract surgeries as well as panretinal
photocoagulation for diabetic retinopathy done by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **].
She also has a history of iritis of unclear etiology in the
past.  The ophthalmology service recommended intensive course
of topical lubrication as well as erythromycin ointment.
They also recommended that they continue the Travatan drops
that she has been receiving while in the hospital.  Thus it
was obvious from the above dictation, multiple services were
involved with this patient in order to determine the cause of
her diffuse multisystem disease.  The overall clinical
picture was puzzling.  The small bowel-follow-through
initially requested by GI had been performed which showed a
stricture in the terminal ileum that the radiologist felt
could be consistent with Crohn 's disease.  However, the
biop
