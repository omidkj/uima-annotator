History of Present Illness:
71 y/o woman who has not seen a physician for about 20 presented
to the with several weeks of malaise, fatigue, and then today
developed a headache with new-onset confusion and a high blood

recent dysuria; no h/o UTIs in the past.
.
In the ED, initial VS were:
T 98.4 HR 119 BP 200/116 O2 Sat 97% RA
EKG was notable for diffuse deep TWI most prominent in the
lateral leads. Trop 0.17, CKMB 14. Cardiology was consulted and
felt given the diffuse nature of the EKG changes, they were most
liklely toxic/metabolic in the setting of DKA and did not
represent an acute plaque rupture. Bedside TTE showed Takotsubo
pattern, though this was not a formal study. She was started on
Heparin gtt and received full dose ASA and Nitro for HTN. She
was noted to be altered, CT head showed no acute process. Labs
were notable for BG >600, Lactate 4, HCO3 20, AG 24, WBC 12.3.
UA showed small leuks/blood and glucose 1000, for which she
received Ceftriaxone 1g IV x1.

Imaging Results:
 ECG Study Date of [**2135-2-13**]  8:25:24 PM

Sinus tachycardia. Diffuse T wave inversions throughout the limb
leads
and precordium. Q-T interval prolongation. Possible anterior
wall myocardial infarction. Deep symmterical diffuse T wave
inversions raise the possibility of cardiomyopathy. Clinical
correlation is suggested. No previous tracing available for
comparison.

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2135-2-13**] 7:40 PM
IMPRESSION: No evidence of acute process.

CHEST (PA & LAT) Study Date of [**2135-2-13**] 7:57 PM
IMPRESSION: Right hemidiaphragm elevation with opacification
posteriorly
suggesting extensive adjacent lung atelectasis, though cannot
exclude
developing infectious process. Possible right pleural effusion
as well. If
