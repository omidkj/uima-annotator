NOTE:  This is a final addendum to discharge addendum
dictated on [**7-6**].

The patient's discharge was deferred, waiting for appropriate
bed placement.  He underwent, on [**7-17**], a right BKA secondary
to progressive ischemic and non healing changes in the right
hallux amputation.  The patient had an episode of mental
status changes with arterial blood gases 7.31, 50, 118, 26,
-3 at 3 liters.  The patient did show significant improvement
over the next 24 hours.  His hematocrit was stable at 28.9
and his CT was negative for acute infarct or bleed.  He was
transferred out of VICU on [**7-18**].  Psychiatry was requested to
see the patient on [**7-19**] because of expression of wishes to
dye and commit suicide.

Impression was that the patient did not endorse or show any
signs or symptoms of depression currently.  He was clinically
adjusted to his amputation site with mild depressed mood.
The patient was in good spirits and looking forward to
rehabilitation.  Recommendations were to check B12, folate
and TSH and Free T4 and urinalysis levels.  This was
........... hypothyroid with a TSH of 81 and a T4 of 0.3.
Synthroid begun.  Recommendations from medical service was to
begin Synthroid at 25 mcg q a.m. for one week.  If the
patient tolerates this, then adjust dosing to 50 mcg once a
week at 75 mcg q a.m.  The patient had an episode of
melanotic stool with a drop in hematocrit over several days
from 29.9 to 25.6.  His heparin was held, ........ was held.

Gastrointestinal was consulted to see the patient.  It was
noted that he had undergone an esophagogastroduodenoscopy in
[**Month (only) 956**] of this year which showed gastritis.  Biopsy showed
chronic inflammation.  He also underwent a colonoscopy with
grade 2 internal hemorrhoids, multiple non bleeding
diverticula.  He also had a small bowel follow through study
which was normal and felt that gastrointestinal bleeding was
secondary to internal hemorrhoids and that conservative
treatment was indicated and no further endoscopic procedures
were needed at this time.  Recommendations were to add
lactulose for constipation and continue stool softeners.

The patient was transfused at dialysis with stabilization of
his hematocrit.  The patient had recurrent episodes of
suicidal ideation and psychiatry was asked to reevaluate the
patient.  He was began on Zoloft.  He was continued on his
Levoxyl and he had a 1 to 1 sitter for at least 48 to 72
hours.  The patient mood since then has improved.  The
patient's mood does continue to improve and he was discharged
to rehabilitation in agreement with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 1313**],
his primary care physician, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] psychiatry.  He no longer had
any suicidal ideation.

Wound at the time of discharge showed some purple
discoloration on the anterior flap.  The skin wound edges
were intact.  There was no ischemic changes noted.  The
patient should continue on his antibiotics for a total of one
month post his right BKA which was done on [**7-18**].  He should
follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in one month's time.  All skin
