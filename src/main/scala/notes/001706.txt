Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2195**]
Chief Complaint:
SOB, Syncope

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
55 year old male with a PMH of STEMI s/p stent '[**79**] who stopped
his plavix 2 months ago [**2-10**] financial issues, who presents from
[**Hospital3 2737**] with near syncope and SOB.
.
The patient states he was doing yardwork, started walking across
the lawn, felt dizzy and lightheaded for 1 minute and felt like
he was going to pass out. The patient states that this was
nothing like his prior MI.  He sat down on his steps where he
"blacked out" for less than 30 seconds and he immediately came
to.  FSBG was 168 at that time.  His wife called the ambulance
and the patient presented to [**Hospital1 **] where he was worked up for
MI, initial troponin I was .29 and repeat was .6.  He was
transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] with concern for ACS on heparin drip.

.

Per patient there has been no recent travel, no smoking, no
prolonged immobilization, though he has been less active at
work.

.

In the ED initial vital signs were 98.5 75 147/86 18 98% 2L NC.
Heparin drip was continued at 1000 unites per hour.  CTA
revealed saddle PE, and dopplers revealed a non-obstructive
popliteal clot.  No labs were checked and the patient was
admitted directly to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].  Vitals at the time of transfer
were 97.8, 70, 151/91, 23, 100 2L

Imaging:
[**10-10**] CTA chest:
1. Saddle pulmonary embolus with early evidence of right
ventricular heart
strain. Thrombus burden is very high.
2. Hypoattenuating focus in the left ventricular apex in an area
surrounded
by fibrofatty replaced myocardium is concerning for a left
ventricular apical
thrombus in an area of prior infarct. Further evaluation with
echocardiography is recommended.

[**10-10**] LENI:
Non-occlusive left popliteal vein DVT.

[**10-11**] echo:
Mild focal LV systolic dysfunction consistent with prior mid-LAD
infarction. Early appearance of agitated saline seen in the left
atrium and left ventricle, consistent with a small ASD or PFO.
The right ventricle is probably mildly dilated with borderline
systolic function.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2183-7-19**],
agitated saline was used in the current study and suggests a
small ASD or PFO. The aorta is slightly dilated on the current
study.The right ventricle is mildly dilated/hypokinetic on the
current study. The other findings are similar

Brief Hospital Course:
55M presenting with syncope, found to have saddle PE on CTA with
troponin leak.

#Saddle PE, acute: On admission pt was started on weight based
heparin ggt, which was then overlapped with coumadin starting
[**10-11**] with a goal INR [**2-11**].  Patient has remained HD stable
throughout admission, although bradycardic at times, with
excellent oxygenation, no chest pain & no SOB. LENIs show
non-occlusive popliteal vein DVT.  TTE suggests small ASD or
PFO, likely visible now given increased right-sided pressures in
the setting of PE.  This will need to be adressed in the future
re: potential closing.  He will also need age-appropriate cancer
screening in the outpatient setting. an outpt hypercoaguable
workup.
- He will be discharged on Coumadin 5mg, which is the dose he
has been consistently receiving in the hospital. The
[**Hospital3 **] will be in contact with him tomorrow
morning, and will arrange follow-up INR checks. A prescription
for outpatient lab work was given at the time of discharge.
- Of note, CTA, initial echo suggested LV Thrombus. [**10-11**] TTE
shows stable EF at 40-45% (EF at 40-45% in [**July 2183**]). A left
ventricular mass/thrombus cannot be excluded.  Cardiology was
consulted who recommed contrast echo for further eval.  This did
NOT show any LV thrombus

#Troponin Leak:  Most likely right heart strain in the setting
of the PE.  Peak trop 0.09 -> 0.05 this AM. EKG unconcerning.

#HTN: Given potential for cardiogenic shock, antihypertensives
were initially held. They were slowly re-introduced with stable
blood pressures. His home medication regimen was resumed prior
to discharge with the exception of Toprol, which was decreased
to 25mg given bradycardia during his hospital stay.

#DM2: Placed on reduced dose 70/30 with HISS coverage.  Resumed
to usual dose at discharge.
