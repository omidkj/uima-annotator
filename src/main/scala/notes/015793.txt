Chief Complaint:
Massive pulmonary embolism

n/a

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a [**Age over 90 **] year old Spanish-speaking man with a history of
past MIs in [**2138**] and [**2142**], reported CHF, afib on coumadin until
2 months ago, defibrillator/?pacer for 10 years, who presents
from an outside hospital with a massive pulmonary embolism. He
apparently was approximately in his usual state of health and
eating dinner with his family after which he went to the
bathroom. A relative noted that he had not come out and went to
check on him, and found him blue and unresponsive. 911 was
called. They took about 10-15 minutes to arrive per his family,
and per an EMS runsheet, arrived at 1750 on [**7-28**], and per the
run sheet, departed for the hospital at 1802, arriving 1824. The
run sheet notes that he was unresponsive and placed on a NRB at
15L. By report, although timing it is not clear from the
paperwork, he was intubated during transport; by verbal report
of family but not of OSH or EMS paperwork, compressions were
performed. Of note, the patient has a defibrillator per his
MedicAlert bracelet.
.
When he arrived to the [**Hospital6 3105**], he was taken
for an emergency CT scan with contrast, which revealed a clot
occluding the right main pulmonary artery and branches. They
also noted upgoing toes and rigid tone; he received 2 mg of
lorazepam for muscle rigidity. Based on this, he was transferred
to the [**Hospital1 18**] for further management. It does not seem that
heparin was started at that time.
.
On arrival in the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, Heparin was started at the [**Hospital1 18**],
where a radiology read of the LGH CT scan revealed an RV/LV
ratio >2 and IV contrast in the IVC, each suggesting RV strain.
He received another 2 mg of lorazepam. Heparin was started, with
a bolus of 5400 units, and a drip of 1200 units/hr. IV access
was established with two 20g and an 18 g; a groin stick was done
for labs in the ED.
.
At time of arrival in the ED at 2115, he had vitals of 98.8, HR
99, BP 134/83, RR 13, O2 100% with vent settings not recorded in
the ED run sheet. 200 cc of urine output was recorded in his
Foley over the two hours he was in the ED. He apparently
received one liter of fluid plus additional fluid.
.
The MICU resident briefly evaluated the patient in the ED where
a brief exam was notable for unresponsiveness, warm feet, and
mild response to withdrawal. Further evaluation once he arrived
in the MICU is detailed below. A family meeting in Spanish and
English was held with many members of his family; members of his
family translated and one of the MICU team obtained history in
both Spanish and English. An ICU consent was obtained. The NEOB
was notified per protocol and refused based on age.


Past Medical History:
Per family and MedicAlert summary:
- implanted defibrillator (seen on CXR)
- past MIs [**2138**], [**2142**]
- had been on coumadin for unclear indication, family said he
had been on it for a long time but stopped a couple months ago
(?for supratx INR per one ED note)
- CHF


Social History:
Was a farmer in the [**Country 13622**] Republic. Tobacco 40 years, now
quit. No EtOH, no drugs.

Family History:
Likely only lightly contributory in this [**Age over 90 **] year old man, but
significant for MI in his brother, CVA in a sister, and prostate
cancer in a brother.

[**7-28**] CTA FINDINGS: The heart is mildly enlarged. There is
atherosclerotic disease of the aorta, which is tortuous. There
is extensive thrombus within all lobar and most segmental
branches of the right pulmonary artery. Also noted is a small
filling defect compatible with thrombus within the left main
pulmonary artery at the origin of the left upper lobe pulmonary
artery. There is reflux of contrast into the IVC. There is no
enlargement of the main pulmonary artery. No pericardial
effusions are identified. There is no mediastinal or hilar
lymphadenopathy. A single-lead pacemaker is noted with the lead
terminating in the right ventricle. An endotracheal tube
terminates at the carina.
Emphysematous changes are noted throughout both lungs with
scarring at the
lung apices. Motion limits evaluation for small nodules. There
are no
pleural effusions or pneumothorax.
Images of the upper abdomen demonstrate multiple low-density
lesions within the kidneys bilaterally, which are too small to
characterize but likely consistent with cysts. There is a coarse
calcification within the liver likely representing a granuloma.
There is tortuosity of the aorta. No acute osseous abnormalities
are detected. Multilevel degenerative changes are noted
throughout the spine.
IMPRESSION:
1. Extensive right sided pulmonary embolus involving all lobar
and most
segmental branches. Small filling defect in the left main
pulmonary artery at the origin of the left upper lobe pulmonary
artery. strain.
2. Emphysema with scarring at the apices.
3. Multiple low-density lesions in the kidneys which are too
small to
characterize but likely represent cysts.
4. Endotracheal tube terminating at the carina. Subsequent chest
x-ray
demonstrates appropriate positioning of the endotracheal tube.

[**7-29**] Echo: The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity
size. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global
systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal
technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be
fully excluded. The estimated cardiac index is normal
(>=2.5L/min/m2). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. [Intrinsic right ventricular systolic
function is likely more depressed given the severity of
tricuspid regurgitation.] There is abnormal systolic septal
motion/position consistent with right ventricular pressure
overload. The diameters of aorta at the sinus and ascending are
normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but
aortic stenosis is not present. Trace aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial
mitral regurgitation. Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid
regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is an anterior space which most
likely represents a fat pad.
IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Normal biventricular
cavity sizes with preserved global biventricular systolic
function. Moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation. Pulmonary
artery hypertension.
