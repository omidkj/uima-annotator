ECG: Sinus rhythm with demand ventricular pacing
Ventricular premature complexes
Since previous tracing of the same date, QRS width shorter,
assess LV pacing

CXR: FINDINGS: The pacer/defibrillator leads are again seen
terminating in the right ventricle and coronary sinus. There are
median sternotomy wires. An additional disconnected pacer wire
is seen within the left chest wall, as on prior. There is no
evidence of pneumonia. There is cardiomegaly, without CHF. There
is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion. Degenerative changes are
seen at the right humeral head. The bones are otherwise
unremarkable.
IMPRESSION: No acute intrathoracic process. Cardiomegaly without
CHF.

ECHO: The left atrium is dilated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity is severely
dilated. There is severe regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction with akinesis of all inferior and inferolateral
segments and of the basal lateral segments. The other segments
are severely hypokinetic. There is no ventricular septal defect.
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with mild global
free wall hypokinesis. The aortic root is moderately dilated at
the sinus level. The aortic valve leaflets are severely
thickened/deformed. There is moderate to severe aortic valve
stenosis (area 0.8-1.0cm2). No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral
valve prolapse. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is
no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Severe focal and global LV systolic dysfunction.
Moderate to severe aortic stenosis. Moderate mitral
regurgitation.

Abdominal XR: FOUR VIEWS OF THE ABDOMEN: There are moderately
dilated loops of small bowel, and multiple air-fluid levels are
demonstrated on the left lateral decubitus. There is no evidence
of free air. Cholecystectomy clips in the right upper quadrant
and the right hip arthroplasty are again identified. There is
air within the rectum. The left hip demonstrates moderate
degenerative change. Midline sternotomy wires and a pacing
device are identified.
IMPRESSION: Moderately dilated loops of small bowel and
air-fluid levels are consistent with ileus or early/partial
small-bowel obstruction.


Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the MICU for monitoring and serial
Hcts.  His BP reamined in the 90-110 systolic range. A Hct drop
from 39 to 32 was noted, which then stabilized. GI saw the
patient, no plan for emergent scope. Cardiology saw the pt and
recommended an echocardiogram. Cardiac enzymes were cycled; the
first two sets were negative, the third troponin was 0.02 (has
been similar in the past), in the setting of constant chest pain
x 24 hours. Diuretics and anti-hypertensives were held.
.

A/P: 72 yo M with MMP including CAD, CHF, CRI admit with GIB,
abdominal pain, and chest pain, now callout from MICU.
.
# GI bleed/Abd pain: Hx GI bleeding in the past, recent EGD by
GI showed erosions in stomach and duodenum c/w NSAID
gastropathy, had a normal [**Last Name (un) **] in [**Month (only) 547**]. Hct stable and has not
required transfusion. No evidence of active bleed. LFTs normal
on admit. Mesenteric ischemia was considered as patient
stabalized this was not pursed.  He had some persistent nausea
which improved with reglan.  He was discharged in omeprazole.

# Chest pain: with extensive CAD and
