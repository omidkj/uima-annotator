Allergies:
Morphine

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 492**]
Chief Complaint:
Respiratory Failure (OSH Transfer)

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation

History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 67 yo F who originally presented to the OSH on
[**2185-1-15**] with 3-5 days of gradually worsening shortness of
breath, with intermittent pain across her anterior chest.
Denied cough, sputum, fevers, or chills at that time.  Per
family report actually had several months of mild SOB leading up
to this presentation.  At the time of presentation CXR was
significant for bilateral pulmonary infiltrates and she was
admitted with presumed CHF.  Initial BNP was 936.  An ECHO
showed EF 60% with mild diastolic dysfunction.  She was diuresed
without improvement in her symptoms.

A CTA was performed on [**2186-1-16**] which showed diffuse,
bilaterally ground glass opacities and subsequent scans showed
this to be progressing.  She was started on empiric high dose
steroids (solumedrol 125mg q6hrs).  She improved slightly but
then again worsened.  On [**2185-1-22**] a bronchscopy was performed
(unclear results).  Later that day, the patient required
intubation.  Since then her ventilator requirements increased.
On [**2185-1-24**] she was taken to the OR for an open lung biopsy but
desat'd prior to the procedure.  The procedure was canceled.

Thus far, the workup has been negative.  This has included a
normal [**Last Name (LF) 8213**], [**First Name3 (LF) **], and RF.  ANCA and GBM are pending.  Blood and
sputum cultures have been negative (including AFB smears, fungal
cultures, HSV, RSV, influenza A/B).  Urine legionella is
negative.  CMV and AFB cultures are still pending.

Of note, the patient developed thrombocytopenia (HIT negative).
Also her sugars became markedly elevated after initiating
steroids and an insulin drip was initiated.

At the time of transfer she was on pressure control ventilation
FiO260%, PC 25, RR20, PEEP12.5.  Most recent gas was 7.44/66/60.

Social History:
Lives in a senior living community.  Spends 80% of her time in
her apartment.  Quit smoking >10years ago. 15 years ago was a
heavy drinker.


Family History:
Mother died of "lung scaring"

Physical Exam:
Vitals - HR 64, BP 604/52, O2 97%
General - intubated and sedated
HEENT - PERRL
Neck - right SC in place
CV - RRR, no murmur appreciated
Lungs - + crepitus over anterior chest, lungs with scattered
rhonchi
Abdomen - soft, NT/ND
Ext - chronic venous stasis changes


Pertinent Results:
CT Chest [**2185-1-28**] -
1. Significant subcutaneous gas collection of the anterior chest
wall and neck with minimal pneumomediastinum. However, no
pneumothorax or pneumopericardium are seen.
2. Diffuse ground-glass opacity with septal thickening and
dependent atelectasis and/or consolidation, which is in favor of
ARDS and less likely a cardiogenic cause since there is no
pleural effusion.

ECHO [**2185-1-29**] -
The left atrium is normal in size. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and systolic
function (LVEF>65%). Due to suboptimal technical quality, a
focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good
leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve
appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse. The pulmonary artery systolic
pressure could not be quantified. There is no pericardial
effusion. IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with preserved global biventricular systolic
function.


Brief Hospital Course:
67 yo F with bipolar and cirrhosis, transferred from OSH with
worsening ARDS

Respiratory Failure - The patient was admitted from the OSH
intubated with bilateral pulm infiltrates that had rapidly
progressived over the last few weeks.  Her clinical picture was
consistent with ARDS.  She also had a significant amount of
subcutaneous air on exam (and seen on X-ray) and it was
worsening on AC mode of the ventilator.  She was switched to
pressure control.  She remained unresponsive to the high dose
steroids and we began to taper then off.  Over the next 48-72
hours her oxygenation improved and we were able to switch her
over to pressure support ventilation. A tracheostomy and PEG
tube were placed on [**2-3**]. However, on [**2-5**] her clinical picture
worsened and she became more uncomfortable on the vent.
Bronchoscopy revealed purulent secretions and antibiotics were
broadened to vanco/cefepime. She continued to worsen and became
increasingly difficult to ventilate. A trial of APRV was
initiated on [**2-6**] and antibiotics were changed to
meropenem/ciprofloxacin/flagyl/vancomycin. PEEP was increased
until limited by hypotension and high plateau pressures. A
family meeting was held on [**2-8**] and the goals of care were
transitioned to comfort. The ventilator was removed on [**2-8**] and
she expired at 12:03am on [**2-9**].

Diabetes - The was placed on insulin.  Her elevated blood sugars
were thought secondary to the steroids.

Cirrhosis - per family, thought [**2-19**] ETOH.  LFTs/INR WNL at OSH.

Bipolar - The patient was continued on her home dose of
depakote.

Hypothyroid - The patient was continued on her home
levothyroxine dose.
