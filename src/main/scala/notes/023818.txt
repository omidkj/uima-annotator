Pertinent Results:
[**1-10**] Carotid U/S and Vein mapping: Right ICA no stenosis. Left
ICA stenosis <40%. Duplex and color Doppler demonstrate patent
bilateral lesser and greater saphenous veins, please see
digitized images on PACS for formal sequential measurements.
There are varicosities noted involving the left calf and the
right lesser saphenous vein is somewhat diminutive in diameter.
[**2103-1-11**] Echo: PRE-CPB: 1. The left atrium is moderately
dilated. No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the
body of the left atrium or left atrial appendage. The left
atrial appendage emptying velocity is depressed (<0.2m/s). A
left atrial appendage thrombus cannot be excluded. 2. No atrial
septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. 3. Left
ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular
cavity is moderately dilated. The remaining left ventricular
segments are hypokinetic. LVEF = 30%. 4. The right ventricular
cavity is moderately dilated with moderate global free wall
hypokinesis. There is abnormal septal motion/position. 5. There
are simple atheroma in the aortic arch. There are simple
atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. 6. There are three
aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis. Trace aortic
regurgitation is seen. 7. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is
seen with a central jet. The vena contracta is consistent with
moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation. There is bilateral leaflet
restriction. The leaflets appear structurally normal. There is
dilation of the annulus in the commisural plane.. The left
ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
was notified in person of the results. POST-CPB: On infusions of
norepinephrine, milrinone. AV pacing for slow SR with first
degree AVB. Well-seated annuloplasty ring in the mitral
position. Trace MR. [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 16631**] function is improved
on inotropic support. LVEF is now 35%. Aortic contour is normal

Final Report
PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST

REASON FOR EXAM: Status post CABG and MVR repair.

Comparison is made with prior study [**2103-1-14**].

Small right pneumothorax is stable. Mild cardiomegaly is
unchanged.
Postoperative mediastinal widening is stable. Right lower lobe
atelectasis
has improved. Aeration in the left lower lobe has also improved.
Sternal
wires are aligned. There is atelectasis adjacent to the right
minor fissure.
There are no enlarging pleural effusions. There is mild fluid
overload.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was transferred from MWMC after cardiac cath revealed
severe three vessel disease and moderate mitral regurgitation.
Upon admission he was completely worked-up for surgical
intervention. On [**1-11**] he was brought to the operating room
where he underwent a coronary artery bypass, mitral valve repair
and MAZE procedure. Please see operative report for surgical
details. Following surgery he was transferred to the CVICU for
invasive monitoring in stable condition.  POD 1 found the
patient extubated, alert and oriented and breathing comfortably.
 He was neurologically intact and hemodynamics were maintained
with milrinone and levophed which were weaned subsequently.
Coumadin was started for atrial flutter, as well as evidence of
a right atrial clot that was seen in the operating room.  Chest
tubes and pacing wires were discontinued without complication.
The patient was transferred to the telemetry floor on POD 4.  He
made further progress with physical therapy, demonstrating good
strength and balance prior to discharge.  The patient remained
in atrial flutter throughout the hospital course.  His rate was
controlled with beta blockers.  Anticoagulation was achieved
with a heparin bridge to coumadin.  By the time of discharge on
POD 7, the patient was ambulating freely, the wound was healing
and pain was controlled with oral analgesics.  He was discharged
home in good condition with VNA services.  His anticoagulation
will be followed by the MWMC coumadin clinic.  His first INR
will be drawn by the VNA on Sat. [**1-20**] and will be called into
the MW heart center attending on call.  A list of inpatient INRs
and coumadin doses has been faxed to the MW heart center
[**Hospital 2282**] clinic and will be sent home with the patient for the
VNA.  This plan was discussed with [**Doctor First Name **] from the
