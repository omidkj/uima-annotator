Brief Hospital Course:
On [**2117-10-1**], she underwent repair of incisional hernia with mesh
and a liver biopsy. Surgeon was Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) **]. A #10 JP was
placed in the right abdomen. Postop, she received PCA morphine
with minimal pain. Diet was advanced and tolerated. Morphine was
switched to percocet, but provided only partial relief of pain.
Morphine was used for breakthru pain. The JP had serosanguinous
drainage that decreased in output to 20cc. This was removed on
pod 3. The incision was clean, dry and intact. The foley was
removed and she was able to void. Coumadin was resumed at 4mg.
INR was 2.8 on pod 3. LFTS and other labs were stable. Vital
signs were stable and she was afebrile. She was ambulating
independently.

Of note, rapamune was converted to prograf to prevent impaired
wound healing. A trough prograf level will be done on [**10-6**] along
with cbc, chem 10, lfts and INR. The liver biospy was not
finalized at time of discharge.
