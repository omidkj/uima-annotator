Brief Hospital Course:
Pt was admitted to the neurosurgery service and [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 8745**] bolt to
monitor ICPs was placed in the ED.  Initial ICP was 10 and this
remained in normal range.  She was admitted to ICU were she was
followed closely with neurologic exams.  repeat CT showed stable
hemorrhage. The [**Last Name (un) 8745**] bolt was removed [**9-3**].She began spiking
temperatures - fever work up including CSF cxs, LENI's and
abdominal ultrasound revealed no source.  She was changed from
dilantin to keppra for seizure prophylaxis.  She was treated for
ventilator acquired pneumonia.  She was attempted pn multiple
occasions to wean from the ventilator and ultimately underwent
trach and PEG on [**2103-9-11**].  She still was difficult to wean from
vent.  She continued to spike fevers and only pneumonia was
found as source. She had cervical collar on but had negative
cervical CT and this was cleared.  She did require transfusions
for decreasing hematocrit.  She had large hematoma on occipital
scalp which was treated with wet to dry dressings and her head
was kept on a donut to remove pressure from the hematoma. Her
neuro exam slowly improved and she did open eyes and follow some
commands, although this was inconsistent. The patient was
tolerating a trach mask for several hours a day prior to
discharge but did require the ventilator for most of the time,
especially during the night.
