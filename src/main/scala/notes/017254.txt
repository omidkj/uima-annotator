Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2009**]
Chief Complaint:
Severe alcohol withdrawal


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 9804**] is a 55 year old male with a history of alcohol
abuse who presents from [**Hospital1 **] on section 21 with concern
for severe alcohol withdrawal.  Per report, Mr. [**Known lastname 9804**] went to
an OSH ED and was then transferred to Bornewood.  Today he was
noted to be tachycardic, hypertensive, diaphoretic, and shaky
and sent to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED due to concern that he would require IV
benzodiazepines and was at high risk for DTs.  Per report he was
receiving ativan "regularly" at [**Hospital1 **].
.
In the ED, initial vs were: Pain 0, T 98.1, HR 125, BP 138/96,
RR 24, 100% RA.  Patient was noted to be tachycardic,
diaphoretic, and tremulous.  He was given 1.2L NS, compazine 10
mg IV, zofran 4mg IV, benadryl 25 mg IV, valium 10 mg IV x 6,
and valium 10 mg PO x 1.  They tried to transition him to PO
valium and he began to dry heave.
.
On arrival to the ICU the patient appeared drowsy but was easily
arousable.  He was complaining of nausea and abdominal
discomfort and stated that he vomited several times at
[**Hospital1 **] earlier today.  He denies any past seizures related
to alcohol withdrawal.  He stated his last drink was yesterday
afternoon and he had "8-14 beers" which is typical for him.
.

Chest CT [**3-11**]:
INDICATION: Progressive hypoxia, shortness of breath, evaluate
for PE.

COMPARISON: None.

TECHNIQUE: Helical CT acquisitions top of the lung to upper
abdomen with and without intravenous contrast. Multiplanar
reformations were generated.  Oblique maximum intensity
projection images were also generated.

CT OF THE CHEST WITH AND WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:
Non-contrast images
demonstrate no evidence of intramural hematoma or mediastinal
hemorrhage.
Coronary artery calcifications are present. There is mild
atherosclerotic
calcification at the origin of the left innominate.

Contrast-enhanced sequences demonstrate normal opacification of
the central, segmental, large subsegmental pulmonary vessels
without pulmonary embolism.  Distal subsegmental pulmonary
vessels are suboptimally opacified limiting evaluation. Aortic
contour is well defined without evidence of aneurysm or
dissection.

Bilateral dependent atelectasis is present, right greater than
left.
Otherwise lungs are clear. Distal tracheal dependent low
attenuation
opacities are likely secretions, if further evaluation is
desired post-cough CT trachea target towards the carinal anatomy
may be considered. Mild cylindrical bronchiectasis predominantly
in the right lower lobe is present.  No active peribronchial
inflammation or infectious findings are associated.


There are multiple right-sided hilar and paramedial mediastinal
lymph node
measuring up to 1.2 cm in short axis. Similarly, there is an
enlarged right upper paratracheal lymph node measuring up to 1.2
cm in short axis.

There is marked kyphotic deformity of the thoracic spine with
multiple wedge compression fractures, new since the prior study
obtained in [**2175**]. These were suboptimally evaluated on the
recent AP radiographs. There is posterior spinal fusion hardware
with bilateral pedicle screws and post-kyphoplasty changes at
T12 vertebral body. At T11 the pedicle screws are on the right
is above the superior endplate and in close proximity to the
superior endplate on the left.

Limited non-diagnostic evaluation of the imaged upper abdomen
demonstrates
interposition of the colon and nonspecific thickening of the
right adrenal
gland without discrete nodules. There is a small hiatal hernia.

IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
2. Coronary artery disease.
3. Non-specific borderline right mediatinal and hilar
lymphadenopathy, of
uncertain clinical signfiicance as an incidental finding.
Consider a follow up CT in 6 months, if warranted clinically.
4. Posterior spinal fusion with T11 right pedicle screw
protruding above the superior endplate.
6. Nonspecific right adrenal thickening.
7. Likely retained secretions in lower trachea. If warranted,
the
patient may return for limited images through this region
following coughing.


Brief Hospital Course:
55 year old male with history of alcohol abuse transfered for
severe alcohol withdrawal requiring IV benzodiazepines.
.
#. Alcohol withdrawal - Patient required large amount of IV
valium in the ED.  As he does not regularly get his care here,
it is unclear how much valium he typically requires.  His
withdrawal initially appeared to be better controlled with
valium 10 mg PO Q1H:prn, however, was requiring Q1H valium and
dosage needed to be increased to 20mg IV Q1H PRN for worsening
CIWA scores. As he remained HD stable and was not found to have
active severe withdrawal, his CIWA dosing scale was spaced out
to q2H PRN CIWA>10.  On [**2182-3-11**], the patient was found to be
medically stable and was called out to t
