subsequent complications including spinal ischemia with
paralysis, PE, bowel perf w/ graft infection &
bacteremia/fungemia (bacteriodes, strep pneumo and [**Female First Name (un) **]) s/p
left colectomy with colostomy, renal failure requiring dialysis,
complete heart block requiring pacemaker and a subsequent course
complicated by pnuemonia and respiratory failure and
tracheostomy who presents from nursing home with fatigue, found
to have Hct of 12 (baseline Hct of 32).  Pt notes increasing
weakness and decreased appetite x 3 days.  Pt denies
palpitation, lightheadedness, fevers, chills, n/v, abd pain or
bloody stool from ostomy.  He does note dark stool from his
ostomy but this is baseline.  Denies any NSAID use, but is on

   In the ED he was found to have guiac positive black stool in
his ostomy.  An NG lavage was negative and he was transfused one
unit of PRBC's in the emergency department.

IMAGING:
CT Abdomen/Pelvis [**4-17**]:
1. No evidence for aortoenteric fistula. High-density material
in the rectum may be due to bleeding, correlate with rectal
examination.
2. Stable appearance to abdominal aortic repair. Stable
appearance to
mesenteric vessels, and renal arteries, which remain patent.
3. Right gluteal hematoma without evidence for active arterial
extravasation into the hematoma.
4. Soft tissue mass in the proximal right femur, incompletely
evaluated.
Dedicated musculoskeletal imaging is recommended.
5. Stable ventral wall defect.

Bilateral LENI's [**4-18**]:
IMPRESSION: No deep venous thrombosis in either lower extremity

CT OF RIGHT FEMUR:
FINDINGS: The right gluteal hematoma is unchanged in size and
incompletely
evaluated on this examination.

In the subtrochanteric femur, there is a 1.6 x 1.8 x 4.2 cm
enhancing oval
lesion within the medullary canal. The adjacent posterior cortex
of the
posterior femur has a permeative appearance over a length of 10
cm. No other worrisome focal osseous lesions.

There is a sclerotic eccentric lobulated ossified lesion in the
distal medial femur in keeping with a healed non-ossified
fibroma. There is rarefaction of the trabeculae in the superior
acetabulum, likey related to osteopenia.

There are mild vascular calcifications throughout the thigh.
There is marked enthesopathy at the greater trochanter and
periarticular calcifications at the medial aspect of the
femoroacetabular joint near the femoral head-neck junction.
There is enthesopathy at the origins of the right hamstring
tendons. There are mild degenerative changes at the pubic
symphysis and mild-to-moderate degenerative changes at the hip.

A Foley catheter is in place. There are calcifications within
the prostate.

IMPRESSION: Intramedullary enhancing proximal femoral lesion
with associated permeative destruction of the posterior femoral
cortex is concerning for a neoplastic process. Metastatic
disease, plasmacytoma, or lymphoma would be most likely in this
age group.

PROCEDURES:

#EGD [**4-18**]:
Mild esophagitis
Foreign body in the stomach
Angioectasia in the second part of the duodenum
Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum

#[**2164-4-24**]:
CT GUIDED RIGHT PROXIMAL FEMUR BONE LESION BIOPSY

Indication: Diagnosis of right proximal femur bone lesion.

Procedure: CT-guided right femoral bone lesion biopsy.

Technique: The patient was informed of possible benefits, risks
and
alternatives. Written consent was obtained. A pre-procedural
timeout was
performed using at least 3 patient identifiers including name,
birthday, and medical record number. Site and side of the
procedure, as well as procedure to be performed were confirmed
by the patient.

A localizing CT scan was performed. An appropriate skin entry
site was
selected and the area prepped and draped in the usual sterile
fashion. Local anesthesia in the form of 1% lidocaine was
injected into the skin and subcutaneous soft tissues. A skin
[**Doctor Last Name **] with 11G blade was made. A 16 gauge Bonopty device was
advanced into the bone lesion and 3 bone cores were obtained
with the Bonopty device. Then a spring
