Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1936**]
Chief Complaint:
cough, chills

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**8-11**] Chest CTA
[**8-11**] Echocardiogram

History of Present Illness:
The patient is an 84M w/ DM2, afib, HTN who was transferred from
[**Hospital6 302**] per his request after presenting [**8-10**] with
persistent cough and fevers x2days. He noted shaking chills
after mowing his lawn 2days PTA and went to an urgent care
clinic where he was given IVF and Tylenol and sent home with a
diagnosis of gastroenteritis. He returned on [**8-9**] to the clinic
with persistent symptoms, CXR showed a left-sided PNA and he was
given Levaquin and sent home. He took one dose last night and
again this morning but still had symptoms, so he PCP told him to
go to a local ER. There, he was given a dose of Zosyn and
scheduled to be admitted but he requested transfer to [**Hospital1 18**] ED.
.
Here, CXR confirmed dense LML and LLL consolidations. He was
afebrile (although he had gotten Tylenol before being
transferred) and O2 sat was 89% on RA, improving to 95% on 4L.
BCx were drawn. Troponin was 0.02. He was admitted for further
management of his PNA.

Imaging/results:
.
.
CTA [**2146-8-11**];
IMPRESSION:
1. Negative examination for pulmonary embolism.
2. Left upper lobe and lingular dense pneumonia without
necrosis, associated with a small amount of pleural effusion.
3. Paraseptal and centrilobular emphysema.
4. Lung nodules, the largest measures 7 mm in left upper lobe.
WHile likely infectios, followup CT in four months is suggested
with a dedicated CT chest for further characterization.
5. Coronary artery calcifications.
6. Enlarged left atrium.
.
.

CXR [**2146-8-14**]: FINDINGS:
There is slightly diminished opacity to the airspace disease in
the superior portion of the left lower lobe infiltrate.
Otherwise, there is no significant interval change. No new
consolidations and no change in fluid status.
.
ECHO [**2146-8-11**]: The atria are markedly dilated. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size
and regional/global systolic function. Quantitative (triplane
3D) LVEF = 75%. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are moderately
thickened. There is mild aortic valve stenosis (area 1.5 cm2).
No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate [2+]
tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
preserved global and regional biventricular systolic function.
Mild mitral regurgitation. Moderate tricuspid regurgitation.
Moderate pulmonary hypertension.  .


Brief Hospital Course:
82 year old male with h/o HTN, Afib on coumadin, diastolic HF
(EF 75%), DM admitted [**8-10**] with fevers/cough and dx c CAP.
Intially placed on levaquin. [**Hospital 8351**] hospital course
complicated by worsening hypoxia requiring MICU transfer [**8-11**].
At this time, Abx broadened to Vanc/zosyn/azithro. also CTA done
which ruled out PE and redemonstrated extensive consolidation.
Trops negative and Echo no [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] 75%. Etiology of hypoxia
still CAP. Weaned from 10L O2 to 6L O2, afebrile, and sent to
floor [**8-15**] on Vanc/zosyn.  Did well on floor. kept on broad abx
since no sputum was able to be collected for cx (bronch too high
risk). Plan to treat with 10days of Abx. Sent to LTAC for
further care, Abx, monitoring of Hypoxia, f/u imaging.
.
.
Please see progress note below for details on hospital course
and plan for each medical illness:
.
.
Community Acquired Pneumonia: significant consolidation on CT
[**8-11**] associated with hypoxia. On broad Abx (vanc, zosyn,
azithro). Were unable to get sputum for resp cx and bronch too
high risk (esp given hypoxia) so will keep broad Abx for 10day
course.
- today is day [**5-7**] of Vanc/zosyn. Can d/c azithro today.
-keep on 6L O2, titrate to keep sats around 93% (monitor with
activity, which is when he desaturates). He may need screening
for outpt O2 for some time, however should see some decrease in
requirements
-since he is still coughing w/o much sputum production, will
change him from duonebs to albuterol + mucomyst nebs q4,
guaifenesin.
-he should be on incentive spirometer and OOB and ambulating as
tolerated.
-there was some concern for post for postobstructive PNA given
severity, but will w/u with bronch only if pt fails to improve
on current regimen (monitor O2 requirements). he needs f/u
imaging for resolving infiltrate in 4-6weeks
-note legionella was negative. Also CTA negative for PE.
-NOTE, picc line not placed here for elevated INR (3.5).
coumadin is held and PICC will be placed at LTAC
.
.
Hypertension: Currently well controlled on home regimen of
lisinopril 40, nifedipine 60, metoprolol 12.5mg [**Hospital1 **].
-given h/o Afib and Echo findings of EF 75% and likley diastolic
HF in this 84year old male, rate control will be very important.
Would reccommend evaluation by PCP to see if nifedipine can be
titrated down and metoprolol titrated up (he denies any h/o
reactive airway disease)
.
.
Afib: rate controlled on metoprolol 12.5mg [**Hospital1 **]. Of note, dig
level slighlty elevated on admission 1.2 for this 84year old
male and his dose was decreased to 0.0625 (was 0.125).
-as above, rate control is important in this patient who will
easily develop pulm edema from diastolic HF (EF 75%) in setting
of tachycardia.
- coumadin held
