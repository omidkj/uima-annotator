42 male found down on [**Location (un) **] St. Found to have pinpoint pupils,

with increasing wakefullness. His BS was initially 114. He was
unable to give a history, but admitted to recent use of cocaine
and valium (roughly #20 10mg tabs), as well as confirming that
he is homeless. He complained of some knee pain and foot pain,
presumably from a fall. He started in a methadone clinic last
week, and is scheduled to receive 60mg today.

ED COURSE: He was given 0.4mg narcan, to which he woke up a bit.
He then spiked to 103.1, cultured, and was given IV ceftriaxone
and vancomycin. An LP was performed which showed 3 WBC and 43
RBC and no overt sign of infection. A RUQ ultrasound was
essentially normal. A repeat CXR showed possible infiltrate. He
was then started on flagyl. He was still difficult to arouse,
and was started on a narcan gtt and transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for
closer monitoring.

days of productive cough. He denies any SOB. He has not had any

Brief Hospital Course:
42 year old male with a history of hepatitis C and polysubstance
abuse (cocaine, benzodiazepines, heroin) presents with an
opiate/valium overdose.

1) Altered MS / Overdose: He admits to taking methadone at the
clinic as scheduled. He recently had his doctor write a script
for valium, and he took most of the bottle yesterday. He also
took cocaine, but denies heroin since starting methadone. He was
intially placed on a narcan gtt in ED. Upon tranfer to the
floor, narcan gtt was stopped and patient more alert. Repeat
urine tox was still positive for benzos, opioids, methadone, and
cocaine. Of note, per pathology, levaquin can cause false
positives for opioids. The patient was restarted on methadone
(55 mg, confirmed with methadone clinic) and, at time of
discharge, had no evidence of withdrawal. Social work followed
the patient throughout his hospital course. The patient
expressed a desire for drug rehabilitation and, at time of
discharge, he was on several waiting lists.

2) Community acquired pneumonia: The patient completed a 10 day
course of levofloxacin (sputum culture grew MSSA sensitive to
levofloxacin) and, at time of discharge was afebrile with stable
O2 saturation on room air. Additional infectious work-up
included blood, urine, CSF cultures, all of which are negative
to date.

3) Hepatitis C: The patient had mild ALT/AST elevation on
admission, which was normalizing at time of discharge. A right
upper quadrant ultrasound was without evidence of biliary
dilitation. He will follow-up with liver clinic as an
outpatient.
