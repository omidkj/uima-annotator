History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 83424**] is a 52 year-old woman who has a 6-month of history
of neurologic deterioration and failure to thrive. She was
completely functional and working as a cook until 11/[**2149**]. At
that time her daugter became aware of worsening confusion and
decreasing ability to communicate. She moved in with her
daughter who has become her primary caretaker. [**Name (NI) **] [**Name2 (NI) **] intake has
been declining gradually over this time, and she has lost ~80
pounds in 6 months. During the past 3 weeks she has also had
worsening R arm weakness.

She was admitted to [**Hospital1 **] [**Date range (1) 83425**]. At that time an
extensive work-up was undertaken. Her dysphagia was thought to
be secondary to bulbar weakness. She had a brain MRI and MRA
showing extensive white matter changes that were nonspecific.
She had a normal EEG and a CSF negative for fungal, viral, or
bacterial infection, and no oligoclonal bands.
Anticholinesterase and musk Ab titers were checked to rule out
myastehia and were pending a the time of discharge. ALS was
thought to be possible (although CPK normal), but EMG was
planned as an outpatient. She also underwent evaluation for
occult malignancy, including CT torso that was essentially
normal and colonoscopy. HIV was checked and negative. She was
discharged to rehab.
.
Concominant with this decline in her functional status, her
daugher noted that she coughs frequently after eating. This has
worsened in recent weeks, and for the past 3 days she has been
noticably short of breath and grunting with every expiration.
She has been essentially unable to eat. She presented to
[**Hospital1 **] on [**4-22**] after a bout of coughing and desaturation to
the low 80s after eating. She was admitted for one day. She was
given ceftriaxone and metronidazole for possible aspiration
pneumonia; however, given no CXR or clinical signs of PNA,
antibiotics were discontinued. She was seen by speech and
swallow who recommended pureed solids and nectar thickened
liquids in a supervised setting. She was discharged back to
rehab on [**4-23**].
.
Over the intervening three days, the patient has become
increasingly visibly short of breath with grunting. She
continues to have coughing fits after eating, and her daughter
has essentially not been feeding her. She was transferred to
[**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation.
.
In the ED, initial vital signs T 99.4, BP 126/76, HR 120, RR 22,
O2 Sat 100% on RA. T rose to 100.7, and she was persistnetly
tachycardic. CXR showed bibasilar atelectasis. She received 3 L
NS, tylenol 650 mg PR x 1 and levaquin 500 mg IV x 1.

Past Medical History:
- hypertension
- depression
- dysphagia
- right upper extremity weakness
- cognitive decline with past work-up as above

Social History:
Social History: Currently lives at a nursing home since her
discharge [**2151-4-9**]. Prior to that she had been living with her
daughter since [**10-10**]. She is dependent on NH staff for ADLs but
is ambulatory. She is a former smoker. She worked as a cook at a
hospital prior to her clinical medical decline last year.

Family History:
no history of neurologic illness

EEG:
IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal portable EEG recording due to
the slow
background and the bursts of generalized slowing. This
abnormality
suggests cortical and subcortical encephalopathy. Metabolic
disturbances, medications, and infections are among the most
common
causes. If the patient's disease process progresses, a follow-up
EEG
for comparison would be of further diagnostic value.
.
EMG (prelim): c/w motor neuron dz, likely amyotrophic lateral
sclerosis
.
RADIOLOGY:
CXR on admission: IMPRESSION: Bibasilar linear opacities likely
representing atelectasis.
.
CXR [**5-13**]:
FINDINGS: Since interval examination from [**2151-5-12**], there has
been improvement in previously noted large pneumoperitoneum. No
interval change in complete left lower lobe collapse with
associated leftward mediastinal shift since [**2151-4-28**]. The right
lung is clear with no new focal parenchymal opacities. No
pleural effusions or pneumothorax. Tracheostomy tube in stable
standard position. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable,
demonstrating normal heart size. Right PICC line with tip
terminating within the mid-to-lower SVC.
IMPRESSION: Stable left lower lobe collapse. Improved
pneumoperitoneum.
.
CT Head:
IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial pathology.
.
MRI Head:
IMPRESSION:
1. Multiple FLAIR hyperintense lesions in the frontal and the
parietal
subcortical white matter without enhancement or restricted
diffusion, some of the lesions, slightly more ill-defined
compared to the prior study. The
nature of these lesions is uncertain. The differential diagnosis
includes
post-inflammatory, post-infectious, demyelinating, vasculitis or
slightly
small vessel occlusive disease. However, given the patient's
condition,
clinical and lab correlation is recommended to exclude the
possibilities as mentioned earlier. In addition, comparison with
any remote imaging, is
available remote MR imaging, if available, would be helpful.
2. Interval development of bilateral mastoid air cells,
