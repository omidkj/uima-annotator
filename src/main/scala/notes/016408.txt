Findings
LEFT ATRIUM: Elongated LA.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Moderately dilated RA.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Mild symmetric LVH. Mildly dilated LV cavity.
Suboptimal technical quality, a focal LV wall motion abnormality
cannot be fully excluded. Moderately depressed LVEF. TDI E/e'
>15, suggesting PCWP>18mmHg. No resting LVOT gradient.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: RV not well seen. Paradoxic septal motion
consistent with prior cardiac surgery.

AORTA: Normal aortic diameter at the sinus level. Focal
calcifications in aortic root. Mildly dilated ascending aorta.
Focal calcifications in ascending aorta.

AORTIC VALVE: Bioprosthetic aortic valve prosthesis (AVR).
Normal AVR gradient.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. Moderate
mitral annular calcification.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets. Physiologic
TR. Normal PA systolic pressure.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Pulmonic valve not well seen.

PERICARDIUM: Small to moderate pericardial effusion. No
echocardiographic signs of tamponade.

GENERAL COMMENTS: Suboptimal image quality - poor echo windows.
Suboptimal image quality - bandages, defibrillator pads or
electrodes.
Conclusions
The left atrium is elongated. The right atrium is moderately
dilated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
The left ventricular cavity is mildly dilated. Due to suboptimal
technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be
fully excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
difficult to assess given limited images but appears to be
moderately depressed (LVEF= 30-35 %). Tissue Doppler imaging
suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure
(PCWP>18mmHg). Interventricular septal motion is normal. The
ascending aorta is mildly dilated. A bioprosthetic aortic valve
prosthesis is present. The aortic valve prosthesis appears well
seated, with normal ltransvalvular gradients. Leaflet motion not
adequately visualized. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. No mitral regurgitation is seen. The estimated
pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is a small
to moderate sized pericardial effusion. There are no
echocardiographic signs of tamponade.

IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with mildly dilated cavity and probably
moderately depressed left ventricular systolic function.
Elevated LV filling pressure. Bioprosthetic AVR with normal
gradients and no visualized aortic regurgitation. Small
pericardial effusion.
