Chest plain film [**2143-7-27**]:
The left subclavian CV line is unchanged in position, projecting
at the level of distal SVC. Heart contour is mildly enlarged.
Venous congestion is noted. Bilateral linear opacities are
visible at lung periphery. Pulmonary vascular congestion is also
noted at both lung hila. Areas of increased opacity within the
right lower lobe is consistent with hostory of pulmonary nodules
which are difficult to see due to the interstitial edema. Small
right pleural effusion is also present. The deformity of the
right chest wall is unchanged.


Brief Hospital Course:
1. fever/hypotension -- Initially admitted to the medical ICU
for concern of sepsis, particularly with an indwelling central
venous catheter.  Blood cultures were drawn, and empiric
coverage for staphylococcal bacteremia and community acquired
pneumonia (with vancomycin and levaquin) were initiated.  A CXR
showed new left lower infiltrate.  She improved without pressor
support, and was transferred to the general medicine team for
further care.  No obvious infectious source was delineated,
blood cultures did not grow organisms.  The vancomycin was
discontinued, and a full course of Levaquin was planned on
discharge.

2. deconditioning -- The patient's weakness and fatigue were a
large part of her subjective complaints surrounding admission.
She worked with PT daily, and will continue to have daily
physical therapy at home.

3. cardiomyopathy with LV dysfunction -- with normalized blood
pressures, she was instructed to resume her home carvedilol and
lisinopril at low doses.

4. metastatic breast cancer -- followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  No
active issues during her hospitalizations.  She has no pain
complaints on discharge.
