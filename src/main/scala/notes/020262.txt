Right side pain, cough

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 79 year old man with a history of atrial
fibrillation, COPD and CHF s/p aortic and mitral valve
replacement who presents with 1 day of right-sided chest pain.
He was in his usual state of health - living in an [**Hospital 4382**] facility and taking budesonide, xopenex, and ipratropium
nebulizers once a day with baseline congestion and sputum
production - until one week prior to admission, when he began to
experience increased congestion, increased frequency of cough,
and increased sputum production. He denies fevers, chills,
exposure to any known allergens, or sick contacts. One day prior
to admission, he noticed minimal blood streaking in his sputum.
He reports that he felt "lousy" at dinner and did not eat
anything becuase he thought he might vomit. He went back to his
quarters and fell asleep sitting up leaning on his right side.
He woke up at 1 am with a pain along his right chest, which he
described as sharp, [**9-23**], and focally over his lateral rib, and
worse upon deep inspiration, coughing, palpation, or movement.
He was unable to fall or stay asleep, which is highly unusual
for him. He denies vomiting or diarrhea, epistaxis, melena,
hematochezia, or hematuria. He denies a history of aspiration or
any difficulty with swallowing.
.
The next morning, he called a staff member and told her that he
was having right-sided chest pain. He came to the hospital via
EMS because he had not experienced this pain before. He was
unable to complete his nebulizer treatments during this time.
.
In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, initial VS were: Temp:98.6 HR:115 BP:118/70
Resp:28 O(2)Sat:95.  EKG showed atrial fibrillation and ST
depression v3-6. No prior EKGs for comparison. The cardiology
fellow felt that the ST depressions represented demand ischemia.
He received ASA 325 and had cardiac enzymes drawn. A CXR was
done which showed RML and RLL infiltrate suggestive of
pneumonia. INR was 5.5. Lactate 2.1. He had blood cultures
drawn, received 1.5L NS, levofloxacin, acetaminophen, tramadol,
and  ipratropium nebulizers. He reports that the pain resolved
while in the ED. He had a brief episode of hypotension with SBP
89 while in the ED; this responded rapidly to fluids.  He was
asymptomatic during this episode.
.
ROS: (+) Per HPI.  (-) Denies fever, chills, night sweats,
headache, vision changes, lightheadedness or dizziness, sore
throat, left-sided chest pain or pressure, abdominal pain,
changes in his bowel or bladder habits, BRBPR, dysuria,

The left atrium is mildly dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with normal cavity size and global systolic function
(LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall
motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. The right
ventricular cavity is moderately dilated with moderate global
free wall hypokinesis. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. A
bioprosthetic aortic valve prosthesis is present. The aortic
valve prosthesis appears well seated, with normal leaflet motion
and transvalvular gradients. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. A mitral valve
annuloplasty ring is present. The mitral annular ring appears
well seated with normal gradient. No mitral regurgitation is
seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of
