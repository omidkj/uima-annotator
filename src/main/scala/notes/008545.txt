CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory
failure.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  73-year-old male with a history
of hormone resistant prostate cancer diagnosed in [**2137**],
failed radiation seeds and Lupron therapy presented to he
Emergency [**2146-3-22**] with three weeks of progressive
shortness of breath.  The patient stated that over the past
six months he has noted poor exercise tolerance, inability to
lie flat but denied back pain, neurologic compromise, cough
or hemoptysis.  The patient's shortness of breath acutely
worsened in the past three days and the patient came to the
Emergency Room.  The patient denies fever, chills, sweats or
chest pain.  In the Emergency Room the patient was noted to
be hypoxic with paradoxical breaths and he was placed on
pressure support mask, ventilation and had three liters of
grossly bloody fluid drawn off the from the right lung by the
Intensive Care Unit team under supervision of Interventional
Pulmonary.  Repeat chest x-ray revealed no pneumothorax and
clear lung fields except two perihilar masses.  The patient
was on four liters nasal cannula at that time sating 98% and
seemed symptomatically greatly improved.  The patient was
taken to the medical floor for further management but this
morning the patient was noted to be tachypneic, hypoxic with
an arterial blood gases revealing the following numbers 7.31,
60, 78, with O2 sats in the 94% range on two liters nasal
cannula with patient using accessory muscles and the patient
was noted to be quite lethargic and somnolent.  Floor team
noticed decreased breath sounds halfway up in the right lung
field and a third of the way up in the left lung field with
dullness to percussion with a respiratory rate at that time
25.  A chest CT was performed which revealed numerous
metastatic processes within the lungs and mediastinum with
some constriction of the right pulmonary artery.  The patient
was seen once again by the Interventional Pulmonary team who
checked a repeat chest x-ray which revealed rapid
re-accumulation of effusion and at that time the
recommendation was made to consider admission to Intensive
Care Unit secondary to the patient's persistent tachypnea and
relative hypoxia.

The patient was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit team
for further management.

bilaterally throughout lungs and mediastinum, bulky
lymphadenopathy in the hilar region.  Arterial blood gases:
7.39, 60, 78, on four liters nasal cannula, lactate 0.9.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the Intensive
Care Unit service for hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory
failure.  Mask ventilation was continued to prevent
respiratory compromise.  Cytology revealed the patient had
metastatic prostate cancer and it was thought that this was
the cause of the patient's rapidly re-accumulating pleural
effusions.  The patient was also found to have a post
obstructive pneumonia and aggressive chest physical therapy
and bronchoscopy was considered for sputum removal.  It was
thought that the patient would not benefit from bronchoscopy
and that his pulmonary function was compromised on numerous
fronts.  Ultrasound was performed by Interventional Pulmonary
service to ascertain if he had re-accumulated any pleural
effusion for further thoracentesis and it was found at that
time that the patient's right diaphragm was greatly elevated
which was the cause of his decreased breath sounds on the
right.  It was thought that there was probable phrenic nerve
involvement of the metastatic process and this had caused
diaphragmatic compromise on the right.  The Interventional
Pulmonary Team felt there would be no benefit in
thoracentesis since pleural effusions were small and probably
not compromising the patient's oxygenation and ventilation
significantly.

It was thought that the patient's metastatic process was
causing the patient's pulmonary compromise.  Oncology team
was consulted and they stated that the patient's prognosis
was poor.  The attending physician, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and myself had a
thorough discussion with the family, explained these findings
and given the fact that the patient's pulmonary function was
severely compromised due to metastatic process which could
not be resolved it was thought that intubation and cardiac
resuscitation would not be appropriate.  The family
understood the patient's condition and decided after
discussion with the patient himself that [**Last Name (STitle) **] would be the
primary objective.

After lengthy discussions with the palliative care team and
social work the family decided to make Mr. [**Known lastname 7749**] [**Last Name (Titles) **]
measures only and he was placed on a Morphine drip.  All
antibiotics and non-essential medications were withdrawn and
the patient was taken off of mask ventilation and succumbed
to respiratory failure in 24 hours.

The family deferred autopsy.

DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Respiratory failure secondary to metastatic prostate
    cancer.
2.  Rapidly re-accumulating malignant effusions.
3.  Post obstructive pneumonia.
