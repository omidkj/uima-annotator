quit six years ago.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Her father has diabetes and had an
myocardial infarction.  Mother had an myocardial infarction.
Brother had an myocardial infarction.  Negative for cancer.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION UPON TRANSFER TO [**Hospital1 212**] MEDICINE
SERVICE:  Temperature 97.7.  Heart rate 85.  Blood pressure
92/palpable.  Respiratory rate 18.  O2 sat 100% on 4 liters.
General the patient appears comfortable and in no acute
distress.  Neck 8 cm JVD.  Positive hepatojugular reflex.
Chest clear at apices.  Decreased breath sounds at right
base.  Coarse crackles half way up bilaterally.  Heart
irregular, clicking noises when resolved when holding breath.
Regular rate and rhythm.  Normal S1 and S2.  No murmurs, rubs
or gallops.  Abdomen positive bowel sounds, all quadrants,
soft, nontender, nondistended.  No hepatosplenomegaly.
Extremities 2+ pedal pulses bilaterally, trace edema, cool
extremities, no cyanosis, Pneumoboots in place.

PERTINENT LABORATORIES/X-RAYS/EKGS AND OTHER TESTS:  On
[**2127-7-15**] hematocrit was 23.0.  On [**2127-7-15**] the patient was
ruled out for an myocardial infarction.  Her CKs were 86,
112, 89, troponin was 0.18, 0.2, 0.14.  Swab taken [**2127-7-12**]
from right chest tube site revealed 1+ polys on gram stain,
carinii bacteria and coag negative staph with two colonial
morphologies.  Chest x-ray on [**2127-7-21**] showed no evidence of
cardiac failure, multiple right sided rib fractures, soft
tissue thickening consistent with stable versus resolved
hematoma, loculated right pleural effusion with atelectasis
at right base, no pneumothorax, left lung is well aerated.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  On the early morning of [**2127-7-15**] the patient
was transferred from the surgery service to the trauma CICU
for increased respiratory stress and agitation.  Her O2 sats
dropped to 70% when not on O2, but improved to 100% on 4
liters by face mask.  She was also found to be hypercarbic on
blood gas.  She was confused, tachycardic and tachypneic.  A
chest x-ray showed no changes with no congestive heart
failure and no pneumothorax.  A Foley was placed and an A
line was placed for access for repeated arterial blood gas.
She was transfused 2 units of packed red blood cells for a
hematocrit of 23.0 on [**7-15**].  She also was ruled out for an
myocardial infarction.  Her CKs and troponins increased
slightly, however, this was not felt to be consistent with a
myocardial infarction.  On [**7-16**] she was started on a beta
blocker, Captopril and aspirin.  Her neurological examination
fluctuated from being calm to restless and agitated.  A CTE
was performed revealing prior anterior septal and apical
akinesis with global hypokinesis and an EF of 25 to 30%.  On
[**7-17**] she was transferred to the MICU.  She demonstrated
evidence of decompensated heart failure and had hypotension
to systolic blood pressures of 70 with codeine.  She showed
she was very sensitive to Captopril and beta blockers and
subsequently dropped her systolic blood pressures and
required several boluses of intravenous fluids.

On [**7-18**] she was transferred to the regular medical floor and
her beta blockers and ace inhibitors were held given her
history of hypotension.  She was diuresed with Lasix, which
improved her O2 requirements and her tachypnea.  On [**7-19**] she
demonstrated an elevated white blood cell count from 12 to 19
and underwent a repeat chest x-ray, repeat blood culture and
urinalysis and urine culture.  Her chest x-ray showed no
change from previously seen right loculated effusion and
showed no evidence of congestive heart failure.  Her urine
culture showed 10 to 100,000 yeast.  Her blood cultures are
negative to date.  On [**7-21**] the patient remained afebrile and
continued to clinically improve.  Her O2 requirements
decreased to 2 and then 1 liter of oxygen by nasal cannula.
She was seen by physical therapy who felt she needed further
rehab.  They recommended she needed ability training,
therapeutic exercises and monitoring of her pulmonary status.
On [**7-22**] she continued to clinically improve.  Her breathing
was subjectively improving.  She received a bed at the [**Hospital 533**]
Rehab.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  To rehab facility.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Right rib fractures status post chest tube insertions

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Nortriptyline 75 mg q.h.s.
2.  Gabapentin 600 mg t.i.d.

5.  Levofloxacin 500 mg q.d. times five days.
6.  Aspirin 325 mg.
7.  Timolol 0.25% eye drops b.i.d.
8.  Guaifenesin 100 mg per 5 ml syrup 5 to 10 ml q 6 hours as
needed.
9.  Codeine 15 to 30 mg q 4 to 6 hours prn.
10.  Bisacodyl 10 mg po q.d. prn.
11.  Nitroglycerin sublingual 0.3 mg prn chest pain.

FOLLOW UP PLANS:  The patient was instructed to follow up
with the trauma clinic in one to two weeks after discharge.
She is also instructed to follow up with her primary care
physician in two weeks following discharge.  Also she was
instructed to make an appointment with a cardiologist

fraction.
