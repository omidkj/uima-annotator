History of Present Illness:
HPI: This is an 86 yo F with a past medical history of dementia,

who has been recently treated for a UTI with cipro and then
started on flagyl for c diff, referred to [**Hospital1 18**] ED from nursing
home after she was found to have a BUN/Cr 140/11.7 with no prior
history of renal failure.
.
In the ED, she was found to be alert and confused, seemingly at
baseline with intermittent agitation, and with stable vitals.
She was found to have low urine output, and hyperkalemia. She
was given calcium gluconate, insulin and kayexalate and renal
was consulted, who felt that her renal failure was likely
secondary to dehydration from cdiff and recommended IVF
hydration. She had a renal ultrasound that was negative for
nephrolithiasis, hydronephrosis or free fluid. She was also
incidentally found to have a left sided pleural effusion.
.
She was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for further management of her
acute renal failure for increased level of nursing care
secondary to agitation.
