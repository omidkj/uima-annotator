[**2180-3-16**] Cardiac Catheterization
 1. Coronary angiography revealed a right dominant system. The
LMCA
showed a discrete 50% stenosis in its distal segment.  The LAD
showed
diffuse stenoses not more than 30% throughout its length.  The
LCX
showed a proximal 100% stenosis with left to left collaterals to
the
distal segment via an OM branch.  The RCA showed a 100% proximal

occlusion with left to right collaterals to the distal segment.
 2. Left ventriculography revealed global hypokinesis with an
ejection fraction of 32%. There was no evidence of mitral
regurgitation.
 3. Limited hemodynamics revealed mildly elevated left
ventricular
end-diastolic pressure of 18mmHg, suggestive of diastolic
dysfunction.
There was no pressure gradient across the aortic valve upon
pullback of
the pigtail catheter.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Mild diastolic ventricular dysfunction.
3. Moderate systolic ventricular dysfunction.

[**2180-6-16**] Carotid Ultrasound
Mild carotid artery disease bilaterally, associated with luminal
narrowings less than 40% in diameter reduction on the right side
versus between 40 and 59% on the left.

[**2180-6-19**] ECHO
Pre-CPB: No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the left atrial
appendage. There is severe global left ventricular hypokinesis.
The left ventricle is thin and enlarged. Resting regional wall
motion abnormalities include global severe hypokinesis, with
akinesis of apex.. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. There are simple atheroma in the ascending
aorta.  The descending thoracic aorta is mildly dilated. There
are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
There are three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) are mildly thickened. The left cusp is hypokinetic. No
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There
is no pericardial effusion.
Post-CPB: Preserved RV systolic fxn. Improved global LV systolic
fxn. EF=35 - 40% on Epinephrine infusion. Inferior and posterior
walls remain more hypokinetic than others. No MR, no AI. Aorta
intact. Other parameters as pre-CPB.

[**2180-6-21**] CXR
There has been interval removal of the endotracheal tube,
mediastinal drains and left-sided chest tube. There are
persistent areas of atelectasis bilaterally including the left
upper lobe. No pneumothorax is evident. There is no evidence for
failure or effusions. The patient is again noted to be status
post CABG.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 11426**] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2180-6-17**] for further
evaluation of his chest pain. He underwent a cardiac
catheterization which revealed severe three vessel disease with
a left ventricular ejection fraction of 25%. Given the severity
of his disease, the cardiac surgery service was consulted for
surgical management. Mr. [**Known lastname 11426**] was worked-up in the usual
preoperative manner including a carotid duplex ultrasound which
revealed mild carotid artery disease bilaterally, associated
with luminal narrowings less than 40% in diameter reduction on
the right side versus between 40 and 59% on the left. An
echocardiogram was performed which showed trivial mitral
regurgitation, mild left ventricular hypertrophy and an ejection
fraction of 30%. On [**2180-6-19**], Mr. [**Known lastname 11426**] was taken to the
operating room where he underwent coronary artery bypass
grafting to three vessels. Postoperatively he was taken to the
cardiac surgical intensive care unit for monitoring. By
postoperative day one, Mr. [**Known lastname 11426**] was awake and extubated.
Aspirin, a statin and beta blockade were started. He was then
transferred to the step down unit for further recovery. He was
gently diuresed towards his preoperative weight. The physical
therapy service was consulted for assistance with his
postoperative strength and mobility. Beta blockade was increased
for tachycardia. An ace inhibitor was started for blood pressure
control and his low ejection fraction. His creatinine remained
stable at 1.4. Mr. [**Known lastname 11426**] continued to make steady progress and
was discharged home on postoperative day four. He will follow-up
with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 914**], his cardiologist and his primary care
physician as an outpatient. On discharge, his wounds were clean,
dry and intact and all vital signs were stable.
