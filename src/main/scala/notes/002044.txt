Cardiac Cath x 2 with stenting


History of Present Illness:
85y/o M w/ h/o CAD s/p CABG, HTN, Hypercholesterolemia, remote
tobacco history who was in USOH PTA. He had been hospitalized
for a pneumonia ~6 weeks ago, treated and sent home on 2L
oxygen. One month ago he was able to walk up a flight of stairs
(12 steps) without any dificulty or DOE. Up until one week ago
he started noticing that he could not walk up the full flight of
stairs, he would stop at 6 steps [**12-30**] SOB and abdominal
pressure/tightness. 2.5 days ago he could only go up 4 stairs
prior to symptoms starting, he also noticed that he developed a
pressure around his waist that waxed and waned in intensity.
This morning, he quickly became sob with minimal exertion
lasting 30min before recovering his breath. He dressed himself,
washed and shaved and was readily out of breath, developed
pressure around his waist that was worse than before [**9-7**] non
radiating, no LH/dizziness/N/V. He gave himself oxygen which
helped ease both the abdominal tightness and SOB. He called EMS
who found him to have a P: 84, BP: 170/80, R: 24, O2 84% on 2L
then switched to NRB iwth O2 95%, they gave him lasix 40mg and 2
baby asa and was taken to [**Name (NI) 1474**] Hospital. There he was noted
to be in florid heart failure, given NTG, Morpine 2mg+2mg, lasix
40mg, started on NTG drip, 2 baby asa, lovenox 80mg sc, mucomyst
600mg iv, lopressor 2.5mg, and started on Tirofiban. Hct was
46.4, wbc 13.2, BUN 46, Cr 2.3, CK 67, TropI 0.5.
He was subsequently transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for cardiac
catherization.
Upon arrival to floor patients face was dark red/almost purple,
c/o severe abdominal pressure, non radiating, acutely sob, no
LH/Dizziness, no N/V. He was tachypneic on NRB with sats in the
high 80's/low 90's, JVD ~14cm, heart RRR, lungs with crackles
from bases to [**12-31**] of lung field. He was given 80mg iv lasix, 2mg
of morphine, started on heparin iv, then given additional 100mg
of iv lasix.  CXR with pulmonary congestion/edema, sats improved
to the low 90's and no longer was desating with conversation.
ABG's showed 7.39/34/48-> 7.34/39/63-->7.37/39/76. He diuresed
2L total after 180mg of lasix and was no longer in distress,
abdominal pain resolved after 10min on floor. Patient still on
NRB.

[**11-3**] Echo
1. The left atrium is mildly dilated.
2. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and systolic
function are
normal (LVEF>55%). Regional left ventricular wall motion is
normal. Due to
suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality
cannot be fully
excluded.
3. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
4. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+)
mitral
regurgitation is seen.
5. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.

[**11-4**] Stress MIBI
1) Moderate, reversible inferior and inferolateral wall
perfusion
defect. 2) Slight hypokinesis of the lateral wall with
calculated ejection
fraction of 46%.

[**11-5**] Cath
1.  Selective coronary angiograpy of this right dominant system
revealed
multi-vessel disease.  The LMCA contained mild, diffuse disease.
 The
LAD was occluded mid vessel and filled via SVG-D.  The LCX was
occluded
proximally.  The RCA had diffuse disease up to as much as 80%
stenosed.
2.  Vein graft imaging revealed patent LIMA-LAD without
significant
disease.  The SVG-RPL was totally occluded.  The SVG-D1 had
70-80%
lesions proximally.
3. Resting hemodynamics revealed a severely elevated mean PCPW
of
22mmHg.  The Cardiac Index by the Fick method was 2.3 l/min/m2.
4. Successful stenting of the SVG to RPL with distal to proximal

overlapping Cypher DESs (3.0x33, 3.0x33, and 3.5x23) (See PTCA
comments).

[**11-7**] Cath
1. Selective angiography of the recently stented SVG to
the RPL revealed widely patent stents. The SVG to the LAD had a
80%
proximal stenosis.
2. Successful stenting of the proximal segment of the SVG to the
LAD
with a 3.5x18mm Cypher [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 7930**] with a 4.5x12mm Quantum
MAverick
at 20 atms using Filterwire EZ RX for distal protection (See
PTCA
comments).


Brief Hospital Course:
85y/o M with CAD s/p CABG, diastolic heart failure, HTN,
hypercholesterolemia, p/w 2 day history of USA and acute
pulmonary edema.

1. CV: History c/w UA progressing to ACS.
CAD: Patient arrived on Tirofiban [**12-30**] his ARF and NTG gtt. We
started patient on heparin, asprin full dose, metoprolol,
holding acei, started lipitor.  NTG gtt titrated to relieve
pain.  Once initially stabalized the pt had no chest pain for
the entire admission.  Once resp status stabalize pt sent for a
stress MIBI which demonsrated a reversible inf/inf-lat perfusion
defecit with HK of the lat wall.  He was sent to cath where the
pt was found to have multi vessel disease.  The SVG-RPL was
stented with overlapping stents.  He was brought back for repeat
cath and stenting of the SVG-LAD.  With both caths the pt was
prehyd with Na Bicarb and mucomyst.  His groin cath sites did
not have evidence of eccymoses or bleeding.  He had a small
hematoma on the R which was stable.  He also has been
hemodynamically stable throughout the admission.  The pt will be
sent out on ASA, plavix, ACEI, lipitor, and B Blocker.

Pump: supposed EF of 60-65% with diastolic heart failure,
patient presently in acute heart failure and hypoxic. Nitro gtt
was given for after
