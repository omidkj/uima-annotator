shortness of breath

Bronchoscopy


History of Present Illness:
76 year old woman with history of HTN, COPD and psychiatric
illness presenting with increased left breast size and worsening
dyspnea on exertion. Symptoms started approximately 5 days ago
and have progressed to where her left breast is 4-6 times larger
than her right breast. The dyspnea on exertion began ~2 days ago
(patient is unable to really recall at this point) and has
worsened, now including some symptoms even with just talking
(previously had some dyspnea with exertion). Reports some cough
across past few days, unclear if productive. She denies any
chest pain, fevers, nipple discharge or specific breast pain. No
trauma.
.
On arrival in the ED her initial VS were 97.5 119/71 72 20
98/4L. Left breast noted to be enlarged and mildly erythematous.
She was started on vancomycin with concern for cellulitis. CXR
was felt to be concerning for a LLL infiltrate and she was
started on levoquin for CAP. An EKG showed slow atrial
fibrilation. A bedside echocardiogram was performed which showed
a pericardial effusion.
.
Denies any chest pain, fevers, chills, night sweats, nausea,
vomiting, diarrhea, dizziness, light-headedness.

TTE ([**2192-10-17**])
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated. The estimated right atrial pressure is
10-20mmHg. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy
with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function
(LVEF>55%). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left
ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). The right
ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with borderline normal free
wall function. [Intrinsic right ventricular systolic function is
likely more depressed given the severity of tricuspid
regurgitation.] There is abnormal septal motion/position
consistent with right ventricular pressure/volume overload.
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. The
aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is no
aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral
valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Moderate
to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is severe
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. Significant pulmonic
regurgitation is seen. There is a small circumferential
pericardial effusion without echocardiographic signs of
tamponade.

Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable
for review) of [**2185-9-5**], the right ventricular cavity is now
dilated and severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension is now
present. The severity of tricuspid regurgitation is also
increased and a small circumferential pericardial effusion is
now present.

Mammogram ([**2192-10-18**])
IMPRESSION:
1. Diffuse left breast skin and trabecular thickening with
associated diffuse edema of the left breast tissue. No evidence
of pathologically enlarged left axillary nodes. Differential
considerations would include fluid overload related to
congestive heart failure (unilateral in this patient who states
that she preferentially sleeps with her left side down),
mastitis, or a diffuse infiltrative process such that can be
seen with inflammatory breast cancers or lymphoma. Clinical
correlation is advised and any decision to biopsy at this time
should be based on the clinical assessment.

CT Chest w/o contrast ([**2192-10-26**])
FINDINGS: The thyroid gland is unremarkable. There is extensive
atherosclerotic calcification involving the arch of the aorta
and coronary arteries. There is moderate-to-severe cardiomegaly
with a small pericardial effusion. Numerous mediastinal lymph
nodes measure up to 8 mm in short axis diameter are present. No
axillary or hilar lymphadenopathy.

In the tracheobronchial tree, there is moderate narrowing of the
trachea and more se
