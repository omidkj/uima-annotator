History of Present Illness:
This 75 year old female has a history
of cardiomyopathy with a 30% EF, and a DDD pacemaker and has

was unsuccessful.  She had a CS dissection and further attempts
were abandoned.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 914**] was consulted for atrial lead
placement via left thorocotomy.

Intra-op Echo [**2122-4-29**]
Conclusions
This is a limited, directed study to monitor for cardiac injury
during lead extraction and thoracotomy for epicardial lead
placement.
No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the left atrial
appendage.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed
(LVEF= 15 - 20 %). with moderate global free wall hypokinesis.
There is akinesis of the inferior and distal walls.
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with
good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral
valve leaflets are moderately thickened. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.

No changes after the procedure was complete


Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was brought to the operating room on [**2122-4-29**] where
the patient underwent placement of 2 left ventricular pacing
leads.  Overall the patient tolerated the procedure well and
post-operatively was transferred to the CVICU in stable
condition for recovery and invasive monitoring.  Vancomycin was
used for surgical antibiotic prophylaxis.  POD 1 found the
patient extubated, alert and oriented and breathing comfortably.
 The patient was neurologically intact and hemodynamically
stable on no inotropic or vasopressor support.  Beta blocker was
initiated and the patient was gently diuresed toward the
preoperative weight.  The patient was transferred to the
telemetry floor for further recovery.  Chest tube was
discontinued without complication.  The patient was evaluated by
the physical therapy service for assistance with strength and
mobility.  By the time of discharge on POD 3 the patient was
ambulating freely, the wound was healing and pain was controlled
with oral analgesics.  The patient was discharged home in good
condition with appropriate follow up instructions.
