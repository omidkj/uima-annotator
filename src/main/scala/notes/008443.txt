No significant change when compared to prior exam in terms of
subarachnoid hemorrhage or shift of normally midline structures.
Slight
increased right frontal lobe and left frontal lobe hypodensities
(2, 8) is
identified and may represent possible infarct or edema.

1. Unchanged bifrontal hypodensities anterior to the suprasellar
cistern,
which may represent edema or evolving infarction.
2. No significant change in extensive subarachnoid hemorrhage
and

Final Report
EXAM: CTA of the head.

CLINICAL INFORMATION: Patient with subarachnoid hemorrhage
status post
coiling.

FINDINGS: There is subarachnoid hemorrhage identified
predominantly seen in
the sulci at the convexity and in the interhemispheric region.
Small amount
of intraventricular blood is seen. There is a right-sided
ventricular drain
extending to the posterior portion of the body of the right
lateral ventricle.
There is no hydrocephalus seen. There is mild hypodensity of the
inferior
portion of both frontal lobes, which is unclear whether due to
presence of
blood within the sulci in this region.

CT ANGIOGRAPHY OF THE HEAD:

CT angiography of the head demonstrates a coil pack in the
region of left
posterior communicating artery. No definite residual aneurysm is
visualized.
No other aneurysms are seen in the arteries of anterior and
posterior
circulation. No other aneurysms are seen.

There is mild narrowing of both proximal middle cerebral
arteries and A1
segments of both anterior cerebral arteries which may indicate
minimal spasm.
There is no occlusive spasm identified, however.

IMPRESSION: No prior studies are available. CT head demonstrates
a
subarachnoid hemorrhage with ventricular drain. No
hydrocephalus. CT
angiography demonstrates a coil pack in the region of left
posterior
communicating artery without visualization of residual aneurysm
but the
evaluation in the surrounding area of the coil is limited due to
artifacts. No
other aneurysms are seen. Minimal nonocclusive vasospasm is
visualized.

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST   Clip # [**Clip Number (Radiology) 103484**]
Final Report
HISTORY: 59-year-old woman with new onset seizure in setting of
subarachnoid
hemorrhage and bleeding from attempted replacement of
ventricular drain.
Evaluate for increase in bleed.

HEAD CT: Contiguous axial imaging was performed through the
brain without IV
contrast administration.

COMPARISON: CT head [**2159-5-9**] at 10:27 a.m. (this new studies

approximately 5 hours after).

FINDINGS: There is a stable large left frontal acute
intraparenchymal
hemorrhage measuring approximately 7 x 3.8 cm with surrounding
vasogenic
edema. This large left intraparenchymal hemorrhage causes
rightward shift of
midline of approximately 10 mm which has slightly increased in
size compared
to prior study and is likely causing subfalcial herniation.
Large volume of
hyperdense blood is seen in the left lateral ventricle layering
in the
occipital [**Doctor Last Name 534**], third, and fourth ventricles. No sign of
hydrocephalus. The
right frontal approach ventriculostomy catheter is in unchanged
position.
There is stable subarachnoid hemorrhage, most notably within the
left sylvian
fissure but also layering along the right lateral convexity. No
new areas of
hemorrhage are present. There is a left MCA coil. There is
persistent
hypodensity in the right frontal lobe (2:8), which may be
related to site of
prior infarction. There is trace pneumocephalus layering along
the left
frontal convexity at site of surgical burr hole. There are
surgical burr
holes in bilateral frontal calvarium (2:23). Otherwise, osseous
structures
appear intact. There is mucosal thickening of bilateral
sphenoid, and ethmoid
sinuses. Frontal sinuses are clear. Fluid is seen in bilateral
mastoid air
cells.

IMPRESSION:
1. Stable size of left frontal intraparenchymal hemorrhage,
however, there is
slightly more rightward shift of midline now 10 mm with likely
subfalcial
herniation.
2. Stable ventricular size with stable position of right frontal
approach
ventriculostomy catheter with tip in right lateral ventricle.
3. Stable subarachnoid hemorrhage, most prominent in the left
sylvian
fissure.
4. Stable hemorrhage in the left lateral ventricle, third, and
fourth
ventricles. No evidence for uncal or tonsillar herniation.
