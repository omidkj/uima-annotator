History of Present Illness:
74 yo man with PMH significant for severe COPD on home O2, HTN
initially presented to [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] on [**2117-7-23**] with
dyspnea/respiratory distress. Patient called his neighbor, who
called EMS. EMS found him in tripod position, talking in [**2-23**]
word sentences, RR 35-40. He reported having dyspnea for [**1-22**]
hours, but COPD flare for past few days. On arrival vitals were
T 96, HR 179, BP 149/85, RR 30-40, O2 sat 94% on 100% NRB. He
had difficulty talking in sentences and was diaphoretic. He
reported running out of his medications at home. He was
immediately intubated and given nebs, solumedrol 125 mg, IVF,
and Levaquin 750 mg. He was transferred to the ICU. While there,
he was given 5-6 L IVF to support his BP. He was continued on
COPD flare treatment. Patient developed elevated cardiac
biomarkers and hypotension on [**7-24**], and transfer to [**Hospital1 18**] CCU was
coordinated. Heparin gtt was started prior to transfer. Femoral
line was placed in ICU prior to transfer.
.
On route by [**Location (un) **] ground transport, patient had SBP 76.
Received 500cc IVF and propofol was decreased from 30 to 10,
however patient woke up and profolol was increased again. He was
started on Levophed 5 mcg/min, and SBP came up to 100. HR was in
90's. He also received albuterol nebs for wheezing, and Fentanyl
250 mcg. He remained on 100% O2, since sat dropped to 92% when
O2 turned down to 70%.
.
Patient denies any chest pain, abd pain now. [**Month (only) 116**] have had chest
pain at home. Rest of ROS deferred b/c intubated.

EKG ([**2117-7-23**]) sinus tachy at rate 140, w/ PAB's
[**2117-7-24**]: 1st degree AV block, rate 100, rightward axis, low
voltages, Q waves in II, III, aVF (unchanged from prior), new
0.5 mm STe in I, avF, V4 and V5, and TwI in V4-V5, poor R wave
progression.
.
CXR ([**2117-7-23**]): No cardiopulmonary abnormality. ET tube in place.
[**2117-7-24**]: hyperinflated lungs, no e/o pulmonary edema/congestion,
no cardiomegaly
.
CXR on [**2117-8-9**]:
 FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph on [**2117-8-8**],
the course of the right-sided PICC line and tracheostomy tube
are in unchanged position. No evidence of changes in the lung
parenchyma. There is unchanged massive overinflation with
bilateral pleural and parenchymal scars. No evidence of
overhydration. No newly occurred focal parenchymal opacity
suggestive of pneumonia.
.
2D-ECHOCARDIOGRAM ([**2117-7-24**]): EF 30-35%, good movement of base
with diffuse hypokinesis of left ventricle from mid-section to
apex.  RV with good basal motion, hypokinesis of apex.  Mild TR,
no pericardial effusion.

.
Cardiac catheterization ([**2117-7-28**]):
1. Coronary angiography in the right dominant system demonstrate
no
coronary artery disease. The LMCA had no angriographically
apparent
disease. The LAD had no angiographically apparent disease. The
Cx had no
angiographically apparent disiease. The RCA has no
angiograpgically
apparent disease.
2. Resting hemodynamics revealed normal right and left sided
filling
pressures (RA pressure had A wave of 13 mmHg and v wave of 12
mmHg). The
cardiac index was elevated at 6.0. The wedge pressure was 14
mmHg.
Aortic pressure were 116/ 69 mmHg with mean of 91 mmHg.
.
Echocardiogram ([**2117-7-29**]):
The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. The
estimated right atrial pressure is 10-15mmHg. Left ventricular
wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There is very mild
regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with distal
apical hypokinesis. Overall left ventricular systolic function
is normal (LVEF>55%). The right ventricular free wall is
hypertrophied. The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated
with normal free wall contractility. The ascending aorta is
mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Trace aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is severe pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial
effusion. There is an anterior space which most likely
represents a fat pad.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2117-7-24**], the
left ventricular has significantly improved with very minor
residue apical hypokinesis. Severe pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension is now detected.
.
DEFERRED SWALLOWING EVALUATION ([**2117-8-9**]):
He has h/o severe COPD and is still recovering from a recent
ventilator-associated pneumonia. Trach collar was attempted x2
over the weekend with poor tolerance and long recovery period
afterwards. Today pt remains on relatively high vent settings.
He has not tolerated trach collar and per discussion with RT, is
not likely to tolerate cuff deflation for PMV on the vent or for
swallow evaluation.  In addition, given pt's severe lung
disease, and recovering PNA, he likely has low tolerance for
even a small
amount of aspiration.  As such, swallowing evaluation is
deferred.
.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 74 yo M w/ PMHx HTN, COPD presents with
respiratory failure, now transferred from [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] with
respiratory failure s/p intubation, elevated cardiac enzymes,
and hypotension requiring pressors.
.
# Respiratory failure/COPD: Patient has baseline severe COPD on
home O2, with huge hyperinflation on CXR, presenting symptoms
consistent with a COPD flare (tripod position, wheezing) and
reported not taking meds at home.  Patient arrived intubated
from outside hospital.
