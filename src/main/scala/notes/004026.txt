Chief Complaint:
palpitations

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
cardioversion


History of Present Illness:
78 yo F w/ PMH Afib on coumadin who presents with a "racing
heart". Patient states that she exeprienced palpitatins one day
ago, however was unsure if she was in a. fib. She had an appt
with PCP for neck pain when ECG done showed a. fib with RVR so
she was sent to ED. She denies any chest pain, sob,
palpitations. denies doe. Denies recent fevers or chills,
caugh/n/v.
.
In the ED, 96.9 HR 130 BP 122/76 and 98%RA. she received 325 mg
aspirin and lopressor 5 mg IV X 3 with slowing of her heart rate
to 110s.
.
On transfer to the floor pt c/o neck pain which she states has
been bothering her for several months. She has tried tylenol
with minimal relief. Some relief with local heat and bengay.
Denies any recent trauma.
.
On review of symptoms, she denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or
red stools.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,
ankle, syncope or presyncope.

REPORTS:

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2192-5-16**] 1:11 PM
IMPRESSION:
1. Unchanged cardiomegaly, without evidence of pulmonary edema.
2. Probable small bilateral pleural effusions with bilateral
basilar atelectasis.
.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2192-5-19**] 9:34 AM
Cardiac silhouette is enlarged, and there has been development
of congestive heart failure with perihilar and basilar edema.
Bilateral moderate pleural effusions have increased in size with
adjacent atelectasis.
.
TTE: [**2192-5-21**]:
Conclusions:
The left atrium is elongated. No left atrial mass/thrombus seen
(best excluded by transesophageal echocardiography). The right
atrium is markedly dilated. The estimated right atrial pressure
is 11-15mmHg. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size
are normal. There is mild regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction with severe hypokinesis of the inferior and
inferoseptal walls. The remaining segments contract well.
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more
depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.] The
right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated. Right ventricular
systolic function is normal. [Intrinsic function may be
depressed given the severity of tricuspid regurgitation.] The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. There is no
mitral valve prolapse. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is
severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. The end-diastolic
pulmonic regurgitation velocity is increased suggesting
pulmonary artery diastolic hypertension. There is a small
pericardial effusion without hemodynamic evidence of
compromise/tamponade physiology.
.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2192-1-4**], the

inferior/inferoseptal wall motion abnormality is new, overall
LVEF is more depressed, and the severity of mitral regurgitation
has increased. The severity of pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension is also markedly increased.

Brief Hospital Course:
78 yo F with CHF (EF 50%) and a history of Afib who presented
with palpitations due to recurrent Afib.
.
#. Rhythm:
The patient presented in Afib w/RVR. There were no signs of
infection or any complaint of chest pain suggesting ischemia as
etiology for afib recurrance. Had rates 120's-130's on
admission, with stable blood pressure. Initially rate control
was attempted by increasing metoprolol to 75mg [**Hospital1 **], however pt
still had HR's in 110's. Pt was then DC cardioverted, and
remained in NSR.  She did not need a TEE prior to cardioversion,
as PCP records were [**Name9 (PRE) 97121**] and INR had largely been therapeutic
in past month. Metoprolol dose was then decreased to home dose
as pt had rate in 70's.
--pt's INR became supratherapeutic, so coumadin was held for
several days, and then re-started once INR was in acceptable
range.
--started sotalol for rhythm control, however pt had prolonging
QTc. Sotalol dose was then decreased from 80mg [**Hospital1 **] to 40mg [**Hospital1 **].
QTc was monitored while on sotalol.
.
#. Pump - EF 40%
-- given renal insufficiency on admission and dry mucous
membranes, lasix and lisinopril were held, however lasix and
lisinopril were later restarted
-- approximately 24 hours after cardioversion, pt c/o SOB and
had hypoxic respiratory failure, which was thought secondary to
post-cardioversion CHF. She required a 100% NRB, nitro gtt, and
was transferred to the CCU for BiPAP. She underwent aggressive
diuresis along with BiPAP, and SOB and O2 requirement greatly
improved. Pt now satting well on 2L NC and returned to the floor
once breathing was stable. She ruled out for MI during this
episode.
.
#. CAD:
no documented history of CAD, though inferior HK on echo
--she was contined on BB, asa
--she was not previously on statin LDL 102 [**2192-1-23**], previously
114.
