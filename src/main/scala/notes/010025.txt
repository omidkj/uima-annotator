Service: SURGERY

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1**]
Chief Complaint:
Pain, nausea, emesis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Exploratory laparotomy, Extensive lysis of adhesions, and Small
bowel resection on [**2158-3-17**]


History of Present Illness:
The patient is an 85 y/o F with PMHx significant for HTN, COPD,
and DJD, who was admitted to the surgical service on [**2158-3-14**]
with abdominal pain, nausea, and bilious emesis. She reports
that these symptoms began 5 days prior to her presentation. They
were waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] in nature. At the time of presentation,
she had not had a bowel movement in approximately 3 days.
.
On presentation to the ED, the patient had an NGT tube placed
for decompression in the setting of a suspected SBO. She was
admitted to the surgical service, where she was monitored for
several days. When her symptoms did not improve over several
days, the patient was brought to the OR for ex lap. During her
ex lap this afternoon, she was found to have a segemnt of small
bowel that was adhered to the mesh from a previous hernia
repair. She underwent resection of this segment of small bowel
as well as lysis of other adhesions. Her surgical procedure was
ultimately longer than planned (3.5 hours). She also reportedly
did not get as much fluid resuscitation as she should have
during surgery. As a result, she developed hypotension in the
intra- and post-operative period. UOP was reportedly low
(0-30/hr in the PACU). She was given albumin (32.5 gm total),
bolused 2L LR, and started on LR at 150 cc/hr. SBP was
reportedly in the 90's in the PACU (baseline in the 140's). She
is now admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for monitoring of her blood pressure
overnight.
.
On arrival to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], the patient's VS were T: 96.2 BP: 105/55
P: 91 R: 20 O2: 91% on 3LNC. She complained of abdominal pain
and nausea. She denied any chest pain or shortness of breath.
She reported that she did feel very thirsty. She denied any
other complaints. She reported that her last BM was last Sunday;
she also denied passing flatus. She described her emesis as
biliary.

[**3-14**] KUB: IMPRESSION: Findings are consistent with early small
bowel obstruction.
.
[**3-14**] CT abd/pelvis:IMPRESSION:
1. High-grade small-bowel obstruction with transition point at
the anterior
abdominal wall surgical wound, without discrete mass seen, may
be secondary to
adhesions.
2. Indetermiante splenic hypodensities, can be further evaluated
by MRI or
ultrasound.
3. 1.5 x 0.7 cm duodenal lipoma.
4. Colonic diverticulosis with no evidence of acute
diverticulitis.
5. Moderate-large hiatal hernia.

Brief Hospital Course:
85 y/o F with PMHx significant for HTN, COPD, GERD, DJD, a/w
SBO, now s/p ex-lap with bowel resection and lysis of adhesions.
Admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] from the PACU for monitoring in the setting
of post-operative hypotension.
.
# Hypotension: Likely dehydration in the setting of SBO and
recent surgery. UOP and BP responded well to fluid boluses.
Boluses were continued PRN to maintain UOP.  Her home
antihypertensive regimen was held.  No pressors were ever
needed.
.
# SBO, s/p Bowel Resection and Lysis of Adhesions: Patient
presented with abdominal pain and N/V. She was found to have an
SBO and was brought to the OR for bowel resection and LOA.
Morphine PCA for pain control.  Immediately post-operatively she
was oliguric and hypotensive requiring admission to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].
It was determined that this was secondary to inadequate fluid
resuscitation.  She responded appropriately to fluid
resuscitation.  She was admitted to the floor.  She did have an
ileus which resolved.  She was started on cipro/flagyl for
empiric coverage of bowel sources of infection which was
completed after a 7 day course.  By the time of discharge she
was tolerating regular diet and her pain was controlled on PO
meds.
.
# COPD: She is not on home oxygen. Her home respiratory
medications include albuterol, symbicort, and theophylline.  She
was continued on albuterol.  Advair was started to replace
symbicort while in house.  Theophylline was also on hold and
would likely be restarted.
.
# UTI: Urine culture was growing E.coli sensitive to cipro.  She
was continued on cipro.
.
# H/o Hypertension: On amlodipine/benazepril, atenolol, and
furosemide at home.  Holding home antihypertensive and ASA
regimen for now given hypotension and recent surgery.

#DVT: [**2158-3-23**] pt found to have unilateral RUE swelling.
Underwent RUE US which demosntrated extensive DVT extending from
the subclavian to the basilic vein.  She was started on coumadin
for anticoagulation on [**2158-3-24**].  INR was monitored and dose
adjusted appopriately.  She will need follow up with her Primary
care provider and coumadin clinic for continued treatment.
.
# Hyperlipidemia: Home lovastatin on hold, likely restart on
discharge.
.
# Psych: Patient was reportedly on alprazolam, oxazepam, and
sertraline at home. These meds have been on hold while patient
in house and can likely be restarted on discharge.
.
#. GERD- Continued home PPI.
