Admission Date:  [**2102-5-12**]     Discharge Date:  [**2102-5-16**]

Date of Birth:   [**2039-3-10**]     Sex:  M

Service:  MICU

He was originally on the MICU service and then transferred to
the [**Hospital1 **] Medicine service.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a patient well known to
me as I discharged him last week.  Please refer to the
previous discharge summary from [**2102-5-11**] for additional
past medical history details.

Basically, this is a patient who is 63 years old with a
history of COPD on 4 liters of oxygen at home and multiple
recent admissions for COPD flares.  He reports the day after
being discharged from his last hospitalization, the patient
experienced increased respiratory distress and called EMS.
He reports on this day that he woke up, and having trouble
breathing, became confused, and was unable to take his
prednisone that day or any of his inhalers.  He called EMS
with his Life Line system.

In the field, the patient was hypertensive, tachycardic,
tachypneic, and hypoxic at 92% on nonrebreather.  In the ED,
the patient was intubated and started on propofol, which
resulted in hypotension.  He was given several liters of
fluid, Solu-Medrol, and propofol changed to Ativan drip and
hypotension responded and improved.  While in the Medical
Intensive Care Unit, a CTA was performed and was negative for
PE or pneumonia.  The patient was extubated on [**5-14**], and
was changed to p.o. prednisone on [**5-15**].  Additionally, he
was ruled out for myocardial infarction during this time.

Additional history:  He reports no fevers, no chills.  Does
have a cough with some white sputum, but no chest pain,
abdominal pain, diarrhea, or rash.  No PND.  He sleeps on two
pillows, which has been unchanged for many years.  No lower
extremity edema.

As far as risk factors for COPD flare, his wife does [**Name2 (NI) **]
candles inside the house, which can cause poor air quality
and in addition he has shagged carpet as well.  He is also on
metoprolol, a beta-blocker, which may be aggravating his
symptoms.  He nor his wife smoke.  They have no pets, and
there are no foods that he knows that aggravate his
allergies.

Upon my exam once he was admitted to the floor after his MICU
course, his temperature was 97.2, blood pressure 148/72,
heart rate 90, respirations 22.  He was 97% on 5 liters nasal
cannula, which is his baseline.  In general, he is in no
acute distress, sitting up in bed, talking in complete
sentences.  HEENT:  Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to
light.  Clear oropharynx, no lymphadenopathy, no thyromegaly.
Chest:  Poor air movement throughout, but no wheezes or
rales.  Cardiovascular:  Distant heart sounds, but regular,
rate, and rhythm, no murmurs.  Abdomen was soft, nontender,
nondistended, positive bowel sounds.  Extremities:  No edema.
Dorsalis pedis and radial pulses 2+ bilaterally.  Neurologic:
Strength is [**5-10**] in all extremities and sensation to light
touch and cold were intact bilaterally.  He was alert and
oriented times three.  Cranial nerves II through XII are
intact.  Deep tendon reflexes 2+ throughout.  No focal
neurological deficits.

LABORATORIES:  His white count was 18 upon admission, nadired
down to 10 and was 15 on the day I was seeing him.
Hematocrit 34, platelets 237 with a MCV of 87.  Chemistries
essentially within normal limits.  CKs and troponins were
checked and were negative x3.  Blood cultures from [**5-12**]
showing no growth to date.  Urine culture from the 7th
showing no growth.

He had a CTA of the chest during this hospitalization, which
showed extensive bilateral emphysematous changes.  No
pulmonary embolus.  Enlarged pulmonary arteries to suggest
pulmonary hypertension and a small amount of basilar
atelectasis.

In summary, this is a 63-year-old male with a history of COPD
on home O2 status post multiple admissions for COPD flares,
now status post intubation for respiratory distress.  No PE,
no pneumonia, only emphysema and pulmonary hypertension seen
on CTA.  Thought this episode of respiratory distress was
thought to be secondary to COPD flare.  He was currently
extubated and doing well on p.o. prednisone, but still with
poor air movement on exam.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. COPD exacerbation:  Status post extubation yesterday,
doing well, ambulating, speaking in full sentences.  The
patient ambulated with Physical Therapy on 4 liters of nasal
cannula and ambulation of 350 feet.  He desaturated to 88%.
He was transitioned to p.o. prednisone and is on 60 mg a day.
He should stay on this current dose with a very slow taper as
his COPD flares appear to be quite dependent on prednisone.
He has an appointment with his outpatient pulmonologist, Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 575**] for three days from now on [**5-19**].  Taper is to
be determined by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 575**].  He was continued on his
albuterol and Atrovent MDIs with prn nebulizers.  He has a
nebulizer machine at home.  He is also on Flovent as well.
He was continued on oxygen and also maintained on a
proton-pump inhibitor to eliminate reflux, which may cause
bronchospasm.

An inspiration spirometer was placed at bedside for
atelectasis.  Additionally, I went over his previous
pulmonary function tests and they are consistent with
emphysema with only moderate changes bronchodilators.

2. Steroid use:  He was maintained on fingersticks q.i.d.
with regular insulin-sliding scale.  He may need to have an
oral hyperglycemic [**Doctor Last Name 360**] added to his regimen by his primary
care doctor if he continues to be maintained on steroids that
cause hyperglycemia.  He was also on calcium, vitamin D, and
a proton-pump inhibitor for prophylaxis for his steroid use.

3. History of back pain:  He is status post laminectomy 26
years ago.  His neuro exam is nonfocal.  He is very strong,
and he was given prn Percocet.

4. Hypertension:  He is on a beta-blocker and ACE inhibitor.
The beta-blocker may worsen bronchospasm, but it is a good
drug for him given his history of myocardial infarction.

5. CAD:  He is continued on aspirin, ACE inhibitor, and
beta-blocker.  He tolerated the beta-blocker well while in
house with no further episodes of respiratory distress.

6. FEN:  Diabetic heart-healthy diet.

7. Prophylaxis:  SubQ Heparin t.i.d.  PPI and Colace.

8. Code:  He is full code.

9. Disposition:  To home with services.  He already has home
O2 setup.  He has no need for pulmonary rehab given his
excellent ambulation.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease flare.
2. Hypertension.
3. Hypercholesterolemia.
4. Coronary artery disease.
5. Steroid-induced hyperglycemia.
6. Chronic back pain, no neurological deficits.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  To home with VNA services.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Good.  Stable.

pulmonary breathing tests on [**5-19**], Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] of
Cardiac services on [**5-23**] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 8499**], his PCP.
[**Name10 (NameIs) **] should call to make an appointment.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1. Albuterol/ipratropium MDI two puffs q.6h.
2. Fluticasone two puffs b.i.d.
3. Atorvastatin 10 mg once a day.
