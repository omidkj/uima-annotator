diagnostic paracentesis


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 3234**] is a 42 y.o. M with AIDS (CD4 65 on [**2119-10-31**]),
hepatitis C cirrhosis, recently discharged on [**10-14**] after a five
day admission for abdominal pain, worsening ascites, jaundice
and diarrhea, now presents with fever, and abdominal pain.
.
During his prior admission from [**Date range (1) 32802**], he presented with
abdominal pain, worsening ascites, jaundice, and diarrhea. CT
scan on admission showed ?colitis. Stool cultures and CMV were
negative. He underwent EGD and colonoscopy which were
unrevealing. Biopsies were negative. He underwent therapeutic
paracentesis, removing 3.2 liters of ascites. He was started on
immodium for diarrhea, lasix, and aldactone.
.
The patient mentions that 1 week ago he started having diarrhea
with dark stools. About 3 days ago, he had worsening abdominal
pain and chills. He has been having [**3-8**] bowel movements per day,
which is more than usual even with taking lactulose and
rifaximin. He has had poor po intake over the past 3 days
secondary to nausea and vomiting. Emesis has been non bloody,
non bilious. Patient denies any cough, shortness of breath, or
chest pain. No BRBPR. No dysuria. He does not believe his
abdomen is larger than baseline.
.
.
In the ED, initial VS: 98.2, 63, 81/41, 20, 100%. He was found
to have diffuse abdominal tenderness, and brown, guaiac positive
stool. Abdominal paracentesis was attempted twice, however was
stopped due to bleeding. Given INR of 3.3, further attempts were
not pursued. He received levofloxacin 750 mg, vancomycin 1 g
empirically for community acquired pneumonia, with flagyl for
abdominal coverage, and bactrim. He also received Pantoprazole
40mg x1. CT abdomen/pelvis revealed colitis. He received 2L IV
fluids. On transfer, vital signs were HR 56 BP 97/43 RR 23 100%
on RA.
.
On evaluation in the ICU, the patient has some mild abdominal
pain and weakness, but no other complaints.
.
ROS: Denies night sweats, headache, vision changes, rhinorrhea,
congestion, sore throat, cough, shortness of breath, chest pain,
abdominal pain, nausea, constipation, BRBPR, hematochezia,
dysuria, hematuria.

[**11-6**] CT abd/pelvis
1. Diffuse bowel wall thickening of the ascending and transverse
colon,
appearing similar to CT from [**10-10**]. While liver failure
may contribute
to this appearance, infectious/inflammatory colitis cannot be
excluded.
2. Cirrhosis with large volume ascites.
2. Hematocrit level in the pelvic ascites suggests a component
of blood in the fluid - possibly secondary to traumatic
paracentesis?
.
[**11-10**] CXR
FINDINGS: There has been interval clearing of the airspace
opacity in the
right lower lung with stable airspace opacities in the right
upper lung and unchanged left retrocardiac atelectasis.
Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged and normal. Position
of the left internal jugular central venous line tip is at the
cavoatrial junction. No pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
IMPRESSION:
Interval improvement with clearing of the right lower lung;
stable airspace opacities in the right upper lobe most likely
pneumonia.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 3234**] is a 42 year old man with AIDS and HCV with
decompensated cirrhosis who presented on [**11-6**] with fevers and
abdominal pain with hypotension requiring ICU admission.
.
* Goal of care
Given the patient's end stage liver disease and advanced AIDS,
the palliative care service was consulted. In discussion with
the patient and his family the decision was reached to make him
DNR/DNI and comfort measures only. He will be treated with
anxiolytics and pain medications as needed.
.
* Hypotension
Likely due to volume depletion and possible sepsis. Improved
with IVF resuscitation and antibiotics.
.
* Fever, possible SBP
Patient underwent a therapeutic paracentesis complicated by
bleeding (Hct 8%). A component of SBP could not be absolutely
excluded therefore he was treated empirically with ceftriaxone.
CMV assay showed detectable virus, but at a very low level (<600
copies, below limits of assay to quantify) and was felt to most
likely be a false positive.
.
* AIDS
Patient had supressed viral load, with poor immunologic
recovery. After being made CMO, his antiretrovirals and
prophylactic antimicrobials were discontinued.
.
* HCV cirrhosis
He was continued on lactulose and rifaximin for management of
encephalopathy. Once made CMO, his nadolol was discontinued. He
may undergo therapeutic paracentesis if required for symptomatic
relief with his large ascites.
.
* Acute renal failure
Likely pre-renal on presentation, with ATN in setting of
hypotension. With his tense ascites abdominal compartment
syndrome was a consideration, as was hepatorenal syndrome given
possible SBP. Further workup was deferred once he was made CMO.
