Service:  CME


HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 67-year-old
male patient with a history of diabetes mellitus and
hypertension who presented with progressive shortness of
breath.

The patient states that he has had several weeks of upper
respiratory tract infection symptoms - including a cough and
runny nose - in addition to progressive shortness of breath
that has been treated unsuccessfully with three courses of
azithromycin over the Winter.

He subsequently developed orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal
dyspnea, and edema and was evaluated by a cardiologist in
[**Location 15289**] in [**2155-3-22**].  At that time, the patient
had an echocardiogram that showed an ejection fraction of 15
percent.  The patient was subsequently evaluated by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] who recommended a cardiac catheterization to rule out
coronary artery disease.  The patient presented for an
elective cardiac catheterization today which was significant
for no coronary artery disease, but there were elevated
filling pressures.  The patient was subsequently admitted to
the Coronary Care Unit Service for Swan-directed therapy.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Type 2 diabetes mellitus.

Hypertension.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1. Digoxin 0.125 mg by mouth once per day.
2. Lasix 20 mg by mouth once per day.
3. Lisinopril 10 mg by mouth once per day.
4. Potassium chloride 10 mEq by mouth every day.
5. Toprol-XL 25 mg by mouth once per day.

8. Aspirin 325 mg by mouth once per day.


SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is currently married and has one
daughter.  [**Name (NI) **] endorses a 16-pack-year history, but quit
smoking.  He reports only occasional alcohol use.

FAMILY HISTORY:  The patient's family history is significant
for coronary artery disease, diabetes mellitus, Crohn's
disease, and abdominal aortic aneurysm.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  The patient was
afebrile, his blood pressure was 138/85, his heart rate was
113, his respiratory rate was 19, and 96 percent on room air.
In general,  a well-appearing male lying in bed at 45 degrees
in no acute distress.  Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat
examination revealed the pupils were equal, round, and
reactive to light.  The extraocular movements were intact.
The patient had dry mucous membranes.  The oropharynx was
clear.  Neck revealed jugular venous pressure was at the
angle of the jaw.  There was no thyromegaly.  The lungs were
clear to auscultation bilaterally.  Cardiovascular
examination revealed the patient was tachycardic with a
regular rhythm and s3 gallop.  Normal first and second heart
sounds. There were no rubs.  There was a [**1-25**] holosystolic murmur
at the left lower sternal border and at the apex.  The abdomen
was soft, nontender, and nondistended.  There were normal active
bowel sounds.  Extremities revealed the patient had an Angio-
Seal present in his right groin.  He had 2 plus dorsalis
pedis and posterior tibial pulses bilaterally with no lower
extremity edema.

PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:  White blood
cell count was 9, his hematocrit was 42, and his platelets
were 258.  Sodium was 141, potassium was 4.5, chloride was
99, bicarbonate was 28, blood urea nitrogen was 25,
creatinine was 1.2, and blood glucose was 130.  Aspartate
aminotransferase was 14, his alanine-aminotransferase was 20,
his alkaline phosphatase was 82, his total bilirubin was 1.
His albumin was 4.2.  His hemoglobin A1C was 7.7 percent.
Thyroid stimulating hormone was 1.5.  Cholesterol was 151,
his triglycerides were 210, his high-density lipoprotein was
29, and his low-density lipoprotein was 80.

PERTINENT RADIOLOGY-IMAGING:  An echocardiogram - in [**2155-3-22**] - revealed an ejection fraction of 15 percent, 3 to 4
plus mitral regurgitation and tricuspid regurgitation.

Cardiac catheterization - on [**2155-5-8**] - revealed no
evidence of coronary artery disease other than a 70 percent
stenosis and a very small diagonal branch.  The patient's
hemodynamics revealed an right atrial pressure of 15, a right
ventricular pressure of 60/11, a pulmonary artery pressure of
60/35, and a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 35.
Cardiac output was 3.41.  Cardiac index was 1.57.

An electrocardiogram revealed a normal sinus rhythm at 105
beats per minute, left axis deviation, borderline left
ventricular hypertrophy, and several premature ventricular
contractions.

SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE ISSUES:  The patient was admitted
   for a diagnostic cardiac catheterization given a new
   diagnosis of congestive heart failure.  The patient's
   cardiac catheterization on admission was negative for
   coronary artery disease but was significant for elevated
   filling pressures.  The patient was therefore admitted to
   the Coronary Care Unit Service for directed therapy of his
   congestive heart failure.

The patient was initiated on a nesiritide drip which was
titrated up for improved urine output.  The patient diuresed
effectively with Natrecor and several boluses of intravenous
Lasix.  The patient's fluid status improved dramatically
after his first hospital day, and his Swan-Ganz catheter was
discontinued.  The patient was continued on nesiritide for
three days until it was titrated down and off.  The patient's
Lasix dose was increased prior to discharge.  The patient was
continued on an ACE inhibitor and beta blocker, the doses of
which were titrated up as tolerated by the patient's blood
pressure and heart rate.

The etiology of the patient's congestive heart failure was
not entirely clear given his normal cardiac catheterization.
The patient had a thyroid stimulating hormone drawn which was
normal.  Given the patient's upper respiratory tract
infection symptoms, it was possible that there was a viral
etiology to the patient's heart failure; however, the patient
also has a longstanding history of hypertension which may
ultimately be the cause.

1. CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE ISSUES:  The patient had no
   evidence of coronary artery disease on cardiac
   catheterization.  He was continued on a low dose of
   aspirin in addition to an ACE inhibitor and beta blocker,
   the doses of which were titrated up as tolerated by his
   heart rate and blood pressure.  The patient had no
   complaints of chest pain throughout his brief
   hospitalization.

1. DIABETES MELLITUS ISSUES:  The patient's metformin was
   held on admission given the concern for lactic acidosis.
   The patient was continued on his glipizide and had
   relatively good control of his blood sugars throughout his
   hospitalization.  The [**Hospital **] Clinic was contact[**Name (NI) **] and
   consulted.  They recommended continuing the present
   regimen with glipizide and believed that the patient's
   blood sugars would improve once he was discharged and
   exercising more.  Although they were happy to follow the
   patient as an outpatient, they noted that he had a good
   relationship with an endocrinologist who has been
   apparently treating the patient's diabetes for the last
   several years.


CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Good.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  The patient was discharged to home with
close followup.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:  Congestive heart failure/systolic
dysfunction.

Moderate/severe mitral valve regurgitation and tricuspid
valve regurgitation.

Type 2 diabetes mellitus.

Hypertension.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
1. Aspirin 81 mg by mouth once per day.
2. Digoxin 0.25 mg by mouth once per day.
3. Glipizide 10 mg by mouth once per day.
4. Lisinopril 30 mg by mouth once per day.
5. Metoprolol succinate sustain release 75 mg by mouth once
   per day.
6. Lasix 40 mg by mouth once per day.


DISCHARGE FOLLOW UP:  The patient was encouraged to follow up
with his primary care physician in one to two weeks.  The
patient was also encouraged to follow up with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [
