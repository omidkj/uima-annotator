Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2297**]
Chief Complaint:
hepatic encephalopathy

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Central venous line placement
CVVH
Paracentesis

History of Present Illness:
This is a 47yoF with HCV Cirrhosis and hypertension who was
transferred from an OSH for further evaluation of hepatic
encephalopathy.
At the OSH([**Date range (1) 71225**]), she was admitted for hepatic
encephalopathy and hypovolemia was treated w/IVF initially then
w/lactulose and rifaximin and had [**2-27**] BMs per day w/o
improvement in her MS per report. She was afebrile, guiac
negative but found to be anemic(HCT 25) upon admission and was
transfused 2 units PRBCs.  The following studies and treatments
were performed:
[**3-15**] EGD: portal gastropathy, no varices
[**3-18**] CT head negative;
[**3-17**] CT abdomen/pelvis: large ascites w/o significant change
from [**10-1**], punctate nonobstructive calculous in lower pole of
left kidney
She was found to have a dirty u/a and was treated w/levofloxacin
from [**Date range (1) 11505**] for UTI though Urine and blood cx were negative;
She had a therapeutic and diagnostic paracentesis performed on
[**3-13**] which was negative for SBP.
Because of her acute on chronic renal failure as well as
hypercalcemia she was worked up for multiple myeloma as well as
other etiologies of hypercalcemia including: PTH normal, kappa
light chain and bence [**Doctor Last Name 49**] proteins negative, whole body bone
scan negative. Improved w/IVF hydration and was normalizing on
transfer.
.
Upon arrival to the floor, she is responsive to verbal stimuli
but lethargic. She is unable to give hx or answer questions for
ROS.

Past Medical History:
Hepatitis C/Cirrhosis
-treated in [**2166**] for a year with interferon and Ribavirin
-retreated three years later with pegylated interferon and
Ribavirin for six months stopped due to intolerance which
included mental status changes and passing out.
- developed ascites in [**2176**] and had some encephalopathy at that
time although she also started her psychiatric medications then,
(which she continues on now with less mental status changes).
-She was initially referred to [**Hospital3 2358**] for transplantation,
but was denied this secondary to high body mass index and low
MELD score.
.
PMH:
HTN
Asthma
Depression

Social History:
Lives in [**Hospital1 189**] by herself but her daughter and husband visit
often.
Smoked 2.5-3 packs per day x 25yrs but quit one week ago by
tapering down.
No current EtOH (social drinker until 2yrs ago)


Family History:
Father and uncle with cirrhosis.  Also cirrhosis and thyroid
disease.

Studies:
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2179-3-22**]
New consolidation in the infrahilar right lung is suspicious for
pneumonia. A similar abnormality on the left was present earlier
in the day and could be pneumonia or atelectasis. There is no
pleural effusion. Heart size top normal, has increased
suggesting volume overload though there is no pulmonary edema.
.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2179-3-22**]
IMPRESSION:
1. No intracranial hemorrhage.
2. Unchanged age-inappropriate global atrophy, likely related to
underlying liver disease.
3. Complete opacification of the left maxillary sinus, worsened
since previous exam.
.
DUPLEX DOPP ABD/PEL  [**2179-3-22**]
IMPRESSION:
1. Cirrhotic-appearing liver with no focal masses.
2. Patent hepatic vasculature.
3. Massive ascites. The left lower quadrant was marked for
paracentesis to be performed by the clinical staff.
4. Splenomegaly.
.
CT ABDOMEN W/O CONTRAST  [**2179-3-23**]
IMPRESSION:
1. Though somewhat limited, there is no evidence of
intra-abdominal infection.
2. Significant ascites seen within the peritoneal cavity.
3. Shrunken, cirrhotic-appearing liver.
4. Patchy airspace opacities identified at the lung bases
bilaterally. This may represent pneumonia and clinical
correlation is recommended.
.
RENAL U.S.  [**2179-3-23**]
IMPRESSION:
1. Normal kidneys.
2. Large amount of intra-abdominal ascites.
.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2179-3-31**]
IMPRESSION:
1. Worsening pulmonary edema secondary to volume overload.
2. New right IJ and an advanced feeding tube are in satisfactory
location.
3. The heart size is top normal.

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient was a 47yo F with HCV Cirrhosis and hypertension who was
transferred from an OSH for further evaluation of hepatic
encephalopathy.  She was admited to the Hepatorenal service.
She underwent a paracentesis and was found to have SBP.
Peritoneal fluid grew ESBL E. coli, and she was started on
meropenam.  Her urine cx also grew ESBL E. coli.  She was also
thought to have pneumonia and was started on vancomycin.  For
her diarrhea and concern of C. diff, she was started on
metronidazole.
.
In addition, her creatinine began to trend up and she was
started on octreotide and midodrine.  She then became ogliuric.
On [**3-27**], her respiratory status acutely worsened; this was felt
to be due to pulmonary edema and she did not respond to Lasix.
She was transferred to the MICU.
.
In the MICU, she was intubated and placed on mechanical
ventilation.  She met criteria for ARDS and was ventilated per
ARDS net protocol.  She was also started on levophed and
vasopressin for shock, which was likely multifactorial,
including sepsis initially and then cardiogenic during runs of
atrial fibrilation with RVR.  For her acute renal
failure/anuria, octreotide and midodrine were discontinued and
she was initiated on CVVH for purposes of volume removal.
However, it was difficult to balance fluid removal with
worsening hypotension.  Given the severity of the liver disease
and other comorbidities, CVVH was felt to be a means to no end
and was discontinued.  Given the extremely poor prognosis of the
patient, there were multiple family discussions.  Social work
was also involved.  Pt was first made DNR on [**3-30**] and then no
escalation of care on [**3-31**].  She went into ventricular
tachycardia on [**4-3**] followed by asystole.  She expired on [**4-3**].
HCP was notified.  Autopsy was declined.
