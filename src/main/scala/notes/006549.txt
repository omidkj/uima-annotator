Brief Hospital Course:
45 yo M, with new diagnosis of HIV ([**2173-12-28**] with CD4 200, VL
5.8mil) who is 5 days s/p discharge from OSH on
bactrim/prednisone for PCP PNA presents with bloody diarrhea,
transferred to the ICU for respiratory distress.
.
#. Respiratory distress. On [**1-13**] his oxygen requirement
increased from 3L to 5L. A repeat chest X-ray showed no
significant changes. Induced sputum was attempted but sample was
inadequate. He was stable through [**1-14**] with shortness of breath
with minimal exertion. At 5am on the morning of transfer, he was
noted to be tachypneic in the 30's with a sat of 78% on 4L. He
was transitioned to a NRB mask, and his oxygen saturation
improved to 89%. ABG at that time was 7.54/23/52/20, and he was
transferred to the MICU for worsening hypoxia. He was intubated
on arrival to the MICU. Thought to be worsening PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. CMV
pneumonia vs. superinfection, although bronchoscopy revealed
only PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) **] the next several days, his ventilatory
requirements increased and he was proned for increased V/Q
matching. After a meeting with the family, care was withdrawn,
and the patient expired soon thereafter.
.
#. Bloody diarrhea - Found to have CMV colitis on sigmoidoscopy
with biopsies. Started on ganciclovir, which was continued on
transfer to the MICU given concern for systemic CMV
infection/CMV pneumonitis.
