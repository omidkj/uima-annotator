Service:  NEURO MED

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 39-year-old
female with no significant past medical history who presented
with headache, vomiting and loss of consciousness.  On the
day of admission the patient complained of the sudden onset
of headache followed by vomiting and then followed shortly
thereafter by loss of consciousness.  She was taken to an
outside hospital where a head CT showed intercerebral
hemorrhage.  The patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 346**].

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
Obesity.

MEDICATIONS:
None.

ALLERGIES:
No known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is married with several
children.

FAMILY HISTORY:  There is no known family history of stroke.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:
VITAL SIGNS:  Blood pressure 140/90.  Pulse 70.  Respiratory
rate 18.
GENERAL:  The patient was intubated.
NECK:  Supple.
LUNGS:  There were decreased lung sounds on the right.
HEART:  Showed regular rate and rhythm.
MENTAL STATUS:  The patient was intubated but not sedated and
still had no response to verbal or tactile stimulation.
CRANIAL NERVE:  There is no blink to threat.  Her right pupil
is 4 mm and minimally reactive.  Her left pupil is 4 mm
minimally reactive.  Corneal reflexes are active.  Motor
testing there is decreased tone throughout.  There was no
spontaneous movements.  On noxious stimulation she had
extensor posturing.  Reflexes were decreased throughout.
Toes are upgoing bilaterally.

LABORATORY DATA:
Head CT on arrival showed a right posterior fossa bleed with
the epicenter at the cerebellar pontine angle involving the
pons, the medulla and right cerebellum.  There was mass
effect on the fourth ventricle with no evidence of
hydrocephalus.  There is no shift of midline structures.

The patient was admitted to the Neurologic Intensive Care
Unit.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  Neurology:  The stroke service met with the
family to discuss that there was a very poor
neurologic prognosis.  The patient's family wanted all
measures to be taken.  The patient was evaluated by
Neurosurgery and felt there was no surgical intervention
indication.  She was started on Mannitol to decrease any
intracranial pressure as well as she was hyperventilated to a
goal of PCO2 of approximately 25.  The Mannitol and
hyperventilation were continued for several days without any
significant change in her exam.  Serial head CT's were
obtained.  The most recent head CT was on [**2-1**] which
showed extensive cerebellar and brain stem hemorrhage with
surrounding edema.  There was effacement of the basal
cisterns.  There was no hydrocephalus.  The patient's
neurologic exam has remained essentially the same.
2.  Cardiovascular:  The patient was initially on a Nipride
drip and at times also on a Labetalol drip.  Initially, her
blood pressure goal was less than 130 and this was gradually
liberated to goal of less than 140.  She was converted to
oral hypertensives in the form of Lopressor and Hydralazine.
3.  Respiratory:  The patient was intubated by EMS.  She
remains intubated on the ventilator.  She was initially on
assist control and has recently transitioned to CPAP with
pressures aport.  Plan is for a tracheostomy to be placed.
4.  Fluid, electrolytes and nutrition:  The patient was
initially on intravenous fluids.  An nasogastric tube was
placed and she was started on nasogastric tube feeds.  The
plan is for percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy placement.
5.  The patient was on gut protection with Pepcid.
6.  Hematologic:  The patient's hematocrit was consistently
low, most likely a combination of the intracerebral
hemorrhage, iron deficiency and her menses.  The patient
given transfusions as needed to maintain a goal hematocrit of
approximately 30.
7.  Infectious Disease:  The patient was intermittently
febrile and cultured as clinically indicated.  Sputum
cultures grew staph aureus and the patient was started on
Vancomycin.  She is continuing on a course of Vancomycin with
a plan for 10 day course.  Urine cultures also grew
klebsiella pneumoniae which were pan sensitive.  She is
currently on Levofloxacin with a plan of a seven day course.
8.  Code Status:  The patient remains a full code.  The
family desires percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy and
tracheostomy placement which will be performed this week.

DIAGNOSES:
1.  Pontine cerebellar hemorrhage.
2.  Hypertension.
3.  Anemia.
4.  Pneumonia.
5.  Urinary tract infection.
