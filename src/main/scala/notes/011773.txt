HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 56 year old
male, with poorly controlled diabetes; history of chronic
neck pain and right first metatarsal diabetic ulcer. He was
treated with a seven day course of Augmentin from [**12-22**]
to [**12-29**].  He has been followed by podiatry who felt
the ulcer was improving clinically.

On the evening of [**2-9**], the patient developed fever and
chills.  On [**2-10**], he developed acute onset of right shoulder
pain that was worse with movement.  He did not notice that it
was warm. There was no rash or swelling. He was seen at an
outside clinic where he was febrile to 102.2.  He had a
leukocytosis to 15,000 with 91% polys and a thrombocytopenia
to 91 and a sodium of 129.  His shoulder film at that time
was negative.

He was referred to [**Hospital1 69**] where
an acute shoulder film was negative.  Initially, he was
afebrile and hemodynamically stable.  At 1 a.m., he developed
tachycardia and hypotension to 89/60 with an oxygen
saturation of 88% on room air.  He became increasing
tachycardiac but blood pressure stabilized with four liters
of normal saline and saturations improved with three liters
of oxygen.

In the Emergency Department, an aspiration of his shoulder
was attempted by the emergency department and by orthopedics,
unsuccessfully.  He then developed abdominal pain and
distention.  A KUB and CT were negative.

Surgery evaluated him and felt that his abdomen was not
surgical.  At that point, he was started on Ceftriaxone and
Flagyl.  At the time of the Medical Intensive Care Unit
evaluation, he was complaining of shoulder and neck pain.  He
had several months of abdominal pain but denied chest pain,
shortness of breath, nausea, vomiting or headache.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia
and chronic neck pain.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS:
Insulin.
Naprosyn.
Motrin.
Augmentin.
Lipitor.
Lisinopril.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  No alcohol, tobacco or intravenous drug use.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Noncontributory.

LABORATORY DATA:  Initial laboratory studies showed a white
count of 11.2 and hematocrit of 30.2; platelets 109.  Sodium
of 132; potassium of 3.7; chloride 102; bicarbonate 21; BUN
23; creatinine 1.0; glucose 274.  CK's were 235 and 436 with
negative MB's and negative Treponin.  The calcium was 7.4;
magnesium 1.4; phosphorus 1.9; TSH was 1.1.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Orthopedic.  The patient was admitted to
the Medical Intensive Care Unit with a septic shoulder.  He
had two attempts at aspiration of the joint in the Emergency
Room which were unsuccessful. He then received operative
arthrocentesis which was significant for withdraw of 5 cc of
purulent fluid, which subsequently grew group A strep.

In addition, blood cultures at that time were also positive
for group A strep. The joint was washed out and the patient
was started on intravenous penicillin and clindamycin and
IVIG. Following this wash-out, the patient continued to have
significant right shoulder pain.  Reimaging by magnetic
resonance scan, showed that there was still a fluid
collection with significant soft tissue swelling.  He
received another joint tap by ortho which was significant
only for yellow colored fluid which had no organisms and
cultures were negative by the date of this dictation.

He was seen by physical therapy and he made gradual
improvement in the motion of his arm.  Of note, the magnetic
resonance scan had a slight suggestion that there might be
osteomyelitis of the clavicle.  Also, on the day the patient
was sent out of the Medical Intensive Care Unit, it was noted
that he had extreme swelling of his right arm and that it was
also difficult to move the elbow. He received a Doppler study
of the right arm which was negative for deep vein thrombosis
and a plain film of the right elbow, which also showed that
there was no effusion.

Foot ulcer:  The patient was followed by podiatry for his
right foot ulcer, which was likely the source of his group A
strep bacteremia.  They could not probe to bone.  He had a
magnetic resonance scan of the foot which showed no
osteomyelitis and likely no fluid collections that would be
amenable to drainage.  Continue dressing changes and
antibiotics.

Infectious disease:  Patient with Group A strep bacteremia.
He is to receive a total of four weeks of penicillin and an
additional two weeks of clindamycin.  His Clindamycin was
initially stopped when he was afebrile coming on the Neonatal
Intensive Care Unit.  Since he began having fevers again, it
was restarted and it was thought that he would have a total
of a two week course.  He was also given a five day course of
IVIG since there was evidence that there was a better outcome
for group A strep bacteremia and toxic shock with IVIG.

Orchitis.  The patient had some testicular pain while in the
Medical Intensive Care Unit, although this is chronic.  It is
probably aggravated by failure.

He received an ultrasound which was significant for bilateral
epididymitis and possible bilateral orchitis.  Urology was
consulted and it was decided that he would begin
Ciprofloxacin for likely a three week course and then to
re-evaluate how he was doing.

Cardiovascular:  Patient with an episode of congestive heart
failure in the context of aggressive volume repletion in the
operating room.  He autodiuresed and his oxygen requirement
resolved.

Hypertension:  The patient's hypertensive medications were on
hold in the setting of sepsis and were not restarted at the
time of discharge.

Diabetes:  Insulin dependent diabetes mellitus that had been
well controlled throughout most of the admission.

Hypocortisol:  Patient with borderline cortisol stimulation
test.  On re-evaluation, he did not require corticosteroids
and had a negative test.

Fluids, electrolytes and nutrition:  The patient was
hyponatremic throughout some of the admission, likely
secondary to his autodiuresis and Lasix.

Access:  The patient received a left PICC line to receive his
intravenous antibiotics prophylaxis.  He was on H2 blocker
and subcutaneous heparin throughout the admission.

Anemia:  Patient with a hematocrit of 26 which was stable,
although he will need an outpatient colonoscopy.

On the day of discharge, the patient had been afebrile for 24
hours and had marked improvement in his shoulder pain.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
Insulin 40 units NPH in the morning, 16 at night.
Clindamycin 450 mg p.o. q. six hours until [**3-3**].
