History of Present Illness:
52M ho testicular CA, Ulcerative colitis, recently admitted to
the OSH ICU for necrotizing pna x 5 days, did not require
intubation but was on non-rebreather, who was discharged 2 days
ago and since then has been having worsening dyspnea, malaise,
SOB, fever 101.8. Pt initialy reported to [**Hospital6 **]
ED and then transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] ED.
.
In detail, pt reports 1 mo he had emesis and felt feverish,
sluggish, malaise. The following week he had chest pain down his
right side that reminded him of his prior stone in the common
bile duct in [**2166**]. He saw a Gi doctor who considered biliary
colic. Following day he felt worse and had fever and reported to
OSH hospital where he was diagnosied with a pneumonia and
treated initialy with clinda and then switched to 4 days of
zosyn and vanco. Received total of 5 days of levoflox. CTA was
negative for PE but did reveal necrotizing pna in RUL, pna in
RLL and LLL, right sided effusion (this is all per wife who is
RN). He was put on non-rebreather to maintain sats in 90s.
He was discharged 2 days ago and felt a little better. Today he
felt worse, recurrent pleuritic CP, fevers and reported to OSH.
.
While at [**Hospital3 **] ED he was given zofran for some nausea and
then sent to [**Hospital1 18**] ED.
.
In the ED, initial VS were: 90% RA, 139/83, RR 30, 91 HR, T 98.4
Triggered for requiring 6L NC for sat in low 90s, RR 30s.
Access 18g
Given morphine, albuterol neb, ipratropium neb, zofran, zosyn
4.5g and plans to give Vanco. Given 1 L NS.
Blood cx drawns.
Labs: lactate 0.9, WBC 14, HCT 40, PLT 599.
CXR:RML and RLL opacity and effusion
Transfer vitals: 94% on 6L NC, 132/71, RR 22, HR 87, T 98.4
Pt transfered to MICU for resp distress in setting of pneumonia.
.
On arrival to the MICU, pt is comfortable but diapharetic.
Denies any dyspnea or cough. ROS positive for 16 Ib weight loss
since pna, night sweats for a few weeks, no cough whatsoever.
Has intermitten diarrhea from UC but has been having more
episodes in setting of antibiotics lately. Some blood in stool.

CXR ([**2169-4-27**]):
Moderate cardiomegaly, new since [**2166**], with large right and
small
left pleural effusions, central vascular congestion, and mild
interstitial
edema, concerning for cardiac decompensation.
.
TTE ([**2169-4-28**]):
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are
normal (LVEF >55%). The estimated cardiac index is normal
(>=2.5L/min/m2). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal left
ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic root is
mildly dilated at the sinus level. The ascending aorta is
moderately dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic
stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is mild-moderate pulmonary artery hypertension. There is a
small to moderate sized pericardial effusion anterior to the
right atrium (#37). The effusion appears loculated -
?pericardial cyst.

IMPRESSION: Small/moderate loculated anterior pericardial
effusion c/w ? pericardial cyst. Normal biventricular cavity
sizes with preserved global and regional biventricular systolic
function. Dilated ascending aorta. Pulmonary artery
hypertension.
.
CTA Chest ([**2169-4-28**]):
1. No pulmonary embolism or aortic pathology identified.
2. Large right loculated simple appearing pleural effusion
without areas of rim enhancement or complex density to suggest
superimposed infectious process. Significant amount of adjacent
pulmonary parenchymal collapse is identified in all right lobes
particularly the right lower lobe.
3. Hypodensity in the lateral aspect of the collapsed right lobe
likely due to pneumonia.
4. Evidence of right heart strain with enlarged right ventricle
and
straightening of the interventricular septum.

Brief Hospital Course:
52 M with HTN and UC who was recently admitted to [**Hospital3 **]
ICU with necrotizing pneumonia, presented again with persistent
SOB, fevers and a para pneumonic effusion.
.
# Pneumonia with Para pneumonic Effusion
Started on vancomycin, cefepime and levofloxacin the MICU. CT
scan showed a para pneumonic effusion on the lower right lobe.
Drained 1.7L by paracentesis while in the MICU, with fluid
showing an exudative pathology. Chest tube remained in place and
on suction.

On [**4-30**] he underwent a right VATS decortication and tolerated
the procedure well.  He returned to the PACU in st
