Date of Birth:   [**2041-9-2**]       Sex:  M

Service:  CARDIOTHORACIC SURGERY

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This 71-year-old gentleman with
hypereosinophilia and hemoptysis from [**2107**] who had a work-up
that revealed probable vasculitis.  He was placed on
high-dose steroids which resolved his pulmonary process and
hypereosinophilia, but during the work-up, it was noted that
he had dramatic decrease in his left ventricular function.
Echocardiogram from [**2107**] showed an ejection fraction greater
than 50, but repeat echocardiogram showed an ejection
fraction of less than 20% also in [**2107**].  Cardiac
catheterization in [**2107**] did show some coronary disease with
moderate pulmonary hypertension and evidence of a
left-to-right shunt due to an ASD.  He has been medically
managed since [**2107**] and was referred for both coronary and
lower extremity angiography because of bilateral
claudication, right worse than left.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1.  Hypertension.  2.
Hypercholesterolemia.  3.  Insulin-dependent diabetes
mellitus.  4.  Churg-[**Doctor Last Name 3532**] syndrome/vasculitis.  5.
Hypereosinophilia.  6.  Congestive heart failure.  7.
Coronary artery disease.  8.  Vertebral artery stenosis.  9.
Peripheral vascular disease.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Bilateral cataract surgery.

ALLERGIES:  NO KNOWN DRUG ALLERGIES.

LABORATORY DATA:  Preoperatively his labs revealed a white
count of 7.3, hematocrit 35.7, platelet count 238; sodium
141, potassium 5.5, chloride 102, CO2 30, BUN 26, creatinine
1.4, blood sugar 240; INR 1.2.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Aspirin 325 q.d., Captopril 50 mg
p.o. t.i.d., Digoxin 0.125 alternating with 0.25 mg q.d.,
Lasix 40 mg p.o. q.d., Lente Insulin 40 U q.a.m., Humalog
Insulin sliding scale with meals, Lipitor 60 mg p.o. q.d.,
Trental 400 mg p.o. t.i.d., Prednisone 30 mg alternating with
Prednisone 20 mg q.d., Ranitidine 150 mg p.o. q.d., Bactrim
q.d.

He was referred for cardiac catheterization which was
performed on the 31st which showed 60% left main disease, 80%
left anterior descending disease, 100% circumflex lesion, 80%
ramus lesion, 100% right coronary artery lesion.  He also had
significant disease with near total occlusion of his right
superficial femoral artery and moderate diffuse disease in
his left superficial femoral artery.  Please refer to the
cardiac catheterization report for the lower extremity
angiography.  Cardiac catheterization also showed evidence of
a left-to-right shunt.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  HEENT:  On preoperative exam he had no
jugular venous distention or bruits.  Lungs:  He had
decreased breath sounds at the bases.  Heart: Regular, rate
and rhythm.  There was a grade 2/6 systolic ejection murmur
heard best at the second intercostal space.  Abdomen:  He had
positive bowel sounds.  Nontender and nondistended abdomen.
He had a negative [**Known lastname **] test on the right side.  He had
decreased distal pulses.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  On [**11-18**], the patient underwent
coronary artery bypass grafting times three with a LIMA to
the left anterior descending, vein graft to the ramus, and
vein graft to the posterior descending artery.  In addition,
he had closure of his ASD.  He was transferred to the
Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit in stable condition.

On postoperative day #1, he had no events overnight, with a
stable blood pressure of 137/62.  He continued on his
perioperative Vancomycin.  He was on no hemodynamic drips at
that time.  His postoperative hematocrit was 27.5, with a
white count of 12.0, BUN of 19, creatinine of 1.2, potassium
4.5.  He had decreased breath sounds at the bases but no air
leak.  His heart was regular, rate and rhythm.  His incisions
were clean, dry, and intact.  He was alert and taking
morphine for pain.  He was restarted on his Lasix and ACE
inhibitors.  His diet was advanced.  He began the steroid
taper.  His hematocrit was stable.  He remained in the
Intensive Care Unit.

On postoperative day #2, he was on Amiodarone drip and was in
normal sinus rhythm at 81, with a T-max of 99.1?????? and blood
pressure 134/75.  His hematocrit came down slightly to 23.2.
His BUN and creatinine remained stable.  His lungs again had
decreased breath sounds at the bases.  He was alert.  He was
seen by the [**Last Name (un) **] Diabetes Service for tighter management of
his blood sugar.  He was also seen by Physical Therapy and
transferred out to the floor.

He began ambulation on the floor.  On [**11-21**],
postoperative day #3, his blood pressure was 165/81.  He was
in sinus rhythm in the 70s, with an oxygen saturation of 94%
on room air.  His hematocrit was back up to 26.4.  He was up
approximately 5 kg from his preoperative weight.  Potassium
was 4.6, BUN 34, and creatinine 1.8.  He was alert and
oriented and was conversant.  He had been ambulating quite
easily multiple times on the floor.  His pacing wires were
pulled.  He converted back to sinus rhythm with the Lopressor
and Amiodarone.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  Aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d., Ranitidine
150 mg p.o. q.d., Prednisone 30 mg alternating with
Prednisone 20 mg q.d., Lente Insulin 40 U q.d., Amiodarone
200 mg p.o. b.i.d. x 7 days, Amiodarone 200 mg p.o. q.d.,

p.o. q.d., regular Insulin sliding scale, Percocet p.o. [**1-20**]
tab p.o. p.r.n. q.4 hours.

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:  He was given instructions to
follow-up in the [**Hospital 409**] Clinic in two weeks.  He is to
