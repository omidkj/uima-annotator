CT Abd:
1. Marked [**Month/Day/Year 1106**] calcifications.
2. Similar pancreatic calcifications, which can be seen in
chronic pancreatitis.
3. Ascites and diffuse edema in the intra-abdominal fat, as well
as bibasilar pleural effusions.
4. Calcific density in the left lower lobe which may represent a
granuloma but is of unclear etiology.
5. Areas of increased density in the right lung base. As some of
these are over 100 Hounsfield units, these are probably either
calcifications or representative of contrast which may have been
aspirated, which is felt more likely. This finding was discussed
with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on the same evening.
6. Atrophic native kidneys.
7. Left lower quadrant renal transplant not well evaluated here
and better evaluated on a renal ultrasound of the same day.

CXR:
1. Interval development of retrocardiac opacity, new since the
previous examination of three hours prior. Differential
possibilities would include left lower lobe collapse or
aspiration.
2. Right internal jugular central venous catheter terminates in
the right atrium. More optimal positioning would be achieved if
this line were pulled back 3.5 cm.

EKG:
NS, normal interval, R axis, delayed RW progression. ST
depressions in lateral leads.

US Abd:
1. Status post cholecystectomy.
2. Mildly dilated 5 mm pancreatic duct. This appearance can be
seen in chronic pancreatitis.
3. Right pleural effusion.
4. Ring down artifacts consistent with pneumobilia centrally.
This area is not well evaluated on the CT of the same day given
streak artifacts from cholecystectomy clips. This appearance
could be due to the presence of clips and central pneumobilia,
which could be associated with a prior ERCP with sphincterotomy.
Correlation regarding history of ERCP is recommended.

RENAL US:
1. Normal vasculature within transplanted kidney.
2. Thickening of the transplant renal pelvis which could
represent chronic inflammatory change, or intrapelvic debris
(blood, pus).

Brief Hospital Course:
1.  Sepsis:
This likely represented urosepsis given pos UA.  The patient had
a history of resistant e.coli which was sensitive to Cefepime.
Initially, the patient was also covered for PNA given new
retrocardiac opacity, concerning for respiratory infection; of
note, the there was no cough reported on presentation.  Given a
history of  diarrhea, cdiff was considered - stool toxin was
negative x2.

She was started on vancomycin, azithromycin and cefepime.
Required large fluid volumes for resuscitation initially.  SvO2
was > 70 (did not require transfusion or inotropes) and CVPs
were maintained above >[**7-19**].   Patient required norepinephrine
to maintain MAPs >65 from admission until [**8-29**].  She was
empirically started on stress dose steroids, which were tapered
back to her home dose on [**9-1**].

On [**8-28**] 2/4 bottles grew GNR, which speciated e.coli, sensitive
to ceftaz (presumably cefepime).   Eventually 3/4 bottles grew
E. coli, however Ucx did not.  Sensitivities were checked and
she was changed to PO Augmentin.  Plan was for continued
antibiotics for five additional days.

Patient improved remarkably and on transfer to the floor she was
afebrile with SBPs in the 150s.  Her WBC continued to trend down
and was 9.4 on discharge.  She continued to diurese on the floor
and plan was for continued diuresis upon discharge.

2. ARF on CRF:
Likely due to hypotension. SCr was 3.1 on admission.  With fluid
repletion trended down to 1.9 on transfer and continued to trend
down to 1.0 upon discharge.  An US did not show evidence of
obstruction.

3. Elevated liver enzymes:
Likely due to hypotension. No RUQ pain.  Trended down following
volume repletion.

4. Renal/Pancreas transplant:
Was continued on cellcept for immunosuppression.  Tacrolimus was
dosed by level per renal recs.

5. Access:
RIJ placed on admission and pulled on the floor.

6. PPX:
Maintained on PPI, heparin sc, pneumoboots

7. Code:
Full while in house.
