Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2387**]
Chief Complaint:
sepsis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none


History of Present Illness:
This is an 80 yo F who is independent in all her ADLs w/ PMH sig
for CAD s/p CABG & s/p LMain/OM1 stent on [**6-9**], DM, Afib, CHF w/
EF 40%, 3+MR, PVD, GERD, CRI w/ a bl Cr of 1.5, recent digoxin
toxicity who initially presented on [**12-14**] with 2 days of
generalized weakness, productive cough, low grade fevers, and
poor PO intake. In the ED, she was found to have a WBC of 18,
lacate of 6.3, SBPs in the 80s-90s, in rapid A-fib to the 120s,
and a CXR w/ a ?LUL infiltrate. As a result, she was begun on
the MUST sepsis protocol and started on empiric
levaquin/vancomycin/flagyl for a presumed pneumonia. She was
also noted on admission to be hyponatremic w/ a Na of 126,
hyperkalemic w/ a K of 6.2, acidotic w/ an anion gap of 22,
hypercalcemic w/ a Ca of 10.4, in acute renal failure w/ a Cr of
3.3, anemic with a 7 point Hct drop after only 7 hours, and a
mildly elevated troponin thought to be [**3-9**] demand ischemia. MICU
course notable for continued bleeding from RIJ site for which
she received a total of 5u PRBC (last [**12-15**]), 7u FFP to reverse
her coumadin coagulopathy, and a special suture by the surgical
team. Her HD stablized w/ fluids alone (no pressors ever
required). Because cultures remained negative, her vanc & flagyl
were d/c'd [**12-16**], and she was left only on levaquin.
.
Currently, pt without any complaints. Hasn't gotten out of bed
as yet. States her breathing is back to baseline and cough much
improved. Tol reg diet.

[**12-18**]: Renal US: patent flow to both kidneys with no waveform
abnormalities.  ?hyperechoic/hypoechoic mass in mid portion of
left kidney

Brief Hospital Course:
Assessment/Plan: 80F w/ resolved septic shock [**3-9**] presumed
pneumonia (although CXR unimpressive), iatrogenic acute blood
loss anemia [**3-9**] line placement, acute on chronic renal failure
likely [**3-9**] ATN, and troponin leak likely [**3-9**] demand ischemia.

1.  Pneumonia- on admission, pt had a septic picture.  She was
hypotensive, febrile, had a Lactate of 6.  She was treated for
probable sepsis with fluid resuscitation, antibiotics
([**Last Name (un) **]/flagyl/vanco), and stress-dose steroids.  Her hemodynamic
status quickly recovered, and she never required pressors.  Her
sputum and blood cultures were negative, and CXR was not
impressive for an infiltrate (more consistent with CHF).  She
remained afebrile with a falling white blood cell count.  Her
Vanco/Flagyl were discontinued after 3 days.  After transfer to
the floor, her levofloxacin was discontinued (as per the
attending) after 4 days of therapy.  She remained afebrile and
stable.  She was weaned off NC O2.  Follow up CXR was more
consistent with pulmonary edema.
2.  Anemia - While in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], she had a 7 point HCT drop 2/2 a
bleed from her right IJ line.  She required 5 UPRBC, 7U FFP (to
reverse INR for her coumadin therapy), and a surgical suture to
control the bleeding.  Her HCT remained stable after this
incident with no further bleeding for drop in hematocrit.

3.  CAD - She had a troponin leak (to 1.29) with no significant
EKG changes or symptoms.  This leak was thought to be [**3-9**] demand
ischemia in the setting of acute blood loss (from right IJ).
She was continued on ASA, metoprolol, lipitor,
hydralazine/lipitor (no ACE [**3-9**] poor renal function).  She had
no symptoms of chest pain while on the floor.

4.  CHF - Recent TTE at NEBH showed EF=40%.  Her Lasix was
initially held due to her hypovolemia but was restarted as she
had signs of volume overload on CXR and on lung exam.  She was
discharged on a dose of 80 mg Lasix (was on 120 as an
outpatient).  This can be titrated up by her primary
cardiologist.

5.  A-fib - She was rate-controlled on low dose beta blocker.
Her anticoagulation was initially held [**3-9**] her RIJ bleed.  On
transfer to the floor, she was restarted on coumadin (bridged
with coumadin) for a goal INR [**3-10**]. She was discharged before her
INR was therapeutic, so she was bridged with Lovenox, to be
continued until her follow-up appointment on [**12-22**].

6.  ARF - She presented with a creatinine of 3.6 (baseline
1.3-1.6).  This was thought to be possibly secondary to ATN
(hypovolemia, acute blood loss).  Her FeNA and FeBUN did not
suggest a prerenal etiology.  Renal US showed patent flow to
both kidneys (done to evaluate for renal artery stenosis).  A
hyperechoic/hypoechoic mass was seen in the midportion of her
left kidney.  A CT or MRI as an outpatient is recommended to
follow up with this.  On discharge, her creatinine had improved
to 2.3.  Phoslo was used while in-house for hyperphospatemia but
was discontinued on discharge.

7.  DM - Her glipizide and glucophage were initially held [**3-9**]
her ARF.  She was covered with SSI while in-house with good
blood sugar control.  She was discharged just on glipizide
(continued to hold glucophage [**3-9**] renal function).  Her DM meds
can be titrated as an outpatient.

8.  Electrolytes: She was hypercalcemic, hypokalemic, on
admission.  These both resolved with hydration, repletion of K,
holding of lasix initially.

10.  Proph - pneumoboots, bowel regimen, hep/coumadin were
continued in-house

11.  Dispo - She was discharged after stabilization of her renal
function.  Although PT recommended home PT, she refused this and
was discharged to home.  She will follow up with her
cardiologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 11679**], on [**12-22**] at 3:30 pm.
