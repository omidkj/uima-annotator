Imaging:
PET scan [**2119-2-16**]:
IMPRESSION: 1. Large left renal lesion comprised of an FDG-avid
solid superior portion with SUVmax 6.9 and a septated photopenic
inferior component surrounded by an FDG-avid capsule is
worrisome for malignancy. 2. Non-FDG-avid spiculated left lung
lesion tethering towards a large pleural plaque abutted by a
semisolid lesion may represent scarring, a malignant neoplasm
can not be excluded. 3.
FDG-avid soft tissue nodule in the subcutaneous tissues of the
right breast may refpresent a superficial infection or a
pilonidal cyst and bears watching. Clinical correlation is
suggested. 4. Enlarged prostate contains calcifications and
shows low-grade FDG avidity. 5. Non-enlarged FDG-avid left
internal jugular node bears watching.

CXR post-op: CVL in distal IVC, no pneumothorax or infiltrate
