MICROBIOLOGY
BCX: NEGATIVE
UCX: NEGATIVE

IMAGING:

CXR [**2105-12-18**]
FINDINGS: Single frontal view of the chest was obtained. There
is mild
elevation of the left hemidiaphragm with overlying atelectasis.
Slight
decrease in volume of the left lung as compared to the right.
Prominence of
the hila is unchanged. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes
are stable.
The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are unchanged. No
pleural effusion or
pneumothorax is seen.

IMPRESSION: Mild elevation of the left hemidiaphragm with
overlying
atelectasis. No definite focal consolidation or pleural
effusion.

ECHO [**2105-12-19**]
The left atrium is elongated. Left ventricular wall thickness,
cavity size and regional/global systolic function are normal
(LVEF >55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus
level. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but
aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral
regurgitation. Mild to moderate ([**12-6**]+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is
moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Moderate pulmonary artery hypertension.
Mild-moderate mitral regurgitation. Moderate tricuspid
regurgitation. Preserved global and regional biventricular
systolic function.

Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable
for review) of [**2103-5-2**], the severity of tricuspid
regurgitation and the estimated pulmonary artery systolic
pressure are slightly increased.

V/Q SCAN [**2105-12-19**]
IMPRESSION: Low likelihood ratio for acute pulmonary embolism.

RENAL US [**2105-12-19**]
RENAL ULTRASOUND: The right kidney measures 11.7 cm. The left
kidney
measures 12.5 cm. The previously documented left interpolar
subcentimeter
cyst is no longer visualized in the current study. There is no
hydronephrosis, hydroureter, renal mass or calculi. The spleen
measures 12.3
cm. There are small bilateral pleural effusions, left greater
than right.

IMPRESSION: No hydroureteronephrosis, renal mass or calculi.
