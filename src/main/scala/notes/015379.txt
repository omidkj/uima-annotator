Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7934**]
Chief Complaint:
Respiratory arrest



Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Central Line Placement
Transjugular liver biopsy

History of Present Illness:
HPI - This is a 37 y/o male with relapsed AML, s/p unrelated
unmatched alloBMT day +59, course c/b VRE bacteremia ([**7-14**]),
aspergillus lung infection in [**2099**], GVHD, recent stay in [**Hospital Unit Name 153**]
for sepsis of unclear etiology (although grew pseudomonas and
enterococcus from pus from foley catheter) on long-standing
broad-spectrum abx, who was transferred to the ICU this
afternoon s/p code blue for respiratory arrest.
This afternoon, the patient was sitting in his chair and was
noted to become hypotensive from a lying to sitting position
(SBP drop to 70's) and suddenly unresponsive with hypoxia on 4L,
with sats of 80's on NRB. He was emergently intubated on the
floor and was started on Neo for a brief time when SBP's fell to
the 50's s/p intubation and sedation. By the time he arrived to
the ICU (approx 10 min later), his SBP had improved to the 90's
and he was weaned off the Neo gtt.
At the time of intubation, he was noted to have brown, copious
secretions at the back of his throat, requiring suctioning.

Relevant Imaging:
[**2101-7-27**] RUQ US: This study is somewhat limited by patient body
habitus.  The liver demonstrates diffuse increase in
echogenicity consistent with fatty infiltration.  No focal
hepatic lesions are identified. There is no intra- or
extra-hepatic biliary ductal dilatation.  The common duct
measures 6 mm.  The gallbladder contains shadowing stones and
sludge, but
there is no evidence of wall thickening, or pericholecystic
fluid.  There is no ascites.  Limited views of the right kidney
demonstrate no hydronephrosis. There is appropriate hepatopetal
portal vein blood flow.
[**2101-8-4**] Colonoscopy: scattered areas of ereythema throughout the
colon
[**2101-8-7**] CT Abdomen/pelvis: Diffuse wall thickening and luminal
narrowing of the entire large and small bowel, with segments of
small bowel demonstrating an intramural low attenuation rim;
these findings are suggestive of graft versus host disease given
the history of allogenic [**Month/Day/Year 3242**]. Other differential considerations
include other microvasculopathies and/or hypovolemic state. No
free intraperitoneal air.
Distended stomach with no contrast seen to pass past the antrum;
a delayed KUB could be obtained to ensure passage of barium and
exclude gastroparesis or obstruction.
Ground glass and tree-in-[**Male First Name (un) 239**] opacities involving the right
middle lobe and left lower lobes.  Small bilateral pleural
effusions.  Small pericardial effusion. 4-mm focal nodule at the
left lung base with a ground glass halo. Findings are
nonspecific, but most suggestive of an infectious process.
Cholelithiasis.
[**2101-8-16**] EGD: Erythema and nodularity in the whole duodenum
compatible with duodenitis (biopsy) Biopsies were taken from the
duodenum for viral culture and histology Otherwise normal EGD to
second part of the duodenum
[**2101-8-26**]: Duplex doppler US liver: Moderately distended
gallbladder with sludge and stones, but gallbladder wall
thickening not as prominent on today's study.  Cholecystitis is
not currently suspected, but if clinical suspicion persists or
increases, repeat ultrasound and/or HIDA scan can be performed.
Diminished flow within proximal left portal vein, with flow
distally.
[**2101-8-29**] CT abdomen: Diffuse ill-defined patchy pulmonary
opacities are diffuse infection versus asymmetric pulmonary
edema.  There are enlarging and moderate bilateral pleural
effusions.  New small fluid in the abdomen and pelvis secondary
to third spacing. Evaluation of the bowel is limited given lack
of IV contrast, but bowel wall thickening is again seen
suggestive of graft versus host disease.
[**9-12**] CXR - pulmonary edema, improved from CXR on [**2101-8-30**]

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: Patient is a 38yo male w/ DM, relapsed AML neutropenic,
with acute respiratory failure

1. Respiratory distress/arrest: Pt emergently intubated on the
floor due to acute respiratory failure. Etiology for respiratory
arrest on admission continues to remain unclear, possible acute
worsening of pleural effusions secondary to GVHD versus
infection. Additionally mucous plugging versus aspiration
pneumonia should also be considered. Pt does have pleural
effusions on cxray but after [**Date Range 3242**] at this time is recommending
not to tap. Pt underwent bronchoscopy and continues to be
unrevealing for etiology, BAL cultures are NGTD. PCP and
legionella negative. He was continued on IV Methylprednisolone.
Pt was continued on broad spectrum antibiotics-Daptomycin,
Meropenem, Micofungin, and Vancomycin. The antibiotics were
slowly peeled off as the family progressed to comfort measures
only.

2. Hypotension: This was intermittent, occurring prior to
respiratory arrest and after in
