RADS

[**5-15**] CT head: 1) Multiple areas of subdural, subarachnoid, and
intraparenchymal hemorrhage. 2) Multiple chronic lacunar
infarcts. 3) Periventricular chronic small vessel ischemic
disease.

[**5-15**] OSH CT C-spine: no fracture/malalignment

[**5-15**] TL spine: neg

[**5-17**] MR head: Multiple intraparenchymal hemorrhages as well
as intraventricular, subdural and subarachnoid hemorrhages are
identified.
Chronic small vessel disease is seen in the periventricular
white matter with diffuse changes with multiple small chronic
infarcts. Diffusion abnormalities are noted, which correspond to
the blood products on susceptibility-weighted images and most
likely represent blood products than small acute infarcts. No
territorial infarcts are seen.

[**5-17**] MR spine: No definite evidence of vertebral, bony or
ligamentous trauma. No evidence of ligamentous disruption is
noted. Chronic degenerative changes are seen in the cervical
region.

[**5-20**] MRA brain: Absence of flow signal in the P2 segment of the
left posterior cerebral artery, a small area of stenosis cannot
be excluded. Faint opacification of the right posterior cerebral
artery. Consider CT angiogram if clinically indicated. Anterior
cerebral arteries and middle cerebral arteries are within normal
limits.

[**6-2**] RUQ US: Normal liver, gallbladder ultrasound.

[**6-10**] Renal US: Normal renal ultrasound

[**6-12**] CXR: The appearance of the lung fields, the cardiac contour,
and mediastinal contours are stable in appearance.
