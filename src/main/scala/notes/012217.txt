Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 783**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of Breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation

History of Present Illness:
Pt is a 66 y/o with past medical history significant for COPD
(no O2 at home with PFT from [**2161**]-Increaded FEV1/FVC,decreased
DLCO) and [**1-6**] pack per day smoking history (for decades)
presents to the ED from her PCP's office with a four day history
of worsening SOB, cough, sputum production and hemoptysis. She
reports four day smoking cessation prior to symptoms and denies
chest pain/tightness/palpitation, sore-throats/head
congestion/runny nose, fevers/chills/night sweats/unintentional
weight loss, nausea/vomiting, diarrhea/constipation/melena,
changes in urination, light-headedness. In her PCP's office
prior to the ED she was found to be 76%RA which improved to 90s
with supplemental O2.
.
In the ED initial vitals were: T:96.8 HR:94 HTN:165/80 RR:20 O2
Sat:94%on 4L. On exam she had diminished breath sounds with
wheezes, after nebs. Was given steroids - methyl prednisone
125mg. CXR concerning for right middle lobe pneumonia, hence
started on ceftriaxone and azithromycin. ABG-7.25/78/99 and was
started on BiPAP but could only tolerate it for 20 minutes. Was
then given ativan with sats stable in the low 90s on 5L. Her
initial Peak flow was 75. Her vitals at the time of transfer to
the MICU were: 93, 21, 176/73 94% 5L.
.
In the MICU she continued to be hypoxic on RA thought to be from
pneumonia vs. pneumonitis vs. COPD exacerbation, not pulmonary
edema. Sputum cultures were negative and was continued on
steroids, nebs and anti-biotics (azithromycin was d/c and
levofloxacin was added on 2nd day. CT showed diffuse bronchial
wall thickening with associated diffuse tree-in-bronchial and
centrilobular nodular opacities likely due to infection. With
worsening pulmonary function, she was intubated and extubated
twice (most recently [**5-9**]), completed steroid burst and left
the MICU on 95% on nasal cannula. For BP control, her home HCTZ
was held, diuresed with furosemide and started on metop. Her
metformin was held for diabetes control and was started on
sliding scale. Pt.'s MICU was also complicated by
agitation/confusion/altered mental status change thought to be
delirium and received atypical anti-psychotics and anti-anxiety
medication.
On arrival to the floor, vital signs stable but breathing 92% on
1L, comfortable in bed and consistently requesting to be
discharged. Denies fever/chills/night sweats/recent weight loss
or gain, headache/rhinorrhea/congestion, cough/SOB, chest
pain/chest pressure/palpitations,nausea/vomiting,
diarrhea/constipation/abdominal pain, dysuria/frequency/urgency.

Brief Hospital Course:
#.HYPOXIA: Patient was intubated secondary to hypoxic and
hypercarbic respiratory failure.  CT scan showed tree-in [**Male First Name (un) 239**]
opacities inidcative of possible atypical pneumonia.  She was
treated with levofloxacin and ceftriaxone for a total 7 day
course.  She was also given 5 day course of pulse steroids for
COPD exacerbation, along with nebulizer treatments.  There was
no evidence of PE on CTA. Required antipsychotics as well as
Precedex drip for agitation.  Experienced an episode of severe
bradycardia with 15 second asystolic pause requiring two chest
compressions.  Returned to sinus without complications and
Precedex was discontinued. She was able to be extubated on ICU
Day 6.  When she left the MICU on 95% on nasal cannula and she
was successfully transitioned to breathing room air on the
floor. Her discharge O2 sats were 92% at rest and 89-91% with
activity on room air. She will follow up with pulmonary as an
outpatient.
.
#.DELIRIUM: Around the time of extubation, patient was agitated
and showing signs of delerium.  Thought to be secondary to ICU
delirium vs. infectious process, hypoxia, prolonged ICU stay,
steroid administration.  CT neg for intracranial process. She
was given seroquel for agitated delirium and ativan for anxiety.
