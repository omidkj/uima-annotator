Service:  [**Hospital1 **]

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  The patient is admitted with a chief
complaint of fever.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 44 year old male with
multiple medical problems, including several episodes of
endocarditis, status post homograft aortic valve replacement
times two, status post aortic valve outflow traction route
debridement, status post pseudomonal pneumonia, intermittent
pancreatitis, diabetes mellitus type II, coronary artery
disease status post coronary artery bypass graft,
hypercalcemia, critical care neuropathy, who was recently
cared for at [**Hospital3 672**] from [**2159-8-17**] to [**2159-9-14**]
following his pseudomonal pneumonia, who presented on [**10-5**]
with fevers, chills, dizziness, and unproductive cough, as
well as a one day history of vomiting.  The patient denied
any headache, visual changes, chest pain, pleuritic pain,
back pain, abdominal pain, diarrhea, blood per rectum,
melena, dysuria, rash, or joint pain.  In the Emergency
Department he was found to have a temperature of 103.2 and
was started on empiric antibiotics consisting of vancomycin
and cefepime.  He became hypotensive in the Emergency
Department with systolic blood pressure that fell to the 80s
and was given a normal saline bolus as well as continuous
normal saline.  A right internal jugular central line was
placed and the patient was transferred to the Intensive Care
Unit for further management of his sepsis.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Several episodes of endocarditis with route abscess,
status post aortic valve replacement times two and route
debridement with homograft in [**2156-12-30**].  His
endocarditis was complicated by septic emboli to the central
nervous system, to the lungs, and to the kidneys.  The
patient was noted to have transient atrial fibrillation
during part of his hospitalization for endocarditis.
2.  Congestive heart failure.  The patient has 4+ mitral
regurgitation, mild tricuspid regurgitation, and mild
pulmonary artery hypertension.
3.  Coronary artery disease status post coronary artery

vein graft to his left anterior descending and saphenous vein
graft to a right coronary artery.
4.  Status post chronic ventilator dependence with
pseudomonal colonization.
5.  Cryptogenic hypercalcemia.  The patient was noted to have
a low PDH, low 25 hydroxy vitamin D, and a PTHRP that was
negative.  He was found to have a heterotopic calcification
of his left shoulder and responded to Pamidronate as well as
active vitamin D repletion.
6.  The patient was diagnosed with a seizure disorder at the
age of 12, but has been seizure-free since diagnosis with
maintenance on Keppra.
7.  The patient has a history of fungemia.
8.  The patient has a history of bowel dysmotility that was
previously treated with Reglan and erythromycin.

tube abutting pylorus.
14. History of hypoxic encephalopathy.
15. Chronic intermittent chemical pancreatitis.
16. History of multiple pneumonias.
17. History of severe esophagitis (question mark ischemic
esophagus [**12-31**]).
18. Prepyloric ulcer in [**1-29**].
19. Depression.
20. Question mark transient ischemic attack in [**2156**].
21. Adult respiratory distress syndrome.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives at home with his
girlfriend.  [**Name (NI) **] is divorced.  No tobacco or ethanol history.
He has a brother and a sister.

FAMILY HISTORY:  There is no known history of
immunodeficiency or valve disease.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Temperature 98; pulse 64;
blood pressure 93/37; oxygen saturation rate 96% on 2 liters
oxygen.  General:  Middle aged thin male in no acute
distress.  Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat:  Pupils are
equal, round, and reactive to light, extraocular movements
intact, sclera anicteric, mucous membranes are moist,
oropharynx is clear.  Neck:  Supple, tracheostomy site is

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  The patient was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit for
treatment of his sepsis.  The source of his sepsis remains
unclear but he responded well to broad speculum empiric
antibiotics that consisted of vancomycin, tobramycin, and
Flagyl.  A radial arterial line was briefly in place for
invasive blood pressure monitoring while the patient was in
the Intensive Care Unit.  The patient rapidly defervesced and
had a white count that declined from 14.2 on [**10-4**], peaking at
15.1 on [**10-5**], and then subsequently declined to 6.4 on the
day of discharge.  All blood cultures remained negative.
Fungal culture was negative and central catheter tip culture
was also negative.  Sputum cultures were likewise negative,
and urine culture was negative as well.

Given the patient's history of multiple episodes of
endocarditis and his presentation with fever of uncertain
etiology, a transthoracic endocardiogram was carried out on
[**10-5**].  The echocardiogram demonstrated an ejection fraction
of greater than 55% with a mildly dilated left atrium and
mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy as well as left
ventricular cavity that was mildly dilated and depressed
right systolic function with thickened prosthetic aortic
valve leaflet, but no masses or vegetation seen on his aortic
valve.  There was 1+ aortic regurgitation, there was 4+
severe mitral regurgitation, but no vegetation seen on the
valve, and there was trace tricuspid regurgitation, and again
no vegetations on the valve.  Likewise, there was physiologic
pulmonary regurgitation without any vegetation of the
pulmonic valve.  Given the patient's history, however, of
multiple episodes of endocarditis, a follow-up
transesophageal echocardiogram was obtained on [**10-10**] and
demonstrated again a left ejection fraction of greater than
55% and again demonstrated the absence of any masses or
vegetation on any of his heart valves.  Again, noted was
severe mitral regurgitation with partial flail of the
anterior leaflet and mild aortic regurgitation.  The patient
remained afebrile off antibiotics from [**10-7**] through the day
of discharge.

2.  Renal.  The patient was found to be in mild acute renal
failure on admission.  His creatinine was up from his
baseline of 0.6 to 1.6 on date of admission and decreased to
1.1 on the day of discharge.  It was thought that he was
having acute renal failure, secondary to pre-renal ischemia
related to his sepsis on admission. His dose of his ace
inhibitor, Lisinopril, was decreased from 10 mg to 5 mg on
the day of discharge.

3.  Diabetes mellitus.  The patient was maintained on a
regular insulin sliding scale with excellent control of his
blood sugars.

4.  Gastrointestinal.  The patient was maintained on a bowel
regimen and this continued with his four times a day Reglan.

5.  Depression.  The patient was continued on his outpatient
anti-depression regimen.

6.  Malnutrition.  A nutrition consult was obtained and the
patient was g
