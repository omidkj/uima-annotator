History of Present Illness:
Patient is an 84-year old woman with multiple medical problems
including [**Name (NI) 2320**], HTN, afib, who was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] from OSH
for cardiac cath. Patient had been taken to OSH after
experiencing post-prandial 10/10 chest pain at 5 PM 2 days PTA.
Patient reported that the pain radiated up her ears and to her
lower back, and was associated with diaphoresis. She denied any
shortness of breath, nausea, vomiting, or lightheadedness at the
time. Pain was ameliorated with SL NTG and morphine at OSH
Emergency Department. Aortic dissection was ruled out with CT
scan. EKG showed 1st degree AV block, inferior/lateral ST
depressions with T-wave inversions. Cardiac enzymes were
positive with peak CK 157 and positive fractionation at OSH. She
was started on NTG gtt, ASA, and BB. Her INR was 3.5 and 5mg SQ
Vitamin K were given at 1:35 PM ([**8-6**]). Patient has not had any
episodes of chest pain, shortness of breath, diaphoresis since.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 7730**] was pain free on admission. She remained stable on
medical therapy. Given her prothrombin time, additional Vitamin
K was given. Once her coagulation studies improved, cardiac
catheterization was performed on [**8-8**]. Angiography showed a
right dominant system with 80% distal stenosis of the left main
coronary artery; 95% mid lesion in the left anterior descending,
70% stenosis in the circumflex and a 60% stenosis in the right
coronary artery. Left ventriculography revealed no mitral
regurgitation, focal apical severe hypokinesis and an ejection
fraction of 55%. Based on the above results, she was referred
for surgical coronary revascularization. Further evaluation
included a carotid ultrasound which found minimal disease of
both internal carotid arteries. The rest of her evaluation was
unremarkable and she was cleared for surgery.

On [**8-9**], Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] performed three vessel coronary artery
bypass grafting utilizing the left internal mammary artery graft
to the left anterior descending and reverse saphenous vein
grafts to right coronary artery and obtuse marginal. Following
the operation, she was brought to the CSRU for invasive
monitoring. Within 24 hours, she was extubated and awoke
neurologically intact. Diuretics were initiated. She was started
on Amiodarone given bouts of postoperative paroxysmal atrial
fibrillation. She otherwise maintained stable hemodynamics and
transferred to the SDU on postoperative day three. She required
transfer back to the CSRU on postoperative day four for acute
respiratory distress. An echocardiogram was performed at that
time, showing only a small pericardial effusion with no
echocardiographic signs of tamponade. With aggressive diuresis
and  pulmonary toilet, her pulmonary status improved over the
next 24 hours. She did not require re-intubation. On
postoperative day five, she returned to the SDU. She continued
to require diuresis. By discharge, her fluid status improved
with oxygen saturations of 96% on room air. She remained in a
normal sinus rhythm without further episodes of paroxsymal
atrial fibrillation. She tolerated Amiodarone and Lopressor.
Amiodarone will be tapered after discharge. The rest of her
hospital course was uneventful and she was discharged to [**Hospital 30527**] on postoperative day six.
