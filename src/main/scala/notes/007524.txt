Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1283**]
Chief Complaint:
Heart murmur

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2165-12-31**] Bentall Procedure utilizing a 25mm St. [**Male First Name (un) 923**] Mechanical
Aortic Valved Graft


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 37 year old male who was recently noted to have a
significant change in long standing history of heart murmur. A
follow up echocardiogram revealed bicuspid aortic valve with
severe aortic insufficiency. It was also notable for a dilated
aortic root and ascending aortic aneurysm measuring 7.5
centimeters. Subsequent chest CT scan confirmed marked
dilatation of the ascending thoracic aorta measuring up to 8.4 x
8.5 cm. In preperation for cardiac surgical intervention, he
underwent coronary CT angiogram which showed a left dominant
system and normal coronary arteries.

Past Medical History:
Biscuspid Aortic Valve, Aortic Insufficiency, Aortic Aneurysm,
History of Migraine Headaches, Asthma, Chronic Rhinitis


Social History:
Denies tobacco. Admits to only social ETOH. Currently lives with
his partner and works in data and information management.

Family History:
Denies premature coronary artery disease

RADIOLOGY  Final Report

CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2166-1-4**] 9:51 PM

CHEST (PA & LAT)

Reason: assess for cardiopulmonary process

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
37 year old man s/p Bentall procedure (AVR garft) POD4 with
fever
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
assess for cardiopulmonary process
CHEST SINGLE VIEW ON [**1-4**]

HISTORY: Status post AV graft with fever.

FINDINGS: A prosthetic aortic valve, sternotomy wires, and
mediastinal clips are unchanged. There continues to be bibasilar
volume loss with small bilateral effusions that are not
significantly changed compared to the prior day. There is no new
infiltrate.

cavity. Overall normal LVEF (>55%).

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTA: Markedly dilated aortic sinus. Markedly dilated ascending
aorta. Normal aortic arch diameter. Normal descending aorta

TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets with trivial
TR.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflets.
Physiologic (normal) PR.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify I was present in compliance with HCFA
regulations. The patient was under general anesthesia throughout
the procedure. No TEE related complications.
Conclusions
Pre bypass: There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is moderately dilated.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
The aortic root is markedly dilated at the sinus level with
complete absence of the sinotubular junction. The ascending
aorta is markedly dilated with a large ascending arotic
aneurysm. The distal aspect cannot be appreciated, but the
aortic arch size appears normal at the mid and distal extent.
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. The
aortic valve is bicuspid. There is no aortic valve stenosis. The
aortic regurgitation vena contracta is >0.6cm. Severe (4+)
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears
structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. Trivial
mitral regurgitation is seen.

Post Bypass: Patient is a paced on phenylepherine infusion.
Biventricular function is normal. Aortic valve mechanical
prosthethesis insitu peak gradient 10, mean 5 mm Hg with cardiac
output 6.4 bp 104/60. No perivavlular leaks or aortic
insufficiency seen. Prosthetic graft material well positioned in
ascending aorta, aortic arch and descending aortic contours
intact. MR remains trace. Remaining exam is unchanged. All
findings discussed with surgeons at the time of the exam.
I certify that I was present for this procedure in compliance
with HCFA regulations.
