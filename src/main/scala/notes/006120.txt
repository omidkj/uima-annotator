Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1515**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest pain. Transfer from outside hospital with troponin leak
for cardiac revascularization.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac catheterization with drug eluting stents x2 to Left
anterior descending artery and right posterior descending
artery.


History of Present Illness:
  Mr. [**Known lastname 52383**] is a 58-year-old man with diabetes, obesity,
hyperlipidemia, presenting with several days of intermittent
chest pain. He is tranferred from [**Hospital **] Hospital.

  He is a Scout Leader and was trainging for a 70 mile hike that
was to take place later in the year in [**Country 29586**]. He carried
heavy packs both days last weekend in training. This went well.
However, on Thursday he had about one hour of chest pain - dull,
non-radiating, no sweating, no radiation, no anxiety, no nausea
- that occurred at rest. It reappeared late Saturday night after
he finished playing cards with his friends. The pain recurred
again on Sunday morning and presented to [**Hospital **] Hospital.

  When at [**Location (un) **], he was given nitrates with some pain relief.
He ruled in with Troponin of 1.76 and since Sunday has had
persistant chest pain rated from [**2113-12-4**] (down from initial
presenting pain of [**6-9**]), despite IV Ntg at 120mcg/min, heparin
gtt, integrillin gtt and intermittent Morphine. Per report, no
significant EKG changes. Troponin has trended down, and the
fourth set was 1.0 and CK's were flat. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 8579**] from [**Location (un) **]
requested CCU transfer today and plans to do a cath on pt
tomorrow a.m. Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] (covering CCU fellow) called Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 8579**] and discussed case and bed facilitator. Pt has a bed
boarding in the CVICU under CCU [**Doctor Last Name **] service, without passing
through the ED.

On review of systems:
(+) Chest pain, as above. Fever, myalgias, arthraligas after
returning from [**Last Name (un) **] walking several years ago, Rx w/
doxycycline.
(-) He denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous
thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery,
myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red
stools. He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors. He denies
exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other review of
systems were negative.

  Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain
at arrival, dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea,
orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

Cardiac Cath. [**2-27**]
------------------
BRIEF HISTORY:   The patient is a 58 year old man with past
medical
history of diabetes, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia, referred
for
cardiac catherization for evaluation of coronary artery disease.
 The
patient presented with a non-ST elevation MI to [**Hospital **]
hospital, and
was transferred for catheterization after an overnight stay in
the CCU.
The patient had been having persistent chest pain until the
morning of
catheterization, without significant elevations in his cardiac
biomarkers, and mild ST depressions on his ECG.

INDICATIONS FOR CATHETERIZATION:
Coronary artery disease, NSTEMI

PROCEDURE:
Right Heart Catheterization: was performed by percutaneous entry
of the
right femoral vein, using a 5 French pulmonary wedge pressure
catheter,
advanced to the PCW position through a 5 French introducing
sheath.
Cardiac output was measured by the Fick method.
Left Heart Catheterization: was performed by percutaneous entry
of the
right femoral artery, using a 5 French angled pigtail catheter,
advanced
to the left ventricle through a 5 French introducing sheath.
Coronary Angiography: was performed in multiple projections
using a 5
French JL4 and a 5 French JR4 catheter, with manual contrast
injections.
Left Ventriculography: was performed in the 30 degrees [**Doctor Last Name **]
projection,
using 45 ml of contrast injected at 15 ml/sec, through the
angled
pigtail catheter.
Percutaneous coronary revascularization was performed using
placement of
drug-eluting stent(s).
Percutaneous coronary revascularization of an additional vessel
was
performed using placement of drug-eluting stent(s).
Conscious Sedation:  was provided with appropriate monitoring
performed by
a member of the nursing staff.
