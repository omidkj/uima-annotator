bronchitis. He was recently diagnosed with bladder cancer on

prompting elevtive cath. His CR is 1.8, he is being admitted for
prehydration, cath in am with Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 7047**].

Pertinent Results:
[**2119-12-14**] Cath: 1.  Coronary angiography in this right dominant
system demonstrated severe, focal three vessel disease in a
dextrocardic heart. The LMCA had no angiographically apparent
disease.  The LAD had a hazy 70-80% stenosis in the mid-portion.
 The LCx had a 90% stenosis at the OM branch bifurcation.  The
RCA was subtotally occluded proximally with in-stent restenosis.
2.  Limited resting hemodynamics revealed a normal systemic
arterial blood pressure with a central aortic pressure of 127/56
mmHg.

[**2119-12-15**] Carotid U/S: Right ICA stenosis 40-59%. Left ICA stenosis
40-59%.

[**2119-12-15**] Vein mapping: Duplex evaluation was performed of both
lower extremity venous systems. On the right, the greater
saphenous vein is patent with diameters ranging from 0.18 to
0.30. Left greater saphenous vein has been harvest. The left
lesser saphenous vein is patent with diameters of 0.15 to 0.36.
The walls are thickened.

[**2119-12-15**] Chest CT: 1. Complete situs inversus. 2. Centrilobular
emphysema. Bronchial wall thickening, mild but diffuse. Findings
that might be consistent with COPD, clinical correlation is
advised. 3. Ground-glass opacity in the apex of the left lung
that potentially might represent infectious process but the
remote possibility of bronchoalveolar cancer cannot be entirely
excluded. Follow up in six months would be suggested. 4.
Coronary calcifications. Right coronary artery stent. 5.
Saber-sheath trachea that might be related to COPD. 6. Left
thyroid hypodense nodules. Correlation with thyroid ultrasound
is recommended.

[**2119-12-18**] Thyroid U/S: Multiple nodules seen throughout the
thyroid gland. All of the nodules by ultrasound criteria appear
to be either spongy nodules or colloid cysts and demonstrate no
worrisome features. A follow-up ultrasound in one year is
recommended to assess stability.

[**2119-12-19**] Echo: PREBYPASS: The patient has dextrocardia. No atrial
septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. Regional left ventricular
wall motion is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size
and free wall motion are normal. There are complex (>4mm)
atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. No aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+)
mitral regurgitation is seen.
POSTBYPASS: Biventricular systolic function remain preserved.
The study is otherwise unchanged from prebypass

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 27837**] [**Last Name (Titles) 1834**] a cardiac cath on [**12-14**] which revealed severe
coronary artery disease. Following cath he was admitted for
surgical work-up echo, vein mapping, chest and head CT, carotid
U/S and usual pre-op labs. Please see pertinent results for
results of those studies. He received medical management while
undergoing pre-op work-up and awaited Plavix washout. On [**2119-12-19**]
he was brought to the operating room where he [**Date Range 1834**] a
coronary artery bypass graft x 4. Pleas see operative report for
surgical details. Following surgery he was transferred to the
CVICU for invasive monitoring in stable condition. within 24
hours he was weaned from sedation, awoke neurologically intact
and extubated. Later that day he was weaned from sedation, awoke
neurologically and extubated. On post-op day one beta-blockers
and diuretics were started and he was gently diuresed towards
his pre-op weight. Later this day he was transferred to the
stepdown floor for further care. Chest tubes and epicardial
pacing wires were removed per protocol. He was started on Cipro
for +UTI for a total of 10 days. He made a good recovery post-op
with no complications and worked with physical therapy for
strength and mobility. On post-op day 4 he was discharged to
rehab (Bay Point in [**Hospital1 1474**]) with the appropriate medications
and follow-up appointments.
