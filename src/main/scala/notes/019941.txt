HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Patient is a pleasant
79-year-old man with a history of coronary artery disease
status post IMI x2 and PTCA of his RCA and left circumflex in
[**2137**] and stenting of the LAD in [**2138**], who presented to his
primary care provider on the day of admission for routine
physical exam.  EKG at that time prompted his primary care to
refer him for a cardiac catheterization.  Catheterization
performed on the day of admission revealed left main disease
and severe three-vessel disease with an EF of 30%.

Patient reports one month of gaseous sensations in his chest
not related to exertion.  Patient has also complained of
shoulder pain radiating to his chest while watching the Super
Bowl.  Otherwise, the patient denies any chest pain,
shortness of breath, diaphoresis, nausea, vomiting.  An
echocardiogram performed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], who is his primary
care provider at his office revealed inferior dyskinesis with
an EF of 45%.  No date was given for that echocardiogram.

dentition.  Neck is supple, no JVD, and no lymphadenopathy or
thyromegaly.  Chest was clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Cardiac:  Regular rate and rhythm, S1, S2 with no murmurs or
rubs.  Abdomen is soft, nontender, and nondistended,
normoactive bowel sounds, no masses.  Extremities are warm,
no edema, cyanosis, or clubbing, no varicosities.  Pulses:

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Patient was followed by the Medical service
for the first two days of his hospitalization, and on
[**3-19**], he was brought to the operating room.  Please
see the OR report for full details of the summary.  The
patient had coronary artery bypass grafting x3 with LIMA to
the LAD, saphenous vein graft to OM, saphenous vein graft to
the diag.  Patient tolerated the operation well.  He was
transferred from the operating room to the Cardiothoracic
Intensive Care Unit.

At the time of transfer, his mean arterial pressure was 74
with a CVP of 5.  He was in normal sinus rhythm at 90 beats
per minute with Epinephrine at 0.02 mcg/kg/minute and
propofol at 30 mcg/kg/minute.  He did well in the immediate
postoperative period.  His anesthesia was reversed.  He was
weaned from the ventilator and successfully extubated on the
day of surgery.  He was weaned from all cardioactive drugs,
and on postoperative day one, he remained hemodynamically
stable.  His mediastinal chest tubes and Swan-Ganz catheter
were removed.

On postoperative day two, the patient continued to be
hemodynamically stable.  The remainder of his chest tubes
were removed, and he was sent to [**Hospital Ward Name 121**] 2 for continuing
postoperative care and cardiac rehabilitation.

Over the next several days, the patient's activity level was
advanced with assistance with Physical Therapy and nursing
departments.  It was noted on postoperative day four that the
patient had short bursts of atrial fibrillation, which was
treated with increasing his beta blockade.  He again had a
short episode of atrial fibrillation with a ventricular
response of 140.  He remained hemodynamically stable
throughout that time.  At that time, he was loaded with
amiodarone and started on an oral regime.  Following the IV
load of amiodarone, the patient converted back into sinus
rhythm, and remained hemodynamically stable throughout the
remainder of his hospital stay.

On postoperative day five, it was decided that the patient
was stable and ready to be discharged home.  At that time his
physical exam is as follows:  Vital signs:  Temperature 99,
heart rate 73, sinus rhythm, blood pressure 114/73,
respiratory rate 20, and O2 saturation 94% on room air.
Weight preoperatively was 64 kg, at discharge is 60.9 kg.

Laboratory data:  White count 8.9, hematocrit 35.2, platelets
192.  Sodium 138, potassium 4.3, chloride 99, CO2 31, BUN 26,
creatinine 1.0, glucose 114.

Physical exam:  Alert and oriented times three, moves all
extremities, and follows commands.  Respiratory:  Clear to
auscultation bilaterally.  Cardiac:  Regular rate and rhythm,
S1, S2 with no murmurs.  Sternum is stable.  Incision was
Steri-Strips, open to air, clean and dry.  Abdomen is soft,
nontender, and nondistended with normoactive bowel sounds.
Extremities are warm and well perfused with no edema.  Left
lower extremity incision with Steri-Strips open to air clean
and dry.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1. Enteric coated aspirin 325 q.d.
2. Atorvastatin 20 q.d.
3. Metoprolol 75 mg t.i.d.
4. Flovent two puffs b.i.d.
5. ....... two puffs b.i.d.
6. Amiodarone 400 mg b.i.d. x1 week, then 400 mg q.d. x1
week, then 200 mg q.d.
7. Percocet 5/325 mg 1-2 tablets q.4h. prn.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1. Coronary artery disease status post coronary artery bypass
grafting x3 with a left internal mammary artery to the left
anterior descending artery, saphenous vein graft to obtuse
margin, and saphenous vein graft to diag.
2. Hypertension.
3. Hypercholesterolemia.
4. Asthma.
5. Benign prostatic hypertrophy status post transurethral
resection of the prostate.
6. Status post cataract surgery of the left eye.
7. Postoperative atrial fibrillation.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Good.

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:  He is to be discharged to home with
visiting nurses.

FOLLOW-UP INSTRUCTIONS:  His followup is here at the [**Hospital 409**]
Clinic in two weeks, with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in [**4-7**] weeks, and
