CXR:
[**2103-6-6**]: Pulmonary edema has markedly improved. Left lower lobe
opacity is unchanged, likely atelectasis. Cardiomediastinal
contours are unchanged. Right subclavian catheter remains in
place with tip in the standard position.  Multifocal right lung
opacities are unchanged. Bilateral pleural effusions are small,
associated with adjacent atelectasis. Patient is status post
esophagectomy.

Esophagus: [**2103-6-4**] Single-contrast upper GI series was
performed. Barium passes freely into the esophagus and at the
site of anastomosis. There is no evidence of a leak at this
site. Barium is pooled within the stomach. After 30 minutes, a
followup scout film and followup fluoroscopy image was taken,
which continued to show barium retained within the stomach with
little passing to the small intenstine.
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of anastomotic leak.
2. Delayed gastric emptying

MRI spine: [**2103-6-1**] IMPRESSION: No evidence of epidural abscess.
Mild disc protrusion at T10-T11 level with anterior thecal sac
indentation but no significant spinal canal narrowing or neural
foraminal compromise seen.

Chest/Pelvic CT [**2103-6-1**]: IMPRESSION:
1. Improving pleural effusion, pneumomediastinum and
pneumothorax as compared to previous study.
2. No evidence of pneumonic process/evidence of pneumonia.
3. No evidence of lymphadenopathy in the visualized areas.
4. All tubes and lines appear well placed
5. No obvious foci of infection.
6. Area of reduced perfusion in left lobe of liver may reflect
sequelae from retraction.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 97982**] was admitted [**2103-5-25**] following  [**First Name9 (NamePattern2) 12351**] [**Doctor Last Name **]
esophagectomy with intrathoracic esophagogastric anastomosis.
Laparoscopic jejunostomy feeding tube.Wrapping of intrathoracic
anastomosis with pericardial fat. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy.
Laparoscopic reduction of hiatal hernia. She was transfer to the
ICU extubated with an NGT, Foley and Epidural managed by the
acute pain service.  While in the SICU she required multiple
fluid challenges for hypotension.  Once hemodynamically stable
she transfer to the Floor on [**2103-5-29**].

Events:  [**2103-5-30**] developed respiratory distress (hypoxic)
requiring intubation and transfer to the ICU. Bedside
bronchoscopy was done [**2103-5-31**] with aspiration of sections and
bile.  An NGT was placed. Temp 102 Vancomycin and Zosyn started.
Over the next few days here respiratory status improved. She was
successfully extubated [**2103-6-1**]. Her oxygen requirements
improved with nebs, incentive spirometer. Oxygen saturations of
93-97% on 4L NC. CT was done showed no anastomic leak.

ID: she was seen by infectious disease. Cultures grew MSSA
continue coverage for GNR/anaerobes, can switch vancomycin to
Ampicillin/Sulbactam 3gm IV q6h x 14 days starting from
[**2103-5-31**].  Of note an MRI of the spine was negative of epidural
abscess following Epidural removal [**2103-5-30**].

Cardiovascular: Immediately postop was sinus tachycardia.  IV
Lopressor was started.  She was hypotensive which responded to
fluid bolus.  Once taking PO's her home dose diltiazem was
restarted.  Sinus rhythm 80-100's and blood pressure improved to
130's.  Lisinopril was titrated as an outpatient.

GI: NGT was removed POD 4 requring placment on [**2103-6-1**]
following aspiration event and removed [**2103-6-2**].  PPI and bowel
regime continued

Nutrition: Tube feeds Replete Full strength started POD increase
to Goal of 75 mL/18hrs. Following esophagus study [**2103-6-4**] full
liquid diet and will continue until seen by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **].
Aspiration precautions at all times.

Renal: Volume overload. She was gently diuresed with IV lasix
converted to PO lasix until at preop weight of 72 kg. Her renal
function remain normal with good urine output.  Her electrolytes
were replete as needed.

Endocrine: maintained on insulin sliding scale to keep blood
sugars < 150.  She will restart her PO diabetic medications upon
discharge.

Heme: Chronic anemia HCT stable 25-19

Dispo: Followed by physical therapy.  She was discharged to [**Hospital1 15454**] in [**Location (un) 701**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 40835**].  She will follow-up
with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] as an outpatient.
