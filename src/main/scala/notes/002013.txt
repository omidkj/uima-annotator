IMAGING:
[**3-4**]: CXR: Widened mediastinum with acute left fourth rib
fracture. No evidence of pneumothorax
[**3-4**] CT Head: large frontal subgaleal hematoma. no definite
intracranial bleed
[**3-4**] CT C spine: communited fx of the base of the C2 with
extension into b/l transverse foramen, mild posterior
retropulsion of C2 fx fragments and fracture of right C2 facet.
Nondisplaced fx of C3. Right C6 posterior element fracture. C7
burst fracture and loss of height with fracture line extending
into right C7 pars/ facet. possible epidural hematoma.
[**3-4**]: CT C/A/P: Multiple thoracic transverse process fractures.
T7 comminuted compression fx with fx extending into posterior
elements with minimal retropulsion. T8 mild compression fx. Left
4th, 5th rib fx. L2 loss of height. Renal mass measuring 2.4 x
2.4 cm concerning for RCC
[**3-4**]: UE X ray: both the right and left wrists demonstrate
intra-articular extension and impaction of comminuted distal
radius fractures with dorsal angulation and slight dorsal
displacement. Both also demonstrate ulnar styloid process
fractures. In addition there are suspected avulsion fractures of
the bilateral triquetral bones. The left humerus and shoulder
are grossly intact
[**3-4**]: LE X rays: No fracture or dislocation is evident. The
regional soft tissues are unremarkable
[**3-4**]: UE x ray post reduction: Improved alignment of distal
radial
fractures bilaterally. On the right, a large osseous fragment
lies along volar aspect of distal carpal row, donor site
unclear, possibly hamate fracture

Brief Hospital Course:
She was admitted to the Trauma service. Neurosurgery was
consulted for her spine fractures which were managed non
operatively. She was fitted for a TLSO brace with a cervical
extension; this is to be worn at all times. She will follow up
in 1 month in [**Hospital 4695**] clinic for repeat spine imaging. Her
neurologic status is intact, she moves all extremities but is
limited by pain.

these were closed reduced and casted. She may weight bear only
when using the platform walker, otherwise should not bear weight
on both wrists.

Her home medications were restarted, a regular diet was also
started for which initially she had a poor appetite. Marinol was
started and her appetite has since improved significantly.
