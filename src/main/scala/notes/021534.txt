Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 10842**]
Chief Complaint:
flank pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:

s/p Left percutaneous nephrostomy tube
s/p RIJ [**First Name3 (LF) 14938**] & LIJ [**First Name3 (LF) 14938**]

History of Present Illness:
72-year-old female with past medical history significant for
type II diabetes, dCHF, severe anemia [**3-15**] beta thalassemia trait
and myelodysplastic syndrome, HTN, asthma, and hyperlipidemia
who presents now to ED with 1 day left sided flank pain, fevers
and suspected pyelonephritis in setting of obstructive renal
stone. She initially denied any fevers/chills, but did report
nausea without vomiting. Of note patient has history of
pansensitive E.Coli UTI dating back to [**11/2184**] per OMR notes.
Urology workup from same timeframe included CT pelvis that
showed tiny stone in the left ureterovesical junction causing
mild left pelviectasis and delayed excretion from the left
kidney. Additional non-obstructing stones were also seen in the
left kidney as well.
.
In the ED, initial vs were: T [**Age over 90 **]F, PR 65, BP 146/48, RR 16, O2
saturation 100% RA . Patient was nauseous and given 2mg IV
Zofran x2, 4mg IV Morphine x1 for pain.  Her UA was hazy and
showed large amount blood, moderate leuks, few bacteria,
negative nitrites. was postive and was started on  1g IV
Ceftriaxone.  She had notable labs in ED for lactate 5.2, WBC
14.4 (60% neuts, 16% lymphs and 8 bands). HCT 28 / elevated from
baseline , and Cr 1.6 (recent baseline fluctuates between
1.3-1.8). She spiked fevers in ED to 104F range and given 650mg
Tylenol and 400mg ibuprofen,a right IJ placed for access.

After CT Abd/Pelvis revealed [**First Name9 (NamePattern2) 5692**] [**Location (un) 1131**] of hydronephrosis,
hydroureter and 0.4 mm left UVJ ureteral stone.  Urology was
consulted and considered placing a stent, but anesthesia felt
uncomfrotable intubating her and it was decided to proceed with
IR.  Additionally, urology recommended adding 80mg Gentamicin
and flomax.  The patient subsequently became hypotensive with
SBP high 70's and was started on levophed 0.06mcg/kg/min.  Vital
signs at the time of transfer to IR suite were: Temp 101.6 F, HR
78, BP 94/61, RR 22 99% 3L.
.
The patient was brought to the IR suite with SBP high 90's and
on 0.15mcg of levophed. INR was 2.2 so given 4 Units FFP,
recheck was 1.8 so given another 2 units FFP. Also given unit of
platelets, 2 unit PRBCs and 2 units cryoprecipitate in setting
of bleeding from IJ site and worse DIC labs. Urology placed a 5
french stent to help decompress patient via cystoscopy approach
to help stabilize her while awaiting IR nephrostomy placement. A
sample of pus from stent was sent off for culture. IR
successfully placed a left nephrostomy tube and then urology
removed temporary stent.
.
Initial vitals on arrival to ICU were: T 97.2F, HR 68, BP
140/60, and settings on A/C were Tv 450 x 18 RR, PEEP 5, Fi02
100%.  RR at 18.
.
She was still on Levophed pressor and was fully sedated and
intubated. A thrombin dressing was packed tightly over RIJ with
limited evidence of oozing BRB. Foley was removed and right
nephrostomy draining blood tinged urine.

cavity size and regional/global systolic function are normal
(LVEF >55%). There is no ventricular septal defect. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are
normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened

regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
