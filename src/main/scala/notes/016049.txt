CXR ([**9-16**]) -- 1) Right internal jugular central venous line with
tip at the superior vena cava/right atrial border. No
pneumothorax. 2) Mild congestive heart failure.

CT ([**9-20**]) -- IMPRESSION:
1) Stable right UPJ and left distal ureter stones. Right
nephrostomy tube
and no right hydronephrosis. 2) Extensive diverticulosis without
evidence of diverticulitis. 3) Cholelithiasis. 4) Cardiomegaly.
5) Bilateral pleural effusions. 6) Probable hepatic cysts.


Brief Hospital Course:
Pt was admitted on [**2152-9-15**] for the purpose of definitive
surgical management of a chronic L kidney failure 2nd to
ureteral calculi and L purulent perinephric psoas abcess.  The
planned L radical nephrectomy/ureterectomy was without
complication or finding necessitating a change in the
pre-operative diagnosis, but given her fragile health, large
fluid shift and the 800cc of EBL (addressed with 3U PRBC) she
was maintained in the PACU overnight.  R nephrostomy tube
remained in place and General Surgery was present during the
case to assist with the lysis of extensive adheions of the
abcess to surrounding structures.  On POD#1, it was decided to
wean her off the vent (SIMV), and she was taken to the SICU for
immediate post-operative period.  She was given a 24 hour course
of Vanco, and started on 7 days of Ceftazidine.  She was
sucessfully extubated on POD#2.  However at this same time, she
was noted to be in A-Fib with an inappropriate pacemaker
response and EP was consulted for a question of the PM failure
to capture.  The pacemaker was interrogated on [**9-17**] and its
setting reprogrammed to VV1 60. Wide complex V-tach was noted on
[**9-18**] and runs of NSVT were noted on [**9-20**].  EP again interrogated
the PM and considered it functioning well, but her digoxin level
was 1.2-1.4, above the optimum 0.8 which they felt could have
been contributing to ventricular irritability.  Thus her out-pt
digoxin dose was halves in compensate for her change in renal
fxn.  Similarly, lisinopril was also stopped post-operatively.
On POD#3, pt was cleared by a Speech and Swallow Eval.  Pt was
transferred to 12Reisman and out of the SICU on POD#4, with
telemetry and a sitter.  Chest tube was removed on POD#3, which
was place as per standard procedure for a thoracoabdominal
incision.  She was advance to a regular diet on POD#5, and
restarted on her home dose of warfarin.  Throughout the
post-operative period until they were removed on POD#7, her 2 JP
drains put out >100cc of serosanguinous fluid each.  Sitter was
d/c'ed on POD#8 without incident; pt remained agitated but
cooperative.  Pt was ready for discharge on POD#7, but could not
be discharged due to a sitter being involved in the pt's care.
On POD#10, pt had been without sitter for >24 hours without
incident, and had notably come back negative for both VRE and
MRSA.
