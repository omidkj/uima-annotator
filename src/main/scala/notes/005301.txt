Service: CARDIOTHORACIC

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 165**]
Chief Complaint:
Syncope

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2163-10-7**] Redo-Sternotomy, Aortic Valve Replacement, Coronary
Artery Bypass Graft x 2 (SVG to PDA, SVG to LIMA)

History of Present Illness:
This is a 68-year-old male patient known to [**Hospital1 18**] with a history
of severe AS; CAD, s/p CABG in [**2160**] (LIMA-LAD, SVG-LAD, SVG-OM);
stent to LMCA and stent to Diag 1 in [**2160**]; PCI to SCG-LAD; ISR
of D1 stent in [**2161**]; and s/p Cypher stent to LMCA in [**2162**]. He is
also a diabetic, has PVD, HTN, CRI, hypothyroidism, CHF, EF
40-50%, Gout, sleep apnea, and a history of GI bleed from AVMs.
He presented OSH today with two episodes of syncope. He reports
walking to the door to let out his dog at 5 am and passed out.
Woke up on the floor. + LOC. Then, syncopized a second time,
witnessed by son, about 2-3 hours later. This occurred when
walking to the car. Felt "clammy", also had N/V once at the
hospital. No post fall confusion. No jerking movements, no
incontinence. He hit head posteriorly ?anteriorly also.
He has lacerations on his forehead but required no stitches. CT
head at OSH reportedly normal per patient (report not available
at this time). His blood sugar was greater than 400 on arrival.
He was give Lantus and regular insulin, Zofran and because his
lungs were diminished at the bases and he is chronically short
of breath he was given a nebulizer treatment. He also underwent
an echocardiogram with the results still pending. He was given
Morphine for chest pain with relief.
He reports chronic "congestive" chest pain; with questioning
this did not seem to be any worse than his baseline today. Also
dyspneic with exertion chronically. Also reports heaviness in
his calves and legs that limit his exercise tolerance.
The few days PTA he attended a day program at [**Last Name (un) **] for
improvement in his glucose control. He felt well until one day
PTA when he began to feel lightheaded and fatigues despite
normal glucose. Also recently had vitrectomy/eye surgery (1.5
weeks ago). Also thought he was starting a gout flare of R foot;
took PO prednisone last night to start a taper. ROS negative
other than listed above.

-- CKD- with baseline Cr 1.5-2.0
-- hypercholesterolemia
-- OA
-- Gout
-- IBS-diarrhea predominant
-- Obesity
-- PVD
-- UGI and LGI bleeding secondary to AVMs


Social History:
Social history is significant for the absence of current tobacco
use. There is no history of alcohol abuse. Retired [**Doctor Last Name **].
Widowed in [**2163-1-3**].

Family History:
There is no family history of premature coronary artery disease
or sudden death.

Physical Exam:
VS - T97.5, BP 128/56, P97, R20, 96% on 2L
Gen: NAD. Oriented x3. Mood, affect appropriate.
HEENT: NCAT. Sclera anicteric. PERRL. Conjunctiva pink, MMM, OP
clear.
Neck: Supple, no noted JVP elevation. Murmur radiation into
carotids.
CV: RR, normal S1, S2. Loud AS murmur heard throughout the
precordium with radiation to the carotids.
Chest: No chest wall deformities, scoliosis or kyphosis. Resp
were unlabored. + bibasilar crackles.
Abd: Soft, NTND. No HSM or tenderness.
Ext: Trace edema bilat.
Skin: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas

Pertinent Results:
[**10-4**] CNIS: There is less than 40% right ICA stenosis and there
is 40-59 left ICA stenosis. There is a greater than 50% left ECA
stenosis as well, and both vertebral arteries are unable to be
visualized.
[**10-7**] Echo: PRE-CPB: The left atrium is mildly dilated. No
spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body of the left
atrium. No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the left atrial
appendage. No thrombus is seen in the left atrial appendage. No
atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is
mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. There is moderate regional
left ventricular systolic dysfunction with severe inferior
hypokinesis. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
moderately depressed (LVEF= 35 %). Transmitral Doppler and
tissue velocity imaging are consistent with Grade II (moderate)
LV diastolic dysfunction. Right ventricular chamber size and
free wall motion are normal. There are simple atheroma in the
aortic root. There are simple atheroma in the ascending aorta.
There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch. There are simple
atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. There are three
aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately
thickened. No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic
valve. There is severe aortic valve stenosis (area <0.8cm2).
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. Addendum: Episode of increased PA pressures during
exposure of coronary bypass grafts with apical akinesis. No
change in bp, CO or mixed venous. Nitroglycerine started and
patient put on cardiopulmonary bypass within minutes. POST-CPB:
On infusions of epi, levo, milrinone, amiodarone, insulin.
Well-seated bioprosthetic valve in the aortic position. No
paravalvular leak. MR is 3+ with ventricular dilation, improved
with IABP insertion. LVEF now 35%. Inferoseptal, apical and
inferior hypokinesis. IABP in good position 3 cm below LSCA.
Aortic contour is normal post decannulation.
RADIOLOGY  Final Report

CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2163-10-12**] 1:33 PM

CHEST (PA & LAT)

Reason: evaluate for effusion with sternal drainage

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
68 year old man s/p avr cabg x2
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
evaluate for effusion with sternal drainage
INDICATION: Evaluate for effusion, with sternal drainage.

COMPARISONS: Chest radiograph dated [**2163-10-10**].

FINDINGS: Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.
Sternotomy wires and mediastinal clips remain. A cardiac valve
prosthesis is noted. A right internal jugular catheter
terminates at the cavoatrial junction. There is mild blunting of
both posterior costophrenic angles, with associated decreased
retrocardiac opacity. There is no pneumothorax. The cardiac
silhouette is stable and enlarged. There is no pulmonary
vascular congestion.

IMPRESSION: Small bilateral pleural effusions with decreased
retrocardiac atelectasis.

The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

Brief Hospital Course:
As mentioned in the HPI, Mr. [**Known lastname 21147**] was transferred to OSH
following two syncopal episodes. Upon admission he was
appropriately worked up and medically managed until cleared for
surgery. Finally on [**10-7**] he was brought to the operating room
where he underwent a redo-sternotomy, aortic valve replacement
and coronary artery bypass graft x 2. Please
