History of Present Illness:
EVENTS / HISTORY OF PRESENTING ILLNESS:
75 M h/o CAD s/p PCI x 2, EF=45%, in his USOH until 6pm while
eating dinner, when he developed acute onset SSCP "15/10"
non-radiating, no associated sob, diaphoresis/n/v. He describes
as central chest pressure, similar to his MI in [**2095**]. He felt it
may be [**3-11**] his dinner, and induced vomiting with mild releif. He
took nitro spray x3 with some benefit also ([**7-18**] pain).
.
EMS was activated, and after receiving amio bolus + drip, was
apparently with 2/10 chest pain though per EMS remained in
stable VT.
.
On arrival to [**Hospital1 18**] ED, VS=97.6 164 90/p 22 97%. His chest pain
apparently persisted, [**3-19**], though per pt did not worsen. BP
119/86, pt given versed 2mg and shocked @ 100J x 1 though was
apparently hemodynamically stable throughout, after which he
converted to NSR. He was then noted to be lethargic and sats
100%NRB, though subsequently became more arousable. He also
received 1L IVF NS and amio 150mg iv x 1. He was seen by
cardiology, who recommended switching to lidocaine gtt.
Post-cardioversion EKG was concerning for STD V2-4, thus pt was
loaded with plavix 600mg, heparin gtt, integrellin gtt, and
admitted to CCU in anticipation of cath in AM.
.
.
Of note, pt has stable central chest pressures which occurs
after walking [**2-11**] miles, and is releived by 1 SL NTG. Has
episodes 2-3x/wk, never at rest, worse after drinking coffee.
.
.
+ h/o stroke [**2116**] (etiology unclear, denies "embolism"), dark
stools (h/o UC, none in past 5 yrs).
.
On review of symptoms, he denies any prior history of TIA, deep
venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of
surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis. He denies
recent fevers, chills or rigors. He denies exertional buttock or
calf pain. All of the other review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,
ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

ECHO [**2124-2-24**]
The left atrium is normal in size. The left atrium is elongated.
The estimated right atrial pressure is 0-5 mmHg. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
There is mild to moderate regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction with severe hypokinesis/akinesis of the inferior and
inferolateral walls. Right ventricular chamber size and free
wall motion are normal. The aortic valve is bicuspid. The aortic
valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is moderate
aortic valve stenosis (area 1.2cm2). The mitral valve leaflets
are mildly thickened. Mild to moderate ([**2-9**]+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is borderline pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. Significant pulmonic regurgitation is
seen. There is no pericardial effusion.
.
Cardiac CATH [**2124-2-21**]
COMMENTS:
1. Selective angiography in this right dominant system revealed
one
vessel CAD. The LMCA was calcified but free of angiographically
apparent
obstructive CAD. The LAD had proximal 20% stenosis and 50% mid
vessel.
The LCX had moderate calcification and was proximally occluded.
The RCA
had minimal luminal irregularities, diffuse disease and serial
30-50%
stenoses.
2. Resting hemodynamics revealed normal right sided and elevated
left
sided filling pressures with RVEDP of 6 mmHg and LVEDP of 15
mmHg.
There was elevated systemic blood pressure with SBP of 143 mmHg.
Cardiac
index was preserved at 2.75 l/min/m2.
3. There was mild aortic stenosis with mean gradient of 16.55
mmHg and
calculated aortic valve area of 1.36 cm2.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. One vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Mild aortic stenosis.


Brief Hospital Course:
.
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN, TO BE REVIEWED AND DISCUSSED IN
MULTIDISCIPLINARY ROUNDS:
.
75M h/o CAD, s/p PCI, EF=45%, presenting with stable VT s/p
external shock x 1 with conversion to NSR, with ?STD on
post-cardioversion EKG.
.
# CAD/Ischemia: baseline stable angina, unchanged over past [**3-12**]
yrs, post-cardioversion EKG with STD in V2-5, and ?horizontal
STE in III, aVF. CP. Taken to cath lab which showed diffuse dx
and TO to LCX but no intervention was performed. Recommended
medical management. Patient was continued on aspirin, statin and
Betablocker and ACE inhibitor were titrated as blood pressure
tolerated. Electrolytes were repleted aggressively. Not started
on plavix as no intervention was performed.  Patient remained
chest pain free for duration of stay.
.
# Pump: Repeat ECHO on this admission demonstrated persistent
hypokinesis of inferior walls with EF 45%, unchanged from prior.
Treated with ACE inhibitor for afterload reduction. No need for
diuresis as currently was not in decompensated heart failure.
.
# Rhythm: S/p VT ablation. 4 areas of inducible VT were noted.Pt
had CP during VT underwent cardiac catheterization that showed
TO of LCX but no lesion to intervene upon. The following day
second EP study was performed. Several endocardial ablations
were completed. 1 VT was induced and patient became hypotensive
requiring external shock and pressors for short time. Not all
foci could be ablated. Patient monitored on telemetry with no
further episodes of VT. Did have occasional PVCs.
.
# Valves: Bicuspid aortic valve. Moderate AV stenosis [**Location (un) 109**] 1.2cm
noted on ECHO, worse since prior study in [**2122**].
