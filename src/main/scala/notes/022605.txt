IMPRESSION:  This is a 42 year old male call out from the
Intensive Care Unit after intentional TCA overdose, no

HOSPITAL COURSE (SINCE DISCHARGE FROM THE INTENSIVE CARE UNIT
TO THE FLOOR):
1.  TOXICOLOGY:  The QRS remained narrow on the floor for
over two days (QRS less than 100).  There were no events on
Telemetry and it was discontinued on [**11-9**].  His
electrolytes were aggressively repleted and normalized by
[**11-9**].   From a cardiac standpoint he was stable for
discharge to a psychiatric facility on [**11-9**], however,
patient was unable to void, likely secondary to
anti-cholinergic side effects of his TCA overdose.

He was straight cathed on the night of [**11-8**] with a
total residual urine of 1,600 cc.  At that time, his Foley
was replaced.  On the morning of [**11-9**], the Foley was
removed and we began a trial of bethanechol, 10 mg q. one
hour times five until the patient voids.  At the time of this
discharge summary, the patient had not yet voided and had
just received his third dose.  Please see the discharge
addendum.

The patient was unable to transfer to Psychiatry from a
psychiatric standpoint until he voids, however, he is
medically stable for transfer.

2.  HEMATOLOGIC:  Deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis with
subcutaneous heparin.

3.  INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  A CD4 count was 355.  Viral load was
pending at the time of this dictation.  There was no need to
start HAART or prophylaxis at this time.  [**Month (only) 116**] want to
consider starting HAART treatment in the future once the
acute psychiatric issues have resolved if the patient can
adhere to this treatment.

He received topical Kenalog for oral hairy leukoplakia.

Treatment was initiated with Levofloxacin for a fever, cough
and a question of a right lower lobe consolidation (on chest
x-ray, atelectasis versus consolidation) on [**11-7**].  The
patient improved by [**11-9**] on Levaquin and should
complete a seven day course for bronchitis versus question of
pneumonia.

4.  PSYCHIATRIC:  Psychiatry continued to follow the patient
on the floor for ongoing issues of depression, sleep
disturbance and status post overdose.  He was restarted on
Prozac 10 q. a.m. and Seroquel 25 q. h.s. on [**11-8**].  The
one-to-one sitter was continued throughout this admission.
The patient is to be transferred to an inpatient psychiatric
unit from here.
