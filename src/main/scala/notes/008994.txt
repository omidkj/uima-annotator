History of Present Illness:
39 yo male with history of IDDM, HTN, [**Hospital 85819**] transferred from [**Hospital 64110**] for cardiogenic shock.  Per the patient's family,
he was experiencing "flulike" symptoms for the past 5 days
including nausea, weakness, and low grade fevers.  He reported
orthopnea and nausea with lying flat to his fiance.  Today, he
felt worsening dyspnea and chest pain, so called EMS.  The
patient was found by EMS to be ashen, diaphoretic, dyspneic and
near syncopal.
.
Initial vitals at OSH: Afebrile, HR 74, RR 24, BP 117/77 92% on
100 BiPAP. EKG revealed lateral ST depressions (I, aVL, V5-V6)
and ST elevation in III, q waves in III but not III or AvF.
Stat echo with EF of 30% distal septal, apical and
anterior/lateral wall akinesis with evidence of LV thrombus,
mild MR, mild TR.  His labs were significant for ABG of
7.36/31/46/17.5 (on BiPAP), WBC 18.3, Hct 34.5, Lactic acid 3.8,
Crn 3.8, Trop I 3.85.  CXR revealed bilateral nonspecific
airspace disease with likely consolidation of the left middle
lobe.  He was given lasix 40mg IV, levophed drip, zosyn 3.375mg,
vancomycin 1gm, ASA 325mg, and heparin drip.  PICC was placed.
Cardiology was [**Name (NI) 653**], and he was planned to be admitted to
the CCU.  However, as he decompensated on BiPAP PaO2 in 40s, he
was intubated with PEEP 10 and 100% with a PAO2 in the 70-80's.
He was sedated with versed and fentanyl on transfer via
[**Location (un) **].
.
On arrival to the cath lab, the patient was significantly
hypoxic to the low 80s.  FiO2 maintained at 100% and increased
PEEP to 14, however ABG revealed persistent hypoxia with PO2 of
63-66. An IABP was placed with marginal improvement in
hemodynamics and oxygenation. Left heart cath revealed LMCA no
CAD, LAD diffuse disease with prox ulcerated 90% and distal 70%,
LCx prox 80%, occluded OM1, OM2 60% prox, TO prox RCA with
collaterals from the left.  He received three BMS, one to LAD,
one to LCx and one to OM1.  He received a total of 200mg IV
lasix with appropriate urine output, 600mg PO plavix, 10units of
regular insulin.  As the patient's oxygen saturation did not
improve with IABP and intervention, TandemHeart was placed.  His
oxygenation and PCWP (39-22) improved dramatically after this
intervention.  He was maintained on levophed and dobutamine.
Levophed was discontinued prior to transfer.
.
ROS could not be obtained as patient is intubated. As per OSH
records: positive for nausea, vomiting, weakness, decreasing
appetite, some chest pressure.

ECHO [**2124-12-6**]:Overall left ventricular systolic function is
severely depressed (LVEF= 15-20 %). A left ventricular
mass/thrombus cannot be excluded. Right ventricular chamber size
and free wall motion are normal. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate [2+]
tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. Compared with the prior s
