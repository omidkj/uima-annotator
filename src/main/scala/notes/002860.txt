Final Report:
Following removal of endotracheal tube and pleural drains and a
Swan-Ganz
catheter, moderate right pleural effusion is larger, severe left
lower lobe atelectasis and small left pleural effusion are
stable, large cardiac
silhouette is unchanged and there is no appreciable mediastinal
vascular
engorgement. There is no pulmonary edema or pneumothorax. Right
jugular line ends above the origin of the right brachiocephalic
vein.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Dilated RA.
LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thickness. Severely dilated LV

likely depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]

ascending aorta diameter. Normal aortic arch diameter. Normal
descending aorta diameter.

regulations. The patient was under general anesthesia throughout
the procedure. No TEE related complications. Resting tachycardia
(HR>100bpm). The rhythm appears to be atrial fibrillation.
patient.
Conclusions
Prebypass
The left atrium is dilated. The coronary sinus is dilated. The
right atrium is dilated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are
normal. The left ventricular cavity is severely dilated. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 50
%). [Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more
depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.] Right
ventricular chamber size is normal with mild global free wall
hypokinesis. The mitral valve leaflets are moderately thickened
and myxomatous. There is posterior mitral leaflet flail
involving primarily the P2 scallop. The mitral valve leaflets do
not fully coapt. An eccentric, anteriorly directed jet of severe
(4+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Due to the eccentric nature
of the regurgitant jet, its severity may be significantly
underestimated (Coanda effect). The tricuspid valve leaflets are
mildly thickened with mild tricuspid regurgitation. The degree
of tricuspid regurgitation did not increase in severity despite
administration of 1.5 Liters of crystalloid, giving a pressor to
increase afterload, and placing the patient in a Trendelenburg
position. There is no pericardial effusion.
Postbypass
The patient is in atrial fibrillation on an epinephrine
infusion. There is a new annuloplasty ring in the mitral
position. It appears well-seated. There is now only trace mitral
regurgitation. Gradients across the valve at a cardiac output of
6.5 L/min are peak/mean of [**10-17**] mmHg. Biventricular systolic
function appears unchanged. Tricuspid regurgitation is now
trace. The thoracic aorta is intact post decannulation.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr [**Known lastname 3315**] was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] for surgical repair of mitral
regurgitation on [**3-17**] by Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **]. Please see the operative
report for details, in summary he had:
Mitral valve repair with a quadrangular resection of the middle
scallop of the posterior leaflet (P2), and the mitral valve
annuloplasty with a 32-mm Physio
II annuloplasty ring. He tolerated the operation well and was
transferred from the operating room to the cardiac surgery ICU
in stable condition. He was hemodynamically stable in the
immediate post-operative period anesthesia was reversed he awoke
neurologically intact and he was extubated. He remained stable
and was transferred to the stepdown floor on POD1.
All tubes, lines, and drains were removed per cardiac surgery
protocol. Once on the stepdown floor he worked with physical
therapy to increase his strength and endurance. He remained in
atrial fibrillation and his coumadin was resumed.
The remainder of his post-operative course was uneventful. On
POD4 he was discharged home with visiting nurses. INR level and
Coumadin dosing will be followed by [**Unive
