History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a [**Age over 90 **]-year-old gentleman with history of
[**Last Name (un) 3562**] Disease, several aspiration events, multiple
admissions for respiratory distress who was sent from [**Hospital 100**]
rehab for evaluation after being found unresponsive at 3 PM. Per
report, patient was found to open eyes but otherwise not
responding to verbal commands. ABG done at rehab showed marked
hypercarbia (pCO2 100) and patient was referred urgently to the
ED.
.
In the Emergency Department, patient was intubated for presumed
hypercarbic respiratory failure. ABG was not done on admission.
CXR did not show any acute changes from ED visit 3 days prior
(he had presented to ED on [**2142-7-10**] with dyspnea, respiratory
status had returned to baseline, CXR was unchanged, and labs did
not reveal leukocytosis). He was given Vanc/Levo/Flagyl for
possible sepsis, albuterol/atrovent for bronchodilation, and
methylprednisolone for ? assumed COPD exacerbation given
hypercarbia.
.
In discussing history and events with wife, she noted that
patient appeared more lethargic than normal today, with some
confusion. At baseline, patient is AO x 2, occasionally
disoriented to place and sundowns at night, but otherwise is
able to carry on normal daily conversations with her. During
prior hypercarbic episodes, wife reported that patient's speech
becomes softer and non-sensical, which she reported was
occurring throughout the day today. At 3 PM, she reports that
patient became very somnolent, and she sought immediate

Pertinent Results:
IMAGING: Head CT [**7-13**]:
FINDINGS: There is no acute intracranial hemorrhage, mass
effect, shift of the normally midline structures or
hydrocephalus. No major vascular territorial infarct is
identified. There is prominence of the ventricles and sulci
consistent with age-related involutional change. Mild
periventricular and subcortical white matter hypodensity is
consistent with microvascular ischemia. No fractures are
identified. The visualized paranasal sinuses are unremarkable.

IMPRESSION: No intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect.
.
Admission chest x-ray:
AP SUPINE CHEST: Tip of an endotracheal tube terminates 5 cm
above the carina. The tube could be advanced 2 cm for optimal
placement. A nasogastric tube courses to the stomach, tip off
the inferior margin of the radiograph. The cardiomediastinal
silhouette is stable. Calcified lymphadenopathy within the
mediastinum is also unchanged. There is persistent bibasilar
atelectasis, left greater than right. No pneumothorax or pleural
effusion is seen. The pulmonary vasculature is not congested.

IMPRESSION: ETT just below the thoracic inlet. The tube could be
advanced 2 cm for optimal placemtent. Persistent bibasilar
atelectasis.

CXR: [**7-15**]:
IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**5-29**] through [**7-14**]:

Atelectasis at the base of the left lung has improved. Small
left pleural effusion persists. Right lung is clear. Heart size
top normal. ET tube is in standard placement, although the cuff
is highlighted by retained secretions pooling in the trachea,
while a nasogastric tube passes into the stomach and out of
view. No pneumothorax.
.
[**7-16**] EGD:
Findings: Stomach:
-Other: The old [**Month/Year (2) 282**] was removed and a 24 Fr new [**Month/Year (2) 282**] placed
endoscopically. Pt tolerated procedure without any
complications.
Impression: The old [**Month/Year (2) 282**] was removed and a 24 Fr new [**Month/Year (2) 282**] placed
endoscopically. Pt tolerated procedure without any
complications.
Otherwise normal EGD to second part of the duodenum
Recommendations: 1. OK to use [**Month/Year (2) 282**] for meds/ feedings right now.
