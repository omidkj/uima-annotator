Service:  TRAUMA

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 52 year old
white male who presented as a trauma alert, status post fall
from a flight of stairs.  The patient was intubated at the
scene and came in with a GCS of 3.  The patient underwent CAT
scan of his head as well as cervical spine, abdomen and
pelvis.  CAT scan of the head remarkably was negative.
Cervical spine showed a C2 dense fracture that was displaced.
The patient's CAT scan of his abdomen and pelvis on arrival
was also negative.  Chest x-ray was also within normal
limits.  His pelvis x-ray was also within normal limits.  The
patient was subsequently admitted to the Surgical Intensive
Care Unit for further management.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  On [**2166-11-14**], the patient underwent anterior
fixation of his C2 dense fracture.  Postoperatively, the
patient did well and on [**2166-11-15**], the patient was extubated.
His residual neurologic function includes movement in his
right upper extremity as well as right lower extremity,
however, his left extremity, upper as well as lower, had
absolutely no function neurologically.

His Intensive Care Unit course was a complicated one.  The
patient required reintubation on [**2166-11-17**], for respiratory
distress.  At that time, sputum cultures as well as blood
cultures and urine cultures were sent for temperature of up
to 101.  Those cultures came back positive for Methicillin
resistant Staphylococcus aureus in his sputum for which the
patient was placed on Vancomycin.

Moreover on [**2166-11-21**], the patient's mother who at that time
believed to have health care for this patient made the
patient "Do Not Resuscitate".  In early [**Month (only) 1096**], the patient
was mentating well and was able to nod to simple questions
and interact to a minimal degree.

On [**2166-11-28**], the family agreed to a tracheostomy after which
the patient's mentation improved even more where he was able
to interact with nursing staff, able to ask for things as
well as answering more complex questions.  On [**2166-12-3**], the
patient received a gastrostomy tube per interventional
radiology.  Tube feed was then restarted two days later for
which the patient tolerated without any difficulty.

Also rescan of the patient's neck noted that his initial
repair of his C2 fracture required revision.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 363**] of
orthopedics took the patient back to the operating room on
[**2166-12-4**], and the patient underwent a revision of his C2
fracture fixation.

Postoperatively, the patient did well.  It was noted,
however, that the wound had some serous drainage.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 363**]
evaluated the wound and determined that the drainage was not
cerebrospinal fluid and that the patient should be able to
recover nicely without further intervention.

On discharge, the patient is in stable condition.  The
patient's wound is healing well.  His serous drainage is
minimal and the patient received a full fourteen days of
Vancomycin for his Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus
aureus.  He has remained afebrile for the last week.

By systems, neurologically, the patient is stable.  His wound
is healing well as mentioned and neurologically, he is able
to interact, however, he is unable to talk secondary to his
tracheostomy.

Cardiovascularly, he is hemodynamically stable.  He is on
Lopressor.  Respiratory wise, currently he is on a weaning
protocol.  He has been off the ventilator for as much as six
hours without any problems, resting only at night.

We will try keeping the patient off the ventilator for 24
hours to see how he does.

Gastrointestinal - The patient is tolerating tube feeds which
is ProMod with fiber at 80 cc per hour which is his goal.  He
has gastrostomy tube without any problems.

Genitourinary - The patient is making good urine output with
a stable creatinine.

Infectious disease - The patient is receiving fourteen days
of Vancomycin for his Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus
aureus in the sputum and prophylactically, the patient is
receiving Lovenox for deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis as
well as Venodyne boots.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
1.  Lotrimin 1% cream b.i.d. applied to feet.
2.  Zoloft 50 mg per gastrostomy tube q.d.
3.  Lopressor 50 mg per gastrostomy tube b.i.d.
4.  Vancomycin one gram intravenous q12hours.  He requires
two more days for completion of his fourteen day course.
5.  Ferrous Sulfate 325 mg per gastrostomy tube t.i.d.
6.  Lovenox 30 mg subcutaneous b.i.d.
7.  Diamox discontinued.
8.  Prevacid 30 mg per gastrostomy tube q.d.
9.  Dulcolax one tablet PR p.r.n.
10. Combivent two to four puffs q.i.d. p.r.n.
11. Miconazole Powder to affected areas.

In summary, the patient is a 52 year old status post fall
from stairs with C2 dense fracture, status post repair and
fixation and revision of that fixation, now getting
discharged in stable condition.
