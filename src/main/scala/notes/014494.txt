Chief Complaint:
Large B Cell Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
61 y/o F w/ diffuse B cell lymphoma, s/p high-dose chemotherapy
with autologous stem cell rescue in [**2195-4-4**] with relapse of
disease.  Here for MUD Nonmyeloblative Allogeneic Stem Cell
Transplantation.

**Patient was noted to become more hypoxic and required
increased O2 requirement during the day. She was noted to be
hypersomnolent during the day. BMT moonlighter was notified of
status around 8pm, (VS p 90s SBP 90s O2 low 90s on [**5-10**] L o2) who
felt she was wet on exam and she was given 40 IV lasix with some
effect in terms of urine outpt, but her respiratory status
continued to deteriorate and ABG was hypoxic 7/43/40s/60s, CXR
w/ diffuse pulmonary infiltrate. lasix 80 x 1 was given around
11pm for concern of pulmonary edema and ?frothy pink production.
ICU evaluation was called at 2am. Pt was found to have P 90s SBP
80s, R 30s (chronic all day), low 90s on NRB. She was
non-responsive. Patient family was informed of impending need
for intubation. Pt family consented for intubation. Intubation
was started and she became hypotensive to 60s/30s and acute
became asystolic. COde was called. She was started on CPR and 1
mg epi was given. Asytole changed to PEA. . 1 mg epi was given.
SHe was also given 1 amp Ca gluc for low ca from lab before.
Then, it changed to V Fib, she was shocked once and her pulse
returned to 160s BP 90-100. Her BP was drifting down and was
started on levophed. Her EKG was notable for sinus tachycardia.
Her VS stabilized at P 130s SBP 110-120s and then she was
transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**]. SHe received A-line, 1L fluid bolus,
started on propofol for agitation and continued on levophed and
her antibiotics was changed to
linezolid/zosyn/foscarnet/caspofungin to optimize possible VRE
infection. Her CXR at [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] s/p intubation showed nl heart size
and diffuse, somethwat improved opacitiy but no focal
infiltrate.
..
She was diagnosed in [**2194-11-3**] after routine CBC.  A CT scan
of the abdomen and pelvis showed a large mass in the left upper
quadrant with numerous enlarged celiac, porta hepatis, splenic
and hilar lymph nodes. A fine needle aspirate of the
retroperitoneal lymph node unfortunately was nondiagnostic and
she underwent a bone marrow biopsy and retroperitoneal lymph
node biopsy which did prove positive for diffuse large B-cell
non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.  She was treated with 6 cycles of R-CHOP
resulting in a CR, followed by high-dose chemotherapy and
autologous stem cell rescue in [**2195-4-4**].  She relapsed with
disease in her spleen and underwent a splenectomy in [**Month (only) 359**]
[**2194**].  She received [**Hospital1 **] with rituximab x 6 cycles, and one
cycle of Zevalin.

[**2196-3-4**] PET scan showed an interval increase in the size of
the left upper quadrant mass measuring 2.3 x 5 cm when compared
to 1.1 x 2.8 cm.  There was
also an increase in the size of the left diaphragmatic lymph
nodes.  She received a combination of gemcitabine and cisplatin
x1 and then underwent radiation therapy, completed on
[**2196-5-6**].  [**2196-5-9**] underwent a CT scan on a which showed no
evidence for adenopathy, particularly in the retroperitoneum at
sites of her prior disease.  A new right upper lobe opacity was
noted.  Her chemotherapies have been fairly well tolerated --
she has not had febrile neutropenia, line infections or
nausea/vomiting/ diarrhea.

She denies fevers, chills, night sweats, sinsus congestion,
cough, chest pain, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, urinary sx,
gyn sx, neurologic changes.

Past Medical History:
Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma:
The pt. was initially diagnosed with diffuse large B-cell
lymphoma in [**2194-11-3**] and was treated with R-CHOP for a
total of six cycles, which resulted in complete remission.  This
was followed by an autologous bone marrow transplant as
consolidation treatment in [**2195-4-4**]. She relapsed in the spleen
in [**2195-9-4**] and underwent plenectomy. Patien then had three
cycles of [**Hospital1 **]-R, one cycle of ESHAP-R, and Zevalin. She was
planned to undergo a non- ablative matched unrelated donor stem
cell transplant.

The PET CT that she had [**3-28**] showed an interval increase in the
size of the left upper quadrant mass which now measures 2.3 x 5
cm compared to 1.1 x 2.8 cm.  There was also an increase in the
size of the left diaphragmatic lymph node which now measures
nine millimeters. Therefore it was decided that the patient
would undergo more chemo with combination of gemcitabine at 1.5
grams per meters squared on day one and eight every three weeks
with cisplatin at 50 mg per meters squared on day one and eight.
Has now finished cycle 1 of  Gemzar/Cisplatin (last chemo was
[**4-6**])

Pertinent Results:
XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
CT chest/abd/pelvis/bone.
IMPRESSION:
1. The patient is status post splenectomy, with no evidence of
recurrent, or residual disease within the abdomen or pelvis.
2. New 1.6 x 0.8 cm focal opacity within the right upper lobe.
Continued attenuation to this area should be paid on continued
follow up scans.
3. Focal area of opacity within the left lobe anteriorly, is
unchanged from prior exam, and most likely represents a
parenchymal scar.

MRI Head:
FINDINGS: Comparison is made with prior study from [**2196-6-10**].
Overall, there has been no change. There are small areas of
increased T2 signal within the periventricular white matter,
within the deep white matter of both frontal lobes. These are
most consistent with chronic microvascular ischemic changes.
However, there is no evidence of acute infarct. There is no mass
effect. There is no midline shift. The lateral ventricles are
normal in size and configuration. The visualized vascular flow
voids are normal and present.
There is increased T2 hyperintensity within both mastoid
sinuses. This is more significant than on the prior examination.
These findings could be consistent with inflammatory/infectious
etiologies, including opportunistic infection.
IMPRESSION: 1.Increased fluid within both mastoid sinuses, could
secondary to inflammatory or infectious processes, including an
opportunistic infection.
2.Chronic small vessel infarction.
