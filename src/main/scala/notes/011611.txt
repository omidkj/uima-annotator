HOSPITAL COURSE BY ISSUE/SYSTEM:

1.  PULMONARY ISSUES:  The patient was successfully extubated
on [**2113-1-10**].   He completed his 14-day course of
levofloxacin for a suspected ventilator-associated pneumonia.

2.  CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM:  For his coronary artery disease,
the patient remained on Plavix and aspirin.  His beta blocker
was increased to metoprolol 50 mg p.o. t.i.d.   His ACE
inhibitor (captopril) was increased to 37.5 mg p.o. t.i.d.,
and he remained on his statin.

He remained in a normal sinus rhythm throughout his stay.  He
did have a lengthened QTc interval on his electrocardiogram.

3.  HEMATOLOGY/ONCOLOGY ISSUES:  The patient has a left upper
extremity deep venous thrombosis.  He remained on a heparin
drip and was started up on Coumadin.  Once his Coumadin
became therapeutic, the heparin drip was discontinued.

4.  NEUROLOGIC/PSYCHIATRIC ISSUES:  The patient appeared to
have suffered an anoxic brain injury secondary to his cardiac
arrest.

He was seen by the Neurology Service and Psychiatry Service

recommended using Haldol for agitation, but due to his
prolonged QTc interval the team decided to use a one-to-one
sitter along with appropriate redirection.
