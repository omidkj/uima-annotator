Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2698**]
Chief Complaint:
transfer from OSH w/ chest pain, VT

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
ICD placement


History of Present Illness:
59 yo male w/ hx of CAD - s/p CABG [**95**] yrs ago, recent NSTEMI
treated at [**Hospital1 2025**], and hx of NSVT who presented to OSH on [**2193-2-14**]
with chest pain. He was in his USOH when he developed [**2196-9-2**]
sharp, burning ssCP that radiated to his back upon awakening.
Antacid and nitro x3 did not improve his pain. This is different
from his usual CP which "does not vibrate" and radiates to his
jaw bone.
.
He drove to [**Hospital6 3105**] and was found to be in
hemodynamically stable VT. He received amiodarone 300 mg IV x 1
and was then started on an amio gtt @ 1 mg/hr. EKG was
unchanged. CK 500, trop 0.02. He was also started on a heparin
and nitro gtts and was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further
evaluation, consideration of EP study.
.
Since his arrival here, he has been in NSR. Vitals in the ED T
97.4 HR 92 BP 90/52 RR 16 sat 97% ra. EKG without overt ischemic
changes. He received dilaudid in the ED and subsequently had
three episode of hypotension with SBP 70s-80s. SBP --> 95 after
fluid boluses; HR remained in the 70s. Patient was alert and
mentating during these episodes. Following fluid boluses, noted
to be slightly more short of breath, sats 96% on 2L. First set
of CE here CK 500, trop 0.09.
.
On arrival to CCU, he is awake and oriented. He reports that his
earlier cehst pain has resolved. He does feel slightly short of
breath and wheezy. At baseline, he becomes SOB when walking up 1
flight of stairs or [**12-25**] blocks which is new over the past 2
months. He denies orthopnea or PND. He denies cough,
fevers/chills, abd pain. He denies an increase in lower ext
edema.

[**2-19**] CXR
FINDINGS: Compared with [**2193-2-16**], there has been interval
placement of a left subclavian single-lead ICD with its tip at
the right ventricular apex, in unremarkable position. No
pneumothorax identified.

There has been partial interval clearing of the patchy
atelectasis at the left lung base as well as at the right lung
base.

Lungs are otherwise grossly clear. No CHF or sizable effusions.

Incidental note is made of a small roughly 6-7 mm nodule
peripherally in the left mid-to-lower lung field. This was seen
to represent a subpleural nodule on the chest CT of [**2190-2-25**] and
is unchanged and therefore of no current clinical significance.

IMPRESSION: Unremarkable lead placement. No acute process.
.
[**2-16**] ECHO
Conclusions:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric
left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is mildly
dilated. Image  quality is suboptimal due to poor acoustic
windows but there is moderate regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction with probable anterior, inferior, and anterolateral
hypokinesis. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
moderately depressed. Right ventricular chamber size and free
wall motion are normal. The aortic root is moderately dilated at
the sinus level. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion. There is no
aortic valve stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral
regurgitation. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial
effusion.

Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable
for review) of [**2189-12-4**], the inferior hypokinesis may be new.
There has also been interval development of left ventricular
hypertrophy.

COMMENTS:
1. Selective coronary angiography revealed a right dominant
system with
severe [**Last Name (un) 15526**] vessel disease. LMCA was not engaged. LAD was
known
occludeed proximally but filled distally with LIMA and gave
robust
collaterals to the RCA territory. The LCX was known occluded but
the OMs
filled via an SVG. RCA was proximally occluded and an acute
marginal
filled from the SVG.
SVG to OM had diffuse disease with 80% ostial in stent
restenosis and a
70% lesion before the distal anastomosis.
SVG to the acute marginal had some diffuse disease and a 50-60%
mid
graft lesion.
LIMA to LAD was not injected but was known to be patent from an
angiogram in [**12/2192**] done at [**Hospital1 2025**] (films were reviewed).
2. Left ventriculography was deferred.
3. Limited hemodynamic assessment showed normal systemic aortic
pressures.
4. Successful PTCA and stenting of the proximal SVG-->OM
in-stent
restenosis with a 4.5 BMS. Final angiogram showed no residual
stenosis
with no angiographic evidence of dissection, embolization or
perforation
with TIMI III flow in the distal vessel. (See PTCA comments)
5. Partially successful balloon angioplasty of the distal
SVG-->OM
lesion with a 2.0 balloon. Final angiography revealed a 50%
residual
stenosis with no evidence of dissection, embolization or
peforation.
(See PTCA comments)

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Successful PCI of the proximal SCG-->OM lesion.
3. Partially successful PCI of the distal SVG-->OM lesion.
