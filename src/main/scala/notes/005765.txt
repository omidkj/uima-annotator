Chief Complaint:
Transfer from OSH for management of ARF and neuro [**Known lastname **]-up for
stroke vs. seizure

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None.


History of Present Illness:
79 yo M w/ h/o ARF d/t contrast (since resolved), h/o SDH ([**2172**]
s/p drainage), HTN, and COPD who presents from OSH for
management of acute renal failure and for neuro evaluation.
Patient reports "stomach flu" x 1 week with increased ostomy
output.  Patient reports he has been unable to keep up w/ PO
fluid intake.  Also c/o dizziness x3-4 days.  +fatigue,
difficulty sleeping.  Decreased urine output.  Denies syncope.
Denies F/C, abd pain, nausea/vomiting, BRB in ostomy or rectum,
melena, CP/SOB, or sick contacts.  [**Name (NI) **] also reports
intermittent word finding difficulty, and dropping things x 1
day.  More forgetful, difficulty remembering people's names,
difficulty with driving.  No recent med changes.
.
At OSH, inital BP low at 89/45, improved w/ IVF.  Patient was
noted to be in acute renal failure and hyperkalemic with a
BUN/cr of 153/16.  He received insulin/D50, calcium gluconate,
kayexalate.  He also received ativan 0.5 x2, as well as NS.  He
was then tansferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for evaluation of ARF/hyperkalemia,
as well as neuro evaluation.  In the ED at OSH, he was also
noted to have multiple "mult. seizure-like movements lasting <1
second" occuring every 15-30 seconds.  These were described as
"tic-like," without LOC or confusion.  He reportedly stops
talking, and his arms jerk.  Denies any prior episodes.  Head CT
radiologist).
.
In the ED at [**Hospital1 18**], patient vitals stable.  Remained
hyperkalemic. S/p urgent renal consult in ED who felt that
patient was prerenal, did not recommend acute HD.  He was given
Insulin/D50, CaGluc, kayexalate, and 3amps NaHCO3 per renal.
Also given levofloxacin 500mg IV x1 for UTI.  Renal U/S
negative.  S/p neuro eval in ED who felt that neuro complaints
were [**1-5**] encephalopathy due to metabolic derangements.

RENAL ULTRASOUND: The right kidney measures 10.5 cm. The left
kidney measures 11.0 cm. There is no evidence of hydronephrosis
on either side. Cortical thickness is preserved bilaterally. No
free fluid is seen in the abdomen. The bladder is collapsed.
-No evidence of hydronephrosis. Normal cortical renal thickness
bilaterally.

[**2176-1-27**] Portable CXR- Single portable radiograph of the chest
demonstrates marked interval improvement in previously seen
right-sided pleural effusion. The right internal jugular central
venous catheter is no longer present. Cardiomediastinal contours
are within normal limits. There is mild blunting of the right
costophrenic angle. The left costophrenic angle is sharp.
Tracheostomy has been removed. No consolidation is evident.
Assessment of the pulmonary parenchyma is slightly limited by
respiratory motion.

Near-complete resolution of previously seen right-sided pleural
effusion with mild persistent blunting of the right costophrenic

Brief Hospital Course:
79yo male with hx of prior contrast nephropathy, s/p subtotal
colectomy and ileostomy who presented with ARF with Cr to 16.5
which appeared to be pre-renal secondary to gastroenteritis with
increased ostomy output and decreased PO fluid intake. Of note,
at OSH he also had some ? seizure-like activity which neurology
here attributes to uremic encephalopathy. A head CT scan was
done at OSH which was negative per reports. Creatinine was as
high as 16 at one point and he was called out from MICU on [**1-27**]
after aggressive rehydration and improvement in renal function.
.
Course on medicine floor:
We continued his IVF @ 200/hr, he has had good UOP, no longer
having increased output through ostomy, and tolerating PO. Renal
function continued to improve. He had elevated Na level with
persistently low bicarb, changed IVF to free water with bicarb.
Neurologically stable. Pt put on course of Cipro for urinary
tract infection. Hyponatremia resolved with fluids, diarrhea
resolved, renal failure quickly responded to fluids with
creatinine peak at ~16.5, at 2.3 at discharge.
.
# ACUTE RENAL FAILURE:
Likely prerenal in setting of hypovolemia due to
diarrhea/increased ostomy output. BUN, Cr trending down at time
of discharge. Adequate UOP. No signs of volume overload. Na
elevated secondary to aggressive re-hydration with NS. Low
bicarbonate from renal failure and rapid volume expansion. Renal
function continued to improve, with adequate urine output. BP
meds were held to maintain renal perfusion. Continued sevelamer
and closely monitored electrolyte abnormalities. He did not meet
objective criteria for hemodialysis while inpatient. Creatinine
as stated earlier dramatically improved. Patient discharged with
creatinine 2.3, to have follow up labs with PCP.
.
# WEAKNESS/WORD FINDING DIFFICULTY:
Questioned encephalopathy secondary to uremia. Per neuro, felt
changes in mental status related to underlying metabolic
derangement. CT head OSH reportedly negative, with read as per
neuro negative. Corrected underlying metabolic abnormalities. No
seizure activity or focal neurological deficits in house. Neuro
felt patient stable for discharge with resolution of symptoms as
uremia resolved.
.
# DIARRHEA:
Suspected viral gastroenteritis. Large amount of fluid loss in
stool leading to subsequent hypovolemia, acute renal failure.
C-diff toxin negative. Stool culture neg. Aggressive IVF
rehydration, followed volume status, WBC, fever curve all
trended down to discharge. Pt advised to keep hydrated, and
return to the ED if he experiences increasing ostomy output.
.
# HYPERKALEMIA:
[**1-5**] to ARF; resolved s/p treatment at OSH and at the [**Hospital1 18**] with
Insulin/D50, CaGluc, Kayexalate, and 3amps NaHCO3 per renal. No
changes on EKG. Monitored on tele without events.
.
# PANCREATIC DYSFUNCTION:
Elevated pancreatic enzymes, trending down. No complaints of
abdominal pain. Tolerating PO diet. Continued low fat diet
through admission.
.
# UTI:
On admission. Cipro, renally dosed. Increased to 500 QD as renal
function improved.
.
# COPD:
continued albuterol/Atrovent w
