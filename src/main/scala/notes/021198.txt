Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1253**]
Chief Complaint:
Hypercarbic respiratory failure

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Endotracheal intubation [**2198-5-29**], self-extubated [**2198-5-30**]

History of Present Illness:
72 year-old woman with history of COPD on home O2, atrial
fibrillation, DM, OSA and CKD who presents to the hospital with
respiratory failure.  Per the patient's daughter, the patient
had been feeling relatively well since her last discharge on [**5-21**]
until yesterday, when she started having some mild difficulty
breathing but per her daughter declined to go see the doctor.
Of note, during that admission she had hypoxia that was thought
to be secondary to flash pulmonary edema.

This morning, the patient developed severe respiratory distress
and EMS was called.  By report of them they were called to the
house for a female with increasing shortness of breath, who
found her with poor air exchange, lethargic, with normal blood
pressure in 150's and hr<100, but with poor air exchange,
increasingly lethargic, and after a trial with CPAP, failed and
EMS proceeded with intubation with sedative without paralytic,
first pass success but reportedly difficult intubation.

In the ED, initial VS were: afebrile 60 140/70 100% on vent.
She received levofloxacin, solumedrol and was placed on propofol
for sedation.  Her first ABG on arrival showed marked
respiratory acidosis with hypercarbia, ABG was 7.22/107/59/46.
Her vent settings on transfer were assist control, FiO2 40%,
400, 22 and 10.  On arrival, these were adjusted to FiO2 40%,
350, 20 and 5.  Her repeat ABG showed marked improvement of her
hypercarbia, and was 7.44/56/132/39.  On arrival to the MICU,
patient's VS were 97.6 67 138/86 14 100%.

Review of systems:  Unable to obtain but per the family the
patient had no sick contacts, fever or chills prior to
admission.

IMAGING:
[**2198-5-29**] ECG: Baseline abnormalities. Probable sinus rhythm.
Left atrial abnormality. Left anterior fascicular block. Lateral
T wave abnormalities. Since the previous tracing of [**2198-5-18**] the
rate is now slower. Otherwise, there may be no significant
change.

[**2198-5-29**] CHEST XRAY (portable): Moderate pulmonary edema with
small right pleural effusion.

[**2198-6-1**] CHEST XRAY (PA and lateral): In comparison with the
study of [**5-30**], there has been improvement in the pulmonary
vascular congestion.  Some elevation of pulmonary venous
pressure persists.  The area of increased opacification in the
left perihilar region has almost completely cleared.  Mild
atelectatic changes are seen at the left base.
