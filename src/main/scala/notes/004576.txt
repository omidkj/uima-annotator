IMAGING:
[**2101-1-6**] CT Chest: Mildly displaced left 8th-10th rib fx with
assoc. consolidation of adjacent lung, likely reflect contusion.
Small cystic spaces in right lower lobe medial basal, may
reflect pneumatoceles. T3 compression fx, likely acute
[**2101-1-6**] CT L-spine: No fx or spondylolisthesis
[**2101-1-6**] ECHO: The LA is elongated. The RA is moderately dilated.
Mild symmetric LV hypertrophy with normal cavity size. Mild
regional LV systolic dysfunction with inferior akinesis and
hypokinesis of the basal inferolateral and inferoseptal
segments. The remaining segments contract normally (LVEF =
40-45%). RV chamber size and free wall motion are normal. Mild
MR & AR.
[**1-7**] CT head: no ICH
[**1-7**] CXR: increased LLL effusion
[**1-10**] CXR: no pneumo s/p bronch, slight improvement in aeration @
bases
[**1-12**] CXR: trach in standard placement. mild bibasilar
atelectasis stable, small right pleural effusion has increased,
no pulmonary edema, heart size is normal. No pneumo. Right PIC
line passes to the edge of the right chest cage, and a leftPIC
line can be traced to the junction of the brachiocephalic veins.


Brief Hospital Course:
The patient is an 88yoM admitted to the trauma surgery service
on [**2101-1-6**] s/p mechanical fall from standing; tx'd from OSH
after being dx'd w/ C2 fracture, and pneumonia; he was initially
admitted to TICU given age and mental status, but was
re-admitted to the TICU within 1 day of tx to the floor for
respiratory distressa and bradycardia requiring intubation. Now
s/p Trach and PEG.

EVENTS:
[**1-6**] Admit to TICU. Transfer to floor.
[**1-7**]: Readmit to TICU [**12-21**] desaturations on NRB (70-80%).
[**1-8**]: Code called - atropine X 2 given, intubation for desats
and bradycardia, mucous plugging.
[**1-8**]: aline, PICC line, changed foley, intermittent bloody UOP.
following commands. intermittent brady to mid-40s.
[**1-10**]: dobhoff placement in IR, trauma line dc'ed, bronch w/ BAL

[**1-11**]: Trops neg. EKG: afib, ? LBBB. cardiology recs: Wenckebach
vs. complete heart block. no intervention at this point as BP
stable during brady episodes, atropine for Sx bradycardia, EP
consult when extubated and more stable as he likely warrants a
pacer. hypotension [**1-12**] oxycodone/hydralazine/PPF at one time,
briefly on neo.
[**1-13**]: started TFs, d/c'ed cefepime & cipro after sputum ->
+MRSA, PT/OT

Neuro: The patient was diagnoaed with C2 fracture, but was
neurologically intact. Neurosurgery spine was consulted and
recomended that the remain in [**Location (un) 2848**] J at all times for at least
4 weeks. No logroll or sugical intervention needed. The pt will
need to f/u with NS in 4 weeks with repeat C-spine CT. He also
had difficulty with altered mental status and delirium during
his hospitalization. He received oxycodone and morphine for pain
while admitted.

CV: The patient was found to be in atrial fibrillation on
admission. He also had episodes of intermittent bradycardia.
Cardiology was consulted and thought his rhythm was Wenckebach
vs. complete heart block. They additionally recommended that no
intervention be undertaken at this point as the patient's blood
pressure remained stable during bradycardic episodes, that the
patient receive atropine for symptomatic or hypotensive
bradycardia, and recommended starting aspirin.  The patient will
likely place a pacemaker when his c-collar is removed.

Pulmonary: The patient's respiratory status decompensated when
transfered to the floor. At that time he was intubated. His
decompensation was thought to be due to an aspiration event as
food pieces and pills were suctioned form his lungs after
intubation. The patient was not able to extubated due to mental
status and secretions, as well as failing several SBTs.  He
underwent tracheostomy placement and a PMV was ordered.

GI/GU: The patient was aggressively resuscitated as needed
during his hospitalization in order to maintain urine output.
Due to his aspiration event, the patient had a percutaneous peg
tube placed for tube feeding and he was kept strictly NPO. He
was also started on a bowel regimen to encourage bowel movement.
Foley removal was attempted but had to be replaced due to
urinary retention. Intake and output were closely monitored.

ID: The patient was initially on Levoquin after admission for
community acquired pneumonia. After his respiratory
decompensation, antibiotic coverage was broadened. Additionally,
BAL cultures were sent which grew MRSA. The patient's antibiotic
regimen was narrowed to just Vancomycin. The patient will need
14 days of therapy.

Prophylaxis: The patient received subcutaneous heparin during
this stay. PT was consulted to get the patient out of bed to a
chair.

At the time of discharge on HD#8, the patient was doing well,
afebrile with stable vital signs on TM mask, tolerating tube
feeds, foley in place and pain was well-controlled on PO pain
medication.
