Chief Complaint:
Worst headache of life

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2119-4-30**] COil embolization of two right MCA aneurysms


History of Present Illness:
This is a 49 year old African American woman  who awoke from
sleep in the middle of the night and had the sudden onet of a
severe, disabling headache.  After several seconds, the
magnitude of the headache decreased somewhat, but
remained severe and did not remit.  She was brought to ED, where
CT head and CTA head demonstrated subarachnoid hemorrhage and 2
right MCA aneurysms.  She was hypertensive to SBP 200 on
presentation, and this was rapidly controlled.  She c/o
headache, suboccipital/neck pain.  No diplopia, numbness,
weakness,
paresthesias.  Mild nausea, no emesis.  No prior similar
episodes.

Pertinent Results:
[**2119-4-30**] CTA
1. Extensive subarachnoid hemorrhage in the basal cisterns and
sylvian
fissures bilaterally and in the right parietal lobe as described
above.
2. 5 mm x 7 mm sized multilobulated right MCA bifurcation
aneurysm.
3. 4 mm sized right M1 segment MCA aneurysm

[**2119-4-30**] angio
Ms. [**Known firstname 1894**] [**Known lastname 51078**] underwent cerebral angiography and coil
embolization of two aneurysms arising from the right middle
cerebral artery, one from the right MCA bifurcation and a second
aneurysm arising from the right M1 segment. Both aneurysms were
successfully embolized. This was uneventful and there were no
complications

[**2119-4-30**] CXR
There is hyperinflation of the lungs and upper lobe predominant
emphysema.
Diffuse predominantly mid and lower lobe interstitial lung
opacities are
present, representing either atypical/opportunistic infection
(such as
Pneumocystis), dependent distribution of interstitial edema or
inflammatory airway disease mimicking interstitial lung disease.
The cardiomediastinal shilhouette and hilar are normal. There is
no pleural effusion and no pneumothorax.

[**2119-4-30**] CXR Mild pulmonary edema has improved over the past 12
hours. Heart size is normal. Small region of atelectasis
persists at the base of the left lung, but obscures what may
have nodule visible on [**2117-10-27**]. When feasible,
conventional chest radiograph should be obtained

[**2119-5-1**]
Normal TCD evaluation. There was no evidence of
vasospasm.

[**2119-5-2**]
 Normal TCD evaluation. There was no evidence of
vasospasm.

CTA HEAD W&W/O C & RECONS [**2119-5-6**]
1. New subcentimeter low-attenuation focus in posterior right
parietal
subcortical white matter, suspicious for interval subacute
infarction, perhaps embolic.
2. Interval clearing of the extensive diffuse subarachnoid
blood, with no new hemorrhage, and no evidence of development of
hydrocephalus.
3. Status post coiling of the the aneurysms at both the
bifurcation and the M1 segment of the right MCA, with associated
metallic artifact, limiting the evaluation of
immediately-adjacent parenchyma

MR HEAD W/O CONTRAST [**2119-5-7**]
1. Small subacute infarct in posterior right parietal
subcortical white
matter with punctate focus (or foci) in the overlying cortex;
these are likely embolic in nature.
2. No acute infarction elsewhere.
3. Status post recent coiling of two MCA aneurysms, with no
evidence of new hemorrhage.


Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 51078**] was admited to the Neurosurgical Intensive care unit
and taken to the angio suite immediately after her arrival where
she was intubated and sedated.  We were able to coil two
aneurysms in the proximal and distal right MCA.  She was
extubated following the procedure and recovered in the ICU.  She
remained stable on heparin gtt overngiht.  She was started on
aspirin therapy.  Her diet and activity were advanced the
following morning. Baseline TCD's were performed on [**5-1**] and were
negative for vasospasm. She was moved OOB on [**5-2**] and TCD repeat
was negative.

She continued to have headache on [**5-3**] and prednisone was
started. TCDs showed some above normal velocities of MCA/ACA on
left but not high enough to be considered true vasospasm. On
[**5-4**] she was neurologically stable and TCD's revealed above nl
vel of MCA, ok in comp to [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **]-AT, therefore there was not
concern. She continued to have headache on [**5-5**] and TCD which
showed velocities in the high end of normal range and no spasm.
She remained neurologically intact and was transferred to the
floor.On [**5-6**], CTA head was done which was negative for
vasospasm. There was a question of a very small occipital
infarct. MRI head was ordered for further evaluation. Her exam
remained stable. On [**5-7**], MRI head confirmed small subacute
infarct in occipital region, but since patient remained stable
on exam, no intervention is needed. Her NA level was 132 and IVF
was restarted. On [**5-8**], patient reported slight headache
otherwise stable. On [**5-9**], patient was tolerating POs and
ambulating independently. She was discharged home with no
services.

**It was discovered during this admission that she does not have
sarcoidosis althouth some recent OMR note mention this in the
history. She saw a pulmonologist for chronic mediastinal
lymphadenopathy and elevated ACE levels. He was not convinced of
this and it is noted in his OMR note from [**2118-9-29**].
