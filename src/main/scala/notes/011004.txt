History of Present Illness:
This is a 57 year old female with a history of HTN, DM,
hyperlipidemia, and OSA who presented to [**Hospital6 **] on
[**2185-10-20**] with 3 days of HA, sorethroat, myalgias, and epigastric
pain with some associated nausea. Upon arrival to the OSH ED,
she had a temp of 101. Per report, initial EKG was
non-diagnostic but CEZ were initially positive with CPK of 574,
MB of 11.5, and TropI of 14.96. She denied chest pain initially
and shortness of breath. She had several ECGs performed there,
which show initial T wave inversions in lateral leads (10AM, no
symptoms), followed by an ECG with inferior ST elevations with
an RCA (III>II) occlusion pattern that apparently occurred with
chest pain. She was started on a nitro drip and Integrillin.
However, it appears that the ST elevations were missed and she
was transferred under the auspices of an "NSTEMI". She had also
developed acute renal failure, with a creatinine rise from 1.2
to 3.1 on [**10-21**].
.
Upon arrival at [**Hospital1 18**], she was found to be ashen in color, and
hypotensive with blood pressure of 95-105/50s, with sats of
90-93% on 5LNC.  An ECG was performed, which showed the same
inferior STE, and at 2:45PM a code STEMI was called and she was
taken to the cath lab. In the cath lab, she was found to have
diffuse multivessel disease with 70% distal thrombotic left main
lesion, 60% RCA, diffuse disease in the LAD, and 60% RCA. Her
culprit lesion was felt to be the distal LAD lesion. While
preparing for a diagnostic IVUS of the LMCA and prior to LAD
PCI, the patient had an episode of hypotension, bradycardia, and
hypoxia. She was intubated and received atropine, epinephrine,
and emergency pacing with tempory pacer wire placed. Started on
dopamine and levophed. She received 1 BMS to her LMCA and 2 BMS
in her distal LAD. A right iliac angioplasty was also performed.
 An IABP was placed. The levophed was able to be weened off and
milrinone was started with an increase in CI from 1.5 to 2.1
L/min.
.
Rest of ROS unable to be obtained due to intubation.

COMMENTS:
1. Coronary angiography in this co-dominant system revealed
severe three
vessel coronary artery disease.  The LMCA had a distal 70%
thrombotic
lesion.  The LAD had diffuse disease with a proximal 60%
stenosis and
serial 40-50% stenoses throughout the remainder of the vessel,
which was
approximately 2.25mm in diameter.  The LCX had a 60% stenosis at
the
origin, with diffuse disease in the OM1 and OM2, which were
approximately 2.0mm in diameter.  The RCA had a proximal 60%
stenosis,
with a long 50% stenosis in the mid-vessel, which was 2.5mm in
diameter.
The PDA and PL were diffusely diseased and small.
2. Resting hemodynamics revealed elevated left- and right-sided
filling
pressures with mean RA pressure of 31 mmHg and mean PCW pressure
of 30
mmHg.  There was moderate pulmonary hypertension, with systolic
PA
pressure of 48 mmHg.  The cardiac output was low prior to
intervention
and placement of intra-aortic balloon pump at 2.85 L/min, and
increased
to 3.78 L/min following IABP placement and initiation of
milrinone.
3. Supravalvular aortography revealed no significant aortic
insufficiency, aortic dilation, or aortic dissection.
4. Distal aortography revealed diffuse severe disease with 50%
stenosis
below the renal arteries.  The renal arteries themselves were
single
bilaterally and without significant stenosis.  Difficulty was
encountered during passage of the access wire.  Iliac
angiography
revealed mild disease in the left common iliac artery, with a
patent
internal iliac artery and widely patent common femoral artery.
The right
common iliac artery had an 80% stenosis, and the right internal
iliac
artery was occluded.  The right common femoral artery was widely
patent.
5. Successful PTCA of the right CIA stenosis with a 5.0x20mm
Admiral
balloon.
6. Successful direct stenting of the LMCA with a 2.5x12mm Vision
stent.
Final angiography revealed no residual stenosis, no
angiographically
apparent dissection and TIMI III flow.
7. Successful direct stenting of the proximal and mid LAD with a

2.25x28mm and a 2.25x28mm Vision stents. Final angiography
revealed no
residual stenosis, no angiographically apparent dissection and
TIMI III
flow.
8. Successful placement of a temporary pacing wire in the RV
with pacing
required to restore heart rate.
9. Successful deployement of 30CC IABP.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Cardiogenic shock with low cardiac output, managed by IABP.
3. Acute inferior myocardial infarction, managed by PTCA of
vessel.
4. Elevated left- and right-sided filling pressures.
5. Aortic atherosclerosis with right iliac disease.
6. Successful PTA of the right CIA stenosis.
7. Successful PCI of the LMCA and LAD.
8. Successful deployment of IABP.

CT ABDOMEN WITHOUT CONTRAST: The lung bases reveal small
bilateral pleural
effusions and associated compressive atelectasis.
Atherosclerotic coronary
calcifications are partially imaged. There is no evidence for
pericardial
effusion.

Limited non-contrast evaluation of the liver, spleen and adrenal
glands is
unremarkable. The pancreas demonstrates fatty atrophy but is
otherwise
unremarkable. Contrast from recent intravenous administration
persists within
the kidneys and renal collecting system, which are enhanced
symmetrically
without hydronephrosis or hydroureter. A nasoenteric tube
terminates in the
duodenum. Intra-abdominal loops of large and small bowel are of
normal caliber
and there is no pneumoperitoneum. Mild ascites is noted,
predominantly
perihepatically and perisplenically. There are no pathologically
enlarged
mesenteric or retroperitoneal lymph nodes. Severe
atherosclerotic
calcifications involve a hypoplastic aorta.

CT PELVIS WITH CONTRAST: The rectum, sigmoid colon is
unremarkable. T
