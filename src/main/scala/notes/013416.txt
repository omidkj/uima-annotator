Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 425**]
Chief Complaint:
Presented for elective AV junction ablation, admitted for
respiratory arrest and flash pulmonary edema post-procedure.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
AV junction ablation.

History of Present Illness:
This is a gentleman with a long history of atrial fibrillation
which has been maintained fairly well on Dofetilide until
recently.  He was noted upon interrogation of his device during
an electrophysiology clinic visit on [**2133-8-18**] to have an
increase in his atrial fibrillation burden from 1.3% to 4.2% of
the time.  He was in atrial fibrillation at the time of his
visit and for the previous month.  He has been noted to have an
increase in his serum creatinine level over the past year from
1.2 to 1.6. Therefore increasing his Dofetilide dose was
contraindicated.  He was therefore referred for AV nodal
ablation.
.
Of note, at time of this admission he denies any symptoms
including palpitations, shortness of breath, lightheadedness,
dizziness, syncope or presyncope.  He has been scheduled for
this procedure twice before and cancelled due to an elevated
INR; he has been off coumadin since [**2133-10-15**] and his INR was 1.9
the morning of the procedure.
.
Today he presented for AJV ablation in his usual state of
health. He received Diazepam 5 mg prior to procedure but no
further sedatives and minimal IVF (<50cc) during procedure; he
tolerated the procedure well, was able to lie flat without
event. While dressing in the recovery area, he became dyspneic;
while EP fellow was examining pt, he became cyanotic and, when
she asked him to lie back for a CXR and ABG, he became
unresponsive. Code Blue was called; he was intubated and an
emergent right femoral line was placed.


Past Medical History:
1. Cor pulmonale, chronic
2. CHF (diastolic dysfxn) EF >55%.
3. Chronic bronchitis on 3L home O2 at all times (FEV1 58 %
predicted with ratio 112%)
4. Home OSA BiPAP settings are 18 and 11 with 3 L of
supplemental oxygen during the day
5. HTN
6. Obesity
7. Pulm HTN
8. CRI-baseline creat 1.3-1.8


Social History:
He is married and lives with wife. [**Name (NI) **] smoked 2 PPD x35 years and
quit 15 years ago. He drinks 1-2 beers/week. He worked full-time
as quality engineer (mechanical engineer) wearing oxygen to
work, has not worked since his hospitalization in [**Month (only) 205**].


Family History:
His father is with DM, no heart disease in family, only his
brother has HTN.

CXR AT TIME OF ADMISSION ([**2133-10-23**]):
FINDINGS: There is an endotracheal tube with tip approximately
3.5 cm cranial to the carina. There is a left, dual-lead
pacemaker with the lead tips positioned over the right atrium
and right ventricle.  There is new, diffuse, bilateral pulmonary
opacity consistent with fulminant pulmonary edema. There are no
pleural effusions and the cardiomediastinal contour is normal.
The cardiac contour is obscured by the overlying pulmonary
edema. The soft tissue structures and bony thorax are normal.
IMPRESSION:
1. Diffuse, bilateral pulmonary edema.
2. Endotracheal tube with tip seen 3.5 cm cranial to the carina.
..
CXR ([**2133-10-28**]) LAT [**Month (only) **] AND PA:
IMPRESSION: Left decubitus chest as requested read in
conjunction with a
frontal chest radiograph performed 8:52 a.m., reported
separately, and prior chest radiographs dated [**10-26**] and
16. There is no appreciable right pleural effusion or
pneumothorax. Mild pulmonary edema is noted.
..
TTE ([**2133-10-24**]):
The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Due to
suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality
cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%). There is no ventricular
septal defect. The right ventricular cavity is markedly dilated
with depressed free wall contractility. The aortic root is
mildly dilated at the sinus level. The ascending aorta is mildly
dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but
aortic stenosis is not present. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation
is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild to
moderate ([**2-11**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Tricuspid regurgitation is
present but cannot be quantified. There is severe pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is a small pericardial
effusion. There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
..
ABDOMINAL U/S ([**2133-10-24**]):
1. Cholelithiasis without evidence of cholecystitis.
2. Cirrhosis and moderate ascites, without evidence of focal
liver lesion.
3. Splenomegaly.

Brief Hospital Course:
In summary this is a 64 year-old man with h/o pulmonary HTN,
OSA, COPD on home O2 and BiPAP at night, cor pulmonale, CRI
(creat 1.5-2.0) in last year, and AF with RVR s/p PPM, now s/p
AVJ ablation.  He presents with hypercarbic respiratory failure
in the setting of lying flat for EP procedure.
..
# HYPERCARBIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE:
Acuity of the event and CXR were c/w acute pulmonary edema,
although not clear what the inciting event may have been, and,
additionally, pulmonary edema generally causes hypoxic arrest
rather than hypercarbic arrest.  Mucus plugging in a patient
with chronic COPD was also considered; aspiration was also in
the differential, although history of event and CXR did not
support either of these diagnoses.
.
He was diuresed several liters and slowly weaned off of the vent
to ventilator settings w/ mask and then to BiPAP on the second
day.  His oxygen requirement slowly decreased with continued
diuresis as well as nebulizers and inhaled steroids for
treatment of his COPD.  He was kept on his home BiPAP settings
at night.
.
He was seen by pulmonary and they recommended adding Diamox to
reverse the contraction alkalosis a/w Lasix therapy.  Thus we
added acetazolamide to his regimen of Lasix and metolazone.  We
have stopped the Diamox after three days of therapy and will
discharge him on Lasix 80 mg PO twice daily and metolazone 2.5
mg every other day.
..
# FEVER / PULMONARY INFILTRATE:
He spiked a fever to 102 on the third night after admission.
Sputum cultures (good sample) showed rare growth of E. coli and
K. Pneumoniae but given no predominant organism there was
unknown significance of this culture; both bacteria were pan
sensitive. There was a retrocardiac opacity on CXR concerning
for PNA, thus we started him empirically on high-dose
levoflo
