Admission Date: [**2117-12-1**]        Discharge Date: [**2118-1-8**]


Service:  [**Last Name (un) **]


HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 84-year-old gentleman
who was seen at an outside hospital who complained abdominal
pain.  During that time he also underwent an episode of
hypertension and chest pain.  It was found that he had a
severe myocardial infarction and an elevation in his
troponin.  His abdominal pain was then evaluated.  On
admission to that hospital it was found that the patient had
a perforated diverticulitis.

The patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 **] for
further management.  The patient had a long hospice care
which will be detailed subsequently.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for coronary artery
disease, atrial fibrillation, hypertension, and high
cholesterol.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Significant for orthopedic
contractures.

MEDICATIONS AT HOME:  Lipitor, insulin, Lopressor, aspirin,
Pravachol.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  He was afebrile.  His
heart rate was in the 80s.  His blood pressure was down
approximately 96/43.  He was intubated at the time with 100
percent oxygen saturation.  His lungs were clear.  Heart was
regular.  The abdomen was soft.  It was significantly tender
in the bilateral lower quadrants (right greater than left).
His rectal examination was guaiac negative.  His extremities
were warm and well perfused.

LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION:  Unremarkable at the time;
however, as noted he had an elevated troponin indicative of a
myocardial infarction.

SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was transferred to
the [**Hospital1 **].  His hospital course was extremely
complicated, however.  He underwent a percutaneous drainage
of his diverticulitis abscess fluid collection on [**12-3**].  On [**12-6**], the patient had complete control of his
diverticular episode with the abscess drained.  The patient
was kept nothing by mouth.  After resolution of his symptoms,
he was begun on tube feedings.  The output from the drains
were minimal and were slowly decreasing over the hospital
stay.

From a cardiac standpoint, his troponin's were elevated and
Cardiology was consulted.  They felt that medical management
was the best option for the patient and that cardiac
catheterization would not be a reasonable option due to his
overwhelming sepsis.  The patient slowly stabilized from a
cardiac standpoint; however, he developed gram-negative
bacteremia as well as multiple pneumoniae which ultimately
caused respiratory failure requiring prolonged intubation and
tracheostomy.  The patient also underwent a PEG placement at
the time of the tracheostomy placement.

The patient slowly had a decline in function and again needed
fluid resuscitation.  It was found that the patient had an
episode of severe pancreatitis.  Due to his multiple fluid
boluses, both from his diverticular episode as well as for
his pancreatitis, the patient was ultimately started on CVVH
after his creatinine had risen and his BUN had risen greater
than 100.

However, after prolonged discussions with his family, it was
felt that the patient's prognosis was extremely poor.  The
family decided to make the patient comfort measures only.
The patient was extubated on [**2118-1-7**] and was given
morphine and Ativan for comfort.  The patient expired on
[**2118-1-8**] of respiratory failure.  The entire family
was present during this time as well as a nurse.  The patient
was pronounced dead at 1:14 p.m. with the family present.
The family deferred decision on autopsy at this time.  The
Medical Examiner was [**Name (NI) 653**], and the case was declined.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 6633**] was also notified at that time.
