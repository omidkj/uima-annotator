ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was brought to the unit where
he was evaluated for lower gastrointestinal bleed.  The
patient underwent an angiogram on [**9-20**].  The
angiogram demonstrated the SMA and [**Female First Name (un) 899**] had no evidence of
acute hemorrhage or as being the source of the bleeding.  The
patient had a surgical consult to evaluate his lower
gastrointestinal bleeding and it was determined that due to
the extensive nature and recurrence of his gastrointestinal
bleeding, surgical intervention was warranted.  On [**2174-9-20**], the patient underwent a left colectomy.  There
were no complications during the procedure and the patient
remained intubated after leaving the Operating Room and was
transferred to the Intensive Care Unit.  In the Intensive
Care Unit, the patient was seen by the cardiology consults
who helped evaluate and manage his coronary artery disease
and congestive heart failure.  It was advised that the
patient continued to be beta blocked, serial cardiac enzymes
and not to resume anticoagulation.  On post-operative day No.
1, the patient was weaned off his propofol drip and placed on
morphine and Ativan p.r.n.  The patient was also taken off
SIMV ventilation and weaned down to CPAP.  The patient had a
normal ABG demonstrated at that time.  From a cardiovascular
standpoint, the patient was placed on a nitroglycerin and
diltiazem drip after ruling in for a myocardial infarction by
troponin with a maximum troponin of 1.25 followed by another
troponin of .92.  On post-operative day No. 2, the patient
was continued on his Kefzol and Flagyl.  He remained on CPAP
with a pressure support of 40%.  Pressure support of 5.
Continue the ventilation weaning.  The patient was negative
approximately 1-2 liters.  Post-operative day No. 4, the
patient's chest x-ray demonstrated a decrease in the edema
throughout, but a new right-sided pleural effusion.  The
patient remained sedated and on CPAP with a pressure support
of 5.  The patient was febrile overnight with a T-max of
101.7??????.  Blood cultures and sputum cultures were sent off at
this time.  Additionally, the patient's central line was
changed and the tip was sent off for culture.  Additionally,
on post-operative day No. 4, the patient was extubated at
noon without incident.  The patient was placed on a 50% 02
mask and sats remained in the 94-97%.  On [**2174-9-24**],
the patient continued to do well.  The only complications
dealt with his cardiac issues where it was very difficult to
rate control his atrial fibrillation and refractory
hypertension.  The patient was still on Nitroglycerin,
diltiazem and Lopressor plus p.r.n. hydralazine.  The patient
remained in the unit on Lopressor 25 mg q4 hours and then
placed on hydralazine 20 mg q6 hours.  The patient was taken
off his diltiazem on post-operative day No. 5 and his
Nitroglycerin paste was decreased from 1" to 0.5" q6 hours.
By [**9-25**], the patient was doing much better,
considered less lethargic than the day before.  His lung exam
was markedly improved with his oxygen weaned to off and the
02 saturation remained in the 97-99% on room air.  On
[**9-26**], the patient was transferred out of the
Intensive Care Unit to the floor.  On post-operative day No.
6, patient arrived on the floor.  The patient was still
hypertensive and tachycardic.  At this time the patient was
passing flatus but still  mildly distended and it was decided
to remain NPO.  On post-operative day No. 8, the patient was
ambulating, his pain was well controlled on PCA.  He still
continued to pass flatus but was still distended.  It was
decided to place the patient on TPN.  The night of [**9-28**], Green Surgery on-call resident was paged due to patient
having heart rate of 130s to 140s and frequent PVCs.  The
patient was seen and examined.  The patient had no
complaints, denied any chest pain, shortness of breath,
lightheadedness, numbness or tingling.  Earlier that day the
patient had been taken off his IV Lopressor and started on 25
mg of Lopressor twice a day by mouth and his Verapamil 120 mg
three times a day.  The patient was given an additional dose
of 12.5 mg of Lopressor p.o. and his standing dose of
Lopressor was increased from 25 mg p.o. to 37.5 mg p.o.  The
patient responded well to this and had no further episodes of
tachycardia.  On post-operative day No. 9, the patient was
placed on full liquids which he tolerated without difficulty.
The patient continued to pass flatus and have bowel
movements.  The patient remained slightly hypertensive.  The
patient's Lopressor was changed from 37.5 mg three times a
day to 50 mg three times a day and his Verapamil was changed
from 120 mg three times a day to 360 mg sustained release.
The patient was placed on a regular diet, encouraged to
ambulate and discharge planning was initiated.

The patient was discharged home on post-operative day No. 6.
