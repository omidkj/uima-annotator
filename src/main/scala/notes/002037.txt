Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2698**]
Chief Complaint:
SOB

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
intubation

History of Present Illness:
89 y/o female with MMP including severe AS s/p bioprosthetic AVR
([**2155-2-13**]), dCHF (EF>55%), afib (on coumadin), CRI (baseline Cr
1.3-1.6), HTN, HLD, and history of pulmonary edema after
surgery, who was re-hospitalized for CHF exacerbation after her
AVR, and was discharged from rehab to home on [**2155-3-26**]. She now
presents with worsening dyspnea and lower extremity edema. She
was noted to have gained 5 lbs at rehab, and her outpatient
lasix regimen (40 mg daily) was increased to 80 mg daily
yesterday. She was noted to be 87% RA this AM by VNA. She was
asked to come to [**Hospital1 **] for evaluation. Of note, at rehab, she had
VRE UTI that has not been treated (she was on cipro, then amox
-> resistant to both).
.
In the ED, initial VS - 97.5, 84, 110/81, 20, 92% 4L NC. She
denied CP. PTA patient received 1 ntg spray. Exam notable for
somnolence, decreased BS at right base. Labs notable for INR
2.6, Hct 31.1, Cr 1.3, lactate 1.6. Bcx and Ucx pending. CXR
showing worsening right sided pleural effusion and pulmonary
congestion. EKG showing atrial fibrillation, LAD, LBBB (old),
?ST depressions I, aVL. CT head without focal process. She was
given 600 mg IV linezolid for UTI noted at rehab. She also was
given 750 mg IV levaquin for ?pneumonia. Bipap was attempted,
but her ABG was 7.41/60/108. The ABG, combined with her
somnolence, led to intubation with versed and fentanyl. She
dropped her pressures to SBP 60-70, and a CVL was placed in the
ED. She is admitted for CHF exacerbation and SIRS.
.
Access -  2 piv, CVL
.
ROS: as per HPI. Per daughter, patient's speech has been garbled
in past (required neuro c/s last admission). She is also "loopy"
with torsemide, and is therefore on lasix. No recent chest pain,
cough, sputum, dysuria, abdominal pain, fevers, chills, nausea,
vomitting, neurologic symptoms such as focal weakness, black
outs, or recent seizures. Denies sick contacts or recent travel.

STUDIES:
CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2155-3-29**]
IMPRESSION:
1. Worsening right-sided pleural effusion. Stable left-sided
pleural effusion with retrocardiac opacity which may represent
combindation of effusion and atelectasis, underlying
consolidation can not be excluded.
Mild pulmonary edema.
2. Stable cardiomegaly and widened mediastinum, status post
surgery.

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2155-3-29**]
IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial process. Chronic involutional
changes.

Portable TTE (Complete) Done [**2155-3-31**]
Conclusions
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or
color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The
left ventricular cavity size is normal. Regional left
ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Tissue Doppler imaging
suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure
(PCWP>18mmHg). There is no ventricular septal defect. The right
ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with normal free wall
contractility. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. A
bioprosthetic aortic valve prosthesis is present. The aortic
valve prosthesis appears well seated, with normal leaflet/disc
motion and transvalvular gradients. The mitral valve leaflets
are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate to
severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is moderate
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. [In the setting of at
least moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation, the estimated
pulmonary artery systolic pressure may be underestimated due to
a very high right atrial pressure.] There is no pericardial
effusion.

Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable
for review) of [**2155-3-11**], no change.


Brief Hospital Course:
# Respiratory Distress: Patient intubated in the ED due to
somnolence and respiratory distress.  The patient was easily
extubated after arrival to the MICU and BIPAP used for 1 day.
Given her diastolic CHF, history of pulmonary edema, lower
extremity edema, weight gain, and interstitial fluid on CXR,
most likely etiology was felt to be volume overload, pulmonary
edema.  There was an unclear precipitant, we considered
worsening valvular disease, ECHO showed moderate to severe (3+)
mitral regurgitation and moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid
regurgitation.  ACS was felt to be less likely given
radiographic findings and lack of chest pain with negative
biomarkers. In addition, she had a recent cardiac cath ([**2155-2-11**])
with normal coronaries. PE also felt to be less likely given
lack of pleuritic chest pain, lack of tachycardia, and alternate
explanation on radiograph. Pneumonia also seemed unlikely lack
of fevers, cough, sputum, sick contacts, and focal infiltrate on
CXR.  Patient was placed on a lasix drip and diuresed net -4L
over two days and then lasix drip was transitioned to 40 IV BID
of lasix and the patient continued to have good urine output and
was able to wean down to 3L 02. Cardiology was consulted and
agreed with aggressive diuresis. She was transitioned to the
floor and diuresis was continued with IV Lasix boluses initially
with good effect. She was transitioned to 80mg PO Lasix daily
for 4 days prior to discharge. PT [**Hospital 13131**] rehab placement,
however the family refused as she had bounced back twice from
rehab for CHF exacerbations. She was ultimately discharged home
with VNA and telemonitoring on 80mg of Lasix daily. She was on
room air at time of discharge with minimal pedal edema.

# Hypercarbia: The patient had serial VBGs in the ICU with PCO2
in
