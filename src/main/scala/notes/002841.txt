fever/chills

History of Present Illness:
Pt is a 63 yo male with a h/o Type II DM, CAD s/p 4v CABG [**2129**]
and Ulcerative Colitis who p/w fever/chills/NS/weight loss and
enlarging peri-portal lymph nodes on abdominal CT concerning for
a new diagnosis of lymphoma.
.
Pt was recently admitted [**Date range (1) 19970**]/07 for abdominal pain, fevers,
and weight loss of 20 pounds in the last year, and in the
work-up was found to have multiple enlarging lymph nodes on
abdominal CT, the largest being a 1.6cm peri-portal LN. Pt was
discharged [**1-11**] and saw Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 572**] in GI on [**1-13**], who felt the LAD
was less likely infection, and more likely lymphoma, especially
if the fever persisted on antibiotics. The pt was supposed to
have an appointment with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] this AM, but came to the ED
because he was feeling weak, tired and febrile at home. Now
admitted to the BMT service to expedite work-up for lymphoma.
.
Of note, pt was also admitted from [**Date range (1) 19971**] for
hyperglycemia to 900s, thought to be [**2-7**] non-compliance with
insulin [**2-7**] low PO intake [**2-7**] N/V thought to be [**2-7**] diabetic
gastroparesis.
.
Currently pt has no pain at rest. He notes that he has had chest
"discomfort" for weeks, which correlates to when he gets his
fevers. The pain is non-radiating, feels like a pressure and is
worse with inspiration. Pain/fever gets better with tylenol. No
positional/food relationship to pain, but when he coughs, he
gets the pain. His cough is non-productive and has been
relatively stable over the last few weeks. The pain and coughing
was very intense overnight, which brought him into the ED this
AM.
.
He also notes occasional epigastric discomfort that is also not
related to food/position/chest pain/fevers that he has also had
for weeks but goes away on its own.

CT chest [**2144-1-16**]:
IMPRESSION:  The lung findings primarily in the right lung may
have an infectious etiology given the recent cough and fever and
may represent atypical pneumonia such as mycoplasma or viral
pneumonia.  Pulmonary lymphoma is less likely given the rapid
development of these findings.  Lymphadenopathy may be reactive,
however, lymphoma cannot be excluded and a followup chest CT
eight weeks after antibiotic therapy is recommended.
.
Bm Bx [**1-20**]:
Morphologic features of a lymphoma, infectious process, or a
myelodysplastic syndrome are not seen.  A lymph node biopsy,
however, demonstrated focal infiltration by ALK-1 POSITIVE
ANAPLASTIC LARGE T CELL (CD30+, CD4+, CD3+/-) LYMPHOMA.
Immunostains in the bone marrow to rule out minimal involvement
by lymphoma are in progress and will be reported in an
addendum.In summary the morphologic and immunophenotypic
findings combined, are consistent with focal nodal infiltration
by an anaplastic large cell lymphoma. Although the differential
diagnosis includes Hodgkin lymphoma, the lack of
classic/diagnostic [**Doctor Last Name **]-Sternberg cells, the presence of rather
cohesive aggregates of large cells, the presence of CD45, ALK-1
and CD4 immunoreactivity and lack of CD15 expression, all
strongly argue against Hodgkin lymphoma.

CTA chest [**2144-1-22**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. No pulmonary embolism.
2. Unchanged abnormally enlarged mediastinal and hilar lymph
nodes, probably reactive to the consolidative changes in the
lungs. However, followup chest CT after eight weeks of therapy
is recommended to assess the improvement.
3. Previously seen ground-glass opacities in the upper lobes as
well as in the left lower lobe have evolved to form areas of
consolidation. Small bilateral pleural effusions, left greater
than right. \
.
CXR [**1-22**]:
FINDINGS: Compared with [**2144-1-19**], there is now diffuse increase
in pulmonary vascular and interstitial markings bilaterally,
consistent with moderate pulmonary edema.
A superimposed small area of consolidation in the right mid lung
field as well as in the retrocardiac left lower lobe could
represent superimposed pneumonia.

ECHO [**1-22**]:
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses and
cavity size are normal. There is mild regional left ventricular
systolic
dysfunction with focal hypokinesis of the basal half of the
inferior and
inferolateral walls and of the distal septum. The remaining
segments contract
well. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good
leaflet
excursion and no aortic regurgitation. T
