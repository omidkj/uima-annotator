Date of Birth:  [**2129-8-24**]             Sex:   F

Service: SURGERY

Allergies:
Vancomycin / Iodine; Iodine Containing / Meropenem / Ceftriaxone
/ Ciprofloxacin / Flagyl

Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 4659**]
Chief Complaint:
Abdominal pain


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
1.Exploratory laparotomy, sigmoid resection, Hartmann procedure
and   end-colostomy.
2. Intra-abdominal drain placement, then removal on [**2193-2-22**]


History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 63-year-old female with past medical history
significant for  atrial fibrillation, hyperlipidemia, asthma,
hypertension, diet-controlled type II diabetes mellitus,
myocardial infarction with PCI (RCA stent in [**2192-5-17**]),
status-post CABG x1 ([**2192-7-31**])and a history of Acute Myelogenous
Leukemia with allogenic bone marrow transplant done [**3-/2191**], on
regular low dose steroids for GVHD of the skin s/p BMT, who
presented on [**2193-1-19**] complaining of [**1-18**] days of "crampy" lower
abdominal pains. The pain was acute in onset over a 1 day
period. She denied any associated fevers, chills. No
accompanying nausea or emesis, and she also denied any pain with
urination.
.
Of relevance, Mrs. [**Known lastname **]  has known diverticulosis which was
identified on a colonoscopy about four years ago. Other
pertinent GI related conditions include her history of abdominal
pains and diarrhea which eventually led to the discovery of
C.difficile colitis back in [**2191-3-17**]. She states she had a
recurrence of her C.difficile again in [**5-/2191**] but was then
effectively treated and her symptoms had completely resolved.
.
Due to her severe abdominal cramping and pains, she was
initially observed in the ICU setting with the intention to
manage her conservatively with medications and supportive
therapy as she was felt to be a poor surgical candidate given
her previous cancer and cardiac history and being on ASA and
Plavix on admission.

ADDITIONAL CARDIOLOGY REPORTS/STUDIES:
[**2193-1-19**] EKG : rate 77, Sinus rhythm. Left axis deviation and
diffuse ST-T wave changes in the anterolateral leads. Compared
to the previous tracing of [**2192-11-8**] the ST-T wave changes are
slightly more apparent and the other findings are similar.
.
[**2193-1-22**] EKG: Rate 128, Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular
response. Leftward axis. Inferior myocardial infarction, age
undetermined. There is somewhat early R wave progression. ST-T
wave abnormalities in the precordial leads. Since the previous
tracing of [**2193-1-21**] atrial fibrillation is new. Clinical
correlation is suggested.
.
[**2193-1-29**] EKG : rate 58-60, Baseline artifact. Sinus bradycardia.
Inferior wall myocardial infarction. ST-T wave abnormalities.
Since the previous tracing of [**2193-1-22**] atrial fibrillation with
rapid ventricular response is no longer seen.
.

ADDITIONAL IMAGING STUDIES:
[**2193-1-19**] CT ABDOMEN AND PELVIS W/O CONTRAST:
1. Small amount of pneumoperitoneum anteriorly and also around
the liver.
Small pelvic free fluid also tracking up along the right
paracolic gutter.
Extensive colonic diverticulosis, with mild stranding
surrounding a loop of
sigmoid colon in the left lower quadrant suggesting sigmoid
diverticulitis as possible source for perforation. The appendix
appears normal throughout its length.
2. Cholelithiasis.
3. Atherosclerotic disease.
.
.
[**2193-1-19**] PORTABLE CXR: The cardiomediastinal silhouette is
unremarkable. The lungs are clear. There is no free air under
the diaphragm. There is stable deformity of one of the right
ribs, likely related to old trauma or surgical intervention.
CONCLUSION: No acute cardiopulmonary process. No air under the
diaphragm.

.
[**2193-1-23**] CXR : New right picc line with tip in proximal svc.
Intraperitoneal air remains, possibly with slight increase vs
redistribution. Minimal retrocardiac opacity c/w atelectasis
however minimal infectious vs inflammatory process cannot be
excluded.
.

[**2193-1-24**] CT ABD/PELVIS W/O CONTRAST FINDINGS:
Visualized portions of the lung bases are unchanged from the
previous study. There is no pleural or pericardial effusion.
Coronary arterial calcification is also noted. A moderate-sized
pneumoperitoneum is enlarged since [**1-19**]. A small amount of
free-fluid is also seen, predominantly in a perihepatic location
as well as a second collection at the base of the mesentery
(2:49). The unenhanced liver, spleen, pancreas, adrenal glands
and kidneys are unremarkable. Note is made of a gallstone within
an otherwise unremarkable gallbladder, unchanged.
Atherosclerotic calcification is noted along the abdominal aorta
and its arterial branches and note is also made of aortic
ectasia. Scattered mesenteric and retroperitoneal lymph nodes
are visualized, none of which meet CT criteria for pathologic
enlargement.
The previously described area of thickening along the sigmoid
colon in the
area of known diverticulosis is again visualized, and there is
also
extraluminal leak of oral contrast. This extralumi
