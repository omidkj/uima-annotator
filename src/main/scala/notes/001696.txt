Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 30**]
Chief Complaint:
hypoxia and hypotension

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
right femoral line placement

History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **]F with [**Hospital 10224**] medical problems including diastolic CHF (EF
55%), CAD, CRI, Afib who presented to ED in acute respiratory
distress. The patient was recently hospitalized several times at
[**Hospital1 2177**], including in [**2156-5-9**], during which time she underwent
cardiac catheterization for CHF, s/p stent to 90% mid-LAD
lesion. Most recently, pt was in hospital [**Date range (1) 10232**] for CHF
exacerbation. Pt reports doing well at home since discharge but
does report mild URI Symptoms (rhinorrhea and nonproductive
cough) and some "sweats" during the past few nights (but no
"sweats" during the day).
.
For the past 1-2 days, the pt missed all of her medications
including lasix because her daughter, who keeps track of her
medications, was out of town. Last night, the patient was
breathing comfortably when she was going to bed but awoke at
midnight with diaphoresis and shortness of breath which improved
somewhat with albuterol and pt was able to fall back asleep. Pt
then awoke numerous times throughout the night due to SOB and
this progressed despite using albuterol MDIs so pt called EMS.
.
EMS noted BP 180/110, HR 104, RR 32, sat 94% on NRB. En route to
ED, received 3 SL NTG and 80 IV lasix with minimal improvement
and only diuresed 200 cc. In [**Name (NI) **], pt was unable to speak in full
sentances. CXR confirmed increased perihilar haziness and
interstitial prominence, bilateral effusions consistent with CHF
but also with right lung haziness concerning for PNA. Pt was
placed on nitro gtt, given 2 mg morphine, Levofloxacin and
Ceftriaxone for empiric coverage and placed on BIPAP. Pt felt
symptomatically improved with BIPAP, then changed to 50%
ventimask with sats low 90s, ABG 7.39/40/101. Pt then admitted
to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for further monitoring.
.
Upon arrival to [**Name (NI) 153**], pt reported feeling "much better" and her
breathing was "almost normal." Pt denied F/C, diarrhea (is in
fact constipated), CP, palpitations, orthopnea (sleeps on 2
pillows but prefers to sleep flat), PND, or increased LE edema.
Denied dietary indiscretions. Denied DOE & is able to walk
(w/walker) about her apt w/o stopping.
.
ICU course:
~ Respiratory distress thought to be multifactorial with
pulmonary edema secondary to discontinuation of lasix being the
main triggering factor. Other factors included COPD exacerbation
in setting of volume overload and possible pneumonia.  Her
pneumonia was treated with ceftriaxone and azithromycin which
was later changed to levaquin/azithro.  She was started on
solumedrol and standing nebulizers.  Pt had several episodes of
respiratory distress, all of which improved with nebs and BiPAP.
 She was given prn Lasix with a goal of keeping patient one
liter negative per day.
~ Her BP ran low thought to be due to poor forward flow but she
was never on pressors.
~ Creatinine rose and urine output fell despite lasix.  Urine
lytes revealed a FeNa of <1% indicating that pt's CHF was likely
contributing to poor renal perfusion.  Further lasix doses were
held given that pt appeared intravascularly dry.
~ Pt's hct remained low during her ICU but pt refused PRBC
transfusion because of an episode of respiratory distress that
the pt had after receiving a transfusion at [**Hospital1 2177**].

** CXR: Findings consistent with CHF with small bilateral
pleural effusions.
.
** ECHO:
The left atrium is elongated. The right atrium is moderately
dilated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Due to suboptimal
technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be
fully excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
low normal (LVEF 55%). [Intrinsic left ventricular systolic
function may be more depressed given the severity of valvular
regurgitation.] Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The
aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is mild
aortic valve stenosis. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate (2+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the
severity of mitral regurgitation may be significantly
UNDERestimated.] The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.


Brief Hospital Course:
[**Age over 90 **] yr old female with hx of CAD, dCHF, COPD, anemia, CRF
admitted for respiratory distress.
.
1. Respiratory Distress: Etiology likely multifactorial
including acute pulm edema, asthma/bronchospasm and
tracheobronchomalacia.  There was initally concern for pneumonia
so she was given several days of ceftriaxone and azithromycin
for CAP.  These were stopped once it was clear that she had no
pneumonia.  There was also a question of upper airway
obstruction given pt's multiple prior intubations so PFTs were
done but were unrevealing as pt was unable to cooperate with
testing.  A CT of the trachea showed moderate to severe
tracheobronchomalacia.  Given her tracheobronchomalacia and CHF,
she was given BiPAP at night in the ICU to relieve episodes of
respiratory distress.  She was started on steroids for a COPD
flare but these were stopped soon after her transfer to the
floor.  She was continued on her flovent and nebs.  To treat her
CHF, she was diuresed gently in the ICU but this was held once
her creatinine started to rise.  Diuresis was reinitiated on the
floor and she diuresed approximately one liter per day. On HD
#7, she was breathing comfortably on room air.
.
2. CHF: An echocardiogram during this admission showed an EF of
55% but an E/A ratio of 2.8 indicating diastolic heart failure.
As above, she was diuresed to her dry weight and she was
continued on her beta-blocker.
.
3. Paroxysmal Afib: Pt has not been coumadinized in past due to
risk for falls.  She was rate controlled w
