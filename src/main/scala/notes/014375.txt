History of Present Illness:
85yo woman w recent dx PE, refractory HTN, DM, CKD (bl Cr
1.4-1.6), anemia who presents from NH with increasing SOB. Per
NH records, she became febrile to 103 w HR 79, BP 180, O2 sat

CT CHEST W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2187-6-25**] 11:32 AM
HRCT OF THE CHEST: New non-hemorrhagic bilateral pleural
effusions, small to moderate on the left and small on the right,
have resulted in near-complete collapse of the left lower lobe
and less extensive atelectasis in the right lower lobe. Two
nodular opacities in the lingula may be atelectasis or a small
regions of infection. A more wedge-shaped consolidative opacity
at the right lung apex could be infection or infarction. Diffuse
moderate ground- glass opacities and interlobular septal
thickening reflect volume overload. There is no evidence of
fibrosis.
Heart size is top normal. There is no pericardial effusion.
Atherosclerotic calcification is extensive--in the coronary
arteries, aortic root, and aorta and extending into the carotid
and subclavian arteries. Dystrophic calcification of the mitral
valve annulus could be hemodynamically signficiant since the
left atrium is dilated. Pulmonary arterial size is also top
normal. Left PICC tip in the right atrium, is 3.5 cm below the
SVC- right atrial junction. A precarinal node is 10 mm wide
(2:32); no other nodes are pathologically enlarged.
This exam is not tailored for subdiaphragmatic assessment. The
imaged
portion of the unenhanced upper abdomen is normal.
There are no concerning osseous lesions.
IMPRESSION:
1. New moderate cardiac decompensation manifested in bilateral
pleural
effusions and interstitial and alveolar edema.
2. Small areas of right apical and lingular infection or
infarction.
3. No pulmonary fibrosis

CHEST PORT. LINE PLACEMENT Study Date of [**2187-6-23**] 11:55 AM
FINDINGS: Comparison is made to previous study from [**2187-6-22**].
There is a left-sided PICC line with distal lead tip in the
cavoatrial
junction. No pneumothoraces are seen. There is a persistent
left-sided
retrocardiac opacity and left-sided pleural effusion, stable.

Brief Hospital Course:
85yo woman with hx of recent bilat PE, refractory HTN, DM, CKD
here with worsening DOE.  Was admitted to the ICU [**Date range (1) 23465**],
transferred to floor [**6-23**]:

# fever/ e.coli bacteremia/ UTI: Had positive U/A, grew E.coli
sensitive only to meropenem in blood and urine cultures.
Initially on broad spectrum antibiotics, but switched to
meropenem on [**6-21**] and had improvement in fever curve and mental
status.  Meropenum course complete [**7-4**].
