Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 905**]
Chief Complaint:
found down

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
78M with diastolic CHF EF 45%, CAD s/p MI in [**2122**], PAF on
coumadin, severe AS (valce area 0.8, peak gradient 55),
epilepsy, DM-II, and elephantisis who presents after being found
down by neighbors. The patient reports that he has difficulty
ambulating at baseline and is chornically short of breath. The
night prior to admission he reports waking up on the floor and
unable to get up. He cannot recall falling or any particular
symptoms prior to falling. He denies CP, DOE, or palpitations
prior to falling. He denies incontinence or being excessively
tired or weak after waking up. He denies hitting his head, only
his L elbow. He denies past falls. He reports lying on the floor
all night and was found when neighbors heard him calling. He
endorses worsening SOB for several days after not taking lasix
[**3-13**] difficulty getting to the bathroom. He reports that he had
some fleeting, non-radiating, substernal CP during the night on
the floor but no pain like his past MI. He reports some chills
that night but no dysuria, cough, sputum production, or malaise.
He also complains of chronic LE pain which is has had for 13
years but is no worse now.
.
Of note, he was hospitalized at [**Hospital1 18**] in [**4-17**] for COPD and CHF
exacerbation [**3-13**] non-compliance with Lasix. He was diuresed and
placed on fluid restriction. Lisinopril was decreased [**3-13**]
hypotension and NTG was d/c'ed [**3-13**] AS.
.
In the ED his vital signs were Temp 97.8 HR 88 BP 123/60 RR12
Pox 98%. The patient complained of pain in his left arm, left
knee, right knee as well as chronic SOB and no CP. He was given
Unasyn and Vanc for cellultis. He was also given a 500mL bolus.
EKG showed first degree AV conduction delay but no ischemia. His
TnT was elevated with a low MB fraction and he was given ASA
325mg. He was admitted to the MICU for close monitoring.
.
In the MICU he was restarted on his Lasix with 40mg IV in place
of his home dose of 80mg PO (which he may or may not have been
taking). His antibiotics were changed to vancomycin and pip/tazo
for a history of MRSA wound infection and Pseudomonas UTI. He
improved clinically and did quite well. Of note, his phenytoin
level was subtherapeutic at 2.1 and he was in [**Last Name (un) **] with a Cr of
1.8 which fell to 1.4 overnight. His TnT rose to 0.74 from 0.30.
His BNP was [**Numeric Identifier **] from a baseline of 3792 in [**4-17**].
.
At this time he reports ongoing orthopnea and SOB improved from
prior to admission. He denies CP, F/C/SW, cough, or dysuria. He
is speaking in full sentences and able to give his history,
although complicated by poor English.

Brief Hospital Course:
78M with dCHF with EF45%, CAD s/p MI in [**2122**], PAF on coumadin,
AS (valve area 0.8, peak gradient 55), COPD, elephantisis,
eplipsy, and medication non-compliance who presents after being
found down. Initially seen in the MICU. TnT fluctuated but CP
free and no ECG changes. CKs initially elevated with low MB
fraction consistent with some degree of rhabdomyolysis. [**Last Name (un) **]
resolved. SOB improved with nebs and diuresis. UTI ultimately
grew ESBL Klebsiella. He was discharged on Bactrim to home with
VNA after refusing rehab.
.
# Pyelynephritis: WBC 22 on admission. PNA vs cellulitis vs UTI
vs septic joint. Abd benign and knee pain is stable and chronic.
CXR more consistent with CHF exacerbation. LE edema believed to
be [**3-13**] elphantiasis. UA consistent with UTI. UA positive with
>50 WBC. BCx negative but febrile on admission. Initially
received vancomycin, which was discontinued on transfer to
Medicine. Continued Piperacillin-Tazobactam Na 4.5 g IV Q8H for
empiric coverage of GNRs in urine until UCx grew Klebsiella with
ESBL but sensitive to Bactrim. He was discharged on a total of
14 days of antibiotics. He was afebrile at discharge and
