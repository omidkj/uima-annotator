Brief Hospital Course:
[**Age over 90 **] year old woman with diastolic CHF, hyperlipidemia,
hypothyroidism, PMR, & CKD presented with dyspnea, cough, fever,
found to have Right lower lobe infiltrate consistent with
Pneumonia was initially admitted to the ICU then transferred to
the medical floor that was treated with antibiotics, found to
have hypertension that required uptitration and addition of
anti-hypertensive agents. She was discharged home with PT based
on the patient's and daughter's preference though the optimal
would be rehab for a short time.
.
Active Diagnoses:
# Pneumonia: The patient presented with upper respiratory
symptoms x 2 days, and subsequent dyspnea, fever, productive
cough, and lethargy. She was brought to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED where she
was found to be hypoxic, requiring 3-4L NC, with a right lower
lobe infiltrate consistent with pneumonia. Given the location of
infiltrate and history of aspiration events, this likely
represents an aspiration pneumonia.  Given her recent
hospitalization in [**4-/2129**], she was treated for initially for
possible  HCAP with vanc/zosyn. This was switched to levaquin
(stayed 2 days about 3 week ago). To be taken for a total of 7
days through [**2129-6-10**]. While in the ICU, her O2 was weaned as
tolerated to 1L NC.  Blood cultures no growth to date.  Of note,
patient and family are aware of her ongoing aspiration risk,
however they wish for her to continue taking her home feeding
regimen despite risk of further aspiration events. She was
eventually weaned off oxygen and was maintaining normal oxygen
saturation on room air with improvement in her breathing and
overall status.
.
# Hypertension: The patient overall had SBP of 140-180's
throughout her stay. Her Carvedilol was increased to 12.5 mg
twice daily with lowest heart rate of 60 beat per minute. Also,
amlodipine 5 mg was started on the day of discharge. Given her
chronic kidney disease, thiazides and ACEi's are not considered.

.
# Chronic Left lower extremity DVT: Continued home warfarin 2mg
daily. INR was 4.1 a few days ago so warfarin held for 2 days.
INR 2.7 on last ICU day, so warfarin was restarted but at 1 mg
daily dose since she was initiated on levaquin as above. Her
discharge INR was 2.7. [**Hospital **] clinic was notified
