Allergies:

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2145**]
Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Thoracentesis.


History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 7049**] is an 80 year-old woman with a history of COPD, severe
pulmonary artery hypertension, atrial fibrillation on Coumadin
and Alzheimer's who initially presented on [**10-16**] with dyspnea,
initially admitted to the ICU, then transitioned to the medical
floor.

Based on review of her record, ICU notes and discussion with
admitting physicians, the day prior to admission, patient's
family called her cardiologist to report worsening dypsnea while
sleeping and after showering. Lasix was increased without relief
so she presented to an outside hospital. There she was found to
have large pleural effusions.

Upon transfer to [**Hospital1 18**], initial thoracentesis was deferred given
INR >2.0. She was noted to have a WBC of 14.7 and a positive UA,
and she receieved Levofloxacin and Vancomycin empirically.

After arrival to the floor, patient triggered for respiratory
distress with a recorded respiratory rate of 34 and increased
work of breathing; an ABG showed 7.47/47/97. After little
improvement with lasix and increasing O2 requirement, she was
transferred to the ICU.

ICU course: After receiving 5mg vitamin K and FFP, underwent
thoracentesis with removal of 1800cc of serous fluid. BP
initially dropped to 60/50 after [**Female First Name (un) 576**], then improving to 80/50
within one minute. Results were consistent with transudative
effusion. Dyspnea improved, as did initial chest film though
repeat film showed reaccumulation of fluid.

In addition, while in the MICU, she was transiently hypotensive
(as low as a recorded value of 59/43); as such, she received no
doses of verapamil and just one dose of lasix. HR ranged from
70s up to low 100s.

Her breathing and BP stabilized, and she was transferred to the
medical floor.  On the medical floor.

ECG: Atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response.
Leftward axis. Consider inferior myocardial infarction. Right
bundle-branch block. Since the previous tracing of [**2188-9-12**] the
rate has increased.

CXR ([**2188-10-16**]): Increased size of bilateral pleural effusions,
right greater than left with bilateral lower lobe opacities,
which may represent atelectasis, although an underlying
pneumonia cannot be excluded.

CXR ([**2188-10-17**]; post [**Female First Name (un) 576**]): In comparison with study of [**10-16**],
there has been a dramatic decrease in the right pleural
effusion. No evidence of pneumothorax.

CXR ([**2188-10-17**]): In comparison with the study of [**10-17**], there has
been increased opacification in the right lower lung zone
consistent with the re-accumulation of pleural fluid. There is a
linear stripe running along the right lateral chest wall in the
mid and low end lower lung zones. It is unclear whether this
represents a pneumothorax, since it does not extend to the apex
and there is the vague suggestion of lung markings lateral to it
that suggests merely a skin fold.

CXR ([**2188-10-20**]): Increase in the amount of right pleural fluid
compared to the prior study with stable right and left lower
lobe opacities and mild pulmonary vascular congestion.

CXR ([**2188-10-21**]): IMPRESSION: Little change

ECHO ([**2188-10-17**]):
- left atrium is elongated
- mild symmetric LVH
- LVEF>55%
- RV cavity mildly dilated with mild global free wall
hypokinesis (there is abnormal septal motion/position consistent
with right ventricular pressure/volume overload
- partial mitral leaflet flail with moderate to severe (3+) MR
- severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension
- trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
This is an 80 y.o. female, which severe (3+) MR, severe
pulmonary hypertension (likely as a result), who presented with
worsened dyspnea and pleural effusions.

# Dyspnea/Pleural effusions:  Primary cause of dyspnea likely
the large pulmonary effusions, which are most likely secondary
to severe mitral reguritation and pulmonary HTN.  Symptoms
improved greatly after thoracentesis though this was transient
as the fluid reaccumulated.  Repeat echo showed severe MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 29618**]m htn, not significantly changed from prior echo.  She was
diuresed but this was difficult with blood pressure in the
90s-100s systolic.  Afterload has been attempted on an admission
in [**7-25**], though lisinopril was stopped on a subsequent
outpatient follow-up due to relateive hypotension.  A
conversation with her outpatient cardiologist revealed that she
is a poor surgical candidate for MVR given her advanced
dementia.  A discussed about percutaneous MV repair followed;
this procedure is not performed at [**Hospital1 18**] and not by any
experiened physician in [**Name9 (PRE) 86**].  Given the risk of such a
procedure, unknown amount of benefit, and likely stress on the
patient to travel to have such a procedure performed, her family
and outpatient cardiologist opted not to pursue this.  Goals of
care were addressed and her family (HCP is daughter [**Name (NI) **])
decided that her comfort was the primary goal.  She was set up
for home hospice, and given morphine prn for shortness of
breath.  Supplemental oxygen was continued and she will go home
on it.   She was made DNR/DNI.

# Positive blood cultures:  GPC in [**1-21**] bottles, treated with
vancomycin until speciated as multiple species of coag neg staph
as well as strep.  It was felt this was likely a contaminent,
and vancomycine stopped after 3 days.  She had no further fever
or evidence of bacteremia.

# Urinary tract infection:  Urine culture grew Ppansensitive
e.coli treated with ciprofloxacin x 7 days.  Course completed
[**2188-10-22**].

# Atrial Fibrillation:  Given relative hypotension, verapamil
was held early in course with heart rates running in the high
90s / low 100s.  Coumadin was held peri-[**Female First Name (un) 576**] and restarted
afterwards.  As her BP improved, she w
