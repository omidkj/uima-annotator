Chief Complaint:
hypoxia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **] yo F with history of COPD, CHF sent from [**Hospital 102735**] rehab with
worsening SOB, and hypoxia. Lasix recently decreased because
urinating too much. Per report at [**Hospital 100**] rehab, patient was
found at 1am sleeping on the floor without obvious injury. The
day of admission she was agitated, uncooperative wtih staff, and
delirious. 02 saturation 76% on RA upto 92% on 4L. She has had
severe anxiety this week and started lorazepam prn 4 days ago.
She received 0.5 mg today at 10:50 AM.
.
In the ED, initial vs were: 99.2 66 153/80 22 96%. She was in
atrial fibrillation. Labs notable for BNP of 7024. ABG pH 7.40
pCO2 57 pO2 137 HCO3 37. CXR was concerning for fluid overload -
cant r/o PNA. Patient was given Albuterol Neb,Ipratropium
Bromide Neb, Levofloxacin 750mg, Furosemide 40mg,
MethylPREDNISolone Sodium Succ 125mg, Vancomycin 1g. She was
started on Bipap in the ED. She was given Ativan 2mg IV x2 for
anxiety/agitation, and 4mg IV morphine x2. Prior to transfer, P
70 BP155/65 R O2 sat 96 on bipap 10/4 28% FiO2.

.
On the floor, the patient is sleepy, with BIPAP mask on. While
being moved, she was more awake and agitated.

.
CXR: Limited study with mild pulmonary vascular congestion.
Limited
evaluation of the lung bases.

ECHO: The left and right atria are moderately dilated. There is
moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal
cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
The estimated cardiac index is normal (>=2.5L/min/m2). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are
normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
There is no aortic valve stenosis. Mild (1+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
structurally normal. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. There
is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
preserved global and regional biventricular systolic function.
Pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. Mild aortic
regurgitation.

VIDEO SWALLOW STUDY: Penetration with thin and nectar
consistency. No aspiration. Very slow passage of contrast
through the thoracic esophagus into the stomach with numerous
tertiary waves seen.


Brief Hospital Course:
[**Age over 90 **] yo F with a history of COPD and CHF who presents with hypoxia
and SOB, consistent with pulmonary edema.

#dCHF EXACERBATION: Physical exam and CXR consistent with
pulmonary edema. Likely because lasix dose was recently
decreased. Patient's new ativan medication could have
potentially make her hypercarbic, but shouldn't contribute to
hypoxemia. She was afebrile and without leukocytosis. She
received 1 dose of Levofloxacin in the ED. The patient was
admitted to the MICU with respiratory distress and agitation.
She was placed on BiPAP intermittently overnight but continued
to remove the mask. Her SpO2 was at baseline. She continued to
remain agitated but was somewhat redirectable. Swallow consult
placed and lasix 60mg PO daily ordered on day of transfer out of
MICU. Patient continued to improved and had no shortness of
breath while on the floor. Her ECHO demonstrated The left and
right atria are moderately dilated. There is moderate symmetric
left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and
regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). The estimated
cardiac index is normal (>=2.5L/min/m2). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The diameters of
aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal.
In conclusion, we recommend not decreasing the current lasix
dose in this patient. She will need this dose titrated in the
future to make sure she does not become volume overloaded again.

# Anxiety: Patient had been suffering from this anxiety for
several years. In hospital it was initially controlled with
alprazolam. However, she was evaluated by inpatient psychiatry
who recommended to d/c alprazolam and use 0.25 mg lorazepam TID
(about equivalent to the 0.125 mg alprazolam TID prn she had
beenreceiving at [**Hospital 100**] Rehab before recent increases).

INACTIVE ISSUES:
# Hypothyroidism: Continued synthroid.
# Atrial fibrillation: Rate well controlled. Allergic to beta
blockers. Not anticoagulated, likely because of history of
frequent falls.
#COPD  - stable
- albuterol neb
- fluticasone nasal spray
- Fluticasone/salmeterol discus
#Code: DNR,DNI. Confirmed with HCP, patient
#Communication: Patient. Pt's daughter in [**Name (NI) 108**]: [**Name (NI) 102736**]
[**Name (NI) **] HCP - [**Telephone/Fax (1) 102737**]

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
#Hypothyroidism - per psych, patient will need outpatient workup
of her hypothyroidism. PCP may need to reevaluate the
