Brief Hospital Course:
In the CCU he received the following
Aspirin 325 mg PO QD
Atorvastatin 40 mg PO QD
Calcium Gluconate 35 Meq/HR IV Q1H equivlant to 7-8gm/hr
Clopidogrel Bisulfate 75 mg PO QD
Dextran 40 (10% Solution)-500 ml NS Continuous at 100 ml/hr
Dopamine 5-20 mcg/kg/min IV
Epinephrine HCl 0.01-0.14 mcg/kg/min IV
Golytely 2 L PO Q1H
Insulin 70 UNIT/HR IV
Norepinephrine 0.3-0.5 mcg/kg/min IV
Pantoprazole 40 mg IV Q24H
Phenylephrine HCl 0.5-5 mcg/kg/min IV

In the CCU he remained intubated, on multiple pressors, as well
as insulin drip (70units/hr) with D10W for CCB toxicity.  His
pressures slowly improved and he was weaned off the pressors.
He was extubated on [**6-10**] without event.  He was significantly
volume positive (+17 L) d/t D10W, and he required diuresis with
IV lasix, to which he responded well.  His WBC was elevated and
CXR was suggestive of possible PNA, and he was started on
Levaquin x 7 days on [**6-11**].

Initial Labs:
BP94/55, T94.5, HR90, RR22
7.28/36/142
Na=141, K=3.6, Cl=114, CO2=17, BUN=12, Cr=1.9, Gluc=50
WBC=25, Hct 41.1, Plt=326,
PT=13, PTT=23.7, INR=1.1
lactate=1.4

CXR:  Heart size and mediastinal contours are within normal
limits for technique. An ET tube is present at the thoracic
inlet, 2 to 3 cm above the carina. NG tube reaches the stomach.
Intersitital markings are prominent, but there is no pleural
effusion or pneumothorax. A right subclavian central venous line
is noted, the tip of which reaches a subclavian central venous
line is noted, the
tip of which reaches the brachiocephalus-SVC junction. The bones
are grossly unremarkable. IMPRESSION: Tube and lines in
satisfactory position.

KUB:  Not suggestive of SBO.

O/N: we repleted his K and Mg.  Weaned off norepinephrine,
phenylephrine, and dopamine.  Difficulty with golytely through
NG tube may have aspirated. Magnesium citrate was also attempted
with similar difficulty.  About 500 cc of stool was removed by
enema.

PUMP: EF 50%
RHTHYM: temporary pacer, monitor tele, daily EKG
CAD: continue [**Month/Year (2) **], atorvastatin, clopidogrel
CCB+BB DETOX:
--pacer--counter bradycardia
--bowel irrigation--Toprol XL could continue to adsorb for
24hrs.
--calcium tx--increase ionotropy
--hyperinsulinemic/euglycemic tx--increase glucose to myocytes,
and insulin may directly increase Ca release from SR
BENZO DETOX/WITHDRAWAL:
--no specific tx for o/d, monitor signs of withdrawal.
HYPOPHOSPHATEMIA:
--secondary to insulin, epinephrine and respiratory alkalosis,
continue KPO4 infusion with q2h checks
HYPOKALEMIA:
--secondary to insulin and calcium, continue KPO4 infusion with
q2h checks


Medications on Admission:
amlodipine 5 QD
isosorbide mononitrate 30 [**Hospital1 **]
atorvastatin 40 QD
clopidogrel 75 QD
[**Hospital1 **] 325 QD
metoprolol sr 50 QD
fluoxetine 20 QD
protonix 40 QD
escitalopram

Discharge Disposition:
Extended Care

Facility:
 DECONNES 4

Discharge Diagnosis:

Discharge Instructions:
Please let a doctor know if you're having worsened chest pain,
shortness of breath, fever, excessive sweating, palpitations.

Please check potassium level on Fri., [**6-15**], and 1 wk from then.
Adjust KCl repletion accordingly.

Followup Instructions:
Please followup with your PCP and cardiologist in [**11-18**] (have not
been scheduled).  At that time, he can adjust your lasix dose as
well as your potassium repletion.
