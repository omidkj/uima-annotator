HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname 71430**] is a 50-year-old
male, with a past medical history significant for hepatitis
C, portal hypertension, gastric varices, and hepatic
encephalopathy, who underwent a living-related liver
transplant on [**2148-3-5**].  His postoperative course was
notable for hepatorenal syndrome requiring hemodialysis with
extubation on postoperative day #5, and echocardiogram which
demonstrated a decreased ejection fraction at 35%, with 2+
mitral regurgitation on approximately postoperative day #5.
The remainder of his postoperative course was unremarkable,
and he was discharged to the [**Hospital6 310**]
on postoperative day #13.

The patient states that approximately 3-4 days prior to
admission, he was found to have an elevated creatinine level
consistent with cyclosporin toxicity at rehab.  On the
evening prior to admission, the patient was found to have an
elevated oxygen requirement with increased work of breathing,
and was subsequently transferred to the [**Hospital6 649**] for treatment.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Hepatitis C.
2. Portal hypertension.
3. Gastric varices.
4. Hepatic encephalopathy.
5. Status post living-related liver transplantation
[**2148-3-5**].
6. Renal insufficiency.
7. Colitis.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  As above.

MEDICATIONS AT REHAB:
1. Lopressor 25 mg po bid.
2. Lasix 40 mg po bid.
3. Cyclosporin 225 mg po bid.
4. CellCept [**Pager number **] mg po bid.
5. Hydralazine 20 mg po q 6 h.
6. Valcyte 450 mg po qod.
7. Colace 100 mg po bid.
8. Prevacid 30 mg po qd.
9. Prednisone 20 mg po qd.
10.Imdur 30 mg po qd.
11.Bactrim SS qd.
12.Percocet prn pain.

ALLERGIES:  The patient denies any known drug allergies.

FAMILY HISTORY:  The patient has a family history significant
for coronary artery disease and diabetes mellitus.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient denies alcohol use, and states
that he quit smoking in [**2148-1-1**].

PHYSICAL EXAM - VITAL SIGNS:  Temperature 96.6, heart rate
99, blood pressure 165/96, respiratory rate 24, oxygen
saturation 89% on 100% nonrebreather.
GENERAL:  The patient appears to be in severe respiratory
distress with increased work of breathing.
HEART:  Tachy with a regular rhythm.
LUNGS:  Rales bilaterally at the bases.
ABDOMEN:  Well-healing surgical incision with no apparent
drainage.  There is no tenderness, and the Steri-Strips are
clean, dry and intact.
EXTREMITIES:  4+ pitting edema to the thighs.

PERTINENT LABORATORY STUDIES:  WBC 8.8, hematocrit 34.6,
platelet count 250, sodium 131, potassium 5.3, creatinine
3.2, AST 43, ALT 47, INR 1.1, alkaline phosphatase 332, total
bilirubin 5.5, amylase 57, lipase 13, albumin 3.2.

IMAGING:  A chest x-ray done at the time of admission
demonstrated bilateral infiltrates with markings consistent
with CHF.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was seen in the Emergency
Department where he was subsequently intubated and
transferred to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit.  The patient
was immediately placed on a lasix drip for aggressive
diuresis.  Given his elevated creatinine level, his
cyclosporin was held.  The patient was also treated for
hyperkalemia with Kayexalate, insulin, and dextrose.  An
echocardiogram was done which demonstrated, again, an
ejection fraction of 35% without changes from prior study.

On hospital day #3, the patient was weaned from his lasix
drip and was started on intravenous lasix [**Hospital1 **].  His skin
staples were removed at this time, as well.  A central venous
line was placed for poor access into the left subclavian vein
on hospital day #3.  On hospital day #5, the patient was
extubated.  At this time, he was approximately 25 liters
negative.

He was subsequently transferred to the floor on hospital day
#6.  He was seen by the physical therapy service to assist
with ambulation and activity.  His Foley catheter was removed
at this time, and his transplant medications were resumed.
The patient's total bilirubin had been elevated throughout
his stay, and a liver ultrasound with biopsy was performed on
hospital day #7.  This study demonstrated questionable
stenosis of the right hepatic artery and was negative for
ejection.  The patient continued to be diuresed, was advanced
to a regular diet, and was receiving physical therapy
treatment until the time of discharge on hospital day #10.
He will be discharged to the [**Hospital6 310**]
for physical therapy and intravenous lasix diuresis.  He will
be discharged with the left subclavian central venous line
until better access is obtained.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Good.

DISCHARGE DISPOSITION:  The patient will be discharged to the
[**Hospital6 310**].

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1. Hepatitis C cirrhosis.
2. Portal hypertension.
3. Gastric varices.
4. Hepatic encephalopathy.
5. Colitis.
6. Renal insufficiency.
7. Status post living-related liver transplantation.
8. Status post acute congestive heart failure episode.
9. Status post central venous line placement.
10.Status post ultrasound-guided liver biopsy.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1. Cyclosporin 75 mg po q 12 h.
2. Fluconazole 400 mg po qd.
3. Furosemide 60 mg IV bid.
4. Hydralazine 20 mg po q 6 h.
5. Insulin as directed per sliding scale.
6. Imdur 30 mg po qd.
7. Pantoprazole 25 mg po bid.
8. CellCept 1,000 mg po bid.
9. Protonix 40 mg po qd.

FOLLOW-UP PLANS:
1. The patient was instructed to follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in
approximately 1 week.
2. He was also instructed to have his labs drawn twice weekly
for CBC, chem-10, LFTs, and cyclosporin levels.
3. He was instructed to follow-up sooner if he developed
fevers greater than 101.5??????F, shortness of breath, or
increased work of breathing.
4. He will be discharged with a left subclavian central
venous line for intravenous access.  Once he is able to have
a peripheral IV established, this line may be removed.
