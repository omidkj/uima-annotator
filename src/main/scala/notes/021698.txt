History of Present Illness:
HPI (per [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] admit note): 58 yo woman with stage IIIb NSCLC
(treated with cisplatin/etoposide x2/XRT/RU lobectomy) most
recently 3 weeks s/p C1 docitaxel ([**6-15**]) w/ dyspnea, fever to

every 5-6 hours (more than usual). She notes worsening cough,
not productive of sputum. She notes intermitent orthopnea and
PND last night only (at time of fever). She denies chest pain,
either exertional or pleuritic. She notes her right arm/shoulder
pain is improved from her [**6-20**] admit. Of note post-lobectomy was
on home O2 2L NC which was stopped on last admit ([**Date range (1) 20648**]).
She further notes feeling very fatigued, with low-grade fevers
and sweats (no chills). Highest temp was 101 this morning
(0200). She notes decreased PO/appetite with 2 lbs weight loss
over the past few days (40 lbs since diagnosis). She notes
baseline migraine HA (normal for her, for which she takes
fioricet) unchanged, sinus pain, sore throat, pain on
swallowing, nausea, vomitting, diarrhea, constipation, melena,
BRBPR, dysuria, vaginal discharge, leg pain, back pain. She
denies recent travel or ill contacts.
In the ED she was 84/61, HR 90, RR 20, 98% on 3L NC, afebrile.
She was given 2L NS, improved to 100/50, HR 80's (not on BB).
She was thought to have ? RUL [**Last Name (LF) 103346**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] given 750mg iv
levofloxacin, 1gm iv vanco, 600mg iv clinda. Her Hem onc fellow
did not want central line and BP stabilized. She was given 25mg
iv benedryl for ? phlebitis in left arm iv (? unclear
precipitant). Lactate 1.1. Random cortisol and blood cultures x2
sent. She was transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for further management.
.
On arrival she feels much improved, ROS as above.

She was transferred to the medical floor on [**2134-7-2**].  Upon
arrival, she states she was feeling much better.  Her breathing
was easier, though she did note some dyspnea while washing up in
the morning.  She continues to have migraine symptoms, she has
some intermittent low back pain for which she's needed
breakthrough medication, but overall she is feeling much
improved.

Past Medical History:
ONCOLOGIC HISTORY: Initially presented with dyspnea on exertion
and found on CXR to have mass in the right upper lobe. CT showed
a 2.5 x 1.5 spiculated nodule in the right apex along with
emphysema and mediastinal lymphadenopathy. She underwent a
bronchoscopy, which confirmed non-small cell lung cancer. PET
scan on [**2133-10-8**] confirmed uptake in the spiculated right
upper lobe mass as well as lymphadenopathy in the right
supraclavicular node, peribronchial, mediastinal, and
contralateral mediastinal lymph nodes. Diagnosed with stage IIIB
nonsmall cell lung cancer and treated with two cycles of
cisplatinum and etoposide along with radiation complicated by
persistently low platelet count: completed [**12-2**].
Her cancer responded and she underwent RUL lobectomy [**2134-2-25**].
Pathology showed "very small amount" residual non-small cell
lung cancer as well as 0/4 lymph nodes involved. Follow-up
revealed left supraclavicular adenopathy and repeat PET scan
showed avid LAD in left supraclavicular, axillary and posterior
cervical nodes. Biopsy of her supraclavicular and axillary lymph
node on the left side revealed NSCLC. Taxotere chemotherapy was
started on [**2134-6-15**] for concern that her cancer is causing
lymphatic obstruction in her left axilla. She was admitted
[**Date range (1) 20648**] with back and neck pain, also with SOB, CTA negative,
thought to be [**1-29**] splinting from pain. Scheduled for admit for
taxotere/bronchoscopy [**7-5**].
..
COPD on home O2, Spirometry [**5-3**]: FEV1 1.18 liters (49%
predicted), FVC 2.08 liters (64% predicted), FEV1/FVC ratio
56.72 (77% predicted)
Hypothyroidism after thyroidectomy
CCY
Inguinal hernia
GERD and Barrett's esophagus
HTN
s/p knee cartildge repair
s/p hyesterectomy
ulcerative colitis, on asacol, no active symptoms

Social History:
 She lives alone in [**Location 4288**], recently moved from [**Location 3615**]
to be near her brother. She is retired from the department of
Mental Retardation and has been on disability since [**2117**] due to
mental health issues and now cancer. She smoked 2 ppd for 45+
years and quit [**10-2**] though still smokes 10 cigarettes every 2
weeks. She drinks 2 drinks/year and smoked marijuana during her
chemotherapy, not currently.

Pertinent Results:
.
Imaging:
portable CXR ([**2134-7-2**])IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared
to [**3-26**] through [**7-1**]:
Left lung is fully expanded and clear.  Postoperative right lung
is small and contains a large right suprahilar mass.  Appearance
of the lower lung suggest some atelectasis and vascular
congestion but no strong evidence for pneumonia. Heart size
normal.  Upper mediastinum shifted to the right contiguous with
apical pleural or extrapleural cap, of longstanding.

Brief Hospital Course:
58 year old woman with stage IIIb NSCLC s/p right upper
lobectomy, XRT, 2 cycles of cisplatinum and etoposide, then 1
cycle taxotere with acute worsening of dyspnea, fever and cough.
 Also with anemia, hypertension, chronic pain, hypothyroid,
migraine headaches and depression.  Following issues addressed
on this admission:
.
1. Dyspnea: Chronic dyspnea multifactorial including lung
cancer, copd and anemia.  Worsened on admit, treated for
pneumonia (initial empiric cocverage with levaquin/vancomycin
until [**7-4**] with return of sputum cx which demonstrated
oropharyngeal flora only.  Tailored to levaquin, for 10 day
course.  COPD regimen of advair, tiotropium, albuterol nebs
continued.  Dyspnea improved throughout course, at baseline on
discharge patient's oxygen saturation was inmid 90's on room
air.

2. Hypotension with history of hypertension: Likely related to
poor po as improved with 2L IVF and stable throughout although
noted history of hypertension on two agents.. No further
episodes of hypotension following IVF.  Orthostatic on [**7-4**],
given one unit of prbc's and further ivf's.  BP meds (lisinopril
and nifedipine held as of [**7-4**]).  Patient remained normotensive
for the remainder of her stay and should follow up with her PCP
regarding reinitiating antihypertensive meds.
.
3.Fever: pulmonary infection possible vs drug fever.
Defervesced on vanc/levo  as of [**7-4**]. Vanc d/ced on [**7-4**].  To
complete course of levaquin.
.
4 Anemia: Likely chemotherapy/malignancy related;hemolysis
indices negative.  Given one unit pRBC's [**7-4**].
.
5. COPD: advair, tiotropium, albuterol, antibiotics as above.
.
6 NSCLC: Was to start C2D1 of taxotere [**7-5**], hem onc aware,
deferred at this time.  She will follow up with oncology on
[**7-14**].

7. Right shoulder pain: ? hypersensitivity [**1-29**] taxotere,
improved significantly since last admit. Continued fentanyl
patch, held on lidocaine patch as currently well controlled and
can not continue this at home, continued neurontin.
.
8. back pain:  continued fentanyl, oxycodone prn for
breakthrough
.
9. GERD: coon
