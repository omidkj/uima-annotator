Admission Date:  [**2153-8-12**]              Discharge Date:   [**2153-8-29**]

Date of Birth:  [**2072-6-16**]             Sex:   M

Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Sulfa (Sulfonamides) / Bactrim

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2972**]
Chief Complaint:
Right shoulder pain, fever

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation
.
Urethral dilatation for foley placement
.
[**8-27**]: Right shoulder MRI
IMPRESSION:
1)  Tendinosis in the distal supraspinatus and infraspinatus
tendons without evidence of tearing.
2) Edema in the medial aspects of the supraspinatus and
infraspinatus muscles without associated atrophy, which is
nonspecific.
3)  Mild acromioclavicular osteoarthritis.
.
[**8-28**]: Thoracic spine MRI
IMPRESSION:  Multilevel degenerative disease with at least
moderate spinal canal narrowing as above.  No abnormal signal
within the cord.  Study is severely limited due to patient
motion artifact.  However, given the absence of abnormal T2
signal in the disc spaces or within the vertebral bodies,
osteomyelitis is considered unlikely.
.
[**8-23**] Abd US
IMPRESSION:  Unremarkable abdominal ultrasound.  No evidence of
cholecystitis, cholangitis, or focal mass lesion identified.  No
fluid collection or source of MRSA identified.
.
TEE [**8-23**]
Conclusions:
1. The left atrium is moderately dilated.
2. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Due to suboptimal
technical  quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be
fully excluded. Overall  left ventricular systolic function is
low normal (LVEF 50-55%).
3. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
4. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trace aortic
regurgitation  is seen.
5. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+)
mitral
regurgitation is seen.
6. No obvious vegetations are seen.
7. Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2153-8-13**],
LV function  may have improved.
.
Video speech and swallow ([**8-21**])
FINDINGS:  Oropharyngeal swallowing evaluation was performed
today in
collaboration with speech and swallow pathologist.  The thin
liquid, nectar thick, pureed, and [**12-27**] of cookie were
administered.  There were moderate defects with decreased bolus
control and premature spillover of thin and thick liquids to the
valleculae and piriform sinuses.  There was a decreased high
laryngeal excursion, laryngeal valve closure, and only partial
epiglottic deflection.  There was mild-to-moderate deep
penetration that occurred during the swallow with both thin and
nectar thick liquids.  However, though barium was seen on the
vocal cords, no aspiration below the vocal cords was
definitively demonstrated.

IMPRESSION:  A moderate dysphasia with deep penetration to thin
and nectar thick liquids.
.
Shoulder XRAY [**8-16**]
No fracture or dislocation is detected. No bony destructive
changes are seen. No obvious soft tissue abnormalities are
appreciated.  Minimal degenerative changes of the
acromioclavicular joints are present.
.
CTA [**8-13**]
IMPRESSION:
1.  No aortic dissection or pulmonary embolism.
2.  Coronary artery bypass graft.  Severe coronary artery
calcifications.
3.  Unchanged cardiomegaly.  Trace bilateral pleural effusions,
decreased from the prior study.
4.  Unchanged compression deformities of the thoracic spine
.
CT Head [**8-13**]
IMPRESSION:  No acute intracranial hemorrhage.  No change
compared to the prior study.


History of Present Illness:
Pt is an 81 yo priest w/ h/o CAD s/p MI, HTN, DM2, who p/w
altered mental status, R shoulder pain x 5d and fever spike to
99.9 at home. He had apparently had worsening shoulder pain for
five days, wincing when the shoulder was touched.  Pt initially
treating shoulder pain at [**Hospital3 **] w/ ASA, heat pack per
his PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) 2772**], noted to have altered MS changes by his [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **]
he was brought to [**Hospital1 18**] ED.
In [**Name (NI) **], pt noted to be febrile to 101.9, other VSS. Labs notable
for WBC 14.2, lactate 2.4. LP normal. While in the ED, he became
increasingly hypertensive, up to the 230's systolic, difficult
to control with a NTG-gtt and eventually became increasingly
hypoxic.  There was questionable seizure activity, and the
patient was intubated for acute respiratory failure.  At this
point, he underwent CTA showing no PE, dissection, or pulmonary
abnormality, as well as no soft tissue or osseous abnormalities
that could explain his shoulder pain.  He also received
ceftriaxone, metronidazole, vancomycin, and furosemide 40mg IV x
1.

Brief Hospital Course:
Pt is a 81 yo man with PMH CAD s/p MI, HTN, DM2, who p/w altered
mental status, R shoulder pain x 5d and fever.
.
#Respiratory failure -- Given overall story, normal initial CXR,
lack of presenting respiratory complaints, pre- and
post-intubation CXR's, and post-intubation CTA, it seems the
most likely diagnosis was acute pulmonary edema secondary to a
hypertensive emergency.  He has known depressed systolic
function and MR and likely could not tolerate the elevated
afterload, causing sudden fluid back-up into the pulmonary tree.
 This scenario is further supported by his rapid improvement (in
terms of o2 sats, abg, and post-intubation cxr) as the
positive-pressure ventilation likely dropped both his preload
and afterload.  There was probably a modest contribution from
his RUL pneumonia, seen on the next day's CXR as well.  Other
possibilities, such as aspiration and PE were excluded his
post-intubation CTA.  No known history of obstructive lung
disease and was moving air well on exam.
On the second day of admission, he was easily reduced to minimal
ventilatory settings and then extubated with the use of a
nitroglycerin drip to control both preload and afterload.  A
moderate diuresis was He did quite well afterwards, quickly
being weaned down from a 70% face-mask to 4L NC with good o2
saturations.  On the floor he was satting in the mid 90s on room
air and did not have any further respiratory difficulties.  He
was found to have a RUL pneumonia (likely MRSA).  Will continue
furosemide 40mg PO.  WBC stable and afebrile.

#CHF -- Pt seems to have
