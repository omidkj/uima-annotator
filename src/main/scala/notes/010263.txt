Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 443**]
Chief Complaint:
chest pain/pressure

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
cardiac cath

History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **] y/o F with PMH of CAD s/p multiple PCI, DM and [**Hospital **]
transferred from OSH with NSTEMI. Pt was in her usual state of
health until yesterday morning while eating cereal at which
point she felt a substernal pain that increased to [**9-1**]. She
describes the pain as constant, non-radiating, sharp, as if a
balloon was about to [**Doctor Last Name **] in her chest. She denies
nausea/vomiting, arm numbness/tingling, neck pain,
lightheadedness/dizziness. She denied She denies ever having
pain such as this in the past. She does endorse having
exertional chest pressure that occurs when she climbs one flight
of stairs but never at rest.
.
She was brought to [**Hospital **] Hosp ED and given morphine and
nitroglycerin gtt. Her chest pain then dissipated but then
briefly recurred on the floor when her nitroglycerin gtt was
intermittently shut off. Her first set of Cardiac enzymes was
negative but second set was positive. She was then started on
heparin gtt, aspirin 325mg and plavix 600mg.
.
On arrival to the CCU, she reports very mild chest pain [**12-3**]
that she describes more as "pressure" then pain. Her vitals were
Afebrile, HR74, BP 144/64, RR20 97% RA.
On review of systems, she denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or
red stools. She denies recent fevers, chills or rigors. She
denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other review
of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence dyspnea on
exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema,
palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

Imaging:

Echo: [**2104-2-19**]:
 The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion
abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). There is no ventricular
septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. There
are three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets are
moderately thickened. The study is inadequate to exclude
significant aortic valve stenosis (visually mild AS is
suggested). Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. There is severe mitral annular calcification. Mild
(1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing,
the severity of mitral regurgitation may be significantly
UNDERestimated.] The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could
not be determined. There is no pericardial effusion.

CXR [**2104-2-18**]: No acute intrathoracic process (OSH report)

Cath [**2104-2-19**]:
COMMENTS:
1. Selective coronary angiography in this right dominant system
demonstrtaes non-hemodynamically significant atherosclerotic
disease on
all three coronary arteries. The left anterior descending
contains
diffuse disease and a 50% lesion in the mid vessel. The
previously
placed stent is patent. The cirucmflext artery contains serial
30-40%
plaques. The stent is widely patent. The right coronary artery
ocntains
diffuse disease to 40%, with a 50% stenosis proximally.
2. The right subclavian artery contains a 360 degree turn that
made
selective coronary intubatoin impossible via a radial approach.
3. Limited resting hemodynamics demonstrtae normal systemic
blood
pressure.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Tortuous right subclavian artery.


Brief Hospital Course:
[**Age over 90 **] y/oF with PMH of CAD s/p multiple PCI p/w NSTEMI.
.
# Chest pain: given her hx of prior PCI, stable angina and
uptrending CE, coronary ischemia/ NSTEMI was thought to be the
likely cause of her chest pain/pressure. This is further
supported by nitroglycerin gtt relieving her symptoms. EKG was
stable without any significant ST changes. She had a high TIMI
score and was thought to benefit from early intervention. Her
nitro gtt was weaned and stopped over the first night. She
underwent a TTE in the am that showed EF55% with mild AS and
mild Mitral regurg and a cath that reveal stable disease that
could not be intervened on. She was managed medically with ASA
325, heparin gtt, plavix 75mg, metoprolol 12.5 mg TID and
atorvastatin 80mg daily. She did well overnight and was
transferred to the general cardiology floor.  She was seen by
physical therapy and she will go home with home VNA services and
cardiac Rehab as well as the medications listed above.
.
# DM: chronic issue, found to have a A1c of 8.7. We continued
her OSH insulin regimen (aspart SS with glargine 10U at night).
Her sugars continued to be high and we increased her sliding
scale.  She was on glyburide 5mg PO BID at home, but given her
persistently high FSG we started her on glargine 10 units at
night in addition to her glyburide 5mg PO BID.  She will follow
up in the outpatient setting for further management of her
diabetes.
.
# HTN : 144/64 on admission, we continued home lisinopril,
amlodipine and changed atenolol
