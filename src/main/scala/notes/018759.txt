History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 74621**] is a 27 year old man with [**Known lastname 60478**], s/p VP shunt,
seizure d/o,
who presents 5 days after a shunt revision with status
epilepticus.

Per family, pt. had been in his USOH until 1 week PTA (last
monday).  On monday they felt that he was lethargic and not as
interactive as he normally is.  He had frequent seizures that
day, which his parents describe as brief episodes (1-2 minutes)
where his body would twist to the right and would become rigid,
and his eyes would "bulge out."  The seizures were happening 7-8
times an hour in the 4 hours that his parents observed him that
afternoon.  In between he was lethargic and never got back to
his
normal self.  They felt that his pupils were assymetric and that
the right was larger and less reactive than the left.  They
therefore brought him to [**Location (un) **] ED.  There he did not have any
witnessed seizure activity per his parents.  He had a Head CT,
which the parents were told was unchanged from his last CT there
several months prior.  He was diagnosed with a UTI and sent
home.
His parents were called the next day by the infirmary at the
group home and told that he had no further seizures and that he
was "resting comfortably" and had eaten some food.  The day
after
that they were called and told that although he still had no
further seizures, he still was quite lethargic and was not
waking
up.  They visited him and felt that he was diaphoretic,
unresponsive to his name, and not at all himself (though they
agree that they did not see any further seizures)  They insisted
that he be brought to [**Hospital1 336**], where he had last had his shunt
revised a year earlier.  There a Head CT was performed that
showed hydrocephalus, and he was emergently taken to the OR for
shunt revision.  He was monitored for 2 days after that, and
discharged home on Friday.  His parents reports that on saturday
his face was somewhat swollen on the left, and his eye was
almost
swollen shut.  He was awake and more back to himself in terms of
his mental status.  They brought him back to [**Hospital1 336**], where they
were told that it was normal post-op edema, and he was
discharged
back home.

Today, they were called because he had a protracted GTC.  His
father describes the seizures he saw at the OSH (he was not
present at the group home when the seizures started)  He
describes that his head was deviated R, and his eyes were
deviated up and to the right.  He became rigid, grunted loudly,
and then started shaking his arms and legs violently.  EMS and
OSH ED records indicate that he was seizing for about 25
minutes.
He received valium 15 mg PR x 2 in the field, and in the ED
received Valium 5 mg IV, at which point the seizures stopped.
He
was intubated for airway protection at 14:00, and started on a
Propofol drip at 14:45.  He received Dilantin 1 g IV load.  He
received Ativan 2 mg IV at 17:10 prior to transport (no seizure
activity noted at that point in the records)  OSH labs at 12:30
were significant for a depakote level of 46, tegretol level of
0.7, normal LFTs, WBC Ct of 12.2, and noraml Chem 7.  UA showed
30 protein, 250 glucose, negative ketones, LE, and nitrites, and
0-2 WBCs, lg blood, and mod bacteria.

Imaging
Non-Contrast Head CT:
1. No evidence of intracranial hemorrhage or hydrocephalus.
2. Chronic encephalomalacic changes most notable of the right
cerebral hemisphere.
3. Small chronic subdural hematomas vs. cystic hygromas.
4. VP shunt catheter terminates in the frontal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the right
lateral ventricle. No hydrocephalus identified, although prior
studies are not available for comparison.
<br>

CXR:
1. ET tube tip terminates just above the level of thoracic
inlet.
2. Pulmonary opacity at the right lung base which may represent
aspiration and/or pneumonia.
<br>

EEG: This is an abnormal portable EEG due to the presence of
multifocal sharp and slow wave discharges in a generalized,
bifrontal, left hemispheric or right frontocentral distribution.
Findings are suggestive of ongoing regions of cortical
irritability with potential for epileptogenesis. No video
accompanied this study, so it is unclear it a change in state is
evident during times of discharges. In addition, multifocal slow
transient discharges were noted; this abnormality may be seen in
the context of a diffuse process involving the cortex but can
also be seen in the context of a mild encephalopathy of toxic,
metabolic, infectitious or anoxic etiology. Finally, persistent
mixed frequency slowing was noted in the right parasagittal
region, suggestive of cortical and subcortical dysfunction in
that region.

Video Swallow: Mild oral dysphagia. No penetration or
aspiration. Mild premature spillover with liquids.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 74621**] is a 27-year-old man with a history of mental
retardation, cerebral palsy, a seizure disorder, and
hydrocephalus s/p VP shunt placement with a VP shunt revision 5
days ago who presented to an outside hospital in status
epilepticus (25 minutes of seizure activity documented); he was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further care. His hospital course by
problem is as follows:

1. Neuro: He was initially admitted to the Neuro ICU after
receiving valium, being loaded with phenytoin, and being
intubated at [**Hospital6 8972**]. CSF showed elevated
protein and mildly elevated WBC (14), and he was febrile to
104F. He was started on vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and ampicillin
for empiric meningitis coverage. However, it was later
determined that the protein elevation reflected trapped CSF in
the VP shunt and was not due to infection. Neurosurgery was
consulted to evaluate the VP shunt function, which was fine. His
CSF culture and gram stain were negative. Given his high fever,
the trigger was presumed to be infectious.

His Tegretol dose was increased from 400 [**Hospital1 **] to 400 tid. He was
continued on Depakote. Efforts were made to clarify his Lamictal
