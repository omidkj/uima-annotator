Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2485**]
Chief Complaint:
Dizziness and falls, shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
HPI: Pt is a 80f with interstitial lung disease, MALT lymphoma,
bilat breast ca s/p bilat mastectomies, cryptococall and
aspergillus pna's in [**2119**] and aspergillus in [**2123**], recent MRSA
pna currently on 6wk course of linezolid, recent sinusitis s/p 2
weeks levoflox (finished 1 wk ago), recent C. diff (finished
metronidazole 2-3days ago), hypoth presents with a 2 days of
diarrhea, decreased po intake, dizziness, weakness, and falls.
She says that the falls may have been related to fainting, but
she's not sure; she is unclear on much of the history, and per
prior notes, this appears to be her baseline.  She denies f/c,
ha, chest pain, abd pain, n/v, dysuria/hematuria, change in
urine vol.  She denies any pain in chest/back/abdomen or joints,
no pain from the fall, does not think she hit her head.

Pertinent Results:
CXR: Persistent infiltrate, possible incr left mid lung zone, no
major change
.
CT Chest: Unchanged
.
CT head: No hemorrhage, sinusitis unchanged (complete paranasal
opacities)
.
ECG: Sinus tach, nl axis, nl intervals, lvh, no q/st-t
changes/twi
.
Labs: hct 27.7 (baseline 26-29)
.
[**1-16**] CT head:
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage.
2. Opacification of multiple sinuses, similar in appearance to
previous examination, with interval opacification of right
mastoid air cells.
3. MRI with DWI may be performed to exclude subtle abnormalities
as clinically warranted.
.
CT chest and abdomen:
IMPRESSION:
1. Right lower lobe consolidation, left lower lobe
consolidation, scattered bilateral ground-glass and nodular
opacities appear slightly worse in the interim. New right lower
lobe lateral aspect consolidation.
2. Increased pulmonary interstitial edema. Increased small
bilateral pleural effusions.
3. No evidence of retroperitoneal hematoma.
4. Anasarca.
5. Calcified lymphadenopathy in the chest, unchanged. Contrast
enhancement within the urinary collecting system and gallbladder
probably due to previous cardiac catheterization and poor renal
function.

Brief Hospital Course:
   This 80 yo female with a h/o interstitial lung disease
(?miliary pattern), MALT lymphoma, bilat breast ca s/p bilat
mastectomies, cryptococcal and aspergillus pna's in [**2119**] and
aspergillus in [**2123**], recent MRSA pna currently on 6wk course of
linezolid (started [**12-6**]), recent sinusitis s/p 2 weeks levoflox
(finished 1 wk prior to admission)), recent C. diff (finished
metronidazole 5-6 days ago), who initially presented with a 2
days of diarrhea, decreased po intake, dizziness, weakness, and
falls.  On the floor, she was initially treated with Flagyl for
possible C. diff (this was stopped on [**1-10**] with 1 neg C. diff
and the recommendation of ID.  It was thought that her delta MS
may have been due to underlying infection, and source for this
was sought out.  Given her h/o sinusitis, ENT was consulted; as
she had no clinical symptoms of sinusitis, decision was made to
treat with NS nasal spray.  Pulmonary, ID, and thoracics were
consulted to evaluate her chronic lung process that appeared
unchanged on CT from this admission (pt still with RLL
consolidation with cavitary component, unchanged from prior
study despite 4 weeks of linezolid).  Cultures have remained
negative, and pt has had only low-grade fevers.
Interdisciplinary family meeting on [**1-10**] was held, and it was
decided to proceed with CT-guided core biopsy when possible to
biopsy lung process and lymph nodes.  Heme/onc was also
consulted with respect to hypogammoglobulinemia and recommended
IVIG (which she received on [**1-7**]).
   She was transferred to the MICU on [**2124-1-10**], she became
tachypneic on the floor approximately 1 hour s/p PRBC
transfusion, with RR to 40's, with ABG of 7.17/76/217 (?baseline
CO2).  She received 1 mg morphine initially CXR was difficult to
interpret given bilateral breast reconstructions but appeared
grossly unchanged..  She was placed on non-invasive ventilation
(CPAP/BiPAP), and ABG improved to 7.23/60/219.  She received 20
mg IV lasix with only a small amount of concentrated  urine
output .  She became tachycardic (to 120s) and hypotensive (SBPs
in 70s from baseline of 150) in this setting.  Upon arrival to
ICU, she was bolused with 250 cc NS with improvement in these
parameters.  She had no specific complaints and stated her
breathing felt better.  She was admitted to ICU for further
observation overnight and non-invasive ventilation as needed.
   Her hypercarbic respiratory failure seemed to correlate
temporarily with blood transfusion (1hr s/p).  X-ray did not
seem grossly volume overloaded, however, but BNP was elevated.
Her initial ABG was consistent with hypercarbia; this improved
with non-invasive ventilation and O2 sats have been stable.  She
was continued on non-invasive ventialation as needed and wean
FiO2.
.
2.  Hypotension: on floor, in setting of lasix, positive
pressure ventilation, responded to IVF while maintaining O2
Sats.  Hypovolemia is most likely etiology
   - bolus as necessary for bp; follow UO, goal even to 500 cc
positive
   - will reck TTE in am; EKG without ischemic signs, no reason
to suspect cardiogenic shock
.
3.  ?PNA/ILD: unclear what lung process represents; has had MRSA
in sputum that may be pathogen. Currently completing 6 week
course of linezolid and ID following closely
    - send bld cx, Ucx, C. diff, sputum
    - plan is for CT-guided biopsy--?lymphoma, bronchoalveolar
carcinoma, infection, fungal, ILD on differential for lung
process; touch base with thoracics and radiology (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4401**]
in am
    - Continue Linezolid for now
    - low threshold to broaden abx coverage if decompensates
    - f/u ID recs
    - leukocytosis may be stress response although is concerning
for infection; will follow
    - no empiric C. diff treatment for now
    - no rx for ?sinusitis at this time, d/w ID
.
4.  Hypogammoglobulinemia: s/p IVIG on [**1-7**], f/u onc recs;
would this affect ability to mount fever/response to ?infection.
.
5.  CHF: signs of dCHF on TTE from [**11-27**]; BNP elevated but seems
intravascularly depleted, BP responed to IVF
     - follow I/Os an
