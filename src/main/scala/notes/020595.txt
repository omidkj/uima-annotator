cta [**2-2**]: IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of PE.
2. Multifocal consolidative opacities as described with
predominance in the posterior lower lobes bilaterally,
concerning for pneumonia.
3. Right hilar and mediastinal lymphadenopathy.
4. Soft tissue opacity adjacent the lung Ca resection site, and
multifocal opacities along bronchovascular bundles raise the
suspicion for lung Ca recurrence. Comparison to old studies
would be very helpful (none are available at [**Hospital1 18**] on PACS). If
such studies are unavailable, then a PET-CT may be warranted for
further investigation.
5. Collapsed medial segment of the right middle lobe. Bronchial
obstruction by recurrent lung Ca is of concern.
6. Hypoattenuating lesion in the caudate lobe of the liver,
incompletely characterized on this single contrast study.
7. Moderate-severe emphysema.


Brief Hospital Course:
In brief, the patient is a 71 yo M w/ EtOH, COPD, NSCLC s/p RUL
Lobectomy with dyspnea likely [**2-7**] aspiration pneumonia and COPD
flare, c/b by MS change reaction to ambien.
.
1. Dyspnea: This was thought likely secondary to aspiration
pneumonia and COPD flare.  His breathing improved with
aggressive bronchodilator therapy, corticosteroids and
antibiotics.  He will complete a 14 day course of antibiotics.
He was discharged with stable oxygenation with supplemental O2
that will be made available at home. He was referred to
outpatient pulmonary rehab.
.
2. H/o NSCLC s/p RUL lobectomy: A chest CT scan during admission
demonstrated new nodules at previous scar site also with large
mediastinal LN. A pulmonary consult was obtained and discussed
his case in Thoracic Tumor Board regarding the possible relapse
of his lung cancer.  The location of the mediastinal lymph node
was thought most amenable to endoscopic ultrasound guided biopsy
via an esophageal approach.  He was referred to the ERCP group
for biopsy following resolution of his acute illness.
.
3. Mental Changes: The patient had acute MS change on night
after admission following a dose of Ambien which was thought the
likely inciting [**Doctor Last Name 360**].  As the patient has a history of alcohol
abuse there was concern for alcohol withdrawal however his rapid
recovery without specific intervention made this unlikely.
Otherwise his vital signs, chemistries and blood gas were
essentially unchanged from his baseline.
.
4. Hypertension: The patient's baseline hypertension was mildly
exacerbated by steroids, anticipate improvement as steroids
taper. He continued on his home beta-blocker and ACEi.
.
5. EtOH abuse: Pt. has extensive history of abuse, no current
signs of withdrawal. As above, MS [**First Name (Titles) 4245**] [**Last Name (Titles) 4246**]. patient
states that he just quit drinking (as of this admission). He was
monitored per CIWA protocol without incident.
.
6. Blood cx from OSH: Prior to transfer to [**Hospital1 18**], blood cultures
were drawn these resulted as 1/4 bottles w/ coag neg staph. This
was thought likely skin contaminate. Repeat BCx were negative.
.
7. Hyperlipidemia: There were no acute issues. Continue statin.

.
8. PPX: PPI
.
9. FEN: Cardiac diet, moniter and replete lytes PRN. insulin
sliding scale for glucose control while in the hospital. As the
steroids are tapered his blood sugars should normalize.
