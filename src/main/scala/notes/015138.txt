Brief Hospital Course:
Patient evaluated in emergency department by surgical team and
admitted to ACS service.  CTA chest done revealed recurrent left
pleural effusion, now loculated, after splenic rupture.  He also
had an increased temp and WBC.  He was admitted to surgery for
splenectomy and thoracic surgery was consulted for chest tube
placement.  On [**8-28**] he underwent left-sided chest tube
placement, exploratory laparotomy, splenectomy, abscess washout.
He tolerated the procedure well and remained intubated
overnight.  His vent was weaned and he was extubated on [**8-29**]
without event.  He was transferred to the floor.

He had significant pain control issues requiring high dose of
intravenous narcotics. Once his chest tube was removed his pain
seemed to diminish; an abdominal binder was also used which
seemed to contribute significantly to his comfort. He is being
discharged on oral pain regimen and bowel medications.

He was closely followed by Physical therapy and initially
recommended for rehab but given that he progressed rapidly once
his pain was better controlled he was recommended for home with
services.

By the time of discharge he was tolerating a regular diet and
ambulating with a cane.
he will follow up in ACS and Thoracic clinic as an outpatient.
He will also require follow up with his primary providers.
