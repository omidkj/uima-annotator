Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 689**]
Chief Complaint:
[**First Name3 (LF) **]

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intensive Care, Mechanical Ventilation


History of Present Illness:
57 y.o. male with history of MS [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] who presented
to [**Hospital1 **] with complaints of fatigue, "low vision" and
nausea, and decreased function of his hands, b/l hip pain,
constipation x 1 week.

While being worked up was found to have a low-grade fever (per
wife- baseline temp is 94-95F) and UTI for which he received
Ceftriaxone and Vancomcyin and was also hyponatremic to 120.

He was given NS and shortly thereafter had two seizures and bit
his tongue during one of them with bleeding and was thus
intubated for airway protection in addition to receiving a total
of 3 mg IV Ativan.

He was then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for neurological evaluation. Of
note, patient does not have a history of seizure disorder and is
not on seizure medications. He has had one seizure in the past,
in the setting of an infection. After arriving to [**Hospital1 18**], he was
evaluated by neurology who felt that the patient's seizure was
likely multifactorial in etiology with infection and
[**Hospital1 **] being the likely contributors. Meningitis was on
the differential, though not felt to be very likely and given
his clinical instability, an LP was deferred and Ceftriaxone and
Vancomycin were continued. Head CT was also unremarkable. He was
then admitted to the MICU for further management.

ROS: No HA. No menigismus. Inc confusion, clumsiness, low vision
(typical of infection per wife). Erythema around suprapubic cath
site, but no exudate.


Past Medical History:
MS - since [**2119**], progressive, quadriplegic, neurogenic bladder
with suprapubic catheter, restrictive [**Year (4 digits) 1570**]'s
History of Aspiration PNAs
Esophageal Ulcer - [**12-23**] NSAIDs, [**2139**], small bowel bx negative
Recurrent UTIs
CHF (EF > 65% with moderate LVH in '[**39**])
HTN
Legally Blind


Social History:
He is married 32 years and lives with his wife at home.  He has
three children and three grandchildren. He was a professor [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 25931**] engineering at [**University/College 25932**], but
retired on disability after the [**2128**] spring semester due to his
MS. [**Name13 (STitle) **] is wheelchair-bound.  He denies tobacco, alcohol, and
recreational drug use.  Has personal care assistant.



Family History:
Father had CAD and CVA. Mother has [**Name (NI) 2481**] disease. Brother
has diabetes.

Physical Exam:
Vitals: T 99.9, HR 71, BP 118/66, R 16, 98% intubated
Gen- obese, critically ill, bleeding from the mouth, intubated
and sedated.
HEENT: NCAT, R corneal hyphema at 3 0'clock, anicteric sclera,
blood from mouth, + tongue trauma.
NECK: no carotid bruits bilaterally, no nuchal rigidity.
CV: distant sounds, RRR, accentuated split S2, no MRG
PULM: CTA B
Abd: obese, RLQ with baclofen pump, + BS, ND
Extrem: generalized edema with 1+ pitting LE edema bilaterally
to
above the knee. 1+ dp pulses bilaterally.

NEUROLOGIC EXAM:
MS- occasionally chewing on ET tube. pt does not open eyes to
voice. he does not follow commands. he does not localize noxious
stimuli.

CN- PERRL 5-->3 sluggish, corneal reflex intact bilaterally,
when
eyelids are opened he has conjugate roving eye movements, he
does
not regard the examiner, oculocephalic reflex intact, brisk gag
reflex.

Motor- withdraws left arm purposefully to nailbed pressure, no
withdrawal to pain on left, nail bed pressure on right foot
induces clonus but no withdrawal, left foot nailbed pressure
results in slight withdrawal.

left toe muted, right babinski reflex induces clonus.

Sensory- as above in motor exam. withdraws R arm, grimace on L
arm, RLE clonus, LLE grimace.

Reflexes- clonus at R ankle, absent patellar reflexes, 2+
symmetric brachioradialis, unable to elicit bicep or triceps
reflexes.


Pertinent Results:
EKG: Normal sinus at approximately 80, nl axis, nl PR, narrow
QRS, < 1 mm STD in II and TWI in III.

CT Head ([**3-6**]):
There is no intracranial mass lesion, hydrocephalus, shift of
normally midline structures, major vascular territorial infarct,
or intracranial hemorrhage. The [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter
differentiation is preserved. The osseous structures are
unremarkable. The visualized paranasal sinuses demonstrate
opacification of the ethmoid sinus.
IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial pathology.

CXR ([**3-6**]): Limited study due to low lung volumes. Endotracheal
tube
terminates approximately 5 cm above the carina. Retrocardiac
opacity may represent the combination of atelectasis and pleural
effusion, cannot rule out consolidation. Followup is
recommended.

EEG
ABNORMALITY #1: Throughout the recording, there is an
interhemispheric
asymmetry with more complex rhythms, at times with faster
frequencies,
noted on the left compared with a slightly lower voltage and
slower
frequency activity over the right side.

ABNORMALITY #2: The background was of low voltage, disorganized,
and
slow typically in the [**4-28**] Hz frequency range, admixed with
bursts of
generalized mixed frequency theta and delta frequency slowing.

BACKGROUND: As above.
HYPERVENTILATION: Could not be performed as this was a portable
study.
INTERMITTENT PHOTIC STIMULATION: Could not be performed as this
was a
portable study.
SLEEP: No normal waking or sleeping morphologies were noted.
CARDIAC MONITOR: Showed a generally regular rhythm with an
average rate
of 78 bpm.

IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal portable EEG due to the
interhemispheric asymmetry with somewhat more complex and faster

frequency rhythms noted broadly over the left side compared with
lower
voltage and slower frequency rhythms noted over the right. The
findings
suggest bilateral subcortical dysfunction which is more
prominent over
the right side. In addition, the background was disorganized,
low
voltage and slow with admixed bursts of generalized mixed
frequency
slowing with this constellation of findings being consistent
with a
diffuse moderately severe encephalopathy. Medications, metabolic

disturbances, and infection are among the common causes of
encephalopathy but there are others. There were no epileptiform
features and no electrographic seizure activity was noted.

ECHO:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is moderate symmetric
left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is
small. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF 70%). There is no ventricular septal defect. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve appears
structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is
no mitral valve prolapse. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure
could not be determined. There is no pericardial effusion.

Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed)
of [**2140-10-3**], the findings are similar.

VIDEO SWALLOW
OROPHARYNGEAL VIDEO FLUOROSCOPIC SWALLOWING EVALUATION:

An oral and pharyngeal swallow evaluation was performed in
conjunction with speech and pathology department. Under
continuous videofluoroscopy, barium of various consistencies was
administered orally to the patient.

ORAL PHASE: Mastication of solids was slow. There was reduction
in AP tongue movement secondary to weakness. Bolus control was
mildly reduced with premature spillover into the pharynx. A mild
coating of the oral cavity residue remained after the swallow.
This was cleared with repeat swallows.

PHARYNGEAL PHASE: There was mild delay in swallowing initiation.
Epiglottic deflection was incomplete, although NG tube presence
may have been partially responsible. Pharyngeal transit time was
normal, but pharyngeal constriction appeared mildly reduced. A
mild coatin
