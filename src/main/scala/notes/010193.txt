Atrial ablation

History of Present Illness:
74 y/oM with PMH of CAD s/p CABG (5 vessel bypass) in [**2100**], COPD
present to ED with new onset afib prior to initiating stress
test.  Pt said that for the past month he has noticed increasing
shortness of breath both at rest and exertion and his exercise
tolerance was greatly diminished.  He can hardly walk 1 block
when he used to be able to walk.   He also noticed some
worsening lower extremity edema that comes and goes over the
past 2-3 weeks.  Otherwise the patient denies palpitations, CP,
Lightheadedness, dizziness, syncope, orthopnea, PND.  Pt was
sent to the ED for further evaluation.
.
In the ED VS were 98.5 132 130/89 16 98%RA.  Given lopressor 5 x
3 with minimal response and then 15 IV dilt HR dropped to 70s
with afib/ flutter with BP in 60s.  Pt was given 2L IVF and then
started dopamine 5-> 10 -> 6.  Pressures stablized with
systolics in the 100's.  His respiratory status remained stable.
 He was given 1 amp calcium gluconate.  Troponin was negative.
Repeat CXR was difficult to interpret as to change in position.
At the time of transfer HR was in the 120s and on 100%NRB with
BP to 81/60 (dopamine of 4)
.
On review of systems, he denies any prior history of TIA, deep
venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, myalgias, joint pains,
cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools. He denies recent
fevers, chills or rigors. He denies exertional buttock or calf
pain. All of the other review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema,
palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

IMAGING:

Brief Hospital Course:
74 y/oM with PMH of CAD s/p CABG (5 vessel bypass) in [**2100**], COPD
present to ED with new onset afib prior to initiating stress
test who became hypotensive in the setting of multiple IV nodal
agents.
.
# a-flutter: Pt was found to be in a-flutter when he arrived for
ETT in the outpatient setting.  Overnight her was ruled out and
troponins were less than 0.01 x2.  He was given lasix 20mg PO on
Day 1 and nodal agents were held because he would likely require
high doses that may compromise his BP.  A heparin drip was
started.  TTE and TEE were done and he was monitored on
telemetry.  {atient was cardioverted successfully on day 2 and
then had atrial flutter ablation on Hospital day 4.  He
tolerated the procedure well and post cath check showed no
complications.  He was doing well and was discahrged on Day 5 of
admission with follow up.
.
# Hypotension:  Occured in the setting of multiple IV nodal
agents.  He was initially placed on a dopamine drip in the ED,
but was quickly weaned off of the drip once he came to the CCU.
His BP meds were initially held and his BP remained stable.  His
lisinopril was restarted while in the CCU and then his
metoprolol was restarted on the day of discharge.  He had no
other episodes of hypotension.
.
# New oxygen requirement:  Pt was placed on NRB after
administration of 2L IVF, but no documented hypoxic period.  He
was placed on 6L NC once he arrived to the CCU and was satting
95%.  He was diuresed lasix 20mg PO on day 1.  Overnight his
oxygen requirement decreased and on Day 2 he was satting 98% on
Nasal cannula 3L. He continued to be diuresed and was on room
air by the end of hospital day 3.  He continued to be slightly
short of breath, but that should improve as his heart regains
strength.  He was discharged with no oxygen requirement.
.
# CAD: Patient has a history of CAD s/p CABG in [**2100**] and has
been doing well with no recurrence of symptoms.  He was last
seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in [**2110-11-27**].  His BB and ACE-I were
initially held in the setting of hypotension, but as his BP
stabilized they were added back one at a time.  He was continued
on his ASA 325mg PO daily during the course of his hospital
stay.
.
# HLD: Pt last lipid panel in [**2109**] showed Tchol 175, HDL 73, LDL
62.  Pt is doing well, but will lower simvastatin given
increased risk of statin induced myopathy at 80mg as well as
increased risk of rhabdomyolysis while on both a statin and
fibrate.
We Held fenofibrate - 145 mg tab daily as not part of the
formulary.  Decreased simvastatin - 40mg PO Daily given
increased risk of myopathy on 80mg PO Daily.  he will be
discharged on simvastatin 40mg PO daily.
