History of Present Illness:
This is a pleasant 62 year old female who was recently diagnosed
with critical aortic stenosis back in [**2161-1-15**] after being
hospitalized initially for shortness of breath and cough.
Cardiac catheterization at that time confirmed aortic stenosis
with a valve area of 0.6cm2 with a peak gradient of 73 mmHg.
Coronary angiography showed a right dominant system and clean
coronary arteries. Since that time, she has experienced multiple
syncopal episodes. She also has required hospitalization earlier
this month for congestive heart failure. Her most recent echo is
from [**2161-3-23**] which revealed severe aortic stenosis with peak and
mean gradients of 113 and 78 mmHg respectively. There was no
aortic insufficiency and only 1+ mitral regurgitation. Her LVEF
was normal, greater than 55%. She now presents for cardiac
surgical intervention.

[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 4125**]ospital Course:
On the day of admission, Mrs. [**Known lastname 106519**] underwent an aortic valve
replacement with a [**Street Address(2) 66683**]. [**Male First Name (un) 923**] mechanical prosthesis.
The operation was uneventful and she transferred to the CSRU in
stable condition. For further operative details, please see
seperate dictated operative note. Within 24 hours, she awoke
neurologically intact and was extubated. She maintained stable
hemodynamics but was noted to have decreased urine output in the
setting of a rising creatinine. Natrecor was initiated with a
good response. Her creatinine peaked to 2.0. As her renal
function, Natrecor was discontinued and she was transitioned to
intravenous Lasix. Her CSRU course was otherwise uneventful and
she transferred to the SDU on postoperative day three. She
tolerated beta blockade and remained in a normal sinus rhythm.
Her INR was monitored daily and Warfarin was dosed for a goal
INR between 2.0 - 3.0. She temporarily required Heparin for a
subtherapeutic prothrombin time. Over several days, she
continued to make clinical improvements and her renal function
returned to baseline. She was cleared for discharge on
postoperative day seven. At time of discharge, her BP was 113/57
with a HR of 82. Her chest x-ray showed small bilateral pleural
effusions and her oxygen saturations were 97% on room air. All
surgical wounds were clean, dry and intact. She will follow-up
with Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) **], her cardiologist and her primary care
physician as an outpatient.
