History of Present Illness:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 100616**] is a 79 year old female with a history of
hypertension, coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure,
COPD and lung cancer who was admitted to [**Hospital3 7569**] on
[**2109-2-23**] with worsening diarrhea.  The patient has been in and out
of the hospital for most of the winter with recurrent pneumonia.
 Her most recent infection was approximately three weeks ago.
She was discharged to rehab and ultimately home.  Three days
after returning home she began to experience diarrhea, up to [**3-26**]
bowel movements per day.  She presented to [**Hospital3 7569**] on
[**2109-2-23**] for her diarrhea.  On admission she was found to have a
WBC count of 40,000 with a diffusely tender abdomen.  She was
found to be c. diff positive.  She was initially started on IV
flagyl for c. diff as well as levofloxacin and prednisone out of
concern for a COPD flare.  Her antibiotics were switched to PO
flagyl and PO vancomycin on [**2109-2-25**] out of concern that she was
not improving.  On this regimen she reports that the frequency
of her diarrhea did decrease to [**11-21**] bowel movements per day.
Her white blood cell count decreased from 42k on admission to
15.7 on [**2109-3-5**].  There was concern, however, that she was
developing abdominal distention.  She underwent an abdominal CT
scan on [**2109-3-4**] which showed significant ascites throughout the
abdomen, mucosal enhancement throughout the colon with probable
diffuse wall thickening and thickening of the terminal ileum
without evidence of obstruction.  Given concern for the ascites,
the primary team at [**Location (un) **] wanted to pursue paracentesis.  Her
INR has fluctuated throughout her hospitalization at [**Location (un) **] and
on [**2109-3-4**] was 7.0.  She received vitamin K 10 mg PO x 1.  Her
family requested that she be transferred to [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 86**] hospital
for further care.

On review of systems she denies fevers, chills, chest pain,
shortness of breath, palpitations, PND, orthopnea.  She does
endorse lightheadedness and feeling dehydrated.  She endorses
right sided abdominal pain, [**11-21**] bowel movements per day.  She
continues to pass flatus. Her abdomen has become increasingly
distended over the past week.  She denies dysuria or hematuria.
She endorses chronic leg swelling which she reports has not
worsened significantly over the past week.

Imaging:
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2109-3-5**] 9:05 PM
The patient has had median sternotomy and coronary bypass
grafting. Transvenous right atrial and right ventricular pacer
wires extend continuously from the left axillary pacemaker,
terminating alongside remnant leads originating in the right
axilla. No pneumothorax present. Pleural effusion, if any, is
minimal. Lungs grossly clear. Heart size top normal.

PORTABLE ABDOMEN  [**2109-3-5**] 9:05 PM
There is apparent centralization of the bowel loops suggesting
the presence of ascites. No evidence of free intraperitoneal air
is visualized. No concerning bowel gas pattern is noted. The
small bowel and large bowel loops are unremarkable. The
visualized portion of the lung bases demonstrates small
bilateral effusion. Mild degenerative changes of the lumbar
spine is noted. Severe degenerative changes of both hip joints
are also identified.

Echocardiogram [**2109-3-6**]:
The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. There is
mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with basal
infero-lateral hypokinesis. There is no ventricular septal
defect. The right ventricular cavity is dilated The aortic root
is mildly dilated at the sinus level. The ascending aorta is
mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately
thickened. There is a minimally increased gradient consistent
with minimal aortic valve stenosis. Mild (1+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is mild pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

ABDOMEN U.S. (COMPLETE STUDY) PORT  [**2109-3-7**] 9:18 AM
The liver is markedly heterogeneous in echotexture with nodular
contour, likely representing cirrhosis or fibrosis. T
