Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 898**]
Chief Complaint:
Unresponsive, ?resp distress

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
endotracheal intubation

History of Present Illness:
85M from nursing home now being admitted to MICU for resp
distress and mental status changes. Per the daughter the pt was
being treated with abx for a cellulutis. After the abx were
stopped, the pt developed a progressive cough with fevers as
well. On the day of admission, the pt was noted by the visiting
nurse to be very SOB and coughing and an ambulance was called.
   Upon arrival to [**Hospital1 18**], noted to febrile to 100.4,
hemodymically stable but hyoxic to 84% on NRB. Given concerns
about mental status, hypoxia, pt was intubated urgently. A CXR
did suggest a RLL infiltrate. There were frothy secretions from
ETT. Labs were notable for leukocytosis to 11.4 and creatinine
of 1.7 and sodium of 148. CK's were flat but troponin's did rise
to 0.38. Lactate was 3.6 upon arrival and then later down to
2.8. Pt received Levaquin and Zosyn, cultures were taken. There
was concern that the pt was minimally responsive with eyes
deviated to the R. Head CT performed which demonstrated evidence
of chronic microvascular dz but no acute bleed. Ultimately, LP
performed showing only 1WBC and 1RBC and normal protein and
glucose.
   During ED course, remained hemodymically stable although did
spike to 101.8 during [**3-3**] afternoon. Noted to have frothy
yellow secretions. In total received 7L NS and has been
documented to have 190cc urine output.

CXR [**3-4**]: Patchy opacitis consistent with a multifocal pneumonia
are again seen in the right mid and lower lung zones.  New left
retrocardiac opacity, which may be due to atelactasis induced by
mucus plugging, or may reflect an acute aspiration event. There
is a probable small left pleural effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 3271**] is an 85 yo man with h/o Parkinson's and
hypertension who presented in respiratory distress and was found
to have a RLL pneumonia on CXR.  He was intubated urgently in
the ER in the setting of hypoxia with O2 sat 84% on NRB.  He was
also noted to have a change in mental status at that time, being
minimally responsive, whereas per his daughter his baseline is
quite good.  CSF culture and initial studies were negative.
Sputum cultures have been thus far unrevealing.

He was started on vancomycin and zosyn to cover for possible
neursing home acquired organisms, however on further questioning
it was discovered that the patient actually has assistants who
come into his home. Sputum culture was repeated on [**3-7**] and
showed pan-sensitve serraita and the patient was switched to PO
levofloxacin to complete a 14 day course. The patient was kept
on a ventilator for 6 days total, remaining on pressure support
at 10/5 for 3 days.

During his [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] course, the patient had an episode of HTN
urgency on the evening of [**3-4**] with bp 190/120s.  He was on and
off a nitro drip as well as a nicardipine drip for 24 hours.  He
was then maintained on a CCB and ACE. We avoided beta blockade
in the setting of the patient's baseline bradycardia as well as
an EKG which was possibly consistent with some form of
intermittent AV block.

Discussion with the patient's daughter revealed that he had been
intubated 3 years ago and in detailed discussion since then he
had expressed to her his desire not to be intubated or
resuscitated.  She stated that had she known there was paperwork
to be filled out to that effect she would have done so as she is
certain these were his wishes. As the patient became more alert
in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] he was able to again communicate these wishes to his
daughter.  [**Name (NI) **] was extubated and although he still had a large
amount of secretions he did well status post extubations. He
remained in the ICU for one additional day for frequent
suctioning, but the patient eventually refused this as well and
his secretions decreased within 24 hours. He was called out to
the floor with good O2 sats on face mask only.

The patient was transferred to the floor with the plan to go
home with hospice.  He continued to require 6L O2 on the floor
to maintain oxygenation >90%.  Hospice care was set up and the
paient was discharge home with hospice on [**2147-3-13**].
