Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1283**]
Chief Complaint:
Back and Abdominal Pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2187-11-29**] - Attempte Repair of Ruptured Aortic Aneurysm

History of Present Illness:
67 y/o female with h/o aortic aneurysm who presented with 2-3
days of heart burn which was much worse today. The pain radiated
to her back and abdomen and she was intubated. A CT scan
revealed an aortic aneurysm without extravasation of contrast.
She was thus transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.

PMR

Social History:
80 pack yr h/o smoking recently quitting.


Family History:

Intubated/sedated
Opens eyes to stimulation
LUNGS: Clear
HEART: RRR, no murmur
ABD: Obese, benign
EXT: 2+ PT pulses, no DP pulses felt, warm with good capillary
refill, no edema.

[**2187-11-29**] ECHO
No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of
the left
atrium or left atrial appendage. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%). The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. Trace aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial
mitral regurgitation.

The descending thoracic aorta is markedly dilated. The severe
dilatation
starts at the distal arch with what appears to be intramural
hematoma
superimposed upon severe atheromatous thickening of the media.
The intramural hematoma is almost circumferential with the
thickest portion measuring 1.6 cm in height in the anterior
aortic wall. The aneurysm measured 8cm in diameter at 35 cm from
the lip and 7cm x 6cm at 30 cm from the lip. An echogenic
density is seen at 35 cm, consistent with an intimal flap/aortic
dissection.

[**2187-11-30**] - ECHO
The patient came to the OR in extremis. She was resuscitated and
Fem-Carotid, and carotid-carotid grafts were done. The plan to
use endovascular grafts to repair the TAAA was aborted when the
femoral artery could not be accessed. The patient expired in the
OR.
We did have a chance to note that the large descending TAAA had
a great deal of clot around it, and that both ventricles were
compressed nearly completely. There was no AI and the ascending
aorta appeared normal. There was a small amount of MR, but there
was so little forward flow through the heart in spite of
inotropes and resuscitation with fluids and blood products, that
other measurements could not be done.

[**2187-11-28**] - CT Scan
1. No soft tissue stranding, circumferential fluid or contrast
extravasation from the repaired ascending aorta.
2. Large descending aortic aneurysm as described above. There is
no evidence of dissection flap, penetrating ulcer, or contrast
extravasation. A small left-sided pleural effusion is slightly
hyperdense without definite hematocrit level identified.
3. Aneurysmal right subclavian artery.
4. Right thyroid nodule as described above.

[**2187-11-29**] CXR
New pleural-based opacity extending over the upper aspect of the
left hemithorax with incomplete evaluation of the lateral lower
left chest as above. The presence of the new presumed loculated
effusion is worrisome given the presence of a known thoracic
aortic aneurysm. This may be indicative of rupture. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]
[**Doctor Last Name **], nurse practitioner, was informed of these findings at
9:50 a.m. on [**2187-11-30**].


Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2187-11-28**] for further
management of her aortic aneurysm. She was admitted to the ICU
and closely monitored. A TEE was performed which revealed a
dilated descending aorta with circumferential hematoma. There
was thought to be an area of dissection at the area which had a
protuberant atherosclerotic plaque. The cardiology service was
consulted for assistance given the likelihood of a high risk
reoperation. A chest x-ray on [**2187-11-29**] revealed a new loculated
effusion which was suggestive of an aortic rupture. Given these
findings, she was urgently taken to the operating room for
surgical management. All attempts were made by the cardiac
surgical service in conjunction with the vascular surgery
service to surgically repair her aneurysm however Ms. [**Known lastname **] [**Last Name (Titles) 69415**]d in the operating room at 1:39AM [**2187-11-30**].
