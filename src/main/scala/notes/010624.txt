CT abdomen:
1. Diffuse colonic distention (with risk of perforation) and
mesenteric/portal venous gas. The differential includes
shock/dehydration-induced ischemia, hypercoagulability secondary
to multiple myeloma, immunotherapy/chemotherapy drug effects,
less likely inflammatory/infectious syndrome following stem cell
transplant.
2. Possible median arcuate ligament syndrome; please correlate
clinically.
3. Normal appendix.
4. Small hiatal hernia and reflux esophagitis.
5. Small airways disease.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 1557**] was admitted to the SICU for close monitoring due to
his adbominal distension and concerning CT scan. Serial exams
were performed and there were no signs of worsening abdominal
pain or distension. He was resuscitated with IVF and kept NPO.
Overnight on HD#1, he began to pass flatus and had a small bowel
movement. His abdominal distension improved. Bone marrow
transplant was consulted for recommendations regarding his
chemotherapy. They did not feel that his colonic distension was
from the experimental chemotherapy, though could not be sure.
Lovenox was stopped due to small amount of blood on rectal exam.
His foley was removed on HD#2 and he was transferred to the
floor.

On the floor his vital signs were routinely monitored and
remained stable. He remained afebrile without leukocytosis or
evidence of infection. His home acyclovir and mepron were
restarted and empiric coverage with cipro and flagyl was
continued. His hematocrit was rmonitored and remained stable.
His abdominal distention continued to improve and his diet was
slowly advanced as tolerated. He voided after removal of the
foley, and his intake and output were continually monitored. He
was encouraged to mobilize out of bed and ambulate as tolerated,
which he was able to do independently with a steady gait. His
lovenox was restarted at his prior dose upon discharge.

On [**2187-11-28**], he is afebrile and hemodynamically stable. He feels
well and is tolerating a regular diet. Prior to discharge he had
a BM and his abdominal exam is improved. He is out of bed
ambulating independently. He is being discharged home with
follow up with his oncologists.
