CTA OF THE CHEST:  The CTA portion of the exam is somewhat
limited due to the slow circulation time of the contrast bolus.
No pulmonary embolus is
identified.  The pulmonary vessels are even somewhat better
evaluated on the delayed scan, though the sections are not as
thin on this base.  No definite pulmonary embolus is identified.


CT OF THE CHEST WITHOUT AND WITH CONTRAST:  The heart is
enlarged.  The right atrium and ventricle in particular are very
large, and there is evidence of tricuspid regurgitation.  There
is reflux of contrast into the IVC and hepatic veins, consistent
with right heart failure.  There is a large pericardial effusion
present.  There is delayed circulation of contrast into the left
side of the heart.  There are aortic calcifications and coronary
artery calcifications.  No pulmonary mass is identified.  There
are patchy areas of atelectasis within the lungs, greater at the
bases.  There is a small right-sided pleural effusion.  The
airways are patent to the level of the segmental bronchi
bilaterally.  There is a prevascular lymph node adjacent to the
aortic arch, which measures 6 mm in short axis dimension.  There
are axillary nodes bilaterally that are somewhat prominent.

CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH CONTRAST:  The inferior vena cava is
enlarged,
consistent with the patient's right heart failure.  The liver
demonstrates a somewhat lobulated contour, which may be related
to the patient's heart
failure and hepatic congestion, though other forms of liver
disease cannot be excluded and should be evaluated.  The
gallbladder, spleen, pancreas, and adrenals are normal.  The
kidneys enhance symmetrically and excrete normally.  The
stomach, small and large bowels are unremarkable.  There is no
free air within the abdomen.  There is a small amount of ascites
fluid.  No pathologically enlarged retroperitoneal or mesenteric
lymph nodes are identified.  The abdominal aorta is of normal
caliber, and the proximal celiac, SMA, bilateral renal arteries,
and [**Female First Name (un) 899**] are patent.  Within the left lower abdomen and pelvis,
there are variceal vessels present that extend superiorly to
join the left renal vein.  There is enlargement of the left
renal vein and inferior vena cava.  These findings could be
related to portal hypertension.

Within the subcutaneous tissues of the anterior abdominal wall,
there are
small rounded hyperdense lesions that are scattered within the
intra-abdominal wall.  There is a tiny focus of air associated
with one of these lesions.  These lesions may represent areas of
heparin injection in this inpatient, but clinical correlation is
requested.

CT OF THE PELVIS WITH CONTRAST:  The bladder, uterus and rectum
are
unremarkable.  There may be an occasional diverticulum of the
sigmoid colon.  There is no evidence of acute diverticulitis.
No pathologically enlarged pelvic or inguinal lymph nodes are
identified.  There are small lymph nodes within the inguinal
regions bilaterally.

BONE WINDOWS:  There are no suspicious osteolytic or sclerotic
lesions.  There are degenerative changes of the spine.

Multiplanar reformatted images were essential in delineating the
anatomy and pathology in this case (grade 1).

IMPRESSION:
1)  No evidence of pulmonary embolus.
2)  Large pericardial effusion with evidence of right heart
failure.  The
inferior vena cava is enlarged and there is reflux of contrast
into the
hepatic veins.  There is delay of contrast filling on the left
side of the
heart.
3)  Coronary artery calcification and calcification of the
aorta.
4)  Lobulated liver contour with varices within the pelvis that
communicate with the left renal vein, which is enlarged.  Those
findings may represent portal hypertension.  While these
findings could be related to hepatic congestion related to the
patient's heart failure, other forms of liver disease cannot be
excluded and should be evaluated.
5)  Soft tissue hyperdense rounded lesions within the anterior
abdominal wall. These may represent areas of heparin injection
in this inpatient, but clinical correlation is requested.
6)  Distal ureters.  There is ascites fluid present, which is
mild to moderate in amount.

INTERPRETATION:

Findings:

This study was compared to the prior study of [**2114-4-13**].


RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Markedly dilated RA.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Overall normal LVEF (>55%).

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Dilated RV cavity. RV function depressed.
Abnormal septal
motion/position consistent with RV pressure/volume overload.

AORTIC VALVE: Normal aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS. No AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. Mild to
moderate ([**12-24**]+)
MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Mildly thickened tricuspid valve leaflets.
Severe [4+] TR.

PERICARDIUM: Trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. The
pericardium may be
thickened. No echocardiographic signs of tamponade. No RA or RV
diastolic
collapse. No significant respiratory variation in
mitral/tricuspid valve
flows.

Conclusions:
The right atrium is markedly dilated. Overall left ventricular
systolic
function
