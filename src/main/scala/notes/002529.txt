Left Atrium - Long Axis Dimension:  *4.8 cm  <= 4.0 cm
Left Ventricle - Inferolateral Thickness:  *1.2 cm  0.6 - 1.1 cm

Left Ventricle - Ejection Fraction:  45% to 55%  >= 55%

Findings
LEFT ATRIUM: Mild LA enlargement. No spontaneous echo contrast
is seen in the LAA. Depressed LAA emptying velocity (<0.2m/s) No
thrombus in the LAA.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Normal RA size. A catheter or
pacing wire is seen in the RA and extending into the RV. No ASD
by 2D or color Doppler.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Mild symmetric LVH. Normal LV cavity size. Mild
regional LV systolic dysfunction.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTA: Normal aortic diameter at the sinus level. Normal
ascending aorta diameter. Mildly dilated aortic arch. Simple
atheroma in aortic arch. Normal descending aorta diameter.
Simple atheroma in descending aorta.

AORTIC VALVE: Three aortic valve leaflets. Moderately thickened
aortic valve leaflets. Moderate AS (area 1.0-1.2cm2) Mild (1+)
AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. Trivial
MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets with trivial
TR.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Mild PR.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify I was present in compliance with HCFA
regulations. The patient was under general anesthesia throughout
the procedure. The patient received antibiotic prophylaxis. The
TEE probe was passed with assistance from the anesthesioology
staff using a laryngoscope. No TEE related complications.
patient.

REGIONAL LEFT VENTRICULAR WALL MOTION:





     N = Normal, H = Hypokinetic, A = Akinetic, D = Dyskinetic
Conclusions
PRE-CPB:1. The left atrium is mildly dilated. No spontaneous
echo contrast is seen in the left atrial appendage. The left
atrial appendage emptying velocity is depressed (<0.2m/s). No
thrombus is seen in the left atrial appendage.
2. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
3. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The
left ventricular cavity size is normal. There is mild regional
left ventricular systolic dysfunction with mid inferolateral
hypokinesis.
4. . Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal.
5. The aortic arch is mildly dilated. There are simple atheroma
in the aortic arch. There are simple atheroma in the descending
thoracic aorta.
6. There are three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve
leaflets are moderately thickened with calcification and limited
motion of the noncoronary cusp. There is moderate aortic valve
stenosis (valve area 1.0-1.2cm2). Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation
is seen.
7. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial
mitral regurgitation is seen.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in person of the results.

POST-CPB: On infusion of phenylephrine. AV pacing. Well-seated
bioprosthetic valve in the aortic position. No AI. Gradient post
CPB is 32 mmHg. Preserved biventricular systolic function. LVEF
is now 50%. Trace MR. [**First Name (Titles) **] aortic contour is normal post
decannulation.
  I certify that I was present for this procedure in compliance
with HCFA regulations.

Brief Hospital Course:
On [**2177-1-20**] Mr. [**Known lastname **] [**Last Name (Titles) 1834**] an Aortic valve replacement and
coronary artery bypass grafting times three.  This procedure was
performed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  Please see the operative note for
details.  He tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to
the surgical intensive care unit in critical but stable
condition.  He was extubated and weaned from his drips.  His
chest tubes and wires were removed. He was transferred to the
surgical step down floor and was seen in consultation by the
physical therapy service.  By post operative day 5 he was ready
for discharge to home.
