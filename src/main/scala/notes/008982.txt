Service: CARDIOTHORACIC

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 165**]
Chief Complaint:
syncope

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Minimally invasive tricuspid valve replacement (#27 TVR tissue)


History of Present Illness:
This 20-year-old patient with
previous tricuspid valve endocarditis following an elective
abortion was initially medically managed but subsequently
developed continuing worsening severe tricuspid regurgitation
with severe right ventricular dilatation in a short span of
time with episodes of syncopal attacks. After confirming the
above findings with subsequent echoes, a decision was made to
proceed with tricuspid valve replacement. Preoperatively, she
had completed a few weeks course of antibiotics and was
infection free. The plan was to proceed with a minimally
invasive tricuspid valve replacement with a tissue valve.

Asthma
Tricuspid valve endocarditis

Findings
RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: A catheter or pacing wire is
seen in the RA. No ASD by 2D or color Doppler.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Overall normal LVEF (>55%).

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Markedly dilated RV cavity. Moderate global RV
free wall hypokinesis.

AORTA: Normal aortic diameter at the sinus level. Normal
ascending aorta diameter. Normal descending aorta diameter.

AORTIC VALVE: Normal aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS. No AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Normal mitral valve leaflets with trivial MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Partial flail of a tricuspid valve leaflet.
Tricuspid leaflets do not fully coapt. Severe [4+] TR.

PERICARDIUM: Trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify I was present in compliance with HCFA
regulations. The patient was under general anesthesia throughout
the procedure. No TEE related complications. The patient appears
to be in sinus rhythm. Results were personally reviewed with the
MD caring for the patient.
Conclusions
Prebypass

No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). The
right ventricular cavity is markedly dilated with moderate
global free wall hypokinesis. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no
aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve appears structurally
normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is partial flail
of a tricuspid valve leaflet. The tricuspid valve leaflets fail
to fully coapt. Severe [4+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in person of the results on [**2187-2-5**]
at 1200 noon.

Postbypass:

Post bypass study performed by Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 3893**]
Normal LVEF 55%. Mild global RV hypokinesis. A bioprosthesis
seen in the native tricuspid valve position is stable and
functioning well. Trans triscupid mean gradient was found to be
7 to 9mm of Hg and was conveyed to the surgeon as the leaflets
seem to open well. Intact thoracic aorta. Aortic and mitral
valve appear normal.
  I certify that I was present for this procedure in compliance
with HCFA regulations.

CXR

HISTORY: MINI TVR.

FINDINGS: In comparison with study of [**2-6**], the central
catheter has been
removed. The lung volumes are slightly improved. Enlargement of
the cardiac
silhouette persists without definite vascular congestion.
Bilateral pleural
effusions are again seen, with retrocardiac opacification
consistent with
atelectasis. The possibility of pneumonia would have to be
considered if
there were appropriate clinical symptoms.

The area of subcutaneous gas collection in the right lateral
chest wall is
again seen. The stomach is no longer distended.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms [**Known lastname **] was admitted on [**2188-2-4**] and taken to the operating
room for a minimally invasive tricuspid valve replacement (#27
tissue). See operative note for details.
post operatively she was admiited to the intensive care unit
intubated and sedated. She awoke and was weaned from the
ventilator and extubated. Her chest tubes and pacing wires were
removed per protocol. She was started on betablockers,
diuretics. She was evaluated and treated by physical therapy and
cleared for discharge to home. Social services was consulted
regarding housing upon discharge and appropriate housing was
arranged. Ms. [**Known lastname **] was discharged to home on POD#4
