hypoglycemic episodes.  Transitioning now to oral hypoglycemics
with SSI coverage.  Hypernatremia was corrected with appropriate

Brief Hospital Course:
Assessment: [**Age over 90 **]yoF with CHF, recent SBE, CVA, p/w new onset AFib,
hypernatremia, hyperglycemia and MS changes.
.
1. MS changes: On admission pt was very confused/delirious.
Improved since admission, still possibly with some element of
delerium, oriented to person only. With baseline dementia. Alert
and interactive.  Had head CT without acute abnl and no focal
neuro findings aside from old CVA.  Hypernatremia was corrected
with fluids (see below) and neuro exam was monitored,
unremarkable.
.
2. Hyperglycemia: no previously documented h/o diabetes, though
had routine chem7 with glucose >200 while at [**Hospital 100**] rehab.
Insulin gtt in ICU was stopped within 24h, then started on SSI,
but with occasional hypoglycemic episodes.  Electrolytes were
aggressively repleted.  On [**7-5**] transitioned to oral
hypoglycemic [**Doctor Last Name 360**] and covered with SSI.  BG well-controlled.
Prior to discharge avandia was d/c'd. Covered with SSI in-house.
 Once discharged FS will be monitored and covered w/SSI. Oral
[**Doctor Last Name 360**] can be restarted if needed.  Hgb A1c 8.7
.
3. HyperNatremia: Admission Na of 161 (170s when corrected for
hyperglycemia), trended down with appropriate hydration. Pt
first received NS for volume repleteion. Then switched to 1/2NS
and then to D5W.  IVF was stopped with Na143 on [**7-5**], restarted
on [**7-6**] with Na 148.  Na normalized prior to discharge after D5W
administration
.
4. A-fib: Pt was reportedly in sinus rhythm normally at rehab.
Has had episodes of afib in the past per records.  Dig loaded
[**7-4**] and also started on metoprolol for tachycardia.  Digoxin
0.0625mg daily.  Metoprolol 12.5 [**Hospital1 **].  HR well-controlled with
these medications.  TSH was normal.  Pt was on telemetry in the
ICU, off on the floor.  Anticoagulation can be considered as
part of the long-term plan, but was not started on this
admission because of uncertain fall risk.
.
5. UTI - UA with >50 WBC, few bacteria, many yeast, [**2-26**] epith.,
urine cx with yeast. Was febrile with leukocytosis (max 24.6) on
admission. WBC has decreased and pt defervesced on abx
(ceftriaxone started [**7-4**], changed to PO cefpodoxime for total 7
day course).  Foley was removed.  Repeat UA: mod leuk, 57 WBC,
many bacteria, mod yeast, 4 epi (after 3 days abx).
Repeat Urine Cx was pending at time of discharge. Pt will
complete 7 day abx course after discharge.
.
6. Hx of SBE: Given fever and leukocytosis on admission,
vancomycin was started on admission because of past history of
SBE.  UA indicates urine most likely source, pt treated with
ceftriaxone for UTI.  Blood Cx NGTD after 3 days.  Not finalized
yet, but vanco discontinued.
.
6. Anemia: Iron studies (Iron 17, ferritin 25, TIBC 321) c/w
iron deficiency anemia.
Started iron.  B12/folate levels normal.  Given hx of CAD and
current Hct 28.5, transfused 1U PRBCs to correct anemia.
.
7. CAD / CHF: EF reported as 35% with some inf WMA; pedal edema
on exam  Treatment with Dig and metoprolol for A-fib as above.
Added ACE-I for afterload reduction. Given SBP in low 100s,
started at 5mg QD. BP remained 100s/60s so did not increase
dose.
.
