History of Present Illness:
Pt is a 50 yo male w/ PMHx sig for HTN and lip cancer s/p
resection who presented to [**Hospital 1474**] hospital after episode of
loss of consciousness found to have a reported SAH.  Earlier in
the afternoon, he went to speak with a neighbor who was building
a fence and took down a portion of the patient's fence.  Pt was
angry and confronted neighbor and apparently lost consciousness.
 The next thing he remembers is waking up at an OSH with a large
headache.  A head CT revealed SAH blood in the suprasellar
cistern, Sylvian fissure, and intra hemispheric fissure.  Pt was
hypertensive to the 180s/115s.  He was given IV Labetolol and
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management

CTA on Admission:
IMPRESSION: Diffuse subarachnoid hemorrhage in the basal
cisterns, sylvian
fissure, interhemispheric fissure, and in the sulci of the
frontal lobe
bilaterally. No midline shift of normally placed structures.
Aneurysm at the anterior communicating artery measuring 6 x 3
mm, pointing
inferiorly and anteriorly, with irregularity on right. No
vasospasm.

Pre-op Chest X-ray:
IMPRESSION: AP chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest
radiographs:
Lungs are fully expanded and clear and the mediastinum is
midline. There is no evidence of volume loss, or central
adenopathy. Study does not represent a reasonable assessment of
central airways, however. Lung periphery is clear. Heart size
top normal. No pleural abnormality.

Post-Embolization CT:
ATTENDING NOTE: Less apparent SAH could be due to
redistribution. No new
hemorrhage. No loss of GW differentiation. Ventricles slightly
prominent but unchanged. Decrease in extent of diffuse
subarachnoid hemorrhage, no new hemorrhage. Status post coiling
of the Acom aneurysm.

MRI of Head [**7-13**]:
TECHNIQUE: Axial T2-weighted images of the brain were obtained.
Arterial
spin-labeling MR perfusion study was performed. Dynamic
susceptibility
contrast MR perfusion study was performed during intravenous
gadolinium
administration.

FINDINGS: A complete evaluation of the brain was not performed
with this
study. Axial T2-weighted images demonstrate multiple foci of
high signal in the subcortical and deep white matter of the
cerebral hemispheres,
corresponding to hypodensities noted on the head CT of [**2139-7-11**],
which are
nonspecific. The ventricles and sulci are normal in size and
configuration.
There is a mucus retention cyst in the left maxillary sinus and
mild mucosal thickening in the left sphenoid sinus.

No perfusion abnormalities are identified on the MR perfusion
study.

IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of perfusion abnormalities.
2. Multiple foci of high T2 signal in the white matter of the
cerebral
hemispheres, which are nonspecific in a patient of this age.
Further
evaluation may be performed by a complete brain MRI.



Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 7049**] was admitted after being transferred from an OSH with
a
spontaneous SAH. A CTA revealed an aneurysm at the anterior
communicating artery measuring 6 x 3 mm. The patient was
admitted to the ICU for hourly neuro checks and was started on
nimodipine. On [**7-10**] he had an angiogram by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] and the
aneurysm was coiled at that time. The procedure went well and he
felt that the vessel was secured afterwards. The patient went
back to the ICU following the angio. He was neurologically
intact throughout his whole stay in the ICU. Mr. [**Known lastname 7049**] did have
headaches and some nausea and vomiting that improved with
medication. His blood pressure was maintained at < 200 systolic
in order to profuse the brain. On [**7-15**] the patient had a CTA
which was reviewed by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] who felt there was no
significant vasospasm present. The patient was also treated with
dilantin to prevent seizures during his hospital course.

On [**7-15**] the patient was transferred to the stepdown unit since
he was doing well neurologically. He had Q 2 neuro checks. The
patient was given metoprolol, lisinopril, and nimodipine while
in the stepdown unit. His blood pressure was still elevated, but
< 200 systolic.

On [**7-17**] he had an episode of an acute headache and vomiting. The
headache resolved after he vomited and the patient had no
neurologic changes. He had a stat head CT which revealed no
hydrocephalus and no new hemorrhage. He was evaluated by
physical therapy who felt that he was safe to ambulate without
assistance and that he was safe to be discharged. Neurologically
he was oriented x 3, cranial nerves intact, full strength and
sensation throughout, no pronator drift. The patient was
discharged with enough nimodpine for the weekend and his
pharmacy will have the remaining portion ready on Monday
morning. He will complete a total of 21 days of therapy on
[**2139-7-29**].
