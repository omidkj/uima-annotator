Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 398**]
Chief Complaint:
Reason for ICU: hypotension requiring pressors, intubated for
hypercarbic respiratory arrest

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
intubation

History of Present Illness:
63 yo M with hx of schizophrenia and anxiety, s/p splenectomy
who presented on [**5-26**] to [**Hospital3 934**] Hospital with
complaints of 3.5 weeks of left sided chest and abdominal pain x
several days. He described the pain to the OSH MDs as associated
with SOB, no rhinorrhea/chills, constant, no associated N/V. No
change with position or food, mild dysuria and frequency. He
reported black BMs x few days. He reported to the GI MDs that he
continues to drink 2 beers per day and 4 ounces of gin. He
denied any tylenol use recently but takes bufferin for pain.
.
At the OSH, his initial vitals were 97.4, HR 178, RR 36, BP
136/100, 98% on RA. His EKG was read as SVT. He was given dilt
10 mg IV x 2, lopressor 25 mg IV x 1 and unasyn 3g IV x 1 for a
question of diverticulitis. His Cr was notable to be 1.6 and AST
510 and ALT 338. He was hydrated, ruled out for MI, and was seen
by cardiology, GI, and surgery and ID. Had an ultrasound with
gallstones and negative HIDA scan. Abd CT with minimal ascites
and diverticulosis but no evidence of infection. Chest CTA was
also done given widened mediastinum which was reportedly
negative. Over the course of the next 2 days, developed
increasing LFTs to the [**2166**] range and INR increased to 3.0. His
hepatitis A/B/C work-up was negative and he had a tylenol lvl
<10 on arrival to the OSH. He slowly became more confused and
lethargic. Slipped and fell without hitting his head, Pulled out
his foley. His lactate on 24th was noted to be 3.0. He then
earlier today developed increasing RR into the 30s with sats low
80s and was intubated for hypercarbic resp arrest. He was
started on levophed for unclear BPs (supposedly low) and was
maintained on a beta-blocker for tachycardia. He was noted to
have minimal urine output. He was transferred here for further
evaluation.

([**2172-5-28**]) RIGHT UPPER QUADRANT ULTRASOUND: The liver is
diffusely echogenic consistent with fatty infiltration. No focal
hepatic lesion is identified. There are a few small shadowing
gallstones in the gallbladder but no wall thickening or
pericholecystic fluid. The common duct is not dilated measuring
5 mm. There is no intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation. There
is a small amount of perihepatic and lower quadrant ascites.

Doppler evaluation demonstrates absence of color flow in the
main portal vein consistent with thrombosis. The hepatic veins
are patent. Arterial waveform is demonstrated in the main
hepatic artery but due to technical scanning difficulties, the
left and right hepatic arteries are not identified.

IMPRESSION:

1. Absence of Doppler flow in the portal vein consistent with
portal vein thrombosis.

2. Cholelithiasis without evidence of cholecystitis.

3. Fatty infiltration of the liver. More significant disease
such as cirrhosis or fibrosis or underlying mass cannot be
excluded.

4. Small amount of perihepatic and lower quadrant ascites.

CXR  [**2172-5-28**].

The ET tube is 5.5 cm above the carina in good position. A right
internal jugular central catheter tip is in mid SVC. The NG tube
tip is in the stomach. The severe widening of the mediastinum
and the enlarged cardiac silhouette are unchanged. The concern
is about possible aortic pathology or pericardial effusion. The
lungs are clear except for left lower lobe consolidation. There
is bilateral small pleural effusion, unchanged.
.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 63 yo M w/ hx of schizophrenia and anxiety s/p remote
splenectomy who presented from OSH with fulminant hepatic
failure, acute renal failure, hypercarbic respiratory arrest s/p
intubation, hypotension on pressors who presents here for
further evaluation.
.
# Sepsis - the patient was started on an empiric course of
zosyn, levofloxacin for broad antibacterial coverage.  Sepsis
physiology resolved and pressors were weaned off.  No source of
infection was identified despite multiple blood, urine cx's, CXR
without evidence of pneumonia.  Pt scheduled to complete a 14
day course of the antibiotics.

# Resp failure - initially intubated in setting of sepsis,
airway protection.  He received significant amount of fluids for
volume resuscitation in setting of sepsis, was about 10L
positive initially.  Oxygenation and ventilation were
maintained, and he was extubated on [**6-4**].  Initially he was noted
to have elevated pCO2 to the 50's, although no baseline is
available.  Suspect that he may have a component of OSA and
obesity hypoventilation syndrome.  Ventilation improved on lower
amounts of FIO2, able to weane to nasal cannula.  Initiated
BIPAP for overnight support, will need outpatient sleep study to
evaluate for OSA.
.
# Liver failure: noted to have markedly elevated LFTs, thought
to be shock liver from hypotension.  Tylenol level noted to be
<10, and he did received 14 doses of NAC, although low suspicion
for tylenol toxicity.  Viral hepatitis serologies were negative.
 LFTs trended down with hemodynamic support.  He was given
lactulose while liver function was poor to prevent
encephalopathy.  His lipase  and amylase were noted to be
slightly increase, however, nl alk phos and bilirubin as well as
benign abdominal exam did not sug
