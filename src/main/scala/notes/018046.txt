History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 93451**] is a 50yo F with complicated PMH including sclerosing
mesenteritis who presents from home with dizziness and decreased
UOP x 1 day. She initially came to [**Hospital1 **] today to be seen by the IV
access team due to redness and swelling in the R groin after
exchange of her CVL a few days ago. She made herself NPO at 630
this AM in case she required any intervention for her line.

Of note, multiple recent admissions, most recently [**Date range (1) 93571**]
for ?SBO. Ultimately, it was felt that her increased pain was
"multifactorial from both physical and emotional pain." Her
G-tube and fem line for TPN were both re-placed that admission.
For insurance/financial reasons, pt was unable to get home fluid
boluses, although did continue her usual TPN. She is able to
take a small amount of po at baseline.

In the ED, initial VS were: T97, HR 83, BP 83/50, RR 18, 98% RA
In the ED, she was given 3.5L NS and pressures were in the
80s-low 90s. Baseline pressure per OMR 110s. FSG 60 in ED, but
came up with D5W.

On arrival to the MICU, patient's VS BP 122/89, HR 76, RR 18,
100% RA.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 93451**] is a 50yo F with complicated PMH including sclerosing
mesenteritis who presents from home with dizziness and decreased
UOP x 1 day found to have systolic BP in the 80s in the setting
of being unable to recieve IVF boluses as prescribed and no po
intake for > 12 hours.

# Hypovolemic hypotension: the patient has not used her home IV
fluids for some time because of insurance issues. On day of
admission she held her PO intake in case she needed a procedure
for R femoral venous catheter. These 2 events led to her
hypotension. She was admitted to the ICU and quickly recovered
w/ aggressive IVF. Infection on differential but less likely;
blood and urine cultures were negative, no empiric abx were
given.

# R groin pain: has a femoral venous catheter for home TPN.
Given pain from tunnelled site the patient had the catheter
re-tunnelled during this hospitalization.

# Chronic pain: on morphine suppositories, increased on recent
admission from 20mg q6h to 25mg q6h. Patient reports no relief
with this increase. She states honestly that if she continues to
uptitrate it without relief, she may discontinue altogether
because she sees no purpose in taking higher doses of an
ineffective opioid.  She was treated with IV dilaudid 1mg doses
while in house for additional pain control; it was noted that
she was not admitted for any acute pain issues and therefore her
home narcotics are not to be changed for discharge.  We would
recommend she continue outpatient pain mgmt and have an
established narcotics contract. Patient was discharged with a
script for morphine suppositories as the script that her pain
management doctor had sent was lost in the mail.

INACTIVE ISSUES:
# Abdominal pain, sclerosing mesenteritis: Pt followed by Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 79**] as well as Pain Mangement.
- Continued home regimen: gabapentin, morphine PR
- Gets monthly Lupron injections

# Depression/anxiety: Likely contributing to chonic pain per
medical and SW assesment last admission. Pt endorsing worsening
of her depression and frustration with multiple
hospitalizations.
- Con't home meds: Lamotrigine, Abilify, trazodone, lorazepam
- Clonidine patch held
- seen by psychiatry and social work

# Migraines: continude home Butorphanol and Sumatriptan.

# anemia: Pt currently above baseline Hct (29-32).
- Continued home ferrous sulfate.

# Hypothroidsim: Continued home levothyroxine
# Code: DNR DNI(confirmed)
