Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2712**]
Chief Complaint:
confusion

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none


History of Present Illness:
 [**Age over 90 **]M w/ h/o CHF, CAD s/p NSTEMI, Afib on dabigatran, brought in
by his son due to confusion lethargy and markedly slurred speech
for approximately one week. At baseline, he has clear speech, is
oriented, and can walk independently for very short distances.
Per the patient's son, the patient has had no specific
complaints, however for the last week and a half he has had
slurred speech and dizziness. He was recently changed from
Plavix to dabigatran. [**2108-10-30**] he was seen in the ED for hypoxia
and discharged on an increased dose of Lasix 120mg daily.
[**2108-11-19**] his son called his cardiologist's office with a
complaint of dizziness. The next day he was noted to be
hypotensive with a pressure 70/60. His lasix was held, but he
continued to have symptoms. This morning, his son held all his
medications except for ASA 81 and dabigatran. He has had a
couple of mild episodes of epistaxis. He continued to have
slurred speech and hypotension, so he was brought in to the ED.

.
In the ED, initial vs were: 86.9 50 120/48 18, on a
Non-Rebreather. Noted to have an intact neuro exam except for
incomprehensible speech. Started on bair hugger and given warmed
fluids. Found to have guaiac positive brown stool. SBPs down to
the 70s, so a R IJ was placed. Head CT negative. CXR showed
chronic R sided effusion. Soon after 98% on RA. Patient was
given vanc, zosyn and 3L IV fluids. He was given 1 unit PRBC's.
lactate 2.0.
.
On the floor, patient is coherent, though his speech remains
slurred. He denies pain and is unable to provide further ROS.

Social History:
The patient lives with his wife of 72 years and his son. [**Name (NI) **] has
a visiting nurse come once per week and nurses aid several times
per week. He is able to walk up the stairs by himself, but his
son always walks with him.

ECHO
The left atrium is moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric
left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size
is normal. There is severe regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction with anteroseptal/anterior hypokinesis/akinesis with
apical akinesis/dyskinesis. Right ventricular chamber size and
free wall motion are normal. [Intrinsic right ventricular
systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of
tricuspid regurgitation.] The aortic root is mildly dilated at
the sinus level. The aortic valve leaflets are severely
thickened/deformed. There is aortic valve stenosis which is
probably severe (valve area 0.8-1.0cm2) but the gradient is low;
since left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed
is possible that the aortic valve area would be larger with a
higher stroke volume. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. Mild to moderate ([**1-8**]+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the
severity of mitral regurgitation may be significantly
UNDERestimated.] The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Severe [4+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is
severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is an
anterior space which most likely represents a prominent fat pad.




Brief Hospital Course:
[**Age over 90 **]M w/ h/o CHF, CAD, Afib on dabigatran, brought by his son due
to confusion lethargy and markedly slurred speech for
approximately one week. He was found to have a pneumonia and was
treated with antibiotics. He also had an anemia, likely
secondary to GI blood loss secondary to decreased clearance of
dabigaran in the setting of renal impairment. Despite
antibiotics, he worsened and the decision was made to transition
to comfort-oriented care. He passed away comfortably at 11:05 pm
on [**11-24**].
