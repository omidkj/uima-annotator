HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 58-year-old
female with diabetes, coronary artery disease, peripheral
vascular disease, and hypertension who presented to an
outside hospital with severe substernal chest pain, dyspnea,
and ruled in for MI by enzymes.  The patient was transferred
to the [**Hospital3 **] Medical Center for cardiac
catheterization.  The patient's presentation began at
approximately 2:00 a.m. with shortness of breath and [**10-12**]
substernal chest pain and was taken to the Emergency
Department at the outside hospital by the patient's daughter.
The patient's saturation at the time was 78% on room air.
The patient was noted to have EKG changes with acute ST
depressions in leads V3 through V6, aVF and V3.  The patient
was also noted to be in CHF at this time.  The patient was
given sublingual nitroglycerin as well as Lasix and aspirin
with corresponding resolution of pain.  The patient was also
initiated on a heparin drip prior to arriving to [**Hospital6 1760**].

Cardiac catheterization on [**2103-6-11**] revealed LMCA 80%,
LAD subtotal mid, severe diffuse mid and distal disease,
approximately 80% D1, LCX 70% origin, diffuse up to 70% mid,
RCA 80% proximal and mid, 80% PLV, other 70% RAMUS diseased
vessels were determined.  Given these findings, CT surgical
evaluation was sought by the Medicine Service.

LABORATORY/RADIOLOGIC DATA:  On [**2103-6-15**], white blood
cell count 9.1, hematocrit 24.6, platelet 183,000.  Sodium
136, potassium 4.3, chloride 99, bicarbonate 28, BUN 26,
creatinine 0.9, glucose 163, magnesium 1.8, calcium 8.5,

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient is a 58-year-old female with a
known history of coronary artery disease, unstable angina,
insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, hypertension, peripheral
vascular disease, who underwent an uncomplicated CABG times
four, LIMA to DIAG, SVG to PDA, SVG to left PL, LAD
sequential on [**2103-6-12**].

Postoperatively, the patient was taken to the CSRU for close
monitoring, where upon the patient was promptly extubated,
maintaining good saturation on 4 liters nasal cannula in
normal sinus rhythm.

By postoperative day number one, the patient's Lopressor was
initiated at 25 mg p.o. b.i.d. and Swan discontinued.  At
this time, the chest tube was also removed and the patient
was transferred to the floor.  By postoperative day number
two, the patient's metoprolol was titrated to 50 mg p.o.
b.i.d.  At this time, the [**Initials (NamePattern4) 228**] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 1661**]-[**Location (un) 1662**] drain was
removed along with the remainder of the lateral chest tubes.

As the patient's physical recovery was remarkably rapid,
Physical Therapy evaluation was sought, at which time the
patient achieved level V goal cardiac discharge criteria by
postoperative day number three.  At that time, the patient's
sternal wires were removed and the decision was made to
discharge the patient in good condition.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Good.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  To home.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:  Status post CABG times four (LIMA to
DIAG, SVG to PDA, SVG to left PL, LAD sequential).
