Chief Complaint:
Found unresponsive.

History of Present Illness:
This is a 57 year old homeless male with PMH of CHF, A. fib, DM,
psoriasis, OSA; found unresponsive at the hotel where he lives.
He was found between the bed and the wall, unclear how long the
pt was unresponsive. He was initially taken to [**Hospital3 **],
but was transferred here because he was too large to fit in the
scanner. At the OSH ED he was intermittently lucid, tachy to
140s and 88% on RA. He was given IV Narcan for acute AMS w/o
improvement. Nothing else revealing on workup (unrevealing
cardiac enzymes, UA, glucose, Utox and EtOH neg). ABG
7.36/60/60/34 on 4L/NC. WBC 12.6. Ceftriaxone/flagyl for
possible aspiration pneumonia and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]. In the
[**Hospital1 18**] ED, vitals were T 98, HR 108, BP 136/72, RR 24, 98% on RA.
He was intubated for unclear reasons. Received ceftriaxone,
vancomycin, and acyclovir as empiric coverage for meningitis.
Given flagyl for unclear reasons. LP could not be performed
(?attempted). A CXR showed ?RUL infiltrate. A CT head,
abd/pelvis could not be performed due to size. He was continued
on a dilt drip.

Patient admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] on [**3-6**]. Continued on the above
antibiotic regimen. Had CT head, which was negative for acute
bleed. Attempt at LP was unsuccessful (could only hit bone). TTE
performed and uninterpretable due to body habitus. TEE fellow
[**Month/Year (2) 653**] for possible TEE, on hold currently. Weaned off dilt
gtt. Neuro consulted. EEG performed. Woke up and was apparently
violent so placed on propofol.

Patient was recently hospitalized at the [**Location 1268**] VA [**2034-2-19**]
w/ nonexertional CP and tx for CHF exacerbation. Pt's coumadin
was stopped at that time because of being extremely noncompliant
and f/u meds.

Congestive heart failure
Atrial fibrillation
Diabetes
Psoriasis
Obstructive sleep apnea
Morbid obesity

.
Chest x-ray [**2124-3-5**]: AP supine chest radiograph is obtained
portably. The patient is quite rotated to his right and motion
artifact significantly limits evaluation. Due to the extreme
limitations of the study, evaluation is deemed non-diagnostic
and repeat study is recommended.
.
CT head [**2124-3-6**]: No evidence of intracranial hemorrhage, edema,
mass effect, or infarction. The ventricles and sulci are normal
in size and configuration. There are no fractures. Visualized
paranasal structures are notable for mucosal thickening at the
sphenoid and ethmoidal air cells, more prominently on the right.

.
EEG [**2124-3-7**]: This is an abnormal routine EEG in the waking and
sleeping states due to the presence of delta frequency slowing
intermixed with a normal background. This finding can be seen
with mild encephalopathy, medication effect, or extreme
drowsiness. There were no focal abnormalities or epileptiform
features noted. Note is also made of an irregular cardiac rhythm
with a tachycardia.
.
CT head [**2124-3-14**]: No hemorrhage or mass effect.
.
CXR [**3-26**]: REASON FOR EXAM: Acute desaturation.
.
Comparison is made with prior study [**3-21**]. Still mild
pulmonary edema has markedly improved. There are linear
atelectasis in the left base. There is mild to moderate
cardiomegaly. There are no enlarging pleural effusions.
.

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 57 year old male with morbid obesity, OSA, DM, Afib,
CHF, here with altered mental status leading to intubation, now
extubated with improving mental status.

# Altered mental status: Patient was initially found to be
obtunded. This was of unclear etiology. Hypercarbia would not be
wholly unexpected in this patient given his body habitus and his
CPAP requirement.  EEG results from [**3-7**] showed abnormal in
waking and sleeping states, with findings which can be seen with
mild encephalopathy, medication effect, or extreme drowsiness.
No focal abnormalities or epileptiform features.  MRI was unable
to be performed as patient was too large for scanner.  Patient
was treated empirically for meningitis but LP was attempted
multiple times and unsuccessful due to patient's body habitus.
Repeat CT scan to look for cerebral edema or evidence of anoxic
brain injury was negative.  Extubated on [**3-12**], mental status
assessed and patient initially alert and able to follow commands
but non-verbal.  Did not appear appropriate after extubation
from mental status perspective, and was reintubated shortly
thereafter.  Repeat head CT from [**2124-3-14**] was negative.  The
patient self extubated on [**3-19**] in the morning with stable
respiratory function post-extubation.  At that time he was able
to follow complex commands post-extubation, talking and
responsive.  On [**3-21**] he had a new delirium with increased WBC,
diarrhea, and was treated empirically for C. Diff (initially
with flagyl, switched to PO Vanco due to increased diarrhea and
increased WBC count).  After being transferred to the floor the
patient was alert and oriented x2 initially.   He was found to
be somnolent on the morning after arrival to the floor after not
wearing his CPAP at night.  His ABG was not particularly
concerning (7.43/76/47), but his MS improved with 30 minutes of
CPAP, and no other abnormalities were found.  His mental status
continued to improve and he remained alert and oriented x3 for
the week prior to discharge.
.
# Respiratory failure:
The patient was intubated in order to protect airway in setting
of altered mental status. It was a difficult intubation using
fiberoptic scope for intubation.  He was diuresed aggressively
with lasix due to pulmonary edema (approx 30L over LOS).  He was
initially extubated on [**3-12**], however required reintubation with
awake fiberoptic by anesthesia later in the PM on [**3-12**] due to
worsening tachypnea despite BiPAP.  Mini-BAL performed [**3-13**] with
no growth on final culture. He was continued with ongoing
diuresis. He had infiltrates on chest x-ray concerning for
ventilator assocaited pneumonia (VAP) given tan colored sputum
and he was started on Vanco/Zosyn.  He self extubated on [**3-19**] in
the morning, with stable respiratory status post-extubation. He
is placed nightly on BiPAP prophylactically, and his ABG/VBG??????s
remained stable. He completed a 7 day course of vancomycin/zosyn
and had no further respiratory symptoms on the floor.
