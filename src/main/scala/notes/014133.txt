PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Temperature is 99.6,
pulse 70, blood pressure 119/43, respiratory rate 24, oxygen
saturation is 97% on room air.  General appearance:
Comfortable, alert.  HEENT:  Anicteric, moist mucous
membranes.  Neck:  No LAD, no jugular venous distention.
Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally.  Heart:
Regular, rate, and rhythm, there is a 3/6 systolic ejection
murmur.  Abdomen is nondistended, soft, mild epigastric and
right lower quadrant tenderness.  There is no guarding or
rebound tenderness.  No [**Doctor Last Name 515**] sign.  Rectal is guaiac
positive.  Extremities:  No edema.  Dorsalis pedis are

INR is 4.0, PT 24, PTT 38.9.  Chem-7 is unremarkable with a
BUN of 31 and creatinine of 1.0.  Amylase 67, lipase 29, ALT
30, AST 45, alkaline phosphatase 96, and bilirubin 1.0.

Electrocardiogram showed A-V paced at 70 and no changes from
a previous electrocardiogram on [**2186-11-15**].  An abdominal CT
scan was obtained which revealed lung bases clear.  Calcified
coronaries.  Liver, spleen, and pancreas were within normal
limits.  No free air fluid levels.  There is a large
calcified 2 cm abscess-like structure in the right lower
quadrant with stranding, which is consistent with
appendicitis.

BRIEF HOSPITAL COURSE:  Mrs. [**Last Name (STitle) 23936**] is a 74-year-old woman
with a history of atrial fibrillation, cardiomyopathy with an
ejection fraction of 20%, status post A-V junctional
ablation, and pacer placement who presents with abdominal
pain and is found to have appendicitis.

Appendicitis:  The patient was admitted with question either
right lower quadrant abscess or perforated appendicitis.
Percutaneous drainage was placed and patient was started on
intravenous antibiotics which are ampicillin, ceftriaxone,
and Flagyl.

Patient continued to do well and the percutaneous drainage
was removed on [**1-6**].  Patient was initially kept NPO.
She was then allowed to take clear liquids.  Her diet was
advanced without problems, and she was able to tolerate
solids.

Cultures from the abscess were obtained, and were found to be
Enterococcus and sensitive, so the IV antibiotics were
stopped, and she was switched on levofloxacin and Flagyl
which are to be continued for three weeks.

Interventricular pacing during her hospital stay, it became
evident that the pacer was not always pacing.  EP were
consulted.  They followed the patient closely throughout the
hospital stay.  They interrogated the pacer and changed the
settings.  They found that one of the leads was not
appropriately working, however, deemed more appropriate to
take the patient back for de-lead revision as outpatient when
she will be rehabilitated and will have completed the course
of antibiotics.

Systolic congestive heart failure:  During her hospital stay,
the patient became dyspneic and developed lower extremity
edema.  It was found to be due to systolic congestive heart
failure.  Patient was transferred to the SICU.  The
congestive heart failure team was consulted.  She was started
on Natrecor, and was then transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 196**] team.

Patient was continued on Natrecor for four days with
excellent diuresis.  Natrecor was stopped after four days,
and she was switched back to her outpatient diuretics which
are Lasix 20 mg po q day and aldactone 100 mg po q day.  At
the time of discharge, the patient was at her baseline.  Her
oxygen saturation was 96% on room air and her legs were no
longer edematous.

Gout flare:  After diuresis, the patient developed a gout
flare in the arch of her right foot.  The patient needed to
recognize the symptoms of a gout flare.  The patient
initially complained of pain in the arch of the right foot
after one day.  The right foot arch was indeed erythematous
and swollen, and there was also involvement of the great
first toe.  The patient was started on colchicine with
improvement of the pain, but no change in the erythema or
swelling.  Rheumatology was consulted.

DISPOSITION:  The patient was evaluated by Physical Therapy,
who found her safe to be discharged home.  She was discharged
to a rehabilitation facility.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  To rehabilitation facility.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Good.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1. Spironolactone 100 mg po q day.
2. Furosemide 20 mg po q day.
3. Colchicine 0.6 mg po q day.
4. Warfarin 0.5 mg every other day estimated to 1.0 mg every
other day.
5. Flagyl 500 mg po tid.
6. Levofloxacin 500 mg po q day.
7. Digoxin 0.125 po q day.

9. Adderall 2 mg po q day.

FOLLOWUP:  The patient will follow up with EP on [**2187-1-25**] at 1 pm.  The patient will need an abdominal CT scan in
two weeks, and she will need follow-up appointment with her
cardiologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in two weeks.
