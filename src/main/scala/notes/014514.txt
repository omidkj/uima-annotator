Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2297**]
Chief Complaint:
Cough / shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
Dr [**Known lastname 3314**] is an 83 year old [**Hospital1 18**] surgeon, on disability
since [**Month (only) 116**] with a diagnosis of multiple myeloma. He presents
today with worsening O2 sats both at rest and exertion (he keeps
an O2 sat monitor at home), worsening cough, and increasing
shortness of breath.
.
Although he has not felt altogether well for the past six
months, he had been feeling better since his original admission
in [**2194-4-1**], for community-acquired pneumonia, in which he was
diagnosed with MM. Prior to that [**Month (only) 116**] admission he had also been
having worsening cough, SOB and DOE.
.
Three or four weeks ago by his account, he began having cough
again, although a CXR was negative for pulmonary process. But
over the last 24-48 hours, the cough "blossomed" and he also
became much more short of breath. He notes that before he would
have O2 sats at 90-92 after getting up and walking now they were
86-88, and he was much more uncomfortable. He was having
low-grade fevers. He came to the [**Hospital1 18**] and is now admitted for
diagnosis and management.
.
Per heme/onc fellow:
"HEMATOLOGIC HISTORY: Dr. [**Known lastname 3314**] was diagnosed in [**4-7**] when
he presented with a multilobar PNA and worsening renal function
and was found to have serum monoclonal IgA of 2.8 gm. His renal
fxn has generally been stable since admission (creat 2.6->2.1->
2.4). A UPEP showed intact IgA kappa and no bence [**Doctor Last Name 49**]
proteins. Anemia is mild and no hypercalceia. His skeletal
survey did not show lytic lesion but no fx or impending fx.
Beta-2 Microglobulin was elevated but hard to interpret in face
of renal insufficiency. IgG level 200 and IgM slightly
suppressed.
.
"He was initially treated with Decadron alone and then with
Decadron and Thalidomide, however, this was stopped in the
setting of disequilibrium and peripheral edema.  The peripheral
edema was ultimately thought to be related to some right-sided
heart failure and he was thought to be hypervolemic. He was then
started on Revlimid and pulse Decadron in [**6-7**]."

Past Medical History:

[**2194-7-15**] CT head: IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial

hypertrophy with mild global hypokinesis. Right ventricular
dilation and dysfunction. At least moderate pulmonary
hypertension. Moderate tricuspid regurgitation. Dilated thoracic
aorta.
.
[**2194-7-16**] EEG:
IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal portable EEG due to the presence
of
sharply contoured waveforms seen bifrontally and more often with
a
rightsided predominance in the setting of a slow and
disorganized
background rhythm. The significance of the first finding is not
entirely clear as there were no frank epileptiform discharges
seen. The
second finding is consistent with a moderate encephalopathy
suggesting
the presence of deeper midline dysfunction. Medication,
metabolic
disturbances, infections, or anoxia are among the most common
causes but
there are others. There were no clearly epileptiform discharges
noted.
No electrographic seizure activity was seen.


Brief Hospital Course:
Dr. [**Known lastname 3314**] is an 83 yo [**Hospital1 18**] surgeon with h/o Multiple
Myeloma s/p decadron/revlimid therapy, COPD, CHF, afib on
coumadin, who initially presented on [**7-12**] with fatigue, low
grade fever, and increased productive cough from his baseline.
He noted decreased 02 saturations at home on his pulse ox with
increased DOE (92% -> 88%). He had previously been treated for
CAP indergoing a hospital stay. He denied any chest pain,
pleurisy, orthopnea, n/v/d, or increased LE swelling during that
time. Moreover, he had recently finished a decadron taper for
his MM.
In the ED, he was found to have a RML infiltrate on CXR.
Cultures were obtained and the patient was started on
Ceftriaxone. He was subsequently transferred to the BMT service
for further care.
.
On the BMT service, his Ceftriaxone was continued, and was
started on Vancomycin on [**7-14**] for [**1-5**] + blood cultures for coag
neg Staph. Additionally, he was given IVIG on [**7-14**] for his MM,
which he tolerated well.
.
On the morning of transfer, the patient was found unresponsive
in his room at 7AM with blood coming from mouth. Code team was
activated. Patient was found to be in asystolic arrest. CPR was
initiated and the patient was intubated. He received epi 1mg x3,
atropine 1mg x1 where he regained pulse. ABG was 7.04/49/252.
.
He then presented to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] after suffering cardiac arrest in
the setting of RML PNA and Staph bacteremia.  [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] course by
problem is as follows:
.
# Cardiac Arrest: Patient was found to be unresponsive for an
unclear duration (most likely < 10 minutes as the
