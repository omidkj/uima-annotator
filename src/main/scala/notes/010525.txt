[**2122-3-23**] Carotid Ultrasound
Normal carotid study

[**2122-3-24**] ECHO
The atria are moderately dilated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There is moderate to
severe global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 30%). The
right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with mild global free
wall hypokinesis. The aortic arch is mildly dilated. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is
not present. Mild to moderate ([**12-10**]+) aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. A
slightly-eccentric, posteriorly-directed jet of moderate to
severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Moderate to severe
[3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Moderate-to-severe global left ventricular systolic
dysfunction. Mild right ventricular systolic dysfunction.
Mild-moderate aortic regurgitation. Moderate-to-severe mitral
regurgitation. Moderate-to-severe tricuspid regurgitation. Mild
pulmonary hypertension.

[**2122-3-25**] ECHO
Pre Bypass: The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right
atrium is moderately dilated. The left ventricular cavity size
is top normal/borderline dilated. There is severe regional left
ventricular systolic dysfunction septal dyskinesis. There is
moderate to severe hypokinesis of the remaining segments (LVEF =
20 %). The right ventricular cavity is moderately dilated with
moderate global free wall hypokinesis. There are simple atheroma
in the aortic arch. There are simple atheroma in the descending
thoracic aorta. There are three aortic valve leaflets. There is
no aortic valve stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The mitral valve
leaflets are myxomatous. Moderate or worse ([**1-11**]+) dynamic mitral
regurgitation is seen. The jet is central and worsens with
provactive manuvers (tberg, phenylepherine, increasing sbp > 140
mm Hg). The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There
is a small pericardial effusion and pericardial calcifications
are noted.

Post Bypass: Patient is atrially paced on milranone, epi , and
phenylepherine gtt. There is an annuloplasty ring in the mitral
position without regrugitatant flow. Peak gradient< 5 mm Hg with
no regurgitatio or perivavluar flow. There is an annuloplasty
ring in the tricuspid position with no regurgitation, peak
gradient 2-3 mm Hg, and no perivavluar flow. There is unchanged
biventricular function, LVEF 20-25% with septal dyskinesis.
Aortic contours remain intact. AI remains trace. Remaining exam
is unchanged. All findings discussed with surgeons at the time
of the exam.

[**2122-3-30**] CTA Chest/Abdomen
1. Post-surgical changes in the chest status post valve
replacement with a small amount of residual pneumomediastinum.
Two surgical drains in the anterior mediastinum. Moderate
pericardial effusion, likely hemorrhagic. Markedly enlarged
heart with marked dilatation of the right atrium.
2. Small right and moderate left pleural effusion with
compressive atelectasis.
3. No intra-abdominal or intrapelvic abscesses or fluid
collection or obstruction.
4. Post-surgical change in the liver status post partial
hepatectomy. Mild periportal fluid tracking. Mild dilatation of
the main pancreatic duct of uncertain significance.


Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2122-3-23**] for surgical
management of her mitral and tricuspid valve disease. Heparin
was started as she had been off her coumadin for several days
prior to addmission. She was worked-up in the usual preoperative
manner including a carotid duplex ultrasound which revealed
normal carotid arteries. Given her past history of a partial
liver resection, the liver service was consulted. No increased
risk was identified from a liver standpoint and she was cleared
for surgery. On [**2122-3-25**], Ms. [**Known lastname **] was taken to the operating
room where she underwent a mitral and tricuspid valve repair.
Postoperatively she was taken to the intensive care unit for
monitoring. Pressors and inotropes were weaned very slowly. She
bled postoperatively which required transfusions with packed red
blood cells and fresh frozen plasma. Her bleeding gradually
slowed and stopped. Late on postoperative day one, she awoke
neurologically intact and was extubated. She was noted to be
thrombocytopenic and a HIT assay was sent which was negative. A
left chest tube was placed for a large pleural effusion. An echo
revealed no significant pericardial effusion. On [**2122-4-1**], Ms.
[**Known lastname **] was transferred to the step down unit for further
recovery. She was diuresed towards her preoperative weight. The
physical therapy service was consulted for assistance with her
postoperative strength and mobility. She was cleared for
discharge to rehab on POD #9. Pt. is to make all follow up
appts. as per discharge instructions.
