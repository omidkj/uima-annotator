HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Patient is a 63-year-old male
with a history of hyperlipidemia, who developed sudden onset
of sharp substernal chest pain [**8-30**] at 8 p.m.  Pain radiated
to the jaw, but not to the back or extremities.  Patient
attempted to relieve the pain with over-the-counter NSAIDs
with no relief.  Patient does report diaphoresis, no nausea,
or vomiting.  No PND.  No orthopnea, no dyspnea on exertion.

Patient was transported to an outside hospital, and an EKG
showed 1-[**Street Address(2) 1766**] elevations in II, III, aVF in leads V4
through V6 with an initial CK of 145.  The patient was
transferred to [**Hospital1 **] Catheterization Laboratory, where it was
revealed that he had a lesion 100% occluded most likely old
in the RCA, and a new 100% LCX lesion plus 80% LAD lesion.
The RCA and left circumflex received Cypher stents, cardiac
index of 4.03 with a wedge pressure of 28.  Patient had an
episode of hypotension in the Catheterization Laboratory
requiring dopamine and Neo-Synephrine.  There is concern
about allergic reaction to the dye, and the patient was given
Solu-Medrol and Pepcid in the laboratory.  The patient was
transferred to the CCU off pressors and stable.

HOME MEDICATIONS:  Lipitor 10.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Negative.  Cardiac review of systems is
positive for chest pain, diaphoresis.  Denies dyspnea on
exertion, PND, orthopnea, shortness of breath, edema,
palpitations, syncope, presyncope.

PREVIOUS MEDICAL HISTORY:  Hypercholesterolemia.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Patient is a school custodian.  He is still
working.  He is married.  He has no children.  He has a
tobacco history, although no longer smokes.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Patient has a noncontributory family
history.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Heart rate 89, blood
pressure 150/87.  In general, patient is comfortable in no
acute distress.  Mucous membranes are moist.  ENT is within
normal limits.  No JVD.  No thyroid nodules are palpated.
Respiratory:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Cardiovascular examination:  Rate is regular, normal S1, S2,
no S3, S4, no murmurs.  Abdominal examination:  Soft,
nontender, nondistended, positive bowel sounds.  Extremities:
No edema, 2+ posterior tibial pulses and no edema on
extremities.  Patient has a right groin hematoma.  Skin:
Patient has a rash over the chest.

EKG on admission:  Sinus, 84, normal axis, normal intervals,
left atrial abnormality, 1-[**Street Address(2) 15827**] elevations in II, III,
aVF, V4 through V6.  Post catheterization, patient has sinus
rhythm, normal axis, normal intervals, Q waves in aVF and
III.

Cardiac catheterization showed LAD with 80% mid lesion of the
diag bifurcation.  RCA with 100% proximal occlusion.  Left
circumflex with 100% mid occlusion.  Cypher stent 3 x 3 in
the RCA, Cypher 2.5 x 18 in the left circumflex, and
additional 3 x 8.  Hemodynamics:  Cardiac output 7.82.
Cardiac index 4.03.  Right atrial 12.  RV 37/9.  PA pressure
40/24.  Wedge pressure 28.

LABORATORIES ON ADMISSION:  White count 12, 82% segs, 11%
lymphocytes, 4 monocytes, and 1 eosinophil.  Hematocrit 33.2,
platelets 212.  Electrolytes:  145, 3.4, 110, 28, 22, 135,
magnesium 1.8.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  This is a 63-year-old male with a
history of hyperlipidemia transferred to [**Hospital3 **] for
emergent catheterization that revealed 100% stenosis and
occlusion of the RCA and left circumflex lesions successfully
stented.  The patient experienced hypotensive reaction to dye
during catheterization procedure.  Was quickly resuscitated
with fluids and pressors.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. Cardiovascular:  A. Coronary artery disease:  Patient was
maintained on Integrilin for 18 hours, placed on aspirin for
life, and Plavix for nine months.  Patient had a beta blocker
which was titrated up as well as an addition of an ACE
inhibitor.  CKs were cycled and peaked at 4,869.  CK MB
peaked at 468 on [**2191-2-20**].

Patient had an 80% stenosis of the LAD which was left
untreated during this admission.  The patient received
cardiac rehab with a nutrition consult with Physical Therapy.
A hemoglobin A1C was checked and found to be 5.7.  Patient
initially had elevated blood glucoses that returned to [**Location 213**]
levels prior to his discharge.

B. Pump:  Patient had an echocardiogram in [**2191-2-21**], which
demonstrated a left ventricular ejection fraction of 45%,
left ventricular systolic function was mildly depressed with
inferior hypokinesis to akinesis.  Patient was maintained on
a beta blocker, which was titrated up as well as an ACE
inhibitor.

C. Rhythm:  Patient experienced some nonsustained V-tach on
telemetry, which resolved post MI.  Forty-eight hours the
patient was transferred to the floor and maintained on
telemetry until discharge.  Patient was scheduled for an
outpatient exercise stress test [**2191-3-23**] for further
evaluation of his LAD lesion as well as followup with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] for further plans to treat this LAD lesion.

2. Renal:  Patient's creatinine was stable throughout this
admission.

3. FEN and GI:  Patient had a normal hemoglobin A1C, mildly
elevated blood glucoses that returned to [**Location 213**] prior to his
discharge.

4. Heme:  Patient had a large hematoma, but maintained stable
hematocrit throughout the admission.

5. Allergy:  Patient has a new documented allergy to contract
dye.

On discharge, patient underwent Physical Therapy and
nutrition counseling for cardiac diet.  Patient was given a
letter to excuse him from work by attending.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Acute myocardial infarction status post catheterization
and stent placement x2.
2. Hypotensive reaction to contact dye.
3. Congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of 45.
4. Coronary artery disease.

FOLLOWUP:
1. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 13248**], [**2191-3-3**] at 11 a.m. for referral for a stress
test.
2. Exercise stress [**2191-3-23**] [**Hospital Ward Name 23**] [**Location (un) **].
3. Cardiology followup with [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], [**Telephone/Fax (1) 4022**].

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Patient was walking well, working with
Physical Therapy, taking p.o., and educated on a cardiac
diet, on a statin with stable hemodynamics.

POST DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1. Aspirin 325.
2. Plavix 75.
3. Tylenol and docusate prn.
4. Senna prn.
5. Protonix.
6. Atorvastatin 20 q.d.
7. Lisinopril 2.5 q.d.
8. Toprol XL 100 q.d.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  The patient was discharged home.
