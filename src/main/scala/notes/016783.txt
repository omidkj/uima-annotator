Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 10842**]
Chief Complaint:
Failure to thrive

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:

History of Present Illness:
84 yo female with PMH significant for severe AS, diastolic CHF
with preserved EF(EF 45-50%), recent admission ([**Date range (1) 25773**]) for
ARF and transaminitis (unclear etiology, ?autoimmune), presents
with 2-3 days of malaise and decreased appetite. She reports
that for about a week after being discharged she was feeling
well with good appetite. Then over the past few days she has had
increasing general weakness, malaise, and decreased appetite.
She has been drinking some fluids but has not taken any food PO
over the past few days. Family members tried to encourage PO
intake, supplemental shakes, etc with little success. She
reports some associated nausea but no vomiting, only dry heaves.
Earlier today she was described as lethargic and confused and so
was brought to the ED.

In the ED, T 96.3  BP 133/50  HR 60  RR 17  SpO2 99% on RA. EKG
and CXR were normal. Stool was  heme positive but pt is taking
iron. Received IVF. On arrival to the floor, pt reports that she
feels better than when she initially presented to the ED though
still feels weak.

Studies:
[**9-11**] Abd CT:
IMPRESSION:
1.  No evidence of any retroperitoneal bleed.
2.  Markedly distended stomach, both small and large bowel are
decompressed.
3.  Mild bilateral pleural effusions and associated atelectasis.

4.  Ascites.
5.  Unchanged duplication cyst in right lower quadrant.
6.  Free fluid in the pelvis.
7.  Fluid containing right inguinal hernia.

[**9-15**] LENIs:
IMPRESSION:  Limited evaluation of the superficial femoral veins
bilaterally due to leg edema.  Otherwise, no evidence of deep
venous thrombosis in either extremity.

[**9-16**] CXR:
The ET tube has been slightly repositioned with its tip now 11
mm above the carina, still low.  Mild overinflation of the ET
tube cuff is seen.
There is no significant change in the cardiac silhouette.
Severe
calcifications of the mitral valve are again noted.  New since
[**9-13**], rounded opacity projecting over the right mid and
lower lung are demonstrated and given the fast development,
infectious in origin.  Bilateral pleural effusions are again
noted, small-to-moderate and may partially loculated on the
right.


Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 10446**] is an 84yo female with a history of aortic stenosis
and CHF who presented on [**2185-9-7**] failure to thrive, nausea, and
vomiting. Her brief hospital course by problem is as follows:

#)GI Bleed: Pt was found to have melanotic stools on the floor
and her Hct dropped from 33 to 22, so she was transfered to the
MICU where she received 7u PRBCs. Upper endoscopy on [**9-12**]
revealed multiple non-bleeding ulcers in the whole stomach and a
bleeding Dieualfoy lesion in the duodenum which was clipped and
injected with epinephrine. Due to concern for continued
bleeding, she then underwent repeat endoscopy on [**9-13**] which
showed persistent bleeding of one of her ulcers; successful
hemostasis was acheived with clipping. AFter 2 days of
observation and stable hematocrits, she was transferred to the
floor. On the night of transfer, she developed large BRBPR
admixed with clots, but remained hemodynamically stable. Her BPs
remained >100 systolic. She was tachycardiac to the 100s-110s
and her Hct dropped from 29.0 to 20.2. She was transfered back
to the MICU, transfused and underwent IR guided embolization. In
total, she received 20u PRBC, 13u FFP, and 4u platelets. Since
coming to the floor on [**9-20**], her Hct has been stable and her
pressures have been adequate. She has had several small
melanotic stools (which is expected as per GI) and has remained
hemodynamically stable. Pt was sent home on a PPI [**Hospital1 **].
** Pt was not sent home on aspirin given her recent massive
bleed; this can be restarted as an outpatient as appropriate.

#) Pneumonia: During her first MICU stay, the pt was intubated
and subsequently developed respiratory symptoms consistent w/
hospital-acquired pneumonia. She was started on Vanc/Cefepime
for an 8-day course, and when sputum cultures revealed MSSA and
1+ budding yeast, she was transitioned to nafcillin and
completed the course in-house. At discharge, she was without
respiratory symptoms and had adequate O2 sats on RA.

#) Volume overload: Pt developed volume overload evidenced by
[**3-13**]+ pitting edema in both lower extremities up to her thighs
and in both upper extremities. This was in the setting of her
mild CHF (EF 45-50%) and numerous transfusions. When she came to
the floor, pt was started on Lasix 20mg IV BID and was nearly 2L
negative for 2 days. She began to improve clinically and was
transitioned back to her home regimen of Lasix PO 40mg daily. At
discharge, her edema had improved and will likely continue to
improve on her home regimen.
**Pt was not restarted on her home spironolactone as she was
diuresing well on lasix; spironolactone can be restarted as an
outpatient as appropriate.
**Pt was also not sent home on her usual metoprolol regimen, as
her pressures were low-normal during the diuresis and we did not
want to tip h
