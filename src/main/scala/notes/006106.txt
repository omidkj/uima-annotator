HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 44 year old
gentleman with known mitral valve prolapse who has been
having symptoms of racing heartbeat.  Recent echocardiogram
showed dilated left atrium, severely dilated left ventricle
and ejection fraction of 60 percent, 4+ mitral regurgitation,
partial mitral leaflet flail.  Preoperative cardiac
catheterization showed pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension, elevated left filling pressure, ejection
fraction 60 percent, no significant coronary artery disease.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Hypertension.  Mitral regurg.  Status
post hernia repair.  Status post ear surgery.  Status post
dental surgery.  Status post tonsillectomy.

ALLERGIES:  Penicillin causes tongue swelling.  Sulfa drugs
cause a rash.

MEDICATIONS:
Preoperative medications included lisinopril 5 mg p.o. q.day.

HO[**Last Name (STitle) **] COURSE:  The patient was admitted to [**Hospital1 346**] on [**2101-2-1**], for minimally
invasive mitral valve replacement with a 31 mm Mosaic porcine
pericardial valve with Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) **].  Please see operative
note for further details.  The patient was transported to the
intensive care unit on Neo-Synephrine and propofol infusion.
The patient was noted to be in sinus rhythm initially
postoperatively, however, several hours postoperatively the
patient went into a junctional rhythm with a decrease in
blood pressure.  The patient was started on dopamine infusion
with an increase in heart rate without return of sinus
rhythm.  The patient was weaned and extubated from mechanical
ventilation on his first postoperative day.  On postoperative
day one the patient was still in a junctional rhythm.
Dopamine infusion was discontinued.  The patient's heart rate
dropped from 80s in junctional rhythm to 70s in junctional
rhythm with adequate systolic blood pressure and
hemodynamically stable.

The patient was started on Toradol for pain relief.  The
patient's chest tube was removed without incident.  On
postoperative day two the patient continued to be in a
junctional rhythm, hemodynamically stable.  An
electrophysiology consult was obtained.  It was felt that
this was due to sinus node dysfunction possibly from edema.
Recommended just following the patient as long as the patient
was asymptomatic.  The patient was transferred from the
intensive care unit to the regular part of the hospital on
postoperative day three.  He began ambulating in the hallway.
He was weaned off oxygen.  On postoperative day three the
patient worked with physical therapy and was able to ambulate
500 feet without difficulty, continuing in a junctional
rhythm.  However, by postoperative day four the patient's
sinus rhythm had returned.

Th[**Last Name (STitle) 1050**] was seen by electrophysiology on day five and
they felt the patient was cleared for discharge to home, no
need for pacemaker at this time.  However, they recommended [**Initials (NamePattern4) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] of Hearts monitor for two weeks to insure the patient
remained in sinus rhythm.  Per Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) **], the patient
was started empirically on Coumadin for anticoagulation for
the junctional rhythm.  On postoperative day six the patient
was cleared for discharge to home.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  T-max 100, pulse 88 in sinus rhythm,
blood pressure 120/60, respiratory rate 16, room air oxygen
saturation 95 percent.  The patient's weight on [**2-7**]
was 95 kg.  The patient was 88 kg preoperatively.  The
patient is awake, alert and oriented times three, nonfocal.
Heart regular rate and rhythm without rub or murmur.  Breath
sounds are clear bilaterally.  Abdomen positive bowel sounds,
soft, nondistended, nontender.  Sternal incision is clean,
dry and intact.  There is no erythema or drainage.  Chest
x-ray on [**2-7**] showed right lower lobe atelectasis, no
pneumothorax and no effusion.  The patient has no peripheral
edema.

Laboratory data included white blood cell count 13.2,
hematocrit 25.2, platelet count 426.  All of these three lab
values were elevated from the patient's CBC on [**2-6**]
which were 10.6 for white count, hematocrit 21.3, platelet
count 277.  This was felt to be due to hemoconcentration.
Sodium 138, potassium 4.9, chloride 98, bicarb 32, BUN 12,
creatinine 0.9, glucose 114.  PT 12.8, PTT 21.3, INR 1.1.

The patient is to be discharged to home in stable condition.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Enteric coated aspirin 81 mg p.o. q.day.
2.  Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d.
3.  Vitamin C 500 mg p.o. b.i.d.
4.  Niferex 150 mg p.o. q.day.
5.  Percocet 5/325 one to two tabs p.o. q.four to six hours
p.r.n.
6.  Ambien 5 mg p.o. q.h.s. p.r.n.
7.  Lasix 20 mg p.o. q.day times seven days.
8.  Potassium chloride 20 mEq p.o. q.day times seven days.
9.  Multivitamin one p.o. q.day.
10. Coumadin 5 mg on [**2-7**], 5 mg on [**2-8**].
Visiting nurse is to draw PT/INR on [**2-9**] and call the
results to Dr.[**Name (NI) 46584**] office.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4127**] will
interpret the results and adjust Coumadin dosing for goal INR
of 2.0.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Mitral regurgitation.
2.  Status post minimally invasive mitral valve replacement.
3.  Postoperative junctional rhythm, now resolved.

FO[**Last Name (STitle) **]:  The patient is to follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4127**] by
phone on [**2-9**] for Coumadin dosing.  He is to follow up
with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4127**] in the office in one to two weeks.  The
patient is to follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in one to two weeks.
The patient is to follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] in three to
four weeks.  The patient is to be discharged with [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] of
Hearts monitor with results for two weeks to be sent to Dr.
[**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].
