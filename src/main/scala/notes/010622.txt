Brief Hospital Course:
She was admitted to the Trauma service. Her lip laceration was
sutured by Plastic surgery in the ED. Neurosurgery was consulted
for disc bulging at level of C3,4 and an MRI was recommended,
she was kept in a hard collar until final [**Location (un) 1131**] of the MRI.
Final [**Location (un) 1131**] revealed large central disc herniation at C4-5
level resulting in moderate-to- severe spinal stenosis and
extrinsic indentation on the spinal cord; mild-to-moderate
spinal stenosis due to small disc herniation at C3-4
level; no abnormal signal within the spinal cord and multilevel
degenerative changes at other levels. The collar was then
removed and no further neurosurgery follow up is being
recommended at this time. The patient will however be given the
name and number of Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 548**], Neurosurgery if she has any
concerns regarding her cervical spine after [**Last Name (STitle) **].

She was noted with a hypotensive and bradycardic episode while
on the regular nursing unit triggering a transfer to the trauma
ICU. She was given IVF bolus and started on a Levophed drip. She
was eventually weaned off, adjustments in her cardiac meds were
made and she was transferred back to the regular nursing unit.

She was evaluated by Cardiology because of concerns that motor
vehicle crash was related to syncopal episode. She was ruled out
for MI with serial CK's and troponin and underwent ECHO and TTE.
 Her ECHO revealed the left atrium mildly dilated; moderate
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with left ventricular
cavity size normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function
is normal (LVEF 70%). Right ventricular chamber size and free
wall motion are normal. Aortic valve leaflets are moderately
thickened. There is critical aortic valve stenosis (valve area
<0.8cm2). The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There
is no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is
seen. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is
normal. There is no pericardial effusion. The carotid series
revealed <40% right ICA and left ICA stenosis. Several
recommendations were made for continuing the beta blockade for
her atrial fibrillation and anticoagulation with Coumadin for
thromboembolic prophylaxis. She received Coumadin 2.5 mg on
[**11-14**], her INR on [**11-15**] was 2.6. She will need to follow up with
her primary cardiologist Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] at [**Hospital 1411**] Medical after
[**Hospital **] from hospital.

Cardiac surgery was consulted for AVR given the critical AS, it
was discussed with patient and her son to that surgery was
indicated. The patient at this time has declined any surgical
intervention.

Physical and Occupational therapy were consulted and have
recommended rehab after her acute hospital stay.
