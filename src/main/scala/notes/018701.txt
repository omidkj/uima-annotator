History of Present Illness:
Pt is an 82 yo F with a R hip fracture in [**6-27**] s/p failed ORIF
c/b LE DVT now on coumadin who presents with anemia noted on
routine lab draws and guaiac positive brown stool.  Pt's fall
and surgery occured in FL where she lived; she moved to [**Location (un) 86**]
after the surgery failed for further medical care and to be
closer to her [**Location (un) 802**].
.
Pt reports constipation when she was in FL, but she relates this
to her percoset use post-op.  Pt had several days of n/v/d one
week prior to admission, which pt relates to "food poisoning"
which has now resolved.  In general over past several months, pt
denies change in weight, change in bowel movements, n/v/d,
melena, bloody stool, abdominal pain, bloating, vaginal
bleeding, tea colored urine or pale stool.  She has never had a
colonoscopy; her last mamogram was years ago.
.
Over the past month pt's Hct has trended 32->26->24. At [**Location (un) **]
on the day of admission, her INR was >5, so she received 5 mg PO
vitamin K and was transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED.
.
In the ED, she was hemodynamically stable: 97.3, 82, 109/45,
18,97% RA.
.
On the floor, she has no complaints. She denies CP, SOB,
palpitations, abdominal pain, dysuria, fever, night sweats,
fatigue, poor energy, or any other symptoms.

Past Medical History:
Dementia
Hyperchol
R hip fx s/p ORIF [**6-27**] in FL, c/b post-op DVT, on coumadin. Seen
here by ortho, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1005**], with planned repair and ?IVC prior
to surgery
"murmur"
"mild CHF"


Social History:
Pt lived in FL, now moved to [**Hospital1 **] Home for the Aged, an
[**Hospital3 **] facility.  She normally walks with a cane, but
has been bedbound due to her non-healed ORIF. She has a 40
pack-year smoking history but quit 20 years ago. She denies ETOH
or drug use. Her [**Last Name (LF) 802**], [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) 80291**] is her HCP [**Telephone/Fax (1) 80292**].

.
At discharge::
97.8 / (129/61)  /  84  /  97% on room air
-I/VI holosystolic murmur
-lungs clear bilaterally, poor effort, distant
-abdomen obese, soft, nontender
-scar on right hip with staples, minimal erythema, overlying
sheets stained with yellow serous fluid
-legs are obese and symmetrically large. unclear how much of leg
distension is a result of fluid overload vs obesity. non
pitting.

=====================
CXR ([**9-23**]): improving retrocardiac density and small left
effusion.
=====================
Distal sigmoid, biopsy: Adenocarcinoma
=====================
Cardiac ECHO: Normal global and regional biventricular systolic
function. Moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. Mild
aortic stenosis.
=====================
CT of chest abdomen pelvis:
1. Thickening of the mid segment of the sigmoid colon with no
proximal
obstruction is compatible with the patient's known sigmoid
cancer.
2. 7-mm right lower lobe pulmonary nodule. Considerations
include
metastatic focus or inflammatory/infectious process. FDG- PET
can be obtained for further evaluation but lesion is borderline
in size for detection by FDG-PET. Pulmonary edema and
atelectasis limits evaluation for pulmonary nodules; dedicated
repeat chest CT could be obtained after optimization of
pulmonary status for better assessment.
2. Colonic diverticulosis with no evidence of diverticulitis.
3. Cholelithiasis. Dilated CBD and possible focal pancreatic
ductal
dilation (vs small pancreatic cystic lesion). MRCP could be
obtained for
further evaluation.
4. Relative enlargement of the right ovary which is unusual for
the patient's age. This can be further evaluated by pelvic
ultrasound.
5. Large axial hiatal hernia.
6. Bilateraly hypodense renal lesions, too small to
characterize, and 31-mm right renal lesion possibly representing
a hyperdense cyst but indeterminate.
MR of the abdomen can be obtained for further characterization.
9. Chronic fracture of the right femoral neck which is
associated with
displacement of the femoral neck and head fracture fragments,
not in
contact with the dynamic hip screw.


Brief Hospital Course:
82 yo F with hx of CHF, dementia and hip fx s/p ORIF on Coumadin
presented with asymptomatic anemia and supratherpeutic INR,
found to have 6 cm fungating mass in sigmoid colon on
colonoscopy. Pt underwent substantial surgery of the right hip
(description attached). Surgical and medical oncology agreed
that the pt must recover functional status (ie be able to walk)
in order to be a candidate for surgical resection of her colonic
mass and subsequent chemotherapy. Repeat LENIS sowed no remaing
DVT. Coumadin was discontinued and the pt was stater on lovenox
(prophylactic dose) prior to discharge. Hospital course by
problem:
.
# Anemia: Pt's HCT was in the 30s 1 mo ago; on admission, HCT
was 23 and dropped to 21 with guaiac positive stool but no frank
blood in stool. EGD was performed which showed large hiatal
hernia but no source of bleed. Colonoscopy was performed, which
showed a 6 cm fungating mass in the sigmoid colon which was the
likely source of the pt's anemia. Pt was also found to be iron
deficient and she was started on supplemental iron. B12 was WNL.
Pt's Hct in 30-31 range and stable on day of discharge.
Reccommened checking CBC at least twice per week or more often
if grossly bloody bowel movements present.
.
# Colon Cancer: Adenocarcinoma by biopsy. General surgery and
oncology were consulted.  Per oncology, pt is unable to receive
chemotherapy until she can walk. chemo should be done approx 1
mo after surgery. Pt has follow-up with surgical oncology
scheduled.
==CT chest/abdomen/pelvis was done for staging.
--7mm RLL nodule noted; FDG-PET can be obtained for further
evaluation.
