Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 290**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of Breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation

History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 74 yo woman with h/o COPD, diastolic CHF (EF >
55%), OSA, who presents with worsening SOB.  Ms. [**Known lastname **] states
that she was in her normal state of health until this past
Monday, when she developed diarrhea, shortness of breath and a
cough productive of yellow sputum.  She used her albuterol
nebulizer approximately four times on Monday and Tuesday, and it
minimally improved her symptoms.  Yesterday morning, she felt
significantly more short of breath and developed a coughing fit
around noon.  She called EMS and was brought to the ED for
further evaluation.
.
Of note, Ms. [**Known lastname **] was recently admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] from [**2-13**] to
[**2-21**] with a COPD exacerbation.  During that hospitalization, she
remained in the MICU for 7 days, was placed on BiPap, and was
started on Levofloxacin.  She was discharged to a rehab
facility, where she remained until [**2154-3-16**].
.
In the ED, she was initially tachycardic to the 120s and was
satting 87% on 2L of O2 (her home dose).  She was initially
placed on a facemask and was given two nebulizations, Magnesium
IV, and Solumedrol.  This initially improved her symptoms;
however, she then became acutely agitated and had increasing
SOB.  Respiratory was called and she was placed on Bipap 40%.
She also had a CXR in the ED, which was concerning for a RLL
opacity.  She was thus started on Levofloxacin and CTX for CAP
and was admitted to the MICU for further evaluation.  Her VS at
the time of transfer were T 98.4, P 102, BP 107/87, R 25, O2 94%
on 40% Bipap.
.
On the floor, Ms. [**Known lastname **] states that her breathing has
substantially improved since starting the BiPap.  She denies
recent fevers or sick contacts and otherwise has no new
complaints.

Discharge labs:

EKG [**2154-3-20**]: Sinus tachycardia with probable ventricular
premature beats. Delayed R wave progression is non-specific.
Since the previous tracing of [**2154-2-21**] sinus tachycardia is now
present.

Imaging:
[**2154-3-20**] CXR:  AP portable upright chest radiograph is obtained.
The lungs are hyperinflated. A nodular opacity projects over the
right lung base which measures approximately 18 x 18 mm. This
nodular opacity was not seen on recent prior studies and the
possibility of a nipple shadow is raised. No definite sign of
pneumonia or CHF. Cardiomediastinal silhouette appears
stable. Atherosclerotic calcification along the thoracic aorta
noted. Bony
structures appear intact. Nodular opacity projecting over the
right lung base which may represent a nipple shadow, though
repeat is recommended with nipple markers to further assess.

TTE [**4-4**]: IMPRESSION: Early appearance of agitated saline
bubbles in the left atrium/ventricle after injection. This
findings is consistent with a patent foramen ovale/small ASD.
The fact that bubbles are seen to cross the interatrial septum
at rest suggests that right atrial pressures are elevated.
Dilated and depressed LV and RV with moderate to severe
pulmonary hypertension.

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient is a 74 yo woman with h/o COPD, diastolic CHF (EF >
55%), OSA, and anxiety, who presented from home with a three-day
history of shortness of breath, consistent with a COPD
exacerbation.

#. Hypoxemia:
Most likely COPD exacerbation. The patient was admitted to the
MICU and treated with intermittent BIPAP ventilation as well as
solumedrol 125 mg IV q8hr initially, with a transition to oral
steroids. Was also started on azithromycin. Patient's
respiratory status improved with these interventions as well as
nebulizer treatments. There was a question of pneumonia for
which the patient received a dose of vancomycin and cefepime
initially- these were soon d/c-ed when it became clear that an
infectious etiology of her SOB was unlikely. After initial
transfer to the floor she came back to the MICU with hypoxemia
and was again placed on BiPAP ventilation overnight. After two
days in the MICU the patient's pulmonary exam and hypoxemia had
significantly improved and she was again transferred to the
floor with plans for overnight home CPAP as well as a slow
steroid taper given rebound exacerbation. Though COPD
exacerbation is most likely cause for her hypoxemia, was noted
that she has a PFO and we will remain vigilant that this may be
alternate cause of her profound hypoxemia and rapid recovery.
Cardiology suggested an ECHO at time of next hypoxemic event to
rule out any significant R to L shunt as contributing to
hypoxemia. She again was transferred to the MICU due to hypoxia
and was subsequently intubated. She struggled with the
ventilator and required paralytics due to dysynchronous
breathing. After discussion with the family and resultant
multiorgan failure she was made CMO. She passed away on [**2154-4-6**]
at 5 AM.
.
#. Multiorgan failure:
Presented with elevated creatinine of 1.4 up from baseline of
0.7. Improved with fluid rehydration. She subsequently developed
renal failure again and became oliguric. Renal was consulted and
they did not want to do CVVH due to how critically ill she was.
She also developed elevated LFTs up to 10,000 and elevated
cardiac enzymes. She did not respond to fluids and pressors were
required. After family discussion pressors were discontinued.
.
# Elevated Ferritin: She developed an elevated ferritin and
D-Dimer which was thought to be due to possible HLH. She was
also noted to have elevated LFTs which could have also been a
result of hypotension and hypoxia.
.
#. DM2:
QID fingersticks were checked and ISS administered. She was
eventually placed on an insulin sliding scale.
.
Ms. [**Known lastname **] was made CMO and passed away on [**2154-4-6**] at 5 AM.
Family consented to autopsy.
