Brief Hospital Course:
Ms [**Known lastname 25288**] was transfer to [**Hospital1 18**] ED on [**2200-6-12**] from rehab for a
syncopal episode, and was found to be in rapid atrial
fibrillation with congestive heart failure.  While in the ED IV
lasix was given, Vancomycin 1 gm, Cefepime 2 gm and Levofloxacin
750 mg x 1 for possible pneumonia in setting of leukocytosis WBC
14.  CXR showed bilateral effusions. She was admitted to the
CVICU. An echocardiogram was done which showed aortic valve
prosthesis appears well seated, with normal leaflet/disc motion
and transvalvular gradients. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. No mitral regurgitation is seen.  There is a
very small pericardial effusion. She was diuresed with IV lasix.
Interrogation of her pacer demonstrates no mode switching events
and ventricular high rate episodes are only afew secondly long
and occur ~once a week, but she is known to have chronic atrial
fibrillation. Per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 914**] amiodarone was discontinuation and
increased beta-blockers. Her heart rate improved. She had
multiple stools, c.diff was negative x 3.  Infectious disease
was consulted and recommended a total of a 2 week course since
her symtpoms improved after treatment was inititated with flagyl
and vanco. Pradaxa was restarted for atrial fibrillation- No
coumadin per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 914**].  She has a low activity tolerance due
to deconditioning and post-op recovery. She was seen by physical
therapy and continued to make slow steady progress. She was
discharged back to [**Hospital3 4103**] on the [**Doctor Last Name **] on HD # 4.
