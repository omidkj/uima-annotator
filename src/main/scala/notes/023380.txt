INTERPRETATION:

Findings:

LEFT ATRIUM: Moderate LA enlargement. No thrombus in the LAA.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Normal RA size. Lipomatous
hypertrophy of the
interatrial septum. No ASD or PFO by 2D, color Doppler or saline
contrast with
maneuvers.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thickness. Normal LV cavity size.
Mild regional
LV systolic dysfunction. Mildly depressed LVEF.

LV WALL MOTION: Regional LV wall motion abnormalities include:
mid anterior -
normal; anterior apex - hypo; apex - hypo; remaining LV segments
contract
normally.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTA: Normal aortic diameter at the sinus level. Normal
ascending aorta
diameter. No atheroma in ascending aorta. Normal aortic arch
diameter. Complex
(>4mm) atheroma in the aortic arch. Normal descending aorta
diameter. Complex
(>4mm) atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.

AORTIC VALVE: Normal aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS. No AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Normal mitral valve leaflets. No MS. Mild (1+) MR.


TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets. Mild [1+] TR.


PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Pulmonic valve not well seen.
Physiologic
(normal) PR.

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify
I was present in compliance with HCFA regulations. The patient
was under
general anesthesia throughout the procedure. No TEE related
complications.
Suboptimal image quality - body habitus. The patient appears to
be in sinus
rhythm.

Conclusions:
Pre bypass: The left atrium is moderately dilated. Left
ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. There is
mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with distal
and apical
anterior hypokinesis. Overall left ventricular systolic function
is mildly
depressed (LVEF= 45-50 %). The remaining left ventricular
segments contract
normally. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal.
There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch and the descending
thoracic
aorta. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal
with good
leaflet excursion. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic
regurgitation
is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. Mild
(1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial effusion.

Post bypass: Patient is av paced, then a paced on phenylepherine
infusion. LV
wall motion appears imrproved to normal. LVEF 55%. Normal RV
function. MR is
still mild. Aortic contours intact. Remaining exam is unchanged.
All findings
discussed with surgeons at the time of the exam.
