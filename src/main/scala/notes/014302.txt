Chief Complaint:
Unresponsive, s/p intubation


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Endotrachial intubation with mechanical ventilation
PICC line placement


History of Present Illness:
70 year old female with a PMH significant for anklyosing
spondylitis, HTN, HLD, and CAD who was admitted to the ICU
secondary to unresponsiveness on [**7-27**], she was found to have
hypercarbic respiratory failure.   The patient had been
discharged from [**Hospital1 **] after treatment for CAP with azithromycin and
levofloxacin.  The patient also had been treated for C diff
after her recent discharge, she was treated with flagyl.  In
this setting she developed a fever of 101.8 and tachypnea, in
addition to fatigue and weakness.  The patient then had mental
status depression, slurred speech and confusion- EMS was called
and she was found to be hypoxic (88% on 100% NRB), she was
intubated due to respiratory failure and brought to the ER.  In
the ER she was following commands and was extubated, she then
slowly became unresponsive and hypoxic again and re-intubated
(this time nasally due to kyphosis).  She had some seizure
activity as reported by ER attending, and was given 2mg IV
ativan.  She was then admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] on [**2105-7-27**].

[**Hospital Unit Name 153**] course:
The patient was initially treated with vancomycin, meropenem and
also on acyclovir for presumed cellulitis / sepsis versus PNA.
Acyclovir and meropenem were discontinued on HD # 2, vancomycin
was continued for total 8 day course, no + culture data (with
the exception of 1+ GPCs in Pairs on endotracheal sputum sample
on [**2105-7-29**]).  She was intubated for a total of 6 days, she was
then extubated on [**2105-8-1**].  Due to sinus tachycardia small
boluses of fluid were given (500cc x 2 on [**8-3**]) and metoprolol
was started at 12.5mg po bid, amlodpine discontinue to allow
more BP room to uptitrate metoprolol.

Currently the patient feels well, no SOB, productive cough of
yellow sputum following extubation.  No orthopnea or PND
although has been sleeping nearly sitting up.  Has pedal edema
which is new over past 2 weeks.  Last BM was formed and was 1
day ago.   No N/V, good appetite, no abdominal pain.  No other
symptoms.  No F/C/NS currently, rest of ROS is negative.

Pertinent Results:
[**2105-7-27**] LOWER EXT ULTRASOUND:
1. No evidence of DVT.
2. Fluid tracking along the intermuscular plane in the right
popliteal fossa to the calf, could represent a ruptured [**Hospital Ward Name 4675**]
cyst versus hematoma.

[**2105-7-28**] CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST:
No evidence of acute intracranial process; somewhat limited
study.

[**2105-8-2**] CXR:
Extremely low lung volumes persist. Technically limited study
makes it extremely difficult to determine whether an
endotracheal tube is
indeed present. No nasogastric tube is appreciated. Large hiatal
hernia is
again seen. There may well be some patchy atelectasis at the
bases on this
extremely limited study.

HCT at discharge: 26.9
Creatinine at discharge:  0.9
Bicarbonate at discharge:  40

Brief Hospital Course:
1. HYPERCARBIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE:  At baseline, has poor
reserve given Ankylosing spondylitis and severe kyphosis as well
as hiatal hernia.  Unclear what the precipitant was in this
case.  Long-term, patient is DNR but okay to intubate.  Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **], her PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] continue discussions with patient and
husband regarding goals of care.

2. CLOSTRIDIUM DIFFICILE INFECTION:  Plan to continue treatment
through [**8-17**]; remained with little to no diarrhea during
stay.

3. VOLUME OVERLOAD:  Significant anasarca post-ICU.  Diuresed
with IV lasix in-house and discharged with plans for stockings
use daily.

4. QUESTION OF SEIZURE ACTIVITY:  Witnessed in ER in the setting
of PCO2 of 100.

5. SINUS TACHYCARDIA:  A chronic issue per old notes, likely
related to restrictive lung disease.  At discharge, HR in the
90s.

6. HTN: Discharged on propranolol and lisinopril; amlodipine was
not restarted but could be in follow-up.
