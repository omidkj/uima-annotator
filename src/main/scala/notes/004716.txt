History of Present Illness:
79 yo M with CAD s/p CABG, CHF (EF 35-40 on echo [**7-4**]), DM2,
HTN, Hyperchol, AF, CRI (baseline Cr 2.5-2.7), BOOP [**2-2**] amio

[**2110-11-10**] for diuresis with aldactone, lisinopril and BNP.02,
lasix 7.5, toprol, though per discharge summary, patient did not
have effective diuresis.  Course was complicated by afib and was

Renal Ultrasound [**2190-12-14**] - Limited portable ultrasound. Normal
appearing intrarenal arterial waveforms. The main renal arteries
are not well visualized on this exam.

[**2190-12-23**] Non-invasive vascular studies.
Pulse volume recordings in the right lower extremity
demonstrated a mildly blunted waveform in the thigh with
appropriate calf augmentation. There is some dampening at the
level of the ankle and further dampening at the level of the
metatarsal approximately 6 mm of deflection at the metatarsal
level. Although the ankle brachial index at 0.52 is decreased
compared to the prior value of 0.78. The pulse volume recordings
are improved compared to the prior study dated [**2190-11-12**].

1.  Access was retrograde via the left CFA to the right AT.
2.  RLE:  The CIA had mild disease.  The EIA had an 80% tubular
lesion
at the level of the IIA.  The CFA was normal but calcified.  The
SFA had
mild disease.   The popliteal was normal.  The AT was patent
with 80%
proximal and mid lesions.  The distal AT had a focal 60% lesion
at the
level of the DP.  The TPT was occluded proximally.
3.  Stenting of the right EIA was performed with an 8.0 x 20 mm
Dynalink.
4.  Atherectomy of the right AT was performed with a 6.5
Silverhawk.

Brief Hospital Course:
79 yo M with CAD s/p CABG, severe ischemic cardiomyopathy (EF
35-40 on echo [**7-4**]),sever MR, AF, CRI (baseline Cr 2.5-2.7)
admitted with worsening CHF symptoms for diuresis with
milrinone. Also with severe PVD and right foot ulcer.
.
1) Severe CHF - The patient initially had severe signs and
symtpoms of CHF including shortness of breath, wet crackles at
b/l bases, and elevated JVD.  He was initially started on lasix,
bumex, and natrecor while on the floor.  This regimen was [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **]
[**Last Name (Prefixes) **] (net output 200-300cc/day) given the patient's history of
renal failure and hypotension with aggressive diuresis.  Upon
obtaining a cardiac intensive care unit bed on [**2190-12-12**], a
swan was placed and the pt was started on milrinone with a goal
CI of 2.5 and SVR < 1000.  The natrecor was stopped due to
decreased UOP and BP.  Bumex was continued and zaroxylin was
added causing the patient diurese 2L.
     On [**2190-12-15**], the milrinone was discontined and the
patient was changed to hydral/imdur with a goal SBP of 100-110.
He was transferred back to the floor at that time.  At this
time, he was breathing well with clear lungs and no exam
findings consistent with CHF.  The patient continued to diurese
~500cc/day but then his creatinine began to rise.  Zaroxyln and
hydralazine were stopped on [**12-18**] and milrinone was restarted
with the patient remaining euvolemic.
   When the patient went into fulminant renal faiure from the
contrast dye given on [**2190-12-22**], the bumex was stopped.  He
began to demonstrate signs and symptoms of volume overload
including wet crackles and increased oxygen demand. Further
diuresis was initiallyl held given his poor renal function and
the renal team closely followed with the prospect of HD.
However, pt began to make urine again and his creatinine began
to trend down. He was once again started on diuresis with
milrinone. Pt had good output to this and his acute CHF
exacerbation resolved. The milrinone was then slowly weaned down
and finally stopped on [**2191-1-1**]. The bumex was restarted on
[**2190-12-31**] and titrated up to the current dose.
   At the time of discharge, pt showed no symtpoms of
deconmpensated CHF.
   Of note, pt underwent an echo on [**7-4**] showing a LVEF of
35-40%, global hk, 3+ MR, 1+ AI, dilated LA, RA, LV.
.
2) CAD - The patient has a history of CAD. He had no chest pain
or signs of ischemia during the admission. During admission, he
underwent a persantine MIBI as part of the work up prior to
intervention on his PVD and debridement by [**Month/Year (2) **] of his toe.
The MIBI was not accompanied by any anginal symptoms. The
nuclear report was signficant for a severe fixed perfusion
defect at the mid and distal lateral wall and severe fixed
perfusion defect of the basal/mid inferiour wall. The LVEF was
[**Month/Year (2) 94649**] to be 25-30%. The pt was continued on low dose ASA,
plavix, beta blocker, and statin. His ACEi was stopped following
the episode of acute on chronic renal failure. However, it was
restarted after his creatinine had trended down with no rebound
elevation of the creatinine.
.
3) Atrial fibrillation - The patient has baseline afib on
procainamide and metoprolol with a BiV pacer.  EP interogated
his pacer and found him to have properly placed leads on Echo.
His AV delay was decreased to 180ms for full BiV pacing.  Fluoro
was used for swan placement.  His coumadin was stopped and a
heparin drip was started.  His heparin drip was stopped prior to
the [**Month/Year (2) **] surgery and was not immediately restarted [**2-2**]
bleeding. However, when this had stabalized, the pt was placed
back on coumadin and heparin as a bridge to a therapeutic INR.
The pt was therapeutic on [**2191-1-2**] and the heparin drip was
discontinued. The pt's coags continued to be followed very
closely with a goal INR between 2 and 3. Pt had good HR control
on the beta blocker.
.
4) Renal Failure - The patient has baseline CRI from his
diabetes with a baseline Cr in the high 2's.  He was admitted
with a creatinine in the mid 3's which remained stable until
late in his time in the unit after aggressive diuresis
