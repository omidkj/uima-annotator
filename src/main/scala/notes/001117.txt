Service: SURGERY

Allergies:
Meropenem

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 148**]
Chief Complaint:
abdominal pain, hypotension, sepsis


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
67F w/ who initially presented to an OSH in [**Month (only) 359**] with acute
onset of abdominal pain. She was diagnosed with biliary
pancreatitis. She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for an [**Hospital1 **] on [**10-9**],
but she could not undergo sphincterotomy because of ampullary
and duodenal wall edema. A biliary stent was inserted and she
was transferred back to the OSH. Over the following days, the
patient developed respiratory distress and renal failure and was
intubated and transferred back to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.
Given ongoing
leukocytosis, a C. diff toxin was checked and was positive, and

she was started on p.o. metronidazole. She was extubated [**10-21**].

On [**11-4**] she had abrupt onset of pain with an increase in her
WBC
to 43.8. A repeat CT at the time demonstrated worsening areas of

pancreatic necrosis and increased mesenteric omental phlegmon,
but no evidence of colitis. She had a colonoscopy demonstrating

no colitis, and was treated conservatively with meropenem and
oral C. diff therapy starting the evening of [**11-4**]. Micafungin
was added on [**11-6**] thereafter as empiric therapy. She slowly
improved, with WBC trending downward to 30-40K. All antibiotics
were stopped on [**11-12**], and she was discharged to rehab off
antibiotics on [**11-14**]. WBC at that time was 30K.
She was readmitted with abdominal pain and hypotension (BP
60/40)
on [**11-16**]


Past Medical History:

Pertinent Results:
imaging:
[**11-16**] CT ABD/PELVIS: 1. Severe, necrotizing pancreatitis with
large areas of pancreatic necrosis, in addition to
retroperitoneal inflammatory change and multiloculated
peritoneal fluid (particualrly pelvic and peri-hepatic) which
have increased in volume. 2. Bilateral pleural effusions and
basal atelectasis. 3. Calcified cholelithiasis.
[**11-16**] CT-guided drainage of abdominal fluid collection: 8Fr
catheter placed w/ drainage of 600cc grey-brown fluid
[**11-20**] ABD U/S: 1. Cholelithiasis. 2. No extra- or intra-hepatic
biliary duct dilatation. 3. Small amount of perihepatic free
fluid.
4. Small bilateral pleural effusions
[**11-23**] CXR: Large bilateral pleural effusions, increased in the
interim. Pulmonary edema +
[**11-24**]: CXR:Consolidation persisting at the left lung base could
be atelectasis or
pneumonia. On the right is a new large relatively round
radiopacity in the suprahilar right lung; bilateral pleural
effisuons.

[**11-27**]: Extubated (intubated [**11-24**] with PEA)
[**11-27**]: Pulled LEFT pigtail catheter. RIGHT pleural effusion -
thoracentesis 1.1L. Repeat CXR with improved effusion on RIGHT
after thoracentesis 1.1L but reaccumulation on LEFT.
[**11-29**]: CXR: In comparison with the study of [**11-28**], the right
pneumothorax is not definitely appreciated on this limited study
that is degraded by patient motion. Continued enlargement of the
cardiac silhouette with bilateral pleural effusions and volume
loss involving both lower lungs. Monitoring and support devices
remain in place. The engorgement of pulmonary vessels is less
prominent on the current study.
[**12-2**] RUQ U/S: Complex multiseptated collection centered over L
hepatic lobe not present on prior u/s ([**10-31**]). Sm simple fluid
collection ant to the R hepatic lobe. No biliary dilatation.
Patent portal vein. Cholelithiasis w/no sign of cholecystitis.

[**12-3**] [**Month/Day (4) **]: small stones and slugde in CBD. Replaced stent.
[**12-3**] CT Abd/Pelvis - (wetread): interval decr size of
multilobulated a/p fluid collections being drained by two
pigtail catherers--residual fluid remains present; new 15x8cm L
subdiaprhagmatic fluid collection; overall stable apperarance to
extensive fatty pancreatic necrosis, no vessel compromise; L
gallstone in gallbladder, lg b/l pleural effusion w/atlectesis.


[**12-8**]: CT Abd/Pelvis: Improved bilateral pleural effusions.
Severe necrotizing pancreatitis with minimal residual normal
appearing
pancreatic tissue. Multiple intra-abdominal fluid collections
with three drains in situ. Interval decrease in fluid
collections containing drains. Other fluid collections are
stable. Large calcified gallstone. Biliary stent in place. No
evidence of cholecystitis or biliary tree dilatation.

[**12-16**] CXR: No significant change with redistribution of
bilateral pleural effusions.

[**12-17**] CT chest: (wet read) RLL, RML and LLL bronchi are
occluded, probably with secretions. bilateral lower lobe
collapse, RML collapse. Only the upper lobes are aerated, with
focal atelectasis of medial RUL. RUL with nonspecific ground
glass opacities, nonspecific (could be
infection/aspiration/hemorrhage). Small right pneumothorax.
Chest tube in right pleural space. Small bilateral pleural
effusions.

[**2189-1-11**] U/S -
1. Abdominal fluid collection measuring up to 10.4 cm and
appears to
communicate with previously placed abdominal drain.
2. No intrahepatic biliary dilation. CBD measures 8 mm with
stent in place.
3. Small amount of perihepatic free fluid.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was readmitted with abdominal pain and hypotension
(BP 60/40) on [**11-16**]. WBC ranged 48-72K on the day of admission,
and CT scan showed increased, loculated intraabdominal fluid
collections and retroperitoneal inflammatory changes. She was
admitted to the SICU and started on norepinephrine, and
CT-guided drainage of one
of her fluid collections was done, yielding 600 cc of cloudy,
grey-brown fluid. Pressors were weaned off [**11-17**] pm. She has
been afebrile, but was hypotensive [**11-16**] to 94.1. On the morning
of [**11-23**], the patient had a witnessed aspiration event and
immediately had sustained desaturations to the 60s. She was
emergently intubated but developed PEA arrest. She recovered
after just one round of epi and was transferred to the TSICU for
further management.

[**11-23**]: witnessed aspiration event w/ subsequent resp distress
and desat to 60s, PEA arrest. rhythm restored after 1 round of
epinephrine. tx'd to TSICU. bedside echo performed. pt initially
unresponsive but later awake and appropriate, following
commands. renal consult obtained. free water increased per their
recs. family updated. hypotensive requiring neo.
[**11-24**]: Diuresis. L CT guided thoracentesis. Bronch.
[**11-25**]: Continued to wean her from the vent; pigtail clamped at 6
pm; CXR at 6 am; free water flushes-100cc q6h
[**11-26**]: Pt. was bronched after L pleural tube clamped. She was put
on a SBT, but gas still showed PCO2 > 60, Bicarb 41. In
consultation with primary team we DC'd lasix drip and switched
to diamox due to concern for contraction alkalosis.
[**11-27**]: Extubated / OOB to chair
[**11-27**]: Removed Left pleural pigtail catheter. Later w/ acute SOB
found to have RIGHT pleural effusion on CXR. Thoracentesis for
1.1L with brief hypotension - given 25g Albumin.
[**11-28**]: Persistant and worsening respiratory distress -->
thoracentesis 1.1L on RIGHT and reintubated, grade 2 view. post
intubation CXR showed b/l pleural effusion; USG chest done- no
fluid on the left and minimal fluid on the right; Dophoff
advanced to post pyloric position under IR; tube feeds started;
Lasix 40 mg IV given; Bed changed.
[**11-29**]: had difficulty diuresing patient an
