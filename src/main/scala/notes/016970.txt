Brief Hospital Course:
Following ruling out for an infarction she underwent
catheterization. She was referred for revascularization.  On
[**3-17**] she was taken to the Operating Room where quadruple
bypass grafting was performed.  See operative note for details.
She weaned from by pass on Propofol and Neo Synephrine
infusions.  She remained stable, weaned from pressors easily and
was extubated.  Beta blockade was begun and diuresis towards her
preoperative weight.

CTs and pacing wires wre removed according to protocols.
Physical Therapy was consulted for strength and mobility.  She
had some brief atrial fibrillation which was treated with
Amiodarone and Lopressor.  She did convert to sinus rhythm
shortly thereafter.  Lantus and humalog were titrated for blood
glucose control.  The patient did receive two units of packed
red blood cells for a hematocrit of 24%.  Hematocrit rose
appropriately.  By the time of discharge on POD 5 the patient
was ambulating freely, the wound was healing and pain was
