IMAGING:
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2137-3-15**] - Small bilateral pleural
effusions and retrocardiac atelectasis versus air space
consolidation

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2137-3-16**] - Increased pulmonary parenchymal
density which may represent developing edema.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2137-3-17**] - Clearing of pulmonary vascular
congestion. No other significant interval change

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2137-3-20**] - Stable moderate bilateral
pleural effusions with increasing left basilar atelectasis or,
less likely, consolidation

ESOPHAGUS  [**2137-3-20**] - Normal esophagogastric anastomosis without
evidence of leak or stricture

CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2137-3-21**] - no pneumomediastinum or
pneumothorax

Chest CT : [**2137-3-24**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. Segmental right upper and right middle lobe pulmonary emboli.
2. Small mediastinal lymph nodes and a tiny 3-mm pleural-based
left upper lobe pulmonary nodule. In a patient with a known
malignancy, followup CT scan in [**2-5**] months is recommended.
3. Small bilateral pleural effusions with adjacent lower lobe
atelectasis.
4. Status post left splenectomy. There is a simple fluid
collection anterior to the pancreatic head which probably
represents a seroma.
5. Small 9-mm pancreatic head cyst. Interval 3- to 6-month CT
followup is recommended for this finding as well.
6. Diffuse pancolonic diverticula.
7. Adrenal hyperplasia
8. Solitary sub-cm. gallbladder polyp.

[**2137-3-25**]
CT guided needle aspirate of abd collection:
IMPRESSION: Successful CT-guided aspiration of a peripancreatic
fluid collection anterior to the head of the pancreas. 30 mL of
nonpurulent, brownish, non-foul smelling fluid was aspirated and
sent for microbiology, amylase, lipase, and bilirubin, which are
currently pending.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was admitted and underwent his operation on [**2137-3-13**].
His operative course was complicated by splenectomy and distal
pancreatectomy.  He otherwise tolerated the procedures well and
was transferred to the SICU post-op.  He was eventually
transferred to the floor [**3-17**] where he did well.

His pain was controlled with an epidural and PCA.  The acute
pain service was following closely.  His epidural was removed on
[**3-17**].  His PCA was continued and he was eventually transitioned
over to dilaudid po, which controlled his pain well.

CV: Patient developed A. Fib on POD#1 and was started on an
amiodarone drip.  He was hemodynamically stable without
requiring pressors/inotropes.  He was eventually transitioned to
PO amiodarone taper and he converted back to and remained in
sinus rhythm since [**3-16**].

Respiratory: He arrived in SICU intubated and was extubated on
[**3-15**].  His follow-up CXRs revealed a left pleural effusion that
was tapped by IP on [**3-19**] that resulted in 500cc of
serosanguinous fluid.  His pleural fluid had inflammatory cells
but was negative for malignant cells.  Subsequent CXRs showed
stable bilateral pleural effusions.  He responded well to
diuresis. His oxygen requirement remained high despite diuresis
and a Ct scan was done and subsegmenatl PE's were discovered.
Anticoagulation was started with a heparin drip and then
transitioned to lovenox. Coumadin was not started as of date of
discharge.  LE duplex US were negative for DVT.  He was
comfortable on supplemental oxygen via nasal canula and was
eventually discharged with oxygen.

GI: NPO with NGT until bowel function returned, NGT was removed
on [**3-19**] and was started on clears [**3-20**] and advanced to full
liquids.  TF were started @30cc/hr [**3-15**] and was advanced to goal
of 70cc/hr.

GU: His UOP was stable throughout and the Foley catheter was
removed after the epidural was discontinued.  A Foley had to be
replaced after failure to void on [**3-19**].  His Foley was then
removed on [**3-21**] and he voided afterwards.

Heme: His HCT decreased to 22.6 on [**3-15**].  This was most likely
secondary to mediastinal oozing post-op and he was transfused 2
units of blood followed by lasix.  His HCT rose to 25.5 and
stablized there.

ID: spiked temp 101.4 w/ elevated WBC to 22K [**3-15**].  His blood
and urine were cultured and were negative for infection.  His
WBC eventually returned to [**Location 213**] but on discharge was slightly
elevated to 13.9.  However, he was afebrile and did not appear
toxic. A CT scan of the abd was done on [**2137-3-25**] and an abdomen
fluid collection at the head of the pancreas was seen and
subsequently tapped by IR and was non-infectious.

T/L/D:  Post-op, he had an NGT, neck JP drain along with an
abdominal JP, a J-tube to gravity and a
