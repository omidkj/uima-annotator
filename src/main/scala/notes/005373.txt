Brief Hospital Course:
35 yo F w/ Type I DM, seizure d/o, ESRD on PD but noncompliant
with treatments; admitted with hyperkalemia, DKA.
.
1) Hyperkalemia: Patient was hyperkalemic to 8.4 on admission
with ?peaked T waves on EKG (unclear if these were new or more
marked, as patient has peaked T waves on baseline EKG).  She
initially received Ca/bicarb in the ED, but refused kayexalate,
and was placed on peritoneal dialysis regimen per [**Month/Day (4) **] recs.
Hyperkalemia quickly resolved with these interventions.
Throughout rest of hospital course, potassium was monitered and
EKG was monitored for signs of changes from hyperkalemia without
any complications.  Peritoneal dialysis was continued initially
and then patient was changed to hemodialysis (SEE below - ESRD).
 Initially patient was refusing HD and many interdisciplinary
discussions took place among primary team, psychiatry, and
social work concerning patient's decision making capacity, given
her medical history of numerous admissions over the past year
for DKA and hyperkalemia.  As patient's compliance with
recommended medical care improved, her medical problems
subsequently improved with the initiation of HD, and it was
determined that her capacity to make medical decisions (as it
pertained to her improved cognitive state and simplified medical
regimen) for her wellbeing was also improved per psychiatry's
analysis.  It was decided per these intradisciplanary team
discussions that this improvement of her baseline capacity along
with her new, more regulated outpatient medical care with HD
would provide the patient with the outpatient stability required
for adequate medical care.  Patient was discharged with plans to
begin TIW regimen of HD.
.
2) DKA/DM: The patient presented to the ED with blood sugar in
the 500's, AG = 29 and was initially admitted to the ICU for
insulin gtt until AG closed. She was transferred to the floor
and switched to glargine and covered with RISS.  On transfer to
the floor, FS were monitored QID with ISS coverage. She was on
[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Doctor First Name **] diet.  Electrolytes were monitored.  [**Last N
