Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2145**]
Chief Complaint:
Fever, hypoxia, hypotension

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 16807**] is a 60 yo M, recently discharged from [**Hospital1 18**] on
[**2128-10-11**] after a VATS w/LLL Wedge resection for lung CA on
[**10-6**].  His recent admission was complicated by hypoxia, a
pneumothorax s/p chest tube placement and removal and then
urinary retention which ultimately resolved.  He was discharged
home with VNA services to follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and
Oncology as an outpatient.
.
On the day of admission, a VNA came to change his dressings. She
found that the patient was slightly hypotensive with SBP 80's
and hypoxic and called an ambulance. The patient himself states
that has been feeling a little anxious and shaky but feels
normal. He states that the nurse over-reacted as his SBP
typically runs 90's and that he requires oxygen at baseline. He
denies any changes in his health in the past few days, denies
taking additional dilauded, no fevers, no chills, no coughing, +
vomiting on the day after discharge, but no subsequent vomiting,
nausea or diarrhea. He endorses left lateral/flank chest pain
[**1-17**] recent incisions but denies substernal or "heart" pain. No
dyspnea. He denies any sensation of lightheadedness or syncope.
.
In the ED: The patient had no complaints. Thoracic surgery saw
the patient and remarked that he was more hypoxic than baseline.
Per thoracic's his baseline is O2 88-91% 4-5L NC, BP 90's, nl
PCo2 50's. Vitals signs in the ED were SBP 80's->90's
spontaneously, O2 saturation 92% on NRB,low 80's on 6L NC, temp
101.0.  CXR clear. Started on Vanc and Zosyn. He was given
fluids. EKG showed deeper ST depressions and T wave inversion,
trop 0.6 - > started on heparin for ACS vs PE. A non-contrast CT
showed no fluid collection, no hematoma, some bibasilar
atelectasis. The patient was also found to have renal failure
and transaminitis.

[**2126**]. Lives alone with multiple family members living nearby.
Formerly worked as a computer systems engineer but had to retire
in [**2109**] due to multiple surgeries and medical problems.
Currently on disability. Reports asbestos exposure for 7 years
at a building he worked at.

Cardiac Cath ([**4-/2128**]):
1.  Coronary angiography of this right dominant system revealed
minimal disease of the LMCA, widely patent prior LAD stents,
mild restenosis of OM1, and 100% occluded RCA that fills via LCx
collaterals.
2.  Arterial bypass angiography revealed 100% occluded
SVG->R-PDA.
3.  Resting hemodynamics revealed elevated and equalized right
and left sided filling pressures with RVEDP, mean PCWP, and
LVEDP of 20 mm Hg. PASP was severely elevated at 71 mm Hg.
Systemic arterial pressure was moderately elevated.  Cardiac
index was preserved at 2.7 l/min/m2.
4.  Left ventriculography revealed 1+ mitral regurgitation and
LVEF of
50% with inferior hypokinesis.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Patent prior LAD stent, mild restenosis of OM1 stent.
3. Occluded SVG-->R-PDA.
4. Severely elevated right heart pressures and pulmonary
hypertension.
5. Equalization of left and right sided filling pressures with
possible
restrictive vs. constrictive physiology.
.
EKG ([**2128-10-14**]): Sinus rhythm. Prolonged P-R interval. Right
ventricular hypertrophy with secondary repolarization
abnormalities. Compared to the previous tracing  of [**2128-10-7**] the
inferior ST-T wave changes are not as apparent. The other
findings are siimlar. Clinical correlation is suggested.
.
CT chest/abd ([**2128-10-14**]): No evidence of focal fluid collection
in the abdomen or pelvis to suggest an abscess. No evidence of
hematoma in the chest, abdomen or pelvis. Mild compressive
atelectasis is seen in the left lower lobe subjacent to a trace
left pleural effusion. The patient is status post left VATS
wedge resection of a spiculated left lower lobe pulmonary
nodule. Note is made of subcutaneous air along the anterolateral
left chest wall.
.
RUQ U/S ([**2128-10-14**]):
FINDINGS: There are no focal liver lesions. There is normal
hepatopetal flow within the main portal vein. The gallbladder
has a 6 x 6 x 6 mm nonobstructive shadowing gallstone. The
gallbladder is not distended, and no gallbladder wall thickening
or pericholecystic fluid is present. The common bile duct is
normal measuring 5 mm. There is no free abdominal fluid. There
is no intra- or extra- hepatic biliary dilatation. The spleen is
enlarged but stable measuring 17 cm.
IMPRESSION:
1. Cholelithiasis without cholecystitis.
2. Stable splenomegaly.
.
Bilateral LENIs ([**2128-10-15**]): No evidence of deep vein thrombosis
in either leg.
.
Echo ([**2128-10-15**]): The left atrium is moderately dilated. Left
ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. There is mild global
left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 40-45 %). The right
ventricular cavity is markedly dilated with moderate global free
wall hypokinesis with apical sparing. There is abnormal septal
motion/position consistent with right ventricular
pressure/volume overload. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are
mildly thickened. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valv
