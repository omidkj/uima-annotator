CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: There is a large right
pleural effusion with atelectasis of the adjacent right lower
lobe. There is also a small left pleural effusion with left
basilar atelectasis. As noted by CT [**2117-11-19**], the left
kidney is markedly atrophic with a prominent collecting system,
measuring 23 x 31 mm. The right kidney also contains a 4.6 x 5.0
cm cyst arising from it's lower pole. In addition, there are two
subcentimeter high attenuation foci within the parenchyma of the
right kidney, unchanged in the interval, and most likely
representing hemorrhagic renal cysts, but not well evaluated on
this noncontrast CT. The right psoas hematoma has decreased in
size in the 8 day interval, now measuring 6.8 x 6.5 cm, vs. 9.0
x 9.8 cm previously.

The liver, spleen, adrenal glands, and bowel are unremarkable.
There are several punctate calcification within the tail of the
pancreas, possibly related to splenic artery calcifications or
the residua of prior pancreatitis.

CT OF THE PELVIS WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: The visualized portions of
the bowel are unremarkable. There are multiple sigmoid colonic
diverticuli, but there is no adjacent mesenteric stranding and
there are no fluid collections. A Foley catheter is present
within a decompressed bladder.

The osseous structures are unremarkable.

IMPRESSION: 1. Decreased size of the right psoas hematoma in the
eight day interval.

2. Large right, and small left pleural effusion with bibasilar
atelectasis.

3. Markedly atrophic left kidney (3.2 cm in length), with a
prominent collecting system, not well evaluated on this
noncontrast CT. There is also a right lower pole renal cyst and
two high attenuation foci within the right kidney, which
probably represent hemorrhagic renal cyst.

CT ABDOMEN W/ ORAL CONTRAST ONLY: There is a large hematoma in
the right psoas muscle that m
