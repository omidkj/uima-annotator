Pertinent Results:
Pre-CPB:
No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the left atrial
appendage.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF
50-55%).
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
The aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened. The left
cusp is hypomobile. No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are moderately thickened. An
eccentric, posteriorly directed jet of Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
A tiny fistula may be seen entering the proximal PA. By history
this comes from the Circumflex artery.
An epi-aortic scan showed no calcifications at the planned
cannulation site.

Post-CPB:
The patient is in SR on no inotropes.
Preserved biventricular systolic fxn. Trace MR. [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **]. Aorta
intact.
Fistula in [**MD Number(3) 62535**] not be visualized.

CAROTIDS:

FINDINGS: Mild heterogeneous plaques are seen bilaterally along
the proximal internal carotid arteries. The peak systolic
velocity in the right internal carotid artery ranges from 76 to
83 cm/sec and the left internal carotid artery from 72 to 77
cm/sec. The peak systolic velocity in the right common carotid
artery is 93 cm/sec and in the left common carotid artery is 80
cm/sec. Bilateral external carotid arteries are patent. There is
antegrade flow in the bilateral vertebral arteries. The ICA/CCA
ratio on the right is 0.85 and on the left is 0.90.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was brought to the operating room on [**11-20**] where the
patient underwent:

PROCEDURES:
1. Coronary bypass grafting x4 with left internal mammary
    artery to left anterior descending coronary; reverse
    saphenous vein single graft from aorta to second
    diagonal coronary artery; reverse saphenous vein single
    graft from aorta to the first obtuse marginal coronary
    artery; reverse saphenous vein single graft in the aorta
    to the posterior descending coronary artery.
2. Ligation and division of coronary to pulmonary artery
    fistula x3.
3. Epiaortic duplex scanning.
4. Endoscopic left greater saphenous vein harvesting.

Overall the patient tolerated the procedure well and
post-operatively was transferred to the CVICU in stable
condition for recovery and invasive monitoring.
 POD 1 found the patient extubated, alert and oriented and
breathing comfortably.  The patient was neurologically intact
and hemodynamically stable, weaned from inotropic and
vasopressor support.  Beta blocker was initiated and the patient
was gently diuresed toward the preoperative weight. The patient
was transferred to the telemetry floor for further recovery.
Chest tubes and pacing wires were discontinued without
complication.  The patient was evaluated by the physical therapy
service for assistance with strength and mobility. She went into
A Fib postop and converted to SR with amiodarone.

By the time of discharge on POD 5 the patient was ambulating
freely, the wound was healing and pain was controlled with oral
analgesics.  The patient was discharged home in good condition
with appropriate follow up instructions.
