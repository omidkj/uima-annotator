diet was advanced. NGT removed POD2, JP removed POD4. Diet was
advanced conservatively to regular diet POD5. She was transfused
an additional unit of blood POD 4 for [**Last Name (STitle) **] 25, post-transfusion

course was relatively unremarkable. She was discharged in stable
condition, ambulating, eating well, and with bladder spasm and
