[**2153-8-22**] Cardiac Catheterization:
1. Selective coronary angiography in this right dominant system
demonstrated three vessel disease. The LMCA was very short and
without disease. The LAD was heavily calcified with a 40% ostial
stenosis and diffuse disease proximally to at least 50% though
the mid-LAD was smaller caliber so likely more severe stenosis.
There was a 70-80% stenosis at the origin of D1. The mid-LAD was
diffusely diseased after D1 and S1 and had a tiny D2 with up to
a 90% stenosis and TIMI grade 2 flow beyond. The mid-distal LAD
was tortuous and larger caliber than the proximal LAD. The Cx
had moderately heavy calcifications and was tapered proximally.
There was a small AV groove Cx and a major OM with diffuse
moderate disease proximally leading to a mid-vessel 75%
stenosis. The ramus was modest in [**Last Name (LF) 12099**], [**First Name3 (LF) **], with mild
diffusing plaquing. The RCA was modestly calcified with a
mid-vessel 60% stenosis just before AM1. There was a distal 60%
stenosis with a tortuous RPDA with a 50% stenosis at the origin
with TIMI2 fast flow and septal collaterals to the LAD. 2.
Severe systemic arterial hypertension with SBP 218mm Hg and DBP
96mm Hg. IV nitroglycerin infusion was administered, as well as
IV and PO metoprolol.
[**2153-8-23**] Echocardiogram:
The left atrium is normal in size. The estimated right atrial
pressure is 0-5 mmHg. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic
function (LVEF>55%). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an
increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg), Grade
II (moderate) LV diastolic dysfunction. Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. There is
moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is an
anterior space which most likely represents a fat pad. Compared
with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2151-10-5**], the left
ventricle is mildly hypertrophied with moderate diastolic
dysfunction and elevated estimated filling pressures. The left
ventricular systolic function remains normal.
[**2153-8-23**] Carotid Ultrasound:
There is antegrade right vertebral artery flow. There is
antegrade left vertebral artery flow. Right ICA stenosis <40%.
Left ICA stenosis <40%.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 12100**] was admitted and underwent cardiac catheterization
which revealed severe three vessel coronary artery disease.
Please see result section for further details of catheterization
report. Cardiac surgery was therefore consulted and further
preoperative evaluation was performed. Echocardiogram showed
moderate diastolic dysfunction but otherwise no significant
valvular disease. Carotid ultrasound revealed no significant
disease of both internal carotid arteries. She remained pain
free on medical therapy and was eventually cleared for surgery.

On [**8-24**], Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 914**] performed coronary artery bypass
grafting surgery. For surgical details, please see operative
note. Following the operation, she was brought to the CVICU for
invasive monitoring on titrated phenylephrine and propofol
drips. She was extubated on POD #1 and went into atrial
fibrillation and treated with amiodarone and beta blockers as
she is a fall risk and not a good candidate for coumadin. She
converted to sinus rhythm. She had some confusion which improved
but is not completely resolved. She transferred to the floor on
POD # 4 to begin increasing her activity level.  Our wound care
nurse continued to follow her left lower extremity pre-op
ulceration from car door trauma. Chest tubes and pacing wires
removed per protocol.  She was aggressively diuresed.  By post
operative day seven she was ready for discharge to a rehab
facility.
