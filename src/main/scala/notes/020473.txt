HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
She underwent an uneventful gastric bypass procedure on [**2164-6-29**].
On postoperative day number one, she was found to be tachycardic
with low O2 sats. A CT scan of the abdomen was performed and
revealed no leak at the gastrojejunostomy but a large amount of
free air and fluid. A CT of the chest revealed no PE. She was
taken back to the OR for a presumed jej-jej leak. A small hole
in the staple line was oversewn. At that time she also had a G
tube placed. She was then transferred to the ECICU for care. She
was transferred to the floor on the [**6-2**] and was also
started on Roxicet elixir for pain. She was slowly advanced to
stage two of her diet a gastric bypass diet.  She was advanced to
stage three of her diet on the 21st.  She also had a CT scan,
which showed a small amount of fluid in the abdomen.
Interventional radiology was able to place a pigtail drain but
this did not appear to be associated with an ongoing leak. The JP
was removed.

On [**7-10**] the patient developed high gastric tube output
and emesis.  KUB flat and upright was obtained, which showed
a slight bit of dilatation and air fluid levels.  She was
made NPO. On the 28th she was restarted on stage two of her diet.
Her G tube was clamped.  She was continued on her diuresis.  On
the 28th she was advanced to a stage three of her diet and
diuresis was continued using intravenous Lasix.  The patient was
tolerating diuresis and G tube clamp well. She was O2 dependent
initially which resolved with diuresis and she was therefore
discharged to home.

The patient was instructed to continue her home medications,
which were Zantac 150 mg b.i.d., Atrovent two puffs, Eucerin
cream.  Roxicet was given.  Levofloxacin 500 mg q.d.,
Fluconazole 400 mg q day, Flagyl 500 mg t.i.d., and
Ampicillin.

The patient was discharged in stable condition to home.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
Status post gastric bypass with a reexploration and
exploratory laparotomy repair of a jejunojejunostomy leak as
well as G tube placement.

The patient is being discharged to home with home services.
