Endoscopy


History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 19784**] is an 81 yo female with PMH significant for
Hepatitis C, hepatic enchephalopathy, h/o LGIB, who is being
transferred to the MICU for BRBPR and mental status changes. Of
note, the patient was recently discharged from [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2-16**] for
RIJ thrombus and now on Coumadin. She presents today from
nursing home with concern for vaginal bleeding vs. rectal
bleeding per ER notes. She was also noted to have mental status
changes and diaphoretic. A creole interpreter was called but the
patient did not respond. Her eyes opened but no verbal response.

.
In the ED her initial vitals were T 98.3 BP 138/51 AR 60 RR 18
O2 sat 100% on 5L.
.
Upon transfer to [**Hospital Ward Name **] 2, the patient was hypotensive with
BP~80/44. She was not arrousable and not responding to facial
touching. She also had some rectal bleeding on exam. She
received a 500cc bolus and her BP improved to 92/44 and then
134/65. The patient was given a 2nd unit of pRBCs, taken to CT,
and then transferred to the MICU for closer monitoring.
.
Patient was recently discharged from [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2-16**] after she
presented with high ammonia levels and R arm swelling. She was
found to have a RIJ thrombus and was started on a heparin gtt
and transitioned to Coumadin at time of discharge. INR was
therapeutic when she was discharged. In regards to her ammonia
levels, the patient has a history of hepatic encephalopathy and
per OMR there is some concern that she is not receiving her
lactulose at the NH.
.
Per the patient's daughter, Ms. [**Known lastname 19784**] had been doing well
yesterday. Her behavior is very different from her baseline. No
report of fevers or chills.

.
[**2105-2-27**] CXR - The left PICC line was inserted in the meantime
interval with its tip projecting at the level of cavoatrial
junction. The NG tube was removed. The cardiomegaly is moderate,
persistent. Mild engorgement of the bilateral hilar vessels is
consistent with volume overload. There are no consolidation or
masses. Small bilateral pleural effusions cannot be excluded.
.
[**2105-2-24**] EGD: 2 cords of grade I varices were seen in the lower
third of the esophagus. The varices were not bleeding. Excavated
Lesions Multiple superficial acute non-bleeding ulcers ranging
in size from 10mm to 15mm were found in the antrum.
Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum
.
[**2105-2-23**] Echo: EF>60%, Mild mitral regurgitation with normal
morphology. Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
preserved global and regional biventricular systolic function.
No definite cardiac source of embolism identified.
.
Cxray ([**2-21**]): Early interstitial edema and pulmonary vascular
redistribution. Retrocardiac opacity likely represents
atelectasis although consolidation cannot be excluded on this
single view.
.
CT head ([**2-21**]): 1. No acute intracranial process detected.
2. Slight increase in mucosal thickening of the left sphenoid
sinus
consistent with chronic sinus disease.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 19784**] is an 81yo Creole speaking female with PMH of
Hepatitis C, hepatic enchephalopathy, h/o LGIB, recently d/ced
from [**Hospital1 18**] on coumadin for RIJ thrombus who initally presented
from NH on [**2-21**] with hypontension, transferred to MICU w/BRBPR
and mental status changes. Now called out to floor, mental
status improved following lactulose, being treated with
ceftriaxone for UTI, HCT stable, EGD with no acute bleeding,
plan for colonoscopy as an outpatient.
.
#Fever- Started on [**2105-2-27**], most likely due to viral syndrome.
She was evaluated with blood cultures, urine cx, stool culture
and chest xray, none of which showed any evidence of acute
bacterial infection.  She was treated symptomatically with
tylenol and oxycodone as needed for discomfort.
.
#wheezing, dyspnea - most likely due to combination of COPD
exacerbation due to viral illness and mild degree of diastolic
heart failure, CXR on [**2-27**] showed mild engorgement of bilateral
hilar vessels and possible small effusions.  She was started on
a 3 day prednisone taper on [**2105-3-2**] with plan for 30 -> 20 -> 10
then d/c.  In addition she was treated with albuterol nebs
q2hours and atrovent nebs q 6 hours.  In addition, she was given
an extra dose of IV lasix 60mg prior to discharge to help with
her dyspnea.
.
#Acute renal failure -Baseline Creatinine likely around 1.1,
currently with mild renal failure in the setting of likely
overall volume overload with a possible element of diastolic
heart failure.  She was treated with usual lasix 60mg po daily
and also given one time dose on lasix 60mg IV x1 prior to
discharge.
.
# Mental status changes: On [**Date Range **], she was encephalopathic,
most likely [**2-14**] hepatic encephalopathy vs. UTI, currently back
to baseline and stable.  Urine culture with possible urinary
tract infection, treated with ceftriaxone for a 7 day course,
last dose given [**2105-3-2**]. She was back to her baseline mental
status prior to discharge. She was continued on a bowel regimen
and lactulose three times per day.
.
# GI bleed: Per medical records she had BRBPR on examination in
the ED with Hct~22 ( baseline Hct is between 28-30), also
developed gross melena - stat Hct check demonstrated Hct 27 -->
24.9. On transfer out of MICU, HCT relatively stable at 21 with
no additional episodes of BRBRP or melena in ICU. EGD with grade
I non-bleeding varices and non bleeding ulcers in gastric
antrum. Transfused 4 units total during this [**Month/Day/Year **].  She was
treated with IV and then oral protonix [**Hospital1 **].  A PICC
