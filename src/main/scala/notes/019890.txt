Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2499**]
Chief Complaint:
fevers


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
66 W with poorly differentiated metastatic adenocarcinoma
(presumed breast primary given famililial BRCA1 mutation) on
chemo tx who has known mets to lungs, liver, omentum and bony
metastasis including vertebral mets who presents to the ED with
fevers x 1 day and 1-2 days of soft-tissue neck swelling.  Per
patient's daughter, patient [**Name2 (NI) 58747**] her last round of chemo with
taxol and carboplatin.  She was in her usual state of health
until Thursday, when she noted malaise and a vague sensation of
difficulty breathing.  In clinic on Thursday she [**Name2 (NI) 58747**] 2 bags
of platelets and was started on steroid eye drops for her
lacrimal duct obstructions ([**2-12**] previous therapy with taxotere.)
 The remained "about the same", although with persistent general
malaise until Saturday morning, when she awoke complaining of a
sore throat and was noted to have swelling around her neck,
"like a collar."  She was still able to speak, although her
voice was very rough and raspy, and to take PO's without
difficulty.  Her visiting nurse took her temp, which was noted
to be 99.9.  In the setting of the neck swelling, patient's
family brought her in to the ED for evaluation.
Of note, patient has had thrush in the past involving her entire
esophagus, for which she still takes nystatin solution.
.
In the ED, patient was found to be neutropenic.  A sepsis
protocol was started and patient was started on cefapime,
Vancomycin, and Clindamycin and [**Month/Day (2) 58747**] 6 liters of normal
saline.  A CT scan was obtained of her chest and neck. Patient
began to experience difficulty breathing as was intubated.
.
ROS: negative


Past Medical History:
1. Metastatic CA of unknown origin (likely breast given BRCA
mutation):  metastatic to liver, lungs, omentum, bones (see Onc
history below)
2. CAD:  last cath [**10-14**] w/ 20% stenosis proximal RCA; LAD stent
patent; 90% osteal stenosis DIAG1; 40% proximal stenosis LCX
3. erythema multiforme
4. temporal arteritis
5. hypothyroidism
6.Hypertension
7.Zoster X 2, mild post herpetic neuralgia
8.Vaginal bleedingS/p D+C X 2
9. Osteopenia

PERTINENT CANCER HISTORY:
- A bone scan on [**2156-3-15**] showed multiple areas of increased
tracer uptake consistent with metastatic disease in L1, the
proximal right femur, bilateral sacroiliac joints, left ischium,
and bilateral scapula as well as the occiput.
- CT scanning revealed multiple liver lesions as well as
multiple small lung nodules primarily located in the right
middle and right lower lobe, as well as a subcarinal lymph node
measuring 1.2 cm. There was also some nodularity of the omentum
consistent with omental caking.
 - Ms. [**Known lastname 58746**] [**Last Name (Titles) 1834**] a liver biopsy [**2156-3-30**] which
revealed metastatic adenocarcinoma poorly differentiated with
immunoassay positive for CK7, negative for CK20, negative for
Ttf-1 and estrogen receptor, chromogranin, synaptophysin,
progesterone receptor, and HER-2/neu.  Her serum tumor markers
including a CEA were within normal limits.  A CA-125 was only
slightly elevated at 56.  However, her CA27.29 was significantly
elevated at 177.
 - Bilateral breast MRIs have been negative.  However, given +
BRCA1 mutation and family history, presumed primary tumor is
breast CA.
 - Treatment history has included Zometa as well as one cycle of
Xeloda at 15 mg p.o. b.i.d. initiated on [**2156-4-2**].  She is
status post one dose of weekly Taxotere 25 mg/m2 on [**2156-4-20**].
She is status post palliative radiation to the right femur, low
back, and right shoulder at [**Hospital 1121**] Cancer Center, the last
treatment being on [**2156-4-24**].  Her most recent treatment has
included a combination chemotherapy of Taxotere and carboplatin.

She has finished cycle one on [**2156-5-14**].

   RADIOLOGY  Final Report

CTA CHEST W&W/O C &RECONS  [**2156-6-26**] 11:17 AM

CTA CHEST W&W/O C &RECONS; CT 100CC NON IONIC CONTRAST

Reason: PROGRESSIVE SOB, BREAST CA, ? PE
Contrast: OPTIRAY

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
66 year old woman with hx met breast ca progressive sob, spiking
fevers, now with l common femoral DVT,
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
CTA r/o PE
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.

INDICATION: 66-year-old woman with history of metastatic breast
cancer with progressive shortness of breath and spiking fevers
with left common femoral DVT. Please perform CT angiogram to
rule out pulmonary embolus.

COMPARISON: CT chest without contrast [**2156-6-25**].

TECHNIQUE: Multidetector CT images were obtained first through
the lungs without contrast, followed by a CT angiogram of the
chest in the pulmonary arterial phase. Coronal, sagittal, and
oblique sagittal reformatted images were obtained.

CT ANGIOGRAM OF THE CHEST WITHOUT AND WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:
There is no evidence for central or segmental pulmonary embolus.
The aorta contains atherosclerotic calcifications. There are
coronary artery calcifications. Otherwise, the heart is
unremarkable. A filling defect in the right internal jugular
vein is probably in situ thrombus related to the adjacent Port-
A-Cath catheter.

The airways are patent to the segmental level bilaterally;
however, there is mild interval worsening of the bilateral
multifocal interstitial opacities predominantly in the upper
lung lobes suggesting worsening atypical pneu
