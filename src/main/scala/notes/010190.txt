Allergies:
Penicillins / Sulfa (Sulfonamides) / Shellfish

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 99**]
Chief Complaint:
S/P fall

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
83 y/o female with PMH significant for HTN, syncope, and
significant weight loss over the past year admitted through the
ED s/p fall. Pt and her family report that she has been doing
very well over the last few days. Eating and drinking more than
normal. However, this morning she attempted to go from bed to
the bathroom without assistance. Her daughers heard a "crash"
and found her fallen on the bathroom floor. No LOC. Pt denies
hitting her head. Her daughters report that she did not know
their names when they found her but also report that she did not
seem confused. Her daughters put her in the wheelchair and got
her back into bed. After speaking to the pt's PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] was
transported to the ED for further evaluation.

In further ROS, no recent fevers or chills. No CP or
palpitations. Pt denies any CP but has a nonproductive cough in
association with a "cold" that she is recovering from. No
abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, or change in bowels. No
dysuria or hematuria. Pt's daughters report that she is very
unstable on her feet but deny any past falls.

In the ED, the pt's VS were 90.1  144/90  68  100% 2L NC. A
neuro consult was obtained but they did not feel that there was
a neurologic cause for the fall. In addition, an ortho consult
was obtained. The pt was found to have a pelvic fracture but no
surgical intervention needed. Her C spine was cleared. A
cardiology consult has been requested for elevated troponin. Pt
will be admitted to medicine for further care.

Past Medical History:
1. HTN- Off all meds since weight loss and occasional
hypotension.
2. Weight loss- Pt has had a 50 to 60 pound weight loss over the
past year. Normal mammogram 02/[**2174**]. Per report, normal EGD.

7. Hyponatremia
8. TFT abnormallities- [**11/2175**]
9. Mixed moderate to severe obstructive and mild restrictive
ventilation defect
10. S/P right knee replacement
11. S/P cholecystectomy

WBC SCAN: IMPRESSION: 1) Uptake in lingula and right mid lung,
most consistent with
pneumonia. 2) Decreased uptake in the distal lumbar spine.
Findings could be due to scoliosis, compression deformities, or
degenerative changes, but if there is back pain, spinal
osteomyelitis/discitis cannot be excluded. This could be better
assessed with MRI if clinically indicated. 3) Uptake in right
hand of uncertain etiology, possibly due to inflammatory
arthritis. Correlate with a direct examination of the hand.
.
CXR [**3-1**]: Large region of consolidation or focal edema developed
in the left lung between [**2-28**] and 13, and it has progressed.
Right lung is severely fibrotic and shows mild pulmonary edema
compared to the appearance on [**2-13**] before or early in this
admission.

Tip of the right PIC catheter projects over the superior
cavoatrial junction, but it could be in a small branch such as
the right internal mammary vein.

Despite a nasogastric tube, the stomach is severely distended
with air and fluid.


Brief Hospital Course:
A/P:
83 y/o female with PMH significant for HTN, syncope, and
significant weight loss over the past year admitted through the
ED s/p fall. Hospital course is discussed by problem.
.
1. pubic fracture. The patient was evaluated by ortho, and no
surgical intervention was found to be necessary, she was
provided supportive care, and began treatment with physical
therapy.
.
2. Cardiac- She was initially ruled out for MI, although her
presentation was not highly suggestive of a cardiac cause, no
stress required.  The patient was thought to be mildly
overloaded on exam, and was given Lasix multiple times for
diuresis.  However, it was later thought that her lung findings
were likely more chronic and suggestive of pulmonary fibrosis
rather than pulmonary edema.
.
3. Hypothermia- resolved.  The patient briefly went to MICU
overnight for warming and evaluation, stabilization. Endocrine
was consulted and she was started on Synthroid here for high TSH
(but normal FT4). [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] Stim was normal.
.
4. Anemia- given one unit [**2176-2-18**]; Pt with significant anemia and
a HCT of 27.5 w/ drift down to HCT 22. Her baseline HCT is in
the mid 30s. No evidence of bleeding into fracture site at
pelvis but may have had some degree on presentation. Stool
guaiacs negative here. Had recent c scope per patient's daughter
at [**Hospital6 **], which was benign, per daughter.
Hematocrit remained stable after transfusion.
.
6. [**Name (NI) 93793**] Pt followed by neuro for a history of TIAs vs CVA.
Continued on dipyridamole ASA 200-25 mg Q12H.
.
7. ID: she was treated for a UTI with levofloxacin x 10 days.
She then developed bacteremia, with multiple blood cultures
positive for CNS, last positive culture on [**2176-2-23**], with
surveillance cultures after that negative.  The patient
underwent a tagged WBC scan to further evaluate potential
sources of infection, particularly her hardware from past knee
and hip replacements; however a clear source was not found other
than increased uptake in the lungs (suggestive of pneumonia),
the back (suggestive of discitis), and the right hand (clinical
exam was benign).  The patient was initially treated with Vanc
and Gent, then changed to Vanc, cefepime, and Flagyl when she
developed a new
