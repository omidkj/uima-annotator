HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 53-year-old
female with a past medical history significant for diabetes
mellitus type 1 complicated by triopathy, hypothyroidism,
hypertension, peripheral vascular disease, status post left
fem-[**Doctor Last Name **] bypass in [**2109**] which was complicated by an anterior
MI (status post stent to LAD complicated by cardiogenic shock
and oliguria).  Of note, the patient's catheterization in
[**2110-11-4**] was performed secondary to jaw pain and
showed 50% LAD stenosis after D1, 40-50% in-stent restenosis
of LAD, 70% ostial diagonal, 80-90% mid diagonal.  Previous
catheterization in [**2111-8-4**] was performed for a positive
stress test and showed distal and proximal LAD and mid
diagonal disease.  She received a cipher stent to the distal
and proximal LAD and to her mid diagonal.

In [**2112-3-6**], a follow-up Adenosine MIBI showed a
partial reversible defect in the mid and basilar focal apical
region.  The patient was scheduled for elective
catheterization by her primary cardiologist, Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 919**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 911**],
which was scheduled for [**2112-3-29**].  She was initially
admitted to the Medicine service for pre catheterization
hydration and Mucomyst.

In the Catheterization Laboratory, stent was deployed in the
distal LAD.  The patient subsequently became hypotensive and
asystolic and was in cardiac arrest.  She received
Vasopressin, epi, Atropine, and a temporary pacer.
Catheterization showed large thrombosis throughout the left
main/LAD/diagonal.  Angiojet was performed of the distal
circumflex and LAD.  There were unsuccessful attempt at PTCA
of the diagonal.  A second stent was deployed in the distal
LAD.  The patient had a left groin intra-aortic balloon pump
placed as well as a right groin pacing wire.  She was in
normal sinus rhythm and off pressors when she arrived into
the CCU.  She arrived to the CCU intubated.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Full cardiac history includes:  1.  Perioperative
anterior MI in [**2109-9-4**], status post LAD stent
complicated by cardiogenic shock.  A catheterization in [**11-5**]
for jaw pain showed 50% LAD stenosis after D1, 40-50%
in-stent restenosis of LAD, 70% ostial diagonal, 80-90% mid
diagonal.  Catheterization in [**8-6**] for positive stress test
showed distal and proximal LAD and mid diagonal disease.  At
that time, the patient received a cipher stent to the distal
and proximal LAD into her mid diagonal.  Follow-up Adenosine
MIBI as described above in the HPI in [**2112-3-6**] showed
a partial reversible defect in the mid and basilar focal
apical regions.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION TO THE CCU:  Vital signs:
Temperature recorded BP 120/48, pulse 60, respirations 18.

settings were AC 18 (rate), tidal volume 600, PEEP of 5, FI02
100%.  Pulmonary:  Coarse breath sounds, ventilated.

LAD, 70% stenosis of the LAD, 95% stenosis of diagonal I.

EKG, post catheterization, on [**2112-3-30**] showed a
normal sinus rhythm at 62 beats per minute, normal axis,
normal intervals, low-voltage T wave inversions in aVL, poor
R wave progression.

Hemodynamic data at catheterization:  Right atrial pressure
of 18, right ventricular pressure of 40/19, pulmonary artery
pressure of 40/20, wedge pressure 22, SVR of 1112, cardiac
output 5.9, cardiac index 3.1.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  1.  CARDIOVASCULAR:  A)  Ischemia/CAD:  The
patient had thrombosis in her left main.  The etiology of
this initially was diverse including dissection/trauma,
versus question of a prior nidus and thrombus propagation
versus HIT2 antibody.  Initially, the patient received no
heparin for worry of the HIT antibody.  [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] test for the
HIT antibody was negative and a special send out serotonin
releasing assay was sent which at the time of this dictation
is still pending.  The patient required anticoagulation for
CVVH secondary to ATN (see below in section regarding renal
issues) and citrate was initially started for anticoagulation
which was subsequently discontinued when the patient's
calcium levels continued to decline.  The decision was made
after consulting Hematology regarding the HIT antibody that
the patient should be started on Argatroban which the patient
was put on for several days for CVVH anticoagulation but
since the patient had increased oozing from her line sites as
well as difficult to manage PTTs.  The decision was made
after discussing with Hematology whether heparin could be
started with close monitoring of the patient's platelet
count.  Considering a negative HIT [**Doctor First Name **] antibody test this
was felt to be relatively safe since the serotonin assay
would not be back for several weeks and the Argatroban was
difficult to manage.  The patient was started on heparin for
CVVH therapy and tolerated this well with no decrease in her
platelet count.

The patient now can tolerate heparin in her dialysate as well
as heparin subcutaneously and has had no evidence of platelet
dysfunction regarding this.  It is still unclear what the
patient's large left main thrombosis may have been secondary
to.

In relation to ischemia, the patient's enzymes were cycled
and her CK appeared to peak on the 27th at 1,853 with an MB
fraction of 6.1 and then appeared to trend downward until
[**2112-4-3**].

On the evening of [**2112-4-2**], the patient's heart rate
and blood pressure decreased with heart rate in the 50s and
blood pressure 90/60 down from low 100s.  The patient
initially was given a fluid bolus with no improvement.  The
nurse gave one amp of Atropine with no response.  The heart
rate remained in the 40s and systolic blood pressure in the
50s.  The nurse then gave 1 amp of epinephrine without prior
consultation of the house officer a
