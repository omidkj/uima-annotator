Brief Hospital Course:
On [**2180-6-13**] [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 78650**] underwent a coronary artery bypass
grafting times two (LIMA to LAD, SVG to PDA).  The surgery was
performed by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) **].  She tolerated the procedure
well and was able to be transferred in critical but stable
condition to the surgical intensive care unit.  Her chest tubes
and [**Location (un) 1661**]-[**Location (un) 1662**] drain were removed and she was weaned from her
pressors.  She was extubated on post-operative day one.  She
transferred to the surgical step-down floor by post-op day two.
She was placed on nebulizers and her lasix was increased to
address increased wheeziness.  Her respiratory status improved
with this treatment, but because her creatinine rose
transiently, her lasix was decreased. Her epicardial wires were
removed.  By post-operative day five her creatinine had improved
and she was otherwise medically ready for discharge to rehab.
