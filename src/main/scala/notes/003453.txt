History of Present Illness:
70M with [**First Name3 (LF) **] with LAD 50% (s/p stent to pLAD '[**34**]), LCX 50%, RCA
s/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] in '[**42**], hypertension, DMII, prior stroke residual
right sided weakness, OSA, Morbid Obesity, COPD, CHF EF 45-55%
(diastolic and systolic), pulmonary hypertension,
hyperlipidemia, h/o substance abuse who was found down in
apartment today by apartment staff. Tried to wake him up but he
was combative. Checked his blood sugar and it was 50. He was
given D50 and glu improved, although still with persistent AMS
so he was brought to the ED. The patient is somewhat unclear on
what happened but he does report poor PO intake for 1 week with
diarrhea and nausea but no notable weight loss.
.
Of note the patient has had 2 visits to the Ed for hypoglycemia
since [**Month (only) **], both times it improved with juice and crackers
and he was d/c'd home. He had a similar presentation [**2-13**] for
lethargy and AMS that was improved after hypoglycemia resolved.

.
In the ED, initial vs were: 96.0 70 115/58 10 98 . On exam,
pinpoint pupils, CN fine, strength good. Not oriented, falling
asleep initially. Labs notable for WBC count of 5.1, Creatinine
1.4, BNP 1075, AST 58, Albumin 3.1, CK 483, Tn:0.02. U/A and
urine tox sent but still pending.CT head was negative for bleed.
CXR showed possible vascular congestion. EKG shows multiple
PVCs, appears to have bigemeny? on the monitor. Patient was
given 1 amp d50, then FSG up to 140s, then back down to 50s
received 2nd amp. It was noted that patient was on glyburide so
started on octreotide. Blood sugar at 10pm was 78 so patient
started on a d5 gtt. Likely VBG, 02. Current vitals are 58
128/74 98% on 2L, RR 19.

pain which is chronic. He admits to some cocaine use at a party
over the weekend.

CXR:
The cardiac silhouette remains moderately enlarged. The thoracic
aorta is tortuous but unchanged. There is upper zone vascular
redistribution with pulmonary vascular indistinctness,
compatible with mild pulmonary vascular congestion.
Additionally, there are hazy ill-defined opacities within both
lung bases, likely atelectasis. No sizable pleural effusion is
seen. There is no pneumothorax. There are no acute skeletal
abnormalities.

IMPRESSION: Findings compatible with mild pulmonary vascular
congestion with bibasilar ill-defined opacities, likely
atelectasis.

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2148-2-6**] 5:36 PM

FINDINGS: Exam is slightly limited due to motion artifact.
Within this
limitation, there is no evidence of acute intracranial
hemorrhage or shift of normally midline structures. The
ventricles and sulci are prominent
consistent with age-related atrophy. There is extensive
periventricular and subcortical white matter hypodensity
consistent with chronic small vessel ischemic changes. The
basilar cisterns are preserved. Intracranial vascular
calcifications are again noted.

The visualized paranasal sinuses are clear. There is no evidence
of acute fracture.

IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial hemorrhage. Chronic small
vessel ischemic changes.
