History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 8467**] is a 62m with metastatic prostate ca, cad, osa, and a
history of mild doe with an unrevealing work-up who came to
oncology clinic today with complaints of worsening doe over the
past 5-6 days.  He states it began this past weekend with no
clear precipitant; he'd felt fine all last week.  Whereas
normally he could walk 80-90 feet on level ground before feeling
dyspneic, now it occurs at half that distance.  He describes the
sensation as one of having to work harder to [**Last Name (LF) 1440**], [**First Name3 (LF) **]
increased effort.  There's been minimal cough, minimal sputum
production, no hemoptysis, no wheezing, no orthopnea/pnd, no
chest pain or palpitations, no uri sx.  He also has no sick
contacts, no exposure to dusts or other strange environmental
phenomenon, no recent travel; his volunteer activities does
include work with the homeless, but a large portion of this is
office-related work, and he does not think anyone he's been
around has had a cough.  He further denies f/c (though had one
temp to 100.1 at home), abd pain, n/v/d/c, melena/hematochezia,
hematuria/frequency.  His appetite has been decreased for the
past few weeks but he's kept up with oral hydration.
In the oncology clinic, hi o2 sats were in the mid 90's on room
air at rest but he desatted to mid 80's with ambulation.


Past Medical History:
-Metastatic prostate CA -- Diagnosed [**2178**] after developing back
pain, and his PSA came back at 1567.  He has multiple osseous
metastases.  The cancer is hormone refractory, and he was
initially treated with lupron; when disease progression was
demonstrated on this regimen, he underwent 28 cycles of
taxotere/estramustine.  Then in [**12/2185**] he got mitoxantrone and
prednisone.  Most recently he's had taxotere and carboplatin for
12 cycles with good response though complicated by acute
colitis.  As he continued to progress off chemotherapy, he was
started on the ARIAD trial in 1/[**2186**].

-CAD -- NSTEMI [**2179**], MIBI in [**2183**] with mild, fixed defects

Social History:
Mr. [**Known lastname 8467**] lives in [**Location **] with his wife and son.  [**Name (NI) **] formerly worked
for [**Company 2676**] as a software engineer, working on the guidance
system for the Patriot missile; prior to that he was in the Air
Force.  He has an undergraduate degree in MIS and an MBA.  He
smoked 1ppd for 20 years but quit 20 years ago, has a glass of
wine occasionally with dinner, and has never used
illicit/injection drugs.  He has a labrador retriever.

His mother seems to have a malignancy but bx's have been
unrevealing thus far.

.
[**2-1**] CXR: Subtle right lower lobe posterior basilar opacity,
which may be due to atelectasis or early pneumonia. Followup
chest radiographs would be helpful. Linear retrosternal upper
lobe opacity, likely atelectasis.
.
[**2-1**] Head CT: 1. New 2.0 x 1.3 cc cm focus of hypointensity in
the right inferior frontal lobe. The appearance is nonspecific
and contusion or age indeterminate infarction cannot be
excluded. MRI is recommended for further correlation.
.
[**2-2**] LENIs: No evidence of deep venous thrombosis.
.
[**2-2**] CTA Chest: 1. Multiple segmental pulmonary emboli.
2. Patchy bilateral ground-glass opacities, likely consistent
with pulmonary edema from congestive heart failure. An
infectious process cannot be fully ruled out.
.
[**2-2**] Renal U/S: 1. No hydronephrosis.
2. Possible tiny crystal in the mid portion of the right kidney.
.
[**2-2**] CXR: Interval worsening of multifocal bilateral hazy
(ground glass) opacities, which is likely due to asymmetrical
pulmonary edema or atypical infection. Differential diagnosis
includes hemorrhage and drug toxicity.
.
[**2-5**] Echo: The left atrium is moderately dilated. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular
cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is normal (LVEF>55%). Tissue velocity imaging
demonstrates an E/e' <8 suggesting a normal left ventricular
filling pressure. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The ascending aorta is moderately dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trace aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears structurally
normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is a very small
pericardial effusion (seen posteriorly). There are no
echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
.
[**2-7**] CXR: No evidence of pneumothorax. Slight worsening of
parenchymal opacities.
.
[**2-7**] Bronchial Washings: negative for malignant cells.
.
[**2-9**] CXR: Slight improvement in bilateral pulmonary opacities.
.
CTA Chest [**2187-2-21**]:
CT OF THE CHEST WITH CONTRAST, FINDINGS:  Current studies viewed
in
conjunction with the prior exam of [**2187-2-11**].  There are diffuse
ground glass opacities throughout both lung fields, most marked
in the upper lobes.  There is relative sparing of the right
lower lobe.  There is no evidence of pulmonary embolism.  There
are no effusions appreciated.  Again appreciated is some
scattered mediastinal lymphadenopathy.  Bone windows reveal some
rarified areas within scattered vertebral bodies raising the
question of metastatic foci, unchanged compared to the prior
exam.  Small bilateral pleural effusions are appreciated and
appear new since the prior study.
.
IMPRESSION:
1.  No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
2.  Marked progression in diffuse ground glass infiltrates with
relative
sparing of the right lower lobe.  This is associated with
development of new small bilateral effusions.
3.  Study is otherwise unchanged including multiple areas within
the thoracic vertebral body raising the question of bony
involvement by this patient's underlying malignancy.
.
Wedge biopsies of lung, two:
I.  (Right upper lobe):
a.  Patchy organizing pneumonitis with features of bronchiolitis
obliterans-organizing pneumonia (BOOP).
b.  Marked accumulation of intraalve
