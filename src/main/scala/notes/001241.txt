Chief Complaint:
Congestive heart failure

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2158-11-7**] Aortic valve replacement(21 mm ON-X, Mitral valve

History of Present Illness:
Mr.[**Known lastname **] is a 59-year-old gentleman who is well known to
Dr.[**Last Name (STitle) 914**] for previous consultations  for surgical correction
of his aortic valve and mitral valve.  In [**2156-11-10**] he had a
septic left wrist.  He subsequently became bacteremic and
developed endocarditis and hip osteomyelitis.  He had a very
complex series of events which includes end-stage renal disease
secondary to glomerulonephritis for which he underwent kidney
transplant in [**2137**], which had failed subsequently and was
removed in [**2143**].  He is currently receiving hemodialysis every
Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. Dr.[**Last Name (STitle) 914**] had initially seen
Mr.[**Known lastname **] in [**2157-2-10**] for MSSA endocarditis, however, he
was not a surgical candidate at that time. On [**2158-10-3**] he
presented complaining of 5 days of abdominal pain and 3 months
of abdominal distention. He has received clearance from GI and
general surgery and now presents for surgery.

Pertinent Results:
[**11-10**] Echo: The left atrium is markedly dilated. The right atrium
is markedly dilated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are
normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF 60%). The right
ventricular free wall is hypertrophied. The right ventricular
cavity is markedly dilated with severe global free wall
hypokinesis. There is abnormal septal motion/position consistent
with right ventricular pressure/volume overload. The aortic root
is mildly dilated at the sinus level. A bileaflet aortic valve
prosthesis is present. The aortic valve prosthesis appears well
seated, with normal leaflet/disc motion and transvalvular
gradients. A bileaflet mitral valve prosthesis is present. The
mitral prosthesis appears well seated, with normal leaflet/disc
motion and transvalvular gradients. The tricuspid valve leaflets
are mildly thickened. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is
seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a small to moderate sized pericardial effusion. The
effusion appears circumferential. There are no echocardiographic
signs of tamponade. Compared with the findings of the prior
study (images reviewed) of [**2158-10-3**], the aortic and mitral
valves have been replaced. The left ventricular ejection
fraction is increased. The right ventricle remains dilated and
hypocontractile. A small-to-moderate pericardial effusion is now
present.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was admitted prior to surgery for surgical work-up,
IV Heparin bridge and [**Known lastname 2286**]. On [**11-7**] he was brought to the
Operating Room where he underwent  aortic and mitral valve
replacement. Please see operative report for surgical details.
Following surgery he was transferred to the CVICU for invasive
monitoring in stable condition. Within 24 hours he was weaned
from sedation, awoke neurologically intact and extubated. He did
require pressors for hemodynamic support for several days
post-op while in the CVICU.

[**Month/Year (2) **] was continued post-op while being followed by renal
until discharge. Chest tubes and epicardial pacing wires were
removed per protocol. Cardiology was consulted to evaluate the
patient's second degree AV block (not felt to be a candidate for
pacemaker). Heparin was initiated as a bridge until the INR was
therapeutic on Coumadin. He was finally weaned off pressors on
post-op day six and was transferred to the telemetry floor for
further care.

Physical Therapy worked with patient during post-op period for
strength and mobility. He was ambulatory and has a good home
support system and was, therfor, discharged to home.  Coumadin
was titrated for target INR 3-3.5.   This will be managed by
[**Hospital6 733**] [**Hospital 197**] Clinic ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 2173**]).

On post-op day 10 he was discharged to home with the appropriate
medications and follow-up appointments.INR today 3.4 . First
blood draw by VNA is tomorrow [**11-17**].He will resume HD schedule of
M-W-F.
