History of Present Illness:
HPI: Mr. [**Known lastname 16189**] is a 62 yo male with h/o cirrhosis secondary to
sclerosing cholangitis, UC and recent h/o of SBP. Presents after
being transferred from clinic by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 497**] for PNA, ascites,
hepatic encephalopathy and FTT. He had, per the ER notes, been
started on levaquin for PNA 5 days prior to this admission. He
also had a recent admission from [**Date range (1) 44682**] for lethargy and
was found to have hyponatremia, hepatic encephalopathy and a PNA
that was treated with a 10 day course of levaquin. At that time
there was no evidence for SBP.
Currently the patient is confused on examination and denies
recent fevers, chills, abdominal pain (though it appears he was
c/o this earlier in the day), nausea, vomiting or diarrhea.
On arrival to the ED he was afebrile with BP 137/52 HR 95 and O2
sat 94% on RA. His abdomen was distended and he had a
diagnostic/therapeutic tap with removal of ~2.5 L of fluid. He
was given once dose of ceftriaxone for possible SBP. CXR showed
findings consistent with CHF.

[**1-13**]: LIMITED ABDOMINAL ULTRASOUND: Targeted examination of all
four quadrants of the abdomen was performed. There is a moderate
to large volume of ascites. The largest collection is present
within the right lower quadrant, and skin overlying the site was
marked for paracentesis as requested.

[**1-14**] cxr:Left lateral decubitus radiograph demonstrates a
layering moderate sized left pleural effusion, and the right

pleural effusion. Allowing for decubitus positioning, there has
overall been no significant change in the appearance of the

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient is a 62 yo male with h/o cirrhosis secondary to
sclerosing cholangitis, UC and recent h/o of SBP who presented
with PNA, hepatic encephalopathy and FTT. He had a
therapeutic/diagnostic paracentesis at admission with drainage
of ~2.5 L of fluid. No evidence of SBP was seen in the ascitic
fluid, but he was treated empirically with ceftriaxone. A CXR at
admission showed a left pleural effusion and findings consistent
with CHF. He had a thoracentesis of the pleural effusion and a
chest CT to visualize whether anything was hidden behind the
effusion. He was found to have bilateral patchy opacities on CXR
and pleural fluid was transudative and c/w with parapneumonic
effusion. He developed fevers during his stay and repeat
paracentesis was done on [**1-17**] and did not demonstrate SBP. He
was started on flagyl to cover for possible aspiration PNA,
since he was spiking temps on ceftriaxone. The patient was
encephalopathic throughout his stay and treated with lactulose
and rifamaxin for this. He had decreased PO intake, so an NGT
was placed and tube feeds were started. He had an aspiration
event the next day with desat to 70s on RA and ABG that revealed
pH 7.46/46/115 on NRB.  He was transferred to the MICU for
furthur monitoring and care.  He had been stable on O2 (2L with
sats ranging from 92-97%) prior to this event.
.
In the MICU the patient was suctioned frequently and was not
started on bipap for fear of pushing the aspirated contents
further into the lungs. It was confirmed with the patient's
family that he was DNR/DNI. The patient wanted to continue
eating knowing that he would likely aspirate but was convinced
to try TPN for a short while until he got a little stronger and
his PNA was treated. He was started on TPN on [**2168-1-21**].
Additionally he had sputum samples that grew out MRSA and he was
started on vancomycin.  The patient was transferred back to the
floor on [**2168-1-21**] and was
