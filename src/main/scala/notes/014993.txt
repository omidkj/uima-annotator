CT head [**2114-10-14**]
IMPRESSION: No intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect. Chronic
microvascular ischemic change and several remote lacunar
infarcts in the right basal ganglia.
.
CXR 's
[**10-14**]: The marked interval changes are predominantly focused
within the left lower lung with patchy opacity and air
bronchograms and associated pleural effusion. Given history of
altered mental status, an infectious process such as pneumonia
cannot be entirely excluded. There, therefore, may be an
associated parapneumonic effusion. There is known underlying
emphysema, and as such, pulmonary edema may have unusual
distributions. Correlate with other clinical signs of infection.
If not present, this may be an atypical manifestation of edema
and repeat radiography following diuresis is recommended to
assess for underlying infection.
[**10-15**]:Bilateral increasing pleural effusions, left worse than
right.Bibasilar atelectasis. Underlying pneumonia in left lower
lobe cannot be excluded. Tortuous right chest tube.
[**10-17**]: Grossly unchanged appearance of the chest with left lower
lobe consolidation which might be a combination of atelectasis
and infection. Clinical correlation is recommended.
[**10-21**]:Accounting for technical and positional differences, there
is no significant interval change. Persistent bilateral
effusions and retrocardiac density again noted. Pleural fluid
layers in the minor fissure. No PTX.
.
EKG's
[**10-14**]: Atrial fibrillation with controlled ventricular response.
Probable left anterior fascicular block. Probable prior anterior
myocardial infarction. Compared to prior tracing of [**2114-10-5**] no
diagnostic interim change.
[**10-18**]:Atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response,
average
about 120 beats per minute. Borderline left axis deviation. Slow
R wave
progression. Cannot exclude underlying anterior myocardial
infarction.
Probable left ventricular hypertrophy. Non-specific ST-T wave
changes.
Compared with previous tracing of [**2114-10-18**] ventricular response
is somewhat faster. Clinical correlation is suggested.
[**10-19**]: Atrial fibrillation with a relatively rapid ventricular
response of about 105 beats per minute. Compared with previous
tracing of [**2114-10-18**] QRS axis is more leftward. Ventricular
response is not quite as fast. Multiple
other abnormalities are as reported.
.
Echocardiography [**10-19**]
The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right atrium is
markedly dilated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left
ventricular EF is preserved (LVEF>55%). Inferior hypokinesis is
suggested, but due to varying R-R interval and resting
tachycardia, this is not confirmed. There is no ventricular
septal defect. The right ventricular cavity is moderately
dilated. Right ventricular systolic function is normal. The
aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is a
minimally increased gradient consistent with minimal aortic
valve stenosis. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral
valve prolapse. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate to
severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is severe
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2114-8-3**] the
degree of mitral regurgitation and pulmonary hypertension
detected have increased. The patient is more tachycardic.
Inferior hypokinesis is suggested but not confirmed. If
clinically indicated, a repat study after better rate/rhtyhm
control may better define regional LV systolic function.
