Brief Hospital Course:
She had a prolonged SICU course following this surgery, which is
summarized below in an organ system based approach.

Neurologic: Despite waking soon after extubation in the first
week postop, she developed increasing lethargy for the next
several weeks.  Neurology was consulted, and both radiographic
imaging & EEG were negative for pathology.  Her lethargy was
ultimately attributed to poor clearance of sedating medications
and she finally perked up about three weeks after surgery.
Zoloft was empirically started for depression, with some
benefit.  Neurontin was started for pain control.  Following
placement of her transgastric jejunostomy tube on [**6-2**] the
patient did require intermittent subcutaneous morphine and
vicodin.  Her mental status was markedly improved following
transfer to the floor.  WIth minimization of sedating
medications she is alert and oriented.

Cardiac: She received perioperative beta blockade after her
initial dependence on vasopressors was weaned.  Her preop runs
of ventricular tachycardia persisted for a couple days postop
but eventually subsided.  About 1 week postop, she developed
atrial fibrillation which responded to amiodarone.  Cardiology
was consulted and anticoagulation was decided against after she
reverted to normal sinus rhythm by POD14.  She remains on
amiodarone and lopressor.  She remained in normal sinus rhythm
from the time of her transfer to the floor on [**2160-6-30**].

Respiratory: Her mental status led to a difficulty weaning off
the ventilator & in fact, she required re-intubation due to
tachypnea & poor clearance of secretions.  Once extubated a 2nd
time, she avoided reintubation with frequent nebs, suctioning &
chest PT.  By the time of discharge, she has saturations of
96-100% on nasal cannula.  She did require frequent chest PT and
nebulizer treatments as well as encouragement to breathe deeply.

FEN: She was about 20 kg over her dry weight (70kg) during this
admission.  She received diuresis with lasix & diamox, with good
effect.  Nutritionally, she was sustained periop with TPN &
transitioned to tube feeds once her ostomy was functional.
Following removal of her dobhoff tube, a swallow consult was
obtained.  The swallow specialists recommended the following:
"begin a po diet, but with modified solid textures to reduce the
work of chewing. Thin liquids are recommended, as they appear no
different than nectar thick liquids, and only very
trace aspiration occurs."  However, per the nutrition service
the patients caloric intake was insufficient to meet her
nutritional needs.  Thus a transgastric jejunostomy tube was
placed on [**2160-6-2**] by interventional radiology.  In consultation
with the nutrition service the patient was rapidly advanced to
her goal nutritional support of 65ccs/hour of Promote with
fiber.

GI: She receives a PPI for GI prophylaxis.  She tolerated tube
feeds via a dobhoff tube & her ostomy is functional.  Her
voluminous ostomy output is controlled with banana flakes TID.
She had a slight amount of drainage from her abdominal wound in
her 2nd postop week, during several staples were removed.  This
is healing well at the time of discharge with wet to dry
packings.  Her ostomy consistently appeared pink and the patient
was getting routine ostomy care from the enterostomal nurse at
the time of discharge.

HEME: She had blood loss anemia & anemia of chronic disease
requiring multiple RBC transfusions.  She developed severe
sepsis about POD14, during which time her WBC count dropped to
neutropenic levels & she was treated with neupogen at the
suggestion of the heme onc team.  She also developed
heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, for which her heparin was DC'd
& she was continued on daily aspirin.  The primary surgical team
decided against an IVC filter.  At the time of discharge her
only blood thinner was aspirin.

ID: She develop pseudomonal & fungal pneumonia, bacteremia,
urinary tract infections, sepsis & septic shock.  The ID team
consulted on the case.  She was successfully treated with
meropenem & fluconazole prior to discharge.  At the time of
discharge the patient was noted to have a recurrent pseudomonas
urinary tract infection resistant to levofloxacin thus the
patient was discharged on a course of meropenem. Her foley
catheter was to be d/c'ed on arrival to [**Hospital6 13314**].
ENDO: Her diabetes was being managed initally with an insulin
drip and at the time of discharge a sliding scale.  However, her
blood sugars rarely required insulin coverage at the time of
discharge.  Hypoadrenalism was treated early in the [**Hospital 228**]
hospital course with hydrocortisone. The patient also was noted
to have sick euthyroid syndrome.
