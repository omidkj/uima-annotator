[**2169-4-27**] POD6: VSS> Planning discharge home when patient became
acutely paranoid. Psychiatry and geriatric consults obtained.
Psychiatry: A: 69 yo man with delirium
Rec: 1)continue security sitter--he finds this very calming and
reassuring
2)haldol 5mg and ativan 2mg now--given; he accepted po
medications
would give standing haldol 2mg TID po with ativan 1mg TID po--
though he is likely 8 days from his last drink and his CIWA
scores have not been >10, will monitor for alcohol withdrawal
would use ativan instead of valium for CIWA
3)if possible to give thiamine 100mg IV (instead of po)
4)if he becomes physically agitated or his paranoia compromises
his acute health care, would at that point recommend haldol
2.5mg-5mg IV q2h with ativan 1-2mg IV q4; follow respiratory
status with ativan use and follow EKG
5)would obtain head imaging, consider EEG
6)would check LFTs, b12/folate, rpr, TSH
follow on hct and plts trending down
7)currently would not recommend discharge given his current
state; his family do not feel comfortable taking him home with
this level of paranoia either
