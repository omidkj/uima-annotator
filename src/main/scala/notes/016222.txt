HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 85-year-old
female who was admitted on [**7-22**] for resection of a left lower
lobe adenocarcinoma.  She was transferred from the MICU
service after a prolonged hospital course, notable for
multiple PNA's and atrial fibrillation.  She was transferred
to the MICU for failure to wean.  This patient was first seen
by pulmonary in [**5-7**] when she began complaining of new onset
shortness of breath plus notable for chronic cough.  She had
some weight loss and decreased appetite.  She was admitted
for surgery on [**7-22**].  There was a left lower lobe resection
done with pathology that showed adenocarcinoma.  She was
extubated after surgery and then on [**7-25**] she went into atrial
fibrillation and her blood pressure dropped to the 90's and
she had shortness of breath.  She was given Pronestyl,
Lopressor, Lasix and she was diuresed with 500 cc, eventually
converted back to sinus rhythm.  Her troponin at that time
was 3.4 and her CK MB was negative.  She again became short
of breath on [**7-26**], diagnosed with left lower lobe collapse on
chest x-ray.  She was intubated and had left lower lobe thick
secretions and collapse was thought to be secondary to mucus
plugging.  ABG at that time on vent was 7.46 PH, CO2 46, O2
107.  She was rebronch'd the next day on the left airway that
showed plugging.  She was briefly on Diamox and weaned to a
pressure support of [**5-11**], resting in an IMV overnight.
Respiratory rate was in the 20's and total volume 200-400 at
that time, then extubated.  She was reintubated secondary to
a decreased saturation and an increased CO2 and rebronch'd on
[**7-29**] with thick secretions and a plug on [**7-29**].  She was
started on Augmentin prophylaxis on [**7-29**] for continued
secretions.  A tracheostomy was placed on [**7-31**].  On [**8-5**] her
Augmentin was discontinued.  Then she was slowly weaned off
her ventilation.  She tolerated her trach mask.  She had a
period of atrial fibrillation on [**8-7**] with rates in the 70's
and a systolic blood pressure in the 70's.  She was put on
her trach mask for 24 hours and did well but did not tolerate
PMV.  The patient had complained of difficulty breathing,
also had secretions and was unable to tolerate oral food.  A
PEG was placed on [**8-10**].  She was then transferred back to the
floor on [**8-11**].  Cardiology fellow called emergently for
systolic blood pressure in the 60's and heart rates in the
30's.  The patient had been subtherapeutic on Pronestyl.  She
was administered 200 joules with a brief normal sinus rhythm,
transient increase in systolic blood pressure but then
reverted back to atrial fibrillation.  She received Esmolol
and Amiodarone, eventually converting to sinus rhythm.
Anticoagulation was then recommended.  Amiodarone was
continued at 400 mg tid times one week and later changed to
400 mg [**Hospital1 **].  On [**8-15**] at 5 a.m. the patient was found cyanotic
with her tracheostomy mask off and saturations from 80-85%.
The patient was then transferred to the MICU with an O2
saturation in the 90's and heart rate in the 150's with a
respiratory rate of 28.  She was given Lasix 20 mg IV, became
unable to maintain her saturations on her trach mask.  ABG at
that time was 7.39, 62 and 75.  Patient then came back into
sinus rhythm at 83 beats per minute.  The patient had
moderate thick, yellow secretions.  She was bagged, tried to
replace the trach mass but saturations continued from 88-90%.
She was placed back on the ventilator.  She was brought back
to the ICU and found to have bilateral pulmonary infiltrates
via chest x-ray.  She was then bronch'd on [**8-15**] in the morning
and found to have minimal secretions.  Her hospital course
was notable also for intermittent confusion but baseline
orientation.  She was also hypotensive to pain medications.
She currently has some difficulty breathing on the
ventilator, was otherwise comfortable and denies pain or any
other complaints.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Peripheral vascular disease.  She had
an AAA repair in [**2100**] by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1476**], notable for
hypertension, atrial fibrillation, osteoporosis, right hip
replacement, 100 pack year history of smoking, seasonal
allergies and emphysema by pathology.

ALLERGIES:  Possibly Ciprofloxacin causing confusion, dated
[**11/2118**], otherwise no known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS:  On transfer to the MICU, Premarin .625 mg po q
d, Amiodarone 400 mg po bid, Levaquin 500 mg po q d, subcu
Heparin [**Hospital1 **], Lopressor 25 mg [**Hospital1 **], Aspirin 81 mg po q d,
Multivitamin, Albuterol nebulizer and Albuterol inhaler q 4
hours, Impact with fiber 50 cc per hour, Dulcolax, Combivent.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Sister died at 93, mother died at 72 and
father died at 84, all in reasonably good health until later
years.  No family history.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Patient lives alone in [**Location (un) 10059**], employed as
a social worker, no asbestos exposure, now retired, smoked
two packs per day for about 6 years, then quit, drinks
occasionally.  Her proxy is [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name (NI) 36924**], [**Telephone/Fax (3) 92812**]?
(last digit missing).

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Patient's vital signs on transfer to
the MICU, temperature 98.6, pulse 67-99, blood pressure 88/40
to 100/44, ins and outs, positive 250 cc, ventilator SIMV 450
times 8, 7.5 and 50% O2, pressure support 15, total volume
290, saturation 98%.  In general, cachectic, elderly white
female lying in bed, tracheostomy on ventilator, in no acute
distress.  HEENT:  Shows PERRLA, EOMI, grossly intact, NCAT.
Neck supple, EJ engorged, unable to assess JVP.  Heart,
regular rate and rhythm with 3/6 systolic murmur left lower
sternal border, stable with respirations and no S3 or S4.
Pulmonary, diminished sounds at bases, anterior bronchial
breath sounds on left.  Abdomen distended, PEG in place,
positive bowel sounds, nontender and soft.  Extremities,
distal pulses full, trace edema, symmetric.  Neuro, patient
is very hard of hearing, difficult to arouse, but once
aroused she is alert and appropriate and able to mouth words
appropriately.

LABORATORY DATA:  On admission to the MICU, white blood cells
17,000, hemoglobin 10.7, hematocrit 32.5, platelet count
282,000.  Dipstick urinalysis showed moderate blood, positive
nitrites, 100 protein, glucose negative, ketones trace,
bilirubin negative.  Glucose 125, BUN 26, creatinine 0.4,
sodium 131, potassium 4.0, chloride 90, CO2 30, calcium 9.2,
phosphorus 2.4, magnesium 1.4.  Arterial blood gas with PH
7.46, CO2 47 and PO2 122.  Chest x-ray from [**8-15**] showed some
interval clearing of the left base with progressive
infiltrate and left upper lobe and right upper lobe
consistent with infection vs edema.

ASSESSMENT & PLAN:  This is an 85-year-old status post left
lower lobe lobectomy for adenocarcinoma.  Hospital course was
complicated by respiratory distress from mucus plugging,
rapid atrial fibrillation and failure to wean.  The patient
now has a tracheostomy and a PEG tube status post an episode
of respiratory distress on the floor, likely secondary to
decreased FIO2, rapid atrial fibrillation with elevated white
blood cells and infiltrate on chest x-ray.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  Pulmonary:  Pneumonia, given multiple infiltrates on the
chest x-ray and elevated white blood cell count, treating
aggressively for gram negative and will double cover with
Levaquin and Ceftaz.  One dose of Levaquin already given in
the a.m.  Patient's effusions are bilateral.  Would tap if
clinical course does not improve.
2.  Congestive heart failure:  Patient likely has diastolic
dysfunction when in rapid atrial fibrillation.  She was then
bolused with fluid for hypotension.  Would likely keep the
patient slightly dry as tolerated by blood pressure,
ventilation, continue to wean as tolerated and change
pressure support as tolerated.
3.  Cardiology:  Rhythm, atrial fibrillation on Amiodarone.
We sent LFTs and TSH and we will taper per cardiology.  She
is on Lopressor for blood pressure and ra
