Service:  MICU-ACOVE
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 58 year old woman
with multiple medical problems including congestive heart
failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, sleep apnea, cor
pulmonale with right heart failure, obesity, and end-stage renal
disease requiring hemodialysis.  The patient has had recent
admissions at the [**Hospital1 69**] in
[**Month (only) 956**] and [**Month (only) 958**] of this year, most notably for a line
infection.  Two days prior to admission, the patient's son noted
increasing somnolence.  The patient underwent hemodialysis on
[**2188-7-7**], and was subsequently noted to be more somnolent by
her [**Hospital6 407**].  As such, she was referred back
to the [**Hospital1 69**] for further
management.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Morbid obesity.

with marked right ventricular dilation; left ventricular
function 58 to 55%, four plus tricuspid regurgitation with
severe pulmonary hypertension.
3.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
4.  Obstructive sleep apnea; the patient does not use BiPAP
at home and has known right heart failure and cor pulmonale.
5.  Hypertension.
6.  History of atrial flutter not currently anti-coagulated.
7.  Chronic renal insufficiency on hemodialysis.
8.  Peripheral vascular disease.
9.  Multiple urinary tract infection, most recent being a
Klebsiella and E. coli in [**Month (only) 958**] of this year.

ALLERGIES:   The patient has a reported allergy to Demerol,
unknown effect.  The patient is also allergic to nuts
resulting in anaphylaxis.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient has a 70 pack year history of
tobacco use.  She also notes ethanol abuse.  She is married;
she is bed and wheelchair bound secondary to deconditioning.
She has a [**Hospital6 407**] and has family members
assist her activities of daily living.  The patient has
refused rehabilitation in the past.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission, temperature 99.4 F.,
pulse of 86; blood pressure 101/40; respiratory rate of 19
with an oxygen saturation of 93%, with mechanical ventilation
FIO2, 30%, pressure support 5, PEEP of 5.  The patient was
somnolent but arousable to noxious stimuli.  Her HEENT
examination was unremarkable with pupils equal, round and
reactive to light.  Sclerae anicteric.  Extraocular movements
are intact.  Mucous membranes dry without oral lesions.  Her
neck was supple, obese.  A right IJ catheter was in place.
It was difficult to assess jugular venous distention.
Carotids were two plus without bruits.  Her heart sounds were
distant but regular in rate and rhythm without notable
murmurs, rubs or gallops.  Normal S1 and S2.  Her lungs had
bibasilar crackles, right greater than left.  No wheezes were
noted.  Her abdomen was obese, soft, with diffuse mild
tenderness.  Her extremities had no cyanosis, clubbing or
edema.  She had a 2 cm by 3 cm ulceration on the right
lateral aspect of her shin, with a question of purulent
drainage.   On neurologic examination, she was oriented to
place only.  Reflexes were symmetric bilaterally.

LABORATORY:  On admission, white blood cell count 14.4,
hematocrit 33.5, platelets 175, MCV of 102.  Sodium 138,
potassium 4.1, chloride 101, bicarbonate 23, BUN 19,
creatinine 3.1, glucose 94.  Calcium of 9.0, phosphorus of
3.4, magnesium of 1.5, free calcium of 1.32.  Differential on
the white blood cell count is as follows:  77% polys, 7
bands, 9 lymphs, 5 monos, 2 eosinophils.

Initial arterial blood gas is as follows:  pH 7.19, pCO2 of
69, pO2 of 43.  Chest x-ray showed increased interstitial
lung markings in the lower lung zones, hilar fullness, mild
congestive heart failure, question of infiltrate.

EKG was normal sinus rhythm at a rate of 65, borderline right
axis deviation with right bundle branch block.  Mild ST
depression in the precordial leads.  No significant changes
from prior EKG of [**2188-5-15**].

SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  In the Emergency Department, the
patient was found to be afebrile and hypotensive with systolic
blood pressure in the 70s.  The patient was given fluid
resuscitation and with 1.2 liters, subsequent chest x-ray showed
mild congestive heart failure.  Her white blood cell count was
noted to be elevated at 14.4 with a left shift.  As such, she was
started on antibiotics of broad-spectrum, including Vancomycin,
Levofloxacin and Flagyl.  Arterial blood gas was 7.19/69/43.  The
patient was started on Dopamine after placement of a right IJ
catheter and transferred to the Intensive Care Unit for further
management.

The patient was intubated for her progressively worsening
acidosis with repeat arterial blood gas of 7.17, 68, 64.
After intubation, the patient's next arterial blood gas was
7.22, 54, 102.  Cultures were taken including blood, sputum
and of the wound.  Only colonizing organisms were noted from
the right shin wound culture, including Methicillin resistant
Staphylococcus aureus.

Given her previous history of resistant Klebsiella and E.
coli, the patient's antibiotic coverage was changed to Meropenem
for renal dosing and Vancomycin.  The patient was then continued
on a ten day course of these antibiotics with good response.  It
was believed that the patient most likely suffered from a
pneumonia and, on [**2188-7-12**], the patient self-extubated.  The
patient subsequently developed stridor and was started on
steroids and re-intubated.  The patient continued to do well and,
on [**2188-7-13**], pressors were weaned off, and the patient was
subsequently extubated and then transferred to the floor on
[**2188-7-14**], to complete her ten day course of antibiotic.

The patient continued to convalesce well and on [**2188-7-17**], was
discharged to home without change in any of her prior
medications.
