History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 52 yo F with h/o ETOH and cocaine abuse who
presented to an OSH from home after a drinking binge and
ingestion of cocaine with symptoms of withdrawal, black diarrhea
and abdominal pain. She states that she usually binge drinks
around [**9-17**] which is her mother's birthday. She has had
little po but ETOH for the past two days and reports a single
ingestion of cocaine with her girlfreinds several days ago. She
reports history of DTs but no history of seizures. Vitals on
scene were BP 165/124, HR 1008, o2 97. Her glucose was 47. She
was brought to [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] ED and her ABG there was 7.45/45/18.
Her lactate was 10 and Hct 57. sodium and K 130, 2.5. Her CIWA
WAS 36 and she was given ativan (total 1.5 mg iv). A central
line was placed and she was given 7L IVF. She remained
hypotensive to the 70s and norepinephrine was stared. She also
received zofran 4mg iv x1, zosyn and k and mag repletion. Before
transfer to ED here, ABG was 7.31/37/78 and lactate 2.7. On
arrival to ED here, BP 128/57 HR 81 O2 96 on 2L NC. Her
antibiotics were broadened to vancomycin/zosyn given her
hypotension and given her OB positive stool and abdominal pain
with elevated lactate, a CT was obtained which showed
non-specific enteritis. Surgery was consulted and recommended
admission to medicine with GI consult and CTA id persisetent
concern for ischemic colitis.  During her ED course she received
valium 10 IV x 2, protonix 80mg IV x 1 and additional K
repletion. He levophed was weaned and has been off since 0510
this am.
.
On arrival to ICU, she is complaining of abdominal pain. She
states taht she has had nothing but etoh for 3 days. Her binge
began 3 weeks ago. She drinks at least a gallon of dark rum per
day. Other than when binging, she does not drink every day and
can go "for weeks". She used cocaine only once and prior use
before then was about a year. She reports that she began
vomiting and having diarrhea on sunday. She did not have any
ETOH to drink on Monday. On tuesday, she felt withdrawal
symptoms and had six "nips" (airplane bottle size). Her sister
called EMS that evening. She reports seeing maroon blood in her
diarrhea, mioxed in. She has seen this before and has assumed
that it is from her hemorhoids which falre whn she drinks. She
denies seeing any blood or coffee grounds in her emesis.

TTE:
The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal
cavity size. Overall left ventricular systolic function is low
normal (LVEF 50-55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free
wall motion are normal. The diameters of aorta at the sinus,
ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and
no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is
normal. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Mild hypokinesis of the basal to mid left ventricle.
Mild mitral regurgitation.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2158-9-13**], the
function of the basal to mid segments has improved and is nearly
normal. The degree of mitral regurgitation has decreased.

CXR:
FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient
has been
extubated and the nasogastric tube has been removed. The
bilateral
parenchymal opacities are unchanged in extent. A minimal
right-sided pleural effusion might have newly occurred.
Unchanged size of the cardiac silhouette. No pneumothorax.

an ICU (described by daily events below), and subsequently the
general medical floor (divided by problem).

52F with h/o ETOH and cocaine abuse, suicide attempt in [**Month (only) 596**]
[**2158**] who presented to an OSH and transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] ICU
after a drinking binge and ingestion of cocaine with symptoms of

[**9-12**]:
-per PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 3726**]: HCT 41.8 in [**3-/2158**], 39.9 in [**10/2157**]
-CT read: 1. Abnormal small bowel, with segmental areas of wall
thickening and mild peripheral stranding which may be contiguous
(or separated by a small amount of normal small bowel) from
inflamed terminal ileum. This picture is compatible with
enteritis, which could be inflammatory, infectious, or, less
likely, ischemic
2. Probable colonic wall thickening and fatty infiltration
consistent with chronic inflammatory changes in the proximal
colon.
3. Fa
