History of Present Illness:
This is a 75 y.o. man with history of diabetes mellitus,
hyperlipidemia, hyperlipidemia, coronary artery disease,
systolic CHF (EF 25%), and moderate aortic stenosis who
presented to an outside hospital with dyspnea.  He was seen in
clinic on [**2110-8-11**] and then admitted to the outside institution
for a probable CHF exacerbation.  At the outside hospital he had
diuresis initiated with IV bumetanide, but despite initially
encouraging results he continued to be in a severe CHF
exacerbation.  A transthoracic echo was obtained that showed a
left ventricular ejection fraction of 15%, which was worse than
prior results.  This was thought due to in-stent thrombosis of
his previous interventions and cardiac catheterization was
planned for [**8-18**] but was unable to be performed secondary to
patient's volume overload from pre-cath hydration.  He finally
had this catheterization at the outside hospital on the day of
admission, which showed significant in-stent thrombosis of the
LAD.  As only diagnostic catheterizations could be performed at
the outside hospital he was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for definitive
management.
.
After arrival at [**Hospital1 18**] the patient had a second therapeutic
catheterization, which showed the same lesions identified at the
outside hospital.  He had two DES placed to reopen his stenosed
LAD and received 80 mg IV furosemide in the cath lab secondary
to his complaints of dyspnea.  Given his O2 saturation was 94%
on 100% non-rebreather he was admitted to the CCU for further
management.

Past Medical History:
-Hypertension
-Hyperlipidemia
-Chronic Kidney Disease with baseline creatinine of 3
-Prostate Cancer status post brachytherapy
-Radiation enteritis status post laser ablation
-Radiation proctitis
-Gastroesophageal reflux disease
-Status post cervical spine intervertebral disc surgery
-Diabetes mellitus, poorly controlled
-History of gastrointestinal bleeding secondary to hemorrhoids
-Status post right knee arthroscopy

Social History:
He is a retired police officer who was recently widowed.  He
currently lives with his daughter.  [**Name (NI) 1139**] history is
significant for cigar smoking for 20 years but none for the last
20 years.  He doesn't currently drink but has a history of
consuming a six-pack a day for approximately 20 years in the
past.  He denies any history of illicit drug use.

Family History:
Notable for CAD in his father who had an MI at age 61.  His
mother had throat cancer.

Physical Exam:
On Admission:

Heart: RRR, III/VI systolic murmur, II/VI diastolic murmur, JVD
difficult to appreciate due to habitus
Lungs: decreased breath sounds posteriorly especially in bases,
crackles 2/3 up lung bilaterally.
Abd: Soft, ND, BS+, only tender in area of previous shingles on
R flank w/ small slightly pigmented zoster scars.
Ext: Small amount of blood at cath site, tender to palpation, no
hematoma. Feet warm/ WP, DP pulses 1+ Bilaterally. 3+ pitting
edema of lower extremities.
.
Discharge exam is notably changed as patient is breathing
comfortably on room air.  VS: T 98.9, BP 127/72, HR 90, RR 20,
O2 Sat 93% on RA.  Lungs stil have crackles in bases but not as
far up as on admission.  Extremities to trace pitting edema.
Exam otherwise not significantly changed.

[**2110-8-21**] TTE
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is mild to moderate
regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with hypokinesis
of the inferior, inferoseptal walls, mid- to distal anterior
septum, and the apex (multivessel CAD). The remaining segments
contract normally (LVEF = 40%). Right ventricular chamber size
is normal with focal hypokinesis of the apical free wall (CAD
pattern). There are three moderately thickened aortic valve
leaflets. There is moderate aortic valve stenosis (area 1.1
cm2). The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is
no mitral valve prolapse. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is moderate
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient is a 75 y/o M with hx of DM, HTN, hyperlipidemia and
known CAD who presents to [**Hospital1 18**] from outside hospital for
intervention/ catheterization for in-stent thrombosis of a stent
in his LAD.  Patient had previously presented to OSH with
dyspnea and found to be in CHF exaccerbation.

# CAD - The patient underwent placement of drug-eluting stents
x2 to the LAD for in-stent thrombosis and was maintainaed on ASA
and plavix along with his home dose of statin. ACE inhibitor was
held as a result of his elevated creatinine. He had no further
chest pain at our institution and showed no EKG changes. Because
of his renal dysfucntion the plan is to restart his ACE around
[**9-1**] after 1 wk improvement in renal function.

# Pump - His OSH TTE showed an EF of 15-20% with significant
focal akinesis and hypokinesis along with moderate aortic
stenosis.  BNP on arrival to our institution was 52K. Initially,
we attempted to continue diuresis with furosemide without
response so we proceeded to attempt diuresis with bumetanide and
chlorathiazide.   Furthermore, he was loaded on digoxin in hopes
of inotropic benefit.  Unfortunately, these interventions were
not effective and we informed the patient he would need dialysis
to remove volume.  Given hypotension CVVH was considered the
preferred modality for HD .  The patient initially refused this
given his previous poor health and the thought that his ejection
fraction was quite poor.  After having his LAD reopened a repeat
TTE showed an EF of 40%.  This led him to reconsider his options
and with the support of his family he accepted CVVH.
Unfortunately, before this could be initiated he went into
hypercarbic respiratory failure and was unable to lay flat for
the placement of a dialysis CVL.  Therefore, he was
semi-electively intubated for placement of a line for dialysis.
He underwent CVVH over 3 days with greater than four liters
removed and improvement in his bilateral effusions and oxygen
requirement. CVVH was stopped, he was extubated, and he
continued to auto-diurese w/improvement in pulmonary function,
decreased edema and decreased need of inspired oxygen. His home
