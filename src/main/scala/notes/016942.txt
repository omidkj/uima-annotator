Admission Date:  [**2108-8-26**]       Discharge Date:  [**2108-9-19**]

Date of Birth:   [**2039-8-22**]       Sex:  F

Service:  [**Hospital Unit Name 196**]

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 69 year-old
female with a past medical history of coronary artery disease
status post myocardial infarction in [**2099**], hypertension,
noninsulin dependent diabetes mellitus, peripheral vascular
disease, congestive heart failure, ischemic cardiomyopathy
who presents from [**Hospital3 **] in congestive heart
failure.  The patient initially presented to [**Hospital3 **]
Emergency Room on the [**12-25**] reportedly feeling
more and more short of breath despite sitting up in bed and
in her chair.  The patient admits to feeling chest pressure.
No pain, however.  The patient felt it was initially an
asthma attack.  In the [**Hospital1 **] Emergency Room the patient was
given 100 mg of IM Lasix followed by 80 mg and subsequently
had a urine output of 750 cc and felt much better afterwards.
The patient reported increased edema over the past few days
in her right below the knee amputation stump.

In [**Hospital3 **] the physicians were unable to give her
intravenous Lasix, because of failure to find a central
access and poor peripheral access.  They attempted to place a
central line in her right neck and subsequently failed.  The
left side of her neck and arm were being saved for an AV
shunt.  The patient was subsequently given intravenous Lasix
and Bumex 3 mg po times one.  On admission to the outside
hospital the patient was also found to be in atrial
fibrillation and she was given 0.5 mg of Digoxin times one.
On admission to the outside hospital the patient was also
found to have electrocardiogram changes consisting of .[**Street Address(2) 18425**] depression in 1, AVL and .[**Street Address(2) 1755**] elevation in lead 3, AVF
and T wave inversions in V4 through V6.  The patient also had
a troponin of 0.7, which was indeterminate.  The patient was
started on aspirin, Atenolol and IM Lasix, the doses of which
we do not know.

Subsequently the patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 **], because the physicians who took
care of her Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 73**] for cardiology, Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 805**] for
renal and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] her primary care physician were all from
[**Hospital1 69**].  The patient was still
complaining of shortness of breath on transfer to [**Hospital1 346**], however, she states that she was
feeling better then when she initially presented to [**Hospital3 9683**].  The patient states that her baseline is that she
has two pillow orthopnea minimally, however, recently she has
been short of breath even with sitting up and has been
complaining of increased leg edema.  The patient also
complains of some mild blood in the urine since the [**12-26**].  The patient denies any recent changes in her diet
or recently eating fast food or not taking her medications.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1.  Congestive heart failure NYHA
class four with an EF of 25 to 30%.  2.  Ischemic
cardiomyopathy.  3.  Hypertension.  4.  Noninsulin dependent
diabetes mellitus for forty years complicated by peripheral
vascular disease, neuropathy and nephropathy.  5.  Peripheral
vascular disease status post right above the knee amputation.
6.  Chronic renal insufficiency with a baseline creatinine of
approximately 3 for the last three years.  7.  Coronary
artery disease status post myocardial infarction in [**2099**].  8.
Asthma.  9.  Gastroesophageal reflux disease.  10.  The
patient is status post cholecystectomy.  11.  Anemia status
post gastric bypass procedure.

MEDICATIONS ON TRANSFER FROM OUTSIDE HOSPITAL:  1.  Atenolol
50 mg once a day.  2.  Lovenox 100 mg twice a day.  3.
Lipitor 10 mg once a day.  4.  Neurontin 600 mg three times a
day.  5.  Erythropoietin 5000 units subQ Monday and Thursday.
6.  Imdur 60 mg once a day.  7.  Prevacid 30 mg once a day.
8.  NPH insulin 15 units subQ in the morning.  9.  Flovent
110 mcg two puffs b.i.d.  10.  Aspirin 325 mg once a day.
11.  Regular insulin sliding scale.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs, blood pressure 137/65.
Pulse 68 and regular.  Temperature 98.6.  Respiratory rate
20.  Oxygen saturation was 94% on 2 liters nasal cannula.  In
general, the patient appeared her stated age and was in
moderate respiratory distress.  HEENT pupils are equal, round
and reactive to light.  There was jugulovenous distention.
There were no carotid bruits appreciated.  Oropharynx was
clear.  Mucous membranes are moist.  Cardiac, normal S1 and
S2.  There was a positive S3.  Regular rate and rhythm.  2
out of 6 systolic murmur appreciated best at the left upper
sternal border with radiation to the apex.  Lung examination,
there were crackles bilaterally two thirds up both lung
fields.  There were no wheezes and no rhonchi.  Abdomen had
multiple abdominal scars, soft, nontender, obese and bowel
sounds were present, which were normoactive.  Extremities,
the patient is status post right above the knee amputation
with 2 to 3+ pitting edema in the stump as well as 2 to 3+
edema in the lower extremity up to her knee.  She also had an
excoriated scar on her left lower extremity, which was
approximately 2 cm by 2 cm, which was in the process of
healing.

LABORATORY VALUES ON ADMISSION:  White blood cell count was
9.2, hemoglobin 11.4, hematocrit 36, platelets 234, PT 12.1,
PTT 30, INR 0.93, potassium 5.1, chloride 115, bicarb 25, BUN
69, creatinine 3.6, blood glucose 187, calcium 8.5, CK 44,
troponin 0.7.  Chest x-ray showed congestive heart failure
with severe interstitial edema pattern.  Chest x-ray on the
30th at [**Hospital1 **] showed pulmonary vascular
congestion and bilateral pleural effusions consistent with
congestive heart failure.  Cardiac catheterization in [**2098**]
showed ostial left anterior descending coronary artery 60%
lesion, mid left anterior descending coronary artery 60%
lesion, subtotal occlusion of obtuse marginal two, total
occlusion of the proximal right coronary artery and EF of 35%
at the time.  Electrocardiogram at the outside hospital
showed T wave inversion in V4 through V6, .[**Street Address(2) 1755**] depression
in 1 and AVL and .[**Street Address(2) 1755**] elevation in 3 and AVF.
Electrocardiogram at [**Hospital1 69**] on
the 30th showed normal sinus rhythm at 72 beats per minute
and was unchanged from prior electrocardiogram.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  1.  Cardiovascular:  The patient was ruled
out for an ischemic event by cardiac enzymes.  The first CPK
was 43, second 51.  Troponin was 0.4.  Given the fact that
cardiac enzymes had been cycled at the outside hospital, no
further enzymes were drawn.  She was initially given po
diuretics, however, until a PICC line was placed on the first
of [**Month (only) 359**], which allowed for intravenous Lasix and for
further diuresis.  The patient diuresed well with 120 mg of
Lasix intravenously b.i.d.  She had approximately 3 to 4
liters net urine output over the first week of admission.

Subsequently she felt much symptomatic relief and
echocardiogram done on the first of [**Month (only) 359**] showed left
atrium, which was mildly dilated, left ventricular cavity,
which was mildly dilated.  Overall left ventricular systolic
function was severely depressed with an estimated ejection
fraction of 30%  There was moderate to severe global left
ventricular hypokinesis especially involving the lateral and
posterior walls.  The ascending aorta was mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets were mildly thickened.  There was
mild 1+ mitral regurgitation.  There was no pericardial
effusion.  The left atrium was 4.2 cm slightly above normal
of less then 4.0 cm.  The left atrium four chamber length was
6.1 slightly above the normal of less then 5.2.  With the
aggressive diuresis unfortunately the patient also developed
worsening of her renal insufficiency as evidenced by the
slowly increasing creatinine throughout this admission.

Given her extensive history of three vessel disease the
patient underwent a stress test on the [**12-5**], which
was a Persantine thallium stress test.  She achieved a 48% of
her maximal heart rate.  The Persantine MIBI
