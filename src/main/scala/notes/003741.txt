intubation and mechanical ventilation


History of Present Illness:
43 year-old male with PMH of CAD, [**Hospital **] transferred from the MICU.
Originally, presented with after a week of flu like illness with
altered mental status and thought to have seroquel OD (prior OD
on CCB/BB). Intubated at [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] for airway protection. Of
note, U Tox, S Tox are negative. (though were + for TCA at OSH).

However, it was determined that no meds were missing when
partner counted them. Therefore, episode of altered mental
status is not completely understood. While in the MICU,
patient's sedation was lightened and he self extubated. An LP
was performed for HAs and showed xanthochromia in all 4 tubes.
to exclude possibility of a traumatic tap, LP was repeated and
showed 3550 RBCs in tube 4 without any microorganisms. This was
concerning for SAH vs herpes vs mycotic aneurysm. PCR for HSV is
currently pending. CTA was performed on day of transfer and read
pending at time of this note. MRI spine was ordered to rule out
aneurysm/AVM but patient could not tolerate the procedure
secondary to nausea. He now feels back to normal in terms of his
thinking and fairly decent in terms of his mood. However, he
continues to experience vertigo and nausea especially when he
lays flat. Patient now without headaches.

Past Medical History:
Past Medical History:
1. CAD- s/p multiple stents with stent to LAD, pRCA, RCA, D1,
mid LCX at various times within the past 8 months. Cath [**2108-4-13**]
showed no flow limiting disease with EF=50%. 6 caths since [**11-20**].
His outpatient cardiologist notes that he has a severe coronary
vasculopathy (based on his having quickly developed seperate
coronary occlusions in rapid succession; this is why the stents
were each inserted on seperate occassions; this is also in the
context of presently having clear coronaries)
2. Hypertension
3. Hyperlipidemia
4. Tremor--essential
5. s/p hernia repair

PCP is [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]. Cardiologist is [**Doctor Last Name 5293**] at [**Hospital1 18**].

intoxicated (reported on this interview), OD ~10 years ago
(noted to SW), OD about 2 months ago leading to MICU admit and
OD on Benadryl also leading to brief MICU admit.

Has had ECT since [**2108-5-17**], which has
been helpful. Was receiving maintenance therapy once per week

CXR: 1.9
IMPRESSION: Appropriate placement of endotracheal tube and
nasogastric tube. Prominence of the pulmonary vasculature likely
relates to patient position.

CXR:[**11-27**]
FINDINGS: The patient has been extubated. There is a left-sided
subclavian central venous catheter with the tip in the upper to
mid SVC. Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes appear within
normal limits. No focal pulmonary opacities, pleural effusions,
or evidence of pneumothorax. Osseous structures appear
unremarkable.

CT HEAD: [**11-26**]
FINDINGS: There is no sign for the presence of an intracranial
hemorrhage, mass effect, or shift of normally midline
structures. There is no evidence for minor or major vascular
territory infarction. The density values of the brain parenchyma
are normal. There is no overt extracranial pathology seen other
than mild bilateral ethmoid sinus mucosal thickening.

MR HEAD [**11-27**]
FINDINGS: The right vertebral artery distal to the origin of the
right posterior inferior cerebellar artery is extremely
hypoplastic. Additionally, there are bilateral fetal-type
posterior cerebral arteries, the latter finding presumably
correlating with the rather diminutive basilar artery. Within
the limitations of MR angiography, there is no definite sign for
the presence of an aneurysm, although conventional angiography
remains the standard study necessary to more unequivocal
exclusion of this
