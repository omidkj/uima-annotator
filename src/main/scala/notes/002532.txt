Service:  Cardiothoracic Surgery

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  The patient seen in preoperative Cardiac
Surgery Clinic and found to be short of breath.  Admitted to
the Medicine Service for preoperative workup.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 36-year-old
gentleman with a history of type 1 diabetes complicated by
end-stage renal disease, status post failed renal transplant
in [**2137**] (on hemodialysis three times per week) with deep
venous thrombosis (status post bilateral below-knee
amputations) and retinopathy.

The patient had a recent admission in [**2140-12-29**] with
dyspnea on exertion and was found to have severe aortic
stenosis.  The patient was discharged home with plans to have
aortic valve replacement by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 70**] at a future
date.

A dental examination determined the need for dental
extractions in preparation for his aortic valve replacement.
The patient was discharged home with two weeks of clindamycin
and vancomycin.  However, the patient did not take his
antibiotics.

Five days prior to admission, the patient was admitted to
[**Hospital3 7362**] for fevers.  He was given antibiotics and left
that facility against medical advice because no doctor came
to see him for an entire day.

On the day of admission, the patient was seen in the clinic.
In Dr.[**Name (NI) 27686**] office, the patient look unwell with
complaints of dyspnea and was directly admitted to the
Medicine Service.

Initial vital signs revealed the patient had a temperature of
101.5 degrees Fahrenheit.

ALLERGIES:

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient states he quit tobacco one week
ago.  No alcohol use.  He lives in an apartment by himself.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Vital signs revealed
his temperature was 101.6 degrees Fahrenheit, his heart rate
was 90 (sinus), his blood pressure was 130/80, his
respiratory rate was 18, and his oxygen saturation was 99% on
room air.  In general, a young male who was alert and
oriented.  In no acute distress.  Head, eyes, ears, nose, and
throat examination revealed the left pupil round and reactive
to light.  The right pupil was dilated.  Slightly asymmetric
pupils.  The mucous membranes were moist.  No oropharyngeal
abscesses or lesions.  The neck was supple.  There was no
lymphadenopathy.  There was no pulsus paradox.  Respiratory
examination revealed the lungs were clear to auscultation
bilaterally.  Cardiovascular examination revealed a harsh [**5-4**]
holosystolic murmur with radiation to the carotids
bilaterally.  The abdomen was soft, nontender, and
nondistended.  There were normal active bowel sounds.  There
was no hepatosplenomegaly.  The patient had a papular rash to
his neck with pustules.  The extremities were warm.
Bilateral below-knee amputations with well-healed wounds.
Right subclavian dialysis catheter was nontender.  A few
pustules beneath the Tegaderm.

PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:  White blood
cell count was 16, his hematocrit 42.5, and his platelets
were 245.  His sodium was 134, potassium was 5.1, chloride
was 95, bicarbonate was 25, blood urea nitrogen was 46,
creatinine was 6.7, and blood glucose was 135.

BRIEF SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was seen by
the Medicine Service as well, as the Infectious Disease
Service, the Cardiology Service, and the Renal Service.

The patient was treated for approximately 10 days
preoperatively in an effort to determine the source of his
fevers and to treat his hyperglycemia with an anion gap.

Ultimately, on [**1-30**], the patient was transferred to the
Medical Intensive Care Unit with elevated blood sugars to
665, but no acidosis, and a minimal anion gap.  The initial
diagnosis was felt to more HHNK rather than diabetic
ketoacidosis.

The patient continued to be followed by the Critical Care
Service, the Renal Service, [**Last Name (un) **] Service, Medicine Service,
as well as Cardiology Service.  Finally, on [**2-5**], it
was felt that the patient's condition had improved enough to
go to the operating room.

On [**2-6**], the patient was brought to the operating room.
Please see the Operative Report for full details.  In
summary, the patient had a minimally invasive aortic valve
replacement with a 21-mm mosaic porcine bioprosthetic valve.
The patient tolerated the procedure well and was transferred
from the operating room to the Cardiothoracic Intensive Care
Unit.

The patient had a fair amount of bleeding from his chest tube
following his surgery.  The patient was treated with multiple
units of packed red blood cells as well as some fresh frozen
plasma and platelets.  He arrived to the Cardiothoracic
Intensive Care Unit on milrinone, Neo-Synephrine, and insulin
drips.  He did well in the immediate postoperative period.
His Neo-Synephrine was quickly weaned to off, and he became
hypertensive requiring nitroglycerin and Nipride infusions to
maintain a systolic blood pressure below 140 mmHg.

Given the patient's chest tube output the decision was made
to keep him sedated until the morning on postoperative day
one.  However, he was weaned to continuous positive airway
pressure [**5-3**] on the day of surgery.  He also underwent
hemodialysis following this surgery.

On postoperative day one, the patient remained
hemodynamically stable on low-dose milrinone, nitroglycerin,
and Nipride infusions.  He was successfully extubated.
Again, he received hemodialysis.  His mediastinal chest tubes
were discontinued.

On postoperative day two, the patient was started on beta
blockade as well as an ACE inhibitor.  His Nipride was weaned
to off, and his nitroglycerin was also weaned.

On postoperative day three, the patient was also started on
Norvasc, his ACE inhibitor, and beta blockade.  The doses
were gradually increased.  His remaining chest tubes were
discontinued.  However, the patient remained in the Intensive
Care Unit for the next several days because of a remaining
need for intravenous insulin infusions.  Upon the
recommendations of the [**Hospital **] Clinic, the patient was begun
on glargine.  Finally, on postoperative day five, the patient
was able to come off of his insulin drip and was transferred
to [**Hospital Ward Name 121**] Two for continued postoperative care and cardiac
rehabilitation.

Over the next several days, the patient's insulin regimen
continued to be modified.  He was returned to his
preoperative hemodialysis schedule.  He continued to be
followed by the Infectious Disease Service.

Finally, on postoperative day 19, it was felt that that the
patient would be stable and ready for transfer to
rehabilitation on the following morning.

At the time of this dictation, the patient's physical
examination was as follows.  Vital signs revealed his
temperature was 98.4 degrees Fahrenheit, his heart
