Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1505**]
Chief Complaint:
shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2101-5-10**] 1. Redo sternotomy.
2. Redo coronary artery bypass surgery x2, with a left
    internal mammary artery graft to the left anterior
    descending and reversed saphenous vein graft to the

History of Present Illness:
88 yo F s/p CABGx3 in [**2101**] Medical Center with complaints of occasional

Pertinent Results:
Pre Bypass: Patient is AV paced at baseline. The left atrium is
moderately dilated. The left atrium is elongated. The right
atrium is moderately dilated. No atrial septal defect is seen by
2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are
normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. There is
moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
Septal hypo/dyskinesis (difficult to interepret in the setting
of pacing), anterior and anteroseptal severe hypokiensis.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is moderately
depressed (LVEF= 35 %). Right ventricular chamber size and free
wall motion are normal. There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the
aortic root. There are simple atheroma in the ascending aorta.
There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the aortic arch. There are
complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. The
aortic valve leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. There is
critical aortic valve stenosis (valve area <0.8cm2). Trace
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
moderately thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate [2+]
tricuspid regurgitation with some redundnacy of leaflets is
seen.

Post Bypass: Patient is AV paced on epinepherine and
phenylepherine. There is a tissue valve in the aortic position
with a small perivalvular leak which does not change after
protamine. No AI, peak gradients 10-18mm hg. No change in
biventricular function. Aortic contours intact. Remaining exam
is unchanged. All findings discussed with surgeons at the time
of the exam.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the hospital and brought to the
operating room on [**2101-5-10**] where the patient underwent redo
sternotomy, CABG x 2 and aortic valve replacement.  Overall the
patient tolerated the procedure well and post-operatively was
transferred to the CVICU in stable condition for recovery and
invasive monitoring.  Cefazolin was used for surgical antibiotic
prophylaxis.  Within 24 hours the patient was extubated, alert
and oriented and breathing comfortably.  The patient was
neurologically intact.  Vasopressor support was weaned by POD 2,
beta blocker was initiated and the patient was gently diuresed
toward the preoperative weight.  The patient was transferred to
the telemetry floor for further recovery.  Chest tubes and
pacing wires were discontinued without complication.  The
patient's permanent pacer was interrogated by the
electrophysiology service.  Coumadin and amiodarone were started
for atrial fibrillation.  Simvastatin dose was decreased on
initiation of amiodarone.  The patient was evaluated by the
physical therapy service for assistance with strength and
mobility.  By the time of discharge on POD 8 the patient was
ambulating freely, the wound was healing and pain was controlled
with oral analgesics.  The patient was discharged to rehab on IV
lasix and telemetry, in good condition with appropriate follow
up instructions.
