[**2104-7-1**] CT Abd/Pelv:
IMPRESSION:
1.  Extensive subcutaneous emphysema. 2.  Right chest tube
within the subcutaneous air and not within the pleural space. 3.
 Small right pleural pneumothorax. 4.  Trace bilateral
hemothoraces. 5.  Trace pneumomediastinum. 6.  Trace complex
perihepatic fluid without evidence of injury to the solid
organs. 7.  Right third through tenth and left fourth through
eighth rib fractures.  Sternal fracture. 8.  Small subcutaneous
hematoma overlying the right upper abdomen. 9.  Loss of height
of the L4 vertebral body, likely chronic. 10.  Complex splenic
cyst. 11.  Apparent soft tissue lesion with dense calcifications
in the region of the right anterior mediastinum, not clearly
evaluated on this exam.  After the acute findings have resolved,
recommend followup with dedicated chest CT for further
evaluation. 12.  Findings suggestive of chronic pancreatitis
with possible obstructing calculus in the distal pancreatic duct
within the pancreatic head. An MRCP can be obtained for further
evaluation.

CT Head:
IMPRESSION:
No acute intracranial abnormality.

[**2104-7-4**] Echo: Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and
overall systolic function are normal (LVEF 65%). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
However, in very suboptimal imaging, the basal segment of the
posterior wall may be hypokineticThere is no aortic valve
stenosis. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with
trivial mitral regurgitation. The pulmonary artery systolic
pressure could not be determined. There is a very small
pericardial effusion. There is an anterior space which most
likely represents a prominent fat pad. There are no
echocardiographic signs of tamponade.

Brief Hospital Course:
59F s/p MVC partially restrained passenger, front seat, car vs
crowd and then a pole, -[**Hospital 63213**] transferred from OSH via med
flight, neck cleared at OSH. Pt was hypotensive in the CT scan,
triggered was called, pt received 1 U PRBC. CT was found to be
placed in chest wall subcutaneous tissue. She was stable until
arrival in the TICU when she began to have respiratory distress
and was intubated, sedated and is paralyzed. CT scan shows to
have numerous rib fractures, sternal fx, Sub-Q emphysema,
pneumomediastinum, and R PTX. R anterior chest pigtail was
placed initially but it was not resolved her PTX. Bilateral CT
were then placed in the TSICU. On [**7-5**]+ gram negative
diplococci was detected on SCx.Cultures grew w/ Moraxella.
Vanco/Cipro/Cefepime started. Bedside trach was placed on [**7-7**].
On [**7-9**], pt was doing well, +OOB to chair, b/l CT to waterseal.
On [**7-10**]: Left sided chest tube D/c'd. Mental status starts to
improve. [**7-11**]: dobhoff placed. R Chest tube dc'd. On [**7-13**], Pt
was weaned to trach mask and she passed bedside swallow
evaluation. Pt was advanced to regular diet with supplements.
