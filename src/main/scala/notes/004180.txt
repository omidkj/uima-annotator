Imaging
TTE [**9-24**]:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is
unusually small. Left ventricular systolic function is
hyperdynamic (EF>75%). Right ventricular chamber size and free
wall motion are normal. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No
aortic regurgitation is seen. Trivial mitral regurgitation is
seen. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be
determined. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Small, hypertrophied left ventricle with
hyperdynamic biventricular systolic function.
.
CXR [**9-24**]:
FINDINGS:  ET tube to be 6.5 cm  above the carina; retrocardiac
opacity likely represents atelectasis. No pneumothorax
.
CXR [**9-26**]: post-extubation
FINDINGS: bilateral atelectasis that is unchanged in extent.
Mild fluid overload might be present, no larger pleural
effusions.  Unchanged borderline size of the cardiac silhouette.

.
CTA chest [**9-24**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
2. Status post right upper lobectomy for non-small cell lung
cancer.
Moderate emphysema in the left upper lobe.
3. Stellate opacity in the left upper lobe may represent sequela
of chronic change, however, focal lesion cannot be entirely
excluded given history.  Recommend correlation with prior exams
once available and short-term followup if prior exams are not
available.
4. Bibasilar dependent atelectasis, left greater than right.
Concurrent
infection in the left lower lobe cannot be entirely excluded in
the
appropriate clinical setting.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 26075**] is a 58 y/o M with newly diagnosed rectal cancer s/p
low anterior resection with end ileostomy whose intraoperative
course was complicated by hypotension requiring continued
intubation and care in the ICU. He was reliant on pressors
overnight but was weaned successfully and was maintaining good
blood pressures within the next post-operative day. He was also
successfully weaned to extubate this same day, and was
tolerating a sips before transitioning to floor bed status.  An
intra-operative ECHO at the time showed no pericardial effusion,
embolus or other significant abnormality; EF was preserved at
75%. A CT-angiogram of the chest also did not show any acute
changes, including that of pulmonary embolus or other etiology
to explain his intraoperative hypotension.

By system:
Neuro: Post-operatively, the patient received Dilaudid IV/PCA,
TAP blocks (Pain service), and ativan with good effect and
adequate pain control. When tolerating oral intake, the patient
was transitioned to oral pain medications.

CV: As mentioned earlier, the patient developed intraoperative
hypotension requiring pressors and 5L of crystalloid and 1L of
albumin but was weaned off them soon thereafter with some
residual tachycardia with normal blood pressure that resolved
with beta-blockade. As noted earlier, his ECHO demonstrated no
clear etiology to his hypotension. The patient was placed back
on his metoprolol and while on the floor the subsequent few
days, was stable from a cardiovascular standpoint with a HR in
the 80s-90s and SBP within normal range. His vital signs were
routinely monitored via telemetry.

Pulmonary: The patient was stable from a pulmonary standpoint;
vital signs were routinely monitored. As cited, his chest
CT-angiogram was negative for pulmonary embolus.  He was
extubated POD#1, and maintained good oxygen saturations on nasal
cannula in the upper 90's as well as without additional O2
requirement upon discharge. His vital signs were monitored
routinely.

GI/GU: Post-operatively, the patient was given IV fluids until
tolerating oral intake. His diet was advanced when appropriate,
which was tolerated well. He initially experienced some lower
urine output POD #3 but responded soon afterwards with a
combination of auto-diuresis and a one-time dose of furosemide.
His foley was removed on POD#4, with no retention issues. Intake
and output were closely monitored. He was discharged on flomax
daily and to continue it unless otherwise directed at clinic
follow-up or subsequent future appointments.

Endo: The patient's blood glucose was initially in the 300s on
POD#1, at which point he was started on lantus in the evening
alongside his sliding scale of insulin. His sugars normalized to
the mid 100s prior to discharge on both lantus and sliding scale
insulin.  He was discharged home on his oral diabetic
medications.

ID: The patient's temperature was closely watched for signs of
infection, no post-operative antibiotics were required.

Prophylaxis: The patient received subcutaneous heparin during
this stay, and was encouraged to get up and ambulate as early as
possible.

Other: given the nodularity of the patient's liver
intra-operatively as well as his post-operative tachycardia,
alcohol dependence and withdrawal was entertained as a factor.
However, the patient did not score significantly on his CIWA
scale; he did not require any additional ativan besides that for
his pain throughout his admission for withdrawal symptoms.

At the time of discharge on POD#5, the patient was doing well,
afebrile with stable vital signs, tolerating a regular diet,
ambulating, voiding without assistance, and pain was well
controlled.
