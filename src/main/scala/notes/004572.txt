Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 443**]
Chief Complaint:
dyspnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Pacemaker placement


History of Present Illness:
This is a 81 YOM with known CAD who presents with dyspnea. He
saw his primary care yesterday with out significant event. He
takes his own pulse frequently and states it has been in the 80s
and regular. Today he felt suddenly short of breath with
exertion. He also felt dizzy. He laid down and his symptoms
resolved. He had no chest pain or palpitations.  Recently had
hospital stay for spine surgery complicated by urinary
retention. During that hospital stay he was found to have an
atrial tachycardia. He was DCCV to sinus brady. He then
developed symptomatic bradycardia. His beta blocker and
amiodarone were transiently held. He is now off amio. His beta
blocker dose was recently doubled.
.
In the ED he was found to be in a wide complex ventricular
rhythm with rate of 35 bpm. He was given 2.5L of NS and 3 baby
aspirin.


Past Medical History:
1. Coronary disease s/p CABG x4 in [**2090**]
- NSTEMI [**12-19**]
2. Hypertension
3. Hypercholesterolemia
4. Diabetes mellitus
5. Chronic kidney disease
6. Back surgery 1 week ago for spinal stenosis
7. Atrial fibrillation on coumadin

Social History:
He lives at home with his wife. [**Name (NI) **] has three children. He is a
retired auto body man.  No EtOH or ivdu. He quit smoking about
45 years ago.


Family History:
He has two brothers with CAD, one who died of SCD.


Physical Exam:
Blood pressure was 85/46 mm Hg while seated. Pulse was 36
beats/min and regular, respiratory rate was 12 breaths/min.
Generally the patient was well developed, well nourished and
well groomed. The patient was oriented to person, place and
time. The patient's mood and affect were not inappropriate.
.
There was no xanthalesma and conjunctiva were pink with no
pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa. The neck was supple with
JVD.  There were no chest wall deformities, scoliosis or
kyphosis. The respirations were not labored and there were no
use of accessory muscles. Bilateral crackles at the bases.
.
Palpation of the heart revealed the PMI to be located in the 5th
intercostal space, mid clavicular line. There were no thrills,
lifts or palpable S3 or S4. The heart sounds revealed profound
bradycardia with a normal S1 and the S2 was normal. There were
no rubs, murmurs, clicks or gallops.
There was no hepatosplenomegaly or tenderness. The abdomen was
soft nontender and nondistended. The extremities had no pallor,
cyanosis, clubbing or edema. There were no abdominal, femoral or
carotid bruits. Inspection and/or palpation of skin and
subcutaneous tissue showed no stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars,

or xanthomas.
.
Pulses:
Right: Carotid 2+ Femoral 2+ Popliteal 2+ DP 2+ PT 2+
Left: Carotid 2+ Femoral 2+ Popliteal 2+ DP 2+ PT 2+


Pertinent Results:
EKG demonstrated bradycardia rate 35 bpm. nl axis. long qrs. No
ST changes or TWI. No atrial activity seen.
.
TELEMETRY demonstrated: bradycardia
.
2D-ECHOCARDIOGRAM performed on [**2102-5-19**] demonstrated:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated. There is severe symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Tissue
Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling
pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). There is no left ventricular outflow
obstruction at rest or with Valsalva. Right ventricular chamber
size and free wall motion are normal. There is abnormal septal
motion/position consistent with right ventricular
pressure/volume overload. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are
mildly thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis. Trace
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate [2+]
tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

.
CXR: Portable chest radiograph was compared to [**2102-5-24**].
No
significant pulmonary edema. The cardiac and mediastinal
contours are both remarkable for stable cardiomegaly and
tortuous thoracic aorta. Patient is status post median
sternotomy with coronary bypass grafting. The lungs are clear.

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 81 YOM with CAD s/p CABG x4 in [**2090**], Afib on coumadin,
DM, HTN, HL, CKD (Cr 1.4-1.6), s/p recent spine surgery p/w DOE,
dizziness, found to be bradycardic in 30s with junctional escape
rhythm and acute on chronic renal failure, a temporary pacemaker
was placed as a bridge to a permanent pacemaker. He tolerated
the procedure well. His BP medications for adjusted and he was
discharged home.
.
1)Bradycardia - The patient had a hx in the distant past of
bradycardia in setting
of dig toxicity. However, he was currently not taking digoxin.
His Bradycardia was likely due to conduction disease and a
recent increased dose of beta blocker. His beta blocker was held
and a temporary pacing wire was placed (AAI). HE also had recent
atrial tachycardia, thus the decisison was made to place a PPM
for tachy/brady syndrome. His coumadin was held and he was
maintained on a heparin GTT. He tolerated the procedure well.
After placement of the PPM, he had episode of tachycardia (c/w
atrial tach), we re-started BB and and added CCB for optimal BP
and HR control.
.
2)Acute on chronic renal failure - the patient has a Cr baseline
around 1.4-1.6. He presented with a crt. of 2.5. Initially his
ARF was thought likely due to increased diuresis. However, on
exam he seemed volume overloaded and receiving Lasix prn.  His
creatinine gradually trended back to baseline during his stay.

3)Afib - On coumadin prior to admission.  Coumadin was held and
a heparin drip was started until all procedures were done. He
was discharged on his home coumadin dose.
.
4)Hyperlipidemia - cont statin

5)DM - Continue glipizide. RISS.
