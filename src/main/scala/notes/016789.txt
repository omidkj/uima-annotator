History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 89394**] is a 74 y/o M w/h/o ILD, COPD, chronic
hydropneumothorax, initially diagnosed on [**2186-4-10**], and AVNRT,
who presents on transfer from [**Hospital3 **] with pleural
space
infection.
He had a spontaneous PTX on [**2186-4-10**], treated intially with CT
drainage, however he had a continued airleak requiring a VATS
pleurectomy and pleurodesis, with an oversewing of his airleak
on
[**2186-4-24**] by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  His air leak persisted requiring a
repeat talc pleurodesis on [**2186-4-30**].  He was sent home initially
but was readmitted to the OSH from [**Date range (1) 31152**] for an MSSA wound
infection and expanding PTX, he had his old chest tubes removed
and a new one put in during this hospitalization that has
remained in place since.  He was readmitted from [**Date range (1) 29219**] for
fever and SVT, during which his sputum tested positive for MAC,
but his pleural fluid did not grow any culture.  Due to his SVT,
his was changed from atenolol to sotalol then.  He notes that he
has been having a [**Date range (1) 269**] come to his house since his last
hospitalization packing his old chest tube sites with wet to dry
dressings since they are not healing well. For the previous 3-4
weeks he has noticed cloudy drainage from his chest tube, he
returned to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]  2 days PTA who prescribed keflex.
Yesterday AM he had a fever to 103, palpitations and shortness
of
breath and returned to [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] where he was noted to be in
AVNRT, tachycardic to 171.  He was administered adenosine
causing
this to break.  In adition he was given vancomycin and zosyn.
Labs there revealed a wbc ct of 20.4.  He was transfered here
for
further management of his pleural space infection, his chronic
hydropneumothorax and his SVT.
On arrival here he notes no chest pain, SOB or palpitations.
+fevers/chills.  + chronic cough, non productive.  No
hemoptysis.
No HA/N/V.

CXR: [**2186-8-11**]: Large right-sided hydropneumothorax has not
changed in size since exam performed about 24 hours ago. The
left lung shows reticular opacity consistent with chronic
interstitial disease. The left hemidiaphragm is obscured,
probably secondary to left lower lobe atelectasis/interstitial
disease. There is no evidence of pneumothorax or pleural
effusion in the left hemithorax. The cardiomediastinal contour
is stable compared with prior exam with no evidence of
mediastinal deviation.

A left-sided PICC is observed in a stable position and ends in
the upper superior vena cava.

IMPRESSION: Right-sided hydropneumothorax and chronic
interstitial lung
disease without displacement of the mediastinum.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 89394**] presented  to [**Hospital1 18**] with shortness of breath. He was
admitted to the ICU as a transfer from an outside hospital. On
arrival he was returned to SVT requiring adenosine, pacer pads
were placed and he was started on a diltiazem drip initially.
Cardiology was consulted and after patient became bradycardic on
the diltiazem they recommended digoxin .5mg IV over 30 minutes
once and then a second time after six hours. Then digoxin 0.25mg
IV once and then 0.25mg PO daily from there on. His sotalol was
held and he had was controlled on this regimen. He also had a
right sided pleural pigtail placed on [**2186-7-28**].

# Neuro- Stable throughout hospitalization. Required no pain
medications, maintained airway and was oriented x3 throughout
stay.

# Pulm- Chronic pulmonary infection s/p VATS
pleurectomy/pleurodesis on [**4-7**] and pleurodesis on [**5-8**] who
presented  with apical chest tube in right chest placed [**2186-6-8**],
with purulent drainage and ongoing air leak. On [**2186-7-28**] a right
basilar pigtail was placed at the bedside through ultrasound
guidance. Purulent drainage was noted but no air leak initially.
Serial chest x-rays revealed persistent loculation treated with
TPA x 3 days with resolution of fluid collections confirmed by
CCT on [**2186-8-5**]. His respiratory status improved with oxygen
saturations of 96-99% on room air from requiring 3-4LNC. A
persistent leak remained. On [**2097-8-3**] he was taken to the OR by
interventional pulmonology and had bronchoscopy in an attempt to
find the source of the leak with hopeful one way valve
placement, but no source could be found. On [**2186-8-5**] he began
having clamp trials of his chest tube. His respiratory status
remained stable with oxygen saturations of 92-96% on room air at
rest and 89-91% with ambulation. On [**2186-8-7**] his chest tube leak
was noted to be reduced, although he had significant leak around
chest tube insertion site. The basilar chest tube was removed
and skin closed with 2.0 silk. The pigtail was removed [**2186-8-9**].

Chest films: serial chest films showed stable large right
pneumothorax.

# CV- Initially was transferred to unit after episode  of
supraventricular tachycardia that was thought to be AVNRT, which
patient had at outside hospital. He had a heart into the 200's,
and was hypotensive (SBP 60-80s), was given adenosine x1 and
then started on a diltiazem drip that was titrated up to
20mcg/hr. On this drip he became hypotensive and  so per
cardiology was taken off the diltiazem drip and started on
digoxin IV 0.50mg Q6 x2 then transition ed to digoxin 0.25mg PO
daily and had no further events. Patient was kept on telemetry
throughout. He did not have any additional episodes of
significant ectopy through hospital stay. Echocardiogram done
[**2186-7-28**] global systolic function are normal (LVEF 65%). Due to
suboptimal technical
