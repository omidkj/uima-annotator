CXR (prelim read): PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH: Cardiac and
mediastinal contours appear stable allowing for low lung
volumes. Pulmonary vascularity is within normal limits. There
are no focal consolidations or pleural effusions. Persistent
streaky opacity in the left mid lung is again identified, likely
representing
residual scar or atelectasis from the previously seen airspace
disease.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process.
Persistent streaky opacity in the left lung likely representing
atelectasis, or scar from prior infection.
.
CTA chest (wet read): No PE. Increased opacity in region of left
upper lobe scar/cavity, concerning for possible superimposed
infection, or scar carcinoma. opacity in left bronchus possibly
blood or secretion. evidence of fluid overload.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 58yo M with ESRD on PD, h/o E.coli pneumonia resulting in
LUL scar p/w hemotpysis and hypoxia.
.
1) Hemoptysis:  The patient was admitted with hemoptysis. He was
admitted to the medical service and was stable overnight. On the
morning of [**5-24**] he had another episode of hemoptysis. He was
taken to the IP suite for bronchoscopy where he was found to
have large clot in the apico-posterior segment of his left upper
lobe. BAL/wash from the LUL was performed and sent for gram
stain & culture, fungal culture, and cytology. No intervention
was performed due to concern for bleeding. He was transferred to
the MICU for closer monitoring. He underwent a embolization of
the artery in LUL under IR and tolerated procedure well. Pt was
stable for transer to medical service. Hematocrit stable at ~29,
compared to most recent value in OMR dated [**3-11**]. In terms of
understanding what may have precipitated bleeding into the
mainstem bronchus, there is some increased opacity in the LUL on
CT scan which may represent superimposed infection vs.
malignancy.  Patient also has a history of necrotizing pneumonia
with scarring in LUL; this may be a complication of chronic
scarring of this old lesion, causing in erosion of bronchial
artery, similar to [**Doctor Last Name **] aneurysm seen in TB patients.  At
time of presentation, patient was notably afebrile with normal
WBC, prompting some concern for malignancy in this gentleman
with a long smoking history. Gram stain from BAL with GPC and
GNR, also sputum culture with GPC so pt started on vanco and
levofloxacin-in setting of changes on CT asl well. The patient
stable
