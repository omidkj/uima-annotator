History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 8182**] is a 65-year-old gentleman with a complicated PMH
including CVA (nonverbal and does not move arms/legs at
baseline), afib on warfarin, h/o chronic aspiration and multiple
PNA (s/p trach/PEG [**3-/2200**]), multiple prior episodes of
UTI/urosepsis with drug-resistant organisms, C diff s/p
colectomy, DM2, PVD, and several recent admissions for
UTI/sepsis, who presents now with fever to 101, leukocytosis to
27.7, one episode of vomiting earlier today, and question of
aspiration. He was given a dose of tylenol in his nursing home
prior to transfer. He was brought to ED by ambulance from his
nursing home.
.
In the ED, initial vitals were 97.6 67 101/64 18 99% 2L.
Patient reported left chest pain as he is able to nod yes or no.
 Labs notable for WBC 23.7 with 87% N. UA showed mod leuk, tr
bld, neg nitr, 7 RBC, 101 WBC, mod bacteria, no epis. EKG was
sinus at 69, LAD, RBBB, c/w prior per report.  CXR revealed
infiltrates concerning for pneumonia.  He received broad
spectrum antibiotics including levaquin, vancomycin 1 gram, and
cefepime 2 grams.  He was initially assigned a floor bed, but
his BP dropped to mid 80's systolic.  A 18G was placed on the
right with a 20G on the left.  He was bolused with IVF for a
total of 3L.  Was admitted for treatment of PNA and UTI. Most
recent vitals prior to transfer were 64 101/64.
.
Of note, patient has had several recent admissions, including
admission to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] in [**2202-11-17**]/11 with urosepsis treated with
vancomycin and meropenem, and Medicine [**Date range (1) 80455**] with
UTI/sepsis treated with ceftriaxone and a right cold foot felt
to be secondary to vasospasm, that did not require [**Date range (1) **]
intervention. Patient received pain control, was seen by
Vascular surgery, and had return of palpable pulses during the
admission.
.
Upon arrival to the MICU, his vital signs were T 36.1, p 72, bp
116/67, r 11, 94% trach mask. On interview, he acknowledged that
he was in some discomfort but indicated that it was not in his
chest, abdomen, extremities, or genital area. Interview was
limited by his inability to respond beyond nodding yes/no, and
he was only responsive to very simple questions.

CXR [**2201-12-31**]:
New bibasilar opacities, with low lung volumes. Considerations
include pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting, but
atelectasis or even aspiration could be considered depending on
clinical circumstances.
.
[**1-3**] CXR:
FINDINGS: Tip of right PICC terminates in the lower superior
vena cava. The tip of the catheter is about 3.3 cm below the
level of the radiodense
guidewire, which terminates in the mid superior vena cava.
Tracheostomy tube remains in standard position. Stable
cardiomegaly, and improving pleural effusion and left basilar
atelectasis.
