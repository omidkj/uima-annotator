HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Fifty-three year old male with a
history of metastatic nonsmall lung cancer with metastasis to
the left femur and adrenals, who presents with progressive
shortness of breath over the past week.  The patient had a
chest x-ray done at his oncologist's office, which showed a
small apical pneumothorax, new pulmonary nodules, and an
enlarged cardiac silhouette.  Transthoracic echocardiogram
was performed which showed a moderate-to-large
circumferential pericardial effusion with impaired
ventricular filling.  The patient was sent to the Emergency
Department for triage to the Catheterization Laboratory for
pericardiocentesis.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Nonsmall cell lung cancer with metastasis to the left
femur and to the adrenals bilaterally.  It was initially
diagnosed in [**2111-11-24**] as an undifferentiated
mediastinal carcinoma of unknown primary.  The patient has
since had multiple courses of chemotherapy including the
following:  Cisplatin and etoposide x1 regimen; carboplatin
and Taxol x1 regimen; low dose carboplatin and Taxol with
concurrent radiation therapy.  The patient had a recent
diagnosis of a left femur bone metastasis and had radiation
therapy to this region.  The patient then had two cycles of
gemcitabine in [**2113-3-23**], a course of Iressa was started
and the patient continues on this regimen.
2. History of near syncope and dehydration requiring IV
fluids and .............
3. Diverticulosis.
4. Anxiety.
5. Orthostasis.
6. Internal hemorrhoids.

smoking tobacco in [**2111-3-24**].  Prior smoking history
includes 40 years of two packs per day leading to greater
than 80 pack year smoking history.  He denies alcohol use.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Significant for father with [**Name2 (NI) 499**] cancer and
his mother died of pneumonia.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  In general, this is an ill appearing
cachectic male appearing older than stated age in mild
respiratory distress.  Vital signs:  Temperature 98.8, heart
rate 100, blood pressure 111/65, respiratory rate 27, pulse
oximetry 97% on 5 liters.  HEENT is normocephalic,
atraumatic.  Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light
and accommodation.  Extraocular muscles are intact.
Anicteric sclerae.  Moist mucosal membranes.  Neck:  Jugular
venous pressure 6-7 cm, no lymphadenopathy, supple.  Lungs:
Dull breath sounds at the right base, clear to auscultation
on the left side with good breath sounds.  Heart:  Regular,
rate, and rhythm, normal S1, S2.  Abdomen is soft, nontender,
and nondistended, normoactive bowel sounds in all four
quadrants.  Extremities:  No edema, 2+ distal pulses
bilaterally, dorsalis pedis.

LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION:  White blood cell count 11.2,
84% neutrophils, 9% lymphocytes, 5% monocytes, and 0 bands.
Electrolytes:  Sodium 134, potassium 4.8, chloride 93,
bicarbonate 28, BUN 14, creatinine 0.7, glucose 97.
Pericardial fluid:  White blood cell count [**Pager number **], red blood
cell count [**Pager number **].  Differential of the white blood cell count
15 polys, 2 lymphocytes, 1 monocyte, 8 macrophages, and 2
other cells.  Total protein 5.6, glucose 113, LDH 279,
albumin 3.0.  PT 12.8, INR 1.1, PTT 28.8.

CHEST X-RAY:  Small left apical pneumothorax, new pulmonary
nodules most likely due to metastatic disease, enlargement of
the cardiac silhouette without interval change in pulmonary
vascularity.

ELECTROCARDIOGRAM:  Sinus tachycardia at 103 beats per
minute, normal axis, normal intervals, no pulsus alternans.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Patient was brought to the Catheterization
Laboratory on [**5-16**], where the following was noted:  A
low pressure tamponade was present with equalization of the
pericardial and right atrial pressures.  Cardiac index was
estimated at 2.2 liters per minute per meters squared.
pericardiocentesis was performed and 540 cc of clear fluid
was removed and sent for evaluation.  Pericardial drain was
left in place for close drainage.  The patient was then
admitted to the MICU, where his pericardial effusion drained
over the next three days.  This was confirmed by serial
echocardiography which did eventually show resolution of the
effusion on [**5-19**].

The patient remained hemodynamically stable throughout his
MICU stay.  He was maintained on 5 liters nasal cannula, but
did at times require increased O2 requirement, and was kept
in good respiratory status with consistent albuterol
nebulizer treatments every four hours.

On [**5-19**], the patient was transferred to the General
Medicine floor.  At that time he had moderate respiratory
distress and was again maintained in good respiratory status
with increased O2 administration and albuterol nebulizer
treatments standing for the first 24 hours and then prn after
that.  During the initial 24 hours on the floor, the patient
did require administration of oxygen via 100% nonrebreather
mask to make him more comfortable.

During the remainder of his stay, he did not require the
nonrebreather mask to maintain his O2 saturations, however,
it was decided that access to greater than 5 liters of
continuous O2 administration would be necessary if he were to
be discharged home.  Therefore, arrangements were made for a
liquid O2 tank with a nonrebreather mask for administration
of [**9-6**] liters prn be available at his home.

2. Patient's last echocardiography on [**5-19**] showed
resolution of the pericardial effusion.  There was no
evidence to suggest reaccumulation of the effusion.  The
patient did have mild tachycardia intermittently throughout
his hospital stay thought to be related to his poor
respiratory status.

3. Hematology/Oncology:  The patient was aware of his
terminal illness.  Comfort measures including pain control
and nausea control were continued throughout his hospital
stay in addition to administration of a nonrebreather mask of
100% O2 for improved controlled of respiratory distress.  The
patient was continued on Iressa as prescribed by his
oncologist.  The option for hospice services at home was
discussed with the patient, who said that he had considered
this option in the past, and would consider it again in the
near future after discussing the option with his family.  The
patient was fully aware of the stage of his disease and the
sites of metastasis of his lung cancer.

4. Fluids, electrolytes, and nutrition:  The patient had a
very poor nutritional status, however, he did tolerate high
protein shakes prepared by his family.

5. Pain:  His pain was controlled with Fentanyl patches and
IV Morphine prn for control of breakthrough pain.  During the
final 24 hours of his hospital stay, he required no
additional Morphine for control of his shoulder and leg pain.

6. Gastrointestinal:  Patient was continued on a bowel
regimen of laxatives and stool softeners to relieve the
constipation caused by his large narcotic doses.

7. Prophylaxis:  The patient was put on pneumoboots to
prevent DVT throughout his stay.

8. Disposition:  The patient was discharged to home on [**5-19**] with VNA services and with a new regimen for oxygen
administration including 3-6 liters of continuous oxygen
along with a liquid oxygen tank with a nonrebreather mask at
10-15 liters of oxygen as needed for comfort.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1. Pericardial effusion status post pericardiocentesis.
2. Stage IV nonsmall cell lung cancer with metastasis.
