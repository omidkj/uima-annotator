Admission Date:  [**2121-12-18**]     Discharge Date:


Service:  MICU/GREEN

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 81 year old
Caucasian male who was brought into the Emergency Department
for mental status changes and decreased p.o. intake.  The
patient was just recently admitted to the hospital for a
urinary tract infection and was treated with antibiotics.
The patient also complains of a recent fall and low back
pain.  Of note, the patient was a poor historian on his
admission to interviewer.  Therefore, the details of his
history of present illness are limited.  In addition to the
above symptoms, the patient also complains of increased
urinary frequency and nocturia.  The patient denies any loss
of consciousness or trauma to the head during his falls.  The
patient states he was not sure why he fell but felt that his
legs fell from under him.  Of note, the patient was started
on Ultram for several days prior to discharge.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Restrictive lung disease secondary to remote tuberculosis
infection, status post pleurectomy and decortication for
recurrent effusion.
2.  Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.
3.  Hypertension.
4.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
5.  Hypothyroidism.
6.  Mild atrial insufficiency,
7.  Glaucoma.
8.  History of urinary tract infection.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1.  Colace 100 mg twice a day.
2.  Captopril 12.5 mg p.o. three times a day.

4.  Coumadin 1 mg q.h.s.
5.  Amiodarone 200 mg once daily.
6.  Senna two tablets at bedtime as needed.
7.  Atrovent two puffs four times a day.
8.  Protonix 40 mg once daily.
9.  Ultram 25 mg p.o. three times a day as needed of pain.
10. Lactulose 30 three times a day.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission, vital signs revealed
temperature of 98.4, blood pressure 168/73, pulse 70,
respiratory rate 20, oxygen saturation 97% in room air.  In
general, the patient is in no apparent distress, alert but
not oriented and agitated.  Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat
examination - The pupils are equal, round, and reactive to
light and accommodation.  Mucous membranes are moist.  Sclera
anicteric.  Neck examination - There is no jugular venous
distention, and there is no nuchal rigidity.  Heart
examination - normal S1 and S2, II/VI systolic murmur.  No
rubs and no gallops.  Lungs - rales at the left base;
otherwise clear.  Abdominal examination is benign with a
negative stool occult blood test.   Extremities are cool to
touch, dorsalis pedis pulses and popliteal pulses were not
palpable.  Neurologic - The patient is agitated, not
oriented, confused.  The patient is yelling when no one is in
the room.

LABORATORY DATA:  On admission, complete blood count showed a
white blood cell count 15.2, 90% neutrophils and no bands,
hematocrit 46.2, platelet count 535,000.  Chem7 shows a
sodium of 131, potassium 5.8 though the sample was moderately
hemolyzed; otherwise the chemistries are normal.  Urinalysis
shows no evidence of urinary tract infection.

Chest x-ray is unchanged with no evidence of infection.  Head
CT was done which shows no acute process.

Electrocardiogram shows normal sinus rhythm at 61 beats per
minute with isolated ST elevation in V2 which is seen on
previous electrocardiogram.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  Change in mental status - The patient's change in mental
status was likely multifactorial.  The leading cause may be
Ultram which was recently started prior to this admission.
Other possible causes which were worked up were infection,
hypothyroidism.  A lumbar puncture was done which did not
show any evidence of central nervous system infection.  The
patient was scheduled for a magnetic resonance scan of the
head to further evaluate, however, he was not able to
tolerate the study.  Benzodiazepine and other sedative
medications were avoided initially.  TSH level was checked
and returned within normal limits.  Neurology consultation
was obtained for further evaluation.  They suggested that the
cause is most likely toxic or metabolic.  The patient's
mental status did show some improvement, however, he was
subsequently intubated due to respiratory failure.  Upon
extubation, the patient's mental status seemed good.  He was
oriented and able to respond appropriately to questions and
commands.  No other definitive cause to his mental status
changes was discovered to this point.

2.  Respiratory - Initially on admission, the patient had no
respiratory issues.  Initially was kept on his outpatient
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease medications including
his bronchodilators.  However, after several days in the
hospital, the patient had acute respiratory failure requiring
transfer to the Intensive Care Unit and intubation.  Blood
gases showed that the patient had hypercapnic respiratory
failure.  Cultures were taken including sputum culture.  The
patient was started on Vancomycin and Ceftazidime for
hospital acquired pneumonia.  Subsequently, sputum culture
grew out pseudomonas and the patient was maintained on
Cefepime and Ciprofloxacin for double coverage of
pseudomonas.  The Vancomycin was eventually discontinued as
there was no evidence of a gram positive infection.  The
patient showed gradual improvement on the mechanical
ventilation with antibiotics and nebulizers and chest
physical therapy.  His first extubation attempt, however,
failed.  After a short time of extubation, the patient again
had acute respiratory distress likely due to mucous plugging
and had to be reintubated.  The patient remained intubated
for approximately five days and then was again extubated.
This time the patient maintained good respiratory status off
mechanical ventilation.  He did require shovel mask for
hypoxia.

3.  Cardiovascular - The patient's hypertension medications
were initially held for low blood pressure.  The patient's
Amiodarone which he had been on for history of atrial
fibrillation was also held.  He maintained rate control
despite intermittent atrial fibrillation.  He was ruled out
for myocardial infarction.  Once his blood pressure
restabilized, the antihypertensive medications of ace
inhibitor and beta blocker were restarted.  The patient
remained in normal sinus rhythm for most of the rest of his
Intensive Care Unit stay.

4.  Hypothyroidism - The patient's Levoxyl dose was decreased
to 75 mcg once daily as his TSH was near normal limits and
his dose had recently been increased.  He was continued on
this dose and no further thyroid function tests were checked.

5.  Gastrointestinal - The patient presented with ileus.  He
required an aggressive bowel regimen for resolution of this.
Clostridium difficile toxin assay was also sent off which was
negative times one.  Subsequently in the hospitalization, the
patient had increasing white blood cell count without fevers.
There was concern again for Clostridium difficile infection
due to multiple antibiotics that he had been on.  Repeat
Clostridium difficile studies are still pending.

The rest of the [**Hospital 228**] hospital course and the rest of
this discharge summary will be dictated by another physician.
