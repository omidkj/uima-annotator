Service:  Medicine
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 78-year-old
male with a history of a abdominal aortic aneurysm rupture,
coronary artery bypass graft, diverticulosis, deep venous
thrombosis, and aspiration pneumonia who presents with
progressive weakness.
He has had progressive weakness of his lower extremities over
the past several months.  On the morning of admission, the
patient was getting out of bed.  At that time, he felt weak. He
denied lightheadedness, dizziness, shortness of breath, or chest
pain.   He went to urinate, but when he got up he fell to the
ground.  He denies any loss of consciousness.  Again, he denies
lightheadedness, chest pain, and palpitations.  He was unable to
get up, however, because he simply felt too weak.  He was not
sure how long he was on the ground, but ultimately was able to
get back to bed.  About three to four hours later he got out of
bed again.  At that time, he suddenly felt weak and collapsed
into a chair.  He called 911 and was brought to the Emergency
Room.

He still denies lightheadedness, no chest pain, no shortness
of breath, but he felt that his entire body was weak.  Of
note, he has a history of hemoptysis and guaiac-positive stool.
He had been seen by the Gastroenterology Service and had a
negative colonoscopy as well as a negative
esophagogastroduodenoscopy.

In the Emergency Room, his initial vital signs were a temperature
of 96.7, a heart rate of 103, and a blood pressure of 118/59. His
oxygen saturation was 98%.  He had a hematocrit of 21.2.  They
were unable to clear the blood by nasogastric lavage.  He was
seen by the Gastroenterology Service and taken to urgent
esophagogastroduodenoscopy.  His INR was found to be 5.2, so he
was given 4 units of fresh frozen plasma, 3 units of packed red
blood cells, and 5 mg of intravenous vitamin K, and 40 mg of
Protonix.  Of note, he had not checked his INR in several months
because "I don't like having the blood drawn."

He returned from esophagogastroduodenoscopy intubated due to
hematemesis and was admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit.

5.  Hypertension.
6.  Diverticulosis.
7.  Hypercholesterolemia.
8.  Question of benign prostatic hypertrophy.
9.  Inferior vena cava filter placement due to recurrent deep
venous thrombosis.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1.  Metoprolol 25 mg p.o. b.i.d.
2.  Coumadin 7.5 mg p.o. q.o.d.
3.  Lipitor 10 mg p.o. q.d.
4.  Iron supplements.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  On physical
examination on admission to the Medical Intensive Care Unit
his blood pressure was 143/59, his heart rate was 84, he was
afebrile, his oxygen saturation was 98%.  Generally, he
seemed to be in no acute distress.  His head, eyes, ears,
nose, and throat examination showed sclerae were anicteric
and constricted pupils.  He was intubated.  On neck
examination, no lymphadenopathy was appreciated.  His chest
was clear bilaterally with occasional rhonchi.  His
cardiovascular examination revealed a regular rate and
rhythm.  Normal first heart sound and second heart sound.  On
abdominal examination, he was obese and mildly distended with
active bowel sounds.  He was guaiac-positive in the Emergency
Department.  His extremities were nonedematous, and his
pulses were 2+ and symmetric.

PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:   His blood counts
were a white blood cell count of 10.3, hematocrit of 21.2,
and platelets were 215.  His PT was 27.4 with an INR of 5.2.
His sodium was 143, potassium was 3.9, chloride was 111,
bicarbonate was 19, blood urea nitrogen was 64, creatinine
was 0.7, and blood glucose was 156.

RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  Initial laboratory study revealed an
electrocardiogram with no acute ST-T wave changes.

A chest x-ray showed no consolidations or effusions.

HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM:  (While in the Medical Intensive
Care Unit)

1.  GASTROENTEROLOGY:  The patient has had repeated episodes
of hematemesis and was taken to urgent
esophagogastroduodenoscopy.  He was intubated for airway
protection prior to this procedure.

On esophagogastroduodenoscopy, he was found to have two ulcers in
his esophagus 40 cm from the incisors which were injected with
epinephrine for hemostasis.  A large amount of red blood was
found and suctioned from the stomach.  His duodenum was normal. A
rectal tube was placed, and he was started on pantoprazole 40 mg
b.i.d.

Three days later,  after his hematocrit had stabilized and the
bleeding was considered to have stopped, a repeat
esophagogastroduodenoscopy was performed which noted diffuse
erythematous mucosa in the lower third of the esophagus with
changes consistent with [**Doctor Last Name 15532**] esophagus.  A few nonbleeding 7-
mm ulcers with clean bases were found in the lower third of the
esophagus.  A single 6-mm nonbleeding polyp was found in the
stomach body; a cold forceps biopsy was performed for histology.
The duodenum was normal.  He also had an esophageal biopsy.

The pathology on the esophageal biopsy was returned as cardia-
type mucosa with focal goblet cells, metaplasia, and chronic
inflammation, but no squamous epithelium or dysplasia.  The
pathology on the gastric polyp showed foveolar hyperplasia
consistent with hyperplastic polyp.

2.  HEMATOLOGY:  The patient's initial hematocrit was 21.2.
He required multiple transfusions.  By [**7-2**] he had
received 4 units of packed red blood cells, 5 units of fresh
frozen plasma, and 2 units of platelet concentrate.  He
required several more units of packed red blood cells over
the next day, to a total of fifteen units, but has not had a
transfusion for the past six days.

3.  PULMONARY:  He was intubated on [**7-1**] at
esophagogastroduodenoscopy.  On [**7-3**], he had a temperature
spike to 102.2.  He was started on ceftriaxone and clindamycin
for presumed aspiration pneumonia.  After several attempts to
wean him off his intubation, he was successfully extubated on
[**7-5**].

4.  CARDIOVASCULAR:  He had two episodes of atrial fibrillation
on [**7-4**] but converted spontaneously.  No further therapy was
initiated.

He was transferred from the Medical Intensive Care Unit to
the Medicine floor on [**2149-7-6**].  On the Medicine Service
his hematocrit remained stable in the 35 range, and he required
no further transfusions.  His metoprolol was increased to 37.5 mg
b.i.d. for improved blood pressure control.  He was continued on
his course of ceftriaxone and clindamycin for a total of 10 days
but has remained afebrile on the Medicine Floor.  He was not
restarted on any anticoagulation given the history of the bleed
and medical noncompliance with heparin, in light of the fact
there was an inferior vena cava filter in place.

DISCHARGE DISPOSITION:  He will be discharged in stable
condition on [**7-9**] to [**Hospital6 85**].

DISCHARGE FOLLOWUP:   He will be followed by the Gastroenterology
Service by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) **].  He will also follow-up with his
primary care physician, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 22104**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) **].

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  Condition on discharge was stable.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
1.  Metoprolol 37.5 mg p.o. b.i.d.
2.  Pantoprazole 40 mg p.o. b.i.d.
3.  Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d. as needed.
4.  Atorvastatin 20 mg p.o. q.d.
5.  Clindamycin 600 mg intravenously q.8h. (last day on
[**2149-7-11**]).
6.  Ceftriaxone 1 g intravenously q.24h. (last day on
[**2149-7-11**]).

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Upper gastrointestinal bleed; likely from esophageal ulcers.
2.  Hypertension.
