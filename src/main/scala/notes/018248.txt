Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2297**]
Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea, pneumonia, Acute on Chronic CHF exacerbation

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Diagnostic and Therapeutic thoracentesis of right hemithorax


History of Present Illness:
Patient is an 84yo male with PMH of systolic CHF (EF 40%, with
recent TTE 30%), esophageal CA s/p gastroesophagectomy, CAD s/p
CABGx4, admitted for hypoxia, increasing SOB, now with transfer
to the MICU for hypoxia and hypotension. He was recently
admitted for an aspiration PNA and discharged on Augmentin. He
was then readmitted, and started on Vanc/ZOsyn and flagyl
briefly for HCAP. He continues to have a leukocytosis despite
abx. He had tapped pleural effusion that is transudative,
thought to be [**2-10**] CHF. He had a repeat TTE which showed
worsening EF from 40% to 30%. He was being diuresed with IV
lasix 40mg [**Hospital1 **], with inital improvement in hypoxia. However,
this was limited by now worsening renal failure. He is making
only ~300cc of urine in the last hour. His hospitalization has
also been complicated by hypernatremia, likely [**2-10**] decreased
free water access, not given back free water yet. This evening,
he became hypotensive to 82/56, mentating well A&Ox3, hypoxic 6L
NC with 55% facemask at 97%?. He had been hypoxic the evening
prior, with desats to 81% on 4LNC, iwht improvement with duonebs
& facemask. Since 0300 on the morning prior to transfer, pt was
on on 4LNC + 50%FM. For the hypotension, he was bolused 250ccx2
and then 500cc later this evening, with minimal BP response. A
code discussion was had between the patient and his daughter,
and the decision was made to reverse his code status to full
code.
.
Currently, he feels SOB, but that it has not changed in the last
couple of hours. He says that he started to feel worse this
afternoon after the thoracentesis was done. He denies any chest
pain or pain anywhere else. He has had a dry, non-productive
cough.
.
ROS: As above. last BM was today, brown per pt report. He also
always feels cold, which is unchanged.
Denies fever, chest pain, productive cough, abdominal pain,
diarrhea, bloody or black bowel movements.

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient is an 84yo male with PMH of Esophageal CA s/p
gastroesophagectomy with stomach pull-through, CAD s/p CABGx4,
and CHF with previous ejection fraction of 40% who presented
from rehab with acute shortness of breath from acute on chronic
CHF exacerbation, and aspiration pneumonia. Patient was recently
hospitalized for aspiration pneumonia, and chronically aspirates
even when following recommendations from speech and swallow
recommendations.  Pt was transferred to the MICU for hypoxia and
hypotension. Hypoxia was attributed to multifactorial etiology
of pulmonary edema from heart failure, pleural effusions and
pneumonia. He was persistently hypotensive, in part likely [**2-10**]
hypovolemia, but mostly thought to be secondary to systolic
heart failure. A code discussion was had with the family and pt
was made DNR/DNI with the decision not to pursue invasive
treatments with lines, pressors, etc. During the admission he
was made CMO and expired.
.
#. Shortness of breath/cough: Given patient's history of
aspiration event in the past with worrisome s+s eval and history
of acutely worsening dyspnea, patient likely had another
aspiration event. Concern for aspiration pneumonia vs.
aspiration pneumonitis. HCAP and atypical pneumonia remain
possibilities as well and were treated.  He was also in heart
failure.  Discussion was held with the patient and family, and
given the irreversibility of his heart failure and acute
worsening of his condition, he was made CMO and expired 7 days
after admission.
.
#. ARF: Patient with BUN/Cr suggestive of prerenal azotemia.
Possibly due to poor forward-flow in setting of CHF
exacerbation. However, worsening with diuresis. Creatinine
continued to worsen until his death.
