CT HEAD including perfusion [**5-17**]:
1. Acute left MCA distribution infarct with thrombus noted to
extend from the mid left M1 segment into the MCA bifurcation and
corresponding CT perfusion abnormalities. Some of these regions
do appear to displays slight mismatch suggesting that they may
be ischemic but not yet infarcted. No intracranial hemorrhage
status post TPA administration.

2. Dilated fluid-filled esophagus suggesting underlying
dysmotility or a
distal lesion. If alteration in care will occur and it is
clinically
feasible, dedicated esophogram could be performed on a
non-emergent basis.

3. Likely reactive mediastinal lymphadenopathy. Incidentally
detected left-sided SVC.

CT HEAD [**5-18**]:
Continued evolution of known large left MCA distribution
infarction with
increased edema noted on today's examination. No intracranial
hemorrhage is identified.

Echo: Severe tricuspid regurgitation. Dilated coronary sinus
with probable catheter in the coronary sinus. Mild symmetric
left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global systolic
function. Dilated right ventricle with preserved function. Mild
aortic stenosis.


Brief Hospital Course:
Patient is a [**Age over 90 **] y/o woman with advanced dementia and CAD s/p
pacer here with acute aphasia and right hemiparesis s/p IV tPA.
History of non-anticoagulated AF and
proximal occlusion suspicious for cardioembolic source of
infarction.  Given that patient received IV thrombolysis, not
deemed candidate for further endovascular therapy owing to time
from deficit, partial recanalization after tPA, risk of
hemorrhagic transformation.

She was initially admitted to the ICU and unfortunately, the IV
tPA did not work and she had dense L MCA infarct leaving her
globally aphasic with dense R sided weakness.  She had repeated
swallow evaluations including video swallow which showed pureed
diet with nectar thickened liquid is acceptable with some
aspiration risk.
She needs direct supervision with suction as needed per nursing
for feedings.

Although she has Afib, given the advanced dementia with fall
risk and large infarct, no Coumadin was started during this
admission.  Coumadin should be re-discussed upon follow-up as
outpatient with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) **].

Patient is on aspirin daily.  She was also found to be MRSA
positive on nasal swab testing during this admission.

Patient is returning to the nursing home where she resided
before with recommendations to continue with occupational,
physical and speech therapy.  She is to follow-up with Dr.
[**First Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) **] as outpatient.
