History of Present Illness:
HPI: Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a [**Age over 90 **] y/o woman with PMH significant for
asthma and recent C diff colitis who presented to the emergency
room earlier today with fever and hypotension. The patient was
discharged on [**2155-6-23**] after being diagnosed with C diff colitis;
she was discharged to finish a 3-week course of PO vancomycin
and flagyl. She completed antibiotics 10 days ago and reports
that at that time, her diarrhea had resolved. Starting about
four days ago, the patient began having loose stools (soft, not
liquid) about 2-3 times per day. This morning, she was febrile
to 104 (per report) and was sent to the emergency room. In the
ER, the patient's temp was 101.3 with initial blood pressure
50/30. With 1800 cc IV fluids, her blood pressure increased to
118/35. However, her subsequent blood pressures were quite
erratic, ranging from 70-132 systolic. She was started on a
dopamine gtt via peripheral IV with some improvement in blood
pressures. She was dosed with IV flagyl X 1 in the ED and
received a total of 4 L NS. For her fever, she received 30 mg IV
toradol X 1. She transiently complained of dyspnea and was given
an albuterol/atrovent neb with improvement.
.
On admission to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], the patient says that she feels
relatively well. She denies abdominal pain, nausea, and
vomiting. She reports several episodes of soft stools per day
for the past few days. She denies any respiratory difficulty,
cough, chest pain, blood in her stools, dysuria, or lower
extremity edema. She endorses a decreased appetite for several
weeks and decreased PO intake. Within the last few days, the
patient noticed that her lips were quite swollen; she saw her
PCP who treated her with hydroxyzine for presumed allergic
reaction. Her lips are now much improved per her report.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P:  Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a [**Age over 90 **] year old female who presents with
hypotension of unclear etiology, likely septic shock.
.
#  Hypotension.  On admission patient was hypotensive to the 70s
systolic.  This was thought to be most likely secondary to
septic shock vs. hypovolemia.  Her EKG was unchanaged and she
did not complain of chest pain making cardiogenic shock
unlikely. She received aggressive IVF hydration and peripheral
dopamine for pressure support.  She required vasopressor
medications for approximately 24 hours.  For the remainder of
her MICU course she was hemodynamically stable.
.
#  Sepsis.  On presentation the patient had a WBC count of 10.3
with 28% bands and a fever to 101.3 suggesting septic shock as
the etiology for her hyptension.  Her only localizing complaint
was diarrhea.  She completed a course of antibiotics for c. diff
colitis approximately ten days prior to presentation.  On exam
she had no abdominal pain and actually did not have any diarrhea
for hospital days one and two.   Her CXR showed a possible
pneumonia vs. atelectasis but on presentation she complained of
no respiratory symptoms.  She was started on broad spectrum
antibiotics.  Blood, urine and stool cultures were sent.  Blood
and urine cultures were negative but stool was positive for c.
diff.  Her antibiotics were changed to PO vancomycin and flagyl
with plans to complete a three week course. On discharge, she
had two soft bowel movements daily with resolution of her
diarrhea.
.
# Congestive Heart Failure:  Patient noted to be increasingly
short of breath on hospital day 2 with increased pulmonary edema
on CXR.  She was started on cautious diuresis as her blood
pressure would tolerate with good effect. Upon discharge, she
was off diuretics and without dyspnea.
.
# Mouth sores: On presentation she was noted to have numerous
small sores on her upper and lower lips thought to be herpes
labialis.  The lesions had been present for a number of days so
it was felt that oral acyclovir would not shorten her course.
She was given topical acyclovir and symptomatic therapy.
.
# Atrial Fibrillation: Patient noted to have intermittent atrial
fibrillation throughout her stay.  She was started on diltiazem
for rate control and her dose was titrated up to 180mg daily.
She was continued on her home dose of amiodarone.  Aspirin was
continued for oral anticoagulation.
.
#  Hypertension:  Following her initial presentation with
hypertension the patient was noted to be hypertenstive.  At home
the patient takes norvasc 2.5 mg and avapro 150 mg for HTN at
home.  She was started on norvasc and valsartan 80 mg.  On this
regimen she was persistently hypertensive and her atrial
fibrillation was poorly rate controlled.  This was switched to
valsartan 80 mg daily and diltiazem 30 mg daily with good blood
pressure and rate control. She subsequently developed
orthostatic hypotension and she was switched to extended release
diltiazem 180mg daily on discharge.
.
# Asthma: Patient received albuterol and ipratroprium inhalers
and was continued on her home dose of azmacort during this
hospitalization with good control of her asthma.
.
# Yeast Infection:  Patient noted to have vaginal yeast
infection on presentation.  Started on miconazole cream for
treatment and prophylaxis.
.
# Hypothyroidism: She was continued on her home dose of
levothyroxine.
.
# Prophylaxis.  She received subcutaneous heparin for DVT
prophylaxis.
