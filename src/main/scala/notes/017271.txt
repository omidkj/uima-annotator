Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7591**]
Chief Complaint:
High WBC count (relapsed AML)

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Placement and subsequent removal of pheresis line


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 20904**] is a 78 yo Cantonese speaking man with AML s/p 7+3
induction chemotherapy in [**2194-2-16**], who presents from clinic
with relapsed AML. He had been in peripheral remission for about
3 months. Patient interview was conducted with the help of
interpreter via telephone.
.
He was diagnosed with AML in [**2194-2-16**] when he presented to the
hospital with dizziness. He was found to be neutropenic and
anemic, and BM biopsy was consistent with AML. His 6[**Hospital **]
hospital stay included a brief ICU stay for respiratory distress
while receiving idarubicin for 7+3 induction, and then his
post-chemo course was complicated by C. [**Hospital 563**] candidemia.
Echo and eye exam were normal. He was initially started on
Micafungin for the candidemia, however LFTs were noted to rise
with a new abdominal pain. MRI was performed which ruled out
hepatosplenic involvement. Although it was felt unlikely that
micafungin caused the LFT elevation, it was switched to
anidlofungin per ID recs and was discharged home with 2 more
weeks of anidlofungin.
.
Since discharge from the hospital in [**2194-3-16**], pt reports
feeling "okay." His lower back has been bothering him since he
"fell back in the winter time," and he feels weak in the legs on
prolonged ambulation. He also endorses swelling in the lower
legs, but it's not new. Otherwise, his ROS is negative;
specifically, he denies fevers, chills, URI symptoms, nausea,
vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, dysuria.


Past Medical History:
1. AML as above
2. Diabetes Mellitus; followed by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 3636**] at [**Hospital **] Clinic; was
started on insulin during last admission in Efb [**2194**] however it
was stopped on [**2194-5-13**] per patient request (did not like the
[**Last Name (un) **] of checking FS and giving injections)
3. HTN

[**6-11**] ECHO:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. The estimated right atrial pressure
is 10-20mmHg. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The
left ventricular cavity size is normal. There is mild global
left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 50 %). There is no
ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size is
normal with mild global free wall hypokinesis. The ascending
aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are
mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Mild (1+)
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Mild to moderate ([**1-17**]+) mitral regurgitation
is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no pericardial effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2194-4-4**],
biventricular systolic function is now borderline/mildly
depressed. The degree of MR has slightly increased. Pulmonary
hypertension is now detected.


Brief Hospital Course:
Pt was admitted in good condition despite WBC count of 100,000
until ~ 6 pm on [**6-7**] when he started to become dyspneic, hypoxic
to 88% on RA with drop in UOP. There was a concern for
leukostasis and pt was transferred to MICU for urgent pheresis.

MICU course:  On [**6-6**] he spiked a temperature to 102.8F
overnight, with SVT to the 140's responsive to diltiazem, and
cefepime was started given functional neutropenia. He was doing
well on [**6-7**] with heart rates ~100, sats 92-95% on room air, and
respiratory rates in the 20's, until 6pm, when he was noted to
be more tachypneic (to the 30's), tachycardic (to the 150's),
and hypoxic (88% on room air). His urine output dropped off, and
a chest xray showed mild hilar prominence. LDH had doubled, and
white count had not dropped substantially. Given concern for
leukostasis, preparations for initiation of pheresis were made.
Given his likely tumor lysis, early DIC, likely leukostasis, and
tenuous respiratory and hemodynamic status, he was transferred
to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].

In the ICU, constellation of symptoms, including low urine
output and worsening respiratory status concerning for
leukostasis. Pheresis line was placed and leukoreduction therapy
undertaken.  Hypoxia was thought to be secondary to leukostasis,
and he maintained his O2 Sat on 2L NC.  Hydroxeaurea and
hydration were contineud to protect against tumor lysis. He was
afebrile but was given levaquin + vancomycin + zosyn for recent
fevers and functional neutropenia.

Pt underwent pheresis without incident and was transferred to
the floor. He was continued on Decitabine chemo per protocol
(total 5 days) and high dose hydroxyurea. He was on allopurinol
to reduce risk of hyperuricemia. Tumor lysis and DIC labs were
checked frequently. The patient appeared to be in early DIC
during the acute stage of needing leukopheresis however it did
not progress further. Pt had occasional fevers with no evidence
of infection. He was continued on Vanc, Cefepime, Acyclovr and
Fluconazole as he was neutropenic, but his fevers were thought
to be most likely due to disease process.

Summary of other issues:
# SVT/ Flash Pulm Edema: Pt went into SVT especially when
febrile. It responded well on Dilt IV (5 mg very slowly as BP
would transiently drop). Pt was maintained on Dilt 30 mg PO QID
with holding parameters. Lasix IV bolus was effective in
managing his respiratory distress. As his home hospice service
was unable to provide this, he was discharged on daily po lasix.
.
# Diabetes: He is followed by [**Last Name (un) **]. Pt was deemed to require
insulin however pt refused it at home due to the rigors of
checking blood sugars and giving appropriate doses of insulin.
Thus he was on glyburide instead at home.
- Held glyburide during hospital stay.
- FS QID and HISS
.
# Past hepatitis B exposure: HBV surface antigen negative, HBV
surface antibody positive, HBV core antibody (IGM) positive
- Pt was started on Lamivudine for concern of HBV reactivation
during prior admission. It was continued.

=======================================

GOALS OF CARE:
Several meetings were held with the team and the patient and his
family to discuss goals of care given his advanced age and grave
prognosis. The decision was made to make pt DNR/DNI, but to
complete a course of decitabine. On the BMT service, his WBC
initially seemed to respond to this therapy, but his peripheral
counts ulitmately demonstrated a recurrence of his disease. This
was discussed with him and his family; they chose to make him
CMO and be discharged home with hospice.
