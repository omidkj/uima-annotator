Conclusions:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric
left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Left  ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF
80%). No masses or thrombi  are seen in the left ventricle. The
right ventricular cavity is dilated. Right ventricular systolic
function is normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. The left
ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation. There
is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.
.
Compared with the findings of the prior report (images
unavailable for review)of [**2197-2-1**], the right ventricle
now appears somewhat dilated.

Brief Hospital Course:
70 F with COPD on home O2, morbid obesity with restrictive lung
physiology, OSA presented with pneumonia and respiratory failure
requring intubation for mechanical ventilation.
.
Respiratory failure: Secondary to pneumonia and COPD
exacerbation with poor underlying pulmonary reserve from morbid
obesity, untreated OSA, COPD, and diastolic heart failure.
Intubated for acute respiratory failure and treated with a
course of IV solumedrol for COPD exacerbation and broad
antibiotics (vanco and cipro) empirically for suspected
pneumonia, pending culture data. However sputum culture returned
negative for growth. Therefore antibiotics weaned to complete
course of ciprofloxacin. Component of respiratory failure also
felt secondary to diastolic heart failure and she was diuresed
without significant improvement in her ventilatory dependence.
.
She was difficult to wean from the ventilator, limited by
persistent rapid shallow breathing. In addition she was noted to
have high levels of anxiety and agitation when weaned off
sedation. Given ongoing high fevers on the vent, she was started
empirically for VAP with Ceftaz for an 8 day course. In
addition, she was noted to have methicillin resistant staph epi
in two separate blood culture sets. A-line was removed as a
potential source, and the tip was also noted to culture out
MRSE. Therefore she was treated with a 2 week course of
vancomycin.
.
After discussion with the health-care proxy, the plan was made
to optimize medical management and extubate on Monday [**3-10**]
without re-intubation under any circumstances. Goals of care
changed to DNR/DNI, with management directed towards comfort
measures.
