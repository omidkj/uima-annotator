HI[**Last Name (STitle) 2710**]OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 67-year-old
gentleman who has a several month history of shortness of
breath which has been improved over the last month.  The
patient was undergoing a preoperative evaluation for a right
total knee replacement and he was found to be in atrial
fibrillation in [**2182-5-12**] with severe CHF and moderate
mitral regurgitation by echocardiogram.  The patient was
admitted to the hospital for cardiac catheterization which
showed an ejection fraction of 55%, moderate to severe mitral
regurgitation, LVEDP of 24, a 50% LAD lesion and a 90%
circumflex lesion.  The patient was originally scheduled for
mitral valve replacement and CABG with Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] in
[**2182-7-12**]; however, the patient was found to have
moderate to large size rectal masses on physical examination.
These rectal masses were found to be benign polyps when they
were removed via colonoscopy.  The patient underwent several
subsequent colonoscopies each time with polypectomies and all
the polyps were found to be benign.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  CHF.
2.  Hypertension.
3.  Mitral regurgitation.
4.  Atrial fibrillation.
5.  Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
6.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
7.  TIA in [**2180**] without residual.
8.  Gout.
9.  Osteoarthritis.
10. Obesity.
11. Chronic renal insufficiency.
12. Anemia.

PREOPERATIVE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Colchicine 0.6 mg p.o. q.d.
2.  Lasix 40 mg p.o. b.i.d.
3.  Aspirin 81 mg p.o. q.d.
4.  Iron supplement.
5.  Digoxin 0.125 mg p.o. q.d.
6.  Toprol XL 100 mg p.o. q.d.
7.  Lisinopril 10 mg p.o. q.d.
8.  Protonix 40 mg p.o. q.d.

ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient has a remote history of tobacco,
quit 75 years ago.  Admits to occasional ETOH.  He is a
retired custodian.  He lives with his wife.

LABORATORY/RADIOLOGIC DATA:  The patient underwent carotid
ultrasound preoperatively which were without flow-limiting
stenosis.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the [**Hospital6 1760**] on [**2182-9-9**].  The
patient was taken to the Operating Room on [**2182-9-10**]
for a CABG times one; SVG to OM, and a mitral valve
replacement with a 29 mm [**Last Name (un) 3843**]-[**Doctor Last Name **] pericardial
valve.  The patient also underwent a ligation and stapling of
the left atrial appendage.  In the Operating Room, the
patient's mitral valve was found to have changes consistent
with active endocarditis which was an unexpected finding.
The valve was sent for culture.  On initial Gram's stain, the
valve showed 2+ gram-positive rods and 2+ gram-positive cocci
in pairs and clusters.  The subsequent valve culture grew
coagulase-negative Staphylococcus.  Please see the operative
note for further details.

The patient was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit on
milrinone and Neo-Synephrine infusion.  Postoperatively, the
patient arrived from the Operating Room in rapid atrial
fibrillation with rates in the 120s-150s.  The patient was
given volume and low-dose beta blocker.  The patient
subsequently converted into a sinus rhythm.  The patient's
milrinone was weaned down with an adequate cardiac index.
The patient was weaned and extubated from mechanical
ventilation on the first postoperative night.  The patient
had been started on his perioperative vancomycin and
levofloxacin was ordered empirically for coverage of the
valve.

The Infectious Disease Team was consulted and they
recommended discontinuing the levofloxacin and adding
gentamicin until the final cultures of the valve were
available.  The patient remained afebrile postoperatively and
the patient was transferred from the Intensive Care Unit to
the floor on postoperative day number two.  The patient began
ambulating with Physical Therapy and was initially able to
walk about 300 feet.  The patient had significant bilateral
knee varus with difficulty ambulating.

On postoperative day number three, the patient had a PICC
catheter placed at the bedside by IV Therapy for long-term
antibiotics.  On postoperative day number four, the patient's
pacing wires were removed.  The patient continued to remain
afebrile.  The patient's creatinine was monitored carefully
and it remained in the range of 1.5.

On the evening of postoperative day number four, the
Infectious Disease Team recommended starting Clindamycin to
increase the anaerobic coverage for the gram-positive rods.
On chest x-ray, it was noted that the patient had elevated
left hemidiaphragm with left lower lobe atelectasis.  This
finding persisted through all of the patient's postoperative
chest x-rays in spite of the patient maintaining good room
air oxygen saturation and aggressive pulmonary toilet.  The
patient continued to work with Physical Therapy.

On postoperative day number six, the patient began
complaining of some right-sided pleuritic chest pain.  The
chest x-ray at that time showed no infiltrate and no effusion
on the right side.  We were unable to medicate the patient
with any NSAIDs due to the patient's renal insufficiency.
The patient was due for discharge on postoperative day number
seven.  However, on the morning of postoperative day number
seven, the patient had some nonsustained ventricular
tachycardia.

The Electrophysiology Service was consulted.  An
echocardiogram was performed which showed an ejection
fraction of 40% without any significant changes in wall
motion abnormality.  It was recommended that the patient be
continued on an increased dose of his beta blocker and no
other antiarrhythmic therapy or implantable cardiac
defibrillator would be recommended.  However, it was
recommended that the patient be started on Coumadin for his
history of atrial fibrillation and this was started on
postoperative day number seven.

Also, on postoperative day number seven, the Infectious
Disease Team recommended discontinuing the gentamicin and
recommended continuing the patient on long-term vancomycin
treatment.  It was decided by the Cardiac Surgery Team to
continue the Clindamycin for continued anaerobic coverage as
well.

On postoperative day number eight, the patient continued to
have right-sided pleuritic chest pain which improved with
pain medication, reproducible with inspiration.  The chest
x-ray again showed no infiltrate or effusion.  The patient
was cleared for discharge to a rehabilitation facility.
