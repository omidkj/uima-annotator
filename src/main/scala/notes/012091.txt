Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 93884**] is a 47 year old with known fibroid uterus who
presents to the ED with acute abdominal pain, nausea, and
vomiting.  At that time, she was afebrile with a normal white
blood cell count and a pelvic US showed: an enlarged uterus with
multiple uterine fibroids. At least two large exophytic
pedunculated fibroid masses. The dominant fibroid seen in the
left lower quadrant of the abdomen with carneous degeneration
seen on the prior MRI of [**2169-3-31**], has minimally increased in
size. Additional smaller degenerating fibroids are similar. No
significant change in the overall fibroid size. Trace free fluid
in the left lower quadrant. Left ovarian endomteriomas are
stable since [**2169-4-7**].

Degenerating and possibly torsion of these known fibroids and/or
left ovarian cyst was thought to be the cause of her acute pain.
 She had been scheduled for UAE and hysterectomy to follow in
the upcoming months, but decision was made to proceed urgently
with these procedures.  She had a UAE then proceeded to the OR
for laparoscopy converted to supracervical hysterectomy and LSO
for fibroid uterus and endometrioma.  Intra-operative findings
revealed a markedly enlarged fibroid uterus (weighing ~2129g),
stage 4 endometriosis with extensive adhesions, a large left
ovarian endometrioma, and copious amount of brown tinged
ascites-- the cause of the patient's acute pain was unclear.
Please refer to Dr.[**Name (NI) 93885**] operative note for full details.  She
received 1u PRBC intraop for 1000cc EBL; hematocrit was stable
post-op at 34 -> 32.

Post-op, she was admitted to the ICU for close monitoring given
her long operation and large amount of intraoperative fluids.
She remained hemodynamically stable during her ICU stay.  Her
pain was managed with a Dilaudid PCA with good effect.  She was
transferred back to the ob/gyn service on POD1.

Post-operatively, she did very well.  Her post-operative
milestones were met by POD [**2-6**].  Her diet was advanced slowly
given extensive lysis of adhesions. A plan was made to keep the
foley in place for 10-14 days post-operatively to allow for
bladder healing given the extent of lysis of adhesions involving
the bladder.  She was discharged to home on POD 5 in good
condition.
