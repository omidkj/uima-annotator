Pertinent Results:
[**2146-4-18**] Carotid Ultrasound
1. Less than 40% stenosis of the bilateral internal carotid
arteries.
2. Absence of diastolic flow in the left vertebral artery,
suggestive of
distal stenosis or occlusion.

[**2146-4-19**] Cardiac Catheterization
1.  Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system

demonstrated moderate two vessel branch coronary artery disease
with
diffuse atherosclerosis.  The LMCA was heavily calcified with a
distal
35% stenosis.  The LAD was heavily calcified with a mild 20%
stenosis at
the origin.  There was mild diffuse plaquing throughout the
proximal and
mid LAD to 30%.  A large D1 had a 50% stenosis at the origin
with a
small adjacent diagonal branch.  The next D2 is of modest
caliber.  The
distal LAD was turtuous.  In the mid-distal segment was likely
intramyocardial.  The LCX was heavily calcified and supplied a
modest
high OM1 and a small long OM2, and a large OM3/LPL with low
density of
vessels in the lateral wall.  There was mild diffuse plaquing in
AV
groove CX.  The OM2 had a proximal 50% stenosis.  The RCA had an

anterior takeoff and had to canulated using an [**Doctor Last Name **]-1.  The RCA
was
heavily calcified and had diffuse disease to 40% mid vessel.
2.  Resting hemodynamics revealed elevated right and left
ventricular
enddiastolic pressures measured at 12 and 28 mmHg, respectively.
 The
mean PCWP was 13 mmHg.  The mean PA pressure was 23 mmHg (phasic
31/14
mmHg).  The cardiac index was 2.5 L/min/m2 (using an assumed
oxygen
consumption).  There was mild aortic stenosis with a mean
gradient of 15
mmHg and a calculated aortic valve area of 1.3 cm2 (based on an
assumed
VO2 and an UNDERESTIMATE in the setting of known aortic
regurgitation).
The [**Location (un) 109**] could not be quantitate precisely due to the presence of
aortic
regurgitation and an artificial gradient created by the
[**Name9 (PRE) 81698**]
methodology of measuring simultaneous LV-AO pressures.
3.  Left ventriculography was not performed.  The aortic valve
was
calcified.

[**2146-4-20**] ECHO
The left atrium is elongated. The right atrium is moderately
dilated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy
with normal cavity size and global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion
abnormality cannot be fully excluded. There is no ventricular
septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened. There is mild aortic valve stenosis (valve area
1.2-1.9cm2). Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Mitral regurgitation is present but cannot be
quantified (likely trivial or mild). The tricuspid valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is mild pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is a trivial/physiologic
pericardial effusion.

[**2146-4-27**] CXR
FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, the size of
the cardiac
silhouette is unchanged. Unchanged extent of the right-sided
pleural
effusion, on the left, the effusion is barely visible. No newly
occurred
parenchymal opacities suggestive of pneumonia.


[**2146-4-29**] 06:15AM   INR      1.9*


Brief Hospital Course:
Admitted for preoperative workup which included dental
extraction and cardiac catherization. On [**4-20**] he was brought to
the operating room for aortic valve replacement and repair of
ascending aortic aneurysm.  See operative report for further
details.  He received vancomycin for perioperative antibiotics
due to being in the hospital greater than twenty four hours
prior to surgery.  Postoperatively he was transferred to the
intensive care unit for hemodynamic management.  He was
hemodynamically unstable requiring multiple vasoactive
medications and remained intubated.  He progressively improved
and post operative day one medications were slowly weaned, post
operative day two all vasoactive medications were weaned off.
He was weaned from sedation, awoke and was extubated.  Lasix was
started for diuresis.  On post operative day two he also had
rapid atrial fibrillation treated with amiodarone and
betablockers, he converted back to normal sinus rhythm.  Due to
persistent thrombocytopenia, a HIT was checked which was
negative.  Physical therapy worked with him on strength and
mobility.  He remained in the intensive care unit for pulmonary
management and was ready for transfer to the floor on post
operative day five. He had additional episodes of atrial
fibrillation, and coumadin was initiated.  Progressively he
improved and was ready for discharge to rehab on post operative
day nine.
