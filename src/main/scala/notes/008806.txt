Radiology
CXR - AP view of the chest obtained. Heart is enlarged. Lungs
appear clear, though underpenetrated technique does limit
evaluation somewhat. No large effusion or pneumothorax is seen.
Mediastinal contour is normal. Bones appear intact.

Brief Hospital Course:
# COPD Exacerbation - In the MICU, the patient was given
prednisone, ceftriaxone/azithromycin, lasix 20 mg IV and nebs.
Her dyspnea greatly improved with this therapy.  Given that
there was no infiltrate on CXR and her lack of fever, the
ceftriazone was discontinued.  A flu swab was sent and was
negative.  On transfer to the floor, the patient stated that her
dyspnea had improved.  The patient was noted to desat to the
mid-80's with ambultation (on room air).  Therefore, at
discharge, she was given a prescription for home oxygen.  She
was also discharged to complete a prednisone burst and a 5-day
course of azithromycin.

# CHF - The patient's BNP was elevated on admission.  However,
she had not gained any weight recently and there was no
pulmonary edema on CXR.  She was given 20 mg IV lasix in the
MICU and diuresed well.  She was then maintained on her home PO
lasix regimen.

# GERD - The patient was continued on her omeprazole.

# Hyperlipidemia - The patient was continued on her
atorvastatin.

# RA - The patient was continued on her hydroxychloroquine while
in-house.  She was also continued on her leflunomide and
methotrexate at discharge.

#HTN - The patient was continued on her home lisinopril,
amlodipine, and metoprolol.
