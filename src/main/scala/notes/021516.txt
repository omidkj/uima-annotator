History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 76 yo woman with rheumatoid arthritis on
prednisone and methotrexate who presents with several days of
fatigue/lethargy and was found in the ED to be in septic shock.
She has been in [**Country 4754**] for the past several months and during
this visit she had a hospitalization about 3-4 weeks ago for a
diverticular bleed.  She recovered from her illness but in the
past several days prior to her arrival she had been more
fatigued that usual, taking many day-time naps.  ROS positive
for occasional cough productive of brownish sputum, but no chest
pain, shortness of breath, abdominal pain, N/V, fevers, joint
effusions, or any other problems.  [**Name (NI) **] daughter went to [**Name (NI) 4754**]
to accompany her home as scheduled and on the plane 1-day prior
to arrival she was noted to be progressively lethargic.  She
went to her PCP directly from the airport who evidently drew
labs which were suggestive of infection and he started her on
augmentin for a presumed respiratory infection.  Ms. [**Known lastname **]
returned home and her daughter noted that her mental status
progressively worsened until 1am when she was barely responsive
and non-communicative.
.
At that point she was taken by EMS to [**Hospital1 18**] ED.  Her presenting
vitas were T 100.7, HR 110, BP 80/palp with RR 20 and 89% on RA.
 Her BP improved with 3L NS, but she then spiked a fever to
103.0 and her blood pressure dipped into the mid 80's with
hypoxia on a few L nasal canula.  CXR was interpreted by the ED
staff as RLL and possibly LLL pneumonia so she was given a dose
of vancomycin, levofloxacin, and metronidazole.  A precept RIJ
catheter was placed and she was started on levophed with
improvement in mentation and blood pressure.
.
On questioning at arrival to the ICU she stated that she felt
well, did endorse occasional brown sputum, denied SOB, abdominal
pain.  She did endorse arthritis pain but could not articulate
the location of the pain.  Her mental status has waxed and waned
since being here.
.


Past Medical History:
1.  Rheumatoid arthritis diagnosed in [**2136**], on MTX and
prednisone since that time.  complicated by the need for B total
knee replacements and single hip replacement.  Also with B hand
atrophy and Rt shoulder deformity.
2. Steroid-induced diabetes (started on metformin 3 months ago)
3. Diverticular bleed


Social History:
Emmigrated from [**Country 4754**] at the age of 70 to live with her
daughter.  Widowed with 9 children, 2 in [**Location (un) 86**].  Has smoked 1
PPD since the age of 20.  No EtOH.

.
EKG: sinus tachycardia.  No ischaemic signs.
.
CT chest [**10-3**]:
1) Extensive centrilobular nodules, tree-in-[**Male First Name (un) 239**] nodules
suggesting tree-in-[**Male First Name (un) 239**] and discrete nodules as described.
Differential diagnosis would include infectious process such as
viral infection or mycoplasma. Tuberculosis is less likely. The
interstitial lung disease due to methotrexate Treatment is
unlikely. No evidence of lung fibrosis to suggest chronic
interstitial lung disease.
2) Areas of ground-glass most likely representing a similar
process.
3) Status post cholecystectomy with aerobilia most likely
post-surgical.
4) Bronchomalacia especially in the right middle and right lower
lobe. Bronchial wall thickening and peribronchial inflammation
most likely representing the same process as described.
.
CT head w/o contrast [**10-3**]:
1. No evidence of intracranial hemorrhage.
2. Focal hypoattenuation within the left frontal lobe that could
represent a chronic ischemic event given the fact that there is
no sulci effacement and mild dilatation of the ipsilateral
frontal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the lateral ventricle suggestive of volume loss.
However, in view of patient's symptoms, gadolinium-enhanced MRI
with diffusion imaging is recommended for further
characterization.
3. Confluent hypodensities in the periventricular and deep white
matter, nonspecific, likely represents chronic ischemic changes.


Brief Hospital Course:
1. Community acquired pneumonia with septic shock: Initially
admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] with pressor support.  No source identified
with negative Pneumocystis jirovecii, Legionella, and blood
cultures negative.  CT chest showed atypical linear infiltates
consistent with a viral or atypical process.  Improved gradually
on IV vancomycin and cefipime.  Respiratory status remained
tenuous with CO2 retention even after transfer to the floor.
She was converted to oral abx. with cefpodoxime and azitromycin.
 She required oxygen throughout the hospitalization.  Pulmonary
consultation was obtained as pt. was noted to have digital
clubbing, a lengthy smoking history, and with rheumatoid
arthritis, the question of chronic underlying lung disease was
entertained.  Pulmonary felt o2 requirement explained by
pneumonia - no evidence of underlying lung disease on CT.
Recommended continued oxygen at home (arranged) and outpatient
follow up within three weeks.
.
2. Altered mental status: possibly delirium from sepsis.
Improved to baseline prior to tranfer to floor.
.
3. Adrenal insufficiency: long term steroid use for rheumatoid
arthritis.  Hypotension on admission could have been sepsis or
adrenal insufficiency in the setting of stress from viral
illness.  She was initiated on stress dose steroids, and these
were weaned prior to discharge towards a baseline maintenance
level of 10 mg daily.  She was put on PCP prophylaxis with
bactrim.

4. Rhuematoid arthritis: Methotrexate was held in the setting of
acute infection and stress dose steroids as above.  She was
dishcharged on 10 mg daily prednisone with instructions to
follow up with her PCP and [**Name9 (PRE) 68053**] as an outpatient
regarding adjustment of her prednisone and re: possible
re-institution of methotrexate.

5. Hyperglycemia/steroid induced diabetes (insulin resistance) -
pt. was taking metformin as outpatient, was covered by SSI while
getting steroids, as above.  Resumed metformin on discharge.

6. SVT - one episode of PAF in ICU, did not recur on telemetry.
