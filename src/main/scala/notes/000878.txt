History of Present Illness:
89 year old Female with history of severe COPD on 2L Home
Oxygen, pulmonary hypertension, renal insufficiency and carotid
insufficiency was referred to the ED for hyponatremia and
dyspnea. Mrs. [**Known lastname **] was brought to the ED by EMS with dyspnea
x 2 days, recieving multiple nebulizer treatments in route to
the ED. Dyspnea started 2 days prior to admission, accompanied
with bilateral leg swelling. Denies any chest pain. No
palpitations. Says her urine output seems unchanged.

Symptoms started "when the weather got hot." She reports having
a poor apetite over the last few days and drinks very little. Of
note, Mrs. [**Known lastname **] was recently started on Lasix ([**6-3**]) for
symptom control of her cor pulmonale. Her sodium was noted to
decline gradually on subsequent with nadir of 122 on the morning
of referral to the emergency room. She has continued to take her
daily lasix, despite her PCP notifying her of her low sodium and
encouraging her to stop taking that med. Additionally, Mrs.
[**Known lastname **] was recently started on home O2, 2L, and is supposed to
wear it at all times, previously just at night. Her
granddaughter notes she often takes her oxygen off, particularly
while at her day program.

In the ED, initial vs were: T=98.1, HR=81, BP=121/76, RR=16
98%4LNC. Patient was given lasix, nitro gtt and BiPap, ASA 325,
for a presumed CHF exacerbation. Her CXR came back clear. She
was additionally treated for a COPD exacerbation with albuterol
and ipatropium nebs, azithromycin and solumedrol.

                            **FINAL REPORT [**2161-6-19**]**

   MRSA SCREEN (Final [**2161-6-19**]):    No MRSA isolated.

Brief Hospital Course:
1. COPD with Acute Exacerbation:
- Pts dyspnea, hypoxemia, but normal CO2, was thought to be
secondary to Pulmonary HTN exacerbation in setting of low
intravascular volume. Patient had poor PO intake several days
prior to admission and continued her daily lasix which likely
volume depleted her. She had an echocardiogram which showed
severe pulmonary HTN but no sigificant changes from her [**2157**]
echo. She was given nasal canula O2 and weaned down to her home
dose of 2L. She was then given a steroid taper with prednisone
from [**6-17**] through [**6-21**] at the direction of the pulmonary
consultation team in concert with her primary pulmonologist Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 2168**].

2. Hyponatremia:
Found to have hypo-osmolar hyponatremia. Likely secondary to low
volume state after several days of poor PO intake and persistent
lasix with free water repletion. She was given lasix in ED as
patient was thought to initially present with CHF exacerbation.
Fluids were then repleted and Na levels normalized from
116-->138 over the admission. She was not restarted on
diuretics.

3. Pulmonary Hypertension:
- Unclear etiology as patient was known in OMR to have severe
pulmonary HTN but mild obstructive pattern on PFTs.  Echo
revealed peristent severe pulmonary HTN with no signs of left or
right heart failure. Patient should meet with pulmonologist
outpatient to follow up.

4. Acute Renal Failure on Stage III CKD:
- Patient was pre-renal with low volume status. Cr peaked at 1.8
and baseline is 1.6. Gave IVF and Cr trended down to 1.3.

5. Hyperkalemia:
- Pt had hyperkalemia on admission. Cortisol level was 39 making
adrenal insuficiency unlikely. Losartan likely contributed to
hyperkalemia and was discontinued.

6. Benign Hypertension:
Her hypertension mends were all held while in the ICU. And her
beta-blocker and calcium channel blocker were restarted prior to
discharge on the floor.

DISPO: She was sent for short term rehabilitation for mobility
and strengthing, along with stability training while carrrying
her oxygen.
