Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1055**]
Chief Complaint:
Esophageal Variceal Bleeding and Shock

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation and Transjugular Intrahepatic Portosystemic Shunt
Placement

History of Present Illness:
59F with a history of alcoholic cirrhosis complicated by portal
hypertension, splenomegaly, ascites, and grade III esophageal
varices, DM-II, reactive airways disease, and possibly
hemochromatosis who is being transferred from an OSH for
management of her bleeding esophageal varices and possible TIPS
placement. The pt was initially admitted to [**Hospital 1562**] Hospital on
[**2127-8-28**] for symptomatic hematemesis. She was transfused pRBC and
on the day of admission she underwent EGD-guided variceal
banding and sclerotherapy. She was intubated for airway
protection, monitored in the ICU, and treated with an octreotide
drip, empiric antibiotics (ciprofloxacin) for prophylaxis
against SBP, and vitamin k. She was extubated [**9-1**], and was
called out to the floor given her clinical and hemodynamic
stability. On [**9-4**], EGD was repeated, grade III esophageal
varices were again seen, and banding was again performed at that
time. Although she was not reintubated at that time, she was
again intubated on [**9-8**] for airway protection in the setting of
altered mental status that had been present for roughly five
days; she has been intubated since that time. Because of her
altered mental status, and given her moderate ascites, a
paracentesis was performed on [**9-9**] to r/o spontaneous bacterial
peritonitis. This study was not diagnostic of SBP (there were
roughly 60 PMNs per mL in the ascitic fluid), and the culture of
the ascitic fluid was negative, but the patient was empirically
treated for SBP nonetheless. She was also treated with lactulose
beginning on [**9-8**], as her serum ammonia level was drastically
elevated (622). There was also a question of a LLL pneumonia on
CXR (which likely would have been treated by the ceftriaxone
that was started for empiric treatment of her SBP) vs. ICU
psychosis. On [**2127-9-12**] she had a second episode of variceal
bleeding; EGD was again performed, and bleeding grade III
esophageal varices were again sclerosed. She was again treated
with an octreotide drip and was again transfused pRBC; she was
transfused a total of 21 units of pRBC throughout her
hospitalization at the OSH. On [**9-19**] she had a third episode of
UGIB and plans were then made for transfer to the [**Hospital1 18**] for
evaluation of possible TIPS placement.

The remainder of her hospital course was noteworthy for the
following:

(1) A seizure on [**9-16**]. She was subsequently loaded on phenytoin
and treated with fosphenytoin after a head CT was found to be
negative.

(2) Progressive abdominal distension beginning on roughly [**9-13**].
KUBs have demonstrated dilated loops of bowel consistent with
ileus vs. partial obstructon.

(3) Vaginal bleeding of unclear etiology; a pelvic U/S [**9-15**] was
unremarkable (except for the known abdominal ascites).

(4) Bronchoscopy [**9-12**] with brushings of an endobronchial lesion
in the anterior segment of the RLL consistent with non-small
cell lung cancer.

(5) Despite good UO, she had an increasing BUN and Cr throughout
her course.

Past Medical History:
1. Alcoholic cirrhosis complicated by portal hypertension,
ascites, splenomegaly, and grade III esophageal varices
2. Alcoholism (current EtOH Use) x 30yrs
3. Possible diagnosis of hemochromatosis treated with phlebotomy
4. Pneumonia [**2124**]
5. R Ankle Fx [**3-/2127**]
6. Reactive airways disease
7. Type II Diabetes Mellitus (diet-controlled)
8. Hyperparathyroidism (?) s/p parathyroidectomy
9. Lung lesion suspicious for Squamous Cell Carcinoma

Social History:
Pt lives in [**Location (un) 6251**], MA with husband, children,
son-in-law, and two grandchildren, She does not use tobacco or
drugs, but drinks [**2-21**] glasses of vodka per day for 30 years.

Family History:
Mother is alive at age [**Age over 90 **]; she has DM-II and CAD. Father died at
age 67 from complications of stomach cancer. The patient's three
brothers have [**Name (NI) 21418**] and CAD. Her three sisters, three sons, and
two daughters are all healthy.
