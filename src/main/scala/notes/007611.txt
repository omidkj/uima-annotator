Chief Complaint:
bradycardia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
AAI pacer
electrical cardioversion

History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **] yo woman with past history of Hypertension and urinary
incontinence presents with syncope and bradycardia.

Per report patient was recieving physical therapy when she
became diaphoretic and unresponsive.  Physical therapist took
patient's BP which was 70s/?? with a pulse in the 30s.  EMS was
called and patient's BP was 70-80s/40s with a pulse of 30-40
BPM.  Patient was given atropine with no change in pulse.

Upon arrival to the ED patient was AOx3 and mentating well, but
was persistantly hypotensive to the 70s systolic with pulses in
the 30s.  Patient was given calcium and glucagon without
response as well as 1 L of fluid with no change in her systolic
pressures.  Patient was then started on dopamine drip at 20
mg/min with no change in her systolics.   EKG showed a
junctional rhythm.

Upon arrival to the CCU patient was 78/39 HR 49, mentating
normally.  She denied any dizziness, SOB or chest pain.  Denied
any exposure to ticks or new rashes in the preceeding weeks.
.
On review of systems, she denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. S/he denies recent fevers, chills or
rigors. S/he denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the
other review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,
ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

EKG [**9-17**]:  Fairly regular rhythm with one or two early beats of
the same morphology. Left ventricular hypertrophy by voltage in
lead aVL. P waves are not well seen. ST-T wave abnormalities
including J point and ST segment elevationin leads V1-V2. Since
the previous tracing of [**2175-3-16**] the rate is slower. P waves are
now not apparent. Voltage and ST-T wave abnormalities are
probably more prominent including QTc interval prolongation.
Junctional rhythm versus atrial fibrillation and high grade A-V
block. Clinical correlation is suggested.

CXR [**9-21**]:  FINDINGS: Accounting for differences in positioning,
there is likely little significant interval change in moderate
to severe pulmonary edema. Bilateral pleural effusions and
bibasilar atelectasis are present and appear slightly improved
on the right. No pneumothorax is seen. The cardiomediastinal
silhouette is unchanged. Left-sided pacemaker with single lead
is unchanged in position.

Brief Hospital Course:
[**Age over 90 **] yo woman w/ a hx of HTN and no previous cardiac history who
presents with persistant hypotension and bradycardia.
.
# Bradycardia:  Patient presented with bradycardia and
hypotension which was not repsonsive to atropine or fluid
administration.  EKG showed a narrow complex w/ no P waves and
regular rhythm on tele.  Diagnosis of a high junctional escape
with intact AV node was made and the patient had an atrial pacer
placed.  Post procedure patient was stable with an improvement
in her BPs to the 130s systolic.
.
# Atrial fibrillation.  On HD 3 pt went into atrial fibrillation
with RVR.  She was hemodynamically stable with heart rates in
130s-140s.  She was given a total of 15mg IV diltiazem and
started on 90mg PO diltiazem q6hrs.  Patient remained stable,
but did not [**Last Name (un) **] to sinus rhythm with medical management.
Paitnet was then successfully electrically cardioverted out of
concern that her preload dependence from hypertensive diastolic
heart failure and lack of atrial kick placed her at risk for
flash pulmonary edema.  She was started on lovenox 60mg SC daily
(renally dosed) for prophylaxis and will need a total of one
month treatment as long as she remains in sinus rhythm.
.
# Hypotension:  Patient initially presented hypotensive to the
80s and received in excess of 3 L of fluid while in the ED with
no improvment in systolic pressure.  Patient was stablized on a
dopamine drip and went for atrial pacer placement.
Post-procedure patient was normotensive and no longer required
pressor support.
.
#  Hypertension:  Post-pacer placement patient became
hypertensive to the 160s in the setting of holding her home
antihypertensives.  She was then started on PO hydralazine,
imdor and metoprolol succinate for afterload reduction.  Patient
was discharged on hydralazine 50 mg PO Q8H, Issosorbide
Mononitrate 90 mg QAM, Metoprolol succinate 50 mg QD, valsartan
80 mg QHS.
.
# UTI:  Patient had a positive UA in the ED and urine cultures
which grew out a bactrim/cipro resistant E coli.  Patient was
treated with a 5 day course of ceftriaxone.

# Hypothyroidism:  TSH and T4 were sent to rule out involvement
in patient's bradycardia and patient was continued on home
levothyroxine regiment.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
-On presentation patient stated that she was DNR/DNI, at the
time of transfer patient was reconsidering her code status, but
wanted to speak with her daugher who could not be reached.  This
will need to be readdressed.  Her daughter and [**Name (NI) 18133**] name is
[**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) 18134**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 18135**] (h), [**Telephone/Fax (1) 18136**] (c).
-Patient will need a UA to confirm celerance of UTI (incontinent
while at [**Hospital1 18**], unable to provide repeat specimin).
