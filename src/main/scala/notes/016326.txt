Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1899**]
Chief Complaint:
Nausea and vomiting


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 656**] is a 88yo Russian-speaking man with history of
hypertension, afib, pacemaker, and diabetes presenting with
nausea, vomiting, and elevated blood pressure. Patient states he
felt fine when he went to bed the night PTA and then he woke up
at 4 AM [**10-17**] feeling nauseated and vomited several times. His
wife took his blood pressure and it was reported as 240/140 (in
the setting of vomiting). Patient did not eat all day but was
able to take his medications.  Patient states he has been
compliant with his blood pressure medication and has not had any
new adjustments in his medications. He denies headache, chest
pain, shortness of breath, cough, palpitations, or abdominal
pain. He has never had a blood pressure this high before.
.
In the ED, VS 97.6 62 197/75 16 96%.  EKG showed paced @64 with
a prolonged QTc.  CXR showed mild pulm [**Month/Year (2) 1106**] congestion, no
focal consolidation.  Cr 1.4 was at baseline.  Reglan given.
Admited for symptom control and rule out
.
Upon transfer to the floor, SBP > 200 and patient complained of
chest pressure/discomfort and so trigger was called.  EKG showed
no changes, and CE were negatve x2. Hydralazine 25mg pushed and
new BP was SBP 140s.  Patient was asymptomatic s/p hydralazine.
Family by bedside.  Interpreter present.

IMAGING:

#[**2182-10-18**] CXR:
FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**10-17**], the patient has
taken a
substantially better inspiration. There is continued enlargement
of the
cardiac silhouette with diffuse pulmonary [**Date Range 1106**] congestion.
Dual-channel pacemaker device remains in place. No evidence of
acute focal pneumonia
.
#[**2182-10-17**] SUPINE AND LEFT LATERAL DECUBITUS VIEWS OF THE
ABDOMEN: A non-obstructive bowel gas pattern is demonstrated. No
free intraperitoneal air or dilated loops of small bowel are
seen. There is no pneumatosis. Small-to-moderate amount of fecal
material is seen throughout the colon. There are diffuse
[**Month/Day/Year 1106**] calcifications with phleboliths noted in the pelvis.
Multilevel degenerative changes are visualized within the imaged
thoracolumbar spine. Several clips are noted within the
epigastric region.
IMPRESSION: Non-obstructive bowel gas pattern without evidence
for free
intraperitoneal air.
.
#[**2182-10-17**] UPRIGHT AP VIEW OF THE CHEST: Patient is status post
median sternotomy and CABG. A left-sided pacemaker device is
noted with leads terminating in the right atrium and right
ventricle, unchanged. There are low lung volumes.  This
accentuates the size of the cardiac silhouette which is likely
mild. The mediastinal contours are unremarkable. There is mild
pulmonary [**Month/Day/Year 1106**] congestion. No pleural effusion or
pneumothorax is present. No focal consolidation is visualized.
There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
IMPRESSION: Pulmonary [**Month/Day/Year 1106**] congestion and low lung volumes.
.
#[**2182-10-18**] TTE: The left atrium is elongated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated. There is moderate symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Due to
suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality
cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is mildly depressed with probable inferior hypokinesis
(LVEF= 45-50%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. The tricuspid valve leaflets are
mildly thickene
