Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1377**]
Chief Complaint:
chest pain/v-fib arrest

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac Catheterization


History of Present Illness:
40 yo M unknown past med hx, presented to [**Hospital **] hospital with
chest pain. He was evaluated at 11:45 pm. No ECG changes,
negative cardiac enzymes. The patient reported constant
substernal chest pressure for 1-2hrs. He was given azithromycin
for PNA (LLL infiltrate on CXR), and the chest pain resolved
after nitro. The pt signed out AMA sometime after midnight. Had
a ventricular fibrillation arrest in the car ride home,
witnessed by his girlfriend who started CPR and called EMS. He
was shocked x 3 and loaded with amiodarone. He was taken back to
the [**Hospital **] hospital, arriving just before 2am. ECG showed NSR
with RBBB, ST elevations in II, III, and aVF, and V5-V6, ST
depressions v1-v3. Heparin, integrelin, ASA, plavix, and
metoprolol were started. He was intubated at the OSH for airway
protection, and since he was agitated and combative in the CT
scan, he was given ativan and succinylcholine and intubated, per
OSH records. The pt was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for cardiac
catheterization, where he arrived at 4:30 am. Thrombolytics were
considered, although not given in part because chest
compressions had been administered.
At catheterization, there was a totally occluded OM1 stented
with cypher.

MR HEAD W/O CONTRAST; MRA BRAIN W/O CONTRAST

Reason: stroke protocol, DWI

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
40 year old man s/p MI with vfib arrest with residual
neurological deficits
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
MRI and MRA of head, stroke protocol, DWI
CLINICAL INFORMATION: Patient with atrial fibrillation and
subdural neurologic deficit for further evaluation.

TECHNIQUE: T1 sagittal, and FLAIR, T2 susceptibility and
diffusion axial images of the brain were acquired. 3D
time-of-flight MRA of the circle of [**Location (un) 431**] was obtained.

FINDINGS BRAIN MRI:

The diffusion images demonstrate no evidence of slow diffusion
to indicate acute infarct. There is no evidence of corpus
territorial infarcts or significant subcortical white matter
disease seen. No evidence of mass effect or midline shift is
identified.

There are extensive soft tissue changes seen in the bilateral
maxillary and sphenoid as well as ethmoid sinuses.

IMPRESSION: No evidence of acute infarct or mass effect. Soft
tissue changes in the paranasal sinuses.

MRA OF THE HEAD:

The head MRA demonstrates normal flow signal within the arteries
of anterior and posterior circulation.

IMPRESSION: Normal MRA of the head.

Approved: SAT [**2164-9-8**] 7:53 PM


Brief Hospital Course:
40 y/o male with presented to OSH with Pulseless VFib after
Acute MI (STEMI) now s/p Cypher stent of totally occuded OM1
with anoxic brain injury from being pulseless for ~15 mins with
slow neurological recovery.
.
Hospital course is reviewed below by problem:
.
1. Neuro: s/p Anoxic brain injury. Head MRI showed no evidence
of ischemic insult.
Per neuro, the pathology is probably deep cortical anoxic injury
difficult to trace on EEG. Patient is minimally communicative,
mental status waxes and wanes, but is able to follow commands
and respond somewhat appropriately.  He does not speak well. Per
neuro, arm shaking was felt to be a component of the anoxic
brain injury not requiring additional therapy at this time.
With time, arm shaking has resolved, but the patient has
developed increased tone in his bilat UE and bilat LE.  Baclofen
was started and the rigidity improved especially in his lower
extremities.  He was able to ambulate with assistance and has
worked with PT and OT and made some progress in being
functional.  He did continue to get agitated overnight, trying
to get out of bed, and had to be given ativan PRN for sleep and
relief of anxiety.  When his fiancee was in the room with him,
the problems have been significantly reduced. In additon, during
his hospital stay, patient experience a "roll-out fall" from his
[**Female First Name (un) **] chair while trying to get up and go to the bathroom.  He
did not sustain any injuries, just minor abrasions and
complained of no residual pain.  It is to be noted that giving
the patient Ambien made him more agitated or sedated and should
be avoided.
.
2. Elevated LFTs.  The patient was noted to have elevated LFTs
upon checking baseline to start the statin treatment.  He was
started on a statin s/p MI and was started on a course of
oxacillin for coag negative staph bacteremia that he developed
during his course.  The pattern was not consistent with shock
liver or liver failure, as INR and albumin stayed WNL.
Hepatology was consulted and determined that the LFT elevations
were probably due to the combination of statin and oxacillin
treatments.  Therefore, the statin was d/c'ed and the course of
oxacillin was completed.  He was also discovered to have Hep C
positivity with a viral load of 81,800 IU/mL.  This was thought
NOT the cause of his LFT elevations, likely an incidental
finding, and no acute inpatient treatment was recommended.
Liver recommended to follow LFT's until they trend down, and
arrange for a follow-up at the [**Hospital1 18**] liver center as an
outpatient ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 2422**]).  During the hospital course, the
patient's LFTs trended down, with the latest labs being: ALT:
215 AP: 180 Tbili: 0.8
AST: 67 LDH: 204 [**Doctor First Name **]: 46 Lip: 19
.
3. Acute MI: STEMI with totally occuded OM1, s/p Cypher stent
with resolution of ST elevations. Patient was started on
aspirin, plavix, metoprolol and statin per post-MI managment.
Statin was d/c'ed as per discussion above, and patient should be
re-challenged with statin as an outpatient.  During the entire
hospital course, the patient remained chest pain free, NSR w/o
ectopy on his EKG.  Aspirin and plavix should be continued
indefinitely and metoprolol may be increased as blood pressure
tolerates.
.
4. HTN: His hypertension has been well controlled on metoprolol
during the hospitalization.
