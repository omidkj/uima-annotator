Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 30**]
Chief Complaint:
Neck Pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Anterior Cervical diskectomy

History of Present Illness:
65Y M ESRD, CHF EF<20% with recuurent Listeria bacteremia X 2,
had complained of neck pain for several weeks. Pt was seen in
the ED treated with IV dilaudid. PT became sensitive and
developed respiratory distress and failure to normal doses of IV
narcotics in the ED. Pt eventually admitted to MICU, scheduled
for C-spine MRI in the setting of unstable respiratory status.
Pt coded in MRI holding underwen limited MRI studies which were
inconclusive. Pt was subsequently intubated for final MRI w/
gado.  MRI eventually was suspicious for osteomyelitis of C4
with inflammation of C3C4, C4C5. Pt wwas scheduled for bone
biosy with tissue cx sent for micro and cyptococcal ag. Pt was
stablized, extubated, received HD after MRI and transferred to
the floor for pain control. Upon transfer, pt desated to 88% on
RA with complaint of SOB but no CP. Pt's HR was 100, increased
to RR 28, BP was 120/74. Pt immediately received O2. O2 was
titrated SpO2 >96%.  Pt also received lopressor 25mg po to
control his rate. Pt was eventually stable on 2L. PT c/o
shoulder pain o/n.

CXR [**2166-12-10**]: no acute cardiopulmonary process. ET tube 2cm above
carina.
[**12-14**]: Right infrahilar consolidation has increased since
[**12-11**] consistent with worsening pneumonia. mid and lower
left lung atelectasis persists.
[**12-15**]: some progressive clearing of the right perihilar and
infrahilar consolidation, consistent with some improvement in
the pneumonia
.
MRI C-spine [**2166-12-10**]: Discitis, osteomyelitis C4 with
paraspinal phlegmon or abscess. Indicative of infectious
etiology. However, rarely florid inflammatory response to renal
spondyloarthopathy may demonstrate a similar picture.

Brief Hospital Course:
65 yo male with a past medical history of CAD, dilated CHF (EF <
20%), Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus, ESRD on HD, COPD, and recent
recurrent bacteremia (GBS bacteremia in [**7-10**] and Listeria
Bacteremia in [**9-9**]) is being transferred to the floor after MICU
admission for respiratory failure.
.
On [**2166-11-27**], patient complained of 3 weeks of neck pain. He
[**Date Range 1834**] an outpatient MRI on [**12-9**] which demonstrated C4-C5
discitis with destructive osteomyelitis, including pre-vertebral
involvement. No epidural abscess was seen at that time. He was
then sent to the ED for further evaluation by neurosurgery,
where he was found to have mild LUE weakness and unchanged
decreased sensation at fingertips and toes. This study was
limited by gado so they perform another MRI.  Repeat MRI w/ gado
on [**12-10**] demonstrated known C4-5 spondylodiscitis, and no
evidence of an epidural component, but the study was limited by
patient motion.
.
Overnight, patient triggered for decreased responsiveness and
decreased SaO2 to 55% RA, increasing to 80% on 5L NC. He was
noted to be snoring at the time. He had received significant
amounts of dilaudid (4mg IV over the past few hours) and ativan
prior to this episode. RR was [**11-16**]. ABG was 7.22/75/99 on 5L NC
(PCO2 significantly above baseline). CXR showed clear lung
fields. 0.2mg Narcan was administered with immediate improvement
in mental status and oxygenation, improving to 98-100% on 5L,
which was quickly weaned. He immediately c/o [**11-12**] pain and
demanded additional pain medicine, and an additional 0.5mg IV
dilaudid was given. He was also noted to intermittently refuse
the hard c-collar.
.
Since the first two MRIs were limited (the first by lack of
gado, the second by motion), a third MRI was done with
anesthesia to definitively assess for epidural abscess. He was
intub
