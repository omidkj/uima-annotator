The patient is a [**Age over 90 **] yo F recently discharged [**2111-12-23**] after
admission initially to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] [**2111-12-20**] with hypercarbic
respiratory acidosis who presented to the ED with 3 days of AMS.
She has been home from rehab for about 6 days. Per family, did
not "do well" and was unhappy at rehab. Has been comnplaining of
abdominal pain for the past 2-3 days. She presented to scheduled
follow up at her PCP's office this morning, where it was
reported that she was hypotensive. She was brought to the ED
from her PCP's office given concern for her BP and mental
status. Per daughters, no fevers, no CP, no SOB although not
very active. Has suspected sleep apnea and desats with sleep,
but family felt that pt would not cooperate with CPAP titration
last admission.  Ms. [**Known lastname 99729**] Lasix had been d/ced last
admission, but family noted that she was recently started back
on a daily dose of Lasix (had previously been on 40mg [**Hospital1 **]).

In ER:
VS: 98.1 61 136/48 18 99% RA
CXR was consistant with CHF exascerbation. She had a CT AP for
nonspecific abdominal pain which showed bilateral pleural
effusions with atelectasis, R > L, but was otherwise no acute
pathology. 1st trop 0.03. UA unremarkable. VBG 7.31/67/39/35.
She recieved 20mg IV furosemide. Given increased lethargy and
somnulence in the ED, she was placed on BiPAP with improvement
in her mental status. Per family report, she was on BiPAP for
about one hour and tolerated it well.
Vitals prior to transfer to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] were HR 54, BP 130/42, RR
20, Sat 99% on [**10-26**] FiO2 40%

In ICU, she was on non-rebreather and was A&O x 1. She was
managed conservatively for 24 hours and then transfered to the
floor.

On the floor, she is on 4L NC and has no complaints, although
she is still only A&O x 1.

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a [**Age over 90 **] year old woman who was recently admitted for
hypercarbia secondary to suspected sleep apnea not on CPAP who
presented with lethargy, pulmonary edema as well as diarrhea.
Her lethargy was suspicious for hypercarbia encephalopathy.  She
was initially treated with BIPAP for one hour in the ED, and
then admitted to the ICU. In the ICU, she was treated with only
oxygen as well as diuresis, and discharged to the floor. She had
a sleep study on the floor, which showed severely disordered
breathing with desaturation, [**Last Name (un) **] [**Doctor Last Name **] breathing, and
apnea. She was started on low dose Provigil 50 mg in the
morning, and this was titrated up to 50 mg twice daily and then
to 100 in AM and 50 at noon with some improvement in her daytime
sleepiness. Before Provigil titration, she had severe apnea with
desaturation on the floor and was transferred back to the ICU
for a trial of BiPAP which she failed. In regards to her
diastolic CHF exacerbation, her CXR findings were from flash
pulmonary edema which also could be related to mitral
regurgitation (no echo in our system; Echo was not done because
of her advanced age and no surgical options). BNP in the ED was
5053. Troponin's were negative for ACS. She was treated with 20
mg IV Lasix and a short course of BiPAP as above. She developed
mild worsening of renal function in the setting of diuresis. Her
Lasix was decreased to 20 mg every other day and then 40 mg
daily and her creatinine was stable on this oral Lasix. In
regards to her acute encephalopathy, it was related to
hypercapnia and poor sleep from sleep apnea/obesity
hypoventilation syndrome. This has resolved completely. She,
however, developed catheter associated UTI. On hospital day 4,
after discontinuation of her Foley catheter, she developed
incontinence and foul smelling urine. It grew out pan sensitive
E coli, and she was treated with ciprofloxacin 250 mg po daily
for 7 days.  Despite initial diarrhea, C Diff was negative and
she subsequently developed formed stools. I spent more than 30
minutes with her daughter daily to discuss prognosis, short life
expectancy, and appropriate discharge plans. Family decided for
home discharge with 24 hour care and strong consideration for
hospice. She is at high risk for rehospitalization unless she is
in a hospice program because of short life expectancy, advanced
age, and very poor functional status.  She was DNR/DNI and her
emergency contact was  [**Name (NI) **],[**First Name3 (LF) **] her DAUGHTER and HCP.
