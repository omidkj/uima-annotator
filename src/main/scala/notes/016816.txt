approx 21:15. CT head done at 22:30 showed large left anterior

lateral ventricle; midline shift apparent.


Brief Hospital Course:
Pt was admitted to the neurosurgical service and then
transferred to the neurology service on HD 3 because of the lack
of any possible interventions for the patient.

Her hospital course by system:

Neuro: Pt was started on dilantin. She was weaned off all
sedating meds but continued to have significantly depressed
mental status, only posturing to deep stimulation. An EEG was
performed on [**9-24**] that showed diffuse slowing with no
epileptiform activity. LFT's and ammnonia were also checked and
were normal.  Her exam remained essentially unchanged during her
course.

CV: Pt initially on labetolol drop which was weaned [**12-30**], after
which she was given PRN hydralazine and lopressor for any
Systolic BP's greater than 160.  She remained stable on these
medications for the remainder of her course

RESP: Pt was dependent on mechanical ventilation throughout her
course. She did develop a ventilator associated pneumonia for
which she was treated with vancomycin and zosyn.

ID: Pt began to be febrile on [**12-20**], cultures from [**12-21**] and
[**12-23**] positive. Sputum positive for coag + staph and klebsiella,
urine positive for coag - staph and enterococcus. She was
started on vancomycin and zosyn. [**12-27**] follow up cultures showed
negative urine but sputum positive for staph aureus.
Antibiotics continued throughout her course. Her fever curve
improved over the course of her stay.

FEN/GI: Pt started on NG tube feeds of promote w/ fiber that she
tolerated well. She did have some hypernatremia that was
addressed by increased free water boluses and decreasing
infusions of IV NS.  She was continued on protonix during her
stay.

ENDO: Pt was on an insulin sliding scale with stable d sticks
throughout course.

DISPO: Multiple discussions with pt's husband were held
regarding her neurologic status and poor prognosis. He seemed to
understand her situation but was very reluctant to make her CMO.
Family meeting held again on [**1-2**] and the decision was made to
make her CMO on [**1-2**] afternoon. She was extubated at that time.
 Time of death: 4:13pm on [**2122-1-3**].  Husband was present.
Denied autopsy.
