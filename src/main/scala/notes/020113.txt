LABORATORY DATA:  In the MICU, white count 12.8, 14.4
hemoglobin, 42.4 hematocrit, platelet count 252,000.  [**Name (NI) 2591**],
PT 12.0, PTT 24.1, INR 1.  ABG, 7.39, PO2 43, PCO2 107,
sodium 140, potassium 4.1, chloride 98, CO2 31, BUN 24,
creatinine 1, glucose 93, CK was 42.  Chest x-ray showed no
acute cardiopulmonary pathology, no infiltrates.  The cardiac
silhouette was unchanged and there were no effusions seen.
EKG showed patient in atrial fibrillation, heart rate 140's,
minimal left axis deviation, [**Street Address(2) 4793**] depression in V4 to V6.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  Pulmonary:  The patient was started on Levaquin 500 mg q
d for a 7 day course because of history of infection.  The
patient was also started on nebulizers and continued on his
Flovent.  The patient was started on Prednisone 60 mg q d
with a taper every 3-4 days by 20 mg.  The patient continued
to require oxygen during his hospital course but clinically
started to feel a lot better.  He had excessive amounts of
sputum which would be suctioned and/or patient would cough
out.  Additionally, the patient's trach was opened and would
on occasion have sputum and exudate within.  A speech and
swallow study was done on day of discharge and patient was at
considerable risk for aspiration pneumonia.  Recommendations
were that patient get nectar thick liquids with soft moist
solids, sit 90 degrees upright, one sip per mouthful and
patient might need to consider alternate route for nutrition,
however, patient was resistant to this idea.  Additionally,
patient should have his medications crushed and administered
with applesauce.  Sputum cultures did grow out pseudomonas,
however, it was decided that after consulting ID, that this
was probably colonization as opposed to infection.
Determination was made not to place patient on Ceftazidime as
this might prove to grow resistant strains of pseudomonas or
subsequent infections.  The patient was retained on Levaquin.

2.  Cardiovascular:  Stable.  Patient has atrial fibrillation
and CAD, however, patient has not been anticoagulated
secondary to his history of iliopsoas bleed.  The patient is
on Verapamil and Isordil.

3.  Endocrine:  The patient was placed on a regular insulin
sliding scale and fingersticks were checked regularly
secondary to him being on steroids.

4.  Renal:  Patient stable with creatinine at baseline.

5.  GI:  Patient was stable.

6.  Infectious Disease:  The patient did have a bump in his
white count secondary to Prednisone, however, it came back
down to normal on day of discharge.  As discussed earlier,
patient was not placed on Ceftazidime or Tobramycin for his
pseudomonas as it was felt by ID that this was probably
colonization as opposed to active infection.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  Levaquin 500 mg po q d to be stopped
on [**2202-2-15**], Verapamil 40 mg po tid, Isordil 10 mg po tid,
Dulcolax 10 mg po bid prn, TUMS 500 mg po q d, Protonix 40 mg

po q d, Albuterol, Atrovent nebulizers q 4 hours, Flovent 110
mcg four puffs [**Hospital1 **], Prednisone 40 mg po q d, stop on [**2202-2-12**],
then 20 mg po q d, stop on [**2202-2-16**], then 10 mg po q d, stop
on [**2202-2-20**].

DISCHARGE PLAN:  The patient is to return to [**Hospital1 2670**] with
the following recommendations, that he get fingersticks [**Hospital1 **]
while on Prednisone treatment and to follow the
recommendations for aspiration precautions and patient will
follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1266**].
