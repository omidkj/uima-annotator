CT ABD & PELVIS W/O CONTRAST ([**2195-1-24**])
1. Approximately 8 x 6 cm pelvic fluid collection with gas and
fecalized
contrast, concerning for adjacent bowel leak.
2. Findings consistent with acute tubular necrosis/renal
dysfunction with
retained IV contrast from exam two days prior.
3. Dense filling defects in a prominent CBD with mild
intrahepatic biliary
dilatation, unchanged. The differential includes sludge or
stones, but
metastatic implantation cannot be excluded.
4. New left lung base atelectasis and consolidation which may
reflect
superimposed pneumonia.

Brief Hospital Course:
1. Sepsis / Pelvic fluid collection. Secondary to chronic bowel
leak. Admission lactate of 6.5 normalised following fluid
resuscitation. Treated with broad spectrum antibiotics (IV
vancomycin and meropenem) given a history of ESBL E. Coli in
pelvic abscess and oral metronidazole; 2 week course is planned
with final day [**2195-2-6**].

It was unclear regarding the patient's wishes as on discussion
with his surgeon, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], he had previously mentioned that
he did not want further surgery. As his rectal cancer was in
remission and that IR drainage may provide bridge to surgery,
this was pursued. He had a drain placed into his pelvic
collection on [**1-25**]. There were no complications and drained
feculent material which was cultured and grew mixed flora. On
[**1-28**] post extubation, his pelvic drainage decreased. CT abdomen
showed that the left posterior drainage pigtail catheter was
withdrawn such that the tip was in the posterior
gluteus/subcutaneous tissues. After discussion with IR, his
catheter was cut and removed. It was difficult to insert and
they felt that given the complexity of the case that surgical
treatment should first be sought. Latterly, surgery felt no
further surgical intervention was necessary at this time
although this may be revisited in the future.

2. Encephalopathy. On [**1-24**], patient became progressively
confused and was severely agitated requiring restraints, speech
became unintelligible and he had severe whole body tremors with
evidence of mild tetany. He also had abnormal eye movements
which where darting from randomly without evidence of nystagmus
or restriction in eye movement. On reviewing his severe
metabolic derangements, he was found to have severe
hypomagnesemia (0.3) and hypocalcemia (4.8) which were the
likely cause of confusion (metabolic encephalopathy), tremors
and eye signs. These were repleted with IV magnesium and calcium
aggressively and normalised. For periodic agitation, haloperidol
was used.

3. Aflutter/AF: On presentation he was noted to be tachycardic
in Aflutter with variable block but given concomitant agitation
and severe metabolic derangement he was initially treated with
IV metoprolol and was fluid resuscitated. Due to borderline BPs
