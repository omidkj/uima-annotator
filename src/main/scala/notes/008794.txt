Admission Date:  [**2139-5-8**]       Discharge Date:  [**2139-6-9**]

Date of Birth:   [**2085-1-5**]       Sex:  F

Service:  [**First Name9 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) **]

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 54-year-old
woman who developed Hodgkin's disease and was treated with
mantle irradiation in [**2110**].  She did well with regard to her
Hodgkin's disease but developed congestive heart failure and
was found to have constrictive pericarditis and underwent a
pericardectomy at the [**Hospital 9940**] Clinic in the early [**2126**]'s.  In
[**2133**] she developed worsening shortness of breath and
ultimately was admitted to the [**Hospital1 188**] in [**2138-4-7**] with respiratory distress and was found
to have bilateral fibrothoraces.  On [**2138-6-11**], she
underwent a left thoracotomy with decortication of the severe
left fibrothorax with an excellent anatomic result.  Her
postoperative course was complicated requiring tracheostomy
and a feeding tube.  After being discharged to rehabilitation
she suffered a respiratory arrest from a mucus plug and was
resuscitated and transferred back.  Since that time she has
had recurrent admissions for respiratory insufficiency
requiring multiple bronchoscopies and an extensive workup.
It appears clear that she has severe restrictive physiology
resulting in severe respiratory insufficiency as a result of
recurrent fibrothorax with a pleural RIND.  She also appears
to have some trapped lung due to this fibrothorax which is
resulting in chronic ventilatory dependence.  She is being
admitted for right-sided decortication.

ALLERGIES:  IV contrast which results in anaphylaxis.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  She is single, has no children and is a
retired professor [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 9929**] at a local college.  She is a
nonsmoker.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  She was alert and oriented with normal
vital signs.  She was breathing through her trach mask
without distress and talking without any problems.  [**Name (NI) **]
signs:  Temperature 99.1, heart rate 87, blood pressure
90/69, 99% sats on the trach mask.  Sclerae anicteric.  Her
neck has no cervical adenopathy.  Lungs are clear to
auscultation bilaterally without crackles or wheezes.  Her
heart is regular without any murmurs.  She has a well-healed
left thoracotomy scar.  Abdomen is benign.  Extremities have
no clubbing or edema.

RADIOLOGY:  Chest CT scan shows pulmonary fibrosis on the
medial aspect of both lungs from the mediastinal and
radiotherapy.  She has chronic scarring in both lungs from
recurrent infections.  There are no pleural effusions.  There
are no significant areas of atelectasis.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  On [**2139-5-8**], the patient was taken to
the Operating Room for a right lung decortication.  This was
a prolonged surgery which was technically very difficult and
the patient required eight units of fresh frozen plasma, nine
units of packed red blood cells and 18 units of platelets for
an estimated blood loss of four liters.  She tolerated the
procedure and was transferred to the Surgical Intensive Care
Unit postoperatively where she was closely monitored on the
ventilator and required pressor support.  On [**5-14**] she
returned to the Operating Room for a evacuation of a
right-sided hemothorax and washout.  She had no further
return trips to the Operating Room and had a prolonged one
month hospitalization which will be summarized by systems.

1.  Neurologic:  The patient did well.  Her pain was
initially controlled on intravenous narcotics and has now
been weaned to p.o. hydromorphone which she appears to be
tolerating well.  She also continues on her Zoloft for her
chronic depression.

2.  Cardiac:  All of her pressors were weaned after her
postoperative resuscitation.  She now remains hemodynamically
stable with a systolic blood pressure in the 100 range and a
heart rate of approximately 100.  Her beta blocker had not
been restarted but we are considering restarting that now.

3.  Pulmonary:  She underwent chest tube drains of her right
hemothorax until the chest tube drainage decreased and the
tubes were all eventually removed.  She was gradually weaned
from the ventilator and she currently tolerates being off the
ventilator for a 24 hour period but as a means of assuring
expansion of her lung and expression of any excess of fluid,
she is placed on the ventilator for two hour periods twice a
day on vent settings with very high peak inspiratory
pressures as per the protocol outlined by respiratory
therapists.  Her respiratory status has been stable and her
sats are 95% on the 50% face mask.  She had an excellent
re-expansion of her lung postoperatively and should do well
long term.

4.  Gastrointestinal:  The patient has been experiencing
prolonged nausea and it is unclear what the etiology of her
nausea is.  She has no evidence for any intra-abdominal ileus
or obstruction.  She is being fed via a nasogastric feeding
tube at a goal rate of 70 cc/hour but due to the fact that
she has ongoing nausea, she has not been taking a p.o. diet
although there is no reason why she cannot.  She continues on
Pepcid 20 mg b.i.d. and Zofran around the clock.

5.  Genitourinary:  The patient has been aggressively
diuresed to her baseline weight.  At the time of discharge
her BUN and creatinine are at her baseline of 17/0.5.  She is
not currently on any diuretics.

6.  Hematology:  Her hematocrit has been stable at 35 as are
her coags with a PT of 12.9 and PTT of 49.9 and INR of 1.1.
She continues on subcutaneous heparin for DVT prophylaxis and
has had no problems with any ongoing bleeding since the time
of her initial operation.

7.  Infectious Disease:  The patient has been maintained on
broad spectrum intravenous antibiotics throughout her
hospitalization.  Her cultures from the Operating Room have
grown methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and
__________________________ and [**Female First Name (un) 564**] torulopsis.  She has
also tested positive for Clostridium difficile, as she has in
the past.  She is currently being treated on intravenous
vancomycin, intravenous Bactrim, intravenous fluconazole and
p.o. vancomycin.  The plan is to keep her on this regimen for
a total of a three week course which will be completed on
[**2139-6-14**].  After that date she will continue on her p.o.
vancomycin for two more weeks due to her recurrent
Clostridium difficile.  She has no active infectious problems
with a temperature of 97.4 and a white count of 12.7.

8.  Endocrine:  The patient has hypothyroidism and is
currently on Synthroid which will be increased to 125 mcg a
day as this is her standard dose.  Throughout her
hospitalization she has been treated with steroids to try to
minimize the fibrotic reaction within her right lung.  Due to
the fact she has improved and she is now one month out from
surgery, the plan is to wean her off of her steroids.  On
[**6-8**], we obtained an Endocrinology consult who outlined a
tapering for her prednisone from 30 mg p.o. q. day down to 20
mg p.o. q. day for two days, then 10 mg p.o. q. day for two
days, then 5 mg p.o. q. day.  After weaning her down to 5 mg
for approximately one week, the patient will require repeat
Cortrosyn stimulation test.  Based on the results of this, if
the corti
