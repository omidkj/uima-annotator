Pertinent Results:
[**2158-12-14**] ECHO
Pre bypass: The ascending aorta and arch are moderately dilated.
There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the aortic arch. There is a
dissection flap in the asending aorta through the mid arch.
There is a communication between the lumens in the mid arch with
flow seen at a postion approximately 3 cm from the left
subclavian. This is suspicous as the probable origin of the
dissection. The flap terminates at the sinotubular junction
wihout involvement of the sinus of valsalva. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is no aortic valve
stenosis. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is a very small pericardial
effusion without evidence for tampanode.

Post bypass: There is a prosthesis seen in the ascending aorta
and arch with normal flow profiles. The aortic valve is native
and has mild aortic insufficiency. LVEF remains normal.
Remaining exam is unchanged. All findings discussed with
surgeons at the time of the exam.

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:74 [**Last Name (un) **] s/p ao arch replacement
Final Report
In comparison with study of [**12-18**], the patient has taken a better

inspiration and there is slightly less opacification at the
bases.
Nevertheless, there is still probable small bilateral pleural
effusions with associated compressive atelectasis. No evidence
of pulmonary vascular
congestion.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2158-12-14**] for emergent
repair of a type A aortic dissection. She was taken directly to
the operating room where she underwent repair of a type A aortic
dissection, resuspension of her aortic valve and replacement of
her ascending aorta and total arch. Please see operative note
for details. Postoperatively she was taken to the intensive care
unit for monitoring. She was transfused for postoperative
anemia. A bronchoscopy was performed for right lower lobe
collapse. On postoperative day two, she awoke neurologically
intact and was extubated. Her blood pressure was strictly
controlled. She had an episode of atrial fibrillation which
converted back to normal sinus rhythm with beta blockade. She
was gently diuresed towards her preoperative weight. The
physical therapy service was consulted for assistance with her
postoperative strength and mobility. On postoperative day four,
she was transferred to the step down unit for further recovery.
Chest tubes and pacing wires were removed per cardiac surgery
protocol.  She remained in sinus rhythm with PVC's on the floor.
 Lasix was increased for further diuresis.  On post operative
day 7 her incisions were healing well, she was tolerating a full
oral diet and she was ambulating with assistance.  She was
discharged to rehabilitation at [**Hospital **] Health Care in [**Location (un) 5028**],
MA with all appropriate follow up appointments arranged.  She is
to have a CTA of the torso before her appointment with Dr
[**Last Name (STitle) 914**], which has been scheduled.
