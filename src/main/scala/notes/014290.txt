Service: CARDIOTHORACIC

Allergies:
Penicillin G

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 165**]
Chief Complaint:
49 M healthy male at [**Location (un) **], found to have [**5-21**] blood cultures
with staphylococcus bacteremia. On TTE mitral valve vegetations
were seen along withs severe MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] leaflet. Patient being
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for CT surgery evaluation and further
management.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2113-1-27**] Mitral Valve Replacement(29mm St. [**Male First Name (un) 923**] Mechanical
Valve) with Debridement of Aortic Valve


History of Present Illness:
49 M heavy smoker presented to [**Hospital3 7569**] ER with fever,
fatigue and malaise on [**1-13**] of 3 days duration. He was febrile
to 101.5 in ER with HR 140s, BP 104/44, RR 22, 90% RA.
On labs WBC 16 with 35% bandemia, plt 79, HCT 51. He was
admitted on Friday night and developed a fever to 101.6 and
visual changes which prompted a CT head which showed small
infarct in the anterior and posterior circulation suspicious for
septic emboli. During this time his blood cultures from the ER
came back with 4/4 bottles positive for staph aureus. He
underwent a TTE which showed large vegetation on the mitral
valve and [**Month/Year (2) **] leaflet with severe MR. [**Name13 (STitle) **] has been on
vancomycin, CTX, and levofloxacin. The patient was transferred
to the ICU on Saturday for hypotension, tachycardia and had a SC
triple lumen catheter placed under sterile conditions and is on
Levophed for support. He was ruled out for influenza.
On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
He denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other
review of systems were negative.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,
ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.
Echocardiogram showed severe MR [**First Name (Titles) 151**] [**Last Name (Titles) **] posterior leaflet.
Some hazy densities seen on the mitral valve, while not entirely
clear that they are vegetations,in the setting of his clinical
picture, most likely he has
endocarditis. Cardiac surgery consulted for Mitral Valve
Replacement/Aortic Valve debridement.

Imaging:
[**2113-1-15**] CXR:
Severe emphysema, bilateral pleural effusions, and adjacent
atelectasis.

[**2113-1-15**] CT head w/o contrast:
Suboptimal study due to motion. Multiple bilateral and supra-
and infratentorial hypodense foci, of varying size and degree of
definition. In this setting, these very likely represent embolic
infarcts from a central source, of varying ages. There is no
evidence of hemorrhagic conversion

[**2113-1-16**] ECHO:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. No atrial septal defect
is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity is mildly
dilated. [Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely
more depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
There is no ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber
size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic root is mildly
dilated at the sinus level. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are
mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. There is a
probable (very small) vegetation on the aortic valve. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. There is moderate/severe mitral valve
prolapse (predominantly posterior leaflet). There is probably
partial mitral leaflet [**Month/Day/Year **] of the posterior leaflet. There is
a probable vegetation on the mitral valve. An eccentric,
anteriorly directed jet of moderate to severe (3+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure
could not be determined. There is no pericardial effusion

[**2113-1-16**] CT abdoman:
Bilateral wedge-shaped defects of the renal parenchyma
concerning for septic emboli in the setting of endocarditis. 3.o
cm lesion in the mid right kidney is likely a phlegmonous area.
Renal vessel patency cannot be assessed due to suboptimal bolus
timing and patient motion.
2. Unchanged bilateral pleural effusions and adjacent
atelectasis.
3. Ascites and anasarca.
4. Tiny foci of air in the urinary bladder, which may be due to
instrumentation.

[**2113-1-16**] R elbow Xray:
Elbow joint effusion, no radiographic evidence of osteomyelitis

[**2113-1-17**]: CTA head/neck:
1. Multifocal evolving infarcts, with the most significant
interval change representing a progressive large left posterior
cerebral artery infarct.
2. Slightly attenuated left posterior cerebral artery without
focal
abnormality or intracranial aneurysm or vascular malformation.
3. It should be noted that CTA is not an ideal method for
evaluation of
mycotic aneurysms. Minor vascular abnormalities of vessels
distal to the
circle of [**Location (un) 431**] can be better evaulated with conventional
angiography.

[**2113-1-19**] CT head:
No acute hemorrhage. Evolving multifocal infarcts. No new areas
of hypodensity to suggest a new infarct

[**2113-1-20**] CT abd/pelvis:
1. Limited study due to lack of intravenous contrast. The known
renal
parenchymal defects concerning for infarcts are not well
evaluated on this
study.
2. No
