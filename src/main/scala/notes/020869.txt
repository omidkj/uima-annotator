PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Vitals signs:  97.8,
blood pressure 117/64, heart rate 72, respiratory rate 18,
oxygen saturation 97% on room air.  General: The patient was
a well-developed, well-nourished, very pleasant man in no
acute distress.  HEENT:  Normocephalic, atraumatic.  Sclerae
were anicteric.  The pupils were equal, round, and reactive
to light and accommodation.  Extraocular movements intact.
Neck:  Supple, no lymphadenopathy, no thyromegaly.  Chest:
Clear to auscultation bilaterally.  The patient was noted to
have two puncture sites that were well healed at the right
upper chest from prior Perma-Cath placements.  Cardiac:
Normal S1, S2, regular rate and rhythm.  Abdomen:  Soft,
nontender.  The liver was not palpable.  There was a large
well healed scar from his transplant.  Extremities:  Without
edema, 2+ PT pulses bilaterally, 1+ palpable radial on the
left.  There was a left AV fistula with bruit and thrill.

LABORATORY/RADIOLOGIC DATA:  White count 15.2, hematocrit
34.9, platelets 409,000, INR 1.0.  Sodium 142, potassium 4.4,
BUN 20, creatinine 5.4, AST 15, ALT 15, alkaline phosphatase
68, T bilirubin 0.2, TSH 0.78, albumin 3.4, calcium 9.1,
phosphate 5.4.

Preoperative chest x-ray indicated no cardiopulmonary
process.  A Persantine study in [**2167-1-31**] indicated no
angina or ischemic EKG changes.  A MIBI study was without
perfusion defects and indicated a 46% ejection fraction.

An echocardiogram in [**2167-1-31**] showed a left atrial
dilation, mild LVH, left ventricular function was low normal.
Laboratories were normal.  There was mild dilatation of the
aortic arch.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient is a 42-year-old male status
post liver transplant in [**2156**] secondary to hepatitis B
cirrhosis who now presented to the [**Hospital6 649**] on [**2167-6-16**] with end-stage renal disease
secondary to either FK506 toxicity or IgA nephropathy.  He
also has hypertension.

He underwent a living related kidney transplant on [**2167-6-16**] from his sister.  The procedure was uncomplicated.  His
initial postoperative course was unremarkable.  By
postoperative day number three, he was 7 liters positive.
His creatinine was down to 6.2 from 8 at admission.  Later
that day, he developed increasing shortness of breath and he
dropped his oxygen saturations to 92%.  He demonstrated a P02
of 62.  A chest x-ray was obtained at that time which
demonstrated pulmonary edema.  An EKG and cardiac
echocardiogram was negative.

He was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit and placed on a
nitroglycerin drip, CPAP and Lasix.  Over the next 24 hours,
he was aggressively diuresed despite being negative by 2
liters for 24 hours.  His symptoms did not improve.  He was
empirically started on broad spectrum antibiotics.  An
echocardiogram at that time obtained demonstrated normal
ejection fraction.  No valvular abnormalities and normal left
ventricular wall thickness.  Despite antibiotics and
aggressive diuresis, he required intubation on postoperative
day number five.  Bronchoscopy at that time showed thick
secretions.

Over the next five days, he was diuresed and supported until
he was extubated on postoperative day number nine.  At that
point, he remained extubated in the ICU and his creatinine
had decreased to 2.7.  Psychiatry had consulted on the
patient for agitation which eventually resolved.  A head CT
at the time was obtained which was normal.  The patient had
hypernatremia with a free water deficit of around 4 liters
for which he was given D5W and it eventually resolved.  The
patient was transferred to the floor on postoperative day
number 18.  He had a slight increase in his creatinine from
2.6 to 2.9 for which a biopsy was performed which was read as
as noted which is consistent with acute failure rejection.
However, the granulomatous inflammation was not typical of
failure rejection and its significant was unclear.  The team
thought that he was clear for discharge with adequate
follow-up by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] from the Renal Department.

By postoperative day number 16, the patient was ambulating,
tolerating solids, and was stable for discharge.  The patient
did leave the hospital before discharge papers were
finalized.  However, we contact[**Name (NI) **] the patient and the patient
returned to review discharge medications and discharge
instructions as well as follow-up visits.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  Stable.

nephropathy, status post living related kidney transplant on
[**2167-6-16**] for which he has had excellent graft function.
2.  Postoperative pulmonary edema requiring reintubation.
3.  Hyponatremia.
4.  Status post liver transplant, excellent liver graft
function, in [**2156**].
5.  Hypertension.
6.  Depression/anxiety.

8.  Reglan 10 mg tablet p.o. q.i.d.
9.  Prednisone 20 mg tablet p.o. q.d.
10. Wellbutrin 100 mg tablet, two tablets p.o. q.d.
11. Sertraline 100 mg tablet p.o. q.d.
