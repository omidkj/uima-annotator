Service:  FENARD ICU

HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 73-year-old male
with Non-Hodgkin lymphoma diagnosed in [**2103-2-16**] and recent
radiation therapy to spine.  History of coronary artery
disease status post CABG and MI in [**2100**].  The patient
presents with hypotension and nausea, requiring dopamine
pressors.

The patient has a recent admission to [**Hospital1 190**] from [**4-9**] to [**4-18**] for right upper lobe
pneumonia and left arm cellulitis.  He was treated with
oxacillin, which was changed to dicloxacillin for cellulitis
and Levaquin for right upper lobe pneumonia.  The patient was
also found to be adrenally insufficient and had some episodes
with hypotension and orthostasis during that admission.

On the day of admission the patient was at his second
radiation therapy session, when he became lethargic,
diaphoretic, and hypotension.  He was taken to [**Location (un) **]
Emergency Room, where he was found to be afebrile with pulse
of 60 and blood pressure 104/51.  He was saturating 93% on a
nonrebreather.  Fingersticks 68.  The patient then dropped
his systolic blood pressure to the low 70s at which time he
was given Narcan, normosaline bolus, and hydrocortisone 100
mg times one.  There was little response to these therapies
and the patient was started on Ceftriaxone and Vancomycin for
presumptive sepsis.  The patient's pressures did not improve
and therefore, he required a Dopamine drip.  The EKG at the
outside hospital showed on significant change and no evidence
of ischemia.  CK and troponin were negative times one.

When the patient arrived to [**Hospital1 188**] MICU he was mentating but lethargic with systolic
blood pressures from 110 to 130s on dopamine drip at 15 mcg
per kilogram per minute.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  The patient denied any complaints.  The
patient was unable to remember the recent events since that
morning.  The patient denied any chest pain, shortness of
breath, cough, nauseas, vomiting, diarrhea, headache, vision
changes, abdominal pain, numbness, weakness, tingling,
fevers, chills, bright red blood per rectum, or melena.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Noncontributory.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  No tobacco or alcohol.  The patient is a
retired business man with three kids and he lived with his
wife prior to requiring rehabilitation since [**Month (only) 958**].

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Examination revealed the following:
Temperature 99.4, blood pressure 134/79, heart rate 85,
respiratory rate 16, 91% on four liters nasal cannula, weight
54.6 kg.  GENERAL:  The patient was alert and oriented times
three, lethargic at times, but arousable.  HEENT:
Normocephalic, atraumatic.  PERRLA.  Mucous membranes dry.
NECK:  No lymphadenopathy or jugulovenous distention.  LUNGS:
Lungs were clear to auscultation anteriorly, no wheezes,
rales, or rhonchi.  BACK:  Healing spinal scar, no erythema
or fluctuance.  CARDIOVASCULAR:  Regular rate and rhythm.
Normal S1 and S2, 2/6 systolic ejection murmur at the apex,
no S3 or S4.  ABDOMEN:  Old right upper quadrant scar, soft,
nontender, nondistended, positive bowel sounds, no
hepatosplenomegaly.  RECTAL:  Guaiac negative.  No perirectal
abscesses.  EXTREMITIES:  Right upper extremity mottled and
1+ nonpitting edema.  (peripheral IV with dopamine in place).
Extremities cool.  No other evidence of edema except for the
right upper extremity.  NEUROLOGICAL:  The patient responds
to commands, moves all extremities spontaneously.

LABORATORY DATA:  White count:  7.0, hematocrit 36.3,
platelet count 354,000 with differential of 86% neutrophils,
4% bands, 4 lymphs, and 2 atypical lymphs.  Coagulations:  PT
12.6, INR 1.1.  Chem 7:  Sodium 131, potassium 4.6, chloride

Additional labs from outside hospital on [**2103-4-20**] revealed
the first CK of 35, troponin less than 0.3, LFTs within
normal limits, albumin 2.0.  EKG from outside hospital showed
normal sinus rhythm with normal axis, normal intervals with
nonspecific T-wave abnormalities.  Chest x-ray on admission
showed the following:  Right lower lobe opacification and
probably small effusion.

IMPRESSION:  This is a 73-year-old male with Non-Hodgkin
lymphoma and history of CABG/MI presenting with hypotension
requiring pressors.

HOSPITAL COURSE:

#1.  CARDIOVASCULAR:  The patient has a history of coronary
artery disease status post CABG and MI now with hypotension
and question of reported chest pressure, nausea, and
diaphoresis.  EKG did not show any evidence of ischemia.  The
patient ruled out by enzymes times three.  He remained chest
pain free during the hospital stay.  Therefore, cardiac cause
of hypotension was unlikely.  The patient did appear to be
intravascularly depleted with dry mucous membranes and
history of orthostasis.  The patient was given several
boluses of normal saline and pressure started to improve with
rehydration.  The patient was weaned off dopamine on day #2
of stay and maintained adequate pressures for the rest of his
hospital stay.

#2.  PULMONARY:  The patient has recent admission with right
upper lobe pneumonia treated with a seven-day course of
Levaquin.  On chest x-ray from this admission the patient had
right upper lobe and right lower lobe infiltrates.  The
patient received three days of Ceftriaxone therapy and then
was changed to Cefpodoxime to complete a ten-day antibiotic
course.  The patient maintained good oxygen saturations.  On
admission he was requiring four liters to saturation over
92%.  At the time of discharge he was saturating well on room
air.  He denied any complaints of cough, shortness of breath
or chest pain.  He remained afebrile during the entire
hospital stay.  The patient's Vancomycin was discontinued
after two days when the patient no longer appeared to be
septic.  Treatment was changed to just empiric coverage for
community-acquired pneumonia versus aspiration pneumonia with
the third generation cephalosporin as above.

#3.  INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  As above in pulmonary section.  In
addition, blood cultures were sent secondary to question of
sepsis.  Urinalysis was found to be negative.  The patient
has a bandemia, but low white blood cell possibly secondary
to immunocompromise.  As stated above, the patient remained
afebrile during the hospital stay and once his intravascular
status was repleted, he maintained good blood pressures,
therefore, making sepsis as an etiology much less likely.
Urine culture and blood cultures times two showed no growth
to date times 72 hours.

#4.  GASTROINTESTINAL:  The patient has history of
constipation and question of malabsorption syndrome.  LFTs
were within normal limits from outside hospital.  The patient
has history of psychiatric obsession with bowels per report.
The patient was maintained on an aggressive bowel regimen
including Colace, Dulcolax, and Lactulose.

#5.  GENITOURINARY:  The patient has history
