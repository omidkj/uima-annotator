History of Present Illness:
75 yo F with h/o CAD, afib, PE's on anticoagulation and chronic
back pain presents after a fall. The pt reports that she recalls
being in bed last night, and noticing that the night light that
she wears around her neck had gotten intertwined with the
lifeline button she wears, and she thinks she may have thought
that she dropped it on the floor and went looking for it. The
next part that she remembers she is on the floor of the bedroom,
trying to get up multiple times and hitting various parts of her
body on the brass bed frame. She has never experienced weakness
like this and denies any difficulty with ambulation or balance
usually. She had gone on a trip to NH and [**State 1727**] on Saturday and
did extensive walking. On Sunday she slept most of the day
(which was unusual for her) and she noted a new cough and chest
congestion, but did not produce anything with the cough. She
denies fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, or urinary symptoms. She
did recently have a facet block/epidural injection of the lumbar
back for pain on [**7-16**], and has felt well since then.
.
This morning the pt's dtr found the patient on the floor at
home. The pt reports she had had a normal BM during the time she
was on the floor, and was unable to get up to go to the
bathroom. Pt was then brought to the ED.
.
In the ED, initial vs were: 97.5 95 88/39 16 98%. Due to
hypotension, blood cx and urine cx were sent and the patient was
given 500cc NS, vancomycin and zosyn. CT abd/pelvis and CThead
were unremarkable for any acute changes. Chest xray showed right
upper >lower lobe consolidation concerning for pna v ca. FAST
scan in ED was negative. Labs were notable for elevated troponin
to 0.15, and leukocytosis of 14. Pt was admitted to the ICU for
further monitoring of hypotension.
.
Review of sytems:
(+) Per HPI
(-) Denies fever, chills, night sweats, recent weight loss or
gain. Denies headache, sinus tenderness, rhinorrhea or
congestion. Denied cough, shortness of breath. Denied chest pain
or tightness, palpitations. Denied nausea, vomiting, diarrhea,

Imaging:
[**2151-7-20**]
- CT head: There is no evidence of intracranial hemorrhage,
edema, shift of normally midline structures, hydrocephalus, or
acute large vascular territorial infarction. Periventricular and
subcortical white matter
hypodensities are consistent with chronic small vessel ischemic
disease. Mild prominence of ventricles and sulci are consistent
with age-related
involutional change. Calcifications are seen in the bilateral
carotid
siphons. There are aerosolized secretions within the left
sphenoid sinus.
Scattered ethmoidal air cell mucosal thickening is seen
bilaterally. The
remainder of the visualized portions of the paranasal sinuses
and mastoid air cells are well aerated. No fractures are
identified.
IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial process.

- CT C-spine: There is no evidence of fracture or change in
alignment compared to [**2150-8-10**]. There is no prevertebral
edema or hematoma. Multilevel degenerative changes are noted
including marked disc space narrowing at C3-4 and C4-5. Grade 1
anterolisthesis of C2 on C3 is unchanged. Minimal
anterolisthesis of C6 on C7 is also unchanged. There is
multilevel uncovertebral and facet joint hypertrophy causing
varying degrees of neural foraminal narrowing. Please refer to
the MR report from [**2150-8-10**] for complete review of
level-by-level degenerative changes.  There are no
pathologically enlarged lymph nodes within the cervical region.
Bilateral carotid artery calcifications are noted. Prominence of
the thyroid isthmus does not appear significantly changed
compared to CT from [**2150-1-13**]. Aside from mild
pleuro-parenchymal scarring at the lung apices, the visualized
portions of the lungs are unremarkable.
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of fracture or change in alignment.
2. Multilevel degenerative changes of the cervical spine, as
described above.
3. Prominence of the thyroid isthmus, not significantly changed
compared to CT from [**2150-1-13**].

- CT abd/pelvis:  ABDOMEN CT: A 5-mm nodule in the right middle
lobe (2:5) is not significantly changed in appearance compared
to the prior study from [**2151-5-31**]. Aside from minimal right
basilar dependent atelectasis, the remainder of the visualized
portions of the lungs is unremarkable. Coronary artery
calcifications are seen.  The liver is normal appearing. The
portal vein is patent. There is mild intrahepatic biliary duct
dilatation, not significantly changed. The gallbladder is
distended and there are stones seen within dependent portion of
its body and neck, not significantly changed compared to the
prior exam. The pancreatic duct is mildly prominent, measuring 5
mm, unchanged in size. The pancreas is otherwise unremarkable.
The spleen is normal appearing. The adrenal glands are
unremarkable. Tiny hypodensities within the right kidney are too
small to characterize but are likely simple cysts. The left
kidney is unremarkable.
