[**6-23**] CXR: IMPRESSION: 1.  Right subclavian PICC line has its tip
in the distal SVC near the cavoatrial junction.  Lung volumes
are low with small bilateral layering effusions and patchy
bibasilar opacities which most likely represent compressive
atelectasis, although bilateral pneumonia or aspiration cannot
be entirely excluded.  No pneumothorax.  No evidence of
pulmonary edema.  Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are
likely within normal limits given portable technique.  Surgical
clips are seen overlying the epigastric region.  Midline
surgical skin staples are seen overlying the mid abdomen along
with at least two abdominal surgical drains

[**6-23**] RUQ U/S: IMPRESSION:   1.  No evidence of biliary
obstruction. Prominence of the free segment of the common duct
is noted, a commonly seen finding, but the common hepatic duct
is nondilated and there is no intrahepatic biliary ductal
dilation.  Distal common bile duct and pancreatic duct could not
be evaluated due to overlying bowel gas.  2.  No gallstones or
evidence of cholecystitis.


Brief Hospital Course:
57M s/p ventral hernia repair [**2114-6-21**] at OSH, COPD, numerous
previous abdominal surgeries who presents with abdominal pain,
elevated Tbili, CBD dilatation transferred from OSH for ERCP.

# Biliary obstruction: underwent ERCP on [**6-25**] for rising
bilirubin. Sphincterotomy done w/ stone and sludge extraction.
He was treated with post-procedure ciprofloxacin to continue
through [**2114-6-30**]. His diet was gradually advanced, which he
tolerated without N/V. He had formed BM. Transaminases and
bilirubin improved.  Elective cholecystectomy is recommended,
for which follow up with his surgeon at [**Location (un) **] was arranged.
No follow-up with [**Hospital1 18**] GI is required.

# post-op ileus: Pt was transferred from OSH with NG tube for
decompression, and this was removed at time of ERCP. Diet
advanced with success, passed flatus and stool.

# Ventral hernia: recently repaired on [**6-21**] at OSH, with two JP
drains still in place. Surgery consult service following.
Incisional pain was managed with oxycodone and ultimately
oxycontin was added. He continued to have 25-50cc/24h per JP
[**Last Name (LF) 19843**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] drains were kept in place. This was discussed with his
surgeon Dr [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 12395**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 75549**] at [**Location (un) **], who agreed with plan to
discharge pt home with drains in place. He will see patient in
follow up next week. VNA was arranged for [**Location (un) 19843**] care.

# Chest imaging showed bibasilar opacities. Patient did not have
clinical signs/sx of pneumonia. Picture more consistent with
atelectasis.

Chronic issues:
# COPD: outpatient on Flovent, in hospital was stable on
Ipratropium, albuterol PRN without sx or oxygen requirement.

# OSTEOPOROSIS: stable. Continued home Calcium carbonate 1.25g
PO once daily and Vit D 1000U daily. Held Alendronate 70mg PO
(once weekly)

# GERD: Continued Omeprazole 20mg PO BID

# ANEMIA: normocytic anemia. Continued home Cyanocobalamin
1000mcg PO daily

Transitional issues:
- cholecystectomy recommended
- Follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 75549**] as above
- continue cipro through [**2114-6-30**]
