[**2101-5-9**] ECHO
PRE-BYPASS:
The left atrium is normal in size. No spontaneous echo contrast
or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium/left atrial
appendage or the body of the right atrium/right atrial
appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color
Doppler. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy
with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function
(LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. There are
focal calcifications in the aortic arch. There are complex
(>4mm) atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is
not present. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is a trivial/physiologic
pericardial effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was brought to the Operating Room on [**2101-5-9**] where
the patient underwent Coronary Bypass Graft Surgery x 4 with
Left internal mammory artery -> Left anterior artery, Reverse
saphenous vein graft-> Diagonal, Posterior descending artery and
posterior lateral branch. Overall the patient tolerated the
procedure well and post-operatively was transferred to the CVICU
in stable condition for recovery and invasive monitoring. POD 1
found the patient extubated, alert and oriented and breathing
comfortably. The patient was neurologically intact and
hemodynamically stable, weaned from inotropic and vasopressor
support. Beta blocker was initiated and increased for
hypertension. The patient was gently diuresed toward the
preoperative weight.  The patient was transferred to the
telemetry floor for further recovery. Chest tubes and pacing
wires were discontinued without complication.  Oral
hyperglycemic medications were initiated with high blood sugars,
which were well controlled at the time of discharge. The patient
was evaluated by the physical therapy service for assistance
with strength and mobility. By the time of discharge on POD 4
the patient was ambulating freely, the wound was healing and
pain was controlled with oral analgesics.  The patient was
discharged home with VNA in good condition with appropriate
follow up instructions.
