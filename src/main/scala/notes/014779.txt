Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 425**]
Chief Complaint:
VF arrest

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Endotracheal intubation (now extubated)
Central venous line placement (now removed)
Femoral line placement (now removed)
Electrophysiology study with cardiac catheterization


History of Present Illness:
39M w/ pmh significant for ebstein's anomaly s/p tricuspid valve
reconstruction, right and left sided systolic congestive heart
failure, presenting with palpitations which awoke him from
sleep. The patient presented to the ED where he appeared pale
and was found to be in VT to the 230's. He began to experience
chest pain and was given amiodarone 150mg IV X1, followed by
amiodarone gtt. He became diaphoretic and was therefore given
etomidate and shocked with 200J. His rhythm then became fine
V-fib, he became unresponsive and apneic. CPR was initiated,
epinephrine given X1, CPR continued, shocked again at 360J,
returned to V-Tach @ 240, Intubated, returned to sinus rhyhthm,
aspirated vomitus. had right bronchus intubation and ETT was
pulled back in ED. Blood pressures dropped to 48/43, started on
levophed, pressure increased to 124/77.

On presentation to the CCU, the patient is intubated with
mottled skin, on levophed, neosynephrine and vasopressin, with
HR 85 and BP 125/77.

Reports-
head CT with and without contrast [**2151-3-7**]
IMPRESSION:
1. No acute intracranial pathology.
2. Encephalomalacia of the right occipital pole with associated
ex vacuo
dilatation of the right lateral ventricular occipital [**Doctor Last Name 534**]
suggestive of prior cerebral injury.
================================
Chest CTA [**2151-3-7**]
IMPRESSION:
1. Small left pneumothorax, likely related to acute left rib
fractures. Other rib deformities are bilateral.
2. Bibasilar and peribronchial opacities, could be due to
massive aspiration, associated with atelectasis.
3. Severe cardiomegaly with marked enlargement of right atrium
and right
ventricle in this patient with known Ebstein malformation and
prior sternotomy for tricuspid plasty.
4. Mediastinal lipomatosis.
5. Venous shunt between the right and the middle hepatic veins,
could be due to old Budd-Chiari disease. Tiny filling defect in
the abnormal connection could be branching vessels or thrombus,
likely old.
.
================================
[**2151-3-7**] CT chest
IMPRESSION:
1. No residual pneumothorax in the upper two-thirds of the
chest. One
residual air bubble in the mediastinum. No chest tube was
installed.
2. No other change since earlier today.
================================
CT chest [**2151-3-13**]- IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of intra-abdominal fluid collection.
2. Basal pulmonary consolidation with small pleural effusions.
3. Mediastinal lipomatosis.
4. Right adrenal myelolipoma.
5. Evidence of previous right hip AVN.
.
Echo with bubble study
No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the left
atrium/left atrial appendage or the right atrium/right atrial
appendage. The left and atrial and right appendage emptying
velocities are depressed (<0.2m/s). The intra-atrial septum is
thickened consistent with prior ASD closure surgery. No residual
atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left
ventricular wall thickness and cavity size are grossly normal.
The apex is heavily trabeculated. Systolic function could not be
adequately assessed. Th e systolic function appears depressed.
The right ventricular cavity is dilated with marked free wall
hypokinesis. There are simple atheroma in the descending
thoracic aorta to 45cm from the incisors. The descending aorta
is relatively small, but no coarctation or dissection is seen.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with
good leaflet excursion. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral
regurgitation. No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral
valve. The tricuspid annular ring is identified and appears well
seated. Mild to moderate tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There
is no pericardia
