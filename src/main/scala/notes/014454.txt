Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2745**]
Chief Complaint:
Fatigue

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 68 yo man with past history of pituitary tumor
s/p resection ([**2187**]) and remote seizure disorder, who presented
from his group home with fatigue.  He stated that a someone at
the home called the ambulance to bring him in, but he cannot
pinpoint the cause.  He thought it may have been because he did
not get out of bed the day PTA.  He denied fever and SOB at
home. He did have a chronic cough but he has smoked [**2-8**] ppd X 50
years, with likely chronic bronchitis. He denied increased
sputum production compared to his baseline.

In the ED, he  was initially normotensive and febrile to 102.9
with HR 97. He then dropped his blood pressures to the 70s
systolic. He received a total of 5 L NS with improvement in
blood pressure.  Head CT demonstrated an intracranial fluid
collection concerning for an infection.  He received
levofloxacin and ceftriaxone; he also received dexamethasone 4
mg X 1 for possible meningitis.  Urinalysis was unrevealing.
Labs were notable for Cr 1.7 (baseline 0.5 per old records) and
lactate 2.4.  He was evaluated by neurosurgery in the ED who
felt that his fatigue and presentation was likely not related to
his prior pituitary surgery.  An LP was also performed to rule
out CNS infection.

The patient denied headache, chest pain, nausea/vomiting,
abdominal pain, dysuria, and shortness of breath. He did endorse
diarrhea which started in the ED.  He had had a pruritic rash on
his back for 3 months.

1.  pituitary tumor, now panhypopit
2.  seizure disorder
3.  hypothyroidism
4.  GERD

Social History:

IMAGING:
[**2204-4-7**] CXR: No acute cardiopulmonary process
[**2204-4-9**] CXR: New left lower lobe pneumonia

[**2204-4-9**] TTE:
The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. Left
ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global
systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%) Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
present. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are structurally normal. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation
is seen. There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is an anterior space which most likely
represents a fat pad. IMPRESSION: Normal biventricular cavity
sizes with preserved global and regional biventricular systolic
function. Borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Mild mitral regurgitation with normal valve morphology. Compared
with the prior report (images unavailable for review) of
[**2201-6-4**], biventricular systolic function is similar.

[**2204-4-7**] CT Head:
Status post remote right frontal craniotomy and right frontal
sinus surgery approximately eight years prior.  High-attenuation
material seen within the right frontal sinus, measuring greater
than that would be expected for simple fluid.  Differential
diagnosis includes proteinaceous material, versus post-surgery
hematoma, although this is considered less likely given the
amount of time that has passed, versus an underlying infectious
process such as a fungal sinusitis.  New low-attenuation areas
tracking within the right frontal lobe superiorly are concerning
for empyema.  Consideration of MRI examination for further
characterization is recommended.

[**2204-4-8**] MRI Head:
1.  Prior right frontal sinus surgery with expected
postoperative changes.
2.  No evidence of hemorrhage, edema, or infectious process.


Brief Hospital Course:
PNEUMONIA:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was found to have a left lower lobe pneumonia,
likely community acquired.  He was severely volume depleted on
admission (with ARF; see below) requiring brief MICU admission
for hypotension.  Initial CXR did not show an infiltrate;
however, after volume repletion, an infiltrate was more evident
on repeat CXR two days after presentation to the ED.  It was
thought that the pneumonia was the cause of his fatigue, malaise
and headache, prompting presentation to the ED.  He was also
ruled out for influenza as well as meningitis (LP was negative).
 He was started on a ten day course of levofloxacin with
improvement in his fevers and symptoms.

ACUTE RENAL FAILURE:
Mr. [**Known lastname 109270**] creatinine was 1.7 on admission, up from his
baseline around 0.5.  This was thought to be secondary to
prerenal volume depletion in the setting of his lung infection,
and his creatinine improved significantly with IVF.  He was
discharged with Cr 0.9.
