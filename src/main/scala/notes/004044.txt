History of Present Illness:
[**Known lastname 80294**] is an 84 y/o M with history of recent CHF exacerbation
following hospitalizatin for sepsis who presents to the hospital
with increasing LE edema and dyspnea. This morning, he developed
acute shortness of breath, and was brought to the hospital by
ambulance. He denied any other symptoms such as fever, cough, or
chest pain.  In the ED, Initially, he was satting 97% on RA but
tachypneic to 30s. BPs 118/83 initially, now 111/74. He was
started on nitro gtt, and received hydralazine 5mg IV as well.
He also received a dose of vancomycin and zosyn for possible
infectious precipitant.  He is anticoagulated for a history of
DVT, and his present INR is 4.4. He also received 60mg PO K for
a potassium of 3.4. CXR showed volume overload. He then received
80mg IV lasix putting out only 500cc (home 80), put on bipap. He
was trialed off bipap and looked okay by numbers but was still
felt to be tenuous and was placed back on bipap for transfer.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for + orthopnea,
longstanding. On review of symptoms, he denies any prior history
of stroke, TIA, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of
surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools
or red stools. He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors. He
denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other review
of systems were negative.

Imaging
CXR [**2159-3-16**] FINDINGS: AP semi-upright portable chest radiograph
is obtained. There is persistent cardiomegaly with central
pulmonary vascular congestion and relative indistinctness of the
hilum. Bilateral pleural effusions are again noted with fissural
fluid noted on the right. Mediastinal contour is grossly stable
and difficult to accurately assess on this portable AP chest
radiograph. No pneumothorax is seen. Bibasilar atelectasis is
also stable. Osseous structures are unchanged.
IMPRESSION: Mild CHF with bilateral pleural effusions.

TTE [**2159-3-17**] The left atrium is moderately dilated. Left
ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular
cavity is mildly dilated. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a
focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). The
right ventricular cavity is dilated with depressed free wall
contractility. The number of aortic valve leaflets cannot be
determined. There is no aortic valve stenosis. Mild (1+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. Moderate to severe (3+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is severe pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion. If clinically
indicated, a transesophageal echocardiographic examination is
recommended to assess mitral valve morphology, exclude a
vegetation, and better evaluate severity of mitral
regurgitation.
IMPRESSION: Dilated left ventricle with normal global systolic
function. Dilated and at least mildly hypokinetic right
ventricle. Mild aortic regurgitation. Moderate to severe mitral
regurgitation. Severe pulmonary hypertension. Compared with the
prior study (images reviewed) of [**2159-2-15**], LV is more dilated.
Mitral regurgitation severity has increased, and pulmonary
pressure is more severe. Findings discussed with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 4135**] at
1410 hours on the day of the study.

[**2159-3-23**] CXR FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**3-21**], there
may be some continued improvement in the mild pulmonary edema.
Enlargement of the cardiac silhouette persists. Progressive
decrease in the pleural effusions, especially on the right. Mild
bibasilar atelectasis persists.

ECG [**2159-3-18**] The rhythm appears to be atrial fibrillation with a
moderate ventricular response and occasional ventricular ectopy.
Right bundle-branch block. Compared to the previous tracing of
[**2159-3-16**] atrial fibrillation has appeared. Clinical correlation
is suggested.
ECG [**2159-3-17**] Sinus rhythm. Left atrial abnormality. Right
bundle-branch block. Compared to the previous tracing of [**2159-3-16**]
no diagnostic interim change.
