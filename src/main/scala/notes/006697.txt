PRIMARY DIAGNOSIS:  Intraventricular hemorrhage,
status post drain

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Frontal headache and nausea

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 68-year-old man
with peripheral vascular disease, insulin dependent type II
diabetes, coronary artery disease and hypertension who was
transferred to the [**Hospital6 256**]
Neurologic Intensive Care Unit on [**5-22**] from [**Hospital3 29718**] with a right interventricular plate.  The patient woke
up three days prior to admission complaining of a severe
headache which worsened over the next two days.  The morning
of admission, the patient vomited twice.  He reports that the
headache is non throbbing, generalized and frontal in
location.  ............. called the primary care physician
and sent the patient to the Emergency Department at [**Hospital3 29718**] where he was reported to be awake, oriented and moving
all extremities normally.  His blood pressure at the time was
180/90.  His INR was 1.9.  His PTT was 42.8.  The patient was
given 2 units of fresh frozen plasma prior to transfer.  The
patient denies any weakness or numbness, any changes in
vision and changes in speech or language.  On arrival at [**Hospital3 **], the patient still was complaining of a frontal
headache, nausea and felt tired.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Insulin dependent diabetes x2

6.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, status post
coronary artery bypass graft, four vessel, in [**2133**].
7.  Left femoral bypass in '[**34**]
8.  Right common femoral AK [**Doctor Last Name **] '[**34**]

ALLERGIES:  PENICILLIN WHICH CAUSES A RASH AND ERYTHROMYCIN

PHYSICAL EXAM ON PRESENTATION TO NEUROLOGIC INTENSIVE CARE
UNIT:
VITAL SIGNS:  Blood pressure 178 to 209/76 to 103, pulse 78
to 84, respiratory rate of 18, saturating 100% on room air.
GENERAL:  The patient appeared comfortable and closes his
eyes frequently and is sleeping during the exam.
NECK:  Supple without bruit, no meningismus.
CARDIAC:  Normal S1, S2, regular rate.
LUNGS:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally.
ABDOMEN:  Soft, nontender, nondistended.
EXTREMITIES:  Status post right AKA with no edema.
NEUROLOGIC:  The patient was awake, sleeping, oriented to
self and [**Hospital3 **].  He stated that date was [**5-25**]
rather than the 18th and that the year was '[**43**].  His speech
was fluent without paraphasic errors, normal repetition,
naming.  Patient was intermittently inattentive.  The patient
was able to say the months of the year forward with one skip.
He was unable to say the months of the year backwards.  The
patient drew a clock which was poorly organized.

CRANIAL NERVE EXAM:  The patient's pupils were equal, round
and reactive to light, 1.5 to 1.  Extraocular movements were
full.  The patient was inattentive on formal testing with the
exception that the patient did have slight restriction of up
gaze bilaterally.  He was inattentive to visual field
testing, but positive blink reflex bilaterally.  Strength and
sensation intact and symmetric.  Tongue and uvula in the
midline.  Shoulder strength is strong.  Motor exam:  The
patient was without drift.  He has increased bulk in the left
lower extremity, status post right AKA, status post left
first toe amputation.  Strength was full throughout.  There
were positive fasciculations in the left calf.  Deep
tendon reflexes were depressed throughout.
The patient gets painful cramp in left calf during exam.
Left toes were equivocal.  Sensation was intact to light
touch, pain, sensation and temperature throughout.  Absent
vibration on the left toes.  The patient had a positive
action tremor on finger to nose bilaterally.  Rapid
alternating movements were intact in both upper extremities.

LABS:  Chem-7 142, 4.3, 101, 30, 39, 2.2, 77.  CBC - white
blood cell count 11.0, 14.4, platelets 149.  CK 61, troponin
negative.  PT 16.3, INR 1.9, PTT 36.6.  Head CT showed blood
on deep [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the right lateral ventricle
with small anterior secondary edema, questionable blood in
the right thalamus.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the Neurologic
Intensive Care Unit.  He was noted to be awake, but
disoriented to date.  On [**5-24**], the patient became
aggressively less responsive and a ventricular drain was
placed.  After that time, the patient was noted to have some
improvement in his mental status, but was still not oriented
to the date.  An MRI was done on [**2142-5-25**] which showed right
periventricular hemorrhage along the margin of the atrium
with the right lateral ventricle with extension to the
lateral ventricle with no definite evidence of abnormal
enhancement to indicate underlying mass.  An angiogram was
planned for [**5-28**], however the patient was noted to be more
lethargic and the study was not done.  He also had a rise in
his BUN and creatinine.  The ventricular drain was cleansed
on [**6-1**] in the morning and a repeat CT scan showed a minimal
increase in the front ends of the frontal and temporal horns
of the bilateral lateral ventricles as compared to the
previous CT on [**2142-5-28**].

On the morning of [**6-2**], the patient was still complaining of
bifrontal headache, but denied nausea or vomiting and was
transferred to neurology floor.  On the neurology floor, the
patient continued to wax and wane in attentiveness and level
of orientation.  On [**2142-6-4**], the patient had two episodes of
emesis in the morning, but had no further episodes and his
nausea and headache returned to their baseline levels.  The
patient was noted over the course of his stay to have a
consistently low sodium with its nadir being 127 and on
[**2142-6-5**] he had a second nadir of 132.

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS will be added at a later date, as well
as condition on discharge.
