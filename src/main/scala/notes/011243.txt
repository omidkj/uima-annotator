Syncope/Chordae Tendinae Rupture of Mitral Valve

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 5874**] is a 45 y/o male with a history of syncopal
episodes and holosystolic murmur who was admitted to the CCU
after a 9 second asystolic pause in the emergency department.

The patient has a history of recurrent sinusitis and presented
on the morning of [**2109-8-21**] to the hospital in [**Location (un) 620**] for
scheduled ENT surgery. While urinating pre-procedure, he became
light-headed and syncopized. An echo was done to work up his
syncopal episode which showed severe (4+) mitral regurgitation
and evidence of posterior chordae tendinae rupture. His
procedure was deferred and he was referred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further
cardiac evaluation. Of note, his primary care physician stated
in his note last [**Month (only) 205**] that he heard a new, loud, systolic murmur
in the mitral area. The patient was referred for an echo at that
time, but there is no note in the system and his family cannot
recall him having this study done. They do state that if he had
had the echo done, it would have been here. Over the past few
months, he has had armchair orthopnea and has been waking up
several times per week short of breath and experiencing malaise
(per wife, [**Name (NI) **] notes). PCP note from [**2109-7-30**] also states chest
pain and this symptom complex was attributed to bronchospasm [**3-7**]
post-nasal drip.

On arrival to the emergency department, the patient's vitals
were 98.3 98 125/80 16 99% 4L. He reportedly desatted without
O2. His EKG was NSR with a right axis deviation and signs of
RVH. When his blood was drawn for routine labs, the patient
became nauseated and again syncopized, his heart rate
subsequently decreasing into the 40s and then leading to 9
seconds of asystole, during which is SBP dipped into the 80s.
Chest compressions were undertaken for 30 seconds and there was
ROSC, after which he was electively intubated and sedated. A
STAT echo revealed severe MR, flail posterior leaflet/chordae,
LAE, severe pulmonary HTN, mild pericardial effusion, RV
hypokinesis, and an LVEF of 75-80%. A chest X-ray showed marked
cardiomegaly and congested pulmonary vasculature. Cardiac
surgery was consulted and felt that he needed an urgent (but not
emergent) mitral valve replacement as this was likely a chronic
problem.

The patient was taken to the cath lab and received right and
left heart catheterization. Left heart cath revealed clean
coronaries. Right heart cath showed RA 20's, RV 70's, LVEDP
20's, PA SBP: 30's. Wedge could not be obtained at the time. His
cardiac index was 1.7 and an intra-aortic balloon pump was
subsequently placed for cardiogenic shock. The patient was given
40 IV Lasix, to which he diuresed approximately 400-600 cc/hour.


The patient was transferred to the CCU where his vitals were
37.4 74 (SR) 105/49 96% on PSV 5/5 at 13/minute. His ABG at that
time was 7.33/53/73/29/92%. His ventilator settings were changed
to AC TV 500ml, PEEP 5 at 22 breaths/minute to correct for his
hypercarbia, which was felt to be related to low tidal volumes
and frequency and for his hypoxemia, thought to be related to
V/Q mismatch/shunt (pulmonary congestion) and alveolar
hypoventilation (low TV) given the elevated A-a gradient (217;
nl for age = 15.3). His repeat ABG on the new settings was
7.39/47/86/30, the mild improvement in O2 suggesting shunt
physiology and his PEEP was increased from 5 to 8. He held his
blood pressure well and his first cardiac index in the unit had
increased to 2.6 with an SVR of 829.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS
Unable to obtain given intubation, but patient's wife states
that recently he has reported waking up several times a week
short of breath over the past few months and general malaise
over the same time period. She reports that his exercise
tolerance has been stable. This is corroborated by a recent PCP
note on [**2109-7-30**]

Brief Hospital Course:
45 yo M presented worsening shortness of breath over the past
several months and was at [**Location (un) 620**] [**Hospital1 18**] preparing for sinus
surgery and had a syncopal event,coded briefly. Transferred to
[**Hospital1 18**].  Patient was found to have severe mitral regurgitation
with a flailed valve leaflet. In the ER he vasovagaled after
blood was drawn and had 9 second asystole. He was intubated and
had a swan placed and was found to have a low CI (1.7). Patient
had aortic balloon pump placed because of low cardiac output and
impaired forward flow.  Balloon pump (1:1) to which he responded
well; post-IABP CI was 2.6. We felt his mitral regurg was likely
chronic given the progression of his EKG changes since [**2105**]
(increasing RVH, new RAD), his elevated PA pressures without
florid pulmonary edema, and the gradual worsening of his
symptoms, which were previously attributed to sinusitis alone.
Echo showed myxomatous mitral valve. While he was here we gave
him lasix to diurese him. He had a temp max of 100.6 which w
