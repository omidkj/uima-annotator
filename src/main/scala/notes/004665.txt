Attending:[**Doctor First Name 2080**]
Chief Complaint:
Requiring insulin gtt

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 41 year old female with asthma (poorly
controlled, recently started Xolair), DM2, HTN, vertigo,
depression, CVA [**2142**] with residual L hemiplegia who was admitted
[**1-17**] with chest pain and SOB, worsening peak flows (150 from
300) felt to be [**12-29**] to asthma exacerbation. In the ED she was
tachycardic but 02 sats 99% on 2L, wheezing on exam.  She
received 125 IV solumedrol as well as nebs. She did not receive
insulin for breakfast or lunch while in the ED, her serum
glucose at 7am was 92.
.
On arrival to the medicine floor, BG >500 at 16:30. Got 26U of
regular insulin (patient reported she was on 26 units of insulin
with [**Last Name (LF) 16429**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] she received regular insulin at this dose.
However, it was later realized that she is on concentrated
insulin --U-500 Insulin--so she was effectively underdosed.
Rechecked at 17:10 BG 466  and 473 at 18:40. Repeated lytes (as
below) and there was no gap. IVF were started and and [**Last Name (un) **] C/S
obtained. Administered additional 30U of humalog at 20:30. BG
460 at 21:00. BG 466 at 22:30. [**Last Name (un) **] C/S recommending MICU
transfer for insulin gtt.
.
On arrival to the ICU, the patient reports her breathing is bad
but has been improved with nebs, her FSG is >500.
.
ROS: + as per HPI. Additionally, notes fatigue, dizziness, sinus
pain, N/V, constipation and urinary retention x2d.
.
Denies: F/C/night sweats, HA, productive cough, palpitations,
abd pain, dysuria, myalgias, arthralgias

aunts and sister. Mother with h/o low BP and DVT. Maternal aunt

with same "mitral" problem.

Physical Exam:
VS:  HR:114 BP: 118/53 92% on RA
GENERAL -
HEENT - NC/AT, PERRLA, EOMI, sclerae anicteric, MMM, OP without
erythema or exudate
NECK - supple, trachea midline, no JVD, no thyromegaly, no LAD
LUNGS - Audible breathing with prolonged expiratory phase. R
lung with expiratory wheezes and in all fields. Unable to assess
L lung because pt will not sit forward and will only turn onto L
side. HEART - RRR, normal S1 and S2, no m/r/g. CP with radiation
reproducible with palpation.
ABDOMEN - Obese abd. normal BS, S/NT/NT, no rebound or guarding,
no organomegaly.
EXTREMITIES - MAE. WWP. PTs and radials 2+ b/l. No c/c/e.
SKIN - no rashes or lesions
NEURO - alert, oriented x3, attentive. Difficult to assess
strengnth as clear give way weakness on R side and lack of
effort on L. Sensation grossly intact throughout.

Pertinent Results:
CXR [**1-17**]: IMPRESSION: Low lung volumes with mild bibasilar
atelectasis. No focal consolidation seen.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 41 year old female with asthma, DM2, HTN,
vertigo, depression, CVA, admitted for shortness of breath and
chest pain [**12-29**] asthma exacerbation who developed hyperglycemia
in the setting of missing her insulin while in the ED, receiving
steroids and her insulin underdosed on the floor, transferred to
the MICU for insulin gtt.

# Hyperglycemia: Likely secondary to steroids and
missed/underdosing of insulin upon admission. Of note, patient's
unmanaged OSA was felt likely a contributor to her insulin
resistance (hyperadrenergic from episodic apnea). Patient did
not have a gap throughout this and her electrolytes were
regularly checked. Patient was initially on an insulin gtt with
close monitoring also by [**Last Name (un) **]. Patient was initially NPO in
the ICU on maintainance fluids (normal saline) with plan to
either resume diet when blood sugars <250 or transition to
D51/2. Given the possibility of confusing U:500 with U:100 on
the floor, patient's insulin doses were converted to U:100. Plan
was for patient to be given lantus 180 units and the insulin gtt
stopped four hours later with initiation of a tight sliding
scale. Patient's blood sugars remained persistently high,
however, so her insulin gtt was continued, [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) **] recs, at
high doses (60-70 units per hour). There was concern on the
second day in the MICU that patient's brother was bringing her
fast foods inconsistent with the hospital diabetic diet,
resulting in volatile blood sugars up to 450+. Ultimately,
patient was transferred to the floor on NPH 180 in the morning
and 20 units before bed and tight humalog sliding scale. [**Last Name (un) **]
continued to folllow patient closely on the floor. She was
discharged home after completion of pulse-dose steroids on her
home insulin regimen.

# Shortness of Breath/COPD exacerbation: Likely multifactorial,
consistent with previous asthma exacerbations (wheezing,
decreased peak flow, improvement with nebs and steroids) and
patient with notable restrictive component to her SBO due to
obesity and deconditioning.  [**Month (only) 116**] also have evolving pulm htn
from OSA and not wearing bipap at home. No signs of PNA (CXR
unchanged, no cough, fever, white count). CHF unlikely (NL echo
[**2149**], no edema or JVD, no CXR evidence). PE remained a
possibility given her tachycardia (although baseline HR90-100s
per OMR), immobilization and recent initiation of Xolair. D
dimer checked and was 557, which is similar or less than three
prior hospitalizations in the past 15 months with similar
presentations. Each time, D-Dimer obtained, D-Dimer was mildly
positive, and pt was ruled out for PE by negative V/Q scan,
treated for Asthma exacerbation and improved. Given this hx, PE
was felt unlikely and VQ scan was not pursued. Patient was
continued on Prednisone 60mg daily for presumed asthma
exacerbation, albuterol/ipratropium nebulizers, home
anti-leukotriene and Advair. Patient was continued on her home
CPAP which she is not compliant with at home but was compliant
with in-house. Patient also received one dose Magnesium for
management of her asthma as she remained persistently wheezy
until day of transfer out of MICU. Given the extreme elevations
in her blood sugar and the fact that patient's symptoms had
completely resolved by the time of transfer to the floor, a
5-day pulse dose course of steroids at 60 mg daily was felt
preferable to taper. The patient was kept in-house until
completion of the pulse course, and then discharged home on her
usual insulin regimen.

# Chest Pain: Reproducible with palpation so felt likely
MSK/non-cardiac chest pain. Unlikely ACS as no EKG changes, CE
negative x 2. GI related pain also possible, but unlikely reflux
given pt on Omeprazole and Ranitidine at home. Cardiac enzymes
negative X2 for myocardial ischemic/infarction. Patient's chest
pain was managed with Morphine initially and did not require
further pain medications for chest
