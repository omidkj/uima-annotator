Chief Complaint:
Increased respiratory secretions and inability to swallow meds.

History of Present Illness:
80 y.o. man with P.D., s/p 2 admissions over last month for
falls.  Pt was just discharged to rehab yesterday, but is now
returning with inability to take PO meds, requiring frequent
suctioning.  When pt was here last he was admitted after a
witness fall and injured his left elbow. On that admit, he was
witness to aspirate with meds, food, and liquids but family was
refusing NGT or PEG tube.  Therefore, pt was discharged with
rehab with understanding that he could take food and meds but
was at high risk of aspiration and ensuing complications.  This
morning at [**Hospital 599**] rehab in [**Location (un) **], pt was noted to have
increased resp secretion requiring q30min suctioning.  He also
could not swallow his medications.
Though pt did pass swallow study at [**Hospital1 5595**] about 2 weeks ago, he
was clearly witnessed to aspirate over last 2 days while here.
..
Currently, pt denies pain, SOB, CP, cough.  He understands why
he is here.

Brief Hospital Course:
80 y.o. man with Parkinson disease, h/o recent aspiration
presenting with increasing resp secretions and now worsening
dysphagia.
.
# MRSA aspiration pna:
Patient developed respiratory failure in the MICU from MRSA
aspiration pna.  He was maintained on Levo, Vanco, and Flagyl.
He initially was afebrile, with normal WBC and clear CXR.
Inability to swallow and take his PD regimen is the likely
reason that his dysphagia worsened.  Over the hospital stay, the
patient developed aspiration pna.  PD sublingual meds were
attempted, but were not successful.  Patient had an NGT placed
for administration of his meds, but placement attempts failed
because of anatomical variant in his pharynx.  Pulmonary and GI
both attempted to place the NGT without success.
.
Patient was frequently suctioned, underwent chest PT, and had
nebs.  Oxygen saturation were in the high 90s on nc until the
last two days before passing.  The patient's son was called to
patient's bedside for desaturation to 80s for the first time,
and code status was changed from full to DNR/DNI, consitent with
the patient's previously expressed wishes.  With the focus of
care on patient [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] infusion of morphine was used to
provide relief of pain and airhunger.  The patient passed away
in the MICU, with the patient's son by his bedside.  [**Name (NI) **]
son [**Name (NI) 382**] did not wish to have an autopsy.
.
# C diff diarrhea:
Patient was being treated for C diff with IV flagyl.
.
# AFIB with RVR:
Patient was rate controlled on digoxin, and was anticoagulated
