Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1145**]
Chief Complaint:
Transfer from [**Hospital3 **] for respiratory distress,
elevated troponins and pneumonia.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac cath s/p 2 bare metal stents to SVG-OM

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 27671**] is a 60 year-old patient of Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 11493**] with a
long history of CAD s/p 2-vessel CABG in [**2100**] (SVG to LAD and
SVG to OM), s/p PTCA to RCA and multiple PTCAs and brachytherapy
of the SVG to OM (last in [**2121-1-29**]), who was admitted to
[**Location (un) **] with cough and wheezing, as well as anginal symptoms on
[**2123-3-8**]. She describes a sore throat with "gland swelling" for
2-3 days PTA, anorexia, as well as a productive cough and
wheezing on the day prior to presentation. She also had several
anginal episodes in the day prior to admission, some at rest,
relieved with NTG SL.

She presented to the OSH on [**2123-3-8**], and was found to have a
temperature of 101.4 in the ED, WBC 13.1, 18% bands, and CXR
revealed a LLL infiltrate on CXR. Given her history of chest
pain, cardiac enzymes were also sent. She was started on
Ceftriaxone and Azithromycin for LLL pneumonia. While in
hospital, her cardiac enzymes rose with peak CK-MB 41.6,
Troponin I 13.02, and EKG revealed ST depressions in
anterolateral leads. On [**2123-3-9**], she also developed what seems
to be acute respiratory distress in the setting of elevated
blood pressure with SBP 150-200, and desaturation to 60s on 2L
via NC. ABG 7.25/69/103. She was placed on BiPAP 13/6-->15/6,
and was given Lasix 80 mg IV X 2 with 1 liter diuresis. She was
also started on Heparin gtt, Aggrestat gtt (D/C'd because of
nose bleeding)  and NTG gtt, and received Labetalol 5 mg IV X 4.
She was transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] for consideration for further
management.

Of note, by the patient account, she recently had an echo and
had her Nitro patch increased to 0/8 mg/24 hours over 24 hours
because of accelerating anginal symptoms.

Past Medical History:
1. Coronary artery disease, s/p CABG in [**2100**] with SVG to the LAD
and an SVG to the OM. S/p RCA stenting in [**2114**], s/p stenting of
SVG to OM in [**2117**], s/p PTCA of focal instent restenosis at the
ostium of SVG to the OM, s/p PTCA and gammatherapy of SVG to OM
in 01/[**2121**]. Last cath in [**7-/2122**]: SVG to the LAD had mild
diffuse disease up to 30%, patent SVG to OM with 40-50% stenosis
in the mid distal graft section not hemodynamically significant
to the obtuse marginal and the previously placed stent was
widely patent. Concern over possible ostial RCA lesion, but
could not be engaged.
2. Peripheral vascular disease
3. CHF, EF unknown. Had echo in past month at OSH.
4. Status post bilateral carotid stenting [**10/2117**]
5. COPD/Asthma, no prior intubation, no home O2.
6. Depression
7. GERD
8. Irritable bowel syndrome
9. Osteoarthritis
10. Kidney stones
11. Obesity

NOTE: She has had a 70 point difference in blood pressure in
both arms in the past.

Past surgical history:
1. Status post cholecystectomy
2. Status post hysterectomy
3. Status post tonsillectomy
4. Status post umbilical hernia repair
5. Basal cell carcinoma removed from face

Social History:
She lives alone. She has a housekeeper who comes in once a week
to help with her laundry. Ex-smoker, she quit 23 years ago. She
denies EtOH use.

Family History:
Non-contributory

Pertinent Results:
Laboratory data from the OSH on admission:
CBC: WBC 13.1 with 18% bands, 66% neutrophils. Hct 40.6, Plt
137.

Chemistry:
Na 144, K 4.6, Cl 102, HCO3 27, BUN 21.6, Creat 1.3 (was 1.1 in
[**3-/2122**]), Glucose 1.3. Normal LFTs.

Cardiac enzymes:
CK 404-->576
CKMB 29.9-->41.6
MB index 7.4-->7.2
Trop 0.06-->13.02-->7.42

Microbiology data:
[**2123-3-8**] Blood cultures pending

CXR: LLL infiltrate

EKG [**2123-3-9**]: NSR, rate 110, normal intervals, normal axis. ST
elevation in aVR (and V1, V2 on different EKGs), 1-[**Street Address(2) 1766**]
depressions in I, II, aVF, V3-6. No T wave inversion. Qs in III.


EKG on arrival to CCU [**Hospital1 18**]: NSR, rate 77 bpm. Less than 1mm ST
elevation in V1,V2. ST depression I, II, aVL, V5.

Cath:
1. Selective graft angiography revealed a SVG->OM with a 60%
lesion in
the distal segment followed by a 70% lesion in the distal
anastomosis
into the native OM.
2. Hemodynamic evaluation revealed normal right and left heart
filling
pressures. There was no evidence of significant pulmonary HTN.
3. Successful PTCA/stenting of the SVG->OM graft with a 3.0x18mm
Driver
stent in the anastomosis postdilated to 3.5 in the proximal
segment and
with a 3.5x18mm Driver stent in the distal segment overlapping
the
previously placed Cypher DES as well as the new Driver stent in
the
anastomosis. Final angiography revealed 10% residual stenosis in
the
distal SVG, no dissection and TIMI-3 flow (see PTCA comments).

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. One vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Normal right and left heart filling pressures.
3. PCI of the SVG->OM.

Echo:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. There is left ventricular
hypertrophy.  The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Due to
suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality
cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic
function iis probably preserved but views are technically
suboptimal for assessment of global and regional wall motion.
Right ventricular chamber size is normal. Right ventricular
systolic function is probably normal. The aortic valve leaflets
are moderately thickened. There is mild aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.  The
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no
pericardial effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 27671**] is a 61 year-old female with long-standing
history of CAD status post 2-vessel CABG in [**2100**], s/p multiple
stents and interventions to SVG to OM graft, admitted with LLL
pneumonia, CHF and NSTEMI.

1) NSTEMI: Ruled in at OSH with elevated CK-MB, troponin I. Cath
was attempted after pt diuresed, however cath was aborted d/t pt
discomfort and desaturation on table.  She likely became
anxious, which caused tachycardia, demand-mediated ischemia, and
then flash pulmonary edema.  She quickly recovered. Cath showed
30-40% SVG-LAD-D, and 80% OM distal to SVG. She was subsequently
re-cathed and two bare metal stents were placed to her SVG-OM.
Pt now on ASA, plavix, BB, lipitor, Imdur, hydralazine, CCB.  Of
note, pt gets ARF on ACE inhibitors.

2) Refractory HTN: Pt's outpt hydralazine was doubled with
better control of h
