none


History of Present Illness:
83M with hx of COPD, afib who was sent to the ER from [**Doctor Last Name **] House
after he was found to be tachypneic to the 40s. Per nurse [**First Name (Titles) 767**] [**Name (NI) 63570**] House, pt normally keeps to himself and is generally
healthy except for his breathing. She states that his physician
has been trying to get him to wear O2 but he has refused. Pt
states that over the past two weeks, he has been having loose
stools and crampy, squeezing abdominal pain. He has been eating
normal meals but his pain worsens after eating. He describes
some nausea but has not had any emesis. Pt states his breathing
has felt fine until the last day when it started to feel
labored, associated with productive cough.
.
In the [**Name (NI) **], pt found to be hypotensive to 50s/30s with HR in the
40s, RR in the 40s, 100% on NRB. Of note, he had taken his 200mg
of toprol XL in the am. He was given Glucagon 1mg IV x 1 with no
improvement in HR. He was then started on Dopamine which
improved both HR and BP. This was titrated up to 25mcg to
maintain MAPs in the 60s. He was then given ceftriaxone and
vancomycin to cover for PNA. He was given solumedrol, albuterol
and atrovent nebs to cover for COPD flare. And he was given 10mg
of Lasix for possible CHF but also had received 2L of NS
earlier. He was then admitted to the ICU.

CXR: Heart size is at upper limits of normal. The aorta is
calcified and tortuous. Pulmonary vasculature is unremarkable.
There is a left lower lobe opacity and small left pleural
effusion. Left lower lobe opacity could represent atelectasis;
however, pneumonia cannot be excluded.
.
ECHO: The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity size, and systolic function are normal
(LVEF>55%). Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal.
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. There is no
mitral valve prolapse. Mild to moderate ([**2-4**]+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
.
RUQ U/S:
1. Patent hepatic vasculature.
2. Unremarkable liver echotexture.
3. Trace ascites.
4. Simple-appearing cyst of the mid left kidney.
.


Brief Hospital Course:
83M with hx of COPD, afib now in ICU for hypotension found to
have abdominal pain and elevated LFTs
.
# Shock: Volume depletion vs sepsis vs adrenal insufficiency or
combination. Volume depletion likely due to 2 weeks of loose
stools and decreased po intake. Sepsis also likely given lactate
of 4.8, possible pneumonia and possible intra-abd source.
Adrenal insufficiency was impossible to test given that pt
received solumedrol in ED. Cardiogenic shock not likely given
lack of EKG changes and negatige enzymes and TTE showed
preserved systolic function.  Patient was given fluids and
started on dopamine to maintain MAPs>60.  Steroids were changed
to decadron to perform [**Last Name (un) 104**] stim test but initial level was 40
so stim was not performed.  Steroids were d/c'd.  Pt was weaned
off dopamine on hospital day #2 and BPs remained stable. BB was
resumed for rate control and verapamil was restarted.  SBPs
remained 120s-140s.
.
# Sepsis: Possible sources include lung, urine, abdomen. CXR
with possible infiltrate so started levaquin/flagyl. UA was
clean and urine culture was negative. blood cultures remain
negative. Pt remained afebrile with elevated WBC count,
attributed to possible PNA and steroids.  His WBC should be
followed in rehab to make sure it is trending down.
.
# Transaminitis: ALT and AST equally elevated to the [**2193**] on
admission. Ddx of this includes right heart failure (which may
explain elevated BNP), shock liver, viral hepatitis (which could
explain pt's abd pain, nausea, diarrhea), med related (he is on
650mg standing tylenol TID), budd chiari. No hx of etoh abuse.
RUQ US was normal without evidence of clot and tylenol level was
neg.  PAtient's HepAV Ab was positive, [**Last Name (un) **] IgM is pending.  We
will continue to hold his statin and she should not be on
standing tylenol.  His LFTs should also be trended to make sure
they are trending down.
.
# Abd Pain/diarrhea: Stool was sent for E. coli 0157 given h/o
diarrhea and ARF.  C diff also sent.  Patient's diarrhea
resolved as did his abdominal pain.  As above, his abd U/S was
negative.  It may be secondary to hepatitis A but IgM was
pending on time of discharge.
.
# Tachypnea/COPD: Likely that pt has an underlying pneumonia
causing an exacerbation of his underlying COPD.  He was given
standing nebs along with oxygen.  His breathing improved
dramatically over the first few hours of his hospital stay.  He
should continue on albuterol and atrovent inhalers.  He also
should continue to wear oxygen at rest and with ambulation.  He
was started on advair.  He may benefit from an outpatient
pulmonary appointment along with PFTs.  He may also need
additional medications including tiotropium.
.
# CHF: By report only.  Echo was normal with preserved funciton.
 BNP elevated to 18,000 on admission but appeared dry on exam so
he improved with fluids. He was continued on his beta blocker
after BP normalized.
.
# Afib: Patient was in NSR on admission and converted to a-fib
while in MICU with HR 100's-120's. He is not anticoagulated
likely due to fall risk.  He is rate controlled with beta
blocker and verapamil.
.
# ARF: Baseline is unknown.  Urine lytes showed FeNa of 0.9%
indicating pre-rernal etiology verses acute tubular necrosis
from hypotension.  Creatinine peaked at 2.8 from 1.9 on
admission and is now trending down.  This should be followed and
medications adjusted for creatinine clearance.
.
# Glucse Intolerance: Pt was covered with insulin sliding scale
but required none.
.
# Code: Pt is DNR/DNI, confirmed with PCP
.
