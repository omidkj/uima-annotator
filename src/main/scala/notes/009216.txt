Brief Hospital Course:
#) FEVER: Blood cultures from [**5-30**] grew out 4/4 bottles
Serratia, pan sensitive.  DDx considered for fever included
infectious gastroenteritis, pneumonia, or line infection.
Initially he was placed on Vanco/Levo/Flagyl for broad spectrum
abx coverage, but this was decreased to Levofloxacin monotherapy
after sensitivities returned. The PICC line was d/c'd on [**5-31**]
and a temporary central line was placed. A TTE was negative for
vegetations. Given concern for seeding of his lines and pacer
leads, an ID consult was obtained to assess the need for TEE to
more definitively rule out endocarditis and course of Abx
treatment. Because of his rapid response to therapy and
insufficient evidence to definitively suggest a line infection,
a two-week course of antibiotics was recommended and the
pacemaker was not removed. His last two sets of blood cultures
on [**6-1**] were still negative for growth on the day of discharge.
.
#) HYPOTENSION:  The patient had SBPs in the 80's with low UOP
in the ER. This was most likely due to distributive shock given
GNRs in blood.  UOP and BP improved w/ NS.  Lactate was 2.5 on
admission and improved to 1.4 within 24 hours. His sepsis was
treated as above.
.
#) CV:
--> PUMP: The patient has severe CHF on chronic milrinone drip
at home which was continued at the prior dose. Bumex and coreg
were held, and lisinopril and digoxin were continued. His home
medications were resumed on discharge.
--> CAD: The pt has a h/o CAD s/p CABG; he had no signs of
ischemia on admission. ASA/plavix/statin were continued
--> RHYTHM: has BiV/ICD; paced
.
#) ACUTE ON CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE:  The patient had ARF on
admission to ER w/ Cr=2.0.  This was likely prerenal as it
improved w/ IVF, and he was discharged with a baseline Cr of
1.5.
.
#) DM2: Prandin was held until the pt was taking PO's; it was
restarted on [**6-1**]. He was maintained on a RISS.
