Chief Complaint:
Chest and back pain/Hypotension

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**Date range (1) 86880**] - Repair of acute type A aortic dissection with
28-mm Dacron interposition graft from the sinotubular junction
to the beginning portion of the aortic arch using deep
hypothermic circulatory arrest.


History of Present Illness:
 y/o male presented to outside hospital with 10/10 epigastric
pain.  Subsequently developed right lower extremity pain
followed
by right lower extremity numbness.  Emergency CT scan showed
dissection of ascending aorta with ? involvement of aortic root
extending to both iliacs.  Patient emergently transferred to
[**Hospital1 18**] OR.  Patient with 10/10 epigastric pain in OR.  TEE showed
+2 aortic regurgitation.  In the OR, no pulses felt in right
lower extremity.  +3 pulses in left femoral/DP/PT.  Underwent
emergency repair of ascending aortic dissection.


Past Medical History:
Hypertension
Tobacco use

Social History:
Works as a physician. [**Name10 (NameIs) 13802**] with wife. [**Name (NI) **] is an active smoker.

Family History:
N/C

Physical Exam:
Intubated on OR table, unable to fully examine
Right foot mildly cool but pink.  No palpable pedal pulses right
(examined from under drape)

Pulse Exam (P=Palpation, D=Dopplerable, N=None)
RLE Femoral: faintly palpable prior to going on bypass.
LLE Femoral: P.


Pertinent Results:
[**2159-4-28**] ECHO
PRE-BYPASS:
The left atrium is dilated. No spontaneous echo contrast or
thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium/left atrial
appendage or the body of the right atrium/right atrial
appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color
Doppler.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal
cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).

Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.

A mobile density is seen in the ascending aorta consistent with
an intimal flap/aortic dissection. A mobile density is seen in
the aortic arch consistent with an intimal flap/aortic
dissection. A mobile density is seen in the descending aorta
consistent with an intimal flap/aortic dissection. There is no
pericardial effusion.

The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. Moderate (2+) aortic regurgitation is
seen.

The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no
mitral valve prolapse. No mitral regurgitation is seen. There is
no pericardial effusion. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 914**] was notified in person of
the results on [**Known lastname 27735**] before surgical incision.

Post_Bypass:

There is no aortic insufficiency.
Thoracic aorta is intact.
Minimal MR, TR.
Biventricular systolic functioni s good. LVEF 55%.

Impression:
Right ICA with no stenosis .
Left ICA with no stenosis .

RCCA true lumen appears re-expanded with complete collapse of
flase lumen comared to pre-op CTA from outside hospital.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 27735**] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2159-4-28**] for emergency
repair of his type A aortic dissection. He as taken immediately
to the operating room where he underwent repair of acute type A
aortic dissection with 28-mm Dacron interposition graft from the
sinotubular junction to the beginning portion of the aortic arch
using deep
hypothermic circulatory arrest. A vascular surgery consult was
obtained intraoperatively as he had diminished pulses in his
right lower extremity however following his operation, his
pulses improved to normal. Postoperatively he was taken to the
intensive care unit for monitoring. On postoperative day one, he
self extubated himself requiring reintubation. He was noted to
be quite agitated and somewhat confused. On postoperative day
four, he was successfully extubated and was neurologically
intact. He was later transferred to the step down unit for
further recovery. He developed atrial fibrillation which
converted with amiodarone and beta blockade. Amiodarone was
increased to three times a day on post operative day 7 for
increased premature atrial beats. He is to be discharged on an
amiodarone taper and is to receive no anticoagulation per Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 914**].  He worked with physical therapy daily. Gentle diuresis
was initiated.

He continued to make steady progress and was discharged home on
postoperative day 7. He will follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 914**] and his
primary care physician and cardiologist  as an outpatient.
