Admission Date:  [**2178-11-28**]       Discharge Date:


Service:  Trauma Service

ADMITTING DIAGNOSIS:  Motor vehicle accident.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 71-year-old female who
was in a motor vehicle accident, car vs tree.  She was
unrestrained driver.  She had positive loss of consciousness
at the scene.  She was complaining of left arm pain, sternal
and left upper quadrant pain.  She was transferred to an
outside hospital where her blood pressure was found to be
80/30 and was noted to have increasing abdominal pain with
distention.  She had a CT scan that showed a splenic
laceration with free fluid around the liver and spleen.  Her
head CT demonstrated multiple facial fractures.  She had a
left proximal humerus fracture and distal radial fracture.
She has a history of aortic valve replacement, mechanical
valve on Coumadin with an initial INR of 3.9 and hematocrit
of 29.  At this point she was Med Flighted to the [**Hospital1 346**] for further treatment.  She had
received two units of packed red blood cells, 2 liters of
intravenous fluids, Vitamin K, FFP on transfer.  She had a
fast exam that was positive for free fluid.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  As above and also includes non-insulin
dependent diabetes mellitus, total abdominal hysterectomy and
hypertension.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS:  On admission included the following:  Coumadin,
Digoxin, Furosemide, Vasotec, Atenolol, Hytrin, Diazepam,
Glyburide and Zocor.  The doses are as follows:  Digoxin 0.25
mg po q d, Lasix 80 mg po q d, Vasotec 20 mg po bid, Atenolol
50 mg po q d, Hytrin 2 mg po q d, Coumadin as directed,
Diazepam 5 mg q h.s., Glyburide 2.5 mg po q d and Zocor 10 mg
po q d.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  In the Emergency Room, she had a blood
pressure of 97/41, heart rate 75, respiratory rate 20,
satting 99%.  She was on a board with collar.  She had right
periorbital ecchymosis and edema.  Her pupils were 3 mm and
fixed on the right.  Extraocular movements intact were
intact.  Her mid face was stable.  Her trachea was midline.
Her cardiac exam was regular rate and rhythm.  Her lungs were
clear to auscultation bilaterally.  Her abdomen was firmly
distended and tender diffusely.  She had left upper quadrant
guarding.  Her rectal exam was normal tone, heme negative.
Extremities demonstrated a tender left arm that was splinted.
Her back had no deformities.  Neurologically she had [**Initials (NamePattern4) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 2611**] coma scale of 15.

LABORATORY DATA:  Laboratory values were sent and she had a
white count of 10, hematocrit 19.6, platelet count 155,000.
Her coagulation studies were PT of 19.5, INR 2.6, PTT 36,
fibrinogen was 183.  She had a normal chest x-ray.  Her C
spine was negative to T7.  Her pelvis was within normal
limits on CT.  Her head CT showed a right orbital fracture,
right maxillary fracture, nasal fracture.  At this time it
was felt that this was a [**Age over 90 **]-year-old female with mechanical
AVR, coumadinized with an elevated INR who had sustained a
splenic injury with hemoperitoneum secondary to motor vehicle
accident with multiple facial fractures as well as other
orthopedic fractures, who was hypotensive, hemodynamically
unstable, necessitating immediate operative intervention.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  On [**2178-11-28**] at 8:30 p.m. she was taken to
the operating room where an exploratory laparotomy and
splenectomy were performed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], assisted by Drs.
[**Last Name (STitle) 16059**], [**Name5 (PTitle) **] and [**Name5 (PTitle) 4427**].  She had gross blood in the
abdomen with a splenic laceration.  Her spleen had to be
removed.  She received three units of packed red blood cells,
3300 cc of crystalloid and 200 of cell [**Doctor Last Name 10105**].  Estimated
blood loss was 1200 cc.  She also had an orthopedic consult
which felt that she had a closed left surgical neck fracture
and a closed left distal radius fracture.  She was placed in
a Charnley splint for the distal radius fracture and the left
surgical neck fracture was initially managed conservatively.
She had an oral maxillofacial surgery consult for her
multiple lacerations as well as her nasal fracture.  Oral
maxillofacial surgery requested orbital reconstructions of
her CT scan to better evaluate the visceral cranium.  She was
started on antibiotics for staph coverage and her nose was
packed to control epistaxis.  She was started on Clindamycin
and Kefzol.  She was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit
for further management and ophthalmology consult was also
obtained in the Intensive Care Unit.  Re-evaluation of her CT
scans were read as a left medial and lateral wall fracture,
left floor fracture with no evidence of ocular muscle
entrapment.  She had ecchymosis of the left thigh.  While in
the Intensive Care Unit she was reevaluated by oral
maxillofacial surgery for her facial fractures and it was
also noted that she had a comminuted right maxillary fracture
involving the sinus.  The [**Known firstname **] was evaluated by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 23170**]
and her facial fractures were treated conservatively with
nasal packing.  She remained in the Intensive Care Unit for
three days and by postoperative day #4 she was transferred to
the floor.  While in the Intensive Care Unit she also
underwent a reduction of her left proximal humerus fracture
which was managed in a closed fashion conservatively with
splinting.  She was transferred to the floor on postoperative
day #4.  At this time she was on a Heparin drip for
anticoagulation given the fact that she had a mechanical AVR.
Her diet was advanced.  Her intravenous fluids were hep
locked.  She was changed to oral pain medication, she was
begun on Coumadin and her Foley was discontinued.  At this
time the [**Known firstname **] looked very well.  She had remained
afebrile, had adequate urine output, her midline laparotomy
incision was well healed.  She did choose not to have her
facial fractures repaired by oral maxillofacial surgery and
was making an adequate recovery until it was noted on
postoperative day #5 that her hematocrit had dropped to 20.8.
She was transfused two units of blood for this.  It was felt
that this was likely secondary hemolysis from cell [**Doctor Last Name 10105**]
blood.  She, on postoperative day #6 was noted to be
confused, disoriented.  She had a chest x-ray taken at that
point which demonstrated a new left lower lobe consolidation
and she was also noted to be in urinary retention.  A Foley
catheter was replaced.  Her white count at that time was 17.5
with hematocrit of 32.9.  She also had decreased oxygen
saturations in the low 80's on room air and it was felt that
this was consistent with a hospital acquired pneumonia. She
was begun on Levofloxacin 500 mg q d and she greatly
improved.  By postoperative day #10 she was without
complaints, she had completed five days of Levofloxacin, she
had remained afebrile, her Foley catheter was removed and she
was voiding spontaneously approximately 2 liters per day.
She was alert and oriented with a soft nontender, non
distended abdomen with a well healed midline laparotomy
incision.  She did have multiple facial ecchymoses and
swelling that was slowly resolving.  She was on a Heparin
drip at 1,050 unit per hour with a PTT in the 50's.  She had
received four doses of Coumadin as follows, 5 mg, 3 mg, 2 mg
and 2 mg.  Her INR was 1.4.  On [**12-7**] she was ambulating well
with physical therapy and was felt to be stable for discharge
to a rehabilitation center where her anticoagulation could be
worked up and she could have assistance with her activities
of daily living given her left arm fractures and overall
state.  At this time her discharge diet was diabetic.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Status post motor vehicle accident.
2.  Status post trauma splenectomy.
3.  Status post left radius fracture treated by splinting.
4.  Status post left proximal humeral fracture treated with
closed reduction.
5.  Non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus.
6.  Hypertension.
7.  Status post mechanical aortic valve replacement on
anticoagulation.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  Enalapril 20 mg po bid, Lasix 80 mg
