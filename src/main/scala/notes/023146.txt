Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7651**]
Chief Complaint:
Abdominal pain, SOB

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 61836**] is an 87 year-old man, with prior h/o HTN, HL, CAD
s/p CABG in [**2084**] and multiple PCIs, ischemic cardiomyopathy
(15-20%), VT s/p ICD placement in [**10-30**] and VT ablation in [**2108**]
and again [**2-/2112**] and afib on coumadin who presented for
abdominal pain concerning for acute bowel ischemia initally
admitted to the ACS surgery service with concern for acute
mesenteric ischemia on [**3-19**] now in respiratory distress
following volume overload and abrupt initiation of home
anti-hypertensives.
.
He initally presented to [**Hospital1 18**] ED with complaint of abdominal
pain that worsened with walking, eating or lying down. CT and
CTA of abdomen revelaed diffused mesenteric calcification c/w
atherosclerosis and he was noted to have an elevated lactate to
2.4 that was uptrending concerning for bowel ischemia. He was
admitted to the ACS surgical service and received serial
abdominal exams.
.
His anti-hypertensive medications were initally held, and his
abdominal exams remained stable to improved. He received
maintenence IVF at 75cc/hr in addition to 4 x 1L LR boluses. He
is presently 5600ml net positive in terms of volume status since
admission. His anti-hypertensive medications were restarted on
on [**3-21**] and subsequently discontinued on morning of [**3-22**] [**2-24**] to
hypotension. A cardiology consult was requested when the patient
remained relatively hypotensive with [**Name (NI) 5462**] in the 90s despite
stopping home medications and was complaining of shortness of
breath. Cardiology advised diuresis with possible inotropic
support and reinitiation of beta-blockade once BP stable.
.
He was subsequently observed to have continued shortness of
breath despite despite a dose of IV lasix and he was transfered
to the CCU for further managment of hi decompensated CHF. VS on
transfer were SBP:98 HR:100 RR:30 SpO2:94% on 3L NC.

Radiology:
RUQ U/S ([**3-18**]):
IMPRESSION:
1. No sign of acute cholecystitis.
2. Normal liver.
3. Trace ascites.
.
CT Abd/Pelvis ([**3-18**]):
IMPRESSION:
1. Evaluation for patency of vessels and vessel lumen is limited
in the
setting of lack of intravenous contrast. Non-specific small
amount of
perihepatic and intraabdominal ascites. Small right pleural
effusion.

2. No definite evidence of bowel ischemia on this noncontrast CT
exam. If
concern persists for bowel ischemia, repeat CT recommended with
IV contrast.
.
CTA Abd/Pelvis ([**3-19**]):
IMPRESSION:
1. Celiac axis, SMA, and [**Female First Name (un) 899**] are patent.

2. Several nondistended loops of small bowel within the right
lower quadrant demonstrate adjacent focal free fluid and remain
relatively mild thickened since the recent prior examination
four hours prior. Bowel wall thickening is nonspecific and may
be seen in embolic mesenteric ischemia. Persistence is
suspicious, though not definitive.
.
RUQ U/S ([**3-23**]):
CONCLUSION: Findings are compatible with worsening congestive
hepatopathy.  Pulsatile bidirectional portal flow consistent
with tricuspid regurgitation with severe right heart failure.
.
ECHO ([**3-27**]):
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF=
15-20%). The right ventricular cavity is dilated with depressed
free wall contractility. There is abnormal septal
motion/position consistent with right ventricular
pressure/volume overload. There is no aortic valve stenosis.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate (2+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid
regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. [In the setting of at least moderate to severe
