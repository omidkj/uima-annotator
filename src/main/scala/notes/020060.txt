3. Imaging/diagnostics:
- CXR ([**2204-5-7**]): No acute intrathoracic process

Brief Hospital Course:
59 yo F with seizure disorder, hypertension, hyperlipidemia,
diet-controlled diabetes, obstructive sleep apnea, and
fibromyalgia presents after smoke inhalation, with stable
respiratory status.
.
# Smoke inhalation (acute bronchitis from smoke inghalation):
Based on the history, it appears that patient fell asleep due to
the significant psychiatric/pain medications that she is on at
baseline. Although she does have a history of seizure and
depression, this incident is most likely accidental. In the case
of smoke inhalation, upper airway obstruction and carbon
monoxide toxicity would be of greatest concern. Patient's
carboxyhemoglobin level was 9 and had intact mental and
respiratory status, so she was not treated with hyperbaric
oxygen. CXR was unremarkable. She was treated with one dose of
dexamethasone in the ED. ENT consult evaluated the patient and
did not recommend further steroids. Patient was observed
overnight and tolerated food prior to discharge.
.
# Seizure disorder: Seizure unlikely to have been the cause of
the fire. Continued home meds. Phenytoin level subtherapeutic at
8.9 should be followed up by outpatient neurologist.
.
# Hypertension: Normotensive since being admitted. Continued
home meds HCTZ 25 mg po qd and Lisinorpil 40 mg po qd.
.
# Hyperlipidemia/hypercholesterolemia: Significant history
(based on cardiology notes) of poorly controlled
lipid/cholesterol. Continued on home meds Ezetimibe 10 mg po qd
and Rosuvastatin 40 mg po qd.
.
# Diabetes mellitus: Patient kept on diabetic, heart healthy
diet and insulin sliding scale.
.
# Depression/anxiety: Continued on home meds, Bupropion SR 150
mg po qd, Fluoxetine 40 mg po qd, and Quetiapine 300 mg po qd.
.
# Obstructive sleep apnea: Continued on CPAP.
.
# Fibromyalgia/chronic pain: Patient followed by Pain,
Neurology, and Neurosurgery here. Continued on home regimen
