HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 76 year old male with
a history of atrial fibrillation on Coumadin, chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease and hypertension. who was
admitted with an apparent upper GI bleed by report.  The
patient was feeling nonspecifically not well in general and
poor over the last one to two weeks per family.  On the night
of admission around 02:30 a.m. he awoke with the complaint of
an epigastric abdominal pain and indigestion.  He went to see
his primary care physician in the morning on Friday who drew
labs and sent him home.  Later that day, the primary care
physician referred him to the Emergency Department secondary
to patient's complaint of coffee ground emesis.

He went to an outside hospital where he was to be evaluated
for the coffee ground emesis and "blood test" showing
possible gallstones.  While at the outside hospital, the
patient was transferring from the gurney to the abdominal CT
scan when he became apneic and had a PEA arrest.  The patient
was resuscitated at the outside hospital with epinephrine,
Atropine and Amiodarone.  He was intubated.  An NG tube was
placed and recovered more than a liter of coffee ground
emesis.  The patient was hypotensive at the time.  He was
resuscitated with normal saline and his blood pressure
responded.  He was then transferred to [**Hospital1 190**] for definitive care.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Upon arrival to the [**Hospital1 346**] the patient had a pulse of 92, a
blood pressure of 100 to 110 over the 90s.  He was intubated,
paralyzed and sedated on assist control of VTS600, a rate of
12, FIO2 of 100% with PEEP of 5.  Generally, upon admission,
the patient was obese, intubated and sedated.  HEENT revealed
pupils equally round and reactive to light.  Extraocular
movements were not assessed secondary to the intubation and
sedation.  He had no scleral icterus.  He had a large neck.
They were unable to assess for jugular venous distention.
Lungs:  He had diffuse wheezes and increased expiratory
phase.  Cardiovascular revealed heart sounds were distant.
No murmurs, rubs or gallops were appreciated.  Abdomen was
decreased bowel sounds, very obese, soft, nondistended.
Extremities revealed two plus edema bilaterally with chronic
stasis changes.  NG lavage revealed pink clear; it was
Gastroccult positive.

LABORATORY:  Upon admission was white blood cell count of
1.6, hematocrit of 44, platelets of 132.  His Basic Metabolic
Profile revealed a sodium of 129, potassium of 4.3, chloride
of 87, bicarbonate of 29, BUN of 13, creatinine of 0.6,
glucose of 160.  ALT of 20, AST of 30, PTT of 36.6, PTT of
21.4, INR of 2.8.

The patient was admitted to the [**Hospital1 188**] Intensive Care Unit at that time.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Atrial fibrillation on Coumadin.
2.  Hypertension.
3.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
4.  Question of a dropped foot secondary to leg surgery.

ALLERGIES:   He has no known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS PRIOR TO ADMISSION:
1.  Coumadin.
2.  Metoprolol.
3.  Lasix.
4.  Zestril.
5.  [**Doctor First Name **].
6.  Albuterol and Atrovent for his chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient had a long and fairly
complicated hospital course.  He was admitted to the Medical
Intensive Care Unit intubated and sedated with an apparent
upper GI bleed.  The patient was initially transfused two
units of packed red blood cells secondary to his drop in
hematocrit.

Gastrointestinal was consulted to consider endoscopy of the
patient at that time secondary to the apparent upper GI
bleed.  GI Service thought the patient was unstable at that
time to undergo endoscopy and recommended to correct the
patient's coagulopathy as well as to stabilize the patient
hemodynamically prior to scoping.

The patient also subsequently underwent a chest CT scan which
revealed bilateral subsegmental pulmonary embolisms.  While
intubated, the patient also developed a pneumonia, which was
treated with a prolonged course of intravenous antibiotics.
The patient was treated with Ceftriaxone, Flagyl and
Vancomycin for his suspected pneumonia and subsequent sepsis.

The patient also, while in the Intensive Care Unit, developed
a coagulopathy with an INR reaching the [**Location (un) **] of 5.4.
Hematology was consulted secondary to the patient's apparent
auto anti-coagulation.

Hematology believed that the patient had become Vitamin K
deficient and recommended Vitamin K supplementation prior to
beginning Coumadin anti-coagulation therapy for the patient's
pulmonary embolisms as well as for his atrial fibrillation.

While in the Intensive Care Unit, it was noted that the
patient had been volume overloaded and the question of
congestive heart failure was raised.  The patient had a
transesophageal echocardiogram performed which revealed an
ejection fraction of greater than 55%.  The patient was
treated with intravenous Lasix three times a day for volume
overload.  The patient has been diuresing well and has been
minus one to two liters urine output per day.

While in the Intensive Care Unit, it was also noticed that
the patient had undergone a 16 beat run of nonsustained
ventricular tachycardia.  Electrophysiology Service was
consulted.

Electrophysiology Service recommended starting the patient on
a beta blocker secondary to the question of irritable
myocardium.  The patient was placed on a beta blocker and has
had no runs of subsequent nonsustained ventricular
tachycardia since.

The patient was then transferred to the Floor to the service
of the Internal Medicine Floor Service.  Upon transfer, the
patient had a temperature of 98.0 F.; blood pressure of
110/86; heart rate of 88; respiratory rate of 24 and was 94%
on face mask.  He was awake, alert and oriented times three.
His lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally with good
air entry and moderate wheezing throughout.  His
cardiovascular system revealed a regular rate and rhythm; no
murmurs, rubs or gallops.  His abdomen was soft, nontender,
nondistended, with positive bowel sounds.  Extremities
revealed three plus pitting edema on the upper and lower
extremities bilaterally.

While on the floor, the patient remained on hepatin
anti-coagulation.  He was noted to have melanotic stool times
three.  GI was consulted again with the question of
performing upper endoscopy on the patient.  The patient's
Coumadin was held and the patient was kept NPO overnight.
The patient underwent an esophagogastroduodenoscopy on
[**2190-9-23**].  Per GI, it was noted that the patient had no
active bleeding in the stomach, some mild erythema in the
stomach as well as some white plaque ulcerations that were
subsequently biopsied.  The biopsies were pending analysis
per this dictation.

The patient has remained hemodynamically stable on the floor.
His hematocrit has remained stable.  The hematocrit has
remained in the low 30s throughout the patient's stay on the
floor.  The patient will be anti-coagulated with Coumadin for
his atrial fibrillation as well as his pulmonary emboli.

The patient will be kept in house for the overlap of the
therapy prior to discharge secondary to the potential for
rebleed.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Upper gastrointestinal bleed.
2.  PEA arrest status post resuscitation.
3.  Bilateral subsegmental pulmonary emboli.
4.  Pneumonia.
5.  Atrial fibrillation.
6.  Nonsustained ventricular tachycardia.
7.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
8.  Hypertension.
9.  Coagulopathy secondary to Vitamin K deficiency.

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:   Stable.

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:
1.  The patient is to be discharged to long-term subacute
rehabilitation for continuing anti-coagulation as well as
Physical Therapy subsequent to the patient's deconditioning.


A further Addendum will be dictated pending the patient's
final discharge.
