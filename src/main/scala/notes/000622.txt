Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 710**]
Chief Complaint:
Altered mental status

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
71 year-old M with esophageal Ca s/p recent lap esophagectomy
who presents with altered MS, intubated in ED for MRI to r/o
spinal cord process.  History is obtained per chart, as
patient's wife is not reachable by telephone.  She had reported
mental status changes and confusion starting yesterday.  He also
had worsened abdominal pain.  She denied any fever, chills,
diarrhea, or vomiting.
.
Of note, he had his J-tube changed in Dr.[**Name (NI) 1482**] office 2
weeks prior due to obstruction.
.
In the ED surgery was consulted to rule out surgical issues.  A
foley was placed with 1 L of urine, with good relief of
abdominal pain.  He received morphine 2mg IV x 2 and ativan 2 mg
IV.  He also received levoflox 500 mg and flagyl 500 mg for
concern for GI pathology.  Out of concern for spinal abscess or
cord compression, he underwent intubation with propofol and
fentanyl.  Post-intubation he became bradycardic to 24 but
spontaneously resolved before atropine could be given.  He also
vomited peri-intubation.  He received 5L NS in total in the ED.
..
On exam he denies abdominal or back pain.

Brief Hospital Course:
Assessment and Plan:  71 year-old M s/p recent lap esophagectomy
who presents with altered MS, intubated in ED for MRI to r/o
spinal cord process.
.
* Altered MS: In the emergency room, a Foley catheter was placed
upon arrival which found 1000cc urine. Due to urinary retention
and the patient's delirium and inability to follow commands,
there was concern for cauda equina vs. epidural abscess/mass.
The patient was intubated in the ED and transferred for an
emergent lumbar and sacral MRI. There were no abnormalities
found. The patient was transferred to the ICU intubated for
further management. A Head CT and UA were normal. Mild
hyponatremia was noted. A serum tox screen was negative.  The
patient was afebrile with nl white count. Ambien and Celexa were
held. A surgery consult was obtained which determined that the
patient's Jtube site was not infected. The patient was extubated
and transferred to the medicine service on Hospital Day 2. He
was alert and oriented x 2, however he was noted to have slow
verbal response times but was overall alert and able to carry on
shortened conversation.
.
Upon transfer to the floor, the patient was noted to be
delirious. He was speaking Spanish and no longer speaking
English (English is primary language and has never spoken
spanish before according to his wife). A psychiatry and
neurology consult was obtained to which both thought that the
etiology of this language shift was likely acute delirium. The
patient had a 1:1 sitter. Blood cultures from admission returned
negative. A Head MRI was obtained which was negative for masses
or acute event.
.
The patient's delirium improved over time. Neurology felt that
there was no acute neurological issue that could cause this
language shift. Psychiatry believed that this language shift was
likely due to resolving delirium on top of longer-standing
depression and a new conversion disorder.  Remeron was started.
.
Psychiatry continued to follow the patient closely; he improved
spontaneously and with the addition of Remeron. The patient was
discharged to home with an outpatient partial psych
hospitalization program set up.
.
* Hyponatremia: The patient was rehydrated in the ED with 5L NS
and the Na did not improve. TSH, cortisol were normal. Serum
osms were noted to be low indicating that there was excessive
ADH secretion. Fluid restriction to 1500cc per day corrected the
patient's hyponatremia. A nutrition consult was obtained and the
patient's tube feeds were changed to Nutren 2.0 for a more
concentrated formula with no free water. He was discharged on
this Nutren 2.0 formula. His sodium remained normal x 3 days at
the end of his hospitalization.
.
* Esophageal Ca s/p esophagectomy
The patient was continued on his Jtube feeds as above and his
outpatient regimen of isoprostol and carafate and prevacid and
lansoprazole. The patient tolerated small amounts of regular
food.
.
* Urinary Retention:
The patient failed two voiding trials; his Flomax was increased
to 0.8 and on the third voiding trial, he was able to void
spontaneously with this new increase in medication. The patient
did not receive any narcotics or any anti-cholinergics.
.
*Prophylaxis: PPI, SC heparin, bowel regimen
