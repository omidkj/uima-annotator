Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Amiodarone

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 425**]
Chief Complaint:
Atrial fibrillation w/ RVR, VT s/p ICD firing, SDH

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
32yoM with h/o dilated cardiomyopathy (EF 20%) s/p ICD placement
[**3-/2119**], chronic a. fib on coumadin who initially presented to
[**Hospital **] hospital on [**2121-9-12**] after having had a syncopal event.
He does not remember much about the event, he has had
presyncopal episodes associated with postural change in the
past, but has never actually fallen until now.  He does not
remember if their was a prodrome associated with this event.  He
was found to have a SDH secondary to hitting his head with this
syncopal event, he was then transferred to [**Hospital1 112**] for further care.
 His ICD was interrogated and revealed VT as etiology of his
syncope.  During his hospitalization at [**Hospital1 112**], he had two
generalized ?tonic clonic seizures and was started on dilantin.
His neuro status remained stable without furher seizures and he
was discharged directly to Dr.[**Name (NI) 1565**] device clinic on
[**2121-9-19**].  There, he was noted to be in a. fib with RVR.  He
additionally was complaining of headache at that time so he was
referred to our ED for head imaging and improved rate control
for his a. fib.
.
Initial imaging upon presentation to our ED revealed a
right-sided subdural hematoma measuring up to 8 mm causing
effacement of right cerebral sulci, right lateral ventricle,
with 5-mm shift of midline structures, right inferior frontal
lobe parenchymal hemorrhage with surrounding edema, and left
occipital lobe encephalomalacia, compatible with prior infarct.
He was admitted to the CCU with neurosurgery as the primary
team.  Imaging was obtained from [**Hospital1 112**] and CT head is stable in
appearance from his admission there.  Additionally, repeat head
CT yesterday ([**2121-9-20**]) is stable.  His head pain is currently
improving but somewhat variable.
.
Of note, he was recently admitted at this facility for a CHF
exacerbation ([**2121-9-3**]) in setting of medication non-adherence
and increased fluid intake and was d/c'd on [**2121-9-4**] following
diuresis.
.
He was then called out to the cardiology service for uptitration
of his rate control for atrial fibrillation.  He is
occassionally symptomatic from his atrial fibrillation and feels
fast heart rate/palpitations.  He has not noted that these
sensations have worsened or gotten more frequent over the past
few weeks.

.

Social History:

PA AND LATERAL RADIOGRAPHS OF THE CHEST: Single chamber
pacemaker is in unchanged position, with lead projecting over
the right ventricle. Moderate to severe cardiomegaly is
unchanged. The lungs remain clear, with no focal consolidation
or edema. There is no effusion or pneumothorax. Old right rib
fractures are noted.
IMPRESSION: Persistent moderate to severe cardiomegaly. No acute
cardiopulmonary process
.
.Non-contrast head CT ([**9-19**]). There is a 1.9 x 1.8 cm
intraparenchymal hemorrhage in the right inferior frontal lobe
with surrounding edema. Additionally, there is a subdural
hematoma (maximally 8mm) along the right cerebral hemisphere
with resultant effacement of the right cerebral sulci and
effacement of the right lateral ventricle causing subfalcine
herniation and approximately 5 mm of shift of midline
structures. There is no evidence of uncal herniation. Basilar
cisterns are patent. Encephalomalacia in the left occipital lobe
is noted, which is related to prior infarct which was
demonstrated on prior CTs. The calvarium appears intact. The
mastoid air cells, middle ear cavities, and paranasal sinuses
are clear. Orbits appear unremarkable, though incompletely
imaged.
IMPRESSION:
1. Right-sided subdural hematoma measuring up to 8 mm causing
effacement of right cerebral sulci, right lateral ventricle,
with 5-mm shift of midline structures.
2. Right inferior frontal lobe parenchymal hemorrhage with
surrounding edema.
3. Left occipital lobe encephalomalacia, compatible with prior
infarct.
4. Motion limits evaluation.
.
Repeat head CT [**9-20**]: IMPRESSION: Unchanged appearance of right
frontal intraparenchymal hemorrhage and subdural hematoma along
the right convexity. The extent of mass effect and sulcal
effacement is unchanged from [**2121-9-19**].
.
Lower extremity non-invasives [**2121-9-25**]
FINDINGS: Doppler waveform analysis reveals a triphasic waveform
at the right common femoral artery. There are monophasic
waveforms at the right popliteal and posterior tibial. The right
dorsalis pedis is absent. The right ABI is 0.76. The right toe
pressure is 43 with a toe brachial index of 0.43. On the left
there are triphasic waveforms at the common femoral, popliteal,
posterior tibial and dorsalis pedis. The ABI is 1.0, the toe
pressure is 68 with a toe brachial index of 0.68.

Pulse volume recordings show significantly dampened waveform in
the right thigh. There is additional dampening at the level of
the metatarsal
