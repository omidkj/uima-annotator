History of Present Illness:
56 y/o woman w/CLL on her fourth cycle of chemotherapy who is
admitted to the [**Hospital Ward Name **] ICU after presenting to the emergency
departement with fever, tachycardia, neutropenia, and
hypotension.
.
She began chemotherapy with her first cycle in [**2128-10-20**] and
this was complicated by febrile neutropenia and pansensative
ecoli sepsis. She was seen in clinic today for routine follow up
for a coutn check as she was day +11 from [**Hospital1 **]. She was feeling
fatigued and had a HR of 150. She was given 1LNS and cultures
were sent. She continued to feel poorly, with fatigue and
malaise. She was checking her temperature and when it hit 104.5
she contact[**Name (NI) **] the oncologist on call and came to the emergency
department. She took a dose of levofloxacin orally at home prior
to comming to the ED.
.
In the ED, she was febrile to 106.6, had a WBC of 0.2, platelets
of 11, Hct 29 and a HR to 170 that appeared sinus tach. She was
given a total of 6L NS, Vancomycin, Cefepime and Caspofungin.
She had 2 bags of platelets infused and a right IJ was placed.

Portable TTE (Complete) Done [**2129-2-25**] at 2:03:27 PM:  The left
atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are
normal. The left ventricular cavity size is borderline dilated.
There is severe global left ventricular hypokinesis.
Quantitative (biplane) LVEF = 21%. The estimated cardiac index
is depressed (1.7 L/min/m2). Right ventricular chamber size is
normal. with mild global free wall hypokinesis. The aortic root
is mildly dilated at the sinus level. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and
no aortic regurgitation. No masses or vegetations are seen on
the aortic valve. The mitral valve leaflets are structurally
normal. No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve. Mild
(1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The estimated pulmonary
artery systolic pressure is normal. There is no pericardial
effusion.

IMPRESSION: No vegetations or clinically-significant regurgitant
valvular disease seen (good-quality study). Severe global left
ventricular systolic dysfunction. Mild right ventricular
systolic dysfunction.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2129-2-11**],
left ventricular cavity is larger. Biventricular systolic
function (especially LV function) has significantly
deteriorated.

Brief Hospital Course:
56 y/o woman with CLL s/p 4 cycles of [**Hospital1 **] treatment on
Neupogen s/p febrile neutropenia and septic shock requiring [**Hospital Unit Name 153**]
stay, [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] course described below per day:

In the ED T 102.9, P170, BP 113/65, 100% on RA. While there her
BP dropped to 74/33, T to 106.6. She received 8L NS, cefepime
2gm, vancomycin 1gm, caspo 70, platelets 2u, and decadron 10mg.
She was admitted to the [**Hospital Ward Name 332**] ICU, central access obtained,
received an additional 10L of fluid, required 3 pressors to
maintain MAP > 60. She also received zosyn x 1 and gentamicin x
1. The primary team thought they saw parasites on a peripheral
smear and ID was consulted. Was weaned off pressors on [**2-25**] with
MAP > 65. Her blood cultures grew Klebsiella on [**2129-2-24**]. C.
difficile toxin negative x 2, O&P negative x 3, UCx w/NGTD on
[**2-24**] and [**2-25**]. In addition, a new echo was done which demonstrated
LVEF of 21% with severe global left ventricular systolic
dysfunction, a deterioration from echo on [**2129-2-11**]. Pt. also had
episodes of hematochezia and dropped to 24.3 on [**2-26**], GI
consulted and concluded that bleeding is likely from polyp
documented on previous colonoscopy, deferred colonoscopy to
outpatient setting unless bleeding increases. In addition had
asymptomatic episodes of brady to 40, sinus w/ no evidence of
1st degree/2nd degree heart block. Had received 2 units PRBC's
and 1 unit of platelets during [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] stay.

[**Hospital Unit Name 13533**]
======================
[**2129-2-25**]
-Initially was on three pressors but weaned off over the course
of the day with preservation of MAP's >65
-Blood cultures with GNR's, caspofungin discontinued (OK w/
hematology and oncology)
-Echo showed new LV dysfunction with LVEF 20% per echo (new
since [**2129-2-11**])
-Had hematochezia and AM Hct 24 and Plt 9. Ordered for one unit
of blood and one unit platelets.
