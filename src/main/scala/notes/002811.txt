Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Aspirin / Penicillins / Vancomycin / Iodine / Nsaids / Lyrica

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1436**]
Chief Complaint:
Aspirin Desensitization

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
cardiac catheterization and stents to RCA.


History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 68 y/o W with history of CAD, w/ CABG in [**2143**] w/
LIMA to LAD and SVG from RIMA to Marginal branch of circumflex,
DM (last A1c 8.9), recurrent CVA's in past w/o residual
weakness, COPD (on 3L NC at baseline) who presented to [**Hospital 1514**]
Hospital on [**2152-10-4**] c/o chest pain.  Patient described the
acute onset of sharp substernal chest pain with radiation to her
left arm while getting up to use the bathroom at home.  This
episode was associated with dizzyness, some diaphoresis, nausea,
mild shortness of breath but without syncope emesis or other
complaints.  She activated EMS and was brought to [**Hospital 1514**]
Hospital where she was admitted as a ROMI.
.
Additionally, patient reports history of intermittent chest pain
over several years with multiple hospitalizations in the past.
Also reports increasing chest pain about once per month over the
past year but increasing in severity and frequency.  In
addition, she describes requiring less exertion to precipitate
her episodes.  Patient reports orthopnea at baseline and sleeps
upright in her recliner as a result.  Reports baseline
peripheral edema as well with occasional PND.  Is wheelchair
dependent at baseline.  Cardiac review of systems is notable for
absence of palpitations, syncope or presyncope.
.
At the OSH, patient's cardiac enzymes were negative, but repeat
EKG's showed TWI's in V2-V5 stable over several EKG's.  Cards
consult recommended performing diagnostic cath which was
performed [**10-9**] demonstrating:
 - Severe 3 vessel CAD
 - High Grade Stenosis (85%) of dominant RCA which is
non-revascularized.
 - Diffuse narrowing of the distal RCA with 70% stenosis.
 - Proximal LAD w/ 30% stenosis and stent, and mid-LAD with 100%
occluded stent, but distal LAD with supply from LIMA.
 - Circumflex with Mid 45% stenosis.
.
Impression at OSH was that the patient would benefit from
stenting of the proximal RCA stenosis with a DES.  Patient was
then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for aspirin desensitization and
stenting.
.
On review of symptoms, she denies any prior history of bleeding
at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough,
hemoptysis, black stools or red stools. He denies recent fevers,
chills or rigors. She denies exertional buttock or calf pain.
She does report occasional headaches.

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient was admitted to the CCU for management:
.
#1)ASA Desensitization was accomplished using the standard
protocol without complication.
.
#2)CAD: Performed [**2152-10-12**] and 2 drug eluting stents were placed
in the RCA. Pt. remains chest pain free. Lopressor, Zocor and
Imdur were continued. She will need Plavix 76 mg daily,
uninterrupted for 12 months. It may only be stopped under the
direction of Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]. She will need to take aspirin
lifelong. EKG shows Sinus rhythm and is without changes.

#3)Diabetes: NPH dose was adjusted in [**Location (un) 1514**] Hopsital due to
glucose elevations.  Glucose remained elevated with NaHCo3
infusion during and after cardiac cathetherization. NPH dose now
resembles home dose. Glucose values ranged from 133,265,335, 406
during this admission and she was given Regular insulin sliding
scale as needed.  She will require continued monitoring and
treatment.

Pt. continues with multiple medications for peripheral
neiropathy.  She is wheelchair bound.  She declined Physical
Therapy evaluation on [**2152-10-13**]. She has a history of falls.  Most
recent fall at home was 2 weeks ago. She will need further
evaluation of this staus prior to returning home safely. She may
benefit from rehabilitation, however she declines this option at
this time.

#4) HTN:  Norvasc was added for improved blood pressure control.
We recommend considering Ace inhibitor after settling from
cardiac cath if creatinine is stable. Blood pressure range is
from 109/52-209/73. She will need continue monitoring and
treatment.

#5) Chronic renal insufficiency: Creatinine was 1.4 on [**2152-10-12**].
She was prehydrated with NaHCo3 before and during
catheterization procedure.
