[**2181-5-14**]  Abdominal CT:1. Pneumatosis of the cecal wall
without evidence of portal venous gas. Mild
dilatation of the large and small bowel loops without evidence
of discrete
transition point. No pneumoperitoneum. Limited evaluation for
bowel wall
ischemia and vessel patency in the absence of IV contrast.
2. Dilated right renal collecting system suggestive of
ureteropelvic
obstruction. No obstructing stone identified.
3. Cholelithiasis without evidence of acute c

[**2181-5-15**] TEE:

The left atrium is moderately dilated. Due to suboptimal
technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be
fully excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
normal (LVEF>55%. . The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. Mild to
moderate ([**11-24**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Moderate [2+]
tricuspid regurgitation is seen.Overall right ventricular
function is depressed

[**2181-5-22**] Left Hip: IMPRESSION:

Left intertrochanteric femur fracture with DHS fixation. Notable
backing-out
of the dynamic screw compared to intra-operative radiograph


Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 29878**] as admitted to the hospital and had an abdominal
CT which showed pneumatosis around the cecum and soon became
hypotensive requiring fluid resuscitation and pressors.  She
developed peritoneal signs on exam and was urgently taken to the
Operating Room where she underwent a subtotal colectomy and
splenectomy.

She returned to the SICU in stable condition but remained
intubated and required some pressor support and fluids post op.
She had some brief sinus bradycardia to the 30's  on post op day
#1 and then developed atrial fibrillation. Cardiac enzymes were
flat x 3 but she had a prolonged qtc on her EKG.  Cardiology was
consulted and recommended TEE which was done on [**2181-5-15**] which
revealed an EF >55% and no wall motion abnormalities.
Continuation of her amiodarone was recommended and she had no
further episodes of bradycardia.

She was extubated on post op day #3 and did well.  She underwent
vigorous pulmonary toilet including chest PT and incentive
spirometry and was able to remain free of any pulmonary
complications post op.

Following extubation she was sent to the [**Date Range **] floor for
further monitoring where she continued to make slow progress.
She gradually began a clear liquid diet and was eventually
increased to regular without difficulty. She did have a speech
and swallow evaluation which showed no evidence of aspiration.
Prior to her hospitalization she was taking Ensure supplements
and she continues to do so.  Her incision was healing well and
she was seen by the ostomy nurse for instructions and caring for
her ileostomy.

She was followed by the orthopedic service post op for
evaluation after her recent left hip surgery and she was also
seen daily by the Physical Therapist.  Her activity status was
touch-down weight bearing.  She did have left hip films done on
[**2181-5-22**] which showed some backing out of the intertrocanteric
screw.  These were reviewed by orthopedics and her activity
status will remain the same.  They will follow her with serial
xrays and a follow uo appointment in 6 weeks.

Due to a persistent leukocytosis post op multiple cultures were
done including B
blood, urine and stool for CDiff.  All were negative and she
remained afebrile without bandemia however her WBC was in the
20-26K range.

Ms. [**Known lastname 29878**] was very discouraged during her hospitalization
because of her recent setback after hip surgery.  Through
intervention with the staff including our social worker ,
encouragement was given and she wanted to be able to eventually
go back to the [**Location (un) **] and be able to take care of herself. She
was discharged to rehab with the [**Known firstname **] of returning home in a
month or so and she will follow up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] and [**Location (un) **]
for further evaluation.
