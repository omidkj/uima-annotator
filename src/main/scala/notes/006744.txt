Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2641**]
Chief Complaint:
weakness

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Resection of C5-C6 intradural mass along with laminectomy


History of Present Illness:
71M with a history of melanoma, s/p wide local excision and
sentinel LN Bx in [**2100**] for 0.8 mm thick, [**Doctor Last Name 10834**] level IV
melanoma located in the R-posterior auricular area admitted with
new metastitic melanoma. In [**2100**], sentinel LN Bx showed melanoma
so pt underwent a complete node dissection with no residual
melanoma documented in the remaining nodes. He did well until
[**2103-1-2**] when a second melanoma, 1.3 mm thick, [**Doctor Last Name 10834**] level IV
was found in the R-submental area. Pt underwent a wide local
excision and sentinel LN Bx with the sentinel LN w/o evidence of
melanoma. Pt then did well until approximately 6 weeks ago. At
that time, he noted increased neck pain and pain in his upper
and lower extremities. The pt saw his PCP at that time who
treated him with NSAIDs and muscle relaxants. However, four
weeks ago, the pt noted two small moles on the right side of his
scalp. He saw his dermatologist who did punch biopsies
consistent with melanoma. At that time, the pt contact[**Name (NI) **] his
oncologist and was referred to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1729**] at [**Hospital1 18**] for further
care. The plan was for the pt to come to [**Hospital1 18**] this week for MRI
and PET scan. However, last Thursday, the pt developed sudden
onset weakness of his lower extremities resulting in a fall. The
pt reports that the strength in his LE returned and he was able
to walk normally over the weekend. However, on Monday, his LE
once again felt very weak and he had trouble walking and a
repeat fall. At that time, he called Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1729**] and was advised
to come in for evaluation.

Pt attempted to come to [**Hospital1 18**] but no beds were available so he
went to [**Hospital 1562**] Hospital for further care. At the OSH, he
received a MRI of the cervical spine on [**2-24**] that showed an
enhancing, likely malignant extradural lesion at the level of
mid C5 to mid C6 displacing the sac and cord posteriorly. This
was felt to be consistent with metastitic disease. Screening
sagittal views of the spine demonstrated no other abnormalities.
Pt also underwent a MRI of the brain that showed diffuse age
related changes but no evidence of malignancy. At the OSH, the
pt was placed on emperic Decadron 10 mg IV loading dose followed
by 4 mg IV Q6H. This was continued following the MRI findings.
Pt was also given morphine for pain. He is now transferred to
[**Hospital1 18**] for further oncologic and neurosurgical care.

In further ROS, pt denies fevers and chills. He reports that he
has chronic, intermittent headaches that are unchanged. No CP or
palpitations. No SOB. Pt has a mild cough lately that is rarely
productive of a small amount of sputum. No abdominal pain,
nausea, or vomiting. Good appetite. Pt suffers from occasional
constipation but has moved his bowels in the last couple of
days. No dysuria or hematuria.

[**2-27**] ct chest, abd, pelvis:
CT OF THE CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST: Small axillary lymph nodes,
but none of
them meet CT criteria for pathology. The largest one on the
right side
measures 5 mm and the largest one on the left side measures 6
mm. There are 2
enlarged mediastinal lymphnodes. The largest one is located on
series 3 image
18, and measures 1.7 mm in the precarinal region. The other one
is
pretracheal and measures 1.4 cm.There are no significant hilar
lymph nodes.
The heart and great vessels are unremarkable. There is a
subcutaneous soft
tissue density seen on series 3 image 9 that measures 7 mm in
the anterior
chest wall. In the setting of melanoma, this could represent
metastasis.

Innumerable lung nodules consistent with metastasis. The largest
one in the
right upper lobe measures 1.4 x 1.4 cm. There are no pleural
effusions and no
evidence of pneumothorax.

CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT AND WITH IV CONTRAST: There is a
hypodense lesion
in the segment 7 of the right lobe of the liver that measures
2.7 x 2.1 cm and
could represent a liver metastasis. There are also 2 possible
faint lesions
in the left lobe of the liver. One of them is in the segment 2
of the liver
just on the left side of the falciform that is too small to
characterize.

There is right adrenal nodule that measures 2.0 x 1.4 cm. It
measures 50
Hounsfield units in the noncontrast images and could represent
metastasis, but
is not well characterized in this study. There is a nodule
(series 3 image
48) in the paraspinal region that may represent metastasis. Just
above it
(series 2 image 44), there is a increased density adjacent to
the diaphragm.
that could represent a small pleural effusion or less likely
could represent
metastatic disease. The kidneys and left adrenal gland are
unremarkable. The
pancreas is unremarkable. The ureters are unremarkable. The
small and large
bowel appears unremarkable. In the abdomen, there is a lymph
node in the left
paracolic gutter (series 4 image 46) that measures 8 mm and is
of a normal
significance. It could represent a small lymph node or
metastatic disease. In
the right lower quadrant just below the right kidney, there is
another nodule
that measures 7 mm (series 4 image 48). There is also a lymph
node. Multiple
other small mesenteric lymp nodes are seen, but none of them
meet CT criteria
for pathology.

CT OF THE PELVIS WITH ORAL AND IV CONTRAST: The urinary bladder,
distal
ureters, prostate, and seminal vesicles are unremarkable. The
rectum and
intrapelvic bowel loops are unremarkable. There are small mid
iliac lymph
nodes that do not meet CT criteria for pathology. The largest
one located in
the right side (series 4 image 63) measures 8 mm and contains a
fatty hilum.
Small inguinal lymph nodes do not meet CT criteria for
pathology. The largest
one is located on the right inguinal region and measures 8 mm.

BONE WINDOWS: No obvious destructive lesions seen.
