This is a 53 year old male with known AS/bicuspid valve. Over
the past several months, he admits to progressive dyspnea on
exertion and chest pain. He also reports one syncopal episode.
His symptoms resolve with rest.

At age 13, he underwent repair of his congenital aortic
coarctation. He also has a history of TIA in [**2194**] which
presented as facial droop and right sided paresis. This episode
completely resolved within 3 hours.

He has been followed by serial ECHO's. An ECHO back in [**Month (only) 547**]
[**2199**] showed severe AS with [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Location (un) 109**] of 0.7 cm2. His peak gradient
was 120 mmHg with a mean of 93. There was 2+ AI and his LVEF was
estimated at 60%.

Elective cardiac catheterization on [**2200-5-28**] confirmed severe AS
with [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Location (un) 109**] of 0.4 cm2. Peak gradient 90 with mean of 59 mmHg.
There was 3+ AI. Aortic root measured 3.2 cm. There was no
gradient across coarctation. CI estimated at 2.1 with LVEDP of
21. Angiography was notable for only a 40% lesion in the
circumflex  -  coronary arteries were otherwise clean. Based on
the above results, he was referred for cardiac surgical
intervention.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was admitted on [**6-25**] and underwent an aortic
valve replacement(25 millimeter CE Magna pericardial valve) by
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1290**]. Surgery was uneventful. Following the operation,
he was brought to the CSRU. Within 24 hours, he was extubated
and weaned from intravenous therapy. Low dose beta blockade was
initiated. He maintained stable hemodynamics and transferred to
the SDU on postoperative day one. He was diuresed toward his
preoperative weight. Beta blockade was advanced as tolerated. He
remained in a normal sinus rhythm. By discharge, his oxygen
saturations were 97% on room air. He was cleared for discharge
to home on postoperative day three.e He is scheduled to follow
up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and his local cardiologist.
