Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 290**]
Chief Complaint:
acute cholecystitis in the setting of atrial fibrillation with
RVR


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a [**Age over 90 **]y/o lady with a-fib on Coumadin, and diastolic
HF, who is admitted to the MICU with acute cholecystitis in the
setting of rapid atrial fibrillation.  She initially presented
to an OSH ([**Hospital3 **]) on [**7-20**] due to elevated INR of 12 on
labs drawn at home, and upon arrival was found to have abdominal
pain, RR 22, and O2 sat of 95% on RA in the setting of an INR of
9.8, WBC 13.1, and T Bili 2.2. Abd CT revealed cholelithiasis
with external biliary duct dilatation (unchanged from CT on
[**2142-7-3**]).  HIDA scan was positive for acute cholecystitis.  She
was in atrial fibrillation with RVR, and due to her
age/comorbidities, she was considered to not be a surgical
candidate so she was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] today for ERCP and
percutaneous cholecystostomy.
.
In the ED, initial vs were: T 98, P 104, BP 98/60, R 18, O2 sat
96% 4L NC.
She was in A-fib with RVR.  Her WBC were 21.5, and her LFTs were
significant for elevated T Bili and Alk Phos.  She was given
500cc NS.  She was evaluated with US (which showed acute
cholecystitis) and abdomen CT to rule out gangrenous
cholecysttis. She was given Unasyn and Vancomycin and was sent
to the ICU.
.

Gangrenous cholecystitis cannot be excluded in this study. If
continued clinical concern, a CT can be considered for better
characterization.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a [**Age over 90 **]y/o lady who was admitted to the ICU with acute
cholecystitis and a-fib with RVR.
.
#. Large gallstone and RUQ pain: likely chronic cholecystitis.
Her exam was concerning for acute cholecystitis, and her
leukocytosis and OSH HIDA scan was suggestive of this as well.
Upon imaging here, her gallbadder lumen appeared to be entirely
occupied with the stone, which could also explain the positive
HIDA scan at OSH.  The gall bladder was not distended, and there
appeared to be no duct obsruction.  After discussion with
Surgery/I.R./ERCP attendings, it was determined that the risks
of interventions outweighed the benefits.  She is a poor
candidate for surgery given her age and comorbidities; there was
no lumen to drain percutaneously by I.R.; there was no
obstructing stone to be cleared by ERCP.  She was managed
conservatively with pain management (IV Dilaudid and TID
Acetaminophen).  The patient and her family elected for DNR/DNI,
CMO status and efforts were focused on pain control.  Her pain
subsided throughout the hospital stay, and by the time of
discharge she had some RUQ pain to deep palpation, which was
relieved by Dilaudid.
Her WBC started to trend down and was 26 at the time of d/c.
Though clinically and radiographically she does not appear to
have cholangitis, she was kept on antibiotics to cover for any
infection.  She has been on Zosyn, and was sent to a [**Hospital1 1501**] with a
PICC line to complete a 10 day course of antibiotics (last day
will be [**2142-8-10**]).
.
#. Diastolic CHF: with AS, severe TR, LA/RA dilatation.  At
baseline she has dyspnea on exertion and she has been
hospitalized multiple times for CHF exacerbations.  Diltiazem
was continued.  She had been off her home dose of Lasix since
admission to OSH; she was started on a Lasix drip and was
diuresed.  Her urine output did not seem to respond and she
remained extremely edematous.  Discussions with family centered
around the irreversible nature of her CHF, and her seemingly
refractory edema was another reason that they decided to make
her CMO.  Efforts were still made to diurese the patient for her
own comfort, and she is being discharged on diuretics (Lasix
60mg PO TID). She will need daily Basic Metabolic Panels to
monitor her renal function and electrolytes.
.
#. Atrial Fibrillation: since arriving in the ICU, she was not
in RVR.  Her Digoxin was continued, as was her Diltiazem (as her
BPs tolerated).  Her Coumadin was held during her stay because
of supratherapeutic INR, and at the time of disc
