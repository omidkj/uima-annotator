Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2782**]
Chief Complaint:
s/p fall


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
83F transferred from [**Hospital3 1443**] Hospital for acute on
chronic subdural hematoma. Pt reported that she fell while
trying to get to the bathroom from bed, not sure from bed or
while walking.  She said she hit her head.  Fall was unwitnessed
at nursing home. Patient was found on the floor by staff
complaining of left-sided head pain.  It was unclear whether pt
loss consciousness, but she seemed to remembered the event, but
could not relate how she fell or the circumstances around on.
Per the nursing home she was last seen in bed 2 hours prior to
being found in the floor.  Pt admits more frequent urination,
poor po intake, but denied fever, chill, change in vision, CP,
palpitation, SOB, N/V/D, dysuria or weakness of her extremities.
 Per her cousin, pt was quite functinoal at baseline, active in
nursing home activities and very talkive.
.
Pt was initially sent to [**Hospital3 1443**] Hospital, where she
was cleared for C-spine.  CT-head showed subdural hematoma.  Pt
was sent to [**Hospital1 18**] or further management.
.
In the [**Name (NI) **], Pt was afebrile, 92, 92/44, 17-19, 94-96% on 2L.  She
had WBC of 14.1, Cr 1.2, troponin 0.03 with flat CKMB, EKG
consistent with RV pacing with no ST-segment changes, CT-head
was stable with no interval worsening, CXR has some haziness in
RLL/RML.  Pt was evaluated by neurosurgery team.  She received
vancomycin and zosyn for HCAP and 500 cc NS at 75 cc/hr.
.
On arrival to the MICU, pt continue to be afebrile with SBP
decreased to 80s.  After starting NS at 75 cc/hr, her SBP
improved to 100s.

Past Medical History:
Anemia
Hypothyroidism
CHF (previously uncharacterized, normal TTE while at [**Hospital1 18**]
[**2157-9-17**])
History of falls and unstable gait
Depression
Status post pacer (?heart block)
Hyperlipidemia
GERD
Hx of left humeral fracture


Social History:
Pt lives at Brighten at [**Location (un) 1468**].  Per her cousin, she was quite
active and functional at baseline.  Pt worked at government
center for a long term.  Denies smoking, alcohol or recreational
drug use.

PERTINENT STUDIES
CXR ([**10-2**]):
IMPRESSION: Mild pulmonary edema superimposed on basilar
interstitial lung
process with possibly underlying emphysema. Nodular opacity at
the right lung base may relate to underlying fibrosis, but an
underlying nodule is not excluded and could be further evaluated
for on chest CT as clinically
appropriate. Possible small bilateral pleural effusions.

Reverse C-shaped calcific density projecting over the heart
likely represents mitral annulus calcification. This could be
confirmed with PA and lateral views.
.
CXR ([**10-7**]):
IMPRESSION:
Right PICC line ends at lower SVC. There is no pneumothorax. A
single lead
from left pectoral pacemaker device ends into the right
ventricle. Dense
calcification of mitral valve annulus is present. Since [**10-4**], [**2156**],
moderate to sever pulmonary edema, moderate to large right and
mild left
pleural effusions are new. Mild cardiomegaly is stable.
Mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged.
.
CXR ([**10-11**]):
IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**10-3**] through 21:

Pulmonary edema which improved between [**10-3**] and [**10-4**]
returned with a large pleural effusion on [**10-7**] and made it
impossible to say whether pneumonia has changed. Today, there is
less of a moderate-sized right pleural effusion. Small left
pleural effusion is stable. There is at least some pulmonary
edema and very heterogeneous opacification in the right lung and
at the left lung base, all of which makes it difficult to
distinguish edema from pneumonia.

Heart is mildly enlarged, predominantly due to a very dilated
left atrium as denoted by the heavily calcified mitral annulus
which can contribute to mitral regurgitation. No pneumothorax is
present. Transvenous right ventricular pacer lead is unchanged
in the expected position.
.

CT HEAD w/o contrast ([**10-2**])
IMPRESSION:
1. Slight increase in the right frontotemporal subdural
hematoma,
particularly inferiorly at the frontotemporal junction now
measuring 12 mm in maximum transverse dimension. No change in
mass effect.
2. No evidence of subfalcine or transtentorial herniation.
3. No new intra- or extra-axial hemorrhage outside of the
previously
described subdural collection.
4. Stable global atrophy and small vessel ischemic changes.
.
CT HEAD w/o contrast ([**10-4**]):
IMPRESSION: Right frontotemporal subdural hematoma, unchanged.
.
TTE ([**10-12**]):
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function are normal
(LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall
motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
present. Trace ao
