Chief Complaint:
Pre-cath hydration

Cartotid angiogram

History of Present Illness:
71 yo F with history of CAD, severe PVD, DM, HTN who presents
for pre-cath hydration prior to carotid angiogram. Patient has a

LENIS [**2178-2-9**]:
FINDINGS: Grayscale and Doppler son[**Name (NI) 1417**] of bilateral common
femoral, superficial femoral and popliteal veins were performed.
There is normal compressibility, flow and augmentation. Flow in
the visualized superficial calf veins is normal.

IMPRESSION: No evidence of DVT.
.
Cath [**2178-2-10**]:
COMMENTS:     1. Initial angiography of the aortic arch was
obtained
revealing a type 1 aortic arch without critical stenosis atthe
level of
the arch. Images were ovbtained non-selectively via a 5 french
tennis
racquet catheter. Selective images were then obtained of the
right and
then the left carotid arteries with a 5fr [**Doctor Last Name **] 1 catheter.
The right
common carotid: minimal disease, right ICA has a 65% lesion
proximally
just distal to the CCA bulb. The right ICA fills the ipsilateral
AC and
MCA intracerebrally with cross-filling noted of the
contralateral ACA.
The Left common carotid artery is normal. The Left ICA has a
tubular 80%
stenosis present involving the bulb and extending into the
proximal left
ica. The ICA fills the ipsilateral ACA and MCA as well as
providing some
cross-filling to the contralateral ACA.
2. Successful ptca and stenting of the left ICA utilizing spider
filter
for distal protection. Successful deployment of a self-expanding

tapering 6-8x40mm protege carotid stent which was post dilated
to 4.5mm.
Final angiography revealed a 10% residual stenosis, no
angiographically
apparent dissection and brisk flow (see ptca comments). The
patient left
the lab free of angina and in stable condition.
3. Limited hemodynamics revealed a central aortic pressure of
196/69.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Left internal carotd disease


Brief Hospital Course:
#Carotid Stenosis: Pt with Carotid stenosis found on screening
US. Relatively high risk of stroke based on the degree of
stenosis. She was evaluated by cardiovascular medicine and
underwent cath on [**2178-2-10**]. Angiography demonstrated: right
common carotid: minimal disease, right ICA has a 65% lesion
proximally
just distal to the CCA bulb. The Left common carotid artery is
normal. The Left ICA has a tubular 80% stenosis present
involving the bulb and extending into the proximal left ica. The
ICA fills the ipsilateral ACA and MCA as well as providing some
cross-filling to the contralateral ACA. Left ICA was successful
ptca and stented utilizing spider filter for distal protection.
Final angiography revealed a 10% residual stenosis, no
angiographically apparent dissection and brisk flow. The patient
was observed in CCU overnight. Required phenyleprine to maintain
BP systolic range 100-140. Normal neuro exam post stenting. Her
PCM backup rate was increased from 40bpm to 50bpm givnen her
symptomatic bradycardia. Her pressor was weaned the morning
following admission. Her digoxin, amlodipine, lisnopril, lasix
and imdur were discontinued until her scheduled outpatient
follow up with cardiology. Her carvedilol was held pre-cath and
she was instructed to restart this medication on the day
following discharge.
.
#Bradycardia/Mobitz 1: The Mobitz 1 heart block is new since her
last admission and she descibes increased fatigue. The AV block
with slightly sccoped ST segments and new fatigue all suggest
possible digoxin toxicity. Her digoxin level was elevated and
her medication was held. Her carvedilol was held pre-cath and
she was instructed to restart her home dose on the day following
discharge. Concern because mobitz [**6-4**] worsen with vagal
stimulation (and carotid stents frequently complicated by high
vagal tone so her PCM backup rate was increased to 50bpm as
above.
.
#. CAD: Cardiac cath on [**1-17**] showed stable coronary anatomy
with known RCA occlusion supplied by collaterals. No other
significant coronary disease. She was continued on aspirin and
plavix. Continued on statin. Her lisinopril, amlodipine, and
imdur were held as above.
.
#. Chronic Kidney Disease: Baseline Cr. of 1.7. Estimated GFR of
approximately 30. The patient received pre-cath hydration with
NS at 60cc/hr ON, more gentle given decrease
