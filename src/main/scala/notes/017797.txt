.
ECG ([**11-20**]): Sinus rhythm with frequent atrial premature beats.
Left axis deviation with left anterior fascicular block.
Prominent early R wave progression with ST-T wave abnormalities
in the anterior leads. Consider myocardial ischemia versus right
ventricular overload. Clinical correlation is suggested. No
previous tracing available for comparison.
.
BILATERAL LOWER EXTREMITY ULTRASOUND ([**11-20**]):  [**Doctor Last Name **]-scale,
color, and spectral Doppler analysis of the right and left
common femoral, superficial femoral, and popliteal veins was
performed.  There is no evidence of right lower extremity DVT.
There is nonocclusive thrombus extending from the left common
femoral vein to the proximal portion of the left superficial
femoral vein.  The mid and distal superficial femoral veins on
the left showed no evidence of thrombus.
IMPRESSION:  Nonocclusive thrombus extending from the left
common femoral vein to the proximal portion of the left
superficial femoral vein.  No evidence of right lower extremity
DVT.
.
TTE ([**11-21**]):
1. The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial septal defect or
patent
foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast
with maneuvers.
A small pulmonary AV shunt is probably present.
2. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. There is severe
global left  ventricular hypokinesis. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is severely depressed.
3. The right ventricular cavity is dilated. There is severe
global right
ventricular free wall hypokinesis.
4. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. Mild (1+)
aortic
regurgitation is seen.
5. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial
mitral
regurgitation is seen.
6. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
7. There is a small, loculated (apical) pericardial effusion
with fibrin
deposits on the surface of the heart..
.
CT abdomen/pelvis with contrast ([**11-21**]):
1.  Very large bowel-containing right inguinal/scrotal hernia
without evidence of obstruction or ischemia.
2.  Thickening of the bladder wall with possible intraluminal
blood clots.
3.  Small bilateral pleural effusions and pericardial effusion.
4.  No intraabdominal mass or lymphadenopathy.
.
BLADDER ULTRASOUND STUDY ([**11-24**]):  Numerous images of the bladder
demonstrate a diffusely abnormal wall with irregular thickness
and contour, predominantly on the anterior aspect. Some areas of
the irregularly thickened anterior wall demonstrate increased
vascularity. There is echogenic fluid in the bladder with debris
seen in the dependent portion, some of which is mobile.
IMPRESSION:  Irregularly thickened bladder wall, most pronounced
anteriorly with small areas of increased vascularity.  Given the
appearance of the wall, a cystoscopy is recommended to exclude
malignancy.
