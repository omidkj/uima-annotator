History of Present Illness:
This is a 76 year old man with chronic atrial fibrillation and
recently diagnosed cardiomyopathy (EF 25%). He presented this
admission for scheduled catheterization.

He initially presented in [**3-/2161**] with fatigue and dys[pnea. He
denies any history of chest pain. Echocardiography in [**Month (only) 547**]
showed severe systolic dysfunction with an EF of 20-25%. He was
seen by cardiology who started him on Lasix. He then underwent
Adenosine stress perfusion imaging [**2161-6-22**] which showed a
medium defect of moderate intensity in the mid-inferolateral,
apical - lateral, apical-inferior  walls with mild partial
reversibility at rest. There was a small defect of mild-moderate
intensity in the apical anterior, apical-septal and true apical
walls with minimal reversibility at rest. He was then scheduled
for elective catheterization.

Brief Hospital Course:
Cardiac catheterization revealed triple vessel disease. Cardiac
surgical consultation was obtained for revascularization. The
usual preopeartive workup was undertaken.

On [**7-27**] he was taken to the Operating Room where quadruple
bypass grafting was performed. An intraaortic balloon pump was
placed to augment hemodynamics given his severely impaired left
ventricle.  Milrinone and Levophed were given to achieve
adequate hemodynamics. He was taken to the intensive care unit.
He subsequently had a rising lactate and TEE revealed LV
hypokinesis with overdistention. A Lasix infusion was started
with good results and the balloon pump was removed due to leg
ischemia the next morning.  He stabilized and was extubated on
POD 3. Pressors were gradually weaned. He was anticoagulated for
his chronic atrial fibrillation. On postoperative day five he
was transferred to the step down unit for further recovery.
Diuresis was continued. The physical therapy service was
consulted for assistance with his postoperative strength and
mobility. He was noticed to have jaundice and a total bilirubin
was elevated. A GI consult was obtained and a liver/gallbladder
ultrasound was recommended.  This study showed no obstructions
or gallstones. His total bilirubin trended downward over a week
from a high of 13.  On the day of discharge his total bilirubin
rose again to 6 from 3 and on the recommendation of the liver
team another ultrasound was obtained which was again
unremarkable.  He was advised to follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 7033**] with
hepatology as an out-patient.  Duoderm dressiongs were placed
for a stage 2 ulcer. Levofloxacin was started for a urinary
tract infection. Given his low ejection fraction, coreg was
increased as tolerated and an ace inhibitor was started. Mr.
[**Known lastname 805**] continued to make steady progress and was disharged to
[**Hospital3 **] of [**2161-8-6**].
