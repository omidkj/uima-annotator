HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 85-year-old white
male who has history of aortic stenosis and a recent
echocardiogram has been notable for progression in its
severity.  Over the past several months, the patient states
that he had some episodes of presyncope with a systolic blood
pressure noted in the 100s.  His blood pressure medication
was decreased and he has had no further episodes.  An
echocardiogram on [**2163-2-9**] revealed an ejection
fraction of 60% and a aortic valve area appearing thickened
with restrictive motion, mild aortic insufficiency, a peak
gradient of 70 mm with an aortic valve area of 0.87 squared.
There was Mitral annular calcification and trace mitral
regurgitation.  He had pulmonary hypertension with a noted PA
systolic of approximately 40 mmHg.  He also had carotid
ultrasound studies which revealed a widely patent right
carotid and a 50-60% stenosis in the left carotid.

He underwent cardiac catheterization on [**3-22**] which
revealed normal coronaries and severe aortic stenosis with a
mean gradient of 34 mmHg and a valve area of 0.8 cm squared.
He is now admitted for elective aortic valve replacement.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  History of aortic stenosis.
2.  History of hypertension.
3.  History of peripheral vascular disease.
4.  History of chronic renal insufficiency.
5.  He is hard of hearing.
6.  Status post right CEA.
7.  Status post left hand trauma 50 years ago.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1.  Hydrochlorothiazide.
2.  Triamterene 25/37.5 mg po q.d.
3.  Metoprolol 50 mg po b.i.d.
4.  Norvasc 5 mg po q.d.
5.  Aspirin 81 mg po q.d.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  He does not drink alcohol or smoke
cigarettes.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Unremarkable.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  He is a well-developed, well-nourished
elderly white male in no apparent distress.  Vital signs
stable.  Afebrile.  Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat exam:
Normocephalic, atraumatic.  Extraocular movements intact.
Oropharynx benign.  Neck was supple, full range of motion, no
lymphadenopathy or thyromegaly.  Well-healed surgical scar on
the right.  Chest was clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Cardiovascular exam:  Regular rate and rhythm with a systolic
ejection murmur.  Abdomen was soft, nontender with positive
bowel sounds, no masses or hepatosplenomegaly.  Extremities
were without cyanosis, clubbing or edema.  Neurological exam
was nonfocal.

On [**3-28**], he underwent an aortic valve replacement with a
23 mm [**Last Name (un) 3843**]-[**Doctor First Name 7624**] pericardial valve.  Cross clamp
time was 66 minutes.  Total bypass time 89 minutes.  He was
transferred to the Cardiac Surgery Recovery Unit on neo and
propofol.  He had a stable postoperative night.  He was
extubated.  Following extubation, he had some garbled speech
and nonsense speaking.  He was seen by Neurology who ordered
a head CT which was unremarkable.  On postoperative day two,
he had his chest tubes discontinued.  He also had his wires
discontinued and he had an MRI which revealed a pinpoint
question of a clinically insignificant CVA versus artifact.
His dysarthria resolved, and his confusion resolved.  He did
require aggressive respiratory therapy and continued to
progress and on postoperative day number four was transferred
to the floor in stable condition.  Neurology felt that his
mental status changes were due to sedation and narcotics.  He
continued to progress and was ready for discharge on
postoperative day number seven, but had a five beat run of
ventricular tachycardia on the morning of postoperative day
number seven and received magnesium for that and was observed
for 24 hours.  He had no further ectopy and was discharged to
rehabilitation on postoperative day number eight in stable
condition.

His laboratories on discharge:  White blood cell count
10,300, hematocrit 30.1, platelet count 407,000.  Sodium 143,
potassium 4.3, chloride 109, CO2 27, BUN 29, creatinine 1.4,
blood sugar 107.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
1.  Colace 100 mg po b.i.d.
2.  Aspirin 325 mg po q.d.
3.  Flovent 110 mg 2 puffs b.i.d.
4.  Combivent 2 puffs q.i.d.
5.  Triamterene.
6.  Hydrochlorothiazide 37.5/25 po q.d.
7.  Lopressor 100 mg po b.i.d.
8.  Tylenol [**1-28**] po q. 4-6 hours prn pain.

weeks and Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] in four weeks.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:

2.  Postoperative mental status changes.
3.  Hypertension.
4.  Chronic renal insufficiency.
