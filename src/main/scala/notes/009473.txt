History of Present Illness:
Per Dr.[**Initials (NamePattern4) 1369**] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] note:  64-year-

liver disease secondary to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis and
end-stage renal disease. She has recently been found to have
a stenosis of the hepatic artery distal to the anastomosis
just near the bifurcation of the right and left hepatic
arteries. She underwent attempted angioplasty and stenting
that was unsuccessful on 2 occasions. Therefore, she has
provided informed consent for operative exploration and
repair of the hepatic artery stenosis with a saphenous vein
interposition graft.

Brief Hospital Course:
On [**2154-3-14**], she underwent saphenous vein interposition graft
repair of hepatic artery; harvesting of left saphenous vein
graft for hepatic artery stenosis, status
post liver transplant. Surgeon was [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **] [**Initial (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. Please
refer to operative note for complete details.

Postop, she did well. LFTs increased initially. On [**3-15**], a duplex
to assess the hepatic artery demonstrated more normal
intrahepatic left and right arterial flow. However, there was
persistent high velocities seen within the extrahepatic artery
where it made a tight loop. Subsequent LFTs trended down.
Hematocrit drifted down to 23.6 on postop day 3. She was
transfused with 2 units of PRBC. Repeat duplex on [**3-18**] noted
persistent elevated velocity in the extrahepatic main hepatic
artery. LFTs continued to trend down with the exception of the
alk phos which remained in the 360-390 range. Prograf levels
were therapeutic. Dose was adjusted.

Heparin was held postop as she was coagulopathic with INR as
high as 3.8. Coumadin was started on [**3-16**]. INR was therapeutic.
Hct trended down again to 24 and another 2 units of PRBC were
transfused with hct increase to 30. Subsequent hcts were stable.
Vital signs were stable. She received lasix daily for
generalized edema. Renal function was stable.

Psychiatry was consulted on [**3-22**] for suicidal ideation.
Recommendations included stopping Remeron which caused the
patient to have visual hallucinations. A 1:1 sitter was used. On
[**3-25**], psychiatry felt that the 1:1 sitter was no longer needed
and that the patient would be safe for discharge to home with
outpatient followup with her psychiatrist as well as attendence
at a Day Psychiatry Program. Social Work was involved and
assisted to make arrangements.

Of note, she complained of right lower quadrant pain. On [**3-20**],
an abdominal CT noted patent hepatic artery, hepatic and portal
veins. New areas of hypodensities along the anterior margin of
liver and within the medial left lobe. There was a subcentimeter
hypodensity along the inferior liver margin is too small to
characterize. A large hematoma was seen along the inferior
margin of liver with adjacent fascial thickening and fat
stranding. Unchanged splenic vein thrombosis. Interval increased
anasarca and unchanged omental infarct.

She also experienced significant sacral pain. The area appeared
wnl. L-S spine films showed generalized demineralization, but no
evidence of compression fracture. There was minimal hypertrophic
spurring with the vertebrae and intervertebral disc spaces well
maintained. A pelvic CT was done revealing no intrapelvic
collection, right lower quadrant renal transplant with
surrounding inflammatory stranding and air within the collecting
system, extensive body wall edema, predominantly along the right
lower quadrant, superficial to the right lower quadrant renal
transplant, and no suspicious osseous abnormalities.

PT worked with her declaring her safe to return to her [**Hospital 4382**] facility using a walker.
