Admission Date:  [**2197-9-8**]     Discharge Date:  [**2197-9-21**]

Date of Birth:   [**2135-2-23**]     Sex:  M

Service:  CT Surgery

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient was referred in by
Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 8173**], who evaluated him on the day of
admission for symptoms with congestive heart failure.  In
early [**Month (only) 216**], he started to feel, as he stated, lousy.  He
became short of breath, which became progressively worse.  He
sleeps on two pillows and describes paroxysmal nocturnal
dyspnea.  He had some increased abdominal girth.

The patient was admitted to the hospital about one week ago
for 24 hours and only received some intravenous Lasix.  He
did not have any testing at that time.  He has never had any
chest pressure and denies a history of prior myocardial
infarction.  He also denies dizziness, lightheadedness or
syncope.  He has had hypertension and was a smoker but quit
five years ago.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Paxil 30 mg p.o.q.d., oxazepam 15
mg p.o.q.d., Univasc 15 mg p.o.q.d., Lasix 40 mg p.o.q.d.,
insulin, Pravachol 20 mg p.o.q.d., aspirin, Centrum Silver,
vitamin E and garlic.

ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On physical examination, the patient
appeared to be in moderate respiratory distress.  His weight
was 238 pounds.  He had a good blood pressure at 110/80 but
his pulse was 120 beats per minute.  Jugular venous pressure
could not be assessed.  He had 1+ carotids bilaterally.  On
chest examination, there were bibasilar rales.  On cardiac
examination, apical impulse was diffuse, heart sounds were
normal, there was a loud summation gallop.  Abdomen was
distended.  There was peripheral edema of the right leg to
the mid-calf level.  Pulses were not easily palpable.

LABORATORY DATA:  Electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia
and left bundle branch block.  Echocardiogram showed an
enlarged left atrium, dilated left ventricle with a left
ventricular ejection fraction of less than 20%.  The right
ventricle was also hypokinetic.  There was moderate pulmonary
hypertension.

On the day of admission, hematocrit was 38.1, white blood
cell count 9.6, platelet count 337,000, prothrombin time
19.2, INR 2.4, blood sugar 166, BUN 27, creatinine 1.1,
sodium 132 and chloride 94.

IMPRESSION ON ADMISSION:  Dr.[**Name (NI) 31768**] impression was
that the patient was in congestive heart failure and she
admitted him to the hospital.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1.  Insulin dependent diabetes
mellitus.  2.  Congestive heart failure.  3.  Peripheral
vascular disease, status post right femoral-popliteal bypass,
status post left femoral-popliteal bypass and status post
below the knee amputation in [**2196-2-17**].  4.  Hypertension.
5.  Anxiety.

ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and
was seen by cardiology for his episodes of nonsustained
ventricular tachycardia and ventricular bigeminy.  He ruled
out for a myocardial infarction by CKs, but the plan was to
take him for a cardiac catheterization when he was more
stable and had been diuresed significantly.  He was followed
by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 8173**] with a left below the knee amputation and
he was followed by cardiology and case management, as was
diuresed for his congestive heart failure.  He continued on
aspirin and Univasc and remained on the cardiology floor.

On [**2197-9-12**], the patient underwent a cardiac
catheterization and was referred to cardiothoracic surgery
for evaluation.  On [**2197-9-12**], his white blood cell
count was 8.2 with a hematocrit of 38.7, platelet count
288,000, prothrombin time 15.4, partial thromboplastin time
28.7, INR 1.6, sodium 132, potassium 4.1, chloride 93,
bicarbonate 29, BUN 41, creatinine 1.4, and blood sugar 163.

The patient was examined again by cardiothoracic surgery.  He
had had an intra-aortic balloon pump placed in the
catheterization laboratory in his right femoral artery.  His
right foot was warm and perfused.  He is status post left
lower leg amputation.  He was seen by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 10102**] of cardiac
surgery, who again examined, and also noted venous stasis
changes of his right leg.  He also noted a thick panniculus
on his obese abdomen but no hepatosplenomegaly or masses
detected.  A Foley catheter was in place.  He had questions
about conduit availability in the right leg and recommended
that vein mapping be done.  He also noted that the left hand
had an intact palmar arch on examination of the left radial
artery, the patient is left handed, but there was a question
of the intactness of his right palmar arch, as decisions for
conduits needed to be made.

Cardiac catheterization on [**2197-9-14**]:  Left
ventricular ejection fraction not calculated as no
ventriculogram was done; left main had a 50% lesion, left
anterior descending artery had a 90% lesion; circumflex 100%
lesion and right coronary artery 100% occluded. Index was
only 1.7 at the time of examination, with pulmonary artery
pressure of 57/34.  Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 10102**] recommended right leg vein
mapping and getting a transthoracic echocardiogram to
evaluate for mitral regurgitation and left ventricular
ejection fraction, and agreed to re-evaluate the patient when
the studies were done.

The patient remained in the Coronary Care Unit with an
intra-aortic balloon pump, with a tentative plan to go to the
Operating Room on [**Last Name (LF) 2974**], [**2197-9-15**].  He continued
to have occasional premature ventricular contractions on
telemetry.  His magnesium was repleted.  He continued his
diuresis.  Vein mapping showed below the knee lesser
saphenous and greater saphenous to be patent.  Echocardiogram
showed a left ventricular ejection fraction of less than 15%
with left ventricular dilatation, 2+ mitral regurgitation, 2+
tricuspid regurgitation, right ventricle with also dilated
and depressed function.

Diagnosis of severe ischemic cardiomyopathy was made.  The
patient was also started on a beta blocker and ACE inhibitors
were continued, as well as aspirin and the heparin drip.  He
continued diuresis.  Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 10102**] again explained the risks
to the patient, who consented to surgery.  He was also seen
by case management for placement issues postoperatively.

On [**2197-9-15**], the patient underwent coronary artery
bypass grafting times three with a left internal mammary
artery to the left anterior descending artery, saphenous vein
graft to obtuse marginal and saphenous vein graft to
posterior descending artery.

The patient was transferred to the Cardiothoracic Intensive
Care Unit on milrinone and Levophed as well as continued
mechanical support with his intra-aortic balloon pump that
had been placed preoperatively.  Of note, his saphenous vein
grafts were obtained from the lesser saphenous area as well
as distal greater saphenous, distal to the femoral-poplitea
graft in the left lower extremity due to his prior peripheral
vascular surgery.  Please refer to the operative note in the
chart.  Of note, the patient had been transferred to the
Intensive Care Unit on the following additional medications:
Epinephrine drip, amiodarone drip and propofol.

On postoperative day number one, Amicar and epinephrine drips
were off.  The patient had received 14 units of fresh frozen
plasma, ten units of packed red blood cells, one unit of
cryoprecipitate and four units platelets for continuing
bleeding postoperatively.  He was on an amiodarone drip at 1,
insulin at 12, Levophed at 0.24, milrinone 0.375, propofol 25
and cisatracurium at 1.  He was up 13.9 liters in fluid.  He
had put 4.9 liters out from his chest tubes.

The patient remained paralyzed, with bilateral rhonchi.  His
white blood cell count was 6.2, hematocrit 27, potassium 4.2,
BUN 35, creatinine 1.6, blood sugar 236 and INR 1.5.  He was
kept sedated with orders to continue transfusing him to a
platelet count of about 100,000.  He was on levofloxacin and
vancomycin for perioperative antibiotics.

The patient was returned to the Operating Room for
postoperative bleeding
