Service:  NEUROSURGERY

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 60-year-old
right-handed gentleman, with a sudden onset of severe
headache on the 20th of this month.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Coronary stent in [**2191**].
2. Gastric ulcer.
3. Borderline diabetes.
4. Hypertension.
5. A question of a closed head injury in the past.
6. Hiatal hernia and inguinal hernia status post repairs.
7. Gout.

ALLERGIES:  Morphine.

The patient was previously healthy, who had a sudden onset of
the worst headache of his life that persisted throughout the
day.  He finally went to the Emergency Room, and a head CT
showed diffuse subarachnoid hemorrhage.  He was transferred
to [**Hospital6 256**] for further
management.

PHYSICAL EXAM ON ARRIVAL:  He was awake, alert, oriented x 3.
His cranial nerves were intact.  His pupils were equal, round
and reactive to light.  His visual fields were full.  His
EOMS full.  Face was symmetric.  His tongue was midline.
Palate rose symmetrically.  Motor strength was [**6-4**] in all
muscle groups.  He had no drift.  His sensation was intact.
His proprioception was intact.  His reflexes were 1+
throughout.  He had no clonus.

Head CT showed hemorrhage in the region of the circle of
[**Location (un) 431**] with no evidence of an aneurysm.  The patient was
admitted to the Neuro SICU.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  He had an arteriogram on [**2200-4-20**] which
showed a question of a very small A-COM aneurysm actually too
small to have any treatment done to it.  The patient also
developed acute onset of an episode of chest pain with no EKG
changes.  Cardiac enzymes were negative.  Cardiology was
consulted, and they continued to follow him, making
recommendations for continuing beta blocker for rate control.

The patient, on [**2200-4-20**], had a chest x-ray after an
episode of shortness of breath.  Chest x-ray confirmed CHF.
The patient was given lasix.  Cardiology was reconsulted, and
an echo was suggested which was done.  Preliminary results
shows a normal EF.  EKG has no evidence of ischemia.
Recommended starting valsartan, continuing diuresing.  He
remained neurologically stable, awake, alert and oriented x
3.  EOMS full.  Face symmetric.  No drift.  Strength was [**6-4**]
in all muscle groups.

He had a head CT on [**4-23**] that showed partial resolution of
the subarachnoid hemorrhage with no hydrocephalus or midline
shift.  Chest x-ray on the 24 showed slight improvement of
his CHF.  Final results of his echo showed an EF of 55% with
mild AR and mild to moderate MR.

On [**2200-4-26**], the patient was taken back for a repeat angio
which showed no evidence of previously thought A-COM
aneurysm, although the patient required intubation for the
procedure.  He was extubated on [**2200-4-28**] and remained
extubated.  He continued to be followed by cardiology who was
recommending an outpatient stress test, and increase his
valsartan to 320 po qd.  Respiratory wise he remained stable.
Neurologically was stable.

He also spiked a fever during his ICU stay and was found to
have a strep bacteria likely secondary to his A-line.  He was
started on vancomycin and continues on that currently, and
will finish a 2-week course after first a negative blood
culture, which will be the [**4-27**], and he was followed
by the ID service.  He had a TEE which ruled out
endocarditis.

On [**2200-5-1**], the patient had a PICC line placed and is
ready for discharge on [**2200-5-2**] with 2 weeks of vancomycin
IV for strep bacteria.  His neurologic status is stable and
intact.  Awake, alert and oriented x 3.  Moving all
extremities with 5/5 strength.  He still has persistent
headaches and receiving narcotic medication for that.  He was
seen by physical therapy and occupational therapy and found
to be safe for discharge to home on [**2200-5-2**] with follow-up
with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1132**] in 2 weeks.

CONDITION:  Stable.

FOLLOW-UP:  With Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1132**] in 2 weeks.
