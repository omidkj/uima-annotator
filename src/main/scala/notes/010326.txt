Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 148**]
Chief Complaint:
Jaundice.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2187-8-22**]:
1. Pylorus-preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy.
2. Open cholecystectomy.
3. Staging laparoscopy.
[**2187-8-23**]:
1. Reopening of recent laparotomy and control of intra-abdominal
bleeding.


History of Present Illness:
This very nice 59-year-old woman recently became jaundiced.  A
workup ensued and found her to have biliary obstruction on
account of a mass in the head of her pancreas.  This mass was
ultimately visualized by CAT scan and seemed to be a resectable
lesion.  It was finally analyzed by endoscopic ultrasound and a
biopsy of this proved adenocarcinoma. The patient has been
informed of the diagnosis. She was admitted for planned Whipple
surgery.


Past Medical History:
Her medical history is significant for hypercholesterolemia,
sleep apnea, asthma, overactive bladder, arthritis, gout, HTN,
borderline hypothyroidism, obesity, and mild GERD.

Her surgical history is significant for hysterectomy in [**2178**] as
well as a left knee arthroscopy in [**2183**].  She has had two
pilonidal cyst operations, tonsillectomy, and adenoidectomy in
the distant past.  Her GI procedures include the aforementioned
ERCP and EUS and she is currently stented.

Imaging:
[**2187-8-22**] Abdominal x-ray:
FINDINGS: Study is suboptimal secondary to patient body habitus
and patient motion. Nasogastric tube is seen extending into the
expected location of the stomach. There is a line.catheter
extending along the the right abdomen to the level of the T11
vertebral body. A horizontal line of surgical staples is seen
extending across the abdomen. Horizontal linear density in the
left upper quadrant is felt to most likely be artifactual.
Otherwise, no definite evidence of a radiopaque needle or other
surgical foreign body. Surgical staples also noted overlying the
upper left pelvis.
.
[**2187-8-22**] CXR:
Elevation of the right hemidiaphragm may be due to right lower
lobe atelectasis, common postoperative finding. Upper lungs are
clear. Pleural effusion is minimal if any. No pneumothorax.
Normal cardiomediastinal silhouette. Right jugular line tip
projects over the low SVC and a nasogastric tube passes into the
stomach.
.

Gross:

The specimen is received fresh in four parts, each labeled with
the patient's name, "[**Known lastname 60542**], [**Known firstname **]" and the medical record
number.

Part 1 is additionally labeled "gallbladder." It consists of a
gallbladder measuring 12.0 x 2.7 x 2.3 cm. The gallbladder is
opened to reveal velvety pink mucosa.  There are no stones and
approximately 10 cc of residual, green sludgy bile.   Part 1 is
represented in cassette A.

Part 2 is additionally labeled "Whipple's node." It consists of
a lymph node, measuring 2.3 1.7 x 0.5 cm.  The lymph node is
bisected and submitted entirely in B-C.

Part 3 is additionally labeled "jejunum." It consists of a
segment of jejunum measuring 14.5 cm in length and 5.8 cm in
circumference. The serosal surface is smooth and shiny. The
resection margins are stapled.  The bowel is opened to reveal
unremarkable tan and pink mucosa.  The resection margins are
submitted in cassette D.

Part 4 is additionally labeled "Whipple." It consists of a
pancreaticoduodenectomy specimen that measures 12.8 x 5.2 x 4.5
cm in overall dimension. The pancreatic portion is composed of
the head and measures 5.2 x 4.5 x 2.6 cm.  The duodenal segment
measures 12.8 cm in length and 6.4 cm in circumference.  Both
proximal and distal resection margins are stapled with staple
lines at each measuring 4.5 cm. It is oriented by the surgeon
with a black silk suture indicating bile duct, a blue suture
indicating the pancreatic neck margin and a green suture
indicating the superior mesenteric artery. The posterior
retroperitoneal margin is identified and is inked [**Location (un) 2452**].  The
pancreatic parenchymal margin is inked in blue. The uncinate
margin is inked black. The duodenum is opened to reveal a
prominent fold, 1.2 cm from the proximal  resection margin. The
bile duct segment measures 8.5 cm from ampulla to the distal
end. A segment of the cystic duct is present and joins the
common bile duct.  The bile duct is patent. The bile duct is
opened to reveal unremarkable mucosa. The pancreas is serially
sliced to reveal a tumor that measures 2.5 x 1.8 x 1.6 cm and
that lies 0.5 cm from the posterior retroperitoneal margin.  The
uninvolved pancreatic parenchyma is unremarkable.  The
peripancreatic adipose tissue is dissected to reveal several
potential lymph nodes.   I
