or edema.  He has had anginal chest pain which is similar to
his presenting complaint, but without radiations to his back.
At outside hospital, electrocardiogram showed split Ts in the
inferior and lateral leads with progression to ST elevations
in V1 through V5.  He was given nitroglycerin, Lasix and
morphine and his chest pain resolved.  He had a troponin 1 of
1.75, CPK of 304 and he was transferred to [**Hospital6 1760**] for emergent cardiac
catheterization. Cath lab hemodynamics showed RA 5, RV 31/4, PA
31/15, PCWP 16; Angiography showed LM without significant
disease, LAD 90% proximal  99% mid stenosis; Left
circumflex mid total occlusion before large OM, RCA total
occlusion distal with bridging and left to right collaterals. He
had successful angioplasty and stent of LAD and CX.

Electrocardiogram at 1:23 a.m. was normal sinus rhythm at
101, normal axis deviation, 2 to [**Street Address(2) 1755**] elevation V1 to V5,
Q V3, AVF.

LABS AT [**Hospital6 **] AT 8 A.M.:  CBC

index was 7.7.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  In summary, the patient is a 48-year-old
man with coronary artery disease, past myocardial infarction,
hypertension, diabetes mellitus who presented with acute
myocardial infarction and went for catheter.  LAD and
L-circumflex were stented successfully.  IABP was placed.

1.  CARDIOVASCULAR:  Coronary artery disease:  Three vessel
disease with successful intervention on LAD and left
circumflex, but RCA not done secondary to good collateral.
The patient was continued on aspirin 325 qd.  Plavix was
started with 300 mg bolus and continued at 75 mg, will
continue for 30 days.  Metoprolol was titrated up.  The
patient was discontinued on atenolol 25 mg po qd.  Captopril
was initially started and the patient was changed to
lisinopril 2.5 qd.  He tolerated this regimen well.
Intra-aortic balloon pump was discontinued without

Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in one week, 5 mg po q hs for two days and
patient was discontinued with follow up in clinic.

Rhythm:  The patient was monitored on telemetry.  Rate and
rhythm remained normal.

2.  PULMONARY:  Lungs clear.  His O2 saturations were good.

3.  RENAL:  Creatinine remained stable.  Electrolytes were
checked and repleted prn

4.  INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  White blood cells increased to 13.5,
but then decreased back down to 11.0, leukocytosis likely
secondary to acute myocardial infarction.  The patient
