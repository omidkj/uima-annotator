Pertinent Results:
[**2100-7-5**] Upper GI Study
IMPRESSION:  Prominent-appearing gastric fundus with leak along
the inferior
edge.  The gastric sleeve portion is patent.  A followup CT
examination can be
performed to assess for leakage of administered contrast.

[**2100-7-6**] CT Abd/Pelv c Contrast
IMPRESSION:
1.  Complex fluid and gas collections in the surgical bed and
splenic hilum,
most compatible with abscess.  There is also dependent complex
fluid in the
pelvis likely related to the post surgical state although
infection cannot be
excluded.
2. A filling defect is seen within a left lower lobe pulmonary
artery
centrally, highly concerning for a PE. As this study is not
adequate for
assessment of pulmonary embolism, a dedicated pulmonary embolism
study can be
obtained if required.

[**2100-7-6**] CT Guided Needle Placement
IMPRESSION: 1. Uneventful percutaneous abscess drainage of a
perigastric fluid
collection.  8 French [**Last Name (un) 2823**] catheter in place. Complete
resolution of fluid
collection anterior to the stomach, small residual fluid
collection in the
splenic hilum, it was recommended that the patient lie on her
right side to
facilitate drainage of the residual fluid through the catheter.

[**2100-7-9**] CT Guided Procedure

IMPRESSION:
Successful placement of percutaneous drainage catheter placement
into the
right lower quadrant abscess. 10 cc of fluid was sent for
microbiology.

   FLUID CULTURE (Final [**2100-7-17**]):
      This culture contains mixed bacterial types (>=3) so an
abbreviated
      workup is performed. Any growth of P.aeruginosa, S.aureus
and beta
      hemolytic streptococci will be reported. IF THESE BACTERIA
ARE NOT
      REPORTED BELOW, THEY ARE NOT PRESENT in this culture..
      Work-up of organism(s) listed below discontinued (excepted
screened
      organisms) due to the presence of mixed bacterial flora
detected
      after further incubation.
      YEAST.    MODERATE GROWTH.
      STAPHYLOCOCCUS, COAGULASE NEGATIVE.    SPARSE GROWTH.
      VIRIDANS STREPTOCOCCI.    MODERATE GROWTH.

   ANAEROBIC CULTURE (Final [**2100-7-17**]):    NO ANAEROBES ISOLATED.


   ACID FAST SMEAR (Final [**2100-7-14**]):
      NO ACID FAST BACILLI SEEN ON CONCENTRATED SMEAR.

   ACID FAST CULTURE (Preliminary):    NO MYCOBACTERIA ISOLATED.


[**2100-7-26**]: CT cath change: IMPRESSION:
1.  Epigastric drain in appropriate position with demonstration
of gastric
anastomotic leak.  The drain was repaired and was functioning
well after the procedure.
2.  Right lower quadrant drain sits at the periphery of a 3.5 x
5.0 cm fluid collection.  Small subhepatic fluid collection is
likely too small to drain.
3.  Small left pleural effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient presented to [**Hospital1 69**] on
[**2100-7-5**] complaining of fatigue, anxiety, and anorexia. In the
ED, the patient was made NPO and sent for an upper GI study,
which showed a leak in her recent sleeve gastrectomy ([**2100-6-28**]).
She was admitted to the SICU for closer monitoring. On HD10, she
was transferred to a regular hospital floor (West 2b) due to her
improving status.

Neuro: The patient was alert and oriented throughout
hospitalization; pain was initially managed with
CV: The patient remained stable from a cardiovascular
standpoint; vital signs were routinely monitored.
Pulmonary: The patient remained stable from a pulmonary
standpoint; vital signs were routinely monitored. A left lower
lobe pulmonary artery embolism was noted incidentally on CT scan
and therapeutic anticoagulation was started. The patient was
maintained on therapeutic heparin with goal PTT of 60-80
throughout her hospital stay. She was transitioned to Lovenox
120mg Q12h at discharge.
GI/GU/FEN: The patient was initially kept NPO until a final read
of her upper GI study was performed on HD1.  On HD1 a leak was
discovered on the patient's UGI and an NGT was placed. CT
revealed complex fluid and gas collections compatible with an
abscess as well as dependent complex fluid in the pelvis. An IR
drain was then placed to drain the abdominal abscess on HD1 with
improvement in symptoms of abdominal pain and distention per the
patient. The patient reported increasing lower abdominal/pelvic
pain over the ensuing days and on HD4 another IR drain was
placed in the pelvis with improvement of symptoms and drainage
of fluid. On HD8, IR replaced the dislodged RLQ percutaneous
drain of the RLQ abscess with improvement in drainage and
abscess size. Also on HD8, IR aspirated the anterior midline
antraabdominal fluid collection with complete resolution on
post-procedure images. On the day prior to discharge, IR
replaced the epigastric drain with improvement in fluid
collection size. The patient was admitted with an elevated
creatinine of 1.3. Her creatinine continued to rise and returned
to 1.1 by HD9, 0.9 by HD11, and back to baseline of 0.6 on
discharge.
ID: The patient arrived with an elevated white count of 12.1,
which peaked at 28.5 on HD7, after which it trended down to 12.8
on discharge. The patient was started on
cipro/flagyl/fluconazole on HD1. Micro was unable to obtain
sensitivities due to high mixed bacteria burden of her initial
cultures. On HD 6 the patient was switched to
cefepime/vancomycin/flagyl/fluconazole. Fluconazole was replaced
by Micafungin on HD9. On HD18, she was placed back on
fluconazole from micagfungin. On discharge, h
