Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2736**]
Chief Complaint:
Respiratory distress

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
intubation and mechanical ventilation

History of Present Illness:
62-year-old Cape-Verdian female with history of atrial
fibrillation, PE on coumadin, and diastolic CHF (EF 50% on TTE
on [**2127-4-22**]) with recent CCU admit for CHF exacerbation requiring
intubation admitted to the CCU with respiratory distress under
similar circumstances.

Per records the patient was discharged on [**2127-4-25**]. She had been
admitted with a similar presentation to today with respiratory
distress and flash pulmonary edema in the setting of
hypertensive emergency. On that admission she was diuresed with
lasix 150mg IV X 2 and extubated to 4L O2 by NC within one
afternoon. Her medications were titrated as follows: Clonidine
was weaned and she continued the wean at home, metoprolol was
changed to labetolol, lasix was increased from 80 to 100mg [**Hospital1 **].
Discharge weight: 132.3 kg.
Per the daughter the patient was home and feeling ok but she did
not have the "little yellow pill" that she was supposed to have
at home. Review of pill cards also notable for not taking
afternoon medications the day prior to admission including
labetalol. The VNA was to bring the clonidine today but she went
without them last night. This morning the family called 911 for
respiratory distress. Per EMS was slumped over in acute dyspnea,
initial BP 260/140. Received 6 double-sprays of Nitro and
intubated in field with 7.0 ETT. She came into ED not sedated
but intubated.

In the ED initial VS were 113 205/105 21 91% on CMV 450X14 FiO2
100% PEEP 10. ECG reportedly showed ST@106, LAD, but in leads
V1-V3, there are more pronounced changes of the bundle branch
block in addition to borderline hyperacute T waves in V3 (nearly
10 mm) different from prior. CXR showed bilateral pulmonary
edema but poor film. She was given lasix 120mg IV as well as
propofol and nitro gtt. HEr BP went from 205/105 -> 130s/70s.
She had virtually no UOP with placement of the foley but with
lasix did begin to have some UOP in the ED. ABG acidotic and
hypercarbic so increased the peep per the ED. ABG on repeat:
pH:7.35 pCO2:55 pO2:109 on CMV 450X14 FiO2 100% PEEP 10 with
patient overbreathing @ 22.
.
On arrival to the floor, the patient remained intubated. Family
present, and the plan for patient care was explained.

.
ROS: Not able to be performed. Patient intubated/sedated.

Pertinent Results:
Imaging: CXR ([**2127-4-27**]):

INDICATION: 64-year-old female referred for evaluation of
endotracheal tube

placement.



COMPARISON: None.



SUPINE PORTABLE CHEST:



An endotracheal tube is identified at the thoracic inlet,
positioned

approximately 5-6 cm above the carina. There are diffuse
pulmonary

opacities, which in conjunction with cardiomegaly most likely
represent

pulmonary edema, though multifocal infection or ARDS could have
a similar

appearance. There is blunting of the left costophrenic angle and
obscuration

of the left hemidiaphragm, suggesting effusion. There is no
pneumothorax.

There are no acute osseous abnormalities detected. Clinical
correlation and

followup imaging after diuresis are recommended.



CXR ([**4-27**]) - repeat

HISTORY: Nasogastric tube placement.



FINDINGS: In comparison with the earlier study of this date,
there is now a

nasogastric tube in place that extends at least to the mid body
of the stomach

where it crosses the lower margin of the image. The degree of
pulmonary edema

appears worse on the current study.

Findings

This study was compared to the prior study of [**2125-3-5**].

LEFT ATRIUM: Moderate LA enlargement.



RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Markedly dilated RA.



LEFT VENTRICLE: Mild symmetric LVH. Top normal/borderline

dilated LV cavity size. Suboptimal technical quality, a focal LV


wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Low normal

LVEF. No resting LVOT gradient.



RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.



AORTA: Normal aortic diameter at the sinus level. Mildly dilated


ascending aorta.



AORTIC VALVE: Normal aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS. No AR.



MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. Trivial

MR.



TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets with trivial

TR. Mild PA systolic hypertension.



PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Pulmonic valve not well seen.



PERICARDIUM: Trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

Conclusions

The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right atrium is

markedly dilated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular

hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is top

normal/borderline dilated. Due to suboptimal technical quality,

a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded,

although in the short-axis views there is a suggestion of focal

inferoseptal hypokinesis. Overall left ventricular systolic

function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%). Right ventricular chamber

size and free wall motion are normal.
