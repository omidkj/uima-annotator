HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was transferred to CCU team.

1.  Cardiology.  Coronary.  The patient ruled in for MI with
peak CK of 435, troponin greater than 50.  The patient's CKs
trended down throughout her stay.  The patient did not
complain of any chest pain while in the hospital.  She was
started on a beta blocker and ACE inhibitor as well as kept
on aspirin.  She was also started on Lipitor for LDL of 131.
Heparin was turned off once her CKs trended down.

2.  Pump.  The patient had EF of approximately 30% per echo,
ischemic cardiomyopathy.  The patient was treated for mild
CHF as the cause of her shortness of breath likely induced by
her MI.  She was gently diuresed, afterload reduced with an
ACE inhibitor and started on low dose beta blocker before
discharge.

3.  Electricity.  The patient remained on tele without event.

4.  Pulmonary.  The patient was not treated for specific COPD
exacerbation.  She was given albuterol and Atrovent nebs
p.r.n. and put back on her standing dose of prednisone for
COPD.  Cause of COPD likely 60 pack year smoking history.
The patient required less oxygen throughout the short course
of her stay and O2 was turned down to 2 liters nasal cannula
before discharge.

5.  FEN.  The patient was put on cardiac 2 gm sodium diet,
started on outpatient thiamine and folate meds.

6.  ID.  The patient did not appear clinically infected
throughout her stay.  UA was negative as were cultures of

7.  Heme.  The patient had hematocrit of 28, hovering around
27 during her stay.  The patient was not symptomatic from
this and was not transfused.  Unclear etiology.  Iron studies
were sent and pending at discharge.

line was taken out.  Foley kept in, unclear if has it at
[**Hospital6 459**].

11. Prophylaxis.  The patient was maintained on subcu
heparin, Protonix as an inpatient, which were stopped at
