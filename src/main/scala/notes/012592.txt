Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 783**]
Chief Complaint:
Edema, fatigue

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
The pt is a 68 yo M with a h/o hemochromatosis and DM2 recently
admitted to this hospital with a MSSA bacteremia, PNA, ARF with
creat 3.4, hyperK 6.0 and lactic acidosis with AG of 25. Pt had
fallen and was taking large amounts of Motrin prior to that
admission. On that admission, EKG showed right heart strain and
possible lateral ischemic changes. Pulmonary embolism was
considered; V/Q scan was read as low probability. He was
admitted to the MICU for hypotension and a PNA and then sent to
the floor, finished course Oxacillin for bacteremia while in
house. Other issues during that hospitalization included:
-CTA [**1-16**] showed an enlarged left-sided pleural effusion (fluid
density) and a R-sided pleural effusion that was determined to
be solid on thorocentesis (Path result is pending)
-HIV, [**Doctor First Name **] and RF were sent and found to be negative; scleroderma
ab neg
-[**1-8**] TTE was obtained and showed a dilated RV with severe
global free wall hypokinesis and abnormal septal movement;
moderate-severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension
consistent with a primary pulmonary process. LVEF was >55%.
-Seen on CTA [**2143-1-16**]:
1. 3mm pulmonary nodule in the right middle lobe.
2. hypodense oval lesion approx 8mm at the liver dome.
Recommend follow-up CT in 1 year.
.
Pt returned to [**Location **] [**2143-1-29**] with c/o increased fatigue and marked
increase in peripheral edema. On home O2 since discharge home.
States compliant with meds. Denies CP/worsened SOB/abd
pain/HA/F/C. Admits cough with small amt white sputum
occasionally.
.
CCU Course: Pt was started on Viagra for Primary Pulmonary HTN,
and aggressively diuresed with Lasix gtt and diuril for several
days with net [**Location 10226**]7.4L with symptomatic improvement in SOB on
5LNC, also started on anticoagulation with Lovenox for several
days however switched to Hep gtt and will transition to
coumadin. Thoracentesis on [**2-7**] removed ~800 cc serosanguinous
fluid which was negative for malignant cells. He was also
started on steroids for COPD. His O2 Sats were stable on 5LNC.
On [**2-12**] pt's sats stable while working with physical therapy. Pt
also noted to go in and out of AF/Flutter, was started on
Digoxin, dosed by levels. His CRI was followed closely and Cr
stable at 1.9 in setting of aggressive diuresis. Pt was also
started on Dilt for better HR control in setting of AF/Flutter.
Pt was called out of MICU to floor in stable condition.

CXR [**2142-1-29**]: CHEST, PA AND LATERAL: Comparison is made to
[**2143-1-17**]. The lung volumes are low. The PICC line has
been removed. Allowing for low lung volumes, the cardiac and
mediastinal contours are unchanged. There is a persistent right
lower lobe opacity, probably some atelectasis in addition to
effusion. There is also a left-sided effusion with parenchymal
opacity obscuring the medial hemidiaphragm, which may represent
atelectasis. Right apical thickening is unchanged since a prior
study from [**2138**]. IMPRESSION: Moderate bibasilar effusions and
opacities, which are likely to represent atelectasis. Underlying
pneumonia cannot be excluded however.
.
CXR [**2143-1-30**]: PRELIMINARY READ
PA and lateral chest. There are bilateral moderate-sized pleural
effusions with possible partial posterior loculation. The
cardiac silhouette is enlarged. I doubt the presence of vascular
congestion although appearances suggest possible underlying
chronic lung disease with stranding in the right lung. Since
exam one day previous the equivocal interstitial edema appears
improved or resolved. The effusions are associated with
bibasilar subsegmental atelectasis. IMPRESSION: Short interval
probable improvement/resolution of CHF. No change in effusions.

COMMENTS:     1.  Vasodilator challenge in this patient with
pulmonary
hypertension revealed baseline severe pulmonary hypertension
with
pressures of 82/43.  The RA pressure was slightly elevated at
mean of
14mmHG with a relatively normal left sided filling pressure with
PCWP of
11mmHG.   The cardiac index was preserved at 2.2.
2.  With 100% oxygen and then nitric oxide there was no decrease
in
pulmonary pressures.  With oxygen PA was measured at 83/38 mean
57 and
PCWP of 13mmHG.  With nitric oxygen pressure was 91/39 wit mean
of 60.
The cardiac index did improve on oxygen to 2.7 and on nitric
oxide to
3.2
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Severe pulmonary hypertension with normal left sided filling
pressures, not responsive to vasodilators.
.
[**2143-2-4**] ECHO Bubble Study:
Conclusions:
No definite right-to-left passage of microbubbles identified at
rest or with  maneuvers (cough, post-Valsalva). The right
ventricle is dilated with prominent free wall hypokinesis.
.
[**2143-2-4**] CXR:
INDICATION: CHF versus developing pneumonia.
A right subclavian vascular catheter remains in place,
terminating at the junction of the superior vena cava and right
atrium. The cardiac silhouette is enlarged but stable. There is
upper zone vascular redistribution and perihilar haziness, not
significantly changed. There is partial atelectasis of the right
lower lobe with inferomedial displacement of the right major
fissure. An area of increased opacity is noted within the left
retrocardiac region, with interval improvement since the recent
study. This is probably due to a combination of effusion and
atelectasis.
.
[**2143-2-6**] CHEST CT:
Bilateral pleural effusion, moderate and low density on the
left, and small with high density contents and perimeter
enhancement is unchanged in both hemithoraces. Bibasilar
consolidation is more pronounced in comparison to the previous
studies and may represent pneumonia or secondary atelectasis.
Prominence of the interlobular septa as well as some engorgement
of the pulmonary vasculature
