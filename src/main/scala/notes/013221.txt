Allergies:
Penicillins

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2009**]
Chief Complaint:
RUQ pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
This is an 86 year old spanish speaking woman with a PMH
significant for atrial fibrillation (on coumadin), CKD (Cr [**1-4**]
1.5), systolic CHF (EF 10%), DMII, UTIs, HTN, colon cancer s/p
colectomy, depression and dementia who presents with RUQ pain
that started today.  She was evaluated at her nursing home where
there was concern for a possible biliary process.  Per her
daughter who was with her earlier today the patient was close to
her baseline mental status.
.
In the ED, initial vs were: 97.6 105 86/52 16 96% RA. Her exam
was notable for tender RUQ with guarding.  SBP remained in 80s
to 90s. Her labs were notable for luekocytosis 15 with 85%
polys, no bands, elevated Cr 2.2, mildly elevated AP and AST
(159, 106), and lactate 3.4, glucose 67.  Her UA was notable for
bacturia, pyuria, and leuks. A KUB was done that did not show
obstruction (my read) and CT abdomen/pelvis was notable for
bilateral perinephric stranding and fluid and no gallbladder
visualized.  Patient was given 20mg prednisone, flagyl and cipro
for concern of gallbladder process, and 1amp D50 for
hypoglycemia.  She received a total of 1L NS in addition to the
fluids in her antibiotics.  On discussion with health care
proxy, patient remains DNR/DNI and does not desire invasive
measures such as central line and pressors.  Vital signs on
transfer were T 96.8, BP 89/56, HR 90, RR 21, O2 sat 100% RA.
.
Of note, she was recently discharged after hospitalization at
[**Hospital1 18**] [**Date range (1) 107620**] for hypoxia and altered mental status.  She
had an echo done significant for presumed ischemic
cardiomyopathy with an EF 10% and bivent failure.  She improved
with diuresis and treatment for a pneumonia w/ levaquin.
.
On the floor, the patient was having RUQ pain, but easily
drifted off to sleep.  She denied any cough, chest pain, nausea,
vomiting, diarrhea, fevers, or chills.

RUQ US: IMPRESSION: No cholelithiasis or secondary signs of
cholecystitis to explain the patient's right upper quadrant
pain. The gallbladder is small, possibly normal anatomy in this
patient, though this should be correlated for possible history
of previous partial cholecystectomy.

Brief Hospital Course:
1.  Pyelonephritis complicated by sepsis, requiring ICU
admission:
Ms [**Known lastname **] was admitted to the MICU with concern for biliary
process given leukocytosis and worsening RUQ pain.  UA showed
significant pyuria and bacteria and CT abdomen was suggestive of
perinerphric stranding; no biliary abnormalities were
visualized.  A presumptive diagnosis of pyelonephritis was made.
 Given her history of recurrent UTIs, she was started
empirically on IV meropenem.  Although UA was positive, her
urine culture was negative.  Day 1 of meropenem was [**2-19**]; we
decided to treat her for a fourteen day course despite negative
cultures given frequency of recurrent UTIs per outside hospital
report and perinephric stranding seen on CT; last day of
meropenem will be [**2111-3-4**].
.
2.  Acute renal failure, with chronic kidney disease, stage II:

 Her creatinine was noted to be elevated (baseline is 1.5) with
her creatinine near 2.3, thought to be secondary to poor forward
flow.  Her EF is only 10% and so to improve perfusion to her
kidney, we initiated diuresis with lasix with a goal of -500 mLs
- 1 L.  Her creatinine improved mildly to 2.1 with lasix; she
was transitioned to PO bumetanide as per her home regimen of 4
mg [**Hospital1 **].  We held her ACE inhibitor secondary to her acute on
chronic renal failure.   It will be started at discharge at a
lower dose.
.
3.  Atrial fibrillatoin with poor rate control, subtherapeutic
INR:
She continued to be in atrial fibrillation; her metoprolol was
titrated up for rate control.  Her INR was subtherapeutic and
she was started on IV heparin on [**2-20**] in addition to her
coumadin dose of 3.5 mg daily.    She remained poorly rate
controlled and was eventually started on metoprolol 50 mg q6 and
diltiazem 30 mg po qid.  She will be transitioned to daily
formulations on discharge.  She should have daily pulse checks
for bradycardia, although there were no abnormalities on
telemetry.
.
4.  Diabetes mellitus, type II, controlled:
 Her metformin was held in the setting of renal failure; she
covered on an insulin sliding scale.
.
5.  Dementia:  mild.  No evidence of acute delirium.
.
Disposition:  after discussion with her nurse practitioner at
her nursing home, and her family, she was discharged back to the
[**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 1188**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] with goal of transitioning to comfort measures.
Her heparin drip was stopped at discharge.
