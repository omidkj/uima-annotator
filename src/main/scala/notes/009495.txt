History of Present Illness:
66 year old man with hx of Parkinson's disease, Hep C, DM who
presents as a transfer from outside hospital after a fall down
stairs.  Patient notes that he felt lightheaded and noted his BP
to 97/45 at home.  He took a nap and after he awoke he denies

Studies:[**2121-11-14**]
CT Pelvis Ortho:
IMPRESSION:
1.  Complex fracture through the sacral ala and S2 vertebral
body extrusion of bone in sacral canal.
2.  Left pubic bone undisplaced fracture.
3.  Retroperitoneal hemorrhage.  CTs of the remainder of the
abdomen advised to exclude other injury.
.
CT ABD and Pelvix
LUNG BASES:  There is left pleural effusion which contains
hyperdense fluid,likely blood.  Patchy airspace opacity is noted
in the lower lobes
bilaterally, which may in part reflect aspiration and s degree
of atelectasis. The heart appears unremarkable.
ABDOMEN:  The liver, spleen, gallbladder, and adrenal glands
appear
unremarkable demonstrating no evidence of acute injury.  There
is a
hypodensity in the pancreatic body, which measures 5.7 mm and
may represent a small cyst, though a cystic neoplasm cannot be
excluded.  There is no pancreatic ductal dilatation or
peripancreatic fluid.  Post-surgical changes are seen at the
gastroesophageal junction.  There is a small hiatal hernia
noted.  There are small bilateral renal hypodensities, which
likely represent small cysts.  There is no hydronephrosis.
Right-sided retroperitoneal hematoma is noted as well as
intraperitoneal hematoma layering along the pericolic gutters,
right greater than left.  Pelvic hematoma is also noted, most
prominently in the presacral region.
Small enlarged bowel loops are unopacified, though demonstrate
no evidence of ileus or obstruction.  There is no evidence of
free air to indicate bowel rupture.  There is haziness and
stranding along the mesentery, and underlying mesenteric
hematoma is suggested in the lower pelvis, though not
definitively characterized due to an large amount of underlying
blood.  Post-contrast and delayed images demonstrate no evidence
of active contrast extravasation to indicate active bleeding.
PELVIS:  The bladder is decompressed around a Foley catheter.
Per history, there is no hematuria and therefore underlying
bladder injury is less likely. As stated above, a large amount
of pelvic hematoma is present which appears to surround bowel
loops as well as pool within the extraperitoneal location. There
is no evidence of underlying solid organ injury and therefore
this large volume of hematoma is likely secondary to numerous
pelvic fractures, which are more thoroughly discussed on
previously performed pelvic CT scan reported separately.
BONE WINDOWS:  Multiple fractures involving the sacrum are
identified, with small anteriorly displaced fracture fragments
noted on the sagittal
reformations.  Right L4 and L5 transverse process fractures are
also noted.  A lucency traverses the left pubic body, likely
also indicating a nondisplaced fracture.  Please refer to
dedicated CT pelvis for further detailed description of the
fractures.
IMPRESSION:
1.  No evidence of solid organ injury.  Large volume of
retroperitoneal and intraperitoneal hematoma without evidence of
active extravasation.  Hematoma most likely secondary to
multiple pelvic fractures.
2.  Extensive fracture involving the sacrum, with additional
fractures of the right L4 and L5 transverse process and left
pubic body.  Please refer to dedicated CT of the bony pelvis for
further detail.
3.  Hypodensity within the pancreatic body, may represent a
pseudocyst in this patient if there is a history of
pancreatitis.  Otherwise, cystic neoplasm may be considered.
.
CT Head from OSH:
Basal ganglia electrodes present bilaterally, no acute
intracranial abnormality.  Complete opacification of the
sphenoid sinus.  Small fluid level in right frontal sinus.
.
CT Cspine from OSH: degenerative disc narrowing at C5-C6, no
acute fracture.  no prevertbral soft tissue swelling is
identified.

CTA [**11-14**]: 1. No evidence of solid organ injury. Large volume of
retroperitoneal and intraperitoneal hematoma without evidence of
active extravasation. Hematoma most likely secondary to
extensive sacral injury.
2. Extensive fracture involving the sacrum, with additional
fractures of the right L4 and L5 transverse process and left
pubic bone. Please refer to dedicated CT of the bony pelvis for
further detail.
3. Hypodensity within the pancreatic body, may represent a
pseudocyst in this patient if there is a history of
pancreatitis. Otherwise, cystic neoplasm may be considered.
Clinical correlation and imaging followup is advised.
4. Left hemothorax, bibasilar pulmonary airspace opacity may
represent aspitation and atelectasis.

Pelvis [**11-14**]: FINDINGS: There are five non-rib-bearing lumbar
vertebrae. There is partial sacralization of L5 with
pseudoarticulation of the left transverse processes of L5 with
the iliac crest. Mild degenerative changes including disc space
narrowing and facet degenerative changes are seen at L4-L5. The
SI joints are unremarkable and without evidence of diastasis.
The hip joints and pubic symphysis is unremarkable. Known sacral
alar and body fractures in given history are not readily
identified on this study. CT exam is recommended for further
evaluation.

[**11-15**] CT pelvis:
1. No evidence of solid organ injury as was mentioned on the
previous study. Large but stable volume of retroperitoneal and
extraperitoneal hematoma secondary to multiple pelvic fractures.

2. Extensive fractures involving the sacrum. For prec
