History of Present Illness:
This is a 78 year-old male nursing home resident with coronary
artery disease, ischemic cardiomyopathy leading to CHF (EF 20%),
type II diabetes with neuropathy and nephropathy, end stage
renal disease status post failed transplant on hemodialysis and
recent amputation of left foot for gangrene presents with
altered mental status.  He was most recently admitted to [**Hospital1 18**]
between [**2171-5-22**] to [**2171-5-25**] with fevers thought to be due to line
sepsis from his hemodialysis line verse pneumonia.  At that
time, he was treated with vancomycin and ceftriaxone.  He also
has a known transudative, left sided pleural effusion thought to
be due to his CHF.  As per the daughter, he has been feeling
illness for the past two weeks and was given a diagnsosis of
pneumonia. During this time, he was feeling lethergic and
fatigued. He subseqeuently completed a 10-day course of
levofloxacin for a community acquired pneumonia. He was without
significant complaints until yesterday when he developed fever
to 101.  He felt ill, "sick as a dog", with respiratory
distress.  He was subsequently given a neb/cool mist mask but he
appeared confused (he reported being locked up in the jail at
[**Location (un) 669**]) and appeared more ill by the daughter.  During previous
episodes of infection, he had also become equally confused.  He
was started on erythromycin 333mg [**Hospital1 **]  for a 10-day course for
presumed pneumonia at the time.  This morning, he developed
altered mental status in addition to fever. At baseline, he is
alert and oriented.  At his nursing home however, he was
lethargic and confused.  In addition, he was found to be
diaphoretic, and tachypneic with some respiratory distress. He
was referred to the [**Hospital1 18**] [**Location (un) 620**] ED, where he had an episode of
apnea in the resuscitation bay.  He was intubated, and given
Levofloxacin, zosyn, vancomycin as well as decadron.  He had an
episode of hypotension and started on Dopamine. Physical
examination was significant for surgical wound of left foot and
scrotal erythema.  Urinalysis was positive and chest x-ray was
without any obvious infiltrate and head CT was without evidence
of a bleed. A left IJ was placed and he was trasnferred to
[**Hospital1 18**].

Brief Hospital Course:
This is 78 year-old male nursing home resident admitted with
altered mental status, hypotension, and fevers.
.
1. Hypotension/Fevers: The likely source of his fevers and
hypotension was urosepsis given his positive urinalysis.  Other
infectious work-up was negative.  His cortisol stimulation test
was within normal limits.  He also received 7 days of stress
dose steroids.  He completed a course of vancomycin, zosyn, and
tobramycin empirically for urinary tract infection.  He had a
repeat urinalysis that had elevated white cells.  He was treated
empirically with a 10 day course of ciprofloxacin.  He will
complete the course as an outpatient.  All of his urine cultures
were only positive for yeast.
.
2. Altered Mental Status: His lethargy and increased confusion
where attributed to his underlying infection.  He had a head CT
that was negative for mass effect or stroke.  His mental status
cleared as his fevers and hypotension resolved.
.
3. Ventilatory support: He was intubated for apnea at the
outside hospital.  As his sepsis and mental status improved, he
was easily weaned from the ventilator and extubated without
difficulty.
.
4. End stage renal disease: He has a history of chronic renal
disease likely secondary to diabetes with a baseline creatinine
of 2.0-2.4.  During this admission, he was maintained on
Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday dialysis.  He was also maintained on
nephrocaps, doxecalceferol, and epoeitin with dialysis.
.
5. History of seizure: He has a history of seizure in the
setting of sepsis in the past.  On admission, his dilantin level
was subtherapeutic (0.6).  He was maintained on dilantin
throughout the admission.  He was given 2 days of 300 mf
dilantin [**Hospital1 **] with increase in his dilantin level.  Also, his
tube feeds were held before and after dilantin doses to prevent
binding of the dilantin by the tube feeds.  On discharge his
corrected dilantin level was about 7.
.
6.Coronary artery disease: He had no evidence of active
ischemia.  He was maintained on aspirin and statin.  His
beta-blocker and [**Last Name (un) **] were restarted once he was no longer
hypotensive.
.
7. Congestive heart failure: He had some evidence of volume
overload as evidence by respiratory distress.  He received an
extra round of dialysis with good effect.  he was maintained on
his regular cardiac medications.
.
8. History of DVT: He had a history of 2 prior DVTs.  His
coumadin was initially held given procedures performed in the
ICU.  At that time, he was anticoagulated with argatoban.  When
