Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Penicillins

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1899**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Insertion of Metronic Dual Chamber Adapta L pacemaker


History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **]M with a history of CAD s/p CABG in [**2124**] and recent admissions
([**8-6**]) for inferior STEMI s/p DES in SVG-LAD and CP r/o MI ([**8-17**],
d/c'ed [**8-18**]), CHF, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (not on
anticoagulation) p/w substernal chest pain, and was found to
have A-fib w/ RVR.
.
His symptom started at 3pm. He was asleep, and woke up because
of chest pain. Pain was described as midsternal, with radiation
to both arms, very similar to the pain he had during prior
ischemic events, but gradually worsening to [**11-11**], with no
diaphoresis, sob, n/v. He tried two sl nitro, but did not help.

.
Of note, he was recently admitted for an inferior wall STEMI
with peak CK-MB of 41 and troponin of 1.03. He underwent urgent
cardiac cath for revascularization with occluded SVG-RCA. Cath
was complicated by hypotension with IABP insertion. Repeat
angiography of SVG-LAD revealed 95 % stenosis of its ostium and
underwent PTCA and one drug-eluting stent. Post-procedure ECHO
showed EF 30 % similar to previous baseline. He was subsequently
discharged with plavix, aspirin, atorvastatin, and lisinopril.
He was placed on low-dose beta blockade but experienced
bradycardia.
.
In the ED, initial vitals were 113 91/63 12 98% 1L Nasal
Cannula.
Pt rated pain [**11-11**] upon arrival. He had ASA 325 X1, 4mg
Morphine IV x1 which helped. He also received Amiodarone bolus
of 150 mg over 15 mins x2. Heart rate dropped from 125 bpm to 96
bpm after 2nd dose. Then Amiodarone gtt started at 1mg/hr. Pt
states pain is 0/10 at this time.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of dyspnea on
exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema,
palpitations, syncope or presyncope, claudication.
.
Other ROS is notable for vision loss (only perceptable to light)
on the right side. Pt unclear about when it started exactly, but
likely within a month. Pt also c/o hesitency during urination,
which has been a chronic issue.
He denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous
thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery,
myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red
stools. He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.

PERTINENT STUDIES
# Portable CXR [**8-17**]
UPRIGHT AP VIEW OF THE CHEST: The patient is status post median
sternotomy, CABG. There is moderate enlargement of the cardiac
silhouette which is unchanged. The aorta is mildly tortuous and
diffusely calcified, which is stable. Multiple calcified
mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes are again demonstrated. There
is mild pulmonary vascular congestion. Increasing opacification
of the right lung base may represent worsening atelectasis,
pulmonary edema, or infection. Blunting of the right
costophrenic angle is redemonstrated suggestive of a small
pleural effusion. There is no pneumothorax. No acute osseous
abnormalities are seen.

IMPRESSION:
1. Mild pulmonary vascular congestion.
2. Increasing patchy opacity in the right lung base may reflect
worsening
atelectasis, edema, or infection. Small right pleural effusion,
unchanged.
.
# Portable CXR [**8-21**]
INDICATION: [**Age over 90 **]-year-old man with tachybrady syndrome status post
dual-chamber pacemaker implant using the axillary vein. Question
any pneumothorax.
The lungs are well expanded and show mild bilateral interstitial
opacities.  The cardiac silhouette is top normal. The
mediastinal silhouette and hilar contours are normal. No pleural
effusions or pneumothorax is present. A left-sided pacer
terminates with its leads in the right atrium and right
ventricle appropriately. Sternal wires are intact.
IMPRESSION:
Mild interstitial edema. No pneumothorax.
.
# CXR PA/Lateral [**8-22**]
FINDINGS: Lungs are well expanded. Left lung field is clear
without vascular congestion or pulmonary edema. The right lung
shows chronic apical changes with scarring and nodular
thickening of the apical pleura and a prominent minor fissure
which are unchanged since at least [**2153-10-3**]. Compared with
radiograph on [**8-21**] and after accounting for difference in
positioning and technique, there is mild worsening of the right
lower lobe opacity with obscuring of the right hemidiaphragm.
Blunting of the right pleural sulcus is like
