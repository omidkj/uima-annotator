History of Present Illness:
59 y/o F with history of COPD, CAD s/p angioplasty in '[**08**], AFib,
VT s/p ICD placement in '[**12**], admitted to [**Hospital1 1516**] on [**11-17**] because
of recurrent VT and ICD firing, now admitted to the CCU for
recurrent sustained VT and multiple ICD firing.
Pt was in USOH until the night PTA, when she was woken from
sleep by several ICD firings. Her ICD fired 3x at home with
shocks preceded by lightheadedness but no other sx.
When EP evaluated the pt in the ED, she was in NSR with PVCs and
interrogation revealed appropriate ICD firings for VT. Pt was
admitted to the floor, Toprol was increased to 50mg po and a
Lidocaine drip was started for recurrent sustained VT. On the
floor, the pt continued to have ICD firings for VT. At 3pm the
pt was noted to be in AFib with RVR that progressed to VT at
240bpm and a code was called. The pt was sedated and intubated
because of multiple ICD firings (17 in total) and was then
bolused with Amiodarone and started on amiodarone drip at
1mg/min with cessation of VTach. The pt's BP remained stable
throughout and on arrival in the CCU, the pt's vitals were
stable and EKG was in NSR with PVCs.
Of note, in advance of umbilical hernia repair, pt dc'd ASA on
[**11-8**] and coumadin on [**11-14**].

hypertrophy with dilated left ventricle and focal regional
systolic dysfunction consistent with coronary artery disease.

Brief Hospital Course:
59 yo woman with COPD, CAD s/p angioplasty, VT s/p ICD, admitted
to CCU for sustained VTach.

#. Rhythm: On presentation to CCU, pt was in normal sinus rhythm
on PO Amiodarone and Lopressor with improving PVCs. Pt had pacer
pads placed as ICD battery had been used up by the multiple
firings, but did not require any external shocking. Pt underwent
cardiac cath and echo (see results below) and then ablation of
left ventricular source. Following ablation, no arrythmias were
inducible. Pt underwent ICD change without complications,
however after had a recurrent run of ventricular tachycardia
afterwards. She was shocked by her ICD and restarted on
Amiodarone drip (in addition to PO) as well as started on
Mexilitine. Prior to discharge she was free of VT for several
days and was transitioned to PO Amiodarone and Mexilitine. She
is to have one more week of Amiodarone [**Hospital1 **] then to transition to
once daily. Pt had normal TFTs and LFTs, but will need PFTs done
as an outpt for baseline on Amiodarone. Will require twice
annual tfts and lfts, and an annual chest xray, pfts, and eye
exam.  Reviewed in detail potential amiodarone toxicities and
importance of f/u testing.  Pt understands.  These tests will be
deferred to pt's PCP and primary cardiologist.

#. CAD: Pt was continued on Lopressor, ASA, Pravastatin,
Lisinopril, Isosorbide Mononitrate and Lasix. She did not have
any EKG changes or cardiac enzyme elevations throughout her
hospitalization. ECHO showed "Suboptimal image quality. Mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with dilated left
ventricle and focal regional systolic dysfunction consistent
with coronary artery disease. Mildly dilated right ventricle
with mild hypokinesis." Cardiac Cath on [**11-18**] showed one vessel
coronary artery disease (not stented) and severe LV diastolic
dysfunction.

# ID: Pt developed an E Coli UTI, initially treated with Bactrim
DS. She was found to be resistent to Bactrim and switched to
Keflex to cover both the UTI and the ICD prophylaxis. On day of
discharge pt had developed some superficial cellulitis at sites
of blood draw and had an increasing WBC. She was restarted on
Bactrim to cover for possible MRSA (although earlier MRSA screen
was negative). At time of discharge pt was on day 6 of 7 of
Keflex and on day 2 of 10 of Bactrim. Blood cultures were neg on
[**11-19**] and were resent on [**11-25**] and were pending at time of
discharge.

# Respiratory: Pt was initially intubated due to multiple ICD
firings. She was extubated without complications. Given history
of COPD and copious secretions likely due to airway irritation,
pt was continued on Atrovent and Albuterol as needed and O2 was
weened to room air.
