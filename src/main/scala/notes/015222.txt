Chief Complaint:
hemoptysis, shortness of breath, CXRAY reveals medistinal mass

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
mediastinoscopy, bronchoscopy, evacuation of mediastinal
hematoma.


History of Present Illness:
84-year-old gentleman with
mechanical mitral valve replacement who is a nonsmoker. He
does have asbestos exposure, having worked in a shipyard. He
had an episode of hemoptysis as well as mild shortness of
breath prompting a chest x-ray and a subsequent CT scan which
confirmed a large subcarinal mass. A PET scan showed intense
FDG uptake in the subcarinal mass with an SUV greater than
20. The transbronchial biopsy was nondiagnostic. We
recommended mediastinoscopy. This required admission for
conversion of Coumadin the heparin and with his heparin
discontinued for several hours he was brought to the
operating room for the procedure.

 RADIOLOGY   Preliminary Report

CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2194-10-4**] 7:17 PM

CHEST (PA & LAT)

Reason: Wheezing, slight dyspnea

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
84 year old man with bloody sputum
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
Wheezing, slight dyspnea
HISTORY: Body sputum, wheezing, dyspnea.

CHEST, TWO VIEWS.

The patient is status post sternotomy, with mitral valve.

There is extensive calcification overlying both lungs related to
calcified asbestos plaques. Prominence of the cardiomediastinal
silhouette is noted in this patient with a known hematoma. The
trachea above the carina is poorly defined. A right subclavian
central line is present, tip overlying uppermost right atrium. I
doubt the presence of a superimposed infiltrate. I doubt the
presence of CHF. No effusion is identified.

IMPRESSION: No significant change detected compared with
[**2194-10-2**].
