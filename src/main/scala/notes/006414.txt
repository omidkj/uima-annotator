PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH:

New mild pulmonary edema. The mild cardiomegaly is unchanged.
The sternal
wires are intact. A right IJ terminates in the distal SVC in
appropriate
position. Linear atelectasis in the left lower lobe is
unchanged. No pleural
effusions are present.

IMPRESSION: New mild pulmonary edema.

Echocardiographic Measurements
Results  Measurements  Normal Range
Left Ventricle - Ejection Fraction:  40% to 45%  >= 55%

Findings
LEFT ATRIUM: Moderate LA enlargement. No spontaneous echo
contrast is seen in the LAA. Good (>20 cm/s) LAA ejection
velocity. No thrombus in the LAA.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Normal RA size. A catheter or
pacing wire is seen in the RA and extending into the RV. No ASD
by 2D or color Doppler.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thickness. Top normal/borderline
dilated LV cavity size. Mildly depressed LVEF. [Intrinsic LV
systolic function likely depressed given the severity of
valvular regurgitation.]

RIGHT VENTRICLE: RV hypertrophy. Normal RV chamber size.

AORTA: Normal aortic diameter at the sinus level. Normal
ascending aorta diameter. Normal aortic arch diameter. Normal
descending aorta diameter.

AORTIC VALVE: Three aortic valve leaflets. Mildly thickened
aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS. No AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Moderately thickened mitral valve leaflets. No
mass or vegetation on mitral valve. Mild mitral annular
calcification. Moderate thickening of mitral valve chordae. No
MS. Moderate to severe (3+) MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Mild [1+] TR.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflet.
No PS. Physiologic PR.

PERICARDIUM: Trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify I was present in compliance with HCFA
regulations. The patient was under general anesthesia throughout
the procedure. The patient received antibiotic prophylaxis. The
TEE probe was passed with assistance from the anesthesioology
staff using a laryngoscope. No TEE related complications.
patient.

REGIONAL LEFT VENTRICULAR WALL MOTION:





     N = Normal, H = Hypokinetic, A = Akinetic, D = Dyskinetic
Conclusions
PRE-CPB:
1. The left atrium is moderately dilated. No spontaneous echo
contrast is seen in the left atrial appendage. No thrombus is
seen in the left atrial appendage. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler.
2. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity size is top normal/borderline dilated.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed
(LVEF= 40 %). [Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is
likely more depressed given the severity of valvular
regurgitation.]
3. The right ventricular free wall is hypertrophied. Right
ventricular chamber size is normal.
4. There are three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is no aortic valve
stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen.
5. The mitral valve leaflets are moderately thickened. No mass
or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve. There is moderate
thickening of the mitral valve chordae. Moderate to severe (3+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. There is a central jet. The
annulus measures 3.8-3.9 cm.
6. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in person of the results.

POST-CPB: On infusion of epi briefly, phenylephrine. Sinus
rhythm. Well-seated annuloplasty ring in the mitral position. MR
is 1+. MS is 5 cm H2O. Preserved biventricular systolic function
with LVEF now 50%. Aortic contour is normal post decannulation.

  I certify that I was present for this procedure in compliance
with HCFA regulations.

Brief Hospital Course:
Same day admit after undergoing all pre-operative work-up as an
outpatient. On [**4-5**] she was brought directly to the operating
room where she underwent a mitral valve repair. Please see
operative report for surgical details. Within 24 hours she was
weaned from sedation, awoke neurologically intact and extubated.
She did have frequent ventricular ectopy and was placed on a
lidocaine drip intraoperatively.  This was stopped due to a
junctional rhythm on postoperative night.  She was started on
oral amiodarone on postoperative day 1 once she was in sinus
rhythm due to continued ventricular ectopy. She was weaned from
all vasoactive medications on her postoperative night.
Swan-Ganz catheter was removed with good cardiac output/index on
postoperative day 1. A nasogastric tube was placed postoperative
night due to nausea and vomiting.  This was removed on post
operative day 1 and Reglan was started for hypoactive bowel
sounds.  She was changed from Percocet to Ultram due to nausea,
which resolved.  She was transferred to the step down unit on
postoperative day 2 in stable condition.  Pacing wires and chest
tubes were removed per cardiac surgery protocol.  She continued
to work with physical therapy to improve strength and endurance.
 She continued to progress, amiodarone was discontinued as
ventricular ectopy resolved.   She was ready for discharge home
with services post operative day 4.
