[**6-1**] Echo: PRE-CPB:1. The left atrium is moderately dilated. Mild
spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body of the left

atrial appendage. The left atrial appendage emptying velocity is
depressed (<0.2m/s). No thrombus is seen in the left atrial
appendage. 2. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color
Doppler. 3. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. The
LVEF = 55%. 4. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
