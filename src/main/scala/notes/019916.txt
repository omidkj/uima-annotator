Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5129**]
Chief Complaint:
Abdominal pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
This is a 65 year old woman with hisotry of Myasthenia [**Last Name (un) **]
who presents with progressive abdominal pain and possible MG
flare.
.
The pain started two weeks ago as diffuse pain which then moved
to the mid pelvis region. It was described as sharp and crampy,
worse when lying to her sides and after defecation. Denied
n/v/d/fever/chills/hematochez/melena. She has never had
abdominal surgery or hernias. She was recently admitted to ETS
service with abdominal pain. CT abdomen at the time was reported
as mild diverticulitis. Initally treated with cipro/flagyl and
then switched to cefpodoxime/flagyl. Called PCP today with
[**Name9 (PRE) 95371**] abd pain and told to come to ED.
.
In the ED initial vitals were: T:98 HR:100 BP:174/93 RR:40.
Looked in respiratory distress. NIF was -20 and VC 1.6. ABG:
7.42/48/87/32. She was thought to be having a myasthenia [**Last Name (un) 2902**]
flare. She was given Vanc/flagyl/zosyn for presumed
intra-abdominal infection leading to the MG flare. In CT scan
could not lay flat and she had to be intubated in ED. CT Torso
revealed no saddle embolus but poor scan so started heparin
empirically. Also with evidence of lll PNA (not on CT Abd a few
days ago). Also has worsening diverticulitis so surgery asked to
eval in ED. Neuro was consulted and said hold on tx for MG for
now given possible infection currently, Staffed with Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **].
[**Doctor Last Name 18530**]. recommended MICU admit, check NIFs & VCs q6h - neuro
will follow as consult. Cdiff was sent as thought infection
might have precipitated this flare. NIF was -20. Received
Vanc/Zosyn/Flagyl. Intubated using etomidate and recuronium and
versed/fentanyl. Started on hep gtt. Also got KCl for K of 2.9.
Surgery was called and said no changes in antibiotics and NPO.
Prior to transfer to the floor CT Chest read as ETT too low.
Pulled back by ED and repeat CXR ok per ED report on arrival to
the floor patient was intubated and sedated.

CXR:
FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of earlier in this date,
the tip of the endotracheal tube now measures approximately 2.6
cm above the carina.  Nasogastric tube again extends well into
the stomach. Extensive opacification is seen at the left base
consistent with volume loss and pleural effusion. There is
apparent opacification in the left perihilar region. This could
represent an area of developing aspiration or volume loss
related to mucus plugging.

CTA torso [**5-2**]: 1. Sigmoid diverticulitis with adjacent punctate
foci of air compatible with focal perforation, mildly worsened
in appearance from prior study. No drainable fluid collection.
2. New left lower lobe collapse secondary to mucus
plugging/aspiration. 3. Nondiagnostic study for evaluation of
pulmonary embolism. No central thrombus. In case of continued
clinical concern for pulmonary embolism, a repeat study can be
obtained.

CTA chest [**5-3**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. No pulmonary embolism or aortic pathology.
2. Near-complete LLL collapse and partial RLL collapse,
unchanged. Small
focal superimposed infection cannot be excluded.
3. Marked left hemithorax volume loss, with leftward shift of
mediastinal
structures, also unchanged. No pneumothorax.
4. Small left-sided pleural effusion tracks along the major
fissure.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 65 year old woman with history of myasthenia
[**Last Name (un) 2902**] who was admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] on [**5-2**] with progressive
abdominal pain, respiratory distress requiring intubation, and
possible MG flare. She has known diverticular disease and
imaging at admission was consistent with diverticulitis flare
with microperforation. Surgery was consulted and she was treated
with bowel rest with improvement; she was  cleared from a
surgical standpoint given resolution of her abdominal pain and
ability to tolerate po diet. She is to complete a 14 day course
of Zosyn.
.
Her respiratory distress was initially thought to be
multifactorial: diaphragm weakness from MG flare and splinting
from abd pain, but imaging was suggestive of PNA and this was
thought to be the main cause of her respiratory failure. There
was also initial concern for PE, but this was ruled out on CTA
chest. She was noted to improve on antibiotics (Vancomycin and
Zosyn). Barriers to extubation were weak NIF (-20), fluid
overload and copious secretions. She was diuresed to contraction
alkalosis. We held her mestinon, her secretions subsided and her
NIF improved to -60. She was successfully extubated on [**5-7**] and progressively weaned from face tent at 50% to nasal
cannula. Her mestinon was restarted 6 hours after extubation. An
ABG on [**5-8**] showed mild alkalosis with appropriate
respiratory compensation. Her respiratory status continued to
improve, and she completed an 8 day course of vancomycin and
Zosyn for hospital acquired pneumonia (still has  4 days of
Zosyn left at the time of discharge for the diverticulitis). She
