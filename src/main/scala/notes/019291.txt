HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mrs. [**Known lastname 94137**] is a 76-year-old
woman with history of severe right sided congestive heart
failure as well as unexplained drops in her hematocrits over
the past 2-3 years.  At baseline her congestive heart failure
is so severe that she is unable to walk for more than 15 feet
before becoming severely dyspneic.  Her hematocrit fluctuates
between 20 and 30 and she has required transfusions of red
blood cells, about 2 units q 6 hours.  She has had a normal
upper endoscopy and colonoscopy in early [**2178**] and the source
of her blood loss is not clear although it is felt to be
somewhere in the gastrointestinal tract.  Her husband
reports, as does the patient that overall her health has been
extremely poor these past several years and that she has had
25-30 inpatient admissions during this time.

The patient was transferred to the [**Hospital1 190**] for management of a hematocrit drop of 6
points in the past week from 31 to 25 and also for
hypotension to the 80's.  The patient was transferred from an
outside hospital.  When she presented, she was also in acute
renal failure with creatinine of 3.  Reviewing her past
records, her creatinine does fluctuate between 1 and 3.

Her blood pressure was stable in the 90's while she was
initially on the Intensive Care Unit.  Given that she has
severe diastolic heart failure, she did not receive fluid
boluses because they would not have benefitted her blood
pressure.  She instead received diuresis with intravenous
Lasix and her creatinine mom[**Name (NI) 11711**] improved.  She was
transferred out to the Intensive Care Unit to the medical
floor on [**2180-5-4**] where she was to have a colonoscopy and
upper endoscopy done to evaluate for source of bleeding.

The upper endoscopy revealed a bleeding duodenal
arteriovenous malformation which was cauterized.  The
colonoscopy was normal.  Nonetheless, the patient began
having hematocrits drop on [**2180-5-7**] and also had significant
abdominal pain beginning at that time.  It is not clear where
the blood was being lost.  She received abdominal CAT scan on
[**2180-5-8**] to evaluate for abdominal pain and no obvious source
was found.

She was transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit again
on [**2180-5-9**] for management of fall in hematocrit which had
fallen to 22.  She also had significant abdominal pain and
was oliguric (in acute renal failure).  The source of the
abdominal pain was not clear although it could have come from
bowel ischemia or infarction, especially given that she had
had hypotensive episodes while in the hospital and in
addition has artificial heart valve but was sometimes
subtherapeutic on anticoagulation because of concerns of
exacerbating her bleeding.  Given her overall poor quality of
life at the baseline, the patient elected that she would like
to be comfort measures only.  Therefore, she received
Morphine as needed for her abdominal pain and she passed away
on [**2180-5-12**].  Of note, her blood cultures drawn [**2180-5-9**] did
reveal Methicillin resistant staph aureus for which
Vancomycin was started.  It was unknown what the source of
these bacteria were.
