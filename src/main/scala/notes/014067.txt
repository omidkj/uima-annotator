Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5893**]
Chief Complaint:
Febrile neutropenia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Bedside Laparotomy [**2150-7-31**]

History of Present Illness:
 Mrs. [**Known lastname 8271**] is a 62-year-old woman w/ biphenotypic leukemia
s/p Hyper CVAD therapy,MEC, Clofarabine/ARA-C,
Fludarabine/Busulfan/ATG and allogneic SCT day +84 c/b
mucositis,previous febrile neutropenia, ARF, basilar vein
infective thrombosis s/p basilic vein phlebectomy, ascending
neuropathy, and coag negative staph bacteremia p/w fevers since
the evening prior to presentation.
The patient lives across the street from [**Hospital1 18**] in the [**Hospital1 1426**]
Apartments with her husband. She states she was feeling well
until the evening prior to presentation, when she began to feel
warm and have shaking chills. She took her temperature the
morning of presentation and noticed it was 101.5 Additionally,
the pt. states she felt very fatigued, not her "usual self" for
the last 24 hours. Her energy level has been low and she hasn't
been able to ambulate as much as she usually does. She denies
overt sick contacts, although she thinks her husband has been
developing a head cold over the last several days. She has been
easting and drinking well. The only other symptoms she has is
pain near the site of her Hickman, about 2 cm below the
insertion site. She denied any other associated symptoms,
including chest pain, shorteness of breath, cough, nausea,
vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, syncope, extremity pain,
dysphagia/odynophagia, dysuria, or new rash. The pt. does report
lower extremeity swelling, but that it has been chronic and
looks about the same.
.
.
Mrs.[**Doctor Last Name 99082**] has had a profound hospital course over the last
8 months.
She was first seen for a pancytopenia in [**9-/2149**] and ultimately
diagnosed with biphenotypic leukemia in [**11-10**], now s/p allogenic
stem cell transplant [**4-29**], now day 84 (on [**7-22**]). Her
posttransplant course was complicated by severe mucositis
requiring TPN and PCA narcotics as well as coag-negative staph
bacteremia, which was treated with
vancomycin from [**2150-5-9**] through [**2150-5-23**]. She has
unfortunately required four admissions post-transplant due to
nausea, vomiting, and increased creatinine. She underwent an
endoscopy on [**2150-6-5**], which did not show any abnormalities.
Another admission was on [**2150-6-14**] for some increased diarrhea
overnight and vomiting. She was discharged on [**2150-6-16**] and was
seen daily for IV fluids and electrolyte support.
.
Her last admission was on [**7-3**] for increasing weakness and
numbness of her legs. This has increased considerably since her

transplant. Her Tacrolimus and Dapsone were held on admission
due
to concern for contribution to neuropathy. Her initial LP was
negative for evidence of leukemic involvement or bacterial
infection; [**Date Range 18617**] serologies were negative for EBV, HHV6, HSV,
CMV, and [**Male First Name (un) 2326**] virus. Her TSH was normal, Vit B12 low (227), which
was repleted with 1000mcg IM x5 doses (5th dose 6/29), then
planned for monthly thereafter. MMA was later found to be
normal. Pt was evaluated by neurology, who thought that her
neuropathy could be due to the B12 but unlikely given rapid
presentation. She had an MRI spine that was negative for cord
compromise. Anti-[**Doctor Last Name **] antibodies are still pending. Given her
rapid improvement in syx, the neuropathy was attributed to the
Tacrolimus. She received one dose of IVIg on [**6-28**], without
incident. Her symptoms stabilized with continued decreased
sensation in her feet, legs, and chest up to her breast
bilaterally. Pt was evaluated and worked with PT to help with
stability of gait. Pt was ischarged to the apartments with
follow-up with outpt PT, and to be using wheelchair at home. She
was seen in outpt. neurology who eccommended a EMG, which the
pt. declined as she does not feel it would change managment of
her neurolgoical symptoms.
.
.
On admission to the floor, the pt. is in no acute distress an
afebrile. VS are 100(po), 120/82, 96, 20, 97%on RA. She has
complaints of general fatigue. [**Month/Year (2) 24895**], has chronic
complaints of "no proprioception" in her lower extremities,
chronic LE swelling, and pain near her Hickman. No other
complaings.
.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: per HPI. rest is negative.

Past Medical History:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 8271**] is a 62-year-old woman
who was noted to have a pancytopenia [**9-/2149**] and ultimately
diagnosed with biphenotypic leukemia.  She was treated with
hyper-CVAD part A and B with unfortunately bone marrow biopsy
remaining positive.  She then received a cycle of MEC.  Her bone
marrow continued to show up blasts, and she was treated by a
cycle of clofarabine and ARC, resulting in an empty marrow
without evidence of leukemia.  This cycle of treatment was
complicated by high-grade VRE bacteremia and coag-negative staph
bacteremia in the setting of neutropenia.  She was noted to have
septic thrombophlebitis and required intubation and ICU support.

Blood cultures were positive until she underwent right basilic
venectomy and two granulocyte transfusions.  After the clot was
removed, cultures became negative, and she completed a four-week
course of daptomycin in the setting of her sepsis.  Mrs. [**Known lastname 8271**]
also developed ATN and ultimately anuric renal failure, became
dialysis dependent, but after two to three weeks, began making
urine and currently has a normal creatinine without the need for
dialysis.  Bone marrow biopsy done on [**2150-4-2**] showed a
hypercellular marrow for age with erythroid hyperplasia.  There
were no morphologic features of residual or recurrent leukemia
seen.  She had an unrelated donor, and she was admitted for
ablative allogeneic stem cell transplant with
busulfan/fludarabine conditioning on [**2150-4-23**] with day zero on
[**2150-4-29**].

Ms. [**Known lastname 13290**] posttransplant course was complicated by severe
mucositis requiring TPN and PCA narcotics as well as
coag-negative staph bacteremia, which was treated with
vancomycin
from [**2150-5-9**] through [**2150-5-23**].  She has unfortunately
required four admissions post-transplant due to nausea,
vomiting,
and increased creatinine.  She underwent an endoscopy on
[**2150-6-5**], which did not show any abnormalities.  Her most
recent admission was on [**2150-6-14**] for some increased diarrhea
overnight and vomiting.  She was discharged on [**2150-6-16**] and
has
been seen daily for IV fluids and electrolyte support.
