Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 824**]
Chief Complaint:
nephrolithiasis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cystoscopy, right ureteroscopy, laser lithotripsy, stent
placement.


History of Present Illness:
76 year old woman with a history of COPD, OSA, HTN/HL, who
presented today for a scheduled outpatient staged ureteroscopy
with laser lithotripsy of right UPJ stone, who was transferred
to the ICU for acute onset of tachypnea following the procedure
today.

Patient reports she has had progressively worsening shortness of
breath over the past year.  She is only able to walk 10 steps
before she is out of breath.  She reports associated
lightheadedness but denies chest pain/pressure.  She denies a
known diagnosis of COPD, however, has been placed on several
inhalers in the last year to suggest that she carries this
diagnosis (spiriva/symbicort/singulair/ prn albuterol).  She
does not wear oxygen at home, but does have a home CPAP machine
for OSA.  She reports that her machine broke 2 months ago so she
has not used it recently.  At home she sleeps in a lounge chair,
and becomes short of breath when laying flat.

On [**2184-11-2**] she presented for part 2 of a staged ureteroscopy
with lithotripsy to remove the remaining [**11-24**] of her right UPJ
stone.  Part 1 of this procedure took place on [**2184-10-19**] without
complications and patient was discharged home on the same day.
Patient tolerated the procedure today without issue.  She was
noted to be hypertensive to 180s intraoperatively with ST
depressions but was otherwise hemodynamically stable.  Following
the procedure, ECG showed ST depressions in V3-V5.  She had a
set of cardiac enzymes which were negative.  While in the PACU,
she became acutely tachypneic requiring increasing oxygen
requirement.  On exam, she had bilateral inspiratory and
expiratory wheezes and was given lasix 20mg IV and albuterol
nebulizer x 2 with transient improvement in symptoms.  She was
also given 0.5mg ativan for anxiety and 5mg IV labetolol for
hypertension.  As she had ongoing tachypnea with rates in the
30s, sat'ing 95% on NRB but desat'ing to <90% on 6L face mask,
and febrile to 102.7, patient was transferred to the ICU for
further management.

On arrival to the ICU, patient's vital signs were T101.8 P86 BP
127/42 RR 23 O2Saat 99% on NRB.  She was changed to 6L NC and
continued to sat in the high 90s.  She had audible wheezing and
mild accessory muscle use which improved with time.

Shortly after arrival, patient became hypotensive to 80-90s.
Her UOP decreased and she continued to be febrile up to 102.
However, she was asymptomatic.

Imaging:
CXR [**2184-11-2**]- AP chest compared to most recent prior chest
radiograph [**2182-6-23**]: Moderate cardiomegaly has increased.
Pulmonary vascular engorgement and mediastinal fullness in the
right lower paratracheal station could represent early cardiac
decompensation, there may be very mild interstitial pulmonary
edema. There is no indication of appreciable pleural effusion
and no pneumothorax.

Transthoracic echocardiogram [**2184-11-3**]- The left atrium is mildly
dilated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy
with normal cavity size. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a
focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). The
estimated cardiac index is normal (>=2.5L/min/m2). There is a
mild resting left ventricular outflow tract obstruction. The
right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with normal free wall
contractility. The diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending
and arch levels are normal. The number of aortic valve leaflets
cannot be determined. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly
thickened (?#). There is no valvular aortic stenosis. The
increased transaortic velocity is likely related to high cardiac
output. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are structurally normal. Mild-to-moderate mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
    IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global biventricular
systolic function. Mild right ventricular dilation. Mild to
moderate mitral regurgitation. Mild pulmonary hypertension.
    Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of
[**2182-6-21**], there is more mitral regurgitation. The right
ventricle appears mildly dilated.
