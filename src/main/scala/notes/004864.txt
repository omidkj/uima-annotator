HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient had a headache five
days prior to admission with positive emesis.  He went to
[**Hospital **] Hospital on [**2105-10-15**], because the headache
persisted, and he had another episode of emesis.  The patient
had a head CT at [**Hospital **] Hospital which showed a subarachnoid
[**Hospital1 **] [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] for further treatment.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Benign.

ALLERGIES:  NO KNOWN DRUG ALLERGIES.

MEDICATIONS:  None.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  General:  The patient was awake,
alert, and oriented times three.  Speech was fluent.  He
followed 3 out of 3-step commands.  Cranial nerve:  He did
have a positive 7th nerve palsy with left ptosis of the eye.
Pupils were 3 down to 2 mm bilaterally.  Extraocular muscles
were full.  Smile was equal.  Tongue was midline.  He had no
drift.  He had 5 out of 5 strength in both IPs.

LABORATORY DATA:  Sodium 129, potassium 3.2, chloride 100,
CO2 23, BUN 20, creatinine 0.9, glucose 109; white count
12.3, hematocrit 44.6, platelet count 288; coags 13.8, 1.3.

CT scan and CTA of the brain showed right ACA aneurysm and
subarachnoid hemorrhage.  On [**2105-10-16**], the patient
had an arteriogram which showed left A1-A2 ruptured aneurysm.
The patient had endovascular coiling done of the aneurysm
without complication.

Postprocedure the patient was arousable, inconsistently
attentive, following commands inconsistently, and moving all
extremities.  The patient had a head CT which showed the
presence of hydrocephalus.  The patient had a vent drain
placed on [**2105-10-16**].  On [**2105-10-17**], the patient
spike a temperature to 103??????.  The patient was on Kefzol for
prophylaxis of vent drain coverage.  The patient was fully
cultured.  The patient had a chest x-ray which showed no
evidence of infiltrates.  Neurologically the patient was
arousable, perseverating, moving all extremities
spontaneously, but impersistent with following commands,
opening eyes, the right more then the left.  Ptosis was
unchanged.  Pupils were 4 mm bilaterally.
The patient was maintained in the Neurology Intensive Care
Unit and maintained on triple-H therapy to prevent vasospasm.
The patient was sleepy but arousable.  He continued with the
left ptosis and was inconsistently following commands.  The
patient had persistent fevers as high as 104?????? with negative
cultures.  White count was 12.6.  Neurologically the patient
was persistently confused, intermittently attentive, moving
all extremities, and continued with the left ptosis.  He had
no drift.

The patient was intermittently on Neo-Synephrine drip to keep
his blood pressure greater than 160.  The patient was fully
cultured on [**2105-10-18**].  Blood, urine and CSF were all
negative.  CSF on the 16th was negative.  Blood, urine, and
CSF on the 13th were also negative.  The patient's sodium
dropped to 129.  The patient was started on 3% saline drip.

The patient had a repeat chest x-ray on [**2105-10-27**],
that was within normal limits.  The patient spiked a
temperature to 101.4?????? and again was fully cultured, and again
all cultures came back negative.  On [**2105-10-28**], the
patient was awake and alert, oriented times two.  His
repetition was impaired.  He was following one-step commands.
Pupils were left at 7-5; the right [**7-9**].  EOMs were full.  He
had no drift.  His IPs were 5 out of 5.  His naming was
intact to frequently seen items.

The patient's ventricular drain was discontinued on [**2105-10-30**].  On [**10-31**] the patient was somnolent.  His head CT
showed mild hydrocephalus.  The patient had an LP done.
Opening pressure was 25.4.  Closing pressure was 10.2, and 20
cc of CSF was drained off.  CSF sent from the LP on [**2105-10-31**], showed 825 white cells in tube #1, and [**2054**] white
cells in tube #4.  He continued to be xanthochromic.  The
patient was tapped again on [**2105-11-1**], with an opening
pressure of 31 and closing pressure of 5.  The patient had 18
cc of pink, slightly cloudy CSF drained off.  The continued
on 3% saline.  Sodium continued to be low at 133.  The
patient was with increased somnolence requiring daily LPs.
The patient was tapped again on [**2105-11-2**], with an
opening pressure of 26.  The patient was started on
Vancomycin and Ceftriaxone for a question of CSF infection
due to the high white count in the CSF fluid.

On [**11-4**], his LP showed 340 white cells in tube #1 and
350 in tube #4.  Gram-stain was negative, and all CSF
cultures were negative to date.  He continued to have waxing
and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] mental status with periods of somnolence and then
more awake after having an LP done.  The patient was followed
by physical therapy and Occupational Therapy, and he was felt
to require a rehabilitation stay prior to discharge home.


On [**2105-11-5**], the patient had a an episode of
desaturation with diaphoresis.  An electrocardiogram showed
signs of pulmonary embolism.  The patient had a CTA which
confirmed the presence of pulmonary embolism.  CTA confirmed
the presence of right lower lobe artery clot.  The patient
was started on Heparin and transferred to the Intensive Care
Unit for close monitoring.  The patient remained in the
Intensive Care Unit for 24 hours and was then transferred to
the regular floor.

The patient remained on intravenous heparin until IVC filter
was placed.  The patient was felt to be at high risk for
falls, and long-term Coumadin treatment was not an option.
The patient had an IVC filter placed for that reason.  The
patient had an IVC filter placed on [**2105-11-11**].  On
[**11-11**], the patient also complained of left-sided chest
pain.  Electrocardiogram was unchanged.  CPKs were cycled
which were negative.

The patient had intermittent LPs done over the next several
days and was felt to require a permanent VP shunt placement.
The patient had this done on [**2105-11-20**], without
complication.  Postoperatively the patient was more awake,
alert, oriented and following commands.  He was oriented only
to himself and was otherwise still confused.  He was moving
all extremities strongly.  He had no drift.  The patient's
dressing was clean, dry and intact from his shunt.  He should
have staples removed on postoperative day #10 which will be
[**2105-11-30**].  He will follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1132**] with
repeat angiogram in two months and follow-up appointment with
him in one month.
