Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7651**]
Chief Complaint:
weakness

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 97194**] is an 89 year-old man with a history of CHF (EF 30%,
NYHA class III), CAD s/p CABG and recent PCI, and atrial
fibrillation, admitted with hypotension. He has had several
recent extended admissions at this hospital. Most recently, he
was admitted [**10-15**] - [**10-20**] after a fall when he was found to have
a bloody R effusion (Hct 2%). This was tapped, but fluid
immediately reaccumulated. He was then re-admitted [**10-22**] - [**11-2**]
for CHF and NSTEMI with PCI. At that time part of his hypoxia
was thought to be due to his reaccumulated effusion, and it was
again tapped, removing 1.5 L of blood-tinged sputum. His
symptoms improved, and he was discharged on increased dose of
diuretics. He has remained quite frail with a poor functional
status, using a walker but unable to get far due to shortness of
breath. His wife (25 years younger) meticulously cares for him
including 6 cup daily fluid restriction. He followed up with Dr.
[**First Name (STitle) 437**] on [**11-7**], and spironolactone was added to his regimen. His
blood pressure at home has been mostly 110s but sometimes as low
as 90. For this reason his wife seldom gives his valsartan.
.
Because of recurrent R effusion, he underwent large volume (2600
cc) thoracentesis in [**Hospital **] clinic. The procedure was stopped due to
low pressures, but the patient was asymptomatic. CXR showed a
well-expanded lung and a small pneumothorax that was thought to
be clinically insignificant.
.
Mr. [**Known lastname 97194**] was feeling better after the procedure, less short
of breath. However, this morning his wife found him very weak
and unable to climb the stairs as he usually does. She took his
blood pressure and it was >100. However, he seemed very weak and
not himself so he brought her to the ED.
.
In the ED, initial VS: 96.8 92 86/42 24 100% 3L RA. CXR was
concerning for pneumonia. He was given vancomycin and
levofloxacin. IP wanted to keep him dry, but he was given 1 L NS
for low urine output. SBP 100 lying, 80 sitting. EKG was similar
to prior.
VS prior to transfer: HR 63, BP 101/46, RR 16, O2 100% on 2L

EKG [**2157-11-12**] 8:52AM
Atrial fibrillation. Left axis deviation. Left ventricular
hypertrophy with secondary repolarization abnormality. Compared
to the previous tracing
of [**2157-10-28**] no diagnostic interim change.

EKG [**2157-11-12**] 4:45PM
Underlying rhythm is probably sinus, although baseline artifact
makes this
difficult to determine. Premature ventricular contractions and
premature
atrial contractions are probably present. Possible prior septal
myocardial
infarction, age undetermined.

CXR [**2157-11-12**]
IMPRESSION:
1. Tiny right apical pneumothorax.
2. New right lower lung opacity concerning for
asymmetric/reexpansion
pulmonary edema vs pneumonia.
3. Bilateral small-to-moderate pleural effusions with associated
compressive atelectasis.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 97194**] is an 89y/o man with an extensive cardiac history
including chronic systolic CHF (last EF 30%), CAD s/p CABG in
[**2149**], last PCI in [**10/2157**] with [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 5175**] to LIMA, Afib not
on coumadin and recurrent pleural effusions s/p recent large
volume thoracentesis, who presented with hypotension and
weakness in the setting of increased diuretic regimen.
.
ACTIVE ISSUES:
.
# Hypotension: Was likely related to large volume thoracentesis
on [**11-11**], hypovolemia from being NPO and poor PO intake since
last discharge, strict 6 cup fluid restriction, and recent
change and titration up of diuretics and antihypertensive
regimen.  He would clearly benefit from Spironolactone and
Valsartan but his BP does not tolerate these medications.  He
was discharged on a less aggressive BP/CHF regimen: stopped
Valsartan, stopped Spironolactone.  I addition, Tamsulosin was
stopped (he had no trouble urinating).  He will continue on his
home dose of Torsemide and Sotalol.  He has close follow-up with
his PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] will also follow up in Heart Failure clinic.
.
# Chronic systolic CHF: last EF 30% on [**9-/2157**] TTE, NYHA class
III. No evidence of overload now. Effusions most likely due to
CHF.  Patient would [**Doctor Last Name **] benefit from Spironolactone but does
not seem to tolerate.  He will follow up in Heart Failure
clinic.  In addition, he has Pulmonology follow-up to see if the
effusions have resolved.
.
# Atrial fibrillation: he was rate controlled (60-80).  He
declines coumadin at home.  He was continued on Sotalol.
.
# Coronary artery disease: Troponin was stable at .03 x3, most
likely demand ischemia in the setting of hypotension, less
likely [**2-8**] atrial stretch given no evidence of overload. Last
cath [**10/2157**] with [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 5175**].  He was continued on ASA 325
and plavix 75.
.
INACTIVE ISSUES:
.
# Hyperlipidemia: stable.  He was continued on simvastatin.
.
# Anemia: Hct remained near 30, similar to baseline.
.
# BPH s/p TURP: holding Tamsulosin due to low
BP/lightheadedness, but hehad no trouble urinating.
.
#. GERD: stable. Continue Omeprazole.
.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
.
#. Goals of Care: Unfortunately, the patient has been readmitted
frequently to the hospital; this time it was because of
asymptomatic low SBP readings.  In discussions with Mr. and Mrs.
[**Known lastname 97194**], it was clear that they understand the prognosis of
advanced heart failure, especially in the setting of needing to
cut back on medications such as Spironolactone that would
benefit him in the long run.  They declined a discussion about
goals of care, but
