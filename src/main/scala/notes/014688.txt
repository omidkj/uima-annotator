Pertinent Results:
CXR: patchy bibasilar opacities
AXR: no free air

ECG:NSR 80s peaked T waves

Echo:  Conclusions:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity  size, and systolic function are normal
(LVEF>55%). Regional left ventricular  wall motion is normal.
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are  normal.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis  is not present. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial mitral
regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic
shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may be
significantly
UNDERestimated.] There is mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension.  Significant pulmonic regurgitation is seen. There
is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Mild aortic valve sclerosis. Preserved global and
regional  biventricular systolic function. No 2D echo evidence
for endocarditis  identified.
Compared with the prior study (tape reviewed) of [**2159-9-3**], the
findings are  similar.

RADIOLOGY  Final Report

ABDOMEN (SUPINE ONLY)  [**2159-11-16**] 1:33 PM

ABDOMEN (SUPINE ONLY)

Reason: assess for obstruction

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
47 year old woman with vomiting
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
assess for obstruction

CLINICAL HISTORY: 47 y/o female with vomiting.

TECHNIQUE: Supine view of the abdomen.

FINDINGS: Right femoral central venous catheter terminates in
the IVC. No free air is identified in this supine film. There is
a nonspecific but nonobstructed bowel gas pattern. Extensive
vascular calcifications are noted in the region of the kidneys
bilaterally. Osseous structures are unremarkable.

IMPRESSION: No evidence of obstruction or free air.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

CT 100CC NON IONIC CONTRAST  [**2159-11-16**] 1:29 PM

CTA CHEST W&W/O C &RECONS; CT 100CC NON IONIC CONTRAST

Reason: r/o PE
Contrast: OPTIRAY

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
47 year old woman with hypoxia and cough and vomiting. no clear
source of hypoxia on cxr. h/o dvt. is off her anticoagulants
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
r/o PE
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.

CLINICAL HISTORY: A 47-year-old female with hypoxia and cough.

TECHNIQUE: Contiguous axial images of the chest were obtained
prior to and following the administration of 100 cc Obturay.
Non-ionic contrast was used due to patient debility.

Multiplanar reformatted images were created.

COMPARISON: None available.

CT OF CHEST: The opacified pulmonary arterial tree does not
demonstrate any filling defects indicative of pulmonary embolus
to the level of the subsegmental pulmonary arteries. A stent is
noted in the left brachiocephalic vein. The heart and great
vessels otherwise appear grossly normal. Evaluation of lung
fields is limited due to patient respiratory motion. There are
multifocal air space opacities with airbronchograms within the
lingula and left lower lobe. An additional 1.0 x 0.7 cm rounded
opacity in the right upper lobe is noted as well. Several
smaller nodular opacities are present within the right lung.
There are small bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than
left, with associated atelectasis. Bibasilar ground glass
opacities likely represent dependent edema. Limited evaluation
of the upper abdomen is notable for renal atrophy and extensive
vascular calcifications.

IMPRESSION:

1. No pulmonary embolus.
2. Dependent pulmonary edema and
