Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 922**]
Chief Complaint:
Fatigue/Dyspnea on exertion

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2165-6-12**] - 1. Redo, redo sternotomy. 2. Third time aortic valve
replacement with a 19-mm onyx mechanical valve, serial number
[**Serial Number 47966**].
3. Replacement of ascending aorta and hemi arch with a 26-mm
Dacron graft using deep hypothermic circulatory arrest.
[**2165-6-13**] -  Sternal washout and closure with removal of packs.


History of Present Illness:
This 34 year old Hispanic male hemodialysis (on transplant
list) with a history of MSSA aortic valve endocarditis in [**2161**]
is s/p
bioprosthetic aortic valve replacement on [**2161-9-18**] complicated by
a perivalvular abscess requiring homograft valve and aortic root
replacement with reimplantation of coronary arteries on [**2161-9-29**].
He subsequently was treated with a 6 week course of nafcillin
and maintained on dicloxacillin through [**11-24**]. In [**8-25**] he was
treated for what was believed to be recurrent MSSA endocarditis
with 6 weeks of Rifampin and cefazolin and has been on Keflex
indefinitely for suppressive therapy. He was re-admitted
[**2-28**]/-[**3-8**] with fevers
and enterococcal bactermia and was diagnosed with presumed
E.faecalis prosthetic valve endocarditis. TEE at that time
showed
moderate to severe mitral regurgitation (3+), but did not reveal
an abscess and he was hemodynamically stable. The source of his
bacteremia was never found and he was sensitized and started on
ampicillin. He has completed the six week course of Ampicillin
as of [**4-10**] and has been transitioned to levofloxacin for
suppression. He was seen by Infectious Disease in [**2165-3-18**]
after completing his intravenous antibiotics. Given the degree
of valve dysfunction,
surgery was recommended.

Pertinent Results:
[**2165-6-12**] ECHO
PRE BYPASS The left atrium is moderately dilated. The left
atrium is elongated. No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the
body of the left atrium. A patent foramen ovale is present. A
left-to-right shunt across the interatrial septum is
intermittently seen. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are
normal. The left ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. There
is mild to moderate global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF =
40 %). The right ventricle displays focal hypokinesis of the
apical free wall. The rest of the right ventricular segments
display mild to moderate hypokinesis. There are simple atheroma
in the descending thoracic aorta. The number of aortic valve
leaflets cannot be determined. The aortic valve is not well
seen. There is a small vegetation on the aortic valve. There is
mild aortic valve stenosis (valve area 1.2 cm2). Severe (4+)
aortic regurgitation is seen. The aortic regurgitation jet is
eccentric, directed toward the anterior mitral leaflet. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 914**] was notified in person of the
results in the operating room at the time of the study.

POST BYPASS The patient is receiving epinephrine and nor
epinephrine by infusion. Biventricular systolic function is
improved. Left ventricular ejection fraction is in the 50 to 55%
range. There is a bileaflet prosthesis in the aortic position.
It appears well seated. Both leaflets can be seen opening and
closing. There is mild valvular aortic regurgitation which
appears to represent the normal "washing" jets associated with
this valve. No perivalvular regurgitation is appreciated but a
small jet can not be completely ruled out. The maximum gradient
across the valve was measured at 71 mmHg with a mean gradient of
53 mmHg at a cardiac output of about 7.5 liters/minute. The
effective orifice area is about 1.25 cm2. The gradients are
higher and the effective area lower than would be expected for
this valve but a definitive cause can not be ascertained. The
mitral regurgitation is now trace. The thoracic aorta appears
intact. All of these findings were discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 914**] in
the operating room at the time of the study.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 11041**] was admitted to  [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2165-6-12**] for surgical
management of his aortic valve disease. He was taken directly to
the Operating Room where he underwent a redo, redo sternotomy
with replacement of his aortic valve using a 19mm Onyx
mechanical valve and replacement of his ascending aorta and
hemiarch. He required multiple blood products and alarge amount
of fluid. Given this, his chest was packed and left open over
night. His coagulopathy was corrected and on [**2165-6-13**], he
returned to the Operating Room where he underwent sternal
washout with chest closure. He was again taken to the Intensive
C
