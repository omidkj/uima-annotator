Brief Hospital Course:
67M w/ hx metastatic lung cancer, COPD, erosive gastritis who
presented with diarrhea and GI bleed with admission Hct of 19.
He was initially admitted to the ICU for close monitoring,
during which time he was transfused 2 units of pRBCs. He
remained hemodynamically stable. GI was consulted who planned to
complete an EGD. However as the day progressed, patient became
increasingly hypotensive with sBPs in 60s. Vascular surgery
consulted for concern aortoenteric fistula. Patient became too
unstable to CT scan. Plan was made to pursue EGD more urgently
to rule out upper GI bleed. Patient was intubated in preparation
of EGD. Prior EGD, family meeting was held to explain the
patient's poor condition. After speaking to the HCP, he was kelp
full code until she could arrive to be at this bedside Just
prior to EGD, patient's BPs dropped and he ultimately went
pulseless. Resuscitative measures were initiated with chest
compressions. Patient received 1mg of epinephrine and ROSC was
established. Massive transfusion protocol was commensed. He then
remained on maximal BP support and was started on epinephrine
gtt. He remained profoundly hypotensive despite maximal
vasopressor support and massive transfusion. Family meeting was
held and focus was shifted to comfort oriented care. Patient
passed on [**2180-8-21**] at 2145. Family declined autopsy.
