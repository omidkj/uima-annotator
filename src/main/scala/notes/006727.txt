History of Present Illness:
51 year old male with Crohn's disease and short gut syndrome on
chronic TPN with h/o multiple line infections, presented to the
ED with dyspnea. He was in his USOH until the middle of last
week when he developed URI symptoms, including nasal congestion
and dry cough. On the night of [**8-28**], he developed dyspnea and
worsening cough. He had no fever or chills at home. He denies
sputum production, nausea, vomiting, increased ostomy output,
abdominal pain, headache, rash, urinary symptoms. He states he
has had normal po fluid and food intake. He denies change in
urine output or color. He has noticed to blood or black output
from his ostomy. ROS positive for some back pain and myalgias.

In the ED, vital signs on presentation were T 102.9, HR 90, BP
123/53, RR 24, O2sat 95% RA. On exam, he was noted to be
tachypneic but in NAD, bilateral wheezes, and warm extremities.
His Tmax in the ED was 103.3. His BP subsequently dropped to
83/54, and increased to 100/56 after 4L NS. He was also placed
on 4L O2, O2sat 94%. He was subsequently placed on NRB. Blood
cultures were sent and CXR and ECG were performed. He received a
total of 5L NS, vancomycin 1g IV, levofloxacin 500mg IV,
ibuprofen 800mg po, Tylenol 1g, and morphine 1mg IV. Vascular
Surgery was contact[**Name (NI) **] for removal of his R portacath, which was
placed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 519**] in [**5-2**].

Mr. [**Known lastname **] was initially admitted to the MICU for further
management. On arrival to the MICU, he denied shortness of
breath, chest pain, chills, back pain, nausea or vomiting. He
stated that his symptoms did not feel similar to past line
infections, as they usually manifest with fever and rigors
immediately after infusion into the line.

.
IMAGING:
ECG: NSR @ 95bpm, normal axis and intervals, some Twave
flattening in III/aVF, no significant change from prior study in
[**3-2**].
.
CXR:
1) Right middle lobe and left lower lung zone opacities,
suspicious for pneumonia.
2) Right middle lobe bronchiectasis.
3) Bilateral pleural effusions.
.
[**2158-8-30**] CT L-spine
No evidence of epidural abscess or vertebral osteomyelitis.
Congenital dysmorphic appearance of upper cervical vertebrae and
occipital bone.
.
[**2158-9-2**] CT CHEST W/ CONTRAST: 1. Diffuse and patchy
ground-glass opacities seen throughout all segments of the
lungs, more severely involving the upper lobes than the lower
lobes, with some nodular components. These findings are
consistent with multifocal pneumonia. No cavitating nodules are
seen. 2. No evidence of pulmonary embolism. 3. Splenomegaly,
which appears more pronounced than on the prior examination. 4.
PICC extends into the neck, although it curls back inferiorly,
with the tip facing a caudal direction. On subsequent
fluoroscopic spot images, the catheter is seen to be
appropriately repositioned by the CVIR service.
.
[**2159-9-5**] TEE: No evidence of endocarditis.

Brief Hospital Course:
In the MICU, Mr. [**Known lastname **] became increasing dyspnic and hypoxic
secondary to volume overload from aggressive hydration. However,
he improved with diuresis. He was treated with vancomycin for
presumed Portacath infection and possible bacteremia. His
Portacath was removed by Vascular surgery on [**2158-8-29**]. Blood and
PAC tip cultures eventually grew coagulase negative staph in 4
of 4 bottles and he was continued on vancomycin. His respiratory
status improved such that he maintained his oxygen saturation on
2 liters nasal canula. His back pain was concerning initially
for osteomyelitis, but it resolved, thus no additional imaging
studies were pursued.

His chest radiograph and symptoms were concerning for multilobar
pneumonia. Given his history of septic pulmonary emboli, without
documented endocarditis, a TTE and TEE were both performed but
negative. Vancomycin and levofloxacin were used for antibiotic
coverage. He did not require oxygen at discharge.

Mr. [**Known lastname **] was noted to have a microcytic anemia and was without
any evidence of bleeding. Stool guiac was negative. B12 and
folate levels were normal. Iron was found to be low, so
nutritional supplementation was initiated. He was also noted to
be chronically thrombocytopenic and found to have a postive
heparin antibody test. He reported that he had been using
heparin products to flush his PAC at home. All heparin products
were discontinued on this admission.

For his short gut syndrome, ostomy output was monitored and
reported to be at baseline. A PICC line was placed and TPN was
initiated wh
