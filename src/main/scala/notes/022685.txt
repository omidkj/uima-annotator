HI[**Last Name (STitle) 2710**]OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 73 year-old Chinese
speaking man with known three vessel coronary artery disease
status post a and inferior wall myocardial infarction on
[**2115-2-20**] who was scheduled for a coronary artery bypass
graft by Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] for [**2115-3-13**].  The patient was
at home in his usual state of health when he developed
worsening shortness of breath and dyspnea on exertion.  This
worsened over the next several days and the patient then
presented to [**Hospital3 1280**] Emergency Room [**2115-3-9**] where
he was found to be in congestive heart failure.  The patient
was diuresed and was also found to be in sinus bradycardia
requiring atropine.  His Amiodarone, atenolol and Coumadin
were then held at that time.  His INR was 6.99, creatinine
1.4 with a baseline to 1.1.  He was ruled out for myocardial
infarction by enzymes.  He was stabilized at [**Hospital3 1280**] and
then transferred to [**Hospital1 69**] for
a coronary artery bypass graft with Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) **].

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient underwent coronary artery
bypass grafting [**2115-3-18**].  That was a coronary artery
bypass grafting times five, left internal mammary artery to
the left anterior descending, saphenous vein graft to obtuse
marginal two and diagonal one sequential, saphenous vein
graft to diagonal two and saphenous vein graft to the
posterior descending coronary artery.  The patient arrived
into the CSRU on Propofol and on and off nitroglycerin and
neo-synephrine.

Postoperative day one events over the last 24 hours included
a low hematocrit of 23 for which he was transfused one unit
of packed red blood cells.  Vital signs were stable.  Heart
rate 88 being AV paced with an output of 4.36, index of 2.47.
The patient was making good urine.  Chest tubes put out a
total of 345, 245 in the last shift.  On physical examination
the patient was awake and alert.  Heart was regular rate and
rhythm.  Respiratory rate has decreased breath sounds at the
bases.  Abdomen was soft and extremities were warm.  The plan
was to wean from the neo-synephrine, discontinue the Swan and
restart his Amiodarone.  Also start Lasix and to continue
with the transfusion of packed red blood cells.
Postoperative day two the patient was on nitroglycerin and
the Captopril drug as well as yesterday.  The patient's vital
signs are stable aside from his heart rate being in atrial
fibrillation at 111.  On physical examination he was awake,
alert and oriented.  Heart was irregularly irregular.
Sternum was stable.  Lungs were clear to auscultation
bilaterally with decreased breath sounds at the bases.
Abdomen was benign.  Extremities were warm with no edema or
cyanosis.  The plan was to continue the Amiodarone for his
atrial fibrillation, continue Lasix.  His hematocrit was
stable now at 26 and plan was to potentially transfer him to
the floor.

Postoperative day three the patient is back into sinus
rhythm, however, bradycardic, on and off pressors currently
on neo-synephrine, low grade fever of 99.4, heart rate 68
being V paced, hematocrit of 26, white blood cell count 16.9,
sodium 138, potassium 5.4, BUN 16, creatinine 1 with a
glucose of 114.  On physical examination the patient was
awake, however, confused.  Heart was regular rate and rhythm,
however, sometimes in sinus brady.  Lungs had coarse breath
sounds.  No wheezing.  Abdomen was benign.  Extremities were
warm with no edema.  The plan is to Captopril, discontinue
the chest tube and to try to transfer the patient.  EP staff
came and saw the patient on [**3-21**], postoperative day three
for management of his atrial fibrillation.  They found the
patient to be in tachybrady syndrome on Amiodarone that does
not tolerate the atrial fibrillation.  The plan was to place
a permanent pacemaker anywhere between [**3-22**] and [**3-25**].  [**3-22**] the following day EP came by and saw the patient again.
The patient was found to have a white count of 16.9.  His po
temperatures were 97 to 98 and now 99.  The chest x-ray
showed no infiltrate.  They recommended that we check a
urinalysis and a rectal temperature and possible pacemaker
implantation is going to be discussed with the patient's
daughter.

Postoperative day four that same day, the patient continued
to be confused.  He pulled at his [**Last Name (un) 14097**] and he was on and
off pressors and in and out of atrial fibrillation and sinus.
Temperature max of 99.5, heart rate 99 in atrial
fibrillation, white count of 13.6, sodium 138, potassium 3.7,
BUN 19, creatinine 1.2, with a glucose of 107.  On physical
examination the patient was awake and alert.  Heart was
irregularly irregular.  His lungs had coarse breath sounds.
Abdomen was benign as well as the extremities.  The plan was
to have the pacemaker placed today.  He was making good urine
output.  The plan was to discontinue the Foley and to check a
urinalysis and to keep the patient NPO for pacemaker
placement.  EP came by again today.  The patient's
temperature was 100.4 with a white count remaining elevated.
It was discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] who advised to delay the
pacemaker placement until the patient is afebrile for 48
hours.

Postoperative day five [**2115-3-23**] the patient is mildly
confused with a temperature max of 100.4 to a current of
98.6, in sinus rhythm at 64, white count of 9.4, hematocrit
26.4, platelets 190, sodium 139, potassium 2.6, BUN 25,
creatinine 1.4, glucose of 194.  On physical examination the
patient is awake and still mildly confused.  Heart was
regular.  Lungs were clear to auscultation, decreased breath
sounds bibasilarly.  Abdomen benign as well as the
extremities.  The plan is to continue the patient on
Amiodarone and Captopril.  EP came by and saw the patient.
The patient was still V pacing with periods of atrial
fibrillation on Amiodarone, still following with us, however.
They felt that the patient may not require permanent
pacemaker at this time.  EP came back and saw the patient the
following day, which is [**2115-3-24**].  The patient was doing
well and V pacing.  He was afebrile with a white blood cell
count normalized.  They decided the patient should go for a
permanent pacemaker on Monday.  The plan was to keep the
patient NPO after midnight just in case.

The patient underwent permanent pacemaker placement [**2115-3-25**] by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  There were no complications.  EP
recommended that we hold the heparin and Coumadin overnight
keeping the head of the bed at 45 degrees.  If the wound is
okay in the morning then we can start anticoagulation.
Postoperative day seven the patient had an uneventful night.
The day of the pacemaker, he was afebrile in and out of
atrial fibrillation with a current heart rate in sinus at 63,
white count of 9.4, hematocrit of 28.4, platelets 239, sodium
140, potassium 3.7, BUN 24, creatinine 1.1 with a glucose of
128.  On physical examination he is awake, alert and
following commands.  His heart was irregularly irregular.
Lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally.  Abdomen and
extremities were benign.  The plan was to have a permanent
pacemaker placed, which we did that day.

Postoperative day eight [**2115-3-26**] the patient with a low
grade temperature of 99.  His urine output was decreased
overnight.  He was in sinus at 66, vital signs stable.  On
physical examination he was awake, alert and oriented times
three.  Chest incisions were clean, dry and intact.  The
patient's dressing was clean, dry and intact.  Hear
