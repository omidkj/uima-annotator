Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2565**]
Chief Complaint:
Abdominal pain, hypotension --> GI perforation, peritonitis,
sepsis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Bipap (Non-invasive Ventilation)
Central Venous Line (RIJ)

History of Present Illness:
66 yo male with history of alcohol cirrhosis (?c/b ascites/SBP,
varices, encephalopathy), with care at [**Hospital 1474**] Hospital, who
presented to Liver Clinic this morning to establish care (?TIPS
vs. transplant work-up). Complained of abdominal pain (RUQ) and
was found hypotensive to SBP60s. The patient endorsed feeling
weak for the last 1-2 days, may have fallen yesterday. The
patient's wife states he has been more confused recently, with
poor memory but mentating/ conversant. Denies melena or bright
red blood per rectum; denies hematemesis. Of note, the patient
has been taking immodium as he really dislikes lactulose;
reportedly has been having bowel movements fairly regularly.
.
In [**Month (only) **], patient had been admitted to [**Hospital 1474**] Hospital for
a GI bleed. Reportedly, EGD at the time documented varices, the
patient was transfused and had paracenteses. In mid-[**Month (only) 404**], the
patient had a repeat paracentesis. [**2157-3-15**] the patient was
admitted to [**Hospital 1474**] Hospital for variceal bleeding, which was
banded and he was transfused. Also received IV PPI and another
paracentesis. In early [**Month (only) 116**], paracentesis "milky," ?chylous
ascites.
.
In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, initial VS were: T90.0, BP74/29. Patient was
placed on Bear Hugger and volume resuscitated with 3L normal
saline. CXR not suggestive of PNA. Labs showed mild leukocytosis
10.9 w/ bandemia (32%), lactate 6.4, INR 1.9, mild hyponatremia
132, mild hyperkalemia with renal failure Cr 4.5. Paracentesis
with 12,000 WBC and he received Ceftriaxone. With persistent
hypotension, the patient was broadened to Vancomycin and Zosyn.
Given stress dose steroids, home levothyroxine and three more
liters normal saline. Also received octreotide and protonix IV
for concern of GI bleed initially. RIJ placed and levophed
started. The patient was trace guaiac positive and started on
octreotide, IV PPI. Patient intially mentioning that he would
not want to be intubated. On transfer, T33.8, HR77, BP97/48,
RR20, 97% on NRB.
.
ROS: Patient denies shortness of breath, endorses mild pain and
distension in upper abdomen, urinary urgency. Otherwise denies
cough, fevers, diarrhea.

Gram stain: 3+ polys, 1+ rods, 1+ cocci in pairs
.
EKG: Normal sinus rhythm, HR 63, normal axis, QTc 491, biphasic
STs in V3-V6, poor baseline.
.
CXR: Consistent with the given history, a right internal jugular

approach central venous catheter has been placed in the
interval. The distal tip projects over the right heart and takes
the expected course through the superior vena cava. No
pneumothorax is evident. Lung volumes remain markedly diminished
with predominantly linear hazy opacity at the left lung base and
blunting of the left costophrenic angle. Old rib fractures are
identified at multiple levels in the left hemithorax.
.
CT head: No evidence of hemorrhage, large vascular territory
infarction or skull fracture. Essentially normal head CT with
age appropriate atrophy.
.
CT torso:
1. Free air and fluid seen throughout the abdomen. There is a
region of
cecum seen with with possible pneumatosis and abnormal bowel
wall which could represent the source of perforation due to
ischemic colon however the bowel wall cannot be truly
characterized without contrast. It is also possible that this
free air is from duodenal ulcer or alternative bowel
perforation. It is less likely a duodenal ulcer due to the lack
of significant free air seen surrounding the duodenum.
2. There is simple fluid throughout the abdomen. The liver is
cirrhotic thus it is impossible to discern whether the fluid
seen interdigitating throughout the loops of bowel is ascites
from liver failure or fluid from the bowel perforation.
3. Fluid seen distending the esophagus as well as several
ground-glass
opacities within the lung which could be worrisome for
aspiration.
4. Multiple bilateral healed rib fractures with callus
suggesting chronicity. There are multiple compression fractures
noted throughout the thoracolumbar spine whose acuity is age
indeterminate without prior imaging, though morphology suggests
chronicity.


Brief Hospital Course:
66 year old male with history of alcoholic cirrhosis c/b
SBP/varices/encephalopathy, hypertension, hypothyroidism, COPD,
prostate cancer who presents with RUQ abdominal pain,
hypotension, found to have acute abdomen secondary to
perforation (?ischemic colon and duodenal ulcer).
.
#. Hypotension: With hypothermia, altered mental status and poor
urine output most likely sepsis. Known perforation, with
surgical abdomen/peritonitis. In discussions with Transplant
Surgery and Hepatology, the patient and wife (and daughters),
the decision was to not pursue surgery. With a MELD of 27 and
Childs-[**Doctor Last Name 14477**] C score he has a very poor prognosis
peri-operatively. Also has extremely poor prognosis without
surgery. On the first day of hospitalization, antibiotics,
levophed and volume resuscitation (with normal saline and
albumin 25%) were continued. The plan was for no escalation of
care (additional pressors, surgery). The patient was DNR/DNI
with goal of comfort. The patient was switched to face mask from
BiPap for oxygen and his pain controlled with morphine. The
patient's daughters, sisters and other family members visited
him throughout the day. On hospital day 2, the patient's wife
discussed with the family and decision was made to withdraw
care. Antibiotics, levophed were discontinued. The patient was
started on low-dose morphine gtt and ativan boluses PRN for
anxiety, comfort. He became progressively hypotensive,
bradycardic, hypothermic, no urine output. The patient expired
at 2:35pm, two hours afterwards, with family at the bedside.
Autopsy was declined.
.
#. Renal failure: Unclear prior baseline but has known elevated
creatinine as of [**Month (only) 958**]. [**Month (only) 116**] be
