STUDIES:
CXR [**2108-7-31**]:
FINDINGS: Hilar prominence and interstitial opacities likely
reflect a degree of volume overload in the setting of renal
dysfunction. Double-lumen left-sided central venous catheter is
seen with tips at the cavoatrial junction and well within the
right atrium. Cardiac size is top normal with normal
cardiomediastinal silhouette. Unchanged right lung granuloma
again seen.
IMPRESSION: Mild volume overload

EGD [**2108-8-2**]:
Procedure: The procedure, indications, preparation and potential
complications were explained to the patient, who indicated her
understanding and signed the corresponding consent forms. A
physical exam was performed. A physical exam was performed prior
to administering anesthesia. Supplemental oxygen was used. The
patient was placed in the left lateral decubitus position and an
endoscope was introduced through the mouth and advanced under
direct visualization until the second part of the duodenum was
reached. Careful visualization of the upper GI tract was
performed. The vocal cords were visualized. The Z-l
