Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1973**]
Chief Complaint:
Malignant Hypertension

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
39 year-old male with a history of untreated hypertension who
presents with headache, neck pain, dizziness and back pain on
the morning of admission. Notably, the patient was diagnosed
with uncontrolled hypertension when he lived in [**Country 2045**] and was on
nifedipine for this (which he took intermittently). Since coming
to the US several years ago, he has neither seen a medical
doctor nor been on any medications. He states he has
intermittent back and neck pain for several weeks.  Neck pain
was especially bad the morning of admission and associated with
pain on head movement. In the past, he has used Motrin PRN for
this pain but has not taken in at least 1 week.

In the ED, 270/140. Given Labetalol bolus and then started on
labetalol drip and admitted to the ICU for management. Not given
any PO except for 40 KCL mEQ PO x1. He was actually weaned off
of labetlol drip prior to arrival to the floor. On the floor her
received labetelol, HCTZ and norvasc, with highly labile blood
pressures (systolic ranging from 140-190 and diastolic ranging
from 105-120). He remained asymtpomatic. An echocardiogram was
performed with results as below, but given the concern of
coarctation of the aorta, the patient was sent for urgent
MRA-Aortogram, which did not demonstrate coarctation.

Past Medical History:
Hypertension diagnosed in [**Country 2045**] and on medication. Has not taken
medication or been to a physician since emigrating to the US
several yrs ago. No other medical problems, past surgeries or
hospitalization.

Social History:
Denies past drug use. No current EtOH or tobacco use. Social
smoker briefly several yrs ago. Lives with wife, 12 yo daughter
and 1 [**Name2 (NI) **] son. [**Name (NI) 1403**] as a valet at [**Hospital 86**] [**Hospital3 1810**].
Several siblings in [**State 108**] and [**Country 6607**]. No other family members

to have HTN. No FH of CAD, DM, cancer.

ECG Study Date of [**2117-1-4**]  10:39:32 AM

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2117-1-4**] 9:35 AM
FINDINGS: Non-contrast head CT. There is no intra-axial or
extra-axial
hemorrhage, shift of normally midline structures, mass effect,
or evidence of acute infarction. Ventricles and sulci appear
normal for a patient of this age. Basilar cisterns are patent.
Paranasal sinuses, mastoid air cells, and middle ear cavities
are well aerated. The calvarium is intact.
IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial process.


CHEST (PA & LAT) Study Date of [**2117-1-4**] 10:22 AM
IMPRESSION: Mild cardiomegaly with LV configuration. Consider
echocardiogram to further assess.


TTE (Congenital, complete) Done [**2117-1-5**] at 2:51:51 PM
FINAL
The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is moderate symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF
70-80%). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left
ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). There is no left
ventricular outflow obstruction at rest or with Valsalva. There
is no ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size
and free wall motion are normal. The aortic arch is mildly
dilated. The aortic valve is bicuspid (true bicuspid valve with
equal anterior and posterior leaflets). There is a minimally
increased gradient consistent with minimal aortic valve
stenosis. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The aortic
regurgitation jet is eccentric, directed toward the anterior
mitral leaflet. The mitral valve appears structurally normal
with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired
relaxation. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be
determined. There is no pericardial effusion.
Impression: true bicuspid aortic valve with minimal stenosis and
mild regurgitation; moderate concentric left ventricular
hypertrophy with hyperdynamic left ventricle; coarctation of the
aorta could not be excluded on the basis of this study, and
should be strongly considered

DUPLEX DOPP ABD/PEL Study Date of [**2117-1-5**] 8:11 AM
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence for renal artery stenosis by Doppler ultrasound.
2. Increased echogenicity of the renal parenchyma bilaterally
consistent with diffuse parenchymal disease. Normal sized
kidneys.


MRA CHEST W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2117-1-6**] 9:53 AM
IMPRESSION:
1. Normal appearance of the thoracic aorta. No evidence of
aortic
coarctation.
2. Bicuspid aortic valve.
