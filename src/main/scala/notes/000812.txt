Attending:[**Doctor First Name 3290**]
Chief Complaint:
productive cough

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
ORTHOPEDIC:
1. Removal implant deep left fibula.
2. Open biopsy bone deep left medial malleolus
CARDAIC:
Cardiac Catherization ([**10-17**])


History of Present Illness:
Per report patient was in USOH when began experiencing cough
productive of clear sputum with nausea worse than baseline. (She
felt sx were related to left ankle infection; as it was not
chararacteristic of CHF excerbation which includes PND,
orthopnea) Called EMS and admitted to [**Hospital1 34**]. On initial
presentation febrile to 100.1 BP: 80/50, tachycardiac,
leukocytosis to 10.7. Initial CXR: flash pulmonary edema vs PNA.
She was admitted to ICU, initially requiring 100% Fio2, started
on stress dose steriods, IV vanc and levofloxacin 750mg QD and
diuresis with IV lasix 20mg. Notable OSH labs: influenza A and
B: neg, urine legionella neg, urine strep pneum antigen neg.
Urine cx neg. Blood cx positive 2/4 bottles for gram + cocci in
clusters (coag neg staph) - deemed contaminant by ID
(levofloxacin stop date per notes [**10-8**]). Creatinine at time of
transfer: 2.0 (1.4 admission -> 2.0; per renal recs at OSH stop
Lasix). Vancomycin had been stopped and patient continued on
Levofloxacin (750mg IV q48hrs) for atypical PNA vs brochitis
Per report initially hyperglycemic neccisitating insulin gtt on
night of admission b/c of mild DKA which resolved and pt
transitioned to SQ inusulin. Prior to transfer transitioned to
home regime. At time of transfer she was saturating well on 3L
NC, BG controlled.
.
Of note, patient with history of left ankle fracture in
[**2148-10-1**] status post ORIF, c/b complicated by failure of
healing of the medial malleolar wound and medial malleolar
hardware-associated osteomyelitis with coag-negative staph. Drs.
[**Name5 (PTitle) **] ([**Name5 (PTitle) 1957**]), [**Doctor Last Name **] (ID), and [**Last Name (un) 3407**] (vascular) have been
following. She is s/p wash out and 2 courses of prolonged IV
vanco (6weeks) currently on doxycycline suppression therapy
(100mg PO BID). In the last 1-2 weeks (while on doxy), her
infection has returned with increased drainage and tenderness of
medial malleolar wound as well as rising inflammatory markers
(CRP: 3 ->100). Per [**Last Name (un) **] plan is to return to the OR with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] for a repeat wash out in effort to treat this
infection. After she no longer has an infectious source and she
is no longer as deconditioned, then she may be considered for
MVR to prevent her recurrent CHF.
.
On arrival, initial vital signs were 98.8  118/57  87  18  3L
NC. Overall patient in no distress. Reports persistent wet cough
but denies SOB, PND, orthopnea, peripheral edema. Complains of
left ankle pain as well as pain in right hip (at baseline).
Reports abdominal pain, blaoting and minimal nausea (again
baseline sx). Denies any fevers, chills, weight loss or gain.
Denies chest pain, palp. Denies diarrhea, constipation, dysuria.

IMAGING:
.
RENAL US ([**10-8**])
RENAL TRANSPLANT ULTRASOUND: The right lower quadrant renal
transplant is
identified. There is no hydronephrosis or perinephric fluid. The
urinary
bladder is decompressed around a Foley catheter, and therefore
not well
visualized.
DOPPLER EXAMINATION: The main renal artery and vein are patent
with
appropriate waveforms. Resistive indices of the upper, mid, and
lower pole of the transplant kidney are 0.64, 0.71 and 0.60
respectively. Arterial
waveforms are appropriate, with sharp systolic upstrokes and
preserved flow through diastole.
IMPRESSION:
1. Normal renal transplant ultrasound.
2. Normal renal transplant Doppler examination
.
TTE ([**10-10**])
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The estimated right atrial
pressure is 0-5 mmHg. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is mild regional left
ventricular systolic dysfunction with inferolateral hypokinesis.
The remaining segments contract normally (LVEF = 45%). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are
normal. No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. No mass or
vegetation is seen on the mitral valve. Moderate (2+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure
could not be determined. There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: No vegetations seen (adequate-quality study). Mild
regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction, c/w CAD. Normal
global and regional biventricular systolic function. In presence
of high clinical suspicion, absence of vegetations on
transthoracic echocardio
