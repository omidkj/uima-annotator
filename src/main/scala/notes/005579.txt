All subsequent Blood, Urine, Stool cultures negative.

[**2169-4-25**]: RUQ Ultrasound
1. Portal vein is patent. Cirrhosis with moderate
intra-abdominal ascites.
2. Cholelithiasis and gallbladder wall thickening. In the
setting of liver
disease, gallbladder wall thickening can be secondary to
underlying liver
disease.

[**2169-4-25**]: CXR (PA & Lateral)
Bibasilar linear compressive atelectasis and low lung volumes
likely secondary to patient's known intra-abdominal ascites. No
definite
pneumonia or congestive heart failure.

[**2169-4-26**]: HIDA Scan
No evidence of cholecystitis.

[**2169-4-26**]: CTA Abdomen/Pelvis
IMPRESSION:
1. Cirrhosis and portal hypertension with moderate-to-large
volume ascites
and mild splenomegaly. No new focal concerning hepatic lesion.
2. No evidence for mesenteric ischemia or obstruction. While
there is
apparent narrowing at the origin of celiac axis, the remainder
of the celiac axis and mesenteric vasculature appears widely
patent.
3. Gallbladder distention has been present on priors with a few
small
gallbladder stones likely.
4. Diffuse colonic wall thickening most likely reflects third
spacing.

[**2169-4-28**]: TTE
No vegetations seen (good-quality study). Normal global and
regional biventricular systolic function. Mild to moderate
regurgitation. Compared with the prior study (images reviewed)
of [**2169-3-8**], the findings are similar. In presence of high
clinical suspicion, absence of vegetations on transthoracic
echocardiogram does not exclude endocarditis.

[**4-30**] US
1. Marked swelling of the scrotal skin with hypoechoic regions
in both the
right and left hemiscrotum. This may represent fluid from
scrotal
edema/third-spacing, but underlying infection cannot be excluded
(though lack of significant associated vascularity argues
against it).
2. No evidence of epididymo-orchitis.

[**4-30**] CT
1. Marked interval increase in diffuse subcutaneous edema and
slight interval decrease in moderate ascites. No organized fluid
collection identified to suggest abscess.
2. Nodular liver and enlarged spleen consistent with cirrhosis
and portal
hypertension.
3. Diffuse colonic wall thickening likely reflecting third
spacing.
4. Bibasilar airspace disease, likely atelectasis, and a tiny
left pleural
effusion.

[**5-3**] US:
1. Unremarkable scrotal ultrasound with normal appearance of the
testes.
2. Extensive subcutaneous edema unchanged

[**5-4**] US
Left lower quadrant abdominal wall edema, but no sign of abscess

TEE [**5-5**]:
No echocardiographic evidence of endocarditis. The catheter tip
present in the right atrium in close proximity to the tricuspid
valve. Recommend withdrawal of the catheter approximately 2 to 3
centimeters to avoid contact/mechanical irritation of the
tricuspid valve. Aortic atheroma as described above.

[**5-11**] CXR:
Near complete resolution of left lower lobe pneumonia.

[**5-12**] RUE US: No DVT

Brief Hospital Course:
Pleasant 49 yo M with HIV and HCV cirrhosis c/b cirrhosis, who
was admitted with abdominal pain. He was found to have SBP and
GBS bacteremia.
.
# SBP with bactermia- Pt completed 2 week course of ceftriaxone
(ended [**2169-5-10**]). He completed albumin [**4-30**]. TTE and TEE without
evidence of endocarditis. He was started on ciprofloxacin 500mg
daily for SBP prophylaxis on [**2169-5-11**]. He remained afebrile for
24 hours after ceftriaxone was stopped.
.
# Cellulits at paracentesis site - No abscess by US. Pt was
treated with 12 days of vancomycin (completed [**2169-5-10**]) and
cellulitis was resolved at time of discharge. He remained
afebrile for 24 hours after vanco was stopped. He was no longer
requiring pain medications and none were given on discharge.
.
# Scrotal swelling/Anasarca - Pt had extremely swollen scrotum,
which was determined to be an extention of his ascites. With
supportive care (sheet under scrotum) and diuresis, it slowly
improved. US and CT were negative for abcess/fourniers. His goal
diuresis of losing 1 kg/day was achieve with lasix 120mg [**Hospital1 **] and
spironolactone 50mg daily. Weight on discharge was 72.4kg.
.
# Oral herpes - Pt had lesions concerning for oral h
