Physical Exam:
Physical examination in the office (preop [**2114-4-19**]) revealed a
pulse of 74
and regular, respirations of 18, and blood pressure of 160/80.
In general, he was a well-developed and well-nourished elderly
gentleman in no acute distress.  His skin was unremarkable.  His
oropharynx was benign.  Neck was supple with full range of
motion.  There was no JVD.  Lungs were clear to auscultation
bilaterally.  Heart had a regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 and
S2 with a III/VI systolic ejection murmur.  Abdomen was soft,
nontender, and nondistended.  Extremities were warm and well
perfused with 1+edema bilaterally.  His greater saphenous veins
did not display varicosities.  Neurologically, he was alert and
oriented x3.  Cranial nerves II through XII were grossly intact.
He had 5/5 strength and no focal deficits were appreciated.  His

Findings
LEFT ATRIUM: Normal LA size.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Mildly dilated RA.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Severe symmetric LVH. Normal LV cavity size.
Normal regional LV systolic function. Hyperdynamic LVEF >75%.
Estimated cardiac index is normal (>=2.5L/min/m2). TDI E/e' >15,
suggesting PCWP>18mmHg. No resting or Valsalva inducible LVOT
gradient. Apical intracavitary gradient.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTA: Moderately dilated aortic sinus. Moderately dilated
ascending aorta.

AORTIC VALVE: Moderately thickened aortic valve leaflets.
Moderate-severe AS (area 0.8-1.0cm2). Trace AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Normal mitral valve leaflets. Trivial MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets. Mild [1+] TR.
Borderline PA systolic hypertension.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Pulmonic valve not visualized.
No PS. Physiologic PR.

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.
Conclusions
The left atrium is normal in size. There is severe symmetric
left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size
is normal. Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. Left
ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%). The
estimated cardiac index is normal (>=2.5L/min/m2). Tissue
Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling
pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). There is no left ventricular outflow
obstruction at rest or with Valsalva. An apical intracavitary
gradient is identified. Right ventricular chamber size and free
wall motion are normal. The aortic root is moderately dilated at
the sinus level. The ascending aorta is moderately dilated. The
aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is
moderate to severe aortic valve stenosis (area 1.0cm2). Trace
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
structurally normal. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. There
is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is
no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Severe left ventricular hypertrophy with
hyperdynamic systolic function. Moderate to severe aortic
stenosis. Moderately dilated ascending aorta and aortic root.

Brief Hospital Course:
Admitted and went to surgery for Aortic Valve Replacement (#25mm
St.[**Male First Name (un) 923**] Porcine Valve). See operative report for further
details. He was transferred to the CVICU for hemodynamic
monitoring.  In first twenty four hours he was weaned from
sedation, awoke neurologically intact and was extubated without
complications. On postoperative day one he went into Atrial
Fibrillation that was treated with amiodarone and lopressor.
Overnight day 1 into day 2 he had pauses > 10 seconds and
amiodarone was discontinued.  He had no further prolonged pau
