Allergies:
Penicillins / Erythromycin Base

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 545**]
Chief Complaint:
Hypoxia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Ultrasound-guided placement of left pigtail catheter

History of Present Illness:
77F h/o diastolic CHF, CRI, recurrent pleural effusions,
transferred from [**Hospital6 5016**] on [**2115-2-4**] for further w/u
of persistent pleural effusions.  Pt had undergone L
thoracentesis on [**2115-1-30**], which demonstrated nonmalignant
effusions with exudative protein count but otherwise
transudative markers.  After the thoracentesis, pt became
hypoxic on RA, decreasing to 74% with slight improvement after
receivng 2-3L O2 NC.
.
On presentation to the ED after her thoracentesis, pt was
diagnosed with "reexpansion pulmonary edema," placed on BIPAP,
and received levofloxacin but switched to clindamycin on [**1-31**]
due to prolonged QT interval and concomitant sotalol use.
Subsequently, pt appeared to have developed flash pulmonary
edema on [**2-2**] to which she responded to furosemide 40 mg IV with
900 cc urine output, with oxygen saturation 94-95% on 50%
facemask.  She later vomited x2, and then sotalol was held for
QTc 510 ms.
.
Pt was later transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] to undergo pleuroscopy in the
IP suite.  During IP, pt desaturated to mid-70s on 5L NC after
being placed on her R side, and improved to mid-80s with
repositioning.  She was then transferred to the MICU for closer
management, where she was treated with clindamycin for
presumptive asp PNA, and albuterol/ipratropium nebulizers.  A
pigtail catheter was placed to drain L pleural effusion.  CTA PE
was held given elevated creatinine.  Pt's oxygen saturations
stabilized on 1L NC, and pt was transferred to the floor.

Imaging:
.
# OSH CT chest ([**1-30**]): Post left thoracentesis with considerable
edema in the lower half of the left lung felt to be related to
re-expansion. left upper lung and right lung are clear although
chronic changes are present. small amounts of residual bilateral
pleural fluid. less than 10% left sided pneumothorax.
.
# OSH CXR ([**1-31**]): Dense left lower lob infiltrate with patchy
right lower lobe infiltrate, left pleural effusion suspected.
.
# CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2115-2-6**] 5:27 AM
1.  Status post left pigtail catheter placement in left upper
chest with new left-sided pneumothorax at the base.
2.  More severe right-sided pleural effusion.
3.  Stable increased retrocardiac opacity likely representing
compressive atelectasis.
.
# RENAL U.S.  [**2115-2-7**] 3:27 PM: Small, symmetrical kidneys with
thin cortex. No hydronephrosis and no stones or solid masses.
Bilateral pleural effusion.
.
# CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2115-2-10**] 3:04 PM: Bilateral pleural
effusions, slightly increased with the greater portion of the
fluid loculated within the mid lung fields.

Brief Hospital Course:
77F h/o HTN, CRI [**1-5**] hypertensive nephropathy, diastolic CHF,
chronic pleural effusions, transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] from OSH to
undergo pleuroscopy, then transferred to MICU from IP suite
after hypoxia during aborted pleuroscopy, s/p pigtail catheter
to drain L pleural effusion, s/p talc pleurodesis, treated for
aspiration PNA, COPD, and CHF.
.
# Hypoxia: Pt became hypoxic after OSH thoracentesis, and again
later during attempted pleuroscopy at [**Hospital1 18**].  Hypoxia was
considered likely [**1-5**] underlying COPD, volume overload, chronic
pleural effusions, and aspiration PNA given history of vomiting
and report of opacity on CXR at OSH.  Pt was administered
clindamycin for aspiration PNA, and albuterol/ipratropium
nebulizers for COPD.  Pigtail cathether was placed to drain
effusions; L pneumothorax was then also noted, which resolved.
Pt completed clindaymycin x10 days for aspiration pneumonia,
with improvement in her respiratory status.
.
# Pleural effusions: Pt underwent talc pleurodesis at L pleura
per IP, with no further interventions anticipated.
.
# Diastolic CHF: Pt had known significant MR [**First Name (Titles) 151**] [**Last Name (Titles) 61935**] EF.
On transfer to floor from MICU, pt appeared euvolemic, with no
JVD and no peripheral edema.  Pt's home regimen of furosemide 20
mg QOD, lisinopril 40 mg [**Hospital1 **] were continued.
.
# HTN:  Pt was initially continued on home regimen of verapamil
240 mg daily and lisinopril 40mg [**Hospital1 **], and was restarted on
hydralazine 50 mg PO BID per home regimen upon transfer to the
floor.  Given no known h/o ventricular or supraventricular
arrhythmias, as well as development of long QTc, sotalol was
discontinued permanently.  Pt was started on HCTZ and metoprolol
50mg TID, to be uptitrated as an outpatient.
.
# UTI: Pt was noted to have a pan-sensitive E. Coli UTI, and was
started on ciprofloxacin x10 days given Foley instrumentation.
.
# Chronic renal insufficiency: Pt was noted to develop prerenal
ARF [**1-5**] poor PO and overdiuresis; this resolved after adequate
hydration.
.
# Hyperlipidemia: Pt continued on pravastatin 20mg PO daily, and
ASA 81mg daily.
.
# DNR/DNI
