Admission Date:  [**2124-5-9**]       Discharge Date:  [**2124-5-24**]


Service:  VASCULAR

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient was an 88-year-old
male with a history of cerebrovascular disease who presented
with signs and symptoms of peptic ulcer disease, but work-up
revealed the fact that the patient had postprandial abdominal
pain and was ultimately evaluated for mesenteric ischemia.
The patient's symptoms included intermittent abdominal pain,
as well as a description of an episode of diffuse abdominal
pain and "feeling lousy" after meals for the past several
months.  The patient discouraged the patient from eating and
resulted in an [**7-1**] lb weight loss over the prior four months
before admission.  Additionally, the patient noted a drastic
................., as well as an overall abdominal girth.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  He denied nausea or vomiting.  He denied
diarrhea.  No chills.   Per the patient, he never had a [**Last Name 16423**]
problem "with his heart."  He denied history of myocardial
infarction.  No previous echocardiogram data.  No prior
catheterization or rhythm disturbances.  He did state that he
did have stress test long ago and could not remember exactly
what the nature or results of that were.

After being admitted for the work-up of mesenteric ischemia,
he did receive an arteriogram that showed significant
mesenteric vessel disease requiring likely operative
intervention.  Prior to him going to the operating room, he
did get a cardiac consultation.  Cardiology had seen the
patient, and given his multiple comorbidities, they
recommended work-up.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for diabetes times 30
years which is "labile."  Prior history of stroke and
transient ischemic attacks.  History of hypoglycemia from his
diabetes.  Coronary artery disease with prior myocardial
infarction.  History of hypertension.  He denied tobacco.  He
used alcohol occasionally.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  He lived at home.  He worked in a leather
factory.  He repaired televisions and radios as his prior
occupations, but was retired on admission.

q.d., Aspirin 325 mg q.d., Humulin N 15 q.a.m., Ambien 5 mg

2+ dorsalis pedis, 2+ posterior tibial bilaterally.  No
evidence of tissue loss.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted on [**2124-5-9**],
for his mesenteric ischemia work-up.  He did receive a
preoperative carotid ultrasound that revealed no significant
hemodynamic lesions, either on the right or left carotid
bifurcation.  [**Last Name (un) **] consultation was obtained for blood
sugar management while he was in-house.  Ultimately he was
given prehydration Mucomyst for his in-house angiogram which
showed significant three-vessel disease.  Additionally his
work-up included not only cardiac work-up but also PFT
evaluation.

On [**2124-5-14**], he was received preoperative work-up, and
his labs were notable for a white count of 10.6, hematocrit
39.1, and a platelet count 243, BUN and creatinine of 31 and
1.6; coags were with a PT and INR of 13.9 and 1.3, with a PTT
of 29.4.  He had cardiac clearance.  Carotid ultrasound as
previously stated was negative.  Chest x-ray showed mild
congestive heart failure.  Recheck showed some worsening
failure.  Urinalysis was negative.  He was placed on
perioperative beta-blocker.

On [**2124-5-15**], the patient went to the Operating Room
where he underwent aorto-SMA bypass with an 8 x 40 mm PTFE
graft under the assistance of Drs. [**Last Name (STitle) 1391**], [**Name5 (PTitle) **], and
Shan.  At the time of operation, the findings were a
calcified aorta and occluded left CIA.  The patient's blood
loss was 100 cc.  He received 2200 cc of Crystalloid.  Urine
output was 420 cc for the case.  There were no complications.
He went to the PACU with palpable popliteals bilaterally, and
his feet were warm.  He received Heparin 500 U/hr, as well as
Neo-Synephrine, and Dobutamine.  The patient remained
intubated.

Cardiac consultation was required ..................
postoperative due to the patient's Dobutamine requirement and
low cardiac index.  Initial index was 1.1 intraoperative with
a PA pressure of 61/30, and CVP of 14.  Dobutamine had been
started intraoperatively empirically for hemodynamic
findings.  Electrocardiogram postoperatively was unchanged
with left bundle branch block.  Cardiology recommended
following cardiac outputs, as well as PA saturations and
aortic saturations.  Echocardiogram was rechecked with a goal
wedge stated to be approximately 18.  His enzymes were
ordered to be cycled accordingly.

At the time of postoperative check at 6:30 p.m. on [**2124-5-15**], he was still on Dobutamine drip at 2.5, Heparin drip at
500 U/hr, and epidural for pain.  He remained intubated and
sedated.  His temperature was 38.1??????C, 80, with frequent APCs,
blood pressure 110/50, CVP 15, PA pressure 52/24, wedge 24.
Fick Cardiac output index numbers were 4.07 and 2.31, with an
SVR of 1179.  Non-Fick output index were 3.89 and 2.21.  He
was on ................... with an SIMV, pressure support of
60%, 700 x 10, 5 and 5.  Arterial blood gases on that were
7.32, 35, 158, 22, and 98%.  He had a mixed mean of 70.  He
received a total 2700 cc of fluids.  Immediately
postoperatively he received 1 U packed red blood cells.  His
postoperative hematocrit was 29.2, with a creatinine of 1.8,
and PTT of 85 on Heparin drip as noted.  His CK was 90,
troponin less than 0.3.

Postoperative chest x-ray showed mild congestive heart
failure.  Swan-Ganz catheter was in good position.  There was
no evidence of pneumothorax.  Electrocardiogram showed no
acute ischemia.  No changes.  Echocardiogram postoperatively
demonstrated an ejection fraction of 25%, with decreased
right ventricular motion, which was a new finding.  Overall
echocardiogram findings showed global hypokinesis which drove
the service to rule the patient out for myocardial
infarction.  Adequate oxygenation had to be ensured.

The plan was to keep the patient intubated over night, rule
him out serially, and support him hemodynamically.  The
patient was therefore admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for postoperative
management.

By postoperative day #1, he was doing well hemodynamically,
although he did have a temperature to 101.3??????.  He was in
sinus rhythm at 93, with a blood pressure of 111/49.  CVP was
9, PA pressure 48/20, output index of 6.1 and 3.49, with an
SVR of 630.  He remained vented and supported.  He was doing
otherwise satisfactory.  He was noted to have a postoperative
creatinine at this time of 2.5 which was markedly elevated.
Again this was thought to be secondary to his recent contrast
load and intraoperative fluid shift and questionable
transient hypotension and low index output.

Over the next several days, the patient was weaned from the
vent on postoperative day #3.  He was reintubated for
respiratory distress.  He was noted to have a troponin leak
as well.  At this time, his hematocrit was 29.9, and his BUN
and creatinine were up to 112 and 4.3, falling into acute
postoperative renal failure.  He remained intubated and
sedated.  He was noted to have some cool cyanotic toes.  He
had a left posterior tibialis present by Doppler.  He was
being supported with Dobutamine and being diuresed with
Natrecor for his pulmonary edema which had occurred
postoperatively from flu
