Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname **],[**Known firstname **] was admitted on [**4-2**] with mesenteric ischemia.
She agreed to have an elective surgery. Pre-operatively, she was
consented. A CXR, EKG, UA, CBC, Electrolytes, T/S - were
obtained,  all other preparations were made.

It was decided that she would undergo an angiogram. We were
unsuccessfully to open up her previous SMA stent

We then decided to do a Aorto-celiac/SMA bypass.

She was prepped, and brought down to the operating room for
surgery. Intra-operatively, she was closely monitored and
remained hemodynamically stable. She tolerated the procedure
well without any difficulty or complication.

Post-operatively, she was extubated and transferred to the PACU
for further stabilization and monitoring.

She was then transferred to the VICU for further recovery. While
in the VICU she received monitored care. When stable she was
delined. Her diet was advanced. A PT consult was obtained. When
she was stabilized from the acute setting of post operative
care, she was transferred to floor status

On the floor, she remained hemodynamically stable with his pain
controlled. She progressed with physical therapy to improve her
strength and mobility. She continues to make steady progress
without any incidents. She was discharged to a rehabilitation
facility in stable condition.

To note was treated for a UTI.

She also had low potassium and magnesium. These were replaced.
She will follow up with her PCP this week to recheck her lytes.
She is to go home on mag and potassium supplements.

She will also follow - up with Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **] in [**12-13**] weeks for staple
removal.
