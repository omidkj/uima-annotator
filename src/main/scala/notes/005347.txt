   Blood Culture, Routine (Pending):


Brief Hospital Course:
**MICU Course**
83 y.o. female w/advanced AD, history of DVT, PAF, severe
decubitus ulcers, reccurrent UTI, presents with urosepsis and
afib w/RVR.
.
# Shock. Patient was initially admitted to the MICU for septic
shock, with fever, hypotension and UTI suggesting urosepsis.
Mildly elevated liver enzymes and [**Last Name (un) **] implied that the patient
was found relatively early in her decompensation. Pt was started
on Zosyn, Vanc and was briefly on pressors for the first night
of admission but quickly weaned off with fluid boluses.
