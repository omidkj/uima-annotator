Chief Complaint:
Seizure

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Endotracheal intubation


History of Present Illness:
55 y/o F with h/o of migraines and depression who was presented
to [**Hospital3 **] with seizure. Stablized, intubated for airway
protection and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].

The patient was found at 12:30pm by her husband having seizures
in bed. He called EMS who noted the patient to be having a
tonic-clonic seizure with eyes deviated to the left and left
arm/leg convulsing and administered 2mg ativan and narcan
without improvement. Brought to [**Hospital3 **] where seziure
was broken with 8mg of ativan and 1500mg of dilantin. CT head
(-). UTox (+) for amphetamine, barbituates, [**Hospital3 18496**] and opiates.
Lactate elevated. Intubated for airway protection and trsnferred
to [**Hospital1 18**].

In discussion over the phone with the patient's husband she has
been very depressed recently. Unclear if taking all of her meds.


At [**Hospital1 18**], VS 102 157/84 TV 500 RR 14 60% fio2 5 peep. An OGT was
placed and drained 300ml of dark fluid that was hemmocult (+).
Started on IV pantoprazole and ocreotide and admitted to the
MICU.

On arrival to the MCIU, VS 99.3 77 160/69 99%. Intubated and
sedated.

daughters.  Does administrative work. Has had a live-in "friend"

heroin and presciption pills. Family and Pt. have voiced their
wishes that he does not visit in the hospital.

Pertinent Results:
IMAGING STUDIES:

CXR [**2119-8-6**]

IMPRESSION:

1.  There has been interval appearance of mild to moderate
pulmonary and
perihilar edema.  No pleural effusions or pneumothorax.
Overall, cardiac and
mediastinal contours are stable.

MRI Head [**2119-8-5**]

FINDINGS:

Study is limited due to motion-related artifacts on multiple
sequences.
Within this limitation, on the diffusion sequences, there is no
focus of slow diffusion to suggest an acute infarct.  There is
asymmetry in the size of the lateral ventricles, with the left
being slightly larger than right.  On the FLAIR sequence, there
are several areas of hyperintense signal, involving
predominantly the cortex, in the frontal, parietal, and the
occipital lobes as well as in the left medial temporal lobe.
Small areas of involvement in the adjacent white matter are also
seen.  There is no abnormal enhancement noted in these areas.
There is no focus of negative susceptibility to suggest
hemorrhage allowing for the areas of mineralization. Patient is
intubated.  There is mildly increased signal intensity in the
mastoid air cells on both sides from fluid/mucosal thickening.
The major intracranial arterial flow voids are noted.

MR ANGIOGRAM OF THE HEAD:  The left vertebral artery is
dominant.  The major arteries of the intracranial circulation
are patent, without focal
flow-limiting stenosis.  The A1 segment on the left side is
diminutive.  There is contour irregularity related to
atherosclerotic disease at multiple levels. A tiny outpouching
is seen from the lateral aspect of the left cavernous carotid
segment and also the right, question artifactual related to
pulsation artifacts/small outpouchings. The P1 segment on the
left side is diminutive, with prominent posterior communicating
artery.

IMPRESSION:
1.  Several areas of FLAIR hyperintense signal in the cerebral
parenchyma, - The etiology of  these findings is uncertain, a
broad differential diagnosis including encephalitis,
seizure-induced changes either reactive or inflammatory changes
or related to medication/toxic etiology.  Clinical and lab
correlation and close followup can be considered to assess
stability.

2.  Patent major intracranial arteries as described above, with
evidence of mild contour irregularity related to atherosclerotic
disease.

Findings
LEFT ATRIUM: Normal LA size.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: RA not well visualized. The
patient is mechanically ventilated. Cannot assess RA pressure.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thickness, cavity size, and
global systolic function (LVEF>55%). Suboptimal technical
quality, a focal LV wall motion abnormality cannot be fully
excluded. No resting LVOT gradient.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: RV not well seen.

AORTIC VALVE: No valvular AS. The increased transaortic velocity
is related to high cardiac output. Significant AR, but cannot be
quantified.

MITRAL VALVE: Normal mitral valve leaflets with trivial MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Tricuspid valve not well visualized.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Pulmonic valve not well seen.

PERICARDIUM: There is an anterior space which most likely
represents a fat pad, though a loculated anterior pericardial
effusion cannot be excluded.

GENERAL COMMENTS: Suboptimal image quality - poor echo windows.

Conclusions
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function are normal
(LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall
motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. There is no
valvular aortic stenosis. The increased transaortic velocity is
likely related to high cardiac output. Significant aortic
regurgitation is present, but cannot be quantified. The mitral
valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral
regurgitation. There is an anterior space which most likely
represents a prominent fat pad.

IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Normal biventricular
cavity sizes with preserved global biventricular systolic
function. Aortic regurgitation - ? Mild.

CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS:
Based on [**2114**] AHA endocarditis prophylaxis recommendations, the
echo findings indicate prophylaxis is NOT recommended. Clinical
decisions regarding the need for prophylaxis should be based on
clinical and echocardiographic data.

EEG [**2119-8-7**]
IMPRESSION: This telemetry captured no pushbutton activations.
It showed a
mildly slow background throughout with frequent epileptiform
spike discharges
in the left temporal region. The discharges, however, did not
occur
repetitively in short segments nor were they rhythmic or
prolonged. The slow
encephalopathic background was unchanged from the previous day's
