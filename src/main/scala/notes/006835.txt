Chief Complaint:
R sided weakness
.
ICU admission: hypoxia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
PICC

History of Present Illness:
Mr [**Known lastname 109963**] is an 81 yo male with lung cancer ([**2078**]), throat cancer
(approx [**2101**]), and new diagnosis of mandible cancer who was
found down on his kitchen floor by a neighbor after 24+ hours.
At this point he reported awakening with new R arm weakness. He
states that he was in his usual state of health at this time and
thinks he "must have slipped." He denied any preceding weakness
or numbness in his extremities. He does have approx 1 month hx
of dysarthria and pain from jaw mass. Additionally denies fever,
chills, cough or respiratory symptoms. During the interview he
is coughing, but states that this started once he got to the
hospital. No sick contacts. Denies headache or neck stiffness.
He was taken by EMS to the ER at which point his O2 sat was 88%
and he was placed on a NRB.
.
Upon arrival to the ED his vitals were T 98.9, HR 67, BP 116/62,
RR 20, O2 sat 96% on NRB, and while there failed a trial on
nasal cannula and placed on 70% cool mist mask. ABG
revealed:7.40/51/135 on NRB, and CXR showed RLL opacity
suspicious for pneumonia. He received 3L of IVFs as well as
Levoflox 750mg IV x 1 and Flagyl 500mg IV x 1. Stat CT Head
showed no evidence of bleed. Neurology was consulted and
recommended MRI Brain and C-spine +/- gadolinium to eval for
mets once respiratory status stabilized (not emergent) as well
as EEG.


Past Medical History:
Lung cancer- s/p radiation
Neck Cancer- newly diagnosed/awaiting biopsy, pt has severe
dysarthria x1month as a result. Large mandibular mass for which
he is followed at [**Hospital 13128**] Institute


Social History:
Patient lives alone in [**Location (un) 583**], widowed x3 years, no children,
quit smoking in [**2069**]'s, drinks on Saturdays up to 5 glasses of
alchohol - denies any withdrawal symptoms. No no illicit druges.

Microbiology:

.
LE Doppler: Partially occlusive DVT noted in the left mid SFV to
the popliteal vein, with eccentric shape, likely chronic.
.
Non-contrast Head CT: multiple prior lacunar infarctions, age
related atrophy with widened ventricles, no hemorrhage or mass
effect.
.
CXR: RLL infiltrate c/w pneumonia versus large mass
.
CTA prelim read:
1.  Segmental pulmonary embolism to the right middle lobe.
Smaller
subsegmental filling defect in a left lower lobe branch.
2.  Pleural-based mass, the right lung base mass and extensive
pleural thickening in the setting of pathologically enlarged
mediastinal and left axillary lymph nodes appear consistent with
the patient's reported history of mesothelioma.
3.  Centrilobular emphysema and right basilar honeycombing are
consistent with advanced chronic interstitial lung disease.
4.  Air-bronchograms present at the medial aspect of the right
lung base could be consistent with pneumonia.  Clinical
correlation recommended.
.
MRI/MRA head:
IMPRESSION (prelim):Scattered throughout the left cerebral
hemisphere, predominantly within the left parietotemporal lobe,
but also including the occipital and frontal lobes, there are
multiple focal areas of restricted diffusion with accompanying
FLAIR hyperintensities likely to represent acute/subacute
infarctions, probably secondary to multiple emboli.  No areas of
restricted diffusion are demonstrated in the right cerebrum.
There is no evidence of intracranial hemorrhage, mass effect, or
shift of
normally midline structures.  There is moderate periventricular
T2 and FLAIR hyperintensity consistent with chronic
microvascular infarction.
1. Multifocal left cerebellar areas of restricted diffusion with
associated edema, most likely representing acute/subacute
infarction. Given distribution, this probably represents embolic
phenomenon. The distribution of these lesions favors infarction
over encephalitis.
2. Slightly heterogeneous clivus which although not overtly
consistent with metastasis, can be followed up with bone scan if
there is further clinical concern.
3.MRA CIRCLE OF [**Location (un) **]:  There is no evidence of stenosis,
aneurysm, or vascular malformation.

.
Video Swallow Evaluation:
This swallowing pattern correlates to a Dysphagia Outcome
Severity Scale (DOSS) rating of 2, moderately-severe dysphagia.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Suggest having a discussion with the pt regarding his options
for nutrition (POs alone vs POs with supplemental tube feeds vs
tube feeds only). Pt will need to understand the risks of
continued aspiration prior to making his decision.
2. If he decides to continue with PO intake, I would recommend a
PO diet of nectar thick liquids and pureed solids with the
following aspiration precautions:
a) alternate between every bite and sip
b) small, single sips of liquid only -no straws and no chugging
c) pills crushed with purees
.


Brief Hospital Course:
He was briefly admitted to the floor and then transfered to the
ICU for hypoxia. In the ICU, his hypoxia resolved and he was
transitioned from NRB to NC. He was transfered back to the
hospital wards. During his hospital stay, he was treated for PE
and pneumonia. He was followed by neurology for new left
hemisphere strokes. He was also seen by the palliative care team
given his deteriorating performace status and poor prognosis.
The patient decided that he would like further treatment and
rehabilitation and would consider hospice in the future.
Transfer to the VA was arranged, but on the day of transfer, the
patient became somnolent. After discussion with his brother, the
patient was made [**Name (NI) 3225**]. After being made [**Name (NI) 3225**], he received morphine
for pain and air hunger. On [**11-28**], morphine was discontinued per
the brother's request. In discussion with his brother, he was to
be given sparing amounts of morphine only if the patient was
suffering. Overnight on [**10-29**], the patient was agitated,
moaning and tachypnic per nursing report and was given 1 dose of
Morphine 2mg IV at 3:30 am. He passed away at 11:45 am on
[**2107-11-29**].
