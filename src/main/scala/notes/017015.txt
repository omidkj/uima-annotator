Service:  Vascular Surgery

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Symptomatic pseudoaneurysm of previous proximal
anastomosis of abdominal aortic aneurysm tube graft.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 73-year-old
nondiabetic white female with chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease, hypertension, and hypercholesterolemia who had
undergone a repair of ruptured infrarenal abdominal aortic
aneurysm 10 years ago at an outside hospital.

Following the repair, the patient developed a proximal
anastomotic pseudoaneurysm.  At that time, the patient
refused treatment.

Over the previous week, the patient complained of extreme
fatigue.  Over the last three to four days, she complained of
abdominal pain and was seen in the [**Hospital 1474**] Hospital
Emergency Room on [**2200-7-30**].  An abdominal computed
tomography scan indicated a leaking abdominal aortic aneurysm
as well as an atrophic left kidney.  Her hematocrit was 25.2.
The patient was Med-flighted to the [**Hospital1 190**] Emergency Room for further evaluation.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Hypertension.
2.  Hypercholesterolemia.
3.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:   Repair of infrarenal ruptured
abdominal aortic aneurysm with supraceliac cross clamp 10
years ago at an outside hospital.

FAMILY HISTORY:   Family history was noncontributory.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives alone.  She has family
living nearby.  She quit smoking cigarettes in [**2196**] after two
packs per day for the previous 50 years.  She does not drink
alcohol.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1.  Albuterol inhaler.
2.  Metoprolol.
3.  Lescol-XL.
4.  Flexeril.
5.  Percocet.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Vital signs revealed
her temperature was 98.4, her heart rate was 100, her blood
pressure was 180/108, and her oxygen saturation was 100% on 3
liters oxygen via nasal cannula.  In general, a calm elderly
white female in no acute distress.  Head, eyes, ears, nose,
and throat examination revealed pupils were equal, round, and
reactive to light.  Chest examination revealed the lungs were
clear bilaterally.  Heart was regular in rate and rhythm
without murmur.  The abdomen was soft.  No pulsatile mass.
Moderate tenderness over the left upper quadrant and left
flank.  Extremity examination revealed the feet were equally
warm.  Right dorsalis pedis and posterior tibialis pulses
were palpable.  Left dorsalis pedis and posterior tibialis
pulses were dopplerable.  Neurologic examination was
nonfocal.

PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:   Laboratories
from the outside hospital prior to admission revealed her
white blood cell count was 7.5, her hematocrit was 25.2, and
her platelets were 454,000.

PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  Electrocardiogram revealed a
normal sinus rhythm with Q waves in V4 through V6.

A computed tomography of the abdomen with intravenous
contrast revealed a large pseudoaneurysm at the proximal
anastomosis of the prior tube graft repair of the abdominal
aortic aneurysm with a large retroperitoneal hemorrhage at
the renal artery level.

CONCISE SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was started
on a Nipride drip in the Emergency Department for her
hypertension of 180/108.  Her goal systolic blood pressure
was 100 to 110.

She was seen and examined in the Emergency Department by Dr.
[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] and taken to the operating room for emergent
repair of the pseudoaneurysm at the proximal anastomosis of a
previously placed infrarenal aortic tube graft.  A
supraceliac aortic cross clamp was necessary.  The patient
received multiple units of packed red blood cells and fresh
frozen plasma intraoperatively.  Following surgery, the
patient had warm feet with palpable pedal pulses on the right
and a palpable posterior tibialis pulse on the left.

The patient was transferred to the Surgical Intensive Care
Unit postoperatively.  She remained intubated and sedated.
On postoperative day two, the patient was noted to have
pancreatitis with an amylase of 555 and a lipase of 472.
These peaked respectively at 581 and 891.  The patient was
aggressively hydrated, and after several days her amylase and
lipase returned to baseline.

On postoperative day three, the patient's heart rate was
noted to be in the 40s, and no blood pressure was obtainable.
Cardiopulmonary resuscitation was started, and epinephrine
and atropine were given.  The patient developed atrial
fibrillation and was prepared for cardioversion after
amiodarone was started.  However, cardioversion was not
necessary because she spontaneously reverted to a normal
sinus rhythm.  A chest x-ray showed congestive heart failure.

Cardiology was consulted.  An echocardiogram at the bedside
showed an ejection fraction of 40% to 45%.  Continued
amiodarone infusion was recommended at least until the
patient was extubated.  The patient diuresed well with small
intravenous doses of Lasix.  Pressors were discouraged
secondary to the patient's single functioning right kidney.

The patient was transfused several units of packed red blood
cells over the next two days to keep her hematocrit greater
than 30.  Her cardiac enzymes and troponin T were negative.

The patient remained intubated until [**2200-8-8**].  Multiple
previous attempts at extubation brought on respiratory
distress.  After extubation, the patient's pulmonary toilet
was maximized.  She was encouraged to use incentive
spirometry.  Albuterol nebulizer treatments were helpful.

Nutrition via total parenteral nutrition was started on [**2200-8-4**] because of the patient's extensive intubation and
failure to be weaned off the ventilator.  The nasogastric
tube was finally removed on [**2200-8-9**].  The patient
remained nothing by mouth until she had a bowel movement on
[**2200-8-10**] following a rectal suppository.  She was then
allowed a few sips.  However, the patient became distended,
nauseated, and vomited small quantities.  An abdominal
ultrasound on [**2200-8-12**] showed multiple small gallstones
with mild gallbladder edema.  No intrahepatic ductal
dilatation, and moderate abdominal ascites.  The patient
tried clear liquids again with minimal success.

A computed tomography of the abdomen with contrast done on
[**2200-8-14**] showed mild pancreatitis with three small fluid
collections inferior to the pancreas, with the largest
measuring 3.5 cm.  There was a left subphrenic fluid
collection.  A small intimal flap was seen in the abdominal
aorta.  The flow within the aortic pseudoaneurysm had been
excluded.  There was concern that these fluid collections
could represent a pancreatic pseudocyst.  The General Surgery
team was consulted.  They evaluated the patient and planned
to compare her abdominal computed tomography done at the
outside hospital.

The patient continued to take clear liquids but refused a
regular diet in spite of having reasonable bowel sounds.
Stool samples for Clostridium difficile cultures were sent.
In the meantime, Flagyl 500 mg by mouth three times per day
times two weeks was started empirically.  The initial two
samples were negative for Clostridium difficile.

Physical Therapy was consulted to see the patient on [**2200-8-12**].  The patient declined to participate because she was
too fatigued.  Physical Therapy saw the patient again two
days later and recommended a [**Hospital 3058**] rehabilitation stay.
However, the patient refused a [**Hospital 3058**] rehabilitation and
insisted she be discharged to home.  Therefore, Physical
Therapy recommended several more sessions until they cleared
her for safety at home.

The patient developed some thrush and was started on Nystatin
swish-and-swallow on [**2200-8-15**].  Her
methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus screens done in
the Surgical Intensive Care Unit were negative.

The patient refused further workup by the General Surgery
team and insisted on leaving the hospital on [**2200-8-16**] in
spite of being told that she was not medically stable and
still had several medical issues that were r
