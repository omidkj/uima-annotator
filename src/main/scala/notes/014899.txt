Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2105-5-22**] Pericardectomy

History of Present Illness:
53 y/o male with h/o constrictive pericarditis with unknown
etiology for approx. 10 years who presented to OSH with leg and
scrotal edema. He is also c/o shortness of breath and PND.
Patient was diursed and underwent cardiac cath which was
consistent with preicardial constriction. He has refused surgery
in the past, but now agrees and was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for
surgery.

Past Medical History:
Constrictive Pericarditis, Diabetes Mellitus, Hypertension,
Obesity, Left Eye blindness

Social History:

Gen: Ill appearing white male
Skin: Bilat. venous stasis LE
HEENT: Poor Dentition, right eye opacity, lef eye fixed pupil
Neck: Supple, FROM, +JVD, -Carotid bruit
Chest: CTAB -w/r/r
Heart: RRR, [**3-31**] murmur
Abd: Soft, NT/ND, +BS, obese
Ext: Warm, 4+ bilat. LE edema, -varicosities
Neuro: A&O x 3, MAE, non-focal

Pertinent Results:
[**2105-5-22**] Echo: The left atrium is moderately dilated. No
spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body of the left
atrium. Mild spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body of
the right atrium. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color
Doppler. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
The left ventricular cavity size is top normal/borderline
dilated. Overall left ventricular systolic function is low
normal (LVEF 50-55%). There appears to be focal left and right
ventricular apical hypokinesis but poor apical windows prevent
complete evaluation. There is abnormal septal motion suggestive
of pericardial constriction. There are simple atheroma in the
aortic arch. There are simple atheroma in the descending
thoracic aorta. There are three aortic valve leaflets. There is
a strand-like echodensity on the left ventricular outflow tract
side of either the left or non-coronary cusp of the aortic valve
that likely represents a degredative process but an aortic valve
vegetation mass cannot be excluded. There is no aortic valve
stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is
seen. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. There
is a very large left pleual effusion as well as a right pleural
effusion and ascites. After stripping of the pericardium there
were no major changes. The pleural effusions were drained.

RADIOLOGY  Final Report

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2105-5-27**] 7:04 AM

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)

Reason: r/o ptx. assess effusions

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
53 year old man s/p pericardectomy and ct removal
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
r/o ptx. assess effusions
AP CHEST [**5-27**], 8:47 A.M.

HISTORY: Pericardiotomy. Chest tube removal.

IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**5-22**] and 30:

Left pleural drain has been removed. Small left pleural effusion
and small right pleural effusion are stable. Very small right
apical pneumothorax has decreased. Post-operative
cardiomediastinal silhouette is unremarkable and unchanged. Left
basal atelectasis is improved.

Brief Hospital Course:
As mentioned in the HPI, Mr. [**Known lastname **] was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for
surgical management. He underwent usual pre-operative lab work
on day of admission. On [**5-22**] he was brought to the operating
room where he underwent a pericardectomy. Please see operative
report for surgical details. Following surgery he was
transferred to the CSRU for invasive monitoring in stable
condition. Within 24 hours he was weaned from sedation, awoke
neurologically intact and extubated. On post-op day one he was
started on beta blockers and diuretics. ID consulted on Mr.
[**Known lastname **] to help determine plan and to determine reason for
constrictive pericarditis (r/o TB as cause). On post-op day one
he appeared to be doing well and was transferred to the
telemetry floor. Over the next several days he worked with
physical therapy for strength and mobility. Chest tubes and
epicardial pacing wires were removed per protocol. He was
diuresed and medically managed during these days and awaited
results of tissue microbiology which were all negative.  He
continued to diurese well.
