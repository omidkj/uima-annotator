HISTORY:  Baby Girl [**Known lastname **] is the 2.25 kg product of a 38-2/7
week gestation, born to a 37-year-old, G2, P1 now 2 mom.
Prenatal screens: O negative, antibody negative, hepatitis
surface antigen negative, RPR nonreactive, rubella immune,
GBS negative. This pregnancy complicated by abnormal triple
screen with increased risk for trisomy 21. Mother declined
[**Name2 (NI) **] prior to delivery. Pregnancy was otherwise
uncomplicated. There was no fever. Spontaneous rupture of
membranes occurred 1 hour prior to delivery. Infant was born
via C-section because of nonreassuring fetal heart tracing.
Meconium was noted at delivery. Infant was bulb suctioned and
given blow-by O2. Her Apgars were 7 at 1 minute and 8 at 5
minutes. She was noted to have some grunting and respiratory
distress, and was brought to the newborn intensive care unit
for further management. She was placed on CPAP due to
increased respiratory distress.

PHYSICAL EXAM ON ADMISSION:  Weight 2.25 kg (10-25th
percentile), length 46.5 (25th percentile), head
circumference 32 cm (25th percentile). Normocephalic.
Anterior fontanel open and flat. Palate intact. Bilateral
epicanthal folds. Red reflex deferred bilaterally. Wide nasal
bridge present. Protruding tongue present. Neck supple with
thickened skin. Lungs with shallow respirations, nasal
flaring and intercostal retractions. Cardiovascular regular
rate and rhythm, no murmur. Femoral pulses 2+ bilaterally.
Abdomen soft with loops of bowel present, active bowel
sounds, no masses. Anus patent. Spine midline without sacral
dimple. Skin: Left thigh with 1 cm oval-shaped nevus noted.
Buttocks with mongolian spot present. Hips stable, held in
breech position. Clavicles intact. Extremities warm and well-
perfused with brisk cap refill. Neuro: Decreased tone in
upper and lower extremities.

HISTORY OF HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEMS:  RESPIRATORY: [**Known lastname **]
was admitted to the newborn intensive care unit with mild
respiratory distress which progressed over the first 24 hours
of life. She was initially placed on CPAP and then was
intubated. She remained intubated for a total of 24 hours, at
which time she transitioned to CPAP. She remained in CPAP for
a total of 5 days, at which time she transitioned to nasal
cannula O2. She remained stable on nasal cannula O2 13-50 cc
of oxygen until [**2151-7-22**] with a marked increase in her
O2 needs from 50 cc to 1 liter of O2 due to increased
desaturations requiring blow-by O2. She later weaned back
down to 200 cc of nasal cannula O2, but per cardiology
request, infant was intubated, and she continues to be
intubated to date. Her current respiratory support is a PIP
of 27, a PEEP of 7, with a breath rate of 34, pressure
support of 6. Her most recent arterial blood gases was on
[**2151-7-31**] - pH 7.35, PCO2 59, PO2 28. Over the day of
[**8-1**], she had difficulty of oxygenation requiring
increased O2 support as well as vent support. iNO was added with
inital improvement but O2 requirement went back up to 100% Now
She is currently at 20ppm.

CARDIOVASCULAR: [**Known lastname **] was admitted to the newborn intensive
care unit and needed 1 dose of normal saline for borderline
blood pressures. She was placed on dopamine, a max of 5
mcg/kg. She weaned off the dopamine [**2151-7-12**]. She had
a murmur which presented on [**2151-7-13**] and continues to
date. With the onset of her new murmur, it increased oxygen
needs. On [**7-22**], cardiology was consulted. An
echocardiogram was obtained on [**7-23**] revealing pulmonary
hypertension, a dilated right ventricle, and poor right
ventricular function. With the echocardiogram finding,
cardiology recommended intubation and sedation, and
restarting the dopamine at 5 mcg/kg. She remained on
dopamine, and her follow-up echocardiogram on [**7-26**]
showed improvement in her ventricular function and
recommendations at that time were to extubate. Infant was
extubated. She remained on nasal cannula O2 for about 12
hours and progressed with her respiratory distress and was
reintubated. She currently remains intubated. She is also on
dopamine of 5 mcg/kg/D. She is also receiving Versed and
fentanyl for sedation. Her most recent echocardiogram was on
[**2151-7-30**] with mild mitral regurg, mild tricuspid
regurg, and a dilated and hypertrophic right ventricle with
depressed systolic function. Right ventricular pressure is
estimated by the tricuspid regurg jet velocity to be about 85
mmHg. Cardiology has been consulted and continues to work
closely with the neonatology group.

FLUID AND ELECTROLYTES: Her birthweight was 2.25 kg. She was
initially started on 60 cc/kg/D of D10W. Infant did start on
enteral feedings on [**2151-7-13**], and she advanced to full
enteral feedings of 120 cc/kg/D of NeoSure 24 calorie. On
[**7-23**], with the increased respiratory distress and
concerns for cardiac issues, infant was made n.p.o., and she
continues to be n.p.o. to date. She is currently receiving
120 cc/kg/D of D10PN. Her most recent set of electrolytes are
from [**2151-7-31**] - sodium 136, potassium 3.4, chloride
96, total CO2 28, SGOT 27, SGPT 13. Her most recent BUN and
creatinine from [**7-27**] - BUN 5 and creatinine 0.2.

GI: Her peak bilirubin was on day of life #2 of 5.8/1.3. Her
most recent bilirubin was on [**2151-7-31**] - total bili
2, direct bili 1.2, GGT 123.

HEMATOLOGY: Hematocrit on admission was 49. Her most recent
hematocrit is on [**7-21**] of 45. She has not required any
blood transfusions during this hospital course.
She recently received PRBC for a Hct of 25. Transfusion was
completed at 9am on [**2151-8-2**].
INFECTIOUS DISEASE: CBC and blood culture were obtained on
admission. CBC was benign. Blood cultures remained negative
at 48 hours, at which time she was discontinued from her
ampicillin and gentamicin. Infant started on ampicillin and
cefotaxime due to worsening respiratory issues. She received
a total of 14 days of amp and cefotaxime which were
discontinued on [**2151-7-18**]. On [**2151-7-21**], with
increased respiratory needs, a CBC and blood culture were
obtained. CBC was benign, and blood culture was negative.
Ampicillin and gentamicin were discontinued at 48 hours. She
is currently receiving vancomycin and gentamicin for a left
foot cellulitis. Blood cultures remain negative. Her most
recent levels had a peak of 27.4 and a trough of 8.1, and
that was on [**2151-7-28**].

NEURO: Infant has been appropriate for gestational age. She
is irritable at times. She is receiving fentanyl q.4h. and
Versed q.6h. with good sedation.

SENSORY: Hearing screen was not performed and should be done
prior to discharge.

PSYCHOSOCIAL: Mother is Haitian and appears to be depressed
and having a difficult time with the diagnosis. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]

bonding experience.
