   CLOSTRIDIUM DIFFICILE TOXIN A & B TEST (Final [**2188-2-4**]):
      Reported to and read back by [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] [**2188-2-4**] 11:25AM.
      CLOSTRIDIUM DIFFICILE.
         FECES POSITIVE FOR C. DIFFICILE TOXIN BY EIA.
           (Reference Range-Negative).
         A positive result in a recently treated patient is of
uncertain
         significance unless the patient is currently
symptomatic
         (relapse).

   URINE CULTURE (Final [**2188-2-10**]):
      SERRATIA MARCESCENS.    >100,000 ORGANISMS/ML..
         This organism may develop resistance to third
generation
         cephalosporins during prolonged therapy. Therefore,
isolates that
         are initially susceptible may become resistant within
three to
         four days after initiation of therapy.  For serious
infections,
         repeat culture and sensitivity testing may therefore be
warranted
         if third generation cephalosporins were used.
         Piperacillin/tazobactam sensitivity testing available
on request.

IMAGING:
CT ABDOMEN/PELVIS [**2188-2-2**]:
The included portions of the lung bases demonstrate small
bilateral
pleural effusions, left greater than right with associated
atelectasis. There are dense calcifications of the aorta
extending throughout the intra-abdominal aorta to the iliac
arteries.

Within the abdomen and pelvis, the patient is status post repair
of an
anterior abdominal wall hernia. There is post-operative
subcutaneous
emphysema and fat stranding. A more focal 5.4 x 3.7 cm
collection with
air-fluid level is present in the anterior left lower
subcutaneous tissues
(2:40).

No focal liver lesion is seen. There may be some intrahepatic
biliary
dilation, though evaluation is limited on this non-contrast
examination.
Additionally, the CBD appears prominent measuring approximately
9 mm in
diameter. The gallbladder appears unremarkable. The spleen
appears unchanged with coarse calcification.

The native kidneys are atrophic with hypodensities consistent
with cysts.
Loops of small and large bowel are normal in size and caliber.

A trace amount of free fluid is present within the pelvis;
however, no large collection to explain hematocrit drop is seen.
No hematoma is identified.

There is a transplant kidney in the left lower quadrant. The
bladder contains a Foley catheter. Multiple foci of subcutaneous
emphysema are seen. A locule of air along the anterior abdominal
wall (2:51), could be within the abdomen, though would not be
unexpected given the recent surgery.

There is diffuse anasarca.

No concerning osseous lesion is seen.

IMPRESSION:
1. Postoperative changes (mesh placement) with subcutaneous
emphysema and
edema within the subcutaneous tissues of the anterior abdominal
wall,
bilaterally. A focal subcutaneous fluid collection with air
fluid level
measuring 5.4 x 3.7 cm may represent a postoperative seroma;
however, the
presence of infection cannot be excluded by CT.

2. No evidence of hematoma or collection to explain hematocrit
drop.

3. Mild intrahepatic biliary dilation. Mildly dilated CBD,
though not
significantly changed from prior examinations. If there is
clinical concern, a right upper quadrant ultrasound may be
performed.

4. Small bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right.

5. Atrophy native kidneys with cysts; transplant kidney in left
iliac fossa.

TRANSPLANTED KIDNEY U/S [**2188-2-8**]:
The renal transplant is located in the left lower quadrant and
measures 10.7 cm.  No hydronephrosis, stones, or masses are
observed. No perinephric fluid collection is seen. The urinary
bladder appearance is normal.

COLOR DOPPLER AND SPECTRAL WAVEFORM ANALYSIS: The MRV is patent
showing the normal flow direction.

The MRA is patent with normal peak systolic velocity.

The upper, mid, and lower pole of the renal arteries are patent,
showing RIs in the range of 0.78 to 0.83 that are minimally
higher in comparison to prior examination ( RI's in the range of
0.75-0.8).

IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of hydronephrosis or perinephric fluid collection
in the
transplanted kidney.

2. Patent kidney vasculture.

3. Minimal interval increase in the RIs of the intrarenal
arteries.

Brief Hospital Course:
Primary Reason for Hospitalization:
75yoF admitted for elective laparoscopic ventral hernia repair
with mesh

Active Issues:

# Ventral Hernia Repair c/b acute on chronic diastolic heart
failure, c diff infection: Pt had laparoscopic ventral hernia
repair on [**2188-1-30**] by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **].  She tolerated the procedure
well and was transferred to the PACU in stable condition.  She
has had some abdominal pain since the procedure in the area of
her hernia repair.  She had a repeat CT abdomen
