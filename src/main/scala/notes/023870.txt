Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4277**]
Chief Complaint:
Left thigh pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2201-11-11**]: Prophylactic intramedullary fixation of left
proximal femur lesion


History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 23333**] is a 66 year old female with Renal Cell Carcinoma.
She has had metastatic lesions to her left femur and brain and
most recently has developed pain in her left thigh.  She is a
minimal ambulator, primarily only with transfers, however has
developed much more pain requiring increasing amounts of
Dilaudid.  Further examination revealed a lesion in the
intertrochanteric region of the left femur susceptible to
impending fracture.

Past Medical History:
# Renal Cell Carcinoma s/p nephrectomy with multiple metastases
which is slowly progressing despite chemotherapy
# CAD with STEMI and 2 BMS to LAD placed [**2-14**]
# Hypertension
# chronic systolic CHF (EF 45-50%)
# atrial fibrillation, now off coumadin afer ambulatory
monitoring failed to show significant AF burden
# pathologic R femur fracture s/p IM nail, then nonunion and
revision in [**2197**]
# CKD
# osteoarthritis
# gout
# hypothyroidism

Past Oncologic history:
1. [**1-11**]: CT scan revealed 7-cm left renal mass. Underwent left
nephrectomy.
2. [**4-12**]: Complained of right hip pain. X-ray revealed lytic
lesion with biopsy positive for renal cell carcinoma
3. [**1-13**]: T10 erosion noted
4. [**5-15**]: SRS to T10
5. [**7-15**]: embolization with RFA and cementation of T10;
cryoablation of lesion in left iliac crest
6. [**9-14**]: fixation and cementation of right femoral tumor
7. [**12-15**]: MRI of right hip at outside facility revealed large
right thigh soft tissue density concerning for progressive
metastatic disease.
8. [**2199-3-13**]: Signed consent for trial 08-219, phase III trial of
Sutent vs Pazopanib. Randomized to the Sutent arm.
10. [**2200-11-6**] MRI head (at outside facility) with unchanged left
pareital bone lesion but development of contiguous dural
enhancement enveloping the left frontal convexity. Pelvis with
right iliac bone lesion with increase in extraosseous soft
tissue component to 2.5 cm.
11. [**2200-11-12**]: Taken off 08-219 because of clinical disease
progression. Started everolimus on [**2200-12-4**].
12. On [**2201-1-28**] noted new dyspnea, possibly related to
everolimus-induced pneumonitis. Everolimus held (and
subsequently never restarted because of disease progression) and
brief steroid course started with improvement in symptoms.
13. [**2201-3-4**] MRI brain with significant interval increase in left
parietal bone metastasis, now 3.7x4.5x2.6 from 3.3x3.3x1.5 cm.
MRI chest with possible new 1.4 cm right T8 vertebral lesion.
[**2201-3-6**] MRI abdomen/pelvis with new 2.3 cm left adrenal mass,
increase in left intertrachanteric femoral lesion, 4.0x2.2x2.3
from 2.8x1.7x1.7 cm, new 11 mm lesion within tip of left iliac
crest, stable large lesion to right iliac [**Doctor First Name 362**]. [**2201-3-9**] MRI
right femur with interval increase in lesion medial to prior
pathologic mid-femoral shaft fracture, now 4.8 cm from 3.0 cm.
- Most recent zometa [**2201-3-18**]
- pazopanib started on [**2201-4-8**]

Social History:
she has two children.  She is not a smoker.  She drinks very
occasionally.  She lives at home in [**Doctor Last Name **].  Used to work
as a sculptor, was on the original design team for the GI [**Doctor First Name **].
Ambulates with a walker or uses a scooter for shopping.


Family History:
uncle had a GI cancer of unknown type.  The great aunt on her
father's side of the family had either a colon cancer or an
ovarian cancer.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient is a 66F with a history of metastatic renal cell
carcinoma previously on pazopanib, CAD with STEMI and 2 BMS to
LAD, HTN, CHF (EF 45-50%), prior atrial fibrillation, CKD, and
hypothyroidism who was found to have a lesion in the left
proximal femur with impending pathologic fracture and was
admitted for prophylactic intramedullary fixation. She started
on Pazopanib in [**2201-4-7**] and this has been complicated labile
blood pressures, ranging from 100s to 200 systolic, requiring
increasing anti-hypertensive medications. However, since
stopping pazopanib in mid [**Month (only) **] her blood pressures have
typically run 120s to 130s systolic. She continues to take
lisinopril, metoprolol, and diltiazem. She has tapered down and
this past week discontinued the hydralazine. She takes lasix as
needed for lower extremity edema, typically two to three times
per week.

The medicine consult service was requested regarding her new
post-op atrial fibrillation, and had recommended that she stop
her home metroplol, lisinopril, and diltizaem secondary to low
blood presures. On the floor, upon awaking from a nap, she was
noted to have Afib with RVR, which she was not in previously;
she said she was in [**6-16**] pain in her LLE, but denied any chest
pain, shortness of breath, she endorsed a headache, but was
without any breathing difficulties. She was AAOx3, and was given
lopressor 5 mg x 3 between 2 PM and 3 PM, and then between 3 and
4 PM was given a total of 25 mg of IV Diltiazem, without any
improvement in her atrial fibrillation, with continued rates in
the 130s. She was given 100 mg PO Metoprolol around 1 PM, and
was noted at one point after an IV Dilt bolus to have her
pressures down to the 88s systolic.

She was then transfered to the ICU for rate control and further
monitoring.  The etiology of her Afib was felt to be secondary
to a combination of hypovolemia, pain and the discontinuation of
her metoprolol and dilt.  She was started on amiodarone (bolus
followed by drip) and converted to normal sinus rhythm.  Her
blood pressures responded to IV fluids.  She was transitioned to
po amiodarone and transferred back to the floor.

On the floor she continued to work with physical therapy, able
to transfer to chair with lift only.  Her wound continued to
look good.  She was stable, tolerating a regular diet with bowel
movement.  Pain was controlled with oral Dilaudid.  She was
voiding without difficulty.
