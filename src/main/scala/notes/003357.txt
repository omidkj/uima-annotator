History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 88 year old female who was transferred from an
outside hospital on [**2115-9-12**] with a cheif complaint of right
abdominal pain for one day and a fever of 102.8.  The patient
was transferred here because a CT scan demonstrated massive
right hydronephrosis, 11.5 by 10.8 centimeters at largest
diameter, consuming most of the right side of her abdomen.
There was cortical thinning, however there was some cortex still
present.  The CT scan was reviewed with the radiologist on staff
and this was determined to be an acute on chronic problem.  The
right kidney was still making urine, as evidenced by the CT
scan.  A urinalysis was positive for leukocyte esterase and
white blood cells.  There was no obvious cause of obstruction
(no stones, no strictures).  The patient denied any dysuria,
hematuria or change in urination.  She is incontinent at
baseline.  She has no significant urologic history and has never
seen a urologist.  At rest, her pain was mild.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2115-9-13**] for abdominal pain
and severe right hydronephrosis on a CT scan.  She was started
on Ciprofloxacin and kept NPO for percutaneous nephrostomy tube
placement later that day by interventional radiology.  The
procedure went well with no problems.  [**Name (NI) **] that night, the
patient became tachycardic and hypotensive and had to be
transferred to the intensive care unit.  Of not, blood cultures
from an outside hospital were positive for E. coli.  She was
adequately resuscitated with approximately three liters of
intravenous fluid.  She responded well in the ICU and she was
afebrile overnight.  She was started on Aztreonam and cipro.
Ultimately her urine grew pan sensitive ecoli; so the aztreonam
was stopped and cipro continued.  On hospital day two, she was
transferred out of the ICU to the floor.  She recieved 2 units
of red blood cells for a hematocrit of 22.9 (from 29.8).  She
was started on a regular diet.  She had brief episodes of
paroxysmal atrial fibrillation which she was treated with
lopressor IV and PO; her pacemaker corrected her rapid rate on
several occasions.  1 set of cardiac enzymes were neg. and
serial ecgs showed no evidence of ischemia.  Her electrolytes
were aggressively replaced.
