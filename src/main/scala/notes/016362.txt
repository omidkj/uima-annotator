is awake, alert and oriented in no apparent distress.  Her
blood pressure is 101/66.  The heart is regular rate and
rhythm, S1 and S2.  Her chest is clear to auscultation
bilaterally with distant air sounds.  Extremities revealed 4+
femoral pulses bilaterally.  On the left, no pulses palpable
below the femoral level, and on the right 3+ popliteal and
dorsalis pedis pulses, no posterior tibialis pulse on the
right.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the hospital on
[**2168-1-20**], and taken to the operating room for left femoral AK
popliteal bypass graft with saphenous vein graft as well as a
left great toe amputation.  She tolerated the procedure well
and was transferred to the Post Anesthesia Care Unit in
stable condition.

In the Post Anesthesia Care Unit, she had a palpable left
dorsalis pedis and posterior tibialis pulse.  From the Post
Anesthesia Care Unit, she was transferred to the unit in
stable condition.  Her pulses continued to be palpable on the
left.  She received one unit of packed red blood cells for a
hematocrit of 26.0.

The patient did have some flattened electrocardiographic
waves on her postoperative electrocardiogram and therefore,
formal rule out was done which was negative.  She was seen by
[**Last Name (un) **] for management of her diabetes mellitus.

On postoperative day number one, the patient was doing well.
She had palpable dorsalis pedis and posterior tibialis
pulses.  Left foot was warm.  She did have some increased
blood pressure and was placed on Neo-Synephrine and given
another unit of packed red blood cells.  Blood pressure
improved.  Her hematocrit was 30.0 posttransfusion.  Her
creatinine on [**2168-1-21**], was 0.9.  Laboratories were otherwise
stable.

The patient continued to be monitored in the unit overnight.
Her diet was advanced.  She was given Lasix 20 mg.  Her
preoperative medications were restarted.  Her dorsalis pedis
and posterior tibialis continued to be dopplerable.

She was transferred to the floor on postoperative day number
three.  She continued to do well and she was afebrile and her
vital signs were stable.  Her left thigh incision was clean,
dry and intact.  Her left great toe amputation site was
clean, dry and intact as well, and her dorsalis pedis and
posterior tibialis were dopplerable bilaterally.  Her
hematocrit was 26.5 which was stable.  Her creatinine was
0.8.

On [**1-22**], the patient was noted to have blood pressure
in the 80's over 50's.  She was given a 250 cc bolus of normal
saline and her Lopressor was decreased to 12.5 mg p.o. b.i.d.
She was asymptomatic.  Her systolic pressure remained in the
90's overnight.  Note that the patient chronically has low
blood pressure.

It was decided that the patient would be discharged to
