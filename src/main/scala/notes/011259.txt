has cleared

GI STUDIES:
[**2-22**] EGD- 4 cords of grade III varices were seen starting at 30
cm from the incisors in the lower third of the esophagus. There
were stigmata of recent bleeding. 3 bands were successfully
placed. Localized mosaic appearance of the mucosa was noted in
the fundus. These findings are compatible with portal
gastropathy
*
[**2-22**] 2nd EGD- Varices were seen in the esophagus. They were not
actively bleeding. The 3 previous bands were still present and
secure. There was no bleeding from this area. The varices
extended from the GE jcn to approximately 20 cm
.
[**3-2**] 3rd EGD - 4 cords of grade II-III varices were seen in the
middle third of the esophagus and lower third of the esophagus.
The varices were not bleeding. No previously placed bands were
found. A small ulcer on a previously banded site was present. 4
bands were successfully placed.  Diffuse erythema, granularity
and mosaic appearance of the mucosa with no bleeding were noted
in the stomach. These findings are compatible with portal
gastropathy.
*
[**3-12**] 4th EGD - Grade II varices seen in middle third of esophagus
and lower third of esophagus. Varices not bleeding. Ulceration
seen on previously banded sights in lower third. Too soon to
repeat banding, will need repeat EGD in ~10 days.

Brief Hospital Course:
At the outside hospital, the patient was initially noted to have
significant metabolic acidosis (ABG 7.15/15/200; bicarb < 10).
Systolic BP in the 60s. Hct 20. O2 saturation 84% on 100% NRB.
Patient was intubated to protect his airway given his mental
status changes, given 3 U PRBCS, 2 FFP, and started on
octeotride gtt. He was also given 5units IV insulin, 1 amp D50,
1 amp bicarb, and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for urgent EGD and ICU
care.
.
#GI BLEED:
The initial EGD done in the ER at [**Hospital1 18**] showed 3 varices, 1
bleeding. The patient had all 3 varices banded. He was also
transfused an additional 1 U PRBC and 1 U FFP.  The patient was
transferred to the ICU and on HD#1 vomited > 500 cc bright red
blood. A repeat endoscopy revealed bands still in place and no
further active bleeding seen. His Hct stabilized at 26.0 up from
24 on arrival and up from 20 at [**Hospital1 **].  Another EGD
on HD#10 showed non-bleeding varicies and 4 additional bands
were placed.  The patient was maintained on protonix and nadolol
to control his portal hypertension.  The plan was made for the
patient to have another EGD performed on [**2108-3-12**] to assess the
need for more banding. This study was performed and showed
continued varices in esophagus and ulceration on one of the
previously banded areas but no active bleeding. The patient will
have another EGD in approximately 10 days to reassess. In the
interim he will remain on protonix and carafate.
.
#BACTEREMIA:
The patient developed hypotension and fever, thought to be
secondary sepsis, therefore patient was pancultured, revealing
two different morphologies of MRSA from sputum and blood as well
as 1/2 bottles of enterococcal bacteremia. Patient was started
on pressors including
