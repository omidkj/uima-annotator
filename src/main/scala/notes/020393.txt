PET Scan:
Multiple new FDG-avid mediastinal, hilar, liver, and soft tissue
lesions
consistent with progression of disease.  Lytic lesion in the
proximal left femur with evidence of cortical breakthrough
placing the patient at high risk for pathologic fracture.
Interval resolution of two right upper lobe spiculated opacities
and non-visualization of two right lower lobe nodules.
.
L thigh xray: Large lytic intratrochanteric lesion (33mm in
diamater). No pathologic fracture

Brief Hospital Course:
60 year old male with progressive metastatic lung cancer and
membranous nephropathy who presents with left thigh pain in the
setting of a new left femur lytic lesion.
.
1.  Left lytic femoral bone lesion/fracture:  Pt was found to
have a lytic lesion in the intertrochanteric left femur on
admission.  Radiation oncology was consulted the following day
and recommended radiation.  Orthopedics was also consulted the
following day and at the time it was felt that given the pt's
comorbities that surgery to stabilize the weight-bearing bone
would be risky and recovery would be difficult.  The patient and
his family decided to defer surgery and proceed with radiation
therapy.  The patient was immediately placed on
non-weight-bearing for his left lower extremity; the patient
started with his activity restricted to bedrest and as he did
well, he graduated to out of bed with walker and assist per
orthopedic recommendations.  Physical therapy also worked with
the patient.
.
Unfortunately, the patient sustained a traumatic pathologic
fracture while in the hospital when he fell.  Pt was then found
to have low blood pressure, and was transferred to the intensive
care unit.  He was placed on vasopressors, and treated for a
presumed penumonia.  He was found to have a perifracture
hematoma and was transfused 4 units of PRBCs.  His plavix was
held.  His blood pressure stabilized and he was transferred back
to the oncology floor.
.
After a long discussion involving the primary oncology team and
orthopedics, given the risks of operating, the family decided to
defer surgery for now and complete radiation therapy. Mortality
from surgery was estimated to be 40-50%. Radiation therapy was
resumed.  Patient continued to work with physical therapy.  Pt
received palidronate on [**2159-12-12**]. Repeat xray films of hip,
femur and knee revealed minimal change since time of fracture.
Pt will be discharged to [**Hospital1 **] for rehabilitation.
.
2.  Chronic renal failure:  Pt has history of membranous
nephropathy associated with malignancy.  Although his creatinine
was elevated, his urine protein/Cr actually improved to his
previous results.  Nephrology was consulted and recommended
holding his home diuretics (bumetanide, HCTTZ) but continuing
with ACEI/[**Last Name (un) **] and prednisone with bactrim for PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 1102**].
His creatinine improved.  His HCTZ and bumetanide were re-added
as his BP rose. However, he again became hypotensive to 70's and
all antihypertensives were held.  Creatinine was followed
carefully with these additions and remained at his baseline.
.
3.  Hospital-acquired pneumonia, RLL:  His sputum culture grew
Pseudomonas aeroginosa.  He was treated with a 2 week course of
Zosyn. After completing his course patient was intermittiently
hypotensive and tachycardic. There was concern for sepsis and
cultures were sent. Sputum grew out sparse gram negative rods
and patient was started on 2 week course of ceftazidime because
of concern for partially treated pseudomonal pneumonia
(sensitivities to Zosyn were borderline). CT chest was completed
that showed worsening of his lung cancer, scarring secondary to
radiation and areas of persistent pneumonia. Out of concern for
fungal source, pulmonary was consulted. Patient's blood
pressures stabilized and pulmonary felt there was no indication
to bronch patient. His blood pressure stabilized, and He was
sent out to complete a two-week course of IV ceftazidime.
.
4.  COPD:  Pt appears to have wheezing at baseline.  He was
treated with ipatropium and albuterol nebulizers.  Albuterol
nebulizers were changed to levalbuterol nebulizers given the
patient's baseline tachycardia.  During his stay at ICU, he was
given a steroid burst which was tapered back to his home dose of
prednisone.
.
5. Hypertension:  After returning from the ICU, pt was noted to
have high blood pressure.  He was placed back on his complete
home regimen of ACEI, [**Last Name (un) **], HCTZ, and bumetanide.  Beta blockers
were avoided given his poor respiratory status and past records
noting inability to tolerate beta blockers.  However blood
pressure again became tenuous requiring boluses with IV fluids.
Therefore all antihypertensives were held. At time of discharge,
blood pressure ranged from 90-130 systolic.
.
6. Hyperglycemia:  This is likely due to steroids and
olanzapine.  His home glipizide was held and he was placed on a
Humalog insulin sliding scale while in the hospital.
.
7. CHF: Pt was maintained on home regimen of ACEI/[**Last Name (un) **], HCTZ, and
Bumetanide.  He was maintained on a low sodium diet, but all
antihypertensives were held as blood pressure was low.
.
8. CAD:  Pt was continued on his home regimen of statin,
ACEI/[**Last Name (un) **].  Plavix was held after his perifracture hematoma.  He
is allergic to ASA. BP meds held.
.
9. Schizophrenia and Paranoia:  Pt was continued on his
outpatient regimen of olanzapine, lorazepam, and fluphenazine.
His outpatient psychiatrist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 10166**] was contact[**Name (NI) **].  [**Name2 (NI) **] changes
were made to his regimen and patient did not have any auditory
hallucinations while in house.
