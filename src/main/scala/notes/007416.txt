HISTORY OF PRESENTING ILLNESS

This patient is a 82 year old female who complains of
TRAUMA TRANSFER. time seen is 1052 P.m. The patient was a
restrained driver of a head-on car accident at 2 PM. sHe is
transferred from [**Hospital3 **]. There is no loss of

[**2131-2-22**]: chest x-ray:


IMPRESSION: Mild pulmonary edema. No pneumothorax. Multilevel
right rib
fractures, better visualized in the concurrent outside hospital
trauma torso CT

[**2131-2-22**]: ct of the c-spine:

 IMPRESSION:
1. No acute cervical fracture or malalignment.
2. Non-displaced right anterior first rib fracture.

[**2131-2-22**]: cat scan of the head:

 IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial traumatic injury. Age-related
global
atrophy

[**2131-2-22**]: cat scan of the abdomen:

  Multilevel non-displaced right rib fractures at 1st, 2nd, 4th,
and possibly 3rd and 5th.
2. No PTX or lung contusion. No intrathoracic vascular injury
3. Right anterior chest wall soft tissue contusion.
4. Posterior linear splenic lucency (image 3:56), without
perisplenic
hematoma, making it less likely to represent a splenic
laceration. Otherwise no solid organ injury.
5. Right superior and inferior pubic rami fractures, minimally
displaced.
Small adjacent hematoma.
6. L2 and L4 compression deformities, of uncertain chronicity,
but probably old

[**2131-2-22**]: cat scan of the lower extremities:

Schatzker type 3 fracture with depression of the lateral tibial
plateau of
the right lower extremity with lipohemarthrosis and small
anterior soft tissue hematoma.
2. Large left lower extremity hematoma with intramuscular
involvement of the vastus medialis oblique muscle without
evidence for definite fracture.
3. Diffuse osteopenia limits assessment of subtle fractures and
given the
extent of soft tissue hematomas, MRI of the bilateral knees can
be performed for further evaluation.

[**2131-2-23**]:  x-ray of the right knee:

IMPRESSION: Nondisplaced lateral tibial plateau fracture with
associated
moderate lipohemarthrosis.

[**2131-2-23**]:  chest x-ray:

1. Mild-to-moderate volume overload. Bibasilar opacities, likely

atelectasis, although superimposed infection cannot be excluded.


2. No pneumothorax

[**2131-2-23**]: cat scan of sinus and mandible:

Mild deformity of the right-sided nasal bone likely a subtle
fracture of
undetermined age.

[**2131-2-24**]: Echo:

IMPRESSION: Right ventricular cavity enlargement with mild free
wall hypokinesis. Pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Mild-moderate tricuspid regurgitation. Preserved regional and
global left ventricular systolic function.
This constellation of findings is suggestive of a primary
pulmonary process (e.g., pulmonary embolism, bronchospasm, or a
chronic condition such as sleep apnea, COPD, etc.)

[**2131-2-24**]: chest x-ray:

IMPRESSION: Worsening pulmonary edema

[**2131-2-24**]: chest x-ray:

FRONTAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH: No pneumothorax is appreciated. The
cardiomediastinal silhouette is slightly decreased in size.
Diffuse
ground-glass opacity and vascular congestion has also mildly
decreased
consistent with mild improvement of a moderate degree of
pulmonary edema.
There are small bilateral pleural effusions with associated
atelectasis.
There is a small hiatal hernia

[**2131-2-25**]:  chest x-ray:

FRONTAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH: The cardiomediastinal silhouette is
stable.
Ground-glass opacity and vascular congestion continues to mildly
decrease,
consistent with improving pulmonary edema. There are small
bilateral pleural effusions as well as streaky left retrocardiac
opacity, which likely represent atelectasis. A moderate sized
hiatal hernia is also noted.

[**2131-2-26**]:  chest x-ray:

 FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, the
pre-existing and
pre-described pleural effusions have slightly increased in
extent. Also
increased is a small retrocardiac atelectasis. Minimal
overhydration and
borderline size of the cardiac silhouette. No newly appeared
focal
parenchymal opacities. No pneumothorax.








Brief Hospital Course:
  82 year old restrained driver admitted to the Acute care
service after being involved in a motor vehicle [**Last Name (un) 8886**].
Prior to her admission, she was hypotensive and required
intravenous fluids and packed red blood cells. Upon admission,
she was made NPO, had intravenous fluids started, and  imaging
studies of her neck, chest, and abdomen.  She was reported to
have a subtle non-displaced nasal fracture, right tibial plateau
fracture, and a pelvic fracture.  She also sustained right rib
fractures.  Orthopedics was consulted because of the extent of
her injuries and recommended a left knee immobilizer.  The
pelvic fracture was reported to be stable and managed
