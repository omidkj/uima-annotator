Brief Hospital Course:
78 y/o man admitted to the medicine service with ascending
cholangitis.  Hospital course outlined by problem below:

1. Cholangitis
Pt being transferred from [**Hospital1 392**] with cholangitis.  At [**Hospital1 392**],
ERCP showed a mobile mass obstructing the common bile duct.  He
was sent here for further care with the possiblity of having
parasites in his CBD.  Here he taken directly to the ERCP suite
where a biliary stent was placed with resulting relief in his
obstruction.  On admission he had an elevated WBC with 13%
bandemia, and fever to 101 F.   Pt with a lactate of 4.4 in the
ED; hemodynamically stable on admission to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].  Grew GNRs
in [**2-22**] blood cx's which was isolated as pansensitive Klebsiella.
 His initial ABx coverage with Unasyn 3g IV q8 was changed to
Levaquin.  In fectious disease was consulted given the concern
that he could have a parasitic infection involving his biliary
tree.  Given his demographics (from [**Location (un) 6847**]) they felt that
Clonorchis sinensis was the most likely pathogen and recommended
treating with praziquantel.  This was given to him after a
biliary aspirate was obtained.  SEveral days after his initial
ERCP and stent procedure, he was taken back for sphincterotomy
and balloon sweep of his biliary tree.  Three common bile duct
stones were removed and there were no worms that were retreived.
 A bile aspirate was sent for analysis and grew Staph Aureus and
Enterococcus.  The ova and parasite analysis was not performed
by the time he was discharged and should be followed up by his
primary care physician.  [**Name10 (NameIs) 2321**] this, he was treated
empirically with praziquantel and his antibiotics were adjusted
to ciprofloxacin total course of 12 days after his
sphinchterotomy.  He remained afebrile with resolution of his
obstruction and transaminitis.  His last set of surveillance
blood cultures drawn [**2152-5-12**] were still sterile at the time of
his discharge but should be followed up to ensure negative
results.  HE WILL ALSO NEED TO BE SEEN IN OUR SURGERY CLINIC TO
EVALUATE HIM FOR A CHOLECYSTECTOMY IN 6 WEEKS.

2. Parasite in bile duct - as above.
Pt with a visualized mobile filling defects which changed shape
in the bile duct during ERCP that seemed consistant with
parasites in the bile duct.  Unclear exact parasite, ddx
includes Clonorchis, echinococcus, ascaris.  No eosinophilia was
noted on dif.  Due to his background from [**Location (un) 6847**], clonorchis
most likely.  O&P x3 were sent but remained (-).  Repeat ERCP
showed no worm, but was treated with praziquantel regardless.
Bile aspirite sent for O&P; pending upon discharge.  Likely the
"mobile filling defect" was a stone that moved or the patient
moved during the cholangiogram.

3. Liver mass
Patient with a previously visualized liver mass on Abd CT from
OSH in [**1-/2152**] that was not visualized on U/S today at OSH.  Bx
was inconclusive with only necrotic elements.  DDx includes
prior malignancy that necrosed, vs prior Klebsiella liver
abscess that healed with Abx treatment, vs nonvisualized mass.
An MRI/MCRP was obtained that showed multiple lesions within the
liver that enhanced peripherally, however in the setting of
cholangitis it could not be determined if they were benign
lesions, metastatic lesions, or early abscesses.  Given his
clinical stability, it was felt that he would need his liver
REIMAGED WITH A CONTRAST ABDOMINAL CT IN 6 WEEKS to allow better
visibility.

4. CAD
No ischemia was noted during this admission with a nml EKG; nml
CEs (-) x1 at OSH.  His statin was continued, but his ASA was
held to perform a sphincterotomy.  After consultation with his
cardiologist, his Plavix was discontinued permanently as he was
greater than 1 year post-[**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 5175**].
.
5. Rhythm - Pt with hx of PAF  He had a rapid ventricular
response in the setting of his infection.  He converted to
normal sinus rhythm spontaneously with resolution of his
infection.  He was continued on his amiodarone.  He does have
hyperthyroidism.  Endocrine was consulted who felt this was
related to amiodarone induced thyrotoxicosis.  He will need
follow up with endocrinology or cardiology when he leaves.
.
6. UTI - Pt with evidence of UTI on U/A.  He had a foley when he
arrived.  HE was being treated with Unasyn for cholangitis,which
also covered the UTI. Foley was removed once his cholangitis
resolved.
.
7. Acute on CRF - during infection, which resolved after his
infection was treated.
.
8. Hyperthyroidism - remained asymptomatic.  Per endocrinology
consult, felt related to amiodarone toxicity.  REcommended
continuing amiodarone for now.  No oral medciations were given
for hyperthyroidism given their relative [**Name (NI) 47436**] in
the setting of hepatitis.  This should be reconsidered when he
has recovered from his cholangitis fully and could be done
through an outpatient endocrinology consult.
