CT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST; CT PELVIS W/CONTRAST

Reason: CT with RECTAL contrast to rule out distal obstructive
proce
Field of view: 46 Contrast: OPTIRAY

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
54F with large bowel obstruction
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
CT with RECTAL contrast to rule out distal obstructive process
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: IV dye allergy

INDICATION: Plain film concerning for large bowel obstruction.

COMPARISON: CT scan dated [**2183-10-30**] and plain films dated
[**2183-11-20**].

TECHNIQUE: MDCT acquired images of the abdomen and pelvis were
obtained after the administration of IV, oral, and rectal
contrast. Multiplanar reformatted images were also obtained.

CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST
The imaged portions of the lung bases are clear. There is
diffuse fatty infiltration of the liver. There is a gallstone
within the gallbladder. The pancreas and spleen are
unremarkable. The adrenal glands are normal. There are multiple
left renal cysts and a right renal lesion that is too small to
characterize, that probably represents a cyst.

There is dilatation of the cecum with diameter measuring up to
12.3 cm. Oral contrast is present within the cecum. No dilated
loops of small bowel are seen. Note is made of subtle
pneumatosis of the cecum with no wall edema. The transverse
colon measures up to 7.8 cm, only mildly dilated by size
criteria with no wall edema or pneumatosis. There is a focal
narrowing of the lumen of the sigmoid flexure with adjacent
peritoneal metastasis producing a low-grade obstruction at this
location. The descending colon is of normal size. There is an
inflammatory mass located at the mid-upper pelvis (series 5,
image 69). Rectal contrast material passes freely through the
rectum and sigmoid colon to the level of this inflammatory mass
(series 7, image 24). Approximately 1 liter of contrast was
given. There is no intra-abdominal free air. There is no
mesenteric or portal venous gas. The superior mesenteric artery,
celiac artery, and inferior mesenteric arteries all appear
patent.

CT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST: The bladder is unremarkable.
The patient is status post TAHBSO. There is no pelvic free
fluid. Rectum is unremarkable with rectal tube in place.

Bone windows reveal no suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions.
There are degenerative changes.

IMPRESSION:
1) Dilatation of the cecum with measurement up to 12.3 cm, and
only mild dilatation of the transverse colon, with the
descending colon being of normal diameter. There is a focal area
of mild luminal narrowing at the splenic flexure with adjacent
mesenteric/serosal metastasis. More inferiorly, in the mid
pelvis there is an ill-defined mesenteric metastatic lesion,
with rectal contrast noted to clearly pass from the rectum
through the sigmoid colon up to the level of this mass. No
rectal contrast could be passed through this level. Notably,
there is residual stool present within the rectum and sigmoid
colon. Taken together, findings are suggestive of at least a
partial large bowel obstruction. Complete or high-grade
obstruction cannot be excluded as rectal contrast material was
not noted to pass through the level of this inflammatory mass.
Further evaluation could be performed with a barium enema to
assess for passage of contrast through this level.

2) Pneumatosis is noted of the cecum, without associated wall
edema. The significance of this finding is not certain. It is
not felt to be likely due to ischemia. Correlate clinically.

KUB
-------
Compared to CT torso of [**2183-10-30**]. There is diffuse distention of
the large bowel to the level of the distal sigmoid colon, at
which point there appears to be an abrupt cut off which
corresponds to an area of serosal implant seen on the prior CT
of [**2183-10-30**]. Overall, the findings are highly concerning for
distal large bowel obstruction. The large bowel measures up to
10 cm in maximum diameter involving the transverse and hepatic
flexure. No evidence of free intraperitoneal air.

IMPRESSION: Findings highly suspicious for distal large bowel
obstruction. Findings discussed with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 916**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] after the
study.
