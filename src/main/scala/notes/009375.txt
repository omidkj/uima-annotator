Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3531**]
Chief Complaint:
rigors, tachycardia, hypertension

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
flexible bronchoscopy

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 69 year old woman with fibrosing mediastinitis
s/p metallic stent in left mainstem bronchus in [**2181**]. She
presented to [**Hospital1 18**] for an outpatient bronchoscopy. She has had
recurrent respiratory tract infections, especially over the last
several months, worsening DOE, and sputum production. She has
had multiple respiratory infections requiring antibiotics. She
reports fevers up to 101 about twice per week. Last week, a CT
scan at an OSH showed worsening bilateral infiltrates suspicious
for infection as well as a possible necrotic/cystic lesion in
her posterior LLL. She was scheduled for outpatient bronchoscopy
at [**Hospital1 18**].
.
She underwent bronchoscopy today. She had some supraglottic
edema, but her stent was patent. However, they were unable to
pass the scope beyond the stent. It appears narrow but patent
beyond the stent. She developed rigors and hypertension to
160s-200 systolic after the bronchoscopy as well as SVT with
rates to 140s. She was given 12.5mg demerol and 5mg lopressor
with good effect. Because of this and O2 sats requiring 10L of
O2 by facemask, she was placed in the ICU for monitoring, IV
antibiotics, and HR control.
Currently, she denies LH, CP, SOB, N/V, abd pain, diarrhea,
palpitations. She has a slight HA.


Past Medical History:
Per OMR:
# fibrosing mediastinitis:  She was completely healthy until
[**2172**] when she developed SOB/chest tightness. She was found to
have bilateral pleural effusion, mediastinal lymphadenopathy,
submandibular LN, and progressive lung infiltrates, and
bilateral eye puffiness. Workup at that time ([**2172**])
     1) bilateral thoracentesis negative for malignancy/lymphoma
     2) Left lung wedge Bx showed acute organizing pneumonia,
     lymphoid hyperplasia, and acute organizing pleuritis.
     3) Mediastinoscopy: edematoues narrow spaced mediastinum
     with a lot of adhesions. LN  biopsied non-diagnostic
     4) Salivary G Bx: mixed lymphoplasmacytic infiltration with
     no malignancy.
Ms. [**Known lastname **] was started on prednisone [**2173**]. Her eye symptoms
reverted but with worsening of her respiratory symptoms and
pulmonary infiltrates. PFT at that time revealed moderate
restrictive, severe obstructive pattern with DLCO compromise.
   - Underwent another lung bx ( [**2173**]) which showed atypical
     lymphprolifirative process with fibrosis, however, no
specific diagnosis made. Meanwhile, CTD serology came back
positive for [**Doctor First Name **] (1:160), RNP (1:[**2172**]), mildly positive RF,
elevated ACE level(191).
   - Due to progression of her symptoms, she was started on
Cytoxan with excellent clinical response with stabilization of
her radiological picture.
   - Continued to do well, and her Cytoxan was discontinued in
[**2176**] (? related to neutropenia)
   - She did well off medications until mid [**2180**] when she
started to deteriorate again clinically, radiologically
(infiltrate and LMS critical stenosis), and physiologically.
   - Refered to [**Hospital1 18**] mid [**2181**] for stent placement in the LMS

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 69 year old woman with fibrosing mediastinitis.
She was admitted to the MICU after developing fevers, rigors,
hypertension, and hypoxia during an  outpatient bronchoscopy.
.
# Fevers/rigors/pneumonia: Ms. [**Known lastname **] developed fevers and
rigors following her bronchoscopy. She was covered for a
possible pneumonia with vancomycin, Zosyn, and levofloxacin. The
fever was thought to be a combination of post-bronchoscopy
reaction from local inflammatory response and possible
pneumonia. She remained afebrile for the rest of the admission.
She was discharged on levofloxacin.
.
# Fibrosing mediastinitis: Her home dose of prednisone 10mg was
continued. Interventional pulmonary followed her throughout the
admission. She was scheduled for a follow up in rheumatology
after discharge.
.
# Hypoxia: Ms. [**Known lastname **] was initially on 10 L post-procedure. She
was weaned down to room air. However, her oxygen would
desaturate during exertion. She was discharged on home oxygen.
.
# SVT: Ms. [**Known lastname **] developed episodes of SVT post-procedure.
These episodes correlated with hypoxia. During the first
episode, she responded to IV metoprolol. A subsequent episode
resolved on its own without intervention. On further
questioning, Ms. [**Known lastname **] may have been having these episodes at
home. She was discharged on home oxygen.
.
# Hypertension: She had elevated blood pressures post-procedure.
She remained normotensive throughout the rest of the admission.
.
Prophylaxis: Ms. [**Known lastname **] received subcutaneous heparin.
.
Code: Ms. [**Known lastname **] was a full code.

She stopped her diltiazem and levothyroxine of her own [**Location (un) **] in
[**2182-2-8**])


Discharge Medications:
1. Oxygen
