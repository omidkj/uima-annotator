floridly positive stool. He was started on a protonix drip with
a bolus and GI was consulted. Hct returned at 24 from a recent

of note, his recent medical history is as follows: He had
undergone catheterization in [**2115-5-5**], with two drug-eluting
stents placed.  He has no cough.  No shortness of breath.  He
had a chest x-ray done as per his primary care physician.  [**Name10 (NameIs) 6**]
abnormality was detected in the left upper lobe and a CT of the
chest was done on [**2116-1-3**].  He had a CT of the chest,
which revealed a 2.2 cm left upper lobe nodule as well as
mediastinal lymph node metastasis, skeletal metastasis,
lymphangitic carcinomatosis.  He had a bronchoscopy with lymph
node biopsy on [**2116-1-17**].  Transbronchial biopsy of the
left upper lobe mass revealed adenocarcinoma of the lung, lymph
node station 4R, 4L, 7, and 11 were biopsied and revealed
adenocarcinoma.  Prior to his biopsy, the prasugrel was stopped
and after the procedure, he was loaded with 60 mg of prasugrel
and then told to resume taking it at 10 mg daily.  He had
pink-tinged sputum for several days after the biopsy and this
progressed to hemoptysis.  On [**2116-1-22**], and [**2116-1-23**], he came to the emergency room with hemoptysis with no
intervention done at that time and he was discharged.  This
patient had a PET CT, which revealed a 2.2 cm left upper lobe
nodule.  There was also seen extensive FDG avid mediastinal,
hilar, and supraclavicular lymphadenopathy, osseous metastatic
involvement including lytic inferior sternal fracture at the
risk of pathologic fracture, and also several lytic and
sclerotic
lesions of the vertebrae, most prominent at T6.
.
On arrival to the MICU, the patient was stable, complaining of
no pain.  The patient received 2U packed red cells and had an
EGD by GI which did not demonstrate an obvious source for
bleeding, but did have significant clot in stomach that was
unable to be totally cleared.

- [**12/2115**]: developed right-sided chest pain.  CXR was abnormal
and underwent CT on [**2116-1-3**] which showed a 2.2 cm left upper
lobe lung nodule as well as mediastinal lymph node metastases,
skeletal metastases and lymphangitic carcinomatosis.
- [**2116-1-17**]: bronchoscopy with lymph node biopsy.  Transbronchial
biopsy of the left upper lobe mass was consistent with
adenocarcinoma of the lung.  The carcinoma cells stained
positive for TTF-1 and negative for CK5/6, p63, and
thyroglobulin.  Lymph node stations 4R, 4L, 7 and 11 were
biopsied and were all positive for adenocarcinoma.

lung nodule.  He was also seen to have extensive FDG avid
mediastinal, hilar, and supraclavicular lymphadenopathy, osseous
metastatic involvement included a lytic inferior sternal
fracture at the risk of pathologic fracture and also several
