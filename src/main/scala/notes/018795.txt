Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2969**]
Chief Complaint:
pain with eating

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
S/p L thoracotomy, LOA, and repair of diaphragmatic hernia on
[**2160-11-18**]. (Paraesophageal diaphragmatic hernia found
incidentally on CXR, elective surgery scheduled).


History of Present Illness:
42-year-old gentleman with a [**Known lastname **]
complicated upper gastrointestinal history. He presented over
10 years ago with nutcracker esophagus and underwent a [**Known lastname **]
esophageal myotomy with [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 13989**] fundoplication. This was
complicated by severe erosive esophagitis and eventually an
undilatable stricture requiring transhiatal esophagectomy.
This was subsequently complicated by severe and unrelenting
bile reflux and was treated with biliary diversion and a Roux-
en-Y gastrojejunostomy. Approximately 10 months ago, he
underwent a procedure to revise the gastrojejunostomy which
was stenotic. He has continued to have inability to aliment
himself orally with a postprandial severe pain. Radiographic
and endoscopic examinations revealed an incarcerated portion
of bowel in the chest to the level the main pulmonary artery.
There appears to be a bezoar in the small bowel component of
this and I am concerned that this is an incarcerated hernia
involving part of the colon but also part of the Roux-en-Y
limb. I recommended  reduction of this hernia and the
possible need to revise again the gastrojejunostomy. This was
planned as a joint procedure between myself, Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 957**]. The patient agreed to the treatment plan.


Past Medical History:
s/p Ex-lap with lysis of adhesions, gastrojejunostomy and
feeding jejunostomy [**12-12**]
Erosive esophagitis
Nutcracker esophagus
s/p Myotomy [**2151**]

rehab facility since [**6-11**]; he reprots a 20 pack year smoking
history and currently smokes one pack/day.  He denies etoh and

RADIOLOGY  Final Report

CTA CHEST W&W/O C &RECONS  [**2160-11-24**] 5:05 PM

CTA CHEST W&W/O C &RECONS; CT 100CC NON IONIC CONTRAST

Reason: spiral Chest Ct to r/o pulmonary embolism- plaese obtain
sca
Contrast: OPTIRAY

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
42 year old man with diaphragmatic hernia repair- POD 6- now w/
desat requiring high fio2
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
spiral Chest Ct to r/o pulmonary embolism- plaese obtain scan at
4pm
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.

INDICATION: Diaphragmatic hernia repair, postop day 6 with
desaturation, evaluate for pulmonary embolus.

COMPARISON: [**2159-12-5**].

TECHNIQUE: Axial MDCT images were obtained through the chest
prior to and following the administration of 100 cc of
intravenous Optiray in the pulmonary arterial phase. Additional
coronal and sagittal reformations are provided.

CONTRAST: Intravenous nonionic contrast was administered due to
the rapid rate of bolus injection required for this examination.

CT OF THE CHEST WITHOUT AND WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: There is
marked enlargement of the main and right and left main pulmonary
arteries consistent with pulmonary arterial hypertension. The
left main pulmonary artery measures 5.2 cm in diameter
(prevously 4.8 cm) and the main pulmonary artery has increased
from 3.4 cm to 4.1 cm in diameter at the level of the carina.
No definite filling defects are identified within the pulmonary
arteries to suggest pulmonary embolus.

The patient is status post esophagectomy with a large portion of
the stomach located within the thorax. Surgical clips are seen
within the mediastinum consistent with postoperative change. The
central airways appear patent. There are bilateral pleural
effusions of moderate size which appear partially loculated and
contain multiple air-fluid levels, and atelectasis of the left
lower lobe. There is additional atelectasis within the lingula.
Multifocal patchy ground- glass opacity and interlobular septal
thickening is seen in a geographic distribution involving
primarily the right upper and lower lobes and left upper lobe.
There is additional patchy airspace consolidation within the
lung apices. The heart and pericardium appear unremarkable.

There are numerous subcentimeter mediastinal, hilar, and
axillary lymph nodes not individually meeting criteria for
pathologic enlargement. An additional right hilar lymph node
measures 2.4 x 1.6 cm.

Limited images of the upper abdomen, including limited images of
the liver and spleen, appear unremarkable.

BONE WINDOWS: Bone windows demonstrate no evidence of suspicious
lytic or sclerotic osseous lesions.

MULTIPLANAR REFORMATS: Coronal and sagittal reformations
demonstrate marked enlargement of the pulmonary arteries without
evidence of filling defects to suggest pulmonary embolus.

IMPRESSION:
1. No pulmonary embolus.
2. Marked enlargement of the pulmonary arteries, consistent with
pulmonary arterial hypertension.
3. Bilateral pleural effusions and ground- glass opacity and
interlobular septal thickening suggests pulmonary edema which
may be cardiogenic or noncardiogenic.
4. Loculated bilateral pleural effusions with air-fluid levels
on the left. Bibasilar atelectasis.

STUDY: Barium esophagram.

COMPARISON: None.

INDICATION: 42-year-old man with distal esophagectomy and

BARIUM ESOPHAGRAM: Nonionic(Optiray) contrast assed freely
through the esophagus with no evidence for extraluminal
extravasation. The patient was then administered barium orally.
Barium flowed freely through the esophagus with no evidence for
destruction detected. No hiatus hernia or GE reflux was
demonstrated. No extraluminal extravasation was demonstrated.
