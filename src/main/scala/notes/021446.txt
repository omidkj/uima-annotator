Bright red blood per ostomy

History of Present Illness:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 2643**] is a 60 year old woman with EtOH cirrhosis
(Child's class B) with known gastric varices who is s/p
colectomy/ileostomy for ischemic colitis on [**2122-7-10**]. She was
just
discharged 3 days ago after being hospitalized [**Date range (1) 31232**] for
failure to thrive, lower extremity edema, SBP, and concern for
portal vein thrombosis.

She returns today after she developed bright red bleeding from
her ostomy. She was scheduled for a [**Hospital 702**] clinic appointment
today and says that as she got up from bed to put on her clothes
and shoes, she noticed blood dripping on the floor. She looked
down and saw bright red blood within her ostomy bag and leaking
out. She could not tell whether the bleeding was from the stoma
itself or from around the stoma. She approximates the quantity
of
blood to be about a cup and a half. Her husband told her to
quickly lay down again and the bleeding seemed to subside.

She denies any trauma to her ostomy and says she has not changed
her appliance since leaving the hospital and today was supposed
to be the day she was to change it. The ostomy itself is not
painful but she does endorse epigastric abdominal pain and pain
in the RUQ superior to the ostomy. However, this pain has been
chronic and is stable from prior. The last time she was
hospitalized, her LFTs were normal and RUQ ultrasound was
unremarkable. She denies fever, chills, vomiting, dysuria,
dizziness/lightheadedness. She does endorse nausea when she
tries
to eat but says this has been chronic and persistent since her
surgery. She says she is unable to even brush her teeth without
feeling like gagging. She has not vomited recently.

Her hct today is 24.5 which is stable from her discharge hct of
24.9.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 2643**] is a 60 woman with EtOH cirrhosis and known gastric
varices s/p colectomy/ileostomy who presented with bright red
bleeding from her ostomy.  On admission to the Transplant
Surgery service, there was no active bleeding from her stoma.
Serial hematocrits were checked, all of which remained stable
from her last admission.  She was maintained on a clear liquid
diet, with her tube feedings held.

A Gastroenterology/Hepatology consult was obtained, and on
hospital day #3 she underwent EGD to evaluate for parastomal
varices.  No active bleeding was identified.  One lower
esophageal varix was banded, however, no parastomal varices were
visualized.  Her Dobhoff feeding tube came out during the
procedure and thus had to be reinserted, with IR assisting with
post-pyloric positioning.  Her tube feedings were restarted.

She had remained without active bleeding since admission, and
her hematocrit had remained stable.  On hospital day #4 she was
deemed appropriate for discharge, with arrangements made for
continued VNA services to assist with ostomy care and tube
feedings.
