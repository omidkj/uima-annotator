hematoma.

COMPARISON: [**2179-3-24**].

SINGLE UPRIGHT VIEW OF THE CHEST AT 5:00 A.M: The extreme
costophrenic angles
are excluded from the exam. However, the lungs are well expanded
and clear
without consolidation, evidence of pleural effusion, or
pneumothorax. Tiny
pleural effusions cannot be excluded. There is no cardiomegaly.
The hilar
and mediastinal contours are within normal limits. Pulmonary
vascularity is
normal. Soft tissue and bony structures are unremarkable.

IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.

The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.
