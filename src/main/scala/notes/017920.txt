History of Present Illness:
Pt is a 69 yo female with a history of 3VD CAD, s/p CABG in [**2169**]
and awaiting repeat, mixed systolic/diastolic CHF with EF
40-45%, who presented with 10 days of progressive dyspnea. 10
days prior to admission, pt felt dyspneic and a decrease in how
far she could walk. + new 2 pillow orthopnea. + subjective "low
grade fever," though did not measure it at home. + cough
productive of white frothy sputum. +2 pillow orthopnea, whereas
normally can lay flat. No PND. No LE edema.

Recent Cardiac cath [**2199-9-10**] showed diffuse 3 vessel disease,
severe mitral regurgitation, and mild systolic and diastolic
ventricular dysfunction. ECHO [**2199-8-27**] also showed severe MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 75827**]y reduced LV and RV systolic function. Pt is followed by
Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 487**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] of CT [**Doctor First Name **] at [**Hospital1 112**], and is to get repeat
CABG/MVR in near future once cleared by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 497**] for her esoph
varices (to have repeat EGD [**2198-12-17**] after recent banding), and
once her R axillary LAD etiology is determined (had negative
dissection with bx 1y PTA, was to have another recently but did
not make the appt because of her current illness.

Pt was admitted to the MICU as she was found to be in atrial
fibrillation with RVR, tachypnic, confused, and with a new renal
failure. She was initially on a diltiazem gtt for her atrial
fibrillation. She was seen by cardiology, and despite increasing
beta blocker and diltiazem, was persistently in afib with RVR.
Pt underwent ibutilide cardioversion with success on [**2199-12-11**].

On transfer to the regular medicine service, pt feels well. No
CP/SOB. No F/C/N/V.

Radiology:
Chest AP 12/26/06-1. Cardiomegaly with mild CHF.
2. Biapical scarring unchanged. By report, the patient has a
history of sarcoid.
3. No focal infiltrate identified.
4. Small nodular density left mid zone. See comment above.

Echo [**2200-12-10**]-There is mild regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction. Tissue velocity imaging E/e' is elevated (>15)
suggesting increased left ventricular filling pressure
(PCWP>18mmHg). Resting regional wall motion abnormalities
include basal to mid inferior and distal septal hypokinesis.
Right ventricular chamber size is normal. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is no aortic valve
stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. The
left ventricular inflow pattern suggests a restrictive filling
abnormality, with elevated left atrial pressure. The tricuspid
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is mild pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension.

Compared with the prior study (tape not available) of [**2199-8-27**],
overall left ventricular systolic function is probably similar
(however distal septal hypokinesis noted in the current study
but not in the prior report). Mitral regurgitation is now less
prominent. There is now a restrictive left ventricular filling
pattern.

Brief Hospital Course:
Pt is a 69 yo female with h/o 3VD CAD, s/p CABG in [**2169**] and
awaiting repeat, mixed systolic/diastolic CHF with EF 40-45%,
who presents with 10 days of progressive dyspnea, found to have
a fib with RVR, ARF, and increased ascites. She is s/p
cardioversion with ibutilide and had an EP ablation.

1. Cardiovascular:
a. [**Name (NI) 9520**] Pt was in Afib/Aflut and is s/p ibutilide conversion
to sinus rhythm when she was in the ICU. She was being rate
controlled with PO metoprolol which was being uptitrated but she
went back in to aflutter with RVR on HD 10. She maintained her
pressure and was put on a diltiazem drip, uptitrated to 15
units/hour. She spontaneously converted to normal sinus on HD 12
and had an EP study with ablation that day. Metoprolol was
continued and she was discha
