Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admited for a fall. In ED,her vital signs were
within normal range except an elevated BP of 178/100. CT head
did not show hemorrhage and CT of spine did not show a fracture.
CXR was concerning for PNA and she recieved Levaquin 250 mg X 1.
On admission she c/o of breast pain,and was treated for mastitis
with Clindamycin. She has currently received a 6 day regimen of
this mediciation and may continue for four more days. An
outpaitent mamogram of the breast bilaterally was recommended
again as the patient has yet to follow up on prior abnormal
mammogram.
.
In the hospital she was was noted to have HR in 150's. Rate
control was difficult to control on the floor and the patitent
required transfer to the MICU. In the MICU she was closely
monitored without any events. She was started on a Diltiazem
drip and was transitioned to oral verapramil. Also, based on a
CHADS score of 2 she was started on heparin drip. She remained
stable in the MICU and so she was transfered back to the floor.
.
In the wards the patient did not demonstrate signs of Afib on
telemetry monitoring or cardiovascular decompensation on
physical exam and she remained stable. She was transitioned from
verapramil to metoprolol for rate control. Appropriate control
was achieved with Metoprolol at 75 mg [**Hospital1 **]. This regimen appeared
sufficient for appropriate blood pressure control.
.
Because of the risk of bleeding secondary to this patients fall,
Heparin ggt was dicontinued. It was reasoned that the risk of
bleeding overweighed the risk of stroke secondary to
Afib/thrombus.
