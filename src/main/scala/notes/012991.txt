Admission Date:  [**2115-6-21**]       Discharge Date:  [**2115-6-27**]


Service:  BLUE SURGERY

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a [**Age over 90 **] year-old female who
was previously healthy who started complaining of abdominal
pain and bloating starting on the Sunday prior to admission.
The abdominal distention got worse over the next few days and
the patient went to an outside hospital.  She was found to
have a large sigmoid filled with air and a sigmoidoscopy was
performed with partial relief of obstruction.  She began to
pass flatus, have bowel movements and her distention
improved.  However, on the day prior to transfer the patient
had increasing distention and worsening of her abdominal
pain, therefore she was transferred to [**Hospital1 190**] for management of her sigmoid volvulus.  The
patient also noted a history of nausea and vomiting with no
fevers or chills.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Hypertension, history of upper GI
bleed after non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs use.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Significant for a left knee
replacement, right carpal tunnel.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1.  Captopril.
2.  Isopt SR.
3.  Dyazide.
4.  Paxil.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  She was afebrile.  Her vital signs
were stable.  Her blood pressure was elevated at 170/80.  She
is awake, alert and oriented.  Her lungs are clear.  Her
heart was regular.  Her abdomen was distended, tympanitic
with no guarding no focal tenderness.  However, she was
diffusely tender on examination.  Her rectal examination she
was guaiac negative with no masses.

LABORATORY:  White blood cell count 12.0, hematocrit 36.8,
platelet count 239.  Her chemistries were within normal
limits.  The patient had an echocardiogram done, which showed
an EF of 55%.  KUBs were done, which showed significant
sigmoid volvulus and was unimproved after the sigmoidoscopy,
therefore it was decided that the patient would be taken
emergently to the Operating Room for a sigmoid colectomy and
end colostomy.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was taken to the Operating Room
on [**2115-6-21**] where the operation was done.  See the operative
note for further details.  The patient was transferred to the
Intensive Care Unit postoperatively.  She did well.  The
patient required fluid boluses for low urine output, but her
urine output slowly improved.  She was kept NPO and an
nasogastric tube was placed and she continued to improve.
Her urine output was again continued to be monitored and she
continued to require fluid resuscitation.  On postoperative
day number two she was over 8 lites positive, therefore it
was decided that the patient should be diuresed.  Her white
count began trending down and her chemistries remained within
normal limits.  She was continued on Ceftriaxone and Flagyl
for coverage and her intravenous fluids were reduced.  She
continued to improve and her white count stayed elevated,
therefore a chest x-ray was done to rule out pneumonia.
Again the chest x-ray was totally normal and there was no
infectious changes noted, therefore the patient was continued
to be monitored.  Her diuresis was continued and she
continued to put out excellent urine.  She was given a
Duragesic patch as well as pain medications through the
intravenous for pain control and aggressive chest physical
therapy and incentive spirometry were done.  The patient was
able to be weaned off of her oxygen and did well from a
pulmonary standpoint.

The intrastromal nurse [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 4221**] for management and
changing of her stoma bag.  On postoperative day number four
her white count was elevated to 18.8, however, she continued
to be afebrile.  Her pulmonary issues were improved and she
was continued to be NPO.  At this time there was stool
production in the stoma, therefore she was started on a clear
liquid diet.  The patient also had a repeat white count that
was down the next day on postoperative number five to 9.3 and
therefore it was felt that her infectious causes were
improving.  Her antibiotics were stopped on postoperative day
number four and her diet was advanced to a low fat diet.  She
was encouraged to ambulate and continued to do well from a
respiratory standpoint.  She was placed back on all of her
home medications including her Verapamil, Captopril, Paxil
and Dyazide.  The patient did well and her blood pressure was
slightly better controlled at this time.  On postoperative
day number six her white count had reduced to 7.9 and her
chemistries were all within normal limits.  Therefore it was
felt that she was safe to be discharged to a rehab facility.
Her Foley was removed and she was eating by the time of
discharge.
