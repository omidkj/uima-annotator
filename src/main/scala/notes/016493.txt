Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2290**]
Chief Complaint:
unresponsiveness

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
88 y/o male with history of dementia, recent admissions to ED
for aggressive behavior/assault, type 2 diabetes, multiple CVA
with ? vascular dementia, and coronary artery disease, who was
found to be unresponsive to painful stimuli on routine night
time check at his facility ([**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 1785**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]). Patient recently
returned to [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 1785**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] after a ten day admission in the psych
[**Hospital1 **] of [**Hospital 68117**] Hospital for belligerence and aggressive
behavior. EMS found patient with sat of 80% on RA with
fingerstick that was unmeasureable (>500). Of note, gets
klonopin for sleep. A temperature of 102 was measured at the
facility today. Of note, patient is on prednisone 5 MG daily for
unknown reason.

Initial VS in the ED - not provided. Patient was hypotensive,
with sbps in the 90s and was given dexamethosone 10mg/ml, 1L
IVF, 10 units of regular insulin and vanc and zosyn. He was
placed on an NRB satting in the 90s.
.
Exam notable for unresponsiveness, that did not resolve with ED
managment. Patient was however protecting his airway, thus was
not intubated. Labs were notable for WBC 14.9, Hct 52.3, plt
225, INR 1.3, fibrinogen 816, glucose 676, Na 154, Hco3 17, AG
21, Cr 3.0, lactate 8.3, Stox negative. U/A not possible given
urethral meatus adhesion. EKG showing Sinus Tachycardia w/
non-specific ST changes in the anterolateral leads.

Imaging notable for head CT showing subacute vs chronic changes
to left parietal lobe. Overall, read as "Confluent
hypoattenuation in the left parietal region. Superiorly it
appears to spare the [**Doctor Last Name 352**] matter - suggesting vasogenic edema,
though inferiorly involves both [**Doctor Last Name 352**] and white matter. Unlikely
acute infarct given the time course of symptoms and extensive
abnormality on CT. Encephalomalacia in the superior-posterior
right frontal lobe. No hemorrhage. Cortical atrophy. Small
vessel ischemic changes."

CT torso was read as "bibasilar opacities, left > right, most
consistent with dependent atelectasis. No confluent
consolidation with air bronchograms. No pleural effusions. No
acute intrabdominal pathology. Sigmoid diverticulosis though no
acute diverticulitis." Overall concerning for LLL PNA vs
atelectasis.
.
Neurology was consulted who felt that imaging results were
likely chronic, did not recommend an LP, and recommended
admission to MICU.

Vitals on transfer were HR 87 BP 100/42 RR 20 Satting 94% on 4L.
On arrival to the MICU, the patient was vitally stable and had
two peripherals for access.

Review of systems: unable to obtain given patient
unresponsiveness.

CT Torso: 1. Bibasilar consolidations, left slightly greater
than right, findings most consistent with dependent atelectasis.
No pleural effusions.
2. Dense vascular calcifications involving the thoracic and
abdominal aorta
and coronary vasculature. 3. Nonobstructing punctate calculus in
the right kidney. 4. Sigmoid diverticulosis without evidence of
acute diverticulitis. 5. Enlarged prostate gland.

CT head: No acute intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect. Prior
infarcts, as above.

CXR [**2144-12-8**]: Increasing opacity in the left hemithorax is
concerning for an evolving infectious process.


Brief Hospital Course:
Goals of care: The patient was felt by his family to have poor
quality of life that had been ongoing since prior to admission.
A family meeting was had with the health care proxy present. At
that time it was decided to focus on comfort measures only. He
was allowed to eat food. The antibiotics and IVF were
discontinued. He will be discharged with hospice care to
[**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 1188**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]. He will likely not eat much and sleep multiple
times per day.

Hypotension: The patient was admitted with an elevated lactate
and hypotension. He received 2L of crystalloid in the ED. The
etiology of the hypotension and lactate is most likely
hypovolemia based on clinical signs. There was no intial focus
of infection but was given vancomycin and zosyn empirically and
continued while on the floor. After fluid resusitation the
patient was hemodynamically stable and his lacate downtrended to
normal.

Hypernatremia: Patient had significant hypernatremia on
admission most likely representing severe hypovolemia. After
intial fluid resuscitation with crystalloid he was started on
D5W drip to slowly decrease his serum sodium. At the time of his
transfer his serum sodium had returned to a normal level.

Hyperglycemia: Patient admitted with hyperglycemia around 700.
No evidence of DKA. Patient was given insulin bolus and started
on insulin drip. He was continued until his serum glucose
improved to less than <200. After day one patient was
transitioned to sliding scale insulin. Patient was kept on D5W
for fluids and glucose as he was unable to tolerate any PO
intake secondary to mental status. On discharge the sliding
scale was discontinued and glargine 15u qhs maintained for
comfort.

Altered mental status: Patient has history of vascular dementia
and is aggressive at baseline. Upon admission to the ICU patient
was responsive o
