History of Present Illness:
59 year old male with h/o Type I DM c/b b/l BKA (left [**2113**] and
right [**2118**]), neuropathy, retinopathy and nephropathy, HTN, COPD
who was admitted to medical floor with cellulitis of b/l stumps.
.
The patient was recently admitted on [**2036-3-20**] for dyspnea
secondary to PNA vs COP treated with levoflox x 10days. He was
also found to have a Enterococcal UTI, for which he was started
on Ampicillin x7 days. The patient left AMA with PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 702**].
The prior admission between [**Date range (1) **] started with a MICU stay
for hypoxia, hypercarbia and resultant lethargy. BiPap was used
intermittently with improvement in mental status and ventilation
.
After leaving AMA during most recent hospitalization, Patient
reports completing course of levofloxacin and ampicillin for
CAP/UTI.  Pt notes increasing redness and pain over past week in
both stumps.  He denied associated fevers/chills, dyspnea, or
chest pain.
.
Upon presentation to the ED, he was given Vanco and Unasyn, was
intermittently hypoxic with O2 sats 85% while sleeping and was
placed on 2L NC and admitted to floor. He was being treated on
broad spectrum abx for cellulitis in the setting of poorly
controlled Type I DM: vanc/zosyn/clinda, vascular surgery was
following.  CXR showed improvement of left basilar atelectasis
without focal consolidation.
.
He triggered yesterday for no UOP -> 700ml after foley catheter
insertion. Also with relative hypotension SBP 90s (b/l 130s)
with improvement of SBP 110s after 1L bolus NS yesterday. Was
noted to be intermittently lethargic during day, ABG obtained
was 7.32/57/68. He underwent a CT scan pelvis/extremities eval
for possible fasciitis, and was noted to be more somnolent
(arousable only to sternal rub). Repeat gas unchanged at
yesterday at 9pm: 7.32/58/69.  Patient was on unchanged
methadone maintenance without any additional prn pain
medications, and patient has not been able to be setup with
BIPAP at home, has documented OSA and received sleep eval during
recent hospitalization. Currently on 2-3L in low 90s. Unable to
initiate emergent BIPAP on floor so he was transferred to the
unit overnight to receive BiPAP.  He also received Narcan in the
unit, which improved his lethargy.
.
ABG following BiPAP this morning was 7.31/56/73.
.
Currently, the patient notes improved pain control in his
stumps.  (-)n/v/d/f/c.  has not had BM since admission, denies
constipation.  On ROS, does endorse orthonpea, no PND.  (-) abd

Reports:
ECG:  Artifact is present. Sinus rhythm. Atrial ectopy. Left
axis deviation. Left anterior fascicular block. Non-specific
ST-T wave changes. Compared to the previous tracing the Q-T
interval is shorter and ST-T wave changes are more prominent

LENIs:  No evidence of deep vein thrombosis in either leg

Chest PA and lateral:
In comparison with the study of [**3-24**], there is some decrease in
the  atelectatic change at the left base. The cardiac silhouette
remains at the upper limits of normal without vascular
congestion or pleural effusion.   Mediastinal and hilar contours
are normal.

CT pelvis/LEs:  IMPRESSION: Findings consistent with right
greater than left lower extremity cellulitis. No focal fluid
collection or subcutaneous gas to suggest Four
