Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 20400**] is a 50 yo [**Male First Name (un) 4746**] with PMH cryptogenic organizing
pneumonia diagnosed via RML wedge resection with pathologic
evidence - on chronic prednisone, diastolic CHF, DM, severe OSA,
obesity-hypoventilation, HTN, alcohol abuse, who presented with
2 week history of progressively worsening DOE. SOB improved with
diuresis.

#. Hypoxia: Dyspnea is likely multifactorial in etiology. h/o
COP s/p RML resection on chronic steroids. Worsening shortness
of breath, lower extremity swelling, orthopnea consistent with
acute on chronic heart failure exacerbation. PE was considered -
however onset of shortness of breath has been chronic and LENIs
were negative. Pneumonia was considered given patient's initial
presentation with hypotension, however patient was afebrile
without leukocytosis - patient did recieve Va
