[**2105-9-30**] ECHO:
Conclusions:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or
color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size
are normal.
There is moderate regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is moderately depressed. Resting
regional wall
motion abnormalities include mid to apical anteroseptal
akinesis/hypokinesis
and anterior and anterolateral wall hypokinesis. Right
ventricular chamber
size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets
are moderately
thickened with trace aortic regurgitation. There is mild to
moderate aortic
valve stenosis (valve gradient low due to reduced stroke
volume). The mitral
valve leaflets are moderately thickened. Moderate to severe (3+)
mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is moderate mitral annular
calcification with a
mild left ventricular inflow gradient. There is mild pulmonary
artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

Impression:
Moderate regional systolic LV dysfunction c/w CAD
Moderate to severe mitral regurgitation.
Mild to moderate aortic stenosis.
Mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension

Compared with the prior study (tape reviewed) of [**2105-9-21**], a
slightly higher
aortic valve gradient is now measured (likely related to
slightly better
technical quality of Doppler spectral measurement in the current
study). Left
ventricular systolic function and mitral valve appear similar.
Tricuspid
systolic gradient is now slightly lower.

Cath [**10-23**]:FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Two vessel (LAD, LCX) coronary artery disease.
2. Patent SVG to LAd with normal flow.
3. Successful stenting of the mid LCX with a bare meta (heparin
coated)

CAth [**10-18**]:FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Two vessel coronary artery disease.
2. PCI of the SVG->LAD.

Brief Hospital Course:
This is an 84 y/o F w/ h/o HOCM, CRI, CAD s/p CABG in '[**81**] (SVG
to LAD) and PTCA x 6 who presented to OSH with accelerating
chest pain. Found to have NSTEMI, with a positive troponin of
0.12 and was admitted for cardiac cath.

On cardiac cath [**9-18**] she was found to have an ulcerated 80%
lesion in the proximal SV to LAD graft. She underwent succesful
PTCA/stenting of the proximal and mid SVG to LAD with 2 Zeta
stents. Limited resting hemodynamics showed elevated central
aortic pressures (200/65mmHg). LV gram was not performed due to
renal insufficiency.

The patient recieved IV hydration with bicarb prior to and
post-cath. In the holding area post-cath she became hypoxic
requiring non-rebreather with O2 sats still in the low 90's. She
was felt to be fluid overloaded and a CXR was consistent with
florid CHF. She was given 20 mg IV lasix,then lasix 100mg IV and
was started on Natrecor drip. She was then transferred to the
CCU for further management.

She continued to have SSCP rated from [**Date range (1) 92236**] after arriving
in CCU. SL NTG and Nitro paste were tried with minor relief.
Then the patient was started on Nitro drip + morphine with
relief. Of note, she has tolerated nitrates well despite her h/o
HOCM. Her cardiac enzymes were also elevated overnight post-cath
and this was felt to be possibly related to showering of
microemboli from her SVG into her microvasculature. She
subsequently had resolution of her CK's and chest pain resolved.
However, on return to the floor she had persistent chest pains
despite nitro drip, prompting re-look catheritization.

Re-look cath on [**9-23**] showed the LCX to have serial 70% lesions
at the mid-segment. The SVG-->LAD was patent (mild residual
stenosis at the proximal stent). The mid-LCX was successfully
stented with a bare meta (heparin coated) stent. Of note, the
patient required non-rebreather tx and was transferred to CCU
for management of her CHF. The patinet was diuresed on natrecore
and lasix in the unit and transferred back to the floor on [**9-25**].


On return to the floor she was found to be mildly SOB, without
chest pressure or palpitations. JVP was up at 10cm's and she had
crackles on exam to apices with decreased air movement at the
bases. She was given 200mg IV lasix for goal diuresis of -500cc.
She was continued on lasix prn for goal of even to -500cc/day.
Oxygen status improved and she was able to maintain 96%O2 on RA.


Set-up was made for diialysis on [**9-28**] with permcath placement.
On her second day of dialysis, treatment was terminated early
secondary to chest pain and SOB. NTG x 3 was given with
sub-total relief of symptoms. She had an increased O2
requirement to 4L O2, with increasing SOB overnight. She
desaturated to 88% on 6L NC and was started on a non-rebreather.
At this time, she was found to have elevated JVP, tachypnea and
rales up to the apex. EKG was performed and showed no evidence
of acute MI (in the setting of baseline LBBB). She was given
200mg IV lasix and 250mg IV diuril with minimal response. Nitro
drip was titrated up to 200mcgs and 4mg IV morphine was given to
alleviate chest pain. Foley catheter was placed with minimal
return (<10cc). Natrecor drip was started at 0.01mcg/kg/min. ABG
demonstrated 7.23/65/66 with bicarb of 21, c/w an acute
respiratory acidosis. BIPAP was placed for respiratory support
and she was again transferred to the CCU. Of note, she was found
to have evidence as well of a new LLL pneumonia by CXR ,with a
WBC of 15.6, and was started on Levaquin/Flagyl.

Hemodialysis after transfer to CCU removed 2.0kg, but was c/b
hypotensive episodes w/ SBP decreased to the 70's. Hypotension
resolved with 500 cc NS IVF support. Subsequent hemodialysis was
well tolerated with maintenance of her blood pressures. Of note,
she did have shoulder/chest pain  + throat itchiness on HD #
