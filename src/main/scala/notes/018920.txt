Attending:[**Doctor First Name 1402**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of Breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none


History of Present Illness:
66M with no known PMH, but suspected HTN and DM, who presents
with shortness of breath and increased LE edema. The patient has
not followed up with doctors, and is a somewhat difficult
historian, but essentially reports 2-3 weeks of increased
difficulty breathing, with LE edema and difficulty ambulating at
home with a fall this AM. He reports having to sleep sitting in
a chair for the past year and a half. Denies any chest pain at
rest or with exertion; no LH, palpitations, URI sx, F/C. Reports
an occasional cough, non-productive. Was seen in ED about a year
ago for a fall on the job, where he was noted to have elevated
sugars and hypertension, and was seen in follow up not at [**Hospital1 18**]
(uncertain where), and was told to start metformin although he
did not take it. Reports today that he woke from sleep and
"couldn't get a deep breath." Tried to walk around, but felt
unsteady and apparently fell, although he did not hit his head.
No LOC or presyncope

Past Medical History:
?Hyperglycemia, HTN. s/p injury from fall about 1 year ago--seen
in [**Hospital1 18**] ED.

Social History:
Retired appliance technician and mechanic, retired since injury
last year. Lives in [**Location 86**] with wife, son here as well. Smoked
1-2ppd over 30+ years, quit about 20 years ago. ETOH: about 3
pints of whisky a week, with heavier use in younger years (about
1.5 gallons a week). Denies cocaine or IVDU.

Family History:
No significant CAD, HTN, DM

Physical Exam:
per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]:
VS: T 97.5 BP 146/88 HR 107 RR 28 O2 95% 2LNC
Gen: Obese male, NAD. Slightly dyspneic.
HEENT: NCAT. Sclera anicteric. Dry MM.
Neck: Supple with JVD to ear. Thick neck.
CV: Irregularly irregular, normal S1, S2. P2 tap on palpation.
No m/r/g appreciated. No S3 or S4.
Chest: BS BL, diminished at bases. No appreciable crackles,
wheezes.
Abd: Distended. No HSM or tenderness. Abd aorta not enlarged by
palpation. No abdominial bruits.
Ext: Skin changes c/w venous stasis. 3+ pitting edema.
Skin: Acanthosis nigricans on neck. Venous stasis changes as
above.


Pertinent Results:
Admit EKG: Atypical flutter vs Afib at 122. Low voltage. NL
axis/intervals. QS in V1V2 concerning for prior anterior MI.
Nonspecific TW flattening in inferior-lateral leads. No prior
available for comparison.
.
Admit CXR: Cardiac size cannot be evaluated. Large bilateral
pleural effusions are present. Some upper zone redistribution is
seen. Appearances are most suggestive of cardiac failure.
Infiltrates in both lower lobes cannot be excluded.
IMPRESSION: Evidence of failure with bilateral effusions.

Radiology
[**6-11**]: Echo: The left atrium is mildly dilated. The right atrium
is moderately dilated. The estimated right atrial pressure is
16-20 mmHg. There is moderate symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with normal cavity size. Due to suboptimal technical
quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully
excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic function is low
normal (LVEF 50%). The right ventricular cavity is moderately
dilated with free wall hypokinesis. The ascending aorta is
mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is
moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. The main
pulmonary artery is dilated. There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Right ventricular cavity enlargement with free wall
hypokinesis, pulmonary artery dilation and moderate pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. This constellation of findings is
suggestive of a primary pulmonary process.  Prominent left
ventricular hypertrophy with low normal systolic function. In
the absence of a history of systemic hypertension, an
infiltrative process (e.g., amyloid) should be considered.
.
[**6-12**]: DVT scan: negative


Brief Hospital Course:
66M with likely PMH DM, HTN, and COPD, who p/w progressive LE
edema and shortness of breath in the setting of taking no
medications.  He was also found to be in atrial fibrillation.
Hospital course by problem:
.
#) CHF: diastolic dysfunction and predominantly right sided
heart failure.  The patient likely had untreated CHF and a
progressive decline.  The etiology was likely [**2-10**] 1) untreated
HTN leading to diastolic dysfunction, 2) OSA leading to right
heart failure, and 3) atrial fib leading to mild systolic
dysfunction.  We aggressively diuresed initially to IV lasix (pt
responds to 40 IV) with goal 2-3 L negative per day.  We
diuresed 11L with improvement in his O2 requirement to RA and
improvement in his leg edema.  He also initially was treated
with a nitro gtt but this was weaned off in the setting of
starting the ACEi, aldactone, lasix PO, and BB.  The patient had
an echo as above which supported these conclusions.  Upon
discharge, he was on RA and ambulating.  We also counseled him
on the importance of low Na diet and monitoring weight closely.
** discharge weight is 136 kilograms **
.
# Cards Ischemic: There was no evidence of ischemia which
prompted the above exacerbation.  EKG and echo as above.  We
started ASA, checked lipids, treated with BB.  He will need
close followup with PCP and NP as outpt for management.
.
# Cards Rhythm: patient presented in AFib with unknown
chronicity.  We treated with increasing doses of metoprolol for
rate control.  We also treated with heparin gtt and bridged with
coumadin for three days.  His INR remained subtherapeutic at
d/c.  He received coumadin 5mg qhs x3 doses.  Per [**Company 191**] anticoag
nurses, we discharged him on 7.5mg qhs x1 then back to 5mg qhs
thereafter.  He has an INR check scheduled for [**6-15**] at [**Company 191**].

-We recommend he followup with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 171**] for echo and
potential DCCV in [**1-10**] months if he is documented properly
anticoagulated for >1 month time.  We are concerned he will not
be a good candidate for longterm anticoagulation given poor med
compliance in the past.  TSH normal.
.
# DM: A1c was checked and pending.  We treated with ISS and
temporarily with glargine.  We held metformin on dispo given his
heart failure.  We started glyburide 5 daily with followup in
[**Last Name (un) **].  If he becomes hypoglycemic, please d/c glyburide.
.
# OSA: patient with witnessed desats and apneic episodes at
night.  Has thick neck.  We were unable to get BiPap trial in
house [**2-10**] patient refusal.  He will benefit from outpt sleep
study.  This was strongly conveyed to patient and wife.
.
# HTN: ACEI, aldactone, and BB as above, titrated up to current
doses
.
# Dysuria: U/A neg, resolved.  received one dose of cipro but
this was stopped.
.
# FEN: DM/Low Na/Cardiac diet. Lytes need to be checked later
this week then again several weeks later to ensure that K and
Creatinine are stable.
.
# Code: Full
.
# Contact/social: family very involved.  patient had not
received medical care in the past.  He will need frequent
followup and encouragement.  Without his wife present, he can
get somewhat agitated but redirected easily.
.
# Dispo: we strongly recommended rehab but the patient refused.
