Elderly frail appearing gentleman in no distress even during

JVD and pulsations noted above the level of the earlobe at 30
degress. Slight hepatojugular reflux noted.
Bibasilar loud end inspiratory crackeles, good air movement, no
wheezes, no labored breathing or accessory muscle use

abdomen. Chronic venous stasis changes and LLE has a
hyperkeratotic lesion mid shin.

alert and appropriate, moving all four extremities spontaneously


Pertinent Results:
CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2135-4-20**] 6:13 PM
IMPRESSION: Apparent interval enlargement of large left pleural
effusion.
Diffuse interstitial edema, likely cardiogenic in etiology.
Underlying
infiltrate, particularly in the left perihilar region cannot be
excluded.
Consider repeat radiography after appropriate diuresis. If
clinically
feasible, consider PA and lateral views for improved detection.


Brief Hospital Course:
[**Age over 90 **]-year-old man with h/o HTN, CHF (EF 25-30%), CHB/Afib (s/p
pacemaker, on Coumadin and Digoxin), AS s/p AVR in [**2130**], OA,
admitted to CCU with worsening fatigue/DOE, 20 lb weight gain
(180 in [**2-9**] --> now 196), worsening pedal edema, CXR with
pulmonary edema and worsening L pleural effusion, all consistent
with acute on chronic systolic heart failure and atrial
fibrillation with RVR.
.
#. Acute on chronic systolic heart failure: Unclear precipitant
but medication nonadherence seems likely per the pt's daughter
who says he may have missed a couple days of Lasix.  Patient was
therapeutically anticoagulated on admission making PE less
likely.  Infarct less likely given normal Trop and negative MB.
Unclear why patient is not on beta blocker at home.  Patient was
diuresed with IV lasix with improvement of his symptoms. He was
transitioned to PO lasix when euvolemic.  Patient was started on
low dose beta blocker, and continued on ACEi, digoxin, and lasix
on discharge.
.
#. AFib with RVR: On presentation, patient had heart rates
ranging 140-180's with wide complexes, irregular.  Felt to be
AFib with underlying IVCD.  He was started on amiodarone drip
with heart rate responding to 120s.  Patient was continued on
digoxin and warfarin anticoagulation.  EP was asked to
interrogate his pacer which revealed that he has been in A fib
for the last year but with increasing average ventricular rate
over the last 2 weeks.  Patient had EP ablation performed on
[**2135-4-22**].
.
# Hyperkeratotic lesion on leg: The dermatology service was
consulted given concern for squamous cell carcinoma. The lesion
was biopsied, biopsy results are consistent with stasis changes
and porokeratosis. He will follow up with dermatology as an
outpatient.
