History of Present Illness:
69yoF with metastatic NSC lung ca to lumbosacral spine p/w from

immediately prior to transfer and was started on a PPI gtt and
octreotide gtt. She had NG lavage at OSH which was reportedly
negative. Has never had EGD/[**Last Name (un) **] in past.

.
IMAGING:
CXR: NG tube tip is either in the distal stomach or proximal
duodenum.
There is residual contrast in the collecting system of the
visualized portion of the right kidney and there is also oral
contrast within the colon. The mediastinum is slightly
prominent, possibly due to supine technique. There is right
lower lobe infiltrate.
.
CTA:
1. No evidence of active bleeding in the small bowel.
Gastrointestinal
bleeding in the large bowel is unable to be assessed on this
examination
secondary to recent oral contrast administration from CT
examination performed at an outside hospital.
2. Diffuse osseous metastatic disease, some of which demonstrate
a soft
tissue component. Pathologic fracture involving the right medial
acetabulum. The largest metastatic lesions at L2, and the
posterior elements of L3 are at risk of pathologic fracture.
3. Calcified gallbladder wall likely an early porcelain
gallbladder.
4. Moderate simple right pleural effusion.
5. 7-mm left adrenal nodule likely myelipoma or adenoma.
6. Proctitis.

Colonoscopy ([**10-29**]):
Findings:
Flat Lesions - A single small angioectasia with stigmata of
recent bleeding was seen in the 60 cm. [**Hospital1 **]-CAP Electrocautery was
applied for hemostasis successfully.
Protruding Lesions - A single sessile 5 mm non-bleeding polyp of
benign appearance was found at ~18 cm. A single sessile 5 mm
non-bleeding polyp of benign appearance was found in the rectum.

Excavated Lesions - A few non-bleeding diverticula with small
openings were seen in the distal sigmoid colon. A single
non-bleeding diverticulum was seen in the cecum.
Impression:
Polyp at ~18 cm
Polyp in the rectum
Diverticulosis of the distal sigmoid colon
Diverticulum in the cecum
Angioectasia in the 60 cm (thermal therapy)
Otherwise normal colonoscopy to terminal ileum
Recommendations: Patient should have a repeat flex sig with
polpyectomies and visualization of the rectum as an outpatient.
Clips were not used for AVM given likelihood that patient will
need MRI for ongoing treatment and care of her lung malignancy.
.
CTA Chest ([**10-30**]):
IMPRESSION:
1. No pulmonary embolism.
2. Large right upper lobe mass with probable lymphangitic spread
and
mediastinal invasion and compression of the right upper lobe
pulmonary
arterial and obliteration of a right upper lobe bronchus.
Extensive
mediastinal, subcarinal, and contralateral hilar
lymphadenopathy. Extensive bony metastatic disease involving a
left anterior third rib, numerous vertebral bodies, and the
sternum.
3. Increased size of a large right pleural effusion. Small left
pleural
effusion with atelectasis. Possible early aspiration has
occurred in the left lower lobe with bronchial wall thickening
that appears similar to the CT study performed two days prior.
4. Incidental note of an aberrant right subclavian artery.
.
CXR ([**11-1**]):
IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**10-26**]:
Large right hydropneumothorax is new since [**10-26**], including
substantial volume of right pleural fluid. Interstitial edema
has developed in the left lung, probably due to redirection of
pulmonary perfusion. Focal opacity in the perihilar left upper
lung could be pneumonia or aspiration. Followup advised. Heart
size is normal. Relatively mild leftward mediastinal shift
suggests central adenopathy anchoring the mediastinum.
.
CXR ([**11-1**]):
IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to 7:01 p.m.:
Moderate-sized right hydropneumothorax is still substantial,
only mildly
smaller following the insertion of a small-bore catheter in the
right upper hemithorax. Interstitial edema persists
