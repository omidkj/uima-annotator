No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7651**]
Chief Complaint:
shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none


History of Present Illness:
74 y/o patient with a hx of hypertension, hyperlipidemia & CVA
[**2158**] (no deficits). He ran out of his medications 3 weeks ago
and he began to feel progressively short of breath. His
shortness of breath progressed to the point where he was only
able to sleep while sitting up as he would otherwise develop
severe orthopnea and PND. He also began to develop productive
cough, also about 3 weeks ago. He was diagnosed with pneumonia
one week ago and was given a prescription for levofloxacin which
he took every other day. He then developed epigastric pain along
with his shortness of breath and he went to [**Hospital3 417**]
Medical Center for further evaluation. He has also been using
cocaine intermittently, last used 1 week ago.
.
He was admitted to [**Hospital3 417**] Medical Center on Friday [**2-24**]
with NSTEMI, CHF and pneumonia and acute renal failure CR 4.4, K
3.3 (repleting with 20meq this AM). Leukocytosis to high 14s and
requiring non-rebreather. (Currently on azithromax 500mg and
rocephin at 1gm). He was treated with lasix, metolazone and
nitro and transferred to the CCU. His CHF was treated
aggressively over weekend with above medications but his CHF
persisted. His echo showed 3+ MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] 20-25%. He was also
maintained on Milrinone drip at -.25mcg/kg/min & Heparin drip at
1000units/hr PTT 63. His troponin was 4.05 yesterday and peaked
at 7.39 today. Previous to transfer to [**Hospital1 18**], he was given 325mg
ASA, 75mg Plavix, 50mg metoprolol. No chest pain, presently, no
respirator distress - sats mid 90s on 3L nc. His VSS on
transfer: BP 137/73, HR 83 SR, w/PVCs RBBB, sats 95% 3L nc.
.
On review of systems, he denies any prior history of deep venous
thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery,
myalgias, joint pains, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors. He denies exertional
buttock or calf pain. All of the other review of systems were
negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
palpitations, syncope or presyncope. He states his shortness of
breath is much improved but he still has orthopnea and is
requiring supplemental O2.

Studies:
TTE ([**2164-2-28**]):
The left atrium is elongated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
are normal. The left ventricular cavity is severely dilated.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed
(LVEF= 15-20 %) secondary to focal akinesis of the inferior and
posterior walls, and severe hypokinesis of the rest of the left
ventricle. Significant papillary muscle dysfunction is present.
The right ventricular free wall thickness is normal. Right
ventricular chamber size is normal. with depressed free wall
contractility. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Mild (1+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Moderate to severe
(3+) mitral regurgitation is seen (due to chamber dilatation and
papillary muscle dysfunction). The tricuspid valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could
not be determined. There is no pericardial effusion.

Stress Test ([**2164-3-1**]):
IMPRESSION: No symptoms or ischemic EKG changes with vasodilator

infusion.

Cardiac Perfusion Test ([**2164-3-1**]):
IMPRESSION: No reversible myocardial perfusion defect. Severe
left ventricular enlargement. Calculated LVEF = 19%.

Cardiac MR ([**2164-3-2**]):
Impression:
1. Mildly dilated left ventricular cavity size with severe
global hypokinesis and focal inferior wall thinning and
akinesis. The LVEF and effective forward LVEF were severely
depressed at 21% and 15%, respectively.
2. Normal right ventricular cavity size with mild global free
wall
hypokinesis. The RVEF was mildly reduced at 44%.
3. Normal coronary artery origins. Diffusely diseased RCA
shortly after the origin. Poor image quality precluded further
assessment of the LCA.
4. Severe mitral regurgitation. Mild aortic regurgitation.
Moderate pulmonic regurgitation. Mild tricuspid regurgitation.
5. The indexed diameters of the ascending and descending
thoracic aorta were normal and mildly increased, respectively.
The main pulmonary artery diameter index was normal.
6. A note is made of a tiny (<5mm) left renal cyst. There was
also moderate atherosclerosis of the descending thoracic aorta

Theses findings are suggestive of a cardiomyopathy with at least
some
contribution of CAD.

Brief Hospital Course:
ID:
Patient is a 74 yo male with hx of HTN, HLD, DMII, CHF admitted
to OSH 4 days ago with shortness of breath, abdominal pain and
cough and found to have NSTEMI, pneumonia and acute on chronic
CHF exacerbation after stopping all medications 3 weeks now
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] CCU for further management of his CHF.
.
# CAD:
Patient was admitted to OSH with epigastric pain. His work-up
revealed NSTEMI with peak troponin at 7.39 trending down to 2.31
at time of admission to [**Hospital1 18**]. He denied chest pain at
admission. He is not aware of a diagnosis of CAD and he stated
he had never had a catheterization but he had taken nitro for
chest pain in the past. Troponins stayed flat at [**Hospital1 18**]. Pt was
continued on ASA 325mg and Clopidogrel 75mg (loaded already at
OSH) and Atorvastatin 80mg daily. Pt continued on heparin
