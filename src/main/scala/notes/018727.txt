[**2158-1-29**] chest x-ray:
UPRIGHT AP PORTABLE CHEST: The heart size is probably normal
given the AP
technique. Bilateral patchy opacities with some nodular features
are more
pronounced in the lower lobes. The left upper lobe is relatively
clear. No
pleural effusion or pneumothorax is detected. The visualized
osseous
structures are unremarkable.

IMPRESSION: Bilateral pulmonary opacities suggesting pneumonia.
Superimposed
pulmonary nodules cannot be excluded. Follow-up examination
after treatment
is recommended to document resolution.

[**2158-1-29**] head CT:
FINDINGS: There is concordant prominence of the ventricles and
sulci,
consistent with generalized volume loss. Hypoattenuation in the
periventricular white matter most likely represents chronic
microvascular
infarction. No intracranial hemorrhage, abnormal extraaxial
fluid collection,
mass effect or midline shift is detected. The basal cisterns are
patent.
Dense atherosclerotic calcifications are noted in the internal
carotid
arteries. The visualized paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells
are clear.

IMPRESSION: No intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect.


Brief Hospital Course:
73 year-old man with bladder cancer, stomach cancer admitted now
with nonketotic hyperosmolar state (ketones in UA felt likely
secondary to starvation/ketosis-no anion gap on Chem 7 and no
acidosis on ABG), pneumonia, UTI.  Following issues addressed on
this admission:
(Patient admitted to ICU initially on [**1-29**] and transferred to
floor on [**1-30**].)

ICU course:

Concerning nonketotic hyperosmolar state:  Patient initially
given insulin drip in ER, IVF for glucose in 600's, possible
DKA.  Patient was not acidotic, did not have gap, but ketones on
UA, felt secondary to starvation ketosis. ON transfer to the
MICU, sugars trended down and ISS started, insulin drip d/ced.
IVF were continued-D51/2NS.  On morning of transfer to floor,
patient started on NPH dosing along with ISS. TID lytes were
followed and magnesium, potassium and phosphorus were repleted
PRN.   Patient never developed gap or acidosis.  Fingersticks
running high 100's to low 200's on transfer.

Concerning his pneumonia/UTI: Patient febrile with elevated
white count, infiltrates on chest x-ray and urine with
pansensitive Klebsiella.  Maintained on Levaquin.  [**1-31**] Blood
cultures from [**2158-1-29**] with pansensitive Klebsiella.  Feel that
Levaquin adequate coverage given likely CAP and rapid clinical
improvement, although did have chemo treatment as inpatient
weeks ago.

Concerning his MS change: Patient with waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] mental
status, sometimes disoriented.  Alert but lethargic on transfer.
 Attributed to hyperosmolar state and infection and possible
sundowning.  Negative head CT, negative metabolic/toxic work-up.
 LP not felt to be indicated at this time given other
explanations.
Continue treatment of hyperosmolar state and pneumonia/UTI.

Concerning UTI: Cover with Levaquin.  Urine culture pending.

Concerning anemia: Patient admitted with Crit of 27 (appears to
be baseline). Etiology thought to be related to hematuria
secondary to hematoma. Then had drop to 20. Felt most likely due
to hydration/dilution, but given history of CAD decision made to
transfuse 1 unit on [**1-30**] and then additional 2 Units on [**2158-2-2**].
No evidence of acute bleeding.

Bladder ca/stomach ca: Stable. Continue outpt management as per
JP VA.

Concerning hypertension:  Elevated here from 150's to 180's
initially.  Metoprolol titrated up to 50 TID. Additionally,
captopril 25 TID added with better control, however d/c'ed when
outpt meds known. Discharged on outpt dose of Metop Tartrate 50
mg daily.

Concerning ARF: Patient admitted with creatinine in 2's
(baseline 1.5-1.8).  Down to 1.4 with hydration. Likely
component of CRI secondary to hypertension/DM.  Would encourage
adequate po hydration.
