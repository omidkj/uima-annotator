History of Present Illness:
This is an 89 year-old woman who has been living at [**Hospital **] with her sister for the past month with  multiple medical
problems who presented on [**5-5**] with mental status change.  Pt
awoke at 7 am on the morning of admission "not feeling well" and
was noted to have a change in mental status.  At 8:40 am the
patient was noted to have a right facial droop in the setting of
hypotension.  Pt was evaluated by the stroke service who
determined that the reported deficits had resolved following
correction of her hypotension.  A CT of the head did not reveal
any infarcts or acute changes.
On arrival in ER, patient noted to be hypotensive to high 60's
and hypoxic to 80's on room air.  She was admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**]
with septic physiology of unknown source, but given history of
UTI's and few localizing symptoms, felt secondary to urosepsis.
Initially started on vanc/levo/flagyl in ED.  Dirty U/A.

Patient given 5 liters of normal saline in [**Hospital Unit Name 153**],
Zosyn/vancomycin maintained and patient's blood pressure
improved to systolics in 120's overnight.  Patient less hypoxic,
satting well on 4 liters.

Patient transferred to the floor on [**2178-5-6**].  At this time, her
mental status is improved and appears to be at baseline.  She
has dementia at baseline.  She denies localizing complaints
ongoing prior to admission or at this time.  Says she just felt
sleepy before coming in.  Denies cough, sputum production, chest
pain.  Denies dysuria, irritative symptoms.   Denies abdominal
pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea.  No recent change in bowel
habits.  Denies hematochezia, melena, hemoptysis, hematemesis.

[**5-5**] head CT:
FINDINGS: Study is being compared to prior examination from
[**2176-2-15**].
No significant changes are noted. Motion artifact is again
present, limiting
the evaluation. No intracranial masses, nor hemorrhages are
identified.
Midline structures are normal in position. Ventricles and
subarachnoid spaces
are within normal limits for age. Decreased attenuation is again
visualized
in the left posterior frontal white matter consistent with a
chronic
infarction. Patchy areas of low density is seen in the
periventricular and
deep white matter of both cerebral hemispheres, consistent with
chronic
microvascular ischemic changes. No acute major vascular
territorial
infarctions are identified.

INTERPRETATION: Chronic infarct in the posterior left frontal
lobe. Chronic
microvascular ischemic changes. MRI is more sensitive in
detecting acute
infarction.

[**5-5**] Chest x-ray:
INDICATION: Right facial droop. Question infiltrate.

Examination is limited due to kyphoscoliosis and flexed position
of the
patient's neck, partially obscuring the superior mediastinum and
lung apices.

There is a new patchy area of consolidation within the right
lower lobe as
well as an area of ill-defined opacity in the left perihilar
region. The
latter finding is best visualized on the second of two images in
this series.
Cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable with a hiatal hernia
noted,
although this was previously better visualized on prior studies.


IMPRESSION: Patchy right lower lobe and left perihilar
opacities, which may
be due to aspiration or pneumonia. Followup radiographs are
suggested to
document resolution.

[**5-6**] chest x-ray:
INDICATION: 89-year-old woman with pneumonia.

TECHNIQUE: Portable AP chest radiograph.

COMPARISON: Chest x-ray dated [**2178-5-5**].

FINDINGS: Note is made of marked kyphosis and tortuosity of
thoracic aorta
and trachea. The patient head is partially overlying the upper
lung fields.
Cardiac and mediastinal contours are overall unchanged compared
to the prior
study. Note is made of CHF. Note is made of increased bilateral
pleural
effusion with atelectasis versus consolidation. Healed fracture
of the right
humerus is noted.

IMPRESSION: Worsening CHF, bilateral pleural effusion and
bibasilar
consolidation versus atelectasis, which can represent worsening
pneumonia.
