History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 21 year old African-American male with no
significant past medical history who presented to the ED on
[**2142-4-28**] after being transferred from [**Hospital 1474**] Hospital. The
patient had presented to [**Hospital1 1474**] via his family on [**2142-4-27**] at
5:30 pm with the chief complaint of generalized body aches. He
complained of left knee pain after recently suffered an injury
to his left knee (scraped) while playing basketball for which he
was evaluated for at an OSH. He also complained of nausea,
vomiting, diarrhea, and headache.
.
At [**Hospital1 1474**], the patient was noted to have a temperature of 103,
P 122, BP 128/69. He was sat'ing 99% on RA. The patient was
found to have a left swollen knee and purpura fulminans. He was
given Ceftriaxone 2 gm IV (split dose), doxycycline 100 mg PO,
vancomycin 1 gm IV. He also received an estimated 3.5 liters.
.
The patient's ABG at [**Hospital1 1474**] at 12:40 am was as follows:
.
7.33/27/103/13.6
.
His Chem7 at [**Hospital1 1474**] was notable for a K of 3.2, gap of 15, Cr
2.4.
.
At [**Hospital1 1474**], the left knee was tapped. He was then transferred
to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation.
.
On arrival, the CXR concerning for ARDS with:
.
Diffuse faint opacity bilaterally with increased interstitial
markings, worrisome for atypical diffuse infection such as virus
or PCP.
.
His ABG at [**Hospital1 18**] was as follows:
.
7.11/47/116/16 with a lactate of 9.6 at 5:15 am on [**2142-4-28**].
.
He was subsequently intubated. His SBP dropped to the 80s and he
was thus started on levophed now at 0.458. Solumedrol and later
decadron were given. Central line with continuous Svo2 monitor
placed.
.
ROS: as per HPI, unable to get further info as pt int/sed

Past Surgical History:
None


Social History:
The patient works at [**Company 2486**]. He is married but separated

.
CXR [**2142-4-28**] - The heart is normal in size. The mediastinal
contours are within normal limits. Note is made of increased
interstitial markings bilaterally, worrisome for atypical
infection such as virus or PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) 67451**] arch is somewhat
prominent.
.
CT HEAD [**2142-4-28**] - No evidence of hemorrhage, shift of normally
midline structures, or hydrocephalus. [**Doctor Last Name **]-white differentiation
appears grossly preserved. Air- fluid levels are noted within
the frontal, maxillary and sphenoid sinuses. There is also
opacification of the ethmoid airspaces.
.
MRI HEAD/CSPINE ([**2142-5-12**])- No evidence of intracranial
enhancement, mass effect, or hydrocephalus. No focal signal
abnormalities or acute infarcts. Extensive soft tissue changes
in the mastoid air cells and the paranasal sinuses could be
related to intubation.  No evidence of epidural abscess or
hematoma. No spinal cord compression seen. Clinical correlation
recommended.
.
CT TORSO ([**2142-5-13**]) -
CT OF THE CHEST WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: The endotracheal tube is
above the level of the carina. The NG tube is in satisfactory
position. There are multiple sub 5-mm pulmonary nodules
diffusely throughout the lung fields. There are small bilateral
pleural effusions as well as bibasilar atelectasis. There is
diffuse anasarca. There is evidence of pulmonary edema. There
are no visualized lymph nodes meeting CT criteria for pathology
on this unenhanced scan. The pleural effusions measures simple
fluid in Hounsfield units.
.
CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: On this unenhanced scan,
the liver, adrenal glands, gallbladder, spleen, pancreas,
kidneys, and ureters are normal. The small bowel is normal. The
large bowel is distended and fluid- filled, and featureless.
Again there is diffuse anasarca. There is no visualized
lymphadenopathy or free fluid, given the limitations of this
unenhanced scan. The aorta is of normal caliber. There is no
evidence of retroperitoneal hematoma.
.
CT OF THE PELVIS WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: The rectum is fluid-filled
and
distended. The bladder contains a Foley catheter. There is
diffuse anasarca. No free fluid. No inguinal lymphadenopathy.
.
PORTABLE CHEST OF [**2142-5-29**]
Tracheostomy tube and right PICC line remain in standard
position. Cardiac silhouette appears prominent but stable in
size. Pulmonary vascularity is within normal limits. Previously
reported basilar areas of consolidation are no longer evident.
There are no new areas of consolidation, but the extreme
periphery of the right lung base laterally has been excluded,
precluding assessment of this region.
.
ECHOCARDIOGRAM [**2142-5-25**]:
The left atrium is dilated. No atrial septal defect is seen by
2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are
normal. The left ventricular
cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is normal
(LVEF 70%). No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
There is no ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber
size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and
no aortic regurgitation. No masses or vegetations are seen on
the aortic valve. The mitral valve appears structurally normal
with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve. The
estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. No
vegetation/mass is seen on the pulmonic valve. There is no
pericardial effu
