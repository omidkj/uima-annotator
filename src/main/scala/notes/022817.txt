Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2704**]
Chief Complaint:
Transferred from outside hospital for coronary and carotid cath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
carotid cath
coronary cath


History of Present Illness:
64 yr old hypertensive, diabetic male with CAD s/p CABG '[**93**] and
b/l carotid disease transferred from OSH after an episode of
chest pain and aphasia.   He was in his USOH until [**2101-1-27**] when
at noon he developed substernal chest "burning" while sitting at
his office.  He noticed that his speech was slurred and "the
words wouldn't come out." When his wife called him she noted
that his words "made no sense" "he was saying nonsense."  She
thought he might have been hypoglycemia and gave him some coke,
after which his symptoms improved.  They called EMS and were
taken to [**Hospital **] Hospital.  A Head CT was   (-) for bleed and
Trop-I+ 0.87. Ck 200.  He received 2 doses of 1 mg/kg lovenox
and was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].

He had LAD stent in [**Hospital1 18**]. A few days later, he has RCA stented
and has myoclonic jerk, NOT seizure in the cath lab per
neurology attending

[**2101-1-27**]: Chronic Right Occipital Cortical Infarct, chronic deep

cath [**2-2**]:
1. Significant native coronary artery disease.
2. Severe bilateral internal carotid artery disease.
3. Arterial disease in the left subclavian and bilateral
vertebrals
4. Successful placement of self-expanding stent in left ICA.
5. Successful employment of AccuNet distal embolic protection.
6. Self-limited, brief myotoclonus event.
COMMENTS:
1. Limited coronary angiography demonstrated a right dominant
system
with left main and severe native vessel disease. The LMCA had an
ostial
60% lesion. The proximal and midvessel LAD had diffuse calcific
disease.
The distal LAD filled via a LIMA which was not selectively
engaged. The
D1 branch was totally occluded. The LCx had mild diffuse
disease. The
RCA and bypass grafts were not successfully engaged.
2. Limited resting hemodynamics revealed a central blood
pressure of
132/57 mmHg and a left CFA pressure of 101/67 mmHg. The mean
gradient
was 3 mmHg.
3. Retrograde access of the left common femoral artery was
obtained for
selective carotid, vertebral, and coronary angiography. The
thoracic
aorta had a Type I arch. The bilateral subclavian arteries had
mild
proximal disease. The left subclavian artery had a 50% lesion in
the
origin with a peak to peak gradient of 20 mmHg.
4. The right vertebral artery was small and diminutive with a
total
occlusion at the base of the skull before entering the brain.
The left
vertebral artery was large and was noted to have a 60% origin
lesion and
filled the basilar and the cerebellar arteries. The
contralateral PCA
filled from the vertebral but the ipsilateral (left) PCA was not
seen.
5. The right common carotid artery was without disease but the
ICA was
totally occluded. The left common carotid artery was without
disease but
the ICA had diffuse tubular 80% disease. The left ICA filled the
ipsilateral ACA and MCA as well as the contralateral ACA and MCA
via a
large ACOM.
6. Successful placement of a [**5-4**] x 40 mm Acculink stent in the
left ICA
postdilated with a 4.5 mm balloon. Final angiography
demonstrated no
residual stenosis, no angiographically apparent dissection, and
normal
flow (See PTCA Comments).
7. Transient, self-limited myoclonic event during postdilation
which was
though not likely to represent seizure activity.
8. Successful Perclose of the left femoral arteriotomy site at
the
conclusion of the procedure without complications.

Cath at OSH [**8-30**]: "multiple tight stenoses of the proximal LAD
and proximal D1. Proximal D2 occluded. RCA proximally occluded.
LIMA to LAD patent, svg to diag could not be visualized and was
presumed occluded. Left carotid patent, right carotid occluded."


cardiac cath [**2101-1-31**]
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Rotation atheterectomy of the proximal LAD.
3. Unsuccessful attempt at PTCA/stenting of the D1.
COMMENTS: 1. Selective coronary angiography revealed a right
dominant system. The RCA was not injected. The SVgs and the LIMA
were
not injected. The LMCA had a 60% ostial stenosis. The proximal
LAD [**Last Name (un) **]
80% calcific stenosis. The distal LAD was filling via a LIMA
(there was
competitive flow). The D1 had a 80% calcific stenosis at the
origin. The
LCX had mild diffuise disease.
2. Unsuccessful attempt at PTCA/stenting of the D1 due to
inability to
cross despite using multiple wires. Rotational atherectomy was
performed
in the LAD in an attempt to modify the LAD lesion and allow
crossing
inro the D1 (See PTCA comments).

carotid series [**2101-1-31**]:
REASON: Known carotid atherosclerosis, pre-op for stenting.

FINDINGS: Duplex evaluation was performed of both carotid
arteries.
Significant plaque was identified on the right. There is no flow
in internal
carotid artery including power Doppler technique. Of note there
is no study
for comparison.

On the left, significant mostly soft appearing homogeneous
plaque is
identified in the internal carotid artery. Of note it appears to
extend
fairly distally in the cervical internal carotid artery.

On the right, peak systolic velocities are 52, 72 in the CCA,
ECA
respectively.

On the left, in the internal carotid artery the peak systolic
over diastolic
velocity is 361/123. In the remainder of the vessel the peak
systolic
velocities are 54, 584 in the CCA, ECA respectively. The ICA-CCA
ratio is 6.
This is consistent with an 80-99% stenosis.
