Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1936**]
Chief Complaint:
Alcohol withdrawal

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 60 year old male with past medical history of
alcohol abuse. He was transferred from the [**Hospital 882**] Hospital
this evening after presenting there for alcohol and valium
withdrawal. He was brought in by his sister who was concerned
regarding his shakiness. He is unable to provide a consistent
story, so much is gathered from the chart. He reports his last
drink was this morning, though told the ED staff it was last
week. Per the [**Hospital1 882**] transfer note, patient was binge drinking
for the last several weeks. Patient admits to drinking at least
20 beers at a time.
.
He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] due to persistent tachycardia and
hallucinations, after he was placed on an ativan drip at 4 mg
per hour after receiving 6 mg of ativan and a banana bag.
.
In the emergency room at [**Hospital1 18**], his initial vital signs were
heart rate of 115, blood pressure of 139/44, respiratory rate
21, oxygenation of 98% on 4L, and temperature of 97.9. He was
continued on the ativan drip at 4mg/hour. He received 40 mg of
valium over the first hour, and then an additional 20 mg. He
remained tachycardic in the 110's, and received a total of 2
liters of IVF after his banana bag.
.
Upon arrival to the ICU, patient would answer questions
appropriately, although appeared slightly tired. His speech was
not slurred. He was asking about smoking a cigarette. He
reported that his PCP gives him 50 valium 2-3 times a year, and
he takes them sparingly for withdrawal symptoms. He reports he
has only taken a few over the last days.

Social History:
Per notes from [**Hospital 882**] Hospital, patient lives in [**Location (un) 8973**]

Imaging/results:

CT chest [**4-5**]; IMPRESSION:
1. No correlate is identified for what was described as a
granuloma on the recent radiograph; however, there is a focus of
linear nodular soft tissue thickening at the left lung base.
Differntials include infection,scarring and neoplasm. This area
needs to be followed up after antibiotic therapy in three
months.
2. Multiple pathologically enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes.
Attention to this area in followup imaging is recommended.
3. Paraseptal emphysematous changes of the lung apeces.
4. Ground-glass densities distributed through the lingula and
lower lobes. Attention to these areas after antibiotic therapy
is recommended.
5. Subpleural and basilar ground-glass opacities are most likely
related to atelectasis or infection.
6. Severe calcification of mitral valve.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr [**Known lastname **] is a 60 year old male with h/o ETOH abuse who presented
from an outside hospital for alcohol and benzodiazepene abuse
and withdrawal.
.
Hospital course by problem:
.
Alcohol, benzo withdrawal, Delirium Tremens: On transfer from
the OSH, the patient's story was not entirely clear, as there
were varying reports of when his last drink was. According to
pts daughter, his last drink was the morning prior to his
admission as her aunt (pts sister) had brought beer to him that
morning to help with the withdrawl. He does state that he drinks
as many as 20 beers at a time. However his toxicology screens
were negative at the OSH for alcohol. It is also unclear how
much valium he has been taking, but his toxicology screens
suggested that he has been taking this. Of note, the pts PCP
prescribes the pt valium in case he has withdrawl, and sister
thinks he may have taken 12pills day prior to admission.  His
tox screen was also positive for amphetamines, which the pt did
not endorse taking. He received 6 mg of ativan and then ativan
gtt at 4 mg/hr at OSH prior to transfer here. He then received
Valium 10 mg IV x6 in our ED on admission. In the ICU he
received 10 mg more of valium overnight and was then transferred
to the floor for further management. He was continued on a CIWA
scale, thiamine, and folic acid. Initially he was requiring 50
mg of valium a day per q4 hr CIWA scale, but on hospital day 3
(4 days after pts last drink), pt triggered  for HR of 140, temp
of 103.8, visual hallucinations, and tremors. He was given
Valium 10 mg IV x 6 over 2 hours with HR decreasing to 110 and
temp coming down to 101. CIWA scale was increased from q4 to q 2
hr. On hospital day 4 pt required much less valium, T max was
100.7, and HR decreased to 90s-100s. Over then next several
days, his symptoms continued to improve though he continued to
manifest signs of mild delirium. Psych was consulted to help
with disposition as pt and family were interested in treatment
program/stabilization unit, who initially did not feel patient
was medically cleared from delirium to go to a treatment
program. On reevaluation [**4-12**] when pt was otherwise doing quite
well, psych agreed that he continued to improve and there was
hope that he would continue to improve over next few days. They
felt he was cleared (and he was cleared by PT/OT) to participate
in treatment program.   Given the patient's and family
preference for a stabilization unit discharge, social work had
been working hard on this and pt was able to go to [**Location (un) 3244**]
stabilization on discharge.
Of note, psych also felt that given his history and prior unsafe
behaviours (see below), he very well may have underlying
cognitive deficits and reccommneded outpt neuropsych testing in
a few weeks after delirium has time to clear up.
Of note, was Rx for PNA (CAP vs aspiration) with levo/flagyl
X7days. CT showed lymphadenopathy and LLL nodule and given his
significant smoking history, he needs a f/u CT in 3mos (per PCP
office, no abnormal findings on CT done [**2112**]).
Was completely off valium for several days after discharge. He
was resumed on lexapro (on this in past) on discharge for his
generalized anxiety (no clear depression). It is to note that he
does consume a lot of caffiene (several cups of coffee in
morning) which caused him to be anxious, and is instructed to
limit himself to only 1 cup every 4-6hours!!!!

Social: Per pts daughter, pt burned his apartment down in [**10-25**]
with a lit cigarette while intoxicated. He also fell and
fractured his hip while intoxicated, and was hospitalized for
this. He was then discharged to rehab and went back home, with
no formal safety/social work evaluation prior to going back
home. Of concern, was that the pt had been sitting in a chair
for a week drinking continuously prior to his admission here. He
was noted to have sacral wounds and decubitus ulcers from
prolonged sitting. He also did not leave his apartment in the
