History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 4541**] is a 70 year old male who presented to another
institution with right sided chest pain and ruled in for NSTEMI
with a troponin of 1.0.  He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for
catheterization.

He reported right sided, parasternal pain  intermittently for 2
weeks. No pain prior to this. This was descibed as  squeezing
and  dull, lasting 10-15 minutes, both at rest and with
exertion, but mostly in exertion. It radiated to the right
shoulder and down to his arm. On [**3-27**] after a large meal, he had
a recurrence, with nausea and diaphoresis. He was taken to the
ED at [**Location (un) **] where he had Sinus bradycardia, AV block (old),
TwI V1, V2 biphasic Tw, I Twf, aVL TwI. He was free of angina
upon arrival to ED. He ruled in based on a Troponin of 1.05. he
was loaded with Plavix 300mg, given ASA, beta blocker, and a
Heparin infusion was begun. Heparin infusion was discontinued at
transfer.

Pertinent Results:
[**2145-3-29**] Echocardiogram: The left atrium is dilated. Left
ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There
is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with mild
hypokinesis of the mid to distal anterior wall, anterior septum
and apex and moderate hypokinesis of the anterolateral wall..
Diastolic function could not be assessed. There is no
ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and
free wall motion are normal. The aortic root is moderately
dilated at the sinus level. The ascending aorta is mildly
dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but
aortic stenosis is not present. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
.
[**2145-3-30**] Carotid Ultrasound:
Right ICA stenosis <40%. Left ICA stenosis <40%.
.
[**2145-3-30**] Chest CT Scan:
No pneumonia, no lung masses, no pleural effusions.
Calcifications of the coronary arteries, the aorta and the
supraaortic branches. Slightly increased number of mediastinal
lymph nodes, but no mediastinal lymphadenopathy. Large hepatic
cyst.
.
[**2145-4-1**] Intraop TEE:
PRE BYPASS The left atrium is markedly dilated. The left atrium
is elongated. No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen
in the body of the left atrium or left atrial appendage. No
atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. There is mild global left
ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 40-45 %). In addition, the
anterior, anterolateral, anteroseptal and apical walls have
slightly more hypokinesis then the rest of the other myocardial
segments. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. There are
simple atheroma in the aortic arch. There are complex (mobile)
atheroma in the descending aorta. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Physiologic mitral regurgitation is seen
(within normal limits). Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 914**] was notified in person of
the results in the operating room at the time of the study.

POST BYPASS The patient is being AV paced. There is normal right
ventricular systolic function. The left ventricle displays
slightly improved global function with continued mild
hypokinesis of the anterior, anteroseptal, anterolateral, and
apical segments. Overall ejection fraction is about 45%. The
mitral regurgitation is slightly worse, now mild. The thoracic
aorta appears intact.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 4541**] was admitted to cardiology with a non ST elevation
myocardial infarction. He remained pain free on intravenous
Heparin and medical therapy. The following day, he underwent
cardiac catheterization which revealed severe three vessel
coronary artery disease.  Based upon the findings, cardiac
surgery was consulted and further preoperative evaluation was
performed. In anticipation of surgery, Plavix was discontinued.
Carotid ultrasound found only minimal disease of the internal
carotid arteries. To further evaluate his ascending aorta, chest
CT scan was obtained which showed that the ascending aorta had a
maximal diameter of only four centimeters. The remainder of his
preoperative course was uneventful. He remained pain free and
was eventually cleared for surgery.

On [**4-1**], Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 914**] performed coronary artery bypass
grafting surgery. For surgical details, please see operative
note. Given his inpatient stay was greater than 24 hours prior
to surgery, he was given Vancomycin for perioperative antibiotic
coverage. Following surgery, he was brought to the CVICU for
invasive monitoring. Within 24 hours, he awoke neurologically
intact and was extubated without incident.  The patient was
transferred to the telemetry floor on POD 1.  Chest tubes and
pacing wires were discontinued without incident according to
protocol.  The physical therapy service was consulted for
assistance with post-operative strength and mobility.

He did have multifocal atrial tachycardia for which EP was
consulted. Low dose beta blockers were recommended and begun.
He remained stable and was ready for discharge.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] will
follow him after discharge for cardiology and is aware of the
dyrhythmia.

Discharge medications, restrictions and followup were discussed
with the patient prior to going home.
