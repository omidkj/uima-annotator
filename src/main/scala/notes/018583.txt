Findings
LEFT ATRIUM: Mild LA enlargement.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: A catheter or pacing wire is
seen in the RA and extending into the RV. No ASD by 2D or color
Doppler.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thickness and cavity size. Normal
regional LV systolic function. Overall normal LVEF (>55%).

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTA: Normal ascending aorta diameter. Normal aortic arch
diameter. Simple atheroma in aortic arch. Normal descending
aorta diameter. Simple atheroma in descending aorta.

AORTIC VALVE: Normal aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS. Mild (1+)
AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. Moderate
mitral annular calcification. Torn mitral chordae. No MS.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed

regulations. The patient was under general anesthesia throughout
the procedure. No TEE related complications. Houseofficer caring
for the patient was notified of the results by e-mail.
Conclusions
PREBYPASS

1. The left atrium is normal in size. Left atrial appendage PWD
velocities were > 20 cm/sec

2. No atrial septal defect or PFO is seen by 2D or color
Doppler.

3. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF 65%).

4. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal.

5. There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch. There are
simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.

6. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with
good leaflet excursion. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.

7. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened with a
significant thickening along the tip of the anterior leaflet
between A2 and A3. A small torn mitral chordae may be present in
the right atria. Predominantly moderate or at worst
Intermittently moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is
seen with a >=0.7cm withan eccentric, posteriorly directed jet.
Mitral valve area is 2.5 cm2, with a mitral annular diameter of
3.4 cm.

8. There is no pericardial effusion.

9. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 914**] told of all results during the surgery.

POSTBYPASS
1. Patient is on phenlyephrine and low dose epinephrine

2. The left ventricular function remains similar to prebypass

3. The mitral valve had [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) 84256**] stitch placed. Post bypass
MVA measured 3.4 cm2 with a mitral annular diameter of 2.3 cm.
The vena contracta was 0.7 cm. The MR jet is directed along the
posterior wall.

4. The aortic wall is smooth after decannulation.

5. There is no left atrial appendage seen s/p ligation.

6. All findings discussed with surgeons at the time of the exam.

  I certify that I was present for this procedure in compliance
with HCFA regulations.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 92892**] was admitted pre-operatively for heparin given her
history of atrial fibrillation.  On [**2123-12-30**] she underwent a
coronary artery bypass graft, mitral valve replacement, and MAZE
procedure with left atrial ligation.  This procedure was
performed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 914**].  The patient tolerated the procedure
well and was transferred in cri
