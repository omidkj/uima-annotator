Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2962**]
Chief Complaint:
Transferred from [**Hospital 1474**] Hospital after syncope in the setting
of atrial fibrillation, bradycardia, s/p v fib arrest treated w/
DCCV.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
cardiac catheterization
electrophysiology study
permanent pacemaker placement


History of Present Illness:
77-yo-woman w/ MMP including atrial fib and valvular heart
disease initially had unwitnessed syncope this AM while
toileting. Before using the bathroom, she had been feeling
nauseated and fatigued. Awoke on the toilet after LOC of
uncertain duration and called EMS, who arrived to find the pt
nauseated, dizzy, and mildly dyspneic, w/ HR 30 and BP 140/80.
EMS treated w/ atropine 0.5 mg IV x 2, resulting in HR increased
to atrial fib in the 70s, BP increased to 160/100. She was then
transported to [**Hospital 1474**] Hospital ED.
.
At [**Hospital 1474**] Hospital ED, her HR was again in the 40s w/ BP
210/90, and she was reportedly mentating well. Fifteen minutes
later, she was found to be unresponsive w/ telemetry interpreted
as ventricular fib. No documentation regarding pt's BP or pulse
status at that time, but CPR was started, pt was intubated, and
amiodarone 150 mg IV given as bolus dose. After "a few seconds"
the rhythm converted to ventricular tach and then to atrial fib
w/ PVCs. She was then admitted to the CCU.
.
In the [**Hospital1 1474**] CCU, she was extubated easily. Amiodarone gtt
was started, but stopped soon after because HR decreased to 30s.
Pt was transfused 2 units FFP in prep for placement of
transvenous pacing wire. Before the procedure, she had episode
of v tach --> v fib treated w/ DCCV at 200 joules, resulting in
return to atrial fib. The pacing wire was then placed through
right femoral vein. After the pacer demonstrated appropriate
capture and paced rhythm at 70 bpm, amiodarone gtt was resumed
at 1 mg/hr. She is now transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] CCU for further
care.
.
Currently, she c/o mild right sided chest pain w/ no cough,
dyspnea, palpitations. ROS reveals increasing DOE over past 2
months requiring wheelchair for excursions outside the home;
otherwise unreliable given acute delirium.

Radiology:
[**7-14**] Carotids: Minimal plaque with bilateral less than 40%
carotid stenosis.
.
[**7-14**] Echo: There is moderate to severe regional left ventricular
systolic dysfunction with mid to distal septal akinesis and
apical dyskinesis/akinesis.. There is focal hypokinesis of the
apical free wall of the right ventricle. Moderate (2+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is
seen. There is moderateto severe pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. Significant pulmonic regurgitation is seen. There
is a small pericardial effusion. There are no echocardiographic
signs of tamponade.
.
[**7-15**]: Cardiac cath:
1. Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system
revealed
no obstructive CAD. The LMCA, LCX and LAD had no
angiographically
apparent flow limiting stenoses. There was a fistula from the
LAD to the
LV. The RCA was a dominant vessel with a large embolus in the
distal
vessel. there was a small embolus in the AV nodal branch.
2. Limited resting hemodynamics revealed systemic hypertension.
3. Left ventriculography was deferred.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. No obstructive coronary artery disease.
2. Embolus in distal RCA and AV nodal branch.
.
[**7-16**] Echo: The left ventricular cavity size is normal. LV
systolic function appears depressed. There is mid septal
akinesis/hypokinesis and apical septal hypokinesis. Right
ventricular chamber size is normal. There is focal hypokinesis
of the apical free wall of the right ventricle. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. Mild to moderate ([**2-4**]+)
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is at least mild-moderate mitral
regurgitation (not fully assessed). The tricuspid valve leaflets
are mildly thickened. Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid
regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is a small pericardial effusion.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2194-7-14**],
left ventricular systolic function appears improved.
.
[**7-17**]: RUQ ultrasound: 1. No biliary dilatation.
2. Distention of the central right renal collecting system,
likely indicating a UPJ obstruction. CT may be performed for
further evaluation if clinically indicated. Ultrasound cannot
exclude pyelonephritis.
.
[**7-17**]: CT Abd:
1. Moderate-sized right pleural effusion and adjacent airspace
disease which may represent compressive atelectasis, however,
infection cannot be excluded.
2. Extrarenal pelvis on the right. No evidence of obstruction.
3. Left posterolateral hernia containing retroperitoneal fat, of
uncertain cause given the lack of evidence of surgery in that
region.
4. Partial right colectomy with post-surgical changes.
5. Sigmoid diverticulosis without evidence of diverticulitis.
6. Presacral edema, which may be related to fluid overload given
the presence of diffuse subcutaneous edema.
.
[**7-17**]: CXR: mild cardiac failure and right pleural effusion with
associated atelectasis
.
[**7-22**]: CT Chest:
1. Moderate right pleural effusion with associated compressive
atelectasis.
2. Ill-defined patchy opacity with air bronchograms in the
superior posterior aspect of the left lower lobe. It would be
helpful to compare with old studies to assess for interval
change. In this patient post-ca
