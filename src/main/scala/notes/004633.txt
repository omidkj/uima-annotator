Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1515**]
Chief Complaint:
Acute onset shortness of breath.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Left medial malleolus debridement and bone biopsy.


History of Present Illness:
A 45 year-old woman with past medical history of diabetes,
dyslipidemia, hypertension, coronary disease s/p CABG in [**5-1**]
(LIMA-LAD, SVG-PDA, OMI-Diag) with known occlusion of 2 SVGs
with patent SVG to RCA and LIMA to LAD, diastolic CHF (EF
50-55%), ESRD s/p kidney transplant, who presents today with
acute onset shortness of breath.

Patient says the symptoms started on the morning of admission
with acute onset SOB that woke her from sleep. There was
associated chest tightness. Both symptoms improved markedly once
she sat up, but she continued to experience mild shortness of
breath so she called 911.

She was initially evaluated at [**Hospital6 33**] where she
was placed on a nitro drip (CP resolved) and BiPAP. She was
given 80 mg IV Lasix with unclear amount of urine output.
Cardiac enzymes were negative. She was then transferred to [**Hospital1 **]
for further care. Her vitals at time of transfer were T 98, BP
125/26, RR 32, sat 100% on BiPAP. In the ED she was noted to
have bibasilar crackles on exam. An EKG showed no ischemic
changes and CXR showed no clear infiltrate (by my read). She was
weaned off of BiPAP and placed on 2L oxygen by nasal cannula.
She was given one dose of levofloxacin 750 mg IV and Dilaudid 1
mg IV and admitted to the CCU given her tenuous respiratory
status. Urine output per [**Hospital1 **] records was 200 cc since arrival in
the ED. Her vitals at time of transfer were BP 151/60, HR 87,
satting 96% 2L, RR 16.

Of note, the patient was recently admitted and discharged two
weeks prior to this for worsening dyspnea. She was found on TTE
to have new severe mitral regurgitation and pulmonary
hypertension. A Swan-Ganz was placed that showed [**Hospital1 **]
pulmonary pressures, decreased SVR, and [**Hospital1 **] CO and CI. She
was tried on various meds to control her blood pressure and
reduce her afterload, including a nitroglycerine drip, a
nitroprusside drip, and IV hydralazine. With the afterload
reduction achieved by these medications, her dyspnea improved.
She was also diuresed with IV Lasix. Of note, while the patient
was in the CCU, she was evaluated by CT surgery for potential
mitral valve surgery in the future with plan for follow-up as
outpatient.

Of note, Lasix dose was recently decreased to 80 mg tablets
twice daily, every other day; this was decreased from one tablet
twice daily every day. This change was made one week ago by Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **].

In the interim since the last admission, patient reports that
she has been doing okay. This morning was her first episode of
shortness of breath.

Microbiologic Data:

Left ankle biopsy ([**2149-4-30**]): 11:25 am
TISSUE     Site: ANKLE      LEFT ANKLE.
GRAM STAIN (Final [**2149-4-30**]):
2+   (1-5 per 1000X FIELD):   POLYMORPHONUCLEAR LEUKOCYTES.
NO MICROORGANISMS SEEN.
TISSUE (Preliminary):    NO GROWTH.
ANAEROBIC CULTURE (Final [**2149-5-3**]):    NO GROWTH

Imaging Studies:

EKG ([**2149-4-28**]): Sinus rhythm. Low limb lead voltage. Since the
previous tracing the small R waves in leads V1-V2 are more
prominent, axis is more leftward and ST-T wave abnormalities are
more marked. Clinical correlation is suggested.

CXR ([**2149-4-28**]): FINDINGS: Single semi-upright portable view of
the chest was obtained. A right-sided PICC line is again seen,
terminating in the proximal SVC. Patient is status post median
sternotomy. Previously seen left lower lobe consolidation and
small left pleural effusion have essentially resolved with trace
left base residua of atelectasis and possible small amount of
consolidation. Surgical clips are seen overlying the right lung
base/breast. Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are unchanged.

Renal transplant ultrasound ([**2149-4-29**]): FINDINGS: Multiple
transverse and longitudinal son[**Name (NI) 1417**] of the renal transplant
were obtained. There is no hydronephrosis and
