Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2817**]
Chief Complaint:
Tracheomalacia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Bronchoscopy by IP [**2171-10-25**]

History of Present Illness:
67yo female with hx of HTN, Type 2 DM, [**Hospital 4747**] transferred from
[**Hospital 79264**] Medical Center ([**Hospital1 2177**]) s/p prolonged admission for
massive ventral wall hernia with incarcerated bowel complicated
by post-operative enterocutaneous fistula and prolonged
ventilator dependence requiring tracheostomy now transferred for
IP evaluation. She initially presented [**2171-7-9**] with weakness and
abdominal pain, and was found to have a large ventral hernia
with extensive necrosis and associated cellulitis of the
abdominal wall extending to her thighs. Wound cx + for Proteus,
E.Coli, MSSA and Serratia. She was taken to the operating [**2171-7-11**] (plastics and general surgery)for extensive debridement,
including lysis of significant adhesions and subtotal
ileocolectomy. Post-operatively, she developed a high-output
enterocutaneous fistula requiring TPN and octreotide.
She was initially able to be extubated, but had an episode of
desaturation with altered mental status (maintained BP and HR
throughout) post-op day #14 requiring re-intubation.
Subsequently, she was unable to be weaned from the ventilator,
so underwent tracheostomy post-op day #21 ([**2171-8-1**]). She was
weaned to trach mask, but has been unable to tolerate several
attempts at decanulation or even placement of speaking
valve/trach tube capping secondary to episodes of respiratory
distress. Bronchoscopy [**2171-10-11**] revealed subglottic stenosis with
granulation tissue by report. Bronchoscopy [**2171-10-17**] revealed
tracheomalacia (almost complete collapse of the trachea 2-3cm
distal to end of trach tube with inspiration) without signs of
stenosis. Given these findings, she was transferred to our
facility for IP evaluation and possible stenting.
Other active issues during [**Hospital1 2177**] admission:
C. diff colitis
B/l DVTs (L brachial vein in setting of a PICC), initially
treated with Heparin gtt
Line sepsis (Citrobacter, Coag Negative Staph)
Afib requiring diltiazem drip, digoxin
CHF
Pseudomonas and Klebsiella UTIs

Brief Hospital Course:
Pt is a 67yo female with hx of HTN, Type 2 DM, Afib transferred
from [**Hospital 79264**] Medical Center ([**Hospital1 2177**]) s/p prolonged admission for
massive ventral wall hernia with incarcerated bowel complicated
by post-operative enterocutaneous fistula and prolonged
ventilator dependence requiring tracheostomy now transferred for
IP evaluation

# Subglottic Stenosis/failure to decannulate:
Bedside bronchoscopy by IP [**2171-10-25**] revealed thick secretions,
adherent to trach. Trach removed and thoroughly cleaned.  There
was granulation tissue anteriorly starting 5mm below the vocal
cords and involving the cricoid and to the level of the stoma.
The posterior cricoid and trachea was not involved.  The trach
was removed and the scope passed into the mid trachea easily,
however the patient became hypoxic and the trach had to be
replaced.  Bronch via trach demonstrated thick secretions
bilaterally.  There was moderate tracheomalacia and severe
bilateral bronchomalacia.  Given likely tracheobronchitis and
comorbid conditions, IP did not feel that a stent would be
beneficial.  Malacia would not explain inability to cap trach,
SGS is the likely etiology.  ENT may be consulted at [**Hospital1 **] to consider CO2 laser for granulation tissue
ablation of the anterior trachea, however, this is unlikely to
be successful in the long run.  A laryngotracheal resection and
anastomosis would be the ideal solution should the patient
recover from her acute medical illnesses.  Tracheal stenting or
t-tube would not be helpful given the proximity to the vocal
cords.

# Tracheobronchitis:
BAL sent and cultures pending. Started on Vancomycin (hx of
MRSA) and Zosyn (hx of Serratia and Pseudomonas) [**2171-10-25**]
empirically pending cultures.  Should complete a course for
tracheobronchitis.

# Enterocutaneous fistula/Abdominal wound:
Pt unable to take po due to large output from fistula. Continued
wound vac and wound care per [**Hospital1 2177**] protocol, wound care consulted
for further recs. Continued octreotide per [**Hospital1 2177**] regimen for large
output. Continued TPN, albumin low at 1.9.

# Afib:
Continued current regimen of toprol, digoxin, and cardizem.

# History of DVTs:
Transferred on Coumadin. Coumadin held during this admission
given possibility of invasive procedure. INR on the day of
transfer was elevated at 3.6.

# Type 2 DM:
Continued fixed dose and sliding scale insulin. Followed
fingersticks per ICU protocol.

# Pain control: Morphine as needed.

# Nutrition: Continued TPN.

# Depression: Continued Celexa.

#Access: R PICC line placed at [**Hospital1 2177**]

#Code: DNR, confirmed with patient.
