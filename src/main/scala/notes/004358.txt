Brief Hospital Course:
On [**2141-10-14**], he underwent kidney transplant into right iliac
fossa. Surgeon was Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]. A double-J ureteral stent
was not placed due to small ureteral size. A 19 [**Doctor Last Name 406**] drain was
placed in the retroperitoneum. Induction immunosuppression (ATG,
solumedrol and cellcept)were administered. Please refer to
operative notes for complete details. After closing, he was
hypotensive requiring pressor support. ECG had new ST segment
depressions laterally and ST elevation in aVR. A NTG drip was
given. Cardiology was consulted. TTE was performed with moderate
LVH, MAC, small LVcavity, mild inferior and inferolateral HK but
overall preserved EF, and nl RV/septal motion. Cardiac enzymes
were checked showing a troponin leak. He was transferred to the
SICU where a heparin drip was run. Hypotensive response was felt
to be possibly due to ATG. Cardiology recomended lopressor and
statin with repeat TTE during this admission.

Hct dropped from 35 to 31. He was given PRBC. Heparin drip was
stopped and hct stabilized. Home doses of [**Doctor Last Name **] and plavix were
resumed.

A total of 3 doses of ATG were given after premedication with
tylenol/benadryl and higher doses of solumedrol as well as
slower administration of ATG. Over the next few days, urine
output increased to 3-4 liters and creatinine trended down to
5.5. Foley was removed without incident. IV fluids were stopped.
Diet was advanced and tolerated. Pain was controlled with oral
meds.

Extensive medication teaching was done. Steroids were tapered.
Cellect was well tolerated. Prograf was up-titrated to 12mg [**Hospital1 **]
for slowly rising prograf levels (7.7).

A repeat TTE was done per Cardiology demonstrating severe
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. Overall LVSF was normal
(LVEF>55%)with possible focal inferior hypokinesis (although not
seen consistently in all views). Doppler parameters were most
consistent with Grade II (moderate) left ventricular diastolic
dysfunction" and moderate pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension.  Lopressor doses were increased for SBPs up to
190. Home doses of hydralazine were resumed, isosorbide was
increased and Norvasc was added with some improvement of BP.

Of note, he required an insulin drip for a day to control
hyperglycemia from the steroids. This was switched to SQ insulin
(NPH and Humalog)with improved glucose control.

He was ambulatory. PT cleared him for home with a cane. VNA
services were arranged as he was discharged with his JP drain
which averaged 90-145cc of serosanuinous fluid.
