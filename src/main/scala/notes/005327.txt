Chief Complaint:
wound drainage

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
unsuccessful thoracentesis

History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **] y.o woman with hx of CAD s/p MI, CHF, h/o breast CA with XRT
c/b chronic osteo of the sterum, CRI, presents with 5 days of
worsening left chest wall discomfort, skin tenderness,
increasing and purulent drainage without fevres, chills, night
sweats.   She has also had worsening left arm swelling and pain
with movement of the left shoulder, however L arm swelling is
chronic.
.
Pt was recently on Cipro 500mg [**Hospital1 **] for wound infection by her
doctor after obtaining a wound swab.  However there was no
increase in tenderness, foul odor, or increased discharge at
that time.  Three months ago she had bleeding and clots from her
sternal wound, surgery was recommended at that time, but patient
refused.  Bleeding stopped on its own.
.
.
In the ED, initial VS were: 98.8 96 117/52 12 97. A CT chest was
done showeing worsening sternum, manubrium and medial clavicle
osteomyelitis, RUL consolidation, and left small to mod sized
empyema. Thoracic Surgery was consulted. Patient continued to
refuse surgical interventions. A thoracentesis was not
considered urgent given appearence. She was treated with
Solumedrol, Benadryl, Vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and Zosyn. Prior
to transfer, VS: 98.8 89 140/63 16 95/RA.

Physical Exam:
Vitals: T98.2   142/86   96   20   96RA
General: Alert, oriented, sitting upright, complaining of
sternal pain
HEENT: Sclera anicteric, MMM, oropharynx clear
Neck: supple, JVP not elevated, no LAD
Lungs: Good air movement bilaterally, reduced breath sounds and
rales at bases, no wheezes
CV: Regular rate and rhythm, multiple murmurs.  holosystolic
murmur at axilla, crescendo/decreascendo murmur at LUSB.
Abdomen: soft, non-tender, non-distended, bowel sounds present,
no rebound tenderness or guarding, no organomegaly
Ext: both shoulders with reduced range of passive and active
mostion, Left worse than right.  Left shouulder appears more
swollen.  Tenderness at AC joint to palpation, though moves
without too much pain.  No other edema, erythema.
Skin: chronic radiation  changes that are erythemetous around
all aspections of wound.  Faint blanching erythema and

Pertinent Results:
CT TORSO ([**2185-4-15**]):
POST-CONTRAST NECK CT: There is no abscess, fluid collection, or
soft tissue abnormality within the neck. Dental work is noted.
Multilevel degenerative changes of the spine are seen. The
submandibular glands and imaged oropharynx are unremarkable. The
major cervical vessels are patent. Thyroid gland is
unremarkable.
.
POST-CONTRAST CHEST CT: There is new, 19 x 17 mm, air-fluid
collection superior to the manubrium concerning for abscess at
the sternoclavicular
junction (2:26). There is adjacent significant soft tissue
swelling. There is increased destruction, fragmentation, and
sclerosis of the manubrium,
clavicles, and sternum compatible with worsening chronic
osteomyelitis. There is also increased osteolysis and bone
destruction at the upper-mid sternum as compared to prior study
(2:37) where an oblique sternal fracture was present; the
fractured fragments appear more distracted as well. No
subcutaneous tissue is seen overlying the area of osseous
destruction within the upper and mid sternum and to the left of
midline, with an overlying bandage again seen, unchanged from
prior.
Severe atherosclerotic calcifications of the aorta and coronary
arteries are seen. The heart is enlarged. There is trace
pericardial effusion. There is no mediastinal, hilar or axillary
lymphadenopathy by size criteria. The esophagus is severely and
diffusely dilated and contains fluid, placing the patient at
high risk for aspiration.
There is peripherally enhancing fluid collection in the left
lower lung
concerning for empyema. There is a small right pleural effusion
with adjacent atelectasis.
Paramediastinal radiation fibrosis is redemonstrated with
multifocal
bronchiectasis. Focal area of ground-glass opacity in the right
upper lobe
with adjacent nodular opacities are nonspecific and concerning
for
infectious/inflammatory etiologies. There is no pneumothorax.
Airways are
grossly patent.
The patient has undergone left radical mastectomy. Imaged upper
abdominal
organs are grossly unremarkable.
Degenerative changes of the spine are noted.
.
IMPRESSION:
1. Increased bone destruction, osteolysis and bone fragmentation
of the
sternum and manubrium with a 19-mm air and fluid collection at
the
sternoclavicular junction. Findings are compatible with
cellulitis, worsening chronic osteomyelitis and focal abscess
formation.
2. Left lower lobe peripheral enhancing pleural effusion
concerning for
empyema.
3. Right upper lobe area of ground-glass opacity, most
compatible with
pneumonia or an inflammatory process.
4. Unchanged marked and diffuse dilatation of the esophagus.

LEFT UPPER EXTREMITY U/S:
FINDINGS: Grayscale and Doppler evaluation of left internal
jugular,
axillary, brachial, basilic, cephalic vein demonstrates normal
compressibility, flow, response to augmentation wherever
applicable. The left subclavian vein on the other hand
