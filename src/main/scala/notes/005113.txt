Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2817**]
Chief Complaint:
headache. hypertensive emergency

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
lumbar puncture

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 20 y/o woman with PMH of ESRD on HD (last
dialyzed on Friday [**9-18**]) who presents with bilateral frontal
headache since last Tuesday. The patient tells us that the she
was discharged from an OSH in [**Hospital1 789**], RI last Tuesday; her
headache developed upon discharge. She cannot tell me the exact
moment that the headache came on just states that it "started."
She says the headache did not come on gradually and that it
waxes and wanes in severity. She reports photophobia without
scotomata. She denies any neurologic symptoms including
numbness/tingling of arms or legs, slurring of speech, or facial
asymmetry. She also denies fever, nausea, and vomiting. She has
never had a headache like this before. She does report some neck
stiffness; she has been unsteady on her feet due to her "feet
hurting." She has not missed any of her medications per her
report.
.
In the ED, she was initially started on a nipride gtt for BP
190/103. Her blood pressure decreased to 150s-160s systolic. CT
head was performed and did not demonstrate any acute
intracranial hemorrhage. She was then switched to nitroglycerin
gtt with resultant BPs 140s-150s. Labs in the ED demonstrated
initial K of 6.3 and the patient was given insulin, D50,
kayexalate, and calcium gluconate. Repeat K was 5.9. Cardiac
enzymes were sent due to mild lateral ST segment depressions; CK
was 30 with troponin 0.25 (no prior in our system). She received
morphine 2 mg X 2 for pain as well as aspirin 325 mg X 1.
.
The renal team was contact[**Name (NI) **] with plan to dialyze the patient in
the morning. She was maintained on nitroglycerin gtt and
transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for further management.
.
On arrival to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], the patient is complaining of [**6-14**]
fonrtal headache. She denies nausea or vomiting.
.
ROS: She reports recent diarrhea and right upper quadrant
abdominal pain. She says that her recent hospitalization for
shortness of breath was complicated by constipation for one
week. She has had loose bowel movements since being home. She
has also had intermittent right upper quadrant pain without an
obvious trigger. Her feet feel "puffy" but her breathing is
comfortable. She denies any chest pain or palpitations. She
denies dysuria and hematuria.

STUDIES:
CT head [**2116-9-20**]: 1. No evidence of intracranial hemorrhage or
edema.
2. Chronic small vessel ischemic changes and cerebral atrophy.
3. Phthisis bulbi of the left globe.
4. Near complete opacification of mastoid air cells bilaterally.
.
CT HEAD [**2116-9-22**]:
No change from prior study. No acute hemorrhage.
.
PARATHYROID ULTRASOUND [**2116-9-24**]:
No enlarged parathyroid gland identified. If high clinical
suspicion can correlate with Sestamibi nuclear scintigraphy.
.
PARATHYROID SCAN:
Following the intravenous injection of tracer, images of the
neck including anterior, pinhole and marker views were obtained
at 20 minutes.  At 2 hours pinhole views of the neck and
SPECT/CT of the neck and chest were obtained.
Initial images show tracer uptake in the thyroid and another
focus in the
mediastinum. 2 hour delayed pinhole image shows washout of
activity from the thyroid with no persistent focus in the neck.
SPECT/CT images show a persistent focus in the anterior
mediastinal, anterior to the superior vena cava. Sestamibi
uptake indicates tissue with high blood flow. In light of the
clinical scenario this would most likely represent a mediastinal
parathyroid adenoma.
Incidental note is made of right maxillary sinus polyp and
scoliosis.
IMPRESSION: Findings compatible with an anterior mediastinal
parathyroid
adenoma.  No persistent uptake identified in the neck.
.
CXR:
A right PIC catheter terminates within the
distal SVC.  A right subclavian hemodialysis catheter terminates
in the right atrium.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette and hilar
contours are within normal limits.  Hilar fullness is
significantly decreased from prior exam.  The pulmonary
vasculature remains minimally prominent, but is significantly
improved.  A small left pleural effusion is stable in size.
IMPRESSION:  Resolving pulmonary edema.  Stable, small left
pleural effusion.


Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: This is a 20 y/o F with ESRD secondary to type I DM on HD
here with headache X 6 days.
.
# Hypertensive emergency:  The patient presented to ED with BP
of 190s/100s and was initially started on a nitroprusside drip.
This was switched to a nitroglyercin drip in the ED due to her
renal failure and concern for cyanide toxicity.  This was
switched to labetolol on hospital day two and she was placed
back on her home antihypertensive regimen of losartan and
metoprolol on [**9-21**] and weaned off of the labetolol drip by [**9-22**]
with blood pressures in the 140s to 150s systolic.  Given that
her blood pressures appeared to be better controlled on
labetalol her metoprolol was switched to labetalol at equal
conversion. She was discharged on labetalol, losartan, and
nifedipine with good control of her blood pressure.
.
# Headache:  The patient presented with a severe [**10-14**] headache,
neck stiffness, nausea and photophobia.  She received two
non-contrast head CTs which were negative for acute hemmorhage.
On presentation she was anticoagulated for pulmonary embolism
with coumadin and her INR was elevated.  She received multiple
units of FFP with difficulty in normalizing her INR.  A lumbar
puncture was performed on [**9-23**] by neurology.  There w
