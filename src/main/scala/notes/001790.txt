HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 72-year-old male with
a known history of coronary artery disease, status post
percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty ten years ago.
He presented to an outside hospital emergency department on
[**2108-12-29**] with complaints of dyspnea.  He was found to be
bradycardiac with a heart rate in the 30's and had ST
depressions and congestive heart failure.  He was transferred
to [**Hospital1 69**] for evaluation and
treatment.  He was admitted to the hospital on [**2108-12-29**] via
the Medical Service and then referred to the Cardiology
service for treatment of his congestive heart failure and
evaluation of his coronary artery disease.  He was diuresed
over the first two days of admission.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Coronary artery disease status post percutaneous
   transluminal coronary angioplasty ten years ago.
2. Hypertension.
3. Congestive heart failure.

Please note, the patient denied a history of hypertension.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Tonsillectomy.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS:  At the time being seen by Cardiac Surgery
consult:
1. Cardizem 30 mg daily.
2. Aspirin 325 mg p.o. daily.

The patient lives with his wife, he works part time as an
instructor at the Buck [**Doctor Last Name **] Community College. He quit
smoking four years ago with an approximately 30 to 40 pack
year history. He admits to one glass of wine or beer at
dinner occasionally.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Noncontributory.

He stated that he was "exceedingly healthy."

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On examination he is 5 feet, 10 inches
tall, 175 pounds.  Blood pressure 150/70, heart rate 70,
respiratory rate 18, sating 96 percent on room air.  He was
laying flat in bed in no apparent distress when he was seen
on consult.  He was alert and oriented times three and
appropriate and grossly neurologically intact.  His lungs
were clear to auscultation bilaterally anteriorly.  His heart
was regular rate and rhythm with frequent premature
ventricular contractions and premature atrial contractions.
He had a Grade 1/6 systolic ejection murmur heard best at
apex.  His abdomen was soft, nontender, nondistended with
bowel sounds.  His extremities were warm and well perfused.
He had 2 plus radial pulses on the right, 1 plus on the left.
2 plus dorsalis pedis pulses on the right, 1 plus on the
left, 1 plus posterior tibial pulses on the right, 2 plus on
the left.

LABORATORY FINDINGS:  Preoperative labs were as follows,
white count 6.9, hematocrit 41.8, platelet count 167,000.
Sodium 143, creatinine 3.8, chloride 107, bicarbonate 26, BUN
16, creatinine 0.9 with a blood sugar of 164.  Preoperative
chest x-ray showed minimal upper zone redistribution and
small bilateral pleural effusions indicating possible left
heart failure.  No other significant cardiopulmonary
abnormality was identified.  Please refer to the final report
dated [**2108-12-30**].

Additional labs:  Protime 12.5, PTT 53.1, INR 1.2, ALT 15,
AST 15, alkaline phosphatase 59, total bilirubin 0.7, albumin
3.6.

Preoperative echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction of 15
percent and left ventricular hypokinesis.

The patient was treated for his congestive heart failure in
preparation for cardiac catheterization to evaluate his
coronary artery disease.  Cardiac catheterization was
performed on [**2108-12-31**] with the following results.  The patient
was right dominant coronary system.  He had a tapering 20
percent distal left main lesion, 80 percent left anterior
descending coronary artery lesion, 80 percent circumflex
lesion proximally and a 50 percent posterior descending
coronary artery lesion.  The patient was referred to Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] for coronary artery bypass surgery.

Urinalysis was negative.  Please refer to the final report.

The patient was seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  Risks and benefits of
surgery were discussed.  The patient's cardiac enzymes were
negative.  He was started on Carvedilol preop 3.125 mg p.o.
twice a day.  He was also continued on aspirin, Lipitor and
intravenous Heparin therapy.  Given his poor ejection
fraction Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] requested a myocardial viability study
which showed that there was perfused myocardium.  The patient
had a left bundle branch block on electrocardiogram
preoperatively as well as  many premature ventricular
contractions.

The patient was accepted for coronary surgery and on [**2109-1-3**]
underwent coronary artery bypass graft times two by Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] with a left internal mammary artery to the left
anterior descending coronary artery and vein graft to the
circumflex.  He was transferred to Cardiothoracic intensive
care unit in stable condition.  Of note, Swann-Ganz catheter
was unable to be placed in the operating room despite
multiple attempts under echocardiography by Anesthesia Team.
The patient was transported to the cardiac catheter
laboratory prior to the start of his surgery for Fluoroscopic
placement of a right IJ Swann.  Fluoroscopy and injection at
Catheter laboratory revealed a communication of the right IJ
with a persistent left SVC without flow through any right
SVC.  Swann-Ganz catheter in the Catheterization Laboratory
was placed using left femoral vein approach.  Please refer to
the Catheterization laboratory report dated [**2109-1-3**].

On postop day one the patient had no events overnight,
remained ventilated on Propofol drip at 0.8 mcg per kg per
minute.  He was also on an epinephrine drip at 1.0 and
Lidocaine drip at 2.0.  Postop labs are as follows:  White
count 10, hematocrit 31, K 4.1, BUN 11, creatinine 0.9 with a
blood sugar of 90.

On postoperative evening on [**2109-1-3**] the Swann-Ganz catheter
was inadvertently pulled out.  The Swann-Ganz catheter was
refloated by Cardiology under fluoroscopy in the
Cardiothoracic Intensive care unit.  The patient continued to
be followed as he was preoperatively by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] from
Cardiology Heart Failure Service.  On postop day two the
patient was extubated and was weaned off his epinephrine
drip.  Lasix diuresis was begun.  He was hemodynamically
stable at blood pressure 117/56, slightly tachycardiac in the
90's but sating at 96 percent on four liters nasal cannula.
Melranone drip continued at 0.4 mcg per kg per minute and
insulin drip at 4 units per hour.  His creatinine remained
stable at 1.0, the patient was doing well.  Was alert and
oriented appropriately and he remained in the CSRU for
monitoring.

On postop day three, Melranone drip was weaned off, Neo-
Synephrine was off, the patient remained on an insulin drip
at 3 units per hour.  His Carvedilol was restarted at 3.125
mg p.o. twice a day to try and bring his heart rate back
down.  On examination his heart rate was at 78 with
Carvedilol in sinus rhythm and a stable blood pressure
110/51.  His hematocrit also remained stable at 30.6.  Swann-
Ganz catheter was removed later in the day as was the cortis
introducer and his radial A-line.

On postop day four the patient's pacing wires were removed.
He was switched over to p.o. Percocet for pain.  He was
hemodynamically stable, alert and oriented.  His examination
was unremarkable.  Incisions were clean, dry and intact.  His
pacing wires were removed.  He continued on his aspirin
therapy and Ace inhibitor therapy was restarted with
Lisinopril at 2.5 mg p.o. once daily.  The patient was
transferred out to the floor where he was evaluated by
physical therapy and continued to be seen by the Congestive
Heart Failure fellow every day who recommended continuing him
on Carvedilol.  The patient did have some slightly
erythematous areas over his coccyx with some broken skin
spots.  His coccyx was covered with DuoDerm for protection,
also a small area of skin sloughing and to help keep the area
cleaned.  He also had some small skin tears at his right
groin catheter site, this was also treated with DuoDerm, his
incisions continued to heal.  The patient was out of bed and
ambulating.  He had occasional premature atrial contractions
on telemet
