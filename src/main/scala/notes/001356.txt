CONTRAINDICATIONS FOR IV CONTRAST:
   None.



Wet Read: AKSb SAT [**2163-4-16**] 5:25 PM
Focal SAH in the perimesencephalic and prepontine cisterns. No
definite
aneurysm or AVM identified. Possible etiologies include
perimesencephalic
(venous) bleed, or AVM/aneurysm obscured by hemorrhage. d/w
Neurosurg.


Final Report
INDICATION: 31-year-old with history of sudden onset worst
headache of life
with moderate subarachnoid hemorrhage on outside hospital CT.
Evaluate for
aneurysm.

No prior examinations available for comparison.

TECHNIQUE: Non-contrast CT of the head was performed, followed
by enhanced
CTA of the circle of [**Location (un) 431**] including multiplanar and
volume-rendered images.

NON-CONTRAST HEAD CT: There is high attenuation focal hemorrhage
within the perimesencephalic and prepontine cisterns. No
extension of hemorrhage within the ventricles and no evidence of
hydrocephalus. No additional foci of subarachnoid hemorrhage.
High attenuation area along the left tentorium
likely represents a sagittal sinus (2:11). The visualized
paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are normally pneumatized
and aerated.

CTA: The visualized course of intracranial carotid and vertebral
arteries and their major branches are normal. There is no
evidence of stenosis, occlusion, or aneurysm formation.

IMPRESSION: Focal subarachnoid hemorrhage within the
perimesencephalic and
prepontine cisterns, without a definite aneurysm seen on the
CTA. Differential considerations included a perimesencephalic
(venous) hemorrhage or an occult aneurysm or AVM.

Findings were discussed with the neurosurgical team at the time
of the exam.


The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
   eval for bleed
CONTRAINDICATIONS FOR IV CONTRAST:
   None.



Provisional Findings Impression: DFDkq SUN [**2163-4-17**] 6:12 PM
Subarachnoid hemorrhage in the perimesencephalic and prepontine
cisterns, as well as in the sulci of both convexities. Normal
MRA of the neck. MRA of the head is slightly limited by motion,
but no aneurysms are identified.


Final Report
INDICATION: Subarachnoid hemorrhage.

COMPARISON: Head CTA performed on [**2163-4-16**] and
conventional cerebral
angiogram performed on [**2163-4-16**].

TECHNIQUE: Sagittal T1-weighted and axial T1-weighted,
T2-weighted, FLAIR,
gradient echo, and diffusion-weighted images of the head.
Three-dimensional time-of-flight MRA of the head. Dynamic
coronal VIBE imaging of the neck obtained during intravenous
gadolinium administration. Following intravenous gadolinium
administration, multiplanar T1-weighted images of the head were
obtained.

HEAD MRI: T1 isointense and T2 hypointense blood products are
seen in the
perimesencephalic and prepontine cisterns, corresponding to the
subarachnoid hemorrhage seen on the non-contrast portion of the
preceding head CTA. In addition, there is high signal in the
sulci on FLAIR images involving the right frontal, bilateral
parietal, and bilateral occipital lobes. This is consistent with
additional subarachnoid hemorrhage which is occult by CT. There
is no evidence of edema, infarction, mass or other pathologic
enhancement in the brain. There is no evidence of a meningeal
mass. The ventricles are normal in size and configuration.

NECK MRA: The cervical common carotid, internal carotid, and
vertebral
arteries appear normal. The distal cervical internal carotid
arteries measure at least 4 mm in diameter.

HEAD MRA: The study is slightly limited by artifacts. Flow is
seen in the
intracranial internal carotid and vertebral arteries, and their
major
branches, without evidence of stenoses or aneurysms.

IMPRESSION:

1. Subarachnoid hemorrhage in the basal cisterns as well as in
the cerebral sulci.

2. Normal neck MRA.

3. Unremarkable head MRA.

Final Report
REASON FOR EXAMINATION: Decrease in saturations in a patient
with
subarachnoid hemorrhage.

Portable AP chest radiograph was reviewed with no comparison to
the prior
studies. There is a large opacity in the left lower lung most
likely
involving the left lower lobe and lingula. There is additional
opacity in the right lower lobe. The findings are concerning for
bilateral aspiration or multifocal pneumonia. Slight left
ventricle engorgement is present also may be projectional due to
the position of this film. No appreciable pleural effusion is
demonstrated.




Brief Hospital Course:
Pt was admitted through the emergency room after transfer from
OSH for perimesencephalic hemorrhage after working out at
