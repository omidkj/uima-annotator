Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 898**]
Chief Complaint:
Sepsis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
ICD interrogation on [**1-7**]


History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 76 male with PMH signficant for CAD s/p MIx2,
VF arrest, CHF (EF 20%) s/p BiV ICD, Afib on warfarin and
mexiletine, CKD p/w progressively increasing productive cough
and lethargy x5 days. Patient denies fevers/chills, runny
nose/sore throat, SOB/chest pain, palpitations.  He also
reported decreased POs since discharge from rehab on [**1-2**] after
girdlestone procedure, but denied abdominal pain,
nausea/vomiting. The patient was referred to the ED by his PCP
on the day of admission given his symptoms, and was initially
sent to [**Hospital 1281**] Hospital (closest to home in [**Location (un) 1456**]).
.
Of note, he had had a 4lb weight gain immediately following d/c
from rehab, his dose of lasix was increased to 30mg PO x1 day
(since being back on 10mg/day) and is now 4lbs down from rehab
d/c weight.
.
In the ED at the OSH a CXR was performed which reportedly showed
a pneumonia per [**Hospital1 18**] ED call in.  He received 500mg PO
levofloxacin and was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] ED for further care
given this is his primary hospital.
.
Upon transfer to our ED, initial vitals were T 99.1 HR 98 BP
102/69 RR 20 O2 sat 100% 2L NC.  He received 1g IV ceftriaxone
and 500mg azithromycin. His BPs were consistently 90s-low 100s
while in the ED, and in the setting of probable pneumonia, he is
being admitted to the ICU for further monitoring and care.
.
ROS:  +30lb weight loss over 6 months.  Denies fevers/chills.
No dysuria/hematuria.  No blood in stool, dark tarry stool.  No
rashes, no joint pain.

.
[**1-10**] EKG: Atrial fibrillation with moderate ventricular response.
Underlying ventricularly paced rhythm. There are occasional
[**Month/Day (4) **] spikes which are non-conducted. Occasional ventricular
premature beats are also noted. Low QRS voltage in the limb
leads. Compared to the previous tracing
of [**2114-11-22**] atrial fibrillation with occasional ventricular
paced rhythm
persists. However, ventricular premature beats are new. Clinical

correlation is suggested.

CXR. [**2115-1-10**]
1. New retrocardiac opacity consistent with atelectasis.
2. Opacity within the right lung base which has been noticed to
be present on several previous radiographs. Recommend repeat
radiographs with nipple markers in both neutral frontal and 10
degree oblique views to assess weather this represents overlying
soft tissue (favored) rather than a developing pneumonia.

[**2115-1-17**] CXR AP port: The heart size is moderately enlarged,
slightly increased in size compared to the previous study. There
is significant increase in bilateral perihilar opacities and
bronchial wall thickening continuing towards the lower lungs
with bilateral increase in currently moderate-to-small pleural
effusion, finding consistent with pulmonary edema.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient is a 76 year-old male with CAD s/p MI x 2, VF
arrest, CHF with EF 20-25% in [**9-15**] s/p ICD placement, A. fib,
and CKD admitted with pneumonia. He was initially treated with
Levaquin at an OSH ED and transferred here to [**Hospital1 18**], where he
had a short MICU course for concern of hypotension. The patient
was found to have baseline low blood pressure in the 90s-100s
systolic. His MICU course was complicated by low urine output
that responded to IVF. Patient was treated with ceftriaxone and
azithromycin with improvement of WBC and cough. Remainder of
hospital course is by problem:
.
# Pneumonia: Admission CXR showed a RLL opacity, possibly
chronic, consisted with soft tissue v. infiltrate as well as a
retrocardiac opacity representing atelectasis v. infiltrate. The
patient had a productive cough and leukocytosis concerning for
