showed a large peri-rectal abscess. I&D was done. General
Surgery was consulted who recommended conservative therapy as
the lesion was already draining. His ED course was complicated
by hypotension with a nadir sbp to 73/50. He did receive single
doses of diluadid and morphine for rectal pain ~1 hour prior to
hypotension starting. Sepsis protocol was started. He received
vanc/unasyn. A RIJ was placed. He received a total of 1.5 liters
of crystalloid. Blood, urine, swab cultures were taken. Initial
lactate was 2.4 with repeat 1.2.
