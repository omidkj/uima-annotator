Service: SURGERY

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1234**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath, LE edema

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2188-4-17**] OPERATION:
1. Ultrasound-guided puncture of the left common femoral
    artery.
2. Contralateral second-order catheterization of the right
    external iliac artery.
3. Serial arteriogram of the right lower extremity.
4. Abdominal aortogram.

[**2188-4-24**]
Right iliofemoral and profunda femoral artery
endarterectomy with saphenous vein patch angioplasty.


History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **] M with A fib, CHF, HTN, HL, s/p recent L colectomy for [**Female First Name (un) 899**]
bleed complicated by NSTEMI and ARF presents with SOB an
dincreasing LE edema.  Patient is a poor historian.  Reports
that he was having SOB for many months now and that more
recently it has been getting slightly worse.  Has noticed that
his legs have been more swollen since his surgery in [**Month (only) 547**].
Minimal exertion will cause him ot become fairly winded,
something that is not completely new to him, but is worse than
it used to be.  Patient otherwise thinks that he has been
admitted because of his right heel ulcer.
.
In the ED, initial VS: 97.0, 68, 121/53, 24, 97%RA.  He was
found to have a BNP of [**Numeric Identifier **].  Because of symptoms of volume
overload and diffuse crackles on lung exame and bilateral LE
edema, he was given 40 mg IV lasix.  A V/Q scan was also
performed which showed low probability of PE.
.
Currently patient feels well, breathing feels better,
comfortable.  Wants to know what will be done about his foot,
whether he will get an angiogram or amputation.

Past Medical History:
-recent admission for [**Female First Name (un) 899**] bleed requiring colectomy and 21 units
of pRBCs.  Admission also complicated by NSTEMI and ARF.
-Hypertension
-Hyperlipidemia
-benign bladder tumors
-atrial fibrillation
-distant h/o gout in right LE

Pertinent Results:
LUNG SCAN Study Date of [**2188-4-11**]
INTERPRETATION:
Ventilation images obtained with Tc-[**Age over 90 **]m aerosol in 8 views
demonstrate a large defect in the posterior right lower lobe and
a defect along the minor fissure.
Perfusion images in the same 8 views show a smaller defect in
the posterior right lower lobe.
Chest x-ray shows cardiomegaly with pulmonary vascular
congestion and bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than
left.
The above findings are consistent with a low-probability scan,
with matched defects that are worse on ventilation than
perfusion images.
IMPRESSION: Low probability for PE. Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name (STitle) **] was notified
on [**2188-4-11**] at 5 PM.

[**2188-4-23**]
CXR:
Final Report
PROCEDURE: Chest preop PA and lateral.

REASON FOR EXAM: Preoperative

FINDINGS: In comparison to the previous chest radiograph,
bilateral layering
pleural effusions are minimally changed allowing for differences
in patient
positioning. The appearance of the right pleural effusion is
slightly unusual
with a lucency in the upper margins of the fluid suggesting
loculation. A
lucent line along the lateral right costal margin is probably
due to overlying
soft tissue structures. Pulmonary vascular congestion is mild
and unchanged.

IMPRESSION:
Large right and small left layering pleural effusions with mild
vascular
congestion. The findings were discussed with the referring team

The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

Findings
This study was compared to the prior study of [**2188-3-18**].
LEFT ATRIUM: Mild LA enlargement.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Mildly dilated RA.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Mild symmetric LVH with normal cavity size.
Moderate regional LV systolic dysfunction. Moderately depressed
LVEF. TDI E/e' >15, suggesting PCWP>18mmHg. No resting LVOT
gradient.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Dilated RV cavity. Focal apical hypokinesis of
RV free wall. Prominent moderator band/trabeculations are noted
in the RV apex.

AORTA: Moderately dilated aortic sinus.

AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS.
Mild (1+) AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Moderately thickened mitral valve leaflets. No
MVP. Moderate mitral annular calcification. Moderate (2+) MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Tricuspid valve not well visualized. Moderate
to severe [3+] TR. Moderate PA systolic hypertension.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Pulmonic valve not well seen.

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: Suboptimal image quality - poor echo windows.
Suboptimal image quality - body habitus. Ascites.

REGIONAL LEFT VENTRICULAR WALL MOTION:





     N = Normal, H = Hypokinetic, A = Akinetic, D = Dyskinetic
Conclusions
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is
moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
focal severe hypokinesis of the distal left ventricle and
dyskinesis of the apex. There is also hypokinesis of the entire
inferior wall and inferior septum . Overall left ventricular
systolic function is moderately depressed (LVEF= 30-35 %).
