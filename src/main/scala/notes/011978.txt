Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2160**]
Chief Complaint:
S/P fall with intracranial hemorrhage

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
This is a 70 y/o male with a PMH significant for MDS, CAD s/p MI
in [**2180**] and [**2182**], possible CHF, who presented on [**2184-5-11**]
following a fall from a ladder on [**2184-5-10**], resulting in hitting
his head. He began having left-sided weakness at home, prompting
him to go to an OSH for evaluation. He was found to have a
subarachnoid hemorrhage and intraparenchymal hemorrhage
involving the frontal and right parietal lobe and was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] ED for further evaluation. He was admitted
to the neurosurgical ICU and monitored closely overnight without
any intervention. His platelets on admission were 38 (baseline)
and Hct was 21.5, so he was transfused 2 units of PRBCs and
platelets. He had a repeat head CT on [**5-11**] that was stable, and
was transferred to the floor and ultimately the medicine service
on [**2184-5-12**].
.
On [**2184-5-12**], he had respiratory distress overnight off of O2
(increased RR) and required 4 L O2 to achieve normoxia. His IVF
were d/c'd (started on admission) and he received 20 mg IV lasix
along with his regular 80 mg oral dose, with good effect. Today,
the patient desaturated again on 4 L to 88-90%, requiring 50% O2
by facemask, and was noted to be tachypneic to the 20s-30s. He
received 20 mg IV lasix x 2 and his regular 80 mg po dose, with
an output of 2.8 L thus far. Per nursing, has been having
increased secretions with periodic desaturations, which resolve
with suctioning. Repeat CXR was significant for worsening
pulmonary edema. In addition, he spiked a temperature to 101.8
this afternoon.
.
Of note, the patient has been O2-dependent at home on 2 L NC
since his MI in [**2182**]. Has had worsening LE edema after his MI in
[**2182**], requiring an increase in lasix dose (40->80 mg daily) and
was recently on metolazone with good effect.
.
Currently, the patient reports slight difficulty breathing, but
denies any chest pain, dizziness/LH. +sweats. Denies any cough,
abdominal pain, nausea/vomiting, diarrhea, or dysuria.


Past Medical History:
1. Seizure disorder
2. Myelodysplastic syndrome, requires weekly transfusions -
baseline Hct 21-23, plts 20-30, WBC [**2-24**]
3. CAD, s/p MI [**2180**] with balloon angioplasty, s/p MI [**11-28**] with

MR HEAD W & W/O CONTRAST  [**2184-5-11**] 8:05 PM

MR HEAD W & W/O CONTRAST

Reason: please evaluate for underlying mass as source of
hemorrhage.
Contrast: MAGNEVIST

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
70 year old man with subarachnoid and intraparenchymal bleeds
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
please evaluate for underlying mass as source of hemorrhage.
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.

HISTORY: 70-year-old male with subarachnoid and intraparenchymal
hemorrhages after fall.

COMPARISON: CT head of [**2184-5-11**].

TECHNIQUE: Axial T1, FLAIR, T2, gradient echo, and
diffusion-weighted images as well as sagittal T1-weighted images
were acquired prior to administration of IV contrast. Subsequent
multiplanar T1-weighted imaging was performed after
administration of IV gadolinium.

MR HEAD: A 3.7 x 1.8 cm right frontal parafalcine
intraparenchymal hemorrhage with mild surrounding edema is
grossly unchanged in appearance compared to the CT performed
earlier on the same day at 10:33. Regions of subarachnoid
hemorrhage are also noted in the bilateral frontal and parietal
lobes, also unchanged. A small amount of intraventricular
hemorrhage is noted in both occipital horns. In addition, a tiny
focus of gradient echo signal drop-out in the right occipital
lobe (9:10) likely represents a focus of microhemorrhage; no
other foci of microhemorrhage are seen.

There is no shift of normally midline structures, hydrocephalus,
or loss of the basal cisterns. There is no region of diffusion
abnormality to suggest underlying infarction. No region of
abnormal enhancement is seen to suggest underlying mass. The
normal vascular flow voids are demonstrated. No MRI signs of
venous sinus thrombosis are seen. Decreased T1-weighted signal
in the clivus may relate to myelodysplastic changes or an
infiltrative process. The paranasal sinuses and mastoid air
cells remain well aerated. The patient is status post bilateral
lens replacement.

IMPRESSION:
1. Right frontal parafalcine intraparenchymal hemorrhage,
multiple foci of subarachnoid hemorrhage, and tiny bilateral
intraventricular hemorrhage unchanged. Tiny focus of
susceptibility artifact in the right occipital lobe may
represent focus of microhemorrhage.
2. No definite evidence of underlying mass, infarct or vascular
abnormality.
3. Decreased T1 signal in t
