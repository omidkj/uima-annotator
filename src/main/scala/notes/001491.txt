Service:  [**Hospital1 **]

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname 14129**] was admitted on
[**2195-1-9**] to the Medical Intensive Care Unit.

He is an 81-year-old white male with chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease who was admitted to the Medical Intensive
Care Unit with a pneumothorax, status post a bronchoscopy
with multiple biopsies on [**1-9**].

The patient had been in his usual state of health until one
month prior to admission.  He had been admitted to [**Hospital **]
Hospital with a chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
exacerbation.   A chest computed tomography at that time
revealed new significant right upper lobe mass which was
worrisome for bronchoalveolar carcinoma.  The patient had
multiple small nodules in the past which have been biopsied
showing macronodular pulmonary amyloid.  Computed tomography
also showed a left-sided pneumothorax that was not treated at
that time.

At bronchoscopy on [**1-9**], multiple biopsies were taken.
He had acute shortness of breath five minutes prior to the
end of the procedure and required nebulizers.  He received
albuterol times three and Atrovent times one with
improvement, and a subsequent x-ray revealed a large
right-sided pneumothorax.  The pneumothorax was noted and
attempted conservative management with nebulizers and
high-flow oxygen.  At that point, he failed conservative
treatment, and a right-sided chest tube was placed for
respiratory distress.  The lung was reinflated, and he was
again made comfortable.  His shortness of breath was
resolved.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
2.  Macronodular pulmonary amyloidosis diagnosed in [**2194-1-4**].
3.  New pulmonary nodule in the right upper lobe.
4.  Peripheral vascular disease; status post bilateral
vascular surgery.
5.  Abdominal aortic aneurysm measured at 4.4 cm X 2.4 cm.
6.  Hypercholesterolemia.
7.  History of atrial fibrillation.
8.  History of an anterior neck mass.
9.  Lupus anticoagulation.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1.  Albuterol 2 puffs four times per day.
2.  Atrovent 2 puffs four times per day.
3.  Lipitor 40 mg p.o. q.d.
4.  Aspirin.
5.  Digoxin 0.25 mcg p.o. q.d.
6.  Quinidine 324 mg p.o. times two b.i.d.
7.  Serevent two times per day.
8.  Lasix 10 mg p.o. q.d.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  One son and two daughters.  [**Name (NI) **] works at a
dry cleaning shop.  He quit tobacco in [**2148**] after 50 pack
years.  Occasional alcohol.  No intravenous drug abuse.

FAMILY HISTORY:   No history of pulmonary disease.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:   Physical examination
revealed temperature was 97.4, blood pressure was 128/60,
heart rate was 72, respiratory rate was 20, oxygen saturation
was 90% on face mask and 95% on room air.  In no acute
distress.  Spoke in complete sentences.  Lungs revealed
bilateral breath sounds were equal.  Poor inspiratory effort.
Moved air in all fields.  Cardiovascular examination revealed
a regular rate and rhythm.  No murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
The abdomen was soft, nontender, and nondistended.  Active
bowel sounds.  Extremities revealed no clubbing, cyanosis, or
edema.

RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:   A chest x-ray on [**1-13**] at 7 a.m.
showed no pneumothorax.

HOSPITAL COURSE:

1.  PULMONARY SYSTEM:  Status post bronchoscopy complicated
by a pneumothorax.  The pneumothorax was initially attempted
conservatively, but conservative treatment failed and a
right-sided chest tube was subsequently required to relieve
respiratory distress.  The chest tube resolved the
pneumothorax, and the patient's respiratory distress was much
improved.  He was continued on his outpatient chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease medications including
albuterol, Atrovent, and Serevent.

On [**1-12**], the chest tube was switched from suction to
water seal.  Again, no pneumothorax developed.  At 4 p.m. on
[**1-12**], the patient stood up and the chest tube was
accidentally discontinued.  An occlusive Vaseline gauze
dressing was applied with minimal air leak.

A subsequent chest x-ray revealed no reaccumulation of the
pneumothorax but some subcutaneous air.  The patient was
maintained on oxygen over the course of the next night
without any respiratory distress or other symptoms.  A chest
x-ray on the morning of discharge revealed no reaccumulation
of the pneumothorax.  The patient had been stable for greater
than 24 hours status post the discontinuation of the chest
tube.

The preliminary pathology results on the bronchoscopy
specimens revealed a resolving pneumonia and amyloid.  No
evidence of bronchoalveolar carcinoma.

2.  CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE:  The patient was
maintained on his Atrovent, albuterol, and Serevent without
any problems.

3.  CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM:  The patient was cardiovascularly
stable throughout his hospital stay with the exception of
some hypertension at the time of bronchoscopy.  At the time
of discharge, the patient had been hemodynamically stable for
greater than 48 hours.  He was restarted on his home
medications of digoxin and quinidine on [**2195-1-12**].  He
also was maintained on Lasix.

4.  FLUIDS/ELECTROLYTES/NUTRITION:  The patient was
maintained on a regular diet.  Electrolytes and laboratories
were stable.

5.  PROPHYLAXIS:  The patient had been getting out of bed and
moving consistently.  He was taking an oral diet.  He was
only requiring Pneumo boots while in bed.

6.  HYPERCHOLESTEROLEMIA:  The patient was continued on
Lipitor.

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  Condition on discharge was good.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  The patient was discharged to home.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
1.  Percocet one tablet p.o. q.4-6h. for pain as needed.
2.  Albuterol 2 puffs four times per day.
3.  Atrovent 2 puffs four times per day.
5.  Lipitor 40 mg p.o. q.d.
6.  Aspirin.
7.  Digoxin 0.25 mcg p.o. q.d.
7.  Quinidine 324 mg p.o. times two b.i.d.
8.  Serevent two times per day.
9.  Lasix 10 mg p.o. q.d.

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS/FOLLOWUP:
1.  The patient was to follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 217**] as
indicated by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 217**] to the patient.
2.  Return to the Emergency Department if any shortness of
breath, fevers, chills, chest pain, or any other questions or
concerns.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:  Right-sided pneumothorax.
