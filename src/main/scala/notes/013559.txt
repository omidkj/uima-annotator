Chief Complaint:
Clots per rectum and hematemesis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Endoscopy

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 26237**] is an 82 y/o male with a PMH of alzheimers dementia,
DM, CHF, PVD (stent x2, most recent [**5-/2101**]) s/p left AKA and
ulcers on right foot. He also has a h/o intermittent anemia
believed to be [**3-16**] GI blood loss with EGD in [**2100**] and
colonoscopy x2, most recently in [**2101-4-12**]. Transfused as
outpatient on [**2101-8-23**]. On [**9-5**], the patient was noted to have
passed moderately sized clots per rectum and had BRB in her
stool.  The following AM he vomitted small amounts of brownish
coffee-ground liquid. The patient endorses abd pain with these
episodes.
.
In the ED, the patient's vitals were 112  145/74  30  100% 4L
NC. He was triggered given his GI bleed.  Stool was guaiac +.
Lavage through G-tube brought back coffee-ground appearing
material. Transfused 1 unit of PRBCs and started on ppi drip. CT
abd/pelv done and wet read does not show any acute
intra-abdominal process.  CXR showed a patchy opacity at Right
lung base. Given 1 dose vanc for foot ulcers and ceftriaxone for
opacity seen on CXR. Also received 10u regular insulin for BS
425. Seen by GI in the ED who will do colonoscopy and possibly
EGD in AM.  HD stable and transferred to MICU.
.
On arrival to the MICU the patient appears ill with vitals T:
98.8 BP: 155/70 P: 111 R: 18 O2: 99%RA.  Accompanied by sister
[**Name (NI) 24606**].

CXR [**9-6**]-IMPRESSION: Limited study as above. Patchy opacity at
the right lung base may be due to atelectasis, although an
aspiration or focal pneumonia cannot be excluded on the basis of
this examination.
.
R Foot Xray [**9-6**]-IMPRESSION: Nearly nondiagnostic radiographs
due to profound diffuse osteopenia and flexion deformity of the
digits. Within those limitations, however, there is suggestion
of changed and abnormal morphology involving the second middle
phalanx which may be due to underlying osteomyelitis. Please
note, not mentioned above, severe degenerative change is again
evident at the first interphalangeal joint similar to the prior
exams.
.
CT C/A/P [**9-6**]-No acute intra-abd or pelvic process, specifically
no e/o diverticulitis or obstruction. Bibasilar consolidative
opacities could be atelectasis, but infection or aspiration also
possible.

[**9-7**] Duplex LE US FINDINGS: PVRs were obtained throughout the
right lower extremity. This demonstrates significant flow
deficit, most marked in the right forefoot.  However, amplitudes
are decreased from the below-knee region inferiorly.  Today's
exam, flow velocities were not obtained, in the intensive care.

[**9-7**] Upper endoscopy:  FINDINGS: PVRs were obtained throughout
the right lower extremity. This demonstrates significant flow
deficit, most marked in the right forefoot.  However, amplitudes
are decreased from the below-knee region inferiorly.  Today's
exam, flow velocities were not obtained, in the intensive care.

[**9-8**] KUB:  no air under the diaphraghm.

Aerobic Bottle Gram Stain (Final [**2101-9-7**]):   Coag neg staph,
No other blood cultures were positive.


Brief Hospital Course:
Assessment and Plan: The patient is an 82 y/o male with multiple
medical problems including h/o anemia likely secondary to slow
GI bleed who presents with BRBPR and hematemesis. Most likely
UGI source given presence of hemoptysis and coffee-ground
material on G-tube lavage.

#. GI Bleed-The patient presents with clots per rectum and small
amounts of hematemsis. Hemodynamically stable but found to have
coffee-ground material on G-tube lavage. Stools were guiac
positive. He was transfered to the MICU for close observation.
Medium internal hemorrhoids were noted on colonoscopy [**5-/2101**] and
Colonoscopy [**10/2100**] showed adenomatous polyp in the sigmoid colon
as well as diverticulosis of the whole colon.  Patient had upper
endoscopy preformed by GI which showed Thin layer of old blood
present over stomach. Large adherent clot seen in fundus. No red
blood was seen. Patient was transfused a total 3 units of PRBC
in the MICU with an appropriate rise in his hematocrit (received
a total of 5 UPRBC between the ED and MICU).  He was initially
treated with a PPI drip and transitioned to IV pantoprazole [**Hospital1 **].
 HCT was stable over the course of his MICU stay. He was then
transfered to the medical floor where he had 2 melena bowel
movements. However, this was thought likely secondary to
remnants of his recent GI bleed since his HCT remained stable at
31 range. He required no further blood transfusions. He will go
back to rehab on pepcid 40mg [**Hospital1 **] daily.

#. Healthcare Associated Pneumonia -
Mr. [**Known lastname 26237**] was found to have right lower lobe consolidations on
CXR upon admission.  Started on ceftriaxone in the ED, but there
was concern for Hospital acquired pna as patient was arriving
from a nursing home. He was started on cefepime, vancomycin and
azithromycin emperically upon arrival to the MICU.  He was
afebrile, admited to some mild cough. He was continued on broad
spectrum coverage for 6 days.  Legionella antige
