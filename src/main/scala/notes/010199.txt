Family declined surgery and pt was amde DNR.

Past Medical History:

CT CHEST W&W/O C   [**2126-12-12**] 5:37 PM

Reason: eval ptx, esoph injury
Field of view: 36

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
78 year old man with esoph dilation, now c free air under
diaphragm
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
eval ptx, esoph injury
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.

INDICATION: 78-year-old man with esophageal dilatation of free
air under diaphragms. Evaluate for pneumothorax or esophageal
injury.

IMPRESSION:
1. Posterior mediastinal emphysema centered around the esophagus
after attempted dilatation of esophageal stricture, highly
suggestive of esophageal perforation. No extravasation of orally
instilled contrast material. No pneumothorax or free intra-
abdominal air.
2. Right lower lobe consolidative process suspicious for
pneumonia. Associated small bilateral pleural effusions.
3. Calcified pleural plaques bilaterally suggestive of prior
asbestos exposure.
4. Left lower lobe nodule. A followup CT and 3-6 months is
recommended to assess for resolution/stability.
5. Hypoattenuating lesions in the right kidney, most of which
are too small to characterize. Ultrasound could be performed for
further evaluation.
6. Cholelithiasis without evidence of cholecystitis.
7. Calcified granulomas in the liver indicating prior
granulomatous disease.
8. Hypoenhancing lesion with peripheral contrast puddling in
segment V of the liver most likely representing hemangioma.
Additional hypoenhancing lesion in segment VIII of the liver,
incompletely characterized. These lesions should be further
assessed with ultrasound or MRI.
9. Multiple thoracic wedge compression fractures, stable
compared to prior plain radiographs.
10. Small bilateral pleural effusions.

                         Date:  [**2126-12-20**]
PROCEDURE:  Laparotomy and gastrostomy tube and jejunostomy
tube placement.



Brief Hospital Course:
Pt returned to the ED s/p esophageal dilatation with chest pain
and SOB.  CT showed evidence of esophageal perforation. He was
paleced on broad spectrum emperic antibiotics -vanco, levo,
fluc, flagyl [**Date range (1) 97009**]/07. He was intubated and taken to the OR
where a 1 cm tear was found approx 33 cm down the esophagus.  At
this time there was a family meeting where they decided to not
go ahead with definitive repair and to make him DNR.  He was
taken to the SICU intubated and on pressors.  Pressors were
weaned off and he extubated without difficulty.  On [**12-16**] he had
R sided u/s guided R pleural drainage yielding 900 cc of fluid.
The next day he had the same done on the L side with 850 of
drainage.  On [**12-20**] he had a laparotomy with G and J tube
placement.  He also had respiratory difficulties on the floor
which may been due to narcotic pain med administered which
warranted a transfer to the CSRU. Pt recovered w/ narcan and non
invasive resp support. On [**12-21**] the R pigtail was d/c'd and on [**12-23**]
the L pigtail was d/c'd without complications.  On [**12-23**] he was in
good condition for transfered back to the floor. He completed
his antibiotic course and has remianed afebrile.  He is working
w/PT but remains deconditioned and requires ongoing rehab. His
tube feeds were advanced to goal.
