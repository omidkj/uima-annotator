Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 6195**]
Chief Complaint:
79y/o M with COPD on home O2, h/o lung cancer, presented again
after 2 recent admissions with a fever and shortness of breath.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
intravenous antibiotics


History of Present Illness:
Pt was recently diagnosed with an H flu pneumonia at the VA in
[**12-19**], and was intubated during that hospitalization.  He then
presented 2 days after discharge to [**Hospital1 18**] with similar
complaints, and was treated for pneumonia and a COPD
exacerbation.  On the day of admission, pt was at his nursing
home and was complaining of SOB.  Pt without complaint.  Feels
weak, but denies shortness of breath, chest pain, fevers,
chills, pain, or discomfort.  Of note, pt is a poor historian
with many responses being, "I don't know" when asked about
symptomatology.

In the [**Name (NI) **], pt with a fib with rapid ventricular response to 160;
BP 80s/30s.  Was treated with a bolus, 10mg IV diltiazem with
good effect.  Also received ceftaz, vanco, solumedrol, and 2L
IVF.  Sats were 100% on 2L.  PICC line found to be infiltrated
and was removed, with the tip sent for culture.  ABG revealed
7.38/55/91.  Pt did not tolerate BiPAP.


Past Medical History:
1. Recent hospitalization at the VA for pneumonia with
intubation for H. flu pneumonia (grew in sputum culture) treated
with Ceftazidime, Flagyl and Vancomycin

Brief Hospital Course:
1.  COPD flare - this was thought to be the etiology of pt's
acute on chronic hypercarbic respiratory failure.  Pt was
started on solumedrol 80mg IV q8h and placed on standing
albuterol/atrovent nebs.  As pt seemed to improve clinically,
with good oxygen saturation with 1-2L O2 by nasal cannula
(usually 97-100% O2 sat on 1L NC), a taper of the steroids was
begun.  On the day of discharge, pt was receiving a 40mg IV q8h
dose; we recommend he begin 20mg IV q8h on [**2-14**], for 2 days,
and then discontinue the steroids.

2.  pneumonia - On admission, pt was on day [**1-28**] of broad
spectrum antibiotics (ceftazidime, Flagyl, and vancomycin), with
H flu the only reported organism growing from sputum cultures at
the VA (never here).  However, the PICC line was infiltrated and
it was thought that he may not have received his antibiotics.
The PICC line was pulled, and the tip sent for culture, which
revealed coag negative Staph that was oxacillin resistant.  This
was thought to be likely due to a contaminant, as there were
greater than 15 colonies, no bacteremia, and no leukocytosis.  A
Legionella urinary antigen was sent, which was negative.  Pt's
CXR remained unchanged.

3.  atrial fibrillation - On the day of admission, pt devleloped
a new onset atrial fibrillation with RVR and hypotension.  Pt
had good response to IVF and IV diltiazem.  Cardiac enzymes were
sent, which revealed an elevated troponin thought to be most
likely due to demand ischemia in setting of rapid a fib.
Cardiology was consulted.  Due to the risk of aortic dissection
with an aortic thrombus associated with some ulceration into the
aortic wall, it was decided not to anticoagulate pt for a fib.
In addition, it was noted that pt does not meet CHADS2 criteria
for anticoagulation.  Pt was rate controlled, first with
metoprolol, but was then changed to verapamil in the setting of
severe lung disease.  Pt was monitored on telemetry, and
verapamil was uptitrated as needed to maintain good rate
control.

4.  fever - Pt was afebrile after the first 1-2 days of
admission.  Sources were likely pneumonia, which may not have
been adequately treated due to PICC infiltration.  PICC
infection was another possibility, though the PICC was removed
and cultures showed coag negative Staph.  Possible
thrombophlebitis prompted a L upper extremity ultrasound, which
did not show any evidence of DVT.

5.  aortic thrombus - Pt has an aortic thrombus, which is
somewhat ulcerated.  In this setting, pt was not anticoagulated
for atrial fibrillation.  It was recommended that pt get a
repeat chest CT in one month, and if there is evidence of
progression, he may need to follow up with cardiothoracic
surgery as an outpatient for further management decisions.  This
has been scheduled for [**2194-3-17**].

6.  left cephalic vein thrombosis - Pt's arm was noted to be
somewhat swollen, though this was initially thought to be due to
PICC infiltration.  However, the family was concerned about an
upper extremity DVT.  Another ultrasound, performed 3
