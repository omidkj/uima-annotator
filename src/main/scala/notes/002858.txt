Ms. [**Known lastname 26172**] is a 63 yo female with no significant past medical
history who presents following acute onset of chest pain and
shortness of breath at 1 a.m. following a fight with her sister.
 She states that she initially developed chest pressure that did
not radiate, followed by shortness of breath.  She became
lightheaded and states that she felt as though she was going to
pass out.  She vomited multiple times.  EMS was called and she
took ASA 324 mg as instructed.  Per EMS report, she was hypoxic
and tachycardic.
.
On arrival to ED, BP 140/90, HR 110, spO2 89% on 100% NRB, RR
89.  She was placed on NIPPV 10/5/100% and immediately had one
episode of vomiting, requiring suctioning, but reportedly no
aspiration.  She received Zofran 4 mg IV and CPAP mask was
replaced. A nitro gtt initiated with symptomatic improvement,
then weaned to off.  A foley was placed and 20 mg IV lasix was
given with ~1.2 liters UOP in response.  With finding of
pulmonary edema on CXR and positive troponin (1.10), she
received Plavix 600 mg PO and was started on integrillin and
heparin drips given concern for cardiac ischemia.  She
subsequently became transiently bradycardic with HR 40, BP 50/p
and a dopamine drip was started.  BP improved to 88/57.  Patient
was transferred directly to cath lab.
.
In the cath lab, patient was found to have clean coronaries and
high biventricular filling pressures; no intervention was
performed.  ABG was performed 7.31/42/54, and NIPPV was resumed
prior to transfer to CCU.
.
On review of symptoms, she denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. She denies recent fevers, chills or
rigors. She denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the
other review of systems were negative.  Patient denies any
recent tick bites or rashes.
.
Patient reports two episodes of transient left sided chest
pressure this past weekend, which lasted 5 minutes and occurred
while lying in bed.  She has had some mild shortness of breath
with exertion for the past two weeks.  Cardiac review of systems
is notable for absence of paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea,
orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, or syncope.


Past Medical History:
Multinodular goiter
s/p recent concussion

Social History:
Social history is significant for the absence of current tobacco
use.  Patient smoked 1.5 PPD until [**2122**]. There is no history of
alcohol abuse. She states that she drinks only one glass of wine

recent visit to [**Hospital3 **].  She currently resides with her
sister.  She states that she feels safe at home, but states that
she has asked her sister to move out.

Family History:
She states that her paternal grandfather had an MI in his 70's.
Her brother died of a sudden MI at the age of 67.  Sister has
bipolar disorder.

Brief Hospital Course:
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN, TO BE REVIEWED AND DISCUSSED IN
MULTIDISCIPLINARY ROUNDS:
Ms. [**Known lastname 26172**] is a 63 yo female with no significant past medical
history who presents with pulmonary edema in the setting of
new-onset cardiomyopathy
.
# Pump:  Patient presents with pulmonary edema, found to have a
cardiomyopathy with EF 20%, with no evidence of active ischemia.
 Development of cardiomyopathy follows acute stressful event in
this middle-aged female, supporting possible diagnosis of
Takotsubo's cardiomyopathy.  This diagnosis is also supported by
characteristic left ventricular apical ballooning.  Other
possible etiologies of cardiomyopathy include thyroid
dysfunction in this patient with h/o goiter vs. lyme myocarditis
given recent travel to [**Hospital3 **].  History does not support
alcoholic cardiomyopathy vs. other drug-induced cardiomyopathy.
- wean dopamine as able, maintaining MAP>65
- initiate AceI and beta-blocker once BP able to tolerate
- aggressive diuresis as tolerated by BP and renal function
- check lyme serology
- check TSH
- Social work consult
Pt was closely observed during her hospitalization, ambulation
was gradually increased, and she was ultimately discharged in
stable condition.
.
# CAD/Ischemia:  Patient with no evidence of CAD on cardiac
catheterization.
- continue ASA daily
- d/c Plavix
.
# FEN:
- Goal I/O: 2 liters negative.
- Replete K>4, Mg>2
- Low sodium diabetic diet
.
# Prophylaxis:

# Code status:  Full code, confirmed with patient at time of
admission to CCU.

Medications on Admission:
None

Discharge Disposition:
Home

Discharge Diagnosis:
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy
Myocardial Infarction
Heart Failure, Acute Systolic
Thyroid Nodule

Discharge Condition:
Stable

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted for shortness of breath with associated chest
pain.  After being admitted to the hospital, you had a procedure
done on your heart to determine the anatomy and pressures in
your heart called a cardiac catheterization.  During the
procedure, it was found that the apex of your heart was bigger
than it should be.  As a result, a diagnosis of takotsubo
cardiomyopathy was made, which is a condition in which you can
go into congestive heart failure and have acute changes in the
anatomy of your heart based on acute changes in emotion or
anxiety.  You were given medications to remove fluid from your
lungs (which you will be started on at home) and medications to
control your heart.  You have an appointment with a cardiologist
(Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and one that you must make with your primary care
provider.  [**Name10 (NameIs) **] you experience any acute shortness of breath,
cough up pink tinged sputum, chest pain, loss of consciousness,
or extreme lightheadedness/dizziness, please call your primary
care physician [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 608**].
