Cardiac catheterization


History of Present Illness:
This is a 65 yo M who is 5 weeks s/p tricuspid valve replacement
for severe nonischemic cardiomyopathy with h/o [**Hospital1 **]-V IVCD (lead
causing wide open TR) and chronic afib on coumadin, who p/w one
day history of worsening DOE and orthopnea. Pt has noted DOE
with walking since his operation on [**2156-11-28**]. Three days ago his
DOE increased. Two nights ago, he noted increased orthopnea and
had 2 episodes of PND. He saw his cardiologist, Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 437**], for
f/u yesterday, at which point he had no complaints. After the
appointment he noted increased DOE, occurring after a few steps.
All of these were acute changes from the past few weeks. No
appreciable increase in edema. Denies prior PND. Denies CP. Has
had nonproductive cough since leaving hospital on [**12-29**] for
constipation. No f/c. No n/v/d. Came in today because of acute
change in symptoms.
.
On [**Hospital1 1516**] this AM, pt received 100mg IV lasix.  Went for RHC after
which swan was placed.  Now being admitted to CCU for milrinone
+/- lasix gtt for fluid management.
.
On arrival to CCU, pt was comfortable without complaints.

Past Medical History:
s/p Tricuspid valve replacement for TR
s/p biventricular pacer/ICD placement [**2155-8-10**]
s/p removal of pacer/ICD
s/p Left achilles tendon repair
s/p Sinus Surgery
chronic atrial fibrillation
nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy
chronic dysphagia

Social History:
Retired pipe fitter. Lives with wife [**Name (NI) **] in [**Name (NI) 392**]. Never
smoked. Denies illicits. Drank EtOH only rarely after diagnosed
with CHF; quit in [**2156-4-9**].

Family History:
Mother with renal failure. No family history of early MI,
arrhythmia, cardiomyopathies, or sudden cardiac death; otherwise
non-contributory.

PERTINENT STUDIES
CXR [**2157-1-5**]
FINDINGS: Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.
The patient is status post median sternotomy. There are small
bilateral pleural effusions with overlying atelectasis. No overt
pulmonary edema is seen. The cardiac silhouette remains top
normal to mildly enlarged.
IMPRESSION: Small bilateral pleural effusions with overlying
atelectasis.
.
CARDIAC CATH [**2157-1-6**]
COMMENTS:
1. Resting hemodynamics revealed right and left filling
pressures with
RVEDP of 20 mmHg and PCW 27 mmHg. There was moderate pulmonary
artery
systoic hypertension with PASP of 53 mmHg. The cardiac index was
low at
1.9 L/min/m2.
.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Biventricular elevated filling pressures.
2. Moderate pulmonary arterial hypertension.
.
ECHO [**2157-1-6**]
Conclusions
The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or
color Doppler. The estimated right atrial pressure is at least
15 mmHg. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. The left ventricular cavity
is dilated. Systolic function of apical segments is relatively
preserved. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
severely depressed (LVEF= 15%). [Intrinsic left ventricular
systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of
valvular regurgitation.] The right ventricular free wall
thickness is normal. The right ventricular cavity is mildly
dilated with moderate global free wall hypokinesis. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is
not present. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are structurally normal. Moderate to severe (3+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. A bioprosthetic tricuspid valve is
present. The tricuspid prosthesis appears well seated, with
normal leaflet motion and transvalvular gradients. [Due to
acoustic shadowing, the severity of tricuspid regurgitation may
be significantly UNDERestimated.] There is mild pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is a trivial/physiologic
pericardial effusion.
.
IMPRESSION: Biatrial enlargement. Dilated, severely hypokinetic
left ventricle with relative preservation of the apical
segments. Dilated, hypokinetic right ventricle. Mild aortic
regurgitation. Moderate to severe mitral regurgitation.
Well-seated, normally functioning tricuspid annuloplasty ring.
Mild pulmonary artery systolic pressure.
.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2156-12-20**],
there is worsening left ventricular global and regional systolic
function with a decrease in ejection fraction from 25% to 15%.
The severity of mitral regurgitation has increased minimally.
Mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension is now appreciated;
its presence could not be determined previously.

[**2157-1-11**] TTE:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are
normal. The left ventricular cavity size is top
normal/borderline dilated. There is severe global left
ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 25 %). The right ventricular
free wall thickness is normal. The right ventricular cavity is
mildly dilated with depressed free wall contractility. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no
mitral valve prolapse. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. A bioprosthetic tricuspid valve is present. The tricuspid
prosthesis appears well seated, with normal leaflet motion and
transvalvular gradients.

Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed)
of [**2157-1-6**], systolic function of both ventricles is
improved.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 85439**] is a 65-year-old-man who is five weeks status post
tricuspid valve replacement for severe tricuspid regurgitation,
severe right ventricular enlargement, and severe right heart
failure, with recent removal of defibrillator coil that revealed
a massively dilated right atrium and right ventricle who is
presenting with worsening dyspnea on exertion.
