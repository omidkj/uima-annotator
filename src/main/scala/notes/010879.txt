Brief Hospital Course:
79 yo M NHR w/ hx CVA, chronic aspiration, UTI, dementia, CAD
a/w hemoptysis, descending aortic pseudoaneurism and fever.
.
# HEMOPTYSIS - 2x/12h of ~ [**11-26**] cup of hemoptysis. Given his
pseudoaneurism, worry about erosion into bronchus, however pt
evaluated by CT surgery who feel that pt is too high risk for
OR. Additionally, pt could have another etiology for hemoptysis
as more bleeding would be expected from an aortopulmonary
fistula. The differential diagnosis is long esp bronchiectasis
in this pt w/ hx of recurrent asp pna, TB (given his NHR
status), PE, bronchitis, pulm AVM, bronchogenic ca (chronic
retrocardiac opacity concerning for post-obstructive lung
collapse), and pna. He is HD stable w/ good resp status and
would not intubate at this time. Should he hemoptysize more, he
should lie on the abnormal lung (likely L lung given CXR) in the
Left lateral decubitus position w/ plans for intubation to
protect the good lung. Hct 38---31 at 1:00pm
- appreciate CT surgery input
- admit to ICU for BP control and closer monitoring
- plan for bronchoscopy to evaluate site of bleeding
- epistaxis not completely ruled out as a cause for "hemoptysis"

- plant PPD: not coughing
- con't levo for h/o quinolone sensitive UTI
- con't hold anticoagulants
- BP control - hold antihypertensives for BP <130 given worry
re: bleeding
- s/p T&Cross, 2PIV's
.
# FEVER - likely UTI given prior + Urine cultures for
hightly-resistent pseudomonas (was only sensitive to
[**Month/Day (2) **]/Gent/[**Last Name (un) **]. Finished 2 week course of Levo 250 during last
admission)Was finishing course of Augmentin and Bactrium for
"UTI"
-Try to get cultre data at NH for this UTI
- c/w Levo renal dosed. Await culture data.
- f/u BCx x2, UCx, check sputum Cx
-CT of chest without postobstructive PNA. levo should cover
atypicals. Will add Vanc if fever/leukocytosis returns and
zosyn.
.
#Hypertension (and relaive Hypotension): On HCTZ/Lisinopril as
outpatient: Currently, relatively hypotensive as c/w baseline.
-Lopressor 5mg IV q6 (for only BP >160)
-Hold standing antihypertensive agents given hemorrage risk
-Lactate normal:
.
Dementia: Has h/o of "atypical psycosis" only on Zoloft 50 qd.
-Haldol 1 mg prn
.
Asthma: C/W PRN Ipr/Albuterol
.
# Contact - wife [**Telephone/Fax (1) 27297**];
#[**Name2 (NI) **]s: Has Right hand 14 guage and 16 guage.
#FEN/GI: IVF/Blood/Lytes/PPI/NPO for likely bronch
#Prophylaxis:  Bowel reg. Pneumoboots/ Hold SQ Hep given risk
for Bleed.
# Code - full per discussion by PCP coverage [**Name9 (PRE) **] attending
(Dr.[**Last Name (STitle) **],[**First Name3 (LF) **]) and ED Sr. Resident (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **]).

Overnight: Patient received 1 u PRBC with stable HCT checks. No
further episodes of hemoptysis and remained hemodynamically
stable overnight. Given his presentation, lack of further HCT
decline or bleeding, and stable CT scan of aorta, felt that
hemoptysis was best explained by tongue [**Last Name (un) 20694**] event or
epitaxis and not herald bleed of a bronchial-aortic fistula.
Given his poor functional status and proceedureal risk,
bronchoscopy was defered. Patient remains full code at this
time, but code status should be continued to be addessed in
light of his aneurysm.
