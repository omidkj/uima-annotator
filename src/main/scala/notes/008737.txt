Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1267**]
Chief Complaint:
History of mitral valve prolapse

[**2127-5-6**] - Cardiac Catheterization

History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 38-year-old man who presents with increasing
shortness of breath and ventricular dysfunction. He has known
severe mitral regurgitation.
Catheterization showed normal ejection fraction and normal
coronary arteries but a reduced effective forward ejection
fraction.  It was elected to proceed with mitral valve repair
replacement.

[**2127-5-9**] CXR
Small bilateral pleural effusions. Increased basilar opacities,
consistent with atelectasis, less likely a pneumonia.

[**2127-5-6**] Cardiac Cath
1. Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system
revealed
no evidence of obstructive coronary artery disease.  The left
main
coronary artery is without angiographic evidence of obstructive
coronary
artery disease.  The left anterior descending coronary artery is
without
angiographic evidence of obstructive coronary artery disease in
the
proximal, mid, or distal LAD.  The left circumflex coronary
artery is
without angiographic evidence of obstructive coronary artery
disease in
the proximal, mid, or distal vessel.  The right coronary artery
is the
dominant vessel.  There is no angiographic evidence of
obstructive
coronary artery disease in the proximal, mid, or distal RCA.
2. Left ventriculography revealed normal left ventricular
systolic
function.  Contrast calculated LVEF = 60%.  There was 4+ mitral
regurgitation.
3. Right heart catheterization revealed normal right and left
sided
filling pressures.

[**2127-5-6**] ECHO
Pre Bypass:
1. The left atrium is moderately dilated. No atrial septal
defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or
saline contrast with maneuvers.
2. The coronary sinus is large, but injection of agitated saline
in the left arm supports normal drainage pattern (no suggestion
of presistent left svc).
3. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity size is top normal/borderline dilated.
Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more
depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
4. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal.
5.There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch and the
descending thoracic aorta.
6.The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with
good leaflet excursion. There is no aortic valve stenosis. Trace
aortic regurgitation is seen.
7.The mitral valve leaflets are moderately thickened. The mitral
valve
leaflets are myxomatous. The mitral valve leaflets are
elongated. There is
severe mitral valve prolapse of the posterior leaflet. There is
mitral anular calcification. Also noted is heavy calcification
of a portion of the cordae attaching to the posterior leaflet.
The [**Doctor Last Name **]/PL ratio is > 1 and the Csept distance measures 2.7 cm.
8. There is no pericardial effusion.

POST -BYPASS: Pt is receiving an infusion of phenylephrine
1. No mitral valve prolapse is seen. Mitral ring appears to be
in good
position. No MR is detected. The posterior leaflet has been
extensively
resected. The leaflets are co-apting well.
2. Aorta and interatrial septum are intact
3. Other findings are unchanged


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 31385**] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2127-5-6**] for a cardiac
catheterization and elective surgical management of his mitral
valve prolapse. His cardiac catheterization revealed normal
coronary arteries, 4+ mitral regurgitation and a left
ventricular ejection fraction of 60%. Mr. [**Known lastname 31385**] was worked-up
in the usual preoperative manner and found to be ready for
surgery. On [**2127-5-7**], Mr. [**Known lastname 31385**] was taken to the operating
room where he underwent a mitral valve repair utilizing a 29mm
duran ancore band. Please se operative note for specific
details. Postoperatively he was taken to the cardiac surgical
intensive care unit for monitoring. By postoperative day one,
Mr. [**Known lastname 31385**] was awake, extubated and neurologically intact. He
was then transferred to the cardiac surgical step down unit for
further recovery. He was gently diuresed towards his
preoperative weight. The physical therapy service was consulted
for assistance with his postoperative strength and mobility.
Beta blockade, aspirin and a statin were resumed. Mr. [**Known lastname 31385**]
continued to make steady progress and was discharged home on
postoperative day three. He will follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], his
cardiologist and his primary care physician as an outpatient. On
discharge, his wound was clean, dry and intact and his vital
signs were stable.
