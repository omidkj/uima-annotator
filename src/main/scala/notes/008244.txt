CHIEF COMPLAINT:   The patient presented with shortness of
breath.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a [**Age over 90 **] year old female
with a history of pulmonary disease, history of atrial
fibrillation, congestive heart failure, and diastolic
dysfunction, admitted with shortness of breath times two to
three weeks.  By report, the patient initially had a viral
upper respiratory illness late in [**Month (only) 958**] with a nonproductive
cough.  She had some congestion and intermittent shortness of
breath.  She saw Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] two weeks ago.  He gave her a
chest x-ray significant for blunting of left costophrenic
angle without consolidations.  Over the last two weeks, she
had progressive shortness of breath; usually sleeps with two
pillows, now sleeping in a chair.

The patient reports some paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea but
unclear history, cough which is nonproductive.  No fever or
chills, nausea or vomiting, abdominal pain, no change in
bowel habits.  She has bilateral peripheral edema, maybe
slightly increased lately per her report.  She reports that
she may have eaten increased salt over the last couple of
weeks.  The patient has had no weight change, no chest pain.
She says she has been somewhat lethargic over the past couple
of weeks, decreased activity.

At baseline, the patient can walk on flat ground without
incident [**Last Name **] problem.  [**Name (NI) **] issues with climbing stairs and can
do activities of daily living.  In the Emergency Department,
the patient's EKG is unchanged from previous, initially
brought in at 74% on room air O2 saturation with an arterial
blood gas of pH of 7.23, CO2 80, and pO2 41.  Her O2
saturation increased to 93% on four liters nonrebreather.
She was talking in full sentences, in no acute distress.
Chest x-ray was consistent with congestive heart failure.

Upon admission to the Emergency Department, the patient had a
low grade temperature of 99.1 F., a white blood cell count of
5.0.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  History of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, ?
pulmonary disease.  No pulmonary function tests on record.
2.  Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.
3.  Congestive heart failure:  She had an echocardiogram of
[**6-/2108**], which showed moderately dilated left atrium,
moderately dilated right atrium, positive ASD, left
ventricular hypertrophy, ejection fraction of greater than
55%.
4.  Myopathy, ? involving the diaphragm.
5.  History of angina.
6.  Graves' Disease status post radio-ablation and
replacement therapy.
7.  Right breast cancer status post XRT.

MEDICATIONS:
1.  Coumadin 2.5 mg q. day.
2.  Synthroid 0.1 q. day and 0.2 on Sundays.
3.  Nephron A drops.
4.  Lasix 20 mg every other day.
5.  Potassium 10 mEq on Wednesdays.
6.  Diltiazem 30 mg twice a day.

8.  Isosorbide 20 mg three times a day.
9.  Aspirin 81 mg once a day.
10. Nitroglycerin sublingual as needed.
11. Colace 100 mg twice a day.
12. Multivitamin.

ALLERGIES:   No known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient was a heavy smoker, two packs a
day times greater than 60 years; quit four years ago.  No
alcohol use.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission, temperature 99.1 F.;
blood pressure 140/79; heart rate 83; 70% on room air, up to
92% on four liters non-rebreather.  The patient did not do
well on nasal cannula due to mouth breathing.  In general,
elderly female, looks much younger than stated age, speaking
in full sentences, in no acute distress.  HEENT showed
normocephalic, atraumatic, extraocular muscles are intact.
Dry mucous membranes.  Chest:  Positive rales bilaterally,
left half way up; right one third up.  Positive jugular
venous distention to 9 cm.  Heart:  Irregular, distant heart
sounds.  No murmurs, rubs or gallops.  Abdomen obese, well
healed midline surgical scar; soft, nontender.  Extremities:
Three plus bilateral edema.  No asymmetry.  Neurologic
examination normal.

LABORATORY:  On admission, white blood cell count 5.2,
hematocrit 37.8, platelets 214.  Sodium 140, potassium 5.3,
chloride 100, bicarbonate 33, BUN 29, creatinine 1.0, glucose
110.  CK pending.

Chest x-ray with bilateral small effusions with blunting of
costophrenic angle bilaterally.  Cannot rule out underlying
infection.

EKG is normal sinus rhythm at 84, left axis deviation, first
degree AV block.  No acute ST changes with premature atrial
contractions, plus/minus ectopic atrial beats.

Arterial blood gas on admission 7.28/80/41.  INR of 3.8.

Urinalysis with small amount of blood.

Glucose 126, lactate 1.2.

ASSESSMENT & PLAN:  [**Age over 90 **] year old female with chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease, no pulmonary function tests on
record, and history of congestive heart failure admitted for
shortness of breath, no chest pain, mild cough.  In the
Emergency Department 74% on room air increased to 93% on five
liters non-rebreather.  Was given Lasix 40 mg intravenously
in Emergency Department.  Chest x-ray consistent with
congestive heart failure; difficult to rule out infiltrate.
Etiology of congestive heart failure is questionable
diastolic dysfunction implicated in past.  Last
echocardiogram with normal ejection fraction; on Lasix at
home every other day.  Dietary indiscretion could be at
fault; possible ischemia.

PLAN:
1.  Congestive heart failure:  Lasix 40 mg intravenously in
the Emergency Department; titrate to negative urine output of
1.5 liters over 24 hours; rule out myocardial infarction; get
serial enzymes and check EKG in the morning.  Continue Lasix
for diuresis; continue other cardiac medications including
aspirin and Coumadin for atrial fibrillation, sublingual
Nitroglycerin, Isosorbide, Procardia, Diltiazem, monitor
daily weights, intakes and outputs.

2.  Question of infection:  Clinically seems less likely; no
sputum production.  Chest x-ray consistent with failure.
Temperature afebrile.  The patient given a dose of Levaquin
250 mg in the Emergency Department; possible viral infection.

3.  Endocrine:  Continue Synthroid.  Last TSH was 4.4 a year
ago.

4.  Fluids, Electrolytes and Nutrition:  Replete electrolytes
as needed.  Monitor potassium 5.3, on a Chem-7.  No peaked T
waves.  EKG with no changes.  Hold intravenous fluid;
decrease NA in diet.

5.  Prophylaxis:  Coumadin p.o. intake.

6.  Full Code.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  Pulmonary:  The patient continued to improve somewhat.
The patient was seen by Pulmonary consultation.  Pulmonary
function tests were done although were suboptimal due to the
exacerbation.  Pulmonary function tests showed a restrictive
picture with a FEV1/FEC ratio of 94%; TLC 69% predicted; RV
96% predicted with FEC 37% predicted, showing a restrictive
picture, less likely obstructive picture.

The patient continued to utilize oxygen three to four liters
nasal cannula, keeping oxygen saturations 90 to 92% due to
her CO2 retention.  The patient probably has decreased
respiratory drive, chronic decreased pO2 and increased pCO2
due to obesity.  Question of myopathy.  The patient had a
sleep study and results are pending and being analyzed.  The
patient was tried on BiPAP overnight.  Suspect that BiPAP
will help greatly with hypoxia and hypercarbia during
sleeping.  The patient did not like using the BiPAP and
refused to use.  Our request would be to use BiPAP at night
for sleep apnea and trouble breathing due to obesity and
possible myopathy.

The patient will be continued on Levaquin for seven days
total; today is day six on discharge.  She will need one more
day of Levaquin.  The patient will need pulmonary function
tests including diffusion capacities, once she is back to
baseline.  The patient will receive Albuterol nebulizers only
p.r.n.  The patient did have no wheeze or obstructive type
symptoms.  The patient will be followed up by Pulmonary as an
outpatient.

2.  Cardiovascular:  The patient had an echocardiogram which
showed left ventricular function greater than 55%, left
atrium moderately dilated, dilated right ventricle with
decreased right ventricular systolic function.  Compared with
echocardiogram from [**2108-7-2**], ASD was not
