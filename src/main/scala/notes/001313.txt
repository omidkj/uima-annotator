Brief Hospital Course:
This was a [**Age over 90 **] yo woman with six day history of cephalosporin tx
for a UTI, who presented with fulminant diarrhea, vomiting, and
increasing lethargy. She also soon developed hypotension. She
was intubated for airway protection and received pressors and
fluids to maintain pressure. Cultures were sent. We changed the
code status to DNR based on medical futility, d/w son (health
care proxy) who agreed. However, her son felt that we should
continue maximal care otherwise.
.
Notable features of her course include an increasingly distended
abdomen and, initially, unresponsiveness without sedation. Her
abdomen was visualized via KUB and showed large air collections,
although the radiologist was unable to determine with certainty
whether this was inside or outside the bowel. She was not stable
enough to go to CT for further evaluation. Additionally she was
not an appropriate surgical candidate because of her continued
instability.
.
C. diff toxin was positive x2. Blood, stool and urine cultures
were otherwise all negative. She was treated with PO
metronidazole, PO vancomycin and IV vancomycin. Vancomycin
troughs were monitored and were supratherapeutic even on PO
vanco alone. We continued with PO metronidazole and PO
vancomycin, accounting for reduced clearance.
.
Over the first several days of her admission she improved
clinically somewhat. She was soon able to respond with head nods
and shakes to questions; and could move hands and feet on
request. She was significantly overbreathing her ventilator, and
eventually was weaned off assist control and put on pressure
support. However, her abdomen continued to be distended and
tympanic. She stopped putting out stool. Her pressures did not
continue to improve. She then became less interactive. She
became more hypotensive and was given multiple fluid boluses and
was put back on levophed. She had an ovoid pupil and was
minimally interactive on the morning of the 3rd, and her
condition continued to worsen. By the end of her admission she
was more than 30 liters net positive, but this did not stop her
hypotension. In the evening she begin to have increasing
arrhythmias; and her pressures dropped into systolics in the 30s
in the first hours of [**2109-8-19**]. After discussion with her son,
there was agreement that the goals of care should change; she
was extubated, and she expired.
