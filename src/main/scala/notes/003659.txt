HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 45-year-old male with
no previously diagnosed coronary artery disease, who is
transferred to [**Hospital1 69**] from [**Hospital3 418**] Hospital status post acute ST elevation MI.  The
patient was woken up from sleep early the morning of
admission by [**9-19**] sharp, substernal bilateral chest pain,
which was associated with dyspnea, diaphoresis, and possible
palpitations.  The patient denies any associated nausea or
vomiting.  The chest pain was nonpleuritic and aside from
mild right forearm tingling, did not radiate.

At the outside hospital, the EKG showed ST elevations greater
than 3 mm at I, aVL, V1 through V5, peaked T's anteriorly, ST
depressions inferiorly, poor R-wave progression.  This first
set of CK and troponin-I were normal.  Patient was treated
with Heparin, nitroglycerin, aspirin, Lopressor and was
transferred here for emergent cardiac catheterization, which
revealed an 80 percent stenosis of the mid RCA, 100 percent
proximal LAD stenosis, 80 percent proximal left circumflex,
and 99 percent stenosis of the OM-1.  The left ventricular
end diastolic pressure was 31 mm Hg.  The LAD was stented and
intra-aortic balloon pump was placed, and the patient was
enrolled in the Coil MI2 clinical trial.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Low back pain.
2. No known diabetes, no known hypertension, no known high
   cholesterol.


CURRENT MEDICATIONS ON TRANSFER:
1. Enteric coated aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d.
2. Plavix 75 p.o. q.d.
3. Heparin IV drip.
4. Meperidine 25 mg IV prn shivering.
5. Integrelin drip.


FAMILY HISTORY:  Father:  History of CVA at age 72.  Mother
passed away at age 62 from lung cancer.  Patient has three
brothers and one sister with no known history of heart
disease.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient works as a roofer.  He is
married and has three children.  He had a one pack per day
smoking history x25 years.  He has a history of drinking
beer, however, he states that he currently only drinks
approximately [**3-14**] glasses of wine every two weeks or so.
There is no history of illicit drug use or cocaine use.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS ON TRANSFER TO [**Hospital1 18**]:  Negative for chest
pain, dyspnea, or diaphoresis.  He had no constitutional
symptoms.  He was breathing comfortably.  He denied a history
of syncope or presyncope.  He had no known PND, orthopnea, or
dyspnea on exertion.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  His temperature was 36.5
C, heart rate 60-84, blood pressure 110-122/90-98,
respiratory rate 10-12, and oxygen saturation 100 percent on
room air.  General:  He is awake in bed in no apparent
distress.  He is calm and comfortable.  HEENT:
Normocephalic, atraumatic, sclerae are anicteric, pupils are
equal, round, and reactive to light and accommodation.
Extraocular motions intact bilaterally.  Mucous membranes
were moist.  His oropharynx was clear.  His neck was supple.
He had 2 plus carotids bilaterally without bruits.  His
jugular venous pressure was approximately 7 cm up 45 degrees.
Cardiovascular exam was regular, rate, and rhythm, normal S1,
S2, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops.  Chest was clear to
auscultation bilaterally with good aeration.  Abdomen was
obese, soft, nontender, nondistended, normoactive bowel
sounds, no hepatosplenomegaly, no palpable pulsatile masses.
Extremities are warm and dry without clubbing, cyanosis, or
edema.  He had 2 plus pedal pulses bilaterally.  On his skin,
a tattoo on the right upper extremity, no rashes.
Neurological exam:  Alert and oriented times three, speech
normal.  Cranial nerves II through XII are grossly intact
bilaterally.  Had a sheath in the right and left groin
without hematoma and palpable distal dorsalis pedis pulses
bilaterally.

His EKG on [**2147-6-26**] at 11:02 a.m. showed sinus rhythm at 72
beats per minute, poor baseline artifact, anterior ST
elevations less pronounced, approximately 1.5 to 2 mm.

The patient underwent cardiac catheterization, which showed a
normal left main coronary artery, proximally occluded LAD, a
proximal 80 percent tubular lesion on the left circumflex.

LABORATORIES ON ADMISSION:  CK of 5109 with a CK MB of 490.
In addition, the patient had a normal Chem-7 with a
creatinine of 1.0 at the outside hospital with an initial CPK
of 116 and MB 1.0, troponin-I of less than 0.05 at [**Hospital3 418**] Hospital.  He had a normal hematocrit and platelet
count prior to catheterization.

BRIEF HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. ST elevation MI.  This 45-year-old gentleman with no known
   history of coronary artery disease, diabetes, high
   cholesterol, or hypertension was transferred to [**Hospital1 55251**] from [**Hospital3 417**] with a
   ST elevation MI.  On catheterization, he was noted to have
   multiple discrete lesions to the RCA, proximal LAD, and
   left circumflex.  The patient had a stent placed in the
   LAD, which was felt to be the culprit lesion.

Postcatheterization, the patient had an intra-aortic balloon
pump placed, and was transferred to the Coronary Intensive
Care Unit for ICU monitoring.  The patient was continued on
Heparin drip as well as Integrelin for 18 hours
postcatheterization.  He was also continued on aspirin and
Plavix.  His intra-aortic balloon pump was weaned slowly.
There was discussion regarding whether the most appropriate
course of care would be to perform a CABG or to repeat
catheterization with stenting of the other lesions in the RCA
and the left circumflex.

Given that these lesions appeared to be discrete rather than
long tubular lesions, a decision was made that repeat
catheterization would be a favorable choice in this patient.
The patient underwent repeat cardiac catheterization on
[**2147-6-29**] with a stent to the RCA and the circumflex.  The
patient tolerated this procedure well without any events.
The patient was transferred to the General Cardiology floor
following catheterization.  He did not experience any chest
pain, shortness of breath postprocedure.  He did have some
mild right groin pain.  He did not develop any significant
hematomas or bleeding from his catheterization site.

Postcatheterization, the patient did have three beats of
NSVT.  EP was consulted, and felt that given patient has had
a recent large anterior myocardial infarction with three
vessel intervention, that his three beats of NSVT was likely
secondary to reperfusion.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 284**] recommended that
the patient have an echocardiogram as well as a Holter
monitor prior to following up with her [**8-10**] at 12:30 p.m.
to help discuss possible electrophysiology study and possible
ICD placement if needed.

The patient was started on Lipitor 80 and Lopressor was
titrated up daily for cardioprotective effects.  In addition,
the patient was started on lisinopril.  In addition, the
patient was started on Coumadin given that his post-ST
elevation MI echocardiogram demonstrated the patient had a
depressed ejection fraction of 25 percent with severe left
ventricular systolic dysfunction and akinesis of the distal
[**3-14**] of the heart with evidence of mild aneurysm of the apex.
The patient was evaluated by Physical Therapy prior to
discharge, who felt the patient was safe to be discharged
home.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Stable, no further chest pain, or
nonsustained VT.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1. Anterolateral ST segment elevation myocardial infarction.
2. Congestive heart failure.
3. Left ventricular aneurysm.


MAJOR SURGICAL PROCEDURES:  Cardiac catheterization.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  To home.

DISCHARGE FOLLOW UP:  The patient is to followup with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **], his primary care physician to check his INR and
for Coumadin adjustment.  His primary care physician should
also refer the patient to cardiac rehab.  In addition, the
patient has follow up with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] in Cardiology on
[**8-10**] at 8 a.m.  He also has a follow-up appointment on
[**8-21**] with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 3692**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 284**] at 12:30.  Finally, he
has an appointment with the Ho
