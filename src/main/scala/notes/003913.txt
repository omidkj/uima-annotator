Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2297**]
Chief Complaint:
hypoxia / hypotension.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none.

History of Present Illness:
74 F with EtOH cirrhosis who presents from rehab with hypoxia
and hypotension. Pt recently dc'd from [**Hospital1 18**] on [**11-15**] after
hospitalization for ARF (creatinine incrased to 4.8), VRE UTI,
and cellulitis. During that admission she was diagnosed with
pulmonary hypertension. The work up was unrevealing for
etiology. She was started on diltiazem on discharge empirically
per pulmonary consult for her pulmonary hypertension.  Pt denies
any SOB, DOE, cough, F/C, dysuria, frequency. Pt feels well. She
does report some ? increased diarrhea with lactulose for which
the dose of her lactulose was halved recently. In [**Name (NI) **], pt
bradycardic to 30s. Noted to be hypotensive to 50s. Pt
resuscitated without effect with 3L NS. Throughout time in ED,
she was mentating and making urine. Pt also given Levoquin for
+UA.


Past Medical History:

(grade 1) and hepatic encephalopathy
2. a-fib. not anticoagulated
3. s/p meningitis with epidural abscess
4. BCC s/p MOHS excision
5. pseudogout
6. VRE UTI
7. Lower extremity edema
8. CRI, baseline cr 1.5-1.9 until recent admit [**10-24**]
9. Anemia of Chronic Inflammation
10. Chronic Thrombocytopenia
11. Pulmonary HTN / RV dysfunction

Social History:
Pt lived with her daughter in [**Name (NI) **]. She has not had alcohol
in [**3-23**] years. She continues to smoke [**1-21**] ppd.

Pertinent Results:
CXR: + increased interstitial markings. loss of L costaphrenic
angle. unchanged from [**2198-11-13**].
.
CXR ([**2198-11-26**]): An endotracheal tube has been withdrawn in the
interval and now terminates approximately 2 cm above the carina
with the neck in a flexed position. A left subclavian vascular
catheter remains in satisfactory position. Cardiac silhouette is
mildly enlarged. Previously reported minimal pulmonary edema has
resolved in the interval. Bilateral pleural effusions are again
demonstrated with improvement on the right and no significant
change on the left. Gastric distension appears decreased in the
interval with mild-to-moderate distention remaining.
.
EKG: nl axis. nl intervals. sinus brady. ST segment depression
in I, AVL unchanged from old EKG.
.
Renal U/S: The right kidney measures 9.8 cm, and the left kidney
measures 9.2 cm. There is no hydronephrosis. Nonobstructing
stones are present in both kidneys. There is an 11-mm stone in
the lower pole of the right kidney, which was previously seen on
[**2198-11-3**]. There is a 4-mm stone in the upper pole of the
left kidney. The bladder is decompressed by a Foley catheter. No
hydronephrosis. Bilateral nonobstructing renal stones.
.
echo ([**11-13**]): 1. The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial
septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color
Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers. 2. Left ventricular
wall thickness, cavity size, and systolic function are normal
(LVEF>55%). Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. 3.
The right ventricular cavity is dilated. Right ventricular
systolic function appears depressed. 4. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is
seen.
5. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. 6. Compared
with the findings of the prior study of [**2198-11-5**], there has been
no significant change.
.
echo ([**2198-11-26**]): The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%). The
right ventricular free wall is hypertrophied. The right
ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. Right ventricular
systolic function is normal. The aortic root is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is
seen. There is severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Significant pulmonic regurgitation is seen. The main pulmonary
artery is dilated. There is a trivial pericardial effusion.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs [**Known lastname **] initially presented with hypotension and bradycardia
in the setting of chronic liver failure and acute on chronic
renal failure.  The presenting symptoms of hypotension and
bradycardia were due to nodal toxicity caused by recently
started dilitazem plus chronic nadolol, worsened by renal
failure.  While she initially responded to treatment for beta
blocker toxicity, her hypotension was persistent, and
attributable to chronic vasodilatation with liver failure, and
severe right heart failure and low left ventricle filling in
context of severe pulmonary hypertension.  Her chronic renal
failure worsened, and the consulting renal team agreed with the
assessment that her renal failure was due to a combination of
hepato-renal syndrome and pre-renal azotemia in the context of
her low flow state.  No hemodialysis was pursed for the
worsening acidemia because of her hemodynamic instability.
Compounding her renal and liver failure, she developed
progressive respiratory distress and hypoxemia, for which she
was intubated and placed on assist control mechanical
ventilation.  Patient was confirmed to be DNR in conversation
with her daughter, and after being apprised of the poor
prognosis given multi-organ system failure, her daughter elected
for terminal extubation.  The patient was placed on a morphine
drip, extubated, and, after several hours with family and
friends, she died peacefully with her family and friends
present.
