yellow sputum. She denies F/C, N/V/D, sick contacts, recent
travel, LE swelling, CP. CT head showed no intracranial
hemorrhage. CXR showed no acute process. ABG was obtained and

HC03 of 33. She was started on BiPAP in the ED and admitted to
the ICU for further management of her hypercarbic respiratory
failure. Of note, patient was given a brief steroid taper on

azithromycin. In the ED she got azithro and Ceftriaxone. Her
hypercarbia improved on biPap and she was called out to the

patient cooperation.
2. Mental retardation
3. Bipolar disorder
4. Gastroesophageal reflux disease

Pertinent Results:
CXR ([**4-18**]): Low lung volumes limit evaluation. There is no
evidence of pneumonia or CHF. No pleural effusions or evidence
of pneumothorax is seen. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is
unremarkable. The visualized osseous structures appear intact.
IMPRESSION: No acute intrathoracic process.

<br>CT Head ([**4-18**]): Non-contrast head CT. Please note,
evaluation at the level of the skull base is somewhat limited
due to motion. There is no intra-axial or extra-axial
hemorrhage, mass effect, shift of normally midline structures,
or hydrocephalus. There is no evidence of major vascular
territorial infarction. Ventricles and sulci have a normal
appearance for this age. The calvarium is intact. Mucosal
thickening is noted within the ethmoid sinuses and minimally
within the sphenoid sinuses bilaterally. Bilateral mastoid air
cells as well as the middle ear cavities are well aerated. The
calvarium is intact.
IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial process.


Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 70 y.o. F with COPD, mental retardation, GERD who presents
s/p fall with hypercarbic respiratory failure likely secondary
to COPD exacerbation/Pneumonia
.
COPD exacerbation/hypercarbia/Community acquired PNA: The
patient was initially admitted to the ICU, and her hypercarbia
improved on BiPAP in the ICU. Pt w history of COPD and given
elevated Hct and bicarb on admit, likely chronic co2 retainer
and chronically hypoxic. PNA on repeat PA/lateral as well as ?
interestitial disease. She was weaned off oxygen and maintained
oxygen saturation >90. She did desaturate on ambulation on and
off. She does require 1-2L NC at home, either overnight or on
ambulation. Her PCP has looked into this extensively in the
past, and given her continued smoking and living situation, it
would be a [**Doctor Last Name 13205**] for her to keep an oxygen tank at home. She
was thus discharged off oxygen. She was on levaquin for a 5 day
course. She was also on Prednisone for a 5 days for treatment of
COPD execarbation and PNA.
.
Diarrhea: This started after she started levaquin. Most likely
abx related. Also might be secondary to dietary indiscretions
since only eating ice cream while here. C diff negative x1.
.
s/p Fall: Sounds mechanical in nature. Head CT shows no bleed.
Patient is awake, alert and well-related. PT: recommend home
with PT
