Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4309**]
Chief Complaint:
Fever and hypoxia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **] y/o F with PMH significant for CHF, HTN, dementia, and s/p
CVA admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**1-1**] with fevers and hypoxia. Pt was
apparently in her normal state of health until [**1-1**] when she
was noted at [**Hospital1 100**] Senior Life to be lethargic with a fever of
101, tachypnia, and hyperglycemia with a BS of over 400. Pt was
given a dose of tylenol, started on oxygen via nasal cannula,
and transferred to the ED at [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation. In
the ED, the pt's VS were >104.8  132  114/70 --> 94/palp  30
96% 3L NC. The pt received zosyn, vancomycin, and flagyl. She
was started on the sepsis protocol and levophed was required to
support her BP in addition to 3 L of NS. Pt was then transferred
to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for further care.

In the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], the pt was noted to be lethargic and unable to
answer any questions on arrival. At that time, her temperature
had decreased to 97.5  but she was on a NRB with an oxygen
saturation of 100%. Significantly, her WBC count was 30.4 with
11% bands. The pt's antibiotics were adjusted to vancomycin,
flagyl, and ceftiraxone. She was also started on an insulin drip
to optamize glucose control. In further diagnostic workup, pt
was found to have a positive UA with concern for urosepsis. This
was confirmed when urine and blood cultures from [**1-1**] became
positive for Proteous mirabilis. She was started on zosyn to
cover her infection. In addition, there was a concern for C diff
so the pt was started on PO vancomycin. Pt was weaned of off the
levophed on [**1-2**] and overnight went into rapid atrial fib
requiring a diltiazem drip for control. The dilt drip was able
to be weaned off on [**1-3**] and she was restarted on her PO beta
blocker. In further events, pt had episodes of hyoglycemia on
[**1-3**] for which she was started on D5 drip but this has now been
weaned off and the pt is maintaining stable blood sugars. She
will be transferred to the floor for further care at this time.

Past Medical History:
1. Recurrent episodes of C diff- Reported to be resistent to
flagyl in the past and treated with PO vancomycin.
2. CHF- LVEF of 35% with an inferior wall motion abnormality.
3. S/P CVA with left hemiparesis
4. HTN
5. PVD
6. Dementia
7. Depression
8. H/O endocarditis- Pt was found to have Staph hominnis and
finished treatment with a six week course of vancomycin in
[**5-/2135**]
9. Type 2 DM
10. Cataracts
11. Ostoporosis

CHEST, SINGLE AP SUPINE PORTABLE VIEW (01/0/06): There is a new
left internal jugular central venous catheter, whose tip
probably lies in the upper atrium. If clinically indicated, it
could be pulled back by 1-2 cm. The cardiac and mediastinal
contours are unchanged. Again, noted is pulmonary edema, and a
left lower lobe opacity, likely atelectasis.
.
Cardiology Report ECG Study Date of ([**2136-1-1**]):
Atrial flutter with 2:1 A-V conduction. Prior anteroseptal
myocardial
infarction. Compared to the previous tracing of [**2135-7-3**] there
are continued slight ST segment elevations in leads V1-V2, more
prominent ST segment depressions in leads V4-V6 and associated T
wave inversions consistent with concomitant anterolateral
ischemic process. Followup and clinical correlation are
suggested. Rule out myocardial infarction.

**FINAL REPORT [**2136-1-4**]**
CLOSTRIDIUM DIFFICILE TOXIN ASSAY (Final [**2136-1-4**]):
FECES NEGATIVE FOR C. DIFFICILE TOXIN BY EIA.
Reference Range:  Negative.























Brief Hospital Course:
[**Age over 90 **] y/o F with PMH significant for CHF, HTN, dementia, and s/p
CVA admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**1-1**] with fevers and hypoxia. Found to
have urosepsis for which she is being treated with Zosyn. Also
being treated emperically for C diff given very elevated WBC
count on admission and history of multiple episodes of C diff.
Course complicated by rapid atrial fib and hypoglycemia now both
resolved.
.
1. [**Name (NI) 22117**] Pt found to have urosepsis with blood and urine
cultures from [**1-1**] growing Proteus mirabilis. Pt is now
hemodinamically stable off of pressers. She is being treated
with Zosyn with plans to complete a 14 day course. Follow blood
cultures from [**1-2**] to ensure that they remain negative. Avoid
foley catheter.
.
2. Question C diff- Concern for C diff in this pt given her very
elevated WBC count early in admission and history of multiple
episodes of C diff. Her C diff in the past has been resistent to
flagyl and treated with PO vancomycin. At this time, pt is being
emperically treated with PO vancomycin. She has had one C diff
sent on [**1-4**] which wa
