History of Present Illness:
73 y/o F with h/o CAD s/p CABGx2, h/o CHF, PPM, PaHTN, CKD.
She has had several days of generally feeling unwell with
increased cough productive of clear sputum. Today, she was
watching football and preparing for bed early when she had
sudden left sided LLQ/flank/back pain that led to nausea and
almost immediate non-bloody vomiting. The pain persisted and was
a severe achiness, and she presented to [**Hospital3 24768**].
There, she had a U/A with trace blood and 3-5rbcs, and
non-contrast abdominal CT which was negative for
nephro/ureterolithiasis or free air. She was transferred to
[**Hospital1 18**] for further management.

In the ED, vital signs were initially: 97.6 50irreg 123/86 18 97

While being worked up, she also developed chest pain that she
stated was her anginal equivalent that has been occuring on a
near daily basis, confirmed with discussion with her PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) 3754**]
were no significant ECG changes reported with the chest pain
that was recalcitrant to SL NTG but responded with IV morphine.

The ED staff recommended abdominal CT scanning with PO and IV
contrast for further workup. They began premedicating with
prednisone 40mg, ranitidine 150mg and diphenhydrame 50mg which
she started at 2:30am. She also started receiving normal saline
at 75cc/hr.

On the floor after receiving IV morphine in the ED, she is
currently entirely free of chest and abdominal pain.
