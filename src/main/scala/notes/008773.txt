Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 668**]
Chief Complaint:
OSH transfer- Lower extremity weakness/cauda equina
Perforated bowel

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2152-4-27**] Exploratory laparotomy, Right colectomy, ileostomy
placement
[**2152-5-9**] Tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy.


History of Present Illness:
57 y/o male w/ probable metastatic lung ca, met to L5 spine, who
presents from OSH with leg weakness secondary to cauda equina
syndrome. He was admitted to [**Hospital **] hospital on [**2152-4-17**] with a
20 lb weight loss and long standing history of progressive low
back pain, followed by leg weakness. The low back pain has been
an issue for the last 2-3 years, but over the last 2 months has
become more severe and has radiated to his posterior thigh and
calves. In addition he reports numbness of his feet, which began
2-3 years ago. Within the last 2 weeks he has not been able to
walk and has been wheelchair bound. He reports that he cannot
stand due to pain rather than to weakness. He denies loss of
bowel or bladder function.

Neuro evaluation there on [**2152-4-17**] showed normal pin sensation of
LEs, although there was subjective numbness of the feet. No
focal weakness of the extremity muscles was noted to manual
testing and DTRs were noted to be 1+ and symmetric at knees, and
absent at ankles.

Work-up showed a destructive lesion in L5 with a soft tissue
component, likely representing metastatic disease. There was
also evidence of pathologic compression of the body of L5 and
severe foraminal narrowing at L5-S1 with cauda equina
compression.  He was also found to have a cavitary lesion in the
right upper lobe of the lung measuring almost 1cm, suspicious
for nonsmall cell lung cancer, likely squamous cell. Biopsy of
the L5 lesion was performed and results were pendning at time of
transfer. The patient was started on reglan and external beam
XRT. His pain improved after optimization of his pain regimen,
however he became constipated. He also had a foley placed for
?urinary retention. He was seen daily by neurosurgery and there
was a long debate on how to proceed. Clinically the patient was
not improving and still had significant leg weakness, and
therefore it was recommended by the neurosurgeons to transfer
him for consideration of cyberknife treatment.

Note dated [**2152-4-20**] comments that patient reported legs were
weaker than the day prior. Note dated [**2152-4-24**] reports patient can
lift lower extremities bilaterally but cannot wiggle toes with
slight foot drop on L.

On arrival today, patient reports pain in low back. Complains of
weakness and numbness of his lower extremities, which he reports
has become worse over the last 2 days. He reports constipation
and abdominal distention, however he does admit to having a
small BM yesterday. He also admits though that he does have
numbness in his buttocks and does not feel that he has full
control over his bowel movements. In regards to urinary
retention, this is less clear, because he currently has a foley
catheter. He reports this was placed after he was told his urine
output was not as good as it should be.
Denies upper extremity weakness or numbness. no cough,
hoarseness, chest pain, sob.

ROS: as per hpi. also denies cough, sob, sputum production or
hemoptysis. no headache, n/v, vision changes. low back pain, +
left hip pain, lower extremity weakness, and numbness in toes.

Pertinent Results:
Reports-
MRI [**2152-4-18**]- Mild pathologic compression fx of L5. Tumor has
destroyed posterior cortex of the vertebral body and causes
critical spinal stenosis at this level with critical compression
of the cauda equina. Extension of tumor into the posterior
elements. Severe bilateral foraminal narrowing at L5-S1 and
moderate bilateral foraminal narrowing at L4-L5.

Ct guided bone bx [**2152-4-21**]- pending at time of transfer

[**2152-4-22**] KUB no intestinal obstruction or other acute
intr-abdominal abnormality. lytic metastatic dx involving left
side body L5.

[**2152-4-19**] Bone scan- probable mild to moderate generalized
peripheral arthritic changes as described above. Otherwise
negative for significant focal skeletal lesion in the rest of
the whole body. Negative for significant focal skeletal lesion
in the thoracolumbar vertebrae.

[**2152-4-20**]- MRI brain- no evidence of intracranial metastasis.
normal contrast enhanced brain MRI.   Trace chronic paranasal
sinus disease.

[**2152-4-18**]- CT chest- Cavity lesion right upper lung, 9mm. Right
hilar adenopathy. calcied lymph node left hilum. small
non-calcified nodule left upper lung posteriorly.

[**2152-4-18**]- CT abd- liver, spleen, panc, gb unremarkable. no extra
or intrahepatic ductal dilatation. right and left kidneys
unremarkable

[**2152-4-27**] AXR - FINDINGS: There is a large amount of free
intraperitoneal air. There is contrast in the large bowel. There
is a right upper lobe lung mass, better characterized on recent
chest radiograph, but appears to contain cavitation.

CTA Chest [**2152-4-30**]
FINDINGS:
1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
2. Multifocal ground-glass opacity and consolidation
superimposed upon diffuse centrilobular emphysema. The most
likely cause for these findings includes ARDS or multifocal
pneumonia.
3. Small pneumoperitoneum.

[**2152-5-4**]
IMPRESSION:
1. Increase in size of the patient's right upper lobe cavitary
lesion as noted. Decreased prominence of bilateral patchy
airspace opacities previously noted. Persistent airspace
opacities seen within the right lung with debris in the right
mainstem bronchus as noted. Soft tissue attenuation surrounding
the airways of the right lung as noted, likely reflecting the
patient's known lung carcinoma.
2. Significant distention of numerous loops of small bowel. The
diffuse nature of this distention suggests a functional ileus.
No area of transition is seen to suggest a mechanical
small-bowel obstruction.
3. Free fluid seen within the peritoneal cavity. If clin
