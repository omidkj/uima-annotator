Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 30**]
Chief Complaint:
Tx from OSH with pancreatitis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation
Central line placement
Arterial line placement X 2

History of Present Illness:
52YO female, pw four day history of N/V/D, generalized weakness
and decreased PO.  Pt denied abdominal pain.  On arrival to
[**Location (un) **] she was noted to have o2 sats of 87% on RA.  In
addition, she was tachycardic to 118.  She was ill appearing and
cachectic with "cyanotic" fingers.  Pt had an initial ph of
7.08, 20, po2 68.  Her bicarb was five.  Pt had elevated
troponin to 1.16.  She received three amps of bicarb with D5,
cipro 400 IV, flagyl 500 IV.  EKG demonstrated antero inferior q
waves.  ETOH at presentation was 50.  At [**Name (NI) **], pt received 5
liters of normal saline. Pt transferred from [**Location (un) **] by
[**Location (un) **]

Pt was intubated and sedated on arrival to [**Hospital1 18**].  She was noted
to have a heart rate of 125 and a blood pressure of 97/60.  Her
exam was notable for coarse but equal breath sounds and a
distended abdomen.  Pt was noted to be guiac positive,  She was
evaluated by general surgery out of concern for necrotizing
pancreatitis.  They concluded that given the patient's
down-trending LFT's and CT changes, these were not consistent
with nec pancreatitis. In the ED, the patient received another
four liters of normal saline for a total-pre-arrival to the MICU
of 9 liters of IV fluid. At [**Hospital1 18**], pt received zosyn, thiamine,
Pt was admitted to the MICU for further evaluation and
treatment.

[**2107-12-31**] CT ABD:
IMPRESSION:
1. Moderate amount of stranding within the anterior pararenal
space surrounding the pancreas, which is consistent with the
clinical diagnosis of acute pancreatitis. There is no evidence
of complication (on this essentially unenhanced scan).
2. Persistent renal parenchymal enhancement, with a somewhat
striated appearance, which despite the normal serum creatinine,
raises the question of acute renal dysfunction, particularly ATN
or other tubular abnormality. This should be correlated with
clinical and laboratory information.
3. Low-attenuation liver consistent with generalized fatty
infiltration.
4. Large consolidation in the lower lobes bilaterally and
posteriorly, raises the possibility of aspiration pneumonia.
5. Mild hypodensity in the wall of the cecum and ascending colon
which could represent submucosal edema with mild apparent
hyperemia of the mucosa, focally. This finding is nonspecific,
and could related to the patient's known hypoalbuminemia;
correlation with the clinical status of the patient is
recommended.
6. High density within the cystic duct and common bile duct as
well as intermediate density within the gallbladder. These
findings, in this context, are most suggestive of vicarious
excretion of contrast, also suggestive of underlying renal
abnormality.

[**2107-12-31**]:
ECG: Sinus tachycardia. Diffuse low QRS voltage. Left axis
deviation. Poor  R wave progression - cannot rule out old
anteroseptal myocardial infarction. Diffuse non-specific ST-T
wave changes which are non-specific. No previous tracing
available for comparison.

[**2108-1-1**]:
CXR: There has been interval worsening in bibasilar
consolidations and effusions greater on the right side. There is
no pneumothorax. ET tube and NG tube remain in place

[**2108-1-10**]
ECHO:
The left atrium is normal in size. The left ventricular cavity
size is normal. There is moderate global left ventricular
hypokinesis (LVEF = 35-40 %). Systolic function of apical
segments is relatively preserved. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
are mildly thickened. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Physiologic mitral regurgitation is seen (within
normal limits). There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is an anterior space which most likely
represents a fat pad.
Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable
for review) of [**2108-1-2**], biventricular systolic function is now
improved.

[**2108-1-12**]
CT ABD/Pelvis:
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of pancreatic pseudocyst or hepatobiliary
obstruction.
2. Multifocal pneumonia.
3. Featureless sigmoid colon may represent C. diff infection.
Recommend correlation with serum C. Diff toxin markers.
4. Fatty liver, unchanged since [**2108-1-5**].
5. Anasarca, unchanged since [**2108-1-5**].


Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 52 year old female transferred from OSH with
pancreatitis, likely ETOH, intubated with possible ARDS and
aspiration pna.

# Pancreatitis: Nausea, vomiting, decreased PO, CT scan, and
lipase of > 1000 demonstrate pancreatitis on admission. There
was no evidence of hemorrhage or pseudocyst on CT scan.  She was
transferred from [**Hospital3 7569**] and intubated at in the ED and
then transferred to the MICU.  She was extubated successfully
and transferred out to the medical floor.  Patient admits to
drinking whiskey daily which is the likely cause of her
pancreatitis.  Her pancreatitis has now resolved and she has
been advanced to a PO diet.  She is to follow up with her
primary care physician as an outpatient.  She was educated on
the harms of alcohol abuse and was told to refrain from any EtOH
use in the future as it may precipitate another episode of
pancreatitis.

# Acute on chronic systolic heart failure:  TTE on [**1-2**] with
LVEF 25%, with severe global hypokinesis. [**1-10**] f/u TTE showed
improvement in systolic function.  Patient denies
