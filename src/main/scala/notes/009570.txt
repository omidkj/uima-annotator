ON DISCHARGE:
She is neurologically intact- a nad o x3, full motors, nl
sensation.  She does have fullness and tenderness at site of
craniotomy but no drainage or erythema

Pertinent Results:
[**4-18**] IMPRESSION CTA:
1. Diffuse subarachnoid hemorrhage, most prominent in the left
sylvian
fissure.
2. Sulcal effacement and slight prominence of the ventricular
system,
including the temporal horns of the lateral ventricles,
suggestive of cerebral edema and possible early obstructive
hydrocephalus.
3. CTA demonstrates 4-mm aneurysm at the left MCA bifurcation.
No other
aneurysms or vascular abnormalities are identified. There is no
evidence for vasospasm.

[**4-19**] IMPRESSION CT:
1. Diffuse subarachnoid hemorrhage with worsening cerebral
edema,rightward
subfalcine herniation and unchanged mild uncal herniation.
2. Postoperative pneumocephalus.
3. Unchanged small intraventricular hemorrhage in the posterior
[**Doctor Last Name 534**] of left lateral ventricle.


[**4-25**] CONTRAST HEAD CT:
IMPRESSION:
1. Persistent cerebral edema. Slightly decreased left subfalcine
herniation.
2. No new hemorrhage.
3. Slightly decreased size of the lateral ventricles.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP [**2180-4-24**]
Final Report
IMPRESSION: No acute pulmonary process.

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST [**2180-4-22**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. Persistent cerebral edema. Slightly decreased left subfalcine
herniation.
2. No new hemorrhage.
3. Slightly decreased size of the lateral ventricles.

CT BRAIN PERFUSION [**2180-4-25**]
IMPRESSION:
1. Left aneurysmal clip as well as left MCA aneurysm as detailed
above.
There is no evidence of new hemorrhage, small calibers of the
MCAs bilaterally can be seen with mild vasospasm. Recommend
ongoing imaging followup.
Otherwise, there is minimal change with persistent cerebral
edema and improved right deviation of normal midline anatomy.


ABDOMEN (SUPINE & ERECT) [**2180-4-29**]:
Gas-filled loops of nondistended small and large bowel are
present throughout the abdomen, with air identified distally in
the rectosigmoid region. No free intraperitoneal air is
identified. Contrast is present within both renal collecting
systems and within the bladder, probably related to recent
cerebral angiogram study performed earlier the same date.

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST [**2180-5-2**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. Overall, minimal change since [**2180-5-1**] with no
ventricular
enlargement following clinical history of clamping of
ventriculostomy
catheter.

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST [**2180-5-4**]

IMPRESSION: No hemorrhage. Removal of right transfrontal
ventriculostomy
catheter. No change in size or configuration of the ventricles.





Brief Hospital Course:
Pt was brought in from OSH for SAH after intercourse on the
evening of [**2180-4-18**].  The following a.m.   Pt was emergently
brought to angio for further evaluation with possible coiling.
It was decided her PCA aneurysm would best be treated in the
operating room.  She was brought directly from the angio suite
to the OR for open clipping of PCA aneurysm. She was then
transferred to the ICU and was extubated.

After extubation she was opening eyes and following commands.
Her drian output was followed closely and a clamping trial was
initiated on [**2180-4-24**]

CTA/P was performed on [**2180-4-25**] and showed no evidence of stroke
or vasospasm, put persistant and stable cerebral edema and
slight midline shift.

On [**2180-4-28**] angiogram / cerebral for coil of Left MCA aneurysm
was completed.  EVD remained in place.  Heparin gtt was started
and angio sheeth was kept in place.  Repeat angiography on
[**2180-4-29**] was done and heparin gtt was stopped.  Pt was started on
ASA 325 daily.

EVD clamp trial was started on [**2180-4-30**].  On [**2180-5-1**] repeat CT
scan showed increased size of anterior horns of lateral
ventricles.  Drain remains clamped and repeat CT scan will be
performed on [**2180-5-2**].  Her exam remains stable and she has been
OOB to chair.

Repeat CT scan did not show interval increase in the size of her
ventricles - her EVD was removed. She was transferred to the
step down unit and a-line and foley were d/c'd. Her wound was
clean and dry though she did complain of pain at site -
swelling/fluctuance present but no erythema or drainage.  Her
diet and activity were advanced.

PT and OT eval'd pt for needs and recommended rehab placement.
