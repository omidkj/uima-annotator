Service: CARDIOTHORACIC

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1267**]
Chief Complaint:
New onset Atrial Fibrillation

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2144-10-15**] - CABGx3(LIMA->LAD, SVG->OM, PDA)


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is an 88 year old gentleman admitted to [**Hospital1 63061**] with new onset atriall fibrillation. A work-up which
included a cardiac catheterization revealed mitral regurgitation
and three vessel disease with an ejection fractioon of 25%. He
was thus transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] for surgical management.

Social History:
Lives in [**Location 65669**], RI with wife. Former [**Name2 (NI) 1818**]. Rare alcohol
use.

Family History:
Unremarkable

Physical Exam:
NEURO: Grossly intact, no bruits
PULM: Clear
HEART: Irregularly, irregular with systolic murmur
ABD: Benign
EXT: Warm, no edema.

Pertinent Results:
[**2144-10-14**] ECHO
1.The left atrium is normal in size. The left atrium is
elongated.
2.There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. There is severe global left
ventricular hypokinesis with more marked anterior and septal
severe hypokinesis. Overall left ventricular systolic function
is severely depressed. Though not well seen, suspect therer is a
large thrombus is seen in the apex of the left ventricle, which
happears endothelialized.
3. Right ventricular chamber size is normal. Right ventricular
systolic
function is normal.
4.The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. No aortic
regurgitation is seen.
5.The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+)
mitral
regurgitation is seen.
6.There is no pericardial effusion.

[**2144-10-19**] CXR
Small left apical pneumothorax has decreased slightly since
[**10-18**] following removal of the left pleural drain. There
is no appreciable pleural effusion. Mild left lower lobe
atelectasis and small right pleural effusion persist. Moderate
cardiomegaly is stable. There is no pulmonary edema.

[**2144-10-15**] EKG
Probable slow atrial flutter with atrial rate 200, 2:1 A-V block
and
ventricular rate 100. Borderline left anterior hemiblock. Right
bundle-branch block. Cannot exclude old inferior wall myocardial
infarction. Anterolateral T wave inversions consistent with
ischemia. Compared to the previous tracing of [**2144-10-15**] atrial
fibrillation has given way to atrial flutter and the axis is
more leftward. The anterolateral repolarization changes are
essentially the same.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2144-10-14**] via transfer from
[**Hospital3 45967**] for further management of his coronary artery
and mitral valve disease. He remained pain free on heparin. He
was worked-up in the usual preoperative manner by the cardiac
surgical service. An echo was performed which showed only 1+
mitral regurgitation and an ejection fraction of 25-35%. On
[**2144-10-15**], Mr. [**Known lastname **] was taken to the operating room where he
underwent coronary artery bypass grafting to three vessels. An
intraoperative TEE again showed only 1+ mitral regurgitation and
thus there was no intervention on the mitral valve.
Postoperatively he was taken to the cardiac surgical intensive
care unit for monitoring. On postoperative day one, Mr. [**Known lastname **] [**Last Name (Titles) **]e neurologically intact and was extubated. Beta blockade and
aspirin were resumed. On postoperative day two, Mr. [**Known lastname **] was
transferred to the cardiac surgical step down unit for further
recovery. He was gently diuresed towards his preoperative
weight. The physical therapy service was consulted for
assistance with his postoperative strength and mobility. As he
remained in atrial fibrillation, Mr. [**Known lastname **] was started on
coumadin. He was very sensitive to coumadin with his INR rising
to 6.4, the result was rechecked with a value of 6.1.  His
coumadin was discontinued.  He was then transfused with two
units of FFP which resulted in acute pulmonary edema with
respiratory distressed.  Mr. [**Known lastname **] was diuresed with IV lasix and
morphine, and he was treated with boluses of metoprolol for
reflex tachycardia with rates up to the 180's.  After he was
stabilized and his pulmonary edema resolved he was transferred
to the ICU for monitoring overnight.  On postoperative day 6 He
was transferred back to the stepdown unit in good condition and
Physical therapy resumed. His INR on [**2144-10-22**] was 1.6.  Aspirin
325mg daily was started for anticoagulation.  He will be
evaluated as an outpatient for future need of coumadin by his
cardiologist. An ace inhibitor should be started as an
outpatient when his blood pressure can tolerate.  Mr. [**Known lastname **]
continued to make steady progress and was discharged to home
with his family on postoperative day eight. He will follow-up
with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], his cardiologist and his primary care physician
as an outpatient.
