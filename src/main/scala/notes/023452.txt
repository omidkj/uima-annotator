Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 25699**] is a 64 year old male with diabetes mellitus and
ESRD, s/p renal transplantation, who presented [**Hospital 1474**] Hospital
in congestive heart failure. Echocardiogram was notable for
[**Hospital1 **]-atrial enlargement, moderate to severe mitral regurgitation,
and an LVEF of 55%. Further evaluation included cardiac
catheterization which revealed severe three vessel coronary
artery disease. After outpatient evaluation, he was eventually
cleared to undergo cardiac surgical intervention.

Past Medical History:
Chronic Diastolic Congestive Heart Failure

Left AV Fistula
Obesity
Diabetic Retinopathy, Legally Blind Right Eye

Social History:
Remote history of tobacco, quit 37 years ago. Admits to [**3-30**] ETOH
drinks/day. He is retired and lives alone.

Family History:
No history of premature coronary artery disease.

Physical Exam:
PREOP EXAM:
Vitals: 124/60, 80, 22
General: No acute distress, ruddy complexion
HEENT: Oropharynx benign, EOMI
Neck: Supple, no JVD, transmitted murmur noted
Lungs: CTA right side, bibasilar rales on left
Heart: Regular rate and rhythm, 3/6 systolic ejection murmur
Abdomen: Soft, nontender with normoactive bowel sounds
Ext: Warm, no edema. Left wrist AV fistula. Bilateral venous
stasis changes with rubor changes at feet.
Pulses: 1+ distally
Neuro: Alert and oriented, CN 2- 12 grossly intact, no focal
deficits noted

Pertinent Results:
[**2171-3-1**] Intraop TEE:
Prebypass
1. The left atrium is dilated. No spontaneous echo contrast is
seen in the left atrial appendage. No thrombus is seen in the
left atrial appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or
color Doppler.
2. Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). [Intrinsic
left ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed
given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
3. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal.
4. There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
5. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with
good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. There is no
aortic valve stenosis.
6. The mitral valve leaflets are moderately thickened. The
mitral regurgitation vena contracta is >=0.7cm. Severe (4+)
mitral regurgitation is seen.

Post Bypass
1. Patient is V paced and receiving an infusion of epinephrine.
2. Bioprosthetic valve seen in the mitral position. Leaflets
move well and the valve appears well seated. Trivial mitral
regurgitation. Mean gradient across the valve is 4 mm Hg.
3. Aorta intact post decannulation.
4. LVEF is 40%. RV function is normal.

REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
r/o ptx
STUDY: AP CHEST, [**2171-3-3**].

HISTORY: 64-year-old man status post CABG and chest tube

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 25699**] was admitted and underwent coronary artery bypass
grafting surgery along with mitral valve replacment and ligation
of left atrial appendage. For surgical details, please see
seperate dictated operative note. Following the procedure, he
was transferred to the CVICU for invasive monitoring. Within 24
hours, he awoke neurologically intact and was extubated without
incident. Pacemaker interrogation showed his pacemaker was
functioning normally and reprogrammed to VVI @ 60. His
underlying rhythm was complete heart block in atrial
fibrillation. His CVICU course was uneventful and he transferred
to the SDU on postoperative day two. Warfarin anticoagulation
was started for atrial fibrillation and dosed for a goal INR
between 2.0 - 3.0. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was contact[**Name (NI) **] prior to discharge
and had agreed to monitor INR as an outpatient. He continued to
make clinical improvements with diuresis and made steady
progress with physical therapy. He was discharged to home on
POD#4 in stable condition.
