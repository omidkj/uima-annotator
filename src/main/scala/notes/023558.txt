Admission Date:  [**2130-11-13**]       Discharge Date:  [**2130-12-6**]


Service:  MICU

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:   The patient is an 85-year-old
woman with a history of congestive heart failure, peripheral
vascular disease, Type 2 diabetes mellitus, and Parkinson's
disease, who was admitted after being found unresponsive at
home.  The patient was in her usual state of health until 1
P.M. on the day of admission, when she was found by her
cousin, who lives with her.  The patient was unresponsive,
apparently no longer than 30 seconds.  She slumped forward,
and EMS was called.  There were no preceding palpitations,
shortness of breath, chest pain, focal weakness, dysarthria,
bowel or bladder incontinence, or seizure activity noted.
EMS noted the patient to have a finger stick blood glucose of
240, atrial fibrillation on the monitor, with a rate of 100,
blood pressure of 136/palp, respiration rate of 4, and
initially unresponsive.  Her pupils were equal, round and
reactive to light.

The patient was intubated and, during intubation, she was
noted to have increased agitation.  She was given 2 mg of
Versed, successfully intubated, and sent to [**Hospital1 346**], where she was immediately brought
to the Medical Intensive Care Unit.  Upon arrival, she was
hemodynamically stable.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Congestive heart failure, last echocardiogram in [**2130-8-14**] showed mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy,
an ejection fraction of greater than 55%, and 1+ aortic
insufficiency and mitral regurgitation.  There was normal
right ventricular function.  She was admitted in [**2130-8-14**] with increasing peripheral edema and orthopnea.  She was
diuresed 3 liters, ruled out by enzymes, and had a negative
ETT MIBI.
2.  Hypercholesterolemia
3.  Hypertension
4.  Peripheral vascular disease status post bilateral carotid
endarterectomy in [**2121**]
5.  Type 2 diabetes mellitus with peripheral neuropathy and
glaucoma
6.  Parkinson's disease, followed by neurologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
7.  Osteoarthritis

ALLERGIES:   There are no known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS:   Sinemet 25/100 one-half tablet by mouth three
times a day, Lidoderm patch, Timoptic and Xalatan eyedrops
one drop per eye every day, Miacalcin spray one spray
alternating nostrils once daily, NPH insulin 5 units
subcutaneously every morning, Neurontin 600 mg by mouth three
times a day, atenolol 75 mg by mouth once daily, lasix 40 mg
by mouth every Monday, Wednesday and Friday, Protonix 40 mg
by mouth once daily, Zestril 5 mg by mouth once daily.

SOCIAL HISTORY:   She lives with her cousin.  She is
minimally ambulatory at baseline.  She uses a wheelchair and
a walker, needs help with her activities of daily living.
She quit tobacco 15 years ago.  The patient had been at
[**Hospital3 2732**] Home for approximately one and a half
months following her [**Month (only) 359**] admission for congestive heart
failure.  While there, she had been placed on supplemental
oxygen by nasal cannula.  She was discharged home on oxygen
one and a half weeks prior to her readmission.

FAMILY HISTORY:   Father died of a myocardial infarction at
age 39.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:   Stable four-pillow orthopnea, decreasing
peripheral edema over baseline, stable dyspnea on exertion,
no chest pain, oxygen 2 liters nasal cannula at home, no
fevers or chills, no abdominal pain, no change in urinary
symptoms, no cough.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:   Temperature 98.4, heart rate 82 and
regular, blood pressure 154/57, respirations 15, oxygen
saturation 96%, weight 90.9 kg.  Ventilated on IMV mode with
tidal volumes of 700, rate of 10, pressure support of 5, and
PEEP of 5, with FIO2 of 100%.  In general, intubated,
responding to questions, appears comfortable.  Head, eyes,
ears, nose and throat:  Normocephalic, atraumatic,
extraocular movements intact, pupils equal, round and
reactive to light, mucous membranes moist, no lesions.  Neck:
Jugular venous pressure difficult to determine.  There is a
left carotid bruit.  Cardiovascular:  Regular rate and
rhythm, normal S1 and S2, I/VI systolic murmur at the upper
sternal border.  Lungs:  Decreased breath sounds at the right
base, otherwise clear to auscultation bilaterally, without
rales, rhonchi or wheezes.  Abdomen:  Soft, obese,
nondistended, right lower quadrant and left lower quadrant
mildly tender, no rebound, no guarding, positive bowel
sounds.  Extremities:  Trace pretibial edema bilaterally, no
cords.  Rectal:  Guaiac negative, normal tone.  Neurological:
Cranial nerves II through XII intact, moving all extremities,
equal strength, [**3-18**] throughout upper and lower.  Sensation
normal throughout.  Patellar reflexes 2+ bilaterally, absent
ankle jerks.  Left upper extremity with resting tremor.

LABORATORY DATA:   On admission, white blood cells 4.1,
hematocrit 29.2, platelets 227.  PT 13.3, PTT 29.9, and INR
1.2.  Sodium 138, potassium 4.8, chloride 94, bicarbonate 33,
BUN 30, creatinine 1.2, glucose 121.  Magnesium 2.1,
phosphate 3.7, calcium not measured.  ALT 9, AST 71, alkaline
phosphatase 80, total bilirubin 0.5, albumin 3.2, serum
osmolality 298.  CPK and troponin were negative.  Urinalysis
was negative for urinary tract infection.  Serum toxicology
screen was negative.   Urine toxicology screen was positive
for benzodiazepines.  Arterial blood gas was 7.55/36/220 on
100% FIO2 with the ventilator settings as listed above.  CT
scan of the head showed no intracerebral bleed.  Chest x-ray
showed bilateral hilar fullness and upper zone
redistribution.  Electrocardiogram was normal sinus rhythm at
78, with normal axis.  There were peaked T waves in Leads V2
through V6.  There were no ST or T changes suggestive of
ischemia, no Q waves consistent with electrocardiogram
performed in [**2130-8-14**].

IMPRESSION:   This was an 85-year-old woman with a history of
diastolic dysfunction, Type 2 diabetes mellitus, Parkinson's
disease, who was found unresponsive and intubated in the
field, but whose neurologic function upon admission appeared
to be at baseline.

HOSPITAL COURSE:   Initially the patient's primary disorder
was thought to be neurologic in origin.  Therefore, the
Neurology service was consulted.  It was thought that perhaps
the patient had a basilar artery transient ischemic attack.
A head CT was performed, and this was negative.  Therefore,
it was thought that the patient did not have a primary
neurologic event.  She ruled out for myocardial infarction.
There was no recurrence of the atrial fibrillation noted on
the monitor in the field.  Her aspirin, atenolol, Zestril and
Lipitor were continued.

Two days after admission, on the [**8-15**], while the
patient's cousin was visiting, the patient was noted to slump
over and become unresponsive for a second time.  Rhythm strip
showed junctional escape with a heart rate of 15.  She was
assumed to be in bradycardic arrest.  She was intubated for a
second time, and the electrophysiology division of the
Cardiology service was consulted.  She was thought to have a
sick sinus syndrome, and a DDD pacer was placed.  Lasix was
given for diuresis.  She received bronchoscopy, which removed
a large dried mucous plug at the tip of the endotracheal
tube.  Bronchial washings from that bronchoscopy revealed
only gram-negative rods on Gram [**Last Name (LF) 2733**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] she was started on
ceftriaxone and Flagyl.

The following day, on the [**8-17**], she was extubated.
However, she required very high levels of oxygen to maintain
her saturations above 90%.  To investigate this, a chest
x-ray was performed which revealed bilateral pleural
effusions, as well as cardiomegaly.  An echocardiogram was
performed that showed mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy, preserved left ventricular function with an
ejection fraction greater than 55%, normal right ventricular
systolic function, trace aortic regurgitation, mild mitral
regurgitation, and no pericardial effusion.  There was no
change compared to the echocardiogram performed in [**2130-8-14**].

In light of these findings, we postulated that the cause of
her poor oxygenation was multifactorial, including
restrictive lung disease from obesity an
