Findings
This study was compared to the prior study of [**2157-5-26**].
LEFT ATRIUM: Normal LA and RA cavity sizes.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: A catheter or pacing wire is
seen in the RA.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thickness and cavity size. Mild
regional LV systolic dysfunction. Estimated cardiac index is
normal (>=2.5L/min/m2). TDI E/e' >15, suggesting PCWP>18mmHg. No
resting LVOT gradient.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTA: Normal diameter of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch
levels. Focal calcifications in aortic root. Normal descending
aorta diameter.

AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS.
No AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Normal mitral valve leaflets. No MVP. Mild (1+)
MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets with trivial
TR. Mild to moderate [[**12-1**]+] TR. Normal PA systolic pressure.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflet.
No PS. Physiologic PR.

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: Results were reviewed with the Cardiology
Fellow involved with the patient's care.

REGIONAL LEFT VENTRICULAR WALL MOTION:





     N = Normal, H = Hypokinetic, A = Akinetic, D = Dyskinetic
Conclusions
The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. Left
ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There
is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
focal hypokinesis of the distal septum and apex. There is mild
hypokinesis of the remaining segments (LVEF = 45 %). The
estimated cardiac index is normal (>=2.5L/min/m2). Tissue
Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling
pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size and free
wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
structurally normal. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild
(1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The estimated pulmonary
artery systolic pressure is normal. There is no pericardial
effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2157-5-26**],
global left ventricular systolic function is improved and a
myxoma is no longer visible. Mild mitral regurgitation is now
apparent.

CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS:
Based on [**2155**] AHA endocarditis prophylaxis recommendations, the
echo findings indicate prophylaxis is NOT recommended. Clinical
decisions regarding the need for prophylaxis should be based on
clinical and echocardiographic data.


Brief Hospital Course:
She was taken to the operating room on [**2157-5-31**] where she
underwent a CABG x 1, left atrial myxoma resection with
pericardial patch closure of septal defect. She was transferred
to the ICU in stable condition. She remained intubated overnight
for low PO2, and was extubated on POD #1. On POD #1 she had a VF
arrest, was shocked x 3, given 1 amp of epi and reintubated. She
returned to sinus. She was restarted on levophed and
epinephrine. She was seen by cardiology and ICD was not
indicated since it was an early post operative event. Cardiac
cath on POD #2 showed patent graft and 60% LAD. She was
extubated again on POD #3. She was started on heparin and
coumadin with plans for a 3 months course for her septal patch
repair. She was transferred to the floor on POD #6. Heparin was
switched to lovenox until INR > 2.0 for discharge and she was
ready for discharge home on POD # 8.
