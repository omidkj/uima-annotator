History of Present Illness:
84 year old female transferred from [**Hospital **] Hospital with
large IPH found on head CT. The patient lives in a nursing home
and has a h/o Alzheimer's Dementia and intermittent A-Fib. She
is
on aspirin but no coumadin. Last night the patient was in her
usual state of health prior to going to bed. This morning she
was
found down with confusion and left-sided weakness. She vomited
in
the nursing home and then again in the ambulance. Once at
[**Hospital **] Hospital she was intubated due to low oxygen
saturation
and confusion. Her BP was 199/109 when she arrived at the OSH
and
her sat was 88% on face mask. The patient was loaded with
dilantin and was given propofol for sedation prior to being
transported to [**Hospital1 18**]. When she arrived here her SBP was in the
60s and she was started on a dopamine drip in the ER. The
propofol was also stopped at that time. Neurosurgery consulted
for possible surgical intervention.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 79142**] was admitted to the ICU for close observation she
required ventilator assistance and vasoactive medication to keep
her systolic blood pressure greater than 100. She underwent a
head CT which showed a an unchanged large IPH after 12 hours. An
MRI showed no mass or cause of bleed. She was ruled in for an MI
and cardiology was consulted given her EKG changes. On her
second and third hospital day the neurosurgery team, the stroke
consult team, Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **] from Neurology and TSICU
representatives met with the family and explained the gravity of
her condition due to her poor exam (intact cranial
nerves,localizing in right arm,and was plegic on left side, she
did not follow commands or open her eyes). Ms. [**Known lastname 79142**] had a
very specific living will which outlined that she did not want
to have extraordinary measures if she would not have a good
quality of life. She was made CMO on [**2122-7-2**] and passed away
early in the morning of [**2122-7-3**].
