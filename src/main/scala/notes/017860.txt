Brief Hospital Course:
38 yo F with DMI, PVD s/p recent BKA presenting with diabetic
ketoacidosis.

# Diabetic Ketoacidosis: DKA [**3-7**] poor glycemic control and
insulin noncompliance, supported by HbA1c of 12. Pt reports
diabetes was bettercontrolled as a child but has found it
difficult to control since starting to manage it on her own. [**Month (only) 116**]
also have contribution from chemical pancreatitis or cocaine.
Patient transferred to MICU on insulin drip with appropriate
glycemic response, closing of anion gap, and improved mental
status. Lytes repleted aggressively. Transferred to floor when
stable. Insulin regimen changed to NPH 75/25 15 U qAM, 20 U qHS
with sliding scale, to be adjusted as needed. Pt discharged home
with services, including diabetes teaching. Pt scheduled to
follow up with [**Last Name (un) **] diabetes educator [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 16883**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 32249**] on
[**2111-12-24**], already scheduled to see Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 978**] on [**2112-1-20**].
Follow up also scheduled with PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) 1007**] on [**2111-12-22**].

# Leukocytosis: Initially concerning for possible infection but
did resolve off antibiotics. Pt remained afebrile. Urine culture
grew only yeast, not treated as patient asymptomatic. Blood
cultures x 2 pending with no growth to date at time of
discharge.

# Acute Renal Failure: Likely secondary to volume depletion in
setting of DKA, resolved at time of transfer to floor. Of note,
lasix held secondary to acute renal failure. Would recheck Cr at
time of follow-up.

# Altered Mental Status: Resolved, likely [**3-7**] DKA and metabolic
derangements. Psych recommended limiting use of narcotics,
benzos and anticholinergic meds to
avoid exacerbation of possible residual delirium. Also
recommended haldol or cogentin prn for agitation, which pt did
not require. Pt [**Name (NI) **] x 3 on transfer to floor. Psych recommended
restarting klonopin to anxiety, continued to hold lorazepam at
time of discharge.

# Depression: Psych evaluated patient who was very closed off
during her admission as she did not want to repeat her story to
another stranger. Psych was able to  determine that she did not
need inpatient treatment.  Pt open to the idea of being followed
by a psychiatrist at [**Hospital1 18**], provided with contact into to
schedule outpatient appointment.

# Hypertension: Medication initially held as blood pressures
running lower. However, these were added back tolerated. Pt on
home doses of clonidine and metoprolol on discharge. Lasix
continued to be held in context of acute renal fai
