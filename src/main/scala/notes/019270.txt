Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 30**]
Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Tracheal Stent Placement
SVC Stent Placement

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 73 year old man with history of laryngeal
cancer s/p external beam radiation, COPD, and diabetes who
presented to an OSH with worsening shortness of breath, hoarse
voice, inability to lie flat, non-productive cough, and
increasing swelling of his bilateral upper extremities and neck.
He notes for the past 3 weeks or so, he has noticed increasing
shortness of breath and orthopnea, with an increasing number of
pillows at night; he now sleeps only in a sitting position. He
has noticed a change in the quality of his voice. In addition,
his neck and face have been "swelling up". He initially
presented to an OSH in [**State 1727**], where a CT neck demonstrated
mediastinal lymphadenopathy, a 4mm trachea likely secondary to
extrinsic compression, and multiple pulmonary nodules (the
largest of which was 1.5cm in diameter). He was transferred to
[**Hospital 1727**] Medical Center for further workup, where compression of
the SVC was revealed. He was seen by ENT, who noted bilateral
immobile vocal cords fixed in the paramedial/medial position, as
well as an 80% subglottic stenosis. He was noted to have
intraperitoneal air, which was deemed non-surgical and benign by
the consulting surgery team. Radiation oncology was also
consulted, and they recommended XRT after treatment of his SVC
syndrome and tracheal compression. He was referred to [**Hospital1 18**] for
tracheal Y-stenting, SVC stenting, and transbronchial biopsy of
the mediastinal lymphadenopathy.

[**2179-12-12**]: CXR - FINDINGS:
Compared to the prior study, there is no new consolidation and
the pulmonary vascular markings are within normal limits.
Diminished linear atelectatic changes at left base are noted.
IMPRESSION:
No significant interval change vs. prior.


Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the medical ICU on transfer from
[**Hospital 1727**] Medical Center for monitring peri-procedure.
Interventional Pulmonary placed a Y-stent and Interventional
Radiology placed an SVC stent. The procedures went well.  The
Y-stent placement was complicated by a small left lower
pneumothorax. A chest tube with a pig-tail catheter was placed.
This was placed on water seal and showed no re-expansion. The
pigtail catheter was removed and there is no residual PTX and no
leak as evidenced by repeat chest film.

The interventional Pulmonary attending is named [**Name (NI) 828**] [**Name (NI) 829**]

When removing the bialteral femoral lines, there was unexpected
bleeding approx 30 minutes after the right SVC-stent introducer
catheter was removed. The line was pulled, and no bleeding was
noted.  However, upon sitting up and eating, blood was noticed
oozing from the wound site. Pressure was held and his Hct was
stable. No further complications were noted.

The patient suffered acute renal failure felt secondary to
contrast nephropathy as a result of multiple contrast studies.
His Creatinine stabilized @ 3.2 and he continued to make urine.
Renal was consulted and felt dialysis was not needed and that
his kidneys should continue to improve gradually.

Surgery was notified of the CT finding of marked bowel wall gas
and free air under the diaphragm. He was asymptomatic and
tolerating a diet. They felt this was [**Last Name (un) 17066**] issue without clear
etiology. They felt a diet as tolerated and bowel regemine were
indicated and close monitoring.

The following recommendations are made regarding his ongoing
care:
Oncology input once the pathology of the tumor is identified
regarding treatment
Tapering of his steroids
He is to continue on his Aeroslized N-Acetyl Cysteine and normal
saline nebs
continued monitoring of his abdominal exams
