History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 75 y/o male with a h/o rheumatic heart disase,
severe AS, HTN, and hyperlipidemia who presented initially to an
OSH ED with severe SOB and was then transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED
when there was a concern for possible STEMI. Of note, the pt
recently had left carotid stenting on [**2158-10-4**]. Post-procedure,
he was instructed to keep his BP 110-170, taking Sudafed at home
if his BP decreased. About 2-3 days after his procedure, he
noted increasing SOB and DOE. He denied any CP. He presented to
[**Hospital1 1474**] ED with the above complaints. He was started on a nitro
gtt and given combivent nebs, Lasix 80 IV x 1, solumedrol 125 mg
IV x 1, ativan 1 mg IV x 1, morphine 4 mg IV x 1, ASA 325 mg PO,
and Lopressor 5 mg IV x 1. Because of his respiratory distress,
he was placed on BiPAP 18/5. A non-contrast CT scan was
performed to r/o aortic dissection. It revealed moderate B/L
pleural effusions. She was then transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED for
further evaluation.

OSH vitals on presentation: BP 146/80 HR 80 RR 16 100% on BiPap.
Question of STE on EKG, CPK 521, Troponin 23.4, BNP 1328, and
WBC 21. At the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, he was started on a heparin gtt. Vitals
on presentation were T 98.5 HR 76 BP 112/69 RR 12 92% 4LNC.

Of note, after his carotid stenting procedure, he developed a
new rash on his trunk. He was treated with prednisone, thought
to be [**1-7**] to dye allergy.

CATH [**10-16**]:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Moderate-to-severe aortic stenosis.
3. Marked elevation of biventricular filling pressures.

ECHO [**10-16**]:
Suboptimal image quality. LV wall thicknesses are normal.
Regional LV systolic dysfunction consistent with coronary artery
disease. Diastolic dysfunction. There is aortic stenosis which
is at least moderate and may be severe (valve not well seen and
Doppler interrogation only possible from suprasternal view). The
mitral valve is not well seen but does not appear to be
rheumatic, there is no mitral stenosis. Moderate pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension.

CXR [**10-16**]:
1. Bilateral atelectasis and retrocardiac opacities, for which
repeat PA and lateral were recommended if there is concern for
aspiration or pneumonia.
2. Pulmonary edema.

CXR PA/LAT [**10-18**]:
1. Small left pleural effusion.
2. No pneumonia. No CHF.

VENOUS MAPPING [**10-18**]:
Patent bilateral greater saphenous veins with very large
diameters on the right and small diameters on the left.

Brief Hospital Course:
75 y/o male with a h/o rheumatic heart disase, severe AS, HTN,
and hyperlipidemia who presented with worsening SOB, determined
to have a NSTEMI and left sided heart failure.

NSTEMI/left-sided heart failure - Pt presented to OSH with
worsening SOB, without CP, and responded fairly wellthought to
have had plaque rupture, resulting in ischemia and diastolic
dysfunction, and in the setting of fixed AS developed pulmonary
edema. Pt was medically managed with Aspirin 325mg, plavix 75mg,
lipitor 80mg and heparin drip. Beta-blocker was initially held.

Pt underwent cardiac catheterization which showed: 1. Three
vessel coronary artery disease. 2. Moderate-to-severe aortic
stenosis. 3. Marked elevation of biventricular filling
pressures.  Based on these findings, recommendation was made to
undergo CABG with AVR once recovered from recent carotid stents.
Pt agreed and underwent screening by CT [**Doctor First Name **] as well as multiple
pre-op studies and dental work (removal of two teeth). Cardiac
enzymes continued to trend down and pt was discharged home to
continue course of plavix, to be stopped 4 days prior to
surgery.

HYPERTENSION - Initially held beta-blocker and ACE-inhibitor and
restarted once renal function improved and CHF better
controlled.

HYPERLIPIDEMIA - Pt switched to Lipitor 80 mg in the acute
setting (on Zocor as outpatient).

S/P LEFT CAROTID STENT - Pt had history of stroke/TIA, but had
persistently normal neuro exams throughout the admission.

Otherwise stable, ambulating, and pain free.  Six hours after

Discharge Instructions:
You had a heart attack and some fluid accumulated in your lungs
because your heart was not working well. You had a cardiac
catheterization which showed severe aortic stenosis (a stiff
arotic valve in your heart) and blockages in 3 of your arteries
that feed blood to your heart. You will need surgery to bypass
these arteries and fix your aortic valve. A tooth was pulled in
preperation for the surgery. You had evidence of bacteria in
your urine that needs treatment.  You should complete a 7 day
course of amoxacillin for thi
