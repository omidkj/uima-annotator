Chief Complaint:
transfer from OSH

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
tracheoplasty [**2103-10-19**]
tracheostomy [**2103-10-22**]

History of Present Illness:
69M with severe tracheobronchial malacia transferred from OSH
for evaluation for possible surgical intervention for definitive
tracheal modification.

Patient was initially admitted from home to OSH ([**Location (un) 8117**], NH)
[**2103-9-19**] for fatigue, dehydration and several week h/o daily
diarrhea and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] [**2103-10-3**].  Prior to his
admission on [**2103-9-19**], the patient was at a rehab facility from
early [**8-22**] to [**2103-9-6**] where he was being treated for a PNA
with Vancomycin and for a UTI with Ciprofloxacin.  Given recent
courses of antibiotics, patient was treated empirically with
flagyl for possible c.diff, but this was later d/c'd when stool
cultures returned negative for c. diff x1.  Diarrhea resolved
during most of his hospitalization in [**Location (un) 8117**], but restarted one
day prior to transfer.

Patient reports that he has been having a non-productive cough
at home associated with worsening shortness of breath.  He
denied fevers and chills.  No associated
CP/palpitations/N/V/diaphoresis.  CXR and Chest CT at OSH
revealed new R pleural effusion, but no evidence of infiltrate
suggestive of PNA.  Patient was s/p diagnostic thoracentesis
[**2103-10-1**].  Preliminiary results: Glucose 68, LDH 1106, TProt
5.4.  Thoracentesis was complicated by AFib with RVR that was
rate controlled with Diltiazem.  Patient later spontaneously
converted to sinus rhythm.

On transfer to [**Hospital1 18**], patient with no specific complaints.
Reported that respiratory status was close to baseline, but
perhaps a little worse.  He felt comfortable, denied chest
pain/abdominal pain and baseline appetite.  He noted 1 episode
of diarrhea one day prior to transfer.

STUDIES:

report sent separately.

[**2103-10-5**] CXR:
PORTABLE AP CHEST RADIOGRAPH: There are poor inspiratory lung
volumes, with pulmonary vascular crowding. The cardiac and
mediastinal contours are stable. There is a tortuous aorta. No
pneumothorax is seen. There is slight elevation of the right
hemidiaphragm which is unchanged from the prior study.
Additionally, there may be minimal blunting of the right
costophrenic angle. There is limited evaluation of the trachea
and bronchus, likely due to technical factors. A stent can be
seen within the main trachea, however, the distal extent of this
into the bronchi is not visualized on this exam.

IMPRESSION: Mild residue which cleared with repeated swallows.
Trace penetration with no aspiration.

[**2103-10-9**] CHEST CT:
IMPRESSION:
1. Tracheal stent extending from the thoracic inlet down into
the left main stem bronchus.
2. Right lower lobe atelectasis.

10cc Bloody fluid collected, NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.
Histiocytes and blood.

[**2103-10-11**] CXR:
Since the previous exam, the tracheobronchial stent has been
removed. The trachea above the carina shows narrowing. There are
bilateral small pleural effusions. There is also pleural
thickening along the lateral chest wall. The lungs are clear.
There is slight asymmetric aeration of the lungs, which may be
due to air-trapping.
IMPRESSION: Bilateral small pleural effusions, right greater,
and narrowing of the distal trachea.

Brief Hospital Course:
69M with severe tracheobronchial malacia here for surgical
evaluation.

#.  Tracheobronchial malacia- Awaiting eval and input from Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 952**] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]. Per IP 2 tracheobronchial metal stents
were placed on [**10-5**], initially thought stents would improve
breathing. Stents were followed with serial CXR and chest CT
which showed no migration or stents. However, pt had persistent
cough without releif with atrovent nebs, lidocaine IH, and
guafenesin. On [**10-10**] metal stents were removed per IP for
symptomatic relief of persistent cough.  CT [**Doctor First Name **] followed pt
throughout course of hospitalization. Atrovent nebs qid, ativan
qhs, guaifenesin prn, and lidocaine nebs PRN per respiratory
were continued.

[**2103-10-19**]: Patient was transferred to the thoracic surgery service
and underwent a tracheoplasty for his tracheobronchial malacia.
Postoperatively, he was transferred to the ICU intubated.  He
was restarted on his heparin drip immediately postoperatively.
He remained stable overnight and was given intermittent fluid
for low blood pressures. Pain was controlled using an epidural.
POD #1-Bronchoscopy was performed on POD #1 and the patient was
extubated. On the evening of POD #1, patient became less alert
with desaturations despite supplemental oxygen. His creatinine
also increased despite gentle fluid resuscitation. Anesthesia
was called for increasing desaturations and the patient was
reintubated at the bedside without complication.
POD #2-Patient maintained on mechanical ventilation, remained
stable throughout the day.
POD #3-Patient stable on a low neosynephrine drip. He went back
to the operating room for an uncomplicated tracheostomy.
Postoperatively, patient was noted to be unresponsive despite
weaning of his anesthetics as well as hypoxic to the low 80's
despite mechanical ventilation via his tracheostomy. He
experienced episodes of ventricular tachycardia treated with
amiodarone and lidocaine. Laboratory values at this time
demonstrated the patient to be severely acidemic with a
bicarbonate of 16 as well as an arterial pH of 7.12. The patient
was given bicarbonate supplementation and aggressively
ventilated. At this time, the patient remained unresponsive with
unequal pupils on exam. He continued to deteriorate with
decreasing urine output, continuing acidemia, and elevated
transaminases to >1000. A Swan Ganz catheter was placed at the
bedside and the patient's pulmonary artery pressures were noted
to be markedly elevated. A stat echocardio
