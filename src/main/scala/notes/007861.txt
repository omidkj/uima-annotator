CHEST (PORTABLE AP)

Reason: r/o infiltrate

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
61 year old man with large decub, sepsis
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
r/o infiltrate
AP PORTABLE CHEST, [**2179-9-25**] AT 18:53 HOURS.

HISTORY: Large decubitus ulcers and sepsis.

COMPARISON: Multiple priors, the most recent dated [**2179-8-31**].

FINDINGS: The patient is rotated. This study is further limited
by body habitus. No gross consolidation or superimposed edema is
evident. Small bilateral pleural effusions cannot be entirely
excluded as costophrenic angles are blunted. No large effusion
is evident. There is no pneumothorax. Again noted are changes
consistent with prior median sternotomy and CABG. The more
cephalad sternal wires remain fractured, but linearly aligned.

IMPRESSION: Limited exam as above. No gross consolidation or
failure noted. Likely small bilateral pleural effusions.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Name14 (STitle) 92811**] was transferred from the emergency department to
the SICU for ongoing care of his bleeding, sepsis, and large
ulcer.   In the SICU he was started on antibiotics(zosyn and
linezolid), given blood transfusions, and the bleeding from his
ulcer was controlled with cautery and pressure.  He was seen by
cardiology who recommended perioperative beta-blockade, statin,
diuresis, and to keep his hematocrit greater than 30.  Due to
the proximity of his ulcer to his rectum he was taken to the
operating room with the general surgery service on [**2179-9-29**] for a
colostomy to divert stool away from the wound.  Please see their
full Op-Note for details. He tolerated the procedure well and
was transferred back to the SICU post-operatively.  On [**2179-10-2**]
he was taken to the operating room with the plastic surgery team
for debriedment of his ulcer.  Again, see the above Op-note for
full details.  He again tolerated the procedure well.  Of note
he is not a candidate for flap closure due to the large size of
the ulcer.  Post-operatively he was noted to have low UOP and
was treated with fluid boluses for this.  While in house he was
also seen by the ostomy service who had difficulty securing his
appliance.  Currently they are using a large [**Location (un) **] with [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]
[**Last Name (un) **] seal and also Coloplast paste strip.  They also recommend
Skin Bond Cement if this does not hold. He does have a rectal
tube in place for containment of his residual stool. He was
transferred to the floor on [**2179-10-5**] in stable condition.  The
decision was made that his ulcer requires no further debriedment
and he was transferred back to acute care rehab on [**2179-10-6**] in
stable condition.  Of note, on the day of discharge the patient
was AOx3, involved in his care, and voiced understanding of his
condition.  He was able to tolerate daily dressing changes with
wet-to-dry curlex without difficulty.
