HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:   Mr. [**Known lastname 1683**] is a 57 year old
white male with a past medical history significant for HIV
diagnosed in [**2115**] with a CD-4 count of 340 with a viral load
of 364,000, in intermittent HAART therapy with non-compliance
in the past two months, childhood epilepsy, qestionable
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and dysphagia secondary
to hypertrophied cricopharyngeal muscle, who was transferred
to [**Hospital1 69**] from [**Hospital6 3426**] with anemia, acute renal failure, hypoxic
respiratory failure and respiratory distress resulting in
emergent intubation.

The patient initially presented with Infectious Disease
Clinic with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] on [**12-27**] and the patient was found to
have a low hematocrit to 21.8 to a norm of 44.  Decrased
platelets were to 88 from a norm of 158.  The patient was
called the next day and directed to go the nearest Emergency
Department for further work-up.

On admission, the patient's hematocrit was noted to be 18
with a creatinine of 4.2.

On review of systems, the patient is reporting increased
fatigue, weakness and muscle aches times three months,
positive headaches status post recent fall with mild head
trauma, no loss of consciousness.  At [**Hospital6 33**],
the patient was transfused to a hematocrit of 27.  GTP was
ruled out with negative shistocytes on smear.  The patient
was found to be hypoxic on hospital day number two and an
arterial blood gases of 7.48, 28 and 55 on room air, and was
intubated.  The patient was found to have bilateral
infiltrates on chest x-ray likely secondary to infection
versus congestive heart failure.

The patient has a left femoral Quinton catheter placed on
[**1-1**] and hemodialysis was initiated with significant
improvement in ventilation and oxygenation.  Subsequently,
the patient's hematocrit dropped again from 27 to 17.
Abdominal and pelvic CT scan was done on [**1-3**] revealing a
large retroperitoneal hematoma 9 by 7 centimeters.  The
patient remained hemodynamically stable and was transfused to
a hematocrit of 24 on transfer.

At [**Hospital1 69**], the patient was
started on treatment for empiric PCP and community acquired
pneumonia with Bactrim.  The only positive cultures included
Methicillin sensitivie Staphylococcus aureus in
nasopharyungeal swabs and positive [**Female First Name (un) 564**] in sputum.  On
[**12-29**] yeast.  On [**12-30**] blood cultures for Legionella, PCP,
[**Name10 (NameIs) **], CMV, Hepatitis B and parvo virus were all negative.
Prednisone was started secondary to the patient's low PAO2.
Cardiac, the patient had a CK of 147, MB 14.5, troponin 0.5,
no acute ischemia was appreciated on the EKG.

The patient had an echocardiogram on [**12-28**] with an ejection
fraction of 45 to 50% with inferior mild hypokinesis.  No
pulmonary hypertension, with normal left ventricular size.
One plus mitral regurgitation and tricuspid regurgitation.
The patient was then transferred to vent setting.  The
patient with no spontaneous respirations on [**12-24**], PEEP of
22.  The patient was total volume of 600 by 12, 60%.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:   On examination, the patient had a
temperature of 98.0 F.; blood pressure 156/80; pulse 64;
respirations 12; saturation of 100% on aforementioned
ventilator settings.  Generally, the patient was pale,
cachectic, chronically ill appearing and looking older than
stated age, grimcing to noxious stimuli.  HEENT:  Pupils are
equal, round and reactive to light.  Extraocular muscles are
intact.  Anciterc sclerae.  Oropharynx with mild thrush.  No
epistaxis.  Neck:  The patient had a right IJ.  Lungs:  The
patient had high pitched bronchial breath sounds in the right
lower lobe.  Otherwise clear bilaterally with no crackls and
no wheezing.  Cardiovascular is regular rate and rhythm with
a II/VI systolic ejection murmur best appreciated in the left
upper sternal border.  Abdominal examination:  The patient
was mildly distended, soft, no masses, with some flank
fullness, right greater than left with a persistent area of
ecchymosis.  Extremities with no cyanosis, clubbing or edema.
No rashes or bruises.  Warm and good pulses throughout.
Neurological:  Toes were downgoing bilaterally, one plus deep
tendon reflexes throughout.  Rectal:  The patient was guiac
negative.

LABORATORY:  On admission, white blood cell count of 4.6,
hematocrit of 25.7, platelets of less than 40.  Coagulation
studies were PT 12.9, PTT 25, INR 1.1.  Chem 7 was sodium of
143, potassium of 4.2, chloride 107, bicarbonate 24, BUN of
40, creatinine of 4.8, glucose of 92, calcium of 8.7,
magnesium 2.1, phosphorus 5.2.  D-dimer greater than [**2122**].
Fibrinogen 338.  CK and troponin were negative.

Urinalysis with large blood, 100 protein, 100 glucose.

ASSESSMENT:   The patient was admitted to the Medical
Intensive Care Unit at [**Hospital1 69**]
with issues of:  1) Anemia; 2) hypoxia; 3) acute renal
failure.
1.  Anemia:  The patient was transfused a total of 11 units
of packed red blood cells at [**Hospital6 33**].  He was
found to have a retroperitoneal bleed on [**1-1**] secondary to
dialysis catheter placement dropping the patient's
hematocrit.
2.  Acute renal failure:  Hemodialysis was initiated.  The
patient had a creatinine of 4.2.
3.  Infectious Disease:  The patient was treated for
community acquired pneumonia.  The patient was started on
Bactgrim, Zithromax, Ceftriaxone.
4.  Pulmonary:  The patient was intubated secondary to
hypoxia and respiratory distress.

On admission, the patient's admission hematocrit was 25.2.
The patient was transfused 4 units of packed red blood cells
and appropriately bumped to a hematocrit of 34.9.  The
patient's acute renal failure was thought to be new.  A renal
consultation was obtained.  The patient arrived intubated.
The patient had a bronchoscopy on [**2125-1-6**] showing copious
thick secretions and on [**1-7**], showing a decrease in
patient's secetions.  The patient had a head CT scan on [**1-5**]
which was negative for bleed.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  PULMONARY:  On patient's head CT scan the patient was
found to have sinusitis and the patient was found to have
infiltrate on chest x-ray and unclear whether secondary to
congestive heart failure versus infection.  In light of this
and the patient's sinusitis, the patient was started on a 14
day course of Zosyn. The patient remained clnically
successfully intubated in Intensive Care Unit.  The patient's
respiratory status continued to immprove and the patient
remained clinically stable until the morning of [**2125-1-22**],
when he was found to be in respiratory distress and
tachypenic.

The chest x-ray showed a right sided opacity in the patient's
right lung.   The patient was asymptomatic at this time and
afebrile.  The patient was felt to be in frank pulmonary
edema secondary to patient's hypertension.  The patient was
placed on a Labetolol drip and Hydralazine.  The patient's
subsequently improved after hemodialysis
