Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1042**]
Chief Complaint:
hypoxia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
1. Intubation and extubation


History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **] yo F with h/o CAD s/p CABG, diastolic CHF (EF 55%), HTN, and
mild AS who presents with worsening SOB X 4-5 days. The patient
was recently hospitalized earlier this month for similar
complaints and was found to have a CHF exacerbation which was
treated with diuresis. She was discharged on [**12-7**] and has since
adhered to a low sodium diet and taken all of her pills as
prescribed. The pt began to notice SOB approximately 4-5 days
ago which was followed by increased fatigue and poor appetite
since Friday. This was accompanied by subjective fevers, chills,
and a productive cough of whitish sputum. The pt denies travel,
sick contacts, and other localizing symptoms including dysuria,
diarrhea, and abdominal pain.
.
In the ED, the pt was initially hypoxic to the 65% on RA and
improved to 100% on NRB. CXR showed a mod to large sized
loculated R pleural effusion that was unchanged from [**12-7**]. EKG
was without new ischemic changes, cardiac enzymes negative, BNP
6244. She received levaquin 750 mg IV X 1, CTX 1 g IV X 1,
tylenol 1 gm po (for temp to 101.8), lasix 40 IV then 80 IV with
subsequent 130 ccs of urine output. She was taken off a NRB and
placed on a ventimask sating 98%. She was then admitted to the
[**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for further care.
.
On ROS, denies PND, LE edema, sleeps flat with one pillow at
night but does feel less SOB sitting up. + back pain, which has
since resolved. + CP without oxygen on. + occasional dysphagia
with solids, no recent reported aspiration event.

EKG: NSR @ 70 bpm, LAD, nl intervals, T wave flattening V6, I,
aVL, II, III, aVF, poor R wave progression
.
IMAGING:
Port CXR [**12-28**] - Lungs demonstrates moderate-to-large loculated
right
pleural effusion and adjacent atelectasis, not significantly
changed in appearance from [**2132-12-7**].  The
cardiomediastinal contour is stable.  No pneumothorax is
detected.  Median sternotomy wires are redemonstrated.
IMPRESSION:  Moderate-to-large loculated right-sided effusion
and adjacent atelectasis.  Underlying consolidation not
excluded.
.
TTE [**6-8**] - The left atrium is dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated. The estimated right atrial pressure is [**4-11**]
mmHg. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The
left ventricular cavity size is normal. Due to suboptimal
technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be
fully excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
normal (LVEF 70%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. There are focal calcifications in the aortic
arch. The number of aortic valve leaflets cannot be determined.
The aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is
mild aortic valve stenosis (area 1.2-1.9cm2). No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. There is severe
mitral annular calcification. At least moderate (2+) mitral
regurgitation is present. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the
severity of mitral regurgitation may be significantly
UNDERestimated.] There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

CT CHEST W/O CONTRAST  [**2133-1-3**] 1:47 PM

CT CHEST W/O CONTRAST

Reason: Evaluate pleural effusions

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
[**Age over 90 **] year old woman with bilateral pleural effusions, possibly
thought to be loculated on plain film, for the last month,
diastolic CHF, CAD, HTN, and h/o breast cancer s/p lumpectomy
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
Evaluate pleural effusions
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.

CLINICAL INDICATION: [**Age over 90 **]-year-old woman with bilateral pleural
effusions, possibly loculated on plain films, and history of
breast cancer status post lumpectomy. Evaluate pleural
effusions.

COMPARISON: Multiple chest x-rays, the most recent one performed
[**2133-1-2**], and CT Chest performed [**11-5**] and [**6-7**].

TECHNIQUE: CT of the chest was performed without IV contrast.

CT CHEST WITH CONTRAST: A 1.7 cm right thyroid nodule is similar
appearance to [**2130-9-28**]. Post-CABG changes are noted.

There is a small right sided pleural effusion. Thickened pleura
is seen anteriorly and posteriorly along the most inferior
portions of the posterior right lower lobe effusion (5:55). This
component of the effusion appears predominantly layering. There
are small areas of loculation posterior and anterior (13:45) to
the right right upper lobe.

Debris is noted within the right bronchus intermedius upstream
to a new 3.0 x 7.1 cm (5:49) area of consolidation in the right
lower lobe. This may represent consolidation secondary to
aspiration pneumonia, although neoplastic process cannot be
excluded. A similar appearing region of consolidation is also
seen in the right middle lobe, measuring 3.4 x 1.9 cm (5:42). 7
mm calcified nodule is also noted in the right middle lobe,
similar to prior study of 7/[**2130**].

A 1.3-cm calcified left paratracheal lymph node is similar
appearance to prior studies. There are no pathologically
enlarged mediastinal, hilar, or axillary lymph nodes. The
brachiocephalic artery is mildly dilated, unchanged since
[**2130-9-28**].

Bone windows demonstrate no suspicious lytic or blastic lesions.
Old right T11 rib fracture noted.

The visualized portions of the upper abdomen again demonstrate
calcified granuloma within the dome of the liver. A 2.1 x 1.6 cm
right adrenal nodule measuring 35 Hounsfield units in
attenuation, not scanned on prior imaging, does not meet CT
criteria for adenoma.

IMPRESSION:

1. A debris-filled right bronchus intermedius upstream to areas
of consolidation may represent aspiration pneumonia, although a
neoplastic process cannot be excluded in the right lower lobe.
Followup to resolution recommended.

2. Right pleural effusion, with minimal loculated component, as
noted above. There appears to be a thickened rind at the
parietal pleura of the inferior right hemithorax.

3. Right adrenal nodule measuring 2.1 x 1.6 cm does not meet
criteria for adenoma. Recommend MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles)
