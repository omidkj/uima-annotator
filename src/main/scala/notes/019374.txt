Service: NEUROSURGERY

Allergies:

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1835**]
Chief Complaint:
Transfer from OSH for SDH with shift


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**1-4**]:Rt Craniotomy for SDH
[**1-9**]: trach/peg placement


History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 72 year old man with a history of
hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and IDDM who is s/p fall yesterday
with right sided headache, transferred from OSH with right SDH
with right to left midline shift. The history is obtained from
EMS and the medical records. At approximately 9:00 pm yesterday,
the patient fell and his his head while walking to the bathroom.
There was no reported LOC. He has had a right sided headache
since the fall. After falling, he watched TV and then went to
bed. This morning, he attempted to get up to urinate but was too
weak to walk to the bathroom requiring him to sit on the floor.
Per the OSH records, his right leg was weaker than the left (but
? if this is chronic). His wife was concerned and called EMS.

He initially went to [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 47**], where bp on admission
was 179/79 but peaked at 200/109. Neurological exam was "alert
and oriented x3, cranial and cerebellar functions normal, lower
extremities are somewhat weaker than upper extremities but no
focal deficits." Labs showed WBC 13.8, Hct 37.6, plt 231, CK 69,
Trop T 0.02, Na 145, Cr 1.7, glucose 187, INR 1.0. CT Head
showed
"large right frontal subdural with mass effect." He was
intubated
prophylactically, and given Lidocaine 100 mg IV, etomidate 20 mg
IV, vecuronium 10 mg IV. He was also given Mannitol 120 gm IV,
Fosphenytoin 1 gm IV, and Ativan 2 mg IV x2. He was transferred
to [**Hospital1 18**].

Blood pressure on admission to [**Hospital1 18**] was 214/93, and he was
started on a Propofol gtt. CXR showed a PNA, and he was given
CTX
and azithromycin.

Imaging:
CT head [**1-4**]:
IMPRESSION:
Extensive subdural hemorrhage involving the interhemispheric
fissure and right cerebral convexity and layering along the
right tentorium. Approximately 9 mm of leftward midline shift
demonstrated. No hydrocephalus or evidence of intraventricular
spread of hemorrhagic products.

CTA Head [**1-5**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. Stable post-craniotomy change with evolution of right frontal

intraparenchymal hemorrhage and associated edema. Alternatively,
hypodensity could be related to venous ischemia. Although the
dural venous sinuses and deep cortical veins appear patent
without thrombosis, MRI is more sensitive and may be pursued if
there is clinical concern.
2. Stable right cerebellar infarct.

MRV Head [**1-9**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of new hemorrhage or major vascular territory
infarction.
2. Abnormal signal in the right frontoparietal lobe
corresponding to areas of contusion and edema on prior CT.
Slight increase in edema compared to the prior, consistent with
evolving contusion.
3. Abnormal diffusion in the corpus callosum and left internal
capsule
consistent with diffuse axonal injury.
4. No evidence of cerebral venous thrombosis.

MRI C-Spine [**1-9**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of acute cervical spine ligamentous or cord
injury or
intradural abnormality.
2. Degenerative disc, endplate and facet joint disease, as
described above, with likely impingement on the exiting

MRI Head [**1-9**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of new hemorrhage or major vascular territory
infarction.
2. Abnormal signal in the right frontoparietal lobe
corresponding to areas of contusion and edema on prior CT.
Slight increase in edema compared to the prior, consistent with
evolving contusion.
3. Abnormal diffusion in the corpus callosum and left internal
capsule
consistent with diffuse axonal injury.
4. No evidence of cerebral venous thrombosis.

EEG [**1-8**]:
IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal portable EEG recording due to
the slow
and disorganized background suggestive of a severe
encephalopathy.
Metabollic disturbance, medication and infection are among the
most
common causes. There were no lateralized or epileptiform
features seen
in this recording, however the markedly generalized slowing
could
obscure some of the focal findings.

LENIS [**1-21**]:
IMPRESSION: No deep venous thrombosis in the right lower
extremity.
Extremely limited exam of the left lower extremity with no
evidence of
thrombosis of left CFV,SFV and popliteal veins but possible
nonocclusive clot in the left tibial veins.

LENIS [**1-25**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of deep venous thrombosis in the left lower
extremity.
2. Left calf subcutaneous edema.

Head CT [**1-28**]:
IMPRESSION: No significant change in subdural and subarachnoid
hemorrahge,
and mass effect, compared to three days prior. No evidence of
new hemorrhage.

CT Chest/Abdomen/Pelvis:
IMPRESSION:
1. No clearly infectious process is identified in the torso.
2. There are areas of mild atelectasis in the lungs.
3. 4-5 mm nodule in the right upper lobe. Consider CT followup
in one years' time, if there is a history of smoking risk
factors for lung malignancy, or a history of primary malignancy.

4. Right renal cyst.

CXR [**1-20**]:
FINDINGS: Comparison is made to previous study from [**2153-1-15**].
There is a left-sided PICC line whose distal lead tip is seen to
the level of the mid SVC. There is no pneumothoraces; however,
the left apex has been slightly excluded from the study. There
is a left retrocardiac opacity.


Brief Hospital Course:
72 year old man with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia,
and IDDM who is s/p fall on [**1-3**] (no LOC, with R sided HA).  In
the am the next day, he awoke with difficulty getting out of bed
and weakness L>R.  He presented to OSH ED
where he was found to have R SDH with L ML shift.  He was
transferred to
