Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1505**]
Chief Complaint:
Lightheadedness

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2170-1-4**] - 1. Mitral valve repair with resection of the middle
scallop posterior leaflet, and a mitral valve annuloplasty with
a 28 mm Physio II annuloplasty ring. 2. Modified left-sided maze
procedure. 3. Left [**Month/Day/Year **] appendage resection.
[**2170-1-4**] - Re-Exploration for Bleeding


History of Present Illness:
70 year old female with history of a heart murmur since the age
of 30 however had not had an echocardiogram until this past
[**Month (only) **]. Recently she has developed palpitations,
lightheadedness and chest discomfort. An EKG this past [**2169-8-3**] was abnormal and she was sent on for a stress test. This
was
nondiagnostic for ischemia however did suggest signficant mitral
regurgitation. An echocardiogram was performed which revealed
moderate to severe mitral regurgitation in the setting of a
normal ejection fraction. PA pressures were not noted. She
continues to note occassional chest discomfort, racing heart and
dyspnea with exertion. She does have what seems to be [**Year (4 digits) 19598**]
[**Year (4 digits) **] fibrillation. She was originally seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in
[**Month (only) 1096**] and was sent for a transesophageal echocardiogram which
was done [**2169-12-11**]. This revealed moderate to severe (3+) mitral
regurgitation with bileaflet prolapse. Given her worsening
symptoms and significance of her a mitral valve regurgitation,
she has been refered for surgical management.

Pertinent Results:
ECHO [**2170-1-4**]
Prebypass

No [**Month/Day/Year **] septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left
ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. Regional left
ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). [Intrinsic left
ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the
severity of valvular regurgitation.] Right ventricular chamber
size and free wall motion are normal. There are three aortic
valve leaflets. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are myxomatous.
There is moderate/severe anterior and posterior leaflet mitral
valve prolapse. The posterior mitral leaflet is long. Moderate
(2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial
effusion. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in person of the results on
[**2170-1-4**] at 830 am.

Post bypass

Patient is A paced and receiving an infusion of phenylephrine.
Annuloplasty ring seen in the mitral position. It appears well
seated. There is trivial to mild mitral regurgitation. There is
some turbulence seen in the LVOT. No significant gradient
demonstrated in the LVOT. Aorta is intact post decannulation.
Biventricular systolic function is unchanged.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2170-1-4**] for surgical
management of her mitral valve disease. She was taken to the
operating room where she underwent a  Mitral valve repair with
resection of the middle scallop posterior leaflet, and a mitral
valve annuloplasty with  a 28 mm Physio II annuloplasty
ring/Modified left-sided maze procedure/ Left [**Date Range **] appendage
resection with Dr.[**Last Name (STitle) **].She tolerated the procedure well and
was transferred to the CVICI intubated and sedated. Six
hours status post mitral valve repair and left [**Last Name (STitle) **] appendage
resection and a Maze procedure, was noted to have excessive
drainage from her chest tube.  She remained
hemodynamically stable.  She was taken back for Mediastinal
re-exploration/ Evacuation of hematoma/ Repair of left [**Last Name (STitle) **]
appendage bleeder. Please see operative note for details.
Postoperatively she was taken to the intensive care unit for
monitoring.  Over the next several hours she awoke
neurologically intact and was extubated. All lines and drains
were discontinued per protocol. POD#1 she was in
[**Last Name (STitle) **] fibrillation with fluctuating Blood Pressure. Decision
made to DCCV at 1AM with sinus bradycardia and hypotension
post-DCCV. She was atrially paced at via external leads with
stable BP on Nitroglycerine. She was later weaned off NTG and
did not further require [**Last Name (STitle) **] pacing. Pacing wires were removed
per protocol. Beta blocker was not initiated to allow her
conduction system recovery, as she remained in a 1st degree AV
block. She was placed on Amiodarone for [**Last Name (STitle) 19598**] [**Last Name (STitle) **]
fibrillation, along with anticoagulation with Coumadin. She was
later transferred to the step down unit for further recovery.
Mrs. [**Known lastname **] was gently diuresed towards her preoperative
weight. Ace-Inhibitor was started for blood pressure control.
The physical therapy service was consulted for evaluation with
her postoperative strength and mobility. The remainder of her
postoperative course was essentially uneventful. She continued
to progress and was cleared for discharge to home on POD# 5 with
VNA services. All follow up appointments were advised.
