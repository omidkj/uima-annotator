in the past but has agreed to CABG at this time.  He had
positive troponins, no real EKG changes, no chest pain (just
presented with SOB).  Pt was evaluated by CT surgery in-house,
and surgery is tentatively scheduled for [**12-5**].  TTE report was
obtained prior to surgery (EF=55%), UA was negative, and CXR was
within normal limits. As per TTE reports, he has mild-moderate
AS that may be intervened upon during CABG.  CK's were cked
until they were flat.  He was continued on his ASA, beta
blocker, ACEI, statin, and isordil.  He remained
asymptomatic/chest pain free prior to CABG.

2.  CHF: pt with EF=55% as per TTE report from [**9-9**], has had
multiple admissions for CHF, on standing lasix, currently seems
euvolemic with clear lungs, no peripheral edema.  Lasix (80 qam,
60 qhs) was continued in-house.

3.  AS: mild-moderate AS, plan for intervention on valve during
CABG (gradient approx 30, AV 3/3 m/s)

4.  Sciatica: pt with positive right straight leg raise, with
pain with ambulation.  Pt achieved good pain relief with
percocet.  He had good rectal tone on exam and no signs of
nerve/cord compression.  He was evaluated by neurology for this
