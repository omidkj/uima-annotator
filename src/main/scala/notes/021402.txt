CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST: There is no intracranial hemorrhage, mass,
shift of normally midline structures, or evidence of acute major
vascular territorial infarct.
Bifrontal atrophy is noted. Minimal periventricular hypodensity
is consistent  with age-related small vessel ischemic changes.
The surrounding osseous structures are unremarkable. Bilateral
ethmoid sinus mucosal thickening is observed.


Brief Hospital Course:
78 year old female with h/o hypercholesterolemia,
hyperparathyrodism and HTN who presented with cough, n/v and was
found to have a sodium of 110 on admission.
.
# Hyponatremia, symptomatic
Renal was consulted, and given the patient's history of poor po
intake, GI losses from emesis, and dehydration, it was felt that
the patient's hyponatremia was due to hypovolemia in the setting
of continued HCTZ use (started in late [**9-9**]), combined with
decreased solid food intake, while continuing to drink signif
water. Her HCTZ was discontinued, she was hydrated with 3+L of
NS and was admitted to the medical floor. She was subsequently
transferred to the ICU to initiate 3% saline gtt, as her sodium
only improved slightly to 112. With 3% saline, her sodium levels
gradually improved, and she returned to the medical floor for
ongoing care.  At the time of discharge her sodium level was 130
and she was allowed to drink to thirst, not forcing excess water
intake. She will no longer take HCTZ and will need
