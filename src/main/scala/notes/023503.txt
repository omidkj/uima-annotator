Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 473**]
Chief Complaint:
Pancreatic head mass

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Whipple procedure, [**2128-8-3**]

History of Present Illness:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 87581**] was a 65 year old woman with no significant past
medical history who was well until approximately one month prior
to admission when she presented with jaundice and weight loss to
an OSH. She initially underwent ERCP at [**Hospital **] hospital with a
plastic stent placed on a stricture but without biopsy due to
her ASA 81mg adily.  She had a CT with visualization of the
stricture as well as with dilation of both the pancreatic and
common bile ducts.

She was subsequently referred to [**Hospital1 18**] for EUS with FNA of the
CBD and pancreas however given her increased jaundice and
pruritis it was thought that her current plastic stent in the
CBD may not be providing adequate biliary drainage.  This was
removed, brushings were taken, and a self expanding metal stent
was placed in the CBD. Patient was discharged on [**7-10**] with
cholestyramine and augmentin.

Since her discharge she continued to have persistent pruritis.
Her urine was reportedly "gold" colored and she is was urinating
about every hour, with frequent burning.  Repeat lab tests
showed increased bilirubin (from 25 to 30). She had insomnia
secondary to the pruritis and urinary frequency. She also had
frequent loose stools, up to [**9-8**] BMs per day.

She was readmitted to [**Hospital1 18**] for another ERCP on [**2128-7-16**] and
scheduled for surgery on [**2128-8-3**].

She returned on [**2128-8-3**] for a Whipple operation.


Past Medical History:
1. Hypertension
2. Ectopic pregnancy
3. Anemia, megalobastic

Social History:
Lives at home with her husband.  Smokes 14 cigarettes per day
for many years; occasional alcohol.  No current drug use or in
past. Retired from work in human resources. Has 2 children and 5
grand children


Family History:
Son with diabetes, type II.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 87581**] was taken to the operating room for a Whipple
procedure and cholecystectomy on [**2128-8-3**].  The operation
proceeded without complication. Please refer to the operative
report for additional details.  Mrs. [**Known lastname 87581**] was sent to the
surgical floor after a brief stay in the PACU.

On the morning of POD 1, Mrs. [**Known lastname 87581**] was afebrile, vitals
stable, alert but minimally oriented, confused and agitated.
Her narcotics were removed from her epidural and overall pain
regimen.  Lab results showed significantly elevated LFTs --
ALT/AST 2229/2919 up from 231/336 the day prior.  Bilirubin was
17.8 up from 13.7.  A serum ammonia level was tested and
returned at 24.  A UTI was suspected based on UA dipstick and
ciprofloxacin was started but stopped the next day after the
urine cx returned no growth and no clinical signs of infection.
Her INR was 1.8 (from 1.9 the day prior) and her potassium was
2.9 (from 3.5 and 4.0 previously).

Over the course of the next few days, the patient was less
agitated but her delirium was persistent with continued
confusion, nonsensical speech and behavior and lack of
orientation.  Her liver function tests, however, were
consistently trending downwards with ALT/AST/TBili from
1590/1450/18.2 (POD 2) to 561/157/14.3 (POD 4) to 117/42/10.8
(POD 9).  Her INR went down to 1.1 on POD 2 and remained at 1.1
on POD 3.  From a electrolyte perspective, she was hypokalemic
post operatively which gradually resolved by POD 8.  Her
potassium levels remained persistently in the low 3s with
interspersed values of 2.6 and 2.8.  Her phosphorous was 2.2 and
1.8 on POD 1 and 2 respectively prior to normalizing to 3.8 and
eventually 3.1 on POD 9.  From a nutritional perspective, she
was transitioned from NPO to sips on POD 4, to clears on POD 5,
to fulls on POD 7 and to a regular diet with pureed consistency
on POD 8.  She tolerated all advances with no emesis, no
apparent nausea or abdominal bloating.  She was taking in low
volumes but more than 400 cc of intake with her dietary
advances.

On the evening of POD 7, the patient was intermittently alert
and oriented with markedly less confusion and able to hold a
sensible conversation with family members as well as members of
the healthcare team.  This waxed and waned into POD 9 where she
was clear most of the day, alert and oriented to person, time
and place though continued to have intermittent nonsensical
thought and speech.  She had several loose bowel movements,
sample sent for c.diff and started on empiric flaygl therapy.

On POD 10, Mrs.[**Known lastname 87583**] confusion returned intermittently,
improved from prior but but she appearing more tired, especially
after getting out of bed with physical therapy and after a 2.5
mg dose of oxycodone. Oxycodone was thereafter removed from her
medication list and replaced solely with tylenol.She had fewer
loose bowel movements.

On the morning of POD 11, Mrs. [**Known lastname 87581**] was mentating, alert but
not entirely oriented but interspersed with nonsensical speech.
Her physical exam was unchanged: the incision was clean, dry and
intact, her abdomen soft, non-tender and with minimal
distention, unchanged from prior exams.  In the early afternoon,
after lunch, Mrs. [**Known lastname 87581**] had a loose bowel movement and was
being cleaned by the nursing staff.  After the conclusion of
this process, her husband who re-entered the room noticed that
the patient was not breathing and was unresponsive.  He alerted
the nursing staff who called a code.  Mrs. [**Known lastname 87581**] was found to
be in PEA arrest, then ventricular fibrillation.  She was
actively coded for 10 minutes prior to regaining a pulse with
chest compressions performed throughout, receiving three shocks,
epinephrine, bicarbonate and vasopressin.  She ultimately
regained a pulse and was transferred to the SICU.

During this process, labs indicated that Mrs.[**Known lastname 87583**]
hematocrit was 11.9 (last checked value was POD 9 at 30.3 and
had remained stable at approximately 30 during her entire
post-op course) and had an INR of >21.  Overall, starting from
the code and overnight, Mrs. [**Known lastname 87581**] received 8 units of blood,
6 units of FFP, and 1 unit of cryoprecipitate.  CT scan done
that night showed a large intraperitoneal bleed, mostly clotted,
with no active extravasation of contrast.  It was decided to
manage her non-operatively with close monitoring with serial
hematocrits, with fluid resuscitation and a low dose neo drip.
She was hemodynamically stable, responding appropriately to the
blood transfusions, with her hematocrit going from
11.9-->13.7-->28.8 overnight.  Initially her bladder pressures
were monitored frequently to monitor for abdominal compartment
syndrome due to an on-going bleed.  Her hematocrit remained
stable in the mid 20s.  Her bladder pressures were normal and
measurements were stopped [**8-18**].

Mrs.[**Known lastname 87583**] time in the SICU was dominated by neurological
and cardiovascular/renal/fluid management issues.  They are
described in detail over her 2 week course in the ICU.

CARDIOVASCULAR/RENAL:
On [**2128-8-15**] she remained hemodynamically stable but her UOP
decreased after finishing transfusions of blood.  The pressors
were titrated accordingly to maintain increased renal perfusion
and urine output.  She was transfused 2units on [**2128-8-16**] to a
post-tx hct of 28.9, her remained stable at INR 1.1, her
pressors were weaned and her Cr was 1.6. Her pressors were
turned off entirely on [**2128-8-17**] and she remained hemodynamically
stable for the next few days and her renal function improved
gradually(1.2 on [**8-17**] to 0.6 on [**8-22**]).

From [**Date range (1) 87584**], Mrs.[**Known lastname 87583**] hemodynamic status started to
worsen again.  She had some low blood pressure issues (SBPs in
the 80s) and low urine output (20 cc/hr, Cr bumped suddenly to
1.
