History of Present Illness:
47yo male w/history of adrenal insufficiency s/p resection of
pituitary tumor p/w hematemisis, weakness, hypotension and Hct
of 14. Patient reports falling approximately 2 days prior to
presentation at which time he struck his back and head. Denies
LOC. Because of continued discomfort from fall, he states that
he was taking between [**8-11**] aspirin/day for the last 2 days as
well as [**2-4**] advil and [**1-3**] tylenol/day. Patient states that last
PM he had epistaxis and hematemsis, which resolved. This AM he
awoke feeling extremely weak, and called his brother, whom
called EMS. The patient was intially hypotensive in route w/SBP
in the 70's, and was found to have a Hct of 14.5 and an INR of
2.3 upon arrival to the ED.  An NG tube was placed and
approximately 500cc of gross blood was suctioned from the
stomache. While in the ED, the patient rcvd 6 units of PRBC, 2
units of FFP, 2 liters of fluid, and 1 unit of cryo. The
patient's BP stabalized and he was transported to the MICU for
continued resucitation and EGD.

Of additional interest, CT of the abdomen showed a small liver
w/gastric and esophageal varices. Labs were significant for a
depressed albumin of 1.7, fibrinogen of 80, and INR of 2.3. Per
patient, there is no history of liver disease.

CT abd from admission [**4-20**]:
CT ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST: In the visualized portion of lower
portion of the right upper lobe there are patchy ground-glass
and centrilobular opacities. The lung bases are clear. The liver
appears slightly small with no focal or textural abnormalities.
The splenic vein. SMV , portal veins, and parthly visulaized
hepatic veins are patent. Collateral umbilical and periumbilical
veins are noted. Small stones are noted within the gallbladder.
The pancreas is somewhat atrophic. The spleen is enlarged. The
adrenal glands appear small. The kidneys are unremarkable.
Prominent gastric and esophageal varices are noted. No definite
contrast extravasation is seen. The stomach is filled with high
density fluid consistent with blood. Small and large bowel loops
are diffusely thickened with abnormal enhancement of the mucosa.
There is no free air. Low attenuation fluid in the abdomen is
consistent with ascites. Prominent portal and retroperitoneal
lymph nodes are noted.

CT PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST: Air and Foley catheter are noted in
the bladder. The prostate and seminal vesicles are unremarkable.
There is diffuse thickening of the wall of the sigmoid colon.
Low attenuation fluid is noted in the pelvis. There is no pelvic
or inguinal lymphadenopathy. A catheter is noted in the right
common femoral vein with an associated small amount of air. O f
note just inferior to the femoral puncture site there is a
hematoma within the adductor muscle. Foci of active
extravasation are noted. Additionally, a small amount of air is
noted in the left common femoral vein extending into the
inferior epigastric.

BONE WINDOWS: There are no suspicious lytic or sclerotic osseous
lesions. No fractures are observed.

IMPRESSION:
1. Portal hypertension and with large gastric, esophageal and
umbilical varices. Splenomegaly. Prominent periportal and
retroperitoneal nodes. Low attenuation fluid consistent with
ascites.
2. Cholelithiasis.
3. Diffusely thickened bowel wall with abnormally enhancing
mucosa. This could be due to hypoproteinemia.
4. Hematoma within the right adductor muscle. The femoral vein
punctures site with foci of active extravasation. Small amounts
of air are noted in both femoral veins.
5. Patchy ground-glass and centrilobular opacities at the base
of the right upper lobe. These findings are nonspecific. If
indicated, further evaluation with a dedicated chest CT can be
obtained.

Abdominal u/s [**4-22**]:
LIMITED ABDOMINAL ULTRASOUND: The liver appears small and
echogenic, consistent with known cirrhosis. There is massive
ascites. There is extensive subcutaneous soft tissue edema,
which severely limits visualization of the kidneys. There is no
gross hydronephrosis. The bladder is collapsed around a Foley
catheter.
LIVER DOPPLER: There is no flow in the left portal vein. There
is either no flow or minimal, less than 5 cm per second, flow in
the main and right portal veins. The main hepatic artery is
patent with normal direction of flow and normal waveform. The
right, mid, and left hepatic veins are patent with normal
direction of flow and normal waveforms.
IMPRESSION:
1) Cirrhosis and massive ascites.
2) Minimal, if any, flow in the main and right portal veins. No
flow in the left portal vein.
3) Very limited evaluation of the kidneys. No gross
hydronephrosis.

HEAD CT [**5-2**]: There is a small subdural high-attenuation
collection in the frontotemporal region, unchanged from one day
prior. A small right frontal subdural hematoma is present. There
is mild narrowing of the sulci in the right frontal lobe. No
shift of normally midline structures is present. No other areas
of high attenuation are present. The ventricles are not
enlarged. The basal cisterns are unremarkable. The [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white
matter differentiation is preserved.
The osseous structures are unremarkable. The mastoid air cells
are normally aerated. There is layering fluid within the
maxillary, sphenoid, ethmoid, and frontal sinuses. This fluid
has increased in the interval.
IMPRESSION:
1) Stable tiny left frontotemporal subdural hematoma, without
mass effect.
2) Small right fronta
