History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 19463**] is an 88 year old gentleman with a past medical
history significant for metastatic SCC with unknown primary,
CAD, AS, AF on coumadin, and a recent inguinal surgery
complicated by Pseudomonal and Enterococcal seroma on pip/tazo
and NSTEMI with newly depressed LVEF to 35% now admitted for
hypoxemic respiratory distress.  The patient was diagnosted with
a pneumonia on [**4-22**] by CXR after developing fever and dyspnea
while at rehab treated with vancomycin, azithro, and continued
on pip/tazo. This morning, he was noted to be febrile  at [**Doctor Last Name **]
house to 101.3 and hypoxemic with SaO2 88-92% NRB. Over the last
several days his SBPs were running 80s to 90s. He received 40 mg
lasix, and was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation.
.
Of note, the patient was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] [**Date range (1) 19464**] under
Surgery, after initially underoing right inguinal-femoral
lymphadenectomy complicated by seroma formation. At that time,
he was transferred to the ICU for hypotension, and was also
noted to have an atrial tachycardia and troponinemia felt to be
an NSTEMI with peak CK 567, MB 49, TnT 2.23.  He has undergone
IR drainage and drain placement, with serial cultures
demonstrating Pseudomonas and Enterococcus, with plan for
prolonged pip/tazo therapy with ID follow-up.
.
In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, initial VS 98.1, 88, 101/57, 24 89%NRB. Labs
were notable for WBC 16, INR 3.8, and creatinine 1.7.  A CXR
demonstrated bilateral airspace opacities, he received cefepime,
and was briefly placed on NIPPV. He was then admitted to the
MICU for further management.
.
Currently, the patient continues to complain of dyspnea. He
denies any CP, palpitations, orthopnea, PND.

Brief Hospital Course:
addmitted [**4-25**] with hypoxia and 3/29/11tolerating NRB mask with
troponin bump from 0.39 > 0.47 > 0.63 > 0.69, but flat CK
(cycling CE after likely tachycardia-induced anterior EKG
repolarization abnormalities). Outpatient cardiologist
recomended continuation of previous cardiac regimen. [**4-27**]
broadened to vanco/meropenem due to worsening pneumonia on CXR
per ID recs. Persistenly hypoxic, on BiPAP intermittently and
NRB, gas showing P02 60. Lasix for presumed element of CHF> goal
negative 1 liter. [**2146-4-28**] worsening CXR with possible ARDS pt
DNR/DNI after family meeting. 6L negative through hospital
course to this point. [**2146-4-29**] pt made CMO after conversation with
patient, his wife, and PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**First Name (STitle) **]. Abx stopped, written for
morphine, increased dose overnight given increasing
discomfort/work of breathing. Pt expired [**4-30**] in morning after
cardiac arrest while recieving morphine for comfort.
