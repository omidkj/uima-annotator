.
CXR [**2115-2-1**]: 1. Interval improvement in CHF compared to [**2115-1-17**],
with very slight vascular congestion. 2. Persistent left
retrocardiac opacity, probably due to atelectasis; pneumonia
cannot be definitively excluded.
3. Underlying emphysema.
.
Bilateral upper extremity ultrasound [**2115-2-4**]: Deep vein
thrombosis identified within the right internal jugular vein and
within one of the two right brachial veins. No deep vein
thrombosis identified in the left arm.
.
Bilateral lower extremity  ultrasound [**2115-2-4**]:  No evidence for
DVT bilateral lower extremities. Right common femoral line.
.
[**2115-2-4**] CXR:  In comparison with the study of [**2-4**], the patient
has taken a better inspiration but there is otherwise little
change. Again, the cardiac silhouette is mildly prominent and
there is fullness of indistinct pulmonary vessels consistent
with elevated pulmonary venous pressure. The area behind the
heart is impossible to [**Date Range 4656**] though some atelectatic change
and/or pleural effusion can certainly not be excluded. Various
tubes and wires remain in place.
.
[**2115-2-6**] CXR: The NG tube tip passes below the diaphragm with its
tip terminating below the inferior margin of the field of view
most likely in the stomach. There is no change in the multiple
pacemaker leads with the external pacemakers terminating at the
left ventricle epicardium. Mild cardiomegaly is unchanged.
Bilateral perihilar haziness representing pulmonary edema is
grossly unchanged. Bilateral pleural effusions are small to
moderate, layering.
.
[**2115-2-6**] CXR: Little overall change.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 76 year old man with CAD, CHF EF 15%,
Cardiomyopathy with recent ICU admission for PNA/hypotension
presented from rehab with 4-5 days of cough and decreased
energy. + productive cough. He denied fevers, chills. Admitted
intially to medicine service with a question of PNA, volume
status unclear.  [**Name2 (NI) **] received gentle IVF due to depressed EF,
increasing O2 req. While on the floor, his volume status and low
urine output were concerns. He appears dry, but care was taken
with IV fluids given known cardiomyopathy. During the day
[**2114-2-4**] he had an increasing oxygen requirement with increased
work of breathing. He was found with SaO2= 70s-80s in marked
respiratory distress and placed on a NRB. A Code was then called
for rapid anesthesia response and urgent intubation. He was
transfered to the ICU.

.
FIRST MICU COURSE: He was intubated [**2-5**], a mucous plug was
suctioned and his breathing improved markedly afterwards.  He
was extubated [**2-6**] and his O2sats were stable on 2L NC.
Vancomycin and aztreonam had been started in ICU, but he
continued on only Vanco x4 days for MRSA in sputum. He had low
UOP which responded to gentle IVF 250cc boluses.  He also had
hypotension that was IVF responsive not on pressors. Upper
extremity swelling was noted and due to RIJ/SCV clots in setting
of therapeutic INR with a question of coumadin failure so he was
placed on a heparin gtt.   For acces he initially had a femoral
line which was eventually taken out as he had a  midline placed
by IR [**2-8**].  His underlying AF w/[**Month/Day (4) **] was stable with a heart
rate in the 70s-80s.  It was determined that he needed PEG due
to aspiration noted on S&S done in MICU [**2-8**]. Pt's hypotension
resolved, and his oxygen saturation remained 100% 2LNC so he was
transferred to the medical floor.

At 5pm he triggered for hypoxia (80s on 5 liters NC).  SaO2
continued to drop to 72% on NRB.  He was sunctioned with return
of thick, tan, bloody secretions; his O2 sat improved to 100%.
At 9:45pm, he again experience O2 desaturation to the low 70s on
a shovel mask with an ABG showing 7.45/42/426; the SaO2
increased to 100% on a NRB.  Lasix (10mg IV) was given.  A few
hours later his HR increased to the 130s; this was 30 minutes
after the lasix had been administered with ~40cc of urine.  He
was treated with 250cc of NS and then transferred to the ICU for
further care for hypoxia and mental status changes.

SECOND MICU COURSE:
He was diagnosed with a MRSA pneumonia by culture, though there
is no clear infiltrate on CXR (possibly in left retrocardiac
region).  Of note, this patient was admitted in early [**Month (only) 404**]
with a RLL opacity and completed a 7 day course of cefpodoxime
and 5 days of azithromycin.  He has clear cough and had mucous
plugging necessitating intubation. He completed a course of
vancomycin and flagyl. He was kept NPO, and put on aspiration
precautions, HOB>30.  In addition he received aggressive chest
PT.  His WBC was elevated on admission to the hospital but
normalized.  He remained afebrile.
He continued to produce secretions that required frequent
suctioning but remained on a nasal cannula between 2-5L.  He is
unable to clear these secretions effectively and it was
discussed with his wife that a tracheostomy tube may be
indicated.  On discharge he was satting in the high nineties on
room air.
.
He had a PEG tube placed to aid with dysphagia and aspiration.
He received tube feeds and tolerated them well, was able to
advance feeds to goal as defined by nutrition.
.
He has chronic systolic ischemic heart failure
