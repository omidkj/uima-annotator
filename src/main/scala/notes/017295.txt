Service:  ENT


HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient had a history of
recurrent laryngeal cancer after completing an initial course
of radiation therapy seven years ago.  He began to develop
worsening voice and slowly progressive shortness of breath,
noisy breathing and was initially treated for a chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation flare with oxygen
nebulizers, intravenous steroids and antibiotics.  He was
then worked up by an outside otolaryngologist who found what
is believed to be a T4N0M0 squamous cell carcinoma of the
glottis.  He was seen by cardiology who determined him to be
high risk surgical candidate secondary to congestive heart
failure, coronary artery disease, but surgery was necessary
and he was transferred to [**Hospital1 188**] for an ENT evaluation for tracheotomy versus
laryngectomy.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs were 97.6, pulse 91, blood
pressure 88/47, respiratory rate 23, and satting 98 percent
on 2 liters nasal cannula. His examination revealed
inspiratory [**Last Name (un) 15883**], speaking without distress.  His left
nare showed polypoid changes of the posterior aspect of the
left inferior turbinate.  The neck showed fullness
anteriorly, but no obviously palpable lymph nodes.  Tongue
was mobile without palpable masses.  On the fiberoptic
examination it revealed a large irregular mass on the right
arytenoid with fixation of the right true vocal cord.  The
mass extended across the midline.  There was poor excursion
of the left true vocal cord with a 2 mm airway.  Lungs had
faint expiratory wheezes.  Examination was otherwise
unremarkable.

LABORATORIES ON ADMISSION:  Chem 7 was sodium 137, potassium
4.1, glucose 253, BUN 23, creatinine 0.7.  Otherwise
laboratories were remarkable for a white blood cell count of
8.5 with 82 percent neutrophils, hematocrit 33.3, INR 1.0.
electrocardiogram on [**7-23**] showed normal sinus rhythm at
90, a left axis deviation with a QRS of .10.  Anterior Q
waves in V1 through V4 with ST elevation.  CT scan of the
chest with contrast on [**2170-7-27**] showed no evidence of
metastatic disease in the thorax.  It did show thickening of
the mucosa with enhancement in the laryngeal region
consistent with his known laryngeal cancer.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  After receiving cardiac clearance on [**2170-7-26**] the patient underwent tracheostomy, esophagoscopy,
biopsy and followed by a total laryngectomy.  Two JP drains
were placed.  Postoperatively the patient remained stable.
He was started on Lopressor for perioperative beta blockade,
trach care and nebulizer treatments as well as GI prophylaxis
and was started on antibiotics prophylaxis with Ancef and
Flagyl.  He was kept NPO.  Overnight he was kept in the
Intensive Care Unit after which time he remained stable and
was transferred to the floor.  On postoperative day four he
was started on tube feeds to well tolerated and ultimately
advanced to goal rate of 75 cc per hour.  The PICC line was
placed for intravenous access.  The patient was seen by
Speech and Swallow Service and started teaching him regarding
the use of the electrolarynx.  On postoperative day six the
patient developed erythema and induration at the stoma site
with no fluctuance and at that time one JP drain was
discontinued.  On postoperative day seven part of the
patient's staples were removed and his intrastromal erythema
remained unchanged.  On postoperative day eight the patient
had an episode of hypotension to 80/42.  He remained
asymptomatic and recheck of the blood pressure was 90/60 with
an unchanged electrocardiogram.  Later that same evening the
patient had an episode of nonsustained ventricular
tachycardia times ten beats at 125 beats per minute, but was
asymptomatic with stable blood pressure.  He remained on
telemetry and electrolytes were normal.

On day eleven the patient had a swallow study, which showed
no aspiration.  The tube feeds were discontinued and the diet
was advanced to clears. He tolerated his po diet well.  He
remained with stable vital signs, ambulating, good O2 sats on
room air.  He was evaluated by physical therapy and
occupational therapy who cleared him to go home with services
to assist him in deep suctioning and stoma care.  On the day
prior to discharge [**2170-8-7**] the second JP was
discontinued.  The patient continued to do well and was set
up  for home care services.  The patient was noted to have
one low potassium level prior to discharge of 3.3 for which
he was repleated in the hospital and sent home with potassium
chloride tablets.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Stable.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  To home with VNA Services.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:  Recurrent laryngeal cancer.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1. Bacitracin to the wound b.i.d.
2. Metoprolol 12.5 mg po b.i.d., although the patient's blood
   pressure was low in the hospital, will verify that the
   patient has a home blood pressure kit so that he may
   monitored his home blood pressures and not take his
   medications if it is less then 90/60.
3. Atrovent nebulizers to be inhaled q 6 hours.
4. Famotidine 20 mg b.i.d.
5. Aspirin 325 q.d.
6. Atorvastatin 20 mg q.d.
7. Bumetanide 2 mg q.d.
8. Acetaminophen 325 mg q 4 to 6 hours prn.
9. Docusate sodium 150 per 15 ml po b.i.d.
10.      Potassium chloride 20 milliequivalent tabs one q.d.
11.      The patient was also ordered for a suction machine,
   compressor kit, tracheotomy kit, Yankauer suction
   catheters.
12.      Reglan 5 mg tablet one po q.d.

The patient will follow up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] in one week.  The
sutures will remain in until that time. The patient will also
follow up with his primary care physician regarding his
cardiac health and diabetes management.
