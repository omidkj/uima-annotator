Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4327**]
Chief Complaint:
V fib arrest

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
IABP placement
Cardiac Catheterization
Central venous catheter
arterial cannulation

History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 42 yo M with a reported hx of alcoholism who
was reportedly feeling poorly yesterday afternoon.  He went to
his friend's house where he had a witnessed arrest with
associated seizure like activity.  CPR was started on the scene
by nurse bystander.  AED was on scene and gave pt two shocks.
Pt subsequently went into sinus tach with ROSC.  Pt was also
given narcan and became combative.
.
Was brought to OSH and started on amio, heparin [**Last Name (LF) 1868**], [**First Name3 (LF) **],
intubated and received 2L cool saline but not started on artic
sun.  EKG showed inferior STE.  Labs were notable for
hyperkalemia of 6.5, troponin of 0.06.  On way to [**Hospital1 18**] pt went
into vtach requiring another shock.
.
In ED EKG showed STE in inferior leads, U/S showed paradoxical
septal wall motion and overall hypokinesis, worsened by
dopamine.  Amio drip started.  Dopamine gtt was started while
waiting for cath lab due to pressures 50s/30s.
.
In the cath lab, found to have circ lesion, stent placed,
concern for wide open MR.  Oddly, MVO2 was 85%, and shunt run
was negative.  IABP was placed.


Past Medical History:
restless leg syndrome
alcoholism

Per mother, patient only has hx of alcoholism (30 pack of beer
every day) and was feeling tired today. Otherwise in USOH prior
to incident. As far as mother knows, does not abuse drugs.

IMAGING
[**2122-9-27**] Cardiac cath
1. Selective coronary angiography of this left dominant system
demonstrated two vessel coronary artery disease. The LMCA was
patent.
The LAD had minor diffuse disease. The LCX had a tubular
proximal lesion
of abotu 80% with possible thrombosis. The RCA had a chronic
occlusion
mid-vessel with collaterals filling from the left coronary
system.
2. Limited resting hemodyanmics revealed elevated right and
left-sided
filling pressures with PASP of 54mmHG and mean PCWP of 35mmHg.
3. Left ventriculography revealed global hypokinesis with an
estimated
LV ejection fraction of less than 30%. There was also [**3-6**]+
Mitral
regurgitation. Cardiac index was preserved at 4.5 L/min/m2 using
a
pulmonary arterial saturation of 85% in the Fick equation. No
shunts
were observed.
4. An intra-aortic balloon pump was placed sheathed in the right
femoral
artery.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Two vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Severe mitral regurgitation.
3. Severe systolic ventricular dysfunction.
4. Acute inferior myocardial infarction, managed by acute ptca.
 PTCA of  vessel.
5. Intra-aortic balloon pump placement.
.
[**2122-9-29**] ECHO: The left atrium is elongated. There is moderate
regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
inferior/inferolateral akinesis and anteroseptal
hypokinesis/akinesis (LVEF approximately 35 percent). Right
ventricular chamber size is normal. with normal free wall
contractility. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
structurally normal. Physiologic mitral regurgitation is seen
(within normal limits). There is borderline pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared to [**2122-9-27**], left ventricular function appears less
depressed but views are suboptimal for comparison.
.
[**2122-9-30**] CXR: Mild interstitial pulmonary edema predominantly in
the right upper lung is new. The large right lower lobe
consolidation most likely aspiration pneumonia is stable, now
accompanied by at least a small if not larger right pleural
effusion. Intra-aortic balloon pump has been removed. Ascending
Swan-Ganz rotation catheter ends in the right descending
pulmonary artery. ET tube in standard placement. Nasogastric
tube loops in the upper stomach. No left pleural effusion. No
pneumothorax.
.
[**2122-10-1**] CT C-SPINE W/O CONTRAST: There is no evidence of acute
fracture or mala
