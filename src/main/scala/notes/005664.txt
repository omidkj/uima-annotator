History of Present Illness:
History of Present Illness:73 year old male with CAD s/p CABG X
5
[**2110**] who was recently at [**Hospital6 3105**] after
experiencing "pressure" in his chest a few weeks ago. Per the
patient, he appeared to be in heart failure and was diuresed. At
this hospitalization, he was also found to be in A-fib. He was
discharged on [**8-5**] and the next morning felt pressure in his
chest again and went to [**Hospital1 18**]. A recent cardiac catheterization
reveals that his previous bypass grafts are stenotic. A recent
TEE shows 3+ MR.

PA&lat [**8-25**]
TECHNIQUE:  AP upright chest radiograph.

FINDINGS:  Interval removal of the endotracheal tube. Right
central venous
catheter is unchanged. Moderate pleural effusion on the left
with surrounding
atelectasis appears worse compared to the prior study.
Atelectatic changes
seen within the right base are stable.  Lungs are otherwise
clear with no
evidence of focal consolidation. No pneumothorax.

IMPRESSION:
Moderate left pleural effusion and surrounding atelectasis
appears slightly
worse compared to the prior study.

[**2128-8-24**]:
ARTERIAL STUDY

HISTORY:  Cutdown for removal of an intra-aortic balloon pump on
the left.

FINDINGS:  Duplex and color Doppler of the left inguinal area
was performed.
Waveforms at the left common femoral artery are monophasic which
indicate an
element of inflow disease, most likely at the iliac level.
Grayscale and
color Doppler also indicate areas of sequential stenosis
involving the
superficial femoral artery, velocities do not appear to be
elevated, but
likely due to poor inflow.  All waveforms do remain monophasic
diffusely.
There is no evidence of a pseudoaneurysm or hematoma or AV
fistula.

IMPRESSION:
1.  No sequela of recent cutdown for removal of a left femoral
access used for
an intra-aortic balloon pump.

2.  Findings consistent with both inflow and outflow disease at
the femoral
level, i.e., superficial femoral arterial stenosis, probable
common femoral or
external iliac disease on the left.

[**2128-8-23**]
TECHNIQUE:  Bilateral lower extremity grayscale and color and
pulsed-wave
Doppler.

COMPARISON:  None.

FINDINGS: A clot is identified in the left greater saphenous
vein. A clot is
also identified in the right peroneal veins. There is a hematoma
around the
right proximal superficial femoral vein without evidence of
color flow to
suggest pseudoaneurysm or AV fistula. There is normal phasicity
of the common
femoral veins bilaterally. There is normal compression and
waveforms in the
common femoral, superficial femoral, popliteal, and posterior
tibial veins
bilaterally. There is normal compression of the peroneal vein on
the left. The
right peroneal vein is not compressible and no color flow could
be
demonstrated.

IMPRESSION:
1. Deep venous thrombosis in the right peroneal veins.
2. Superficical thrombophlebitis of the left greater saphenous
vein.
3. Hematoma around the proximal superficial vein without
evidence of color
flow to suggest pseudoaneurysm or AV fistula.

TTE [**8-16**]:
Conclusions
Chest Closure ECHO:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. No mass/thrombus is seen in
the left atrium or left atrial appendage. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is moderately depressed
(LVEF=35-40 %). The remaining left ventricular segments contract
normally and are unchanged from prior. Right ventricular chamber
size and free wall motion are normal. There are simple atheroma
in the ascending aorta. There are simple atheroma in the
descending thoracic aorta. No evidence of dissection. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation. A
mechanical mitral valve prosthesis is present and well seated
without perivalvular leak. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in
person of the results in the operating room

[**2128-8-17**] EKG:
Atrial fibrillation with ventricular premature beats. Right
bundle-branch
block. Left anterior fascicular block. Compared to the previous
tracing
of [**2128-8-16**] the Q-T interval looks slightly shorter on the
current tracing.
The other findings are similar.









Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the hospital preoperatively recently
diagnosed with atrial fibrillation who presented with chest pain
at rest.Past history of CABG. Admitted to hospital with CHF and
was diursed. He was taken emergently to the OR and emergently
placed on bypass please see intraoperative note for details. He
arrived from OR with open chest,paralyzed, sedated on multiple
pressors and inotropes, initally low index and mixed venous,
IABP 1:1. Of note this had been placed surgically in the OR.
IABP removed at bedside within 24hrs, purse string stitch in
place. Left leg cooler with  weak pulse in the setting of
pressors and thromcytopenia. He was seen by the vascular service
but no intervention was warranted and left leg continued to
improve. Pressors and inotropes were weaned off slowly he
remained in atrial fibrillation. His chest was sucessfully
closed on POD#3. He awoke slowly over the course of three to
four days. He was aggressively diureses. He eventually extubated
and was very deconditioned, required aggressive pulmonary
toileting. He became alkalotic and lasix was adjusted. His renal
function remained stable. Chest tubes and pacing wires removed
without difficulty. Prior to transferring to floor he developed
left lower extremity erythemia and left calf pain. The concern
arose for DVT or compartment syndrome. He was again seen by the
vascular service. His studies were negative for significant DVT
please see reports for further details, negative for comparment
syndrome. The celulitis resp
