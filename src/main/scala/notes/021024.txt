Hypotension

History of Present Illness:
Mrs. [**Known lastname **] is an 87-year-old woman with a history of MDS with
AML, HTN, DM and COPD, initially admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] from [**Date range (1) 17433**]
with sepsis and hypotension, called out to floor, and now
re-admitted for recurrent hypotension.
.
She was initially admitted on [**2140-9-11**] after being transferred
from a rehab facility with fever and AMS in the setting of
receiving Decitabine cycle #2, Day #7. She was transferred to
the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] shortly after presentation and her course was notable
for septic shock requiring pressors and removal of her PICC
line; culture data demonstrated likely corynbacterium. She was
stabilized and transferred back to BMT on [**9-14**]. She remained
hemodynamically stable though continuing to spike fevers until
102F until [**2140-9-19**], when she had an episode of hyotension to the
60s in the setting of rapid cooling while febrile. Her SBP
increased to the 80s after a 500cc bolus of NS.
.
She again became hypotensive to the 70s overnight in the setting
of fever, but SBP did not improve with 250cc x 2 + 500cc x 1
bolus. She was then transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for further
management.
.
Her course on the floor was notable for worsening mental status,
c. diff + stool, and a gradually increasing O2 requirement, from
room air/3L intermittently on [**9-16**] to 5L nasal cannula on the
day of transfer.
.
On arrival to the floor, she was laying in bed, intermittently
responsive, and poorly managing her oral secretions. An ABG/VBG
was performed that demonstrated 7.26/55/53.
.

Past Medical History:
- MDS with AML conversion in [**2139**], responded will to Decitabine,

Brief Hospital Course:
87F with history of MDS with AML transformation in [**2139**],
currently on Decitarbine cycle 2 admitted with fever in 102's
and altered mental status.  Patient was admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**]
with septic shock causing altered mental status, hypotension in
the setting of a blast crisis from her AML.  She was neutropenic
and her course was complictated by acute kidney injury, anemia
requiring blood transfusions, hypovolemic hyponatremia, and
diabetes   She was initially treated with broad spectrum
antibiotics, including intravenous Vancomycin, Cefepime, Flagyl
and Oral vancomycin.  Patient was resuscitated IVF, and received
pRBCs while in the ICU. She was eventually found to have C.
difficile and so cefepime and intravenous vancomycin were
discontinued.  She was initially on high doses of vasopressin
and levophed, which were subsequently weaned and discontinued.
She was eventually stabilized and transferred to the oncology
team.  However she began spiking fevers again.  The source of
the fevers was uncertain.  Broad spectum antibiotics were
restarted.  However, she became hypotensive and began to develop
respiratory distress and hypoxia.  Her wishes were to be
DNR/DNI.  Her goals of care were discussed with her sons and
they felt that she would wish to pursue comfort care at this
point given the state of her underlying AML and the severity of
her sepsis.  She was placed on a morphine drip and she passed
away peacefully on [**2140-9-21**].
