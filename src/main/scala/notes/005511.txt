ADDENDUM:  The patient was scheduled for discharge on [**2124-11-24**]; however, he spiked a temperature.  He grew out
coagulase-negative Staphylococcus from presumed line sepsis
from his peripherally inserted central catheter line.  The
peripherally inserted central catheter line was discontinued.
The patient was started on vancomycin.  He became hypotensive
due to sepsis and was started on Levophed.

Around this time it was noted that his alkaline phosphatase
and bilirubins began to rise.  On [**11-24**], and ultrasound
was done which showed distended common bile duct with sludge.
He was started on Levaquin and Flagyl to cover possible
cholangitis or other intra-abdominal infections.

A CT of the abdomen was done on [**11-24**].  It showed slight
thickening of the cecum, not associated with fat stranding.
The above finding could be secondary to not fully distended
cecum versus chronic colitis.  There was no evidence of
perforation or abscess.

On [**11-28**], the patient had a HIDA scan performed which
showed no visualization of the gallbladder, consistent with
acute cholecystitis.

A right upper quadrant ultrasound done on [**11-29**] showed
gallbladder mildly distended with sludge, thickened wall,
pericholecystic fluid.  No stones seen in the common bile
duct.  A percutaneous cholecystostomy tube was placed on
[**11-29**] with drainage of bile.  The fluid was sent for
staining.  No organisms were found.  A cholangiogram was
performed and showed normal cystic duct, intrahepatic and
extrahepatic biliary tree with flow of contrast to the
duodenum.  No ductal stones or strictures were visualized.
The bile fluid was sent for culture and did not show any
growth.

After the procedure, his alkaline phosphatase and total
bilirubin began to trend down.  They continued to trend down
over several days; however, his alkaline phosphatase (which
had been 1500) plateaued around 1000.

A repeat right upper quadrant ultrasound was done on [**12-4**] which showed no biliary ductal dilatation, no fluid
collection, and cholecystostomy tube in the appropriate
place.

The patient also was noted to have a rash around this time.
Dermatology was consulted.  It was noted that the patient's
rash corresponded to an increase in eosinophilia.
Dermatology felt that the rash was secondary to drug
interaction.  The patient was noted to have had
cephalosporins during the course of the admission.  These
were discontinued.  The rash and the eosinophilia improved
after the patient was taken off cephalosporins; mainly
ceftazidime and cefepime.

The patient remained hypotensive secondary to presumed
sepsis.  Around this time, the patient was noted to have a
rise in his creatinine.  Renal Service was consulted who felt
the acute renal failure was secondary to hypoperfusion rather
than acute tubular necrosis or acute interstitial nephritis.
It was recommended that the patient's blood pressure be kept
above 110.  Once this was accomplished with increasing
pressors, the patient's creatinine began to trend down, and
by the time of discharge, the patient's creatinine had been
at baseline for at least one week.

The patient continued to spike despite his antibiotic
therapy.  A CT of the torso was done on [**12-2**] to look
for possible intra-abdominal abscess.  It showed interval
development of multiple wedge-shaped and irregular low
attenuation fossae within the spleen; suggestive of septic
emboli.

A transesophageal echocardiogram was performed on [**11-24**]
that showed no evidence of endocarditis.  No signs of atrial
septal defect or patent foramen ovale.

The patient had a CT done of his head to look for signs of
septic emboli to the brain.  The head CT showed a small
subacute cerebellar cortical infarct; concerning for possible
emboli.  A magnetic resonance imaging was done on [**12-7**]
and showed no significant findings.  Did not see the infarct
found on the head CT.  There were no signs of abnormal
intracranial enhancement to suggest an infectious process,
and there was no evidence of infarction.

The patient was noted to have sinus and mastoid congestion
which were noted to be present earlier in the course of his
admission.

The patient became defervescent around the end of [**Month (only) 359**].
However, at this time it was also noted that his white blood
cell count started trending down from 6 down to 3.5 down to
2.4.  With concern for anemia and possible neutropenia,
Hematology was consulted.  It was noted that his platelets
remained stable.  Hematology felt that the most likely
etiology was a drug reaction; however, infectious etiologies
were also high on the list.  Vasculitis and infiltrations
were less likely; however, these were worked up.  The patient
initially had Haldol, ursodiol, and hydralazine discontinued
without effect.

In terms of infectious workup, cytomegalovirus, [**Doctor Last Name 3271**]-[**Doctor Last Name **]
virus, and parvovirus were all sent and turned out negative.
Additionally, Legionella, ehrlichiosis, and Bartonella were
also sent off.  Infiltrative processes were evaluated
initially by SPEP which was negative; later by bone marrow
biopsy which showed no evidence of malignant process and
decreased myeloid and erythroid cells; consistent with bone
marrow suppression secondary to drug reaction or infectious
process.  Vasculitis was less likely after ANCA came back
negative.  The patient was started on G-CSF.  His vancomycin
was discontinued after a 16-day course.  At that time, he was
also started on doxycycline to cover possible ehrlichiosis
mycoplasma, and [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 9880**] spotted fever.

The patient started spiking fevers again as aztreonam was
started in the setting of continued Pseudomonas growth in his
sputum; concern that his colonization was Pseudomonas might
present a problem in the status of his neutropenia.
Levofloxacin was also continued.  The patient was started on
G-CSF around this time.  His absolute neutrophil count fell
to as low as 70 before starting to recover.  It was felt at
this time that the most likely cause of his neutropenia was
the vancomycin.  Flagyl was also discontinued around this
time; however, it was less likely, and his titers for
mycoplasma ehrlichiosis and [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 9880**] spotted fever all
came up negative; so it was felt that infectious was not a
likely cause of his neutropenia.  Doxycycline was
discontinued after seven days.  The dual coverage for the
Pseudomonas were continued for seven days, and then aztreonam
and levofloxacin were discontinued.

The patient had a repeat CT scan to evaluate for progression
of his splenic infarct to see if there were any interval
changes.  The abdominal CT performed on [**2124-12-13**]
showed no change in splenic emboli, and no new infarcts.  It
also noted interval decrease in his ascites.  At this point,
it is believed that the patient does not have any ongoing
endovascular process.

The patient continued to be ventilator dependent with
withdrawal of the tracheostomy which was placed on [**2124-11-10**].  This was secondary to deconditioning, secretions, and
anxiety, and volume overload.  As his blood urea nitrogen and
creatinine had fallen with the resolution of his acute renal
failure, it was felt that the patient could be started on
diuretics to remove fluid.  The patient was up 30 liters.
The patient was diuresed over 10 liters in the ensuring week
and a half with his weight actually falling to below where it
was on admission.  At this point, the patient had no signs of
edema.  It was felt that it was reasonable to start weaning
him from the ventilator.  The patient was given a short trial
on a tracheostomy mask and was found to tolerate it.  He
continued to be given trials on tracheostomy mask; going
several hours during the day and then being rested on the
ventilator overnight.  Eventually, the patient tolerated a
tracheostomy mask 24 hours without requiring ventilatory
support.  The patient still required frequent suctioning;
