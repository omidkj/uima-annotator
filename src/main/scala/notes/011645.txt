delirium and hypotension with SBP's in 60's. She was recently
discharged on [**2200-8-25**] after admission for delirium and acute
renal failure [**1-6**] dehydration. Prior to that, she had been
discharged on [**2200-8-22**] with failure to thrive, ARF, and CAP
treated with a seven day course of levaquin (finished on
[**2200-8-26**]). Today, she presents with worsening delirium. She had
been at [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 1188**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] for the last 2 days and confusion was
worsening. She was found wandering the halls, pulling at IVs and
not answering questions appropriately, talking about the past.
She was reported to be holding her abdomen, but no complaints

cooking and cleaning. She has been eating and drinking very

setting of cont. delirium. She had a lactate of 4.0 and was
given 3L of IVFs with complete normalization of her blood
pressure. A bedside U/S was done and unremarkable. CXR showed a
potentially worsening RUL infiltrate. She received

Imaging:
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)	Study Date of [**2200-8-27**] 2:54 PM
IMPRESSION: Chronic appearing interstitial lung disease with
worsening in the right lung opacuity likely reflecting worsening
of pneumonia. Followup to resolution. CT chest after resolution
of acute symptoms can be done to assess the interstitial lung
disease.

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST	Study Date of [**2200-8-29**] 10:48 AM
FINDINGS: There is no evidence of acute hemorrhage or shift of
normally midline structures. The ventricles and sulci are
prominent, consistent with age-related atrophy. There is a right
lacunar infarct identified. There are extensive vascular
calcifications of the cavernous portion of the internal carotid
arteries. There is extensive periventricular white matter
hypodensity, consistent with chronic small vessel ischemic
changes.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of acute hemorrhage. Please note that
MRI is more
sensitive in detection of acute ischemia.

CT CHEST W/O CONTRAST	Study Date of [**2200-8-29**] 10:48 AM
IMPRESSION:
1. Pneumonic consolidation predominantly involving the right
upper lobe and
lesser involvement of right middle lobe lateral segment. No
evidence of centrally obstructing mass.
2. Moderate bilateral effusions, right greater than left, with
adjacent areas of atelectasis.

Brief Hospital Course:
[**Age over 90 **] yo woman presented with Legionella pneumonia, altered mental
status, acute on chronic renal failure.
.
# Pneumonia: RUL infiltrate seen on admission CXR.  Patient has
completed a 7 day course of levofloxacin prior to this
admission. She was found to have positive Legionella urinary
antigen and was treated with azithromycin, which was to be
continued for 5 days after discharge. CT chest showed pneumonia
consolidation of the right upper and middle lobes as well as
moderate bilateral effusions.  Patient continued to
symptomatically improve on the azithromycin, now saturating well
on room air. Patient was advised to follow up with PCP after
discharge.
.
# Delirium: Most likely due to pneumonia. CT head was
unremarkable. Her delirium resolved with treatment of pneumonia.


# Acute on chronic renal failure:  Likely a result of poor po
intake and dehydration.  Creatinine returned to baseline after
IV fluids.
.
# Hypertension:  Blood pressure was stable on this admission.
Amlodipine was held due to concerns for worsening constipation
with CCB contributing to delirium.  HCTZ was discontinued on
previous admission due to hyponatremia, now resolved.  Not
restarted durin gthis admission, although lower extremity edema
was monitored and stable. HCTZ re-initiation should be
considered as outpatient.
