HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Baby girl [**Known lastname 14782**] was born at 32
weeks gestational age to a 33-year-old G3, P0-1 mother.  The
pregnancy was complicated by growth restriction at 25 weeks,
less than tenth percentile growth.  The growth restriction
proceeded to a point where the estimated fetal weight was
less than the third percentile.  Subsequently, the mother was
admitted for observation and was treated with betamethasone
at that time on [**2146-8-10**].  On the day of delivery,
decelerations were noted and the mother was taken for a
cesarean section.  Also of note, prenatal ultrasounds were
notable for a two vessel cord and bilateral club feet.
Maternal history is also significant for previous ectopic
pregnancy as well as a ruptured appendix.  The mother's
prenatal screens were as follows:  Blood type O positive,
antibody negative, hepatitis B negative, RPR nonreactive,
rubella immune, GBS negative.  The infant was delivered via a
cesarean section with no spontaneous respirations, heart rate
greater than 100.  The patient received positive pressure
ventilation times several seconds with immediate response in
spontaneous respirations.  Due to increased work of breathing
and irregular respirations at five minutes, the patient was
intubated and brought to the NICU for further management.
Apgar scores were three and seven at one and five minutes.
The patient exhibited excellent perfusion.
