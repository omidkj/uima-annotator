Chief Complaint:
Respiratory Distress

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Tracheostomy change with bronchoscopy and biopsy
.
PICC placement


History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 74yo F with history of COPD and recent
respiratory distress due to COPD exacerbation and pneumonia
requiring chest tube, VATS and eventual trach at [**Location (un) 620**] earlier
this month who presented to the ER from LTAC with respiratory
distress and vent dyssynchrony.
.
Patient was recently hospitalized at [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] from [**Date range (1) 80824**]
with complicated hospital course.  She presented with
respiratory distress and given concern for pneumothorax, she
underwent needle decompression.  Patient eventually underwent
VATS and trach with pleural fluid cultures from the VATS
revealing VRE, Proteus, coag-negative staph and [**Female First Name (un) 564**].
Initial sputum cultures revealed Pseudomonas.  Her hospital stay
was also complicated by sepsis requiring brief pressor support.
Her antibiotics were tailored to fluconazole, imipenem and
linezolid with plans for additional 10 day course (to end approx
[**5-25**]), and she was discharged to [**Hospital1 100**] LTAC on these through a
subclavian central line.
.
At the rehab, she was continued on these antibiotics.  Patient
developed vent discordance and was sent to [**Hospital1 18**] ER for further
evaluation.
.
In the ED, initial vs significant for hypotension with SBP<90.
She was started on levophed.  Patient was also given stress dose
steroids, home dose linezolid, 2L of NS and had CXR which showed
bilateral pleural effusions and bibasilar atelectasis.  CT of
her head was remarkable for encephalomalacia and CT torso showed
resolving pneumonia, stable AAA and large ventral hernia
containing bowel without signs of incarceration.  Surgery was
consulted but felt there was no acute surgical need.  Patient
was unable to have ABG drawn and VBG was significant for extreme
hypoxemia with gas 7.21/66/29/28.  She was admitted to the MICU
for further treatment.  Vitals on transfer were 77, 158/81 with
levo at 0.06, 94% AC 450x20, 5, 50% Fi02.
.
In the ICU, patient is intubated and not following commands or
responding to questions.
