History of Present Illness:
75 F with COPD, htn, bilateral hip replacements, depression,
anxiety transferred from OSH for NSTEMI. She was recently
hospitalized at [**Hospital3 **] from [**4-10**] to [**4-13**] for a R hip
dislocation s/p closed reduction. The hospital course was
complicated by respiratory failure requiring ICU stay for
bilateral PNA and COPD flare. She was discharged to home on a
course of doxycycline and steroid taper which she has not
finished yet. At home, she really has not been active and on the
night of [**4-20**], she felt so SOB she could not sleep. She had
trouble lying flat but did not notice weight gain or leg edema.
She also reports having increased clear sputum over the past
three days.

She was brought to [**Hospital3 417**] Hospital where initial CXR did
not show infiltrate or CHF. She was thought to have another COPD
flare and was given Ceftriaxone and steroids. She was thought to
be dry in fact and was given fluids initially. Eventually, her
cardiac markers came back positive: Troponins 8.8, 8.8 and 4.6,
CK 237, 190, 163; MB 56, 43, 40. She was given plavix and
lovenox and was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for cath.

During cath, she was found to have diffuse disease and she got 4
DES to the LAD. She was hypoxic and got 40 IV lasix and put out
1L. A RHC was not done. She was on a non-rebreather saturating
100% with SBP 110. She was then transferred to the CCU.

ROS: Denies chest pain, abd pain, n/v/d. Denies palpitations,
LH, syncope. Denies claudications. Denies bleeding disorder or
hematachezia or strokes.

Imaging:
[**2178-4-21**] Cardiac cath:
Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system
revealed
nonobstructive left main and 2 vessel obstructive coronary
artery
disease. The LMCA had a 40% stenosis distally, extending into
the ostium
of the LAD. The LAD was a large vessel that supplied the apex,
and was
diffusely diseased and calcified. There was a 40% ostial
stenosis,
followed by sequential 70% and 90% stenoses of the proximal and
mid LAD.
The LCX was totally occluded, and was collateralized distally by
the
RCA. The RCA had lumenal irregularities up to 30-40% stenosis of
the
proximal and mid vessel, but was otherwise patent. Patient
received 4 DES to the LAD.

[**2178-4-21**] CXR:
The heart size is mildly enlarged. The mediastinum is slightly
shifted
towards the right that might be due to atelectasis or scarring
in the right upper lobe. Lungs are overall hyperinflated with
start increase in
interstitial prominence in both lungs which might represent
interstitial
pulmonary edema in the presence of emphysema. Round dense
approximately 2 cm opacity projecting over the right hilus and
may represent calcified lymph node.

[**2178-4-22**] CXR:
The ET tube tip is 5 cm above the carina. The cardiomediastinal
silhouette is stable with slightly decreased heart size. It
might be due to initiation of mechanical ventilation. The lungs
remain over- inflated and essentially clear except for minimal
opacity at the right base which may represent atelectasis versus
small aspiration and linear right perihilar scarring. The
previously suspected nodular opacity is not seen on the current
study and may be obscured, thus evaluation with follow-up
radiograph is recommended. Interstitial edema has resolved.

[**2178-4-22**] ECG:
Probable atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response
rate at 165.
Non-specific generalized repolarization changes consistent with
tachycardia and/or ischemia. Cannot exclude left ventricular
hypertrophy. Compared to the previous tracing of [**2178-4-21**] normal
sinus rhythm with probable left atrial abnormality has given way
to atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate and the heart
rate has nearly doubled.

[**2178-4-23**] TTE:
Moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction (EF
40-45%) with severe hypokinesis of the basal to mid inferior and
inferolateral segments and mild hypokinesis of the basal to mid
anterior wall and anterior septum. Systolic function of apical
segments is relatively preserved. Tissue Doppler imaging
suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure
(PCWP>18mmHg). (1+) mitral regurgitation. Mild pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

[**2178-4-26**] ECG:  Sinus rhythm. Non-specific ST-T wave changes.
Compared to the previous tracing sinus rhythm has replaced
atrial fibrillation.

[**2178-4-26**] CXR: Severe hyperinflation reflects COPD. Elevation of
the minor fissure reflects volume loss in the right upper lobe.
Fullness in the right hilus may indicate adenopathy. Routine
radiographs are recommended as a first step and to see if
additional imaging with CT scanning is indicated.
Lungs clear of focal abnormality. Heart size normal. Thoracic
aorta is
generally large but not focally aneurysmal. No pneumothorax.


Brief Hospital Course:
1. NSTEMI: Patient transferred with positive biomarkers but
already trending down at OSH. Event possibly from OSH admission
when she developed respiratory failure from bilateral PNA, or
shortly after discharge. Had diffuse disease now s/p 4 DES to
LAD. Medical regimen includes aspirin, beta blocker, plavix,
statin. Also encouraged smoking cessation, nicotine patch use.
No further complaints of chest pain during hospitalization.
Please note that she should have her aspirin dose reduced to 81
mg on [**2178-5-19**] (i.e. 4 weeks after her cath). [**Last Name (un) **]

2. Acute on chronic systolic and diastolic HF: Had crackles all
the way up the lung fields bilaterally on admission. She
diuresed with good response to lasix 40 IV. EF in [**12-6**] was
45-50%, now 40-45%. She was continued on her blocker and [**Last Name (un) **]
(initially held with hypotension but restarted as hypotension
resolved). Exam improved with diuresis.

3. COPD: Increased sputum production and wheezing as well as
hypercarbia suggestive of COPD flare. Was treated with
levofloxacin 5 day course and steroid taper, which she had still
been on from her last COPD flare. Sputum culture with yeast and
1 colony of mold, no clinical evidence of infection. She was
continued on her inhaler regimen, and started on tiotropium.

4. Afib/Arrhythmias: Pt developed
