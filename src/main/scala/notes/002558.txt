Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 783**]
Chief Complaint:
Mechanical Fall w vertebral fracture

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
orthopedic surgery fixation of thoracic spine
intubation
mecanical ventilation
[**First Name3 (LF) **] transfusion


History of Present Illness:
This is a 64 yo F with PMHx of OSA on CPAP, DMII, CKD baseline
2.5, HTN, dCHF (LVEF >55%), peripheral neuropathy, morbid
obesity, asthma, hypothyroidism and anxiety who was transferred
to [**Hospital1 18**] s/p mechanical fall from OSH ED ([**Hospital 36837**] Healthcare.
The patient fell down 10 stairs at her son's house. Per report
there was possible LOC and head strike, CT head in OSH ED
negative for ICH or fracture, but positive for subgaleal
hematoma at the vertex. CT spine showed T10 vertebral body fx,
T8-10 spinous process fx and R tranvsverse fx of T11-12. She was
briefly hypotensive in the ED, SBP nadir 80s with improvement to
133 after 1L NS and was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further
management. At OSH ED she also got Zofran, Tylenol, Lidoderm
patch.

In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, VS 109/38 64 20 98% 2L. Admission labs notable
for K 6.2 (not hemolyzed), Cr 3.3 (baseline 2.0-2.5), HCT 29
(baseline 32-35), INR 1.0, CK 2056. There were no EKG changes
and she received 10U Regular Insulin, 1 amp D50 and Kayexalate
x1, with improvement in her K to 5.8, but worsening renal
failure (Cr 4.2) and rising CK (3045). She was seen by ACS and
Ortho Spine and was neuro intact, no urinary retention or
incontinence of bowel or bladder. She is being transferred to
medicine for [**Last Name (un) **] and hyperkalemia, plan for OR tonight with
Ortho-Spine for stabilization of transverse T11-12 fractures.
Consulting services are ACS, Ortho-Spine and Neurosurgery.
Documented UOP 300cc in past 12 hours. She was seen by ACS and
Ortho Spine and was neuro intact, no urinary retention or
incontinence of bowel or bladder.

ROS: The patient says she has had increased muscle/joint aches
recently which she attributes to OA. She has felt increasingly
disoriented and dizzy recently. She says her vision has seemed
cloudier recently.
