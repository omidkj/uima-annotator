Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5141**]
Chief Complaint:
syncope and pleuritic chest pain upon waking

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 67 year old female with epilepsy, hypertension,
and pancreatic cancer s/p Whipple with positive margin who is
currently undergoing chemotherapy and radiation.  She had a
syncopal episode after returning home from a radiotherapy
session today and was initially seen at an OSH where she was
diagnosed with bilateral PEs.  She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] and
admitted to the ICU for further management.
.
After returning home from her radiotherapy session today, she
had a syncopal episode as she was entering her home.  Her
husband was next to her and managed to lower her to the ground
as she fell.  She did not strike her head or sustain any other
injuries.  She reports losing consciousness and waking up
several minutes later.  She reports that it was very different
than prior seizures and there was no evidence of seizure
activity.  After waking, she felt SOB with new bilateral chest
and back pain on inspiration.  She felt somewhat better after
resting, but once again felt SOB, weak, and dizzy later in the
day when getting up to the bathroom.  EMS was called and she was
brought to the [**Hospital3 417**] ED.  While there, she was tachy to
the 140s with BP in the 80s-90s, and CTA showed bilateral PEs
and evidence of right heart strain.  She was started on a
Heparin drip and received several liters of IV fluids.  She was
given Zofran 4 mg IV and Ativan 1 mg PO for nausea.  She was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] per patient request.
.
In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, her initial vitals were T 98.3, HR 116, BP
103/67, RR 18, SpO2 98% on 3L.  She was on a Heparin drip at
1000 units/hr.  She complained of continued pleuritic chest pain
and back pain worse with inspiration.  EKG showed sinus
tachycardia at 113 bpm and slight ST depressions in the lateral
leads, as well as a mild S1Q3T3 pattern.  She was given
Acetaminophen 1000 mg, which she reports helped the pain
significantly.  Her Heparin drip was titrated and she was
admitted to the ICU for further management.
.
Once in the ICU, she reported feeling much better than earlier,
but with some continued pleuritic chest pain.  She reports
having a long history of varicose veins, but noted a recent
palpable vessel on her medial right thigh near the knee which
worsened and then improved a few days ago.  She has chronic LE
edema and venous stasis changes.  She has lost about 50 lbs
since her diagnosis with pancreatic cancer.  She has chronic
nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea related to her chemotherapy and
radiation.  She has had difficulty staying hydrated, requiring
periodic IV fluids in [**Hospital **] clinic.


Past Medical History:
# Pancreatic Cancer -- as below
# Epilepsy -- (Neurologist Dr [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 449**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] in [**Hospital1 1474**] MA)
-- No seizure in about 5 years
# Psoriasis
# Basal cell carcinoma of the skin, status post excision
# Hypertension -- now resolved
# Tonsillectomy History
.
ONCOLOGIC HISTORY:
# Pancreatic Cancer -- stage IIB (pT3, pN1, M0)
-- Summer [**2184**] developed epigastric discomfort
-- Few months later obstructive jaundice
-- [**2185-11-21**]: CT scan at [**Hospital1 18**] showed mass in the pancreatic
uncinate process
-- [**2185-12-8**]: Whipple procedure with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 468**]
-- Pathology showed a 2.4-cm moderately differentiated ductal
adenocarcinoma in the head of the pancreas.  One of the 11 lymph
nodes examined was positive, although it was noticed that the
single lymph node that contained carcinoma appeared to be
involved by direct contiguous tumor growth. The primary tumor
was extending beyond the pancreas, but without involvement of
the celiac axis or superior mesenteric artery.  The uncinate
process margin was positive for carcinoma.  There was no
vascular or lymphatic invasion but there was extensive
perineural invasion.
-- [**2186-1-12**]: Started cycle 1 of chemotherapy with Gemzar.
-- [**2186-2-2**]: Cyberknife therapy to positive margin.
-- [**2186-2-9**]: External beam radiation and concomitant XELODA.
-- [**2186-2-22**]: Xeloda held due to GI toxicity.

# Father -- Died at age 63 of MI.

IMAGING:
ECHO [**2186-3-16**]: Conclusions
The left atrium is normal in size. The left ventricular cavity
is unusually small. Left ventricular systolic function is
hyperdynamic (EF>75%). The right ventricular cavity is
moderately dilated with moderate global free wall hypokinesis.
There is abnormal septal motion/position consistent with right
ventricular pressure/volume overload. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and
no aortic stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral
valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Severe [4+]
tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. [In the setting of at least
moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation, the estimated
pulmonary artery systolic pressure may be underestimated due to
a very high right atrial pressure.] There is a very small
pericardial effusion. There is an anterior space which most
likely represents a prominent fat pad.

CONCLUSIONS: Small underfilled hyperdynamic left ventricle.
Right ventricular systolic dysfunction with relative
preservation of the right ventricular apex consistent with acute
RV strain in the setting of her known PE. Likely severe
pulmonary artery systolic pressure.
