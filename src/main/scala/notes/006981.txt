History of Present Illness:
Pt is a 69 yo female with hx significant for CAD, CHF, IDDM,
ESRD (on HD since [**2116**]), h/o PUD/GERD who was sent from dialysis
today for w/u of BRBPR and dropping hct(baseline 35,29 on [**9-2**]).
Pt notes that she was in her USOH until last Monday when when
she was feeling inc. fatigue at dialysis. That night she noticed
spots of BRB in toilet after tarry BM and blood streaking the
TP. She notes that this has continued with every BM since then.
Two days later, BP was low after dialysis and pt had syncopal
episode while standing up from seated position. She fell on the
concrete and hit her posterior head. No bleed. + LOC [**2-6**] sec. no
postictal period. Pt saw PCP next day and atenolol was stopped
but no further w/u done (ie scans/xray) for fall on previous
day. HCT at that time 31 and referred to GI for w/u of GI bleed.
Pt c/o chest pain today at HD. Per pt she has had continual
"croup feeling" in chest since fall last week. Pain extends from
post. occiput to neck/jaw area to b/l upper ant chest, wakes her
up at night. Pain is not relieved with tylenol or darvon. She
has had anginal pain in the past but notes that this is
different than typical anginal pain. Of note, she had echo [**4-4**], [**2120**]: Mild LAE, mild LVH, LVEF 50%. No
significant valvular regurgitation, mild hypokinesis of distal
inferior LV wall. S/p Cardiac cath [**2117-3-11**]: RVEDP 10,
LVEDP 14, LVEF 70% with normal wall motion. Calcification of all
coronaries. Distal 40%
LMCA. Ostial 50-60% LAD; 40% mid LAD. Proximal 50% LCX; mild
diffuse disease of three OM branches; 60-70% distal LCX.

distal
disease.
ROS: No F/C/NS.No SOB.+burning in upper epigastric area,
relieved with passing gas. +9kg wth gain despite [**Month (only) **]. appetite
X3-4 months. no diarrhea.min constipation.

Brief Hospital Course:
On admission to [**Hospital1 18**], patient's vital signs were as follows: T
100.3, BP 124/55, P100, R 18, 99%2L NC.  She was comfortable an
in no acute distress.  Hct was noted to be 23, and she received
3U PRBCs via cordis for anemia.  Anticougulation was reversed w/
FFP and vitK.  At that time, patient also started to complain of
chest pressure, described as a "croupy sensation" w/ radiation
to jaw and neck.  EKG was performed that demonstrated ST
depression in I, II, and AVL and inverted t-waves in II, III,
aVF, and V4-V6.  Cardiac enzymes showed CK 595, CKMB 30, Ind
6.7, Troponin 1.3.  Given her likely upper GI bleed,
anticougation was held and a cardiology was called for
developing ischemia.

After consultation with cardiology, it was felt that the new
ischemia was likely secondary to increased demand from GI bleed.
 Catheterization was not felt to be useful at that time b/c of
cause of ischemia and past cath that showed severe 3 vessel
disease that would not be amenable to intervention.  GI felt
that the patient's evolving cardiac status would be
contraindication to scope in addition to fact that the pt's HCT
was relatively stable and vital signs were within normal limits.
 Medical mngt w/ blood products and fluid were planned.

On HD#1, patient continued to complain of a small amount of
chest pain.  She was given IV morphine with relief of pain.  On
the morning of HD#1, the team was called for worsening chest
pain, and shortness of breath.  EKG was performed that had no
acute changes from previous EKGs.  The team felt that the
patient was in CHF, and a nitro drip was started.  After
starting on the nitro, pt had less SOB/cp.  F/u CXR showing
improving infiltrates.  ECHO was performed that demonstrated
mildly dilated LA, LV systolic function moderately depressed w/
hypokinesis if the entire septum and inferior wall, and 1+MR.

By HD#2, patient was doing well. She received one more unit of
PRBCs for hct of 28.  Renal scheduled hemofiltration for fluid
status.  GI felt that the pt should be continued to be medically
managed given cardiac status.

She was was transferred from the unit to the floor and continued
to be followed by cardiology and GI.  She received an aggressive
bowel regimen for constipation.  She had 1 episode of BRBPR on
[**2120-9-10**] without any symptoms and without a drop in hct.  It was
thought that this may have been due to straining as she had not
yet had a BM.  She had a BM on [**2120-9-11**] without BRBPR or melena.

She had HD on [**2120-9-11**] and was discharged home with services in
improved condition with follow up with cardiology and GI.
