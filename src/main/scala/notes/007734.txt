HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 71 year old male with
a history of asthma who presents to the [**Hospital 882**] Hospital
with acute shortness of breath.  On the day prior to
admission he was treated for his asthma.  He has a known
history of aortic stenosis for approximately five years.  He
was referred to the [**Hospital6 256**] for
further assessment and cardiac workup.  He was admitted on
[**4-28**] where a cardiac catheterization was performed showing
aortic stenosis with valvular gradient with 36 mm of mercury
with a valve area of approximately 0.8 to 0.9 cm squared.  He
had notably increased filling pressures with a wedge of 37
but a relatively preserved cardiac output of 5.5 and cardiac
index of 2.7.  He also had coronary artery disease with a 50%
proximal left anterior descending and distal left main
lesion.  He had an ostial obtuse marginal 1 70 to 80%
stenosis and insignificant right coronary artery disease.
His ejection fraction was depressed at approximately 30%.  He
was evaluated by cardiothoracic surgery for aortic valve
replacement and coronary artery bypass graft.  He has no
known history of syncope, occasional chest pain associated
with shortness of breath.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Aortic stenosis, asthma,
hypercholesterolemia, hypothyroidism, gout, newly diagnosed
diabetes mellitus.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Albuterol metered dose inhaler 1
puff p.o. q. 4 hours, [**Last Name (un) **]-Dur 300 mg p.o. b.i.d., Ativan 10
mg p.o. q.h.s., Synthroid 0.25 mg p.o. q.d, Beclovent 3 puffs
b.i.d., Indomethacin 25 mg prn, Xalatan .005%, GGT 1 o.u.
q.d., Doxazosin unknown dose and Glucosamine.

ALLERGIES:  He has no known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Significant for tobacco which he quit 25
years ago and alcohol which he quit 12 years ago.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Negative for claudication, negative for
transient ischemic attack, stroke, syncope.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Afebrile, vital signs stable.
His lungs were clear to auscultation.  His cardiac
examination, S1 and S2 regular rate and rhythm with a
systolic ejection murmur radiating to the neck.  His
extremities showed minimal edema.  He had palpable dorsal
pedal pulses.

LABORATORY DATA:  His baseline creatinine was 1.5.

ASSESSMENT:  At this point it was felt that he had
significant aortic stenosis with two vessel coronary artery
disease amenable to coronary artery bypass grafting.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  A cardiology consult was obtained.  A
pulmonology consult was obtained for his asthma and an
infectious disease consult was obtained given that he would
undergo an aortic valve replacement.

The patient was taken to the Operating Room on [**2194-5-5**]
by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 10102**] where a coronary artery bypass graft times
two was performed as follows, saphenous vein graft to left
anterior descending, saphenous vein graft to obtuse marginal
as well as an aortic valve replacement with a 21 mm
pericardial tissue valve.  The cardiopulmonary bypass time
was 213 minutes with a crossclamp time of 166 minutes.
Postoperatively the patient did well requiring Levophed for
pressure with some inotropic support and Amiodarone for
postoperative atrial fibrillation.  He was also placed on an
insulin drip.  His chest tubes were removed on postoperative
day #1 without complications and the patient was transferred
to the floor on postoperative day #2.  He at the time was on
Amiodarone for postoperative atrial fibrillation as well as
Coumadin.  He had a UM which was significant for white blood
count of 37 with positive bacteria which was treated with
Ciprofloxacin.  While on the floor he had a brief episode of
atrial fibrillation but remained well rate controlled.  His
electrolytes were checked and corrected and his rate was
controlled with Lopressor.  Other than that he did well,
ambulating early.  On postoperative day #4 it was felt that
he was stable for discharge.  He had remained afebrile with a
stable rate in the 70s and blood pressure of 100s/60s.  He
was making adequate urine and was clear to auscultation with
a regular rhythm.  His sternotomy site was without any
erythema, edema, induration or drainage and was stable.  His
extremities were well perfused with 1+ edema and his
saphenous vein graft site was well healed.

1.  Flovent 110 mcg metered dose inhaler 4 puffs b.i.d.
2.  Atrovent 2 puffs metered dose inhaler q.i.d.

10. Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d.
11. Zantac 150 mg p.o. b.i.d.
12. Aspirin 81 mg p.o. q.d.
13. Coumadin 5 mg p.o. q.d. for a target for INR of 2 to 3
14. Motrin
15. Serevent metered dose inhaler three puffs b.i.d.
16. Lopressor 12.5 mg p.o. b.i.d.
17. Ciprofloxacin 500 mg p.o. q.d. for one day and Percocet
one to two p.o. q. 4 hours prn pain.

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:  He is discharged with instructions
to follow up with [**Hospital6 407**] and his primary
care provider for his Coumadin dosing for a target INR of 2
to 3.  He was to follow up with his cardiologist and to
follow up with Cardiothoracic Surgery in four weeks.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Asthma
2.  Aortic stenosis status post aortic valve replacement
3.  Coronary artery disease status post coronary artery
bypass graft times two on [**5-5**]
4.  Hypercholesterolemia
5.  Hypothyroidism
6.  Gout

His INR on discharge was 1.1 after receiving two doses of
Coumadin 5 mg.
