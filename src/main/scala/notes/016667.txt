Service: NEUROLOGY

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 618**]
Chief Complaint:
unresponiveness

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
-R-hemicraniotomy

History of Present Illness:
Given pt's mental status, she was unable to give a history, so
history from pt's nephew and medical record.
.
HPI: 83 year-old woman with a history of afib on coumadin, HTN,
CAD, high cholesterol, DM presents with left hemiplegia, right
gaze deviation, and decreased responsiveness for an unknown
amount of time.
.
Nephew reports that he last saw pt on [**8-9**] and she was doing
well. Home health aide saw pt on [**8-11**], and pt also doing well.
Nephew says that he called her on Sunday [**8-16**] as he usually does
since he usually lays out allof her pills for the week. She did
not answer, and he left a message, which he reports is not that
unusual. He called her again last night as he had not heard from
her, and left another message. He then received phone call today
from Home Health agency that the aide was at apartment and could
hear noises inside but pt did not answer door. Nephew called 911
and went to her house.
.
Per EMS report, pt found lying on her back in bed. She was
minimally resposnive, only responding to pain with minimal
right-
sided movement. She did not move her left side. Breathing was
shallow, radial pulse was irregular and weak, capillary refill
was poor, skin was hot and diaphoretic. Vitals in the field were
230/100, HR 88-92, RR 24-29, FSBS 209.
.
On arrival in [**Name (NI) **], pt remained minimally responsive with left-
sided plegia. She was therefore intubated for airway protection.
She was tachycardic to the 170s with unclear rhythm, possibly
aflutter vs SVT, with BP 160s. She was given 6mg adenosine to
slow HR and try to identify rhythm. She then dropped BP to 60s
systolic despite IVF and was cardioverted x2 at 200J. HR slowed
to 100s with sinus rhythm and PACs and SBP 100s.
.

.
Neurologic Examination: (pre-intubation)
Mental Status: Opens eyes to loud voice/stimulation. Right gaze
deviation. Shows thumb to command, moves toes to command.
Minimal
verbal output. Drifts back to sleep without continued
stimulation.
.
Cranial Nerves: Did not blink to threat, bilaterally. Pupils
equally round and reactive to light, 3 to 2 mm bilaterally.
Right
gaze deviation, but does cross midline on doll's. Severe left
facial droop. Decreased corneal on left.
.
Motor: Normal tone, bulk bilaterally. No fasciculations or
tremor. Moves right side spontaneously and to command, at least
distally. Left arm and leg plegic with no spontaneous movement
or
to command, and only very minimal foot withdrawal to noxious.
.
Sensation: Withdraws/localizes noxious on right. Grimaces and
increased right-sided movmements to noxious on left though no
motor response.
.
Reflexes: DTRs decreased but symmetric at biceps, absent at BR,
patellar, ankle. Toes were mute bilaterally
.
Unable to assess coordination and gait given mental status.

.
CT head without contrast [**9-18**]:
There are multiple large right-sided right frontal hematomas.
Adjacent areas of low attenuation extend to and involve the
cortex. The distribution is in the anterior cerebral artery and
anterior division of the middle cerebral artery territory. These
findings could be consistent with a hemorrhagic stroke given the
appearance and distribution. There is 5 mm worth of leftward
midline shift. The perimesencephalic cisterns are preserved.
There are a few small areas of subarachnoid blood within the
left frontal region.
Incidental note is made of a large left maxillary retention cyst
or polyp.
IMPRESSION: Multiple large hematomas within the right frontal
lobe could be consistent with a hemorrhagic infarct but vascular
malformation and neoplasm are not excluded. Minimal midline
shift. Perimesencephalic cisterns are intact.
.
Carotid series:
Unremarkable exam. No stenosis in the extracranial carotid
arteries.
.
TTE:
The left atrium is elongated. The right atrium is moderately
dilated. No
atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D,
color Doppler or  saline contrast with maneuvers. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular  hypertrophy with normal cavity size
and systolic function (LVEF>55%). No  masses or thrombi are seen
in the left ventricle. Right ventricular chamber  size and free
wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
 thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic
regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no
mitral valve
prolapse. Mild to moderate ([**1-21**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid  valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The
estimated pulmonary artery systolic  pressure is normal. There
is a small pericardial effusion. There are no  echocardiographic
signs of tamponade.
.
CT head without contrast [**9-28**]: There is a large area of low
attenuation in the right frontal, parietal, and temporal lobes,
consistent with an infarction, which demonstrates slightly
decreased mass effect compared to [**9-24**], consistent with
evolution of infarction. Previously noted multifocal blood
products within this infarction appear less dense than
previously. There is no evidence of acute rebleeding. The soft
tissues overlying the right craniectomy site are not
significantly changed. The frontal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the right lateral
ventricle is less compressed. Periventricular white matter
hypodensity in the left cerebral hemisphere appears unchanged.
Decreased mass effect associated with the large right middle and
anterior cerebral territory infarction. Evolution of blood
products within the infarction without evidence of
rebleeding.Compared with the findings of the prior report (tape
unavailable for review)  of [**2131-4-2**], significant pulmonary
hypertension is no longer detected.  Otherwise, probably no
change.


Brief Hospital Course:
The patient is an 83 yo woman with a h/o DM, HTN, chol, CAD,
CHF, afib on coumadin, who was found in her apt on bed, with
left hemiplegia and right gaze deviation. As she was minimally
responsive whe was intubated. A head CT showed a right
ACA/superior division MCA stroke with hemorrhagic
transformation. CXR suggested LLL atelectasis vs consolidatio
