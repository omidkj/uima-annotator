HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 74-year-old
gentleman with a history of gastric CA who presented to [**Hospital1 18**]
for evaluation and management.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Prostate CA, status post XRT.
2.  Hypertension.
3.  GERD.
4.  Emphysema.
5.  URI.

ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1.  Lisinopril.
2.  Senna.
3.  Zantac.
4.  Tylenol.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:
1.  Status post appendectomy.
2.  Status post left knee surgery.
3.  Status post colostomy.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  The patient was pleasant
and cooperative, in no acute distress.  The heart revealed a
regular rate and rhythm.  The lungs were clear to
auscultation bilaterally.  The abdomen was soft, nontender,
nondistended.  The extremities were warm and perfuse.  No
edema.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was taken to the Operating Room
on [**2193-12-25**] where exploratory laparotomy was
performed.  The patient had multiple metastases so
gastrectomy was not performed.  The patient had two omental
biopsies, liver biopsy, and was transferred to the PACU in
stable condition and later to the floor.

However, on the floor, the patient's respiratory status had
decreased.  He required increasing amounts of oxygen until
finally he became unresponsive and hypotensive.  He was
intubated.  IV fluids were started and he was transferred to
the SICU.  He required levo for hypotension.

Chest x-ray showed a right infiltrate.  He was also started
on Lasix for pulmonary edema.  The patient did not require
levo by postoperative day number two.  Attempts to extubate
the patient on postoperative day number two and three failed.
We were not able to wean him off the ventilator.

He was extubated on postoperative day number four.  Over the
next few days he continued to have shortness of breath.  He
developed tachycardia up to 120-130.  His blood pressure
remained stable.  He was producing large amounts of mucus.
His chest x-ray was unremarkable except for a suspicious
opacification in the left lobe which was considered to be a
possible pneumonia.  The patient was started on levo.  He was
also started on Lopressor and then Diltiazem drip for
tachycardia control.

On postoperative day number six, the patient was started on a
combination of oral and IV Lopresor which seemed to control
his tachycardia much better.  There was a suspicion of
aspiration so a video swallow study was performed which
showed the patient aspirates some air when using a straw,
however, can drink normally from a cup without any
aspiration.

The patient's respiratory status has improved.  He was
started on chest PT which produced a large amount of mucus.
His shortness of breath has improved.  His heart rate and
blood pressure were under control.

He was transferred to the floor on postoperative day number
seven.  On postoperative day number eight and nine, the
patient continued PT and chest PT with improving strength.
His respiratory status is improving.  He has a little bit
less shortness of breath; however, he still requires 02.  He
was progressed to a general diet which he was tolerating
well.  He was passing gas and stool.

On postoperative day number nine, the patient was afebrile.
The vital signs were stable to 96-97% 02 saturation on 2
liters, producing large amounts of clear sputum (cultures
were negative to date on the oropharyngeal flora).  The
patient was ambulating with help.  No concerns.  No active
issues at this time.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Stable.

DISPOSITION:  The patient was discharged to rehabilitation.
The patient should continue his PT to a goal of independent
ambulation, chest PT with a goal of weaning off 02.  Regular
diet as tolerated.  The patient should not drink through a
straw.

FOLLOW-UP:  The patient should contact Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for a
follow-up appointment. The staples will be removed at
follow-up.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
1.  Sarna lotion applied to affected area p.o. q.i.d. p.r.n.
2.  Albuterol inhaler q. 4-6 hours p.r.n.
3.  Ipratropium inhaler q. six hours p.r.n.
4.  Beclomethasone inhaler two puffs q.i.d.
5.  Lisinopril 20 mg q.d.
6.  Percocet one to two tablets p.o. q. 4-6 hours p.r.n.
7.  Lopressor 25 mg t.i.d.
8.  Tamsulosin 0.4 mg q.d.
9.  Protonix 40 mg q.d.

DIAGNOSIS ON DISCHARGE:
1.  Gastric CA.
2.  Prostatic CA, status post exploratory laparotomy, omental
biopsy, liver biopsy.
3.  Hypertension.
4.  Respiratory distress.
5.  Pulmonary edema.
6.  Hypertension.
