Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 689**]
Chief Complaint:
Sepsis and respiratory failure

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Endotracheal intubation
Placement of arterial line


History of Present Illness:
59 year old female with a h/o Castleman's disease s/p
splenectomy, recurrent aspiration PNA necessitating recent PEG
placement on [**11-11**] who presents from [**Hospital1 599**] after her HHA called
EMS for lethargy and altered mental status.  Home health aide
notes that pt had large watery bowel movement on the day of
admission.  States that pt has been eating cheesecake and
pudding, though she is aware and has been instructed by multiple
MDs to remain NPO due to aspiration.  On EMS arrival, she was
febrile to 102F, and hypotensive to 80/50 with HR 70-80s. After
300mL NS in the field, BP increased to 90s.
.
In the ED she had a temp of 101.1F, HR 78, RR 16, and BP 100/65
initially and was found to have a RLL PNA on CXR, with lactate
of 2.5, given 4L NS for concern of early sepsis, developed
worsening respiratory distress, desaturation to 88% on 4L, and
was intubated. A left subclavian CVL was placed, she was found
to have copious secretions, with frequent suctioning. She was
given vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and flagyl in the ED after BCx
were drawn

Brief Hospital Course:
#  sepsis - Given history, this was thought to be most likely
secondary to aspiration pneumonia, given thick white sputum
suctioned on secretion, which grew strep pneumo, MRSA, and GNR
which were ultimately speciated as klebsiella. Blood cultures
were negative for growth on multiple occasions. Was on levophed
for two days, which was then weaned off. Was also found to have
an inadequate response to [**Last Name (un) 104**] stim test, and was given a seven
day course of hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone.  Completed
14-day course of vancomycin and zosyn. Initially treated with
Levofloxacin as well for double-coverage of gram negative
organisms, but was d/c'ed after consulting with infectious
disease team. Was also initially empirically treated with flagyl
for c. difficile colitis due to reported diarrhea prior to
admission by her caretaker. Flagyl was d/c'ed after 3 days once
stool samples were negative for c. diff x 3. Orthopedic surgery
was also consulted after chest CT revealed a chronic
sternoclavicular posterior dislocation with associated fluid
collection. It was not thought that this was a source of
infection, and ortho did not advise any intervention during this
admission.
Ms. [**Known lastname 14**] had significant improvement in her clinical status
and, although Klebsiella sensitive only to carbapenems was
ultimately speciated from her sputum approximately 10 days into
her course,it was decided not to treat for this, since it did
not appear to be clinically significant. Given pt's history of
Castleman's disease, it was also recommended that Ms. [**Known lastname 14**]
receive a pneumovax vaccination prior to d/c, given risk of
sepsis with encapsulated organisms.

.
#  hypoxic respiratory failure - Ms. [**Known lastname 14**] was initially
intubated with hypoxic respiratory failure, thought to be due to
aspiration pneumonia.  Due to concerns that pleural effusions
seen on chest Xrays and CT represented an empyema rather than
transudative fluid secondary to aggressive fluid resuscitation,
a R thoracentesis was done. Analysis of pleural fluid was
consistent with a transudative etiology, and pleural fluid
culture was negative for growth. After approximately a week of
weaning and pressure support trials, Ms. [**Known lastname 14**] was extubated.
Unfortunately, she quickly experienced hypoxia, dyspnea and
stridor, and failed racemic epi and heliox. Pt initially
indicated that she did not wish to be reintubated. After
discussions with her and her power of attorney, however, it was
ascertained that reintubation was acceptible to her, and this
was quickly done. Given possible laryngeal edema as etiology,
was placed on three days prednisone. She was also aggressively
diuresed, as she was grossly overloaded for the course of stay
due to aggressive volume resuscitation in response to sepsis,
and failure to extubate was thought to be partly attributable to
pulmonary edema. After three days, Ms. [**Known lastname 14**] was doing well on
pressure support and several SBTs, and she was extubated. She
did well following this, and was transferred to the floor
satting well on 4L NC.
.
# Sedation: Ms. [**Known lastname 14**] was kept alert but comfortable with
Versed and Fentanyl. This was weaned off once extubated. She
experienced some mild signs and symptoms of narcotic withdrawal,
and was placed back on a fentanyl drip transiently, and
restarted on her home dose of fentanyl patch, which had been
held during her early ICU course. Her fentanyl drip was then
titrated to off.
.
#  hypothyroidism - Ms. [**Known lastname 14**] was continued on her home dose
of levothyroxine.
.
#  Bipolar disorder - Was continued on her home doses of
lamotrigine and venlafaxine
.
#  FEN/GI - Ms. [**Known lastname 14**] received tube feeds through her PEG
during the course of her stay. Nutrition service was consulted
for assistance in monitoring her nutritional status. After
extubation, she continued to be kept NPO secondary to aspiration
risk.
.
#  Access - An arterial line and L subclavian line were placed
at admission. These were d/c'ed, and a PICC placed [**2-9**] for
continued antibiotic delivery.
