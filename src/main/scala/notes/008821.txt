Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3556**]
Chief Complaint:
SOB

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intbation
Mechanical Ventilation
Tracheostomy

History of Present Illness:
Pt is a 51 yo M with PMH of CHF and hypercarbic respiratory
failure requiring intubation who presents with several episodes
of SOB today. Pt called EMS, though thought SOB secondary to
anxiety. Denied CP, abdominal pain, no orthopnea or PND. Does
admit to worsening total body swelling/weight gain.
.
In the ED, initial vs were: T98.7 P87 BP150/83 R15 O2 sat93 RA.
On exam poor air movement and decreased breath sounds at bases.
EKG with no changes. CXR with no acute changes wiht ? pulmonary
edema. Patient was given lasix 20mg IV x 1. On repeat evaluation
pt was somnolent, difficult to arouse, awoke confused though AAO
x 3 when arrived. ABG with CO2 retention. Pt was placed on CPAP.
Initially he improved, though not quite oriented. On repeat
evaluation, ABG without much improvement. Decreased FIO2, RR in
30's. D-dimer sent was borderline positive. Pt was sent for CTA
PE and CT head. CT head notable for diffuse white matter
disease. Was able to undergo CTA on 2L alone without CPAP.
.
In the MICU, pt is on 2L NC. He was feeling well on arrival and
requesting food.
.
Review of sytems:
(+) Per HPI
(-) Denies fever, chills, night sweats, recent weight loss or
gain. Denies headache, sinus tenderness, rhinorrhea or
congestion. Denied cough, shortness of breath. Denied chest pain
or tightness, palpitations. Denied nausea, vomiting, diarrhea,

CXR [**10-19**]: Markedly limited study. There is suggestion of volume
overload.
Slightly more confluent areas are likely due to edema; however,
early
developing infiltrate cannot be excluded. Recommend repeat
radiography following appropriate diuresis and clinical
correlation.

CTA CHEST [**10-19**]
1. Very limited study, without evidence for large central
pulmonary embolism.
2. Apparent narrowing of the left lower lobe bronchus is
equivocal, however brochomalacia cannot be excluded.
3. 4-mm right middle lobe nodular density can be re-evaluated
with CT in one year. If there is history of malignancy, however,
earlier follow-up should be considered.

CT HEAD [**10-19**]
IMPRESSION:
1. Limited exam shows no acute intracranial process. Appearance
of the brain with ventriculomegaly out of proportion to cerebral
sulci and hypodensity in the subcortical and periventricular
white matter is unchanged from [**2133-8-11**]. Possibility of normal
pressure hydrocephalus cannot be excluded. To correlate
clinically.
2. Scattered paranasal sinus mucosal disease.
3. Small foramen magnum, a finding which is compatible with the
patient's
known achondroplasia.

ECHOCARDIOGRAM [**10-20**]
The left ventricle is not well seen. The right ventricular
cavity is dilated with depressed free wall contractility. There
is abnormal septal motion/position consistent with right
ventricular pressure/volume overload. The aortic valve is not
well seen. The mitral valve leaflets are not well seen.
IMPRESSION: Severely limited study due to patient's body
habitus. The right ventricle is probably dilated and hypokinetic
with pressure/volume overload. LV systolic function and valvular
function cannot be adequately assessed.


CT CHEST [**10-30**]
IMPRESSION:
Increased patchy opacities in the left upper and left lower
lobes since the CT on [**10-19**], suggestive of pneumonia. No
loculated pleural fluid, as questioned.

CT SINUS [**10-31**]
IMPRESSION:
1. Marked worsening of pansinusitis with polypoidal mucosal
thickening in a multiseptated right maxillary sinus and near
complete opacification of a
multipartite sphenoid sinus.

2. Unchanged ventricular dilation and extensive subcortical and
periventricular white matter hypoattenuation, better described
on prior
dedicated CT brain studies. The study is somewhat limited due to
obliquity of patient positioning within the scanner.

ADDENDUM :There is moderate soft tissue thickening around the
partially imaged oropharyngeal soft tissues; part of this could
be due
