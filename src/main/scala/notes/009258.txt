Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5438**]
Chief Complaint:
Hypercarbic resp failure, hypotension, altered mental status

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Bronchoscopy
Tracheostomy change
PICC placement


History of Present Illness:
This patient is transferred here primarily for hypotension from
[**Hospital **] Rehab. Prior to transfer here, she was hypercapneic and
required ventilation to reduce her pCO2.
.
The patient has had extensive recent hospitalizations. She had
Influenza A in [**4-10**] complicated by ARDS eventually leading to
intubation, ventilatory support, and tracheostomy. Complicated
by tracheocutaneous fistula. Returned for hypercarbic
respiratory failure -> ventilation through ET tube. She was
found to have a LLL PNA, paroxysmal rapid AFib (hr 180s) and
pneumomediastinum,
upper esophageal dilatation, and UTI. She underwent bronchoscopy
which was apparently unremarkable. Her course had been
complicated by hypotension requiring levophed and rapid AFib for
which chemical cardioversion was attempted unsuccessfully with
ibutilide.  Cultures revealed MRSA PNA/bacteremia, and
pseudomonas UTI, and treatment was initiated with vancomycin and
zosyn.
.
She was then admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] [**5-30**] after short stay at OSH for
workup of pneumomediastinum. Bronch at OSH revealed no defects
in the tracheal wall, and an esophageal gastrograffin study was
negative as well. Multiple imaging studies did not reveal any
pneumomediastinum. Repeat EGD/Rigid bronchoscopy did not show
any TE fistula, but the evidence for pneumomediastinum is that
respiratory symptoms (hypercarbic failure) and AF with RVR
became worse when ET tube was in higher position, and resolved
when ET tube was repositioned lower, presumably below the site
of a fistula. Her tracheostomy was revised and she had no
recurrence of afib with RVR. The may many attempts for pressure

support wean unsuccessfully so PEG was placed and she was
discharged to a chronic vent facility.
.
She was then recently admitted (discharged on [**8-2**]) for
psedomonas pneumonia and sepsis. She was treated with a 14 day
course of Aztreonam. This Pseudomonas was found to be
intermediate in sensitivity, but the regimen was completed
because of clinical improvement on the medication. She was
thought to have a cuff leak on this occasion despite elevated
cuff pressures.  She had a L PICC removed prior to discharge and
a new R PICC line placed. She also had in a R subclavian during
this admission.
.
At [**Hospital1 **], she was maintained on her trach mask and was found
to have Pseudomonas in her sputum.  Per their sensitivities she
was treated with Amikaicin and Ertopenem. But, 7 days past, she
had some changes in her mental status hence, ertopenem was
discontinued. This did not ameliorate her symptoms and 3 days
prior, her amikaicin was stopped. The morning of admission, per
report, she was SOB though with good sats, good PIPs, but
copious sputum and diffuse fibronodular disease (no
pneumopthorax or atelectasis) on CXR at [**Hospital1 **]. Later, she
became more lethargic; her BP was in the 90s (Normally in the
150s), her temperature was 96 and she was gassed and had a pCO2
of 130 (with pO2 >100). She was ventilated and her ABG was
7.3/77/110 when she was transferred here. Her last vent settings
were AC 22x450 FiO2 of 0.45 and 5 of PEEP.

[**2130-9-8**]: Successful placement of a double-lumen 37 long PICC
line via the left basilic vein with the tip terminating in the
lower SVC. The line is ready for use.
.
.
[**2130-8-28**]: CT of the chest: Overall, unchanged appearance of the
chest with scattered bilateral airspace consolidation and ground
glass opacities as well as bronchiectasis and bilateral pleural
effusions, these findings may represent chronic changes,
however, superimposed pulmonary edema/infection cannot be
excluded.
CT abdomen/pelvis: CT evidence of anemia as seen on prior exam.
Cholelithiasis without evidence of cholecystitis. No evidence of
bowel obstruction with free passage of oral contrast.  Thickened
left adrenal gland without evidence of focal lesion, which is
unchanged since [**6-10**].


Brief Hospital Course:
71f with chronic respiratory failure secondary to
influenza/ARDS, reccurent pseudomonal pneumonias, afib,
bronchiectasis admitted with sepsis and acute on chronic
respiratory failure.
.
# Resp failure: Felt to be a combination of chronic psudomonas
PNA, bronchiectasis, fibrosis, pleural effusions, mucus
plugging. Dead space calculated to be around 80%. Was on AC
during the initial portion of this hospitalization but was able
to wean to pressure support which she tolerated quite well, even
down to as low as [**11-9**] for over a week prior to discharge.  On
[**11-9**] with 40% fio2 she appeared comfortable, had good O2 sats
(mid-90's), and had a minute ventilation of around [**9-13**]
(300-400cc tidal volumes).  She had a trach change for trach
leak but continued to have trach leak even with new trach.  In
terms of dealing with the underlying etiologies, she was treated
first with meropenem for three weeks, then switched on to
colistin nebs for a two weeks on, two weeks off course (her
first two weeks ended [**9-25**] and should be restarted [**10-9**]).  She
was also put on scheduled albuterol and ipratropium MDI's and an
empiric taper of prednisone (she was discharged on 60mg daily
with plans to taper to 40mg daily on [**9-29**]; further taper per Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **], as below).  She is also being diuresed with furosemide
120mg IV daily to minimize any pulmonary edema, though this has
not been a significant problem.  She has a follow-up appointment
schedule with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], a pulmonologist at [**Hospital1 18**], f
