UNILAT LOWER EXT VEINS LEFT

Reason: r/o DVT

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
[**Age over 90 **] year old man with swollen, tender left leg
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
r/o DVT
INDICATION: [**Age over 90 **]-year-old man with swollen tender left leg. No
comparison is available.
No comparison is a vailable.

[**Doctor Last Name **] scale, color flow and Doppler images of left lower
extremity were obtained. The common femoral vein, superficial
femoral vein, popliteal vein demonstrate normal compressibility,
respiratory variation in venous flow and venous augmentation.

IMPRESSION: No evidence of DVT in left lower extremity

LEFT TIBIA AND FIBULA

CLINICAL HISTORY: Pain and trauma.

AP and lateral views were obtained.

No fracture is seen. Vascular calcifications and surgical clips
are noted.

IMPRESSION: No bony abnormality is seen.

CT, LEFT LEG WITHOUT CONTRAST: There is no fracture. No erosive
changes, lucent or sclerotic lesions, or periosteal reaction is
evident. An enthesophyte is seen along the quadriceps insertion
on to the patella. There is non-specific diffuse circumferential
subcutaneous edema surrounding the lower leg. No loculated fluid
collection or muscle atrophy is evident. Only a minimal amount
of the right leg was imaged, but on the portion imaged, similar
subcutaneous edema findings are noted.

Extensive atherosclerotic vascular calcifications are present.
Scattered surgical clips are present within the medial soft
tissues. There is a small knee joint effusion. Within the limits
of technique, the tendons about the ankle are unremarkable.

IMPRESSION: Non-specific subcutaneous edema, probably similar to
that partially imaged on the right side without focal fluid
collection or underlying osseous abnormality.

Conclusions:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular
hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is moderate regional
left
ventricular systolic dysfunction with focal akinesis of the
inferior wall and
hypokinesis of the inferolateral wall. The remaining segments
contract well.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular
filling pressure
(PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not
present. No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve.
Moderate (2+)
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse. No mass or vegetation is seen
on the mitral
valve. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to
acoustic shadowing,
the severity of mitral regurgitation may be significantly
UNDERestimated.]
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There
is no
pericardial effusion.

Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable
for review) of
[**2152-1-28**], moderate pulmonary artery hypertension is now
identified (not
measured on prior study). No obvious vegetations are identified
on the current
study. The severity of mitral and aortic regurgitation are
probably similar.
Elevated left ventricular filling pressures are present.

AP chest compared to [**6-29**] through 27:

Small bilateral pleural effusions have decreased substantially
and pulmonary edema is no longer present. Heart is normal size.
Right jugular line ends at the superior cavoatrial junction. No
pneumothorax.

Non-contrast CT of the head was performed.

FINDINGS:

The posterior fossa structures are unremarkable. The cerebral
parenchyma is normal in [**Doctor Last Name 352**] and white matter differentiation.
There is no acute intracranial hemorrhage, mass effect, shift of
normally midline structures or hydrocephalus. Prominent
ventricles and extra-axial CSF spaces, consistent with age
appropriate involution of the brain parenchyma was noted.
Bilateral maxillary retention cysts are noted, incompletely
evaluated on the present study.

IMPRESSION:

No
