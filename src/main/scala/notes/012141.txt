Brief Hospital Course:
75 yo female with multiple medical problems who presents with
back pain and difficulty ambulating but no evidence of any
fractures. Hospital course was complicated be hypotension and
hypoxia leading to mesenteric ischemic colitis and MRSA
pneumonia.

1. MRSA Pneumonia - patient was diagnosed with MRSA pneumonia
and so was started on Vancomycin 1000mg IV daily. She had a PICC
line placed, and will need an additional 2 weeks of total
antibiotics. In addition, given her history of COPD, she will
need aggressive pulmonary toilet / chest physical therapy as she
is at an increased risk of mucous plugging if she does not clear
well.

2. Mesenteric Ischemia - this was diagnosed on CT abdomen. This
was likely secondary to her being hypotensive for a long period
of time but throughout the hospital course, her diet was
advanced and she tolerated it well. Her abdominal exam was
benign.

3. Hypertension - her BP has been labile for most of the
hospital course, but we finally were able to reach a regimen
that was well tolerated by her. Given her history of renal
artery stents, our goal is to keep her SBP around 140s and so
she is currently on Diltiazem, and Isosorbide Dintrate.

4. CAD - she should continue her Aspirin, Plavix, and
Simvastatin

5. Back Pain - likey secondary to her osteoporosis with possible
compression fractures; she had plain films of her lumbar and
thoracic areas that showed no evidence of fractures or
misalignment. However, given her extent of pain, there was
concern for compression fracture but an MRI could not be obtain
due to her recent shoulder surgery and her history of renal
artery stents. At that time, it was decided to obtain a CT of
her lumbar and thoracic area that also did nto show any
fractures - only some foramenal narrowing. Her pain was
initially controlled with Ultram, Oxycodone, and Valium but she
had an episode of becoming hypotensive and so her pain
medications were switched around to Tylenol around the clock,
with Calcitonin nasal spray.

6. Renal - she is s/p stent to the R renal artery from stenosis;
she was seen by the Renal team who agreed with our current
medication plans. Her baseline Creat is between 1.4 and 1.7 and
she is well below her baseline at this the time of discharge.
