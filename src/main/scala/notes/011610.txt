Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 99**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath, R vocal cord paralysis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
PEG to GJ tube
Tracheostomy
Radiation therapy


History of Present Illness:
69 yo woman with h/o colon CA (s/p chemo and XRT), COPD, mitral
valve mechanical valve replacement, afib, recently diagnosed
with NSCLC. Patient with 2 month h/o hoarseness and dysphagia
and neck CT showing node compressing R recurrent laryngeal
nerve. Later found to have non small cell lung CA by bx.
Abdominal and head CT were negative for metastatic dz. Required
trach ([**2168-7-21**])and PEG ([**2168-7-15**])for vocal cord paralysis
secondary to b/l vocal cord paralysis and inability to protect
airway. Trach also placed for dyspnea and possible glotic
component.

[**2168-8-1**] patient found to have hemoptysis by tracheostomy tube,
hypoxemia--> 82% and hypotension. She was transferred to the
[**Hospital Unit Name 153**] where fluid was given and patient was started on
antibiotics for group b strep bacteremia as well as coag
negative staph. She was started on levoquin on [**2168-8-1**] for
questionable pneumonia and kept on levoquin for group b strep
bacteremia. Ruled in for MI by enzymes--presumed demand ischemia
in absence of CK elevation or ST elevations. A fib was rate
controlled with beta blocker (metoprolol) and amiodarone. Pt was
also placed on mechanical ventilation through her trach to
reduce myocardial oxygen demand. She improved hemodynamically
with increase of BP from 100/70 on admission to 130s.
Bronchoscopy showed no source of bleeding and presumed bleeding
from aggressive suctioning. Therapeutic thoracentesis was
performed for R sided effusion--proved to be transudate. Pt was
weaned from ventilator and called back to the floor on [**2168-8-8**].

Pt continued her XRT upon transfer to OMED service. On the night
of [**2168-8-12**] patient fell and had a negative head CT (without
contrast) with no events noted on telemetry. On [**2168-8-13**] patient
became more lethargic and nonverbal. Neurological exam was noted
to be non-focal. In the evening she was responding to yes/no
questions by shaking head but not opening eyes. Stat repeat head
CT was negative for hemorrhage. At 5 pm patient with increasing
O2 requirements. O2 sats were 85-90% on 35-40% via trach collar
and increasing respiratory distress was noted throughout the
night; she was using accessory muscles for breathing. 4 pm ABG
7.38/77/54 on 50% trach mask and at 6pm 7.41/67/53 on 60% trach
mask. Patient was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for impeding
respiratory failure. Of note, pt serum bicarb had been
increasing from 30--->40 at time of second admission to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].

Studies:

CT chest: 1. Right apical spiculated nodule and mediastinal and
right supraclavicular lymphadenopathy. The differential
diagnosis includes nonsmall cell cancer with extensive
mediastinal involvement or small cell lung cancer. The
appearance of the mediastinal nodal mass with confluent features
and encasement of vessels suggests the possibility of lymphoma.
Given that there is biapical scarring, the spiculated lesion in
the right apex could possibly relate to nodular scarring.
Finally, metastatic disease should be considered from unknown
primary.
2. Moderate-to-severe emphysema.
3. Cardiomegaly with notable enlargement of the right and left
atria. Patient is status post mitral valve replacement.

Swallow eval: Aspiration, spontaneous cough does not clear the
airway. For further details, refer to report from Speech
Therapy.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

Right supraclavicular lymph node: Poorly differentiated
carcinoma (non small cell). Tumor cells stain for CK-7 and
TTF-1, consistent with a lung origin.

Metastatic work-up:
CT abd and pelvis: IMPRESSION: 1. Free intraperitoneal air. This
is most likely related to the recent gastrostomy tube placement
by the GI service. Correlation with physical exam and patient
status is recommended to exclude a pathological bowel
perforation. Of note, no oral contrast material or ascites is
noted in the abdomen.
2. New right pleural effusion and aspiration-like changes at the
left base since the prior chest CT.
3. Splenic infarction.
4. Marked distention of the urinary bladder to a calculated
volume of 770 cc. Does this patient have clinical signs of
urinary retention?
5. Thickened adrenal glands without discrete mass.
6. Marked biatrial enlargement.

MRI head: No convincing evidence for intracranial metastatic
disease.

Bone scan:  1) No evidence of metastases. However, evaluation of
the pelvis
is limited by tracer activity within the bladder. 2) Distended
bladder with
pooling of activity within the left renal collecting system

Brief Hospital Course:
1.) Non-small cell lung cancer--CT chest showed a 0.9cm
spiculated nodule in the R apex as well as extensive mediastinal
LAD. Thoracic surgery was consulted and a biopsy of the R
supraclavicular node was obtained, which showed poorly
differentiated non-small cell lung CA. It was thought that the
extensive hilar and mediastinal LAD was compressing the
recurrent larngeal nerves, with resultant vocal cord paralysis.
Initially, this was limited to the R VC. A swallow study at this
time found Mrs.[**Last Name (STitle) **] to be at great risk for aspiration of liquids,
so she was kept on a soft solid diet with no liquids. While in
the hospital, however, the paralysis worsened and came to
involve both vocal cords. Mrs.[**Last Name (STitle) **] was kept NPO, a PEG was placed
that was advanced to a GJ tube because of poor GI motility and
possible proximal obstruction.  Radation therapy was initiated
in the hopes of shrinking the mediastinal masses and relieving
the vc paralysis. Metstatic work-up for staging was done,
including a bone scan, head MRI and abd and pelvic CT-all of
which were neg for mets. While in the hospital, Mrs.[**Last Name (STitle) **] received
multiple treatments of XRT as well as formal mapping. Her
radiation oncologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] felt that she had completed a
course of palliative XRT and was not a candidate for further
radiotherapy.  Given her poor medical state, she was felt to not
be a candidate for chemotherapy.  After extensive code status
discussion with her family (please see below), Mrs. [**Known lastname 102718**]
code status was changed to comfort measures; she was
