PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Vital signs revealed a
temperature of 98.8, heart rate of 80, blood pressure of
98/52, respiratory rate of 16, oxygen saturation of 94% on 3
liters nasal cannula.  In general, cachectic.  Head, eyes,
ears, nose, and throat revealed mucous membranes were moist.
Pupils were equal, round and reactive to light.  Extraocular
movements were intact.  Neck revealed no jugular venous
distention appreciated.  Chest revealed coarse fibrotic
breath sounds bilaterally with occasional expiratory wheezes.
In addition, there were also some wet crackles.  Heart had a
regular rate and rhythm laterally and downward, displaced
point of maximal impulse with a murmur heard at the base of
the heart without radiation to the carotids.  Abdomen revealed
positive bowel sounds, scaphoid.  Extremities revealed
toenails with evidence of superficial infection.

RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  Electrocardiogram revealed sinus at 73
with left and right atrial abnormalities, left axis
deviation, supraventricular conduction delay.

A chest x-ray revealed no consolidations, no effusions, no
congestive heart failure.  Positive interstitial markings.

PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:  White blood cell
count of 4.6, hematocrit of 43.5, platelets of 101, mean cell
volume of 120.  INR of 1.7.  Sodium of 138, potassium of 4.9,
chloride of 100, bicarbonate of 29, blood urea nitrogen
of 25, creatinine of 8.4, blood glucose of 53.  Albumin
of 3.1, calcium of 8.5, phosphate of 6, magnesium of 2.
Blood gas revealed 7/121/115, sputum with 4+ gram-negative rods
and o/p flora.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted for hypercarbic
respiratory failure.

 1.  CARDIOVASCULAR:  The patient was maintained on
amiodarone for a history of ventricular tachycardia.  He did
not require pressor support.  He did not require diuresis.

 2.  PULMONARY:  The patient required oxygen at baseline, and
he was kept on nasal cannula oxygen throughout his stay.  To
correct his hypercarbia and hypoxia, he was initially placed
on noninvasive mask ventilation which resulted in marked
improvement of his respiratory status.  A repeat arterial
blood gas was shown to be 7.18/80/64 with a lactate of 0.4.
He was initially given steroids, but then these were
discontinued because it was felt that he was not having a
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation.  He was
started on levofloxacin and will continue a 10-day course,
finishing on [**2179-5-8**].  He was to be discharged on home
oxygen, and his primary care provider planned to give him a
BiPAP machine at home, hopefully to avoid need for
readmission.

 3.  RENAL:  The patient was maintained on hemodialysis
during his course.  He was changed from sodium bicarbonate to
baking soda, and he was given Nephrocaps instead of folate
and multivitamin.  He was followed in consultation by the
Renal Service while he was here.

 4.  INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  The patient was treated with
Levaquin 250 mg p.o. q.o.d. beginning on [**2179-4-28**]; to
continue until [**2179-5-8**].  He was also maintained on
lamivudine and stavudine in addition to prophylactic Bactrim.

 5.  GASTROINTESTINAL:  The patient was maintained on
Protonix, and he did not have any liver function tests
abnormalities.

 6.  HEMATOLOGY:  The patient was maintained on Coumadin for
his history of pulmonary embolism.  He was therapeutic during
his hospital stay.

 7.  FLUIDS/ELECTROLYTES/NUTRITION:  The patient was
encouraged to take p.o.

 8.  NEUROLOGY:  The patient maintained his mental status
without any changes once he was put on BiPAP.  He was
maintained on Zoloft and maintenance methadone.

 9.  LINES:  The patient had a dialysis cathether and a
central line.

10.  CODE STATUS:  The patient is full code.
