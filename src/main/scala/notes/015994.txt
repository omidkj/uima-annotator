History of Present Illness:
51 yo woman with EtOH cirrhosis recently hospitalized at OSH x2
days for hepatic encephalopathy who had three episodes of
small-volume hematemesis on the night of [**4-1**].  She had diffuse
abdominal discomfort and bloating associated with this.  She had
subjective (but not objective) fevers, chills, and sweats as
well as lightheadedness and dizziness.  These signs and symptoms
resolved spontaneously by the morning of [**4-2**].  At 2230 on [**4-2**],
however, she again began having small-volume hematemesis (less
than [**1-22**] cup total) and therefore came to the ED here.  She
continues to have abdominal discomfort, bloating, and
distension.  Her f/c/s persist.  She reports watery, black
stools for the past week but denies BRBPR or melena.  There has
been no chest pain, dyspnea, cough, dysuria, or LE edema.

5. childhood pyelonephritis

Social History:

EGD3/16
Blood in the stomach body. Pt may have bled from either
esophageal varices or portal gastropathy
Mosaic and giraffe skin appearance in the fundus and proximal
body compatible with portal gastropathy.
Varices at the lower third of the esophagus (ligation).

EGD [**4-15**]
Varices at the lower third of the esophagus (ligation).
Snakeskinning and congestion in the stomach body compatible with
portal gastropathy.
Otherwise normal egd to stomach body.

Brief Hospital Course:
51 yo woman with alcoholic cirrhosis admitted to MICU for upper
GI bleed due to esophageal varices, stabilized by banding.  Post
EGD course complicated by fever, thought due to left sided
nosocomial pneumonia, now on imipenum.

UGIB:
Presented with hematemesis and coffee grounds in NG lavage.
Underwent EGD ([**2137-4-3**]) grade II varices were seen in the
esophagus, no active bleeding but blood in stomach, s/p banding.
She was kept on an octreotide gtt for 5 days and protonix and
carafate.  Nadolol was held due to low SBPs and can be
reinitiated as an outpatient.  Repeat EGD on [**4-15**] with rebanding
was done.  She will follow up with the liver center and get a
repeat EGD within a month.

ID
* Fevers: Patient had fevers post her first EGD.  She was pan
cultured, a right pleural effusion was tapped and the pleural
fluid was transudative with neg cx, sputum cx with no s.
pneumonia, m. catarralis, or h. influenza; c diff neg, HIV neg,
BCx neg.  She was started on levo/flagyl for SBP prophylaxis on
[**4-3**]; ceftaz was added on [**4-6**] and she was changed to imipenem
on [**4-7**] (14 d course) when she continued to spike through this
broad coverage.  Additionally, a urine culture ([**4-5**]) had
enterococcus and MRSA [**Last Name (un) 36**] to [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] she received vancomycin
for a short course ([**Date range (1) 26124**]); subsequent UCX [**4-6**] neg; UCx
[**4-14**] pending on discharge.  She did not spike a fever after
vancomycin and initiation of imipenem, but did continue to have
temperatures in the 99-100 range. Her pulmonary processes were
improving by discharge (see below).
* MRSA History: The patient was on contact precautions while
admitted; repeat swabs were positive for MRSA.

Pulmonary:
The patient was noted to have a chronic right sided pleural
effusion on admission that was transudative on a diagnostic tap.
 The size of this effusion grew in serial CXRs and the left side
of the lung showed increased opacification consistent with
pulmonary edema/CHF.  Her oxygen requirement increased and she
was requiring a non rebreather mask.  The patient underwent a
right sided therapeutic thoracentesis on [**2137-4-5**] (-1.1 liters)
and was symptomatically improved briefly, but then worsened.
Subsequent CXRs revealed a new LLL opacity thought to be a
nosocomial pneumonia (?[**2-20**] EGD).  The patient's antibiotics were
changed as above (see ID).  She underwent another therapeutic
thoracentesis (-1.0 liters) on [**4-9**].  The patient's oxygen
requirement decreased after the second thoracentesis and
diuresis for CHF, but she was still requiring 2L NC with
ambulation; therefore she was discharged with home oxygen as
needed while ambulatory.

GI
*Alcoholic Cirrhosis: Patient has known cirrhosis per Dr. [**Name (NI) 8390**] notes. On SBP prophylaxis. Albumin was 3.0. Abd U/S [**4-8**]
with only trace ascites, not amenable to tapping.  She was
continued on lasix and spironolactone, and her nadolol was
continued apart from a brief period when it was held given her
low blood pressures.  She was discharged on 10mg nadolol, to be
titrated up as tolerated.  Lactulose was continued.
*Liver nodule: Her abdominal U/S also showed a hyperechoic
nodule in the R lobe of the liver which was concerning for HCC
with an AFP of 8.7.  This should be followed up as an outpatient
with an MRI.

Heme
* Coagulopathy: Likely a sequelae of cirrhosis; INR was >3.0
early in her hospitalization. While admitted she received 2
units of FFP and 3 days of vitamin K 10mg sc q day.  Her INR
prior to discharge was 1.8.
* GIB: the patient received PRBCs for a falling HCT prior to her
banding.

Access:
R IJ [**2137-4-7**]; removed [**4-14**] and midline placed for completion of
IV antibiotics.

F/E/N:
Hyponatremia ? [**2-20**] cirrhosis:  The patient was free water
restricted; all meds in normal saline.
