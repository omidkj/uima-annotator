Service:  CSU


HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 46-year-old man
with known anomalous right superior pulmonary vein draining
into the superior vena cava.  Magnetic resonance imaging scan
performed on [**2167-10-14**] showed an ejection fraction of 60
percent with hypokinesis of the right ventricle.  His QP/QS
was 1.7 consistent with a significant intracardiac shunt.  A
catheterization was performed on [**2168-5-18**] which showed
normal coronary arteries and again an anomalous pulmonary
vein.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  His blood pressure was 120/80, heart
rate was 70 and regular, and he had a 2/6 systolic murmur.
Lungs were clear bilaterally.  Abdomen was slightly obese,
but soft and nontender.  No masses palpable.  Neurological
exam was normal.  He had palpable lower extremity pulses and
no lower extremity edema.

LABORATORY FINDINGS:  Potassium was 4.1, sodium was 134,
chloride 100, BUN 13, creatinine 1.0, calcium 8.9, white
blood count 8900, and hematocrit was 43 percent.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for diabetes mellitus and
he is being treated with oral medication.  After the
different treatment options were explained to the patient and
his wife, they elected to proceed with repair of the
anomalous pulmonary vein.  This was performed on [**2168-5-30**].
At that time, a baffle was created between the anomalous
pulmonary vein and the foramen ovale.  This was performed
using glutaraldehyde-treated autologous pericardium.
Postoperatively, he had some problems with pain control and
had atrial fibrillation, but this was converted to sinus
rhythm prior to discharge.

At the time of discharge, he is ambulating without
assistance.  He is tolerating a regular diet.  He is to see
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in 2 weeks in followup and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] also in
2 weeks.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:  Anomalous right superior pulmonary
vein.

Congestive heart failure.

Diabetes mellitus.

Chronic cough.

Status post repair of anomalous pulmonary vein.
