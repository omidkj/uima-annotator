catheterization [**2185-6-10**] that revealed significant coronary
artery disease. cardiac surgery consulted for revascularization.

Findings
LEFT ATRIUM: Dilated LA. No spontaneous echo contrast in the
body of the [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] LAA. Good (>20 cm/s) LAA ejection velocity.
RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: No spontaneous echo contrast in
the body of the RA. Normal interatrial septum. No ASD by 2D or
color Doppler.
LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thickness. Mild (non-obstructive)
focal hypertrophy of the basal septum. Top normal/borderline
dilated LV cavity size. Mild-moderate regional LV systolic
dysfunction. Mildly depressed LVEF. No resting LVOT gradient.
RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.
AORTA: Normal aortic diameter at the sinus level. Focal
calcifications in aortic root. Normal ascending aorta diameter.
Normal descending aorta diameter. Simple atheroma in descending
aorta.
AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS.
No AR.
MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. Mild
mitral annular calcification. Trivial MR.
TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets with trivial
TR.
PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflet.
No PS. Physiologic PR.
PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.
GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify I was present in compliance with HCFA
regulations. The patient was under general anesthesia throughout
the procedure. No TEE related complications. The patient appears
to be in sinus rhythm. Results were personally reviewed with the
MD caring for the patient.
REGIONAL LEFT VENTRICULAR WALL MOTION:
    N = Normal, H = Hypokinetic, A = Akinetic, D = Dyskinetic
Conclusions
Pre-CABG
The left atrium is dilated. No spontaneous echo contrast is seen
in the body of the left atrium or left atrial appendage. No
spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body of the right
atrium. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. There is mild
(non-obstructive) focal hypertrophy of the basal septum. The
left ventricular cavity size is top normal/borderline dilated.
There is mild to moderate regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction with hypokinesis of the septum, anteroseptal, and
anterior walls. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
mildly depressed (LVEF= 40%). Right ventricular chamber size and
free wall motion are normal. There are simple atheroma in the
descending thoracic aorta. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are
mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. There is no
pericardial effusion.
Post-CABG
The patient is AV-paced and on a phenylephrine infusion. Right
ventricular systolic function is unchanged. Left ventricular
systolic function is slightly improved with better movement of
the anterior wall. LVEF 50%. Mitral regurgitation and tricuspid
regurgitation remains trace. The thoracic aorta is intact post
decannulation.

Final Report: PA and lateral chest compared to [**6-17**]. Small
bilateral pleural effusions are little changed since [**6-17**].
There is no pneumothorax, pulmonary edema, or appreciable
atelectasis. Cardiomediastinal silhouette has a normal
