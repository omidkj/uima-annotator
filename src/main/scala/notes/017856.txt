Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 898**]
Chief Complaint:
Transferred from outside hospital for further care of pontine
hemorrhage

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Dobhoff placed under flouroscopy
GJ tube placed by general surgery


History of Present Illness:
The pt is a 67 year-old right-handed man with a PMH of HTN, HLD
and EtoH who was transferred from an OSH. This history is
compiled from his sister. Reportedly the patient had a fall 2
weeks ago for unclear reasons. It was not associated with LOC or
trauma but since then he has had several falls. He has not been
at baseline and has been falling and stumbling. None of these
falls has been associated with trauma or LOC. He has also seemed
more confused, especially in the last few days. His sister
called his PCP who suggested he decreased his BP meds. She tried
this without effect and decided to b bring him to [**Hospital1 2519**] today.

At the OSH his work-up included a head CT which showed a pontine
bleed as well as bilateral BG atrophy and encephalomalacia. His
screening labs were otherwise remarkable for a Platelet count of
251 and an INR of 1.12. His sodium was 131, K was 3.0 and the
Co2 was 91. His glucose was also elevated at 174 and his
troponin was 0.03. His ECG showed SR with a normal axis and no
ST changes.

Pertinent Results:
CTA chest ([**2149-7-13**]): No evidence of pulmonary embolus. Study
otherwise relatively unchanged from the previous CT of the chest
dated [**2149-7-9**].

Chest portable ([**2149-7-13**]): In comparison with the study of [**7-11**],
there is no evidence of acute focal pneumonia. The Dobbhoff tube
has been removed. Calcification of the hemidiaphragmatic pleura
on the right is again seen, consistent with asbestos-related
disease.

Bilateral lower extremity dopplers ([**2149-7-10**]): No evidence of deep
vein thrombosis of the right or left lower extremity.

CT head w/o contrast ([**2149-7-9**]): 1. Persistent area of
subacute/chronic hemorrhage within the pons, likely representing
expected evolution. No definite acute hemorrhage. MRI is
recommended again for further evaluation. 2. Persistent
ventricular prominence, which as stated before may represent
central atrophy versus communicating hydrocephalus and clinical
correlation is advised.

TTE ([**2149-7-1**]): The left atrium and right atrium are normal in
cavity size. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and
global systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%). Due to
suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality
cannot be fully excluded. Transmitral and tissue Doppler imaging
suggests normal diastolic function, and a normal left
ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). The aortic valve
leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve appears
structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is
no pericardial effusion. IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality.
Normal biventricular cavity sizes with preserved global
biventricular systolic function. No valvular pathology or
pathologic flow identified.

CT C-spine w/o contrast ([**2149-6-30**]): No acute subluxation or
fracture of the cervical spine. Multilevel degenerative change.

Brief Hospital Course:
67 yo M h/o HTN, ETOH abuse admitted for subacute pontine
hemorrhage [**6-30**], did well with rehab until [**7-6**] when found to be
aspirating.  Fever of unknown source on [**7-9**], but afebrile x48
hrs so broad spectrum ABX d/c'd [**7-12**]. Mental status altered but
suspect at new baseline. Hospital course was as follows:

Pt admitted to ICU initially. HCT c/w subacute pontine
hemorrhage. MI ruled out with cardiac enxzymes x3 and ECHO
completed. Pt transferred to [**Wardname 3709**] on [**2149-7-1**]. CIWA protocol
initiated and thiamine and folate started. Pt was stable. Speech
and swallow advance diet initially then patient was made NPO
secondary to aspiration risk. Pt ordered for MRI/A Brain with
contrast was ordered to evaluate for hemorrhage. Pt was returned
to the floor 2-3 times secondary to inability to cooperate and
or sit still even with Ativan. MRI/A was setup on an outpatient
basis. Rehab placement with PT/OT was pending. Pt was
hypertensive so home metoprolol was started on [**2149-7-2**] at 12.5mg
[**Hospital1 **] and zocor was started. Metoprolol switched to Amlodipine 5mg
PO daily and nystatin started for suspected thrush [**2149-7-6**]. On
[**2149-7-7**], patient was made NPO secondary to aspiration risk. Tube
feeds recs were Probalance 45cc/hr continuous with 75cc free
water flushes. On [**2149-7-7**], Duboff attempted without success
secondary to malformed nose from prior trauma then GI consulted
for PEG placement. LLL pneumonia suspected, IV Cipro started. GI
rec general surgery placement of gtube because an aspiration
risk during the procedure. General surgery accepted. On [**2149-7-9**],
pt became febrile 103 in the OR and tachcardic to 80-100. Pt
completed a septic work-up on the floor (bcx, Ucx, a prior CT
chest was completed the day prior). Vanco, Fluconazole, and
Flagyl started for aspiration pneumonia. Pt was tranferred to
Medicine. NPO, afebrile and at baseline level of mentation. On
medicine floor, other active issues were as follows:

1. Hypoxia - Currently satting 96% on 2L. Source of hypoxia is
unknown. No focal consolidation on chest radiograph. No evidence
of pulmonary embolism by CT scan. Smoking history and history of
COPD is unknown. No crackles heard on anterior auscultation.
History of asbestos exposure with changes seen on CT, but
unlikely to be source of acute hypoxia. ?relation to pontine
hemorrhage, although patient with normal respiratory rate. No
clear source was seen. Continued to wean patient.

2. Stroke - No changes seen. Poor mental status with limited
responsiveness. Makes eye contact. Question if this is patient's
new baseline. Cause unknown - hypertension vs. cavernous
aneurysm. Goal was to control blood pressure with goal of
140-180. Continued PT and OT.

3. Fevers - Afebrile x96 hours. Antibiotics d/c'd on [**7-12**]. No new
intervention was taken.

4. Hypertension - Blood pressure elevated this morning to
systolic BP 180. Continue HCTZ 12.5mg PO daily via PEG tube.
Increased ACE inhibitor to 6.25mg PO TID daily via PEG tube.

5. Nutrition - s/p PEG tube placement [**7-12**]. Spoke to nutrition,
which recommended continuing Probalance regimen. Patient should
have repeat swallow study in [**3-8**] days.

6. Hypokalemia - Persistent, 3.2 this morning. Cause unknown.
Renal function is fine at this time. Continued to replete as
needed.

7. EtOH abuse - CIWA d/c'd early in admission [**1-4**] no signs of
withdrawal. Continued folic aci
