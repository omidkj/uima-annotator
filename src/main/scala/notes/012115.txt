Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 425**]
Chief Complaint:
dyspnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 69M with DM, HTN, past smoking hx, hx of stroke
([**2175**]), family hx of premature CAD (brother with CHF and death
at age 50) who presents with 4 hours of dull upper back pain
that radiated to his bilateral shoulders and down to his right
elbow. this was associated with nausea, lightheadedness and SOB.
Patient reports that he was not having DOE, has been able to
walk a flight of stairs and noticed no decrease in exercise
tolerance recently. The CP was also associated with slight
nausea and "gastritis" for which he [**Last Name (un) **] rolaids and baking
soda without relief. Patient's pain was concerning enough that
his family called EMS.
.
family reports that he's had progressive DOE and decreased
exercise tolerance.
.
Of note, patient has had progressive DOE over the past [**6-3**]
months although denies any new PND or orthopnea. He denies any
recent weight gain or leg swelling. he has had a >50lb weight
loss over the past several months on account of a "gluten"
allergy and avoidance of carbohydrates.
.
As per the family, patient hasn't had any recent coughs or cold,
cough, although may had have a high salt diet over the past 24
hours.
.
On route patient was given 80 IV lasix by EMS and SLNG x 4
without relief of his pain.
.
ED Course: In the ED patient was given Amiodarone 300 IV for SVT
w/ aberrancy vs. VT. Vitals in the ED were:
T: 101.3 133 135/85 32 80%
Patient was given Levaquin for fever and possible pneumonia.


Past Medical History:
Prostate Cancer
CVA
PVD
CRI (baseline Cr 3.3)
? hx of CP in the past at age 34
GERD


Social History:
Social history is significant for the absence of current tobacco
use. Patient does have a 80 pack yr smoking hx although quit ~
20 yrs ago. Patient does have a history of alcohol abuse
requiring hospitalization, although has had no recent struggles
with EtOH and drinks occassionally. Patient's last drink was
several hours prior to admission.

Family History:
There is a family history of premature coronary artery disease
or sudden death - brother with CHF and died at age 50.

Physical Exam:
:98.1 HR:110 BP:130/80 RR:27 O2: 100 CPAP PEEP 12 PS 5
Blood pressure was 130/80 mm Hg while seated. Pulse was 110
beats/min and regular, respiratory rate was 27 breaths/min.
Generally the patient was well developed, well nourished and
well groomed. The patient was oriented to person, place and
time. The patient's mood and affect were not inappropriate.
.
There was no xanthalesma and conjunctiva were pink with no
pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa. The neck was supple with
JVP of 3 cm. The carotid waveform was normal. There was no
thyromegaly. The were no chest wall deformities, scoliosis or
kyphosis. The respirations were labored and there was use of
accessory muscles. The lungs had diminished breath sounnds with
rales presents at the bases bilaterally.
.
Palpation of the heart revealed the PMI to be located in the 5th
intercostal space, mid clavicular line. There were distant heart
sounds with no obvious thrills, lifts or palpable S3 or S4. The
heart sounds revealed a normal S1 and the S2 was normal. There
were no rubs, murmurs, clicks or gallops.
.
The abdominal aorta was not enlarged by palpation. There was no
hepatosplenomegaly or tenderness. The abdomen was soft nontender
and nondistended. The extremities had no pallor, cyanosis,
clubbing or edema. There were no abdominal, femoral or carotid
bruits. Inspection and/or palpation of skin and subcutaneous
tissue showed damp skin without stasis dermatitis, ulcers,
scars, or xanthomas.

Pertinent Results:
Imaging:
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2187-5-20**] 7:15 PM
Cardiac silhouette and mediastinum are within normal limits.
There is moderate-to-severe congestive heart failure with
increase in the pulmonary interstitial markings. There is
blunting of both costophrenic angles suggestive of small pleural
effusions.

CT PELVIS W/O CONTRAST  [**2187-5-21**] 11:03 PM
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of retroperitoneal hematoma.
2. Bilateral small pleural effusions and atelectatic changes.
Questionable 6-mm nodule in the right lung base. Follow-up is
recommended.
3. Atherosclerotic changes involving the aorta. Coronary artery
calcifications are noted.
4. Small liver hypodensity, not fully characterized, likely
represents a cyst.
5. Large left renal cyst.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2187-5-21**] 7:12 AM
IMPRESSION: Improving pulmonary edema.

ECHO Study Date of [**2187-5-21**]
Conclusions:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular  hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is mildly
dilated with severe global  hypokinesis. The apex is heavily
trabeculated. No definite thrombus is seen.  Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic  root
is mildly dilated at the sinus level. The aortic valve leaflets
appear  structurally normal with good leaflet excursion. Trace
aortic regurgitation is  seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
structurally normal. Mild to moderate ([**1-30**]+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure
could not be determined. There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
cavity dilation  and severe global hypokinesis c/w diffuse
process (toxin, metabolic,  multivessel CAD, etc.).
Mild-moderate mitral regurgitation. Dilated thoracic aorta.  In
the absence of a history of clinical infarction, a cardiac MRI
([**Telephone/Fax (1) 9559**] may be able to distinguish between and ischemic
and non-ischemic cardiomyopathy).

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2187-5-22**] 7:05 AM
Pulmonary edema has cleared. Only a small left pleural effusion
remains of previous small to moderate, bilateral pleural
effusion. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal. Large lung
volumes suggest obstructive airways disease.

ECHO Study Date of [**2187-5-23**]
Conclusions:
Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed
with global hypokinesis and akinesis of the inferior and
infero-lateral segments. Tissue  synchronization imaging
demonstrates borderline left ventricular dyssynchrony  with the
lateral wall contracting 45 ms later than the septum and RV free
 wall. Right ventricular systolic function is normal. The mitral
valve leaflets  are mildly thickened. Mild to moderate ([**1-30**]+)
mitral regurgitation is seen.  There is no pericardial effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2187-5-21**], no
change. This study suggests indeterminate benefit of CRTfor
heart failure.

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient is a 69M s/p NSTEMI & CHF.
.
#. CAD - Patient with NSTEMI, likely from underlying CAD given
multiple risk factors.  In the setting of CRI, it was determined
that the patient would not undergo cardiac catheterization and
medical management be preferred.  The patient was continued on
ASA, Aggrenox, Statin, Niacin.  Patient was also put on Toprol
XL in lieu
