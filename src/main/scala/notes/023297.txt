Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5893**]
Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
45M with past medical history significant for severe asthma with
>100 hospitalizations & 17 intubations who presents with
shortness of breath, wheezing, and cough for the past few days,
consistent with an asthma exacerbation.
  Patient says he was in his usual state of health until a few
nights ago when he felt incresing shortness of breath.  He was
also noticing some increasing cough with sputum.  No
fevers/chills.  No sick contacts.
  [**Name (NI) **] was recently admitted from [**Date range (1) 93487**] for similar
symptoms, thought to be [**1-29**] COPD exacerbation and was dc'd on a
5 day course of azithromycin.  He followed up with his
pulmonologist a week later who encouraged smoking cessation but
did not make and changes to his medications.
  He is very knowledgeable with regards to his asthma and
triggers, feels they are brought on by weather changes as well
as seasonally.  He self increased his dose of prednisone from 30
mg to 50 mg PO this morning.  Since his symptoms were not
improving, he decided to go to the ED.

  In the ED, initial VS were T 98.8, HR 127, BP 151/107, RR 18,
SpO2 99% RA. Labs were notable for lactate 4.0. Preliminary read
of CXR showed no acute cardiopulmonary process. EKG was sinus
tachycardia @ 122 bpm, consistent with prior. Patient received 2
Duo-Nebs (albuterol/ipratropium), 2 additional albuterol nebs,
magnesium sulfate 2g, and solu-medrol 80mg IV (pt requested only
80mg because he takes prednisone at home and has a h/o avascular
necrosis) with significant improvement in his symptoms. VS on
transfer were T 97.4, HR 106, BP 146/88, RR 16, 96%RA.

On arrival to the MICU, patient says he is breathing "at or
near" his baseline.  His VS were: 95  126/84   99   21  94% RA

IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process.

Brief Hospital Course:
Brief Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 45M with past medical history significant for
severe asthma with >100 hospitalizations & 17 intubations who
presents with shortness of breath, wheezing, and cough for the
past few days, consistent with an asthma exacerbation. He was
admitted to the ICU and treated with duonebs, magnesium sulfate,
steroids, and azithromycin for possible concominant COPD
exacerbation. He never required intubation and was weaned off
nasal cannula and returned to baseline. He was discharged to
home from the ICU.

Active Issues:
# Asthma/COPD exacerbation: Patient has h/o severe asthma with
>100 hospitalizations and multiple intubations and presented
with 2-3 days worsening dyspnea, wheezing and productive cough.
Pt's respiratory distress is likely secondary to asthma
exacerbation and probable COPD exacerbation given his h/o severe
persistent asthma on chronic steroids with continued tobacco
abuse. Environmental allergies, stress, tobacco are all likely
factors in acute exacerbation. CXR was negative for any focal
process/pneumonia, blood cultures are pending, and pt has
remained afebrile. Dyspnea improved w/ Duo-Nebs, Magnesium
sulfate and solumedrol 80mg IV in ED. In the MICU, pt received
albuterol/ipratropium nebs q6h with clinical improvement in
wheezing. He received solumedrol 60mg q6h on day of admission
and transitioned to prednisone po 60mg q6h on [**2178-8-25**]. Pt was
started on 4 day course of azithromycin (500mg on day 1, 250mg
day 2,3,4) to be completed on [**2178-8-27**], given suspected COPD
exacerbation.
