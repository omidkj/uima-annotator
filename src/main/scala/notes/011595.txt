Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Darvocet-N 100

Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 290**]
Chief Complaint:
Increased secretions and work of breathing


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
76 y/o M with PMH progressive MS s/p trach and G-tube placement
for recurrent aspirations, recent ESBL E. coli PNA transferred
from an OSH with hypoxia and hypotension.

The patient presented to [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] on the day prior to admission
after his trach tube had fallen out. His trach was replaced in
the ED, and he was subsequently discharged. He returned to the
[**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] with increased work of breathing, increased secretions
from his trach, hypoxia (74% unclear O2 delivery), and BP 69/59.
Per report, his trach was suctioned aggressively. A L femoral
central line was placed, and after 4L IVF his BP improved to
110/65 and HR improved to 100. At the time of transfer, he was
satting 98% on 12L humidified air via trach mask. CXR
demonstrated R-sided infiltrate/pneumonitis and his UA was
positive. Initial troponin was 0.2 and lactate 9.3. He was given
vancomycin, ceftazadime (h/o pseudomonas sensitive) and
gentamycin.

History of E. coli in urine ([**2160**]) resistent to bactrim and
flouroquinolones.  Patient admitted in [**7-/2166**] with hypoxic
respiratory failure and RLL aspiration PNA.  Due to
deterioration of MS in the acute setting as well as difficulty
extubation [**1-8**] recurrent aspiration, PEG and trach were placed.
Sputum culture grew Enterobacter resistent to ceftriaxone and
ceftazidime.  Treated initially with Vanc/Zosyn, then narrowed
to PO cipro.   In [**10/2166**], admitted to OSH with LLL PNA, ESBL E.
coli and treated with Ertapenem.

In the ED inital vitals were, 98 116 90/60 20 100% 15L. Lactate
3.1.  He was given 1L NS, then transferred to the ICU.

On arrival to the ICU, VS: 96.2; 126; 110/84; 22; 95% trach mask
15L; 40%. Patient has diminished mental status though unclear
whether this is close to his baseline. Patient is unable to
describe any further symtpoms, including chest pain and
shortness of breath.

Review of systems:
(+) Per HPI, son added chronic b/l LE weakness and right facial
droop
(-) Per son, HCP, denies fever, chills, cough, chest pain.

Imaging:
CXR [**2166-11-15**]- Large scale consolidation in the right lower lung,
predominantly lower lobe, was new earlier today compared to
[**11-1**]. It has grown slightly more radiodense over the past
eight hours, probably active pneumonia. Small right pleural
effusion is presumed and should be monitored in order to detect
any development of empyema. Left lung is clear.
Cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal. The patient has a
tracheostomy tube in standard placement. No pneumothorax.
.
CXR [**2166-11-16**] (following PICC placement)- Right PIC line has been
repositioned, tip is approximately 2 cm below the estimated
location of the superior cavoatrial junction.
Extensive consolidation right mid and lower lung zone stable
since [**11-15**], increased at the left base since [**11-15**]
consistent with worsening pneumonia. There is no pulmonary
edema. Heart size is normal. Tracheostomy tube in standard
placement.
