Allergies:
Morphine / Percocet

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2972**]
Chief Complaint:
shortness of breath, chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
82 yo M w/ CAD s/p CABG, multi PCIs, with chronically occluded
SVG-RCA., NSTEMI in [**2-3**], mod. AS, HTN, CRI, hyperchol, Prostate
CA, PVD, dementia, p/w SOB since 6am and CP (c/w chronic angina)
not relieved by NTG SL. The CP was described as worse w/
coughing. Per daughter, pt. has had poor PO intake and a dry
cough over the past week and has not felt well. EMS was called
[**1-30**] to his SOB. He was given ASA by EMS and transported to
[**Hospital1 18**].
In the ED: initial vitals were 100.4, 189/93, 92, 20, 95%2L NC.
A CXR showed a RLL consolidation and pt. was given 750 IV
levaquin. 1mg IV morphine for CP and was made CP free, 1L of
NS/K+, 40 po K+, 5mg IV lopressor.  Pt then desat. to 90% on 5L
and was placed on an NRB with impr. of sats to 98%. He was
started on a nitro gtt and given lasix 40mg IV. ECG changes were
noted (STD in I, avL, v4, v5) and trop was elevated to 0.71 (in
setting of ARF on CRI) pt was started on a heparin GTT,
cardiology was notified and rec. continued medical management. A
foley was placed w/ 1600ml of clear urine emptied. Now bloody,
therefore hep GTT was stopped. Admitted to icu for resp.
distress.

[**2140-2-15**] portable CXR:
Comparison is made with prior study performed four hours
earlier.
Moderate cardiomegaly is stable. There has been slight interval
worsening in asymmetric moderate pulmonary edema, worse in the
right side. There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
Patient is post-median sternotomy and CABG.

[**2140-2-15**]: Mild cardiomegaly has increased. There is
mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema asymmetric on the right, with
more dense consolidation in the right lower lobe. There is no
pneumothorax. If any, there is small right pleural effusion.
There are low lung volumes. The patient is post-median
sternotomy and CABG.

[**2140-2-15**] ECG 7 am:
Sinus tachycardia. Left atrial abnormality. Frequent atrial
ectopy. Left
ventricular hypertrophy. Compared to the previous tracing of
[**2139-5-27**] the rate
has increased, atrial ectopy has appeared and there is ST
segment depression
in leads I, II, aVL and V3-V6 consistent with inferolateral
ischemic process.
Followup and clinical correlation are suggested.

[**2140-2-16**] ECHO:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is moderate symmetric
left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size
is normal. There is mild to moderate regional left ventricular
systolic dysfunction with inferior/inferolateral hypokinesis.
Transmitral Doppler and tissue velocity imaging are consistent
with Grade I (mild) LV diastolic dysfunction. Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The ascending
aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets are
moderately thickened. There is moderate aortic valve stenosis
(area 1.0-1.2cm2). Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild to moderate
([**12-30**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing,
the severity of mitral regurgitation may be significantly
UNDERestimated.] The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests
impaired relaxation. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable
for review) of [**2138-5-6**], left ventricular systolic function is
now depressed.

[**2140-2-16**] ECG 1:30 pm:
Sinus rhythm with marked slowing of the rate as compared with
prior tracing of [**2140-2-15**]. There is Q-T interval prolongation.
Atrial ectopy has reappeared and the ischemic appearing ST
segment changes persist. Clinical correlation is suggested.
