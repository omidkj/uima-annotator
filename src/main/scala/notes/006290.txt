Chief Complaint:
Daily angina and increasing SOB

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:

History of Present Illness:
60 yo female with long-standing history of CAD with CABG x3 in
[**2097**], and subsequent DES to CX [**8-30**], complicated by CX

of general surgery for gallbladder eval/HIDA scanning. This
showed cholecystitis, and recent echo revealed severe AS. She
now presents with increasing angina, sometimes at rest, and
significant SOB with minimal exertion.

Pertinent Results:
[**2107-2-18**] CNIS: Bilateral less than 40% carotid stenosis.
[**2107-2-21**] Cath: Initial diagnostic angiography revealed a proximal
70% left subclavian artery stenosis with a 40 mmHg gradient
across the lesion.  The stenosis was proximal to the widely
patent LIMA-LAD graft, and thus the decision was made to stent
the lesion to improve flow to the LIMA. Heparin was used for IV
anticoagulation.  A 6F Shuttle sheath was used to engage the L
subclavian artery.  The lesion was crossed with a Magic Torque
wire that was then exchange out thru a catheter for a Supracore
wire.  A 7.0x29 mm Genesis bare metal stent was deployed across
the lesion at 12 ATM.  The stent was postdilated with an 8.0x20
mm baloon at 20 ATM.  Final angiography revealed 0% residual
stenosis, no gradient, no dissection, and normal flow.
[**2107-2-22**] Echo: Pre Bypass: There is severe symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. There is mild regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction with basal inferior hypokinesis. LVEF 45-50%. The
right ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. Right
ventricular systolic function is borderline normal. There are
three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets are
severely thickened/deformed. There is severe aortic valve
stenosis (area <0.8cm2). Mild to moderate ([**12-28**]+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The regurgitation is central with a vena
contracta between 3 and 5 mm. With provacative manuvers and
elevation of blood pressure and heart rate, mitral regurgitation
becomes at worst, moderate. There is blunting of the pulmonary
vein flow pattern. The mitral annulus meausres, on average, 3.3
cm. The leaflets are structurally normal. The aortic
regurgitation jet is eccentric, directed toward the anterior
mitral leaflet. The mitral valve leaflets are structurally
normal. Mild to moderate ([**12-28**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. Post
Bypass: Preserved biventricular function. LVEF 45-50%. No change
in wall motion. Aortic contours intact. Mitral regurgitation is
now trace. There is a prostethic valve in the aortic position
which appears well seated without preivavlvular leaks. Peak
gradient 31, mean 13 mm Hg. No AI. Post bypass cardiac output
calculated at 5.9 L/min. Remaining exam is unchanged. All
findings discussed with surgeons at the time of the exam.
[**2107-2-26**] Abd U/S: 1. Cholelithiasis without son[**Name (NI) 493**] evidence
of cholecystitis. 2. Prominent common bile duct with no
intrahepatic ductal dilation. 3. No ascites.
[**2107-2-27**] CXR: Increased size of small right pleural effusion.
Associated opacity in right lower lobe most likely atelectasis.
Continued mild CHF.

Brief Hospital Course:
Admitted on [**2-17**] for close monitoring given angina and SOB.
Carotid US revealed no significant disease. Dental consult done,
and multiple teeth extractions done [**2-20**]. Cardiac cath performed
[**2-21**] showed mod. diff. LM dz, EF 45%, patent CX stents, 100%
RCA, vein graft occluded, 70% left subclavian stenosis.
Subclavian stent placed at time of cath. Cipro started for UTI
and ampicillin started for dental infection. Rapid AFIB treated
pre-op with associated hypertension and angina. Discussed with
cardiology and she eventually converted to SR with beta blockade
and IV NTG (which was later d/c'ed). On [**2-22**] she was brought to
the operating room where she underwent a redo sternotomy, Aortic
Valve Replacement, and ASD closure with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1290**]. Please
see operative report for surgical details. Later on op day she
was weaned from sedation, awoke neurologically intact and
extubated. She was started beta blockers and diuretics on
post-op day one and then transferred to the floor. She was
gently diuresed towards her pre-op weight during post-op course.
Chest tubes removed without incident on post-op day two.
Epicardial pacing wires were removed on post-op day three.
Coumadin initiated with a Heparin bridge for her mechanical
valve. On post-op day five she was still in severe pain and pain
service was consulted. Also on this day her rhythm went into
Atrial Fibrillation and Amiodarone was started. At time of
discharge she was in SR with frequent PAC's with heart rate of
70. Physical therapy followed patient during entire post-op
course for strength and mobility. On post-op day six she
appeared to be doing well and was discharged to rehab with the
appropriate follow-up appointments.
