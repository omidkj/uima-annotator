History of Present Illness:
83 yo female w/ CRI, htn, h/o CHF, hypercholesterolemia, who p/w
hypoxia/respiratory failure, ARF w/ severe acidosis, transferred
from OSH for further eval. Pt originally presented to
[**Hospital 45887**] [**Hospital 107**] Hospital in [**State 3914**] on [**7-31**] w/ diarrhea &
ARF. She p/w 2 weeks of diarrhea (black stool), along w/ nausea
and decreased po intake. Saw her PCP 2 days before admission, on
[**7-29**] where per records, all labs/stool studies normal except for
elevated BUN/creatinine (118/8.4), whihc was up from her
baseline of 1.6. Her lisinopril & lasix were held, she was
encouraged to take po, and was started on cipro, with plans for
close outpt follow-up. On cipro, her stool turned yellow, but
she continued w/ profuse diarrhea "every 5 minutes" prompting
her to seek further attention 2 days later. Presented to OSH ED
on [**7-31**], where her admit labs were notable for BUN 125,
creatinine 9.7, Na 135, HCO3 13. U/A was sent which was
remarkable for mod blood, large LE, >100 WBC, [**3-28**] RBC, rare
bacteria. This later grew out 50,000 org/mL staph aereus.
Started on levoflox. Her ARF was thought to be prerenal, and she
was put on NS at 125cc/hr. Her BUN/cr slowly improved over the
next few days, to 80/5.3 on [**8-4**]. She had good uop, ~1000
mL/day, but was grossly positive for LOS, ~9 liters over 4.5
days. On [**8-3**], she had worsening pain in left foot, prompting an
xray which showed focal degenerative arthritis in the first
metatarsal phalangeal joint; she was placed on prednisone 20 qd
for gout. Also febrile to 101. Chest xray showing LLL pna, small
pleural effusion. On afternoon of [**8-4**], developed progressive
SOB. In the am, was satting 98% on RA, then dropped to 91% on RA
in the afternoon, O2 titrated up, also got ativan for anxiety.
Then got MSO4 for respiratory distress. Sats dropped to 80% on
NRBM, ABG 7.015/42/78/11, was emergently intubated ~1830, with
post intubation ABG 7/042/42/70 (on 80% FiO2). Placed on AC
550/14/5/100, with ABG improved to 7.19/41/88/16 on 100%.
Transferred to ICU, where she was diuresed with initialy lasix
80, then lasix 160, with good urine output. Given concerns for
her [**Hospital 45888**] transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.

CT ABD:
1. Allowing for absence of IV contrast enhancement, normal
appearance of the bowel without suggestion of ischemic changes.
2. Bilateral moderate sized pleural effusions with probable
associated atelectasis, although consolidation cannot be
excluded. Clinical correlation is needed.
3. Uncomplicated cholelithiasis.
4. Dilated common bile duct as noted on previous ERCP of
[**2193-2-5**].
.
TTE:
1. The left atrium is mildly dilated.
2. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and systolic
function are normal (LVEF>55%). Regional left ventricular wall
motion is normal.
3. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trace aortic
regurgitation is seen.

mitral
regurgitation is seen.

Brief Hospital Course:
.
Ms. [**Known lastname 6944**] is an 83 year-old female with history of CRI, HTN,
CHF, who presents with respiratory failure.  The following
issues were addressed during her hospital course.
.
1. RESPIRATORY FAILURE - The patient's respiratory failure was
likely multifactorial due to CHF (aggressive volume
resucitation) and pneumonia (fevers, bandemia).  Less likely
possibilities included vasculitis or pulmonary-renal syndrome
([**Doctor First Name **] and ANCA neg).   On [**8-6**] a TTE was done, which revealed
mild LA enlargement, LVEF >55%, trace AR, 1+ MR, 1+ TR, mild PA
systolic HTN.  She was initially covered with zosyn and
vancomycin to cover for possible nosocomial infection.
Eventually MRSA was cultured from her sputum.  After these
results, Zosyn was discontinued on [**8-9**] and vancomycin was
continued for 7 days.  She failed a spontaneous breathing trial
on [**8-21**], and [**8-10**].  Due to failure to wean, a tracheostomy
was performed on [**8-19**].   She was discharged to rehab after
tracheostomy.
.
2. RENAL FAILURE - She presented with acute on chronic renal
failure (baseline Cr 1.6-1.8). This was most likely secondary to
pre-renal failure, which progressed to ATN.  Urine was also
positive for urine eos; however, this is not specific.
Abdominal CT was without evidence of hydronephrosis.  Renal
followed throughout this admission, and there was no indication
for emergent hemodialysis.
.
3. C DIFF: During this admission, the patient tested postitive
for C diff, so she was started on PO flagyl.
.
4. GOUT - Patient was diagnosed with gout at an OSH and started
on prednisone.  Prednisone was held on this admission, given
concern for underlying infection.  She was started on colchicine
during this admission.
.
5. DEPRESSION - She had expressed in writing the she wanted to
kill herself.  However, given her mental status that was waxing
and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] and her difficulties with communication, it was not
felt that she was a danger to herself.  She was evaluate by
psychiatry who also cleared her.
5. FEN - On tube feeds via PEG.
