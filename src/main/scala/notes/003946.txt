Chief Complaint:
found down

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 79 yo F with history of hypertension,
hyperlipidemia, NIDDM and pituitary mass that presents having
been found down. It is unclear how long the patient was down.
She states she think that she fell after veterans day. She
thinks she fell trying to sit on her kitchen chair. She states
she has felt lightheaded for up to several months and had a cold
for the past week but otherwise she reports no specific
symptoms. She denies vertigo, chest pain, palpitations, nausea,
vomiting. Her closest contact is her [**First Name9 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name (NI) 44286**] who was the
one who called the police. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) 44286**], she has been "this
close" to her needing to be in an asissted living facility. He
hasn't been feeling well for the past year. He picks up her
medications. He last saw her a week ago and las talked to her
today when she said she was on the floor. He talked to her prior
to then several days before. Today, she seemed "groggy" to him.
He confirmed that she did not drunk. In the ED, she was
hypothermic to 94. BP was 88/45, HR 97, oxygen 98 on room air.
She was given 2L NS. She had one episode of hypotension to the
70/40 which responded to an additional 1L of NS. She was also
started on [**1-24**] NS for hypernatremia. Vitals on transfer were P
79 Bp 125/35 14 100% 2L

STUDIES:
[**2145-12-11**] CT head:
1. No evidence of acute intracranial process.
2. Small left basal ganglia lacune.
3. Age-related involution and small vessel ischemic disease.
4. Findings suspicious for pituitary adenoma with erosion of
sellar floor. Correlation with clinical history recommended. MRI
can help for further assessment as clinically indicated.
5. Complete opacification of the sphenoid sinus with extension
of disease into posterior ethmoidal air cells.

[**2145-12-11**] CT Cspine:
No acute cervical spine injury. Erosive changes are seen in
clivus. Please see head CT for further details.

[**2145-12-11**] CXR:
Possible aspiration in the bases. Large gallstone.

[**2145-12-12**] MR Pituitary:
MR EXAMINATION OF THE BRAIN AND PITUITARY GLAND WITHOUT
CONTRAST, [**2145-12-12**].

HISTORY: 79-year-old female with history of "pituitary mass"
presents with
fall; "stroke protocol" for subacute stroke and evaluate
pituitary lesion.

TECHNIQUE: Routine [**Hospital1 18**] non-enhanced MR examination of the
brain and sella
turcica was performed. N.B. Given the patient's severe renal
insufficiency
(BUN 124, creatinine 3.0 with eGFR 13 mL/min), no intravenous
gadolinium
contrast material was administered.

FINDINGS: The study is compared with the recent NECT of the head
dated
[**2145-12-11**]. As on that study, there is a markedly abnormal
appearance to the
sella turcica, which is markedly expanded with much of the
cortex of its
floor, completely eroded. The normal pituitary tissue is
replaced by an
ill-defined and somewhat heterogeneous mass, roughly
isointense-to-normal [**Doctor Last Name 352**] matter. Though its precise borders are
difficult to delineate, this process measures at least 17 (AP) x
22 (TRV) x 18 mm (CC) and likely represents a large
macroadenoma, occupying much of the sella and transgressing its
floor and possibly anterior wall. Of note, no definite posterior
pituitary "bright spot" is identified. The process within the
sella blends into the contents of the largely opacified sphenoid
sinus, which is nearly completely filled with abnormal soft
tissue material, with only its most superior-anterior portion
apparently aerated, as on the CT. The sphenoid air cells contain
foci of relative [**Name (NI) **] and more marked T2-hypointensity, with
"blooming" susceptibility artifact, which likely represent
secretions with various degrees of inspissation. The extent of
intrasphenoidal extension of the sellar mass is very difficult
to assess.

Allowing for the lack of intravenous contrast, a normal-caliber
infundibular stalk is identified, and slightly deviated to the
right with a grossly normal appearance. Though there is
effacement of the suprasellar cistern, there is no contact with
or mass effect upon the optic chiasm or the hypothalamus. Based
on the coronal T2-weighted sequence, there is no evidence of
cavernous sinus invasion, and the normal cavernous carotid
arterial flow voids are preserved.

The limited whole brain imaging is notable for moderate global
atrophy. There is relatively mild [**Name (NI) **]/FLAIR-hyperintensity,
largely limited to bifrontal periventricular white matter,
likely the sequelae of chronic small vessel ischemic disease.
There is no focus of slow diffusion to suggest an acute ischemic
event and the principal intracranial vascular flow voids,
including those of the dural venous sinuses, are preserved.
There is no evidence of intra- or extra-axial hemorrhage,
including in the sella, itself. Incidentally noted is a likely
Tornwaldt cyst in the midline nasopharynx, as well as relatively
mild chronic-appearing inflammatory changes in the maxillary
sinuses and anterior ethmoidal air cells, bilaterally, as on the
recent CT.

IMPRESSION:
1. Limited study, in the absence of intravenous contrast (which
could not be given, due to the pat
