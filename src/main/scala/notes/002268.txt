Chief Complaint:
CC:[**CC Contact Info 95464**].
Reason for MICU transfer: respiratory distress/COPD exacerbation


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 2564**] is an 83 y/o F with HTN, COPD and RA who presented
to the ED with developing LLE erythema over 3 days duration.
Presented to PCP who suggested she go to the ED for further
eval.  Denied any associated Sx including fever/chills or pain.
Does describe weeping from the lesion.  In the ED she developed
afib with RVR and was treated with IV and oral metoprolol and
admitted to medicine for further work-up of new afib.
.
On the floor, she was continued on metoprolol for afib.  She was
treated with ceftriaxone for cellulitis but blood cultures
turned positive for strep viridans.  Thus, a TTE was ordered
which showed possible aortic valve vegetation.  A TEE was
performed today to better characterize the vegetation but during
the procedure she became stridorous.
.
She was treated with nebulizers and IV steroids for presumed
COPD exacerbation.  She also had magnesium, furosemide x1, and
metoprolol IV x 2.  She was placed on a NRB with saturations in
the 90% and transfered to the MICU for further management of her
respiratory distress.

Studies:
.
[**11-30**] TTE: IMPRESSION: Aortic valve mass, probably a vegetation.
No associated aortic regurgitation. Moderate mitral and
tricuspid regurgitation
.
[**12-1**] TEE Esophagus was successfully intubated with TEE probe.
Prior to the acquisition of any pictures the patient developed
stridorous breathing which resolved fully following removal of
the TEE probe. The procedure was aborted at that time. The
patient was closely monitored in the TEE room until sedation
wore off and she fully recovered back to baseline. There was no
further stridor noted.
.
[**12-4**] CT Head: IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial process; exam
limited by exclusion of the superior-most aspect of the brain.
.
[**12-5**] CT Chest: IMPRESSION: 1. No pneumonia. 2. Mild pulmonary
edema. Moderate right and small left pleural effusions,
moderately severe bibasilar atelectasis. New moderate
cardiomegaly. 3. New severe multilevel thoracic vertebral
compression fractures.
.
[**12-9**] CXR: PFI: Improved appearance of right lung with residual
right cardiophrenic consolidation with trace right pleural
effusion; unchanged retrocardiac consolidation with small left
pleural effusion.


Brief Hospital Course:
Assessment and Plan: Ms. [**Known lastname 2564**] is an 83 y/o F with HTN, COPD
and RA who presented with cellulitis and afib with RVR in the
ED. Found to be bacteremic on the floor and found to have aortic
valve vegitation.
.
# Strep viridans bacteremia - The patient initially presented
with cellulitis of her left leg and was treated with oral
antibiotics. On Day #3 of therapy, [**12-29**] blood cultures drawn at
admission returned (+) for Strep Viridans. She was started on IV
ceftriaxone on [**2134-11-29**]. The patient underwent TTE which
revealed an aoritc valve vegitation. Plan was for TEE however,
during the procedure, the patient became stridorous (as
described in detail below) and required intubation and MICU
transfer. In the MICU, the patient underwent TEE which again
demonstrated the aortic valve vegitation. On [**2134-12-8**], the
patient was HD stable and was able to return to the medicine
floor from the MICU. A midline was placed for long term
antibiotic therapy. The patient will be discharged to a rehab
center where she will continue antibiotic therapy for 1 month
and follow-up with ID as an outpatient.
.
# Respiratory distress:  On [**2134-12-1**] a TEE was attempted
however had to be abandoned as the patient became stridorous
during the procedure. Following this event, the patient was
stable on the floor until ~6pm when she began to develop
respiratory distress. Despite agressive measures including IV
steroids, nebs, O2, lasix, and racemic epi the patient required
intubation and was transferred to the MICU. In the MICU the
patient was diuresed further and continued on
albuterol/ipratropium for COPD. Was also started on methylpred
60 mg q8h. Imaging showed a mild left effusion and atelectasis.
Extubated on MICU day #1 without event. During her ICU course,
the patient would intermittently develop respiratory distress
and stridor, with saturations dipping into the low 80s. She
underwent BiPAP intermittently overnight, then was changed to
nasal BiPAP after her respiratory status improved. On the floor,
the patient self-discontinued BiPAP due to discomfort. Seen by
ENT who scoped to the level of the vocal cords but found no
abnormality. Etiology of respiratory decompensation is unclear
although is believed to be related to possible upper airway
edema exacerbated by TEE/intubation. Also has poor reserve with
underlying COPD and severe kyphosis.
.
# Afib with RVR - The patient was noted to be in afib with RVR
while in the ED. No known h/o afib. In the hospital she was
initially controlled with IV metoprolol and loaded with orals.
Oral metoprolol titrated to 200mg daily and converted to long
acting. Given CHADS2 score of 2, anti-coagulation was
recommended and the patient was agreeable. Started on warfarin
without bridge and will continue warfarin on an outpatient
basis. Goal INR [**1-28**].
.
# Osteoporosis - In house, the patient was incidentally found to
have a number of new compression fractures on imaging. Is
writted for alendronate, vitamin D, and calcium at home although
reports not reliably taking the alendronate. She was maintained
on calcium and vitamin D in house. Received Alendronate on
Mondays per home schedule. She never complained of pain related
to compression fractures.
.
# COPD - The patient carrie
