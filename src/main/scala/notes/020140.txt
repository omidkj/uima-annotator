CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Abdominal pain with fever, chills.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 40 year old
male with a past medical history significant for HIV
(diagnosed in [**2131**], with CD4 count 550 in [**11-16**], viral load
less than 50), depression, and polysubstance abuse, who
presented to the Emergency Department with complaints of
abdominal pain associated with fevers and chills as well as
transient chest pain following recreational drug use.  The
patient presented to the Emergency Department following
several day history of recreational drug use including
methamphetamine, GHB, and Viagra with complaint of transient
episode of substernal chest pain.  The patient's chest pain
resolved by arrival to the Emergency Department.

However, on review of systems, the patient reports a several
day history of crampy abdominal pain associated with
intermittent fever and chills.  The patient denied diarrhea,
nausea, vomiting, as well as intolerance of oral intake. The
patient reported recent use of substances including Viagra,
GHB and methamphetamine for purposes of sexual enhancement.
The patient does report prolonged history of depressed mood
with recent worsening, however, denied current intoxication
as a suicide attempt and/or gesture.  The patient is
currently being treated for depression with medication as
well as counselling therapy.  He denies prior suicide
attempts.

On arrival to the Emergency Department, the patient was found
afebrile and hemodynamically stable.  However, shortly after
presentation, the patient clinically deteriorated with
spiking temperatures to 104.0 F. associated with myoclonic
movement and decreased mental status.  The patient received 6
mg of intravenous Ativan for myoclonus and subsequently was
noted with symptomatic hypotension with systolic blood
pressures in the 80s, heart rate in the 140s.   The patient
was subsequently intubated for airway protection.  The
patient's acute change in mental status with clinical
deterioration was worked up in the Emergency Department with
radiologic studies including a negative head CAT scan, normal
chest x-ray, and abdominal CAT scan notable for diffuse
colonic wall thickening (right greater than left).

The patient's serum toxin screen was notable for
amphetamines.  The patient's initial blood work was notable
for a white blood cell count of 15.8, total bilirubin of 3.6
with mildly elevated transaminases, a CPK of greater than
3,000, and an anion gap of 17.  The patient underwent a
lumbar puncture with evidence of benign CSF fluid.  The
patient received a total of 6 liters of intravenous fluids
(no pressors) while in the Emergency Department and was
started on broad spectrum antibiotics including Vancomycin,
Ceftriaxone, Acyclovir, and Flagyl.  The patient was
subsequently transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit
for further evaluation.
