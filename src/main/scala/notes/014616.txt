History of Present Illness:
78 yo woman presented with abdominal pain since for 12 hours.
Patient has had a recent history of abdominal pain and extensive
workup by gastroenterology.  Was recently hospitalized and
discharged ([**3-2**]- [**3-4**]) for same type of pain, however, the most
recent pain is far more intense and has been unremitting since
it began. On her previous admission she had an EGD which showed
gastritis and a CT scan that showed complete atherosclerotic
occlusion of the celiac axis with retrograde flow, and severe
SMA narrowing.  However there has never been any  evidence of
acute ischemia of the bowel on imaging or exam.

In the ED she was in distress, at times bundled over with RUQ
pain.  This newest RUQ pain is distinct form the pain that
brought her into the ED, which had been described as upper
abdominal, and bandlike in nature.  She is afebrile.  No
extremity pain or limited motion.  No vision changes, headaches
or symptoms of ischemia elsewhere.  Bowel movements have been
loose for several weeks.  Patietn has been urinating, but has a
diaper as she is incontinent.

The patient reports a 5 month history of vague abdominal
discomfort, nausea, nonbloody diarrhea, and occasional vomiting.
She reports anorexia and a 30lb weight loss since [**Month (only) 216**]. She
also has significant weakness and lethargy.

Brief Hospital Course:
# On arrival on [**3-6**] a CT scan showed no evidence of bowel
ischemia, persistently mildly dilated gallbladder, and severe
mesenteric atherosclerotic disease. Given that it was known that
she had occlusion of her celiac artery with severe stenosis of
superior mesenteric artery, and no other explanation for her
abdominal pain patient underwent an uncomplicated superior
mesenteric artery stent on day of arrival. Postoperatively she
had persistent right upper quadrant pain. She remained alert and
oriented and afebrile. A follow-up CT scan was completed on
[**3-8**]. The CT showed marked distention and mural thickening of
the gallbladder with free fluid in the pericholecystic area. The
findings were consistent with acute cholecystitis, with probable
areas of mural necrosis and perforation. The patient underwent
percutaneous cholecystectomy by interventional radiology for
drainage of pericolic fluid in the setting of gallbladder
perforation secondary to acute acalculous cholecystitis. After
the drain was placed she was transferred to the medicine service
for further management on [**3-9**]. The drain continued to drain
non-purulent bilious material. She remained afebrile. Her diet
was advanced and on day of discharge she tolerated a regular
diet without nausea or vomiting. She had mild, intermittent
right upper quadrant abdominal pain, which responded to PO pain
meds.
It is unclear whether the etiology of her abdominal pain on
initial presentation was secondary to the mesenteric ischemia,
cholecystitis or both. Of note, her gastrin was 300 on a prior
admission. If she continues to have gastritis-like abdominal
pain we recommend an outpatient work up for Zollinger [**Doctor Last Name 9480**]
syndrome.
.
# Cholecystitis:  The percutaneous cholecystostomy tube remained
in place. It continued to drain 200-300 cc's of bilious
non-purulent drainage. She was initially started on IV Flagyl
and Cipro. The final cultures were positive for klebsiella which
was sensitive to Cipro and Flagyl and she was transitioned to
oral Cipro and Flagyl. The infectious disease consultants
recommended a 14 day course of PO Cipro/Flagyl which began on
[**3-12**] and will end on [**3-25**] unless the perc-chole tube
is still in place. She should be continued on these antibiotics
as long as the perc-chol tube is in place. On day of discharge
she was tolerating a regular diet without pain and she was
afebrile.
.
#Pleuritic pain: Throughout the hospital course she had some
mild bilateral pain which she described as "rib" pain. It
improved throughout her hospitalization. It was likely MSK in
the setting of chronic cough- worse with movement and better
with heat and Tylenol. No PNA on was seen on repeated CXRs.
.
# Leukocytosis:  Acute on subacute/chronic leukocytosis. Her
baseline WBC has been 17-19. In the setting of this
hospitalization it trended up and nadired at 47.6. on day of
discharge it was 20. She has been seen by outpatient oncology
regarding her baseline leukocytosis which may be related to a
malignancy and will get a bone marrow biopsy as an outpatient.
RUQ u/s negative for abscess on day prior to discharge. U/A neg.
CXR with b/l effusions but no consolidation. BCX negative. c
diff negative x 3. HIV negative
- Hep serologies pending, quantaferon gold pending on day of
discharge
.
# Mild hypoxia: She has known COPD and decompensated from a
pulmonary standpoint post-operatively. She required oxygen by
nasal canula for comfort and to maintain oxygenation. Her oxygen
requirement improved each day. By day of discharge her Oxygen
saturations were 90%-92% on RA and 95% on 2LNC. Steroids were
not given because of her biliary infection but she was given
Albuterol Inhaler as needed and Ipratropium Bromide MDI three
times daily. She was discharged on Fluticasone-Salmeterol
Diskus. In addition to COPD post-operative atelectasis as seen
on CXR and left lower lobe collapse (which was documented to
improve on repeat CXRs) were likely contributing.
.
# Severe peripheral vascular disease s/p bypass grafts: She was
continued on Plavix which she will take for life. She was
continued on Aspirin 81 mg each day.
.
# Graves' disease/ apathetic thyrotoxicosis
