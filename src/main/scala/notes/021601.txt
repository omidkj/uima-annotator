Service: NEUROLOGY

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5018**]
Chief Complaint:
Left Facial Droop and Left Hemiparesis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
* Cardiac Catheterization with stent placement
* Administration of IV t-PA

History of Present Illness:
PER ADMITTING FELLOW:
Patient is 65M with multiple vascular risk factors, including
CAD
with multiple prior stents.  He had been experiencing chest
tightness with exertion and SOB x 2 weeks.  Today, he had a
cardiac catheterization with stent placement in the LAD; the
sheath was removed at 9:30pm.

At 1:30am, the patient was observed by his RN to actively
develop
L facial droop.  The patient's primary team was contact[**Name (NI) **] and
found L hemiparesis on exam.  Code Stroke was activated at
2:31am.

Initial NIHSS = 7 at 2:45am.
LOC ?????? 0
Questions ?????? 0
Commands ?????? 0
Gaze ?????? 0
Visual ?????? 0
Face ?????? 2 (L facial weakness)
Motor ?????? 2 (L arm drift and L leg drift)
Ataxia ?????? 0
Sensory ?????? 2 (Cannot feel pinpirick on L)
Language ?????? 0
Dysarthria ?????? 0
Extinction ?????? 1 (L extinction to DSS)

Repeat NIHSS performed by the stroke fellow at 4am was identical
to the above except for L facial weakness ranked as ??????1.??????  Head
imaging and labs are as noted below.

Risks and benefits of IVTPA were discussed with the patient.  He
has no absolute contraindications to IV TPA, but risks are above
average given recent cardiac catheterization, slightly elevated
PTT, and hyperglycemia.

The patient agreed to proceed with IVTPA.  He was transferred to
the Neuro ICU and a bolus of 10mg was administered.  The
remaining 80mg was infused over the subsequent 60 minutes, for a
total of 90mg.

ROS:
-Patient denies the following: prior stroke, prior intracranial
hemorrhage or aneurysm, intraocular bleed, surgery (other than
this cath) within 2 weeks, GI bleed.
-Patient initially mentioned that he developed a headache around
the same time that he developed chest pain at 1:30am today.  On
further questioning, he mentioned that he has had a headache the
entire day, which he attributes to lack of sleep.

IMAGING:
.
CTA, P Head and Neck ([**2126-10-25**]):
IMPRESSION:
1. Findings likely representing changes of chronic microvascular
infarction
in white matter, without CT evidence for acute territorial
infarction; the
CT-perfusion study is unremarkable.
2. Moderate stenoses of the proximal left subclavian and
vertebral arteries,
with otherwise mild-to-moderate atherosclerotic disease
throughout the neck,
and no flow-limiting intracranial lesions.
3. Extensive multilevel degenerative changes of the cervical
spine.
4. Moderate transverse narrowing of the mid-cervical trachea at
the level of
the thyroid gland, of unclear etiology, which should be
correlated with
patient's clinical history.
.
MRI Brain ([**2126-10-26**]):
IMPRESSION: Limited study with only sagittal T1 images obtained.
No mass
effect or herniation seen.
.
CT Head Without Contrast ([**2126-10-26**]):
IMPRESSION: No definite evidence for acute territorial
infarction.
.
Transthoracic Echocardiogram ([**2126-10-25**]):
The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial septal defect or
patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline
contrast with maneuvers. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion
abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF 60%). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The ascending
aorta is mildly dilated. There are focal calcifications in the
aortic arch. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened
but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is
no mitral valve prolapse. There is no pericardial effusion.
.
Cardiac Catheterization ([**2126-10-24**]):
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Two vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Successful PTCA of the ostial and mid D1.
3. Successful direct stenting of the mid LAD.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 10083**] is a 65 year-old right handed man with a past
medical history including hypertension, hyperlipidemia, DM, and
CAD s/p stenting who was transferred from Good Samaritin to the
[**Hospital1 18**] for a planned endovascular procedure.  He developed a new
left facial droop and left-hemiparesis within hours of the
procedure [**2126-10-24**], and was transferred to the Neurology Stroke
Service on [**2126-10-25**].  He remained on the stroke service until
his discharge on [**2126-10-27**].
.
In the setting of the recent stent placement, the potential
etiologies for the new neurological symptoms were thought to
include cerebral embolism and intracranial hemorrhage, possibly
related to intra-procedure heparin use.  However, a stat
non-contrast CT of the head showed no evidence of bleeding,
remote infarction, or early signs of ischemia.  While the large
vessels appeared patent on a CT angiogram, the study was notable
for signs of decreased filling of the cortical branches of the
right middle cerebral artery (MCA).    Similarly, the Mean
Transit Time was prolonged in the right MCA relative to the
left.  Collectively, the findings supported the presence of
ongoing ischemia in the right MCA territory with potential
embolization into distal branches of the MCA.
.
Given the neuro-imaging data and the patient's NIHSS of seven,
IV t-PA was considered a therapeutic option.  After carefully
discussing the pote
