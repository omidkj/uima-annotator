Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7333**]
Chief Complaint:
Seizure activity/NSVT

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Pacemaker placment


History of Present Illness:
79 year old female with severe AS (valve area 0.8, peak gradient
75), afib on coumadin, dCHF (EF 60%), sinus bradycardia
(recently taken off of metoprolol), and hypertension who
presents from [**Hospital 100**] rehab for evaluation of seizure-like
activity. Per review of facility records, on [**5-7**] 7:45pm noted
to have "upper extremity tremors, eyes rolled back of head...
very confused and disoriented." At 9:30pm she was reported to
have a similar episode although a record of this event is not
available. Patient was free of headache, chest pain, shortness
of breath, tongue-biting.
.
Of note the patient was recently admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] [**Location (un) 620**] from
[**Date range (1) 82333**] with CHF, L femur fracture following reported
mechanical fall. She underwent ORIF on [**5-2**] by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
During the admission she was noted to be bradycardic (HR 40s)
with suspected junctional beats and per cardiology her
metoprolol was discontinued. Her HR remained 50-70. She also
presented with ARF with Cr 1.5, on discharge creatinine was 1.4.
Her INR was reversed for surgery and she was discharged to rehab
on coumadin with Lovenox bridge.
.
In the emergency department, initial vitals: T100-101.6, 140/80,
60, 20, 89 on RA, on 95% on 2L. No seizure activity of confusion
observed in ED (family at bedside and states patient at
baseline). Patient had been bradycardic in 50s maintaining BP.
At 11pm, patient was noted to have polymorphic NSVT ([**11-20**]
beats, x3 episodes) with torsades morphology. Labs were notable
for WBC 12.7 with 90.9% polys, negative CE, INR 2.8, lactate
2.3. UA was positive and she was given a dose of Cipro 400mg IV
at midnight for UTI. She was also given IVF - NS 800cc. CXR and
CT head were normal with no change from previous.
.
For NSVT, given bolus and gtt of lidocaine. Given 4mg IV mag for
mag of 1.9. Patient was evaluated by cardiology fellow and
decision was made to admit to CCU. On transfer from ED, vitals
were T98.6, HR50, BP150/38, RR16, 96% on 2L.
.
On arrival to the CCU, patient denies chest pain, palpitations.
She does not remember seizure-like activity. She reports
persistent dry cough. She denies dyspnea, abdominal pain,
diarrhea, dysuria, focal weakness or numbness.

Physical Exam:
Vitals: 98.9; HR 75; BP 155/38; 18 96%RA
GENERAL: Pleasant, fatigued appearing elderly woman in no
distress.
HEENT: Normocephalic. No scleral icterus. PERRL (although
constricted). Dry mucous membranes. Neck supple. No appreciable
JVD. Skin tear left cheek.
SKIN: Multiple eccymoses upper extremitites; dry, scaly,
hyperpigmented skin at dorsal surface of both hands
CHEST: dressing C/I/D
CARDIAC: Regular rhythm, normal rate. S1, S2. 3/6 SEM best
appreciated at LUSB, heard throughout, radiating to the carotids

LUNGS: CTA bilaterally; no wheezes, rales, or rhonchi
ABDOMEN: NABS. Soft, NT, ND.
EXTREMITIES: No edema or calf pain, good perfusion, 2+ radial,
dorsalis pedis, posterior tibial pulses
NEURO: A&Ox2. (oriented to person/place, but not time) CNII-XII
intact EXCEPT for right upward gaze palsy; upper and RLE
extremity strength 5/5 (unable to assess LLE strength 2/2 recent
surgery)

Pertinent Results:
CT head without contrast ([**2113-5-7**]):
IMPRESSION: No intracranial hemorrhage or edema.

CXR 2V ([**2113-5-7**]):
IMPRESSION: Cardiomegaly without acute cardiopulmonary process.

ECHO:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. No left atrial mass/thrombus
seen (best excluded by transesophageal echocardiography). The
estimated right atrial pressure is 10-20mmHg. Left ventricular
wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic
function are normal (LVEF >55%). The right ventricular cavity is
moderately dilated with moderate global free wall hypokinesis.
The aortic valve leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. There
is severe aortic valve stenosis (valve area 0.8-1.0cm2). No
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Mild to moderate ([**12-9**]+) mitral regurgitation
is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral
regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.] The
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate to
severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is severe
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
effusion.

IMPRESSION: Severe aortic valve stenosis. Severe pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. Right ventricular cavity
enlargement with free wall hypokinesis. At least mild-moderate
mitral regurgitation. Normal left ventricular cavity size and
regional/global systolic function.

Carodtid U/S
IMPRESSION:
1. 80-99% stenosis in the right internal carotid artery with the
degree of
stenosis being more likely 80% than 99%.
2. 60-69% stenosis in the left internal carotid artery.

[**5-11**] Cath
COMMENTS:
1. Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system
revealed
no obstructive, flow-limiting disease.  The LMCA, LAD, LCx, and
RCA were
all widely patent.
2. There was moderate arterial systolic hypertension with a
central
aortic SBP of 162mmHg.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Coronary arteries are free of angiographically significant
disease.

CXR: [**5-13**]
Compared to the prior study, there is no significant interval
change in the pacemaker leads, the heart is mildly increased in
size, there is pulmonary vascular redistribution and patchy
areas of volume loss/infiltrate in both
lower lungs. There is no pneumothorax.
