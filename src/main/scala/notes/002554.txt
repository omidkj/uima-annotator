Pertinent Results:

CXR [**2103-10-13**]
AP UPRIGHT PORTABLE CHEST X-RAY: The study is limited secondary
to patient's positioning. The right costophrenic angle is not
seen. The cardiac silhouette is normal in size. The aorta is
tortuous. There is stable overinflation of bilateral lung
fields, with flattening of the cardiac silhouette, and bilateral
hemidiaphragms. Hyperlucency bilaterally and symmetrically is
consistent with diffuse emphysema. The imaged lung fields are
otherwise clear, with slight stable scarring at the left lung
base. There is no pneumothorax, and the pulmonary vasculature is
normal.
IMPRESSION:
1. No acute cardiopulmonary process.
2. Underlying diffuse bilateral emphysema.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 64 yo male with HTN, severe COPD with FEV1 20%, on home
oxygen 4L and chronic steroids, with multiple prior intubations,
admitted with COPD flare and hypotension.
.
1) Shortness of breath:  The patient's presentation was
consistent with a COPD flare.  There was no new infiltrate on
Chest X-ray, and there was no change in the
consistency/amount/frequency of his sputum production.
Pulmonary embolism is highly unlikely.  It was felt there was no
indication for antibiotics.  We continued his steroids at
prednisone 60mg po qd, and discharged the patient on a taper
over 10 days.  We continued albuterol and ipratropium bromide
nebulizer treatments, scheduled.  The pt was started on
fluticasone and salmeterol inhalers, and he will use these as an
outpatient.  He did not have to go on Bipap.  At discharge, he
was able to walk around the ICU five times.  He reports this is
his baseline.  He will follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 575**], his
pulmonologist in the next 2 weeks.
.
2) [**Name (NI) **] The pt had one episode of SBP in the 90s in the
ED.  He was asymptomatic.  We considered a normal variation in
BP, and could not r/o mild volume depletion given insensible
losses vs adrenal insufficiency as pt is on steroid taper.
We recommend cortstim on the pt as an outpatient.  We continued
steroids for COPD flare.  Our goal was for MAP<60 and
UOP<30cc/hour, supported with fluid boluses if need be, however
he did not require this.  He was with stable VS throughout his
[**Hospital Unit Name 153**] stay.  No more episodes of hypotension.  He was placed on
his high blood pressure medications while in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].
.
3) [**Name (NI) 20182**] The pt's urine cultures came back positive for
>3 colony types, consistent with fecal contamination.  Urology
felt that this was likely colonization, given he has a chronic
indwelling catheter.  The catheter was changed on [**2103-10-15**], and
urology recommended Macrodantin for 3 day course given the cath
change.  The pt is to follow up with Dr.[**Name (NI) 20183**] at [**Hospital1 112**] for
potential transurethral needle ablation of the prostate for
benign prostatic hyperplasia.
.
4) [**Name (NI) 3674**] Pt has history of anemia in past, unclear when his
last colonoscopy was.  Will have pt follow up with PCP as
outpatient to schedule colonoscopy.  Stools were guiaic
negative.
.
5) Coronary Artery Disease- No current evidence of angina.  We
continued his ACE inhibitor/[**Name (NI) **]/statin.
.
6) Code status-  FULL.
