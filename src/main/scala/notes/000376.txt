Pertinent Results:
[**2171-8-12**] Intraop [**Month/Day/Year **]
PREBYPASS
The left atrium is elongated. No spontaneous echo contrast is
seen in the body of the left atrium or left atrial appendage.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is mildly depressed however given degree of MR
LV intrinsic function may be worse. (LVEF= 50%). Right
ventricular chamber size is normal with normal free wall
contractility. The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus
level. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal
with good leaflet excursion. No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is partial
posterior mitral leaflet flail likely at the junction of P1 and
P2. Torn mitral chordae are present. Moderate to Severe (3+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial effusion.

POSTBYPASS
LV systolic function now appears normal. RV systolic function
remains normal. There is a ring prosthesis in the mitral
position. No MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 48613**]. There is no mitral stenosis.
However [**Male First Name (un) **] of the MV leaflets is present. The [**Male First Name (un) **] is mild
however changes (worsens or improves SBP <90 vs SBP >130
respectively) depending on loading conditions. MR appears when
[**Male First Name (un) **] becomes significant. The remaining study is otherwise
unchanged from prebypass.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the hospital and brought to the
operating room on [**2171-8-12**] where the patient underwent mitral
valve repair with resection of
the middle scallop of the posterior leaflet and a mitral valve
annuloplasty with a 30-mm Future CG annuloplasty ring. Overall
the patient tolerated the procedure well and post-operatively
was transferred to the CVICU in stable condition for recovery
and invasive monitoring. POD 1 found the patient extubated,
alert and oriented and breathing comfortably.  The patient was
neurologically intact and hemodynamically stable on no inotropic
or vasopressor support.  Beta blocker was initiated.  No
diuresis was initiated due to [**Male First Name (un) **] seen on intraop
echocardiogram.  Echo was repeated to further evaluate this on
the day of discharge and the report was pending.  The patient
was transferred to the telemetry floor for further recovery.
Chest tubes and pacing wires were discontinued without
complication.  The patient was evaluated by the physical therapy
service for assistance with strength and mobility.  By the time
of discharge on POD 4 the patient was ambulating freely, the
wound was healing and pain was controlled with oral analgesics.
The patient was discharged home in good condition with VNA
services and appropriate follow up instructions.
