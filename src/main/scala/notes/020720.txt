Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 297**]
Chief Complaint:
urosepsis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
This is a 75yo F from [**Doctor First Name 391**] Bay with h/o AAA s/p repair c/b
spinal shock with resulting parplegia presents with lethargy and
nausea x 2 days. She was in her usual state of health until
baclofen to 30 [**Hospital1 **]. She subsequnetly became lethargic and NH
decreased baclofen to 15 on [**6-5**]. Her lethargy did not improve.
On [**6-7**] UA positive for gram negative organism. SHe was started
on levofloxacin. Her lethargy persisted and on [**6-8**], she was
minimally responsive and hence was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]. In ED,
patient was stuporous and dropped her blood pressure to 80s.

Her initial vitals are T99.2 P68 BP 97/47 R 20 98%RA. She
recieved one dose of vancomycin at 1100. Sepsis protocol was
initiated and got 6L NS so far. She is at baseline A+O x3.
According to family, she fell out of bed. The patient is at
baseline wheelchair bound and continued to have significant
bilateral lower extremity spasticity


Past Medical History:

paraplegia (spinal infarct)
history of Afib on coumadin and amiodarone
stage 3 decubitus ulcer at coccyx
CVA-embolic to MCA


Social History:
does not smoke/no alcohol

Family History:
noncontributory

Physical Exam:
Gen-somnolent, mumbling, disoriented
HEENT-anicteric, neck supple, oral mucosa dry
CV-rrr, no r/m/g
resp-CTAB
[**Last Name (un) 103**]-soft, NT/ND, ?right CVA tenderness
ext-lower extremity contracted, no edema


Pertinent Results:
CT head
1) Large chronic infarct involving the right posterior cerebral
artery territory. Chronic lacunar infarct in the left caudate
nucleus.
2) Small lacunar infarct involving the right thalamus of unknown
age.  Questionable area of low density seen in the left
thalamus. An acute infarction cannot be entirely excluded, if
clinically indicated, MRI is more sensitive to determine an
acute infarction

echo:
EF 45%
Conclusions:
The left atrium is mildly elongated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses and  cavity size are normal. There is mild global
left ventricular hypokinesis  without regionality. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are  normal. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis  is not present. Trace aortic regurgitation may be
present. The mitral valve  appears structurally normal with
trivial mitral regurgitation. There is  moderate pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
75yo F with likely Ecoli sepsis and UTI enrolled [**Doctor Last Name **] MUST
protocol.

Patient was initially septic with fever, lactate 5.5 and 9% band
and hypotensive requiring levophed. Sepsis protocol was
initiated. Her blood pressure became stable with aggressive
fluid resuscitation and she was off levophed on the same day.
Blood culture grew [**2-27**] gram Ecoli(resistant to quinolones)and
[**1-27**] GPC(likely contaminant); urine culture + proteus(resistant
to quinolones and bactrim). Her white blood cell was decreasing,
lactate decreasing, blood pressure stable off levophed.
Surveillance blood culture was negative so far. She was
initially continued on zosyn.

She also had acute renal failure with creatinine peaked at 3.6.
That resolved quickly with aggressive fluid resuscitation and
was eventually down to 1.1. CT abdomen showed nonobstructive
stone in proximal right ureter and no hydronephrosis

Due to the fluid resusciation, she went into rapid atrial
fibrillation and developed flash pulmonary edema. Lasix,
metoprolol to control her heart rate helped her. Echocardiogram
was done and it showed EF of 45%. Cardiac enzymes were
unremarkable. She was restarted on amiodarone 200 QD. Her
coumadin for AF was held due to high INR.

Her mental status improved and she communicated with her family
that this is not the quality of life that she wanted. Her
quality of life had been on the downslop ever since her AAA
repair followed by paraplegia. After extensive family meeting
and also with the patient, it was clear that she is very unhappy
with her current quality of life and she would only want comfort
measure. she was only on medication to keep her comfortable and
all other medication has been discontinued.

SHe will be discharged back to her nursing home and continue
comfort measure
