History of Present Illness:
80 yo male with history of Parkinson's disease, dementia, CAD,
and CHF with EF 25% who presented for altered mental status.  He
was last at his baseline yesterday at 10am.  Last night, his
careworkers reported that he was refusing medications and
hallucinating.  Over the past few days he has had his eyes
closed more and has had a decreased appetite.  Last night, he
was diaphoretic and uncovering himself in bed.  He was very
restless and pointing to his abdomen.  This morning, patient
remained altered and had one episode of emesis.  His finger
sticks were also higher than they were normall, elevated at 280
from 100.  At baseline, pt speaks few words in Greek and is
bed-bound, but is responsive and recognizes familiar faces.

In the ED, initial vitals were: HR85, BP 132/89, RR 16, 02 97%
RA, rectal temp 101.2.  He was responsive only to pain.
-UA was grossly positive
-He was given ceftriaxone
-He was tachy with abd pain? CT abdomen performed and revealed
8-mm obstructing right mid ureteric stone with upstream
hydronephroureter.
-Urology deferred to IR
-IR to put in perc neph tube tonight
-Initial lactate 4.1 w/ markedly abnl UA suggestive of
infection. Pt received rectal tylenol, 2L NS. Pt also given
Zofran for nausea after several episodes of gagging.
-CXR nonacute. CT head negative for intracranial hemorrhage.
-access 2PIV
Most recent vitals prior to transfer:

He went to IR for perc neph tube placement where he was on
pressors during the procedure.  An 8F catheter was placed on the
right side draining to vac.

On arrival to the MICU, he will not respond to voice or noxious
stimuli.  Family reports this is at his baseline at times.

Imaging:
# CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2141-6-25**]
FINDINGS:  Single AP upright radiograph of the chest was
obtained.  The lungs are slightly lower in volume but clear.
There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Heart is top
normal in size with normal cardiomediastinal contours.

# CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2141-6-25**]
FINDINGS:  There is no intracranial hemorrhage, mass effect,
edema, or shift of normally midline structures.  The [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white
matter differentiation is preserved.  There is extensive
periventricular and subcortical white matter hypoattenuation,
compatible with a small vessel ischemic disease.  Ventricles and
sulci are prominent, compatible with age-related involution.
Suprasellar and basilar cisterns are patent.

Paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are well aerated.
Vascular
calcifications are seen in the cavernous carotid arteries.  The
middle ear structures are symmetric.  Soft tissue density in
bilateral external auditory canals likely represents cerumen.
Globes are intact with bilateral lens replacement.

IMPRESSION:
1.  No acute intracranial process.
2.  Extensive age-related involution and small vessel ischemic
disease.
3.  If there is persistent clinical concern for ischemia,
consider MRI if not contraindicated.

# CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST Study Date of [**2141-6-25**]
CT ABDOMEN:  There is trace bibasilar dependent atelectasis.
The heart is normal in size without pericardial effusion.
Multivessel coronary arterial calcifications are noted, with
concurrent aortic valve calcification.

The liver demonstrates no focal lesion.  The gallbladder,
spleen, and adrenal glands appear unremarkable.  The pancreas is
diffusely atrophic and demonstrates a 9-mm cyst in the head.
There is no pan
