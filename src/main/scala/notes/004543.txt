CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Bright red blood per rectum.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 85 year-old lady with
a history of dementia, pacemaker, hypertension and a history
of bright red blood per rectum who presents with bright red
blood per rectum.  She is currently on aspirin and Vioxx and
she lives in an [**Hospital3 **] center and was found to have
bright red blood per rectum that persisted despite wiping at
7:00 in the morning on [**2188-4-28**].  In the Emergency
Department she passed a total of 1 liter of bright red blood
per rectum and was given intravenous Protonix and normal
saline times 2 liters.  She was seen by GI who recommended
nasogastric lavage, but the patient's daughter declined any
interventions such as no nasogastric tube and no colonoscopy.
The patient is DNR/DNI and the patient's daughter did not
want any invasive procedures.  She was admitted to the
Intensive Care Unit and the FI CU. Her blood pressure and
hematocrit remained stable.  She received 4 units of packed
red blood cells.  She had no further episodes of rebleeding
while in the Intensive Care Unit.  Incidentally she was noted
to have a creatinine bump of 1.2 to 1.7 with a potassium of
6.0 while in the FI CU.  She was given Kayexalate, calcium
gluconate and insulin plus D50 and her potassium corrected.
Additionally, the patient severely sundowned while in the FI
CU, but responded well to Zyprexa.  Currently the patient's
daughter would like her to go back to [**Hospital3 **] as soon
as possible.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Dementia.

DDD pacer for sick sinus syndrome.

Bright red blood per rectum in [**2187-5-29**] seen in the
Emergency Department with a stable hematocrit and sent home.

Depression.

Hypertension.

History of high hematocrits, which is to her knowledge never
worked up.  Could have potentially polycythemia [**Doctor First Name **].

Status post recent admission for right hip pain.  Received a

treated with APAP/Celebrex.

She also had a urinary tract infection at this time treated
with Levofloxacin.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  She lives in an [**Hospital3 **] center.  She
walks with a walker.  No alcohol or tobacco.  She is DNR/DNI.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature maximum was 98.0.
temperature current 96.8 axillary.  Heart rate was ranging
from 60s to 70s.  Her blood pressure was 176/73.  It had been
90 while on the floor just prior to being transferred to the
FI CU.  She is [**Age over 90 **] percent on room air breathing 17 breaths a
minute.  General, she is sleepy status post intravenous
Haldol given for sundowning in the FI CU.  She was not quite
verbally responsive at that time, however, later was verbal
and talkative and alert.  HEENT she has dry mucous membranes.
Pupils are equal, round and reactive to light.  Anicteric
sclera.  Neck no lymphadenopathy.  No elevated JVP
appreciated.  Chest she had some rales at the right base.
Cardiovascular regular rate and rhythm with a 3 out of 6
systolic murmur at the apex.  Belly is soft, nontender and
nondistended.  Positive bowel sounds.  Rectal examination
brown stool, positive external hemorrhoids and guaiac
positive.  No bright red blood per rectum at this time.
Extremities no lower extremity edema.  She had bruises on her
lower extremities.  Neurological examination alert and
oriented to self.  Upon later examination.  Appears to have a
mild left face droop, which the daughter states is old and
she is moving all of her extremities.

LABORATORIES ON ADMISSION:  Hematocrit was 54 upon admission,
nadired down to 44.  She also developed a leukocytosis
peaking at 16.6, with 87 percent neutrophils and no bands, 7
percent lymphocytes.  Platelets are within normal limits.
Coags were within normal limits.  Urinalysis no signs of
infection.  Chemistries were essentially within normal limits
with the exception of a rise in creatinine to 1.7 upon
admission, but decreased to normal and a potassium of 6.0,
which subsequently decreased to normal after treatment.
Urine culture shows no growth times two.  She is H pylori
antibody negative.  She had a chest x-ray, which showed an
infiltration in the right lower lobe and compression of the
left lower lobe.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. Lower gastrointestinal bleed:  She is status post four
   units of packed red blood cells.  Her hematocrit never
   dropped below 44, however, she has an elevated hematocrit
   at baseline.  She did have a 10 point hematocrit drop.
   Her blood pressure was stable in the Emergency Department,
   but then dropped to the 90s while she was on the floor and
   that led to her transfer to the FI CU.  Once on the FI CU
   she was stable. Her blood pressure became hypertensive to
   the 70s to 190s and her antihypertensives were restarted.
   She remained hemodynamically stable while transferred to
   the floor.  The etiology of this bleed has not been
   determined given that the daughter's wishes to not have
   any invasive measures such as colonoscopy or nasogastric
   tube.  She has a questionable history of diverticula,
   although cannot rule out AVM or cancer.  She had no
   rebleeding after her bleed in the Emergency Department.
   She was maintained with two large bore intravenouses,
   proton pump inhibitor b.i.d. intravenously and then
   transitioned to po once a day.  Her aspirin and Vioxx were
   held.

1. Community acquired pneumonia:  Given her leukocytosis and
   right lower lobe infiltrates on chest x-ray treatment with
   Levofloxacin was begun and she should continue for seven
   days.  It was started on [**4-30**].

1. Fungal groin rash treated with nystatin.

1. Hypertension:  She is restarted on her ace inhibitor and
   also started on Nifedipine as well.  She had been on this
   medication before in the past and was somehow discontinued
   monitoring her blood pressure.

1. Acute renal failure:  Her creatinine was elevated and her
   urine output decreased likely secondary to her prerenal
   state.  She was transfused and given intravenous fluids
   and her urine output picked up and her creatinine went
   back to her baseline of 1.0.

1. Cardiovascular:  She is status post pacemaker for sick
   sinus syndrome.  We held her aspirin given her bleeding.

1. Prolapsed bladder:  Local care.

1. Depression/dementia:  She was continued on her Celexa and
   Olanzapine.  Her Olanzapine dose was halved to 2.5 during
   this admission.

1. FEN:  She was originally kept NPO, but then advanced to
   clears and soft solids tolerating them well.  Her
   electrolytes were repleated as needed.

1. Prophylaxis:  She was on a proton pump inhibitor.  She
   received a physical therapy consult, which is currently
   pending at this time.  Communication was maintained with
   her daughter [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) **] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 103357**].  Her code status is
   DNR/DNI.
