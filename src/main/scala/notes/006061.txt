Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 10593**]
Chief Complaint:
fever, hypotension

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Dialysis
Central line placement and removal


History of Present Illness:
80M CKD, CAD s/p CABGx3, atrial fibrillation, DM2, systolic
heart failure (last EF 40-45%), valvular heart disease, ESRD on
HD (M,W,F) with right brachiocephalic fistula, PVD with venous
stasis ulceration that presented to ER after experiencing fever
at dialysis. He was triggered for hypotension on arrival for SBP
70. He was dialyzed today with 3 L taken off.

He went home and family felt he was warm and called 911. He
received tylenol and 300 mL  prior to arrival. Per records,
[**First Name3 (LF) **] pressure normally 90s/40s, and upon presentation in the
ER, his BP was 70s/40s.

The patient was unable to provide a significant amount of
history. It is unclear when his fever started and if it was
associated with HD.

Per Dr.[**Name (NI) 9388**] last note dated [**2135-4-1**], it was noted that he
had low [**Year/Month/Day **] pressure in clinic (VS documented around 90/60),
and it was decided that he should remain on atenolol for rate
control.

In the ED, initial VS were: 20:46 101.1 110 SBP 70 pOx 97%.

Patient was triggered for hypotension on arrival to SBP 70
(baseline in 90s).

Exam revealed a patient that was mentating well with stable
cardiopulmonary exam, distended abdomen, and + guiaic. Bilateral
lower extremities are warm and swollen with ? cellulitis vs.
venous stasis change.

Labs were performed:
- Chemistry panel with Cr 2.2, Glc 130; Mg 1.4, Ph 1.3
- CBC WBC 5.8, Hgb 10.1, MCV 109, Plt 69 with differential of
N77, Atyps 1, Metas 2 - lactate 1.3
- Troponin 0.08
- INR 1.6

Bedside US was performed with no pericardial effusion. IVC was
unable to be visualized. There was ? abdominal ascites.

Patient was 2 L IVF without improvement of [**Year/Month/Day **] pressure, which
remained 70s/40s. An LIJ was placed with an infusion of levophed
at 0.09 started with improvement of [**Year/Month/Day **] pressure to 89/51, HR
102.

He was started on vancomycin, cefepime, and flagyl. He was also
given tylenol for fever.

CXR showed no acute process.

ECG was performed showing atrial fibrillation with RVR with PVCs
at 109 bpm, IVCD (QRS 124 ms), leftward axis. Non-specific
lateral changes.

VS on transfer were not given.

On arrival to the MICU, patient's VS were BP 94/57 on levophed
0.12, HR 93, pOx 88 for which he was placed on 2 L NC with
improvement to 98 %. Patient was very somnolent upon arrival and
difficult to awake. He would open his eyes briefly and [**Doctor Last Name **]
somewhat intelligible statements.

ABG was performed showing pH 7.38 pCO2 58 pO2 159 HCO3 36. His
repeat lactate was within normal limits. ScVO2 was 87. His
pressor requirement increased from 0.1 --> 0.14. His initial CVP
was 18. NICOM was utilized - SVI increased by 19 % with passive
leg raise suggesting fluid responsiveness (patient was still
down 2 kg from baseline weight recently).

Radiology:
[**2135-6-3**]:
SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW OF THE CHEST: Patient is status post
median
sternotomy. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is mildly enlarged and
there is
vascular engorgement. Lungs are clear of focal opacities
concerning for
infectious process. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax. CVC has
been removed since the prior study.
IMPRESSION: Pulmonary vascular congestion without other acute
cardiopulmonary process.

[**2135-6-3**]:
HISTORY: Right IJ central line.
FINDINGS: There is a new right IJ central line with tip in the
distal SVC.  There continues to be moderate cardiomegaly with
pulmonary vascular
redistribution, without focal infiltrate or effusion. Sternotomy
wires are again seen. There is no pneumothorax.

Compared to the study from the prior day, there is no
