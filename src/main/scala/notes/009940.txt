Pertinent Results:
CXR ([**2182-9-25**]):
FINDINGS: PA and lateral views of the chest are obtained. A
Y-shaped stent is noted in the lower trachea and entering the
mainstem bronchi. The lungs are hyperexpanded with upper lobe
lucency and splaying of bronchovasculature as well as widened AP
diameter compatible with underlying emphysema. There is no
evidence of superimposed pneumonia or CHF. No pneumothorax is
seen. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is grossly unremarkable. Mild
atherosclerotic calcification is noted along the thoracic aorta.
The osseous structures are diffusely demineralized but appear
intact.

IMPRESSION: Emphysema, no evidence of acute superimposed
process. Tracheal stent in place.

Brief Hospital Course:
74 y/o F with PMHx of COPD, and TBM s/p silicone Y-stent on
[**2182-8-22**], followed by therapeutic bronch on [**9-5**], preseted on [**9-25**]
with cough and shortness of breath for five days.
.
On arrival to the floor, pt was c/o shortness of breath and
having difficultly clearing secretions.  Despite additional
nebs, and humidified O2, she triggered for increased RR.  She
was also desatting to high 80s and complaining of tiring out.
ABG was 7.42/30/59.  She was tranferred to the ICU.
.
On [**2182-9-26**], she received theapeutic bronchoscopy.  On [**2182-9-27**],
IP removed the  Y stent, given lack of improvement.  Patient
reported subjective improvement in breathing and ability to
cough up secretions. She was maintained on albuterol/atrovent
nebs, advair, and morphine for anxiety component.  She was
started on azithromycin for presumed COPD exacerbation. Patient
was not started on steroids in the ICU given previous history of
psychosis with prednisone. Upon transfer out of the MICU, she
was saturating at 95% on 5L of oxygen.
.
On the floor, pt had increased dyspnea, although she was on four
liters O2 and on q4h standing nebulizers.  She was started on
prednisone 40mg.  After two days and no improvement, prednisone
was increased to 60mg daily.  The pulmonary team was also
consultued and had no further recommendations.  She was also
given several empiric doses of lasix. Within two days she had
significant improvement.  She was tachypneic, though did not
desaturate when she would walk and climb stairs with physical
therapy.  She was discharged when stable on 2L, with home O2,
and outpatient pulmonary rehab.  She was instructed to call her
pulmonologist immediately upon reaching home and set an
appointment within one week.
.
Chronic diastolic heart failure: Pt is not maintained on any CHF
ppx meds at baseline and appeared euvolemic to dry on exam. She
had no crackles on lung exam or lower extremity edema, CXR
without signs of edema.  I/Os were net even throughout her
hospitalization.  She was given several doses of lasix,
empirically given no improvement in pulmonary symptoms and her
respiratory status improved to some degree, and it was thought
that she might have had some of fluid retention affecting her
respiratory status.
.
Smoking cessation: Smoking cessation was highly encouraged on a
daily basis by multiple teams.  She stated that boredome was the
most significant component to not quitting.  After this
experience, she stated she was encouraged and make every effort
to quit.
