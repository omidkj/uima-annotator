CT ABD/Pelvis:
1) Small bowel obstruction with transition point identified in a
large right ventral hernia. The bowel is maximally dilated to a
diameter of 4.2 cm. No free air or pneumatosis is identified.
2) Cholelithiasis without evidence of cholecystitis.

Renal US ([**2-16**]):
1) No evidence of hydronephrosis or calculi.
2) Cholelithiasis, without evidence of cholecystitis.

CXR:
1) Unchanged appearance of right subclavian central venous
catheter, which
terminates within the SVC. No associated pneumothorax.
2) Small bilateral pleural effusions and associated atelectatic
changes.


Brief Hospital Course:
NEURO:  on home psyche med regimen, AOx3
CV:  borderline tachycardic but stable pressures
RESP: no issues
FEN/GI: on home diet.  Abdominal wound and graft require
attention in rehab
RENAL:  CRI known and at baseline

Pt was admitted from the ED on [**2-13**] with a partial SBO secondary
to a recalcitrant ventral hernia, without signs of
strangulation.  She was made NPO with an NG tube in preparation
for surgery.  She was taken to the OR on HD#2 for the above
procedure.  The operation was without complication or finding
necessitation a change in pre-operative diagnosis.  However, she
experienced a difficult extubation post-operatively and remained
intubed in the PACU until the AM of POD#1 (HD#3).  During this
period of time, she was noted to be oliguric despite repeated
fluid boli, likely secondary to her know CRI.  After extubation,
she was transferred to the TSICU for closer observation and
monitoring of her fluid status.  A renal consult was also
obtained at this time for help in managing her acute-on-chronic
CRI.  A central line was placed, and her renal output improved
with resolution of her 4L fluid deficit; she was transferred to
the floor on POD#4.  She was kept NPO until POD#5, at which time
she was advanced to clears.  Since her extubation, she had
exhibited a somewhat obtunded mental status, however, this too
improved gradually to her preop baseline by POD#8.  Also, since
the OR, pt had been borderline tachycardic with HRs to 95-105
without a clear etiology.  By POD#8, her pain was completely
controlled on an oral regimen.  On POD#9, she tolerated a full
PO diet, and IVF was d/c'ed.  She was considered stable for D/C
at this time, but was kept over the weekend due to placement
issues before finally being d/c'ed on [**2-26**].

Through this [**Hospital **] hospital course and participation of the
Primary care UMG service was appreciated.
