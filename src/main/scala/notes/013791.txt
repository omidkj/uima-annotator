[**Hospital1 18**] ECHOCARDIOGRAPHY REPORT

Prebypass

The left atrium is dilated. No atrial septal defect is seen by
2D or color Doppler. Regional left ventricular wall motion is
normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF>55%). [Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is
likely more depressed given the severity of valvular
regurgitation.] Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Moderate (2+)
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is partial mitral leaflet flail ( P2
scallop]. Severe (4+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is no
pericardial effusion. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in person of the
results on [**2105-8-21**] at 1130am.

Postbypass

Patient is in sinus rhythm receiving an infusion of
phenylephrine and epinephrine. Annuloplasty ring seen in the
mitral position and appears well seated. The mitral
regurgitation was 2+ immediately post bypass. After a few
minutes the mitral regurgitation is 1+. Aortic regurgitation is
2+. Aorta intact post decannulation. LVEF is now 40%.
  I certify that I was present for this procedure in compliance
with HCFA regulations.

Brief Hospital Course:
[**8-21**] Mr.[**Known lastname 82780**] was taken to the operating room and underwent
Mitral Valve repair (#28mm [**Doctor Last Name 405**] Band)/Aortotomy. Cross clamp
time=74 minutes. Cardiopulmonary Bypass time=90minutes. Please
refer to Dr[**Last Name (STitle) **] operative report for further details. He
tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to the CVICU in
critical but stable condition, requiring pressors to optimize
cardiac output. He awoke neurologically intact and was extubated
without difficulty. He was weaned from all drips. Beta- Blocker
and diuresis was intitiated. All lines and drains were
discontinued in a timely fashion. POD#1 he continued to progress
and was transferred to the step down unit for further
monitoring. Physical Thaerapy was consulted and evaluated. The
remainder of Mr.[**Known lastname 82781**] postoperative course was essentially
unremarkable. On POD# 4 he was cleared by Dr.[**Last Name (STitle) **] for
discharge to home with VNA. All follow up appointments were
