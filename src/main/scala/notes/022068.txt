Chief Complaint:
Tracheostomy

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Tracheostomy
Bronchoscopy


History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 63y/o gentleman with a PMH of COPD and
tracheomalacia s/p tracheostomy in [**2115**] admitted for T tube
placement. The patient had a bowel obstruction [**5-6**] leading to
ischemic bowel and perforation c/b septic shock. He was
intubated for an extended period of time and underwent
tracheostomy [**8-5**]. Trach was decannulated [**8-6**]. Her reported
improvement for one month after returning home then developed
dyspnea, sputum production and wheezing. He underwent a CT scan
which revealed narrowing of the trachea with a disruption of the
tracheal ring at that same site.
.
The patient underwent a flexible bronchoscopy [**2-7**] which
demonstrated a proximal trachea fracture and moderate
tracheomalacia. He is currently requiring O2 3L NC. The patient
is admitted for bronchoscopy with tracheostomy placement.

         Staphylococcus species may develop resistance during
prolonged
         therapy with quinolones.   Therefore, isolates that are
initially
         susceptible may become resistant within three to four
days after
         initiation of therapy.  Testing of repeat isolates may
be
         warranted.
         This isolate is presumed to be resistant to clindamycin
based on
         the detection of inducible resistance .

IMAGING:
[**5-8**] CXR: No previous studies available for direct comparison.
There is a
tracheostomy tube with distal tip at the level of the clavicular
heads. There is diffuse pulmonary interstitial prominence,
particularly at the right base. This is suggestive of chronic
disease; however, comparison to old films would be more helpful
to establish interval change. There is cardiomegaly. There is
volume loss on the right side. The left lung is well aerated
without focal consolidation or pleural effusions.
.
[**5-10**] CXR: In comparison with the study of [**5-8**], there is little
change.
Tracheostomy tube remains in place. Continued hyperexpansion of
the lungs
with mild enlargement of the cardiac silhouette and prominence
of the
ascending aorta, raising the possibility of hypertension.
Diffuse prominence of interstitial markings is again consistent
with chronic lung disease. This is somewhat more prominent at
the right base, which could be a manifestation of superimposed
pneumonia.
.

Brief Hospital Course:
63 year old man with a PMH of COPD and tracheomalacia status
post tracheostomy [**2115**] admitted for bronchoscopy and
tracheostomy.
.
# Tracheomalacia: S/p rigid bronchoscopy in the OR with
tracheostomy placement. Pt with significant obstructive airways
disease.  He was observed overnight in the MICU as per standard
protocol and then called back out to the floor.  Pt tolerated
the procedure well and had no complications.  He was started on
mucomyst and codeine-guafenesin to manage secretions. He will
follow-up with IP as an outpatient.
.
# Hospital-acquired pneumonia: Pt developed leukocytosis and low
grade fever after the procedure.  This was felt to be possibly
inflammatory in setting of recent procedure, however CXR was
suspicious for a RLL infiltrate and the patient had a large
amount of tracheal secretions.  He was treated with a 7-day
course of levofloxacin.  WBC returned to [**Location 213**] and he had no
further fevers.  Sputum culture was consistent with likely
oropharyngeal contamination.
.
# HTN: Continued HCTZ.
.
# Hyperlipidemia: Continued simvastatin.
.
# BPH: Continued terazosin.
.
# Anxiety/Depression: Continued Lexapro and trazodone.
