Attending:[**Doctor First Name 1402**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac cath


History of Present Illness:
71M with CAD s/p CABG [**10/2105**], CHF (EF 30%), frequent admits for
CHF exacerbation who was transferred from the [**Hospital1 1516**] service with
hypertensive emergency. He initially presented to the ED after
acute SOB on [**12-22**] while at rest. He states he was lying on his
couch with his feet up when he became acutely SOB. He denies
associated chest pain. He sat up and felt slightly better. He
denies recent dietary indiscretion, med change, or med
noncompliance. He reports 2lb weight gain, occasional mid-chest
tightness with exertion at baseline. After 30 minutes, his
symptoms had not improved so he called EMS. EMS reports BP
240/110, HR 72, and O2sat 100% on NRB, with labored breathing.
He received 40mg IV Lasix en route to the ED. In the ED, his BP
was 209/103, O2sat 93% on RA, c/o headache, no respiratory
distress. EKG with no evidence of ischemia. He was started on
NTG drip and given IV enalapril 1.25mg IV. His BP improved to
175/101. He also received ASA 325mg and percocet x 2. He was
admitted to [**Hospital1 1516**]. On the floor his BP was 130s/60s. He was taken
for L and R heart cath to evaluate his grafts. In the cath lab,
his grafts, including LIMA-LAD, SVG-RCA, and SVG-OM1, were
patent. His L subclavian artery and stent were patent. Her R
renal artery had 60% stenosis with no significant stenosis.
During the case, his BP was 190s-220s/110s-120s. He received NTG
300mcg bolus + drip, fentanyl 25mcg, versed 0.5mg, Lasix 20mg
IV, and heparin 1000U IV. R heart cath showed PCWP of 31. He was
transferred to the CCU for management of hypertensive emergency
and CHF exacerbation.
.
Currently, he continues to complain of headache. He denies chest
pain, shortness of breath, confusion, back pain, abdominal pain.
His femoral arterial sheath was pulled at 4pm.

Cardiac Cath [**2106-12-23**]:
COMMENTS:
1. Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system
demonstrated LMCA and 3 vessel native coronary artery disease.
The LMCA
had severe diffuse disease with heavy calcification. the LAD had

proximal 90% stenosis with heavy clacification. The distal
vessel had
competitive flow from [**Female First Name (un) 899**]. The LCX was a non-dominant vessel
that was
occluded proximally. The RCA was a dominant vessel and was
occluded
proximally. The SVG-OM1 was patent without lesions. The SVG-RCA
was
patent without lesions. The LIMA-LAD was patent.
2. The LSCA had no demonstrable gradient across the proximal
stent which
was difficult to engage. Non-selective [**Female First Name (un) 899**] angiography
demonstrated no
critical lesions in the LSC or the origin fo the [**Female First Name (un) 899**].
3. Right renal artery angiography demonstrated 60% lesion that
did not
have significant gradient with vasodilator therapy.
4. Resting hemodynamics were performed. The right sided filling
pressures were mildly elevated (mean RA pressure was 9mmHg and
RVEDP was
14mmHg). The pulmonary artery pressures were elevated measuring
54/16mmHg. The left sided filling pressures were elevated (mean
PCW
pressure was 31mmHg and LVEDP was 36mmHg). The systemic arterial

pressures were significant elevated measuring 198/86mmHg. The
cardiac
index was reduced measuring 2.1 l/min/m2. There was no
significant
gradient across the aortic valve upon pull back of the catheter
from the
left ventricle to the ascending aorta.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. LMCA and native 3 vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Patent LIMA-LAD, SVG-OM2 and SVG-PDA.
3. Elevated left and right sided filling pressures.
4. Depressed cardiac index.
5. Non-hemodynamically significant right renal artery stenosis.

Head CT [**2105-12-24**]:
FINDINGS: There is no hemorrhage, mass effect, or shift of
normally midline structures. There is no evidence of infarction.
Low attenuation in the periventricular white matter is
consistent with chronic microvascular infarction and was seen on
[**2107-1-4**]. However, a right caudate lacunar infarction is
also old. The [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter differentiation is preserved.
There is a new linear calcification in the region of the right
middle cerebral artery within the sylvian fissure. The
visualized paranasal sinuses are clear. The bones are
unremarkable.
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of hemorrhage or mass effect. No evidence of
infarction. Note that MRI with diffusion-weighted imaging is
more sensitive.
2. New linear area of calcification along the right middle
cerebral artery in the region of the right sylvian fissure.
While this may represent atherosclerosis, an underlying aneurysm
should be suspected. Correlation with CT angiography is
recommended for further evaluation.
.
[**2105-12-26**] MRI/A:
FINDINGS, BRAIN MRI:
There are several areas of slow diffusion identified in the
brain. These areas are small and noted in the right posterior
frontal, left frontal subcortical, right occipital subcortical,
and left medial occipital cortical regions indicative of small
acute infarcts. Location in both cerebral hemispheres suggests
embolic event. There is mild-to-moderate brain atrophy and small
vessel disease seen in the periventricular and subcortical white
matter. A chronic small right cerebellar infarct is identified.
There is no mass effect or midline shift seen.
IMPRESSION: Several small cortical and subcortical areas of slow
diffusion indicative of acute infarcts.
MRA OF THE HEAD:
The head MRA demonstrates normal flow signal within the arteries
of anterior and posterior circulation. No evidence of [**Month/Day/Year 1106**]
occlusion or high-grade stenosis seen. There is no evidence of
aneurysm visualized at the site of calcifications seen on CT.
However, on susceptibility-weighted images, a subtle low-signal
intensity seen in this region indicating presence of the CT-
demonstrated calcification. This calcification could be due to
calcif
