suicidality.
Reviewed chart.  Case presented to me by PG3 psychiatry
resident,
Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 18758**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].  Please see PG2 psychiatry resident, Dr.
[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 714**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 70633**] initial note dated [**2169-12-23**] and PG3
psychiatry resident, Dr.[**Name (NI) 70634**] note dated [**2169-12-25**] for full
details of HPI, past psych hx, pmh, meds, all, social hx, family
hx, substance abuse hx, and labs.

CC:[**CC Contact Info 70635**]
HPI:  In brief, this is a 62y/o woman who reports chronic
depressive sx's since her childhood punctuated by recurrent,
more
severe depressive episodes throughout her life.  She states that
she has been especially depressed for the past year (depressed
mood, anergia, poor concentration, anhedonia, and passive SI)
and
relates this to her ongoing medical issues and progressively
deteriorating health.
      Currently, patient is admitted c sepsis secondary to
enterocutaneous fistula.  She has appeared quite dysphoric and
has expressed suicidal ideation to primary team.  However,
patient has been consistent in stating that her passive suicidal
thoughts are chronic, and that she would never kill herself
secondary to her love of husband and her devout religious
beliefs.

ROS:  Depressed, occ migraines, unable to ambulate, speech
impairment.  O/w all other sx's neg

O/VS:
MSE:  Morbidly obese woman lying in bed in [**Male First Name (un) 18786**].  Speech

directed. No ah/vh. No overt delusions.  Mood "depressed"

Imp:  62y/o female c chronic depressive sx's c/w "double
depression" -- dysthymic d/o and major depressive d/o.  She has
benefitted significantly from her fluoxetine rx, however this
has not resulted in a remission of her depression.  Referral for
psychiatrist and psychotherapist to get better hold on
depression is reasonable, however patient not willing to agree
to this at present time.
      However, there are some major social and religious issues
that could be addressed to result in significant improvement in
her quality of life.  She is devoutly religious, lives a mile
and a half away from her church, but is unable to make it to
church as she is not able to ambulate.  Additionally, she and
her husband eat very poorly as there able to cook is quite
limited (homemaker or nurse shop for them).

Rec:
In addition to recommendations in Dr.[**Name (NI) 70634**] note, would add:
    -social work consult to see if we could facilitate Meals on
Wheels
    -chaplain consult to address religious issues and see if we
can arrange to have minister or representative from her church
to make home visits for her as she is unable to make it to
church due to her physical limitations.





Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to the TSICU for hypotension, fever,
abdominal pain and presumed sepsis on [**2169-12-18**] from a nursing
home. She was started on broad spectrum antibiotics (Vancomycin,
levofloxacin, and Flagyl) pending pan-cultures. Her TPN was
continued for nutritional support via her previously placed PICC
line. She was fluid resuscitated and her fistula was evaluated
for any change in output or appearance. A CT scan of her abdomen
revealed no evidence of change in her fistula or any evidence of
other intraabdominal process. A chest xray on admission was also
read as unremarkable.

On hospital day 5, her blood cultures grew out [**Female First Name (un) 564**]
Parapsilosis from 2/4 bottles as well as [**Female First Name (un) 564**] Albicans in her
urine. Her vancomycin was discontinued and the infectious
disease service was [**Female First Name (un) 4221**] for treatment guidance and further
exploration of her infection. It has been recommended that she
continue with Caspofungin for a total of 14 day course; a PICC
line was placed on [**12-26**] so that she may continue with this
course of IV antibiotics. her diet was advanced; fistula output
was monitored closely; she is tolerating a regular/heart healthy
diet.
