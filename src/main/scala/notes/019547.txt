Service: CARDIOTHORACIC

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1505**]
Chief Complaint:
Fatigue/Dyspnea on exertion

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2189-12-8**] - Mitral Valve Repair with 28mm Annuloplasty Ring and
resection of P2.


History of Present Illness:
This 61-year-old gentleman has a well-known history of mitral
regurgitation followed by serial echocardiograms.  His most
recent echocardiogram revealed severe MR, which is worse since
his prior echocardiogram.  He is symptomatic with fatigue, DOE,
and had a presyncopal episode on [**2189-11-10**] last
week.  An echocardiogram on [**2189-8-13**] showed an LVEF of
55%.  No VSD or ASD, 4+ MR with the prolapse of the anterior and
posterior leaflets, 2+ TR, no AS or AI.  MR was very likely
severe 4+ as regurgitation enters the pulmonary veins.  Carotid
ultrasound on [**2189-7-31**] showed no significant stenosis.
Cardiac catheterization was performed on [**2189-11-11**] at
[**Hospital3 **], which has not been dictated at this time.

Past Medical History:
Past medical history is significant for hypertension, mitral
regurgitation, hyperlipidemia, pneumonia in the past, erectile
dysfunction, prostate cancer, and bladder cancer.  He had a
radical prostatectomy in [**2187**], has also had surgery for bladder
cancer, and a veins stripping in his left leg.


Social History:
He is currently retired at this time.  Mr. [**Known lastname 81539**] last
dental exam was in [**2189-4-30**].  He quit smoking nine years ago but
has a 20 pack-year history.  He occasionally uses alcohol.  He
is currently living with his brother.  [**Name (NI) **] [**Name2 (NI) **] a motorcycle.
He denies any IV drug use.

Family History:
His brother had a myocardial infarction at age 55.

Physical Exam:
On examination, his heart rate is 95.  Blood pressure is 153/101
taken in the left arm.  He is saturating 98% on room air.  He is
in no apparent distress.  His skin is remarkable for multiple
tattoos and a well-healed abdominal scar.  His teeth are in poor
repair.  Neck is supple with full range of motion.  Lungs are
clear bilaterally.  Heart rate is in regular rate and rhythm
with a grade IV/VI holosystolic murmur that radiates all the way
to his axilla.  Abdomen is soft, nontender, and nondistended
with positive bowel sounds.  Extremities are warm and well
perfused without any peripheral edema or varicosities noted.  He
is neurologically grossly intact and has 2+ bilateral femoral
DP, PT, and radial pulses.  No carotid bruits are appreciated.


Pertinent Results:
ECHO [**2189-12-8**]
PRE-BYPASS: The left atrium is moderately dilated. No atrial
septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular
wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic
function are normal (LVEF >55%). Right ventricular chamber size
and free wall motion are normal. There are simple atheroma in
the descending thoracic aorta. There are three aortic valve
leaflets. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is partial mitral leaflet flail. Moderate to
severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Due to the eccentric
nature of the regurgitant jet, its severity may be significantly
underestimated (Coanda effect). There is no pericardial
effusion.

POST-BYPASS: The patient is in sinus rhythm. Left and right
ventricular function is preserved. The aorta is intact. The
mitral valve has been repaired and an annuloplasty ring has been
placed. The mitral leaflets are functioning normally. There is
no MR. [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 19720**] of the examination is unchanged.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2189-12-8**] for elective
surgical management of his mitral valve disease. He was taken
directly to the operating room where he underwent a mitral valve
repair. Please see operative note for details. Postoperatively
he was taken to the cardiac intensive care unit for monitoring.
Within 24 hours, he had awoke neurologically intact and was
extubated. On postoperative day one, he was transferred to the
step down unit for further recovery. He was gently diuresed
towards his preoperative weight. The physical therapy service
was consulted for assistance with his postoperative strength and
mobility. His chest tubes and epicardial wires were removed.  By
post-operative day four he was ready for discharge to home.
