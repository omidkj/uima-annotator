Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7651**]
Chief Complaint:
V. Fib arrest/ STEMI

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intra-aortic Balloon pump removal
Pulmonary intubation


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 89928**] is a 77 year-old creole-speaking male with PMH of [**Hospital **]
transferred from OSH s/p STEMI c/b Vfib arrest with now with BMS
x 2 to LCX, on pressors with IABP placement. Patient initially
presented to [**Hospital3 417**] Hospital with intermittent chest
pain x 3 days. EKG showed ST depressions in V1-V4 with more
pronounced R:S ratios and minimal ST elevations in II, III, and
aVF concering with an acute posterior STEMI. While in the ED, he
had unwitnessed VT that degenerated to VF arrest. He received
CPR with epi x 1 and shock x 2; he subsequently had return of
sinus rhythm and spontaneous respiration with severe agitation
requiring intubation. Emergent catheterization showed 2 vessel
disease with 40% mid-LAD disease, sequential 90% proximal 70%
distal and 90% ostial RCA lesions and 100% occlusion mid left
circumflex. Overlapping 2.25 x 15mm and 2.5 x 12mm BMS were
placed in the mid circumflex. Wedge pressure was elevated to 17,
PA systolic pressure was elevated to 43; and an aortic ballon
pump was placed to augment his cardiac output. Dopamine was
started during cardiac catheterization because of SBPs in low
70s. He is now admitted to the CCU for further care.

On inital evaluation in the CCU, he is sedated and unresponsive.
Upon weaning sedation and with minial manipulation within the
bed, Mr. [**Known lastname 89928**] become more alert and with his family at the
bedside was able to move all 4 limbs and follow commands.

On review of systems, patient's family endorse that he had
complained of decreased exercise tolerance and leg "heaviness".
His family denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous
thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery,
myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red
stools. They deny recent fevers, chills or rigors. All of the
other review of systems were negative.

Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of paroxysmal
nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, palpitations, syncope or
presyncope.

Imaging:
CXR: [**3-23**]
An ET tube terminates 1.2 cm above the carina. There is an
intraaortic
balloon pump which terminates at the level of the carina. A
femoral approach catheter terminates more laterally. A
transesophageal catheter extends to at least the level of the
stomach. The heart size is normal. Central vascular congestion
with mild interstitial edema is present. A slightly lordotic
view limits evaluation at the costophrenic angles, however,
there is suggestion of a left pleural effusion.

CXR: [**2102-3-25**]:
The ET tube, the NG tube, and the femoral approach catheter are
in unchanged position. Intra-aortic balloon pump continues to be
rather low, 8 cm below the aortic root. The minimal degree of
interstitial edema in the left lung has resolved. There is no
change in bilateral pleural effusions. There are no focal
changes to suggest interval development of infectious process
such as pneumonia or aspiration pneumonia.

ECHO: [**2102-3-24**]:
The left atrium is elongated. There is symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. There is mild regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction with basal inferior and inferolateral (posterior)
akinesis. The remaining segments exhibit compensatory
hyperkinesis (LVEF = 45%). There is no ventricular septal
defect. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to
acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may be
significantly UNDERestimated.] The pulmonary artery systolic
pressure could not be determined. There is no pericardial
effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction,
c/w inferoposterior infarction. No evidence of mechanical MI
complications. No echocardiographic evidence of low-output state
while on IABP support.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 89928**] is a 77 year-old creole-speaking male with PMH of [**Hospital **]
transferred from OSH s/p STEMI c/b Vfib arrest with now with BMS
x 2 to LCX, on pressors with IABP placement.

#. Cardiogenic shock: He was transferred from OSH with
cardiogenic shock (low cardiac index, elevated CVP/ PWP, high
SVR, hypotension) requiring pressors and intra-aortic balloon
pump. Etiology secondary to STEMI (see below) s/p
revascularization with BMS x 2 to left circumflex.  During CCU
stay, hemodynamics were monitored with aortic ballon pump,
arterial line, swan ganz catheter and urine output with goal MAP
> 65, UOP 50cc/hr and CVP 12 -14 (higher goal [**2-15**] likely RV
infarct). While on intra-aortic balloon pump, patient maintained
on heparin gtt and monitored for complications. Of note, he did
develop mild thrombocytopenia and symptoms worrying for
progressive limb ischemia with decreased peripheral pulses and
rising CK. As hemodynamics improved dopamine was discontinued
and he was weaned off intra-aortic balloon pump. Echocardiogram
