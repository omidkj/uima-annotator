Brief Hospital Course:
Transferred in from outside hospital after cardiac
catheterization on nitroglycerin drip and femoral sheath to
intensive care unit. He underwent preoperative workup and was
transferred to the floor on hospital day two on heparin, sheath
removed, for completion of preoperative workup.
The patient was brought to the operating room on [**2110-11-19**] where he
underwent CABGx4 with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  Please see op report for
details.  Overall the patient tolerated the procedure well and
post-operatively was transferred to the CVICU in stable
condition for invasive monitoring.  The patient does have a
history of diabetes and blood glucose was difficult to manage
following surgery.  [**Last Name (un) **] was consulted, and we appreciate
their recommendations.  Blood glucose came under good control,
and he was transferred to the telemetry floor.  Beta blockade
and diuresis were initiated.  Chest tubes and pacing wires were
discontinued without complication.  PT worked with the patient
on strength and mobility.  By POD 5 the patient was ambulating
freely, the wound was healing and pain was controlled with oral
analgesics.  He was found suitable for discharge to home with
VNA at this time.  He will be on insulin at home and he did
undergo insulin teaching prior to discharge.
