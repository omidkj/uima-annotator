Allergies:
Aspirin / Penicillins

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1115**]
Chief Complaint:
flu like symptoms & hypertension

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 51 year-old man with a history of asthma,
hypertension, and cocaine use who presented to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED on
[**2122-11-19**] with a non-productive cough, chest pain, and DOE.
Patient states tht the symptoms began on the morning of [**11-19**],
when he woke up. Described [**10-17**] substernal chest pain,
radiating to L arm, mildy associated with exertion, not
associated w/ position. He does not have a history of an
'anginal equivalent', but had negative atypical CP work-up at
[**Hospital1 112**] in [**2120**] including stress test.  He reports nausea, vomiting,
and subjective fevers at home (although he did not take his
temperature). He also reports a headache ([**10-17**], involving whole
head, +photosensitivity).  Denies neck stiffness, vision loss,
confusion, or seizures.  States that he takes 4
anti-hypertensive medications at home, but does not know the
name of his medications. He denies sick contacts.
.
In ED, initial VS were 100.8 96 191/102 20 100% on RA. Patient
had CXR negative for pneumonia, negative cardiac enzymes, and a
normal D Dimer.  EKG with J point elevation in V1-V3, unchanged
from previous EKG of [**2-/2120**] from [**Hospital1 112**] (with exception of resolved
sinus bradycardia). Head CT without evidence of bleed, but with
changes concerning for PRES. Chest pain resolved w/ SL nitro,
nitro paste, morphine 12 mg IV, and combivent nebs. SBP was
noted to be 191/102, and due to headache and chest pain,
labetolol gtt was initiated due to concern for hypertensive
emergency, and patient was admitted to MICU.
.
During MICU course, labetolol gtt was weaned and patient was
placed back on home meds of oral labetolol 100 mg PO BID, hctz
25 mg PO daily, amlodipine 10 mg PO daily, and valsartan 80 mg
PO daily (confirmed w/ physician at [**Hospital1 **], but are
about a year old). SBPs decreased to 160s/90s with oral
medication. Nasopharyngeal aspirates returned + for influenza A.
Patient also with dirty U/A (6-10 WBCs), but he is does not have
dysuria. Prostate exam reveals no tenderness. Tox screen + only
for opiates, neg for cocaine, but received morphine in the ED.
D-dimer low, and CEs neg x2. Patient called out to medicine
floor for further treatment.
.

CXR - [**11-19**]:
FINDINGS: The lungs are clear. There is no pneumonia. There is
no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Hilar, mediastinal, and
cardiac silhouettes are within normal limits.
IMPRESSION: No pneumonia.
.
Head CT - [**11-19**]:
FINDINGS: There is no evidence of acute hemorrhage, large acute
territory infarction, or large masses. There are bilateral
patchy non-confluent hypodense foci, predominantly in
subcortical white matter distribution, could be due to chronic
small vessel ischemic changes; however, it could also be
manifestation of acute hypertensive encephalopathy (Posterior
Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome [PRES]). Ventricles and sulci
are normal in size and configuration. There is no shift of
midline structures. Visualized portion of the paranasal sinuses
and mastoid air cells are within normal limits.
IMPRESSION:
1. No bleed.
2. Subcortical bilateral white matter foci of hypodensity, in a
patchy pattern, which could be due to chronic small vessel
ischemic changes, or manifestation of acute hypertensive
encephalopathy, PRES.

MR [**Name13 (STitle) 430**]: IMPRESSION:
1. No definite evidence of acute intracranial process.
2. Though the extensive multifocal white matter abnormalities in
both the
supra- and infratentorial compartments are highly nonspecific,
they are most consistent with chronic microvascular infarction,
particularly in setting of poorly-controlled hypertension. Given
the extent of involvement, the relative asymmetry and the
sparing of the posterior parietooccipital subcortical white
matter would militate against PRES, though this entity cannot be
completely excluded. Arguing in favor of chronic hypertensive
small vessel disease are the likely chronic hemorrhagic lacune
in the right cerebellar hemisphere, and
at least one "microbleed" elsewhere. 3. The involvement of the
subcortical white matter of the anterior temporal poles,
bilaterally, as well as the very peripheral extensive
subcortical white matter abnormality, elsewhere, raises the
possibility of underlying CADASIL.
This should be correlated with any history of chronic episodic
headaches and dementia in this patient, as well as in any
first-deg
