Attending:[**Doctor First Name 1402**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest Pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 58 year old male with a history of DM, HTN,
dyslipidemia,PVD, CAD with history of MI, who transfered for
cardiac catheterization for a question of NSTEMI in the setting
of infection.  As noted, the patient has a history of CAD, with
an MI in [**2152**], for which he PCI to RCA in [**2152**] at [**Hospital1 336**].  The
patient has not had any further chest pain since his MI.  He
reports a baseline exercise tolerance of 5 blocks, limited by
fatigue.

The patinet was admitted to [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] on [**11-28**], after
presenting with complaints of N/V x 1 day.  The patients wife
was [**Name2 (NI) 7450**] admitted a few days prior with similar GI
symptoms, and was diagnosed with viral gasteroenteritis.  On
presentation the patient was found to be hypotensive in the 80s,
febrile to 102.9, was treated with IVF, and one dose of
CTX/azythro.  The patinet denies any diahrea or bloody stool.
He had continued n/v, fever, and mild abdominal discomfort.  He
was given continued IVF for supportive care in treatment of
presumed viral gastroenteritis.  His chest XR on admission was
unremarkable, and he was satting on 96% on RA.

On the evening of [**11-30**] at the OSH, the patient developed acute
shortness of breath.  A CXR was obtained, which was concerning
to the team for infiltrates.  He was reportedly started on
CXR/Azythro, but no documentation is available that he received
those antibiotics.  he denies any recent productive cough.
Blood cultures were also obtained.  In this setting, the patient
had ocmplaints of chest pain, similar, but less intense than
prior MI.  Described chest discomfort as sub-sternal chest
pressure, scaled to [**4-23**], radiation to the shoulder.  This chest
discomfort was relieved with SLNG.  An EKG was obtained, which
was concerning of a question of lateral ST depressions, and
cardiac markers were elevated.  The patient was started in
heparin, palvix, ASA, and metprolol, and was transfered to [**Hospital1 18**]
for cardiac catheterization.

While being transported, the patient had continued chest pain,
which again was relieved with SLNG.  He has been chest pain free
since.  In the holding area, the patient had continued hypoxia,
requiring 100% NRB.  He continued to be febrile, spiking a
temperature of 101.6  Cardiac catheterization was deffered, and
the patient was admitted to the CCU for futher care.

On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
He denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other
review of systems were negative.

Cardiac review of systems is notable for the absence paroxysmal
nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope
or presyncope.

Studies:
CXR [**11-30**]: There are bilateral interstitial and alveolar
perihilar opacities, consistent with moderate-to-severe
pulmonary edema.  There is a left basilar opacity which may
represent a combination of pulmonary edema, pleural effusion,
and atelectasis. However, superimposed consolidation cannot be
excluded.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is obscured.  There
is no pneumothorax.
IMPRESSION: 1.  MODERATE-TO-SEVERE CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE.
2.LT BASILAR CONSOLIDATION AND/OR LEFT PLEURAL EFFUSION CANNOT
BE EXCLUDED.
.
EKG [**2157-12-1**]:
ST at 100, physiologic left axis, 1mm ST depressions V5, TWI in
v4-V6, q waves in III, avF.
.
TTE ([**12-1**]): The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular
cavity size is normal. There is mild to moderate regional left
ventricular systolic dysfunction with akinetic areas involving
the posterobasal septum and adjacent posterior wall and the
anterior septum and LV apex. A left ventricular mass/thrombus
cannot be excluded. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic
regurgitation. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with
trivial mitral regurgitation.

Brief Hospital Course:
58 year old male with a history of DM, HTN, dyslipdemia and CAD
s/p IMI with a troponin leak likely secondary to demand ischemia
in the setting of infection.
.
CORONARY DISEASE
The patient was transferred for mildly elevated troponins in the
setting of infection.  Cardiac cath was deferred secondary to
infection and the patient was managed conservatively with
aspirin, statin, plavix, integrilin and heparin.  The integrilin
and heparin were stopped on [**2157-12-3**].  The patient remained
chest pain free and his elevated troponins were likely due to
demand ischemia and not acute coronary syndrome.  A TTE was
performed at [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] showing worsened global systolic
function and an EF of 35% (decreased from 65%), new posterior
wall, anterior septum and apical akinesis.  This was likely from
cardiac stunning in the setting of demand ischemia or
toxic-metabolic in origin due to his infection.  His metoprolol
was continued and his ACE was held in the setting of acute renal
failure.  His Lisinopril 20
