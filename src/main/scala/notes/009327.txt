Chief Complaint:
Pneumonia, septic shock

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac catheterization [**3-13**]

History of Present Illness:
This is a 61 year old female with PMH of interstitial lung
disease presenting from an OSH for concern of septic shock in
the setting of possible PNA vs. pancreatic process on imaging.
Patient is intubated and sedated, so the history was obtained
per outside records.  Review of the record indicates that her
symptoms began 5 days prior with SOB, cough, and sputum
production.  The SOB gradually worsened, especially with
activity, and she had fevers/chills per the record.  No n/v/d,
HA/neck pain.  She did have a diffuse mild back ache the day
prior to admission per her husband.  [**Name (NI) **] dysuria.
.
At OSH, she arrived in respiratory distress and was started on
BiPAP with initial improvement per report.  CXR was read as PNA
in setting of interstitial lung disease.  UA was negative.  She
then became hypotensive with SBPs in the 60s despite 2L IVFs and
her RR was in the 50s per report.  She was intubated prior to
transfer and was started on peripheral levophed.  Her labs prior
to transfer were significant for a WBC of 12.5, lactate 3.2, and
Cr 1.1.
.
In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, initial VS were: T: 102, HR: 106, MAPs of 65 on
levophed .21mcg/kg/min, and 100% on 80% FiO2.  She was not
making urine initially but was given 6 liters IVFs and
ultimately made 400 cc while in the ED. Lactate also trended
down from 3.2 to 1.3.  She was given CTX and azithromycin at OSH
for CAP and no further abx were given in the ED.  A left
subclavian was placed.  A CT torso was  performed and
prelimiarily suggestive of a pneumonia superimposed on chronic
interstital lung disease changes.  The was no PE, but there was
evidence of gall bladder distention and fat stranding around the
head of his pancreas.  A bedside u/s in the ED did not
appreciate a pericardial effusion.  Her EKG showed a rate of 99,
NA/NI, no STEMI. VS prior to transfer: 69, 141/84 on
.12mcg/kg/min of levophed, 16 500 5peep 80fio2 100%
.
On arrival to the MICU, patient is intubated and sedated.
Repeat EKG on arrival showed ST elevations in I, avL, and V2 and
a code STEMI was called.

Pertinent Results:
[**3-13**] ECHO:
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There is moderate to
severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with near
akinesis of the distal third of the ventricle and severe
hypokinesis of the mid inferior and inferolateral walls. The
basal segments contract well (LVEF 30-35%). The apex is mildly
aneurysmal/akinetic.. No masses or thrombi are seen in the left
ventricle. Right ventricular chamber size is normal. with mild
global free wall hypokinesis. The diameters of aorta at the
sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation. The
mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral
regurgitation. There is no mitral valve prolapse. There is mild
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
effusion.

IMPRESSION: Normal left ventricular cavity size with apical
aneurysm and dysfunction c/w Takostubo cardiomyopathy or mid-LAD
disease. Pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.

CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS:
Based on [**2136**] AHA endocarditis prophylaxis recommendations, the
echo findings indicate prophylaxis is NOT recommended. Clinical
decisions regarding the need for prophylaxis should be based on
clinical and echocardiographic data.
.
[**3-13**] Cardiac Cath:
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Coronary arteries are normal.
2. Severe diastolic ventricular dysfunction.
3. Severe pulmonary hypertension.
.
[**3-13**] CTA chest/abdomen:
IMPRESSION:
1. Fibrotic changes in the lungs with bilateral lower lobe
predominance.
Denser peribronchovascular opacities and scattered ground-glass
opacities are
concerning for acute superimposed infection. No evidence of
pulmonary
embolism.

2. Fat stranding in the upper abdomen, predominantly surrounding
the
pancreatic head. Mild distention of the gallbladder and dilation
of CBD.
Gallbladder wall edema versus pericholecystic fluid. These
findings could
indicate pancreatitis or possible biliary source of infection.
If indicated,
an ultrasound may be performed to further evaluate the
gallbladder and CBD.

3. Multiple hepatic and renal hypodensities most compatible with
simple
cysts.
.
[**3-16**] MR Lumbar/Pelvis:
IMPRESSION:
1. Moderate new free fluid in the pelvis of uncertain etiology.
No evidence of abscess or osteomyelitis.

2. Chronic compression fracture of T12 vertebral body with
minimal
retropulsion as described above.

3. Degenerative changes in the lumbar spine at multiple levels
without
significant spinal canal or neural foraminal narrowing.


Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 61 year old female with PMH of interstitial lung
disease presenting from an OSH for septic shock in the setting
of a PNA.
.
# Septic Shock:  Patient had a fever to 102 on arrival with a
WBC that trended up from 15.2 to 27.2 over the course of 6 hours
since admission.  She was intubated with CT imaging showing
pulmonary findings concerning for infection on top of a chronic
interstitial lung disease.  She was resuscitated with liberal
IVFs and started on vancomycin, Zosyn, and azithromycin which
was tapered to vancomycin and Zosyn after 72 hours for an
intended 8 day course.  She improved dramatically but had no
positive cultures and prolonged hypotension requiring pressors
until [**3-16**].  [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 104**] stim was performed for prolonged hypotension
which was negative.  She was weaned successfully off pressors
and was sat'ing well on room air.
.
# Respiratory Failure:  The patient was intubated at an OSH
prior to arrival here likely secondary to pneumonia on top of
her baseline interstitial lung disease.  She was extubated on
[**3-14**] without difficulty.
.
# Stress cardiomyopathy:  A code STEMI was called on arrival to
ICU as patient had frank ST elevations in I, AVL, and V2.  She
was taken to the cath lab immediately and had clean coronaries.
An ECHO showed evidence of a stress cardiomyopathy (Takotsubo's)
with an EF=40-45%.  Cardiology continued to follow the patient
and a heparin drip was initiated with plan to bridge to
Coumadin. If possible she should be set up with an appointment
with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 696**] of cardiology on a Thursday morning in about a
month and will likely need a repeat ECHO in [**3-3**] months to
reassess her need for Coumadin. For now our planned course of
anticoagulation is a 3 month course.
.
# T12 compression fracture:  Patient has had back pain with
right foot numbness but no motor deficits since the end of
[**2140-12-29**].  She is on oxycodone and Flexeril as an
outpatient but says that she gets minimal relief from these
medications.  An MRI of her lumbar spine and pelvis was
performed and positive only for a chronic compression fracture
of T12.  Spine consult was obtained and recommended pain control
only and no need for surgical intervention or TLSO brace.
