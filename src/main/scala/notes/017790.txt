Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1406**]
Chief Complaint:
shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
left heart catheterization, coronary angiogram, left
ventriculogram
Coronary artery bypass grafting x 4 & Mitral Valve Repair (28mm
Ring) [**2175-4-20**]


History of Present Illness:
This 69 year old gentleman has no past medical history has had
four or five months of dyspnea on exertion. The patient was
noted to be tachycardic with atrial tachycardia with 2:1
conduction at an outpatient visit. He was noted to be in
congestive heart failure. Lisinopril and digoxin were started
(held on beta blocker because he had heart failure). With
digoxin, he had much less dyspnea on exertion. He was noted to
have a LVEF of 10 to 15% with mitral regurgitation.

 Dr.[**Doctor Last Name 3733**] felt his dilated cardiomyopathy was secondary to
tachycardia and underwent cardiac catheterization to evaluate
for coronary disease. this revealed left main disease and mitral
regurgitation. He underwent further evaluation to determine if
he was a good surgical candidate.


Past Medical History:
Dilated cardiomyopathy (LVEF 10-15%)
Severe mitral regurgitation
Atrial arrhythmia

Social History:
The patient lives with his wife. Denies any current smoking,
alcohol

Family History:
There is no family history of premature coronary artery disease
or sudden death.

Physical Exam:
ADMISSION PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
VS - T: 97.7, BP: 103/70, HR: 87, RR: 18, O2 sat: 98%
Gen: Elderly male in NAD. Oriented x3. Mood, affect appropriate.
HEENT: NCAT. Sclera anicteric. PERRL, EOMI. Conjunctiva were
pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa. No xanthalesma.
Neck: Supple. JVP of 7 cm.
CV: PMI located in 5th intercostal space, midclavicular line.
Tachycardia. Regular rate. normal S1, S2. No m/r/g. No thrills,
lifts. No S3 or S4.
Chest: No chest wall deformities, scoliosis or kyphosis. Resp
were unlabored, no accessory muscle use. Limited to anterior
auscultation with crackles at bases. No wheezes or rhonchi.
Abd: Soft, NTND. No HSM or tenderness.
Ext: No c/c/e.
Skin: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
.
Pulses:
Right: Carotid 2+ DP 1+ PT 1+
Left: Carotid 2+ DP 1+ PT 1+

Pertinent Results:
Cardiac MRI: Impression:
1. Severely increased left ventricular (LV) volume and global LV
systolic
dysfunction. The LVEF was severely decreased at 26%. Severe
global
hypokinesis with mild sparing of the LV apex. The effective
forward LVEF was severely decreased at 16%. No CMR evidence of
prior myocardial
scarring/infarction. This pattern of LV dysfunction (global
hypokinesis with apical sparing) and lack of LGE is more
consistent with a non-ischemic
cardiomyopathy. However, if myocardial hibernation due to severe
CAD is the
etiology of this patient's LV dysfunction, these findings are
consistent with high likelihood of functional recovery following
mechanical revascularization.
2. Normal right ventricular cavity size with mild global
systolic dysfunction. The RVEF was mildly decreased at 41%.
3. Severe mitral and tricuspid regurgitation..
4. The indexed diameters of the ascending and descending
thoracic aorta were normal. The main pulmonary artery diameter
index was normal.
5. Moderate left atrial enlargement. Mild right atrial
enlargement
6. Small pericardial effusion.
7. Aortic atheroma.
8. Small, bright signal seen in the liver on scout images which
likely
represents a hepatic cyst.

Brief Hospital Course:
[**4-20**] Mr.[**Known lastname **] was taken to the operating room and underwent
coronary artery bypass  grafting x4 and mitral valve repair.
Please see operative note for details. He tolerated the
procedure well and was transferred to the CVICU in stable but
critical condition, intubated, sedated, on milrinone, and
pressors to optimize cardiac function. He awoke neurologically
intact and was extubated on POD#1 without difficulty. Inotropes
and pressors were weaned off, he was started on diuretics and
carvedilol. Plan to start ACE-I when BP tolerates. His chest
tubes and epicardial pacing wires were removed per protocol. He
was transferred from the ICU on POD#4 for further monitoring.
Physical therapy was consulted for evaluation of strength and
mobility. He continued to progress and was cleared for discharge
to home by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on POD# 6. All follow up appointments were
advised.
