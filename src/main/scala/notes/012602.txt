History of Present Illness:
(per admission CMI note as pt too somnolent to give hx) Mrs.
[**Known lastname 27927**] is a 63yo F with known CAD, prior $ vessel CABG in
'[**10**], who presented to [**Hospital3 3583**] on [**3-30**] with chest pain.
Patient reports that approximately 2 months ago, she began to
notice chest tightness radiating to her left arm, with exertion
and at rest. These symptoms worsened over the past week and she
noticed an increase in palpitations over the past week as well.
She describes the pain as midsternal chest pressure radiating to
her left arm and back. The pain is associated with SOB, mild
dizziness and nausea. She took 2 SL NTG on one occasion which
did relieve her CP. She reported her symptoms to her PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**3-29**]
who instructed her to go to the ED. She was admitted to [**Hospital1 3325**] [**3-30**] and ruled out for an MI by serial enzymes. An ETT
done [**3-31**] depressions and T-wave
flattening. She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] today for cath. On
arrival, she was chest pain free.

CARDIAC CATH [**2117-4-5**]:
COMMENTS:
1. The mid graft lesion was predilated with a 2.0 X 15mm Voyager

baloon at 6 atm and under distal filter protection, we then
deployed a
3.5 X 18mm Cypher stent at 10 atm.
2. The proximal graft lesion directly stented with a 3.5 X 23 mm
Cypher
stent at 14 atm and post dilated using a 3.5 X15mm Power sail
balloon at
16 atm, twice. the final angiogram showed TIMI III flow with no
residual
stenosis in the mid graft stent, 10% residual stenosis in the
proximal
graft stent with no dissection and no embolisation. The patient
left the
lab in a stable conditio. (see PTCA comments)
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Successful stenting of the mid SVG (to LAD) lesion
2. Successful stenting of the proxsimal SVG (to LAD) lesion




Brief Hospital Course:
Patient is a 63 year old female with known CAD, initally
presented to outside hospital with chest pain.
.
At the outside hospital, patient was ruled out for an MI with 3
sets of negative cardiac enzymes, had a positive ETT, and was
subsequently transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for cardiac catheterization.
.
At [**Hospital1 18**], patient initally underwent cardiac catheterization
where she was found to have a 90% mid lesion and a 60% proximal
lesion of the SVG to LAD graft had and a 60% distal lesion and a
50% proximal lesion of the SVG to OM. She had 2 Cypher stents
placed in the SVG to OM lesion, with plans to return to the cath
lab for stenting of the SVG to LAD lesion.  Her first post-cath
course was complicated by severe nausea and vomiting which was
eventually relieved with antiemetic medication.  Due to her GI
upset, she was also started on protonix, which helped to
alleviate her symptoms, and had H. Pylori test sent which was
negative.  Otherwise, her Cr, CPK, and EKG remained normal
post-cath.  Prior to return for her 2nd catheterization, the
patient underwent pre-medication with famotidine, benadryl, and
solumedrol (in case her post-cath nausea/vomiting was secondary
to dye allergy), and received only versed (no fentanyl) for
sedation peri-cath.  In her second cardiac catheterization,
patient had 2 Cypher stents placed in the SVG to LAD lesion.
This post-cath course was not complicated by nausea/vomiting,
and again, her CPK, Cr and EKG remained normal post-cath.
.
The patient was otherwise managed medically, continuing her
outpatient anti-hypertensive medications (imdur, which was
decreased from 30mg [**Hospital1 **] to 30mg QD due to low blood pressures,
diltiazem, and quinapril).  She was also maintained on aspirin
325mg QD, was started on Plavix 75mg QD.
.
The [**Hospital 228**] hospital course was also notable for some
hematuria which developed following foley catheter placement,
and was thought to be secondary to traumatic foley placement.  A
urine culture was sent which was negative, and her hematocrit
remained stable and the hematuria resolved upon removal of the
foley catheter.
.
The patient was discharged on her outpatient medication regimen
(although her aspirin dose was increased to full strength and
her imdur was decreased to daily), along with new medications
including plavix and protonix.  She was discharged with
appointments to follow up with both her primary care physician
and her cardiologist within the next couple weeks.
