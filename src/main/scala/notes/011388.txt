Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Atenolol / Lisinopril

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3151**]
Chief Complaint:
Dysphagia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
1. EGD x2 on [**2162-3-20**]
2. Intubation on [**2162-3-20**] for airway protection. She was
successfuly extubated on [**3-21**].

History of Present Illness:
89 year old woman with PMH significant for HTN and
hypothyroidism who presented with dysphagia and odynophagia on
[**3-20**]. At that tiem, she was eating [**Country 1073**] off of the bone when
she felt a sudden onset of substernal chest pain with some
radiation to the left and right chest, the epigastrium and the
neck/shoulder.  She did not have any nausea, vomiting, SOB or
back pain.  She has otherwise been feeling well and has not had
any decreased exercise tolerance. She walks 40-50 steps a day
without difficulty.

On arrival at the hospital, the pt unable to swallow liquids or
solids. In addition, she was spitting up pieces of [**Country 1073**]. GI
was consulted. An initial EGD showed [**Country 1073**] and other food from
20 to 40 cm in the esophagus. It was felt that this could not be
safely removed without airway protection. Therefore, the pt was
intubated by anesthesia and then the EGD was repeated. During
this procedure, the food was partially removed using a basket
and the rest was pushed into the stomach. A sticture was
visualized at 34 cm which did not appear to be malignant. In
addition, there was a small hiatal hernia, esophagitis in the
distal esophagus, and erythema in the stomach consistent with
gastritis. The pt tolerated the procedure well then developed a
fever to 101.2 on [**3-21**]. At that time, there was concern for
perforation from the EGDs but no free air or other abnormality
was visualized on CXR or CT scan. However, the pt was started on
antibiotics given the continued concern for microperforation.
Blood cultures have been negative to date. She was successfuly
extubated on [**3-21**] and is now ready for transfer to the floor.

CXR
IMPRESSION:
1) No acute cardiopulmonary process.
2) Air fluid level in the esophagus, suggesting the possibility
of acute food bolus impaction.

EGD
Food bolus with [**Country 1073**] in the entire esophagus from 20-40cm.

Repeat EGD
Food in the 20cm to the GE junction.  Small hiatal hernia.
Stricture of the 34cm.  Erythema in stomach c/w gastritis.
Esophagitis in the distal esophagus and in the hiatal hernia.
.
Barium swallow: Barium passes freely through the esophagus.
There are normal stripping waves. No hiatal hernia or
gastroesophageal reflux is demonstrated. The stomach distends
and empties normally and no abnormality is detected within the
stomach. The duodenal bulb, loop and visualized proximal small
bowel are normal.
.
CT chest:
1. No mediastinal free air.
2. Several bilateral subcentimeter pulmonary nodules, likely
benign.
3. Irregular parenchymal scarring at the right lung apex. This
is not clearly benign, and short term follow up at 3 months is
recommended.
4. Left adrenal adenoma.
5. Biliary ductal dilatation with suggestion of several punctate
higher density foci within the lumen distally. This is
incompletely evaluated, but raises the possibility of
choledocholithiasis. Clinical correlation is recommended and
further evaluation with ERCP or MRCP should be considered.


Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 89F with chest pain secondary to food bolus impaction
within the esophagus, admitted to the MICU briefly because of
intubation for airway protection during removal of the food,
then extubated without difficulty. EGD revealed a stricture but
the patient then had a normal barium swallow.
.
1. Food impaction within the esophagus.
- As a stricture was seen on EGD but no abnormalities were
appreciated on barium swallow, the cause of the patient's food
impaction within the esophagus remains unclear. The ddx includes
stricture not visualized on this particular barium swallow, vs.
esophageal spasm or dysmotility.
- It was confirmed with radiology that there was no stricture,
no esophageal trauma, and no ulceration seen on barium swallow.
.
- After discussion with the GI team, it was decided that given
the significant inflammation seen on EGD, the patient will need
a repeat endoscopy when inflammation subsides in [**1-7**] weeks, and
should f/u with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 7307**] in clinic. She may also need
esophageal dysmotility studies at that time as well.
.
- During her hospitalization, the patient was intially placed
solely on clears for several days. Her diet was gradually
advanced to puree consistency. At one point, she was noted to be
coughing [**Location (un) 2452**] sputum a short time after eating [**Location (un) 2452**] jello,
and there was concern for oropharyngeal dysphagia in addition to
esophageal problems; however, a speech and swallow was done
which was negative. On discharge, she was visited by the
nutrition service, who recommended foods that she could eat and
advocated the blenderized diet. The patient's son was
recommended to set up an appointment in the [**Hospital1 **] nutrition clinic,
as it is unclear how long the patient will have to be on a puree
diet.
.
- She was continued on a [**Hospital1 **] PPI for gastritis and esophagitis
seen on EGD, and discharged on this as well.
.
2. Fever and mildly decreased O2 sat. The initial ddx included
PNA (aspiration) and microperforation of the esophagus. CXR from
[**3-23**] showed no infiltrate but did show volume overload.
Regarding microperforation, there was no sign of free air by
chest or neck CT's, or by barium swallow. All cultures were
negative at the time of discharge.
- Continued levo/flagyl for one week, for possible aspiration
PNA not seen on CXR.
.
3. Blood pressure
- The patient was hypotensive to SBP 90's on admission, which
resolved with fluid boluses. BP was 130's - 160's after fluid
resuscitation but during the patient's episode of chest pressure
on [**3-21**], increased to 200/90. At that time her beta blocker dose
was increased, which she tolerated well.
- Continued nifedipine, cozaar, and toprol (at an increased dose
for BP control).
.
4. On [**3-21**], the patient had an episode of chest pressure [**2-11**],
across the chest. She complained of the chest pressure only
after walking with PT, but per her report had had it for hours
without change (and it was no worse with walking). No SOB, no
abd pain. No worse with coughing or deep breaths. She attributed
the "funny feeling" to indigestion. BP was noted to be 200/90,
pulse 90's. An EKG done showing new T wave depressions in V2
(isolated) and slightly dee
