Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4588**]
Chief Complaint:
Fall

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
87 year old woman with history of hypertension, coronary artery
disease, mild systolic heart failure, severe aortic stenosis,
mitral regurgitation, osteoporosis (with h/o compression
fractures) presenting from [**Hospital 100**] Rehab nursing home after an
unwitnessed fall in the bathroom without loc.
Briefly, the patient was initially admitted to the trauma
service for suspected cervical neck injury. Trauma series
revealed a non displaced, left patellar fracture and a C7
compression fracture. Patient however was found to be
hypotensive and cardiac ezymes were checked and revealed a
rapidly raising trend. She was transferred to the medical
service for further management.
In the medical floor, the patient was found to have systolic
pressures in the 90's, which decreased further to 80's. Patient
was given two 250ml boluses with little response in hypotension,
at this time request for MICU transfer was made.

Pertinent Results:
ECG:
[**2123-7-15**] 16:45
Sinus rhythm at 86, with very late R wave progression, axis with
mild leftward deviation and 1mm ST elevations in leads III and
aVF as well as AvR and V1-V2, with 1-2mm concave ST depressions
on I, aVL. Diffuse T-wave flattening. Q waves noted on II and
aVF, more prominent than in [**2119**].

[**2123-7-16**] 17:49
Sinur rhythm at 68, with very late R wave progression, new
T-wave inversion along III, aVF and flat at II. 1mm ST
depression at I and aVL, with q waves in III and aVF.

Relevant Imaging:
KNEE X-RAY ([**2123-7-15**]): Nondisplaced-nondistracted transverse
fracture through the patella as above.

L SPINE X-RAY ([**7-15**]):Nearly nondiagnostic study. There are
multiple compression type deformities throughout the lumbar
spine and at least two in the mid and lower thoracic spine.
Levels are difficult to discern, but approximately in the region
of T5, T6 and T10, T11 and likewise possibly involving L1, L3
and L4. The acuity of these fractures is unknown. Posterior
retropulsion is unknown.

CHEST X-RAY  ([**7-15**]): Bibasilar atelectasis. No evidence of
pneumonia or congestive heart failure.

CT Head ([**7-15**]): No acute intracranial hemorrhage.

CT C-SPINE ([**7-15**]): Several levels of spondylolisthesis and
anterior wedging of the C7 vertebral body. While these findings
may be chronic, in the setting of trauma, an acute injury cannot
be excluded, and if concern remains for injury to the cervical
spine, an MRI is recommended.

CT T-SPINE ([**7-15**]): Anterior wedging of the C7 vertebral body of
indeterminate age. Mild wedge deformities of other thoracic
vertebral bodies as described. No spondylolisthesis.

CT L SPINE ([**7-15**]): Compression deformities involving the L2 and
L3 vertebral bodies. Mild, grade 1 anterolisthesis of the L4-5
level.

KNEE X-RAY ([**7-15**]): Deformity of the patella is likely chronic,
given history of remote fracture. No acute fracture.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname **] is a 87 year old woman with CHF, aortic stenosis,
HTN, CAD admitted for right patellar fracture and acute versus
chronic C7 compression fracture with a hospital course
complicated by hypotension, troponin leak, and constipation.

1. C7 Compression fracture: Patient was diagnosed with a acute
versus chronic C7 compression fracture.  Neurosurgery was
evaluated and did not consider the patient a surgical candidate.
 She was instructed to wear a soft cervical collar and to
follow-up with outpatient neurosurgery in 4 weeks.

2. Patellar fracture: Per orthopedics, patellar fracture of
acute versus chronic nature.  She was evaluated by orthopedic
trauma, which did not feel that she was a surgical candidate.
Conservative management was recommended with a knee brace and
limited mobility.  She will need to follow-up with outpatient
ortho clinic at [**Hospital 100**] Rehab in 1 week.

3. Aortic stenosis: Patient has severe aortic stenosis. She was
evaluated by cardiology, who do not feel that she is currently a
surgical candidate.  She was instructed to follow-up with
cardiology as an outpatient.

4. Foley catheter: On admission, patient had a dirty urinalysis
that, when repeated, was clean.  Both urine cultures ([**7-16**], [**7-18**])
speciated as Corynebacterium species.  The patient also failed
two voiding trials during hospitalization, and thus was
discharged with a foley catheter.  A urinalysis and urine
culture was sent on the day of discharge that will need to be
followed up on.

5. Elevated cardiac enzymes: Patient initially had elevated
troponins up to 0.77 with flat MBI.  She was evaluated by
cardiology, which felt that the troponin leak was secondary to
demand ischemia.

6. Hypotension: Patient presented with transient hypotension
likely secondary to hypovolemia. An occult bleed was also on the
differential given her drop in hematocrit. Her blood pressure
quickly normalized after receiving several fluid boluses and a
transfusion of 2 units PRBC. There were no signs of an
infection.  She was normotensive in the MICU and remained so
upon transfer to the general medicine floor.  Home lisinopril
was restarted on discharge.

7. Anemia: Patient presented with acute Hct drop during her
hospital stay. She received 2 units pRBCs with an appropriate
bump. Etiology to the patient anemia is currently unknown.
Patient was guaiac positive during this admission, which may
require further outpatient evaluation.  On discharge, patient's
hematocrit was stable.

8. Systolic heart failure: Patient does not seem significantly
volume overloaded on physical exam. Diuretics and
anti-hypertensives were being held in light of her hypotension.
Lisinopril was restarted on discharge. As the patient was
euvolemic on discharge, lasix was not restarted.

9. Constipation: Patient had severe constipation secondary to
opiod analgesia during hospital admission requing laxative,
enema, and manual disimpaction.  On the day of discharge, she
had a large bowel movement with symptomatic relief.  Patient was
discharged with bowel regimen including colace and senokot.  As
she was complaining of some mild abdominal discomfort/gassiness,
she was also discharged with PRN maalox.

10. Conjunctivitis: Patient was started on Ciprofloxacin eye
drops for 7 day course (stop on [**7-25**]).

11. Hyperlipidemia: On admission, the patient was noted in her
paperwork to be on zocor, which was being held for 14 days.  Her
statin therapy was held on admission and at discharge, and
should be restarted as an outpatient by her PCP.

12. Electrolyte repletion: Patient's serum phosphate level the
morning of discharge was low at 1.9 mg/dL.  She refused oral
repletion with neutra-phos, and will need to be repleted.

13. Prophylaxis: Patient received heparin SQ for DVT prophylaxis
during her hospital stay.
