Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1936**]
Chief Complaint:
respiratory distress

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 13260**] is a [**Age over 90 **] year old Chinese speaking lady, baseline
non-verbal, non-moving, current resident of [**Location **] Health has
been experiencing increasing work of breathing per her family.
Per her daughter (via translator) she has been experiencing
increasing work of breathing with a low growl that is not
typical. While at the nursing home, she was administered nebs
per report which were not effective. Despite receiving all of
her regular care at [**Hospital1 3278**] (recently discharged [**10/2111**]), EMS
brought her to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation.
.
In the ED, vital signs were initially: T: 97.7, HR:108 BP:
154/84 RR: 26 O2 sat:100% @ room air. Pt appeared uncomfortable
with paroxysms of redness and difficulty breathing. She was
started on Levofloxacin for HCAP, but after her IV infiltrated,
she was changed to Vanc/CTX/Azithro. Nebs did provide some
relief. ASA given for elevated troponin. The patient was
admitted to the MICU for respiratory distress.
.
On arrival to the MICU, the patient was non-verbal and had a low
growling sound when examined. In the MICU, the patient was
treated with nebulizers. ENT evaluated her and did not see any
upper airway obstruction, though they could not exclude the
lower respiratory tract. She had a CT of the chest which did not
show pneumonia. Since she has a firm abdomen, she had a CT of
the abdomen and pelvis. For unknown reasons, the patient had an
elevated lactate to 4.0. On telemetry, the patient was having
short intervals of sinus tachycardia to 120.
.
Per Family/recordS: no fevers, chills, weight loss (Actually
report weight gain), vomiting, diarrhea, melena, pruritis.
+ Constipation

Past Medical History:
- Hip fx after fall in [**2109**] with L hip replacement, subsequent
dislocation
- 3 subsequent CVAs leaving her non-verbal and with very limited
function. Unsure of territories.
- G tube placement ~ [**2109**]
- paroxysmal atrial fibrillation

Social History:
Lives at [**Location **] Health, Chinese Speaking, non verbal at
baseline. Prior to [**2109**] fall/fx/strokes, patient was at home and
independent.

Family History:
Non-contributory

-------------------
Imaging:

CT head ([**2-16**]): IMPRESSION: Extensive hypodensity involving the
right frontal, parietal, and temporal lobes consistent with
large vascular territory infarct. No shift of normally midline
structures. MRI is recommended for further evaluation.

CT abd/pelvis ([**2-16**]): IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of free air or free fluid in the abdomen and
pelvis.
2. Left superior posterior hip dislocation.
3. Bilateral moderate pleural effusions.

CT chest ([**2-17**]):
CT CHEST WITHOUT CONTRAST: The study is limited by insufficient
inspiratory effort and motion artifacts. Allowing for the
limitations, there are mild-to-moderate bilateral pleural
effusions, with associated bibasilar relaxation atelectasis. The
lungs are grossly symmetric in size. Assessment of the pulmonary
parenchyma is markedly limited. Nonspecific ground-glass and
consolidative opacities are likely secondary to bronchovascular
crowding but infectious etiology cannot be excluded. There is no
pneumothorax.

The trachea is tortuous with a moderate right-sided buckle. The
bilateral
main bronchial diameter is moderately diminished, measuring
approximately 3 mm on the right and 4 mm on the left. The
descending aorta is also tortuous with vascular calcification
most severe along the aortic arch. The heart is normal in size,
and without pericardial effusion. There is coronary artery
calcification. The remaining great mediastinal vessels are
within normal limits. There is no mediastinal, hilar, or
axillary lymphadenopathy. The esophagus is also tortuous.

The study is not designed for subdiaphragmatic diagnosis.
Retained oral contrast is seen in the visualized loops of bowel
from the CT abdomen study yesterday.

BONE WINDOWS: No suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesion is noted.
There are
mild-to-moderate multilevel degenerative changes.

IMPRESSION:
1. Limited exam. No evidence of aspirated object.
2. Tortuous trachea, with moderately diminished caliber of the
bilateral main bronchi, concerning for tracheobronchomalacia.
3. Bilateral small-to-moderate pleural effusions with associated
atelectasis. Infection cannot be excluded.
4. Tortuous descending aorta and tortuous esophagus.

Brief Hospital Course:
Summary: [**Age over 90 **] year old lady with respiratory decline for three
days who initially presented to the MICU and transferred to the
floors.

Assessment/Plan

# Tracheobronchomalacia causing wheezing: This finding was seen
on CT scan. There was concern for upper airway obstruction, but
no foreign object or edema seen on ENT scope exam. There was no
PNA on CXR but she did have bilateral pleural effusions and very
mild pulmonary edema. She recieved a couple doses of broad Abx
but this was stopped as low concern for PNA (no fever,
leukocytosis). She was given a couple doses of IV lasix 10mg
with -1.5L diuresis total with mild improvement (note from [**Hospital1 59979**], Echo [**9-30**] showed normal LVEF 55%, no DD). In
addition, she was found to have episodes of Afib RVR while here
so she may have mild dCHF leading to her effusions. We suspect
she may have had a viral syndrome leading to reactive airways in
setting TBM. There was no foriegn object in her lower airways.
She will be treated with 5days of prednisone 40mg and nebs q3
ATC. By day of discharge (after steroids and gentle diuresis),
her breathing was much improved and she no longer appeared in
distress. She will continue nebulizers until her wheezing
resolves.
.
Acute exacerbation of diastolic heart failure: The patient was
noted to have pulmonary edema, however recent echo from [**9-30**]
showed no diastolic or systolic dysfunction. The patient most
likely episodes of atrial fibrillation with RVR which caused
fluid to be retained in her
