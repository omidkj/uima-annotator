CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Shortness of breath

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 60-year-old female
with a history of severe chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease.  Her last FEV1 was 32% of predicted.  The patient
has a history of frequent Emergency Room visits and
hospitalizations for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
flares.  In the past, she has also been labelled as having
severe persistent asthma, although there has never been any
documented reversibility of her airway obstruction with beta
agonist.

The patient was apparently doing well until approximately 11
a.m. on the day of admission when she noted worsening cough
and increased shortness of breath refractory to multiple uses
of her inhaler.  She came to the Emergency Room where
initially she was found to have an unmeasurable peak flow.
She received albuterol and Atrovent nebulizers x3 with no
improvement.  She was placed on a continuous albuterol
nebulizer and subsequently had an arterial blood gases drawn
which showed a pH of 7.17, PCO2 of 74, PO2 of 79.

The patient was subsequently placed heliox because apparently
on a previous hospitalization it resulted in improvement in
her symptoms.  Although the patient stated she felt slightly
more comfortable on the heliox, her arterial blood gases
remained unchanged at 7.17, PCO2 of 73, PO2 of 86.  She was
admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for further
management.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.  The
patient's last formal pulmonary function tests were in [**2180**]
showing an FEV1 of 0.67 liters which is 32% of predicted with
no improvement after beta agonist.  Her FVC was 1.47 liters
which is 53% of predicted and her FEV1 to FVC ratio is 45
which is 74% of predicted.
2.  Osteoporosis
3.  Status post bilateral total hip replacement

ADMISSION MEDICATIONS;
1.  Flovent 2 puffs inhaled [**Hospital1 **]
2.  Albuterol inhaler 2 puffs qid prn
3.  Atrovent 2 puffs qid
4.  Calcium carbonate 500 mg q day
5.  Vitamin D 400 units once a day
6.  Serevent inhaler 2 puffs inhaled [**Hospital1 **]
7.  Neurontin 300 mg po tid

ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives by herself.  She has to
climb 72 stairs to get to her apartment.  She continues to
smoke a half pack per day of cigarettes and occasionally
drinks alcohol.

ADMISSION PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
VITAL SIGNS:  The patient was afebrile.  Pulse was 129,
respiratory rate 30, blood pressure 147/41, oxygen saturation
99% on 30% oxygen.
GENERAL:  She was tachypneic, but able to speak in full
sentence and moderate respiratory distress.
HEAD, EARS, EYES, NOSE AND THROAT:  Sclerae were anicteric.
Her oropharynx was moist.  Neck was supple with no jugular
venous distention and no lymphadenopathy.
HEART:  Tachycardic with no murmurs.
LUNGS:  Significant for very poor air exchange, but no
audible wheezes.
ABDOMEN:  Soft, nontender, with normoactive bowel sounds.
EXTREMITIES:  There was no peripheral edema.

LABS:  CBC on admission showed a white count of 6.9,
hematocrit of 42.3, platelets of 186.  Chem-7 significant for
sodium 142, potassium 4.2, chloride 103, bicarbonate 22, BUN
24, creatinine 1.1, glucose of 173.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  After admission to the Medical Intensive
Care Unit because of her failure to improve on heliox, she
was eventually placed on BIPAP with 12 of inspiratory
pressure support and 5 PEEP.  The patient did quite well on
this regimen and her arterial blood gases improved to pH of
7.2, PCO2 59, PO2 of 81.  The patient was also started on
high dose Solu-Medrol and continued to receive intermittent
albuterol and Atrovent nebulizer treatments.  The following
morning, the patient reported that her respiratory status had
improved.  She requested to come off BIPAP and remained on 4
liters by nasal cannula throughout the course of the day.

The patient was gradually transitioned from intermittent
nebulizer treatments to metered dose inhalers and her
intravenous Solu-Medrol was changed to po prednisone.  The
patient continued to have an oxygen requirement of 4 to 6
liters to maintain an oxygen saturation of greater than 90%
and was noted to desaturate into the 80s when coming off
oxygen.

Because of the patient's very tenuous pulmonary status and
her ongoing oxygen requirement, as well as her difficult
living situation and severe respiratory problems, it was
decided appropriate to screen her for pulmonary
rehabilitation.  The patient had a repeat chest x-ray prior
to departing.  She was noted to have a small right upper zone
infiltrate and it was decided to treat the patient
presumptively for possible pneumonia for a 10 day course.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Levaquin 250 mg po qd for 10 days
2.  Prednisone 40 mg a day, to be tapered down gradually by
10 mg every two days to be off by day #8
3.  Protonix 40 mg po qd until the prednisone is finished
4.  Albuterol and Atrovent metered dose inhalers.  Albuterol
inhaler 2 puffs inhaled q4h and q2h prn.  Atrovent 2 puffs
inhaled q4h and q2h prn.
5.  Nicoderm patch 14 mg topically q day
6.  Neurontin 300 mg po tid
7.  Calcium carbonate 500 mg po qd
8.  Vitamin D 400 international units po qd

The patient is also discharged on oxygen by nasal cannula to
maintain an oxygen saturation greater than 90%.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation,
secondary to problem #2.
2.  Right sided pneumonia
3.  New small right upper zone nodule noted on chest x-ray
which is to be followed up as an outpatient.
