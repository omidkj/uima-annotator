Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 348**]
Chief Complaint:
SOB

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Tracheostomy tube placement
PICC line placement


History of Present Illness:
81yo F s/p L knee replacement with a prolonged post-op course
notable for respiratory failure and tracheostomy, transferred
from an OSH with shortness of breath and stridor after
bronchoscopy revealed 80-90% subglottic stenosis.
.
The patient was initially hospitalized at [**Hospital 48910**] Hospital on
[**2192-8-9**] for left total knee replacement. The patient was
treated with a morphine PCA post-op until the morning of
[**2192-8-10**] when she was found at 1:30AM to be unresponsive with
agonal breathing after given a percocet. She was hypotensive at
that time ot 62/43. She was found to be in a juncitonal
bradycardia with a HR 30-40. The patient was intubated and
received atropine, epinephrine and narcan. She was placed on a
levophed drip. After 1mg atropine x2 the patient's HR improved
to 50-60 and her sbp improved to 140. She was transferred to St.
[**Hospital 6783**] Hospital MICU.
.
The patient stayed at [**Hospital2 **] [**Hospital3 6783**] hospital from
07.21.07-08.26.07. At [**Hospital2 **] [**Hospital3 6783**], the paitnet had a
non-contrast head CT negative for an intracranial abnormality.
MRI on [**2192-8-15**] revealed small, acute cortical infarcts in the
right medial temporal lobe and non-acute left bifrontal lobe
infarcts. There was also diffuse distal intrasclerotic disease
in the middle cerebral artery and posterior cerebral artery
territory. EEG was negative for epileptogenic activity.
.
Due to junctional escape rhytms on EKG with low-voltage diffuse
T-wave flattening and inversions and a troponin elevation (to
1.1) and CPK (to 346 with normal MB) she underwent cardiac
catheterization. Cardiac cath on [**2192-8-13**] revealed 3 vessel CAD
with an EF 53%. She remained in sinus rhythm after cardiac cath
and did not undergo pacer placement. She was started on
beta-blocker, ACEi and aspirin at this time.
.
The patient failed weaning trials. She was given stress dose
steroids without success. She was also treated for a VAP (MRSA)
with vancomycin. She underwent tracheostomy on [**2192-8-29**]. She was
unable ot tolerate the Passey-Muir valve. There was no
granulomatous tissue or stenosis noted at that time. The patient
self-decannulated on [**2192-9-14**]. At that time a #6 fenestrated
cuff was immediately replaced.
.
The patient failed speech and swallow x2 and underwent PEG
placement on [**2192-9-13**]. She was receiving Jevity 1.2 with a goal
of 55cc/hr.
.
The patient had further complications of persistent fever
spikes. She was treated with Cefepime x7 days for E. Coli and
Klebsiella UTI. She also had an episode of coffee-ground emesis
and was started on a PPI. She had waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] mental
status of unclear etiology (toxic-metabolic vs. primary
psychiatric) and it is unclear what her mental status was at the
time of discharge to [**Hospital3 **]. The patient again
self-decannulated upon admission to [**Hospital3 **]. Prior to
admission to [**Hospital1 18**], the patient was tolerating trach mask 35%
FiO2.
.
The patient was noted to have stridor and shortness of breath in
the past several days. OSH bronchoscopy revealed an 80-90%
subglottic stenosis. She was transferred for rigid bronchoscopy,
debridement and T tube placement. In the ED, 96.7 96 124/55 18
98% RA.
.
ROS: Denies pain. Endorses shortness of breath as at baseline.

Past Medical History:
Respiratory failure s/p tracheostomy, self-decannualated twice

Brief Hospital Course:
81yo F s/p L knee replacement with a prolonged post-op course
notable for respiratory failure and tracheostomy, transferred
from an OSH with shortness of breath and stridor after
bronchoscopy revealed 80-90% subglottic stenosis.
.
1. Respiratory failure s/p trach complicated by
self-decannulation and subglottic stenosis:
Patient underwent a T-tube placement by interventional pulmonary
team. She initially did not tolerate capping procedure and
repeat bronchoscopy demonstrated clotting of the proximal limb
of the T tube. Interventional pulmonary then removed her T tube
and had a tracheal tube placement. Given that patient is
oxygenating solely through the trach tube, she should never be
capped. She was maintained on nebulizer treatments during her
admission. She will need follow-up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) **] (phone
[**Telephone/Fax (1) 3020**]) in [**6-29**] weeks from discharge from hospital.
.
2. Acute Renal Failure
During this admission, she had elevated creatinine from .7 to
1.3, thought likely secondary to prerenal. Her creatinine
improved with an IVF bolus and holding ACEI and lasix.
.
3. CAD. S/p recent cath with 3-vessel CAD:
She was maintained on aspirin and her statin. She was restarted
gradually on her ACEI and diuretic during her admission. She was
started back on metoprolol 12.5 [**Hospital1 **] at discharge.
.
4. Recent coffee-ground emesis:
She had an episode of recent coffee ground emesis which was
thought to represent a stress-induced ulcer. She was started on
PPI [**Hospital1 **]. Patient should likely have an EGD upon discharge.
.
# UE DVT: Now on warfarin and enoxaparin bridge. INR at
discharge was 1.2
.
5. S/p total left knee replacement:
She was continued on heparin SC for DVT prophylaxis. She was
maintained on her home pain regimen of lidoderm patch, [**Hospital1 21330**],
and tylenol PRN.She will likely need PT/OT upon discharge.
.
6. MRSA VAP/Bacteremia:
The patient was receiving vancomycin for MRSA and VAP
bacteremia. In discussion with physicians at rehab, patient was
to complete her vancomycin course on [**2192-11-8**].
.
7. Anemia:
Her hematocrit was stable from recent hospitalization, although
it slowly trended downward since admission. She was maintained
on her iron supplementation from home.
- Guaiac all stools.
.
8. Bipolar disorder. During recent hospitalization, psych
consult recommended restarting home Lithium, though this was not
done in accordance with family wishes. She was continued on her
lamictal, risperidone, and prn ativan, according to her home
regimen.
