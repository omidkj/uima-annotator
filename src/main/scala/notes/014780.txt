Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1711**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of Breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
defibrillation

History of Present Illness:
34 yo woman with h/o hypertrophic CMY, multifocal atrial
tachycardias s/p failed PVI [**3-21**], c/b pericardial tamponade c
window c/b PEA arrest x 45 minutes [**3-21**] with temporary CVVHD,
and recent admission for SOB, treated for volume overload, who
was admitted with chief complaint of shortness of breath and
chest pain. Initial vitals in ED showed T 97, HR 55, BP 124/66,
RR 19, with o2 sat 100% on 4L. Pt. being evaluated by resident
in ED, denying CP, when she acutely c/o dyspnea and was noted to
have wide complex rhythm on tele and lost pulse. Given 2 rds
epi, 1 rd atropine, 2 rds bicarb/ca chloride/insulin/D50 for
presumed hyperkalemia as initial EKG showed sine wave pattern.
Also given 2L IVFs. She was coded for 30 minutes after which she
regained pulse and EKG showed NSR with wide complex with RBBB.
Initial BP 202/68. She then developed wide complex ventricular
tachycardia with BP 68/p, for which she was defibrillated X 1
200J and started on dopamine. At that point, she returned to NSR
and was quickly weaned off dopamine gtt.
.
She had non-sterile R femoral line placed for access. Initial
labs (during code) showed K 5.5 on ABG (unclear if before or
after tx. for hyperkalemia) with ABG of 6.92/63/50. Bedside TTE
without pericardial effusion. CXR showed new R>L pleural
effusions, and given difficulty of oxygenating, R Chest tube
placed with estimated 200cc out. She was transiently placed on
dopamine gtt for hypotension s/p code, but quickly SBPs returned
and dopamine weaned.
.
Per patient care referral, pt. c/o nausea and pain at 8:30 this
AM, with SOB, lethargy, diaphoresis. Per initial nursing note in
[**Name (NI) **], pt. also reports diarrhea, nausea, abdominal pain over last
few days. EKG showed sinus bradycardia, with RBBB. Pt. reported
to weigh 192.9 lbs, which is [**2-12**] lb. decrease from admission.
Vitals were significant for no fever, BP 80s-100s/50s-70s,
satting 100% on 2L. Pt. with cold extremities, so was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].


Past Medical History:
# Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.
- Cardiac MR on [**2121-2-28**] with asymmetric LVH with maximal wall
thickness of 19mm at mid septum with focal hyperenhancement
consistent with hypertrophic CM. EF 55%.
# SVT with A fib, left atrial tach and AVNRT s/p pulmonary vein
isolation on [**2121-3-18**].
# Questionable history of WPW
# Tobacco use with bronchitis and associated multifocal a tach.

# Anxiety
# Obesity
# Asthma, ?COPD

Cardiac History:
The patient initially presented with syncope at age of l2. At
l3, the patient was seen at [**Hospital3 1810**] for history of
syncope, chest pain and progressive exercise intolerance. She
was found to have hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. She was
subsequently cathed. Left ventricular end diastolic pressure was
found to be 20. She was then started on chronic Verapamil
therapy. At age l6, she experienced cardiac arrest secondary to
complex tachycardia. She was successfully resuscitated. Repeat
catheterization showed left ventricular end diastolic pressure
of 36-40 without outflow tract obstruction. EP showed inducible
atrial flutter with a rapid ventricular blood pressure. She was
felt to have a rapid antegrade conduction and possible
pre-excitation. She was started on Norpace. Since then, the
patient has been stable on Verapamil and Norpace with occasional
palpitations, chest pain and light headedness.

Social History:
Currently on disability. 40 pack-year smoker (2ppd x20 years)
quit since recent bronchitis. No EtOH. Regular marijuana use.


Family History:
Family history remarkable for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and
congenital aortic stenosis s/p cardiac surgery during infancy.
No family history of sudden cardiac death or premature CAD.
