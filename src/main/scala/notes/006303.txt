Date of Birth:  [**2135-2-12**]             Sex:   F

Service: CARDIOTHORACIC

Allergies:
Zestril

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5790**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of Breath on exertion

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2188-2-11**] Pericardectomy


History of Present Illness:
52 year old woman wiht history of HTN and depression, with known

pericardial effusion and pericardial constriction attributed to
an antecedant viral illness, who reports worsening exercise
tolerance and LE edema (Rt. greater than Lt.) since [**Holiday **].
She had previously been evaluated on the CMI service for
elective RHC on [**12-17**]. Catheterization at that time showed
moderate diastolic left and right ventricular dysfunction and
constrictive physiology.
Shortly after her cardiac catherization she developed R leg pain

and noted an increase in swelling of the both legs but right
greater than left. She also noted that her dyspnea on exertion
also worsened shortly after her catherization.
.
Pericardial effusion attributed to viral illness as follows:
.
Diagnosed initially in [**2187-8-30**] after what was
described as "the flu" (note: there was no antecedent travel,
tick bite) - this was likely a viral URI or other, but very
unlikely to have been influenza per se given timing. She had a
negative PPD and CXR, negative [**Doctor First Name **] and ?negative RF. She did
well until [**12-12**] per pt when she was started on lasix w/o
effect. She then underwent RHC on [**2187-12-19**].

She went to her outpatient cardiologist (Dr.[**Last Name (STitle) 11493**]) Wed [**12-24**],
complaining of the above noted, worsening LE edema and SOB etc.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 11493**] [**Name (NI) 653**] Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] of cardiac surgery here who
asked for her to be admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 196**] for evaluation for surgery
(pericardial stripping).


Past Medical History:
PMH/PSH: pericardial effusion/pericarditis ([**1-4**] TTE: EF55%,
small effusion; [**1-4**] cath: CI 1.9, no coronary dz; OSH workup
for SLE/TB negative, presumed viral etiology), [**12-2**] PE in
RUL/RML/LUL, Bilateral DVTs, depression, HTN


Social History:
Lives w/ husband. Denies substance use, tob, etoh.


Family History:

normal pressure hydrocephalus. Father also had a DVT in the
setting of decreased mobility.

Pertinent Results:
CARDIOLOGY:
[**2188-2-7**] Echo:
1. The left atrium is mildly dilated.
2. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left
ventricular systolic function cannot be reliably assessed.
3. There is a trivial pericardial effusion.
4. Compared with the findings of the prior study (images
reviewed) of [**2188-1-1**], the estimated pulmonary artery pressure has
decreased.

[**2188-2-15**] Echo:
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity is unusually small. Due to suboptimal
technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be
fully excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
low normal (LVEF 50-55%). The right ventricular cavity is
dilated. There is severe global right ventricular free wall
hypokinesis. There is abnormal septal motion/position consistent
with right ventricular pressure/volume overload. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is a small posterior
pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2187-2-7**], the
right ventricle is now markedly dilated and hypokinetic and the
left ventricular cavity is now small.

RADIOLOGY:

[**2188-2-6**] CXR: The bilateral pleural effusions are similar-to-
slightly larger since the prior study. The cardiac contour is
difficult to  evaluate, but there is probably again associated
bibasilar atelectasis, as
seen on a recent CT. There is no pneumothorax. Leftward conve
thoracolumbar scoliosis is again noted, with a similar
appearance.

[**2188-2-13**] CXR: There is slightly increased moderate-sized
bilateral pleural effusion with atelectasis in both lower lobes.
The lung volume is small. There is continued mild cardiomegaly.
The patient is status post pericardiectomy with median
sternotomy and multiple drains overlying the mediastinum and
bilateral chest tubes.
 No evidence for pneumothorax is identified


[**2188-2-19**] CXR: Comparison is made with the next previous similar
study of [**2188-2-18**]. During the interval, the right
internal jugular vein central venous line has been removed. A
right-sided chest tube located at the right base also has been
removed. No other interval changes can be identified and no
pneumothorax has developed after the tube removal. With the
exception of some linear densities on the left base, no other
pulmonary abnormalities are identified.

PATHOLOGY:

[**2188-2-12**]  I.  "Pericardium for frozen section":

Fibrosis and chronic inflammation; no evidence of malignancy.
II.  "Pericardium":
Fibrosis and chronic inflammation; no evidence of malignancy.

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 53 year old female with a history of restrictive
pericarditis who presented for operative repair. She had a prior
recently diagnosed pulmonary embolus and was therefore admitted
several days prior to her operation and started on a heparin
drip while coumadin was held. She was taken for a
transesophageal echocardiogram on [**2188-2-7**] for evaluation and
planned possible tapping of pericardial fluid; she was found to
have a restrictive pattern with no significant fluid to tap
(please see full report in the results section). She was then
taken to the operating room on [**2188-2-12**] with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 28946**] for repair (please see the operative note for full
details).

The patient had an essentially uncomplicated postoperative
course which was prolonged due to acute renal failure and
resumption of coumadin anticoagulation. She was extubated upon
arrival to the intensive care unit after her operation. Her pain
was well controlled in the post-operative course, initially with
a morphine PCA and eventually with oral narcotics. She was
started on a clear liquids diet on post-op day 1 which was
advanced to a regular diet without complication. She had 4 chest
tubes placed during the operation-- 2 pleural tubes and 2
mediastinal tubes. The mediastinal drian
