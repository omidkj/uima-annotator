Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2751**]
Chief Complaint:
Pleural effusion

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Thoracentesis


History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 34521**] is a 85 yo F with history of hyperlipidemia,
hypertension, CAD and PAF with recent PPM placement s/p lead
revision who presents with fevers, SOB, and pleuritic chest
pain.
.
Of note, she was recently admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] [**Date range (1) 427**] for
pericardial effusions and was found to have small RV perforation
during initial PPM placement.  Her pacer leads were
repositioned, and the effusion was monitored.  Patient was
initially off of warfarin given concern for hemorrhagic
conversion of pericardial effusion but was restarted on warfarin
prior to discharge.  At discharge, patient continued to complain
of SOB and pleuritic chest pain but these were felt to be
related to being in Afib given the presence of her debilitation
and pleural effusions/atelectasis.  Last CXR on [**7-23**] prior to
discharge showed small L pleural effusion and trace R pleural
effusion.
.
At rehab she was doing well until 2 days ago when, after her
cardiology appointment, she suddenly felt very cold and began
having chills.  She then continued to have chills, began having
fevers up to 101.3, developed a productive cough with greenish
sputum and felt more SOB.  Of note, she has also been having CP
on inspiration but this has been going on since her procedure.
She was transferred from rehab to the ED today.
.
In the ED, initial vs were: 97.6, 80, 102/58, 24, 93% 4L Nasal
Cannula.  Her baseline SBP is 130s-140s, and she was in the 90s
in the ED so she was admitted to the ICU for monitoring.  She
received 1L of NS and was given vancomycin and zosyn.  EKG
showed LBBB (unchanged from baseline). CXR showed L pleural
effusion and bedside echo showed a small pericardial effusion
that was measured as 0.4cm.  Cardiology was consulted and felt
this was insignificant.  Vitals on transfer were 92/61, 78, 20,
97% 3-4L NC.

[**8-1**] formal TTE:
LV systolic function appears depressed (ejection fraction 30
percent) primarily due to marked pacemaker-induced mechanical
dyssynchrony (although focal wall motion abnormalities cannot be
excluded with certainty). Right ventricular chamber size and
free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are
mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild to moderate
([**2-2**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The estimated pulmonary
artery systolic pressure is normal. There is a very small
pericardial effusion. There are no echocardiographic signs of
tamponade.

Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed)
of [**2155-7-23**], the findings are similar.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 34521**] is a 85 yo F with a past medical history
significant for hyperlipidemia, hypertension, CAD and PAF with
recent PPM placement s/p lead revision who presents with fevers,
SOB, and pleuritic chest pain due to an exudative pleural
effusion thought to be caused inflammatory reaction to the
recent pacemaker placement verse pneumonia.

# Systolic Congestive Heart Failure: Her systolic blood pressure
during this admission ranged from 90s-140s. We found her to be
fluid over loaded on arrival to the floor, and noted that [**2155-8-1**]
ECHO showed EF in 30% felt to be due to pacer-induced mechanical
dysynchrony of pacing, and began diuresis with IV lasix. She
received one to two doses daily depending on her fluid status on
physical exam. She did have episodes of chest pain on the floor
with unchanged EKG's and flat cardiac enzyems that responded to
another dose of IV lasix. It is unclear whether she was lasix
naive prior to this admission. Her EKG is notable for a prior
LBBB as well as a wide QRS complex and atrial fibrillation.  She
had a pace maker recently placed by the EP department in this
hospital. The EP team was made aware of her admission to
