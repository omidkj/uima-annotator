HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 61-year-old female
with history of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, status
post multiple admissions for DKA; CAD, status post five-
vessel CABG in [**2103**], chronic renal insufficiency, baseline
creatinine approximately 2; hypertension, pancreatitis,
presenting with nausea and vomiting and three days of blood
sugars in the 800 range with an anion gap of 37.  The patient
reports having sudden onset of nausea, vomiting over the
weekend with a glucose approximately 500 associated with
decreased p.o. intake.  The patient described mild substernal
chest pain prior to admission on the day of admission that
was similar to her anginal symptoms.  Chest pain occurred at
nighttime while sleeping, baseline angina occurs weekly.
According to the patient today, she took sublingual
nitroglycerin times 3 without effect.  Denied fever, chills,
shortness of breath, diarrhea, abdominal pain recently
describing a good appetite, but decreased over the past few
days.  In the Emergency Department, the patient was given 10
units of insulin and was started on insulin drip at 6 units
an hour, which was then increased to 8.  Her blood sugar
range went from 700 to 378.  She was transferred to the ICU
for further monitoring.  Other laboratory data were notable
for white blood cell count of 13 with 3 bands.  Her ICU
course was notable for resolution of her gap acidosis;
however, she developed acute on chronic renal failure with a
rise in her creatinine to 3.3 and her BUN to 64 and elevated
amylase of 564 and lipase of 539, troponin leak of 0.2 with
flat CKs.  Currently on transfer, the patient was reporting
some nausea, but without any evidence of vomiting.
Additionally, she noted feeling chest pain since her
admission, which has come and gone and has remained
nonexertional.  She states that it is typical of her
"angina," which preceded her admission.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1. Aspirin 81 mg p.o. q.d.
2. Lipitor 10 mg p.o. q.d.
3. Lantus 20 units h.s.
4. Lopressor 75 mg p.o. b.i.d.
5. Sublingual nitroglycerin.
6. Os-Cal 500 mg q.d.
7. Protonix 40 mg q.d.
8. Zestril 30 mg p.o. q.d.
9. Hydralazine 50 mg q.d.
10.      Lasix 20 mg p.o. b.i.d.
11.      Reglan.
12.      Sucralfate.
13.      Ventolin 40 t.i.d.
14.      Calcium carbonate.
15.      Imdur 120 mg p.o. q.d.


PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON TRANSFER:  Vital signs stable.
General, no apparent distress.  HEENT, dry mucous membranes.
Neck exam, JVP approximately 10 cm at 45 degrees.
Cardiovascular exam, regular rate, S1, S2, 2/6 systolic
murmur heard best at the right upper sternal border.
Pulmonary exam, decreased breath sounds at the bases, no
crackles or wheezing.  Abdominal exam benign.  Extremity exam
benign.  Rectal exam, guaiac-negative brown stool.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  DKA.  The patient was intermittently on
insulin drip while in the ICU, which was off upon transfer.
Her electrolytes remained within normal limits with
resolution of her gap acidosis.  The patient was started on
Glargine and a sliding scale.  She tolerated her p.o. intake
without emesis; however, she was intermittently nauseated.
[**Last Name (un) **] consult was obtained given her frequent recent
admissions.  The patient was maintained on a Humalog sliding
scale as well as her Lantus dosing.  However, the patient was
noncompliant during her hospitalization often times refusing
insulin, and therefore it was very difficult to manage her
sugars appropriately and put her on an adequate regimen upon
discharge.

Infectious disease.  The patient had presented with what
appeared to be viral gastroenteritis.  She did have evidence
of MRSA in her urine.  Therefore, ciprofloxacin was
discontinued.  The patient was started on vancomycin, which
was renally dosed given her renal insufficiency.

Acute on chronic renal failure.  The patient sees Dr.[**Doctor Last Name 4849**]
as an outpatient for her diabetic nephropathy, who was
informed of her admission without any specific
recommendations about her management.  The patient did
receive IV fluids with slow resolution of her renal
insufficiency, and her creatinine slowly began to decrease.

CAD.  Episode of chest pain at home and intermittently here
concerning for unstable angina; however, there were
nonspecific EKG changes associated with this.  The patient
did have an evidence of troponin leak during her
hospitalization; however, CKs were flat.  Her EKG and cardiac
enzymes were unremarkable for active ischemia, and she was
maintained on aspirin, beta-blocker, statin, nitrate.  We
were holding her ACE inhibitor in the setting of worsening
renal failure.  She was also maintained on hydralazine to
maximize her blood pressure control.

Pump.  There was no evidence or signs of heart failure.  She
was not maintained on her diuretics or her ACE inhibitor in
the setting of her acute renal failure.  Her volume status
appeared to be euvolemic.

Rhythm.  Her electrolytes were repleted on a p.r.n. basis.

Hematologic.  The patient has a history of anemia.  She was
on aspirin.  Her hematocrit was 29, was maintained above 30
with transfusion with no evidence of active GI losses.  Given
the patient's history of anemia, the patient was instructed
to have an outpatient colonoscopy for further workup as well
as imaging of her abdomen given her chronically ill
appearance and history of poorly controlled diabetes and
concern was for GI malignancy contributing to this anemia as
well as her chronic bouts of DKA and pancreatitis.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:  Diabetic ketoacidosis.

Poorly controlled type 1 diabetes complicated by nephropathy,
retinopathy, and neuropathy.

Coronary artery disease, status post coronary artery bypass
graft with unstable angina.

Anemia, guaiac-positive stool.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  The patient will be discharged to home
with services.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  The patient is stable, tolerating p.o.
intake with resolution of her symptoms.

SURGICAL/INVASIVE PROCEDURES:  The patient had a PICC line
placed during this hospitalization.

RECOMMENDED FOLLOW-UP:  The patient will see Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1538**] as
an outpatient as well as a visit to the [**Hospital **] Clinic.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1. Aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d.
2. Protonix 40 mg p.o. q.d.
3. Atorvastatin 10 mg p.o. q.d.
4. Metoprolol 75 mg p.o. b.i.d.
5. Calcium carbonate 1 tablet q.i.d.
