Service: NEUROLOGY

Allergies:
Erythromycin Base

Attending:[**Doctor Last Name 15044**]
Chief Complaint:
Generalized weakness.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None.

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 8163**] is a 65 year-old woman with a history of myasthenia
[**Last Name (un) 2902**], stroke ([**2121**]), lung cancer s/p chemoradiation,
hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, atrial fibrillation who
presents from her NH with a history of worsening NIF and
weakness. She was originally admitted on [**3-25**] for endovascular
repair of enlarging aortic aneurysm. She was extubated on POD 1
and on [**3-27**] a medical consult was called for evalution of
hyponatremia; this was felt to be secondary to SIADH. Over the
subsequent days, she was noted to have generalized weakness and
fatigueability. Neurology was consulted on [**3-30**] and per their
note, she complained of limb weakness, facial weakness marked by
difficulty maintaining her eyes open. VC was 0.95L with NIF of
-40 on this date. Her overall post-operative course was
complicated by a myasthenia flare requiring MICU stay with
intubation x2, plasmapheresis x5 treatments, mestinon and
steroids. She was discharged to rehab on [**2122-4-16**] after
experiencing improvement on the floor.

She represented to the emergency room with declining NIF,
weakness and fevers to 100.5 degrees. Per rehab, she had been
feeling well and improving her strength but for the past four to
five days had had worsening weakness. Serial NIFs prior to
transfer were 36 and 24 on the day of transfer. Although she
appeared short of breath she was not complaining of dyspnea.

In the emergency room her initial vitals were T: 98.9 HR: 80 BP:
113/65 RR: 20 O2: 99% on RA. She received levofloxacin 750 mg IV
x 1, methylprednisolone 125 mg IV x 1. She was evaluated by the
neurology consult service who recommended Q2H NIFs and vital
capacity checks. On arrival to the ER her NIF was -30 and her
vital capacity was 1.4.

She was initially admitted to the MICU for serial NIFs.
Medications which can exacerbate myasthenia [**Last Name (un) 2902**] were held
including beta blockers and calcium [**Last Name (un) 21766**] blockers. She was
stable overnight and transferred to the floor in the afternoon
of [**2122-4-25**]. NIF on transfer was -45 with a vital capacity of 1
L.

On review of systems she currently denies fevers, chills. She
does have mild cough but is unable to bring up sputum. She
denies shortness of breath and chest pain. No nausea, vomiting,
abdominal pain, dysuria, hematuria, leg pain or swelling. All
other review of systems negative in detail.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs [**Known lastname 8163**] was intially admitted to the [**Last Name (un) 5355**].  Due to
decreasing NIF and VC she was transferred to the MICU:

This is a 65 year old female with history of myasthenia [**Last Name (un) 2902**],
recent prolonged hospital course after MG flare s/p elective AAA
repair who is transferred to the MICU for increasing weakness
and worsening NIF/Vital Capacity measurements.

#. Myasthenia Flare: For the past week the patient has had
increasing weakness and worsening NIF/vital capacity. Since
transfer to the floor during last hospitalization she has been
stable. Her metoprolol was restarted for atrial fibrillation. On
the night of [**4-26**], the ICU team was called to reassess for
worsening NIF and vital capacity (-32 and 750 cc). Of note she
had recently received Ambien for insomnia. On exam she did not
endorse worsening dyspnea but reported feeling weak persistently
since transfer to rehab. She was unable to receive NIFs more
frequently than [**Hospital1 **] on the floor and so the ICU team was asked
to transfer patient to the MICU. Her ABG was notable for a
compensated chronic respiratory acidosis.  Infectious workup
initiated on admission has been unrevealing.  CXR was negative
for acute cardiopulmonary process. Echocardiogram during this
admission was unremarkable.  She was followed in the ICU for two
days with improving NIF from -33 to -34 to -40 on [**4-28**]. Sedating
medications including Ambien were held. She was continued on
Prednisone, with addition of standing vitamin D and calcium,
insulin sliding scale while on prednisone. She was also
continued on Pyridostigmine, Mycophenolate, and Bactrim
prophylaxis. She was followed by Neurology as well. It remains
unclear whether this is a worsening of her Myasthenia or rather
a prolonged recovery from her previous flare
