HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:   Mr. [**Known lastname 5850**] is a 75 year old
male with a history of coronary artery disease, ischemic
cardiomyopathy, and atrial fibrillation, who presented to
[**Hospital 8641**] Hospital on [**2113-3-16**], complaining of five days of
melena and diffuse abdominal discomfort.  His initial
hematocrit was 33 and on upper endoscopy he was found to have
Barrett's Grade I erosion.  There were plans to do
colonoscopy for further evaluation of sources for
gastrointestinal bleeding and the patient was given a
GoLYTELY bowel prep at [**Hospital 8641**] Hospital.  However, the patient
developed emesis and ten out of ten abdominal pain during
this time, with an episode bradycardia to 30 to 50s range and
decrease in blood pressure to systolic blood pressure in the
90s in the setting of having had a bowel movement and
getting up from the commode.

An arterial blood gas was done after this event and the
patient was found to have a serum pH of 7.24, pCO2 of 27 and
pAO2 of 100 on two liters nasal cannula.  There was initial
concern for a possible colonic acute mesenteric ischemia
given the abdominal pain and hypotension and history of
melena, but abdominal CT scan done at the outside hospital
did not show any evidence of such.

A temporary pacer was placed secondary to the bradycardic
event.  The patient was started on intravenous heparin given
concern for acute mesenteric ischemia with a history of
atrial fibrillation.  The patient was transferred from the
outside hospital for further GI work-up and evaluation.

SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was initially
admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for close
monitoring given history of bradycardia, placement of
temporary pacemaker and history of recent gastrointestinal
bleeding.  Hospital course was notable for the following:

1.  Gastrointestinal Bleeding:  The patient had a known
history of arteriovenous malformations and polyps with
gastrointestinal bleeding in [**2111-3-23**].  EGD done at the
outside hospital showed Grade I esophagitis and CT scan of
the abdomen had already patent mesenteric vessels; no valve
thickening or obstruction.  The patient had had hematocrits
checked after blood transfusion at the outside hospital (at
least one unit of packed red blood cells and two units of
fresh frozen plasma).  The GI consultation service was
consulted for help in managing the patient's history of
gastrointestinal bleeding.  The patient was placed on
intravenous Protonix, fluids and initially n.p.o. with serial
abdominal examinations.

After review of the data, history and CT scan, it was felt
that acute mesenteric ischemia was unlikely to have been
responsible and heparin was discontinued.  On [**3-21**], the
patient underwent a colonoscopy and
esophagogastroduodenoscopy.  The EGD showed medium hiatal
hernia; otherwise a normal EGD to second part of duodenum.
Erosions were seen inside the hernia.  These erosions were
thought to have been the cause for patient's melena and the
GI Consult Service advised keeping patient on Protonix 40 mg
p.o. twice a day times one week, then 40 mg p.o. q. day for
60 days.  The patient's colonoscopy on [**2113-3-21**], showed
polyps in the transverse colon, otherwise normal colonoscopy
to the cecum.  Polypectomy was recommended at a future date
and follow-up when gastrointestinal bleeding and cardiac
issues resolved.

The patient was subsequently monitored with serial checks
with hematocrit which were stable with an initial trend
downward.  He did have hematocrit of around 27 to 28 when
transferred from the Medical Intensive Care Unit to the
regular medical [**Hospital1 **] and given his history of coronary artery
disease, it was felt that he would benefit from blood
transfusion.  He received one unit of packed red blood cells
and his subsequent hematocrits rose from 29 to 31 range and
have remained stable there since.

2.  Cardiovascular:  The patient has a known history of
coronary artery disease and atrial fibrillation.  His serial
cardiac enzymes were sent to rule out myocardial infarction
given recent episode of hypotension and bradycardia.  These
returned negative.  He did have a temporary pacer placed at
the outside hospital for symptomatic bradycardia and
Cardiology consulted on this matter as well.  After review of
the patient's history and hematocrit, it was felt that his
bradycardia was likely due to a combination of vasovagal
episode in the setting of bowel movement during bowel
preparation for colonoscopy and beta blockade with Atenolol
with the possibility of enhanced effects in the setting of
acute renal insufficiency.  His beta blockers were initially
held and the patient had no further episodes of bradycardia.
His blood pressure remained stable and his temporary
pacemaker was discontinued.  Because he did have a history of
atrial fibrillation and did need rate control, low dose beta
blockers were restarted with Metoprolol and have been
titrated up with good rate control and no further episodes of
bradycardia or hypotension.

His history of atrial fibrillation had prompted use of
anti-coagulants in the past, but given the acute episodes of
gastrointestinal bleeding his Coumadin was initial
