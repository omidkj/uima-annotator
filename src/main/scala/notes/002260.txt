IMAGING:
.
CXR ([**8-21**]) - IMPRESSION: Low lung volumes with basilar likely
atelectasis.

CXR ([**8-24**]) - IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**3-30**] and
[**8-21**], read in conjunction with chest CTA [**8-21**]: Mild
cardiomegaly and mediastinal vascular engorgement have both
increased since [**8-21**], suggesting volume overload. No clear
pulmonary edema.  Pleural effusion if any is small, on the
right. No pneumothorax.
.
CXR ([**8-26**]) - IMPRESSION: Bilateral lower lobe atelectasis can be
explained by low lung volumes. New consolidation in the left mid
lung.
.
CT Torso - IMPRESSIONS:
1. No findings to account for the patient's symptoms.
Specifically, no aortic dissection or aneurysm. No pericardial
effusion. No definite large pulmonary embolus.
2. No definite acute intra-abdominal pathology is seen, although
assessment
is slightly limited due to tailoring of the study towards
assessment of the aorta. Perihepatic ascites is decreased.
Cholelithiasis. Mild splenomegaly. Diastasis of the rectus
muscles, with small fat-containing paraumbilical hernia.

Brief Hospital Course:
# AMS, Hypothermia, Hypotension -  Although initially concerning
for SIRS, the patient's altered mental status was likely
secondary to her hypoglycemia.  She was given an amp of D50 in
the field when she was hypoglycemic and her glucose responded
appropriately.  She was started on vancomycin and zosyn
empirically at admission, but these were d/c'ed when her blood
and cultures remained negative.  She also ruled out for ACS with
three sets of negative cardiac enzymes.  Her cortisol level was
normal. She was found to have an elevated TSH with a normal FT4.
 On the day of [**Month/Year (2) **] from the MICU, the patient developed a
episode of oxygen desaturation and was started on levofloxacin
(see below).  By the time she was transferred to the floor, the
patient was alert and oriented to person, place, and time, and
her hypothermia and hypotension had resolved.  She remained that
way for the remainder of her hospital course.
.
# Pneumonia - The patient was intially started on broad coverage
with vancomycin and zosyn at admission.  However, because
cultures were negative and the patient was stable, these
antibiotics were stopped on [**8-23**]. However, on [**8-24**], the patient
developed a episode of oxygen desaturation. CXR was done and was
suspicious for a new opacification in the right lower lung.  She
was started on levofloxacin to complete a 7 day course (3 doses
of levofloxacin q48 hours).  She had some low-grade fevers in
her initial days on the floor.  However, her fevers improved and
she was afebrile at [**Month/Year (2) **].  Of note, during her hospital
stay, the patient continued to require 2 L of O2.  There were
some discrepancies as to whether she actually uses oxygen at
home.  She denied any dyspnea over her baseline, however.  It is
likely that some of this oxygen requirement was secondary to her
frequent refusal to use neb treatments, her insistence to lay
flat in bed, and her refusal to use the hospital CPAP machine.
She was discharged on home O2.
.
# Hypoglycemia - Seems that patient's hypoglycemia on admission
was likely secondary to taking exogenous insulin, glipizide, and
possibly poor PO intake.  On admit, her glipizide was
discontinued and she was placed on sliding scale insulin.  Once
she was on the floor, [**Last Name (un) **] was consulted and placed the
patient on a regimen of 75/25 [**Hospital1 **] with an insulin sliding scale
to cover for hyperglycemia.  Her [**Hospital1 **] dosing was adjusted during
her hospitalization and she was discharged on a regimen of 70/30
[**Hospital1 **] with an insuling sliding scale.  She was also scheduled for
follow-up with the [**Hospital **] clinic.
.
# Atrial Fibrillation - On admission to the MICU, the patient's
nodal blocking agents were intially held.  She did develop some
episodes of RVR, which responded to IV metoprolol and diltiazem.
 Her PO metoprolol and diltiazem were restarted prior to
transfer to the floor.  Of note, her metoprolol dose was
increased to 37.5 mg [**Hospital1 **].  On the floor, she did have a few
episodes of RVR, but they were all in the setting of her
dilatizem having been held secondary to hypotension.  She was
discharged on her diltiazem and the new dose of metoprolol.  Of
no
