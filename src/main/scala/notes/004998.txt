Service:  CCU

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 64-year-old
male with a history of CAD, atrial fibrillation, diabetes,
and CHF, who presented to an outside hospital on [**2120-7-17**] with
congestive heart failure.  He was seen, initially, by his
cardiologist, was noted to be short of breath with a 20 pound
weight gain in one month due to dietary indiscretion, and was
admitted to [**Hospital **] Hospital.  He was initially treated with
intravenous Lasix and Zaroxolyn, and subsequently started on
nesiritide, nitroglycerin, and dobutamine.  He only responded
mildly to these measures, and a transthoracic echocardiogram
there demonstrated an ejection fraction of 15% with moderate
mitral regurgitation and tricuspid regurgitation with
elevated pulmonary artery pressures in the 60's.  After one
week at the outside hospital, the patient was transferred to
[**Hospital1 69**] Heart Failure Service
for further treatment.  At the time of presentation, the
patient also had an elevated BUN and creatinine level of 77
and 1.7, respectively.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient denies any tobacco or alcohol
usage currently.  He lives at home with his wife.  [**Name (NI) **] has
been essentially house bound recently.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient was afebrile with a
temperature of 98.4, heart rate 56, blood pressure 90/60,
respiratory rate 20, and oxygen saturation 96% on three
liters by nasal cannula.  In general, the patient was awake
and alert, in mild respiratory distress.  Head and neck exam
revealed pupils equal, round, and reactive to light, mildly
icteric sclerae, and supple neck.  The lungs had bilateral
crackles at the bases with occasional wheezes.  Cardiac exam
was significant for distant heart sounds with a normal S1 and
S2 and a II/VI systolic murmur at the apex.  JV pulsation was
to the level of the earlobe.  The abdomen was obese with no
tenderness and positive bowel sounds.  The extremities had 2+
bilateral pitting edema to the thighs.  Neurologically, the
patient was alert and oriented times three.

LABORATORY/DIAGNOSTICS:  On admission, white blood count of
9, hematocrit of 41.2, and platelets were 203.  Panel-7
showed a sodium of 135, potassium of 3.5, chloride of 88,
bicarbonate of 33, BUN of 128, and creatinine of 2.0, with
glucose of 60.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  CHF: The patient was started on nesiritide to assist with
diuresis.  He responded with mild diuresis in the absence of
further diuretic usage over the first three days.  On the
third hospital day, the patient complained of left flank
pain, and the next morning he was found unresponsive with
bradycardia and hypotension.  He was subsequently noted to
have a retroperitoneal bleed and required large volumes of
blood products for resuscitation.  The patient was grossly
positive in terms of volume, but, as he was hemodynamically
stabilized, he was successfully diuresed with IV Lasix alone.
Subsequently, the patient was restarted on nesiritide for his
heart failure, in addition to Bumex and Diuril.  Future
issues for his congestive heart failure will require diet
education, medication compliance, evaluation for
biventricular pacing, and consideration for direct
cardioversion once stabilized.

2.  Retroperitoneal bleed:  The patient was started on
anticoagulation with heparin for his atrial flutter, and was
noted to be therapeutic at the time of onset of left flank
pain.  A subsequent laboratory value demonstrated an elevated
PTT of greater than 150, which was the only risk factor
present for the retroperitoneal bleed.  He was transfused
with eight units of packed red blood cells, as well as eight
units of fresh frozen plasma, prior to achieving hemodynamic
stability.  The patient's PTT normalized after stopping the
heparin drip, however, his INR remained elevated between 1.5
to 1.8.  Vascular Surgery consultation suggested conservative
management with correction of the coagulopathy and
transfusions as necessary to maintain the patient's
hematocrit.

3.  Renal failure:  The patient's baseline creatinine is not
certain, however, at the outside hospital he presented with a
creatinine of 1.7 and, initially, the patient's creatinine
decreased to 1.4 prior to his retroperitoneal bleed.  He had
a peak creatinine of 3.3 which was likely due to
hypoperfusion secondary to volume loss, but his creatinine
improved to 1.8 at the time of dictation.  The patient's
elevated BUN, which was persistently high at greater than
100, was likely due to reabsorption of the retroperitoneal
hematoma.

4.  Pulmonary:  The patient was continued on his Combivent
inhalers until the time of his bleed, at which time he was
intubated.  The patient was mechanically ventilated for six
days, after which he was placed on BiPAP.

5.  Rhythm:  The patient remained in atrial
fibrillation/flutter and his anticoagulation was held
secondary to the recent retroperitoneal bleed.  Any
anticoagulation should be avoided in the near future, and
decision to anticoagulate with Coumadin should be made
following discharge.

6.  Infectious disease:  The patient developed a fever and
elevated white blood count at the time of his retroperitoneal
bleed.  Blood cultures, urine cultures, and sputum cultures
were not suggestive of an infection, nor was chest x-ray
particularly suggestive of a pneumonia.  A right groin line
tip which was placed during intubation grew enterococcus that
was penicillin sensitive.  He was empirically treated with
vancomycin, levofloxacin, and Flagyl, and the vancomycin was
subsequently changed to ampicillin.  He should complete a ten
day course of these antibiotics.  At the time of dictation,
the patient's fever curve had decreased, and his white blood
count was normalizing.

7.  Diabetes:  The patient was started on an insulin drip
while in the CCU.  He will be maintained on this drip with
goal blood glucoses less than 110, after which he can be
switched back to his outpatient regimen.

8.  F/E/N:  Patient was started on enteral tube feeds per
nutrition recommendations.  He became hypernatremic during
this hospitalization and required free water fluid boluses.
The patient will need a swallowing study prior to
reinstituting PO's.
Further hospital course and discharge plan will be dictated
at a later time.
