Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 13685**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest Pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
37 yo F w h/o endocarditis after PICC placement veg on AV, AI,
stroke who presented with chest pain. She reports that she was
in her usual state of health recently,without limitation by
symptoms of dyspnea, chest pain. She has occasional
lightheadedness which sounds postural in nature. On the morning
of admit, she awoke with "tightness" in herleft arm and shoulder
which steadily progressed throughout the day. Then around 6 pm
on the day of admission she developed severe, substernal,
spasm-like pain in the anterior chest with radiation to the back
and presented to the ED within 2 hours. This occurred for
several seconds at a time and reports that it would then lessen,
but never fully go away. The pain is worse lying down or sitting
forward and is pleuritic in nature. She reports that the takes
asa and plavix every day and took them today as normal. No
nausea, dyspnea, lightheadedness. No back pain.
.
In the ED, initial vitals were Temp 98.7, HR 90, BP 137/88, RR
18, O2 100%
Labs and imaging significant for negative troponin and CK-MB.
CTA showed no no PE or aortic dissection. Unchanged 19 mm
outpouching from the anterior portion of aortic root is most
likely a pseudoaneurysm based on prior imaging. Multifocal
ground glass and peribronchovascular ground glass opacities
consistent with pneumonia. A bedside echo showed a structure in
the LV.
Patient given CeftriaXONE 1g, dilaudid 1mg with good reduction
in her pain.
Vitals on transfer were 98.4, 84, 123/70, 22, 100%
.
On arrival to the floor, patient continues to have pain, but
greatly diminished. Appears comfortable at this time.
.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS
On review of systems she denies any history of deep venous
thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery,
myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red
stools. She denies recent fevers, chills or rigors. She denies
exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other review of
systems were negative.

Past Medical History:
AORTIC VALVE INSUFFIC- Long history:
- [**2142**]: Had PICC line placed for hyperemesis gravidum-->
bacteremia which caused meningitis, septic emboli to kidney's
and aortic valve endocardidits. Managed medically.
.
- [**7-/2144**]: SOB led to dx of aortic insufficiency. Had st Jude
valve replacement.
.
- [**12/2144**]: Again SOB led to echo which showed insuff + cavity
adjacent to aortic valve. The patient was sent to the OR during
that hospitalization for a re-op aortic valve replacement, at
which time a #21 mechanical valve was placed. There was
reconstruction of the anterior mitral leaflets, aortic annulus,
and proximal ascending aorta with a patch. Post op course
complicated by stroke with left sided hemiparesis (resolved
throughout hospitalization), SVT. Blood cultures negative
throughout.
.
- Spring [**2144**]: The patient was readmitted with findings
suggesting a perivalvar abscess and a perivalvar leak along with
partial aortic valve dehiscence. On [**3-/2145**] underwent reoperative
aortic valve replacement with a #23 homograft. The upper portion
of the anterior mitral leaflet attached to the homograft was
sewn into two-thirds of the patient's anterior mitral leaflet.
Samples were sent no organisms and rhemu consult was obtained
that was reportedly negative. Operation complicated by
perioperative MI on [**2145-4-28**] with reintubation necessary.
Emergent cardiac cath revealed high-grade stenosis at the ostium
of the left main artery (?secondary to aortic wall edema) which
required stenting of the left main and placement of intraaortic
balloon pump, which was subsequently weaned. Rpeat cath at [**Hospital1 112**]
in [**10/2145**] showed patent graft.

EKG:  EKG demonstrated sinus rhythm with incomplete RBBB,
nonspecific
ST and T wave changes.  Compared to most recent prior tracing
([**2149-2-4**]) the ST and T wave changes are more pronounced. Compared
with prior from [**2148-10-15**], there is no change.
.
CTA: [**2149-8-1**]
IMPRESSION:
1.  No pulmonary embolism.
2.  Unchanged 1.9 cm outpouching from the anterior portion of
the aortic root, most likely represents a pseudoaneurysm.
3.  Multifocal pneumonia.
.
TTE: [**2149-8-1**]
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses and cavity size are normal. Due to suboptimal
technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be
fully excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
normal (LVEF=55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. An aortic valve homograft is present. There
is a 1.2 x 1.0 cm pseudoaneurysm along the anterior aspect of
the LV outflow tract immediately below the aortic valve. It does
not appear to involve the origin of the right coronary artery
(clip [**Clip Number (Radiology) **]). No high-velocity flow is seen in to/out of the
psuedoaneurysm (suggesting it has not ruptured). No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is
a trivial pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Left ventricular outflow tract pseudoaneurysm as
described above without color flow Doppler evidence of rupture.
Normal functioning aortic valve homograft. Normal biventricular
cavity sizes with preserved global biventricular systolic
function.


Brief Hospital Course:
37 yo woman with complicated history of aortic valve
endocarditis requiring ultimately a homograft with stroke and
perioperative MI requiring left main stent, with evidence of a
possible pseudoaneurysm of the anterior LVOT who presents with
chest pain.

# Chest Pain: The patient has a long cardiac history but no
documented CAD. The current chest pain is not associted with CE
elevation and the EKG is unchanged from a seperate admission for
chest pain in 10/[**2147**]. At th
