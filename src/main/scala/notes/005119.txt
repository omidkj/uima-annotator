ADMISSION HISTORY AND PHYSICAL:  Mr. [**Known lastname 7860**] is a [**Age over 90 **] year old
male with a past medical history of aortic stenosis and
hypertension who had been in a generally reasonable
functional state prior to presentation. He presented on
[**11-8**] with repeat episodes of bright red blood per
rectum and some abdominal pain for which he was admitted to
the Medical Service.  He had already been scheduled for a
prior colonoscopy. At the time of his admission, he had not
had any notable fevers, no trauma to the abdomen and no
hematemesis. His temperature was 99.1 and he was otherwise
hemodynamically stable with an oxygen saturation of 96
percent. He wasn't in any distress on admission. His lungs
otherwise had rales at the bases, but his heart was regular.
His belly was soft. He had a mild amount of tenderness in the
right and left lower quadrant, but otherwise no rebound or
guarding. His admission white count was 8.3 with hematocrit
of 34 and notably had 35 percent bands. His BUN and
creatinine were 25 and 0.9 respectively. His EKG showed T-
wave inversion in Lead III which was new.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the Medical
Service and started on antibiotics which included
levofloxacin and Flagyl for his bandemia and underwent a CT
scan which showed some nonspecific circumferential thickening
of the sigmoid colon. He therefore underwent his
sigmoidoscopy with a variable colonoscope on [**2161-11-13**]. This was a limited exam of the left colon due to lack
of bowel preparation but blood was noted in the colon with
significant diverticulosis. Postoperatively, the patient
continued to have significant abdominal pain and on further
workup, was found to have free air in the peritoneum and
therefore there was concern for colonic perforation. As the
patient's clinical status deteriorated, the Surgical Service
was consulted and a decision was made to take the patient to
the Operating Room given the fact that he had evidence of
peritonitis with free air under the diaphragm indicating
likely colonic perforation with gross spillage of stool.
There was concern that he had had myocardial infarction, but
given the fact that his septic state would not improve
without surgery after consultation with General Surgery,
Colorectal Surgery and Gastroenterology, it was decided that
the patient should be taken to the Operating Room. On
[**11-13**], he underwent a left colectomy with a Hartmann's
pouch and a transverse colostomy. Intraoperatively, it was
noted that the descending colon was markedly inflamed and
thickened. There was no evidence of a tumor. This was
subsequently sent for pathology and showed evidence of
colitis, but no other malignancy. The patient postoperatively
was taken to the Intensive Care Unit where he remained for
the duration of his hospitalization. Neurologically, the
patient remained mentally alert. His pain was controlled with
a variety of narcotics. There were no other issues. In terms
of his respiratory status, the patient developed pulmonary
edema postoperatively secondary to large fluid requirements
and some cardiac insufficiency. These were complicated by
pleural effusions and what appeared to be an ARDS picture.
Although attempts were made to wean him off the ventilator
with aggressive diuresis and various ventilator management
strategies, the patient was never able to wean to extubation.
In terms of his cardiovascular issues, after his initial
myocardial infarction, the patient continued to have a mild
troponin leak. We attempted to optimize his cardiac status
medically, but the patient did require significant
vasopressors including Levophed to maintain his blood
pressure. A variety of combinations of pressors were used
including dobutamine to augment the patient's cardiac output.
Management of this was facilitated by the use of a Swan-Ganz
catheter. During the course of the patient's hospitalization,
he began to experience repeated episodes of nonsustained
ventricular tachycardia. These never did progress to a
sustained ventricular tachycardia or ventricular
fibrillation. The patient's initial problem of his colonic
perforation was managed appropriately with his colectomy and
transverse colostomy. Unfortunately, secondary to the
patient's poor nutritional status and his gross infection,
his wound dehisced on postoperative day 8 at which time he
was subsequently taken back to the Operating Room and re-
explored and repaired. A VAC dressing was subsequently
applied to facilitate with wound closure. The patient had
significant hyperbilirubinemia. A right upper quadrant
ultrasound was performed, but there wasn't any evidence of
cholecystitis or bile duct obstruction and it was felt to be
secondary to his septic state and cholestasis. Renally, the
patient continued to progressively develop acute renal
insufficiency with rising creatinine which at the time of his
death was twice his baseline. Hematologically, the patient
did have an anemia secondary to a combination of blood loss,
malnutrition and volume. He required multiple transfusions
for this. He also had thrombocytopenia which stabilized.
There was no evidence of heparin-induced antibodies.The
patient's most critical issues included his Infectious
Disease issues. He suffered from a series of pneumonias which
included [**Female First Name (un) 564**] albicans. His peritoneal fluid grew out gram-
negative rods which included E. coli and were consistent with
feculent material. Otherwise, his most serious issue was
Candidemia. The patient was found to have multiple episodes
of [**Female First Name (un) 564**] albicans growing on blood cultures even after his
vascular access lines had been changed. Given this poor
prognostic sign, a meeting took place with the family to
determine the patient's overall status and goals for
treatment. It was felt at this time, given his respiratory
failure, his septic state, his adrenal insufficiency, his
renal failure and his Candidemia, that the patient should be
made a Do Not Resuscitate, but the family wanted to continue
all aggressive medical care which the ICU team agreed to.
Attempts at optimizing his medical status were continued for
one week after the time of making the patient Do Not
Resuscitate, but the patient failed to improve. Given his
failure to improve and grim prognosis, it was decided by the
family to make the patient Comfort Measures Only which was
done on [**2161-12-6**]. The patient expired at [**2186**] hours
on [**2161-12-6**] with the final cause of death being respiratory
arrest.
