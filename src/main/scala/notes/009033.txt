Admission Date:  [**2114-11-26**]     Discharge Date:  [**2114-12-7**]

Date of Birth:   [**2094-5-22**]     Sex:  M

Service:  CCU

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 20-year-old
male recently admitted from [**Date range (1) 45308**]/[**2114**] with a complaint
of three months history of fatigue and three weeks history of
dyspnea, and one week of chest pressure and cough.  He had
been seen at an outside hospital and initially treated for
pneumonia based on a chest x-ray with bilateral infiltrates.
Later however, he had an echocardiogram which revealed wall
motion abnormalities.  He was transferred to [**Hospital1 346**] for further evaluation.  He had a
complete workup to determine etiology.  Ischemic toxic
infections and filterative tachycardia induced, catecholamine
induced, endocrine, oncology, and vascular causes were all
ruled out.

An echocardiogram on [**2114-10-26**] revealed an ejection fraction
of 20%, moderate dilated LA, left ventricular cavity is
severely dilated, severe global LVHK, RV chamber size was
normal, but with mild global RV free wall hypokinesis, severe
4+ mitral regurgitation, and borderline systemic
hypertension.

Patient also had a cardiac MRI on [**2114-10-30**] which revealed
severely elevated left ventricular cavity size with severe
global hypokinesis and moderate increase in left ventricular
mass with RV dilatation, hyperkinesis, and moderate-to-severe
mitral regurgitation with no evidence of primary myocardial
scarring or infarction.  These findings were consistent with
nonischemic cardiomyopathy.  He was admitted from [**2034-11-21**] to
the CCU with a complaint of nausea, vomiting, and shortness
of breath.  At that time, he was treated with diuretics, and
he was then discharged home.

He then presented again on [**2115-11-26**] with nausea and
vomiting.  Three days prior to admission he had developed
increasing nausea and vomiting.  He has also noted increased
PND, orthopnea, and shortness of breath.  He denied any chest
pain or lower extremity edema.  He denied any acute weight
gain, but he had an overall weight gain since prior to this
admission.  He also reported diaphoresis.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Dilated cardiomyopathy.

MEDICATIONS:
1. Lisinopril 20 mg po q day.
2. Digoxin 0.125 mg po qod.
3. Lasix 40 mg po bid.
4. Coumadin 2 mg po q day.
5. Toprol XL 25 mg po q day.
6. Protonix 40 mg po q day.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Positive tobacco history, quit in [**10/2114**],
one pack per day history for 10 years.  He recently got
married, but does not live with his bride.  Currently living
with his mother.  Alcohol history:  One to two drinks per
month, sometimes 10-30 beers per episode.

FAMILY HISTORY:  No coronary artery disease.  His father is
less than 60 years old and his mother is less than 65 years
old.

PHYSICAL EXAM ON PRESENTATION:  Temperature is 97.6, blood
pressure 96/70, heart rate 113, respiratory rate 20, and
oxygen saturation is 98% on room air.  General appearance:
Very pleasant young man in no acute distress.  HEENT:  Mucous
membranes moist.  Neck:  No jugular venous distention.
Heart:  Regular, rate, and rhythm, S1, S2, no murmurs, rubs,
or gallops.  Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally.  No
crackles, rhonchi or wheezes.  Abdomen is soft, nontender,
nondistended, positive bowel sounds, no hepatosplenomegaly,
no right upper quadrant tenderness.  Extremities warm, no
edema, 2+ dorsalis pedis pulses.  Neurologic:  Cranial nerves
II through XII are grossly intact, 5/5 strength in upper and
lower extremities bilaterally.

BRIEF HOSPITAL COURSE:  Mr. [**Known lastname 45309**] is a 20-year-old male
with a history of idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy admitted
with nausea and vomiting.

Cardiomyopathy:  He underwent right sided cardiac
catheterization which reveals right atrium 15, RV 55/11, P.A.
47%, cardiac index 1.44, which improved to 1.52 post
nitroglycerin, P.A. 55/36, which improved to 55/33 post
nitroglycerin, wedge 30 which went to 31 post nitroglycerin,
PVR 4.33 which went to 3.51 post nitroglycerin.  Ejection
fraction of approximately 20%.

A Swan was placed, and he was started on Natrecor for
aggressive diuresis.  He initially responded well, so
Natrecor was titrated up and Bumex was added.  However, after
two days of nitroglycerin therapy, Natrecor appeared to be no
longer achieving any diuresis and his cardiac output and
cardiac index decreased again.  He was therefore switched to
milrinone and Bumex with initial improvement.  Once again,
the milrinone appeared to be not effective for him, and he
was switched back to Natrecor with mild effect.

Meanwhile, a screening workup for cardiac transplant was
started.  This included a psychiatric consult, which revealed
a past medical history of suicide attempts.  However, at this
time, the patient appeared to be not depressed and not
suicidal.  Eventually, Natrecor also appeared to have become
not effective on him.  He was therefore started only on
lisinopril which was titrated up, and Carvedilol was also
considered, but because of past unpleasant reactions such as
aggression, it was not started.  Spironolactone was
eventually added to his regimen, but his improvement
continued to be marginal.

He therefore required IABP placement.  On [**2114-12-7**] as his
transplant screening workup had been completed, he was
transferred for [**Hospital1 336**] for either emergent heart transplant or
external pump placement.

Anticoagulation:  He developed thrombocytopenia while on
Heparin and Coumadin.  Heparin and Coumadin were both
stopped.  HIT were checked and was found to be positive.  He
was therefore started on Angiomax for anticoagulation with
improvement in his thrombocytopenia.  An individual antibody
responsible for HIT were requested from the laboratory, and
were pending at the time of his transfer to [**Hospital 8503**].

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1. Dilated cardiomyopathy of unknown etiology.
2. Hypertension.
3. Thrombocytopenia.
4. Positive antibodies responsible for Heparin-induced
thrombocytopenia.

DISCHARGE PLANS:  The patient was transferred to [**Hospital 8503**] for either emergent cardiac transplant or
external pump placement.
