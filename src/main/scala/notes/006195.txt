HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 55 year-old female
with a past medical history significant for rheumatic heart
disease status post mitral valve regurgitation in [**2155**],
atrial fibrillation, congestive heart failure, hypothyroidism
who was in her usual state of health until ten days prior to
admission where she started having low grade temperature and
malaise, subsequently diagnosed with a urinary tract
infection by her primary care physician and started on Cipro.
There was no improvement.  Continued nausea and vomiting,
developed blurry vision, anorexia about two days prior.

She was brought to the Emergency Room and was found to have
wide complex bradycardia heart rate 40 to 60 irregular with
hypotension with a systolic blood pressure in the 70s.  She
was admitted [**Hospital1 69**] secondary
to a Digoxin level of 3.3.  Her cardiac medications were held
after being given a low dose of Dopamine as well as fluid
boluses.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Atrial fibrillation.
2.  Rheumatic heart disease status post mitral valve
regurgitation in [**2155**].
3.  Congestive heart failure.
4.  Hypothyroidism.
5.  Depression.
6.  Osteoporosis.
7.  History of transient ischemic attack in [**2164**].
8.  History of seizure disorder times three years.
9.  Hyperthyroidism.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  No tobacco.  Occasional ethanol.

HOME MEDICATIONS:
1.  Lisinopril 40 mg q.d.
2.  Coreg 6.25 mg b.i.d.
3.  Digoxin 0.25 mg q.d.
4.  Coumadin.
5.  Fosamax 10 mg q.d.
6.  Tums four tabs q.d.
7.  Lasix 40 mg q.d.
8.  Depakote 250 mg b.i.d.
9.  Synthroid 88 micrograms q.d.
10. Prempro.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Positive for dyspnea on exertion after
one flight of stairs.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Pulse 40 to 50 irregular.  Blood
pressure 95/56 with a mean arterial pressure of 66.  Sating
98% on 2 liters nasal cannula.  HEENT extraocular movements
intact.  Dry mucous membranes.  Neck supple without
lymphadenopathy.  JVP present.  Lungs clear to auscultation
bilaterally.  Crackles at the left base.  Cardiovascular
irregularly irregular with a mechanical S1 and normal S2.  No
murmurs, rubs or gallops.  Abdomen is soft, mild right lower
quadrant discomfort.  Extremities no edema.

ADMISSION LABORATORIES:  White blood cell count 8.6,
hematocrit 33.4, platelets 262, sodium 141, potassium 4.3,
chloride 99, bicarb 29, BUN 58, creatinine 3.4, glucose 124,
calcium 13.1, phos 4.5, magnesium 213.  INR 7.0, PTT 39.7,
Digoxin 3.3, valproate level 70.  Arterial blood gas on
admission 7.36 pH, PCO2 38, pO2 295 on 1 liter of nasal
cannula, lactate 1.7.

Electrocardiogram showed atrial fibrillation also left
ventricular bigeminy with a rate of 50 and QRS of 112.

Chest x-ray:  There is cardiomegaly and diffuse bilateral
interstitial markings.  There is a small effusion in the
right costophrenic angle.  No pneumothorax.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the Coronary
Care Unit for possible temporary pacing wires.  Digoxin
toxicity is the likely etiology.  Digoxin was held and not
restarted on discharge.  The Digoxin level fell to 1.3 on
[**10-16**].  Electrocardiogram changes resolved to
baseline.  Electrolytes were repleted including potassium.
The patient was weaned off Dopamine and tolerated it well.
The primary respiratory acidosis resolved with resolution of
the elevated creatinine to baseline of 1.1 following fluid
resuscitation.  However, she developed congestive heart
failure secondary to the resuscitation, but did respond well
to diuresis and is now stable.

A CT of her head was used to evaluate a new dysarthria and
that was negative for any acute process.  Urine cultures and
blood cultures were also negative.

During the course the patient complained of abdominal pain
with nausea and vomiting and also abdominal CT revealed
gallbladder thickening and a 2 cm gallstone, but without
ductal dilatation.  The pain resolved on its own and
outpatient follow up was recommended for possible elective
cholecystectomy.
