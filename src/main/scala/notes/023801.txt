Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 949**]
Chief Complaint:
altered mental status

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
50yoM w/ HCV/ETOH cirrhosis s/p OLT in [**2192**] w/ recidivant ETOH
use and resulting cirrhosis of liver graft c/b ascites,
encephalopathy, and jaundice presented to OSH on [**12-25**] with 3-4
days of increasing confusion and disorientation. Pt using remote
control as telephone and turning on stove and forgetting. Told
wife that something wrong with him and taken to ED. Also wife
said she was worried b/c she thought he was taking too much
verapamil. Patient also w/ new scratch on chin, but not sure how
he got it so worried he had fallen). Per report, patient had
been taking the wrong amount of verapamil for unknown reasons
(240mg [**Hospital1 **], rather than actual dose of 120mg daily vs 120mg
[**Hospital1 **]?), and was bradycardic upon arrival to the OSH. At the OSH,
he received epinephrine and aptropine. He is currently in NSR at
a rate of 80's with blood pressures in 100's/60's.
.
He is intubated for airway protection. He was tried on CPAP
yesterday, but then switched back to AC reportedly because of
acidosis with a gas of 7.20/42/90/15, poor MS, ?volume overload,
? restrictive defect assoc w/ ascites. His current vent settings
are AC 450x16, PEEP 5, Fio2 40%. He is on propofol for sedation.
Per nursing report, they are suctioning thick secretions from
the ET tube, though he remains afebrile. Sputum sample was sent
from [**Hospital 931**] hospital and is pending. WBC this AM was 11.8.
.
Also at the OSH, noted to have new renal failure with Creatinine
peaking at 4.0, with todays creatinine at 3.2. His baseline is
0.8. Most recent LFT's from today are ALT 291, AST 83, Tbili
3.4, AP 136.
.
Also, pt noted to have Hct of 22 on admission. He has received 2
units PRBC's, now with a stable Hct (27.9 today, baseline is
28-30). Per report, no h/o melena, coffee grounds on flushing of
NGT or hematochezia. As part of his workup for the low Hct, he
had CT A/P, which showed ? SBO. He had decompression with NGT,
and has been stooling. He is receiving lactulose Q2 hours.
.
He has a triple lumen in the L subclavian currently.
.
Currently pt is intubated, but calm. Nods his head no when asked
if pain/complaints/cough/fever/abdominal pain. Other history
obtained from medical records, nursing communication, and wife.

Imaging:
CXR [**12-27**]
FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**8-31**], there is an
endotracheal
tube in place approximately 3 cm above the carina. Nasogastric
tube is coiled within the upper stomach. Low lung volumes may
contribute to the increased prominence of the cardiac
silhouette. There is poor definition of an apparently engorged
pulmonary vessels, consistent with increased pulmonary venous
pressure, though respiratory motion may be enhancing this
appearance. Opacification in the retrocardiac region is
consistent with atelectasis, though the possibility of
supervening pneumonia would have to be considered in the
appropriate clinical setting.
.
RUQ US ([**2198-12-28**]):
1. Persistent reversal of flow within the portal veins.
2. The right and left hepatic veins were not well visualized.
The middle
hepatic vein appears patent.
3. Liver cirrhosis with areas of increased echogenicity,
unchanged.
4. Persistent pneumobilia.
5. Moderate amount of right lower quadrant ascites. Small amount
of fluid in the left lower quadrant.
6. Surgical absence of the spleen.
.
TTE ([**2198-12-28**]): The left atrium is moderately dilated. No atrial
septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size
and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). A mid-cavitary
gradient is identified. There is no ventricular septal defect.
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. The
ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no
aortic regurgitation. There is no valvular aortic stenosis. The
increased transaortic velocity is likely related to high cardiac
output. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with
trivial mitral regurgitation. There is no mitral valve prolapse.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired
relaxation. There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
.
CXR ([**2198-12-29**]): Mild vascular congestion and small right
effusion. No acute
change post-extubation

Brief Hospital Course:
50 year old male with hepatitis C/alcohol cirrhosis s/p OLT in
[**2192**] with recidivant ETOH use and resulting cirrhosis of liver
graft complicated by ascites, encephalopathy, and jaundice
presented to OSH on [**12-25**] with one week of increasing confusion
which led to verapamil overdose, complicated by hypotension,
bradycardia, acute renal failure and intubated for airway
protection.

1. Respiratory Failure/Airway protection: Gas at OSH on CPAP
suggested metabolic acidosis, likely in the setting of renal
failure.  He was intubated also to protect his airway.  Initial
CXR at OSH showed concern for pneumonia with bronch stain
showing gram positive cocci in pairs.  He was empirically
started on Vancomycin/Zosyn and completed 8 days of antibiotics.
 He was extubated on [**12-28**] with no complications.

2. Acute renal failure: Likely due to ATN in the setting of poor
forward flow due to bradycardia/hypotension reported at OSH.
Creatinine returned to baseline of 1.0 prior to admission.

3. Encephalopathy: Initial insult could be community acquired
pneumonia for which he got 8 days of IV antibiotics.  CT head at
the OSH was negative along with urine tox screen.  His wife
reported compliance with his medications.  Blood and urine
cultures have been negative at OSH and here.  RUQ showed patent
vasculature while mild-moderate ascites was never tapped for
SBP.  His encepha
