Chief Complaint:
Seizure

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 57 year-old man with history of ESRD on HD,
long seizure history and diastolic chf admitted after grand mal
seizure, intubation for airway protection and hypoxic
respiratory failure. Patient in USOH on his keppra and lamictal
until this AM when he had witnessed 1 minute grand mal seizure.
Patient was post-ictal, EMS was activated and brought to ED. In
ED, agitated, had negative head CT and then desatted to 70's.
Intubated for airway protection and hypoxic respiratory failure.


Concerning patient's seizure history, last gm seizure about 6
months ago as per family, but has had occasional non-convulsive
seizure as well more recently. Seizures had been well-controlled
until roughly 4 years ago when depakoate was discontinued due to
elevated ammonia levels. More recnetly, patient on lamictal and
keppra with good control, followed by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 437**]. With
respect to possible toxic-metabolic causes: Patient on HD,
uremia likely lowering threshold. Also, consider infection but
patient without significant localizing symptoms as per family.
No pain, does have mild cough. LFT's within normal limits,
finger stick normal in ED and sugar by chem-7's normal.

Concerning his recent resp history: Patient suffered mechanical
fall on [**10-31**] with trauma to left chest wall with negative CXR,
CT head. Since that time he has had increasing sob, doe but
there is no clear objective mech cause for his sob, doe. After
this he was started on home oxygen, echo on [**11-1**] showed ef of
40% with 1-2+MR. [**Name13 (STitle) **] has needed to have increasing amounts of
volume removed with dialysis over this time which has been
limited by hypotension. He was admitted on [**11-19**] for what
appeared to be heart failure, was diuresed with HD, left AMA on
[**11-21**] before repeat echo obtained. Negative CTA at that time.
Family reports patient sob, using home oxygen intermittently
since discharge.

In the MICU, the patient was diuresied 5.5L over 2 days.  He was
intubated on arrival and this was removed the following day,
with the patient now oxygenating well on NC.  He was seen by
neurology who put him on an ativan taper, increased his lamictal
to 200BID and continued his keppra.


Past Medical History:
seizures since childhood, which began as generalized
tonic-clonic. He was treated with phenobarbitol and Mysoline.
Later, was changed to Depakote and Dilantin. Depakote was
discontinued roughly 4 years ago due to elevated ammonia levels.

Since, then his seizures have increased in frequency and
severity. As a result, muliple medications inculding Lamictal,
Trileptal, Tegretol and Keppra have been tried and he has most
recently been on combination of Keppra and Lamictal. His
seizures have been occuring about once every 1-2 months. Usual
episodes are
characterized by confusion and disorientation with rare,
generalized tonic clonic episodes. As per OMR notes, he has a
history of non-convulsive status which presented as confusion in

the past and responded to ativan.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient is a 57 y/o man with history of ESRD on HD, seizure
disorder, chf admitted s/p grand mal seizure and with subsequent
hypoxic respiratory failure.

On arrival in the ED, the patient was intubated for airway
protection.  He was transferred to the MICU where he was quickly
weaned and extubated.  In the ICU, they felt like he was also
having a subacute CHF exacerbation and he was diuresed 5.5 L
with dilaysis. He is going to have an outpatient ECHO to see if
there is any progression of his CHF.  He is also planning to see
a pulmonologist to evaluate for an intrinsic lung disease.

He was seen by neurology who put him on an ativan taper,
increased his lamictal to 200BID and continued his keppra.

Renal was following and restarted his lisinipril at a lower
dose, toprol XL, and nifedipine.

The patient was transferred to the floor where he was observed
overnight and discharged the next morning.  He was cleared by PT
