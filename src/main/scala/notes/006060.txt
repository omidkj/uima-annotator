Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2024**]
Chief Complaint:
Respiratory distress

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
J-tube replacement x 2.
2 blood transfusions


History of Present Illness:
40yo female with a history of esophageal cancer s/p trach was
admitted from the ED with respiratory distress.
.
She has a tracheostomy in place due to esophageal cancer.
According to her family, she was exerting herself when she was
"air hungry." EMS presented and took the tracheostomy out and
noted a small plug in the tracheostomy itself. Upon arrival to
the ED, 97.9, HR 119, 111/82, RR 19, and pulse ox 99% on 12L
trach mask. Her exam was notable for tachycardia only. Her labs
were notable for elevated WBC to 12.9, and her imaging was
notable for CXR with left-sided pneumonia. She received
levofloxacin 750mg IV x 1, vancomycin 1g IV x 1, zosyn 4.5g IV x
1, potassium chloride 40mEq x 1, and morphine 4mg IV x 1. She
was evaluated by thoracics who replaced her tracheostomy and
they recommended further evaluation for her pneumonia.

Past Medical History:
- Metastatic esophageal Cancer
  ---> EGD - [**2130-6-1**] that was successful on the third attempt
and tissue biopsy at that time revealed an invasive squamous
cell carcinoma.
  ---> [**2130-7-13**] - started on Cetuximab with concurrent radiation.
She completed her radiation therapy on [**2130-8-24**] for a total of
6600 Gy. She also completed her Erbitux therapy at that time.
  ---> [**12-4**] She was admitted with nausea and vomiting and found
to have evidence of tracheal obstruction. In addition, she had a
CT of her neck, which was concerning for perforation. Thoracics
was consulted and felt that she would benefit from a
tracheostomy for airway protection, which was placed on
[**2130-12-8**]. She tolerated this well. She was noted to have a left
upper lobe cavitary lesion on the CT scan. She underwent a wedge
resection on [**2130-1-11**], which revealed carcinomatous plaques on
the pleural wall. This was confirmed to be a metastatic disease
on frozen section. In terms of her tracheostomy, she was
decannulated on [**2131-1-17**]. During the hospitalization she was
treated for pharyngeal abscess and had issues with tachycardia
as well as hypotension. She was discharged home on [**2131-1-19**].
  ---> [**2131-3-13**] - began a palliative chemotherapy regimen of 5-FU
and carboplatin on [**2131-3-13**].
- anemia.
- J tube placed by surgery via an open procedure in [**4-4**]
- constipation
- hypercalcemia
- tachycardia of unknown etiology
- tracheostomy
    ---->[**12-4**] - Tracheostomy placed due to supraglottic edema
in the setting of esophageal perforation
    ----> [**3-5**] - Tracheostomy placed due to vocal cord paralysis
and stridor

[**2131-5-2**] CXR: 1. Left lower lobe pneumonia with subjacent
effusion.
2. No definite tracheostomy tube is seen. Recommend clinical
correlation.

[**2131-5-2**] CXR: Interval placement of a tracheostomy tube. Left
basilar effusion, pneumonia, unchanged.

[**2131-5-6**] CT C/A/P w contrast: 1. Interval increase in size of
left pleural effusion and associated atelectasis. 2. Increase in
size and number of cavitary masses in the lungs bilaterally,
consistent with progression of metastatic disease. 3. Distended
gallbladder without evidence of acute cholecystitis. 4. 2-mm
non-obstructing left renal calculus.

[**2131-5-7**] J-tube change:

jejunostomy tube is ready to use.

[**2131-5-14**] LUE US:
IMPRESSION: No evidence of left upper extremity DVT.
Technically limited comparison of the right subclavian which
showed normal
color flow although venous waveform was not demonstrated.

[**2131-5-15**] CTA:
IMPRESSION:
1. Near complete venous obliteration at the level of the
junction of the left subclavian vein/left brachiocephalic vein,
by invasion of adjacent pleural mass. Please note that the
arterial structures including the left subclavian artery are
patent.
2. Interval worsening of left lung consolidation. Left lower
lobe bronchi is filled with secretion.
3. Edema of subcutaneous tissues of left chest.
4. No significant interval change in the thickness of
circumferential pleural mass with loculated pleural effusion.
5. No significant change in the focal consolidations and
cavitary lesions in the right lung.
6. Multiple osteolytic lesions in the left side ribs from local
invasion.

[**2131-5-23**]: J-tube change:

[**2131-5-26**]: J-tube check:
IMPRESSION: Jejunostomy tube terminates within the bowel with no
extravasation noted.


Brief Hospital Course:
40F ([**Location 7972**] Portuguese speaking only) with metastatic
esophageal cancer c/b respiratory failure requiring trach
admitted initially with respiratory distress due to mucous
plugging as well as hypercalcemia. Her course was complicated by
progressive lung mets on the left resulting in
subclavian/brachiocephalic venous obstrution causing left facial
edema. She was made DNR. She receeved treatment for HAP with
persistent hypercalcemia and worsening facial edema due to
compression of vessels by her tumor. She worsened clinically and
goals of care ultimately were focused on her comfort. She passed
away with her family at her bedside after several days of
progressive cognitive and respiratory decline.

#. Esophageal Cancer: Per her primary oncologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], she
would not benefit from further chemo. [**Hospital **] hospice care as an
inpatient with Abx, feedings, and steroids as appropriate.
Palliative care consulted actively in her care. Patient made
DNR/DNI after discussion held on [**5-25**] between Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] from
palliative care and the patient's husband. Pt pulled out Jtube
[**2131-5-31**]. A 14Fr foley was placed in the Jtube tract as a bridge
to repeat Jtube placement at IR. Jtube replaced [**2131-6-4**] at IR.

# Enteric - vesicular fistula: After Jtube replacement on [**2131-6-5**]
Pt developed bilious output from her vagina. Concern for
entero-vaginal fistula so injected methylene blue into the Jtube
at 0945AM on [**2131-6-7**]. Seems to be hav
