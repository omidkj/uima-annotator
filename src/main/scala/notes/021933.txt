Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 594**]
Chief Complaint:
Tracheostomy Tube Displacement

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Percutaneous Tracheostomy by IP [**2107-6-22**]

History of Present Illness:
67F w h/o schizoaffective d/o, DM, HTN, chronic respiratory
failure, tracheal stenosis now sp trach/peg presents from [**Hospital1 1501**]
after accidentally pulling out her trach this AM. Denied any SOB
or difficulty breathing, although endorsed some "noisy
breathing" while in the ED.  Patient currently protecting airway
and was speaking in full sentences in the ED.  Pt has a history
of subglottic stenosis since [**2103**] with multiple trach tube
changes and granulation tissue noted around the tube.  Of note
she has had several episodes of the trach being pulled out.

In the ED initial VS were T97.9 HR60 BP144/92 RR20 SpO2 100% 2L,
noted to be speaking in full sentences and AOx3, and also had
stridor per report and transmitted upper airway noises on lung
exam.  IP consulted in ED and bedside replacement of trach was
attempted however there was tooo much bleeding.  She went to OR
for replacement of tube in her tract, but too much granulation
tissue was present to introduce the tube.  Attempts were made to
dilate the stoma and to place tracheostomy tube with guidance of
fiberoptic bronchoscopy but unable to place.  She was intubated
in the OR with ETT for airway protection with plans to return to
OR in AM for rigid bronchoscopy and percutaneous tracheostomy.

On arrival to MICU, patient is intubated and sedated, not
responding to stimulation or comands.   Of note Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] of IP
has been recommending tracheal resection and reconstruction in
the past but patient has refused.

Past Medical History:
1. Respiratory failure requiring intubation, followed by failure
to wean, requiring tracheostomy.
2. Post-intubation tracheal stenosis, requiring chronic
tracheostomy.
3. Subglottic stenosis causing nearly 90% occlusion of the
airway status post rigid bronchoscopy, tracheal dilatation and
redo percutaneous tracheostomy on [**2106-10-12**].
4. Type 2 diabetes mellitus, insulin dependent.
5. Chronic pain disorder.
6. Schizoaffective disorder.
7. Depression.
8. Hypertension.
9. Glaucoma.
10. Cataracts bilaterally.
.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:
1. Trach and PEG placement initially in [**2105-5-5**].
2. Rigid bronchoscopy, tracheal dilatation and redo percutaneous
tracheostomy on [**2106-10-12**].


Social History:
Prior to hospitalization for PNA in Summer [**2104**], the patient
lived alone in [**Location (un) 1294**]; she now lives at [**Hospital 44563**]
nursing home ([**Hospital1 **] system). She retired as a school teacher
(French and [**Doctor First Name 533**]). She smoked 2 ppd for 40 years.

Pertinent Results:
[**2107-6-22**]: CXR
ET tube is in standard position, tip is 2.7 cm above the carina.
 NG tube tip is in the stomach.  There are low lung volumes.
There is mild cardiomegaly.  There is mild vascular congestion.
There are minimal atelectases in the right lower lobe.  If any,
there is a small right pleural effusion.  The study and the
report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

Brief Hospital Course:
67 y.o. woman w/ a history of post-intubation tracheal stenosis,
s/p multiple IP procedures, who presented with dislodged
tracheostomy tube now POD1 s/p percutaneous tracheostomy tube
placement.

# Dislodged tracheostomy tube:
She has dislodged her tube several time in the past. IP has
previously recommended tracheal resection and reconstruction
with thoracic surgery for definitive management but patient has
refused.  The initial attempt at bedside trach placement failed
in the ED w/ too much bleeding. She was then taken to the OR,
but there was too much granulation tissue present to place the
tube. Attempts were made to dilate the stoma and place the
tracheostomy tube under the guidance of fiberoptic bronchoscopy
but it was unable to be placed. Thus, in the OR she was
intubated for airway protection in preparation for another
attempt w/ a rigid bronchoscopy the next day. She was admitted
to the MICU. The next day, she was brought to the OR and
interventional pulmonology was able to place the percutaneous
tracheostomy tube under rigid bronchoscopy. She remained on the
ventilator on POD0 of the procedure given that she did not
tolerate CPAP well. She also became agitated after the
procedure, requiring restraints, Zyprexa, and lorazepam.
However, the next morning, she was calm and cooperative and was
able to be taken off the ventilator and transitioned to 10L
high-flow O2 for her trach. She was evaluated by speech and
swallow, and their recommendations were regular diet but the
CUFF ON THE TRACH TUBE NEEDS TO BE DOWN WHILE EATING. Also, she
cannot tolerate the valve for speaking at this time, so she will
need reevaluation at a later time at the nursing home.

# Diabetes:
At home, she is on lantus 58 units HS and standing prandial
insulin (12-12-8U regular insulin w/ meals and ISS). However,
since she was made NPO she was given 30U lantus and started on
ISS. Following speech and swallow evaluation, she was
transitioned back to her home insulin regimen.

#Hypokalemia:
She developed hypokalemia (K 3.3) in the post-op setting. This
was repleted according to the standard replacement scale.

#Hypophosphatemia:
She developed hypophosphatemia (2.4) in the post-op setting.
This was repleted according to the standard replacement scale.

#Leukocytosis:
She developed leukocytosis to 13.2 on POD1. This was likely due
to the stress of having a procedure. It is c/w her leukocytosis
she developed in the past in the same setting. She was not
started on any antibiotics or other treatment for this.

#Anemia:
On POD1, her Hct dropped to 33.5 after being 38.4 the previous
day. There was minimal blood loss during the procedure, but
there was low concern for any active bleeds. She did receive
several L NS in between these readings, which may have
contributed to the decreased Hct, w/ her procedure causing an
acute rise in platelets and WBC, keeping all cell lines from
being down.

# CAD/Hypertension:
She was continued on home lisinopril, labetalol, amlodipine,
aspirin and atorvastatin until she was post-op, at which time
these medications were held since s
