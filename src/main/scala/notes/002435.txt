Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2782**]
Chief Complaint:
Right knee pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Right total knee arthroplasty
initiation of hemodialysis
placement of tunneled hemodialysis catheter


History of Present Illness:
From orthopedics:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] returns.  Her orthopedic history is well
documented.  The shots that I give her improve her symptoms
significantly, so that she can walk around without pain.
Unfortunately, the pain returns.  It is the pain in her right
knee that is keeping her from ambulating as pain in the right
knee that is keeping her from doing all her activities of daily
living and it is the pain that keeps her intermittently in a
wheelchair.  She also has chronic lower back issues, which hurt
as well.

[**Hospital Unit Name 92800**]:
69 yo F with CKD stage 4, CAD with CABG, morbid obesity, who was
admitted for right TKR, s/p TKR on [**2131-11-12**], transferred to
the [**Year (4 digits) **] floor given [**Last Name (un) **] on CKD and volume overload.

Per report, patient had a right TKR on [**2131-11-12**].  Per
orthopedics, patient would need to be on Lovenox for DVT/PE
prophylaxis in the setting of recent TKR.  They were concerned
about patient's cardiac function and underlying CAD.

Med Consult was consulted POD2 given hypoxia, decreased uop, and
acute on chronic renal disease.  Patient was noted to require 3L
of O2 from a baseline of only intermittent 1-2 L NC.  Patient
was feeling very fatigued.  Patient was noted to be 6.7 L net
positive on [**2131-11-14**].  She was ultimately transferred to the
[**Year (4 digits) **] Hospitalist Service for further management.  It was
thought that patient was volume overloaded.  Nephrology was
consulted on [**2131-11-15**] for acute on chronic kidney disease and
thought that patient should continue with diuresis.

MICU consult was called on [**2131-11-16**] given altered mental
status.  Patient was noted to be lethargic on [**2131-11-15**] in the
setting of getting diuresis, pain medications, and home
gabapentin.  Her pain medications were stopped.  She was found
to be sobbing in the morning of [**2131-11-15**] from pain at the
surgical site.  Patient was given 2.5 mg po oxycodone and 160 mg
IV lasix and metolazone.  She was then found to be somnolent and
difficult to arouse from the sternal rub.  When evaluated
patient's vitals were 97.8, 107/50, 69, 20, 96% on 2L NC
(although the oxygen was not turned on upon my entering to the
room).
