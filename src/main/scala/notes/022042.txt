Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 348**]
Chief Complaint:
hypoxia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Endotracheal intubation
Transesophageal echocardiogram
Femoral central line


History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 13170**] is a 64 year old female with medical history
pertinent for FSGS s/p renal transplantation on
immunosuppression, history of squamous cell Lung CA s/p RLL
resection, history of aspergillus PNA who now presents with
symptoms of worsening dyspnea and hypoxia. The patient is noted
at baseline to have dyspnea for which she has previously
undergone evaluation. She has had PFTs revealing restrictive
phystiology. She has had a stress test in2007 that revealed
normal perfusion and an Echocardiogram last performed in [**2140**]
that revealed preserved EF.
.
ED Course: On arrival to the ED patient had vitals o f95.8,
65/45, 63, 18 89% on 6L NC. In the ED the patient was with O2
sats in the 80s on room air. Given hypotension pressors were
started including Dopamine, Dobutamine and Neo. The patient was
seen by cardiology with concern for possible tamponase. A
bedside echocardiogram was performed which did not reveal
effusion but did reveal new severe MR and possible [**Year (4 digits) 99125**].
Recommendation was made to discontinued pressors as likely
exacerbating hypotension and admit the patient to MICU for
further evaluation. The patient received Levofloxacin,
Ceftriaxone, and Vancomycin as well as 3L NS prior to transfer.

Imaging:
[**2144-3-2**]: Chest Portable
Despite differences in technique, the heart size
appears slightly larger than on the prior study. There is upper
zone vascular redistribution with Kerley B lines noted.
Postoperative changes in the right lung appear stable. No
definite pleural effusions are visualized. Dystrophic
calcification in the axillary regions bilaterally appears
stable.
IMPRESSION: Findings suggestive of mild interstitial pulmonary
edema
superimposed on chronic post-surgical changes in the right
hemithorax as above.

IMPRESSION: Worsening of a now moderate-to-severe pulmonary
edema. No
evidence of pneumothorax.

Brief Hospital Course:
Assessment/Plan:
.
#. Hypoxia - at baseline patient has been evaluated for
longstanding dyspnea without obvious cause. However, hypoxia on
admission new. Bedside echo in ED was concerning for severe MR
as well as possible [**Month/Day/Year 99125**] as contributors. Chest imaging looks
more consistent with pulmonary edema rather than infectious,
although important to consider latter given patient is
immunocompromised.  Repeat echo the following day when off
pressors with different findings as detailed below.  The sum of
her presentation and course was most consistent with cardiogenic
source.  Antibiotics (ceftriaxone/levoflox) were discontinued.
PCP and urine legionella were negative as well. Oxygenation
dramatically improved and she was extubated on [**3-3**]. Persantine
MIBI was negative.
.
#. Hypotension - etiology not clear although initially thought
to be related to new severe MR [**First Name (Titles) 151**] [**Last Name (Titles) 99125**]. However, repeat echo
off pressors showed only [**11-27**]+ MR with some LVH.  Cardiology was
consulted.  She maintained excellent blood pressures off
pressors. Again thought to be related to transient poor cardiac
output, the reason for which (ischemia vs. obstruction) was
unclear.
.
#. Squamous Cell Lung CA - s/p resection sup seg of RLL, no
known recurrence to date.
.
#. FSGS - s/p 3 renal transplants. Sirolimus, prednisone, and
bactrim were continued.  The renal transplant team followed her
while admitted.  Sirolimus levels were monitored.  Creatinine
initially above baseline and improved throughout course.
.
#. Anemia - currently at baseline, likely secondary to renal and
chronic disease
.
#. SVT - history of SVT, currently in NSR.  Held Warfarin given
INR at upper limits and possible need for instrumentation,
should be restarted.
.
#. Hyperlipidemia - continued statin
.
#. DM - on insulin sliding scale.
