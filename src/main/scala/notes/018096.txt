Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1481**]
Chief Complaint:
wound infection, intra-abdominal abscess

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
CT guided drainage of abscess with pigtail drain placement


History of Present Illness:
17 M s/p appendectomy at [**Hospital3 2737**] on [**2-17**] for
perforated appendicitis. The patient recovered well and had an
initial improvement in his symptoms and leukocytosis. On POD2
the
patient started experiencing worsening abdominal pain, nausea
and
vomiting and was transferred to the OSH ICU where a CT was
obtained showing postoperative changes and continued
inflammation
but no clear abscess. He was taken to the operating room for a
exploratory laporotomy on [**2-21**] where, per report, an enterotomy
or
perforation was identified in the terminal ileum. An ileal
resection was performed and an end ileostomy was placed, and the
patient was taken to the ICU for further recovery. Following the
procedure the patient continued to have abdominal pain and
increasing leukocytosis up to [**Numeric Identifier 3301**]. His midline laparotomy
wound
was opened [**1-22**] wound infection. The patient had been receiving
Zosyn and Flagyl and was then switched to Imipenem per ID
recommendation. A repeat CT was obtained on [**2-27**] and
demonstrated
multiple fluid collections and the patient was transferred to
[**Hospital1 18**] for further management.

CT abd/pel ([**3-5**]):
IMPRESSION:

1. Two discrete collections are again visualized throughout the
abdomen and pelvis. The previously aspirated, but not drained
collection along the right paracolic gutter appears relatively
unchanged with a focus of air consistent with prior
instrumentation. The right lower quadrant collection with
extension to pelvis which was aspirated and had a drain placed
appears smaller with resolution of the lateral and superficial
portion of the collection anterior to the right psoas muscle.

2. Moderate left pleural effusion, which is increased in size in
comparison to prior study with adjacent atelectasis. Small right
pleural effusion with adjacent atelectasis.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 89930**] was transferred to our trauma surgical intensive
care unit from [**Hospital3 **] early in the AM of [**2110-2-28**]. He
was seen by Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **] and his team, and based on the fluid
collections seen on OSH CT scan, he was sent to IR for
percutaneous drainage. The IR team aspirated the right paracolic
gutter collection and left a drain in the pelvic collection.
This fluid was sent for culture. The patient was initially
tachycardic upon admission to the ICU, but was otherwise
hemodynamically stable. He was transferred to the floor on HD4
in good condition.

Neuro: His pain was initially well controlled on intermittent IV
dilaudid. When tolerating po intake, the patient was switched to
vicodin, which was well tolerated.

CV: He arrived tachycardic with stable blood pressure. This
improved quickly during his hospital stay, and he had no other
issues.

Resp: He had significant oxygen demand upon arrival and CXR
showed bilateral effusions and atelectasis. Sputum cultures were
drawn that were insufficient. Patient was concurrently being
treated with vancomycin and meropenem for his intra-abdominal
abscesses, which was determined to be sufficient for presumed
pneumonia as well. The patient was also given intermittent lasix
to improve his respiratory status as his lungs looked fluid
overloaded. These effusions were followed with serial CXRs and
improved throughout his stay. He was weaned off of oxygen on the
floor and his breathing remained comfortable.

GI/GU/FEN: The patient was initially NPO/IVF upon admission. His
diet was advanced to regular by HD3 and this was well tolerated.
Ostomy output was nearly 2 liters the first 24 hours of
admission. The output remained high the first few days of his
hospital stay, but then decreased on its own to an appropriate
level without medical intervention. His electrolytes and fluid
status were closely monitored and patient was repleted as
needed. His open abdominal wound was treated with wet/dry
dressing changes TID, and showed continued healing and
improvement during his stay.

ID: He was seen by our ID team upon arrival who recommended
switching imipenem to meropenem. He was also started on
vancomycin at arrival for presumed PNA. His abdominal wound was
packed with wet to dry dressings. Abdominal fluid collections
showed vanc sensitive enterococcus and [**Female First Name (un) **], so fluconazole
was added as well. The patient was kept on this antibiotic
regimen during his hospital stay. PICC line was placed on [**3-3**]
to continue atbx as an outpatient. Repeat CT scan was performed
on [**3-5**] that showed persistent abscesses in the pelvis and R
pericolic gutter. However, after patient's drain was adequately
flushed, the drain began to put out purulent material. Radiology
felt the drain was in good position and did not need to be
re-adjusted. The patient was sent home on meropenem, vancomycin,
and fluconazole per ID's recommendations.
Prophylaxis: Patient was started on SQH and encouraged to
ambulate often.

Dispo: Patient received ostomy teaching, Picc line teaching, and
wound care teaching. He understood all of this and agreed with
the plan. He was given discharge instructions and told to keep
all follow up appointments as scheduled.
