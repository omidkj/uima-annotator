the patient's heart rate was 58 (sinus bradycardia), his
blood pressure was 110/70, his respiratory rate was 20,
height was 5 feet 8 inches, and his weight was 183 pounds.

PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:  White blood
cell count was 9.4, his hematocrit 39.3, and his platelets
were 205.  His INR was 1.3.  Sodium was 141, potassium was
4.1, chloride was 102, bicarbonate was 31, blood urea
nitrogen was 20, creatinine was 1.2, and blood glucose was
79.

PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  A chest x-ray was without any

CONCISE SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  As stated previously,
the patient was a direct admission to the operating room on
[**2-23**].

At that time, he had aortic valve replacement with a 27-mm
[**Last Name (un) 3843**]-[**Doctor Last Name **] pericardial valve.  Please see the
Operative Report for full details.  In summary, the patient
had an aortic valve replacement.  Bypass time was 153 minutes
with a cross-clamp time of 82 minutes.  The patient tolerated
the procedure well and was transferred from the operating
room to the Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit.

At the time of transfer, the patient was in a sinus rhythm
with a rate of 76 beats per minute.  His mean arterial blood
pressure was 63.  His central venous pressure was 7.  He had
nitroglycerin at 0.3 mcg/kg per minute and epinephrine at
0.025 mcg/kg per minute.  The patient did well in the
immediate postoperative period.  His anesthesia was reversed.
He was weaned from the ventilator and successfully extubated.
He remained hemodynamically stable throughout the day of his
surgery.

On postoperative day one, the patient continued to remain
hemodynamically stable.  He remained on a nitroglycerin
infusion for blood pressure control as well as an insulin
infusion for blood sugar control.  He was begun on beta
blockade and diuretics and was weaned from his nitroglycerin
infusion successfully after the initiation of an ACE
inhibitor as well.

On postoperative day two, the patient continued to be
hemodynamically stable.  He was transfused with one unit of
packed red blood cells.  His diuretics were continued, and
his chest tubes were discontinued at that time.  He was also
transferred from the Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit to
[**Hospital Ward Name 121**] Two for continued postoperative care and cardiac
rehabilitation.

Over the next several days, the [**Hospital 228**] hospital course was
uneventful.  With the assistance of the nursing staff and
Physical Therapy staff, his activity level was gradually
increased.  On postoperative day three, it was determined
that on the following day the patient would be stable and
ready to be transferred to rehabilitation for continued
postoperative care.

At that time, the patient's physical examination was as
follows.  Vital signs revealed his temperature was 99.3
degrees Fahrenheit, his heart rate was 87 (sinus rhythm), his
blood pressure was 112/60, his respiratory rate was 20, and
his oxygen saturation was 94% on room air.  Weight
preoperatively was 88 kilograms.  On discharge, his weight
was 93 kilograms.

Laboratory data revealed his white blood cell count was 10.1,
his hematocrit was 25.4, and his platelets were 101.  Sodium
was 137, potassium was 3.7, chloride was 102, bicarbonate was
28, blood urea nitrogen was 23, creatinine was 0.9, and blood
glucose was 99.

Physical examination revealed the patient was alert and
oriented times three.  He was moving all extremities.  He was
following commands.  Respiratory examination revealed
scattered rhonchi throughout.  Cardiovascular examination
revealed a regular rate and rhythm.  Normal first heart
sounds and second heart sounds.   No murmurs.  The sternum
was stable.  The incision with Steri-Strips opened to air and
clean and dry.  The abdomen was soft, nontender, and
nondistended.  There were normal active bowel sounds.  The
extremities were warm and well perfused with no edema.
