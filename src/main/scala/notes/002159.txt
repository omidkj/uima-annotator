CT scan showed subarachnoid hemorrhaging involving cisterns
and ventricles with hydrocephalus.

The patient was admitted to the Neurosurgical Intensive Care
Unit for close monitoring.  She also had a ventriculostomy
drain placed at the time of admission.

She was taken to the Angiography Suite and had a cerebral
angiogram which revealed a ruptured dissecting vertebral artery

extremities.

Repeat head CT on [**2115-12-5**], showed improving
hydrocephalus with no apparent infarct.  The patient was

and alert.  She had weakness of bilateral upper extremities
but was still moving times four.  She had a vent drain level
at 5 cm above the tragus.  She had TCDs which showed

On [**2115-12-8**], the patient's vent drain was raised to 10
cm above the tragus.  Her intravenous fluids were increased

physical therapy and Occupational Therapy on the floor and
found to require acute rehabilitation.  Her vitals signs
remained stable.  She remained neurologically stable.  She
