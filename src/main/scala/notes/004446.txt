sometimes with interscapular pain, presented to OSH with dyspnea
[**8-20**]. He denied CP, orthopnea, or PND. EKG revealed a fib,

CHEST: CTA B
CV: irregularly irreg, s1, III/VI late peaking systolic m, no s2

EXT: cool, dry, no cyanosis, clubbing, edema.
PULSES: 2+ radial, 1+ DP/PT bilaterally

Pertinent Results:
CXR [**9-1**]: 1. Worsening left lower lobe consolidation and
increasing small left pleural effusion. 2. Improved aeration in
the right lower lobe with minimal residual atelectasis and
decreased size of small left pleural effusion.
Cath [**8-22**]: 1. Coronary arteries are normal. 2. Severe aortic
stenosis. 3. Normal ventricular function.
Echo [**8-25**]: PRE-BYPASS: The left atrium is mildly dilated. There
is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%). There
are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. The aortic
valve leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. There is severe
aortic valve stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. There
is moderate thickening of the mitral valve chordae. Mild to
moderate ([**1-28**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. POST CPB:
Preserved [**Hospital1 **]-ventricular systolic function. On the [**Last Name (un) 27185**] attempt
at separation form CPB a 1.5 cm echo dense mass was seen in the
LA in the region of LAA. It was pedunculated and feeely mobile.
CPB was reinstituded and a large clot was removed via left
atriotomy. 2nd attempt: Preserved biventricular systolic
function. LAA was not visualized secondary to surgical
exclusiun. A bioprosthesis is seen in the aortic posiiton, well
seated and mecahnically stable. Trace AI.
CXR [**8-27**]: Comparison is made with a prior chest radiograph dated
[**2160-8-25**]. The patient is status post median sternotomy.
Previously noted endotracheal tube, Swan-Ganz catheter, chest
tubes, and mediastinal drainage tubes have been removed. There
is right IJ line terminating in upper SVC. There is no definite
pneumothorax. Again note is made of cardiomegaly and prominent
mediastinal contours. There is bibasilar atelectasis and small
effusion, unchanged since prior study. Left upper old rib
fracture.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 69468**] was transferred from OSH to [**Hospital1 18**] for presumed
valve surgery. She underwent a cardiac cath on [**8-22**] which
revealed severe aortic stenosis and normal coronaries. She then
underwent all pre-operative work-up. On [**8-25**] she was brought to
the operating room where she underwent an aortic valve
replacement and removal of a mass from left atrium. Please see
operative report for surgical details. Following surgery she was
transferred to the CSRU for invasive monitoring in stable
condition. Later on op day she was weaned from sedation, awoke
neurologically intact and extubated. She received blood
transfusion on op day and heart rhythm converted into atrial
fibrillation. Amiodarone was initiated. Heparin was started on
post-op day two and continued until his INR was therapeutic on
Coumadin. Also on this day his chest tubes were removed. Beta
blockers and diuretics were started and he was gently diuresed
towards his pre-op weight. On post-op day three he was
transferred to the SDU. He remained stable over the next several
days waiting for his INR to increase and become therapeutic. On
post-op day seven he was found to have some sternal drainage and
antibiotics were initiated.  The sternal drainage resolved. His
INR was 2.2 and he was ready for discharge on [**2160-9-3**].
