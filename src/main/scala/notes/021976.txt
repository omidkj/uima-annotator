[**2191-9-1**]
NON-CONTRAST CT HEAD: The right frontal lobe demonstrates a
focus of
hyperintensity that is stable since [**01**] hours ago measuring 3.8 x
2.5 cm. There
is stable appearance of subarachnoid hemorrhage into the
interhemispheric
fissure with associated mild 7-mm left-to-right midline shift.
There are
areas of hyperdensity scattered within the right occipital lobe
consistent
with subarachnoid hemorrhage, unchanged. Moderate bifrontal
edema, right
greater than left is unchanged. An area of hypodensity along the
right
temporal/occipital lobe likely represents a late subacute
infarct, unchanged.

IMPRESSION:
1. Stable appearance of right-sided frontal intraparenchymal
hemorrhage as
well as foci of subarachnoid hemorrhage.

2. No evidence of increased mass effect or hydrocephalus.

3. Hypodense area along the right temporooccipital lobe likely
represents a
late subacute infarct and appears unchanged since [**01**] hours ago.

[**2191-8-30**]
CT CHEST: The right lung demonstrates a large pleural effusion.
There are
scattered foci of increased density in the lung with a 1.2 x 1.3
cm lesion
with spiculated margins in the right upper lobe (2:33). There is
extensive
paraseptal and centrilobular emphysema in both lungs. The left
lung is
otherwise grossly unremarkable without evidence of effusion,
except to note
several sub-4-mm nodules which should be followed in the left
lower lobe
(2:23, 24). The aorta is of normal course and caliber
throughout, with
extensive calcifications noted. There is moderate-to- severe
coronary
atherosclerosis, most severe in the left anterior descending
artery. A right
subclavian catheter terminates in the right atrium. A dual- lead

intraventricular pacemaker is noted with its leads overlying the
right
ventricle and right atrium. There is no evidence of pericardial
effusion.

CT ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST: The liver demonstrates marked
intra- and extra-
hepatic biliary dilatation, with the CBD measuring up to 12mm.
The pancreatic
duct is also dilated diffusely, measuring up to 5-6 mm. The
remainder of the
pancreas and adrenals appear unremarkable. The kidneys
demonstrate scattered
sub-6-mm hypodensities that likely represent simple cysts,
although are too
small to be characterized. The spleen demonstrates a sub-3-cm
fluid collection
(approximately 46 Hounsfield units) that may represent a
perisplenic hematoma
or adjacent focal fluid. No splenic laceration noted. The intra-
abdominal
loops of large and small bowel are grossly unremarkable without
evidence of
free fluid, free air, or pneumatosis.

CT PELVIS: The rectum, uterus and adnexa are grossly
unremarkable except to
note calcifications in the uterus which may represent calcified
fibroids.
There is extensive sigmoid diverticulosis without evidence of
diverticulitis.
The lower ureters are grossly unremarkable. There is ectasia and
focal
aneurysm at the bifurcation of the common iliac arteries (2:81).


Bone windows demonstrate a right intertrochanteric fracture with
valgus
angulation. There is a compression fracture with near-complete
height loss at
L1 of unknown chronicity. There are no suspicious lytic or
blastic lesions,
although there are moderate-to-severe degenerative changes noted
throughout
the thoracolumbar spine. No rib fractures noted.

IMPRESSION:

1. Large right pleural effusion.

2. Extensive emphysematous changes with a 1.3-cm spiculated
lesion within the
right lung which is suspicious for a neoplasm. Dedicated chest
CT when the
patient is clinically stable is recommended for further
evaluation.

3. Marked dilation of the intra- and extra-hepatic biliary ducts
and common
bile duct as well as pancreatic duct. No pancreatic head mass
identified.
Comparison with outside previous studies is recommended. If
these studies are
not available, then MRCP is recommended when the patient is
clinically stable.

4. Right comminuted intertrochanteric fracture with valgus
angulation.

5. L1 compression fracture of unknown chronicity.

6. Ectasia of the bilateral common iliac arteries.

7. Extensive emphysema.

8. Small perisplenic, mildly complex fluid collection.
