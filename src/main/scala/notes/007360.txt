had a left main stem wire stent placed.  Her symptoms have
persisted since then including severe dyspnea on exertion,
inability to clear secretions and episodes of dyspnea daily,
which almost resulted in syncopal episodes.  Her dyspnea
leads to experiences of lightheadedness, gasping for air
before she regains enough control of her breathing to allow
for her to improve.  She has been on Levofloxacin and Biaxin
chronically for her bronchitis.  Over the last several years
her episodes of bronchitis and presyncopal symptoms have
progressed in frequency.

bronchus was opened and the left stent was also visualized
with a distal opening and some mild granulation tissue in the
proximal end.  Numerous washings were performed for
bacteriology, culture and sensitivity was sent.  She
recovered without complications.

She is currently being admitted for right thoracotomy and
tracheobronchoplasty.
