Chief Complaint:
brought in [**12-26**] valproic acid o/d

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
n/a

History of Present Illness:
HPI: 42 yo M w/ h/o HIV, bipolar disorder who initially
presented following valproic acid overdose on [**2182-6-1**]. The day
PTA, the patient was found on the floor, lying conscious and
alert, having drunk 1/2 L Bicardi, and reportedly swallowed 90
lorazepam tablets and an unknown number of depakote tablets. The
home was "trashed" with "blood everywhere." No reported LOC. He
had been part of recent 20 yr relationship with partner, had
been making homicidal/suicidal threats.
.
Initially presented combative and disoriented. Head CT, Abd CT
(-); CT C-spine showed no signs of acute injury. Intubated for
airway protection given altered mental status and
combatitiveness. During the intubation, significant edema of
upper airway was noted.  Max VPA level noted in low 200's
(therapeutic <150), BZD urine/blood (-).
.
The MICU stay was complicated by RLL/RML aspiration pna which
grew MRSA in the sputum and BAL, s/p levo/clinda/vanc,
[**Date range (1) 109654**]. (Vanc [**6-4**]-current, levo/clinda [**Date range (1) 109655**]). Unasyn x
2 days was given for sinusitis noted on CT scan performed [**12-26**]
persistent fever ([**Date range (1) 87437**]). No growth on BCx. Pt has remained
persistently febrile spiking w/o pattern but at least daily, to
as high as 106F. TTE was performed as initial eval for
endocardititis, TEE performed on floor, both negative.  Abd
imaging without any collections or source of fevers.  Head MR
performed to r/o hypothalmic lesion.

Readmitted to MICU for fever, rigors, fluid-resistant
hypotension- T= 102-104 w/ systolic bp 80s, tachycardic to 120.
Rec'd intermittent NS boluses (total of 4L) w/ some
non-sustained improvement in bp.  Repeat LP performed w/o
evidence of meningitis.

Brief Hospital Course:
A: 42 yoM w/ HIV presents s/p fall following lorazepam/depakote
OD
.
1) MRSA PNA/cavitation: The patient was intubated in the E.D.
for airway protection.  During intubaton and later in MICU,
witnessed aspiration.  CXR [**6-3**] and on chest CT on [**6-6**] revealed
right upper and lower lobe consolidation c/w  pneumonia.  Chest
CT [**6-7**] showed RUL/RLL pna which grew MRSA in the sputum and
BAL, s/p levo/clinda/vanc, [**Date range (1) 109654**]. (Vanc [**Date range (1) 109656**]
levo/clinda [**Date range (1) 109655**]). Unasyn x 2 days was given for sinusitis,
[**Date range (1) 29812**]. No growth on BCx.  Demonstrated good tolerance of
CPAP/PS with adequate oxygenation and ventilation while sedated.
 Fever: As the pt was being weaned from the ventilator, he began
experiencing high fevers (102-106).  These continued after the
patient was weaned from the vent and continued during his brief
sojurn to the floor.  During the time the pt received an
extensive work-up including multiple cultures, CT of the
abdomen, chest, and sinuses, MRI, tte and tee, multiple lumbar
punctures on the floor, and a tagged WBCC scan, all of which
failed to localize a source.  On [**6-19**], a repeat cxr noted RUL
cavitary lesion and patient underwent CT scan for further
evaluation.  CT revealed evolving approx 1cm x 1cm cavitary
lesion of RUL lobe w/ resolving surrounding cavitation.  The
patient was started on vanco/clinda/ceftaz at this time (had
previously been maintained on vancomycin and unasyn, prior
course during ICU stay had included vanco/ceftaz).  Vancomycin
was dosed more aggressively with goal troughs of 15, and the
patient defervesced within 48 hours and remained afebrile
throughout the remainder of his ICU admission.  CT surgery was
consulted and felt the lesion was not amenable to either perc
drainage or surgical intevention.  Plan to complete 5 wk course
of antibiotics.  It was recommended that the patient have a
follow-up C
