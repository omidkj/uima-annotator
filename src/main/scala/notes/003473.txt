Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1505**]
Chief Complaint:
Asymptomatic with Aortic Aneurysm


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Replacement of ascending aorta and hemiarch [**2116-6-29**]


History of Present Illness:
41 year old asymptomatic pleasant female with a history of
bicuspid aortic valve, first diagnosed 20 years ago, followed by
serial echocardiograms. Echo done at [**Hospital3 **] in
[**2114**]
showed dilated proximal aorta dilated at 4.6-4.7cm. Another echo
was performed on [**2116-5-21**] which showed likely bicuspid valve with
mild to moderate aortic regurgitation. The aorta was aneurysmal
with ascending aorta measured at 5cm. She then underwent a chest
CT which showed the aortic root to be aneurysmal at 4.9x4.2cm
and
ascending aorta at 5.2x4.9cm. She currently denies any symptoms
of chest pain, shortness of breath, orthopnea or edema. Due to
the current and increase in size of aneurysm, she presents
for second opinion regarding surgical replacement of aorta.

Conclusions
PRE BYPASS No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in
the body of the left atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of
the right atrium/right atrial appendage. No atrial septal defect
is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses and cavity size are normal. Regional left
ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50%). The right
ventricular cavity is dilated with normal free wall
contractility. The ascending aorta is moderately dilated. The
dilation occurs just a few centimeters above the sinotubular
junction. The upper extent of the anuerysm can not be
determined. There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic
aorta. The aortic valve appears to have 3 leaflets congenitally
but the left and right cusps appear fused resulting in a
functionally bicuspid valve. The aortic valve leaflets are
mildly thickened . There is no aortic valve stenosis. Mild to
moderate ([**12-1**]+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Physiologic mitral regurgitation
is seen (within normal limits). Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in
person of the results in the operating room at the time of the
study.

POST BYPASS The patient is atrially paced. There is normal
biventricular systolic function. The ascending aortic aneurysm
has been resected but that portion of the aorta can not be seen
very well. The aortic valve remains as in the pre-bypass study.
However, the aortic regurgitation appears somewhat improved, now
mild, and is eccentrically directed towards the anterior mitral
valve leaflet. The descending thoracic aorta and aortic arch
appear intact after decannulation.


Brief Hospital Course:
On [**2116-6-29**] Ms.[**Known lastname 57141**] went to the operating room and underwent
Resection of the ascending aortic aneurysm, replacement of the
ascending aorta with a 28-mm
Gelweave tube graft. Cross Clamp time=37 minutes.
Cardiopulmonary Bypass time=56 minutes. Please see operative
report for further surgical details. She tolerated the procedure
well and was transferred to the CVICU intubated and sedated on
Propofol and Neo. She awoke neurologically intact and was
extubated without difficulty. She weaned off pressor and was
started on Beta-blocker/Statin/Aspirin and diuresis. All lines
and drains were discontinued per protocol. POD# 2 she was
transferred to the step down unit for further monitoring.
Physical Therapy was consulted for evaluation of strength and
mobility. The remainder of her postoperative course was
essentially uneventful. POD# 4 she was cleared for discharge to
home with VNA. All follow up appointments were advised.
