CT HEAD WITHOUT CONTRAST: No intracranial hemorrhage, mass
effect, shift of normally midline structures, or major vascular
territorial infarct is apparent. The density values of the brain
parenchyma appear within normal limits. Size of ventricles,
sulci, and cisterns is within normal limits. Mucosal thickening
is seen in several ethmoid air cells, one of which contains an
air-fluid level. The mastoid air cells are clear. Bony
structures and surrounding soft tissue structures appear
unremarkable.

IMPRESSION: No evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage.

Brief Hospital Course:
Drug overdose - Pt reports starting to use opiates (heroin) 7
yrs ago [**1-5**] chronic
low back pain. After several yrs, he lost his house and
commercial truck. While being homeless, pt started to attend
methadone clinic and reports being on 120 mg of methadone
(confirmed by calling them). Pt continued to experience pain and
felt that methadone was not sufficiently covering his pain.
That's why, he started to add
benzodiazepines (Xanax, [**12-5**] bar shaped, unknown dose) which
hewas buying on the streets. Day before admission, pt bought
small blue pills. He believed that those Xanax pills have lower
dose and took between 5 or 10 pills. Pt denied suicidal intent.
Additionally, pt reported being increasingly depressed x at
least2 yrs (after loosing his truck): he was increasingly
tearful,sad, anxious, worried about future. +decreased sleep,
decrease ofappetite and loosing weight (from to 230 to 187 lbs).
He admits
feeling helpless and hopeless. Month ago, he was told THough, he
denies any direct thoughts to kill himself, he admitted to not
caring about his life. He also says, "I will be dead if they
(BAyCove) kick me out". Pt denies aver seeing psychiatrist or
being admitted to psychiatric hospital. He tried to go to [**Hospital1 1680**]
but was not
admitted and did not see psychiatrist. He denies any hx of
suicide attempts.

He was in acute resp failure from the drug overdose. Tolerated
extubation well and then was transferred to the floor. He was
alert and oriented but depressed. Psych did not feel he needed
any sitter. They offered him dual diagnosis Rx but he did not
accept this. On initial EG - QTc interval was prolonged. This
was likely from the drug effect esp methadone. Pain service was
involed and the regimen was changed with decreasing dose of
methadone and starting other pain meds to counteract the pain
and to minimize dose of methadone. His pain was well controlled
at discharge, he was given enough Rx till he sees his new PCP at
[**Name9 (PRE) 191**] and he was advised to go back to the methadone program. They
were informed of the change in dose of methadone.

He had low grade fevre a day before dc, no clear inf source
found.

He was advised to continue to either follow at [**Hospital1 2177**] for h/o lung
cancer or talk to his new PCP here at [**Hospital1 18**] for transferring
care.
