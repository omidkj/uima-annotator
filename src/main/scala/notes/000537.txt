History of Present Illness:
Mrs. [**Known firstname 40107**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 40108**] is a 76 year-old woman with HTN, HL,
hypothyroidism, h/o strokes with dementia who was found to have
acute renal failure at Rehab and was sent to our ED for
evaluation, but developped tachycardia an hypotension. She was
in her prior state of health until aproximately 8-9 weeks ago
when she started to be progressively tired, weak and not able to
take care of herself. She was driving and managing all her ADLs.
She made one of her long-time friends her HCP given she has no
family. One day she was unable to walk from one room to another
and she was taken to our ED on [**2192-4-13**]. She was diagnosed with
chronic aspiration and a Zenker's diverticula and was placed on
TPN. She was discharged to  [**Hospital **] Rehab ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 40109**]) on
[**2192-4-18**] where she had been able to walk, interactive, chatting
and doing well. Plans were to bring her back to fix the
diverticulum. There were discussions about fixxing it with
endoscopic techniques. She also developped a PNA that was
treated with 10-day course of Vancomycin/CTX (last day [**2192-5-4**]).
The course was finished at Rehab.
.
During the last week she has been progressively confused. She
keeps talking about her husband [**Name (NI) 40110**] her (who died 5 years
ago). Yesterday when at rehab they noted that she started to be
very "anxious" and confused. Normally, she can follow commands
and is oriented x2 (person and place). She started to pull her
oxygen off her face and be less verbally responsive. Labs were
drawn and they noted acute renal failure (creatinine of 1.7) at
Rehab and decided to send her to our hospital for evaluation.
She was febrile to [**Age over 90 **] yesterday at Rehab per nursing report.
She was being treated for pneumonia with levofloxacin. On her
way to our ED she developped AFIb with RVR and became
hypotensive.

In our ED her initial VS were FS=113, 97.4 138 105/72 24 95%
NRB. She was oriented in self and mildly agitated. She had a
clonidine patch on that was removed. She was screaming "Help".
Her lungs were clear. Her CXR showed a multi-focal PNA in the
right lung. She was "broadened" to Vancomycin 1g IV/Levofloxacin
750 mg (got at rehab today the later). Her HCP was [**Name (NI) 653**] and
made aware that patient was here. The DNR was confirmed, but
CVLs would be ok (per ED resident's conversation). Her initial
labs were significant for: WBC 18.3 with N:90 Band:0 L:4 M:6 E:0
Bas:0, H&H of 7.9/25, PLTs 307, Ca: 7.9 Mg: 2.6 P: 4.1, Na 156,
3.7, Cl 123, CO2 23, BBUN 97, Cr 1.9, glucose 95, Lactate:1.9.
Blood and urine cultures wre sent. Her ECG showed AFib with RVR
up to 150s. She also received ativan for unclear reasons,
calcium gluconate for her low calcium and diltiazem 10 mg IV for
rate control. Her initial BP dropped up to 70 SBP, but responded
to fluids. It has been ranging from 70-130. She has had only 40
cc of dark urine. She has a PICC line and an IV in the left
forearm. Foley catheter was placed. She got a total of 3 L NS
and 1 L NS with 40 mEq of KCl. Her urine output was ~400 cc.
