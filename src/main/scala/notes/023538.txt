History of Present Illness:
81 yo woman with PMH signficant for SLE, gout, CHF and MVR,
severe osteoporosis who was admitted on [**2131-10-11**] to [**Location (un) **]
[**Location (un) 1459**] from NH, c/o bilateral hip pain. She denied trauma but
had an overlying hematoma on the right side, however she does
not "recall anything" at this point. Plain x-rays showed
bilateral hip fractures, intratrochanteric on one side and
femoral neck on other. The patient was initially hypotensive to
the 80s but then responded to fluids. She was admitted to
Medicine due to medical comorbidity. Surgery was initally
planned for [**2131-10-16**] but on that day, she developed hypoxemia and
cyanosis and CXR showed pulmonary edema, so she was diuresed
with Lasix and Bumex and she did well though her O2 sats
remained in the high 90??????s on 2-3LNC. Cardiology and Pulmonary
were consulted. Pulmonary felt, that she likely has interstitial
underlying lung disease as well that is contributing to her
hypoxemia. Duonebs were given. She was continued on betablockers
for rate control but Coumadin was held. She was not on any other
form of DVT prophylaxis or anticoagulation. She was also found
to have a UTI from ESBL-E.coli and was treated with Zosyn. The
patient was also noted to be thrombocytopenic, chronically
around 65K which was attributed to SLE. Her anemia was ranging
around a Hgb 8.3-8.5. She was transfused 1 Unit PRBC??????s, Hct 27.9
prior to transfer. The patient also has ARF with an unclear
baseline (last 1.0 in [**2124**]) now Creatinine 1.2 per last report.

.
She was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2131-10-21**].  She was evaluated by
orthopaedics for operative repair of her hips.  She was assessed
to be fluid overloaded as part of her hypoxia.  Diuresis was
started.  There was concern about a PE, so a CTA was done on
[**10-22**] which showed no PE, but did show bilateral pleural
effusions with patchy ground glass opacities, apical
interlobular septal thickening and peripheral reticulation.
There was mediastinal and hilar adenopathy.
.
The decision was made to diurese further, and her oxygen
requirement was decreased from 3L to 1L nc.  She had a repeat UA
which showed E.coli that was sensitive to bactrim, so the zosyn
was changed to bactrim.
.
On [**10-24**] she was felt stable to go to the OR the following day
for possible surgical repair of both hips.  On [**10-25**] she was
taken to the OR and the left hip repair was started.  She was
noted to have a large amount of bleeding, and an intraopeartive
hct was 21% (from 30% the previous day).  She was given 3u PRBC
intraoperatively.  She was noted to have an arrhythmia vs ST
depressions on telemetry during this time.  The decision was
made to not proceed with the right hip at this time.
.
There was a postoperative attempt at extubation, which per
report she failed due to rising CO2.
.
At this time she is intubated, on a propofol gtt.

Physical Exam:
On Admission to MICU:

Physical exam:
VS T 99.0 BP 110/50 HR 70 RR 12 O2Sat 100% on AC 500x12 RR 12
40%
Ge: Intubated, sedated
HEENT: NC/AT, PERRLA, anicteric
NECK: no LAD, JVD at 8cm, no carotid bruit, left EJ in place
COR: S1S2, regular rhythm, no r/g, split 2, III/VI holosystolic
murmur over apex. No RV heave.
PULM: crackles about 1/3 up both lung fields anteriorlly.  No
wheeze.
ABD: + bowel sounds, soft, nd, nt
Skin: warm extremities, large hematoma over R knee, back not
examined.
EXT: 1+ DP, 2+ edema, swelling of b/l hip.  Left hip bandaged
with soft tissue swelling of thigh.  RLE shortened and
externally rotated.
GU: Perineal bruising / hematoma with swelling of left labia >
right labia.

Pertinent Results:
ECHO at OSH: Preserved LV function, R pulm HTN, RV enlargement,
TV 51mmHg
.
ECHO here: The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right
atrium is moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF>55%). The right ventricular cavity is dilated. Right
ventricular systolic function is borderline normal. [Intrinsic
right ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed
given the severity of tricuspid regurgitation.] The aortic valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is
seen. A bioprosthetic mitral valve prosthesis is present. The
transmitral gradient is normal for this prosthesis. No mitral
regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity
of mitral regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.]
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Severe [4+]
tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is severe pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2125-2-13**],
left ventricular systolic function appears preserved. Tricuspid
regurgitation is now more prominent and pulmonary artery
systolic pressure is now higher.
.
CTA: 1.  No evidence of pulmonary embolism. 2.  Bilateral
pleural effusions with patchy ground-glass opacity, apical
interlobular septal thickening, and peripheral reticulation.
Findings likely,
at least in part, reflect a degree of hydrostatic pulmonary
edema.  It is unclear what component of these changes are
chronic in nature.  If indicated, followup CT after the
patient's acute clinical findings have been treated may be
performed. 3. Numerous thoracic compression fractures, age
indeterminate. 4. Coronary artery and other vascular
calcifications consistent with atherosclerosis.  5.  Mediastinal
and hilar lymphadenopathy.
.
HIP Xray: 1.  Displaced right femur intratrochanteric fracture
with pins in situ. 2.  Left femur fracture.
.
CT HEAD: No acute intracranial pathology including no sign of
intracranial hemorrhage.
.
R Elbow: 2views: Radial head fracture
.
BNP: [**10-17**] 9000 at OSH

Admission EKG: Afib, V-paced, HR 70, ST scooping in I;
throughout three sequential EKG on [**12-15**]/[**10-17**] patient is
developing a TWI in isolated V2

Brief Hospital Course:
# B/l hip fractures [**1-12**] osteoporosis s/p repair:  The patient
was originally admitted with bilateral hip fractures, the left
newer than the right, of unclear origin as there was no known
trauma or fall. However, there was no suspicion of abuse and
social work confirmed this. After some respiratory optimization,
described below, and reversal of her INR with vitamin K and FFP,
the patient underwent a left hemiarthroplasty on [**10-25**].
Intraoperatively, some abnormal appearing changes, possible ST
depressions, appeared on her telemetry and the operation limited
to only the left side at that time. She was a difficult ween
from the ventilator and was transferred to the MICU for rule out
ACS and vent ween. She was ruled out by a normal EKG and 3 sets
of negative cardiac biomarkers. She also required several units
of PRBCs for postoperative anemia. She was extubated shortly
thereafter. She returned to the OR for a right ORIF and removal
