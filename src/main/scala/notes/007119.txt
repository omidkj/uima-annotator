History of Present Illness:
This 45 F with PMH incidentally discovered R MCA (M2)
aneurysm s/p coiling was admitted [**12-4**] after presenting that day
with 1 day of left hand pain, spasm, paresthesias and twitching.


On [**2128-12-2**], she developed a left occipital headache and slight
dysarthria.  She self-medicated w/ fioricet and compazine.  By
[**2128-12-3**], the headache waned but dysarthria persisted.  She
additionaly developed a weakness over her distal left arm which
evolved to include spasm and twitching.  She presented to OSH on
[**12-4**] and was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] where she was given
benzodiazepines for spasm and admitted to the neurology general
service in consideration for possible seizures.  On [**2128-12-5**], she
felt the spasm was improved and took a nap at 0930h.  On
awakening ~1h later, she felt her left arm was newly "heavy and
fat."  SBP 120s.  During attending exam, new left facial droop
and dysarthria were noted.  Stat CT/CTA/CTP performed, official
results of which are pending.  Prelimarily, no hemorrhage or
vessel occlusion but suggesting of slow flow in MCA/PCA
watershed
zone.

She developed <1minute left visual field cut; SBP 80s.  IVF
bolus
given and symptom resolved.

Brief Hospital Course:
45 y/o woman s/p coil and stent of R M2 (sup
division) [**2128-11-15**] originally admitted with left hand twitching
but who developed new flaccid hand weakness, slight facial droop
w/ dysarthria and agraphesthesia. Brain MRI showed hypodensity
in the right temporal lobe which was most suspicious for
infarction, given the vascular abnormalities nearby. CTA head
reveals no evidence of stenosis or occlusion. Patient's symptoms
improved. Patient was recommended to quit smoking and prescribed
nicotine patch and to continue taking plavix. She was also
recommended not to take ibuprofen.

Discharge Disposition:
Home With Service

Facility:
[**Company 1519**]

Discharge Diagnosis:
Right parietal ischemic stroke
Right MCA aneurysm, s/p coiling and stenting


Discharge Condition:
Stable, some persistent left hand weakness and numbness


Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to the hospital because of a spasm in your
left hand.  In the hospital this evolved into weakness and
numbness in the left hand.  We found that you had a stroke that
caused the symptoms.  It was likely caused by a clot from around
the stent that was put in your brain because of the aneurysm you
have.

The best way to treat this is to continue your Plavix.  It is
very important that you take it every day.  You should also
avoid taking Ibuprofen, Motrin, or Advil, as these can interact
with Plavix.

It is very important that you quit smoking, as this increases
your risk for blood clots and could cause another stroke.

Please call your doctor or go to the ER if you develop any new
neurologic symptoms, such as headache, weakness, numbness,
slurred speech, confusion, dizziness, or trouble walking, as
these could be signs of another stroke.

Followup Instructions:
Neurosurgery: Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **], [**2129-1-6**] at 10:00 AM.  [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **],
[**Hospital Unit Name 12193**].  Please call [**Telephone/Fax (1) 3666**] if you have any questions
regarding this appointment.
