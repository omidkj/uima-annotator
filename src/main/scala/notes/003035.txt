Brief Hospital Course:
She was admitted for presumed apiration pneumonia and started on
antibiotics.  Pt had one witness aspiration event.  Her oral
meds were held.  She then went into A-FIB with rapid ventricular
responce.  She was transferred to the CCU and started on an
amiodarone drip.  She went back into sinus rhythm and was
transfered back to the floor.  There was a concern on the floor
for her pressure ulcer that it might have progressed to
osteomylitis.  A Bone scan was performed which ruled out
osteomylitis of the sacrum.  Local wound care was provided.
However there was still a concern for infection of the pressure
ulcer and given the fact that she had an episode of hypotension
and fever (100.4) she was started on IV vancomycin and IV
cefepime. She remained stable on these antiobiotics.  A PICC
line was inserted on [**9-26**] for IV antibiotics.  Pt. had another
episode of aspiration on [**2200-9-26**].  At the time if aspiration her
sats dropped to the 80s.  Food was immediately suctioned out and
deep suctioning was performed.  Her diet was changed from soft
to puree.  Flagyl was added to her antibiotics and it was
decided to keep her on a ten day course of antibiotics for her
aspiration event. Her Vancomycin, cefepime and flagyl course
will be completed on [**2200-10-6**]. Her code status was DNR/DNI. On
[**2200-9-27**] she was discharged to [**Hospital 100**] Rehab.

Problems:
.
# Pneumonia: Pt arrived with cough, fevers, and O2 saturations
in the 90's on 70% shovel mask.  The patient was tachypneic and
fatigued, but able to moderately communicate.  The CXR showed L
mid/lower opacity concernig for pneumona.  She was started on
broad spectrum antibiotcis: Vancomycin, Cefepime and
Ciprofloxacin.  The patient had an elevated WBC on admission
(16.2) that decreased to 9.6 after antibiotics.  The patient
continued to have intermittent productive cough and rhonchi, but
improved from admission. There was a concern for anaerobes from
aspiration and the patient antibiotcs were changed to
vancomycin, cefepime and flagyl.  Her The patient was also
symptomatically managed with nebs Q6 and respiratory care. The
blood cultures were pending and the Legionella antigen was
negative.  She should be monitored and started on treatment if
symptoms continue.  She comlpeted a course of Levoquin and
Flagyl in the hospital. However she aspirated again on [**2200-9-26**],
flagyl was added to her antibiotics and it was decided to
continue a ten day course of flagyl, vancomycin and cefepime.
.
# Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation: The patient was found to be in
sinus rhythm at admission. Her INR was subtherapeutic on
admission (1.4) and her coumadin dose was increased from 1mg
daily to 2mg.  Her Digoxin and diltiazem was held on admission
because she was NPO due to lethargy and aspiration risk, but was
restarted the following day.  On [**2200-9-14**] her meds were again held
because of aspiration risk, but she remained in sinus rhythm.
On [**2200-9-15**] at 8:15am she went into A-fib w/ RVR (HR 140-180)and
hypotensive 60-70/doppler.  She was given 5mg diltazem x 2 and
IV fluids.  Her pressures remained low and desated into the low
90's.  Cardiology was consulted and amiodarone 150mg over
10minutes was started.  She remained in a-fib w/ RVR (HR
120-140) and was transferred to the CCU.  The family was
notified of the transfer and patient status.  Pt started on
amiodarone drip, given calcium and converted to sinus around
noon on [**9-15**].  She was converted to PO amiodarone 100mg and
started on PO diltiezem.  She remained in sinus and was
trasnferred out of the CCU on [**2200-9-17**].  She remained on telemetry
