pericardial valve)


History of Present Illness:
65 year old patient with previous cardiac history of coronary
artery disease with multiple stent placements, presented with
increasing shortness of
breath and was found to have severe mitral regurgitation and was
electively admitted for mitral valve replacement. The
preoperative transesophageal echo demonstrated mitral
regurgitation secondary to A2 prolapse and the retracted
posterior leaflets.

[**2144-8-28**] CXR
The right subclavian catheter terminates in the superior vena
cava. The cardiac pacemaker is in good position with the leads
projecting over the right atrium and the right ventricle. There
is a prosthetic valve noted. Patient is status post median
sternotomy with normal alignment of the sternal sutures. The
cardiomediastinal is enlarged, however stable.
The lung volumes are low. There is persistent right bibasilar
atelectasis and left lower lobe atelactasis/consolidation. Small
bilateral effusions persist. No pneumothorax. Patchy opacity in
the left upper lobe consistent with aspiration.

[**2144-9-1**] Upper Ext U/S
No evidence of acute right upper limb DVT.

[**2144-9-2**] Lower EXT U/S
No evidence of right or left lower limb DVT

[**2144-9-1**] Head CT
There is no acute intracranial hemorrhage. No mass effect is
seen. No shift of normally limited structures is noted. The
surrounding osseous and soft tissue structures are unremarkable.
No evidence of acute infarction visible on CT is noted.


[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 4125**]ospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 12740**] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2144-8-18**] for surgical
management of her mitral valve disease. She was taken directly
to the operating room where she underwent a mitral valve
replacement utilizing a 27mm [**Last Name (un) **] [**Doctor Last Name **] pericardial
tissue valve. Postoperatively she was taken to the cardiac
surgical intensive care unit for monitoring. The
electrophysiology service was consulted to adjust her permenant
pacemaker settings as her epicardial atrial wire was not
capturing. On postoperative day one, her plavix was resumed for
her coronary stents. She was transfused for a low hematocrit.
She remained intubated as she still required inotropes. A
steroid tapor was started. A heparin induced throbocytopenia
assay was sent given her low platelet count however this
returned negative and her thrombocytopenia resolved. Tube feeds
were given while she was intubated to maintain her nutritional
support. The wound care service was consulted and followed her
for blisters on the lumbar region of her back and her foot
ulcer. She deeloped low grade temperatures and a sputum culture
was sugestive of pneumonia. Zosyn was subsequently started. On
postoperative day seven, Mrs. [**Known lastname 12740**] awoke neurologically intact
and was extubated. Diuresis was continued for peripheral edema.
A swallowing evaluation was performed which showed Mrs. [**Known lastname 12740**] to
be swallowing appropriately and her diet was advanced as
tolerated. The physical and occupational therapy services were
consulted for assistance with her postoperative strength and
mobility. The electrophysiology service continued to make
adjustments to her pacemaker as she had an episode of
nonsustained ventricular tachycardia. On postoperative day
thirteen, Mrs. [**Known lastname 12740**] was transferred to the cardiac surgical
step down unit for further recovery. The jolsin diabetes service
was consulted for assistance with her diabetes management. A
neurology consult was obtained for right hand weakness and the
sensation of a transiet ischemic attack. A head CT was ngative
however anticoagulation with heparin as a bridge to coumadin was
recommended for paroxysmal atrial fibrillation in addition to
her aspirn and plavix. A lower and upper extremity ultrasound
was performed which ruled out any venous thombosis. A urinalysis
was sent due to incontinence which was negative. Mrs. [**Known lastname 12740**]
continued to make steady progress and was discharged to
rehabilitation on postoperative day sixteen. She will follow-up
with Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) **], her cardiologist, her primary care
physician, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] electrophysiology service and the neurology
service as an outpatient.
