History of Present Illness:
79M with CAD s/p recent CABG & AVR, CHF (EF 20%), DM2,
hyperlipidemia, and HTN who has been at [**Hospital **] Rehab for the
past 2 weeks following a prolonged hospitalization at [**Hospital1 112**] for
CHF, CABG, AVR c/b difficulty weaning and trach placement (since
removed), G-tube placement, line infection, ileus, oral
candidiasis, and sacral decub ulcer. On day of admission, pt was
in an ambulance on his way to a scheduled cardiology appt when
his SBP was noted to be in the 60s and he was instead brought to
the ED for further evaluation.
<br>
Of note, pt had increased sputum at [**Hospital1 **] and was started on
[**First Name9 (NamePattern2) 64983**] [**1-26**] for presumed bronchitis vs PNA. This AM,
covering rehab MD [**First Name (Titles) 8706**] [**Last Name (Titles) 7968**] UOP, elevated HR, and "low but
unchanged SBP in 100-120 range." In addition, pt's lisinopril 5
mg daily was held due to creatinine 2.2 (up from 1.3 per
report).
<br>
Upon arrival to [**Name (NI) **], pt's BP 67/44, HR 110s, temp 101.2, Sat 97%
2L NC. SBP improved to 90s within ~ 2 hours after IVF given. In
addition, patient was found to have RUQ tenderness so CT
abd/pelvis was obtained & showed "sludge within a distended
appearing gallbladder. There may also be pericholecystic fluid
or wall edema that is concerning for acute cholecystits." CT
also revealed pericardial and bilat pleural effusions, moderate
ascites, and R-inguinal hernia with nonobstucted small bowel.
Surgery was consulted & recommended IV antibiotics and urgent
percutaneous GB drainage catheter placement by IR. Labs were
signif for WBC 15 w/88% neut, 0% bands, Hct 24, K+ 5.7, proBNP
30,000. Lactate 1.5, INR 2.2 on coumadin. Pt rec'd [**Name (NI) 64983**],
flagyl, vancomycin, 2U PRBC, 1L NS, and Tylenol PR. Two sets
blood Cx sent.
<br>
Upon my eval in the ED, he denies any abdom pain, F/C, N/V, or
diarrhea (in fact is slightly constipated). He has noted
increased sputum production (yellow, thick) over the past few
days. Pt also c/o pain in his buttocks at the site of skin
breakdown. Denies CP, SOB, palpitations. Pt also denies any
lightheadedness, visual changes, or known confusion when his BP
was low. Also denies BRBPR, melena, hematuria, or new bruises.
No known aspiration or choking episodes.

CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: There is a small
pericardial effusion. There are coronary artery calcifications.
A metallic clip is seen in the region of the pericardium. There
are moderate large bilateral pleural effusions, right greater
than left. There is bibasilar atelectasis/consolidation, as well
as consolidation/collapse within the right middle lobe. There is
a 4-mm calcified nodule in the left lower lobe. There is also
fluid in the left major fissure. On the unenhanced scan, the
liver, adrenal glands, kidneys, and pancreas are unremarkable.
Multiple calcifications are seen within the spleen. There are
multiple vascular calcifications within the abdomen. There is
atherosclerotic calcification of the descending aorta, including
at the major branch points of the celiac axis, and inferior
mesenteric arteries, as well as bilateral renal arteries. There
is high attenuation layering within the gallbladder consistent
with sludge. There is a small-to-moderate amount of ascites seen
adjacent to the liver, spleen, and pancreas. There also appears
to be fluid in the gallbladder fossa, some of which may
represent wall edema or pericholecystic fluid. The gallbladder
itself is distended. Lymph nodes are seen within the mesentery
measuring approximately 7-8 mm. There are similar appearing left
paraaortic lymph nodes. There is a G-tube in place. There is
also stranding of the mesentery. There are no dilated loops of
large or small bowel.
<BR>
CT OF THE PELVIS WITHOUT IV CONTRAST:
1 Pericardial effusion, and moderate bilateral pleural
effusions. Bibasilar atelectasis/consolidation. 2 Moderate
ascites. 3 Sludge within a distended appearing gallbladder.
There may also be pericholecystic fluid or wall edema. This is
concerning for acute cholecystits in the appropriate clinical
setting. 4. Right inguinal hernia containing nonobstructed small
bowel and fluid.
<BR>
PORTABLE CHEST RADIOGRAPH: The patient is status post median
sternotomy with sternal wires seen. The patient is status post
mitral valve replacement. There are bibasilar opacities which
could be secondary to pulmonary edema and/or overlying
consolidation. There are bilateral pleural effusions, left
greater than right. IMPRESSION: Developing pulmonary edema with
possible underlying consolidations.
<BR>
[**2-12**] NON-CONTRAST CT SCAN OF THE NECK: An endotracheal tube is
in place. Contrast is visualized around the upper aspect of the
endotracheal tube and in the cervical esophagus. No definite
sizeable masses are identified in the neck. No definite free
fluid collections within the neck are identified. There is a
right subclavian catheter.

IMPRESSION: Contrast material visualized
