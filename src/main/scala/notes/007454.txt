Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7223**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Left Heart Catheterization with Successful PTCA of the LCX/OM2


History of Present Illness:
The patient is a [**Age over 90 **] y/o male w/ hx of CAD s/ BMS x 3 ('[**22**]), sev
AS, s/d CHF, HTN presents with complaints of chest pain.
Patient admitted in [**11-19**] w/ complaints appearing to be unstable
angina.  Had dynamic EKG changes with ST depressions in the
precordial leads.  Underwent cardiac catheterization, w/ BMS to
OM2, D1, LCx.  Had peak troponin of 0.33 at that time.  Patient
has had two admissions since of similiar complaints of chest
pain, and reportedly dynamic EKG changes, and was treated with
medical manegment after ruling out by cardiac enzymes.  The
patient describes daily chest pain, but does not describe
associated activity as an inciting factor.  He says that he
tries to avoid taking nitro.
  On the day prior to presentation he was walking when he began
to feel [**10-22**] substernal chest tightness without radiation for
5-10 minutes.  It was relieved by taking nitro.  Again this
morning, patient had a second episode of chest pain.  He was in
the shower with onset of [**10-22**] squeezing chest pressure without
radiation.  Chest pain again was relieved by SLNG.  These past
episodes are similar to daily chest discomfort, but more severe.

.
On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
He denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other
review of systems were negative.
*** Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of dyspnea
on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle
edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.
.
.
In the ED, initial vitals were T: 100.1 HR: 80 BP: 150/64 RR: 18
O2Sat: 99% on 2L. Patient had a further episode of chest pain,
was given SLNG x 1, with resolution of chest pain.  Patient
noted to have ST segment depressions in anterolateral and
anterior leads.  He was started on a heparin and nitro drip, and
and was admitted for further evaluation and management.
.
.
 On arrival to the floor, patient's  T 98.6, BP 137/61 P 80 O2
100 % on 2L.  He was friendly and cooperative throughout
interview and denied any chest discomfort.  Nitro and heparin
were discontinued, explained below in assesment and plan.
Patient then began to experience [**2125-4-16**] chest discomfort.
Became tachycardic and uncomfortable with a decreas of sats from
99 to 93% on 2L with new crackles on exam b/l [**1-13**] way up lung
fields.  Patient was given 1mg IV morphine, 1 SLNG, 20mg IV
lasix with complete resolution of symptoms.

CXR [**2123-5-21**]:
FINDINGS: Bedside AP examination labeled "up at 12:00 p.m.", is
compared with study dated [**2123-3-16**]. Though the lung volumes appear
larger, there is diffuse interstitial prominence with [**Last Name (un) 16765**]
B-lines and pulmonary vascular congestion, as well as stable
cardiomegaly. There is no overt edema or pleural effusion. No
focal consolidation is seen. There are atherosclerotic changes
involving the thoracic aorta.

IMPRESSION: Interstitial edema, new since [**2123-3-16**].

TTE [**3-20**]:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The estimated right atrial
pressure is 0-5 mmHg. There is severe symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is mild to moderate
regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with inferior
akinesis and inferior septal/inferior lateral hypokiensis.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular
filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size
and free wall motion are normal. The aortic root is mildly
dilated at the sinus level. The ascending aorta is moderately
dilated. The aortic arch is mildly dilated. There are three
aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately
thickened. There is moderate to severe aortic valve stenosis
(area 0.9cm2). Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic
pressure is normal. There is an anterior space which most likely
represents a fat pad.

IMPRESSION: Mild to moderate regional LV dysfunction. Moderate
to severe aortic stenosis and mild aortic regurgitation. Mild to
moderate mitral regurgitation. Dilated thoracic aorta.

Cardiac Cath:
COMMENTS:
1. Selective coronary angiography of this right-dominant system
demosntrated two vessel coronary artery disease. The LMCA had
40%
proximal and 30% distal stenosis. The LAD was a moderately
calcified
vessel. The 30% proximal LAD lucency seen on prior angiogram was

unchanged. A 70% calcific mid LAD lesion was noted at the D1
origin. The
D1, which was stented in [**2122-11-12**] with a BMS, was
stump-occluded
without antegrade flow. The D1 post the occluded stent filled
via right-
to-left collaterals. The proximal LCX had 50% in-stent
restenosis
extending into the stented OM2 branch. The OM2 had 65% in-stent
restenosis at the proximal segment of the stent and 60% at the
distal
end of the stent. The AV groov LCX was diffusely diseased with
80%
stenosis in a small lower pole of OM2. The RCA is a large
caliber
dominant vessel with diffuse mild plaquing and focal heavy
calcification.
