Brief Hospital Course:
49 yo male with poorly controlled DM here with DKA. Anion gap
remains at 35. Also with transaminaitis and elevated wbc.
*
1. DKA: Unclear precipitant. Insulin non-compliance vs. GI
source.
Followed anion gap until closed on hd#2.  Aggressive IVF wtih NS
and bicarb was used to volume resuscitate and for acidosis.
Insulin gtt at 10units/hr was started (was off x 1 hour while in
ambulance) and titrated for gap to close. Then [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) **]
consult recommendations, was started on lantus regimen and
humalog sliding scale.
*
2. Volume Depletion:  Aggresively repleted with IVF.
*
3. GI: Abdominal Pain, Nausea, Vomiting, and transaminiaitis.
Stool studies were negative, lft's trended down, hep panel was
negative, Hep C IgM still pending as send out lab. Synthetic
function was normal. Abdominal u/s showed: "Cholelithiasis with
a moderate amount of gallbladder wall edema. The presence of
perihepatic ascites and hypoalbuminemia makes third spacing of
fluid as the cause for this gallbladder wall edema likely. Acute
cholecystitis remains another diagnostic possibility, although a
son[**Name (NI) 493**] [**Name (NI) **] sign was not present during the exam (If
indicated, a nuclear medicine HIDA scan could be obtained to
exclude this diagnosis). Other infectious etiologies such as
acute hepatitis should also be considered." Will f/u with [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]
