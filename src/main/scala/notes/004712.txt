Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was taken to the operating room on [**2159-5-2**] and again
on [**2159-5-9**].  His hospital course will be outlined in a system
format below:

Neuro: Post-operatively, the patient's pain was managed via a
PCA.  He did well.  He reported that his pain was well
controlled. On POD [**4-22**], the patient started c/o increasing
abdominal pain. He became febrile and tachycardic. In addition
he became acutely delirous resulting in a code purple.
Psychiatry was consulted for acute agitation.  It was discovered
that the patient had a enteric leak causing the agitation.
After being re-operated on, the patient did not have further
episodes of agitation or confusion.  His pain was once again
managed on a PCA and eventually transitioned to PO pain
medications.  No further psychiatry input was required.

CV: Post-operatively, the patient did well.  He was
hemodynamically stable.  He did not require any pressors.
However on POD [**4-22**], the patient became tachycardic [**12-18**] enteric
leak.  After the second operation, the patient did not have
futher episodes of tachycardia.  He is hemodynamically stable at
the time of discharge.

Resp: The patient was successfully extubated in the OR.  He was
placed on nasal cannula post-operatively.  On POD 4, the patient
had acute respiratory distress requiring admission to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].
W/U was negative for LE DVT but POSITIVE for left upper lobe
subsegmental PEs and a large left pleural effusion.  The
effusion was seen pre-operatively, likely [**12-18**] to his
pancreatitis, thus the decision was made not to perform a
thoracocentesis. He was anticoagulated appropriately and started
on aggressive chest PT/incentive spirometry.  His oxygen
requirements decreased slowly and eventually he was weaned off
supplemental O2.  Serial CXRs were done to evaluate the left
pleural effusion.  Because the patient went down to IR for an
abdominal drainage procedure, they also performed a
thoracocentesis, effectively draining 500 cc of straw colored
fluid.  Post-procedure CXR shows a small loculated PTX and the
CT was placed on wall suction.  He has no respiratory issues.
Eventually his CT had little drainage, was placed on water seal
and eventually discontinued.  He continues to maintain his
saturation in the mid-90's on RA.

GI: After arriving to the ED, a CT scan of the abdomen and
pelvis with p.o. and
IV contrast showed a large hypodense mass within the spleen with
blood tracking posterior to the spleen and into the pelvis.
Findings were consistent with a subcapsular hematoma of the
spleen which had ruptured.  He was taken to IR for urgent
embolization and then taken to the OR for a hematoma evacuation
and distal pancreatectomy and total splenectomy.  His
post-operatively course was c/b a leak for which he was taken
back to the OR on POD 7.  A large leak seen on the Roux Limb was
identified.  It was repaired, a J-tube was placed, and his
abdomen was irrigated and closed.  Post-operatively the patient
required IR drainage of a fluid collection adjacent/at the site
of surgery.  He continued to be NPO and his tube feeds were
advanced through his J-tube.  He tolerated this well to goal.
On POD 19/12, the patient started on a regular diet to see if
there was a pancreatic leak of some sort. There did not appear
to be an increase in drain output.

Renal: The patient UOP was adequate throughout his
hospitalization course.  His creatinine was stable.  His foley
was eventually discontinued and he voided without difficulties.

ID: The patient was cultured numerous times throughout his
hospitalization course given his fevers.  In addition OR
cultures were also obtained.  While awaiting cultures, the
patient was placed on broad spectrum antibiotics.  The only
positive blood culture was on [**2159-5-8**] 1/2 bottles for
STAPHYLOCOCCUS, COAGULASE NEGATIVE. Further blood
cultures/surveillence cultures were negative. Cultures intraop
as well as from the abdominal drains grew out HAEMOPHILUS
SPECIES NOT INFLUENZAE (HEAVY GROWTH, repeat culture shows
sparse growth), [**Female First Name (un) **] ALBICANS (SPARSE GROWTH), and
LACTOBACILLUS SPECIES (RARE GROWTH). Multiple C-difficle were
negative. Urine culture showed no growth multiple times.  After
a long duration of antibiotics, all his antibiotics were
discontinued on [**2159-5-18**].  He was afebrile > 48 hours and his
post-splenectomy vaccines were administered on [**2159-5-20**].

Heme: The patient was anticoagulated for his PE. During a
bedside ultrasound for CVL placement, a clot was noted in his L
IJ, which may have been the source of his PE.  He was
therapeutic on a heparin gtt of 2050 Units.  He was given
Coumadin and his INR became therapeutic [**Female First Name (un) **] dose of 7.5 mg.  His
hep gtt was stopped thereafter.
From [**Date range (1) 81787**], he continued to recover. His diet was
advanced to regular, and he tolerated this well without increase
in output from either of his JP drains or from his pigtail
catheter, situated in the splenic bed. Because the drain outputs
did not appear to increase after food, we surmised that the
pancreatic fistula had healed to an extent, and we removed one
of the JP drains. Because he tolerated a regulat diet, we
stopped his supplemental tube feeds.

He continued on warfarin for his PE/DVT. He is discharged on a
regular diet, on oral pain medication, able to care for himself.
He has received drain care and has been deemed competent to take
care of his drains, as has his mother. [**Name (NI) **] will be sent home with
the pigtail, JP drain and J-tube in place. He is to follow up in
office with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1924**] in [**11-17**] weeks.
