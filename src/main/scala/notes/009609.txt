transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management of hypotension;
concern for possible sepsis or adrenal crisis. Pt reports some
epigastric pain prior to vomitting, also some lingering cough
from a pneumonia she was recovering from during prior

SBP dropped to 65 when sitting up. She has received 1L IVF here
(probably 5L total incl EMS and OSH). Exam with L basilar
crackles, patient mentating well, good UOP. Bedside U/S showed
30% IVC collapse with respiration, no pericardial effusion, no
abdominal fluid. Has RIJ and got vanc, pip-tazo. VS at time of
singout were: 80s 85/50 18-22 96,3L; was concern she'd need
pressors but BP improved. CXR per prelim showed atelectasis.

pt reported taking 2 percocets Q 6-7 hrs, was eating and
drinking, "but not a lot". She was advised [**Doctor First Name **] increae POs and
decreasing percocet use w/further eval recommended. However at
that time she was unable to drive, plan was to visit UC
tomorrow.  On [**4-17**] at [**University/College **] urgent care pt was seen for
dizziness in addition to episodes of discomfort in her chest,

[**2173-4-24**] CXR:

Right IJ line ends at the cavoatrial junction. Thre is no
pneumothorax.
There are mild reticular bibasilar opacities and mild vascular
congestion.
Right basilar opacity has mildly improved. Mild hyperinflation
of the lungs.
Calcified granulomas at the right lung apex are stable.

IMPRESSION: Mild vascular congestion. Improving right bascilar
opacity.
.
[**2173-4-26**] CXR:
FINDINGS: A right pleural effusion is best seen on the lateral
projection and
is mild to moderate in size. A poorly defined opacity in the
right lower lobe
has progressed since [**2173-4-24**] and most likely represents an
evolving pneumonia,
linear densities in the medial right lower lobe likely represent
atelectasis.
Fluid seen in both major fissures is new since [**2173-3-23**].

IMPRESSION:
1. Bilateral pleural effusions, larger on the right, but small
in volume.
2. Evolving hazy opacity in the right lower lobe likely reflects
pneumonia.
.
[**2173-4-26**] RUQ u/s:

FINDINGS: Liver appears normal in echotexture without focal
abnormality or
intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation. Moderate-sized layering
right pleural
effusion. Trace perihepatic ascites. No fluid is seen in both
lower
quadrants or within the pelvis. The gallbladder is surgically
absent. The
proximal common duct is mildly dilated measuring 7 mm and is
nonspecific in
the setting of cholecystectomy. The visualized pancreatic neck
and proximal
body are unremarkable. The remainder of the pancreas is obscured
by overlying
bowel gas. Main portal vein is patent with antegrade flow.
Intrahepatic
portion of the IVC has normal ultrasound appearance. The
proximal aorta is
normal in caliber and the distal aorta is obscured.

The right kidney measures 9.6 cm and the left kidney measures
10.9 cm.
Preserved corticomedullary differentiation and cortical
thickening
bilaterally. Adrenal glands are not well visualized on
ultrasound.

IMPRESSION:
1. Moderate layering right pleural effusion.
2. Trace perihepatic ascites without significant fluid in the
four quadrants
or pelvis.
3. Status post cholecystectomy. Proximal common duct measures 7
mm,
minimally dilated and nonspecific.
4. Adrenal glands not well visualized on ultrasou
