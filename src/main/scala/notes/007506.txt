Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Penicillins / Clindamycin / Celery / apple / bees

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1115**]
Chief Complaint:
nausea/vomiting, abdominal pain, shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Mechanical Ventilation


History of Present Illness:
61F hx of obesity-hypoventilation syndrome, asthma, obstructive
sleep apnea complicated by pulmonary hypertension, cor pulmonale
and s/p trach on home O2 who presents with with nausea x [**1-31**]
days. Per family patient has not been feeling over the last few
days. She c/o abdominal pain and poor po intake. No fevers or
chills, vomiting or diarrhea.  Family also noted that she was
c/o increased secretions on morning of presentation and
requesting to be suctioned. Also noted to be coughing more than
normal, have increased lower extremity swelling, and the need to
sit up while sleeping. The [**Month/Day (3) 269**] evaluated the patient and felt
she should be brought to the ED.
.
She was initially admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] in [**12-9**] for hypercarbic
respiratory failure requiring intubation and tracheostomy. She
was discharged to [**Hospital1 **] and she was weaned of the vent. She was
managed at rehab with red capping during the day and passe muir
valve at night with humidified air. She was then readmitted to
[**Hospital1 18**] recently in [**3-/2127**] after routine visit to PCP where she
was found to be volume overloaded. She was initially admitted to
the MICU due to transient hypotension and then was transferred
back to the MICU after triggering for hypoxia on the floor.
During this admission she was also restarted on sildenafil for
her pulmonary hypertension. She was diuresed with IV lasix and
discharged on lasix 40 mg po daily. She was also treated for E.
Coli UTI with ceftriaxone x 7 days.
.
In the ED, initial VS were: 97.7 96 110/74 28 92% 4L Nasal
Cannula. On exam patient appeared tachypneic to the 20s with
wheezes bilaterally and 3+ bilateral lower extremity edema. She
was also noted to be tender to palpation in the LLQ without
rebound or guarding. Labs were significant for H/H of 10/36
(baseline), Cr of 1.9 (up from 1.3 on recent discharge), INR of
3 (anticoagulated), BNP of [**Numeric Identifier 961**] (up from 4000), and troponin of
0.02. She had a ECG which showed SR with RAD and TWI in III,
V1-V3 consistent with prior. CXR showed evidence of volume
overload. CT abdomen/pelvis showed no acute process. She was
given zofran for nausea, 40 mg IV lasix, solumedrol 125 IV,
azithromycin, and nebs for concern of COPD/CHF exacerbation.
After nebulizer treatments, she was persistently hypoxic to the
70s-80s on FiO2 of 100%. Patient was then started on BiPAP 12/5
FiO2 60% with improved sats to 93%. Patient then became
somnolent and desatted to 70s-80s. She was evaluated by
respiratory and placed on CMV with TV 350 PEEP 10 FiO2 60% and
sat 100%. Blood pressures also dropped to 70s-80s and considered
starting peripheral levo but did not. Patient refused central
access and ABG.
.
On arrival to the CCU, VS were 98.3 72 91/51 20 98% on vent.
Patient somnolent and arousable only to noxious stimuli.

Brief Hospital Course:
61 yo female with hx morbid obesity, obesity-hypoventilation
syndrome, obstructive sleep apnea complicated by pulmonary
hypertension and cor pulmonale s/p trach who presents with
abdominal pain, n/v and LE edema, found to be hypoxic with
improved respiratory status s/p mechanical ventilation and
diuresis.

Active Issues:

# Acute REspiratory failure:
Due to acute diastolic CHF exacerbation (based on LE edema,
elevated BNP and improvment with diuresis) in the setting of
poor pulmonary reserve with severe pulm hypertension, OSA, and
restrictive lung disease/obesity hypoventilation synd
