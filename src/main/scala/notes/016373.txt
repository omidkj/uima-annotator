.
His wife states she looked at him tonight while he was sleeping
and noted he had a gasping, labored breathing. She tried to wake
him up but he was unresponsive. There were no signs of t-c
seizures or fecal incontinece. She called EMS who arrived 20
minutes later.  Patient was alert but somnolent and diaphoretic
at that time. Patient is unsure whether pacemaker went off.

Radiology
CT Abdomen:
FINDINGS:  The evaluation of the great vessels and mediastinum
is somewhat
limited due to lack of intravenous contrast [**Doctor Last Name 360**].  No
significant mediastinal lymphadenopathy is noted.  Coronary
arteries are calcified.  The heart is enlarged in size.  The
patient is status post CABG with median sternotomy. Note is made
of bilateral pleural effusion, somewhat larger on the left,
partially loculated.  There is interlobar effusion on the left
as well.  In the lung window, note is made of diffuse
ground-glass opacity with interlobular septal thickening
predominantly in central distribution involving upper lobes, as
well as lower lobes and middle lobes.  There is somewhat focal
patchy opacity in right middle lobe and lower lobes.  Mucous
secretion in the trachea is seen, however, no central
obstructing lesion is noted.  NG tube is noted, with the tip
terminating in the stomach.  There is no suspicious lytic or
blastic lesion.  Small bone islands are seen in lower thoracic
vertebra.
IMPRESSION:
1.  Moderate amount of pleural effusion, larger on the left and
somewhat
loculated on the left, associated with basilar atelectasis.
Interlobar
effusion on the left.
2.  Diffuse ground-glass opacity predominantly in central
distribution,
associated with smooth interlobular septal thickening
bilaterally involving upper and lower lobes.  The finding may
represent pulmonary edema as mentioned in the report of prior
chest radiograph, however, in the appropriate clinical setting,
superimposed infection cannot be excluded.  Other possibility
includes alveolar hemorrhage if the patient has hemoptysis.
Please correlate clinically.
3.  Patchy opacities in the right middle and lower lobes, which
may be part of diffuse process mentioned in #2, however, please
perform followup study after effusion and ground-glass opacities
have resolved.
4.  Cardiomegaly, status post CABG and coronary artery
calcification.
.
Echocardiogram:
Conclusions:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated.  Left ventricular wall thicknesses are
normal. The left ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. There
is severe global left ventricular hypokinesis (ejection fraction
20-30 percent). No masses or thrombi are seen in the left
ventricle. There is no ventricular septal defect. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no
mitral valve
prolapse. Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed)
of [**2101-2-16**], no major change is evident.


Brief Hospital Course:
The patient expired on [**2101-8-5**] after a prolonged
hospitalization.  I will briefly outline his medical problems
leading up to his death.
.
# Syncope: Patient came in to the hospital secondary to being
found unresponsive by his wife.  A head CT on admission ruled
out an intracranial bleed and his potassium was closely
monitored.  In the emergency department they noted 15-20 beats
of VTach and also a potassium of 2.7.  It was thought that his
VTach was the cause of his syncopal episode and his hypokalemia
was the cause of his VTach.  His potassium was repleted and he
no longer experienced problems with pacing.
.
# CHF: EF 20% -  patient came in appearing euvolemic or even
slightly dry.  He was kept off his spironolactone, his lasix was
initially held and his [**Last Name (un) **] and BB were continued.  His fluid
status was monitored daily with serial exams and he had multiple
chest xrays to monitor for fluid overload.  He subsequently
became fluid overload which prompted a visit to the medical ICU.
 While in the ICU, they tapped a pleural effusion on his left
side which yielded 1.5L of transudative fluid.  They also gave
him gentle diuresis with lasix 10 mg IV.  The patient
subsequently became euvolemic and was transferred back to the
floor.  A day later, he became hypovolemic with a free water
deficit of 3L.  We replaced his fluid deficit appropriately but
struggled with deteriorating respiratory status.
.
# CRI: patient has had a baseline creatinine of 2.0 and had been
increasing over the last month.  His creatinine on admission was
2.5 and it climbed to 3.5 by the end of his stay.  We initially
held his [**Last Name (un) **] and ACE inhibitor and involved renal in his care.
It was thought that his renal impairment was secondary to both
ATN from ischemic injury during his VTach but also from prerenal
azotemia.  We balanced his fluid sta
