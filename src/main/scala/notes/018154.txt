Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1493**]
Chief Complaint:
Reason for Transfer - UGIB; subspecialty care


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
EGD on [**2137-2-8**]: Severe portal hypertensive gastropathy


History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 47 yo morbidly obese M with ETOH cirrhosis,
portal hypertension, and GAVE who originally presented to the
OSH on [**2137-1-21**] after being found unresponsive by his wife at
home. Per OSH records, he was intially thought to have a
brainstem stroke. CT Head was negative for overt stroke. At that
time given his poor overall health the patient was made CMO.
Remarkably, 3 days later, the patient became more responsive and
was transferred to an acute rehab facility on [**2137-1-30**]. Code
status at that time was changed to FULL. On [**2138-2-3**] (at rehab)
the patient became increasingly somnolent and was started on
ciprofloxacin for presumed UTI. Over the next 24 hours his
somnolence increased and his hct was noted to have dropped from
32.7 --> 27.5. He began having melena and his hct continued to
drop. He was then transferred to the OSH ICU. He was started on
IV PPI and Octreotide and his hct stabilized at approximately
Hct 25-26. An EGD was performed and showed severe portal
gastropathy with active oozing. 24 hours later a repeat EGD
showed improvement in the bleeding but continued severe portal
hypertensive gastropathy. He was transfused 2 units of PRBC and
2 units of FFP while in the ICU. His encephalopathy improved
with lactulose. Of note, urine cultures eventually returned
negative and his antibiotics were stopped. The plan was to
transfer to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management of his severe portal
gastropathy and for further assessment.
.
Upon arrival here, the patient reports that he is feeling well.
He denies any recent melena. Had brown stool today. Denies chest
pain, shortness of breath, abdominal pain. + Chronic back pain.
AAO x 3. Patient reports that since he was last seen at [**Hospital1 18**]
1.5 years ago, he has gone from 500lbs to 330lbs.

Sequelae of cirrhosis are evident with fatty infiltration of the
liver, splenomegaly and small amount of ascites. No discrete
focal lesions are seen; however, evaluation is markedly limited
in the presence of fatty infiltration/coarsened echotexture.
Gallbladder is free of stones and sludge. There is no intra- or
extra-hepatic biliary dilatation seen.

The main portal vein is patent and hepatopetal. Intrahepa
