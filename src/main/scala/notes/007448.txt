CT PERFUSION: There is a matched perfusion abnormality with
reduced flow and increased mean transit time involving the left
inferior division MCA territory consistent with established
infarction.
IMPRESSION:
Area of increased mean transit time with reduced flow in the
left inferior
division of MCA with a vessel cutoff suggesting a reversible
infarct. No
evidence of intracranial hemorrhage.

MR HEAD W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2192-7-31**] 10:59 AM
1. Moderately large evolving acute infarct in the left posterior
MCA
territory, and additional small evolving acute infarcts in the
left ACA
territory and medial left temporal lobe. Embolic etiology should
be
considered.

ECHO
The left atrium is elongated. The right atrium is moderately
dilated. No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen
by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers. There is
mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular cavity size is top normal/borderline dilated.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed
(LVEF= 15-20%) with septal akinesis/dyskinesis, apical akinesis
and mid inferior/inferolateral akinesis and hypokinesis
elsewhere. The basal to mid anterolateral segments contract
best. [Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely
more depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.] No
left ventricular thrombus was identified. The right ventricular
cavity is mildly dilated with normal free wall contractility.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is no
aortic valve stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. A mitral valve
annuloplasty ring is present. Moderate to severe (3+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is
seen. There is at least moderate pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion. There is
atherosclerotic plaque in the aortic arch (in limited



Brief Hospital Course:
NEURO: R MCA STROKE
62 yo F with hx HTN and HLD was at work when she developed
global aphasia and right
hemiplegia. Her NIHSS was 22 and exam was notable for global
aphasia, fixed left gaze deviation, and right hemiplegia.  There
were no early infarct signs on CT
head, CTA showed L M2 cutoff, and CT perfusion imaging showed
smaller infarct than what would expect given deficits.  After
discussion with stroke fellow and attending, IV TPA was
administered at 0.9 mg/kg with 10% bolus over one minute at
17:43 followed by remainder as drip for one hour.

At 19:05, she was awake, alert but unable to vocalize. She
followed some simple one step command but inconsistently.
Conjugate eye deviation to left but can look over to the right
on volition. Decreased blink to visual threat on right. R-facial
droop. Dense right sided HP with hemisensory loss.

The patient was admitted to the Neuro ICU for post-tPA
monitoring. BP was allowed to autoregulate with goal SBP 120-185
(home antihypertensives were held).
The following morning, the neuro exam was significantly
improved. She was alert and oriented x 3, with intact naming,
repetition and comprehension. She had extreme difficulty
controlling her R arm and leg, and it seemed to be moving on its
own (severe flinging movements, such that the R wrist was
restrained). We wondering if this was an alien limb syndrome,
however her sensation was significantly impaired, in particular
her position sense, so this could also explain her difficulty.
The following day, the flinging and uncontrolled movements had
stopped. She was able to reach and grab objects with the R hand,
though it remained clumsy due to poor sensory input.

MRI showed moderately large evolving acute infarct in the left
posterior MCA
territory, and additional small evolving acute infarcts in the
left ACA
territory and medial left temporal lobe.

The etiology is most likely cardioembolic, given her history of
dilated cardiomyopathy. She was started on coumadin without a
bridge.  Her fasting lipid panel was: CHOL 132, HDL 52, LDL 67,
TG 65.

LANGUAGE:
Pt was seen by the speech team. Summary and recommendations are
as follows:
Ms. [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname **] presents with at least mild auditory
comprehension, moderate verbal expression deficits, and moderate
[**Location (un) 1131**] comprehension deficits on today's brief, informal
aphasia evaluation.  Speech and voice appear WNL and pragmatics,
insight, problem solving, and attention were functional for
structured tasks.  She is meeting acute needs in this setting
with verbal communication, though relies on her listener for
some inference to her specific thoughts.  She will benefit from
further dx/tx of aphasia in a rehab setting upon d/c.  Specific
goals should
include improved auditory comprehension of complex information,
reduced frequency of paraphasias and word finding, and
functional [**Location (un) 1131**] tasks to promote indepedence in the
community.  Prognosis for improvement in communication is good
given her age, previous level of functioning, family supports,
and motivation.  Her current personal goal is to determine
whether or not she'll be able to return to work at the Gap, as
she's concerned her physical and communication deficits will
make this too
challenging.

CARDS:
Her cardiac history was discussed with her outpatient
cardiologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 89031**] at [**Hospital 1263**] Hospital. She had MVR in
[**2191-10-5**] and has dilated CM (non-ischemic) with EF 25%. Repeat
TTE during this hospitalizaton showed EF 15-20%. She had no
evidence of failure. Blood pressures were low on minimal
medications (100-125) and so she was kept on only 25mg T
