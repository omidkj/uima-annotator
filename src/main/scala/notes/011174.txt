BRIEF HISTORY:
71 year female presents emergently from the medicine floor with
hypoxia,
hypotension, chest and back pain, and 2mm of ST elevation in
lead III.
Past medical history significant for abdominal aortic aneurysm.

INDICATIONS FOR CATHETERIZATION:
CAD

PROCEDURE:
Right Heart Catheterization: was performed by percutaneous entry
of the
right femoral vein, using a 7 French pulmonary wedge pressure
catheter,
advanced to the PCW position through an 8 French introducing
sheath.
Cardiac output was measured by the Fick method.
Left Heart Catheterization: was performed by percutaneous entry
of the
right femoral artery, using a 5 French angled pigtail catheter,
advanced
to the ascending aorta through a 6 French introducing sheath.
Coronary Angiography: was performed in multiple projections
using a 6
French JL4 and a 6 French  JR4 GUIDE catheter, with manual
contrast
injections.
Supravalvular Aortography: was performed in the 30 degrees [**Doctor Last Name **]
projection, using 40 ml of contrast injected at 20 ml/sec,
through the
angled pigtail catheter.
Conscious Sedation:  was provided with appropriate monitoring
performed by
a member of the nursing staff.
