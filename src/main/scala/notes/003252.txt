Admission Date:  [**2198-1-13**]       Discharge Date:  [**2198-1-29**]

Service:  CARD. [**Doctor First Name 147**]

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Shortness of breath.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Ms. [**Known lastname 45419**] is a 68-year-old
female with cardiac risk factors including
non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, hypertension,
hypercholesterolemia, and tobacco use, who was in her usual
state of health until [**2198-1-10**], when she noted an
acute onset of substernal chest pain while cooking which was
associated with shortness of breath.  This chest pain and
shortness of breath lasted for approximately five to ten
minutes and resolved with rest.  She did not seek medical
attention at that time.  On [**2198-1-11**], she again had
another episode of chest pain and shortness of breath while
at rest, which was relieved with a baby aspirin.  On [**2198-1-12**], she again noted acute onset of shortness of breath
without chest pain while at rest and, upon informing her
family, she was taken by ambulance to an outside hospital.
It was noted that her shortness of breath was not positional
or related to exertion.  On the day of admission to the
outside hospital she had sharp upper back pain between her
shoulder blades which was relieved with Motrin.  She at that
time denied any other symptoms.  She denied nausea, vomiting,
chest pain, abdominal pain, lower extremity swelling,
palpitations, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, lightheadedness,
dizziness, melena, diarrhea or constipation.  Upon arrival to
the outside hospital, she was found to be hypoxic to 92% on
oxygen saturation on room air and was started on oxygen by
nasal cannula which relieved her shortness of breath.  She
was also given 10 mg of Lasix intravenously as her chest
x-ray at the time showed pulmonary edema.  An EKG done at the
outside hospital showed ST depressions in the lateral leads,
and her initial cardiac enzymes were found to have a CK of
151 with an MB fraction of 10.5 and a troponin of 3.4.  She
was started on a nitroglycerin drip and subcutaneous Lovenox
injections and was transferred to [**Hospital1 190**] for further management and evaluation.  Upon
arrival at the Emergency Department at [**Hospital1 190**] she was given 25 mg of Lopressor for
hypertension, and admitted to the Cardiology service for
treatment of acute coronary syndrome.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus for approximately
two years.
2.  Borderline hypertension.
3.  Borderline hypercholesterolemia.
4.  Melanoma status post resection from the chin times two.

MEDICATIONS AT THE TIME OF ADMISSION:
1.  Metformin 500 mg once per day.
2.  She was also on a nitroglycerin drip from the outside
hospital.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient states that she smoked one-half
pack per day for 20 years but had quit 15 years previously.
She lives with her husband and has three healthy children.

FAMILY HISTORY:  There is no family history of coronary
artery disease or cerebrovascular disease.  There is an
extensive history of cancer.  Father died of prostate cancer
at age 79, mother died of multiple myeloma at age 80.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  The patient was found to
have a temperature of 97.4, heart rate of 86 in sinus rhythm,
blood pressure of 164/90 with an oxygen saturation of 96% on
two liters nasal cannula.  In general, she was an elderly
female in no apparent distress.  Her pupils were equally
reactive to light and accommodation with extraocular muscles
intact and anicteric sclerae.  Her mucus membranes were dry.
Her neck was supple with jugular venous pressure estimated at
8 cm, 2+ palpable carotid pulses, with a question of carotid
bruit versus radiation of cardiac murmur.  Her lung
examination demonstrated rales up to one-third of her lung
fields bilaterally with no wheezes.  There was some left lung
dullness, but no egophony or accessory muscle use.  Her heart
showed a regular rate and rhythm with normal S1, S2, and a
grade [**2-22**] mid to late peaking crescendo-decrescendo systolic
murmur heard best at the left upper sternal border and
radiating to the carotids.  She was found to have no rubs or
gallops.  Her abdomen was obese, soft, non-tender,
non-distended, with no hepatosplenomegaly and no palpable
masses.  There were no periumbilical or femoral bruits.  Her
extremities showed [**1-18**]+ edema bilaterally up to the mid shin
in the lower extremities.  She had 1+ palpable dorsalis pedis
and posterior tibial pulses bilaterally.  On neurological
examination, she was alert and oriented times three, with
cranial nerves II through XII intact and no focal motor or
sensory deficits.

LABORATORIES ON ADMISSION:  Showed a white count of 11.7 with
hematocrit of 31.3 and platelet count of 267,000.  Chem-7
showed a sodium of 135, potassium 4, chloride 102,
bicarbonate of 20, BUN and creatinine of 15 and 0.5 and a
blood glucose of 234.  Her CK at this hospital was 117 with
an MB fraction of 11.

ELECTROCARDIOGRAM:  EKG done at the time showed sinus rhythm
at 68 beats per minute with T-wave inversions in leads V5,
V6, 1 and aVL, as well as in 2, 3 and aVF.  It was found to
have poor R-wave progression.  There were no ST elevations or
depressions noted.  In comparison with the EKG from the
outside hospital, the ST depressions noted in the lateral
leads had resolved.

RADIOLOGY:  On chest x-ray she was found to have bilateral
effusions with interstitial edema and borderline
cardiomegaly.  There were no infiltrates noted.  CT of the
chest, abdomen and pelvis was also done which showed no
dissection, no pericardial effusion, bilateral mild pleural
effusions and bilateral increased septal thickening.  The
abdomen and pelvis were found to be unremarkable.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Ms. [**Known lastname 45419**] was admitted to the hospital
through the Emergency Department to the Cardiology service
and was monitored for a period.  During the next couple days
she continued to have episodes of shortness of breath and
chest pain, and a troponin which was continually monitored
peaked at 21.  Due to her continuing instability, she was
taken to the Cardiac Catheterization Suite on hospital day
three, and was found to have severe left main, left
circumflex, and right coronary artery disease.  She was also
found to have mild left ventricular dysfunction, marked left
ventricular diastolic dysfunction, moderate mitral
regurgitation, and moderate pulmonary hypertension.  Due to
her catheterization results and continued instability and
symptomatology, the patient was taken to the Operating Room
on [**2198-1-16**], where she underwent coronary artery
bypass graft times four.  Please refer to the dictated
operative note for full details of this procedure.  She
tolerated the procedure well and was transferred
postoperatively to the Cardiac Surgical Intensive Care Unit.
At the time of transfer, she was on a propofol drip at 10
mcg/kg/min.  She was also on Neo-Synephrine and nitroglycerin
drip to maintain her systolic blood pressure in an acceptable
range.  She was A-paced at 88 beats per minute and no ectopy
was noted, with an underlying rhythm of 47 beats per minute.
She was weaned from the ventilator and extubated late on the
day of surgery which she tolerated well.  On postoperative
day one she continued to be A-paced at 88 beats per minute as
her underlying rhythm was sinus bradycardia in the 40's.  She
was also continuing to require Neo-Synephrine drip to
maintain her systolic blood pressure in the 130 to 140 range
which was necessary due to her carotid artery disease.  On
postoperative day two, the patient was transfused one unit of
packed red blood cells due to a hematocrit of 24.9 with a
repeat hematocrit of 28.1.  Her Neo-Synephrine drip was also
weaned to off, as her systolic blood pressure remained in the
120 to 140 range without need for the drip.  She did,
however, remained A-paced, as her underlying rhythm ranged
between 40 and 60 beats per minute.  On postoperative day
three, she was noted to have some low urine output for
approximately two to three hours, at which time Lasix was
started.  She also demonstra
