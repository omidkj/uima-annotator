Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Penicillins / morphine

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 603**]
Chief Complaint:
tracheal stenosis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Microsuspension laryngoscopy, CO2 laser excision of tracheal
stenosis, rigid dilation, tracheostomy change [**2201-3-6**]


History of Present Illness:
40 yo F with Crohn's disease, DM2, HTN, CAD with h/o STEMI s/p
CABGx5, tracheal stenosis, s/p trach, initially presenting for
microsuspension laryngoscopy and CO2 laser reexcision of
subglottic stenosis with dilation by ENT, now transferred to
medicine post-operatively for consideration of tracheal
resection by thoracic surgery.
.
The patient had a STEMI in [**6-/2200**], and underwent emergency CABG.
She was intubated for 7 days due to cardiogenic shock. She was
successfully extubated, but subsequently developed tracheitis
and eventually needed a tracheostomy. She was found to have
complete tracheal stenosis. On [**2200-9-11**], re-canalization of
stenotic area was attempted via flexible and rigid
bronchoscopies, but was unsuccessful. Additional attempts to
alleviate the tracheal stenosis were made by ENT on [**2201-2-20**]
and again today, with the goal of placing a T-tube, but without
success.
.
Today, the patient underwent microsuspension laryngoscopy and
CO2 laser reexcision of subglottic stenosis with dilation by
ENT. She received general anesthesia and remained
hemodynamically stable throughout the case. She developed
hyperglycemia in the PACU, for which she was given regular
insulin 8 units. She is now transferred to medicine further
further management while consultants from interventional
pulmonology, thoracic surgery, and ENT consider surgical
options.
.
On the medical floor, the patient had no complaints.

caliber with persistent tracheal wall thickening.
2. Interval improvement in bilateral pulmonary consolidations
with residual ground glass opacity, which may be exaggerated by
expiratory phase imaging.
3. Stable mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy.
4. Possible right thyroid nodule for which non-urgent ultrasound
is recommended.

Brief Hospital Course:
40 yo F with Crohn's disease, DM2, HTN, CAD with h/o STEMI s/p
CABGx5, tracheal stenosis, s/p trach, initially presenting for
microsuspension laryngoscopy and CO2 laser reexcision of
subglottic stenosis with dilation by ENT. The patient was
transferred to medicine post-operatively for management of her
diabetes, HTN, and CHF while the various surgical services
developed a plan. Her course was complicated by respiratory
depression from morphine, requiring a brief ICU stay. She was
discharged with a plan for outpatient thoracic surgery, ENT, and
interventional pulmonary follow-up for consideration of tracheal
resection.
.
# Tracheal stenosis: The patient underwent microsuspension
laryngoscopy and CO2 laser reexcision of subglottic stenosis
with dilation on [**2201-3-6**]. The procedure was not successful in
alleviating the patient's tracheal stenosis. She was transferred
to medicine post-operatively while ENT, interventional
pulmonary, and thoracic surgery evaluated how to address the
tracheal stenosis. CT was performed to determine the length of
the stenosis. The thoracic surgery service recommended
consideration of tracheal resection, and asked cardiology to
consult for pre-operative evaluation. Cardiology was consulted
and noted that the patient has a high risk for peri-operative
cardiac complications, but felt that no further cardiac testing
or interventions were required prior to surgery. The patient
continue benzonatate, mucinex, albuterol, and duonebs. She was
discharged with a plan to follow up with thoracic surgery,
interventional pulmonology, and ENT as an outpatient for further
discussion of tracheal resection. The patient is trach-dependent
and cannot be intubated from above.
.
# Hypotension/somnolence/respiratory depression:
Post-operatively, the patient complained of chest and throat
discomfort. The chest discomfort is a chronic complaint, was
highly reproducible on exam, and was felt to be musculoskeletal
in origin (see below). The patient requested liquid morphine
rather than her home oxycodone due to ease of swallowing, and
the dose was uptitrated as she continued to complain of pain. On
[**2201-3-10**], the patient developed a mucus plug, followed by
respiratory depression, and hypotension. She was transferred to
the MICU, where she was treated with a narcan gtt. The patient's
symptoms were attributed to morphine. The patient's condition
improved, and she was weaned off of the narcan gtt and
transferred back to the medical floor. Future providers should
be aware that Mrs. [**Known lastname **] is very sensitive to the accumulation
of morphine and its metabolites.
.
# Hyperkalemia: The patient present with K 5.3, likely related
to lisinopril + potassium supplementation. Potassium
supplementation was stopped. The patient was discharged off of
lisinopril due to low-normal blood pressure, but this can likely
be restarted (without any potassium supplementation and with
close electrolyte monitoring) in the outpatient setting.
.
# ?Right thyroid nodule: Noted incidentally on CT trachea. This
was discussed with the patient's primary care doctor Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 90669**]
[**Name (STitle) 65534**] on [**2201-3-17**]. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 65534**] will arrange for a non-urgent
thyroid ultrasound to further characterize the possible nodule.
.
# Chest pain: The patient had chest pain that was highly
reproducible with palpation and started with cough, with EKG
unchanged and cardiac enzymes normal. The pain was felt to be of
musculoskeletal etiology.
.
# Diabetes mellitus: The patient presented for her elective ENT
procedure on [**2201-3-6**] with blood sugar >400. She was transferred
to medicine post-operative, and was managed with her home dose
of Lantus 38 units QHS, with a Humalog insulin sliding scale.
She was discharged on her pre-admission insulin regimen of
Lantus 38 units at night, with sliding scale.
.
# CAD s/p CABG: Continued aspirin, Plavix, metoprolol. Held
lisinopril in the setting of hyperkalemia, then restarted
lisinopril as hyperkalemia resolved. Subsequently held
lisinopril due to hypotension. Lisinopril can likely be titrated
back on by the patient's primary care physician at the time of
follow-up
.
# Chronic systolic heart failure: EF 35-40% per TTE [**2200-8-4**]. The
patient was euvolemic at the time of discharge. Lasix was held,
with a plan to restart, likely at a lower dose, at the time of
PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 702**]. Lisinpril was held due
