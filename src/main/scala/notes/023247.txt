History of Present Illness:
51 year old man with acute promyelocytic leukemia status post
allogeneic bone marrow transplant two years ago, complicated by
extensive moderate graft vs. host disease (extending to his
skin, eyes, lungs, and GI tract), resistant stenotrophomonas in
his sputum, and bronchiolitis obliterans (FVC 2.31 and FEV1
0.75), transferred from [**Hospital3 **] emergency department to
[**Hospital1 18**] for respiratory failure and hypotension. He was recently
discharged from [**Hospital1 18**] after a hospitalization for exacerbation
of his pulmonary GVHD. He had a 12[**Hospital 15386**] hospital stay, ending
[**11-19**]. He uses home oxygen and his oxygen saturation had been
95% on 2 liters.
He was noted to have increasing weakness over the past several
days, as well as progressive respiratory distress and change in
mental status. On the day of admission, he had increased work of
breathing and significant confusion. His family noted he was
saying things that were coherent but inappropriate, such as
saying he was handing his daughter [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 47606**], or talking about
seeing a skunk. His wife thought he may have been having visual
hallucinations while in the outside hospital.
Initially, he was sent in an ambulance to [**Hospital1 18**], but due to his
increasing respiratory distress, he was sent to [**Hospital1 498**] first.
There, he initially presented with T 97.3, BP 152/97, HR 60, RR
20, SaO2 93%/3L. He was given albuterol nebs, seemingly without
significant improvement. An arterial blood gas was 7.19/71/79
and he was intubated. He was given a dose of meropenem. Around
the same time as intubation and treatment, he became
hypotensive. He was started on a dopamine gtt.
When he arrived at [**Hospital1 18**], he was hypotensive with SBPs 60-70,
and was started on levophed, vasopressin and dopamine. He was
also given 3L fluid bolus.

5. hypertension
6. history of childhood asthma - hospitalized but not intubated
7. chronic C. difficile

Social History:
Married with two children. Not able to work currently secondary
to his illness but previously he worked as an administrator for
the VNA service in [**Hospital1 1559**],  a tax accountant, and an ICU
nurse. Distant tobacco (pipe, quit 20 years ago), no cigarettes,
ETOH or illicit drug use.


Family History:
No family history of leukemia/lymphoma.
Mother with renal disease, on HD.
Father died suddenly at 63, presumed to be secondary to MI.

Abdominal u/s: 1. Gallbladder wall thickening and gallstones
seen in the neck of the gallbladder consistent with
cholecystitis. Given lack of distention, other possible
etiologies include CHF, ascites, and hypoproteinemia should be
considered.

Brief Hospital Course:
Assessment: 51yo man with acute promyelocytic leukemia s/p bone
marrow transplant complicated by extensive graft vs. host
disease including bronchiolitis obliterans, history of
pseudomonas PNA, sputum growing resistant stenotrophomonas, and
aspergillus colonization, who was admitted to the ICU with
respiratory failure and found to be hypotensive as well.

Hospital course is discussed below by problem:

1. Respiratory failure - The most likely etiology of the
respiratory failure was a pneumonia on the background of
significant pulmonary disease (bronchiolitis obliterans with
severely depressed FEV1 and FVC). Given his severe
immunocompromise, he was covered for infection by bacteria
(including pseudomonas and resistant stenotrophomonas), fungus,
or PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) 227**] his penicillin allergy, he was treated with
vancomycin, ciprofloxacin, aztreonam (changed from tobramycin),
IV flagyl, voriconazole, and IV bactrim. Colistin was
considered, but given its significant toxicity, it was not
started and was awaiting stenotrophomonas sensitivities. He had
cultures drawn, a BAL was considered. He was thought to likely
have ARDS secondary to sepsis, and the ARDS protocol for
ventilator settings was attempted, but he did not tolerate these
settings and became hypoxemic and acidemic. He was thus
ventilated with larger volumes. He was additionally treated with
albuterol, atrovent, and flovent. He required escalating FiO2,
evantually at 100%, and remained with persistent acidosis.

2. Hypotension - On arrival to the ICU, the patient was found to
be hypotensive. The first BP read was 150/120, but then he was
found to have a kinked blood pressure cuff. The more accurate
[**Location (un) 1131**] was in the 70s/30s. While placing an arterial line, his
blood pressure began to fall. He had been switched from dopamine
to levophed, vasopressin was added, and the dopamine restarted.
He was given over 5 liters of fluid with eventual stabilization
of his blood pressure with MAPs in the 50s. Most likely, the
hypotension was secondary to septic shock. Other possibilities
include tamponade, which was not evidenced by ECHO. Pulmonary
embolus was considered, but was less likely given his CXR. He
was likely adrenally insufficient, given his outpatient regimen
including prednisone, so he was started on stress-dose steroids.

3. Acidosis - He was found to have a significant acidosis. This
was thought to be secondary to lactic acidosis, nongap acidosis
from normal saline boluses, and respiratory abnormalities. His
ventilator was set to attempt to correct the acidosis, but his
blood pressure and hypoxia were confounding factors.

4. Acute promyelocytic leukemia with graft vs. host disease - He
was continued on acyclovir, IV voriconazole, ursodiol,
ophthalmic ointment. He was given stress dose steroids and
started on GCSF. The bone marrow transplant team followed
throughout his hospital course.
