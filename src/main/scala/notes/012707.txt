Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Vancomycin

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 826**]
Chief Complaint:
LE edema and syncope 4 days ago

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac catheterization
PD catheter replacement

History of Present Illness:
72 yo M who presented with LE and scrotal edema x 4 days and
syncopal episode 4 days ago.  Patient states that his PD
catheter has not been working properly during the same time; he
reports putting in 2L dialysate and only getting 1L fluid out.
This occurred in [**12-5**] requiring laparascopic repositioning of
PD catheter on [**2186-1-5**].
.
Patient also reports 2 syncopal episodes in the past week.  He
denies feeling lightheaded, palpitations, pain, or SOB prior to
episodes.  He denies post-ictal confusion or incontinence.  He
denies head trauma, but reports falling on his elbow and back.
He complains of left elbow pain along with some low back pain.
He reports a prior episode of syncope in [**9-/2184**], resulting in
CABG and AICD placement.  In [**2-6**] he had a p-MIBI showing
mod-severe partially reversible perfusion defect in the inferior
wall.  He had frequent episodes of AFib and was restarted on
amiodarone.  He had his AICD interrogated by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on
[**2186-3-10**].  He denies any chest pain/pressure, SOB, N/V/D, or F/C.

.
In the [**Name (NI) **], pt had positive troponin.  Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 34293**] talked to the
on-call cardiology fellow, and in the setting of ARF he did not
feel that this was due to an acute coronary event.
.
ROS: Pt reports having a URI with cough last week.  He also
admits to 2 pillow orthopnea, no PND.  He is able to walk up one
flight of stairs; no change in his exercise tolerance.


Past Medical History:
CABG x 3: LIMA-LAD, SVG-OM, SVG-Diag in [**9-4**] at [**Location (un) 7349**] [**Hospital1 **] after
presenting with loss of consciousness.  Followed by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **]
[**Name (STitle) **].

Social History:
He lives alone, has family in [**Location (un) **].  He emigrated from [**Location (un) 30926**] in [**2172**].  He denies cigarette, alcohol or drug use.  He
does occasionally take Chinese herbal medicines.

Family History:
His parents are both deceased of unclear cause.
He has two siblings, both deceased of unclear cause.  He has
three children ranging in age from 40-47.  He is not able to

Cardiac: RRR S1/S2 no murmurs
Abdomen: Increased distension, soft, NT, PD cath in place. +BS
Ext: +2 pitting edema upto knee and + scrotal edema
Neuro: AAOx3, no wrist flap

Pertinent Results:
CXR [**3-28**]: 1. Markedly tortuous aorta.  2. Patchy opacity in left
lower lobe, which may represent atelectasis; however, pneumonia
cannot be excluded.  3. Prominent gas below the right
hemidiaphragm, probably representing air fluid level in the
colon; however, clinical correlation recommended.  4. Small left
effusion.
.
Xray L-S spine [**3-28**]: Marked degenerative changes.  No definite
evidence of fracture.  Gallstones. Spinous processes are not
well visualized on this study.
.
Xray elbow [**3-28**]: Well-corticated bone fragment at medial
epicondyle, which may represent avulsion fracture; however, the
finding is unlikely to be acute.
.
PD fluid [**3-29**]: 588 WBC, 93 RBC, 50% PMN, 45% lymph
PD fluid gram stain [**3-29**]: 1+ PMN, no organisms
PD fluid cx [**3-29**]: negative
PD fluid [**3-30**]: 490 WBC, 400 RBC, 42% PMN, 17% lymph
PD fluid gram stain [**3-30**]: 1+ PMN, no organisms
PD fluid cx [**3-30**]: negative
PD fluid [**4-1**]: 240 WBC, 1145 RBC, 80% PMN
.
KUB [**3-30**]: Free intra-abdominal air under the right
hemidiaphragm.
Peritoneal dialysis catheter in the left lower quadrant.  Unable
to determine if it is occluded on these plain film radiographs.
.
Abd CT [**4-2**]: 1.  Bilateral moderately sized pleural effusions and
associated basilar atelectasis.
2.  Large amount of abdominal and pelvic ascites.  The fluid
measures density values of approximately 10 Hounsfield units or
less, which is consistent with ascites, rather than hemorrhage.
There is no sentinel clot sign seen.  However, it is difficult
to exclude that an intraperitoneal hemorrhage has mixed with
pre-existing ascites and therefore has low-density values.  The
ascites is mostly intra-abdominal with sparing of the
retroperitoneum.
3.  Small umbilical hernia.
4.  Diverticulosis, without evidence of diverticulitis.
.
Cath [**4-3**]: 1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Patent SVG --> OM2.
3. Patent SVG --> diagonal.
4. Patent LIMA --> LAD.
5. Mildly elevated left ventricular filling pressures.
6. Systemic hypertension.
7. Small left to right shunt at the level of the right atrium.
.
Echo [**3-29**]: LA is mildly dilated.  Mild symmetric LVH.  Mild
global LV hypokinesis; lateral wall moves best.  Overall LV
systolic function is mildly depressed (45%).  E/e' is elevated
(>15) suggesting increased LV filling pressure (PCWP >18mmHg).
RV systolic function is borderline normal.  Aortic root is
moderately dilated.  Ascending aorta is moderately dilated.
Aortic arch is mildly dilated.  Aortic valve leaflets are mildly
thickened.  Mild to moderate ([**1-2**]+) AR is seen.  Mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened.  Mild to moderate ([**1-2**]+) MR is
seen. [the severity of MR may be significantly UNDERestimated.]
Moderate [2+] TR is seen.  Severe PA systolic hypertension.
Significant pulmonic regurgitation is seen.  Compared with prior
[**2185-8-15**], LV systolic function is now less vigorous and MR is
more prominent.  Estimated PA systolic pressure is much higher.

.
CXR [**4-1**]: The lung volumes are low, but the lungs are clear.
Deviation of the trachea to the right is partly attributable to
the tortuous aorta.  No effusion.  No significant interval
change.
.
KUB [**4-5**]: The peritoneal dialysis catheter is seen coiled in the
left mid abdomen.  It has not changed in position or appearance
since the prior exam.
.
CXR [**2186-4-12**] - Slight increase in left pleural effusion, now
moderate in size. Persistent small right pleural effusion.
U/S LUE [**2186-4-14**]-No evidence of DVT.


Brief Hospital Course:
72 yo M with ESRD on PD, s/p CABG, and AICD who presented with
LE and scrotal edema, syncopal episode, elevated troponin, and
ARF.  Patient's edema is likely related to PD catheter
dysfunction, either from clot, fibrin blockage, catheter
displacement, or infection.  Syncope may be explained by drop
attack from decreased venous return.  However, patient's prior
history of cardiogenic syncope is concerning for AICD
malfunction, arrhythmia, or ACS.
.
## Syncope: Unclear etiology.  [**Month (only) 116**] be explained by drop attack
from decreased venous return.  EP consulted to interrogate AICD:
working well with no episodes of AFib.  Neuro consultants felt
that peripheral neuropathy causing poor proprioception, cervical
spondylosis and nighttime dialysis causing increased tiredness
(no seizures).  Echo with PA HTN and decr EF, thought to be from
volume overload.  TSH elev with nl T4 (may be due to amiodarone,
reassess in [**1-2**] mos), nl B12 and folate, nl HbA1c, nl SPEP.
UPEP with multiple protein bands but no monoclonal Ig.
.
## CAD: On admission, Trop was likely elevated in setting of ARF
and CK elevated [**2-2**] to fall; troponin trended down twice.  Cards
felt that EKG changes were minimal.  He was ruled out for MI.
He underwent Cardiac Cath on [**4-3**] which showed patent stents.  He
was continued on ASA, lipitor, BBlocker.  ACEI deffered
initially given Renal Insufficiency.  Given his history of CAD,
Plavix was started on discharge.
.
## Acute on chronic renal failure: Acute renal insufficiency on
