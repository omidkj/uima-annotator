Service:  Vascular

HOSPITAL COURSE:
The patient is an 87-year-old Russian speaking female who was
admitted to the hospital on [**2185-2-20**] to the Vascular Service
with a nonhealing ulcer on her fourth right toe x3 months.
Patient underwent a fem-[**Doctor Last Name **] bypass by Vascular Surgery on
[**2185-2-26**].  Postoperatively in the PACU, the patient developed
some respiratory distress and had a PEA arrest with very
difficult intubation and was noted to have severe laryngeal
edema.  She subsequently was resuscitated and transferred to
the SICU.  While in the SICU, she was ruled out for a
myocardial infarction.  On [**2185-3-1**] bronchoscopy was done
which showed significant glottic edema.  She was thus started
on Decadron.

She was kept intubated until [**2185-3-7**] at which time she was
extubated.  She was extubated and doing okay until [**2185-3-14**]
at which point she became stridorous with respiratory failure
and was intubated.  Laryngoscopy was done and showed no
edema.

CT scan was done on [**2185-3-16**] which showed subglottic stenosis
versus possible edema.  Due to this edema, percutaneous trach
was attempted and a posterior tracheal tear occurred.  She
was then started on broad-spectrum antibiotics with a fever
of 101.6.

Since that point, she had then received a surgical trach and
was successfully extubated on [**2185-3-22**] and has done well with
trach mask since.  A nasogastric tube was placed for tube
feeds and TPN, and that has been continuing currently.  Once
the trach mask had been placed, she was doing well.  Over the
next several days, she did spike with low-grade fevers and
also had elevated white count.  Her central line was removed
and cultures were taken.  Cultures grew out Staphylococcus
aureus.  Patient was placed on Vancomycin.  Due to the fact
that this would be given long-term, it was decided that a
PICC line would be placed.  PICC line was attempted on
[**2185-3-28**] by IV team.  They were unable to place it in the
patient's room.  It was thus decided that it would placed
under fluoroscopy.

On [**2185-3-29**], the patient was taken to Interventional
Radiology at which time a PICC line was placed in the
patient's left arm that was in good working condition.

Currently the patient is doing okay.  She is running
occasional low-grade fevers.  She is currently on trach air
mask.  She does have a small dehiscence on her right inner
thigh, which are being treated with wet-to-dry dressing
changes [**Hospital1 **].

The patient does also have coarse rhonchi in both lungs.  She
has copious secretions coming from her trach mask.  Bronch
was offered to the family, who denied having that done as she
is undergoing suctioning currently by the nurses.

Currently her issues are that coarse rhonchi, her infection
is being treated with Vancomycin and Flagyl.  She also in her
right inner thigh which was earlier mentioned, and was
treated with wet-to-dry dressing changes and will close by
secondary intention.
