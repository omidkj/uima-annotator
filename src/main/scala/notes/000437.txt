Chest and Abdominal Pain

History of Present Illness:
62 year old male with a pmh of ESRD s/p failed graft on HD, Hep
C genotype 1, DMII, HTN, HLD who presents from an OSH with
pericarditis complicated by pericardial effusion.
.
His OSH course is as follows:
He had an admission prior to this [**Date range (1) 27855**] with pleuritic CP
and rub, diagnosed with pericarditis. Also, new LBBB and tropI
of 0.125. Echo showed small effusion and normal wall motion,
mild AS, mild MR, unchanged from baseline. He was treated with
NSAIDs. Due to LBBB, prolonged PR and underlying dCHF (between
dialysis sessions) his dilt was stopped and coreg (3.125) was
added. He was discharged on 50mg TID of indocin.
.
Several days after discharge he developed general weakness,
vague diffuse low abd pain, and fatigue. Dialysis was
complicated by hypotension (new) and required fluid. [**8-2**]
admitted to OSH with hypotension of 75/50 and above symptoms. He
was fluid resuscitated, fluid responsive. CT A/P showed
diverticulosis (no inflammation) and a mod pericardial effusion
(incidental). RUQ U/S with GB wall thickening, otherwise
unremarkable.
.
He was admitted to the ICU, BPs maintained 100s-140s and HRs
50s-70s. Treated presumptively for adrenal insufficiency with
hydrocortisone. Echo showed circuferential pericardial effusion
(2.1-2.2 cm) reportedly without evidence of tamponade.  His
vitals remained stable and his labs were unremarkable (stable
anemia HCT ~30) and WBC elevation of 19 after steroids.
Creatinine 8.9, sodium 131.  He was transferred from OSH
([**Hospital1 1562**]) to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.
.
At [**Hospital1 18**], he was admitted to inpatient medicine.  He is
comfortable without any acute complaints. He does still have
mild chest discomfort that has persisted throughout his
admission at the OSH. He also has vague lower abdominal pain,
but is otherwise without any acute complaints. No SOB, no
orthopnea, no PND.

Past Medical History:
1. CARDIAC RISK FACTORS: + Diabetes, + Dyslipidemia,
+Hypertension
2. OTHER PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
- ESRD secondary to FSGN, s/p failed graft placement and now
temporarily off of the [**Hospital1 **] list (due to current illness)
on hemodialysis from FSGS; AV graft is thrombosed (he is
dialyzed now through temp groin line)
- Hepatitis C genotype 1, biopsy showed fibrosis grade I
- Gout
- s/p Partial parathyroidectomy (adenoma)
- Neuropathy


Social History:
