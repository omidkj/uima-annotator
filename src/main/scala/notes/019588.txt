Diarrhea and hypotension

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
This is a 86 y/o male with a h/o CAD, CHF (EF 30-40%), HTN, MDS,
recent admission in [**7-13**] for diarrhea and treated
presumptively for c diff given his past history of c diff
enterocolitis, who now presents to the ED with
n/v/weakness/dehydration/diarrhea/epigastric abd pain x 24
hours. Pt also had one episode of emesis (no blood) yesterday.
He is still on his course of flagyl from recent admission, but
has missed the last few doses due to outpt pharmacy issues.
.
In the [**Name (NI) **], pt was noted to have an elevated lipase and amylase
of 557 and 900, respectively. He was also noted to have an
elevated lactate of 3.2 and a positive u/a with 6-10 wbc's,
trace leuks, neg nitrates. He was initially to be admitted to
medicine, however pt dropped his SBP from 110 to 90,
asymptomatic. Received 500 cc with good response and current SBP
in the 100's. Received a total of 1 L NS. He was given
Vanc/CTX/flagyl in the ED for h/o MRSA, positive u/a, and recent
h/o c diff enterocolitis ([**4-10**]).
.
Currently, through aid of daughter translating, pt denies any
f/c/s, dizziness/lightheadedness, chest pain, SOB, palpitations,
n/v, abdominal pain, urinary symptoms. +generalized weakness,
but not much different from baseline. +diarrhea, no
BRBPR/hematochezia/melena.
.
The patient was transferred to the medicine service [**2116-7-6**]. His
diarrhea was improving and he had no complaints at that time.

CT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST [**2116-7-3**]
IMPRESSION:
1.  Diffusely swollen pancreas consistent with mild pancreatitis
without peripancreatic fluid collections noted.
2.  Mildly atrophic kidneys with diffuse calcification of the
renal artery ostia are noted.  MRA of the renal artery is
recommended bilaterally if clinical suspicious for stenosis.
3.  Diffuse rectal, sigmoid, and descending colon wall
thickening suggestive of colitis.
4.  Enlarged paraaortic lymph nodes noted on previous exam,
unchanged and of unknown significance.
.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP) [**2116-7-3**]
IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to [**2116-6-18**]:
Lungs are clear.  Heart size normal.  No pleural abnormality or
evidence of central adenopathy.  Right hemidiaphragm is
persistently elevated given part to interposition of the hepatic
flexure of the colon between diaphragm and liver.
.
CT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST  [**2116-7-8**]
IMPRESSION:
1. Again seen is stranding around the pancreas, consistent with
pancreatitis. There appears to be some interval increase in the
degree of stranding within the small bowel mesentery, and along
the pericolic gutters. There is a small amount of fluid along
the pericolic gutters and within the pelvis, which is slightly
increased from the prior study. No focal abscesses are
identified.
2. There are bilateral pleural effusions which also have
increased slightly in comparison to the prior study. The
remainder of the exam is unchanged.
.
Blood draws were discontinued when the decision was made for
CMO.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 86 yoM with PMH CAD, ischemic cardiomyopathy, MDS, recent
admission for presumed C. difficile colitis, admitted to the
MICU with diarrhea and hypotension admitted to floor [**7-6**]. After
family meetings to address goals of care in this patient with
chronic pain and MDS most likely with leukemic transformation,
not likely a candidate for therapy per hematology, the patient
was made DNR/DNI/CMO.
.
1. Diarrhea. The diarrhea continued to improve with decreased
stool number and volume on the floor. CT abdomen [**7-3**] showed
diffuse rectal, sigmoid, and descending colon wall thickening
suggestive of colitis. With the patient's elevated WBC, there
was concern for an infectious source. His stool cultures were
negative x2 and C. difficile toxin was negative x3, however, the
patient had a history of recent antibiotic use. The original
plan with the GI consult team was to perform a colonoscopy once
the patient was stable to elucidate the cause of the diarrhea;
this was no longer necessary as the patient is CMO. The
patient's initial antibiotic treatment included levofloxacin and
flagyl on admission. The patient continued to spike fevers
despite antibiotic treatment. Levofloxacin was discontinued and
ceftriaxone was started to broaden coverage [**7-8**]. Infectious
disease was consulted to comment on antibiotic coverage. Flagyl
was discontinued [**7-9**], with vancomycin IV started [**7-9**]. Vancomycin
by mouth and imipenum was started [**7-10**]. The patient was continued
on vancomycin IV and by mouth and imipenum until the decision
was made for the patient to be CMO [**7-16**]. The patient was kept
hydrated intravenously and with free water boluses through his
feeding tube to replace his GI losses.
.
2. Fever/leukocytosis. The patient was started on levofloxacin
and flagyl for presumptive infectious colitis, with antibiotic
changes as above per ID recommendations. Blood cultures taken
[**7-3**], [**7-4**], [**7-5**], [**7-7**], [**7-8**] were negative. Urine cultures 7/28,
[**7-4**], [**7-5**] were negative. Multiple chest x-rays were within
normal limits. An echocardiogram did not show evidence of
endocarditis. As above, the patient continued to spike low grade
fevers despite treatment with antibiotics. The patient's white
blood cells at baseline were 19-25 thought secondary to MDS. The
white blood cell count elevated to 80s on this admission.
Hematology felt that the patient's blood smears were concerning
for leukemic transformation of the MDS. Cytology was sent prior
to the decision for CMO and was pending at the time of
discharge.
.
3. MDS. Hematology/oncology followed the patient during
hospitalization. The team confirmed the diagnosis of MDS from
his original smear. This was an atypical presentation as the
patient was di
