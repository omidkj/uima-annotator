PHYSICAL EXAM:  On presentation, the patient's vital signs
were 97.9, 84, 107/51, 20, and 96% on 3 liters by nasal
cannula.  Physical exam was notable for irregular heart rate
and clear lungs with an expiratory wheeze.  Patient had an
obese soft abdomen with a well-healed midline incision as
well as a paramedian scar with a possibility of a
supraumbilical incisional hernia.  Patient had 1+ bilateral
lower extremity edema.

LABORATORIES:  On admission, the patient's white count was
7.8, hematocrit 30.2, platelet count 313.  Coagulation
studies were normal.  Chemistries were also normal with a
creatinine of 0.8.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  On arrival in her hospital room, the
patient was evaluated by Surgery house officer.  An immediate
EKG was obtained, which revealed no evidence of ischemia.
Patient was given some sublingual nitroglycerin, which
appeared to relieve some of her shortness of breath.  Cardiac
enzymes were drawn with three sets sent.  Cardiac enzymes
were negative.  Consultations were requested from the
Pulmonary service as well as the Cardiology service.

As part of the workup of the patient's lung mass, the patient
underwent a CAT scan of her chest, which confirmed the
finding of a left upper lobe lung mass.  Patient was noted to
have some hilar and mediastinal lymphadenopathy.  A CAT scan
of the patient's head revealed no evidence of metastases.
Bronchoscopy of the patient performed by the Pulmonary
service on the day following admission revealed
tracheobronchomalacia with an endobronchial tumor noted in
the distal left main stem bronchus.  No biopsy was attempted.

Patient was seen by the Cardiology service.  Echocardiogram
was obtained, which was essentially normal.  The patient's
chest pain was ultimately deemed noncardiac in origin and no
further workup was recommended.

Patient was taken to the OR on [**2139-5-8**] with intention to
perform a mediastinoscopy, bronchoscopy, and possible
Chamberlain procedure.  Patient underwent the bronchoscopy
and mediastinoscopy.  Patient tolerated the procedure well.
The patient was transferred to the Post Anesthesia Care Unit
while intubated with intention on extubating her the
following day.  The patient was confirmed to have via
tracheobronchomalacia during an intraoperative bronchoscopy.

The patient was extubated as planned on postoperative day #1.
Her oxygen saturations remained in the 93-96% range on 3
liters by nasal cannula.

By postoperative day #2, the patient was doing very well.
Her pain was well controlled.  Her oxygen saturations were
stable on 3 liters by nasal cannula.  Discharge planning was
initiated, and the patient was ultimately discharged on
postoperative day #3.

The patient had been seen on hospital day #2 by the Podiatry
service for examination of her feet and nails.  Patient was
confirmed to have some onychomycosis, and was started on an
antifungal medication for this.
