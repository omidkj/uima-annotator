Pertinent Results:
[**2196-2-29**] Echo: PREBYPASS: The left atrium is dilated. No atrial
septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Regional left
ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Transgastric view could
not be obtained. The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated
with normal free wall contractility. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) are mildly thickened. There are filamentous strands on the
aortic leaflets consistent with Lambl's excresences (normal
variant). Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Physiologic mitral regurgitation
is seen (within normal limits). The pericardium appears
thickened. There are pericardial calcifications. The echo
findings are suggestive but not diagnostic of pericardial
constriction.
POST BYPASS: Biventricular systolic function remains preserved.

Radiology Report CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2196-3-2**]
11:55 AM
Final Report
HISTORY: Chest tubes removed. Rule out pneumothorax.
IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**3-2**]:
Since [**3-2**], major cardiopulmonary support devices have
all been
removed, left lower lobe atelectasis has worsened, though the
small overall lung volumes are unchanged. A slight interval
increase in the
cardiomediastinal diameter is a common finding after cardiac
surgery. No
pneumothorax.

Preliminary Report !! WET READ !!
A 9.6 x 8 cm loculated left pleural high density collection
represents
hematoma, possibly with moderate mass effect on the left
ventricle - Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 914**] reviewed and spoke with radiologist -
left pleural hematoma noted -patient cleared for discharge
[**2196-3-4**]:
Right femoral US: small hematoma at cannulation site with no
vessel compression - WET REAS


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 50343**] was a same day admit after undergoing pre-operative
work-up as an outpatient. On day of admission he was brought
directly to the operating room where he underwent a
pericardiectomy with a bypass time of 105 minutes. Please see
operative report for surgical details.
Following surgery he was transferred to the CVICU for invasive
monitoring in stable condition. Within 24 hours he was weaned
from sedation, awoke neurologically intact and extubated. On
post-operative day one he remained hemodynamically stable and
was transferred to the step-down floor for further care.
Coumadin was restarted for atrial fibrillation. Chest tubes and
epicardial pacing wires were removed per cardiac surgery
protocols. He was seen by the hepatology service and had a
paracentesis for 3500 cc's during his hospital stay. He
complained post operatively of right leg stabbing pain and right
thigh paresthesia. He was started on Neurontin.  Neurology was
consulted and it was thought that the paresthesia was a direct
result of the femoral vein cannulation. A right femoral
ultrasound was performed which revealed only a small hematoma
with no pseudoaneurysm or fistula noted.  The pain was improving
at the time of discharge. Neurology recommended continuing
Neurontin with follow up in clinic in 4 weeks if symptoms
persist.  He continued to progress with activity level and was
discharged home with visiting nurses on [**3-4**]. He is to have his
INR checked by VNA on [**3-6**] with results called to Dr[**Name (NI) 670**]
office. Follow up with Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 914**] in 1 month.
