CLOSTRIDIUM DIFFICILE TOXIN A & B TEST (Final [**2163-4-26**]):
Feces negative for C.difficile toxin A & B by EIA.

CTA:

Endoscopy capsule is seen within the cecum. Other findings,
including open
abdomen, subcapsular liver hematoma/seroma, pleural effusions,
and bibasilar atelectasis are unchanged. As seen previously, the
[**Female First Name (un) 899**] does not fill but the SMA and Celiac axes are patent.

VIDEO SWALLOW:

FINDINGS: Barium passes freely through the oropharynx and
esophagus without evidence of obstruction. There was no gross
aspiration or penetration. For details, please refer to speech
and swallow division note in OMR.

IMPRESSION: Normal oropharyngeal swallowing videofluoroscopy.



Brief Hospital Course:
[**2163-4-20**]

65M s/p TAAA repair, c/b paraplegia and mesenteric ischemia
requiring left colectomy and colostomy, abdominal wall closure
with split-thickness skin-grafts. Presents with concerns of
discoloration at the superior aspect of his wound felt to be
benign and hypotension likely discontinuation of his midodrine
and initiation of beta-blockers.  Pt. otherwise stable

Pt admitted to VICU

Resumed cipro / fluconazol / flagyl through out the hospital
course.

Pan cx'd

CT SCAN obtained:

IMPRESSION:

1. Stable appearance of the thoracoabdominal aortic graft, with
a small
amount of fluid collection surrounding the graft.
2. Status post total colectomy and right lower quadrant
ileostomy, without
bowel obstruction or secondary signs of mesenteric ischemia.
Evaluation for
ischemia is limited due to the lack of intravenous contrast.
3. The tracheostomy tube and central lines are in optimal
position.
4. Secretions within the trachea, concerning for aspiration.
Complete
collapse of the left lower lobe with abrupt cutoff of the left
lower lobe
bronchus, question mucous plug versus aspiration.
5. Bilateral moderate-sized pleural effusions, with associated
right basilar
atelectasis, slightly larger since the prior study.

With the discontinuation of BB and  middorone hypotension
resolved.

TF clamped for egd vs scope

HCT still low, blood at osteum site. GI consulted. TF held for
possible scope. Pt recieved CTA to rule out aortic enteric
fistula, fundaperinox held for scope. Pt given NAHCO3 for renal
protection

CTA:

1. Moderate bilateral pleural effusions.
2. Limited evaluation for contrast exacerbation into the bowel
due to the
presence of oral contrast from a prior examination.
3. Unchanged left flank simple fluid collection.
4. The balloon of the GJ tube appears to be inflated outside the
stomach
wall. Clinical correlation recommended.
