Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2969**]
Chief Complaint:
Lung Cancer

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Left lower lobe non-small cell lung cancer, Left vocal cord
paralysis
7/5 L VATS pleuroscopy & mediastinoscopy (neg med nodes)
7/12 L thoracotomy/LLL lobectomy, L chest wall resect with
gortex mesh repair, LUL wedge resect


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 14859**] is an 81-year-old gentleman with a
biopsy proven carcinoma of the left lower lobe, which by
imaging abuts the chest wall. On his prior visit, he underwent a
staging operation which showed no nodes involved and a
pleural effusion negative for malignancy, with negative
pleural biopsies. He had adequate reserve to tolerate
resection and was surprisingly asymptomatic regarding the
tumor, which was clearly adherent if not invading the chest
wall. We recommended left lower lobectomy with en bloc chest
wall resection and he agreed to proceed.

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:

REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:

PA and lateral chest, [**9-1**].
HISTORY: Left lower lobectomy and chest wall repair, left upper
lobe wedge resection. Chest tube discontinued.
IMPRESSION: PA and lateral chest compared to [**8-30**]:
Left posterior air and fluid collection in the region of chest
wall resection has increased in size, predominantly in the
anteroposterior dimension from roughly 31 to 39 mm in diameter,
still between 10.5 and 12 cm in length, and now contains a large
component of fluid. There is no appreciable layering left
pleural effusion or significant pneumothorax along the other
pleural margins. Subcutaneous emphysema in the left
supraclavicular soft tissues has diminished. Small right pleural
effusion is stable. Right lung is clear. Heart is top normal
size and remains shifted slightly to the left. Transvenous pacer
lead in standard position.
RADIOLOGY  Final Report

VIDEO OROPHARYNGEAL SWALLOW  [**2123-8-31**] 11:13 AM
Reason: eval for swallow prophiciency.

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
81 year old man with left vocal cord paralysis per ENT [**8-30**] s./p
Thoracic surgery, meds/ lobectomy.
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
eval for swallow prophiciency.
INDICATIONS: 81-year-old man with left vocal cord paralysis
following thoracic surgery.

TECHNIQUE: Videotaped oropharyngeal swallowing study.

FINDINGS: The study was performed in conjunction with the speech
and swallow pathologist. Various consistencies of barium were
administered under videofluoroscopy. Due to poor bolus control,
premature spillover was observed into the piriform sinuses with
thin liquids. Laryngeal valve closure was mildly impaired, and
the left vocal cord showed paralysis. Residue in the piriform
sinuses and valleculae could be cleared with multiple swallows.
Pharyngeal contraction was symmetric. Mild penetration with sips
of thin liquids was observed with spillover, but throat clearing
was effective.

A moderate amount of silent aspiration was observed with
multiple sips of thin liquids, related to spillover, and cough
was not effective at clearance. Also, there was reduced
sensation with a lack of spontaneous cough. This aspiration
occurred with larger boluses only. With smaller boluses of thin
liquids via straw, only trace penetration was observed.

IMPRESSION: Moderate aspiration with larger boluses of thin
liquids, with only penetration into the vestibules seen at
smaller boluses. Paralysis of left vocal cord.

SUMMARY:
Pt presents with a mild oropharyngeal dysphagia.  He
demonstrated
aspiration and penetration with thin liquids during the
examination, however, small bolus sizes were effective at
preventing aspiration when pt was focused on the swallowing
task.
Pt also demonstrated deep penetration with small straw sips of
thin liquids.  In consideration of pt's left vocal cord paresis,
it is very likely that this is the cause of his poor valve
closure and thus compromising his airway protection with larger
boluses.  Therefore, based on this examination, it is
recommended
that pt continue with a regular PO diet with thin liquids while
taking small sips of thin liquids and NO STRAWS.  Pt
demonstrated
a good understanding of the instructions given after the
evaluation.  We will follow-up with the pt to ensure that these
instructions are being followed at meals.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. recommend that pt continue on regular PO diet with thin
liquids and PO meds
2. pt should take small sips of thin liquids
3. Pt should not use straws
