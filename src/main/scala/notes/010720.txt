Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Codeine

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1145**]
Chief Complaint:
shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Direct current cardioversion
Transesophageal echocardiogram


History of Present Illness:
Pt is an 89F with history of HTN, hypothyroidism. She was
hospitalized at [**Hospital **] rehab for a femur fracture [**1-21**]. She had
been doing well until this evening at approximately 9-10pm when
while resting she noted acute onset respiratory distress. When
EMS arrived she was hypoxic to 82% on RA, this improved to 100%
when placed on a NRB, she was also noted to be hypertensive in
the field to 233/96. On arrival to our ED she was tachycardic in
AF, initial VS: 98.4 190/100 110-120 (AF) 36 100% on NRB. She
had a CXR which showed CHF and cardiomegaly and had a CTA due to
concern for PE which was negative for PE, showed CHF and
cardiomegaly. She received 1 dose of levaquinShe was initially
given lasix 20mg IV [**Doctor Last Name **] a nitro gtt. Minimal UOP at this point.
Became hypotensive on nitro gtt necessitating 500 IVF bolus, in
addition to pre-contrast hydration, at which point she put out
~500cc urine. She was started on a heparin gtt for her AF with a
bolus. She was given kayexelate for a K of 6.1 and received to
doses of 10 units insulin for FSBS 300-400s in the setting of
getting D5 with her bicarb infusion. She was placed on CPAP, to
which she responded to, 02 sats 100%. Switched back to NRB, ABG:
7.33/53.289. Arrived on the floor on NRB.
.
On floor, pt reports her breathing is much improved, she is
sleeping comfortably sitting up with mask around her neck.
Denies any pain, palpitations. No recent illnesses or medication
changes. Reports noting increased LE edema, but her her daughter
she does not appreciate a significant change.

Shoulder x-ray - FINDINGS: In comparison with earlier study of
this date, the humeral fracture is again seen with marked
overlap of the head with the proximal shaft. On the right
axillary view, the humeral head appears to be in reasonable
relation to the glenoid fossa.
.
Multiple opacifications are seen about the humeral head. It is
unclear
whether this is related to the previous fracture or to some
other pathology involving the joint. Comparison with previous
films at an outside hospital would be most helpful.
.
INDICATION: Check for fracture progression.

FINDINGS: There are no old films. There is a fracture at the
surgical neck
of the humerus. There is overlap of the humeral head with the
proximal shaft. Based on these views, I cannot completely
determine the seating of the humeral head within the glenoid.
Comparison with old x-rays, unavailable on PACS at the time of
interpretation, could be useful.
.
TEE - The left atrium is mildly dilated. No spontaneous echo
contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium/left
atrial appendage or the body of the right atrium/right atrial
appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color
Doppler. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF>55%). The descending thoracic aorta was milldy dilated.
There is simple plaque in the arch and descending thoracic
aorta. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+)
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There
is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: No thrombus in the LA/LAA. Mild mitral
regurgitation. Mild aortic regurgitation. Simple aortic plaque
in arch and descending thoracic aorta.
.
CTA chest - IMPRESSION:
1. No central or segmental pulmonary embolus. Evaluation of the
subsegmental pulmonary arteries, especially in the lung bases is
limited by respiratory motion.
2. Cardiomegaly, bilateral pleural effusions, and reflux of
intravenous contrast into the hepatic veins. The constellationo
of these findings is suggestive of congestive heart failure.
3. Left adrenal adenoma.
4. Small nodules in the right upper lobe measuring up to 6 mm.
Recommend
followup at 6-12 months to ensure stability.





Brief Hospital Course:
89F with PMH significant for HTN, hypothyroidism, no prior
cardiac history presenting with new AF, CHF.
.
# RHYTHM:  Suspect that atrial fibrillation is new as never
documented before and pt markedly symptomatic.  Likely she was
dependent on her atrial kick in setting of probable depressed
cardiac function.  In terms of work-up for new onset atrial
fibrillation, patient had TSH checked on admission 0.95 which is
WNL. For infectious wrk-up patient had CTA which demonstrated
effusions but no obvious infiltrate. Got Levaquin in the ED
which was not continued on admission. Patient without fever,
elevation in white count or other localizing symptoms to suggest
infection. Initially patient on diltiazem drip which was
discontinued as was dropping pressures.  Patient underwent TEE
which demonstrated no atrial thrombus, patient then underwent
subsequent cardioversion. Patient did convert to sinus briefly
and then went back into atrial fibrillation on [**2101-2-11**]. Spoke
with EP regarding management, decision to start amiodarone as
anti-arrythmic in addition to beta blocker.  Patient was started
on coumadin and in house given IV heparin.   Beta blocker being
titrated up as tolerated by heart rate and blood pressure.  Plan
on discharge is that patient will have repeat cardioversion as
outpatient with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] at the end of [**Month (only) 956**]. Dr. [**Name (NI) 22720**] secretary is trying to get a date for this and they
will contact the pat
