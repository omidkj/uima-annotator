IMAGING:
[**2170-7-13**]: R tibia/fibula:  Angulated fracture of the lower tibia
and fibula.
[**2170-7-18**]: CTA Chest: 1. No pulmonary embolism. 2.
Mild-to-moderate bibasilar atelectasis.  Small, right greater
than left pleural effusions.  3. Tracheomalacia with near
complete collapse of the mid trachea during
expiration.
[**2170-7-21**]: CXR: In comparison with the study of [**9-18**], there are
continued low lung volumes with enlargement of the cardiac
silhouette and some evidence of vascular congestion.
Opacification at the left base most likely represents
atelectasis and there are small bilateral pleural effusions.  In
the appropriate clinical setting, superimposed pneumonia would
be difficult to exclude.

Brief Hospital Course:
84 y/o F with dementia and osteoporosis who presented with
tibial-fibula fracture s/p unwittnessed mechanical fall. Now she
is s/p ORIF ([**2170-7-14**]) with hospital course complicated by
hypotension, tachycardia and acute hypoxemia.

# Tibula-Fibula Fracture: S/p unwitnessed fall at her nursing
home. She initially presented to ortho clinic where she was
found to have a fracture. She was sent to the ED and
subsequently taken to the OR and underwent a successful
procedure, the details of which can be seen in the operative
note. During her ICU stay her leg was positioned in a splint/ace
bandage. Once she was transferred to the medicine floor, she
underwent placement of a short leg cast. Her pain was controlled
with tylenol and oxycodone. Per recommendations from orhto, she
should not bear weight on her right lower extremity until she is
evaluated by ortho clinic and the cast is removed next week.
Additionally she should continue to take lovenox unil [**6-27**]
for DVT prophylaxis.

# Hypoxemia: In the PACU, she was noted to be hypoxic to the 80s
and have systolic blood pressures in the 90s. Following the
procedure she was brought to the TSICU for further management.
The etiology of her hypoxia appeared to be multifactorial. She
was treated with supplemental oxygen via nasal cannula, pain
control, and antipsychotics for agitation. During her ICU stay
she was found to be volume overloaded, likely secondary to IVF
given during surgery. She was diuresed with lasix, and her
oxygen requirement decreased. She was also maintained on her
nebulizer treatments and inhalers. Additionally, she underwent
CTA chest for evlauation of possible PE. There was no evidence
of PE, but she was found to have tracheomalacia of uncertain
chronicity. Upon arrival to the floor she continued to have need
for supplemental oxygen. She spiked a fever to 101.6F, and was
pancultured. CXR at this time was suggestive of
pneumonia/pneumonitis. She was started on broad antibiotic
coverage for presumed aspiration PNA and HCAP. Her hypoxemia
improved and she was weaned off of supplemental oxygen. She was
discharged on flagyl and bactrim for a total course of 10 days
to end on [**8-1**].

# Encephalopathy (Metabolic): While in the ICU she developed
acute agitation and delerium, which was most likely
multifactorial, with contributions from underlying dementia,
pain, and ICU delerium. Additonally, she developed hypernatremia
while in the ICU, which could have contributed to her
confusional state. The geriatrics service was consulted, and
recommended adjustments to her medications which improved her
agitation. She received standing plus PRN haloperidol with good
effect, along with acetaminophen and oxycodone for pain control.
She had close monitoring of her QTc, with frequent EKG
monitoring. Upon transfer to the floor she was noted to have
some cogwheeling so her haldol was replaced with seroquel with
good effect. At discharge, patient was confused but calm and
redirectable. Of note, at her baseline she is severely demented,
and is oriented only to her name.

# Hypernatremia: In the setting of poor PO intake while in the
ICU, she developed hypernatremia. Based on an assumed weight of
65kg, her free water deficit was approximately 1.7L. We treated
her hypernatremia with gentle hydration with D5W and encouraging
PO intake. Her sodium normalized with these interventions.

# Hypotension: In the PACU she was noted to have SBP in the
90's. She was sent to the ICU for this, and her blood pressure
was monitored closely. Her hypotension resolved. Upon transfer
to the floor she was normotensive, and remained so for the
duration of her hospitali
