Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 13256**]
Chief Complaint:
Hematemesis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Therapeutic Paracentesis [**11-15**] and [**11-26**]
EGD with variceal banding [**11-19**]


History of Present Illness:
35 yo M with Hx of ongoing ETOH abuse, and episodes of Alcoholic
hepatitis leading to ETOH cirrhosis (c/b ascites, portal
gastropathy) originally presented w/ jaundice and abdominal
distension [**11-15**] to ET service, w/ a discriminant fct of 35.8 on
admission, w/ an episode of 100cc hematemesis on the floor
transferred to ICU for further care and EGD.
.
At home patient continues to consume [**1-1**] glasses of
vodka/whiskey daily.  He was experiencing symptoms of withdrawal
upon attempting to stop ETOH consumption.  In [**Name (NI) **], pt was
tachycardic, otherwise VSS.  On admission t bili was 10s and
rose to 12s, INR rising from 1.8 to 2.1.  He had a RUQ US that
showed cirrhosis, ascites, hepatofugal flow, no biliary
dilatation. CXR showed low lung volumes and left lower lobe
opacity treated w/ levoquine.  He was pan-cultured, para
negative for SBP.  He was started on prednisone then switched to
pentoxyphilline.  He was complaining of abdominal discomfort
thought to be due to his reducible umbilical hernia.
.
On day of transfer pt had a sudden episode of hematemesis.  He
denies nausea, but was experiencing abdominal pain.  Of note he
had an EGD in [**2186**], that showed portal gastropathy and 3mm polyp
at the fundus, but no varics.  His VS were notable for
tachycardia w/ HR in the 90s.  MICU team consulted for
hematemsis.
.
Currently, pt feels lightheaded and endorses abdominal pain.
.
Review of sytems:  As above.

[**11-15**] RUQ U/S:
IMPRESSION:
1. Cirrhosis with increased volume of abdominal ascites.
2. Very limited assessment of the hepatic vasculature. Flow
within the main
portal vein appears sluggish and likely reversed with
hepatofugal flow.
Intrahepatic portal vein and hepatic veins not reliably assessed
in this
study.
3. No intra- or extra-hepatic biliary dilatation
.
[**11-16**] CXR:
FINDINGS: As compared to the previous examination, there is a
newly appeared
left lower lobe opacity with several air bronchograms, better
seen on the
lateral than on the frontal image. In the appropriate clinical
setting, the
opacity could be suggestive of pneumonia. There is no evidence
of
accompanying pleural effusion. Borderline size of the cardiac
silhouette
without evidence of pulmonary edema. Overall low lung volumes.

Brief Hospital Course:
35 yo M with hx of ETOH cirrhosis c/b ascites, p/w abdominal
discomfort and jaundice, elevated t bili, started on
pentoxyfylline transferred to MICU for hematemesis. Bleeding
varices were successfully banded and alcoholic hepatitis was
improving on steroids.
.
#. Hematemesis: On [**11-19**], pt had 100 cc's of hematemesis. Hct
dropped to 31 on admission to 24. He was transfused 1U PRBC, 2U
FFP and had an EGD, which showed grade 2 varices; 3 bleeding
varices in the distal esophagus were banded. The patient was
maintained on an octreotide gtt and received ceftriaxone
prophylactically for GI bleed. Pantoprazole drip was initially
started and was changed to [**Hospital1 **] on ICU day #2. Serial Hct showed
stabilization.On the floor the patient tolerated solids well and
was started on Nadolol 20mg daily which he tolerated well (HR in
70's). He recieved 5 days of octreotide and 7 days of
antibacterial prophylaxis. He was discharged on 2 weeks of
Sucralfate suspension and Omeprazole 40mg daily.

#. Decompensated ETOH cirrhosis: Patient was initially admitted
to th
