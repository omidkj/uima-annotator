Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5129**]
Chief Complaint:
dyspnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 74 yo female with pmhx IPF, pulmonary HTN, COPD,
atrial fibrillation here with increasing O2 requirement (on 2L
NC at home) and dyspnea. Over the past two weeks, patient has
had a gradually increasing oxygen requirement (3L-->6L) and
increasing dyspnea. She has been sleeping on the couch because
it is more comfortable and she has been too sob to make it to
her bedroom. Today, she was too sob to make it to the bathroom.
Of note, she was recently diagnosed with atrial fibrillation and
started on diltiazem and coumadin. Since this diagnosis and
starting the meds she has felt worse. Of note, INR in ED was
21.8. She missed INR check friday and was supposed to get one
today. Easy bruising is one complaint, but no HA, dizziness,
hematochezia, melena. Patient denies fever,chills, sputum
production or wheezing. She sleeps with 1 pillow and denies PND,
orthopnea. She has noticed some lower extremity edema over the
last couple of weeks.
.
In ED, vitals were T 98, HR 115, BP 156/80. R 22, O2 sat 82% RA.

Patient given 500 mg azithromycin, 125 mg IV methylprednisilone,
albuterol and atrovent nebulizers. Attempts were made to wean
patient off 100% NRB but she would desat to the 70s on 50% face
mask.
.
In the unit, initial vs were: T afebrile, P 105, BP 138/65, R
34, O2 sat 100% 100% NRB but quickly desatted to 84% on 50% face
mask. She reported feeling comfortable with no complaints
currently.

Brief Hospital Course:
Pt is a 74 yo female with pmhx IPF, pulm htn, COPD here with
increasing oxygen requirement.
.
#. Hypoxia:  She was hypoxic requiring 100% facemask to maintain
O2 Sats in the low 90%s on admission.  She had multiple
potential reasons for hypoxia including underlying  IPF, COPD,
pulm HTN.  Given these underlying problems, small changes in the
lungs can make a large difference in her status.  Most likely
reason for the acute worsening was the atrial fibrillation with
RVR causing pulmonary congestion due to tachycardia and poor
forward flow.  Consistent with a volume-related etiology, she
had elevated JVP, pulm edema on cxr and trace pedal edema.  BNP
was also elevated to [**Numeric Identifier 7923**]. There was no evidence of COPD
exacerbation or pneumonia.  Thus, steroids were discontinued
after the one dose in the ED.  Levoquin was continued  for 3
days in the icu (plan for 5 day course on the floor).    Her
volume overload was treated with IV lasix, and she responded to
10-20mg with good urine output and improvement in O2 Sats, such
that facemask was weaned from 100% to 50%.  TTE was obtained
from her cardiologist and showed moderate MR, moderate TR, EF50%
(report in chart).  Lasix was held on day of discharge secondary
to hypernatremia and mild orthostasis and will need to be
restarted at the discretion of her cardiologist at the [**2156-5-3**]
appointment.
.
#. Elevated INR: Confirmed on repeat check.  She was given 5 mg
PO vitamin K x 2, and INR fell to within therapeutic range on
[**4-29**]. Coumadin was restarted at slightly less than half her
previous dose and she will require close monitoring of the INR
until it stabilizes. Goal INR = 2.0 - 3.0.
.
#. Afib: Given inadequate outpatient control with diltiazem,
this was changed to metoprolol which was uptitrated with good
effect.  She remains on telemetry which should be continued
initially at the rehab hospital to evaluate her heart rate with
activity.
.
#. Anemia: Hct near baseline.  B12/folate normal.
.
#. Hypothyroidism: TSH was checked given new afib and was
normal.  Levothyroxine was continued.
.
#. HTN: Linisopril was held so that metoprolol could be
uptitrated for rate control.
.
#. Depression: cont sertraline
.
#. Positive UA: She was asymptomatic. Levofloxacin was continued
initially pending cultures (to cover for possible PNA as well as
possible UTI).   Culture showed mixed bacterial [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] the
levofloxacin was continued. She should have a repeat cath UA and
culture in [**12-19**] days after discharge to the rehabilitation
hospital.

Discharge Disposition:
Extended Care

Facility:
[**Hospital1 8742**] [**Location (un) 686**] (LTAC)

Discharge Diagnosis:
Primary Diagnosis:
Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate
Pulmonary Edema

Secondary Diagnosis:
Supratherapeutic INR


Discharge Condition:
Stable, improved respiratory status on baseline 2L home O2
requirement.  Atrial fibrillation stable and rate controlled.


Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to the general medicine service because of
your shortness of breath and increasing oxygen requirment.  On
admission you had evidence of pulmonary edema, which is fluid in
you lungs that was secondary to your previous diagnosis of
atrial fibrillation.  You were treated with a diuretic to get
rid of excess fluid to return to your base line oxygen
requirement.

On admission your INR was supratherapeutic so your home dose of
Coumadin was stopped.  We restarted you on 2mg once a day when
you INR returned to therapeutic range.
