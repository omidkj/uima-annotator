HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 67-year-old woman
who was transferred from the MICU after a rigid bronchoscopy
and stent placement in her left main stem bronchus on
[**2138-12-16**] for a near total occlusion due to
adenocarcinoma.  The patient has a history of paroxysmal
atrial fibrillation since [**2136-11-30**].  She first
noticed dyspnea when walking in the spring of [**2137**], more
rapidly progressive since [**2138-5-31**].

Over the past several weeks, she has had multiple admissions
to [**Hospital 1562**] Hospital for recurrent atrial fibrillation with
rapid ventricular response; she was started on digoxin,
Diltiazem, and flecainide.  During her latest admission at
[**Last Name (LF) 1562**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] abnormal V/Q scan prompted a CT scan, which
revealed a soft tissue mass compressing the left main stem
bronchus.  She received bronchoscopy on [**2138-12-13**]
which revealed the mass occluding 90% of the bronchus.
Cytology was consistent with adenocarcinoma.

The patient was subsequently transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for rigid
bronchoscopy and stent placement.

On the night of admission, the patient had an increased
oxygen requirement, requiring a nonrebreather.  Chest x-ray
and CT were concerning for postobstructive pneumonia, right
upper lobe bronchus occlusion, lymphangitic spread of the
cancer.  She was transferred to the MICU on [**2138-12-15**].  A Cardiology consult recommended Amiodarone and
long-term warfarin for the atrial fibrillation with
discontinuation of the flecainide.  The patient was started
on clindamycin and levofloxacin for possible postobstructive
pneumonia.  A bronchoscopy with stent placement was performed
on [**2138-12-16**] without complications.

The patient noted increased easier breathing since, without
pain.  She continues to be in and out of atrial
fibrillation/flutter.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Atrial fibrillation.
2.  Nonsmall cell cancer, see above.
3.  History of positive PPD with negative AFB on
bronchoscopy.
4.  History of thyroid surgery.

MEDICATIONS ON TRANSFER:
1.  Metoprolol 25 mg p.o. t.i.d.
2.  Amiodarone 400 mg p.o. b.i.d.
3.  Warfarin 2.5 mg q.h.s.
4.  Fluticasone 440 b.i.d.
5.  Salmeterol two puffs b.i.d.
6.  Atrovent two puffs q.i.d.
7.  Albuterol p.r.n.
8.  Levofloxacin 500 q.d., day number three of 14.
9.  Clindamycin 300 q. six, day number three of 14.
10. Tylenol p.r.n.
11. Heparin 5,000 subcutaneously q. 12.
12. Protonix 40 mg q.d.
13. Levothyroxine 75 micrograms q.d.
14. Brimonidine ophthalmic solution.

ALLERGIES:  The patient is allergic to shrimp.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Thirty pack year history of smoking, quit 15
years ago.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Mother with breast cancer, father with [**Name2 (NI) 499**]
cancer.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Vital signs:  Temperature
maximum 97.9, heart rate 73, blood pressure 112/50,
respirations 23, oxygen saturation 89% on 4 liters nasal
cannula.  HEENT: The pupils were 3 mm to light, reactive.
Sclerae anicteric.  The oral mucosa was moist.  No lesions.
Neck:  Without cervical or supraclavicular lymphadenopathy.
Lungs:  Crackles one-half the way up bilaterally in the right
lung field, left lung clear to auscultation.  Heart:  Regular
rate and rhythm, normal S1, S2, no murmurs.  Abdomen:  Soft,
nontender, nondistended, with decreased bowel sounds.
Extremities:  Trace pretibial edema.  Neurologic:  Alert,
mentating well, no gross focal deficits.

LABORATORY DATA:  White blood count 17.3, hematocrit 34.8,
platelets 459,000.  Sodium 134, potassium 4.3, chloride 98,
bicarbonate 25, BUN 19, creatinine 0.7, glucose 103, calcium
8.5, phosphate 3.9, magnesium 2.0.

Bronchial washings:  1+ PMNs, 1+ gram-positive cocci in
pairs.

X-ray post stent revealed significant re-expansion of the
left lung, resolution of consolidation and infiltrates in the
left lower lobe, lingula with patchy infiltrates in the right
lung.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was transferred from the MICU
and continued on her medications for pneumonia and atrial
fibrillation.  On [**2138-12-19**], the patient underwent an
atrial flutter ablation procedure.  Telemetry monitoring
after this procedure revealed intermittent periods of sinus
rhythm with atrial fibrillation.

On [**2138-12-21**], the patient dropped her oxygen
saturation to 83 to 85% on 6 liters nasal cannula and was
placed on a nonrebreather mask.  On further consultation with
the Electrophysiology Service, they recommended continuing
her Amiodarone at a dose of 400 mg t.i.d.

The patient and her husband expressed a desire to be
transferred back to [**Hospital 1562**] Hospital for further treatment
for her lung cancer.  However, the patient was not felt to be
a good candidate for transfer due to her persistent
hypoxemia.

On [**2138-12-23**], the patient underwent a repeat
bronchoscopy which revealed tumor tissue in the left main
stem bronchus just proximal to the proximal end of the stent.
She underwent debulking of the tumor and replacement of the
stent in a prolonged and difficult procedure.

On the morning of [**2138-12-24**], the patient developed
acute respiratory decompensation with a PA02 of 43 on a face
mask.  She reverted to atrial fibrillation with a rapid
ventricular response.  Throughout this time, the patient was
conscious and mentating well and she reiterated her desire
not to be intubated or to receive positive pressure
ventilation.  She understood that she would most likely go
into respiratory fatigue and failure in her current status
without these interventions.

The patient was subsequently placed on a morphine drip for
comfort.  The Palliative Care Service was consulted and per
their recommendations, nonessential medications were
discontinued, Amiodarone was continued for increasing the
chance of sinus rhythm to maximize comfort, and a scopolamine
patch was started in addition to the morphine drip.

The patient died on the morning of [**2138-12-28**].
