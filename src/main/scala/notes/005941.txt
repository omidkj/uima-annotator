Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2736**]
Chief Complaint:
shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
88 F history of severe aortic stenosis (valve area 0.7 in [**2120**]),
dHF (takes lasix 40 PO daily at home), dementia, CKD, COPD
(baseline 88-91% on RA, uses O2 off and on at home) who presents
with dyspnea on exertion at nursing home x 2 days. Per nursing
home, pt has been SOB with exertion x 2 days, requiring O2 most
of the day whereas previously she was on O2 only at night. They
also note she has been feeling more weak lately. She was given
extra lasix 20mg PO and nebs at nursing home but continued to
have SOB. Had CXR at [**Location (un) 169**] showing no CHF, no
infiltrate.

Today, pt continued to have some shortness of breath (unchanged
from yesterday) requiring same amount of O2. Decision was made
to send her to the ED.

Per nursing home, patient's baseline weight: 181 Ib and is now
187 Ib which has been increasing.

In the ED, initial vitals were 99 73 170/80 18 100% on non
rebreather. Pt was then placed on BIPAP and pt looked clinically
more comfortable.

Labs and imaging significant for BNP 32,000, trop 0.03. CXR
showed pulmonary edema.

Patient given albuterol neb, ipratropium neb, solumedrol 125mg,
azithro 500mg for possible COPD. Also given SL nitro x1, lasix
80mg IV (put out 150 cc UO) and nitro gtt (3.8ml/hr, and BP
120s/90s).

Access: two 18 g IVs

Vitals on transfer: afebrile, HR 63, RR 28, 138/68, 100% on
BIPAP.

On arrival to the CCU, pt is comfortable, on BIPAP. After
removing bipap, she was found to sat 96% on RA. She states she
is confused as to why she is in the hospital and is frusterated
that she is here.

I spoke to daughter on phone who says her mother has poor
baseline status, she needs help with all ADLs, she has SOB with
minimal exertion (turning in bed, standing, etc...) and uses
oxygen on and off at home.

I called nursing home who states that she has been more fatigued
the last 2 days, requiring O2 most of the day (as opposed to off
and on) and for these reasons they brought her to the ED. They
also note her weight is up to 187 Ib from prior 181 Ib.

Brief Hospital Course:
88 F with dementia who lives in a nursing home also with history
of COPD (on oxygen at home), severe aortic stenosis (valve area
0.7 in [**2120**]), chronic diastolic heart failure who presented with
tachypnea, CXR showing mild pulmonary edema, BNP 32,000
consistent with acute on chronic diastolic heart failure.

ACUTE ISSUES
# PUMP/Acute on chronic diastolic heart failure: CXR with
pulmonary edema, 2+ pedal edema and BNP 32,000. Acute diastolic
heart failure episode likely secondary to progressive aortic
stenosis. Admission weight was 187 Ib, and her baseline weight
is 181 Ib. She was initialy given lasix 80mg IV, nitro gtt and
BIPAP. She was weaned off nitro gtt and BIPAP and diuresed.
Reason for her decompensated heart failure may most likely be
due to worsening aortic stenosis because her valve area has gone
down since prior imaging (it was .7 in [**2120**] and now is .4). It
is also psosible patientn has been eating salty foods however
she lives in a nursing home where her diet is usually
controlled. Per her daughter she looked like she was back to her
baseline the following day after diuresis and her pedal edema
went down and she was comfortably breathing on nasal canula.  We
increased the dose of lasix that she will be taking at home from
40 mg daily to 80 mg.

#Severe Aortic Stenosis: Echo here showed ([**2122-8-31**]): The left
atrium is mildly elongated. No atrial septal defect is seen by
2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity
size and regional/global systolic funct
