Brief Hospital Course:
He was admitted to the Trauma service and was transferred to the
Trauma ICU. On [**4-20**] he was fiberoptically intubated secondary to
worsening narrowing of airway felt secondary to the C2 hematoma.
On [**4-21**] he was noted with increasing sputum production, CXR
concerning for retrocardiac opacity and ? early infiltrate of
the RLL, and episode of hypoxia. Started on Levaquin/Zosyn after
mini bronch.

Neurosurgery was consulted for the spine injuries and he was
taken to the operating room on [**4-23**] for fusion of his fractures.
On [**4-24**] he was taken to the operating room for a tracheostomy
and PEG by trauma and ORIF of left hand, with wound VAC applied
done by Plastics. Postoperatively he remained in the Trauma ICU.

Interventional Radiology was consulted for guided placement of
Dobbhoff tube for enteral access for which patient self removed.
A bedside nasogastric tube was placed and he was found to have
free air on CXR and was brought to OR emergently for exploratory
laparotomy; 2 perforations found in stomach.

His blood pressures were intermittently elevated initially
requiring Labetalol drip while in the ICU. He is currently on
oral Lopressor and Norvasc with adequate blood pressure control.

On [**5-1**] he was weaned from ventilator and was tolerating Trach
collar. Once hemodynamically stable he was transferred to the
regular nursing unit. He was quite delirious upon transfer from
the ICU and was started on an antipsychotic to manage the
intermittent agitation. Trazodone was also added to help
regulate his sleep-wake cycle. His mental status improved
dramatically and he is currently awake, alert and oriented.

On [**5-5**] he sustained a fall and was re-scanned. No new injuries
were identified. On the following day he was noted with elevated
WBC and fevers; his cervical spine incision on exam was noted to
be erythematous. A CT scan was done to assess for collection and
one was identified. It was felt by Neurosurgery that this was
CSF fluid and was to be expected with this type of surgery. It
was deemed that this collection did not warrant drainage; rather
continue to watch patient clinically for any other changes
suggestive of infectious process.

He was taken back to the operating room on [**5-12**] by Plastics for
radial forearm flap and left thigh skin graft. The drain was
pulled on POD 1 by Plastics. He will follow up as an outpatient
on [**2111-5-19**] in [**Hospital 3595**] clinic.

His tracheosotmy was removed on [**5-13**]; his respiratory stauts and
oxygen saturations have remained stable since removal.

An incidental finding upon admission on CT imaging noted a left
thyroid nodule that will require a non-urgent ultrasound. He
should follow up with his PCP for this.

He was evaluated by Physical therapy and continued to progress
throughout his stay. He is being recommended for rehab after his
acute hospitalization.
