History of Present Illness:
88 yo F w/ mild dementia at baseline, RA, HTN, anemia, CRI, last
[**Hospital1 18**] admission ([**Date range (1) 11130**]) for AMS empirically treated for HAP
and meningitis with vanc, cefepime, ampicillin, acylcovir x14
days, hospitalization c/b NMS [**2-25**] haldol she received in ED on
that presentation, who presents with dyspnea. At baseline she is
alert, conversant, uses an electric wheelchair. She has no
baseline dementia and is primarily independent in ADS.
.
Per nursing home records, patient awoke short of breath and not
feeling well. VS initially notable for O2 Sat 50%, increased to
to 72% on 4L nasal cannuala. She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] ED.
In the ED, initial VS 97.3 103 117/72 32 90% 8L NRB. She was
intubated for hypoxia. She denied chest pain, cough, sputum, and
fevers in the ED. Exam notable for dyspnea, and was guaic
negative. CXR w/o effusion, consolidation, or pneumothorax. She
had a CTA that showed bilateral segmental and subsegmental
pulmonary emboli w/ small LLL peripheral wedged opacity, which
could represent pulmonary infarct, and evidence of R heart
strain. Labs notable for Trop 0.12, Cr 1.4, BNP 154, WBC 14.4,
Hgb 10.7, INR 1.1. On the [**Hospital1 **], her ABG was 7.28, 53, 326. She
received ASA 600mg, Albuterol/Ipratropium nebs, started on
Heparin gtt, and Fent/Midaz for sedation. She was planned to go
to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], but her SBP briefly dropped into the 80s. There was
consideration of lysis, so she was changed to a West bed.
However, with decreasing of her sedation, her SBP came up into
the low 100s. She also received 4 L NS. She never received
pressors or a central line. Family has not been contact[**Name (NI) **].
[**Name2 (NI) 5442**] settings prior to transfer: AC 500/18, PEEP 5, 100% FiO2.

CXR [**11-25**]:
No definite evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process.

CTA Chest [**2183-11-25**] - 1. Occlusive and nonocclusive lobar,
segmental and subsegmental bilateral pulmonary emboli involving
bilateral upper and lower lobes, with significant clot burden
and possible right heart strain.  2. Left lower lobe small
peripheral opacity likely represents a pulmonary infarct.  3.
Stable right apical pulmonary scarring with calcifications,
likely prior granulomatous disease.

Bilaterl Lower Extremity U/S [**2183-11-27**] - 1. Occlusive DVT in the
right superficial femoral and popliteal vein, but not involving
the common femoral vein. 2. No left lower extremity DVT.


Brief Hospital Course:
88 year-old woman presents with bilateral pulmonary emboli with
evidence of right heart strain.

# Pulmonary emboli: Patient markedly hypoxic with evidence of R
heart strain on CTA  secondary to multiple pulmonary emboli.
Briefly hypotensive in the ED.  On arrival to the ICU, she was
hemodynamically stable with SBP >100. Pt was treated with
heparin gtt and her FiO2 was quickly weaned to 40%.   Given
absence of hemodynamic instability and stable oxygenation, lysis
was not performed.   TTE with bubble study was done and showed
patent foramen ovale.  Lower extremity ultrasound showed a
persistent right-sided DVT.  Patient was transferred to the
floor, started on warfarin and continued on heparin until INR >
2.0  Patient was weaned from oxygen and was chest pain free by
the time of discharge.  INR will need to be checked q48 hours
after discharge until stable warfarin dose determined.  Warfarin
needs to be continued for at least 3 months, at which time
decision can be made by primary care physician regarding
risks/benefits of continuing anticoagulation in Mrs. [**Known lastname 805**].

# Rheumatoid arthritis:  On 10 mg prednisone at home. Likely has
some adrenal insufficiency related to that. Given borderline
hypotension and chronic prednisone use, pt was given stress dose
steroids on presentation to the ICU. She was tapered back to
maintenance dose of prednisone (10 mg daily) prior to discharge.

# Urinary Tract Infection: Patient had a foley catheter in place
during admission which was removed but she was noted to have a
positive UA.  Pt was started on empiric Cipro 500 mg daily for a
five day course and Urine Cx was pending at the time of
discharge.  She will need a follow up CBC [**12-4**] to confirm
resolution of mild leukocytosis.  Final Urine Cx revealed mixed
flora.
