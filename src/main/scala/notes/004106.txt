Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 290**]
Chief Complaint:
Rapid Afib, Pulmonary Embolus, Dyspnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Expired


History of Present Illness:
This is a 73 yo F with a past medical history significant for
NSCLC s/p resection, in remission for 5 years, and marked COPD,
who presents to the ED after experiencing progressive dyspnea
over the last several weeks, requiring oxygen therapy around the
clock rather than just with exertion. In the ED she was found to
be in afib (new for this patient) with RVR to 170's. She was
sent for CTA and was found to have a small subsegmental PE and
was started on a heparin gtt. She was given a dose of
levofloxacin for ?infectious process given leukocytosis on CBC
to 26 and she was initiated on a dilt gtt after two doses of IV
dilt did not affect her HR that much.

She also notes swelling in her legs bilaterally and her left
arm, as well as a new mass in the left side of her neck which
per the patient grew in entirety over the last two weeks. Of
note, she also had knowledge of a breast mass, which had not yet
been worked up. Last mammogram seems to be in [**2161**]. Per the
patient's PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**6-13**], "She has adamantly refused all screening
and followup testing at this time.  We discussed follow up chest
x-rays and CT scans for example and also mammograms, but she
refuses that.  She refuses colon cancer screening.  At this
point, she feels that she would not accept or take any further
medications or any further
therapies for any further diseases."

She is admitted to the MICU for further evaluation of her afib
with RVR and dyspnea.

Currently in the MICU, the patient is hemodynamically stable
with a HR in the 140's-150's. She is breathless on supplemental
O2. She denies fevers/chills, n/v or nightsweats. She admits to
some weight loss, and although does not entertain palpitations,
she felt something was wrong and attributed it to her chronic
anxiety. She denies calf tenderness, chest or abdominal pain.
She is refusing blood draws and foley catheter.

EKG: Afib with RVR to 170's.

CXR:
1.  Hazy opacity in the right lung base may represent a layering
pleural effusion, although pneumonia cannot be excluded; a
lateral view is recommended.
2.  Stable emphysematous changes and volume loss on the left
related to left upper lobectomy.

CTA Chest:
1.  Right lower lobe subsegmental pulmonary embolism.  No
evidence of compression of the SVC.
2.  Moderate-to-severe emphysema with interstitial septal
thickening consistent with underlying CHF.  Small left greater
than right pleural effusions, with atelectasis in the right
lower lobe.
3.  Status post left upper lobectomy with stable left volume
loss and post-radiation changes.
4.  Interval development of hypodense mass likely arising from
the left lobe of the thyroid.  Two left upper quadrant soft
tissue masses.  Multiple mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes as
described above.  Soft tissue nodule in the left breast and
subcentimeter likely lymph node in the presternal soft tissues.
Given the patient's history of lung cancer, these findings are
suspicious for malignancy.


Brief Hospital Course:
73 yo F with a past medical history of NSCLC status-post
chemo-radiation and right upper lobectomy admitted with
progressive dyspnea in the setting of multiple new masses, new
atrial fibrillation with RVR, and subsegmental PE.

# Dyspnea: Etiologies for the patient's dyspnea include atrial
fibrillation with RVR with decreased forward flow, progression
of COPD, interstitial lung disease secondary to radiation
therapy, metastasis and infection. Although she had a
leukocytosis, and possible effusion at the right base, she was
afebrile during her inpatient stay. She does have a very small
subsegmental PE, which could have also contributed to dyspnea.
Was rate controlled with a esmolol drip.  Patient then became
suddenly hypoxic with short duration asystole the afternoon of
[**2169-1-31**], thought to be secondary to possible mucous plugging.
Daughter was [**Name (NI) 653**] concerning the event and her mother's
poor prognosis.  At that time, she requested she be CMO.  All
medications were stopped and she was given morphine IV for
comfort.  She expired at 8:15pm on [**2169-1-31**] due to
cardiopulmonary arrest.

# Afib with RVR: Unclear if her known small subsegmental PE
would actually cause the patient's Afib with RVR. Other possible
causes could be dehydration in the setting of poor PO
intake/infection.  Also rapidly growing mass contiguous with the
thyroid could be causing a relative thyroiditis, or be producing
thyroid hormone itself.  TSH was check and was low normal.  Rate
was controlled with an esmolol drip until the events immediately
preceding her death.

# Pulmonary Embolus: Known small subsegmental PE.  Thus, she was
maintained on a heparin gtt.  ED confirmed with Oncology that it
was okay to start heparin gtt without head imaging as long as
initiated without a bolus.  PE thought to be likely [**3-11**] to
tumor.  Heparin gtt was discontinued once patient was made CMO
on [**2169-1-31**].

# Neck Mass: Concerning for malignancy. Patient had a breast
mass noted on a mammogram from [**2163**] and has since refused follow
up screening. Concerned that this could represent a breast
primary with metastases to her thyroid and mediastinal nodes.
Unclear what left upper quadrant masses are at this time. Other
possibility is recrudescence of NSCLC, but this is unlikely
although she continued to smoke until this year.  With poor oral
intake, fatigue and weight loss, malignancy was high on the
differential.  Associated hoarseness could be secondary to
recurrent laryngeal nerve compression.  Heme-onc was consulted
and recommended obtaining tissue for a diagnosis.  General
surgery was consulted but determined she was too unstable during
her stay for tissue biopsy.  Patient expired without clear
diagnosis and family declined autopsy.

# Anxiety/Depression:  While inpatient was continued on
antidepressants and Ativan PRN.

# COPD: This ongoing issue likely contributed to her overall
respiratory distress while inpatient.  She was treated with
Atrovent and Albuterol was used only minimally secondary to
concern for tachycardia.
