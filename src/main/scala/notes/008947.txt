to her baseline after last admission.  She continued to have
copious secretions and leakage around her G tube.  At nursing
home she spiked to 104 this morning; she was also found to be
tachypneic and hypoxic to the 80s on room air.  EMS was called
and patient was brought to ED for further care.
.
In the ED, initial vitals were: 110/78, RR 20s, HR 120, Temp
102, and 97% on BiPap.  Labs were significant for: WBC of 17.4,
lactate of 4.0, sodium of 150, BNP of 4510, and creatinine of
2.2 (up from baseline of Ms. [**Known lastname **] was treated broadly for
respiratory and urinary source with vanc and zosyn.  Received 2
L of NS.  Patient was also started on BiPap for respiratory
distress.

Studies
[**2170-1-29**] CXR: The cardiac, mediastinal, and hilar contours appear
unchanged.  Shaggy mitral annular calcifications are again
present. The lungs remain clear. There is no evidence for
pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  IMPRESSION: No evidence of
acute disease.
.
[**2171-1-31**] CT CHEST w/o CONTRAST:
IMPRESSION:
1. Multifocal pneumonia, most severe at right lung base,
consistent with
aspiration. Endobronchial occlusion superior segmental bronchus
left lower
lobe probably retained secretions or aspirate.
2. Moderate cardiomegaly. Probable pulmonary arterial
hypertension, and
possible mitral regurgitation. No pulmonary edema.
3. Nonobstructing papillary right renal calculus.
.
[**2171-2-2**]
FINDINGS: Two bedside supine views of the abdomen after
injection of contrast via the indwelling gastric tube
demonstrates the gastric tube to now terminate within the
stomach. No contrast leak is identified. The bowel gas pattern
is normal. No ileus, obstruction, or free air. The visualized
osseous structures are unremarkable.
IMPRESSION: GJ tube conversion to G-tube. No contrast leak
identified.

Brief Hospital Course:
Primary Reason for Hospitalization:
This is an 87-year-old woman with a pmhx. of CVA, HTN, and DM2
with recent admission for AMS and UTI presents with fever and
hypoxia, found to have aspiration pna.
.
Active issues:
# Aspiration pna: Presented with fever/leukocytosis, hypoxia,
found to have multifocal aspiration pna on chest CT.  She was
treated with IV Zosyn and should complete a 10 day course (to
end [**2-8**]).  Her WBC trended down and her fever and hypoxia
resolved (on room air on day of discharge).  Recommend chest PT
2-3x daily due to poor clearance of airway secretions.
.
# Hypernatremia: Improved with free water, likely [**2-28**]
dehydration.  Recommend 500cc free water flushes Q6H via G-tube.

.
# G-tube leakage: Pt's G-tube was noted to be leaking bile,
causing skin breakdown around insertion site.  G-tube study
showed tube had advanced to small bowel.  GI service was
consulted and the tube was re-positioned, repeat G-tube study
confirmed placement in stomach.
.
# Goals of care: The palliative care service and inpatient
social worker were consulted due to confusion surrounding her
code status on admission.  Per family meeting on [**2-1**], family
would like to maintain DNR/DNI code status.  They would like to
continue tube feeds through G-tube and offer PO food if pt
expresses interest (but request no scheduled PO feedings by
[**Hospital1 1501**]).
.
# Hyperglycemia: Pt had blood glucose levels monitored QACHS
with ISS, FS ranged 200s.  Would recommend continued monitoring
of blood glucose levels with regular ISS if consistent with
family's wishes regarding her goals of care.
.
# [**Last Name (un) **]: Resolved with IV fluids, c/w pre-renal etiology.
Creatinine 0.7 on discharge.
.
Chronic issues:
# Depression: Stable on home duloxetine.
.
# HLD: Stable. Recommend discontinue statin due to transaminitis
(chronic since [**2166**], may be [**2-28**] statin).
.
# H/o CVA: Stable. She was continued on her home ASA.
.
Transitional issues:
-She should continue IV Zosyn to complete 10 day course (to end
[**2-8**]).
-Recommend d/c statin due to transaminitis.
-Recommend 500cc free water flushes via G-tube Q6H
-Recommend regular chest PT to help clear airway secretions.
-Per family meeting on [**2-1**], she is DNR/DNI.
