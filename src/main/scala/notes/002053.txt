HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 27 year old female
with a history of asthma whose last asthma flareup was in
[**2186-1-30**].  Prior to admission she woke up around
3:00 a.m. with worsening shortness of breath.  She used her
inhaler/nebulizer and was able to go back to sleep.  When she
woke up she got short of breath and progressively worsened
over the morning.  She took prednisone 40 mg and began using
her inhaler from every four hours to every one hour.  She
then came to the emergency department.  She denied fever,
chills.  She did have a cough with rare sputum production.
She denied nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, dysuria.  She
claimed that this was very similar to her previous episodes,
but does not know of any symptoms or triggers for this
attack.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vitals on exam 98.8, rate 117, blood
pressure 143/84, respiratory rate 20, 93% in room air, 98%
post nebs.  Pertinent physical findings included diffuse
bilateral expiratory wheezing, good air movement.  She was
tachycardiac, no murmurs.  Skin was without rashes.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Asthma with 64 PICU stays, multiple
MICU admissions, no previous intubations.  She has chronic
sinusitis with nasal polyps, status post seven polypectomies.
She has a history of hypokalemia.

b.i.d., Nasonex, Zoloft 100 q.d., Ortho Tri-Cyclen.

ALLERGIES:  Include penicillin, sulfa, metabisulfites
(preservatives in medications such as epinephrine), latex.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  After arriving in the emergency department
on [**8-13**], she proceeded to have worsening shortness of breath.
She received q.four hour nebs, IV steroids in the emergency
department and then was transferred to the floor.  After a
few hours her requirements increased to q.one hour nebs and
closer observation, thus she was transferred to the MICU
later that evening.  A Z-Pak was added to the regimen.  In
the MICU the frequent nebulizer treatments and steroids were
continued, but she received elective intubation on [**8-13**] for
better ventilation due to increased difficulty breathing
regardless of the continued nebulizer treatments.  She was
extubated on [**8-14**] without difficulty and was stable to
transfer to the floor the following day, but they decided to
watch her for a few more days while on greater than or equal
to q.three hour nebs.

On [**8-16**] she was started on IV aminophylline which was
switched to p.o. theophylline on [**8-17**].  She was transferred
to the general medicine floor on [**8-18**].  Patient was wheezing
upon auscultation, but patient stated she was feeling better.
Patient states her peak flow personal best is approximately
400, on the 17th she was 285, the following day she was in
the 250s to 260s.  On the floor she continued with q.four to
six hour nebulizer treatments as needed.  On the 20th patient
was started on her home regimen with nebulizers p.r.n.  On
the 20th patient ambulated with physical therapy.  O2 sats
upon ambulation were 92% to 93%.  Her peak flow was found to
be 350.  On physical exam she has good air movement and
decreased wheezing bilaterally.  Thus, it was determined it
was safe to be discharged home that afternoon.
