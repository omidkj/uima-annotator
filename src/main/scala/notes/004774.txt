PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:  Laboratories on
admission revealed a complete blood count with a white blood
cell count of 9.9, her hematocrit was 30.4, and her platelets
were 167,000.  Her prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin
time, and INR were normal.  Her sodium was 136, potassium was
4.4, chloride was 101, bicarbonate was 24, blood urea
nitrogen was 92, creatinine was 2.3, and her blood glucose
was 146.  Her creatine kinase was 217.  Her CK/MB was 8.  Her
troponin was 0.35.  Her calcium was 9.3, her phosphorous was
4.8, and her magnesium was 1.8.

PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  A chest x-ray showed
cardiomegaly with severe pulmonary edema.

CONCISE SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  On [**2148-9-7**] (at
1410), the patient developed flash pulmonary edema with
hypertension and a blood gas of 7.2/40/63.  The patient was
intubated and given 180 mg of Lasix.  A chest x-ray at that
time showed cardiomegaly with blunting of the right
costophrenic angle with peripheral vascular redistribution
and prominence of the pulmonary vasculature.  Her troponin
level was 4.2.  Her creatine kinase was 219.  Her CK/MB was
9.3.  At this time, the patient was begun on intravenous
heparin and 2-beta 3-A inhibitor.  She was then transferred
to [**Hospital1 69**] for further
evaluation.

The patient underwent a cardiac catheterization which
demonstrated severe 3-vessel disease.  The left main coronary
artery was 90% occluded, the left anterior descending artery
was totally occluded after the first diagonal, the left
circumflex was totally occluded, and the right coronary
artery was not injected because it was known to be occluded.
The grafts were visualized with a patent left internal
mammary artery to the first diagonal, the saphenous obtuse
marginal was patent with a distal limb atretic with
retrograde filling of the left circumflex.  The saphenous
vein graft to the posterior descending artery was patent with
diffuse distal branch disease and 90% stenosis of the
posterolateral branch.  The saphenous vein graft to the left
anterior descending artery was patent throughout.  The
resting hemodynamics demonstrated moderately elevated
left-sided and right-sided filling pressures with a left
ventricular end-diastolic pressure of 15, a pulmonary wedge
pressure of 15, and the right atrial mean pressure was 10,
and the central aortic pressures were normal.

At the time of the patient's admission and cardiac
evaluation, Vascular Surgery was consulted regarding the
patient's left leg cellulitis.  Ultimate recommendations were
that she would require an angiography to determine the extent
of her peripheral vascular disease.  This was delayed until
the patient was clinically stable.

Her post myocardial infarction course was complicated by
recurrent pulmonary edema and congestive heart failure
requiring afterload reduction and diuretics for improvement,
diminished renal output secondary to hypoperfusion and
microvascular disease, with a peak creatinine of 2.4, and
difficulty with swallowing which was evaluated by a Speech
and Swallow evaluation.  This showed mild pharyngeal
dysphagia.  Recommendations were a regular diet with thick
liquids and the patient to be sitting up when eating.

The patient eventually had her renal function improve and to
baseline.  On [**9-24**], after Mucomyst and intravenous
hydration protocol, an arteriogram which demonstrated
abdominal aorta with moderate diffuse disease.  The right
renal artery had a dual supply with a 90% stenosis at the
osseus, and the left renal artery had an 80% stenosis with
ulceration.  The left lower extremity showed the common
femoral artery with mild disease.  The graft was patent, but
the distal anastomosis showed 99% stenosis with
reconstitution of the popliteal with distal occlusion at the
AK.  The BK was reconstituted by the collaterals.  The tibial
peroneal trunk the main vessel runoff was the anterior tibial
to the foot.

Because of the patient's renal failure, she did require a
hemodialysis catheter placement and dialysis was begun for
volume control.

After review of the arteriograms, the patient was transferred
to the Vascular Service on [**10-1**] after undergoing a
left AK popliteal to anterior tibial bypass with reversed
saphenous vein.  She was transferred to the regular nursing
floor on postoperative day three.

On postoperative day six, the patient had an episode of
increased shortness of breath with a negative
electrocardiogram and cardiac enzymes.  A chest x-ray showed
congestive heart failure.  She required adjustment in her
diuresis.  Social Service followed the patient for support.
She required multiple adjustments in her antihypertensive
medications and beta blockers to maintain a systolic blood
pressure in the 120s to 150s.
