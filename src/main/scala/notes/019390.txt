History of Present Illness:
Pt is a 19yo M with no significant [**Hospital **] transferred from OSH with
pneumonia and respiratory distress.  Pt presented to his PCP's
office with a 2 day h/o nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain.  He
had no associated diarrhea, fever. It was thought to [**Last Name (un) **] viral
process and pt was prescribed Motrin and an antiemetic.  Later
that night he developed a cough productive of yellow sputum and
SOB.  He presented to the ED, and was found to be febrile to 102
with coughing and tachypnea.  His ABG was 7.47/29/72 and WBC was
43,000 (33% bands).  He received azithromycin and ceftriaxone.
He was admitted to [**Hospital1 1474**] on [**2120-8-8**] for pneumonia, ARF, and
dehydration. O2 was 85% on RA, 97-100% on 100% face mask.
Ceftazidime and vancomycin were added to his antibiotic regimen.
 He was transferred to the ICU on the morning of [**2120-8-9**] for
hypoxia and tachypnea.  In the ICU he was maintained on 100% FM.

.
Upon arrival to the [**Name (NI) 153**], pt was satting 94-97% on 80% FM but
was markedly tachypneic.  He was started on BiPAP to decrease
his work of breathing, but continued to have RR in the 30s-40s.
The decision was made to intubate him urgently before he tired
out.  Upon intubation, he was found to have thick [**Name (NI) **]-colored
endobronchial secretions.  He was put on AC with high PEEP but
had O2 saturations in the 60s-70s.  He was then ambu-bagged and
suctioned, then sedated, paralyzed, and put back on the vent
with resulting increase in O2 sats to the 80s.  He gradually
increased his sats to 99-100% on AC 600/28/1.0 with PEEP 15.

OSH imaging (reports):
CXR ([**2120-8-8**]): diffuse bilateral pulmonary infiltrates with b/l
pleural effusions, infiltrates slightly nodular.
CXR ([**2120-8-9**]): extensive b/l pulmonary infiltrates with perhaps a
little improvement overall as seen yesterday.
KUB ([**2120-8-9**]): unremarkable abdomen.
CT chest ([**2120-8-9**]): diffuse nodular pattern, small bilateral
pleural effusions


Brief Hospital Course:
#ID/Pulm:  Mr. [**Known lastname 63138**] was admitted acute respiratory
distress, no known cardiac problems, and bilateral pulmonary
infiltrates on CXR.  The patient was intubated promptly in the
ICU and remained on ventilator for 10 days, with excellent O2
sats upon extubation.
The precipitant was thought to be most likely an infectious
process as he presented to the OSH with fever, cough, and
bandemia.  The differential included bacterial pneumonia, such
as Strep. pneumo, which would be the most likely cause as it is
community-acquired and not uncommonly has negative cultures.
Other entities considered included atypicals, and less likely
viral and diffuse fungal pneumonia.  An extensive workup was
performed, including testing for atypical serologies (including
Coxiella, Tularemia, Hantavirus) which were pending at time of
discharge.  No serologies returned positive (including
Ehrilichia, HIV testing, and Legionella antigen).  All C diff
and urine cultures were negative.  Blood cultures from the OSH
were negative.  While in house, two blood cultures grew positive
for coagulase-negative Staph species; this was treated with a 7
day course of vancomycin with no further growth of blood
cultures.
Serum IgG was checked toward the end of admission to ensure that
the negative serologies were not a consequence of
hypogammaglobulinemia/immunodeficiency; SPEP returned within
normal limits.
He was treated with several kinds of antibiotics to cover
bacterial, atypical, and viral pneumonias.  He did develop
increased nasal discharge after several days on intubation and a
CT of the sinuses showed diffuse opacification; he was
discharged on a 7 day course of levofloxacin for sinusitis.
Procedures performed included a bronchoscopy (BAL culture was
negative for PCP and AFB).  Thoracenteses were performed on both
the right and left sides over his ICU stay, revealing a
exudative effusion, eosinophils, and negative cultures.  Several
studies were still pending at the time of discharge.  The
patient's primary care physician [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was updated on the
patient's course and will follow these studies as an outpatient.
.
#GI: The patient had elevations in amylase and lipase over his
hospital course with essentially normal LFTs.  These were
associated with no abdominal pain or tenderness but mild
diarrhea and some transient abdominal distention in the ICU.
Workup was entirely negative with no ascites on abdominal,
negative OSH CT abdomen/pelvis, negative KUB for obstruction,
negative stool studies were negative, including C. diff.  He
developed recurrent leukocytosis in the setting of being
hospitalized and on several antibiotics, so C. diff colitis is
on the differential.
.
#Endocrine: There was a question of adrenal insufficiency during
the patient's ICU stay manifested by a baseline cortisol of 0.8.
 The patient responded adequately to stim testing, and serum
ACTH returned within normal limits.  Endocrine consultation was
obtained; it was felt that the patient was euadrenal and steroid
supplementation was held.

#eosinophilia:  Eosinophils were found in the peripheral smear
(30%) and also in the patient's pleural effusion.  DDx includes
drug reaction (although likely too high) versus parasite
infection.  Stronglyoides serology was sent and pending at
discharge.  After the patient's course of antibiotics for
pneumonia, his Augmentin was changed to levofloxacin out of
concern for a possible eosinophilic reaction to clavulonate.

#anemia: The patient was found to be anemic over the course of
his admission in the setting of being +7 liters in fluid
balance.  No baseline was available for comparison; however
ongoing losses were deemed to be unlikely as the Hct was stably
in the low 30s throughout with no clear trend.
