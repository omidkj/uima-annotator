Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2071**]
Chief Complaint:
Congestive Heart Failure, Non-ST elevation Myocardial Infection,
Urinary Tract Infection

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
84 year old female per record has a history of colon cancer
recent diagnosis of pneumonia presenting from an outside
hospital with congestive heart failure, NSTEMI, and urinary
tract infection. Patient is confused and unable to answer
questions, history obtained from chart from [**Hospital3 **] and
from husband. She was recently admitted to [**Hospital3 **]
[**2165-10-25**] for lethargy and PNA, had been hospitalized prior to
that for R colectomy for colon Ca c/b cholecystitis s/p
cholecystecomty and also had G tube placement. PNA treated with
oral abx and dc'ed to rehab with anticipation that G tube would
be removed in near future.
.
She was sent to [**Hospital3 **] again on [**2165-11-2**] from rehab for
shortnss of breath, nasal congestion and desat to 70s, improved
to 93% with O2 by NC. the onset was 2 days prior to
presentation. The patient characterizes increased shortness of
breath at rest. SOB is exacerbated by activity; relieved with
rest. At the outside hospital, her room air saturation was noted
to be in the 70s and she was tachypneic, placed on O2 by NC.
.
In regard to associated symptoms, the patient denies chest pain,
cough, headache or change in vision, neck stiffness, abdominal
pain, focal numbness tingling or weakness, dysuria or urinary
frequency although patient appears to be altered and knows she
is in a hospital but does not know why, thinks she lives at home
with her husband and is not sure of the year.
.
In the ED, noted to have physical exam with stigmata of CHF
including symmetric lower extremity edema, crackles in the bases
bilaterally, +JVD. Give 40 mg IV lasix at outside hospital ED
and received vanc and zosyn for evidence of UTI on UA. Troponin
noted to be elevated at 0.15, Cr 1.9, Hct 33.3. She was given
heparin bolus and gtt for concern for NSTEMI as well with EKG
showing a flutter at 85 and TWI in lateral leads, no prior. BNP
ordered in ED and is pending. Also received duonebs with some
improvmeent in dyspnea. Initial ED VS 96.1 86 113/71 24 98% 2l
at [**Hospital1 18**].
.
Currently, patient denies any complaints although she is
breathing very quickly and appears uncomfortable. Husband notes
that she has been increasingly forgetful over the last few
months but has been confused in that she is not sure entirely of
what day it is, where she is at all times. She also has
occasinally been very agitated and angry while at rehab. After
first operation in [**9-22**] for colon cancer, she started getting
more confused. Per husband, mental status at baseline today. He
thought she had been improving, denied any complaints in the
last couple of days, but while he was vistiting her today she
suddenly started breathing very hard. No fevers, but has had
cough and congestion for the last about 7 days, was recently
admitted for PNA and had been on a course of keflex. Lower
extremity edema has been presented since [**9-22**] and has not
worsened. Husband denies any other symptoms.

CXR [**2165-11-2**]:
UPRIGHT AP VIEW OF THE CHEST: The heart size is mildly enlarged.
There is
mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema with perihilar haziness and
vascular
indistinctness. Additionally, small-to-moderate sized layering
bilateral
pleural effusions are present, greater on the left than on the
right. Dense opacification in the retrocardiac region may
reflect compressive atelectasis. Infection, however, is not
excluded. Diffuse calcification of the aorta is present. There
is no pneumothorax. Right PICC tip terminates within the mid
SVC. No acute osseous abnormalities are seen.
IMPRESSION:
Mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema. Small-to-moderate sized
bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right.
Retrocardiac opacity may reflect compressive atelectasis though
infection cannot be excluded.
.
EEG [**2165-11-6**]:
FINDINGS:
CONTINUOUS EEG: The initial part of this recording (eight
minutes) is
performed on the Natus EEG system. This shows continuous
bilateral
frontally maximal high voltage sharp and slow wave discharges at
2 Hz.
The discharges are of higher amplitude over the right
hemisphere. EEG
is then continued on the Apropos system at 1 a.m. The patient
had
received intravenous lorazepam in the interim. The recording
shows a
[**6-18**] Hz posterior dominant rhythm with diffuse frontally maximal
semi-rhythmic delta activity. There are frequent high voltage
bilateral
sharp and slow wave discharges, sometimes in brief periodic runs
at
0.5-1 Hz. EEG is disconnected between 2 and 3 a.m. At 4:30 a.m.,
there
is recurrence of the 2 Hz high voltage sharp and slow wave
discharge
pattern in bursts lasting three to five minutes. This then
resolves
until 5 a.m. when the high voltage sharp and slow wave
discharges recur
at 1.5 Hz lasting until 6:50 a.m., resolving for several minutes
and
then continuing until the end of the study at 7 a.m.
SPIKE DETECTION PROGRAMS: There are 1,009 automated spike
detections
predominantly for the high voltage spike and slow wave
discharges
described above, as well as EMG and electrode artifact.
SEIZURE DETECTION PROGRAMS: There are 11 automated seizure
detections
predominantly for electrode and movement artifact. There are
several
prolonged electrographic seizures, as described above.
PUSHBUTTON ACTIVATIONS: There are no pushbutton activations.
SLEEP: The patient progresses from wakefulness to stage II, then
slow
wave slee
