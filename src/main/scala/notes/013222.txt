Service:  NEUROLOGY

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:   This is a 73-year-old
Russian-speaking man with a history of hypertension and
diabetes.  He had an old stroke as well, and presents with
several days of increasing weakness in his right side.  At
baseline, he is able to ambulate despite an old left-sided
hemiparesis.  He was unable to give a history because he is
Russian-speaking, but his wife clearly says that his
hemiparesis has worsened.  Also he has been shaking in the
left arm and leg for at least the day prior to admission as
well.  Three weeks ago, he fell and hit his head.  Apparently
the CT scan at the time was normal, according to the family.
No chest pain, shortness of breath or fever or diarrhea.
When he was seen in the Emergency Department, he was clearly
shaking his left arm rhythmically, consistent with an
appearance of a focal motor seizure.  He was given 1.5 mg of
Ativan and started on an oral Dilantin load, for which the
patient stopped seizing. However, after 20 minutes of rest,
seizures started again. At that point, intravenous Dilantin
was loaded an Ativan was given again, with a halting of the
seizure activity.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:   He has a history of a
gastrointestinal bleed from question of [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]-[**Doctor Last Name **] tear,
he has Type II diabetes controlled with oral agents, he is
hypertensive, runs in the 150s with left ventricular
hypertrophy, has chronic renal insufficiency.  Cardiac-wise,
he has normal left ventricular function with hypertrophy.

MEDICATIONS:   He is on Diltiazem, enalapril, aspirin, Colace
and Glyburide.

FAMILY HISTORY:   Unknown.

SOCIAL HISTORY:   He worked as a tailor.  It is not known
whether he has ever smoked, and it is unknown whether he
drank.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:   Vitals were 180/80, pulse 92,
temperature afebrile, oxygen saturation 96% on room air,
respiratory rate 18.  His head was normocephalic, atraumatic.
Cardiac-wise, regular rate and rhythm, a systolic ejection
murmur.  Lungs clear bilaterally.  Abdomen:  Bowel sounds
soft, nontender, nondistended.  Extremities no edema.

NEUROLOGIC EXAMINATION:  Mental status:  Sleepy, oriented to
person.  Speech is appropriate, fluent, attentive.  Following
directions and wiggling fingers and toes.  He is able to
cross the midline.  Cranial nerves II through XII:  Pupil on
left was 4 mm and reactive, right 3 mm and reactive.
Funduscopic examination was normal.  Extraocular motions were
full.  Visual fields were full.  No nystagmus.  V1 through V3
was intact to light touch.  Face was symmetric.  Masseter
muscle strength intact.  Hearing was grossly intact.  Palate
was symmetric.  Tongue was midline.

Motor examination:  No tremor.  Increased tone on the left
side.  Rhythmic tonic/clonic movements in his left arm.  He
was able to move his right arm and leg purposefully, and
appeared to be full strength.  Left leg was flaccid and had
difficulty moving it.  Left leg was moving spontaneously.  I
think movements were decreased compared to his right side,
however.

Sensory examination:  He appeared to be decreased to light
touch on his left side.  Reflexes 1+ in his upper extremities
on the right side, no reflexes on the left side.  Zero at his
patellars both left and right, 1+ ankles bilaterally, and
bilateral upgoing toes.  Coordination was intact to
finger-to-nose on the right side.  Rapid alternating motion
and heel-to-shin unable to test on the left side.  Gait was
unable to test.

He had a CT of his head in the Emergency Room showing a
chronic left subdural hematoma, a posterior frontal infarct
which is subacute, old white matter lesion extending into the
corona radiata.  Urinalysis was pending.

HOSPITAL COURSE:   The patient was admitted to the Neurology
service and overnight on [**11-7**] to [**11-8**], continued to have
twitching in his left side.  Was given Ativan, but the
twitching continued.  Remained stable by vital signs.  An MRI
was attempted, but the patient was combative at that time, so
was not done.  The head CT from [**11-7**] was read as increasing
hypodensity along the superior frontal parietal border,
possibly representing an evolving infarction.  Interval
development of a low attenuation left subdural hematoma.  The
hypodensity of this region is suggestive of a chronic
subdural hemorrhage.  In addition, there were multiple old
lacunar infarcts and diffuse bilateral periventricular white
matter hypodensities, consistent with chronic lacunar and
microvascular infarcts.

Because of his continuing seizures, the patient was
transferred to the Neurology Intensive Care Unit where,
because of his seizures, he was increased on his Dilantin as
well as started on phenobarbital.  On [**11-9**], the patient
had a drop in his systolic blood pressure at 11 A.M., first
to 70 and then to 50.  He received a bolus of lactated
Ringer's and was placed in Trendelenburg with an increase in
his blood pressure subsequently to between 140 and 160.  At
that time, he started shaking again, however, neurologically
remained stable.  Had periods of apnea without any falls in
his oxygen saturation, and became increasingly lethargic and
difficult to arouse, even as his shaking in the left arm
decreased.

On [**11-9**], the patient had an MRI of his head showing an acute
right-sided watershed infarct in the parietal occipital
region and extensive periventricular white matter changes and
basal ganglion chronic lacunar infarcts.  Again the chronic
subdural hematoma in the left frontal temporal parietal
region with effacement of the left hemispheric sulci without
midline shift was seen.

On [**11-9**], the patient had an MRA of his neck vessels, which
showed a moderate to high-grade stenosis, approximately 1.5
cm distal to the right internal carotid artery, with possible
associated ulcer, however, the examination was slightly
limited by motion, so the patient had a carotid ultrasound to
follow that up on [**2194-11-10**].  The carotid ultrasound showed
significant plaque with an 80 to 99% right carotid stenosis
and a 40 to 59% left carotid stenosis.  The patient remained
in the Neurology Intensive Care Unit with lethargy, able to
open his eyes to name, but not following commands in Russian
or in English.  Did withdraw all extremities to pain, and
continued on his anti-epileptics, with therapeutic levels in
both his Dilantin and phenobarbital.

Follow up head CT was obtained because the patient remained
lethargic, which showed no significant change since his CT on
admission.  The patient required a nitroglycerin drip to
maintain blood pressure at goal.  The patient remained
extremely lethargic, opening eyes to voice and not moving
extremities to noxious stimuli by [**11-12**].  Chest x-ray
was done, showing left lower lobe consolidation and also
increase in markings consistent with mild congestive heart
failure.  The patient was started on Levaquin for pneumonia.
Urinalysis was sent, which was positive for urinary tract
infection with an organism that was enterococcus.  Ampicillin
was started for his urinary tract infection.

On [**11-14**], the patient got another MRI to evaluate him for
decreased mental status because he continued to be lethargic,
and it was thought that it could be extension of his prior
stroke.  Again no interval change in the previously-described
right parietal temporal occipital infarcts or the left
chronic subdural hematoma.

The patient was transferred to the floor on [**2194-11-14**], with
continued decreased mental status and lethargy.  He had an
electroencephalogram on [**11-8**] to evaluate for seizures, which
was read as abnormal electroencephalogram due to the slow and
disorganized background, bursts of generalized slowing, and
additional focal mixed frequency slowing over the right
hemisphere.  The first two abnormalities signified a
widespread encephalopathic condition, the second both
cortical and subcortical structures, toxic metabolic causes
are the most common.  The additional focal right hemisphere
slowing indicates a subcortical dysfu
