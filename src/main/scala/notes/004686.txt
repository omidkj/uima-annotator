STUDIES:
[**2200-12-13**] CXR:
Patchy opacity noted at the left lung base obscuring the left
costophrenic angle. Please correlate with subsequent CT chest

[**2200-12-13**] CT chest:
1. No pulmonary embolism.
2. Atelectasis at the base of the left lower lobe.
3. Emphysema.

[**2200-12-15**]
STUDY: AP abdominal radiograph and left lateral decubitus
abdominal
radiograph.

COMPARISON: None.

FINDINGS: Gas and stool is seen throughout the colon. There are
no dilated
loops of small bowel, nor are there any air-fluid levels. No
pneumoperitoneum
is seen. A left total hip arthroplasty is seen without evidence
of failure or
loosening. Opacity seen in the left lower lobe is concerning for
an
infiltrate.

IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of obstruction or perforation.
2. Left lower lobe infiltrate.

[**2200-12-17**]
UPRIGHT AP VIEW OF THE CHEST: Mild enlargement of the heart is
unchanged in
comparison to prior exam. There is an ill-defined new right
upper lobe
opacity, consistent with clinical suggestion of aspiration. The
previously
seen left lower lobe opacity has slightly increased in density
on the current
exam. The remaining areas of the lungs are clear. Hilar and
mediastinal
contours are relatively unchanged.

IMPRESSION: New right upper lobe opacity, and increased left
lower lobe
opacity compatible with clinical suggestion of aspiration with
concern for
pneumonia.

The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

[**2200-12-18**]
STUDY: Video oropharyngeal swallow studies; multiple
consistencies of barium were administered under fluoroscopic
observation in conjunction with the speech and swallow division.


FINDINGS: Barium passed freely without evidence of obstruction.
Penetration was noted with thin liquids and nectar. One episode
of silent aspiration was noted with thin liquids. For more
details, please see the speech and swallow division note in the
online medical record.

IMPRESSION: Penetration with thin liquids and nectar; one
episode of silent aspiration with thin liquids.

The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.



Brief Hospital Course:
59M with schizophrenia, COPD on chronic steroids, unspecified
HF, current smoker admitted from nursing home for COPD
exacerbation.

1. Acute Exacerbation of COPD: The patient's baseline oxygen
saturation in low 90s, likely secondary to known severe COPD. He
was admitted to the ICU given his presentation of hypoxia with
02 sat's in the 70s. There was originally a question of whether
he had a PNA given his LLL consolidation but only atelectasis
was seen on CTA. No PE was noted. He remained afebrile. He was
treated for a COPD flare with nebulizers, azithromycin, the
course now completed, and steroids with improvement. He was
transferred to the floor. He was noted to be choking up with
feeding.A video swallow study showed that he  had had some
silent aspiration. A subsequent CXR showed a RUQ infiltrate
indicating a pneumonia, which may have had some contribution
from aspiration. Given his poor dentition, and given that he
developed this aspiration during his hospitalization this was
treated as a HCAP. He was treated with vancomycin and zosyn with
effect. He will have a total antibiotic course of 8 days. He
will also undergo a two week steroid taper. He had already
received the pneumoccal vaccine and seasonal flu vaccine. The
H1N1 is still not available to inpatients at [**Hospital1 18**] thus this was
not given. He had needed supplemental oxygen during his
hospitalization, but was discharge on room air.

2. ? Aspiration:He was noted to have had some choking during
feeding. He had a bedside swallow evaluation which sh
