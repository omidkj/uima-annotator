Service:  CARDIOTHOR

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname 25752**] is a 69 year-old male
admitted to the Cardiac Service on [**2110-12-1**] for an
electrophysiology consult prior to elective coronary artery
bypass graft that was scheduled for [**2110-12-3**].  He had been
previously admitted to the [**Hospital1 188**] early [**Month (only) 1096**] and had a catheterization on [**2110-11-17**],
which showed 50 to 60% left main disease, normal left
anterior descending coronary artery, patent left circumflex
stent, subtotal AV groove, circumoral occlusion as well as
right coronary artery total occlusion, but filled by
collateral.  There is evidence of pulmonary hypertension.
His EF was measured at 50%.  He was seen by electrophysiology
at that time for cardioversion of his chronic atrial
fibrillation.  At that time he sustained a 35 beat run of
ventricular tachycardia during that cardioversion effort.
EPS done this a.m. on [**2110-12-2**] showed areas needing
cryotherapy for coronary artery bypass graft.  The patient
also went into a complete heart block with junctional escape
of 40 beats per minute with EPS and a partial ablation.  He
had temporary pacing wires placed and his being placed prior
to coronary artery bypass graft in the a.m.  He was stable at
presentation with no pain or symptoms.  He denied any chest
pain, shortness of breath, palpitations, groin pain.  No
headache, nausea or vomiting.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs were 60 ventricular paced,
141/66 with a mean arteriole pressure of 89, respiratory rate
16 with a room air saturation of 97%.  Oral temperature was
97.7 degrees Fahrenheit.  He was in no acute disease.  He was
in reverse Trendelenburg.  His mucous membranes are moist.
His extraocular movements intact.  His pupils were equal,
round and reactive to light and accommodation.  His trachea
was midline.  There was no evidence of carotid bruit.  His
neck was supple.  His lungs were clear to auscultation
bilaterally.  No wheezes, rhonchi or crackles.  Heart was
regular, brady.  there was no murmur.  There was no
ventricular heave.  Abdomen was soft, nontender, nondistended
with normoactive bowel sounds.  Extremities were notable for
no clubbing, cyanosis or edema or calf tenderness.  He had
palpable pulses distally.  Dorsalis pedis pulse and posterior
tibial pulse bilaterally.  Neurologically, he was alert and
oriented times three.  He was in good spirits.  He had a
nonfocal examination.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for coronary artery
disease.  He had an elective coronary artery bypass graft
scheduled for [**2110-12-3**] based on prior catheterization
[**2110-11-17**].  He has had a history of mild chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease, rheumatoid arthritis, congestive heart
failure now complete heart block, underlying atrial
fibrillation, atrial flutter, nonsustained ventricular
tachycardia.  Significant for hyperlipidemia as well as
benign prostatic hypertrophy.

ALLERGIES:  Penicillin.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Coumadin, which was stopped two
weeks prior to admission, Lopressor 25 mg po b.i.d., aspirin,
which was also discontinued on [**2110-11-28**], Proscar 5 mg po q
day, Hytrin 2 mg po q day, vitamin E 400 international units
q day, Zestril 5 mg q day, Amiodarone 200 mg po t.i.d.,
Lipitor 20 mg po q day.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is divorced.  He has three
children.  He is a social drinker.  He quit tobacco ten years
ago, but had greater then fifty year smoking history prior to
that.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Significant for father dying of congestive
heart failure at age 83.  His brother had a coronary artery
bypass graft times three in his fifties.

ADMISSION LABORATORIES:  Significant for white count of
11,00, hematocrit 41, platelet count 263,000.  His BUN and
creatinine were 20 and 1.1.  His coagulation panel was 12.7,
1.1 for his PT/INR respectively with a PTT of 26.

Based on the previously mentioned results, he was admitted to
the Cardiothoracic Service.  Cardiothoracic surgery was
notified with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  He was placed on strict bed rest.
He was in ventricular pacing mode.  He ultimately went to the
Operating Room on [**2110-12-3**] where he underwent a coronary
artery bypass graft times three including conduits from the
left internal mammary coronary artery to the left anterior
descending coronary artery, saphenous vein graft to obtuse
marginal one and also to obtuse marginal two.  He also
underwent left ventricular aneurysm ablation with
cryotherapy.  This procedure was done under general
endotracheal anesthesia with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] as well as Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 11442**].
His pericardium was left open.  He had a radial A line and
left J Swan-Ganz catheter.  He had two ventricular and two
atrial wires as well as two mediastinal and one left pleural
tube.  He had an endoscopic vein harvest that was performed
on the right thigh with a hybrid technique to the right calf
to take out his saphenous vein graft.  Additionally his
cardiopulmonary bypass time was 83 minutes.  His cross clamp
time was 71 minutes.  He tolerated the procedure well and was
brought out of the Operating Room in a V paced mode.

He was brought to the Cardiosurgical Recovery Unit where the
Electrophysiology Department discussed placing an ICD for
[**2110-12-4**].  They also recommended the Swan-Ganz catheter and
Foley be removed at that time prior to the ICD placement.
They recommended that the patient be NPO after midnight and
to check his white count for manual diff.  By postop day
number one the patient was hemodynamically stable.  He was AV
paced at 93.  Blood pressure was 113/56.  He was 94% on a
nasal cannula.  His hematocrit was 29 postoperatively with a
BUN and creatinine of 21 and 1.1.  His neo-synephrine was
being utilized for blood pressure support, which was weaned
off.  Ultimately the Electrophysiology Service brought him to
the catheterization laboratory where they attempted to and
did place an ICD implant in the left subclavian in the
clavipectoral lesion.  It was entered in the cephalic vein
and supraclavicular region was not utilized.  The left
subclavian vein was entered and [**Company 1543**] 5076 was placed
without difficulty.  He was then returned to the floor where
he continued to do well.  His heart rate was 60 and V paced
at this time.  Blood pressure 117/44.  Otherwise he was
working with physical therapy ambulating a level two.  His
pacer was set by the EP fellow to a mode of DDD from 60 to 20
and with mode switch on.

He underwent an attempted paced termination of his atrial
fibrillation flutter with burst atrial pacing.  However this
was unsuccessful.  He underwent a second attempt by EPS on
postop day number four that was additionally unsuccessful.
Therefore the Electrophysiology Service recommended that the
patient start Amiodarone, continue a 200 t.i.d. times two
weeks and then 400 q.d. times three weeks.  Coumadin should
again be restarted with a maintenance dose of approximately 5
mg q day.  Additionally Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] recommends that the
patient follow up with him on [**1-14**] in the [**Hospital 19721**] Clinic.
The patient can call to make an appointment.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  Keflex 500 mg po q.i.d. times twelve
days done for some scant sternal drainage that was noted in
the last 48 hours of his admission.  Percocet 5/325 one to
two tabs po q 4 to 6 prn.  Colace 100 mg po b.i.d., Lasix 20
mg po q.a.m. times seven days, K-Dur 20 milliequivalents po
q.a.m. times seven days, Coumadin 5 mg po q.h.s., Plavix 75
mg po q day, aspirin 81 mg po q day, Amiodarone 200 mg t.i.d.
times two weeks and then 400 mg po q day times three weeks,
Hytrin 2 mg q day, Protonix 40 mg po q.d., Lipitor 20 mg po
q.d., vitamin E 400 international units q day and iron
sulfate 325 mg po t.i.d. with meals.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Stable in a ventricular paced
rhythm, scant sternal drainage.  He was afebrile with a
temperature of 99.0.  78 with a DDD pacing mode, 132/79 blood
pressure.  98% on room air.  Sternum was stable.  No
