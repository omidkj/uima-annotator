History of Present Illness:
75yo man with hx of CAD s/p CABG [**2161**] (LIMA to LAD, SVG to PDA,
OM and Diagonal), PVD, HTN, hyperlipidemia who presents from OSH
with STEMI on POD#1 s/p left shoulder surgery. He tolerated
surgery well then was noted to be tachypneic and hypercarbic
last night while on dilaudid PCA. ABG 7.15/61/57 so went to ICU
for Bipap. Apparently improved then started vomitting at 5am.
EKG at 8am showed NSR, NA, Q in III and aVF, STE II and aVF,
<1mm STE V5-V6. TropI elevated to 90. He was sent here for cath.

.
In the cath lab, LIMA-LAD patent, OM and diag grafts closed, and
SVG-OM was diffusely diseased w tight distal lesion.
Thrombectomy performed on SVG-OM and dilatation with balloon
improved lumen and flow. The distal SVG-OM anastomosis was
stented with Vision x3 stents with initially normal flow. Flow
then noted to be decreased followed by drop in systemic BP and
increased STE inferiorly requiring increasing dopamine. IABP
placed for elevated LVEDP to 25 and hypotension. Lasix 40iv
given. Patient also with vomiting so anesthesia called for
urgent intubation for airway protection. Difficult to oxygenate
thereafter with O2 sat 88% which improved with increasing PEEP
and suction.
.
Upon transfer to ICU, patient stable on dopamine 15, IABP at
1:1, and intubated with AC 500/18 FiO2 100% and Peep 10. Sedate
so no ROS.

C. Cath [**2176-4-26**]
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1- Three vessel CAD and ostial total occlusion of the SVG-D2 and

SVG-RPDA.
2- Markedly elevated left-sided filling pressures
3- Successful PTCA and stenting of the SVG-OM1 with three
overlapping
BMS
4- Successful placement of IABP with good hemodynamic ersponse
.
TTE [**4-26**]
The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed
(LVEF= 40-45 %) with lateral hypokinesis. with depressed free
wall contractility. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is mild pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

.
TTE [**4-29**]
The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. Left
ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There
is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
hypokinesis of the basal inferior and basal half of the
anterolateral wall. The remaining segments contract normally
(LVEF = 45-50 %). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic
regurgitation. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with
trivial mitral regurgitation. The tricuspid valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. Significant pulmonic regurgitation is seen. There
is no pericardial effusion.

TTE [**5-1**]
Patient intubated, maneuvers with saline contrast were not
performed. No evidence of PFO with rest injection. If clinically
indicated, a TEE might be more sensitive to identify PFO.

CXR [**2176-5-6**]:
Frontal and lateral chest radiographs show bibasilar
consolidation
consistent with atelectasis, most pronounced at the retrocardiac
area. The
circular area of opacity described on the previous radiograph is
not apparent and in retrospect, was likely an area of resolving
atelectasis, though repeat frontal and lateral chest radiographs
when the patient is able to take a better breath is recommended
at a later date. Evidence of previous cardiac surgery is
redemonstrated. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable as is the
visualized osseous and soft tissue structures.


Brief Hospital Course:
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 75yo man with hx of CAD s/p CABG [**2161**] (LIMA
to LAD, SVG to PDA, OM and Diagonal), PVD, HTN, hyperlipidemia
admitted with STEMI

# Cardiogenic shock and STEMI: Patient underwent cath with 3 BMS
to distal SVG to OM CK peaked at 6000 indicating a massive
amount of ischemia. Given severity of MI cardiogenic shock is
most likely due to ischemia. Hemodynamics improved with IABP,
but hypotension persisted. Levophed and dopamine were required
initially but levophed was stopped on [**4-29**] and Dopamine on [**5-2**].
Pt IABP was weaned before dopapmine, and IABP was removed
without complications. Pt also had labile blood pressures and
was treated for adrenal insufficency of critical illness and
received hydrocortisone while in the ICU for one day, which was
stopped when blood pressures stabilized. TTE showed LVEF 45-50%,
and LV lateral wall function had improved. At time of discharge
patient was hemodynamically stable. Patient was continued on
ASA, Statin, ACE-I, Beta blocker and started on plavix.

# RHYTHM: Patient remained in normal sinus rhythm. His beta
blocker was held while he required IV pressors but was restarted
following removal of IABP and pressors being weaned off.

# Anemia/thrombocytopenia: Patient developed anemia and
thrombocytopenia while on IABP. Likely
