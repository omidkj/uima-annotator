Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7333**]
Chief Complaint:
pericardial effusion

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Pericardiocentesis with balloon pericardiotomy


History of Present Illness:
72 yo male patient of Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] with history of recently
diagnosed stage IV NSCLC followed by Onc at [**Hospital1 2025**], COPD, and Afib
admitted to CCU following pericardial drain and window. He was
recently admitted here from [**Date range (1) 20188**] for drainage of
pericardial effusion which was found to have malignant cells on
cytology along with high suspicion for lung CA on CT from [**Hospital1 2025**].
Since then, he has followed up at [**Hospital1 2025**] (where he was admitted
previously) for oncological treatment and chemo with his first
dose on [**10-18**] and next dose scheduled for [**11-8**]. Since chemo,
he has felt more fatigued, has had decreased appetite and nausea
but denies any new shortness of breath. During an office visit
with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] this past Monday, he was noted to have an ECG
with very low voltages concerning for re-accumulation. He was
arranged for outpatient pericardiocentesis with balloon
pericardiotomy and window.
.
In the cath lab, pericardiocentesis performed with 220cc (fluid
sent for culture) drained. He tolerated the procedure well
without any complications. On the floor he is comfortable with
what he calls tolerable pain in his chest.
.
On review of systems, s/he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. S/he denies recent fevers, chills or
rigors. S/he denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the
other review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain
other than that associated with his procedure, dyspnea on
exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema,
palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

PERICARDIOTOMY
COMMENTS:
1. Pericardiocentesis was performed with needle entry from the
subxiphoid position. Opening pericardial pressure was 5mmHg.
2. Pericardiotomy was performed using balloon.
3. Subsequent to 220mL of sanguinous fluid was drained from the
pericardium and confirmation of minimal residual pericardial
effusion a
pericardial drain was placed.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Mild pericardial tamponade status post balloon
pericardiotomy.
.
PRE PROCEDURE ECHO [**2153-10-24**]
There is a small to moderate sized pericardial effusion. The
effusion appears circumferential. The effusion is echo dense,
consistent with blood, inflammation or other cellular elements.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**10-5**]/201, the
pericardial effusion has increased in size.
.
POST-PROCEDURE ECHO [**2153-10-25**]
Limited views. There is a small pericardial effusio similar to
prior effusion seen after the pericardiocentesis [**2153-10-24**] which
appears loculated and not circumferential. No diastolic collapse
of RA as seen on echocardiogram prior to the pericardiocentesis
on [**2153-10-24**].
.
ECHO [**2153-10-26**]
There is no pericardial effusion. There is an anterior space
which most likely represents a prominent fat pad.

Brief Hospital Course:
72 yo male patient of Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] with history of recently
diagnosed Stage IV NSCLC s/p one cycle of chemo at [**Hospital1 2025**], COPD,
afib, dCHF admitted to CCU for monitoring s/p pericardial drain
and balloon pericardotomy.
.
#Malignant Pericardial Effusion: Mr [**Known lastname 105142**] [**Last Name (Titles) 1834**]
pericardial drainage with 220 cc immediate drainage and the
drain was left in place. He also [**Last Name (Titles) 1834**]  balloon
pericardiotomy. The the drain output was less than 80ccs and the
drain was pulled the next day. Post procedure echos showed
resolution of the effusion.
.
CHRONIC ISSUES:
#Stage IV NSCLC: Followed at [**Hospital1 2025**] and undergoing chemo.
.
#COPD: Stable. Continued Advair.
.
#Atrial fibrillation: Rate controlled with home diltiazem while
admitted. Not on warfarin for prior SDH. Continued aspirin.
.
#GERD: Continued home pepcid 20 mg daily
.
#HTN: Continued home diltiazem.
.
#Anxiety: Cont ativan [**Hospital1 **] PRN
.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
#Pericardial effusion: He should undergo repeat echo to ensure
the effusion has not recurred prior to follow up with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] in [**3-7**] weeks.
