Service:  CICU

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 81-year-old
male with a complex past medical history including diabetes
mellitus (complicated by retinopathy, neuropathy, and
nephropathy), single-vessel coronary artery disease (status
post percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty and
stenting of the left circumflex artery in [**2125-3-26**]), and
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (on home oxygen) who
was admitted to an outside hospital on [**12-1**] with the
complaint of acute onset of substernal chest pressure.

The patient presented to the outside hospital Emergency
Department with complaints of the acute onset of substernal
chest pressure radiating to the jaw, unresponsive to two
sublingual nitroglycerin.  The episode of chest pressure had
been preceded by several days of generalized weakness and
dizziness as well as progressive shortness of breath.

In the Emergency Department at the outside hospital, the
patient was found bradycardic to the 30s and hypotensive
(80s/50s).  The patient received intravenous fluids,
atropine, as well as dopamine while in the Emergency
Department.  The initial electrocardiogram demonstrated
junctional bradycardia without acute ST-T wave changes.  The
patient had a transthoracic echocardiogram which demonstrated
stable left ventricular ejection fraction of 40% without
evidence of pericardial effusion.

The patient was admitted to the Cardiothoracic Intensive Care
Unit for further evaluation.  On the first hospital day, the
dopamine was weaned off, and the patient's blood pressure
normalized.  The patient had a small troponin leak of 0.98
with negative creatine kinase enzymes and reportedly no
further changes on electrocardiogram.  During his
hospitalization, the patient was heparinized; however,
developed intermittent recurrence of chest pain.  The patient
was started on a 2B3A inhibitor, Plavix, as well as aspirin
and was then transferred to [**Hospital1 188**] for cardiac catheterization.

On the morning of transfer, the patient was found febrile
with a progressive productive cough and an increasing oxygen
requirement; with an oxygen saturation of 79% on 4 liters
nasal cannula.  The patient was placed on a 100%
nonrebreather mask with resultant carbon dioxide retention
and hypercarbic respiratory failure (arterial blood gas was
7.26/72/127) requiring intubation.  The patient was
transferred to [**Hospital1 69**] intubated
and sedated for cardiac catheterization.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
 1.  Type 2 diabetes mellitus (insulin-requiring);
complicated by retinopathy, neuropathy, and nephropathy.
 2.  Coronary artery disease (single-vessel); status post
left circumflex stent placement in [**2125-3-26**].
 3.  Peripheral vascular disease; status post stroke (no
deficits).  Status post right carotid endarterectomy and
status post bilateral femoral-popliteal bypasses.
 4.  Hypertension.
 5.  Hypercholesterolemia.
 6.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (on 3 liters nasal
cannula oxygen at home).
 7.  Chronic renal insufficiency.
 8.  Cardiomyopathy (with an ejection fraction of 35% to
40%).
 9.  Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
10.  Status post transurethral resection of prostate.

ALLERGIES:   No known drug allergies.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Physical examination
on admission revealed vital signs with a temperature of 99.1,
heart rate was 66, blood pressure was 128/47, oxygen
saturation was 100% (on 100% FIO2).  In general, the patient
was intubated; however, alert and responsive to verbal
stimuli.  Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat examination
revealed pupils were equally round and reactive to light and
accommodation.  Extraocular movements were intact
bilaterally.  Sclerae were anicteric.  Mucous membranes were
moist.  The oropharynx was clear.  Pulmonary examination
revealed coarse breath sounds throughout; otherwise clear to
auscultation.  Cardiovascular examination revealed a regular
rate with normal first heart sound and second heart sound.  A
2/6 systolic murmur at the apex.  Abdominal examination
revealed soft, somewhat distended, normal active bowel
sounds.  No masses were appreciated.  Extremity examination
revealed no edema.  Dopplerable dorsalis pedis pulses
bilaterally.  Femoral pulses were 1+ bilaterally.  Scars from
previous surgery were clean, dry, and intact.

PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:  Laboratories and
studies revealed complete blood count with a white blood cell
count of 10.3, hematocrit was 26.8, and platelets were 267.
Chemistry-7 revealed sodium was 138, potassium was 5.1,
chloride was 99, bicarbonate was 29, blood urea nitrogen was
30, creatinine was 1.4, and blood glucose was 137.

RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  The patient's initial chest x-ray
demonstrated bilateral alveolar opacities at the lung bases;
consistent with aspiration versus dependent congestive heart
failure.

An abdominal x-ray on admission demonstrated no dilated loops
of bowel and no free air; however, significant stool was seen
throughout the bowel.

MICROBIOLOGY DATA:  Microbiology data throughout the
hospitalization included blood cultures (no growth to day at
the time of this dictation), sputum culture (no growth),
urine culture (no growth).

HOSPITAL COURSE:  On arrival to [**Hospital1 188**], the patient went immediately to the cardiac
catheterization.

On cardiac catheterization, the patient was found with a
left-dominant system with moderate disease of the left
anterior descending artery ostium with a 40% tubular mid
stenosis.  The patient was also noted to have a serial 70% to
80% mid left circumflex occlusion with 30% mid segment
occlusion after the takeoff of the first obtuse marginal.

On right-heart catheterization, the patient was found to have
pulmonary hypertension with a right ventricular systolic
pressure of 57, with evaluated right-sided filling pressures,
with a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 21, and
pulmonary artery diastolic pressure of 23.  The patient had
well preserved cardiac output of 9.98 and a cardiac index of
4.49.

The remained of the hospital course by system as follows:

1.  CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM:  Status post cardiac
catheterization, the patient was transferred to the Cardiac
Intensive Care Unit, intubated and sedated, for further
monitoring and management.

During the patient's outside hospitalization, the patient was
noted to have 1-mm ST depressions in the lateral leads
associated with the recurrent episodes of chest pressure.
Status post cardiac catheterization, the patient's
electrocardiogram changes resolved with reperfusion.  There
was no evidence of cardiac enzyme leak.  The patient remained
in a normal sinus rhythm without evidence of ectopy on
telemetry.  The patient received 18 hours of 2B3A inhibitor
(Integrilin) and was started on anti-platelet agents
including aspirin and Plavix.  The patient remained
normotensive status post procedure without the need for
further pressor support.  Subsequently, the patient's beta
blocker and ACE inhibitor were reintroduced for rate and
blood pressure control.  The ACE inhibitor and beta blocker
were subsequently titrated over several days as the patient's
blood pressure and heart rate tolerated.

At the outside hospital, the patient was noted to have
moderate left ventricular systolic dysfunction with an
ejection fraction of 35% to 40%.  The patient required
intermittent diuresis during this hospitalization for a
congestive heart
