Pertinent Results:
Chest Xray [**2114-9-15**]
No acute pulmonary process
.
LLE LENI [**2114-9-15**]
No evidence of left lower extremity DVT. Popliteal vein appears
to compress normally in comparison to prior examination but exam
was limited in this region.
.
CTA Chest [**2114-9-15**]
No central or segmental pe. distal branches obscured due to
breathing. ?mild chf.
.
2D-ECHOCARDIOGRAM performed on [**2114-5-1**] demonstrated:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric
left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is
mildly dilated. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
normal (LVEF 60%; this value represents the estimated ejection
fraction following a normal left ventricular filling period).
There is no ventricular septal defect. The right ventricular
cavity is dilated. Right ventricular systolic function appears
depressed. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is
not present. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed)
of [**2113-12-14**], the ventricular rate is now well-controlled
and the left ventricular ejection fraction is increased.
.
ETT performed on [**2112-10-4**] demonstrated:
4.5 minutes of [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 4001**] protocol (3.5METs) and stopped for
fatigue. The ST segments are uninterpretable in the setting of
RBBB with diffuse ST-T wave abnormalities at baseline. The
rhythm was sinus with frequent AEA (isolated APDs) and frequent
VEA (isolated multifocal VPDs, ventricular couplets and
ventricular bigeminy). The hemodynamic response to exercise was
appropriate.


Brief Hospital Course:
This patient is a 74 y/o M with history of a fib,
cardiomyopathy, HTN, gerd, DVT (on lovenox), p/w SOB, LE edema
and in Afib with RVR.
.
1. AFib RVR: Patient has been noncompliant with his medications
for the last few days, secondary to "not feeling well." on
lovenox, on rate control, working with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] as
outpatient to control without starting amiodarone.
- Patient on Diltizem drip 20mg/hr. Start wean
- Load with PO dilt, 60 QID
- Metoprolol 100mg [**Hospital1 **] (on 200mg toprol as outpatient)
- monitor vital signs, consider cardioversion for instability
-> Pt admitted to CCU.  Rate control achieved with 200mg toprol
XL and verpamil 240mg and diltiazem weaned.  Patient discharged
on above regimen.  Lovenox continued at therapeutic doses for
anticoagulation for DVT and A. Fib.
.
2. CHF, diastolic acute on chronic: patient with significant LE
edema, has not taken diuretics for last 2 days, bibasilar
crackles, SOB, O2 requirement
- back on home dyazide
- 10mg Lasix IV
- goal out 1L today
-> Patient diuresed well with net ouf 750cc day 1 and net out on
day of discharge.  Symptomatically improved.  Home lasix dose
increased to 20mg PO.  Given 10meq PO Potassium as mildly
hypokalemic during hospital stay.
.
3. CAD: ? old infarct on EKG. No history of MI, stress
uninterpretable secondary to RBBB
- continue ASA, Statin, BBlocker, ACEI
- f/u with outpatient provider.
.
4. Dyspnea: likely secondary to a fib and CHF exacerbation. no
wheezes
- treat a fib with rate control
- diurese
-> Improved and 93% on RA on day of discharge.
-> CTA of chest showed no significant PE but ? RLL filling
defect.  Low suspicion for PE, patient anticoagulated in any
case and study not repeated.  LE USD negative for DVT with
compression of popliteal vein (also limited study).  CT Scan of
chest demonstrated lymphadenopathy noted on prior scans and
stable RUL nodule.  Recommend repeat CT in [**5-8**] months for
lymphadenopathy, and outpatient CT scan or PET scan for
lymphadenopathy.  Discussed with PCP who is aware and agrees
with plan.
.
5. depression - stable
- continue paxil
.
6. GERD, Hiatal Hernia - stable
- Ranitidine decreased for Cr 1.4 to daily dosing.
- continue pantoprazole
.
Code: presumed full
.
Dispo: Tranfer to home directly from CCU.  F/u as below.
