History of Present Illness:
83 y.o. Italian speaking male being followed for a 3.5 cm RUL
cavitary nodule, suspcious for TB or cavitary tumor, returns for
eval. He preferred observation rather than biopsy at his last
visit. Currently, the pt reports only occas dry cough and some
shortness of breath after climbing two flights of stairs, which
does not require him to sit down. RUL transbronchial biopsy done
in [**2102-7-31**] was negative for malignancy. Currently the
patient has had a repeat CT scan which demonstrated FDG avidity
in the region of the lung nodule and some uptake in T11. He does
come today with an X-ray report of the thoracic and lumbar spine
which demonstrated no abnormality in that region.

IMAGING & STUDIES:
------------------
[**2103-3-21**] CXR:
There is right chest tube in place. Opacities in the right
perihilar region and right mid lung are postoperative findings.
Cardiomegaly is stable. There is no large pneumothorax or
pleural effusions. There is right subcutaneous emphysema.
.
[**2103-3-24**] CT CHEST NON-CONTRAST:
IMPRESSION:
1. Status post right upper lobectomy, with a small air-fluid
level seen in the resection bed. No evidence of hemorrhage. A
small loculated pneumothorax and small simple effusion in the
right basal pleural space.
2. Partial aeration of the superior segment of the right lower
lobe, with
near complete collapse of the right middle and lower lobes.
Large amount of secretions obstructing the right main and
bronchus intermedius.
3. Large amount of right chest wall emphysema relates to the
recent
procedure.
.
[**2103-3-30**] CT CHEST NON-CONTRAST:
IMPRESSION:
1. Enlarged large right hydrothorax at the right upper lobectomy
bed.
2. Interval complete collapse of the right middle and lower
lobes, with
slightly increased rightward mediastinal shift.
3. Unchanged right lower 4.8 x 4.3 cm extrapulmonary gas-fluid
collection.
4. Large amount of secretions within the bronchus intermedius
and distal
branches.
5. Clear left lung.
.
[**2103-3-30**] BRONCHIAL WASHINGS: PLEURAL FLUID.
GRAM STAIN (Final [**2103-3-30**]):
NO POLYMORPHONUCLEAR LEUKOCYTES SEEN.
NO MICROORGANISMS SEEN.
FLUID CULTURE (Final [**2103-4-2**]):    NO GROWTH.
ANAEROBIC CULTURE (Preliminary):    NO GROWTH.
.
[**2103-4-4**] CXR:
FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, the right
pigtail catheter has been removed. The extrathoracic air
collection with multiple air-fluid levels is unchanged in size
and appearance. The extent of the right pleural effusion has
minimally increased. As a consequence, the amount of ventilated
lung parenchyma at the lung base has decreased. Unchanged
appearance of the left lung.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 88903**] is an 83yM who initially presented to the thoracic
surgery clinic in [**2101**] for an incidentally discovered RUL mass
on routine preoperative CXR.  He underwent PET scanning as well
as EBUS which were negative for malignancy.  He was followed
with surveillance CT scans as he desired conservative management
as opposed to VATS biopsy.  The nodule continued to grow on f/u
CT scan [**1-/2103**] and recommendation was made for resection.

He was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] [**2103-3-21**] at which time he underwent VATS
right upper lobectomy with mediastinal lymphadenectomy.  He was
admitted to the surgical floor postoperatively.  He did well on
POD1 with good pain control and oxygen requirement of 2-4L by
nasal cannula.  On POD2, his chest xray demonstrated progressive
collapse as well as a sizeable pneumothorax.  He underwent
placement of an anterior pigtail for evacuation of the
pneumothorax and was taken to the OR on [**3-23**] for bronchoscopy
for evacuation of mucous plug likely causing lung collapse.

He was admitted to the ICU for aggressive pulmonary toilet and
continued observation.  On [**3-25**], his CXR demonstrated continued
atalectasis and he returned to the OR for a repeat therapeutic
bronchoscopy.

He remained in the ICU receiving 3% normal saline nebulizers as
well as Acapella valve therapy and night-time BiPAP as
tolerated.  His CXRs continued to demonstrated atalectasis with
nearly complete right sided collapse and Interventional
Pulmonology performed two further bedside bronchoscopies for
pulmonary toilet on [**3-27**] and 3.29.  A CT chest was obtained [**3-29**]
and demonstrated an apical pleural effusion which was drained
with a pigtail by Interventional pulmonology.  His last
bronchoscopy was [**3-30**] with IP and resulted in significant
improvement in his CXR with greater aeration.  He was
transferred from the ICU to the surgical floor and began working
with physical therapy.  On his first session, he was noted to
desaturate with ambulation to 75% while on 2L NC.  He continued
to work with physical therapy and his ambulatory saturations
improved.  His pigtail drainage decreased significantly and was
insignificant on [**2103-4-3**] at which time it was removed.  Physical
therapy recommended that he be discharged home with home PT and
home oxygen.

On [**4-3**], his pain was well controlled, he was tolerating a
regular diet and his CXR following pigtail removal was stable.
He was deemed to be stable for discharge with PT recommendations
in place.
