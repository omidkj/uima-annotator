Brief Hospital Course:
Pt was was admitted to the MICU and started on PPI gtt and kept
NPO.  EGD [**10-28**] with large oozing ulcer in anterior bulb at the
site of the prior ulcer surgery and nonbleeding ulcer in post
bulb. Injection/bicap partially successful since position of
scope difficult.  Recommended aspirin be held indefinitely.
Also seen by cards who did not think ACS given no acute ST
changes, trop 0.16, CKMB 13 with Hct 40->26/27.
Post-transfusion hct stable around 33-34.  CK peaked at 226.
Cards recommended possibly re-starting ASA when stable GI wise,
and that she would likely benefit from coronary eval (cath,
stress, etc) although they agreeed she would be a terrible
candidate for stenting.  They also recommended restarting
low-dose BB as BP stable in 140s and HR 80s to decrease O2
demand and continue statin. Surgery was also consulted and
recommended medical management.
On [**10-29**] pt was transferred out of the MICU to CC7.  The PPI gtt
was changed to IV PPI [**Hospital1 **].  Pt continued to deny CP, SOB,
fatigue, abdominal pain, fevers, nausea, vomiting, and did not
have any further melena. Hematocit continued to be stable.  The
diet was advanced on her second day on the floor to clears and
then to full prior to discharge without any signs of abdominal
discomfort or nausea.
Prior to d/c the PPI was changed to oral 40mg [**Hospital1 **]. Aspirin
continued to be held with plan to hold indefinitely.  She was
scheduled with f/u for cards with plan for a stress test as an
outpt given echo findings and likely underlying CAD.  She was
also scheduled with f/u for GI and an EGD with biopsy in order
to biopsy (to look for H. pylori).  BP meds was held during the
hosp and half the dose of home meds started prior to d/c and her
bp was well controlled on these.  The plan was fully discussed
with an interpreter and all their questions had been answered.
When discharged pt was asymptomatic, amulating on own, taking
good po, and off suppl oxygen.
