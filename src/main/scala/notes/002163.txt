Chief Complaint:
Tachycardia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
TKR

History of Present Illness:
   The patient is a 78 y.o. male with dm, htn, dyslipidemia,
djd, atrial fibrillation who was admitted for total knee
replacement surgery which he underwent on [**2167-4-7**]. His post op
course was c/b hypotension for which he was placed on
neosynepherine gtt.  He was weaned off with fluid boluses and
was transfused 1 U prbcs. He then developed atrial fibrillation
with RVR with rates =150. He was asymptomatic. He was given 150
mg IV amiodarone along with 100 mg po amidarone- his home dose.
His atrial fibrillation remained poorly controlled and thus he
was transferred to medicine for further management.

Pertinent Results:
Studies/Imaging:
ECG: Afib at 140
.
CXR: [**4-9**] Small left pleural effusion and adjacent atelectasis
developed yesterday, are stable.  Upper lungs are clear.  Mild
cardiomegaly is unchanged.  Pleural thickening extending from
the right costal pleural surface into the minor fissure has been
present without change since [**2163**], of no active clinical
significance.  Tip of the right central venous line projects
over the SVC.  No pneumothorax, mediastinal widening or right
pleural effusion.
.

[**9-22**] stress:
6 mins on modified [**Doctor First Name **]- test stopped due to fatigue. No
anginal sx
LVEF = 59% and no ischemia identified.
.
Echo:
[**3-/2164**]
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular  hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Overall left  ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF 60%). Right ventricular chamber  size and free wall motion
are normal. The aortic Valve leaflets (3) are mildly  thickened
but not stenotic. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve  leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Trivial  mitral regurgitation is seen. There is no
pericardial effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
78 y.o. M with DM, HTN, Atrial fibrillation/atrial flutter s/p L
TKR whose post op course was complicated by hypotension requring
neo, low grade fevers, cough and atrial fibrillation with rapid
response.
.
1.  CV:
A.  Rhythm: The pt has known Atrial Fibrillation and developed
rapid ventricular response post op.  The etiology of the rapid
ventricular response was initinally unclear, however the ddx
included CHF, COPD flare, PNA, PE, or stress secondary to post
op.  LENIs were negative for DVT, and the CXR was more
consistent with Pulm edema rather than PNA.  He was therefore
treated symptomatically for his Atrial fibrillation and was also
diursed aggressively with lasix to remove the source of
stimulation.  He was loaded on Amiodarone IV but also required
additional nodal agents including beta blockers and a diltiazem
drip for adequate control of his rate.  He was subsequently
weaned off diltiazem and the amiodarone was decreased to a
maintenance dose and he converted to NSR.  In addition, he was
also started on coumadin anticoagulation as well for dual
benefit of Atrial fibrillation and TKR ppx.  At time of
discharge, his medication regimen for Atrial fibrillation
consisted of Amiodarone 200mg once daily as well as metoprolol
25mg [**Hospital1 **] and coumadin 3mg QHS.  The pt should follow up with his
private cardiologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 108411**] in re: to his atrial
fibrillation.  Of note, he was admitted on plendil, HCTZ, BB,
ACEI and amiodraone however the plendil, BB and HCTZ was
discontinued in favor of other antihypertensives with nodal
action as above.  ACEI was continued but at a reduced dose for
additional CAD benefit.
.
B.  Ischemia: Although unlikely, ischemia could not be ruled out
as a cause of rapid ventricular response.  He was therefore
ruled out with enzymes x3.  In addition, ECGs were without acute
ST or T wave changes.  He was continued on ASA, the lisinopril
dose was decreased as above (from 40 to 2.5mg) to allow for more
room for rate control.  Please try to wean down the nitro paste
to off and continue to titrate up the ACEI dose as tolerated as
an outpt once his amiodarone dose is stabilized.  The statin
dose was increased based on lipid panel obtained during the
admission.  The pt was discharged on simvastatin 40mg QHS.
.
C.  Pump: The pt was clinically in overt CHF with pulm edema
visible on CXR as well as physical exam and LE edema with
elevated JVP.  The pt was rate controlled as above and also was
started on afterload reduction with ACEI and he was diuresed
with lasix IV.  He was given 40mg IV lasix with good response.
As an outpt, he should be continued on 80mg PO lasix (the PO
equivalent to IV lasix) with close monitoring of his kidney
function.  He should have daily weight and strict ins and outs
measured to verify appropriate diuresis (with goal of neg
500cc/day) without compromise of kidney function as verified by
routine labs (chem7) drawn atleast twice a week.
.
2.  TKR: The pt underwent a TKR by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on [**2167-4-7**].  He
should be on weightbearing as tolerated on the left leg.
Continue to use the CPM (Continuous Passive Motion) Machine to
improve the range of your knee - 0 to 90 degrees.  He should
continue the keflex for two weeks post discharge, this should
subsequently be followed up by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] as an outpt after the
appointment.  In re: to wound care, please keep incision clean
and dry.  Apply a dry sterile dressing to the wound each day
while it is draining.  Once draning has stopped, you can leave
the wound open to the air.  You may begin showering with a
waterproof dressing over the wound after being discharged from
the hospital.  You can shower normally (no bandage) starting one
week after surgery (as long as there is no drainage from the
wound.  If the wound is draining, wait 24 hours after it has
stopped before showering) - pat the incision dry with a towel,
do not rub the incision.  Do not take a bath, swim or otherwise
submerge your incision in water.  Monitor the wound daily for
signs of infection including redness around the incision that is
warm to the touch, pus-like drainage from the wounds,
fever/chills, temp>101.5, or any other symptoms that concern
you.  Notify Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] if you have any concern for possible
infection.
.
3.  ID: The pt also complained of a productive cough, with low
grade temps and wheezing which was concerning for PNA/bronchitis
vs. COPD exacerbation (given known h/o tobacco use).  Another
consideration was also CHF from massive fluid resuscitation
during TICU stay post op.  The pt was monitored closely for
other signs of infection (chills, rigors, WBC count,
bacteremia).  Blood cultures were NGTD, sputum cultures were
NGTD and UA was also unrevealed.  He was therefore treated
empirically for COPD exacerbation and CHF.  The CHF was treated
as above, while his COPD was managed with the addition of
flovent and standing n
