History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 94891**] is a 67 yo female with a history of hypertension,
diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and past tobacco use who presented to
OSH ED on Saturday, [**2104-6-7**], with several weeks of exertional
chest pain. Upon admission to the OSH pt ruled out for MI with
negative enzymes and negative troponin levels. A nuclear ETT was
performed yesterday, during which the patient exercised for 7
minutes on [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] protocol with no chest pain or shortness of
breath. Nuclear images showed lateral ischemia. Pt is now
transferred for cardiac catheterization and possible surgical
intervention.

Arthritis, s/p Ovarian cyst removal, s/p tonsillectomy, s/p
bilat. cataract removal

Physical Exam:

VS: 118/58 ?????? 149/58 HR 60??????s SR sat 99% RA

Lungs: Clear bilaterally
Heart: S1S2 RRR no m/r/g
Abd: Soft, NTND +BS
Ext: No edema. R DP/PT dop/2+, L DP/PT dop/dop
Feet warm.

Pertinent Results:
[**2104-6-23**] CXR: There has been a recent median sternotomy and
mitral valve replacement. Cardiac and mediastinal contours are
slightly widened but are stable in the postoperative period.
Bilateral pleural effusions, small on the right and small to
moderate on the left, are without change with persistent
adjacent basilar atelectasis. Additional foci of discoid
atelectasis are present in the mid lung regions.
[**2104-6-18**] Echo: PRE CPB No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or
color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and
systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There are simple
atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate central (2+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is a trivial/physiologic
pericardial effusion. POST CPB Normal right ventricular systolic
function. Left ventricle displays mild inferior hypokinesis with
an overall ejection fraction of about 55%. There is a mitral
valve annuloplasty ring in situ. It is well seated. There is now
trace MR. The maximum gradient across the mitral valve is 8.5 mm
Hg with a mean of about 5 mm Hg. At one point in the post CPB
period after surgical maipulation of the heart, the CVP trace
revealed a large V wave and moderate TR was seen on the TEE
exam. This resloved within about 5 minutes to the trace TR seen
pre-CPB. The thoracic aorta appeared intact after decannulation.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 94891**] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2104-6-11**] via transfer
for a cardiac catheterization. This revealed severe three vessel
coronary artery disease and a normal ejection fraction. Given
the severity of her disease, the cardiac surgical service was
consulted for surgical management. Ms. [**Known lastname 94891**] was worked-up in
the usual preoperative manner. Plavix was allowed to clear from
her system. On [**2104-6-18**], Ms. [**Known lastname 94891**] was taken to the operating
room where she underwent coronary artery bypass grafting to five
vessels and a mitral valve repair. Please see operative note for
details. Postoperatively she was taken to the intensive care
unit for monitoring. By postoperative day one, Ms. [**Known lastname 94891**] had
awoke neurologically intact and was extubated. She was then
transferred to the step down unit for monitoring. She was gently
diuresed towards her preoperative weight. The physical therapy
service was consulted for assistance with her postoperative
strength and mobility. Chest tubes and epicardial pacing wires
were removed per protocol. She remained stable over the next
couple days and was discharged home on post-op day five with the
appropriate follow-up appointments.
