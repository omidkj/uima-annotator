Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2485**]
Chief Complaint:
OSH Transfer for Aspiration Pneumonia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 23 yo M with [**First Name3 (LF) **]'s Syndrome who initially
presented to an OSH ([**2176-3-11**]) with aspiration PNA requiring
intubation.  The patiet was at his group home facility ([**Location (un) 32944**]
Village) when he was found to have a blood sugar of 30.  He was
given a can of Ensure orally which he aspirated resulting in
hypoxia.  He was given IM glucagon.  Paramedics attempted to
intubate the patienet but were unsuccessful.  He was brought to
an OSH ER where his O2 sats were 45%, HR 45. He was successfully
intubated.  He was admitted to the OSH MICU.  Sputum cultures
grew MRSA and the patient was started on vancomycin and
clindamycin to cover for aspiration and mrsa pneumonia.  He was
extubated after 2 days, continued on positive pressure
ventilation for another 24 hours and then maintained on
supplemental O2.  He has been continued on his home BiPAP 17/5
at night.  He has been oxygenating well since extubation with
oxygen supplementation.  His initial xray was not remarkable,
but a repeat chest x-ray showed development of bilateral
infiltrates.

During his hospital course the patient had episodes of sinus
tachycardia and was started on a cardizem drip.  He was also
seen by neurology for questionable seizure activity during they
attributed to hypoxia after his aspiration event.  They
recommended continued antiepileptic medication.

The family requested transfer to [**Hospital1 18**] where he has had the
majority of his care. On the day of transfer the patient
received KCL 40mg PO x 3.

Currently denies chest pain, abdominal pain, nausea, or
vomiting.  He reports thirst.

[**11-29**]

[**2176-3-12**] Sputum - MRSA (sensitive to vanco).

Studies:
CXR at OSH:  per report bilateral pulmonary infiltrates
[**2176-3-14**] ECHO - normal LV fxn (60-65%), normal wall motion,
normal chamber size, mild MR, trace AI, mild TR, decreased LV
compliance.

[**2176-3-16**] CXR - The tip of the endotracheal tube is identified at
the thoracic inlet. There is worsening of bilateral multifocal
opacities indicating aspiration pneumonia. There is continued
small bilateral pleural effusion. The heart is normal in size.
No pneumothorax is identified.  There is dilatation of the
stomach.

[**2176-3-17**] CXR - The tip of endotracheal tube is identified at the
thoracic inlet. The nasogastric tube terminates in the gastric
body. No apparent pneumothorax is seen, also both apices are not
included in the radiograph.
There is slight improvement of the extensive aspiration
pneumonia. There is continued small bilateral pleural effusion.
The heart is normal in size.

[**2176-3-18**] ECHO - The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial
septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular
wall thickness, cavity size, and systolic function are normal
(LVEF>55%). Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal.
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with
good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral
valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral
regurgitation. There is no mitral valve prolapse. The estimated
pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.  Compared with the
report of the prior study (images unavailable for review) of
[**2173-9-9**], the findings are similar.  Based on [**2166**] AHA
endocarditis prophylaxis recommendations, the echo findings
indicate a low risk (prophylaxis not recommended).

[**2176-3-19**] Abdominal U/S - No evidence of acute cholecystitis.

[**2176-3-19**] CXR - Slight interval worsening of bilateral diffuse
airspace consolidations. Slight overdistention of the cuff of
the ET tube

[**2176-3-20**] CXR - The apices are not imaged on this study. Tip of
the endotracheal tube again seen approximately 4 cm above the
carina. Tip of orogastric tube seen overlying the stomach.
Otherwise, no significant change from prior study, with
bilateral multifocal opacities consistent with aspiration
pneumonia and bilateral pleural effusions again seen.

[**2176-3-21**] CT Abdomen/Pelvis - 1. Multifocal pneumonia. Small
moderate-sized bilateral pleural effusions. Multiple enlarged
mediastinal and right axillary lymph nodes. This may be
secondary to the patient's current multifocal pneumonia. 2. Mild
amount of ascites and pelvic free fluid.
3. Mildly distended gallbladder with no other evidence of acute
cholecystitis.


Brief Hospital Course:
The patient is a 23 yo M with [**Month/Day/Year **]'s Syndrome who initially
presented to an OSH with aspiration PNA requiring intubation.

Aspiration PNA - The patient arrived from the OSH with bilateral
aspiration and mrsa pneumonia extubated (s/p 2 days on the
ventilator).  The patient was oxygenating well on 40% FM on
admission.  That evening, he became acutely agitated asking for
water.  He dropped his sats to the upper 70's and required
intubation.  He was initally treated with vanco/clindamycin for
aspiration and MRSA pneumonia.  He was switched to
vancomycin/cefepime/flagyl to broaden coverage.  He continued to
be difficult to oxygenate and was switched to pressure control
ventilation.  On hospital day #3, the patient's respiratory rate
was elevated and was unable to maintain O2 sats >88%.  We
paralyzed him with cisatracurium to decrease his respiratory
rate and increase his oxygenation.  He continued to spike fevers
to 104 and became acutely hypotensive.  He was started on
levophed to maintain a MAP >65 and his antibiotics were changed
to vanco/meropenem.  Because he had a history of meropenem
resistent organisms, he was switched back to
vanco/cefepime/flagyl.  He was quickly weaned off the levophed.
Sputum samples grew staph aureus and pseudomonas.  We performed
a CT scan of his torso and sinuses to look for further sources
of infection given his ongoing fevers; he was found to have
multifocal pneumonia.  Over the course of the week, he
progressed to ARDS and developed fibrosis of
