Chief Complaint:
69M w/ hx pancreatic CA dx [**12-12**] s/p multiple CBD stent
placements was admitted on [**2200-9-17**] with acute cholangitis.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
ERCP
7 cm 10 French stent placement

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known firstname 53773**] is a 69 year old Italian speaking gentleman
diagnosed with pancreatic CA in [**12-12**], s/p multiple CBD stent
placements, who presented to an OSH on [**2200-9-15**] with severe
abdominal pain and jaundice.  He had been feeling well since
removal of his last stent in [**7-13**] until [**2200-9-10**], when he told
his family that he wasn't feeling well, with decreased appetite
and malaise that progressed during the next several days.  On
[**2200-9-15**] he experienced onset of severe abdominal pain in the
RUQ and epigastric region with radiation to his back, and was
admitted to [**Hospital3 417**] Hospital.

At the time of admission, Mr. [**Known lastname 7996**] complained of abdominal
pain, anorexia, malaise, weakness, and nausea.  He denied fevers
or chills.  He was afebrile, hemodynamically stable, with no
leukocytosis, so was given IV hydration and analgesia.  During
the first 24 hours of admission, however, he began to look more
toxic and spike low-grade fevers.  He was transferred to the ICU
and started on gentamycin and imipenem, and given one dose of
levofloxacin.  He required oxygen (50% on venting mask) to
maintain sats of 90-94%, but required neither intubation nor
pressors.  Per his niece, the GSH did not have ERCP capabilities
available and he was transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] MICU for ERCP on
the evening of [**2200-9-17**].  At the time of transfer, his labs were
notable for Na 134, Mg 1.6, TBili 19.8, DBili 15.4, and alk phos
of 411, WBC 10.3, and Hct 36.9.  Blood cultures were negative at
the time of transfer.

On his arrival in the [**Hospital1 18**] MICU, Mr. [**Known lastname 7996**] was febrile to
100.6, satting 90-93% on 50% O2 face mask.  He complained of
severe abdominal pain radiating to his back.  He was noted to be
jaundiced and disoriented.  He was started on meropenam and
vancomycin, administered 1 mg Ativan and 5 mg Zydis for anxiety,
and given a total of 6 mg Dilaudid for pain.  His DBili
increased to 27.9, with Dbili 20.0 and Alk [**Doctor Last Name **] 354.  AST was 72,
ALT 40, [**Doctor First Name **] 16, lip 7, albumin 3.1.  Digoxin, initiated in [**5-13**]
following an episode of pulmonary edema, was discontinued as
thought to be contributing to 1st degree heart block noted on
EKG.

ERCP was performed on [**9-18**], and the patient was noted to have a
10 mm long irregular stricture of the lower [**1-11**] CBD.  A 7 cm 10
French stent was placed successfully.  The patient noted
resolution of pain following ERCP.  He was transferred to the
floor on the morning of [**2200-9-20**] for monitoring and evaluation.

The history of Mr. [**Known lastname 53774**] pancreatic cancer is as follows.
He had been in his usual state of good health until [**Month (only) 359**] of
[**2199**], when he began experiencing abdominal pain and anorexia.
He was treated with antibiotics with initial resolution of
symptoms, but through [**Month (only) **] and [**Month (only) 1096**] noted increasing
anorexia.  In the last week of [**Month (only) 1096**] he was admitted to Good
[**Hospital 53775**] Hospital with malaise, RUQ and LUQ post-prandial pain,
and 10 lbs weight loss.  Non-contrast CT at that time showed an
abnormal pancreatic duct with ductal dilation, a cystic lesion
measuring 8 mm in the pancreatic body and a cystic structure in
the tail measuring 1.3 cm.  His common bile duct and his liver
function tests were normal.  ERCP showed stricture of both the
pancreatic duct and intra-pancreatic portion of the CBD, and a
plastic stent was placed in the CBD.  Cytology was negative for
malignant cells.  The patient continued to experience nausea,
vomiting, and abdominal pain, without fever or jaundice.  His
weight had at this time decreased from 120 lbs to 80 lbs.  EUS
with FNA of the pancreatic cystic lesions (head and body) on
[**2200-2-6**] revealed atypical cells and CEA of 416.  His stent was
replaced on [**2200-2-27**].  Based on cytology, the patient was
thought to have either IPMT or mucinous ductal ectasia, and a
Whipple procedure was contemplated for [**2200-6-4**].  TPN was
initiated in preparation for surgery, and the patient gained
back 42 lbs.  An echo showed EF of 65% and an exercise stress
test showed no evidence of ischemia.  However, just before the
procedure, the patient was hospitalized for SOB and was found to
be in pulmonary edema.  Per his niece, plans for surgery in the
immediate future were discontinued secondary to concerns for his
perioperative pulmonary status.  The patient was begun on home
O2 when VNA noted sats in the 80s on room air, asymptomatic from
the patient's perspective.  On repeat ERCP, the CBD stent was
removed on [**2200-7-10**] and not replaced when it was found that a 12
mm balloon could be passed through the stricture.  He did well
at home on solid POs and 3L O2, with good mobility and mental
function, until the symptoms prompting the current admission.
