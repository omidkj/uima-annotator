Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2763**]
Chief Complaint:
femur fracture

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
ORIF of left femur

History of Present Illness:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 109174**] is an 83yoF with a history of advanced Alzheimer's
dementia, atrial fibrillation with RVR, diastolic dysfunction,
CAD s/p previous PCI, HTN, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, PVD,
breast cancer s/p lumpectomy and radiation in [**2095**] who presented
from rehab s/p likely mechanical fall with subsequent left
femoral fracture.
.
She had just been transferred to [**Hospital3 **] for
advancing dementia, though had been known to have significant
sundowning nightly with agitation.  At baseline, she is AAOx0,
she speaks though is incoherent.  She had been wandering without
a walker and sustained a fall.  Admission imaging showed a
severely displaced left metadiaphyseal femur fx with severe
foreshortening.  CT head and cervical spine showed no acute
fracture or displacement.
.
Her hospital course had been complicated by atrial fibrillation
in RVR with rates to the 130s that has responded well to PO
metoprolol 100mg q6hr. Of note, she has a history of apical-form
hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and has outflow physiology at
elevated rates- she had HF symptoms with this recent RVR that
responded to beta blockade.  She has also experienced
intermittent agitation on the medicine floor that seems to have
responded better to seroquel 25mg than haldol, per medicine
attending report.
.
She underwent operative fixation of her left femoral fracture
this afternoon without significant peri or intraoperative
complications.  She tolerated extubation initially but then
became agitated with ABG demonstrating 7.2/77/87 on room air.
She was placed on BiPAP with improvement of her gas to
7.37/54/122. Her pain did not respond to fentanyl, but was
controlled with dilaudid PO 6mg. She was hypoxic on 3L 02 via
nasal cannula, though p02 improved to 94 on 70% shovel mask with
Sats 98%. She was felt to require ICU level care related to the
delicate balance between adequate analgesia and hypoventilation.
 Of note, she was admitted with DNR/DNI status which was
reversed for her surgery.  Per her son, the HCP, she will remain
full code for this immediate peri-operative interval, and can be
intubated if necessary.
.
On arrival to the ICU T98.4 P107 BP137/88 R14 Sat98% 70%Shovel
mask.  She is groaning though cannot articulate her discomfort.
She cannot answer questions.  She is moving all extremities.

Brief Hospital Course:
83 yo woman with dementia, afib with RVR, cardiomyopathy, CAD
s/p stenting, and recent femoral fracture transferred to ICU
with hypoxia/hypercarbia following extubation requiring BiPAP,
now on room air.
.
# POST-EXTUBATION HYPERCARBIA/HYPOXIA:  She began retaining C02
after extubation with an acute respiratory acidosis and hypoxia
to the 50s.  Her hypercarbia may be narcotic-induced
hypoventilation from the preceding surgery, however this should
not cause significant AA gradient unless the hypoventilation was
profound.  Her hypoxia may also have been related to a
post-operative atelectasis or even mild congestion each with
subsequent V/Q mismatch. She came to MICU [**3-21**]. From a
respiratory standpoint she continued to require oxygen
alternating between nasal cannula and oxygen face mask. [**3-25**] she
was noted to have a new infiltrate on CXR likely to due
aspiration and subsequently had increasing 02 requirement,
antibiotics started. [**3-26**] she was made CMO after extensive
family meeting with MICU team and palliative care and patient
passed away [**3-27**].

# LEFT FEMORAL FRACTURE S/P OPERATIVE FIXATION: Surgery went
without incident, but patient required BIPAP post extubation and
was transfered to the intensive care unit. Pain controlled with
IV hydromorphone.

# ATRIAL FIBRILLATION WITH RVR:  She has intermittently been in
RVR during this hospitalization with rates to the 160 that were
difficult to control despite fluid bolus, lopressor, diluadid.
Her blood pressures held well throughout these episodes.
Attempts at pain control, anxiety control and rate control
including esmolol gtt were mostly unsuccessful, though she did
seem to improve slightly with IV metoprolol Q4H.
.
# ADVANCED ALZHEIMER'S DEMENTIA: She has been frequently
agitated with significant sundowning.  Has received both haldol
and seroquel. Her likely aspiration event showing the pneumonia
[**3-25**] was likely due to her altered mental status.
.
# DIASTOLIC DYSFUNCTION: Patient became volume overloaded and
had increasing oxygen requirements with increasing Cr and was
not able to be effectively diuresed.
.
# CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE: S/P LAD PCI in past.  Unable to
continue home cardiac meds due to NPO status.
.
# HYPOTHYROIDISM: continued levothyroxine.
.
# ANEMIA: down from recent baseline of 38.8. Likely 2/2 blood
loss due to fracture and correction of hemoconcentration.  Iron
studies and b12/folate unrevealing. No grossly bloody stools.
.
# HEPATITIS C: followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  Due to chronicity
and her age, never underwent treatment.
