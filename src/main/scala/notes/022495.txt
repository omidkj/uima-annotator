Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 425**]
Chief Complaint:
chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
cardiac catheterization with LAD bare-metal stent placed and
balloon angioplasty.


History of Present Illness:
Patient is a [**Age over 90 **] yo female with pmhx HTN, atrial fibrillation,
hyperlipidemia who presented with chest pain starting yesterday
afternoon. She characterizes the chest pain as a pressure.
Patient has never had this chest pain before. She reports that
the pain came on suddenly and lasted for approx an hour. The
pain came and went the whole day. Pain was not associated with
dyspnea, sob, nausea, vomiting. However, patient notes that she
has been more short of breath over the last couple days and
noted diaphoresis yesterday with walking. Walking did not worsen
the chest pain. Patient was able to sleep without pain last
night, but remembers waking up with the pain. She denies PND,
orthopnea, LE edema. At baseline, patient walks only to the
bathroom and dining [**Doctor Last Name **] from her room at [**Hospital 100**] Rehab.
.
EKG done at rehab showed st segment elevations and patient was
sent emergently to the ED. Initial vital signs T 98.3, HR 73, BP
198/99, R 22, 94% RA. Patient was started on heparin gtt,
integrillin, plavix 600, ASA 325, NTG bolus and taken to cardiac
cath where PCI showed LAD with 70% mid just beyond origin of
major diagonal, 90% mid-distal LAD, large diag with 90% complex
lesion proximally.  She had a bare-metal stent placed in her D1
vessel and had balloon angioplasty of the mid-LAD lesion.
.
On transfer to the floor, patient was HD stable and feeling well
without chest pain, sob, abd pain, nausea, leg or back pain. Her
initial vs were BP 194/90 P 72 O2 97% 1 liter.
.
On review of symptoms, she denies any prior history of deep
venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of
surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools
or red stools. She denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.

Cardiac catheterization: PTCA COMMENTS:
Initial angiography revealed a severe 90% lesion in the ist
diagonal at the bifurcation of the LAD ( smaller vessel). The
LAD had a 70% stenosis at bifurcation and 90% stenosis beyond
it. We planned to perform PTCA to the mid LAD and then stent the
1st diagonal with rescue of the LAD if needed. Heparin and
Integrilin was commenced prohylactically. An XB LAD 3.0 guide
engaged the LCA providing adequate support. A CPT floppy wire
crossed the diagonal lesion easily. A Prowater wire crossed into
the LAD. PTCA to the mid LAD was performed with a 2.0x12mm
Voyager balloon inflated to 12atms. Small dissection noted. We
then turned our attention to the diagonal vessel. The proximal
diagonal was predilated with the 2.0mm balloon and then stented
with a 2.5x18mm Mini Vision stent deployed to 15atms. This was
postdilated with a 2.75x15mm Powersail balloon inflated to
12atms. Excellent result with normal flow down vessel and no
residual stenosis. We then decided to perform further prolonged
PTCA to the mid LAD to treat the small dissection. The LAD was
easily crossed through the diagonal stent with the CPT floppy
wire. PTCA was performed with the 2.0mm balloon inflated for 3
minutes. Excellent result with normal flow down vessel and no
residual stenosis.
.
Ecchocardiogram
The left atrium is normal in size. The estimated right atrial
pressure is 5-10 mmHg. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. The left  ventricular cavity size is normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is moderately
depressed (LVEF= 30-40 %) secondary to extensive apical
hypokinesis. There is no ventricular septal defect. The right
ventricular free wall is hypertrophied. Right ventricular
chamber size is normal. There is focal hypokinesis of the apical
free wall of the right ventricle. The number of aortic valve
leaflets cannot be determined. The aortic valve leaflets are
moderately thickened. There is mild aortic valve stenosis (area
1.2-1.9cm2).  Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to
acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may be
significantly UNDERestimated.] The tricuspid valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. The supporting structures of the tricuspid
valve are thickened/fibrotic. Moderate [2+] tricuspid
regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.


Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: Patient is a [**Age over 90 **] yo female who presented with chest pain and
was found to have anterior STEMI.
# CV
--ischemia- Ms. [**Name14 (STitle) 97028**] was started in the ED on aspirin,
plavix, integrillin and taken urgently to cath where she was
found to have 90% occlusion of a large/dominant D1 artery which
was treated with a bare-metal-stent.  She also had a
diffusely-diseased small LAD with 90% mid-stenosis which was
treated with balloon angioplasty that was complicated by a small
dissection (this was further treated with balloon inflation x 3
minutes with good result).  She was asymptomatic on transfer to
CCU and denied chest pain throughout her stay.  She was begun on
atorvastatin, and her metoprolol was titrated up to 100mg [**Hospital1 **] in
addition to her lisinopril 40mg daily.
.
--pump- Ms. [**Known lastname 97029**] ecchocardiogram showed an EF of 30-40%
with moderate mitral and tricuspid regurgitation.  She was kept
on her BB and ACE inhibitor.  she required no diuretics, however
this should be monitored on an outpatient basis
.
--rhythm- Patient has h/o paroxysmal afib and was not
anticoagulated on admission.  She had no a-fib while in-house,
and because of her markedly-easy bruisability we decided to not
anticoagulate her.
