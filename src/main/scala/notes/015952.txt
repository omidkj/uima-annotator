Conclusions
There is mild to moderate regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction with EF 40%. The right ventricular cavity is mildly
dilated with focal hypokinesis of the apical free wall. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good
leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic
regurgitation. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is moderate
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was brought to the Operating Room urgently on [**2167-4-18**]
where the patient underwent CABG x 4 with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **].   Overall
the patient tolerated the procedure well and post-operatively
was transferred to the CVICU in stable condition for recovery
and invasive monitoring. IABP was removed on POD 1.  She was
extubated on POD 2.  The patient was neurologically intact and
hemodynamically stable, weaned from inotropic and vasopressor
support.  Orthopedics was consulted for post knee replacement
recommendations. She will be treated with Lovenox for 3 weeks
and will continue to use  the CPM.  Beta blocker was initiated
and the patient was gently diuresed.  She had continued lower
extremity edema and Lasix was increased to twice a day for 1
week.  The patient was transferred to the telemetry floor for
further recovery.  Chest tubes and pacing wires were
discontinued without complication.  The patient was evaluated by
the physical therapy service for assistance with strength and
mobility.  She did initially post op have elevated liver
function tests (Tbili peak 6.4) but these were trending down at
the time of discharge.  They are to be rechecked in 1 week at
rehab and if are elevated at that time, the decision to stop
Lipitor should be made.  By the time of discharge on POD 5 the
patient was ambulating with assistance. Her wounds were healing
and pain was controlled with oral analgesics.  The patient was
discharged to [**Hospital6 **] in [**Location (un) 38**] in good condition
with appropriate follow up instructions.
