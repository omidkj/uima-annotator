Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 613**]
Chief Complaint:
s/p fall

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
65 y.o. female with PMHx of COPD, esophageal stricture s/p
dilatation in [**Month (only) 404**] who presents with a chief complaint of
falls. Patient reports a long history of falls, with 1 fall each
day for the past 3 consecutive days. She reports some dizziness
occasionally prior to these falls, but otherwise denies prodrome
of chest pain, SOB, palpitations. She reports hitting her head
with her falls, but denies LOC. She also recently fell on her
right chest and has had subsequent pain. She attributes her
falls to decreased vision (has a history of cataracts s/p two
surgeries on the right, many years ago) and is also supposed to
ambulate with a walker, but doesn't always comply. She also
wears 2 liters of oxygen at baseline and has noted that she
occasionally trips over her oyxgen tubing while trying to
ambulate. She thus primarily comes in with a complaint of falls,
but noted a cough productive of yellow/brown sputum for the past
2 months with subjective fevers (sweats) for which she was
further evaluated. She reports her grandchildren as well as a
gentleman in her building as potential sick contacts, but
otherwise denies any recent travel or exposures. She does report
getting her flu shot last year and receiving her pneumovax 2
years ago.
.
In the ED, patient was noted to be tachycardic to the 120s and
hypoxic to 89% on RA. This improved to 96% on NRB after a failed
attempt with nasal cannula. Patient was also noted to have a
lactate of 3.3 and a leukocytosis to 22.8 with a bandemia of 9%.
CXR showed right middle and lower lobe infiltrates, concerning
for PNA and given hypoxia, lactic acidosis and leukocytosis,
patient was started on Levofloxacin and Ceftriaxone. Otherwise,
patient was noted to have acute renal failure from 0.6 to 1.3
and she was given 1 L of NS. Additionally, potassium of 2.4 was
repleted. EKG was performed which was unremarkable, but troponin
x 1 was elevated to 0.05 in the setting of ARF and ASA was
given. Patient was asymptomatic otherwise. Lastly, given history
of recent falls, CT neck and head were performed without
evidence of fracture or bleed. Patient was subsequently admitted
to the ICU for further management of probable pneumonia with
significant hypoxia and bandemia.
.
Upon arrival in the ICU, patient was on NRB, speaking in full
sentences, not in acute distress. She complained of right sided
chest pain due to her fall and also endorsed dysuria and
hematuria. Otherwise, she had no complaints.
