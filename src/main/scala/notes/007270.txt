Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Levofloxacin / Lisinopril / Diphenhydramine

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3531**]
Chief Complaint:
S/p arrest in the OR during IP stent procedure.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Left main stem stent placement.
Endotracheal intubation.
Left femoral tripple lumen catheter placement.

History of Present Illness:
69 y/o F with PMHX of COPD and Small Cell Lung Cancer (diagnosed
[**2159**]) s/p XRT/chemo/tumor debridement/R mainstem bronchus stent
placement ([**2164**]) and recent LUE DVT on Coumadin who initially
presented to [**Hospital 1474**] hospital on [**3-27**] with 3-4 episodes of
hemoptysis, increased cough, wheezing and shortness of breath.
She was started on IV SoluMedrol 125mg IV q6hrs, Nebs and
tessalon pearles. She was supratherapeutic with an INR of 4.1
and Coumadin was held. CTA was negative for PE and revealed
right mainstem stent with distal intraluminal narrowing or tumor
effusion, mediastinal and subcarinal confluent metastatic
lymphadenopathy. Decision was made for transfer to [**Hospital1 18**] for
bronch and IP evaluation.
.
Pt was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] and was continued on steroids, nebs and
cough suppressants.  She went for flexible bronchoscopy on [**3-30**]
which revealed normal trachea, extensive tumor at carina
obstructing both mainstem bronchi, extrinsic mediastinal
compression of L mainstem and unable to visualize stent in right
mainstem due to intraluminal tumor.
Pt was taken to the OR on [**4-1**] and had stent placed in the left
mainstem with good result.  There was attempted argon plasma
coagulation inside of the right stent to remove intraluminal
obstruction.  During this procedure, pt became progressively
hypoxic, bradycardic and loss of pulse at approx 3:38pm. CPR was
started immediately and pt received a total of 2mg of epi.
After approximately 2-3minutes of CPR, rhythm was checked and
there was a palpable pulse with HR >100 and sbp >180.  TEE was
performed and showed bubbles in the right atrium suggestive of
APC related air embolism but no RV dilation suggestive of acute
PE.  Oxygen sats recovered into the 90s, right femoral a-line
and left femoral CVL was placed.  Pt was given an additional
bolus of Midazolam and some neosynephrine for BP support prior
to transfer to the ICU.
.
On arrival to the ICU, pt was intubated and sedated with HR >100
and BP 140/90s.  Sedation was rapidly weaned and pt was clearly
responding to commands and moving all extremities.

Past Medical History:
1. Small Cell lung cancer - diagnosed in [**2159**] and recurred in
[**2161**]. Initially started 6 weeks of XRT, followed by multiple
regimens of chemo. Has been off chemo for the last 4 months
"because CT scans have been stable." Last bronchoscopy was in
[**2165-12-23**] - small amounts of granulation tissue seen in
stent.
2. Recent LUE DVT (mid-[**2166-2-20**]) - L arm port was changed,
after which she developed dramatic swelling from shoulder to
wrist; UENIs confirmed LUE DVT. Coumadin 5mg was started.
3. COPD - longstanding, unknown date of diagnosis
4. Lupus - diagnosed 8 years ago after work-up for painful knee
and finger joints (L finger joints > R finger joints) - treated
with "pills" but not prednisone
5. Shingles infection in T10 dermatome in [**10/2165**] - treated with
acyclovir and recovered within 1 week
5. Anxiety/Insomnia

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:
1. Right eye cataract surgery
2. Bronchial stent placement in [**2165-2-20**] by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name (STitle) **]
3. Lung cancer tumor debridement and ablation in [**2165-2-20**] by
Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name (STitle) **]

Social History:
She lives in [**Hospital1 1474**] with her husband. She has 4 children and 7
grandchildren who live within a mile of her house. She worked as
a homemaker. She smoked tobacco for approximately 20 pack years
(1 pack per day for 20+ years) and quit in the [**2145**]. She does
not know of any asbestos exposure. She drinks alcohol only on
social occasions and uses no other drugs.

Family History:
She reports no family history of lung cancer, SLE, or CAD. Her
mom died of "stomach cancer" at 51yo and her niece has breast
cancer. Her son has [**Name2 (NI) **].

Known treated right upper lobe mass with expected post-treatment

change and soft tissue density seen in a right paramediastinal
location is
stable. New mild bilateral pleural effusions. Otherwise no
significant

There is a linear region of decreased diffusion within the right

frontal lobe, predominantly involving the cortex and subcortical
white matter, as well as multiple additional punctate foci of
decreased diffusion within the biparieto-occipital lobes,
including extending into the splenium of the corpus callosum on
the right. There is an additional focus of abnormal slow
diffusion within the inferior aspect of the right cerebellar
hemisphere, measuring 1.5 cm, with associated brisk enhancement.
There is [**Doctor Last Name **] enhancement over the right frontal lobe signal
abnormalities described above. All of the regions of decreased
diffusion have associated T2 signal abnormality. There are no
regions of abnormal marrow replacement, despite limitations by
motion artifact. Focus of su
