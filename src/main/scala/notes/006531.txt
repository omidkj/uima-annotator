Flagyl

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2704**]
Chief Complaint:
referred for left carotid angiography and intervention

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2181-6-5**] Stent to LCA

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 12303**] is a 77 year old woman with history of TIA in [**5-/2181**],
stroke in [**2175**], hypertension, dyslipidemia, CAD s/p CABG in
[**2-/2179**], referred for left carotid stenting. In [**5-/2181**], she
developed a left facial droop and slurred speech. MRI showed an
old right parietal infarct with no evidence of acute infarct.
Subsequent MRA showed greater than 70% stenosis of the left
internal carotid artery and occluded right ICA. Antegrade flow
was demonstrated in both vertebral arteries. An ultrasound was
also done, demonstrating a peak velocity across the [**Doctor First Name 3098**] of
458cm/sec and an ICA/CCA ratio of 5.8. She refused carotid
endarterectomy, and was referred to [**Hospital1 18**]/Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] for carotid
angiography and intervention.
.
During the procedure, she developed hypotension when the balloon
was inflated and was started on a neosynephrine drip with good
response in her blood pressure. There were no neurologic
sequela, and a final angiogram demonstrated good flow without
dissection and intact intracerebral circulation.
.
She reports prior history of stroke and TIA as above. She denies
history of deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding
at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough,
hemoptysis, black stools or red stools. He denies recent fevers,
chills or rigors. He denies exertional buttock or calf pain, or
lightheadedness. All of the other review of systems were
negative. Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of
chest pain, dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea,
orthopnea, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.


Past Medical History:
- CAD s/p CABG in [**2179**] at [**Hospital1 2177**]

- COPD
- CVA in [**2175**] (found to have totally occluded [**Country **]), mild
residual memory deficits
- Hypertension

- s/p CCY
- C. difficile infection in [**2179**]
.
Cardiac History:
CABG, in [**2179**] (at [**Hospital1 2177**]), anatomy unknown


Social History:
Lives alone but has several children involved in her care.
Denies current alcohol. Heavy smoker until [**2174**]. She worked for
35 years as a therapy assistant in a nursing home. She is
independent in self-care, home making activities, is able to
climb stairs and do most housekeeping. No routine exercise
program. Some deficits with short term and medium term memory
loss.

Family History:
There is a strong family history of atherosclerotic disease.
Both her parents died at 62 of myocardial infarctions. She has
no siblings.

Gen: WDWN elderly woman in NAD, resp or otherwise. Oriented x3.
Mood, affect appropriate. Pleasant.
HEENT: NCAT. Sclera anicteric. PERRL, EOMI. Conjunctiva were
pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
Neck: Supple, could not assess JVP as patient required to remain
supine.
CV: PMI located in 5th intercostal space, midclavicular line.
Atrial fibrillation, rate 57. normal S1, S2. No S3. II/VI
systolic murmur at apex.
Chest: Exam limited by supine position. No chest wall
deformities, scoliosis or kyphosis. Resp were unlabored, no
accessory muscle use. No crackles, wheeze, rhonchi.
Abd: Obese, soft, NTND, No HSM or tenderness. No abdominial
bruits.
Ext: No clubbing or cyanosis. Evidence of skin darkening c/w
chronic venous stasis, some hair loss R>L. Trace edema
bilaterally. DP and PT pulses 1+ BL. No bruit or hematoma at
catheter insertion site.
Skin: + stasis dermatitis, left leg scar c/w SVG. No ulcers or
xanthomas.
Pulses: Palpation of carotid and femoral arteries deferred in
light of recent procedure. No carotid or femoral bruits.
Neuro: A&O x 3. CN II-XII intact. Full strength exam deferred
given patient required to remain supine.


Pertinent Results:
EKG: Normal sinus rhythm at 67bpm. Q waves in III and aVF. Poor
R wave progression. Normal axis, normal intervals. TWF in III,
aVF, V3. No ST segment elevations or depressions.
.
Echo [**2181-5-23**]: 1+ mitral regurgitation. Hyperdynamic left
ventricle, LVEF 70%.
.
CAROTID ANGIOGRAM/CATHETERIZATION ([**2181-6-5**]): Patent bilateral
vertebrals. There is occlusion of the right ICA. The left ICA
and ECA were visualized and patent. The left ICA had a high
grade occlusive lesion of approximately 90% with some
calcification. Just distal to the stenosis there was a moderate
angulation with the remainder of the cervical ICA without
tortuosity or angulations. The left MCA and ACA were patent
without aneurysm or lesions. A 6.0 Spider distal protection was
delivered. There was hypotension responsive to Neo drip. A
8/6x40 Protege was delivered and post dilated with 4.5 mm
balloon at 8atm. There were no neurologic sequela and stable
hemodynamics on a Neo drip. final angiogram demonstrated good
flow no dissection with intact intracerebral circulation.

Brief Hospital Course:
 77yF with history of CVA in [**2175**] and recent TIA, 70-90%
stenosis of [**Doctor First Name 3098**], presented for elective angiography and
stenting of the left internal carotid artery.    SHe underwent
PCI of her L. ICA.  Post procedure she was placed on a
neosynephrine drop for hypotension.  SHe was monitored in the
ICU.  Her neo gtt was weaned off.  She had no complications.
her home anti-HTN medications were held on dishcarge and she had
scheduled follow up with her cardiologist on discharge to
discuss resuming her medications.
