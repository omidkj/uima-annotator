Brief Hospital Course:
Resp - Pt was intubated shortly after admission.  Upon
intubation the pt's sats returned to high 90's.  Pt thought to
be experiencing COPD exacerbation and given azith and steroids,
but CXR was more consistant with heart failure.  She stabalized
with aggresive BP control and dialysis removoal of [**6-25**] L.  Pt
weaned from vent and extubated on [**7-10**] and developed flash
edema.  The edema resolved on dialysis, hydralyzine, and lasix.
She was transfered to the floor on [**7-11**].
Pt received an echo in MICU which demonsrtated no change in pts

cardiologist in past and no further work up of MR was done.

later found to be VRE and Linezolid started [**7-11**].  Also BAL from
bronch [**7-10**] revealed pseudomonas and Ceftaz started [**7-11**].  Upon
arival to floor SBP fell to hihg 80's which was thought to be
due to dialysis or possible sepsis from UTI, lungs, or line.
