CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Shortness of breath/rigors.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 77-year-old
male with a past medical history significant for [**Year (4 digits) **]
cancer status post radiation therapy/hormonal therapy, who
presented to the Emergency Department on the morning of [**2163-5-26**], with shortness of breath and rigors.

Per the patient's wife, the patient awoke that morning
noticeably short of breath and appeared to be disoriented.

The patient was taken emergently to the Emergency Department.
His initial vital signs were notable for a heart rate of 120,
respirations 36-40, and an oxygen saturation of 75-86 percent
on 100 percent nonrebreather.

The patient was emergently intubated in the Emergency
Department.  A stat chest x-ray disclosed a left lower lobe
opacity consistent with pneumonia.  The patient's initial ABG
was 7.41, 30, 49, with a lactate of 5.  The sepsis protocol
was initiated.

The patient was administered intravenous fluids and
transiently required treatment with Levophed and Dopamine
while in the Emergency Department.

Ventilator settings were optimized to improve the patient's
oxygenation.  The patient received a total of 6.4 L of fluid
in he Emergency Department.  He was also administered
Azithromycin, Vancomycin, Ceftriaxone, and Cefepime.

The patient was transferred to the MICU for further
management.

injections at the [**Hospital **] Clinic given his history of
anemia.

Diabetes type 2.  The patient is managed on oral hypoglycemic
medications.

denied history of alcohol and tobacco use.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  General:  The patient was intubated
and sedated.  Vital signs:  In the Emergency Department
initially were a temperature of 96.2, heart rate 120, blood
pressure 156/79, respirations 36-40, oxygen saturation 75-86
percent on a nonrebreather.  In the Intensive Care Unit, the
patient's vital signs were a temperature of 96.2, blood
pressure 147/72, heart rate 86, respirations 23, oxygen
saturation 91 percent on assist-controlled ventilation.
HEENT:  Normocephalic, atraumatic.  Pupils equal, round and
reactive to light.  Moist mucous membranes.  There was a
large parotid gland.  Neck:  Supple.  Left subclavian line in
place.  Cardiovascular:  Tachycardiac.  S1 and S2.  No
murmurs, rubs, or gallops.  Lungs:  Decreased breath sounds
at the left base, clear on the right.  Abdomen:  Soft,
nontender, nondistended.  positive bowel sounds.  He had
bilateral nephrostomy tubes present.  Extremities:  No
clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.  He had a surgical of the left
lower extremity.  Neurologic:  He was intubated and sedated.
Pupils equal, round and reactive to light.  Rectal:  Guaiac
positive.

LABORATORY DATA:  CBC notable for a white count of 19.7,
hematocrit 33.9, platelet count 503, differential disclosed
95 percent neutrophils, 0 percent bands, 3 percent
lymphocytes; chemistries notable for a sodium of 132,
potassium 5.4, chloride 94, bicarbonate 19, BUN 40,
creatinine 1.8 from his baseline of 1.1, glucose 389, anion
gap was 19, calcium 8.5, phosphate 3.9, magnesium 1; PT 14.1,
INR 1.3, PTT 25.8; ALT 12, AST 19, total bilirubin 0.6,
alkaline phosphatase 87, albumin 3.1; urinanalysis was clear,
there was no evidence of infection; blood cultures and urine
cultures were drawn.

Electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia at a rate of 116
beats per minute, normal intervals, normal axis, evidence for
left ventricular hypertrophy.

Chest x-ray disclosed an ill-defined left lower lobe opacity,
most likely consistent with pneumonia.  There was also a
small left lung pleural effusion.  Right lung remained clear.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  This is a 77-year-old man with a
history of [**Name (NI) **] cancer, diabetes mellitus, and
hypertension, presenting with acute hypoxic respiratory
failure secondary to community-acquired pneumonia.

Respiratory failure:  The patient was admitted to the Medical
Intensive Care Unit for treatment of community-acquired
pneumonia.  The patient was administered Ceftriaxone,
Azithromycin, and Vancomycin.  The patient was maintained on
mechanical ventilation.  He was administered metered dose
inhalers, and sputum culture was sent to the laboratory.
Sputum culture grew oropharyngeal flora.

Two days into his admission, the patient was greatly improved
from respiratory status and was successfully extubated.
Vancomycin was discontinued after 48 hours of negative blood
cultures.  The patient continued on Ceftriaxone and
Azithromycin for treatment of community-acquired pneumonia.
He should complete a 14-day course of these medications.

Septic shock:  As noted above, the patient required pressor
support for blood pressure, given hypotension in the
Emergency Department.  The patient was initiated on MUST
sepsis protocol.  As noted above, the patient was
administered Vancomycin, Ceftriaxone, and Azithromycin to
cover infectious sources.  The patient was pancultured, and
to date, cultures remain negative.  The patient also received
6.4 L of fluid in the Emergency Department to maintain his
CVP greater than 10.  By the time he reached the Medical
Intensive Care Unit, he no longer required pressors.

A cortisol stimulation test was done given that the patient
chronically received steroids for his [**Name (NI) **] cancer.  The
patient was considered a nonresponder, and therefore he was
started on stress-dose steroids.  Three days into his
hospital course, however, stress-dose steroids were
discontinued since the patient's blood pressures remained
stable.  The patient was placed back on his home regimen of
Hydrocortisone 20 mg in the morning and 10 mg at night.
Three days into the patient's admission, he was restarted on
his blood pressure medications.

Acute renal failure:  On presentation the patient had a BUN
and creatinine of 40/1.8 with a baseline creatinine around 1.
As noted above, the patient has a history of obstructive
uropathy secondary to urethral obstruction due to his
malignancy and history of radiation therapy.  There was
concern for ATN given the patient's hypotension; however, it
was likely that the patient's acute renal failure was
secondary to prerenal azotemia, since renal function has
improved with the administration of fluids.  The patient
continues to make urine which is draining through his
bilateral nephrostomy tubes.

Anemia:  The patient has a long-standing history of anemia
and currently gets Aranesp at his [**Hospital **] Clinic; last dose
was administered on [**5-21**].  The patient's baseline
hematocrit is 26-29.  Of note, the patient had guaiac
positive stools on presentation.  He had a colonoscopy in
[**2162-7-6**] which disclosed diverticulosis of the sigmoid
colon.  The patient was administered 1 U packed red blood
cells on [**5-28**] for a hematocrit of 22.  Since then, his
hematocrit has remained stable.

[**Month (only) 9197**] cancer:  The patient is followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 10777**].  The
patient's mo
