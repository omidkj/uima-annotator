Service:  Medicine, [**Hospital1 **] Firm

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is 71-year-old male with a
past medical history of chronic abdominal pain (status post
esophagogastroduodenoscopy on [**2126-6-11**] showing
gastritis), depression, hypothyroidism, and hypertension who
presented with abdominal pain to the Emergency Department on
[**2126-6-15**] associated with nausea, vomiting, decreased oral
intake, and decreased urine output.

Laboratories at the time of Emergency Department presentation
were notable for a lipase of greater than 6000, amylase
of 1321, elevated white blood cell count at 14.9 (with 7%
bands).  Blood glucose was 136.  LDH of 1156 and AST of 866.
Vital signs on presentation were temperature of 99.9, heart
rate of 125, blood pressure of 145/98, respirations of 18,
pulse oximetry of 95% on room air.  A CT scan of the abdomen
showed moderate peripancreatic and perigallbladder fat
stranding, and a small amount of gas in the gallbladder.  The
patient was admitted to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit
after receiving ceftriaxone 2 g, Flagyl 500 mg, and
levofloxacin 500 mg, as well as Demerol and intravenous
morphine for pain control in the Emergency Department.  The
patient also received fluid resuscitation with 5 liters of
normal saline.

The patient was presumed to have gallstones pancreatitis, and
an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography was
performed on [**6-16**] showing frank pus at the major papilla,
cholangitis, successful extraction of sludge and stone
fragments, and a sphincterotomy was performed.

Following endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, the
plan was to take the patient for laparoscopic
cholecystectomy, but surgery was delayed secondary to
congestive heart failure treated with Lasix, and rapid atrial
fibrillation (treated with a diltiazem drip).  Status post
endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, the patient
developed respiratory distress and a new oxygen requirement
which was considered to be pulmonary edema but was also noted
to have an elevated creatinine.

Cardiology was consulted on [**6-18**] and recommended continuing
with Lopressor and Lasix.  An echocardiogram showed an
ejection fraction of greater than 55%.  As part of the
congestive heart failure evaluation, a Swan-Ganz catheter was
placed on [**6-18**] showing a central venous pressure of 16, a
pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 28, and a cardiac
output of 6.6.

Because of the elevated creatinine and difficulty diuresing
the patient, the Renal Service was consulted on [**6-18**] as
well for management of fluid overload. Recommendations from
the Renal Service were to continue Lasix with electrolyte
repletion, renal dosing of medications, and to add D-5 water
for hypernatremia.  A renal ultrasound showed no renal artery
stenosis or hydronephrosis.

Between [**6-16**] and [**6-20**], the patient was treated with
ampicillin, levofloxacin, and metronidazole.  On [**6-20**], the
patient was transferred to the Surgery floor at which time
the antibiotics were discontinued, and the patient began
tolerating a clear liquid diet.  On [**6-21**], the patient was
transferred to the Medicine Service for management of medical
issues.

MEDICATIONS ON TRANSFER:  Medications on transfer from the
Surgical Service included Flomax 0.4 mg p.o. q.d.,
Levoxyl 50 mcg p.o. q.d., Protonix 40 mg p.o. q.d.,
metoprolol 75 mg p.o. b.i.d., subcutaneous heparin 5000 units
b.i.d.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is married, and his wife has
[**Name (NI) 2481**] disease.  He has a total of three children; one
of whom is deceased.  He denies tobacco or alcohol use.  He
is a retired custodian.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Vital signs revealed a
temperature of 98.3, blood pressure of 156/80, heart rate
of 80, respirations of 20, pulse oximetry of 92% on room air.
Generally, a pleasant and somewhat anxious-appearing male who
was otherwise comfortable, in no apparent distress.  Head,
eyes, ears, nose, and throat revealed pupils were equal,
round, and reactive to light.  No scleral icterus.  Mucous
membranes were moist and without lesions.  Neck was supple
without adenopathy or elevated jugular venous distention.
Heart had a regular rate and rhythm.  First heart sound and
second heart sound were present.  Positive fourth heart
sound.  No third heart sound or murmur.  There was a left
internal jugular catheter which was intact.  Lungs were clear
to auscultation bilaterally.  The abdomen revealed bowel
sounds were present, soft, nontender, and nondistended.  No
masses.  Extremities revealed trace lower extremity edema.
Foley was in place.  Skin was warm and dry.  No jaundice.
Neurologically, alert and oriented times three.  No gross
deficits.

PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:  Laboratories on
transfer revealed white blood cell count of 13.3, hematocrit
of 38.2, platelets of 224.  Potassium of 3.5, blood urea
nitrogen of 24, creatinine of 1.5, glucose of 81.  ALT of 77,
AST of 55, alkaline phosphatase of 162, amylase of 29, lipase
of 49, and total bilirubin of 0.9.  Calcium of 8.2, magnesium
of 1.8, phosphorous of 3.7.  Thyroid-stimulating hormone
of 7.8.

RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  A chest x-ray on [**6-20**] revealed left
internal jugular catheter placement, decreased right upper
lobe atelectasis, consolidation versus atelectasis in the
left retrocardiac space.

HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM:  The bulk of the hospital course
occurred on the Surgical Service, and is per the summary in
the History of Present Illness.

1.  CARDIOVASCULAR:  The patient had converted to sinus
rhythm on the Surgical Service after being rated controlled
for atrial fibrillation with diltiazem.  He was transiently
placed on a beta blocker for blood pressure and rate control.
In terms of volume status, the patient was felt to be
clinically euvolemic when transferred to the Medicine
Service, and further diuresis was held.

2.  PULMONARY:  On transfer to the Medicine Service, the
patient had stable oxygen saturations on room air and was
noted to have atelectasis by chest x-ray.  The patient
remained on room air throughout the hospitalization without
further pulmonary complications.

3.  RENAL:  At the time of transfer, the patient's creatinine
had returned to its baseline of approximately 1.5.  Further
diuresis was held.  The patient continued to make adequate
urine output.

4.  INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  The patient was afebrile on transfer
and was noted to have a slightly evaluated white blood cell
count to 13.3 which had decreased to 9.8 by the time of
discharge.  Culture data showed no growth to date from blood
cultures drawn on [**6-18**] or [**6-23**].  Urine cultures from
[**6-21**] showed no growth.  After the left internal jugular
catheter was discontinued on [**6-21**], the culture of the
catheter tip showed no growth.

At the time of discharge, the patient was sent home with a
10-day course of ciprofloxacin 500 mg p.o. b.i.d. and
instructed to call his primary care physician should he
develop fevers, recurrent abdominal pain, or vomiting.

5.  GASTROINTESTINAL:  At the time of transfer, the patient
was noted to have resolving pancreatitis and cholangitis with
normalizing laboratory values.  He was tolerating a clear
diet which was advanced until the time of discharge to a
soft-solid diet without further nausea, vomiting, or
abdominal pain.

As mentioned above, the patient was to continue on a course
of ciprofloxacin at home for 10 days.

6.  ENDOCRINE:  As part of the patient's workup for atrial
fibrillation, a thyroid-stimulating hormone was checked which
was found to be elevated at 7.8.  Con
