Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1505**]
Chief Complaint:
Aortic Dissection

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 1968**] is a 35-year-old male who was transferred by med
flight from [**Hospital3 3583**] with a diagnosis of an ascending
aortic dissection. He presented to
that hospital 36 hours earlier with chest pain, shortness of
breath, was intubated and a transthoracic echo done on the
morning of transfer showed a type A dissection with wide open
aortic insufficiency. He was intubated with high oxygen
requirements of 100% FIO2 with marginal oxygen saturations. He
was emergently med flighted to the [**Hospital1 18**] for surgical
intervention.

Brief Hospital Course:
Upon arrival to the operating room directly from the heli pad,
he was found to be mottled and blue, cold and clammy. His upper
body and head in particular were very dusky suggesting SVC
compression. He had very poor pulses all over and very weak
carotid pulses on the right and an absent right upper extremity
pulse. He had an oxygen saturation in the low 90% on 100%
oxygen. Placement of a femoral line in the right femoral artery
emergently showed dark blood with a very weak pulse and his
blood pressure was about 75 mmHg. He was prepped and draped
emergently. Transesophageal echocardiogram showed a huge
ascending aorta with a tear and a dissection that extended all
the away around into the descending aorta. See operative note
for surgical details. The operation was complicated by a severe
coagulopathy and the inability to wean from cardiopulmonary
bypass. An LVAD was subsequently placed. Despite mechanical
support, he continued to require significant pressor support.
And despite multiple blood products, he continued to experience
a coagulopathy most likely secondary to shock liver. He was
eventually transferred
to the CSRU in grave condition with an Esmarch dressing in
place. The family was contact[**Name (NI) **] and told of the possibly grim
prognosis. His hemodynamics steadily worsened and he continued
to bleed. He later expired that night.
