Abdominal Pain, Nausea, Vomiting

History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 65 year-old male with gallstone pancreatitis who
presents as a transfer from an OSH for possible ERCP and
cholecystectomy.  The patient initially presented to [**Hospital 1474**]
Hospital ED on [**2121-11-15**] c/o abdominal pain x 3 days.  CT
showed cholelithiasis without pericholecystic fluid; the patient
was afebrile and without leukocytosis.  He was sent home and
scheduled for outpatient elective cholecystectomy.  Then on
[**2121-11-18**], a day prior to the scheduled elective
cholecystectomy, the patient presented to the [**Hospital 1474**] Hospital
ED with nausea, vomiting, and epigastric pain radiating to his
back.  CT was suggestive of acute pancreatitis.  He was admitted
to the [**Hospital1 1474**] MICU, where he remained  afebrile and initially
without leukocytosis. This morning the patient's WBC rose to
20.5 (from 10.9) and he was switched to Imipenem. He was
transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] ICU on [**2121-11-20**].

Per outside Hospital Report: CT [**11-19**] - Multiple gallstones, no
pericholecystic fluid, no free fluid

Radiology Report CT PELVIS W/CONTRAST Study Date of [**2121-11-30**]
2:42 PM
IMPRESSION:
1. Lack of enhancement in the pancreatic head and neck and
extensive peripancreatic fluid, in keeping with severe
pancreatitis. Interval worsening in comparison to prior CT
[**2121-11-19**].
2. The superior mesenteric vein and splenic vein are patent, but
exhibit
luminal narrowing. These vessels may therefore be compromised by
the peripancreatic inflammation.Subotimal arterial bolus makes
evaluation for arterial compromise difficult though none is
seen.
3. Complete atelectasis of the lower lobe of the left lung.
Consolidation in the basilar segments of the right lower lobe
consistent with atelectasis and possible superimposed pneumonia.

4. Moderate amount of ascites in the abdomen and pelvis.
5. Mild fullness of the collecting system of the right kidney
has developed
since the prior CT. There is no significant caliceal dilatation,
and the right ureter is not dilated.

Brief Hospital Course:
Pt was initially transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] [**2121-11-20**] for gallstone
pancreatitis, he was febrile, agitated and combative upon
arrival, his hospital course was complicated by respiratory
failure, multisystem organ failure and a prolonged ICU course.
He was discharged to ventilatory rehab on [**2121-12-10**] with a
tracheostomy. He recovered from his pancreatitis with supportive
care and agressive resussitation.
.
Neuro: Pt intubated and sedated with propofol shortly after
arrival/admission. He was empirically placed on CIWA scale and
given thiamine and folate for possible ETOH withdrawl. He was
eventually transitioned to fentanyl and versed drips. At time of
discharge pt is trached and ventilated but otherwise alert and
oriented, nodding appropriately, and not requring sedation. Pt
taking zyprexa PRN for agitation
.
Cardiovascular: Hypertensive during his hospital course
controleld with beta blockade which was tritated up as IV
lopressor while pt was NPO and hydralazine PRN.
.
Respiratory: Pt was intubated on [**12-1**] in the ICU for
respiratory failure, on [**12-1**] a bedside percutaneous
tracheostomy was placed as respiratory status was not improving
as quickly as desired. The patient was able to be weaned from
assist control with moderate ventilatory support to pressure
support at the time of discharge. Initially requiring a propofol
drip for tachypnea while on pressure support, by discharge pt
was tolerating pressure support with no sedation required.
.
GI/GU: Initially presenting with elevated transaminases,
bilirubin, amylase and lipase indicitive of obstruction and
likely gallstone pancreatitis, there were no obstruting stones
on imaging and LFTS, bilirubin, amylase and lipase all
normalized during his hospital course with supportive care. ERCP
was not preformed as LFTS and bilirubin were normalizing, as was
WBC.
.
Heme: HCT trended down during his hospital course secondary to
illness and dilution. There was no bleeding episodes during his
admission and no transfusion requirement. The pt did recieve
albumin during his ICU course for volume/colloid support
.
FEN: Very agressive fluid rehydration at time of admission given
pancreatitis, acute on chronic renal failure and tachycardia.
TPN was started for nutritional support on [**11-21**] as a prolonged
NPO course and bowel rest was anticipated. As his pain improved,
as did his nurological status - his Amylase and lipase
normalized and pt was transitioned to tube feeds via a dubbhoff
nasoenteric feeding catheter.
.
Endocrine: Regular Insulin Sliding Scale during hospital course.
He was transiently on an insulin drip whcih was transitioned to
RISS by the time of discharge.
.
Renal: Pt has a history or CRI (1.4) presented with Cr of 2.1
and muddy brown casts consistent with acute tubulat necosis.
Agressive fluid rehydration for both renal and pancreatic
issues. He was also on an HCO3 drip for his acidosis/ATN. Once
renal function normalized, he was diuresed with a lasix drip due
to massive total body water overload from his resussitation. His
creatine normalized to his baseline by time of discharge on [**12-10**].
.
ID: Initially presenting with a leukocytosis of 22.2, he trended
down and normalized to a WBC of 7.2 on the day of discharge. He
had positive blood cultures on [**11-21**] growing out coagulase
negative staff aureus. He did have persistent diarrhea during
his hospital course. Despite multiple negative c-diff assays,
the pt was placed on an empiric
