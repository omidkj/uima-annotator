History of Present Illness:
51-year-old male who
was initially seen at [**Hospital3 **] emergency department on
[**2154-7-21**] after being transferred from an outside
hospital following a motorcycle collision where he sustained
multiple facial fractures.  He was transferred to [**Hospital1 346**] for evaluation and treatment of his
facial injuries and on his arrival Oral Maxillofacial Surgery
was consulted for evaluation of the facial injuries.  At the
time, Ophthalmology was also consulted for evaluation and
found that he had elevated intraocular pressure of the right
eye for which he underwent a right lateral canthotomy with
subsequent return to normal pressure by Ophthalmology in the
emergency department.  The patient was also evaluated by
Neurosurgery at the time for evidence of CSF rhinorrhea as
well as a small area of pneumocephalus on his CAT scan.
During his admission, Ophthalmology and Neurosurgery followed
him and he was eventually cleared from Neurosurgery as his
CSF leak resolve and Ophthalmology also cleared him for
discharge and the patient was discharged.  The patient was
seen by Oral Maxillofacial Surgery as an outpatient where it
was discussed in detail, planned for reconstruction of his
right upper and mid face.  At that appointment, all risks,
benefits, alternatives, and complications were discussed with
the patient in detail including the risks of damage to his
eye, blindness and risk of opening up a CSF leak and damage
to the brain.  It was discussed with the patient that
consultation with Neurosurgery would be done preoperatively
in order to have them available if there was, in fact, dural
tear and CSF leak found during the operation.  The patient
also was seen by Ophthalmology again as an outpatient prior
to the surgery and the patient was cleared by the
Ophthalmology team for open reduction internal fixation of
his orbital and frontal sinus fractures.  Therefore, the
patient was scheduled for surgery on [**2154-7-27**].
