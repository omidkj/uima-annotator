HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 69-year-old Caucasian
male with past medical history significant for hypertension,
coronary artery disease status post multiple myocardial
infarctions and ICD placement secondary to V-fib arrest,
systolic CHF with an EF of 20%, AFib status post
cardioversion [**2200-5-15**] and currently on Coumadin, peptic
ulcer disease status post partial gastrectomy in [**2162**],
colonic polyps, and diverticuli, who now presents with a two
week history of painless hematuria followed by presyncope and
bright red blood per rectum x1 day.

The patient, as stated above, has been having two weeks of
painless hematuria prior to admission.  On the morning of
admission, he underwent an outpatient cystoscopy without any
complications, which failed to reveal any significant
findings.

About two hours after lunch, he began to feel quite
lightheaded, weak, and diaphoretic.  His symptoms were
relieved after lying down.  Soon thereafter, he had a large
loose bowel movement.  It was unclear whether there was any
bright red blood per rectum or whether the stool was
melanotic at this time.  After the bowel movement, he again
had an episode of presyncope.  At that time, his daughter
called EMS.  His blood pressure on the field was noted to be
80/42 with a pulse of 60.  He was brought to the [**Hospital1 346**] Emergency Department, where his
blood pressure was confirmed to be 85/40 with a pulse of 53.
He was given about 2 liters in the Emergency Department with
a rise in his pressure to 150/85.  Nasogastric lavage in the
ED was negative, but the patient did have three large loose
maroon guaiac positive bowel movements.  His hematocrit
dropped from 42.4 to 39.3 after both the bowel movement and
hydration.  He was thus transferred to the Medical ICU for
closer monitoring.

The patient reports that his last episode of bright red blood
per rectum was in [**2162**].  He denied any foreign travel, sick
contacts, unusual foods, chest pain, shortness of breath,
abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, palpitations.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. CAD status post anterior wall MI in [**2188**], status post
PTCA/stent of LAD with restenosis leading to a repeat PTCA in
[**2197**].
2. Persantine thallium test in [**2199-5-15**] negative for
ischemia, but revealed an EF of 20%.
3. V-fib arrest [**2198-4-15**] leading to placement of an
AICD.
4. Pneumococcal pneumonia and respiratory failure.
5. Duodenal ulcer status post partial gastrectomy in [**2162**]
complicated by splenic injury leading to a splenectomy at
that time.
6. Hypertension.
7. Hypercholesterolemia.
8. Prostate cancer.
9. Atrial fibrillation on Coumadin since [**2198-4-15**].

ALLERGIES:  Penicillin which results in a rash.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Father died of prostate cancer.  Son died of
melanoma.  Uncle had a MI in his 60s.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives with his daughter.  [**Name (NI) **]
quit tobacco in [**2162**].  He drinks about one drink every two
weeks.  He is a funeral home director and denies any IV drug
use.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 97.7, blood pressure
128/64, pulse 58, respirations 16, and sating 100% on room
air.  In general, this is a well-developed, well-nourished,
and well-appearing pleasant gentleman, who is alert and
oriented times three and appeared to be in no apparent
distress.  Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light.
Mucous membranes were dry.  Neck was without any jugular
venous pressure or lymphadenopathy.  Lungs were clear.
Cardiovascular revealed normal S1, S2 without any murmurs,
rubs, or gallops.  Abdomen was obese, but soft.  There was
mild right lower quadrant tenderness to palpation, but no
rebound or guarding.  Bowel sounds were normal.  There was a
well-healed surgical scar in the midline.  There is no
hepatosplenomegaly or palpable masses.  Extremities were warm
with 2+ pulses, no edema.  Neurologic was nonfocal,
symmetric, and the patient displayed appropriate mentation.

LABORATORIES ON ADMISSION:  Notable for a white count of
16.8, hematocrit 39.3, platelets of 323.  Differential of 65
polys, 28 lymphocytes, 5 monocytes, INR of 2.5.  Creatinine
1.4 up from a baseline of 1.1.  BUN 31.  Urinalysis showed 30
protein, greater than 50 red cells, [**3-19**] white cells, and
occasional bacteria.

EKG showed sinus bradycardia at 54, left axis deviation, old
Q's in the inferior leads, and poor R-wave progression, old
T-wave inversions in lateral and precordial leads.  Prolonged
QTc interval at 510, but no acute ST changes.

HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEMS:  [**Name2 (NI) **] gastrointestinal bleed:
The patient's lower GI bleed was most likely thought to be
due to the patient's known diverticuli in the setting of
anticoagulation on Coumadin.  Two large bore IVs were placed
at all times, and the patient was placed on telemetry.  His
hematocrits were checked on a q.4. basis initially until they
were deemed to be stable.  The patient did not require any
blood transfusions during his hospital stay.

He was placed on IV Protonix b.i.d. for adequate prophylaxis.
He was initially kept NPO and given maintenance IV hydration.
His Coumadin and aspirin were both held for about 24 hours.
The GI team was consulted, but it was felt that there was no
role for either any further imaging at this time.  After
about 24 hours, the patient stopped having any further bloody
bowel movements.  At that time, his diet was slowly advanced
and well tolerated.

Hypotension:  The patient had transient hypotension with a
systolic pressure in the 80s on initial presentation likely
secondary to decreased intervascular volume in the setting of
diarrhea.  After about 2 liters of normal saline, the
patient's blood pressure returned back to his baseline and he
remained hemodynamically stable thereafter.  His atenolol and
lisinopril were changed to shorter acting metoprolol and
captopril while he was in-house.  His Lasix was held for one
day as well.

Leukocytosis:  Patient presented with a white count of 16.8
with no left shift.  Clostridium difficile toxin, blood
cultures, urine cultures, and chest x-ray were all
unremarkable.  The patient remained afebrile throughout his
hospital stay.  His white count at the time of discharge was
still elevated at 12 with no clear etiology.

Coronary artery disease:  The patient was continued on his
statin, beta blocker, and ACE inhibitor.  His aspirin was
placed on hold transiently.  It was decided not to reverse
his INR as the patient is at high risk for thromboembolic
disease.

Atrial fibrillation:  Even though the patient has a history
of AFib, he remained in sinus bradycardia throughout this
hospital stay.  His amiodarone was continued.  Given the
patient's history of recurrent instent restenosis while off
Coumadin, it was decided to restart his Coumadin on hospital
day #2 with a goal to keep his INR between 1.7 and 2.  It was
also decided to start him on a baby aspirin instead of a full
dosed aspirin.

Acute renal failure:  Patient's initial creatinine at the
time of this presentation was 1.4, elevated from his baseline
of 1.1, which is thought to be secondary to prerenal azotemia
in the setting of diarrhea.  After gentle hydration, the
patient's creatinine returned to [**Location 213**] range.  At the time
of discharge, it had recovered to 0.9.

CHF:  The patient's weight was checked daily and remained
stable for the most part.  He had no signs or symptoms of
hypoxia or fluid overload.  His outpatient Lasix was resumed
on hospital day #3.

Hematuria:  The patient underwent an abdominopelvic CT
immediately prior to discharge, which revealed a 1 x 0.6 cm
stone in the left ureteropelvic junction.  There was no
evidence of hydronephrosis visualized.  As a result, the
patient will be scheduled for an outpat
