CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Acute renal failure.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 59-year-old man with a
history of diabetes, atrial fibrillation, chronic renal
insufficiency, congestive heart failure, status post left TKR
on [**2116-7-23**], discharged on [**8-6**], from [**Hospital6 1760**], after a prolonged hospital
course.  The last hospital course was significant for
hypotension requiring pressors and a five-day in the SICU, as
well as atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate,
managed with Esmolol drip, Lopressor, Digoxin, Amiodarone,
and Coumadin.  The patient also was in congestive heart
failure and managed with Lasix, Zaroxolyn, Dobutamine, and
Natrecor.  The patient ruled out for myocardial infarction.
He was then discharged to [**Hospital **] Rehabilitation on
[**2116-8-6**], and had been doing well.

The patient was doing well at [**Hospital1 **] until [**8-26**], at
which time the patient's speech was noted to be slurred, and
the patient felt like he was not thinking clearly.  He called
his healthcare proxy, [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) **], and after conversation
with [**Hospital1 **] staff, the patient was sent to the [**Hospital6 1760**] Emergency Department.  The
patient believed that, "I think I had a stroke."

In the Emergency Department, the patient was found to have a
BUN and creatinine of 166/6.8, phosphorus 15, potassium 5.2.
A Foley was placed revealing 1200 cc of urine.  Head CT
demonstrated right-sided vasogenic edema not consistent with
a bleed.  He was started on intravenous fluids and Levaquin.
He was noted to be apneic for ten-second pauses.  ABG values
were 7.21, 48, 117.

The patient also reported a significant cough with brown,
thick sputum for several days.  He also had one episode of
vomiting.

The patient was transferred to the MICU for evaluation.

eight years.  He quit in [**2089**].  He drinks rare alcohol.  He
is a former architect with education at [**University/College **] and
[**Doctor Last Name **].  He is currently disabled secondary to
heart condition.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs:  97.5??????, 64, 117/79, 16,
97% on room air.  General:  The patient was somnolent,
arousable to voice, but appropriate when awake.  HEENT:
Normocephalic, atraumatic.  Pupils equal, round and reactive
to light.  Oropharynx clear.  Dry mucous membranes.  No
icterus.  Neck:  No Kussmaul.  No jugular venous distention.
Lungs:  Decreased breath sounds of the right lower lobe.
Cardiovascular:  Irregular rate and rhythm.  Normal S1 and
S2.  Positive rub.  Abdomen:  Soft, nontender, nondistended.
Decreased bowel sounds.  Extremities:  Bilateral
hyperpigmented lower extremities.  Left knee scar, clean,
dry, and intact.  There was 1+ lower extremity edema
bilaterally.  Neurological:  The patient was somnolent.  He
opened eyes briefly on command.  He moved all extremities
spontaneously.  He had positive intermittent upper extremity
twitching.

LABORATORY DATA:  White count 10.9, hematocrit 32.2; sodium
125, potassium 5.2, chloride 84, bicarb 17, BUN 166,
creatinine 6.8, glucose 127, phosphorus 15.5, amylase 108, LD
534, lipase 86; urinalysis with trace protein; urine culture
positive for enterococcus urinary tract infection.

Head CT without contrast with negative bleed, question of
vasogenic edema in the right frontal lobe.

Chest x-ray with stable cardiomegaly, increased right-sided
hemidiaphragm with adjacent atelectasis versus pneumonia.

Electrocardiogram with atrial fibrillation at 70 beats per
minute, no Qs, old diffuse T-wave flattening in the limb
leads, 0.[**Street Address(2) 1755**] depressions in II, III, and AVF.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  1.  Renal:  The patient was admitted with
the diagnosis of acute renal failure.  This was thought
secondary to 1) prerenal state from overdiuresis, as well as
interstitial nephritis secondary to excessive NSAID, 2)
urinary retention secondary to narcotic use for pain.  The
patient was admitted with uremia.

The patient's ACE inhibitor and Vioxx were held.  The patient
was also started on Amphojel 30 cc t.i.d.  The patient
received gentle diuresis for his prerenal state.  He had a
Foley placed for urinary retention with improvement of his
creatinine down to 1.7.

The patient was transferred to the floor.  Initially the
patient's creatinine remained stable, and the Foley was
removed.  Following Foley removal, the patient's creatinine
slowly climbed to 2.8.  At that time, the Foley was placed
with an output of 850 cc of urine indicating additional
urinary retention.  He also had a ................ which was
25%.  Again the patient was prerenal.  The patient had the
Foley maintained and gentle intravenous fluids with decrease
in the patient's creatinine.  At the time of this dictation,
the creatinine is 2.3 and trending downward.  The patient
should have his Foley left until he is off narcotics
completely, at which time the Foley can be removed, and she
be followed for signs of urinary retention.

2.  Infectious disease:  MRSA bronchitis:  The patient was
admitted with a cough with rust-colored sputum.  Chest x-ray
revealed small right lower lobe infiltrate unlikely to be
pneumonia.  The patient had sputum cultures done which
demonstrated MRSA.  He was started on Vancomycin 1 g, renal
based, first.  The patient's sputum cleared up after several
days.  He completed a 14-day course of Vancomycin.

Mastoiditis:  The patient is with long-standing OM with
perforated left tympanic membranes.  The patient has been on
Cortisporin drops in the past.  The patient had evidence of
mastoiditis on CT scan but did not have other symptoms.  The
patient was treated with 14 days of CMK drops without
systemic antibiotics.  The patient had no residual ear
drainage at discharge.

Parotitis:  The patient was diagnosed with left parotitis on
the 19th by the ENT Service.  The patient was started on
[**Doctor Last Name **] juice to enhance salivation.  He also had hot packs and
parotid massage.  Over time, the patient's right parotitis
improved slowly and is no longer tender, however, remained
slightly swollen.  Two days prior to discharge, the patient
had mild swelling of his left parotid gland.  The patient was
continued on the same treatment.  He is in no additional pain
at this time.  He is to continue the [**Doctor Last Name **] juice and massage,
as well as the hot packs.  He should follow-up with ENT in
the future.

Urinary tract infection:  The patient was admitted and had
the diagnosis of enterococcus urinary tract infection.  This
was sensitive to Vancomycin.  The patient was receiving this
for his MRSA bronchitis.  The patient had repeat urinalysis
midway through his course which was negative for urinary
tract infection.

Question of bacteremia:  The patient had one of four blood
cultures demonstrating MRSA; however, follow-up cultures were
negative.  This was felt to be likely from skin
contamination.  He remained afebrile following initiation of
antibiotics.

3.  Neurologic:  The patient's mental status originally was
thought to be toxic metabolic encephalopathy secondary to the
uremia.  Following the decrease in the patien
