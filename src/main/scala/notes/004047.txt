Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Sulfa (Sulfonamides) / Iodine / B12/E,B6-Fa(<1mg)/Mn/Dietary 1

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 11495**]
Chief Complaint:
acute shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
cardiac catheterization [**7-10**] with stent and IABP placement,
central line placement


History of Present Illness:
83 y/o Jehovah's witness with PMH significant for Colon CA,
DMII, CAD (MI in past, refused angioplasty), living at Sunrise
Senior Living Center, was found to be acutely SOB.  EMS found pt
in severe respiratory distress.  No chest pain.  RR 32 BP:
130/palp.  Able to answer questions but responded with one word
answers b/c so SOB.  Put on non-rebreather, sent to [**Hospital3 1280**]
Hospital.  On arrival, BP 152/92 HR 120-130 Afib-Asystole with
agonal respirations.  Intubated and responded to atropine, with
a HR of 77 with pulse (afib) BP 167/145 then went into SVT to
185.  She was given IV lasix, IV nitro gtt, ASA, Lopressor 5mg
IV, and a heparin drip.  Sent to ICU and found to have ST
elevation in aVR with depressions in V2-V4 and II, III, and aVF,
concerning for right posterior MI.  Initially, the pt was in
rate-controlled Atrial fibrillation, but developed CHF-- a
dobutamine gtt was started and she was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for
cardiac catheterization.  She was given solumedrol, benadryl,
and pepcid for allergy ppx, in cath lab, stented left circumflex
artery (occl) with BP drop to 60 systolic upon stenting (good
flow)--- changed to dopamine gtt.  Stented right coronary
artery, and started intra-aortic balloon pump.  She was
subsequently transferred to the coronary care unit on IV
dopamine at 10 mcg/kg/min.  No GP IIa/IIIb inhibitors started.
Of note, she is a Jehovah's witness (with form for no
transfusions to be given in the chart).  Her HCP is [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) 10076**]
([**Telephone/Fax (1) 107105**].  Her labs at [**Hospital1 **] were CK 99, Trop I 2.01
(M 0-0.34), BNP 407.

Past Medical History:
1.  Colon ca- recently had abd surgery, found recurrence, but pt
refused additional sx or chemo
2.  DM type II
3.  CAD (s/p prior MI, with refusal of angioplasty)
4.  Brain tumor- s/p resection (distant past)
5.  Alzheimer's demetia
6.  Anxiety
7.  Hypothyroidism
8.  Seizure d/o
9.  Depression
10. Hypercholesterolemia


Social History:
Unknown smoking history, alcohol.  Jehovah's witness.  Lives at
[**Hospital3 **].  No known family members.  HCP are both members
of her [**Name (NI) 16042**] witness community.

Family History:
Non contributory.

Pertinent Results:
Cardiac Catheterization [**2140-7-10**]:  Elevated L and R filling
pressures.  PCWP 33.  Nl LMA.  LAD occluded proximally with
distal collaterals from RCA (right-dominant).
CO: 6.06, CI 3.21
PCW: (M/A/V) 33/36/43
RA: (M/A/V) 19/20/26
AO: (S/D/M) 99/53/61
PA: (S/D/M) 61/33/45
RV: (S/D/E) [**2096-11-4**]
LMCA: nl
LAD: proximally occluded, filling via left and RCA collaterals
showing severe diffuse ds
LCX: occluded after OM1
RCA: 80% mid lesion; 50% origin posterolateral branch
COMMENTS:
  1. Selective coronary angiography showed a right dimonant
system with
severe three vessel disease. The LMCA was angiographically
without
significant disease. The LAD was proximally occluded and was
filled by
left-to-left and right-to-left collaterals. The mid and distal
LAD was
severely diffusely diseased. The proximal LCX was without flow
limiting
stenoses and filled a moderate sized OM1. The mid LCX was
occluded prior
to a large OM2. The RCA was a large dominant vessel with a mid
80%
stenosis and a 50% stenosis at the origin of the PL branch.
There was a
considerable amount of right to left collaterals to the LAD.
  2. Limited hemodynamics showed severe pulmonary hypertension
(PA mean
47 mmHg). The left and right sided filling presures were
severely
elevated (RA mean 20 mmhg, RVEDP 19 mmHg, PCW mean 37 mmHg). The
cardiac
output was normal with low systemic resistance (CO 6.2 l/min, CI
3.3
l/min/m2).
  3. Successful PTCA and stenting of the RCA with a 2.5 x 18 mm
Cypher
DES. Final angiography revealed no residual stenosis, no
apparent
dissection, and normal epicardial flow (see PTCA comments).
  4. Successful PTCA and stenting of the RCA with a 3.0 x 13 mm
Cypher
DES. FInal angiography revealed no residual stenosis, no
apparent
dissection, and normal epicardial flow (see PTCA comments).
  5. Successful insertion and timing of a 30 cc intraaortic
balloon
pump.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Severe elevation of left and right sided pressures
3. Moderately severe pulmonary hypertension.
4. Acute inferolateral myocardial infarction with cardiogenic
shock
managed by PTCA and placement of drug-eluting stents in the mid
LCX and
mid RCA.
5. Successful insertion of an intraaortic balloon pump.
.
Arrived in cath lab with SBP 100 on 15mcg dobutamine.  LCX
occlusion crossed and dilated and stented Cypher with no
residual, nl flow.  60% prox M1 ds with moderate distal LCX ds,
after LCX PCI, SBP decr to 60.  IABP inserted via LFA and
dobutamine changed to dopamine with return of SBP to 100.  RCA
lesion dilated, Cypher stent with no residual, normal flow.

Echocardiogram [**2140-7-11**]
Conclusions:
The left atrium is elongated. There is moderate symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is
unusually small with near cavit obliteration during systole.
Overall left ventricular ejection fraction is normal to
hyperdynamic (EF 65-75%, Inotropes?) with basal to mid
infero-lateral wall hypokinesis. No masses or thrombi are seen
in the left ventricle. Right ventricular chamber size and free
wall motion are normal. The aortic root is mildly dilated. The
ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Trace
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is a small pericardial effusion.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.

      STAPH AUREUS COAG +.    RARE GROWTH.
         Staphylococcus species may develop resistance during
prolonged
         therapy with quinolones.   Therefore, isolates that are
initially
         susceptible may become resistant within three to four
days after
         initiation of therapy.  Testing of repeat isolates may
be
         warranted.
