Chest pain with exertion

History of Present Illness:
81 y/o spanish-speaking woman with Diabetes Mellitus, class I
chronic diastolic Congestive Heart Failure, Chronic Kidney
Disease, Hypertension, hyperlipidemia presents with chest pain
and shortness of breath.

Of note, the patient was recently seen by her PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**2-21**] with
the complaint of right sided chest pressure and shortness of
breath, worsened by exertion.  An EKG performed in the office
showed TWI in leads V1-V4, and an outpatient stress test was
ordered.

The patient states that she has been having tightness and
pressure in her chest that has been present for the last 2
weeks.  She states that since her visit to her PCP that her
symptoms have become progressively worse with exertion, to the
point that she develops symptoms while getting up to go to the
bathroom.  She admits that she feels fatigued throughout the
day, which is worse from her baseline.  She stated that last
night she became markedly dyspneic while getting up to go to the
bathroom, with associated R chest pressure which migrated to the
substernal region.  Her daughter was concerned about this
development and decided to bring the patient into the emergency
department.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,
ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.  She was
admitted for further evaluation.

[**2102-3-9**] at 9:52:03 AM      FINAL
GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify I was present in compliance with HCFA
regulations. The patient was under general anesthesia throughout
the procedure. The TEE probe was passed with assistance from the
anesthesioology staff using a laryngoscope. No TEE related
complications.
Conclusions
Pre-CPB:
No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the left atrial
appendage.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed
(LVEF= 40 - 45 %). with mild global free wall hypokinesis. The
apex is hypokinetic, while base and mid segments all work well.
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. No aortic
regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are moderately thickened. Moderate
(2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.

Post-CPB:
The patient is AV-Paced, on no inotropes.
Preserved biventricular systolic fxn.
No AI.
MR is now mild.
Aorta intact.
SGC tip is at the PA bifurcation.
  I certify that I was present for this procedure in compliance
with HCFA regulations.

Brief Hospital Course:
On [**3-9**] Ms.[**Known lastname 3234**] was taken to the operating room and underwent
Coronary bypass grafting x4 (left->internal mammary artery to
the left anterior descending
artery and reverse saphenous vein graft to the posterior
descending artery, distal left circumflex artery and obtuse
marginal artery) with Dr.[**Last Name (STitle) **]. Please refer to operative report
for further surgical details. CROSS-CLAMP TIME:74 minutes. PUMP
TIME:89 minutes.

She tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to the
CVICU in stable but critical condition, intubated and sedated.
She remained intubated with progressive oliguric renal failure
and subsequent volume overload. Renal consulted and CVVH was
initiated. Fluid was removed and on POD# 6 she was extubated
without difficulty. CVVH was discontinued.  Renal advised no
further lasix.

The following day she demonstrated markedly diminished mental
status and a head CT scan per Radiology revealed scattered
hypodense foci in the right frontal lobe and left frontal and
temporal lobes are indeterminate but may represent small vessel
ischemic changes/volume averaging.

Ultimately her mental status improved, her urine output was
adequate with resolving postoperative ARF. She continued to
slowly progress and on POD# 12 she was transferred to the step
down unit for further monitoring. Physical Therapy was consulted
for evaluation of strength and mobility.

The remainder of her hospital course was essentially uneventful.
On POD19 she was cleared for discharge to [**Hospital 100**] Rehab.  All
follow up appointments were advised.  Electrolytes will be
checked frequently at rehab.
