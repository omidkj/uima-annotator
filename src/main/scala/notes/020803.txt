Chief Complaint:
AORTIC STENOSIS

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2141-3-20**] - Aortic valve replacement(19-mm Biocor tissue valve)


History of Present Illness:
This 89 year old woman with severe diastolic
dysfunction,critical calcific aortic stenosis and severe
pulmonary hypertension and has had numerous hospitalizations for
acutely decompensated heart failure over the last few years. Her
most recent admission was [**Date range (3) 24942**].

She has shortness of breath that occurs when she exerts herself
and when she is emotionally stressed. She can walk 10 feet
before needing to rest due to shortness of breath. She
occasionally has chest pain in the setting emotional distress.
She reports having some dizziness when she changes position
quickly or after ambulation. She was undergoing consideration
for Corevalve protocol vs surgical AVR. Under this study, she
was randomized to surgical intervention and was admitted for
same day surgery.

Pertinent Results:
ECHO [**2141-3-20**]
PRE BYPASS The left atrium is dilated. Mild spontaneous echo
contrast is seen in the body of the left atrium. Moderate to
severe spontaneous echo contrast is present in the left atrial
appendage. The left atrial appendage emptying velocity is
depressed (<0.2m/s). A left atrial appendage thrombus cannot be
completely excluded. The right atrium is dilated. No thrombus is
seen in the right atrial appendage A patent foramen ovale is
present. A left-to-right shunt across the interatrial septum is
seen at rest. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal.
Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). [Intrinsic
left ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed
given the severity of valvular regurgitation.] The right
ventricle displays normal free wall contractility. [Intrinsic
right ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed
given the severity of tricuspid regurgitation.] There are simple
atheroma in the ascending aorta. There are complex (>4mm)
atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. The aortic valve
leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. There is critical
aortic valve stenosis (valve area <0.8cm2). Trace aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are moderately
thickened. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The left
ventricular inflow pattern suggests a restrictive filling
abnormality, with elevated left atrial pressure. Moderate [2+]
tricuspid regurgitation is seen. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in
person of the results in the operating room at the time of the
study.
POST BYPASS The patient is AV paced. There is normal
biventricular systolic function. There is a bioprosthesis
located in the aortic position. It appears well seated. The
leaflets are not well seen. The maximum pressure through the
aortic valve was 28 mmHg with a mean pressure of 14 mmHg at a
cardiac output of about 3.5 liters/minute. The effective orifice
area is in the range of 0.8 to 1 cm2. The rest of the cardiac
valves appear unchanged from pre-bypass. The thoracic aorta is
intact after decannulation. Left to right shunt flow persists
through the patent foramen ovale.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 24834**] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2141-3-20**] for surgical
management of her aortic valve disease. She was taken to the
Operating Room where she underwent  aortic valve replacement
using a 19-mm Biocor tissue valve. Please see operative note for
details. Cardiopulmonary Bypass time= 53 minutes. Cross clamp
time=40 minutes. Postoperatively she was taken to the intensive
care unit for monitoring. She awoke neurologically intact, was
weaned from the ventilator and extubated on the day of surgery.
Her chest tubes and epicardial pacing wires were  removed per
cardiac surgery protocol.  Amiodarone was resumed for paroxysmal
atrial fibrillation, and was stopped when LFTs became elevated.
Coumadin was not started  due to a history of GI bleed.  She
transfered to the floor on POD2 where she was diuresed towards
her preoperative weight.  On POD 3 she developed severe
shortness of breath and was transferred back to the ICU where
for additional pulmonary support.  BiPAP was used and a right
thoracentesis was performed.  She gradually improved and on POD
10 she returned to the step down floor.  She was evaluated by
Physical Therapy for mobility and screened for rehabilitation
placement. A CXR on [**4-1**] showed a large right sided pleural
effusion.  She had another thoracentesis which yielded 350cc
serosanguinous fluid.  She developed a contraction alkalosis.
Lasix was stopped and she began Diamox.  She continued to be
diuresed and developed acute on chronic renal failure. Increased
somnolence along with a reaccumulation of her bilat effusions
resulted in yet another transfer back to the CVICU where she was
reintubated. A PA catheter was placed, a chest tube was placed
to drain the effusion and she was seen by the renal service to
assist with ongoing diuresis. She was noted to have a UTI and
appropriate antibiotics were initiated. The patient was also
seen by the heart failure service. Her renal function gradually
improved and she continued to diurese. Her chest tube continued
to drain serous fluid and thoracic surgery was consulted for
possible pleuradesis.
On POD# 28 she was again transferred to the step down floor.
