HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  A 24-year-old male with type 1
diabetes complicated by neuropathy, retinopathy, and end-
stage renal disease currently on peritoneal dialysis,
systolic CHF with an ejection fraction of 15 percent as of
[**2155-12-1**], hypertension, grade 2 esophagitis and
multiple admissions for diabetic ketoacidosis in the past,
was admitted with diabetic ketoacidosis.  Prior to admission,
the patient had three days of nausea, vomiting, and abdominal
pain.  He stated that it felt the same as his usual diabetic
ketoacidosis.  He denied fever, chills, urinary frequency,
dysuria, back pain, change in medications, chest pain, or
decreased p.o. intake.  He complained of abdominal pain and
chronic loose stools.

In addition, he says that his right lower extremity had been
slightly warm and swollen for about one week.  Prior to
coming to the Emergency Department, the patient received 12
units of Humalog.

nephropathy, diabetic neuropathy, and end-stage renal
disease.  Frequent diabetic ketoacidosis admissions.  Patient
states that he goes to [**Last Name (un) **] Diabetes Center twice a year,
and besides that, does not check his fingersticks.

Nephrotic syndrome leading to end-stage renal disease.  He is
currently on peritoneal dialysis twice a day.

Refractory hypertension on multiple blood pressure
medications as outpatient.

ALLERGIES:  Zestril makes patient feel lightheaded.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Sister has diabetes.  Mother has diabetes
status post CABG on peritoneal dialysis, father with
hypothyroidism.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Patient does not work.  He smokes
approximately 1.5 pack a day as well as marijuana.  He has
occasional alcohol use.  He spends his day sleeping in bed.
Patient does not appear to be proactive in his care.

In the Emergency Department, the patient's blood pressure was
209/123, pulse 98, respirating 18, and 95 percent on a
nonrebreather.  In the Emergency Department, the patient's
glucose is 611 with an anion gap of 22.  His cardiac enzymes
are elevated with a CPK of 440 and a troponin-T of 0.51.  In
addition, he had increased LFTs with an ALT of 899 and AST of
1650.  He was given 10 units of regular insulin, 20 mg IV
labetalol, 4 mg of IV Zofran, 80 mg IV Lasix, hydralazine 10
mg IV twice, Morphine 2 mg IV once, 2 liters of IV fluids,
and placed on a nitroglycerin drip and an insulin drip.
Patient had episodes of coffee-ground emesis, but did not
permit nasogastric tube lavage.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Physical exam as per MICU admitting
team:  Temperature 97.6, pulse of 98, blood pressure 155/108,
respiratory rate of 102, and 100 percent on nonrebreather.
Examination is significant for young thin white male, who
appears anxious with moderate respiratory distress.  HEENT:
Neck is supple, dry mucous membranes.  Oral cavity has brown
emesis particles, EOMI, pupils round and reactive with A-V
nicking in the left fundus.  Cardiovascular:  Normal S1, loud
S2, regular rate, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops.  Pulmonary:
Clear to auscultation without rales or wheezes.  Abdomen is
soft, but slightly distended with well-healed scars.  PD
catheter site nonerythematous with no exudate.  Extremities:
2 plus pitting edema bilaterally.  Neurologic is alert and
oriented times three, appropriate and responsive.

LABORATORIES:  White count 11, hematocrit 35.2, platelets
514, neutrophils 83.  K 4.4, creatinine 9.5, BUN 55, anion
gap 22.  Normal amylase, lipase, and alkaline phosphatase.
Total bilirubin slightly elevated at 0.6.  INR 1.6.

X-RAY:  Chest x-ray with stable cardiomegaly, normal
pulmonary vasculature with no pneumonia or fluid overload.

EKG:  Normal sinus rhythm at 100 beats per minute with normal
axis, old Q waves in III, left ventricular hypertrophy, old
ST elevations in V2 and V3.  New T-wave inversions in V5 with
ST depression less than 1 mm, slight decrease in previous T-
wave inversion in V6, pseudonormalization of T-wave inversion
in I and V6.

Right upper quadrant ultrasound showed patent vessels, small
amount of free intraperitoneal fluid, prominent gallbladder
filled with sludge without evidence of cholecystitis and a
right sided pleural effusion.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  A 24-year-old white male with poorly
controlled type 1 diabetes complicated by end-stage renal
disease on peritoneal dialysis, who was admitted with
diabetic cardiomyopathy and found to have an upper GI bleed,
transaminitis, malignant hypertension, and demand ischemia.

Hypoxia:  In the Emergency Department, the patient received 2
liters of IV fluids.  Although initial chest x-ray did not
reveal CHF, it is likely that patient developed CHF in the
setting of his lower ejection fraction of 15 percent.  On
admission to the floor, he was on nonrebreather, and this was
quickly titrated off as the patient was diuresed.  Patient
was on room air prior to discharge.

Transaminitis:  It is unclear of why the patient had elevated
amylase and lipase on admission.  It may be secondary to
hepatic congestion from CHF.  Hepatic serologies were
negative except for a positive hepatitis A antibody.  These
were monitored during his hospitalization and trended
downwards prior to discharge.  In addition, once diabetic
ketoacidosis resolved, the patient did not have further
abdominal pain.

Diabetes type 1:  Patient's serum glucose levels were
extremely erratic during his hospitalization.  [**Last Name (un) **]
Diabetes Center was consulted.  Initially, his Lantus was
decreased, but prior to discharge, he was increased to
slightly greater than his normal dose to a dose of 20 units
q.h.s. prior to discharge.  In addition, his Humalog sliding
scale was altered.  Upon discharge, he continued to have
erratic control of his glucose levels with episodes of
hypoglycemia and critically high levels.  Patient declined
multiple blood draws, but a few days prior to discharge, his
anion gap was within the normal range.  His anion gap had
closed prior to him being transferred out of the ICU, and was
normal upon discharge.

Hypoglycemia:  The patient had an episode of hypoglycemia, at
which time his fingersticks were in the 40s.  He was
symptomatic with blurry vision.  Patient would not
participate in his treatment and would not drink juice
despite multiple types of juice being brought to him.
Initially the fear was giving him IV repletion may increase
his chances redeveloping his diabetic ketoacidosis.  However,
IV treatment was needed and he received 1.5 amp of D50 with
resolution of his symptoms and normalization of his serum
glucose.

ID:  On admission, the patient had a questionable opacity on
his right lower lobe on chest x-ray, however, this was a
limited exam because it was a portable.  Multiple A-P views
did not reveal any infiltrate.  The patient remained afebrile
until a few days prior to discharge at which time his white
blood cell count slightly increased and he had temperatures
greater than 101.5.  There were three  sets of blood cultures
that are pending upon discharge.  Patient declined multiple
blood draws for cultures.  A urine culture was negative with
less than 10,000 CFUs.  A peritoneal dialysate fluid showed 1
white bl
