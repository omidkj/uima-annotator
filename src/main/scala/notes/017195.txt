CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2133-4-27**] 12:01 PM

HEAD CT WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: There is no hemorrhage, edema, mass
effect, or
shift of normally midline structures. Prominence of the
ventricles and sulci
is related to age-appropriate parenchymal atrophy.
Periventricular
hypodensities consistent with chronic small vessel ischemic
disease. Vascular
cacifications of the carotid arteries are identifed. The
visualized paranasal
sinuses and mastoid air cells are clear. No fracture is
identified.

IMPRESSION: No fracture or hemorrhage.



[**2133-5-5**] SCHED
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)


INDICATION: Left-sided chest tube removal, evaluate for
pneumothorax.

FINDINGS: AP single view of the chest obtained with patient in
sitting
semi-upright position is analyzed in direct comparison with a
preceding
similar study obtained approximately six hours earlier during
the same date.
During the interval, the left-sided basal pleural chest tube has
been removed.
No pneumothorax has developed. Lung findings are unchanged and
without
evidence of new infiltrates.

IMPRESSION: No evidence of pneumothorax after left-sided chest
tube removal.




CT CHEST W/CONTRAST Study Date of [**2133-4-27**] 1:09 PM

CT CHEST: A 15.5 x 10.6 x 5.3 cm extrapleural ovoid hematoma is
noted
indenting the posterolateral aspect of the left lung (2:47).
There is
hematoma also noted in the adjacent left posterolateral left
chest wall
(please see below for full description of left posterior rib
fractures). There
is no pooling of contrast on delayed images to suggest active
bleeding. There
is a moderate to large left pleural effusion which is of
intermediate density
and somewhat loculated which likely reflects hemothorax. There
is left sided
compressive atelectasis.

The right lung demonstrates minimal subsegmental atelectasis.
The aorta
contains atherosclerotic calcifications. There are also
extensive coronary
artery calcifications. The heart and mediastinal structures are
mildly
shifted to the right. There is no mediastinal hematoma ot
evidence of great
vessel injury. A left brachiocephalic vein stent is again noted.


There is no evidence of splenic laceration or other solid organ
injury. The
kidneys are atrophic bilaterally. The left kidney contains
several calculi
measuring up to 9- mm. Additional punctate right renal calculi
are noted.
There is extensive bilateral renal arterial atherosclerotic
calcification. No
intra- abdominal free fluid is identified. There is no evidence
of
diaphragmatic rupture. Please note, there is chronic elevation
of the left
hemidiaphragm.

OSSEOUS STRUCTURES: There are multiple rib fractures involving
the left fourth
through ninth ribs posteriorly. The fourth rib is fractured at
the
costovertebral junction (2:23). Segmental fractures of the 5th,
6th, and 7th
ribs are noted with fractures at the costovertebral margin and
along the
posterior arch. The eighth and ninth posterior ribs are
fractured along the
posterior arch only (2:39 and 2:46). There is displacement of
the posterior
arch fractures at 7 through 9, with elements of comminution. The
clavicles and
scapulae appear are intact. The thoracic and upper lumbar
vertebrae maintain
normal alignment and appear intact. Degenerative changes are
noted in the
spine.

IMPRESSION:
1. Large extrapleural hematoma along the left lateral lung and
left chest
wall hematoma. No evidence of active bleeding. Multiple left
posterior rib
fractures described in detail above involving the left 4th
through 9th ribs.
2. Large left hemothorax with a compressive atelectasis. Mild
mediastinal
shift to the right.
3. No evidence of splenic injury or diaphragmatic rupture.
Elevation of left
hemidiaphragm is a chronic finding as seen on multiple prior
chest radiographs
dating back to [**2130-5-9**].







Brief Hospital Course:
He was admitted to the Trauma service. A left thoracostomy was
performed and he was given 2 units fresh frozen plasma in the
emergency room. Once stabilized he was then transferred to the
Trauma ICU. The Acute Pain service was consulted given his
multiple rib fractures; he was placed on Morphine PCA initially
and was later changed to MS Contin. The MS Contin was stopped
and he was placed on Oxycodone prn which is offering him
adequate relief at this point.

Nephrology was also consulted early on because of his ESRD and
history of receiving hemodialysis three times per week. He did
receive his hemodialysis throughout his stay here.

Thoracics was also consulted for the extrapleural hematoma. he
was taken to the operating room on [**5-2**] for evacuation of this
and a VATS procedure. His chest tubes were removed several days
later.

Physical and Occupational therapy were consulted early during
his stay and have recommended rehab after acute hospital stay.
