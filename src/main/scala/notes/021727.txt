Allergies:
No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions

Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 13159**]
Chief Complaint:
Anemia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
This is an 80y/o Male with a history of [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2091**], CAD s/p [**Name (NI) 7792**]
(unclear if intervented upon), CVA, dementia who presents with
low Hct. Of note patient is a poor historian and is unable to
confirm information.

On follow up labs for known anemia on [**7-15**], patient was found to
have Hct of 21 down from 28 on [**7-1**]. Per report, patient did not
have any abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, tarry or bloody
stools. He was then sent to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation.

On arrival to ED, initial VS were: 98 66 117/52 20 100%RA.
Evaluation was significant for melena on rectial exam. Hct was
21. Patient was ordered for 2 units pRBCs however did not
receive any units. He was started on protonix gtt and was
admitted to MICU. Prior to transfer GI was consulted who planned
to scope in AM. Patient remained hemodynamically stable however
given concern for upper GI bleed, patient was admitted to MICU.

ECG [**2109-7-19**]:
Sinus rhythm with premature ventricular complex. Borderline Q-T
interval
prolongation. Extensive ST-T wave changes in the inferolateral
leads
consistent with possible ischemia. Clinical correlation is
suggested.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2109-7-18**] the precordial
voltage is
less prominent.

TTE [**2109-7-19**]:
The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. The estimated right atrial pressure
is 5-10 mmHg. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. There
is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
inferior/infero-lateral hypokinesis. No masses or thrombi are
seen in the left ventricle. There is no ventricular septal
defect. The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with
normal free wall contractility. The diameters of aorta at the
sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild to moderate ([**12-24**]+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

CT Head [**2109-7-20**]:
 Chronic abnormalities, without evidence for acute intracranial
process.

EEG: [**2109-7-23**]
This telemetry captured no pushbutton activations. The recording

showed a slow background in all areas throughout, relatively
unchanged over the course of the recording. This suggests a
widespread encephalopathy.
Medications, metabolic disturbances, and infection among the
most common
causes. The regularity increases the possibility of medication
effect. There were no areas of prominent focal slowing, and
there were no clearly
epileptiform features or electrographic seizures.

Brief Hospital Course:
MICU Green Course

80y/o Male with multiple medical problems including [**Name (NI) 2091**], CVA,
CAD s/p [**Name (NI) 7792**], PVD, DM, dementia who presented with anemia and
melena c/w upper GI Bleed complicated by hyperglycemia and
[**Name (NI) 7792**]

# GI bleed/ Macrocytic Anemia:
Given melena, appears most c/w upper source. DDx includes
gastritis v. PUD v. AVM. Currently HDS. Of course black stools
could be confounded from iron supplemenation however that does
not explain Hct drop. Macrocytosis could be related to prior
ETOHism but has not had ETOH in many years. Vitamin B12 and
folate WNL in 12/[**2106**]. Could also have represented underlying
bone marrow process. Two 2 BRBC units were transfused with goal
Hct > 24 given CAD, PVD.His Hct remained stable at approx. 28-30
.
# Hyperglycemia/Diabetes:
On arrival to MICU, fingerstick elevated to 400's. Blood glucose
control with insulin drip and he was restarted on home NPH 22
units in the AM and 14 units in the PM with Humalog sliding
scale.

# Hypertension:
Chronic issue. Elevated to 150's systolic at the time of admit.
Better control with therapy in MICU.Continued clonidine,
metoprolol, and amlodipine and briefly was on nitro drip given
[**Year (4 digits) 7792**] below which was weaned off.

# CAD s/p [**Year (4 digits) 7792**]:
Chronic issue. On aspirin and plavix and imdur. No hx of CAD per
PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) **] at baseline.Given plavix load, full dose ASA and
heparin drip which will be continued for 48 hours. Cardiology
consulted and given multiple medical issues and peak in troponin
thought to be no role in cardiac catherization.

# Dementia: Chronic stable issue. Alzheimer's type dementia with
visual hallucinations. Per family between the hours of 3-5PM
every day he is unresponsive and sleeping, and barely arousable.

- continued with home meds

# Glaucoma: Chronic stable issue
- continued eye gtts

# Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin

# Code: DNI/DNR

Floor Course:

80m with h/o dementia, CAD s/p [**Name10 (NameIs) 7792**], [**Name10 (NameIs) 2091**], admitted [**7-15**] with
anemia and melanotic stool, transferred to MICU [**7-18**] for DKA,
transferred back to floor on [**2109-7-19**] whose hospital course was
complicated by [**Date Range 7792**] and [**Last Name (un) **] with increasing lethargy and
altered mental status.   He expired on [**2109-7-24**].
