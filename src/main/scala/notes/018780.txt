respond appropriately-> up to 23% only. EGD by GI showing
duodenal bulb ulcer w/artery in middle -> not amenable to
clipping/sclerosis. Pt. intubated in the MICU and taken to the
OR for definitive management. Ulcer oversewn. Given an
additional 5u PRBC, 4u FFP, and calcium in the OR. Neo on until
the end of the case to maintain blood pressure intra-op. Then
