Ms. [**Known lastname 18741**] is a 58 year old female with history of poorly

poorly. This all happened when she awoke suddenly and began

PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS:  The cardiomediastinal and
hilar contours
are normal.  The lungs are well expanded and clear, without
consolidation,
pleural effusion or pneumothorax. IMPRESSION:  No acute
cardiopulmonary pathology.

EKG: Sinus tachycardia. Diffuse non-specific ST segment changes
in the setting of J point elevation with early repolarization in
the anterior precordial leads. Compared to the previous tracing
of [**2137-5-28**], the precordial T waves are slightly less peaked and
the inferior ST-T wave changes are less pronounced. The
ventricular rate is slower.

Brief Hospital Course:
58-year-old female with poorly controlled type I diabetes,
gastroparesis, peripheral neuropathy, CVA, HTN, Hep C, and
multiple prior admissions with DKA presents with DKA in setting
of not taking [**Date Range 31217**] and poor PO intake.

ACTIVE PROBLEMS:
# Diabetic ketoacidosis, uncontrolled, complicated type I
diabetes mellitus, hypoglycemia: She is followed closely by
[**Hospital **] [**Hospital 982**] Clinic. She was initially started on [**Hospital 31217**]
drip and IV fluids. Her anion gap closed and [**Last Name (un) **] was
consulted to help with further titration of SC [**Last Name (un) 31217**]. THere
was no exacerbating factor for DKA other than likely
exacerbation of gastroparesis vs gastroenteritis and missed
[**Last Name (un) 31217**] doses. She was kept in the hospital a number of days for
titration of her [**Last Name (un) 31217**] regimen. Despite the close monitoring
she still had labile blood sugars. She did have multiple
episodes of hypoglycemia as an inpatient. The goal blood sugars
for her regimen are 150-250 given her propensity for
hypoglycemia. She was discharged with very close follow up with
[**Hospital **] [**Hospital 982**] Clinic and her primary care physician. [**Name10 (NameIs) 269**] was
resumed to help her with diabetes management. Social work was
also closely involved with her management to work on social
issues that may be exacerbating her difficult to control blood
sugars. Below is her discharge regimen:
