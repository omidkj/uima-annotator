CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Abdominal pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 83-year-old female
with a past medical history significant for gastroesophageal
reflux disease, colon cancer, status post colectomy, and
non-insulin dependent-diabetes mellitus, who was recently
admitted to [**Hospital3 **] for left lower quadrant
tenderness with a diagnosis of diverticulitis.  Of note, the
patient had previously been evaluated at [**Hospital1 **] Emergency
Room for lower abdominal pain and treated for a UTI with
Levaquin.  On admission at [**Hospital3 **], she was started
on cefoxitin with a white blood cell count of 9.0 at that
time.

On [**11-21**], she had a CT scan which showed diverticulosis, but
no diverticulitis, however, a left upper quadrant
inflammatory mass was noted and EGD was recommended.

On the morning of admission, the patient's white blood cell
count had climbed to 22 and she had increased tenderness.
EGD was subsequently performed and biopsy with 3-4 cm
duodenal ulcer was noted.  A followup KUB and chest x-ray was
performed, which demonstrated free air.  This is followed by
an emergent CT scan.  Of note, an initial BUN and creatinine
on admission were 20 and 1.3.  The patient had increased BUN
and creatinine of 53 and 1.7 and 45 and 1.4 earlier on that
day.  Patient was then transferred to [**Hospital1 **]
[**First Name (Titles) 2142**] [**Last Name (Titles) **] with diagnosis of duodenal ulcer.  Patient was
in no acute distress, but complaining of epigastric and right
upper quadrant abdominal pain.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
2. Colon cancer.
3. Status post ventral hernia repair.
4. Status post right colectomy.
5. Cataract surgery.
6. COPD with asthma.
7. Non-insulin dependent-diabetes mellitus.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:
1. Right colectomy.
2. Cataract surgery.
3. Bilateral total hip replacements in '[**31**] and '[**33**].

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Quitting tobacco 20 years ago, has a 20 pack
year history of smoking.  No alcohol and no IV drug use.  The
patient lives alone on her own.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Patient had a temperature of 99.1,
heart rate of 85, blood pressure 106/30, respiratory rate 18,
and O2 saturation 95% on 2 liters.  Patient was awake and
alert in no acute distress.  Had moist mucous membranes.  His
sclerae were nonicteric.  She had no jugular venous
distention.  Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Heart was regular, rate, and rhythm with normal S1, S2 with
no murmurs, rubs, or gallops appreciated.  Patient's abdomen
was distended.  She had a right upper quadrant epigastric
tenderness as well as right lower quadrant tenderness.  The
patient had a well-healed midline incision and a reducible
ventral hernia.  Patient had normal bowel sounds.  Her
extremities were warm and well perfused.  Rectal examination
showed normal tone, no masses, and was guaiac positive.

LABORATORY VALUES ON ADMISSION:  White blood cell count of
21.2, hematocrit of 36.5, and a platelet count of 243.
Patient had 90% segs, 5% lymphocytes, and 5% monocytes.
Patient's chemistry showed a sodium of 135, potassium of 4.4,
chloride of 101, bicarbonate of 26, BUN of 44, and a
creatinine of 1.2, glucose was 125.  Patient's calcium was
8.4, magnesium 2.1, and phosphorus of 3.3.  Her albumin was
2.7.  Patient's LFTs showed total bilirubin of 0.7, an ALT of
14, AST of 15, alkaline phosphatase 61.  PT of 14.4, PTT of
28.8, and INR of 1.4.  Patient's urinalysis showed [**6-6**] white
blood cells, occasional bacteria.  Patient was typed and
crossed for 2 units of blood.  A CE level was sent and was
pending.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  This was an 83-year-old female with
multiple medical problems now presenting with approximately 4
cm duodenal ulcer and free air underneath on chest x-ray.
Questionable whether this was a perforated duodenal ulcer.
Patient was admitted to ICU for hemodynamic monitoring.
Patient was made NPO, IV fluids were begun.  A Foley catheter
was placed.  Patient was started on antibiotics, ampicillin,
levofloxacin, and Flagyl, and question to the operating room
for exploration.

Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 957**] was consulted and was felt that the patient would
tolerate close observation in the ICU.  The patient was
placed on Protonix, carafate, and laboratories were to be
checked.

On hospital day #2, the patient reported that her pain had
been improved.  She was on ampicillin, levofloxacin, and
Flagyl.  The patient was afebrile with stable vital signs.
Was in the ICU.  On monitoring, the patient's white blood
cell count had trended down to 13.9.  Patient's hematocrit
was 28.2.  Patient seemed to be in stable condition.  The
plan was for serial hematocrits to follow if there was any
bleeding and to continue her on IV fluids and NPO.

On hospital day #3, the patient continued in the ICU, doing
well, was afebrile, and vital signs were stable.  Patient's
hematocrit had trended down to 25 and of note, white blood
cell count had also trended down to 11.8.  Patient continued
to be stating that her abdominal pain had felt improved.
There was less distention.  Patient had bowel sounds.

On hospital day #3, it was determined that the patient would
be stable enough to be transferred to the floor.  Upon
transfer to the floor later on that evening, patient was on
telemetry and was receiving 2 units of packed red blood
cells.  Repeat hematocrit showed her hematocrit to be 32.4,
however, it was discovered to have a large malonic looking
bowel movement.  Patient also become hypotensive with a
systolic blood pressure of 74 and heart rate from the 80s to
120s.  Fluid resuscitation was initiated.  A left subclavian
central venous catheter was placed, and patient was
retransferred to the ICU.  Patient had two additional units
of packed red blood cells transfused.  Patient was awake,
tachypneic, but appeared overall stable.  Blood gas drawn
showed the patient had a pH of 7.27, pCO2 of 29, pO2 of 182,
a bicarb of 14, and a base access of -11.

Emergent EGD was requested by the GI service, and it was felt
that the patient would likely require intubation for EGD.
Two large bore IVs were also established and close
hemodynamic monitoring was obtained within an arterial line
and CVP.  The patient had a Foley in place.  Serial
hematocrits were to be drawn and the patient was to be
transfused to keep hematocrits and coags in normal limits.
This event was discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 957**].

Patient was seen by GI, and a nasogastric lavage was
performed, which showed bright red blood.  Patient later on
that evening passed considerable amount of melena, and was
found to be hypotensive with blood pressure of 80/50 and
heart rate of 120.  An EGD was performed which showed blood
in the antrum and pylorus, an ulcer in the antrum which was
nonbleeding, blood in the second part of the duodenum, third
part of the duodenum, and no actively bleeding lesions in the
stomach or duodenum that were potentially treatable during
endoscopy.  Patient had to receive 6 units of blood and 4
units of FFP, and continued to have decreases in her
hematocrit.  It was felt then by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 957**] that the patient
should proceed directly to the operating room in an attempt
to gain control of the bleeding.

Patient was taken to the operating room in which an
antrectomy, splenectomy, vagotomy, partial pancreatectomy,
and Billroth-II anastomosis was performed.  The patient
tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to the PACU
intubated and placed on ICU status.
