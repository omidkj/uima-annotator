HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 83-year-old Caucasian
female with history of dementia, hypertension, chronic renal
insufficiency, who was initially admitted to [**Hospital1 346**] on [**1-5**] for acute mental
metabolic toxic encephalopathy from acute and chronic renal
failure, questionable Tylenol overdose with transaminitis,
and an untreated urinary tract infection superimposed on her
underlying dementia.

On the night of admission, the patient acutely decompensated
with an increased heart rate, increased respiratory rate,
requiring an immediate transfer to the Intensive Care Unit.
There she was found to have multiple pulmonary emboli, and
was started on a Heparin drip for adequate anticoagulation.

Unfortunately, this resulted in a massive intracranial
hemorrhage within the occipital horns and the patient has had
severe cognitive decline ever since to the point of
unresponsiveness.  Her hospital course has been marked by
worsening renal and hepatic dysfunction associated with
multiple metabolic derangements requiring intubation, blood
loss anemia requiring multiple transfusions, a renal mass
suspicious for malignancy, and an acute myocardial
infarction, event associated pneumonia.

Since the patient was without friends or family, a legal
guardian was appointed by the state and the patient's code
status was changed to DNR/DNI.  The patient was transferred
out of the Intensive Care Unit on [**1-17**] once her code
status was finalized, and  passed away the next
day ([**1-18**]) at 12:45 pm.  An autopsy was granted by
her guardian, Ms. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 8214**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].
