HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient presented to [**Hospital **]
Hospital on [**2121-2-10**] with back pain and shortness of breath
and was found on chest x-ray and CT to have pulmonary
nodules, liver, and renal masses. She underwent biopsy of a
left groin nodule and the skin nodule revealing melanoma and
was diagnosed with metastatic melanoma. She was subsequently
transferred to [**Hospital1 69**] on
[**2121-2-13**] for further management. On admission, her back
pain was managed with MS Contin with p.r.n. morphine with
good response. A CT was negative for brain metastasis. She
underwent a spinal MRI to rule out cord compression which
revealed multiple lytic lesions but no spinal cord
compression. Treatment options were discussed and high-dose
IL-2 therapy was recommended. She initiated high-dose IL-2 on
[**2121-2-15**] after undergoing central line placement in
interventional radiology. During this week, she received
[**11-25**] doses of IL-2 with course complicated by pulmonary
edema. She was managed with oxygen supplementation and
aggressive Lasix diuresis as well as albuterol nebulizers.
Her respiratory status worsened over the next 36 hours,
requiring ICU transfer for aggressive diuresis and fluid
management. She did not require intubation. She was treated
with antibiotics for a possible pneumonia. She slowly
improved with Lasix diuresis and was transferred out of the
ICU on [**2121-2-26**] and was able to be discharged to home later
that day when ambulating off O2 without noted hypoxia.

Other side effects during this week included rigors improved
with Demerol; nausea improved with antiemetic therapy; normal
sinus tachycardia and development of an erythematous skin
rash.

During this week, she had no renal failure noted. She
developed transaminitis with a peak ALT of 156 and a peak AST
of 200, both improved at the time of discharge. She developed
hyperbilirubinemia with a peak bilirubin of 4.7 improved to
3.2 at the time of discharge. She was anemic without need for
packed red blood cell transfusion. She developed
thrombocytopenia with a platelet count low of 85,000 without
evidence of bleeding. She had no myocarditis or coagulopathy
noted. By [**2121-2-27**], she had recovered from side effects to
allow for discharge to home.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  To home with her family.
