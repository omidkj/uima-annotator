Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 896**]
Chief Complaint:
Diarrhea & hypotension.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Right internal jugular central venous line placement.

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 14879**] is a 76 yo M with multiple medical problems including
[**Known lastname 2182**]/interstitial lung disease, dCMP (35% with PA sHTN), AFib
s/p AV node ablation, h/o Vtach s/p BiV ICD, h/o PE, adrenal
insufficiency on chronic steroids, CKD stage III-IV, severe
[**Known lastname 1106**] disease s/p multiple interventions with recent
admissions for HAP and hyponatremia who presented to the ED
after sudden onset of severe diarrhea, associated abdominal pain
and lethargy at home. The pt recalls having multiple episodes of
diarrhea overnight. When his caretaker came over this morning,
he did not answer the door, and she called EMS. Was found to
have SBP 90 by EMS, but was A&O x 3. In the ED, Lactate improved
from 3.8 to 2.1 with 4L IVF, but remained hypotensive with SBP
in 80s. Guaiac negative in the ED. He recieved doses of vanco,
zosyn, and flagyl, as well as 100 mg hydrocortisone at the
advice of the pt's outpatient endocrinologist. Bedside cardiac
US in the ED showed poor contractility. Ultimately, BP fell as
low as 70/30. R IJ was placed and pt was started on levophed,
currently at 0.25mcg/min. CVP 15. Pt was admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for
shock, which was presumed to be multifactorial - septic,
cardiac, and adrenal insufficiency. At the time of transfer,
vitals were HR 78, RR 22, sat 100%, BP 94/40 on 0.25mcg/min of
norepinephrine.

Upon arrival to the [**Name (NI) **], pt is having continued diarrhea. Denies
fever or chills. Cough and breathing feel at baseline. No
abdominal pain. Appetite has been "fair." Pt is aware of where
he is currently, but does not rememeber most of the events of
this morning.

Imaging Studies:

CT ABD/PELVIS:
1. Focal area of mild stranding about the pancreatic head is a
nonspecific finding. No abnormalities are seen in the adjacent
gallbladder, liver, or pancreas except for cholelithiasis. No
evidence of cholecystitis.
2. Small bilateral pleural effusions. Adjacent ground-glass
nodules and septal thickening may represent aspiration event
with a superimposed mild interstitial edema.
3. Multiple loops of fluid-filled bowel, in a nonobstructive
pattern, likely due to gastroenteritis. There are no secondary
signs of ischemia such as pneumatosis. Further evaluation,
however, is limited due to lack of IV contrast.
4. Severe, extensive atherosclerotic calcifications throughout
the major arteries and coronary vessels.
5. Anterior compression deformity at T12, of unknown chronicity.


CXR: One view. Comparison with the previous study done [**2171-12-14**].
Diffuse bilateral pulmonary infiltrates likely representing
[**Month/Day/Year 1106**] congestion
superimposed on chronic interstitial lung disease persist. There
is evidence for small pleural effusions, not significantly
changed, as well. The heart and mediastinal structures are
stable. An ICD and right internal jugular catheter remain in
place.

Brief Hospital Course:
1. Hypotension: The most likely etiology of the shock on
presentation was hypovolemia from diarrhea and continued
diuretic use.  There may be some component of blood loss as well
given lower HCT and MCV, though this is less clear.  He has had
abnormal EGD and [**Last Name (un) **] recently with guaiac positive stools here.


Whether there has also a concominent pneumonia (possibly
aspiration) was less clear.  He reported no respiratory symptoms
to suggest this.  Was treated empirically, during stay and
discharged to complete 7 day course of levofloxacin.

Regarding adrenal insuffiency, he is chronically on steroids;
stress dose steroids in setting of his shock was appropriate.
Was he stablized, returned him to home dose of hydrocortisone.

2. Congestive heart failure, systolic.  Some pulmonary edema on
CXR; given hypotension furosemide was held during stay, but
should be restarted after discharge (recommended restarting the
day after discharge).  Other medications (metoprolol, digoxin)
were also
