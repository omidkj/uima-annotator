History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a [**Age over 90 **] yo male transferred from the MICU, with
PMH AF, RVR, HTN, hyperchol, CAD with fixed LAD stenosis,
diastolic dysfunction, and h/o CVA and GIB on Coumadin.  Pt
presented [**8-28**] - [**8-29**] with afib RVR with hypotension that
responded to IVF and rate control with beta blocker.  After
being dc'd home he returned after afalling at home.  In ED, he
had intermittent PAF with rate up to 140's.  ADmitting to floor
medical team with increased rate control.  The next AM he was
found to be tachypnic and diaphoretic by RN.  RA sats were 39%,
then 70% on NRB.  Tachy at 110, hypertensive intitially
150s/100s, then dropped to SBP 80s with increased HR to
140-150s.  EKG revealed AFib RVR.  ABG at the time revealed
increase A:a gradiet.  Presumed pulmonary edema d/t afib RVR and
diastolic dysfuction.  IN MICU, pt was diuresed with Lasix, rate
controlled with metoprolo x 1, spontaneously converted to NSR
and then had episodes of bradycardia to 29 without change in
blood pressure.  Also has had 2.6 sec conversion pause from AF
converting to NSR.  Pt has been NSR x 24 hours with BP
controlled.

Echo: [**8-29**]: The left atrium is markedly dilated. The right
atrium is moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion
abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Left ventricular systolic
function is probably normal but views are technically
suboptimal. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened. No
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There
is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.

Compared with the report of the prior study (tape unavailable
for review) of [**2184-12-7**], there is no definite change.

ELECTROCARDIOGRAM PERFORMED ON: [**2187-8-27**]
Atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response. Left
bundle-branch
block. Since the previous tracing of [**2184-12-1**] sinus rhythm has
been replaced by
atrial fibrillation.

ELECTROCARDIOGRAM PERFORMED ON: [**2187-9-3**]
Sinus rhythm
Conduction defect of LBBB type
Since last ECG, anterior T wave inversion is gone

MRI/MRA:
Subacute infarction in the distribution of the right and middle
cerebral artery.

Occluded right vertebral artery. No evidence of abnormality in
the right middle cerebral artery distribution, although exam is
somewhat limited as discussed above.

Carotid U/S:
Findings as stated above which indicate an approximately 40 to
59% right ICA stenosis, no significant left ICA stenosis (graded
as less than
40%).


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is an independently living [**Age over 90 **]yo male with A Fib
with rapid ventricular response (RVR), HTN, hyperchol, CAD with
fixed LAD stenosis, diastolic dysfunction, h/o CVA, and H.
Pylori gastric ulcer GI bleed on Coumadin ([**2180**]).  Pt presented
[**8-28**] - [**8-29**] with AFib RVR with hypotension that responded to IVF
and rate control with beta blocker. After being discharged home
he returned [**8-30**] after falling at home.  He was found to be in
afib and admitted to medicine, but had pulmonary edema from
rapid rate and diastolic dysfunction and sent to the MICU. There
he had elevated troponins to a peak of 0.07 and T-wave
inversions in leads V2-V4, suggesting ischemia.  He has known
reversible defects in his anterior and apical walls in [**2181**].  In
the MICU, he was diuresed with Lasix, rate controlled with
metoprolol x 1, and spontaneously converted to NSR.  He had
episodes of bradycardia to 29 and a 2.6 sec conversion pause
from AFib converting to NSR.  Pt was transferred to the
cardiology floor for AFib control and evaluation for cardiac
cath and pacer placement.  Pt had two subsequent episodes of
AFib with RVR converting to NSR with IV metoprolol x 1.
Additionally, he had 4 seconds of asystole which spontaneously
converted to sinus without symtoms.  Pt refused catheterization,
and initially refused pacer placement.  However, after some
thought he agreed and had a [**Company **] dual chamber pacemaker
(A-V sequential pacemaker) placed on [**9-4**] without complication.
 Pt remained in NSR with a rate of 70 with his pacer.  Pt was
started on Sotalol.

Pt's hosptial course was complicated by a TIA on [**9-2**].  His TIA
was thought to be embolic, involving his right MCA territory
with subsequent left limb weakness, neglect, and dysarthria.
His symptoms resolved completely within 12 hours.  The source of
his embolism was likely his left atrium, given his paroxysmal
conversion between AFib RVR and tachy/brady sinus rhthym.  Pt
has a history of GI bleed d/t H. Pylori gastric ulcer in [**2180**] on
Coumadin, but his H. Pylori was treated appropriately.  The
contraindication to anticoagulation in this pt is his risk of
fall.  He will be anticoagulated with Heparin/Coumadin while at
rehab, with the understanding that Coumadin will be discontinued
when the patient returns home after rehab given his significant
risk of fall.

The etiology of his falls are likely multifactorial in origin.
Per neurology, it seems pt has some signs of early Parkinsons,
with decreased proprioception in his feet.  Also, his conversion
pauses between AFib RVR and NSR could also be owing to his
falls.
