Date of Birth:   [**2144-10-18**]     Sex:  F

Service:  [**Company 191**]

HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 52-year-old woman
with a history of cervical adenocarcinoma stage II, status
post radiation in [**2187**] who was diagnosed with right lung
adenocarcinoma with fine-needle aspiration in [**2196-6-6**]
after CT scan revealed a right lung mass in the setting of
elevated tumor marker with CEA up to 16.4.  The CT revealed a
mass of 2.5 cm by 5 cm in the right upper lobe.  She had a
PET scan which staged cancer as stage III A or B at [**Hospital3 7778**].  She had three runs of chemo which was stopped in
[**2196-8-7**] secondary to hemolytic anemia but she did
complete a course of XRT.

She has been hospitalized at an outside hospital several
times since [**2196-10-7**] for recurrent episodes of
fevers, progressive pulmonary infiltrates and most recently
intractable nausea and vomiting.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  She was initially thought to have
radiation-induced pneumonitis for which she was treated with
steroids, but she also received Levaquin for presumptive
pneumonia.  She has been on steroids for chemo-induced
hemolytic anemia and radiation-induced pneumonitis.  She also
received several transfusions for hemolytic anemia.

On [**2196-12-15**], she had bronchioloalveolar lavage which
revealed Aspergillus and [**Female First Name (un) 564**] and possible atypical
Mycobacteria.  Hyphae was seen in cytology but the path was
not sufficient for evaluation of invasive Aspergillus.  Her
AFB studies had remained negative until bronchoalveolar
lavage on [**2197-1-4**] which grew out positive atypical
Mycobacteria (Gordonii) for which she was started on
itraconazole on [**2196-12-17**] for possible invasive
aspergillosis.  She was switched to Amphotericin B on [**2196-12-31**] secondary to failure to improve.  She was also
started on triple regimen on [**2197-1-4**] for atypical
Mycobacteria infection.  The triple regimen included
Rifabutin, ethambutol, and Clarithromycin, but the CT scan
showed progressive cavitary lesions in the upper right lower
lobe and dense consolidation in the base of right lower lobe.

She was started on vancomycin on [**2196-12-31**] after acute
aspiration episode but the vancomycin was discontinued on
[**2197-1-2**].  In addition, she was also started on
meropenem on [**2196-12-31**] for Enterobacter UTI.

Her most recent admission to the outside hospital on [**2196-12-25**] was notable for intractable nausea and vomiting.
She had an EGD which revealed gastritis.  She continued to
have intermittent fevers and a persistent productive cough of
greenish sputum with right-sided chest pain but without
hemoptysis.  She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further workup
of the right lower lobe process including possible open lung
biopsy.  She had repeated fine-needle aspiration of the right
lower lobe cavitary lesion but the results were inconclusive.
She is followed by both ID and the Pulmonary Service.

She continued to have intermittent fevers and a persistent
productive cough with right-sided chest pain.  Since her
symptoms had no response to the broad antibiotic coverage and
her cultures here remained unremarkable, triple antibiotics
for atypical bacterial infection were discontinued and
meropenem and the vancomycin were switched to levofloxacin
and clindamycin to cover likely postobstructive pneumonia.
Amphotericin B was also switched to p.o. voriconazole for
possible invasive aspergillosis.

After a long discussion between Infectious Disease, Pulmonary
and Thoracic Surgery, the decision was made not to pursue
open lung biopsy given her critical condition.  She was
scheduled to go for a bronchoscopy on [**2197-1-20**] for
both diagnostic biopsy and therapeutic stenting of the
collapsed bronchial.

Unfortunately, the patient went into respiratory failure in
the early morning of [**2197-1-20**].  She was intubated on
the floor and was transferred to the VICU for further care as
the patient remained full code at that time.  However, the
patient continued to deteriorate and required pressors for
blood pressure support.

Given her overall poor prognosis, after a long discussion
with the family, the decision was made to withdrawal care at
that time.  The patient passed away peacefully on [**2197-1-20**] in the presence of her family.
