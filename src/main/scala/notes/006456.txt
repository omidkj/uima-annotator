HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a  28-year-old woman who
presented to [**Hospital3 **] with complaints of four days of
nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.  The patient also reported
intermittent chest pain.  At the outside hospital, she had an
electrocardiogram notable for ST depressions in the lateral
leads with troponin I elevation at 8.53.  At the outside
hospital, she was given 3200-unit bolus of heparin,
Integrilin bolus, 300 mg of Plavix, 2.5 mg of intravenous
Lopressor, and normal saline.

The patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 188**] for a catheterization.  The patient noted to have 70
percent ostial stenosis which was stented with a 3.5-mm X 13-
mm Cypher [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **].  A left ventriculography noted a left
ventricular ejection fraction of 50 percent.  Following the
procedure, the patient was noted to have a large right groin
hematoma.  Hematocrit from 42 on admission to 33.8.  The
patient was given intravenous fluids.  Compression was
applied to the area, and the patient was transferred to the
Coronary Care Unit for management.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Sister with lupus.  Father with cancer.
Mother epilepsy.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  She quit tobacco 40 years ago.  Occasional
alcohol.  She is married with two children.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Temperature was 99.3,
her blood pressure was 168/122, her heart rate was 73, her
respiratory rate was 16, and her saturations were 97 percent
on 2 liters nasal cannula oxygen.  In general,  an elderly
female lying in bed and sedated.  Head, eyes, ears, nose, and
throat examination revealed normocephalic and atraumatic.
The pupils were equal, round, and reactive to light.  The
extraocular muscles were intact.  The mucous membranes were
moist.  Neck with no carotid bruits.  Cardiovascular
examination revealed a rate and rhythm.  Normal first and
second heart sounds.  There were no murmurs, rubs, or
gallops.  The lungs were clear to auscultation anteriorly.
The abdomen was soft, nontender, and nondistended.  There
were positive bowel sounds.  Extremities revealed no
clubbing, cyanosis or edema.  There was a large right groin
hematoma, mildly tense.

PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:  White blood
cell count at the outside hospital was 14.3, hematocrit was
42.4, and platelets were 219.  Sodium was 138, potassium was
3.7, chloride was 98, bicarbonate was 23, blood urea nitrogen
was 13, creatinine was 1, and blood glucose was 115 now 79.3,
ALT was 20, AST 95.  Troponin I was 8.53.  Complete blood
count here at 8:10 on admission revealed a hematocrit of
33.8.

PERTINENT RADIOLOGY-IMAGING:  An electrocardiogram at [**Hospital1 1444**] revealed a normal sinus
rhythm at a rate of 53.  Normal intervals.  Normal axis.
Left atrial enlargement.  T wave inversions in II, III, aVF,
and V4 through V6.

Catheterization report as above.  Left ventriculography with
no mitral regurgitation, posterobasal hypokinesis, and left
ventricular ejection fraction of about 50 percent.

Coronary angiography with a right-dominant system, left main
coronary artery with mild disease, left anterior descending
with mild diffuse disease, the left circumflex with mild
diffuse disease, the right coronary artery with 70 percent
ostial stenosis with catheter dampening to AV groove with
spasm.

SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient is a 78-year-old
woman with successful [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] placement and percutaneous
transluminal coronary angioplasty of her right coronary
artery complicated by a right groin hematoma.

1. INFERIOR MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION:  The patient had her
   enzymes cycled until her creatine kinases peaked and was
   continued on aspirin, Plavix, and a statin.  Her beta
   blocker and ACE inhibitor were temporarily held as her
   blood pressure and heart rate were not able to tolerate,
   and these were slowly started back prior to discharge.
   Otherwise, the patient was stable after her inferior
   myocardial infarction after right coronary artery stent
   and nitrodilatation spasm.

The patient's myocardial infarction course was complicated by
episodes of Wenckebach on telemetry.  This was likely
secondary to her right coronary artery distribution of her
myocardial infarction.  The patient did not require any doses
of atropine and continued to be monitored on telemetry.
Eventually these resolved, and the patient was otherwise
stable and will follow up with her outpatient cardiologist.

Because of evidence of a murmur on examination, the patient
had an echocardiogram which just showed mild mitral
regurgitation, but was otherwise stable.  Again, the patient
was started back on her angiotensin receptor blocker,
aspirin, and Plavix.  She was not started back on a beta
blocker prior to discharge because of the episodes of
Wenckebach, and these can be started back as an outpatient
once she follow ups with her cardiologist and these are
resolved.

1. RIGHT GROIN HEMATOMA:  The patient was stable.  The
   patient had compression as needed aggressively for the
   first 12 hours.  When she had control of the bleeding, she
   had stable pulses and had an ultrasound done which showed
   no evidence of pseudoaneurysm.

The patient's hematocrits were closely monitored initially,
and these remained stable.  She was eventually transfused 2
units of packed red blood cells, and her pulses did remain
palpable.  Again, an ultrasound revealed no pseudoaneurysm,
and the hematoma was stable in size.  The patient was seen
and followed by the Vascular Surgery Service for the
hematoma, but no intervention besides manual pressure was
required.

1. CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE:  The patient with an ejection
   fraction of about 50 percent; however, she did receive
   plenty of fluids during her peri procedure time period and
   responded well to Lasix.

1. ASTHMA:  The patient with a known history of asthma and
   was continued on her home regimen of Maxair and Flovent.

1. HYPOTHYROIDISM:  Stable.  The patient was continued on her
   home dose of Synthroid.


CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Good; the patient was ambulating,
was seen by Physical Therapy, and was tolerating ambulation
without difficulty, but recommended home physical therapy and
safety evaluation just to minimize risks and fall risk with
her groin hematoma.  The patient's blood pressure medications
were titrated up with good control.  The patient's groin
hematoma was stable.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  To home with home physical therapy and
home safety evaluation.

1. Inferior myocardial infarction.
2. Coronary artery disease.
3. Asthma.
4. Hypertension.
5. Right groin hematoma.
