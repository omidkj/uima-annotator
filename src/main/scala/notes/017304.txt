On Discharge:
nonfocal
incision c/d/i with staples

Pertinent Results:
MR HEAD W & W/O CONTRAST [**2149-6-12**]
1.  Large enhancing mass with hemorrhage in the right frontal
lobe with
associated significant perilesional edema causing mass effect on
the frontal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of right lateral ventricle and shift of midline
structures to the left.  This is concerning for metastasis.

2.  Small enhancing lesions in the right and left parietal bones
which may represent hemangiomas or bone metastases.
3. Diffuse T1 hypointensity noted of the marrow of the skull,
which may
represent marrow reconversion. However, possibility of marrow
infiltration cannot be ruled out.

4.  No evidence of acute infarct.

CT head [**2149-6-14**] POST OPERATIVE:
1.  Post-right frontal tumor resection, with no evidence of
hemorrhage or
acute mass effect at the surgical bed.
2.  Expected mild pneumocephalus and subcutaneous emphysema at
the right
craniectomy site.

MR HEAD W & W/O CONTRAST [**2149-6-15**]
1.  Post-surgical changes, along with fluid-filled cavity at the
surgical
resection site in the right frontal lobe, with blood products
and fluid level within.  Minimal peripheral enhancement can
relate to the reactive changes.  No obvious nodular enhancement
to suggest obvious tumor.  However, consider followup for better
assessment of the tumor after resolution of the reactive
changes.

No new lesions.

Persistent moderate vasogenic edema and leftward shift of
midline structures, with leftward displacement of the anterior
cerebral arteries.  Follow up closely.


Brief Hospital Course:
58 y/o F with known NSCLC presents with nausea and loss of
appetite. Patient's oncologist recommended an MRI of head which
revealed a new R frontal lesion. She was admitted to the
neurosurgery service for further evaluation and monitoring. On
[**6-14**], she was taken to the OR with no complications. Post
operatively, she was extubated and transferred to the ICU. Post
op head CT shows post operative changes with stable vasogenic
edema. On [**6-15**], MRI head was completed which showed vasogenic
edema with post surgical changes, no residual tumor was seen. On
[**6-17**], patient remained stable on exam, PT has cleared her safe
to discharge home.
