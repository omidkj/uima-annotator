never
had any overt pain or nausea or vomiting in the many years that

[**2128-7-30**] Pathology Diagnosis:  Ventral hernia, excision (A):
Mesothelial-lined fibroadipose tissue consistent with hernia
sac.
Left spermatic cord lipoma, excision (B):
Mature adipose tissue consistent with lipoma.
Right spermatic cord lipoma, excision (C):
Mature adipose tissue consistent with lipoma.

[**2128-8-2**]  KUB: SUPINE FRONTAL AND FRONTAL DECUBITUS VIEWS OF THE
ABDOMEN: There is no pneumoperitoneum or pneumatosis. Note is
made of numerous air- and fluid-filled loops of large and small
bowel, with scattered air-fluid levels seen on the decubitus
view. Overall, given the postoperative status of the patient,
these findings suggest an ileus. Cutaneous staples are present
in the midline of the lower abdomen. Degenerative changes are
mild at the hips bilaterally. Note is made of a small amount of
subsegmental atelectasis in the left lower lobe.

[**2128-8-3**] PCXR:  FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**4-20**],
there are lower lung volumes with continued evidence of chronic
pulmonary disease and atelectasis at the base on the left.
Dilatation of gas-filled loops of large and small bowel are
consistent with the clinical diagnosis of adynamic ileus. The
nasogastric tube extends to the region of the distal stomach.

[**2128-8-6**] PCXR:  FINDINGS: Since chest radiograph from [**2128-8-3**], there are no significant relevant interval changes. The
right upper lobe cystic spaces with surrounding consolidation
are unchanged since the prior radiograph.  Bilateral mild
pleural effusions are stable. No new opacities in the lungs.
Cardiomediastinal shadow is stable. Some mild atelectasis is
seen in  bilateral lung bases.

[**2128-8-6**]  CT Head:  IMPRESSION:
1. No acute intracranial pathologic process.
2. Hyperdense extra-axial lesion in the anterior falx, unchanged
since [**2121**]
and likely represents a meningioma.
3. Right frontal chronic subdural collection likely representing
hygroma,
unchanged since most recent study on [**2127-12-29**].

[**2128-8-7**]  CT of Chest, Abdomen, Pelvis  IMPRESSION:
1. Bilateral opacities at the lung bases, left greater than
right, which
could represent infectious process such as aspiration pneumonia.
2. Ectasia of the aorta and bilateral external iliac arteries
along with the left internal iliac artery.
3. Increased size of the mediastinal lymphadenopathy when
compared to prior
scans.

Brief Hospital Course:
General Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the General Surgical Service for
evaluation and treatment.  On [**2128-7-30**], the patient underwent
ventral and bilateral inguinal herniorraphy, which went well
without complication (reader referred to the Operative Note for
details). After a brief, uneventful stay in the PACU, the
patient arrived on the floor NPO, on IV fluids, and dilaudid for
pain control.  The patient was hemodynamically stable.

Of note, beginning the night of POD 6 patient began to become
agitated and by the morning of POD 7 was becoming increasingly
disoriented and agitated.  On exam patient was AO x 0, not
following commands, tremulous, and delirious.  CV was RRR with
nl S1 and S2, lungs were CTA but patient was exhibiting
tachypnea and 02 sats were in low 90s.  Abdomen continued to be
soft and non-distended.  PXCR showed no change from [**8-4**].
Patient was transferred to ICU for further evaluation and
monitoring, CT of Head, Chest, Abd, and Pelvis were ordered
which were largely unremarkable for acute process, and blood
cultures and urine cultures were sent which did not show any
growth.  Patient had a brief, 2 day stay in ICU and was returned
to the floor in good health with near baseline return of
function.

Neuro: The patient received IV dilaudid, PO oxycodone and
tylenol with good effe
