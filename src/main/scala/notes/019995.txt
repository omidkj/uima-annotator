ADDENDUM:

The rest of the [**Hospital 228**] hospital course will be covered
systematically.

1.  Cardiovascular:  The patient was medically treated for
coronary artery disease with enteric coated aspirin 325,
Lipitor 10 mg, Hydralazine, Metoprolol, Isosorbide, and
Norvasc.  Doses have been titrated and weaned appropriately
to maintain adequate blood pressure control.

On discharge, her blood pressure medications include
Hydralazine 100 mg p.o. q. six hours; Lopressor 50 mg twice a
day; Imdur 60 mg p.o. three times a day; and Norvasc 5 mg
p.o. q. day.  These doses will likely have to change as the
patient has had episodes of hypotension which required
holding many of the blood pressure medications.

During the course of the hospital stay, the patient had one
episode of chest pain.  EKG at the time showed no significant
changes.  The patient ruled out by cardiac enzymes.  The
patient had an echocardiogram done which showed an ejection
fraction of 40%, hypokinesis of inferior and posterior walls,
two plus mitral regurgitation.  A Persantine MIBI was
performed which revealed perfusion abnormalities of inferior
lateral region induced by Persantine.  Therapeutic options
were discussed with the patient chose to continue with
medical therapy.  If patient continues with further episodes
of clinical manifestation of coronary artery disease, more
invasive intervention may be necessary down the line.

The patient's congestive heart failure improved upon rigorous
diuresis.  Her diuretic regimen was weaned down and the
patient is being discharged on Lasix 100 mg p.o. q. day.  At
baseline, the patient has bibasilar rales, left slightly
greater than right, one-third of the way up.

2.  Renal:  The patient initially required hemodialysis with
a creatinine of 5.7.  The creatinine fell down to around 2.9
before stabilizing close to 3.0.  On discharge her creatinine
is 3.3.  Her BUN also trended higher before stabilizing
around 120.  This was initially thought to be secondary to
overly aggressive diuresis and is one of the reasons why the
diuretic regimen was weaned down.  The patient will likely
need close renal follow-up on an outpatient basis as she has
chronic renal failure and will likely require hemodialysis
down the line.

The patient was consulted by Renal and PTH was tested.
Levels came back 160, which being less than 200, did not
necessitate starting the patient on Rocaltrol.  The patient
was also started on Epogen 4000 units twice a week.  Her iron
levels were tested prior to starting, her iron being 36; she
was started on iron sulfate 325 mg q. day.

3.  Infectious Disease:  The patient was started on a 14 day
course of Flagyl for Clostridium difficile.  Subsequent C.
difficile stool toxins proved negative, however, the patient
had showed clinical improvement with the antibiotics with her
white blood cell count falling and diarrhea eventually going
away.  The patient remains on Flagyl; she is day nine of 14,
and should receive five more days of metronidazole 500 mg
three times a day.

4.  Gastrointestinal:  After having a lower GI bleed on
admission, the patient was started on Protonix 40 mg twice a
day.  This dose was weaned to 40 mg q. day.  The patient's
hematocrit remained stable.  Near the end of her hospital
course, the patient was noted to still have guaiac positive
stool.  This may account for some of the rise in BUN that was
noticed during the course of admission, however, the
patient's hematocrit remained stable.

GI had been consulted and recommended no intervention at this
time.  The patient may reserve further outpatient GI
follow-up and possibly colonoscopy down the line.

5.  Pain:  The patient had been under a lot of pain during
the course of admission.  It was found that this pain was
contributing to her tachypnea.  Once the patient's pain
management was better controlled with a Percocet regimen and
topical ointment on rectal region ulcer, the patient's pain
level decreased and the patient improved clinically.

6.  Endocrine:  The patient's sugar has been elevated during
the course of admission.  Her NPH regimen was gradually
titrated up.  On discharge, she is getting 4 units NPH in the
a.m. and 16 units in the p.m., but still requires coverage
with insulin sliding scale.  The patient also has been
getting Levothyroxine for her hypothyroidism and she will
continue to get 100 micrograms p.o. q. day after discharge.

The patient should be followed up with her primary care
physician at the [**Name9 (PRE) 756**].  She has been given the choice of
whether to follow-up with Cardiology and Renal at [**Hospital1 346**] or to follow-up at the [**Hospital1 756**].

On discharge, the patient is hemodynamically stable, alert
and oriented times three, with a stable hematocrit.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of
40%.
2.  Non-ST elevation myocardial infarction with a troponin of
greater than 50.
3.   Acute renal failure with creatinine of 5.7, requiring
emergent hemodialysis.
4.  Chronic renal failure with the creatinine stabilizing at
3.0.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Enteric coated aspirin 325 mg p.o. q. day.
2.  Lipitor 10 mg p.o. q. day.
3.  Hydralazine 100 mg p.o. q. six hours; hold for a systolic
blood pressure less than 90.
4.  Metoprolol 50 mg p.o. twice a day; hold for systolic
blood pressure less than 100; heart rate less than 55.
5.  Imdur 60 mg p.o. three times a day; hold for systolic
blood pressure less than 100.
6.  Norvasc 5 mg p.o. q. day.  Hold for systolic blood
pressure less than 90.
7.  Lasix 100 mg p.o. q. day.
8.  Protonix 40 mg p.o. q. day.
9.  NPH 40 units a.m. and 16 units p.m.

14. Percocet one to two tablets p.o. q. four to six hours
p.r.n. for pain.
15. Levothyroxine 100 micrograms p.o. q. day.
16. Zolpidem 5 mg p.o. h.s. p.r.n. for sleep.
