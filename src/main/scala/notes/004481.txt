Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7202**]
Chief Complaint:
chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac catheterization, status post placement of drug-eluting
stents.


History of Present Illness:
52 y.o. pt of Dr.[**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], with h/o silent MI in [**2145**], DM, HTN,
with known 2 vessel disease by OSH cath report transferred to [**Hospital1 **]
for a possible intervention.
The patient was admitted to the OSH on [**2147-4-9**] with a one-week
history of nausea and non-bilious non-bloody vomiting. The
patient also describes symtpoms of fatigue and malaise over the
last week. For 2-3 days prior to admission she had had atypical
angina. She describes episodes of intermittent shortness of
breath with associated left sided chest pain that would
frequently happen at rest. She describes left sided chest pain
as sharp, lasting "minutes", localized over left shoulder and
radiating to left upper arm, pain would change with change in
arm position. Patient was admitted to [**Hospital 1474**] hospital and
treated with supportive therapy/antiemetrics. She was given SL
NTG with resolution of her symptoms. She ruled out MI with three
sets of enzymes. On [**2147-4-10**] she underwent p-MIBI which showed
inferior ischemia/no infarct. The patient was then cathed at the
OSH and cath revealed 2 vessel disease: 85-90% proximal LAD and
70% RCA stenosis, dampening LMA; normal left heart hemodynamics.
Per Dr.[**Last Name (STitle) **], it was decided to tx the patient here for further
treatment.

Patient had stents to LAD placed on [**2147-4-13**]. During the
procedure she developed CP/nausea with 2mm ST elevations in
inferior leads, became bradycardic and was given atropine and
dopamine. Flow in LAD/LCX normal/no dissection. RCA was stented
with 2.5x18mm Cypher stent with no residual, TIMI 3 flow.

Following the procedure she ruled in for myocardial infarction
by enzymes but was symptomatically stable until early morning
[**2147-4-15**] when she developed acute chest pain with EKG changes. In
stent thrombosis was suspected and she was brought emergently to
the cath lab. In the cath lab, she was found to have thrombus in
her LAD.Export catheter was used to remove the clot when she
started having EMD. Code was called and she was defibrllated and
pressor were started. Stent was successfully deployed in the
LAD. She went into VF and was again shocked. It was then decided
that she might have had coronary spasm and showering of emboli.
All pressors were stopped and 2000mcg diltiazem were given
intracoronary and she return to NSR. Echocardiogram was done and
ruled out pericardial tamponade but anterior wall AK. SHe
recieved 6 unit of blood transfusion during the procedure. CT
surgery evaluated patient in the catheterization lab but surgery
was not deemed to be indicated at that time. Patient was
transferred to the CCU.

Pertinent Results:
*******Cath [**2147-4-13**]
2 vessel disease. Ao 142/82/108
RCA mid 80%;  LMCA duffuse 40%  (FFR 0.95 suggestivng non-flow
limiting stenosis); LAD diffuse 40%; LAD prox 90%, mid 80-90%.
Interventions: 1. Prox LAD lesion could not be crossed with
Cyphher stents and two 2.5x12mm overlapping Taxus stensts were
placed. This revealec mid LAD lesion that was underappreciated.
Pt had CP/nausea, 2mm ST elevations in inferior leads, became
bradycardic and was given atropine and dopamine. Flow in LAD/LCX
normal/no dissection.
2. RCA was stented with 2.5x18mm Cypher stent - no residual,
TIMI 3. 3. Mid LAD 2.5x8 cm Cypher stent with no residuaa and
TIMI 3.

EKG (post-cath at OSH): rate 80, sinus, nl axis, nl intervals,
no ischemic ST or TW changes, Q in III, aVF.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 52 yo patient of Dr.[**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], with history of silent MI in
[**2145**], diabetes mellitus, Hypertension, known 2 vessel [**Hospital **]
transferred from the OSH which was intervened.
Patient has 2 vessel CAD s/p three stents to LAD and a stent to
RCA complicated by MI. Patient was found to have in stent
thrombosis of LAD stent [**2147-4-15**] which was intervened upon after
resuscitation in the cath lab. She had polymorphic VT while in
cath lab.
She was subsequently transferred to the CCU with intraaortic
balloon pump support and was on bivalirudin due to question of
heparin induced thrombocytopenia. She was eventually stable
enough to be weaned off balloon pump and dobutamine. She was
continued on aspirin, lipitor. Her plavix was switched to
ticlopidine since she developed in stent thrombosis while on
plavix. Captopril was eventually started as her blood pressure
tolerated it. Beta blocker was held as she has severe
bronchospasm. She remained in normal sinus rhythm throughout CCU
stay. On the day of her death, she developed respiratory
distress and ventricular fibrillation. Resuscitation effort was
attempted without success.
