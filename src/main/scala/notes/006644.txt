Chief Complaint:
Chest pain/Dyspnea on exertion

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2157-7-20**] Aortic Valve Replacement (19mm Pericardial tissue valve)

History of Present Illness:
72 y/o female who developed chest pain and shortness of breath
in [**2157-5-24**]. She was admitted to OSH and r/o for an MI. She
was medically managed and underwent an echo and cath. Echo
showed severe aortic stenosis and moderate insufficiency. Cath
revealed similar valvular disease along with no coronary
disease. Referred for surgical management.

Past Medical History:
Aortic Valve Stenosis and Insufficiency, Congestive heart
failure, Hypertension, Hyperlipidemia, Congenital Complete heart
block s/p PPM [**2111**], Apical LV thrombus, Peptic ulcer disease,

Chest: CTAB
Heart: RRR 3/6 SEM

Ext: Warm, well-perfused, trace edema
Neuro: A&O x 3, MAE, non-focal

Pertinent Results:
[**2157-7-20**] Echo: PRE-BYPASS: 1. No atrial septal defect is seen by
2D or color Doppler. 2. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. There
is moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
septal and inferior apical hypokinesis. However, due to
suboptimal views other regional MWAs cannot be ruled out. No
apical LV aneurysm is seen. No masses or thrombi are seen in the
left ventricle. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
mildly depressed (LVEF= 40 %). 3. Right ventricular chamber size
and free wall motion are normal. 4. There are simple atheroma in
the aortic arch. There are simple atheroma in the descending
thoracic aorta. 5. There are three aortic valve leaflets. The
aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is severe
aortic valve stenosis (area <0.8cm2). Mild to moderate ([**11-24**]+)
aortic regurgitation is seen. 6. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
POST-BYPASS: For the post-bypass study, the patient was
receiving vasoactive infusions including phenylephrine and AV
pacing. 1 Bioprosthesis is well seated in the Aortic position. A
mild paravalvular leak is noted originating near the right
coronary cusp location and directed eccentrically to the left.
This did not change significantly in severity after protamine.
2. LV function is unchanged. 3. Aorta is intact post
decannulation. 4. Other findings are unchanged.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 7474**] was admitted one day prior to surgery d/t being on
Coumadin for an Apical LV thrombus. She was started on Heparin
upon admission and underwent usual pre-operative work-up. On
[**7-20**] she was brought to the operating room where she underwent
an Aortic valve replacement. Please see operative report for
surgical details. Following surgery she was transferred to the
CVICU for invasive monitoring in stable condition. Later on op
day she was weaned from sedation, awoke neurologically intact
and extubated. Chest tubes were removed on post-op day one. She
was started on beta blockers and diuretics and gently diuresed
towards her pre-op weight. Also on post-op day one her pacemaker
was interrogated by EP and she was transferred to the telemetry
floor for further care. An intraoperative TEE showed that there
was no LV thrombus, so her Coumadin was discontinued.  On [**7-24**] she noted fatigue. Her bloodwork from that am showed that
her HCT was 21.7.  She was transfused one unit of packed red
blood cells with improvement of symptoms and her HCT rose to
27.3.  Throughout her post-operative course she continued to
experience "[**9-2**]" chest pain along her ribcage bilaterally. Was
worse with inspiration. She stated it was "held at bay" with
Ibuprofen and Dialudid. EKG was unchanged and she was able to
ambulate without worsening of pain. Physical therapy evaluated
and felt she was appropriate to d/c home.
