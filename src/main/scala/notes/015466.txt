IDENTIFICATION/CHIEF COMPLAINT:  This is a 59-year-old female
with a history of end stage renal disease, status post living
related kidney donor transplant in [**2190**].  She developed
subsequent graft rejection in [**2197-5-21**] and had another
kidney transplant on [**2197-6-7**].  The patient presented to the
hypoxia.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Status post living related kidney transplant.
2.  Atrial fibrillation with previous failed attempts at
cardioversion times two.
3.  Status post parathyroidectomy.
ALLERGIES:  The patient had allergies to penicillin, sulfa,
iodine and intravenous Valium.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient was discharged home
following her second kidney transplant, which had been
performed on [**2197-6-7**], and had been doing fairly well until
she presented with abdominal pain and anemia on [**2197-6-24**].  At
that time, she was admitted for one day and a CT scan was
done, which was unremarkable.  The patient was discharged in
reasonable condition at that time.

On [**2197-6-26**], the patient was readmitted to the hospital in
the medical intensive care unit after the onset of marked
dyspnea as well as dysuria, abdominal pain and diarrhea.  She
also commented on the presence of chills.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On examination, the patient was noted
to be tachycardic and in atrial fibrillation with a heart
rate of 122.  She had a blood pressure of 116/69 and a
temperature of 103??????F.  The head and neck examination was
unremarkable.  The cardiovascular examination demonstrated a
regular rate and rhythm and was otherwise unremarkable.  The
pulmonary examination demonstrated that the patient had
decreased breath sounds on the left and bilateral crackles a
third of the way up her chest.  The abdominal examination was
unremarkable.  However, the patient did have some slight
drainage from her incision site.  The extremities were noted
to have 1+ edema.

LABORATORY INVESTIGATIONS:  The CBC demonstrated a white
blood cell count of 11,800 with a hematocrit of 34.5 and
platelet count of 467,000.  INR was elevated at 2.8 secondary
to her anticoagulation with Coumadin.  Urinalysis was
unremarkable.  Electrolytes were notable for a BUN of 19 and
creatinine of 1.3.

ELECTROCARDIOGRAM:  The electrocardiogram demonstrated that
the patient was in atrial fibrillation.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was found to have an
enterococcal bacteremia with an unidentified source.  She had
negative urine cultures and no evidence of pneumonia.  The
patient underwent an ultrasound of the abdomen to look for a
perinephric abscess.  She also underwent a transesophageal
echocardiogram on [**2197-6-28**] to look for evidence of
endocarditis, which was also negative; however, the patient
was found to have moderate to severe mitral regurgitation
with an ejection fraction of 40%.

The patient was treated with vancomycin and gentamicin for
her bacteremia.  The infectious disease service and the
transplant service were both consulted for the patient's
care.

The patient converted back to sinus rhythm on [**2197-6-28**].  She
had a PICC line placed for her continued need for long-term
antibiotic treatment.  She improved with her antibiotic
treatment.

DISPOSITION:  On [**2197-7-1**], the patient was discharged home
with home nursing for continued antibiotic treatment.

It is unclear why this was not followed.
