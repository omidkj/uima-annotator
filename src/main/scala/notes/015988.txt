Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2160**]
Chief Complaint:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 77 y/o male with history of a-fib on coumadin
with a history of falls.  He fell on [**2150-4-11**] striking the back
of
his head with laceration, but no loss of consciousness.  On
[**2150-4-13**] he noted increased headaches with subsequent nausea and
vomiting.  Family noted that he became more confused, and he was
taken to outside hospital for evaluation.  Head CT at OSH
revealed approximately 5 x 3 cm right parietal/temporal
intraparenchymal hemorrhage with associated 5 mm of midline
shift.  Approximately 5mm right frontal parietal subdural
hematoma is also noted with 3 mm falcine subdural hematoma as
well.  At OSH the patient was noted to be confused but following
commands with all 4 extremities.  He also demonstrated slight
weakness in left upper extremity.  Upon admission to [**Hospital1 18**] ER,
he
was intubated, sedated, and paralyzed.


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
craniotomy to evacuate subdural hematoma
thoracentesis
intubation/extubation
PEG placement

   URINE CULTURE (Final [**2150-5-2**]):    NO GROWTH.

[**2150-4-13**] CT HEAD:
IMPRESSION:
1. 8.3 x 2.8 cm right parietooccipital intraparenchymal
hemorrhage with surrounding vasogenic edema.
2. Subdural hematoma along the right frontoparietal convexity,
falx, and right tentorium.
3. 3.2 x 1.8 cm right parietooccipital extra-axial hyperdense
fluid collection concerning for epidural hematoma.
4. Subfalcine herniation, effacement of the right frontal sulci
and mass effect over the right lateral ventricle with
compression of the occipital [**Doctor Last Name 534**].
5. Intraventricular hemorrhage.
NOTE ON ATTENDING REVIEW:
1. There is also mild mass effect on the right ambient cistern
(series 2, im 13).
2. Dedicated bone algorith images are not available but on the
visualized images, no obvious fractures are noted.
3. A small focus of hemorrhage is also noted in the cerebral
aqueduct. ( series 2, im 12)

[**2150-4-14**] CT C-SPINE:
IMPRESSION:
1. Fracture of ossified anterior longitudinal ligament at the
C3-4 level. High-density material in the anterior spinal canal
at the C2 through C4 levels may represent small epidural
hemorrhage versus the posterior longitudinal ligament. Fractures
through fused osteophytes cannot be excluded at other levels and
MR is recommended to evaluate extent of injury.
2. Ossified posterior longitudinal ligament at C6-C7 level
causes canal narrowing. CT is not able to provide intrathecal
detail compared to MR; MR is recommended for evaluation of
spinal cord injury if clinically indicated.
3. Limited views through the base of the skull demonstrate
increase size of known right intraparenchymal hemorrhage, left
intraventricular hemorrhage, and hemorrhage within the aqueduct,
as compared to CT head performed 11 hours earlier.

[**2150-4-14**] MRI C-SPINE:
IMPRESSION:
1. Increased signal in anterior disc at the C4-5 level
consistent with injury of this disc and likely injury of the ALL
at this level.
2. Increased signal throughout the intervertebral disc at C6-7
and in the prevertebral soft tissue at this level consistent
with injury to this disc and likely to the ALL, with protrusion
of this disc posteriorly. Also likely injury to the PLL at this
level.
3. DISH along the cervical spine, without evidence of bony
fracture or parivertebral hematoma.

[**2150-4-15**] CT HEAD:
IMPRESSION:
1. Right temporoparietal occipital hemorrhagic contusion
unchanged. Stable right subdural and epidural hematoma. Interval
increase in intraventricular hemorrhage in left occipital [**Doctor Last Name 534**].
2. Subfalcine herniation, effacement of right hemispheric sulci,
and mass effect on the right lateral ventricle, unchanged. No
evidence of uncal herniation.

[**2150-4-15**] EEG:
IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal portable EEG due to the abnormal

background consisting of low voltage, disorganized, and slow
activity
