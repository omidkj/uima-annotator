stable.  He is an obese male in no apparent distress.  Head,
eyes, ears, nose and throat is normocephalic, atraumatic.
Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light and
accommodation.  Extraocular movements intact.  Neck supple
with no bruits.  His cardiac exam is regular rate and rhythm.
3/6 systolic ejection murmur at the base.  Pulmonary: Lungs
clear to auscultation.  Abdomen is obese, nondistended,
nontender.  Bowel sounds present.  Extremities:  He had
bilateral lower extremity edema, 2+ and scattered throughout
his extremities.  His distal pulses were 2+.  Neurological
exam was nonfocal.

On admission his electrocardiogram showed increased ST
segment in V1 through V4 that were old.  Flipped T's in 1 to
V6, left ventricular hypertrophy was unchanged.

He was admitted to the medical service, question of
congestive heart failure and was taken for cardiac
catheterization.  He was found to have significant congestive
heart failure with aortic stenosis.  Coronaries were found to
be normal on catheterization.

He was taken to the operating room for an aortic valve
replacement on [**2194-9-30**].  He had an AVR [**17**] mm pericardial
valve and did well.  He was transferred to the PSRU
postoperatively where he was extubated and he continued to
improve.

Physical therapy was consulted for ambulation and for
mobility.   Felt he might be able to be discharged home,
first there is a question of being discharged rehabilitation.
If he were to be discharged home he would require home
physical therapy.  Postoperatively his Foley was removed.  He

his chest tube and wires at that time.  He was started on
Haldol.  He also pulled out his Foley which required
replacement due to blood and lack of ability to urinate.  His
venous access was poor postoperatively and he developed rapid
atrial fibrillation at the time he had venous access
therefore, he was started on Lopressor intravenous as well as
Amiodarone load and he resolved, his rate control was better
and over time he was switched to sinus rhythm.  He was
started on Heparin on [**2194-10-3**] with the goal PTT of 50 to 70.
However his loss of intravenous access and conversion to
sinus rhythm, his Heparin was discontinued.  He was continued
on Coumadin.  [**Female First Name (un) 3408**] Diabetes Center was consulted for

time he was being considered to increase his
Carbidopa/Methidopa dose to one tab p.o. three times a day.

2.  KCL 20 mEq p.o. b.i.d.
3.  Aspirin 325 mg p.o. q day.
4.  Colchicine 0.6 mg p.o. b.i.d.
5.  Metoprazole 40 mg p.o. b.i.d.

7.  Lopressor 25 mg p.o. b.i.d.
8.  Amiodarone 400 mg p.o. q day.

intervals.

The patient is discharged to rehabilitation in stable
