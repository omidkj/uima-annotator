Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Levofloxacin

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4891**]
Chief Complaint:
shortness of breath, with acute respiratory distress

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Endotracheal intubation, subsequent extubation


History of Present Illness:
87 y/o M with hx of dCHF, HTN, HL, COPD and recent CVA who is
presenting with acute worsening of several days of dyspnea. Of
note, the patient's wife died in the week prior to admission,
and per report, he went to his PCP who noticed he wasn't taking
very good care of himself. He prescribed benzos for presumed
anxiety due to the recent death. He has been intermittently
complaining of "flu-like" symptoms with cough, low grade fevers,
some shortness of breath to his family. Today his family went to
visit and he was weak and lethargic and then developed acute
shortness of breath that was very different from the last few
days. His daughter said she could hear audible wheezing. EMS was
called, and his BPs were noted to be in the 200s. His RR was in
the 40s and he was placed on EMS CPAP. He received 2 SLNG en
route.
.
In the ED, inital vitals were 99.7, 94, 142/90, 32 and 89% on
cpap. He was given nitro gtt, solumedrol, albuterol and
azithromycin/ceftriaxone. He also received lorazepam for some
anxiety as he was aggitated and pulling at his mask. He did have
a fever in the ED, received tylenol for the fever. He is
currently on BiPAP.
.
On arrival to the floor, he is somnulent, not answering
question. He barely moved while having an ABG. He does awak to
loud voice and touch. He is breathing at a normal rate and seems
to be tolerating the BiPAP mask well. He was subsequently
admitted to the ICU, and later transferred back to the medical
service.

Blood and urine cultures: negative
.
IMAGING:
[**3-28**] CXR:
Mild pulmonary edema with a more confluent opacity in the right
lower lobe
which may represent pneumonia. Repeat radiographs after
treatment of
pulmonary edema could be useful.
.
CT-A
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
2. Moderately extensive bibasilar pneumonia with less extensive
right upper
lobe consolidation. Given the dependent location of these
consolidations,
aspiration is a possibility.
3. Emphysema and evidence of pulmonary arterial hypertension.

On discharge:
Cdiff toxin positive on [**4-8**].
WBC decr to 14.6K on day of discharge.


Brief Hospital Course:
87 y/o M with hx of dCHF, COPD, and PBC who presented with acute
respiratory decompensation.  The cause was new pneumonia leading
to COPD exaccerbation.  Also had mild component of dCHF.  He was
in the ICU and intubated.  He did well with intubation, was
subsequently extubated without complications and improving.

# Hypercarbic respiratory failure:
Multifactorial from COPD flare and presumed pneumonia, as well
as underlying CHF.  He initially presented and was somnulent.
He was placed on bipap and his pCO2 improved.  He was on and off
bipap over three days with treatment of pna, copd and his dCHF.
On the third day, he had acute hypoxemia after a turn and was
intubated briefly and transferred to the ICU.  He had a CTA to
rule out PE which was negative.  He was treated for empirical
coverage of hospital-acquired pneumonia with vanco, cefepime and
azithro.  He completed his course in the hospital and was
transferred from the ICU to the medical floor after extubation.
He was on high dose steroids for 7 days with a tapered plan.
The taper started from going to 60 mg pred to 50 mg pred with a
plan for 10 mg decrease in dose every three days. We also
started spiriva for his COPD, in addition to prn nebulizers.

# Acute diastolic CHF exacerbation: He was diuresed during the
ICU portion of his course, for acute CHF which developed
following volume resuscitation.  Once his dry weight was
achieved, we restarted him on half his recent home dose of lasix
at 40 mg daily, which was stable for several days prior to
discharge and kept the patient euvolemic. The patient's
lisinopril was increased to 20 mg daily.  He was euvolemic on
discharge and stable on room air at rest.  He should be
monitored as an outpatient and see if he requires adjustments to
his outpatient diuretic regimen.  .
# Pneumonia: s/p treatment as above with 8 days vanco/cefepime
and 5 days of azithromycin.
.
# C diff:  He developed a new leukocytosis on [**2143-4-6**], with time
course inconsistent with steroid response given that he was on a
taper at that time.  UA and CXR unconcerning for infection;
blood cx NGTD at time of discharge.  Although he did not have
diarrhea or severe abdominal symptoms, C diff was suspected
given recent antibiotic use.  He tested positive for C diff and
was started on PO flagyl.  A baseline KUB was obtained and
showed evidence of stool without concern for toxic megacolon,
but did show significant stool in the colon.  He remained
afebrile and his white count trended down, and we suggested
continuing flagyl for 2 weeks total (starting on [**2143-4-8**]).
.
# HTN: Hypotensive initially, but never reqired pressors.  As
his BP recovered, was converted to captopril (given it was short
acting).
