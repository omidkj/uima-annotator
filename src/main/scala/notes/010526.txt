PCXR:  Apparent interval improvement in the degree of pulmonary
congestion.  Cardiomegaly is stable.

EKG: A fib w VR controlled, PVC, nl axis. No signi change since
[**6-29**].

[**2184-8-15**] CT head: There is no evidence of infarctin, hemorrhage,
mass effect, shift of normally midline structures or
hydrocephalus. There has been no change since the prior study.
The ventricles and sulci are prominent consistent with
age-related involutional change. No definite osseous
abnormalities are appreciated. There are no air-fluid levels
within the paranasal sinuses. The mastoid air cells are
bilaterally poorly pneumatized. The middle ear cavities are
clear. The soft tissues appear unremarkable.

[**2184-8-15**] CTA chest:
1.  No evidence of central or segmental pulmonary embolism.
2.  Stable cardiomegaly.
3.  Mild increase in the size of the small bilateral pleural
effusions with associated atelectasis compared to the [**2184-6-26**] study.
4.  Patchy areas of increased lucency within both lungs, may
relate to air
trapping.

[**2184-8-18**] CXR: Possible new right pleural effusion. Evaluation
with standard PA and lateral radiograph would be recommended for
precise evaluation of these findings. Pulmonary hypertension.

[**2184-8-14**] RUQ US: Cholelithiasis, without evidence of acute
cholecystitis.

[**2184-8-28**]:
A comparison is made with the prior chest x-rays of [**Month (only) 359**] the
6th. Tracheostomy tube is again seen. A nasogastric tube is
present. The position of the left PICC line remains unaltered.

The heart is enlarged. Bilateral pleural effusions are present
and there is generally increased pulmonary plethora even
allowing for the supine position and I suspect the presence of
failure. Pneumonia less likely.
.
[**2184-8-28**] CXR:INDICATION: PICC line placement.
Repeat AP view of the chest is obtained [**2184-8-28**] at 18:20 hours
for PICC line placement and shows that the PICC line is within
the right atrium. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] discussed this with [**Doctor Last Name 7830**] and
advised a repeat film after repositioning.
