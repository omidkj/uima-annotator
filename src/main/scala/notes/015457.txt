Brief Hospital Course:
74 yo M w/ hx GERD a/w STEMI s/p 2 DES to LAD.  Post procedure
w/ persistent CP and STE w/ pericardial rub attributed to
evolving infarct.  Pt w/out integrillin post-cath [**1-18**] bleeding
at groin [**1-18**] ? arterial tract.

*
CARDIAC:
.
A) Cor: Pt found to have totally occluded LAD on cath, 2 DES
placed with TIMI [**1-19**] flow (improved vascularization, but not
complete.  [**Name (NI) 2076**], pt developed persistent CP, with EKG
changes consistent with pericarditis.  Pt received NSAIDs for
pain relief with good response.  Post-cath anticoagulation was
held due to persistent groin bleeding.  Post-cath Echo showed EF
30% with 1+MR, HK of anterior and septal walls and AK of apex
with no evidence of aneurysm.  Patient was started on heparin,
with plan for discharge on coumadin for apical akinesis.
Patient was started on plavix, lipitor, and metoprolol.
Continued on ASA.
.
B) Pump: As above, EF 30% with wall motion abnormalities
post-cath.  The patient had baseline R LE edema [**1-18**] frequent hip
surgeries, but developed BL edema in setting of new heart
failure.  Also noted an increase in weight (190lbs at home -->
200lbs). Patient was diuresed with lasix 10mg IV with good
response, and was started on daily lasix 20mg PO.  ACEI was
initially held due to hypotension and concerns about rate
control requiring higher doses of metoprolol and ultimately
restarted on 5 lisinopril.
.
C) Rhythm: The patient was noted to have a 1st degree AV block,
with RBBB and LAFB that were seen on prior old EKGs.  About [**3-20**]
days post-cath he was noted to have paroxysms of atrial
tachycardia with regular rates of 150s, concerning for ectopic
atrial tachycardia vs re-entrant SA tachycardia.  He was rate
controlled with PO, then IV metoprolol.  He was seen by EP, who
planned on placing a PPM as well as an ICD, but was awaiting
resolution of diarrhea.  Ultimately, atrial ablations were
performed w/implntation of ICD.
*
DROP IN HCT: Most likely was in the setting of blood loss during
and immediately after cath.  Hct was stable following.
*
PULMONARY: Pt having snoring and episodes of apnea.
--Pt will need sleep study as OP
*
GI: Watery diarrhea, likely med related (Protonix and plavix are
two possible culprits) vs viral gastroenteritis.  Concern for
decreased absorption of PO meds as above. Ultimately, diarrhea
resolved.
*
DIABETES: Pt noted to have fasting blood glucoses > 126 on
several labs.  A1C was 6.1%.  Nutrition discussed diet
counselling with patient. Continued FS as part of patient
education.
*
GERD: Cont H2B, Maalox
*
FEN: Cardiac/HH/diabetic diet. Replete lytes.
*
PPX: Heparin gtt, H2B, Bowel regimen.
*
ACCESS: PIVs.
