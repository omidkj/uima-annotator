HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 67-year-old man
with a long cardiac history which includes coronary artery
bypass grafting in [**2141**], [**2146**] and [**2159**], associated with
congestive heart failure and an EF of 25-30%.  He has also
had a mitral valve replacement in the past, as well as an
AICD placement in [**Month (only) 116**] of this year.  He presented to the
[**Hospital 1474**] Hospital with complaint of [**Hospital **] and vomiting, as
well as increased abdominal girth.  He was found to be
hypotensive and was admitted to their ICU briefly requiring
pressors.  An echo at the [**Hospital 1474**] Hospital showed an EF of

temperature 97.4, heart rate 55, blood pressure 129/77,
respiratory rate 24, O2 sat 99% on room air.  General -
pleasant man, sitting upright, speaking in full sentences, in
no acute distress.  Skin - no jaundice or rashes.  HEENT -
anicteric, noninjected.  Pupils equally round and reactive to
light.  Extraocular movements intact.  Mucous membranes

lymphadenopathy.  Heart - irregularly irregular, III/VI
holosystolic murmur throughout.  Respiratory - a few
vesicular breath sound at bases, otherwise clear.  Abdomen
was distended, nontender, soft, with shifting dullness to
percussion, but no fluid wave transmission, no
hepatosplenomegaly, positive bowel sounds.  Extremities - 3+

LAB DATA:  White count 6.4, hematocrit 34.9, platelets 160,
PT 18.5, PTT 39.8, INR 2.3, sodium 138, potassium 4.3,
chloride 100, CO2 28, BUN 25, creatinine 1.3, ALT 16, AST 68,
LDH 994, alk phos 86, total bili 2.4, albumin 3.9.  EKG was
afib., paced irregularly with a rate of 63, with axis of
-68??????, [**Street Address(2) 1766**] elevations in V3, and [**Street Address(2) 4793**] elevation in V2
through 4.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was treated by the medical
service with consultation from heart failure service, as well
as cardiology.  The cardiac surgery service was consulted as
well.

The patient was diuresed over the first 10 days of his
hospitalization.  Following that period of time, the patient
was evaluated for heart transplant, as it was felt that he
may require an LVAT during his mitral valve replacement.

On the [**6-25**], the patient was brought to the cardiac
catheterization lab where an intra-aortic balloon pump was
placed prior to his being transferred to the operating room
for a redo mitral valve replacement.  Please see the
catheterization lab report for full details.  In summary, he
had an intra-aortic balloon pump placed prior to surgery.  He
was then brought directly to the surgical suite, at which
time he underwent redo mitral valve replacement with a #27
mosaic porcine valve via a right thoracotomy.  The patient
tolerated the operation and was transferred from the
operating room to the Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit.
Please see the OR report for full details and summary.

The patient was transferred, after redo MVR, with a mean
arterial pressure of 82.  He was V-paced at a rate of 80.
His IV medications included amiodarone at 2 mg/min,
epinephrine at 0.03 mcg/kg/min, milrinone at 0.5 mcg/kg/min,
Levophed at 0.15 mcg/kg/min, and propofol at 10 mcg/kg/min.
In the immediate postoperative period, the electrophysiology
service was consulted regarding ventricular ectopy.  At that
time, his internal pacer was increased to a rate of 90 in an
attempt to control his ventricular ectopy.  The patient did
well in the immediate postoperative period.

During the first 24 hours, epinephrine was weaned to off, and
his amiodarone was decreased to 1 mg/min.  On the morning of
postoperative day #1, the intra-aortic balloon pump was
weaned and ultimately discontinued.  During that period, the
patient remained hemodynamically stable.  Neurologically, the
patient's sedation was weaned to a point that he was able to
move all four extremities and nod appropriately following a
quick neuro assessment.  The patient was resedated therefore
requiring continued ventilatory support.  Following removal
of the intra-aortic balloon pump, the patient's Levophed was
weaned to off, and on postoperative day #2, the propofol was
discontinued, thereby allowing us to wean the patient from
the ventilator.  The patient was successfully extubated on
postoperative day #2.

Over the next several days, the patient was slowly weaned
from his milrinone infusion.  On postoperative day #5, the
milrinone was successfully discontinued.  Following the
successful discontinuation of the IV milrinone infusion, the
patient was transferred to Far-2 for continued postoperative
care and cardiac rehabilitation.  The patient remained on
Far-2 for an additional three days, during which time his
activity level was increased with the assistance of the
physical therapist and the nursing staff.  On postoperative
day #10, it was decided that the patient was stable and ready
to be discharged to home with the assistance of visiting
nurses.

DISCHARGE PHYSICAL EXAM:  Vital signs - temperature 98, heart
rate 70, V-paced, blood pressure 100/52, respiratory rate 20,
O2 sat 95% on room air, weight preoperatively 102 kg, and at
discharge 97.3 kg.  Alert and oriented x 3.  Moves all
extremities.  Follows commands.  Respiratory - breath sounds
