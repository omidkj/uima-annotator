Service:   Cardiothoracic  Surgery

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname 32226**] is a pleasant
64-year old gentleman who presented to [**Hospital1 **]
for a cardiac catheterization after an equivocal stress test.
His catheterization on [**2187-12-25**] showed left dominant
system with three vessel disease.  The left main had a distal
20% stenosis, mid LAD had 60-70% stenosis.  There was a 50%
distal LAD stenosis.  The circumflex was large with a tubular
70% stenosis of mid vessel and a long 70-80% stenosis before
the left PDA.  The first marginal had an 80% stenosis, the
left PDA was diffusely diseased.  RCA was non-dominant and
was totally occluded proximally.  The distal vessels filled
via left-sided collaterals.  The ventriculogram showed
severely reduced systolic function with an ejection fraction
of 30%.  There was global hypokinesis present with
inferoposterior basal segments reversed.  The valves were
normal.  Given this, Mr. [**Known lastname 32226**] was assessed to require a
coronary bypass as the best option for his care.  He elected
for this surgery after the risks and benefits were explained
to him and elected to have this done during this admission.

LABORATORY:

HOSPITAL COURSE:  He received a coronary bypass on [**2187-12-27**] with the following anatomy:
1.  LIMA to LAD.
2.  Vein to OM.
3.  Vein to distal circumflex.
4.  Vein to D2.

PDA was not grafted because it was too small.

Mr. [**Known lastname 32226**] was transferred to the CTICU for his
postoperative care and was transferred out without any
complications on postoperative day #2 to the floor.  During
his recovery, he was found to have a slight wobble with his
walk.  According to a family member, this was an exacerbation
of a condition that existed prior to the operation.  Given
this neurological change, a Neurology consult was obtained
for evaluation.  There was an initial question of a mid
cerebellar hypoperfusion, however over time as the patient
improved and his gait improved, as per Neurology, cerebellar
infarct was unlikely.  An MRI of the brain focusing on the
cerebellum is recommended and given that the patient is post
coronary bypass, it will be scheduled as an outpatient basis.
Mr. [**Known lastname 32226**] is ambulating with some assist, tolerating a
regular diet.  He is being transferred to rehabilitation for
further recuperation.  He is to follow up with Neurology
after his MRI with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 10102**] within a month and with his
primary care physician.  [**Name10 (NameIs) **] is also to follow up with
Cardiology.

Pertinent tests - Cardiac catheterization:  Low cardiac index
of 2.2 liters per minute per meter squared.  Left
ventriculography shows reduced systolic function with an
ejection fraction of 30%, and a global hypokinesis with
inferoposterior basal segments reversed.  There was no mitral
regurgitation.  Selective coronary arteriography shows left
dominant system with three vessel disease.  Left main has
distal 20% stenosis, mid LAD has 60-70% stenosis.  There is a
50% distal LAD stenosis.  The circumflex is large with a
tubular 70% stenosis of mid vessel and a 70-80% stenosis
before the left PDA.  The first marginal has an 80% stenosis.
The left PDA is diffusely diseased.  RCA is non-dominant and
totally occluded proximally.  The distal RCA fills via left
left-sided collateral.  In summary, Mr. [**Known lastname 32226**] has three
vessel coronary artery disease with moderate to severe
systolic and diastolic ventricular dysfunction and moderate
pulmonary hypertension.  This report is obtained prior to his
coronary bypass.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Good.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  To rehabilitation.


DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Coronary artery bypass graft.
