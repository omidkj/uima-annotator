atrial clot

Bronchoscopy


History of Present Illness:
HPI: This is a 38 year-old female with a history of non-small
cell lung carcinoma on study drug (protocol [**Numeric Identifier 68730**]--PI3 Kinase
inhibitor) since [**5-1**] who went for routine CT torso per study
drug protocol and was found to have a right atrial tumor
thrombus and right common iliac artery clot. Patient was called
by her oncologist and advised to go to the nearest ED. She first
went to [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 805**] and was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] since she
gets most of her care here. In our ED, patient was continued on
heparin gtt. Her initial vs were: T 98.1, HR 112, BP 115/75, R
20, O2 sat 93% 4 L NC (baseline). Her exam was notable for a
cool right lower extremity with dopplerable pulses, normal
strength and sensation. Vascular surgery was consulted and
recommended continuing the heparin gtt and monitoring her
neurovasc status overnight but did not think intervention was
necessary at this time given no symptoms and dopplerable pulses
on the right foot. IR was made aware of the patient and will see
patient in the am unless condition changes. Currently, patient's
vital signs on arrival to the ICU are P 101, BP 110/75, RR 24,
O2 sat 93% 4 L NC. She reports that she did notice some pain in
her right leg starting at the hip and radiating to her anterior
thigh over the last week. She usually has cold feet and has not
noticed one is more cold than the other. She denies dizziness,
LH, HA or CP. She does have DOE but has not noticed any change
from her baseline. She often coughs up blood-tinged sputum which
has not changed. Denies abd pain, nausea, vomiting, melena,
hematochezia, dysuria, difficulty ambulating, etc.

CT Torso W&W/O C Study Date of [**2196-8-18**] 11:03 AM
1. Sizeable filling defect in the left atrium, consistent with
tumor
thrombosis. Evidence of arterial thrombosis at the right common
iliac artery.
2. Stable, extensive and diffuse bilateral airspace
consolidation consistent with the bronchoalveolar cell cancer.
3. No abdominal or pelvic lymphadenopathy.
4. Interval resolution of the large right adnexal cyst.
Stable-appearing
small right adnexal cyst.

[**2196-8-22**] PROCEDURE:  Flexible bronchoscopy.
 A full airway survey was
performed down to the subsegmental bronchi. There were no
evidence of endobronchial lesions or evidence of recent or
old bleeding. There were no blood clots noted. Therapeutic
aspiration of clear thin secretions was performed mainly in
the right lower lobe but also in the left upper lobe as well.
There were no purulent secretions noted. The flexible
bronchoscope was removed. The patient was transferred to the
postprocedure holding area in stable condition.

Portable TTE (Complete) Done [**2196-8-23**] at 3:27:22 PM
The left atrium is normal in size. A nonmobile globular mass
(1.6 by 0.8 cm) is seen (in subcostal window only) projecting
into the body of the left atrium. Its attachment site is not
defined but may be in or around one of the right pulmonary
veins. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and
regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF 60%). Tissue
Doppler imaging suggests a normal left ventricular filling
pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). There is no ventricular septal defect.
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with
good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral
valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral
regurgitation. There is no mitral valve prolapse. There is
moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion. If clinically indicated, a transesophageal
echocardiographic examination is recommended to more clearly
define the apparent left atrial mass.
IMPRESSION: left atrial mass

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 38 year-old female with a history of non-small cell
lung cancer who presents with left atrial tumor thrombus and
right common iliac clot admitted to the ICU for frequent neuro
checks of cool extremity.
.
# Arterial thrombus: Patient has left atrial clot and right
common iliac clot. She had a cool distal extremity on the right
with dopplerable pulses. Vascular surgery consulted in the ED.
The patient was admitted to the ICU for monitoring and then
transferred to the OMED service. The patient was placed on a
heparin drip and transitioned to lovenox prior to discharge.  No
further intervention was made.
.
# Lung cancer: The patient had known metastatic NSCLC. The
patient was hypoxic but at her baseline home O2 requirement.
She was continued on cough suppressants and albuterol as needed
as well as vicodin for pain control.  She was discharged home
with VNA services and instructed to follow-up with her
hematologist.
.
# Hemoptysis:  Following initiation of heparin, the patient was
noted to have blood tinged sputum. A bronchoscopy was performed
which was without evidence of endotracheal bleed.  Her
hematocrit was stable and her symptoms improved.  No further
interventions were made.
.
# Tachycardia: The patient was noted to be tachycardic on
admission and this was felt to be due to her previously
documented atrial thrombus and hypoxia.  EKG was normal and
there was no JVD or muffled heart sounds to suggest tamponade.
She was monitored on telemetry without any events.  Echo
demonstrated the left atrial mass which appeared to originate
from the pulmonary vessels.  CT surgery was aware of the patient
and felt given the extent of her disease, surgical intervention
would not be of benefit.  The patient was stable upon discharge
and was to return for a follow-up ECHO in [**2-28**] weeks.
