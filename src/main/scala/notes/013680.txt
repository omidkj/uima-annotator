History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 83296**] is an 80 year old gentleman with a PMH significant
for DM 2, HTN, afib, CHF, and emphysema admitted to the MICU for
gallstone pancratitis and renal failure.  The patient was
transferred from the OSH after developing acute abdominal pain
last night.  This was associated with 4 episodes of NBNB emesis
and shortness of breath.  At the OSH, labs were notable for
lipase of 3353 and Tbili of 2.1.  CT demonstrated multiple
gallstones, a dilated CBD, and a stone in the ampulla.  The
patient was then transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] for surgical and ERCP
evaluation.
.
In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, VS 97.4 68 134/75 18 94%2L nc.  Patient
underwent an additional CTAP confirming a stone in the ampulla
and a dilated CBD, received 2L NS IVF, and pain medications. He
also received 4 units FFP for an INR of 2.3 and was evaluated by
surgery and ERCP with plan for ERCP.  He was then transferred to
the MICU for further management.
.
Upon admission to the MICU, he is resting comfortably without
complaints. States that his abdominal pain is well controlled.
Denies any CP/SOB, f/c/s, n/v/d, orthopnea, PND, or increased
lower extremity swelling.

CTAP:
1. Multiple gallstones and choledocholithiasis with dilatation
of the common bile duct up to 1.3 cm. In the appropriate
clinical setting, these findings raise concern for gallstone
pancreatitis. No evidence of acute cholecystitis.
2. Fatty liver.
3. Multiple bilateral cystic renal lesions measuring up to 4.4
cm. Recommend non- emergent ultrasound for further evaluation.
.
ECG: afib, RBBB.

Brief Hospital Course:
#Gallstone pancreatitis: Upon admission to [**Hospital1 18**], the patient
was urgenly taken to ERCP.  A sphincterotomy was performed and
[**5-11**] irregular black pigmented stones were removed from the
biliary tree.  A large amount of biliary sludge was visualized.
Following the procedure, the patient improved dramatically with
a decrease in liver function tests and pancreatic enzymes.  The
patient was kept NPO and hydrated with IVF until he was free of
pain.  Ins and outs were carefully monitored as the patient had
a history of congestive heart failure.  The patient started a
seven day course of ciprofloxacin and flagyl

# Renal failure: The patient presented with an elevated BUN and
creatinine, representing acute on chronic kidney failure
secondary to dehydration.  Serial renal function tests were
monitored with eventual return to the patient's baseline
creatinine of around 3.0 (as per patient's primary care
physician).

# Respiratory distress: The patient initially failed extubation
following ERCP.  Respiratory failure was likely multi-factorial
including sedation, obstructive disease due to COPD, and
possible pulmonary edema (hx. of CHF compounded by 3rd spacing
of pancreatitis).   As there is no prior CXR available for
comparison, it was difficult to assess whether the patient has
another contributing underlying pulmonary process.  Pulmonary
function improved and the patient was extubated without
incident.  Pulmonary toilet was encouraged with incentive
spironmetry.  The patient received ipratropium and  albuterol as
needed.

#Hypernatremia/ hyperchloremia: Patient developed mild
hypernatremia due to fluid administration.  Once the patient's
diet was advanced, the hypernatremia resolved

# DM 2: The patient's oral hypoglycemic medications were
initially held while the patient was kept NPO.  He remained
normoglycemic with sliding scale insulin.

# HTN: Patient's blood pressure remained stable with home dose
of metoprolol

# Afib: on longterm anticoagulation, coumadin held for ERCP.
Patient restarted coumadin when INR become sub-therapeutic.
Rate was adequately controlled with AV nodal blockade on home
metoprolol.
He was transferred out of the ICU on [**2188-8-9**]. After his
pancreatic enzymes normalized, he was given a clear liquid diet
and tolerated this without issue. On [**2188-8-10**], he was advanced to
a regular diet and tolerated this without issue. He looked very
well, and was pain-free. He was therefore discharged home with
instructions to follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] within the next 2
weeks for interval cholecystectomy. He is to complete a 7-day
course of antibiotics in the interim.
