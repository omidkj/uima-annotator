History of Present Illness:
This is a 56 year old gentleman s/p bioprosthetic valve
replacement 4 yrs ago, IVDA/alcohol abuse, transferred from
[**Hospital6 **] yesterday evening after he was found to
have aortic valve abscess, for surgical intervention. He was
apparently at his baseline until [**2104-4-8**] when he developed
shortness of breath and orthopnea, and was admitted to the
hospital with diagnosis of volume overload vs pneumonia. He was
treated with iv diuretics. BP mostly in low 100s. He is not
aware of any low blood pressures. Blood cultures grew coag neg
staph [**3-13**], and he was treated with vancomycin. TEE done in OSH,
showed aortic valve abscess extending to aortic root and
ascending aorta, but no fistula. He was started on rifampin and
transferred to [**Hospital1 **] for surgical intervention. 2D echo showed EF
of 50-55 % with mild diastolic dysfunction and mild PAH with
pressures of 35.  According to him, he was first told of some
kidney dysfunction almost 1.5 yrs ago, however he has not been
following up with any nephrologist. According to records, he did
have [**Last Name (un) **] requiring dialysis at the time of his initial valve
replacement. He is however not aware of it. He denies taking any
NSAIDs. He does not know if he has had proteinuria. He does
acknowledge that recently he has been told by ophthalmologist
that he has diabetic retinopathy. On admission, he denies any
shortness of breath, swelling in his lower extremities, cough,
sore throat or flu like symptoms. He does have low grade fever.
Denies any dysuria, hematuria, urinary urgency or frequency.
Denies having a foley catheter in OSH. Denies any chest pain or
palpitations.

Pertinent Results:
[**2104-4-18**] Cardiac Catheterization:
1. Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system
demonstrated no angiographically-apparent flow-limiting coronary
artery disease.  The LMCA was a short, patent vessel.  The LAD
had a 30% stenosis at the origin and a tubular 45% lesion after
the large D2.  The D2 itself had a 30% stenosis at the origin.
The LCx had a tiny OM1, a modest caliber OM2 with diffuse
plaquing distally, and a patent (large) OM3 and OM4.  The RCA
was a tortuous lesion in its middle aspect with a large RPDA. 2.
Limited resting hemodynamics revealed low-normal systemic
arterial pressures, with a central aortic pressure of 104/58,
mean 77 mmHg. 3. Left ventriculography was deferred.
.
[**2104-4-19**] Chest CT Scan:
1. Bibasilar pulmonary consolidations, which likely include an
atelectatic
component, but superimposed aspiration or infection cannot be
excluded.
2. Bilateral loculated pleural effusions with surrounding
hyperdense pleural thickening and calcification.
3. Ascending aortic aneurysmal dilation measuring up to 4.8 cm.
4. Marked cardiomegaly.
5. Right subclavian line terminating in the high right atrium.
.
[**2104-4-19**] Renal Ultrasound:
The right kidney measures 10.7 cm and left kidney measures 10.9
cm. There is no evidence of hydronephrosis, renal masses, or
nephrolithiasis bilaterally.  The corticomedullary
differentiation is well preserved. The renal parenchyma is
normal in echotexture and vascularity. Bilateral renal arteries
are patent with appropriate arterial waveforms. Mildly elevated
RI up to 0.85 are noted, however there is no consistent evidence
of tardus parvus to suggest renal artery stenosis. Although a
few waveforms may appear slightly blunted, others show swift
upstrokes bilaterally. Main renal veins are patent.
.
[**2104-4-19**] Abdominal Ultrasound:
There is a 3 x 2.8 cm hypoechoic lesion in the posterior left
lobe of the liver, which is incompletely evaluated and of
indeterminate etiology. The main portal vein is patent with
hepatopetal flow. There is no intra- or extra-hepatic biliary
ductal dilation. The gallbladder is normal without evidence of
stones. The spleen measures 11.3 cm, within normal limits. The
aorta is of normal caliber in the visualized portions. The
visualized portions of the inferior vena cava are unremarkable.
No ascites is detected.
.
[**2104-4-21**] Intraop TEE:
Pre-CPB:
There is a wire from the ICD/Pacer which is associated with a
great deal of thickened material and is possibly adherent to the
tricuspid valve. The first step in the operation was to remove
the wire, which left 1 - 2+ TR.
No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the left atrial
appendage.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF
50-55%). with mild inferior hypokinesis.
There is mild global free wall hypokinesis.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
Motion of the aortic valve prosthesis leaflets is abnormal.
There is a minimally increased gradient consistent with minimal
aortic valve stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. There
is a .8 x .8 cm mass on the prosthetic valve at the commissure
of the left and right leaflets, though it seems mainly attached
to the left.
The aortic root, especially off the left cusp, has an abnormal
echogenicity and is likely the residual material of an abscess.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial mitral
regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.

Post-CPB:
The patient is on low-dose epinephrine and phenylephrine, and is
in sinus rhythm.
There is an aortic homograft in place with no AI, no leak and a
residual peak gradient of 6 mmHg.
Trivial MR. TR remains 1 - 2+.
Biventricular systolic fxn is unchanged.
.
[**2104-4-22**] Head CT Scan:
There is an approximately 1.9 x 2.8 x 3.0 cm area of
intraparenchymal hemorrhage in the left occipital lobe with
surrounding edema. There is no significant mass effect or shift
of normally midline structures.  There is no intraventricular
extension. There is no uncal or transtentorial herniation. There
is no hydrocephalus. The ventricles and sulci are prominent,
consistent with atrophy, more than expected for stated age.
There is a small calcification in the left parietal lobe that
either represents a granuloma or vascular calcification. No
evidence of large acute vascular territorial infarction. No
fractures identified. Slightly prominent soft tissues over the
left parietal lobe. The visualized paranasal sinuses and mastoid
air cells are well aerated.
