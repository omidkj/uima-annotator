Brief Hospital Course:
Brief summary: 69 y.o male with hx of Etoh cirrhosis, CHF, and
DM presents from OSH with 6 weeks hx of recurrent r sided
pleural effusion and for possible TIPS placement. However,
thoracentesis on [**8-15**] with pleural fluid consistent with
exudates. Thorascopy on [**8-21**] for further evaluation but work up
so far negative for malignancy or infection. Had pleuradesis on
[**8-24**]. slightly hypoxic on [**8-25**] and cxr with increased right
pleural effusion, and had an episode of coffee ground emesis
([**8-26**]) associated with hypotension and dizziness- sent to MICU.
EGD showed varices and were banded. Repeated pleurosdesis on
[**8-29**] and stable post procedure with significant improvement in
O2 requirement and no evidence of shortness of breath.

MICU COURSE: Pt transferred to MICU s/p hypotensive episode. Pt
stablized BPs before endoscope. GI scope demonstrated stage 3
esophageal varices in the lower third of the esophagus, three
bands were placed. Scope also revealed several small nonbleeding
ulcers in stomach, as well as portal hypertensive gastropathy.
Pt remained stable during and after procedure.  On unit day #3,
pt underwent second pleurodesis due to continued large amount of
drainage from right sided chest tube. Procedure was tolerated
well except for a fever that night likely associated with the
inflammation of the pleurodesis itself.  Pt transferred back to
floor for continued management.

Post MICU course, BY PROBLEM:

1) R sided pleural effusion: Cytology from OSH shows no
malignant cells, few poly and no bacteria. Pt has hx of +PPD,
AFB and adenosine deaminase on cytology were negative so the
effusion was ruled out for tuberculous origin. Pt began to
reaccumulate fluid with removal of chest tube. He had stable
loculated effusion on chest xray. As he was not short of breath,
and was ambulating and saturating well, he did not require
further pleurodesis and was managed medically.  He did continue
have occasional low grade temperatures but these were felt to be
related to the inflammation of the pleurodesis.

2) Etoh Cirrhosis: Pt does demonstrate significant liver failure
with elevated INR and alb of 2.9.  U/S of liver [**8-17**] showed
normal portal flow. He was not felt to be a candidate for TIPS
procedure.  His diuretics were restarted after the resolution of
his hypotension.

3) CV: Hx of recent pacer placement. The patient had an echo
showing EF 50% and ?diastolic dysfunction. He was continued on
his cardiac medication regimen and there were no cardiac related
active issues.

5) Positive PPD: discussed with PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) **] symptoms, fluid at OSH
neg for AFB. [**Doctor First Name **] neg on [**8-24**].

6) Diabetes-He was followed by [**Last Name (un) **] for the management of
diabetes and did well on a regimen of repaglinide.
