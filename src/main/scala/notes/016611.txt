Service:  CME


SERVICE:  Coronary Care Unit

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 67 year old male
patient with a history of coronary artery disease,
hypertension, congestive heart failure with an ejection
fraction over 55 percent, status post coronary artery bypass
graft in [**2148**], aortic valve replacement in [**2148**] status post
redo in [**2151**], status post DDD pacemaker placement in [**2151**],
who presents with chest pain.  The patient reports developing
substernal chest pain with minimal movement since [**Month (only) 116**] when he
received a blood transfusion for hemoptysis.  Over the four
days prior to admission, the patient reports progressive
substernal chest pressure occurring at rest on the day of
admission.  The pain is described as nine out of ten and
radiating to his left arm, associated with shortness of
breath and nausea.  The patient denies lightheadedness or
palpitations.  He reports stable lower extremity edema.  The
patient's wife brought the patient to the Emergency
Department where the patient was noted to be hypertensive and
ruling in for an myocardial infarction.  In addition, the
patient's hematocrit was noted to be 24.0 with guaiac
positive stool.

Per the patient's wife, the patient had been taken off
aspirin and Plavix since [**2156-5-31**] secondary to "black
stool".  In addition, the patient's Coumadin dose had been
decreased by his primary care physician [**Name Initial (PRE) 767**] 3 mg to 2 mg q
h.s.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient previously worked as a truck
driver but is now on disability.  He is married with three
children.  He reports over 30 pack year smoking history but
quit smoking.  The patient reports minimal alcohol use.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 98.2 F.; blood pressure
158/70; heart rate 84; 100 percent on a 100 percent non
rebreather.  In general, laying in bed in mild distress.
HEENT:  Normocephalic, atraumatic.  Extraocular movements
intact.  Oropharynx is clear with moist mucous membranes.
Heart is regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 and a mechanical
S2.  Neck with no evidence of jugular venous distention.
Lungs are clear to auscultation with mild crackles in the
right lung base.  Abdomen with normoactive bowel sounds,
obese, nontender, nondistended.  Rectal:  Guaiac positive
stool per the Emergency Department.  Extremities with no
clubbing or cyanosis.  There is trace edema in the bilateral
lower extremities and skin findings consistent with chronic
venous stasis.  The patient has two plus dorsalis pedis
pulses, two plus femorals and no evidence of carotid bruits.

LABORATORY DATA:  White blood cell count 6.9. hematocrit
24.4, platelets 200, INR 1.6.  Sodium 139, potassium 4.4,
chloride 103, bicarbonate 21, BUN 38, creatinine 1.6, glucose
128.  CK 351, MB 8, troponin 0.16.

EKG paced at a rate of 96 beats per minute.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. NON-ST ELEVATION MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION:  As noted
   previously, the patient was admitted with a several day
   history of progressive substernal chest pressure in a
   setting of anemia and gastrointestinal bleed.  The patient
   was noted to have elevation in his cardiac enzymes to a
   peak CK of 351, a troponin of 0.35.  The etiology of the
   elevation in the patient's cardiac enzymes is considered
   likely secondary to demand ischemia versus a non-ST
   elevation myocardial infarction in the setting of a low
   hematocrit.

Given the patient's gastrointestinal bleed, he was evaluated
by the Gastroenterology Consult Service.  The patient was
continued on aspirin, Plavix, Lipitor and a beta blocker for
his coronary artery disease.  The patient's outpatient
cardiologist, Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 122**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], was contact[**Name (NI) **] regarding
workup for the patient's coronary artery disease.  The
decision was made to discharge the patient and have him
followup with an outpatient stress test three to four weeks
after discharge.

1. CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE:  The patient was evaluated with
   an echocardiogram which revealed an ejection fraction of
   30 percent, marked dilation of the left atrium, moderate
   dilation of the right atrium, and a moderately dilated
   left ventricular cavity with moderate to severe global
   left ventricular hypokinesis.  The patient exhibited no
   signs or symptoms consistent with congestive heart failure
   and was continued on his beta blocker and ACE inhibitor
   which were titrated as tolerated by the patient's heart
   rate and blood pressure.

1. RHYTHM:  The patient was monitored on telemetry throughout
   his hospitalization and on the day of discharge, had a 13
   beat run of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia.  The
   patient was asymptomatic with stable vital signs during
   this episode.  This nonsustained ventricular tachycardia
   is concerning for ischemia related changes.  It is
   anticipated that the patient will have a stress test as an
   outpatient with a possible revascularization procedure.
   The patient will also be followed by the Electrophysiology
   Cardiologist as an outpatient.

1. GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED:  As noted previously, the patient
   was admitted with a history of melena and noted to have a
   hematocrit of 24.0 on admission.  The patient was
   transfused five units of packed red blood cells throughout
   his admission.  The Gastroenterology consultation service
   was contact[**Name (NI) **] and performed an EGD on [**2156-6-7**], which
   was significant for likely nonsteroidal, anti-inflammatory
   associated gastropathy and duodenopathy with the most
   likely source of bleeding being the patient's gastritis.

The patient was continued on a proton pump inhibitor twice a
day throughout his hospitalization.  His melenotic stool
resolved throughout the remainder of his hospitalization and
he remained hemodynamically stable with a stable hematocrit.

1. STATUS POST AORTIC VALVE REPLACEMENT:  Once the patient
   was hemodynamically stable, Coumadin was restarted with a
   heparin drip.  The patient's INR was subtherapeutic until
   the day of discharge when it was 3.3.  It is anticipated
   that the patient will have his INR checked two days after
   discharge, the results of which will be sent to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
   in Cardiology who will titrate his Coumadin dose as
   necessary until the patient establishes care with a new
   primary care physician as an outpatient.

1. HYPOTHYROIDISM:  The patient was continued on his
   outpatient dose of Levoxyl.


CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Good.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  The patient is discharged to home with
close followup.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
