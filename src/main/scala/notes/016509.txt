Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 458**]
Chief Complaint:
lightheadedness

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
BiVentricular ICD palcement


History of Present Illness:
62-year-old man with a history of CAD (sirolimus-eluting stent
in LCx in [**2142**]), DM2, dyslipidemia who was transferred from
[**Hospital3 **] for EP study with planned ICD placement after
having polymorphic VT arrest.

The patient presented to [**Hospital3 **] on [**2147-1-5**] with a
complaint of lightheadedness x few weeks, at times associated
with dyspnea. No chest pain. He has chronic RBBB but developed
new LBBB and complete heart block at [**Hospital1 **]. The plan was to
have a DD pacemaker placed. On [**2147-1-7**] he had polymorphic VT
arrest, requiring defibrillation. Had temporary pacing wire
placed. Cardiac enzymes were negative. Also had mild CHF,
presumedly from heart block, with echo showing EF 30%, dilated
LV, and hypokinesis in apex, septum, anterior wall. Transferred
to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management with possible ICD placement.

On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
He denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other
review of systems were negative.

Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,
ankle edema, palpitations.

On arrival to the CCU, VSS, patient was talking pleasantly.

cavity. Severely depressed LVEF. No resting LVOT gradient. No
VSD.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV wall thickness. Normal RV chamber
size. Focal apical hypokinesis of RV free wall.

AORTA: Normal aortic diameter at the sinus level. Focal
calcifications in aortic root. Mildly dilated ascending aorta.
Focal calcifications in ascending aorta.

No AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. No MVP.
Mild mitral annular calcification. Mild thickening of mitral
valve chordae. Calcified tips of papillary muscles. No MS.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Mildly thickened tricuspid valve leaflets.
Normal tricuspid valve supporting structures. No TS. Physiologic
TR. Normal PA systolic pressure.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflet.
No PS. Physiologic PR. Normal main PA. No Doppler evidence for
PDA

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

Conclusions
The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are
normal. The left ventricular cavity is moderately dilated.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed
(LVEF= 20-30 %) secondary to akinesis of the interventricular
septum, anterior free wall, and apex. The inferior free wall is
also hypokinetic. The interventricular septum is thin and
fibrotic (scarred). There is no ventricular septal defect. Right
ventricular chamber size is normal. with focal hypokinesis of
the apical free wall. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral
valve prolapse. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is
normal. There is no pericardial effusion.
