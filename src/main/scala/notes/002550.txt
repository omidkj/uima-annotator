History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 39861**] is a 75M with history notable for metastatic prostate
cancer, HTN, CAD s/p recent stenting, severe AS, dCHF, heart
block s/p pacemaker, prior gastric ulcers, pancytopenia, and
prior anemia felt secondary to GI bleed who presented to [**Hospital1 **]
[**Location (un) 620**] on [**2179-5-20**] with abdominal pain and diarrhea.  For two
days prior to presentation, patient had constipation, but no
N/V.  Saw his PCP [**5-19**], and had KUB which was c/w constipation.
Was started on bowel regimen with colace and mag citrate, and on
the morning of [**2179-5-20**], woke up with fecal urgency and had
multiple large semi formed bowel movements.  After multiple
bowel movements, he was extremely fatigued prompting him to call
911.  In addition to his fecal urgency, he also complained of
worsening diffuse abdominal pain, worse with
palpation/manipulation.  He denied any melena, nausea or
vomiting.

He initially presented to [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**], where per report he had
guaic positive stools.  His labs were notable for Hct 28. plt
158, INR 1.1, Cr 1.3 (up from baseline 1), slightly elevated
Tbili 1.67. Lactate was 2.3.  While at [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**], the patient
was transferred to the ICU as his HCT decreased from 28 to 22
and he was oliguric. Rec'd transfusion. OF note, he remained
hemodynamcially stable   He underwent a CT abd/pelvis which
showed a multifocal small bowel abnormality with acute on
chronic inflammation, and of note there were some intervening
loops of small bowel that appeared normal, raising the question
of possible Crohn's.  He was also noted to have a large amount
of stranding in the left pelvic sidewall and left lower
retroperitoneum of the abdomen, indicating acute inflammation.
There was a distinct and abnormal portion of the sigmoid colon
suggestive of focal colitis, possibly ischemic.  He has
extensive atherosclerotic disease with moderate-severe narrowing
of the SMA and possibly the celiac, but [**Female First Name (un) 899**] patent.  Also of
note, he was found to have an isolated segment of peripheral
portal vein thrombus without more proximal thrombus.  CT scan
also raised concern for left common femoral artery
pseudoaneurysm that was not seen on [**5-12**] ultrasound.
He was evaluated by GI and surgery, who did not feel there was a
need for acute surgical intervention. Plan was to proceed with
conservative measures including fluid resusictation and
antibiotics.  Given rsk factors, GI didn not think he was a
cnadidate for an EGD or colonsocopy.  Per family's request, he
was transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.

Of note, the patient recently had multiple cardiac procedures,
including a DES to LAD in mid [**Month (only) 958**] by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], and a DES to
RCA in late [**Month (only) 958**] with a complication of a left groin hematoma
post procedure.  Additionally, given bradycardia and Wenkebach
rhythm, had a pacemaker placed on [**2179-5-5**].  Plans at that time
were to continue ASA and Plavix for minimum of one year.
Regarding his aortic stenosis, he was deemed high risk and
decision was made for valvulplasty at a later date.

On arrival to the ICU, patient is lethargic requesting fluids.
Complaining of moderate abdominal pain worse with manipulation.

Otherwise no other complaints.  States last bowel movement was
several hours ago.
