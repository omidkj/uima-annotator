[**Age over 90 **] yo Russian speaking female w/CML, diastolic CHF (EF > 55%),
afib, presented with symptoms of dizziness, found to be
hypotensive.
.
# Sepsis, source unclear, with bacteremia (group B strep) and
hypotension: Required pressors and 10 L volume repletion in the
ICU.  Stabilized and called out to the medical floor.  Blood
cultures positive for Group B strep, source unclear.  Initially
maintained on Vancomycin and Zosyn.  This was narrowed to
penicillin once the sensitivities returned.  In lenthy
discussion with patient, family, palliative care, pt. stated
repeatedly that she did not want any care that would prolong her
life.  On [**2100-11-1**], according to her wishes, abx. were stopped.
She was sent to [**Location (un) 582**] [**Hospital1 1501**] with Hospice care on [**2102-11-2**] in
stable contdition.  She was afebrile, with stable vital signs,
and tolerating some po liquids.
.
#Pain Control: In conjuction with the palliative care service,
the patient was given fentanyl patch, lidocaine patch, oral
dilaudid and tyelenol.  She was prescribed liquid morphine for
use in Hospice po, if she is unable to swallow the dilaudid
pills.
.
# Nausea - treated with oral ondansetron.
.
# ARF: felt due to ATN in the setting of hypotension from
sepsis.  Renal function recovered toward baseline by the end of
admission, but, given the patient's wishes for comfort only
care, no labs were at the end of her stay and renal function was
no longer monitored by serum cr. assay.
.
# Atrial Fibrillation: Chronic, not on coumadin.  BB initially
held in ICU given hypotension.  Resumed on medical floor as BP
stable, and in order to control RVR.
.
# CHF w/ diastolic dysfunction, chronic: Pt. was overall volume
overloaded, with intravascular depletion after ICU volume
rescussitation as above.  Given ARF, lasix was held; towards the
end of her hospitalization, once comfort only care was chosen,
lasix was not re-administered as she appeared to be
auto-diuresing, with large volumes of urine output, and her
respiratory status was stable.
.
# HTN: Hypotensive on admission. Will hold antihypertensives
until BP normalizes.
.
# CML - Pt. choses comfort only care, as above.  No further
treatment for CML.  Discharged to [**Location (un) 582**] with Hospice care, as
above.
