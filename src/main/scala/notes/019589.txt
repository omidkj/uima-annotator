History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 77 yo vietnamese woman w/ pmhx of CVA [**2098**], bladder
CA [**2100**] (w/ nl surveillance cystoscopies), anemia and asthma (no
PFTS) who p/w dyspnea. Patient lives in [**Hospital3 **] Manor Nursing
Home and was in her usual state of health until 4 days PTA when
she developed productive cough of white sputum (nonbloody) and
intermittent SOB. She denied fever, chills, N/D/V, palpatations.
Denied CP, PND, orthopnea, LE edema. In the nursing home she was
SOB w/ desat to 80s. No pleurisy. No recent travel. Positive
sick contacts at nursing home. She was diagnosed with asthma
just last year with no PFTS done. On theophyline, albuterol and
duonebs TID when she came in. She cannot quantify how often her
asthma flares are or what her triggers are. No history of TB or
exposure to TB. No history of exposures to asbestos. Cleaned
houses, never worked with chemicals in a lab. Never intubated.
She has been eating less recently because she has no appetite.
Can't quantify weight loss. Denies night sweats.

In the ED, patient was found to be hypertensive with sbp >190,
tacchycardic. NTG was initially given. Patient also had fever to
104, ? LLL opacity on CXR and lactate of 3.2. Therefore, pt
given high dose steroids (solumedrol at 125 mg)and empiric abx
coverage with vancomycin, levofloxacin and flagyl.

She was transferred to the ICU for treatment of asthma flare s/s
PNA and these antibiotics were continued until [**8-4**] when the
flagyl was discontinued because repeat CXR did not suggest PNA.
She was also treated with steroids, frequent nebulizer
treatments and chest PT. She required one night of bipap. Due to
steroid use, patient has had elevated blood sugars and has
therefore required NPH and RISS. Her white count has trended
down, fever has gone down and O2 sats maintained on O2 via NC
and pt was transferred to the floor.

On the floor, patient only complains of constipation and feeling
thirsty. She feels better than she did yesterday, but still
feels sob and has cough. Denies dizziness, headache, chest pain,
abdominal pain, N/V.

Brief Hospital Course:
AP: 77y/o Cantonese speaking AF with a PMH of bladder CA, CVA
and HTN who presented with fever and dyspnea.

1. Dyspnea-the patient was initially brought to the hospital for
desat to 80%, 4 days of cough, and fever. This was initially
thought to be due to an asthma flare secondary to pna  given the
elevated white count to 20, fever to 104 and LLL opacity on CXR.
She was initially treated for PNA with empiric vancomycin,
levofloxacin and flagyl. She was transferred to the ICU. The
patient was never intubated, but was put on shuffle mask and in
respiratory distress. Repeat CXR did not reveal LLL opacity and
therefore her cough and dyspnea was probably due to viral
bronchitis causing an asthma flare. At the nursing home, there
was an outbreak of unknown source and many residents had cough,
sob and fever. She was treated with IV solumedrol which was
converted to oral prednisone. She was also treated with
albuterol, atrovent, vancomycin and levofloxacin for 7 days. On
discharge, she is on prednisone taper, duonebs TID, vospire 4 mg
[**Hospital1 **]. No antibiotics on discharge. She is currently satting 97%
on RA. We did not continue theophylline. PCP can decide if he
feels this is necessary. Patient is satting fine without this
medication.
.
2. HTN- patient was on atenolol and HCTZ when she came to the
hospital. These medications were discontinued and she was
started on diltiazem. On the floor, we restarted her HCTZ and
atenolol. Due to high pressures, we increased her atenolol and
HCTZ.
.
3. Hyperglycemia- Patient does not have diabetes at baseline,
but has experienced hyperglycemia with the steroids she is
receiving for her asthma flare. We discharged her on NPH and
regular insulin sliding scale.
.
4. Depression- we continued prozac.
.
5. Anemia- Normocytic in nature with nl RDW. H and H on
admission was 12/34 and today on discharge is back to baseline.
We continued iron as per outpatient regimen. Stools in ICU were
guaic positive. [**Month (only) 116**] need outpatient EGD/colonoscopy.
.
7. Gastritis- EGD in [**4-27**] showed gastritis. We started
lansoprazole since Protonix could not be crushed.
.
8. H/O CVA- no active issues.
.
9. H/O bladder CA-last cystoscopy was normal in [**1-26**]. Needs next
cystoscopy in [**1-27**].
.
10. Psoriasis-no active issues.
.
11. Osteopenia-on CXR there were new thoracic vertebral
compression fracture, probably T9. We continued tums, vit D and
actonel.
.
12. FEN-bedside and video swallow done in hospital. Patient
aspirates with thin liquid and should be on nectar thick liquids
and puree food. Should crush pills.
