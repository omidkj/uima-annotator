Brief Hospital Course:
45 y/o female with recent hospitalization post pancreas
transplant for PNA/respiratory issues who now returns with RUQ
pain.
Due to recent concern for pneumonia and also apparent increased
work of breathing, she was given a CTA, which was negative for
pulmonary embolus.
Chest xray showed there is interval improvement of opacity at
the right lung base,
consistent with pneumonia. There is interval improvement in
retrocardiac
opacity, likely atelectasis. There is no pleural effusion, or
pneumothorax.
She received Vanco, Cipro and flagyl on admission, blood
cultures are negative to date.
She was seen in consult by both Interventional pulmonology and
the pulmonary services. They continue to recommend diuresis as
tolerated, and are not pursuing lung biopsy at this time. It is
noted that her splinting from the abdominal pain is limiting her
abiltiy to take full breaths.
Regarding her abdominal pain, upon admission a CT of the abdomen
was done showing distended cecum, ascending colon and transverse
colon with no obstruction or volvulus. However due to the
distention she received a course of neostigmine. Abdominal pain
was much improved over the course of the next few days however,
in addition she was having large volume of stool, but C diff was
negative, and this improved greatly by the day of discharge.
She was maintained on home immunosuppression regimen of 500 mg
Cellcept [**Hospital1 **] and Prograf 2 mg [**Hospital1 **] with levels around 7.
She is discharged to home back on lasix and continuing with home
O2, physical therapy to assist with reconditioning.
Also notable, her husband is out of town for one month starting
[**7-8**]. Patient was counseled about having someone with her, and
relying on outside supports with family in the area.
