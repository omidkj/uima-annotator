Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the TICU for management of her
injuries.  Ophthalmology and plastic surgery were consulted for
treatment of her facial lacerations and eye injuries.  Given the
results of the MRA, aspirin and plavix were started.  Cultures
were sent to identify the source of the patient's elevated WBC.
No antibiotics were started.  The cultures were pending at the
time of the patient's death.  A discussion was held with the
family on [**2195-11-29**] regarding the direction of future care. They
decided that the patient would be do not resuscitate, do not
reintubate if extubated.

The patient was to be extubated on [**2195-11-30**], but due to a lack
of gag reflex, she was kept intubated.  It was unclear whether
the patient had suffered a stroke from the lack of vertebral
artery blood flow.  Further workup of AMS was not pursued given
her poor prognosis and the desire of the family for minimal
intervention. On [**2195-12-1**], the patient's son made the patient
[**Name (NI) 3225**] and agreed to extubation.

The patient was extubated on [**2195-12-1**] and expired shortly
thereafter from cardiopulmonary arrest.
