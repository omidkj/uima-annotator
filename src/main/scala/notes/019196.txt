.
Echo [**2149-9-27**]: Left atrium is mildly dilated. There is severe
global left ventricular hypokinesis with apical and anterior
akinesis. Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely
depressed (20%). Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.

LUE U/S negative for DVT.

Stool culture negative for C diff.

Brief Hospital Course:
61 yo woman with h/o MM admitted with urosepsis.
.
1. Urosepsis:  Urine and blood cultures grew out E.coli
pansensitive except resistant to Bactrim.  Renal ultrasound was
negative for hydronephrosis.  The patient was initially treated
with Ceftriaxone and Vancomycin x 1 in the ED and Levaquin. Ms.
[**Known lastname **] was continued on Levaquin and later Ceftriaxone was added
for gram negative coverage. The sepsis protocol was intiated in
the ED and continued in the ICU with set goals of SvO2 >70, CVP
8-12, MAP >65. The patient's condition improved overnight with
fluids and antibiotics.  The patient was transferred to the
medical floor where she was afebrile with stable vital signs and
continued to receive ceftriaxone and levofloxacin until final
sensitivites returned, at which time she was changed to PO
levofloxacin only. She was sent home with PO levo to complete a
14 day course of therapy.
.
2. Acute SOB: In the ICU, the patient became acutely hypoxic and
tachy to 126 on the day after admission, and was put on a
non-rebreather with improvement. She was net positive 4L in the
unit, and CXR showed fluid overload.  She improved with IV Lasix
as well as verapamil. Bedside echo at that time showed EF of 20%
and severe global LV hypokinesis. We have no echos for
comparison so it is unknown whether this is a new decrease in EF
in setting of sepsis or whether this is secondary to some past
insult, for example the patient's past doxorubicin treatment.
Her fluid status was monitored on the floor and she received
Lasix once prn SOB with improvement and good output of urine.
On the day prior to admission the patient no longer required
oxygen supplementation and retainedgood O2 sats.  Per cardiology
recommendation, the patient should be followed with an
outpatient echo in [**1-26**] weeks and an outpatient cards follow up.

.
3. ARF: On admission the patient's Cr was 1.9, up from baseline
0.9. This likely represents prerenal failure, as the patient
appeared dry and responded to fluids by normalizing her
creatinine.  After large diuresis in the unit, urine lytes were
ordered, and patient did not have nephrotic-range proteinuria.

4. Multiple myeloma: Ms. [**Known lastname **] has had extensive treatment in
past w/ multiple recurrences - currently in remission, recent
SPEP/UPEP wnl, beta2microglobulin has been stable.  There was a
question of atypical cells seen on a blood smear here.  We held
off on repeat SPEP, UPEP given recent normal. The patient has a
follow up appointment with her oncologist at [**Hospital3 2576**]
Hospital in 2 weeks.
.
5. L arm swelling: On the day prior to discharge it was noted
that the patient's L arm was larger than the right. It was
nontender, however given the patient's history of DVTs and the
prior placement of IVs and blood draws in this arm during her
stay, [**Doctor Last Name **] u/s was ordered and was negative for DVT.

6. Diarrhea: on the day prior to discharge the patient
experienced several episode of "green" diarrhea, which was sent
for culture and was negative for C diff toxin.

7. The patient was full code and she expressed that her husband
should be her health care proxy should it become necessary.
