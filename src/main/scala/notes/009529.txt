Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 99**]
Chief Complaint:
Anemia and rising creatinine

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 75 year old male with type two diabetes mellitus,
coronary artery disease, peripheral vascular disease s/p
bilateral AKA and s/p cadaveric renal transplant on [**2120**] who was
admitted yesterday from [**Hospital **] clinic after being found to be
profoundly anemic and in ARF. On arrival to the ED he was found
to have a Hct of 17, while his prior baseline had been in the
30s, and he had been on procrit and Fe supplementation. He was
transfused 2 units and Hct increased to 25. Per medical record,
pt was guaiac negative in ED.
.
Patient may not be a completely reliable historian; to
nightfloat admitting, he complained of 1 month of decreased
appetite and intermittent lower abdominal pain, which was an
aching and mostly suprapubic pain. To medicine admitting intern,
he complained of one month of intermittent sharp LUQ abdominal
pain, but denied other pain. He complained of cough to one
examiner and was on robitussin but denied cough or other
respiratory symptoms for another. Per the renal transplant
fellow, his wife reports fatigue, weakness, decreased appetite,
some difficulty swallowing.
.
To the admitting day team medicine intern he reports
lightheadedness and his LUQ pain as his primary symptoms over
the last month.
.
To both admitting housestaff he denies any history of
constipation, hematemesis, emesis, bloody stools, melena. To
nightfloat he reports subjective weight loss, but is unable to
quantitate the amount or time interval. No fevers, chills or
nightsweats, or chest pain. The patient has no record of prior
colonoscopies or other GI studies.

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient was a 75 year old made admitted on [**2126-9-17**] due to
acute renal failure and low hematocrit of 17, and transfered to
MICU for respiratory distress, and continued acute renal
failure, after completion of upper endoscopy and transfusion of
three units of PRBC.  He was found to gram negative rod
pneumonia.  Patient had 15 day course of levofloxacin, and 3
days later, unfortunately developed recurrent sepsis.
.
# Sepsis: Patient had previously had an e. coli and citrobacter
pneumonia and had been treated with 15 days of levofloxacin
ending on [**2126-10-3**].  He then developed new fevers and
hypotension on [**2126-10-5**].  He had no leukocytosis, and sources
of his fever included a re-current pnuemonia, urinary tract
infection, line infection, C. difficile colitis, and acalculous
cholecystitis. It was also possible that it could have been
cardiac in nature, though repeat EKG showed no new findings
since admission; his cardiac enzymes bumped slightly, but this
was thought to be likely secondary to acute renal faliure.
Additionally, previous TTE showed adequate cardiac function.
- Vancomycin was re-started for MRSA coverage, Meropenem for
gram negative coverage as patient could have ESBL Klebs from
prolonged hospital stay, Flagyl to prophylactically treat C.
difficile.
- Cultures were drawn and followed.
- Stress dose steroids were re-started.
- Pressors were also re-started, and increased as needed,
initially Levophed, however neo and vasopressin were also
started.
Given the patient's recurrent sepsis and increasing pressor
requirements, the family decided to withdrawal care in
accordance with the patient's wishes, as he expressed to the
staff and his family that he did not want to continue on in his
current ventilator and pressor-dependent state. Patient was
maintained on pressors and the ventilator until his family
members were able to arrive from various parts of the country.
On [**2126-10-10**], care was withdrawn in accordance with the
patient's and wife's wishes, and he was extubated. The patient
passed away with his family at the bedside on the evening of
[**2126-10-10**].
.
# Respiratory Failure:  Patient was intubated upon arrival to
MICU for respiratory distress and altered mental status.
Initially thought to be due to volume overload in the setting of
RBC transfusions, further compromised by COPD caused either by
fluids, CHF or TRALI. The work-up for transfusion reaction was
negative  However, anaphalyxis, wegeners, PE, pneumonia and
sepsis could not be rulled out. LENI's demonstrated no DVTs, and
further CTA to evaluate for PE was held due to concern for ARF.
With further imaging, localized consolidation and bilateral
effusions suggest more infectious cause, and pt was emperically
treated with levo and zosyn. PNA was confirmed by GNR on sputum
culture - citrobacter and E coli, both sensitive to
ciprofloxacin, so zosyn was stopped and levofloxacin was
continued for a total of 15 days.
.
Initially, plans were being made for placement of a
tracheostomy, however once patient developed recurrent sepsis,
care was withdrawn as noted above.
.
#) Acute renal failure in setting of cadaveric transplant:
Initial epsiode of ARF likely combination of pre-renal effects
of hypotension and nephrotoxicity of elevated prograft levels.
ARF likely pre-renal in nature given hypotension and shock. U/S
done previously this stay within normal limits.  Urine eos
negative, and urine electrolytes unrevealing.  On [**9-21**] prograft
level found to be greatly elevated, and prograft was held for 4
days, then restarted.  Pt had medabolic acidosis, which was
treated with IV bicarb to attempt to decrease respiratory ra
