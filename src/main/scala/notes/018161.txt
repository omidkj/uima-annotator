Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7934**]
Chief Complaint:
Hypoxic respiratory failure

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation, esophageal baloon

History of Present Illness:
HPI: Pt is a 58 y/o f with htn, dm2, hypercholesterolemia who
presented to an OSH with increasing sob and cxr/chest CT
infiltrates felt to respresent an ILD, was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]
floor for further work-up, underwent VATS 1 day prior to MICU
admission, and developed hypoxemia and respiratory distress on
the night of admission, prompting micu transfer and intubation.
Apparently she first began developing sx one month prior to
presenting to the OSH with increasing sob, attributed at first
to a pneumonia that did not respond to antibiotics. Her sx
worsened and her doctor got a chest CT with diffuse bilateral
interstitial and ground glass opacities. At OSH, was ruled-out
for MI, negative stress test, echo with decreased e/a ratio, cta
without pe. She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] and underwent VATS one
night prior to MICU transfer, with the chest tube removed the
day of transfer. Overnight, she was seen by the nightfloat for
hypoxia and tachypnea, transferred to the MICU, and intubated.

Pertinent Results:
DATA:
.
Non Contrast CT chest [**9-6**]
IMPRESSION: Diffuse lung disease with a basal predominance. The
differential diagnosis include NSIP, UIP, or COP. The less
likely differentials are chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis,
sarcoidosis and drug related lung disease. If the patient is
immunocompromised, atypical infection such as PCP could be [**Name Initial (PRE) **]
possibility.
2) Mediastinal lymphadenopathy.
3) Innumerable small sub cm axillary lymph nodes and a 10 mm
right
prepectoral enlarged node.Clinical correlation recommended.
.
Bronch [**9-10**]:  showed no DAH and had no complications.
.
VATS DATA ([**9-7**]):
Right middle lobe, wedge biopsy:
a. Acute and organizing interstitial pneumonitis with features
of bronchiolitis obliterans/organizing pneumonitis (BOOP).
b. Intraparenchymal lymph node.
Right lower lobe biopsy:
a. Acute and organizing interstitial pneumonitis with features
of bronchiolitis obliterans/organizing pneumonitis (BOOP).
b. Subpleural fibrosis and pleural adhesions.
Note: Stains for bacteria and fungi are negative.
.
Other Lab Data:  +[**Doctor First Name **] (1:80), -ANCA, Neg Anti GBM.
.
CT Scan of Chest [**10-4**]
There are multiple subcentimeter right and left paratracheal,
prevascular, precarinal, and subcarinal lymph nodes measuring up
to 7 mm in diameter that do not individually meet criteria for
pathologic enlargement. There are no pathologically enlarged
axillary lymph nodes. There is a tiny left pleural effusion,
decreased in size from the previous examination. In comparison
with the examination of [**2108-9-17**], there is mild increase
in consolidative opacity within the airspaces at the lung bases
bilaterally and within the superior segment of the left lower
lobe. There is additional increase in air space consolidation at
the lung apices bilaterally, with patchy foci of dense
consolidation at the right lung apex and in left perihilar and
apical location. The distribution and extent of patchy
geographic ground-glass opacity throughout the remainder of the
lungs is probably not significantly changed in the interval.
Sutures are again seen at the right lung base. There is no
pneumothorax. Limited images of the liver, spleen, adrenal
glands, upper poles of the kidneys, appear unremarkable. There
is a small amount of dependent density within the gallbladder
suggestive of small stones or milk of calcium. BONE WINDOWS:
Bone windows demonstrate multiple right-sided rib deformities
consistent with old healed fractures. No suspicious lytic or
sclerotic osseous lesions are identified. IMPRESSION: 1.
Interval progression of bilateral airspace consolidation, most
prominent at the lung bases and within the superior segment of
the left lower lobe, and additionally involving the lung apices
and central perihilar regions. The geographic patchy ground
glass opacity appears approximately unchanged in distribution.
2. Decrease in size of small left pleural effusion. 3. Probable
gallstones or milk of calcium.


Brief Hospital Course:
AA/P: 58 y/o f with htn, DM2 and newly diagnosed ILD 1 day s/p
[**Hospital **] transferred to MICU and intubated for hypoxic respiratory
failure.  Extubated and improved for 5 days, then required
reintubation and remains intubated with increasing O2
requirements with a diagnosis of PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 11091**] (by BAL) superimposed
on her BOOP diagnosis.
.
1) Hypoxic respiratory failure -- Chest x-ray, discussed with
radiology, had appearance of progressive disease.  Final results
of VATS consistent with organizing interstitial pneumonitis with
features of BOOP.  She progressed on antibiotics in the past,
had no fever/wbc, all making an overlying infectious process
seem unlikely at the time.  Pt had fairly normal echo at the
OSH, making failure also seem to be an unlikely candidate.  Pt
was on high dose solumedrol during this time.  Pts repiratory
function improved, and she was extubted on [**9-12**].  She remained
on high flow mask until [**9-18**] but was very anxious with
occasional desats and CT chest on [**9-17**] showed worsening
bilateral infiltrates.  BAL was done [**9-18**] and she was paralyzed
with cisatracurium at 0.16mg/kg/hr and an esopageal baloon was
placed and she was reintubated on APRV and then PC ventillation.
 BAL micro data grew PCP pneumonia and IV Bactrim was started.
The question remains whether this was in the setting of high
dose steroids (only short course prior to diagnosis) or due to
an underlying immunocompromised condition.  ID was consulted
after several days of continued inability to wean with high
loading pressures (>30).  Several fungal studies were negative
as were autoimmune serologies except for [**Doctor First Name **] which was positive
(RF negative).   Steroids were dosed at 60mg IV BID starting
[**9-20**].  On [**9-25**], she was reintubated over a guidewire for cuff
leak.  For the next several days, all attempts to wean
ventillation were unsuccessful. The patient remained fluid
overloaded and daily I/O goals were net negative.  She received
fluids with antibiotics, etc. that made this difficult to attain
and lasix drip was used intermittently.  In addition, the
patient has an underlying anxiety disorder and required
increasing amounts of sedation of both Fentanyl and Versed.  As
soon as sedation began to wean, BP was >185 systolic with
apparant distress.  Several times, during daily sedation weans,
we asked the pt to report on any pain.  She responded with head
nods or shakes appropriately to questions and denied any pain or
other known sources of what could have been contributing to her
elevated BP.  She did admit to being anxious.  Starting around
[**9-30**], discussions about trach began with the family.  Per IP,
given her high PEEP requirement on AC (>10), a surgical should
be considered as well. Between [**Date range (1) 11301**],
