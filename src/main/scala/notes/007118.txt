History of Present Illness:
This is a 47 yo woman with h/o GTC seizure d/o since
childhood, seizure free x 5 years, who ran out of her meds and
had not been taking her meds for 2 - 3 days. She went to a PCP
appointment, and while in the waiting room she had a generalized

tonic clonic seizure x 30 seconds. She was transferred to
Leminster ED, and en route to CT scan she had another
generalized
tonic clonic seizure [**Name8 (MD) **] RN notes x 1 min with "eyes up and to
the left", and "drooling." She continued to have several
seizures, given valium 5mg IV x 4 doses (first dose 11am),
depakote 500mg IV x 1 (level 14 at OSH), then intubated with
versed 2mg, fentanyl 150mcg x 2, given another 10mg valium (last

dose 1455), and succinylcholine for paralysis. She was given
more paralytics en route to [**Hospital1 18**] per ER staff (although cannot
find this information in the notes), thus my exam in the ED is
not informative (unresponsive, no brain stem signs, no response
to pain). Labs at OSH of significance: utox + cocaine and
benzos. ? QT prolongation on EKG.

Per mother, patient has been feeling very well lately, no c/o
fever, pain, cough, dysuria. ED notes indicate she did c/o chest

pain upon arrival to ED at OSH. She was intubated one other
time for status epilepticus in her teens. Call was placed to her

primary neurologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 64361**] of [**Hospital1 **], but my call was not
returned.

CXR - No pneumothorax. Left basilar atelectasis versus
aspiration.

CT head - No acute intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect.

EEG - This is a normal discontinous 24-hour bedside telemetry
from [**7-31**]. There are no lateralizing or
epileptiform
discharges seen, though some of the portions of the tracing were

obscured by movement artifact, and no comment can be made as to
the
presence or absence of abnormalities during those periods.


Brief Hospital Course:
Patient is a 47 y.o. female with a history of GTC seizure
disorder who presents after transfer from outside hospital for
management of generalized tonic-clonic seizure.  The patient was
initially admitted to the Neuro ICU where she was quickly
extubated without difficulty.  She was transferred to the
neurology floor for further evaluation.  Upon initial transfer
to the floor there was a question of whether the patient was in
non-convulsive status based on episodes where she would close
her eyes and be less resposive.  However, bedside EED was
negative.  During hospital stay, patient has been managed on
diazepam, divalproex sodium, gabapentin, and lorazepam.  She has
been seen by social work for substance abuse and access to
resourced.  Arrangements for transportation to her mother's home
upon discharge.
