Pertinent Results:
ECHO [**2145-7-15**]
Conclusions:
The left atrium is normal in size. The left ventricular cavity
size is normal.
Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall left
ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular
chamber size and
free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
appear structurally
normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Mild
to moderate ([**12-8**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Moderate [2+]
tricuspid
regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension.

CXR [**2145-7-13**]
Status post-left lower lobectomy. Chest tube is present in the
left lower hemithorax. Since the previous study of [**2145-7-12**], there has been a significant reduction in the subcutaneous
emphysema in the left chest wall. Persistent subcutaneous
emphysema is present in both chest walls and in the neck

Brief Hospital Course:
Pt was admiited to [**Hospital1 18**] w/ Left empyema necessitans. An
ultrasound guided tap was done of the left chest fluid
collection for micro. Pt was started on broad spectrum IVAB
while waiting culture data. Infectious disease was consulted and
pt was placed on resp isolation and r'd/o for TB.

 Pre-op w/u revealed elevated INR of 5.3 w/o history of
anticoagulation. Hepatology was consulted and pt was found to
have VIT K deficiency. She was also transfused with PRBC for
anemia. She was given VIT K and FFP to correct her INR prior to
going to the OR on HD# 3 for Bronchoscopy,Left thoracotomy with
drainage of left pleural empyema, left lower lobectomy,
decortication and repair of left diaphragm. 3 chest tubes were
placed intraoperatively for continued draiange and lung
expansion.

Post -op pt remained intubated and admitted to the ICU for
pulmonary and hemodyanmic monitoring on neo. Extubated on POD#1.
Required serial bronchoscopies post operatively for left lung
collapse d/t secretions and inability to participate in pul
tiolet. POD#2 pt was transferred out of the intensive care unit.
She continued to required serial bronchoscopies for pul tiolet.
chest tubes placed to water seal and pt developed extensive SQ
air in the chest, neck and face. chest tubes were placed back to
sxn w/ slow resolution of SQ air over the ensuing days. One
chest tube and one [**Doctor Last Name **] were removed on POD#9 and 11. The
remaining chest tube was converted to an empyema tube w/ stable
chest XRAY.
Infectious disease followed pt closely thru out her hospital
course. Her culture data:
BAL [**6-30**] [**Female First Name (un) **]- contaminant
LLL [**6-30**] s. milleri
At this point her antibiotics were tapered and she was placed on
PCN G ( she had a questionable allergy to PCN and therefore was
moved to the ICU for her initial dosing. [**Last Name (un) **] dosing well and
was d/c'd from the ICU.
A left brachial Picc line was placed on [**2145-7-8**] with the tip in
the SVC after repostioning.
Pt progressed slowly but well and was d/c'd to home with PCN G
thru [**2145-8-11**] w/ close ID follow up and VNA/PT services.
