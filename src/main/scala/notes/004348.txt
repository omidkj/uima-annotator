[**2175-1-23**] 12:11 pm SPUTUM  GRAM STAIN (Final [**2175-1-23**]):
      3+  (5-10 per 1000X FIELD):   MULTIPLE ORGANISMS
CONSISTENT WITH
                                    OROPHARYNGEAL FLORA.
   RESPIRATORY CULTURE (Final [**2175-1-25**]):
      MODERATE GROWTH Commensal Respiratory Flora.

Chest X-Ray:
[**2175-1-25**] The right internal jugular line has been removed. The
right upper lobe opacity has improved in the interim and might
be consistent with resolution of post-surgical hematoma.
[**2175-1-22**] Chest tube remains and there is no evidence of
pneumothorax or substantial effusion, though pleural thickening
persists on the right. Mild vascular congestion is again seen
and there are some streaks of atelectasis at the left base.
[**2175-1-21**] Atelectasis has cleared from the right middle lobe, but
consolidation persists
in the upper lobe could be asymmetric re-expansion edema,
contusion or less likely this early in the postoperative period,
aspiration pneumonia.
Borderline cardiomegaly and mild pulmonary vascular congestion
persists and there is subsegmental atelectasis in the left lung,
unchanged. Right
pneumothorax is minimal, at the apex, if any, and right pleural
collection is also very small, if any, one basal and one apical
pleural tube is still in place. With the chin down, the tip of
the endotracheal tube 2.45 cm above the carina is acceptable.
Right jugular line ends at the junction of
brachiocephalic veins. Mediastinal drains noted.
