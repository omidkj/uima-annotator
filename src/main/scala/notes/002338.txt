CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Shortness of breath and fever.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a [**Age over 90 **] year-old
woman with history of moderate AF, paroxysmal atrial
fibrillation, hypothyroidism, dementia and essential
thrombocythemia who presents with shortness of breath and
fever.  The patient is a resident of [**Hospital3 **] who was in her usual state of health until
approximately one week prior to admission when she noticed
cough and cold like symptoms.  These symptoms worsened over
the following week.  The cough productive of dark green
sputum.  She was seen by a physician at the [**Hospital3 537**]
three days prior to admission.  At that time she was treated
with nebulizers for presumed viral urinary tract infection.
However, her condition continued to deteriorate.
Specifically, she became more short of breath, reduced
exercise intolerance, worsening cough with productive sputum,
and decreased exercise tolerance.  She was brought to the
[**Hospital1 69**] for further evaluation.
In the emergency department she was noted to be febrile to
102.3.  Chest x-ray showed possible right upper lobe
pneumonia.  The patient was treated with ceftriaxone and
azithromycin.  She was also noted to be in rapid atrial
fibrillation and was started on a diltiazem drip.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1) Vertigo.  2) Moderate aortic
stenosis.  3) Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.  4) History of
urinary tract infections.  5) Hypothyroidism.  6) Alzheimer's
with multi-infarct dementia.  7) Echocardiogram in [**6-/2162**] at
outside hospital showing normal left ventricular ejection
fraction, mild diastolic dysfunction, calcified aorta, mild
pulmonary hypertension, moderate aortic stenosis.

ALLERGIES:  Question allergy to penicillin.

MEDICATIONS:  [**Doctor First Name **] 30 mg b.i.d., Flonase q.d.,
multivitamin, Aricept 5 mg q day, hydroxyurea 500 mg q day,
hydrocortisone cream, metoprolol 12.5 mg b.i.d., Levoxyl 112
mcg q.d., Coumadin 2.5 mg q.d., Nizoral, Dilantin, Xalatan.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient has a very supportive family.
She currently lives in [**Hospital3 **] and is
capable of completing her anterior cruciate ligament without
assistance.  She walks with a walker.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Noncontributory.

ADMISSION LABORATORIES:  Were notable for an INR of 4.6.  Her
chem-7 was unremarkable.  Her urinalysis was negative for
nitrates and leukocytes.  Cardiac enzymes were negative.

Chest x-ray:  Right upper lobe opacity consistent with
possible pneumonia.  No congestive heart failure noted.
Bibasilar atelectasis.

EKG:  Atrial fibrillation with ventricular rate greater than
100.  No ST segment changes.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the medicine
service for further evaluation.  She was alert and oriented
at time of admission.  She was complaining of subjective
shortness of breath and was breathing at a respiratory rate
of approximately 20.  She was saturating 85 to 95 percent on
2 liters by nasal cannula.  She reported only minimal
improvement to nebulizer treatment.  She was febrile in the
emergency department but remained afebrile on the floor.  She
was started on Levofloxacin for treatment of her pneumonia.
On day of admission the resident and intern were called to
see the patient at approximately 2 P.M. for tachycardia and
shortness of breath.  The patient had been titrated off her
diltiazem drip which had been started in the emergency
department.  She was maintained on metoprolol.  At the time
the intern and resident examined the patient she was satting
95 percent on 2 liters by nasal cannula.  A repeat chest
x-ray was unchanged from prior with no signs of congestive
heart failure.  It was felt that the patient was stable at
this time.  Her elevated heart rate was transient and was
treated by increasing her metoprolol dose.  She was noted to
be again in atrial fibrillation.  Then again at 7 P.M. the
intern was called to see the patient for increased confusion.
At that time the patient was noted to have labored breathing.
A pulse oximeter measured her O2 saturation to be
approximately 65.  She was started on a nonrebreather.  An
arterial blood gases was obtained which showed a pCO2 of 109,
a pO2 of 102, and a pH of 7.06.  Calculated sodium bicarb was
33 percent.  The patient had a repeat chest x-ray obtained.
This showed some mild congestive heart failure.  The Medical
Intensive Care Unit team was notified and the patient was
transferred to the Intensive Care Unit.  The family was also
notified.  The patient's daughter stated that she wanted her
mother to be DNR/DNI.  Again the patient was supertherapeutic
on Coumadin with an INR of 4.6.  She was reversed with
vitamin K.  Patient's hydroxyurea therapy was discontinued
while in the Medical Intensive Care Unit.  She was started on
cefepime, Vancomycin and levofloxacin for treatment of her
pneumonia.  The patient was reversed with vitamin K and a
PICC line was placed.  She continued to improve over the
following days.  Her heart rate was controlled with
intravenous metoprolol and/or Lopressor.  All cultures both
blood and urine remained negative during her hospital course.
The patient was transferred to the floor for further
management on [**2163-4-4**].  The patient was transitioned to
p.o. medications.  Speech and swallow evaluation was
conducted which revealed that the patient tolerated thick and
liquids well.  She was continued on antibiotics for a ten day
course.  After discontinuing of her antibiotics the patient
had increasing white blood cell count.  She was also noted to
have very mild low grade fevers and very minor change in
mental status.  Patient was then restarted on antibiotics and
the CT scan was obtained of her chest.  The CT scan was
relatively unremarkable but did show possible early
pneumonia. The patient was continued on a seven day course of
cefepime, Vancomycin.  Upon completing this course the
patient remained afebrile and remained alert and oriented.
Prior to discharge her mental status continued to improve.
Her course was also complicated by renal insufficiency with
increase in her creatinine to 2.3 from a baseline of 0.7.
This was felt to be due to a transient episode of
hypotension.  Her creatinine began to improve again prior to
discharge and was 1.8 at time of discharge.

OVERALL IMPRESSION:  This is a [**Age over 90 **] year-old female with a past
medical history significant for central thrombocytosis,
moderate atrial fibrillation and congestive heart failure.
who presented with worsening shortness of breath and
tachycardia.  It was believed that the patient's pneumonia
worsened her atrial fibrillation causing her to have an
increase in heart rate.  This in turn caused the patient to
go into decompensated congestive heart failure requiring a
Medical Intensive Care Unit stay with aggressive diuresis.
The patient was treated for pneumonia with antibiotics.  Her
course was complicated by an episode of renal insufficiency
which was resolving by time of discharge.  The patient was
tolerating good p.o. intake and was cleared by speech and
swallow on the day of discharge.
