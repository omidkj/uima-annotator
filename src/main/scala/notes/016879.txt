Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2485**]
Chief Complaint:
Chief Complaint: Low oxygen saturation at clinic
Reason for MICU admission: hypercarbic respiratory failure


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation/mechanical ventilation
Arterial line placement
s/p tracheostomy placement [**2162-3-8**]

History of Present Illness:
38M with NHL s/p alloSCT [**2155**] and DLI [**2156**], in remission but
with chronic GVHD including bronchiolitis obliterans and severe
restrictive lung disease, initially admitted to [**Year (4 digits) 3242**] service on
[**2-4**] with shortness of breath, now transferred to MICU for
hypercarbic respiratory failure.
.
He was at routine clinic visit on [**2-4**] and noted shortness of
breath and sats 93% RA. He had had recent outpatient treatment
for pneumonia starting [**1-21**], briefly interrupted due to elevated
bilirubin. Has been on very low dose IL-2 subcutaneously at
home, last received prior to admission.
.
During his hospital course, he was treated with cefepime and
levofloxacin (now day 14). Pulmonary was consulted and
recommended chest PT and hypertonic saline. He remained on RA
for the most part, maintaining sats in 90-97% range. Afebrile
with exception of T100.5 on [**2-9**] and 100.3 this morning. IL-2
was stopped at admission and tacrolimus was trialed for enhanced
immunosuppresion, but was stopped today due to development of
tremor in the past few days.
On rounds this AM he noted fatigue without new respiratory
symptoms. Got chest PT, lasix 20 mg, vancomycin, and nebs.
During the course of the morning he looked more fatigued then
started working harder to breathe. CXR was grossly unchanged. He
was started on 1-2L O2. Somnolence then developed and he needed
to be lifted from chair to bed. ABG done and pending at the time
of transfer. He was working hard to breathe but not responding
to verbal stimuli. He was rapidly transported to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] and
intubated. Immediately prior to intubation he was apneic and
required bag ventilation.
.
Review of Systems:
(+) Unable to obtain; see admission note. Notables include
significant weight loss for which GI was consulted, and
development of bilateral LE edema (as well as some in UEs).


Past Medical History:
Past Oncologic History:
- [**4-/2154**] p/w fevers, night sweats, and weight loss in the
setting of a left inguinal lymph node.
- CT scan: 15x14x10cm mass in the LUQ.
- Bx grade II/III follicular lymphoma.
- Treated with six cycles of CHOP/Rituxan with good response,
but showed evidence for relapse in [**12/2154**] and was treated with
MINE chemotherapy for two cycles.
- [**3-/2155**]: Underwent stem cell mobilization with Cytoxan followed
by autologous stem cell transplant in
- [**7-/2155**]: Noted for disease recurrence. He was initially treated
with a course of Rituxan without response followed by Zevalin
with
- [**3-/2156**]: Noted progression of his disease. He was treated with

one cycle of [**Hospital1 **] followed by one cycle of ESHAP.
- [**2156-7-29**]: Nonmyeloablative allogeneic stem cell transplant
with a [**5-30**] HLA-matched unrelated donor with Campath conditioning

- Six-month follow-up CT noted for disease progression.
- [**1-/2157**]: Received donor lymphocyte infusion in , complicated by
acute liver/GI GVHD grade IV, for which [**Known firstname **] required a
prolonged hospitalization in the summer of [**2156**].
- Multiple GI bleeds requiring ICU admissions and multiple
transfusions and embolization of his bleeding.
- Noted to have CNS lesions felt consistent with PTLD and this
was treated with a course of Rituxan. No evidence for recurrence
of the PTLD.
- Acute liver GVHD, on CellCept, prednisone, and photophoresis.

- [**2157-12-28**] Photophoresis was d/c'd due to episodes of
bacteremia and eventual removal of his apheresis catheter.
- [**2158-6-13**] restarted photopheresis on a weekly basis on , but
then discontinued this again on [**2158-9-7**] as this was felt not
to be making any impact on his liver function tests.
- undergone phlebotomy due to iron overload with corresponding
drop in his ferritin. He has continued with transient rises in
his transaminases and bilirubin and has remained on varying
doses of CellCept and prednisone which has been slowly tapered
over the time.
- [**2160-1-10**] CellCept discontinued.
- [**2159-1-19**] admission due to increasing right hip pain. MRI
revealed edema and infiltrating process in the psoas muscle
bilaterally. After extensive workup, this was felt related to an
infection and required several admissions with completion of
antibiotics in 03/[**2158**].
- [**7-/2160**]: Last scans showed no evidence for lymphom and he has
remained in remission.
- [**2160-10-20**]: URI and treatment with course of Levaquin.
- [**2160-11-13**] completed a 4 week course of Rituxan to treat his
GVHD.
-In [**5-/2161**], noted to have tiny echogenic nodule on abdominal
[**Year (4 digits) 950**]. MRI of the liver also showed this nodule but was not
as concerning on review and he is due to have a repeat MRI
imaging in early [**Month (only) **].
-- GI varices and attempts at banding have been unsuccessful due
to difficulty with passing the necessary instruments. He has
been on a low dose beta blocker as well as simvastatin, which
was started on [**2161-7-7**] to help with medical management of his
varices.
-On [**2161-8-3**], worsening cough and was noted to have a small
new pneumothorax in the left apical area. This has essentially
resolved over time
- Issues with weight loss (followed by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]);
multiple tests done with no etiology found; question
malabsorption related to GVHD
- Has on and off respiratory infections and has been treated
with antibiotics with possible pneumonia. Question underlying
exacerbations of pulmonary GVHD in setting of his URIs.
- Currently receives IVIG every month.
