Imaging:
CXR ([**2180-6-23**]): No evidence of pneumonia
MRI OF THE SOFT TISSUES OF THE NECK ([**2183-6-26**]): Enhancing
irregular masses are identified in the posterior neck,
especially on the right, at the level of C2 and extending
inferiorly
CT Torso w/contrast ([**2180-7-18**]): Stable appearance of multiple
sub-cm mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy as well as stable
appearance of mediastinal soft tissue. Stable appearance of
numerous tiny bilateral pulmonary nodules. No new pulmonary
nodules identified. Stable appearance of hepatic hemangioma. 20
x 13 mm subcutaneous lesion of the anterior left shoulder with
internal hounsfield density consistent with air. It is unclear
what this lesion represents and clinical correlation is
suggested.


Brief Hospital Course:
1. Fever/Sepsis/Neutropenia: Pt admitted to medicine, initially
treated with treated with broad spectrum antibiotics, IVF, blood
cultures were performed daily. He was initially started on
Cefepime and Vancomycin due to a history of MRSA abscess, as
well as Flagyl for gram negative coverage). Pt was found to be
borderline neutropenic with ANC of 1200. Pt was also transfused
1 unit pRBC for anemia (HCt24.2, increased to 27.5).  Two days
after admission he remained febrile as high as 104F, became
tachycardic and hypotensive with good response to fluid boluses.
 Rash was also noted across face, chest, arms - non pruritic,
non painful thought to be secondary to drug rash vs. reaction to
blood transfusion.  At that time, abx regimen was changed to
Vancomycin, Aztreonam, and Levofloxacin (Cefepime was
discontinued to do ? drug reaction). Voriconazole was started
for fungal coverage as well as one dose of Gentamicin.  Pt was
pan cultured and sent to the OR for double lumen porta cath
removal (empiric for ?line sepsis) and admitted to the ICU for
sepsis management, hypoxemia and hypotension.
.
On admission to [**Name (NI) 153**], pt had [**Name (NI) **], cough, fatigue/weakness, some
diarrhea and unknown source of infection.  He was continued with
aggressive fluid resuscitation (central line - RIJ -placed
[**6-27**]), Vancomycin, Flagyl, Aztreonam, voriconazole were
continued, Levofloxacin was d/ced due to ?drug rash and history
of cipro allergy. Gentamicin was added for double gram neg
coverage.  Pt's blood pressure stabilized with fluid
resuscitation and fever defervesced with Abx and
Tylenol/Ibuprofen. CXR revealed congestion and pt obtained
diuresis with relief of [**Month/Year (2) **], thought to be due to flash
pulmonary edema secondary to chemo induced cardiomyopathy. By
[**6-30**] patient was improving, improved leukocytosis, but pt
remained febrile. Voriconazole and Flagyl discontinued at that
time as fevers were thought to be secondary to drug reaction vs.
underlying lymphoma. Repeat CD4 count was 184 (previously 800),
viral load >10,000. Pt was transferred back to medicine floor on
[**2180-7-1**].
.
Pt came to the floor feeling much better but still having fevers
of unknown etiology. Sources included the healing abscess in the
neck, chest wound after catheter removal, drug reaction? Pt was
empirically covered with Vancomycin and Aztreonam. All cultures
still negative but patient became febrile to 102. Gentamycin
added back, Atovaquone added for PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 1102**]. MRI of the
neck did not show persistence/recurrence of abscess or
osteomyelitis. HBV, HCV sent due to rising LFTs all negative. C.
Diff, galactomannin and strongyloides sent and were negative due
to persistent diarrhea. Pt was re-evaluated by the ICU due to
persistent fevers, diarrhea and tachycardia. Pt was deemed fit
to be managed on the floor. During his stay on the floor he
received his third dose of chemo during which time antibiotics
were held. He was later restarted on Vanco/Aztreonam. Pt
stabilized but remained with intermittent fevers and
tachycardia. Neutropenia resolved with stable WBC. CT torso of
the abdomen was performed as a last effort to identify a source,
which was unrevealing. Wound cultures taken from the site of
line removal grew resistant coagulase positive staph aureus for
which he was empirically covered by Vancomycin.

2. [**Name Initial (PRE) **] - Pt complaining of subjective [**Name Initial (PRE) **] on presentation to
ICU.  O2 sats good on 3L
