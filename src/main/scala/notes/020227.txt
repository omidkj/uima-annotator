Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1406**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath and chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2197-5-12**]
1. Epiaortic ultrasound
2. Mitral valve replacement with a 29-mm St. [**Male First Name (un) 923**] Epic tissue
valve model #E100-29M-00, Serial #[**Serial Number 104821**].

History of Present Illness:
80 year old female with severe dilated cardiomyopathy, heart
failure, and severe mitral regurgitation. She reports worsening
shortness of breath with talking and associated with chest
tightness and pressure on exertion. She reports occasional
associated palpitations, nausea, and dizziness. Most recent
echocardiogram shows moderately dilated right atrium, moderately
dilated left ventricular cavity with severely depressed LV
systolic function (LVEF 10-15%), 3+ mitral regurgitation, 2+
tricuspid regurgitation, and severe pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension with significant pulmonic regurgitation. She was
referred for right and left heart catheterization and pre-op
evaluation for cardiac surgery for a mitral valve replacement
and tricuspid valve repair. Cath results below. Admitted today
for heparin bridge with plans for MVR/TV repair in AM with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **].

Pertinent Results:
ECHO [**2197-5-12**]: Pre Bypass: The left atrium is markedly dilated.
The left atrium is elongated. No mass/thrombus is seen in the
left atrium or left atrial appendage. The right atrium is
markedly dilated. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color
Doppler. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity is severely dilated. There is severe global
left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = [**5-25**] %). The right
ventricular free wall thickness is normal. The right ventricular
cavity is markedly dilated with mild global free wall
hypokinesis. [Intrinsic right ventricular systolic function is
likely more depressed given the severity of tricuspid
regurgitation.] There are simple atheroma in the aortic root.
There are simple atheroma in the ascending aorta. There are
simple atheroma in the aortic arch. There are complex (>4mm)
atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is no aortic valve
stenosis. There is mild aortic valve stenosis (valve area
1.2-1.9cm2). Plainemetry yields 1.8, calcuations yield 1.4 in
the setting of a cardiac index of 1.2-1.4.. Trace aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are moderately
thickened. There is moderate thickening of the mitral valve
chordae. Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are moderately thickened. Moderate
to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. Initial TR was
moderate at worst, but was dynamic and became 3+ when pulmonary
artery pressures increased to 60's systolic. There is IVC flow
reversal. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
Post bypass: Patient is a-paced in Epinepherine, Milrinone, and
Phenylepherine infusions. There is a tissue prosthetic mitral
valve in place without MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 31820**] leaks. Peak gradient
[**11-28**], mean 5 mm Hg. Note is made of a presistent artifact in
the left atrium which precludes full visualization of other
structures. This could represent artifact from the valve,
suture, a probe problem, or other- discussed with surgeons and
images reviewed with surgeons prior to chest closure. TR is now
trace to mild. Peak gradient 1. LV function is slightly improved
on ionotropes to 10-15%. RV function is now moderately
hypokinetic. Aortic contours intact. Remaining exam is
unchanged. All findings discussed with surgeons at the time of
the exam.
.
Echo [**2197-5-15**]: Marked left ventricular cavity dilation with
severe global hypokinesis c/w diffuse process. Right ventricular
free wall hypokinesis. Moderate pulmonary artery hypertension.
Well seated mitral valve bioprosthesis with normal gradient.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2197-4-26**], the
mitral valve has been replaced with a normal functioning mitral
valve bioprosthesis and right ventricular free wall motion is
improved. The other findings are similar.
.
CXR [**2197-5-22**]: As compared to the previous radiograph, there is a
substantial
decrease of the right pleural effusion after thoracocentesis.
The remaining effusion is limited to the costophrenic sinus.
There is mild opacity at the right lung base, potentially
representing re-expansion edema. The right lung shows no
pneumothorax. Unchanged moderate cardiomegaly with retrocardiac
atelectasis.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 104824**] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2197-5-11**] for surgical
management of her mitral and tricuspid valve disease. She was
placed on heparin as a bridge to surgery and worked-up in the
usual preoperative manner. On [**2197-5-12**], she was taken to the
operating room where she underwent a mitral valve replacement
and tricuspid valve repair. Please see operative note for
details. Postoperatively she was taken to the intensive care
unit for monitoring on epinephrine and milrinone. Initial
post-op chest tube output was high and she received multiple
blood products as well as prot
