Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 922**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2158-3-27**] 1. Coronary bypass grafting x3: Reverse saphenous vein
 graft from aorta to posterior descending coronary artery;
reverse saphenous vein single graft from aorta to second obtuse
marginal coronary artery; as well as reverse saphenous vein
single graft from aorta to the first diagonal coronary artery.
2. Endoscopic left greater saphenous vein harvesting.


History of Present Illness:
87 year old male with known history of coronary artery disease
s/p catheterization [**9-4**] which has been medically managed,
stable angina x 20 years, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and
COPD,who reports non-radiating substernal chest tightening x 10
minutes during exertion which was relieved with 1 SL NTG.Shortly
thereafter he resumed walking and experienced a second episode
of chest tightening and took a 2nd SL NTG. Emt was called and he
was taken to [**Hospital1 18**] for further cardiac workup. Positive troponin
along with ECG changes revealed NSTEMI. Cardiac surgery was
consulted for possible revascularization.

Past Medical History:
HTN
Hypercholesterolemia
COPD
SEVERE PTSD- WWII Veteran
Right Facial Nerve Palsy: VERY sensitive about this. He has
trouble eating and often drools. His wife asks that we not
discuss this AT ALL with him, as he becomes very upset and often
cries.

Sinus rhythm with premature beats that may be junctional. Modest
right
ventricular conduction delay pattern may be incomplete right
bundle-branch
block although is non-diagnostic. Low QRS voltage. Diffuse ST-T
wave
abnormalities are non-specific but cannot exclude myocardial
ischemia. Clinical
correlation is suggested. Since the previous tracing of [**2158-3-10**]
ST-T wave
changes are less prominent.

Findings
RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: A catheter or pacing wire is
seen in the RA and extending into the RV. No ASD by 2D or color
Doppler.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Mild symmetric LVH. Normal regional LV systolic
function. Overall normal LVEF (>55%).

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTA: Normal aortic diameter at the sinus level. Simple
atheroma in ascending aorta. Simple atheroma in descending
aorta.

AORTIC VALVE: Normal aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS. Mild (1+)
AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. Mild to
moderate ([**1-28**]+) MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Mild [1+] TR.

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify I was present in compliance with HCFA
regulations. The patient was under general anesthesia throughout
the procedure. No TEE related complications. The patient appears
to be in sinus rhythm. Results were personally reviewed with the
MD caring for the patient.
Conclusions
Prebypass

No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is
mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. Regional left
ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There are simple
atheroma in the ascending aorta. There are simple atheroma in
the descending thoracic aorta. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no
aortic stenosis. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild to moderate
([**1-28**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial
effusion. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 914**] was notified in person of the results on
[**2158-3-27**] at 900am.

Post bypass

Patient is in sinus rhythm and receiving an infusion of
phenylephrine. Biventricular systolic function is unchanged.
Mild mitral regurgitation persists. Aorta is intact post
decannulation.
  I certify that I was present for this procedure in compliance
with HCFA regulations.
