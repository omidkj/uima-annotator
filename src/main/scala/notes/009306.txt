History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Name13 (STitle) 14893**] is a 62 year old male transferred from [**Hospital1 **] for
ICU level care after a dx of severe R sided PNA. He presented to
the OSH today from home after one day of increased work of
breathing, SOB, lethargy (per wife), change in MS [**First Name (Titles) 767**] [**Last Name (Titles) 5348**],
and decreased po intake. He has a history of PNA and has had
similar presentations in the past. At the OSH, a CXR showed a
near white out of the R lung. He was noted to be hypoxic (82% on
RA), tachypneic (23), and tachycardic (109). He was given IVF
for an episode of transient hypotension that resolved. He was
also started on levo/flagyl for presumed aspiration pneumonia,
and subsequently switched to broader coverage with
Vanc/Meropenem after cultures returned negative. He did not
require intubation and was never on pressors. He has remained
hemodynamically stable and his breathing treatments have
decreased in frequency. He subjectively feels better and was
transferred from the MICU in stable condition.

Pertinent Results:
Imaging:
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2107-1-19**] 11:39 PM
IMPRESSION:
Likely acute superimposed alveolar process involving right mid
and lower lungs and left lower lobe on background parenchymal
disease. Old films if available would be helpful for comparison.
.
CHEST PORT. LINE PLACEMENT  [**2107-1-20**] 10:56 AM
Since most recent film, there has been interval placement of a
right-sided PICC catheter with its tip in the mid SVC. There is
no evidence of pneumothorax. Underlying reticular nodular
disease within the lungs is stable as is alveolar consolidative
process within the right mid and lower lung fields and
retrocardiac region. Right apical scarring is stable in
appearance. Large amount of stool within the bowel is again
identified.

IMPRESSION:
Right-sided PICC with tip in mid SVC. No evidence of
pneumothorax. Otherwise, unchanged radiograph.
.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2107-1-21**] 3:34 AM
FINDINGS: Cardiac size is normal. The lungs are hyperinflated in
keeping with patient's known emphysema. There has been
improvement of the acute component of the pulmonary abnormality
consistent with pulmonary edema. Distortion of the architecture
in the right lung with increase in the interstitial markings are
likely chronic. Please correlate with prior therapy like
radiation. There is a small right pleural effusion and/or
pleural thickening. Right PICC line tip is in the SVC.

Brief Hospital Course:
62 yo M s/p MICU admission for sepsis and r-sided culture
negative presumed pneumonia.
.
.
#) Pulmonary Infiltrate: Patient admitted with elevated lactate,
leuckocytosis and hypotension suspected pneumonia/UTI
empirically started on Vancomycin/Meropenem while awaiting
cultures/sensitivities. Current thought is that pneumonia may be
either aspiration or CAP. Patient with underlying brochiectasis
predisposing patient to infection. Patient has not had a CT to
assess interstitial lung disease. Patient's imaging did improve
with diuretics suggesting some underlying CHF incited by
respiratory condition.  Given that the patient's cultures were
negative, tghe broad spectrum antibiotics were discontinued and
he was discharged on a 10-day dcourse of Levofloxacin.
.
#. ILD/COPD: Pt has history of ILD/COPD/Emphysema. On
Albuterol/Atrovent at home. Goal oxygen saturation is low 90's.
Patient was continued on his home regimen and maintained
appropriate oxygen saturation while on the floor.
.
#. CHRONIC GASTRITIS: S/p multiple partial gastrectomies for
recurrent ulcers. Continued on home regimen.
.
#. CHRONIC PAIN: Pt has long history of chronic pain related to
peripheral neuropathy. Opioid dependent.  Continued on fentanyl
patch, oxycodone, gabapentin & amitriptylline
.
#. MS: Not on any meds at [**Month/Day/Year 5348**]. Ambulatory with cane.
.
#. HCV: Stable. Followed by PCP.

After discussion with the patient and the medical staff, all
were in agreement that [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 14894**] was a suitable candidate
