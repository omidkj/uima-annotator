CT abdomen/pelvis [**2174-8-24**]:
1. No intra-abdominal hemorrhage.
2. Sequelae of portal hypertension including varices and
moderate perihepatic simple ascites.
3. Severe degenerative changes of the left hip.

Visceral arteriography [**2174-8-25**]:
1. Normal celiac artery angiogram with selective catheterization
of the gastroduodenal artery and left gastric artery.
2. Normal superior mesenteric artery angiogram.
3. No active arterial extravasation from the visceral aortic
branches.

TTE [**2174-8-26**]:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. Regional left
ventricular wall motion is normal. Left ventricular systolic
function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%). There is a mild resting left
ventricular outflow tract obstruction. Right ventricular chamber
size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. There is
moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2174-7-4**], the
LV cavity is slightly smaller, there is some turbulence in the
LVOT with a mild functional outflow tract gradient.

TTE [**2174-8-28**]:
The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. Left
ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%). No
masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. There is no mitral valve prolapse. No
mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve. Physiologic
mitral regurgitation is seen (within normal limits). Tricuspid
regurgitation is present but cannot be quantified. There is mild
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
effusion. No interval change in comparison to [**2174-8-26**].

Brief Hospital Course:
61-year-old African-American pleasant male with genotype 1
hepatitis C-induced cirrhosis who is on the liver transplant
list presenting with confusion/lethargy [**12-29**] to encephalopathy
and/or hyponatremia.
.
Pertaining to his hospital course [**2174-8-18**] to [**2174-8-24**]:
.
# Hep C cirrhosis with HE:  Pt is on the liver transplant list
with Meld of 28 on admission. Family had noted an increase in
confusion over past few days prior to admission in setting of
not having BMs despite taking his lactulose and miralax.
Patient was given frequent lactulose with miralax and started
stooling adequately. Mental status and asterixis was waxing and
[**Doctor Last Name 688**] throughout his hospital stay.   He was also continued on
rifaximin and nadolol. His infectious workup was negative. His
lasix was initially held given hyponatremia.
.
# Hyponatremia:  Pt with Na+ of 117 on admisssion.  He has
chronically low sodium, however his baseline was 125. His renal
ultrasound was normal. Renal was consulted and after he did not
respond to fluid restriction, he was started on one dose of
tolvaptan, however did not respond and this was discontinued.
After starting the tolvaptan his urinary output decreased and
there was concern for HRS. He was about to be challenged with a
volume challenge when he was no longer holding his pressures and
required transfer to the unit.
.
# DM - Pt was given 5U of glargine nightly (takes levamir at
home). He was also maintained on insulin sliding scale while in
the hospital.
.
On [**8-24**]- the patient became oliguric, and developed hypotension
despite fluid bolus and hypothermia and was felt that he could
have sepsis of unknown origin and he was transferred to the
SICU.

Pertaining to his hospital course [**2174-8-24**] to [**2174-8-29**]:
.
On [**2174-8-24**], the patient was transferred to the SICU on the
transplant surgery service for hypothermia (T 93) and
hypotension (SBP 80).  Blood and urine cultures were repeated,
which showed no growth.  Blood was also negative for fungemia.
He was transfused 2u PRBC for hct 24.7, after which hct 22.1.
Rectal exam revealed positive occult blood without gross blood.
Nasogastric lavage revealed coffee grounds fluid which did not
clear significantly after 1L lavage.  He was further transfused
and started on octreotide and pantoprazole gtts.  He was
intubated and EGD found no obvious source of bleeding.
Bronchoscopy found no obvious bleed.  He developed epistaxis,
for which ENT was consulted, and his nasopharynx was packed.
.
On [**2174-8-25**], he was taken to IR.  Arteriography of the celiac
and superior mesenteric arteries revealed no obvious UGI bleed.
Bilateral inferior maxillary arteries were embolized for his
continued epistaxis.  At the end of the procedure, his abdomen
was distended and he was increasingly difficult to ventilate.
He was brought emergently to the operating room for
decompressive laparotomy, which revealed no intraperitoneal
bleed or hematoma.  He was left with an open abdomen and
returned to the SICU.  He developed worsening hypotension,
requiring norepinephrine gtt, and his abdomen was re-explored,
revealing some blood, but insufficient to explain his
transfusion requirements.  Bl
