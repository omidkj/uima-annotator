Allergies:
Doxycycline / lisinopril

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2297**]
Chief Complaint:
Unresponsiveness


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 4886**] is a 78-year-old female with past medical history
significant for hypertension,type 2 DM, distant breast cancer,
TTP (lengthy hospitalization [**4-/2141**] which required
corticosteroids, plasmapheresis, and rituximab), relapsing
polychondritis and ANCA positive pulmonary vasculitis.

The patient was in her usual state of health this evening at
6:30
PM, speaking to her son on the phone. He said, to EMS (from whom
we got direct sign-out), that his mother sounded slightly tired,
but this is her baseline and otherwise was normal.  He then came
to see her after running errands about 1 hr later and found her
lying
in emesis and stool. She was unreponsive and he could not wake
her. EMS called and found to develop a generalized tonic-clonic
seizure. The seizure lasted about 3.5 mintues, then stopped
spontaneously. She was then given Ativan 2mg, then intubated
with succinylcholine 100mg and etomidate 20mg, followed by
Versed 2.5 mg given concern about airway protection.  She was
then brought to [**Hospital1 18**].  Of note, son reports that this
presentation is almost identical to her prior presentation last
year, which required pheresis, and believes this was TTP.

In the field EJ and IO access was obtained.  She was in sinus
rhythm, in the 80s, blood pressure was 200/80 mmHg, and
breathing spotaneously (before intubation and medications).
Finger stick was 175.

In the ED CT head/Neck showed no acute intracranial hemorrhage.
She does have subtle areas of hypodensities in left basal
ganglia, pons, and midbrain maybe artifactual or represent
ischemia.  CTA basilar artery appears patent.  Sedation was
continued with propofol.  EKG showed 1st degree avb.  She was
noted to be febrile to 102.  CXR without pna.  She was started
on vanc/ctx/amp/acyclovir, but no LP was done due to low plt.
UA showed no bacteria or leuks, but did have large blood, 300
glucose, 300 protein

Of note, pt noted to have trop of 1.03, with flat MB.
Cardiology was conuslted who felt no need for urgent cardiac
intervention in setting of unchanged EKG.

On transfer, VS were 106 146/80s, 99% on CMV fi02 100, peep 5,
RR 16, TV 500.
On arrival to the MICU, VS were 100.1  109  106/63  100% on
above vent settings

RADIOGRAPHIC REPORTS
[**2142-4-29**]
CTA Head
INDICATION: 77-year-old woman with altered mental status and
seizures.

COMPARISON: None.

TECHNIQUE: Contiguous axial CT images through the head were
obtained without
contrast in the axial plane. After intravenous administration of
contrast,
MDCT images of the head and neck were obtained in the arterial
phase and axial
plane. MIPs, volume-rendered images, and curved reformats were
generated and
reviewed.

FINDINGS:

CT HEAD: There is no acute intracranial hemorrhage, vascular
territorial
infarction, edema, or mass effect seen. However, hypodense
regions in left
basal ganglia (2:14), pons (2:10) and midbrain maybe artifactual
or represent
edema, difficult to characterize further. Smaller hypodensities
are seen in
bilateral periventricular white matter concerning for small
vessel ischemic
disease. There is no hydrocephalus or midline shift. Dense
atherosclerotic
calcifications are seen in bilateral intracranial vertebral
arteries and
cavernous carotid arteries. No fracture is seen.

CTA HEAD: Bilateral intracranial internal carotid arteries,
vertebral artery,
small basilar artery and their major branches are patent with no
evidence of
stenosis, occlusion, dissection, or aneurysm formation. Right
vertebral
artery is dominant.

CTA NECK: There is a bovine arch configuration with a common
origin of the
innominate and left common carotid artery from the aortic arch.
Bilateral
common carotid arteries, internal carotid artery and vertebral
arteries in the
neck appear patent with no evidence of stenosis, occlusion,
dissection or
pseudoaneurysm formation. The right vertebral artery is
dominant. The left
vertebral artery appears congenitally hypoplastic. Both
vertebral artery
origins are patent. Visualized soft tissue structures in the
neck appear
unremarkable.

IMPRESSION:
1. While there is no evidence of hemorrhage or acute vascular
territorial
infarction, there is subtle hypoattenuation in the basal
ganglia, thalami,
pons and midbrain, suspicious for edema.

2. Evidence of small vessel ischemic disease.

3. Unremarkable CTA of the head and neck, with no evidence of
steno-occlusive
disease.

4. No finding to suggest cerebral venous thrombosis.

CT C-Spine
FINDINGS:

There is no evidence of acute fracture or malalignment.
Multilevel
degenerative joint changes are most pronounced at C6-C7 with
intervertebral
disc space narrowing, subchondral sclerosis and disc osteophyte
complex
formations. Evaluation of prevertebral soft tissue is limited
due to ET tube
placement. No critical central canal stenosis is noted.
Calcifications of
the ligamentum flavum are incidentally noted. Nonunion of the C1
posterior
arch is present. The esophagus appears patulous with moderate
amount of
secretions, which may predispose the patient to aspiration.
Imaged lung
apices are clear.

IMPRESSION:

1. No evidence of acute fracture or malalignment. Degenerative
changes are
most pron
