Date of Birth:  [**2126-1-14**]             Sex:   F

Service: CARDIOTHORACIC

Allergies:
Keflex / Statins-Hmg-Coa Reductase Inhibitors / Sulfasalazine

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 165**]
Chief Complaint:
loss of consiousness


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
left and right heart catheterization, coronary angiogram
redo sternotomy, aortic valve replacement
(21mm CE Magma pericardial)


History of Present Illness:
The patient 73 year old white female was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] on
[**2199-2-8**] after being found collapsed in her kitchen at home. Her
husband reportedly left for work at approximately 6:30 am on
[**2-8**]. He then called his wife at 8:30 am to relay a message, and
when she did not answer the phone, he became concerned. He drove
home and found her unconscious on the kitchen floor. Per report,
he did not notice any abnormal movements, incontinence, or
tongue biting. When the paramedics arrived, she had GCS score of
5 and was intubated and transferred to [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]. There, she
had a head CT that was concerning for possible [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] she was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further care.

On arrival to [**Hospital1 18**], she was admitted to the trauma ICU, where
she was treated empirically for seizures with phenytoin. She had
a CT/CTA head, which was negative, and subsequent MRI showed a
small area of [**Hospital1 **] but no major bleed. Given the fact that the
previous CTA was normal, it was deduced that the subarachnoid
hemorrhage was traumatic rather than the cause of her collapse.
She was extubated on [**2-9**] and was then transferred to the
neurology service. [**2-10**] patient without complaints, VS notable
for SBP range: 160-197/90-100s, HRs: 90-100s, On [**2-11**] at
approximately 5 am, when she became acutely dyspneic. She was
given Lasix 10 mg IV x1 and Morphine, and EKG showed new ST
depressions in V4-V6. Cardiology was called, and she was started
on a heparin gtt. Since this time, she has received 2 more doses
of Lasix IV and was started on albuterol nebulizations for
increased dyspnea.
.
Currently, the patient is short of breath and states that she
feels like she is "drowning." Otherwise, she has no new
complaints. Cycled enzymes at that time were positive: CK: 1132
MB: 29 MBI: 2.6 Trop-T: 0.90.

DM
HTN
Liver CA
CABG x5 (4yrs ago)

Social History:
She is married, and has two children, a son who
lives in [**Name (NI) 531**] and a daughter who lives locally. She has a
three-pack per day x20 year history of smoking, quitting in
[**2177**].
She previously was employed making fuses, but has not worked
since about the time when she was 40 years old


Family History:
Her father died at a young age of a large ulcer and was an
alcoholic. Her mother died at the age of 86 of an MI and also
had diabetes. She has a brother who also has issues with low
blood counts; family is not sure of the diagnosis. Her brother
also has diabetes

Pertinent Results:
TTE:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The right atrial pressure is
indeterminate. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size
are normal. Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF
50-55%). [Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely
more depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
The estimated cardiac index is normal (>=2.5L/min/m2). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are
normal. The aortic valve leaflets are severely
thickened/deformed. There is severe aortic valve stenosis (valve
area 0.8-1.0cm2). Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets and annulus are moderately thickened. There is no
mitral stenosis. The high mean gradient is likely due to mitral
regurgitation. Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral
regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.] The
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate [2+]
tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Normal left ventricular cavity size with low normal
systolic function. Severe aortic valve stenosis. Moderate to
severe mitral regurgitation. Pulmonary artery systolic
hypertensio
.
MRI brain [**2199-2-9**]:

IMPRESSION: No evidence of acute infarct or enhancing brain
lesion. Subtle
area of hyperintensity in the right posterior frontal sulcus,
both on FLAIR
and diffusion images likely represents a small area of
subarachnoid blood
related to recent trauma. No evidence of acute intraparenchymal
hemorrhage
seen. Brain atrophy noted

[**2199-2-8**]:

CT ANGIOGRAPHY HEAD:

CT angiography of the head demonstrates exuberant calcification
and diffuse
atherosclerotic disease involving the left distal vertebral
artery in the V4
segment. The basilar artery and the right distal vertebral
artery appear
patent. In the anterior circulation mild irregularity of the
vascular
structures are seen in the anterior circulation due to
atherosclerotic disease
without high-grade stenosis. No vascular occlusion is
identified.

IMPRESSION:
1. CT angiography of the neck demonstrate diffuse
atherosclerotic disease
involving the left common carotid artery in the neck with
irregularity of
the arterial margin. Bilateral widely patent and proximal
internal carotid
arteries are noted which could be related to previous surgery.
Clinical
correlation recommended. No evidence of high-grade stenosis in
the neck.
2. CT angiography of the head demonstrates exuberant
calcification and
diffuse atherosclerotic disease involving the distal left
vertebral artery.
Mild atherosclerotic disease seen in the anterior circulation
involving middle cerebral arteries.
3. A small wedge-shaped opacity seen posteriorly in the left
upper lung could
be due to atelectasis, but clinical correlation recommended.
4. An aberrant right subclavian artery is incidentally noted.

CT C-spine: [**2199-2-8**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of fracture or malalignment.
2. Multilevel degenerative changes including moderate-to-severe
central canal narrowing secondary to disc osteophyte complexes
at C4-5 and C5-6. Narrowing of the central spinal canal
predisposes to spinal cord injury in the
