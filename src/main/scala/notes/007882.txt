HPI: This is a 64 year-old female with a history of diffuse
B-cell Lymphoma s/p 6 cycles of R-[**Hospital1 **] ([**Date range (2) 83474**]), Stage
III NSCLC  (dx on [**11-5**] apical posterior segment of the left
upper lobe mass) s/p chemoradiation with [**Doctor Last Name **]/taxol on
[**2141-12-14**], CAD s/p 3 stents [**2138**], PE x2 s/p IVC filter
(not on coumadin [**2-28**] hemoptysis), HTN who presents with
pnuemonia.  The patient reports coughing and increased sputum
over the last week.  She was treated with a 5 day course of
azithromycin as an outpatient for "bronchitis" that she finished
on Monday.  The patient reports development of fatigue and and
pleuritic left sided chest pain that started last night.  She
denied fevers, chills, or SOB.  She went to her outpatient
transfusion clinic for planned pRBC transfusion.  At clinic
today she was noted to be tachycardic to the 140's and BP was
75/50.  She was referred to the ED for further management.
.
In the ED, 99.2 130 108/85 18 85%RA.  She had a CXR that showed
a new left upper lobe opacity concerning for pneumonia.  She
also underwent a CTA that was negative for PE, but confirmed the
left upper lobe consolidation.  The patient's labs were
signficant for a leukocytosis of 13.8 and lacate of 0.7.  She
was empirically covered with Levofloxacin/Vancomycin. Her Hct
was 25.7 and received 2U pRBC.  She was also given 1.5L IVF.
She continued to be in a-flutter with RVR.  Her CE were negative
x1 and BNP 3351.  She was given tylenol and no rate controlling
agents were given.  On transfer her vitals were 99.8 132 101/70
19 100% RA
.
In the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] the patient reported feeling well without chest
pain.  She did endorse continued cough that had not resolved
after antibiotics.
.
ROS: The patient denies any fevers, chills, weight change,
nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, constipation,
melena, hematochezia, chest pain, shortness of breath,

Pertinent Results:
Studies:
ECG:  poor baseline, a-flutter with rapid ventricular rate at
130.
Imaging:
CXR:
IMPRESSION: Unchanged left hilar mass. New left upper lobe
opacity,
concerning for post obstructive pneumonia. Followup radiograph
is
recommended after completion of treatment to ensure resolution.
.
CTA:
No evidence for pulmonary embolism. New left upper lobe
consolidation,
concerning for pneumonia, but new or underlying mass cannot be
excluded. If
treated for pneumonia, follow-up chest imaging is recommended to
ensure
resolution and exclude new mass.
