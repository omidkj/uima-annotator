Echocardiographic Measurements
Results  Measurements  Normal Range
Left Atrium - Long Axis Dimension:  *5.4 cm  <= 4.0 cm
Left Atrium - Four Chamber Length:  4.0 cm  <= 5.2 cm
Right Atrium - Four Chamber Length:  4.1 cm  <= 5.0 cm

Left Ventricle - Ejection Fraction:  35%  >= 55%
Tricuspid Valve - Peak Velocity:  1.4 m/sec
Findings
This study was compared to the prior study of [**2134-5-10**].
LEFT ATRIUM: Marked LA enlargement.
RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Normal RA size.
LEFT VENTRICLE: Moderate regional LV systolic dysfunction. False
LV tendon (normal variant). No resting LVOT gradient.
RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size. Mild global RV free
wall hypokinesis. Paradoxic septal motion consistent with prior
cardiac surgery.
AORTA: Focal calcifications in aortic root.
AORTIC VALVE: ?# aortic valve leaflets. Mildly thickened aortic
valve leaflets. No AR.
MITRAL VALVE: Bioprosthetic mitral valve prosthesis (MVR).
Cannot assess MVR. No MR.
TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets with trivial
TR. Normal PA systolic pressure.
PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Pulmonic valve not well seen.
Significant PR.
PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.
GENERAL COMMENTS: Resting tachycardia (HR>100bpm). The rhythm
appears to be atrial fibrillation. Emergency study performed by
the cardiology fellow on call.
REGIONAL LEFT VENTRICULAR WALL MOTION:
Conclusions
The left atrium is markedly dilated. There is moderate regional
left ventricular systolic dysfunction with anteroseptal,
anterior and anterolateral wall hypokinesis. Right ventricular
chamber size is normal with mild global free wall hypokinesis.
The number of aortic valve leaflets cannot be determined. The
aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. A bioprosthetic mitral valve prosthesis
is present. The prosthesis cannot be adequately assessed. No
mitral regurgitation is seen. The estimated pulmonary artery
systolic pressure is normal. Significant pulmonic regurgitation
is seen. There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2134-5-10**],
the focal wall motion abnormality now includes the anterolateral
wall and the mitral bioprothesis is new.

   RADIOLOGY  Final Report
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2134-6-10**] 10:44 AM
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
Reason: assess for infiltrates
[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
76 year old man s/p avr/cabg explor lap
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
assess for infiltrates
HISTORY: Status post cardiac surgery.
FINDINGS: In comparison with study of [**6-7**], the pulmonary
vessels are somewhat less distinct, raising the possibility of
increasing pulmonary venous pressure. Blunting of the
costophrenic angles are again consistent with pleural fluid. The
hemidiaphragms again are not well seen, consistent with some
atelectatic changes at the bases. The central catheter and
tracheostomy tube remain in place.
IMPRESSION: Little change except possibly for some increasing
vascular congestion.
