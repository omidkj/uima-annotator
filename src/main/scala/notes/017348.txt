Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 290**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
cardiac catheterization

History of Present Illness:
65yoF with h/o COPD initially admitted to [**Hospital3 3834**] on
[**8-5**] with respiratory failure. At the time, pt had several days
of increased productive cough and progressive shortness of
breath. She required intubation in the field despite a previous
DNR/DNI. While at [**Hospital3 **], she was treated with
steroids/nebs for COPD, Ceftriaxone/Azithromax for
COPD/Pneumonia, and diuresed for question of CHF. Patient had an
elevated BNP and troponin and developed anterior ST elevations
and then TWI--thus was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for cardiac
catheterization.

notable for WBC of 17 with 57polys and 17 bands

Brief Hospital Course:
65yo F with COPD and respiratory failure transferred for cardiac
catheterization.

1)Cardiovascular:Pt underwent cardiac cath on [**8-8**], which
revealed normal coronary arteries, Mildly elevated PA pressures
(34mmHg), wedge of 12, and EF 55% with normal LV wall motion.
Pts ASA, beta blocker were discontinued by the cardiology
service, however her ACE inhibitor was continued and she was
started on verapamil for persistent tachycardia and hypertension
post extubation.

2)Respiratory Failure: Pt respiratory initially felt to be
multi-factorial with a component of CHF in addition to COPD
flare. Pt was thus diuresed aggressively, both at [**Hospital3 **]and while on the CCU service. Pt was extubated successfully on
[**8-10**], however she continued to require frequent nebulizer
treatments for the first 24h, at present she is requiring them
q4h. Steroids were continued and were reduced to 20mg of
Prednisone on the day of discharge. Our feeling is that these
could be tapered rather rapidly given the deleterious effects on
the patients glucose control and her delerium. Patient is
currently on day [**9-23**] day course of ceftriaxone to treat
presumed community acquired pneumonia, and completed a 3d course
of azithromax.

3)Leukocytosis:despite decreasing doses of steroids, the
patients WBC has increased to 33 on [**8-12**]. She has been cultured
broadly and has blood and urine cultures pending at this time.
There is no current evidence of pneumonia on her CXR. If the
patient begins to stool we will send it for C.Diff

4)Delerium:Post extubation patient was confused and
agitated--this was felt to be multifactorial and due to
hypernatremia(a peak of 151), steroids, and critical illness.
She was treated symptomatically with Haldol and Risperdal PRN
and showed continued improvement as her sodium returned to
[**Location 213**] (142 on [**8-12**]) and steroids were reduced. At the present,
she is oriented to person and place but continues to express
paranoid ideology regarding people "comming to get me."

5)Code status: Prior to intubation, patient had expressed a wish
to be DNR/I.  The events surrounding her intubation remain
unclear. A family meeting was held with the CCU staff on [**8-10**]
prior to extubation and the patient was confirmed DNR/DNI.

6)Dispo:Patient will be transferred back to [**Hospital3 7571**]as it
is closer to home and easier for her family to visit her there.
She continues to improve and will likely be ready for rehab in
the next few days.
