CHIEF COMPLAINT:   The patient was admitted to the Intensive
Care Unit status post cardiac arrest and cardiopulmonary
resuscitation.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Miss [**Known lastname 96805**] is a 77 year old
female with metastatic ovarian cancer and multiple
complications stemming from this, who presented to the
Medical Intensive Care Unit status post cardiac arrest.

Brief summary of her most recent history includes a diagnosis
of inoperable, non-chemotherapy amenable small bowel
obstruction.  She was managed medically for this and
discharged to rehabilitation facility in early [**2106-1-30**].
On [**2106-2-16**], she was noted by her family to be
unresponsive at the rehabilitation facility except to painful
stimuli, hypoxic and febrile to 104.6 F., tachycardic and
tachypneic.  She was brought to the [**Hospital1 190**] Emergency Department, and she was intubated
and started on vasopressors and antibiotics (Vancomycin,
Ceftriaxone, and Flagyl).  The antibiotics were changed to
Unasyn and Vancomycin.  She was weaned from the vasopressors
within 24 hours.

She had several brief episodes of supraventricular
tachycardia which were self limited.  She was found to have
renal failure as well, attributed to obstructive uropathy
from her intra-abdominal tumor burden, along with a small
prerenal component to the renal failure.

On [**2106-2-19**], her antibiotics were changed to Vancomycin
and Ceftazidine and on [**2106-2-21**], the antibiotics were
changed to Vancomycin and Meropenem for pneumonia -
antibiotics directed per sensitivities.  She was extubated on
[**2106-2-21**].  She also received hydrocortisone for adrenal
insufficiency.  She was diuresed and transferred to the floor
on [**2106-2-22**].  A Neurology consultation obtained on
[**2106-2-23**], had determined that the patient was able to
follow one step commands and state her name.  At that time,
her encephalopathy was attributed to her sepsis.

On [**2106-2-24**], she was found to have dark drainage from
her NG tube and was thought to be possibly blood from a
potential perforation.  Her right arm was also found to be
swollen and an upper extremity ultrasound was performed which
noted a clot it the cephalic vein.  Anti-coagulation was
deferred secondary to risk of a gastrointestinal bleed.

On [**2106-2-25**], she was found tachypneic and hypoxic, and
she was also noted to be febrile at that point.  A concern
for aspiration event was raised.  She was managed with
supplemental oxygen up to 100% non-rebreather and then weaned
downwards.  She had a small amount of ostomy output as well
as an occult blood positive NG tube drainage.  Her mental
status worsened as well, with no further response to pain or
voice, and roaming eye movements.

She was also transfused for a falling hematocrit on [**2106-2-27**], with an appropriate response.  She then experienced
transient worsening of her respiratory status over the next
several days.

On the afternoon of [**3-1**], the patient was noted to be in
respiratory distress by her family.  They alerted the Nursing
Staff who went into the patient's room and found her to gasp
one breath.  She was noted to be pulseless and
cardiopulmonary resuscitation was initiated.  A Code Blue was
called.  The patient's monitor revealed asystole.  She was
given one ampule of epinephrine, intubated and CPR was
continued.  She was then given one ampule of Atropine and
continued CPR.  After approximately five minutes of
additional CPR (15 to 20 minutes total), the monitor revealed
ventricular fibrillation.  One non-synch DC cardioversion at
300 joules was delivered.  She was also administered one
ampule of bicarbonate.  Following this, the patient was noted
to be in a narrow complex tachycardia with a systolic blood
pressure in the 110s and a palpable carotid pulse.

She was transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit on
[**2106-3-1**], for further care.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Ovarian cancer diagnosed in [**2104-11-1**], status post
debulking surgery, status post total abdominal hysterectomy,
status post omentectomy, status post sigmoid resection and
end colostomy.  She received chemotherapy including CBDCA,
Taxol, and Doxil.
2.  Status post bleeding ulcer and duodenal mass, status post
oversewing of ulcer and pyloroplasty.
3.  History of VRE and Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus
aureus (sepsis).
4.  History of malignant pleural effusion, status post
pleurodesis on two occasions.
5.  Breast cancer status post left lumpectomy in [**2093**] and
irradiation.
6.  Hypertension.
7.  Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
8.  High cholesterol.
9.  Depression.
10. Polyneuropathy.
11. Status post appendectomy.
12. History of zoster.
13. Recently (early [**2106-1-30**]) diagnosed small bowel
obstruction, tumor burden, inoperable, and not appearing to
respond to chemotherapy.
14. [**2106-1-30**] echocardiogram:  The left atrium is normal in
size.  Left ventricular wall thickness and cavity are normal.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic ( ejection
fraction of greater than 75% ).  Right ventricular chamber
size and free wall motion are normal.  The number of aortic
valve leaflets could not be determined.  The aortic valve
leaflets were mildly thickened.  There was no significant
aortic valve stenosis.  One plus aortic regurgitation was
seen.  Mitral valve leaflets were mildly thickened.  There
was no mitral valve prolapse.  Trivial mitral regurgitation
is seen.  There is no pericardial effusion noted.

ALLERGIES:   Levofloxacin and Unasyn which cause a rash.
Enalapril causes cough.

magnesium 2.9 (labs obtained during code).

ALT 24, AST 68, CK 16, alkaline phosphatase 214, total
bilirubin 3.8 (falling from 6.1).  Troponin I was less than
0.3.

An arterial blood gas obtained during the code demonstrated
7.16/73/225.

NOTABLE STUDIES:  Post code EKG demonstrated reversed on
leads of I and AVR.  No axis change, T wave inversions V3
through V6, appeared old.

Next study [**2106-3-2**], abdominal ultrasound demonstrated
no interhepatic bile duct dilatation.  There was extensive
metastatic disease noted throughout the peritoneum, unchanged
bilateral hydronephrosis.

CT scan on [**2106-2-16**]:  There was no central pulmonary
embolism.  There was a right lower lobe pneumonia noted.
There was an inflammatory posterior pleural mass on the
right, likely related to pleurodesis.  Large loculated
peritoneal fluid collections with layering internal debris,
possibly blood.  No evidence of interperitoneal abscess.
