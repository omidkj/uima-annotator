Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Penicillins / Sulfa (Sulfonamides)

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2074**]
Chief Complaint:
acute coronary syndrome

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
1. cardiac catheterization with RCA stenting


History of Present Illness:
72 y/o W with h/o CVA, carotid stenosis, MR, CAD s/p MI s/p
instent thrombosis x 2 transferred from OSH w/ ACS s/p cath
[**2125-4-26**] w/out intervention, who was planned for CABG. She was
admitted to the CCU for intensive BP and symptom monitoring and
is transferred back to the [**Hospital Unit Name 196**] service after RCA stenting which
obviated a need for CABG.
.
Pt has a hx of CAD s/p stent to RCA [**10-12**], returned w/ in-stent
thrombosis in [**11-11**] w/ RCA stent and restenosis in [**2-10**] s/p
baloon angioplasty. Pt presented to OSH w/ intermittent
left-sided chest pain over the last several days PTA which was
relieved with SL nitro. The night PTA pt had an episode of CP
that was unrelieved by SL nitro x 3 and was associated w/
diaphoresis/SOB and radiation to the LUE. She presented to
[**Hospital 1474**] Hospital where she ruled in by enzymes and was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for cath. At [**Hospital1 18**] peak CK 550, MB 88, MBI
16, trop 0.60.
.
At cath on admission, she was found to have 90% RCA ostial
stenosis that was originally not amenable to intervention at the
time; the lesion was felt to be calcified instent thrombosis.
Single-vessel CABG & MVR was planned for [**2125-4-30**].
.
Post cath, the pt had persistent CP which was relieved w/ low
dose nitro gtt w/ goal BP 100-160. She was transferred to the
CCU for monitoring and optimizaiton of BP to ensure adequate
cerebral perfusion in the context of known intracranial
stenosis.
.
She had reported no CP or SOB except for progressive exertional
dyspnea over the past year intermittently associated w/ CP. She
has had no dysuria, cough, or abd pain. She has had occasional
constipation relieved with bowel movement.

MRA [**2125-4-29**]:
Demonstrates several areas of focal narrowing/stenosis in the
middle cerebral arteries bilaterally, right greater than the
left and also in the A1 segment of the right anterior cerebral
artery. Irregular areas of narrowing is also noted in the
posterior cerebral arteries bilaterally, left greater than the
right. The study is minimally limited by motion. If clinically
warranted, a MRA may be performed when the patient is more
stable and cooperative.
.

and wall motion.
TTE ([**2-10**]): EF 56%, 3+ MR; basal portion of inferolat wall HK
.
Cath [**2-10**]: RCA 90% stenosis, s/p baloon;
Cath [**11-11**]: s/p stent to RCA [**1-10**] instent restenosis
Cath [**10-12**]: s/p RCA stent [**1-10**] 80-90% lesion
Cath [**2125-4-26**]: unsuccessful RCA stenting.
Cath [**2125-5-1**]: successful RCA stenting with Cypher DES.
1. RCA angiography demonstrated a 99% ostial RCA in-stent
restenosis.
2. Successful stenting of the ostial RCA was performed with two
3.5 x
23 mm Cypher DES.



Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 72 yo woman with progressive mitral regurgitation and
severe right coronary artery disease s/p multiple interventions
including successful stenting [**5-1**] now in need of optimization
of her medical program.
.
1. Coronary Artery Disease: Ostial RCA lesion was successfully
intervened upon [**5-1**].  The patient had an episode of exertional
dyspnea on ambulating to the bathroom earlier today but is
currently free of CP and dyspnea and doing well.  Troponin bump
[**5-2**] likely due to intervention [**5-1**].
  - Continue ASA, metoprolol, atorvastatin
  - Clopidogrel 75 mg daily x9 months
  - Added ACE-inhibitor after stenting and renal function
stable. Titrated up to 10 mg po daily and tolerated by BP.
  - Troponin and CK peaked at 1.04 and 109, have since trended
downwards.
.
2. Stroke: The patient has a known old right-sided stroke and
carotid and intracranial stenoses. At baseline, she has
bilateral upgoing toes, left facial droop, and general
left-sided sensory loss.  There are no new neurologic deficits.
Followed by neurology consultation service as inpatient.
Continue ASA, clopidogrel.
.
3. Mitral Regurgitation: Although coronary ischemia was likely
playing a role in her dyspnea, her MR is likely contributing as
well.  MR has been thought to be due to papillary muscle
stunning in the setting of myocardial ischemia as opposed to
intrinsic valvular defect.
  - Afterload reduced with lisinopril as noted above
  - No current plans for MVR
  - Goal fluid balance roughly even
.
4. DM-II: Continue RISS, insulini 70/30 [**Hospital1 **].
.
5. HTN: Control with meds as above.
.
6. NSVT: No further events on telemetry.
.
7. Asthma: Continue fluticasone/salmeterol, ipratropium.
.
8. Depression: Continue sertraline.
.
9. Neuropathic Pain: Continue gabapentin.
.
10. F/E/N: Cardiac diet/[**Doctor First Name **], check lytes daily.
.
11. Proph: hepar
