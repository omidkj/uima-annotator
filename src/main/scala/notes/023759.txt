Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1167**]
Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:

History of Present Illness:
71 yo M with ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy, LVEF of 20%,
status post CABG (LIMA to LAD single vessel) in [**2133**] and Cypher
stent placement to left circ in [**2135**]), atrial fibrillation on
Coumadin, recent GI bleed, h/o VT status post pacer and ICD
placement in [**2135**], with recent firing of ICD in [**6-18**] who
presented with worsening shortness of breath over the past two
weeks. Mr. [**Known lastname 30057**] main heart-failure symtpoms are increasing
neck and abdominal girth, which he has noticed over the past few
weeks in addition to dyspnea on exertion. He denies PND and has
stable 3-pillow orthopnea. He also noticed black colored stools
x 1 today, but denies any BRBPR, new light-headedness (has
minimal LH with standing at baseline) or LOC.
Baseline weight is 224lbs which was noted in 8/[**2138**].
.
Mr. [**Known lastname **] also c/o a pressure sensation in his abdomen
(periumbilical, constant discomfort) and is chronically
constipated. He is on already an aggressive bowel regimen and
his abdominal symptoms improve with BM.
.
On review of symptoms, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis,
fevers, chills or rigors. He denies exertional buttock or calf
pain. All of the other review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
presense of dyspnea on exertion, absence of paroxysmal nocturnal
dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or
presyncope.
.
VS in ED T97.7, HR 75, BP 91/68 RR22 O2 99% 2L Guiac negative
In ED given ASA 325mg po x1, zofran 4mg IV x2, 600mg mucomyst,
Started on dopamine 12mcg/kg/min, lasix 80mg IV. He had a CTA of
the chest to rule out PE with 600cc IVF and CT abdomen/pelvis
with 600cc IVF.
.

[**2139-8-22**] CTA CHEST, CT Abdomen and Pelvis
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence for aortic dissection or aneurysm. No evidence of
pulmonary embolus.
2. Cardiomegaly with bilateral pleural effusions and bibasilar
septal thickening likely related to CHF/fluid overload.
3. Bilateral renal hypodense lesions likely cysts though
incompletely assessed. If needed, renal ultrasound may be
obtained to further evaluate. 4. Diverticulosis without evidence
for diverticulitis.
.
.
[**2139-8-24**] ECHO:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are  normal. The left ventricular cavity is severely
dilated with severe global  hypokinesis and akinesis of the
inferior and inferolateral walls as well as  the distal
anterolaeral wall (LVEF= 20 %). No masses or thrombi are seen in
 the left ventricle.The right ventricular cavity is mildly
dilated. Right  ventricular systolic function is normal. The
ascending aorta is mildly  dilated. The aortic valve leaflets
are moderately thickened. There is severe  aortic valve stenosis
(area =0.8cm2). Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The  mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild to moderate ([**1-13**]+)
mitral  regurgitation is seen. The left ventricular inflow
pattern suggests a  restrictive filling abnormality, with
elevated left atrial pressure. There is  mild pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. The end-diastolic pulmonic  regurgitation
velocity is increased suggesting pulmonary artery diastolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2139-6-18**], the
findings are  similar (severity of mitral regurgitation may be
slightly increased).
.

[**2139-8-29**] CXR:
 FINDINGS:  A single portable image of the chest is compared to
the prior
examination dated [**2139-8-22**].  There is motion artifact slightly
degrading the
image quality.  Allowing for differences in technique there is
no significant
interval change.  An AICD is unchanged in position with intact
leads
terminating within the expected region of the right atrium and
right
ventricle.  Midline sternotomy wires are again seen.  The heart
remains
enlarged.  The lungs are grossly clear.  The bony thorax is
grossly
unremarkable.
IMPRESSION:
1.  No active disease.
2.  Stable cardiomegaly.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P:
71 yo M with end stage ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy, LVEF of
20%, atrial fibrillation,  h/o VT s/p pacer and ICD placement in

symptoms following diuresis with dopamine gtt and Lasix.
.
# Cardiac:
1. Pump: Echo [**8-24**] EF 20% with aortic stenosis (valve area 0.8)

heart failure being abdominal/neck distension and dyspnea.  He
is symptomatically improved after diuresis with dopamine and
lasix with
