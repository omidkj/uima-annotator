Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2145**]
Chief Complaint:
increased work of breathing

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
- Intubation/ventilation
- Tunneled HD catheter placement
- Central line


History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 59y/o WW w/ a PMH significant for DM1 (c/b CRF,
neuropathy, and retinopathy), morbid obesity, and HTN who was
recently hospitalized for an episode of ARF [**1-14**] ATN. This
occurred in the setting of a osteomyelitis [**1-14**] an ankle fx. She
was sent back to her Rehab center following this admission and
there she developed dyspnea and anuria. Her Cr rose to 4.8 and
she had a leukocytosis at 16. She was admitted and noted to have
troponins in the 3 and was seen to have a NSTEMI but was not
anticoagulated [**1-14**] the feeling that her presentation represented
a subacute event. She required a NRB during her early admission
that was quickly weaned but, considering her fluid overload,
renal was consulted and decided to proceed to HD. During this
time, she also was noted to have a UTI that was initially
treated w/ levo/flagyl (b/c of a presumed aspiration PNA at this
time as well) but this was later changed to linezolid when it
grew VRE. On the floor, she had an episode of unresponsiveness
for which a code blue was called. She was initially pulseless
but returned to NSR w/ CPR. She was intubated during this code
during which she was also noted to have a 12b run of VT.
.
During MICU stay, pt's vent settings were weaned quickly. She
received very little sedation and was comfortable on the vent.
She was maintained on the vent for the first two days in the
MICU for her tunneled HD catheter placement and for initiation
of HD. Her line was placed on MICU day #2 in IR without
complications. HD was done the same day through the line and 1kg
was removed. Pt tolerated HD well. ON MICU day #2, she was
changed to PS 5/5 and a RSBI on MICU day #3 was 28. She was
extubated on MICU day #3 and maintained her O2 sats in high 90s.
An insulin gtt was briefly started for high blood sugars but
this was titrated off. A c. diff infection was treated w/
flagyl.
.
On ROS today, the patient complains of "labored breathing" but
denies any CP, abdominal pain, N/V, HA, weakness, paresthesias,
visual changes, or palpatations.

-CXR [**12-30**] - Lretrocardiac, R base, R upper lobe above minor
fissure opacities suggestive of atelectasis but could be

-EKG: at time of event unchanged, sinus tach
-Abd XR - [**12-29**] - Non-diagnostic bowel gas pattern.  No evidence
of small bowel obstruction.
-TTE [**2111-12-18**]: mild sym LVH. LV size normal. EF >55% with no
obvious wall motion abnormality (due to suboptimal technical
quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully
excluded). Mild pulm artery systolic HTN.
.
EMG: Complex, abnormal study. There is electrophysiologic
evidence for a severe,
ongoing, proximal myopathy with denervating features (as can be
seen in
inflammatory myopathy, critical illness myopathy or toxic
myopathy). In
addition, there is evidence for a severe, chronic, sensorimotor,
generalized
polyneuropathy with both axonal and demyelinating features, as
can be seen in
diabetics, although other causes of neuropathy cannot be
excluded

MRI:
1. There is moderate cerebral and cerebellar atrophy.
2. There are areas of abnormal signal intensity in the brain
parenchyma, the distribution of which suggests ischemic lesions
including old lacunes in the thalami, probable small, old
brainstem infarcts, and a probable old infarct in the right
internal capsule. Given the patient's age, demyelinating disease
is a consideration but the [**Doctor Last Name 352**] matter lesions are unusual.
3. There is good flow in the distal internal carotid arteries,
the distal vertebral arteries and the basilar artery. The major
branches of the cerebral arteries are normal.There is no
evidence of a significant stenosis.


Brief Hospital Course:
59F multiple ICU admissions for problem[**Name (NI) 115**] respiratory function
including repiratory arrest requiring intubation who was most
recently transferred back to the MICU on [**1-3**] with increased
secretions and decreased functional respiratory reserve,
concerning for neurologic induced weakness.  She had been
transferred out of the MICU 2 days prior ([**1-1**]) and while on
the floor was noted to have marked increased purulent sputum on
suctioning as well as increased residuals in her NG tube
concerning for obstruction.  Furthermore, while on the floor she
was continuing work-up for her subacute weakness which included
an MRI showing no cervical cord compression.  Her other medical
problems include DM type 1 (c/b CRF, neuropathy, and
retinopathy), osteomyelitis s/p fracture, morbid obesity, HTN,
CRF.  She was originally admitted for this admission from rehab
w/ volume overloaded and in renal failure. This early part of
the hospitalization was also c/b NSTEMI which was medically
managed, as well as a UTI (VRE), which was treated.
