Attending:[**Last Name (un) 11974**]
Chief Complaint:
Palpitations and NSVT

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
EP Study

History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 77-year-old female with a past history of HTN,
HL, CAD s/p MI x 3 and CABG x 2, ischemic cardiomyopathy (EF 30
%), h/o NSVT s/p ICD (replaced 2 years ago), presenting from
[**Hospital3 **] with NSVT.
.
Of note, patient was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] in [**Month (only) 956**] after ICD
firing in the setting of VT from a coughing attack.  She had
been started on amiodarone on discharge, however, this was
discontinued
in [**Month (only) 547**] secondary to tingling/twitching in her ears and a
swollen throat.  She was last seen in the device clinic in [**Month (only) 205**],
with no notable events on review.
.
She presented to [**Hospital3 **] with the initial complaint of
an episode of palpitations that she says began on Wednesday
night. She has been feeling this palpitations for a long time
(many months) but they had always gone away after a few minutes.
This episode, however, lasted for at least an hour and this is
what brought her to the OSH. She denies overt shortness of
breath, abd pain, or nausea. She denies any chest pain but does
endorse some dizziness.
.
On review of systems, she denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. She denies recent fevers, chills or
rigors. She denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the
other review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,
ankle edema, syncope or presyncope.

IMAGING
[**2149-12-1**] [**Month/Day/Year **]: The left atrium is elongated. The estimated right
atrial pressure is 0-5 mmHg. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. There is severe regional left
ventricular systolic dysfunction with thinning/akinesis of the
inferolateral wall, mild dyskinesis of the inferior wall and
apex. The remaining segments are mildly hypokinetic. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF=
25 %). No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The mitral valve
leaflets are elongated. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal.
There is no pericardial effusion. IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric
left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size with
extensive regional systolic dysfunction c/w multivessel CAD or
other diffuse process. Compared with the prior study (images
reviewed) of [**2149-3-27**], the findings are similar.
.
[**2149-12-4**] Stress Test: INTERPRETATION: This 77 yo woman s/p MI
x3, CABG in [**2126**] and [**2132**], nonsustained MMVT and s/p ICD was
referred to the lab for arrhythmia evaluation. The patient
completed 9 minutes of [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 4001**] protocol representing an
average exercise tolerance for her age; ~ 4.8 METS. The exercise
test was stopped at the patient's demand secondary to fatigue.
No chest, back, neck or arm discomforts were reported by the
patient during the procedure. The subtle ST segment changes
noted anteriorly are uninterpretable for ischemia in the
presence of the RBBB. No significant ST segment changes were
noted inferiorly or in the lateral precordial leads. The rhythm
was sinus with rare isolated APBs. In additional, rare isolated
VPBs and one ventricular couplet was noted during the procedure.
In the presence of beta blocker therapy, the heart rate response
to exercise was limited. A flat blood pressure response was
noted with exercise; resting standing 94/46 mmHg, peak exercise
104/46
mmHg. Max RPP 8112, % MAX HRT RATE ACHIEVED:  55
IMPRESSION: Average exercise tolerance, however decreased in
exercise
time/exercise tolerance from previous ETT in [**2149-3-18**]. No
anginal
symptoms or objective ECG evidence of myocardial ischemia. No
exercise-induced VT. Blunted heart rate and blood pressure
response to
exercise.
