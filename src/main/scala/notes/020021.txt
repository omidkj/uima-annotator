History of Present Illness:
52-year-old man with HCV cirrhosis, on transplant list, was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] with obtundation.

In the morning of [**2130-11-10**], patient's wife brought him to [**Name (NI) **]
Hospital in [**State 1727**] after patient had been increasingly confused
and unresponsive with mostly nonproductive coughs and fever the
night before. Was found to have hepatic encephalopathy,
hypothermia, hypotension. WBC was reportedly elevated, and Cr
2.9. Was started on moxifloxacin. Was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for
further care.

On arrival to [**Hospital1 18**], SBP was in the 80s, HR 110s, O2 sat 87% on
NRB. Patient was minimally responsive. WBC 21.8 with 22%
bandemia. Cr 2.6. Patient was emergently intubated. Femoral line
was placed. Patient was fluid resuscitated for about 5L NS. BP
improved rapidly to SBP 120s. No pressor was required. Chest CT
showed multifocal pneumonia. Received vancomycin, levoflox, and
metronidazole--patient has allergy to PCN.

Of note, patient was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] in [**2130-7-14**] with
hepatic encephalopathy and MSSA bacteremia, treated with
vancomycin, nafcillin (which caused interstitial nephritis) and
discharged on cefazolin. Subsequently patient had several
episodes of UTI with concurrent hepatic encephalopathy.


Past Medical History:
Hepatitis C Cirrhosis, awaiting transplant c/b grade 2
esophageal varices
Major depression with psychotic features
