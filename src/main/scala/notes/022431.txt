CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Lower gastrointestinal bleed.

HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 75-year-old
female with multiple medical problems including history of
CVA with right hemiparesis and expressive aphasia, vascular
dementia, atrial fibrillation, status post pacemaker
implantation, and lower GI bleed in [**2151-11-24**]
secondary to diverticuli who was sent from the [**Hospital3 1761**] Center of the Aged for bright red blood per
rectum starting at about 7:00 p.m. tonight.  While in the
Emergency Department, the patient was initially found to be
Guaiac positive with red stool in the vault.  She initially
had a blood pressure of 89/50 which improved to 102/49 with 2
liters of intravenous fluid.  A lavage was performed through
her PEG tube which was found to be Gastroccult negative.  An
anoscopy was performed as well which showed several large
nonbleeding hemorrhoids.

While still in the Emergency Department, Ms. [**Known lastname 18473**] had two
very large episodes of greater than 1-2 liters of bright red
blood mixed in with clots from her rectum.  Her vital signs
deteriorated and her systolic blood pressure dropped into the
60s.  She was given 7 units of packed red blood cells as well
as 7 liters of intravenous fluids and started on peripheral
pressors.  She was then transferred to the Medical Intensive
Care Unit for further management of massive lower GI bleed.

The patient was unable to provide any additional history
secondary to altered mental status and baseline aphasia.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Cerebrovascular accident with right hemiparesis and
expressive aphasia.
2.  Vascular dementia.
3.  Degenerative joint disease.
4.  Hypertension.
5.  Atrial fibrillation, status post pacemaker for sick sinus
syndrome.
6.  Chronic pain syndrome.
7.  Lower gastrointestinal bleed in [**2151-11-24**] with

8.  Depression.
9.  Hematuria with negative cystoscopy in [**2153-5-23**].
10. History of syncopal event status post pacemaker
placement.
11. Complex partial seizure disorder with an EEG on [**2154-6-24**], negative for epileptiform activity, positive for
multifocal subcortical dysfunction related to cerebrovascular
disease.
12. Positive PPD since [**2144**].
13. Diastolic CHF with a transthoracic echocardiogram in [**2154-7-23**] showing an EF of 70%.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Noncontributory.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is a permanent resident at the
[**Hospital3 **].  She is dependent
in all ADLs.  She is DNR/DNI.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Vital signs on
presentation to the Emergency Department:  Temperature 96.9,
blood pressure 89/50 which increased to 102/49 with 2 liters
of intravenous fluid; however, dropped after two large
episodes of lower GI bleed to systolics in the 60s, heart
rate went from 70 to 120, respiratory rate 18, oxygen
saturation 98% on 2 liters.  General:  The patient is
noncommunicative, responds to some commands.  HEENT:  The
oropharynx was clear.  The mucous membranes were dry.  The
neck was supple without any lymphadenopathy.  Heart:  Regular
rate to tachycardiac with no murmurs, rubs, or gallops
appreciated.  Lungs:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Abdomen:  Mildly distended with normoactive bowel sounds.
She had no masses.  Her PEG tube was clean, dry, and intact
in the left upper quadrant.  Extremities:  There were 2+
bilateral lower extremity edema at baseline.  Skin:  Intact
without any rash.  Neurologic:  She does not follow any
commands, nonverbal.  Rectal:  Bright red blood and clots
which were present in the patient's diaper.  There was active
extravasation of blood from the rectum.

LABORATORY/RADIOLOGIC DATA:  On admission, hematocrit
initially 31.5 which fell to 24 after two large
extravasations of blood from her rectum.  White count 10.5,
platelets 272,000.  Sodium 140, potassium 5.7, chloride 105,
bicarbonate 30, BUN 29, creatinine 0.7, glucose 97.  PT 12,
PTT 32, INR 1.0.

Urinalysis performed showed large blood, nitrate positive,
trace protein, many bacteria, [**7-3**] whites with preliminary
urine cultures growing out Enterococcus.

Chest x-ray showed no evidence of aspiration with diffuse
hazy increased opacity throughout the right main thorax
compared to left which was thought to be technical artifact.
There is no evidence of infiltrate on the limited study.

IMPRESSION:  This is a 75[**Hospital 4622**] nursing home resident with
multiple medical problems, as described above, who was
admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for large volume
lower GI bleed thought secondary to diverticuli.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  1.  GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED:  The patient
was initially resuscitated in the Medical Intensive Care Unit
with 7 units of packed red blood cells as well as 7 units of
crystalloid.  She was transiently on dopamine down in the
Emergency Department and switched to Neo-Synephrine upon
admission to the Medical Intensive Care Unit.  Her pressors
were discontinued and her blood pressure remained stable
after transfusion.  The patient had a small episode of repeat
bleeding episode at 2:00 p.m. on [**2155-3-29**].

The Gastroenterology Service who had been previously
following her were contact[**Name (NI) **] and recommended embolization by
Interventional Radiology.

On [**2155-3-29**], at 5:00 p.m., the patient was taken to
Interventional Radiology who showed an active bleed in a
small peripheral branch of the inferior mesenteric artery
which supplied the distal descending colon.  This bleeding
artery was catheterized and embolized with a coil.  Follow-up
angiogram after the embolization showed no evidence of
extravasation of contrast material consistent with successful
embolization of the bleeding site.

After embolization, Ms. [**Known lastname 18473**] had no repeat episodes of
significant GI bleed although she continued to have some
oozing of bright red blood which was thought consistent with
residual from her prior bleed.  Hematocrit trended down
slowly after her procedure and she was transfused an
additional 5 units of packed red blood cells throughout her
hospital stay.  In total, Ms. [**Known lastname 18473**] required 12 units of
packed red blood cells during her hospital stay.  Of these,
approximately 9 units were required for stabilization and an
additional 3 units required to stabilization prior to her
embolization and approximately 3 units were needed
postembolization.

She was placed on Protonix for prevention of recurrent
bleeding episodes.

2.  CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE:  Per transthoracic
echocardiogram in [**2154-7-23**], the patient has a history of
diastolic CHF.  Throughout her hospital stay despite
significant volume resuscitation the patient remained with
stable oxygen saturations and chronic lower extremity edema
at her baseline.  She did not require any diuresis.

3.  URINARY TRACT INFECTION:  Although the patient has a
chronic indwelling Foley and has had multiple recurrent
urinary tract infections in the past, a urinalysis was sent
on presentation due to what appeared to be excessive sediment
in her Foley catheter.  The urine culture grew out
preliminarily Enterococcus.  However, the pH of the urine was
9.  She was started on a course of Bactrim on [**2155-3-30**] for
plans to complete a seven day course for a complicated UTI.
At her rehabilitation facility, the results of the urine
culture including sensitivities of the Enterococcus as well
as possible presence of Proteus should be followed-up.  If
Proteus is found, the team suggests starting Aztreonam in
addition to the Bactrim for improved coverage.

4.  CODE STATUS:  On admission, the patient was initi
