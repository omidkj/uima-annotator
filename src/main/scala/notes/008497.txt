Service:  [**Hospital1 **]

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 81-year-old
female with a history of unilateral renal artery stenosis and
usual blood pressures in the 200s systolic over 90 diastolic
range, who was admitted to [**Hospital3 **] on [**2133-9-25**], for treatment of urinary tract infection, who on that
admission fell while walking to the bathroom and was found to
have a left subtrochanteric fracture which could not be
repaired at [**Hospital3 **], and transferred to [**Hospital1 346**] for surgery.  On admission, the
patient complained of fatigue for one week duration.  She
denied chest pain or shortness of breath, no abdominal pain,
no nausea, no vomiting, no diarrhea, no constipation.  Denied
fevers and chills, but complained of tenderness in the left
lower extremity.  The patient was admitted to the Internal
Medicine service for blood pressure control before surgery.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 97.6, blood pressure
230/61, heart rate 63, respiratory rate 18, oxygen saturation
98% on room air.  Extraocular movements intact, pupils equal,
round and reactive to light, no jugular venous distention was
noted.  The heart was regular rate and rhythm, with a II/VI
systolic ejection murmur at the left sternal border.  The
lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally.  The abdomen
was soft, nondistended, with positive  bowel sounds, with
suprapubic tenderness on examination with palpation.
Extremities showed no edema.  There was a brace on the left
lower extremity.  The left lower extremity appeared
shortened, with hip tenderness on touch.  Sensation was
grossly intact bilaterally on the lower extremities.
Strength was normal on the right, difficult to assess on the
left lower extremity secondary to discomfort of patient.

LABORATORY DATA:  White blood cell count 13.7, hematocrit
35.8.  Chest x-ray was within normal limits.
Electrocardiogram was consistent with left ventricular
hypertrophy with first degree heart block, no ST changes
noted on admission electrocardiogram.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  On [**2133-9-27**], the patient reached
blood pressure goal of 190/70, and was taken to the operating
room.  Procedure performed was left femur reduction/fixation
rod placement with no complications, with an estimated blood
loss of 360 cc.

The patient was stable on postoperative day one and two.  On
postoperative day three, at 2 A.M., the house staff was
called secondary to complaints of shortness of breath by
patient.  The patient was found to have an oxygen saturation
of 83% at that time, but denying chest pain, nausea,
vomiting, headache, or any other complaints.
Electrocardiogram showed ST elevations at V3 and V4.  Cardiac
enzymes were drawn, with a CK in the 400s and troponin
greater than 50.

The patient was taken for catheterization on [**2133-10-1**],
which showed 30% stenosis at the LMCA, 90% stenosis at the
left anterior descending, with heavily atherosclerotic aorta,
left renal artery showed mild disease, right renal artery
showed 70% stenosis.  The patient was recovering well
post-catheterization when the house staff was once again
called for complaints of shortness of breath and flushing.
Heart rate was found to be in the 150s.  Atrial fibrillation
was noted on the electrocardiogram and telemetry.  The
patient also complained of abdominal cramping followed by
dark melanotic stools, which were guaiac positive.
Hematocrit was taken, which was 23.1.

The patient was then transferred to the Medical Intensive
Care Unit and, on [**10-2**], transfused with six units of
packed red blood cells, with an improvement of hematocrit
from 23 to 33.6.  Echocardiogram was also performed on that
day, which revealed an ejection fraction of 35%.  Clinically,
the patient no longer showed signs of active bleeding, and
the decision was made to defer an esophagogastroduodenoscopy
unless further signs of active bleeding were noticed.

On [**10-3**], the patient remained stable.  The nasogastric
tube was removed, and decision was made to transfer the
patient to the regular floor once a bed was available.  The
patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 139**] Medicine on [**2133-10-7**].

On [**2133-10-8**], urine culture was shown to grow
gram-negative rods.  The patient was started on Cipro
antibiotic.  Also on [**2133-10-8**], decision was made
that the patient was medically stable to be discharged to
rehabilitation.  The patient is to go to [**Hospital 38**]
Rehabilitation on [**Last Name (LF) 2974**], [**2133-10-9**].
