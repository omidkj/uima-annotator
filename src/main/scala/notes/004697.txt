Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3266**]
Chief Complaint:
Abdominal Pain, Fevers, Diarrhea


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 55 year old male with ulcerative colitis,
primary sclerosing cholangitis, and cirrhosis who presents s/p
pullback cholangiogram today to evaluate for biliary drain
leakage with fever and abdominal pain.  Developed pain around
biliary drain 4-5 days ago, worsening as the week progressed.
Called [**Hospital **] clinic and was electively scheduled for [**4-9**] for
cholnagiogram to evaluate for possible biliary leak.  Last night
had fever to 101 and multiple episodes of watery diarrhea.
Awoke this a.m. with lower quadrant abdominal pain, different
from the evolving pain over the past week.  Presented to GI
suite where pullback cholangiogram was performed which showed
free passage of bile into jejunum without evidence of leak.
However, has had continued lower crampy abdominal pain every 30
minutes with max fever of 102.4 and continued diarrhea.
Diarrhea is much more frequent when compared to his UC
exacerbations (30 episodes since last night vs [**6-30**] with UC flare
vs 4 when under control).  Additionally, he never has this type
of abdominal pain with UC exacerbations.  No BRBPR or melena.
Nausea/vomited x 1 last night at MN with no repeat episodes.
Currently not nauseated.

ROS: Notes 40 pound weight loss over past 4 yrs.  No HA, URI
sxs, cough, sore throat, chest pain, SOB, orthopnea, PND,
dysuria, hesitancy, urgency.  + decreased appetitie.


Past Medical History:
# Primary sclerosing cholangitis - s/p CBD excision and
Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy.  PET scan with multiple areas of
FDG1 avidity concerning for malignancy
# Cirrhosis - Thought to be secondary to PSC; complicated by
esophageal varices - three cords with grade I varices - and
splenomegaly (liver biopsy showed bridging fibrosis, but varices
and splenomegaly suggestive of cirrhosis).
# S/p cholangiogram [**11-27**] which demonstrated irregular dilation
and stricture of the left-sided intrahepatic bile duct with no
communication to the right side.  Biliary drain placement in
[**11-27**] with biopsies that revealed fibrosis, but no evidence of a
tumor.  Replacement of his biliary tube x 1 in [**2-25**].
# ETOH abuse
# Cholecytectomy

history of heavy alcohol abuse, quit in [**2095**].

[**2106-4-9**] CXR: No effusions. No infiltrates. No free air under the
diaphragm.
.
[**2106-4-9**] Cholangiogram:
IMPRESSION:
1. Pullback cholangiogram via the existing percutaneous biliary
access into the left intrahepatic biliary duct demonstrated no
dilatation of the left intrahepatic biliary duct, minimal
filling of the nondilated side branches, and free passage of
contrast past the biliary/enteric anastomosis. No
leaking/extravasation of contrast was demonstrated.
2. Replacement of an 8 French external-internal biliary drain
with a 10 French external-internal biliary drain which was
capped.
3. The case was discussed with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 497**].
.
[**4-10**] CT Abd/pelvis:
1. New colonic thickening involving the cecum and ascending
colon up to the proximal transverse colon most consistent with
inflammation or infection. The adjacent appendix is enlarged
with intraluminal fluid and peripheral enhancement concerning
for associated appendicitis. Clinical correlation is requested.
2. New mild intraabdominal ascites.
3. [**Name (NI) 44264**] PTC drain extending from stably dilated left-sided
intrahepatic ducts into the proximal duodenum. A left-sided
periductal cystic region has increased in size from prior exam
as described above.
.
[**4-11**] CXR: Moderate-sized right pneumothorax.
.
[**4-11**] CT Abd pelvis:
1. Interval improvement in colonic wall thickening of the cecum
and ascending colon consistent with inflammation or infection.
Interval decrease in size of appendix and reduction of free
pelvic fluid.
2. New small-to-moderate right pneumothorax.
3. [**Name (NI) 44264**] PTC drain in an unchanged position, with stable
intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation.
.
[**4-12**] CXR: Marked interval improvement in previously identified
right hydropneumothorax with small residual right pneumothorax.
.
[**4-12**] Chest tube placement CXR: Moderate-to-large right
hydropneumothorax, increased in size following chest tube
replacement. Unusual cystic lucencies in right perihilar region
which could represent additional loculated areas of
pneumothorax.
.
[**4-12**] Pleural drain placement CXR: After placement of pleural
drain, there is now a combination of moderate right pneumothorax
with layering pleural effusion or hemothorax. Increase in right
basilar atelectasis
.
[**4-13**] CXR: AP chest compared to 7:35 a.m. and [**4-12**]. The tip of
the right apical pleural tube projects over a triangular lucent
area, which is probably residual pleural space containing air,
although hyperlucency in aerated lung apex distal to a row of
suture could give exactly the same appearance. The right lung is
otherwise clear. Left lung is clear. Mild rightward mediastinal
shift is stable. Heart size normal.
.
[**4-14**] CXR: Right apical pleural tube unchanged in position
projecting over a small apical pleural air collection. Small
fissural right pleural effusion increased slightly. Mild
rightward mediastinal shift stable. Left lung clear.
.
[**4-15**] CXR: Small right apical pneumothorax persists, apical
pleural tube in place. Atelectasis at the base of the right lung
which may be considerable in the lower lobe has increased since
[**4-14**]. Small right pleural effusion is unchanged. Left lung
hyperinflated and clear. Heart is top normal size.
.
[**4-16**] CXR: Persistent small, unchanged right pneumothorax
.
[**4-19**] CT Abd/pelvis: 1. Interval marked improvement in
inflammation of the right lower quadrant. 2. Dilated left-sided
biliary ducts. This is stable when compared to prior studies and
consistent with the history of PSC
3. Splenomegaly.
4. Multiple prominent mesenteric lymph nodes, some may be
slightly more prominent than before.
.
[**4-19**] CXR after removal of chest tube: Comparison to prior chest
x-ray of [**2106-4-18**] at 11:38 a.m. shows no appreciable change in
the appearance of the chest with a small persistent right apical
pneumothorax
.
[**4-21**] cholangiogram: 1. Pullback cholangiogram via the exist
