Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1253**]
Chief Complaint:
Seizure

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubated prior to arrival to [**Hospital1 18**]
Extubation on [**10-15**]

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 14163**] [**Known lastname 1007**] is a 44 year old woman with uncertain medical
history who was brought to [**Hospital3 **] Emergency Department
by police after being found intoxicated and having a seizure in
the police care.  At [**Hospital3 **] she was found to have an
alcohol level of 277 with negative serum tox screen.  While
there she had a witnessed seizure lasting less than five
minutes.  She was given Ativan IM 4 mg.  Immediately after her
seizure she was found to be hypoxic and hypotensive.  Intubation
was attempted but reportedly very difficult requiring multiple
attempts and anasthesia consult.  Patient reportedly had emesis
and hemoptysis during attempted intubation.  After intubation a
central line was placed and patient was started on levophed and
given a cetriaxone 2 mg IV. Patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for
higher acuity of care.
.
On arrival to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, vital signs were T BP 107/61 HR 72
RR 35 SpO2 76%. Labs were notable for Hct 31, etoh 128, lactate
1.0, creatinine 0.7. She underwent CT head which was negative
for an acute process.  She underwent CXR to confirm ET tube and
CVL placement which revealed bilateral infiltrates.  In the ED
he received ceftriaxone 1 g IV, Flagyl 500 mg IV x 1, levophed
and 2 L IV NS.
.
Of note patient was known to local EMS who reported a known
alcohol and seizure history.  She is currently under police
custody for domestic assault (reportly tried to stab her
boyfriend). At the OSH a nurse was able to get ahold of her
health care proxy who reported she was recently admitted to
[**Hospital 1263**] Hospital for double pneumonia.

IMAGING:
.
[**2130-10-16**] ECHO:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses and cavity size are normal. Doppler parameters are
most consistent with normal left ventricular diastolic function.
There is no ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber
size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and
no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve appears structurally
normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is no mitral
valve prolapse. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not
be determined. There is no pericardial effusion.
.
IMPRESSION: Normal global and regional biventricular systolic
function. No diastolic dysfunction or pathologic valvular
disease seen.
.
[**2130-10-14**] CXR:
1. Lines and tubes in satisfactory position.
2. Mild pulmonary vascular congestion.
3. Right upper lobe and left lower lobe atelectasis versus
aspiration.
.
[**2130-10-16**] CXR:  The patient was extubated in the meantime interval
with removal of the vent tube. The right internal jugular line
has been removed as well. There is no change in the
cardiomediastinal silhouette. Prominence of the pulmonary
arteries is redemonstrated and might be consistent with
pulmonary hypertension. The lungs are essentially clear with no
new consolidations worrisome for interval development of
infectious process. Right pleural effusion is most likely
present, small. Minimal atelectasis at the right lung base is
unchanged.
.
[**2130-10-14**] CT head:
1. No evidence of acute intracranial process.
2. Paranasal sinus disease


Brief Hospital Course:
.
46 year old woman transferred from OSH ED after presenting with
intoxication and experiencing witnessed seizure.
.
# Hypoxic respiratory failure: Initial hypoxia was likely due to
apnea during her seizure.  Patient with known history of alcohol
intoxication, witnessed seizure, emesis during attempted
intubation, and CXR findings were all suggestive of an
aspiration event.  Patient's respiratory status, however,
improved dramatically with lasix alone.  She was able to be
extubated the following day and remained afebrile, with normal
WBC making aspiration pneumonia unlikely.
.
# Seizure: Initially unclear whether patient had a primary
seizure disorder or if patient's seizure history is in the
setting of alcohol withdrawal. Patient's active intoxication
during her seizure suggests that she has an underlying seizure
disorder and her alcohol use lowered her seizure threshold.
This was later confirmed with the patient and her boyfriend.
[**Name (NI) **] was restarted on her home Zonisamide 500 mg daily and
monitored on a CIWA scale. She had no further episodes of
seizure activity during her admission.
.
# Alcohol intoxication: Patient brought into OSH ED while
intoxicated. Per EMS patient is known to them to have alcohol
dependence. Her last drink was reportedly around 7 pm on
[**2130-10-13**]. Toxicology screen positive for be
