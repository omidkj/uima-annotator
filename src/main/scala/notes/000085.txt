History of Present Illness:
This is an 81 year old gentleman with a past history of coronary
artery disease (CAD), status-post coronary artery bypass
grafting (CABG) (SVG to OM, SVG to RCA and LIMA, [**7-/2140**]) who
underwent elective right total hip replacement on [**2144-8-25**]. His
post-operative course was complicated by anginal symptoms during
physical therapy ([**2144-8-26**]). The patient was noted to have
dynamic ECG changes and CK 667, MB 12, Trop 0.11. Conservative
management, including heparin was initiated, with plan for
possible catheterization and some future point. Over the course
of the day, the patient remained borderline hypotensive and was
noted to have a decrease in urine output. Urine electrolytes
suggested a pre-renal etiology. The patient received several
litre boluses on the floor.

Subsequently, the patient continued to have low blood pressures
and was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], where he continued to received
IV fluid boluses. He was later found to have a fall in his
hematocrit from 29 to 24 and was transfused 2 units PRBC. The
patient continued to become progressively hypotensive to
systolic in 50s, despite running saline through 2 IVs as well as
PRBCs through a third. He became progressively distressed,
diaphoretic, and began complaining of substernal chest
discomfort. Code blue was called and patient was intubated.
Prior to intubation, patient had a large emesis that he was
witnessed to aspirate. He received a total of 9 litres fluid,
and had progressively escalating vasopressor requirement,
needing maximum doses of first dopamine, then neosynephrine,
then levophed. This maintained his blood pressure in systolic of
90s. ECG initially was similar to prior tracings earlier in the
day, but the patient subsequently evolved a rhythm that appeared
to be accelerated idioventricular with RBBB morphology.
Cardiology was called and bedside echocardiogram was performed.
This demonstrated some focal wall motion abnormality and
possibly some evidence of right-heart strain. Bedside LENIs were
obtained to assess for source of possible source of PE, and
these were negative. Decision was made to transfer the patient
to the cardiac catheterization laboratory for further evaluation
and management.

Cardiac cath #1 on [**2144-8-27**]:
COMMENTS:
1. Selective coronary angiography in this right dominant system
revealed three vessel coronary disease. The LMCA had a 50% in
the midsegment. The LAD had a mid-vessel occlusion with a 70%
diag1 lesion. The proximal LCX had a 60% lesion, a 70% mid
lesion and an 80% OM1 stenosis with diffuse disease noted. The
RCA was not engaged but was known to be occluded.
2. Selective conduit arteriogrpahy revealed a patent LIMA to LAD
with good collaterals to the RCA.
3. Venous conduit angiography was not performed as the SVG to
RCA and SVG to OM were known to be occluded from prior cardiac
catheterization.
4. Resting hemodynamics revealed systemic hypotension with SBP
of 109 mmHg on three IV pressor agents. Right sided and left
sided filling pressures were elevated with RVEDP of 29 mmHg and
mean PCWP of 46 mmHg. There was pulmonary arterial hypertension
with PASP of 57 mmHg. Cardiac index was preserved with CI of
3.88 l/min/m2.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Patent LIMA to LAD.
3. Elevated right and left sided filling pressures
4. Successful insertion of IABP.

Cardiac cath #2 on [**2144-8-27**]:
COMMENTS:
1.  Pulmonary angiography of the right and left pulmonary artery
demonstrated normal filling of contrast with no obvious flow
limiting pulmonary emboli.
2.  Selective angiography of the abdominal arteries demonstrated
a patent celiac, superior mesenteric artery and inferior
mesenteric artery - no obvious source for mesenteric ischemia.
3.  Successful placement of the Impella cardiac support unit
following successful removal of the intraortic balloon pump.
4.  Towards the conclusion of the case the patient experienced
an PEA cardiac arrest and was successfully resuscitated.
5.  Limited resting hemodynamics demonstrated elevated right and
left heart filling pressures along with depressed cardiac output
with an index of 1.8 L/min/m2.
6.  Pt with increasing ventilator requirements with poor
oxygenation. Switched from oxygen to nitric oxide with improved
oxygenation.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. No evidence of pulmonary emboli.
2. No evidence of mesenteric emboli.
3. Cardiogenic shock requiring multiple pressors along with
placement of an Impella cardiac support pump.  Removal of the
IABP.
4.  PEA cardiac arrest with successful resuscitation.
