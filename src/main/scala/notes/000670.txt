[**2173-9-24**]:  chest x-ray:

FINDINGS:  The lungs are clear, and the cardiomediastinal
silhouette and hila are normal.  There is no pleural effusion or
pneumothorax.  Right surgical neck humeral fracture is seen.

[**2173-9-24**]:  cat scan of the c-spine:

IMPRESSION:  Type 3 odontoid fracture involving the base of the
odontoid
process extending into the body of the axis and into the left
foramen
transversarium with a small fracture fragment off the left
superior articular surface of C2, displaced posteriorly between
the left lateral mass of C1 and left superior articular surface
of C2 and in close proximity to the expected position of
vertebral artery.  CTA of the neck is recommended for further
workup

[**2173-9-24**]:  cat scan of the head:

.  No acute intracranial process including no intracranial
hemorrhage.

2.  Nasal septum fractures with hemorrhage in the paranasal
sinuses and
inflammatory sinus disease.

[**2173-9-24**]:  cat scan of abdomen and pelvis:

IMPRESSION:
1.  Superior endplate fracture of T12 with minimal posterior
retropulsion.
2.  Right surgical neck humerus fracture without shoulder
dislocation.
3.  No other acute injuries to the chest, abdomen, and pelvis

[**2173-9-24**]:   cat scan of sinus/mandible:

IMPRESSION:  Nasoseptal fractures.  Moderate paranasal sinus
inflammatory
disease

[**2173-9-24**]:  CTA of neck:

IMPRESSION:  No evidence of vascular injury to the vertebral or
carotid
arteries.

[**2173-9-24**]:  x-ray of right forearm:

 FINDINGS:  There is a slightly impacted and medially displaced
right humeral fracture through the surgical neck without
evidence of dislocation.  There are no additional fractures
including no fractures of the right upper thorax, clavicle,
scapular, radius, or ulna.

[**2173-9-24**]:  right shoulder x-ray:

FINDINGS:  There is a slightly impacted and medially displaced
right humeral fracture through the surgical neck without
evidence of dislocation.  There are no additional fractures
including no fractures of the right upper thorax, clavicle,
scapular, radius, or ulna.

[**2173-9-24**]:  right elbow:

 FINDINGS:  There is a slightly impacted and medially displaced
right humeral fracture through the surgical neck without
evidence of dislocation.  There are no additional fractures
including no fractures of the right upper thorax, clavicle,
scapular, radius, or ulna.

[**2173-9-24**]:  MR thoracic spine:

 IMPRESSION:
1.  Mild acute compression of T11 superior endplate.
2.  No ligamentous injury.
3.  Previously noted odontoid fracture is not well visualized on
this study but subtle linear intensity change is seen. No
significant marrow edema.

[**2173-9-24**]:  MR cervical spine:

IMPRESSION:
1.  Mild acute compression of T11 superior endplate.
2.  No ligamentous injury.
3.  Previously noted odontoid fracture is not well visualized on
this study but subtle linear intensity change is seen. No
significant marrow edema.












Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the hospital after being involved in
a rollover accident. She was reported to have a GCS of 15.  Upon
admission, she was made NPO, given intravenous fluids, and
underwent imaging.  After review of the films, she was noted to
have a right humeral head fracture, type 3 DENS fracture, and a
T11 endplate compression fracture.  She was also reported to
have [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]-septal fracture. Because of the injuries, the
patient  was transferred to the trauma intensive care unit for
close monitoring and neurological checks. During her stay in the
intensive care unit, she remained hemodynamically stable on
log-roll precautions.

Neurosurgery was consulted regarding the DENS fracture and
recommended a hard collar at all times for neck immobilization.
An MRI was performed to evaluate her spinal fractures, which did
not show ligamentous injury or hematoma. A TLSO brace was
ordered for the T11 compression fracture.  Upon examination, she
was found not to have any neurological deficits related to this
fracture. Her head cat scan was normal. The orthopedic service
was consulted regarding the right humeral head fractue.  No
surgical intervention was indicated and a sling was applied for
comfort with recommendations for follow-up.  Plastic surgery
recommended out-patient follow-up for the nasal septum fracture
and she was placed on sinus precautions.

She was transferred to the surgical floor on HD # 2.  Her vital
signs remained stable.  She was tolerating a regular diet.  Her
pain medication was converted to oral analgesia. Upon arrival of
the TLSO brace, she was seen by physcial therapy and
instructions provided for the application of the brace.  Her
foley catheter was removed and she was voiding without
difficulty.

She was cleared by physical therapy for discharge home with
instructions to follow-up with the Orthopedic, Neurosurgery, and
Plastic service.
