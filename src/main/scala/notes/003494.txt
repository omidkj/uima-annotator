HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 72 year old
male with a past medical history significant for
gastrointestinal bleed, status post gastrectomy and +/-
Billroth II procedure, who was admitted to the Medical
Intensive Care Unit initially after two days of melena.

The patient was previously taking Aspirin, however, he knew
to stop this medication once the patient started to notice
that he had several episodes of melanotic stools.  The
patient was last admitted to [**Hospital6 1708**] in
[**2182-1-29**], where an esophagogastroduodenoscopy showed
questionable scar rupture or Dieulafoy's lesion causing the
patient's gastrointestinal bleed.

During this admission to [**Hospital1 188**], the patient had an esophagogastroduodenoscopy which
showed no active bleeding ulcers and they recommended
increasing the patient's dose of Protonix.  In the Intensive
Care Unit, the patient required a total of four units of
packed red blood cells.

The patient's hematocrit on admission was 26.4 and
subsequently went up to 33.4 after the four units.  The
patient remained hemodynamically stable throughout the brief
Intensive Care Unit stay and did not require any pressors.
The patient was not hypotensive at any point, nor did he
require intravenous fluid boluses.

However, on hospital day two, the patient's hematocrit
continued to fall, eventually down to 26.0.  However, on
recheck, it was 29.1.  There was no evidence of any acute
bleeding going on and it was felt that the patient would
continue to have some mild melanotic stools given the history
of gastrointestinal bleed.

The patient also spiked a temperature to 101.2 during the
Intensive Care Unit stay.  Urinalysis, chest x-ray and blood
cultures were done.  The urinalysis was negative and blood
cultures were negative.  Chest x-ray showed patchy opacities
in both the right mid and left lung zones.

Since there was no prior chest x-ray for comparison, it was
not known if these were new or old, however, it was felt that
there was no need for any antibiotics at this time.  The
patient defervesced on his own without any intervention.  It
was the feeling of the Intensive Care Unit team that the
fever may just have been from postprocedure.

The patient was transferred to the floor in stable condition
for further management of his upper gastrointestinal bleed.

FAMILY HISTORY:  The patient's mother had a history of

Father died in a motor vehicle accident.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives with his wife.  [**Name (NI) **] has
been in the United States for thirty years, was originally
fro [**Male First Name (un) 1056**].  He socially drinks alcohol and denies
tobacco use.  He works as a hospital inspector.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs on admission revealed
temperature 98.9, blood pressure 140/90, pulse 110, oxygen
saturation 100% in room air, respiratory rate 20.  In
general, the patient was an elderly Hispanic male in no
apparent distress.  Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat -
mucous membranes moist.  The oropharynx was clear.  There was
no jugular venous distention.  No lymphadenopathy.  The neck
was supple.  There were no bruits.  The chest was clear to
auscultation bilaterally, no wheezes or crackles were
appreciated.  Good air entry.  The heart revealed regular
rate and rhythm, II/VI systolic murmur at the apex radiating
to the axilla, no rubs or gallops were appreciated.  The
abdomen was soft, nontender, nondistended, positive bowel
sounds.  Extremities showed 1+ edema bilaterally and 2+
pulses bilaterally.  No clubbing or cyanosis.
Neurologically, the patient was awake, alert and oriented
times three.

LABORATORY DATA:  On admission, white blood cell count 8.0,
hematocrit 29.1, platelets 147,000, MCV 85.  Sodium 140,
potassium 2.7, chloride 105, bicarbonate 28, blood urea
nitrogen 18, creatinine 0.6, calcium 7.7, magnesium 1.5,
phosphorus 3.2.  Blood cultures times two was negative.
Urinalysis was positive for ketone, otherwise no leukocytes,
negative for nitrites.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  Gastrointestinal - The patient remained hemodynamically
stable.  He was transfused an additional two units of packed
red blood cells with an appropriate bump in his hematocrit to
32.6 prior to discharge.  The patient continued to have
episodes of melena.

The gastroenterology service thought that the patient would
continue to have episodes of melena given his history of
upper gastrointestinal bleed for approximately one week.  The
patient's Protonix was continued at 40 mg p.o. b.i.d.

The patient was subsequently restarted on his Atenolol given
the fact that the patient's blood pressure had remained
stable and the patient was not hypotensive at any point.  The
patient tolerated p.o. diet well without any nausea or
vomiting.

2.  Endocrine - The patient had a history of diabetes
mellitus.  Initially, the patient was just on regular insulin
sliding scale, however, once the patient tolerated clears as
well as regular p.o. diet, he was restarted on his usual oral
hypoglycemics that he was on as an outpatient and tolerated
those just fine.

3.  Pulmonary - Given the patient's patchy pulmonary
opacities in the left mid lung and right base, a chest CT was
done.  Chest CT showed nonspecific ground glass opacities in
the left upper lobe in the perihilar region.  The
differential included early or resolving infectious process,
asymmetric pulmonary edema, pulmonary hemorrhage or
aspiration event.  Multiple calcified mediastinal and hilar
lymph nodes.  Calcified pulmonary granulomas and splenic and
hepatic granulomas likely representing previous granulomatous
infection and enlargement of the pulmonary artery suggestive
of pulmonary hypertension. Small foreign body in the right
upper lobe.

Given these findings on chest CT, it was felt that another
PPD should be planted.  PPD was planted in the right forearm
and was checked two days after placement.  Since the patient
was eventually readmitted after discharge, PPD was found to
be 3.0 centimeters positive for induration.

After discussion with infectious disease service, it was felt
that given the patient's history of positive PPD in the past
and lack of current symptoms including fever, chills,
hemoptysis, that no treatment would be warranted given his
advanced age and increased risk from INH toxicity.  However,
the patient should have a follow-up chest CT in a few months
to follow-up those lesions.

4.  Infectious disease - The patient was not given any
antibiotics, did not have any more fevers.  Blood cultures
were negative.  The patient had a RPR drawn at some point
which was negative.  The patient's white count remained
stable.

The patient was discharged to home with follow-up with
follow-up at [**Company 191**] for [**Location (un) 1131**] of his PPD , however, the
patient was readmitted.  Apparently the patient has a primary
care physician at [**Hospital1 **] and is
followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 30281**] at [**Last Name (un) **].  He is looking for a new
primary care physician.  [**Name10 (NameIs) **] will be decided after
discharge.
