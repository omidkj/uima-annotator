Chief Complaint:
Nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
ERCP and sphincterotomy
Percutaneous biliary drain s/p removal


History of Present Illness:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 6680**] is a [**Age over 90 **] yo F with a history of COPD, depression,
TIA, GERD, left CEA, HTN, macular degeneration, who was referred
to [**Hospital1 18**] ED for further management of abdominal pain and
elevated liver enzymes.

She was in her usual state of health yesterday before developing
sudden onset of severe right upper quadrant pain at 7pm, which
was constant, nonradiating, and accompanied by multiple episodes
of vomiting over the course of the night. She was diaphoretic
and reported a pressure sensation extending essentially from
neck to her lower abdomen.  She denies previous similar
episodes, and has no history of biliary disease though two
daughters are s/p cholecystectomy.  She subsequently presented
to OSH ED this morning, where a CT abdomen revealed a thickened
gallbladder wall without evidence of stones. She was given
ciprofloxacin and flagyl, and was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] ED for
further management.

In the ED, her initial vitals were 99.6  84  124/69  16  96%/2L.
 She was intermittently tachycardic to >100, and a note was made
of a transiently low BP to 80s systolic, however subsequent
pressures were normal.  Her abdominal exam revealed some
guarding.  Her RUQ U/S revealed gallbladder wall thickening with
gallstones, but no evidence of CBD dilation.  Her transaminases
and AP were strikingly elevated.  Her troponin was elevated to
0.2, trending up to 0.55 prior to transfer with a CKMB elevation
to 15. She received aspirin at the OSH this morning. While her
EKG was not available on arrival to floor, note was made of ST
depressions laterally.  Surgery was consulted and recommended
perc-bili drain due to poor surgical candidacy. ERCP also
notified of case.

On the ICU floor, her VS were HR77, BP135/110, RR21, Sat
100%3LNC.  She was comfortable and denies any further abdominal
pain.  She is hungry.  No current chest pain.  On review of
systems, she denies shortness of breath, cough, sore throat,
current nausea or vomiting, jaundice, current fevers or chills,
rigors, hematuria, diarrhea, melena, hematochezia.

Brief Hospital Course:
[**Age over 90 **] yo F with a history of depression, COPD c/b pulmonary HTN not
on home O2, HTN, HLD, GERD, h/o TIA, who presented with clinical
and radiographic evidence of cholecystitis/cholangitis. Her
course has been notable for/complicated by ICU admission, sepsis
related NSTEMI, volume overload, PAF, and poor oral intake.

Hospital Course by Issue:
# CHOLECYSTITIS/CHOLANGITIS: Patient presented with RUQ pain,
nausea, and vomiting with radiographic evidence of gallbladder
wall thickening and gallstones. She also had dramatic elevations
in alk phosphatase, direct bilirubin, and transaminitis. Surgery
declined cholecystectomy based on high surgical risk, thus a
percetaneous cholecystostomy tube was placed for decompression.
Patient was started on ciprofloxacin, metronidazole, and
vancomycin for emperic coverage (given PCN allergy) for plan of
a total 14 day course. Bile fluid culture revealed Clostridium
perfringens. Percutaneous tube was self discontinued
accidentally and attempt was made to replace but there was no
longer biliary dilatation. ERCP was performed with
sphincterotomy and patient remained clinically stable on
antibiotics. She completed >2 weeks of triple antibiotics prior
to discharge.

She had a slight rise in her alkaline phosphatase during
admission but this decreased on discharge. She was discharged
pain free.

# NSTEMI: Patient had elevated troponin which trended up from
0.20 -> 0.97 and MB 15 -> 32 - >23. Patient has multiple risk
factors.  MB peaked at 32.  It was unclear whether this was a
demand event vs. an acute plaque rupture coronary syndrome. Echo
showed mild focal hypertrophy of the basal septum with mild
regional LV systolic dysfunction. Initially patient received
heparin but was later stopped in anticipation for ERCP. Patient
was started on medical therapy for CAD with aspirin, beta
blocker, low dose ACEI, and high dose statin. ASA was held for
ERCP and should be restarted [**2137-7-16**].

# COPD: Echo showed evidence of pulmonary hypertension and RV
dilation with systolic dysfunction as well as severe TR likely
[**2-13**] COPD. She was started on Spiriva as she was not on any
medical therapy for her COPD prior to admission. However, it is
unclear whether pulmonary HTN is due solely to COPD as patient
has not been hypoxic.
.
#CHF, acute on chronic, R>L sided sxs, preserved LVEF w
diastolic dysfunction:  She has diastolic dysfcuntion based on
[**2134**] TTE. Her volume was managed with prn Lasix based on
symptoms of dyspnea and orthopnea.

# DEPRESSION: This seems to have worsened over the course of her
hospitalization. Fluoxetine was continued.

# PAROXYSMAL ATRIAL FIBRILLATION: Given rhythm abnormality and
history of TIA patient was started on aspirin and warfarn after
discussion with family based on high CHADS2 score. These were
then held around the time of ERCP. Her rates have been well
controlled on BB and she has been intermittently in sinus
rhythm. She is at significan
