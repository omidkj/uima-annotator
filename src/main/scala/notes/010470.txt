Service: NEUROLOGY

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1838**]
Chief Complaint:
R face and arm weakness

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
IV TPA

History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 76 year old primarily-Cantonese speaking
man with vascular risk factors who was in his usual state of
health until 8:30pm this evening.  At that time, while watching
TV he felt generally weak and unwell.  He asked his wife to help
his to the bathroom; he was too ??????weak?????? to make it there, and
had
an episode of urinary incontinence  He then had the sensation of
bilateral arm (particularly shoulder) weakness and heaviness.
This sensation abated, and the patient noted R arm weakness; his
wife called EMS.

On arrival, EMS found FSG 161, BP 175/82, and an irregularly
irregular pulse.  They felt that the patient had R facial droop
and R arm weakness.  While in the ambulance, he was thought to
develop dysarthria.  He was brought to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED and a stroke
code was activated at 10:00pm.

The Neurology resident was at the bedside within minutes.  She
gave the patient an NIHSS of 3 (1 point each for R facial droop,
R pronator drift, and RUE dysmetria.)  She also felt that the
patient had a L tongue deviation.  The patient??????s wife clarified
that speech was at baseline (i.e. not newly dysarthric.)  EKG
revealed atrial fibrillation.  SBP was noted to be 190 and the
patient received 10mg IV labetolol.

Past Medical History:
Prostate enlargement
Hypertension
Hypothyroidism (s/p thyroidectomy)
Gout
(Of note, there is no known history of atrial fibrillation)


Social History:
Patient is retired.  He used to own and run a Chinese
restaurant. Primarily Cantonese speaking. Used to smoke in the
past.  Minimal EtOH.


Family History:
Father died of an MI at age 76


Physical Exam:
166/66, 98 degrees, 76 (Afib), 12, 98% RA 180lbs
(approx)
Fundoscopic examination reveals no papilledema.
There are no carotid bruits.
Heart is irregularly irregular.
Lungs are clear bilaterally.
Belly is soft and nontender.
There is no peripheral edema.  Extremities are warm and pink
with
palpable pulses.

Mental Status: The patient is awake and alert.  He knows that he
is in the hospital and that it is [**2100-8-21**].  There is normal
naming and repetition.  Patient??????s wife says he describes the
cookie jar properly in Cantonese.  Patient follows multi-step
commands properly.  His speech is fluent.  There is no neglect.

Cranial Nerves:  PERRL. EOMI.  There is a mild R facial droop in
an upper motor neuron pattern.  Facial sensation is intact to LT
and PP.  There is normal palate, gag, head turn, and shoulder
shrug function.  There is perhaps mild deviation of the tongue
to
the left on protrusion, but patient can move the tongue in all
directions.  Hearing is normal to finger rub bilaterally.

There is right pronator drift, with proximal and distal weakness
of
the right upper extremity.  Legs have full strength bilaterally.

Fine finger movements are perhaps slowed on the right.  There is
normal bulk and tone.  There are trace ankle jerks, 1+ knee
jerks, and 1+ biceps jerks bilaterally.  Patient withdraws to
Babinski testing bilaterally.

There is intact sensation to LT, PP, vibration, and
proprioception throughout except for early extinction to
vibration in the toes.

There is perhaps mild dysmetria on right FNF testing, but I
suspect this may be due to weakness.  Heal-to-shin are normal.
There is no truncal ataxia.  Gait testing was deferred.

CTA HEAD W&W/O C & RECONS Study Date of [**2100-9-3**] 10:07 PM
IMPRESSION:
1. Acute intracranial hemorrhage. Assessment for acute
infarction is limited on the present study due to motion on the
CTP study, with asymmetry in the MTT,in the temporo-occipital
lobes, question real/artifactual. MRI of the head, with
diffusion-weighted imaging can be considered, for better
assessment to exclude acute infarction. (Pt.'s susequent MRI
shows an acute infarct in the left parietal lobe, which is not
included on the CTP.
2. Extensive atherosclerotic disease involving the aortic arch,
arch vessels, common carotid artery bifurcations, proximal
cervical internal carotid arteries, cavernous carotid segments,
and distal vertebral arteries, with most significant involvement
noted in the left proximal cervical internal carotid artery,
with 50/60 percent luminal narrowing, with eccentric
calcified/noncalcified plaques- intramural and a component of
intraluminal location.
3. Approximately 50% narrowing by European criteria is seen in
the right
proximal cervical internal carotid artery. However, this appears
less than
50% by NASCET criteria. No flow limitation distally.
4. Diminutive caliber of the posterior cerebral arteries, with
prominent
posterior communicating artery on the left side. This may
represent a variant appearance, however, any component of
atherosclerotic disease associated is difficult to assess given
the diminutive caliber.
5. Multilevel degenerative changes in the cervical spine with
moderate-to-
severe spinal canal stenosis and neural foraminal narrowing most
prominent at C5-C6 level, inadequately assessed on the present
study.
6. Lucent lesion in the right parietal bone, inadequately
characterized. This can relate to part of the marrow. If there
is concern for neoplastic
etiology, bone scan can be considered.

MR HEAD W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2100-9-4**] 2:36 PM
IMPRESSION:
Signal abnormality in the left posterior parietal lobe extending
to the
frontal lobe with blood products within. Findings are suggestive
of an acute infarction with hemorrhagic transformation.
Recommend correlation with unenhanced head CT.
There is a cystic lesion in the right aspect of the sella,
recommend
correlation with dedicated imaging through the sella if
clinically indicated.

TTE (Complete) Done [**2100-9-7**] at 10:05:52 AM
Conclusions
The left atrium is elongated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF>55%). The ascending aorta is moderately dilated. The
aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened (?#). There is no
aortic valve stenosis. Mild to moderate ([**1-22**]+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The aortic regurgitation jet is eccentric
(so it is difficult to quantify). The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. No mitral regurgitation is seen. There is no
pericardial effusion.
No cardiac source of embolus (other than history of atrial
fibrillation) identified.

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2100-9-8**] 2:40 PM
IMPRESSION: Unchanged left frontoparietal hemorrhage. No
evidence for new
hemorrhage or infarction.
