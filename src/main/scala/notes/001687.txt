CT w/o contrast:
CT OF THE CHEST: Compared to prior CT from [**2109-3-26**], there
is almost mareked improvement in the diffuse bilateral
peribronchiolar opacities. Since the last exam, there is
interval developmen of a wedge-shaped area of consolidation
within the left lung base, which may represent a pneumonia,
however given its shape cannot exlude infarction. Again seen are
small bilateral pleural effusions, not significantly changed.
The heart and pericardium are unremarkable. Small mediastinal
lymph nodes are seen which do not meet CT criteria for
pathologic enlargement.

The visualized upper abdomen is unremarkable. Bone windows
demonstrate no suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesion. Surgical
clips are seen adjacent to the right crus of the diaphragm. A
right subclavian central venous catheter is seen with tip in the
distal SVC.

IMPRESSION: Compared to the prior CT from [**2109-3-26**], there
is marked improvement of the previously noted peribronchiolar
opacities within both lungs. However, there is development of a
new wedge-shaped opacity within the left lower lobe concerning
for pneumonia versus infarction. Stable bilateral small pleural
effusions.
.
CTA [**2109-4-14**]:
CT OF THE CHEST WITHOUT AND WITH IV CONTRAST: 10-mm hypodense
focus in the left thyroid lobe. No filling defects are noted
within the main pulmonary artery and its branches. The
previously described wedge-shaped opacity in the left lung base
is not seen on the current study. A rounded small pleural- based
opacity in the posterior aspect of the left lung base is seen
and unchanged when compared to a study dated [**2109-4-13**]. The
airways are patent to the segmental levels, bilaterally. Small
mediastinal and axillary lymph nodes, not pathologically
enlarged by CT criteria are again noted, unchanged. Heart and
great vessels are unchanged. No evidence of pericardial
effusions. Emphysematous changes are again seen. Diffuse mild
bilateral ground-glass opacities are unchanged when compared to
a prior study.

The liver demonstrates two small hypodensities measuring 9 mm
and 1.7 cm in segment V and VIII, respectively previously
characterized as hemagioma.

BONE WINDOWS: No suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions are
identified.

IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
2. Interval resolution of the left lower lobe wedge-shaped
opacity.

Brief Hospital Course:
A&P: 46 yo M hx T1DM, HIV, ESRD p/w dyspnea, elevated BP, low
grade fevers and cough.
.
# SOB and HTN: The patient presented to the ED with fluid
overload and hypertensive urgency and was started on a nipride
drip. On transition to the inpatient setting he was converted to
a labetalol drip to avoid buildup of cyanide biproducts while he
awaited hemodialysis. His dyspnea was well controlled on
reaching the floor and remained well controlled throughout his
hospital stay. His hypertension continued to be an issue
following his first dialysis session, despite the removal of 5.2
L of fluid during that session. He was continued on labetalol
drip to maintain SBP < 180 with 160 as target. Following his
second dialysis treatment on hospital day 2, he weighed 57kg,
which was considered his new dry weight. For improved BP
control, he was started on 20 mg Lisinopril per recommendation
of the renal team. He also continued his outpatient regimen of
160 diovan [**Hospital1 **] and 50 atenolol QD. Although his pressure was
better controlled, he still had breaks into the 180s and his
pressure control will need to be optimized as an outpatient.
.
Renal: The patient had recently transitioned from hemodialysis
to peritoneal dialysis, which was apparently insufficient,
resulting in fluid overload, hypertension and admission. The
patient was discharged with plans to resume hemodialysis at his
previous hemodialysis center under the care of his outpatient
nephrologist. His next hemodialysis treatment was scheduled for
Wed. [**4-17**].
.
HIV: The patient's HAART regimen was continued.
.
Anemia: Continue epogen at HD.
.
# Fevers: The patient briefly spiked a fever on [**4-13**] and
underwent non-con CT of the chest. He had increasing cough as
well. Sputum and blood cultures were negative. The patient's
non-con Chest CT demonstrated a peripheral wedge shaped opacity,
and the patient was started on vancomycin and zosyn, given his
relative immunosuppression and his recent hospitalization with
full course of levofloxacin. A follow-up CTA was done to rule
out PE and showed complete resolution of the wedge shaped area,
which presumably was simply atelectasis. However, the lung was
not entirely clear, and it was felt prudent to continue an [**7-19**]
day course of IV antibiotics. For this reason, the patient was
dosed one gram of ceftazadine and one gram of vancomycin
following his dialysis on [**Last Name (LF) 766**], [**4-15**] and he was written a
prescription to receive one gram of vancomycin and one gram of
ceftazadine after each of his dialysis sessions on [**4-17**] and
[**4-19**]. (and then the course would end). On the day of
discharge, the patient's nasal viral swab returned positive for
parainfluenza virus. As discussed with ID, the patient's CT and
clinical findings could all be explained by parainfluenza virus,
but there was also a significant chance for bacterial
superinfection. Thus, the antibiotic course was planned as
described above.

He was also scheduled for followup with his infectious disease
