CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Substernal chest pain

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:   Mrs. [**Known lastname 3444**] is a 52-year-old
woman with multiple medical problems, including fibromyalgia,
Type 2 diabetes, steroid-dependent chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease, who was readmitted today with severe
substernal chest pain after being discharged yesterday.  She
was readmitted most recently for chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease exacerbation and hyperglycemia.

During the last several admissions from [**3-6**] to 22 and
27 to [**3-16**], she experienced severe substernal chest pain.
She described the pain as someone "trying to pull my heart
out." Pain was not associated with nausea, vomiting,
shortness of breath, diaphoresis, nor was it pleuritic or
positional.  It does radiate to bilateral breasts, right
somewhat greater than the left.  There is also some radiation
to the right axilla.

She denies any gastroesophageal reflux disease symptoms or
increased stress or anxiety in her life.  The pain is not
exertional.  There are no symptoms of orthopnea, paroxysmal
nocturnal dyspnea.  She denies any lower extremity edema.
There are no relieving factors, although percocet and
morphine do appear to decrease the duration and severity of
the pain.  She denies shortness of breath.  Although improved
over the past several days since discharge, she does have a
chronic cough which is mainly productive of yellowish sputum.
She denies any history of fever or chills.

Of note, she did rule out for myocardial infarction on all
admissions by cardiac enzymes and troponins.  The patient had
a pharmacologic stress test in [**12-14**], in which she achieved
80% of her maximal heart rate with no wall motion
abnormality, and an ejection fraction of 66%.

The patient was then admitted to the Medical service for rule
out myocardial infarction and further management of her
chronic chest pain and severe chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, steroid requiring,
currently on a taper from previous admission; last pulmonary
function tests in [**8-14**] significant for marked ambulatory
desaturation.  FEV-1/FVC was normal; FEV-1 was 65%.
2.  Type 2 diabetes secondary to steroid use for treatment of
her chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
3.  Rheumatoid arthritis
4.  Fibromyalgia
5.  Depression
6.  Multiple admissions for atypical chest pain with negative
cardiac workup
7.  Cyst in left lower lobe documented by chest CT in [**12-14**];
also of note, she does have upper lobe emphysema
8.  Paget's disease
9.  Osteoarthritis
10. Chronic headache
11. Obstructive sleep apnea
12. Obesity

MEDICATIONS:   Prednisone taper 50 mg by mouth once daily for
five days, 40 mg by mouth once daily for five days, 30 mg by

pack per day smoking history for 15 years.  She denies any
alcohol use.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:   General:  She is an
anxious-appearing, middle-aged, African-American woman, in no
apparent distress.  Temperature 97.6, blood pressure 120/80,
heart rate 68, respiratory rate 24, oxygen saturation 98% on
2 liters.  Finger stick was 122.  Head, eyes, ears, nose and
throat:  Pupils equal, round and reactive to light,
extraocular movements intact, oropharynx clear and moist.
Neck:  Supple, no jugular venous distention, no
lymphadenopathy, no thyromegaly.  Chest:  Bibasilar rales, no
rhonchi, no wheezing.  Cardiovascular:  Regular rate and
rhythm, distant heart sounds, no murmurs, gallops or rubs.
Abdomen:  Obese; she has a midline scar; nontender,
nondistended, good bowel sounds, no hepatosplenomegaly
appreciated.  Extremities:  No edema.  She had 2+ dorsalis
pedis pulses.  Neurologically, she had no focal neurological
defects.  Strength was [**5-18**].  Her cranial nerves II through
XII were intact.

LABORATORY DATA:   Hematocrit 32.6, CPK 53, troponin less
than 0.3.  Chem 7:  Sodium 139, potassium 4.8, chloride 106,
bicarbonate 25, BUN 14, creatinine 1.0, glucose 233.  TSH
0.84.  Electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm with no
signs of ischemia or current injury.

HOSPITAL COURSE:   She was ruled out for cardiac event with
serial cardiac enzymes.  Pain consult was obtained.  They
recommended she be seen in the outpatient clinic for a
comprehensive chronic pain workup.  A Pulmonary consult was
obtained.  After reviewing the patient's chest CT, they
believed that the patient's symptoms were out of proportion
to her pulmonary disease.  They also were concerned about her
severe pulmonary hypertension found on recent echocardiogram.
As a result, they recommended that she be transferred to the
CICU for right heart catheterization and a trial of
vasodilator therapy.

On [**2110-3-21**], she was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit for
an elective right heart catheterization, the results of which
will be transcribed in an addendum to this discharge summary.
