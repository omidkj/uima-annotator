HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:   This is a 55 year old male with
a history of hypertension, unspecified heart problems, who
recently immigrated from [**Country 4812**] six weeks ago, who
presented to the Emergency Room with chest pain in the
setting of cough.  The patient, again, immigrated from
[**Country 4812**] six months ago.  Over the past six months, he has
been experiencing a dry cough; at baseline he does have some
chest discomfort as well and it seems that this pain is
exertional; however, over the last several weeks, he has
begun to have a pleuritic sharp chest pain with radiation to
the back, worse again when he coughs.

On a trip to [**Location (un) **] two weeks prior to admission, he did
complain of a similar pain and presented to a local hospital.
All the details of that hospitalization are unclear.  [**Name2 (NI) **] did
leave the hospital pain free.  The patient again came back to
the US several days ago and on the date of admission he was
in a car with his daughter when he experienced retrosternal
discomfort once again with radiation to the back.  Per the
daughter, he looked pale and diaphoretic and for this reason,
he was brought to the Emergency Room.

He denies any history of syphilis, heart murmur, scarlet
fever, Strep-throat or rheumatic fever.  He does take some
medicines for his cough but does not know what they are.

In the Emergency Room, he was noted to have a significant
diastolic murmur.  His blood pressure was elevated in the 200
to 100 range similar bilaterally.  Chest x-ray noted a large
widened mediastinum and the patient was initially placed on
labetalol and then a Nipride drip for blood pressure control.
Chest CT scan was performed which showed a large thoracic
aneurysm but no evidence of dissection, and the patient was
admitted to Coronary Care Unit for aggressive blood pressure
control.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Hypertension.
2.  Question of angina.
3.  History of negative PPD six months ago.

MEDICATIONS:
1.  Labetalol 200 twice a day.
2.  Zestril over the last week.

ALLERGIES:   No known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:   The patient is of Ethiopian origin,
recently immigrated to the US six years ago.  No tobacco or
alcohol.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:   On examination, temperature 97.3 F.;
heart rate 70; respiratory rate 18; blood pressure was
180/60; saturation of 95% on room air. In general, this is an
middle aged male in no acute distress.  HEENT:  Pupils
reactive.  Oropharynx clear.  Mucous membranes were moist.
Neck was supple.  Jugular venous pressure was not visualized.
No carotid bruits.  Chest was clear to auscultation
bilaterally.  Cardiac:  S1, S2 normal.  There was a III/VI
diastolic murmur at the right upper sternal border.  Abdomen
was benign, soft, good bowel sounds, no palpable masses.
Extremities with no edema.  Neurologically intact.  Good
motor and sensory in all extremities.  Cranial nerves intact.
Toes downgoing bilaterally.  Deep tendon reflexes symmetric.

LABORATORY:  Initial laboratory data was notable for a white
blood cell count of 7.5, hematocrit of 39.3, platelets of 259
with 13% eosinophilia.  SMA7 was notable for a creatinine of
1.3.  CK was 110; initial coagulation studies within normal
limits.  Initial EKG showed normal sinus rhythm, left
ventricular hypertrophy, left atrial abnormality.

Chest x-ray revealed a large aneurysmal mass abutting the
left hilar area.  CT scan of the chest showed a 6.6 by 6.7
centimeter large oblong descending thoracic aneurysm
compressing the left upper lobe bronchus with no evidence of
dissection, no lung masses or infiltrates.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  LARGE THORACIC ANEURYSM:  The patient was admitted with a
new diagnosis of a large thoracic aortic aneurysm without any
evidence of dissection on initial chest CT scan.  The
patient's blood pressure was aggressively managed with
Nipride drip and labetalol and eventually was transitioned
over to a PR regimen.

CT Surgery was consulted initially, however, initially they
wanted a cardiac catheterization and an echocardiogram prior
to surgery, however, they did feel that the surgery was
needed urgently.  However, due to an episode of hemoptysis
that the patient had in-house, they deferred surgery until
the patient had a bronchoscopy and was further stabilized.

Due to multiple other complications during the hospital
course, the patient's surgery was deferred and to be done
when the patient stabilized.  The patient was eventually
discharged to return for an elective surgical resection.

During the hospitalization, the patient had no evidence of
dissection or any catastrophic effects of aneurysm.

2.  HEMOPTYSIS:  The patient was initially presenting with an
aneurysm that had abutted the left upper lobe bronchus.
During the hospitalization, the patient had episodes of
hemoptysis.  Bronchoscopy which was performed showed blood
trickling from the left upper lobe bronchus, but did not
reveal any discrete masses or lesions.  The question of
fistula was entertained.  The patient, however, was intubated
electively due to recurrent hemoptysis for airway protection,
however was able to be extubated eventually and discharged.
No further hemoptysis was noted after extubation.

3.  AORTIC INSUFFICIENCY:  The patient with a loud diastolic
murmur.  A 2D echocardiogram revealed a three plus aortic
insufficiency.  Cardiac catheterization revealed no coronary
disease.  The plan was to replace the aortic valve at the
time of aneurysm repair.

4.  PNEUMONIA:  The patient developed a Hemophilus influenzae
pneumonia while on the ventilator.  The patient was treated
with a prolonged course of Levaquin for his pneumonia with
improvement.

5.  STAPHYLOCOCCUS COAGULASE NEGATIVE LINE SEPSIS:  The
patient developed Staphylococcus coagulase negative
bacteremia in the setting of peripheral line.  The patient's
line was removed and the patient was treated with a prolonged
course of intravenous Vancomycin with clearance of subsequent
blood cultures.

6.  MYOCLONIC JERKS:  The patient with myoclonic jerks
interrupted he setting of infection and medication.  He was
seen by Neurology who recommended an EEG which did not show
any evidence of epileptiform features.  The myoclonus
resolved with treatment of the infection.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Large thoracic aortic aneurysm with communication to left
upper lobe bronchus.
2.  Hemoptysis secondary to a question of aortobronchus
fistula.
3.  Aortic insufficiency.
4.  Hemophilus influenzae pneumonia.
5.  Staphylococcus line sepsis.
6.  Hypertension.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Protonix 40 q. day.
2.  Hydralazine 100 p.o. four times a day.
3.  Zestril 40 p.o. q. day.
4.  Procardia XL 90 p.o. q. day.
5.  Lopressor 100 p.o. three times a day.

DISPOSITION:   The patient was discharged on [**2125-4-26**].

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:
1.  The patient will follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (STitle) **] in CT
Surgery for an elective admission for thoracic aortic
aneurysm repair and possible aortic valve repair.
