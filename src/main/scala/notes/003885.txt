History of Present Illness:
53yo M w/ longstanding DM, IgA & diabetic nephropathy on HD,
frequent admission for fluid overload and hypertensive urgency,
who was sent to the ED from angiography today w/ BP 230/120.
The pt speaks only cantonese, therefore the interview was
conducted with his daughter interpreting & with the aid of
ED&renal notes.  Mr. [**Known lastname 724**] [**Last Name (Titles) 58901**] to the angio suite for b/l
subclavian angiography to evaluate for fistula today; at start
of porcedure SBP=200-->230/120 after procedure.  He was sent to
ED.
On arrival to ED, BP as stated above, increasing to 242/136, HR
179.  HE was given labetolol 20mg IV x 1 (w/ 2 more subsequent
doses for total of 60mg), started on a nitro drip, and given
hydralzaine 50mg po X 2, asa 325mg.  HIs ekg demonstrated TWI in
I, aVL, V4-6 & 0.5mm ST depression in I.  CE's elevated with
initial CK = 333, MB 5, trop 0.39-->253, 0.36-->222, 0.4.  CXR
revealed cardiomyopathy & mild CHF.  He was seen by renal who
did not fell he needed HD acutely.  He got a head CT to r/o
stroke, which did not demonstrate acute pathology (however, it
was limited by residual contrast from earlier study).  He was
briefly started on heparin, however, on informal discussion with
cardiology, it was felt that his increased enzymes were [**3-8**] ESRD
& CHF, therefore heparin was d/c'd.
BP decreased to 160's systolic with above medications. Txf'd to
CCU on nitro gtt.  Pt denies medication non-compliance.  Denies
CP, SOB, weakness, sensory changes.

Brief Hospital Course:
53yo male w/ HTN, DM2, IgA/DM nephropathy on HD, frequent
admissions for fluid overload and hypertensive urgency, now here
for hypertensive urgency which has improved w/ aggresive BP meds
& nitro gtt w/ associated CHF.
.
#Hypertensive urgency: the pt was asymptomatic when he was found
to have systolic pressures >200--no neurologic symptoms, no
chest pain, nor shortness of breath.  On exam, however, there
was evidence of volume overload--crackles bilaterally on
auscultation.  The pt's signs of heart failure were likely due
to hypertensive urgency as well as volume overload given his
chronic renal failure.
The pt was admitted to the CCU, where his BP was initially
lowered with IV anti-hypertensives.  Given the pt's reported
baseline SBP between 140 and 160's, a goal SBP <160 was set.
The pt was weaned off nitro gtt while his PO medications were
restarted.  His Losartan dose was increased from 25 mg to 50 mg
daily.  His dose of lisinopril was increased from 20 mg to 40 mg
daily and amlodipine 10 mg was added.  Hydralazine was
discontinued.
Regarding pt's increased cardiac enzymes, it was thought that
this was due to enzyme leak in the setting of CHF coupled with
poor enzyme clearance in the setting of CRI. He was not thought
to have ACS.
.
#ESRD: the pt was volume overloaded upon admission despite
having HD on the day prior to presentation.  Renal was consulted
and felt that the patient did not need urgent dialysis  The pt
underwent HD the morning after admission.  He was continued on
phosphate binders and EPO.
.
#DM2: He was covered with RISS and his NPH dose was halved since
he was not eating as much in the hospital.  He was discharged on
his standard insulin dosing schedule.
.
#Hypercholesterolemia: pt received his regular dose of
atorvastatin
.
#Anemia: pt has h/o anemia of chronic disease & prior GI bleed.
Not an active issue while hospitalized.  Continued EPO & iron.
.
#Diet: Of note, though pt & wife reported following low-salt
diet, the pt was seen eating high-salt food here (Chinese food
brought by his wife).  The pt & his wife may need more teaching
on what foods are low in salt.
