HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 59-year-old
woman with a past medical history of hypertension and AVNRD
who was found in the parking garage on [**2111-10-29**],
unresponsive and not moving her right side.  She was seen by
the Stroke Service who noted global aphasia, right field cut,
head which revealed a left basal ganglia bleed extending
into the temporal lobe.  The MRA demonstrated
normal flow with lateral displacement of the cerebral
branches secondary to mass affect.  She was admitted to the
Neurological Intensive Care Unit, and blood pressure was
maintained with Labetalol to a goal systolic of 140-160 mmHg.

follow-up which demonstrated the basal ganglia hemorrhage
without any further extension. After being hemodynamically and
neurologically stable for 24 hours, she was transferred to
the Neurology floor.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Asthma and gastroesophageal reflux
disease.

CURRENT MEDICATIONS:  Labetalol and Tylenol.

ALLERGIES:  AZITHROMYCIN.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  General:  She is a 59 year old women. She
was in no acute distress.  Vital signs:  She was
afebrile, blood pressure 124-118 systolic over 80-110
diastolic, heart rate 70-97, oxygen saturation 94% on room
air.  HEENT:  Normocephalic, atraumatic.  Moist mucous
membranes.  Neck:  Supple.  No appreciable carotid bruits.
Cardiovascular:  Regular, rate and rhythm.  No murmurs, rubs
or gallops.  Lungs:  Clear to auscultation.  Extremities:
Without edema.  Neurological:  The patient was alert.  She
was globally aphasic with no spontaneous speech.  She was
unable to repeat.  She could nod or shake to answer
questions.  She was able to follow midline commands but no
complex commands.  Cranial nerves revealed pupils equal,
round, and reactive to light.  There was decreased blinks to
threat from the right.  Extraocular movements intact with
spontaneous movement.  There was mild right facial droop
which becomes more evident with facial movement.  Tongue
midline.  Motor exam revealed hemiplegia
of the right upper extremity, as well as the right lower
extremity.  She was able to wiggle the toes and foot
on the right and lifted leg several inches off the bed
briefly.  The left side was full strength.  Deep tendon
reflexes 2+, slightly brisker on the right.  Plantar response
extensive on the right.  She withdraws the right leg to pinch
but no response to deep pain in the upper extremity on the
right.  She shakes her head "no" to light touch on the right.
Coordination intact with finger-nose testing on the left.

LABORATORY DATA:  Except for a WBC count of 12.3 were within
normal limits including BUN and creatinine.

Radiological exam included MRI/MRA and CT scan showing
findings consistent with left basal ganglia bleeding.
Electrocardiogram was normal sinus rhythm, left atrial
enlargement, occasional premature ventricular beats compared
to the previous tracing of [**2109**].  The left atrial enlargement
and ventricle ectopic ectopy were new.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was kept on telemetry and
intravenous Lopressor with dose adjusted according to the
blood pressure and was to be given for a systolic blood
pressure of more then 160 and held for systolic blood
pressure of less than 120.  Other medications included
Tylenol and Protonix.  Due to swallowing difficulties, the
patient was kept NPO which was discontinued on [**11-2**]
after assessment by the Swallowing Team.

Her neurological exam remained unchanged with some
improvement in comprehension.  She will be discharged to
rehabilitation with follow-up by her primary care physician and
Neurology.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  Lopressor 25 mg orally twice a day.
Repeat CT showed no increasing bleed.

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:  The patient will have a follow-up
with her primary care physician and will be discharged to
[**Hospital 38**] Rehabilitation.
