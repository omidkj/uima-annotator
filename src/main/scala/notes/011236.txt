HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname 36375**] is a
69-year-old gentleman transferred to [**Hospital1 190**] on [**2141-11-7**] for an elective coronary
artery bypass graft and aortic valve replacement from [**Hospital3 15516**] Hospital.  He was admitted to [**Hospital3 **] Hospital on the
[**10-27**] in pulmonary edema.  He subsequently ruled in
for a non-Q-wave myocardial infarction with a peak CPK of
577.  He did well at [**Hospital3 **] Hospital.  However, upon
workup, he was noted to have significant occlusion of his
carotid artery and subsequently underwent a carotid
angioplasty at [**Hospital3 **] Hospital prior to transferring him to
[**Hospital1 69**] for his coronary artery
bypass graft.

En route to the hospital, from [**Hospital3 **], Mr. [**Known lastname 36375**] became
tachycardia to the 140s in his chronic atrial fibrillation;
however, he developed shortness of breath.  The EKG did not
show ischemic changes at that time.  He was treated with IV
Lasix in transports with some improvement in his breathing.
The patient was admitted to the Cardiology Service to the
Coronary Care Unit preoperatively, due to his pulmonary
edema, upon admission.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Hypertension.
2.  Diabetes mellitus.
3.  Hypercholesterolemia.
4.  Chronic atrial fibrillation.
5.  History of transient ischemic attack ten years ago,
status post carotid angioplasty.

MEDICATIONS ON TRANSFER:  Medications on transfer from [**Hospital3 15516**] Hospital revealed the following:

1.  Enteric coated aspirin.
2.  Lisinopril 10 mg p.o.q.d.
3.  Lanoxin 0.125 mg p.o.q.d.
4.  Glyburide 2.5 mg p.o.q.d.
5.  Zocor 40 mg p.o.q.d.
6.  Lopressor 50 mg q.6h.
7.  Plavix 75 mg p.o.q.d.

ALLERGIES:  The patient states an allergy to PENICILLIN.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Examination, upon admission to the
hospital revealed the following:  Temperature 98.2; Pulse
100, atrial fibrillation; blood pressure 130/60; respiratory
rate 24; oxygen saturation 95% on four liter nasal cannula.
Physical examination was unremarkable with the exception of
jugulovenous distention, bibasilar crackles.  There was no
peripheral edema.

LABORATORY DATA:  Laboratory values on admission to the
hospital were unremarkable with the exception of a blood
glucose level of 265.  The patient was taken to the operating
room on [**2141-11-8**], by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1537**], where he underwent
coronary artery bypass graft times three with a LIMA to the
LAD, saphenous vein to the OM, saphenous vein to the RCA, as
well as an aortic valve replacement with CarpaMedics
mechanical valve.

Postoperatively, the patient was on propofol, Levophed and
Milrinone.  He was transported from the operating room to the
Cardiac Surgery Recovery Unit, where he was subsequently
weaned off the vasoactive drips.

On postoperative day #1 the patient was extubated, but
remained on an Insulin drip, and he was on low-dose Levophed
and Milrinone.

On postoperative day #2, the patient was begun on Coumadin.
He was transferred from the Cardiothoracic Intensive Care
Unit to the Telemetry Floor in stable condition.  The IV
drips had been discontinued at that time.  The patient's
chest tubes and central venous lines were discontinued.

On postoperative day #3, the patient had some difficulty
voiding and was straight catheterized for 250 cc.  The
patient was continued on his Coumadin.  The epicardial pacing
wires were discontinued, and he was begun on Lasix and
Lopressor.

On postoperative day #4, the patient had some intermittent
periods of confusion, which were increased after his evening
Percocet dose.  Hemodynamically, he remained stable.  The
patient was requiring Lasix and ultimately required Bumex to
continue diuresis.  Foley catheter had remained in, since he
had previously had difficulty voiding and his Coumadin dose
was increased because his INR had only bumped to 1.4 at this
time.

On postoperative day #5, the patient remained hemodynamically
stable.  He was increased on his Lopressor dose.  He was
begun on low-dose Captopril.  He remained on an IV Heparin
drip while waiting for his INR to become therapeutic.

On postoperative day #6, the patient remained on the
Telemetry Floor.  The patient had received one unit of packed
red blood cells overnight for a drifting hematocrit.  The
post transfusion hematocrit was 29.8.  The patient remained
on the Heparin drip, again, waiting for the INR to become
therapeutic.

On postoperative day #7, today, the patient remains
hemodynamically stable.  The INR has bumped to 2.2, and he is
ready to be discharged to a rehabilitation facility.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  The patient is afebrile, temperature
97, pulse 84 in atrial fibrillation, respiratory rate 20,
blood pressure 140/79; weight today 119.4 kg, which is up 8
kg from his preoperative weight of 111.  Neurologically, the
patient is intact.  Lungs were clear to auscultation
bilaterally.  Heart is irregular rate and rhythm.  The
sternum is stable without drainage.  Abdomen is soft,
nontender, and nondistended.  Extremities are warm and well
perfused.  He has 1+ to 2+ peripheral edema bilaterally.  The
right thigh incision has some serosanguinous drainage noted,
however, there is no erythema or purulent drainage.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Metoprolol 25 mg p.o.b.i.d.
2.  Lasix 80 mg p.o.b.i.d.
3.  Potassium chloride 20 mEq p.o.b.i.d.
4.  Colace 100 mg p.o.b.i.d.
5.  Aspirin 81 mg p.o.q.d.
6.  Glyburide 2.5 mg p.o.q.d
7.  Glucophage 1000 mg p.o.q.d.
8.  Zocor 40 mg p.o.q.d.
9.  Plavix 75 mg p.o. q.d.
10. Lanoxin 0.125 mg p.o.q.d.
11. Coumadin 7.5 mg alternating with 5.0 mg p.o.q.o.d.
12. The patient is to receive 5 mg Coumadin today on [**2141-11-15**].  He is to be dosed accordingly to a target INR of
2.5 to 3.0.
13. Percocet 5/325, 1 to 2 tablets p.o.q4-6h.p.r.n.
14. Captopril 6.25 mg p.o.t.i.d.















FOLLOW-UP CARE:  The patient is to followup with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1537**] in
three to four weeks.  The patient is to followup with his
primary care Cardiologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 34148**]/[**Last Name (un) **] upon discharge
from the rehabilitation facility and their office will be
managing his Coumadin dosing.  Their telephone #[**Telephone/Fax (1) 34149**].

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Coronary artery disease/aortic stenosis, status post
coronary artery bypass graft/aortic valve replacement.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Stable.
