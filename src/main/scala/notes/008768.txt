Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1363**]
Chief Complaint:
Hypoxia, tachycardia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none


History of Present Illness:
76yoF with a history of stage IV renal clear cell carcinoma
metastatic to the bone and lung s/p radical nephrectomy and
experimental treatment with tivozanib, HTN, HLD, and CAD s/p PCI
who is presenting with 2 days of fever and dyspnea. She reports
that on saturday she began feeling febrile and noticed that she
was becoming fatigued while performing her ADLs. On sunday and
monday she became increasingly short of breath and fatigued and
began having chills with her fever. She reports a temp of 102 on
Monday night that prompted her to contact her PCP who advised
her to go to the emergency room.
.
Patient has metastatic renal cell carcinoma and is currently
receiving therapy on a clinical trial with a novel antibody
against PD-L1. The study drug has been associated with
autoimmune sideeffects including pneumonitis, but clinical
picture in the ED was more concerning for an infectious process.
 She was started on Levaquin.
.
On [**8-15**], Pt was ready to be discharged but then developed acute
hypoxia (transisent to 80s) and tachycardia to 150. Her BP
dropped to 80s/50s (baseline 100-120/70s), with transiet O2 sat
to 80s, which resolved.  At that time, she was responsive to
command and denies CP, SOB, n/v/d, diaphoresis.  On arrival to
the MICU, patient's VS. TEMP 98.6, HR 110, BP 84/61, RR 24, 92%
on 2L.  By the time she arrived in the MICU, she has converted
back into a regular tachycardia; the only intervention she
received was vagal maneuvers.  Cardiology was consulted and
recommended starting low dose metoprolol 12.5 mg TID daily
instead of her ACEi.  She was given 1L IVF and had LE dopplers
which were negative.  At 6:30am [**8-16**], she had HR to 120's, SBP
90's, was asymptomatic, given 500 cc NS bolus with pressure
responsive to the 100s but developed crackles bilaterally.  Her
SBP improved to 100's. Her Metoprolol 12.5mg TID was changed
back to [**Hospital1 **] for low BP 88/50s later that afternoon.  She
received Lasix 20mg IV.   On [**8-17**], she completed her course of
Levofloxacin (repeat CXR showed no clear evidence of PNA) and
was called-out to the floor.  On transfer, she states that she
feels relatively well and that her breathing is stable.

[**8-12**] EKG: Sinus rhythm. Normal ECG. Compared to the previous
tracing of [**2177-7-31**] there is no significant change.

[**8-12**] CXR: IMPRESSION: Significant burden of metastatic disease
with innumerable bilateral pulmonary nodules.  Although no
definite superimposed consolidation is identified, small area of
infection would be difficult to exclude given burden of disease.


[**8-15**] ECHO: The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity
size. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and
regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened (?#). There is no
aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral
regurgitation. There is no mitral valve prolapse. The pulmonary
artery systolic pressure could not be determined. There is no
pericardial effusion. IMPRESSION: Normal global and regional
biventricular systolic function.

[**8-15**] EKG: Supraventricular tachycardia at 145 beats per minute,
likely an A-V nodal re-entrant tachycardia with pseudo S waves
in leads II, III and aVF. Compared to the previous tracing of
[**2177-8-12**] the A-V nodal re-entrant tachycardia rhythm is new.

[**8-15**] CXR: CONCLUSION: 1.  There is no pulmonary edema or new
lung consolidation. 2.  Diffuse pulmonary metastases, perhaps
mildly decreased, with some lesions that appear cavitary.

[**8-15**] LENI: Conclusion:  No evidence of DVT in right or left
lower extremity.

[**8-16**] CXR: IMPRESSION: 1.  Possible developing pneumonia within
the left lower lobe.  Consider standard PA and lateral chest
radiographs for more complete evaluation when the patient's
condition permits. 2.  Widespread pulmonary nodules and
lymphadenopathy consistent with
metastatic disease.

3.  Small bilateral pleural effusions.


Brief Hospital Course:
76 F with metastatic RCC, admitted initially for fever and pna,
was treated for CAP, and transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for acute
tachycardia and hypotension.

===== ACTIVE ISSUES =======
# Hypotension/Tachycardia: During admission, patient had two
episodes of acute onset narrow complex tachycardia and
hypotension, with EKG concerning for SVNRT or AVRT.  Vagal
maneuvers ineffective. During initial episode, patient
spontaneously converted to sinus rhythm upon transfer to the
[**Hospital Unit Name 153**]. During the second episode, she converted to sinus rhythm
after receiving 6mg of adenosine. CTA negative for PE, LENIs
negative bilaterally, ECHO elatively normal (EF > 55%) without R
heart strain. Cardiology recommended metoprolol 12.5mg [**Hospital1 **] for
rate control. Her home lisinopril was held. She was later
switched to metoprolol 25mg extended release.

# Volume overload: most likely secondary to fluid boluses though
EF > 55% without diastolic dysfunction findings on echo.
Findings are suggestive of bilateral basal crackles along with
slightly elevated JVP. She was producing adequate urine, and was
