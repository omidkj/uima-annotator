Date of Birth:   [**2089-6-30**]       Sex:  M

Service:  HEPATOBILIARY SURGERY

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:   The patient is a 58 year old
male with a past medical history remarkable for pericarditis,
diverticulosis, status post colostomy and take-down,
obstructive sleep apnea, who was evaluated for painless
jaundice in [**2147-12-6**].  The patient's CT scan revealed
1.6 by 2.0 centimeter Klatskin tumor with no evidence of
liver mass nor encasement of vessels.  The patient underwent
an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography which
showed normal pancreatic duct but biliary stricture,
consistent with cholangiocarcinoma.  A stent was placed in
the upper third of the common bile duct.  An MRCT in [**2147-12-6**], revealed a 2 centimeter mass in the porta hepatis
consistent with cholangiocarcinoma, with extensive periportal
lymphadenopathy.

After a long discussion with the patient and family members,
the patient was taken to the Operating Room on [**2148-1-22**].

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  As noted above.

MEDICATIONS:   None.

ALLERGIES:   No known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:   Positive tobacco smoker for 25 years.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:   At the time of discharge the patient
was well developed and well nourished in no apparent
distress.  HEENT:  Sclerae was icteric with evidence of
jaundice.  Cranial nerves II through XII intact.  Mucous
membranes were moist; no evidence or oral ulcers.  no
cervical lymphadenopathy noted.  Chest was clear to
auscultation bilaterally.  Cardiac is regular rhythm and
rate.  No murmurs.  Abdomen is soft, nondistended, nontender,
with lateral [**Location (un) 1661**]-[**Location (un) 1662**] intact and T-tube capped.
Extremities had two plus edema, significantly decreased since
discharge from the Surgical Intensive Care Unit; no evidence
of rash noted.

LABORATORY:  On [**2148-2-15**], white blood cell count 8.0,
hematocrit 29.9, platelets 204.  PT 14.6, PTT 51.7, INR 1.4.
Sodium 135, potassium 3.5, chloride 101, bicarbonate 24, BUN
14, creatinine 1.0 and glucose 78.  AST 102, alkaline
phosphatase 213, amylase 144/168.  Total bilirubin 7.9,
albumin 2.5, calcium 8.0, magnesium 1.8 and phosphate 3.2.

Bio-cultures from [**2-5**], Enterococcus species in yeast and
[**Location (un) 1661**]-[**Location (un) 1662**] cultures revealed Vancomycin sensitive
enterococcus.  Blood cultures from [**2-5**] showed no growth.

IMAGING:  [**2-5**], cholangiogram:  Patent anastomosis with
irregular left hepatic duct with multi-filling defects.
Leakage of contrast material from left hepatic duct leading
to a 5 centimeter fluid collection.

[**2-6**] fistulogram:  Drainage of right subhepatic
collection after manual suction of 45 cc. fluid.

[**2-6**] CT scan of abdomen:  Complete resolution of right
subhepatic collection.

SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:    The patient is a 58 year old
male who underwent an uncomplicated right hepatic lobectomy,
common bile duct excision, cholecystectomy, Roux-en-Y
hepaticojejunostomy for a Klatskin's tumor.  The patient was
admitted to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit intubated for
close observation following surgery due to prolonged surgical
time and estimated blood loss of 1200 cc..  The patient was
extubated the following morning without difficulty and the
epidural was discontinued secondary to induction of
hypertension.

The patient was placed on p.r.n. morphine with stable blood
pressure achieved after additional fluid boluses.  However,
later on during the day, the patient's hypoxemia worsened
secondary to fluid overload and required re-intubation.

During this period, the patient's white blood cell count
began to rise to 12.8, although the patient remained
afebrile.  Vancomycin and Zosyn were restarted.  A [**1-24**] culture revealed coagulase negative Staphylococcus from
blood, one out of four bottles and enterococcus fro
peritoneal drain culture.

On [**1-27**], the patient's peritoneal culture revealed
[**Female First Name (un) 564**] and Fluconazole was added.  By [**1-31**], the
patient was doing well and the patient was extubated.  With
signs of bowel function, the patient's nasogastric tube was
removed and he started on clears.  By [**2-2**], the
patient was transferred to the floor on Vancomycin after
having discontinued Zosyn and Fluconazole.

The patient had multiple fluid boluses from the Surgical
Intensive Care Unit stay resulting in three plus peripheral
edea.  Net fluid gain was noted to be greater than ten liters
at the time of transfer to the floor.  A Lasix regimen was
therefore added to target daily fluid losses to two liters.

Interestingly, the patient's total bilirubin began to rise
along with white blood cell counts.  Zosyn and Fluconazole
were added after consulting with Infectious Disease Service.
A cholangiogram was also performed on [**2-5**] and because of
the 5 centimeter fluid collection noted, Interventional
Radiology was consulted to remove the collection for culture.
With drain directly in proximity to the collection,
aggressive suctioning lead to complete evacuation of this
collection.

No additional drain was required for removal of this
collection.  White blood cell count began to decrease the
following day along with total bilirubin.  By post-op day
number 24, the patient was doing well, tolerating a regular
diet and weaned off of total parenteral nutrition.  The
decision was made to discharge the patient on [**2-16**].

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:   Good.

DISCHARGE STATUS:   To home with Visiting Nurse Service for
help administering Zosyn.

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:
1.  The patient was reminded to continue on the twice a day
Lasix regimen until Dr.[**Name (NI) 1369**] office visit in one week.  At

Lasix should be continued.
2.  The patient was also reminded to discontinue Zosyn and
Fluconazole on [**3-15**].
3.  The patient at that time was instructed to start taking
Ciprofloxacin 500 mg twice daily for prophylaxis.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Percocet 5/325, one to two tablets p.o. q. four to six
hours p.r.n. pain.
2.  Colace 100 mg p.o. three times a day.
3.  Diphenhydramine 25 mg q. h.s. p.r.n. insomnia.
4.  Reglan 10 mg, two tablets q. six hours.
5.  Lasix 40 mg p.o. twice a day.
6.  Metoprazole 40 mg p.o. q. day.

8.  Zosyn 4.5 grams q. eight hours for 28 days.
9.  Ciprofloxacin 500 mg p.o. twice a day starting [**3-15**].

FOLLOW-UP INSTRUCTIONS:
1.  The patient was instructed to follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in
seven days.
2.  The patient was also instructed to call Infectious
Disease Clinic for follow-up with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 1663**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1005**].
