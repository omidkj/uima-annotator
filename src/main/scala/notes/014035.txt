History of Present Illness:
This is a 78 year old male with known aortic stenosis since
[**2173**]. He has been followed by serial echocardiograms and has
been asymptomatic until this past year when he began to
experience progressive fatigue, shortness of breath and dyspnea

[**2184-10-27**] CXR
Comparison made to prior study of [**2184-10-24**]. There are
small bilateral pleural effusions. The lungs are otherwise
clear. Mild cardiac enlargement is present and is unchanged from
the prior study.

[**2184-10-22**] MRI/MRA Head
Diffusion images demonstrate no evidence of acute infarct. There
is no evidence of midline shift, mass effect, or hydrocephalus
seen. Mild changes of small-vessel disease are noted in the
white matter. There is mild-to-moderate brain atrophy seen.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of acute infarct.
MRA OF THE HEAD: The head MRA is somewhat limited by motion. The
MRA demonstrates no evidence of vascular occlusion or high-grade
stenosis in the arteries of anterior or posterior circulation.
IMPRESSION: Slightly motion-limited normal MRA of the head.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 18134**] was admitted on [**2184-10-12**]. The following day, he
underwent an aortic valve replacement with a 25 millimeter
pericardial tissue valve. Surgery was uneventful and he
transferred to the CSRU for invasive monitoring. Within 24
hours, he was extubated and awoke neurologically intact. He was
successfully weaned from inotropic support and transferred to
the SDU on postoperative day one. He remained somewhat
hypotensive with a low hematocrit, dropping as low as 24%. He
was concomitantly noted to have an acute decline in renal
function with creatinine peaking to 3.0 on postoperative day
five. Over several days, he received several units of packed red
blood cells with an appropriate response in blood pressure and
hematocrit. His renal function slowly improved. Due to worsening
tremulousness of his upper extremities(which was noted preop),
along with gait disturbance and hallucinations, the neurology
service was consulted. A brain MRI/MRA was essentially normal. A
full work-up as an outpatient was recommended and follow-up
appointments were scheduled. He was also noted to have
thrombocytopenia. An HIT assay was checked which was negative.
By time of discharge, his platelet count had normalized. He also
continued to have bilateral expiratory wheezes post-operatively
and required nebulizer treatments. Mr. [**Known lastname 18134**] had a run of
Atrial fibrillation on POD #9 and Amiodarone and Lopressor were
started with conversion to normal sinus rhythm. Despite him
being rather stable, he was not able to achieve a level 5 status
at POD #12. On post-op Day # 13, his Foley was re-inserted for a
post-void residual of roughly 1 liter. Flomax and proscar were
started, and he should attempt another voiding trial at rehab.
Bactrim was started for prophylactic foley coverage and
follow-up should be made with a urologist if retention
continues. The occupational therapy and physical therapy service
worked with Mr. [**Known lastname 18134**] daily. He continued to make steady
progress and was discharged to [**Hospital3 **] on
postoperative day fourteen. He will follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) **], his cardiologist, his primary care physician, [**Name10 (NameIs) **]
neurology service and the urology service as an outpatient.
