CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2197-6-8**] 8:44 AM

CHEST (PA & LAT)

Reason: eval for pleural effusions

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
59 year old man s/p AVR
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
eval for pleural effusions
INDICATION: 59-year-old male status post AVR. Please evaluate
for pleural effusions.

FINDINGS: PA and lateral chest radiographs reviewed and compared
to [**2197-6-6**]. Post-operative cardiac silhouette is stable. Right
IJ central venous catheter has been removed. Pulmonary
vascularity is normal. Mild blunting at the left costophrenic
sulcus is now noted, and there is slightly worsening left
basilar atelectasis. Lungs are otherwise clear. There is no
pneumothorax.

IMPRESSION: Increasing left basilar atelectasis, and likely
small left pleural effusion.

Findings
LEFT ATRIUM: No spontaneous echo contrast in the body of the [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **]
[**Last Name (Prefixes) **] LAA.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: A catheter or pacing wire is
seen in the RA and extending into the RV. No ASD by 2D or color
Doppler.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Wall thickness and cavity dimensions were
obtained from 2D images. Mild symmetric LVH. Moderately dilated
LV cavity. Mild-moderate global left ventricular hypokinesis.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTA: Mildly dilated ascending aorta. Focal calcifications in
ascending aorta. Simple atheroma in aortic arch. Mildly dilated
descending aorta. Complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending
thoracic aorta.

AORTIC VALVE: Three aortic valve leaflets. Severely
thickened/deformed aortic valve leaflets. Moderate-severe AS
(area 0.8-1.0cm2). Moderate (2+) AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. Mild
mitral annular calcification. Physiologic MR (within normal
limits).

TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets with trivial
TR.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflets.
No PR.

PERICARDIUM: Trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify I was present in compliance with HCFA
regulations. The patient was under general anesthesia throughout
the procedure. No TEE related complications. The patient appears
to be in sinus rhythm. Results were personally reviewed with the
MD caring for the patient. Left pleural effusion.
Conclusions
PRE CPB No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body of the
left atrium or left atrial appendage. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is
moderately dilated. There is mild to moderate global left
ventricular systolic dysfunction. Right ventricular chamber size
and free wall motion are normal. The ascending aorta is mildly
dilated. There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch. The
descending thoracic aorta is mildly dilated. There are complex
(>4mm) atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. There are
three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets are
severely thickened/deformed, particularly the left and right
coronary cusps. There is moderate to severe aortic valve
stenosis (area 0.8-1.0cm2). Moderate (2+) aortic regurgitation
is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Physiologic mitral regurgitation is seen (within normal limits).
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
was notified in person of the results in the operating room at
the time of the study.

POST CPB Normal right ventricular systolic function. Left
ventricle with continued mild to moderate global sytolic
dysfunction. A bioprosthesis is located in the aortic position.
It is well seated and displays normal leaflet function. There is
trace valvular aortic regurgitation. The maximum gradient across
the aortic valve is 54 mm Hg with a mean gradient of 36 mm Hg at
a cardiac output of 7.5 l/m. The effective orifice area of the
valve is 1.6 cm2. The thoracic aorta is intact. No other changes
from pre bypass study..
