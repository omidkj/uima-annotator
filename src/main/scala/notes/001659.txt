History of Present Illness:
The patient is an 81 y.o F with no prior documented h/o heart
disease who presented to OSH c/o 1 day h/o chest pain radiating
to left arm & jaw.  As per patient, her chest pain started one
day ago while attending funeral services.  The pain radiated to
her left arm & jaw and was accompanied by diaphoresis.  There
was no SOB or nausea.  Ms. [**Known lastname **] also denies fevers, chills,
palpitations, syncope, PND or orthopnea.
.
Ms. [**Known lastname **] reports an Exercise MIBI 3-4 years ago at [**Hospital1 392**], that
was negative.  And another ET MIBI on [**4-9**] w/ an Echo, both
were negative for heart disease.
.
Although her pain was [**10-13**], the patient attributed her symptoms
to indigestion.  She took Nexium that evening, with minimal
relief.  The pain was intermittent through the night, awakening
the patient at times from sleep.
.
On the morning of admission, Ms. [**Known lastname **] [**Last Name (Titles) 46101**] her PCP for an
EMG and reported her symptoms.  At the time, it was still
believed to be symptoms of indigestion.  However, subsequent to
the appointment, the patient's symptoms became worse and her
husband drove her to [**Hospital3 **] [**Name (NI) **].  On admission, patient
had elevated troponin I.  EKG show ST elevation with tombstoning
in II, III  &aVF, and ST depression in I, L, V1 & V2, with left
axis deviation, anterior inferior ST depression.  Ms. [**Known lastname **] was
treated with 0.4mg nitro X2 and morphine sulfate. Her blood
pressure dropped significantly when nitro was administered.
Patient was transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] for cardiac cath.
.
At [**Hospital1 18**], patient was urgently admitted to cath lab where and
RCA balloon angioplasty was performed.  Procedure was well
tolerated with no complications.  Findings showed elevated
filling pressures, mild disease in LMCA, 70% distal LAD disease,
90% occulusion of OM1 & 80%LPL, RCA was occluded prior to
balloon angioplasty.  Patient was placed on [**Last Name (LF) 70451**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] &
plavix.  Plan  to stent RCA & OM on [**11-13**].
.
ROS:
In addition to symptoms noted in HPI, Ms. [**Known lastname **] reports 5lb
weight loss in last 1 month, secondary to decreased appetite.
She denies headache, fever, chills, vomiting, diarrhea,
constipation, hematuria, dysuria, melena or dyschezia.

COMMENTS:
1) Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system
demonstrated two vessel coronary artery disease. The LMCA had
mild
disease. The LAD had 70% stenosis distally. The LCX had system
had 90%
ostial OM1 and 80% stenosis at LPL. The RCA was totally
occluded.
2) Mildly elevated right-sided pressure.
3) Left ventriculograpy was deferred.
4) RCA POBA performed with residual severe stenosis and no
reflow.
Intracoronary Diltiazem, Nitroglycerin, and Adenosin used with
marked
improvement in flow.
5) Successful PTCA of the RCA as described in the procedure
portion of this report.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Totally occluded RCA
3. Mildly elevated right-sided pressure
4. Acute inferior myocardial infarction managed by PTCA of the
RCA as
described in this report.
.
[**11-13**]: report pending, 3 stents to PDA, OM unrevascularized.


Brief Hospital Course:
This is an 81 yo F with no h/o heart disease who presented with
an inferior STEMI  s/p POBA RCA [**2144-11-12**] and 3 stents to the PDA
[**11-13**] w/no revascularization to OM1 (90% occluded).
.
1. CAD: This patient had a POBA to the RCA on [**11-12**]. The day
following the procedure, the patient had recurrent chest pain
and was taken back to the cath lab. She had a total of 3 bare
metal stents to the PDA which was complicated by PDA dissection.
There was no intervention to OM which was 90% occluded.
Additional PCI to address the OM lesion was deferred secondary
to the large CK release from the MI and the significant contrast
load and flouroscopic exposure. The patient will follow up with
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 911**] on [**2144-12-25**] for follow up and to discuss management of
her OM lesion. She will likely have either an outpatient stress
test or repeat PCI to address this lesion after optimum medical
management has been achieved. The patient received post cath
hydration for renal protection. She was started on [**Date Range **] & Plavix,
lipitor, metoprolol 25 [**Hospital1 **], and lisinopril 5 QD.
.
2. Pump: The patient had an inferior STEMI with peak CKs of
1711. An echo showed an EF 50% with hypokinesis of basal and mid
infero-lateral wall. The patient appeared euvolemic upon
discharge. She was started on a BB and ACEI for their
cardioprotective/remodelling effects. They may be titrated up as
BP allows as an outpatient.
.
3. Rhythm: The patient experienced bradycardia post MI which had
resolved upon discharge. She remained in NSR with a pulse in the
70s on metoprolol 25 [**Hospital1 **].
.
4. GERD: The patient was given protonix for GERD during her
hospitalization.
.
5. GOUT: The patient's allopurinol and colchicine were stopped
for three days secondary to the large dye load she recieved
during her two cardiac catheterizations. However, her cr was
stable throughout her stay and the allopurinol and colchicine
were restarted prior to discharge.
.
6. Anemia: The patient came in with a Hct 31.9 which dipped to a
low of 27. This was attributed to her two intravascular
procedures, blood draws, and post cath hydration. The patient
was guiac negative. Her Hct was stable at 27 upon discharge.
Iron studies were added on to the am labs on the morning of
admission and may be followed up by her PCP as an outpatient.
Her PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] was contact[**Name (NI) **] concerning her anemia
and the patient was advised to f/u with her within 1-2 weeks of
discharge.
