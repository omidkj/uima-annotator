Pertinent Results:
[**2115-7-23**] ECHO
PRE-BYPASS:
1. The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size.
No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of
the left atrium or left atrial appendage. No left atrial
mass/thrombus seen. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or
color Doppler.
2. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. There is mild
regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with anterior
apical hypokinesis. Overall left ventricular systolic function
is mildly depressed (LVEF= 45-50 %). The remaining left
ventricular segments contract normally. 3. Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
4. There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch. There are
complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
5. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no
aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen.
6. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial
mitral regurgitation is seen.
7. There is no pericardial effusion.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in person of the results.

POST-BYPASS: For the post-bypass study, the patient was
receiving vasoactive infusions including phenylephrine.

1. LVEF is preserved.
2. Aortic contours appear intact post decannulation.
3. Other findings are unchanged

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)   Clip # [**Clip Number (Radiology) 79183**]
Reason: Pleural effusion, pneumothorax.



[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
   60 year old man s/p CABG and CT removal
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
   Pleural effusion, pneumothorax.



Provisional Findings Impression: [**First Name9 (NamePattern2) 79184**] [**Doctor First Name **] [**2115-7-25**] 2:51 PM
Slightly increased basal atelectasis. Persistent left small
pleural effusion.
Low lung volumes.


Final Report (Revised)
FRONTAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH:

INDICATION: 60-year-old man post-CABG, chest tube removal.

COMPARISON: [**2115-7-23**].

FINDINGS: The patient is post-cardiac surgery. The endotracheal
tube, Swan-
Ganz catheter, chest tube, nasogastric tube, mediastinal drains
have been
removed in the interval. The lung volumes are slightly low.
There is bibasal
atelectasis and small left pleural effusion. Left retrocardiac
density is
probably due to atelectasis. Pulmonary vascularity is not
increased. There
is tiny left apical pneumothorx.

The upper abdominal loops of bowel are distended with gas, and
may correspond
to a postoperative ileus.

IMPRESSION: Possible left apical pneumothorax. Low lung volumes,
bibasal
atelectasis, and small left pleural effusion.

2) Interval removal of support devices.

The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 1968**] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2115-7-23**] for surgical
management of his coronary artery disease. He was taken to the
operating room where he underwent coronary artery bypass
grafting to three vessels. Please see operative note for
details. Postoperatively he was taken to the intensive care unit
for monitoring. Within 24 hours, he awoke neurologically intact
and was extubated. Beta blockade, aspirin and a statin were
resumed. Later on postoperative day one he was transferred to
the step down unit for further recovery. He was gently diuresed
towards his preoperative weight. The physical therapy service
was consulted for assistance with his postoperative strength and
mobility. His chest tubes were d/c'd on POD 2 and his epicardial
pacing wires were d/c'd on POD 3.  He continued to progress and
was discharged to home in stable condition on POD 4. All
necessary appointments for follow up were discussed with
Mr.[**Known lastname 1968**] prior to discharge.
