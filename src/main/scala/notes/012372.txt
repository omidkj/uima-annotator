HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 88-year-old woman
with a history of a large MCA CVA one month ago status post
PEG placement, who has been living at the [**Hospital3 1186**] with
progressive decline.

On the day of admission, the patient was found to be
lethargic with a temperature of 103.2 degrees and hypoxic.
She was started on empiric antibiotics for aspiration
pneumonia, and was tachypneic and hypoxic with minimal urine
output, and hence, was taken to [**Hospital1 **].
Patient is nonverbal on admission and could provide no
further history.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Cerebrovascular accident of middle cerebral artery.
2. Seizure.
3. Alzheimer's.
4. Lumbar stenosis.
5. Sacral decubitus ulcer.
6. Aspiration pneumonia.
7. Coronary artery disease.
8. Hypertension.
9. Degenerative joint disease.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs:  Blood pressure 117/45,
pulse 69, and satting 97% on 6 liters, respiratory rate 23,
and temperature 96.3.  General:  This is an elderly,
chronically, and acutely ill appearing woman with some
accessory musculature use, obese.  .............., but
noninfected looking decubitus sacrum to the bone.
Respiratory:  Coarse breath sounds throughout.
Cardiovascular:  Muffled by coarse breath sounds.  Pulse
regular.  Abdomen:  G tube in place, no erythema, large
belly, tender to palpation diffusely.  Extremities:
Nonedematous, dorsalis pedis pulses 1+ bilaterally.  Feet
deformed and pointed toe position.

LABORATORIES:  White count 24.6, hematocrit 38.2, platelets
582.  Sodium 132, potassium 4.1, chloride 93, bicarb 21, BUN
89, creatinine 3.2.  Glucose 137.  Urinalysis:  Moderate
leukocyte esterase, 21-50 reds, [**12-25**] whites, moderate
bacteria.

CHEST X-RAY:  Low lung volumes, cardiomegaly, pulmonary
edema, bilateral effusions.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. Respiratory failure:  This is felt to be secondary to
pulmonary edema and aspiration pneumonia.  She was diuresed
with Lasix and treated with ceftazidime, levofloxacin, and
Flagyl for nursing home acquired aspiration pneumonia.  She
had received chest physical therapy and aggressive suctioning
and nebulizers.

While on the floor, the patient became hypotensive to
systolic blood pressure 74, which responded to 1.5 liters of
IV fluids.  Patient's code status was initially DNR/DNI, but
after family discussion, the patient was made intubatable
when she was hypoxic on the floor, it was decided to transfer
to the MICU for observation.  The patient required BiPAP
overnight in the MICU, but then remained on face mask for the
rest of her stay.

The patient continued to have large amount of secretions,
which she could not clear.  On chest x-ray, mucus plugging
with subsequent lobar collapse.  After long discussion with
family, it was decided that the patient's status, status post
stroke would predispose her to recurrent aspiration events,
which she would do poorly with.  It was therefore, decided by
the family to make the patient DNR/DNI and comfort measures
only.

The patient was then transferred back to [**Hospital3 1186**] for
CMO care.

2. Acute on chronic renal failure:  The patient came in with
BUN and creatinine much above baseline.  This is felt to be
prerenal in nature given the patient's FENa and BUN and
creatinine ratio.  This improved over hospital course with
gentle IV fluids.

3. Dysrhythmia:  The patient's initial EKG was felt to
represent a third degree heart block.  EP consult was
obtained, who felt that this more likely represented
junctional rhythm with retrograde conduction, occasional
atrial flutter with variable conduction.  There was felt to
be no indication for this patient.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Fair.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  To [**Hospital 44670**] Hospital.  The patient is CMO
per discussion with family and primary care provider.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1. Scopolamine patch.
2. Morphine elixir sublingual 10 mg q.1h. prn.
3. Ativan 1 mg p.o. q.1h. prn.

FOLLOW-UP PLANS:  Patient will be followed up by her primary
care provider at the [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 44670**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].
