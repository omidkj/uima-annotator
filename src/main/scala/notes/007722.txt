Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2163-5-3**] Resection and repair of abdominal aortic aneurysm

History of Present Illness:
80-year-old lady was referred for a 5.6-cm
aneurysm of the abdominal aorta, starting just proximal to
the celiac artery and ending distal to the renal arteries.
CT angiography showed that she has some disease in her iliac
arteries, a small shrunken left kidney with an atretic left
renal artery, and a stenosis in the origin of the right renal
artery, as well as a partial stenosis in the superior
mesenteric artery.  She is in actually relatively good health
in spite of her advanced age, and after a careful discussion
about the potential risks and complications of this
operation, she agreed to proceed and was cleared from the
cardiac and pulmonary standpoints prior to this operation.

Brief Hospital Course:
[**2163-5-3**] Underwent Open AAA repair: Resection and repair of
abdominal aortic aneurysm
with 18-mm Dacron tube graft. At the end of the case, she had
anuria.
Arteriogram performed knowing that she had some right renal
artery stenosis. Left renal artery had been ligated and
sacrificed due to a small shrunken left kidney during the
repair. Right renal angioplasty and stent performed.
Transferred to PACU and then CVICU intubated. Chest tube to
suction.
[**Date range (1) 24242**] In CVICU with ICU monitoring. Electrolytes
repleted. IV lopressor. Lasix given for diuresis. Lactate and
ABGs closely followed. Extubated [**5-6**] pm.
[**5-7**] VSS, doing well in CVICU. Diet advanced. Medications
changed to po. +BS, +BM. Maintained in ICU for hemodynamic
monitoring.
[**5-8**] Neurology consult called for RT arm weakness. The current
exam suggest a peripheral nervous system involvement, possibly
at the level of the brachial plexus; exam is compounded by pain.
Brain MRI/A does not show any acute infarcts
or significant stenosis. No UE clot with dopplers. Check X-rays
of R-shoulder to r/o any coexisting dislocation etc. Suggest PT.
If symptoms fail to improve can consider imaging of the plexus
or
EMG/NCV after 3 weeks. VSS.Transfered to VICU
[**5-9**] VSS, no events. CT to water seal. Requiring 4-5L oxygen to
maintain O2 sats>90%.
[**5-10**] CDiff positive, started on Flagyl for 2 week course.
Physical therapy consulted. OOB to chair. All home medications
resumed. Tolerating regular diet. aline and telemetry
discontinued. Full PA/lat chest x-ray: No PTX. R mid-lung and L
retrocardiac atelectasis persists.
[**5-11**] VSS. No events. Continues to require oxygen, Chest tube
discontinued. Post chest x-ray showing tiny L apical PTX & b/l
PEffusions (unchanged). Telemetry discontinued, patient changed
to floor status.
[**5-12**] No overnight events. VSS. Weight obtained-67kg (60kg preop)
Given Lasix 10mg once with good results. Removed staples. CXR
