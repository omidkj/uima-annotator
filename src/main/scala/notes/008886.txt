History of Present Illness:
28 yo F who is s/p fall while skiing on [**2-15**] at which time she
reports she struck her neck on the side of a snow embankment.She
denied loss of consciousness at that time  and complained that
her ears were ringing and she was seeing spots. Immediately
after falling a paramedic was on scene from the mountain and she
was promptly placed on a back board and a cervical collar was
placed. She was transported to a hospital up there at which time
it was determined that she had a jaw fracture and her cervical
collar was discontinued and she was discharged to see an
orthopedic surgeon for treatment of the fracture.  Upon being
evaluated by the orthopod they felt she did not have a jaw
fracture and sent her home with a prescription for Vicodin.  She
continued with her vacation and complained that the Vicodin was
causing her to be nauseous and vomit.  upon coming home from her
vacation today her pain became unbearable and she presented to
[**Hospital3 2783**].  While there a CT c-spine was done which
showed that she had a right atlanto-occipital joint subluxation
with impaction as well as a possible avulsion fracture fragment
from the right side of C1 at the level of the transverse
ligament as well as multiple ligamentous tears.  She was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.

Upon Discharge

[**Location (un) 2848**] J collar in place.

Pertinent Results:
CT C-spine [**2143-2-17**]:
Rotary subluxation of C1 upon C2 with right atlanto-occipital
subluxation and no evidence of acute fracture. Clinical
correlation is recommended.
Ligamentous injury (e.g. right atlantooccipital capsule) is
likely and can be further evaluated by MRI. Focal impaction of
the right occipital condyle.

MRI C-spine [**2143-2-17**]:Right atlanto-occipital capsule-membrane
tear. right transverse lig sprain. ?right dural tear and csf
leak/ small hematoma on the right. no definite nerve root
avulsion. right occipital condyle contusion.right rotatory
subluxation of c1 on c2 and atlanto-occipital subluxation.

CTA Head and Neck [**2143-2-17**]:
1. Rotatory dislocation of C1 on C2 with anterior displacement
of superior articular facet of lateral mass on the right and
accompanying atlanto-occipital subluxation on the right with
relative posterior displacement of the occipital condyle. No
evidence of fracture or associated vascular injury. Left
atlanto-occipital joint is articulated.

2. No evidence of acute intracranial abnormality.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the ICU for Q1 hour neuro checks
after sustaining a cervical spine injury while skiing. She was
placed in a rigid cervical collar. The patient was
neurologically intact. She complained of neck pain and right jaw
pain. Additionally she had increasing headaches when her head
was elevated. CT,CTA, MRI of the cervical spine all showed
occipital-atlanto rotary subluxation.  After her injury was
discussed with several of the neurosurgeons on the team the
decision was made to perform occiput to cervical fusion.  She
was readied for the OR and on [**2-20**] was taken for occipital
cervical fusion. She recovered well post-operatively. Pain was
managed well, and she was discharged to home on [**2-23**] with follow
up instructions per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 548**].
