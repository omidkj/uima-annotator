Brief Hospital Course:
As mentioned in HPI, Ms. [**Known lastname 67223**] presented with EKG changes of
downsloping ST segment depression and T wave inversion in leads
I and aVL and ST segment depression in lead II and leads V5-V6
which were concerning for ischemia. In addition, she had
elevated cardiac biomarkers. She was started on high dose
aspirin, high dose statin, Plavix loaded and a nitroglycerin
drip.
The patient was eventually weaned off the nitroglycerin drip.
She underwent cardiac catheterization on [**12-6**] which showed
three vessel disease. Cardiac surgery was consulted and the
patient remained on the Heparin drip while waiting for her
Plavix to washout. She had the usual pre-operative work-up and
was brought to the Operating Room on [**12-13**] where she underwent a
coronary artery bypass graft x 4. Please see operative report
for surgical details. She weaned from bypass onPropofol in
stable condition.  Following surgery she was transferred to the
CVICU for invasive monitoring. Within 24 hours she was weaned
from sedation, awoke neurologically intact and extubated. Chest
tubes were removed on post-op day one and she was transferred to
the telemetry floor for further care.
Physical Therpy worked with her for mobility and strength and
she was diuresed towards her preoperative weight. Beta blockade
was begun.  Temporary pacing wires were removed per protocol.

She was discharged to home as there is family available 24 hours
a day to be with her.  Discharge medications, restrictions and
precautions were discussed prior to going home.  Wounds were
clean and healing well, she was neurologically intact.
