Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 443**]
Chief Complaint:
s/p arrest

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation

History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **]yo male nursing home resident with a history of coronary
artery disease s/p remote CABG and congestive heart failure was
admitted from his nursing home after having been found
unresponsive.
.
Patient went to go to the bathroom and started to have
"seizures." He fell to the floor and developed loss of
consciousness with pursed lip breathing. His first vital signs
were 93% O2 sat on NRB and HR 71. Per report, his initial rhythm
was thought to be a wide complex tachycardia without evidence of
pacer spikes. He underwent temporary pacing; however, shortly
afterward, he was found to have native spikes. As temporary
pacing was discontinued, he had return of his native spikes and
regular sinus rhythm.  He was intubated and then brought to the
[**Hospital1 18**] ED. Upon arrival to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, vital signs were temp
96.5, HR 71, BP 164/90, RR 19, and pulse ox 98%. His ED course
was complicated by hypotension while on propafol.
.
Review of systems could not be obtained as patient is intubated
and sedated. Of note, in previous admissions, patient was noted
to be DNR/DNI.

Brief Hospital Course:
- ECG - [**2164-2-27**] - V paced rhythm, afib, ~75 bpm, left axis
deviation
- CT Head - [**2164-2-27**] - negative for acute intracranial process
- Portable CXR - [**2164-2-27**] - Slight lucency at the left apex most
likely represents a skin fold.  However, suggest short interval
followup. Interval improvement of aeration of the left base.
Persistent right pleural effusion, cardiomegaly, and
overhydration.
- Echocardiogram [**2164-2-27**]:
The left atrium is dilated. The right atrium is moderately
dilated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy
with normal cavity size. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is severely depressed (LVEF= 25-30%). The septum is
nearly akinetic and the other basal segments moderately
hypokinetic. The apex has relatively preserved function. The
right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with mild global free
wall hypokinesis. The number of aortic valve leaflets cannot be
determined. The aortic valve leaflets are severely
thickened/deformed. There is severe aortic valve stenosis (area
<0.8cm2). Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate [2+] tricuspid
regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. Significant pulmonic regurgitation is
seen. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric LVH with severe septal hypokinesis,
moderate hypokinesis of the basal to mid segments and relative
preservation of the apical segments. The degree of aortic
stenosis is probably severe (velocity falsely LOW due to reduced
systolic function). Dilated and hypokinetic right ventricle.
Mild mitral and moderate tricuspid regurgitation with moderate
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2161-3-18**],
direct comparison is difficult as both studies are suboptimal.
Overall LV systolic function is probably similar. The right
ventricle now appears dilated and hypokinetic. The degree of
aortic stenosis has increased.

HOSPITAL COURSE:

1. Cardiac Arrest:
Etiology of the cardiac arrest is unclear. Differential
diagnosis includes arrhythmia, pacemaker malfunction, arrest
secondary to an additional medical complication such as sepsis.
No clear localizing symptoms from prior to event and no
localizing signs on exam. EP was consulted, interrogated his
ppm, and found it to be working appropriately. He is A-sensed
and V-paced when rate drops below 70bpm. Urine and blood
cultures were sent and had no growth at time of discharge. Head
CT was negative for acute process. Relatives related that he had
had a swollen and red RLE for 2 weeks without any intervention
at rehab. LENIS were obtained and showed no DVT.

2. ? PTX
Patient's CXR had a questionable PTX after intubation. Thoracic
surgery was consulted in the ED and recommended a follow-up
chest X rays with the idea that if there was in fact development
of PTX, would consider either chest tube or pigtail catheter
placement. Further CXRs showed no evidence of PTX.

3. Respiratory Failure
Patient was intubated in the setting of cardiac arrest. Patient
does not seem to have a clear diagnosis of baseline pulmonary
disease however he did have over-hydration on the CXR. AFter TTE
showed worsened EF patient was cautiously diuresed given AS. Was
weaned off the vent after only one day and tolerated nasal
canula with sats in mid-90s.  On discharge he was 98% on RA.

4. Congestive Heart Failure
Patient had a history of CHF, although when presented initally
was euvolemic. After receiving fluids he did have increased
pulmonary congestion on a CXR and decreased O2 sats so received
some diuresis with 20mg IV lasix. He was continued on his beta
blocker and digoxin (once digoxin level came back normal). He
was re-started on a low dose of his cozaar
