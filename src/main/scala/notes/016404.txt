Attending:[**Doctor First Name 1402**]
Chief Complaint:
weakness

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None this hospitalization


History of Present Illness:
This is a 80 year-old Female with a PMH significant for
pulmonary emboli (on Coumadin), pulmonary hypertension and
right-sided ventricular dysfunction, hypertension, previous TIAs
and moderate-to-severe dementia who presented from her
rehabilitation facility ([**Hospital 100**] Rehab facility) with weakness
for the last 3-days. While at rehab, she was empirically started
on Levaquin 250 mg PO daily given a leukocytosis to 12.6,
although afebrile (negative U/A).
.
EMS arrived and the patient was noted to have ST-elevations in
leads II, III and aVF. She was dosed Aspirin 324 mg PO x 1.
Nitroglycerin paste was given in the field with a drop in SBP to
the 80 mmHgs.
.
In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, initial VS 45 103/44 21 97% RA. An EKG showed
ST-evelations in lead III greater than II, avF, with reciprocal
changes in I, aVL, with TWI in V3-6 with AV-dissociation (CHB).
Cardiology was consulted and Plavix 600 mg PO x 1 with Heparin
gtt was started. Laboratory studies demonstrated WBC 10.1, HCT
35.2%, PLT 532. Potassium 4.5 and magnesium 3.1. Creatinine 2.5
(baseline creatinine 0.9-1.0). Troponin-T 4.14. INR 3.1 (on
Coumadin).
.
Of note, the patient was admitted to the MICU in [**7-/2153**] with
acute hypoxic respiratory failure thought to be acute on chronic
thromboembolic disease with resulting severe pulmonary
hypertension and right ventricular failure (severe RV
dilatation, moderate TR, hypokinetic and dilated right
ventricle). She was evaluated by the Cardiology service given
the finding of a PFO with right-to-left shunt; they recommended
against closure of PFO given need for permanent anticoagulation
for pulmonary emboli anyway. A repeat 2D-Echo in [**8-/2153**] showed
persistent PFO and similar pulmonary pressures (PASP 83 mmHg)
without RV dilatation. She was diuresed aggressively and started
on Sildenafil.
.
On arrival to the CCU, the patient is without significant
complaints.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,
ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or pre-syncope.
.
ROS: The patient denies a history of prior stroke/TIA, deep
venous thrombosis or pulmonary embolus. They deny bleeding at
the time of prior procedures or surgeries. Denies headaches or
vision changes. No cough or upper respiratory symptoms. Denies
chest pain, dizziness or lightheadedness; no palpitations.
Denies shortness of breath. No nausea or vomiting, denies
abdominal pain. No dysuria or hematuria. No change in bowel
movements or bloody stools. Denies muscle weakness, myalgias or
neurologic complaints. No exertional buttock or calf pain.

PAST MEDICAL & SURGICAL HISTORY:
1. Pulmonary emboli ([**7-/2153**] right upper lobe subsegmental PE -
likely acute; right lower lobe chronic embolism - right upper,
middle and lower perfusion defects on V/Q-scan in [**5-/2153**];
anticoagulated with Coumadin)
2. Patent foramen ovale (bubble study in [**7-/2153**] showed
right-to-left shunting during rest; evaluated by Cardiology with
permanent anticoagulation needs, thus closure was deferred -
repeat 2D-Echo showed persistent PFO)
3. Hypertension
4. Moderate dementia
5. Reflux esophagitis, GERD
6. Transient ischemic attacks (residual deficit of right tongue
deviation), [**2148**]
7. Hiatal hernia
8. Chronic neck pain, spasms (over 20-years)
9. Atypical chest pain episodes (negative prior cardiac stress
testing; [**7-/2148**] non-specific EKG changes and no anginal symptoms
with normal perfusion study, LVEF 72%)
10. Chronic microcytic anemia (upper endoscopy in [**2146**] with
hiatal hernia, otherwise normal study; prior negative
colonoscopy per report)
11. s/p bilateral total knee replacements
12. s/p cataract surgery ([**2144**])

Social History:
Patient lives at [**Hospital3 **] facility, to be with her
husband who requires more care; has two sons [**Name2 (NI) 1158**], HCP and
[**Name (NI) **]). She is a retired bookkeeper. Denies tobacco use or
alcohol use; no recreational substance use.

Family History:
Denies family history of early MI, arrhythmia, cardiomyopathies,
or sudden cardiac death; mother died in her 80s of colon cancer
(had CAD); father died at 84 years old of an MI.

EKG (in the [**Hospital1 18**] ED): AV-dissociation with an atrial rate of 85
bpm and ventricular rate of 45 bpm; ST-evelations in lead III
greater than II, avF, with reciprocal changes in I, aVL, with
TWI in V3-6.
.
2D-ECHO ([**2153-8-23**]): The left atrium is normal in size. The
interatrial septum is aneurysmal. A patent foramen ovale is
present. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are
normal. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF > 55%). The right
ventricular cavity is moderately dilated with moderate global
free wall hypokinesis. There is abnormal septal motion/position
consistent with right ventricular pressure/volume overload. The
diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are
normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but
aortic stenosis is not present. Trace aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Physiologic mitral regurgitation is seen (within normal limits).
There is sev
