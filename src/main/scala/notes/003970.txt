LABORATORY/RADIOLOGIC DATA: WBC 14.1, hemoglobin 14.8,
hematocrit 46.3, platelets 232,000.  PT 12.6, PTT 26.6, INR
1.1.  Sodium 140, potassium 4.4, chloride 100, bicarbonate
32, BUN 23, creatinine 1.0, glucose 97.  Calcium 9.3,
phosphorus 3.5, magnesium 1.7.  The urinalysis was negative.

Chest x-ray showed severe upper lobe bullous emphysema and a
large hiatal hernia.  No acute pulmonary disease.

X-ray of the left foot showed no focal destruction,
periosteal reaction, or radio-opaque foreign body.  No
subcutaneous emphysema.

EKG showed a normal sinus rhythm at a rate of 79 with
premature ventricular contractions and supraventricular
extrasystole.  Right bundle branch block complete since
previous tracing and new left anterior fascicular block.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the hospital on
[**2112-11-8**].  She was started on vancomycin, levofloxacin, and
Flagyl.  Cardiology was consulted for preoperative clearance.
They recommended a Persantine MIBI study preoperatively,
increasing the patient's Enalapril from 5 mg p.o. q.d. to
b.i.d., and also starting a statin after lipid profile.

The patient underwent a left lower extremity angiogram via a
right femoral approach on [**2112-11-9**] by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
Postoperatively, the patient had a right groin hematoma.
Pressure was held approximately 45 minutes in total and the
hematoma resolved.

On the following day, while the patient was out of bed to
chair, the patient started to bleed from the right groin
puncture site again.  This was resolved with holding
pressure.

The patient's Persantine MIBI study was normal with an
ejection fraction of 63%.  The Cardiology Service cleared her
for surgery.  The patient was reluctant to start a statin
without first consulting her local cardiologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 103712**]
and this was deferred.

On [**2112-11-15**], the patient underwent a left femoral to
popliteal bypass graft with nonreverse saphenous vein.
Postoperatively, she had a palpable left anterior tibial
pulse.  Immediately postoperatively, the patient had an
episode of hypotension which was treated with an IV fluid
bolus.  The patient developed some oozing from her left groin
incision.  Her hematocrit was 26 with a PTT of 150.  The
patient received several units of fresh frozen plasma, packed
red blood cells, and lactate Ringer's solution.

On postoperative day number one, [**2112-11-16**], the patient was
brought to the Operating Room again for evacuation of left
thigh hematoma.  Postoperatively, she was treated with fresh
frozen plasma and DDAVP (desmopressin), for oozing which was
successful.

On [**2112-11-17**], the Hematology Service was consulted regarding
the patient's apparent coagulopathy which had been
successfully treated with the fresh frozen plasma and DDAVP.
After reviewing the [**Hospital 228**] medical records, it appeared
that the patient had an episode of a right groin hematoma
following her cardiac catheterization in [**2111-10-30**].
After careful review, it appeared that the patient was
extremely sensitive to heparin.  After stopping all heparin,
the patient's coagulations returned to [**Location 213**].

On [**2112-11-17**], Cardiology was reconsulted because the patient
had developed extrasystoles which had also occurred
preoperatively.  Cardiology started the patient on Diltiazem
30 mg q.i.d. and recommended titration to keep the heart rate
less than 100.  They also noted that the patient was 9.5
liters up and 8 kilograms up from her preoperative weight.
they recommended gentle diuresis with Lasix and keeping her
hematocrit greater than 30.

The patient was again transfused for a hematocrit of 27.
Post transfusion hematocrit was 34.  The patient's Diltiazem
was titrated to keep the heart rate less than 80 and systolic
blood pressure greater than 100 with Diltiazem SR 120 mg p.o.
q.d.  The patient will follow-up with her local cardiologist,
Dr. .....................

At the time of dictation, the patient's left leg incision is
clean, dry, and intact.  She has a palpable graft.  The
cellulitis had improved.  She had been ambulating with
physical therapy who suggested a [**Hospital 3058**] rehabilitation
stay.

The patient will be discharged to [**Hospital 3058**] rehabilitation
on two more weeks of levofloxacin.  She will follow-up with
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in the office for surgical staple removal in
two weeks.
