Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1283**]
Chief Complaint:
acute mitral regurg

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2163-12-26**] MVR (onx 25mm/33mm)


History of Present Illness:
62yo man with hx of asthma and mitral regurg comes in from OSH
with acute mitral regurgitation.  Three months ago, he had
several weeks of a cough, treated with inhalers with
improvement.  Then two days ago, he experienced CP, PND, and
orthopnea.  This persisted.  Last night, he had severe orthopnea
and had increasing fatigue so his wife brought him to OSH around
5am on [**12-24**].
.
At OSH, initial EKG showed sinus tachy, nl axis, nl intervals.
Peaked T waves V3-V4.  CXR showed pulm edema.  Received lasix 20
IV in ED.  Then hypotensive so required NS bolus.  Developed
resp distress so started BiPAP and solumedrol 150 IV.  Received
another 20 IV lasix but BP dropped so received 1000 NS bolus.
To ICU: O2 sat remained low 80s% on 100% NRB.  Intubated at
12:15pm w AC 500/16 100% PEEP 5.  O2 sats remained 90-93%.
Sedated with propofol and fentanyl.  No pressors were started.
.
Echo per report showed MV prolapse with likely acute flail
leaflet ? chordae rupture.
.
Patient transferred here urgently and went directly to cath lab.
 Initial BP 80s/60.  Tachycardic to 120.  IABP placed and SBP
improved to the 90s, MAP at 65.  Coronaries were examined and
were clean.  Swan placed with wedge of 31 (with steep V waves),
RA 9, RV 64/19, PA 70/30 (51).  TEE showed posterior mitral
leaflet flail and severe MR.  Cardiac surgery consulted.  The
IABP site on right was bleeding so it was resited to left groin.
 MAPs dropped and cardiac index 1.55 so periph dopa started with
good response.
.
Also received lasix 40mg IV with approx 1L UOP in cath lab.
Creatinine increased from 1.4 to 1.8 then stabilized at 1.7.
ABGs here were 7.23/56/86 so RR increased.  Then 7.31/43/138
then 7.26/48/97 w lactate 1.4 so Vt increased and Peep
increased.

the procedure. The TEE probe was passed with assistance from the
anesthesioology staff using a laryngoscope. No TEE related
complications.

Conclusions
This was a focused study on patient in shock, with IABP, for
urgent MVR.
Pre-Bypass: No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the left
atrial appendage. There is moderate global right ventricular
free wall hypokinesis. The ascending, transverse and descending
thoracic aorta are normal in diameter and free of
atherosclerotic plaque. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are moderately thickened. Severe (4+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial effusion.

Post Bypass: Patient is on Milrinone. Well-seated and
functioning mitral prosthesis. No leak, no MR. [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **]. Aorta
intact. RV systolic fxn is good. LV is globally mildly
depressed.


Brief Hospital Course:
He was taken to the operating room on [**2163-12-26**] where he
underwent an MVR. He was transferred to the ICU in critical but
stable condition on milrinone, neo and propofol. He
inadvertently pulled out his own balloon pump but remained
stable. He was extubate on POD #1. He was given 48 hours of
perop vancomycin because he was in the hospital preoperatively.
He was transfused for HCT 22. He was started on coumadin for his
mechanical valve. He was pancultured for elevated wbc and
started on Zosyn for presumed aspiration pneumonia.  He
initially failed swallow evaluation and was seen by ENT for
question of pharyhgeal pouch seen on video swallow.  He was
transferred to the floor on POD #5. He passed repeat swallow
evaluation. He remained on heparin gtt awaiting a therapeutic
INR, and was ready for discharge home on POD # 10. He completed
a one week course of zosyn. His wife spoke with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
office who has agreed to follow his coumadin, doses and
discharge info were faxed there.
