Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2736**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac catheterization with drug eluting stent placement to the
third obtuse marginal coronary branch (OM3).


History of Present Illness:
The patient is an 83-year-old African American male with a known
history of hypertension, dyslipidemia and coronary artery
disease who is status-post BMS placement to OM3 in [**2095**]. He
presented to the emergency room after two episodes of substernal
chest pain. The first episode occured 1 day prior to admission.
At that time the patient states that he was sitting, preparing a
lesson plan, when he felt a sudden onset of [**8-25**] "sharp" chest
pain which radiated to his left shoulder and also involved his
left arm. The pain was "stabbing" and had no association with
dyspnea, nausea, vomiting, or diaphoresis. The patient taught a
class through the pain and his sub-sternal chest pain resolved
without medication. The following afternoon, the patient had an
almost identical episode of pain beginning at 1pm, although it
did not involve the left arm and it started while he was walking
and doing errands. He drove home and called for an ambulance
within one hour of the onset of his chest pain. As with his
episode from the prior afternoon, there was no nausea, shortness
of breath, vomiting, diaphoresis, lightheadedness or
palpitations associated with this second bout of chest pain.
.
Mr. [**Known lastname **] states that at his baseline his exercise tolerance is
limited only by his knee pain and longstanding osteoarthritis
"aches". He has never had any chest pain or shortness of breath
associated with exertion.
.
Upon arrival to [**Hospital1 18**] in the ED the patient reported [**3-25**] chest
pain and his EKG was notable for ST depressions in V1-V3.
Posterior EKG was done which showed ST elevations in posterior
V3-V6. STEMI protocol was initiated and MR. [**Known lastname **] was given a load
of 600mg Plavix, IV Heparin bolus, and started on Nitroglycerin
drip. 325mg ASA had already been given prior to arrival to the
hospital. The ST elevations resolved on repeat EKG with these
treatments and the patient's chest pain decreased to [**12-24**] and
was stable at that level leading up to his presentation to the
CCU.
.
Of note, the patient had an episode of chest pain in [**2095**] which
led to emergent cardiac catheterization with BMS placement to
OM3. He explains his chest pain in [**2095**] as being more severe and
intense. Unfortunately, subsequent to his MI in [**2095**] he endured
a frontal intraparenchymal hemorrhage immediately after the
hospitalization for this procedure which was attributed to a
combination of poorly controlled hypertension and several
anticoagulants, including ticlid, aspirin, and heparin. After
this CVA he had word finding difficulty, motor impairments, and
memory deficits but he states that all of these troubling
complications resolved over time and he has no lasting cognitive
impairments or focal motor/sensory neurologic handicaps at this
time.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of dyspnea on
exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, palpitations,
syncope or presyncope. He does have ankle edema which worsens
throughout the day and improves with leg elevation as well as
chronic intermittent knee aches secondary to a history of
osteoarthritis.

Past Medical History:
1. CARDIAC RISK FACTORS: + Dyslipidemia, + Hypertension,
+Age/Sex
2. CARDIAC HISTORY:
-PERCUTANEOUS CORONARY INTERVENTIONS:
[**2095**]: 90% stenosis in OM3 into which a BMS was placed
3. OTHER PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
-Hyperlipidemia
-Glucose intolerance
-HTN
-Osteoarthritis
-Right inguinal hernia, status post repair in [**2068**]
-CVA: frontal intraparenchymal hemorrhage post-cath while on
Ticlid and aspirin
-Prostate cancer s/p local radiation
.

Social History:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is married and lives with his wife in [**Location (un) 686**], MA. He
is a former
[**Hospital1 **] employee as a maintenance supervisor. He denies smoking
cigarettes. He reports  drinking approximately [**12-16**] glasses of
wine per week and he denies using any other illicit drugs.


Family History:
No family history of early MI, otherwise his family history is
remarkable for  diabetes mellitus type II in multiple family
members.
