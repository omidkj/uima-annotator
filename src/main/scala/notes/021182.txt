Past Medical History:
- RIGHT MEDIAL THIGH WOUND: Developed after developing severe
cellulitis in late [**2153**] and underwent a biopsy of the area
[**2153-11-22**]. Did not heal due to DM and chemo. Sunitinib put on
hold to allow further healing, but has since restarted low dose.
Measurement of wound was 8 x 0.5cm. The first 4 cm on the right
was still open with hypergranulation tissue present on [**2153-12-25**].

- GIST: Diagnosed in [**2143**], treated with surgery and multiple
intermittant courses of gleevac, complicated by side effects.
She had partial gastrectomy and GIST resection in [**2143**], and a
GIST omental metastasis resection in 03/[**2153**]. Noted to have GIB
in [**Month (only) 205**] and [**2153-8-13**] due to enlarging GIST lesions. Started
on Sutent since [**2153-10-1**]. Currently on low dose Sutent
following poor wound healing as above.
- ANEMIA, iron deficiency
- Paroxysmal ATRIAL FIBRILLATION, not on AC due to multiple RP
bleeds
- CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE, Diastolic, ef >70%.
- DIABETES MELLITUS
- Chronic DYSPNEA, exertional
- HYPERTENSION
- HYPOTHYROIDISM
- CVA in [**2136**], Residual R hemiparesis and intermittent aphasia,
- TIA in [**2148**]
- Status post knee surgery in [**2137**].

[**2154-10-7**] CXR (PA/lat)
IMPRESSION: Increased opacity at the right lung base, likely a
combination of effusion and atelectasis, though underlying
pneumonia difficult to exclude.
.
[**2154-10-8**] CXR (portable)
IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to [**10-7**]:
There is greater consolidation at the right lung base today,
which could be atelectasis worsening in the setting of
persistent moderate right pleural effusion or worsening
pneumonia.  Improvement in perihilar opacification in the left
mid lung may be a function of difference in radiographic
technique.
The area is not clear, whether it is edema or a second focus of
pneumonia, is radiographically indeterminate.  Moderate
enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is longstanding.
.
[**2154-10-10**] CT Abd/Pelvis (with contrast)
IMPRESSION:
1.  Large-volume hemoperitoneum concerning for bleeding from
diffuse
peritoneal metastases, though there is no active extravasation.

.
2.  Increased right pleural effusion with possibly hemorrhagic
contents,
raising the question of thoracoabdominal communication through a
diaphragmatic rent.
.
3.  Volume overload.
.
[**2154-10-15**] CT Abd/Pelvis (non-contrast)
IMPRESSION:
1.  Mild interval increase in the complex abdominal fluid,
likely
hemoperitoneum, compared to [**2154-10-10**].  Multiple stable
peritoneal and
mesenteric metastasis.
.
2.  Mild interval increase in the hemorrhagic moderate-to-large
right pleural effusion.
.
[**2154-10-15**] CT Abd/Pelvis (non-contrast)
IMPRESSION:
1.  Stable intra-abdominal and pelvic hemoperitoneum, overall
unchanged since CT from 9 hours prior.
2.  Foci of hyperdensity within the anterior aspect of the left
side of the hemoperitoneum may represent residual contrast
within bowel.  Overall, no significant change in attenuation of
the hemoperitoneum to suggest accumulating acute blood product.
3.  Stable moderate right basilar high density pleural effusion
and basilar atelectasis.
4.  Completely decompressed urinary bladder with Foley catheter
in place and no residual urine noted within the bladder.  Large
amount of pelvic
hemoperitoneum overlies the urinary bladder superiorly.  No
evidence of
hydronephrosis. On review of the prior CT, no distended bladder
is identified
- it is possible that the post void residual seen was due to
above loculated hemoperitoneum given the extent of fluid as
described.
.
[**2154-10-17**] CT Chest (non-contrast)
IMPRESSION:
1.  Complete drainage of right pleural fluid collection after
placement of right basal pleural catheter. Bibasilar opacities
are more likely atelectasis than aspiration. Status of the
effusion can be monitored with serial radiographs if clinically
relevant.
.
2.  Intervally enlarged epicardial lymph node with possibly
enlarging right hilar lymph nodes are not fully assessed on this
non-contrast study. These findings should be reassessed in [**3-19**]
weeks (or per continuing surveillance plans for intraabdominal
malignancy) with a contrast CT study.
.
3. Complex ascites and other findings of known intra-abdominal
malignancy are incompletely assessed on this study.
.
.
[**2154-10-20**] CT AP

IMPRESSION:
1.  Mild interval increase in high density ascites along the
left paracolic
gutter, representing mild progression of hemoperitoneum compared
to [**2154-10-15**].
2.  Interval drainage of right pleural effusion with pleural
catheter in place
and hydropneumothorax.
3.  Redemonstration of the diffuse omental and peritoneal
metastases.
4.  No evidence of renal vein compression in particular (as
queried) given the
limitations of this non-contrast study.
.




Brief Hospital Course:
79 yo w/GIST, diastolic CHF, Afib presents with dyspnea on
exertion and chest pain, found to have dropping Hgb likely
source was hemoperitoneum and hemothorax
.
# Symptomatic Acute Blood Loss Anemia: [**2-14**] GIST tumor bleeding
pt received a total of 3 units pRBC with improvement in her
symptoms. CT abd/pelvis to look for recurrent RP bleed, was
delayed due to [**Last Name (un) **] as the study required contrast. On hosptial
day 3 pt had CT scan which showed hemoperitoneum without any
active bleeding.  She initially remained stable, however, her
Hct after a period of stability, began to downtrend again,
suggesting recurrent bleed.  She received 2 additional units of
PRBC's, with appropriate response.  Repeat non-contrast CT's
showed relatively stable hemoperitoneum, but did suggest
expanding pleural effusion, suggesting potential blood loss into
the thorax.  She underwent chest tube placement by IP at the
bedside (see below).  She was also seen by Surgery Consult for
possible surgical intervention, however, given the metastatic
disease, she is a poor surgical candidate.  Furthermore, pt and
her family did not want to pursue surgery as an option.  Her
case was discussed with IR and they could not see a localized
source of bleeding on the CT scans and suggested a tagged RBC
scan to further eval for bleeding.  However, b/c of [**Last Name (un) **], e
