PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient initially was febrile
99.4. Pulse 98 to 120.  His blood pressure initially was
70/30 that was on neo-synephrine.  Initially when he was seen
he was intubated and sedated.  He was on AC, tidal volume
500, rate of 14.  He was cachectic elderly male in obvious
respiratory distress.  His lungs he had diffuse wheezing and
rales on the right side.  Cardiac examination was
tachycardic, but no murmurs.  Abdomen was benign.  He did
have 1+ pedal edema throughout.  Neurologically he was
sedated.

LABORATORY:  Initial white blood cell count was 15.3 with 47%
polys, 37% bands, H&H 10/30.7, platelet count 315.  His
initial urinalysis was negative.  His SMA 7 his sodium was
143, potassium 4.6, chloride 115, BUN 30, creatinine 1.2,
glucose 118, bicarb 25.  His initial set of cardiac enzymes
were negative.  Initial albumin 2.2.  Initial blood gas was
7.22, PCO2 70, PO2 of 33.  Initial electrocardiogram he was
in atrial fibrillation at a rate of 136 with [**Street Address(2) 1766**]
depressions in V4 to V6, which were old.  Initial chest x-ray
revealed a right lower lobe pneumonia in addition to a
possible right middle lobe infiltrate with chronic
emphysematous changes.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  1.  Pneumonia/sepsis:  The patient admitted
initially with a right lower lobe pneumonia and was febrile
and hypotensive initially admitted to the [**Hospital Ward Name 332**] Intensive
Care Unit.  He was treated with Ceftriaxone and Azithromycin
initially.  He was on neo-synephrine.  The patient continued
to remain poorly over the first two to three days of his
course.  Chest x-ray revealed multifocal pneumonia with
increased opacities in the right middle lobe and left lower
lobe after hydration.  Initial gram sputum culture grew out
gram negative rods.  The antibiotics were switched to Zosyn
to cover for Pseudomonas.  The patient was started on Xigris
(activated protein C) in addition to his antibiotics and pressors
for treatment of sepsis for a four day course.  The patient
eventually was able to have after aggressive fluid hydration his
neo-synephrine weaned off and the gram negative rods in his
sputum eventually grew out E-coli and proteus.  The patient's
antibiotics were switched from Zosyn to Levaquin and Flagyl.
On [**5-21**] the patient was eventually extubated and has been
able to maintain his SaO2 90 to 92% on 3 to 5 liters requiring
Albuterol and Atrovent nebulizers.  The patient was restarted on
his Albuterol and Atrovent MDI in addition to his Flovent MDI.
The patient will complete a fourteen day course of Levo and
Flagyl.  He is discharged on day twelve to be completed on [**5-26**].  In addition, he will continue his Albuterol nebulizers and
Atrovent nebulizers prn and his standing MDIs with good pulmonary
toilet.  Blood pressure has been stable off pressors now for
several days.

2.  MAT/wondering atrial pacemaker:  The patient was
initially tachycardic initially in atrial fibrillation and
then switched to MAT.  However, with proper resuscitation and
restarting his Diltiazem the patient's rate became under
control.  His cardiac enzymes were negative throughout.

3.  Deep venous thrombosis:  The patient initially had a
right IJ placed on admission and was aggressively volume
repleted, however, after diuresis his upper extremities
remained swollen.  The patient underwent an ultrasound of his
upper extremities bilaterally, which revealed a left axillary
vein clot, which was nonoccluding, however, the patient was
started on anticoagulation with heparin and then transitioned
to Coumadin.  The patient will need to continue transition
with three days of subcutaneous Lovenox and continue Coumadin
until his INR is therapeutic at which time the Lovenox to be
discontinued.  Total course to be dictated by his primary
care physician.

4.  Renal:  The patient initially admitted with an acute
metabolic acidosis thought secondary to sepsis.  The patient
was also hypotensive.  Renal function did worsen slightly and
urine output did diminish, however, again with pressor
support and aggressive hydration renal function was able to
return back to normal with good urine output and the patient
was diuresed back to baseline weight upon discharge.

5.  Neurological:  The patient initially sedated while he was
intubated, however, upon extubation the patient was in severe
pain due to his chronic compression fractures.  As the
Fentanyl drip was discontinued after extubation, the patient
was restarted on a Fentanyl patch with prn Percocets and
remains in good pain control, however, the patient does have
periodic episodes of delirium where he gets quite upset
requiring reassurance from both family members and
physicians, however, the patient was alert and oriented times
three at the time of discharge.

6.  Anemia:  Patient with a history of anemia.  He did have
some trace coffee grounds that cleared quickly.  The patient
was OB negative throughout his stay, however, as far as stool
is concerned and the patient received 1 to 2 units of blood
while on Xigris, however, required no further blood
transfusions throughout his stay.

7.  Thrush:  The patient developed some thrush while on
antibiotics, however, received some Nystatin swish and
swallow, which seemed to improve it quite nicely.

8.  Volume status:  The patient was aggressively volume
repleted while he was septic and was 15 liters positive at
one time, however, the patient was aggressively diuresed both
peri and post extubation with good urine output and the
patient is near his dry weight.  The
