Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 905**]
Chief Complaint:
Fever, hypoxia, mental status changes

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Central line
Heel debridement


History of Present Illness:
The patient is an 80 year old male s/p subarachnoid hemorrhage 3
years ago with L ICA aneurysm s/p coiling, h/o hydrocephalus s/p
VP shunt revision in [**2119-1-26**] by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], DMII and dementia
who presented to the ED on [**2119-6-11**] as a transfer from [**Hospital 4199**]
Hospital who received the patient from his nursing home after
being found with hypoxia sat'ing in the 70s-80s with tachypnea
and hypotension BP 80/p with unresponsiveness with a fever of
105.5.
.
The patient had been evaluated in the [**Hospital1 18**] ER on [**2119-6-10**] for
mental status changes and was seen by neurosurgery who felt that
his symptoms were secondary to a UTI. He had a CT and plain film
of his head that showed no discontinuity of the LP shunt with no
acute intracranial hemorrhage and slight increase in size of the
3rd and 4th ventricles. He was discharged to his nursing home
with cipro for a UTI.
.
At [**Last Name (un) 4199**], the patient was found to be febrile to 105.5, P 134,
RR 46, BP 109/88, 92% on a 100% NRB. ABG 7.44/36/98. Labs
remarkable for K 5.0, BS 276, Cr 1.4. WBC 12, Hct 41. Troponin I
0.06, CKMB 0.8.
.
The patient was given clindamycin and avelox 400 mg IV for ?
pneumonia/UTI and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]. His temp on arrival was
100.4, HR 105, bp 116/46, RR 28, 94% - 100% on NRB. He received
a total of 6 liters IVF in the ED after his BP dropped from 116
to 74/48. A left femoral line was placed and the patient was
placed on dopamine 10 mcg. Lactate 3.5. He was given ceftriaxone
2 gm IV and vancomycin 1 gm for presumed ?meningitis.
.
Neurosurgery evaluated the patient in the ED and felt that his
symptoms were not neurologic or secondary to meningitis. LP was
not felt to be necessary.
.
Repeat CT head performed with results still pending. CXR
initially showed NAD but on repeat showed ?RLL infiltrate.
Repeat UA mildly positive with 6-10 WBC, 0 epithelial cells.
.
The patient was maintained on a 100% NRB and a femoral line was
placed with multiple unsuccessful attempts at central access
through IJ/subclavian. Transferred to MICU for sepsis management
on dopamine 10 mcg.
.
ROS:
.
Unable to obtain given mental status.

IMAGING:
CT head:
FINDINGS: Since previous examination, there is minimal to
slightly increased size of the third ventricle. The lateral
ventricles are generally unchanged. There is no evidence of
acute hemorrhage or shift of normally midline structures. The
appearance of regions of old infarct and periventricular white
matter hypoattenuation are unchanged. The patient is again noted
to be status post aneurysmal coiling in the left supraclinoid
region.

IMPRESSION: No evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage. There
is unchanged to slight increase in size of the third ventricle
without change within the lateral ventricles. The
ventriculostomy catheter is unchanged in position. There is also
the appearance of mild increase in dilatation of the fourth
ventricle.

CTA chest:
CT OF THE CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST: The central airways are patent
to the segmental levels, bilaterally. An NG tube is noted, its
tip is excluded. The pulmonary artery is patent without filling
defects to suggest pulmonary embolism. Again noted, extensive
atherosclerotic changes involving the aorta. Unchanged anterior
mediastinal mass. There is a conglomeration of lymph nodes in
the mediastinum, which are borderline enlarged and unchanged
when compared to the prior study dated [**2116-6-16**]. Since
prior exam, the pleural effusions have resolved. Coronary artery
calcifications are noted. The heart is normal in size. The
patient is status post mitral valve replacement.
Bilateral dependent airspace consolidation likely represents
aspiration pneumonia, less likely atelectasis. There are
scattered hazy nodules within the right middle lobe and right
upper and right lower lobe, the largest one measuring 7 mm in
the right lower lobe.

IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of PE.

2. Bilateral dependent airspace consolidation likely represents
aspiration pneumonia, less likely atelectasis.

3. Unchanged right anterior mediastinal mass likely residual
thyroid.

4. Borderline enlarged lymph nodes in the mediastinum, and
unchanged when compared to prior study.

5. Coronary artery disease.

6. Scattered hazy nodules within the right lung, the largest one
measuring 7 mm in the right lower lobe. Followup in six months
is recommended.

CXR:
[**2119-6-13**]
CHEST, AP UPRIGHT: Comparison is made to two days earlier. The
patient is status post sternotomy and mitral valve replacement.
Cardiac and mediastinal contours are unchanged. There is a dense
left lower lobe consolidation, as well as patchy but extensive
consolidations in the mid right lung and both lower lung fields,
markedly progressed since the prior study. There is no definite
effusion or pneumothorax.

IMPRESSION: Considerable progression of bilateral pulmonary
opacities, most consistent with multifocal pneumonia or
aspiration.
