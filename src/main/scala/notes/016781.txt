Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 943**]
Chief Complaint:
Dark stool

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Endotracheal intubation
EGD with three variceal glue injections
Right heart catheterization


History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 61-year-old man with a history of cirrhosis
likely secondary to NASH with complications that include
esophageal varices with previous admissions for bleeding. The
patient's wife reports that over the past two weeks the patient
has been increasingly tired and has been sleeping much more
often than usual. His PCP discovered an increased proBNP and has
been trying to increase his diuresis. The patient also recently
had a trial of Pradaxa because his INRs on warfarin have been
unpredictable. Unfortunately, the patient experienced
significant sensations of heartburn while on Pradaxa. The
patient reported to the hospital today, however after two
episodes of melena, one in the morning and one in the afternoon.
The patient denied any emesis or hemetemesis at home. He did
have some mild abdominal pain.

In the ED, initial VS were 19:48 1 98.1 85 126/59 16 98%. Rectal
exam showed melanotic stool that was guaiac positive. The
patient had two 18 gauge peripheral IVs placed and was intended
to go to the [**Doctor Last Name 3271**]-[**Doctor Last Name 679**] service. The Liver service wanted to
perform endoscopy and as decision about intubation was to be
made, the patient vomited 1L of bright red blood. The patient
was then intubated with succinylcholine and etomidate. Mr. [**Known lastname 12056**]
also received Zofran, pantoprazole,a nd octreotide. The
Emergency Department was planning on adding a third periperal
IV. The patient would be transfused at least two units of pRBCs
and may receive four. Liver intends endoscopy with possible
banding/cauterization. Mr. [**Known lastname 12056**] also received 1g ceftriaxone in
the ED.
.
On arrival to the MICU, the patient had received two units of
FFP and one unit of pRBCs. He is intubated and sedated. The
Liver team arrived to perform endoscopy. Liver performed
endoscopy, noted three bleeding varices in the fundus of the
stomach, which were glued.

OTHER HEMODYNAMIC DATA:      The oxygen consumption was assumed.
PVR: 4.2 [**Doctor Last Name **] unit.
COMMENTS:
1. Resting hemodynamics revealed elevated right and left sided
filling
pressures with RVEDP 22 mmHg and PCW 26 mmHg. There was severe
pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension with PASP of 84 mmHg. The cardiac
index was
2.4 L/min/m2 (using an assumed oxygen consumption).
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Elevated biventricular filling pressures.
2. Severe pulmonary hypertension.

EGD:
3 cords of grade I varices were seen in the lower third of the
esophagus. The varices were not bleeding.
3 fundic varices noted in the stomach. One big one actively
bleeding and other two small ones with stigmata of recent bleed.
Varices polymerised and shrunk in size after injecting 2 cc glue
in one big varix and 1 cc each in 2 small varices.
Blood in the whole stomach
Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum


Brief Hospital Course:
 61-year-old man with a history of cirrhosis secondary to NASH
with complication of esophageal varices, diabetes, atrial
fibrillation, AVR, hypertension, diastolic CHF who presents with
GI bleed and episode of hemetemesis in the ED, found to have
volume overload on cath and difficult to control
anticoagulation.

#. Upper GI bleed, secondary to esophageal varices: Patient has
previous admission in [**2172-5-31**] for esophageal bleeding. Liver
performed endoscopy and found three actively bleeding varices in
the fundus of the stomach, which where glued and appeared to
have stopped bleeding. Endoscopy demonstrated varices at the
lower third of the esophagus with old blood in the stomach.
patient was kept on a PPI drip as well as an octreotide drip and
transitioned to PO PPI and off octreotide. We actively followed
the patient's hematocrit after the pRBC transfusions. Patient's
hct was stable. total of 3uPRBC were transfused. Received 5 days
zosyn antibiotics. He was discharged on sucralfate and PPI [**Hospital1 **].
