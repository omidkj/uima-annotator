Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1167**]
Chief Complaint:
acute onset chest tightening, dizziness, diaphoresis, and
shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
coronary catherterization

History of Present Illness:
81 y old male with hx of dyslipidemia, HTN, CAD s/p NQWMI in '[**32**]
s/p bare metal stenting of proximal and mid LAD as well as OM1
presented to ED by ambulance with acute onset chest tightening,
dizziness, diaphoresis, and shortness of breath, was found to
have STE >5mm in II, III, aVF, V4-V6 along with 3-4mm ST
depression in I and aVL.  Hr was in the 40s.  Code STEMI was
called, pt was given ASA 325mg, plavix 600mg (although takes
plavix at home), Heparin 5000 units x 1, Integrillin 17mg IVx1
and then transferred to cath lab.  In cath lab pt had
successfull bare metal stenting to proximal RCA and was also
found to have new diffuse aneurysmla dilatation of his vessels.
Pt became bardycardic intermittently in the cath lab and
required atropine x2.  Temporary pacer placed prior to the
transfer to the floor.
When pt seen on on the floor he denied any chets pain, sob,
diaphoresis, nausea.  States onset of chest pain was in the
setting of the culmination of a 16 day editing project he had as
a composer.  Pt quickly realized the urgency of the situation as
the sx's very similar to his prior MI and therefore asked his
friend to [**Name2 (NI) **] 911.
Of note, pt states he was on ASA 325mg up until about 2 years
ago when he was noted to have "blood from below".  Per pt he was
told to stop taking the ASA and never had a GI w/u for the
bleeding as he states "it was assumed that the bleeding was due
to apirin".  His last colonoscopy was 7-8 years ago and was
normal.  he has never had an EGD.
At home pt exercises by "speed-walking" on a treadmill for 30
minutes almost every day and never experiences any anginal sx's
or SOB.  He has never smoked, drinks occasionally and tries to
adhere to a fairly low fat diet.
.
On review of symptoms, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis,
recent black stools or red stools. He denies recent fevers,
chills or rigors. He denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All
of the other review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems when seen on the floor is notable for
absence of chest pain, dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal
dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or
presyncope.

Echo ([**9-19**]):
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The estimated right atrial
pressure is 0-5mmHg. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is mild regional left
ventricular systolic dysfunction with focal hypokinesis of the
inferolateral wall. The remaining segments contract normally
(LVEF = 45-50 %). The aortic root is moderately dilated at the
sinus level. The ascending aorta is moderately dilated. The
aortic arch is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. There is no
mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with regional systolic dysfunction c/w
CAD. Mild aortic regurgitation. Mild mitral regurgitation.
Dilated thoracic aorta.

Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable
for review) of [**2130-12-21**], the regional left ventricular wall
motion abnormality is new and the ascending aorta and arch are
now identified as dilated.

CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS:
Based on [**2137**] AHA endocarditis prophylaxis recommendations, the
echo findings indicate prophylaxis is NOT recommended. Clinical
decisions regarding the need for prophylaxis should be based on
clinical and echocardiographic data.

Brief Hospital Course:
Pt with presentation to [**Hospital1 18**] as mentioned above, taken to cath;
in cath lab pt had successfull bare metal stenting to proximal
RCA and was also found to have new diffuse aneurysmal dilatation
of his vessels.  Pt became bardycardic intermittently in the
cath lab and required atropine x2.  Temporary pacer placed prior
to the transfer to the CCU. In the CCU where pt was placed on
tele.  On the second day the pace was briefly needed but then
heart rate remained in to 60-s and 70s, therefore the pacer was
removed after 48hrs, lopressor was again started after 72 hrs
without a drop in the heart rate (bradycardia improved as
expected since RCA reperfused)
Enzymes were negative in the emergency room, but second set came
back VERY elevated at CK 2713, Trop T 11.23, CK-MB 363 and MB
index of 13.4. Ezymes thereafter trended down.  Medically,
plavix 75 mg was continued, atorvastatin 80mg was started (for
pleotropic effects, i.e. anti-inflammatory ect, and for
mortality benefits), ASA 325 mg was restarted in hosp on
admission.  The reason for pt not taking it the past 2 years
prior to presentation was cleared up with PCP who stated this
was b/c pt had nose bleeds during his performances, and
therefore elected not to take ASA anymore.  PCP agrees pt needs
to be on lifelong ASA and plavix and will follow up closely in
the case of another bleed.  ACEI was held on presentation due to
concern of droing BP with bradycardia but restarted on HOD#2. An
echo was done to r/o wall motion abnormalities determine EF
demonstrating mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
regional systolic dysfunction, and LVEF = 45-50 % c/w CAD.
Pt was evaluated by PT who found patient fit to go home since pt
ambulated for 15 minutes at a fast rate without any CP or SOB.
Upon discharge pt was asymptomatic, and ambulating, voiding,
taking good po on own, and saturating well off oxygen.
