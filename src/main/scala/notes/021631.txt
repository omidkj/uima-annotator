Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 618**]
Chief Complaint:
right sided weakness, difficulty with speech


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Nasogastric tube placement

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Name13 (STitle) 17469**] is a 61 year old male with untreated hypertension
found on the ground this morning with right sided weakness found
to have a left globus pallidus hemorrhage. He was found by his
brother this morning, noted the above deficits, and was taken to
[**Hospital3 **]. Head CT at [**Hospital1 **] revealed left 2x4cm putaminal
hemorrhage. He was given Mannitol 25g IV x 1, Nitroglycerin IV
for elevated BP and transferred via [**Location (un) **] to [**Hospital1 18**].

Further history is difficult to obtain as the pt is
unaccompanied and has a nonfluent aphasia. The patient denies
any headache at present. He reports drinking vodka daily.
Outside hospital records indicate the patient has not had any
medical care for many years. Further ROS unavailable.

Gen- slightly agitated moving about hospital bed with C-collar
on, opens eyes to voice, attempts to cooperate with examiner,
NAD
HEENT- NCAT, MMM, OP clear, anicteric sclera.
Neck- no carotid bruits bilaterally.
CV- RRR, no MRG
Pulm- CTA B
Abd- soft, nt, nd, BS+
Extrem- no CCE

Neurologic Exam:
MS- He reports being at "[**Hospital1 **]" (prior hospital) I am unable to
understand the pt's speech with regards to other ?'s of
orientation. His speech is severely dysarthric and largely
unintelligeble, however certain words seem appropriate and
understandable as above. He follows all midline and appendicular
commands with some impersistence.

CN- PERRL 4-->2mm bilaterally, fundi flat discs without
hemorrhages, EOM's are full with right conjugate gaze
preference,
blinks to threat bilaterally, right upper motor neuron facial
droop, right facial weakness, hearing intact to finger rub.
palate appears sluggish on the right.

Motor- slight postural tremor on left arm, no left drift or
asterixis. Right arm is plegic, extends and internally rotates
to
noxious stimuli. He can hold his right leg antigravity for 10
seconds. His left side appears to be full strength, but formal
strength testing is difficult to perform.

Sensation- intact to noxious throughout.

Reflexes- 2+ symmetric in delt, [**Hospital1 **], tri, brachiorad, patellars,
ankles bilaterally.

Coordination- mildly ataxic on FNF on left, +impersistent.

Plantar response is flexor on the left, extensor on the right.

Gait- unable to assess.

EKG- NSR 77, old IMI, IVCD, 1mm ST elevation in V5, V6

IMAGING:
CT HEAD [**6-9**]: There is a 4.8 x 1.9 cm region of hyperdensity with
surrounding hypodensity in the region of the left lentiform
nucleus and external capsule is consistent with acute
intraparenchymal hemorrhage with a mild amount of surrounding
vasogenic edema. This causes mild compression of the left
lateral ventricle and 3 mm rightward shift of normally midline
structures.

Otherwise, there are no other foci of hemorrhage, edema, mass,
or large vascular territory infarction. The basal cisterns are
preserved. Prominence of the extra-axial CSF spaces may be due
to age-related involutional change. No fractures are seen. There
is mild mucosal thickening in the left maxillary sinus.

IMPRESSION: Hemorrhage involving the left lentiform nucleus and
external capsule with mild surrounding vasogenic edema unchanged
from images from outside hospital. Mild shift of normally
midline structures towards the right.
<br>

CXR [**6-9**]: One supine portable view of the lower chest and upper
abdomen. Comparison with the previous studies of [**2136-6-9**]. A
Dobbhoff feeding tube has been inserted and terminates in the
right upper quadrant of the abdomen in the region of the gastric
antrum or duodenal bulb. There is persistent streaky density at
the right lung base consistent with subsegmental atelectasis.

IMPRESSION: Tube placement as described.

<br>
CXR [**6-13**]: Atelectasis at the right lung base persists. Lungs are
otherwise clear. Normal cardiomediastinal and hilar silhouettes.
Small bilateral pleural effusion is unchanged. Nasogastric tube
is looped in the distal stomach and ends in the proximal.


Brief Hospital Course:
BRIEF ICU COURSE:
Admitted initially to the Neuro ICU for close monitoring and
blood pressure control. Neurologic exam was significant for
non-fluent aphasia, right facial droop, right arm and leg
hemiplegia with extensor posturing of arm and triple flexion of
leg to noxious stimulation. The repeat head CT obtained here
revealed stable appearance of the hemorrhage relative to that
obtained at the OSH. The likely
etiology of the hemorrhage given the location is hypertension.
However, MRI/MRA as an outpatient in 1 month (once heme
components are resorbed) should be considered to rule out an
underlying mass lesion.

His blood pressure was controlled initially with a nicardipine
drip. After a few days, his pressure dropped into the 80s to
120s systolic; he was given fluid boluses to maintain a SBP >
100. He was covered with an insulin sliding scale and Tylenol
for fevers. His mental status and language gradually improved
over four days and he was transferred to the Stepdown Unit.

He did show signs of alcohol withdrawal and was treated with prn
Ativan. His Ativan requirement peaked at day 2 and declined
after that. His autonomic instability was treated with
clonidine. He was given daily IV Thiamine, Folate, and MVI.

He was ruled out for MI via serial cardiac enzymes.

Nutrition was initially provided via a nasogastric tube, as he
was unable to handle his own secretions. This improved as well
over the next several days, and once he required less suctioning
of his secretions he was transferred to the Stepdown Unit and
re-evaluated by the Speech and Swallow Consult.

He was febrile early in his admission, and grew staph aureus
from his sputum. He was treated with 4 days of vancomycin, but
switched to cefazolin once sensitivities were resulted. He also
was found to have a UTI by urinalysis and was treated with 3
days of ciprofloxacin.

PT and OT were provided.

BRIEF FLOOR COURSE:
No further complications arose on the floor. He pulled out his
NG tube on Sunday [**7-18**], but it didn;t need to be replaced
since the next AM he past his speech and swallow evaluation. His
bloodpressure medications were further titrated upwards, but
they may need further adjustment. Towards the end of his
hospital stay, the evening prior to discharge, he was a given
Ativan x 1 for restlessness and climbing out of bed putting him
at risk for falls. The next AM ([**2136-6-19**]) he was his usual self
and there were no overt signs of delerium. He was discharged to
rehab in stable condition.
