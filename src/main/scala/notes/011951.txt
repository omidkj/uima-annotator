History of Present Illness:
47 yo F s/p take down of prior Nissen fundoplication, [**Doctor Last Name **]
myotomy, and partial fundoplication on [**5-8**], returning today in
transfer from an OSH with complaints of abdominal pain and
dyspnea. She was discharged to home on [**5-10**] after an
unremarkable
hospital course. She was transferred from an OSH after she was
seen there with the complaints listed above. A CT scan was
performed there, which noted a possible PNA, no PE, as well as
free air and fluid in the upper abdomen that was concerning for
a
leak versus normal postoperative changes. She denies any fevers,
but does feel chilled. She has baseline dyspnea, but this is a
bit worse today. Her pain has been poorly controlled with oral
elixir oxycodone. Her pain is mostly centered in her epigastrum.
She denies significant dysphagia at this time. She is passing
flatus. She does feel a bit bloated.

CTA Torso (OSH): Reviewed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and radiology
resident,
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]. No official read placed. Bibasilar pulmonary
consolidation, atelectasis versus PNA. R>L pleural effusions.
Free air and fluid collection around L lobe of the liver, which
likely represents normal postoperative changes. No PE.

[**5-13**] CXR: Extensive consolidation in the left lung has improved
at the base, worsened in the suprahilar region, and on the right
previously collapsed right lower lobe has re-expanded and is
severely consolidated, findings that suggest widespread
aspiration pneumonia. Gastric and colonic distention and
pneumoperitoneum are also still present. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 81827**] was paged.


Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted [**5-12**] to the ICU due to respiratory
distress. She was started on Vancomycin/Zosyn for presumptive
pneumonia with poor saturations. She was given nebulizers and
20mg IV lasix x 4 for fluid offloading. She improved
significantly and was able to transfer from the ICU without
significant event.

She received a KUB for increasing abdominal pain which was
notable for increased large bowel distension. She ultimately had
2 large bowel movements with significant improvement of her
abdominal pain. She was transferred from the ICU on [**5-16**] and her
pain regimen was adjusted, she was moved to a regular diet, and
ambulated around the floor. She was discharged in very stable
condition with her pain under control on a normal diet with
modifications.
