Imaging:
CT head ([**3-9**]): IMPRESSION: No acute hemorrhage. Regions of
hypodensity in the right cerebellum and both parietal lobes
could represent prior hemorrhage or infarct. There is dilatation
of the ventricles in a pattern suggesting communicating
hydrocephalus. Correlation with clinical findings may be
helpful.
.
CXR ([**3-9**]): 1. Left basilar and retrocardiac opacity, likely
secondary to a combination of effusion and atelectasis, but
denser areas of consolidation medially with peribronchial
thickening are more suggestive of consolidation secondary to an
infectious process. If possible, lateral radiographs would be
helpful in further evaluating this region.
.
CTA chest ([**3-10**]): 1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism. 2. Left
lower lobe of collapse. No definite endobronchial lesion
identified. 3. Mild CHF/fluid overload with a small left pleural
effusion. 4. Cardiomegaly with secondary signs of ventricular
dysfunction.
.
CXR ([**3-10**]): Persistent left lower lobe consolidation and pleural
effusion, consistent with the history of pneumonia. Prominent
left hilum, which could be further evaluated on a PA and lateral
radiograph when feasible.
.
ECHO ([**3-10**]): The left atrium is normal in size. The right atrium
is moderately dilated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are
normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. There is
mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
probable inferior/inferolateral hypokinesis (views suboptimal).
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed.
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is no
aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild to moderate
([**1-14**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is moderate pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is a small pericardial
effusion with no echocardiographic evidence of tamponade.
.
Microbiology:
blood culture ([**3-9**]): no growth to date
sputum culture ([**3-9**]): contaminated


Brief Hospital Course:
84F Chinese-speaking with PMH dementia, CHF, HTN, goiter, and
large mass involving pancreatic tail with unresponsive episode
while at Nursing Home, likely precipitated by hypoxia/infection
in setting of LLL pneumonia/lung collapse.  Improved with
antibiotics/supportive care in ICU.  Newly-recognized atrial
fibrillation with satisfactory rate control on once-daily
atenolol.  Remains approximately euvolemic.

PLAN:
# LLL PNEUMONIA, COMMUNITY-ACQUIRED
1. Continue levofloxacin x total of 14 days

# ATRIAL FIBRILLATION
1. Coumadin 5 mg daily, will need INR checked in [**2-15**] days.
2. Continue beta-blocker at current dose

# DIASTOLIC HEART FAILURE
1. Continue furosemide 50 [**Hospital1 **]

# PRESUMED CAD
1. ASA, BB

# DEMENTIA/DELIRIUM
1. Avoid benzos, anticholinergic agents
2. Ambulate with assist as tolerated

# PANCREATIC MASS
1. History confirmed per [**Hospital1 336**] records as above; no further
evaluation at this time for presumed incurable neoplasm.

REVIEW OF [**Hospital1 336**] RECORDS: DISCHARGE SUMMARY [**2147-12-5**]
CHEST CT WITH CONTRAST [**2147-12-4**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. Bilateral pleural effusions with accompanying compression
atelectasis and/or consolidation.
2. Narrowed airway at the level of the vocal cords as well as
thyroid with possible mass at the level of the left vocal cord,
laryngoscopic examination is recommended.
3. Multiseptated hypodense likely cystic neoplasm of the
pancreatic tail (6.1 x 5.9cm in largest dimension).  There is a
concern for a malignant neoplastic process, further evaluation
is
recommended.
4. Possible clot vs masses in left atrium, right atrium and
right
atrium/IVC junction, echocardiogram is recommended.
5. Ground-glass opacities in lungs.
6. Cardiomegaly.

Airway narrowing was attributed to longstanding goiter.
Echocardiogram did not confirm intracardiac clot/masses, LVEF
40%
with mild global hypokineses as awell as 2+MR/2+TR.

Regarding pancreatic mass, "There was a family meeting including
the patient herself and the decision was made not to pursue
further workup as the patient was feeling well and did not wish
to pursue invasive testing."
