Admission Date:  [**2119-12-13**]       Discharge Date:  [**2119-12-23**]

Date of Birth:   [**2045-1-6**]       Sex:  F

Service:  [**Location (un) 259**]

ADDENDUM:  The following is a discharge addendum to prior
discharge summary from [**2119-12-17**].

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  HEMATOLOGY:  The patient remained hemodynamically stable
with stable hematocrit (30-34) for the remainder of the
hospitalization.  Per Hematology recommendations, the patient
was started on Lovenox on hospital day number five for
continued anticoagulation in the setting of a deep venous
thrombosis.  However, the patient's INR was noted to be
elevated in the range of 2.5 to 2.7 while on Lovenox and the
patient's anticoagulation was held and subsequently changed
to low-dose Coumadin.  The patient's INR remained in the
therapeutic range (2.0 to 3.0) with infrequent low-dose
Coumadin (0.5 to 1.0 mg q.o.d.).

The patient's right lower extremity remained in a pressure
dressing with progressive decrease in swelling and no further
evidence of bleeding.

2.  INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  The patient was continued on Kefzol
for a total of three days (antibiotic day number seven) given
concern for potential right lower extremity cellulitis,
seeding of the existing hematoma, and/or prosthesis
infection.  Following the patient's initial temperature spike
in the Medical Intensive Care Unit with an associated
elevated white blood count, the patient remained afebrile,
with occasional low-grade fevers and no further signs of
infection.  The Kefzol was discontinued on hospital day
number six, and no further antibiotics were prescribed.

3.  NEUROLOGY:  Status post the [**Hospital 228**] Medical Intensive
Care Unit course, the patient was noted with intermittent
confusion and transient disorientation.  All sedatives and
mind altering medications were discontinued; however, the
patient continued to express concern with her "cloudy
thinking".

Given the patient's risk for bleeding, the patient underwent
a noncontrast head CAT scan on hospital day number ten
without evidence of bleed, mass affect, or midline shift.
The patient remained alert, awake, and oriented at the time
of dictation and no further workup was required.

4.  CARDIOVASCULAR:  The patient was without further episodes
of hypotension and was restarted on a low-dose beta blocker
post non ST elevation myocardial infarction without
complication.  There were no further episodes of chest pain
or evidence of ischemia.  The patient's aspirin was held
secondary to increased risk for bleeding.

A Cardiology consult was obtained with recommendations for
outpatient echocardiogram evaluation of the patient's aortic
valve given the history of aortic stenosis and elective
cardiac catheterization (from the upper extremity) at a
future date.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Good.

DIAGNOSIS ON DISCHARGE:
1.  Aortic stenosis.
2.  Deep venous thrombosis (in the setting of
supratherapeutic INR).
3.  Non ST elevation myocardial infarction.
4.  Hypoxic respiratory failure, status post intubation.
5.  Right groin hematoma.
6.  Status post right total hip replacement (secondary to
osteoarthritis).
7.  History of anxiety.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
1.  Coumadin 0.5 mg q.o.d. (please note the patient is
exquisitely sensitive to Coumadin.  Dosing should be based on
daily INR with goal INR 2.0 to 3.0.)
2.  Metoprolol 12.5 mg p.o. b.i.d.
3.  Lansoprazole 30 mg p.o. q.d.
4.  Librium 5 mg q.a.m. and p.r.n. anxiety.  (Please note,
aspirin held secondary to increased risk for bleeding.)

INSTRUCTIONS ON DISCHARGE:  The patient is to be discharged
to acute rehabilitation for continued physical therapy and
medical management.  The patient was instructed to follow-up
with her primary care physician in one to two weeks post
discharge.  The patient was also instructed to follow-up with
hematologist, Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 6944**], on [**2120-1-5**]
at 11:00 a.m. ([**Hospital Ward Name 23**], [**Location (un) **]).  The patient will require
daily blood work for monitoring of PT/INR with goal INR 2.0
to 3.0.  The patient's right lower extremity remains in a
compression dressing with recommendations to maintain lower
extremity elevation while at rest.  Please note, concern for
infection in the patient's right lower extremity hematoma,
particularly given the proximity of the total hip prosthesis.
