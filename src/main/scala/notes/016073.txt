Pertinent Results:
[**2116-5-5**] Us abdomen
IMPRESSION: No evidence of ascites. Marked splenomegaly. Normal
hepatopetal flow within the portal vein.
.
LE dopplers [**2116-5-5**]
IMPRESSION: No evidence of lower extremity deep vein thrombosis,
bilaterally.

[**2116-5-5**] CT head
IMPRESSION: No hemorrhage, fracture, or evidence of traumatic
injury. No significant change since multiple prior head CTs.
.
[**2116-5-6**] CXR
FINDINGS: In comparison with study of [**5-5**], the patient has
taken a much better inspiration. The right IJ catheter remains
in the mid-lower portion of the SVC. The bilateral fluffy
opacifications are much less prominent. In view of the rapid
time course, these could have represented transient edema or
some crowding of vessels related to the low lung volume.

Brief Hospital Course:
53M with Hep C cirrhosis, severe pulmonary hypertension presents
after being found down at home, found to be dehydrated and
encephalopathic. He was initially admitted to the ICU for
hypotension, and then transferred to the floor the next day.
.
Hospital Course:
.
Hypotension: Likely related to volume depletion, as he may have
been down for a considerable amount of time given his increase
in creatinine and apparent pre-renal state. This resolved with
fluids. Infectious etiology ruled out with blood cultures, CXR
and urine cultures. His diuretics were intially held. a cortisol
stimulation test was performed and he did not respond. This was
likely secondary to known adrenal insufficiency. They diuretics
were restarted when his blood pressure had been stable for 48
hours to prevent ascites and to relieve LE edema.
.
Encephalopathy: Likely had excephalopathy in setting of protein
load (2 pork chops) and dehydration. It is also likely that
patient not compliant with medications. While here, he was
continued in lactulose to 30mL QID (60mL at first) and continue
rifaximin 200mg TID. He had asterixis on admission and was A&O
x1. This respolved and his mental status returned to [**Location 59563**]
prior to discharge.
.
HCV Cirrhosis with grade I esophageal varices: MELD 20. His
diuretics were intially held secondary to hypotension. On
hospital dy 2, he was restarted Lasix 40mg daily and
spironolactone 100mg daily today. He was also continued on
propranolol 40mg daily.
.
pulmonary hypertension: Likely combination of underlying
pulmonary hypertension. Hypoxia on admission resolved. He was
continued on home oxygen while he was here and was also
continued Sildenafil 25 mg po TID. A follow up appointment with
pulmonary was made, as no additional intevention could be
planned while he was here with encephalopathy.
.
ARF: [**1-12**] on admission. baseline 1.0-1.2. ARF likely [**1-11**] volume
depletion, and improved quickly with rehydration to 0.9 on
discharge.

Adrenal Insufficiency: He has hx of this, did thus not respond
to [**Last Name (un) 104**] stim. He was continued on hose dose of hydrocortisone
20mg AM, 10mg PM.

Hx of seizure disorder. this could have cause confusion and
collapse, although doesnt explain dehydration. While here, he
