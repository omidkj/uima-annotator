Surgeon:  [**Name6 (MD) **] [**Name8 (MD) **], M.D.  [**MD Number(1) 40652**]

CHIEF  COMPLAINT:  Postoperative desaturation and respiratory
distress.

HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a [**Age over 90 **]-year-old
female  resident  of [**Hospital3 **], who has a history
of  coronary  artery  disease,  chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease,  dementia,  and hypertension.  The patient presented
after  a fall on [**2159-5-12**] with a left hip fracture, which was
pinned  in the operating room by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 12528**].  Postoperatively,
the patient was extubated and experienced a desaturation with
cyanosis.    She  was  re-intubated  and  sent to the Medical
Intensive   Care   Unit.      The   patient  was  transiently
hypertensive  in the operating room requiring a Nipride drip.

where  she  was  extubated  within  hours.    The patient was
agitated  requiring  restraint.  Code status was DNR and DNI.
The  patient  was  found  to  have  a  bandemia and there was
concern  for  a  possible  pneumonia  versus  other source of
infection.   The patient was subsequently found to have an E.
coli  UTI.    The  patient  had  a  CT  angiogram to look for
pulmonary  embolism,  which  was  negative.   The patient was
started on Levofloxacin.  She was continued on Clindamycin as
per the Orthopedic Department.

SUMMARY  OF  HOSPITAL  COURSE:    This  a  [**Age over 90 **]-year-old female
resident  of [**Hospital1 5595**], who presented with history of COPD on home
oxygen,  chronically,  question  of  coronary artery disease,
hypertension,  and  dementia, who presented post hip fracture
and  open  reduction  and internal fixation with desaturation
and cyanosis, status post re-intubation and extubation.

#1.  PULMONARY:  The patient has history of COPD with chronic
history of desaturations of 70s and 80s and 02 requirement at
baseline.    The patient was re-intubated postoperatively for
what  seemed  to  be  consistent  with one of her episodes of
desaturation.      The   patient   was   easily   weaned   to
pressor-support  ventilation  in  the  Medical Intensive Care
Unit  and  extubated.   The patient's presentation was likely
complicated  by her baseline of COPD and question of possible
pneumonia.    The  patient was given Albuterol, Atrovent, and
nebulizer  treatment  and  oxygen  supplementation.   She was
treated for 7 to 10 days with Levofloxacin 500 mg p.o.q.d.

#2.    CARDIOVASCULAR:    The patient has history of coronary
artery  disease  and transient hypertensive episode requiring
Nipride  drip.    The  patient  is  on  a  cardiac regimen of
Lopressor.    She  had no episodes of chest pain upon leaving
the Medical Intensive Care Unit.

#3.     HEMATOLOGIC:    The  patient  presented  with  anemia
postoperatively and this was thought to secondary to dilution
as well as other loses.  The hematocrit was followed closely.
She was guaiac negative.

#4.  NEUROPSYCHIATRIC:  The patient presented with history of
dementia  and  episodes  of  agitation  and  sundowning.  The
patient  did not require anything other than soft restraints.

#5.  CODE STATUS:  The patient was DNR/DNI.

#6.    INFECTIOUS  DISEASE:    The  patient  has E. coli UTI,
treated  with  Levofloxacin 500 mg p.o.q.d.  There was also a
question  of  a small pneumonia on the chest x-ray, although,
the  patient  did  not  have  clinical  symptoms that greatly
supported  that.    She was maintained on Levofloxacin 500 mg
p.o.q.d. for a course of 7 to 10 days.

#7.    ORTHOPEDIC:  The patient is status post open reduction
and  internal  fixation  of  the left hip.  The Department of
Orthopedics  followed  the  patient  in  the hospital and she
received Clindamycin perioperatively as prophylaxis.  She was
also treated with Lovenox 30 mg subcutaneously q.12.

She  will followup with the orthopedic surgeon, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 12528**], on
