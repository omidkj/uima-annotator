History of Present Illness:
This is a [**Age over 90 **]yoF w/h/o of dementia and prior admissions for
hypotension associated w/UTI who p/w altered MS [**First Name (Titles) 767**] [**Last Name (Titles) 5348**]
dementia and hypotension.  Per report, pt was found at dinner at
[**Doctor Last Name **] House having difficulty following commands and difficulty

but bumped to 90s w/IV fluid bolus. She was found to have new
onset a.fib w/ rate in the 120's to 130's and lateral ST
depressions c/w demand ischemia. Troponin was mildly elevated at
0.05, CK flat. Bedside echo was performed which showed
hypokinetic appearing wall motion. She had a negative U/A, CXR
showed small left pleural effusion o/w no evidence of PNA and
CTH was negative. Prior to tx to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], her SBP was 102.

EKG:

Imaging:

CT Head [**2101-1-23**]:
1. No intracranial hemorrhage, cerebral edema, or evidence of
acute major vascular territorial infarction.
2. Paranasal sinus mucosal thickening and opacification as
described.

CXR [**2101-1-23**]:
Top normal heart size and the mediastinal contours are
unchanged. The aorta is tortuous as before. There are low
inspiratory lung volumes. The medial left hemidiaphragm is
somewhat obscured relative to the prior studies, probably due to
mild retrocardiac atelectasis. No focal consolidation is seen.
The left costophrenic sulcus is blunted, probably due to small
left pleural effusion. There is no pneumothorax. Bones are
demineralized.

CXR [**2101-1-24**]:
In comparison with the previous examination, there are newly
appeared bilateral small pleural effusions and bilateral
perihilar haziness. Both changes are consistent with
mild-to-moderate fluid overload. Newly appeared retrocardiac
atelectasis. The size of the cardiac silhouette is unchanged. No
signs suggestive of pneumonia.

TTE [**2101-1-24**]:
The left atrium is [**Month/Day/Year 1914**]. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and systolic
function (LVEF>55%). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an
increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral
valve prolapse. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion. There is an anterior space
which most likely represents a fat pad.
IMPRESSION: Moderate mitral regurgitation. Preserved left
ventricular systolic function. The right ventricle is not well
seen but may be dilated and mildly hypokinetic.
