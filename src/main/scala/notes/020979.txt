Brief Hospital Course:
Admitted from [**Hospital1 882**] [**3-9**]. BP controlled with IV
nitroglycerin, hydralazine, and lopressor initially. Carotid U/S
performed for prior CVA preoperatively.This revealed less than
40% bilat. stenoses. Preop echo also showed apical HK and EF
55%.Pt.had poor peripheral venous access. Metoprolol changed to
labetalol. Norvasc was restarted also for better BP control.
Patient was also on plavix and had renal insufficiency so
surgery was delayed while his creatinine was permitted to
decrease as well as the effects of the plavix wearing off.
Underwent cabg x4 by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on [**3-22**] with LIMA to LAD, SVG to
diag, SVG to OM2, and SVG to PDA. Intraop TEE showed EF 60% and
1+ MR. Transferred to CSRU on titrated propofol and
neosynephrine drips.

Initial chest tube drainage was 220 cc sero-sang. CXR later
showed large left hemothorax. A new CT was placed and old one
removed. This drained 1.5 L of blood. Received 1 u prbc. CXR did
not improve. Thoracic was consulted and bronchoscopy was clear.
Clot was presumed per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]. Weaned and extubated. On NTG
for bp control. Initial Sat 93% on 60% FT. IV Labetalol and
hydralazine also added. He had some confusion. Lasix diuresis
was started. Required SS reg. insulin. L apical PTX on AM CXR on
POD#3. Postop creatinine elev. to 2.8. Aggressive pulm. toilet
was done for increased secretions, poor cough, rhonchi and nebs
added. Swallow OK per eval. on POD #4. Using [**Doctor Last Name 2598**] lift to
chair.

Resp. distress on POD #9 - reintubated and sedated. New left
subclav. line and nasal feeding tube. Pacing wires DCed. Creat
still rising to 3.1. Bronch. again [**4-1**]. Open trach and PEG done
[**4-3**]. WBC rose to 23. CT removed. Neo weaning. Received bicarb
for some acidosis and wound nurse consulted for right gluteal
pressure sore. On POD #18, the patient stopped moving his left
side. There was question of seizure activity and his neuro
status deteriorated. Dilantin was started. He withdrew to
tactile stimuli and neuro was consulted. CT scan and EEG were
done and neuro workup was negative. Impression was a metabolic
leukoencephalopathy. Tube feeds were now at goal via PEG. ABX
switched to linezolid, and then changed to a 14 day course of
meropenem 1000mg IV q12 hours. Pathogen is Burkholdera cepacia.
Tolerating tube feeds. Occasionally follows commands. Now using
trach mask 2 hours at a time with minimal pressure support rest
at 5/5 and [**4-3**]. His encephalopathy is clearing slowly. Day 10
of 14 abx today [**5-10**]. Last dose is [**5-14**]. Stable and ready for
discharge to rehab today.
