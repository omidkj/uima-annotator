Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2181**]
Chief Complaint:
Leg pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Parathyroidectomy
FNA Thyroid


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 58 year old male with history of CAD s/p CABG
([**2175**]), hyperparathyrodism with parathyroid adenoma (dx'd [**2175**]),
type 2 DM, CHF (EF 20%), "fast heart rate" and CKD who presents
with leg pain. The patient presented to the ED after arising
from his bed and hearing a 'snap' in his left leg. He
subsequently he had difficulty moving the leg and was concerned
that it broke. He also reported two similar episodes: first last
[**Month (only) **] he felt a painful click in his right forearm which
developed into a soft mound and second on New Year's Eve he
heard a snap in his right UE, followed by pain and ecchymosis
which lasted for weeks.
.
In ED, plain film of his pelvis showed a possible chronic
superior/inferior pubic rami fracture with lucencies/lytic
lesions in long bones. He was evaluated by orthopedics in the
ED. The plan was for CT of the pelvis and possible surgery. He
refused both the surgery as well as the CT scan and was admitted
to medicine for clearance.
.
Of note, he was also found to be hyperkalemic with a K of 6.2.
He was given kayexalate and repeat K 5.3. Calcium on admission
was 12.7 - per OMR this is chronic hypercalcemia [**3-16**]
hyperparathyroidism.
.
Review of systems was negative for fevers, chills, night sweats,
weight loss - in fact patient had 70lb wt gain over 2 years -
chest pain, shortness of breath, lightheadedness, dizziness,
palpitations. He had no dysuria, hematuria. Only complaint is
pain in left leg. Sometimes feels as though wearing socks/shoes,
poor movement of LE.


Past Medical History:
# CAD s/p CABG, [**2175-7-6**] - 3V CABG with a saphenous vein graft
to the CMI, saphenous vein graft to the right posterior
descending artery  (with a proximal anastomosis from the
diagonal), and a saphenous vein graft to the diagonal.
# hyperparathyroidism (adenoma)- chronic hypercalcemia, ?bone
pains, renal insuff, but has not undergone surgery. He was seen
by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in [**2175**], was recommended surgery, but patient
did not follow up.
# CHF- EF 20% pre-CABG, no recent ECHO on file
# chronic knee pain
# CKD- Cr 2.4; suspected secondary to hypercalcemia, DM
# PAF


Social History:
The patient has a 15 pack year history. Quit smoking after CABG.
Worked as bookmaker for sports gambling. No alcohol, no drugs.

Family History:
The patient's father died at age 86 of coronary artery disease
and also had hypertension. The patient's mother died of stomach
cancer. Patient is an only child. He has two children aged 18
and 19 who are alive and well. ? Father had paget's disease. No
history of DM or thyroid disease.

Discharge Labs:

Reports:
[**2181-5-9**] pelvis xray-
IMPRESSION:
1. Fractures of the left superior and inferior pubic ramus of
uncertain chronicity.
2. Curvilinear lucency in the left femoral head is suspicious
for fracture.
3. Lytic lesion in the left femoral mid shaft may represent a
brown tumor given the patient's history of aggressive
hyperparathyroidism, however aggresive tumor such as metastasis
or myeloma cannot be excluded.
.
CXR: neg for PNA/PTX
.
EKG: afib w/ ventricular rate 110's
.
[**5-10**] Echo: Conclusions:
The left atrium is markedly dilated. The right atrium is
markedly dilated. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color
Doppler. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
The left ventricular cavity is mildly dilated. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (ejection
fraction 20 percent) secondary to akinesis of the inferior wall
and at least moderate hypokinesis of the rest of the left
ventricle. Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left
ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular
chamber size is normal. Right ventricular systolic function
appears depressed. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild to moderate
([**2-13**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Moderate [2+] tricuspid
regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial effusion.
.
[**2181-5-10**] CT Pelvis:IMPRESSION:
1. Diffusely abnormal study with multifocal lytic expansile soft
tissue density masses throughout the visualized pelvis. These
masses may be related to very aggressive forms of brown tumors
in the setting of longstanding hyperparathyroidism. However,
given the nonspecific as well as heterogeneous appearance,
metastatic malignancy musct also be considered.
2. Acute pathologic fracture involving the left femoral neck
3. Chronic appearing pathologic fractures involving the left
superior and inferior pubic rami, also secondary to expansile
soft tissue masses.
4. Lesion in diaphysis of left femur, with endosteal scalloping
which creates risk for pathologic fx at this second site.
5. Multiple lesions with interrupted cortex, as described
including lesion of the right anterior acetbulum/ramus, which
represent, by definition, pathologic fractures.
.
[**2181-5-10**] CT Femur: 1. Soft tissue density mass within the mid
femoral diaphysis causing significant endosteal scalloping,
which may be at risk for pathologic fracture.
2. Redemonstration of pathologic fracture of the left femoral
neck, as discussed on the CT of the pelvis. These lesions again
may reflect aggressive form of brown tumors, though other
metastatic lesion should be considered in the differential.
.
[**2181-5-13**] Renal US: IMPRESSION: Limited evaluation of the kidneys
secondary to patient's increased body habitus and inability to
comply with necessary maneuvers. No evidence of nephrocalcinosis
or hydronephrosis identified. A small simple cyst is identified
within the upper pole of the left kidney. Mass lesions on the
right kidney cannot be completely ruled out on this study.
.
[**2181-5-14**] Thyroid US: IMPRESSION:
1. 3.9 x 3.8 x 3.2 cm nodule posterior and lateral to the
inferior pole of the left thyroid lobe likely represents a
parathyroid nodule.
2. Interval enlargement of the right thyroid lobe and isthmus
nodules.
3. 1.4 x 0.8 x 0.9 cm hypoechogenic nodule adjacent to the lower
pole of the left thyroid lobe cannot cannot distinct lymph node
from another parathyroid adenoma.
.
Forearm film: MPRESSION:
1. Expansile osseous lesion of the distal right ulnar diaphysis
with ill-defined margins, associated cortical destruction, and
numerous bony trabeculations running through the center of the
mass. Given the patient's history, the possibility of a brown
tumor in this location must b
