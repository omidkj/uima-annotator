Service:  Vascular Surgery

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 69-year-old
gentleman with a past medical history significant for
longstanding diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease, and
peripheral vascular disease who had been followed by Dr.
[**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] for a painful nonhealing ulceration in the
medial aspect of his right fifth toe.  The patient had been
treated for this ulceration with a combination of saline and
topical antibiotic ointments.  He was referred to Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] from Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] the Department of Podiatry.

The patient had an arteriogram performed to evaluate his
peripheral vascular disease.  This demonstrated patent
aortoiliac, femoral, and popliteal vessels.  The trifurcation
was occluded with reconstitution of he proximal peroneal
artery.

Therefore, the patient was to be admitted for an elective
right below-knee popliteal to peroneal artery bypass graft.
However, the patient developed a progressively worsening foot
pain, redness, swelling, and cyanosis of the foot at the
right fifth toe.  Therefore, he came to the Emergency
Department at this institution two days prior to his elective
surgery.

The patient denied fevers, chills, nausea, vomiting, chest
pain, shortness of breath, abdominal pain, and back pain.  He
reports claudication at approximately [**Age over 90 **] yards to 200 yards
which has been persistent for the last two to three years.
Therefore, he was admitted for antibiotics and pain control
prior to his surgery.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.
2.  Coronary artery disease; status post coronary artery
bypass graft.
3.  Hypertension.
4.  Congestive heart failure.
5.  Hypercholesterolemia.
6.  Peripheral vascular disease.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:
1.  Status post coronary artery bypass graft in [**2192**].
2.  Status post left carotid endarterectomy.
3.  Status post cataract surgery.
4.  Status post left knee arthroscopy.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1.  Captopril 100 mg by mouth three times per day
2.  Humalog 20 units subcutaneously at 7 a.m. and 18 units
subcutaneously at 12 p.m. and 16 units subcutaneously at 6:30
p.m.
3.  Lantus 40 units subcutaneously at hour of sleep.
4.  Protonix 40 mg by mouth once per day.
5.  Levoxyl 100 mcg by mouth once per day.
6.  Lasix 40 mg by mouth once per day.
7.  Aspirin 81 mg by mouth once per day.
8.  Lipitor 10 mg by mouth once per day.
9.  Multivitamin one tablet by mouth once per day.

ALLERGIES:  SULFA.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Physical examination
revealed the patient was afebrile with a blood pressure of
150/70.  The patient was alert and oriented times three and
appeared healthy.  In no apparent distress.  Neck examination
revealed a left surgical scar with a bruit on the right.  No
masses.  Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat examination
revealed the oropharynx was clear.  The mucous membranes were
moist.  Heart was regular in rate and rhythm.  The lungs were
clear to auscultation bilaterally.  The abdomen was soft,
nontender, and nondistended.  Extremity examination revealed
right foot erythema with an ulceration on the medial aspect
of the fifth right toe which probed to bone.  There were
bilateral saphenous vein graft harvest scars.  Vascular
examination demonstrated palpable femoral, radial, and
popliteal pulses bilaterally.  There were dopplerable pulses
in the dorsalis pedis and posterior tibialis arteries
bilaterally.

PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:  The patient's
white blood cell count was 14.2, his hematocrit was 41, and
his platelet count was 262.  The patient's partial
thromboplastin time was 26.9 and his INR was 1.1.  The
potassium was 4.9.  His blood urea nitrogen was 27.  His
creatinine was 1.

PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  A chest x-ray revealed a small
right pleural effusion.

Electrocardiogram did not reveal any ischemic changes and was
consistent with prior studies.

Vein mapping of the bilateral upper and lower extremities as
part of his preoperative workup revealed patent lesser
saphenous, cephalic, and basilic veins bilaterally.  The
greater saphenous veins were absent and had been used for his
coronary artery bypass graft surgery.

CONCISE SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE BY ISSUE/SYSTEM:  The
patient was admitted under the care of Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]
and was started on antibiotics including vancomycin,
levofloxacin, and metronidazole.

The patient was maintained on bed rest with dry dressing
changes and antibiotics until hospital day three.  At this
time, the patient was taken to the operating room where a
right below-knee popliteal to peroneal bypass graft using a
left cephalic vein was performed.

The Cardiology Service was consulted prior to surgery and
recommended perioperative beta blockade.  This was
implemented, and the patient tolerated his surgery well
without complications.

Postoperatively, the patient was discharged to the Vascular
Intensive Care Unit for close monitoring.  Postoperatively,,
the patient had a dopplerable dorsalis pedis and posterior
tibialis pulses on the right with a warm right foot.  The
patient was maintained on antibiotics and was transferred to
the hospital floor on [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] day one.

At this time, it was decided that the patient's right fifth
toe ulceration would not likely heal despite his recent
surgery.  Therefore, he was scheduled for a right fifth toe
amputation.  This surgery was performed on [**2194-1-10**].
The procedure was performed using local anesthesia, and the
patient was discharged to the regular hospital floor in good
condition.

Postoperatively, the patient's antibiotic regimen was changed
to oxacillin, levofloxacin, and Flagyl.  He remained on bed
rest until [**Year (4 digits) **] day five following his bypass graft
and [**Year (4 digits) **] day two following his toe amputation.  The
remainder of his [**Year (4 digits) **] course was uneventful.  His
antibiotic regimen was converted to dicloxacillin,
levofloxacin, and Flagyl on [**Year (4 digits) **] day days five and
two.

With the assistance of Physical Therapy, the patient
progressed to heel touch weightbearing on the right lower
extremity with right lower extremity elevation while in bed.
He was discharged to home with a visiting nurse [**First Name (Titles) **]
[**Last Name (Titles) **] days seven and four.  The patient was sent home
on clindamycin and levofloxacin for approximately two weeks.
He was to have visiting nurse services to assist with
physical therapy and wound care.

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  Condition on discharge was good.
