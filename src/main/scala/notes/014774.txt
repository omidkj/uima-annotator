Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was brought to the Operating Room on [**2162-5-27**] where
the patient underwent CABG x 4 with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  Overall the
patient tolerated the procedure well and post-operatively was
transferred to the CVICU in stable condition for recovery and
invasive monitoring.
POD 1 found the patient extubated, alert and oriented and
breathing comfortably.  The patient was neurologically [**Last Name (STitle) 5235**]
and hemodynamically stable, weaned from inotropic and
vasopressor support.  Beta blocker was initiated and the patient
was gently diuresed toward the preoperative weight.  The patient
was transferred to the telemetry floor for further recovery.
Chest tubes and pacing wires were discontinued without
complication.  He developed rate-controlled atrial fibrillation
for a short duration.  This resolved with amiodarone and
titration of beta blocker.  The patient was evaluated by the
physical therapy service for assistance with strength and
mobility.  By the time of discharge on POD 4 the patient was
ambulating freely, the wound was healing and pain was controlled
with oral analgesics.  The patient was discharged home with VNA
in good condition with appropriate follow up instructions.
