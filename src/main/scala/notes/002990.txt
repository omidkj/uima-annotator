Pertinent Results:
[**2151-3-26**] Cardiac Catheterization
1. Two vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Patent native LAD, SVG-OM, and SVG-RCA unchanged from prior.
3. Severe aortic stenosis.
4. Severe mitral regurgitation.
5. Mild systolic ventricular dysfunction.
6. Elevated biventricular filling pressures.
7. Severe pulmonary hypertension.
[**2151-4-2**] ECHO
PRE-BYPASS: The left atrium is moderately dilated. No
spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the
left atrium or left atrial appendage. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. There is mild global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF
= 45 %). The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with
mild global free wall hypokinesis. The ascending, transverse and
descending thoracic aorta are normal in diameter and free of
atherosclerotic plaque. There are simple atheroma in the
ascending aorta. There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the
descending thoracic aorta. The aortic valve leaflets are
severely thickened/deformed. There is critical aortic valve
stenosis (valve area <0.8cm2). Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There
is severe mitral annular calcification. There is severe
thickening of the mitral valve chordae. Moderate (2+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There
is no pericardial effusion.

Final Report
CHEST RADIOGRAPH
INDICATION: Triple lumen change over wire, evaluation of line
placement.
COMPARISON: [**2151-4-5**].
FINDINGS: As compared to the previous examination, the right
central venous introduction sheath has been removed and
exchanged against a central venous access line. The tip of this
access line projects over the leads of the pacemaker and is
difficult to visualize but appears to be positioned at the
inflow tract of the right atrium.
No evidence of complications, notably no pneumothorax.
Subtle increase of bilateral basal opacities. Unchanged size of
the cardiac silhouette.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

 OROPHARYNGEAL VIDEOFLUOROSCOPIC SWALLOWING EVALUATION
EVALUATION:
An oral and pharyngeal swallowing videofluoroscopy was performed
today in collaboration with Radiology.  Thin liquid,
Nectar-thick
liquid, and pureed consistency barium were administered. Results
follow:
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. PO diet: soft solids, thin liquids
2. PO meds whole with thin liquids as tolerated
3. TID oral care
4. Strict aspiration precautions including:
   a) sit fully upright for all PO intake
   b) alternate between bites and sips to clear oropharynx
   c) swallow twice per bite as needed to clear oropharynx
   d) swallow-cough-swallow with ALL liquids including when
taking meds
5. ENT eval in if vocal quality does not continue to improve
6. Swallow follow up in rehab setting to ensure tolerating diet,
re-assess need for swallow-cough-swallow maneuver.
These recommendations were shared with the patient, the nurse
and
the medical team.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2151-3-26**] for work up of
her chest pain during hemodialysis. She underwent a cardiac
catheterization which revealed two vessel coronary artery
disease with patent grafts froom her previous bypass syrgery.
Severe aortic stenosis and mitral regurgitation were also noted.
Given the severity of her valvular disease, the cardiac surgical
service was consulted for evaluation for redo surgery. She was
accepted for AVR/MVR and on [**4-2**] she was brought to the
operating room for aortic and mitral valve replacement. Please
see OR report for details, in summmary she had: 1. Redo
sternotomy with aortic valve replacement with a 19-mm St. [**Hospital 923**]
Medical Biocor Epic Supra tissue heart valve.
2. Mitral valve replacement, 27-mm St. [**Hospital 923**] Medical Biocor Epic
tissue valve.
She tolerated the operation well and was transferred from the
operating room to the cardiac surgery ICU in stable condition.
She was sedated through the night on the surgical day, the
following day see awoke and followed commands but remained
intubated as she was somewhat lethargic and she needed to have
hemodialysis prior to extubation to support her pulmonary
status. She was
