History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 16696**] is a 39 year old female with a history of HTN, IDDM,
non-ischemic cardiomyopathy with EF 45% s/p recent
hospitalization for VF arrest with ICD placement after arctic
sun protcol, nonobstructive CAD, and ESRD on HD who is
transferred to the emergency room from her rehabilitation center
for a low hematocrit.

The patient was recently admitted on [**2198-12-3**] status post cardiac
arrest while at dialysis, thought to be secondary to hypokalemia
with a presumed R on T phenomenon lead to VT --> VF arrest.  She
underwent Arctic sun cooling and re-warming, successful
extubation following prior failed attempt (required
re-intubation due to mucous plugging), and gradual recovery of
her baseline mental status, after frequent
work with PT and speech and swallow to resume PO intake. She was

dialyzed in-house by the renal team with a high K bath to
maintain her K around 5. EP placed a single chamber ICD (despite
significant concerns regarding her multiple comorbidities). She
had
evidence of significant ectopy on telemetry throughout her
hospitalization including frequent PVC's and occasional runs of
NSVT. She was discharged to rehab for continued recovery of her
physical function.
.
In the ED, initial VS were: 98.2 85 157/73 18 100% 2L.  She
received 1 unit pRBCs for a hematocrit of 22.2.  Other labs were
notable for a BUN/creatinine of 29/4.4, bicarb of 33, Trop of
0.08 in the setting of CRF, and a hapto <5 with normal bilirubin
and slightly elevated LDH at 330.  Most notably, she felt unwell
and her glucose returned at 35.  She was given D50 and a repeat
fingerstick was 158.  Repeat at 12:15 = 60 and she was given
another amp of D50 with re-check at 1:20 = 50.  Another amp was
given and she also ate a [**Country 1073**] [**Location (un) 6002**].  Another repeat at
2:45 = 45 and one more amp of D50 adminstered.  Total D50 amps
x4.  She was also complaining of worsening chest pain with EKG
showing no change from prior and improvement with morphine.  CXR
showed no acute process.  She was given Protonix 40mg IV for ?GI
bleed.  She is admitted to the ICU for persistent hypoglycemia
in the setting of receiving her long-acting insulin at rehab
without eating.
.
On arrival to the MICU, she reported that she was itching since
the blood started.  Also, she denied hematochezia, hematemesis,
hematoptysis, and menstruation.  She reported that she has been
fatigued in the past week and has had a "head cold".  She
confirmed that she took her insulin but did not eat.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 16696**] is a 39 year old female with a history of
hypertension (HTN), insulin dependent diabetes (IDDM),
non-ischemic cardiomyopathy with EF 45% status post recent
hospitalization for vfib arrest with ICD placement, and end
stage renal disease (ESRD on HD), now presenting with a low
hematocrit and persistent hypoglycemia.
.
ACTIVE ISSUES BY PROBLEM:
# Persistent hypogylcemia:  Patient states that she did get her
4units of long-acting insulin + 10units humalog at the rehab
night prior to admission as well as 8units humalog in the
morning.  After this, she did not have anything to eat.  She has
a history of being very sensitive to insulin.  She was treated
with IV fluids with dextrose 5% in half-normal saline and her
blood sugars were measured every 1 hour in the ICU.  Also, she
was able to eat a diabetic/cardiac diet.  She corrected her
sugars quickly and was able to start her home insulin regimen.
.
# Acute on chronic Anemia: She recieved one unit of packed RBCs
in the emergency department.  The differential includes gradual
downtrend secondary to kidney disease and nutritional
deficiencies vs. source of bleeding or intravascular hemolysis.
She denies any bleeding outside the body and does not endorse
pain consistent with internal bleeding.  Although her
haptoglobin was very low and her LDH was mildly elevated, her
other hemolysis labs (Tbili, INR) were not consistent with
ongoing hemolysis.  Her RDW was already elevated which argued
against an acute bleed.  Also, she has an MCV in the range of
98-100s which suggests chronic synthetic deficiencies including
B12 and folate, or mixed picture anemia. Further review of her
past hamtocrits shos that she had an acute drop following
placement of her ICD likley related to per-procedural blood
loss. She was given 2 units PRBCs at dialysis on the day of
discharge.
.
CHRONIC ISSUES BY PROBLEM:
# Non-ischemic cardiomyopathy status post ICD: Significant
history which we think is due to prolonged QT interval and then
electrolyte abnormalities, known to have minimal coronary artery
stenosis.  Continued home BB, ACE-i, statin, and ASA.
.
# ESRD on HD:  Cause is likely combination HTN/DM nephropathy.
She was dialysed on her schedule with high K bath.
.
# Hypothyroidism: continued home levothyroxine
.
# Epilepsy: continued home antiepileptics
.
# PPD: placed in rehab on
