This is a discharge summary for [**2166-7-7**], the patient is being
transferred to [**Hospital3 1810**] for cardiac surgery
tomorrow.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Baby girl [**Known lastname 3908**] [**Known lastname 56442**], twin B,
is a now 83-day-old, ex-30-week preterm infant, who is
corrected at 41 6/7 weeks' gestation.  Please see prior
dictations for detailed history.

In brief, [**Known lastname 3908**] has had a prolonged hospitalization with
cardiac anomalies noted early in life by echocardiogram.
Specifically, [**Known lastname 3908**] has an atretic pulmonary artery which
early on was supplied distally by collaterals off the
innominate.  More recently on repeat echocardiograms, this
small vessel has been more difficult to identify.  A cardiac
MRI was performed on [**2166-6-23**] at [**Hospital1 1926**] which confirmed
absent right pulmonary artery with primitive aortapulmonary
collaterals.

With this cardiac lesion, [**Known lastname 3908**] has had a more prolonged
and complicated hospitalization.  Her twin brother went home
two weeks ago and has been doing well.  In contrast, [**Known lastname 3908**]
has had persistent feeding difficulties, likely related to
some component of cardiac failure.

HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM:

Respiratory:  In the beginning of [**Last Name (LF) 205**], [**Known lastname 3908**] was still on a
small amount of oxygen, approximately 13-25 cc by nasal
cannula.  She had been initiated on a short Lasix trial to
see if her work of breathing and oxygen requirement could be
weaned.  She appeared to respond with less respiratory
symptoms and a gradual decrease in oxygen requirement.  With
this response, a decision was made to start her on chronic
diuretics with Diuril.  She has now been on Diuril at 40 mg/kg
divided b.i.d. since [**5-27**].  She has demonstrated a nice
response to diuretics with weaning to room air approximately
three or four days later.  Serial chest x-rays through this
month have consistently been read as increased pulmonary
vascularity.  She remains in RA, with mild subcostal
retractions, and tires easily with PO feeds.  No distress or
oxygen need has been noted for over 3 weeks.

Cardiovascular:  As described above, [**Known lastname 3908**] has
cardiovascular anomalies for which she is being followed by
[**Hospital1 **] Cardiology.  Her primary cardiologist is Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].  [**Known lastname 3908**] has a soft Grade I/VI systolic murmur which has
not changed much in character through this month.  She has not
had an echocardiogram since her hospitalization at [**Hospital1 **]
(see prior dictations).  One will be obtained today at
[**Hospital1 **] prior to surgery.  Surgical repair is planned
tomorrow [**2166-7-8**].

Fluids, Electrolytes and Nutrition:  [**Known lastname 56453**] response to
diuretics led to a decision to fluid restrict her this month.
As a result, we dropped back to 130 cc/kilogram/day and
increased her feedings to 32 Kcal/oz.  She has been gaining
weight well and we reduced her calories to 30 kcal/oz on
[**2166-7-2**].  She continues to gain weight well on Similac or
breast milk fortified with [**Doctor Last Name **] to 24 cal/oz plus polycose and
MCT oil to total 30 cal/oz.  In addition, she receives promod
supplementation.  After surgery, she may not need as many
calories for growth.  Currently she takes [**11-23**] to [**11-22**] of her
total feeds PO, the rest is gavaged.  We have been monitoring
her electrolytes closely with her chronic diuretic use.  The
most recent set on [**7-1**] were reassuring (Na 139, K
4.2, CL 103, and tCO2 26).  [**Known lastname 3908**] receives KCl supps at 4
mEq per G-tube b.i.d.

Hematology:  [**Known lastname 3908**] has been followed for anemia of
prematurity with a most recent hematocrit on [**6-19**] of 26
with a reticulocyte count of 2.4 and she was transfused 20
cc/kg at that time.  No follow up hct was done.

[**Known lastname 3908**] has been on iron throughout this month.

Ophthalmology:  [**Known lastname 56453**] eyes were determined to be immature
on [**5-12**].  A repeat examination on [**6-2**] found mature
retinal vessels present.  Ophthalmology recommended follow up
in nine months.

Health Maintenance:  [**Known lastname 3908**] received her two month
immunizations on [**6-13**] including hepatitis B No. 2, DTAP
No. 1, HIB No. 1, IPV No. 1 and Prevnar No. 1.  Newborn state
screens have been sent and are normal.  Hearing screen was
done on [**5-13**] and she passed.

cals/oz.  Promod [**11-24**] teaspoon per 50 cc breastmilk or per 60
cc Similac.  PO/PG.

2.  Meds: Ferrous Sulfate (concentration 25 mg/ml) 0.3 cc

6.  Immunization series as per general pediatric
recommendations. Other immunizations recommended: A. Synagis
RSV prophylaxis should be conisdered from [**Month (only) 359**] through

airway abnormalities, or school age siblings; or 3) with
chronic lung disease.

B.  Influenza immunization is recommended annually in the fall
for all infants once they reach 6 months of age.  Before this
age and for the first 24 months of the child's life,
immunization against influenza is recommended for household
contacts and out-of-home caregivers.
