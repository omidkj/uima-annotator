Chief Complaint:
E. Coli bacteremia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
colonoscopy


History of Present Illness:
68 year old female with history of cirrhosis from AIH on
transplant list, and celiac dx, who presented to OSH 1 week ago
with abrupt onset of rigors, F/C, diarrhea which awoke her from
sleep.  On admission her temp was 104 but was and remained
hemodynamically stable.  Blood  cxs drawn on admission grew [**1-2**]
pan sensitive E. Coli and Urine cx grew MSSA.  Her creatinine
was slightly elevated on admission at 1.2 but trended down with
IVFs.  She was initially treated with IV Cipro and gent and
later switched to PO Cipro.  She defervesced and subsequent
cultures were negative.  Stool cultures were also negative.  W/U
for the source of bacteremia included an Abd CT w/o contrast
which showed a moderately distended GB, ascites, ? inflammatory
changes involving R colon and mid small gut, and decreased
density of renal pyramids suggestive of chronic UPJ obstruction;
RUQ U/S wich showed sludge with moderately distended GB, MRCP
which showed very large BF showing areas of decreased signal in
region of GB neck/prox cystic duct but no definite ductal
dilatation and no stones in hepatic or CBD.  Her Azathioprine
was held since admission.  Her WBC dropped to 1.5 but returned
to 3.5 the following day and has remained stable.  She was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for surgical evaluation regarding possible
cholecystectomy and unknown source of bacteremia.
  Upon admission, pt denies abd pain, biliary colic, dysuria,
urinary frequency, SOB, or cough.  She reports having had mild
chills several days earlier but it went away and she had been
feeling well.  She denies any sick contacts or eating anything
unusual.  Currently she feels well without complaints.  She ate
a [**Country 1073**] [**Location (un) 6002**] without any resulting abdominal pain.

Brief Hospital Course:
1. Recurrent Anaerobic Bacteremia: Over her total
hospitalization, Ms. [**Known lastname 60582**] failed a course of Cipro and a
course of Zosyn.  Her cultures showed intermittently E.coli, B
frag and clostridium, and VRE.  She was continued on Zosyn
throughout to cover for Gram Negatives and was also placed on
daptomycin 300mg IV daily.  After many studies, a GI source was
finally identified as her sigmoid diverticuli with
microperforation.  Surveillance daily blood cultures were drawn
and have been negative since [**2132-6-9**].  As the pt is not a
surgical candidate given her very poor liver function, she will
be discharged on antibiotics indefinitely to treat for what will
likely be continued recurrent seeding of her blood with GI
bacteria.  She also tested positive for Strongyloides antibodies
and was treated with two days of ivermectin.  On [**6-14**] the pt
spiked a fever to 101 and fluconazole was added to regimen.  She
never grew fungals in any of her blood cultures, and after about
one week of fluconazole her AST began to rise, so fluconazole
was changed to ambisome.  On day 3 of ambisome the pt developed
a drug rash and antifungal therapy was discontinued. [**6-26**]
Fluconazole was restarted. [**6-28**] Zosyn was d/c'ed and replaced w/
Levaquin and Flagyl, for concern of drug rash as well as
possible bone marrow suppression. A PICC line was placed and the
pt was d/c'ed on Daptomycin IV, and Levaquin, Flagyl, and
Fluconazole po.  She will follow up with infectious diseases,
Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 724**], as an outpatient.

2. Diarrhea: The pt had diarrhea at the beginning of her
hospital stay, which eventually resolved, and then recurred.
Stool cultures x 3 were negative for C. diff toxin. The most
likely etiology for recurrent diarrhea was simple
antibiotic-associated diarrhea, and cipro, zosyn, and daptomycin
could all be implicated. After three weeks in the hospital, the
pt's diarrhea was improved, with infrequent formed stools only.


3. Fever: The pt intermittently had fever and chills during her
hospitalization likely associated with new bacterial seeding of
the blood.

4. Rash: On [**6-11**] the pt developed an itchy, pink maculopapular
spotty rash over her entire back and a small amount
periumbilically.  This was felt to be a drug rash and
dermatology was consulted.  Most likely etiology is allergy to
daptomycin (rash on day 4) or Zosyn (rash on day 12). Temporally
either was possible. Although it started after initiating
daptomycin, this drug is also less likely to give rash.  As the
patient was thrombocytopenic, the ID team did not wish to change
her datomycin to linezolid, which has a high risk of
pancytopenia.  We decided to treat through her drug rash, as it
did not seem severe and decreased over her 3 days in the
hospital and appeared to resolve on [**6-14**].  The pt was written
for Atarax qhs.  After one week without the rash, the atarax was
discontinued.  After three days, when ambisome had been started
and atarax had been discontinued, the pt developed another drug
rash, this time over her back, abdomen, and bilateral arms and
legs.  The pt was restarted on Atarax qhs, given hydrocortisone
cream, and antifungal therapy was stopped, although fluconazole
was eventually restarted.

5. Autoimmune hepatitis/cirrhosis: the pt was follwed by the
liver team at [**Hospital1 18**]. Her azathioprine and aldactone were held
during her entire admission.  She is on the transplant list at
this time. She will follow up with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 497**].

6. Anemia: pt remained at her stable basel
