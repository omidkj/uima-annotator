Chief Complaint:
Gastrointestinal Bleeding

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
EGD with esphageal variceal injection and sclerosis

History of Present Illness:
84 y/o M with hx of CAD, s/p CABG, pacemaker, osteomyelitis and
recent hx of several weeks of GI bleeding presents with large
melanotic stool prior to presentation at [**Hospital1 **] today. He has
been having a few weeks of intermittent rectal bleeding, mostly
melanotic stools. He was evaluted with a colonoscopy and EGD
that were negative during an admission at [**Hospital1 **]. He has a hx of
one transfusion during that workup. As an outpatient here, he
then had a capsule study showing coffee ground in the stomach,
duodenal ulcers, and two jejunal polyps.
.
He was in his usual state of health, feeling well, maybe eating
less than normal, when early this morning he had a large loose,
bloody bowel movement. He had no chest pain, shorntess of
breath, dizziness, fainting, abdominal pain. No nausea or
vomiting. After this BM, he went directly to [**Hospital1 **]. There he
had an initial hct of 25, from 30 mid [**Month (only) 404**]. A repeat hct was
23. He was given IVFs but no blood transfusions. He had a RBC
tagged scan showing active bleeding in the stomach. There were
no ICU beds available there, so he was transferred here.
.
In the ED here, his initial vitals were 98.6 76 167/75 20 100%.
He had a NGL that showed bright red blood that cleared after 500
cc fluid. A rectal exam showed guiac positive stool and dried
blood around the anus. His repeat hct was 26. He remained
hemodynamically stable throughout his stay. He was started on a
protonix gtt. He was ordered for 2 u PRBCs and 1 [**Location 88101**]. He
received neither of them by the time of transfer.
.
Of note, he still feels well. No dizziness, abdominal pain. He
has had no more bowel movements from this morning. He is feeling
hungry. He notes that he was on coumadin for about a year but
was having bloody noses, so it was stopped about a month ago. He
does not drink etoh, take motrin or NSAIDs, and is not on
aspirin.

EGD REPORT [**2192-2-9**]
Impression: Varices at the middle third of the esophagus and
lower third of the esophagus
2 varices with recent stigmata of bleeding were found. First
lesion was at 12 o'clock (as shown in picture). Second lesion
was at 5 o'clock at lower esophagus. Both lesions were injected
with mix of dermabond/lipiodol with good hemastasis and evidence
of sclerosis. The lesion at 5 o'clock was also injected distal
to the varix within the same variceal cord.

Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum

U/S abd:
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of ascites.
2. Patent portal venous system with appropriate directionality
of flow.
3. Echogenic liver, suggestive of steatosis. Other forms of
hepatic disease,
such as cirrhosis or fibrosis are not excluded.
4. Right hepatic hypodensity as described above. This is
nonspecific,
possibly an area of focal fatty sparing, though a nodule in that
location is
not excluded. See below for recommendations.
4. Splenomegaly.
5. Large, 7 cm complex cyst arising from the upper pole of the
left kidney.
For this finding as well as for the nodule described in the
liver, would first
recommend comparison to prior imaging if available and, failing
that, these
could be further evaluated via MRI.


Brief Hospital Course:
This is an 84 y/o male with hx of CAD, s/p CABG, pacemaker,
osteomyelitis and recent hx of several weeks of GI bleeding
(painless melanotic stools) who was transferred from [**Hospital1 **] on [**2192-2-8**] after tagged RBC scan showed active bleeding
in the stomach. Colonoscopy and EGD on prior admission to [**Hospital1 **]
were negative. Capsule endoscopy at [**Hospital1 18**] in [**2191-10-24**] showed
coffee grounds in the stomach, a duodenal ulcer, and jejunal
polyps. On presentation to [**Hospital1 **], the patient's HCT was 25,
down from 30 in mid [**Month (only) 404**]. HCT was 23 on transfer.
.
Brief Hospital Course by Problem:
.
# GI bleed: Initial vitals in the ED were 98.6 76 167/75 20 100%
RA. He had a NGL that showed bright red blood that cleared after
500 cc fluid. A rectal exam showed guiac positive stool. Repeat
HCT was 26. He received 2 units pRBC and was started on PPI gtt.
He remained hemodynamically stable. Push enteroscopy showed
large esophageal varices in the endoscopy suite. The patient was
intubated in the MICU for repeat therapeutic EGD during which
the varices were injected and sclerosed, but could not be
banded. On transfer to the floor, the patient was no longer
having bloody bowel movements. He remained hemodynamically
stable with stable hct. Per the hepatology service, the patient
was on ocreotide gtt for 3 days, sucralfate qid, ciprofloxacin
for 5-7 days, and protonix qd for 4 weeks. Given that the
patient had no known history of cirrhosis or alcohol abuse with
negative hepatitis serologies, hepatology workup was undertaken.
RUQ ultrasound showed He is to have a gastrograffin swallow
study in 3 weeks and follow-up with the liver service in 4
weeks.
.
#. Liver and Renal Lesions:  On abdominal ultrasound showed
right hepatic hypodensity is nonspecific, a nodule in that
location can not be excluded.  There was also a large 7cm
complex cyst in the upper pole of the left kidney.  It is
recommended that a MRI be performed for further evaluation or
comparison to prior imaging if available.  The patient was
instructed
