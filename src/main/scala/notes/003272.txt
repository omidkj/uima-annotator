CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Respiratory distress

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 47-year-old
female with human immunodeficiency virus with a CD4 nadir of
150 and a CD4 count of 443 and a viral load of less than 50
in [**2189-9-17**], as well as history of intravenous drug
use, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and bipolar
disorder who presented on [**10-13**] to an outside
hospital with several weeks of cough, was treated for primary
care physician without response and transferred to [**Hospital6 1760**] for further evaluation and
treatment.

The patient had presented with several weeks of increased
cough, green sputum, low grade fever, low back pain,
weakness, bilateral hand swelling and non bloody diarrhea.
The patient had bilateral crackles on exam at the outside
hospital with a white blood cell count of 10.5.  The patient
was treated for Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, despite
having a CD4 count greater than 200 and being on Bactrim
prophylaxis.  The patient's course was complicated by acute
renal failure, thought to be secondary to a combination of
ACE inhibitor and NSAIDS.

The patient was treated with Bactrim, prednisone, intravenous
fluids and Levaquin.  A CT scan was done at the outside
hospital which revealed severe diffuse bilateral fibrosis
with honeycombing, no lymphadenopathy and no effusion.
Echocardiogram was performed which revealed ejection fraction
of 45% to 50%, concentric left ventricular hypertrophy by
atrial enlargement and pulmonary artery pressures in the 50s.
Cocaine was positive on the admission toxicology screen.  The
patient was bronchoscoped in early [**Month (only) 956**] at the outside
hospital revealing rare white blood cells and rare gram
positive cocci with negative stains for fungi acid fast
bacteria and PCP.  [**Name10 (NameIs) 3754**] was concern for cocaine associated
BOOP.  The patient also ruled in for a non Q-wave myocardial
infarction.  Her course was complicated by atrial
fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.  Over the
course of the few days prior to transfer, the patient
developed increasing O2 requirement and was intubated.  She
was finally transferred to [**Hospital6 2018**].

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Human immunodeficiency virus complicated by cryptococcal
meningitis, spinal abscess, thrush, [**Female First Name (un) 564**] esophagitis.  The
patient had most recent labs in [**2189-9-17**] with a viral
load of less than 50 and a CD4 count of 443.

3.  Cervical cancer, status post total abdominal
hysterectomy/bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy
4.  Recurrent pneumonia
5.  Gastroesophageal reflux disease
6.  Hypertension

ALLERGIES:  PENICILLIN

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient works as a community health
educator.  She lives alone.  She has one daughter.  Mother
lives in the area.  The patient smoked one pack per day for
17 years.  The patient has a history of alcohol and
polysubstance abuse.  The patient uses heroin and cocaine.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Breast cancer, congestive heart failure,
father with history of pulmonary fibrosis.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
VITAL SIGNS:  The patient had a blood pressure of 90/44,
pulse of 51 and oxygen saturation of 95%.  The patient was on
ventilatory support with pressure support of 20, PEEP of 5
and FIO2 of 100%.  The patient had a respiratory rate of 20.
GENERAL:  The patient was intubated, sedated and in no
apparent distress.
HEAD, EARS, EYES, NOSE AND THROAT:  Pupils equal, round and
reactive to light.  Extraocular movements intact.  Oropharynx
clear.
NECK:  Supple with no lymphadenopathy.
CARDIOVASCULAR:  Regular bradycardia, normal S1, S2 and a 1/6
systolic murmur at the left lower sternal border and patient
had jugular venous distention to 8 cm.
PULMONARY:  Bilateral inspiratory rales.
ABDOMEN:  Belly that was soft, nontender and nondistended
with normal bowel sounds and no hepatosplenomegaly.
EXTREMITIES:  No edema.
NEUROLOGIC:  Withdrawal to pain, moving all four extremities
and 3+ deep tendon reflexes with downgoing plantar reflexes.
SKIN:  No rash.  There was presence of needle tracks on the
forearms.

IMAGING:  Chest x-ray revealed diffuse bilateral nodular
interstitial infiltrates.  Chest CT from the outside hospital
revealed diffuse bilateral interstitial infiltrates with
slightly geographic distribution, mild honeycombing.  These
were most prominent at the bases.

PERTINENT LABORATORY FINDINGS:  The patient had arterial
blood gases with a pH of 7.35, PCO2 of 35 and P02 of 110 on
100% FIO2.  The patient's white blood cell count was 7.9 with
a hematocrit of 3.4 and platelets of 132.  The patient's
sodium was 138 with a potassium of 5.2, chloride of 110,
bicarbonate of 20, BUN of 71, creatinine of 1.6 and glucose
of 94.  Albumin was 2.5.  Calcium 8.1, magnesium 2.1, CK 55
and troponin 4.6.  The patient had an LDH of 665.

SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  On [**12-31**], the patient
underwent open lung biopsy which revealed pathology
consistent with BOOP.  The patient was continued on
ventilatory support, given steroid therapy and nebulizer
treatments, as well as antibiotics.  The patient continued to
have atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.
The patient's course was complicated by thrombocytopenia and
anemia.  The patient was taken off heparin prophylaxis and
Zantac.  Low extremity ultrasounds were negative and a hit
antibody was negative.

On [**1-6**], electrophysiology was consulted and they
recommended starting the patient on a heparin infusion as
well as sotalol 80 mg po tid and Lopressor.  On the 21st, the
patient was found to have low grade DIC based on labs.  On
[**1-9**], the patient had a febrile episode with
hypotension.  The patient had atrial fibrillation with rapid
ventricular response and was cardioverted.  There was
question of ventilator associated pneumonia and the patient
was started on clindamycin.

On [**1-14**], the patient was gradually weaned to
pressure support ventilation.  Steroids and sedation were
gradually weaned.  On the [**12-22**], the patient underwent
PEG placement and tracheostomy.  She experienced marked
agitation which was thought to be secondary to withdrawal
from tapering of the patient's sedation.  The patient's
sedation was tapered more slowly and a head CT was done which
revealed no signs of intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect.
The patient's mental status gradually improved.  The patient
was eventually weaned off of mechanical ventilation and
converted to trach mask.  Neurology was contact[**Name (NI) **] regarding
the patient's mental status and they felt that the picture
was most consistent with benzodiazepine withdrawal.
Infectious disease was also contact[**Name (NI) **] in order to facilitate
on the patient's human immunodeficiency virus care, as she
moved to the outpatient setting.  The patient was continued
on Bactrim with fluconazole.  The patient had daily QTCs
monitored secondary to occasional administration of Haldol
with the patient being on sotalol.

Case management and social work followed the patient in
hospital.  The patient had culture results with no growth at
the time of this dictation.  Vitamin B12, TSH and cortisol
were normal during the hospitalization.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Stable

The remainder of this dictation will be dictated as the
[**Hospital 228**] hospital course continues.
