.
In the ED, his initial vitals were T 99.4 BP 82/54 AR 132 RR 16
O2 sat 97% RA. Labs notable for leukocytosis and bandemia, nl

RUQ U/S - Gallbladder wall edema/thickening in a distended
gallbladder, without evidence of stones or son[**Name (NI) 493**] [**Name (NI) **]
sign. Wall edema/thickening is most likely secondary to
third-spacing of fluid; however, acute cholecystitis could have
a similar appearance in the appropriate clinical setting.
Nuclear medicine gallbladder scan can be performed for further
evaluation.
.
CT abdomen - 1. Marked mesenteric lymphadenopathy, with lymph
nodes measuring up to 13 mm. Major diagnostic considerations
would include lymphoma, however, the patient has reportedly
previously undergone lymph node biopsy which [**Last Name (un) 19692**] negative for
malignancy (all per surgery). Exact results are unknown. Other
diagnostic considerations include Castleman's disease, HIV,
connective tissue disorders, and mononucleosis, among many other
disorders. Correlation with previously acquired test results
would be helpful.
2. Incomplete identification of the appendix due to extensive
lymphadenopathy, with free fluid in the right lower quadrant at
the cecum and within the pelvis . Early and/or tip appendicitis
cannot be excluded on the basis of this examination.
3. No pulmonary embolism or acute aortic pathology.
4. Post-splenectomy.
5. Chronic loss of vertebral body height of T7, 8, and 9.
.
CXR - No acute cardiopulmonary process.
.
ECHO - The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial septal
defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. The estimated right
atrial pressure is 10-20mmHg. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
and cavity size are normal. Regional left ventricular wall
motion is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
low normal (LVEF 50-55%). There is no ventricular septal defect.
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with normal free
wall contractility. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic
regurgitation. No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic
valve. There is no aortic valve stenosis. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. No masses or vegetations
are seen on the tricuspid valve, but cannot be fully excluded
due to suboptimal image quality. There is mild pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: No valvular vegetations seen.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 6174**] is a 41yo male with PMH notable for ITP s/p
splenectomy presented with with fevers and abdominal pain,
initially in septic shock and requiring pressors with blood
cultures positive for streptococcus pneumonia, treated with
antibiotics, dexamenthasone, and IVIG, with prompt resolution of
unstable hemodynamics, with further uncomplicated hospital
course.
.
1.  Sepsis - patient presented with fevers, tachycardia,
hypotension, elevated lactate, marked leukocytosis with
bandemia, with eventual pneumococcal positive cultures.
Abd/pelvis CT showed no acute pathology, with exception of
diffuse LAD.  Lumbar puncture, urine, and chest xray were all
negative for signs of infection.  Patient's systolic blood
pressures were initially 80, prompting aggressive IVF and
levophed, and as per the recommendation of patient's oncologist,
IVIG and dexamethasone.  Antibiotic regimen initially was
vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and flagyl, with change to ceftriaxone
upon culture return, with outpatient plan for levofloxacin by
mouth to complete 14-day course.
.
2. Abdominal pain - patient initially presented with
mid-epigastric pain along the level of the umbilicus.  CT scan,
as above,
