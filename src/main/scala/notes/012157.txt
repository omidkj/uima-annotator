Images: CT A/P [**2172-8-27**] - 1. Moderate dilation of the common
bile duct with mild central intrahepatic biliary dilation with
an apparent filling defect in the distal CBD at the level of the
ampulla, likely a stone. Just proximal to this filling defect,
the distal CBD appears to narrow, and there is mild biliary wall
enhancement, likely due to inflammation. Recommend further
evaluation with MRCP/[**Year (4 digits) **].
2. Hypodense lesions within the right kidney are incompletely
evaluated. If MRCP is done, these can be evaluated at that time,
otherwise recommend ultrasound evaluation on a nonurgent basis.

3. Diverticulosis, with no evidence of diverticulitis.
4. Cholelithiasis.
.
EKG: NSR 90, NA/NI, poor r wave progression, no ST changes or
TWI
