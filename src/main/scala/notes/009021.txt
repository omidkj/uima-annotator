78yo M w/ COPD on 1L O2 requirement at home, CKD and HTN, being
transferred from MICU after being admitted for shortness of
breath, cough and weakness. The pt reports that the cough
started 2 months prior, initially productive of purulent,
non-bloody sputum. He was seen by his PCP and pulmonologist (Dr.
[**First Name (STitle) 5656**], and was given antibiotics and prednisone. The patient
reports feeling somewhat improved on them (down to 30mg
prednisone daily), until last week when the cough worsened, he
developed shortness of breath and felt weak.

In the ED he was found to be tachycardic to 150 with an
irregular rhythm, an RR of 36 with 94%NRB, and WBC of 20.1. He
was given abx in the ED, as well as solumedrol, combivent,
amiodarone (question of new onset a fib) and heparin. He was
stabilized after two days in the ICU, where he was transitioned
to oral diltiazem and started on a prednisone taper. He is being
admitted to the floor at his baseline 1L 02.
.
ROS: Positive for swollen feet bilaterally, which he says is new
for him. He denies any recent fevers, chills, nausea, vomiting,
diarrhea, constipation, headaches, dysuria or parasthesias.

Chest CXR [**5-23**]:
FINDINGS: As compared to the previous examination, there is no
relevant
change. On today's image, the basal parts of the lung parenchyma
are not
included. Unchanged borderline size of the cardiac silhouette
without
evidence of pulmonary edema. Absence of focal parenchymal
opacities
suggesting pneumonia. Absence of interstitial lung
abnormalities, absence of
pulmonary edema.
.
No radiographic evidence of overinflation.
.
Echo [**2181-5-21**]
The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. Left
ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global systolic
function are normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size
and free wall motion are normal. The right ventricular free wall
is hypertrophied. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. There is mild
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a small
pericardial effusion. There is an anterior space which most
likely represents a prominent fat pad. There are no
echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
.
Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable
for review) of [**2178-3-24**], the size of the pericardial effusion is
probably slightly smaller. The other findings are similar.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 496**] was admitted from the ED to the ICU for close
observation. On hospital day 4 he was transferred to the
inpatient floor in stable condition.
.
#COPD exacerbation: Pt with suspected respiratory infection as
cause of COPD infection.  Refractory to ourpatient antibiotic
and steroid treatment. Given Vanco for Gram Pos, Cefepime for
gram neg, Levofloxacin for atypicals. Given advair, albuterol
nebs prn, ipatropium nebs standing q5, solumedrol 125 pulse
followed by prednisone 60 mg po qD and tapered down. Pt's SOB
improved and pt weaned to 1L NC, which is his home dose, and he
was transferred from the ICU to the floor. Echo was done
inpatient to assess respiratory status which showed RVH, EF>55%,
some pulmonary HTN, likely from his COPD.
.
On the floor he was stable, with decreased coughing and
breathing normally on his baseline 1L O2. His pulmonary exam was
remarkable for initial wheezing in the upper lung fields and
coarse crackles in the lung bases. He received 40mg PO
prednisone x 2 days, with plan to taper to 20mg x 3 days before
stopping. At the time of discharge there was no wheezing. He was
discharged with a prescription for 5d of 750mg levofloxacin,
with concern for possible PNA as a trigger for his COPD
exacerbation.
.
#A. Fib: found to be in A. fib with RVR in ED. Was started on
amiodarone drip with no improvement. Rate control achieved with
diltiazem drip then changed to diltiazem 90 mg po and metoprolol
25 mg po BID.  He met CHADS criteria (score=3) for requiring
anticoagulation and was started on heparin drip then on coumadin
5 mg po qD.
.
On the floor he was found to be in sinus rhythm on the diltiazem
and metoprolol. Telemetry over the course of two days revealed
no afib. On [**5-24**] his INR reached 2.1 (therapeutic [**12-27**]), and he
was taken off the heparin. He was discharged with a prescription
for 360mg diltiazem XL QD. He will follow up with his primary
care physician in four days, and will also have visiting nurse
assistance for a cardiopulmonary evaluation, weight checks and
medication reconciliation.
