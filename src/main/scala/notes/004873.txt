patient's neck was soft and supple with no masses noted.
Chest was clear to auscultation with some minimal crackles
bilaterally at the bases.  Heart was regular rate and rhythm
with normal S1 and S2 with Grade II/VI systolic ejection
murmur at the left upper sternal border.  The abdomen was
soft, moderately tender to palpation, nondistended, positive

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient is a 67-year-old male with
multiple medical problems who presented with abdominal pain.
The patient was admitted to the Medical Service.  Abdominal
computerized tomography scan was obtained which showed some
ascites, a small amount of free fluid at the liver as well as
around the kidneys, otherwise unremarkable with no wall
thickening and normal appendix and normal sigmoid colon and no
free fluid in the pelvis.

On [**2131-2-12**], General Surgery was consulted.  Surgical
assessment included evaluation of belly revealing minimally
tender examination, guaiac negative.  Computerized tomography
scan repeated on [**2131-2-12**], revealing question of portal
venous gas.  Differential diagnosis included possible ischemic
colitis.  At this time a nasogastric tube was placed, serial
lactates were checked, and serial abdominal examinations were
performed.  The patient was discussed and seen by Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 5182**].  The patient was seen later on in the day by Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 5182**] personally and the patient's abdominal pain and
tenderness were worsening.  The decision was made at this time
to take the patient to the Operating Room for exploratory
laparotomy.

On [**2131-2-12**], the patient was taken to the Operating Room
for subtotal colectomy and diverting ileostomy for an ischemic
colitis.  For a more detailed account, please see the
operative report.  Postoperatively the patient was transferred
to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit.  Postoperatively the
patient did well in the unit.  The patient was extubated on
postoperative day #0.  The patient continued to be assessed
and monitored in the Surgical Intensive Care Unit.  Vascular
Surgery saw the patient on [**2131-2-17**] for question of
graft failure and increasing lower extremity ulcers.  However,
the patient was abstaining from surgical intervention at this
time.  The patient continued to be diuresed in the Intensive
Care Unit and tube feeds were continued.  On [**2131-2-19**],
the patient had pulse volume recordings which showed a patent
left graft with low velocities distally with no definite
stenosis identified.  The patient had some leakage around his
gastrostomy tube on [**2131-2-20**].  Tube check and
replacement revealed satisfactory placement of silastic
gastrojejunostomy tube.  The patient was revealed to have
gastric outlet obstruction at this time and the patient was
limited to clears with p.o. intake with tube feeds to continue
at goal which was 95 cc/hr for 24 hours or 120 cc/hr cycled
over 18.  The patient was evaluated for rehabilitation
placement, however, the patient as well as family had been

improving chest x-ray, however, with a persistent left-sided
pleural effusion.  On [**2131-2-24**], the patient was noted to
have an elevated white count of 23.  Due to the persistent
wishes of the patient to be discharged to home, the patient

q. day for a presumed pneumonia.  Sputum culture, urine
culture and ileostomy was taken for Clostridium difficile and

physicians to monitor culture data.
