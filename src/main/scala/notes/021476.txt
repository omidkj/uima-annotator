Allergies:
Cephalexin / Erythromycin Base

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 30**]
Chief Complaint:
Cellulitis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation

History of Present Illness:
69-year-old female with past medical history significant for
asthma, CAD, CHF, IDDM, CKD who presents with bilateral lower
extremity cellulitis and respiratory distress requiring
intubation.
.
Per reports, the patient was in her usual state of health until
4 weeks prior to admission. At that time she developed a
cellulitis and was treated by PCP with oral antibiotics for 4
weeks without improvment. The patient endorses significant pain
(L leg greater than R), rash, shortness of breath and a dry
cough. She presented to her PCP who referred her to [**Hospital1 18**] for IV
antibiotics.
.
Upon arrival to EW, initial vitals were: T 97.2, BP 134/80, HR
62, RR 18, SaO2 96% RA, blood sugar 127mg/dl. She was AOx3. She
was placed on 3L NC for unclear reasons ([**Name (NI) **] 96%). Later the
patient became tachypneic and tachycadic. She was placed on a
nonrebreather (SaO2 99%) with increasing tachycadia. ABG showed
7.3/48/474/25/-2. She was intubated with etomidate and succinate
and propofol for sedation. She was given morphine, vancomycin,
benadryl, levofloxacin, heparin sc, solumedrol, heparin gtt for
subtherapeutic INR. The patient was admitted to MICU green.
.
Upon arrival to MICU green, initial vitals were T 100.2, HR 87,
BP 112/55, RR 20, 100% Intubated FiO2 .40. The patient is
sedated and no apparent distress.

11/5 blood culture x 2: negative
[**12-2**] urine culture: negative
.
[**12-6**] TTE:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric
left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed with
global hypokinesis (LVEF= [**11-10**] %). The inferior wall may be
more severely hypokinetic. The right ventricular cavity is
dilated with severely depressed free wall contractility. The
aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened (?#). Mild aortic
stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. There is no mitral
valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to
acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may be
significantly UNDERestimated.] The left ventricular inflow
pattern suggests a restrictive filling abnormality, with
elevated left atrial pressure. The tricuspid valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Significant pulmonic regurgitation is seen. The end-diastolic
pulmonic regurgitation velocity is increased suggesting
pulmonary artery diastolic hypertension. The main pulmonary
artery is dilated. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial
effusion.

IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Mild left ventricular
hypertrophy with severe biventricular systolic dysfunction.
Dilated right ventricle. Severe pulmonary hypertension. Moderate
tricuspid regurgitation. Mild aortic stenosis. Mild mitral
regurgitation.
.
[**12-8**] CXR:
FRONTAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH: A right-sided PICC line is now
appropriately
positioned with tip overlying the cavoatrial junction. The
cardiomediastinal
silhouette is stable. There is no focal consolidation or
pneumothorax. There
is slight blunting of the right costophrenic angle.

The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

.
[**12-5**] ABIs:
IMPRESSION: Bilateral aortoiliac occlusive disease and possible
additional
infrainguinal disease.
.
Wound care recs:
Recommendations: Pressure relief per pressure ulcer guidelines
Support surface--Atmos Air.
Turn and reposition every 1-2 hours and prn
Heels off bed surface at all times
Waffle Boots to B/L LE's: order size large.
If OOB, limit sit time to one hour at a time and sit on a
pressure relief cushion--Gaymar waffle cushion.
Elevate LE's while sitting.
Moisturize peri wound skin to B/L LE's and feet [**Hospital1 **] with Aloe
Vesta moisture barrier ointment.

Bilateral LE ulcers: Commercial wound cleanser cleanse all open
wounds.Pat the tissue dry with dry gauze.
Apply Xeroform gauze to provide moist wound healing environment,
nontraumatic DSG removal, and decrease local bacteria bio
burden.
Cover with large softsorb sponge and secure with Kerlix wrap.
Change daily.
Per Vascular Surgery: Please also keep wrapped with Ace bandage
and keep elevated.

L thigh wound: keep clean. Monitor for changes. Leave open to
air.
.
[**12-2**] LENIs:
Enlarged cardiac silhouette and widened mediastinum are
unchanged from the day
before. There is minimal increase in biapical atelectasis;
otherwise, the
lungs are clear. There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
.
[**12-1**] EKG:
Baseline artifact. Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular
response.
Diffuse non-specific ST-T wave changes may be due to
repolarization
abnormality. However, cannot exclude ischemia. No previous
tracing available
for comparison.


Brief Hospital Course:
69-year-old female with past medical history significant for
asthma, CAD s/p CABG, CHF, IDDM, CKD who presents with bilateral
lower extremity cellulitis and respiratory distress requiring
intubation.
.
# Cellulitis: On presentation, the patient had a very severe
excoriated rash on bilateral lower extremities. There was
concern for cellulitis in the context of bad venous stasis and
history of treatment failure on PO doxycycline and bactrim x 4
weeks as an outpatient. The patient completed 10 days of
Vancomycin. Wound care and vascular surgery were consulted.
Wound care recommendations were strictly followed - including
wrapping and elevating the legs, and changing the wound
dressings daily. ABIs showed aorto-iliac disease, however the
patient had doppler-able pulses. Vascular surgery recommended no
interventions, but agreed with wound care recs. The patient was
discharged with home VNA for wound care support.
.
# Respiratory failure: On presentation to the ED, the patient
appeared to have hypercar
