History of Present Illness:
Pt. was in USOH until 6.30pm on the night prior to admission,
when he felt generally fatigeud and ill.  He noted to have had a
low grade fever and took a nap.  At 8.30, his wife heard
grunting noises from bedroom, as she arrived, she noted that he
could not get OOB despite attempts.  He was able to answer some
of her questions, but was "confused" some of his words were part
of normal volcabulary, but did not make sense situationally.
After ~ 20 mins, he was eventually able to get OOB and walk to
kitchen.  He was able to drink a glass of water, however wife
noted that he continued to not be himself (he did not know how
to check his BG which he does regularly).   She then noted again
that he appeared weak (stumbling in the room, from side to
side).  She helped him to a chair, where he was unable to
support himself and slumped down.  He was able to respond to
her, however, again was felt to be confused.  There was no
aphasia, he did not have anomia, his words were no "gibberish"
but simply did not make sense in the context.  He did not have
any premontory sx, no auras, no shaking, no incontinence, no
tongue biting. No prior episodes like this before.  No HA, no
neck stiffness, phono/photophobia.  No recent travel, no
exposures.

Patient was noted to have a WBC given 16K, INR 2.3, Cr 1.8 and
Troponin of 0.02.  He underwent CXR and CT head that were
negative for infection and ICH respectively.  He was found to

80s. He received 4L NS, 1g of tylenol, Vancomycin 1g,
CeftriaXONE 1g, Aspirin 325mg,  and Neutra-Phos Powder Packet 1.
.

Brief Hospital Course:
# Metabolic encephalopathy:  Etiology unclear.  Initial concern
was for embolic event vs. Seizure activity vs Menengitis.  He
had a LP on [**9-26**] that was clear fluid and cell count/prelim gram
stain which was negative for menengitis.  He also underwent an
EEG on [**9-26**] and results are pending as of [**9-27**].   Embolic event
secondary to A. fib was less likely given therapeutic INR (2.3).
Throughout the day on [**9-26**] pt's mental status improved and he
was lucid, A/O x3 and interactive by time of transfer to the
floor.

.
# Sepsis syndrome. Source of leukocytosis and fever unclear.
[**Name2 (NI) **] with septic physiology in the ED, but responded to IVF.
He did not require pressors.  UA neg, CXR w/o focal infiltrate,
and LP did not show menengitis.  He was initially started on
emperic treatment for menengitis (CTX 1g [**Hospital1 **] and Vanc) and
azithro for possible CAP on [**9-26**].  After LP came back negative,
CTX was changed to 1g daily for pna coverage, azithro was
continued, and vanc was d/c'd on [**9-27**].  LFTs were unremarkable,
and Bcx is pending from [**9-25**].  WBC trended down throughout [**Hospital Unit Name 153**]
stay as did his fevers.

# Hypotension.  Likely due to septic physiology.  Received 4 L
of IVF in the ED and pressures were stable throughout [**Hospital Unit Name 153**]
course.   EKG w/o ischemic signs/changes, and troponin trended
down from 0.02 to 0.01.  Also had elevated lactate of 1.9 on
[**9-25**] which actually increased to 2.3 on [**9-26**] but clinically
remained stable and no clinical concern for hypoperfusion.
.
# Volume overload by CXR and lung exam on [**9-27**], likely [**2-1**] to
IVF.  (+6L over last 24 hr in [**Hospital Unit Name 153**]).  We diuresed him to a goal
of -1-2L on [**8-27**].  Resp status remained stable on NC.
.
# Hypoxemic resp. distress. Likely due to volume overload as
above and possible PNA (treated for CAP, given clinical criteria
w/o CXR changes).  Continued CAP tx (ctx and azithro) and
diuresis with a goal of negative 1-2 L/day with good response.
He did have some desats into the low 90s on 5L NC on the morning
of [**9-28**], but by transfer to floor, satting mid 90s on 4-5L NC.
.
# Renal failure. Cr elevated at 1.9 but was stable and this is
his baseline per PCP.  [**Name10 (NameIs) **] held lisinopril.
.
# Atrial flutter/fibrillation. Rate controlled.  We restared his
digoxin on [**9-27**] and continued his coumadin after his LP, which
was increased to his home dose of 6mg daily on [**9-28**] after INR
became subtherpeutic. Remained in AF.
.
# DM. FS stable throughout admission on Lantus 14U AM and HISS
which pt. self regulates with carb counting
