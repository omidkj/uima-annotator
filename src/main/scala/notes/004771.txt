History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **] year-old man with a history of CVA, CKD, AV dissociation with
pacemaker presented with general malaise and shortness of breath
on [**2104-9-20**]. He has intermittently been lightheaded the 2 months
prior to admission. He reports occasional abdominal pain as
well. He is unable to report blood in urine or stool given that
he has macular degeneration.

In the ED, he was hypotensive with BP 80/60 and paced HR of 60.
He was admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**]. Central line was placed and patient
given 2 liters IV fluids. Stool was brown and guaiac positive.
IV PPI started and 2 units of PRBCs transfused and an additional
3 liters of IV fluids administered. Vanco and Zosyn given for
possible PNA which was subsequently changed to Levofloxacin to
treat CAP. HCT increased from 18 to 28 after the 2 unit PRBC
transfusion. Patient was noted to have [**Last Name (un) **]. ECG without ischemic
changes and troponins 0.04 to 0.05 with no rise in CK. He was on
Levophed briefly. Aggrenox has been held given the GI bleed.
Lisinopril and Atenolol have been held given his [**Last Name (un) **] and GI
bleed. EGD was performed and did not reveal a source of
bleeding. Patient then transferred to the floor.

Since receiving the blood transfusion, he reports that his
symptoms of shortness of breath and fatigue resolved. He
chronically has right arm pain since his stroke. At baseline, he
can walk around his house using the assist of a cane. Patient
relates that he has not really had much of an appetite recently.
He does not feel hungry nor thirsty.

Images:
[**2104-9-20**] AP CXR:
1. Bilateral calcified pleural plaques, suggesting prior
asbestos exposure.
2. Interval increase of bilateral interstitial markings, could
represent mild pulmonary edema or progression of the known
chronic lung disease. Slight increased haziness of right mid
lung, underlying consolidation can not be excluded.

[**2104-9-20**] CT ABD/PEL:
1. Evaluation suboptimal due to lack of IV contrast. Stable
infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm without findings to suggest
active rupture.
2. No free fluid within the abdomen or pelvis.
3. Severe emphysema and bilateral calcified pleural plaques seen
at the lung bases, unchanged. Mild septal thickening which may
reflect mild fluid overload.

[**2104-1-10**] TTE: Mild regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction, c/w multivessel CAD. Mild calcific aortic stenosis.
Mild pulmonary hypertension. LVEF = 40-45%

EKG: V-paced at a rate of 67 bpm. Normal intervals. J point
elevation V2-V5 that is slightly more prominent compared with
prior. ST changes not significantly different from prior.

EGD [**2104-9-22**]: Normal upper endoscopy with the exception of a
small hiatal hernia. No source of bleeding was identified.

EGD:
Impression: Normal upper endoscopy with the exception of a small
hiatal hernia.  No source of bleeding was identified

Colonoscopy:
Impression: Polyps in the ascending colon, descending colon and
sigmoid colon - Not removed.
Mild erythema and blurring of the normal vascular pattern were
noted in the distal descending colon and sigmoid. (biopsy)
Otherwise normal colonoscopy to cecum


Brief Hospital Course:
[**Age over 90 **] year-old man with a history of CVA, CKD, AV dissociation with
pacemaker presented with general malaise. He appears to have
been taking decreased PO intake recently given his lack of
appetite. Given that he has been on aggrenox, it is possible
this may have caused GI bleed. Also hypotension may have caused
mesenteric or colonic ischemia that may explain occassional
abdominal pain. Currently, hypotension and [**Last Name (un) **] have resolved
with IVF and blood transfusions which is consistent with
hypovolemia/pre-renal. EGD did not reveal a source of GI
bleeding. Colonoscopy did not reveal active bleeding, but since
it was days later, the site may have healed somewhat. He did
have biopsies taken.

# Shortness of breath resolved with blood transfusion, so
suspect that it was due to Anemia. Patient completed a course of
PO antibiotics, for empiric coverage of community acquired
pneumonia.  Urine legionella antigen negative.

# Anemia due to ischemic colitis vs blood loss from GI tract,
responded to 2 units PRBC. HCT 18-->28, and has remained stable
since. Iron studies suggestive of Chronic Disease rather than
Iron Deficiency. No evidence of hemolysis or B12/Folate
deficiency. EGD negative. Biopsies from colonscopy are pending,
and the colonoscopy was done after the [**Last Name (un) **] and hypotension had
stabilized.

# Hypotension resolved. [**12-25**] Dehydration vs blood loss. Not
likely sepsis, but does seem to have been potentiated by his
home BP agents. Have discontinued them, and he should not
restart them unless his blood pressure increases significantly.
Suspect his 29lb reported weight loss is the reason for him not
to need these medications further.  His BP did increase to the
130s prior to discharge, so his atenolol alone was restarted at
a lower dose of 25mg daily.

# [**Last Name (un) **] [**12-25**] hypotension, now resolved from Cr 2.8-->2.0 (baseline
Cr 1.7). Resolved, and would not restart medications for the
above reasons.  Lisiniopril was held

# Elevated Troponin likely secondary to acute kidney injury.
Stabilized.

# Gout: Held colchicine initially due to renal failure,
restarted when complained of gout on great toe, after several
days off the colchicine, and once his [**Last Name (un) **] had resolved.

# Hypertension: Holding felodipine, lisinopril, due to
hypotension.  Restarted atenolol at lower dose upon discharge.

# History of CVA, residual right-side motor weakness: No current
evidence for stroke. Hold aggrenox in setting of likely blood
loss anemia.

# Hyperlipide
