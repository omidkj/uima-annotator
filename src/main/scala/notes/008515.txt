History of Present Illness:
68 yo M with PMH of COPD, DM, CHF who presents with worsening
dyspnea. He reports that he was without his BIPAP at home for a
while. Per his wife, he has been more dyspnic over the past 2
weeks, has been unable to walk without becoming short of breath.
He normally slept with 2L NC oxygen but recently has been using
5L of oxygen all the time. He called Dr.[**Name (NI) 96732**] office and
was given a burst of prednisone 40mg for 5 days (today is day
4). Of note, he has not seen Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 58318**] for 2 years. Denies
fevers, chills, nausea, vomitting, chest pain. He reports he can
lie flat in bed without difficulty. His wife felt he was getting
worse and made him come to the ED today.

In the ED, his initial vitals were T 96.7, BP 154/86, HR 109, RR
17, initially 91% on RA but dropped to 83%. He was given nebs,
125mg IV Solumedrol, 40 IV Lasix.  BP was 231/98 and was started
on Nitro gtt and bipap 16/8 50% FiO2. His potassium was 6.2. He
was given albuterol and insulin and calcium. A CXR was a poor
study and given some concern for pneumonia, he was given
levofloxacin.

Currently, he says he feels much improved. Denies chest pain,
palpitations, nausea, vomiting. Does have shortness of breath
but improving. No myalgias, fevers or cough.

Blood and urine cx ([**10-6**]): negative

CXR ([**10-6**]):
1. Limited evaluation due to low lung volumes.
2. Probable mild pulmonary edema with small bilateral pleural
effusions,
right greater than left.
3. Bibasilar patchy opacities likely representing atelectasis;
however, developing infection cannot be excluded.
4. Unchanged deformity of the left chest wall and thoracic
scoliosis.

CXR ([**10-7**]):
Since yesterday, lung volumes are better. Pulmonary edema
improved. Left
basilar opacity cleared. Right pleural effusion decreased, now
small with
adjacent minimal basilar atelectasis. Chest wall deformity and
scoliosis are unchanged.

CXR ([**10-8**]):
Moderate right pleural effusion and pulmonary vascular
congestion, borderline cardiomegaly and mediastinal venous
engorgement all worsened since [**10-7**] after showing
previous improvement. Mediastinal contour raises possibility of
pulmonary hypertension. No pneumothorax. Rib asymmetry is
difficult to explain but there could be a supernumerary first or
second rib on the left.

TTE ([**10-10**]):
The left atrium is elongated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and global
systolic function (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical
quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully
excluded. Compared with the report of the prior study (images
unavailable for review) of [**2109-8-21**], the findings are similar.

Brief Hospital Course:
1) Asthma/COPD exacerbation: In the MICU, he was treated with
solumedrol 125mg IV q8 hours, standing and PRN nebs. He required
bipap for his first 24 hours of admission to maintain O2
saturation, and was weaned to face mask and then NC, with bipap
at night. He received 2 doses of IV lasix 40mg, with good
diuresis and apparent symptom improvement. However, he has no
prior dx of heart failure, BNP was minimally elevated and echo
was not consistent with acute heart failure. His steroids were
switched to a quick prednisone taper (60mg, 30mg, 10mg, off). O2
wean was attempted, but patient continued to require 2L by NC.
Since he was breathing comfortably and felt back to baseline, he
was discharged with instruction to use supplemental O2 to keep
sat over 90%. On the day of discharge, his lasix was decreased
from 40mg to 20mg po daily in the setting of hypochloremic
metabolic alkalosis.

2) Diabetes: He was placed on an aggressive insulin sliding
scale due to worsened hyperglycemia in the setting of steroid
use. For better control, he was also given glargine, which was
increased to 18 units hs. Until the steroid effects on his
hyperglycemia improved, patient was instructed to use a humalog
sliding scale, and his wife (a nurse) will help him administer
insulin.

3) Hyperkalemia: Was noted on admission, so his ACE-I was held.
No EKG changes. He was given insulin in the setting of his
hyperglycemia. He improved without other intervention, and
became mildly hypokalemic, which was repleted and his ACE-I was
restarted.

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] with difficulty breathing due to an
exacerbation of your chronic lung disease. You improved with
BiPAP, an extra dose of IV lasix, and a short course of
steroids. Please be sure to use your home oxygen to keep your
oxygen saturation over 90%. Also, continue your BiPAP every
night.

Please go to all follow up appointments and take all medications
as prescribed. We have lowered you lasix dose as it was causing
your chlor
