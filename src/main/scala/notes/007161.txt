Imaging/Studies:
[**9-20**] CXR
Cardiomegaly is severe, unchanged.  There is unchanged
appearance of the
pacemaker leads.  There is interval development of interstitial
pulmonary
edema.  More pronounced bibasal opacities might be concerning
for interval
development of infectious process.

[**9-21**] EKG: Sinus rhythm with biventricular pacing. Compared to
the previous tracing of [**2196-9-16**] pseudofusion beats are not seen
on the current tracing. Atrial tachycardia is not clearly seen
on the current tracing, although there is some baseline artifact
which makes interpretation difficult.

Cardiovascular Report Cardiac Cath Study Date of [**2196-9-22**]
BRIEF HISTORY:   63-year-old man with non-ischemic dilated
cardiomyopathy and biventricular failure with an EF less than
20% and
worsening symptoms over the past several months. He under went a
right
heart catheterization on [**2196-9-16**] with a cardiac index of 1.36.
He is now
admitted to the CCU on milrinone and a furosemide drip. He is
referred
to the cath lab for placement of a pulmonary artery catheter to
tailor
inotrope therapy.

INDICATIONS FOR CATHETERIZATION:
Congestive heart failure, dilated cardiomyopathy.

PROCEDURE:
Right heart catheterization via the right internal jugular vein
with a
8F sheath. Pulmonary artery catheter left in place after
procedure for
transfer back to the CCU.
Conscious Sedation:  was provided with appropriate monitoring
performed by
a member of the nursing staff.

COMMENTS:
1. Resting hemodynamics while on a milrinone drip showed
elevated
right-sided pressures. The RA pressure was elevated at 13 mmHg
and the
RV pressure was eleated at 41/14. The PA pressure was elevated
at 43/22
with a mean PA pressure of 29. The wedge pressure was elevated
at 22
mmHg.
2. Measurements of oxygen saturations revealed a low SVC and PA
oxygen
saturation of 61 and 68% respectively.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Hemodynamics improved on milrinone with a better cardiac
index.
2. Adjust CHF medications in CCU with pulmonary artery catheter
in
place.
