Brief Hospital Course:
#[**Month/Day/Year **] wound:
In the ED, [**Month/Day/Year **] surgery saw the patient, and felt that the
wound was not infected, and should be handled with general wound
care. On the floor, the wound drained copious amounts of serous
flluid. A wound consult was ordered. The wound care nurse
recommended a wound vac, however [**Month/Day/Year 1106**] surgery did not felt
this was pertinent at this time.
#ARF:
Upon admission, the patient was found to have a Cr=2.3 which is
above her basline. There was question of whether this ARF was
prerenal, or due to hepatorenal syndrome. The patient was also
found to have a metabolic acidosis, with a lactate of 4,
suggesting sepsis. The patient was given 2 L NS in the ED, and
was infused with HCO3- and NS while on the floor. Over the first
night of her admission, the patient received 1300cc and put out
100cc. On the second day of her admission, her lytes normalized
with Na going from 129 to 132 and Cr from 2.6-2.2 suggesting a
prerenal picture. Dialysis not started.

#Cirrhosis:
The patient presented with a small rise in her LFT's, and
ascites.  She had an abdominal US which showed patend venous
flow, and some ascites. She became encephalopathic. Due to
[**Hospital 7235**] medical problems, patient and family decided to stop
treatment and was made CMO. Pt was placed on fentanly gtt and
scopalamine patch and died within 48 hours.
