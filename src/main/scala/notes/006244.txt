Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2181**]
Chief Complaint:
Pneumonia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Thoracentesis


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 68645**] is a 66 yo M w/PMHx of Stage III metastatic NSCLC
([**7-/2184**]), sleep apnea, diabetes with nephropathy who was
transferred from an OSH for mental status changes and possible
PNA. He was found to have acute renal insufficiency with rise in
creatinine to 4.0 from baseline 1.5 ([**8-4**]).

Pt recently began chemotherapy under an experimental protocol.
After his first treatment, he was hospitalized for hypoxia [**12-22**]
malignant pleural effusion (per wife's report). After holding
Lovenox for thoracentesis on [**7-31**], he was noted to have swelling
of his LUE, so lovenox was restarted. He was also started on
Levofloxacin during this admission. He did have some confusion
and new changes in motor function during that stay, but CT head
was negative.

He was discharged to rehab 10 days prior to current admission.
At rehab facility he continued to have improved function. He
underwent the 2nd course of the experimental chemotherapy which
lasted 48h and completed on [**8-11**]. On [**8-12**], he received oxycontin
for pain (prior to this he had been receiving oxycodone). His
wife noted, that lethargy began on Saturday and acutely
progressed after receiving the 1st of 10 sessions of XRT on
Monday. The wife states that his last dose of oxycontin was the
day prior to admission jerking movements and staring episodes
are new. He developed a fever to 101 on day of admission. He was
also noted to be hypotensive to the systolics 90s-100s with HR
120s during his OSH ED stay. CXR at an OSH revealed multilobar
infiltrates. He was started on Ceftriaxone and Flagyl, then
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].

In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, the patient received one dose of Vancomycin and
NS. MS improved and pt transfered to floor. While getting CXR pt
noted to be more somnolent and briefly unresponsive to sternal
rub. ABG at this time was 7.26/69/76 on 4L NC. Found to be
hyperkalemic, NGT placement attempted to administer Kayexalate
but this was unsuccessful. Pt then responsive but continued to
be somnolent. BP stable in 100's and HR 102. O2sat stable at 96%
on 4L NC.

Given hypercarbia and possible need for BIPAP, he was admitted
to the MICU. He required BIPAP at night initially, but was soon
changed to NC. A pleural effusion was tapped on [**8-17**] and was
negative for malignant cells. His mental status, ARF and
hyperkalemia improved and he was called out to the floor, still
on 4liters NC.

CXR ([**2186-8-15**]):
1. Dense opacity identified in the right upper lung field likely
corresponding to patient's known lung cancer.
2. Diffuse airspace opacity within the right lung fields
represents atelectasis versus pneumonia. Please correlate
clinically as there are no prior radiographs available for
comparison.
3. Normal position of right PICC line.

CXR ([**2186-8-18**]):
1. Interval removal of fluid with slight improved aeration of
the right lung with persistent large opacity in the right mid
lung zone, which consists of tumor and atelectasis.
2. Persistent asymmetric pulmonary edema. See report of recent
CT for more details.

CT head ([**2186-8-15**]):
1. No evidence of acute intracranial process. Please note that
metastatic disease cannot be excluded by this non-contrast
study.
2. Stranding in the fat overlying the right upper neck, near the
skull base. Correlation with physical examination is
recommended.
Note added at attending review: I think the soft tissue
stranding is on the left.

CT head ([**2186-8-20**]):
No evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage or significant
change from the prior study.

Chest US ([**2186-8-16**]):
Moderate-sized right pleural effusion, the upper extent of which
cannot be visualized given lack of proper positioning. This
effusion appears amenable to ultrasound-guided thoracentesis and
can be performed with personnel from the referring team to
assist in positioning and monitoring patient.

Renal US ([**2186-8-16**]):
No evidence of obstruction.

CT Chest ([**2186-8-17**]):
1. Large right hilar mass with bronchial obstruction, extensive
mediastinal lymphadenopathy and axillary lymphadenopathy and
multiple left lung and possible thoracic vertebral metastases.
2. Bilateral pleural and small pericardial effusion. Possible
right pleural tumore implant.
3. Pericardial effusion.


Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 66 yo M w/PMHx sx metastatic lung cancer s/p chemotherapy,
recent hospital stay for pneumonia presents from rehab with
altered mental status and acute renal failure with rise in
creatinine from 1.0 to 4.0.

1. Pneumonia:
PNA on CXR, presumed post-obstructive. Started vanco/zosyn and
transitioned to augmentin on [**8-18**]. Patient afebrile since. New
leukocytosis to 12 on [**8-20**], but was been asymptomatic. Was on
bipap on admission but transitioned and on discharge was on room
air with a low to mid 90s saturation.  Ambulatory saturation in
the low 90s off O2.

Plan on discharge was for continuation of Augmentin (Day 1 =
[**8-15**]) for 14 total days.  He was to be discharged with immediate
follow-up (same day) at [**Company 2860**].

2. ARF:
Etiology of renal failure was likely multifactorial including IV
contrast from recent admission, continuation of nephrotoxic
medications including LMWH, losartan, and furosemide, as well as
recent antibiotics, including ceftriaxone and vancomycin. Renal
was consulted and suspected ATN given casts in urine and period
of hypotension. Renal US did
