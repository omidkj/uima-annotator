CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Abdominal aortic aneurysm.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 82-year-old female
with a known abdominal aortic aneurysm who has been monitored
by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1391**]. The patient is being admitted for elective
repair.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Type 2 diabetes diet controlled, lung
carcinoma status post radiation therapy, history of
hyperlipidemia, history of COPD by chest x-ray.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Tonsillectomy.

ALLERGIES:  No known allergies.

MEDICATIONS:  Include Lescol 80 mg daily and Advair 250 mg
twice a day.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient has a 67 pack year history of
smoking which is current. The patient does have a history of
alcohol use 1-2 drinks per day.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs: The patient is afebrile,
pulse is 80, respirations 16, oxygen saturation 94% in room
air. Blood pressure is 148/78. General appearance: An alert
white female in no acute distress, oriented x3. Heart:
Regular rate and rhythm without murmurs, rubs or gallops.
Lungs: Diminished breath sounds throughout but clear.
Abdomen: Soft, nontender with palpable prominent aorta.
Extremities: Without edema. There are palpable femorals
bilaterally and dopplerable pedal pulses bilaterally.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the vascular
service. She was prepared for surgery. She underwent on
[**2161-3-2**], an aorto-bifemoral bypass graft for
resection of abdominal aortic aneurysm. She received 300 cc
of cell [**Doctor Last Name 10105**] and 1 unit of packed cells. She tolerated the
procedure well and was transferred to the PACU in stable
condition. An epidural was placed intraoperatively for
analgesic control. Her vital signs, she was hemodynamically
stable in the recovery room. Her postoperative hematocrit was
26.8. She was transfused. BUN 15, creatinine 0.7. The patient
continued to do well and was transferred to the VICU for
continued monitoring and care. Postoperative day 1, there
were no overnight events. She did develop mild confusion and
agitation which progressed during the day. Her confusion
required Haldol but the agitation continued and she developed
a temperature with tachycardia. She was placed on a CIWA
scale and transferred to the ICU for continued monitoring and
care. Her PA pressures were elevated at this time and a chest
x-ray was consistent with congestive heart failure. She was
diuresed. It was also noted that platelet count had dropped
from 120,000 to 79,000 and a HIT panel was sent. While in the
unit, her urinary output improved with diuresis. Blood
cultures were sent for the temperature. The urine did grow E.
Coli which was treated with ciprofloxacin. She remained
afebrile. The patient's epidural was discontinued on
postoperative day 2. She was given pain medications IV along
with q.1 hour neurologic signs for her low platelet count
after removal of the epidural. She did continue to require
diuresis postoperative day 3. The NG tube was removed on
postoperative day 1. Sips were begun on postoperative day 3
and her diet was advanced as tolerated. She continued to
require Lasix and she was given 25 grams albumin for her
hypoalbuminemia. The patient continued to show improvement in
her congestive failure. She remained in the ICU. Her cardiac
enzymes remained unremarkable. Her PA line was converted to a
central line on postoperative day 4. Her heparin was
restarted secondary to the HIT being negative. Her wounds
looked clean, dry and intact. She had bowel sounds. She still
remained awake but mildly agitated. Her glycemic control was
excellent. The patient was transferred to the VICU for
continued monitoring and care. Ambulation was begun and
physical therapy was requested to evaluate the patient for
discharge planning. She did require an increase in her
metoprolol to maintain her heart rate less than 80. On
postoperative day 5, she continued to progress. Physical
therapy felt that she would benefit from rehabilitation. On
postoperative day 6, her central line was discontinued and a
peripheral line was placed. She was transferred to the floor.
She continued to be diuresed. Her hematocrit remained stable
at 28.3. The remaining hospital course was unremarkable. The
patient did have a bowel movement on postoperative day 7. She
would be transferred to rehabilitation when medically stable
when bed available.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Abdominal aortic aneurysm.

    x-ray.
3.  History of lung cancer, status post radiation therapy.
4.  History of hyperlipidemia.
5.  History of type 2 diabetes, diet controlled.
6.  History of smoking 67 pack years, current smoker.
7.  Postoperative confusion, resolved.
8.  Postoperative withdrawal, treated.
9.  Postoperative thrombocytopenia, HIT negative.
10. Postoperative blood loss anemia, transfused.
11. Postoperative acute renal failure, resolved.
12. Postoperative volume depletion, fluid resuscitated.
13. Postoperative congestive heart failure, diuresed.
14. Postoperative hypercarbia, resolved.
15. Postoperative urinary tract infection, treating for E.
    Coli.

MAJOR SURGICAL PROCEDURE:  Abdominal aortic aneurysm repair
with aorto-bifemoral bypass graft on [**2161-3-2**].

DISCHARGE DISPOSITION:  The patient may ambulate as tolerated
and slowly progress. Diet is as tolerated. No heavy lifting
greater than 2 pounds for 6 weeks. Continue all medications
