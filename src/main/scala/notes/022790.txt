History of Present Illness:
73 year old female with history of cryptogenic cirrhosis
complicated by encephalopathy (and portal hypertension,
hypersplenism) with multiple recent admissions ([**Date range (1) **]/[**2151**])
who presented to [**Hospital6 5016**] with fatigue, shortness of
breath, wheezing, pruritis on [**2151-4-6**]. She denied any nausea
or vomiting, sick contacts.
.
At OSH, she was gently hydrated with normal saline and her
diuretics were discontinued. Her Rifaximin was initially
discontinued given concern it was causing her pruritis but then
resumed. Her lactulose was continued but her ammonia level
continued to rise and finally decreased to 21 on [**2151-4-11**] and 19
on [**2151-4-14**]. Her liver function tests rose gradually from 50s to
60s and TBili rose from 5.2 to 6.8. The patient was treated with
Vitamin K subcutaneously without much improvement in her INR
(1.9-2.5). The decision was to transfer her liver care and
work-up/second opinion to [**Hospital1 18**]. Regardless the outcome, family
is supportive and very involved and would not want [**Hospital1 1501**]
placement; they would rather take the patient home with them.
.
Renal was consulted for her acute on chronic renal failure,
which was felt due to hypervolemia from liver cirrhosis
extravascularly, hypovolemia from furosemide intravascularly.
She was fluid restricted to one liter and her sodium level
gradually corrected 137 by time of transfer. She was resumed on
her spironolactone by time of discharge without drops in her
serum sodium.
.
The patient was noted to have mild facial asymmetry on [**2151-4-11**]
and then swallowing dyskinesia [**2151-4-13**]. CT head showed advanced
periventricular subcortical white matter changes unchanged from
CT head [**2151-3-22**]. MRI was attempted for ?CVA but patient could
not cooperate with the exam; suboptimal MRI imaging suggested no
definite acute ischemic event. Neurology was consulted, who felt
the patient's oral lingual dyskinesia was most likely metabolic
+/- central pontine myelinolysis. EEG showed moderate-to-severe
generalized cortical dysfunction. Speech and swallow felt the
patient had moderate-to-severe pharyngeal dysphagia, with
impaired respiratory swallow coordination, premature spillage
into pharynx. Thus, the patient was made NPO except for
medications in applesauce and started on maintainance fluids.
NGT was not placed given concern for esophageal varices.
.
Of note, family recounts that her liver disease was first
noticed ~4 years ago. The patient had been sent to
Hematology/Oncology for lab abnormalities
(?anemia/thrombocytopenia). Eventually (~one year later),
ultrasound showed liver disease (?nodular liver w/ cirrhosis).
She was referred to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 89845**] at [**Hospital1 2025**], whom she saw ~twice a year
for management of her liver disease. The family, however, did
not feel anything had been done aside from diagnosis of
"cryptogenic cirrhosis." In particular, no EGD had ever been
performed. Colonoscopy was performed which showed a few polyps
(biopsied, cancer negative) and hemorrhoids. Approximately one
year ago, the patient started decompensating from her liver
disease, with encephalopathy. She has been hospitalized multiple
times since Spring [**2150**] for this and was noted since ~ [**2150-8-7**]
to have worsening renal function (baseline 1.3-1.5). In the last
2-3 weeks, the patient was found for the first time to have
hyponatremia (not a problem before).
.
Upon arrival to [**Hospital1 18**], the patient was resting comfortably in
bed. Moderately engagable, watching television.
.
ROS: Positive per HPI; patient unable to answer rest of ROS

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 73 year old woman with cryptogenic cirrhosis
complicated by encephalopathy likely ascites who presented as a
transfer from an OSH for evaluation and treatment of altered
mental status.
.
Floor course:
# Altered Mental Status: Originally the differential diagnosis
included hepatic encephalopathy, central pontine myelinolysis,
CVA, hyponatremia, steroid induced psychosis, and hospital
induced/ICU delirium. Hepatic encephalopathy was thought to be
likely contributing as worsening mental status decline mirrored
lactulose cessation at the OSH (due to poor PO intake)and family
reports that the facility initially gave the patient less
lactulose than worked at home (30mL TID vs 60mL TID).
Hyponatremia was also likely playing a role, but correction at
the outside facility did not seem to improve her mentation.
Neuro consult was obtained.  Central pontine myelinolysis was
initially thought to be a possibility given her peculiar tongue
movements, but there was no clear evidence of rapid sodium rise
and no evidence on head CT. MRI was limited by motion and
neither ruled in or ruled out such a finding. Lactulose was
started at 30mL q2h with copious stool production (~10 BM/day)
which did nothing to clear her mental status over her first 3
days of admission.
.
# Cirrhosis: Diagnosis of cryptogenic cirrhosis is a diagnosis
of exclusion. Serologies were reportedly negative, but no biopsy
was performed. Has been on diuretics since ~1 year ago
(presumably for ascites). No EGD as of yet. Diagnostic Para
negative for SBP. Hepatitis serologies were repeated which were
negative. Autoimmune serologies were repeated and [**Doctor First Name **] was
positive at 1:160.
.
# Hypernatremia: Upon admission, Ms. [**Known lastname **] was eunatremic. Upon
the third day of her hospital stay, Ms. [**Known lastname **]' sodium was found
to be 152 likely secondary to copious stool production in the
setting of lactulose administration. D5W was started.
