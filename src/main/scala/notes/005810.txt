History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 47828**] is a 26 y.o. female with resistant and progressive
AML diagnosed [**3-9**]. She is s/p 2 cycles of 7 + 3 with
recurrence. She then underwent reindunction with 7+3 with MMUD
allo-BMT c/b abdominal abcess, CHF, respiratory distress 2ndary
to fluid overload, or less likely, pneumonitis (due to CMV+ or
capillary leak syndrome), hyperbili, and renal failure. Pt's
renal failure and hyperbili resolved. Was treated primarily for
CHF with lisinopril and Lasix PRN. EF is 25-30% on last ECHO.
Off Hi-flow mask and Sats >93% on 6LNC-->5LNC

Pt admitted from clinic after presented with one day of abd
cramping, vomiting and diarrhea. CMV serologies positive. No
fevers at home, but spiked fever on admission. Pancultured and
CXR done. Started on Gancyclvir on [**7-5**].

Past Medical History:
AML dx [**3-9**] s/p 7+3 x 2 c/b typhlitis/appendicitis.

Brief Hospital Course:
1) AML: treated with mismatched allo BMT. +75 days.  She was
transfusion dependent throughout her hospital course, for plt
and Hct with parameters for plt transfusion for Plt<10 or Plt<20
if bleeding.  Her hospital course was complicated a number of
issues as follows;

2) ID: CMV positive serologies with diarrhea, now resolved. [**7-7**]
started on ganciclovir and IVIG.  Switched over to
valgancyclovir after decreased CMV [**Month/Day (4) 18617**] load.  Will check
weekly [**Month/Day (4) 18617**] load.  Last checked [**7-25**] (-). Vanco trough due
tonight.  Flagyl d/c'd [**7-26**].  Jaw pain with tender right lower
tooth, written for oxycodone; CT mandible negative. Oxycodone
5mg for pain.

3) Pneumonia/pneumonitis: CXR on [**7-5**] showed diffuse infiltrates
in RML, RLL and LUL. ID consult followed the patient throughout
her course. A BAL done [**7-6**] was neg for PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) **] cultures were
negative. She completed 14d. course of vanco/zosyn (started
[**2174-7-12**]). At discharge, she remained on vanco. Switched over to
prednisone 30mg po qd for GVHD pneumonitis.

4) Pericardial effusion: found on CT [**7-6**]. Pt has had in past
but has increased and is now large effusion with brief R atrial
collapse.  Serial TTE showed no change.

5) CHF: severe L venrtricular hypokenesis [**2-7**] chemo and BMT. In
the ICU, she had respiratory distress and intubation [**2-7**] fluid
overload vs. capillary leak/pneumonitis;  After daily diuresis
in the MICU and then only as needed on the floor, the patient
had rapid improvement, suggesting that the largest component of
the respiratory distress was volume overload.  EF has improved
to 55% on most recent echo with smaller pericardial effusion.
Weaned captopril because of renal insufficiency.  Ordered lasix
prn as one-time orders only as necessary because the patient was
very sensitive to volume changes.

6) Renal: Increased Creatinine secondary to diuresis and
decreased intravascular volume.  Decreased captopril to 6.25 tid
with resolving creatinine.

7) Hx of abd abcess with gram neg bacteremia. Pt did not have
surgery.  No further abdominal complaints on floor.  No signs of
GI GVHD during remainder of hospital course.

8) FEN: Nutrition consulted for low PO's and felt that pt had
enuogh POs to not require TPN.  Now eating actively. Foley d/c'd
[**2174-7-26**], AM.

9) PT/OT.  Physical therapy consulted and rec'd home with PT
secondary to poor balance.
