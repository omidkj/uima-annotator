Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 11415**]
Chief Complaint:
wound infection with pus, septic [**First Name3 (LF) **]

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
operative debridement of infected wound x3

History of Present Illness:
65 yo morbidly obese woman with several potentially
immunocompromising conditions including diabetes, cirrhosis
(attributed to NASH), MGUS, and ulcerative colitis (although
evidently not on any chronically immunosuppressive meds for
this) who fell from standing [**5-11**] and sustained a right femur
fx; this is particularly noteworthy because she has a prior
right hip ORIF as well as bilateral total knee replacements. She
underwent ORIF R femur [**5-13**]; there was extensive hardware
implantation given the extent of the fracture. Course at that
time was complicated by dysuria treated with TMP/SMX DS x3 days
(in addition to peri-op cefazolin); U/A had [**12-9**] WBC and few
bacteria, no accompanying urine culture sent. D/C [**5-20**] to rehab
off antibiotics.
.
By [**5-24**] she was manifesting foul-smelling drainage from the
recent RLE operative site; by [**5-27**] she was hypotensive at rehab
and was sent back to our ED with a BP 80/30 and lactate 4.3.
Code sepsis called, blood culture x1 obtained. Vanc, ceftaz, and
flagyl started. She was found to have fluctuance over her
eythematous right knee that was draining yellow-green pus. She
was taken to the OR [**5-28**] for I&D of skin, subcutaneous tissue
(fat necrosis), and bone, as well as vac placement. Knee
arthrotomy was performed without evidence of a septic joint
clinically.
.
Bld cx (2/2 bottles) from admission with E. coli. All three OR
swabs growing the same E. coli; [**2-22**] growing diphtheroids as
well. Initially treated with vanc, CTX, flagyl post-op, now just
vanc and CTX (day 1 of each is [**5-28**]). Returned to OR [**5-29**] for
second wash-out, likely to return again [**6-2**].
65 yo female s/p ORIF R periprosthetic femur fracture [**5-13**] who
was discharged to rehab on [**2109-5-20**] and presented to [**Hospital1 18**] [**2109-5-28**]
with wound infection and sepsis.  She is now s/p 2
debridements/VAC for wound infection.  Pt admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] from
rehab out of concern from rehab staff for increasing confusion,
low grade fever, and yellow drainage from right thigh incision
site, as well as concerns for pulmonary edema confirmed by CXR
(pt w/o history of CHF) - they had been escalating her aldactone
dose to attempt to reverse this.  On the day af admission at the
rehab she had become hypoxic and tachypnic and was transferred
to [**Hospital1 18**]. In th [**Hospital1 18**] ED Code sepsis called - her BP had
decreased to 79/33, she was given vanco, cefepime, ceftaz as
well as levophed, FFP, and vitamin K (INR was 2.9).  On [**5-28**] pt
to OR for deep I and D of right leg w/ vac placed for wound
infection, flagyl added to vanco/ceftaz regimen, transfused 4
units PRBC for hct 20 (hct 29 on [**5-28**]) - second I and D in OR on
[**5-29**], on [**6-2**] closed deep wound and placed superficial vacs. On
[**5-28**] pt extubated, and the [**5-27**] cultures of blood returned with
[**2-21**] ecoli, wound showed ecoli and diptheroids. ID consulted,
suggested ceftriaxone 2 g qd for ecoli(anticipated 6 wk course
given multiple artificial joints), with vanco for diptheroids.
.
Since admission UOP has been trending down to oliguria and
creatinine trending up.  Fluid boluses with CVP to 20 without
success.  Lasix doses of 20 mg per trial were given w/o
increased output.  Aldactone needed to be briefly dc'd given
hyperkalemia. Last CXR [**6-2**] without pulmonary edema, however she
has had increasing o2 requirements since that time.  Weight had
increased from baseline with max 7 kgs above baseline but now
back to basline.  Volume status has also been complicated by
worsening ascites.
.
On day of transfer to MICU service, transfusion of 2 units
ordered for hct of 23.  On exam by primary team it was felt that
MS [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 28495**], possibly from increased dilaudid overnight but
unsure.  On transfer medications include ceftriaxone and
vancomycin (per dosing), enoxaparin, and aldactone.  All others
ppx medications.
