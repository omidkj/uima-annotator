Studies:
.
# CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2144-7-16**] 8:32 PM
FINDINGS: There is relatively prominent interstitial markings
suggestive of an edema-like pattern. No definite focal
consolidation is noted although slight confluent opacity is seen
in the retrocardiac left lower lobe. The mediastinum is
unremarkable. The cardiac silhouette size is stable. Small
bilateral pleural effusions are evident. There is no
pneumothorax. A PICC line is again identified. Its distal tip is
stable in the region of the brachiocephalic proximal to the
junction with the superior vena cava. An enteric feeding tube is
again noted with the distal tip in the gastric body. A TIPS is
in place stable.
IMPRESSION: Slight confluent opacity in the retrocardiac left
lower lobe which is likely confluent edema although an early
developing pneumonia cannot be entirely excluded. There is mild
volume overload evident. Repeat radiography following
appropriate diuresis is recommended to assess for underlying
infection.
.
# DUPLEX DOPP ABD/PEL  [**2144-7-17**] 10:56 AM
FINDINGS: The lumen of the tips appears patent. The proximal,
mid, and distal aspects of the tips demonstrate velocities of
29, 44 and 99 cm per second respectively, compared with a 69 and
145 cm per second on the previous study.  Hepatopedal flow is
noted in the main portal vein with a velocity of approximately
20 cm per second.  No flow is identified in the left or right
portal vein.  In the liver parenchyma, there is a 2.6 x 1.7 x
1.2 anechoic lesion, present on the previous examinations and
representing a simple hepatic cyst.
IMPRESSION:
1. No flow identified within the left portal vein and in the
right portal vein concerning for thrombosis. CT is recommended
for further evaluation.
2. Decreased velocities within the TIPS.
3. Simple hepatic cyst.
4. Moderate ascites.
.
# ECHO Study Date of [**2144-7-17**]
Conclusions: The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size
and regional/global systolic function (LVEF 55%). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.  There
are three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets are
moderately thickened. No masses or vegetations are seen on the
aortic valve.  There is no aortic valve stenosis. Mild (1+)
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse.  No mass or
vegetation is seen on the mitral valve. Moderate (2+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is
seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
No vegetation/mass is seen on the pulmonic valve. There is no
pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of endocarditis. Symmetric LVH with
preserved global and regional biventricular systolic function.
Mild aortic regurgitation.  Moderate mitral regurgitation.
Moderate tricuspid regurgitation. Moderate pulmonary
hypertension.  Compared with the prior study (images reviewed)
of [**2144-6-11**], left ventricular function is not as vigorous
(though still in the normal range). Mitral and tricuspid
regurgitation are better visualized, but are probably similar in
severity. Pulmonary pressures have increased.
.
# CT CHEST W/O CONTRAST  [**2144-7-18**] 11:30 AM
Findings:Multiple stable heavily calcified irregular pulmonary
nodules in both lungs measuring up to 14 mm are unchanged in
size and appearance and likely represent metastatic
calcification which is not an uncommon finding after recent
liver transplantation. The lungs are otherwise clear. There has
been interval development of moderate right-sided and small
left-sided pleural effusion. The airways are patent up to the
subsegmental level. The heart and great vessels of the
mediastinum are remarkable for aortic valvular and aortic
atherosclerotic calcification. No pathologically enlarged
axillary, mediastinal, or hilar lymph nodes are seen. Visualized
portion of the abdomen are remarkable for TIPS located within
the right posterior portal vein branch, NG tube in the stomach
and metastatic calcification of both renal cortices. No
concerning lytic or sclerotic lesions are noted within bones.
IMPRESSION:
1. New moderate right-sided pleural effusion and small
left-sided pleural effusion.
2. Stable calcified nodules due to metastatic pulmonary
calcification.
3. Ascites.
4. Metastatic calcification of both renal cortices.
