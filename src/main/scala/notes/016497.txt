Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1838**]
Chief Complaint:
Unwitnessed fall

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
PER ADMITTING RESIDENT:
HPI: The pt is a [**Age over 90 **]  year-old R-handed w/ hx of HTN, MI, Vulvar
cancer on ASA and multiple falls over the past 2 years who was
taken to [**Hospital3 4107**] after being found s/p unwitnessed fall.

Pt. reportedly in USOH, until she was found by [**Hospital3 400**]
facility staff on the floor, with LOC.  No staff memeber from [**Doctor Last Name **]
who witnessed the event was available for interview, and per
discussion w/ family it is not clear how long the patient had
LOC.  However, after "several minutes" of LOC, patient was noted
to be awake, but disoriented (AxOx2) and did not recall falling
(usually "sharp as a tac, Axox3, able to carry on a full
conversation, avid reader), but still conversant.  At this time
she was taken to [**Hospital3 4107**], where her BG was 127.  On
arrival had BP of 240/108, 88.  She was placed into C-collar,
given supplementary O2 and underwent a CT head which showed
multiple frontal b/l IPHs and SAHs. At this time she was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further care.

Upon arrival, she underwent a repeat CT head, showing
progression
of L frontal hemorrhage, new L frontal IPH, increase in R SDH,
but otherwise unchanged.  She received morphine IV for pain, was
treated with Ciprofloxacin for a positive UA.  No initial
neurological exam is available.  She was evaluated by
neurosurgery, who felt that there was no surgical intervention
necessary. She received 6pack of platelets.

At time of the interview, patient was able to open eyes to
voice,
but unable to hold a congruent conversation (see exam below).

Per discussion w/ [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], old friend, and son's wife,
Mrs.
[**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) 60568**], pt was independent in all her ADLs (needed help
getting into/out of shower only), ambulated up and down stairs
using railing and used walker at other times.  She is "sharp as
a
tack" and has no memory problems.  She has been living in [**Doctor Last Name **] at
Sethmann home in [**Location (un) 5110**], MA. She has hx of multiple falls over
the past 2 years, last [**11-12**].  Knows current events.

Social History:

IMAGING:
.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST ([**2120-9-16**]):
IMPRESSIONS: Little change in multiple foci of subarachnoid
hemorrhage,
slight increase in size of some of the preexisting multifocal
intraparenchymal hemorrhages, and interval increase in the right
parietal extraaxial hemorrhage compared to outside hospital
study performed little over two hours prior. One focus of newly
apparent 8-mm intraparenchymal hemorrhage seen in the left
frontal lobe. No newly developed shift of normally midline
structures or effacement of the basal cisterns.
.
CT Head without Contrast ([**2120-9-16**]):
IMPRESSION: Overall, minimal change from the study done a few
hours
previously with redemonstration of extensive foci of
intraparenchymal
hemorrhage as well as subarachnoid and subdural hemorrhage.
.
CT Head without Contrast ([**2120-9-17**]):
IMPRESSION:
1. Minimal change of multiple intraparenchymal and subarachnoid
hemorrhagic foci in comparison to prior study.
2. No interval change of the right parietal subdural hematoma.
.
Plain Elbow Films ([**2120-9-16**]):
REASON FOR EXAM: S/P fall, new ecchymosis.
There is no evidence of fracture or dislocation. There are no
calcifications in the soft tissues.





Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 60568**] is a [**Age over 90 **] year old woman with a past medical history
including hypertension and vulvar cancer who presented to [**Hospital1 **] following an unwitnessed fall.  There a CT of the head
revealed multiple intraparenchymal hemorrhages.  The patient was
subsequently transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] for further care; she was
admitted to the stroke service from [**2120-9-16**] to [**2120-9-20**].
.
# NEURO
The patient was initially admitted to the ICU, where she was
monitored closely.  Compared to the CT done at [**Hospital1 **], initial
[**Hospital1 18**] imaging demonstrated minimal change in the multiple foci
of subarachnoid hemorrhage with a slight increase in the size of
some of the preexisting multifocal intraparenchymal hemorrhages
and an interval increase in the right parietal extraaxial
hemorrhage. One new  focus of intraparenchymal hemorrhage was
observed in the left frontal lobe.   Of note, there was no
midline shift or effacement of the basal cisterns. The patient's
neurological examination remained stable, and repeat head CTs
showed no further progression of the hemorrhages.  To provide
seizure prophylaxis, keppra 500 mg [**Hospital1 **] was started.  The keppra
should be continued until [**2120-9-25**].
.
After discussions with her son, and health care proxy, a
decision was made to perform no further investigatory stu
