History of Present Illness:
This is an 86 year old female with [**Last Name (un) 499**] cancer and carcinoid
lung cancer recently resected (5 years ago, in remission), known
MAC not being treated, and esophageal motility issues. Admitted
to [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] [**12-8**] c/o dysphasia for several days and found to
have aspiration pneumonia and food impaction.

Per family she had 3 days of diarrhea which was very runny but
not bloody. Nurse thought she had had a virus and gave her
immodium and her diarrhea stopped. Niece spoke with her on
Monday and she said that she was having difficulty swallowing
both solids and liquids -- not even a teaspoon of water without
it coming back up. On Tues she called her PCP who told her to go
to the hospital and get hydrated, as she had not had anything to
drink (that she kept down) for 3 days. She presented to [**Hospital1 **]
[**Location (un) 620**] where they gave her 3L NS and admitted her for [**Last Name (un) **].
Niece visited her Wednesday morning, she was down for an
endoscopy which showed a lot of residual food in her esophagus,
including multiple pills. They pushed it through (took 20
minutes). Also noticed an esophageal web, perfectly benign, but
would try to open it with a balloon the next day. Also did a
barium swallow test on Wednesday which was not definitive in
terms of difficulty swallowing. They decided they wanted a
motility test (not done at [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**]). Thursday went down for
second endoscopy to open up web by which point she had spiked a
fever so they postponed the procedure. CXR showed a PNA. Assumed
that she had aspirated and started treatment for aspiration PNA.
Friday morning she was hypoxic to the point of needing a face
mask but needed to breath very hard. Friday night they felt they
needed to intubate her given her difficulty breathing. Intubated
about 1AM Fri-Sat overnight. CT scan this morning showed that
her PNA was worse.

CT scan showed bilateral infiltrates felt to be consistent with
aspiration PNA. An EGD did not show any significant obstruction
but some food particles were partially removed. She initially
did well but then on [**12-11**] she deteriorated and went into
respiratory distress. She remained hypoxic on 100% face mask.
After discussion with the family she was intubated.

Repeat chest CT showed worsening of bilateral multifocal
infiltrates felt most likely consistent with recurrent
aspiration with possible ARDS vs CHF. P/F ratio 58%/100%. No
history of CHF. Probably mostly aspiration PNA. Already on
levoquin and flagyl but added vancomycin.

Had also had some [**Last Name (un) **], had gotten some fluids but not that much.
CT scan which ruled out any mediastinitis. She remained
hemodynamically stable overnight with stable blood gases.
Vancomycin was added on top of Levaquin and Flagyl which she was
already on.

The family feels that because most of her doctors are in [**Name5 (PTitle) 86**]
they would like her transferred. She is being transferred for
further management of respiratory failure, multifocal pneumonia,
and aspiration pneumonia and pneumonitis on this patient.

Upon transfer from [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] VSS and as below. She was
intubated on A/C TV 400 FiO2 0.4. She was hemodynamically stable
not on pressors. Access was only peripherals but they were
trying to get a PICC prior to transfer. No need for CVL.
.
Upon arrival in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] she is sedated, intubated, and appears
in NAD.


Past Medical History:
MAC, untreated
lung carcinoid
[**Hospital Unit Name 499**] cancer
Atrial Fibrillation s/p pacemaker placement, stable
HTN, stable
Hypercholesterolemia, stable
Osteoporosis
Status post right hemicolectomy
Status post appendectomy
Status post TAH BSO
.
ONCOLOGIC HISTORY:
[**2099**]: found to have iron deficiency anemia and elevated CEA.
Colonoscopy demonstrated a large cecal mass.
[**2101-1-7**] hemicolectomy with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1924**]; lesion was T3N0M0 and has
been followed clinically since this time
[**2105-3-3**] colonoscopy by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 172**] showed no abnormalities;
next colonoscopy recommended in [**2109**]. Preoperative CXR showed
abnormality noted in the LUL.
[**2101-3-25**]: VATS with left upper lobectomy; pathology demonstrated a
3.3 x 2.0 x 2.0 cm well differentiated bronchial carcinoid
tumor. Followed clinically by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] since this
resection.
[**2104-4-3**] routine scheduled CT chest demonstrated a new
endobronchial nodule at the bifurcation of the right upper lobe
bronchus suspicious for endobronchial recurrence of the
carcinoid. It also demonstrated multiple new masses,
consolidations and nodules that might represent either multiple
metastatic lung disease or be a combination of metastasis with
pulmonary infection. She underwent bronchoscopy/BAL/RUL
endobronchial lesion biopsy and cryoablation of the
endobronchial tumor with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]. Pathology of the
endobronchial lesion demonstrated bronchial carcinoid tumor,
similar to the previously resected LUL mass. All BAL fluid and
the CT-guided parenchymal tissue biopsy grew mycobacterium avium
complex.
[**2104-4-24**] octreotide scan revealed two areas of increased tracer
uptake in the right middle and lower lobes corresponding to
masses on the noncontrast enhanced chest CT and consistent with
metastatic disease.
