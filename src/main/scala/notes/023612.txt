Findings
This study was compared to the prior study of [**2150-6-18**].
LEFT ATRIUM: Elongated LA.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Mildly dilated RA.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thickness and cavity size.
Suboptimal technical quality, a focal LV wall motion abnormality
cannot be fully excluded. [Intrinsic LV systolic function likely
depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.
Paradoxic septal motion consistent with prior cardiac surgery.

AORTA: Normal aortic diameter at the sinus level.

AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (?#). Mild
(1+) AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. Mitral
valve annuloplasty ring. Calcified tips of papillary muscles.
Moderate (2+) MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Mildly thickened tricuspid valve leaflets.
Moderate [2+] TR. Normal PA systolic pressure.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Pulmonic valve not well seen.

PERICARDIUM: There is an anterior space which most likely
represents a fat pad, though a loculated anterior pericardial
effusion cannot be excluded.

GENERAL COMMENTS: Suboptimal image quality - poor subcostal
views. Suboptimal image quality - bandages, defibrillator pads
or electrodes. Suboptimal image quality as the patient was
difficult to position. Emergency study performed by the
cardiology fellow on call. Left pleural effusion.

REGIONAL LEFT VENTRICULAR WALL MOTION:





     N = Normal, H = Hypokinetic, A = Akinetic, D = Dyskinetic
Conclusions
The left atrium is elongated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
and cavity size are normal. Overall systolic function is good
(LVEF = 35-40%) with inferior and inferolateral hypokinesis. Due
to suboptimal technical quality, other focal wall motion
abnormalities cannot be fully excluded. [Intrinsic left
ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the
severity of valvular regurgitation.] Right ventricular chamber
size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets
are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. A well-seated
mitral valve annuloplasty ring is present with normal gradient.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.The tricuspid valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate [2+] tricuspid
regurgitation is seen. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic
pressure is normal. There is an anterior space which most likely
represents a fat pad.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2150-6-18**],
the left ventricular cavity is smaller, a mitral annuloplasty
ring is identified, and the estimated pulmonary artery systolic
pressure is lower. The severity of mitral regurgitation is
reduced, but remains moderate. Global LVEF is slightly
reduced/similar. A left pleural effusion is now seen.

Brief Hospital Course:
 On [**2150-7-15**] Ms. [**Known lastname 60333**] [**Last Name (Titles) 1834**] a [**Last Name (Titles) **] artery bypass
grafting times one (SVG to OM) and a mitral repair (#26mm
[**Company 1543**] annuloplasty ring).  Please refer to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
operative note for further details.  She tolerated the procedure
well and was transferred in critical but stable condition to the
surgical intensive care unit. POD#1 she was extubated and weaned
from her pressors.  Lines and drains were discontinued in a
timely fashion. POD#2 she was transferred to the step down floor
for further monitoring and progression. Physical therapy
consulted and evaluation was performed. Her rhythm went into
atrial fibrillation and Beta-blocker was increase
