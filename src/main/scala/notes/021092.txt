Pertinent Results:
Echo  [**7-6**]: PRE-CPB A left-to-right shunt across the interatrial
septum is seen at rest. A small secundum atrial septal defect is
present. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and
systolic function are normal(LVEF>55%). The right ventricular
cavity is mildly dilated. Right ventricular systolic function is
normal. POST-CPB Normal biventricular systolic function. [**Doctor First Name **]
valvular function. ASD s/p closure with pledgets. Some small
pinhole flow is noted - normal at this stage after such repair.

CXR [**7-7**]: Small right apical pneumothorax is new and newly
apparent. Atelectasis in the portion of the right lung has
improved, but there is still substantial right infrahilar
consolidation and rightward shift of the mediastinum and
elevation of the right lung base, all due to atelectasis, are
unchanged. Left lung is clear. Heart size is normal but
increased since the previous examination and there is more
mediastinal venous engorgement. Tip of the left internal jugular
line projects over the SVC. Left lung clear.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] was a same day admit following all pre-operative
work-up done as an outpatient. On [**2134-7-6**] she was brought to the
operating room where she underwent a minimal invasive atrial
septal defect closure. Please see operative report for surgical
details. Following surgery she was transferred to the CSRU for
invasive monitoring in stable condition. Later on op day she was
weaned from sedation, awoke neurologically intact and extubated.
On post-op day one she was started on beta blockers and
diuretics and gently diureses towards her pre-op weight. She was
then transferred to the cardiac surgery telemetry floor. Also on
this day, her chest tube was put to water seal and it was
apparent on chest x-ray that she had a pneumothorax. Therefore
chest tube was placed back on suction. The following morning her
chest tube was placed on waterseal, and her x-ray showed a
slightly larger pneumothorax. Her chest tube was then clamped to
see if she could tolerate this, and she did very well. The
following morning a chest x-ray revealed a stable tiny PTX. her
chest tube was removed on [**7-11**]. A final x-ray showed a stable,
tiny PTX and she was discharged home.
