Shortness of breath

History of Present Illness:
80yo Chinese-speaking F PMHx dCHF (LVEF of 72% [**5-/2190**]) on home
O2, CAD s/p Xience DES to RCA ([**5-/2189**]), AS s/p AVR, DM, PAD,
HTN, HLD, OSA on bipap at home, cerebrovascular disease s/p
right carotid endarterectomy in [**3-/2190**], pAF who presented to the
ED w worsening shortness of breath and altered mental status,
now s/p intubation and CVL placement in the ED.  Ms. [**Known lastname **] was
recently admitted to [**Hospital1 2025**] [**6-3**]-/[**6-10**] for dCHF exacerbation in
addmition to severe OSA and again from [**Date range (1) 20550**] for afib which
converted spontaneously.  In the weeks prior to her admission,
she saw her outpatient cardiologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and reported
increased SOB and worsening [**Location (un) **]; her home lasix dosing was
increased from 40mg PO BID to 60mg PO BID with interval
improvement in her swelling and breathing.  For uncertain
reasons, she then returned to her baseline lasix dosing, and
subsequently re-developed worsening symptoms.  On the day of
admission, her family became concerned regarding her symptom
progression and planned to take her to [**Hospital1 2025**] for a scheduled
admission (discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] that day).  On the drive
over, she became acutely more short of breath, lethargic.  Her
son diverted to [**Hospital1 18**], where he flagged down EMS, who
transported her to the ED.
.
Initial vital signs in the ED HR 88 BP 160/30 RR 12 78% on NRB.
Patient was not following commands, and given concern for airway
protection, underwent rapid sequence intubation w
etomidate/succinyl choline.  She had a CVL placed and was
transiently on a levophed drip for brief episode of hypotension
attributed to propofol.  She received ASA 600 PR, nitro drip,
100mg IV lasix.  EKG did not demonstrate ischemic changes.  She
was admitted to CCU for further management of fluid status.
.
On arrival to the CCU, she is intubated and sedated.  Her
daughters (all of which are supposedly [**Name (NI) 18133**]) and son were
present and confirmed the above history.  Per their report, she
has not had any recent illnesses, fevers, chills, cough, sputum
production, chest pain, numbness, weakness/tingling,
orthopnea/PND.

Pertinent Results:
[**2190-10-8**] CXR
Pulmonary edema with moderate right and tiny left pleural
effusion. Top
normal heart size.

[**2190-10-10**] CT Chest w/o Contrast
1. Large right, moderate left simple pleural effusion with
subsegmental
atelectasis of the bilateral lower and right middle lobes.
2. Prominence of the pulmonary arteries, consistent with
pulmonary
hypertension. There is no focal consolidation to suggest the
diagnosis of
pneumonia, nor evidence for ARDS.

Brief Hospital Course:
HOSPITAL COURSE SUMMARY
This is an 80yo Chinese-speaking female with a PMHx of dCHF, CAD
s/p DES to RCA AVR, OSA on bipap at home, pAF who presented with
hypoxia and altered mental status requiring intubation, now
status-post diuresis of 5L, remaining intubated, with family
requesting transfer to [**Hospital1 2025**].
.
# Hypoxic Respiratory Failure / Acute Diastolic CHF: Pt w
history of dCHF presenting w profound hypoxia requiring
intubation, w signs of volume overload on admission exam,
imaging, labs; etiology of acute failure exacerbation is
uncertain as no signs of ischemia by EKG or cardiac enzymes;
patient was diuresed with IV lasix drip w improvement in
respiratory status, but remaining w ventilator requirements.
Hospital day 2, patient spiked fever to 101.3 and was started on
respiratory coverage with cefepime/vancomycin/azithro.  Imaging
demonstrated large R and moderate L plueral effusions,
suggesting additional restrictive component to respiratory
failure.  Patient was evaluated with bedside ultrasound of
pleural fluid prior to transfer, which did not demonstrate
significant tapable fluid.  Patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 2025**] for
further management.
.
# Rhythm: Patient w history of Afib (not anticoagulated),
admitted in sinus bradycardia (her baseline) but converted to
afib on
