Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4748**]
Chief Complaint:
Aortic arch pseudoaneurysm and left
common carotid artery stenosis.


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Left carotid subclavian bypass with 7-mm Dacron.
Primary stenting of the left common carotid artery.
Surgical ligation of the left subclavian artery.
Perclose closure of the right common femoral arteriotomy.
Endovascular exclusion of the aortic arch pseudoaneurysm with a
Zenith Cook TX2 36-mm x 127-mm Endograft.


History of Present Illness:
This is a 73-year-old male with a
history of an abdominal aortic aneurysm repair who presents
with an expanding pseudoaneurysm of his aortic arch just
distal to the left subclavian artery.  His anatomy was
amenable to endovascular exclusion of the pseudoaneurysm.
However, in order to get appropriate seal proximally, we did
have to cover the left subclavian artery.  Given this, we
consented him for carotid subclavian bypass.  Based on his
preoperative imaging there was stenosis at the origin of the
left carotid artery.  We planned to stent the left common
carotid artery.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr [**Known lastname **] had a lumbar drain prior to going to the OR.  He was
brought to the OR on [**5-8**] for L carotid to subclavian bypass,
thoracic aneurysm exclusion, and carotid artery stenting.
Please refer to operative notes. He awoke neurologically intact.
He did well after the procedure and was monitored in the CVICU.
For any lumbar pressures > 15 csf fluid was drained.  He had ~
70cc drained each day the first two days. By POD 3 his lumbar
pressures didn't require further drainage.  The drain was pulled
on POD 4 and his foley was discontinued.  His hct drifted from
33 down to 25 but remained stable at 25 and increased to 28 on
discharge.  He was transferred to the vascular floor with tele
to evaluate his multiple PACs. His K and Mg were replaced.  He
remained HD stable and neurologically intact. His neck staples
were taken out and steri-strips placed before discharge.
