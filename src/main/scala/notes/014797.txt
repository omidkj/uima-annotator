Angioedema

Intubation

History of Present Illness:
Pt is an 85 y/o F with a h/o GAVE s/p Argon treatment last on
[**2150-3-11**], iron deficiency anemia, Cirrhosis [**1-19**] HepC, portal
HTN/grade 1 varices but no hx of bleeding varices, CRI (baseline
Cr = 1.2-1.5) who is transfered from [**Hospital3 **] intubated
s/p angioedema. By report the pt has some mild abdominal pain
and some irritation in her throat a day prior to admission to
[**Hospital3 **]. The following morning she called her son with
complaints of oral swelling; son states that her speach was
garbled. The son reports that the patient denies having had any
SOB, no wheezing, no hives. He called an abmulance who
transported the pt to [**Hospital3 **].
.
Per OMR, the patient present to [**Hospital1 18**] pheresis unit on [**2150-4-10**]
for blood transfusion for chronic slow upper GI bleeding. She
had no pretreatment medications given and no adverse events;
vitals on leaving the unit were 97.4 - 67 - 119/55. She has also
been recently treated for a UTI with bactrim started on [**2150-4-3**].

.
At St Elizabeths', she was HD stable but had a large, edematous
tongue. She recevied decadron, epinephrine, benadryl, famotidine
and hydroxazine in the ED. The ED was unable to intubate and she
was taken to the OR. Laryngeal edema was noted, but the ET tube
was passed successfully. She was then transfered to the CCU. She
received hydroxazine TID and her tongue swelling improved. SBT
was attempted early on but failed likely secondary to sedation.
Per report, pt did have a cuff leak. Family requested transfer
to [**Hospital1 18**] as pt receives all her care here.
.
On arrival in the MICU she passed an SBT and was successfully
extubated. She did well throughout the day but continued to have
an O2 requirement. By the time of transfer to the floor she was
on 2L of NC O2 satting 94%. On the floor she is alert and
oriented. She does not know what caused her swelling. She denies
new pills, new medications, or new foods. She feels well and has
no SOB, itching, or complaints.

Brief Hospital Course:
85F with a h/o GAVE s/p argon laser treatment last on [**2150-3-11**],
iron deficiency anemia due to chronic UGIB, cirrhosis [**1-19**] HCV,
portal HTN with grade 1 varices but no history variceal
bleeding, CRI (baseline Cr = 1.2-1.5) who is s/p prolonged
intubatation for angioedema of unknown etiology - possibly due
to Bactrim. She is doing very well on s/p extubation at this
point. All antihistamines have been discontinued at this point.
She was progressively be restarted on her home meds.
.
# Angioedema: Resoved. Lack of hives, bronchospasm or
hypotension suggests that this was not allergic angioedema but
rather bradykinin related. C3 and C4 were low. C1 esterase
inhibitor pending, [**Doctor First Name **] neg. Per allergy consult at [**Hospital 7302**] prior to transfer, non-allergic angioedema
is due to complement depletion (either hereditary or CA related)
or complement activation (infection or transfusion). The patient
did have a transfusion recently which may be related.
Medications would also be high on the list of etiologies. Common
offenders are NSAIDS and ACEIs, but ARBs have also been
implicated.  It was discovered that the Pt was taking Bactrim
when the reaction leading to her admission. This is a possible
offender and has been added to her allergy list. Restarted home
meds one by one. All but felodipine have been restarted. Had
hives and itching the day prior to discharge which did not
generalize and seemed more of a contact dermatitis on the L arm.
No new medications were started so it is unclear what initiated
this. Responded to hydroxyzine x1. Also of note, the patient
refused to shower or be washed down this admission which may
contribute to her itchiness.
.
# Chronic UGIB: Received regular blood transfusions as an
outpatient for any HCT < 30. In the past she only needed them
infrequently but her transfusion requirements have increased
lately. Transfused prior to discharge. [**Month (only) 116**] need outpatient
follow up with GI (Dr [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1158**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 679**] has been recommended by her
outpatient gastroenterologist [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 2127**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 10113**]).
.
# Wheezes and ronchi: Related to angioedema and volume overload
most likely. Resolved with diuresis and nebulizers.
.
# Hx HCV complicated by cirrhosis. No evidence of encephalopathy
now, but is at risk. Continued lactulose. Continued
SPIRONOLACTONE [ALDACTONE] - 50 mg daily. Continue FUROSEMIDE
[LASIX] - 40 mg daily. Continue NADOLOL - 80 mg daily as PPx
against variceal bleeding.
.
# HTN: Holding home CCB as normotensive. On Nadolol as above.
.
# CRI: baseline 1.5, was elevated on admission to [**Hospital3 5097**] to
1.7. At baseline on discharge.
.
# Diabetes: ISS in house. Discharged on metformin.
