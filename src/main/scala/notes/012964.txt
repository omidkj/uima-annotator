Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 99**]
Chief Complaint:
SOB/Hypoxemia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
66 yo nursing home resident with h/o obesity, OSA who was
recently diagnosed at [**Hospital3 2737**] with multiple PEs, on
coumadin who presents to [**Hospital1 18**] with worsening hypoxemia.
.
Per [**Name6 (MD) **] home MD, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], patient was diagnosed at OSH with
PEs on [**2197-12-18**] after developing hypoxemia and new oxygen
requirement.  Per report, [**Date Range **] at OSH were negative for DVT,
while CTA chest was positive for PE.  She was started lovenox
bridge to coumadin (lovenox was d/c'd on [**2197-12-23**] when
therapeutic INR) at that time and was discharged back to the
[**Location (un) 2498**] NH.  She reportedly has been therapeutic on coumadin
(last INR at NH was supratherapeutic at 3.7) since her [**Hospital1 **] stay.  She reports that since her d/c from [**Hospital1 **],
however, she has had persistent shortness of breath and has
required constant oxygen.  This am, her PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was
making rounds at the NH and she informed him of her symptoms as
above.  This morning her 02 sat was 90% on 5L NC.  He was
concerned by lack of improvement and ? worsening hypoxemia and
suggested transfer to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation.
.
Pt. reports no prior h/o DVTs nor PEs either in herself nor
family members. She does, however, report 2 miscarriages.  She
currently denies CP, palpitations.  No cough.
.
In the [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] sign out, she was found to be tachycardic,
tachypneic (although there is no documentation of tachycardia
nor tachypnea), and hypoxic with SBPs low 100s.  Despite
therapeutic INR (2.7 in ED here), CTPA was performed which
showed e/o multiple partially occlusive 2nd order brand PEs in
both lower lobes and right upper lobe.  She received
levofloxacin x1 for ? of LLL infiltrate on CXR.  She was started
on heparin gtt at this time and was transferred to the ICU given
her questionable HD stability.
.
ROS:  She denies cough, chest pain, palpitations.  She denies
fevers/chills. No lightheadedness/dizziness. No N/V/diarrhea. No
melena/hematochezia, no dysuria/hematuria. No orthopnea,
+intermittent LE edema worse over the past month.  Denies calf
pain currently (had mild calf pain on presentation to [**Hospital1 **],
but [**Hospital1 **] were negative).

.
CXR: Left lower lobe opacity likely due to atelectasis, although
an
early developing pneumonia or possibly a pulmonary infarction in
light of given history cannot be entirely excluded.
.
CTA chest:
1.  Partially occlusive PEs in second order branches of right
upper and both lower lobes as described.  Comparison with a
prior outside hospital CTA, if available, is recommended to
assess for interval evolution.
2.  Small left pleural effusion.
3.  Dependent atelectatic changes, moderate on the left and mild
on the right.
.
EKG:  NSR 80bpm, nml axis, nml intervals, TWI V1-V3, isolated Q

Brief Hospital Course:
65 yoF w/ h/o HTN, CHF, and recently diagnosed PE presents to
[**Hospital1 18**] from NH with persistent SOB and hypoxemia.
.
# Hypoxemia:  Given recent diagnosis of PE (diagnosed at [**Hospital1 **] on [**2197-12-18**]) and CTA chest findings on admission to
[**Hospital1 18**] positive for PEs, hypoxemia most likely [**1-5**] to this
process.  There was, however, some question as to whether
perhaps an increase in pulmonary pressures in the setting of PEs
caused reversal of intracardiac shunt.  TTE was obtained to rule
out intracardiac defect and shunt as well as CHF and was found
to be normal without e/o RV dysfunction/strain, intracardiac
defect, nor significant systolic/diastolic dysfunction.  She
does carry a new diagnosis of CHF and had crackles on pulmonary
exam, although echocardiogram as above was found to be normal.
Her admission BNP was normal at 51.  Thus, CHF seemed an
unlikely contributor to her hypoxemia; she was continued on her
home dose lasix.  She reported no h/o cough, fever, no elevated
WBC count so underlying infection was not a contributor.
Notably, she does have a history of OSA and had a metabolic
alkalosis on admission so there is some question of chronically
hypercarbic and hypoxic in setting of possible obesity
hypoventilation syndrome (her body habitus would be c/w this).
During her stay in the ICU, she was placed on her home settings
of CPAP for sleep and tolerated 2L of O2 by NC during the day,
maintaining O2 saturations of low to mid 90s.  By time of
discharge she ranged from room air to 2L NC and was maintaining
O2 saturations low to mid 90s at rest and with ambulation.
.
# Pulmonary emboli:  As above, recently diagnosed at OSH
([**2197-12-18**]).  Per nursing home reports, she had been bridged on
therapeutic lovenox to coumadin with therapeutic INR.  Thus, the
question of coumadin failure was entertained.  Given the recent
diagnosis and no clear increased O2 requirement (just persistent
O2 requirement and dyspnea since diagnosis of PE on [**12-18**]), it
seemed less likely coumadin failure as opposed to natural course
of her known PE.  [**Hospital3 2737**] was contact[**Name (NI) **] and actual
images (CTA chest) were obtained so that our radiologists could
review and compare her admission CTA to further evaluate
increased clot burden while therapeutic on lovenox then
coumadin.  [**Hospital1 18**] radiologists reviewed these OSH images and
found that clot burden appeared stable if not slightly improved
on her admission imaging at [**Hospital1 18**].  Heparin gtt started in the
ED was discontinued in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] and coumadin was restarted.  Her
INR was subtherapeutic x2 days prior to discharge, however, (1.3
on day of discharge) so she received therapeutic dose of SC
lovenox which she will need to continue until her INR is again
therapeutic.  The etiology of her PEs is unclear.  [**Name2 (NI) **] were
negative at [**Hospital3 2737**].   She has not had age approprate
cancer screening; she reports mammography "many years ago" and
no history of colonoscopy nor recent gynecologic care.  She does
report a history of 2 miscarriages (also had several successful
pregnancies), but no history of clots in her as well as family
members as far as she knows.
