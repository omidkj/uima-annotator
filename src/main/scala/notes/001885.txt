Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1253**]
Chief Complaint:
FEVERS, WEAKNESS

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
NONE

History of Present Illness:
82M with history of HTN, HL, BPH and prior stroke, who initially
presented to an OSH on [**2139-7-3**] with 2-3 day history of fevers to
101, chills, and malaise. Patient reports that over the several
days preceding his admission, he felt increasingly fatigued and
weak. Had poor appetite and became so weak he had difficulty
walking. Presented to [**Hospital 1562**] Hospital for evaluation. At OSH,
he was admitted with presumed sepsis of unclear etiology,
pan-cultured and empirically started on ceftriaxone. Was noted
to have a mild transaminitis and underwent RUQ ultrasound, which
showed fatty infiltration of the liver. CXR in ED did not show
PNA, and there was no evidence of a UTI. He continued to have
fevers to 101.9, and antibiotics were broadened to vanc/zosyn.
Given L knee pain and swelling, Ortho consulted and patient
underwent MRI of L knee and arthrocentesis on [**7-7**]. Synovial
fluid w/4182 WBCs, 6000 RBCs, no crystals. Felt unlikely to be
septic joint. ID was consulted, and given concern for tick-borne
illness, patient started on azithro/atovaquone and doxycycline.
Zosyn d/c'd, vanco continued. On [**7-9**],
azithro/atovaquone/doxy/vanc d/c'd and patient started on
ertapenem. Testing for Lyme, Babesia, and anaplasma had all
returned negative, and blood cultures remained negative. The
patient had no focal symptoms, including no CP, SOB, cough,
abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea, or dysuria. He remained
hemodynamically stable.
However, he did develop hypoxia, which was attributed to acute
on chronic dCHF in setting of iatrogenic volume overload. Noted
to have bilateral pleural effusions. He was started on lasix 20
mg IV BID, with decrease in O2 requirement.
He underwent a CT torso on [**7-8**], to evaluate for possible
abscess or malignancy given unclear source of fever. No abscess
or pathologic lymphadenopathy noted. Given question of possible
cholecystitis on imaging, General Surgery was consulted. Urology
was consulted given findings of non-obstructing nephrolithiasis
and ureterolithiasis. Also of note, patient's WBC rose
throughout his hospital course, from 13 on admission to as high
as 40.5 on [**7-8**]. Heme/Onc consulted, but as patient's family was
requesting transfer to a tertiary care center, the consultation
was put on hold. Plan was to stop antibiotics and pursue further
work-up for non-infectious causes of fever at [**Hospital1 18**]. Of note,
[**Doctor First Name **] came back positive at 1:80.
On arrival to [**Hospital1 18**], he reports ongoing fatigue but is otherwise
without complaints. He recently returned to the area from
[**State 108**], but has otherwise not traveled recently. No sick
contacts. [**Name (NI) **] insect or tick bites. Had had mild nausea which has
since resolved, and he did not have any vomiting. Also reports
several episodes of loose stools, non-bloody.
