confirmed with patient on admission.

87 year-old woman with psoriatic arthritis, recurrent PE on
lifelong coumadin, HTN, with painful rectal fissure in the
setting of  diarrhea, recently admitted for supportive care in
anticipation of a  possible fissurectomy. S/p anal fissure
surgery on [**2133-5-22**] which revealed rectal ulcers which prompted a
colonoscopy.  Colonoscopy performed on [**2133-5-26**] and  revealed
colitis from the rectum to 25cm into the colon.  Path  showed
severe active colitis.  Steroids and antibiotics were  started
per GI recs. Liquid prednisolone (37.5mg) daily and
Ciprofloxacin initiated. Pain improved and diet was advanced to
low residue diet. She was discharged home to ALF. She was
feeling well w/o abdominal pain, n/[**Name8 (MD) 18704**] RN  at the ALF was
home with her assisting with medicine administration. She went
to the BR and noted clots in the diaper. [**Name8 (MD) **] RN also noted that
she had passed bright red clots. No symptoms and she wanted to
stay home but her RN insisted that she came to the ED. Another
clot was visualized in her diaper by the ED physician. [**Name10 (NameIs) **] and
surgery were contact[**Name (NI) **]. Surgery will see the pt. HCT down to 31
from 33.0. HD stable. She declined a complete rectal exam thus
difficult to determine the source of bleeding: fissure vs
further in the GI tract.

Upon arrival to the floor the patient had severe pain at the
anus and then passed another large clot witnessed by the nursing
staff and hospitalist on-call.  Most recent vitals: 58, 130/45,
15, 97% 2L afebrile.

SIGMOIDOSCOPY [**2133-6-1**]:
Severe colitis. Clot with possible visible vessel; clipped with
good success. Fissure site without evidence of bleeding. At 25
cm, severe ulceration was noted and lumen was difficult to find.
The appearance was concerning for a possible perforation,
although no definite perforation was seen. Diverticulosis of the
sigmoid. Otherwise normal sigmoidoscopy to 25 cm

Brief Hospital Course:
This is an 87-year-old woman with psoriatic arthritis, chronic
recurrent PEs on lifelong coumadin s/p recent fissurectomy and
severe, active colitis, who is admitted to the hospital with
lower GI bleed.  The patient initially admitted to the floor,
but very quickly transferred to the ICU because of active LGIB
and falling hematocrit.  One unit of FFP and one unit of PRBC
were given.  Sigmoidoscopy performed on Hospital Day 2 revealed
severe colitis, fresh blood clot with possible visible vessel.
Vessel was clipped and bleeding controlled.  Anticoagulation was
stopped and reveresed.  IVC filter (removable type) placed on
[**2133-6-2**].  Treatment for IBD escalated to IV solumedrol.

PROBLEM LIST:
LOWER GI BLEED:  Likely secondary to ulcers from IBD.  Mr.
[**Known lastname 9035**] with BRBPR and passing clots.  Peripheral access was
obtained, and patient was treated with IVF and blood
transfusions prn to maintain a hct >25.  GI and surgery were
consulted; on [**6-1**], surgery performed a sigmoidoscopy and
clipped a clot with possible visible vessel.  Patient's bleeding
resolved and she remained hemodynamically stable.

ACTIVE COLITIS:  Patient was treated with cipro and liquid
prednisone as an outpatient with good effect.  Sigmoidoscopy
performed during this hospitalization shows ulcerations and
erythema consistent with active colitis.  GI recommended
increasing steroi
