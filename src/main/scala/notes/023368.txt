HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 27-year-old obese mans
with a history of asthma and recent episodes of pneumonia who
presents with two weeks of productive cough, diaphoresis, and
fatigue.

The patient has asthma since childhood characterized by daily
albuterol and Flovent, prior hospitalization x5 (last
hospitalization 14 years ago), no intubations, peak flow of 400,
and dyspnea on one-block exertion, and cold weather.

Patient was in his usual state of health until one month prior to
admission when he developed sharp right sided chest pain on
inspiration and cough productive of yellow sputum. He was seen in
the Emergency Department and found to have a right middle lobe
infiltrate on chest x-ray.  The patient was discharged with a
diagnosis of pneumonia with asthma exacerbation, given a five day
course of azithromycin.

After completion of this treatment, his cough resolved and
radiography demonstrated clearance of the opacity, though he
reports "feeling only slightly better."

Over the next two weeks, he reported worsening productive
cough with hemoptysis, intermittent fevers (unmeasured), and
chills.  He presented to the Emergency Department one week
prior to admission with these symptoms and was given another
five day course of azithromycin after chest x-ray was read as
negative.  A PPD was also planted, which was read negative in
[**Hospital 191**] clinic four days later.

Since completion of the azithromycin, patient has noticed
increased dyspnea on exertion and worsening of his cough,
which is productive for yellow sputum with no blood.  On the
morning of admission, his mother found him to have worsened
cough with heavy diaphoresis and brought him into the
Emergency Department.

A multi-system review is notable for intermittent fevers,
chills, fatigue, and wheezes.  He is compliant with his
medications, the only recent change being a decrease of
gabapentin from 400 mg qid to 400 mg [**Hospital1 **].

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  As above.  In addition, the patient notes
no chest pain, no palpitations, no paroxysmal nocturnal
dyspnea/orthopnea, no nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, no
dysuria/hematuria.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient's vital signs are
temperature of 99.3, blood pressure of 130/88 supine, pulse
of 104, respiratory rate of 22, and an oxygen saturation of
83% on room air which improved to 91% on 2 liters nasal
cannula, and nebulizers x1.  In general, the patient is a
young obese ill-appearing man who seems sleepy and
diaphoretic.  Integument:  Cold, dry; no rashes or
ulcerations, normal pigmentation, no jaundice.  HEENT:  His
head is normocephalic, atraumatic, without scalp lesions;
eyes:  Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light and
accommodation.  Extraocular movements are intact.  Mucous
membranes moist.  Ears - No tenderness or discharge; nose -
no erythema, obstruction, discharge, no sinus tenderness;
throat - no lesions or ulcerations; normal tonsils, uvula,
palate, oropharynx not injected.  Neck:  Supple; thyroid
normal in size without palpable masses or nodules. Lymph
nodes:  No palpable cervical or ancillary nodes.  Chest:
Percussion difficult to assess secondary to obesity,
localized wheezes right greater than left, decreased breath
sounds at the bases bilaterally left greater than right, and
no crackles noted on inspiration or expiration.
Cardiovascularly, no jugular venous distention, PMI palpable;
normal S1, S2 without murmurs, rubs, or gallops.  Abdomen:
Obese, normoactive bowel sounds, soft, nontender,
nondistended; liver palpable five cm down the midclavicular
line.  No guarding, no rebound.  Extremities:  No clubbing,
cyanosis, or edema; pedal pulses 2+ bilaterally.
Neurological:  CNS grossly intact.  Alert and oriented times
three.

STUDIES:  Laboratory results are significant for a white
blood cell count of 13.4 with 48 neutrophils, 14 bands, 23
lymphocytes, 9 monocytes, 4 eosinophils, and 2 basophils; a
hematocrit of 41.3, and a platelet count of 594.  His
chemistries were notable for a sodium of 143, a potassium of
4.5, chloride of 100, a bicarb of 30, BUN 9, and creatinine
0.7, ALT elevated at 91, and AST at 44.

An electrocardiogram demonstrated normal sinus rhythm at 100
beats per minute with normal intervals and normal axis; there
were nonspecific T-wave inversions in lead V1.

A chest x-ray in the Emergency Department showed interval
development of a patchy opacity at the left lung base and a
small left sided effusion.


HOSPITAL COURSE:

1. Pulmonary - The patient was admitted and empirically treated
for community acquired pneumonia with levofloxacin 500 mg q day
and q6 nebulizers for questioned component of asthma.  A sputum
culture demonstrated betalactimase negative Hemophilus influenza.
On the second day of admission, he was found to be increasingly
somnolent and less responsive.  An arterial blood gas showed
hypercarbia with a pH of 7.25, pCO2 of 87, and a pO2 of 79.

The patient was then transferred to the unit secondary to
decreased respiratory drive, where he was intubated later that
evening after developing acute respiratory failure.  He was
extubated two days later after his breathing stabilized and then
transferred back to our service on 4 liters of oxygen.

In the unit, he was also started on high dose IV steroids and
then switched to oral prednisone for taper.  His examination
on readmission to the service was improved with decreased
fatigue, decreased diaphoresis, and a improved chest x-ray
notable for decreased wheezing.  Over the next two days, his
symptoms continued improving with continued steroid taper q6
naps and levofloxacin therapy.  He was then weaned off of the
oxygen and had O2 saturations of 93-95% on room air prior to
discharge.

During the hospitalization, he had a negative lower extremity
noninvasive study that did not show any deep venous
thromboses, a lung scan that showed low probability for
pulmonary embolism and an echocardiogram that demonstrated
normal left ventricular function with no valvular
abnormalities or pericardial effusion.  On discharge, he will
follow up with Pulmonary Clinic, pulmonary function tests
laboratories, and sleep laboratory as an outpatient.

2. Hypertension:  In the setting of acute respiratory failure
and established history of asthma, Inderal was discontinued
after hospital day #2.  His blood pressure was well
controlled on Lasix 40 mg po q day while in the hospital, and
then he was also given diltiazem 30 mg po qid for rate
control.

On the last day of admission, he required potassium
supplementation, [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 233**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1002**] in the setting of a potassium down
to 3.3.

3. Endocrine:  The patient was f
