Service: CARDIOTHORACIC

Allergies:
Advil / Aspirin

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 165**]
Chief Complaint:
Intermittent bradycardia, hypoxia, chest pain with TWI and trop
leak in setting of infective endocarditis


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2124-7-2**]
1. Aortic valve replacement with a size 23-mm St. [**Male First Name (un) 923**]
mechanical valve.
2. Mitral valve replacement with a size 31 St. [**Male First Name (un) 923**] mechanical
valve.


History of Present Illness:
28 yo M with PMH of IVDU, and aortic valve infective
endocarditis admitted with infective endocarditis.  He is
transferred to the CCU for more monitoring in setting of
worsened hypoxia, altered mental status and intermittent
hypotension/bradycardia thought to be vagal in nature.
.
He was admitted here on [**6-26**] after a 3 day stay at an OSH.  The
day prior to that he presented to his PCP and found to have a 7
point hct drop 31--->24 and was referred to an OSH ED. There, he
has no elevation if WBC but had a 7% bandemia and blood cultures
grew out strep.  He was positive for cocain as well. After his
blood cultures turned positive, he was transferred here for
further care as there had been plan for valve replacement with
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 65483**].
.
Of note, his last episode of infective endocarditis was in the
fall of [**2123**] and was treated with 3 months of iv antibiotics
(unknown type). He had previously been on IV abx (unclear which
kind for 3 months
.
Since admission here, he has been doing well and had been
treated with ceftriaxone and gentamycin.  ID has been following.
 Blood cultures here have been negative.
.
He has been continued on his cardiac medications and received
diuresis for fluid overload with lasix thought to be from his
severe MR.  Repeat echo here showed 4+ MR, 4+ AI, EF 65% with
1cm vegetations on both the aoritic and mitral valves.  There
was also a likely vegetation attached to the left atrial wall in
the region of the warfarin ridge.  Finally, the aortic root
appeared thickened concerning for an abscess/phlegmon.
.
CT surgery was consulted given wide open MV and AV on echo.
Though there is CT surgery note from this admission, per intern
notes, recommendation was antibiotics, out pt drug rehab and
goal of being drug free for 6 months prior to consideration for
valve replacement.
.
He had been doing well since admission until last night at 10pm
when he became anxious, reported chest pain. Also had 2 episodes
of bradycardia to high 30's which resolved without intervention
and tele showed ? junctional rhythm. EKG showed TWI in the
precordial leads.  The overnight team spoke with the cardiology
fellow who felt that this was unlikely to be heart block as it
resolved with no intervention.  Felt to be vagal and likely
related to anxiety and he received ativan 1mg iv and he felt
better. Cardiac enzymes were sent and trop was 0.37 and CK/MB
were normal.  Felt to likely be a coronary septic emboli and
systemic anticoagulation is not favored given high risk of CNS
emboli and converstion to hemorrhage.  CT head was negative
though MRI was recommended for complete rule out of emboli.
.
At 6am this morning, he triggered for tachypnia, hypoxia to mid
80's on room air.  He noted to be diaphoretic and with chest
pain.  See trigger note for full details.  He was again
bradycardic, with BP's in the 100's, hypoxia to mid 80's on room
air which reoslved to 2L nc.  EKG showed deeper TWI in
precordial leads and TWI in inferior leads. Repeat trop down
trended to 0.32 and CK/MB normal.  Cr increased to 1.6 and Na
down to 130.  Lactate was 3. There was concern that he had
friends visiting the evening before and that he could have used
an illicit drug.  A room search was done and suboxone/naloxone
combo pills were found.  Pill count showed an appropriate number
of pills.  Urine and serum tox were negative.

Cardiac surgery consulted for urgent surgical correction.

.
Echo [**6-30**]: The left atrium is dilated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The right ventricular cavity is dilated
with depressed free wall contractility. There is abnormal septal
motion/position consistent with right ventricular
pressure/volume overload. The aortic root is mildly dilated at
the sinus level. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened
with probable vegetation (~1cm diameter). The aortic root is
irregularly thickened consistent with aortic phelgmon/abscess.
Severe (4+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened with large perforation of the
anterior leaflet. There is a large (~1.7 cm) vegetation on the
mitral valve attached to the anterior leaflet in the region of
the perforation. Severe (4+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There
is a moderate sized vegetation (~1.2 cm) attached to the left
atrial wall in the region of the warfarin ridge. The tricuspid
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is severe pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. The pulmonic valve leaflets are
thickened. There is a very small pericardial effusion.

In addition to the above vegetations, at least one additional
vegetation (~0.6 cm diameter) is noted attached to the anterior
mitral valve leaflet.

Compared with the prior report (images unavailable) of
[**2124-6-27**], findings are similar. The mitral valve vegetation
appears slightly larger.

[**2124-7-2**] TEE
Conclusions
Prebypass

No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body of the left
atrium or left atrial appendage. There is a small vegetation
seen on the coumadin ridge. No atrial septal defect is seen by
2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are
normal. The left ventricular cavity is moderately dilated.
Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF=45-50%).
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more
depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.] The
right ventricular cavity is dilated with mild global free wall
hypokinesis. The ascending, transverse and descending thoracic
aorta are normal in diameter and free of atherosclerot
