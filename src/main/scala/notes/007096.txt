electrical cardioversion


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 34366**] is a 79 y.o. Male w/ h.o. RA, mild AS, HTN, HL p/w
chest palpitations found to be in A. flutter.
.
Pt is a poor historian. He states that 2 days ago he noted a
fluttering sensation in his chest, he denied any chest pain but
stated it felt like he had an itch in his chest. He also noted
some new onset DOE specifically when climbing up stairs. He
states he has had these symptoms before, several years ago, but
cannot remember what it was thought to be. He decided to make an
appointment to see his [**Hospital1 **] primary care provider on the day
of admission. Per ED call-in he was noted to be on EKG in SVT
with a rate of 180, saturating 94% on 2L. He was then
transferred by ambulance to the ED.
.
In the ED initial VS were noted to be T 98.1, HR 139, BP 108/81,
RR 17, Sat 97% on 4L. He was triggered on arrival for his
tachycardia. An EKG showed a rate of 140s which was thought to
be SVT vs A. flutter. He was given 20mg IV Diltiazem which
decreased his rate from 140s to 80s-90s where an A. flutter
rhythm was seen. His BP also decreased to the high 70s/low 80s.
Per the [**Name (NI) **] pt was asymptomatic, he was given IV fluid with his
pressure increasing back to 100. His initial labs were notable
for proBNP 7509, Hgb/Hct 13.2/38.6, Lactate 1.8, CK/CKMB/CKMBI
321/14/4.4, Troponin 0.05. A CXR showed cardiomegaly and a right
pleural effusion,he was thus given empirical Levofloxacin 750mg
IV x 1. In the ED he continued to intermittently increase his HR
back in the 130s, he was Metoprolol 25mg PO x 1, and 5mg IV
Metoprolol. Atrius cardiologist was consulted, given his low
pressures ED felt he should be admitted to the CCU. He was
guaiac negative in the ED.
.
On the floor pt continues to be in the 130s, SBP 110s but
asymptomatic. He denies any chest pain, fevers, chills, nausea,
vomiting, cough, abdominal pain. He does admit to feeling some
sensation of fluttering in his chest but it does not bother him
currently. He denies SOB.

Pertinent Results:
.
ECG [**2170-1-18**]: Wide complex tachycardia suggestive of
supraventricular tachycardia with aberrancy in a right
bundle-branch block pattern. No previous tracing available for
comparison.
.
ECG [**2170-1-18**]: Atrial tachycardia is suggested with right
bundle-branch block. Left anterior fascicular block.
.
ECG [**2170-1-19**]: Atrial flutter with right bundle-branch block.
Left anterior fascicular block pattern.
.
ECG [**2170-1-20**]: Supraventricular tachy-arrhythmia which could be
sinus or ectopic atrial, etc. Compared to the previous tracing
of [**2170-1-19**] isolated atrial ectopy is not seen.
.
ECG [**2170-1-21**]: Baseline artifact precludes definite assessment
of rhythm which could be atrial tachy-arrhythmia with 2:1 or 1:1
conduction. Sinus tachycardia is less likely. Compared to the
previous tracing of [**2170-1-20**] supraventricular tachy-arrhythmia is
again noted.
.
ECG [**2170-1-22**]: Sinus rhythm with frequent atrial premature
beats. Possible multifocal atrial tachycardia. Leftward axis.
Right bundle-branch block. Since the previous tracing of [**2170-1-21**]
the rate is slower and the rhythm is more irregular. ST-T wave
abnormalities are less prominent.
.
ECHO [**2170-1-19**]
No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of
the left atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of the right
atrium/right atrial appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen
by 2D or color Doppler. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is severely depressed (LVEF= 15-20 %). There are simple
atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. Aortic stenosis is likely
present (not quantified). No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate (2+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial effusion.
.
IMPRESSION: No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus in the
atria/ atrial appendages. Severely depressed global left
ventricular systolic function. Aortic stenosis (not quantified
on current study). Moderate mitral regurgitation.
.
ECHO [**2170-1-22**]
The left atrium is elongated. The right atrium is moderately
dilated. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
The estimated right atrial pressure is 10-15mmHg. Left
ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular
cavity is moderately dilated. There is severe global left
ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 25 %). No masses or thrombi are
seen in the left ventricle. There is no ventricular septal
defect. The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with
moderate global free wall hypokinesis. The aortic valve leaflets
are moderately thickened. Significant aortic stenosis is present
(not quantified). No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary
artery systolic pressure could not be determined. There is no
pericardial effusion.
.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**1-20**]/201, the
LV systolic funciton is slightly more vigorous.
.
HEPATIC ULTRASOUND WITH DOPPLER [**2170-1-22**]
IMPRESSION:
1. The hepatic architecture is unremarkable and there are no
liver lesions
identified.
2. Patent hepatic vasculature.


Brief Hospital Course:
HOSPITAL COURSE:
Mr. [**Known lastname 34366**] is a 79 year-old gentleman with aortic stenosis,
hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and rheumatoid arthritis who
presented with atrial fib/flutter and acute systolic heart
failure. Electrical cardioversion was attempted twice and
ultimately failed. He was started on [**Known lastname **], Digoxin,
Metoprolol and diuresed with a Lasix gtt. His hospital course
was complicated by hypotension, acute kidney injury, and
transaminitis, which have resolved. He was diagnosed with a
catheter-associated UTI prior to discharge. He is being
discharged to a rehab facility for continued strength building.
.
ACTIVE ISSUES:
# ATRIAL FIB/FLUTTER: The patient presented in atrial flutter
with a variant block from 2-4:1 of unclear onset or duration.
Thyroid function was normal. He received diltiazem in the
emergency department with initial rate control, but subsequently
became hypotensive. He was started on metoprolol for rate
control, anticoagulated with a heparin gtt and transferred to
the cardiac ICU. TEE/ablation was attempted; however, only
cardioversion was performed because the patient's O2 saturations
acutely dropped during the TEE, likely secondary to pulmonary
edema. The patient remained in sinus rhythm for less than 2
hours before flipping back into atrial flutter. He was started
on [**Known lastname **] and
