History of Present Illness:
85 yo man with several recent hospitalizations for gallstone
pancreatitis who was admitted to an OSH [**8-14**] with blood-loss
anemia and renal failure. Recent PMHx begins in late [**6-24**] when
he was admitted here with gallstone pancreatitis. ERCP was
attempted but they could not cannulate the CBD; symptoms
improved with supportive care and the pt was d/c home after one
week. Sx recurred in mid-[**7-25**] when he was admitted to an OSH.
There he was felt to need a ccy and so was sent here, where an
ERCP was repeated and the CBD cannulated with sphincterotomy and
stone extraction; duodenal ulcers were also incidentally noted
during this study. A CT scan showed ? non-enhancing lesion at
the head of the pancreas (necrotizing pancreatitis vs.
pseudocyst). His hospital course was c/b MRSA bacteremia found
on routine blood cxs [**7-28**]. A subsequent TEE was equivocal (debris
with calcifications vs. vegetations), so the plan was made for
empiric treatment of endocarditis with vanco x6 weeks through a
LUE PICC. The pt was ultimately discharged from the [**Hospital1 18**] on
[**8-5**] to a NH. There he was getting vanco [**Hospital1 **] for 7-8 days, also
prn Lasix for LE edema. He was sent in to an OSH [**8-13**] with a Cr
of 4.4 (baseline 1.4), Hct 25 (baseline 30). His anemia was
thought to likely be multifactorial (PUD vs. LGIB vs. renal
failure). He was initially given two unit pRBCs with an
appropriate response. His FeNa there was c/w pre-renal azotemia
in the setting of total body volume overload. His meds renally
dosed and his diuretics were held due to presumed intravascular
volume depletion. Despite low-salt albumin and the pRBC
transfusions noted above, his creatinine had increased to 6.0 on
the day prior to transfer here. He has also been oliguric
(200-400 cc/day for 5-6 days prior to transfer), and he has
developed hyperkalemia and pulmonary edema.  Discussions were
held with the patient and his family regarding the initiation of
hemodialysis, and ultimately the decision was made to pursue a
trial of hemodialysis. He is therefore transferred here for
initiation of hemodialysis.

Of note, the patient has reportedly also had progressive
abdominal distension  over the [**Last Name (un) 18712**] 1-2 weeks. A KUB done at the
OSH on the day prior to transfer was suggestive of a partial
SBO. At no point, however, has he had n/v or abd pain. He is
having bowel movement and passing flatus, and he is tolerating a
po diet. His lipase and amylase were also increasing, thus
raising the question of recurrent pancreatitis.  For these
reasons, he was made NPO on the night prior to transfer.

Brief Hospital Course:
85 yo man with several recent hospitalizations for gallstone
pancreatitis now transferred from OSH with acute renal failure.

1. Acute Renal Failure: Cr of 6.0 on admission markedly elevated
from prior baseline of 1.2. Differential initially included
intravascular volume depletion vs. ATN (contrast nephropathy?)
vs. medication toxicity. OSH FeNa of 0.8% was c/w pre-renal
etiology. Pt was total-body volume overload. This gradually
improved with hemo dilysis. As the admission progressed, renal
felt etiology more likely to be cholesterol emboli. Renal US was
done which ruled out obstructive etiology. Renal consult was
obtained on admission and hemo dialysis was initiated. Pt was
stabalized on a Mon-Wed-Fri regimen. Decision was made not to
persue a renal biopsy as pt and family did not want any invasive
procedures. Hemodialysis became increasingly challenging
secondary to hypotension. On [**2103-9-1**], family decided not to
continue with dialysis.

2. Pancreatitis/Pseudocyst: Enzymes mildly elevated on admission
([**Doctor First Name **] 197, lipase 116). Noncontrast CT of abdomen was obtained
which was concerning for a pancreatic pseudocyst. Surgery was
initially consulted but did not feel surgical intervention was
warrented. Pt was initially kept NPO with a NG tube and TPN for
nutrition. However, he self discontined the NG tube on
[**2105-7-23**]. On [**2105-7-26**], the pt developed increased abdominal
pain on exam. Abdominal film was unremarkable. After extensive
discussion with the pt and family, they decided not to persue
further imaging including CT scan or MRCP. They declined any
invasive intervention no matter the cause of abdominal pain. At
that time, the TPN was discontinued. Pt was allowed to eat as
desired with a pureed diet. However, he took little by mouth. Pt
was covered throughout the admission with meropenem and was
discontinued on the day of discharge.

5. Pneumonia: Unclear diagnosis at OSH, although there was a
question of bibasilar infiltrates on admission CXR. He was
treated with ceftriaxone and flagyl.  He is currently
comfortable on room air with prn nebulizer treatments for
audible wheezing.

5. Anemia: Lab panel at OSH c/w anemia of chronic disease. Hct
stable here.

7. MRSA Bacteremia: Patient was treated with vancomycin dosed by
level and was maintained on contact precautions. Vancomycin was
discontinued when pt was made CMO as levels were no longer
obtained.

8. VRE: Likely simply colonization of urinary tract.

9. Access: LUE PICC, dialysis catheter

10. F/E/N: POs as tolerated.

11. Communication: With wife and daughter.

12. Code: DNR/DNI. CMO sta
