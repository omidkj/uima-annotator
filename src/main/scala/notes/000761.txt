History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 78 year old female with a remote history of lung
cancer s/p lobectomy, COPD on 2L at baseline, type II diabetes
and hypertension who presents from [**Hospital 100**] Rehab with shortness
of breath. Per notes over the past weekend she developed upper
respiratory tract symptoms with nasal congestion, and cough
productive of thick sputum. She was not experiencing any fevers.
She was given increased nebulizer treatments with some relief.
She was not experiencing chest pain or pleuritic type pain. She
was not experiencing nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain,
constipation, dysuria, hematuria, leg pain or swelling. She does
endorse some mild diarrhea. She says that her breathing has been
getting progressively worse over the past three days despite
increasing nebulizer and oxygen therapy (titrated to 4L). She
appeared progressively worse and EMS was called for transport to
[**Hospital1 18**]. When EMS arrived she was complaining of shortness of
breath. Initial oxygen saturations were in the low 80s and these
improved to 94% on a non-rebreather. She was noted to have scant
wheezes in her upper lung fields. EKG showed sinus tachycardia,
right bundle branch block, q waves in III, avF, TWF V1-V3. She
was taken to the emergency room.
.
In the ED, initial vs were: T: 98.8 P: 113 BP: 130/84 R: 25 O2
sat: 85% on RA. Initial CXR showed possible infiltrate in the L
upper lobe. EKG showed sinus tachycardia, left axis, right
bundle branch block, TWI V1-V3, q waves III, avF, no change
compared to prior earlier in the day. She received vancomycin 1
gram IV x 1, zosyn 4.5 grams x 1, combivent nebulizers x 3,
solumedrol 125 mg IV x 1. She was placed on BIPAP with mild
improvement. She also received nitroglycerine for potential
volume overload as well as lasix 20 mg IV x 1. Her BNP was
elevated at 1122. Her WBC was 15.1 with 91% neutrophils. She had
one set of negative cardiac enzymes. She was admitted to the
intensive care unit for further management.
.
On arrival to the ICU she reported that her shortness of breath
has improved somewhat from this morning. She denied fevers,
chills, chest pain, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain,
constipation, dysuria, hematuria, leg pain or swelling. Comes
from rehab. Has had recent rhinorrhea and productive cough
without fevers. Mild diarrhea at rehab. All other review of
systems negative in detail.

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 78 year old female with a history of lung cancer s/p
lobectomy, COPD on two liters at baseline, insulin dependent
diabetes, hypertension who presents with rhinorrhea, cough and
shortness of breath likely due to COPD exacerbation and
multifocal pneumonia.

Cough/Shortness of Breath: Questionable small infiltrate in left
upper lung field in setting of low grade fevers, leukocytosis,
and upper respiratory tract symptoms. Likely represents
exacerbation of patients known COPD in the setting of possible
viral versus bacterial lung infection. There may be a component
of volume overload although no clear cardiac history. Started on
vancomycin, zosyn and levofloxacin for HCAP as coming from rehab
facility and titrated from BIPAP to 4 liters nasal cannula in
ICU. Urine legionella negative. Influenza DFA was negative.
Solumedrol weaned to prednisone for possible COPD exacerbation
with plan for quick taper, which was completed while patient was
in house. Ruled out for MI. Patient was started on vancomycin,
zosyn and levofloxacin x 7 day course (D1 = [**2188-6-2**] for
Vancomycin and Zosyn and D1 = [**2188-6-6**] for Levofloxacin.) Blood
cultures were negative for growth at discharge. On the floor,
patient had an episode of persistent hypoxia to 85% on oxygen
likely in the setting of delerium that was relieved with ativan
and anti-psychotics.  She was satting >90% on discharge, but
still had evidence of multifocal pneumonia on CXR and expiratory
wheezes on exam.

COPD: On 2L nasal cannula at baseline. Started on solumedrol and
standing ipratropium and albuterol nebs for likely exacerbation.
Finished a quick prednisone taper given emotional lability. O2
sats were titrated sats 88-92%
.
Acute Renal Failure:  Baseline of 0.9-1.0 as of 10/[**2186**].
Creatinine up to 1.9 this morning from 1.2 on presentation.
Likely prerenal in the setting of infection and decreased PO
intake.  Differential diagnosis includes ATN v. AIN with zosyn.
Urine eosinophils negative. Patient was hydrated with normal
saline. Creatinine improved from 1.9 to 1.6. Hydration was
changed to 1/2 normal saline in the setting of mild
hypernatremia. Her lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide were held.
All medications were re
