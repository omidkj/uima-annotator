Service:  MEDICINE

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:   The patient is a 54-year-old
woman who was diagnosed with lung cancer in [**2155**] and is
status post radiation treatment, no chemotherapy or surgical
treatment.  She was admitted to an outside hospital on
[**2166-11-19**], with increased shortness of breath.  At
that time, she was treated with Levaquin and Solu-Medrol.
She was also started on dopamine for hypotension.  The
patient required intubation for hypoxemia.  She was then
transferred to [**Hospital1 69**] on
[**2166-11-22**], for further management of what was felt to
be a post-obstructive pneumonia.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:   The patient's history is notable for
lung cancer diagnosed in [**2155**], status post radiation therapy.
She has a history of pleural effusions.  She is status post
pericardial window in [**2164-8-8**].  Also status post
pleural biopsy done in [**2166-10-9**], which was positive
for adenocarcinoma.  She also has chronic pericardial
effusions, thought to be secondary to radiation therapy.

ALLERGIES:   Sulfa.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1.  Ceftazidime 1 gram every eight hours
2.  Unasyn 3 grams intravenously every eight hours
3.  Solu-Medrol 60 mg intravenously every 12 hours

FAMILY HISTORY:   Unremarkable.

SOCIAL HISTORY:   Significant for continued smoking.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:   On admission, temperature was 97.9,
heart rate 16, blood pressure 99/50, respiratory rate 20.
The patient was on dopamine 8 mcg/kg/minute and morphine 3
mg/hour.  She was awake, somnolent, following simple
commands, intermittently confused.  Her pupils were equal,
round and reactive to light.  Her chest examination revealed
scattered rhonchi.  Her heart examination was regular, with
normal S1 and a physiologically split S2, no S3 or S4, and a
soft systolic murmur at the upper left sternal border.  Her
abdomen was soft, with bowel sounds present but hypoactive.
Neurologically, she was awake and following simple commands.

LABORATORY DATA:   Significant for a white count of 21.8,
hematocrit of 32.2, and platelet count of 306.  Her
laboratories were otherwise remarkable for an arterial blood
gas with a pH of 7.40, a PCO2 of 53, and a PO2 of 87.

Chest x-ray showed normal heart size, bilateral pleural
effusions, right perihilar mass, patchy infiltrates.

Electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia at 108 beats per
minute, with left axis deviation, low limb voltages, and no
ischemic changes.

HOSPITAL COURSE:   The overall impression is of a 54-year-old
woman with Stage IV lung cancer and a post-obstructive
pneumonia.

1.  Lung cancer:  The patient has Stage IV lung cancer with
pleural metastases diagnosed by biopsy on [**2166-11-7**],
which revealed adenocarcinoma.  On [**11-24**], she underwent
bronchoscopy which revealed near-total tumor obstruction of
the right upper lobe and right middle lobe, and on CT was
found to have partial collapse of the right middle lobe and
right upper lobe.  The patient was intubated for this
procedure, and she was self-extubated on [**11-25**], which
she tolerated well.  However, she was reintubated prior to an
attempt to stent the obstruction and ablate the tumor with
lasers.  This procedure, however, was not successful.  After
discussion with the patient and the patient's family, it was
decided to make her code status comfort measures only after
she was transferred home to [**Location (un) 26833**].  [**Location (un) **]
transportation was arranged.

2.  Pneumonia:  The patient was felt to have a
post-obstructive pneumonia. She was initially admitted on
Unasyn and ceftazidime.  The ceftazidime was discontinued.
The patient was also admitted on Solu-Medrol, and this was
tapered over her hospital stay.

3.  Pericardial effusions:  The patient had an echocardiogram
performed on [**11-25**], which revealed small pericardial
effusion but no tamponade physiology.  This was unchanged
from many previous echocardiograms.

4.  Hypotension:  The patient was maintained on dopamine
drip.  The etiology of her hypotension was unclear.  She had
negative blood cultures and a negative urinalysis, suggesting
that this was most likely not sepsis.  However, the patient
on admission had a Swan-Ganz catheter placed, which revealed
a systemic vascular resistance of 1121 on dopamine, right
atrial pressure of 10, right ventricular pressure of 30/10, a
PA pressure of 30/20, and a pulmonary capillary wedge
pressure of 12.

The patient was given intravascular volume and her pneumonia
was treated, however, she remained hypotensive, requiring
dopamine on discharge.

5.  Change in mental status:  The patient was confused and
agitated for much of her admission.  Following the first
bronchoscopy, the patient self-extubated herself, which she
initially tolerated well.  Following the second bronchoscopy,
the patient again self-extubated herself and removed her
central line.  She required four-point restraints at this
point, and was given Haldol.  She is discharged on Haldol 5
mg four times a day with good effect.  A CT scan of the brain
was performed to rule out brain metastases, and this scan was
negative.

6.  Code status:  It was decided that the patient would
remain full code until she returned home to [**Location (un) 26833**],
however, the patient and the patient's family feel that she
would like to be comfort measures only when she returns home.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:   The patient is returning home to
[**Location (un) 26833**] via [**Location (un) **].

DISCHARGE STATUS:  The patient is discharged in fair
condition.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Stage IV lung cancer (adenocarcinoma)
2.  Post-obstructive pneumonia
3.  Hypotension

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Solu-Medrol 10 mg intravenously every 12 hours
2.  Dopamine 0-20 mcg/kg/minute titrate to mean arterial
pressure greater than 60
3.  Unasyn 3 grams intravenously every six hours
4.  Protonix 40 mg intravenously once daily
5.  Haldol 5 mg by mouth every six hours
