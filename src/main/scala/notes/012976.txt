Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 6359**] was admitted and underwent cardiac catheterization.
Coronary angiography revealed a right dominant system and normal
coronary arteries. Hematology evaluation was performed. Findings
were consistent with CLL. He was otherwise cleared by the
hematology service. No treatment for his possible CLL was
recommended at this time. On [**8-31**], Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 914**]
performed mini-maze procedure. For surgical details, please see
seperate dictated operative note. Following the operation, he
was brought to the CVICU for invasive monitoring. Within 24
hours, he awoke neurologically intact and was extubated without
incident. On postoperative day one, he transferred to the SDU.
He remained in a normal sinus rhythm. Beta blockade and Warfarin
were resumed and titrated accordingly. Over several days, he
continued to make clinical improvements and was discharged to
home on postoperative day four. He will follow up with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 914**] as directed.
