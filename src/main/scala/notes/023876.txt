Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2962**]
Chief Complaint:
Dizziness, weakness

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:

ICD Placement


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is an 81 y.o. male with known CAD s/p CABG in [**2109**],
h/o ischemic cardiomyopathy with EF 25% s/p NSTEMI and BMS to
RCA in [**12-11**], DM, and HTN who presents to the ED with dizziness
and weakness beginning this AM.  He has been feeling fatigued
for approximately one month, however this AM felt profoundly
weak to the point where he was unable to get up from his chair.
When he was able to get up he experienced dizziness which is
unusual for him.  This symptom resolved when he sat back down.
He also experienced shortness of breath with minimal activity,
like taking off his robe.  He took 2 SL NTG which did not change
or relieve his symptoms.  He did not experience any chest pain,
syncope or presyncope.  At baseline he lives alone and ambulates
without difficulty around the house.  He has bilateral knee pain
and therefore is not able to walk long distances.  Of note, he
did not take his medications this morning.
.
When EMS arrived on the scene he was found to have a HR of 27.
He received [**2-4**] amp of atropine with HR response to the 50s.  On
arrival to the ED HR was again in the 20s, BP 152/60, O2 sat
100% on 2L.  Electrophysiology was consulted in the ED and found
him to have high grade AV block.  Blood pressure remained stable
with systolic BP in the 140s-160s.  In the ED, he was given an
additional 1mg of atropine without change in HR.  A digoxin
level was checked and was 0.2.  First set of cardiac enzymes
were negative.  On arrival to the CVICU he is awake, alert and
conversing with his family.
.
On review of symptoms, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, hemoptysis, black stools or red
stools.  He did have the "flu" one week ago.  His main symptoms
were fatigue, cough, and occasional chills.  No fevers since
that time.  He has bilateral knee discomfort which is stable.
He denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other
review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for (-) chest pain,
(+)dyspnea on exertion, (-)paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, (+) 2
pillow orthopnea, (+) ankle edema, (-) palpitations, (-)syncope
or (-)presyncope.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is an 81 year old male with history of CAD s/p CABG,
CHF (EF 20%), DM, HTN who presented to ED c/o dizziness and was
found to have high degree AV block.
.
# Rhythm: Admitted with high degree AV block, type II, 2nd
degree block.  Pt had a  history of LBBB and prolonged PR
interval.  The etiology of the patient's bradycardia included
medication induced (dig level is 0.2, atenolol is renally
cleared) vs scar (old infarct and LBBB) vs ischemia (baseline
LBBB).  The most likely etiology was felt to be a diseased
His-Purkinje for old scar.  Ischemia was ruled out with cardiac
enzymes and EKG.  Pt was admitted and pacer pads were kept in
place and atropine was kept at the bedside.  Pt was monitor on
telemetry. Lytes were checked and repleted aggressively.  A RIJ
and transvenous pacer wire was placed after admission.  Digoxin
and nodal agents were held, and the folowing day had an escape
nodal rhythm when pacer tunred down to 50 but inconsistently so
(supporting a disease His-P system).  The plan was to place a
biv ICD which was attempted on day3 but LV lead was
unsuccessful.  EP decided this was sufficinet in this patient.
He was scheduled for an appointment in the device clinic one
week from d/c and was instructed to call Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for an
appointment to be seen within 1 mo.
.
# Ischemia: h/o CAD s/p CABG
Pt had no chest pain on admission or during course. MI ruled out
as above. ASA, statin, plavix were continued and BB, ACEi were
started after ICD placement.  Pt was sent out on Toprol XL 25mg
instead of Atenolol 50mg since pt had BP well controlled at this
dose in hospital on that BP regiment and atenolol we wanted to
avoid given renal insufficiency and possible atenolol toxicity.
Lisinopril was started at 5mg daily for post-MI, CHF with EF<40%
and for chronic renal insufficiency.  Imdur was kept at half
dose given initial fear of hypotension, then restarted at full
dose after ICD.
.
# Pump: Systolic heart failure with EF 20%
Pt arrived appearing mildly volume overloaded on exam. CXR with
some evidence of mild pulmonary vascular congestion.  Initially
continued half dose lasix given initial fear of hypotension
(home on Lasix 80mg daily).  After ICD placement started BB and
ACEi as above. Home lasix dose restarted at d/c.  he was
instructed to continue to take fluids but avoid salt.
.
# Renal Failure: Cr on admission 1.8, per report baseline Cr
1.1-1.3.  Elevation liekly was [**3-7**] poor forward flow from
bradycardia and improved rapidly when transvenous pacer was
placed. Creatinine was monitored daily. Improved cardiac output
as above with pacer. Creatinine on d/c was 1.3. Please recheck
as an outpt to assume stability.
.
# BPH:
- Continued terazosin.
.
# Glaucoma:
- Continued latanoprost ophtho drops.
.
# HTN: Currently well controlled.
- Held beta blocker initially. Then BB, ACEi, CCB, imdur as
above.
.
# DM:
- Insulin sliding scale in hosp with diabetic diet. Metformin
was restarted on d/c (given cr <1.5)
.
# FEN:
- Diabetic/ Heart healthy diet
- Monitored lytes and replete PRN
.
# Prophylaxis:
- PPI, bowel regimen, heparin subq
.
