Service:  Cardiothoracic Surgery

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient was admitted to the
hospital on [**2132-4-19**] to the [**Hospital Unit Name 196**] service with contraction
alkalosis from overdiuresis due to her decompensated
congestive heart failure and known mitral regurgitation.  Of
note, the patient was planned for a mitral valve repair on
[**2132-4-30**] but on that day was noted to be in flash
pulmonary edema.  The case was cancelled and she was admitted
to the coronary care unit for aggressive diuresis.  In the
coronary care unit she underwent aggressive diuresis with
Lasix and Diamox in preparation for her planned mitral valve
repair.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  1. Neurological:  Neurologically the
patient remained alert and oriented throughout her hospital
course however she was noted to have a fairly flat affect.
For this reason postoperatively a psychiatry consultation was
obtained.  The patient was restarted on her Celexa.  Her
narcotics and benzodiazepines were minimized and she remained
otherwise stable.

2. Cardiovascular:  Preoperatively the patient was diuresed
on the [**Hospital Unit Name 196**] service however she went into flash pulmonary
edema on [**4-30**] and was transferred to the coronary care unit
as noted above.  She was diuresed aggressively with Lasix and
Diamox and was noted on the 15th to be essentially euvolemic
without dyspnea.  Based on her history of severe
bronchiectasis, elective intubation was planned, which she
underwent on [**2132-5-2**] with bronchoscopy.  However she
subsequently developed septic physiology, spiking
temperatures requiring increasing pressor support and had a
PA catheter placed to guide her resuscitation and evaluate
her volume status.  She was maintained on Neo-Synephrine
which was eventually changed to dobutamine.  Due to her
pressor requirement, the decision was made for preoperative
intra-aortic balloon pump placement, which she underwent on
[**2132-5-5**].  She was continued on dobutamine with the IVP with
intermittent Levophed requirement.  She was eventually weaned
off.  Due to the patient's fevers preoperatively, she
required a 48-hour afebrile period before proceeding with her
surgery.  On [**5-6**] she was taken to the operating room for
mitral valve repair under general endotracheal anesthesia.
She had a 30 mm [**Doctor Last Name **] band placed around her mitral and
tricuspid valves.  She tolerated the procedure well with an
on-pump time of 83 minutes, cross-clamp time of approximately
36 minutes.  She was on Levophed and milrinone post procedure
and was transferred to the cardiac surgery recovery unit in
stable condition.  She was paced via her previously
indwelling DDD pacer postoperatively and actually experienced
hypertension postoperatively requiring a nitroglycerin drip.
Her intravenous pyelogram was discontinued without incident
on postoperative day number one.  Her nitroglycerin was
weaned off on postoperative day two.  She remained AV paced.
She was restarted on her captopril however her dose was
decreased to 6.25 from 12.5 due to hypotension.  She
otherwise remained hemodynamically stable throughout the
remainder of her postoperative course with good blood
pressure control on captopril.  She also was placed on Lasix
for postoperative diuresis and was down to her preoperative
weight without pedal or extremity edema at the time of
discharge.

3. Respiratory:  Due to the patient's known bronchiectasis as
noted above, elective intubation and bronchoscopy was
performed prior to her mitral valve repair.  However, she
spiked temperatures to 101 ranging to 103 and had a sputum
positive for Pseudomonas.  She was placed on empiric
antibiotic therapy for this.  Postoperatively she was
extubated on postoperative day two after bronchoscopy which
again revealed bronchiectasis with diffusely enlarged airways
and moderate thick opaque and copious secretions which were
aspirated at the time of the bronchoscopy.  Postoperatively
she underwent aggressive pulmonary toilet with q. 4 hour
chest physical therapy.  She was able to control her own
secretions but remained dependent on aggressive pulmonary
toilet and continued to have some baseline shortness of
breath which progressively improved.

4. GI:  She remained without significant issues with the
exception of poor p.o. intake which required encouragement to
take adequate p.o.  However she did tolerate a diet when she
did eat.

5. Renal:  She was diuresed postoperatively with good urine
output and no abnormalities in her BUN or creatinine.

6. Infectious disease:  Preoperatively the patient was on
Rifampin and ethambutol for atypical mycobacteria in her
sputum.  These were discontinued due to abnormal liver
function tests.  Infectious disease consultation was obtained
preoperatively and recommendations were made for empiric
ceftazidime and vancomycin which she was on perioperatively.
Additionally she was pancultured.  She had no positive blood
cultures and her sputum grew Pseudomonas which was resistant
to ciprofloxacin and yeast.  Due to her fevers preoperatively
her surgery was delayed and on [**5-6**] the patient had been
afebrile for 48 hours and was then deemed stable for surgery.
She was then continued on vancomycin and ceftazidime for a
brief postoperative course.  Her antibiotics were
discontinued and she remained afebrile with normal white
blood cell count.

7. Hematology:  She was restarted on her Coumadin for her
atrial fibrillation and at the time of discharge her INR was
2.6 after receiving daily doses of 2, 2 and 1 mg of Coumadin
with a goal INR of 2.0 to 2.5.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  The patient is currently
hemodynamically stable, being V paced with stable blood
pressure and heart rate, currently below her preoperative
weight and ready to go to rehabilitation from a
cardiovascular standpoint.  She does have a requirement for
aggressive pulmonary toilet.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  The patient will be discharged to the
[**Hospital **] rehabilitation facility.

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:
