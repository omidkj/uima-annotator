Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2485**]
Chief Complaint:
diarrhea, respiratory distress

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
endotracheal intubation

History of Present Illness:
68 y/o M with PMHx significant for COPD, CHF, HTN, C. diff
colitis who presents from home to ED with increased diarrhea x
24hrs. Patient was recently discharged from [**Hospital1 18**] to [**Hospital1 **] on
[**2150-5-3**] where he was found to have C. diff colitis and had just
completed course of flagyl. In the ED patient was noted to be
tachypneic and tachycardic. He also had some reported LLQ pain
and underwent CT abdomen which showed mild concentric wall
thickening of decensing colon and sigmoid colon consistent with
either infectious, inflammation or ischemic cause. He was given
dose of levofloxacin and flagyl in the ED. Patient lactate in
the ED was initially 2.0 and then 1.3 upon repeat. In the ED it
was felt that patient maybe getting tired so he was intubated,
his ABG after intubation was 7.29/47/484 then 7.27/47/118. He
underwent a CXR in the ED which was negative for pneumonia,
pulmonary edema, or pneumothorax. Patient got 10mg IV decadron
in the ED. After intubation patient became hypotensive and was
breifly on levophed gtt(approx 45 min), he was then transferred
to th ICU for further management. Of note in the ED cards was
contact[**Name (NI) **] about tachycardia and felt that patient had either MAT
or atrial tach with PAC and recommended holding on BBlocker.

Past Medical History:
- CAD s/p silent IMI; no prior interventions
- Hypercholesterolemia
- Hypertension
- CHF, systolic, EF 30% by echo (Echo [**2150-2-26**]: Overall left
ventricular systolic function is moderately-to-severely
depressed(ejection fraction 30 percent)secondary to severe
hypokinesis of the inferior septum and inferior free wall and
akinesis of the posterior (inferolateral) wall; the rest of the

left ventricle also appears at least mildly hypokinetic)
- COPD
- H/o actinic keratosis s/p cryotherapy [**2-/2150**]
- Seborrheic Keratosis
- H/o T1N0M0 NSCLC s/p L superior segmentectomy [**10/2147**]
- New lung nodule on CT of [**2149-12-30**]: surveillance CT in
[**2149-12-3**] identified a new right lower lobe nodule which was

found to be FDG PET avid. He underwent bronchoscopy at the end
of [**2150-1-2**]. The cytology from this examination was
unrevealing, however, the bronchoalveolar lavage grew an
atypical mycobacterium, Mycobacterium kansasii. This is felt to

be a colonizer. Subsequently, he had two induced sputum which
were negative with no growth. Subsequent CT scan in [**Month (only) 956**]
showed decreased size of this RLL lesion. At this point this
lung nodule is felt to be related to aspiration.

Micro:
[**2150-6-8**]: stool - c dif toxin +

Imaging:
[**2150-6-8**]:
CT abd/pelvis:
1. Continuous concentric mild bowel wall thickening from the
splenic flexure distally involving the entire sigmoid colon and
perhaps mildly also the rectum. No evidence of bowel
obstruction, pneumotosis, or portal venous gas. Considerations
would include inflammatory bowel disease such as colitis
ulcerosa or an infectious etiology. Given the distribution of
the bowel wall thickening, an ischemic origin seems less likely.
2. Since [**2147-9-3**], the left kidney demonstrates new atrophy
and decreased/delayed excretion, likely due to atherosclerotic
involvement of the left renal artery.
3. Cholelithiasis without evidence of cholecystitis.
4. Grossly distended stomach despite NG tube.
.
[**2150-6-8**]: CXR: No acute cardiopulmonary process. Tip of central
line now within right brachiocephalic vein.
.
CHEST, ONE VIEW: Comparison with multiple examinations, the most
recent of which is [**2150-6-25**], at 1333.

Endotracheal tube and right subclavian line are unchanged in
position. Cardiac, mediastinal, and hilar contours are
unchanged. Hazy opacity of the inferior portion of the left
hemithorax is again identified, which may reflect extensive left
lower lobe atelectasis/collapse, pleural fluid, or both. Of the
two, collapse is favored as the descending portion of the left
pulmonary artery appears silhouetted. The right lung is clear.
Both hemidiaphragms appear slightly flattened indicating
emphysema.

IMPRESSION: Hazy opacity over left hemithorax, concerning for
extensive left lower lobe atelectasis/collapse, layering left
pleural effusion, or both.

Brief Hospital Course:
In brief, the patient is a 68 y/o M with PMHx significant for
COPD, CHF, C. Diff colitis who presents to ED with fevers,
chills, diarrhea complicated by respiratory distress.
.
.
## Colitis/Diarrhea - The patient has a history of recurrent C.
diff colitis and presented with significant diarrhea and fever.
His stools studies were positive for actively shedding c. dif
toxin.  His abdominal imaging was consistent with a diffuse
infectious process.  He was initially treated with Iv flagyl and
oral vancomycin.  Routine stool cultures were sent.  The patient
was transiently hypotensive, but this was felt to be more likely
related to sedating medications peri-intubtation and PEEP than
from sepsis.  His blood pressure rapidly normalized initially.
However, near the end of his life we became increasingly
hypotensive, likely related to his persistent refractory atrial
fibrillation.
.
## Respiratory distress:  The patient's ED course was
complicated by respiratory distress.  There was no evidence of
pneumonia or other acute cardiopulmonary process.  He was
quickly extubated and was breathing well on room air.  The
likely source of his apparent distress was pain from the colitis
which in a patient with such significant COPD was cause for
concern.  His initial steroids directed at a COPD exacerbation
and antibiotics directed at a community acquired pneumonia were
discontinued.  His r
