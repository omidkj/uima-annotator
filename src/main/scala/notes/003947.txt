Pertinent Results:
[**2136-8-6**] Echo: PRE BYPASS The left atrium is markedly dilated.
The left atrium is elongated. No spontaneous echo contrast or
thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium/left atrial
appendage or the body of the right atrium/right atrial
appendage. The left atrial appendage emptying velocity is
depressed (<0.2m/s). No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or
color Doppler. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed
(LVEF= 40-45%). [Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is
likely more depressed given the severity of valvular
regurgitation.] The right ventricle displays normal free wall
contractility. There are simple atheroma in the ascending aorta.
There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch. The descending
thoracic aorta is mildly dilated. There are complex (>4mm)
atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. There are three
aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets are severely
thickened/deformed. There is critical aortic valve stenosis
(valve area = 0.6cm2). Mild to moderate ([**1-21**]+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are moderately
thickened. Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 914**] was notified in person of the results in the
operating room at the time of the study.
POST BYPASS The patient is being v-paced. There is normal
biventricular systolic function. The interventricular septum
shows dyssynchronous motion consistent with pacing. There is a
bioprosthesis located in the aortic position. It is well seated
and displays normal leaflet motion. No significant aortic
regurgitation is appreciated. The maximum gradient across the
aortic valve is 14 mmHg with a mean of 7 mmHg at a cardiac
output of 4.2 liters/minute. The effective orifice area of the
valve is 1.4 cm2. The mitral regurgitation is somewhat improved
- now moderate in severity. The tricuspid regurgitation is
somewhat improved - now mild. The thoracic aorta appears intact
after decannulation.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was a same day admit and on [**8-6**] was taken to the
Operating Room where he underwent aortic valve replacement and
ascending aortic endarterectomy. Please see operative report for
surgical details. Following surgery he was transferred to the
CVICU for invasive monitoring in unstable condition on Neo
Synephrine. he subsequently stabilized and was weaned from
sedation, awoke neurologically intact and extubated.

On [**8-8**] he underwent a right thoracentesis for 1200cc of straw
colored fluid.  He later that day was found to have a
significant hematocrit drop.  A chest tube was placed for about
2 liters of dark blood and he suffered a cardiac arrest.
Closed, then open massage were performed and he returned to the
Operating Room. He was returned to the ICU on Epinephrine, Neo
Synephrine and Nitroglycerin infusions with an open chest. He
stabilized, and on [**8-10**] returned to the operating Room for chest
washout and closure. He remained on multiple pressors.  He
became severely oliguric and CVVH was instituted with renal
consultation.  Fluid was removed gradualy and he weaned from
pressors.  Tube feeding was instituted and he gradually awoke.

He was transitioned to hemodialysis and as renal function
stabilized he was given a holiday from dialysis and remained
stable. He was extubated with some stridor which responded to
racemic Epinephrine. he improved, was able to swallow and tube
feeds were discontinued. He should have nectar-thick foods with
ground solids for dysphagia. He become progressively more alert
and was intact. Physical Therapy worked with him for
strengthening and he was screened for transfer to a
rehabilitation facility. He completed abx therapy today. Sternal
wound should be washed with hydrogen peroxide when showered. He
is to return to [**Hospital Ward Name 121**] 6 in 7 days for wound check and removal of
remaining sutures. Foley may be removed tomorrow [**8-30**]. Cleared
for discharge to [**Hospital1 **] at [**Hospital1 **] on [**8-29**]. Follow up appts
were advised.
