Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Atenolol / Diovan

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 800**]
Chief Complaint:
Fever, lethargy

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Right percutaneous nephrostomy tube
PICC line placement
Central line placement

History of Present Illness:
This is a 78 year old nursing home resident who presents to the
ED with fevers.  Per NH report, pt was in his usual state of
health until yesterday when he was noted to be lethargic and
febrile to 103.  He has also refused all of his medications for
the last 3 days.  Per his wife, he is minimally verbal at
baseline, but in the last few days he has been increasingly
lethargic and less interactive.  He was brought to the ED from
the NH given concerns for an infection.
.
EDVS: Temp:98 HR:62 BP:88/62 Resp:24 O(2)Sat:94 on RA.  He was
given 1.5 L IVF and SBP recovered to 110s.  He had a foley
cathether placement by urology requiring cystocope due to
uretheral stricture. Also of note, he had a CT abd/pelvis that
revealed a right hydronephrosis and perinephric stranding with
obstructive nephrolithiasis.  Urology recommended broad spectrum
antibiotics and IR consult for perc nephrostomy drainage.  He
was started on vancomycin and zosyn and he was sent to the MICU.

.
He arrived from the ED on a NRB.  He denies any acute complaints
and nods to yes/no questions.
.
Was transferred to the MICU and fluid resucitated. CT ABD/PElv
showed R hydro and perinephric stranding and 5mm UPJ stone felt
to be causing obstructive urosepsis. He underwent percutaneous
nephrostomy tube placement on the R without complications.
Notably, fever defervesced and WBC normalized. Patient's course
complicated by initial hypoxia and O2 requirement. He had a CXR
that showed patchy L sided retrocardiac density but this was not
felt to be PNA. Also, CEs checked on admission and found to be
elevated with new lateral ST depressions suggestive of [**First Name3 (LF) 7792**].
Given patient's multiple medical problems and comorbidities
[**Name (NI) 7792**] managed conservatively with continued ASA, Plavix and
statin. Heparin gtt not initiated given history of hemorrhagic
CVAs.
.
On arrival to the medical floor, patient has no complaints
including no abdominal pain, chest pain or shortness of breath.
He reports a good appetite and no nausea or vomiting.


Past Medical History:
-Hypertension.
-Seizure disorder.
-Multiple CVAs including cerebellar hemorrhage, has been in NH
for the last few years- First CVA was in [**2193**]. Hemorrhage was in

Microbiology:
BLOOD CULTURE  [**2204-6-15**] 11:15 pm:  ANAEROBIC GRAM POSITIVE
ROD(S). NOT RESEMBLING CLOSTRIDIUM SP. - sent out for
sensitivities and further speciation. Results may take up to 1
week.
BLOOD CULTURE ([**2204-6-19**]): No growth to date.
URINE CULTURE (Final [**2204-6-19**]):    NO GROWTH.
URINE CULTURE (Final [**2204-6-21**]): ESCHERICHIA COLI. ~3000/ML.
Sensitive to Cefepime and others.
.
Imaging:
[**2204-6-22**]: CT Head w/o Contrast: 1. No hemorrhage, edema, or
evidence of acute process. 2. Unchanged pattern of severe small
vessel ischemic change, focal encephalomalacia, and atrophy.
[**2204-6-22**]: CXR: There has been interval removal of the right PICC.
Mildly enlarged cardiac silhouette is unchanged. Tortuous aorta
is unchanged. Worsening left lower lobe consolidation and new
small left pleural effusion is noted. There is also a new
consolidation within the right lower lobe. No pneumothorax is
detected.
[**2204-6-19**]: CXR Right PICC with tip in the lower SVC without
complications.
[**2204-6-17**]: CT Head w/o Contrast: Stable appearance of multiple
chronic infarcts. If an acute infarct is suspected clinically,
MRI scanning with diffusion-weighted images is more sensitive
than the present non-contrast head CT scan.
[**2204-6-16**]: CT Abdomen: 1. Abdominal aortic aneurysm, measuring up
to 3.8 cm suprarenally and 3.5 cm infrarenally. Follow-up of
aortic and iliac aneurysms is suggested in one year by CT. 2.
Patient is status post aortobiiliac graft. Vascular patency is
not assessed without intravenous contrast. 3. No retroperitoneal
or periaortic hematoma to suggest active aneurysmal bleed. 4.
Mild-to-moderate right hydronephrosis, with associated stone in
the proximal right ureter/at the UPJ. Additional non-obstructing
stones identified in the right kidney. 5. Status post
cholecystectomy. 6. Sigmoid diverticulosis without evidence for
diverticulitis. 7. Bibasilar ground-glass opacities at the lung
bases, may represent atelectasis versus developing pneumonia.
Radiographic followup is suggested if the possibility of
pulmonary infection is a significant clinical concern.
[**2204-6-16**]: Echocardiogram:  EF 30-35%. Suboptimal image qualtity.
Regional left ventricular dysfunction consistent with
multivessel CAD. Mild mitral regurgitation. Borderline pulmonary
hypertension.


Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 78 yo with a history of HTN, CAD admitted with fever,
leukocytosis and hypotension found to have obstructing
nephrolithiasis in R ureter.
.
# Urosepsis: CT on admission showed obstructing nephrolithiasis
thought to be cause of urosepsis. Initial hypotension improved
with IVF resuscitation in the ICU. IR placed percutaneous
nephrostomy tube which drained franc pus.  Vanc/zosyn were
started for empiric coverage initially then switched to cefepime
for total 14 days vi
