Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1943**]
Chief Complaint:
Body aches

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
44 year-old woman with history of sickle cell disease and breast
cancer admitted with body aches, fever, and sinus congestion for
one day. Per patient she was in her usual state of health until
the day of admission when she developed subjective fever after
her shower. She then felt like she was coming down with a cold
with sinus congestion, slight headache, and body aches. Then she
developed pain all over her body more severe than anything she
has ever experienced before.

ED VS: T:101.8 HR:106  RR:16 O2Sat:100. she was given IVF and
tamiflu. She spiked a fever to 102.1 at 8pm.  Tachypneic in ED
so coming to unit. CTA negative for PE but did see infarcts in
lung and cannot tell if acute or chronic. No infiltrate. Tiny
right pleural effusion. PAH. Ibuprofen, tamiflu, morphine.

Labs with elevated WBC (13.4) and thrombocytosis, hct 19.8
(baseline for her). She got a flu swab. EKG normal. Because she
spiked a fever 102.1 and respiratory distress she was admitted
to the ICU.  The patient was subsequently more stable and
transferred to the floor.  She has no history of sickle cell
crisis.

Review of sytems:
(+) Per HPI
(-) Denies recent weight loss or gain.  Denied nausea, vomiting,
diarrhea, constipation or abdominal pain. No recent change in
bowel or bladder habits. No dysuria.

Past Medical History:
- Breast DCIS s/p surgery and radiation at [**Hospital1 2177**] with surgeon Dr.
[**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]. The patient refuses tamoxifen.
- Homzygous SS Sickle Cell Disease (followed by Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **]hematocrit range 19.5-23.1 and never been symptomatic per
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] note [**9-17**]
- Hyposplenism with "diminutive" spleen on CT Abd [**2159**]
- S/p appendectomy
- Biliary colic
- S/p tubal ligation
- Ovarian cyst - never had repeat u/s
- Shoulder injury

Social History:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] works at the [**Hospital1 18**] on CC7.  She is s/p tubal ligation
and currently sexually active with her husband.  She has no
history of STDs, no history of
abnormal Pap smears.  Her last Pap smear was approximately two
years ago.  She reports that her periods are currently regular
occurring one time a month.  She does not report heavy or
uncomfortable menses.  She has one daughter.

Family History:
The patient believes that both of her parents had sickle cell
trait.  She has 3 brothers, none of whom have sickle cell trait
or disease.  She also has 3 sisters, one of which does not have
sickle cell trait or disease, one of which
has sickle cell trait, and one of which had sickle cell disease
and has subsequently passed away.  The patient has no family
history of breast cancer. She also reports that her niece
recently died of sickle cell disease. Per OMR, the patient
reports that her father recently died of TB, although the
patient seems doubtful of this diagnosis.  She reports that she
has been PPD tested on a yearly basis, and her most recent PPD
was negative.  She had not been with her father who lived in
[**Country 2045**] while he was alive since her last PPD testing, so no
recent exposure to a patient with active TB that she knows of.

Physical Exam:

EKG: NSR with normal axis and intervals, wavy baseline but no
significant ST/TW changes

CXR [**2163-2-19**]: No acute cardiopulmonary process.

CTA [**2163-2-19**]: No PE, although motion limits assessment of distal
subsegmental vessels. Multiple small peripheral opacities
consistent with infarcts typical for sickle disease; acuity of
these unknown without prior exam. No pneumonia. Tiny right
pleural effusion. Enlarged pulmonary artery indicating pulmonary
arterial hypertension.

LE U/S [**2163-2-19**]:  No evidence for DVT in the bilateral lower
extremities.  Visualization of the distal superficial femoral
veins was limited.

ECHO [**2163-2-21**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial
septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular
wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic
function are normal (LVEF >55%). The right ventricular cavity is
mildly dilated with mild global free wall hypokinesis. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral
valve prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is moderate
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2162-9-29**],
the right ventricle is mildly dilated/hypokinetic with moderate
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. These findings are
consistent with hemodynamically significant pulmonary embolism.

Brief Hospital Course:
44 year-old woman history of SS sickle cell disease admitted
with flu-like illness and first sickle cell crisis that was
likely triggered from a respiratory infection and dehydration.

# Flu-like Illness: Symptoms consistent with acute flu-like
illness. Given her asplenism and risk for fulminant infection
she was started on abx while awaiting culture results including
vancomycin, ceftriaxone, azithromycin, and tamiflu. Nasal swab
returned negative on hospital day #1 and tamiflu was
discontinued. She was symptomatically treated with IVF, tylenol,
and oxygen supplementation. MRSA screen was negative, so Vanco
discontinued.  Pt treated empirically for PNA with
Ceftriaxone(changed to Cefpodoxime on discharge) and
Azithromycin for 7 days.

# Sickle Cell Crisis:  Hematology was consulted given question
of acute chest syndrome and potential need for exchange
transfusion or hydroxyurea. CT chest was reviewed with
hematology and consensus was that findings were chronic and not
consistent with acute chest syndrome. She received two units of
PRBCs in order to return to near baseline HCT. Crisis continued
to be treated with IVF, oxygen therapy and good pain control.
Patient is not up to date on appropriate immunizations and
received H1N1, seasonal influenza, and pneumovax prior to
discharge. She is due for menigicoccal and HiB as an outpatient.

The patient was pain free and with good oxygen saturation when
breathing room air both at rest and with ambulation on the day
of discharge.

# Pulmonary artery hypertension: CT Chest and Echocardiogram
both confirm PA hypertension.  PA hypertension is a common
complication seen in Sickle Cell Crisis from chronic hemolysis.
Pt will have follow up with Pulmonary as outpatient.  A repeat
Echocardiogram should be performed as an outpatient to evaluate
for interval change after sickle cell crisis has resolved.

# Echo report read as consistent with pulmonary embolism, but
the findings of RV failure and pulmonary hypertension is also
consistent with vaso occlusive crisis from sickle cell crisis.
CTA did not reveal central or segmental PEs.  The small filling
defect se
