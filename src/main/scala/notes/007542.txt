Chest/abd CT [**2-15**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. Acute pulmonary emboli, within segmental and subsegmental
branches of the right intralobar pulmonary artery.
2. Bilateral consolidative opacities.
3. Extensive intralobular septal thickening throughout both
lungs, which may be related to pulmonary venous hypertension or
fluid overload.
4. Mediastinal lymphadenopathy, and stranding within the
mediastinum.
5. Extensive inflammatory and/or edematous changes in the
mesentery and retroperitoneum, including pericholecystic fluid,
fluid and stranding around the duodenum, as well as fluid within
the mesentery and stranding. This appearance is atypical of a
Crohn's flare, and is non-specific, although peritonitis is a
possibility.
6. Marked thickening of the bowel wall in ileum, most severe in
a segment in the upper pelvis of about 10 cm in length, with no
evidence of obstruction. This degree is thickening is somewhat
more than expected in Crohn's and may be related to non-specific
wall edema.
7. Periportal edema.
8. Cystic lesion in the right adnexa, for which follow-up
evaluation by ultrasound would be recommended to ensure
resolution after six weeks. An adnexal cystic lesion is felt
much more likely than an abscess.
.

CXR [**2-15**]:New multifocal patchy opacities in the right and left
lungs concerning for infectious process. No free air under the
diaphragm.
.
Echo [**2128-2-15**]
Conclusions:
1.The left atrium is normal in size.
2. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. There is mild regional left
ventricular systolic dysfunction. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is mildly depressed.
3.Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal.
4.There is no pericardial effusion. There is an anterior space
which most likely represents a fat pad, though a loculated
anterior pericardial effusion cannot be excluded.
.

EKG:Sinus tachycardia
Borderline low QRS voltage - is nonspecific but clinical
correlation is
suggested
Since previous tracing of [**2127-11-13**], probably no significant
change
.
Abd ultrasound [**2-16**]:
FINDINGS: A limited abdominal ultrasound shows a trivial amount
of fluid within the right lower quadrant of the abdomen in a
quantity insufficient for safe paracentesis. A paracentesis was
not performed due to limited quantity of fluid. These findings
were discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 6812**] at the time of interpretation.
.
Echo [**2-16**]:
Conclusions:
1.The left atrium is mildly dilated.
2.Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity
size is normal. Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).

3.Right ventricular chamber size is normal. Right ventricular
systolic
function is normal.
4.The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with
good leaflet excursion.
5.The mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. Mild (1+)
mitral
regurgitation is seen.
6.The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal.
7. There is an anterior space which most likely represents a fat
pad, though a loculated anterior pericardial effusion cannot be
excluded. There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
.

CT head [**2-18**]:IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial hemorrhage or
findings to suggest acute major vascular territorial infarction.
.
CXR [**2-19**]:IMPRESSION: More widespread appearance of previously
seen multifocal patchy opacities, concerning for infectious
process.
.
CT abd/ches [**2-20**]: No definite evidence of prevailing pulmonary
emboli.
2. Resolution of bilateral consolidative opacities.
3. Increase in extent of patchy ground glass opacities mostly in
the upper lobes. This may represent changes due to fluid
overload. An infectious process cannot be excluded but seems
less likely.
4. Increase in bilateral pleural effusions.
5. Minimal improvement in
