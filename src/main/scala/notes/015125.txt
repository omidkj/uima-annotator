Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2009**]
Chief Complaint:
dyspnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
NIPPV

History of Present Illness:
86F w/ pmh of COPD on home O2 recent admission to [**Hospital1 **] for COPD flare transferred from [**Location (un) **] for respiratory
distress.  BIBEMS tonight with increasing prod cough and SOB,
accidentally dislodged O2 at home.  Per her daughter, she has
been more short of breath than usual even after being discharged
from the hospital approximately a week ago on antibiotics.  She
was seen by a pulmonologist who started spiriva and a steroid
taper (she took 40 mg yesterday).  She was dyspneic but
relatively comfortable last night prior to bed.  At 3am, her
daughter heard her calling from the bathroom where she was found
gasping for breath w/ O2 supply not connected (unclear how long
this had been the case).
.
On arrival to [**Location (un) **], hypoxic 60s% RA, tachycardic 120s-140s
with 4-12 beat run of NSVT. Sats improve to 92-95 on 5L. EKG
with NSTTW changes. CXR ? RML infiltrate.  Labs with WBC 24K,
CK/Trop 56/0.16. Rec'd Solumedrol 125mg IV, Levaquin 750mg IV,
Amiodarone 150mg IV. Transfer for elevated troponin, ?PE vs
hypoxia vs other. They did not CT patient at [**Location (un) **] b/c rad
tech is ~ 45min to 1 hr from hospital.  Pt was documented as
DNR/I. Also gave 5mg sc fondiparanux (VTE treatment - not
prophylaxis dose) empirically pending CT, and ASA.
.
In the ED, initial vs were: T 97.4 P 116 BP 151/82 R 18 O2 sat
97% on 6L. Patient was given Vanc, ceftriaxone, albuterol,
ipratropium nebs, NTG ggt.  EKG w/ ST depressions laterally.
V1-V2 ST elevations.  CP- l-sided.  Vitals prior to transfer.
116 (sinus), 182/96, 83% on BIPAP ([**8-16**]).  Access: 1 PIV, getting
another.
.
On arrival, she was in respiratory extremis w/ tachypnea,
pursed-lip breathing.  C/o intermittent chest pressure that was
L-sided.  Not pleuritic.  No f/c.  + productive cough (no
blood).  Recent decrease in appetite. + very thirsty.

Pertinent Results:
ECHO [**1-31**]:
The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. The
estimated right atrial pressure is 10-20mmHg. Left ventricular
wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There is abnormal
septal motion (?focal hypokinesis vs. IVCD). Overall left
ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50%). Right
ventricular chamber size is normal. with focal hypokinesis of
the apical free wall. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately
thickened. There is mild aortic valve stenosis (area
1.2-1.9cm2). No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Physiologic mitral regurgitation
is seen (within normal limits). There is moderate pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Normal right ventricular
cavity size with focal apical hypokinesis. Moderate pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. Abnormal interventricular septal
motion. Mild aortic valve stenosis. Low normal global left
ventricular systolic function.
.
[**2-2**] CXR:
There is emphysema. Cardiac size is normal. Right lower lobe
ill-defined opacity is increasing as does opacity in the right
upper lobe and engorgement of the vasculature. There is no
pneumothorax or large pleural effusions.
IMPRESSION: Interstitial pulmonary edema and emphysema.
.
[**1-30**] CXR:
No pneumonia or CHF. Irregular opacity in the left lung base may
represent a summation of overlying structures, although it would
be difficult to exclude nodule. Recommend repeat PA and lateral
radiograph with better inspiration and nipple markers.
.
EKG [**1-30**]: sinus tach, 120s, IVCD with left bundle pattern,
probable LVH, Q-waves V1-3 with mild repolarization increased ST
segments, no other acute ST-T changes
