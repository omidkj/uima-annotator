Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1666**]
Chief Complaint:
pancreatitis, hypercalcemia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
33yo previously healthy female presents from OSH with severe
hypercalcemia, acute pancreatitis who is now POD #0 s/p
C-section delivery of healthy male.  She reports that she has
had ongoing mid-low back pain x several months which became
worse over the past few days.  She also noted increasing
epigastric pain associated with nausea and vomiting at home over
the past 1-2 days.  She has not been tolerating PO.  She denies
diarrhea, however.  No fevers/chills.  No sick contacts.  She
reports that the pain became so severe ([**10-6**]) overnight that
she went to the local ED for further evaluation.
.
At the OSH ED, initial labs revealed significantly elevated WBC
count with neutrophils near 90% (no bands); she was afebrile.
Further noted was a serum calcium level of 18.5 and elevated
pancreatic enzymes as outlined below.  She is a former heavy
EtOH drinker, but has been sober x8 years.  She denies RUQ pain
currently nor colicky pain in the past and is w/o h/o
gallstones.  She reports severe "heartburn" during her pregnancy
for which she's been taking 15+ tums daily (finishes an entire
bottle approximately every 1-2wks).  She has also been taking
daily prenatal vitamin daily, but denies any additional
prescription nor OTC medications.
.
In the ED at OSH, she was evaluated by Ob/gyn who found
nonreassuring fetal heart tones on monitoring.  She was taken to
the OR for emergent/urgent c-section at 35 weeks.  Per records,
it appears that she was placed on cefoxitin perioperatively, but
no additional abx.  She received NS and then LR at continuous
rate of 150cc/hour for unclear total amount.  Per record it
appears she was placed on tums prn despite her critically
elevated calcium and received a one time dose this morning.  A
CT scan was reportedly performed post c-section, but in
discussion with medical records at OSH, there is no report of
this.
.

.
[**7-29**] head CT: No acute intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect.
[**7-29**] CT abd/ pelvis: 1.  Peripancreatic edema and mild
enlargement of the pancreas, consistent with pancreatitis.
Complications of pancreatitis unable to be evaluated on
noncontrast scan.  Extensive free fluid and mesenteric edema,
likely due to both pancreatitis as well as
postoperative/postpartum condition. 2. Enlarged, postpartum
uterus.

.
[**2173-8-3**] CT abd/ pelvis: 1.  Findings compatible with
non-complicated pancreatitis, not significantly changed from
prior, however the administration of contrast allows
visualization of a homogeneous, non-necrotic pancreatic
parenchyma and no significant pseudocyst formation or other
related complication. 2.  Bilateral pleural effusions, right
greater than left. 3.  Post-partum uterus with internal fluid
and debris, in keeping with recent C-section.

Brief Hospital Course:
33yoF presented to OSH with severe abdominal and back pain,
found to have acute pancreatitis and severe hypercalemia,
presenting POD 0 s/p cesarean section for nonreassuring fetal
heart tones, and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] ICU for further
management. Course complicated by agitation and worsening
respiratory distress.

1. Pancreatitis:  Given her significantly elevated calcium on
admission with report of significant Tums intake, this was felt
to be the likely cause of her pancreatitis.  Her triglycerides
were elevated but not markedly so (488 at OSH, 273 here) and
seems less likely cause of her pancreatitis.  By [**Last Name (un) 5063**]
criteria on initial presentation had WBC count of >16K, glucose
of 205 which correlates with <5% motality.  CT abd/pelvis was
obtained which showed evidence of pancreatitis - fat stranding
and free fluid in abd. also small amount of intra-abd free air
c/w post-op, and lung base atelectasis and effusions.  She was
placed npo, given aggressive IVF and placed on TPN with serial
following of abdominal exams and lipase.
-she clinically improved, was ultimately transferred to the
regular medical floor, with resolution of abdominal pain, and
tolerating a regular diet.
.
2. Respiratory distress: Patient failed pressure support trial
on [**7-30**], with agitation and frequent desats to the 80s. Pt was
then on AC requiring increased oxygen requirements (up to FIO2
0.7). CXR on [**7-30**] suggested increased pulmonary edema v. ARDS.
Fluids were held/minimized and diuresis was attempted with 20mg
IV lasix x2, with no improvement in O2 saturation. It was felt
the patient could meet the requirements for ARDS, with
hypoxemia, bilateral infiltrates, Pa)2/FIO2 <200 and clinically
not suspected to have CHF. She was successfully extubated and
diuresed with IV lasix.  She was transferred to the floor and
gradually weaned off of supplemental oxygen.
-on the medical floor, she was ambulating freely without SOB, 02
sats remained 97% on RA with ambulation.
-she did have some residual hoarsness most likely due to
intubation which should continue to improve.
.
3. Agitation: on [**7-29**] the patient became increasingly tachypneic,
tachycardic, and hypertensive with evidence of desaturation
secondary to agitation. Pt was intubated for control of airway,
and exhibited agitation in waxing/ [**Doctor Last Name 688**] pattern on both
propofol and versed/fentanyl for sedation. Etiologies included
calcium or electrolyte abnormalities, drug withdrawal, pain.
Intra-cranial process ruled out by neg. head CT. serum and urine
tox neg (except opioids - administered here). Patient was
started on haldol IV standing and placed on a 1 to 1 sitter.
She was then transitioned to PRN haldol with an appropriate
response.
-she was transferred to a medical floor, not requiring any prn
medicines for agitation, she was seen by ps
