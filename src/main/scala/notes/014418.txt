CHIEF COMPLAINT:  GI bleed, acute MI.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 70-year-old man
with coronary artery disease, status post CABG, end stage
renal disease on hemodialysis and CHF with an EF of
approximately 35% at baseline.  He was admitted to [**Hospital **]
Hospital on [**2103-7-31**] after an episode of chest pain and
shortness of breath at hemodialysis.  He reportedly had a
similar episode on [**2103-7-28**] at hemodialysis.  ECG at that time
showed a left bundle branch pattern.  Troponins of 0.17 and
2.01 were obtained.  He was started on Heparin for presumed
acute coronary syndrome.  At 6:30 the following morning on
[**2103-8-1**] he became diaphoretic and briefly lost consciousness.
A code was called at that time and the patient was
resuscitated.  He had melena and coffee ground emesis with a
hematocrit dropping from 33.5 to 26.9.  He became bradycardic
to the 40's, was given Atropine and was intubated.  CK rose
to 727 and troponin I of 34 at that time.  An EGD was
performed and no ulcer was visualized secondary to not being
able to enter the duodenum.  Repeat echo showed an EF of 25%
with 3-4+ MR.  [**Name13 (STitle) **] was given 6 units of packed red cells, 4
units FFP, started on Levophed for hemodynamic support and
transferred to the [**Hospital1 69**] for
further management.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Coronary artery disease status post
CABG, end stage renal disease secondary to glomerulonephritis
on hemodialysis, ischemic cardiomyopathy, COPD, history of
supraventricular tachycardia, laryngeal carcinoma status post
XRT to larynx, benign prostatic hypertrophy, ventral hernia.

MEDICATIONS:  Outpatient medications are as follows:  Digoxin
0.125 mg po q d, Iron Sulfate 325 mg po q d, Nephrocaps,
Aspirin 81 mg po q d, Phos-Lo 2-3 tabs with meals, Paxil 10
mg po q d, Rocaltrol 0.25 mg po q d, Prevacid 15 mg po q d,
Zestril 5 mg po q d, Cardura 2 mg po q d, Flovent and AeroBid
inhalers, Klonopin 0.5 mg [**Hospital1 **] prn.  Medications on transfer
to [**Hospital1 69**]:  Albuterol, Flovent,
Prevacid, Cardura, Klonopin, Lisinopril, Paxil, Rocaltrol,
Digoxin, Ferrous Gluconate, Aspirin, Phos-Lo and
Nitroglycerin.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is a retired teacher.  He is
married and lives with his wife, they are raising their
granddaughter.  [**Name (NI) **] ethanol use.  He quit smoking
approximately 7 years ago.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient was intubated at time of
transfer with a Propofol drip.  Blood pressure was 84/37,
heart rate in the 80's.  Oxygen saturation was 92-94% on 50%
FIO2.  His HEENT exam was unremarkable.  Mucus membranes were
moist.  Pupils were equal, round and reactive to light.  OGT
and EDT were both present.  JVD could not be actually
assessed.  The lungs had coarse breath sounds throughout.
Heart was regular rate and rhythm, 2/6 systolic murmur was
noted at the apex.  His abdomen was soft, nontender, non
distended.  Extremities were without edema.

LABORATORY DATA:  On admission, WBC 19.4, hematocrit 37.7,
platelet count 207,000, sodium 141, potassium 6.3, chloride
105, CO2 18, BUN 79, creatinine 6.7, INR 1.5, PTT 50.3, EKG
showed sinus rhythm at a rate of 69, left bundle branch block
with 2-[**Street Address(2) 2051**] depressions in V5 and V6.  Chest x-ray showed
right pleural effusion with right lower lobe infiltrate.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the CCU for
further management after cardiac catheterization.

1.  Cardiac:  Cardiac catheterization showed two patent
grafts but could not identify blood flow to the left
circumflex territory.  No interventions were done at this
time.  The patient was quickly weaned off pressors on [**8-8**].
During hemodialysis the patient went into atrial fibrillation
with rapid ventricular rate.  He was rate controlled with
Diltiazem as the family requested the avoidance of beta
blockers.  He was subsequently loaded on Amiodarone and
spontaneously converted to normal sinus rhythm.  On [**2103-8-9**]
the patient had a 10 beat and then a subsequent 5 beat run of
ventricular tachycardia.  He was seen by EP at that time,
however, due to a national state of emergency, further EP
evaluation could not be performed as an inpatient.  Instead,
he will have a complete EP study with possible placement of
an ICD as an outpatient.  In the interim, the patient has
been given an event recorder.

2.  Pulmonary:  The patient was noted to have an aspiration
pneumonia on chest x-ray and elevated white count at time of
admission.  He was treated with a 14 day course of
Levofloxacin and Flagyl.  He was extubated on the third and
was subsequently noted to have some wheezes.  He was
initially treated with Albuterol nebs and then switched over
to Combivent MDI and restarted on his at home medications.

3.  GI:  The patient's hematocrit was stable throughout this
hospitalization.  He was started on a proton pump inhibitor.
Initially he had some heme positive discharge from his NG
tube.  On [**8-13**] he had two episodes of emesis that were heme
positive.  Since then his hematocrit has continued to be
stable.  However, it was decided to defer further evaluation
of this until the patient was an outpatient as proper
evaluation cannot occur during the peri MI period because
this places him at greatly increased risk.  His H. pylori
status was noted to be negative.  He will follow-up with GI
as an outpatient.

4.  Renal:  At the time of admission the patient was given
Calcium Gluconate and Kayexalate for hyperkalemia.  He was
then hemodialyzed on his regular schedule without further
incident.

5.  Neuro:  The patient initially had decreased levels of
consciousness after extubation, only being oriented to
person.  With continued PT and recuperation, the patient
became alert and oriented times three.

6.  Fluids, Electrolytes & Nutrition:  The patient was noted
to have difficulty swallowing shortly after extubation.  A
video swallow study showed deep laryngeal penetration of
thick and thin liquids.  He subsequently tolerated a moist
solid with liquids thickened to nectar consistently diet.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  ASA 81 mg po q d, Paxil 10 mg po q d,
Cardura 1 mg po q h.s., Protonix 40 mg po q d, Captopril 50
mg po tid, Flovent 2 puffs [**Hospital1 **], Serevent 2 puffs [**Hospital1 **],
Combivent MDI 2 puffs qid prn, Digoxin 0.125 mg po q d,
Amiodarone 400 mg po q d, Iron Sulfate 325 mg po q d, Phos-Lo
three tablets po tid with meals, Nephrocaps, Klonopin 0.5 mg
po bid prn, Trazodone 25 mg po q h.s. prn.

The patient was discharged to [**Hospital 1319**] Rehab in stable
condition.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
1.  GI bleed.
