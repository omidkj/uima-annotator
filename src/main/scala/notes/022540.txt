Chief Complaint:
respiratory failure


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
1. right IJ placed
2. intubated
3. arterial line placement

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 2450**] is a 64yo woman with a DM2, CAD, history of morbid
obesity, obstructive sleep apnea on CPAP, diastolic heart
failure, COPD, obesity hyperventilation syndrome, and smoking,
who presents with 2 days of generalized malaise and weakness,
and acute onset respiratory distress.  Per EMS prior to arrival,
pt had no localizing symptoms of fever, chills, nausea,
vomiting, SOB or cough. On arrival, pt was afebrile, and in
respiratory distress, breathing at rate of 20-39 with SBP 100/80
initially. BiPAP was tried for 5mins, but she was unable to
protect her airway and was intubated. No prior history was able
to be obtained given intubation.
.
In the ED, initial VS were 99.2 108 BP low 100s per report RR 20
96%. Her exam was notable for respiratory distress, lungs poor
air movement, diffuse wheezing. Pt intubated for inability to
protect airway, with confirmed ETT and OGT placement. EKG showed
non-specific T wave changes, sinus tach, few PAC's. [**Known lastname **]
post-intubation showed 7.17/69/245/26, COHb 14. Per toxicology
fellow, does not meet criteria for carbon monoxide poisoning.
CXR showed no clear infiltrate, but could not be ruled-out. Labs
notable for Lactate 1.9, BNP 22,991. Tox screen sent and
negative. Pt was given Midazolam & Fentanyl for sedation. Also
given Azithromcyin 500mg IV x1, Methylprednisolone 125mg IV x1,
Atrovent neb. Given unable to exclude PNA and hypotensive, given
Vanc/Zosyn. Also initially gave 500cc fluid bolus for
hypotension. Attempted a-line placement, but unable to obtain.
Were able to place R IJ (not yet confirmed), and 2 PIV's. Pt was
placed on levophed 0.12 for low BP, with recent MAPs in mid 60s.

.
On the floor, pt is currently intubated and sedated. Levophed
was off on transfer, and restarted given SBP to 80s on
admission.
.
Review of systems:  unable to obtain given intubated, sedated
