44, 156, 26, sodium 138, potassium 4.7, chloride 102, bicarb
23, BUN 13, creatinine 1.0, glucose 168.  His CKs were 963
with an MB fraction of 44, index of 5, trended down to 709,
then 494, to 391, to 193.  EKG on admission - the patient had
a normal sinus rhythm at 78 beats per minute.  Axis showed
left anterior descending, interval 164, 83, 55.  He had Q
waves in V1 through V4 and II, III and S.  ST elevations 1 mm
in II and S, 4 mm in V2, V3 and F4, and 3 mm in V5, 2 mm in
V6.

HISTORY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient went for a cardiac
catheterization on the day of admission which showed an
ejection fraction of 35%, apical and anterolateral
hypokinesis.  It showed RA mean pressure of 14, RV pressure
33/13, PA pressure 33/18 with a mean of 26, wedge 18, left
ventricular pressure 103/20, cardiac output 3.6, cardiac
index 1.8, SVR 1579 and peripheral vascular resistance 178.
His PA sat was 63%.  His catheterization also showed
one-vessel disease, left main, no stenosis.  He had a distal
left anterior descending ulcerated 90% stenotic lesion past
the origin of diagonal-2 and occluded with thrombus at the
origin of D-3.  He also had moderate systolic and diastolic
ventricular dysfunction.

1) CARDIOVASCULAR COURSE - MYOCARDIUM:  The patient is status
post an anterior wall MI, now with an ejection fraction of
35% and anterior and apical hypokinesis.  The patient was
decided to be placed on coumadin for six months for his
apical and anterolateral hypokinesis, as well as his anterior
MI.  The patient was begun on coumadin.  His PT and INR was
not therapeutic at time of discharge.  However, the patient
was started on Lovenox 60 mg subcu [**Hospital1 **] which the patient was
instructed how to give himself which he was able to do quite
well.  The patient was also begun on an ACE inhibitor and
beta blocker, initially on captopril and Lopressor,
eventually switched to Mavik 1 mg po qd and atenolol 25 mg po
qd at time of discharge.

CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE:  The patient is status post stent to
the LAD and acute anterior MI.  He was started on aspirin 325
mg qd, Plavix 75 mg qd for 30 days.  The patient's lipid
levels were checked and were found to be total cholesterol
122, triglycerides 112, HDL 27, LDL 73.  However, after much
discussion with the team it was decided that his lipid levels
may be falsely decreased in a setting of an acute myocardial
infarction.  The patient was begun on Lipitor 10 mg po q hs
which his primary care physician and cardiologist can choose
to continue or not as they see fit.

CONDUCTION:  The patient remained in normal sinus rhythm
throughout the hospital course with no events.

2) PULMONARY:  The patient continued to sat well on room air
and no issues.  He has decided to quit smoking cigarettes.
He says that at this time he would like to try doing without

4) HEME:  The patient was on Integrelin after the procedure
and he was placed on a heparin drip while coumadin was
started and later changed over to Lovenox.  He is to be
discharged on Lovenox, as well as coumadin 3 mg po q hs.  He
will check his INR and PT on Monday and fax results to his
primary care physician, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) 20426**].

DISPOSITION:  The patient is to be discharged to home to
follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 20426**] on Wednesday, [**10-16**].  He will
also follow-up with cardiology, Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 7047**].

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  The patient was discharged in stable
condition to home.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  Include 1) Mavik 1 mg po qd, 2)
atenolol 25 mg po qd, 3) aspirin 325 mg po qd, 4) Plavix 75
mg po qd x 30 days, 5) Lovenox 60 mg subcu q 12 h until
therapeutic INR, 6) coumadin 3 mg q hs, 7) Lipitor 10 mg po q
hs and the patient has a prescription to check his INR and PT
on Monday.  He will also have VNA services come to his home
to assist him with his new medications and adjustment to his
decreased ventricular function and new myocardial infarction.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:  1) Coronary artery disease.  2) Acute
anterior myocardial infarction.
