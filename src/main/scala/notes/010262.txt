ECG

[**9-9**] Sinus tachycardia. Poor R wave progression which is
non-diagnostic.
Lateral and inferolateral ST wave abnormalities which are
non-specific.
Compared to tracing of [**2102-9-1**] there is no significant
diagnostic change.

[**9-11**] Sinus rhythm. Peaked P waves with rightward P wave axis.
Non-specific lateral ST segment changes. Compared to the prior
tracing of [**2102-9-11**] the rate has increased. Otherwise, no
diagnostic interim change.

Chest X-ray
- [**9-9**] Pleuroparenchymal scarring in the upper lobes bilaterally,
unchanged compared to the prior study. No definite cavitary
lesion is seen.
- [**9-11**] No new cardiopulmonary abnormality. Hyperinflation due to
emphysema or small airways obstruction is longstanding. The
contents of the left apical cavity have decreased which may
represent expectoration of previous mycetoma. Smaller right
apical lesion and adjacent pleural thickening are longstanding.
No pulmonary edema, pneumonia or indication of pulmonary
hemorrhage. Heart size normal. No pleural effusion

Foot films [**9-10**]
A healing fracture is present at the base of the second
metatarsal. Additionally, sclerosis is present at the base of
the fourth metatarsal, consistent with a healing fracture at
this site. In retrospect, a transverse lucency is seen through
this area on the original study of [**2102-8-21**].
Additionally, there is a more subtle area of sclerosis at the
base of the third metatarsal, also likely related to a healing
fracture.


Brief Hospital Course:
In the ED his vitals were T 98.1, HR 106, BP 169/104, O2 sat 96%
RA. He was given ASA and placed on a CIWA scale. His tox screen
was positive for alcohol with a level of 435. Also positive for
cocaine and benzos. He denied using these since the previous
week. His cardiac enzymes were negative x 1.
.
He was admitted to SIRS1 in the morning of [**9-11**]. He reported
hardly any CP or SOB, endorsed left foot pain and anxiety, and
requested valium. ROS was otherwise negative.
.
On the medicine floor his cardiac enzymes were negative x 2,
completing his rule-out. He was evaluated by psychiatry and
placed on a CIWA scale. His anxiety was managed with seroquel.
He was given thiamine, folate, and MVI for his alcoholism. He
recieved a total of 560mg IV/PO valium over the course of the
day and was found to be hypotensive to 70/30 at 2200. He also
had SBPs in the 170s and 180s earlier in the day. He had no
signs of distress, lethargy, or obtundation - he was mentating
well and protecting his airway. He was given a 500cc bolus x1 w/
correction of BP to 90/60. He was then given a second bolus
before transfer to the MICU for observation.
.
In the MICU, he was observed and given gentle IV fluid
hydration. His blood pressure medications were held and he was
continued on a less agressive CIWA scale (10mg q2hrs) held for
hypotension or sedation. He was found to have negative cardiac
enzymes, which were not repeated. His LFTs and CXR were
unremarka
