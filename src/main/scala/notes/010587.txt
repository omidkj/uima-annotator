RADIOLOGY  Final Report

MR HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2149-10-27**] 1:55 PM

MR HEAD W/O CONTRAST; MRA BRAIN W/O CONTRAST

Reason: asses for recent stroke

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
83 year old woman s/p CABG c/b cva
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
asses for recent strokeplease use DWI
CLINICAL INFORMATION: Status post CABG, question recent stroke.

NONCONTRAST MR OF THE HEAD:
Diffusion-weighted images cannot be obtained due to technical
difficulties with the MR device.

FINDINGS: There is an area of increased signal on T2 and FLAIR
signal in the left side of the pons consistent with infarction.
In retrospect it is possible that there was an abnormality here
at the time of the CT scan of [**2149-10-24**], but this is
indefinite. This would be consistent with an infarct which is
either remote or subacute. There is low signal in this region on
the axial T1-weighted sequence. There are multiple T2-weighted
high-intensity signal foci in the periventricular white matter
and centrum semiovale consistent with microvascular angiopathy.
There is no evidence of mass effect or hemorrhage. There is no
displacement of normally midline structures. There is no
evidence of a focal extra-axial lesion or fluid collection.
Ventricles and sulci are mild prominent consistent with mild
brain atrophy and cavum septum pellucidum et Vergae is noted.

There also are some abnormalities in the left cerebellar
hemisphrere consistent with a subacute or remote infarction.

IMPRESSION: Abnormality within the pons and perhaps cerebellar
hemsipheres consistent with infarction. The age of this is
indeterminate at this point.

MRA OF THE CIRCLE OF [**Location (un) **] AND ITS MAJOR TRIBUTARIES

FINDINGS: There is no definite evidence of abnormal flow or
aneurysm within the carotid circuit. The left vertebral artery
becomes very small after the left PICA and the right vertebral
artery appears to end in the PICA. The basilar artery is
diminutive and irregular. There does appear to be flow to the
posterior cerebral arteries via patent posterior communicating
fetal-type arteries which may make the basilar artery rather
developmentally small but I suspect that there is addition some
atherosclerotic disease of the basilar artery.

IMPRESSION: Suspect diffuse atherosclerotic narrowing of basilar
artery. See above discussion.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the CSRu and on [**2149-10-22**] she
underwent CABGx2 w/ LIMA->LAD and SVG->OM.  Her cross clamp time
was 28 minutes and total bypass time was 48 mins.  She was
transferred to the CSRU on Amiodorone, Neo, Epi, Milrinone, and
Propofol.  She remained intubated and was in afib.  She
continued on Epi, Levo, and Natracor and had a slight metabolic
acidosis.  Her IABP was removed on POD# 1 and she remained
intubated.  On POD#2 she developed new right-sided weakness and
she was seen by neurology.  She had a left periventricular
hypodensity on CT and MRI later on revealed multiple shower
emboli in the pons and cerebellar hemispheres.
She was extubated on POD#4 and remained on Levo, Natracor, and
Milrinone.  She continued to be aggresively diuresed and
progressed.  There was a major discrepancy in her blood
pressures because of PVD.  Her central systolic pressure was 60
points higher than the blood pressure in her left are, and her
right arm pressure was even lower. Eventually all of her drips
were discontinued and she was transferred to the floor on POD#
8.  She continued to progress and was discharged to rehab in
stable condition on POD#9.
