HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a [**Age over 90 **]-year-old female
with a history of coronary artery disease, status post a
stent to the right coronary artery three years ago, several
bilateral lower extremity peripheral vessel disease,
hypothyroidism, polycythemia [**Doctor First Name **], chronic atrial
fibrillation and chronic urinary tract infections who was
admitted on [**2146-11-7**] to [**Hospital6 5016**] with acute
respiratory distress, fever and hypotension after an episode
of substernal chest pressure, nausea and vomiting.  The
patient was brought to the Emergency Room where she acutely
decompensated.  At the outside hospital, over one month
course the patient was started on Dopamine from [**11-7**] to [**11-10**]
was acutely febrile, had a white blood count of 34 and was
intubated shortly after admission.  The patient had been on
Ciprofloxacin as an outpatient for chronic urinary tract
infection.  It was felt at that time that the patient had
sepsis due to urinary tract infection verses pneumonia.  She
was also anuric on presentation.  The patient was started on
Vancomycin, Tequin and Ceftazidime.  She had improvement with
decrease in her white blood count to 14 however, she
continued to have fevers of 101 to 102 during the hospital
course without ever isolating the source.

The patient's antibiotic regimen was changed to Zosyn,
Gatafloxacin and Diflucan for [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] urinary tract
infection.  She was also started on Solu Medrol on [**11-15**] for
four days for unclear reasons. She became less ventilatory
dependent and tolerated pressure support of 5 with a PEEP of
0.  She was actively diuresed with daily Lasix.  On [**11-22**] all
the antibiotics were discontinued.

On [**11-24**] the patient was extubated however, several hours
later was re-intubated for tachycardia and tachypnea.  Was
restarted on Dopamine and Dobutamine on [**11-24**] through [**11-27**].
She was unable to diurese secondary to hypotension.  An
echocardiogram one on [**11-28**] showed an EF of 55 to 65%,
moderate AI and MR.  Bilateral atrial enlargement. For
sedation the patient received Ativan and Morphine on a p.r.n.
basis.

Upon family request the patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 1444**] for further management.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Chronic urinary tract infection,
hypothyroidism, coronary artery disease, status post stent to
rhe right coronary artery three years ago, status post left
clavicular fracture, hypotension, polycythemia [**Doctor First Name **], history
of a Transient ischemic attack, question of a B12 deficiency,
bilateral lower extremity, peripheral vascular disease,
question of renal artery stenosis by catheterization in
[**2144-12-8**], hemorrhoids, status post hysterectomy.

ALLERGIES:  Question of an anaphylactic reaction to Marcaine,
intolerance to narcotics.  Allergies to Procainamide (?).

MEDICATIONS:
1.  Insulin drip
2.  Heparin drip.
3.  Synthroid 100 mg q day.
4.  Hydroxyurea 500 mg q day.
5.  Flagyl 500 mg three times a day.
6.  Aspirin 81.
7.  Morphine p.r.n.
8.  Ativan p.r.n.
9.  Prevacid 30 mg
10. Tylenol p.r.n.
11. Hydrochloride 100 mg three times a day.

ASSESSMENT:  This is a [**Age over 90 **]-year-old female with urosepsis
verses pneumonia sepsis.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  Hypotension - initially responded well to intravenous
fluids but remained hypotensive despite CVP's in the 20's.
Swann on [**12-2**] was labile numbers.  Have tried multiple
pressors.  Needs Levophed to keep SCL up, lytes, Dopamine to
keep the heart rate up.  Dropped cardiac output with
Dobutamine.

The next pressor to try would have been Vasopressin.  Also
initially had a court Stim test to which she responded.  We
also treated hypothyroidism without improved hemodynamics.

By [**2145-12-6**] she was still requiring Levo and Dopamine to
maintain pressures.

2.  Atrial fibrillation/Sick Sinus - when admitted had atrial
fibrillation in the 60's, occasionally up to 100.  Over the
last few days of admission had been bradycardiac down to the
junctional scape rhythms.  Holding Digoxin and had pacer pads
placed in case she bradycardia down again.  If she did clear
the sepsis the plan was that she may need a pacer.  However,
by [**12-6**] she had no bradycardiac episodes in the last 48
hours and was off the Heparin because she had a bleed at the
right IJ Swann site a few days ago requiring one unit of
packed red blood cells for a four point hematocrit drop.


3.  Polycythemia [**Doctor First Name **] - with leukocytosis and thrombocytosis.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] from Hematology was following.  There was no evidence
of a leukemic transformation just a leukemoid reaction.  She
was started on Hydroxyurea to treat the platelets and white
blood cell count.

4.  Pulmonary Status:  The patient was vent dependent with
bilateral effusions and pulmonary edema secondary to
diastolic dysfunction, total body overloaded and
hypoalbuminemia.  She was trached on [**2145-12-3**] which went
well.  She did have a bronchoscopy done which was normal and
no tissue or lavage was done at the time.

5.  Oliguria - the patient was currently oliguric most likely
to poor hemodynamics.  This did not improve even with a Lasix
drip, Dobutamine or dopamine initially.  However, by [**12-6**]
she had some improved urine output when greater than 70's on
Levophed and Dopamine.

6.  Infectious Disease.  The patient was C. diff negative but
had pseudomonas in the urine and was changed to Cefepime on
[**2145-12-3**] as it was not sensitive to the Ceftazidime that she
was initially placed on.  Sputum was growing coag positive
staphaureus that was Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus
aureus positive so she was started on Vancomycin.  The exam
was consistent with sepsis and without the Levophed her SVR
dropped to the 500.

7.  Fluids, Electrolytes, Nutrition:  The patient was
continued on tube feeds and electrolytes were repleted as
needed.

8.  Endocrine.  TSH was 20 on admission, did not get
Synthroid for one month at the outside hospital.  Was loaded
with intravenous Levoxyl and the T4-T3 came back to normal
range on [**12-4**] therefore she was switched to p.o.
Levothyroxine.  Stress dose steroids were weaned completely
by [**2145-12-7**].

9.  Neurological.  The patient responds to pain, is hard of
hearing which may be contributing to the non-responsiveness
of voice.  We attempted to minimize Ativan and Morphine
throughout the admission.  A Head CT at the outside
reportedly is negative for bleed or stroke.

10.  Communication.  Extensive conversations with the family
and with the attending about lack of improvement on
antibiotics.  Several family meetings were held and the
family had initially wanted to continue on aggressively for
several days.  Finally as recovery seemed futile and the
patient had not responded to many days on antibiotics the
decision was finally made to change her care to comfort
measures.
This was done and the patient passed away peacefully on
[**2145-12-8**] on a Morphine drip for pain.
