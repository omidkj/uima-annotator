History of Present Illness:
THis 71F w/HTN, COPD, AS and chronic diastolic heart failure was
admitted to [**Hospital3 **] w/CHF exacerbation and RLE
cellulitis on [**2200-3-28**] and was  transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] cardiology

Pertinent Results:

3. Mildly elevated right-sided filling pressures.
4. Moderate pulmonary arterial hypertension

.
XR ankle
Three views of the right ankle were reviewed.
There is no evidence of fracture, dislocation, lytic or
sclerotic lesions
demonstrated. Minimal soft tissue swelling around lateral
malleolus is noted with otherwise no appreciable abnormality
seen. If clinically warranted, correlation with cross-sectional
imaging might be considered.
.
CAROTID U/S SHOWED
Right antegrade vertebral artery flow.
Left antegrade vertebral artery flow.

Impression: Right ICA <40% stenosis.
Left ICA <40% stenosis
.
[**2200-4-11**] Intra-op TEE
Conclusions
PRE-CPB: 1. The left atrium is moderately dilated. No thrombus
is seen in the left atrial appendage. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler.
2. There is severe symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The
left ventricular cavity size is normal. Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
3. There are simple atheroma in the ascending aorta. There are
complex (>4mm) atheroma in the aortic arch. There are complex
(>4mm) atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
4. There are three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve
leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. There is critical
aortic valve stenosis (valve area <0.8cm2). Moderate (2+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The annulus measures 19 mm.
5. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial
mitral regurgitation.
6. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in person of the results.

POST-CPB: On infusion of nitroprusside. AV pacing transiently.
Well-seated bioprosthetic valve in the aortic position with no
AI seen. Gradient measures peak of 26 at a cardiac output of 5.1
L/min. MR [**Name13 (STitle) **] trace, TR is 2+. The aortic contour is normal
post decannulation.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)   Clip # [**Clip Number (Radiology) 110264**]
Reason: eval for effusion

Final Report
INDICATION: Recent aortic valve replacement. Evaluation for
effusion.

TECHNIQUE: Portable AP chest radiograph.

COMPARISON: [**4-11**] through [**2200-4-13**].

FINDINGS: Low lung volumes are noted along with obscuration of
the left
costophrenic angle, likely representing a pleural effusion.
There is mild
pulmonary vascular congestion. The right IJ catheter terminates
in the right
atrium. There is no focal consolidation or pneumothorax. Median
sternotomy
wires and aortic valve replacement are noted. There is no change
in the
cardiomediastinal silhouette.

IMPRESSION: Left pleural effusion and mild pulmonary vascular
congestion.

The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

Brief Hospital Course:
This 71F w/HTN, COPD, AS and chronic diastolic heart failure
admitted to [**Hospital3 **] w/CHF exacerbation and RLE
cellulitis on [**2200-3-28**], transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for AS eval/mgmt.
She continued to be gently diuresed and had a cardiac cath which
revealed no coronary artery disease.  Her cellulitis in the RLE
was treated initially with Keflex with an inadequate response.
She was changed to Vancomycin and the cellulitis improved.
Cardiac surgery was consulted and on [**2200-4-11**] she underwent
aortic valve replacement.
She tolerated the procedure well and post-operatively was
transferred to the CVICU in stable condition for recovery and
invasive monitoring.  POD 1 found the patient extubated, alert
and oriented and breathing comfortably.  Blood pressure was
initially labile, requiring high volume resuscitation.  The
patient was neurologically intact and hemodynamically stable,
weaned from inotropic and vasopressor support.  Parkinson's meds
were resumed.  Beta blocker was initiated and the patient was
gently diuresed toward the preoperative weight.  The patient was
transferred to the telemetry floor for further recovery.  Chest
tubes and pacing wires were discontinued without complication.
Neurology was consulted for the patient's history of Parkinson's
with generalized weakness/lethargy post-op. She was started on
Sinemet and became more alert and less rigid. Speech and Swallow
evaluated the patient for aspiration risk and diet modifications
were made.  The patient was evaluated by the physical therapy
service for assistance with strength
