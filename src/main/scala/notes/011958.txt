Admission Date:  [**2134-2-24**]     Discharge Date:  [**2134-3-1**]


Service:  [**Hospital1 **]

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 83 year old female
with a past medical history of Parkinson's with dementia,
stroke times two ([**2125**] and [**2133**] complicated by left
hemiparesis, slurred speech, and dysphagia), as well as
hypertension, diabetes mellitus, glaucoma, spinal stenosis,
GERD, depression who was admitted from [**Hospital3 2558**] with
fever and dyspnea times two days.  Per the patient's
daughter, patient had increased "gurgling," increased
hyperglycemia on finger stick blood glucoses, and anorexia
secondary to increasing dysphagia.  Patient lacks cough
reflex secondary to remote strokes and so did not have any
productive cough, but was noted to have increasing secretions
and confusion.  The patient was also noted to have "foul
smelling" urine by nursing home workers.  Patient was also
noted to have recent weight loss.  Prior to admission, the
patient's finger stick glucoses were noted to be greater than
500 and her temperature was measured at 101.6 on the evening
prior to admission.  In the Emergency Room, the patient was
noted to have a lactate of 6 and was sent to the Medical
Intensive Care Unit via the sepsis protocol and received
Vancomycin, Ceftriaxone, and Flagyl prior to transfer to the
Medical Intensive Care Unit.

resident, wheelchair bound.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Temperature 104.2; blood
pressure 157/56; pulse 106; respiratory rate 30; 95% on 2
liters by nasal cannula.  General:  This is a cachectic
elderly female in moderate distress.  Head, eyes, ears, nose
and throat:  No sinus tenderness, mucous membranes dry,
oropharynx without any lesions.  Neck:  Soft, supple, no
lymphadenopathy, no jugular venous distention.
Cardiovascular:  Tachycardic, normal rhythm with a grade [**3-12**]
holosystolic murmur at the apex.  Pulmonary:  Shallow
respirations with crackles on the left axillary line
anteriorly.  Abdomen:  Soft, non-tender, non-distended,
normal active bowel sounds, no rebound or guarding.  Back:
No costovertebral angle tenderness.  Extremities:  1+ pulses,
warm, no edema, no calf tenderness.  Neurological
examination:  Patient was non-verbal, pin point pupils
bilaterally, not following simple commands.

LABS ON ADMISSION:  White blood count 30.3; hematocrit 43.7;
platelets 391; sodium 153; potassium 6; chloride 114;
bicarbonate 28; BUN 63; creatinine 1.5; glucose 411; lactate
6.4; 89 neutrophils; 0 bands.  Urinalysis showed pH 5 with
moderate leukocyte esterase, 250 glucose, [**7-15**] red cells,
greater than 50 white cells, many bacteria.  Chest film
showed full lung volumes, no ..........., pleural effusions
or pneumothorax with a possible lingular infiltrate;
electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia at 105 beats per
minute with normal axis, normal intervals, borderline left
ventricular hypertrophy by voltage, no ST or T-segment
changes when compared with a prior electrocardiogram and no
T-waves.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Patient was begun on broad spectrum
antibiotics, initially started on Vancomycin, Ceftriaxone,
and Flagyl and later broadened to Levofloxacin for possible
pseudomonal infection, though none was documented.  Patient
was noted to have a metabolic acidosis with anion gap that
was presumably secondary to diabetic ketoacidosis on
admission and was begun on an intravenous insulin drip.  The
patient's anion gap closed.  The patient was converted to a
regular insulin sliding scale.  Patient was also noted to
have acute renal failure that was likely pre-renal in nature
with a creatinine elevation to 1.8 from her baseline of 0.8.
Her creatinine improved somewhat over the course of
hospitalization, it was 1.6 on transfer from the Medical
Intensive Care Unit to the general medical floor.  The
patient also was noted to have a significant pre-water
deficit and hyponatremia that was slowly corrected in the
Medical Intensive Care Unit and was 153 on transfer from the
Medical Intensive Care Unit to the general medical floor.

Patient was noted to be in ongoing significant respiratory
distress, presumably secondary to pneumonia as well as
congestive heart failure.  Patient was transferred from the
Medical Intensive Care Unit to the general medical floor on
the 24th.  Prior to transfer to the floor, a family meeting
was held and the decision was made to change the patient's
code status to "Do Not Resuscitate" "Do Not Intubate."
Patient was noted on the floor to have a temperature of 101
as well as worsening respiratory distress.  The patient's
oxygen saturation rate was 96% on 3 liters initially on
transfer to the medical floor, though subsequently, patient
developed a worsening oxygen requirement and was noted to
desaturate to 86% on 3 liters with a respiratory rate of 48
followed by the initiation of a non-rebreather with
improvement of her oxygen saturation rate to 90%.  Arterial
blood gases demonstrated significant hypoxemia with pH of
7.40, CO2 of 28, and an O2 of 69 on the non-rebreather.  The
patient was given 40 mg of intravenous Lasix for diuresis.

All intravenous fluids were discontinued as the patient was
felt to be in worsening congestive heart failure.  Given the
patient's "Do Not Resuscitate" "Do Not Intubate" status,
further discussions about the patient's level of care were
carried out with the patient's family and with the medical
team.  The patient's family, again, stressed the importance
of the patient's comfort and changed the patient's level of
care to comfort measures only.  Although, they decided that
they wanted to continue with antibiotics as well as diuresis,
though did want to have a morphine drip started for sedation
and discontinuation of any blood draws for further laboratory
analysis.

The patient expired on the [**4-1**] at approximately
1:30 a.m.  The family was present and was aware.  The
patient's attending, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], was notified.  The patient's
family declined postmortem examination.
