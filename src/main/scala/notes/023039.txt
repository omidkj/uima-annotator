CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Shortness of breath.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 44-year-old woman
who is transferred from an outside hospital with respiratory
distress.  She had previously been admitted to an outside
hospital on [**2200-5-31**] with a complaint of [**11-20**] chest pain,
vomiting x1, and nausea.  She was ruled out for a myocardial
infarction by enzymes at that outside hospital, and was then sent
to [**Hospital **] Hospital the following day due to persistent suicidal
ideations.

When the patient arrived at the [**Hospital1 **] Crisis Unit, she was
somnolent, dyspneic, tachycardic with a heart rate of 109, and
hypoxic with a room air oxygen saturation of 89%.  She was given
aspirin 81 mg po x1, furosemide 40 mg IV x1, and sublingual
nitroglycerin; she was then put in an ambulance and sent to the
[**Hospital1 69**].

On arrival to the [**Hospital1 69**], the
patient complained of shortness of breath and wheezing, although
she noted that her chest tightness had resolved. She was refusing
oxygen by nasal cannula and was found to have a room air oxygen
saturation of 94%.  Given the patient's somnolence, however, and
ABG was done; this study demonstrated a pH of 7.27, pCO2 of 77,
and pO2 of 57.  The patient was difficult to arouse and refused
BiPAP.

During the course of her evaluation in the Emergency Department,
it was learned that the patient's TSH was 63 at the outside
hospital on [**5-31**].  As noted below, she has a history of
hypothyroidism, but later admitted that she had not been taking
her medications over the past several weeks. Given her somnolence
and hypoxia, the patient was treated with intravenous
levothyroxine 400 mcg, as well as nebulizers and stress dosed
steroids.  Following these treatments, she was much more alert
and awake, and a repeat arterial blood gas demonstrated a pH of
7.34, PCT2 of 58, and pAO2 of 97.

On initial evaluation by the Medical service, the patient stated
that her breathing had improved substantially.  He complained of
a mild cough, but denied fever, chest pain, or other focal
complaints.  She did note feeling fatigued, and stated that she
was hungry.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Hypothyroidism.
2. Severe depression.
3. Suicidal ideations with multiple prior suicide attempts.
4. Alcohol abuse.
5. Crack-cocaine abuse with most recent use on [**2201-5-31**].
6. Obstructive-sleep apnea.
7. Asthma.
8. Psychosis.
9. Fungal skin infection.
10. Diabetes mellitus type 2.

ALLERGIES:  The patient states that she may have an allergy to
aspirin.

MEDICATIONS:  The patient was not taking any medications prior to
her admission to the hospital.  However, she states that she has
been previously taken sertraline 50 mg po q day, levothyroxine
225 mcg po q day, ibuprofen, and inhalers.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is homeless, and she has been living
in a truck for the four months prior to admission. She has an
extensive history of both cocaine and alcohol abuse.  She states
that she used intravenous heroin one time in the remote past, but
denies any other history of intravenous drug abuse.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On initial physical examination, the
patient's temperature was 97.9, heart rate 102, blood pressure
156/83, respiratory rate 19, and oxygen saturation is 90% on room
air.  Patient is morbidly obese woman who is sitting upright in a
chair, somnolent, but easily arousable, and was demanding food.
Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light.  Extraocular
movements are intact.  Mucous membranes moist.  She had normal
dentition.  Her neck was soft and supple.  She had very little
air movement on pulmonary auscultation, but did not have any
noticeable wheezes.  Her heart rate was tachycardic, but regular,
and there were no murmurs.  Her abdomen was soft, nontender,
nondistended and there were normoactive bowel sounds.  She had
trace bilateral lower extremity pitting edema to her knees and 2+
dorsalis pedis pulses bilaterally.  She had inframammary and
inguinal erythema on skin examination, but no other noticeable
rashes or skin lesions.

INITIAL LABORATORY EVALUATION:  White count of 13.3,
hematocrit of 42, and platelet count of 333,000.  A
differential of her white count demonstrated 68% neutrophils,
23% lymphocytes, 5% monocytes, and 2.4% eosinophils.  Her
initial INR was 1.1.  Initial serum chemistries demonstrated
a sodium of 140, potassium 4.4, chloride 97, bicarb 29, BUN
15, creatinine 0.8, and glucose of 128.  Initial CK was 54
and her initial troponin was less than 0.3.

Of note, laboratories from the outside hospital done on [**5-31**] demonstrated a TSH of 63, a free T4 of 3.9, and a T3
uptake of 25.  Her initial urinalysis from this hospital
demonstrated moderate leukocyte esterase, negative nitrate,
greater than 50 white blood cells, few bacteria, [**4-15**]
epithelial cells, 100 protein, no glucose or ketones, and
rare trichomonads.

Her initial chest x-ray demonstrated no obvious infiltrate,
poor inspiratory effort and mild vascular redistribution.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  By the morning following her admission, the
patient's clinical status was substantially improved.  She was
breathing comfortably and her oxygen saturation was 94% on room
air.  She continued to refuse oxygen by nasal cannula and BiPAP,
but she was continued on metered-dose inhalers and steroids.  She
was initially started on azithromycin for congestive obstructive
pulmonary disease exacerbation, but this medication was stopped
on hospital day two.

In terms of her pulmonary status, she was discharged with
inhalers as noted below, and a short course of steroids as noted
below.

Given that the patient was ruled out for myocardial infarction by
cardiac enzymes at the outside hospital, and given her absence of
significant electrocardiogram findings on admission to the [**Hospital1 1444**], she was not ruled out for a
myocardial infarction by cardiac enzymes here.  She was continued
on Telemetry during hospital days one and two without any
significant events.

Due to the patient's markedly elevated TSH at the outside
hospital, the Endocrinology service was consulted for their
recommendations for further management of her hypothyroidism.
Of note, her TSH here was found to be 64, and her free T4 was
0.6.  Overall, the Endocrine service agreed with the management
that had already taken place, and agreed to continue the patient
on the prior standing dose of levothyroxine 225 mcg po q day.

In terms of her diabetes, given her symptoms of congestive heart
failure, she was not deemed to be a good candidate for metformin
or a TZD at this time.  Because of her evidently poor glycemic
control, a Nutrition consult was recommended for outpatient
management of a diabetic diet, the nutritionist left materials
with the patient regarding how to eat a proper diabetic diet.

In addition, a hemoglobin A1C level was checked prior to
discharge, digoxin level was pending at the time of discharge,
but would certainly be expected to be high given the appearance
of poor glycemic control on an outpatient basis.

Given that the patient was transferred to the [**Hospital1 346**] from an inpatient psychiatric facility,
a Psychiatry service consult was requested.  During extensive
history taking, the Psychiatry service learned that the patient
has an extensive past psychiatric history, including major
depression, possible posttraumatic stress disorder, dissociative
disorder, not otherwise specified, and psychosis due to cocaine.
Patient has seen psychiatrist since she was a young girl, and
reported an early and chronic history of sexual abuse by her
stepfather, uncle, and other male relatives since age six.  She
has had multiple psychiatric admissions for episodes of
depression and multiple suicide attempts.  Her last
hospitalization was at [**Hospital1 1474**] earlier this month for a question
of depression and suicidal ideations.  She has had other
hospitalizations at [**Last Name (un) 883**], [**Hospital1 **], [**Hospital1 1474**], and [
