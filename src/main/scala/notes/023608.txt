History of Present Illness:
18 year-old male s/p multiple stab wounds to his head, face,
neck, right shoulder, right arm and abdomen. He was taken to an
area hospital where a right chest tube was placed which drained
about 100 cc of blood. He was then transported to [**Hospital1 18**] via
[**Location (un) 7622**]; he was hemodynamically stable upon arrival to the
Emergency department. On initial work-up, chest x-ray showed an
expanded right lung with a chest tube in place. His airway was
intact, although he had an anterior stab wound to the neck which
showed gurgling sounds of air emanating at inspiration. The fast
examination in the trauma bay was positive and he was taken to
the operating room immediately for an exploratory laparotomy
and repair of his mulitple injuries.

Imaging:
[**12-1**] CXR:  Pneumomediastinum.  Possible small right ptx.
Extensive subcutaneous emphysema, particularly of the shoulders
and neck.
[**12-2**] postop CXR: Small apical PTX on L.  Retrocardiac opacity
c/w atelectasis.  L brachiocephalic CVL passing across chest
into L brachiocephalic vein.
[**12-2**] CT head:  No IC hemorrhage or mass effect. Extensive soft
tissue emphysema of the neck which traverses fascial planes
[**12-2**] CT c-spine: No cervical spine fracture or malalignment.
Extensive subcutaneous and intramuscular emphysema throughout
the anterior neck which extends through fascial planes to
involve the prevertebral, masticator, and carotid spaces as well
as superior anterior mediastinum. The sites of penetrating
trauma are difficult to define given extent of emphysema. No
discrete hematoma is seen. Small biapical pneumothoraces.
[**12-3**]: CXR - No PTX, widening of the paraverterbral stripe
[**12-4**]: CXR - multifocal pneumonia, resolution of pneumo from
earlier in day
[**12-5**]: CXR - improved aeration of R lung, slight increase in
opacity in L mid lung.
[**12-6**]: CXR - (post WS) No PTX.  RM lung opacity unchanged.
Additional clearing in RUL, stable density LLL. No change in NGT
and trach position. Better aeration L mid lung.
[**12-7**]: CT neck/chest-Air collections-post-cricoid region/proximal
esophagus to R of midline, retropharyngeal space inferiorly into
the posterior superior mediastinum w/ air and soft tissue
density-mediastinitis. rim- enhancing collection in the

[**12-8**]: CXR-Patchy areas of opacification could well represent
pulmonary contusion or postoperative atelectasis. CVL placed.
[**12-12**]: CT neck/chest - soft tissue swelling, gas in the
prevertebral space, no fluid collect. Locules of gas in the
mediastinum c/w mediastinitis. no drainable collect. Liver lac.
[**12-13**]: CT c/a/p - no signif change from 1 day ago.  Extensive
mediastinal inflammatory change with fluid and gas with
mediastinal drain in place and no drainable fluid collection.
Unchanged extensive pneumonia of lower lobes bilaterally.
Unchanged hepatic lacerations with layering hematoma.  No
intra-abd or pelvic abscess
[**12-15**]: Bedside bronch by IP:  Tracheal anastamosis with
granulation tissue, no signif stenosis, site healing still
slightly friable.


Brief Hospital Course:
He was admitted to the Trauma Service and taken immediately to
the operating room for repair of his injuries; there was an
approximate 800 cc blood loss intraoperatively. Postoperatively
he was taken to the Trauma ICU for close monitoring. Thoracics
was consulted given his esophageal and tracheal injuries; he was
taken to the operating room on [**12-8**] for right VATS mediastinal
drainage, laparotomy with tube gastrostomy and tube jejunostomy,
cervical exploration and drainage and primary repair of trachea
and esophagus with a sternohyoid muscle flap buttress. There
were no intraoperative complications. On [**12-10**] he was extubated
without incident. He was taken back to the operating room on
[**12-15**] for a bronchoscopy in order to verify the anastomotic site
within the trachea. He was placed on IV antibiotics and will
need to continue the course for a total of 6 weeks following
repair.

His hematocrit began to drop; he underwent a tagged RBC scan on
[**2156-12-18**] which showed immediate pooling of tracer in the left
abdomen, likely within loops of
jejunum. Gastroenterology was consulted; he required blood
transfusions and was started on IV PPI twice daily. His
hematocrits were followed closely; Hct as of [**2156-12-30**] was 33.

He underwent an upper GI series on [**2156-12-27**] which showed no
evidence of esophageal leak. He was started on a clear liquid
diet and eventually upgraded to full liquids.

Infectious Disease was consulted for recommendations on home
antibiotics; it was recommended that he remain on Vancomycin and
Augmentin until follow up in [**Hospital **] clinic early [**Month (only) 958**].

Social work was involved early on due to the nature of his
traumatic injuries. The Center for Violence Prevention and
Recovery were consulted; he was provided with counseling
services post hospital discharge. He has been receiving Ativan
for anxiety associated with the assault and Ambien prn for
sleep.

He was evaluated by PT and determined to be independent with
functional activities. He will require skilled nursing at home
for overall respiratory, gastrointestinal/nutrition and
skin/wound assessments.
