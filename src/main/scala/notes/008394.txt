Allergies:
Dilantin

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 6114**]
Chief Complaint:
change in mental status, respiratory failure

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
intubation


History of Present Illness:
49 yo female with history of hepatitis C cirrhosis (grade II-III
with stage I dz, VL 3,500,000), severe emphysema requiring
several intubations, remote history of nasal cocaine, IVDU
(heroin) and alcohol, and recent seizures presented to ED with
changes in mental status and respiratory failure.

Brought to ED for change in mental status and soon after arrival
found to be cyanotic with sat 46% on room air, RR 6. The
patient's methadone dose had recently been increased secondary
to an interaction with dilantin.  The week prior to
presentation, the patient had developed a rash with the dilantin
and was switched to Keppra; however, the methadone dose had not
be reduced.  In the ED she was given narcane and was aroused but
was aggressive and required 4 point restraints.  She then became
somnolent again and was in respiratory distress, requirng
intubation and sedation. Prior to intubation her blood pressure
was 190/110.  For this she was started on a nitroglycerin drip
and post intubation started on propofol drip. She then became
hypotensive with systolic blood pressure in the 60s. The NTG was
stopped but BP did not resolve. Pt with 18 of auto-PEEP likely
contributing, and dehydrated with CVP 18. Inital blood gas on AC
vent settings of fio2 50%, PEEP 5, TV 550, rr 20 was 7.31/51/90.
She was treated with IVFs with no improvement in pressure. She
was given dopamine but would not tolerate due to tachycardia
with sinus tach and also SVT vs Aflutter.  She was then
transfered to the ICU.  CXR at that time showed bilateral
pulmonary infiltrates, hyperinflation, pulmonary artery
congestion.

Brief Hospital Course:
49F with history of Hepatitis C infection with cirrhosis, COPD,
seizures secondary to reversible leukoencephalopathy diagnosed
[**10-12**], and history of IVDU currently on methadone maintenance who
presented with respiratory depression secondary to COPD
exacerbation and nonintentional methadone overdose secondary to
drug-drug interactions resulting in hypoxic and hypercarbic
respiratory failure. During hospitalization the following
problems were addressed:
1. Respiratory Failure - Etiology for intial resp failure was
likely secondary to sedation from narcotic overdose in setting
of severe COPD. Given CXR, there was also likely a component of
flash pulmonary edema. The patient improved and was called out
to floor on [**11-24**], but returned to the MICU with lethargy and
decreased respiratory rate within two hours. She had received
methadone 50mg PO that morning.  She was continued on nebulizer
treatments for COPD exacerbation.  Methadone was dosed 20mg [**Hospital1 **]
x1 day, then 30mg QAM, 10mg QPM, then 40mg daily, which she
tolerated without evidence of oversedation or withdrawal.  She
was also treated with a week course of doxycycline for COPD
exacerbation.
3. Methadone Maintenance: methadone was dosed as described
above.  On the day prior to discharge, the patient developed
some agitation and elevated BP, SBP 150, which may have been a
withdrawal symptoms, but may also have been attributable to
anxiety or her nicotine patch.  She was without signs of
withdrawal on the day of discharge.
4. Hypotension:  The patient became hypotensive in the ED
requiring 7L IVFs, and BP normalized.  She received a stress
dose of steroids in the MICU, was changed to solumedrol, and
then tapered off on a short course of prednisone.  Blood
pressure stabilized, and on the day prior to discharge she
became hypertensive with SBP 150.  She was treated with
lopressor 12.5mg [**Hospital1 **].  In discuss, Her primary care provider
expressed concern about beta-blocker causing a COPD
exacerbation, and she was discharged to home on 12.5mg HCTZ.
She will follow-up with her PCP regarding blood pressure
control.
5. Seizures:  The patient has a history of recent onset of
seizures due to reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy.  She
was maintained on Keppra without any seizure activity.  She had
been discharged previously on Dilantin.  She then developed a
rash, presented to the ER, and was prescribed Keppra 500mg daily
to be increased to twice daily after two weeks.  She was
discharged to home on Keppra 500mg [**Hospital1 **], which she tolerated
during the hospitalization.  It was thought that her methadone
dose had been increased due to drug-drug interaction with
dilantin.  When she switched to Keppra, the dose of methadone
was not reduced accordingly, causing this overdose episode.
6.  Abdominal pain:  The patient noted RUQ extending to
mid-epigastric pain to palpation on exam when transferred to the
floor.  An ultrasound revealed gallbladder wall thickening and
edema, but not cholelithiasis.  She was afebrile and without any
nausea.  Surgery was consulted and felt the inflammation was due
to her chronic hepatic disease, and not an acute cholecystitis.
Liver function tests and pancreatic function tests remained
normal.  The pain was likely muscular due to coughing, or may
have been due to the small pleural effusion bilateral noted on
CXR, thought to be due to the heavy IVF load she received.  The
improved by the time of discharge such that there was pain with
deep palpation, with movement and coughing, but none at rest.
7.  Dispo:  She will follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 978**], PCP, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
in [**Hospital 3585**] clinic, and with the methadone clinic.  She was
provided with a letter for the methadone clinic stating what she
received regarding opioid treatment.  She is a full code.
