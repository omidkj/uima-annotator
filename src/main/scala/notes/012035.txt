Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 9157**]
Chief Complaint:
Fever, altered mental status


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
84yoF with HTN, migraines, and recent traumatic brain injury [**12-30**]
fall presents from her rehab center with altered mental status,
fever, transferred to the MICU for ?pneumonia.

The patient was recently in-house [**Date range (1) 90619**] for a fall down the
stairs resulting in traumatic brain injury resulting in a left
SDH, SAH, intraparenchymal hemorrhage, and intraventricular
hemorrhage as well as right occipital skull fracture, left
orbital roof fracture, retrobulbar hematoma, and multiple right
rib fractures [**3-6**].  During that hospitalization, she was also
treated with Augmentin for an enterococcal UTI which was
resistant to tetracyclines, and was to complete her course [**8-11**].
 She was also found to have elevated cardiac enzymes and an
akinetic distal LV which was diagnosed as likely stress induced
cardiomyopathy (Takotsubo cardiomyopathy) and she was started on
a beta blocker and diuresed per Cardiology consult
recommendations.

The patient was discharged to [**Hospital 38**] rehab, and had been
doing well until the day of admission, when she was noted to be
febrile to 101 with altered mental status.  A CT head was
obtained at the rehab facility on [**8-13**] which raised a concern
for an interval increase in the size of her prior L
intraparietal hemorrhage and concern for increased edema.  She
was sent to the ED for further evaluation.

In the ED, initial VS were:  97.8 116 128/78 38 97% 4L Nasal
Cannula
The patient was found to have altered mental status and did not
recognize her daughter in the [**Name (NI) **].  She titrated down to 2L NC.
She was febrile to 102 in the ED and CXR showed evidence of
received IV Vancomycin 1 gm, Cefepime 2 gm, Levofloxacin 500 mg.
 She was noted to have increased LLE edema and an LENI's showed
(+)LLE DVT.  Neurosurgery was notified that the patient was
admitted and reviewed the repeat head CT in the ED, but felt
that the ICH was decreased in size from previous scan on [**7-31**].
They asked to be formally consulted if a neurosurgically related
question arose.  EKG per ED report showed non-specific ST-TW
abnormalities compared to prior.  The patient received 2L NS,
Zyprexa 2.5 mg po x1, and was admitted to the MICU for pneumonia
and altered mental status.

On arrival to the MICU, the patient was comfortable laying in
bed and was disoriented but denied pain, including headache,
shortness of breath, or cough.

Review of systems:
(+) Per HPI otherwise negative.

IMAGING:
[**8-15**] CT head:
1. Interval evolution of left temporal lobe parenchymal
hemorrhage.
2. Acute on subacute left posterior cerebral SDH (8-mm).
Short-term followup
CT is recommended.
3. Trace residual SAH with small intraventricular hemorrhage.

[**8-15**] CXR:
Consolidations at both lung bases, new on the right concerning
for pneumonia. Left lower lobe consolidation could represent
atelectasis or pneumonia. Interstitial edema also noted.

[**8-15**] LENIs: 1. Occlusive thrombus throughout the interrogated
veins of the left leg.
2. No right leg DVT.

[**8-15**] CTA chest:
1. Extensive pulmonary embolism involving the right main
pulmonary artery,
extending into the lobar and segmental branches of the right
lower lobe, with likely a developing infarction of the right
lower lobe. Pulmonary embolism involving the anterior segmental
artery of the left upper lobe.
2. No evidence of right heart strain.
3. New thrombus within the left ventricle.
4. A small to moderate right pleural effusion, trace left
pleural effusion.
5. Large hiatal hernia containing a major portion of the
stomach.

[**8-16**] TTE: The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity
size. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are
normal. A 3x2cm mobile mass is seen along the distal
anteroseptal wall c/w thrombus. There is mild regional left
ventricular systolic dysfunction with focal hypokinesis of the
distal half of the anterior septum. The remaining segments
contract normally (LVEF = >55 %). Tissue Doppler imaging
suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure
(PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good
leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis. Trace aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears structurally
normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is no mitral
valve prolapse. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial
effusion.
