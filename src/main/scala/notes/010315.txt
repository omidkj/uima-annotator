[**6-24**] EKG
Narrow complex tachycardia which may represent accelerated
junctional
rhythm versus paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia. No P
waves are evident.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2106-6-1**] supraventricular
tachy-arrhythmia
is new.

appreciable right pleural effusion.


Brief Hospital Course:
Assessment and Plan: [**Age over 90 **]F with multiple hospitalizations for pna,
recent ESBL UTI presents with SOB and UTI.
.
# Respiratory failure: Intubated/extubated multiple times and
now is s/p successful extubation again yesterday.  Likely from
altered mental status in the setting of infection.  O2 sats now
97% on 2L NC and breathing comfortably.
- wean O2 as tolerated at rehab
.
# UTI:
- Change to bactrim given sensitivities; plan for 10 days (D1 =
[**6-26**])
.
# Anemia: Hct stable at 23 w/o signs of active bleeding.
.
# Stage 4 sacral decubitous ulcer
- Nursing care
- appropriate mattress and dressing changes
.
# GERD: PPI
.
# Paroxysmal afib: in SR on admission.
- continue amiodarone, full dose aspirin
.
#Bowel regimen and tylenol prn
.
# Code status: Ms. [**Known lastname 98899**] had been made DNR/DNI on last
admission.  This was reversed by her HCP on re-admission.  Two
attending physicians have said that CPR is not indicated and
that she should not be re-intubated in the future.  Her HCP was
agreeable to this plan.  If she were to have new respiratory
symptoms, goals of care should be switched to comfort measures.
She is once again DNR/DNI.
