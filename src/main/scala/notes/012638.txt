Pertinent Results:
[**3-16**] Echo: Prebypass: 1.The left atrium is elongated. No atrial
septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. 2.There is severe
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 50 %). 3.Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
4.There are simple atheroma in the ascending aorta. There are
simple atheroma in the aortic arch. There are simple atheroma in
the descending thoracic aorta. 5.The aortic valve leaflets are
severely thickened/deformed. There is severe aortic valve
stenosis (area <0.8cm2). Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
6.The mitral valve leaflets are moderately thickened. Moderate
(2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is mild tricuspid
stenosis (area >1.5cm2). There is a small to moderate sized
pericardial effusion. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1290**] was notified in person of
the results on [**2162-3-16**] at 930am. Post Bypass: 1. Patient is
being AV paced. 2. Anterior wall and anterior septum are
moderately depressed. 3. Bioprosthetic valve seen in the aortic
position. Leaflets move well and the valve appears well seated.
No aortic insufficiency present. 4. Aorta intact post
decannulation. 5. Mild mitral regurgitation present.
[**3-21**] CXR: Improved aeration bilaterally with decrease in
bilateral effusions. Left greater than right effusion and
retrocardiac atelectasis persist

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 30507**] was admitted preoperatively for further workup and
was cleared for surgery. On [**3-16**] he was brought to the operating
room and underwent aortic valve replacement and coronary artery
bypass graft surgery. Please see operative report for further
details. Following surgery he was transferred to the CVICU for
invasive management in stable condition. Later on op day he was
weaned from sedation, awoke neurologically intact and extubated.
Unfortunately immediately after extubation he had respiratory
distress and was re-intubated. On post-op day one he was again
weaned from sedation and re-extubated. His IV gtts were weaned
off later this day and was started on beta blockers and
diuretics. He was gently diuresed towards his pre-op weight. On
post-op day two his chest tubes and epicardial pacing wired were
removed. He did appear to have some sundowning overnight on
post-op day three. On post-op day three he to be stable and was
transferred to the telemetry floor for further care. He required
a sitter not only for sundowning at night, but for safety
reasons secondary to fall precaution. On post-op day five he had
a single episode of atrial fibrillation that was appropriately
treated and converted back to sinus rhythm. Due to the risk of
anticoagulation, and after a discussion with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3503**]
(covering for pt's cardiologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 30508**], it was decided
that he will not be anticoagulated for this.  He otherwise
continued to make a steady recovery and on post-op day six was
discharged to rehab facility with the appropriate medications
and follow-up appointments.
