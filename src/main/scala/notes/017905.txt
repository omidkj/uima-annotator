History of Present Illness:
66 y.o woman medical history significant for asthma and paranoid
schizophrenia who presented to the emergency room with right
upper quadrant pain and was found to be in atrial fibrillation
with an initial heartrate of 189.  The patient reports that she
had been feeling somewhat weak with nausea and subjective fevers
over the past 10 days as well as having RUQ pain over the past 3
days.  She also reports some dyspnea on exertion at her
baseline.

In the emergency room, the patient received multiple IV pushes
of diltiazem to a total of 50mg and was started on a diltiazem
drip initially at 10mg/hr, then up to 20mg/hr with poor response
and a rate continuing in the 150s.  The patient then received
metoprolol 10mg and developed bronchospasm with significant
wheeze, after which she received 125mg of solumedrol and a
single duoneb.  Cardiac enzymes were negative and imaging
including a right upper quadrant ultrasound and chest x-ray were
obtained.  RUQ was negative for cholecystitis and the CXR showed
only a small left pleural effusion.
.
The RUQ pain is not worsened by food, does not radiate, and is
currently only a [**2171-1-19**] from a [**10-27**] previously.
.
On review of systems, patient states she has a chronic
productive cough of white/clear sputum and admits to myalgias
especially left hip.  She denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, joint pains,
hemoptysis, black stools or red stools. She denies exertional
buttock or calf pain. She denies dysuria, hematuria, and
increased urinary frequency. All of the other review of systems
were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema,
palpitations, syncope or presyncope.
.
In the ED, prior to transfer T: 99.7, HR 155, BP 118/77, RR 30,

.
Studies:
CXR [**2171-10-21**] IMPRESSION: Left CP angle blunting could indicate
small effusion or atelectasis.
.
RUQ U/S [**2171-10-21**] IMPRESSION: Cholelithiasis without secondary
findings to suggest acute cholecystitis.
.
CARDIAC ECHO: [**2171-10-31**]:  The left atrium is mildly dilated. No
atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. The
estimated right atrial pressure is 0-5 mmHg. Left ventricular
wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic
function are normal (LVEF 75%). The estimated cardiac index is
high (>4.0L/min/m2). There is no ventricular septal defect.
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with
good leaflet excursion. There is no valvular aortic stenosis.
The increased transaortic velocity is likely related to high
cardiac output. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral
regurgitation. There is no mitral valve prolapse. There is mild
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
66 year old female with COPD, asthma, paranoid schizophrenia who
was found to have atrial fibrillation not responsive to rate
control in the ED.
.
# Atrial Fibrillation: Patient had asymptomatic afib in ED.   It
did not respond to IV diltiazem pushes or a maximal diltiazem
drip.  She was responsive to B-blocker but became brochospastic,
likely as a result of underlying asthma and COPD.  She received
nebulizers and steroids and her respiratory status subsequently
improved. Her rate was not controlled with diltiazem; she was
transitioned to Digoxin and Verapamil in the CCU. Rates ranged
130s-140s on this regimen. Of note, the patient was not a
candidate for cardioversion because she is not reliable for
followup or taking medications; Her CHADS2 score was 0 and so
she was maintained only on aspirin. On [**10-26**], she spontaneously
converted from afib to sinus rhythm with HR 80s. Digoxin was
held and Verapamil was continued with plans to continue as an
outpatient.   She was subseque
