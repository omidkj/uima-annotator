Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 6346**]
Chief Complaint:
Abdominal pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Incarcerated ventral hernia repair with mesh, diastasis
plication, and panniculectomy

History of Present Illness:
40 year old female with complex PMH significant for severe
morbid
obesity. Presented to OSH 2 months prior with concern for
incarcerated ventral hernia. Imaging revealed no incarceration,
however patient continues to experience significant pain and
disability related to hernia. Presents for herniorrhaphy ventral
w/ mesh. Consulted by surgical team for epidural placement for
post-operative pain management.

The patient is a very pleasant young woman with
a history of super morbid obesity with a BMI of 73.  She has
multiple medical problems.  Had had multiple cesarean
sections and developed a very painful anterior abdominal
bulge which was not reducible.  It was causing her severe
discomfort.  It was making it difficult for her to ambulate.
Outpatient CT demonstrated that there was incarcerated fat
and colon within the hernia sac, but there was no evidence of
ischemia or obstruction.  She was offered repair of that
hernia understanding the significant risk given her multiple
medical problems.  Consent was reviewed and signed on the
date of surgery, understanding that severe complications
outside of wound morbidity were possible.

Brief Hospital Course:
40 y/o F with known pulmonary hypertension secondary to obesity
hypoventilation syndrome with low oxygen saturation at baseline,
severe morbid obesity and decreased functional capacity
presented for repair of a large incarcerated bowel-containing
ventral hernia. The surgery itself went without complication,
however, post-operatively she remained intubated and was
transfered to ICU for low oxygen saturation/suboptimal
ventilation requiring mechanical ventilation.  In brief, her
hospital course was characterized by two codes during attempted
extubation in the perioperative period due to severe pulmomnary
hypertension with frequent desaturation, excessive PEEP
requirements (up to 36), a resistant pseudomonas ventilator
acquired pneumonia resulting in a prolonged endotracheal
intubation with slow wean with eventual tracheostomy on POD 39.

Neuro: She was initially sedated with midazolam drips, fentanyl
drips and intermittently paralyzed with cisatracurium as needed
for ventilation (when dysynchronous with the ventilator).  She
was monitored with BIS to try and help ensure sedation.  The
sedation was gradually weaned to off as of POD 24 with
intermittent fentanyl being used for pain control as needed
thereafter.  She grimaced to pain and was intermittently opening
her eyes initially but by the latter end of her hospital course
(POD 44) was awake and oriented and appropriately responsive.

Of note, she was noted to have what appeared to be a generalized
seizure on POD 38. The seizure was attributed to withdrawal from
benzodiazepines due to discontinuation of a rather heavy initial
benzodiazepine sedation requirement.
The neurology team consulted and recommended low dose ativan
around the clock with a slow wean.  She did not have further
seizures during this hospitalization.

Cardiac: She was initally on a number of different pressors
including norepinephrine, epinephrine, vasopressin and milrinone
which did help keep her blood pressures adequate. Several
echocardiograms were done which consistently showed right heart
strain.  A swan was also inserted on POD 7.   Her BP was
monitored with radial arterial lines.  She coded 3 times while
in the unit.  The first two described above (and in the
pulmonary section) and the third time on POD 8 following an
incident in she was being turned for nursing care.  The patient
became acutely hypoxic with saturations down to the low 40's for
about a 10 minute period of time.  She also became very
tachycardic with V tach noted on the monitor.  While the pads
were being charged to shock she spontaneously converted back to
sinus rythym, though tachycardic.  She was briefly started on an
epinephrine drip and slowly weaned  without incident.  She was
only briefly hypotensive during this time.  She did not have any
additional code or abnormal rythyms following the incidents as
mentioned above, but did remain low-grade tachycardic throughout
her hospitalization.  Please see the "Pulmonary" section for
further details.

Pulmonary: Ms. [**Known lastname 24642**] had severe pulmonary insuffiency
requiring ventilation with very high FiO2 and PEEP settings.
She was unable to wean off the ventilator post-operatively and
while in the SICU (2 failed attempts at extubation in the first
few post-operative days that involved desats, bradycardia,
hypotension ultimately leading to codes being called and
epinephrine and atropine given with stabilization).

She required very high PEEP levels -- which was at one point as
high as 36.  She had known pulmonary hypertension (thought to be
Pickwikian syndrome, obesity hypoventilation syndrome) and was
found to have significant pulmonary artery pressures (PA
pressures higher than arterial pressures at times by swan but
generally in the 90's systolic) and treated with sildenafil 40
TID.  The Pulmonology team was consulted to assist with her
pulmonary hypertension and her ventilatory status.  Lasix was
used in both bolus and drip dosing at various points during her
hospitalization to help with diuresis and to improve PA
pressures.

Her hospital course was characterized by her oxygen saturation
fluctuating between the high 90s and low 80s, with fluctuations
onset with small changes in positioning or other slight changes.
 Due to her tenuous respiratory status and excessive PEEP
requirement cardiac surgery was consulted early for
consideration of ECMO however she was deemed a poor candidate
given the high risk of complication given her body habitus.
When the PEEP was weaned to below 16, she was taken for
tracheostomy with the thoracic surgery team on POD 39.  Because
of her persistently high PEEP requirement and rather tenuous
respiratory status, interventional cardiology and cardiac
s
