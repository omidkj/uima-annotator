Pertinent Results:
[**Hospital1 18**] ECHOCARDIOGRAPHY REPORT
[**2119-1-16**] at 11:15:19 AM
LEFT ATRIUM: Dilated LA. No spontaneous echo contrast or
thrombus in the LA/LAA or the RA/RAA.
RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Normal RA size. No ASD by 2D or
color Doppler.
LEFT VENTRICLE: Mild symmetric LVH with normal cavity size and
regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.
AORTA: Normal [**Year (4 digits) 8813**] diameter at the sinus level. Focal
calcifications in [**Year (4 digits) 8813**] root. Normal ascending aorta diameter.
Focal calcifications in ascending aorta. Normal [**Year (4 digits) 8813**] arch
diameter. Focal calcifications in [**Year (4 digits) 8813**] arch. Normal descending
aorta diameter. Simple atheroma in descending aorta.
[**Year (4 digits) **] VALVE: Mildly thickened [**Year (4 digits) 8813**] valve leaflets (3). No AS.
No AR.
MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. No MVP.
Mild (1+) MR.
TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets with trivial
TR.
PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflet.
No PS. Physiologic PR.
PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.
Conclusions
PRE-BYPASS:
The left atrium is dilated. No spontaneous echo contrast or
thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium/left atrial
appendage or the body of the right atrium/right atrial
appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color
Doppler.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal
cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
There are focal calcifications in the [**Year (4 digits) 8813**] arch. There are
simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. The [**Year (4 digits) 8813**]
valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but [**Year (4 digits) 8813**] stenosis is
not present. No [**Year (4 digits) 8813**] regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no
mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in person of the results on Mr.[**Known lastname 8814**]
before surgical incision.
Post_Bypass:
Preserved biventricular systolic function. LVEF 50%.
Mild MR. [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **], tricuspid valves.
Intact thoracic aorta.


Brief Hospital Course:
Underwent cardiac evaluation for chest pain, which cardiac
catheterization revealed coronary artery disease.  He underwent
preoperative work up including labs which creatinine increased
to 1.9 post cardiac catheterization.  On [**2119-1-16**] he was brought
to the operating room and underwent coronary artery bypass graft
surgery.  See operative report for further details.  POD 1 found
the patient extubated, alert and oriented and breathing
comfortably.  He was neurologically intact and hemodynamically
stable on no inotropic or vasopressor support at this time.  He
was found suitable for transfer to telemetry.  Chest tubes and
pacing wires were discontinued without complication.  Physical
therapy was consulted for assistance with post-operative
strength and mobility.  The patient progressed as planned
through the cardiac surgery pathway without compication.  He was
discharged home in good condition on POD 4 after being cleared
for discharge by DR. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
