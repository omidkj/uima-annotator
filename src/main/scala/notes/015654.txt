Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1171**]
Chief Complaint:
weakness, left ankle pain, swollen legs

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
69 yo m with hx of systolic [**Last Name (LF) 19874**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] 15-20%, s/p CABG x2, s/p
MVR and tricuspid valve annuloplasty ring, PAF, and ITP who
presents with increased weakness and difficulty ambulating due
to left ankle pain. The patient states that he started to feel
weak about four days ago. He rose from his bed and noticed that
he felt very weak. Of note, he had difficulty walking on his
left ankle and it was very limited by pain. He did note
increased swelling in his legs and abdomen, however, his scale
did not show any weight gain. He claims that he's taking
Coumadin 5 mg only. He denies orthopnea, PND, dyspnea, fevers,
chills, cough, n/v, black tarry stools, bright red blood per
rectum, headache, blurry vision.
.
He was recently admitted [**Date range (1) 45928**] for a heart failure
exacerbation. His INR at that time was elevated. He was diuresed
aggressively and sent home. He presented once again to the
hospital because he had an elevated INR>20 and in the ER, he was
also found to be in acute on chronic renal failure. His lasix
and aldactone were held at the end of admission and he was given
vitamin K to reverse his INR. He was sent home with a normal INR
and had an INR check and f/u with cardiology. Cardiology started
him on lasix and aldactone and kept the rest of his medications
the same.
.
Since the patient could not walk, he came to the hospital. In
the ER, his vital signs were T: 99.5, BP: 116/77, HR: 96, RR:
18, O2 sat: 100% RA. The patient had a CXR which showed mild
pulmonary vascular congestion with small bilateral pleural
effusions and a retrocardiac opacity likely represents
atelectasis, although underlying infection cannot be excluded.
His INR was also found to be elevated >20. He had xrays of his
left ankle and tibia which showed "no acute fracture." EKG
showed atrial fibrillation at 98 bpm with LVH, intraventricular
conduction delay and overall no changes from prior. The patient
received Lasix 20 mg IV and Vitamin K 10 mg PO and was
transferred to the floors.

Brief Hospital Course:
# Acute exacerbation of systolic heart failure: The patient
presents with fluid overload, especially in the lower
extremities. He has been compliant with his lasix and aldactone.
He noticed his legs swelling, but he said his weight hasn't
increased. He has been keeping to his fluid restriction. The
patient was started on his home lisinopril. The patient was
started on lasix boluses, however his hypotension limited his
diuresis. Since he was hypotensive to SBP: 80s-90s, his
lisinopril was decreased to 2.5 mg. He was started on a lasix
drip for more gentle diuresis, which proved ineffective with
even I&Os. He was admitted to the CCU with the intention of
ionotrope assisted diuresis in the setting of persistent
hypotension. Vigorous diuresis was achieved with aggressive
lasix drip without the need for ionotropes with the patient
found to be asymptomatic from stable blood pressures in the 90s
systolic. His lisinopril was held as this worsened his
hypotension. The patient was transferred out of the CCU to the
cardiac floor. His lasix drip was continued with further
diuresis. The patient's weight plateaued, so metalozone was
started which assisted with his diuresis. Low dose captopril
(3.125 mg TID) was added. Any attempt to uptitrate the captopril
caused hypotension. The was switched to Lasix IV pushes and then
to torsemide in which the patinet continued to gain weight.
Since there was difficulty in diuresing the patient, the patient
was transferred to the CCU for ionotropic assisted diuresis. In
the CCU, his lasix gtt was increased, and his urine output
subsequently increased. He was subsequently transfered back to
the cardiology floor were lasix gtt was continued with good
response. Once his weight reached his dry weight of <140 lbs,
lasix gtt and metolazone were stopped, he was started on
torsemide 40 mg and continued on spironolactone 25 mg [**Hospital1 **]. His
weight on discharge was 138 lbs.
.
# Acute on chronic renal failure: The patient presented with a
creatinine of 2.2, higher than his baseline of 1.2. Was on
aldactone 25 and Lasix 40 mg PO at home. This was thought to
represent pre-renal azotemia given his low ejection fraction and
CHF exacerbation. With aggressive diuresis (as above), his
creatinine improved to baseline. On the floor, the patient was
continued on the lasix drip and again developed acute renal
failure with his Cr increasing to 1.5-1.6 and stabilizing in
that range.
.
# Coagulopathy: The patient presented with an INR above 20.2.
His elevated INR was likely due to hepatic congestion secondary
to CHF. The patient was given Vitamin K 10 mg IV in the ER and
his INR corrected to 1.8. He continued his warfarin for a goal
of [**2-27**] t
