Chief Complaint:
right thigh pain, wound infection

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
s/p Hip IR drainage

History of Present Illness:
44M with history of asthma s/p hemiarthroplasty [**10/2198**] after R
hip fracture in MVC, at [**Hospital1 18**] [**11-12**] for R hip resection
arthroplasty c/b prosthetic joint infection.  Instead he had
resection of the hemiarthroplasty with irrigation and
debridement followed by antibiotic spacer placement.  Pt
received Vancomycin and Cefazolin perioperatively.  Cultures
were negative and no pathogen was identified however based on
previous culture data of MRSA and CoNS from a superficial wound
infection in [**2198**], the pt was put on Vancomycin for a planned 6
week course, switched to Dapto due to difficulty maintaining a
therapeutic vancomycin level.

Doing well at [**Hospital3 **] until 2 days ago wtih increased
pain in his right thigh wth increasing redness at R hip site.
Per report had 2 fluid collections on u/s at [**Hospital1 **].  He had
been on Vancmycin but switched to Daptomycin 600mg IV 124h by
OPAT [**3-6**] subtheraputic vanco levels.

R Hip Xray [**11-30**]: Overall, there is no significant change since
[**2199-11-20**]. The patient is status post Girdlestone-type
procedure. A rounded sphere of methyl methacrylate is
demonstrated within the acetabulum. Additional methyl
methacrylate extends along the shaft of the proximal femur.
Alignment is similar.  Cortication is unchanged with no erosion
to suggest new osteomyelitis.

RLE U/S [**11-30**]: FINDINGS: There is a superficial ill-defined
fluid collection measuring 2.5 x 0.8 x 1.3 cm beneath the
incision. There is no surrounding hyperemia. Few echogenic
debris are seen within this collection. IMPRESSION: Small
non-organized fluid pocket just beneath the right knee incision
site without defined wall or surrounding hyperemia. No
definitive abscess.

U/S [**12-2**]
FINDINGS: Again noted is a fluid collection in the soft tissues
of the right lateral thigh distal to the inferiormost cutaneous
stitch measuring 1.1 x 1.0 x 1.4 cm in size. No significant
vascularity is seen. Since previous study this collection
appears more echogenic.
IMPRESSION: Slight interval decrease of fluid collection in the
right lateral thigh. It appears more echogenic since previous
study and may represent an
organizing hematoma. No definitive abscess seen.

Brief Hospital Course:
44 year old male with h/o right hemiarthroplasty in [**10-12**]. Came
back to have conversion to THR but when went to OR in [**11-12**]
found to have a pocket of purulent fluid, resulting in resection
hemiarthroplasty and antibiotic spacer placement. There has been
no positive culture data.  He has been maintained on IV
daptomycin for treatment of the infection and requiring high
doses of pain medications.  He was rehospitalized on [**2199-11-29**]
for worsening R hip pain.

During this hospitalization, [**11-30**] ultrasound showed a 2.5 cm
fluid collection concerning for seroma of phlegmon.  Repeat US
with IR aspiration, resulted in 1cc fluid removal sent for gram
stain and culture.  He was continued on Daptomycin.  Shortly
post the procedure after receiving his chronic pain regimen, he
was found to be somnolent, and apenic with oxygen saturations to
~70%. A code blue was called. The patient never lost a pulse and
BP remained stable throughout. An initial ABG on facemask was
6.92/137/88. Received 0.5mg of narcan with rapid return to
spontaneous breathing and some improvement in mental status. The
patient then becamge agitated, with HR into the 130s and began
to desaturate into the 70s. He had coarse, rhoncorous breath
sounds. Intubated for airway protection.  He was transferred to
the ICU.  He was started on propofol which resulted in
hypotension briefly requiring pressors.  He was started on
vancomycin, cefepime, flagyl  empirically for aspiration
pneumonia.  However, his respiratory status quickly improved and
he was extubated within 24 hours.  Antibiotics were changed back
to IV daptomcyin. His ICU stay was also notable for ARF with
creatinine rise to 1.3 from baseline of 0.7 which improved with
fluids.
.
He continued to improve on the dapto and decreased dosing of
pain medication.  Cultures remained neg during hospitalization
and he will be treated for app 6 weeks with daptomycin and
follow up with [**Hospital **] clinic and ortho clinic.  He was discharged to
a rehab facility for continued care/rehab.
.
FOLLOW UP ISSUES

CARE

HIS PAIN MEDS SHOULD BE INCREASED SLOWLY.
