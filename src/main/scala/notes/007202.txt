Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 67 year old female with multiple medical problems
including COPD on 2L home O2 and diastolic CHF, CAD s/p stents,
DM, HTN, PVD s/p b/l amputations, presenting  with 4 days of
increased sleepiness, SOB, and orthopnea. She was initially
admitted to the ICU given ABG of 7.43/67/103 (prior ABG in past
had shown CO2 of 40s, but last one had been in [**2181**]). Initial O2
sat was 100% on 2L NC.
.
# CHF Exacerbation, acute on chronic diastolic EF 60%:
Exacerbating factors could have been poorly controlled HTN as
well as recent decrease in lasix. The patient reports compliance
with taking her lasix and eating a low salt diet. The patient
had 2 negative sets of cardiac enzymes and her EKG was at her
baseline. Chest xray showed no acute change. Her initial SBP on
admission was elevated in the 160s. She received IV lasix 80mg
IV in ED with 800cc urine response, and additional 40mg IV on
admission to the ICU with negative fluid balance of 1.4L. She
had been satting 100% on 2L upon admission to the ICU. She was
also started on CPAP at night in the ICU given concern that OSA
could be worsening her heart failure. She was called out of the
unit the following day. She was continued on Lasix 40 mg IV
twice daily for another 2 days on the floor.  She was fluid
restricted to 1.2 L a day, and she was continued on her
lisinopril, statin, and imdur. Her metoprolol was titrated up to
37.5 mg three times a day for improved blood pressure control.
On HD 4, the pts bicarb was 41, and she felt dizzy with nausea.
She was felt to be adequately, and likely over, diuresed. Her IV
diuresis was discontinued, and she was restarted just on Lasix
80 mg daily oral. This however was stopped after the patient
became hypotensive as per below. Her Lasix will be held until
follow up with her PCP.
.
# Hypotension: The patient became hypotensive to the 90s with
dizziness and nausea/vomiting on [**8-31**]. This was felt to be due
to overdiuresis. There is some question as to dietary and
medication compliance as the patients fingersticks also dropped
on her home lantus regimen and her blood pressure dropped with
her home blood pressure regimen. Alternatively, it is also very
possible that her new CPAP regimen at night has been drastically
improving her blood pressure and fluid status. All of her blood
pressure medications and lasix were held on [**9-1**]. She was gently
rehydrated with IVF and her SBP rose up to 130s. On the day of
discharge, the pts SBP was in the 90s to low 100s (asymptomatic)
and it was decided to decrease the pts lisinopril to 10 mg daily
and hold her lasix until follow up with her PCP.
.
# COPD: No evidence of exacerbation. Patient appears at baseline
HCO3, O2 requirement. Received IV solumedrol 125mg in ED,
further steroids were held. She was continued on  tiotropium,
albuterol prn. Salmeterol was started as the pt often had mild
wheezing on exam. A follow up appointment with a new pulmonary
doctor was made, as her last PFTs were in [**2180**].
.
# Groin Rash: This appeared fungal. She was treated with 3 days
of oral fluconazole as she had failed topical treatments.
.
# Diabetes Mellitus, insulin dependent, controlled, without
complications: The patients fingersticks in the ICU were in the
300s, but she had not been given her lantus. On the floor her
fingersticks dropped to the 50s-70s on her home regimen of
lantus 64 units QHs, humalog SS. She was seen by [**Last Name (un) **] and it
was recommended to decrease her lantus to 58 U at night. Her
fingersticks were still low, so her final regimen was adjusted
