Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2291**]
Chief Complaint:
dyspnea, tachycardia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**4-4**] Attempted TEE, failed
[**4-6**] TEE with cardioversion


History of Present Illness:
65YM h/o DVT, DM c/b neuropathy presenting with DOE found to
have multiple pulmonary emboli.
.
Per patient had been in USOH when developed worsening of breath
over the last 3-4days. Developed in the setting of rhinorrhea so
patient thought symptoms reflective of URI so treated
symptomatically.
In last 2 days developed worsening dyspnea on exerion with
labored breathing after walking only a block. He reported
associated chest tightness, pleuritic CP with deep breath as
well as diaphoresis. Symptoms prompted presentation to PCP
[**Name Initial (PRE) 3011**]. In PCP's office EKG demonstrated Aflutter. Patient
received Lovenox 100mg in setting of arrhythmia and instructed
to present to the ED.
.
In the ED, initial VS: 98.6 83 103/40 18 98% 2L Nasal Cannula.
EKG: aflutter@ 107, NA, NI. Patient received ASA 325. Labs with
BNP 347, trop <0.01. CTA with PE involving RUL, RML, RLL,
lingula, and LLL - no evidence of pulmonary infarct or R heart
strain. Started on heparin ggt without bolus (has already
received Lovenox). HR noted to elevate to 110sin flutter with
exertion. Due to c/o SOB and labile HRs decision made to admit
to the MICU overnight for monitoring.  Hemodynamics prior to
transfer: 145/90 HR: 100 in aflutter.
.
On arrival to the MICU, patient with continued complaint of
chest tightness and intermittent SOB. Denies palp, n/v.
.
Regarding history of DVT, per patient reports two instances
during which he was treated for coumadin in setting of DVT. Both
thromboembolic events occurred in the context of lower extremity
surgeries. Per patient last clot ~3-4years ago. Has been off
anticoagulation for several years.
He is uptodate with cancer screening; last c-scope [**2175**] during
2which benign polyps were removed. No B sx with excpetion of
sweats in acute setting. No family history of clot. No recent
immobilizations, recent car trips.

IMAGING:
admission ECG:
Atrial flutter with variable A-V block. Possible inferior wall
myocardial
infarction of indeterminate age. Poor R wave progression,
probably normal
variant. No previous tracing available for comparison.
.
CTA chest:
1. Extensive pulmonary emboli as described above without
evidence of right
heart strain or pulmonary infarct although perfusion
abnormalities are
suspected in each lung.
(Filling defects are present in the segmental and subsegmental
branches of the left lower lobe pulmonary artery, lingular
branch of the left upper lobe pulmonary artery, branches of the
right lower lobe pulmonary artery, right middle lobe pulmonary
artery and right upper lobe pulmonary artery.)
2. Right upper lobe ground-glass nodule of 13 mm and additional
smaller
nodules. Follow-up chest CT is recommended in six months for
surveillance.
3. Suspected bony demineralization and mild loss in height among
several
lower thoracic vertebral bodies.
.
LENIs: IMPRESSION: Near occlusive left popliteal venous
thrombosis.
.
TTE:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. The left atrium is
elongated. The right atrium is moderately dilated. The estimated
right atrial pressure is 0-5 mmHg. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%)
secondary to very mild global hypokinesis. Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The ascending
aorta is mildly dilated. The number of aortic valve leaflets
cannot be determined. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears
structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is
borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Biatrial enlargment. Low normal left ventricular
systolic function. No significant valvular disease. Borderline
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. Mild ascending aorta
dilatation.
.
TEE [**4-4**]
Findings
The TEE probe was passed to 50 cm. The heart was unable to be
adequately visualized due to poor contact between the probe and
the esophagus despite multiple attempts and probe maneuvers. The
procedure was aborted.
GENERAL COMMENTS: Informed consent was obtained. A TEE was
performed in the location listed above. I certify I was present
in compliance with HCFA regulations. The patient was monitored
by a nurse [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 9833**] throughout the procedure. The patient
was monitored by a nurse [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 9833**] throughout the procedure.
The patient was sedated for the TEE. Medications and dosages are
listed above (see Test Information section). The posterior
pharynx was anesthetized with 2% viscous lidocaine. 0.2 mg of IV
glycopyrrolate was given as an antisialogogue prior to TEE probe
insertion. No TEE related complications. Suboptimal image
quality - poor echo windows. Suboptimal image quality - body
habitus. Image quality was suboptimald - poor esophageal
the patient.
Conclusions  IMPRESSION: Unsuccessful TEE.
.
TEE [**4-7**]
The left atrium is mildly dilated. No spontaneous echo contrast
or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium/left atrial
appendage or the body of the right atrium/right atrial
appendage. Right atrial appendage ejection velocity is good (>20
cm/s). No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF
50-55%). There are simple non mobile atheroma in the aortic arch
and descending thoracic aorta to 40 cm from the incisors. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears structurally
normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is no mitral
valve prolapse. There is no pericardial effusion.
