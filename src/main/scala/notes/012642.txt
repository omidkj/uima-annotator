Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4219**]
Chief Complaint:
Transfer from [**Hospital 1562**] Hospital for necrotizing pneumonia.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
1. Endotrachial intubation
2. Bronchoscopy
3. Central venous line placement


History of Present Illness:
This is a 62 year old man admitted to OSH on [**3-14**] with
SOB/fevers/cough/sputum production/hypoxemia/confusion, found to
have right upper and lower lobe pneumonia.  Initially tried on
BiPAP but did not tolerate so was intubated. Yellow secretions
were suctioned out. Empirically treated with Unasyn and
levofloxacin, linezolid, and azithromycin. Underwent
bronchoscopy on [**3-14**] which revealed R upper lobe edema, friable
tissue, and old bleeding.  No biopsy was obtained, but washings
contained alpha-strep. A chest CT showed persistent dense RUL
opacity with bulging fissures and some areeas of early
necrotizing change vs. cystic bronchiectasis changes. Pt.
afebrile over the last three days.  WBC initially 21.3, down to
9.0 on [**3-21**]. Transferred on SIMV rate 18, PS 15, PEEP 10 FiO2
0.6. Pt's Abx were changed to ceftriaxone 1g q24 and clindamycin
600mg q8h. Pt. has a #8 ETT, NGT, RIJ (placed [**3-14**]).
Transferred for evaluation for biopsy/lobectomy.  According to
daughters, Pt. had a viral URI type illness two weeks ago. Also
they have noticed some weight loss over the past year.

2. h/o EtOH abuse
3. ?DM
4. hypothyroidism
5. h/o Hashimoto's thyroiditis

IMAGING:
CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2138-4-3**] 6:13 PM
Comparison with [**2138-3-31**]. Endotracheal tube has been removed.
A right- sided PICC seen terminating near distal brachiocephalic
vein. Right upper lobe appears consolidated, with volume loss.
Cavitation again suggested. No new areas of consolidation.
Cardiac, mediastinal, hilar contours are unchanged. No pleural
effusions. There are large air-filled loops of bowel seen.
IMPRESSION: Stable appearance of right upper lobe consolidation
with cavitation. Remainder of lungs appears better aerated.
.
EKG [**4-1**]
Sinus rhythm. Normal ECG. No previous tracing available for
comparison.

.
CT CHEST W/CONTRAST  [**2138-3-27**] 11:56 AM
CT OF THE CHEST: Again seen is a large area of consolidation
with foci of air within the right lower lobe. The surrounding
right pleural effusion of simple fluid attenuation has increased
in size since the prior study. The multiple foci of ground-glass
opacity in the right upper lobe are stable or possibly slightly
improved. Heart and pericardium appear unremarkable apart from
calcifications of the coronary arteries. Again seen are
prominent right paratracheal lymph nodes, unchanged. Small
amount of atelectasis is seen at the left base. Emphysematous
changes are seen in the left lung. The great vessels appear
unremarkable apart from calcifications of the aorta. The airways
are grossly patent. An endotracheal tube and a nasogastric tube
are visualized again.

CT OF THE ABDOMEN: The liver, adrenal glands, spleen, and
pancreas appear unremarkable. Again seen are small gallstones
within the full gallbladder. There is no pericholecystic fluid
or gallbladder wall edema. No pathologic mesenteric or
retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy is identified. The kidneys
enhance and excrete contrast symmetrically. Minor nonspecific
stranding are seen around the kidneys. Visualized loops of small
and large bowel are normal in caliber and contour. There is no
free air or free fluid in the abdomen. The vascular structures
demonstrate calcification of the arteries.

CT OF THE PELVIS: A Foley catheter is seen within the bladder.
There appears to be a rectal tube in place. The prostate and
seminal vesicles appear unremarkable. The pelvic loops of small
and large bowel appear unremarkable. There is a small amount of
nonspecific stranding within the pelvis. There is no free fluid
within the pelvis. The osseous structures demonstrate no
concerning lytic or sclerotic lesions.

IMPRESSION:
1. Stable appearance to the abnormalities within the right lung
as described above. Slight increase in the size of the right
pleural effusion of simple fluid attenuation.
2. Cholelithiasis, without evidence of cholecystitis.
.
UNILAT UP EXT VEINS US LEFT  [**3-25**]: No evidence of subclavian
artery pseudoaneurysm or hematoma within the imaged portion of
the vessel. However, please note that ultrasound is unable to
evaluate the entire course of the subclavian vessels.
.
CT CHEST W/CONTRAST  [**2138-3-23**] 9:12 PM
There is a consolidative opacity with multiple foci of air
involving the right lower lobe. Throughout the right middle lobe
as well as part of the right upper lobe are peribronchial
ground-glass opacities. There is atelectasis at the left lung
base. The left lung is otherwise relatively spared with only two
small foci of ground-glass opacities in the apex identified. The
patient is intubated and a nasogastric tube tip is seen coiling
within the stomach. The heart, pericardium and great vessels
appear unremarkable apart from extensive arterial
calcifications. There is a small right-sided pleural effusion
measuring simple fluid attenuation. There is no pathologically
enlarged axillary lymphadenopathy. Multiple borderline enlarged
lymph nodes are seen in the right hilum and the precarinal
regions.

The visualized abdominal organs demonstrate extensive
calcification of the splenic artery. The visualized liver,
spleen, pancreas, and adrenal glands appear unremarkable. There
are small gallstones. The osseous structures appear
unremarkable.

IMPRESSION:
1. Extensive consolidative opacity involving the right lower
lobe with multiple foci of air within it. This is consistent
with the diagnosis of necrotizing pneumonia. There is an
associated small right pleural effusion of simple fluid
attenuation. There are multiple foci of ground-glass opacities
in the right upper lobe as well as the right middle lobe, which
could be infectious in etiology as well.
