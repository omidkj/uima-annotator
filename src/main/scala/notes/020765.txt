History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 73yo female with PMH significant for CAD, PAD,
CVA and DM who is being transferred from the ICU. She initially
presented on [**1-2**] to [**Hospital3 3583**] with fever and confusion.
At the OSH she was given Cetriaxone for questionable pneumonia.
On transfer to [**Hospital1 **] she was found to be hypotensive with SBP in
the 90's and febrile with T~102.8. She had leukocytosis of 15.0
and an elevated lactate of 4.3. She received 4-5L of NS,
Vancomycin and Flagyl in the ED and a lumbar puncture was done
which was negative. She was transferred to the ICU for
sepsis/SIRS with no indentifiable source of infection.

In the ICU her blood pressure quickly stabilized with IVFs. She
has remained afebrile since she was transferred from the ED. Her
antibiotic regimen was changed to Levoquin, Flagyl, Primaquine &
Clindamycin (for PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 21150**]).

Per patient she had not been feeling well on the day of
admission to the OSH. She had an uneasy feeling in her stomach.
She admits to an episode of loose stools last Friday and then
had a large BM yesterday on transfer to the ED. She has not had
any more BMs since then. She denies any SOB, chest pain,
dizziness, nausea, vomiting, fevers, or chills at home. She does
note that she has not been feeling well overall for the past
several months.

Relevant Imaging:
1)Cxray ([**1-3**]):Increased effusions are noted compared to the
prior study with some mild increase in interstitial markings but
no new focal consolidation

2)CT scan abdomen & pelvis ([**1-2**]): Bilateral pleural effusions
and atelectasis versus aspiration. Interstitial prominence at
the lung bases suggestive of pulmonary edema.

3)LE doppler ([**1-6**]): No evidence of deep venous thrombosis in
either lower extremity.

4)ECHO ([**1-8**]): The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left
ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%). The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is mild pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 74 yo female with MMPs as listed above who
initially presented with fever and hypotension and met SIRS
criteria, now being transferred from the ICU to the medical
floor.

1) Hypotension: Likely became hypotensive in the context of
possible occult infection given her leukocytosis, elevated
temperature, and her lactic acidosis. There was no identifiable
source of infection. No consolidation on cxray, U/A negative,
and blood cultures remained negative during her stay. Her blood
pressure slowly normalized upon transfer to the medical floor
after having received liters of fluid in the ICU.
Anti-hypertensives were initially held but then restarted at
time of discharge.

2) Fever, leukocytosis: There appears to be no clear source of
infection based on the imaging and culture data. Given her
recent history of loose stools and "uneasy feeling" in her
stomach c. diff was entertained. She has also been on steroids
for several months and given her elevated LDH and new O2
requirements, PCP was also on the initial differential. He had
bilateral pleural effusions on CT scan and was started on
Levoquin, Flagyl, Clindamycin, Primaquine in the ICU. Blood
cultures remained negative. Levoquin and Flagyl were continued
on the medical floor but Flagyl was then stopped.

3) Hypoxia: Patient found to have new oxygen requirement upon
transfer to medical floor. [**Month (only) 116**] be secondary to atelectasis and
bilateral effusions shown on cxray. No evidence of pulmonary
edema on cxray and clinical exam. ECHO was done with no major
changes from prior study. She underwent agressive chest PT and
was given an incentive spirometer.

4) CAD: Patient presents with no chest pain or signs of
myocardial ischemia on this admission. No new EKG changes. She
had not been taking her Plavix for 1 week and was initially held
on admission for steroid injection she will be receiving on
Tuesday. She was given one dose in the ICU with recommendations
to restart after the steroid injection.

5) Diabetes: Patient on insulin (Glargine & Regular)at home. She
was continued on home regimen but [**1-6**] the dose since she was
NPO. She was restarted on regular regimen at time of discharge.

6)Chronic pain: Patient has pain in her lower extremities
secondary to diabetic amytrophy. Given the severity of her pain,
the pain service was consulted. She was started on Pregabalin
and Methadone with mild improvement in her symptoms. She was
also scheduled for steroid injection but had to be postponed
since she had received Plavix in the ICU. Plavix was held for
the remainder of her admission until she was seen in the pain
clinic as an outpatient.

7) PAD: No current issues. S/P fem-[**Doctor Last Name **] bypass x2.

8) CVA: no acute CVA and neuro exam without focal deficit

9) Seizure: Ct Keppra and Topamax

10) Hypothyroid: Ct outpatient regimen of Synthroid

11)Depression: Ct outpatient regimen of Seroquel
