History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 62 yo M with no significant past medical
history per his wife. [**Name (NI) **] was admitted to [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] Science
Benevolent Association facility approx 6 weeks ago for urinary
retention. Staff at this facility assisted him with eating and
toileting. He has not had any medical care for this issue. Per
family, he went to this facility because of problems with
hematuria and urinary retention.  He has also had trouble
ambulating for multiple weeks and was complaining of lower back
pain. Per his family, over course of last week, mental status
slowly declined, pt would "drift off," became sleepy but
arousable, still communicating. This worsened in the leading up
to admission and on day of admission patient was unable to take
anything by mouth and was sent to the emergency department.

In the emergency department, patient was febrile, tachycardic,
and demonstrated altered mental status and combative behavior. A
foley catheter was placed and was clamped after 1 liter of urine
was released. Initial vitals: T 101.4, HR 136, BP 138/110, RR
18, sat 94. Of note, lactate 4.4, Na 167, WBC 28.1, Hct 33 (no
baselines for comparison). He was empirically treated with
vancomycin, levaquin, flagyl, tylenol, haldol, and morphine (to
facilitate CT). He received a total of 4 L normal saline,
followed by initiation of [**12-7**] normal saline at 250cc/hr per
renal service recommendations. Total urine output in ED was 3.8
liters.

CYTOLOGY: URINE [**2197-9-11**]
 Atypical keratinizing squamous cells.
 	Atypical urothelial cells.
 	
 	Note: The squamous cells display hyperchromatic angulated
 	nuclei. The differential diagnosis includes urothelial
 	carcinoma with squamous differentiation, squamous cell
 	carcinoma, squamous dysplasia and metaplasia.

IMAGING STUDIES:

CT HEAD [**2197-9-11**]:
FINDINGS: There is no evidence of hemorrhage, edema, masses,
mass effect, or
infarction. The ventricles and sulci are normal in caliber and
configuration.
There are no fractures identified. The sinuses are clear. Two
destructive
bony lesions are seen in the occipital bones which are
concerning for
metastatic disease. These are seen on series 2, images 15 and
24.

IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence for hemorrhage or masses.
2. Destructive bony lesions in the occipital bones, concerning
for metastatic
disease.

CT ABDOMEN/PELVIS [**2197-9-11**]
CT OF ABDOMEN WITHOUT CONTRAST: The visualized lungs are clear
without nodule
or masses. There are no pleural effusions. The heart is normal
in appearance
without pericardial effusion. There is a 3.9 x 3.5 cm soft
tissue mass in the
right posterior chest wall causing a convex bulge along the
right posterior
pleura. This lesion which is arising from the right 12th rib is
compatible
with metastasis (2:11). An enlarged lymph node is seen in the
posterior
mediastinal space on S2, I2, measuring 1.7 cm. Additional
prominent
retrocrural nodes are noted measuring up to 13mm.

The noncontrast appearance of the liver, spleen, adrenals,
pancreas, and
gallbladder is unremarkable. Within the right kidney, two
hypodense rounded
lesions are seen, the larger of which measured 3.2 x 2.9 cm.
These may
represent simple cysts but are incompletely characterized on
this noncontrast
evaluation. There are punctate calcifications within the lower
pole of the
left kidney which could represent nonobstructing stones. There
is no
hydronephrosis seen within either kidney.

The abdominal loops of small and large bowel are grossly
unremarkable on this
noncontrast study. There is no free air. There is no free fluid.

There is extensive bulky retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy, most
prominent along
the left aortic chain extending into the lef
