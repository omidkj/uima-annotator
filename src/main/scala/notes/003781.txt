PERTINENT IMAGING:
pCXR [**2164-6-29**] FINDINGS:  Unchanged mild fluid overload.
Unchanged moderate cardiomegaly.  No larger pleural effusions.
No focal parenchymal opacity suggesting pneumonia.  Retrocardiac
atelectasis is unchanged.

FINDINGS:
The study is suboptimal due to patient's body habitus.  Color
flow is seen within the left common femoral vein with
appropriate waveforms.  Flow can also be detectted within the
left popliteal vein.  The remaining left lower extremity veins
could not be imaged with ultrasound due to patient's body
habitus.
IMPRESSION:
Non-diagnostic study due to patient's body habitus.
