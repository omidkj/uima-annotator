Chief Complaint:
Mechanical fall


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
85F on Coumadin for afib who is s/p mechanical fall down 2
stairs with positive LOC. She struck the left side of her head
and vomited once following striking her head. She initially was

IMAGING / STUDIES:
# CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST ([**2158-6-11**] at 9:03 AM):
There is a 6 x 5 mm hyperattenuating focus involving the left
frontal lobe (2:23), compatible with left intraparenchymal
hemorrhage. No new area of acute intracranial hemorrhage is
identified. There is no loss of [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter
differentiation or cerebral edema to suggest acute ischemic
event. Confluent hypodensities primarily in periventricular
distribution of both cerebral hemispheres are most compatible
with chronic, small vessel ischemic disease. Sulci and
ventricles are prominent, likely age-related involutional
changes. There is no shift of normal midline structures. There
is no hydrocephalus. Axial calcifications involving the
vertebral and coronary arteries are noted. Visualized soft
tissues and osseous structures are unremarkable. Mild mucosal
thickening of maxillary sinuses is noted. Mastoid air cells
appear under-pneumatized, which may be congenital or
alternatively, sequelae of chronic prior infections.
IMPRESSION:
1. A 5 x 6 mm hyperattenuating focus involving the left frontal
region, compatible with intraparenchymal hemorrhage.
Alternatively, this lesion may represent a vascular
malformation, cavernoma or hypercellular neoplasm. There is no
additional imaging available for comparison. No additional area
of acute intracranial hemorrhage or hydrocephalus.
2. Confluent hypodensities in periventricular distribution, most
likely small vessel ischemic disease.
3. Prominent sulci and ventricles, likely age-related
involutionary changes.
.
# CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST ([**2158-6-13**] at 1:29 PM):
A subcentimeter focus of hyperdensity in the left frontal lobe
measures 4 x 4 mm, not definitely changed since two days ago.
There is no clear surrounding edema. There is a new small right
subdural collection, slightly denser than CSF. There is no shift
of normally midline structures, or evidence of major vascular
territorial acute infarction. There is unnchanged appearance of
periventricular white matter hypodensity indicative of
microangiopathic ischemic disease. The visualized paranasal
sinuses and soft tissues appear unremarkable.
IMPRESSION:
1. Unchanged subcentimeter hyperdense focus in the left frontal
lobe, without interim development of surrounding edema. This
raises the possibility of a cavernous malformation, rather than
a hemorrhagic contusion. Continued follow-up is recommended. MRI
could help assess for a cavernous malformation, if not
contraindicated.
2. New small right subdural collection, only minimally denser
than CSF. Its low density and new appearance since two days
earlier suggests the possibility of a hygroma (and raises the
question of a dural tear), rather than a subdural hematoma.
.
# TTE (Complete) ([**2158-6-14**] at 1:55:11 PM):
The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Overall left ventricular systolic functi
