Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 832**]
Chief Complaint:
shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
The patient is an 87 year old male with a history of COPD,
recent pneumonia, and recent admission s/p fall with complex
tibial plateau and non-displaced fibular head fractures.  He was
recently admitted to [**Hospital6 5016**] from [**2161-2-24**] to [**2161-3-4**]
for COPD exacerbation and pneumonia.  Several days after
discharge, he fell and sustained complex tibial plateau and
non-displaced fibular head fractures.  He was admitted to [**Hospital 28941**] and then transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] due to his comorbidities and
concern about whether he would be a good surgical candidate.  He
was admitted at [**Hospital1 18**] from [**2161-3-12**] to [**2161-3-14**] and evaluated by
Orthopedics, with a decision made to pursue nonsurgical
management with [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] hinge knee brace and rehabilitation.
Enoxaparin was continued during his stay and at discharge.  He
had a followup appointment with Orthopedics today.
.
After his Orthopedics appointment, he developed acute shortness
of breath while waiting for his ride back to rehab, which he
attributed to his oxygen tank running out.  Prior to his recent
pneumonia admission, he had not been on home oxygen, nebulizers,
or systemic steroids.  His SpO2 was initially reported in the
80s, but there was difficulty getting good pulse oximetry
readings.  He remained alert and conversant, and was sent to the
ED by EMS.
.
In the ED, initial VS were T 96.6, BP 105/61, HR 110, RR 32,
SpO2 100% on NRB.  His labs were notable for WBC 14.0, Hct 31.0,
Na 130, and K 7.0 (hemolyzed).  He had Troponin elevation to
0.10 (<0.01 on [**2161-3-12**]) and proBNP 1188.  UA and coags were
unremarkable.  His initial lactate in the ED was 5.2, decreasing
to 4.2 one hour later.  His CXR was grossly unremarkable with no
definite acute pulmonary process.  He became hypotensive to
79/58 and was given 3 L NS, with improvement in his pressure to
105/71 and UO 400 ml.  He was given Cefepime 2 grams IV,
Levofloxacin 500 mg IV, and Vancomycin 1 gram IV.  Subsequent
CTA showed bilateral lobar and segmental pulmonary emboli, right
lower lobe consolidation, and enlarged right heart likely due to
right heart strain.  He was placed on a Heparin drip and NRB.
His lactate decreased to 2.0 prior to reaching the ICU.  Vital
signs on transfer to the ICU were HR 96, BP 100/57, RR 24, and
SpO2 98% on NRB.
.
On reaching the ICU, the patient reported mild SOB improved from
earlier in the day and a chronic cough, also improved.  He
reported having looser stools than usual at rehab, but had been
started on stool softeners, and mild periumbilical tenderness in
his abdomen.  He was generally comfortable but tired.  He denied
any pain in his leg at the fracture site or in his calves.

Blood culture [**2161-3-27**]: No growth to date.
Urine culture [**2161-3-28**]: No growth.
Sputum culture [**2161-3-29**]: Respiratory flora.
.
EKG Sinus tachycardia with ventricular premature beats and
atrial premature beats. Right bundle-branch block. Compared to
the previous tracing of [**2161-3-12**] right bundle-branch block and
ventricular premature beats are seen on the current tracing.
.
Knee x-ray: 1. Comminuted tibial plateau fractures in unchanged
alignment with approximately 11 mm of depression of the lateral
tibial plateau articular surface. 2. Nondisplaced proximal
fibular fracture.
.
CXR: Limited study, but otherwise grossly unremarkable with no
definite acute pulmonary process.
.
CTA: 1. Bilateral lobar and segmental pulmonary emboli. 2. Right
lower lobe consolidation might represent infarct or less likely
pneumonia/aspiration. 3. Enlarged right heart likely due to
right heart strain. Correlate with echocardiogram.
.
TTE: Suboptimal image quality. The left atrium is mildly
dilated. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. Due to suboptimal technical
quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully
excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic function is probably
normal (LVEF 50-60%). There is no ventricular septal defect. RV
systolic function appears mildly depressed (RV not well seen).
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is
not present. No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic
valve. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary artery
systolic pressure could not be determined. There is no
pericardial effusion.
.
CXR: New right pleural effusion and right lower lobe opacity,
which may represent atelectasis, but aspiration or pneumonia
cannot be excluded.
