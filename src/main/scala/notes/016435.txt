Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4765**]
Chief Complaint:
weakness, back pain


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 20113**] is an 87 year old Russian-speaking man with a PMH
significant for CAD s/p inferior non-Q wave MI, s/p CVA in [**2171**]
with right eye vision loss, DMII, hyperlipidemia, & HTN who
presents as a transfer from [**Hospital6 **] with 1 day
h/o weakness, shortness of breath, and low-grade fever. Via an
interpreter, the patient and his family recount that one day
prior to admission, the patient was feeling "weak" with
"numbness" in his feet and hands. He had little appetite and did
not eat or drink much. Early on the day of admission, the
patient was walking to the bathroom with the aid of his walker
and felt weak and was unable to support himself so he "slid" to
the floor. He denies loss of consciousness or injury to his
head. He called for his wife, but he does not remember any
events after this until he was in the ambulance on the way to
the hospital. His wife reports that when she found her husband
on the floor, he was awake and alert, but she was unable to lift
him, so she called her son, who came over. He was concerned as
he stated that his father did not look "all there" even though
he was awake, so he called the ambulance. At the OSH, the
patient was hypoglycemic with a FSG of 40 that resolved with
D50. Cardiac enzymes were drawn, demonstrating a troponin of
9.08 with an unconcerning EKG. He received ASA and Plavix before
being transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**]. In the emergency room at [**Hospital1 18**],
the patient denied chest pain, but was tachypneic to 25-30 and
appeared diaphoretic and felt warm. Initial vitals were:T 100.6
HR 85, BP 148/61, RR 25, O2 Sat 100% on 4L. In addition to the
ASA & Plavix, he was then placed on a heparin gtt and given
Tylenol for his fever.

Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema,
palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 20113**] is an 87 year old Russian-speaking man with a PMH
significant for CAD s/p inferior non-Q wave MI, s/p CVA in [**2171**]
with right eye vision loss, DMII, hyperlipidemia, & HTN who
presents as a transfer from [**Hospital6 **] with 1 day
h/o weakness, shortness of breath, and low-grade fever.
.
# Shortness of breath/weakness/low-grade fever: Patient with 1
day of shortness of breath and weakness/numbness in his feet and
hands leading to 2 mechanical falls at home in the past 24
hours. Patient reports little appetite, poor PO's x 2 days. No
other localizing symptoms. On admission to the [**Hospital1 18**], FSG was
40. Normal Gap,  lactate, WBC. Patient did have low grade fever
intermittently that resolved with Tylenol. No consolidation on
CXR. Blood and urine culture were negative. This may represent
viral infection causing low grade fever, poor PO's and shortness
of breath.  Furthermore, given his CXR finding of hyperinflation
and smoking history, it is likely that patient has COPD that
hasn't been diagnosed.  Patient has no PFT in our system, and
has never seen a pulmonologist.  Patient was given standing
albuterol and ipratropium nebs during this hospital stay.  Also,
given the history of "shortness of breath leading to feeling of
impending doom" that finally came out when Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 171**] talked to
the patie
