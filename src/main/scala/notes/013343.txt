Service: CARDIOTHORACIC

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 922**]
Chief Complaint:
chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
AVR/ CABG x 3/ removal thyroid goiter [**2124-6-1**] (LIMA to LAD, SVG
to OM, SVG to PDA, 27 mm CE pericardial valve)


History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 73M w/ h/o MIx2, critical aortic stenosis, HTN,
CRI, h/o TIAs who presents with several weeks of chest
burning/discomfort. His aortic stenosis was diagnosed 5-6 years
ago and has been followed by serial TTEs by his cardiologist Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **]. He has been having several weeks of chest pain that he
describes as a burning sensation across his entire chest and
radiating down both arms. It does not radiate to the neck. He
specifically denies a feeling of pressure. He does not have
presyncopal symptoms or syncopal episodes. These symptoms happen
almost exclusively with exertion. He reports one episde over the
weekend where he felt some discomfort sitting on his bed, and he
took 2 SL NTG with some relief. He reports some DOE but it has
been ongoing for several years. He went to [**Hospital 1474**] Hospital
about 2 weeks ago for these symptoms and was diagnosed with
bronchitis. He saw Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] last week who told him his
symptoms were due to his AS and that he would have to have his
surgery soon. He was told this could not wait until he went back
to [**State 108**] in four months. Because his symptoms have not gotten
any better, his wife drove him to the [**Name (NI) **] today.

Past Medical History:

Social History:
 Lives with his wife in [**Name (NI) 108**] for 8 months of the year and in
[**Location (un) 86**] [**Month (only) **] through [**Month (only) **]. He has eight children, 6 from a

Pertinent Results:
Cardiac cath:
1. Selective coronary angiography demonstrated three vessel
coronary artery disease in a right dominant circulation. The
LMCA had mild diffuse disease. The LAD had a proximal focal 70%
stenosis immediately after the D1 branch. The LCX had an origin
70% stenosis. The remainder of the LCX and OM branches were
without flow limiting disease. The RCA had a mid 80% stenosis.
2. Resting hemodynamics from right and left heart
catheterization reveal elevated right sided filling pressures
RVEDP=11mmHg and normal left sided filling pressures
LVEDP=11mmHg and mean PCWP=11mmHg. Cardiac output and index were
4.5 L/min and 2.2 L/min/m2 respectively.
3. Severe aortic stenois was present with peak-to-peak gradient
of 55mmHg and mean gradient of 44 mmHg. [**Location (un) 109**] was 0.75 cm2.
4. Left ventriculogram not performed due to elevated creatinine.

CT Scan Date:[**2124-6-6**]

1. Small bilateral pleural effusions layer posteriorly.
Questioned right
upper pleural or extrapleural loculation is right upper lobe
collapse,
probably related to retained secretions.

2. Essentially normal postoperative appearance following median
sternotomy,
aortic valve replacement, CABG, and thyroidectomy.

[**2124-6-2**] ECHO
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There
are complex(mobile) atheroma in the descending aorta. A
bioprosthetic aortic valve prosthesis is present. The aortic
prosthesis appears well seated, with normal leaflet/disc motion
and transvalvular gradients. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. There is
no pericardial effusion. Transgastric mid-papillary view shows
evidence of hypovolemia. All the four pulmonary veins were
visualized with no increase in velocities.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 29571**] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2124-5-24**] for further
evaluation of his chest discomfort. An echocardiogram was
performed which revealed severe aortic stenosis with an aortic
valve area of 0.5cm2. A cardiac catheterization was performed
which revealed severe three vessel disease in addition to the
known severe aortic stenosis. As he had a large hematoma and a
new femoral bruit post catheterization, a femoral ultrasound was
obtained which showed no evidence of pseudoaneurysm or AV
fistula. Given the severity of his disease, the cardiac surgery
service was consulted for surgical management. Mr. [**Known lastname 29571**] was
worked-up in the usual preoperative manner including a carotid
duplex ultrasound which revealed moderate plaque on the right
with a 40-59% carotid stenosis and the left had less than a 40%
stenosis status post endarterectomy. Mr. [**Known lastname 46217**]
preoperative chest x-ray revealed a fullness which was likely a
goiter. A CT scan was performed which showed a multinodular
goiter, a trachea which was narrowed to two thirds of its normal
diameter at the level of the thyroid, moderate-to-severe
emphysema, small hiatal hernia and a probable liver cyst which
incompletely assessed. The enodocrinology service was consulted
who recommended a thyroidectomy given that he was hyperthyroid,
there was tracheal compression and the elevated risk of cancer.
Given the finding of his goiter, the thoracic surgery service
was consulted for assistance in his care. It was decided that a
concommittant thyroidectomy would be peformed with his cardiac
surgery. As Mr. [**Known lastname 29571**] had some renal failure post
catheterization, the renal service was consulted and a renal
ultrasound was performed. This showed multiple right renal cysts
and a nonobstructing kidney stone on the left. Slowly his
creatine normalized. As Mr. [**Known lastname 29571**] had a history of heavy
smoking and chronic obstuctive pulmonary disease, the pulmonary
service was consulted. Atrovent and albuterol were prescribed
and pulmonary function testing was planned. On [**2124-6-1**], Mr.
[**Known lastname 29571**] was taken to the operating room where he underwent
coronary artery bypass grafting to three [**Last Name (LF) 56207**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] aortic
valve replacement using a 27mm pericardial valve and a total
thyroidectomy. Postoperatively he was taken to the cardiac
intensive care unit for monitoring. Synthroid and calcium
supplementation was started. He under
