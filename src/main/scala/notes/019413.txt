History of Present Illness:
70 year old woman with a history of hypertension, stage III CKD,
and COPD who was admitted [**2119-7-2**] with nausea and vomiting and
found to have NSTEMI and hypoxia requiring admission to the CCU.
.
She reports acute onset of nausea/vomiting and dry heaving this
morning. Vomitus was non-bloody, yellow in color. Also
assocaited with diarreha, 4  movements in last 24 hours. She
reported subjective fevers and chill but no abdominal cramping
or pain. She denies sick contacts or unusual foods. Of note,
patient was recently seen in the ED for bloody diarrhea and
upper respiratory symptoms. She was diagnosed with infectious
colitis and was given moxifloxacin and metronidazole. Also a
recent admission to [**Hospital1 18**] for acute on chronic kidney injury
(1.5 to 3.4).
.
In the ED, initial vitals were 98.1, 141/99, 112, 22, 100%RA.
Exam significant for ill-appearing female that was dry heaving
multiple times, hemoccult negative. Labs notable for WBC 15.7
(93%N), K 3.0 (repleted) , Phos 2.2, Mg 1.4 (repleted on floor),
lactate 3.2 (repeat 1.9), AG 21. Normal LFTs, lipase, and UA,
utox. KUB and CT ABD showed no acute cardiopulmonary process.
EKG similar to prior. She was given IVF (1 L NS), zofran x 2,
ativan 1 mg IV x 1, 40 meQ KCL in 1L D%4, Reglan 10 mg IV x 1.
She was admitted as unable to tolerate PO, continuing n/v.
.
On arrival to the floor, she as tachycardic and 110 with bursts
to 140 with vomiting. She developed sustained tachycardia to
140-150 and triggered for increasing oxygen requriement to 90%
on 4-5LNC and hypotension on . She was given 500cc bolus IVNS.
She was given metoprolol 5 mg IV x 1 and diltiazem 10 mg IV x 1
without effect. EKG showed sinus tachycardia STD V3-V5. CXR
showed worseing pulmonary edema. STAT labs cardiac biomarkers
returned CK-MB 18 MB 6.3 TropnT 0.90.
.
On arrrival to the CCU, Vitals were 134/57 p77 rr24 97% on 50%
facemask. She reported that her breathing was comfortable,
nausea resolved. Denies chest pain, palpatations, dyspena,
cough,  orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or
presyncope. Repeat EKG showed sinus tachycardia at 103BPM, PR
depressions in II, III, aVF, previously seen STD in V3-V5
resolved.

IMAGING/STUDIES:

CT ABDOMEN/PELVIS [**2119-7-2**]:
IMPRESSION: 1. Radiographic lucency corresponds to colon
interposed between the liver and diaphragm. 2. Fluid-filled
cecum and ascending colon is compatible with history of
diarrhea. Normal appendix. 3. Scattered diverticula without
diverticulitis.

CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW [**2119-7-2**]:
The heart is not enlarged. There is no [**Month/Day/Year 1902**], focal infiltrate, or
effusion.  The right hemidiaphragm is slightly elevated. Minimal
atelectasis at both bases. Linear calcification overlying the
right lung apex likely represents vascular calcification.  Right
upper quadrant surgical clips noted. No free air is seen beneath
the diaphragm. Visualized portion of the bowel shows a
nonspecific gas pattern. IMPRESSION: No acute pulmonary process
identified.

ECG [**2119-7-2**]:
Sinus rhythm with premature atrial contractions. Normal tracing.
Compared to the previous tracing no diagnostic interim change.

ECHOCARDIOGRAM [**2119-7-3**]:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There is mild regional
left ventricular systolic dysfunction with hypokinesis of the
basal inferior, inferolateral and inferoseptal segments. The
remaining segments contract normally (LVEF = 40-45%). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There
is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen; it is likely
ischemic in nature. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could
not be determined. There is no pericardial effusion. IMPRESSION:
Mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction, c/w CAD.
Moderate mitral regurgitation. Compared with the report of the
prior study (images unavailable for review) of [**2112-3-23**],
regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction is new.

ECHOCARDIOGRAM [**2119-7-5**]:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The left atrium is elongated.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction
with hypokinesis of the basal-mid inferior and inferolateral
walls. The remaining segments contract normally (LVEF = 40-45
%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The
tricuspid regurgitation jet is eccentric and may be
underestimated. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion. Compared to the
study dated [**2119-7-3**] (images reviewed), the patient is more
tachycardic. Pulmonary pressures are now in the moderate range
(undetermined on the prior study). Other findings are similar.

SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW OF THE CHEST [**2119-7-8**]:
Comparison is made with prior study performed a day earlier.
Cardiomediastinal contours are normal. Aeration of the right
lung has improved. There are no new lung abnormalities. Right
PICC remains in place. The tip is difficult to visualize, can be
followed at least to the cavoatrial junction. There is no
pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
