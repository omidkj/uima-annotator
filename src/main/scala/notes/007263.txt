History of Present Illness:
32 year old female with a history of asthma presented [**2114-8-31**]
with status asthmaticus. She normally has good symptom control
on advair and albuterol and has been hospitalized for
respiratory distress, but has never been intubated. She
developed a URI 1 week prior to admission, which is the likely
trigger. She went to an OSH initially and was given
ceftriaxone/azithromycin and solumedrol. CTA of the chest was
negative for PE or infiltrate. Her ABG (unclear on how much
oxygen) was slightly acidotic, but showed good oxygenation and
no evidence of CO2 retention. She was transferred here on
continuous nebulizer treatments, received magnesium and
continued solumedrol.

ROS: Neg for chest pain, rash, abd pain, diarrhea. Yesterday had
one episode of post-tussive emesis.

In ED here, received magnesium, continuous neb; currently 94% on
continuous albuterol neb and feeling improved. Complaining of HA
which she has had since last night, gradual onset, hx HA in the
past, has used Fioricet previously.

Microbiology:
Blood cx's: E. faecalis, sensitive to ampicillin
Urine legionella antigen: negative
Surveillence cx's: negative

Imaging Studies:
CXRs from admission:IMPRESSION: Ill-defined density of the right
lower lobe and left retrocardiac region. The latter findings
might represent pneumonia in correct clinical setting.

Subsequent CXRs demonstrate increased and improved aeration of
her lungs.

Head CT:
IMPRESSION: Tiny left frontal subcutaneous hematoma without
underlying
fracture or intracranial hemorrhage.


Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 32 y.o. F with asthma presenting with status asthmaticus,
much improved with room air/ambulatory sats in the 95%. Also
with E. faecalis bacteremia. Called out of MICU on [**9-1**].

#Asthma exacerbation: Patient was initially admitted to the MICU
for monitoring and treatment of her asthma exacerbation. She
received continuous albuterol nebs, as well as additional
magnesium, Atrovent, Advair, and IV Solumedrol. Given her
persistent hypoxia on ICU day 2, Azithromycin was added for
atypical coverage and she completed a 5 day course while in the
hospital.  An arterial line was placed for monitoring. She
clinically improved and oxygen was able to be weaned to room air
(93%), but the patient was sypmtomatically more comfortable on a
35% humidified face tent. She was transferred to the floor on
[**2114-9-2**], and transitioned to oral prednisone. Her ambulatory
saturations improved to 95%. Her peak flows were acceptable per
respiratory. She was continued on a 2 week prednisone taper as
follows: 60 mg x3 days ([**Date range (1) 29491**],completed), 50 mg x3 days
([**Date range (1) 22564**], completed), 40 mg x3 days ([**Date range (1) 29492**]), 30 mg x3 days
([**Date range (1) 8967**]), 20 mg x3 days ([**Date range (1) 29493**]), then off.) She was
tapered off of standing albuterol nebs and discharged on q6H PRN
with a machine at home (SW instrumental in helping her get this
at no cost). She was continued on Advair, Singulair on
discharge. She was attempted on CPAP but did not tolerate the
machine (had panic attack and claustrophobia). She may have a
sleep study to evaluate for OSA as an outpatient. She has
pertussis serology still pending at the time of discharge.

#Bacteremia: Pt had pansensitive E. faecalis from [**8-31**] blood
cultures. Her surveillance cultures negative. She received 10
days of IV ampicillin while in house. Afebrile and
hemodynamically stable on discharge.

#Fall: Pt reports a fall in ICU, and being unsteady on her feet
(not at her baseline, as reports being very active.) She also
had a fall overnight on [**9-6**] after receiving sleeping
medication, and she hit her head and her R knee. Her neurologic
exam and MS exams were stable, and her hematocrit remained
stable at 38. She had a Head CT w/o contrast that showed a
subcutaneous hematoma, but no evidence of intracranial bleed,
midline shift, or structural malformation. She received
Ibuprofen/Tylenol for soft tissue trauma/pain to her frontal
head, R knee. She was kept on fall precautions and was not given
sleeping medication at night thereafter. PT was consulted, and
deemed her safe to go home with physical therapy treatments.

#Anxiety: She takes high doses of valium daily as outpatient,
and was tolerating ativan here. Benzodiazapines were held
initially during her hospitalization, as there was concern on
admission for respitory compromise. While on the floor, her
respirations were stable. She was continued on celexa and a
lower dose of her outpatient valium (TID instead of QID.) Her
outpt psychiatrist has referred her to outpt therapist to deal
w/ multiple psychosocial stressors at home.  SW has provided pt
with resources to help w/ therapist co-pay from MassHealth.

#Hyperglycemia: in setting of acute illness and steroids.
Continued on regular insulin sliding scale while in house.
.
#Back pain: Likely osteoarthritis, muscular pain,
deconditioning. Pt was treated w/ ibuprofen (pre-treated w/
compazine for nausea) and lidocaine patches.
.
#Crohn's Disease: currently with diarrhea--likely antibiotic
associated, given high dose steroids recently. Othe
