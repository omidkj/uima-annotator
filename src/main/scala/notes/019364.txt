Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3984**]
Chief Complaint:
Altered mental status

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
lumbar puncture

History of Present Illness:
77M with CLL, CAD, afib, CRI, DM1 presents with 2 days of
worsening confusion. He is normally completely oriented and
sharp. Over the course of 2 days, his mental status declining
from mistaking the time of day to the point that he was noted to
have 2 sets of clothes on. His family reports that the patient
only c/o fatigue, decreased appetite the week leading up to the
hospitalization. He had no fever, chills, HA, abdominal sxs,
respiratory sxs, sick contacts. [**Name (NI) **] had seen his PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 1023**] took a
CXR that was reportedly clear and recommended CT torso, which
the pt declined. When the pt did not improve, his family brought
him to ED where his vitals were 97.3, 95, 129/61, 19, 96% RA. He
received a CXR, a CT head, and labs which were all unrevealing.
LP was deferred initially due to elevated INR.
On HD#2, the pt underwent LP by the neurology consult service
and was found to have 2375 WBCs which were 99% lymphocytes,
protein of 212, and glucose of 128. Neurology felt this was c/w
meningitis, possibly carcinomatous. He was started on
vanc/ceftriaxone/amp/acyclovir. Oncology was consulted and
reviewed the CSF with Heme path and felt that the CSF was c/w
reactive lymphocytosis, NOT carcinomatous meningitis, (flow
cytometry showed 99% reactive lymphocytosis and 1% CLL cells).
During this hospitalization his mental status has deteriorated
rapidly. Pt's family reported that he walked into the ED and was
able to answer questions appropriately. This gradually
deteriorated to only recognizing his family members on the floor
to keeping his eyes shut, moaning, and grimacing on arrival to
the ICU.

.
CXR [**2130-6-27**]: Significant interval decrease in the moderate right
pleural
effusion. Unchanged right middle and lower lobe atelectasis.
.
Sinus CT [**2130-6-28**]: 1. Chronic sinus disease with opacification
and remodeling of the left sphenoid sinus and posterior ethmoid
air cells, with the appearance of a mucocele in an Onodi cell in
the region of the left orbital apex. 2. Right second bicuspid
([**Doctor First Name **] #4) periapical abscess, with reactive changes in the floor
of that maxillary antrum.
.
Head CT [**2130-6-28**]: 1. No evidence of hemorrhage or vascular
territorial infarction. 2. Global atrophy. 3. Chronic left
sphenoid and ethmoid sinusitis, better evaluated on concurrent
maxillofacial CT.
.
Head MRI [**2130-6-30**]:
1. No enhancing brain parenchymal lesion or acute infarcts
identified.
2. Tiny right frontoparietal subdural hematoma with maximum
width of
approximately 3 mm with pachy-meningeal enhancement, which could
be secondary to the subdural collection or secondary to lumbar
puncture.
3. Subtle leptomeningeal signal at the right frontal convexity
on FLAIR
images without enhancement is as a non-specific finding and
could be due to vascular enhancement or an early sign of
leptomeningeal disease.
4. Mild-to-moderate changes of small vessel disease.
5. Soft tissue changes due to inspissated secretions in the left
posterior
ethmoid air cells and left sphenoid sinus, which could be
secondary to
obstructive sinusitis.

Brief Hospital Course:
77-year-old man with a with history of CLL, atrial fibrillation,
type 1 diabetes mellitus presented with 2 days of worsening
confusion and disorientation.
.
# Acute mental status changes: Lumbar puncture, neuroimaging
studies, metabolic work-up, extensive infectious disease work-up
revealed no apparent etiology for his altered mental status.
Infectious Diseases, Hematology-Oncology, Neurology were
consulted. He was empirically treated with broad-spectrum
antimicrobials as well as IVIG for hypogammaglobulinemia.
However, his clinical status continued to deteriorate, and the
family decided to changed his code status to DNR/DNI and comfort
measures only. The patient expired on [**2130-7-6**].
