Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1928**]
Chief Complaint:
Back pain.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
This is a 69 yo man with a h/o multiple myeloma who was referred
from HD [**8-5**] with increasing back pain. He was discharged [**8-4**]
from [**Hospital1 18**] with pain well controlled but at rehab they did not
give him any dilaudid. Reportedly he was very histronic at rehab
so they referred him in. He denies any change in the pain and no
additional symptoms. He notes the pain is 0/10 after morphine in
the ED and is requesting it by name vs. dilaudid that he was
discharged on. He is also hungry but those are his only
complaints. Of note documents from [**Location (un) 582**] note dilaudid given
at least once on [**8-4**] and [**8-5**].
In the ED, initial vs were: T 99.5 HR 98 BP: 199/92 RR: 16 Sat:
95%. Initially he was given dilaudid 1mg iv which he did not
think worked, and then was given morphine SR 15mg po then 4mg iv
morphine which helped.
ROS: All other review of systems negative except as noted above.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 69629**] is a 69 y.o. man with multiple myeloma and ESRD on
[**Known lastname 2286**] who presented with poor pain control. His
hospitalization was complicated by aspiration PNA which
necessitated transfer to the ICU. His hospitalization was
complicated by delirium.

Delirium: Multifactorial: end-stage myeloma, hypercalcemia,
pain, ICU stay, and pain meds. He had been was alert to person
and place prior to ICU transfer.   He had a waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**]
mental status, that gradually cleared through his
hospitalization.  A primary contributor to his mental status was
his elevated calcium, and with treatment of his calcium with
pamidronate and IV steroids, his mental status improved, and he
is now alert and oriented. The likelihood that he will again
become altered was discussed with the family.  Currently his
calcium levels have been monitored daily and if they continue to
rise, can be treated with IV pamidronate, which he has received
in the past.  On the day of discharge he is A&O x 3, alert and
conversant with a Spanish translator.

Pain control: The patient entered the ICU with poorly controlled
pain resulting from his metastatic multiple myeloma. The pain
consult team evaluated the patient and recommended a regimen.
This included a Fentanyl patch 50 mcg/hr, lidocaine 5% patch 2
patches, Dilaudid 2 mg PO q3 hr PRN and Acetaminophen 650 mg [**Hospital1 **]
ATC. He was then restarted on PO celebrex 100mg [**Hospital1 **].  His pain
currently has improved and is now on a stablized regimen.

Aspiration pneumonia: While in the ICU, the patient developed an
oxygen requirement. Currently on vanco (started [**8-11**]), cefepime
(started [**8-8**]) and flagyl (started [**8-8**]). Has not been febrile.
Antibiotics were discontinued after 5 days.   He again developed
an oxygen requirement after several weeks into his
hospitalization.  Chest CT revealed a dense RUL pneumonia.
Repeat cultures are negative.  Repeat Chest imagine on [**8-28**] shows
progression of consolidation and the patient was empirically
started on Zosyn 2.25mg IV BID and on the day of discharge is on
d3/10.  Repeat imaging could be considered after his course is
completed.  His respiratory status is stable on 2L O2 by nasal
cannula.

Positive AFB:  He was found to have AFB on his sputum culture
from [**7-21**] during his prior hospitalization.  He was placed on
respiratory precautions and the ID service was consulted.  The
DNA proble from the state returned postive for MAC and negative
of MTb.  The possibility of treatment for MAC was considered and
the discussion occurred between the ID service and his
outpatient oncologist, who felt that it was not appropriate at
this time to treat the MAC infection.  His respiratory isolation
was discontinued.  Addtionally, one more induced sputum was
obtained and the ID team felt that further specimens should be
obtained if treatment would be considered.  Furthermore, the ID
team also discussed the option of repeat bronchoscopy with
biopsy, but per the pulmonary service, the pt would need
intubation to perform the bronchoscopy.  After discussion with
the pt's son, the decision was to avoid intubation and
bronchoscopy at that time given the risks/benefits of the
procedure.

Atrial fibrillation: The patient had episodes of atrial
fibrillation with RVR while in the unit. He was in NSR for
approximately 2 weeks, but then went back in to AF on [**2130-8-24**].
Chest CT revealed no PE but the pneumonia described above.  His
metoprolol was titrated up to 100mg TID.  He is not
anticoagulated due to prior discussions regarding risk/benefit
analysis with his family.  On discharge, he remained in NSR at
the above dose.

Hypercalcemia: The patient has been receiving daily [**Date Range 13241**]
due to hypercalcemia. IV steroids and Pamidronate were
initiated.  His calcium improved with these treatments.  The
level was starting to rise again by [**8-24**], and he will need
repeat dosing of pamidronate, possibly as frequently as every 2
weeks.  But, pamidronate should be administered when his calcium
level continues to rise.

Multiple myeloma: The patient has been followed by oncology.
Several family meetings were held to discuss the goals of care.
The patient's HCP, [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) **]., has continued to ask for other
options for his father's care. As Mr. [**Known lastname 69629**] [**Last Name (Titles) 48752**] an
improved mental status, he again started to request further
chemotherapy.  A meeting was held with the pt's primary
oncologist, his wife, and son who discussed that no further
chemotherapeutic options were appropriate now
