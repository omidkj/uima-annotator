CHIEF COMPLAINT:   Cardiac arrest.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 69 year old
male with a history of coronary artery disease status post
remote myocardial infarction, hypertension,
hypercholesterolemia, and chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease who presented status post witnessed arrest at home in
the presence of his wife.  The patient was reported to have
fallen backwards without prodrome or complaint, hitting the
floor near his bed.  EMS was contact[**Name (NI) **] and arrived upon the
scene within five minutes.  The patient was found to be
pulseless and apneic.

CPR was started, the patient was intubated and pads were
placed revealing ventricular fibrillation.  The patient was
defibrillated at 200, 300 and 300, with no response.  He was
given 1 mg of epinephrine which converted him to systole,
then given Atropine times two and Epinephrine times three,
which converted him to PEA, which transitioned to an
idioventricular rhythm at 20 beats per minute.  The patient
had pacing attempted without success.  He reverted to
asystole.

He was given an ampule of bicarbonate and epinephrine which
converted the patient to ventricular fibrillation.  He was
defibrillated at 03:16, given 300 mg of Amiodarone.  He was
transferred to [**Hospital3 417**] and then transferred to [**Hospital1 1444**].

His EKG showed inferoposterior injury changes.  He arrived on
Dobutamine, Neo-Synephrine and Amiodarone.  Cardiac
catheterization revealed diffuse three-vessel disease.  He
has elevated left filling pressures.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
2.  Coronary artery disease status post remote myocardial
infarction.
3.  Hypercholesterolemia.
4.  Hypertension.

ALLERGIES:   No known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS:
1.  Atenolol.
2.  Lipitor.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives with his wife.  [**Name (NI) **] has a
positive smoking history.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Noncontributory.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient's pulse was 83; blood
pressure 123/60; respiratory rate of 14 and oxygen saturation
of 98%, on mechanical ventilation of AC-800 by 14;
respiratory rate of 15.  He was on 100% FIO2.  On general
examination, the patient was an ill appearing intubated man
in no apparent distress.  HEENT examination reveals scleral
edema and moist mucous membranes.  Neck examination revealed
no lymphadenopathy.  Cardiac examination revealed a regular
rate and rhythm, normal S1 and S2 that were distant and no
murmurs, rubs or gallops.  Pulmonary examination revealed
diffuse inspiratory and expiratory wheezes.  Abdominal
examination revealed a belly that was soft, moderately
distended, nontender, with no bowel sounds appreciated.
Extremities revealed trace edema and no dorsalis pedis
pulses.

LABORATORY:  Pertinent laboratory findings were the patient's
white count of 8.0 with a hematocrit of 36.5 and platelets of
188.  The patient's creatinine was 1.5.  His CK was 138 with
an MB of 28.7, a troponin of 1.98.

Initial arterial blood gas was 7.19 with pCO2 of 37 and pAO2
of 301.

EKG revealed normal sinus rhythm, normal axis and massive ST
elevations in II, III and AVF with reciprocal changes in I
and L.  The patient also had early transition and massive ST
depressions in V2 through V5.  These findings were consistent
with an inferoposterior myocardial infarction.

Cardiac catheterization revealed diffusely diseased three
vessel coronary system.  The mid-left circumflex was totally
occluded as was the mid right coronary artery.  The left
anterior descending was diffusely diseased.  The patient had
two stents, one to the ostium and one to the mid-portion of
the right coronary artery.  Pulmonary capillary wedge was 40.

SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  This 69 year old man with a
history of coronary artery disease status post remote
myocardial infarction, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia as
well as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, presented with
witnessed cardiac arrest and large inferoposterior myocardial
infarction.

1.  Cardiovascular:  The patient presented with ventricular
fibrillation arrest at home with prolonged resuscitation in
the setting of an inferoposterior myocardial infarction.  He
had total occlusions of the mid right coronary artery and mid
circumflex with a diffusely diseased left anterior
descending.  He received stents times two to his mid right
coronary artery.  He was transferred from the Catheterization
Laboratory on Dopamine and an intra-aortic balloon pump.  The
patient had no palpable pulses in his lower extremities, and
the move was made to remove the intra-aortic balloon pump.

The patient had a worsening lactic acidosis throughout the
morning of admission.  He remained in normal sinus rhythm on
Amiodarone and Lidocaine drips.  He required mechanical
ventilation for control of his acid-based status as well as
for airway protection.  Increasing respiratory rate and total
volumes were not able to control the patient's overwhelming
acidosis.

The patient was markedly oliguric and volume control was not
able to be obtained.  The patient had a markedly distended
abdomen and there was concern for ischemic bowel.  A KUB
showed wall thickening and no free air.  The intra-aortic
balloon pump was removed and the patient continued to have a
worsening acidosis.

After discussion with the family, the decision was made to
abandon aggressive efforts.

The patient experienced at 06:55 p.m. on [**2102-4-23**].

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:   Deceased.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Ventricular fibrillation arrest.
2.  Inferoposterior myocardial infarction.
3.  Coronary artery disease.
4.  Hypercholesterolemia.
5.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
6.  Hypertension.
7.  Overwhelming lactic acidosis.
8.  Acute renal failure.
