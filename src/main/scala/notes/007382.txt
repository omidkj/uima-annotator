Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1257**]
Chief Complaint:
necrotic toes

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Right lower extremity angiography with percutaneous angioplasty
of right peroneal artery x2

History of Present Illness:
The patient is an 82 yo M with ESRD (HD M,W,F), HTN, AFib, PVD,
Hyperlipidemia and CAD s/p ACS and recent stenting presents to
vascular clinic c/o "necrotic toes".  He was seen as an
inpatient about a month ago and found to have ischemic
toes on both feet.  At that time he had cardiac/medical issues
which were treated first.  He presented from rehab today with
complaints of drainage from a necrotic toe on the right foot. He
says that over the past week he has had a lot more pain in his
feet and walking has become more difficult. He denies any
fevers, chills, chest pain, sob. Of note, he was recently

was 8.4 .

FOOT FILMS [**12-17**]
IMPRESSION: No radiographic evidence of osteomyelitis.

PRE-OP CXR [**12-17**]
IMPRESSION: Slight interstitial pulmonary edema with
cardiomegaly. No
superimposed acute process.

CT SINUS/MANDIBLE [**12-18**]
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence for facial or orbital fracture.
2. Severe degenerative disease involving both temporomandibular
joints and the included upper cervical spine.
3. Chronic inflammatory sinus disease.

CT HEAD [**12-18**]
IMPRESSION: No evidence for intracranial hemorrhage.
Wedge-shaped
hypodensities in the left cerebellum, suggestive or prior
infarcts.

ART EXT [**12-24**]
IMPRESSION: Evidence of bilateral tibial disease at rest, which
appears
similar in comparison to the prior examination from one month
ago.

PATHOLOGY LEFT 2ND/4TH TOES [**12-25**]
Left 2nd and 4th toes and right 3rd and 4th toes (A-H):
1.  Gangrene, all toes.
2.  Atheroemboli are seen in multiple vessels.

CARDIAC CATH REPORT [**12-27**]
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Two vessel coronary artery disease, with a known totally
occluded RCA
and patent OM stent.

CXR [**2159-12-29**]
There is again seen a hazy opacity within the lung bases
bilaterally which are
stable and may represent early infiltrate. Aspiration is also a
consideration. There is unchanged cardiomegaly and calcification
and
tortuosity of thoracic aorta. There is some mild prominence of
the pulmonary inteRstitial markings. The right-sided central
venous catheter has the lead tip in the distal SVC, stable.

CHANGE OF G-GJ TUBE
IMPRESSION: Successful exchange of a percutaneous endoscopically
placed
gastrostomy tube for an 18 French MIC gastrojejunostomy tube.
The tube is
ready for use.

CHEST XRAY [**2159-12-31**]
There is no change in the cardiomediastinal silhouette
appearance including
cardiomegaly and tortuous and most likely dilated aortic arch.
Lungs are
unchanged in appearance including left retrocardiac atelectasis
and to a
lesser degree right retrocardiac atelectasis. There is no
interval
development of pneumothorax. No appreciable pleural effusion is
noted,
although a small amount of fluid cannot be excluded. PEG is
projecting over
the upper abdomen. If the bibasilar atelectasis reflects
aspiration, there
has been no significant change since the prior study, thus
aspiration
pneumonia should be considered.


Brief Hospital Course:
Dr [**Known lastname **] is an 82 M with PVD, CKD on HD MWF, progressive
dementia, who was admitted to the vascular surgery service for
evaluation and treatment of his bilateral toe gangrene.  He was
transferred to the Medicine service for continued management of
his aspiration PNA, A-fib with RVR, and CVA found on CT imaging.

#Gangrene of toes:  Dr. [**Known lastname **] was initially admitted with
gangrenous toes and was admitted to the vascular service for
evaluation and treatment of his bilateral toe gangrene.  He
underwent right lower extremity angiography, which showed
single-vessel run-off into the lower leg through his peroneal
artery, which was angioplastied in 2 places.  He later underwent
left lower extremity angiography, which also showed
single-vessel run-off and a long segment of the peroneal artery
was angioplastied and stented.  He was taken to the OR on [**12-25**]
for amputations of his right 3rd and 4th toes, and his left 3rd
and 5th toes.  He was then transferred to the Medicine service
for further management of his MMP.  The vascular service
continued to follow the patient while he was under the care of
the Medicine service both on the floor and in the ICU and
recommended eventual amputation when the patient is more stable
(as he was noted to have a necrotic great toe on the right foot
c/w dry gangrene).  As such, he was discharged with outpatient
follow up appointments with the Vascular service for further
work up.  The pt will need to have dry dressing changes
continued as per vascular recs.
.
# Respiratory/PNA/Excess Secretions:  Dr.[**Name (NI) 93718**] breathing was
labored on admission, with evidence of fluid overload on his
CXR.  He has COPD and was using accessory muscles for breathing,
though his family reports this is his baseline.  His oxygen
requirement increased over a few days, and he began having a wet
[**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] a CXR was obtained on [**12-26**] which showed a likely
aspiration pneumonia.  Pt was started on vanc/cipro/flagyl by
Vascular Surgery with white count and CXR indicative of possible
PNA.  Febrile to 100.4 two days prior to transfer to medicine.
The medicine team continued same abx and changed to vanc/zosyn
on day of transfer to MICU (on [**2159-12-29**]).  Of note, became acutely
tachypneic on morning of [**2159-12-29**]. While volume overload was
certainly possible given the 2 units of pRBCs received o/n (see
below under anemia), it was thought more likely [**1-30**] mucus
plugging as the RN noted increased suction requirement Q15
minutes.  As such, a repeat CXR was done and an ABG showed that
the pt did seem to be retaining CO2.  Due to increased RN needs
and respiratory decompensation, pt was transferred to MICU-7. In
the MICU, over 300mL of TFs were suctione
