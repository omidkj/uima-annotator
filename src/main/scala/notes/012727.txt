Service:  Surgery.

CHIEF COMPLAINT:   Discharge from surgical wound.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient was hospitalized
from [**2102-12-6**] until [**2102-12-11**].  She underwent at that time
bilateral distal external iliac and common femoral artery
endarterectomies with patch angioplasties.  She tolerated the
procedure well.  Her hospital course was unremarkable except
for a draining lymphocele.  The patient was without
constitutional symptoms.  The wound was without erythema.
She was discharged in stable condition with [**Hospital6 1587**] to follow-up with wound care.  She was followed
up a week from post discharge and the skin clips were
removed.  There was no incident of infection present at that
time.  She now presents to our Emergency Room with increasing
drainage from her left groin wound.

The patient noted bleeding from the groin wound the day that
she was seen in the Emergency Room.  The patient is now
admitted for further evaluation and treatment.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Significant for diabetes mellitus.
2.  Hypertension.
3.  Tobacco use.
4.  She does admit to claudication prior to surgery earlier
    this month.

PREVIOUS SURGICAL HISTORY:
1.  Cholecystectomy.
2.  Tonsillectomy.
3.  The patient has known renal artery stenosis on the right
    of 80% and is followed by her primary care physician at
    home.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Physical examination in the Emergency
Room:  Vital signs 99.6 F.; blood pressure 168/95; pulse 68;
respiratory rate 18.  General appearance is an obese elderly
white female sitting in bed.  Her HEENT examination was
unremarkable.  There is no lymphadenopathy.  Chest is clear
to auscultation bilaterally.  She has a regular rate and
rhythm with a III/VI systolic ejection murmur at the left
lower sternal border which radiates to the aorta.  The
abdomen is obese with multiple areas of ecchymosis and is
nontender.  There is no flank tenderness.  There is no spinal
tenderness.  Both lower extremities were with edema, pitting
up to the knee.  The calves are tense with mild tenderness on
palpation.  The left thigh is tender on palpation.  The left
incision in the groin is dehisced and draining.  Neurological
examination was unremarkable.

LABORATORY:  Admitting labs included a CBC with a white blood
cell count of 8,900, hematocrit of 32.5, platelets 243,000,
BUN 17, creatinine 0.9, potassium 4.1, PT and INR were
normal.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient, on admission, was urgently
taken to the Operating Room on [**2102-12-22**], and underwent a
left groin exploration with a left external iliac to SFA
bypass graft with 8 mm ringed [**Doctor Last Name 4726**]-Tex.  The left common
iliac was ligated and the wound was debrided with removal of
the patch.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and was
transferred to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit for continued
monitoring and care.

The patient was afebrile and hemodynamically stable.  She
lost about 1600 cc of blood.  The patient was transfused.
Incisions were clean, dry and intact.  She had a palpable
dorsalis pedis and bilaterally.  She was continued NPO;
intravenous fluids were continued.

Infectious Disease was consulted regarding antibiotic choice
and length of therapy.  Ultrasound showed a low attenuation
and fluid collection seen in both groins, but bilaterally
these were about 7.2 cm on the right and 6 cm on the left.
There was no flow seen in either of these collections.  They
recommended Zosyn and Vancomycin at this time until cultures
showed definitive organisms.  Her white count was elevated on
postoperative day two to 18,100 from 13,100.  Hematocrit
remained stable at 28.8.  Her coagulation studies remained
normal.  Incisions showed a serous drainage and the left
groin was with serous foul smelling drainage.

On postoperative day three, the patient remained afebrile.
White count defervesced to 11,400.  Hematocrit was 26.2.  The
remaining examination was unremarkable.  She was transfused
one unit of packed red blood cells for a hematocrit of 26.2.
She remained in the Medical Intensive Care Unit.  On
postoperative day four, overnight events were none.  There
was no nausea or vomiting; some diarrhea and she remained
afebrile.  She continued on her Zosyn and Vancomycin.  Wound
dressings were normal saline, wet-to-dry.  Her diet was
advanced and ambulation was begun.

Physical Therapy was requested to see the patient.  She was
transferred to the Regular Nursing Floor.  Infectious Disease
followed the patient during her perioperative period and
prior to discharge.  C. difficile cultures were sent for the
diarrhea which both were negative.  Her wound cultures grew
Methicillin sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, sensitive to
penicillin and amoxicillin.  Physical Therapy saw the
patient.  She required full assist for ambulation.  They felt
that she would be a candidate for rehabilitation.  Case
management began screening.

Final recommendations of Infectious Disease were that the
organisms were Gram positive cocci, sparse growth, suggesting
alpha Strep, sparse growth of diphthoids to colony
morphology, Staphylococcus aureus, rare growth,
Staphylococcus was sensitive to Clinoidally and Erythromycin,
Gentamycin, Lobaplatin and Oxicillin.  It was penicillin
resistant.  There was E. coli which was sensitive to
Ampicillin, Gentamicin, Pentacillin, Lobaplatin, Piptaz,
Tobramycin, Bactrim.  Anaerobic cultures grew bacteria of
Phrugellis, sparse growth, beta lactamase positive.

Recommendations were to continue the Zosyn until just before
discharge, then begin the patient on Lobaplatin just before
discharge, then begin the patient on Lobaplatin 500 mg q. day
and Flagyl 500 mg three times a day.  This is for an
indefinite period of time until the wound is completely dry
and non-draining.

The patient was discharged in stable condition to a
rehabilitation.  Wound Care is dry sterile 4 by 4 packing
with ABD dressings which should be done under sterile
technique.  She will follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in two
weeks.  The wound was without erythema.  It is deep.  The
base is clean with beginning granulation tissue.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Aspirin 81 mg q. day.
2.  Flagyl 500 mg three times a day.
3.  Lobaplatin 500 mg q. day.
4.  Lasix 50 mg q. day.
5.  Zantac 150 mg twice a day.
6.  Atrovent inhaler puffs two four times a day.
7.  Lasix 40 mg twice a day.
8.  Atenolol 50 mg twice a day; hold for systolic blood
    pressure less than 100, heart rate less than 50.
9.  Captopril 100 mg three times a day; hold for systolic
    blood pressure of less than 100.
10. Percocet tablets one to two q. four hours p.r.n. for
    pain.
11. Clonidine 0.1 mg p.o. three times a day.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Wound dehiscence with graft rupture, status post
    exploration ilial-femoral bypass with [**Doctor Last Name 4726**]-Tex and wound
    debridement.
2.  Hypertension, controlled.
3.  Renal artery stenosis, stable.
