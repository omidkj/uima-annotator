Service: NEUROLOGY

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7573**]
Chief Complaint:
Seizures

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation

History of Present Illness:
69 RHM with a history of mental retardation, CHF, DVT/PE for
which he is on coumadin, depression, and seizure d/o for which
he was hospitalized in [**2-3**]
for status epilepticus (thought to be [**2-27**] infection), presents
now with two generalized tonic clonic seizures, the first which
broke quickly after 10 mg of valium, and the second, which was
reportedly longer in duration, broke after 8 mg ativan and the
first dose of vecuronium prior to intubation. His seizure may be
the product of insufficient AED coverage (as his dilantin level
at [**Hospital1 46**] was
2.8).

At baseline as per NH ([**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]): he is alert, oriented, still
thinks his mother is alive (she died 2 years ago). Self propels
a wheelchair. Needs 2 to hoist him out of bed, depended with
feeding and self care. MR due to anoxic brain injury (forceps
injury, also has a 66 yo brother [**Name (NI) 2259**] with anoxic brain
injury). Had a R leg DVT, L hip # and repair, and a PE around
[**2151**], on Coumadin.

Re: AEDs - Saw a neurologist at [**Location (un) **], previously on PHB and
Dilantin (500 mg total daily). Keppra started in [**Month (only) **] after his
[**Hospital1 **] admission, and then increased to 1500 mg on [**2158-5-22**]. His
Dilanting was decreased to 100 mg tid during that admission,
with the plan to titrate it down further on [**2158-6-19**].

According to brother [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) **] [**6-5**] at 1 am, he was moving
his head from side to side with a presumed seizure, not his
"usual GTC seizure as in [**2-3**]."

Pertinent Results:
[**2158-6-5**] CT head
No acute intracranial process.

[**2158-6-5**] LENIs
No evidence of DVT of the left lower extremity.

[**2158-6-5**] CXR
This current radiograph demonstrates the NG tube tip being at
least at the
proximal stomach. The bibasilar atelectasis has slightly
worsened in the
interim. The lung volumes are very low. There is no interval
increase in
pleural effusion and there is no pneumothorax within the
limitations of this suboptimal technique study.

[**2158-6-5**] EEG

MR head: Limited by motion. significant atrophy.

Brief Hospital Course:
69 yo RHM with hx MR, CHF, DVT/PE for which he is on coumadin,
depression, and seizure d/o for which he was hospitalized in
[**2-3**] for status epilepticus (thought to be [**2-27**] infection),
presents now with GTC seizures x 2, the first which broke
quickly after 10 mg of valium, and the second, which was
reportedly longer in duration, broke after 8 mg ativan. His
seizure may be the product of insufficient AED coverage (as his
dilantin level at [**Hospital3 3583**] was 2.8, prior to the
Fosphenytoin load).

At baseline as [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Location (un) 582**] NH ([**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]): he is alert, oriented
to himself, he still thinks his mother is alive (she died 2
years ago). He self propels a wheelchair. Needs 2 to hoist him
out of bed, depended with feeding and self care. MR due to
anoxic brain injury (forceps injury, also has a 66 yo brother
[**Name (NI) 2259**] with
anoxic brain injury - same OB!). Had a R leg DVT, L hip # and
repair, and a PE around [**2151**], now on Coumadin.

Re: AEDs - Saw a neurologist at [**Location (un) **] (asked [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] and Dr
[**First Name (STitle) **], Dr [**First Name (STitle) **] mentioned that he would have to delve into the
records), previously on PHB and Dilantin (500 mg total daily).
Keppra started in [**Month (only) **] after his [**Hospital1 **] admission, and then increased
to 1500 mg on [**2158-5-22**]. His Dilantin was decreased to 100 mg tid
during that admission, with the plan to titrate it down further
on [**2158-6-19**].

According to brother [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) **] [**6-5**] at 1 am, he was moving
his head from side to side with a presumed seizure, not his
"usual GTC seizure as in [**2-3**]."

He had a CT head on [**6-5**], and this showed no acute intracranial
process. [**2158-6-5**] Admitted to neuro ICU as he was intubated and
ventilated, converted to CPAP immediately on transfer from the
ER to neuro ICU, and he was extubated on the same day. He was
kept overnight in the unit, to permit the sedation to wear off.

Once in th efloors he remained at his baseline. No seizure
activity was recorded.
