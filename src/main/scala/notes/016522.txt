IMPRESSION:
1. Uncomplicated sigmoid diverticulitis with a question of tiny
9-mm fluid
collection within the sigmoid wall, which is too small to drain.
No
extraluminal gas.
2. 2.3 x 1.8 cm area of thickening along the left aspect of the
rectum is
mass-like, though may represent adherent stool. Given these
findings, we
recommend followup imaging or direct visualization following
improvement of
the patient's acute symptoms.


Brief Hospital Course:
77yo female with h/o of asthma/COPD, DMII, paroxysmal Afib and
early dementia presents with SOB and abdominal pain, admitted to
the ICU after having unstable atrial flutter in the ED.
.
1. Atrial Flutter. Patient unstable in ED secondary to fast rate
(HR 190s) and poor fluid status from GI illness. She had not
been taking diltiazem while ill. She responded to cardioversion
and was maintained on PO diltiazem. In the ICU she remained in
NSR without aflutter. She was sent home on diltiazem 240mg
daily. Coumadin was temporarily held due to supratherapeutic
INR. She was given 1mg Vit K for an INR in the range of 7. At
the time of discharge her INR was 1.9 and resumed her coumadin.
She will follow up at [**Hospital **] clinic early this coming week.
.
2. Diverticulitis. Pt had LLQ abdominal pain revealing
uncomplicated diverticulitis. Pt was started on Cipro and Flagyl
and transitioned from clears to regular diet which she
tolerated. She will complete a total 14 day course of
antibiotics. Her INR will need careful monitoring as both Cipro
and flagyl interact with coumadin. [**Hospital **] clinic was
contact[**Name (NI) **] and will follow up with patient.
**She will need outpatient colonoscopy within 6 weeks
.
3. Asthma exacerbation. Mildly elevated eos. She was given 5 day
