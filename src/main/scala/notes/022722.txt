Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1515**]
Chief Complaint:
dyspnea on exertion

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Percutaneous Aortic Valve replacement
Temporary pacing wire placement


History of Present Illness:
89F CAD, s/p 5 vessel CABG in [**2162**], HTN, hyperlipidemia, and
hypothyroidism. Of note the pt is s/p evaluation for
percutaneous aortic valve replacement at the [**Hospital6 13185**] with [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] transcatheter aortic valve prosthesis
last year but they felt her iliofemoral arteries were too small
and tortuous for percutaneous approach.
.

IMAGING/STUDIES:
ECHO ([**5-24**])
PRE VALVE DEPLOYMENT The left atrium is dilated. Mild
spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body of the left
atrium. No mass/thrombus is seen in the left atrium or left
atrial appendage. Mild spontaneous echo contrast is present in
the left atrial appendage. The left atrial appendage emptying
velocity is depressed (<0.2m/s). No atrial septal defect is seen
by 2D or color Doppler. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. There
is moderate global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 35 %).
The right ventricular free wall demonstrates mild global free
wall hypokinesis. There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the
descending thoracic aorta. There are three aortic valve
leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets are severely
thickened/deformed. There is critical aortic valve stenosis
(valve area <0.8cm2). Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial effusion. Drs.
[**Last Name (STitle) **], [**Name5 (PTitle) **], and [**Doctor Last Name 914**] were notified in person of the results
in the operating room at the time of the study.

POST VALVE DEPLOYMENT Both right and left ventricular systolic
function are improved. The mitral regurgitation is improved -
now trace mild. The percutaneous aortic valve is in situ. After
initial deployment, significant aortic regurgitation was seen on
the mitral valvular aspect of the valvular apparatrus. After
re-balooning of the valve, the aortic regurgitation was reduced
to mild. Another small jet was seen on the opposite side but
this was only trace in severity.. The maximum gradient across
the aortic valve was 6 mmHg with a mean of 3 mmHg. There was no
pericardial effusion.

ECHO ([**5-25**])
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. An
aortic CoreValve prosthesis is present. The transaortic gradient
is normal for this prosthesis. Trace aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. No mitral
regurgitation is seen. The left ventricular inflow pattern
suggests impaired relaxation. The estimated pulmonary artery
systolic pressure is normal. There is no pericardial effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2174-4-6**], a
Corevalve prosthesis is in place. There is a normal
transvalvular gradient and trivial aortic regurgitation. The
severity of mitral regurgitation and pulmonary hypertension are
reduced.

ECHO ([**5-31**])
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF>55%). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left
ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). An aortic CoreValve
prosthesis is present and appears well-seated. The transaortic
gradient is normal for this prosthesis. No aortic regurgitation
is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Physiologic mitral regurgitation is seen (within normal limits).
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is
borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. Significant
pulmonic regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardia
