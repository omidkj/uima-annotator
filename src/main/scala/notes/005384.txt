Brief Hospital Course:
32yo M presented to trauma bay as trauma stat intubated with
hemodynamic stability, flail chest. CXR demonstrated persistence
of L tension PTX with both L-sided chest tubes located
extrapleurally.  They were both removed as a new 36Fr L-sided
chest tube was placed with appropriate re-expansion of the lung.
 Transient hypotension in the trauma bay responded to IVF and
transfusion of 1u PRBC.  Imaging included CT spines revealing
only a T4 BL transverse process fracture.  Other injuries
included L rib fx's of ribs [**1-18**] posteriorly with displacement,
ribs [**5-19**] anteriorly with flail chest, L clavicular fracture, and
grade 1 liver laceration with subcapsular hematoma.

Admitted to T-SICU under the Trauma (West3) Surgery service.  A
CVL was placed via R subclavian.  A thoracic epidural was placed
by the acute pain service for pain control and utilized until HD
5.  Vent weaning was difficult due to his poor chest wall
mechanics related to his rib fractures / flail.  He developed a
Neisseria and MSSA PNA on HD 3, manifested as a fever, and was
treated with Vanco/Zosyn/Cipro.  A chest CT showed bibasilar
consolidations consistent with aspiration pneumonia.  He
continued to spike fevers up to HD 10. Work-up included
re-culturing, CXR, and BAL which were unremarkable.  Repeat
Chest CT showed resolution of the consolidations, although with
development of BL pleural effusions.  The CVL was changed over a
wire.  Further cultures remained negative (the BAL showed coag +
staph and yeast at levels below threshold for infection).  WBC
peaked at 19.4 on HD 11 and gradually downtrended to normal.
Antibiotics were discontinued on HD 14.

The R-sided chest tube was removed on HD 4.  The L-sided chest
tube was removed on HD 7.  To facilitate his vent weaning and to
provide nutritional access, a PEG and percutaneous tracheotomy
(8.0 portex) were placed at the bedside on HD 6.  TFs were
shortly resumed and advanced to goal, tolerated with bowel
function.  Promitility agents (reglan and erythromycin) were
added due to an episode of abdominal distension and high
residuals, with resolution of symptoms, and later discontinued
due to diarrhea.

Eventually his mechanics improved such that he tolerated trach
collars trials for a few hours at a time.  Agitation then became
a difficult issue.  Initially managed with clonidine patch,
methadone dosing that peaked at 20 [**Hospital1 **], ativan prn, and
occasional haldol.  Psychiatry consult was obtained for
guidance.  Weaning of ativan and methadone was begun in order to
reduce the polypharmacy.  The trach was changed to a 6.0
fenestrated non-cuffed tube which he tolerated nicely.

Skin care of his multiple sites of road rash was with adaptics,
with gradual improvement.

Pt pulled out trach on [**10-5**].  Occlusive dressing was placed over
the tracheostomy site and trach site was observed for 24 hours.
Pt maintained >95% saturations without the trach. Pt was
transferred to the surgical floor and was discharged in good
condition to rehab on [**10-7**].  Pt was afebrile, voiding, pain well
controlled, and maintaining good saturations.
