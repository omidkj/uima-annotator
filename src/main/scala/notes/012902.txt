.
CXR [**2144-1-21**] - Portable AP chest film was performed and compared
with the portable AP chest film from [**2144-1-19**].

The patient is status post median sternotomy and CABG.
Cardiomegaly is present with no significant change in comparison
to the previous study. There is no evidence of pulmonary edema.

There is slight improvement in the left lower lobe consolidation
and slight decrease in small left pleural effusion is also
noted.

IMPRESSION: Slight improvement in the left lower lobe pneumonia.

Brief Hospital Course:
This is an 83 y/o female with PMH significant for depression,
CHF, CAD, s/p recent admission for PNA, now presenting with
confusion, poor po intake.

1. Mental status changes - likely multifactorial [**1-16**] infection,
dehydration, renal failure, back to baseline per husband and
family after gentle hydration. She also appears depressed, and
will benefit from a psychiatry consult at rehab. Likely
underlying dementia as well. No underlying signs of infection
given negative cultures. She should continue to follow with
behavioral neurology as well
.
2. Hypotension - briefly hypotensive on admission to 70's SBP.
This resolved rapidly with gentle hydration. This hypotension
was likely [**1-16**] to dehydration, and her lactate also normalized
with fluids. Her anti-hypertensives were restarted and her BP is
stable in the 120's-130's.
.
3. Pneumonia - covered transiently for possible
hospital-acquired with Zosyn. Urine legionella pending, never
produced sputum for culture. As no sign of infectious process,
Zosyn d/c'ed after 2 days. CXR on [**2144-1-21**] showed resolving PNA.
.
4. Acute renal failure - likely prerenal in setting of decreased
po intake, infection.  Resolved back to baseline with gently
hydration with Cr 1.0-1.1
.
5. CHF - EF of 20% - Was monitored off medications for first 2
days, restarted on BB and ACEI once creatinine normalized and
BPs climbed to 160s. No current symptoms of volume overload.
Continue strict I/O's and daily weights and she may need lasix
prn depending on symptoms. She was on 20 mg of lasix daily at
home.
.
6. CAD - As above, transiently held ACEI and BB, restarted
before leaving ICU. Stable, no active symptoms.
- no evidence of acute ischemic issues
- Monitored on tele with no evidence of arrhythmias.
.
7.  Hx CVA/ Seizures - contued depakote for seizure ppx as per
outpt regimen. No active symptoms.
.
8.  DM2 - held glyburide in setting of renal failure as is
renally cleared and could precipitate hypoglycemia. Also as she
is eating less, would continue insulin sliding until she is
eating more and sugars are stable.  Continue diabetic diet.
.
9. Depression - on sertraline and olanzapine. Due to
oversedation, olanzapine was d/c'd on [**2144-1-23**]. She needs a
psychiatric evaluation at rehab as she appears more depressed
and her poor po intake may be secondary to that.
.
10. Anemia - baseline 27-30, secondary to ACD. Stable Hct. [**Month (only) 116**]
benefit from checking SPEP/UPEP in future as outpatient to r/o
other processes.
