CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Ruptured aneurysm.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient had the onset of
acute pain and near syncope and was admitted to an outside
hospital and then transferred here after the diagnosis of
ruptured aneurysm was made.  The patient underwent emergent
surgery.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was emergently taken to the
Operating Room and underwent an abdominal aortic repair,
open.  He was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit for
continued care.

On [**2114-11-7**], the patient underwent a split primary
closure and a G-tube placement.  Attempt to wean was tried on
[**11-8**] without success.

The patient developed fever and was pancultured.  He grew
yeast from his sputum.  He was begun on
Levofloxacin and Fluconazole.  On [**2114-11-10**], he was
placed on PAP.

His right central line was changed to a triple-lumen catheter
on [**11-12**].  On [**11-15**], he was extubated.  Physical
Therapy began to evaluate the patient and treated him on a
daily basis.

Speech and Swallow evaluated the patient, and he had positive
signs of aspiration with liquids.  He was continued NPO, and
TPN was continued.

The patient was begun on G-tube feeds and transferred to the
VICU on [**2114-11-17**].  He had some episodes of
hypernatremia requiring additional intravenous fluids.  He
underwent a video swallow on [**11-21**] which demonstrated
aspiration, and he had an inability to cough.  He was
continued NPO, and nutrition was supported with TPN and
G-tube feedings.

The patient returned to the Intensive Care Unit on [**11-23**] secondary to respiratory insufficiency, chronic renal
insufficiency with acute renal failure.  He was begun on
Vancomycin, Zosyn and Flagyl at this time.  He required
transfusion, 1 U packed cells, and on [**11-26**], he was
transferred back to the VICU.

A repeat video swallow was done on [**11-28**], which the
patient failed.  On [**12-4**], the patient became febrile,
tachycardiac, with question of pulmonary embolus.
Intravenous Heparin was started empirically.

A swallow the day before noted that the patient continued to
aspirate, although pureed solids and thin liquids were
instituted.

The patient remained septic requiring
ventilatory
support and required additional antibiotics for his MRSA
pseudomonas pneumonia.

On [**12-7**], the patient continued to be persistently
afebrile.  CT of the abdomen was obtained which showed fluid
around the left kidney.

The patient was instituted on Ceftazidime for pseudomonas
pneumonia.  He showed improvement after the Ceftazidime was
instituted and transferred back to the VICU on [**2114-12-10**].

Hematology was consulted because of his pancytopenia.  They
felt this was all secondary to poly-pharmacology, and with
adjustment of his medications, his pancytopenia improved.
Tube feeds, half-strength Nepro 50 cc/hr was instituted.

On [**12-17**], his antibiotics were discontinued.  He was
begun on p.o. clears only.  He continued to be monitored for
aspiration.  He was followed by Physical Therapy and
discharged in stable condition.
