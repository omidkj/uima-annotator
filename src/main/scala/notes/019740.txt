Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7299**]
Chief Complaint:
Transfer from OSH for gallstone pancreatitis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
ERCP with CBD dilatation, balloon extraction of a small stone,
and sphincterotomy on [**2180-12-11**].


History of Present Illness:
83 year-old male with a history of ischemic cardiomyopathy (EF
10-20%), s/p mechanical AVR on coumadin [**2152**], s/p biventricular
ICD, HTN, HL, thrombocytosis, s/p CCY in the [**2162**] who
transferred from [**Hospital6 33**] with gallstone
pancreatitis. The patient states that 2 days prior to admission
he developed 5 episodes of soft, semi-formed, dark brown bowel
movements. He then developed epigastric abdominal pain without
radiation. The pain was rated [**5-11**], constant "irritating" pain
that was worse with movement. He denied worsening with food. He
stated he felt warm on occasions and some chills, but no fevers.
He also had some nausea, but no vomiting. He presented to [**Hospital **] ED today. At the OSH labs were remarkable for a lipase in
the 6566 and CT that showed gallstone pancreatitis. He was given
IVF at 150cc/hr, morphine & zofran and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for
further management. His INR was 2.5.

In the ED, 97.1 68 95/64 16 98%. The patient's labs were
significant for lipase of 2688, TBili 2.8 with otherwise normal
LFT. His Hct was 33.1, WBC 9.9 with normal differential and
lactate of 1.2.  He was empirically covered with Zosyn in the
ED. His creatinine was 1.3 on arrival. The OSH CT abd/pelvis was
re-read and showed a 6mm x 8mm calcified stone at the ampulla of
Vater resulting in dilation of the intra & extrahepatic ducts
and pancreatic duct. There was also a 24mm cystic lesion of the
uncinate process of the pancreas as well as a 8mm lesion in the
proximal body. He was given morphine & zofran for his pain and
nausea. He was given 1L IVF in the ED. ERCP was contact[**Name (NI) **] and
plan for ERCP when INR is 1.5 unless develops signs of
cholangitis at which point they would take him emergently.

Pertinent Results:
.
Radiology
CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST Study Date of [**2180-12-8**] 8:09 AM
IMPRESSION: 1. 8-mm stone in the ampulla of Vater with dilation
of the common bile duct and both pancreatic ducts, suggestive of
obstruction at the ampulla of Vater. 2. Multiple pancreatic
cysts, which given size should be evaluated with follow-up
ultrasound in 6 months. 3. Splenomegaly 4. Right 2.3-cm
parapelvic renal cyst which could be further evaluated with
ultrasound if it has not been evaluated previously. 5. Right
bladder diverticula. 6. Colonic diverticulosis without evidence
for inflammation.
.
ERCP Impression:
Cannulation of the biliary duct was performed with a
sphincterotome using a free-hand technique
A moderate diffuse dilation was seen at the biliary tree with
the CBD measuring 14 mm.
There was a filling defect in the distal CBD.
A sphincterotomy was performed in the 12 o'clock position using
a sphincterotome over an existing guidewire.
A small stone was extracted with a balloon catheter.
Excellent drainage of bile and contrast was noted

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 65584**] was admitted with gallstone pancreatitis and was
treated with IV antibiotics and bowel rest while his INR came
down over 48hrs.  He was taken for ERCP with stone extraction &
sphincterotomy on [**12-11**]. 24 hours after his procedure he was
restarted on anticoagulation given his mechanical aortic valve
and his post-procedure course was complicated by a slow GI bleed
and bile duct obstruction thought to be a post-sphincterotomy
site hematoma. Pt was treated with IV unasyn and supportive
care.  He had spontaneous resolution of bleeding after stopping
Aspirin and only required a single prbc transfusion.  He
developped volume overload after initial fluid resucitation due
to his baseline systolic CHF (EF 15%) and required IV diuresis.
He was maintained on carvedilol and a decreased dose of
lisinopril. His INR was maintained between [**1-4**] for his
mechanical valve and it was 2.1 on the day of discharge, hct was
26.  Pt was instructed to continue Coumadin 2.5mg daily with the
plan for follow up labs to be drawn on [**12-25**].  He was instructed
to stop taking Aspirin until he is seen in follow up by his
primary care physician.
.
# Pt was monitored on telemetry due to his ICD and baseline
ischemic CMP. He was noted to be having abnormal pacer spikes.
This was reviewed by EP consult team on [**12-8**] and they felt that
there was nothing to worry about but some adjustments were made
to sensing parameters on his device.
.
#Incidental findings on CT that will need follow-up, a letter
has been sent to PCP
1) Multiple pancreatic cysts - recommend f/u in 6 months
2) right parapelvic renal cyst, incompletely characterized but
likely simple cyst
