Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2160**]
Chief Complaint:
Hypoxic Repiratory Failure

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation


History of Present Illness:
This is a 66 y/o female well known to [**Hospital1 18**] with Castleman's
syndrome, recurrent aspiration PNA, HTN, who presented to the ED
this AM with fever and hypoxic respiratory distress. She was
recently admitted to the medicine service from [**2190-9-9**] to [**2190-9-10**]
s/p fall x 2 at home. She reportedly fell on [**2190-9-8**] while trying
to get up from bed and was put back by her HHA; she fell again
on [**2190-9-9**] and was down for approx 3 hours, and was put back into
her bed by her HHA. EMS was then called. No LOC. CT of the head,
c-spine, b/l hips were unremarkable. Fall was felt to be
mechanical in nature and SW was consulted re: question of elder
abuse/neglect (denied by patient to SW). At midnight that night,
she spiked to 102 and was pan-cultured and received tylenol. U/A
was unremarkable but urine cx was significant for 10,000-100,000
GNR. CXR was unremarkable. She was further admitted to the
medicine service for observation and placement. She was
subsequently discharged to home in stable condition yesterday
evening.
.
Of note, she was also recently at [**Hospital1 18**] from [**2190-8-19**] to [**2190-8-27**]
for aspiration PNA, fever, and subsequently grew out MRSA (pt
has h/o MRSA in sputum in past) and pseudomonas (sensitive to
ceftaz/cefepime/meropenem, resistant to levofloxacin).
.
She was brought to the ED this AM by her HHA for a temp to 102
at home this AM. She was also found to be hypoxic at 80%/RA by
EMS. On arrival to the ED, she was intubated for hypoxic
respiratory distress. Her VS in the ED were T 102, BP 150/62, HR
140, RR 26, SaO2 80%/RA. She had transient hypotension with
SBP's to the 90's, thought to be secondary to per-intubation and
received 3 L NS with good response of her SBP to the 110's.
Sepsis protocol was initiated. She received 1 gm Vanc, 500 mg
Flagyl, 500 mg Levofloxacin, Ceftaz 2 gm IV, Versed/Fentanyl
gtt, and 1 gm Tylenol pr.

Admission CXR
INDICATION: 66-year-old woman with hypoxia, shortness of breath
and fever status post endotracheal intubation and left internal
jugular line placement.
.
Portable AP chest dated [**2190-9-11**] at 9:37 a.m. is compared to the
same examination from two hours earlier. The endotracheal tube
terminates 8.1 cm above the carina. Again seen is a linear
density adjacent to the endotracheal tube which terminates at
the thoracic inlet. Again this may represent a malpositioned
nasogastric tube that perhaps is coiled in the posterior
pharynx. It is not seen below the thoracic inlet. There has been
interval placement of a left internal jugular central venous
catheter which terminates at the brachiocephalic-SVC junction.
The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged. Again, the lung
fields show platelike atelectasis within the left mid lung zone.
There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion. The surrounding
osseous structures are unremarkable. Again, the soft tissue
surrounding structures show mild gastric distention.
.
CT Pelvis:
FINDINGS: Several acute fractures are identified. There is a
nondisplaced fracture of the left sacrum extending through
several sacral ala. There is a comminuted fracture of the
anterior column of the left acetabulum with minimal
displacement. There is an acute mildly displaced fracture of the
left inferior pubic ramus. Chronic fracture deformities of the
right inferior pubic ramus, right superior pubic ramus, and the
right proximal femur are also identified. Postoperative changes
status post intramedullary rod fixation of the left proximal
femur are seen including a proximal gamma nail and femoral neck
screw. No hardware-related complication is seen. No additional
fracture or dislocation is noted. Multilevel degenerative
changes of the lower lumbar spine are seen including facet joint
hypertrophic changes. A [**Month/Day/Year 500**] island is seen in the left side of
the sacrum. A faint lucent tract in the proximal right femur
likely reflects previous hardware. No additional lytic or
sclerotic lesions are seen.
