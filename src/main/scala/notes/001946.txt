History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 63305**] is a 52 year old Cuban-American man who has resided
in the US for 25 years.  For the past year he has experienced
aches and pains, especially worse in the past six months on
stairs.  He was working and feeling genrally well until the
beginning of [**Month (only) **] when he developed daily fevers to 102.  These
were associated with chills and body aches but no rigors or
nightsweats.  He went to his [**Hospital 6435**] clinic and had a CXR which
was negative but was put on antibiotics and analgesics.  He
remained well for a few weeks but then suffered 2 syncopal
attacks on [**8-8**] and was admitted to [**Hospital3 **] Hosputal
that day.  At LGH, the patient was found to be neutropenic with
72% lymphocytes and a WBC of 0.5.  He was also anemic with a HCT
of 17 and was transfused 2 units of PRBCs.  Further lab tests
upon admission included a leukemia/lymphoma eval which yielded
abundant myeloblasts with a probable diagnosis of AML.  In
addition, >100,000 colonies of E.coli were found in his urine
resistent to Bactrim.  ID put him on Zosyn, Vancomycin and
Diflucan by [**8-15**].

At LGH, he had a negative CT scan of the head done for
dizziness.  CT of the chest and abdomen was performed as part of
the lymphoma workup with the following key findings:  1) R
paratracheal mass (3.2cm)with BL pleural effusions.  2) Multiple
small liver and splenic lesions of intermediate nature.  3)
Small pancreatic lesion (1.6cm) 4) BL inguinal hernias.
Thoracic surgery was consulted and recommended a mediastinoscopy
under general anesthesia when the patient was feeling better.
He was subsequently transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**8-16**] for further
workup at the request of his wife.

Brief Hospital Course:
1.) AML: Leukemia/Lymphoma evaluation at outside hospital
yielded probable AML.  [**8-18**] BMT done at [**Hospital1 18**] confirmed leukemia
(AML) and pt decided to undergo 7+3 induction treatment here.
DAY 1 was [**2169-8-18**], BM bx completed three times, with the latest
report from [**10-2**] showing no evidence of leukemic cells.  Patient
will need maintenance chemo, but was awaiting stabilization of
ID status prior to starting further chemo.
.
2.) Fever and neutropenia/ID:
High fevers persisted, pt had multiple imaging studies including
a CT Chest, Abd Pelvis that revealed multiple splenic and liver
nodules and mediastinal LAD.  Pt was seen by ID and pulm (for
RLL effusion and mediastinal LAD seen on CT scan).  ID thinks
probably infectious source of liver, spleen nodules and
mediastinal LAD.  They asked for several cultures including acid
fast bacilli, legionella, etc.  Pulm completed bronch on [**8-22**],
negative for malignant cells.  Patient developed some diarrhea,
C.diff sent, which was negative on multiple occasions.  Stool
also tested for cryptosporidium/O and P/campylobacter- all of
which were negative.  Patient underwent thoracentesis on [**8-30**],
which showed exudative fluid that grew afb in cultures, although
the afb smear was negative.  All other cultures negative.
Repeat thoracentesis failed to show further afb growth in
culture, was also negative for CMV.  CT chest on [**9-5**] revealed
stable nodules but new pericardial effusion.  Patient started on
4 drug anti-tuberculosis regimen on [**9-8**].  AFB in blood was sent
to state lab and pending.  Repeat AFB smears were neg x 3 and
patient was taken off precautions.  The patient was transferred
to ICU [**Date range (1) 64418**]. When patient returned to BMT, he was placed on
Rifabutin, Ethambutol, Pyridoxine, Clarithromycin for MAC
coverage, as TB+ blood cxs likely MAC vs. TB, anti-TB meds
d/ced, other atypical mycobacteria was also a consideration.
Patient was started on Vanc empirically on [**9-17**] as blood cultures
from [**9-15**] returned [**2-14**] gram + cocci=coag neg staph and those from
[**9-17**].  On [**9-21**], patient underwent a TEE, which was negative for
endocarditis, and a mediastinal LN biopsy, which was positive
for afb on smear and culture.  Patient placed back in
respiratory isolation.  In addition, pleural fluid from [**9-12**]
returned TB PCR positive, therefore patient's abx regimen
changed back to 4 drug anti-tuberculosis coverage.  Vanc was
discontinued as the +blood cultures were thought to be likely
contaminates. [**9-26**], [**9-27**], [**9-29**] AFB smear neg x 3.  Remains in
isolation room as w/ likely disseminated TB w/ pulm nodules.
Patient underwent repeat thorax CT, which showed enlarging
abdominal LN and an increasing number of splenic and liver
lesions.  Amikacin was added to help potentiated anti-TB drug
effects, however this was later discontinued, along with the
clarithromycin, so that patient was only on anti-TB coverage.
Patient underwent a repeat echo and chest x-ray which showed a
small to moderate pleural effusion and a small decrease in the
mediastinal LAD.  The patient was placed on an 11 week steroid
taper (beginning with 60mg prednisone daily) per ID recs to help
lessen risk of constrictive pe
