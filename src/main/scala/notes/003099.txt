[**8-18**] CT abdomen/pelvis: no abscess, PO contrast progresses into
ostomy bag

Brief Hospital Course:
After preoperative chest XRay on [**8-9**], he was taken to OR for ex
lap w/ total abdom colectomy.  Please refer to previously
dictated op note for details of this procedure.  Briefly, an
intraabdominal abscess was found adjacent to a particularly
inflamed region of the sigmoid colon.  This was promptly
drained, and a total colectomy with hartmann pouch & end
ileostomy was performed.  His 15 day postop course was
relatively complicated and can be summarized via organ systems
as follows.

NEURO: He continued his preop ativan for anxiety, but as his
pain improved, he required less anxiolysis & less narcotics.

CV: Right bundle branch block.  1 intermittent episode of postop
atrial fibrillation.  He was rate controlled with lopressor,
which was continued for periop cardiac protection.

RESP: Preoperative pneumonia, which blossomed after surgery.  He
improved with double antibiotic coverage for pseudomonas.  He
currently has O2 sats in the mid 90s on supplemental oxygen & he
receives neb treatments & advair.

FEN: Still markedly over his baseline weight (70 kg), he is
being maintained on a standing lasix dose.  This can be tapered
once he is more euvolemic.  His electrolytes should be checked
regularly while on the lasix.  Nutritionally, he required TPN
for 10 postop days while awaiting stoma function.

GI: The ostomy has been functional for several days now.  He has
tolerated PO nutrition over the last few days without
complication.  He should receive boost supplements TID to
maintain his caloric intake.  He is written for PPI for gastric
prophylaxis while on his steroids.

HEME: stable hct.  He is on DVT prophylaxis with SQ heparin.
His WBC of 15 on discharge is trending downward from the low 20s
last week.  No other issues.

ID: He finished a 2 week course of antibiotics for pseudomonal
pneumonia.  There had been a concern for a persistent abdominal
process, given his high WBC & slow ostomy progression, but an
[**8-19**] CT scan was unremarkable.

ENDO: He was pulsed with high dose hydrocortisone
perioperatively, and was weaned to current dose of 20mg
prednisone without adrenal insufficiency.  He will be further
tapered following his outpatient f/u with Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **].  He
briefly required IV insulin while on TPN & high dose steroids.
