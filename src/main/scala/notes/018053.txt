Chief Complaint:
right lower extremity pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
This is a 38 year-old man with a history of recent possible
pulmonary embolism, cellulitis, type I diabetes, renal
insufficiency who presents with 2-3 days of right lower
extremity pain and edema.  Says it feels similar to when he last
had cellulitis in [**Month (only) 547**].  Has also noticed increased swelling.

Echo:[**2187-5-21**]
Conclusions:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity  size, and systolic function are normal
(LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical  quality, a focal wall
motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Transmitral  and
tissue Doppler imaging suggests normal diastolic function, and a
normal  left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). The
aortic valve leaflets  appear structurally normal with good
leaflet excursion. There is no aortic  valve stenosis. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
structurally normal. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The
pulmonary  artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
There is an anterior space
which most likely represents a fat pad.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2187-2-20**], the
findings are  consistent with normal diastolic function and
normal left ventricular filling  pressures (not fully evaluated
on prior study).
..
v/Q scan:
IMPRESSION:  Normal lung perfusion scan.  Compared with the
prior study, there is no significant interval change.
..
Tib/fib films:
IMPRESSION:  No gas is noted within the soft tissue.  Prominent
soft tissue swelling of the calf region is unchanged compared to
the prior study.
..
[**5-20**] CXR: FINDINGS:  Comparison is made to the chest CT from
[**2187-2-21**], and plain film radiograph from [**2187-5-19**].
Cardiac silhouette demonstrates left ventricular prominence,
which is stable. The right lung is clear.  The left lung
demonstrate some vague opacity in the left retrocardiac region,
however, this may be secondary to atelectasis or due to vessel
crowding from poor inspiratory effort.  No definite
consolidation is identified.  There are no signs of overt
pulmonary edema.




Brief Hospital Course:
Assessment and Plan: This is a 38 year old man with a history of
recent possible pulmonary embolism, cellulitis, type I diabetes,
renal insufficiency who presentsed with right lower extremity
pain/edema.  The following issues were addressed on this
admission:
.
1)Right lower extremity pain/edema: Cellulitis: Patient
maintained on vancomycin/unasyn over the course of his admission
for first 6 days.  (Got zosyn instead of unasyn for a few doses
after he spiked and had respiratory decompensation, please see
below).  Switched to augmentin and remained afebrile with
improvement of cellulitis over the last two days of admission.
No evidence compartment syndrome other than pain.  LENI negative
for dvt (already on coumadin) Anti-fungals maintained
throughout. No evidence of osteo on plain film.  To complete 14
day total course of antibiotics, six more days of augmentin.
Patient has appointment in two days with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for
re-evaluation.
.
2)Fever: on antibiotics, vanc and unasyn on [**5-18**].  Multiple
blood cultures and urine cultures negative.  Initially unasyn
broadened to zosyn and then antibiotics switched to augmentin on
HD#6.  Afebrile on augmentin x2 days prior to discharge.  Likely
from cellulitis.  Blood cultures and urine cultures pending at
time of discharge.
.
2)Respiratory: History of OSA and asthma as well as recent
diagnosis of possible PE. Intermittent shortness of breath
reported on admission.  Initially stable but patient with
decompensation/desaturation [**5-16**] and again [**5-18**] both in early AM
while sleeping. [**5-18**] event required ICU admission. Also febrile
at this time.  Felt to be secondary to not being on his usual
home CPAP.  Because of history of prior possible PE, V/Q scan
repeated and demonstrated no PE.  Cardiac enzymes cycled and
negative, ECG without concerning changes, cxr unremarkable.
Echo checked and no evidence of heart failure.
.
3)Acute renal failure/CKD stage 3: Patient developed renal
failure in setting of fevere, hypoxia on [**5-18**]. Patient
hypovolemic, likely pre-renal. Ace, hctz held, patietn hydrated
and bp allowed to auto-regulate.  patient's creatinine returned
to baseline of low 2's.  Continuing to hold ace, hctz through
discharge, to be re-started at discretion of Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and
[**Doctor Last Name 4920**].  Should have repeat chem-10 on [**5-24**]
Consider MRA to look for renal artery stenosis as outpatient.
SPEP/UPEP without concerning abnormalities.
.
4)Alkaline phosphatase elevation: should have repeat testing as
outpatient, no acute pathology noted.
.
5)Possible recent PE: On last admission, decision made to
maintain coumadin x 6 months. Maintained on coumadin throughout,
inr therapeutic.  Discharg
