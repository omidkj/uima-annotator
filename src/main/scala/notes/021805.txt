Brief Hospital Course:
On [**2172-12-9**] [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname **] underwent an aortic valve replacement
with a [**Company 1543**] mosaic ultra porcine valve (21mm).  This
procedure was performed by [**Name6 (MD) **] [**Name8 (MD) **], MD.  The patient
tolerated this procedure well and was transferred in critical
but stable condition to the surgical intensive care unit.  He
was extubated by post-operative day one and he was weaned from
his pressors.  On post-operative day two he was transferred to
the surgical step down floor and his chest tubes were removed.
On the evening of his third pos-operative day, two apneic
episodes were witnessed during his sleep with concomitant
bradycardia.  No further ectopy, bradycardia, or apnea was
noted, but he was told that he would benefit from a sleep apnea
study as an outpatient.  His wires were removed early on
post-operative day four and he was discharged to home later that
same day.
