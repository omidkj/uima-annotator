History of Present Illness:
80M with a h/o COPD and HTN, prostate ca, s/p XRT 10yrs ago,
presents to the ED after 2 days of BRPBPR. Reportedly woke up on
[**2142-9-20**] with sheets soaked with BRB. Got up, showered, denied
N/V/Dizzy/Lightheadedness, denied CP, SOB, went back to bed.
Woke up with less amount of BRBPR, worried, called PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) **] pt,
PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 12533**]: last [**Month (only) **] ([**2142**]) clean c-scope, so nothing to worry
about. Pt went golfing, completed 2 holes, then noted pants
soaked in blood. Went to the ED. Hct 37 reportedly on admission.
In ED, reportedly, [**2-5**] tablespoons every 10-20mins, incontinent
of stool. Still blood with no stool. No hematemesis or
hematochezia. No chest pain, no SOB. no syncope or pre-syncope.
Hct was as low as 29, and pt reportedly given 4units of PRBCs.
Enzymes were checked, and he had a + MB fraction, but no EKG
changes, Trop 0.03 thought to be an NSTEMI due to demand--pt was
asymptomatic.  He was continued on his betablocker, aspirin was
held due to ongoing bleeding. Transferred to OSH ICU, underwent
a c-scope: showed bleed in sigmoid colon and left colon with no
definite source that could be identified. Hct 30.2 on [**9-22**] at
OSH. Hct 37 on [**9-20**]. At least 1 episode of hypoT (BP 89/60) at
OSH, given fluids and 2u PRBCs-->hypoT quickly resolved to Bp
120/80. Notes mention possible need for [**Female First Name (un) 899**] angiography of the
[**Female First Name (un) 899**] to localize the source of the bleeding; therefore pt was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further workup/management.
.
Upon arrival to [**Hospital1 18**], pt denies CP, SOB, dizziness, LH. He was
tachycardic to 120s, other vital signs were stable.  No frank
rectal bleeding, but bright red blood in the rectal vault.

Imaging:
CXR at OSH showed L basilar density, unknown if new or old.
R Foot XRAY: No acute fracture or dislocation is seen.  There is
an
apparent lucency noted in the first distal phalanx.  This
lucency extends to
the articular surface of the interphalangeal joint and has well
circumscribed
but nonsclerotic margins.  This is best evaluated on the frontal
and oblique
radiographs and is not well seen on the lateral radiograph.  No
additional
lytic or sclerotic lesions are seen.  There is enthesopathy at
the insertion
of the Achilles tendon and a small plantar calcaneal spur.
There is also
trace vascular calcification.  The soft tissues are
unremarkable. IMPRESSION:
1.  Apparent well circumscribed lucency in the first distal
phalanx.  Further
evaluation with cross-sectional imaging is advised. 2.  No acute
fracture or dislocation.

.
Colonoscopy at OSH:  bleeding from sigmoid and L colon area.  no
bleeding in terminal ileum, R colon, xverse colon.  multiple
diverticuli in sigmoid colon.   couldn't locate the source of
bleeed.

********************
80M with 2d of BRBPR likely due to diverticular bleed, s/p
c-scope unable to localize source of bleeding, transferred to
[**Hospital1 18**] for further workup and managment of the bleeding.  The
bleeding had slowed dramatically by transfer.  Colonoscopy at [**Hospital1 **]
revealed extensive diverticular disease of the sigmoid colon
without active bleeding.  The patient's Hct stabilized at ~25
for 24 hours, and on [**9-25**] the patient left against medical
advice.  He and his wife stated that they understood that the
medical team wanted to continue to monitor his Hct, to obtain a
PT consult as the patient had been bedbound for 5 days.  The
patient and his wife also stated their understanding that the
patient was at risk to rebleed acutely, which could have
devastating results.
.
#GI: BRBPR- Unlikely upper GI source per colonoscopy, original
bleeding form the sigmoid, left colon per OSH.  At admission the
pt had bright red blood in the rectal vault. He was admitted to
the MICU for close observation initially.  He remained remained
hemodynamically stable; Hct remained ~25 x 24 hours; therefore
he was transferred to the floor on [**9-24**].  A repeat colonoscopy
on [**9-24**] revealed sigmoid diverticular disease but no active
bleeding.  1 unit PRBC's transfused [**9-25**] to maintain Hct >25.
Per GI, the patient should see surgery in outpatient follow up
for consideration of a partial colectomy given his extensive
sigmoid diverticular disease and high risk of re bleeding.

#CV:
Ischemia: CKMB elevation at outside hospital; diagnosed with
NSTEMI.  This is likely due to demand ischemia in the setting of
acute blood loss/anemia.  There was no troponin elevation, no
EKG changes, and the patient was asymptomatic throughout. The
patient was started on a statin and continued on a betablocker.
Aspirin was held given GI bleed. A repeat EKG at [**Hospital1 **] was
unchanged from OSH.  We continued the Betablocker and statin.
The patient will follow up with his PCP for discussion of
initiation of ASA therapy.  Pump: HTN, TTE ot OSH revealed: EF
of 70%, hyperdynamic, with no wall motion abnormalities.
Betablocker was continued; ACE-I was restarted on [**9-25**] (after
stabilization of blood pressure). Rhythm: The patient had
intermittant sinus tachycardia to the 120s, thought to be due to
hypovolemia and + increased catechols.
