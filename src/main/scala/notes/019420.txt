Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 594**]
Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea, hypoxia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
right heart catheterization [**2185-7-25**]

History of Present Illness:
This is a 76 year old male with PMH of stage II COPD with an
FEV1 consistently in the low 60s on 3-5L of home O2, pulmonary
HTN with estimated pulmonary pressures of 84 mm Hg on recent
ECHO [**6-25**], secondary polycythemia, obstructive sleep apnea on
CPAP, diastolic congestive heart failure, and HTN, recently
hospitalized at [**Hospital1 18**] for 4 days in mid-[**2185-6-14**] for dyspnea
deemed to be related to a COPD/diastolic CHF exacerbation, now
re-presenting with dyspnea and hypoxia initially requiring biPAP
initiation in the emergency room but quickly weaned down to his
home oxygen requirement.  He was last admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] with a
similar presentation last month; however, he states that he was
much more short of breath this time around.  During his last
admission he was diagnosed with multifactorial acute respiratory
distress deemed mostly secondary to a COPD and acute on chronic
diastolic CHF flare.  He was treated with an extended prednisone
taper and increasing his home Lasix dose.  He was seen in
follow-up by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] who felt that he had a COPD exacerbation
secondary to a viral URI.  The patient reports that his last
dose of prednisone was the day prior to this admission.  He
feels as though his breathing did not benefit from the
prednisone.  He had been started on high dose prednisone at the
end of [**2185-5-15**].  Of note, he also mentions having chills
starting 2 days ago which seems to have resolved at this point.
He does not recall any appreciable fevers or sweats.  He does
report coughing vigorously starting erlier this week which was
initially productive of clear phlegm, but has now become more of
a dry cough.  He reports that this current flare of his dyspnea
started at the end of [**Month (only) 547**] at which point he was started on
prednisone and he has never really returned to his baseline
since that time.  He does have seasonal allergies and notes that
he was exposed to a fair amount of pollen this spring around the
time that his symptoms flared.  Otherwise, he does not have sick
contacts and his weights have been stable.  He chronically
sleeps on 2 pillows at night.

In the ED, initial VS were: T=99.8, HR=120, BP=117/62, RR=26,
POx=84% on 4L.  He was triggered in the ED for hypoxia.  Per
report, he was mentating well and appeared non-toxic.  He was
initially placed on a non-rebreather which raised his oxygen
saturation to the 90s.  He did well on non-rebreather, but was
eventually found to be tachypneic and was placed on biPAP.  His
oxygen saturations remained in the high 90s on biPAP.  He was
then graduated to a face mask and eventually back down to his
home nasal cannula at 5L.  He was initially given nitroglycerin
and aspirin to rule out if he had any component of ACS.
Cardiology was consulted and he was seen by Dr.[**Name (NI) 3733**] who
found him very short of breath with prompt desaturations seen
with leg lifts and lying down thought to potentially be secodary
to an unrecognized cardiopulmonary shunt.  Labs were significant
for a lactate of 3.1, negative troponin, creatinine of 1.3 up
from 1, and a slighly elevated white count to 12.8. Prior to
transfer to the MICU vital signs were BP=126/69, HR=99, RR=20,
POx=89% on 5L NC.

On arrival to the MICU, he reports that he feels better than
when he was discharged after his last hospitalization.

CXR [**2185-7-22**]
FINDINGS:  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear
unchanged.
Patchy left basilar opacification has mostly resolved.  There is
blunting
along the visualized part of the left costophrenic sulcus
suggestive of a
small effusion. IMPRESSION:  Decreased basilar opacification
with a suggestion of a small
left-sided pleural effusion.
.
CXR [**2185-7-24**]
Heart size is normal.  Tortuous aorta is redemonstrated.  Lungs
are
essentially unchanged in appearance including bibasilar areas of
atelectasis.
Overall the aeration of the left lung has improved.  The amount
of effusion is
small and most likely bilateral.
.
ECHO [**2185-7-25**]
No intracardiac right-to-left shunt is identified after
intravenous injection of agitated saline at rest. TR Gradient (+
