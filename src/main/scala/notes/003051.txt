CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2159-7-16**] 10:31 AM

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)

Reason: eval: R CT placement

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
25 year old man s/p R CT placement
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
eval: R CT placement
EXAMINATION: AP CHEST 10:45 A.M., [**7-16**].

HISTORY: Chest tube placement.

IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**7-10**] and 7:

New right apical pleural tube. No pneumothorax. Decrease
moderate size right pleural effusion. Left lung clear aside from
mild vascular congestion. Heart is normal size. Widening of the
upper mediastinum due to fat deposition and vascular
engorgement. Nasogastric tube ends in the stomach.

CT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST  [**2159-7-15**] 11:29 AM

CT CHEST W/CONTRAST; CT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST

Reason: eval for abcess, loculated fluid collection
Field of view: 48 Contrast: OPTIRAY

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
25 year old man with s/p motorcycle accident, h/o chest tubes,
s/p ex lap for liver lac, now with fevers
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
eval for abcess, loculated fluid collection
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.

25-year-old male status post motorcycle accident with multiple
fractures and hepatic lacerations, now with fever and concern
for intra-abdominal abscess.

COMPARISON: [**2159-7-3**].

TECHNIQUE: MDCT continuously acquired axial images of the chest,
abdomen and pelvis were obtained after 130 mL Optiray IV as well
as oral contrast.

CT OF THE CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST: The tracheostomy remains in
appropriate position. There has been interval removal of a right
chest tube. A nasogastric tube terminates in the stomach. The
heart and pericardium as well as aorta are unremarkable. There
is no pathologic mediastinal, hilar or axillary lymphadenopathy.
There has been interval worsening in a now very large right
pleural effusion with associated total atelectasis of the right
middle and lower lobes. There has been improvement in left
basilar consolidation with residual patchy nodular opacities
more peripherally, possibly representing areas of contusion.

CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST: Again demonstrated is
extensive laceration of the right hepatic lobe, primarily
segments V, VI and VII. This is not significantly changed. The
gallbladder, pancreas, spleen, adrenal glands, kidneys, stomach,
duodenum, and intra-abdominal loops of large and small bowel are
unremarkable. The kidneys enhance and excrete contrast
symmetrically, and the ureters are of normal caliber. There has
been interval resolution of the small bowel obstruction, and
there is free passage of oral contrast through to the ascending
colon. There is a small amount of fluid along the inferior edge
of the liver. There has been resolution of ascites seen
previously to track into the pelvis. No intra-abdominal fluid
collection or abscess is identified.

CT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST: There is a Foley catheter
within the decompressed urinary bladder. The rectum, prostate
gland, seminal vesicles and intrapelvic loops of bowel are
unremarkable. There is no significant free pelvic fluid or
lymphadenopathy.

BONE WINDOWS: Again demonstrated are multiple bilateral
posterior rib fractures as well as fractures of the posterior
spinous processes from T2 through T5 as well as the right
scapula.

IMPRESSION:
1. Interval worsening in now large right pleural effusion with
associated total atelectasis of the right middle and lower
lobes.
2. Improvement in left basilar consolidation with residual
patchy nodular peripheral left lung opacities, probably
representing contusion.
3. No significant change in right hepatic laceration.
4. Multiple fractures as previously described.
5. Near resolution of intra-abdominal free fluid with only a
small amount of residual fluid along the inferior edge of the
liver.

INTERPRETATION:

Findings:

LEFT ATRIUM: Normal LA size.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Normal RA size.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thickness. Normal LV cavity size.
Suboptimal
technical quality, a focal LV wall motion abnormality cannot be
fully
excluded. Overall normal LVEF (>55%). No resting LVOT gradient.


RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTA: Normal aortic root diameter. Normal ascending aorta
diameter.

AORTIC VALVE: Aortic valve not well seen. No AS. No AR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets with trivial
TR. Normal
tricuspid valve supporting structures. Normal PA systolic
pressure.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Pulmonic valve not well seen.

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: Suboptimal image quality - poor echo windows.
Suboptimal
image quality - poor parasternal views. Suboptimal image quality
- poor apical
views. Suboptimal image quality - poor subcostal views.
Suboptimal image
quality - bandages, defibrillator pads or electrodes. Suboptimal
image quality
as the patient was difficult to position. Suboptimal image
quality -
ventilator.

Conclusions:
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are
normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Due to
suboptimal
technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be
fully excluded.
Overall left ventricular systolic function appears grossly
normal (LVEF>55%).
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
The aortic
valve is not well seen. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No
aortic
regurgitation is seen. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic
pressure is
normal. There is no pericardial effusion.
