CXR [**12-30**]
CHEST, PA AND LATERAL

INDICATION: Evaluate for pleural effusion.

FINDINGS: There is status post sternotomy and the presence of
multiple surgical clips in the left-sided anterior mediastinum
is indicative of previous bypass surgery. Cardiac contours are
partially obscured by the presence of pleural and parenchymal
abnormalities but significant cardiac enlargement is most
likely. Also the thoracic aorta appears moderately widened and
elongated. There exist bilateral pleural effusions, more on the
left than on the right. In addition, crowded pulmonary
vasculature and linear densities in the left lower lung field
are indicative of atelectasis and infiltrates coinciding with
the pleural effusions that were already present on the
preoperative chest examination of [**12-24**] and persisted
during the perioperative episodes as seen on chest x-rays of
[**12-26**], 3, and 5.

In comparison with the next previous examination, no significant
interval change can be identified. The now obtained additional
lateral view identifies the pleural effusions to occupy the
posterior pleural sinusesand the basilar area of the interlobar
major fissures. Atelectases and infiltrates are located mostly
in the posterior segments.

IMPRESSION: Grossly stable findings. Postoperative pleural
effusions and atelectasis persist, further followup examination
is recommended.

INTERPRETATION:

Findings:

LEFT ATRIUM: Mild LA enlargement.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Lipomatous hypertrophy of the
interatrial
septum. No ASD by 2D or color Doppler.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Mild symmetric LVH. Normal LV cavity size.
Suboptimal
technical quality, a focal LV wall motion abnormality cannot be
fully
excluded. Mild regional LV systolic dysfunction. Mildly
depressed LVEF.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTA: Normal aortic diameter at the sinus level. Focal
calcifications in
aortic root. Normal ascending aorta diameter. Focal
calcifications in
ascending aorta. Normal aortic arch diameter. There are complex
(>4mm)
atheroma in the aortic arch. Normal descending aorta diameter.
There are
complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.

AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS.
No AS. Trace
AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Moderately thickened mitral valve leaflets. No MS.
Mild (1+) MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets with trivial
TR.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflets.
No PR.

PERICARDIUM: Small pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify
I was present in compliance with HCFA regulations. No TEE
related
complications. See Conclusions for post-bypass data

Conclusions:
PRE-BYPASS: Note: Study interrupted and may appear in system as
2 separate
studies. The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial septal
defect is seen by
2D or color Doppler. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. Due
to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality
cannot be
fully excluded. There is mild to modreate regional left
ventricular systolic
dysfunction with mid to apical septal hypokinesis and mid to
apical inferior
hypokinesis. The apex appears hypokinetic.. Overall left
ventricular systolic
function is mildly to moderately depressed (LVEF 40-45%). Right
ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There are complex
(>4mm)
atheroma in the aortic arc and the descending thoracic aorta.
Epiaortic scan
was preformed prior to aortic cannulation with no large plaques
visible at the
site of cannulation or cross clamp application. The aortic valve
leaflets (3)
are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Trace
aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are moderately
thickened with
possible rheumatic deformity.. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. Mitral
annulular diameter measures on average 2.6 cm. Vena contracta
measures .1-.4
cm with provactive manuvers. Mitral regurgitation is central.
There is no
mitral stenosis.

POST-BYPASS:
Patient is atrially paced on .02 mcg/kg/min epinepherine and .5
mcg/kg/min
phenylepherine infusions.
Biventricular function and wall motion are unchanged. LVEF
40-50% with no
change in inferior and septal hypokinesis. Mitral regurgitation
is trace to
mild. Aortic contours are intact. Remaining exam is unchanged
from pre-bypass.
All findings were discussed with surgeons at the time of the
exam.
