51 yo male with PMH IDDM, CAD (s/p MI), CHF with EF 17%, found
down by family. In PEA arrest upon EMS arrival. Given epi x2 and
atrophine x1. Went into Vfib arrest and shocked 1-2x. Given Amio
300mg x 1. Given IVB. Intubated in the field. Evaluated at
[**Hospital3 **], where he was started on bicarb and dopa gtt. He
is transferred from OSH for further evaluation.
.
Here, pt was given insulin 10U for glucose 400. Found to have
hyperkalemia of 6 and given calcium gluconate, insulin,
kayexalate, continued on bicarb drip. Started on
levo/vanco/flagyl. Pt seized and given dilantin 1gm and ativan
4mg IV. Given IV lasix 80 x1. Bedside echo showed very poor EF
and lots of "bubbles" in heart. Head CT with subtentorial
subdural hematoma, ?clot in sagittal sinus, ? early infarct in L
temporal. Neurosurgery evaluated pt, and did not feel that SDH
was large enough to evacuate.

EKG: difficult to interpret. lots of artifac. no obvious STE.
.
CXR: diffuse patchy opacities, bilateral effusion (L>R)
.
Head CT: subtentorial subdural hematoma; no midline shift; no
tonsillar herniation; possible hyperdense clot in sagittal
sinus; ? loss of grey white matter differentiation in left
temporal lobe raising question of early infarct.
.
Abd CT: dilated, fluid filled loops of bowel with mucosal
thickening and enhancement c/w hyperperfusion in setting of

Brief Hospital Course:
51 yo male with PMH IDDM, CAD, severe CHF, HTN, hx of etoh abuse
found down in PEA arrest and admitted with hypotension, SDH,
?saggital sinus clot, and multi-system organ failure including
liver failure, acute renal faulire, acute respiratory failure,
and cardiovascular collspe.  He was persistantly hypotensive and
requiring pressor support. Neurology and Neurosurgery consults
were obtained. Given his seizures and decreased activity on EEG,
he was felt to have anoxic brain injury. The family wished to
withdraw care.
