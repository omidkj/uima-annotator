History of Present Illness:
(per conversation with PA [**Last Name (un) 27021**] managing patient at [**Hospital1 **])
Patient is a 79 year old male with PMHx of CAD s/p CABG in [**2121**],
COPD (no PFTs available), HTN, Afib, PVD s/p aortofemoral
bypass, gastric and lung masses (per family report both biopsied
without evidence of malignancy) who presents from outside
hospital with history of respiratory distress at OSH. Per
report, the patient was being evaluated at the [**Hospital3 **] in
[**Month (only) 404**] for cardioversion. At this time he was in rapid afib
with secondary CHF. The patient failed cardioversion and was at
this time rate controlled with either a BB or CCB and continued
anticoagulation with warfarin. This hospital course was
complicated by a GI bleed with unrevealing endoscopy and MRSA
PNA treated with Vancomycin. He received IV Bumex for his CHF
and was additionally given steroids/abx for what was felt to be
COPD exacerbation.  The patient was admitted to [**Hospital **] Hospital
on [**2139-12-17**] for ongoing rehab and to complete therapy with IV
diuretics and antibiotic therapy. During this admission the
patient was noted to develop increasing hypoxia felt by clinical
exam and radiograph to be caused by edema. The patient was
diuresed with Bumex at this time. The patient then developed
fevers with worsening LLL infiltrate for which Timentin and
Vancomycin were started. The patient at this time was receiving
oxygen 7-8L/min but remained A+O without additional fevers and
maintained a stable WBC.
.
At 5p.m. today, [**2139-12-25**], the patient was found to be
unresponsive, but with good pulses. An ABG at this time was (per
recall) 7.19/85/50/??. The patient was placed on BiPap with
reported good result. The patient woke up considerably and
repeat ABG after non-invasive ventilation was 7.34/59/59/??.
Patient's vitals at this time were remarkable for mild
hypotension with SBP in the 90's which increased to 110-115 with
fluid bolus. The patient's heart rate was reported to be stable
in the 70's to 80's. A blood sugar was noted to be 450 in this
non-diabetic patient. A Foley catheter was placed with urine
output of 1500cc (without lasix). Although the patient had not
formally failed a S+S eval, suspicion is that given the
patient's frequent episodes of pneumonia in the past 8 months,
he is likely chronically aspirating. A dose of levofloxacin was
additionally given at the OSH and the patient was sent to [**Hospital1 18**]
for further management and care per Dr.[**Name (NI) 5452**] request.

VIDEO SWALLOW EVALUATION: [**2139-12-30**]
SUMMARY:
Pt presented with a mild oral and pharyngeal dysphagia
characterized by poor oral control with premature spillover,
swallow delay and decreased laryngeal valve closure. The pt
silently aspirated thin liquids (i.e. without coughing or throat
clearing) which could not be prevented with strategy use. Pt was
safe for a PO diet of nectar thick liquids and ground
consistency
solids, alternating between every bite and sip. Pills should be
crushed and given with purees at this time.
.
We would also recommend pt be seen by ENT for evaluation of the
vocal cords given that he did have liquids pushing through the
vocal cords combined with his vocal quality are concerning for
incomplete vocal cord closure.
.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Suggest a PO diet of nectar thick liquids and ground
consistency solids.
2. Alternate between every bite and sip.
3. Please give pills crushed with purees.

[**2139-12-25**]: Chest XRay
IMPRESSION:
New left lower lobe consolidation which could be due to
pneumonia/atelectasis.
Prominent right upper lobe peripheral opacity
.
[**2139-12-26**]: ECHO (TTE):
Conclusions:
1. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. LV systolic
function appears  depressed. No clear masses or thrombi are seen
in the left ventricle.
2. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. Trace
aortic
regurgitation is seen.
3. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial
mitral
regurgitation is seen.
4. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension
5. (EF not reported.)
.
[**2139-12-28**]: ECG:
Atrial fibrillation with a moderate ventricular response.
Occasional
ventricular premature beats. Right bundle-branch block. Possible
anteroseptal myocardial infarction of undeterminate age.
Inferolateral ST-T wave changes. Cannot rule out myocardial
ischemia. Compared to the previous tracing  of [**2139-12-26**] no
significant diagnostic change.
.
[**2140-1-1**]: CXR:
AP upright portable view of the chest. Previously noted left
lower lobe opacity and a more patchy right lower lobe opacity
remain present. Residual small patchy opacities in both upper
lobes do not look significantly changed compared to [**2139-12-27**].
Small bilateral pleural effusions remain present. Allowing for
low lung volumes, there is no definite pulmonary edema
