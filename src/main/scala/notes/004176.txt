Brief Hospital Course:
48 y/o male with HTN, HCV, and ESRD (on HD MWF) presenting to ED
c/o facial puffiness and dyspnea on exertion in the context of
missing his previous two dialysis sessions. He completed urgent
HD overnight due to elevated potassium to 7.0 and minimal
ability to make urine at baseline. Repeat potassium was 4.2.
.
# Hyperkalemia/ESRD on HD: likely in the setting of missing his
previous two dialysis sessions. Sessions were missed as he was
couldn't get a ride to dialysis center ([**Hospital1 **]). He received
calcium gluconate, dextrose, and insulin in ED. He was admitted
to MICU where he underwent urgent HD session overnight for 2
hours at 1 K solution. His K was 4.2 on discharge. There was
consideration for additional UF, but patient declined this. He
met with SW to arrange for future assistance and rides to
dialysis center. He will continue nephrocaps on discharge.
.
# HTN: reportedly on clonidine, labetolol, atenolol, and
?lisinopril, and he will continue same medications on discharge.
.
# HCV: unclear status and unclear if he has received treatment
in the past. Has been present for 10 years per patient.

Patient elected to leave the MICU AMA, knowing that his [**Hospital1 18**]
physicians felt it was medically most beneficial if he stayed.
He was made aware of the risks of leaving (fluid overload and
electrolyte imbalances). Patient stated he had an appointment at
[**Hospital6 **] for a fistula mapping and has chosen to
leave against physician [**Name Initial (PRE) 7219**]. Patient is felt to be
competent and able to make this decision.

You were admitted to the hospital for swelling/edema and
shortness of breath in the setting of missing two dialysis
sessions. You received urgent dialysis in the ICU for severe
electrolyte imbalance. Your electrolytes normalized, but the
kidney team recommended you have dialysis again on [**6-21**].  You

leave against medical advise.
.
MEDICATION CHANGES:
- none
You did not know all the doses of the medications you take.  We
called Dr.[**Name (NI) 53740**] office to ask about these but they did
not have the information as you have not been seen there in some
time.  You did tell us you go to [**Hospital1 2177**] for primary care but do not
know your PCP's last name and we could not find this out. Due to
all of this we could not find out what medications you take and
at what dose, and so were unable to give you prescriptions.
.
You met with the social workers to discuss ways to prevent
missing HD sessions. Please use the resources which were
provided for you.

Followup Instructions:
Please follow-up with your PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] [**Hospital6 **].
