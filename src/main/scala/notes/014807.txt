Pertinent Results:
[**2192-10-26**] Echo: The left atrium and right atrium are normal in
cavity size. The estimated right atrial pressure is 0-5 mmHg.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal
cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
The diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels
are normal. The aortic valve leaflets are severely
thickened/deformed. There is critical aortic valve stenosis
(valve area <0.8cm2). No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral
valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to
acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may be
significantly UNDERestimated.] Moderate [2+] tricuspid
regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
As mentioned in the HPI, Ms. [**Known lastname **] was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for
surgical intervention. She underwent appropriate surgical
work-up which included an echocardiogram and dental clearance.
Heparin gtt was started d/t Atrial fibrillation history. She was
treated for her E coli urosepsis with completion of 10 days of
ceftriaxone therapy and was then noted to have minimal pyuria
and VRE in urine. ID was consulted and appropriate antibiotics
were given based on there recommendations. She was eventually
brought to the operating room on [**11-5**] where she underwent a
aortic valve replacement and coronary artery bypass graft x 1.
Please see operative report for surgical details. Following
surgery she was transferred to the CVICU for invasive monitoring
in stable condition. Within 24 hours she was weaned from
sedation, awoke neurologically intact and extubated. She was
tranferred to the floor and continued to progress well.  Chest
tubes and pacing wires were removed per cardiac surgery
protocol.  She was started on coumadin for atrial fibrillation
and INR was monitored daily.  She was seen by ophthamology for
left eye pain and was found to have inflammation of her eye lid.
 She was treated with warm compresses.  She worked with
physicial therapy and was fitted with a prosthetic shrinker.
Repeat urinalysis was done which was negative and the patient
was off antibiotics at the time of discharge.  Her heart rate in
atrial fibrillation elevated and her lopressor was uptitrated.
She was discharged on post op day # 6 in stable condition to
rehab.
