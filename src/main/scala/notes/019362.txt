Brief Hospital Course:
MICU COURSE: The patient was admitted to the MICU service. She
was covered with linezolid for h/o VRE, and zosyn for the E.
Coli UTI/urosepsis. The patient was weaned off pressors,
restarted when SBP decreased to 70s, then weaned off. She
maintained good UOP. Briefly on steriods for a quetion of COPD
exacerbation but this was discontinued by HD 2. On HD 3 the
patient had her femoral line removed and was transferred to the
floor in stable condition for futher monitoring and treatment of
her E. coli UTI.
.
A/P: 73yo F with idiopathic colitis and hx of CVA, PVD, HTN who
was recently admitted to surgery s/p ex lap, s/p E coli
urosepsis vs. colitis and covered with Zosyn/Linezolid (w/
Linezolid d/c'd) s/p MICU from [**Date range (1) 65782**], stabilized, now
transferred to Medicine service.
.
#  Abd pain, Idiopathic colitis: On exam, pt with diffuse abd
pain, worse at suture line.  Pt felt to have resolved sepsis [**2-16**]
colitis vs. urosepsis.  Repeat CT Abd showing no evid colitis,
findings c/w cystitis, and pt being treated with Zosyn day [**8-28**]
of therapy.  Transplant surgery evaluated pt, felt that
mesenteric ischemia unlikely, and that her abdominal pain is c/w
post op pain.  He noted that she had normal flow on angio
[**2197-3-17**]. We continued w/ oxycodone prn and followed her abd exam
closely, which went unchanged since transfer to medical floor.
Her stool cx sent and were all negative, O&P negative, Cdiff
negative. We checked her TSH, and it was slightly elevated at
4.6, but checked free T4 and this was found to be normal.
She is [**Doctor First Name **], ANCA negative (elev CRP, ESR).  She has follow up in
[**Hospital **] clinic to evaluate her transverse colitis, and then should be
scheduled for outpatient colonoscopy.
.
# UTI s/p ?Urosepsis in MICU, resistant E coli [**Last Name (un) 36**] to Zosyn,
nitrofurantoin, cefazolin, ctx. Pt is on day [**8-28**] of Zosyn
therapy, which should cover her broadly for urinary tract
pathogens.  She had a PICC line placed on [**2197-4-6**] for expected
total of 2 weeks of Zosyn.  She continues to be afebrile, with
WBC reflecting eosinophilia recently, most likely secondary to
Zosyn. Her repeat UA was negative X 2, [**2197-4-6**] urine cx
negative.  Her foley catheter was changed [**4-5**] and irrigated.
Urine cytology was sent given her distant history of bladder
cancer, and is pending at discharge.  This can be followed up at
her PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 648**].
.
# Leukocytosis: Pt is being broadly covered with IV Zosyn, which
may be causing the elevated WBC count, which is predominately
eosinophilia most likely [**2-16**] antibiotics.  Her UA and urine cx
negative, blood cx negative, and stool is negative for
bacterial, parasitic, Giardia/Cryptosporidium, and C diff
negative.
.
# Hct drop/Anemia, stable now.  Her hemolysis labs are negative.
 Her ferritin is normal.  Her B12 and folate are WNL.  Her iron
was sent and is pending at discharge.  RN reports the pt's stool
is guiaic negative.  She is to undergo outpatient colonoscopy.
.
2.  HTN: BP well controlled.
We restarted lopressor 12.5mg po bid w/ hold parameters.
.
3.  CV:
A. CAD: Pt w/ risk factors for CAD. H/o PVD.
-cont ASA, statin, BB
.
b.  Rhythm: currently NSR. Has been tachycardic to 100s.
.
c.  Pump: some evidence of lower extremity edema but no JVD.
-CXR showing no vol overload.
-cont BB

-removed staples [**4-7**], with good cosmetic result.
.
5.  Pulm: The pt has a hx of COPD and is on spiriva, alb and
advair at baseline.
Her most recent CXR shows mild interstitial pulm edema,
resolving, and small b/l pleural effusions.  We continued her
outpatient regimen of spiriva, alb and advair.
Her sats continue to be stable on room air.
.
6.  PPx: heparin sub Q TID, bowel regimen.
