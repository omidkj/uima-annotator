Chief Complaint:
Chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
83M with PVD s/p balloon angioplasty to both legs presents with
increasing shortness of breath, bilateral leg swelling x2 weeks,
and substernal chest pain this evening lasting at least 20
minutes. Chest pain occured while he was getting into bed; he
thought it was indigestion and took a tylenol for it, with
eventual resolution in He recently had a toe amputation 1 week
ago [**3-8**] arterial insufficiency and has been relatively less
mobile during this time. He developed some dyspnea with the CP
today and then presented to [**Hospital3 **]. There, CXR showed
pulm edema, also had an elevated BNP and TnI. D-dimer was also
elevated at 393. Lidocaine was started for VT and he was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].
.
In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, afebrile, pulse 80s, BP 100s/60s, RR 28, Sat
80%RA, 100% NRB. Started heparin gtt, ASA, and given lasix 20mg

Physical Exam:
VS:108/62, 82, 22, 96%RA
HEENT: MMM, No appreciable JVD
Heart: RRR, III/VI SEM at URSB
Lungs: Decreased breath sounds in the bases, mild crackles to
midlung, no wheezes, mild rhonchi in L midlung.
Abdomen: Soft, NT, ND, BS+, No HSM
Ext: Partially amputated L second toe w/ 2 sutures in place. No
LE edema. Pedal pulses dopplerable. Radial pulses 2+ and equal.
Neuro: A/OX3, CNII-XII grossly intact w/ slight facial droop to
R.

Pertinent Results:
[**2132-10-18**] echo
The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or
color Doppler. The estimated right atrial pressure is 10-20mmHg.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. There is severe global left
ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 25 -30%). No masses or thrombi
are seen in the left ventricle. There is no ventricular septal
defect. The right ventricular cavity is markedly dilated with
mild global free wall hypokinesis. The ascending aorta is mildly
dilated. The aortic arch is mildly dilated. The aortic valve
leaflets are moderately thickened. There is moderate aortic
valve stenosis (area 1.2cm2). The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. The mitral valve leaflets are elongated. Mild
to moderate ([**2-6**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to
acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may be
significantly UNDERestimated.] The tricuspid valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid
regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

[**2132-10-18**] LE doppler: No e/o DVT

[**2132-10-18**] CXR
EMI-UPRIGHT VIEWS OF THE CHEST AT 12:10 A.M.: There are moderate
bilateral
pleural effusions, with associated atelectasis. Pulmonary
vasculature appears
slightly engorged, and increased opacity at both lung bases
likely reflect
mild pulmonary edema. The heart is enlarged. There is no hilar
or
mediastinal enlargement. There is no pneumothorax. Soft tissue
and bony
structures are notable for convex leftward curvature of the
upper spine, but
are otherwise unremarkable.

IMPRESSION: Moderate bilateral pleural effusions, enlarged heart
and mild
pulmonary edema.


Brief Hospital Course:
83M with PVD, HTN, history of tobacco, presents with CHF and
NSTEMI; hihg-risk features in this patient include the presence
of chest pain at rest, positive biomarkers, CHF signs/symptoms,
and patient already on ASA.
.
# CAD/Ischemia: NSTEMI in pt with existing CAD-risk equivalent.
High risk feature of CHF. Pt. had indigestion on the day after
admission which responded to 2 sublingual nitroglycerin was not
associated w/ ECG changes and did not return. Pt. was initially
scheduled for catheterization, but was unable to lay flat for
procedure due to orthopnea. It was decided that pt. would be
high risk for cath and may require intubation from which he
would be a very difficult wean. It was determined that given his
history of severe PVD he likely has 3vd without a single
intervenable culprit lesion and that he would be a very poor
candidate for CABG given his debilitated state. He will f/u with
cardiologist as an outpt. for possible future catheterization
when he is more able to lay flat. His medical regimen was
optimized w/ ASA, plavix, BB, ACEI and he was diuresed several
liters after which his orthopnea significantly improved. CT
coronaries was considered but decided against because either
result (3vd vs. single lesion) would require a catheterization
for confirmation.

.
 # PUMP: LVEF is 25% with moderate AS (1.2cm2), mild-to-moderate
MR, and severe TR. Pt. appeared severely volume overloaded on
presentation and could not be cathed secondary to orthopnea. He
was diuresed several liters with furosemide and acetazolamide
and his oxygen requirement and orthopnea decreased progressively
with diuresis.
.
#Hypercarbia: pt. was noted to have a compensated respiratory
acidosis in addition to his initial hypoxia. This was not
entirely explained by his pulmonary edema as CO2 is soluble in
water. His mental status improved with diuresis, and an ABG was
not rechecked after he improved but it is likely that his lungs
were stiff from edema fluid increasing the difficulty of
breathing and thus causing him to hypoventilate.
.
# Rhythm: afib, new diagnosis, was started on warfarin,
metoprolol for rate control. Pt. had no episodes of RVR.
.
#HTN: Pt. was initiated on several new antihypertensive
medications and for most of his admission his BP was normal to
low. He had several episodes of SBP in high 70's, usually in the
afternoons when sitting up in the chair during which he mentated
appropriately and produced significant UOP. He was also noted to
be orthostatic by PT. He had been taking midodrine at home but
we did not restart this as he has known PVD and now CAD w/ low
EF. We decreased his diuresis and encouraged PO intake as he
appeared dry on exam.
.
# elevated D-dimer: PE was not very high on the differential as
pt. was short of breath and hypoxic but clearly in florid heart
failure. Pt. was r/o for DVT/PE w/ LE dopplers
.
# Depression: continued home duloxetine 30mg daily and trazodone
50mg QHS.
.
# Macrocytic anemia: Pt. was on B12, thiamine, folate
supplementation. TSH normal. Vitamin B12 and folate studies were
pending on d/c.
