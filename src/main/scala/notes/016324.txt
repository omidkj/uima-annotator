HOSPITAL COURSE:  This is a 74-year-old female who was
diagnosed with nonsmall cell cancer and had received six
weeks of neoadjuvant chemotherapy and was taken to the
Operating Room on [**2187-5-28**] where she underwent an
intraoperative bronchoscopy and mediastinoscopy with an open
thoracotomy and resection of right upper lobe.  This
operation went uneventfully and had a postoperative course
significant for a prolonged air leak and the patient was
ultimately discharged to home by postoperative day number
nine.

One week later, she was seen in the outpatient clinic where
she was noted to have some chest pain, low-grade fever,
lethargy, and was draining some seropurulent material from
her thoracic wounds.  A CT scan of the chest was obtained
which showed a large right-sided hydropneumothorax.  She was
readmitted then on [**2187-6-11**] where she underwent a
CT-guided pigtail aspiration and drainage of the cavity which
revealed a large amount of purulence.  The Gram's stain
revealed gram-positive cocci.

She was taken to the Operating Room on [**2187-6-12**] for
exploration of her right pleural empyema.  She received
vancomycin and Zosyn perioperatively.  Approximately 200 cc
of purulent material was drained from the right lung and she
was decorticated at that time.  Three dependent chest tubes
were placed intraoperatively as well as an apical irrigating
[**Doctor Last Name 406**] drain.  The patient postoperatively was extubated and
sent to the PACU and irrigation of the [**Doctor Last Name 406**] drain was begun
on postoperative day number one with clear serosanguinous
effluence from the chest tube.

Later on that day, she went into atrial fibrillation with
rapid ventricular response and was beta blocked and placed on
an Amiodarone drip.  Later on that night, in the PACU, she
went into progressive respiratory distress and required
intubation with mechanical ventilation.  The following day,
she continued to manifest low-grade temperatures and mild
hypotension with a systolic blood pressure in the 90s
necessitating a Neo-Synephrine drip.  Soon thereafter, she
was transferred to the CRSU.  Her chest x-ray showed
initially low-grade ARDS predominantly unilaterally on the
right hand side; however, she continued to require
ventilation with ventilatory support, P02s in the mid 70s to
80s; however, her chest x-ray began to show bilateral diffuse
interstitial infiltrates consistent with ARDS.  This was
confirmed by placement of a Swan-Ganz catheter and she was
started on a Lasix drip in order to diurese her pulmonary
parenchyma as much as possible.

Her antibiotics were continued with vancomycin and Zosyn and
per ID consult recommendations.  However, she continued to
require increasing doses of Neo-Synephrine and adjustments to
her ventilation and she underwent an echocardiogram on
[**2187-6-18**] which showed a normal ejection fraction of 55% with
no evidence of cardiogenic etiology.  She was noted to have a
decrease in her platelets on [**2187-6-17**] from approximately 130
down to 84 and a HIT screen was ordered which came back
positive.  Her subcutaneous heparin prophylaxis was stopped
and a Hematology consult was obtained.  Hematology
recommended holding off on platelets and Lepirudin for the
time being and ID recommended that Zosyn be changed to Cipro
due to its potential for causing thrombocytopenia.

During this time, she was noted not to be following commands
while her sedation was lightened but she was still moving all
extremities.  A CT of the head was obtained to evaluate for
possible progression of her known stroke disease and this
showed a large right new temporal occipital infarct and a new
left-sided occipital infarct.

Neurologic consultation was obtained and agreed that
anticoagulation would be extremely high risk for this
patient.  She required pharmacologic paralysis with
pancoronium in order to decrease her peak airway pressures on
the ventilator and she was begun on tube feeds which she
tolerated for approximately 24-48 hours but had to be stopped
for increasing high residuals.

A repeat echocardiogram on [**2187-6-20**] showed no evidence of
cardiogenic etiology for her hemodynamic demise.  By
[**2187-6-21**], her condition continued to deteriorate requiring
multiple pressors and increasing FI02 requirements despite
having had tried several modes of ventilator therapy with the
VSICU consulting services making recommendations as well.
Empiric Flagyl coverage was started per ID.  An extensive
family meeting was held on [**2187-6-21**] and given the patient's
worsening cardiopulmonary status as well as her progressive
neurologic injury, the family decided to make the patient DNR
with no increase in cardiopulmonary support at midnight on
[**2187-6-21**].  The patient expired at 6:45 a.m. on [**2187-6-22**]
the following morning.
