Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 465**]
Chief Complaint:
hypotension and bradycardia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
unsuccessful R IJ placement, R femoral venous line placement and
removal


History of Present Illness:
81 yo F with AF, CAD, HTN, who was at home. She c/o SOB and
called her son who called 911. Per the ED, the pt's daughter
thinks that she may have taken an extra dose of her BB on
inspection of her med box. On arrival to OSH, HR 40's in slow
AF. BP dropped there and she was started on dopamine after IVFs
were not helpful. For her possible BB tox, she was given d50,
insulin, ca gluconate, and glucagon. She was sent to [**Hospital1 **] for
possible transcutaneous pacing. On arrival here, her BP was in
the 60's, but then improved with IVFs. Dopa was weaned. A right
IJ was attempted but air was aspirated on needle insertion. A
right femoral line was placed instead. A CXR was neg for PTX.
Admitted to the MICU for bradycardia and hypotension.

Imaging:
[**2116-6-5**]: CXR - The cardiac silhouette is upper limits of normal.
There are dense intramural aortic calcifications. The
mediastinal and hilar contours are otherwise within normal
limits. The pulmonary vasculature is prominent. There is no
pneumothorax. The lungs are clear without consolidations or
effusions. The surrounding soft tissue and osseous structures
demonstrate loss of height of a lower thoracic vertebral body.
.
[**2116-6-6**]: CT torso -
1. No evidence of hematoma within the chest or retroperitoneum
or groin.
2. Small bilateral pleural effusions, with increased ground
glass opacity are most consistent with mild pulmonary edema.
Focal tree-in-[**Male First Name (un) 239**] opacities in the right lower lobe could
represent fluid or mucus impacted bronchi, or possibly
aspiration.
3. 1 cm left upper lobe pulmonary nodule was seen on prior
examination in [**2114**] and is unchanged, consistent with a benign
lesion.
4. 6 mm left lower lobe pulmonary nodule has not been imaged
previously should be followed with chest CT in [**3-17**] months to
confirm stability.
5. Cholelithiasis, without evidence of cholecystitis.
6. Extensive widespread vascular calcification.
7. Heterogenous thyroid with multiple nodules. Thyroid
ultrasound is recommended for further evaluation.


Brief Hospital Course:
In brief, the patient is a 79F with hx of afib, CAD, HTN, DM who
presented from home with suspected BB overdose, hypotension and
bradycardia. Her hospital course was subsequently complicated by
shortness of breath secondary to pulmonary edema in the setting
of hypertension and presumed community acquired pneumonia, and
acute anemia.
.
# Hypotension due to unintentional ingestion of extra dose of
beta blocker and calcium channel blocker. Given glucagon in ER;
on arrival to MICU, HR and BP stable. Her heart rate rapidly
normalized and was restarted on her home dose medications for
blood pressure and rate control. Given her significant response
to (per history) relatively small overdose of metoprolol leading
to significant bradycardia, she could be at risk for tachy-brady
syndrome and may benefit from follow-up with her cardiologist
for discussion of medication titration or pacemaker. This was
the first episode of taking medication incorrectly, and in
discussion with her daughter, she normally does very well with
using a pill box. Her daughter will monitor her use of
medications, and continue using the pill box. If any further
memory problems recur, then an evaluation for cognitive
dysfunction would be warranted.
.
# Shortness of breath: On HD#2, BP meds were held in setting of
hypotension, bradycardia. The patient's HR rose and BP elevated
leading to possible flash pulm edema. The patient received a NTG
drip and lasix with notable improvement. She ruled-out for MI
and had no ischemic EKG changes. She was able to wean down her
supplemental oxygen needs prior transfer from the ICU.  There
was a possible RLL consolidation so empiric antibiotics were
started for community acquired pneumonia. Her home CHF regimen
was gradually re-introduced after holding her ACEi with concern
for her renal function.

.
# ARF: On presentiation her Cr had increased above her baseline.
 This was felt secondary to to the transient hypotension from
the medication overdose as above.  The creatinine began to
recover as her blood pressure normalized.
.
# Anemia: The patient had an asymptomatic Hct drop with no clear
evidence for bleeding source (stools OB-, CT torso no evidence
of hematoma from RIJ attempt or R fem line attempt), also no
evidence of hemolysis given unchanged MCV and RDW. Her
hematocrit started to trend up without intervention.

.
# afib: chronic, restart coumadin at lower dose than home given
that she is now on levaquin. rate control as above.
.
# Gout: patient had a very mild flare of gout symptoms in both
of her feet. She was started on prednisone 20mg qdaily, and
should be titrated down over the course of [**1-14**] weeks. She is
continued on allopurinol which she used at baseline. A once
daily dose of colchicine may help control this flare once her
prednisone is stopped. She became hyperglycemic on this higher
dose, and therefore will have to have her fingersticks carefully
monitored as she is tapered off.
