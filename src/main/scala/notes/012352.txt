see him the day of admission and found him unresponsive.
.
They had last talked to him at 930pm the night prior to
admission when he reported feeling short of breath with a stuffy
nose, which he attributed to seasonal allergies, as well as some
"upset stomach," which he attributed to taking [**Doctor First Name 130**]. He then
said he had to go to make dinner. He didn't report any F/C/N/V
or have any other complaints.

around his mouth. He called the ambulance and pt was brought in
to [**Hospital 882**] Hospital.

At [**Name (NI) 882**], pt was found to have an elevated troponin, an
elevated wbc and a NCHCT showed a new CVA w/out a bleed. His CXR
showed a L consolidation. He received 600mg IV clinda and
albuterol nebs and he was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for futher
treatment and management.

On arrival to [**Hospital1 18**] ED, his BP was 150/59, HR 120s (AF), RR
30s-40s 82% NRB. He was found to be gurgling w/ audible wheezing
and crackles in respiratory distress. He had a short trial of
CPAP while his code status was being clarified. He also received
100mg IV lasix and put out ~ 200cc urine.

When it was determined that pt was not DNR/DNI, pt was intubated
and received 20mg etomidate and 120mg succinate. He was started
on a propofol gtt and a nitro gtt. His BP's subsequently dropped
to SPB 40-50's and his nitro gtt was turned off and he received
IVF (~ 3L total of IV NS). His pressure came back up (he was
briefly on neosynephrine). In the ED he also received 500mg IV
levofloxacin and a central line was placed.

Brief Hospital Course:
On arrival to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], the patient was hypotensive and
tachycardic. In addition, he was in respiratory failure and
therefore intubated and sedated. CXR revealed LUL infiltrate. He
was put on vancomycin and levofloxacin for sepsis, and
levophedrine to keep his blood pressure elevated. Multiple
cultures were sent. He was given fluid boluses. Troponins were
checked which were elevated, suggesting myocardial damage, so he
was given aspirin and diltiazem and lopressor for rate control.
He was ventilated on AC with 60% oxygen and stable O2 sats.

The patient's status declined as he became dependent on
increasing doses of pressors throughout the first day of
admission. The patient's family visited the patient on the day
after admission and made a joint decision that the patient would
not have wanted aggressive measures to keep him alive. The
decision was made to discontinue all treatment except comfort
measures and to extubate him. The patient died within 2 hours of
withdrawl of care at 4:00 pm on [**2194-5-4**] with his family at the
bedside.
