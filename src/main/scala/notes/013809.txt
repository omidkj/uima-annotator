   RADIOLOGY  Final Report

CT CHEST W/O CONTRAST  [**2108-5-27**] 5:42 PM

CT CHEST W/O CONTRAST

Reason: r/o pulm abcess

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
66 year old man with recurrent aspiration PNA , presents c new
worsening PNA despite appropriate atb
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
r/o pulm abcess
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: renal failure

INDICATION: Recurrent pneumonia, evaluate for pulmonary abscess.

COMPARISON: [**2108-1-21**].

TECHNIQUE: MDCT acquired axial images of the chest were obtained
without IV contrast secondary to patient's elevated creatinine
level.

CT OF THE CHEST WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: Linear opacities again seen
at right apex, consistent with scar. New ground glass opacity
and bronchiectasis seen in the right upper lobe. Diffuse patchy
opacities also seen within the upper lobes bilaterally. Large
consolidations are seen at the lower lobes bilaterally, right
greater than left with associated pleural effusions. There is
suggestion of a loculated effusion on the right (series 2, image
24). The left sided consolidation appears improved compared to
[**2108-1-5**] CT. No evidence of abscess seen. 5mm rounded
opacity seen in right lung (series 2, image 22), possibly
secondary to infection.

Coronary artery calcifications are noted. There is also evidence
of mediastinal lymph nodes, none of which appear to meet CT
criteria for pathological enlargement. Limited views of the
upper abdomen demonstrate a gastrostomy tube. Also seen are
rounded hypodensities within the kidneys, likely representing
simple cysts, however not fully evaluated on this non- contrast
study.

IMPRESSION:
1. Large consolidations seen at the lower lungs, right greater
than left, consistent with pneumonia. Associated pleural
effusions. No evidence of abscess.

2. New ground glass opacity and bronchiectasis at right upper
lobe. Patchy opacities seen at the upper lobes bilaterally.
Probably small loculated effusion on right.

3. 5mm nodular opacity seen in right lobe, possibly secondary to
infection.

Discussed with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 11182**] 9pm [**2108-5-27**].


Brief Hospital Course:
66 yo male with complicated medical hx, recent aspiration pna on
Oxacillin still with Subclavian line, from HRC with fever,
oxygen desaturation, and continued cough. Trasnferred to MICU
for hypoxia.
.
# PNA/Fever- patient has a h/o aspiration events (h/o
VRE/MRSA/pseudomonas). Sputum on last admission was growing
MSSA. Repeat CXR here was slightly better than on discharge. CT
scan showed extensive bilateral lower lobe consolidations. Given
that this likle represents a worsening of his previous PNA on
narrow coverage with oxacillin. Coverage broadened to vancomycin
and zosyin and he will compltete a 14 d course to end [**2108-6-9**].
Hypoxia improved with frequent chest PT and suctioning.
.
#Klebsiella UTI - On admission U/A. No symptoms but may explain
some of the admission fever. Should be covered by 14 day course
of zosyn. Repeat U/A should be done after abx to confirm cure.
.
# Bipolar disorder and Wilsons disease: continue on home meds
clonazepam, olanzapine, buproprion, lamotragine.
-- [**Hospital1 18**] does not carry trientine (copper chelator for
Wilson's). Substitute with zinc sulfate 220mg tid while in
house.

# Orthostatic hy
