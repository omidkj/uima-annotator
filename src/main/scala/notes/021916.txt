Postoperatively the patient did well and was transferred to
the Post Anesthesia Care Unit. An epidural was placed. The
patient had low blood pressure postoperatively and the
patient had hypovolemia and therefore the patient was started
on Neo-Synephrine for blood pressure support and a central
line was placed. The patient continued to have hypotension
and Levo was started and his blood pressure responded
accordingly. Fluid resuscitation continued and the patient
improved. From a pulmonary standpoint his chest tubes were
placed intraoperatively and those continued to put out decent
amounts and his lower and middle lobe re-expanded with
residual right upper lobe also re-expanding however, there
was small residual pneumothorax with hydropneumothorax
present. The patient continued to do well from the standpoint
of the pulmonary status and his chest tubes were slowly
removed after being clamped. The patient's chest tubes were
kept to water seal throughout his hospital course and then
they were clamped and removed sequentially. Chest x-ray
showed no change in the pneumothorax or the
hydropneumothorax.

The patient continued to do well and the Neo-Synephrine was
slowly weaned off. He was transfused one unit of packed red
blood cells for a crit of 28 for hypovolemic anemia. The
patient continued to do well and physical therapy was
consulted and the patient was able to ambulate and walk
around and it was decided that the patient could be
discharged home safely. The patient continued to do well, his
chest tube was removed on [**2159-7-30**] and it was decided
that the patient could be discharged home. The patient was
discharged in stable condition.
