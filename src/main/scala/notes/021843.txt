HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 69-year-old
male with a past medical history of hyperlipidemia,
hypertension, tobacco use, peripheral arterial disease
(status post left SFA stent), CRI, who presented for exercise
tolerance test today following several-month history of left
arm pain.  Of note, the patient had an abnormal stress test
in [**12-20**], which showed inferior ST-segment depressions on [**Initials (NamePattern4) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] protocol.  On the repeat exercise tolerance test, the
patient was noted to have marked ST-segment elevations in
segments II, III and aVF, as well as ST-segment depressions
in V2 to V6.  The patient reports that at the time of these
changes, he did experience substernal chest pain with
radiation to his left arm.  He, however, denies any nausea or
vomiting.  The test was discontinued and the patient's EKG
changes initially largely resolved.  The patient was given
aspirin, Toprol and 300 mg of Plavix and was referred to the
emergency department for further evaluation.  On the ED
admission, the EKG shows ST-segment elevations of 1 mm that
were upsloping in leads II, III and aVF as well as T-wave
inversions in aVL as well as Q-waves in II, III and F.  The
patient was started on heparin IV as well as Integrilin and
was taken to the cardiac catheterization lab for further
evaluation.

An echocardiogram in [**2170**] revealed an EF of 60 percent with
no wall motion abnormalities, normal chamber size and the
exercise tolerance test in [**12-20**], as mentioned in the HPI,
demonstrated inferior ST-segment depressions on [**Doctor First Name **]
protocol with maximum heart rate of 112 where he reached SVT
at 180.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient was recently widowed, lives with
his children, smokes currently one-half pack per day, but
used to smoke 2-3 packs per day.  Denies any significant
alcohol intake (states he has an occasional drink).  Works
currently, pushing carts at the Stop and Shop, though
formerly worked as a painter of both billboards and homes.
He denies any IVDA.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  The patient states that he has had
occasional chest pain, both at rest and with activity, that
the pain lasts up to 15 minutes and subsides spontaneously.
Some episodes have been associated with left arm discomfort.
Denies any PND, orthopnea or lower extremity edema.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Temperature is 97
degrees, blood pressure is 147/74, pulse is 59, respiratory
rate is 18, O2 saturation is 100 percent on 2 liters.  The
patient is found lying flat in bed in no acute distress.
Pupils equally round and reactive to light.  Extraocular
muscles intact.  Mucous membranes are moist.  JVP is
approximately 6 cm of water.  He has a regular rate and
rhythm, normal S1, S2, no murmurs, rubs or gallops.  His
chest is clear to auscultation bilaterally.  There is no
peripheral edema, no calf tenderness.  The patient has no
femoral bruit.  He has 2 plus pulses on the right PT, as well
as 1 plus on the right DP.  He has 1 plus pulses on the left.
Neurological examination:  Mental status exam is normal.
Cranial II-XII are intact.  He has 5 plus strength with a
normal cerebellar examination.

EKG ON ADMISSION:  As mentioned, normal sinus rhythm with ST-
segment to 1-mm elevations in II, III and F, Q-waves in II,
III and F, T-wave inversions in L.

LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION:  White count is 11.8,
hematocrit 39.2, platelets 156, sodium 141, potassium 4.4,
chloride 107, bicarbonate 27, BUN 23, creatinine 1.7, glucose
115, INR is 1.1, CK is 510 with an MB of 41, MB Index of 8
and troponin T of 3.25.

Chest film shows a bilateral pleural thickening with pleural
calcifications suggestive of asbestos exposure.  Also, there
is minimal right basilar opacification.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  CAD/ST-elevation MI:  The patient was taken
to cardiac catheterization.  Catheterization revealed a total
occlusion of the right coronary artery.  The LMCA, LAD and
LCX arteries are without significant obstructive disease.
The RCA has total 99 percent mid-vessel occlusion with
evidence of fresh thrombus.  The patient underwent placement
of 2 TAXUS drug-eluting stents in the right coronary artery
following successful Rheolytic thrombectomy.  The stents were
placed in the proximal/mid right coronary with overlapping
stents and there was no residual stenosis, no dissection and
there was TIMI-3 flow.  Hemodynamics revealed elevated right
filling pressures with diminished right systolic pressures.
Left heart filling pressures were elevated with a wedge of
20.  Cardiac output indices were 3.4 and 1.9 respectively.
The patient was maintained on aspirin, Plavix, as well as
Toprol 100 mg q.d. and lisinopril at his outpatient dose.
His Lipitor dose was subsequently increased to 80 mg q.d.
However, a lipid panel revealed a total cholesterol of 144
with an HDL of 40, and a LDL of 76.  Echocardiogram was
obtained the day following admission and revealed an ejection
fraction of greater than 55 percent with mild symmetric LVH
and mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction
including mild inferior hypokinesis.  There was also 1 plus
MR.  The patient's CK peak was 510 on admission, with peak CK-
MB of 41 on admission and a peak troponin T of 3.28.  The
patient was maintained on telemetry and did not have any
episodes of NSVT witnessed.

Chronic renal insufficiency:  The patient's creatinine on
admission was 1.7, which is similar to his baseline
creatinine.  His creatinine diminished to 1.5 at the time of
discharge.

Borderline diabetes mellitus:  The patient was noted on
several occasions to have elevated blood sugars.  His fasting
blood glucose ranged from 143 to 170.  A hemoglobin A1c was
sent and is pending at the time of this dictation.  The
patient will follow up with his primary care physician to
receive the result of the hemoglobin A1c test.  The
importance of dietary modification has been discussed with
the patient and it is possible that he may require oral
hypoglycemics for tighter glucose control.

Anemia:  The patient's hematocrit was stable and was 39 on
admission and 36.6 at the time of discharge.

COPD:  The patient was maintained on standing Atrovent as
well as p.r.n. albuterol.  The patient maintained adequate
room air oxygen saturations.

GERD:  The patient was maintained on pantoprazole.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  The patient is discharged in stable
condition.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:  ST-segment elevation myocardial
infarction (inferior).

Coronary artery disease.

Gastroesophageal reflux disease.

Anemia.

Chronic renal insufficiency.

Borderline diabetes mellitus.

Hypertension.

Hyperlipidemia.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
1. Aspirin 325, enteric-coated.
2. Plavix 75 mg q.d.
