Pertinent Results:
[**2180-8-28**] Echo: Pre-CPB: No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in
the left atrial appendage. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 40 - 45 %) with septal and
inferior and lateral hypokinesis. Right ventricle is mildly
hypokinetic. The entire length of ascending aorta is moderately
dilated, at 5.3 cm. Sino-tubular junction is intact.. The
descending thoracic aorta is mildly dilated. There are simple
atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is no aortic valve
stenosis. Moderate to severe (3+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate (2+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. Moderate [2+] tricuspid
regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial effusion.
Post-Bypass #1:
The patient has a tube graft of the ascending aorta. There is
moderate AI. After much discussion between surgeons, plan to
return to bypass and replace the aortic valve.
Post-CPB #2:
The patient is in SR, on low dose Epinephrine. LV is
underfilled. There is now a prosthetic aortic valve, well-seated
with no leak and no AI. Residual mean gradient = 5 mmHg. LV
systolic fxn remains mildly depressed.
RV systolic fxn is moderately depressed. MR is now 1+.
Descending aorta intact.

Final Report
REASON FOR EXAMINATION: Evaluation of the patient after aortic
valve
replacement and CABG.

AP and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in
comparison to [**9-2**], [**2180**].

Post-sternotomy wires are intact. The heart is enlarged. There
is potential
increase in left pleural effusion, moderate in size. Small
amount of right
pleural effusion is unchanged. No apparent pneumothorax is seen.
Mild
vascular engorgement is present but no overt edema is present.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 96228**] was a same day admit after undergoing pre-operative
work-up as an outpatient. On [**8-28**] she was brought directly to
the operating room where she underwent an ascending aorta
replacement, aortic valve replacement, and coronary artery
bypass graft x 1. A IABP was placed in the operating room as
well. Please see operative report for surgical details.
Following surgery she was transferred to the CVICU for invasive
monitoring in stable condition. Initially after surgery in the
OR and ICU she had episodes of atrial fibrillation and was
started on Amiodarone. Within 24 hours she was weaned from
sedation, awoke neurologically intact and extubated. IABP was
removed on post-op day two. She required aggressive pulmonary
diuresis and toilet for several days and remained in the CVICU
until post-op day seven due to her poor pulmonary status.
She was transferred to the floor and was aggressively diuresed
and weaned slowly down on oxygen.  She had a serratia UTI on
[**9-1**] and was treated with Cipro.  She continued to work with
physical therapy and was discharged to home on POD#9 with home
PT and home oxygen therapy in stable condition.
