Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3227**]
Chief Complaint:
"I fell"

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
emergent right craniotomy for SDH evacuation [**5-29**]

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 10653**] is a 62 year old man with type 1 diabetes
complicated by CKD V requiring hemodialysis who was brought to
the [**Hospital3 417**] Hospital ED yesterday after experiencing an
unwitnessed fall in his bathroom with head trauma and a hip
injury. At [**Hospital3 **], he was found to have a small right frontal
subdural hematoma as well as a fracture of his left femur, so he
was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management. He was admitted
to trauma surgery with neurosurg and ortho consults. A second
head CT showed stability of the subdural hematoma, so
neurosurgery signed off and recommended repeat CT in 4 weeks.
Ortho has been debating operative vs nonoperative management of
his femur fracture. He is transferred to medicine for management
of his BP and other medical issues.

CT Scan [**5-28**]:
NON-CONTRAST HEAD CT: There is a small right frontotemporal
subdural
hematoma, predominantly hyperdense. This measures maximally 8 mm
from the
inner table. There is no significant mass effect on the
underlying parenchyma, and no shift of normally midline
structures. There are no other foci of hemorrhage identified.
There is no edema. There is no evidence for acute large vascular
territory infarction.

Marked global parenchymal atrophy, indicated by prominence of
the sulci and ventricles, and periventricular white matter
hypodensity consistent with small vessel ischemic disease, is
unchanged from prior study in [**2205**]. Also redemonstrated are
dense calcifications of the intracranial carotid and vertebral
arteries. The osseous structures demonstrate no suspicious lytic
or sclerotic lesions. There is an air-fluid level seen in the
left maxillary sinus. The remainder of the paranasal sinuses and
mastoid air cells are normally pneumatized and clear.

IMPRESSION:
1. Small acute right frontotemporal subdural hematoma, unchanged
compared to appearance on CT performed at an outside hospital
earlier the same day. There is no significant mass effect, and
no shift of normally midline structures.
2. Unchanged global parenchymal atrophy, small vessel ischemic
disease, and dense intracranial vascular calcifications.

CT Scan [**5-29**] s/p dialysis
FINDINGS: There is a dramatic increase in the size of the right
frontal
subdural hematoma from 9 mm to 20 mm. There is associated new
significant
leftward subfalcine shift of 13 mm. There is effacement of the
right lateral ventricle and apparent obliteration of the
occipital [**Doctor Last Name 534**]. There is right uncal herniation. No
intraparenchymal bleed is seen. There is no fracture. Mastoid
air cells are clear. Visualized paranasal sinuses show an
air-fluid level in the left maxillary sinus.

IMPRESSION: Dramatic increase in size of right frontal subdural
hematoma with a new large 1.3 cm subfalcine herniation and uncal
herniation on the right.

CT [**5-30**]:
FINDINGS: There is subdural blood layering over the right
temporal lobe, as was seen on the pre-evacuation scan of 15:37.
This likely represents
redistribution and less likely new blood. There has been
improvement of the subfalcine herniation with structures now
being essentially midline. There is no intraparenchymal
hemorrhage. Streak artifact and intracranial air limits the scan
but [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter junction appears distinct. There is no
hydrocephalus. Ballooning of left occipital [**Doctor Last Name 534**] has decreased
and is stable secondary to decreased uncal herniation. Basal
cisterns are preserved. Again seen is fluid level within the
left maxillary sinus. Otherwise, paranasal sinuses and mastoid
air cells are clear. The carotid siphons are de
