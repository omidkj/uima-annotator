Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 425**]
Chief Complaint:
chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
cardiac catheterization


History of Present Illness:
Pt is 34 yo f w/ HTN who presented last PM to OSH with CP
radiating to back/arms. CP was sternal, burning, occurred at
rest, and radiated to back and both arms. Pain worsened with
exertion. The CP was associated with SOB, nausea, and dry
heaves. At the OSH, she had T-wave inversions in leads V1-V3,
with negative cardiac enzymes x 1, and was found to have K 2.5.
She received ASA and was placed on a nitro gtt. She reports
viral URI 1 wk ago. Pt was then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]. In the [**Name (NI) **],
pt had chest CTA, which was negative for PE or dissection. EKG
showed unchanged TWI (not dynamic). She ruled in for MI with
trop 0.51, CK 153, MB 20. She had a stat TTE, which showed
normal wall motion. She was placed on IV heparin and given
plavix 600mg. She had recurrent CP, and was re-started on nitro
gtt. She also was given potassium 40meq and Anzemet. Pt was then
taken to cardiac cath.
.
Pt now presents s/p cath, and denies CP/SOB. She c/o mild
headache and feeling "wiped out."

Pertinent Results:
REPORTS:
.
CTA CHEST W&W/O C&RECONS, NON-CORONARY  [**2102-3-22**] 7:54 AM:
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism or thoracic aortic
dissection.
2. 6-mm right thyroid nodule, further evaluation with ultrasound
is recommended.
3. Trace left pleural effusion. A reports place in the ED
dashboard at completion of examination.
.
Cardiac cath:
1. Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system
did not
reveal any significant disease. The LMCA, LAD, and RCA were all
widely
patent. The LCx had a smooth 60% lesion in the OM3 branch.
2. Limited resting hemodynamics revealed moderately elevated
left heart
filling pressures (LVEDP of 24mmHg) in the setting of systemic
arterial
hypertension with an aortic blood pressure of 180/114mmHg.
3. Left ventriculography revealed a calculated LVEF of 56% with
no
regional wall motion abnormalities. There was no mitral
regurgitation.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Coronary arteries are free of angiographically significant
disease.
2. Moderate diastolic left ventricular dysfunction.
.
[**2102-3-22**] TTE:
The left atrium is elongated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal.
Regional left
ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function  is normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve appears
structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is
a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. There is a small
anterior space which most likely represents a fat pad.
.
[**2102-3-25**] TTE:
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal
cavity size. There is mild regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction with focal severe hypokinesis of the mid/distal
inferolateral wall, though with preservation of the very distal
segment. The remaining segments also contract well. There is no
pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2102-3-22**], the
regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction is new and c/w
interim ischemia.
.
MRA KIDNEY W&W/O CONTRAST  [**2102-3-23**] 2:11 PM:
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of renal artery stenosis.
2. No evidence of retroperitoneal mass suspicious for
pheochromocytoma.
.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2102-3-24**] 10:15 AM
FINDINGS: There is no sign for the presence of an intracranial
hemorrhage, visible mass lesion, minor or major vascular
territorial infarction. The density values of the brain
parenchyma are normal. Surrounding osseous and soft tissue
structures are unremarkable, aside from rather bulbous
appearance of both internal auditory canals. This finding may
merely represent a congenital variant. However, if there is any
clinical suspicion for the possibility of bilateral
intracanalicular masses, which can be seen in the rather unusual
condition of neurofibromatosis II, supplemental MR scanning with
gadolinium enhancement of the internal auditory canals would be
helpful. There is slight prominence of the visualized posterior
superior nasopharyngeal soft tissues. This finding could be
within normal limits for a patient of this age.
