Labs on Discharge:

XXXXXXXXXX Imaging XXXXXXXXXX

Head CT([**9-19**])-Pre-op:
IMPRESSION: Large left subdural hematoma, likely hyperacute on
acute, with
associated rightward subfalcine herniation and uncal herniation.


CT C-Spine ([**9-19**]):
IMPRESSION:
1. No acute fracture or malalignment identified.
2. Multiple degenerative changes.

Head CT([**9-19**]): Post-op
There is a new approximately 3 x 3 cm left parieto-occipital
intraparenchymal hemorrhage. Expected post-surgical changes from
left
craniotomy with evacuation of subdural hematoma. The degree of
midline
shift and mass effect is markedly reduced. Subfalcine and uncal
herniation
has resolved.

gall bladder us: IMPRESSION: Prominent hepatic venous
vasculature suggestive of passive hepatic congestion.


Brief Hospital Course:
Patient is an 82 y/o M with history of atrial fibrillation and
[**Month/Year (2) 1291**] on coumadin, amiodarone, s/p Pacemaker, diastolic CHF,
admitted s/p fall with SDH. He was originally admitted to the
neurosurgery service and had an evacuation of Subdural
hemorrhage with a left sided craniotomy for bleed with
hernation. His post operative course was complicated by
diastolic CHG exacerbation and strep pneumonia VAP. He remained
unresponsive after the second intubation and was made CMO. he
was extubated [**10-3**] and passed away 2 hours later.
.
Respiratory Failure: intially intunated for neurosurgery
evacuation [**9-19**], extubated [**9-20**]. ReIntubated [**9-24**] after 1 day on
bipap for increased work of breathing and airway protection in
setting of pulmonary edema and pneumonia. Etiology of resp
failure is infections and cardiogenic. Patient was alkalotic, is
overbreathing the [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] decrease tidal volume. He was
treated with ceftriaxone for the strep pneumonia and despite
better volume status and treatment of PNA, he remained
unresponsive on no sedation. He failed several pressure support
trials secondary to hyperventilation and low tidal volumes, he
likely had neurogenic respiratory failure.

Subdural hemorrhage: s/p Craniotomy and evacuation [**9-19**], done
emergently. had unequal pupils [**2-24**] and had stat Head CT showing
no interval change. Pupils became equal again after several
days. He was started and continued on dilantin prophylaxis. The
dose was decreased given low albumin and corrected level higher
than measured. Despite Improving Dilantin level and correcting
hyponatremia, patient continued to have poor mental status.

Anemia: unclear etiology. Patient was hypercoaguable around the
time of fall. Not bleeding in brain, may have spontaneous RP
bleed. Hct went from 23 -> 20 hospital day 6, and responded to 2
units pRBCs. Patient also has underlying myeloid metaplasia. His
Hct did not drop after that.

[**Month/Year (2) 1291**]/Coagulpathy: patient with [**Month/Year (2) 1291**] with [**Hospital3 **] valve that
needs to be anticoagulated with INR goal [**2-6**]. Warfarin has been
held since admission and Pt recieved 3 units FFP on admission.
on [**9-25**] patient had INR 3.8 and recieved a total of 4 units FFP.
For several days, the INR remained >2 despite any
anticoagulation. When it fell below 2, coumadin 1mg was started.
Cardiology had been consulted by neurosurgery service, and the
decision was made to start coumadin without bolus when IRN <2
given the SDH on admisision. Possible etiologies of persistent
coagulopathy were vitamin K deficiency vs liver damage vs most
likely supratherapeutic phenytoin. When phenytoin values
normalized, INR also normalized.

Altered mental status: Patient unresponsive off sedation.
Etiology is likely multifactorial: subdural, hypernatremia,
uremia, and infection. Hypernatremia, uremia, infection were all
treated and he remained unresponsive.

Diastolic heart failure: EF >60% ([**3-12**]). Patient was on lasix
drip for a day, on intermittent lasix until euvolemic.

Transaminitis: unlikely from propofol as trigylcerides are
normal. Shock liver unlikely, has not been hypotensive. [**Month (only) 116**] be
septic.  eventually trended down.

CKD: baseline creatinine is 2.3-2.8. trended down and
normalized.
- renally dose meds

Hypertension: His blood pressure was eventually controlled on
the following regimen.
- Hydralazine titrated up to 37.5mg TID, Isosorbide mononitrate
increased from 10 to 20 PO BID, metoprolol 25mg [**Hospital1 **].

Atrial fibrillation: continue Amiodarone 200 [**Hospital1 **]

Hypothyroidism: home dose of 75mcg PO levothyroxine

HYperlipidemia: continue statin

Hypernatremia: has been trending up, likely contributing to
mental status
- free water boluses from 200q6 to 300q4.

BPH: held tamsulosin and finastride, not crushable via PEG

** Numerous family meeting were held, and given the lack of
improvement in his mental status in the setting of the large
subdural hematomas, the decision was made to transition the
patients care to comform measures. Family was brought in from
out of town, and the patient was extubated [**2135-10-3**]. He passed
away a few hours after extubation.
