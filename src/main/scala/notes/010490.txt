Service:  [**Hospital1 212**]

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 70 year old man
who was transferred to [**Hospital1 69**]
medical intensive care unit on [**2136-10-29**], with the
diagnoses of pancreatic pseudocyst and pancreatitis.  He was
transferred from [**Hospital3 417**] Hospital for further
evaluation and treatment at [**Hospital1 188**].  His current illness course dates back to [**2136-9-27**], when he was admitted to [**Hospital3 417**] Hospital for
acute on chronic pancreatitis.  His hospital course was
complicated by changes in mental status thought to be toxic
metabolic.  He also had aspiration pneumonia diagnosed on
chest x-ray and chest CT.  On [**2136-10-13**], he was
discharged from [**Hospital3 417**] to [**Hospital1 **] for
rehab.  He was placed on Levaquin at the time of discharge
from [**Hospital3 417**].  At rehab at [**Hospital1 **] he spiked
a temperature.  Urinalysis and culture revealed gram positive
cocci, methicillin resistant staph aureus and he was started
on vancomycin and his fever improved.  However, on [**10-28**]
he developed fever again and was transferred back to [**Hospital3 418**] and started on imipenem, Flagyl and vancomycin.

Reviewing his imaging history (all of the CT scans and
readings were performed at [**Hospital3 417**] Hospital), on
[**2136-9-28**] he had an abdominal and pelvic CAT scan with
contrast.  This revealed acute pancreatitis with modest
ascites, decreased enhancement of body of the pancreas
worrisome for pancreatic necrosis.  Also noted was a small
right pleural effusion.  On [**2136-10-1**] CT abdomen and pelvis
revealed acute pancreatitis, bilateral pleural effusions,
bilateral lung base consolidations.  On [**2136-10-5**] chest CT
with contrast showed bilateral effusions with pulmonary
consolidation likely aspiration of oral contrast.  On
[**2136-10-6**] CTA of the chest no evidence of pulmonary embolus.
Diffuse thickening of the distal esophagus, question of
esophagitis.  On [**2136-10-23**] chest CT decreased effusions in the
pleural space.  Scattered small nodular densities.  Also on
[**2136-10-23**] he had an abdominal CT which showed enlargement of
the pancreatic head with cystic transformation.  CT scan on
[**2136-10-28**] was an abdominal CT showing extensive pseudocyst in
the head measuring 6 x 7 cm and uncinate process which
measured 3 x 4 cm of the pancreas.  There was no free fluid
observed.

Given this history of possible pseudocyst, he was transferred
to [**Hospital1 69**] for further
evaluation of his fever and potential surgical drainage of a
pseudocyst.

numbness, weakness or tingling, abdominal pain.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 98.2, blood pressure
120/82, heart rate 88, respirations 20, saturation 93% in
room air.  In general, in no acute distress, alert and
oriented times two, not oriented to date, but oriented to
person and place.  HEENT: pupils equal, round and reactive to
light.  Extraocular motions intact.  Oropharynx clear.  Neck
supple, no nuchal rigidity, no lymphadenopathy.  Lungs clear
to auscultation bilaterally except for scattered bibasilar
rales.  Cardiovascular regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs,
gallops or rubs.  Abdomen soft, mildly distended, nontender,
active bowel sounds.  Extremities no cyanosis, clubbing or
edema.  Neurologically he had motor strength which was 4/5
times four extremities in both proximal and distal muscles.
Sensation to light touch was intact.  Cranial nerves II-XII
were intact.

LABORATORY DATA:  On transfer from the MICU to the medicine
floor white blood cell count 6.9, hematocrit 28.0, platelets
548.  Sodium 136, potassium 3.8, chloride 104, bicarb 22, BUN
11, creatinine 0.6, glucose 87.  Calcium 7.6, mag 2.4,
albumin 2.3, total bili 0.3, amylase 54, lipase 33, LDH 149,
AST 14, ALT 2, alka phos 52.  INR 1.2, PTT 26.1.  Urinalysis
revealed negative leukocyte esterase, negative nitrite, 6 red
blood cells, 12 white blood cells, 2 bacteria.  EKG normal
sinus rhythm, no acute ST-T wave changes.  Mild left axis
deviation with left atrial enlargement.  Initial portable
chest x-ray showed a left retrocardiac density.  Subsequent
Patient and lateral chest x-ray revealed continued
retrocardiac infiltrate and a possible small left sided
pleural effusion which likely represented either atelectasis,
pneumonia or resolution of previous aspiration pneumonia.
MRI of the brain showed no intracranial mass effect, no
evidence of infarction.  MRI of the thoracic, lumbar and
cervical spine revealed multilevel degenerative changes of
the lumbosacral spine with mild spinal canal stenosis at
L2-L3 and moderate spinal canal stenosis at L3-L4.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  Pancreatitis.  Upon arrival at the medical intensive care
unit from [**Hospital3 417**] Hospital, the patient has not
complained of any abdominal pain.  He has not shown any ill
effects from his current bout of pancreatitis.  His
pancreatic enzymes have all been within normal limits during
the course of his hospital stay.  These pancreatic enzymes
have been checked serially.  There is clearly evidence of
chronic pancreatitis on his previous CT scans, but there
appears to be no acute pancreatitis at present.  Patient's
pancreatitis was initially treated when he was made NPO and
given IV fluids for hydration.  Upon arrival to the medicine
floor on [**10-31**], he was started slowly on a clear liquid
diet.  He tolerated this very well, did not complain of
abdominal pain.  Pancreatic enzymes did not become elevated
after starting this diet and he has done very well since
starting his diet and has slowly advanced to a full diet.

2.  Pancreatic pseudocyst.  Regarding the pseudocyst, the
hepatobiliary service was consulted to evaluate patient for
his pseudocyst.  Their initial evaluation and evaluation
throughout his hospital course do not indicate any need for
surgical intervention or drainage at this point.  The
pseudocyst has been stable since arrival at [**Hospital1 346**].

3.  Neuro.  The patient carried a preliminary diagnosis of
Parkinson disease and had apparently been started on both
Sinemet and Requip at some point prior to his admission.  His
wife also informed us that he had seen multiple neurologists
and had been evaluated.  We asked the neurology consult
service to see patient regarding the diagnosis of Parkinson
disease and evaluate for any over-medication.  After their
evaluation, they suggested an MRI of the brain and spine to
evaluate for any compression that could possibly be
explaining his weakness.  The MR of his brain was normal.
The MR of his spine did show some spinal canal stenosis which
could be consistent with his weakness in an upper motor
neuron pattern in the lower extremities.  We also checked a
CK as a possible explanation for his weakness.  This came
back at 11.

4.  Infectious disease.  The patient came to the hospital on
imipenem.  He was continued on imipenem for a five day
course.  His white count has remained stable and low
throughout his hospital stay.  He has been afebrile since
arriving at this facility and there is no indication that
there is active infection.  He will be discharged on no
antibiotics.

5.  Endocrine.  The patient has a history of diabetes
mellitus.  He has been maintained on sliding scale insulin
and has required very little in
