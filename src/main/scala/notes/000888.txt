Imaging:
IMPRESSION:
5/6/10CT Chest & Abdomen
1. Pulmonary emboli within the right upper lobe segmental and
subsegmental  pulmonary arteries, as well as the right
interlobar pulmonary artery, and  segmental right lower lobe
pulmonary artery without evidence of right heart strain.
2. Unchanged bilateral ground-glass opacities most pronounced in
the upper lobes consistent with patient's history of cryptogenic
organizing pneumonia.
3. Superior endplate compression fracture of L2, new compared to
[**2136-5-5**]. New acute and subacute bilateral rib fractures.


Brief Hospital Course:
He was admitted to the Trauma Service for pulmonary care; pain
management and anticoagulation for his multiple pulmonary
emboli. He was immediately bolused and started on a Heparin
drip. His Coumadin was started on [**6-9**] at 5 mg and increased to
7.5 mg due to sub therapeutic INR; his last INR on [**6-13**] was 1.5.
Once INR goal range of [**3-7**] reached his Heparin drip can be
stopped.

Mr. [**Known lastname 20400**] has a long history with chronic pain requiring long
and short acting narcotics at home to manage this. With his rib
fractures his pain was very difficult to manage and the decision
was made to consult with the Pain Service. Both his long and
short acting medications were increased; it was noted however
that the Oxycodone increased breakthrough dose was not offering
much relief for his rib fracture pain. He had been receiving
intermittent IV Dilaudid for severe breakthrough pain and this
was stopped and he was changed to oral Dilaudid. It should be
noted that he is requiring larger than usual doses of this
medication 12-14 mg every 3-4 hours prn. His adjunct
medications, Neurontin and Topamax were increased. Tizanidine
was added as well. He is on an aggressive bowel regimen.

He was also evaluated by the Orthopedic Spine surgery service
for the L2 compression fracture; there was no operative
intervention indicated. Activity as tolerated was recommended.

His oxygen saturations have ranged in the low 90's and he has
made very slow progress with Physical therapy who are
recommending acute rehab after his hospital stay. He requires
frequent monitoring of his oxygen saturations and respiratory
status in general.
