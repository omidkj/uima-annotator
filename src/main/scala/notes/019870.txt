Chief Complaint:
Transfer [**Hospital1 100**] MACU for hemodialysis line replacement for
poorly functioning catheter

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:

s/p a new tunnelled hemodialysis line placement


History of Present Illness:
71yo F with ESRD on HD, respiratory failure s/p trach on vent,
s/p PEG, COPD, recurrent aspiration PNA, and C.diff colitis is
transferred from [**Hospital 100**] Rehab MACU for poorly functioning HD
catheter and thus HD catheter change. She tolerated HD today
well at [**Hospital 100**] rehab and removed 1.7kg. She has multiple medical
problems as above, but all has been stable.

For respiratory failure, she is on pressure support and has had
30 minutes trial of trach mask this past weekend which was
stopped due to hypoxia. Rehab has been slowing weaning her from
the vent. Pt is on PS 4/5/50%.
.
For PVD, pt has necrotic, dry gangrene that is auto-amputating.
Getting pain meds/prn and lidoderm patch.
.
For AF, pt is on digoxin. Last level checked on [**12-12**] was 0.8. Pt
is not anticoagulated.

IR REPORT:
RADIOLOGISTS: The procedure was performed by Drs. [**Last Name (STitle) 9441**] and
[**Name5 (PTitle) 2492**], the attending radiologist who was present and
supervising throughout.
PROCEDURE AND FINDINGS: After informed consent was obtained, the
patient was placed supine on the angiography table and the right
neck and chest were prepped and draped in the standard sterile
fashion. After using approximately 10 cc of 1% lidocaine along
the subcutaneous tract of the previously placed hemodialysis
catheter, blunt dissection was performed until the cuff of the
catheter was completely exposed. Then two super stiff glide
wires were advanced through each one of the two lumens of the
previously placed catheter into the inferior vena cava and right
atrium under fluoroscopic guidance. The previously placed
catheter was then removed and a new double-lumen hemodialysis
catheter was advanced over both wires and the tip was positioned
into the right atrium under fluoroscopic guidance. The wires
were removed, the entry site on the skin was sutured with Vicryl
suture, and the catheter was secured to the skin with 2-0 silk
sutures. Catheter was then flushed, hep locked and a sterile
dressing was applied. The patient tolerated the procedure well
without immediate complications.
Moderate sedation was provided by administering divided doses of
75 mcg of fentanyl and 1 mg of versed throughout the total intra
service time of 55 minutes during which the patient's
hemodynamic parameters were continuously monitored.
IMPRESSION: Successful replacement of a double-lumen
hemodialysis catheter. Final fluoroscopic image of the chest
demonstrates the tip of the catheter to be located in the right
atrium approximately 2.0 cm below the tip of the previously
placed catheter. The line is ready for use.


Brief Hospital Course:
71yo F with multiple chronic medical problems but stable
admitted for a new HD catheter placement.  Brief hospital
course:
.
# ESRD: Pt was admitted in a very stable condition.  She
underwent HD with 1.7kg fluid removal at rehab prior to arrival
to MICU. Her 'lytes were all wnl.  She was continued on her
tums.  She was also given mucomyst per son's (HCP) request to
preserve any remaining renal function she has.  She was also
written for prn dilaudid for feet pain she has during HD after
fluid/electrolytes shift.  The malfuncting RSC tunnelled line
was removed and a new tunnelled line was placed by IR on
[**2187-12-18**].  She received 1h HD on [**12-18**] to confirm that it is
functioning.  She then received a more complete round of HD on
[**12-19**] prior to transfer back to MACU.
.
# Anemia: hct was 33.3 at admission which is stable. Epogen can
be continued during HD.   She had hematoma and bleeding at site
of HD line after the procedure.  Pressure was applied and it
stabilized.  Her HCT was followed serially and remained stable.
She was hemodynamically stable.
.
# Respiratory failure s/p trach: Pt is being followed closely by
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]. Vent satting at [**Hospital **] rehab is PS 4/5/50%, rr25-30,
Vt350-402 satting 93-95%. Pt was placed on PS 5/5/50% and O2 sat
was in 93-95%.  Trach collar trial can be restarted at the
rehab.  Her COPD inhalers were continued.
- Continue pressure support
- trach collar trial as tolerated
- continue nebs for COPD
.
# C.diff colitis: continued PO vanc but [**Hospital1 18**] does not have
lactobacillus, so it was not given. Lactobacillus can be
continued at rehab.
.
# Hypothyroidism: Continued synthroid
.
# Atrial Fibrillation: Pt was in sinus rhythm.  We continued
digoxin every other day, recent digoxin level was 0.8 at the
rehab.  Pt was not started on anticoagulation as she was not on
it as outpatient.
.
# PVD: Followed by vascular surgery at rehab. dry gangrene of
toes and auto-amputating.  Continued wound care with betadine
and dry dressing and lidoderm patch on the feet and
oxycodone/prn for pain control.
.
# Decub ulcer: Followed by wound care team at rehab. Frequent
turns and [**Doctor First Name **] air bed.
.
# Pruritis: [**3-9**] previous fentanyl. Continued benadryl/prn
.
# FEN: Continued g-tube feeding with Nepro at 35cc/hr with [**Hospital1 **]
Prostat.

regimen given c.diff diarrhea.
.
# DNR per rehab d/c summary, confirmed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 67217**]/HCP at
rehab
.
# Dispo: back to MACU
