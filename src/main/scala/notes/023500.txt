History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 14748**] is a 65 y/o man with PMH of DM2, hypertension, and
ESRD s/p renal transplant in [**2185-2-12**] who presented with chest
pain and dizziness. The patient went to the transplant clinic
for staple removal earlier today; he states that on his way
home, he noted several episodes of "almost passing out" which he
cannot describe further. States he had to "shake himself" to
"wake up." In that setting he says he realized that "something
wasn't right." He arrived home and took a sublingual
nitroglycerin which relieved his symptoms. He then contact[**Name (NI) **] the
transplant clinic where he was directed to return to the ED. He
also took a 325 mg aspirin prior to leaving the house. Of note,
the patient experienced a perioperative myocardial infarction
and also was noted to have elevation in cardiac enzymes in
setting of acute hypoxic event during recent admission [**2185-3-23**] -
[**2185-3-27**]. He declined treatment with heparin at that time but was
evaluated by the Cardiology consult team. He has an upcoming
appointment with outpatient Cardiology (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] at [**Hospital1 18**]
later this week. Echocardiogram during admission for transplant
([**3-7**]) showed EF 45-50% with inferior and inferolateral
hypokinesis. Initial vitals in the ED were T 97.8, HR 59, BP
121/58, RR 16, O2 100% on 4L NC. In the ED, he complained of
slight ongoing chest pressure and was treated with sublingual
nitroglycerin X 1 and morphine 2 mg IV X 1, and the chest pain
resolved. Patient's troponin found to be elevated at 9, so was
started on heparin gtt without bolus after discussion with
Cardiology fellow. He was noted to be guaiac negative prior to
initiation of heparin.

1. Coronary angiography of this right dominant system
demonstrated 3
vessel coronary artery disease.  The LMCA had an eccentric
ostial 40%
stenosis.  The LAD was heavily calcified with diffuse disease in
the
proximal segment to a 30% stenosis.  The mid-LAD had a 60%
stenosis
between D1 and D2.  The bifurcating D1 had a proximal 50%
stenosis.  The
large D2 had an origin 80% stenosis.  There were septal
collaterals to
the RCA.  The LCx had mild diffuse plaquing proximally to
30-40%.  There
was a 70% bifurcating stenosis involving 2 major limbs of the
OM2.  The
distal AV groove LCx had collaterals to the RCA.  The RCA had a
proximal
occlusion within the Gianturco-Roubin stent with faint distal
filling
via vasa and right-to-right collaterals.
2. Limited resting hemodynamics revealed elevated left sided
filling
pressure with a LVEDP of 22 mmHg.  Systemic arterial pressure
was normal
at 131/46 mmHg.  There was no transaortic valve gradient on

the catheter from the LV to the aorta.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 14748**] was admitted under cardiology after ruling in for a
myocardial infarction. Troponins were elevated while CK and CKMB
remained flat. He remained stable on intravenous Heparin.
Hemodialysis was continued per schedule. It was decided to
proceed with cardiac catheterization on [**3-31**] which
revealed severe three vessel coronary artery disease and
moderate left ventricular diastolic dysfunction - see result
section for further details. Cardiac surgery was therefore
consulted and additional workup was performed. Preoperative
evaluation was notable for mild to moderate disease of the
internal carotid arteries. In preparation for cardiac surgical
intervention, Plavix was discontinued. Workup was otherwise
unremarkable and he was cleared for surgery.

On [**4-5**], Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] performed coronary artery bypass
grafting. For surgical details, please see separate dictated
operative note. Following the operation, he was brought to the
CVICU for invasive monitoring. Within 24 hours, he awoke
neurologically intact and was extubated without incident. He
maintained stable hemodynamics and transferred to the SDU on
postoperative day one. He was followed closely by the renal
service and continued on hemodialysis throughout post-op course.
Chest tubes were removed on post-op day two and epicardial
pacing wires on post-op day three. Antibiotics were started for
UTI on post-op day three. But since yeast was grown in urine
culture, Fluconazole was started and he will needs a 14 day
course. He worked with physical therapy during post-op course
for strength and mobility. Over next several days he continued
to slowly recover receiving blood transfusions with dialysis and
remained anuric. On [**4-12**] he underwent a renal biopsy which is
initially negative for rejection.

He was ready for discharge home on
