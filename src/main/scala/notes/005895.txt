Chief Complaint:
SOB/hypoxia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
[**Hospital Unit Name 20719**] NOTE:
PCP: [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 3029**]
CC: SOB, hypoxia
.
HPI: Ms. [**Known lastname 15427**] is a 69 yo F with h/o COPD (4L NC at home at
baseline; frequent admissions for exacerbations) and s/p small
cell lung CA with post-XRT fibrosis of the right lung.  She
presented to the ED this morning c/o 2-3 days of SOB, especially
at night when she was sleeping.  She has also had worsening of
sputum production in the last day with change in color to green
as well as decreased ability to cough up secretions.  She denied
fevers at home.
.
In the ED, VS were T 98.9, HR 73, BP 107/72, RR 20, 93% 6L.  She
was started on CPAP with sats in the upper 90's, but she then
refused to continue wearing the mask.  Chest x-ray did not show
an infiltrate.  No studies were ordered to rule out PE because
the ED felt this was low probability in the setting of an INR
2.0.  She was given solumedrol 125 mg IV,
[**Known lastname **]/ceftriaxone, and albuterol nebulizers.

ADMISSION PHYSICAL EXAM:
VS in the ED: T 98.9, HR 73, BP 107/72, RR 20, 93% 6L
GENERAL: elderly appearing, frail; very vocal about her
discomfort & frustration with being in the ICU; speaking in full
sentences
SKIN: No rashes; scattered ecchymoses on hands
HEENT: JVD to midneck, neck supple.
CHEST: decreased BS on right; crackles at right base; minimal
wheezing throughout; minimal accessry muscle use.
CARDIAC: Regular rhythm; no murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
ABDOMEN: + Ostomy, overall NT/ND
EXTREMITIES:1+ LE edema, warm without cyanosis
NEUROLOGIC: AA, Ox3; CN II - XII in tact; moving all
extremities.
.
LABS: see below; notable for WBC 11.5, 94% PMN's, 0 bands; INR
2.0; Na 128
.
MICROBIOLOGY: 2 sets of BCx sent from ED; pending
.
IMAGING:
[**2167-5-25**] ADMISSION CXR:
FINDINGS: The extensive post-treatment changes (post-surgery and
radiation) involving the right lung are similar. There is
significant radiation fibrosis at the right lung base with
persistent right pleural effusion and atelectasis. The known
spiculated right upper lobe nodule is not well seen on today's
radiograph. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is similar. The
cerclage wires and surgical clips are unchanged. The bones are
unremarkable.
IMPRESSION: Post-surgical and radiation changes in the right
lung are stable.  No evidence of pneumonia.
.
[**6-/2166**] SPIROMETRY (most recent):
FEV1 0.56 (29% predicted); FVC 1.12 (41% predicted)
.
[**11/2166**] ECHO (most recent):
The left atrium is elongated. The right atrium is moderately
dilated. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global
systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%) There is no ventricular
septal defect. The right ventricular cavity is markedly dilated
with severe global free wall hypokinesis. There is abnormal
septal motion/position consistent with right ventricular
pressure/volume overload. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic
regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild to moderate ([**11-26**]+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are
moderately thickened. Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid
regurgitation is seen. There is severe pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial
effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2164-9-20**],
the RV has further dilated and systolic function has
deteriorated. The estimated PASP has increased. The LVEF remains
normal.
.
.
.
ASSESSMENT/PLAN:
69 yo F w/ multiple medical problems including severe COPD,
right-sided pulm fibrosis, and atrial fibrillation, presenting
with SOB x 2-3 days in setting of increased (green) sputum
production.
.
#. SOB: unclear whether bronchitis-driven COPD exacerbation vs.
cardiac/pulmonary edema. CXR not especially concerning for
volume overload and patient with EF 55% on recent echo in
[**11/2166**]; however, history of worsening SOB with recumbency is c/f
cardiac source.  Patient refusing additional lasix PO tonight
given she does not have a foley and does not want to be up all
night.  Decreased CO in setting of poorly controlled AFib less
likely given that her HR not elevated on admission.  Said she
feels better after "treatments" in the ED; on 4 - 6 L NC now,
speaking in full sentences with minimal accessory muscle use.
-- albuterol and combivent nebs standing overnight; will change
to PRN in the am if stable
-- received solumedrol 125 mg IV in the ED; will continue
prednisone 30 mg QD with taper beginning in next 1 - 2 days
pending stability
-- will wean to 4L NC (home baseline) as tolerated; no need for
CPAP currently.
-- will continue [**Year (4 digits) **] x 4 days.
-- continue home dose lasix 80 mg QD; will consider additional
dose if with continued O2 requirement > 4LNC in am or volume
overloaded on exam.
.
#. ATRIAL FIBRILLATION: rate well controlled currently
-- will cont home regimen of digxoin and sotalol
-- INR 2.0 --> will continue coumadin 3 mg QD; recheck INR in am
.
#. PULMONARY HYPERTENSION:
-- will continue sildenafil 50 mg Q8 hours
.
#. CHRONIC BACK PAIN: [**Last Name 20720**] problem in [**Name (NI) **]; on Tylenol
#3 at home
-- continue home regimen
.
#. PPX:
-- bowel regimen
-- will hold on protonix given low risk for stress ulcers (not
acutely ill currently) and eating a regular diet
-- will consider starting pneumoboots or SQH in am pending
patient agrees
.
#. FEN: no evidence of dehydration; will place on regular diet
.
#. CODE: full
.
#. DISPO: to remain in ICU overnight for observation and further
treatment; will likely transfer to floor in am
