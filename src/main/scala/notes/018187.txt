Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1711**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac catherization and stent placement

History of Present Illness:
This is a 65 yoM w/h/o CAD s/p BMS to LAD and LCS on [**2110-2-17**]
discharged on [**2110-2-19**] home and represents w/SOB and CP this AM.
Pt notes that he had had fatigue but was otherwise feeling well
since his discharge w/o any SOB or CP. However, this AM, after
his shower this AM, he had SOB, nausea, emesis x 2 w/gradual
onset of CP that persisted >1hour. He describes CP as substernal
w/o radiation same as the pain he had on [**2-17**] when he received
his first BMS; this is his first episode since prior
presentation. He took two [**Month/Year (2) **] w/o improvement, his daughter
called EMS and he was brought in to the ED. EMS strips showed ST
elevations in V2-V5.
.
Upon arrival, he was noted to have [**3-6**] cp and V2-V5 ST
elevations no EKG; code stemi was initiated and pt went to cath
lab where he had LAD clot lysis and a stent placed distal to his
original stent.
.
Of note, he and his daughter report that they did not pick up
his new discharge cardiac medications and the only meds he has
been taking is a baby [**Month/Year (2) **], and his psych meds.
.
On review of symptoms, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
He denies exertional buttock or calf pain. He denies sx of
recent depression/anxiety; no thoughts of harming himself or SI.
All of the other review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of prior chest
pain, dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea,
orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

Pertinent Results:
Cardiac cath [**2110-2-26**]
COMMENTS:
1. Selective coronary angiography of the LMCA, LAD and LCX
revealed
totally occluded LAD at mid segment with abundant thrombus
burden
therafter.  The LCX had slow flow but otehrwise was patent. The
RCA was
not engaged.
2. Limited resting hemodynamic assessment revealed systemic
arterial
hypertension (143/104 mmHg).
3. Left ventriculography was deferred.
4. Successful PCI/stent to stent thrombosis of mid LAD with a
3.0x12mm
Vision stent deployed to 15atms. The stents were postdilated to
3.25mm
at 14 atms. Excellent result with normal flow down vessel and no

residual stenosis.

TTE [**2110-2-27**]
The left atrium is moderately dilated. There is moderate
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular
cavity size is normal. There is severe regional left ventricular
systolic dysfunction with akinesis of the mid-distal septum,
anterior wall and the entire distal one-third of the left
ventricle, as well as mild hypokinesis of the basal inferior
wall (EF 25-30%), c/w multivessel CAD. No masses or thrombi are
seen in the left ventricle. Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a
normal left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
number of aortic valve leaflets cannot be determined. There is
no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is a trivial/physiologic
pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Severe gional left ventricular systolic dysfunction,
c/w CAD.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2110-2-18**],
regional LV wall motion abnormalities in the distribution of the
LAD are new.

FEMORAL VASCULAR US RIGHT  [**2110-3-2**] 9:27 PM
RIGHT GROIN ULTRASOUND: There is a 2.7 x 2.6 x 1.6 cm ovoid
hypoechoic structure adjacent and superficial to the right
common femoral artery, which appears to be connected to the
artery with a short neck. No definite flow is demonstrable
within the structure, although there does appear to be some
arterial flow within the neck. The common femoral arterial
waveform is normal. The common femoral venous waveform is
normal.

IMPRESSION: Findings are most suggestive of a thrombosed
pseudoaneurysm arising from the right common femoral artery.
Flow detectable only within the neck of the pseudoaneurysm.
