Discharge labs:

Imaging:
[**2176-10-9**] CXR: No acute intrathoracic process.

[**2176-10-10**] IR Guided PICC Placement:
Successful PICC exchange, with placement of a new 36 cm
double-lumen PowerPICC. The tip is within the distal SVC. The
line is ready to use.

[**2176-10-14**] CXR:
In comparison to prior radiograph, a new right-sided PICC
terminates in the mid SVC.  Left lower lobe opacities could
represent aspiration versus pneumonia.  The right lung is
grossly clear.  Extensive vascular clips are noted.  Cardiac
size is normal without any signs of heart failure.


Brief Hospital Course:
[**Age over 90 **]-year-old female with advanced Alzheimer's dementia who
presented to the ED with altered mental status and hypotension,
found to have a leukocytosis, positive UA, hypernatremia to 171,
and ARF.

# Sepsis: Pt. met [**3-2**] SIRS criteria (WBC 14.7 and HR 100) and
has evidence of infection, likely urinary source, based on UA
with positive LE, >182 WBCs, and many bacteria. Initially
presented with hypotension 88/61, which improved with 2L NS.
Lactate on presentation was 3.0.  At the MICU, she was started
on vancomycin and cefepime while awaiting urine culture results.
 She was also on levophed to maintain MAP > 65.  With treatment
of her infection and with IVFs (see below), she was able to be
weaned off the pressor and was transferred to the medical floor.


# Hypernatremia: Pt presented with Na of 171.  Her family
endorsed that she had been refusing food and drink for several
days.  This degree of hypernatremia most likely represents a
significant free water deficit caused either by decreased PO
intake of free water, or increased urinary losses, i.e. diabetes
insipidis. Calculated free water deficit was 6.2L on admission.
We must assume this hypernatremia has been present for at least
24 hours, and therefore we corrected her serum Na at a rate no
greater than 10mEq per day in order to avoid iatrogenic cerebral
edema. Renal consult was obtained and with their guidance,
patient was placed on IVFs that were adjusted based on her rate
of correction.  She was initially on 1/2NS, then D5W and NS and
briefly on hypertonic saline to prevent overcorrection.
Electrolytes were monitored every 2 hours initially and spaced
out as electrolytes normalized.  Sodium level eventually
normalized to the low 140 range and she was maintained on D5 [**1-29**]
normal saline as she was taking PO.

# Altered mental status:  Caretaker reported that she was less
responsive than baseline.  Likely multifactorial. Primary
contributor is likely her profound hypernatremia. This may be
exacerbated by underlying UTI/sepsis as well as baseline severe
dementia.  She was continued on memantine and mirtazapine.

# [**Last Name (un) **]: Pt.'s severe hypernatremia and evidence of volume
depletion on exam argue strongly for a pre-renal etiology. Cr
returned to baseline with IVFs.

# UTI: Patient with evidence of UTI on urinalysis, but culture
was without growth.  She was initially started on vanco/cefepime
given likely sepsis (
