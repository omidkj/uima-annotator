Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 158**]
Chief Complaint:
Lower gastrointestinal bleed


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2154-12-12**]: ex-lap and sigmoid colectomy

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 109648**] is a 76M with history of atrial fibrillation on
warfarin, diverticulosis, hemorrhoids, and multiple episodes of
LGIB who presented with BRBPR. Patient was at home the morning
of admission, when he had a large bloody bowel movement. Per
report, was mostly bright red blood with minimmal amount of
stool. Patient then had 3 subsequent episodes of smaller, bloody
bowel movements. He called PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 1023**] referred him to the ED for
further evaluation.

On arrival to ED he was afebrile, HR 60, BP 140/11, and he was
satting 98% on 4L. On rectal exam, he was found to have frank
blood in the vault. Labs were notable for Hct 42 (stable), and
elevated Cr 1.5 (baseline 1-1.2). ECG did not show any changes
concerning for ischemia. He had another large, bloody bowel
movement in ED prior to transfer to the floor. On arrival to the
floor he remained hemodynamically stable, and had been weaned
off oxygen to room air. He denied any abdominal pain, nausea,
vomiting, or hematemesis, but continued to have multiple large
bowel movements that were bloody.

He was subsequently transferred to the MICU for active GIB based
on prelim CTA showing intraluminal hemorrhage in the proximal
sigmoid colon in the arterial phase with pooling in the delayed
phase images, consistent with active bleeding. He had received 3
units of pRBC and 3 units of FFP on the floor. He received an
additional 3 units of pRBC and 2 unit of FFP on the floor in
addition to a bag of platelets. He has in total received 6 units
of pRBC, 2 units of FFP, and one bag of platelets. He was also
given calcium gluconate 2 gm IV x 1. On admission to the ICU, he
had a large (250 cc) bloody bowel mvoement. He was taken to IR.
He was found to have active bleeding from the branch of the [**Female First Name (un) 899**]
bleeding into the sigmoid colon. However after 2 hours,
selective embolization was not able to be performed. Radiation
and contrast limits had been reached. The patient remained
hemodynamically stable but was continuing to have active
bleeding. Surgery consultation suggested that he go to the OR
for ex-lap and urgent sigmoid colectomy.

Of note, the patient was feeling in his otherwise normal state
of health. He denies any symptoms except malaise and "dizzy" at
time in addition to the BRBPR.

He was also recently hospitalized from [**2154-11-19**] to [**2154-11-22**] with
a diastolic congestive heart failure exacerbation attributed to
atrial fibrillation with RVR and dietary indiscretion. At that
time, he was cardioverted into NSR followed by chemical rhythm
control with amiodarone. He has remained in NSR. His weight on
discharge was 119 kg (262 lbs). His weight on current admission
was 252.60 lbs.
