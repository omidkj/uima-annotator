Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1515**]
Chief Complaint:
Elective admit for septal ethanol ablation for HOCM

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Septal ablation
Temporary pacing wire placement


History of Present Illness:
50M with a history hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy,
single vessel CAD, HLD, and a family history of early CAD who
presents for elective etOH septal ablation. He reports that
starting [**4-/2121**], he has had chest "tightness" and shortness of
breath with low level of activity including walking at a fast
pace. The symptoms are allieviated by rest. He reports that
prior to [**Month (only) **], he has never had similar symptoms. Though he has
had some presyncope since the onset of symptoms, he denies
history of syncope. He reports normal exercise tolerance in his
youth. He was seen Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] who started verapamil CR 240mg and
metoprolol 12.5mg, without any change in his symptoms. He went
for a cardiac cath which showed enlargment of the
intraventricular septum consistent with Hypertrophic Obstructive
Cardiomyopathy. He was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] this evening after
undergoing elective alcohol septal ablation without
complication.
.
On arrival to the CCU, his vitals were T:97.0 bp158/107 p75 rr18
98%, he complained of [**4-19**] chest pain, EKG showed NSR @80 with Q
waves in II, III and aVL and J-point elevation in V4-5. Compared
with [**2121-8-8**] tracing, the Q waves appear deeper, otherwise the
EKG is unchanged. He was treated with 4x morphine 2mg IV and
metoprolol 10mg IV with resolution of his symptoms.
.
On review of systems, he reports long standing back pain, denies
history of CAD, prior MI. Denies recent fever/chills, syncope,
myalgias, joint pains, cough. All of the other review of systems
were negative.
.

Past Medical History:
1. CARDIAC RISK FACTORS: + Dyslipidemia
2. CARDIAC HISTORY:
- HOCM: Echo in [**5-19**] mid-systolic gradient of 59 mmHg at rest
and 78 mmHg during valsalva. Started on beta-blockers at that
time. Repeat echo in [**6-19**] with mid-systolic gradient of 18 mmHG
at rest and 62 mmHg during Valsalva. Underwent etOH septal
ablation on [**2121-12-12**].
- PERCUTANEOUS CORONARY INTERVENTIONS: [**2121-8-8**] Right dominant
system. The LAD had a 40% stenosis in the mid-portion. Resting
hemodynamics revealed slightly elevated right and left sided
filling pressures with RVEDP of 10 mmHg and LVEDP of 28. The
PASP was 25 mmHg. There was no gradient present at rest. With
provocation (1.post-PVC 2. valsalva 3. nitroglycerin 200 mcg
bolus), the gradient increased to 80-90 mmHg.

.
Cardiac Cath:
Initial left coronary angiogram showed 30% diffuse disease in
mid LAD.
Second septal S2 was largest of all septal branches. LCX was
normal.
Right coronary angiogram was not performed (normal on prior
cath).

Baseline resting LVOT gradient was normal. With dobutamine
infusion at 5
mcg/kg/min the gradient increased to > 100 mm Hg.

Selective ablation of the medial subbranch of the S2 under
fluoro and
echo guidance (definity), with 1 CC Ethanol injection did not
result in
improvement of LVOT gradient on echo.

Selective ablation through the main S2 branch with 1.5 cc of
Ethanol
injection resulted in significant improvement of LVOT gradient
to less
than 20 mm Hg with dobutamine infusion.

Final angiogram showed normal flow in the LAD and ablated flow
in the
S2.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1- Hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy
2- Successful Ethanol septal ablation
3. Medical Rx, increase Verapamil dose.
4. Monitor in CCU for 48 hours with serial cardiac enzymes and
temporary
pacemaker support.
.
Pre Echo:
    Left Ventricle - Ejection Fraction:  	>= 55% 	>= 55%
    Left Ventricle - Peak Inducible LVOT gradient: 	120 mm Hg 	
Findings
Intravenous administration of echo contrast was used due to poor
native endocardial border definition.
LEFT VENTRICLE: Asymmetric LVH. Normal regional LV systolic
function. Overall normal LVEF (>55%). Severe resting LVOT
gradient.
MITRAL VALVE: Trivial MR.
PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.
Conclusions:
There is asymmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. Regional left
ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). With infusion of
dobutamine at 5 mcd/kg/min, there is a severe resting left
ventricular outflow tract obstruction (120 mmHg). Trivial mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial effusion.
Infusion of echocontrast into the first and second branches of
the second septal perforator demonstrates focal opacification of
the hypertrophied basal septum, without extension into the
moderator band.
IMPRESSION: Severe inducible LVOT obstruction. Favorable anatomy
for ethanol septal ablation.
.
Post Echo:
    Left Ventricle - Ejection Fraction:  	>= 55% 	>= 55%
    Left Ventricle - Peak Inducible LVOT gradient: 	24 mm Hg 	
Findings
LEFT VENTRICLE: Mild resting LVOT gradient.
RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.
Conclusions:
There is a mild resting left ventricular outflow tract
obstruction. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Following infusion of ethanol, there is minimal
residual outflow tract obstruction (24 mmHg). No VSD seen.

Brief Hospital Course:
50 yoM with symptomatic Hypertrophic Obstructive Cardiomyopathy
s/p ablation with chest pain related to ablation.
