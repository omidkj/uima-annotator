HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 65-year-old
man who was driving in his car when he hit a tree head-on.

accident because a witness reported that the patient's eyes
rolled back in his head prior to the accident.  The patient
was extracted from the vehicle with loss of pulse.  He was
defibrillated and found to be asystolic.  While they were
preparing to intubate the patient he regained consciousness
and was transferred to BIMDC.

While en route, he was intubated for airway protection.
Abdominal and head CT showed multiple rib fractures.  He also
had sustained a laceration to his head.  He was admitted to
