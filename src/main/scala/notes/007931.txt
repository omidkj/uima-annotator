   RESPIRATORY CULTURE (Preliminary):


Brief Hospital Course:
44 yo M with ALS s/p trach and peg admitted to the ICU with PNA
requiring additional vent support increased from baseline.

1. PNEUMONIA: He remained hemodynamically stable throughout his
admission.  He was diagnosed with pneumonia seen on outside
hospital CT. He was admitted to the ICU because he is
chronically vented.  CT with contrast was performed and showed
no large PE. Patient was treated with Ceftriaxone and
Levofloxacin initially, with plans for an 8 day course.  Blood
cultures remained negative.  His sputum culture grew staph
aureus and his MRSA screen was positive, and his antibiotics
were changed to vancomycin, for a total of an 8 day course. A
PICC line was placed, and patient was discharged with Vancomycin
to be administered by VNA.
He was not at his baseline ventilator requirements on discharge,
however given that he is vented at night, and has a vent nurse
at home for assistance, the patient felt comfortable and was
quite eager to go home. He was comfortable managing his
ventilator settings by himself, as he had been doing for the 2
weeks prior to admission.

2. ALS: Had not see his neurologist in 2 years. His Rilutec was
continued. We arranged outpatient Neurology follow up for him.
