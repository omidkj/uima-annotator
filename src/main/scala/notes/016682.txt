[**2128-12-22**] TTE: The left atrium is normal in size. There is
moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular cavity is unusually small. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is moderately depressed (LVEF= 35-40 %) with
apical akinesis/hypokinesis. Cannot exclude apical thrombus
(apical views are technically suboptimal). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is no aortic valve
stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is
seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Severe
[4+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is moderate
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: [**Age over 90 **]yo F with MMP who presents with dyspnea, fever and
altered mental status found to have urosepsis.
.
# Severe Sepsis - WBC 16.4, T 102, Tachypnea to 40., lactate
2.8, abrupt alteration in mental status. Chronic Klebsiella UTI
with UA significan t for >50 WBCs and moderate leukocyte
esterase. Patient received broad coverage with vanc, levo,
meropenem in ED; given persistance of UTI, known resistance of
the organism to quinolones, and likely reistant to meropenem,
was switched to aztreonam on arrival to the MICU.  Pt received
gentle IVFs in setting of radiographic evidence of mild
pulmonary edema and BNP>70,000 suggestive of CHF.  Patient
remained fluid responsive throughout the first hours of
admission and then became progressively tachycardic and
tachypnic.  The patient died at 5:10am on [**2128-12-23**] from
respiratory failure secondary to urosepsis and congestive heart
failure.

# CHF/Respiratory Failure - BNP>70,000 and mild pulmonary edema
on CXR, MI v troponin leak in setting of tachycardia. Clinically
dry, no elev JVP, however, lung sounds were very coarse.
Patient received IVF boluses in attempt to maintain urine output
and blood pressure.  When patient became tachypnic, a trial of
BIPAP was attempted, but the patient persisted to breath near 40
times per minute while maintaining oxygen saturations in the
high 90s.

# Tachycardia - likely secondary to respiratory effort v pain.
Patient was initially treated with fentanyl and morphine for
pain.  Patient then developed AFIB w/ rapid ventricular rate
with intermittent episodes of hypotension requiring the use of
IV lopressor and digoxin to obtain rate control.

# Pain: s/p L AKA [**12-9**], rheumatoid arthritis.  Pain control was
provided with fentanyl patch and prn morphine.

# HTN: Hold BBlocker

# DM: Diet controlled per report.  Patient was managed on
fingersticks q4h and an insulin SS.

# F/E/N: Puree foods, gravy thick. Honey thick liquids. Replete
lytes PRN.

# PPx: Bowel regimen, PPI, sq Heparin

# Access: PIVs

# Code Status: DNR/DNI, it was discussed with patient's health
care proxy the grave nature of her sepsis and impending
respiratory failure.  After the patient was unable to tolerate
BIPAP in the setting of tachypnea, tachycardia, and hypotension,
goals of care were transitioned to comfort measures only.

# Communication: son [**Name (NI) 109259**] [**Name (NI) 12246**], HCP was made aware of
[**Hospital 228**] medical course throughout this admission and was
notified at the time of death.
