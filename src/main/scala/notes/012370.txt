Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2745**]
Chief Complaint:
Hypotension, lethargy

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
mechanical ventilation

History of Present Illness:
53 y.o. spanish speaking female with a history of
panhypopituitarism, obstructive sleep apnea, pulmonary artery,
obesity-hypoventilation, and diastolic heart failure who
presented from home with hypotension and lethargy.  History
obtained from medical records as pt intubated and sedated.  Per
notes, she came in with HA and lethargy initially, but was found
to be hypotensive and febrile and eventually developed
hypercarbic respiratory distress requiring intubation and
transfer to the unit.

Pt has had multiple hospitalizations, most recently [**Date range (1) **]
([**1-5**] prior to that), for hypercarbic respiratory failure
complicated by hypotension, often in the setting of fever
without definite source of infection.  Recently admit for
hypercarbic respiratory failure felt to be d/t progression of
obstructive sleep apnea and hypoventilation syndrome.  Also was
hypotensive transiently, felt to be d/t hypoadrenalism, volume
depletion, and propofol during intubation.  Also had E.coli UTI
resistent to cipro and was treated with CTX.

In the ED initial vitals were 100.7, 47/11, 22, 99% on 2L.  She
was given fluids and solumedrol 125mg IV x 1 and BP increased to
104/70.  CXR with concern for possible infiltrate and vancomycin
1gm IV, CTX 1mg IV, and azithromycin 500mg PO x 1  given.  Cr
elevated from baseline of 1.4 to 3.0.  UA positive.  Lactate
1.0.  In setting of hypotension and suspected infection, concern
was for early sepsis.  Trop 0.01.  BP trended down again to SBP
80??????s and she was given 10mg IV decadron and central line placed
and BP responded. She had not been written for BIPAP and by
change of shift in a.m. appeared more lethargic and more
difficult to arouse. BIPAP ordered and gas after one hour was
7.2/80/86.  She remained lethargic, pulling at lines and BIPAP,
and concern was for airway protection, and she was intubated
(propofol, succinate given).  CT head negative.

CT abd/pelvis w/o contrast [**2120-5-15**]:
CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: The lung bases
demonstrate subsegmental atelectasis. Cardiomegaly. No evidence
of pleural or pericardial effusion. The liver is diffusely
hypodense consistent with fatty infiltration. The gallbladder,
spleen, pancreas, adrenal glands, and kidneys are within normal
limits allowing for the lack of IV contrast. There is no
mesenteric or retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy. The
intra-abdominal loops of small and large bowel are unremarkable.
No secondary signs of bowel ischemia are seen. A normal appendix
is seen. Small fat-containing umbilical hernia. There is no free
air or free fluid within the abdomen. Dependent fluid in the
soft tissues overlying the posterior spine.

CT OF THE PELVIS WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: The bladder, distal
ureters, rectum, and sigmoid are unremarkable. There is no free
fluid within the pelvis. No pelvic or inguinal lymphadenopathy
is seen.

[**Month/Day/Year **] WINDOWS: No suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions are
identified. Degenerative changes of the lumbar spine. Short
pedicles throughout. Lumbar spine canal stenosis is present at
the L3-4 and L4-5 levels.

IMPRESSION:
1. No CT findings to explain patient's symptoms.
2. Fatty liver.
3. Spinal canal stenosis, incompletely imaged, an MR study may
be performed for further characterization, if warranted by the
nature of the patient's back pain.

Please note that the study is limited due to lack of IV
contrast.

CT head w/o IV Contrats [**2120-5-15**]:
IMPRESSION: Limited study without evidence of acute intracranial
process.


Brief Hospital Course:
The patient is a 53 y.o.f. with panhypotituitarism, OSA, obesity
hypoventilation, pulmonary HTN, and diastolic heart failure who
p/w HA and found to have hypotension and fever and intubated for
hypercarbic respiratory failure and with UTI by UA

# Hypercarbic respiratory distress ?????? The precipitant was likely
not being on regular BIPAP overnight.  The patient was initially
intubated in the ED for hypercarbia and somnolence.  She was put
initially on AC, and then switched to pressure support.  She
initially was placed on high pressure, and eventually was weaned
down and sedation was stopped.  She was extubated on [**5-16**].  She
did well during the rest of her [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] stay.  She will need
overnight BiPap at her home settings.  She also uses home O2,
and should be continued on 2L but keeping her O2 sats btwn
92-94%.

# Hypotension ?????? Initially the patient was hypotensive thought to
be due to a UTI.  She was given IVFs in the ED, with improvement
in her BP.  She never required pressors.  We continued her on
ceftriaxone since in the past she has had e.coli resistant to
ciprofloxacin.  Her blood pressure improved, and she was
eventually restarted on her anti-hypertensive medications for
high BP prior to being sent out of the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].  Urine cultures are
no growth.

# Panhypopituitarism ?????? The patient's total T4 is in normal
range.  The patient is on levothyroxine, steroids, and
desmopressin.  She was initially put on stress dose steroids
which were quickly tapered down as the patient's respiratory
status improved.

# Acute Kidney Injury ?????? Baseline creatinine 1.0, with no known
kidney disease.  The likely etiology likely prerenal in setting
of hypotension.  Her acute renal failure resolved.

# Cardiac
ISCHEMIA ?????? No signs or symptoms of ischemia
PUMP ?????? EF in past normal.  Has diastolic dysfunction.  Control
HR and BP to prevent further pulmonary edema.
RHYTHM ?????? NSR

On day of discharge, the patient was breathing comfortably,
ambulating well and at baseline respiratory status per her
daughter.
