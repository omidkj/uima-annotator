Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2181**]
Chief Complaint:
Shock

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Patient had a tunnelled HD line placed on [**2178-6-3**].
.
Patient was intubated at OSH, extubated [**5-28**] - total of 11 days.


History of Present Illness:
29 year-old male patient with a history of DM2, obesity, OSA and
pericarditis (6 months ago) who presented to [**Hospital1 14360**] on [**2178-5-16**] with chest pain, back pain, fevers, chills
and shortness of breath for one day. His pain was described as
sharp, worse with inspiration and on laying supine and relieved
by sitting and leaning forward. He also reported diaphoresis and
cough productive of green sputum. He had a similar episode 6
months prior to admission and was diagnosed with pna and "fluid
accumulation around the heart". He was treated with NSAIDS at a
hospital in [**State 3914**].
.
His vital signs on presentation to the OSH were: Temp 103, BP
89/30, HR 116-138, RR 28, 97% on 2 L. His WBC was 15 (73 N, 11
L), CPK 253, (MB 21.5, Index 8.5), trop I 2.88. Glucose was 310.
Bili 4.2, alk phos 91, ast 416, alt 325, LDH 1130. CXR was
negative for infiltrates, ECG with STE 1mm in I and AVL, PR
depression in I and AVL. He received 2L IVF boluses, 1gm of CTX
and 500mg of Azithromycin. He was given a diagnosis of
percarditis, treated with Motrin 800mg tid, and admitted to teh
ICU.
.
An Echo showed an EF 25%, global HK, dilated LV. There was no
pericardial effusion and RV appeared normal size. Dopamine was
used for BP support and the patient was subsequently intubated
for respiratory distress. He was found to be in DKA with blood
glucose in the 600's and ketones in the urine. 100mg of lovenox
was given empirically and was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further
management.
.
In the [**Hospital1 18**] CCU, the patient was thought to be in either
cardiogenic shock or septic shock from a pneumonia. He was
continued on Vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and azithromycin. Renal,
GI and ID were consulted for renal failure, transaminitis (to
AST 11,916) and septic shock of somewhat unclear etiology. Renal
did not feel that there is an acute need for HD at this point
and agreed with IVF and pressors.  Infectious disease got a
history of the patient recently removing dead rodents from an
automobile fan and felt that atypical organisms were highly
likely. They recommended changing azithromycin to doxycycline.
Hepatology felt the clinical picture was most consistent with
shock liver.  The patient is being transferred to MICU per the
request of ID and given evolving septic shock.

GEN: morbidly obese young man intubated and sedated
HEENT: ETT in place, mmm
Neck: large neck but no JVD appreciated
CV: tachycardic, regular rhythm, no m/r/g
PULM: mechanical breath sounds appreciated, crackles at the
bases bilaterally
ABD: obese, NABS, NT/ND
Ext: cool extremities, no c/c/e, 1+ DP and PT b/l
Neuro: intubated, sedated
Derm: no rashes noted.

Pertinent Results:
CXR ([**5-17**]): Ill-defined opacities are present in the left mid and
lower zones consistent with pulmonary consolidation.

CXR ([**5-18**]): Air bronchogram present in the left lower lobe
suggesting LLL pneumonia.  Increased opacification in the right
lower zone c/w atelectasis rather than pneumonia

Abd US ([**5-18**]): Limited examination.  Echogenic liver consistent
with fatty infiltration.  Other forms of liver disease,
including more significant hepatic fibrosis or cirrhosis, cannot
be excluded on the basis of this examination. Patent left and
middle hepatic veins and left portal vein.  Otherwise, extremely
limited Doppler examination of the liver.

Chest/Abd CT ([**5-18**]): Moderate-sized bilateral pleural effusions.
No acute abdominal pathology

Sinus CT ([**5-18**]): No sinusitis.

Echo ([**5-18**]): Mild symmetric LVH. LV cavity moderately dilated.
Severe global left ventricular hypokinesis with EF 15-20%. No
masses or thrombi are seen in  LV. RV systolic function appears
depressed. LV inflow pattern suggests a restrictive filling
abnormality, with elevated left atrial pressure

ECHO [**2178-5-25**]:  Conclusions:  There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular  cavity size is
normal. There is mild global left ventricular hypokinesis. EF
45%. There is no pericardial effusion.  Compared with the report
of the prior study (images unavailable for review) of [**2178-5-18**],
the LVEF has improved and the LV cavity size has normalized.

B/L LE US:  CONCLUSION: Study is limited by body habitus, but
there is no evidence of DVT in the left or right lower
extremity.

CT CHEST/ABDOMEN [**5-27**]:  IMPRESSION:
1. Overall stable appearance of the chest, abdomen and pelvis.
No CT evidence of pancreatitis.
2. Stable bilateral lower lobe consolidations which could
represent aspiration or atelectasis.
3. Stable splenomegaly.


Brief Hospital Course:
*Shock:
There was an initial concern for cardiogenic shock in the
setting of possible pericarditis/myocarditis, EKG changes,
elevated cardiac enzymes and Echo showing EF 25%. However,
fevers, elevated WBC count and low SVR suggested more of a
septic picture. Additionally, his cardiac output was elevated
(though difficult to use those numbers which were from CVP and
not swan). Shock was complicated by acute renal and hepatic
failure, respiratory failure, relative adrenal insufficiency,
cardiac depression and DKA. Source of septic shock was initially
unclear and included multifocal pneumonia,
pericarditis/myocarditis, atypical organism in setting of
exposure to rodents.  ?Hanta virus vs. [**Location (un) **] vs. Mycoplasma?
Chest/Abd CT without pathology. No sinusitis on Sinus CT. In
terms of BP, pt was appropriately switched from Dopamine to
Levophed which was quickly titrated down, and discontinued more
than a week before discharge. He remained hemodynamically stable
throughout the remainder of his hospital course. He was treated
with Zosyn and Vancomycin for a total of 13 days, and
Azithromycin for a total of 5 days.
All blood and urine cultures showed no growth, he had negative
serologies for Chlamydia pneumoniae, [**Location (un) **] B, Leptospira,
Mycoplasma pneumoniae, HCV, HBV, Influenza and
Parainfluenza,ANCA and [**Doctor First Name **]. He was IgG positive, but IgM
negative for EBV and CMV. He also tested positive for Legionella
Antibodies and hepatitis. He was further tested positive for IgM
Hantavirus, however the confirmatory [**Doctor First Name **] for Sin Nombre virus
was negative. A repeat serology was sent to the state lab and
the results were still pending on discharge.  He was afebrile,
with stable blood pressures at discharge.
.
*Fever:
As above, the etiology of his septic shock was unclear. There
was a suggestion of multifocal infiltrates on CXR suggesting
possible pneumonia with bacterial pathogen. ID was consulted and
considered atypical organisms such as mycoplasma, chlamydia,
legionella, Leptospirosis and viral pathogens such as hepatitis,
influenza, adeno, CMV, EBV, HIV, [**Location (un) **] and Hanta virus.
Legionella IgG antibody returned with high titers of 256.  This
should be repeated at the end of [**Month (only) 116**] (aroun
