HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a [**Age over 90 **]-year-old
female who was initially admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 196**] and then the ICU
and finally to the General Medicine Service.

This is a [**Age over 90 **]-year-old with the past medical history of
heart failure, and type 2 diabetes mellitus with multiple
medical admissions for chest pain.  The patient was admitted
on the [**9-28**], complaining of increasing chest
pain, which awoke her from her sleep.  She also complained of
increasing shortness of breath and diaphoresis.  The chest
pain was relieved with two tablets Tylenol #3.  At no time
did the pain radiate to her neck, upper extremities, or back.
beats per minute, left axis deviation, Q waves in lead 3,
which were old, along with delayed R wave progression.  The
chest x-ray in the emergency room showed a picture consistent
with congestive heart failure with peribronchial cuffing and
increasing left-side pleural effusion and a small right
pleural effusion.  The patient was given 25 mg Lopressor and
?????? tablet sublingual nitroglycerin in the emergency room.  The
patient went into respiratory distress requiring a
nonrebreather and the blood pressure dropped to approximately
60 systolic.  The patient was eventually intubated and
started on dopamine drip.  She was then transferred to the
ICU for further evaluation.  The patient's stay in the ICU
was complicated by the development of aspiration pneumonia in
the left lower lobe.  Blood cultures grew out a gram positive
rod cocci and she was started on Vancomycin and Levaquin.
She was successfully extubated on the 8th day of her
admission.  She would not tolerate BiPAP.  She refused to be
intubated again.  She had minor respiratory distress
following extubation, which was treated with morphine, Lasix,
and nitropaste.  Of note, the patient and the patient's next
of [**Doctor First Name **] both determined that the patient would be a Do Not
Resuscitate/Do Not Intubate status.  The patient also has
refused any further evaluation or workup for her
cardiovascular diseases.  She was transferred to the floor on
the [**2195-10-9**] for further treatment and placement
in
a rehabilitation facility.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:

gradient of approximately 127 mmHg and a mean of 71 mmHg
Mercury.
2.  Type 2 diabetes mellitus.
3.  Coronary artery disease.
4.  Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.
5.  Osteoporosis.
6.  Lower GI bleed.
7.  Left hip fracture.
8.  Chronic constipation.

ALLERGIES:  The patient is allergic to PENICILLIN.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1.  Lasix 60 mg PO q.d.
2.  Amiodarone 200 mg PO q.d.
3.  Imdur 60 mg PO q.d.
4.  Lopressor 12.5 mg PO b.i.d.
5.  Colace 100 mg PO b.i.d.
6.  Ultram 50 to 100 mg PO q.12h.p.r.n. chest pain not to
exceed 200 mg q.d.
7.  Amaryl 1 mg PO q.d.

White blood count was 12.  The hematocrit was 28.6 and the
platelet count was 281,000.  Chem 7 showed the sodium of 144,
potassium 3, chloride 100, bicarbonate 33, BUN 34, creatinine
of 1, and glucose 163, calcium 8.4, phosphate 3.6, magnesium
2.0.  The iron study showed a TIBC of 198, haptoglobin of
344, ferritin level pending, TRF 152, and the Vancomycin
level drawn on the [**10-9**] was 16.9,  Multiple
cultures were drawn during her stay in the ICU.  A
catheterized tip on the [**10-4**] grew out
Staphylococcus aureus coagulase negative.  Blood culture
drawn on the [**2195-10-3**] grew out gram positive rods
and MRSA.  Chest x-ray showed bilateral pleural effusion left
greater than right and a left lower lobe opacity.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Examination revealed the following:
VITAL SIGNS:  The patient was afebrile.  Heart rate was 55
beats per minute.  Blood pressure 104/3.  Respiratory rate 18
beats per minute and she was saturating at 98% on two liters
of nasal cannula.  GENERAL:  In general, this is a frail
elderly woman lying in her bed.  She is alert and oriented
times three.  She is in no apparent distress.  Oropharynx was
clear.  Mucous membranes were moist.  HEART:  Heart was
regular rate and rhythm with a 3/6 systolic crescendo
decrescendo murmur best heard in the right upper sternal
border.  LUNGS:  Lungs revealed diffuse crackles throughout
and rales heard in the lower [**1-1**] of the lungs.  ABDOMEN:
Abdomen was protuberant, soft, nontender, and nondistended.
There was no guarding or rebound.  She had normoactive bowel
sounds.  EXTREMITIES:  Extremities were warm with trace
pitting edema.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  This is a [**Age over 90 **]-year-old female with a
significant history of cardiac disease to include critical
aortic stenosis, congestive heart failure, coronary artery
disease, who has refused any further cardiac intervention.
The patient was admitted initially to [**Hospital Unit Name 196**] for chest pain.
She developed respiratory distress, which required intubation
and an 11-day admission to the Intensive Care Unit.  She was
successfully extubated and transferred to the floor for
placement.  The brief stay on the General Medicine Team was
relatively uneventful.

#1.  CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE:  The patient has a history of
critical aortic stenosis, proximal atrial fibrillation,
coronary artery disease, and congestive heart failure.  She
has refused any further cardiac intervention to include
cardiac catheterization, valvuloplasty.  We continued her on
aspirin 325 mg PO q.d.  We also continued her Amiodarone for
history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.  We also continued
her on a low dose Lasix 40 mg PO q. 12 hours.

#2.  PULMONARY:  The patient's pulmonary status improved
throughout her stay and the supplemental oxygen requirement
decreased.  Chest x-ray showed stable bilateral pleural
effusions, but the apices were improved.  She remained on her
Vancomycin and Levaquin.  On discharge, she was saturating at
99% on two liters of oxygen.  She received Ipratropium
bromide and Albuterol as needed.

#3.  HEMATOLOGY:  Iron studies showed that the patient had
anemia of chronic disease.  She did not require any
transfusions and the hematocrit stay stable.  She was
discharged with a multivitamin.
