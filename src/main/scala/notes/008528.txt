CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Kidney transplant.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 70-year-old woman with
end-stage renal disease secondary to Type 2 diabetes mellitus
which never required insulin.  She has been on dialysis for
five years via left forearm shunt and she presents to the
[**Hospital1 69**] having been selected for
a cadaveric renal transplant.  She does make urine.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Hypertension, insulin dependent
diabetes mellitus Type 2, hypercholesterolemia,
gastroesophageal reflux disease, arthritis, left forearm
atrioventricular graft, hysterectomy, appendectomy and a left
hip and left fibular fracture status post open reduction,
internal fixation

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Noncontributory.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  She does not smoke, she does not drink,she
lives alone.  She uses hearing aids.

MEDICATIONS:
1. Zocor 20 mg once daily
2. Prilosec 20 mg once daily
3. Folic Acid 1 mg once daily
4. PhosLo three times a day.
5. Diltiazem 100 mg once daily
6. Sulfa 5 mg once daily
7. Glucosamine 750 mg twice a day.
8. Destil 25 mg three times a week.


PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  She is afebrile with stable vital
signs.  She is in no apparent distress alert and oriented
times three although she was hard of hearing.  Her heart rate
was regular rate and rhythm.  Her lungs were clear to
auscultation bilaterally.  The abdomen was soft, lower
midline scar from her hysterectomy and a right lower quadrant
scar from her appendectomy.  Her extremities were warm and
well profused and her left forearm atrioventricular graft had
a palpable thrill.

Mrs. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to the Transplant Surgery Service.
Her preop labs were unremarkable including hematocrit of 37,
creatinine 6.9.  She was made NPO and consented for the
operating room, where she underwent a cadaveric renal
transplant on [**2121-10-7**].  She underwent a calcium free
immunosuppressant postop with gammaglobulin, Solu Medrol and
CellCept.  She did have delayed graft function
postoperatively and underwent hemodialysis on the third.  She
continued in euvolemic state with hemodialysis the next week
however, her urine output was slow to pick up and on postop
day eight a renal biopsy was performed to confirm or deny
rejection of the transplanted kidney.  Rejection was not seen
but acute tubular necrosis was seen in the biopsy results.
Later
that evening Mrs. [**Known lastname **] developed a rapid atrial
fibrillation with hypertension, she was transferred to the
Intensive care unit.  Soon thereafter her heart rate was
stabilized and she was transferred back to the floor however,
because she persistently had a sluggish urine output a
transplant renal ultrasound was performed on the 15th which
showed loss of the renal vein blood flow.  An Magnetic
resonance imaging of the transplanted kidney confirmed renal
vein thrombosis and Mrs. [**Known lastname **] was taken to the operating
room for a transplant nephrectomy on [**2121-10-21**].  Mrs.[**Location (un) 22878**] second postoperative course was complicated.  On
postop day two, with another bout of unstable atrial
fibrillation which was resistant to Adenosine and
cardioversion, but responded to a infusion, then she was
transitioned over to Amiodarone and her heart rate was stable
thereafter.  She was transferred back onto the floor from the
second intensive care unit stay on [**2121-10-26**] and she was doing
well enough by [**2121-10-28**] that she was transferred to a
rehabilitation facility.

Her organ system based issues on discharge are as follows:
Neurologically she is intact.  Cardiovascular:  She is on
Amiodarone 400 mg q AM, 200 mg q PM for the next two weeks
with switching to 200 mg twice a day for two weeks after
that.  She is also being anti-coagulated with Heparin drip
and transitioned to Coumadin for her atrial fibrillation.
She will have follow-up appointments with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] within
the next month.  She is also to have continued monitoring
either with [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] of Hearts monitor or with Telemetry for
the next few days.  Respiratory:  She is intact.

supplements.  FEN:  She does receive hemodialysis currently
on a Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday schedule.  Hematologic:  She
is intact.  ID:  She is on day 12 of 14 for an empiric C.
Diff infection.  Endocrine:  Mrs. [**Known lastname **] is on standing
doses of insulin as well as regular insulin sliding scale.
Prophylaxis:  She is on Prilosec for her gastroesophageal
reflux disease.  Please refer to the discharge paper work for
the final doses of these medications as well as the
instructions regarding anti-coagulation therapy.
