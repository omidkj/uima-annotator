Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Penicillins / Erythromycin Base / Heparin Agents

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 30**]
Chief Complaint:
Tracheomalacia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2156-7-30**]: had rigid bronch, electrocautery and balloon dilatation
of trachea, and upsizing of her trach to a #7
[**2156-8-9**]: rigid bronch, T-tube placement
L-PICC placement

History of Present Illness:
Txfer from [**Hospital3 3583**]
In [**1-30**], patient was difficult to extubate s/p CABG and required
a tracheostomy. She was subsequently sent to pulmonary rehab.
.
She was referred to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in [**6-25**] who performed a rigid
bronchoscopy here followed by replacement of her tracheostomy
tube. She was found to have a circumferential area of stenosis
below the cricoid cartilage extending 6cm; it was not felt to be
granulation tissue. DEbridement was minimally successful. A CT
scan was done which showed that she had:
-Focal tracheal stenosis at the inferior extent of the
tracheostomy tube.
-There was also: proximal narrowing which may relate to
granulation tissue versus secretions.
-Polypoid soft tissue density just above the insertion of the
tracheostomy tube may relate to granulation tissue.
.
- she was discharged back to rehab
.
On [**2156-7-4**], she was then admitted to [**Hospital3 **] with SOB
and desatted to the low 90s. She was given O2, suctioning and
nebulizers without significant improvement. Initially, she was
started on Levoquin and finished a 14 day course for suspected
bronchitis. Her respiratatory status improved and hence she did
not require ventilation.
.
She was found on HOD #2 to have Enterococcus bacteremia - via Cx
x 2 on [**7-4**] and Cx x 2 on [**7-5**]. (A TTE was negative for
vegetations. A TEE was not performed). As such, She was started
on Vancomycin with subsequent negative surveillance cultures.
.
[**7-8**]: ID was consulted. They added on Gent once her urine
culture came back positive for Klebsiella UTI. This particular
Klebsiella UTI was only sensitive to Gentamicin, Imipenem, Zosyn
and Cefotetan.
- Started on Imipenem on [**2156-7-24**] for this.
.
On [**7-19**], she was obtunded and had significant mucous secretions
and mucus plugging requiring suctioning; ENT changed her
cuffless trach from a #6 to a #4 and transitioned to a trach
collar after transient ventilation.
.
On [**7-19**], she has a IJ TLC placed in OR at [**Hospital1 46**].
On [**7-22**], noticed to have "mild stridor" and mild tachypnea and
was replaced on a ventilator.
.
Of note:
- was found to be C Diff + and was started on flagyl
.
Today, she is transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further options regarding
placement of a new tracheostomy tube.

Pertinent Results:
REPORTS:
.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2156-7-24**] 8:17 PM
A tracheostomy tube terminates within the trachea just above the
level of the clavicles. Left internal jugular vascular catheter
terminates in the superior vena cava, and a nasogastric tube
courses below the diaphragm. Cardiac silhouette is enlarged.
There are patchy and linear areas of atelectasis at the lung
bases. There is a questionable small left pleural effusion.
.
TEE [**2156-7-26**]
Conclusions:
No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of
the left
atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of the right
atrium/right atrial
appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color
Doppler. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF>55%). The ascending,
transverse and descending thoracic aorta are normal in diameter
and free of atherosclerotic plaque. A bioprosthetic aortic valve
prosthesis is present. The aortic prosthesis appears well
seated, with thin leaflets that display normal motion. There is
no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Normal aortic bioprosthesis. Mild mitral
regurgitation with mildly thickened leaflets. No vegetation
seen.

2. Degenerative changes as described above.
.
CHEST PORT. LINE PLACEMENT  [**2156-7-29**] 8:57 AM
IMPRESSION:
1. Left-sided PICC with tip in SVC. Findings discussed with
[**Doctor First Name **] of IV therapy at 10:30 a.m.
2. Improving opacity in the left perihilar region could
represent improving aspiration or asymmetric edema. Stable
bibasilar atelectasis.
.
IMAGING:

IMPRESSION:
1) Distention of small bowel suggestive of functional colonic
abnormality causing small-bowel obstruction.
2) Interval decrease in size of transverse colon now measuring 4
cm in widest diameter.
