CT PELVIS W/CONTRAST  [**2198-7-12**] 7:38 AM
IMPRESSION:

1. Focus of active extravasation within the region of the left
external pudendal artery with surrounding hematoma and
hemorrhage within the pelvis.

2. Right sacral and bilateral superior and inferior pubic rami
fractures. Right acetabular fracture.

3. Right middle lobe pulmonary nodule and left lower lobe
nodular ground glass opacities. Dedicated chest CT can be
performed to ensure stability in one year in the absence of
known malignancy.

4. Mild intra- and extra-hepatic biliary dilatation, which may
be secondary to prior to papillotomy and should be clinically
correlated.

5. Sigmoid diverticulosis.

[**Numeric Identifier 7536**] EMBO NON NEURO  [**2198-7-12**] 8:42 AM
IMPRESSION: Active arterial bleeding via multiple small branches
of the internal iliac artery on the left as well as predominant
feeding branch being the inferior pudendal artery. Vessels were
selectively catheterized and embolized using Gelfoam and coils
with cessation of active extravasation. No feeding vessels
visualized from the right iliac system.

Cardiology Report ECHO Study Date of [**2198-7-13**]
Conclusions:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall
left
ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right
ventricular chamber
size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) are mildly
thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic
regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened and there may be
prolapse
(views suboptimal). Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is moderate pulmonary
artery
systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.



Brief Hospital Course:
She was admitted to the Trauma Service. Orthopedics and Spine
Surgery were consulted given her injuries. She was taken to
Interventional Radiology for embolization of a bleeding pelvic
artery. Her other injuries were managed non operatively; a hard
cervical collar is to be worn for the next 3 months; she will
follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 363**] in the next 4 weeks for repeat spine
imaging. Her pelvic fractures were also managed non operatively,
she is TDWB on her RLE and WBAT on her LLE. Her Fosamax was
restarted; Calcium and Vitamin D were also added for bone
prophylaxis.

Speech and Swallow evaluation was also done given some
difficulty noted when swallowing pills. A video swallow was done
in which she did pass. Her diet was upgraded to thin liquids and
soft solids diet. Her meds may be given whole in applesauce.
