accommodation.  Her neck was supple without any thyromegaly
or lymphadenopathy.  Her lungs were clear bilaterally with
very mild minimal rales at the right base.  Heart was regular

systolic ejection murmur.  Abdomen was soft, nontender,
nondistended with positive bowel sounds without any rebound
or guarding.  Extremities had no cyanosis, clubbing or edema.
There were multiple varicosities bilaterally and multiple
areas of ecchymosis bilaterally.  The patient was alert and
oriented x 3. Cranial nerves II-XII were grossly intact.  She
was following all commands.

PREOPERATIVE LABS:  White count 8.2, hematocrit 35.3,
platelet count 251,000.  Sodium 140, potassium 4.3, chloride
102, bicarbonate 30, BUN 18, creatinine 1.1, blood sugar 104.
ALT 37, AST 38, LDH 195, alkaline phosphatase thirty seventy
three, amylase 154, lipase 29, total bilirubin 0.3, magnesium
1.7.  PT 13.0, PTT 23.7, INR 1.1.

A chest x-ray showed a small right and left pulmonary nodule.
CT scan was recommended to follow up for this nodule.  That
was performed as a follow up to the one done on [**8-21**].
CT scan [**2135-10-3**] showed a right upper lobe benign calcified
granuloma which was seen, and a previously seen nodule on the
chest CT in the left upper lobe, a nodule which was below the
resolution of the plain film.  A three month followup chest
CT was recommended.  Please refer to the final report dated
[**2135-10-3**].

Preop EKG showed sinus bradycardia at 58, first degree A-V
block, as well as reverting to sinus rhythm from atrial
fibrillation.  Please refer to the EKG final [**Location (un) 1131**] dated
[**2135-10-3**].

Th[**Last Name (STitle) 1050**] was admitted to [**2-25**] one day prior to surgery.
The patient was cleared by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (STitle) **] have a negative
urinalysis so that we could proceed with surgery, and on
[**2135-10-4**] the patient underwent a valve replacement with a 21
[**First Name9 (NamePattern2) 12640**] [**Last Name (un) 3843**]-[**Doctor Last Name **] pericardial valve, a coronary artery
bypass grafting x 2 with a vein graft to the OM and a vein
graft to the RCA, and a supra annular aortic root enlargement
by Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) **].  She was transferred to the
cardiothoracic ICU in stable on a propofol drip at 20
ug/kg/minute, Levophed at 0.05 ug/kg/minute, and finishing
her aprotinin.  At 5:45 in the afternoon after her operation,
she had an emergent left pleural tube placed, as her postop
chest x-ray revealed a large left pneumothorax.  The patient
tolerated this without incident and was already sedated on
propofol and intubated in the intensive care unit.

On postoperative day one, the patient was in normal sinus
rhythm with blood pressure of 108/49.  Had been extubated and
was satting 95 percent.  Started Lasix diuresis.  Postop labs
as follows:  white count 15, hematocrit 28, platelet count
118,000, potassium 5.3, BUN 8, creatinine 0.5, PT 14, INR
1.3.  Her left pleural tube remained in place.  Swan-Ganz
catheter was discontinued.  Her diet was advanced.  Also
noted at the time of her left chest tube placement was that
her right mainstem bronchus had been intubated.  Endotracheal
tube was readjusted at the same time as left pleural tube was
placed.

On postoperative day one later in the day, the patient was
transferred out to [**2-25**], was switched over to p.o. Percocet
for pain.  Her incisions were clean, dry and intact, and
cardiac rehabilitation was begun on the floor.  The patient
was evaluated by Physical Therapy as well as by Case
Management.

On postoperative day two, she was hemodynamically stable,
satting 99 percent.  Her chest tubes remained in place during
the morning and were removed later in the afternoon.  Her
pacing wires were out and her Foley catheter was removed.
The patient was doing well and was stable and was having good
pain control on oral meds.  Her creatinine remained stable at
.9 and her white count was 15.5, with a stable hematocrit of
29.6.  She went back and forth between atrial fibrillation
and sinus rhythm.

During the next day, her chest tube was removed and her
pacing wires were removed on the twelfth.  She had some
complaints of diarrhea.  She reverted back to sinus rhythm
again after electrolyte replacement, was satting 93 percent
on room air.  She was encouraged to increase her activity
with PT.  Her INR came back at 1.6 that morning.  Colace was
discontinued.  A repeat INR was checked, and after dosing her
now with her 2 mg of Coumadin that evening, the patient would
have to remain in the hospital until she became therapeutic.

She was seen daily by Physical Therapy. On postoperative day
four, she did a level four and was doing very well, and
continued to increase her activity tolerance.  She continued
to be dosed with two mg of Coumadin in the evening, with
discharge planning begun.  She also continued with her
aspirin and Lasix diuresis, and Singulair and Flovent for her
pulmonary toilet.  She continued to do very well.

Sh[**Last Name (STitle) **]a level five on [**10-9**], the day of discharge,
and was discharged to home with VNA services.  She was
instructed to follow up in our wound clinic in two weeks post
discharge, to follow up with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 24522**], her primary
care physician, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] two to three weeks, and to see Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] in the office in four weeks for her postop surgical
visit.
