Brief Hospital Course:
Impression/Plan: 88 y/o man with HTN, ESRD, transferred for
aortic dissection, non-surgical, transferred to medicine for
workup of back pain, found to be febrile on transfer. was
diagnosed with a pneumonia and found to be hypoxic on the floor.
was then transferred to the MICU for management of his hypoxia
and pneumonia.  .
.
# Hypoxic Respiratory Failure
Etiology unclear. CXR and CT-A is unimpressive for pna. However
given patient's worrisome respiratory status started on
Vanc/Zosyn. Blood cultures grew [**First Name9 (NamePattern2) 8974**] [**Last Name (un) 36**] to nafcillin so PICC
line was placed. Fluid overload is unlikely, patient was
recently dialyzed and no evidence on imaging. PE is unlikely
given negative CT-A and patient has been on Coumadin.
- cont nafcillin for a total of 2 weeks ending [**2101-3-16**].
- PICC line placed [**2101-3-2**]
.
#. Fever
Patient had been spiking fevers on the floor.  He has been
afebrile in the MICU.  He is being tx for [**Month/Day/Year 8974**] bacteremia [**3-4**] to
RIJ tunneled line infection. MRI of spine was negative for
epidural abscess.
-  Surveillance cultures to date have been negative.  Surface
echo was negative for endocarditis.
- continue nafcillin through PICC line
.
# Aortic dissection: CT [**Doctor First Name **] and vasc did not feel that the 2
areas of dissection/ulceration were enough to explain back pain.
 They recommended BP control.  (SBP <150).
- Will continue patient on lisinopril.
- start low dose metoprolol [**Hospital1 **]
- cardiac and vascular surgery have no further input, medical
management, contact if questions
.
Tachycardia: usually occurs in relation to movement and slight
dyspnea.
- start low dose metoprolol [**Hospital1 **]
.
# Anemia: continue to follow HCT 27.7 today (29.0 yesterday)
.
- continue to follow daily
- guiaic negative
- iron, TIBC, transferrin low; ferritin and folate high
- start Fe sulfate 325 [**Hospital1 **]
- consider EPO with HD
.
Fistula thrombosis: patient presented to the hospital on
coumadin for fistula graft thrombosis.  his INR has continue to
be therapeutic during his stay .
- once INR<2.0 would consider restarting low dose coumadin
.
# Back pain: Cont percocets
.
# HTN: Control BP with lisinopril and hold off on beta blockers.

.
# ESRD: Dialysis M,W,F;
.
# FEN: Renal diet, heart healthy
.
# Prophylaxis:  bowel regimen, INR therapeutic,
.
PT eval: recommends rehab;
