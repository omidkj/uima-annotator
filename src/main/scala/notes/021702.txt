Service:  CARDIAC CARE UNIT

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 59 year-old
male with a past medical history of coronary artery disease
status post myocardial infarction, hypercholesterolemia,
hypertension who presents with 10 out of 10 substernal chest
pain occurring at rest to outside hospital.  The chest pain
began while lying in bed at around 10:15 p.m. associated with
nausea, diaphoresis and radiation to arm and jaw.  He went to
[**Hospital3 1280**] Hospital at 10:30 p.m.  At [**Hospital3 1280**] he had an
electrocardiogram with ST elevations in V2 and V4 of 3 mm and
[**Street Address(2) 4793**] elevations in V4 through V6 with reciprocal ST
depressions in 2, 3, and AVF.  It was normal sinus rhythm at
62 beats per minute.  The PR prolongation at 155.  Vital
signs were stable at outside hospital.  Pulse 54, blood
pressure 109/80, sating 99% on 4 liters of nasal cannula
oxygen.  At outside hospital he received a heparin drip,
nitro drip, aspirin, beta blocker, Integrilin drip and
Retaplase half dose times two, morphine sulfate times three
and Ativan.  He became chest pain free after the second dose
of Retaplase and his symptoms and electrocardiogram changes
had also been resolved on arrival at [**Hospital1 190**] Emergency Room.  Electrocardiogram in the
Emergency Department showed normal sinus rhythm at 82 beats
per minute, PR 106, left axis deviation of .5 to [**Street Address(2) 4793**]
elevations in V2 through V3 with .5 mm elevations in V1, V4
through V5 and resolution of T wave changes in the inferior
leads.  The patient denies any paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea,
orthopnea or exertional angina at workout, but does report
increased fatigue.  Over the last week the patient has
stopped using his statin due to myositis with workouts and
stopped his beta blocker on his own over the past few months.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Coronary artery disease status post
myocardial infarction with lysis with tissue plasminogen
activator in [**2124**], hypercholesterolemia, hypertension.

MEDICATIONS AT HOME:
1.  Aspirin.
2.  Folic acid.
3.  Niacin.

ALLERGIES:  Sulfas.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  He quit tobacco 30 years ago.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  He reports increased fatigue after
workouts last month.  He works out at the gym four to five
times a week with no angina.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  He was afebrile.  Blood pressure
95/51.  Heart rate 62.  Sating 97% on 2 liters of nasal
cannula.  He was in no acute distress lying in bed.
Extraocular movements intact.  Pupils are equal, round and
reactive to light.  Mucous membranes are moist.  Neck was
supple.  No jugulovenous distention.  Heart was regular rate
and rhythm.  S1 and S2.  1 to 2 out of 6 systolic ejection
murmur at the apex.  Lungs were clear to auscultation
bilaterally.  Abdomen was nontender, soft, nondistended with
normoactive bowel sounds.  No clubbing, cyanosis or edema of
his extremities with 2+ dorsalis pedis pulses.  Cranial
nerves II through XII were intact.  He was alert and oriented
times three.  There were no bruits in his groin.

LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION:  White blood cell count 9.2,
hematocrit 47.7, platelets 194, INR 1.1, PTT 25.  Chemistries
139, 3.9, 101, 32, 12, and 1.2.  His CK was 26, 19, ALT and
AST 64 and 334.  Total cholesterol 126, triglycerides 37, HDL
45, LDL 74, TSH 2.1.  Chest x-ray was negative.

The patient was kept on Integrilin and heparin drip.  His
chest pain recurred.  He was taken to cardiac
catheterization, which showed normal cardiac index, mitral
regurgitation, severely abnormal left ventricular ejection
fraction, inferobasal akinesis consistent with remote
inferior myocardial infarction, anteroapical severe
hypokinesis, left ventricular global function depressed, 1+
mitral regurgitation, right dominant coronary angiography.
It also showed a large ectatic proximal left anterior
descending coronary artery with 85% focal severe hazy
stenosis with TIMI three flow.  A stent was placed showing 0%
residual post stent.  There was diffuse ectasia with mild
serial narrowing of the left circumflex on the right coronary
artery.

In summary, the patient was status post anterior myocardial
infarction managed with thrombolysis and then taken to
cardiac catheterization for recurrent chest pain during which
he had a left anterior descending proximal stent placed. He
was continued on Integrilin for 18 hours and recommended to
continue with Plavix for nine months as well as aspirin
therapy.  The patient remained asymptomatic post
catheterization without any arrhythmias.  A repeat
echocardiogram was done showing ejection fraction of 25% with
apical anterior and septal mid septal and basal inferior,
inferolateral and apical inferior akinesis.  The patient was
also evaluated by physical therapy and did well and was
deemed safe to go home.  He was discharged home to follow up
with his cardiologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1295**] on a low sodium diet.  He
was given teaching about a 2 gram sodium diet as well as
cardiac rehabilitation.  He was discharged with instructions
to ambulate 10 to 15 minutes every day, avoid strenuous
activity until seen by his cardiologist.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Myocardial infarction.
2.  Systolic heart failure.

PROCEDURES:  Cardiac catheterization with stent placement.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Good.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Aspirin 325 mg po q.d.
2.  Plavix 75 mg po q.d.
3.  Lisinopril 2.5 mg po q.h.s.
4.  Lipitor 10 mg po q.h.s.
5.  Metoprolol XL 25 mg po q.d.
