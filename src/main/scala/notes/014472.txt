PENDING LABS AT DISHCARGE:
H. pylori serology
.
IMAGING:
[**11-25**] CT ABD/PELVIS TECHNIQUE: MDCT images were obtained from
the lung bases to the pelvic outlet after administration of
intravenous contrast. Coronal and sagittal reformats were
obtained.
COMPARISON: None.
FINDINGS:
CT OF THE ABDOMEN: There is moderate to severe centrilobular
emphysema in the Lung bases. A 3-mm pulmonary nodule is noted in
the left lower lobe (2:4).  The visualized portions of the heart
and pericardium are unremarkable.
The liver enhances homogenously and there are no focal liver
lesions. The
gallbladder, pancreas, spleen, and adrenal glands are
unremarkable. There is a low-density 16-mm well-circumscribed
lesion in the upper pole of the left kidney, most likely
representing a simple cyst. The kidneys enhance
symmetrically and excrete contrast without evidence of
hydronephrosis or
stones. The stomach and small bowel are unremarkable. There is
no free air
or free fluid. Abdominal aorta is normal in caliber.
CT OF THE PELVIS: Though the appendix is not definitely
visualized, a
candidate structure for the appendix is air-filled and appears
normal (2:53).  Scattered diverticula without evidence of
diverticulitis are noted in the sigmoid colon. The remaining
portions of the colon are unremarkable. The rectum, urinary
bladder, prostate, and seminal vesicles are unremarkable.  There
is no pelvic free fluid.
OSSEOUS STRUCTURES: Sacralization of the L5 vertebra is noted on
the left.  There are no suspicious osseous lytic or blastic
lesions.
IMPRESSION:
1. Centrilobular emphysema with a 3-mm left lower lobe pulmonary
nodule.
Followup with a dedicated CT of the chest is recommended.
2. No acute intra-abdominal abnormality.
3. Diverticulosis without evidence of diverticulitis.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 42720**] is a 57-year-old homeless male with history of
polysubstance abuse (cocaine), and seizure disorder presenting
from PCP's office with witnessed syncope.  While on the floor,
he was found unresponsive so a Code Blue was called for possible
seizure activity and he was intubated for airway protection.  He
ultimately left AMA.
.
# Seizures:  The patient was first found to be unresponsive,
then had seizure.  At this time, he was intubated for airway
protection.  Has known history of seizure disorder, reported to
take dilantin at home. On admission, dilantin level negligible,
and was also low with pericode labs. However, a spot EEG was
negative for epileptiform activity. Also on home
benzodiazepines, could be benzo withdrawal.  Finally, he had a
visitor who the nursing staff identified as possible drug user
directly before the seizure activity and the patient admitted to
using something while in the hospital but did not specify what.
Urine tox positive for cocaine.
.
# Bloody vomitus: Patient with multiple episodes of guaic +
maroon vomiting after his seizure.  No known liver disease,
unclear what drinking history is, but patient is polysubstance
abuser.  He underwent an EGD which found only clean based ulcers
and no explanation for the bleeding.  H. pylori serologies were
sent but were not resulted when he left AMA.  He was kept on a
PPI while in house.  After he was extubated, he was complaining
of abdominal pain and was preoccupied with his home opiod and
benzo doses.  It is possible that he was withdrawling from
opiods (chronic methadone at home) and had repeated emesis prior
to seizure which then caused small tear.
.
# Polysubstance abuse: Utox positive for cocaine and methadone
(prescribed).  Once he was extubated and off sedation, he was
restarted on his home doses of methadone and clonazepam (after
about 5 days off these meds) but he was still agitated and
ultimately left AMA.  Also, two drug pipes were found in his
belongings and given to the hospital police.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
- Please follow up H. pylori serologies and start therapy for
gastric ulcers
- Please reassess his needs for housing and substance abu
