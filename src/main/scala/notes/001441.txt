Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Interferon Alfa

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 134**]
Chief Complaint:
shortness of breath, chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
cardiac catheterization
central line placement
Swan-Ganz line placement

History of Present Illness:
79 year old F, hx renal cell CA s/p R nephrectomy and s/p chemo
for recurrence, adrenal insuffiency, anemia with intermittent
outpt transfusions. Pt was admitted to OSH, c/o four days of SOB
and chest pain, palpitations, increased when lying down. Pt had
CXR c/w pulmonary edema, BNP 83K, treated with diuresis BIPAP
with some improvement.
This morning developed chest pain at 10AM, EKG with T wave
inversions, echo performed with LVEF 25%, 3+ MR and 3+ TR (nl
last year), found to have elevation in troponin to 0.09.
Subsequently pt developed AFib with RVR in the 200s, resistant
to small doses of lopressor. Started on heparin qtt, nitro qtt,
given [**First Name3 (LF) **].
Arrived to [**Hospital1 18**], found to have AFib with RVR at 150 bpm,
started on amiodarone, cardioverted to NSR, had cardiac
catheterization showing LCx with large ramus 80% lesion, tx with
BMS x2. LAD with 60% DI lesion, RCA without stenosis.
Aorta: 101/72/84
RV: 42/9/15
PA: 42/27/34
PCwp: 22
CO: 2.88 (CI 1.88)
Upon transfer to CCU patient denies any chest pain, palpitations
or shortness of breath. She attributes the beginning of her
breathing problems to the weight gain she experienced after
starting on hydrocortisone for adrenal insufficiency leading to
15 lb weight gain.

CXR [**4-4**]:
1. Asymmetric pulmonary edema, right greater than left.
2. Left basilar consolidation in the left retrocardiac region
which may represent some atelectasis or edema.
3. Pulmonary artery catheter is directed into left main
pulmonary artery.
4. Residual contrast persisting in the left renal collecting
system and left renal parenchyma - question time of contrast
administration.
.
C. Cath [**4-4**]:
COMMENTS:
1. Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system
revealed
2 vessel coronary artery disease. The LMCA had no
angiographically
apparent flow limiting lesions. The LAD had mild luminal
irregularities
and gave rise to a moderate sized D1 which had a 60% stenosis.
There was
a large ramus which had a 80% ulcerated proximal stenosis. The
LCX did
not give off any other branches. The RCA was a dominant vessel
with mild
luminal irregularities.
2. Resting hemodynamics revealed elevated left sided filling
pressures
with PCWP of 22mmHg with depressed cardiac index and low
systemic blood
pressure.
3. Left ventriculography was deferred.
4  The proximal lesion in the ramus intermedius was predilated
with a
2.5 X 15mm Voyager balloon, stented with overlapping 2.5 X 12mm
and 2.5
X 08mm Minivision (Bare metal) stents with lesion reduction from
80% to
0%. the final angiogram showed TIMI III flow with no dissection
and no
embolisation. (see PTCA comments)
5. On arrival to teh cath lab pateint with in atrial
fibrillation with a
rapid ventricularresponse. She was started on IV amiodarone and
constinued to be tachycardic. ANesthesia was called and she was
successfully cardioverted with 300J-->NSR. She developed AF
again atthe
completion of the procedure with rates of 120-140bpm.
.
0FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Two vessel coronary artery disease.
2.  Elevated left sided filling pressures, reduced cardiac
index.
3. Systemic hypotension.
4. Rapid atrial fibrillation.
5. Successful stenting of the ramus intermedius lesion with bare
metal
stents
.
CXR [**4-5**]: IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**4-4**]:
Pulmonary edema is markedly asymmetric, severe in the right
lung, though improved since [**4-4**], and mild on the left.
Mild-to-moderate cardiomegaly with suggestion of left atrial
enlargement is unchanged. Small bilateral pleural effusions
stable. No pneumothorax. An ascending Swan-Ganz catheter tip
projects over the left descending pulmonary artery. No
pneumothorax.
.
Echo [**4-5**]:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses and
cavity size are normal. There is moderate regional left
ventricular systolic dysfunction with severe hypokinesis of the
inferior wall, mid inferolateral wall, distal half of the septum
and apex . No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) are mildly thickened. There is a minimally increased
gradient consistent with minimal aortic valve stenosis. No
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
structurally normal. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild
(1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary
artery systolic
