History of Present Illness:
69 yo male w/ PMHx of obesity, tobacco abuse, osteoarthritis and
chronic low back pain presenting from rehab with abd pain, SOB
and hypoxia. Pt is s/p L2-S1 decompression and fusion in [**2096**].
After c/o persistent and worsening low back pain pt found to
have new soft tissue mass around L2 on imaging this summer, he
[**Year (4 digits) 1834**] resection with hardware removal and tumor debulking
[**7-3**] with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1352**] with subsequent nerve sheath and
retroperitoneal resection with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1924**] on [**7-14**]. Pathology from
surgery is consistent with sarcoma and high grade malignant
peripheral nerve sheath tumor. The patient was discharged on [**7-19**]
to [**Hospital1 **]. Per the rehab physician the patient had been doing
well post operatively. His primary problem had been pain. His
pain from his incision was well controlled but pt became more
and more constipated in setting of narcotics use resulting in
escalating use of narcotics to treat pain. Both pt and physician
state that pt had been passing some stool. He had no respiratory
complaints and no oxygen requirements until [**Known lastname **] of admission. He
was complaining of abdominal pain and SOB in am, was found to be
cyanotic with 02 sats in low 80s on room air. He reportedly
vomited at rehab and again in ED. He was given meropenem and
vanc this am at OSH.

Upon presentation to ED his were VS in triage: T = 98 120 133/94
30 80% RA. He was initially treated with high dose IV steroids
for a concern for wheezing with a history of reactive airways
disease. He remained hypoxic with 02 sats in low 90s on NRB and
RR into 50s. He was intubated for respiratory failure. Noted to
vomit/aspirate feculent material during intubation. NGT
placement with ~700cc feculent material returned. Pt hypotensive
after intubation, initially given levo for BP 56/42, but
developed AF and a question of VT vs AF with aberrancy. Levo
switched to neo. He was given levaquin and zosyn. His INR was
noted to be very elevated at 18. He had a femoral central line
placed and was sent to CT for CTA/abd for ? PE, PNA and bowel
perforation prior to transfer to the MICU.
At time of transfer his VS 86 112/61 100% AC 80% fi02 PEEP 10.
Rate 14, breathing at 20. In addition to the antibiotics and
pressors the patient received approximately 3.5L fluid and put
out approximately 900cc UOP. Also received versed, fentanyl,
succinylcholine/etomidate, zofran and combivent nebs.

On arrival to the floor pt was initially intubated but awake and
alert. Denied abd pain, endorsed pain at his incision site at
right flank, requesting assistance with repositioning. Indicated
that his SOB started before his vomiting. Nodded that he had
been having BM/flatus for past several [**Known lastname **] but had felt
constipated.

CT L spine/T Spine: IMPRESSION:

1. Less than optimal exam secondary to body habitus and limited
field of
view. Compared to prior exam there is increased size of large
right
paraspinal mass and associated destruction of the adjacent
vertebral bodies
and posterior elements.

2. Paraspinal soft tissue mass contains gas. Superinfection of
necrotic
tissue is not excluded.
.
CTA [**7-28**]:

.IMPRESSION:
1. Interval development of multiple foci of air in the large
right paraspinal
mass, with interal enlargement of the mas and increase in
surrounding fat
stranding. Findings are concerning for infection, specifically
with a gas-
forming organism.
2. Bilateral scattered groundglass opacities, concerning for
pneumonia. Right
lower lobe consolidation may represent pneumonia and
atelectasis. Small right
pleural effusion.
3. Interval increase in size of right paraspinal mass from [**7-7**]. No new
bony destruction to suggest osteomyelitis.
4. Multiple loops of air-filled bowel suggestive of ileus.
5. No evidence of metastatic lesion. Pulmonary opacities do not
have the
typical appearance of metastases though close followup is
advised.

THE BASES), IS UNCHANGED

Brief Hospital Course:
69M with recently diagnosed high grade sarcoma s/p resection
presented from NH with hypoxic respiratory failure, elevated
INR, leukocytosis.  The following is his course by problem.
.
Hospital Course:
##High Grade Sarcoma: This had been recently diagnosed in the
months before admission. The pt is s/p incomplete resection
(done by Drs [**Last Name (STitle) **] and [**Name5 (PTitle) 1924**] in late [**Month (only) 205**]/early [**Month (only) 216**]).
Repeat CT scan one week after admission demonstrated rapid
progression of tumor with increasing size of RP mass.  The pt
was noted to have worsening neurologic function in his LEs with
sensation nearly absent in LLE and mostly absent (to ~knee) on
RLE and motor essentially absent in b/l extremities.  Extensive
discussions were held between [**Month (only) **] spine team, rad onc, medical
oncology (who had not previously been following the patient) and
his family re: tx options.  At the time of transfer from the
MICU, the pt had elected to pursue palliative XRT for tumor
control and possible symptomatic benefit. He initiated XRT on
[**8-13**]. He [**Month/Day (4) 1834**] several treatments, and had severe difficulty
with pain during positioning during the procedu
