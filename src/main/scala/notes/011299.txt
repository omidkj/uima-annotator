Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 594**]
Chief Complaint:
fevers, hypoxia


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
central venous line placement - [**4-4**]
arterial line placement - [**4-4**]
left BKA - [**4-6**]
revision amputation - [**4-8**]


History of Present Illness:
71 M with history of HTN, HL, OSA, s/p unrestrained MVC rollover
on [**2184-3-9**] with TBI, L open ankle fracture, R closed ankle
fracture and dislocation, scalp laceration discharged with
hospital course complicated prolonged intubation, PEA arrest and
apnea post-op requiring tracheostomy placement on [**2184-3-18**].
Underwent PEG placement on [**2184-3-24**] for long term nutritional
needs. Discharged to rehab on [**4-2**] with external fixator in
place on left ankle and open left calcaneal wound s/p
debridement on kefzol and trach collar.  At rehab, spiked
temperature to 102 this morning and ? desaturation to 89%.  Sent
to [**Hospital1 18**] ED for concern of PNA on CXR versus sepsis.
.
In the ED, patient desated to 84% and improved with bagging and
suction.  Concern for mucus plugging. Underwent CXR, CTA chest
and x-ray of right foot.  CTA chest did not show evidence of
PNA, PE.  Patient required paralyzation with vec for CT scan and
subsequently required vent.  Started on zosyn/vanc/levofloxacin
for concern of wound infection and ? PNA.  Because of
ventilatory need, patient was admitted to the MICU.  Prior to
leaving the ED, SBP dropped to 80s and patient was started on
levophed 0.18 with good effect and SBPs up to 112.
.
On arrival to the MICU, patient's VS - T 98.6, HR 85, BP 184/88,
RR 14, O2sat 100% on CMV through trach.  Patient is sedated, but
in NAD

Imaging:
CXR [**4-4**]
PORTABLE AP CHEST RADIOGRAPH: Tracheostomy tube is noted.
Right-sided PICC
line tip projects over the expected region of the distal SVC.
Prominence of the pulmonary vasculature consistent with
pulmonary edema is improved since the prior exam. Left pleural
effusion cannot be completely excluded.  Bilateral low lung
volumes with crowding of bronchovascular markings are noted.
Cardiac silhouette is accentuated by low lung volumes.

XR Left Foot [**4-4**]
FINDINGS: No localizing information was provided with regards to
the site of the patient's infection; however, soft tissue
irregularity is seen along the plantar aspect of the heel but is
incompletely imaged on the lateral.  Hardware obscures the
plantar surface of the calcaneus, limiting assessment for
osteomyelitis in this location. Oblique fractures are seen along
the bases of the second, third, fourth and fifth metatarsal.
Fracture through the tuft of the great toe is also seen. There
is no evidence of hardware-related complication for the external
fixation. The internal fixation devices about the ankle are not
as well seen.
IMPRESSION:
1. Limited study with re-demonstration of the fractures and
external fixation hardware but poor evaluation of the site of
soft tissue infection which is presumed to be the plantar
surface of the heel. If continued clinical concern, consider
alternate imaging modalities.
2. Possible fracture of the tuft of the great toe.

CTA Chest [**4-4**]:
1. Improvement in the previously described bilateral opacities
with a single rounded peripheral right upper lobe opacity, which
may reflect atelectasis or infectious process.
2. Central bilateral ground-glass opacities could be due to
edema, though
infection cannot be excluded.
3. Dense bibasilar atelectasis and simple effusions as before.
4. Anterior third through sixth bilateral rib fractures

CT Head [**4-4**]:
FINDINGS: There is no evidence of hemorrhage, edema, mass, mass
effect, or
infarction. Prominent ventricles and sulci suggest age-related
involutional changes or atrophy. Periventricular white matter
