an asthma "flare" since this am, after appox one week of URI
symptoms with a cough productive of yellow sputum; she

levaquin, combivent nebs and then transferred to the ICU after
very little improvement.
.
In the ICU, she was given very frequent nebs and improved
dramatically. Her peak flow also increased but not to her
baseline so she was called out to the floor.

Pertinent Results:
.
[**2165-7-8**] CXR:  IMPRESSION: PA and lateral chest reviewed in the
absence of prior chest radiographs:

Lateral views suggest some heterogeneous consolidation in the
retrosternal lung and perhaps a smaller region in one of the
lower lobes, superior segment, consistent with pneumonia. No
pleural effusion. Heart size normal.

Findings were discussed by telephone with the emergency room
physician caring for this patient at the time of dictation.
.
[**2165-7-9**] CXR:  IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to 3:23 p.m. on
[**7-8**]:

On this frontal view, lungs now appear clear, but given the
distribution of previously questioned abnormalities in the
anterior midline, lateral view would be helpful to confirm the
absence of pneumonia. There is no pneumothorax or
pneumomediastinum. The heart is normal size.
