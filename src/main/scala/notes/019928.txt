Chief Complaint:
"Stridor and Respiratory failure."

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 105647**] is a 78 y.o. [**Hospital1 100**]-speaking gentleman with h/o COPD
on continuous O2 at 2L (followed by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 1370**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]) who
presented with dyspnea and increasing respiratory distress over
the past 2D with stridorous breathing. This breathing had
worsened over the course of a couple of days with increasing
dyspnea.  He had no associated cardiac findings.
.
In the ED, initial VS were: 97.2 73 154/80 28 100% on RA. Exam
was significant for inspiratory and expiratory stridor, diffuse
wheezing and rhonchorous breath sounds. The pt had an EKG which
showed sinus rhythm with a PVC. His labs were significant for
negative TnT and ABG 7.39/52/188 and lactate of 0.6. BNP was 785
(with no prior values, though documeted diastolic dysfunction on
echo from 08/[**2178**]). The pt received racemic epi x2, solumedrol
and multiple nebs. BiPap was attempted, but the pt did not
tolerate it, so he was put on a non-rebreather. Machidascope was
attempted and epiglottis looked okay, though they were unable to
get a good look at cords before pt pulled out scope. He was
empirically started on vanc and cefepime to cover for suspected
tracheitis. VS on transfer were: 104, 148/64, 29, 95% 11L NRB.
.
On arrival to the MICU, pt with audible inspiratory and
expiratory stridor. O2 sats in mid-90s on non-rebreather, desats
to low 80s on RA. Able to communicate with partial sentences.
Pt's comfort improved with heliox treatment. ENT evaluated and
found small tissue overhang vocal cords, though no occlusion. No
upper AW edema, and anterior vocal cords patent (post. difficult
to visualize).
.
He was extubated yesterday using fiberoptic bronchoscope.  He
was not seen to have any vocal cord obstruction by ENT
evaluation.  On bronchoscopy no evidence of dynamic airway
motion.  He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation.

-h/o hiatal hernia: dx in setting of dysphagia in [**12/2176**] via
double contrast barium esophogram


Social History:
Retired artist(painter). 75-pack-year smoking history (Quit
smoking in [**2152**]). He lives with his wife in [**Name2 (NI) 105646**]. He
immigrated from [**Location (un) 49506**] in 30 years ago. He denies alcohol or
drug use.


Family History:
NC

Physical Exam:
Physical Exam:
Vitals: Last BP in ICU SBP 97
General: Pt with inspiratory and expiratory stridor audible from
hallway. He is able to complete short sentences, and does not
appear to be using accesory muscles. Pt's distress improved with
sleep. Otherwise, alert and interactive.
HEENT: Sclera anicteric, MMM, EOMI, PERRL
Neck: Redundant skin, no LAD, JVD difficult to visualize
CV: 4/6 systolic murmur heard best at LUSB.
Lungs: Clear to auscultation bilaterally, slight end expiratory
wheeze. Enlarged lung fields, mild increased E:I ratio.
Abdomen: Soft, non-tender, non-distended, bowel sounds x4
quadrants, no organomegaly
GU: foley
Ext: Chronic stasis dermatitis on BL shins (to knees),
extremities otherwise warm, well perfused, 2+ DP pulses, no
clubbing, cyanosis or edema
Neuro: grossly normal sensation, 2+ reflexes bilaterally, gait
deferred.

PE on discharge:
No respiratory distress and slight rhonchi in all lung fields,
otherwise speaks in full sentences and is eager to go home

CXR [**10-4**]:
FINDINGS: Since [**2179-10-2**] there are no interval changes
in the lungs.
No new lung opacities of concern. Evaluation of
cardiomediastinal silhouette is limited due to rotation of
patient.
IMPRESSION: No acute intrathoracic process to explain cause for
shortness of breath.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

.
INDICATION: 78-year-old man with COPD presenting with stridor.
Rule out
airway obstruction.

COMPARISONS: CTA of [**2179-8-31**]. Multiple chest
radiographs from
[**2179-9-30**] - [**2179-10-1**].

TECHNIQUE: MDCT of the chest was obtained from the thoracic
inlet to the
upper abdomen with subsequent 1.25- and 5-mm axial and 5mm
coronal and
sagittal reformats. No IV contrast was adnimistered.

FINDINGS:

This study was read in conjunction with multiple radiographs
over the previous two days that show acute variability of
bilateral interstial opacities, likely pulmonary edema.
Heterogeneous ground-glass opacities of bilateral upper lobes,
right greater than left, are compatible with residual pulmonary
edema. Small bilateral layering pleural effusions are new. Mild
atelectasis persists in the both lower lobes, right greater than
left, improved from [**2179-8-31**]. No pneumothorax is
present.

The trachea is patent without focal stenosis, although
examination is limited by an endotracheal tube that terminates 4
cm above the carina. Mild narrowing of the proximal right upper
lobe bronchus, not due to mass or endobronchial secretions is
probably chronic and not necessarily clinically significant.
The remainder of the bronchial tree is normal.
Aortic valve calcification is substantial and may be
hemodynamically
significant. Calcifications of the aortic arch and descending
thoracic aorta are small. Coronary artery calcifications are
extensive and severe. Though this study is not designed for
cardiac evaluation, the heart appears to be of normal size with
normal cardiac [**Doctor Last Name 1754**]. There is no pericardial effusion.
The thyroid is normal. No supraclavicular, axillary,
mediastinal, or hilar
lymph nodes are pathologically enlarged. An orogastric tube is
looped in the stomach. The esophagus appears normal. Though this
study is not designed for subdiaphragmatic diagnosis, the imaged
portions of the liver, spleen, left kidney, and pancreas are
normal.
Degenerative changes of the thoracic spine and cervical spine
are unch
