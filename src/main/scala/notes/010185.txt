Chief Complaint:
dyspnea

History of Present Illness:
77 yo F hx severe AS, CAD, CRI, DM, HTN admitted to OSH on [**3-1**]
w/ acute dyspnea. A chest CT showed airspace consolidation lower
lobes b/l, RM and RUL, as well as small right pleural effusion.
She was started on doxy/azithro, then ctx and avelox for 5days,
then changed to cefdinir for 3 days, and then 2 more days of
avelox.  In total, received 10 d of abx.  Initial BNP [**Telephone/Fax (1) 77706**].
She subsequently developed ARF (cr peaked 5.9), requiring
initiation of HD.  She initially had renal bx on [**3-6**] which was
benign.  While awaiting bx results she was empirically treated
with steroids, which have since been discontinued.  She
continued to have peristent hypoxemia, was treated with BiPAP,
also required pressors, was intermittently on dopamine,
dobutamine, levophed.  Pt was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**3-11**] for
further care.  After admission, she had a trial of diuresis for
hypoxia and concern for fluid overload was resistant to
diuretics, nicardipine qtt, then placed on CVVHD.
Pt has 4L removed yesterday and additional 1L removed today.  Pt
notes fair improvement in her dyspnea.  She has been receiving
BiPAP nightly and high flow face mask during the day, however
today has required continued BiPAP.  She recalls to me very
gradual progression of dyspnea over months, + orthopnea.  Denies
any associated fever/chills or cough.  She denies nausea, had
one episode of vomiting.  No chest or abdominal discomfort, no
palpitations, no diarrhea or dysuria. Her dry weight is 192 lbs,
weight 215 lbs at time of admission to CCU.


Past Medical History:

CT chest without contrast [**3-11**]
CT OF THE CHEST WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: There is dense air
bronchogram containing solid and ground-glass consolidation
involving the right and left upper lobes (right greater than
left), with additional small regions of ground-glass
opacification noted within the right middle lobe and right lower
lobe with scattered nodular opacities present. Additionally,
there are small bilateral simple pleural effusions, right
slightly greater than left, with adjacent compression
atelectasis and/or pneumonia. Airways are patent to the
subsegmental level and no pathologically enlarged lymph nodes
are present, the largest measuring 8 mm in short axis within the
precarinal chain. There is marked underlying cardiomegaly with
left ventricular and left atrial dilatation, as well as
atherosclerotic disease within the coronary circulation, aortic
annulus and aorta. Artifact is noted from the indwelling
Swan-Ganz catheter whose tip is in the right ventricle.

Visualized images of the upper abdomen display a probable small
cyst of the interpolar portion of the left kidney and bilateral
flank edema. No lucent or sclerotic osseous lesions are noted.

IMPRESSION:

1. Multifocal predominantly upper lobe pneumonia, with small
regions of consolidation and compression atelectasis within the
lower lobes. Small right slightly greater than left simple
pleural effusions.

2. Tip of Swan-Ganz catheter is in the right ventricle
.
Chest CT [**3-18**] without contrast
FINDINGS: Since the examination of [**3-11**], there has been
removal of the right-sided central venous access catheter and
placement of a left internal jugular venous access catheter.
There is a new hematoma in the left supraclavicular region which
is incompletely imaged but which measures 3.3 x 4.0 cm in
transaxial dimension in its imaged portion (2:2). An
endotracheal tube terminates above the level of the carina.
Slight stranding extends into the superior mediastinum from the
left supraclavicular hematoma, although there is no evidence of
mediastinal hematoma about the great vessels. The aorta is
normal in caliber and contour with mural calcifications
consistent with
