Shortness of breath

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 74901**] is a 63 year old male with a history of poorly
differentiated non-small cell lung cancer with known metastases
to brain and liver, polycythemia [**Doctor First Name **], and RUE DVT on lovenox
who presents with worsening dyspnea.
.
He was diagnosed with stage IV non-small cell lung cancer in
[**2153-10-11**] and has received cyberknife for brain lesions,
carboplatin, pemetrexed, and PF-[**Telephone/Fax (3) 74902**] as part of a
clinical trial.  He discontinued this trial [**Doctor Last Name 360**] on [**2155-8-6**]
because of clinical (worsening dyspena) and radiolographic
evidence of cancer progression.   He then started a new [**Doctor Last Name 360**],
Alimta, on [**2155-8-7**].
.
His recent history is notable for dsypnea over the last four
weeks that has worsened over the past four days.  He underwent
right thoracentesis on [**2155-8-1**] with removal of 800cc of cloudy
yellow fluid found to be a malignant effusion.  He had some
improvement in his dyspnea as a response but notes worsening
over the past few days, even after starting home O2 (2-4L) on
[**2155-8-7**].  He also notes having subjective fevers and chills and
a nonproductive cough since starting Alimta.  He presented to
the ED because of worsening symptoms.
.
VS on presentation were 97.9 128/60 97 28 94%ra.  He had a CXR
and a chest CTA that was neg for PE but concerning for worsened
pleural effusions bilaterally, lymphangetic spread of tumor, and
a possible post-obstructive pneumonia.  He was given vanc/zosyn
and bronchodilators.  He became increasingly dyspneic and
hypoxic in the ED, satting 87% on ra, and was placed on a NRB
(satting in the 90s and then bipap with significant improvement.
 He was then admitted to the MICU for further management.
.
On arrival, he is with his family and appears comfortable on
bipap.  He has no complaints.
.

3. Status post 12 cycles of pemetrexed 500 mg/m2 D1 of 3 week
cycle. Started in [**2154-1-8**] (attained partial response). Last
dose
of pemetrexed [**2154-9-10**].
4. Status post 9 cycles of PF-[**Telephone/Fax (3) 74902**] mg [**Hospital1 **] as part of
clinical trial DFHCC 06-068. Started in [**2154-11-29**] (attained
partial response) and had RECIST-based progression in
[**2155-6-5**].
Continues to take study drug.

IMAGING:
.
CTA [**2155-8-10**]:
1. No evidence of PE.
2. Bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left,
slightly increased in size since the prior study.
3. Increase in encasement of the right-sided airways by soft
tissue density, likely representing tumor, with areas of
increased consolidation in the inferior aspect of the right
upper lobe and right middle lobe likely due to post-obstructive
pneumonia, although increased tumor burden cannot be excluded.
4. Diffuse bronchovascular and septal thickening consistent with
lymphangitic spread of tumor.
5. Stable left lower lobe lung mass.
6. Stable diffuse bony metastases and hepatic metastases.
.
ECHO [**2155-8-11**]:
The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thickness,
cavity size and regional/global systolic function are normal
(LVEF >55%). There is no ventricular septal defect. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are
normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but
aortic stenosis is not present. Trace aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
.
CXR [**2155-8-13**]:
IMPRESSION: Relatively stable radiographic examination with
slight
accentuation of the interstitial markings most notably on the
right. There is suspected mild volume overload on the background
of lymphangitic
carcinomatosis. At least partially loculated left pleural
effusion again
re-demonstrated.
.


Brief Hospital Course:
63 year old man with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer
admitted with dyspnea 1 week following right sided thoracentesis
for pleural effusion, found to have reaccumulated pleural
effusion on x-ray.
.
Hypoxia: The pt was initially on non-rebreather in the ED, and
was weaned to BiPap in the ICU. On [**8-12**] am the pt was noted to be
stable on 4L nasal cannula oxygen, and he did not have to go on
bipap again. Dyspnea was most likely due to fluid reaccumulation
and progression of cancer, however vanc/zosyn was started for a
7 day course for possible post-obstructive pneumonia. On [**8-12**] pt
had a right thoracentesis with 1200 ml serous fluid removed. On
[**8-13**] pt had a left thoracentesis with 500 ml removed. Pt will
likely need pleurex catheter on the right if fluid reaccumulates
again. Pt tolerated both procedures well, and was transfered to
OMED on [**8-13**] with intervent
