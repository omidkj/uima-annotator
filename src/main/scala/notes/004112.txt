History of Present Illness:
81 yo M w/h/o CHF w/EF 22%, CAD, CABG x2, complete AV block with
DDD Pacer presented to his Cardiologist's office, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
on [**5-9**] with increasing DOE. His lasix was increased from 40mg
daily to 80mg daily without improvement in DOE. Over the past 2
days PTA pt noticed increasing DOE with limitation in
ambulating. At baseline pt can walk ~1block and can go up 5-7
stairs without SOB or having to stop secondary to fatigue or
SOB. Pt denies any CP/Palpitations or SOB at rest. Pt also
denies PND, and orthopnea.
.
Pt presented to ED with increasing DOE. In [**Name (NI) **], pt was hypoxic
with O2Sats 86%RA, BNP [**Numeric Identifier 27074**], CXR c/w mild pulmonary edema. Pt's
O2 Sats did not improve on 4LNC-sats remained 86% on 4LNC. Pt
was then started on BIPAP, O2 sats improved to 100%.
Approximately 1 hour after presenting to ED received 80mg IV
Lasix x1, and ASA 600mg PR. Pt's VSS at that time 112/66 88 RR
36 100%Sats on BIPAP, with 400cc UOP. Pt was to be started on
Nitro gtt but due to BP 94/50 was held. Pt's SOB improved, BIPAP
removed and placed on NRB with 100%sats, comfortable breathing,
and transferred to CCU for closer monitoring.
.
On further ROS: Pt denied any constitutional symptoms, no
F/C/Cough. No dysuria, no hematuria, no diarrhea, no BRBPR. No
LH/Dizziness-had 1 episode 2 weeks ago of LH and fatigue while
gardening. Has not had any recent recurrence of LH/Dizziness.
Denies any testicular pain, no penile discharge, itchiness or
discomfort (completed course of levofloxacin for testicular
infection)

Pertinent Results:
[**2124-5-10**] CXR:
IMPRESSION: Cardiomegaly and findings consistent with mild
congestive heart failure
.
[**2124-5-11**] ECHO:
Conclusions:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated.
The inferior vena cava is dilated (>2.5 cm). Left ventricular
wall thicknesses
are normal. The left ventricular cavity is mildly dilated. There
is severe
global left ventricular hypokinesis (ejection fraction [**10-6**]
percent). No
masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. There is no
ventricular
septal defect. The right ventricular cavity is dilated. Right
ventricular
systolic function appears depressed. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Moderate
(2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Moderate to severe [3+]
tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. Significant pulmonic regurgitation
is seen. The main pulmonary artery is dilated. The branch
pulmonary arteries are dilated. There is no pericardial
effusion.

Tissue velocity imaging and tissue synchrony imaging
demonstrates < 50 msec opposing wall delay to peak velocity in
all apical windows (dyssynchrony not present).
.

Brief Hospital Course:
AP: 81 yo M w/CAD, s/p CABG, HTN, CHF p/w CHF exacerbation and
respiratory distress
.
#. CHF exacerbation: Pt's CHF exacerbation most likely in
setting of increased fluid intake due to testicular infection.
Pt presented with worsening SOB with recently increased Lasix 80
mg PO daily without improvement in symptoms. EF 22% on P-MIBI,
no recent ECHO. Received 80 mg IV Lasix in ED with good UOP >800
cc UOP, off BIPAP on NRB w/100% O2 sats. In CCU he received
another 80IVLasix x1 with his cardiac meds, including Carvedilol
12.5, lisinopril 5mg and Dig 0.125. His SBP dropped in to the
70s. Pt was asymptomatic, however MAPs dropped to 40s. SBP
minimally improved with 100cc IVF bolus. Pt was started on Dopa
gtt and subsequently started on lasix gtt for better perfusion
and diuresis. Pt diuresed well with -1L per day. He was noted to
have severely depressed EF on ECHO 10-20% with 3+TR, 2+MR,
Moderate Pulmonary Regurg. He was also noted to have elevated
PAD pressures, elevated PCWP 26. With lasix gtt, Wedge decreased
to 18, Dopa was weaned off on [**5-13**] as well as lasix gtt. His
BB/ACE-I/Dig were held while on Dopa gtt. He was further
diuresed on furosemide 80 mg po qd.  Eventually his dose was
further decreased to 40 mg po qd with ins and outs remaining
roughly even. He will be discharged on furosemide 40 mg qd. His
respiratory status improved during his hospitalization.  He was
encouraged to use BiPAP at night to augment his respiratory
status.
.
#. CAD: Pt denies any CP/palpitation. No indication of ischemia
on ECG or with CE. CE remained Negative. He was continued on low
dose ASA, and statin. Patient needs to have follow-up with
cardiology.  Would have PCP recommend [**Name Initial (PRE) **] local out-patient
cardiologist to follow the patient.  He should see cardiology in
[**1-21**] weeks.
.
#. Rhythm: NSR, v-paced. Had an episode of VT on Tele. On ECHO
no dy synchrony noted. Pt with DDD Pacer. No further episodes.
.
#. RESP: Pt with persistent respiratory acidosis with initial
ABG 7.27/70S/90S. Noted to have elevated PaCO2. Upon arrival to
CCU remained on NRB while diuresing. Pt was started on BIPAP the
following morning for the above notable ABG. A respiratory
consult was obtained for his respiratory hypercarbia. Per PCP pt
noted to have empyema as child with restructured R-sided
pulmonary anatomy. R-sided parenchyma with pleural thickening.
He was aggressively diuresed with improvement of respiratory
status ABG improved 7.40/56/121, the Lasix gtt was turned off
and continued on Lasix IV. Patient developed metabolic alkalosis
in response to his ongoing respiratory acidosis.  Patient was
encouraged to wear his BiPAP at night and while napping,
however, he often refused as he does not like the machine. Would
continue to encourage use of BiPAP.  Patient should follow-up
with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 575**] in the pulmonary clinic.  He has an
appointment for [**2124-7-17**] but the clinic will call him if an
earlier appointment becomes available. A sleep study can be
arranged to evaluate for sleep apnea after he has been
officially seen in the pulmonary clinic.
.
#. HTN: Baseline SBP low 100s. Reinitiated BB, ACE-I and
titrated as BP tolerated once off the dopamine drip.  Patient
had SBPs in low 100s during most of his stay.  He was discharged
on carvedilol 6.25 mg [**Hospital1 **] and lisinopril 7.5 mg QD. Meds,
particularly the ace inhibitor, should be titrated up if blood
pressure tolerates.
.
# Testicular infection: Pt had recently completed 1 week course
levofloxacin for testicular infection. He remained afebrile,
normal WBC, testicular exam normal. Spoke with PCP which
confirmed the 1 week course of ABX. Urine culture was negative.
No additional antibiotics were administered during his stay.
.
#. CRI: Cr baseline 1.7-2.0, currently at 1.8. Renally dose
meds, avoid nephrotoxins
Follow UOP and Cr and electrolytes weekly while taking
furosemide.
.
# Gout: Had been allopurinol as an out-patient, which was not
continued during his admission. Developed some R great toe pain
on [**5-17**] and was started on colchicine for symptom control ([
