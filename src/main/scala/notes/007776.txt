Service: Neurosurgery

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 78 year-old
woman who was observed by her husband to slump over while
doing the dishes and became unresponsive.  She was
unresponsive at the scene and was intubated, sedated and
transferred to [**Hospital1 69**] where a
head CT showed diffuse subarachnoid hemorrhage with
ventricular dilatation.  Blood pressure range was 64 to 180
on an off Nipride, pulse was 40 to 60, intubated and sedated.
Pupils were 2.5 mm and briskly reactive, face was symmetric.
She had positive dolls eyes, positive corneal, positive gag,
minimal withdraw and flexion in the upper and triple flexion
in the bilateral lowers, the toes were mute, reflexes are 2+
bilaterally.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Hypertension.
2.  Diabetes.
3.  Asthma.

LABORATORY:  White blood cell count 9, hematocrit 36.2,
platelets 278, sodium 141, K 4.1, 105/27, 16/.8 and 157.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the Intensive
Care Unit for close observation and then taken to angio where
she was diagnosed with bilateral posterior cerebral artery
aneurysms, which were coiled with good occlusion.  The
patient tolerated the procedure well and was taken to the
Intensive Care Unit post coiling.  The patient was
unresponsive on Propofol.  She was intubated, off sedation,
she remained unresponsive.  Pupils are 1.5 bilaterally with
minimal reaction to light.  No corneal.  No cough to deep
suctioning.  She was flaccid times four in all extremities to
painful stimuli and she was not breathing over the
ventilator.  The following day her pupils were 1.5
bilaterally with no reaction.  She had negative dolls eyes.
She had positive gag.  She withdrew to pain in the upper
extremities and minimal triple flexion in the lower
extremities.  Head CT showed coil artifact with no obvious
new hemorrhage.  On [**2145-8-26**] the patient made the family a
DNR, although her condition had been unchanged and spiked a
temperature to 101.9 on the 29th.  Klebsiella and H flu was
cultured from her sputum.  She was started on Vanco, Levo and
Gentamycin.  On the 30th she opened her eyes half way,
grimaced symmetrically localizing on the right upper, left
upper had trace movement to pain, withdrew minimally to the
pain in the lower extremities.  A head CT showed a right
thalamic infarct.  She remained with a drain in place at 15
cm above the tragus.  On [**2145-9-1**] she had an episode
where she dropped her pressure.  An echocardiogram on the
30th showed an EF of greater then 75% with an outflow
obstruction and trivial mitral regurgitation.
Electrocardiogram was normal sinus rhythm.  [**2145-9-1**] she had
an electrocardiogram changes.  CPKs and enzymes were sent.
She had a positive troponin at .27.  Cardiology was consulted
due to the fact that the patient could not have heparin.
There was little, but blood pressure control, the patient
could have from a cardiology standpoint.  Medically the
patient's condition continued to wax and wane.  She ruled in
for a large myocardial infarction.  She developed a clot in
the left IJ, which did not require any treatment.  She
continued to have difficulty weaning from the ventilator and
went into respiratory distress on [**2145-9-5**].  She also had
severe leukocytosis and ultimately when into renal failure
requiring dialysis.  She coded on [**2145-9-12**] and was chemically
coded without success and the patient expired on [**2145-9-12**].
