Brief Hospital Course:
53 year old female with a history of chronic pancreatitis s/p
whipple complicated by multiple biliary strictures s/p dilation
and tube changes who presented this morning for elective IR
cholangiogram to assess stricture and developed mild hypotension
post procedure.
.
Hypotension: Patient's blood pressures primarily in the 90s
systolic with good urine output, no lightheadedness or dizziness
and mentating well. No evidence of bleeding post-procedure. Most
likely related to medications given periprocedure.  We feel that
instrumentation infection (?transient bacteremia) versus
hemorrhage are much less likely given that her Hct was stable
and WBC trended down. She is currently afebrile and abdominal
pain is well controlled.  She does not need antibiotics as of
now.
- She will follow up with her gastroenterologist and PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] 2
weeks.
.
Abdominal Pain: Patient developed pain post-procedure which is
different from her typical pain. Is worse on the right side and
radiates to the back. This rapidly corrected and was well
controlled on home regimen for pain.
- She should not drive on narcotics and we recommended colace
while taking narcotics for pain.
