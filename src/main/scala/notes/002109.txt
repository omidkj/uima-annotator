Chief Complaint:
Recurrent falls

Transbronchial nodal biopsy

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is an 82 yo female with PMH  significant for HTN and
HLD who initially presented from OSH on [**5-20**] with 3 week history
of multiple falls, approximately once per week. She had an MRI
which showed 4 enhancing cerebellar lesions, thought to be
consistent with metastatic cancer. She was transferred to the
oncology service for further work-up.
She underwent a CT scan chest at OSH (read by our
radiologists)which showed a RUL lung mass with mediastinal
lymphadenopathy. She was started on Decadron and Keppra. She was
transferred to the IP service for further work-up. on [**5-24**] and
underwent a transbronchial nodal biopsy. She acutely became
hypertensive and tachycardic causing her to go into flash
pulmonary edema. Initial EKG showed ST depressions inferiorly
and laterally. She received Nitropaste, Lasix, and was started
on a Labetalol gtt. She was taken to SICU and placed on BIPAP
with little improvement in her respiratory status. Repeat ECG
showed ST elevations in V2 and V3 and post-procedure cxray
showed moderate R sided pneumothorax. Chest tube was placed and
she was intubated. During her stay in the MICU her hypoxia
slowly improved with diuresis. Cardiology was consulted and did
not feel that she was having an ACS. ST elevations resolved and
she was transferred back to the oncology service.

Relevant Imaging:
1)LE doppler ([**5-23**]): 1. No deep vein thrombosis in the lower
extremities.

2)ECHO ([**5-23**]): No obvious vegetations visualized. Mild focal
hypertrophy of the basal septum with normal biventricular
systolic function. Mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
No pathologic structural valve disease. If  clinically
indicated, a TEE may better assess for evidence of endocarditis.


3)ECHO ([**5-24**]): There is symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
The left ventricular cavity size is normal. LV systolic function
appears depressed with spetal akinesis/hypokinesis and anterior
hypokinesis (views are suboptimal). Overall LV ejection fraction
estimate is ?45%? Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is
seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.

4)CT Head ([**6-5**]): Bilateral cerebellar masses with no evidence
of hydrocephalus or herniation.

5)CT Chest ([**6-5**]): 1. Multifocal pneumonia/aspiration, greater
in the left lower lobe than the right lower lobe. Right lower
lobe opacities are more rounded in configuration and underlying
nodules are not excluded. There is no dominant lung mass
visualized. 2. Small peripheral centrilobular nodular opacities,
sub-5-mm in size. These may be inflammatory, but it is unclear
if these preceded the current pneumonia as no prior CT exams are
available for comparison. 3. Several small mediastinal lymph
nodes, and more infiltrative opacity of the left hilum. While no
single node meets CT size criteria for pathologic enlargement,
metastasis may be resonsible.
4. Right adrenal mass, not characterized on this study. 5. Lytic
lesion of the left T10 pedicle. Bone scan could be obtained if
indicated for further evaluation. 6. Fracture of the right
posterior eighth, ninth, and tenth ribs.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 82yo female who presented with multiple falls,
found to have multiple brain lesions now s/p transbronchial
biopsy complicated by respiratory failure, pneumothorax, and
STEMI.

1)Respiratory distress: Occurred in the setting of malignant
hypertension during the bronchoscopy causing her to go into
pulmonary edema. In addition, she was found to have a R sided
pneumothorax secondary to bronchoscopy but she did not require a
chest tube. As a result of her hypoxemia, she was found to have
ST depressions and then elevations, likely demand ischemia.
Patient was intubated and then extubated successfully. Upon
transfer to the oncology service, she was diuresed further but
given mild improvement in her respiratory status a CT scan chest
was done. CT revealed multifocal opacities. She was started on
Vancomycin & Zosyn for presumed hospital aquired pneumonia and
the pulmonary service was consulted. The pulmonary team agree
with our plan and further diuresis was held. During the
remainder of her hospital stay her respiratory status
significantly improved, only requiring 2-3L supplemental oxygen
at time of discharge. Repeat cxray confirms this as well. PICC
line was placed and she will need 2 week course of Vancomycin &
Zosyn (last day [**2102-6-19**]). Patient was also started on Bactrim DS
for PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 1102**]. PICC line should be removed once
antibiotics are completed.

2)Brain lesions: Patient initially presented with multiple falls
and found to have multiple lesions on imaging. Likely metastatic
cancer but no primary found thus far. Tissues obtained during
bronchoscopy was nondiagnostic. Patient and family are still
unsure about brain biopsy and further work-up will be deferred
as outpatient once her respiratory status improves. She was
started on Keppra on admission which was titrated up to 1000mg
[**Hospital1 **]. She was also placed on Decadron. Both medications should be
continued as an outpatient, as per her oncologist.

3)Hypertension: Patient found to have extremely elevated SBPs
s/p bronchoscopy. This likely caused her to flash causing her
respiratory decline. She remained hypertensive throughout her
stay in the MICU and required her to be on a nitro gtt for
better blood pressure control. She had been on an extensive
regimen in the MICU which was changed upon transfer to the
oncology service since she had not been able to take PO. She was
placed on Lopressor 5mg IV which was changed to PO prior to
discharge. Low dose Lisinopril 5mg was also started.

4)SIADH: Throughout the first part of her admission patient
maintained normal sodium. After her return from the MICU she was
hypernatremia and her free water deficit was appropriately
corrected. For the remainder of her stay she has remained
hyponatremic. The etiology was thought to be hypovolemic given
poor oral intake. As a result, she was hydrated with IVFs. Urine
electrolytes and osmolality were checked and confirm diagnosis
