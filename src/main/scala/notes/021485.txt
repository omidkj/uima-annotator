Pertinent Results:
Conclusions
Pre-bypass: The left atrium is moderately dilated. No
spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the
left atrium or left atrial appendage. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. There are focal calcifications in the aortic arch.
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. The
number of aortic valve leaflets cannot be determined. The aortic
valve leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. There is
critical aortic valve stenosis (valve area <0.8cm2). No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are moderately
thickened. There is mild valvular mitral stenosis (area
1.5-2.0cm2). Mild to moderate ([**2-11**]+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

Post-bypass: The patient is not receiving inotropic support
post-CPB. There is a well-seated bioprosthesis in the aortic
position with good leaflet excursion. There is no paravalvular
or transvalvular regurgitation. The mean transvalvular pressure
gradient is 6 mm Hg with a cardiac output of 2.2 L/min.
Biventricular systolic function is preserved and all other
findings are consistent with prebypass findings. There is an
ascending aorta tube graft. All findings were communicated with
the surgeon intraoperatively.

Brief Hospital Course:
[**8-6**] Ms.[**Known lastname **] was taken to the Operating Room and underwent
aortic valve replacement( CE #21 mm pericardial valve) and
replacement of the ascending aorta ( #24 mm Gelweave)with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 914**]. Please refer to his operative report for further
details.

She tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to the
CVICU in stable condition on  phenylephrine and Propofol drips.
She awoke neurologically intact and was extubated without
incident on POD#1. Electrophysiology ( Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 73**] was
consulted for a junctional rhythm postop as well as her
recurrent atrial fibrillation. She was cardioverted on [**8-10**] and
was converted to sinus rhythm.  She was started on Amiodarone. A
right chest tube was placed on [**8-12**] for a recurrent pleural
effusion, and then removed on [**8-16**]. A PICC was placed for venous
access.  She was gently diuresed toward her preop weight.

She transferred to the floor on POD # 9 for further monitoring.
Physical Therapy was consulted for strength and mobility
evaluation. Her rhythm developed pauses while on Amiodarone and
she continued to alternate in and out of  rate controlled atrial
fibrillation. Amiodarone was discontinued and she was placed
back on her home dose of Sotalol.  Anticoagulation was resumed
with Coumadin.  She developed a right forearm phlebitis and was
started on Kefzol briefly. This continued to improve over the
next few days and antibiotics were stopped.  Her white count
remained elevated without evidence of infection and then fell.
She was cleared for discharge by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  All incisions were
clean and healing well.

She was discharged to [**Doctor Last Name **] [**Hospital **] Rehab on [**8-24**].  All follow up
appointments, precautions, medications and restrictions were
given. The INR goal is 2-2.5 and an INRwill be needed on [**8-25**]
with target INR 2.0-2.5.
