Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2297**]
Chief Complaint:
Transfer from OSH for sepsis.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation.
ICU procedures including central venous line placement, arterial
line placement, hemodialysis.

History of Present Illness:
61 y/o M with PMH DM, obesity, PMR on chronic prednisone,
?paroxysmal afib who initially presented to [**Hospital3 51058**] at
01:45 this am with shortness of breath.  [**Name (NI) 1094**] wife states that
the pt began feeling sick yesterday with chief complaint of
"chest congestion" with chills, increasing weakness, and
increased productive sputum with cough, no fevers.  The pt's
wife states that he had been experiencing ?increasing myalgias
over the last several days which he attributed to worsening PMR
and had been increasing his usual doses of prednisone.  The pt
normally takes 50 mg of prednisone and the wife counted his
pills this morning and believes he has taken approximately 360
mg of Prednisone over the last 2 days(she states that he often
increases his prednisone by himself to alleviate his pain).  She
reported that he was weaker over the last 2 days and fell 3
times yesterday with increasing disorientation.  Last night, the
pt's breathing became more labored and the wife states that she
"couldn't get him out of bed" and called EMS.
.
In [**Hospital3 **], pt presented with worsening dyspnea.  VS
according to records (very scant) show T 101.7, BP 70/34, P140,
R 26, Sat 94% NRB.  Pt was given Ceftriaxone 2 g IV, Tylenol,
Azithromycin as well as 3 L NS.  The pt stated he was DNI at the
OSH and refused intubation.  Despite low BP, pt was not put on
pressors secondary to episode of rapid afib.  EKGs at [**Hospital1 15331**]
show sinus tach at 140 bpm with no ST changes and also separate
EKG with afib with HR 174 bpm.  ABG on 100% NRB was 7.25/64/76.
Labs were remarkable for wbc of 2.5 with 40% bands, Hct 34.2,
plt 258, BUN creat 19/1.2, BNP 259, Trop I 0.08(indeterminate),
CK 43.
.
On arrival to [**Hospital1 18**], arrived as EU critical, pt had O2 sats of
80% NRB, SBP 60-70 systolic.  Code status was reversed by pt to
full code after discussion with ED staff that condition may be
reversible.  Pt was quickly placed on peripheral dopamine while
being intubated and received Ativan for sedation.  Received
Vancomycin and Levaquin as well and IVF wide open.  Femoral TLC
was placed urgently.  Initially placed on Levophed but HR
increased to 190 in afib, SBP dropped to 50s -->pt received 2
shocks at 300, 360--> SBP improved to 70 and HR improved to 110.
 Pressors changed to neo briefly but given persistent
hypotension, now on both Neo +Levophed.  CXR with opacifiedL
upper and lower lobes, small L effusion; lactate 2.1.  Pt
admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for further management.
.
On arrival to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], has gotten a total of 8 liters of NS, urine
output has been 100cc.  Patient weaned from neo, now on
levophed.

Past Medical History:
1) DM
2) Obesity
3) Polymyalgia rheumatica - wife states that this was diagnosed
2 yrs ago and he has been on Prednisone since then with steadily
escalating doses, now on 50 mg daily alhtough taper has been
attempted in the past; she states that she thinks pt is
"addicted" to prednisone
4) ?paroxysmal afib - "racing heart rate" treated with Sotalol
5) has been hospitalized 4x in the past year, once for DM, and
another for "blood clot" in leg (was on blood thinner for some
time but no longer on med)

Social History:
He lives with his wife at home; prev tob use 1ppd x 22 yrs, quit
18 yrs ago, no EtOH, no IVDA.  Wife [**Name (NI) 1258**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 66194**],
[**Telephone/Fax (1) 66195**].

Family History:
Not contributory.

Physical Exam:
Afebrile BP 113/60 HR 110 on Levophed at 0.2 mcg/kg/min
Vent AC 100% FIO2/PEEP 10/TV 600/rate 20
Gen: sedated, intubated
HEENT: pupils equal, round, sluggish but equally reactive
Neck: supple, no LAD, JVP could not be assessed secondary to

Microbiology:
[**3-23**] Blood culture: negative.
[**3-24**] Urine culture: negative.
[**3-23**] Sputum culture:
      >25 PMNs and <10 epithelial cells/100X field.
      4+ GRAM POSITIVE COCCI IN PAIRS AND CLUSTERS.
      1+ GRAM POSITIVE ROD(S).
      Coag positive staph aureus resistant to penicillin,
sensitive to other antibiotics.
[**3-23**] Viral screen: negative for influenza A, B, adenovirus, RSV,
and parainfluenza 1,2,3.
[**3-24**] Urinary legionella antigen: negative.

Imaging:
[**3-23**] CXR:
1. Multifocal airspace opacities, most pronounced in the left
mid lung.
.
[**3-23**] ECHO:
The left atrium is normal in size. The right atrium is
moderately dilated.  There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Due to
suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality
cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is probably severely depressed (probably globally) but
views are technically suboptimal (estimated ejection fraction
?35-50%). The right ventricular cavity is dilated. There is
severe global right ventricular free wall hypokinesis. The
aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened with no significant mitral regurgitation detected in
suboptimal views. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be
determined. There is no pericardial effusion.
.
[**3-23**] LE U/S:
Findings consistent with chronic left popliteal thrombosis.
Lumen remains
partially patent.  Acute thrombosis is less likely but cannot be
completely excluded.
.
[**3-23**] CTA:
1.  Extensive consolidation of the left upper and lower lobes.
Multifocal
opacities in both left lobes and right upper, middle, and lower
lobes.  Small left pleural effusion and smaller right pleural
effusion.
2.  No pulmonary embolism.
3.  Coronary vascular calcifications.
.
[**3-23**] CT abdomen/pelvis:
1.  Narrowing of the celiac axis with soft tissue stranding.  No

atherosclerotic plaque seen in this region.  These findings are
more
indicative of vasculitis than of atherosclerotic narrowing.
2.  Lack of opacification of renal collecting system indicating
renal
failure.
3.  No evidence of acute bowel pathology.
4.  Large consolidation of left upper and lower lobes, with
multifocal
airspace opacities in both lungs.


Brief Hospital Course:
61 y/o M with history of DM, PMR on high dose prednisone,
paroxysmal a-fib admitted with likely sepsis secondary to
pneumonia as well as rapid atrial fibrillation possible
pulmonary embolus, now intubated, on max doses of neo and
levophed s/p cardioversion.
.
# Respiratory Failure:
This was thought to be secondary to a multifocal pneumonia seen
on CXR.  There was initial concern for PCP given his history of
high dose steroids but his initial CXR was thought most
consistent with a community acquired pneumonia.  There was also
concern for a PE given his history of blood clots and the fairly
acute onset of symptoms but this was ruled out by a chest CTA on
admission.  Cultures were negative except for coag negative
staph in his sputum.  He was treated initially with broad
spectrum antibiotics including vancomycin, levofloxacin, and
ceftriaxone and this was transitioned to oxacillin alone on
[**3-26**].  He was covered empirically for PCP with Bactrim given his
steroid abuse at home.  He required ventilatory support until
[**3-30**] when he was extubated.  He tired quickly and required
re-intubation later that
