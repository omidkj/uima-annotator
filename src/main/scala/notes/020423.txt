Service:  O-Medicine

CHIEF COMPLAINT:
Shortness of breath.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 77 year old
male with a stage IV nonsmall cell lung cancer and asthma,
who was requiring two liters of nasal cannula at home times
one year, but started complaining of dyspnea and began to
have an increased oxygen requirement, four liters.  Two days
ago, he noticed four out of ten chest pressure times two
minutes at rest and worse with activity.  Chest pressure is
without any radiation or associated nausea, vomiting or
diaphoresis.  The patient also has had a cough times one year
with clear phlegm production.  The patient has had diarrhea
times one week without evidence of any blood.  His shortness
of breath was better with standing but worse with activity,
like walking or taking a few steps.  He denies any fevers,
chills, sweats, abdominal pain, dysuria, or tuberculosis
exposure.

In the Emergency Room, the patient was started on a
nonrebreather and then changed to BiPAP but he was changed
back to a nonrebreather because he did not tolerate BIPAP.  A
chest x-ray was done which showed a left pneumothorax.
Cardiothoracic surgery was consulted and a chest tube was
placed.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Hypertension; transthoracic echocardiogram from [**2163-11-14**] showed a left ventricular ejection fraction greater than
60%, diastolic dysfunction.
2.  Status post left nephrectomy and partial bladder removal
for renal cell cancer 50 years ago.
3.  Asthma.
4.  Stage IV nonsmall cell lung cancer diagnosed in [**2160**],
bilateral disease without extra-thoracic disease.  Patient is
status post carboplatin and Navelbine times five which led to
seizure-like activity.  The patient is also status post
IRESSA times two months and Taxotere times five treatments
from [**2164-11-13**].

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Fentanyl patch 200 mcg q.72h.,
roxicodone one to two teaspoons 5 mg/5 ml p.r.n., Ambien 10
mg p.o.q.h.s.p.r.n., Hytrin 5 mg p.o.q.h.s., Flovent two
puffs b.i.d., Ventolin two puffs q.4-6h.p.r.n., Cardizem 120
mg p.o.q.d., aspirin.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient has occasional alcohol use.  The
patient is a five to ten pack year smoker, quit 50 years ago.

FAMILY HISTORY:  There is no family history of lung cancer.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On physical examination, the patient
had a temperature of 98.9, blood pressure 140/80, pulse 78,
respiratory rate 20 and oxygen saturation 96% on four
liters.  Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat:  Moist mucous
membranes, pupils equal, round, and reactive to light and
accommodation, extraocular movements intact, oropharynx
clear.  Cardiovascular:  Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1
and S2, no murmur.  Chest:  Decreased breath sounds,
increased tympany on left side.  Abdomen:  Soft, nontender,
nondistended, positive bowel sounds.  Extremities:  2+
pitting edema in lower extremities bilaterally.

LABORATORY DATA:  White blood cell count 4.4, hematocrit
36.8, platelet count 210,000, sodium 140, potassium 4.5,
chloride 103, bicarbonate 30, BUN 16, creatinine 1, glucose
104, calcium 8.2, phosphorous 4.2, magnesium 2, CK 75,
troponin less than 0.3.

RADIOLOGIC DATA:  Chest x-ray:  Large left sided pneumothorax
with minimal right tracheal shift.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient is a 77 year old
African-American male with stage IV nonsmall cell lung
cancer, who presents with acute dyspnea secondary to left
pneumothorax.

1.  Pulmonary:  As already noted, the patient had a chest
tube placed by cardiothoracic surgery.  Several days later,
the patient was still noted to have an air leak even though
his chest x-ray showed signs of improvement in terms of his
pneumothorax.  The patient was transferred to the
cardiothoracic surgery team for bleomycin pleurodesis.
However, on the night prior to the procedure, [**2165-4-30**],
the patient was noticed to have an increased oxygen
requirement and noted to be acutely short of breath with use
of accessory muscles.  He was requiring six liters of oxygen
via nasal cannula.  The patient was initially thought to be
having a congestive heart failure exacerbation and was given
Lasix.  An echocardiogram was performed which showed normal
left ventricular size and function, however, it was a limited
study.  With this episode, the patient was ruled out for a
myocardial infarction.  The patient was transferred to the
Medical Intensive Care Unit for further management.

The patient's hypoxia was thought to be multi-factorial.  The
patient was noted to have left lower lobe and lingular
infiltrates and there was some concern for aspiration
pneumonia.  The patient was started on a one week course of
levofloxacin.  There was also concern that the patient was
having increased secretions and mucus plugging, for which he
received regular standing chest physical therapy.  The
patient's diagnosis of asthma is somewhat unclear and he may,
in fact, have chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.  The
patient was continued on albuterol and Atrovent.  He was also
continued on fluticasone.  It is possible that some of the
patient's bronchospasm in response to nebulizers may be
secondary to lymphangitic spread of his cancer.

On [**2165-5-1**], the patient finally received his bleomycin
pleurodesis treatment.  That evening, he was noted to once
again be hypoxic at 86% on four liters, with an increased
work of breathing.  The patient's pCO2 increased from 28 to
58.  The patient was transferred back to the MICU after
spending a couple of days on the O-Medicine floor.  The
patient was continued on the seven day of levofloxacin.  At
this point, the patient was started on Solu-Medrol, even
though the patient was thought to be mucus plugging.  In
order to maximize the effects of the bleomycin, it was
decided to keep the patient on a quick taper of steroids.

On [**2165-5-2**], the patient was still noted to have an air
leak.  He was transferred back to the O-Medicine floor.  At
this point, there was a decision to be made about whether or
not to perform further pleurodesis, possibly with talc versus
the placement of a portable valve such as a Heimlich valve.
Given the patient's poor pulmonary reserve, repeat
pleurodesis was thought to be unwise.  However, there was
large concern about the patient and his wife's ability to
maintain and care for the Heimlich valve.  The patient became
very irate about staying in the hospital.  On [**2165-5-8**],
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 954**] placed a Heimlich valve.  The patient went home
the following day with VNA services.

2.  Renal:  The patient was noted to have an increase in his
creatinine up 1.4.  This was thought to be secondary to
receiving Lasix for what was thought to be an exacerbation of
congestive heart failure where, in fact, the patient was
probably actually dry, with a metabolic contraction
alkalosis.  Eventually, once the Lasix was stopped, the
patient's creatinine came down to 1.2.

3.  Psychiatric:  The patient was sun-downing at night.  He
was kept on narcotics.  He received Zyprexa at night.  He
briefly was also receiving Ritalin and Celexa, although this
was thought to be hurting rather than helping.

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  Good.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
Fentanyl 200 mcg t.d.q.72h.
Roxicodone one to two teaspoons 5 mg/5 ml p.o.p.r.n.
Ambien 10 mg p.o.q.h.s.p.r.n.
Hytrin 5 mg p.o.q.h.s.
Flovent two puffs i.h.b.i.d.
Salmeterol two puffs i.h.b.i.d.

Cardizem 120 mg p.o.q.d.
Prednisone 40 mg p.o.q.d. times three days, then 20 mg p.o.
times three days, then off.

FOLLOW-UP PLANS:  The patient was instructed to follow up
with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4149**].  The patient will go home with
VNA services.  The patient will also likely follow up with
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 954**] for his Heimlich valve.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Left pneumothorax, status post chest tube placement,
status post Heimlich valve placement.
2.  Hypoxia, likely secondary to mucus plugging, pneumonia,
bronchospasm.
3.  Status post bleomycin pleurodesis.
4.  Hypertension.
5.  Stage IV nonsmall cell lung cance
