IMPRESSION: Appearance is similar to prior study with mild basal
atelectasis on the left and small right effusion in addition to
mild increased interstitial markings peripherally in the right
lung and at the left lower zone, which may reflect underlying
interstitial disease, possibly with mild superimposed edema.


Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 96986**] was taken to the operating room by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on
[**2106-2-5**] for right thoractomy and tracheoplasty with mesh, right
main stem bronchus/bronchus intermedius bronchoplasty with mesh,
left main stem bronchus bronchoplasty with mesh, and
bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage, for her
tracheobronchomalacia. The patient was extubated in the OR, and
transfered to the PACU for recovery then to the SICU for further
management that evening. The patient had epidural with
bupivicaine and dilaudid for pain management. The patient was
transferred to the floor in stable condition on [**2106-2-7**] (POD 2).
The following is a systems review of her hospital course.

Neurologic: The patient had a bupivicaine and dilaudid PCA which
was effective in pain control. Acute pain service managed this
until it was discontinued on POD 3. The patient was transitioned
to tylenol, ibuprofen, oxycodone, and lidocaine which was
effective. She is also on home gabapentin. She remained
neurologically intact. Of note she admits to former narcotic
addiction, therefore care will be made to assist in titrating
off oxycodone after the immediate postoperative period.

Pulmonary: The patient was brought out of the OR with a right
[**Doctor Last Name **] chest tube which was removed on POD 1 without pneumothorax
on postpull film. Aggressive pulmonary toilet was instituted
with around the clock mucolytics, nebulizers, and incentive
spirometry. The patient was kept on her home inhalers, and home
bipap. She also remained on oxygen via nasal canula 4L during
the day. At night she used her home bipap. Pulmonary was
consulted and followed alongside. The patient had desaturations
during the night on bipap therefore her nightly oxygen was
increased to >92% with 6L. Two doses of lasix were given POD 3
and 4 for pulmonary congestion and to diurese after the initial
fluid given postoperatively. CXR's were followed.

CV: The patient remained hemodynamically stable throughout her
stay in NSR.

Abd: The patient was advanced to a regular diet which she
tolerated. Stool softeners were given. The patient passed gas
and was close to having a bowel movement on date of discharge.

GU: A foley was kept during the epidural and dc'd POD 3 with
good urinary response thereafter.

ID: The patient remained afebrile with CBC trends followed.
There were no infectious processes during the stay.

Prophylaxis: Heparin was given for DVT prophylaxis.

Dispo: PT evaluated the patient on POD 4 and deemed the patient
would benefit from a short stay in rehab, which the patient
would also like.

The patient was ambulating with PT, tolerating a regular diet
with pain controlled on an oral regimine. Her oxygen on 4L nasal
cannula was 95%. The patient was deemed stable for transfer to
rehab on [**2106-2-11**].
