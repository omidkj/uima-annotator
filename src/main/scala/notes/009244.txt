Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1515**]
Chief Complaint:
Worsening shortness of breath for 6 months

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Transcatheter Aortic-Valve Implantation (CoreValve)

History of Present Illness:
Mrs [**Known lastname **] is a 65 year old woman female with h/o CAD/CABG, DM,
CHF, CVA, COPD, who is admitted to the CCU POD #1 following
CoreValve placement for critical Aortic Stenosis.
.
History obtained from OMR. Patient was diagnosed with AS at age
15. In the past 3-5 years she has developed progressive symptoms
of dyspnea and chest pain. She is primarily bed-bound, with
ambulation limited to ~ 10 feet without shortness of breath. In
the past a few weeks, with mild exertion, patient also felt mild
midsternal chest pain, described as "burning", with no
radiation. On admission she denied history of syncope.
Recent ECHO [**2132-4-25**] reveals LVEF 60% aortic valve area of
0.7cm2, mean gradient 81mmHg, and jet velocity of 5.5 m/sec.
Patient was evaluated by cardiothoracic surgery, and was deemed
high risk candidate for surgery and she was enrolled into the
Corevalve trial. Today, she was taken to the OR for CoreValve
placement under general anesthesia. Access through the right
femoral artery was obtained with a 18F sheath. A temporary pacer
wire was placed. Balloon aortic valvuloplasty was performed and
a 29mm Corevalve device was deployed. In the proceedure, the
patient developed hypotension to SBP 89 and was given IVNS, and
briefly on phenylephrine, intra operative HCT was 29.9 (down
from 32.3) she was transfused one unit PRBC. In total, she
received 3500cc IVNS intra operatively. Other medications given
intraop included Furosemide 80mg IV, cefazolin 2g, and
Vancomycin 1.5g. Following the proceedure, the patient was
transferred to the CCU for close monitoring.
The patient was received intubated in the CCU vitals were T:
97.1 BP 147/73 P:87 SaO2 97%, vent settings AC Vt600, rr16 Peep5
100% FiO2.

PERTINENT STUDIES
# [**5-26**] Cardiac Cath
COMMENTS: Ascending aortogram was obtained using a sizing
Omniflush
catheter at 14/14 LAO/[**Last Name (un) **] projection to ensure that all the
cusps were
at the same level. Thereafter a 5 Fr sizing pigtail catheter was
used to
obtain the distal aortogram with visualization of bilateral
ileofemoral
arteries to assess feasibility of femoral access. At the end of
the
procedure TR band was applied to the left radial access site
with
excellent hemostasis. No immediate complications.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Sinus of Valsalva diameter 30 mm ( adequate for Corevalve
placement)
2. Bilateral iliac and femoral diameter > 8 mm with minimal
tortuosity
3. Minimal aortic regurgitation by supravalvular aortography
.
# [**5-26**] CXR
IMPRESSION: PA and lateral chest reviewed in the absence of
prior chest
radiographs, but read in conjunction with CT imaging of the
chest on a torso CT examination performed elsewhere on [**2-1**]:

Pulmonary vascular plethora, mild interstitial abnormality,
moderate-to-severe cardiomegaly and pulmonary arterial
dilatation are all unchanged since [**Month (only) 958**].  There is no
pneumonia, interstitial pulmonary edema or pleural effusion. The
extent of central adenopathy and of calcification in the aortic
valve is much better demonstrated on CT images.
.
# [**5-27**] ECHO (TEE)
Pre valve implantation study
Very poor image quality overall.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is
mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. Regional left
ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There are simple
atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. The aortic valve
leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. There is criti
