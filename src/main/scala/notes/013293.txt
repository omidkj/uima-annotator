Imaging:
Head CT([**9-26**]):
IMPRESSION: Extensive intracranial hemorrhage including a large
subdural
hematoma centered around the inferior aspects of the left
temporal lobe in the middle cranial fossa and extending along
the lateral aspects over the parietal convexity as detailed
above. There are scattered subarachnoid hemorrhage and at least
one focus of apparently intraparenchymal hemorrhage. No definite
intraventricular hemorrhage identified. No hydrocephalus.

Head CT([**9-27**]):
IMPRESSION:
1. Status post left frontoparietal temporal craniectomy with
subdural
hematoma evacuation and expected postoperative pneumocephalus
and subcutaneous gas.
2. Decrease in size of subdural hematoma, with residual
subarachnoid
hemorrhage in a pattern similar to the preoperative study.
3. No increase in degree of mass effect or shift of the midline
structures to the right.
4. Right frontal approach craniotomy site, with catheter tip
terminating in gyrus in the right frontal lobe.

Head CT([**9-28**]):
IMPRESSION:
1. Status post left frontoparietal craniectomy and subdural
hematoma
evacuation, with improved edema and mass effect.
2. No new or enlarging hemorrhage. No significant change in
appearance of
multifocal subarachnoid hemorrhage and subdural hemorrhage.
3. Unchanged appearance of subtle subcortical white matter
hypodensity in the high right frontal lobe, which may be related
to small vessel ischemic change.

Head CT([**9-30**]):
IMPRESSION:
1. While brainstem evaluation is limited by motion artifact,
there is a small central hypodensity in the medulla (2b:34) that
could be due to an infarction vs artifact. Further evaluation
may be performed by MRI.
2. Unchanged subarachnoid and intraventricular hemorrhage.

Head CT([**10-1**]):
IMPRESSION:
1. Unchanged appearance of extensive subarachnoid hemorrhage,
multifocal
parenchymal hemorrhages, and intraventricular hemorrhage. No
evidence of new supratentorial abnormalities.
2. Multiple apparent hypodensities in the medulla and pons may
be
artifactual. If there is a persistent clinical concern for an
acute
infarction, further evaluation may be performed by MRI.

T/L-Spine CT([**9-27**]):
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of acute fracture or malalignment abnormality of
the thoracic or lumbar spine. Lumbar spondylolysis as described,
with limited evaluation of intrathecal contents on CT.
2. Scattered irregular and round-like consolidations and
ground-glass change in the right upper and lower lobe. In the
setting of a large axial hiatal hernia and intratracheal
secretions, these findings are worrisome for aspiration.
3. Extensive bilateral pleural calcifications.
4. Mild dilatation of the left renal pelvis, even proximal left
ureter, of
unknown chronicity, but no obvious obstruction is seen.
5. 4-mm left lower lobe pulmonary nodule. In the absence of
known malignancy or significant risk factors for malignancy,
(i.e., smoking), no further followup is necessary. If these risk
factors or history exists, recommend followup CT in one year to
confirm stability.

MRI C-spine([**9-27**]):
IMPRESSION:
1. Increased signal within the posterior soft tissues in the mid
cervical
region indicating local soft tissue trauma without evidence of
ligamentous
disruption.
2. No evidence of marrow edema or fracture within the visualized
vertebral
bodies.
3. Mild degenerative changes. Coarse slightly limited study by
motion.

Abdominal Ultrasound ([**9-30**]):
IMPRESSION:
1. No definite cause for increased LFTs identified. The liver
echotexture is normal, and there is no intra-hepatic biliary
ductal dilation.
2. Sludge within the gallbladder and proximal common duct,
probably related to n.p.o. status.
3. Passive congestion of the IVC and hepatic veins, possibly
reflecting right heart dysfunction.
4. Calcified granulomas of the liver and spleen.
5. Small left effusion.
6. Cyst of the left mid kidney with a single septation.

Chest X-Ray([**10-1**]):
IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**9-29**]:
No endotracheal tube is seen below C7, the upper margin of this
film.
Nasogastric tube ends in the mid stomach. Right subclavian line
tip projects over the low SVC. Small-to-moderate right pleural
effusion largely loculated at the base and lateral aspect of the
right lung, unchanged. Right basal consolidation, either
pneumonia or atelectasis, which worsened from [**9-27**]
through 8, is stable. Heart is mildly enlarged. Left lung is
grossly clear. Extensive asbestos-related pleural plaque and
calcification is noted.

Lower Extremity Ultrasound([**10-1**]):
Occlusive thrombus in the left common femoral and superficial
femoral veins extending to the level of the popliteal vessels


Brief Hospital Course:
79M med-flight transfer rollover MVA, restrained, with +LOC.
Seen at OSH confused with worsening mental status, was intubated
and sedated for obtundation. Pt is on Coumadin and ASA for
cardiac hx and DVTs, unknown INR at OSH, but patient received 3
units of FFP in transit to [**Hospital1 18**] for further managment. GCS<8 on
arrival. OSH head CT showed a SAH and an acute SDH measuring
6-7mm. A repeat head CT was obtained in the ED, which showed
expansion of the left SDH to 1.1 cm, as well as progression of
his SAH.

He was noted that he appeared weaker on the right side, and
given this physical finding as well as his expanding SDH on CT,
he was taken emergently to the OR for subdural hematoma
evacuation by hemicraniectomy. He also had [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 8745**] bolt placed
for ICP monitoring. He tolerated the procedure well and was sent
to the trauma ICU in stable condition, still following some
simple commands post-operatively. A post-op head CT showed  a
decrease in size of subdural hematoma, with residual
subarachnoid hemorrhage, same as pre-op. Also showed no increase
in degree of mass effect or shift of the midline structures to
the right. CT and MR imaging of the spine was obtai
