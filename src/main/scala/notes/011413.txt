CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
Reason: ?ptx
[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
75 year old woman with s/;p cabg
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
?ptx
INDICATION: 75-year-old woman with status post CABG; evaluate
for pneumothorax.
COMPARISON: [**2144-7-7**].
SINGLE AP UPRIGHT RADIOGRAPH OF THE CHEST AT 7:40 A.M.: There
are moderate bilateral pleural effusions, slightly worse than
prior study. There are associated bibasilar opacities which are
also worse and may reflect worsening atelectasis and/or
pneumonia. Left PICC is terminating at the upper SVC. There is
no pulmonary edema or pneumothorax.
IMPRESSION: No pneumothorax. Worsening moderate bilateral
pleural effusions and bibasilar consolidation.

CT ABDOMEN W/O CONTRAST  [**2144-7-8**] 4:38 PM
CT ABDOMEN W/O CONTRAST; CT PELVIS W/O CONTRAST
Reason: r/o retroperitoneal bleed with drop in hct
[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
75 year old woman with s/p cabg
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
r/o retroperitoneal bleed with drop in hct
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.
HISTORY: 75-year-old female after cardiac surgery with falling
hematocrit and concern for retroperitoneal hematoma. The patient
has known right groin hematoma after removal of a femoral
catheter.
COMPARISON: Right groin ultrasound [**2144-7-1**].
TECHNIQUE: MDCT axial images of the abdomen and pelvis without
oral or IV contrast. Coronal and sagittal reformats were
obtained.
CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: The patient is status
post sternotomy. There are small bilateral pleural effusions and
atelectasis of much of both lower lobes. Diffuse body wall edema
is noted. There are scattered pockets of ascites within the
abdomen. A drainage catheter enters the left upper abdomen and
terminates near the inferior liver edge. Evaluation of the solid
abdominal organs is limited without IV contrast. There is a
small subcentimeter hypodense focus of the left hepatic lobe,
too small to characterize. Gallbladder is not seen and may be
surgically absent or collapsed. Both kidneys are atrophic. The
pancreas, spleen, and adrenal glands are unremarkable. There are
numerous colonic diverticula, but no evidence of acute
diverticulitis. Oral contrast from prior examination is present
throughout the colon. There is no evidence of retroperitoneal
hematoma. There is extensive body wall edema.
CT OF THE PELVIS WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: Again seen is a large
right groin hematoma, which extends down the medial leg.
Assessment for change in size compared to recent ultrasound is
difficult due to differences in modalities. Today on greatest
axial dimension dimensions, it measures about 17 x 6 cm. The
hematoma has high-density component, suggesting more recent
hemorrhage. The bladder is decompressed by a Foley catheter. The
rectum, uterus, adnexa, and pelvic loops of bowel are
unremarkable.
BONE WINDOWS: No concerning bone lesions are seen. There are
degenerative changes of the spine. There is an old wedge
compression fracture deformity of L2 with hyperdense material
within it, probably from vertebroplasty.
IMPRESSION:
1. Right groin hematoma redemonstrated. Assessment for change in
size is difficult due to differences in modalities compared to
prior ultrasound [**2144-7-1**]. Maximal axial dimensions today are
17 x 6 cm. Presence of hyperdense material within the hematoma
suggest more recent hemorrhage into the hematoma. If clinically
indicated, further evaluation with a followup ultrasound to
assess for pseudoaneurysm is suggested.
2. Anasarca evidenced by small bilateral pleural effusions,
scattered pockets of intra-abdominal ascites and diffuse body
wall edema.
3. Atelectasis of a large portion of the lower lobes.
4. Atrophic kidneys.
5. Diverticulosis.

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
75 year old woman with s/p cabg
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
evaluation of rt groin hematoma if changes and evaluation of
flow ? pseudoaneurysm - please compare to previous ultrasound
Right groin hematoma.
COMPARISON: [**2144-7-1**].
HISTORY: Hematoma.
FINDINGS: Panoramic images were obtained of the right groin to
assess the known complex fluid collection. This known complex
fluid collection measures 17.5 x 8.0 x 11.1 cm on today's
examination. Please note however that similar views were not
obtained on prior study and therefore not accurately comparable.
When comparing the most similar views from today's study to
prior study, the dimensions appear slightly decreased when
compared to prior exam. The right common femoral artery and vein
are patent with normal waveforms. There is no evidence of
pseudoaneurysm or AV fistula.
IMPRESSION: Large right groin hematoma, slightly decreased in
size as best can be compared to prior exam.
