History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 78 yo woman with history of COPD, A-fib, CAD s/p
NSTEMI in [**7-/2185**], ruptured RV from pacemaker placement who is
transfered from [**Hospital3 417**] hospital for L colonic bleeding
seen on tagged red cell scan.  She was at [**Hospital1 **]
after a prolonged hospitalization at [**Hospital1 18**] in 6/[**2185**].  She was
discharged on [**Last Name (LF) 4532**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] and at the nursing home was started on
lovenox.  She presented on [**2185-8-23**] to OSH with BRBPR.  She
received a total of 6 U PRBC with Hct trend from 26.9 -> 22 ->
28 (7th U on transfer) and 4 U FFP although INR on presentation
was 1.2.  Gastroenterology apparently defered colonoscopy as
they stated they would not be able to see with all the blood.  A
tagged red blood cell scan showed Left colonic bleeding. She was
transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] for possible IR embolization.
.
Initial vs were: T 98.9 P 101 BP 120/52 R 18 O2 sat 95% on 2L.
Patient was noted to have hct of 22 from 28 with copious
bleeding from rectum so 4 U PRBC were given.  IR, GI, and
surgery were called.
.
Review of sytems:
(+) Per HPI pertinent for BRBPR
(-) Denies fever, chills, night sweats, recent weight loss or
gain. Denies headache, sinus tenderness, rhinorrhea or
congestion. Denied cough, shortness of breath. Denied chest pain
or tightness, palpitations. Denied nausea, vomiting, diarrhea,
constipation or abdominal pain. No recent change in bowel or
bladder habits. No dysuria. Denied arthralgias or myalgias.
.


Past Medical History:
- NSTEMI [**7-/2185**] with unsuccessful PCI of 99% LAD stenosis -
hospital course complicated by ruptured RV from pacemaker
placement with tamponade requiring emergent intubation and
femoral line placement.  Femoral line complicated by arterial
thrombus requiring emergent thrombectomy by vasuclar surgery.
Also treated for VAP during hospitalization.
- Atrial fibrillation
- Mitral valve prolapse

.

.
CXR - R Sided volume loss with flat diaphragms, no infiltrates,
PICC and NG Tube in place.
.
[**2185-7-27**] ECHO: Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size
are normal. There is mild global left ventricular hypokinesis
(LVEF = 45 %). The right ventricular cavity is moderately
dilated with mild global free wall hypokinesis. The mitral valve
leaflets are structurally normal. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation
is seen. Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is
seen. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
.
EKG: a-fib rate 80s, RBBB, TWI in V1-2 unchanged from prior
.
[**2185-8-25**] GI BLEEDING STUDY: IMPRESSION:
No defiinte evidence of gastrointestinal bleeding. Increased
activity within the low abdomen just left of midline is likely
artifactual.
.
[**2185-8-26**] COLONOSCOPY:
Limitations: Poor preparation, therefore, small polyps might be
missed and small AVM might be missed too. when the whole colon,
was reached.
Findings:
 Excavated Lesions Multiple non-bleeding diverticula with medium
openings were seen in the sigmoid colon and mid-descending
colon. Diverticulosis appeared to be of moderate severity.
Impression: Diverticulosis of the sigmoid colon and
mid-descending colon
Otherwise normal colonoscopy to cecum

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 78 yo woman with history of COPD, A-fib, CAD s/p
NSTEMI in [**7-/2185**], ruptured RV from pacemaker placement who was
transfered from [**Hospital3 417**] hospital for L colonic bleeding
seen on tagged red cell scan. She was at [**Hospital1 **] for
rehab after a prolonged hospitalization at [**Hospital1 18**] in 6/[**2185**]. She
was discharged on [**Last Name (LF) 4532**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] and at the nursing home was
started on lovenox. She presented to OSH on [**2185-8-23**] with BRBPR.
She received a total of 6 U PRBC with Hct trend from 26.9 -> 22
-> 28 (7th U on transfer) and 4 U FFP although INR on
presentation was 1.2. Gastroenterology apparently defered
colonoscopy as they stated they would not be able to see with
all the blood. A tagged red blood cell scan showed Left colonic
bleeding. She was transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2185-8-24**] for possible IR
embolization.

1. GI bleed:
Went for IR guided embolization, but unable to locate source of
bleeding. - GI consulted for colonoscopy but [**3-14**] bleeding not
able to scope.  Hct continued to drop Hct 36 -> 30.5 -> 26 and
pt transfused, but repeat Tagged RBC scan negative.  Colonoscopy
showed diverticulosis in the sigmoid colon but no active
bleeding.  Hct stabilized.  Pt was transfered out of the MICU
back onto the medicine floor where her stools continued to be
guiaic negative.   HEr hematocrits were stable for several days
prior to discharge.

2. Wound infection
Pt also has R femoral groin wound s/p R SFA thrombectomy, RLE
fasciotomy, and R femoral and external iliac endarterectomy.
Debrided at bedside and VAC dressing placed. Wound culture
growing pseudomonas and MRSA. Initially started on ciprofloxacin
and meropenum but changed to cefipime [**3-14**] resistence.  Per
vascular,
