History of Present Illness:
This 47 year old woman with no significant past medical history
presented to the ED with 5 day history of malaise, myalgias,
fevers, and gastrointestinal symptoms. 5 days ago she felt
muscle aches through her body, mostly localizing to legs; over
the next few days these aches worsened and she began to become
extremely nauseous with intermittent episodse of non-bilious,
non bloody emesis. Also had several episodes of diarrhea--no
BRBPR or melena. She had subjective fevers and, yesterday, began
to feel short of breath. No CP or diaphoresis.
On presentation to ED, the patient was febrile to 102.7, initial
vital signs were within normal limits but she became hypotensive
to SBP 70's and was not responsive to fluid. Pt also with HR to
140 and RR to 140. Lactate 2.5. Code sepsis called. Pt started
on levophed with good response to fluid, broad spectrum
antibiotics were started. R SC central line placed. Per report,
the patient was very close to being intubated but her
respiratory status began to improve and did not under go this.
BP to 110's on 0.05 of levophed and continuous IVF, lactate to
1.2.
Of note pt reported episode of severe abd pain with radiation to
back. Abd CT performed with no abnormalities revealed. LFT's
w.n.l.
In addition, chest CTA negative for PE.
On admission to MICU, pt reported feeling much better and felt
her breathing was now comfortable. Only complaint was back pain.
On ROS did say she had some headaches the past few days, no
photophobia or neck stiffness. Reported some back pain but no
dysuria, urgency, change in urine color. No vaginal discharge.

Pertinent Results:
EKG: Sinus tachycardia, retrograde P waves, IVCD with slurring
of S waves in precordial leads.

Imaging:
ECHOCARDIOGRAM [**8-18**] - The left atrium is mildly dilated. There
is severe symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with a small
cavity. Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic
(EF>75%), without regional wall motion abnormalities. Tissue
velocity imaging E/e' is elevated (>15) suggesting increased
left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). There is a
severe resting left ventricular outflow tract obstruction, which
further worsens with the Valsalva maneuver.  Systolic anterior
motion of the mitral valve is seen. Right ventricular chamber
size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and
no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are
structurally normal. There is no mitral valve prolapse. There is
systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve leaflets. Mild (1+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is a trivial/physiologic
pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Marked concentric LVH with preserved biventricular
global and
regional systolic function. Severe resting left ventricular
outflow tract
obstruction. Mild pulmonary hypertension. These findings are
suggestive of hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy.


CT CHEST BEFORE AND AFTER IV CONTRAST: There is evidence of
fluid overload, with prominence of interstitial markings. A few
blebs are seen. No pleural effusion is seen. There is bilateral
mild atelectasis in the dependent regions. A single enlarged 10
mm lymph node is seen in the right hilum. The heart is enlarged,
with a prominent left ventricular wall. No pericardial effusion
is seen. There is no axillary lymphadenopathy.

CT ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST: There is periportal edema and edema
in the gallbladder wall, which, in conjunction with the large
IVC, represent recent aggressive fluid resuscitation. No focal
lesions are seen in the liver. The gallbladder, spleen,
adrenals, pancreas, kidneys, are normal. Within the limits of
this non-oral contrast scan, bowel loops are normal. The aorta
is normal in caliber, without evidence of dissection. No
thrombosis is seen within it. There is no free air. No
lymphadenopathy is seen.

CT PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST: Bladder, distal ureters, and uterus
are within normal limits. Bowel loops are also normal, given
lack of oral contrast. There is no free fluid. No free air is
seen. There is no lymphadenopathy.
Bone windows show no suspicious sclerotic or lytic lesions.
Multiplanar reformats were essential in delineating the findings
above.
IMPRESSION:
1. Evidence of fluid overload, probably due to aggressive fluid

resuscitation.
2. Cardiac enlargement, with notably prominent left ventricular
wall. No evidence of aortic pathology.
3. Mild emphysematous changes.

MRI SPINE [**8-22**] - FINDINGS:  From T11-12 to L4-5, no significant
abnormalities are seen.  At L5- S1 level, degenerative disc
disease and mild bulging is seen without spinal stenosis.  There
is no abnormal signal within the vertebral bodies or discs seen
to indicate discitis or osteomyelitis.  There is no abnormal
intraspinal enhancement or fluid collection seen.  There is no
evidence of intraspinal or paraspinal abscess or fluid
collection.  The conus is located at a normal level.
IMPRESSION:  No evidence of discitis, osteomyelitis, or epidural
abscess.  No paraspinal soft tissue abnormalities in the lumbar
region.  Degenerative disc disease and mild bulging at L5-S1
level.


Brief Hospital Course:
1. Septic shock: Pt presented to the ED with hypotension not
responsive to fluids. The pt. was transferred to the ICU and
started on low dose pressors and broad spectrum antibiotics. The
patient was never intubated and her hemodynamic status improved.
Her blood cultrures revealed Strep Viridans infection. The
patient was transferred to the general medicine floor, where she
monitored closely.  She did not have any subsequent
deterioration in her hemodynamic instability and remained
afebrile throughout the remainder of her stay.  She was
discharged with a PICC line for 5 additional days of Ceftriaxone
treatment.
.
2. Cardiomyopathy: A conduction abnormality was noted on EKG. A
subsequent ECHO was done, the patient was diagnosed with HOCM.
The patient's heart function was previously unknown, evidence of
conduction abnormalities on EKG.  An echo was performed on [**8-18**],
with results of above, no evidence of endocarditis.  Her cardiac
enzymes were trended and did not show evidence of ischemia.  The
patient had a periods of tachycardia, with uncertain morphology
(junctional rhythm, left bundle branch block, AVRT) - cardiology
was consulted (see note) and deemed the patient's rhythm was not
WPW and within three days of discharge, beta blockade was
initiated to control her tachycardia, with a dose increase to
Toprol XL 200 qd at time of discharge.  Patient's HR was in the
90s at time of discharge.
.
3) Acute renal failure.  The patient's creatinine elevation
initially dropped within a day of hemodynamic stability and
remained steady throughout the stay, with an elevation to 1.2
with a day of discharge, which was putatively attributed
