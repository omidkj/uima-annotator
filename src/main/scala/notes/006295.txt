Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 3501**] was admitted on [**2138-9-9**] for an elective right total
knee replacement. Pre-operatively, she was consented, prepped,
and brought down to the operating room for surgery. She received
an epidural catheter from the Anesthesia service to manage her
postoperative pain. Intra-operatively, she was closely monitored
and remained hemodynamically stable. She tolerated the procedure
well without any difficulty or complication. Post-operatively,
she was extubated and transferred to the PACU for further
stabilization and monitoring. In the PACU, she had an episode of
apnea possibly secondary to increased narcotics to control her
postoperative pain. She was transferred to the MICU for
monitoring. She was transfused 1 unit of PRBC for postoperative
anemia. She was closely monitored and remained hemodynamically
stable. The following morning, she was transferd to the floor
for further recovery. On the floor, she remained hemodynamically
stable with her pain controlled. She progressed with physical
therapy to improve her strength and mobility. She continues to
make steady progress without any incidents. She was discharged
to a rehabilitation facility in stable condition. She has a
follow up appointment with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on [**2138-9-22**].
