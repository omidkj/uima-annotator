# TRACHEOESOPHAGEAL FISTULA
The patient was transferred intubated from [**Hospital 61603**] Hospital
in NY on [**10-15**] for stent revision to a tracheo-esophageal
fistula.

On [**10-16**] she underwent a CT scan that revealed collapse of the
left lung with partial sparing of the lingula. Left main
bronchus stent was seen in place and was patent, although there
was diffuse attenuation of the airways distal to the stent on
the left, with moderate pleural effusions b/l.

That day she underwent rigid and flexible bronchoscopy with
therapeutic aspiration, BAL of left lower lobe, Balloon
dilatation, left main stem Ultraflex 40 x 14 covered stent, and
left main stem Silicone Y-stent placement.   THe patient
tolerated the procedure well, although she remained with copious
secretions, and so underwent stent revision on [**10-16**] and again
on [**10-18**].

On [**10-17**] she was extubated, which she tolerated well although
with need for frequent suctioning, chest PT, and required
therapeutic bronchoscopy for secretions on [**10-18**].  She was also
maintained on scheduled nebulizers and prednisone.

On [**10-21**] she underwent a Barium swallow to assess for the TEF,
but the patient was unable to complete the study as she
aspirated the Barium during the study.  However, contrast was
seen within the left main stem bronchus and distal airways, most
likely reflecting aspiration although without lateral views,
persistent tracheoesophageal fistula could not be excluded.

On [**10-22**] she had a follow up CXR that revealed: The stent,
central venous access line, and abdominal drain are in unchanged
position. The right-sided basal consolidation has decreased in
extent. The left retrocardiac atelectasis is unchanged. Also
unchanged is still moderate cardiomegaly. Unchanged mediastinal
widening and increase in mediastinal diameter. No newly occurred
focal parenchymal opacities.

# VENTILATOR ASSOCIATED PNEUMONIA
The BAL on [**10-18**] revealed MRSA > 100K, and so the patient was
started on IV vancomycin for a total therapy duration of two
weeks.  She remained afebrile and hemodynamically stable
throughout her stay.

#PLEURAL EFFUSION
On [**10-16**] the patient underwent thoracentesis given radiologic
and clinic findings that was transudative in nature, with
Glucose 214, LDH 170, and total protein of 2.5.   She was also
started on lasix for diuresis.

# HYPERTENSION
The patient's hypertension was eventually controlled through a
combination of clonidine patch, enalapril, labetolol, and
metoprolol.

# ATRIAL FIBRILLATION
The patient has a history of Atrial fibrillation and was
initially placed on IV diltiazem and esmolol for rate control,
which was then converted to PO meds via the PEG; however, her
rate was not controlled until she was digoxin loaded on [**10-19**] and
her rate slowed from AF in the 120s to the 80s.  She was then
placed on her home dose of digoxin 0.125 mg/day, which
controlled her rate throughout her stay.

# ATRIAL THROMBUS
The CT on [**10-16**] revealed a filling defect along posterosuperior
wall of left atrium could represent direct extension of tumor or
intraluminal thrombus.  Given this finding in the presence of
Atrial Fibrillation, she underwent an echocardiogram that
revealed a possible 1.1cm mass in the body of LA,Mild-moderate
mitral regurgitation, Mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension, mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy, but
normal cavity size and global systolic function (LVEF>55%).

She was then placed on therapeutic lovenox for the fibrillation
and the thrombus, and given her history of a TIA, even though
she is at a risk for falls.

# DYSPHAGIA
The patient had a PEG tube placed by IR on [**10-16**] given that she
was intubated for feeding.  She was started on tube feeds [**10-17**],
which she tolerated, and she was kept NPO given that she
aspirated during her [**10-21**] Barium swallow.

# C DIFFICILE
The patient was transferred from [**Location (un) 61603**] with a history of C
difficile diarrhea, and so she was kept on her PO vancomycin.

# ANEMIA
The patient was admitted from [**Location (un) 61603**] with anemia (Hct 26.6),
which has slowly trended down to 23.8, likely secondary to
phlebotomy.  This should be followed in the future, and her
baseline anemia is of unknown etiology.
