History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 5721**] is a 55yo M with history of NSCLC s/p chemo, XRT
and surgery in [**2178**] with post-rad pulm fibrosis, bronchiectasis
and emphysema who presented with hemoptysis. He developed a
cough with frank blood two days prior to admission, and
presented to an OSH for evaluation. There he had stable vital
signs and hematocrit and had a CTA which showed bilateral lower
lobe ground glass opacities, pulmonary herosiderosis vs.
atypical PNA. Patient refused ambulance transfer to [**Hospital1 18**] and

his case with IP for possible bronch. Patient had witnessed
hemoptysis of approximately 200cc of frank blood in the ED and
has 4 units crossed. His hematocrit and vitals were stable with
SBP in the 120s and heart rate in the 90s-100s. His EKG was
unremarkable.  Thoracics wants on west for OR access if
necessary possibly bronch tomorrow or monday. Had 100-200cc

                            **FINAL REPORT [**2183-10-23**]**

   Blood Culture, Routine (Final [**2183-10-23**]):    NO GROWTH.
ECG
Study Date of [**2183-10-22**]  9:36:34 AM
Sinus tachycardia. Baseline artifact. ST-T wave abnormalities.
Since the
previous tracing of [**2183-10-19**] the rate is somewhat faster.
BILATERAL LOWER EXTREMITY VENOUS US: Study Date of [**2183-10-20**] 1:34
PM No comparison is available. Bilateral common femoral,
superficial femoral and popliteal veins show normal
augmentation, compressibility and flow. Bilateral calf veins
show normal flow and compressibility. IMPRESSION: There is no
evidence of DVT in the bilateral lower extremities.

[**2183-10-15**] embolization:
IMPRESSION: Successful embolization of two right intercostal
arteries
supplying lung parenchyma.
Arteriography of the right subclavian artery and right imternal
mammary artery
showed predominantly pleural based hypervascularity, but no
significant
pulmonary parenchymal supply.

[**2183-10-17**] Bronch:
 This procedure was performed in
the intensive care unit.  This was under already obtained
consent of the ICU care.  The patient was correctly
identified in the intensive care unit.  He was sedated with
Versed, propofol, and some fentanyl.  Lidocaine was instilled
through the endotracheal tube.  Next, the currently pre
