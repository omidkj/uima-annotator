MICROBIOLOGY:

IMAGING:
CXR [**9-29**]: Small-to-moderate left greater than right pleural
effusions with multifocal pulmonary opacities.  These findings
are nonspecific and can be seen with a multifocal pneumonia,
aveolar hemorrhage, or massive aspiration.

CT Chest [**9-30**]:
1.  Evidence of mild volume overload with interlobular septal
thickening and bilateral pleural effusions.  Superimposed
diffuse ground-glass opacities not typical in a typical
distribution for pulmonary edema suggest a superimposed process
such as hemorrhage, infection, or drug reaction.
2.  Small bilateral pleural effusions with basilar consolidation
and
atelectasis. Recommend re-evaluation after treatment.
3.  Enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes may be reactive or due to
patient's known MDS. These can be re-evaluated after treatment
with follow-up chest CT.
4.  Coronary artery calcifications of unknown hemodynamic
significance.
5.  Mild splenomegaly.
6.  Cardiomegaly.
7.  Enlarged pumonary artery suggesting pulmonary artery
hypertension.


Brief Hospital Course:
HOSPITAL COURSE:

80 yo female with h/o [**Hospital 90129**] transferred from OSH in [**Location (un) 3844**]
with progressive SOB and hypoxia likely secondary to multifocal
PNA. Her oxygenation improved on broad spectrum antibiotics and
she was transferred to oncology. On the floor her respiratory
status remained stable through day of discharge (94% on 3L). For
her MDS, per primary oncologist baseline WBC 30s, HgB ~8.5, Plt
30s. Initially transfused 3PRBC in ICU with inadequate
responses. She was ruled out for hemolysis. Guaiac was not done
due to lack of bowel movements. On 4th unit of PRBC she bumped
appropriately to HgB 9.6 and then stabilized at HgB 8.5 for
discharge. Platelets trended down to 23. With no guaic
available, she was transfused 1 unit apheresis platelets ([**10-6**])
as a cautionary measure prior to discharge. Creatinine on
admission was found to be 1.6. With improvement of her lung
process it hovered between 1.2 and 1.5. Renal had b
