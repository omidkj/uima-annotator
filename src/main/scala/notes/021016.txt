IMAGING:
CXR [**6-18**]:IMPRESSION:
1. Stable bilateral airspace opacities, in similar distribution
and pattern  compared to prior, worse at the right upper lobe.
2. Central line remains in place.
3. Improved appearance of the right costophrenic angle, with
minimal blunting  of the left costophrenic angle, stable, could
be scarring.
4. No pneumothorax.
5. Stable bilateral rib fractures and incompletely evaluated
sternal
fracture.

CT C/S [**6-13**]:IMPRESSION:
1. Type 3 dens fracture, essentially nondisplaced, with
extension into left  superior facet. Small associated hematoma,
with no significant canal  compromise.
2. Multilevel degenerative changes in the cervical spine. C5-C6
disc
osteophyte complex with mild ventral canal encroachment
(increased risk for cord injury).
3. Extensive biapical opacities and superior mediastinal
lymphadenopathy, incompletely assessed on CT C-spine. For more
details, refer to CT torso

CT TORSO [**2150-6-13**]:IMPRESSION:
1. Bilateral rib fractures.
2. Bilateral focal opacities in the lungs. Given the
distribution, a chronic  condition such as sarcoid is suspected.
Superimposed foci of contusion cannot  be entirely excluded
3. Bilateral small pneumothoraces with signs of tension.
4. Mid-body sternal fracture, with small retrosternal hematoma.
No
pericardial effusion or CT evidence of cardiac contusion.
5. Superior endplate L4 compression fracture.
6. Possible L3 spinal process fracture.
7. Intramuscular hematoma at the right gluteus muscle with foci
of active extravasation.
8. Possible cystic changes at the pancreatic head. Exophytic
cyst off the uncinate process could be side branch IPMN. If
indicated, finding can be further followed with MRI.


Brief Hospital Course:
She was admitted to the Trauma service and transferred to the
trauma ICU for close monitoring. Neurosurgery was consulted for
the Type II dens fracture which was managed non operatively. It
is being recommended that she remain in a hard cervical collar
for at least 6-8 weeks. She will follow up at that time for a
repeat CT scan of her spine.

She was also noted with multiple rib fractures requiring close
respiratory monitoring. A paravertebral catheter was placed
while in the ICU which provided some pain relief. The Acute Pain
Service was consulted for assistance with managing her acute
pain on top of her chronic pain issues. Several recommendations
were made using adjunct therapy.

She was evaluated by Speech for dysphagia and underwent a video
swallow. She is being recommended for a soft diet with nectar
pre-thickened liquids and 1:1 supervision with aspiration
precautions.

She was eventually transferred to the regular nursing unit where
she progressed slowly. She was evaluated by Physical therapy and
is being recommended for rehab after her acute hospital stay.
