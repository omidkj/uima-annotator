Brief Hospital Course:
53 year-old woman with a history of ETOH and tobacco abuse and
prior episode of DTs who presented to [**Hospital3 **] with SOB
transferred for neuro eval now with etoh withdrawal.

#. ETOH withdrawal/tremulousness. The patient was not in DTs but
was high risk given prior history.  She was tachycardic with
tremor and was treated with valium and q1 hour CIWA in ICU.
Social work consulted and she was treated with banana bag and
MVI, thiamine, folic acid. She required valium 100 mg on her
first day, and prior to transfer to the medicine floor require
20 mg po and had a CIWA 8.  She was slowly weaned off CIWA on
the medicine floor, however left AMA on [**8-4**] after refusing any
offer for detox referral.

#. COPD exacerbation/bronchitis. Given SOB and sputum production
along with exam c/w bronchospasm, was treated for COPD
exacerbation with azithromycin, prednisone 40mg.  She was
discharged to complete a course of azithromycin and 8 days of
prednisone 40mg. She was also given inhalers on discharge

#. ETOH abuse. Labs c/f cirrhosis with low plts and elevated
bili.  Would recommend further evaluation as an outpt to confirm
EtOH cirrhosis.  No hepatitis panel on record; would also
recommend obtaining these studies as an outpt. An RUQ US was
performed which showed a large calculus within the gallbladder.
Mild edema in the gallbladder wall, was most likely related to
chronic liver disease.

# Anisocoria: Pt was originally transfered for neurologic eval
for anisocoria and left sided numbness. By arrival her numbness
had resolved. She was seen by neurology in the ED who felt she
had physiologic anisocoria and her neuro exam was stable
throughout course.
