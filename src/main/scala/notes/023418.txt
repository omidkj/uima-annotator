Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 348**]
Chief Complaint:
Hemoptysis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Bronchoscopy with lung biopsy
MRCP


History of Present Illness:
41M with history of deafness who presents with 3-4 months
history of cough, DOE and chest pain and recent episodes of
hemoptysis, found to have large hilar mass on CT.
.
The patient was in his USOH until approximately 3-4 months ago
when he developed a cough productive of white sputum, severe
left-sided chest pain radiating to his back, as well as
progressive dyspnea on exertion. He was seen multiple times in
the [**Hospital6 6689**] ER and diagnosed with pneumonia and
treated with courses of antitbiotics. His symptoms progressed
over the last several months and he lost his appetite and lost a
significant amount of weight. During his last visit on [**2141-8-24**],
he had a Chest CT which revealed a left hilar mass with no
mediastinal LAD. The hilar mass was encasing and narrowing the
left main pulmonary artery and multiple central bronchi and
primary anterior branches. It was suggested that this could be
carcinoma with metastasis.
.
Over the day prior to presentation, the patient developed
hemoptysis, prompting him to return to the ER [**2141-9-1**].  He notes
two episodes, the last of which he produced approximately a
"cupful" of blood clots and bright red blood. According to the
consultation note at the OSH, he estimated that the blood was
approximately half [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 69494**] cup filled with bright red blood. He
was admitted and underwent bronchoscopy on [**2141-9-1**] with biopsy
that presumptively shows small cell lung CA.
.
He describes his chest pain as sharp [**11-14**] left-sided chest pain
that he thought was from a heart attack, though this was ruled
out. This pain is non-exertional and radiates to his back and
abdomen. He reports occasional fevers to above 100, chills and
sweats. He also reports loss of appetite with a 32 pound weight
loss in [**3-10**] months (from 150->118). He also endorses nausea and
vomiting, without hemetemesis. He has occasional upper abdominal
pain. He reports significant fatigue and generalized weakness.
He denies orthopnea, PND, palpitations, edema.

STUDIES:
CTA ([**Hospital1 18**] [**2141-9-3**]): Large left hilar mass extending to the
mediastinum, with narrowing of the pulmonary arteries and left
bronchial branches. Post-obstructive airspace opacity - could
reflect post-obstructive consolidation or though alveolar
hemorrhage is not excluded (givne history of hemoptysis. No PE.

CT ([**Hospital1 **] MC [**2141-9-1**]): Known life hilar mass with question
of lymphangitic spread, low attenuation in the liver, too small
to characterize

Bronch ([**Hospital1 **] MC [**2141-9-1**]): Significant narrowing of the left
mainstem bronchus by extrinsic compression, as well as mucosal
thickening. Mucosa in the LMB was thickend and erythematous and
abnormal appearing. Three need aspirates performed.

EKG ([**Hospital1 18**]): Sinus tach at 100 bpm, normal axis, RAD, non-sig Q
waves in III and aVF, slight ST elevations in V2-3


Brief Hospital Course:
41 yoM w/ 20 pk yr tob h/o, weight loss, night sweats, found to
have large left hilar mass c/w SCLC.
.
ICU Course:
#SCLC -
Patient had bronchoscopy at OSH with biopsy consistent with SCLC
on [**9-1**]. He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**9-2**] for further w/u and
second opinion. At the [**Hospital1 18**], he had a repeat CTA with similar
findings. He had a bone scan with abnormal areas of increased
tracer uptake in the posterior left parietal skull and right
lateral 2nd rib. He had an MRI of his head notable for multiple
enhancing lesions within the brain consistent with metastatic
disease. He was started on decadron per onc/rad onc. He was seen
by Pulmonary who suggested sending sputums for cytology and
treating for postobstructive pna seen on f/u CXR. The slides
from the OSH were received and felt to be c/w SCLC so a family
meeting was held and it was decided to start chemo on [**9-8**] and
proceed with xrt after the 2nd cycle of chemo.

Patient with squamous cell lung cancer with metastases to brain
and pancreas. During [**Hospital 228**] hospital course, tumor spread
very quickly to encompass most of right lung. Patient was then
intubated. Patient's treatment for squamous cell lung cancer was
on hold due to his pancreatitis, ventilator requirement, and
acute illness. Given patient's continued pancreatitis, heme-onc
was again consulted who recommended that chemotherapy would
likely not be an option for this patient due to his continued
illness. Family was made aware of this and preferred that
patient would not receive further treatment.

# Pancreatitis -
Patient had abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. Found to have
elevated amylase and lipase secondary most likely to pancreatic
metastases of his primary tumor. Given the continued elevated
amylase and lipase, hematology-oncology did not believe
chemotherapy would be an option for him. CT abdomen show
diffusely edematous and enlarged pancreas. Ultrasound did not
show any gallstone. His HIV status is negative. He then had a
MRCP that show mass in pancreatic duct.Patient received 4L of NS
on [**2141-9-11**]. He received another 3L this morning. He started to
develop respiratory distress and increasing oxygen
requirement(90% on 2L, 93% on 4L, 90% on FM and then 94% on
NRB). ABG show 7.42/34/64. He was transferred to ICU for
management of respiratory distress.

Medicine service hospital course after transfer from ICU on
[**2141-9-29**]:

# Comfort measures only: patient not in distress,normal resp
rate, did not check daily vitals
Acetaminophen
Haloperidol
Lorazepam
Morphine Sulfate, titrate to comfort
Scopolamine Patch

# Respiratory failure
s/p extubation in ICU, sats low prior to transfer

# SCLC
No treatment options

# MRSA
No antibiotics given goals of care.
