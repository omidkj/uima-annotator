Brief Hospital Course:
Pt was admitted to the SICU on [**3-22**]. He was placed on the
ventilator on arrival. A CT scan was done which showed an
inflammatory phlegmon with no secondary signs of infection. He
was slowly weaned from the ventilator however this required
bronchoscopic clearance of his lungs and aggressive pulmonary
toilet. He was maintained on TPN while his pancreatitis
resloved. Ultimately, he was transitioned to TF and he tolerated
this well. He was maintained on ativan for treatment of his DT
and antibiotics for his pancreatitis. After completing his
course of abx. they were stopped however he began to have
elevated tempuratures and was found to have a recurrent MRSA
pneumonia. He was started on Vancomycin and he is to complete a
14day course for his pneumonia. He achieved his goal of TF and
his TPN was D/C. He began having high stool output. Multiple
samples were sent for C. diff and they were all negative. He was
successfully weaned from the ventilator and tolerated trach
mask. Speech and swallow evaluated him for a Passe-Muir valve.
He was started on lasix for diureses and his sedatives were
stopped. Pt was awake, comfortable, and following commands at
time of discharge. A R PICC was placed on [**4-3**] for continued
antibiotics. He is currently tolerating TF at goal, on trach
mask, and working with PT
