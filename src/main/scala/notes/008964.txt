ADMISSION HISTORY AND PHYSICAL:  Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 54-year-old
female with an extensive past medical history as noted above
who was transferred to the [**Hospital1 188**] on [**2139-3-17**], after she had initially
presented to an outside hospital with complaints of bilateral
buttock pain.  When she was seen and examined at the outside
hospital she underwent CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis
which showed soft tissue air bilaterally extending around the
rectum and into the retroperitoneal tissue.  She was
subsequently taken on that same day for debridement in the
Operating Room and underwent subsequent serial debridements
on [**3-14**] and 22nd.  She remained intubated
postoperatively after this and a repeat CT scan on the 23rd
showed persistent peritoneal gas; therefore, the patient was
transferred to the [**Hospital1 69**] for
further management.

When she arrived at [**Hospital1 69**] her
T-max was 100.1 degrees; otherwise, patient was intubated and
her heart rate was in the 70's to 80's with a systolic
pressure from the 100's to 140's and, as noted, patient was
intubated.  She did respond to voice.  Otherwise she had some
crackles at the bases of her lungs bilaterally.  The heart
was regular.  The abdomen was otherwise soft.  In terms of
the buttocks, there were bilateral 10 cm areas which were
open with pus which tracked deep into the pelvis lateral to
the rectum and, as noted, a significant amount of purulence
was seen.  The extremities were otherwise warm.

In terms of an electrocardiogram from the outside hospital,
it was only notable for sinus tachycardia but no ischemic
changes.  She had a chest x-ray also from that outside
hospital which did not evidence any infiltrate and the CT
scan findings as noted above.

ADMISSION LABORATORY:  When she arrived her white count was
23.1 with an hematocrit of 33.  Otherwise, her electrolytes
were notable for potassium of 4.7, BUN and creatinine of 15
and 0.7.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Given the nature of the patient's extensive
infection, it was determined that she needed to be taken to
the Operating Room somewhat urgently for surgical debridement
of this deep seated infection.  The case was discussed with
the patient's husband who agreed.  As noted on [**2139-3-17**], patient was taken to the Operating Room and underwent
exploratory laparotomy with lysis of adhesions.  A ventral
and umbilical hernia were found which were both reduced and
repaired primarily and sigmoid colostomy was created.  Also a
G-tube and J-tube were placed along with the extensive
debridement of the necrotic tissue.  The patient tolerated
the procedure and there was no note of excessive blood loss.
It was actually estimated to be about 400 cc.  She remained
intubated in the Operating Room and was subsequently taken to
the Intensive Care Unit postoperatively.  Notably, the
Infectious Disease service did consult along the course of
the [**Hospital 228**] hospital stay.

In terms of [**Hospital 228**] hospital course from a neurologic
standpoint, patient did relatively well.  She did have one to
two episodes of mental status changes late in the course of
her hospitalization while patient was on the floor.  These
did actually resolved within just a few minutes of being
re-oriented to her surroundings and were felt to be secondary
to patient's being in a foreign location.  Otherwise, aside
from standard sedation when the patient was intubated and
postoperative pain control with narcotics, the patient really
had no neurologic issues.

From a respiratory standpoint, the patient was, as noted,
intubated when she arrived and actually remained intubated
for some time postoperatively when she was in the Intensive
Care Unit for respiratory support.  It was felt that her
prolonged weaning may have been secondary to the severity of
her infection and it was not until postoperative day five the
patient was actually taken off pressure support and changed
over to CPAP although she did remain on CPAP for some time up
until postoperative day eight when she again required some
additional pressure support which she stayed on until
postoperative day 11 at which time again she was converted
back to CPAP.  By postoperative day 13 the patient was
actually off any additional support which had been keeping
her in the Intensive Care Unit.  Otherwise, she did have some
small pleural effusions develop during the course of her
hospitalization but the time of her discharge patient had no
oxygen requirements, actually satting in the high 90's
without any sort of oxygen support.  On examination there
were only a few crackles at the bases indicating these had
essentially resolved.

From a cardiac standpoint, there was a question of whether
patient had suffered any sort of ischemic event while at the
outside hospital as noted by troponin-I of 0.6 but there were
no electrocardiogram changes and an echocardiogram there
showed preserved left ventricular systolic function.  While
she was hospitalized here she was again ruled out for any
sort of myocardial infarction.  She was otherwise maintained
on beta blockade and by the time of discharge was doing well
on a course of Lopressor 37.5 mg p.o. b.i.d. which allowed
her to maintain rate at around 70 with pressures of 130's
over 70's.

From a gastrointestinal standpoint, the patient's colostomy
that was created did quite well and was viable.  Prior to
discharge the patient's stoma looked viable and was working
well.  She was given Protonix during her hospitalization as
ulcer prophylaxis.  The J-tube that was placed for tube feeds
intraoperatively was removed three days prior to patient's
discharge.

In terms of patient's fluid, electrolytes and nutrition
status, electrolytes were repleted as needed but, notably, in
terms of her nutritional status given the knowledge the
patient would require excellent nutritional support
postoperatively, she did have a feeding jejunostomy placed.
She was actually on total parenteral nutrition
postoperatively and also subsequently given Impact tube
feeds.  We were able to actually conduct calorie counts six
days prior to patient being discharged in order to assess her
meeting adequate nutritional needs.  Given the fact that she
had good p.o. intake we were able to stop the TPN and tube
feeds and patient was able to meet her caloric requirements.

From a renal standpoint, as noted, patient's creatinine when
she came in was about 0.7.  She never really had any episodes
of oliguria or renal insufficiency.  She did quite well in
terms of making urine and mobilizing all the intravenous
fluids that she had been given.  Prior to discharge her BUN
and creatinine were around their baseline at 13 and 0.9.  We
did keep the Foley catheter in place in order to keep the
wound relatively clean.  The patient was relatively
non-ambulatory but otherwise patient had no si
