Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 9002**]
Chief Complaint:
dyspnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
cardioversion, defibrillation

History of Present Illness:
81 yo F with a history of CHF (EF 30%), afib on coumadin, s/p
CABG presents with dyspnea. Last night she began feeling chest
pain that felt "like a [**Doctor Last Name **] in my chest" and noticed her heart
beating quickly. She felt short of breath, weak, nauseaous, with
abdominal pain and "like I was dying". The chest pain and SOB
continued overnight, but the patient is unclear when it started;
she states she has had chest pain at baseline for months.  The
pt's nurse called her in the morning to check in and decided to
call 911.  EMS found pt hypotensive, with pulse in 170s, gave pt
150mg amiodarone and aspirin in the field.
.
In ED, initial vital signs were: 98.8 61/39, 168, 23, 100% on
NRB. In ED appeared uncomfortable, minimally tender in the
epigastrium, found to have maroon guaiac positive stools, 2+
non-pitting edema bilaterally. On EKG appeared to be in
aflutter, given midazolam, cardioverted with 100J initially,
then appeared to go into VTACH, defibrillated with 200J,
converted to NSR. Labs significant for hypoperfusion, CXR
appears to be c/w CHF, pulmonary edema. CTAb showed equivocal
colitis. Covered with vanco/flagyl, got levoflox then developed
a rash so levoflox was stopped. Got 150mg IV amiodarone after
cardioversion, now on amiodarone gtt. Surgery consult for
increased lactate. Cardiology, EP looked at EKG, rhythm strip,
no reccommendations. On transfer, VS were 102/49, P 60, 19, 100%
3.5L. Now has 2 PIVs. Had gotten 1750 cc IVF, 200 cc in foley,
prior to transfer.
.
On the floor, vitals HR 56, BP 86/47, SpO2 99% on 2L NC. Pt felt
tired and had some continued chest pain. On ROS, the patient
denied fever, cough, vomiting, melena, blood in stools. She did
endorse weight loss over the past few months, anorexia X months,
chronic LE edema, constipation (no BM X 5-6 days), a history of
diarrhea with abdominal pain (unclear time course), and a
feeling of increased pressure in her head.  Most recent weights
in clinic about 145 lb. In clinic [**4-29**] c/o decreased urination,
not found to be volume overloaded on exam, BP 80/40 (near
baseline per note). Was found to have elevated Cr and K from
[**4-29**] labs, refused medical intervention and so was treated with
stopping ACE-I and spironolactone and took kayexalate.
.
Pt had extensive discussion concerning code status with PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **].
[**Last Name (STitle) **] (see note in OMR). Briefly, pt has been DNR/DNI for years
and expressed wish to be dead, wants to pass in her sleep. She
clearly does not want any futile aggressive interventions (e.g.
long term supportive care, or intervention if she is "very
sick") but is equivocal about temporary less aggressive
measures; she should remain DNR/DNI per her goals of care.  Full
ACLS resuscitation with CPR / intubation would not be consistent
with her wishes.

IMAGING:
.
CT ABDOMEN: Metallic clips at the GE junction are again noted
with extensive streak artifact which somewhat limits the
evaluation of the adjacent anatomy.  The non-contrast appearance
of the liver is unremarkable. The gallbladder is surgically
absent, with clips in the gallbladder fossa. There is dilation
of the common bile duct which measures up to 23 mm in diameter,
series 301B, image 19, which is increased from previous
measurement of 18 mm at a similar
level. Possibility of a retained stone cannot be excluded.
Correlate
clinically and if needed ultrasound may be obtained to further
assess. The pancreas is atrophic. The spleen is grossly
unremarkable along with both adrenal glands. The kidneys
demonstrate no hydronephrosis or stones. The abdominal aorta
contains atherosclerotic calcification an
