Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] was admitted on [**2179-7-31**] after presenting with new
onset dysarthria.  A code stroke was called and she was
immediately evaluated by the stroke team.  She was admitted to
the SICU after undergoing MRA/MRI which revealed a stroke in the
distribution of the left MCA. There appeared to be shower of
emboli with no major occlusion. She was outside the window to
receive tPA and there was no neurosurgical intervention possible
per the neurology team. A carotid duplex study was performed in
workup of possible etiology, and revealed Left ICA 70-79%
stenosis.  A vascular surgery consult was requested on [**8-3**] for
evaluation and possible surgical intervention.

On [**8-3**], she was seen and examined by the vascular team, who
recommended left carotid endarterectomy during the current
admission.  After discussion of the risks and benefits of
surgical intervention,  Ms. [**Known lastname **] and her husband agreed.  She
underwent left carotid endarterectomy with internal carotid
artery shunting and cerebral oximetry on [**8-3**], and after initial
recovery in the PACU, she was transferred to the vascular
surgery service for further recovery and monitoring.

On [**8-4**], Ms. [**Known lastname **] continued to be hypertensive, requiring IV
nitroglycerin to titrate systolic blood pressure to 100-150.
She was transfused 2 units of pRBCs for post-operative anemia,
which resolved.  She remained otherwise stable, and she was seen
and evaluated by the speech and swallow team, physical therapy,
occupational therapy, neurology, and the [**Known lastname **] surgery
team.  She had daily labs, including tacrolimus levels, and her
medications were adjusted daily according to the liver
[**Known lastname **] protocols.  Her home medications were resumed,
including oral lopressor.

On [**8-5**], Ms. [**Known lastname **] was still requiring a nitroglycerin drip to
maintain target blood pressure, but was otherwise recovering
well from her carotid surgery.  Her neurologic exam continued to
improve, and she was able to use 2 new words.  Her arterial line
was removed, and she was able to be out of bed to a chair.  She
was started on oral hydralazine in addition to lopressor in
order to wean the nitroglycerin drip while maintaining target
SBP.  She was started on aspirin and a statin per the neurology
and [**Known lastname **] teams.

On [**8-6**], Ms. [**Known lastname **] was successfully weaned from nitro at 8am,
and her blood pressure remained stable at goal throughout the
day on her home medications and oral hydralazine.  Her
creatinine continued to trend down slowly at 1.6.  Her Tacro
level was 13.1, and her dose was adjusted accordingly by the
[**Known lastname **] team.  She was tolerating a ground/thin liquid diet,
out of bed with physical therapy, and reported good pain control
on oral pain medications.  Her left neck incision staples were
removed and steri strips applied.  Her foley catheter was
removed, and she voided without difficulty.  She was instructed
to follow up with the [**Known lastname **] service as scheduled, the
neurology stroke clinic on [**10-6**], and the vascular
surgery clinic in 2 weeks.  A packet of lab slips and requests
was prepared by the [**Month (only) **] team and provided to the
rehabilitation facility with instructions.  She will require
daily physical and occupational therapy, speech therapy, and
frequent bloodwork, and has worked with case management to
choose an appropriate acute care rehabilitation facility near
her home.  Ms. [**Known lastname **] and her husband understood and agreed with
the plan, and she was discharged to rehab on [**2179-8-6**] in good
condition.
