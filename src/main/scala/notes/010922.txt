Past Medical History:
ONCOLOGIC HISTORY:
Diagnosed with AML in [**2170-1-21**] when he was found to have low
white count. CD34+, CD13+ with immature AML and had induction
chemo in [**1-/2170**] with 7+3 with cytarabine and idarubicin. He
then had 5 days of mitozantrone/etoposide after biopsy showing
residual leukemia. His cytarabine was held because his cerebral
palsy makes it difficult to follow him for evidence of
cerebellar toxicity. BM Bx on [**2170-3-29**] showed continued
presence of leukemic cells, 60% blasts. Repeat Bx [**2170-4-3**]
showed <5% blasts, but again on [**2170-4-13**] showed residual
disease. In [**5-26**], he had allogenic SCT following BU/CY. He has
been in remission since this transplant, but suffers from
chronic extensive GVHD manifesting as changes in the mouth and
eyes, skin changes, and most recently evidence of vasculopathy
with edema and poor perfusion in the feet.  The patient has been
on a regimen of 15 b.i.d. of prednisone, CellCept at 500 b.i.d.,
and cyclosporine at 75 b.i.d; recently started rituximab.
