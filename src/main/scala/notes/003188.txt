Imaging:
MRI Wand [**2-16**]:
TECHNIQUE: Limited imaging of the brain was performed,
post-contrast, using spin-echo and MP-RAGE sequences.
FINDINGS:
There is a large heterogeneously enhancing lesion, in the left
posterior
temporal and the occipital lobes, extending to the splenium of
the corpus
callosum as well as into the periatrial region, not
significantly changed,
compared to the most recent CT scan allowing for the technical
differences. A few areas of increased signal, in the adjacent
bone, are again unchanged. There is minimal shift of the midline
structures to the right side, not significantly changed.
Continued mass effect, on the atrium and posterior part of the
body of the left lateral ventricle and effacement of the
occipital [**Doctor Last Name 534**] and sulci, unchanged. Pachymeningeal enhancement,
of the tentorium, and the adjacent dura along the
convexity is also unchanged. There is near total/total empty
sella, with no definite pituitary gland visualized, unchanged.
IMPRESSION:
1. Large heterogeneous lesion, in the left posterior temporal
and the
occipital lobes, extending into splenium, with mass effect on
the left lateral ventricle, may relate to glioma/radiation
necrosis, demonstrated for surgical planning, not significantly
changed.

MRI Head(post-op) [**2-16**]:
Comparison is made with preoperative study from [**2131-2-15**].
There are postoperative changes in the left occipital lobe
including a post op cavity. There is some hemorrhage within the
operative bed. There is residual enhancement in the left
occipital lobe and temporal lobe with
enhancement extending into the splenium of the corpus callosum.
There is a
small amount of restricted diffusion along the margins of the
ostoperative
cavity and within the enhancing tumor mass in the temporal lobe.
This could represent foci of acute ischemia. There is dural
enhancement in the left hemisphere which is likely postoperative
in nature. There is a small subgaleal fluid collection on the
left. Intracranial flow voids are maintained. There is bilateral
mastoid opacification.

Pathology [**2-15**]:
DIAGNOSIS:
   I.  Foreign body:
Gross examination only.
  II.  Brain, left occipital, resection (A):
Glioblastoma, WHO grade IV (See note).
 III.  Brain, left occipital, resection (B-M):
Glioblastoma, WHO grade IV (See note).
IV.  Brain, left occipital, resection (N-O):
Glioblastoma, WHO grade IV (See note).

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient was electively admitted on [**2-15**] for excision of
recurrent mass in the left occipital lobe. She was monitored
post-operatively in the ICU overnight. After an uneventful stay,
she was transferred to the neurosurgery floor. Prior to
transfer, MRI was performed showing expected residual mass.
Physical and occupational therapy were consulted and determined
her to be an appropriate candidate for home with her family and
outpatient services, and she was discharged on [**2-20**] with follow
up arranged.
