HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 77-year-old
gentleman with an extensive history of coronary artery
disease (status post multiple myocardial infarctions) who was
transferred from an outside hospital for cardiac
catheterization.

The following history is per the patient's daughter; as the
patient only speaks Portuguese.  She reports that the patient
had increasing shortness of breath with exertion over the
week prior to admission.  At 1 o'clock a.m. on the morning of
admission, the patient awoke from sleep with acute shortness
of breath.  He decided to present to an outside hospital.  At
approximately 7 o'clock a.m., while driving to the hospital,
the patient developed chest pain.

At the outside hospital, the patient was pain free after
receiving oxygen.  He was found to have a troponin of 76.3, a
creatine kinase of 501, and a CK/MB of 20.8.  The patient was
given a heparin bolus, and the decision was made to transfer
the patient to [**Hospital1 69**] for
cardiac catheterization.  At that time, the heparin was
discontinued and the patient was started on Integrilin.

Other laboratories from the outside hospital included a
potassium of 3.9, creatinine of 1.4, and a hematocrit of 39.
His arterial blood gas at the outside hospital was 7.46/38/69
on 3 liters nasal cannula.  Electrocardiogram revealed sinus
tachycardia at approximately 110 beats per minute.  Axis was
approximately was 30 degrees.  The patient had poor R wave
progression.  There were a few changes from previous studies.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Hypertension.
2.  Type 2 diabetes mellitus.
3.  Hypercholesterolemia.
4.  Status post myocardial infarction times two;
(a)  In [**2102-5-16**], the patient had a posterior/inferior
myocardial infarction with a cardiac catheterization showing
70% left anterior descending artery, 98% left circumflex, and
diffuse right coronary artery disease.  The patient had
stenting of the left circumflex and the right coronary
artery.
(b)  In [**2103-4-15**], the patient had an inferoseptal
myocardial infarction with cardiac catheterization showing
70% stenosis in the middle of the left anterior descending
artery, 40% stenosis in the second diagonal, and 70% in-stent
restenosis in the left circumflex which was intervened on.
(c)  A redo catheterization in [**2103-5-16**] showed diffuse
proximal and mid disease in the left anterior descending
artery which was stented.
(d)  the patient subsequently underwent redo catheterization
in [**2104-2-15**] when he was found to have left anterior
descending artery 50% narrowing prior to the stent, the left
circumflex stent was widely patent, and the right coronary
artery stent was widely patent.
5.  Peripheral vascular disease.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:

2.  Pepcid 40 mg by mouth once per day.
3.  Neurontin 100 mg by mouth three times per day.
4.  Lasix 40 mg by mouth once per day.
5.  Lipitor 10 mg by mouth once per day.
6.  Moexipril 15 mg by mouth once per day
7.  Xanax 0.5 mg by mouth twice per day.
8.  Glyburide 5 mg by mouth twice per day.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is a pleasant
Portuguese-speaking gentleman who is married and lives with
his wife.  [**Name (NI) **] is a retired box maker.  The patient has an
extensive tobacco history of one pack per day for
approximately 60 years.  He quit smoking in [**2102**].  No history
of alcohol or drug abuse.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Physical examination
on admission revealed his temperature was 99 degrees
Fahrenheit, his blood pressure was 103/59, his heart rate was
78, his respiratory rate was 22, and his oxygen saturation
was 96% on 4 liters nasal cannula.  In general, the patient
was a mildly obese male in no acute distress with labored
breathing.  Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat examination
revealed pupils were equal, round, and reactive to light.
Extraocular movements were intact.  The mucous membranes were
moist.  Neck examination revealed increased jugular venous
pulsation at approximately 12 mm to 14 cm at 30 degrees.
Positive right carotid bruit.  Cardiovascular examination
revealed normal first heart sounds and second heart sounds.
A regular rate.  There was a [**3-22**] crescendo-decrescendo murmur
with radiation to the axilla.  The lungs were clear to
auscultation anteriorly.  There were bibasilar crackles.  No
wheezes.  The abdomen was soft, nontender, and nondistended.
Positive bowel sounds.  No hepatosplenomegaly.  Extremity
examination revealed 1 to 2+ pitting edema to the patellas
bilaterally.  Dorsalis pedis pulses were 2+ bilaterally.

PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:   Laboratories
on admission revealed his white blood cell count was 10.9,
his hematocrit was 35.6, and his platelets were 197.  His
prothrombin time was 13.4, his partial thromboplastin time
was 39.3, and his INR was 1.2.  His sodium was 137, potassium
was 4.3, chloride was 101, bicarbonate was 27, blood urea
nitrogen was 22, creatinine was 1.4, and his blood glucose
was 285.  His calcium was 9, his magnesium was 1.5, and his
phosphorous was 3.4.  Creatine kinase was 370.  CK/MB was 14.
Troponin was 3.72.

CONCISE SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE BY ISSUE/SYSTEM:

1.  CARDIOVASCULAR ISSUES:  Cardiac catheterization revealed
two patent left anterior descending artery overlapping
stents.  The left circumflex was patent with very distal
upper branch disease and a large first obtuse marginal.  The
right coronary artery and the AV groove was patent including
proximal stents.  There was an eccentric 40% mid right
coronary artery lesions.  The left anterior descending artery
was stented with a 3.25 X 18 cypher, and the right coronary
artery was stented with a 3 X 13-mm Hepacoat stent.

The patient received 20 mg of intravenous Lasix in the
Catheterization Laboratory with approximately 700 cc of urine
output.

Following the catheterization, the patient completed an
18-hour course of Integrilin.  Throughout the admission, he
was also continued on an aspirin, Plavix, an ACE inhibitor, a
beta blocker, and a statin.

(a)  Rhythm:  The patient was in a sinus rhythm throughout
the admission.  He was monitored continuously on telemetry.

(b)  Myocardium:  The patient had a congestive heart failure
exacerbation on admission to the hospital with increasing
shortness of breath, lower extremity edema, and exercise
intolerance over the week prior to admission.  He had a good
diuresis in the Catheterization Laboratory following 40 cc of
intravenous Lasix.  The patient continued to have a good
diuresis over the first one day of admission.  His shortness
of breath resolved, and he felt much better.

The patient had previously had a poor left ventricular
ejection fraction of 20% to 30% on previous echocardiograms.
Therefore, a repeat echocardiogram was performed on [**2108-10-29**].  This revealed a mildly dilated left atrium.  The
right atrium was normal in size.  The left ventricular cavity
was severely dilated.  There were multiple left ventricular
wall motion abnormalities including; mid anterior/akinetic,
mid anterior septal/akinetic, mid inferoseptal/akinetic, mid
inferior/akinetic, mid inferolateral/akinetic, anterior
apex/akinetic, septal apex/akinetic, inferior apex/akinetic,
lateral apex/akinetic, and apex/dyskinetic.  The right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion were normal.
The aortic root was mildly dilated as was the ascending
aorta.  There was no aortic valve stenosis.  There was trace
aortic regurgitation.  Mild-to-moderate 1 to 2+ mitral
regurgitation was seen.  There was borderline pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension.  The estimated left ventricular
ejection fraction was less than 20%.

Given the patient's history of multiple myocardial
infarctions and very decreased left ventricular ejection
fraction, pacemaker placement was discussed.  It was
determined that this would not be done as an inpatient, but
the patient was to follow up with Electrophysiology.

2.  TYPE 2 DIABETES MELLITUS ISSUES:  The patient was
continued on an
