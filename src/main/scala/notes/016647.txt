lesions(not intervened upon), CHF (diastolic w/ EF >55%),

.
Mr. [**Known lastname 67025**] presented to [**Location (un) **] on [**8-24**] c/o weakness (referred by
PCP).  He was found to be in AF w/ rapid ventric. reponse (HR
120's).  O2 sats were in the 80's on RA w/ tachypnea.  CXR
demonstrated large b/l pleural effusions which had been
previously worked up at [**Hospital1 1774**] ([**7-5**]) & were then found to be
transudates.  Labs at [**Location (un) **] were notable for HCO3=43, BUN=34,
Creat=1.4, BNP=1900.  While at [**Location (un) **], the pt was diuresed,
initially w/ lasix 40mg IV BID, and later w/ acetazolamide on
the day after admission.  It is unclear from the records how
much he diuresed.  On the AM of [**2107-8-26**], the pt was found
unarousable w/ an ABG=7.3/80/40.  He was placed on bipap &
diuresed.  Repeat ABG=7.38/65/59.  Soon after, he was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management/intervention.
.
The patient himself describes having had dyspnea (esp. w/
exertion) of unclear duration (perhaps months) along w/ fatigue,
weight loss, and decreased appetite. ?PND. He reports no CP,
palpitations, syncope, or edema.

ECHO ([**8-27**])
Conclusions:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated. There is moderate symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Due to
suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality
cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is normal (LVEF>55%). The right ventricular cavity is
dilated. There is abnormal septal motion/position consistent
with right ventricular pressure/volume overload. The aortic root
is moderately dilated. The ascending
aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly to
moderately thickened. There is a minimally increased gradient
consistent with minimal aortic valve stenosis. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There
is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2107-5-26**],
findings are similar.

Brief Hospital Course:
86yo man w/ CAD s/p RCA stent in [**1-3**], LAD & LCx lesions
reportedly not intervened upon, diastolic CHF w/ MR, permn't
pacer for reported tachy-brady synd, presenting from [**Location (un) **] w/
CHF & AF w/ RVR.  Also, found to be in respiratory distress with
acute on chronic respiratory acidosis.  His hospital course for
this admission is as follows:
.
1. CHF: Pt was fluid overloaded on CXR.  Likely of diastolic
etiology given nml EF. MR & AF w/ RVR likely further
complicating diastolic filling.  Pt was diuresed aggresively
with lasix.  His R pleural effusion was tapped & c/w transudate
(as in past per records).  Repeat echo similiar to prior study
in [**5-5**]. He was beta-blocked to improve cardiac filling & rate
control his afib.  Because of low SBP's 80's-110's he could only
tolerate low doses of metoprolol, currently at 25mg PO bid.
Given patient responded well with initial IV lasix diuresis, and
he was put back to his home doses of lasix PO 80mg on [**2107-8-30**],
and he is euvolemic at the time of discharge.
.
2. Afib: Likely contributing to CHF picture.  Given chronicity
of a-fib & subtherapeutic INR now, cardioversion not attempted
initially.  Rate controlled with metoprolol.  Digoxin held.
Coumadin held initially because of thoracentesis & possibility
of additional procedures, and restarted on [**8-29**] with low dose
5mg PO qday and continued monitoring his INR, discharge INR 1.5.
 Patient will need to continue metoprolol 25mg PO bid and
Coumadin 5mg PO qhs, and continued monitoring of INR q2-3 days
at the extended facility to keep INR between [**3-4**] (goal).
.
3. Hypoxia & hypercarbia: likely combination of COPD & CHF.  Pt
treated with BiPAP after he was found to be hypoxic & in
respiratory acidosis. An a-line was placed for closer monitoring
of BP & ABGs initally.  Pt retained CO2 even at Fi02 of 40%,
thus he was maintained on low flow O2 and transitioned back to
NC, then to RA. Goal O2 sat is 88-92%.  He was at around 90-92%
on RA at the time of discharge.
.
4. Acidemia: likely due to acute on chronic resp acidosis +/-
metabolic alkalosis from diuresis.  This improved as pt was
treated with low-flow O2, diuresed and effusion tapped, which
showed transduate picture.
.
5. Hypokalemia, hypernatremia: hypokalemia likely secondary to
hypokalemic, hypochloremic metabolic alkalosis from primary
respiratory acidosis. We replaced free water and potassium, and
pt responded well with this regimen.
.
6. CAD: relatively stable, will continue ASA and metoprolol.
.
7. Code status: full code, daughter [**Name (NI) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 110**] is HCP
.
8. FEN: heeart healthy soft diet
.
9. Prophylaxis: Pt eating, heparin 5000 U sc tid
