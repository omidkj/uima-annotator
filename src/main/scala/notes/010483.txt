Mrs. [**Known lastname **] is a 79 year old woman with a past medical history
significant for CHB s/p PPM, DM, dementia, and a recent
admission for a fall s/p ORIF hip fracture now admitted for
pneumonia, UTI, and sepsis.  The patient was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**]
from [**Date range (1) **] after presenting with a fall, [**Date range (1) 1834**] ORIF
right intertrochanteric hip fracture repair on [**12-4**], and was
discharged to rehab with complications.  Since discharge, she
has had increasing confusion, agitation, and a productive cough,
for which she was transferred tonight to [**Hospital1 18**] for further
evaluation.  Prior to transfer, the patient had a CXR that, per
report, was negative for consolidation, as well as a negative
UA.

In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, initial VS 97.2 80 127/58 16 100%.  Labs were
notable for a lactate of 3.5, UA with 54 WBC, and a chest CT
with a multifocal left-sided pneumonia. She received CTX 1 gm,
vanco 1 gm, azithromycin 500 mg, 2L IVF, and was admitted to the
MICU for further management.

[**2126-12-13**] 11:10 pm BLOOD CULTURE      #2. Blood Culture, Routine
(Pending):

Legionella Urinary Antigen  (Final [**2126-12-14**]):
      NEGATIVE FOR LEGIONELLA SEROGROUP 1 ANTIGEN.

MRSA SCREEN (Final [**2126-12-16**]):    No MRSA isolated.

ECG [**2126-12-13**]:
Sinus rhythm. Possible old inferior myocardial infarction. ST-T
wave changes in the anterolateral leads suggest ischemia.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2126-12-3**] no clear change.

Portable CXR [**2126-12-13**]:
FINDINGS: Single semierect frontal view of the chest
demonstrates a left
pectoral pacer/AICD with leads terminating in the right atrium
and right
ventricle. The lung volumes are low, accentuating cardiomegaly.
There is no vascular congestion. Equivocal opacity in the left
costophrenic angle
correlates with consolidation on subsequent CT. The right lung
is clear.

IMPRESSION: Equivocal opacity in the left base, where there is
confluent and increased consolidation on subsequent CT.

CT head w/o contrast [**2126-12-14**]:
FINDINGS: There is no intracranial hemorrhage, mass effect,
edema, or shift of normally midline structures. The [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white
matter differentiation is preserved. A tiny right basal ganglia
lacune versus prominent Virchow-[**Doctor First Name **] space appears unchanged.
Ventricles and sulci are prominent, consistent with age-related
involution. Bifrontal extra-axial spaces are prominent,
unchanged empty sella.

Paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are well aerated.
Vascular
calcifications are seen in the cavernous carotid and vertebral
arteries.
Globes and soft tissues are unremarkable.

IMPRESSION:
1. No acute intracranial process.
2. Age-related involution changes.

CT chest/abdomen/pelvis w/o contrast [**2126-12-14**]:
CT CHEST: A left pectoral cardiac pacer/AICD is in place with
leads
terminating in the right atrium and right ventricle. The heart
is normal in size without pericardial effusion. There is
calcified disease involving the LAD. No mediastinal, hilar, or
axillary lymphadenopathy by size criteria.

There is dense consolidation in the left upper and lower lobes,
consistent
with pneumonia. The right lung is relatively clear. Central
airways are not well assessed allowing for motion.

CT ABDOMEN: Visceral assessment is highly limited by lack of
contrast.
Allowing for such, the liver demonstrates no focal lesion. The
