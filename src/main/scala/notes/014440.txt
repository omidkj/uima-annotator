Brief Hospital Course:
1. CAD:
- The patient has lateral ischemia c SSCP/SOB, transferred here
for possible cath.  Pt started on hemodialysis prior to
catheterization.  Cardiac cath revealed: 70%LAD [**Last Name (un) 2435**], 99%[**First Name9 (NamePattern2) 8714**]
[**Last Name (un) 2435**], 40% RCA, 90%[**First Name9 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) 2435**]., 1+MR, and an LVEF of 55%.  CT
surgery was consulted.  Cardiology attending and CT surgery
discussed risks/benefits of CABG with pt and his family. Pt &

Pravastatin, Metoprolol, and heparin drip.

2. CHF, EF 55%

CKD. Creatinine now 5.6.  Baseline Cr. 4.6-4.8. GFR approx. 12
ml/min. Pt also has metabolic acidosis with respiratory
compensation.
- dose meds for GFR of 12
- Dialysis catheter placed by IR tomorrow
- Possible HD tomorrow
- continue nephrocaps, Epoetin.
- f/u on serum Iron, [**Name (NI) 59658**], Ferritin, PTH, PO4.

time was 42 minutes and total bypass time was 56 min.  He
tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to the CSRU on
Neo and Propofol.  He was extubated on POD#1 and had
hemodialysis on POD#2 and #4.  His chest tubes were d/c'd on
POD#2 and was transferred to the floor on POD#4.  He continued
to progress and was straight cathed [**Hospital1 **] for urine outputs of 2
liters/day.  He was increased to TID straight caths as he had
large residuals.  He did not require dialysis for the rest of
his stay and was discharged to rehab on POD #8 in stable
condition. He will have a chem 10 drawn on [**11-28**] and faxed to Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 59659**] and he will see her early next week for renal follow
