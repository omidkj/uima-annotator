Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 30**]
Chief Complaint:
Left foot ulceration and cellulitis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
1. Left foot incision and drainage with debridement and
    hardware removal.
2. Right foot incision and drainage.


History of Present Illness:
This is a lovely 57-year-old woman with a pmh significant for
DMII, diabetic neuropathy, HTN, hypercholesterolemia, psoriasis,
CAD, CHF,  and multiple podiatric interventions for right and
left foot ulcers/osteomyelitis, who was admitted from podiatry
clinic on [**2119-3-10**] for fevers, chills, and expression of pus from
left foot ulcer and started on vanc and zosyn.  The patient was
seen in the [**Hospital **] clinic on [**2119-3-9**], where her BP was 94/58. ID has
been following her for recurrent MRSA osteomyelitis and septic
arthritis. She was most recently treated with 6 weeks of
vancomycin, ending in [**2118-7-29**], and then was placed on
suppressive doxycycline. She does have metatarsal hardware in
her R foot, which is thought to be distant from the site of
infection. The patient reports that she has had intermittent
vomiting over the past few months and worsened in the days prior
to admission. She also endorses chills and subjective fevers on
the day of admission. She had hit her foot on the day of her ID
appt which resulted in the wound opening up and bleeding. On
[**3-10**], she had chills, subjective fever and n/v.
.
Of note, the patient notes that she has had DOE with exertion
(for example, walking a flight of stairs) for greater than one
year. She has had acute worsening of her DOE with dyspnea even
with just walking to use the bathroom starting today. She also
has had acute worsening of orthopnea today, even with a slight
decrease in head elevation she has orthopnea. She has been dizzy
and lightheaded when she changes position.
.
She may need to go to the OR with podiatry but they have not yet
committed and they are still following.  ID is also following,
last seen on [**3-11**]. Since the night prior to her transfer to the
MICU, the patient has been hypotensive with SBPs in the 80s
(baseline pressures according to patient are in the 90s) and
creatinine up to 3.2 (baseline 1.0).  Also felt nauseated last
night and could not eat dinner and mildly febrile this morning
to 100.8. She received 2L NS boluses, CXR, UA, Ucx and Bcx were
sent. Patient is alert and oriented x3, looking well.
.
She did have pna around Xmas, had a recent cxr and was told it
was healed. Was treated with unclear [**Name2 (NI) 621**]. She has previously
been treated for htn.

Echo [**2119-3-10**]
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is
mildly dilated with moderate global hypokinesis. Due to
suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality
cannot be fully excluded (LVEF = 30%). [Intrinsic function is
more depressed given the severity of aortic regurgitation and
mitral regurgitation.] The right ventricular cavity is
moderately dilated with moderate global free wall hypokinesis.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. Moderate (2+) aortic regurgitation is
seen directed along the interventricular septum The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate (2+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is
seen. There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial
effusion. IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Left ventricular
cavity dilation with moderate global hypokinesis c/w diffuse
process (toxin, metabolic, etc.). Right ventricular cavity
dilation with free wall hypokinesis. Moderate aortic
regurgitation. Moderate mitral regurgitation.
Trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
If there is a clinical history to suggest endocarditis, a TEE is
suggested.
