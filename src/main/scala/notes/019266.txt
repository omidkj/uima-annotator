Findings
LEFT ATRIUM: Dilated LA. No spontaneous echo contrast or
thrombus in the LA/LAA or the RA/RAA.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Normal RA size. No ASD by 2D or
color Doppler.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Mild symmetric LVH. Normal LV cavity size. Mild
regional LV systolic dysfunction. Mildly depressed LVEF.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTA: Normal aortic diameter at the sinus level. Mildly dilated
ascending aorta. Simple atheroma in ascending aorta. Focal
calcifications in ascending aorta. Normal aortic arch diameter.
Normal descending aorta diameter. Complex (>4mm) atheroma in the
descending thoracic aorta.

AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS.
Trace AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. No MVP.
Moderate to severe (3+) MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Moderate [2+] TR.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflet.
No PS. Physiologic PR.

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify I was present in compliance with HCFA
regulations. The patient was under general anesthesia throughout
the procedure. No TEE related complications. The rhythm appears
to be atrial fibrillation. Results were personally reviewed with
the MD caring for the patient. See Conclusions for post-bypass
data The post-bypass study was performed while the patient was
receiving vasoactive infusions (see Conclusions for listing of
medications).

REGIONAL LEFT VENTRICULAR WALL MOTION:





     N = Normal, H = Hypokinetic, A = Akinetic, D = Dyskinetic
Conclusions
PRE-BYPASS:
The left atrium is dilated. No spontaneous echo contrast or
thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium/left atrial
appendage or the body of the right atrium/right atrial
appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color
Doppler.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. There is mild regional left
ventricular systolic dysfunction with focalities in the septal
wall added to the mild global hypokinesis. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 40 %).
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. There are simple atheroma
in the ascending aorta. There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the
descending thoracic aorta.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no
mitral valve prolapse. Moderate to severe (3+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is
seen. There is no pericardial effusion.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in person of the results on [**Known lastname **],
[**Last Name (un) **] at 9:50AM.

POST-BYPASS: For the post-bypass study, the patient was
receiving vasoactive infusions including epinephrine 0.02
mcg/kg/min and phenylephrine 0.5 mcg/kg/min.
There is mild residula MR across the mitral valve. There is a
mitral ring well seated. Intact thoracic aorta. There is
moderate TR as before.
RV has mild global dysfunction.
LVEF 40%. The septal wall is severely hypokiunetic as before.
.
  I certify that I was present for this procedure in compliance
with HCFA regulations.
