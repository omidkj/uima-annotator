Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to the [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 1675**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] Medical
Center on [**2135-5-1**] for preoperative anticoagulation and surgical
management of his aortic valve disease. Heparin was started and
he was worked-up in the usual preoperative manner. On [**2135-5-3**],
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was taken to the operating room where he underwent a
redo sternotomy with an aortic valve replacement utilizing a
23mm St. [**Male First Name (un) 923**] mechanical valve. Postoperatively he was taken to
the cardiac surgical intensive care unit for monitoring. On
postoperative day one, Mr. [**Known lastname **] [**Last Name (Titles) 5058**] neurologically intact
and was extubated. He was then transferred to the cardiac
surgical step down unit for further recovery. He was gently
diuresed towards his preoperative weight. Coumadin was started
for anticoagulation for his mechanical valve and atrial
fibrillation. Mr. [**Known lastname **] had pain with swallowing and his
medications were changed to elixirs. The physical therapy
service was consulted for assistance with his postoperative
strength and mobility. The otolaryngology service was consulted
who noted a mucosal irregularity on the posterior pharyngeal
wall. Saline gargles were recommended and bactroban nasal
ointment for epistaxis prophylaxis. Follow-up was recommended in
3 weeks to assess resolution of the lesion. Mr. [**Known lastname 61693**] sore
throat slowly improved so that he was able to adequately take in
sufficient nutrition. As his INR was subtherapeutic, heparin was
started until his INR was within range. Ultimately, his INR rose
above 2.0 and his heparin was discontinued. Mr. [**Known lastname **]
continued to make steady progress and was discharged home on
postoperative day ten. He will follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], his
cardiologist and his primary care physician as an outpatient.
