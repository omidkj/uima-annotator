History of Present Illness:
57 year old male with history of insulin dependent diabetes
mellitus, Hepatitis C s/p IVDU, Bipolar disorder, PTSD,
hypertension, hypothyroidism who was found at home by his
girlfriend altered, diaphoretic. Per records, girlfriend
reported patient had slept all day yesterday, had not taken his
insulin or any other medications recently. [**Month (only) 116**] have taken more
morphine than he was supposed to and had run out of percocet.
BS111. The patient was taken to [**Hospital1 18**] [**Location (un) 620**] where CT head
non-contrast was negative, CXR showed infiltrates bilaterally.
Patient was in respiratory distress and acute on chronic renal
failure (Cr 5.2 up from baseline Cr2.0) so was transferred to
[**Hospital1 18**] ED for V/Q scan to rule out pulmonary emboli, given the
acuity of his symptoms and desaturations to 86%. He was given
Vancomycin/Levofloxacin prior to transfer.
.
Of note, patient had a biopsy/removal of right lower extremity
growth two weeks ago. And has a large erythematous, tender and
indurated region on his left buttocks.
.
In the ED initial vital signs were not documented as patient
reportedly combative. Patient was in respiratory distress and
desaturating to 88% on nasal cannula. He responded somewhat
better nonrebreather. Given the infiltrates on CXR, V/Q scan was
not felt to be useful at this time. The patient underwent a
repeat CXR which confirmed bilateral infiltrates; urine culture
was sent and the patient was given Flagyl for ?aspiration and
clindamycin for possible cellulitis/nec fasc. Surgery evaluated
the patient's buttock induration and RLE biopsy site, felt there
was low likelihood of nec fasc. ?ABG in the ED was 7.21/49/76/21
and lactate 1.0. Prior to transfer to the [**Hospital1 18**] [**Hospital Ward Name 516**],
patient became extremely combative, did not respond to Haldol
5/Ativan 2, requiring four security guards to restrain and was
ultimately intubated, on Fentanyl/Versed initially and switched
to Propofol but resumed on Fent/Versed when he became
hypotensive. He received 1L lactated ringers en route.
.
On arrival, patient intubated, sedated but opens eyes to noxious
stimuli
.
Review of Systems:
(+) Per HPI
(-) Unable to obtain as patient intubated.

Imaging:
CXR [**2130-1-28**]- Compromised secondary to diminished lung volume.
Cephalization but no frank interstitial edema. Mediastinum
grossly unremarkable. Cardiac size likely normal but appears
exaggerated due to low lung volumes. No effusion, no
pneumothorax.
CXR [**2130-1-29**] - ETT now in place, ~3cm above carina, orogastric
feeding tube also in place. Cephalization with some interstitial
edema still present.
CXR [**2130-1-31**]: New right upper lobe and right basilar
infiltrates, suspicious for infection.

Brief Hospital Course:
57 year old male with history of Type II diabetes, Hepatitis C
s/p IVDU, recently diagnosed liver [**Male First Name (un) **] concerning for HCC,
recent lower extremity excisonal biopsy for melanoma, Bipolar
disorder, PTSD, hypertension, hypothyroidism,  who was found at
home by his girlfriend altered, diaphoretic, hypoxic.
.
# Altered mental status: Initially likely multifactorial from
hypoxemia + intoxications. Patient was on multiple centerally
acting medications at home. Per his PCP he has chronic pain
syndrome since an MVA years ago and has lately required
increasing opiate doses d/t abdomninal pain attributable to
newly diagnosed liver [**Male First Name (un) **]. Per his PCP and per the patient no
recent history of alcohol or other substance abuse. Pt has known
cirrhosis but his liver functions were stable and he had no
asterexis thus hepatic encephalopathy was not thought likely. He
did present with acute on chronic renal failure but degree of
uremia was not thought sufficient to cause encephalopathy. Pt
has known hypothyroidism and TSH = 11 on admission but had no
other features of myxedema. RPR was negative. Serotonin syndrome
was considered in view of pt's home meds but thought unlikely in
the lack of impressive regidity. Pt was intubated and sedated on
admission d/t hypoxia responsive to non-rebreather mask in the
setting of severe combativeness. He became severely agitated
after weaning from sedation and extubation on [**1-31**] with little
response to IV Diazepam or precedex. Thiamin was started.
Psychiatry was consulted in view of patient's [**Doctor First Name **] psychiatric
history and agreed with diagnosis of delirium, and per their
recs thorazine was started with excellent response with
subsequent complete resolution of his delirium. Thorazine was
then discontinued and Seroquel 25/25/100 and Celexa 20 were
started. These medications should continue to be titrated up in
the outpatient setting.
