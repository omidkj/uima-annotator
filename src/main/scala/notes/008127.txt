Service: NEUROLOGY

Allergies:
Percocet / Morphine

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 618**]
Chief Complaint:
Blurry Vision

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
The pt is a 72 year-old right-handed woman with a past
medical history including HTN, CAD s/p stenting, s/p pacemaker
placement, and atrial fibrillation/flutter treated with coumadin
who presented to
[**Hospital3 **] with a 2-hour history of blurry vision and was
found to have an intraventricular hemorrhage.
.
The patient explains she was in her usual state of health this
evening when she came home from eating dinner with her husband.
She recalls sitting down to enjoy TV with him.  While watching
the television at between 6 and 7 pm, she noted the sudden onset
of "blurry vision."  Although she tried covering each eye
individually, she maintains the blurriness did not resolve with
either maneuver.  She tried "putting my head down" to alleviate
the discomfort.  When the symptom did not abate, she asked her
husband to call an ambulance.  Prior to her EMS evaluation, she
insisted on making a trip to the ladies' room.  She recalls she
was able to stand and ambulate to the bathroom with her
husband's
assistance.  She felt "dizzy" as a result of the vision
difficulty, but was able to complete the task.  She was
subsequently taken to [**Hospital 28798**] Hospital where a head CT was
performed.  The imaging reportedly demonstrated a 2.2 x 1 cm
acute hematoma in the third ventricle and likely parenchymal
hemorrhage in the left midbrain.  Pertinent lab findings
included
an INR of 2.4 and wbc of 14.6.  The patient was subsequently
transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation.
.
At the time of the Neurology consult, the patient reports
persistent visual difficulty.  She describes the disturbance as
a
blurriness that improves somewhat with eye closure.  She says it
feels as if her "eyes are crossed."  She notes that objects
appear to be "jiggling."  She denies double vision, however.
She
also denies headache, neck pain, vertigo, lightheadedness,
nausea, and frank gait disturbance.
.
In the ED, anticoagulation was reversed with vitamin K (10 mg IV
x 1), profilnine (2300), FFP (2 units).
.
