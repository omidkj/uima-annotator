Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 58yo M well known to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], with CAD s/p
CABG, CHF EF 20%, s/p BiV/ICD, OSA, DM2, obesity and htn
presents with acute SOB requiring intubation s/s flash pulmonary
edema after missing his [**Last Name (STitle) **] dose x 2 days, with subsequent
extubation 2 hours later and 2 days of aggressive diuresis.
.
1 Resp Distress:
Given the history of CHF, acute decomensation of CHF with flash
pulmonary edema was the likely etiology. The patient can have
sudden onset respiratory decompensation s/s to both high salt
meals and/or anxiety and in this case missed his [**Last Name (STitle) **] dose for
2 days prior to onset of symptoms. Patient was extubated soon
after intubation and with diuresis, had an accelerated
resolution of his symptoms.
.
2. Cardiac
a. pump: on admission, patient was volume overloaded but is now
better maintained after diuresis. Patient should be continued on
coreg, lisinopril, aldactone, digoxin on pre-admission [**Last Name (STitle) 4319**] and
should not miss [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 4319**].
.
b. coronaries: no evidence of active ischemia, though the
patient has a history of CAD s/p CABG. mild troponin leak to
0.06 at peak in setting of CHF likely represented demand
ischemia. There were no dynamic ECG changes.
.
c. Rhythm: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is s/p BiV/ICD, with stable rhythm.
Appears AS-VP on ECG. Continue Amiodorone at pre-admission
[**Known lastname 4319**].
.
3. Dm2: Was maintained on lantus 20 [**Hospital1 **] during admission as
sugars have been in the 150-200 range. His home dose is 70 [**Hospital1 **]
and he should return to this regimen upon discharge.
.
4. CRI: Mr. [**Known lastname **] baseline Creatinine was 1.2-1.5 in [**4-5**]. He
should have his creatinine followed by his PCP and should avoid
nephrotoxic medications.
.
5. Gout: Allopurinol and colchicine were held during this
admission will being diuresed to avoid nephrotoxic medications.
Can be restarted on discharge.
