Chief Complaint:
Transfer from OSH, s/p vfib arrest, anoxic brain injury

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
55 y/o male with a h/o morbid obesity and HTN who was
transferred from [**Hospital6 17032**] s/p vfib arrest.
Pt sufferred a witnessed episode of cardiac arrest in the AM of
[**2147-3-14**]. In the AM of his arrest, he had taken loratadine for
persistent upper respiratory allergic symptoms. Around 8:00AM on
[**2147-3-14**], he complained to his wife of a "head rush," turned blue
in the face, and subsequently collapsed. He did not hit his head
and his wife lowered him to the floor and called EMS. EMS
arrived to the scene in about 5 minutes. FSBG was 153. When EMS
arrived, pt was cyanotic and had no pulse. He was intubated
emergently in the field. AED revealed asystole. Atropine was
given and he was given an amp of D50. Monitor then showed PEA
arrest. He was shocked twice in the field for presumed vfib by
AED signal. Subsequently, became asystolic and received atropine
as well as epi. Time to spontaneous circulation was estimated to
be no more than 5 minutes.
.
He was brought to the [**Hospital3 17031**] where he was documented
to be in SR. Initial EKG revealed ST at 115 bpm without QT
prolongation. CTA was negative for PE and revealed B/L chest
infiltrates c/w PNA. BCx were drawn and he was given ceftriazone
and levofloxacin. TTE showed normal left ventricular size and
function without any valvular abnormalities, EF 50%. Pt was
loaded with Dilantin. Pt was given IV steroids for bronchspasm.
Pt was seen by cardiology who treated him for cardiac ischemia
as the etiology of his vfib arrest. He was started on a heparin
gtt, amiodarone gtt after bolus, and ASA. Repeat head imaging
just revealed diffuse cortial edema. Pt was transferred
hemodynamically stable for further evaluation by [**Hospital1 18**] MICU.
.

no recent F/C. No CP or SOB. No palpitations, syncope, or LE
edema.

[**3-16**] cxr:
IMPRESSION:
1. Low-lying ETT for which partial withdrawl is requested for
more optimal positioning.
2. Left lower lobe pneumonia versus atelectasis.
.
[**3-17**] eeg:
IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal EEG due to the slow and
unreactive
background. This suggests a severe encephalopathy, which may be
seen
with infections, toxic metabolic abnormalities, medication
effect or
global hypoxic injury. The low voltage frontal beta rhythm is
likely a
medication effect. No epileptiform features were noted.
.
[**3-17**] echo:
The left atrium is normal in size. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and systolic
function (LVEF>55%). Regional left ventricular wall motion is
normal. Transmitral Doppler and tissue velocity imaging are
consistent with normal LV diastolic function. Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic root is
mildly dilated at the sinus level. The ascending aorta is mildly
dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally
normal with good leaflet excursion. There is no aortic valve
stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse. There is mild pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Normal global and regional biventricular systolic
function. No outflow tract obstruction. Mildly dilated thoracic
aorta.
.
[**3-19**] EEG:
IMPRESSION: This is a markedly abnormal EEG due to the low
voltage,
slow and disorganized background rhythm which does not change
with
external stimulation. This pattern suggests a severe
encephalopathy,
which may be seen with infections, toxic metabolic
abnormalities,
medication effect or global hypoxic injury. No epileptiform
features
were noted.
.
[**3-20**] cxr:
Right subclavian catheter continues to terminate within the
right atrium. Endotracheal tube remains in standard position.
Heart size is normal. Left lower lobe atelectasis has markedly
improved. No new or progressive abnormalities are identified.

Brief Hospital Course:
 55 y/o male with a h/o morbid obesity and HTN who was
transferred from an OSH for further evaluation and management
s/p vfib arrest and subsuquent anoxic brain injury.
.
# s/p vfib arrest/anoxic brain injury:  Vfib arrest occurred on
[**2147-3-14**], two days prior to transfer.  A CT Head accompanied the
patient, and images reviewed with neurology revealed diffuse
cortical edema.  Neurology did not see need for steroids,
mannitol or hyperventilation.  The patient was continued on
dilantin and followed closely by neurology.  The patient had
EEG's in the hospital which confirmed severe encephalopathy and
this was consistent with OSH EEG showing anoxic encephalopathy.
Neurology continued to confirm poor prognosis and based on
multiple family meetings it was decided to remove the ET tube.
Once the patient was extubated on [**3-21**] he expired hours later and
was made comfortable with morphine.
.
# HTN: The patient's blood pressures were closely followed and
his blood pressure was maintained with propofol and labetolol as
needed.  His pressures were closely monitored with an A-line,
and her remained well-controlled during his course.
.
# PNA: The patient was having fevers, and a white count. His osh
cxr revealed RUL and LUL consolidation, and based on this a
concern was for pneumonia.  He was covered broadly with
vanc/cefepime and flagyl.  The patient continued to spike
fevers, and this may have been related to his brain injury.
Prior to death, he was made CMO and all antibiotics were
stopped.
