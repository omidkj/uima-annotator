IMAGING:
[**6-23**] (CXR) - no ptx, no effusion, no mediastinal widening
[**6-23**] (C-Spine OSH) - C4-5 subluxation fx
[**6-23**] (CT Head OSH) - (reportedly) negative
[**6-24**] (MRI C-spine) - 1. Intramedullary cord signal abnormality
spanning the levels of C2-C6, most compatible with cord edema
and with a more focal heterogeneous component which expands the
cord at the level C4-C5 that raises the possibility of
underlying intramedullary focal hemorrhage/hematoma. 2. Status
post C4-C5 posterior fusion with improvement in previously noted
acute malalignment. 3. Strongly suspected disruption of the
posterior longitudinal ligament. C4-C5 disc protrusion with
superior extrusion of contents demonstrated immediately
posterior to the C4 vertebral body which at this point results
in elevation of the posterior longitudinal ligament and abuts
the ventral aspect of the spinal cord.
[**6-28**] (KUB - PEG Contrast Scan): no contrast extrav
[**6-29**] (CXR): Desaturation and increased FiO2 with right lung base
consolidation on CXR - Bronchoscopy with BAL (Bronchus
intermedius BAL and RLL BAL with Left BAL) performed; Patient
started on Vanco/Zosyn/Cipro for suspected VAP.
[**7-1**] (CXR): RLL pneumonia, unchanged pneumoperitoneum
[**7-2**] (Renal US): Normal renal ultrasound
[**7-2**] (2D-Echo): LVEF 65%. Suboptimal image quality. No definite
vegetations. No AS.
[**7-2**] (CXR): Interval worsening of RLL PNA w/ new opacity in the

lingula suggests ?sequelae of aspiration.
[**7-3**] (KUB): contrast study PEG w no extrav; +significant free
air
[**7-4**] (CT torso): B pleural effusions, complete collapse of RLL
c/w consolidation, mod pneumoperitoneum likely d/t PEG air leak,
no e/o solid viscus perf, rounded focus of consolidation in LUL
likely infection
[**7-22**] (LENIs): No evidence DVT
[**7-23**] (CT neck/torso): No fluid collxn, lymphadenopathy or bony
destruction in neck. RLL consolidation decr in size w/remaining
rounded density c/w atelectasis. 6x5cm rim-enhancing fluid
collxn in L obturator internus muscle, 2.5cm fluid collxn in L
gluteux maximus likely phlegmon
[**7-24**] (CXR): There is a tracheostomy tube whose tip is 4.7 cm
above the carina. Lung fields are grossly clear.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 88967**] was taken the operating room by the Ortho spine
surgery team on [**2184-6-23**] by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1007**] to restore stability to his
C4-C5 fracture. Post-operatively, he was taken to the Trauma ICU
for further care.  He returned to the OR on [**2184-6-25**] with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] of the acute care surgery service for a PEG, trach and IVC
filter.

His hospitalization by systems:

Neuro:  Mr. [**Known lastname 88967**] was noted to be paraplegic in the lower
extremities with minimal function of the upper extremities.  As
noted, he was taken to the OR on the day of his admission,
[**2184-6-23**] for operative repair of his C4/C5 instability.  His
motor exam stabilized over the course of his ICU stay with 3-4/5
strength in his bilateral biceps.  He was continued on Ativan
for anxiety and Dilaudid as needed for pain, both to decent
effect.  He did exhibit some brief periods of delirium in the
initial days of his hospitalization as well as depression.
Psychiatry assessed and believed his delirium to be
multifactorial in nature and to avoid psychiatric medications
for the short term.  His delirium did clear over the next few
days.  His depression was thought to be an appropriate response
given the circumstances and he was started on antidepressant
therapy and followed closely by Social work during his stay who
felt his coping was appropriate as well.  He was kept in the
c-collar for a period after his surgery and per Ortho spine his
c-collar was removed on [**7-27**]. He is alert and oriented
x3.Currently he is out of bed to a motorized wheelchair; he has
some movement in his bilateral upper extremities and is able to
feed himself with assistive device.

CV: He was initially in neurogenic shock, briefly on pressor
support in the early days but able to be weaned off by HD 5.
Midodrine for blood pressure support was started on HD 4 and
continued intermittently throughout his stay but was eventually
stopped. At time of discharge, his blood pressures are stable
ranging between 98-114 systolic.

Resp: Given the nature of his spinal cord injury, he was
intubated early in his hospitalization.  He underwent
tracheostomy on HD 3.  Early he had continued desaturation
episodes and CXR imaging was concerning for mucous plugging. He
was also noted to develop a right lower lobe consolidation,
concerning for ventilator associated pneumonia, and he was
started on broad spectrum antibiotic therapy consisting of
vanc/cipro/zosyn on [**6-29**].  He had several bronchoscopies in the
ICU showing a combination of mucous plugging and evidence of
pneumonia.  BAL cultures were sent when appropriate. He
continued to intermittently have episodes of mucous plugging
requiring return to ICU then step down unit and back to the
regular surgical floor. These episodes decreased significantly
over the course of his stay and at time of this dictation are no
longer an active issue. His saturations ranging 97-98%. His
trach was downsized so that he presently has a 6 fr cuffless,
fenestrated in place. As he improves during his rehab course he
should be able to be de-cannulated.

GI: He underwent PEG tube placement on HD 3, he was started on
tube feeds (Replete with Fiber) which were advanced to goal
without difficulty.  On POD 2 from the PEG placement, routine
CXR showed large amount of pneumoperitoneum (he also spiked a
temperature and showed signs of consolidation. His tube feeds
were held and a tube contrast study was performed to rule out
malposition or contrast extravasation and it was negative.
Pneumoperitoneum was demonstrated on multiple subsequent CXRs
but this was consistent with the normal amount expected after
PEG tube placement and continued to decrease. His tube feedings
were resumed. Over the course of his stay he was evaluated by
Speech & Swallow and was given an oral diet. His tube feedings
are currently being cycled and he is on a regular diet and
tolerating both without any difficulties.

GU: He had a
