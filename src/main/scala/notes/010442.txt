Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 613**]
Chief Complaint:
Altered mental status.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None.

History of Present Illness:
This is a 52-year-old woman with a history of IDDM Type II
complicated by nephropathy and neuropathy, CHF with LVEF of 30%,
HTN, HLD, CAD s/p CABG x2 complicated by sternal wound abscess
(MSSA/MRSA), CKD, HIT and COPD recently discharged from [**Hospital 87678**] on [**2169-6-15**] presenting with subdural hematoma, acute
renal failure and altered mental status. Patient was admitted to
MEEI for endophthalmitis panophthalmitis and L sinus disease
treated empirically with Vanco/Ceftaz/Levofloxacin while
inpatient at [**Hospital 13128**]. ENT evaluated patient and drained
maxillary sinus which grew MSSA and VSE. CT chest showed
possible phlegmon of lower portion of chest surgery wound but
seen by CT surgery who did not feel there was concern for
sternal wound infection. Her course was also complicated by ARF
[**3-16**] supratherapetic Vancomycin levels, continued leukocytosis
(WBC 16), LUE superficla clot, lymphadenopathy noted on
abdominal CT of uncertain significance, polyarticular pain for
which she was seen by rheumatology (thought to have gout though
crystals not found on knee arthrocentesis).  Patient was
discharged home to complete Levofloxacin and Linezolid 4 week
course (aniticipated completion [**2169-7-4**]).

Per husband, patient began having body twitches and confusion
one day following discharge from the hospital.  She was having
auditory and visual hallucinations. She then fell at home last
Friday but did not inform anyone that she had hit her head.
During this time, she was drinking 2.5-3L water daily.   Then
due to increasing confusion, patient's husband took her to
[**Name (NI) **] Hospital ED. On eval at OSH, CT head showed small
tentorial SDH and so was transferred here for neurosurgery
evaluation. Neurosurgery evaluated patient in the ED indicating
"very small intracranial bleed, no surgical indication
currently. Patient does not need any AED at this time. Plan to
admit to medicine for multiple medical problems and further
workup of AMS and plan for rescan with NCHCT in 24hrs."

In the ED, no initial vitals were recorded. Nursing staff
indicates patient was experiencing l eye blurry from recent
infxn being treated with erythromcyin and cipro drop. Patient
was attentive with non-specific neruologic examination. Mild
right nasolabial fold flattening and asterixis.
.
Currently, patient denies pain.  Otherwise unable to give
reliable history due to altered mental status.

CXR [**2169-6-25**]: IMPRESSION:  Interstitial prominence may represent
vascular crowding but mild volume overload is not excluded.

CT head [**2169-6-26**]:
IMPRESSION:  Stable appearance of a small left subdural
hematoma, tracking
along the falx cerebri and tentorium cerebelli.  No
intraparenchymal or
intraventricular hemorrhage or fractures.  Calcifications in the
bilateral
cavernous, carotid and vertebral arteries.  The ventricles and
sulci are
prominent, compatible with age-related involutional changes.

CT head [**2169-6-27**]: IMPRESSION:  No significant change from prior
study.

CXR [**2169-6-25**] IMPRESSION:
1.  Right-sided PICC line tip in the right atrium.
2.  Improvement in mild pulmonary vascular congestion and
cardiomegally.

Echo [**2169-6-28**]
The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is mild to moderate
regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with hypokinesis
of the inferior wall, distal septum and apex. The remaining
segments contract normally (LVEF = 40 %). No masses or thrombi
are seen in the left ventricle
