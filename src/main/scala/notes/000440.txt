Echocardiographic Measurements
Results  Measurements  Normal Range
Mitral Valve - Peak Velocity:  1.3 m/sec
Mitral Valve - Mean Gradient:  4 mm Hg

Findings
LEFT ATRIUM: Mild spontaneous echo contrast in the body of the
LA. No mass/thrombus in the [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] LAA. Good (>20 cm/s) LAA
ejection velocity.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: No mass or thrombus in the RA
or RAA. Mild spontaneous echo contrast in the RAA. No ASD by 2D
or color Doppler.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Depressed LVEF.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: RV function depressed.

AORTA: No atheroma in ascending aorta. No atheroma in aortic
arch. Simple atheroma in descending aorta.

AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets. Mild (1+)
AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Mitral valve annuloplasty ring. Well-seated mitral
annular ring with normal gradient. Trivial MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets. Mild [1+] TR.
Normal PA systolic pressure.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflets.
Physiologic (normal) PR.

PERICARDIUM: Trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify I was present in compliance with HCFA
regulations. The patient was monitored by a nurse [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 9833**]
throughout the procedure. Local anesthesia was provided by
benzocaine topical spray. The posterior pharynx was anesthetized
with 2% viscous lidocaine. 0.2 mg of IV glycopyrrolate was given
as an antisialogogue prior to TEE probe insertion. No TEE
related complications. The rhythm appears to be atrial flutter.
Cardiology fellow involved with the patient's care was notified
by telephone.
Conclusions
Mild spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body of the left
atrium. No mass/thrombus is seen in the left atrium or left
atrial appendage. No mass or thrombus is seen in the right
atrium or right atrial appendage. Mild spontaneous echo contrast
is seen in the right atrial appendage. No atrial septal defect
is seen by 2D or color Doppler. LV systolic function appears
depressed. There is depressed right ventricular free wall
contractility. There are simple atheroma in the descending
thoracic aorta. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. A mitral valve
annuloplasty ring is present. The mitral annular ring appears
well seated and is not obstructing flow. Trivial mitral
regurgitation is seen. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic
pressure is normal. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial
effusion.

IMPRESSION: No intracardiac thrombus. Depressed biventricular
systolic function. Mild aortic regurgitation.
Normally-functioning mitral annuloplasty ring.

CHEST (PA & LAT)

Reason: evaluate for ? effusion

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
60 year old man with s/p cabg
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
evaluate for ? effusion
HISTORY: Status post CABG.

FINDINGS: In comparison with study of [**3-21**], the right IJ central
venous catheter has been removed. Some residual enlargement of
the cardiac silhouette with some atelectatic streaks at the left
base. No evidence of pleural effusion.


Brief Hospital Course:
He was taken to the operating room on [**3-18**] where he underwent a
CABG x 4 and MV Repair. He was transferred to the ICU in
critical but stable condition on milrinone, levophed,
vasopressin and epinephrine. He was extubated on POD #1. He was
transfused. His vasoactive drips were weaned to off by POD #3.
He developed atrial flutter. He was pancultured for a fever. He
was transferred to the floor on POD #3. He was seen by
electrophysiology, and started on heparin and coumadin. He
underwent TEE and cardioversion on [**3-25**] with return to NSR. He
was ready for discharge home on POD #8.
