CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Multiple falls and chest pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 56-year-old male with
multiple medical problems including diabetes mellitus, end
stage renal disease, who was recently discharged from
rehabilitation with an episode of hypoglycemia.  Since
discharge, he has had multiple falls, which he describes as
being unstable.  He bumps into something, he becomes shaky
and falls.  He does not describe any postural association
with his falls nor does he become dizzy.  He says it is
partly due to his external fixation on lower right extremity
for tibiofibular fracture with nonunion.  Since Saturday, he
has noticed that he has not felt well and describes the
feeling as similar to episodes of hypoglycemia, no dizziness,
nausea or vomiting, however, when his blood sugar is
measured, it has been greater than 300s, only once in the
90s.  He admits to using a sliding scale and his nightly dose
has been normal for him at around 10-15 units.

Reportedly, he went to rehabilitation again yesterday and
came back okay.  But once again, fell in the kitchen, sat
down, sat up, and fell back again.  Rehabilitation nurse
called to check up on him and recommended going into the
hospital.  Patient called for transport.  He admits to having
intermittent chest pain, not associated with falls.  Chest
pain is nonexertional and does not produce shortness of
breath, but feels like pressure which begins in the center of
his chest and moves to the left scapula region.  No radiation
to the jaw.  Patient reports that he can reproduce his pain
with arm movement, however, nurse at outside hospital
suggested trying a nitroglycerin tablet which patient did,
only with help after two hours.

In the Emergency Room, patient's course was remarkable for
receiving Kayexalate for hyperkalemia.  Potassium was reduced
from 7.4 to 6.4.  Also insulin D50, calcium gluconate were
added.

1.  Past medical history:
2.  Diabetes mellitus.

14. Wellbutrin 100 mg po t.i.d.
15. Tylenol.
16. Insulin subcutaneously q.d.
17. Regular insulin sliding scale.

ALLERGIES:  Codeine, Prograf, Phenergan and Haldol.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  He lives with his wife at home.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs:  Afebrile.  Blood
pressure 180/.100.  Heart rate 61.  Respiratory rate 16.
Oxygen saturation 99% on room air.  General exam:  In no
acute distress, appears comfortable.  Cardiovascular exam:
Regular rate and rhythm, 1/6 systolic murmur at the right
upper sternal border, no rubs or gallops.  Pulmonary exam:
CTA bilaterally.  No wheezes, crackles or ralese.
Gastrointestinal exam:  Good bowel sounds, nontender,
nondistended, no hepatosplenomegaly.  Extremities:  Bilateral
venous stasis changes, left toe amputation, right lower
extremity external fixation, 1+ pitting edema bilaterally and
dorsalis pedis not appreciated bilaterally.  Neurological
exam:  Cranial nerves II through XII are intact.  No
asterixes.

LABORATORIES:  White blood cell count 9.2 with a normal
differential.  Hematocrit of 38, platelet count 288,000.
Sodium 139, potassium initially 7.3, decreased to 6.4 in the
Emergency Room.  Chloride of 103, bicarbonate 26, BUN 37,
creatinine of 8.3 and a glucose of 69.  His coagulation
studies showed a PT of 13, PTT 29.3, INR 1.1.  CKs were
initially measured at 46 with an MB fraction of 3 and
troponin of 0.02.  A incidental right lower lobe pneumonia
was found on CT with small effusion and electrocardiogram
showed sinus rhythm at 64 with biphasic T waves in V2 through
V5 with deeper inversions on V4 and V5.

ANALYSIS OF PLAN AND SUMMARY:  This is a 56-year-old male
with multiple medical problems including diabetes mellitus,
end stage renal disease with multiple falls and chest pain.
Chest pain was evaluated by serial enzymes.  Initial set was
negative, as well as subsequent two sets.  Currently on
aspirin, Lopressor and Lipitor.  He states his last stress
was in [**2138-2-21**].  We performed another stress test in
light of this on presentation and given risk factors involved
in his history.

Hyperkalemia and end stage renal disease:  Currently on
Dialysis on Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday's.  We checked
potassium after hemodialysis which had stabilized.  We
discontinued Kayexalate and continued on telemetry to monitor
for signs of any electrocardiogram changes.  He was being
treated with levofloxacin.  Will treat up to seven days.
Currently he is on the seventh day.

Diabetes mellitus:  Given his tenuous blood sugars, we
continued him initially on his home dose, which he continued
to be hyperglycemia with an put him on diabetic diet, as well
as continued him on his insulin sliding scale.

Hypertension:  Hypertension was treated with his normal
regimen.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  [**Hospital **] hospital course was unremarkable.
He initially ruled out by enzymes times three.  Given the
patient's history of diabetes and questionable history, T
MIBI was performed which resulted in his baseline
electrocardiogram changes with no signs of myocardial
ischemia.  He continued to receive hemodialysis throughout
the hospital stay.  On Friday, patient was increasingly
confused and agitated and after rounds became more
dysarthric.  A CT was performed to evaluate for signs of CVA
during which the patient became unresponsive.  We immediately
wheeled him back to nursing.  Blood sugar fingerstick was
performed which was 29.  The patient received multiple amps
of D50 which only temporarily corrected his sugars.  He was
sent to the Intensive Care Unit for closer monitoring.
During his Intensive Care Unit stay, his blood sugars
continued to dip into the 40s and 50s and any exogenous
insulin that was administered many resulted in hypoglycemic
episodes.  After a while, patient stabilized and was able to
maintain blood sugars in the normal range.

In regards to the patient's multiple falls, he has mechanical
reasons for falling including his external fixation,
diabetes, peripheral neuropathy, as well as his left toe
amputation.  Patient should be evaluated at rehabilitation
until he is more stable on his feet.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Stable.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  To rehabilitation.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Rule out myocardial infarction.
2.  Hypoglycemia.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  Same as above with the exception of
insulin, which is now 2 units of glargine q.h.s., as well as
a regular insulin sliding scale.
