Chief Complaint:
dyspnea, SOB

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 56 yo M with a history of PE's (has had two in
distant past, w/u supposedly negative).  He presented yesterday
with dyspnea to [**Hospital1 **] ED, where he was found to have
a large saddle embolus on CTA.  He was started on a heparin drip
and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]. In the ED here, VS were 95% on 4L, RR
20-22, T 97.7, HR 105, BP 129/86.  Troponin was 0.02.

Of note, he has been progressively SOB for the last month.
Three-plus weeks ago he presented to his PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 1023**] felt obtained
a CXR (which was negative) and prescribed Xanax for anxiety.
Over the holidays he developed URI sx with rhinorrhea and
eventually a productive cough.  He was also scheduled for a
stress test by his PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 6643**] he never went to because of his
cold sx.  Last week, he returned to his PCP office when he was
given an inhaler and a nasal steroid.  the night PTA, he felt
severely SOB walking up a flight of steps when he went to bed,
and the morning of admission, he called the paramedics after
feeling severely SOB walking to work.

He has not had long flights recently (last was to Bermuda in
[**8-19**]) or leg swelling, denied trauma to legs.  Smoked some
cigars last summer, but never a cigarette smoker.  Colonoscopy
was 3 years ago (two adenomatous polyps removed).  No known
prostate history.  No family history of clotting disorder.

ROS:
Negative for CP, back/abd pain, nausea, diaphoresis, F/C.  Has
had 10 lb weight loss in last month but also admitted to
decreased PO intake with cold.

sats, uses CPAP overnight

RADIOLOGY:
[**2176-12-19**] CTA from OSH: large saddle embolus with extension into
the left PA segments
[**2176-12-19**] CXR: clear, NAD; + vascular markings

ECHO:
The left atrium is normal in size. The estimated right atrial
pressure is 10-20mmHg. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is unusually small.
Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). The
estimated cardiac index is borderline low (2.0-2.5L/min/m2).
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal left ventricular
filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). The right ventricular cavity is
markedly dilated with focal basal free wall hypokinesis
([**Last Name (un) **] sign). There is abnormal septal motion/position
consistent with right ventricular pressure/volume overload. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral
regurgitation. There is no mitral valve prolapse. There is
severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Underfilled left ventricle with normal systolic and
diastolic function (apparent hypertrophy likely a result of
underfilling). Markely dilated right ventricle with basal
hypokinesis. Severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.

BILATERAL LOWER EXTREMITY VENOUS ULTRASOUND: Grayscale and color
Doppler
son[**Name (NI) 493**] images were obtained that demonstrate the bilateral
common
femoral, superficial femoral, greater saphenous veins are
compressible with wall-to-wall flow and normal response to
respiration and augmentation. There is a occlusive thrombus in
the right popliteal that extends into the right posterior tibial
and peroneal veins. On the left the popliteal vein is
compressible with wall-to-wall flow and normal response to
respiration and augmentation and calf veins are visualized.
IMPRESSION: Occlusive thrombus of the right popliteal, posterior
tibial and peroneal veins.


Brief Hospital Course:
(#) Saddle PE:  Patient was started on heparin drip and
Coumadin.  He was transitioned from the heparin drip to Lovenox
and continued on his Coumadin.  A echo showed evidence of right
heart strain but he remained hemodynamically stable.  LENIs
showed that he had a DV.  An IVC filter was discussed but as he
had not failed Coumadin therapy the decision was made to
anticoagulate him for life.  He will have his INR followed at
his PCPs office.
.
Per the patient he has had a hypercoagulable work up done in the
past which was negative.  He was not set up with a hematologist
as he will need lifelong anticoagulation at this point.  The
decision to do any further workup for a hypercoagulable state
was deferred to his PCP and the patient.
.
(#) COUGH: Was not thought to be infectious.  He remained
afebrile and without an elevated white count.  The cough was
thought be related either to a UTI or lung irritation from the
PE.  He was treated symptomatically with Tessalon pearls and
codeine.
.
