HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient underwent an ileal colostomy on
[**2148-12-24**].  Postoperatively, the patient had oozing,
and was hypotensive for about 12 hours because his sedation
was now reversed.  The patient's pressure finally increased.
The patient had done well for five days postoperatively, but
on [**2148-12-29**], the patient started to have ileus.

The patient then started to manifest supraventricular
tachycardia, and started having new onset acute abdominal
pain.  Pulmonary embolus and myocardial infarction were ruled
out despite his supraventricular tachycardia.  The patient
was then taken to the Operating Room on [**2148-12-31**] for
an exploratory laparotomy, lysis of adhesions, drainage of a
pelvic abscess, closure of the enterotomy, removal of penile
prosthesis, and ileostomy.

Postoperatively, the patient was admitted to the ICU for
management.  The patient was found to have a Pseudomonas
tracheobronchitis in the ICU.  The patient was treated
appropriately.  The patient was extubated on [**2149-1-21**],
and was started on tube feeds.  The patient remained in the
Surgical Intensive Care Unit secondary to multiple medical
issues.

On [**2149-2-18**], the patient was transferred out of the
Surgical Intensive Care Unit to the floor.  The patient was
tolerating tube feeds, and was stable both hemodynamically
and pulmonary wise.  The patient was ready for discharge on
[**2149-2-22**] to [**Hospital3 537**].
