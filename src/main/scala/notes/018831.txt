Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1145**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of Breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
70yo Chinese speaking man with history of previous IMI [**2134**],
hypertension, and borderline diabetes, recent admission for
dyspnea found to have CAD with 3VD, EF of 20% and 3+MR and 2+AR
with plan for medical management of CAD/CHF.

He presented with SOB. In ED initially felt to be in CHF and
siuresed. THen found to have several subsegmental PE's. He
required a NRB for a time. He was transferred to the CCU with
hypotension. Given his poor cardiac function, it was felt he was
hemodynamically unstable and would benefit from lysis of PE. TPA
and heparin administered. Afterwards, he developed a hematoma on
L groin site in area of prior catheterization. This responded to
pressure. He remained hemodynamically stable with several small
IVF boluses.

ABD CT
INDICATION: Right upper quadrant pain
IMPRESSION: Technically limited exam with no gallstones
identified. There is apparent mild/moderate bilateral
hydronephrosis, right greater than left and likley due to high
post-void residual.

EKG: Baseline artifact. Sinus tachycardia. Left axis deviation.
Non-specific
intraventricular conduction delay. Left atrial abnormality. Q
waves in the
inferior leads with possible ST segment elevation. Non-specific
lateral
ST-T wave changes. Compared to the previous tracing of [**2145-6-26**]
possible
inferior ST segment elevation is new. If ischemia is a clinical
concern, a
repeat tracing is recommended.

[**2145-6-29**]
CXR: IMPRESSION:
1. Persistent CHF.
2. Stable left lower lobe opacity, probably representing
atelectasis.

6/22/05CT reconstruction
IMPRESSION:
1. Bilateral pulmonary emboli as described above.
2. Multiple right-sided lung nodules. In the absence of known
malignancy, followup CT scan in 12 months may be performed. In
the presence of primary malignancy, followup scan in 3 months
may be performed.
3. Multiple likely bilateral renal cysts.
4. Small hypodense lesion in the inferior portion of the spleen,
too small to characterize, that may represent a small
hemangioma.
5. Aneyrusmal dilatation of the common iliac arteries

[**2145-7-4**]
EKGSinus rhythm. Left axis deviation. Non-specific
intraventricular conduction
delay. Left atrial abnormality. Q waves in the inferior leads
consistent with
prior inferior myocardial infarction. Non-specific anterior and
lateral
ST-T wave changes. Compared to the previous tracing of [**2145-6-30**]
ST-T wave
changes are more extensive.



Brief Hospital Course:
1) Pulmonary Emboli - As stated in the HPI, the patient
presented with SOB and some right epigastric vs. pleuritic chest
pain.  A CTA was done with showed multiple bilateral pulmonary
emboli, and due to the patients SOB and hypotension in the
setting of severe ischemic cardiomyopathy, the patient given
lysis treatment with tPA.  He was started on Heparin for
anticoagulation and transitioned to coumadin by discharge.  His
symptoms of SOB improved daily and his breathing was baseline at
discharge.

2) CHF - The patient has known ischemic cardiomyopathy with NYHA
Class III CHF.  Initially many of his medications were held due
to hypotension, but as the patient's BP stabalized and he
clinically improved, he was placed back on all of the
medications from prior hospitalization, including lasix,
sprinolactone, lisinopril, and carvedilol, and imdur.

3) CAD - known 2 VD, not surgical candidate, s/p failure of PTCA
attempt.  EKG c/w pulmonary emboli with no evidence of acute or
ongoing ischemia during hospitalization.  Continued to optimize
medical management of patient with ASA, plavix, atrovastatin,
carvedilol, lisinopril, imdur, SL nitro PRN, and above
medications.

4) Hyperglycemia - the patient showed evidence of glucose
intolerance.  A converstaion was had regarding the need to
treat, and it was decided that while the patient was inhospital
with sickness that could elevate blood sugars, treatment was not
felt to be necessary.  However, this decision was made with the
idea that the patient would have the issued addressed more fully
as an outpt.

5) FEN - SBP remained 90-100's.  Ate a cardiac/heart healthy
diet.  Received daily potassium.

6) PPX - heparin to prevent DVT's and PPI to prevent stress
ulcer

7) Dispo - discharged home to son's place in [**Location (un) **], wife
accompanying.  F/U scheduled with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on Friday [**7-9**] at 2:30 pm at [**Hospital6 733**] in [**Hospital Ward Name 23**] 6.
Additional f/u on [**7-19**] with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] of cardiology and [**7-26**]
with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 3037**] in [**Hospital 191**] clinic.  VNA will follow patient's INR in
meantime and call Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 3037**] to make decision regarding coumadin
dosing.
