Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5810**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath and chest tightness

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
84M year old male with past medical history of COPD, CAD s/p MI,
HTN, HL and recent hospitalization for bronchitis who presents
with shortness of breath and "burning" chest tightness. Pt
reported 2 weeks of chest discomfort, productive cough, +SOB and
chills in the ED but tells this interviewer that the tightness
has been going on for months. He denies cough or chills but
endorses shortness of breath that is worse with lying down and
improved when standing up. He notes that food makes him feel
better. He also notes that his inhalers he uses at home have not
been helping. Pt is poor historian, difficult to elicit
specifics of chest pain. Denies fevers, nausea, vomiting,
abdominal pain, leg swelling. Not on home O2. Reports recent
fall that he attributes to "dizziness" he gets when he gets out
of bed. Lives at home but says he was hospitalized 1 month ago
for bronchitis. Pt reports he was supposed to go to the [**Location 10050**] VA this morning for an appointment (with what looks like
to have been for an ECHO based on paperwork he has), but when he
went there with his current symptoms they sent him here. In the
ED, he reported that he went to the wrong VA because apparently
the ER moved after he was there last.

In [**Hospital1 18**] ED VS were T 98.2, BP 121/77, P 90, R 16, O2 sat 97.
Labs were remarkable for negative troponin. EKG was not
concerning for a STEMI. Pt was given 1L NS. He was also given
levofloxacin and vancomycin out of concern for pneumonia based
on retrocardiac opacity from a wet read of chest x-ray. Vitals
on transfer were 122/34, 88, 23, 98% 3L.

On arrival to the floor, vitals were T 96.0, BP 130/70, P 88,
18, O2 100 3L NC. Pt states he feels much improved. Currently
feeling well, but describes a feeling of chest tightness that he
attributes to [**Hospital1 9813**].

MICROBIOLOGY
[**2165-11-5**] Blood cultures x2: NGTD
[**2165-11-5**] MRSA SCREEN (Final [**2165-11-8**]): No MRSA isolated.

IMAGING
[**2165-11-5**] 7:06 AM EKG: Normal sinus rhythm. Left atrial
abnormality. Q waves in leads V1-V4 with ST segment elevation in
those leads. Q waves in leads I and aVL. No previous tracing
available for comparison. Tracing is consistent with an
anteroseptal infarction of undetermined age.

[**2165-11-5**] ECHO (EF 15-20%) The left atrium is markedly dilated.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. There is severe
regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with basal to mid
and apical anteroseptal, anterior and lateral wall
hypokinesis/akinesis. Right ventricular chamber size and free
wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened without significant stenosis. Mild (1+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
[Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation
may be significantly UNDERestimated.] The pulmonary artery
systolic pressure could not be determined. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Moderately dilated left ventricle with severe
regional LV systolic dysfunction in the distribution of the
proximal LAD. Moderate to severe mitral regurgitation. Mild
aortic regurgitation.

[**2165-11-5**] CHEST (PA & LAT): PA and lateral views of the chest
were provided. There is no focal consolidation or pneumothorax.
There is evidence of mild pulmonary edema as demonstrated by
prominence of the pulmonary vasculature and Kerley B lines. The
heart size is enlarged. There are small bilateral pleural
effusions as well as small amount of fluid within the right
minor fissure. Surgical clips are seen in the right upper
quadrant likely from prior cholecystectomy.

[**2165-11-5**] CHEST (PORTABLE AP): Widespread relatively symmetric
basal predominant heterogeneous pulmonary opacification is most
likely worsening moderate to severe pulmonary edema. Heart is
only moderately enlarged. Left pleural calcifications should not
be mistaken for lung nodules, but given the extensive pleural
and parenchymal abnormalities, significant lung lesions could be
missed. Presence of central adenopathy cannot be assessed.

[**2165-11-6**] 6:57 AM EKG: Normal sinus rhythm. Compared to tracing
#1 there is no diagnostic interval change. The tracing continues
to show Q waves in leads V1-V4 consistent with a prior
anteroseptal myocardial infarction of undetermined age.

Brief Hospital Course:
84 yo M w/ PMH HTN, HL, CAD s/p MI who initially p/w shortness
of breath and chest tightness, sent to CCU for flash pulmonary
edema in the setting of hypertension likely secondary to
paroxysmal cough, and thought to have COPD exacerbation, on
azithromycin, though with an element of CHF exacerbation.

ACTIVE ISSUES
# Flash Pulmonary Edema - Pt was transferred to the CCU after
experiencing [**9-7**] chest tightness, dyspnea with desaturation to
the 70's, hypertension, and diaphoresis with concern f
