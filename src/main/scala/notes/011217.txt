Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2569**]
Chief Complaint:
AMS, R gaze deviation and nystagmus

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
The pt is a 75 year-old  woman with a PMH of a prior L MCA
infarct ([**2124**]) with reported residual Wernicke's aphasia. She
also has a PMH of HTN, hypothyroidism, possible SSS s/p pacer
and
recent ARF. She was brought here this morning after being found
"unresponsive" at her NH.

I attempted to get further history from her NH as there was no
EMS transfer record. Per their report, she was last well the
evening prior. This morning she did not come down for breakfast,
[**Name6 (MD) **] the RN went to check on her at around 9:20 or 9:30. She found
her sitting without a facial droop, weakness or eye deviation
awake but "not really responding". She described her as opening
her eyes to voice and touch and mumbling but not understandably.
She was also not following commands. She seemed to be able to
mover her eyes laterally in both directions but not tracking.
She
was also noted to be "snoring" and puffing her cheeks. EMS was
called and she was brought here.

I attempted to reach her brother who is her HCP but there was
only a voice mail without an identifying name so I did not leave
a message. I also contact[**Name (NI) **] her PCP, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **].[**Name (NI) 51133**] office, and
spoke briefly with the covering physician who could not provide
further details.

In our ED she was febrile to 101.8, HR in the 80's but her BP
ranged from 160-200/50's (wide pulse pressure). Her BS was 131.
She was given 1mg of ativan without effect. She was given
empiric
vanc and gent prior to LP.

Of note, Ms. [**Known lastname 28272**] was last discharged on [**3-4**] from [**Hospital1 18**]
after
an admission for ARF after prepping for a colonoscopy. Her Cr on
discharge was 1.0. She was last seen by neurology in [**2124**]. At
that time she was being evaluated for her recent stroke w/
residual aphasia but no clear evidence of weakness or other
focality.

Per her NH, at baseline she is somewhat dependant in her ADLS
and
has mild dementia (has meals, cleaning and meds done for her but
is able to feed herself). She walks with a walker and per their
report does not have weakness or speech impairments.
