BRIEF HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 68-year-old male
with coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure,
diabetes mellitus, end-stage renal disease (on hemodialysis),
chronic atrial fibrillation, hyperlipidemia, and
hypertension.

BRIEF SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
He was admitted to the Cardiac Medicine Service on [**8-5**].
He was taken to the operating room for a 2-vessel coronary
artery bypass grafting (left internal mammary artery to left
anterior descending and saphenous vein graft to obtuse
marginal branch).  He also had a mitral valve repair.

The procedure went well, but he was extremely labile
postoperatively, requiring catecholamine support with
milrinone, epinephrine, norepinephrine, and phenylephrine, as
well as vasopressin.  The first day postoperatively, he had a
ventricular tachycardia event which responded to 360 joules
of direct current cardioversion.

The patient was followed by Cardiology throughout his course,
and they took him to the Catheterization Laboratory on [**8-8**]
(postoperative day two) where he had a totally occluded
circumflex, a proximally occluded right coronary artery, and
a total occlusion apically in the left anterior descending,
and grafts were down.  Stents were placed, and a balloon pump
was placed as well.

The patient continued to remain hemodynamically unstable.
After long discussions with the patient's family, and
support, they elected to withdraw support - providing him
with comfort care only.  The patient expired at 12:05 p.m. on
[**2160-8-10**].

The patient's wife, [**Name (NI) **], has requested a postmortem
examination.  I have spoken with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 70**]
throughout the process, and he has been intimately involved.
He has spoken with the wife as well.
