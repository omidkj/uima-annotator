Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 783**]
Chief Complaint:
OSH transfer for ? pulomonary stent

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Rigid and flex bronchoscopy, with biopsy
s/p 2 right sided chest tubes


History of Present Illness:
83F h/o HTN, CHF, and recent afib s/p PM implantation who was
transferred to [**Hospital3 17921**] Center on [**2113-5-31**] with 1 week of
lightheadeness and episodes of syncope. Creatinine was 1.0, BUN
22.
.
CXR and BNP were consistent with CHF, and TTE showed valve area
of 0.75cm2, moderate MR, and EF 55%. LHC on [**5-31**] revealed RCA
lesion of 60%. The decision was made to pursue aortic valve
replacement on [**6-6**] with a tissue valve, and ascending aorta
endarterectomy. She was extubated on [**6-7**].
.
Her post-operative course was complicated by worsening pulmoanry
function, cough, ?RUL PNA on CXR, and rising WBC to 17K, with
concern of retained secretions, and poor cough. On [**6-9**], she
underwent bronchoscopy to evaluate for concern for retained
secretions, at which time thick secretions, which showed
purulent secretions, for which broad spectrum abx were started,
and pt was started on BiPaP.
.
She was also noted to have bilateral pleural fluid collections,
ultimately resulting in left thoracentesis [**6-8**] (250cc
serosang), left [**Female First Name (un) 576**] on [**6-12**], right side 20 french chest tube on
[**6-13**], right side anteriolateral thoracentesis [**6-14**] (100cc serous
fluid), left thoracentesis on [**6-5**], and [**6-25**] (250cc serous).
.
She continued to do poorly from a respiratory standpoint, and CT
on [**6-26**] was concerning for right side hemothorax, prompting
right thoracotomy and VATs with decortication of the right lung,
evacuation of right hemothorax, and repair of the right lung
with a xenograft.
.
On [**6-29**], repeat bronchoscopy was performed which revealed marked
thickening and narrowing of the right main and intermediate
bronchus, with concern of a mass compressing the right maintstem
bronchus. Per d/c summary, the endobronchaial papearance
suggested the possibility of neoplasm, and material was
aspirated, but biopsy was deferred [**2-13**] INR 1.8.
.
The patient was also seen by general surgery on [**6-18**] for
?abdominal pain in the setting of kayexalate induced stooling
for hyperkalemia, however she denied abdominal pain upon repeat
questioning, and no further intervention was performed. She was
seen by nephrology pre-operatively with plan to hold lasix, ACE,
and potassium. By report, she is alert, and interactive, though
had been increasingly tachypneic, agitated on BiPaP was was
therefore intubated prior to transfer.
.
She is transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for consideration of stenting of the
right minstem and intermediate bronchus with possible
transbronchial biopsy.
.
At the time of her transfer, UOP over past 24 hours was 1065 cc,
chest tube drainiage was 390 cc.

STUDIES:

[**2113-7-1**] CXR
FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**7-2**], the tip of the
endotracheal tube has been pulled back so that it now lies
approximately 3.3 cm above the carina. Nasogastric tube has been
repositioned so that the side hole is well below the
esophagogastric junction. Small right pneumothorax persists with
chest tube in place.
Otherwise, little change in the appearance of the heart and
lungs.
.
[**2113-7-1**] Chest CT
IMPRESSION:
1. Bilateral pleural effusions. The right-sided pleural fluid is
loculated
in the major fissure and also has a component that is higher
attenuation in the dependent aspect, which may represent
hemorrhage or complex fluid.
Recommend correlation with chest tube output.
2. Small 1.2-cm right hilar node. No obstructing bronchus mass,
which was
the clinical concern.
3. Heterogeneous nodular thyroid gland. Recommend non-emergent
thyroid
ultrasound.
4. Complex left renal cystic lesion. Renal ultrasound is
recommended for
additional evaluation.
.
[**7-3**] Rigid and Flex Bronch: No significant central airway
obstruction, narrowing or collapse. Successful transbronchial
needle aspiration of station 11R. Balloon dilatation of right
middle lobe orifice.
.
[**7-3**] U/S LUE: no DVT
.
[**7-3**] ECHO: no obvious vegetation, but can get TEE if suspicion
is high
serial CXRs: unchanged extensive opacification in the right lung
and left lower lobe
.
serial CXRs (last one [**2113-7-7**]): extensive opacities in left
lower lobe and right lung with no interval changes

MICRO:
[**7-1**]: 1 bottle gram pos, coag negative cocci, likely Staph epi

Brief Hospital Course:
83F s/p AVR, with post-op course complicated by respiratory
failure [**2-13**] pulmonary secretions, recurrent bilateral pleural
effusions requiring thoracentesis, and concern for mass
compressing right mainstem bronchus.  Mass not seen on CT or
Bronch, and biopsy showed normal tissue (cartilage, fibrin).
Respiratory failure likely secondary to secretions, CHF, pleural
effusions.
.
# Respiratory Failure - This was likely multifactorial,
attributed to chronic post-op complications with significant
secretions that she is having difficulty clearing, fluid
overload due to acute on chronic systolic CHF, COPD
exacerbation. She continues to have expiratory wheezing/rhonchi
on exam. She had small PTX at R apex with chest tubes in place
that improved, and the chest tubes were subsequently removed by
Thoracic
