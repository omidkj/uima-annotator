[**2116-12-14**]  ECG
Atrial fibrillation with a moderate ventricular response.
Borderline low voltage diffusely. Vertical QRS axis. Slow R wave
progression. Non-specific ST-T wave changes. QTc interval
prolongation. Compared to the previous tracing of [**2115-12-24**] QTc
interval is longer.

[**2116-12-14**] Interventional Radiology:
1. Active bleeding was confirmed angiographically at the hepatic
flexure, best accessed through a middle colic branch coming off
the proximal superior mesenteric artery.

2. Successful embolization of the branch of middle colic artery
with 6 microcoils at the level of marginal artery with good
residual collateral flow at the end of the procedure and
cessation of angiographic extravasation.

[**2116-12-14**] GI bleeding study
IMPRESSION: Positive GI bleeding study with extravasation of
tracer identifiedwithin the region of the hepatic flexure of the
colon.

[**2116-12-15**] CXR Findings consistent with congestive heart failure.

[**2116-12-16**] CXR IMPRESSION: Central venous catheter in satisfactory
position. Endotracheal tube also likely satisfactory allowing
for flexed position of the neck.

2. Worsening congestive heart failure with probable asymmetrical
right perihilar pulmonary edema. Superimposed process such as
aspiration in this area cannot be excluded given the presence of
a large hiatal hernia.

[**2116-12-19**] CXR Right jugular CV line is in mid SVC. There is a
large hiatal hernia as previously demonstrated and probable
atelectases at both lung bases difficult to evaluate in this
single frontal view in the presence of a large hiatal hernia. No
pneumothorax. Surgical clip overlies left superior mediastinum.

Brief Hospital Course:
85F with a h/o afib on coumadin admitted to medicine ICU for
BRBPR.  INR on admission was 4.2 and hct had dropped from 36.5
to 28.3 over 2 hours.  She was given Vitamin K and tranfused
with 5 units of prbcs and 6 units of FFP.  She was taken to IR
where a branch of the middle colic artery was coiled and good
collateral flow identified.  GI was also consulted and
recommended colonscopy if pt continued to bleed.  Although she
did not exhibit continued profuse bleeding per rectum, serial
hematocrits continued to drop despite transfusion and the
decision to take the patient to the OR for a right hemicolectomy
was made.  She tolerated the procedure well and was transferred
to the SICU and remained intubated overnight.  On POD1, pt was
intubated but could answer questions.  She remained in afib with
RVR that did not respond to lopressor and was placed on a
diltiazem infusion.  Her BP was closely monitored.  She
exhibited signs of CHF with pulmonary edema present on CXR.
Geriatrics was also consulted.  On POD2, pt's hct remained
stable and she was diuresed and later extubated.  On POD4, pt
was transferred to floor with telemetry.  She was started on
clears and continued to be diuresed.  The remainder of her
course, pt advanced to regular diet and her pain was controlled
with PO analgesia.  She did express concern regarding going home
alone.  PT was consulted and recommended rehab for 1-3 weeks.
On POD6 pt had purulent drainage from her incision site.  A few
staples were removed and about 20ml of pus necessitated from the
wound.  The wound of opened and cleaned.  No fascia defect was
noted.  The patient was placed on ABx and kept in the hospital
for one more day of observation.  On POD 7, pt was stable and
d/ced to rehab on abx with instructions for [**Hospital1 **] wet-to-dry
dressing changes in stable condition.
