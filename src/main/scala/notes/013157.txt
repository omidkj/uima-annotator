Service:  MEDICINE

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 85-year-old
woman from the [**Hospital **] Rehabilitation facility, who
presented with a proximal femoral shaft fracture.  The
patient fell while walking to the bathroom on the evening
prior to admission.  X-rays on admission revealed a fracture,
as noted below.  The patient was found to be in minimal pain
unless her leg was moved.  The admitting team reported that
the patient denied any headache, neck pain, chest pain or
shortness of breath.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  C3-C4 facet pain.
2.  History of breast cancer, status post bilateral
lumpectomy in [**2139**].
3.  Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
4.  Gait unsteadiness.
5.  Depression.
6.  Urinary incontinence.
7.  Status post L3 compression fracture secondary to fall.
8.  Hypertension.
9.  Degenerative joint disease.

ALLERGIES:  There were no known drug allergies

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is married.  Her husband also
[**Name2 (NI) 546**] at the [**Name (NI) **] Rehabilitation facility.  The patient
normally ambulates with a walker at her baseline.  However, a
recent L3 compression fracture has limited this to some
extent.  The patient's primary care physician is [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 34013**].  Her son is [**Name (NI) **] Trust; his cell phone number is
[**Telephone/Fax (1) 109480**] and his home phone number is [**Telephone/Fax (1) 109481**].  The
patient's son has been very involved in the patient's care.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION (as obtained by the
orthopedics team):  Vital signs revealed a temperature of
98.2??????F, a heart rate of 84, a blood pressure of 146/72,
respirations of 18 and an oxygen saturation of 94% on room
air.  In general, the patient was an 85-year-old woman in no
acute distress.  The head was normocephalic and atraumatic.
The pupils were equal and reactive to light.  The neck was
supple with no cervical spine tenderness.

The chest was clear to auscultation bilaterally.  The
cardiovascular examination revealed an S1 and S2 without
murmurs, rubs or gallops.  The abdomen was soft, nontender
and nondistended.  The left leg was tender to palpation and
movement; there was a 2+ dorsalis pedis pulse with positive
capillary refill.  Sensation was intact.  No bruising was
visible.

LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION:  The CBC revealed a white blood
cell count of 11,100 with a hematocrit of 32.3 and platelet
count of 399,000.  Chem 7 revealed a sodium of 131, potassium
of 5.7 (which was hemolyzed), chloride of 95, bicarbonate of
21, BUN of 19, creatinine of 1.1 and glucose of 142.
Coagulation studies revealed a prothrombin time of 12.8,
partial thromboplastin time of 31.3 and INR of 1.1.

RADIOLOGY DATA ON ADMISSION:  A left hip film revealed a
proximal femur fracture that was medially displaced and
shortened.  A left knee film revealed degenerative joint
disease without any visible fracture.  A chest x-ray revealed
retrocardiac atelectasis.  A lumbar spine film revealed no
acute fractures.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was initially admitted to the
orthopedics team, where she was put in Buck traction at five
pounds.  She was prepared for the operating room.  On the
following day, [**2155-8-16**], the patient underwent an
intermedullary rod placement for her left subtrochanteric
fracture (Gamma nail).  This was performed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].

The patient's postoperative course was complicated by what
was initially felt to be atrial fibrillation although, on
further review, only the fact that the patient had an
occasional irregular heart rhythm could be determined.  It
was felt that the patient had a rapid ventricular response
and that she had experienced some hemodynamic instability.
The patient responded to Lopressor and converted back to a
normal sinus rhythm.

On the next morning, [**2155-8-17**], the patient became
hypotensive with systolic blood pressures ranging in the 60s
to 70s.  Her hypotension responded to two 250 cc boluses of
normal saline.  The patient at this time had an oxygen
saturation of 97% on three liters by nasal cannula.

The medicine team was consulted and found abdominal
tenderness.  A subsequent KUB was reportedly negative.  An
electrocardiogram was performed and revealed nonischemic
sinus rhythm.  A chest x-ray at that time revealed
cardiomegaly and revascularization as well as left lower lobe
infiltrate and a possible right lower lobe infiltrate.
Furthermore, the patient was found to have a urinary tract
infection, which grew out enterococcus.  Later on the evening
of [**2155-8-17**], the patient was noted to be somnolent.
The neurology team was consulted and felt that the patient's
somnolence was secondary to her urinary tract infection
and/or her medications.  The patient was placed on Levaquin
to address her pneumonia and vancomycin to address her
enterococcal urinary tract infection.

Also, over the course of [**2155-8-17**], the patient was
noted to have her hematocrit drop from 32 to 21 with her
stools being guaiac negative.  Thus, the patient underwent an
abdominal, pelvic and thigh CT scan.  The CT scan was
negative for significant bleeding anywhere in the abdomen and
pelvic, including the retroperitoneum.  There was no hematoma
evident at the left thigh on CT scan, although probable
bleeding was noted.  (However, this was felt by the
radiologist not to be sufficient enough to justify the drop
in hematocrit.)  The patient was subsequently transfused two
units of packed red blood cells and her hematocrit rose to 28
for the next two hematocrit checks.  On the afternoon of
[**2155-8-18**], the patient was transferred to the
medicine service and the medicine floor.

HOSPITAL COURSE SPECIFIC TO MEDICINE SERVICE:  Following is a
summary of the patient's course while on the medicine
service, reviewed by problem list:

1.  CARDIOVASCULAR:
    a)  Pump and blood pressure issues:  The patient, as
noted above, was somewhat hypotensive over the day and
evening of [**2155-8-17**].  Her hypotension responded to
fluid boluses.  Over the remaining days of the patient's
hospitalization, her blood pressure was stable for the most
part, although she did experience one or two limited episodes
of hypotension which were responsive to further fluid
loading.

    b)  Rate and rhythm issues:  The patient had an
undocumented history of possible atrial fibrillation
postoperatively.  Upon transfer to the medicine floor, the
patient was monitored on telemetry and the cardiology service
was consultation.  Telemetry did reveal that the patient had
an occasional irregular rhythm with premature ventricular
contractions; however, the cardiology consultant felt that,
for the most part, the patient's rhythm was normal and that
there was no indication for current anticoagulation.
(Nonetheless, it should be noted that the patient was on
Lovenox anyway, since she was status post hip surgery.)  If
the patient's heart rate and rhythm again become irregular,
the patient may need to be followed in the atrial
fibrillation clinic.  Her heart rate was well controlled, for
the most part, with occasional runs of tachycardia to
110-120.  These tachycardic runs were brief.

2.  INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  The patient exhibited occasional low
grade temperatures.  She received five days of vancomycin for
her enterococcal urinary tract infection.  A subsequent urine
culture was negative for any bacterial growth.  The patient
had been started on Levaquin for her apparent pneumonia on
chest x-ray.  A follow up chest x-ray on [**2155-8-20**]
revealed no evidence of pneumonia.  The patient should finish
a ten day course of Levaquin.

3.  HEMATOLOGY:  The pa
