Brief Hospital Course:
Neurology and neurosurgery were consulted regarding the
possibility of C1 fracture seen on Cspine CT at OSH. Repeat Ct
showed nonunion of previous C1 fracture involving the anterior
and posterior arches. Per neuro reccs a methylprednisolone drip
was started and pt was kept in a hard collar. A MRI of the C
spine was obtained. Pt was intubated [**1-29**] agitation during MRI.
The study showed elevated T2 signal at C3-C4 interspace c/w
acute v chronic injury. After this read at neurosurgery's
recommendation the methylprednisolone drip was stopped and pt
was transferred to the floor from the TSICU. Neurosurgery
recommended the pt remain CSI x 6 weeks and f/u with them for
repeat imaging for 4 weeks.

Neurology was consulted when the pt developed tingling
sensations along his L side. They recommended performing a MRI
of the brain, which was normal. The pt's symptoms improved and
Neurology will continue to follow the pt as an outpatient.

Physical therapy consulted on the pt and felt he was unsafe to
return home [**1-29**] his chronic R hemiparesis. The pt insisted that
he was safe at home. Therefore, PT evaluated him with all of his
home equipment. He continued to show an inability to function at
home s difficulty. Therefore, the pt agreed to go to rehab for
further therapy. A bed was arranged and the pt was transferred
to rehab in improved condition.
