denied dizziness, reported only hunger and headache.  Found to
have hyperkalemia to 6.8 (already scheduled for [**Month/Year (2) 2286**] today)
with peaked T waves on EKG.  She was given Labetalol 10mg x1, Ca

IV load. K improved to 5.7.  Head CT demonstrated subdural

[**1-23**] 9 am CT head: New bifrontal extra-axial fluid collections,
compatible with acute on subacute
subdural hematomas. Alternatively, these could represent acute
hemorrhage
within established subdural hygromas. There may be a component
of acute
epidural hematomas, particularly anteriorly where the morphology
is more
biconvex.
.
[**1-23**] 8:24 pm CT head: hange in configuration of acute-on-chronic
bilateral subdural
hematomas; either stable or minimally-increased in size
(allowing for
differences in positioning).
.
[**1-24**] CT head: 1. Stable appearance of bilateral extra-axial fluid
collections which
represent either acute-on-chronic bilateral subdural hematomas
or relate to
anticoagulation at time of presentation.
2. Bilateral small parafalcine subdural hematomas, unchanged.
.
[**1-26**] CT head: 1. Stable acute on chronic bilateral subdural
hematomas.
2. Bilateral small parafalcine subdural hematomas, which are
unchanged.
.
[**1-23**] CXR: No evidence of acute pulmonary edema. Focal opacity
seen in the
left lower lobe, nonspecific but could represent aspiration or
pneumonia.
.
[**1-28**] CXR: IMPRESSION: Minimal patchy retrocardiac density is
stable -- ?
atelectasis/scarring or less likely a pneumonic infiltrate. The
lungs are
otherwise clear.

      STAPHYLOCOCCUS, COAGULASE NEGATIVE.    FINAL
SENSITIVITIES.
         Staphylococcus species may develop resistance during
prolonged
         therapy with quinolones.   Therefore, isolates that are
initially
         susceptible may become resistant within three to four
days after
         initiation of therapy.  Testing of repeat isolates may
be
         warranted.

Brief Hospital Course:
Assessment and Plan: An 80 year old with DM, ESRD and history of
subdural hematomas presents with HA found to have new
acute/subacute hematomas and hyperkalemia with altered mental
status. Also with Bacteremia. Hemodynamically stable, K normal,
MS cleared when transfered to the floor
.
