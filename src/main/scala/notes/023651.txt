Admission Date:  [**2152-11-19**]       Discharge Date:  [**2152-11-24**]

Date of Birth:   [**2075-12-17**]       Sex:  F

Service:  CCU

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  The patient was admitted with a chief
complaint of congestive heart failure.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 76 year old
woman with a history of congestive heart failure secondary to
diastolic dysfunction and valvular disease, severe aortic
stenosis, status post balloon valvuloplasty on [**2152-9-19**].  The patient was noted at that time to have mild
coronary artery disease on cardiac catheterization.  After
the valvuloplasty her aortic valve area was 1.2 cm squared.
The patient was discharged to rehabilitation after that
procedure.  The patient was in rehabilitation on [**11-18**]
when she awoke with 7 out of 10 epigastric pain, nausea,
shortness of breath, and a cough productive of yellow sputum.
Two sets of enzymes were checked at the rehabilitation
facility and a troponin I leak was noted with a level of up
to 7.0.  Creatinine kinase were flat at that time.  The
patient was then transferred to the [**Hospital3 417**] Hospital
with a creatinine kinase of 10 and troponin of 7.6.  At [**Hospital3 418**] Hospital she was noted to be in acute renal failure
with a creatinine of 1.3, up from a baseline of 0.5 and
anemic with a hematocrit of 25.  Her hematocrit was 34 one
month prior to this.  The patient was noted to have no
electrocardiograms, just her old left bundle branch block.
The patient was given Aspirin, Morphine, heparin and one
liter of normal saline for blood pressure of 70/40.  At that
time she was transferred to [**Hospital6 2018**] for consideration of cardiac catheterization.  On
arrival at [**Hospital6 256**], the patient
had an oxygen saturation of 58% on room air, although the
patient is on 2 liters of home oxygen.  Her saturation
increased to 98% on the 2 liters.  The patient's blood
pressure was borderline at 80s or 40s.  She was given 500 cc
of normal saline and given one unit of packed red blood cells
in the Emergency Room.  At that point, the patient went into
pulmonary edema secondary to her cardiac status and she was
admitted to the CCU for further care.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1.  Severe aortic stenosis, status
post balloon valvuloplasty with the valve area progressing
from 0.7 cm squared to 1.3 cm squared.  2.  Cardiac
catheterization on [**9-29**].  She had mild coronary artery
disease without obstructive lesions.  3.  Congestive heart
failure, ejection fraction of 50%, the patient has moderate
to severe aortic stenosis with 2+ aortic insufficiency.  4.
Severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease on 2 liters of
home oxygen.  5.  Anxiety.  6.  Pulmonary fibrosis.  7.
Status post cholecystectomy.  8.  Question, history of
diabetes mellitus, however, on this hospitalization the
patient's blood sugars were within normal limits.  9.  Anemia
of unknown etiology.  10. The patient was recently
hospitalized [**2152-9-30**] with congestive heart failure
requiring pressors and intubation.

MEDICATIONS ON TRANSFER:  Colace, Senna, Flovent, Singulair,
Serevent, Atrovent, Albuterol, Ativan, Effexor, Prevacid,
Coreg, Lasix and Serax.

ALLERGIES:  Penicillin, Sulfa.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Non-contributory.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient has been living in a
rehabilitation facility.  Her next of [**Doctor First Name **] is a daughter whose
name is [**Name (NI) 15359**] [**Name (NI) 54323**].

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Physical examination on admission to
the CCU revealed vital signs 97.4, heartrate 72, blood
pressure 86/39, respiratory rate 15, sating 98% on 2 liters
of nasal cannula.  In general, the patient was in mild
respiratory distress with prolonged expiratory phase.  Head,
eyes, ears, nose and throat was within normal limits.
Jugulovenous pressure was difficult to assess given the
patient's body habitus.  Cardiac:  Regular rate and rhythm,
III/VI crescendo/decrescendo murmur at the right upper
sternal border, no carotid or femoral bruits.  Chest:
Crackles at the bilateral bases.  Abdomen within normal
limits.  Extremities, no peripheral edema.  Otherwise within
normal limits.

LABORATORY DATA:  Laboratory data on admission was notable
for sodium of 132, BUN to creatinine of 60 and 1.3 which is
up from the patient's baseline of 0.5.  Troponin T of 1.53,
creatinine kinase 28.  Chest x-ray showed cardiomegaly with
bilateral pleural effusions with question of associated
atelectasis versus consolidation, left greater than right.
Electrocardiogram, normal sinus rhythm at 80, left bundle
branch block pattern, no change when compared with
electrocardiogram from [**2152-10-6**].

PLAN:  The patient was admitted to the CCU for hypotension
and troponin leak and for further management.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Ischemia - The troponin leak was felt to be
secondary to demand in the setting of hypertension and
anemia, especially given the relatively normal
catheterization one month ago.  Aspirin and Lipitor were
continued.  Coreg and ACE inhibitor were initially held
secondary to the hypotension but were restarted during the
hospital stay.

Congestive heart failure exacerbation - The patient was
diuresed approximately 500 cc per day with good effect.  The
patient remained hemodynamically stable and improved on
physical examination.  The patient was restarted on her home
regimen of Lasix 40 mg p.o. q.d. while in the hospital.  A
repeat chest x-ray should be ordered in approximately two to
four weeks to examine pleural effusion to make sure that they
are decreasing with diuresis.  If they are not, they may need
to be further evaluated with the thoracentesis.

Anemia of unclear etiology - The patient was guaiac negative.
Her MCV was 94.  Hemolysis laboratory data are negative.
The patient was initially transfused 2 units of packed red
blood cells with an appropriate hematocrit increased to 34
and has been stable since.

Acute renal failure - Creatinine 1.3 on admission, on day of
discharge it was down to 0.6 which is very close to her
baseline of 0.5.

Question of pneumonia - Seen on chest x-ray, the patient
completed a seven day course of Levaquin while in the
hospital.

History of diabetes mellitus - Glucose values were normal
throughout this hospital stay.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease - The patient's
outpatient regimen was continued without problems.  The
patient continues on 2 liters of nasal cannula which is her
home oxygen requirement.
