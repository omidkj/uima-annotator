Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1171**]
Chief Complaint:
tachycardia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
76 yo female with known aortic stenosis recently discharged
after median sternotomy for possible AVR now w/new onset a.fib.
At rehab this AM, pt was found to be tachycardic to 130's. Pt
was totally asymptomatic. She endorses mild increase in SOB from
baseline. Otherwise, denies CP, orthopnea/PND. Denies
nausea/visual changes, headache/dizzyness. Denies
dysuria/frequency, URI sx, cough. No fever/chills.
.
Pt was initially brought to [**Hospital 189**] Hospital where she had a
negative CXR and was started on an Amiodarone drip.
.
Currently, pt denies CP/palpitations, no BRBPR/melena, no
abdominal pain, nausea, no diarrhea/constipation.


History of Present Illness:
Pt is a 76 yo woman w/ h/o known AS, recently diagnosed MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 71790**]c arch calcification/aneurysm s/p recent discharge after
median sternotomy (planned AVR, but intra-op noted MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **]
aortic arch calcifications/aneurysm, so surgery aborted b/c
needs AVR, MVR, aortic arch replacement at same time which is
higher risk procedure - needed to d/w pt first), who presented
on [**2126-7-1**] with new onset atrial flutter. Pt presented from
rehab when she was found to be tachycardic to 130's. On ROS on
presentation, c/o some mild increased SOB from baseline, but
otherwise denied CP/pressure, orthopnea/PND, nausea, headache,
dizziness, orthopnea/PND, fevers/chills, any other complaints.
During hospital course, pt was treated with amiodarone gtt
initially, then changed to PO amio, put on dilt gtt, on PO beta
blocker, heparin gtt. Patient went to cath lab today for
aflutter ablation. After ablation, pt had pacemaker placed due
to sick conduction system that was noted during procedure. She
had been electively intubated for procedure given h/o sleep
apnea, obesity, and likely inability to lie flat to tolerate
procedure. Following procedure, decision was made to transfer pt
to CCU for overnight monitering.
Currently pt remains intubated, sedated.

Blood pressure was 114/59 mm Hg while seated. Pulse was 100
beats/min and regular, respiratory rate was 18 breaths/min.
Generally the patient was well developed, well nourished and
well groomed. The patient was oriented to person, place and
time. The patient's mood and affect were not inappropriate.
There was no xanthalesma and conjunctiva were pink with no
pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa. The neck was supple with
JVP of 10 cm. The carotid waveform was normal. There was no
thyromegaly. The were no chest wall deformities, scoliosis or
kyphosis. The respirations were not labored and there were no
use of accessory muscles. The lungs were clear to ascultation
bilaterally with normal breath sounds and no adventitial sounds
or rubs.
Palpation of the heart revealed the PMI to be located in the 5th
intercostal space, mid clavicular line. There were no thrills,
lifts or palpable S3 or S4. The heart sounds revealed a normal
S1 and the S2 was normal. There were 2+ systolic and 1+
diastolic murmurs, no clicks or gallops.
The abdominal aorta was not enlarged by palpation. There was no
hepatosplenomegaly or tenderness. The abdomen was soft nontender
and nondistended. The extremities had no pallor, cyanosis,
clubbing or edema. There were no abdominal, femoral or carotid
bruits. Inspection and/or palpation of skin and subcutaneous
tissue showed no stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.

.
CXR - Previous pulmonary edema and small right pleural effusion
have cleared over the past six days. Moderate cardiomegaly and
severe generalized enlargement of the thoracic aorta are
chronic. Separation of minimal calcification from the margin of
the descending aorta was shown on recent CTA not to represent
aortic dissection. There is no pneumothorax.
.
CHEST, PA AND LATERAL: There is stable moderate cardiomegaly.
The aorta is calcified and tortuous. Pulmonary vasculature is
unremarkable. There is a moderate right and small left pleural
effusion. Median sternotomy wires and surgical clips are noted.
Pacemaker is identified with right atrial and ventricular leads,
which appear in satisfactory position. No pneumothorax is
identified. Degenerative changes of the thoracic spine are
observed.
IMPRESSION: Moderate right and small left pleural effusions.
Satisfactory position of pacemaker leads.


Brief Hospital Course:
This 76-year old female with known aortic stenosis recently
discharged after median sternotomy for possible AVR presented
with new onset aflutter, receiving ablation which induced
complete heart block with subsequent pacemaker placement.
.
1. Rhythm - Patient had atrial flutter with a heart rate in the
130's on presentation and was placed on amiodorone, PO
metoprolol, diltiazem gtt, and heparin gtt.  Patient had a
catherization for ablation of the atrial flutter with
His-ventricular delay, which prompted pacer placement.  Patient
was transferred to floor with controlled heart rate and
amiodorone was discontinued (TSH normal).  Patient was initially
on heparin drip.  CT surgery spoke with patient and after
discussion with team, decision was made not to pursue surgery at
this stage.  Heparin to coumadin bridge was initiated with INR
of 2.0 to 3.0.  Patient discharged on 75mg toprol qd.
2. Pulmonary - Patient was electively intubated for procedure
[**7-3**], given elevated respirator risk with h/o OSA and inability
to lie flat with sheath post-procedure.  Patient was
successfully weaned off intubation on hospital day #2.  After
arrival to the floor, patient showed signs of fluid overload,
which prompted gentle diuresis.  On the day prior to discharge,
patient was satting well on room air and her crackles had
improved.
3. Pump - Patient has mitral and aortic valve disease,
presenting with volume overload, which prompted active diuresis
and
