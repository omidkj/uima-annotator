Speech and Swallow evaluation [**2201-9-30**]

Mr. [**Known lastname 19280**] [**Last Name (Titles) 19284**] PMV well. He was able to participate in
swallow evaluation, however he was very lethargic after being
washed up by RN this am. He continues to present with signs of
aspiration on thin liquids as evidenced by throat clearing, wet
volitional cough and sensation of a tickle in his throat. He did
appear to tolerate alternating bites and sips of nectar thick
liquids and puree. However, based on patient's increased
fatigue,
suggest he begin pleasure feeds of nectar thick liquids and
puree
in small amounts when he is awake and alert during the day.
Continue use of dobhoff as primary nutrition, hydration and
medications at this time. If patient noted with any s/sx of
aspiration (i.e. coughing, po noted in or around trach site),
please refrain from giving po. PMV must be in place for ALL POs.


This swallowing pattern correlates to a Dysphagia Outcome
Severity Scale (DOSS) rating of level 3, moderate dysphagia.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. PMV in place for ALL POs.
2. Initiate small amounts of nectar thick liquids and puree
consistencies as pleasure feeds when patient is awake and alert
and requesting throughout the day.
3. Continue use of tube feeds as primary means of nutrition,
hydration and medications.
4. Strict 1:1 supervision if patient takes pos.
5. If patient noted with coughing, desaturation, or po in or
around trach please refrain from giving pos.
6. We will continue to follow to see how he is [**Last Name (Titles) 19284**] and if
his diet may safely be advanced at a later time.
