Admission Date:  [**2151-4-12**]       Discharge Date:  [**2151-4-20**]

Date of Birth:   [**2084-6-7**]       Sex:  M

Service:  Cardiac Surgery

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 66-year-old
gentleman who developed substernal chest pain that radiated
across his chest with associated gastrointestinal upset and
diaphoresis for 48 hours prior to admission.

An electrocardiogram showed T wave inversions in the septal
leads with Q waves in V1 and V2.  The patient was transferred
to [**Hospital1 69**] for cardiac
catheterization.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Status post left pneumonectomy in [**2132**] for lung cancer.
2.  Hypertension.
3.  Repair of deviated nasal septum.
4.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

PREOPERATIVE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Diovan 160 mg by mouth once per day.
2.  Levobunolol nebulizer treatment four times per day.
3.  Combivent meter-dosed inhaler three to four times per
day.
4.  Humibid 600 mg by mouth twice per day.
5.  [**Doctor First Name **] 60 mg by mouth twice per day.
6.  Maxzide.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to [**Hospital1 1444**].

The patient was taken to the Cardiac Catheterization
Laboratory where he was found to have an ejection fraction of
approximately 30%.  Left ventricular end-diastolic pressure
was 18, and pulmonary artery pressures of 29/21.  Coronary
angiography revealed 80% to 90% distal left main, 80% ostial
left anterior descending artery, 80% ostial left circumflex,
and diffuse plaque of the right coronary artery.

Due to the patient's severe left main stenosis an
intra-aortic balloon pump was placed, and Cardiac Surgery was
consulted for operative treatment.

As the patient had received Integrilin and Plavix, and the
patient was pain free with the intra-aortic balloon pump, the
patient was taken urgently to the operating room on [**4-13**] for
a coronary artery bypass graft times four with left internal
mammary artery to the left anterior descending artery,
saphenous vein graft to the ramus and obtuse marginal, as
well as saphenous vein graft to the distal left anterior
descending artery.  Please see the Operative Note for further
details.

At the conclusion of the surgery, the patient developed some
hypokinesis of his anterior wall and required returning to
cardiopulmonary bypass with repositioning of the left
internal mammary artery graft.  The patient was successfully
from cardiopulmonary bypass and transported to the Intensive
Care Unit in stable condition on epinephrine, Levophed, and
nitroglycerin drips.

The patient remained intubated overnight.  The intra-aortic
balloon pump was removed on postoperative day one without
incident.  The patient was weaned and extubated from the
mechanical ventilation on postoperative day one.  The patient
continued on epinephrine and Levophed infusions; both of
which were weaned off on the evening on postoperative day
one.  However, the patient continued to have some moderate
hypotension.  The patient required Neo-Synephrine for
maintaining adequate systolic blood pressures.  The patient
was started on diuretic therapy.  Regarding the patient's
pneumonectomy, the patient continued to have adequate gas
exchange and responded well to pulmonary toilet.  The
patient's chest tubes were removed on postoperative day three
without incident.  The patient required packed red blood cell
transfusions to maintain a hematocrit of greater than 30.

On postoperative day four, the patient was started on
low-dose Lopressor which he tolerated well.  The patient was
transferred from the Intensive Care Unit to the regular part
of the hospital.  The patient began working with Physical
Therapy.

The patient was weaned off of oxygen; however, with
ambulation, the patient became mildly hypoxic on room air
requiring oxygen to maintain oxygen saturations in the low
90s.  The patient required some additional diuresis.  By
postoperative day seven, the patient was able to ambulate on
room air while maintaining oxygen saturations in the low to
middle 90s.

It was noted during the postoperative period that the patient
had mildly elevated blood glucose levels, requiring
sliding-scale insulin coverage to maintain a blood sugar of
less than 120.  [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] Service consultation was obtained,
and it was recommended that the patient be discharged home on
low-dose Lantus insulin with blood sugar monitoring and post
discharge followup with [**Last Name (un) **].

By postoperative day seven, the patient was cleared for
discharge to home.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON DISCHARGE:  Temperature maximum 100,
his pulse was 90 (in sinus rhythm), his blood pressure was
135/80, his respiratory rate was 16, and his oxygen
saturation was 96% on room air.  Neurologically, the patient
was alert, awake, and oriented times three; nonfocal.  Heart
was regular in rate and rhythm without rubs or murmurs.
Respiratory examination revealed breath sounds were clear on
the right without wheezes or rales.  Gastrointestinal
examination revealed the abdomen was obese, soft, nontender,
and nondistended.  The sternal incision was clean, dry, and
intact.  There was no erythema or drainage.  The sternum was
stable.  The left lower extremity Steri-Strips were intact
without erythema.  The bilateral lower extremities had 1 to
2+ pitting edema (left greater than right).  The patient's
weight on [**4-20**] was 103.5 kilograms.  The patient's weight
was 98 kilograms preoperatively.

PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON DISCHARGE:  White blood cell
count was 9.6, his hematocrit was 35.1, and his platelet
count was 292.  Sodium was 140, potassium was 3.9, chloride
was 95, bicarbonate was 34, blood urea nitrogen was 20,
creatinine was 0.9, and his blood glucose was 120.

A chest x-ray on [**4-19**] showed a small right effusion without
pneumothorax, and no infiltrate.  No evidence of congestive
heart failure.

DISCHARGE DISPOSITION:   The patient was to be discharged to
home.

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  Stable.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
 1.  Percocet 5/325-mg tablets one to two tablets by mouth
q.4-6h. as needed.
