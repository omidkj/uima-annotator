History of Present Illness:
23 year old male with no medical history who was admitted on
[**5-15**] for cellulitis.  He initially developed a "pimple" on his
left inner thigh one week prior to admit.  He popped it and it
drained a small amount of pus.  It recurred one day later and he
popped it again.  It occured the next day but larger and he felt
that it was moving into his leg.  He assumed it was a boil and
started putting warm compresses on it.  The redness, swelling
and pain slowly spread in his inner thigh, into the inguinal
region and into his left gluteal region.  He was also having
fevers at home to 101.  He presented to the ED on [**5-15**] and was
admitted for cellulits.  In the ED a CT pelvis was done which
edema and fasciitis along the left medial and posterior thigh
from the mid thigh to the inguinal and lateral perineal regions
without fluid collection or sub cutaneous gas.
.
On admit he was not having any respiratory distress although his
sat was noted to be in the low 90s on room air.  A CXR was
normal and and it was presumed secondary to atalectasis as with
deep breaths his O2 sat would increase.  He did not have an O2
requirement.
.
He was started on Vancomycin, clindamycin and unasyn for his
cellulitis.  Over the next two days his cellulitis improved and
on [**5-16**] patient felt well.  Overnight on [**5-16**] patient started
complaining of some indigestion/chest pain/cough.  He later
clarified this as more respiratory than what he though chest
pain would feel like.  He was given maalox for the "indigestion"
and started on tele.  On tele he was noted to have some runs of
NSVT without symptoms.  In the morning he was evaluated and
noted to have a new O2 requirement of 4L.  Given the concern
overnight for atypical chest pain cardiac enzymes were added on
to his am labs.  His CE enzymes were elevated trop of 1.19, CK
of 700 with an MBI of 10.3.
.
He was sent for a stat CTA to rule out PE.  CT showed no PE but
ground glass opacities in lower lobes and bronchial wall
thickening, question of aspiration pneumonitis, mild
interstitial thickening consistent with interstitial edema. ECG
at the time showed new septal St depressions and taller septal t
waves from prior and sinus tach.  His O2 requirement increased
and he was started on a NRB.  He was given nebs x1, lasix 10 iv,
and transfered to the ICU for hypoxia.

STUDIES:
[**5-15**] CT PELVIS:
Extensive subcutaneous edema and fascial thickening (fasciitis)
along the left medial and posterior thigh from the mid thigh to
the inguinal and lateral perineal regions. Edema tracks into the
medial left thigh musculature. No drainable fluid collection or
subcutaneous gas seen.
.
[**5-17**] CTA:
1. Multifocal mosaic attenuation and septal thickening are
suggestive of
pulmonary edema; a less likely consideration is viral pneumonia.

2. No pulmonary embolism.
.
TTE ([**2169-5-17**]):
The left atrium is elongated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
are normal. The left ventricular cavity is mildly dilated.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed
(LVEF= 25-30 %) with moderate to severe global hypokinesis and
relatively preserved function of the basal to mid septum and
basal lateral walls. The estimated cardiac index is normal
(>=2.5L/min/m2). Right ventricle appears normal in
size/function. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally
normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or
aortic regurgitation. No masses or vegetations are seen on the
aortic valve. The mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal.
