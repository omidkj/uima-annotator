Service:  Vascular Surgery

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Burn to posterior right calf and Achilles
area.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 69-year-old white male
with coronary artery disease, status post myocardial
infarctions, percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty,
coronary artery bypass grafting x 4, with diabetes mellitus,
hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, chronic renal
insufficiency, who had a left femoral-tibial bypass graft in
[**2128-12-12**] by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], of podiatry, did a
left Charcot foot reconstruction following bypass graft.  The
patient was readmitted to the podiatry service in [**2129-12-12**] for cellulitis of his left foot secondary to a cast.

The patient sustained a third-degree burn to the posterior
right leg after using a heating pad approximately seven to 10
days prior to admission.  The patient had fallen asleep and
was unable to feel burning of his leg.  He presented to the
[**Hospital6 204**] on [**2129-4-29**] and he was evaluated by a
vascular surgeon and a plastic surgeon.  There was debate
about patient's right leg circulation because there were no
palpable pulses, and there was a question of whether the
patient could heal the Achilles tendon area at all.  A
possible leg amputation was discussed.  The patient requested
transfer to [**Hospital1 69**] to Dr.[**Name (NI) 2870**] service for further evaluation and treatment.

ADMISSION LABORATORY DATA:  White blood cell count 14.8,
hemoglobin 11.0, hematocrit 33.3, platelet count 402,000, PT
16.6, PTT 39.2, INR 1.8, sodium 133, potassium 3.9, chloride
95, CO2 26, BUN 37, creatinine 2.5, glucose 116, ALT 76, AST
58, alkaline phosphatase 587, amylase 38, total bilirubin was
1.5, direct bilirubin 1.9, lipase 18.  Chest x-ray showed no
acute pulmonary disease.  EKG showed normal sinus rhythm at a
rate of 80.  Left atrial abnormality.  Intervention
conduction defect.  No significant change since last EKG.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the hospital
from [**Hospital6 204**] on [**2129-5-2**].  Cultures of his
right lateral foot ulcer were taken.  Normal saline
wet-to-dry dressings of his right foot were started.  His
posterior eschar secondary to burn was treated with Adaptic
and saline-moistened dressing b.i.d.  He was started on a
renal dose of levofloxacin - 250 mg p.o. q.d. and 500 mg of
Flagyl p.o. b.i.d.  Preangiogram Mucomyst protocol was
started.  Coumadin was held prior to angiogram.  IV heparin
was to be started if the INR was less than 2.

Cardiology was consulted for preoperative clearance.  An
echocardiogram was done which showed mild left ventricular
hypertrophy, basal inferior hypokinesis, and an ejection
fraction of 40%.  No further cardiac studies were necessary
and the patient was cleared for bypass graft surgery.

Vancomycin was added to levofloxacin and Flagyl.  Plastic
surgery was consulted and followed the patient during the
course of his admission.  Silvadene b.i.d. to the right
posterior leg eschar was recommended.  The podiatry service
also followed the patient and recommended saline dressing
b.i.d. to the right lateral foot pressure ulcer.  Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], the patient's endocrinologist, was consulted to manage
the patient's glucose control.

The patient complained of new onset of nausea and vomiting
during hospitalization.  The patient's liver function studies
were elevated.  An abdominal ultrasound was negative.
Hepatitis screen was negative as well.  The gastroenterology
service felt that the elevated liver function tests could be
due to levofloxacin or the patient's amiodarone.
Levofloxacin and Flagyl were stopped.  Vancomycin was
continued.  Zosyn was started at a renal dose.

The patient received Mucomyst before his arteriogram because
of his chronic renal insufficiency.  Post angiogram the
patient complained of being short of breath.  He had
decreased O2 saturations.  He was treated with IV Lasix
initially with improvement.  His chest x-ray showed
congestive heart failure.  He was started on a nitroglycerin
drip to manage his blood pressure.  He was transferred to the
vascular intermediate care unit for closer monitoring.  The
patient had received preangiography IV hydration as well as
fresh frozen plasma and his congestive heart failure was felt
to be secondary to volume overload per the cardiology
service.  Medications were adjusted to manage his blood
pressure.

The patient initially was scheduled for surgery on [**2129-5-6**]
but his renal function deteriorated.  His creatinine went up
to 3.6.  The renal service was consulted.  After evaluation
the renal service determined that the patient's deteriorating
renal function was due to contrast dye nephropathy.  The
patient's surgery was postponed.  He was diuresed with IV
