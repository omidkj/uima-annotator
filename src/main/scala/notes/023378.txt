History of Present Illness:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 14932**] is an 89 yo F w/ h/o diastolic CHF, afib s/p PPM,
h/o PNAs and bronchiectasis from [**Hospital 100**] Rehab found to have sats
80% 7/22 AM and lethargic. Pt was unable to answer lengthy
questions due to somnolence, but pt's son reports pt c/o cough,
unclear if changed in quality recently, x 1d. In ED T 103.4
rectal, SBP 130, O2 sat 92% on 100% NRB. During course in ED,
SBP decreased to 70s. She was treated with IVF without good
effect. Because her son refused a [**Name (NI) 14938**], she was started on
peripheral dopamine with an increase in SBP to 85. CXR showed
RLL PNA and U/A + 21-50 wbc. Lactate was 3.7. Per discussion w/
son in the [**Name (NI) **], pt is DNR/DNI. She was given ceftaz 2g x 1, Vanc
1g, and tylenol.
..
[**Hospital Unit Name 153**] course: She was treated initially with ceftriaxone and
vancomycin, and required dopamine for pressor support.  Blood
cultures grew Streptococcus pneumoniae, for which she was
changed to vanco/gent for possible prosthetic valve
endocarditis.  TTE [**6-29**] showed well-seated aortic and mitral
prosthetic valves without evidence of vegetation, in addition to
preserved EF 55%, 3+ TR, and severe pulmonary HTN.  Urine cx
revealed pansensitive Klebsiella. She was changed to Vanco alone
with surveillance cultures and sent to the floor [**6-29**] PM,
although still slightly labored breathing.  PICC was placed
[**6-28**].

CT chest without:
1. Multilobar pneumonia, predominantly involving the right
middle and right lower lobes with minimal involvement in the
left lower lobe.
2. Septal thickening and scattered ground-glass opacities,
likely due to superimposed hydrostatic pulmonary edema, although
hemorrhage is also possible in the setting of hemoptysis.
3. Moderate right and small left pleural effusions.
4. As the patient has had multiple recurrent pneumonias in the
left lower lobe, it would be helpful to peform CT when the
patient is not experiencing an acute infection in order to
evaluate for areas of underlying bronchiectasis.
5. Pulmonary arterial hypertension.
6. Evidence of previous granulomatous exposure.
7. Enlarged heterogeneous right thyroid gland enlargement,
previously reported as multinodular goiter on thyroid ultrasound
of [**2160-9-16**].
..
CXR:
1. Worsening right lower lobe pneumonia and increasing small
right pleural effusion.
2. Increasing patchy opacity within the left lower lobe could
represent atelectasis or infection.
..
TTE:
1.The left atrium is moderately dilated. The left atrium is
markedly dilated.
2.There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The
left
ventricular cavity size is normal. Regional left ventricular
wall motion is
normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF>55%).
3. Right ventricular chamber size is normal. Right ventricular
systolic
function is normal.
4. A bioprosthetic aortic valve prosthesis is present. The
aortic prosthesis
appears well seated, with normal leaflet/disc motion and
transvalvular
gradients. The transaortic gradient is higher than expected for
this type of
prosthesis. No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic
valve. Trace
aortic regurgitation is seen.
5. A bioprosthetic mitral valve prosthesis is present. The
mitral prosthesis
appears well seated, with normal leaflet/disc motion and
transvalvular
gradients. No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve.
6. Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
7. There is severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
8. Significant pulmonic regurgitation is seen.
9. There is no pericardial effusion.
10.There is a small pleural effusion present.

Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed)
of [**2167-1-20**]
no change. No clear evidence of endocarditis. If clinically
indicated, a
transesophageal echocardiographic examination is recommended.


Brief Hospital Course:
1.) Pneumococcal pneumonia/ bacteremia: pansensitive Strep
pneumo in BCx, clear surveillance cx, plan for 2 weeks IV PCN,
TTE negative for any signs of endocarditis, remained afebrile
with stable WBC. Will need f/u BCx when course complete to
document clearance.
..
2) R great toe pain: seen by rheumatology, felt c/w podagra,
unsuccessful attempt to tap, tx for gout, unlikely septic as pt.
afebrile, WBC stable, and BCx neg. Improved with empiric 3 days
of colcicine.

3) hemoptysis: likely due to combination of bronchiectasis and
PNA, small volume occurred on floor after leaving [**Hospital Unit Name 153**],
consulted pulm, checked CT chest which just revealed her PNA,
now resolving on coumadin holiday (as discussed with her
cardiologist
