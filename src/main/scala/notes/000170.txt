History of Present Illness:
67 yo M with history of COPD, CVA with residual left sided
weakness, history of aspiration, hypertension. Was admitted to
the MICU due to concerns for upper GI bleed, fevers, and
hypotension. Patient was at his [**Hospital3 **] facility when
discovered to have temp of 102 and was vomiting "blood and
coffee grounds". Patient reports multiple sick contacts in his
nursing home. Could not be more specific. He corraborates ED and
EMT story of coffee ground emesis; however, cannot further
elaborate. Denies current nausea or abdominal pain and denies
seeing blood in his stool.
.
Upon arrival to the ED, patient's vitals were T 100.8, BP
106/60, HR 70, RR 18, O2sat 91% RA. Received total of 2 L NS due
to blood pressures transiently to 90s systolic on several
occasions. Pressures were minimally fluid responsive and
systolics were never above 110. Had one rectal temp of 103 in
ED. Was given Vancomycin and Zosyn in ED due to question of
pneumonia. Blood cultures were sent prior to initiation of
anitbiotics. Had UA sent, which was positive by dipstick, no
culture was sent. Also received ondansetron and pantoprazole.
Stools were noted to be dark brown and guaiac positive. NG
lavage in the ED with small coffee ground specs, but otherwise
clear. Type and screen was sent, two 18G IVs were placed. GI was
made aware of the patient; however, did not officially consult
in the ED.

Imaging:
CXR [**3-6**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. Limited evaluation with suggestion of new right mid lung
opacity.
Recommend dedicated PA and lateral radiographs for further
evaluation when
clinically feasible.
2. No pneumoperitoneum.
.
CT abd/pelvis [**3-6**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. Peribronchial cuffing with airspace opacification proximally
suggests a
pneumonitis that may be infectious or secondary to aspiration.
Age-
indeterminate given lack of prior.
2. Simple cyst in the left lower renal pole.
3. Small axial hiatal hernia.
4. Atherosclerosis of the SMA origin.
5. No intra-abdominal abscess. No diverticulitis.
6. Likely dilatation of the thoracic ascending aorta for which
further
imaging is needed.
.
Radiology Report CHEST (PA & LAT) Study Date of [**2165-3-9**] 1:31 PM

Impression:
Continue improvement with almost complete resolution of right
upper lobe
opacity. Opacities in the lower lobes medially are unchanged,
likely
atelectasis. There is no pneumothorax or enlarging pleural
effusions. If
any, there is a small left pleural effusion. Moderate
degenerative changes
are in the thoracic spine.
.
[**2165-3-12**] EGD:
Impression: Medium hiatal hernia
Slightly tortuous esophagus no rings or strictures.
No lesions, no old or fresh blood in stomach
Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum
Recommendations: Follow-up with referring physician as needed
Observe in hospital setting
.


Brief Hospital Course:
Assessment and Plan
67 yo M with history of COPD, CVA with residual left sided
weakness, history of aspiration, hypertension. Was admitted to
the MICU due to concerns for upper GI bleed, fevers, and
hypotension.

# Fevers / Leukocytosis:
Pulmonary source thought initially to be most likely given that
patient had CXR opacity in RUL and new cough. Lactate at
presentation was 1.0. Patient thought to have had an aspiration
pneumonia as he already has a history of this. Legionella was
negative, levofloxacin which was initially started was then
discontinued once legionella negative. UA in the ED was positive
for bacteria, WBCs, and leuk est however UCx not sent before
antibiotics started. Patient treated with zosyn and vancomycin
for presumed UTI and PNA. Decreased to zosyn on floor. Patient
had 1x fever to 101 rectally while on floor on zosyn which
corresponded to R PIV site being red, warm, painful. After R arm
PIV pulled, he had no further fever, R arm no longer red - this
1x fever likely due to thrombophlebitis. Abx changed to PO cipro
on [**3-12**]. Foley d/c for infection risk.
.
# Hypotension:
Likely initially sepsis physiology given fever, elevated WBC.
Fluid responsive. Unlikely cardiac etiology. Patient with
unchanged EKG in the ED from baseline and no complaints of chest
pain. Cardiac enzymes were negative. Patient with several
episodes of asymptomatic hypotension at night with SBPs in high
80s which resolved w/waking patient, and were fluid responsive
(when fluids given). Patient not tachycardic during these
episodes.
.
# GI bleed:
Both coffee ground emesis and guaiac, but no grossly positive
stools point to upper GI bleed. HCT at presentation was 33.7 and
his baseline appears to be mid to upper 30s by review of medical
record. Patient with history of gastritis diagnosed on [**2160**] EGD.
Has recently been discontinued from ranitidine.  He was
restarted on protonix [**Hospital1 **] through his hospital course. Evaluated
for GI. EGD negative for gastritis, PUD. Should have outpatient
colonoscopy in future.
.
# Nutrition: As per S&S recommendations; Continue baseline diet
of nectar thick liquids and ground solids, pills crushed with
puree, swallow with chin tucked to ch
