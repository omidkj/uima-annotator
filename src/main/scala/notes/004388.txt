[**2132-11-13**] CT Chest/Abd/Pelvis : 1. Rim-enhancing fluid
collections adjacent to the descending colon concerning for
abscess. This is increased in size. In addition, there is foci
of air within some of these fluid collections as well as within
the splenectomy bed. Known colocutaneous fistula is again
identified.
2. Bilateral pleural effusions and atelectasis.
3. Emphysematous changes with loculated hydropneumothorax on the
right.
4. Small pericardial effusion and pleural effusions.
5. Small hypodensities, some of which are cysts and others are
too small to characterize or incompletely characterized.
6. Cholelithiasis.
7. Liver hypodensity, stable.
8. Infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm, stable.
9. Diverticulosis.

DVT.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Name13 (STitle) 1358**] was admitted to the Trauma ICU, pan cultured and
hydrated.  He underwent an abdominal CT which revealed a fluid
collection adjacent to the descending colon.  It was
percutaneously drained for 350 cc. and a drainage catheter was
left in place.  The fluid culture grew Bacteroides and sputum
culture grew 2 types of Pseudomonas and Stenotrophonomas.  Urine
culture was negative and blood cultures are negative to date.

The Infectious disease service was consulted for drug coverage
and they recommended a 2 week course of Meropenum, Tobramycin,
Bactrim and Fluconozole followed by reimaging.  Following
drainage of the fluid collection he had no further temperature
spikes but his WBC remained elevated at 13-17K.  He had no
abdominal tenderness.  He may need long term treatment with
antibiotics if his colocutaneous fistula persists but for the
present time percutaneous drainage and antibiotics for multi
drug resistent Pseudomonas.  His abdominal wound is clean and
granulating well with [**Hospital1 **] dressing changes.

He was transferred to the Trauma floor with stable hemodynamics,
continuation of antibiotics and daily assessment by ID.  His
pulmonary status was stable in that he maintained good O2
saturations with a 35% trach collar.  He had a very strong cough
and was able to cough his secretions up for the most part.  He
was seen by the Speech and Swallow service to try a PM valve
however he had severe coughing with slow deflation of the trach
cuff and lots of secretions.  Down sizing the trach tube was
recommended at some point prior to using a PM valve.  His tube
feeds continued via a Dobhoff feeding tube and were tolerated
well.

On [**2132-11-18**] he underwent a repeat abdominal CT for re-evaluation
of the fluid collection. The study showed that the fistula is
from the small bowel.  The drainage catheter was replaced in IR
and he subsequently had his PICC line replaced as well for IV
antibiotics.  On [**2132-11-19**] he was discharged to rehab after
receiving all three of his post splenectomy vaccines including
Pneumovax, Haemophilus and Meningococcus.
He will follow up in 2 weeks for a repeat abd CT.
