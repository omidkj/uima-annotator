History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 26438**] [**Last Name (Titles) 813**] is a 31 y.o. woman on OCPs who presents
with dyspnea, syncope and L calf pain. Her symptoms began 1.5
weeks ago with pain in the back of the L knee, which was
exacerbated with stair-climbing and alleviated with Tylenol. She
had started running and thought she had tendonitis. About 1 week
ago, she noticed that she was short of breath when she would
climb stairs or talk quickly or excitedly. The joint pain
stopped, and she began to a feel throbbing lower calf pain that
at times extended to the ankle. On the day of admission, she had
[**3-10**] consecutive syncopal episodes, falling to the ground each
time, before calling her mother, who called EMS.

.
In the ED, initial VS: BP 89/74  HR 106  RR 24  95% on NRB. Per
ED resident, A&O x 3.  Labs were drawn, which were significant
for leukocytosis of 15.3 and ARF of 1.2.  ED performed bedside
U/S that showed right sided hypokinesis.  EKG with R heart
strain.  CT head and CTA performed.  CTA showed bilateral
pulmonary embolism.  Guiaic negative in ED.  Given persistent
hypotension, patient started on alteplase in ED.
Post-thrombolysis VS improved wth BP 110-142/70-82.
.
Currently, she denies light-headness, chest pain, palpitations,
shortness of breath, or ankle edema.

PERTINENT STUDIES:
EKG [**2150-8-2**]: sinus tachycardia ~110s, nl axis, Q wave in [**Last Name (LF) 1105**], [**First Name3 (LF) **]
elevations in AVR and V1, ST depressions V4-V6
.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST [**2150-8-2**] (FINAL):
FINDINGS: There is no acute intracranial hemorrhage. There is no
mass, mass effect, edema, or infarction. Ventricles and sulci
are normal in size and configuration. There is no acute
fracture. There is moderate opacification of the maxillary
sinuses bilaterally, with some aerosolized secretions. Paranasal
sinuses and mastoid air cells are otherwise normally aerated.
Surrounding soft tissues are unremarkable.
IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial hemorrhage.
Sinus opacification as detailed above.
.
CTA [**2150-8-2**] (FINAL):
There is extensive bilateral pulmonary embolism. On the right,
the right main pulmonary artery is largely free of clot, but
there is extensive thrombus in nearly all the lobar arteries,
extending into the segmental and subsegmental branches. On the
left, the left main pulmonary artery is clear. There is thrombus
in the left lower lobar pulmonary artery which is partially
occlusive, and more extensive thrombus in segmental pulmonary
arterial branches to the left lower lobe, lingula, and left
upper lobe.

There are signs of right heart strain, with enlargement of the
right
ventricle, flattening of the interventricular septum, and slight
bowing of the  interventricular septum towards the left
ventricle.
.
TTE ECHOCARDIOGRAPHY [**2150-8-3**]
The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. Left
ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global
systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%). Transmitral and tissue
Doppler imaging suggests normal diastolic function, and a normal
left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good
leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve
appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse. The pulmonary artery systolic
pressure could not be determined. There is no pericardial
effusion.
.
BILATERAL EXTREMITY ULTRASOUND [**2150-8-4**]
Grayscale and Doppler ultrasound was performed of the bilateral
common femoral, superficial femoral, popliteal, peroneal, and
posterior tibial veins. There is a nonocclusive thrombus in the
left popliteal vein. The remainder of the veins show normal
compressibility, flow, and augmentation where applicable.
.


Brief Hospital Course:
31 y.o. F with history of abnormal pap smear with colpo in [**2148**],
on OCPs and an intermittent smoker, who presents with
hypotension, syncope x 3, found to have bilateral pulmonary
embolism.

# Pulmonary Emboli: Seen on CTA with signs of right heart
strain.  Likely originated from L calf DVT and seconday to OCP
and intermittent smoking use.  Per mother and patient, no 1st or
2nd generation family members with history of clotting or
bleeding disorders or frequent miscarriages.  Patient s/p
thrombolytic therapy with normalization of vital signs and
hemodynamically stable with significant improvement in heart
rate and oxygen requirement. The patient was continued on
heparin IV per weight based protocol bridging to coumadin.
Patient was therapeutic for 3 days and discharged on Warfarin
8mg PO Daily. She was to f/u at coumadin clinic on Monday, [**8-17**].

# Multiple hematomas: Pt had falls prior to admit with trauma to
R elbow, knee and cheek. Patient has a large R elbow hematoma
with smaller hematomas on R cheek and R knee which were
exacerbated by alteplase. Hand surgery followed and recommended
pressure dressings, ice and elevation. Patient's R arm hematoma
grew once but was otherwise stable throughout the admission with
no signs of compart
