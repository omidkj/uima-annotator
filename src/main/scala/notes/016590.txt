Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 618**]
Chief Complaint:
Left face, arm, and leg tingling, dysequilibrium, and decreased
vision on left side.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
1. Intravenous tissue plasminogen activator thromblysis
2. Transesophageal echocardiogram

History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 42 year old male with past medical history of deep
vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolus, hypercholesterolemia, and
asthma who was admitted to [**Hospital1 69**]
on [**2104-11-9**] for evaluation and management of acute stroke.

Patient was in his usual state of health until the afternoon of
admission, around 3-4pm.  While doing exercises including sit
ups and push ups, he experienced sudden onset of left hand
tingling and dysequilibrium. He felt like he was off balance and
about to fall. Shortly thereafter, he felt tingling of his lips,
gums, left hand and left foot. He also noted problems with his
vision, which he describes as decreased peripheral vision on his
left side. Additionally, he had a dull right sided headache. His
symptoms persisted and friends took him to [**Hospital3 **]. On
arrival there, he was noted to be afebrile, with BP 120/70, HR
79. On exam there, he reportedly had a left visual field cut and
ataxia. He was therefore transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further care.
He arrived at [**Hospital1 18**] at 7:45 pm. His symptoms had not changed in
the interim.

He was evaluated in the ED by the ED resident, Stroke Fellow and
attending. Examination showed left homonymous hemianopsia,
paresthesias of left face, arm and leg and left arm and leg
ataxia. NIH stroke scale score was 5. MRI showed area of
restricted diffusion in right PCA. MRA showed decreased flow in
the right PCA beyond P1. He was enrolled in the DEFUSE trial and
administered IV tPA (0.9 mg/kg) at 8:40 pm.

On review of systems, he denies fevers, chills, chest pain,
palpitations, shortness of breath, weakness, difficulty with
gait, bowel or bladder incontinence.

Past Medical History:
1. Asthma
2. Deep vein thrombosis/ Pulmonary embolus. This occurred in the
setting of leg injury and travel. He was treated with coumadin
for 6 months. Per his report, hypercoaguability work-up was
negative.
3. Hypercholesterolemia.


Social History:
Married, lives with wife in [**State 2748**]. Businessman, working in
development. Also is a naval reservist. Former pipe smoker but
quit 20 years ago. Drinks one glass of alcohol daily. Denies
drug use.


Family History:
Remarkable for brother with history of deep vein thrombosis.

-----
MRI/MRA head pre-tPA [**11-9**]: There is a large region of slowed
diffusion in the right posterior cerebral artery territory
consistent with an acute infarction. In the MRA images, there is
an abrupt cut off of the right posterior cerebral artery near
its origin. The anterior supply of the circle of [**Location (un) 431**] is
unremarkable. IMPRESSION: Acute infarction involving the right
posterior cerebral artery territory with an associated abrupt
occlusion of the right posterior cerebral artery. ADDENDUM:
There is a linear area of magnetic susceptibility in the right
posterior cerebral artery territory, possibly consistent with a
small area of hemorrhagic transformation in the acute infarction
v. unusual visibility of a vessel. Correlative plain head CT
would help to provide further differentiation.
-----
MRI/MRA post-tPA [**2104-11-9**]: Images of the brain demonstrate
cortical edema throughout the medial and posterior inferior
right temporal lobe, in the distribution of the posterior
cerebral artery territory. There are also foci of increased
signal intensity within the right thalamus. There is no further
extent of infarction, compared to the earlier exam. Otherwise,
the brain is unchanged in appearance. There is mild mass effect
associated with the infarction, but no displacement of midline
structures. The ventricles are not dilated. The basal cisternal
spaces are well visualized. There is no abnormal intracranial
susceptibility artifact to suggest the presence of hemorrhage.
In the interval since the earlier examination, there has been
slight improvement in flow signal in the right posterior
cerebral artery. More flow is identified in the proximal portion
of this vessel, though the distal portion still exhibits
diminished flow signal. Otherwise, flow signal is observed in
the left posterior cerebral artery, both vertebral arteries and
the basilar artery, as well as in the internal carotid arteries,
anterior and middle cerebral arterial branches. IMPRESSION: 1.
MRA demonstrates improved but still limited perfusion in the
right posterior cerebral artery. 2. MRI of the brain shows no
change in the extent of right posterior cerebral arterial
infarction, compared to the earlier study of this day.
-----
MRA Carotids/Vertebrals [**2104-11-10**]: The vertebral arteries, common
carotid arteries, and visualized portions of the external and
internal carotid arteries demonstrate normal flow signal without
evidence of stenosis, ulceration, dissection, or aneurysmal
dilation. No AV malformation is visualized. IMPRESSION: Normal
MRA of the carotids/vertebrals. No evide
