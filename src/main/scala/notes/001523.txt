Cardiac catheterization [**2116-8-28**]


History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 78 yr old female with PMH significant for
hyperlipidemia who presented to the outside hospital with
substernal non-radiating chest pain that began at 4:15 am [**8-29**].

Cardiac catheterization [**2116-8-29**]:
PA mean 9 mmHg; RV 30/11 mmHg; PA 30/13/19 mmHg; PCW mean 15
mmHg; LV 110/20 mmHG; aorta 110/70/19 mmHG; CO 5.0 L/min; CI 2.9
L/min/m2; SVR 160; PVR 64; [**MD Number(3) 57781**] 72%.

Right dominant; LMCA was free of obstructive disease; LAD had
mild proximal plaquing; LCx no angiographically significant
disease; RCA no disease.

Left ventriculography revealed extensive anteroapical and
inferoapical akinesis, with hyperdynamic function of the
anterior and inferior bases. The calculated ejection fraction
was depressed at 33%. No significant mitral regurgitation was
visualized.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Coronary arteries are free of angiographically-significant
CAD.
2. Moderate systolic ventricular dysfunction.
3. Mild diastolic ventricular dysfunction.
4. EKG evidence of anterolateral ST elevation with extensive
apical
akinesis and non-obstructive coronary artery disease. Possible
explanations include transient apical ballooning syndrome, MI
with
recanalized artery, focal myocarditis, coronary vasospasm.

Transthoracic echocardiogram [**2116-8-31**]:
LA is normal in size. LV wall thicknesses and cavity size are
normal. There is mild regional  left ventricular systolic
dysfunction (ejection fraction 45%). There is
hypokinesis of the entire apex/distal [**1-11**] of the left ventricle.
Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is no aortic valve
stenosis. No
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary
artery
systolic hypertension. There is a trivial/physiologic
pericardial effusion.


Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the CCU service. Differential
diagnoses for abnormal LV function in the setting of EKG changes
and normal coronary arteries included acute coronary syndrome
s/p spasm or s/p auto-lysis, eosinophilic cardiomyopathy, and
Takotsubo Apical Ballooning Syndrome. Given her history,
presentation, and clinical findings, Tokotsubo Apical Ballooning
Syndrome was thought to be most likely.

1. CAD - The patient received integrillin x 18 hours following
catheterization. Cardiac enzymes peaked CK 440 and CKMB at 25
and had been trending down. Then she was started on heparin b/o
low EF with wall motion abnormalities. After echo was obtained,
the patient was started on coumadin. She was discharged with INR
1.0, on Lovenox to bridge her to oral anticoagulation until her
INR will become therapeutic. She will continue Coumadin 5 mg po
qhs and she was given prescription for INR check to be done in 3
days. The results will be called to her primary care physician
who will manage her coumadin. Lovenox teaching was done prior to
the patient's discharge. She should remain on oral
anticoagulation for at least 2 months depending on improvement
of LV function with goal INR 2.0-3.0. The duration of her
anticoagulation therapy will be decided by her cardiologist. The
patient was also started on aspirin, low dose beta-blocker, and
ACE inhibitor that were titrated up as BP and HR tolerated.
Prior to discharge, the patient's beta-blocker and ACE inhibitor
were changed to longer acting once-a-day formulations. Her BP
was stable with SBP in 110's on the day of discharge on her
outpatient regimen.

2. Cardiomyopathy - Again, this was thought to be due to
Takotsubo Apical Ballooning Syndrome. Echocardiogram was done on
HD #3 and revealed EF 45%. TSH, iron studies, and [**Doctor First Name **] were
checked and were all within normal limits. The patient was
started on the Ace inhibitor and beta-blocker.

3. Sinusitis - the patient was continued on her outpatient
regiment of prednisone 5 mg po 3x/week. The possibility of
adrenal insufficiency was entertained in the patient presenting
with hypotension, but was felt to be unlikely with small doses
of steroids and every other day dosing.
