Service: CARDIOTHORACIC

Allergies:
Cephalosporins

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 165**]
Chief Complaint:
shortness of breath, chest discomfort

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
1. Emergency coronary artery bypass graft x1; saphenous
    vein graft to posterior descending artery.
2. Posterior descending artery thrombectomy.
3. Endoscopic harvesting of the long saphenous vein


History of Present Illness:
This 84-year-old patient with known
coronary artery disease with multiple stenting of the right
coronary artery in the past had stent restenosis and was
undergoing percutaneous intervention for this.  During this
time, there was extravasation of contrast from the right
coronary artery in the distal part with minimal pericardial
collection. Further percutaneous attempts to cover this
injured area and stop the bleeding were unsuccessful and
hence a percutaneous balloon was inserted and inflated to
temporally control the bleeding. The patient was transferred
as an emergency for exploration and possible coronary artery
grafting.

Past Medical History:
coronary artery disease(multiple percutaneous coronary
interventions to right coronary artery), hyperlipidemia,
neuropathy, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, neuropathy, chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease, left SFA stenosis w/claudication
PSH: total abdominal hysterectomy, appendectomy, tonsillectomy,

PRE-CPB:1. The left atrium is moderately dilated. No thrombus is
seen in the left atrial appendage.
2. The right atrium is moderately dilated. A patent foramen
ovale is present.
3. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. with severe global free wall
hypokinesis.
4. There are simple atheroma in the aortic root. There are
complex (>4mm) atheroma in the aortic arch. There are complex
(>4mm) atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
5. There are three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve
leaflets are mildly thickened (?#). There is no aortic valve
stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
6. Mild to moderate ([**12-24**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
7. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in person of the results.

POST-CPB: On infusion of epi, levo. AV pacing. Improved
biventricular systolic function post bypass on inotropic
support. LVEF is now 45-55%. Improved inferioseptal wall. MR is
now 1+. The RV function is now mildly depressed with 1+ TR. The
aortic contour is normal post decannulation.

Final Report
FINDINGS: Right internal jugular line tip projects over the
distal SVC.
Intact sternotomy wires are noted.
The cardiac silhouette is enlarged but unchanged from [**1-22**], [**2174**]. The mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable
and unchanged since [**2175-1-22**]. Opacifications at the base
of both sides of the chest are likely due to combination of
atelectasis and effusion, and are improved since [**2175-1-22**]. Minimal engorgement of the pulmonary vasculature is noted.

IMPRESSION:
1. Bibasilar atelectasis with associated bilateral pleural
effusion appears improved since [**2175-1-22**].
2. Minimal pulmonary vascular engorgement is noted.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was transferred from an OSH with perforation of
right coronary artery during cardiac catheterization.  She was
brought directly to the operating room where she underwent
emergent coronary artery bypass x 1 to the posterior descending
artery. She had atrial fibrillation in the operating room.
Overall the patient tolerated the procedure well and
post-operatively was transferred to the CVICU in stable
condition for recovery and invasive monitoring.
POD 1 found the patient extubated, alert and oriented and
breathing comfortably.  She was neurologically intact and
hemodynamically stable, weaned from vasopressor support.  The
patient developed rate controlled atrial fibrillation, loaded
with amiodarone then went into a junctional rhythm.   Cardiology
was consulted for assistance with rhythm management. They
recommended discontinuing the amiodarone and monitoring the
rhythm. The patient was started on Coumadin for the Atrial
fibrillation. Temporary pacing wires remained in place until
POD5, all other tubes lines and drains were removed according to
cardiac surgery protocols. The patient stayed in the ICU for
several days while her rhythm was monitored. During which she
was found to be in a stable atrial rhythm, following which low
dose beta blockers were initiated.  The patient remained
hemodynamically stable throughtout this period. She was
transferred from the ICU to the stepdown floor on POD4. The PT
and nursing staff continued to work with her for strength and
activity tolerance. She made slow progress and on POD6 she was
ready for transfer to rehabilitation at [**Hospital3 **] in
[**Location (un) **].
