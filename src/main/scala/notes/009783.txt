CT CHEST W/CONTRAST

Reason: concern for worsening broncheictasis, ?allergic
bronchopulm
Contrast: OPTIRAY

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
73 year old man with hx recuurent PNA, Common variable
immunodef, COPD,
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
concern for worsening broncheictasis, ?allergic bronchopulm
aspergillus
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.

REASON FOR EXAMINATION: Recurrent pneumonia.

COMPARISON: Serial chest radiographs from [**11-6**] to [**11-9**], [**2173**].

TECHNIQUE: MDCT of the chest after injecting of IV contrast
[**Doctor Last Name 360**] was obtained from the thoracic inlet to upper abdomen with
subsequent 1.25 and 5 mm collimation axial images reviewed in
conjunction with coronal reformats.

FINDINGS:

Extensive mediastinal lymphadenopathy is ranging up to 2 cm in
right lower paratracheal and 1.8 cm in subcarinal areas. A right
hilar lymphadenopathy is noted measuring up to 1 cm. The left
hilar lymph node is difficult to assess due to the presence of
left lower lobe atelectasis. The left lower lobe bronchus is
abruptly terminating about 1.3 cm after bifurcation. No discrete
mass is demonstrated although giving the timing of injection
endobronchial lesion cannot be excluded. The rest of the airways
are patent. Mild predominantly upper lobe emphysema is
demonstrated. Scattered areas of ground-glass opacities in the
right apex (3:14), in right upper lobe (3:21 and 28)), left
upper lobe (3:22) and right middle lobe 3:43 are demonstrated
corresponding to the parenchymal abnormalities demonstrated on
serial chest radiographs, grossly unchanged. Minimal subpleural
bilateral interstitial abnormality in the upper lungs (3:19) has
nonspecific radiological appearance.

Bilateral pleural effusion is layering and nonhemorrhagic, left
slightly more than right.

The main pulmonary artery is dilated up to 4 cm. The ascending
aorta is dilated as well measuring 4.3 cm in diameter. Coronary
calcifications are extensive involving all major coronary
arteries. The patient is after mitral valve replacement.
Pacemaker leads terminate in right ventricle and right atrium.
The overall heart size is increased with no pericardial effusion
demonstrated.

The imaged portion of the upper abdomen demonstrate hypodense
liver lesion in the left liver lobe, 2:56, 1.7 cm in diameter,
low density of up to 2 Hounsfield units most likely representing
a cyst. Small ascites surrounding the liver is noted. The
gallbladder is mildly distended up to 4 mm with no evidence of
cholecystitis. Pancreas, adrenals, upper portion of the kidneys
is demonstrated grossly unremarkable except for minimal
bilateral perinephral stranding.

There are no bone lesions suspicious for malignancy,
degenerative findings involving entire thoracic spine.

Post-sternotomy wires unremarkable with no evidence of sternal
dehiscence.

IMPRESSION:

1. Left lower lobe atelectasis most likely due to mucus
bronchial impaction. Even in the absence of identifying of the
obstructing mass it cannot be ruled out. Recommend follow-up CT
for resolution and if clinically warranted evaluation with
bronchoscopy is recommended.

2. Significant mediastinal lymphadenopathy most likely reactive
to extensive parenchymal abnormalities.

3. Multiple ground glass opacities consistent with either
aspiration or multifocal infection. No radiological features
suggesting of aspergillosis are demonstrated.

4. Extensive coronary calcifications, cardiomegaly.

5. Pulmonary hypertension and ascending aorta dilatation up to 4
cm. Status post mitral valve replacement.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)

Reason: eval for interval changes

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
73 year old man with aspiration pna/pneumonitis s/p extubation
yesterday.
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
eval for interval changes
HISTORY: Aspiration pneumonia, status post extubation, evaluate
for change.

COMPARISON: [**2173-11-7**].

FINDINGS: A single portable upright chest radiograph performed
at 1205 hours demonstrate moderate left pleural effusion,
slightly larger than that seen yesterday, with adjacent
atelectasis. There is no pneumothorax. Please note the right
costophrenic angle is not included in the study.
Mild-to-moderate cardiomegaly. Pulmonary interstitial thickening
is unchanged. Left IJV catheter terminates in the left
brachiocephalic vein and the right subclavian venous catheter
terminates in the lower SVC, unchanged. Left-sided pacemaker -
AICD with atrial and ventricular leads is unchanged.
