Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 290**]
Chief Complaint:
fever, cough, abdominal pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation

History of Present Illness:
45yo man with h/o HIV (dx'd [**2137**], off HAART since [**11-4**], last
CD4 291 in [**3-6**]), MRSA, VRE, multiple small and large bowel
infarcts s/p R hemicolectomy and partial small bowel resection,
resultant short gut syndrome with poor absorption, pancreatitis,
splenic infarcts, who p/w fever to 103F, productive cough, abd
pain. In the ED, he was found to be in abd pain requiring
morphine and then dilaudid for control (in addition to his
Fentanyl patch). He was initially not hypoxemic, but did have a
cough without significant sputum production.

His labs were notable for: leukocytosis with L shift and 4%
bands (nl SBP and lact 1.9); new thrombocytopenia; baseline
anemia with Hct 23%; baseline elevated LFTs and pancreatic
enzymes; hyponatremia and hypokalemia; PTT elevated at 40.2; UA
with many bacteria. He had a room air ABG that was 7.42/42/89,
but subsequently was found to be hypoxemic to 85% on RA, up to
100% on 4LNC. Repeat CXR was performed, which showed development
of RML or RLL infiltrate. He received broad-spectrum abx
coverage, given his h/o MRSA and VRE, with meropenem, linezolid,
bactrim. He did not receive steroids for PCP.

diffusely mildly TTP, no r/g

Pertinent Results:
CXR [**2151-5-20**]
Left subclavian catheter terminates in the junction of the
superior vena cava and right atrium. The heart size is normal.
Diffuse interstitial opacities have developed with perihilar
haziness and bilateral peripheral septal thickening. This is
most likely due to edema from mild fluid overload, but atypical
infection is also possible in the appropriate clinical setting.

CT ABD [**2151-5-21**]
1. Patient is status post right hemicolectomy and resection of a
significant portion of small bowel. There is again seen
abnormally thickened loops of distal jejunum at the ostomy site;
however, this is unchanged in appearance from [**2151-3-15**]. No
intraabdominal abscess is identified.
2. Patient is status post stenting of the proximal SMA. There is
a filling defect identified in the proximal SMA after the stent;
however, there is distal reconstitution of the vessel.
3. Stable appearance of low density areas within the spleen,
representing known infarcts.
4. Stable areas of low density within the pancreas, which is
inseparable from the duct may represent pseudocyst or IPMT,
which is unchanged.
5. Mild bibasilar atelectasis and tiny right pleural effusion.

ECHO [**2151-5-25**]
Minimally thickened mitral leaflets with mild mitral
regurgitation. No discrete vegetation identified.

CT CHEST [**2151-5-28**]
1. Multiple nodules throughout both lungs, some of which have
ground-glass density. This is most concerning for atypical
infection such as fungal infection.
2. Large bilateral pleural effusions with compressive
atelectasis of the lower lobes.

CXR [**2151-5-31**]
IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**2151-5-28**] through [**2151-5-30**]:
Pulmonary vascular congestion and moderate right pleural
effusion have both increased slightly since [**2151-5-30**].
Cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal. Opacification at the
lung bases medially has been present on the left since [**6-27**],
but is more pronounced on the right. Changes are consistent with
atelectasis, but pneumonia, particularly aspiration, cannot be
excluded. No pneumothorax
