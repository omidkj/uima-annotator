Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1436**]
Chief Complaint:
shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none


History of Present Illness:
82M hx severe dementia, DM, CHF, PVD (stent x2, most recent
[**5-/2101**]), reported recent NSTEMI on [**2-10**], recent admission from
[**Date range (1) 4177**] for a fib with RVR and acute CHF exacerbation who p/w
shortness of breath. Today, the patient was noted to have
increased work of breathing starting around noon time with O2
sats in the 70s-80s. He was started on supplemental oxygen and
given lasix 40mg IV x2, 80mg x2 with metolazone 5mg x2, however
did not urinate well to these boluses, only putting out ~450cc
over a 12 hour period. He continued to have shortness of breath
and was started on Bipap, then sent to the ED for further
evaluation. Of note, he has received 3 PRBC transfusions over
the past week, most recently 2 on Wednesday - It is unclear what
the reason for these transfusions is. Per report, he was
receiving heparin SC until at least Wednesday.
.
In the ED, initial vitals were not recorded. He was continued on
Bipap, had a CXR which was essentially unchanged from previous,
EKG without ischemic changes. Labs showed elevated Cr to 2.0,
Hct up to 31, Trop of 0.08, and BNP of 23,000. Blood cultures x2
were also drawn, a UA showed mod. leuks and few whites/bacteria.
Vitals on transfer were: 74 110/58 20 BiPap 10/5 100% --> O2 Sat
100%.
.
On the floor the patient is unable to answer questions or follow
commands secondary to severe dementia.
.
ROS unable to be obtained [**3-16**] severe dementia.

Pertinent Results:
- ECG: Sinus rhythm at 73 with PVCs. No acute ischemia.
.
- ECHO [**2102-2-24**]: The left atrium is elongated. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. There is mild
(non-obstructive) focal hypertrophy of the basal septum. The
left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF 70%). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic root is
mildly dilated at the sinus level. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Mild
(1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. The mitral valve leaflets are myxomatous.
There is mild posterior leaflet mitral valve prolapse. Moderate
to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate [2+] tricuspid
regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed)
of [**2101-9-7**], the mitral and tricuspid regurgitation are
increased.
.
CXR: FINDINGS: There is mild cardiomegaly. The aorta is tortuous
and calcified. The mediastinal and hilar contours appear
unchanged. There is a similar mild interstitial abnormality with
prominence of central pulmonary vascularity, suggesting mild
vascular congestion. In addition, patchy streaky opacities in
the right mid and lower lung suggest a background of minor
scarring or atelectasis. Although evaluation is limited, there
is no definite pleural effusion. No pneumothorax is
demonstrated, although it is noted that the left
lung apex is obscured by a flexed chin.

IMPRESSION: Essentially stable findings suggesting mild
pulmonary vascular congestion.

Brief Hospital Course:
82M hx severe dementia, DM, CHF, PVD, recent NSTEMI, AF/RVR and
CHF admitted with CHF exacerbation.
.
# ACUTE ON CHRONIC DIASTOLIC CHF- Patient appeared mildly
clinically volume overloaded on admission, with crackles, mildly
elevated JVP (although does have TR), mild hip edema. CXR showed
mild pulmonary congestion, and BNP elevated supporting
congestive etiology. Also considered aspiration pneumonitis
(although no new x-ray findings), PE (although was on heparin
until Wednesday per report, not tachycardic, and responded to
BiPAP), and ACS (although negative EKG and enzymes). Etiology of
CHF exacerbation unclear given no e/o infection, ACS,
tachycardia, HTN, diet/med noncompliance. Patient required BiPAP
in ED, which was successfully discontinued 20 minutes after
arrival in CCU. Called out of CCU once weaned off BiPAP. Patient
initially started on Lasix gtt and metolazone, then switched to
IV Lasix. His home meds (isosorbide, hydralazine) were continued
for afterload reduction given MR. [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **], he was started
on Torsemide 20mg PO daily. [**Last Name (Titles) **] weight 88 kg.
.
# CAD: stable and without signs of ACS on EKG/enzymes. Patient
is not on Plavix, it seems that this is [**3-16**] GI bleeds in the
past. Continued home ASA and metoprolol.
.
# DM: continued glargine and sliding scale per [**Hospital 100**] Rehab
recs.
.
# Severe dementia: aspiration and fall precautions. Continued
home sertraline.
