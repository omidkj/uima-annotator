Allergies:
Penicillins / Levofloxacin

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 99**]
Chief Complaint:
shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:

History obtained from son and from [**Name (NI) **] notes and signout as pt.
somnolent and on BIPAP on arrival to ICU. In brief, Mr. [**Known lastname 5749**] is
an 89 year old [**Hospital 100**] Rehab resident with history of coronary
artery disease, congestive heart failure, OSA, multiple previous
pneumonias/bronchitis presents with 1 day of shortness of breath
and non-productive cough at [**Hospital 100**] rehab, and started on
ciprofloxacin (per ED resident) 1d prior to admission. This AM,
he became increasingly tachypneic and hypoxic to 80s on baseline
oxygen, given abx. and lasix 40mg IM.
Recent admission in may with similar presentation, given abx.,
nebs, lasix, and improved without need for intubation or NIPPV.
Per son, also recently treated for PNA 1 month ago. Today, also
became more lethargic, so decision made to send patient to [**Hospital1 18**]
ER. At baseline, most vigorous activity involves transfers to
powerized wheelchair, but is cognitively clear.
.
In [**Name (NI) **], pt. 99.6, HR 93, 128/68, 35 91% on NRB, somnolent on NRB
with initial gas of 7.23/106/133/47 on NRB. Repeat gas
7.30/90/62/46 on 30%FiO2 on BIPAP. CXR showed increased
inflitrates bilaterally, so given 1 dose of vancomycin. Given
poor gas, ED had discussion of possible temporary intubation
(pt. has signed DNR/DNI) with pt. who refused, but was thought
to be too somnolent to have capacity.
.
I spoke with son and both of his most recent PCPs Drs. [**Last Name (STitle) 14936**]
and [**Name5 (PTitle) **] about his code status, and pt. was clear that he did
not want prolonged or permanent time on ventilator but had not
had discussion re: temporary intubation for reversible causes,
and both PCPs felt that it was appropriate for that decision to
be made by his son who was HCP. When I spoke to his son, he
reiterated above, but agreed that a trial intubation would be
what his father would want.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2168-11-13**] 12:27 PM
IMPRESSION: Persistent, patchy, right-sided multifocal airspace
process unchanged in appearance compared to [**2168-5-24**] and [**2165-8-23**]
probably related to chronic findings secondary to
bronchiectasis. Question new left perihilar opacities. Probable
small pleural effusions. Clinically correlate.
.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2168-11-17**] 10:45 AM
FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**11-16**], there is little
change. Again, there are bilateral lower lobe and right middle
lobe opacifications consistent with pneumonia. Pacemaker device
remains in place.

Brief Hospital Course:
He was admitted to the MICU [**Location (un) **] team, where he was treated on
BiPAP with good success, along with vancomycin and cefepime from
presumed nosocomial pneumonia.
.
He was transferred to the floor on evening of [**2168-11-16**], but was
noted to be hypoxic with oxygen saturation of 85% on 4L.  He had
been stable overnight while on BiPAP, however he had increased
respiratory rate and was hypoxic on 50% face [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] he
transferred back to MICU due to need for more frequent BiPAP and
for closer monitoring.
.
# Hypercarbic respiratory distress/PNA: As previously related,
at baseline patient requires 2 L NC O2 prn and is unable to do
most physical activity, including walking. He presented with
with worsening chronic respiratory acidosis with likely
additional metabolic alkalosis, this was felt to be secondary to
a nosocomial pneumonia in conjunction with his baseline lung
disease and sleep apnea. He continues to have stable blood
gases, however was noted to be more somnolent.  The
differential, as previously discussed, included PNA, CHF
exacerbation, bronchiectasis/bronchomalacia causing worsening
ventillation.  Admission CXR showed question new left perihilar
opacities and probable small pleural effusions.  WBC 6.1 on
admission.  Blood cx on admission with NGTD x2.
Vancomycin/cefepime (7 days total) to cover nosocomial,
post-obstructive PNA, and possible aspiration PNA as well, given
allergy to penicillins and levofloxacin. Has tolerated
cephalosporins well in past. Antibiotics were started on [**11-13**],
so will complete course on [**11-19**].  Patient was put on BIPAP at
night and as needed during day for somnolence, FaceT and Venturi
otherwise.  He received Chest PT and incentive spirometry as
