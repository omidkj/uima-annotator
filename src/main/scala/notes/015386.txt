Chief Complaint:
adnexal mass

History of Present Illness:
This is a 54-year-old gravida 0 woman who presented recently to
our emergency room with complaints of worsening right lower
quadrant pain.  On detailed questioning, she reports that this
pain has been gradually getting worse over time, perhaps for
over a year now.  She reports that while getting up out of bed
recently she felt a sharp stabbing pain in the right lower
quadrant that essentially left her immobilized.  She was unable
to sit up.  In the emergency room, a full evaluation was
performed.  This included a CT scan, which revealed a complex
solid, cystic adnexal mass measuring 21.8 x 17 x 21.7 cm.  This
mass appears to emanate from the right adnexal region.  However,
a pedunculated fibroid or even leiomyosarcoma could not be
excluded as a potential etiology.  A CA-125 level of 44 was
obtained and a CEA level of 2.1 was noted.  [**Known firstname 6744**] has a number
of medical problems, but she reports she is overall fairly
stable at this point.  [**Known firstname 6744**] denies manifestations of advanced
ovarian cancer.  She denies any shortness of breath, difficulty
with gastrointestinal functioning, abdominal bloating.  She has
no family history for ovarian cancer and no history of adnexal
masses.  She denies recent fever, and there is no indication
that this growth is of the appendix or intestinal in origin.

Past Medical History:
Diabetes Mellitus, Type II
Hypertension
Asthma
OSA
Obesity
Migraine headaches
Lower extremity cellulitis
GERD
Arthritis

Social History:
She denies tobacco, drug, or alcohol use.  She works at
[**Hospital3 1810**].

Family History:
Mother with h/o of DM.  Father with h/o HTN and CAD, died at age
53.  She also has a niece with MS.  She reports her mother
developed lung cancer and had extensive cancer and progression
of the disease as reason for her death.  She recently died only
within the past year ago.  She has no other family history of
cancer and has no family history of thromboembolic disorder.

Physical Exam:
At the time of preoperative visit:

She appears in no apparent distress.  She is morbidly obese.
HEENT:  Normocephalic, atraumatic.  Oral mucosa without evidence
of thrush or mucositis.  Eyes, sclerae are anicteric.
Neck:  Supple, there is no mass.
Lymph node survey, negative cervical, supraclavicular, axillary,
or inguinal adenopathy.
Chest:  Lungs clear.
Heart:  Regular rate and rhythm.
Back:  No spinal or CVA tenderness.
Abdomen:  Soft. Pannus is quite pendulous, and around the
umbilicus and inferiorly, there is a woody edema identified.
There is no palpable mass; however, given her morbid obesity, it
is extremely difficult to feel anything beyond the pannus.
Extremities: There is no calf tenderness to palpation.
Pelvic reveals normal external genitalia.  Inner labia minora
are normal.  The urethral meatus is normal.  Speculum was
placed, normal cervix is seen. Pap smear is obtained.  Bimanual
exam is limited due to her obesity.  I am unable to appreciate
the adnexal mass, although I know there is a fullness on the
right side.  I do not appreciate any nodularity in the posterior
cul-de-sac.  I do not appreciate a mass on the left side.  There
is no parametrial nodularity.

[**2154-11-10**]:
IMPRESSION
1. No evidence of intraperitoneal or retroperitoneal hematoma.
2. Dilated loops of small bowel proximally, may relate to
post-surgical
ileus. However, an early small-bowel obstruction cannot be
excluded.
3. Small amount of nonspecific fluid and stranding seen within
mid abdomen
and pelvis, likely post-surgical.

[**2154-11-12**]: CXR
1. Nasogastric tube tip not well seen, may be only as far as the
distal
esophagus. Repositioning is recommended.
2. Dilated loops of small bowel, likely secondary to
postoperative ileus.
3. Mild pulmonary vascular congestion. Cardiomegaly

[**2154-11-16**]: Lower extremity veins, Left
 No color flow or compressibility of the left popliteal vein
concerning for possible DVT. Minimal Doppler waveforms obtained
in the left
popliteal vein may represent sluggish or slow flow.

[**2154-12-1**]: CXR
Left PICC tip is difficult to evaluate. It can be seen only to
the mid SVC.
There is moderate cardiomegaly. The central pulmonary arteries
are enlarged.
There is no CHF, pneumonia, pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
Right jugular
vein catheter tip is in the lower SVC.

[**2154-11-26**] Upper extremity veins
No evidence of DVT
