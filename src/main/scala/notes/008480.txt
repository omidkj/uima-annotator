Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 106**]
Chief Complaint:
CP

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
68 y.o. F with h/o obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy,
reactive airways disease, severe anxiety with panic attacks
presents with CP since 2 pm to OSH after 2 hours of symptoms
(16:40). Patient was found to be hypotensive with complete heart
block, intermittent RBBB and LBBB and was transfered to [**Hospital1 18**]
for further (cardiac?) intervention due to presumed amiodarone
toxicity. Patient at baseline, has had a worsening functional
status. She moved to an [**Hospital3 **] 4 years ago and has had
a marked increase in her anxiety level along with new
aggoraphobia. Patient started seeing recently a social worker
and was scheduled to see a psychiatrist. Patient also often gets
short of breath and has been evaluated by pulmonologist @ NEBH
for unspecified reactive airway disease unresponsive to
steroids. Patient in addition to her prolonged nausea and
shortness of breath, had a sudden onset of mid sternal CP [**11-17**]
radiating to the back and her neck. She had associated
lightheadedness, palpitations, nausea including vomiting and
diaphoresis. Her pain last 2 hours and was relieved in ambulance
(? with what) but recurred upon arrival to [**Hospital1 18**] and is
persisting @ [**3-20**].
In [**Hospital3 **] ED, patient was found to be hypotensive and
bradycardic to 30s. She received dopamine, glucagon, and
calcium. After initial failed attempt a RIJ swan was inserted
along with a temporary ventricular pacing wire. The swan
readings showed elevated biventricular pressures. Patient was
also started on dopamine for hypotension and her hypoxia
improved with NRB. Patient was transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] for further
care.
.
ROS:
Upon arrival patient denies any fevers/chills, has very poor PO
intake for several months, reports a decreasing weight (18
lbs/last 6 weeks), patient reports months long nausea however
with vomiting [**5-27**] afternoon. Patient denies any cough, x 1
hemoptysis in ED that resolved. No abdominal pain. Report
urinary hesitancy, no dysuria, no hematuria. Chronic
constipation on metamucil. No myalgias/arthralgias.

Pertinent Results:
PRIOR STUDIES:
[**2197-9-21**] Cath:
CONCLUSIONS:
1. There is angiographic evidence of hypertrophic
cardiomyopathy. Neither abasal nor inducible intraventicular
gradient was documented on the patient's current medical
therapy.
2. The patient's global left ventricular ejection fraction is
64% with a basal cardiac index of 2.7 liters per meter per meter
squared. Baseline LVEDP is 32 mmHg with a mean pulmonary
capillary wedge pressure of 28 mmHg.
3. Mild mitral valve regurgitation is angiographically
documented.
4. There is no obstructive coronary artery disease.
5. Moderate pulmonary arterial systolic hypertension is
hemodynamically documented. PA pressure is 48/22 with a mean
right atrial pressure of 15.

.
CXR:
1. Cardiomegaly with mild congestive heart failure.
2. Satisfactory position of Swan-Ganz catheter. Unclear position
of the most probably right internal jugular line.
3. Right pleural effusion.

INTERPRETATION:
.
Findings:
.
LEFT ATRIUM: Moderate LA enlargement.
RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Mildly dilated RA. A catheter
or pacing wire is seen in the RA and extending into the RV.
LEFT VENTRICLE: Moderate symmetric LVH. Normal LV cavity size.
Normal regional LV systolic function. Hyperdynamic LVEF. Mild
resting LVOT gradient.
RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.
AORTA: Normal aortic root diameter.
AORTIC VALVE: Normal aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS. No AR.
MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. Mild (1+)
MR.
TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets with trivial

.
Conclusions:
1. The left atrium is moderately dilated.
2. There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The
left
ventricular cavity size is normal. Regional left ventricular
wall motion is normal. Left ventricular systolic function is
hyperdynamic (EF>75%). There is a mild resting left ventricular
outflow tract obstruction, which may be due in part to the
hyperdynamic state of the LV.
3. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+)
mitral
regurgitation is seen.
