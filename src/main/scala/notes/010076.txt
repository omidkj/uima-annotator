Blood Culture [**2118-2-15**]: pending
Urine Culture [**2118-2-15**]: pending

IMAGING:
CXR:
Low lung volumes result in bronchovascular crowding and
accentuate the cardiac silhouette. Streaky retrocardiac and
right perihilar
densities are likely atelectasis. The cardiac and mediastinal
contours are
normal.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname **] is a 26 year old man with a past medical
history significant for asthma and substance abuse who presented
with altered mental status consistent with
intoxication/overdose. He was admitted to the MICU, given
intravenous fluids and monitored overnight. He was clearly
intoxicated likely with multiple substances- urine tox positive
for benzodiazepines, barbituates and opiates. Serum tox screen
negative. Patient admitted to taking 10 of his prescribed
neurontin and denied any other ingestions. He was initially
somnolent though able to protect his airway without intubation.
Mental status cleared fully overnight and he was alert and
oriented to person, place and time in the morning. Patient
insisted on leaving AMA as he had a hearing with dept of social
services to determine custody of his daughter. The team
explained risks of leaving including life threatening worsening
of his medical problems, in particular we explained that we were
concerned about his overdose, the fact that his liver enzymes
were elevated, and findings on his CXR were concerning for an
evolving pneumonia. Patient demonstrated understanding of these
risks and was able to communicate that the risk of leaving the
hospital included life threatening worsening of these
conditions. Patient also denied any suicidal or homicidal
ideation and denied that his overdose was an attempt to harm
himself. He was given an Rx for levofloxacin 750mg for 5 days
prior to leaving given concern for evolving PNA. He was also
encouraged to make an immediate appointment with his PCP.
