repolarization changes. overall similar to previous tracing
[**7-/2169**]

[**2169-10-11**] CXR - new infiltrate within the lingular lobe which

pneumothorax, or pulmonary vascular congestion is detected

[**2169-10-17**] CXR, PA & Lat - heart size is enlarged. slight
interval worsening in bilateral perihilar and lower lobe
opacities is consistent with pulmonary edema. Bilateral pleural
effusion, left more than right, is present.

associated atelectasis/collapse & consolidation bilaterally c/w
pneumonia. No empyema, no abscess

effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 78736**] was evaluated in the ED and found to be in severe
shock from presumed pulmonary infection.  A Central Venous Line
was placed in the ED and antibiotic therapy and fluid
resucitation were begun immediately.  The patient was admitted
to the Medical Intensive Care unit where his hypotension and
hypernatremia were treated with vigourous IV fluid rehydration
without the use of pressors.  His Pneumonia continued to be
treated with broad spectrum antibiotics with Levofloxacin and
Vancomysin.  An NG tube was placed to provide continued
nutrition during this acute recovery phase of his illness.

Once he began showing signs of clinical improvement and
stability, the patient was transferred to the floor for
continued care.  Over the following days his renal fxn improved
to better than baseline, his white count and left shift began
resolving, his mental status started to clear, and he became
afebrile.

At the time of transfer to [**Hospital 100**] Rehab MACU, the patient was
still in guarded but stable condition.  He is not yet
ambulating, not yet tolerating a PO diet, and still experiencing
episodic delerium.  The patient is also still has an oxygen
requirement and is undergoing gentle diuresis to improve the
pulmonary edema and pleural effusions that developed secondary
to his vigourous hydration in the MACU.

Mr. [**Known lastname 12367**] has also been constipated is on a bowel regimen to
help him move his stools.  A Spigelian (abdominal wall) hernia
found on CT abdomen could also be explaining his episodic
abdominal pain.  He was seen and evaluated by the general
Surgery team who felt this could be handled later once the
patient's general functional status was more improved.  Contact
information for follow-up is given in the discharge follow-up
instructions.

The plan at the time of discharge is to continue antibiotic
therapy and gentle diuresis at [**Hospital 100**] Rehab with slow advances
in diet and activity as tolerated.  Once the patient has
improved, arrangements should also be made to see his PCP and
the surgical specialists.
