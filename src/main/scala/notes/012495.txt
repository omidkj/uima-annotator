Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 99**]
Chief Complaint:
respiratory distress

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
OR for staged repair, [**3-15**] R femur retrograde rod and L IM rod
removal, 3/24 L IT fx repair

History of Present Illness:
85F w/ htn, demential, osteoporosis, frequent falls, now pod [**2-25**]
s/p staged repair of femoral and intra-chonteric fx now
transferred to micu from ortho for evaluation of resp distress.

Records somewhat limited but extubated [**3-17**] after peri-operative
course c/b hypotension, oliguria requiring neosynephrine.
Transferred to floor when noted to be occasionaly tachycardic,
tachypneic and agiatated. Being treated for UTI. Geriatrics
consult called for evaluation of delirium and noted to be
increasingly tachycardic, hypoxic so undewent chest ct/cta which
did show LUL PE and evidence of diffuse patch bilateral ground
glass opacity c/w pna and bilateral lobe collapse. INitial ABG
7.44/32/50 and by time medical floor team evaluated, pt
tachypneic to 40's, satting in mid 90's on shovel mask. Given
elevated JVP, crackle on exam, initially bipap to icu and
diuresed nearly 2 liters with some improvement to resp status.
However, several hourse into micu course, became increasingly
tachycardic and tachypenic and ultimately intbuated for clinical
demise. Post intubation, pt hypotensive to 60's and marginal
urine output requring pressors and central venous access which
revealed cvp 1.

Pertinent Results:
RADIOLOGY [**2108-3-20**]:
=================
CT OF THE CHEST WITH AND WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: Filling defect is
seen within a left upper lobe pulmonary artery, best seen on
series 3, image 126, concerning for pulmonary embolism. Diffuse
multifocal patchy ground-glass opacities are seen within the
lungs bilaterally consistent with infectious process. There is
evidence of bilateral lower lobe collapse and pleural effusions.
Limited views of the upper abdomen are unremarkable.
Degenerative changes are seen throughout the spine and within
the shoulders.
.
IMPRESSION:
1. Left upper lobe pulmonary embolism.
2. Diffuse patchy ground-glass opacities seen within the lungs
bilaterally consistent with pneumonia.
3. Bilateral lower lobe collapse and pleural effusions.
.
ECHO [**3-20**]:
===========
Conclusions:
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses and
cavity size are normal. There is moderate regional left
ventricular systolic dysfunction with severe hypokinesis of the
inferior wall, mid inferolateral wall, and distal half of the
septum. The right ventricular cavity is moderately dilated with
focal hypokinesis of the apical half of the free wall. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good
leaflet excursion. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral
regurgitation. There is no mitral valve prolapse. There is mild
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
effusion.

IMPRESSION: Right ventricular cavity enlargement with free wall
hypokinesis. Regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction c/w
CAD. Pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.


Brief Hospital Course:
Respiratory Failure: Patient was transferred to the ICU on
[**2108-3-19**] for hypoxic respiratory failure. Of note, pt had been
just transferred to Medicine from the Orthopaedic service. At
time of initial evaluation, noted to be tachypneic to 40's and
satting in low 90's on non-rebreather. Chest CTA earlier in the
day had demonstrated left segmental pe, multi-lobar PNA, and
evidence of CHF. While patient initially responded to CPAP and
diuresis, her tachypnea persisted and given hypoxia, intubated
on the evening of [**3-19**]. Of note, abg consistently showed
evidence of respiratory alkolosis. As alluded to above, the
etiology of respiratory failure thought to be multifactorial
from PE, CHF and PNA. Managment of PE was complicated however by
bleeding into her L gluteal surgical site s/p PBRC transfusions.
Broad spectrum abx (Ceftaz/Vanco/Flagyl) which was switched to
only vancomycin for MRSA in sputum [**6-29**] day course [**Date range (1) 62187**].
 Then placed on Vanco/Zosyn for possible LLL PNA, started
[**2108-3-28**]. Pt was diruesed aiming for negative 1L/day - limited by
hypotension.  Was PS 5/5 and then after family meeting the
decision was made to extubate her with no intubation.  Since she
did not do well after extubation and interval bipap- family made
her CMO. She was pronounced dead on [**2108-3-30**] secondary to
respiratory failure.

Hypotension: Pt initially tachycardic and mildly hypertensive
upon presentation to MICU. As mentioned above, diuresed as part
of therapy for CHF. Upon intubation, pt noted to become
hypertensive requiring aggressive IVF and Levophed for pressor
support. Initially CVP was 1 suggesting that patient had perhaps
been diursed too quickly for her to equilibrate. This may have
been compounded by sedatives and pna. She was resusciated with
several liters of fluid and by late [**3-20**], has not required
further pressor support. As mentioned above, she does have
evidence of PNA being treated with abx. [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 104**] stim did not
reveal evidence of adrenal insuffiency. She was tolerating
diuresis and beta-blocker.  She transiently required pressors,
but the week b/f death had normal BP without pressor support.

CHF: Pt did have echo showing ef 30-35 with regional wall
motions. She has no echo for prior comparison although pt did
have positive enzymes during her MICU presentation. As mentioned
above, CHF was thought to be part contributor to her respiratory
failure, and as such, has been diuresed with iv lasix. She was
also started on low dose beta-blocker did not tolerate an ACEI
secondary to hypotension.

NSTEMI: As mentioned above, pt did have positive troponins upon
her presentation to the MICU. It was not clear if cardiomyopathy
is the direct result of her MI. She was managed with Aspirin,
statin, and low dose beta-blocker for her tachycardia.

Anemia: As alluded to above, pt had required several units of
blood. The etiology of her transfusion dependence was thought to
be related to bleeding within her left gluteal surgical site. In
fact, an abominal ct on [**3-24**] demonstrated large hematoma in left
gluteal region that was believed to be associated with left
femoral fracture. Her HCT stabilized even after heparin
restarted.

Pulmonary Embolism: Found with left upper lobe on PE on chest
CTA [**3-19**]. It was thought that this PE may be one contributor to
respiratory failure. She was managed with iv heparin.

Left femoral neck/Right trochanteric fracture: History of
multiple falls and fractures secondary to osteoporosis and pt
was initially transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] from OSH on [**3-15**] after noted
to have right trochanteric fracture. Her case had been
complicated by the discovery of bilateral fractures that was
treated with staged surgery.
