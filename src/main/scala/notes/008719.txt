Attending:[**Doctor First Name 3298**]
Chief Complaint:
pain crisis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
right internal jugular central venous catheter placement


History of Present Illness:
46 yo F with sickle cell anemia, multiple admission for pain
crises who presented with an acute onset bilateral knee,
shoulder, hip, and chest pain, consistent with prior pain
crises.

The patient experienced the acute onset of knee pain the morning
of her admission, while brushing her teeth, about 20 minutes
after getting up. This was followed by chest, shouler, and hip
pain bilaterally. Given the severe pain, the patient presented
to the emergency room.

In the ED, initial vital signs were 98.2 95 133/81 20 100%
4L/NC. The patient was given normal saline 1 liter and dilaudid
1 mg IV x 3.

There was concern that she was developing acute chest and she
was admitted to the MICU. She complained of significant pain
when she arrived the the ICU.

Past Medical History:
1) Sickle Cell Disease- Hgb SS: diagnosed at age 3 with
complications including avascular necrosis of R hip, acute chest
syndrome, and pulmonary infarction. Spleen autoinfarction.
-Pneumococcal vaccine [**2126**]
-Influenza vaccine [**2126**]
-H Flu & Meningococcal vaccine [**1-/2114**]
2) Hepatitis C- Genotype 1B. Dx in [**2106**]'s, believed to be due to
frequent transfusions. Liver biopsy [**3-24**], stage III fibrosis. In
[**2120**], was on peg interferon & ribavarin, but d/c'd due to
neutropenia.
3) S/P cholecystectomy for gallstones in [**2096**]'s
4) S/P appendectomy in [**2096**]'s
5. Proteinurea- Started lisinopril 2.5 mg 1 po daily [**4-/2127**]

Social History:
Married, works as executive assistant for housing development.
Social smoking in high school, none currently. Rare ETOH use,
only on holidays. Denies drug use.

Family History:
Multiple family members on mother's side of family with sickle
cell disease.

Micro Labs
Urine Culture [**3-10**]:
10,000-100,000 ORGANISMS/ML..
         Alpha hemolytic colonies consistent with alpha
streptococcus or
         Lactobacillus sp.

Urine [**3-15**]: No growth
Blood Culture [**3-10**], [**3-11**], [**3-13**], [**3-14**]: No Growth Final

Throat Strep [**3-11**]: Negative

CXR [**3-10**]:
1. Since the recen radiograph one day prior, there has been
development of
new bilateral diffuse pulmonary infiltrates, likely pulmonary
edema, however infection and infarction cannot be excluded.
2. Development of marked cardiomegaly and findings consistent
with heart
failure.
3. Multiple loops of distended large bowel incompletely imaged
on this
radiograph.

CXR [**3-12**]:
A right IJ central line is present, tip over right atrium,
relatively low.  Clinical correlation regarding possible
retraction is requested.  There are low inspiratory volumes.
There is probable enlargement of the cardiomediastinal
silhouette, even allowing for this. There are diffuse patchy
opacities throughout both lungs, increased retrocardiac density
consistent with left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation,
and equivocal small effusions.  Again seen is diffuse increased
density of the bones, likely related to the patient's sickle
cell. Increased density at the right humeral head could be due
to osteonecrosis.Compared with [**2129-3-11**] at 2:04 a.m. and allowing
for technical differences, no definite interval change.

Tib/Fib X-Ray [**3-14**]:
FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**2129-1-29**], there is
little overall
change. Again there are areas of sclerosis involving the distal
femur,
proximal and much of the shaft of the tibia, and the talar dome.
Findings areall consistent with bone infarcts consistent with
the patient's known
diagnosis of sickle cell anemia.

ECHO [**3-17**]:
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal
(LVEF 50%). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal left
ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation. The
mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. There is no
mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal.
There is no pericardial effusion.

Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed)
of [**2127-1-9**], the left ventricular ejection fraction is
somewhat lower.

Brief Hospital Course:
46 yo F with sickle cell anemia, multiple admission for pain
crises, who presented with the acute onset bilateral knee,
shoulder, hip, and chest pain. She developed hypoxia and
bilateral pulmonary infiltrates, requiring MICU transfer for
exchange transfusion.

#Sickle cell disease/Acute Chest Syndrome: The patient presented
with severe pain. Her initial chest x-ray was normal. EKG was
normal, and MI was ruled out with serial cardiac enzymes. The
patient was treated with oxygen, IV fluids, and IV Dilaudid for
presumed vaso-occlusive pain crisis. The day after admission,
she developed fever to 101.8 and a progressive oxygen
requirement, with CXR showed bilateral infiltrates and a
massively dilated heart. Due to concern for acute chest
syndrome, she was transferred to the MICU. She was started on
CTX/azithro for coverage of community-acquired pneumonia.

In the MICU, given the patient's high-grade hemolysis and acute
chest syndrome she underwent exchange transfusion on [**2129-3-10**]
with a total of 6 units of PRBC's infused, with a goal of
getting her hemoglobin S concentration under 30%. A right
internal jugular central venous catheter was placed for access.
Her post exchange transfusion hematocrit was 24.5, and initially
remained stable until the morning of [**3-12**] when it dropped to
21.1, she was given 1 unit of PRBC's with improvement only to
22, with a goal hemoglobin of over 8.  She was given another
unit of PRBC's and her Hct stabilized around 28.
