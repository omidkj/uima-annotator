Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 618**]
Chief Complaint:
muteness, right sided weakness

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
intra-arterial TPA administration

History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 53 year old woman with multiple vascular risk
factors now presenting with acute onset muteness and right sided
weakness.  The patient is unable to give a history so the story
is taken from family.  The patient has been in her usual state
of
health until today.  The husband tells me around 5:50 pm, she
told him she was hungry. She was lying on the couch.  He went
outside for about 20 minutes and when he returned at 6:10 he
found her still lying on the couch, unresponsive, starring to
the
left and not moving her right side.  He tried to shake her and
"snap" her out of this state.  When he was unsuccessful, he
called EMS who arrived about 20 minutes later.  She arrived at
[**Hospital1 18**] at 7:10 pm and a code stroke was activated.  Neurology
arrived at the bedside within 30 seconds.  She had a left gaze
preference, decreased movement on the right and a right facial
droop.  She was intubated after vomiting x1 on the stretcher.
She was taken to CT scan which reveal a hyperdense right MCA.
She
was transported back to the ED and preparations were made to
admininster TPA.

[**2101-5-26**] CT/CTA of Head
NON-CONTRAST HEAD CT SCAN:  There is a hyperdense left middle
cerebral artery concerning for hyperdense clot.  There is subtle
hypodensity and effacement of portions of the left temporal lobe
consistent with acute infarction.  There is no evidence of
intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect.  There is no
hydrocephalus.  The osseous structures are unremarkable.  The
visualized paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are well
aerated.
IMPRESSION:
1.  Hyperdense left middle cerebral artery with subtle
hypodensity in the left temporal lobe with focal effacement
consistent with acute infarction.
CTA HEAD:  There is calcific atherosclerotic disease of both
internal carotid arteries. A thrombus is seen at the level of
the left supraclinoid internal carotid artery and there is no
opacification of the left middle cerebral or anterior cerebral
arteries.  The right anterior circulation is unremarkable. The
vertebrobasilar arteries as well as both posterior cerebral
arteries are patent.
IMPRESSION:
1.  Clot at the level of the left supraclinoid internal carotid
artery.  This results in occlusion of the left anterior cerebral
and middle cerebral arteries.

NOTE ADDED AT ATTENDING REVIEW: There is poor opacification of
the
vasculature throughout the left middle and anterior cerebral
artery
territories suggesting infarction in this region.

[**5-26**] CXR:
SINGLE PORTABLE AP SUPINE CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  The patient is
status post median sternotomy, skin staples are still seen in
the midline.  The endotracheal tube is 3.3 cm above the carina.
OG tube tip is not visualized but is below the diaphragm.  There
are bilateral perihilar opacities as well as increased
interstitial markings. Cardiomegaly.   There are bilateral
pleural effusions.
IMPRESSION:
1.  Pulmonary edema
2.  Endotracheal tube and orogastric tube in appropriate
positions.

ia-TPA Procedure:
PROCEDURE:  Following written informed consent from the
patient's family, the patient was positioned supine on the
angiography table.  Potential risks of the procedure discussed
with the family included hemorrhage/bleeding from a portion of
the body including the brain, worsened stroke, lack of
successful treatment, death, vessel injury, and need for
surgery.  Preprocedure timeout was performed to confirm patient,
procedure, and site.  Standard sterile prep and drape of the
inguinal regions bilaterally.  Local anesthesia with 7 cc of 1%
lidocaine subcutaneously in the right inguinal region.  General
anesthesia
was administered by the anesthesiology service.  Using
combination of
palpatory and fluoroscopic guidance, a 19-gauge single wall
puncture of the right limb of the patient's aortobifemoral
bypass graft was performed.  A 0.035-inch guidewire was advanced
through the needle into the abdominal aorta using fluoroscopic
guidance.  Needle was exchanged for a 6-French vascular sheath,
which was attached to continuous heparinized saline flush.
Using a 6- French MPD catheter, the left common carotid artery
was selected and common carotid arteriography was performed.
The catheter was then advanced into the left internal carotid
artery.  The microcatheter and microwire were used to attempt to
gain access to the thrombus/embolus.  The catheter was
positioned at the trailing edge of the embolus.  Based on the
findings of a diagnostic arteriogram, it was determined the
patient may benefit from was a suitable candidate for
intraarterial thrombolysis.  A total of 4 mg of intraarterial
TPA was administered from this catheter position in divided
doses of 1 mg
each.  Note that the patient already received a maximal dose of
intravenous TPA.  No effect was noted from the intraarterial
TPA.  On comparison between the diagnostic arteriogram and the
previously performed CT arteriogram there was no change in the
clot burden between the two studies accounting for differences
in technique.  At this poi
