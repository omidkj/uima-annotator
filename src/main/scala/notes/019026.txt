Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4162**]
Chief Complaint:
Seizure

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation
PICC line placement


History of Present Illness:
The pt. is a 68 year-old right-handed woman with recently
diagnosed carcinoma of the lung with metastases to the brain who
presented with seizure.

Per the pt's family, she was in her usual state of health this
morning.  At approximtely 2:30 this afternoon, she was found
lying on the ground by her grandchildren with shaking movements
of her limbs, apparently having a seizure.  911 was immediately
called.  It is not known how long she was down prior to being
discovered by her grandchildren, she was last seen "a few
minutes" prior to being found.

EMS arrived approximately 10 minutes after the seizure began.
EMS found the pt to have clonic activity of her right upper and
lower extremities and with forced eye deviation to the right.
She was given 6mg of IV ativan by EMS en route to the ED.  She
received an additional 4mg of IV ativan in the ED (total dose
10mg).  The seizure activity ceased in the ED, roughly 35
minutes from onset. After cessation of seizure activity, she was
intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation.  She received
1.5 grams of intravenous dilantin when her level was discovered
to be subtherapeutic (1.5). A CT scan of the head was performed.



Past Medical History:
-non-small cell carcinoma of the lung with multiple hemorrhagic
metastases to brain in both frontal lobes and right temporal
lobe
-renal cell carcinoma: resected in [**2103**] with a left nephrectomy

in [**2102**] that was removed surgically in [**2105**] with extracapsular
extension, and vascular invasion.  She underwent postoperative
RAI followed by radiation therapy.  In [**2108-8-24**], a
persistently elevated thyroglobulin prompted retreatment with
radioactive iodine.

[**1-22**] CT HEAD FINDINGS: Again seen are multiple hemorrhagic foci
in both frontal lobes as well as the right temporal lobe.
Overall, they are less prominent than on the prior exam. No new
foci of hemorrhage are identified. Note is made of slightly
increased hypodensity adjacent to the anterior most right
frontal hemorrhage compared to the head CT of [**2111-1-3**].
However, this difference may be secondary to volume averaging
and no new hemorrhage is identified in this area. There is no
new mass effect, hydrocephalus, or shift of normally midline
structures. A calcified right frontal meningioma is again noted
near the vertex. Surrounding osseous and soft tissue structures
are remarkable only for a small amount of aerosolized secretions
in the sphenoid sinus..
.
[**1-22**] CXR: PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS: Again seen is small
left lung volume with diffuse nodular thickening of the pleura
compatible with the patient's known metastatic disease.
Elevation of the left hemidiaphragm has slightly increased
compared to the prior examination and may represent increasing
subpulmonic or subdiaphragmatic fluid collection/mass. The right
lung is clear. Heart size is normal. Note is again made of
surgical clips in the left mid abdomen. Note is again made of
laminectomy defects of the cervicothoracic junction.


Brief Hospital Course:
Briefly, 68 yo woman c renal cell CA, invasive papillary
thyroid, NSCLC c brain mets admit [**1-23**] for status epilepticus
responsive to IV benzos.
.
Noted to be subtherapeutic on dilantin prior to admission.
Intubated.  In ICU developed Klebsiella bacteremia thought [**2-26**]
urinary source, MRSA PNA.  Started on vanco/meropenem and
switched to vanco/ceftriaxone.   Also kept on dilantin while
keppra titrated up.  Developed urinary retention following
removal of Foley catheter; Foley reinserted and 1 L urine
drained.  Urology consulted.  Noted to have low free T4 on
[**2111-1-29**] labs.
.
1. Infections - Likey etiology of Klebsiella bacteremia is UTI.
MRSA PNA probably related to intubation.  HD stable.  WBC
elevated though likely leukocytosis [**2-26**] present dexamethasone
use.  Uctx [**1-29**] c 1000 col probably enterococcus; abx not changed
in response to this finding.
- Vancomycin since [**2111-1-25**] (for 14 day course)
- Ceftriaxone since [**2111-1-27**] (for 14 day course)
- f/u urine culture sensitivities from [**1-29**]
.
2. Seizures - Plan to receive full dose keppra and then d/c
phenytoin with gradual taper. For brain mets, pt. on
dexamethosone
- 1250 [**Hospital1 **] * 3 d of keppra until [**2111-2-1**] then 1500 [**Hospital1 **] continous
keppra.
- [**2111-2-1**] dilantin decreased to 100 mg [**Hospital1 **] (plan to decrease by
100mg q 3d)
- plan to reduce steroids by [**1-2
