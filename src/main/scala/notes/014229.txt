Admission Date:  [**2119-7-5**]     Discharge Date:  [**2119-7-17**]


Service:  Medical Intensive Care Unit

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 86-year-old
female who was brought to the Emergency Department for
evaluation after she was noted to be bradycardic with a heart
rate in the 40s while at an outpatient echocardiogram.

Earlier that week, at a visit to her primary care doctor, she
had extensive medication changes; including the addition of
multiple hypertensive medications.  She was instructed to
discontinue some of her other medications, but she thought
that she might still be taking them up to the time of
admission.

On presentation to the Emergency Department she complained of
diffuse abdominal pain for two days; especially
postprandially.  Therefore, she had decreased oral intake
during the past two days.  On the day of admission, she
reports multiple episodes of nonbloody emesis.  She reports
that her bowel movements have been normal.  She denied chest
pain.  No shortness of breath or dizziness, but she does
report that she has been feeling increasingly fatigued.

In the Emergency Department, her blood pressure was found to
be 90/50, heart rate was in the 40s, with a regular rate and
rhythm of 20.  Her creatinine was 2, and her potassium was
7.5 on initial laboratories.  She was admitted to the Medical
Intensive Care Unit for workup and treatment of symptomatic
bradycardia.

ALLERGIES:

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives alone in an apartment in
[**Location (un) **].  She has no history of tobacco or alcohol
consumption.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Physical examination
on admission revealed vital signs with a temperature of 93.6,
blood pressure was 93/28, heart rate was in the 40s, and
oxygen saturation was 98% on room air.  Generally, a
pleasant, elderly, slightly overweight woman who appeared
somewhat uncomfortable but was conversing appropriately.
Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat examination revealed
pupils were equal, round, and reactive to light.  Sclerae
were anicteric.  The oropharynx was very dry.  The neck with
prominent regurgitation in the internal jugular vein.  The
chest was clear to auscultation bilaterally.  Cardiovascular
examination revealed bradycardic with a 2/6 systolic murmur.
The abdomen was diffusely tender and slightly distended.  No
bowel sounds.  Rectal examination was trace guaiac-positive.
Extremity examination revealed 2+ edema to the knees.
Neurologic examination was nonfocal.

PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:   Laboratories
on admission revealed white blood cell count was 12.1,
hematocrit was 32.1, and platelets were 339.  Coagulations
revealed prothrombin time was 28.7, partial thromboplastin
time was 34.9, and INR was 5.5.  Sodium was 136, potassium
was 7.5, chloride was 102, bicarbonate was 15, blood urea
nitrogen was 49, creatinine was 2, and blood glucose was 189.
Lipase was 26.   Calcium was 9.9, phosphorous was 5.9, and
magnesium was 2.5.  Creatine phosphokinase was 48.  Troponin
was less than 0.3.  Arterial blood gas revealed pH was 7.14
and lactate was 8.1.  Urinalysis was negative.

PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  Electrocardiogram was irregular
with a rate in the 40s with peaked P waves.  No visible T
waves.

A chest x-ray showed mild upper zone redistribution.

HOSPITAL COURSE BY ISSUE/SYSTEM:  The patient was admitted to
the Medical Intensive Care Unit for treatment of bradycardia,
hyperkalemia, acidosis, and abdominal pain.

She was in the Intensive Care Unit for five days before being
transferred to the floor.

1.  CARDIOGENIC SHOCK ISSUES:  Her blood pressure improved as
all antihypertensive medications except for Lopressor had
been stopped.  Her blood pressure continued to improve until
the day of discharge, at which point it was 138/70.  Some of
her other antihypertensive medications were added by that
time.

2.  METABOLIC ACIDOSIS ISSUES:  The patient was treated in
the Intensive Care Unit with bicarbonate, and the metabolic
acidosis resolved.

3.  ATRIAL FIBRILLATION ISSUES:  Coumadin had initially been
held on admission pending a full gastrointestinal workup.
When that issue had been resolved, she was restarted on her
Coumadin prior to discharge.

4.  SHOCKED LIVER ISSUES:  As a result of her bradycardia,
the patient's liver enzymes became extremely elevated.  Her
enzymes continued to trend down throughout her hospital stay.

5.  BOWEL ISCHEMIA ISSUES:  The patient was noted to have one
episode of bright red blood per rectum in the Intensive Care
Unit and the Gastroenterology Service was consulted.

The patient had two more episodes of bloody bowel movements
once transferred out of the Medical Intensive Care Unit.  A
colonoscopy was performed which revealed ulceration,
erythema, and friability in the ascending colon and
transverse colon; compatible with ischemic colitis.
Otherwise, a normal colonoscopy to the cecum.  The patient
tolerated the procedure well.  She had no more episodes of
bright red blood per rectum after the colonoscopy.

6.  ATRIAL FIBRILLATION ISSUES:  The patient had good rate
control with a new dose of metoprolol.  Coumadin was
restarted prior to discharge.

DISCHARGE DISPOSITION:   Once the patient was sent to the
floor, she persistently felt at her baseline and felt ready
return to her normal activities.  Physical Therapy came to
see her and documented that the patient was able to return
home without home physical therapy.

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  Condition on discharge was stable.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Symptomatic bradycardia.
2.  Cardiogenic shock.
3.  Shocked liver.
4.  Acute renal failure.
5.  Ischemic colitis.
6.  Atrial fibrillation.
7.  Hypertension.
