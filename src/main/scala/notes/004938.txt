History of Present Illness:
80 year old male with severe aortic stenosis, admitted [**1-14**] for
presyncope, attributed to micturition syncope, and in [**2-14**] with
chest pain, likely [**3-9**] aortic stenosis or CAD (ruled out for
ACS). On that admission he underwent stress testing but only
achieved 2.2 mets, he was discharged with addition of ASA 81mg
to his medication regimen.  He remains active and has been able
to walk up/down stairs in his home w/o symptoms. He had a
cardiac cath on [**3-22**] which revealed nonobstructive CAD.  He is
admitted today for heparin bridge with plans for AVR

Past Medical History:
Mohs resection of an invasive squamous cell carcinoma in the
right postauricular area which required a repeat resection with
skin grafting.  A lymph node showed direct extension of atypical
squamous cells, but there were no other lymph node metastases.

Findings
LEFT ATRIUM: Mild LA enlargement. No thrombus in the LAA.
RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: A catheter or pacing wire is
seen in the RA and extending into the RV. No ASD by 2D or color
Doppler.
LEFT VENTRICLE: Mild symmetric LVH. Overall normal LVEF (>55%).
RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.
AORTA: Normal ascending aorta diameter. Complex (>4mm) atheroma
in the descending thoracic aorta. No thoracic aortic dissection.

AORTIC VALVE: Bicuspid aortic valve. Severely thickened/deformed
aortic valve leaflets. Critical AS (area <0.8cm2). Mild (1+) AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. Mild
mitral annular calcification. Mild (1+) MR.
TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets. Mild [1+] TR.
PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflets.
Physiologic (normal) PR.
GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify I was present in compliance with HCFA
regulations. The patient was under general anesthesia throughout
the procedure. The TEE probe was passed with assistance from the
anesthesioology staff using a laryngoscope. No TEE related
complications. Results were personally reviewed with the MD
caring for the patient.
Conclusions
PRE-CPB:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. No thrombus is seen in the
left atrial appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or
color Doppler.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending thoracic
aorta and the distal arch. No mobile components are seen. No
thoracic aortic dissection is seen.
The aortic valve is functionally bicuspid with fusion of the
left and right coronary cusps. The aortic valve leaflets are
severely thickened/deformed. There is critical aortic valve
stenosis (valve area <0.8cm2). Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is
seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen.
POST-CPB:
There is a bioprosthetic valve in the aortic position. The valve
is well-seated with normal leaflet mobility. There is a small
sewing ring leak seen in the deep transgastric view that is not
well visualized in the mid-esophageal long-axis or AV en face
views. This leak disappeared after protamine administration.
There is no AI.
There is evidence of [**Male First Name (un) **] with turbulent flow in the LVOT by
color Doppler and increased MR. This was managed medically with
volume loading and increasing afterload with phenylephrine
infusion. [**Male First Name (un) **] resolved with these maneuvers and there was return
of laminar flow in LVOT and the MR returned to mild.
The LV chamber is small, consistent with hypovolemia. The LV
systolic function remains normal.
There is no evidence of dissection.


Brief Hospital Course:
Admitted preoperatively for bridge from coumadin, placed on
heparin drip for anticoagulation.  He completed preoperative
workup and on [**4-27**] was brought to the operating room and
underwent aortic valve replacement.  See operative report for
further details.  Post-operatively he was transferred to the
intensive care unit for post operative management. In the first
twenty four hours he was weaned from sedation, awoke, and was
extubated without complications.  His internal pacemaker was
in
