Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2167**]
Chief Complaint:
Cough, hemoptysis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Pericardial Drain
Angioseal to Right Ventricle s/p pericardial drain insertion
into right ventricle
Embolisation of right bronchial artery
Bronchoscopy

History of Present Illness:
This is a 71 year old woman with a 10 year history of non-small
cell carcinoma of the lung who is transferred from [**Hospital 4199**]
Hospital for care for a pericardial effusion as well as for
potential treatment of hemoptysis. She is status post a number
of courses of chemotherapy and radiation.
She initially presented to the [**Last Name (un) 4199**] ED with increasing
hemoptysis. Per the ED note she reported having coughed up a
large amount of blood 1.5 months prior to presentation, and then
4 days prior the bleeding increased again. She also was having
chest pain with coughing (and only with coughing), described by
the [**Last Name (un) 4199**] ED report as intermittent and sharp and associated
with shortness of breath.
She had a chest x-ray there and per report had a dense opacity
in the right upper lobe with moderate airspace opacity in the
right lower lobe with loss of lung volume; as well as mild
mediastinal shift to the right and decreased aeration of the
right lung. She had a Hct of 32.1 with 88% neutrophils; and a K
of 3.4. She was reportedly tachycardic in the 110s-120s and
afebrile through her stay there and per the discharge summary
these heart rates have been typical of her for the past "several
weeks".
She has been seen here at the [**Hospital1 18**] earlier in [**2189**] for an
attempt to stent her bronchus; this did not improve symptoms.
In discussion with the patient and her family (including son
[**Name (NI) 54826**] and daughters [**Name (NI) 504**], [**Name (NI) 21212**], and [**Month (only) 116**]), with a [**Hospital1 18**] Chinese
interpreter, history was made somewhat difficult by the fact
that Ms [**Known lastname **] is hard-of-hearing and evidently speaks a rural
mainland Chinese Cantonese dialect distinct from the [**Location (un) 6847**]
dialect spoken by her children and the [**Hospital1 18**] interpreter.
Nonetheless, a review of systems suggested that hemoptysis and
pain with coughing have been the most troubling symptoms; there
has been no fever, chills, or sweats; she has had some white
sputum when it is not bloody, but no other color of sputum; she
denies troubling palpations although she says her heart beats
much faster with exertion; she occasionally has chest tightness
but distinct chest tightness or pain is not a prominent symptom;
she does not have pain elsewhere.
On arrival in MICU 7, her vitals were HR 122 BP 96/69 (map 67)
RR 24 88% RA. She came up to high 90s for O2 sat with nasal
cannula.

Social History:
The patient grew up in mainland [**Country 651**] and then raised her
children in [**Location (un) 6847**]. No tobacco or asbestos exposure. Has
lived in [**Location (un) 6847**], [**Location (un) **], and the United States; worked as a
kitchen worker; now lives with son and daughter-in-law. [**Name (NI) **] is
[**Name (NI) 54826**], daughters are [**Name (NI) 21212**], [**First Name3 (LF) 116**], and [**Name (NI) **]. [**Male First Name (un) 54826**] is informal
family decisionmaker while [**Doctor First Name 21212**] is the spokesperson as she is
the best English speaker. Relevant to this admission, husband
died after apparent pericardiocentesis.

CULTURE DATA:
[**2190-1-7**] Coag negative staph and clostridium species
[**1-8**], [**1-9**] blood cultures with no growth to date
[**1-10**] pericardial catheter IV tip no growth to date
.
[**2190-1-7**] 5:00 pm FLUID, PERICARDIAL.  no growth to date.
.
STUDIES:
[**1-7**] ECHO
Moderate circumferential pericardial effusion with evidence of
pericardial tamponade. Left ventricular function is
hyperdynamic. The right ventricle appears small and compressed
during systole and diastole. The heart is moving around within
the effusion with the result that the minimal amount of fluid
anteriorly can be as little as 0.7cm. The majority of the fluid
is at the apex (more than 2cm wide).
.
[**1-9**] ECHO
Small organized pericardial effusion, without echocardiographic
signs of tamponade physiology
.
[**1-11**] ECHO: There is a very small, primarily inferolateral
echogenic pericardial effusion without evidence for hemodynamic
compromise.
.
[**1-7**] CARDIAC CATH: PLACEMENT OF PERICARDIAL DRAIN
1.  Pericardiocentesis was performed with removal of 350 ml of
bloody
fluid. 2.  Resting hemodynamics revealed elevated right and left
sided filling pressures with RVEDP of 20 mm Hg and mean PCWP of
22 mm Hg.  The
pericardial pressure was 11 mm Hg as was the initial RA mean.
This is
consistent with tamponade physiology.  Following the drainage of
350 ml
of sanguinous fluid, Pericardial pressure became neagtive with
respiration.  The systemic arterial blood pressure was normal at
119/65
mm Hg.  The cardiac index was preserved at 3.4 l/min/m2. 3.
Prior to successful pericardiocentesis, initial attempts to
acess the pericardial space led to early removal of bloody
fluid, with a transduced pressue similar to RA mean pressure.
This was believed to be pericardial pressure.  However, after
draining 60-100 ml of fluid, the patient became hypotensive, and
contrast injection through the catheter revealed opacification
of the pulmonary artery, suggesting entry into the RA. FINAL
DIAGNOSIS: 1. Successful pericardiocentesis 2. Pericardial
effusion with tamponade physiology. 3. Procedure complicated by
placement of pericardial drainage catheter into the right
atrium.
.
[**1-8**] IR REPORT (PRELIM)
Successful embolization of the right bronchial artery.
Intercostal artery
inferior to the right bronchus and artery was identified, which
was also
supplying the tumor activity. If the patient's hemoptysis does
not stop,
selective embolization of this intercostal artery can be
offered.
.
[**1-10**] CXR: The right-sided PICC line has been readjusted, and
the distal tip is now in the right subclavian/axillary vein
junction. There is again noted deformity of the right chest wall
