Admission Date:  [**2177-1-20**]     Discharge Date:  [**2177-1-29**]


Service:  [**Last Name (un) 52440**] service then Medical Intensive Care Unit,
then Medical service

REASON FOR ADMISSION:  Left hip pain status post fall.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 82-year-old female
nursing home resident with bipolar disorder, dementia, and
known gait disorder, who presents after a mechanical fall
that was witnessed at a nursing home on [**2177-1-19**].  The
patient did not suffer head trauma or loss of consciousness.
The left leg was noted to be shortened.  The patient was
unable to ambulate.  A x-ray at the nursing home revealed a
left hip intertrochanteric fracture, and the patient was
referred to the [**Hospital1 **] [**First Name (Titles) 2142**] [**Last Name (Titles) **] for
further management.

Additional history is limited as the patient answers yes to
every question and has known dementia at baseline.  She does
note leg pain, chest pressure, shortness of breath, and
abdominal pain.  In the Emergency Room, the patient was
anxious in mild distress and was diaphoretic.  Heart rate was
noted to be in the 120s, oxygen saturation 95% on 6 liters
with a respiratory rate of 26.  ECG showed sinus tachycardia
with Q waves in leads V4 through V6 without prior for
comparison.  Patient was given aspirin and Morphine.

CT of the head was performed, and was negative.  C spine
x-ray was performed and was negative for fractures or
displacement.  Chest x-ray showed a question of diffuse
infiltrates without evidence of pulmonary edema.

Given the patient's hemodynamic instability, a right femoral
line was placed for access.  The Orthopedic service was
consulted for further management and plan for open reduction,
internal fixation after the medical team had performed a
preoperative risk stratification and optimization.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Unknown.

PHYSICAL EXAM AT TIME OF ADMISSION:  Temperature 98.5, blood
pressure 118/79, heart rate 109, respirations 20, and oxygen
saturation 97% on 1 liter, subsequently 98% on 6 liters.
Physical exam reveals an elderly female in no apparent
distress, alert and oriented to person only, able to
converse, but answers yes to all questions.  No evidence of
scleral icterus.  Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to
light and accommodation.  Moist mucous membranes.  No
evidence of head lacerations or ecchymosis appreciated.
Lungs:  Positive wheezes bilaterally.  Cardiac exam:
Tachycardic, regular rhythm without evidence of murmurs,
rubs, clicks, or gallops.  Abdomen is soft, mildly tender to
palpation, no obvious distress with palpation of the abdomen,
normoactive bowel sounds.  No masses or hepatosplenomegaly.
Extremities:  No lower extremity edema.  The left leg is
shortened.  There are prominent dorsalis pedis pulses
appreciated bilaterally.

DATA:  White blood cells 9.1 with a differential of 83%
neutrophils, 10% lymphocytes, 6% monocytes, hematocrit 34.1,
platelets 326.  INR is 1.2.  Chem-7:  140, 4.6, 102, 28, 31,
0.6, 175.  The CK was 88 with an initial troponin-T of less
than 0.01.  Urinalysis revealed a specific gravity of 1.025,
pH of 7.0, negative leukocyte esterase, negative nitrite,
negative glucose, 15 ketones.

Chest x-ray shows a question of a patchy opacity at the right
costophrenic angle and possible evidence of aspiration
pneumonia versus atelectasis without evidence of CHF.

CT of the head shows no intracranial hemorrhage, no mass
effect, chronic microvascular infarctions.

C spine x-ray demonstrates no evidence of fracture.

Hip x-ray at the nursing home demonstrates a left
intertrochanteric fracture with normal mid distal femur.  The
hip x-ray at [**Hospital3 **] demonstrates a left femur
trochanteric fracture with avulsion of the lesser trochanter.

BRIEF SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was initially
admitted to the Medicine service.

1. Orthopedic:  The Orthopedic service was consulted, and
planned for open reduction, internal fixation with
preoperative medical evaluation.  Perioperative beta-blockers
were used and this surgery was considered a medium-risk
surgery with the patient could perform less than 4 mets and
had probably suffered a prior myocardial infarction.
However, showed no evidence of active ischemia.

As the patient was a DNR/DNI, the DNR/DNI status was reversed
pending the operation.

On [**2177-1-20**], an open reduction, internal fixation of the left
intertrochanteric fracture was performed by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 1022**].  The
postoperative course was complicated by apparent myocardial
ischemia with the patient complaining of chest pressure on
the morning following the operation with a CPK rise to 653
with a negative troponin.  She was started on aspirin and
Heparin drips.  Nevertheless, as well as beta-blocker to keep
the heart rate in the 60s-70s range.  The patient then
developed hypotension with a mean arterial pressure in the
60s and was started on Neo-Synephrine at 1-2 mcg.

Patient was also hypoxic with an arterial blood gas
demonstrating a pH of 7.37, pCO2 of 39, and a pO2 of 63 on
50% face mask.  It was felt that the patient's decompensation
was secondary to combination of preoperative pneumonia on top
of intraoperative blood loss, hypovolemia, and underlying
COPD.  There was also a question of aspiration of pills while
in the PACU.

2. Hypotension:  The patient was transfused 1 unit of packed
red blood cells with good hematocrit response to keep her
hematocrit greater than 30.  The Neo-Synephrine drip was
weaned as tolerated, and as of [**2177-1-23**], the patient was off
of pressors.

3. Pulmonary status:  As stated above, the patient had
underlying COPD and probably underlying pneumonia prior to
her surgery as well as aspiration in the perioperative
period.  She was started on albuterol nebulizers, IV
steroids, levofloxacin, and continued to be intubated and was
taken, intubated to the Medical Intensive Care Unit, where
she initially did quite well and was extubated on [**2177-1-24**].

However, on [**2177-1-25**], the patient developed increasing
tachypnea and had oxygen desaturation to the low 80s.  She
was initially placed on BiPAP, weaned to a face mask, and had
aggressive nasotracheal suctioning of tenacious secretions.
This was not sufficient to allow output oxygenation and
ventilation.  The patient was reintubated on [**2177-1-26**].

Given the patient's prior expressed wishes that she have her
goals of care oriented towards to non-aggressive treatment, a
family meeting was held at which time her healthcare proxy
was present and it was decided that the patient would be made
comfort measures only and electively extubated with the
realization that she would probably not be able to sustain
her respiratory function without the use of the endotracheal
tube.

4. Infectious disease:  The patient was thought to have an
aspiration pneumonia, and there was a question of septic
shock as she once again required pressors as of [**2177-2-24**].
She was placed on triple antibiotic coverage with
clindamycin, cefazolin, and levofloxacin to cover for
gram-negative organisms, anaerobic species, as well as
perioperative coverage of Staphylococcus aure
