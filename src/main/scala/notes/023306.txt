Chief Complaint:
sob and chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
cardiac cath ([**2127-2-7**])

History of Present Illness:
68 yo male with extensive PMH includes diastolic CHF, probable
CAD, s/p pacer for CHB, PE ([**2125**]), htn, dyslipidemia, tracheal
stenosis s/p multiple T-tubes, dilations, stents, COPD, OSA, h/o

progressing but subsequently pt did not have his recommended
nuclear stress test.  In the interim, Mr.[**Known lastname 105663**] SOB has
progressed to occuring with minimal exertion and occasionally at
rest.  His CP also increased with a particularly severe episode

with dyspnea without relief with ntg).  Mr.[**Name14 (STitle) 105664**] also notes
increased LE edema and LE pain. Seen by Dr.[**Last Name (STitle) 5717**] in clinic today
who sent the pt via ambulance to ED.

[**2127-2-6**] EKG:  No change from previous.  NSR.  LAD.  Poor RWP.  No
Q's.  Normal [**Doctor Last Name 1754**] and intervals.

[**2127-2-6**] RLE u/s: No evidence of DVT in the right lower extremity.

RIGHT FOOT, THREE VIEWS: There is a hallux valgus deformity of
the first toe. There is diffuse osteopenia. There are no obvious
fractures, given the patient's positioning. Soft tissue swelling
dorsally. Erosion of the first distal tarsal bone.  No definite
fracture.

[**2-6**] CXR:  There is pulmonary vascular congestion and
interstitial edema.

[**2-7**] ECHO:
1. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Due to suboptimal
technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be
fully excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
difficult to assess but may be normal.
2. The aortic root is moderately dilated. The ascending aorta is
moderately dilated.
3.The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+)
aortic
regurgitation is seen.
4.The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+)
mitral
regurgitation is seen.
5. Compared with the findings of the prior study (tape reviewed)
of [**2126-11-13**], there has been no significant change.

1. 2VD, right dominant ciruclation. LMCA without
angiographically apparent flow limiting disease. The LAD had
diffuse disease up to 90% in the proximal-mid vessel with
extensive calcifications. A large D1 was occluded chronically.
The LCX had mild disease throughtout its course to the AV
groove. The OM1 was a large caliber vessel without flow limiting
disease. The RCA had a 50% stenosis in the proximal vessel and
an occluded posterolateral branch that was occluded.
2. Resting hemodynamics from right and left heart
catheterization
demonstrated elevated right and left sided filling pressures
(RVEDP=17mmHg and LVEDP=28mmHg). Pulmonary arterial hypertension
was
noted (41/10mmHg). The superior vena cava oxygen saturation was
elevated
suggesting the possibility of partial anomalous pulmonary venous
return,
of unknown significance.
3. Successful placement of two overlapping Cypher drug-eluting
stents in
the proximal (3.0 x 23 mm) and mid-LAD (2.5 x 28 mm) after
successful
rotational atherectomy using a 1.5 mm burr.
4. Successful balloon angioplasty of chronically, totally
occluded
diagonal with a 2.5 mm balloon. Final angiography demonstrated a
40%
residual stenosis, no angiographically apparent dissection, and
normal
flow.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Two vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Elevated right and left sided filling pressures.
3. Preserved cardiac output/index on dopamine.
4. Successful placement of drug-eluting stents in proximal-mid
LAD.
5. Successful balloon angioplasty of diagonal branch.

CT ABD/PELVIS [**2-14**]:  No evidence of retroperitoneal hemorrhage.
Stable appearance of large lung bleb in the right lower lobe.
Vicarious excretion of contrast through the gallbladder.
Multiple small exophytic left renal cysts.

[**2-14**] CXR: The pulmonary vasculature bilaterally appears
prominent. A circular opacity surrounding the right middle lobe
is again seen and corresponds with the right middle lobe emboli
identified on a CT on the chest recently on [**2126-11-12**].
There is diffuse opacification of bilateral lungs, which is
stable since the prior exam, and is consistent with pulmonary
congestion. An underlying infiltrate consolidation cannot be
excluded.

[**2-16**] CXR:  Severe degree of bilateral pulmonary infiltration is
noted diffusely throughout both lungs.

[**2-19**] CXR:  The appearance of bilateral lungs with diffuse
bilateral alveolar opacities is largely unchanged. The above
findings remain consistent with the diagnosis of congestive
heart failure.

[**2-23**] CXR:  There has been interval improvement in the degree of
perihilar haziness. There is a small right pleural effusion
present. There is improved aeration in th
