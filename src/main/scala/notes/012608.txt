History of Present Illness:
59 y/o man with PMH significant for hypercholesterolemia, HTN,
and [**Hospital 22982**] transferred from [**Hospital3 **] for further care for
ARF and question of multiple myeloma. Pt was in his usual state
of health until mid [**7-/2101**] when he noted that he was feeling
poorly with fatigue, low grade fevers of 99, and nausea. The pt
was seen in his PCP's office where he reports numerous labs were
drawn that did not show any abnormality. However, the pt
continued to have the above symptoms. Then, in late [**9-/2101**] he
"strained" his back lifting some heavy items while doing a home
remodeling project. The discomfort improved slowly with
ibuprofen until [**10/2101**] when he fell while fishing and struck
his back. He has experienced increasing back pain since that
time. Two weeks after the accident, he presented to his PCP for
further evaluation. At that time, films revealed compression
fractures of L1 and L3. The pt was prescribed percocet and also
continued on ibuprofen for the pain. However, it continued to
worsen to the point where he was bed bound and needing a cane
for ambulation. He also experienced severe nausea and
constipation. On [**2101-12-5**], the pt presented to [**Hospital3 **]
for further care. At that time, he rated his back pain [**11-1**].
The pt was found to have lumbar and rib fractures in addition to
hypercalcemia, ARF, and anemia. A body scan was then obtained on
[**2101-12-6**] for further evaluation showing bilateral renal
enlargement without evidence of excretion (nonspecific but
compatible with infiltrative disease or acute
glomerulonephritis), increased uptake in left ribs, increased
uptake in multiple joints suggesting polyarthirits, and
increased uptake in the epigastrium. The pt also had multiple
other radiology studies--- please see below for the individual
results. Of note, at the time he entered the OSH, the pt had
been taking 1200 mg of ibuprofen daily for approximately six
weeks.
.
Tonight, the pt reports that he continues to have severe back
pain with any movement. It does not radiate but is localized to
his lumbar back. He reports that he has had several stools with
resolution of his constipation. His nausea is also much better
but his appetite remains poor. Of note, the pt had noted
decreased urine output at home but had attributed this to
deydration secondary to his poor PO intake. At this time, he
reports that he is making large amounts of urine.

Pertinent Results:
Labs from [**Hospital3 **]:
([**12-6**]) C-ANCA- <1:20    P-ANCA- <1:20    C3 complement- 144
C4 complement- 39
([**12-10**]) WBC- 9.4, Hct- 25.7, platelets- 252, Na- 142, K- 3.8,
chloride- 117, bicarb- 14, BUN- 75, creatinine- 6.6, glucose- 83
.
CXR ([**12-7**])- Heat size is within normal limits. No acute
infiltrate seen. Pleural thickening laterally on the left.
Question healing left fifth rib fracture. Costophrenic angle is
minimally blunted.
.
AP and lateral thoracic spine ([**12-7**])- Bones are osteoporotic.
There are significant blastic and lytic changes in the T3
vertebral body with loss of height suspicious for metastatic
disease. On the AP film, the spinous processes are aligned.
Pedicles are intact.
.
Lumbar spine ([**12-7**])- Moderate loss of vertebral body height of
L1 and L2. No destructive porcess seen. However, metastatic
disease involving the bone cannot be excluded. Bones overall are
osteoporotic. On the AP film, spinous processes are aligned and
pedicles are intact.
.
Lateral film cervical spine ([**12-7**])- C1 through C6 is
identified. C7 is not seen. Vertebral bodies are aligned. No
significant loss of height. Minimal disc space narrowing at
C5-C6.
.
Lateral film skull ([**12-7**])- Small lucencies seen throughout the
skull questionable for metastatic disease.
.
AP pelvis ([**12-7**])- Both hips are internally rotated. No obvious
fracture on the single view. Limited images of the iliac bones
show no fracture. There is overlying stool and feces.
.
Single view right femur ([**12-7**])- No blastic or lytic lesions
seen.
.
Single view left femur ([**12-7**])- No blastic of lytic lesions
seen.
.
Single view right humerous ([**12-7**])- No blastic or lytic lesions
seen.
.
Single view left humerous ([**12-7**])- No blastic or lytic lesions
seen.
.
Bone scan total body ([**12-6**])- Bilateral renal enlargement
without evidence of excretion. The appearance is nonspecific but
compatible with infiltrative disease or acute
glomerulonephritis. Increased uptake in the left ribs is likely
posttraumatic despite the recent nondiagonstic left rib x-rays.
Increased uptake in multiple joints suggest polyarthritis.
Increased uptake in the epigastrium is a nondiagnostic finding
and is not explained on the basis of either this exam or the
recent abdomen CT scan.
.
Renal US ([**12-5**])- Kidneys are normal without evidence of renal
mass, stone, or obstruction. The right kidney measures 13.0 cm
in length and the left measures 12.5 cm. Small amount of urine
in the bladder.
.
Noncontrast CT scan of abdomen and pelvis ([**12-5**])- Moderate
compression of the L2 vertebral body and mild compression of the
superior endplate of L1. No other definite abnormality is seen.
Sigmoid diverticulosis.
.
Noncontrast CT of T spine ([**12-11**])- Lytic destruction of the T4
verterbal body with extension into the perivertebral tissues
bilaterally.  Posteriorly this extends into and slightly narrows
the spinal canal. Lytic soft tissue lesion within the left T3
transverse process. L1 insufficiency fracture of indeterminate
age. Diffuse bony demineralization. Large bilateral pleural
effusions.
.
Noncontrast CT of L spine ([**12-11**])- Moderate/severe L2 and mild
L1 insufficiency compression fractures. Diffuse bony
demineralization.
.
MRI L-T spine ([**12-12**])- Pathologic compression fracture of T3,
with a soft tissue lesion involving the vertebral body, pedicle
and transverse process.  Epidural soft tissue is also present,
displacing, but not compressing, the spinal cord. Mild chronic
L1 compression fracture. Edema within the L2 vertebral body,
suspicious for a multiple myeloma lesion.
Possible subtle compression fracture as there is mild loss of
vertebral body height.
.
T-spine plain film ([**12-22**])- Patient is status post posterior
thoraci
