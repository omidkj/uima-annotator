Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to the GYN Onc service [**2174-9-26**] secondary
to suspicious for advanced ovarian malignancy with preoperative
CT scan demonstrating marked omental caking, ascites, and
bilateral adnexal masses.  Her CA 125 was 743.  Preoperatively
she was evaluated by medicine.  A TEE was done which was within
normal limits.  A therapeutic thoracentesis was performed and
cytology revealed malignant disease.  VATs procedure did not
demonstrate any visible pulmonary disease.

She had an exploratory laparotomy with optimal tumor debulking.
Please see operative report for full details.  She was
transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] immediately postop given extensive
procedure, pleural effusions, intraop hypotension and
anticipated fluid shifts.  She was monitored closely, given
fluids/ pRBC's for hypotension/ oliguria, and sucessfully
extubated on POD 1.  Given extensive bowel surgery, she remained
NPO after surgery and was started on TPN on POD 2.  She remained
stable and was transferred from the ICU to the floor on POD 2.

She continued on TPN until her diet was advanced and she was
able to tolerate PO's.  Her ostomy appeared healthy throughout
her hospitalization and put out both gas and stool prior to
discharge.

She was weaned from oxygen on POD [**12-23**].  PleurX was in place on
left for intermittent thoracentesis as needed for pulmonary
effusions.  She remained on flovent and albuterol as needed.

She was discharged on POD 17 in stable condition.  She was
ambulating, voiding spontaneously, pain well controlled.  Plan
in place for chemotherapy.
