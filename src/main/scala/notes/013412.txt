abuse and 30 year pack history of smoking.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On physical examination her
temperature was 98.8, her heart rate was 80, blood pressure
182/76, respiratory rate 14.  On physical examination she was
in no acute distress.  She was awake, alert and oriented
times three.  Her chest was clear to auscultation bilaterally
with coarse upper airway sounds.  Her heart was regular rate
and rhythm and the abdomen was soft, nontender.  Pupils were
2.5 down to 2 and briskly reactive.  Cranial nerves II
through XII were intact and symmetric.  Her strength, grasp
was 5 out of 5, biceps 5 out of 5, triceps 5 out of 5, RPs
3-, quads 5 out of 5, AT 5 out of 5, gastrocs 5 out of 5.
She had no drift.  Reflexes were 3+ at the knees, 2+ at the
ankles or toes, on the right were upgoing and on the left
were equivocal.  Sensation was decreased in the right lower
extremity and the left lower extremity at the lateral thigh,
medial thigh, anterior shin and soles of the feet.

LABORATORY DATA:  Her magnetic resonance imaging scan showed
an extradural lesion at the T6, T7 level with cord compression,
probably metastatic. Chest
x-ray showed lung lesion.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was taken to the Operating Room
for urgent T6, T7 laminectomies and decompression on [**2161-3-13**].  Postoperatively the patient's vital signs were
stable.  She was awake following commands.  Her grasp was 5
out of 5.  Her legs were 4+ on the right, 5 on the left in
the IPs, the ATs 5- on the right, 5 on the left, gastrocs 5
on the right and 5 on the left.  Sensation was grossly intact
to light touch to the feet and arms.  Her toes were downgoing
bilaterally.  She continued on Decadron 6 mg q. 4 hours.  Her
vital signs were stable and she was monitored in the Recovery
Room over night.  On [**2161-3-15**], the patient was awake
and alert.  Her numbness continued to the right lateral leg,
greater than the left.  Her strength was 5 out of 5 in all
muscle groups and she was transferred to the regular floor.
Her postoperative magnetic resonance imaging scan showed good
decompression.  She was assessed by physical therapy and
occupational therapy and felt to require acute
rehabilitation.  She was also seen by the Hematology/Oncology
Service for her treatment of her small cell cancer of the
lung with spine metastases.  Hematology/Oncology recommended
an magnetic resonance imaging scan of the head which was
negative except for a bony lesion in the left frontal area.
Radiology Oncology was also consulted and the patient will
require chemotherapy as well as radiation therapy as an
outpatient after healing.

The patient was doing well until [**2161-3-18**], when she
had an episode of unresponsiveness, dropped her blood
pressure, heart rate and her oxygen saturations.  The patient
was taken down for a computerized tomography scan of the
chest which showed bilateral subsegmental pulmonary emboli
and the patient was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit
for close monitoring.  She stayed in the Intensive Care Unit
for two days where she remained stable without any further
episodes of unresponsiveness or drop in her saturations.  Her
blood pressure and heart rate were stable and she was
transferred to the regular floor.

On [**2161-3-19**], she was transferred to the regular
floor.  She was again stable and then on [**2161-3-20**],
had another episode of unresponsiveness after walking with
physical therapy.  She dropped her blood pressure slightly to
96/60, her heart rate remained in the 80s.  Her saturations
were 96% on 2 liters.  She was sitting in a chair at the
time.  She was put back to bed, woke up, was talking and
moving all extremities.  She had an electrocardiogram that
showed no changes.  She was sent back down for another
computerized tomographic angiography which showed
improvement of her pulmonary emboli with no new evidence of
pulmonary emboli.  She had no further episodes of decreased
heart rate or oxygen saturation drops and her blood pressure
remained stable.  Laboratory data were sent emergently during
this episode.  Her white count was 10.1, hematocrit 35,
platelets were 176.  Her electrolytes were within normal
limits, sodium 137, potassium 3.45, chloride 102, BUN 12,
creatinine .7, glucose 109.  On [**3-20**], at 4 PM, at the
time of this episode, CPKs were sent.  Her first CPK was 80,
her second one was 289, her third one 255.  The fourth set
which was 403 with an MB of 2.  Her MB when her CPK was 255
was 3.  Troponin was less than .01.  She had no bump in her
troponin level.  She has remained neurologically and
hemodynamically stable since the episode on [**3-20**].  She
has had no further episodes of unresponsiveness.  Her vital
signs have remained stable, though her blood pressure on
[**3-24**] has been in the low 90s.  She has received two
500 cc normal saline fluid boluses.  The patient will follow
up in Hematology/[**Hospital **] Clinic on [**2161-3-26**], but
will get her radiation therapy first.

She remained neurologically stable, continues to have some
back pain.  Her staples will be removed before she is
discharged.
