HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 36-year-old
gentleman with a history of alcoholism, who was transferred
from an outside hospital with alcohol-induced pancreatitis.
While there, he was aggressively hydrated.  He was febrile to
101.4??????F and was started on imipenem and Levaquin.  He was
borderline hypoxic on four liters of oxygen by nasal cannula
and was transferred to [**Hospital1 69**]
for further management of pancreatitis as well as
questionable impending adult respiratory distress syndrome.

COURSE IN MEDICAL INTENSIVE CARE UNIT:  When he arrived at
the medical intensive care unit, the patient was felt to have
some component of volume overload and was diuresed with
improvement in the chest x-ray alveolar infiltrate pattern
and weaning of his oxygen requirement.  He was started on
empiric Levaquin and Flagyl for possible aspiration.  He was
noted to have a coagulopathy and was started on vitamin K.  A
DIC panel was checked and he was found to have an elevated
D-dimer of greater than [**2177**] and a fibrinogen that was normal
at 285.

Over [**2179-8-27**], the patient became increasingly tachypneic
and dropped his oxygen saturations to the 80s and low 90s on
two liters by nasal cannula.  An arterial blood gas was
obtained, which showed the appearance of acute respiratory
alkalosis with a pH of 7.50, pCO2 of 29 and pO2 of 53 on two
liters of oxygen by nasal cannula.

The patient had been bed-bound for approximately one week at
the outside hospital and was not on any prophylaxis.  Given
his A-a gradient, high D-dimer and worsening respiratory
symptoms, a CT angiogram was done, which revealed bilateral
subsegmental filling defects and diffuse ground glass
opacities consistent with fluid overload versus adult
respiratory distress syndrome.  At this time, the patient was
started on heparin for bilateral subsegmental pulmonary
embolism.

The patient did well in the medical intensive care unit.  He
remained hemodynamically stable and his respiratory status
improved consistently, allowing him to be discharged to the
floor on [**2179-8-29**].

ALLERGIES:  There were no known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lived with his wife, [**Name (NI) **].  [**Name2 (NI) **]
was unemployed and a former plumber.  He smoked one and a
half packs per day and drank 12 cans of beer per day.  His
last drink was five days prior to admission.  He had used
cocaine in the past, but denied any current use.

FAMILY HISTORY:  The patient had a father with lung
carcinoma, who died at the age of 63 and was positive for
alcohol abuse.  The patient had a mother with a myocardial
infarction at the age of 58.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Upon arrival to the floor, the patient
had a temperature of 102.1??????F, a blood pressure of 136/80, a
heart rate of 118-122 and an oxygen saturation of 97% on five
liters by nasal cannula.  In general, he was in no acute
distress.  He was alert and oriented.  On head, eyes, ears,
nose and throat examination, the extraocular movements were
intact.  The pupils were equal, round and reactive to light
and accommodation.  The sclerae were anicteric.  The
oropharynx was clear.  The neck was supple without any
jugular venous distention.

The lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally with
bilaterally decreased breath sounds at the bases.  The
cardiovascular examination was a regular rate and rhythm with
a normal S1 and S2 and no murmurs.  The abdomen was soft,
nontender and nondistended with positive bowel sounds.  The
extremities had no edema, cyanosis or clubbing.  On
neurological examination, cranial nerves II through XII were
grossly intact.  Strength was [**5-1**] in all major muscle groups
bilaterally.  The examination was otherwise nonfocal.

LABORATORY DATA:  On admission, the patient had a white blood
cell count of 13,700, hematocrit of 34.9 and platelet count
of 244,000.  Chemistries showed a sodium of 134, potassium of
3.5, chloride of 101, bicarbonate of 20, BUN of 4, creatinine
of 0.6 and glucose of 149.  Anion gap was 13.  The patient
had a prothrombin time of 15, INR of 1.5 and partial
thromboplastin time was 58.2.  Lipase was 53.

RADIOLOGY DATA:  A chest x-ray showed bilateral perihilar
densities, right greater than left, which were improved from
the prior examination.

HOSPITAL COURSE ON FLOOR:  The patient was transferred out of
the medical intensive care unit on [**2179-8-29**], once his
respiratory status had improved.  From a gastrointestinal
standpoint, the patient's pancreatitis was resolving.  His
lipase was noted to be 53, down from the 800s at the outside
hospital, and he was able to tolerate p.o. intake without
difficulty.  He did not require any pain medication.  He
initially complained of diarrhea, which resolved within a few
days on its own.  Stool studies were negative for Clostridium
difficile and fecal leukocytes.  Stool cultures were negative
as well.  At the time of discharge, the patient did not have
any active acute gastrointestinal issues.

The patient had recurrent fever spikes as well as an elevated
white blood cell count.  A CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis
did not reveal any evidence of abscess or phlegmon.  It was
notable for a small amount of pancreatitis ascites, but was
otherwise unremarkable.  The patient had multiple cultures of
his blood, urine and stool, all of which were nondiagnostic.
At this time, the patient was on Levaquin and Flagyl with a
downward trend in the white blood cell count and frequency of
his fevers.  Once a gastrointestinal source was ruled out,
the patient was maintained on Levaquin alone with a continued
response.  No focus of infection was ever determined, but the
patient was continued on a two week course of Levaquin, given
his sustained improved.  On the day of discharge, the patient
had been afebrile for the past 24 hours.

From a pulmonary standpoint, the patient's respiratory status
improved consistently throughout his stay.  He was maintained
on Lovenox while we waited for his Coumadin to become
therapeutic.  The patient had a normal transthoracic
echocardiogram with no right wall motion abnormalities or
increased pulmonary artery pressures.  At the time of
discharge, the patient's oxygen saturation was 100% in room
air and he was ambulating without difficulty.

Given the patient's recent history of alcohol withdrawal, he
was followed by the psychiatry service.  He came to us on
high doses of standing Ativan.  This was switched to Valium
per the psychiatry service and was carefully weaned.  The
patient did not manifest any further evidence of alcohol
withdrawal while on the floor.  The patient had agreed to
participate in an outpatient alcohol rehabilitation program
and will be followed by outpatient psychiatry.  He was
started on Serzone for management of anxiety and depression.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
Levaquin 500 mg p.o. q.d. to complete a 14 day course.
Lovenox.
Coumadin 5 mg p.o. q.d.
Serzone 15 mg p.o. b.i.d.

FOLLOW UP:  The patient will follow up with his primary care
physician, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**First Name (STitle) 4640**], to have his INR checked.  In the
meantime, the patient will be maintained on Lovenox.  He has
been instructed as to the use of the injections.  The patient
will also follow up with outpatient psychiatry and has agreed
to participate in an outpatient alcohol rehabilitation
program.
