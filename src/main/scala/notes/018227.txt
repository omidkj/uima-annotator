Chief Complaint:
Weakness and lethargy, hyponatremia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
PICC line placement

History of Present Illness:
74F with metastatic melanoma s/p CyberKinfe and WBI to brain
mets, currently on vemurafenib, HTN and anxiety who presented to
the ED with 1 week of weakness.  She states that since she
started radiation treatments, which she estimates as
approximately 1 month ago.  She describes the weakness as
generalized and feeling like she has low energy.  She has severe
weakness of her right hand for many months which is unchanged.
She also endorsed weakness of the legs bilaterally.  She is
still able to walk but states that she started using a walker
recently and has trouble standing up from a chair.  She also
states that for the past week she has felt increasingly nauseous
with dry heaves.  During this time, she has had poor PO intake.

She endorses cough productive of clear sputum for the past [**3-4**]
weeks.  She states that she went to a walk in clinic last week
because she thought she was getting a pneumonia and was
diagnosed with "upper respiratory tract infection" for which she
was given "erythromycin" (?azithromycin).  She has no sick
contacts and denies fever or chills at home.

She was diagnosed with melanoma in [**2104**] and was found to have
brain metastases in [**2113**].  She was recently started on Zelboraf
in [**3-/2114**] for her metastatic melanoma.  She had previously been
enrolled in clinical trials before she was started on this new
medication, but was not improving.  In [**2113**], she was noted to
have brain metastases which was assoicated with right hand
weakness.  This was managed with whole brain radiation,
CyberKnife and dexamethasone for the edema which she is still
being tapered off of.  Her MRI on [**2114-5-7**] showed numerous
bilateral metastases in the brain with interval improvement
after the above treatment.

In the ED, initial VS were: 98.4 73 150/60 20 100%.  Sodium was
noted to be 117.  She had a CXR with concern for RLL infiltrate
and she was started on Levofloxacin.

On arrival to the MICU, the patient was feeling tired and weak,
but was unchanged from the past day or two.  She denied any pain
and complained of only mild nausea.

ONCOLOGIC HISTORY:
[**2104**], wide local excision of melanoma on the right thigh with
lymph examination
[**5-/2111**], recurrent nodule at previous site.
[**2112-4-5**], new lesion melanoma positive, status post wide local
excision, sentinel lymph node biopsy with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 519**] negative.
[**2112-7-19**], status post external beam radiation to right thigh.
[**2112-11-9**], excision of lesion on right arm and new lesion on
right thigh.
[**2113-3-27**], cycle 1, day 1 of protocol 10-056 part C monotherapy
on GSK.
[**2113-11-6**], nodule adjacent to the spleen consistent with
metastasis.  By protocol, patients on monotherapy are able to
cross over to receive both GSK [**Telephone/Fax (1) 85556**] and GSK [**Telephone/Fax (1) 85557**] at the
first sign of progressive disease.
[**2113-12-27**], CT scan significant interval increase in the left
upper quadrant soft tissue nodule, highly suggestive of
metastatic focus interval stability of previously described
nodules in the left breast and right proximal thigh interval
increase in hypervascular nodule in the inferior aspect of the
right breast.  Interval decrease in the size of the left
anterior
superior chest wall nodule, right axillary nodule, right lower
lobe pulmonary nodule.
[**2114-1-2**], discontinued protocol 10-056 for progression.
[**2114-2-6**], brain MRI.  New multiple nodular enhancing lesions
distributed in both cerebellar hemispheres and right cerebellum,
the largest a left parietal lesion 3 x 2.2 cm associated with
the
vasogenic edema, but no evidence of midline shift.  [**2114-2-7**], CT
torso metastatic melanoma unchanged within the left breast and
anterior spleen increasing nodules within the right breast and
lateral right shoulder.
