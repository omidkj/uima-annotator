CC: dyspnea.

History of Present Illness:
HPI: Ms. [**Known lastname 1007**] is a 73-year-old woman with a history of chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease on home O2 (4L @ night, 2L in the
AM) since [**2205-7-11**], diastolic hf (ef>55%), atrialf
fibrillation, history of stroke, HTN, and CAD s/p MI in [**2175**]'s
presenting with shortness of breath since last night.

The patient was in her normal state of health and had recently
been seen on [**12-16**] in her pulmonologists office for evaluation.
She states she woke up in the middle of the night to use the
bathroom, used her wheel chair to get to the bathroom, and
developed shortness of breath on route.  By the time she made it
back to her bed, her SOB had resolved.  She awoke the next
morning "panting", but made it to breafkast at her [**Hospital 4382**] facility.  She mentioned feeling generally uncomfortable
throughout the meal, without any focal chest pain or profound
SOB.  After breakfast she went back to her room to take a nap,
and woke up to use the bathroom again around 9:30 AM.  She
reports her SOB with minimal exertion in her wheel chair was
"Out of control" and prompted her to call 911.  She denies any
history of PND, but asserts 2 pillow orthopnea.  Denies leg
swelling, recent travel/long trips, or sick contacts.  She
reports having a mild dry cough for the last 2-3 days wihtout
any sputum production.  Deneis fevers, chills, nausea, vomiting,
diarrhea, palpiations, dizziness, or syncopal episodes.
.
Initially in the emergency room vitals were T=98.1, HR:74, BP
138/87, RR 26, and 92% on 4L NC.  Desaturations noted on NC to
85%. Placed on 10 L NRB with sats climbing to about 94%.  Exam
in the ED was notable for wheezes throughout with crackles at
the bases.  A bedside US was performed which showed no effusion,
and CXR was consistent with b/l pulmonary edema.  EKG showed
aflutter without RVR, and no ischemic changes.  BNP  was 1831,
and CE's were negative x1.  Labs were also notable for lactate
of 2.3.  Repeat Potassium was 4.0 presumably after nebulizer
treatments.   Patient was given 60 mg IV Lasix, 125 IV
Solumedrol, Combivent nebs, and 750 mg levofloxacin for
presumptive pneumonia.
.
Vitals at time of admission were 98.5, 82, 143/74, 24-28, 91% on
the non-rebreather. Patient with peripheral lines for
intravenous access, noted to be a hard stick.
.
Upon admission to the floor, the patient generally feels [**Doctor Last Name **].
Denies any chest pain, profound SOB, or discomfort.  She
continues to require 10L face mask to sat at 96%.

.
EKG ([**2205-12-17**]): Atrial fibrillation with diffuse ST-T wave
abnormalities are non-specific. The QTc interval appears
prolonged but it is difficult to measure. Since the previous
tracing of [**2205-8-24**] ventricular rate is slower and further ST-T
wave changes are present.
.
CXR ([**2205-12-17**]): Diffuse hazy opacity with pulmonary vascular
indistinctness and left pleural effusion likely bilateral, most
consistent with volume overload and congestive failure. If
indicated, consider repeat radiography after appropriate
diuresis to assess for underlying infection.

Interval Results:
.
CTA Chest With and Without Contrast ([**2205-12-17**]):Right upper lobe
ground-glass opacity which is stable since [**2203-8-5**], merits a
12-month followup to assess for stability.


Brief Hospital Course:
A/P:  Ms. [**Known lastname 1007**] is a 73 yo female with multiple medical issues
including pmhx of primary CNS lymphoma, diastolic HF, cad s/p
MI, afib, hx of stroke, OSA and COPD on home oxygen p/w
shortness of breath for the last 24 hours.
.
#  Shortness of breath:  Patient's presentation was perplexing
for pulmonary cause vs. cardiovascular cause.  While patient
carries a history of COPD, recent pulmonary function tests were
s/o restrictive lung disease, with FEV1/FVC>95%.  DLCO <35% as
well, s/o interstitial lung disease, severe CHF, emphysmea, or
PE.  Given hypoxia refractory to nebulzier treatments, BNP>1800,
and CXR that shows effusions and mild vascular congestion,
pulmonary congestion thought to be contributing to SOB.
Negative for ACS, and did not have infectious presentation.  Did
receive 1 dose of levaquin in ED prior to ICU presentation, but
did not continue in ICU.  Did not initially receive CT as hard
IV access.  Received supplemental oxygen requing 10 L venturi
mask to saturate in the low 90's.  Received 40 mg IV lasix in ED
prior to MICU presentation with diuresis of about 800cc's over
24 hours.  Placed on CPAP o/n as hist
