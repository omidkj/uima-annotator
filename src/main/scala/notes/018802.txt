History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 76 year old male with known severe aortic
stenosis. Over the past few months, he has complained of
progressive dyspnea on exertion. He subsequently underwent

[**2117-3-13**] Echocardiogram:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The estimated right atrial
pressure is 0-5 mmHg. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic
function (LVEF>55%). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an
increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
ascending aorta is mildly dilated. There are complex (>4mm,
non-mobile) atheroma in the ascending aorta beginning at 4cm
above the aortic valve (clip #[**Clip Number (Radiology) **]). The aortic valve leaflets are
severely thickened/deformed. There is severe aortic valve
stenosis (area <0.8cm2). No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral
valve prolapse. Mild to moderate ([**12-25**]+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be
determined. There is no pericardial effusion.
[**2117-3-14**] Chest CT Scan:
1. Diffuse atherosclerotic calcifications as above.  2. Patchy
bilateral predominantly peribronchiolar nodules likely represent
chronic bronchiolitis from infection such as MAC or
hypersensitivity  pneumonitis with likely reactive
lymphadenopathy. Imaging in three months can be obtained after
therapy as clinically indicated. 3. Compression fractures at L1
and L2 are of indeterminate age.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to the cardiac surgical service and
underwent routine preoperative evaluation. Given his critical
anatomy, intravenous Heparin was initiated. Workup included an
echocardiogram which confirmed severe aortic stenosis, and also
showed mild to moderate mitral regurgitation and normal left
ventricular function. Echocardiogram was also notable for a
dilated ascending aorta with plaque for which chest CT scan was
obtained. The CT scan showed that the aorta was normal in course
and caliber. There were moderate atherosclerotic calcifications
throughout the aorta without evidence of dissection or
penetrating ulcer. Preoperative course was otherwise uneventful.
He remained pain free on intravenous therapy and was cleared for
surgery. Given his inpatient stay was greater than 24 hours
prior to surgery, Vancomycin was utilized for perioperative
antibiotic coverage.

On [**3-15**] rd, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 914**] performed an aortic valve
replacement and coronary artery bypass grafting. For surgical
details, please see operative note. Following the operation, he
was brought to the CV ICU for invasive monitoring. Initially
hypotensive and anemic, he required inotropic support with
Levophed and vasopressin. Several units of packed red blood
cells were transfused. Over the next 24 hours, hemodynamics
improved and hematocrit stabilized. Pressors were weaned, he
remained stable, was weaned from the ventilator and was
extubated.

He was transferred to the floor on POD3. Beta blockers were
resumed, diuresis was continued along with aggressive pulmonary
care and bronchodilators. PT worked with him for strength and
mobility. He has baseline mobility issues, using a walker due to
instability from his spinal stenosis.  There was some erythema
of the sternal wound and Keflex was given empirically.

Diuretics were changed to oral formulations at discharge.  His
CXR demonstrated some intravascular fullness, but was
essentially clear.  He denies SOB, despite his wheezing.

 He developed atrial fibrillation for which Amiodarone was begun
and Lopressor was adjusted with rate control.. Anticoagulation
was begun with Coumadin for this as well.  He progressed
satisfactorily and was ready for rehabilitation.

Diuretics were continued after transfer and will continue until
he reaches his preoperative weight, about 72 kg.  The Atrovent
was changed to a more selective preparation given the severity
of his pulmonary disease.

Discharge precautions, medications and follow up instructions
were noted in the transfer paperwork and summary.
