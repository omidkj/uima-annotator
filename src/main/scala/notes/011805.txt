[**2155-6-5**] CT Scan
Fluid filled and dilated appendix measuring up to 1.3 cm with
adjacent fat stranding consistent with uncomplicated
appendicitis.

[**2155-6-8**] CXR
IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary process - stable.

[**2155-6-9**] Echo
The left atrium is normal in size. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and
regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic root is
mildly dilated at the sinus level. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no
aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve appears structurally
normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is no mitral
valve prolapse. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure
is normal. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Normal global and regional biventricular systolic
function. No diastolic dysfunction, pulmonary hypertension or
significant valvular disease seen.

Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable
for review) of [**2152-1-20**], the degree of LVH and aortic
dilatation may be slightly reduced on the current study.

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient admitted on [**2155-6-5**] with abdominal pain. CT scan

afib. He was given two additional doses of beta blocker with
resulting hypotension. Patient was transferred to the intensive
care unit. He was monitored and enzymes checked times 3. They
were all negative. Cardiology was consulted. Cardiology
recommends beta blocker, full dose asa, 1/2 dose of valsartan.
