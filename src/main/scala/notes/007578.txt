CT Head [**2147-4-28**]

IMPRESSION: Left frontotemporal scalp hematoma and left
basioccipital
fractures as described above. No intracranial hemorrhage seen.

NOTE ADDED IN ATTENDING REVIEW: There is relatively ill-defined
hyperattenuating material in several cortical sulci of both
cerebral
hemispheres, raising the possiblity of post-traumatic
subarachnoid hemorrhage.
However, there is also hyperdensity of the falx and tentorium,
diffusely,as well as some enhancement of the dural venous
sinuses, and this likely represents contrast enhancement,
related to IV contrast given for [**Hospital **] Hosp.
CECT performed some 2.25 hrs earlier; of note, this appearance
was not present on the original [**Hospital **] Hosp. NECT, done at
22.40h.

A follow-up CT should be performed, when feasible, to further
exclude the
possiblity of SAH.

CTA Neck [**2147-4-28**]
IMPRESSION:
1. Contained rupture of the aortic arch arising just distal to
the origin of the left subclavian artery with slight enlargement
of pseudoaneurysm sac compared to outside hospital study
performed two-and-half hours prior. Large associated mediastinal
hematoma, with blood tracking along in the descending aorta,
into the pericardium, along the left pleural space, and up into
the left neck and subclavian region.

Repeat head CT scan [**2147-4-30**]
IMPRESSION:

1. Worsening generalized brain edema, and new bifrontal
hypodensities, most consistent with evolving traumatic
contusions. Equivocal hemorrhage within the right frontal
contusion.

2. Small foci of right frontal and parietal subarachnoid
hemorrhage. Small
posterior parafalcine subdural hemorrhage.

3. Possible left distal cervical internal carotid artery
dissection. When
clinically appropriate, further evaluation with MRI, including
fat saturated T1-weighted axial images is recommended for
further evaluation.

4. Unchanged right orbital fracture.

CTA HEAD W&W/O C & RECONS; CTA NECK W&W/OC & RECONS   [**2147-5-1**]
 IMPRESSION:
1. Segmental area of dissection involving the distal cervical
segment of the left internal carotid artery (beginning at the
C1/C2 level) extending to the petrous/lacerum segment with no
significant narrowing and continued patency of this vessel and
more distal. Recommend confirmation with MRA neck including fat
saturated images when the patient is stable.
2. Non-visualization of the proximal portion of the left
subclavian artery
which may represent occlusion versus thrombus.
3. Reticulation of the superior mediastinal fat as well as a
left pleural
effusion which may represent a hemorrhagic pleural effusion.
Given the recent surgery, this can be post-surgical; however,
exclusion of a possible vessel injury that is bleeding should be
excluded.
4. Interval development of hemorrhage within the left frontal
non-hemorrhagic contusion. Questionable left parietal
hemorrhagic contusion versus artifact.
5. Stable subarachnoid hemorrhage and right anterior frontal and
lateral
frontal subdural hemorrhages.
6. Asymmetric, left greater than right, space between the
odontoid and the C1 arch with an associated left basioccipital
fracture.

RIGHT HUMERUS, TWO VIEWS.

There is a comminuted fracture of the distal diaphysis of the
right humerus, with medial apex angulation and slight
overriding. There is a large butterfly fragment laterally.
Overlying splint and leads present. No obvious radiopaque
foreign body. Assessment of the shoulder and elbow is limited on
these views. The possibility of some diastasis of the ulnar
trochlear articulation is strongly suggested. Further evaluation
of the elbow, by radiograph or CT when the patient is clinically
able is recommended.








Brief Hospital Course:
He was admitted to the Trauma service. Vascular surgery was
consulted because of the aortic transection for which he
underwent arteriogram and placement of a stent. There were no
complications. Orthopedics was also consulted and he underwent
open reduction, internal fixation distal radius three-part
fracture, open reduction internal fixation radial shaft
fracture, closed reduction and manipulation of right humeral
shaft fracture and splinting. Postoperatively he was taken to
the Trauma ICU where he remained sedated and vented for several
days.

He was eventually extubated and noted with mental status
changes. A Neurosurgery consult was obtained, no acute
neurosurgical issues were identified; it was recommended to
obtain a Neurology consult because of concern for possible
stroke. Of note new hypodensities consistent with traumatic
contusions were noted on CT imaging of his head that were not
noted previously. Because he would not be able to cooperate with
an MRI a CTA of head and neck to further assess anatomic
delineation was recommended. A baby ASA was also recommended for
prophylaxis.

Over the course of the next several days after being transferred
to the regular nursing unit his mental status began to improve
significantly. He was more alert and oriented, was tolerating a
regular diet and began working with Physical and Occupational
therapy. He did have intermittent complaints of headaches and
was given Fioricet for which he reported was somewhat helpful;
Oxycodone prn was also added to his regimen for the pain he was
experiencing from his other injuries. He progressed rather
quickly after this point and was recommended discharge to home
with services.

Social work was consulted for patient and family support.

He was discharged to home on hospital day 8 with specific
instructions for follow up.
