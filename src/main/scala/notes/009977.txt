Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Ampicillin / Ceftriaxone / Vancomycin / Aztreonam

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5129**]
Chief Complaint:
fever

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
76 yo male with a history of asthma, gout, BPH, CRF (baseline
Cr: 1.5-2.0) with two recent hospitalizations for pan-sensitive
enterococcus complicated by AV endocarditis with resultant
cerebral septic infarcts and a epidural abscess. On the day of
admission, the patient had a fever of 101.1 at rehab. Since the
patient has a history of infection (currently on daptomycin),
the patient was sent to the hospital. On presentation to the
emergency room, the patient had vitals signs of T: 99.9, BP:
149/79, HR: 86, RR: 16, O2 saturation: 100% room air. In the ED,
his NG tube was noted to be coiled in his mouth. Per the nursing
care at [**Hospital1 **], the patient was receiving tubefeeds. The
patient can answer questions "yes or no," which seems to be his
new baseline. Per his daughter, he has some better days.
.
The patient is unable to give a clear history due to altered
mental status.
.
The patient was originally admitted [**Date range (1) 71686**] with 6 weeks of
fevers and back pain. The patient was found to have bacteremia
from pan-sensitive enterococcus with complications including
aortic valve endocarditis and resultant septic emboli to the
brain and spinal epidural abscess. The route of enterococcal
infection remains unclear, though there was mention of a
transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) vs. prostate
biopsy being the possible source of infection. The patient
underwent a L5 laminectomy and S1 laminectomy and epidural
abscess evacuation on [**9-30**]. The patient had altered mental
status and tremors. Neurology evaluated the patient and thought
his tremors were likely a result of his bacteremia and possible
CNS infection (LP not recommended).
.
The patient was readmitted from rehab and stayed in the hospital
from [**Date range (1) 71687**] with continued fevers and lethargy. During this
hospitalization, the patient had an aspiration event with a
brief period of hypotension and respiratory distress that
required intubation. Over the course of his hospitalizations,
the patient's treatment has been complicated by allergies to
antibiotics including ampicillin, ceftriaxone, vancomycin and
aztreonam. The severity of these reactions remains unclear. Upon
discharge from his last hospitalization, the patient was started
on daptomycin with a course to last until [**11-14**].

Rhythm is probably sinus but baseline artifact makes assessment
difficult.
Consider left ventricular hypertrophy by voltage. Delayed R wave
progression
with late precordial QRS transition is non-specific. Modest ST-T
wave changes
are suggested but baseline artifact makes assessment difficult.
Since the
previous tracing of [**2146-10-28**] there is probably no significant
change but
baseline artifact in the limb leads makes comparison difficult.
