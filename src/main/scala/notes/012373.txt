Brief Hospital Course:
The patient underwent a CT scan that shwoed evidence of a
perforated small intestine which was the suspected source of his
sepsis.  He was intubated in emergency department in the setting
of aggressive volume resuscitation before entire clinical
picture was clear.  He was also started on vasopressors for
blood pressure support inthe setting of hypovolemic shock
secondary to sepsis.  The patient was seen by surgery for
consideration of an operative solution for his sepsis and bowel
perforation.  However, the patient's family did not want him to
undergo surgery.  After multiple family meetings in the
intensive care unit, the family and health care providers agreed
to extubate the patient and make his goals of care comfort only.
 The vasopressors were discontinued at that time.  The patient
was transfered to the general medicine wards where he was
closely monitored for comfort on a morphine drip.  He died the
following morning ([**2116-9-23**]) at 8:55AM.  The patient's sister
and brother were called and both siblings agreed to an autopsy
as long as the organs were returned to the body for burial.
