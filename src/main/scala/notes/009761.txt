Had not been feeling well the day prior, "weak", slept all day.
Had a cough at night.  Denies fevers, chills, nausea, vomiting,

Brief Hospital Course:
80 year-old man with a history of severe cardiomyopathy with
LVEF 30% with hx. cardiac arrest, DDD pacer, ICD, and stent to
Cx. artery, chronic afib on anticoagulation, presenting with one
day history of lethargy, cough, and s/p mechanical fall without
trauma, found to be febrile and hypoxic in the emergency
department, concerning for early pneumonia.
.
1) Fever and hypoxia - history most consistent with a viral
pneumonia.  No definiative lobar, bacterial process.  Continued
levofloxacin emperically with improvement.
.
2) Leukopenia and thrombocytopenia (relative): Resolved.
.
3) Malaise, somnolence, anorexia - all likely due to infection,
viral vs. bacterial pneumonia.  Monitor, encourage PO intake.
.
4) Chronic Systolic Heart Failure due to CAD with hx. cardiac
arrest and mult conduction system abnormalities s/p pacer and
ICD: Ruled out MI.  Cont. ASA, Plavix.
.
5) Chronic Kidney Disease, stage III: C r at baseline, slight
elevation, but NOT acute renal failure (not up by 25%).
.
6) Dehydration, mild.  Hold lasix as above for now, gentle IVF
until taking adequate PO.
.
7) Atrial Fibrillation - rate controlled.  Continue toprol,
warfarin.
.
8) Sleep apnea on CPAP - asked wife to bring machine from home -
she will today.
.


Medications on Admission:
aspirin 325 mg daily, Plavix 75 mg
daily, Lasix 20 mg daily, lisinopril 5 mg daily, Toprol-XL 25 mg
