CHIEF COMPLAINT:
Shortness of breath.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 88-year-old female
with severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with an
FEV1 measured at 0.6 liters, on home oxygen, who was admitted
to the hospital for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
flare.  The patient has had recent multiple admissions over
the past nine months for similar symptoms, requiring
Intensive Care Unit stays.  The patient now presents
following several days of lethargy and upper respiratory
infection symptoms accompanied by increasing shortness of
breath and declining mental status to the point of somnolence
with respiratory rate of 40.  She was intubated in the field
and brought to the Emergency Department where initial
presenting gases were 7.24/119/161 with unknown ventilator
parameters.

She initially had a blood pressure of 99/48 with a pulse of
93 and then was noted to be hypotensive with pressure of
57/33 and a pulse of 63 and was given two liters of normal
saline, one amp of Narcan, 125 mg of Solu-Medrol, 1 gram of
ceftriaxone and started on a Dopamine 10 mcg/kg/minute drip
with an increase in her blood pressure to 78/43 and a pulse
of 83.

While in the Emergency Department, a left subclavian triple
lumen was placed, and a right radial arterial line.  When the
arterial line was placed, the blood pressure was noticed to
be 120/64 with a pulse of 88, and the dopamine was weaned off
in the next ten minutes.  A transthoracic echocardiogram at
the bedside showed normal left ventricular systolic function
and no effusion.  Chest x-ray showed emphysema and no
infiltrate.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Her past medical history is
significant for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with
FEV1 of 0.66 and FVC of 1.36, ratio measured 78 percent of
predicted.  She is on three liters of oxygen at home via
nasal cannula.  She has a history of colon cancer, Duke stage
A, status post low anterior resection in [**4-/2098**], status post
seizure in [**2097**] from hyponatremia, syndrome of inappropriate
diuretic hormone, osteoarthritis, lower back pain,
osteoporosis, old lacunar infarct in the right corona
radiata.  Transthoracic echocardiogram in [**9-/2102**] showed
ejection fraction of 60 percent with normal valves.

ALLERGIES:  The patient is allergic to doxycycline.

MEDICATIONS:  Her medications on admission were Serevent two
puffs b.i.d., Atrovent two puffs q.6 hours p.r.n., albuterol
two puffs p.r.n., regular insulin sliding scale, Tums t.i.d.,
Protonix 40 mg p.o. q.day, Klonopin 0.25 mg b.i.d.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives with her children.  She
has a history of smoking one pack per day for 20 years.  She
stopped 30 years ago.  She has no occupational exposures.
She is followed by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 216**].  Her pulmonologist is
Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 217**].

FAMILY HISTORY:  Family history is positive for tuberculosis
and lung cancer.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission, her vitals were
temperature 98.4, heart rate 104, blood pressure 100/68,
respiratory rate 18, saturating at 100 percent on ventilator
settings (unknown).  The patient was intubated and sedated
but arousible and moving all arms and legs on repositioning.
There was no evidence of jaundice.  Pupils were equal, round
approximately 2-3 mm and reactive to light but sluggish.
There was no nasal discharge.  Her heart had a regular rate
and rhythm.  Her lungs had wheezing in the left upper lobe
and scattered crackles in the bases bilaterally.

Her abdomen was nondistended.  Normoactive bowel sounds were
present.  There was a question of fullness in the abdomen.
Extremities were cool to touch.  There was no cyanosis,
clubbing.  There was 1+ pitting edema to the mid ankles.
Dorsalis pedis and posterior tibials were not appreciated.

LABORATORY DATA:  White blood cell count 8.8, hematocrit
39.4, platelets 247.  Sodium 132, potassium 5.2, chloride 87,
bicarbonate 39, BUN 15, creatinine 0.6, glucose 127.
Coagulations:  PT 11.2, PTT 27.6, INR 0.8.  Her repeat gas on
assist-control of 18 times 550 with 40 percent FiO2 was
7.46/55/150/40.  Ventilator settings were subsequently
changed to 16 times 500.

CK was 40.  Chest x-ray showed emphysematous changes in upper
lobes bilaterally, engorgement of pulmonary veins, arteries
at bases, question of pruning, flattened hemidiaphragms, left
subclavian in good position, endotracheal tube 5 cm from
carina.  Electrocardiogram was normal sinus rhythm at 71
beats per minute, normal axis, PR, QRS, QT intervals,
elevation of ST segment of 1 mm in leads II, III, F, and
V3-V4, not seen in previous tracing on [**2102-12-15**], peaked Ts
in leads [**5-13**], T wave inversion in aVL, notched P waves, poor
R wave progression in V1-V3.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the Intensive
Care Unit with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
exacerbation, hypercarbic respiratory failure, hypotension.

Shortly after the patient arrived to the floor, she was very
agitated, moving all extremities, following commands
intermittently, then noted to have a grand mal seizure with
coarse bucking body tremors, desaturation into the 60s, eyes
rolling back into the head.  Following this, the patient had
supraventricular tachycardia in the 190s which converted
without intervention during seizure activity.  The patient
was given 2 mg of Ativan, and the seizure then resolved.

Noncontrast head CT was completed which showed no extra-axial
collection, no mass effect, no shift, no acute hemorrhage,
old right caudate lacunar lesion, slightly more prominent
cerebral white matter with patchy hypodensity probably
relating to microvascular ischemic gliosis and infarction.
MRI of the head showed moderate changes of small vessel
disease, brain atrophy, no evidence of hydrocephalus or mass
effect, no evidence of abnormal enhancement, no evidence of
acute infarct.  Electroencephalogram showed mildly slow
background with burst of generalized data and delta slowing
with sharp features.  There were times of focal slowing in
the left hemisphere and left temporal lobe.

Neurology was consulted, and the patient was loaded with
Dilantin.  It was thought that the seizure was precipitated
by a rapid correction in her bicarbonate.  No further seizure
activity was noted during her hospital course.

The patient was started on empiric antibiotics of Levaquin
and ceftriaxone.  She was started on steroids with a rapid
taper.  She was extubated on [**2103-1-6**] with her gas after
extubation on three liters nasal cannula with an oxygen
saturation of 92 of 7.44/58/85.  The patient had recurrent
episode of hypotension with systolic low as the 80s and MAPs
in the 50s and was restarted on low-dose dopamine which was
then discontinued.

The patient was transferred to the floor on [**2103-1-8**].  She
continued to have a rapid respiratory rate as high as the 40s
but denied any complaints of shortness of breath.  Her oxygen
saturation was maintained between 88 and 92 percent, and her
oxygen requirement was weaned from three liters down to one
liter.  Pulmonary was consulted given the patient's repeated
intubations this year.  The recommendation was made for
follow-up pulmonary function test which revealed poor effort
but FEV1 of 0.65 which is 52 percent of predicted, and FVC of
0.74 which is 33 percent.  Arterial blood gases were
7.39/65/57.  Follow-up CT showed extensive emphysema with
bullae.  No infiltrate.  Mucous in the trachea.  Left pleural
effusion, small.  Marked hyperexpansion.  There was a
question of possible thrombus in the pulmonary vasculature.

The patient was started empirically on heparin infusion while
CTA was obtained which was negative for pulmonary embolus.
The patient's CT was concerning for numerous pulmonary
nodules which were coarsely calcified and consistent with
granulomatous infection.  She had two irregular nodular
densities in the right upper lobe which lacked calcification
and were associated with right hilar adenopathy.

A Speech and Swallow evaluation showed that the patient has
silent aspir
