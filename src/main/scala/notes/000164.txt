EKG [**8-27**]: complete heart block with junctional escape at [**Street Address(2) 74118**] elevations II, III, aVF, LAD, PRWP, PR
.
Cardiac Cath [**8-27**]
1.  Coronary angiography in this right dominant system
demonstrated
single vessel disease.  The LMCA and LCx had no angiographically

apparent flow limiting epicardial disease.  The LAD had minimal
disease.
The mid-RCA had an 80% lesion and mid/distal total occlusion.
2.  Resting hemodynamics revealed elevated right sided filling
pressures
with an RVEDP of 17 mmHg and PCWP = 16 mm Hg consistent with RV
infarct
physiology. There was moderate pulmonary systolic hypertension
with a
PASP of 46 mmHg.  There was mild systemic
arterial systolic hypertension with an SBP of 148 mmHg.
3. Successful stenting of the distal and mid RCA lesions with
2.5 X 28
mm Minivision and 3.0 X 16 mm Liberte bare metal stents with no
residual
stenosis (see PTCA comments for detail).
4. Successful treatment of inferior MI with thrombectomy and
primary
PTCA.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. One vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Acute inferior myocardial infarction, managed by acute export

thrombectomy and dilation and stenting of mid and distal RCA
lesions.
3. Moderate pulmonary artery hypertension and Right ventricular
dysfunction.
4. Mild systemic arterial hypertension.
5. Successful stenting of the distal and mid RCA with bare metal

stents.
.
TTE [**8-29**]
The left atrium is normal in size. There is moderate symmetric
left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. There is  mild regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction with focal akinesis of the  basal inferior and
inferolateral walls and hypokinesis of the basal to mid inferior
walls. The remaining segments contract normally (LVEF = 50 %).
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more
depressed given  the severity of valvular regurgitation.] The
right ventricular cavity is  mildly dilated. There is moderate
global right ventricular free wall  hypokinesis with apical
dyskinesis. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is
seen.  The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Severe
(4+) mitral  regurgitation is seen. There is borderline
pulmonary artery systolic  hypertension. There is no pericardial
effusion.
IMPRESSION: Regional left and right ventricular dysfunction
consistent with  inferior/inferolateral myocardial infarction
with right ventricular
involvement. Severe mitral regurgitation. Borderline elevated
pulmonary artery  systolic pressures.
.
CXR [**8-30**]:
IMPRESSION: No fluid overload or heart failure. No acute
cardiopulmonary disease.


Brief Hospital Course:
1. STEMI:
Symptoms started at roughly 8pm and pt arrived in the ED at
8:30pm. In the ED, her vitals were: Pulse 50, BP 99/65,
Respiratory Rate  22, O2 saturation  97% on 4L nasal canula.
Initial ECG showed ST elevations inferiorly and complete heart
block with a junctional escape. Pt was given asa, plavix 600mg
x1, heparin gtt, integrilin and transferred to the cath lab. At
cath, she was found to have a 80% mid total occlusion of the RCA
which was opened and treated with a bare metal stent. There was
no hemodynamic instability, though pacing was transiently
required during the cath for heart rate in 40s. The patient was
admitted to CCU for overnight monitoring, arriving in stable
condition with pulse in 90s BP 120/80. In the CCU, she had an
uneventful course with no further ischemic symptoms or evidence
of heart block, and was discharged on aspirin, clopidogrel,
atorvastatin, metoprolol, lasix, and lisinopril. She will follow
up her primary care physician and cardiologist upon her return
to [**State 5887**] in two weeks. Her lipid panel should be repeated
as an outpatient.
.
2. Mitral Regurgitation:
The patient's [**8-29**] echocardiogram was notable for severe (4+)
mitral regurgitation. She should have a cardiac MRI in [**3-31**] weeks
for further evaluation, with consideration for possible valve
repair.
.
3. Renal insufficiency:
Per the patient's primary care physician, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] last recorded
creatinine was 1.0 on 7/[**2149**]. Her creatinine was somewhat
elevated from this at 1.6 on admission, and trended back down
following rehydration. She will need a repeat creatinine and
potassium measurement as she has started an ACE inhibitor in
hospital.
.
4. Anemia:
The patient was found to have a normocytic anemia at admission
with hematocrit nadir of 23 in hospital, and consequently was
transfused 2 units of PRBCs She did not have any gross GI
bleeding, but did have some heme positive stools. She denies
ever having a colonoscopy. Her anemia should be worked up
further as an outpatient. Her iron studies, folate and B12
levels were normal when checked [**8-30**]. Chronic renal insufficiency
may be a contributing factor to her anemia, although low level
GI bleeding should be excluded.
