History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is an 80 y/o M with a PMH significant for recent
emergency repair of type A aortic dissection post-op course
complicated by pneumonia, A.fib on coumadin, occlusive left IJ
thrombus and nonocclusive thrombus of the left cephalic vein who
presented today to an OSH with BRBPR and RLQ abdominal pain.
This morning at his rehab facility was noted to have cranberry
colored stools per the nursing report, then continued to
complain of cramping abdominal pain, at that time his VS were:
97.6, 92, 74/43, 20, 93% on 2LNC and he was transferred to the
ER.  Initially at the OSH his HCT was 27 with an INR of 3.8, he
received 2 units PRBC's with a drop in his HCT to 21, so he was
started on his third unit of PRBC's, given 2units of FFP, 10mg
of vitamin K SQ at the OSH and 1800cc's of crystalloid and
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].

Images:
[**12-8**] HIDA scan: 1. Poor hepatic function with slow uptake of
from the blood and only a small amount of excretion. 2.
Gallbladder nonvisualization indeterminate for cholecystitis
given #1.
.
[**12-7**] RUQ U/S Sludge within the gallbladder but no specific signs
of
cholecystitis. No biliary dilatation seen. Patent portal vein.
.
[**12-7**] CXR As compared to the previous radiograph, there is
slightly improved transparency of the left lung bases,
presumably due to slight regression of the pre-existing left
pleural effusion. The right pleural effusion and the right focal
parenchymal opacities that preexisted are unchanged. There is
unchanged evidence of moderate cardiomegaly. No evidence of
pulmonary edema.
.
[**12-1**] CTA 1. Thrombus in upper SVC originates in brachiocephalic
veins surround PICC line. 6cm of SVC is patent from azygos
insertion to cavoatrial junction. 2. Similar configuration of
aortic dissection, incompletely imaged and better demonstrated
on Torso CT on [**2151-11-28**]. 3. Mild interval increase in
transverse diameter of descending thoracic aorta. 4. Similar
nonhemorrhagic mild-to-moderate bilateral pleural effusions and
adjacent atelectasis. 5. Persistent bilateral ground-glass
opacities, worse at the right lung base.
Diff Dg includes aspiration, infection, or atelectasis.

EGD
[**11-29**]:
Gastritis
Ulcer in the duodenal bulb (injection, endoclip)
Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum
.
[**12-2**]:
Ulcer in the duodenal bulb (thermal therapy, injection)
Otherwise normal EGD to second part of the duodenum


Brief Hospital Course:
On arrival to the [**Hospital1 18**] ER his initial VS were: 98.2, 124,
99/72, 22. Hi labs: HCT was 23.5, INR was 2.6, lactate of 3.1
and he was in process of receiving his third unit of blood. He
was seen by GI and thoracic surgery in consult.  NG lavage was
negative for blood, EKG showed A.fib at 119bpm, T-wave
inversion/flattening in lateral leads, poor R wave progression.

.
GI initially recommended CTA abdomen, but given elevated Cr and
recent dye load that he received at the referring hospital it
was instead decided to have patient undergo a tagged RBC scan to
look for source of bleeding with plans for colonoscopy.  He was
on a NRB for the duration of his stay in the ER.  In the ER he
was given 40mg of pantoprazole, his 4th unit of PRBC's was
started, he had a right groin cordis placed and an 18G PIV as
well.
.
He was admitted to the Medicine service and transferred to the
MICU. his  initial VS were: 119/65, 141, 28, 90% on 3LNC with a
poor pleth.  During his ICU course he received another unit of
pRBCs and underwent endoscopy with identification of a single
deeply cratered 1 cm ulcer in the duodenal bulb which was
injected and clipped x3.  His hematocrit remained stable after
the procedure with no further evidence of bleeding and
eventually was transferred to the floor. More so, during this
time upper extremity thromboses were evaluated and he was found
to have significant clot burden in the left ij, bilateral
subclavian, and more distal veins bilaterally. GI recommended
against anticoagulation given the nature of his bleed. Vascular
finally made the decision to not place a SVC filter. Given clot
burden in upper extremity they felt this would be impossible.
.
On the floor the patient was initially stable. Heme/Onc was
consulted to further evaluate the patient's blood clot burden.
On [**12-2**] on the general medical floor the patient was
found to have a 500cc stool of bright red blood. HCT prior to
bleed 27.5.  Blood pressure in the 90s and heart rate in the
130s. One unit of pRBCs was transfused. He was transferred back
to the MICU for further management.
.
In the ICU. Initially blood pressure with cuff on distal right
arm measured systolic of 110 and heart rate of 100 - 110.
Central line was placed. On [**11-29**] he underwent EGD, s/p epi and
clips. Hct originally stable but then he did bleed again and
underwent repeat EGD on [**12-2**] with duodenal bulb ulcer bleeding.
He required multiple blood transfusions with packed red cells
during his stay for his acute blood loss.
.
Given his continued bleeding the Acute Care surgery team was
consulted and it was decided that he should undergo operative
repair.  Discussions with family took place in order to reverse
DNR code status to full code for the operative/early
post-operative period and this was agreed upon.  On [**12-3**] he
underwent vagotomy and pyloroplasty for duodenal ulcer.  He
remained intubated and was transferred to the SICU post-op.  He
tolerated the procedure well. He was extubated on [**12-6**]. and home
meds were restarted. He was eventually transferred to the
regular nursing unit.
.
He is currently being treated with triple therapy for H. pylori
+ and this will continue for a total of 2 weeks.  RUQ u/s showed
no acute cholecystitis and no CBD dilatation and HIDA scan
showed minimal excretion poor uptake.  The hepatology service
was also consulted and followed along closely during his
hospital stay.
.
He was evaluated by Speech who deemed him to be a high
aspiration risk and is currently on a diet consisting of pureed
and nectar pre thickened liquids.
He is also receiving Vanc and Cefepime for an aspiration
pneumonia. He will require Vanco trough levels to be monitored
closely.
.
His most recent HCT on [**12-14**] was 29.3.
.
He was evaluated by Physical and Occupational therapy and is
being recommended for acute level rehab care.
