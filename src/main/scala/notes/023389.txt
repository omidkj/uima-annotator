Service:  [**Hospital Unit Name 196**]/CICU

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 64 year-old male with
a history of coronary artery disease, stemi in [**3-3**] requiring
stents times two and hypotension requiring intraaortic
balloon pump.  The patient was rehospitalized [**2101-4-9**] for
congestive heart failure and AICD placement secondary to
depressed ejection fraction and risk of sudden death.  At
that time polymorphic ventricular tachycardia was
detected/induced and the patient had a single chamber ICD placed.
He was evaluated for a BiV ICD, but his QRS was narrow and he
was felt unlikely to benefit. He was readmitted to [**Hospital3 9683**] on [**4-18**] with decompensated congestive heart failure,
found to have episode of atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter.
Cardiology saw the patient on [**4-29**] as the patient had reported
feeling his ICD fire. The patient was then transferred for
further evaluation of his ICD to [**Hospital1 188**].  He was also noted to be pacing at 40 beats per
minute with associated hypotension.  His systolic blood pressure
was in the 60s, baseline systolic blood pressure in the 80s.  The
patient states that when the ICD fired he was experiencing chest
discomfort and was given nitroglycerin and morphine.  On transfer
here the patient denies chest pain or shortness of breath.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives with his daughter.  [**Name (NI) **] is
a nonsmoker.  He quit 10 years ago and had a prior history of
one pack per day for unknown duration.  He denies alcohol
use. Former police officer.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Temperature 98.1.  Heart
rate 79.  Blood pressure 84/60.  Respiratory rate 18.  Oxygen
saturation 97% on room air.  In general, he is in no acute
distress.  His neck was supple and without JVD.  His chest
examination below one half of his right lung was notable for
bronchial breath sounds.  He had crackles bilaterally at the
bases.  Cardiovascular regular rate, 1/6 systolic ejection
murmur.  Abdomen active bowel sounds, mild distention, soft.
Extremities were thin without edema.  He had no evidence of
peripheral edema or sacral edema.  On admission he had old ST
elevations in leads V2 through V4 on his electrocardiogram.

LABORATORIES ON ADMISSION:  White blood cell count 8.0,
serial hematocrit 33, platelets 225, INR 1.6, PTT 23.5,
calcium 9.6, magnesium 1.9, phos 3.5.  Chem 7 sodium 135,
potassium 4.3, chloride 96, bicarb 29, BUN 35, creatinine 1.1
up from a baseline of .9 [**4-7**].

HOSPITAL COURSE:  This 64 year-old gentleman with complex
cardiac issues status post large anterior wall myocardial
infarction with residual severe ischemia, ejection fraction
of 20 to 25% status post left anterior descending coronary
artery stent/thrombectomy, subsequent mid circumflex and
distal right coronary artery PCIs with stent placement and
recent ICD/pacemaker placement for inducible polymorphic
ventricular tachycardia here with decompensated heart failure
now appearing euvolemic by examination and inappropriate ICD
firing per records at [**Hospital3 **].

1.  Cardiac:  Rhythm, the patient had ICD interrogation,
which showed appropriate firing of his ICD for ventricular
tachycardia/ventricular fibrillation.  The first event was
aborted appropriately and the patient was delivered one
appropriate shock appropriately.  All of the lead parameters
appeared normal.  The EP Service did not make any changes to
the ICD parameters.  They felt that the ventricular
tachycardia/ventricular fibrillation was likely secondary to
Dopamine, which the patient was on at the time for diuresis.

Pump, the patient also underwent cardiac catheterization,
which showed significantly elevated filling pressures, a mean
capillary wedge pressure of 37 mmHg and patent stents in the
left anterior descending coronary artery, left circumflex and
right coronary artery.  The patient was felt to be in severe
congestive heart failure and had a Swan Ganz catheter placed
and was transferred to the Cardiac Intensive Care Unit for
close observation.  In the Cardiac Intensive Care Unit the
patient was begun on Dobutamine in order to wean the Dopamine
for tailored diuresis.  In addition, the patient was diuresed
with Lasix.  The patient was slowly weaned off the Dopamine
and then the Dobutamine.  He diuresed extremely well in the
Cardiac Intensive Care Unit and was transferred back to the
General Medical Floor on [**2101-5-5**].  The patient continued
diuresis with Lasix and was transitioned to Lasix by mouth
prior to discharge 80 mg po q.d.  On discharge the patient
weighed approximately 70 kilograms.  This was felt to be his
dry weight.

Cardiac ischemia, in the cardiac catheterization laboratory
the catheterization revealed no restenosis of his stents.  He
was continued on aspirin, Plavix and a statin.  Prior to
discharge he was restarted on his Lisinopril as well as his
beta-blocker.

2.  Hematology:  The patient was on anticoagulation on
admission, which was initially held given concerns for
history of gastrointestinal bleeding.  It was clarified with
his primary care physician that the patient had
diverticulosis with gastrointestinal bleeds, but had been
stable on anticoagulation for months prior to admission.
There is also some question of the patient having HIT give
thrombocytopenia with prior heparin use, however, past HIT
antibody had been negative.  The HIT antibody was resent,
which was negative.  Hematology was consulted.  Hematology
felt that type 2 HIT, which was antibody mediated was
unlikely given the negative antibody test on two occasions.
They felt type 1 HIT would be more likely, but this was not
necessarily the clinical picture.  They felt that intraaortic
balloon pump likely contributed to the thrombocytopenia.  In
addition the second drop in his platelets seem to be
correlated with the 2B/3A inhibitor.  There also is a
possibility of post transfusion purpura as he had received 4
units of blood.  However, he did not have the profound
thrombocytopenia, which be associated with this.  Per
hematology recommendations the antiplatelet antibody,
indirect was sent, which will need to be followed up as an
outpatient.  The hematology team recommended that if the
patient needs heparin in the future, he should be monitored
very closely with at least daily platelet counts as he could
develop HIT type 2 with additional heparin exposure.  They
recommended that if his platelets fall again with exposure to
heparin that they would recheck the HIT antibody.

3.  Infectious disease:  The patient did develop a
superficial thrombophlebitis from a left intravenous
antecubital line.  He was started on Dicloxacillin for a
three day course to treat his superficial skin infection.  In
addition warm packs were applied to the area, which did
relieve the symptoms.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Stable.  The patient was ambulating
without difficulty.  He was at his baseline weight.  He
reported no dyspnea at rest.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  To home with services.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Congestive heart failure, systolic ejection fraction 10
to 20%.
2.  Cor
