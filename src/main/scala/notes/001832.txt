Radiology:
CXR [**2149-7-29**]: No acute cardiopulmonary process.

CT Abdomen & Pelvis [**2149-7-29**]:
1. No acute intra-abdominal process to explain the patient's
pain or clinical circumstance.
2. Unchanged to minimally increased periportal edema
3. Unchanged mild, irregular pancreatic ductal dilatation
compatible with provided history of chronic pancreatitis.

RUQ Ultrasound [**2149-7-30**]:
1. Coarse echotexture of the liver without distinct lesions.
2. Stable appearance of slightly prominent CBD, likely
post-surgical in
nature.
3. Normal appearance of the pancreas with prominent duct
measuring up to 4 mm
in maximum diameter, compatible with the patient's reported
history of chronic
pancreatitis.
EKG: Sinus tachycardia 123, no ST changes, similar to prior
except for tachycardia

MRCP [**2149-7-31**]:

1. Mild intrahepatic biliary dilatation with CBD dilatation
measuring 10 mm,
and mild pancreatic duct dilation, both stable when compared
with prior
imaging studies.

2. No peri-biliary enhancement to suggest cholangitis. No
evidence for
choledocholithiasis.


Brief Hospital Course:
45 year-old man presented with fever, RUQ pain, and hypotension
concerning for sepsis. BP normalized and stable after IV fluid
resuscitation, PICC removal, and broad-spectrum antibiotic
administration. Cultures have been no growth to date. AST/ALT
with transient elevation now downtrending. Hepatitis B and C
serologies were negative. Downtrending AST/ALT correlated with
patient's abdominal pain suddenly improving suggesting that
possibly he may have passed a gallstone from his bile duct.  RUQ
ultrasound was unrevealing.  Antibiotics were changed to cipro
and flagyl for treatment of cholangitis.  MRCP ordered to rule
out a retained gallstone.

PROBLEM LIST:
# Suspected cholangitis given fever, acute RUQ pain, transient
elevation in AST/ALT with sudden improvement in labs and
symptoms. Patient fully resuscitated with IV fluids, now stable
vital signs on antibiotics. All cultures no growth to date.  RUQ
ultrasound no stones, but MRCP ordered to better rule out
retained gallstones. Started ursodiol. No abnormalities seen on
MRCP. Vanco and Zosyn narrowed to Cipro and Flagyl for
cholangitis coverage. Blood cultures remained no growth to date
(from [**7-29**], [**7-30**]). PICC line removed, tip did not grow.

# Chronic pancreatitis: Has been on TPN for 2.5 months. Tried to
advance diet 2 weeks ago, but developed pain. No PO's for the
past week.
Gi team involved. Patient was started on clear liquids and diet
slowly advanced, which he tolerated without change in his pain.
Continued on home chronic pain meds (MS Contin 130mg q8h), did
receive some toradol and intermittent immediate release pain
med, Morphine IR 15mg po q6, which he reqiured 1-3 times per
day.

# Anemia, normocytic: Initial large HCT drop in ED in the
setting of 6L NS. HCT now back up, so likely dilutional. Iron
studies reveal iron deficiency. There is no frank blood per
rectum. [**Month (only) 116**] in part be due to acute illness.

# Thrombocytopenia: Unc
