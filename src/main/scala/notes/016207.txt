Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1711**]
Chief Complaint:
dyspnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac catheterization with 2 bare metal stents to right
coronary artery
Endotracheal Intubation
Foley Catheter
Right Femoral Triple Lumen Central Venous Catheter
Right Radial Arterial Line


History of Present Illness:
54 yo female with no significant past medical history presented
to OSH with progressive dyspnea. Per report collected from
husband, mother and [**Name (NI) **] nurse, the patient had symptoms of a URI,
ie dry cough, for about one week.  On the day of admission the
patient reported chest pain and dyspnea while driving home from
work.  EMS was called, and she was unable to speak in full
sentences.
.
Initial vitals on arrival to OSH 97.5 [**Telephone/Fax (3) 84559**]8 78% RA.
The patient had a CTA to rule out PE, which showed moderate
right and small left pleural effusions, diffuse ground-glass
densities, bibasilar consolidations.  PE, aortic dissection and
aneurysm were ruled out. Urinalysis, tox screen and LFTS were
normal.  At the OSH, her creatinine .9. BNP 2331 and troponin
.11. Pt was given 325mg ASA, NTG .4mg SLx3, lasix 40mg IV x2 and
put on BiPap. In short order, the pt was then intubated using
etomidate, vecc and succ and started on a nitro drip. Propofol
was used for sedation and a PEEP of 20 was noted. Pt
subsequently became hypotensive and was put on both levophed and
dobutamine drips. The patient was given ceftriaxone and azithro
for antibiotic coverage and a urine legionella was sent. A
central line was placed in the right femoral vein. The patient
was then transferred to [**Hospital1 **] for further management.
.
In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, initial vitals, 98.8 92 105/82 28 100% on FiO2
100% Peep 20 RR 25set. Pressors were discontinued. EKG showed
sinus rhythm no signs of ischemia noted. Cardiology consulted
who initially recommended conservative management with repeat
enzymes and felt trop bump likely related to demand. CXR showed
bilateral process. Pt given vanc in addition to azithro and
ceftriaxone, and 4L IVFs. Pt was switched from propofol to
fentanyl/versed. A limited ultrasound was performed that did not
show any free fluid in the abdomen or pericardial effusion. Pt
also received 40meq KCL IV x1. Pt was also noted to be trace
guaiac positive.
.
The patient was admitted to the MICU initially.  Her vitals on
arrival were 100 88 148/91 28 100% FiO2 80%, Peep 16. Repeat EKG
showed T wave inversion in I and aVL. Cardiology [**Name (NI) 653**], EKGs
faxed, felt to be unchanged.  A TTE showed mod LVH, normal
cavity size, probable mild regional LV systolic dysfunction with
EF 55-60%, and basal inferior hypokinesis.  The patient was
taken to the cath lab and was found to have 3 vessel disease
with diffusely diseased LAD, OM stenosis and RCA stenosis.  Two
baremetal stents were placed in the RCA, and the other lesions
were unable to be intervened upon.  The patient was transferred
to the CCU for management of her coronary artery disease.  The
patient was ruled out for flu.
.
Unable to obtain a review of symptoms secondary to sedation and
intubation.

EKG - NSR, TWIs I and aVL, suggestion of ST depression in

TELEMETRY:  Normal sinus rhythm at a rate of 70bpm
.
2D-ECHOCARDIOGRAM:  Suboptimal image quality. The left atrium is
normal in size. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color
Doppler. There is moderate symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. There
is probably mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction
with basal inferior hypokinesis. No masses or thrombi are seen
in the left ventricle. Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an
increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). There
is no ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size
and free wall motion are normal. The diameters of aorta at the
sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. An eccentric jet of at least mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is a small pericardial effusion.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.

ETT:  none
