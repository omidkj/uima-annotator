Allergies:
Penicillins

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 443**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
coronary angioplasty x 2
Bare metal stent to LAD x 2

History of Present Illness:
58 yo M with a history of asthma and seasonal allergies who
presents with chest pain, found to have STEMI with 90% LAD
lesion successfully stented complicated by right femoral
hematoma.
.
The patient states that at around 8PM after dinner on the day
prior to admission he developed nausea and emesis x3. This was
followed by 7 out of 10 nonradiating substernal chest pain. The
patient presented to an OSH where he was found to have likely
STEMI with ST elevations in I, aVL, V1-3 with Q's in V1-[**Street Address(2) 23394**]
depressions in II, III, aVF, V5-[**Street Address(2) 77527**] depressions
in aVR. The patient received aspirin, plavix, nitro and heparin.
He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] [**Location (un) 86**] cath lab where he was found
to have 90% hazy LAD lesion successfully stented with bare metal
stent. Procedure was notable for the development of a right
femoral hematoma. Angioseal was used for closure and pressure
was held for 30 minutes in the cath lab.
.
On review of symptoms, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
He denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other
review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of dyspnea on
exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema,
palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

[**2175-3-4**] Cardiac Catheterization:
1.  Coronary angiography of this right dominant system revealed
single
vessel coronary artery disease.  The LMCA, LCx, and RCA were all
without
angiographically evident flow limiting stenosis.  The proximal
LAD had a
90% hazy thrombotic lesion.
2.  Resting hemodynamics revaled aortic systolic pressure of 101
mm Hg.
3.  Left ventriculography was not performed.
4. Successful stenting of the proximal LAD with a 3.0 x 18 mm
VISION
BMS. Final angiography revealed no residual stenosis, no
angiographically apparent dissection and TIMI III flow.
5. Right femoral arteriotomy site was closed with a 6 French
Angioseal
device.

[**2175-3-6**] Cardiac Catheterization:
1. Coronary angiography revealed stent thrombosis of proximal
LAD. LCX
had no significant disease. RCA was not examined.
2. Resting hemodynamics revealed a SBP of 137mmHg and DBP of
92mmHg.
3. Successful PCI/stent to proximal LAD (stent thrombosis) with
stent
placed at distal edge of previous stent. 3.0x12mm bare metal
stent
deployed and posted with 3.5mm NC balloon to 26atms. Excellent
result
with normal flow down vessel and no residual stenosis.

[**2175-3-4**] TTE:
The left atrium is normal in size. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is
moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
anterior, anteroseptal, apical, and distal inferior severe
hypokinesis/akinesis (LAD distribution). The remaining segments
contract normally (LVEF = 30%). No masses or thrombi are seen in
the left ventricle. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The aortic root is mildly dilated at the
sinus level. The ascending aorta is moderately dilated. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good
leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis. Trace aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears structurally
normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is no mitral
valve prolapse. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure
is normal. There is no pericardial effusion. IMPRESSION:
Moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction, c/w
CAD. Dilated thoracic aorta.

[**2175-3-4**] Femoral Ultrasound:
No evidence of right groin hematoma, pseudoaneurysm, or AV
fistula.

[**2175-3-6**] Abdominal/Pelvis CT:

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 77528**] was found to have a STEMI with 90% occlusion of the
LAD; a bare metal stent was placed.  The catheterization on
[**2175-3-4**] was complicated by development of a right femoral
hematoma.  Femoral US on [**2175-3-4**] showed no bleed, pseudoaneurysm
or AV fistula, and Hct remained stable.  He was placed on
aspirin 325 mg QD, plavix 75 mg QD and atorvastatin 80 mg QD;
Integrilin was continued for 18 hours after the catheterization.

On the morning of [**2175-3-6**], he developed chest pain with acute ST
segment changes on EKG.  He was taken to the cath lab and was
found to have stent thrombosis of the proximal LAD.  He
underwent successful restenting of the LAD.  Plavix was
increased to 150 mg PO daily and no further complications were
encountered.

Below is a problem based summary:

# Non-ST elevation MI: As above, Patient underwent successful
PTCA with BMS to LAD, complicated by right femoral hematoma and
subacute in stent thrombosis. Repeat PTCA with overlapping BMS
was performed. Patient tolerated both procedures well and was
able to ambulate with physical therapy. Patient will likely
require cardiac rehabilitation, will defer further management to
primary cardiologist.

#. Acute Systolic heart failure: After MI, TTE revealed LVEF =
30% and moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction
with anterior, anteroseptal, apical, and distal inferior severe
hypokinesis/akinesis (LAD distribution). Anticoagulation was
started to prevent ventricular wall thrombus formation. Patient
was started on beta blocker and ace inhibitor with good
toleration; for details please see medications section. Patient
may require repeat TTE as outpatient, defer to primary
cardiologist.

# Right groin hematoma. Significantly improved at time of
discharge.

# Asthma. No acute exacerbation during hospitalization, patient
maintained on home regimen of Albuterol PRN.

# FEN: Patient tolerated a cardiac diet

# Prophylaxis: Anticoagulated with Heparin

# Code: Patient remained Full Code during hospitalization.
