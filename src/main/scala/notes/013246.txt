CONCISE SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  Tracheobronchomalacia:
It is very likely that the patient's presenting symptoms are
secondary to plugging of the stents that the patient had
placed this year.  The patient was scheduled to go to the OR
for visualization and probable therapeutic procedure.  On

removal times 2.  Bronchial washes were sent for culture and
the patient was placed on levofloxacin and Flagyl for two
days; then was taken off her medication formulary since the
patient had continued to be afebrile with normal white cell
count.  Her symptoms improved postprocedure and remained
stable.  Long term plan, tracheoplasty.

supplementation.  Postprocedure, the patient had 100 percent
