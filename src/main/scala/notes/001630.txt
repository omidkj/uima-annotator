History of Present Illness:
Pt is a 68 Y M with Hx of HTN who is transferred from
[**Hospital3 **] with DVT, PE, and a new diagnosis of
APML.  History is obtained from the patient without the current
availability of all previous records.  On [**2104-1-25**], he
went to see his PCP for [**Name Initial (PRE) **] routine visit and because he had
conjunctivitis.  There he was found to have Hgb of 10 and WBC
2.2 whose values were the same a week later.  His PCP referred
him to a hematologist who sent him for a CXR because he had a
chronic, dry cough.  The CXR showed bilateral patchy infiltrate,
but he had a chest CT to characterize it further.  He was
started on Avelox for PNA, and referred to a pulmonologist.  His
pulmonologist noted peripheral eosinophilia and started him on a
course of prednisone 80mg PO daily x 3 days with a 20mg taper
every 3 days which ended about a week ago.  The prednisone
improved his breathing and dry cough somewhat.  Repeat CBC
approximately one week prior to admission showed WBC of 22K with
immature cells in the periphery. He underwent a BMBx and
afterwards complained of right leg pain and swelling.  His
pulmonologist referred him for LE ultrasound which showed a RLE
DVT; he was admitted to [**Hospital1 **] where CTPA also
revealed PE. He was started on IV heparin.  His BMBx and
peripheral flow cytometry returned which was consistent with
APML.  He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation.  On
arrival, he states that he has had fatigue, anorexia, insomnia,
and 25 lb weight loss for the past 1-2 months.  He also has a
mild global HA and RLE swelling and soreness but no other acute
concerns.

Portable TTE ([**2104-3-20**]) - Post STEMI
The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. The estimated right atrial pressure
is 5-10 mmHg. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The
left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve
leaflets are mildly thickened (?#). There is no aortic valve
stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is
no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Normal left ventricular cavity size and wall
thickness with preserved global and regional biventricular
systolic function. Mild tricuspid regurgitation. Mild pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension.

Portable TTE ([**2104-3-21**]) - Acute onset of pulmonary edema
Overall left ventricular systolic function is probably
moderately depressed (LVEF= 30-35 %). There is no ventricular
septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. No mitral regurgitation is seen. There is no
pericardial effusion.

Portable TTE ([**2104-3-22**]) - Hypotensive episode
The estimated right atrial pressure is 5-10 mmHg. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is moderately depressed (LVEF=
30-35 %) secondary to hypo- to akinesis of the mid-distal
anterior septum, apex, and distal lateral wall
(anterior/inferior walls not well visualized). Right ventricular
chamber size is normal. with ? focal hypokinesis of the apical
free wall (clip [**Clip Number (Radiology) **]). The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Moderate [2+]
tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is a trivial pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Poor image quality. Moderate regional and global
left ventricular systolic dysfunction. Possible focal
hypokinesis of the RV apex. Mild mitral regurgitation. Moderate
tricuspid regurgitation with mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension.
Compared with the prior study dated [**2104-3-21**] (images reviewed),
regional and global biventricular systolic function are similar.
Mitral regurgitation is slightly worse but still in the mild
range. Pulmonary pressures were measured but not reported on the
prior echo (also mildly elevated then).

Portable TTE ([**2104-3-26**]) - Persistently tachycardic
The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. Left
ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There
is moderate to severe regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction with hypokinesis of the anterior septum and anterior
walls, distal inferior wall, and apex. The remaining segments
contract normally (LVEF = 30-35%). No masses or thrombi are seen
in the left ventricle. Right ventricular chamber size and free
wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly
thickened (?#). No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral
regurgitation. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not
be determined. There is a very small pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Normal left ventricular cavity size with regional
systolic dysfunction c/w CAD (LAD distribution).  Compared with
the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2104-3-22**], left ventricular
systolic function is similar.
