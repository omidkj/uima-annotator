Pt. was taken down to angiography today but could not tolerate
the procedure d/t back pain she was given approx 5mg of iv
morphine throughout the day. At dialysis 3.5L were removed. On
the floor, she was found slumped over and unresponsive although
reportedly still breathing. A code blue was called. She was in
PEA arrest for approximately 3 minutes during which time she
received compression and bag ventilation. She did not receive
any medications. The family was present during the arrest and
the husband requested that resuscitation be held. Soon after
stopping CPR, a femoral pulse was detected and the pt. was
breathing spontaneously. She then awoke and was able to carry on
a conversation, falling asleep intermittently. A discussion was
held with the family regarding her code status and she was made
DNR/DNI (documented in the chart by micu attending). However,
she was transferred to the micu for close monitoring.
