Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 896**]
Chief Complaint:
scrotal pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
scrotal abscess I&D [**2114-7-26**]

History of Present Illness:
This is a 47 yo M with history of DM, MI (s/p BMS to RCA
[**12/2113**]), PE (on coumadin) who presented from [**Hospital **] Hospital
ER with with 1.5 weeks of increased left scrotal swelling and
pain at the base of the scrotum worse over the day prior to
presentation.  He has a 5-year history of 12 abscesses which
have drained spontaneously.  At [**Hospital1 **], he had a testicular
ultrasound with moderate bilateral scrotal swelling without
testicular abnormalities noted and then a CT scan that showed
scrotal cellulitis and a left scrotal abscess.  Labs were
notable for a leukocytosis to 15K and he was given Vancomycin,
Piperacillin-Tazobactam, and Clindamycin.  For INR of 12.2 he
received 5mg IV Vitamin K.  He was then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for
urgent urology evaluation.

Upon arrival to our ED, VS 96.5, 99, 116/81, 18, 95/4L. Labs
were significant for creatinine 1.2, calcium 7.9, lactate 1.3,
WBC 15.4 with N73.2, platelets 102. INR was 6.0. He was seem by
urology and noted to have the abscess draining through a tract
towards the left perirectal part of the left hemiscroton and I&D
done with 300 cc of "maroon,bloody, foul-smelling pus" which was
sent for culture. Urology felt this was more consistent with
abscess and not suggestive of Fournier's gangrene. There was
immediate pain relief with drainage of the abscess and the wound
was packed.  The patient's SBP's dropped to the 80s systolic on
two occasions while in the ED but improved to 100s after three
liters IVF.  Given his recent hypotension he was triaged to the
MICU for  sepsis.

On the floor, he denied recent fevers and endorsed scrotal pain.
He had mild dyspnea, which he has had previously and relates to
COPD.  No other significant complaints.

TTE [**7-26**]
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is small. Due to
suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality
cannot be fully excluded. Left ventricular systolic function is
hyperdynamic (EF = 75%). The right ventricular free wall is
hypertrophied. The right ventricular cavity is dilated with
depressed free wall contractility. There is abnormal systolic
septal motion/position consistent with right ventricular
pressure overload. The aortic root is mildly dilated at the
sinus level. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally
normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or
aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve appears structurally
normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is no mitral
valve prolapse. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There
is no pericardial effusion.
.
IMPRESSION: dilated, hypocontractile right ventricle with at
least moderate pulmonary hypertension; small, hyperdynamic left
ventricle
.
[**7-26**]
BILATERAL LOWER EXTREMITY ULTRASOUND:
No deep venous thrombosis involving the right or left lower
extremity.
.
[**7-26**] CXR:
FINDINGS: An ill-defined opacity at the left lung base, likely
atelectasis, could be related to a bulge to the left mediastinal
contour just inferior to the aortic knob could be a left hilar
or mediastinal mass or, less likely aneurysm of the descending
aorta. . No pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
.
[**7-26**] CTA:
1. Mild septal thickening predominantly in the lung apices,
consistent with
mild volume overload.
2. Scattered symmetric mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes
measuring up to 11
mm. Findings may be reactive secondary to mild pulmonary
vascular congestion; however, the differential is broad and
continues to include inflammatory and neoplastic etiologies.
Therefore, follow-up chest CT in three months is recommended to
evaluate for interval resolution.
3. Mild centrilobular emphysema, predominantly at
