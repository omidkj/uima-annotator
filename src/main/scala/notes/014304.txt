Admission Date: [**2140-5-26**]        Discharge Date: [**2140-5-30**]

Date of Birth:  [**2072-7-8**]        Sex:  F

Service:  MED


The patient was admitted to Intensive Care Unit on [**2140-5-27**],
and discharged from Intensive Care Unit on [**2140-5-30**], after
evaluation for retroperitoneal bleed in the setting of
supratherapeutic INR.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 57 year old female
with a history of atrial fibrillation, congestive heart
failure, coronary artery disease, now on Coumadin, initially
on [**2140-5-26**], to the Emergency Department, status post
mechanical fall.  Apparently while standing up from toilet,
she had lost her balance and fell on right knee and hip.  She
denies syncopal or preceding symptoms such as chest pain,
shortness of breath or lightheadedness.  No head trauma and
no loss of consciousness.  She was unable to get up on her
own and called the ambulance.  In the Emergency Department,
the patient received Percocet and Toradol for right knee and
hip pain and then subsequently had right hip and knee plain
films which were negative for any acute fractures.  The
patient was admitted to [**Hospital Ward Name 516**] Medicine for presumed
pain control, but was subsequently found to have a hematocrit
of 23.0 from baseline of 31.7 on [**2140-5-19**].  She was
subsequently found to be supratherapeutic on her Coumadin
with INR of 6.8.  Given her concern for trauma to her right
hip and potential of bleeding, she was sent to CT which
subsequently showed a large retroperitoneal hematoma 7.8 by
6.0 centimeters extending along the base of her psoas muscle
into her inguinal canal.  The patient was given subcutaneous
Vitamin K, two units fresh frozen plasma and seven unit of
packed red blood cells ordered.  Meanwhile, the patient had
pulled out peripheral access from the Emergency Department
and underwent a successful right internal jugular placement
via ultrasound guidance.  Surgery was also consulted and the
patient was sent to the Intensive Care Unit for further
evaluation.  At the time of transfer, the patient complains
of right hip/back pain but otherwise is asymptomatic in terms
of being lightheaded, shortness of breath or chest pain.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  History of coronary artery disease,
status post myocardial infarction, last catheterization [**2136**],
with a 68 percent left anterior descending coronary artery
lesion and totally occluded diagonal and 50 percent lesion in
obtuse marginal one, last stress in [**2136**], with multiple
perfusion defects.

Congestive heart failure, ejection fraction 20 percent on
[**1-31**], stress test.

Atrial fibrillation, status post cardioversion but now on
Coumadin.

Sick sinus syndrome, status post pacer/ICD.

Osteoarthritis.

Status post right hip prosthesis.

Hypercholesterolemia.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1. Aspirin 325 mg once daily.
2. Lipitor 10 mg once daily.
3. Metoprolol 12.5 mg twice a day.
4. Coumadin unclear to current dosage.
5. Univasc 7.5 mg once daily.
6. Lasix 40 mg once daily.
7. Zantac 150 mg once daily.
8. Isordil 10 mg three times a day.
9. Amiodarone 200 mg once daily.


SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives alone, retired, and denies
any tobacco or alcohol use.  She reports being quite
functional.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Noncontributory.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission to Intensive Care Unit,
vital signs revealed temperature current 99.4, pulse 54,
ventricular paced, blood pressure 112/66, oxygen saturation
94 percent on two liters.  In general, in acute distress.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat remarkable for pale
conjunctiva and dry mucous membranes.  Internal jugular lumen
in place with jugular venous pressure about seven
centimeters.  The lungs are clear anteriorly.  Her cardiac
examination is significant for regular rate and rhythm,
III/VI systolic ejection murmur at upper left sternal border.
Abdominal examination is obese, nontender, nondistended with
several small ecchymoses around the right flank.  Her
extremities are with faint distal pulses, but warm and good
capillary refill.  No edema.  She has a small ecchymosis on
her right posterior hip and over her right anterior knee
which is tender to palpation.

LABORATORY DATA:  White blood cell count 7.7, hematocrit 23.3
up from 20.7 but down from 30.7 from two weeks ago.  Platelet
count 244,000.  Coagulation studies are significant for INR
of 6.8.  Chemistries show sodium of 142, potassium 4.9,
chloride 105, bicarbonate 25, blood urea nitrogen 34,
creatinine 1.1, glucose 98.

Chest x-ray showed stable cardiomegaly without any
cardiopulmonary process but with right internal jugular
placed into the posterior right ventricle.  Electrocardiogram
shows evidence of ventricular paced and unchanged from prior
studies.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Retroperitoneal hematoma - The patient with
right retroperitoneal hematoma in the setting of mechanical
fall and supratherapeutic INR.  She was transferred to the
Intensive Care Unit for further evaluation.  During her
entire Intensive Care Unit course, she remained
hemodynamically stable. She received four units of packed red
blood cells and ultimately her hematocrit stabilized into the
low 30s.  She meanwhile had her anticoagulation reversed with
multiple units of fresh frozen plasma.  She subsequently also
received Vitamin K.  Surgery followed the patient as well.
By hospital day four, the patient was hemodynamically stable
and her hematocrit was also stable at this point.  For now,
she will be off anticoagulation and will have to revisit
issues of anticoagulation at a later date with her primary
care physician.

Cardiovascular - congestive heart failure - The patient was
mildly hypoxic in the setting of multiple units of packed red
blood cells.  She is being simply diuresed and now started on
her p.o. Lasix regimen now that her hematocrit is stabilized.
Similarly, her beta blockade and Amiodarone are on hold in
the setting of initial severe anemia.  They have also been
restarted.  The patient tolerated her anemia without any
chest pain or shortness of breath.  She had enzymes sent
which were negative for any ischemia.  As mentioned above,
she does have a history of atrial fibrillation with
cardiomyopathy and multiple risk factors for thromboembolic
disorders.  However, at this point, she also is a risk for
mechanical falls and worse bleeding with Coumadin.  At this
point, the team has decided to withhold anticoagulation for
the next several weeks to months.  The issue of whether she
should be reanticoagulated will be discussed further with her
primary care physician, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name (STitle) **].

Pulmonary - The patient was mildly hypoxic on two to three
liters nasal cannula but oxygen requirements are now improved
with diuresis and mobilization.

Mechanical fall - The patient's pains are well controlled
with p.o. Tylenol and Percocet.  She is being evaluated by
physical therapy.  Given her age, she is also at risk for
osteoporosis and has been started on Calcium and Vitamin D.

Renal - The patient's electrolytes and renal function
remained stable during her Medical Intensive Care Unit
course.  She is being gently diuresed and will have her p.o.
Lasix started as an outpatient.

Code Status - Her code status at this point remains full.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:  Retroperitoneal hematoma in the setting
of supratherapeutic INR and mechanical fall.
