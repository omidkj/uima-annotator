Service:  Medicine

HOSPITAL COURSE:

1.  End Stage Renal Disease - The patient upon admission had
evidence of longstanding medical renal disease with a
progressive decline in his renal function over the last three
years.  His renal disease was complicated by metabolic
acidosis with a bicarb of 10 on admission and anemia with a
hematocrit of 21 on admission and hyperphosphatemia.  However
the patient was able to make urine and balance his fluids at
the time of admission.

He initially did not require dialysis and was treated
medically with bicarbonates, transfusion and oral
administration for his acidosis as well as the use of
phosphate finders for his hyperphosphatemia.  However after
aggressive treatment with IV fluids and blood cell
transfusions the patient became volume overloaded and was
minimally responsive to Lasix administration.  At that time
Quinton catheter was placed and emergency infiltration with
fluid removal was instituted with good affect.  The patient
subsequently required hemodialysis to maintain adequate
electrolytes and fluid balances. He was transfused by a right
subclavian venous access catheter that was placed [**2181-2-5**].
Plans were initially made for a placement of AV fistula for
long term access. However this has been deferred until a
later date when the patient's other numerous issues are
resolved.

The patient will continue to receive phosphate finders for
his hyperphosphatemia and will follow up with primary
nephrologist, Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name (STitle) 805**]. He will receive dialysis at
a local facility while at rehab and eventually will receive
his outpatient dialysis at [**Location (un) 4265**] [**Location (un) 3678**]. An appointment
should be made for Mr. [**Name14 (STitle) 103769**] to see Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 805**] around
the time of his transfer home.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 18991**] office phone
number is [**Telephone/Fax (1) 3637**].

2.  Diabetes - The patient was hypoglycemic at the time of
admission presumably due to decreased renal metabolism of his
oral hypoglycemics.  He was taken off of these medications
and managed on regular insulin sliding scale during the rest
of his hospitalization.  We were unable to initiate standing
insulin dosing regimen due to the patient's wide fluctuations
most likely from metabolic abnormalities related to his
dialysis.  The patient should be initiated on the standing
insulin regimen as soon as his sugars are more regular.

3.  Anemia - The patient was hospitalized with a hematocrit
of 21.  He was guaiac negative from below and presumably this
was all due to his medical renal disease.  Iron studies were
checked and he had adequate iron stores so the patient was
initiated on regimen of 3000 units subcutaneous
Erythropoietin with each dialysis and iron supplementation
with dialysis. At the time of discharge the patient's
hematocrit was stable and rising slowly in the low to mid
30s.

4.  Coronary artery disease -  On the day of admission the
patient was noted having intermittent chest heaviness. He had
his cardiac enzymes monitored and began to rule in for non-ST
segment MI, with elevated CK but flat MB and Troponin as high
as 7. He was Heparinized initially but this appeared to have
caused abnormal bleeding with the development of a large,
left sided ileus and left retroperitoneal bleed.  Heparin was
stopped.  DDAVP and Esterase were given and the patient's
bleeding apparently stopped. He was transfused aggressively
to try to bring his hematocrit over 30 as we believe this
ischemia to be demand induced.

The patient did not have any recurrent episodes of chest
heaviness and his cardiac enzymes trended down subsequently.
Given the fact the patient has already  had bypass surgery
and because of his renal issues we were not inclined to take
the patient for cardiac catheterization and opted to treat
him as aggressively as we could medically with initiation and
upward titration of oral nitrites and increased doses of beta
blockers. The patient returned to aspirin therapy just prior
to his discharge once his anemia was resolved.  At the time
of discharge it was decided that the patient may benefit from
a stress test in approximately two months time.

5.  Urinary tract infection - The patient was found to have
an enterococcal UTI that was pan sensitive to antibiotics and
was treated with a five day course of Ampicillin.

6.  Hematuria - The patient had recurrent episodes of
hematuria throughout his hospital stay most likely secondary
to Foley trauma.  The patient did intermittently pass clots
and had bladder irrigation with a three way Foley. Prior to
discharge the patient had been on bladder irrigation for 48
hours for hematuria subsequent discontinuation of the Foley
and the patient had brief episode of a few, scant clots in
his urine but no further episodes.
