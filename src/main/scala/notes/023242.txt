CARDIOLOGY:
TTE ([**4-19**]):
Conclusions
The left atrium is elongated. Left ventricular wall thickness,
cavity size and regional/global systolic function are normal
(LVEF >55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally
normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve. The
mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral
regurgitation. No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral
valve. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is
normal. There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: No vegetations or clinically-significant regurgitant
valvular disease seen (good-quality study). Normal global and
regional biventricular systolic function. Ascites.
In presence of high clinical suspicion, absence of vegetations
on transthoracic echocardiogram does not exclude endocarditis.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2167-3-19**],
ascites is more prominent. The cardiac findings are similar.
.
RADIOLOGY:
CXR ([**4-6**]) - preop: IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary
process.
CXR ([**4-15**]): IMPRESSION: New right IJ line tip projects at the
cavoatrial junction. Low volumes with right basilar atelectasis.
No other significant change.
CXR ([**4-22**]):
Since [**2168-4-15**], right internal jugular catheter was removed
and
left-sided dual-lumen subclavian catheter was installed, ending
in the low
SVC. The Dobhoff tube tip is in the third duodenum in expected
position.
Lung volumes are persistently low. Left lower lobe opacity
increased, could be due to atelectasis. Note that the left
costophrenic angle was excluded. Right basilar opacity is
unchanged, likely atelectasis. There is no other change.
.
CXR ([**4-26**]):
FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**4-24**], allowing for
differences in technique, there is little interval change. Low
lung volumes persist.
Retrocardiac opacification is again seen as well as a probable
small right
pleural effusion. No evidence of acute focal pneumonia.
Monitoring and
support devices remain in place.
.
CXR ([**5-4**]):
REASON FOR EXAM: End-stage liver disease, fever. Quantified
pleural
effusions. Small bilateral pleural effusions are greater on the
left side. There is mild fluid overload. There are low lung
volumes. Cardiac size is top normal. Bibasilar atelectasis
greater on the left side have worsened. Nasogastric tube tip is
out of view below the diaphragm.
.
LENI ([**2168-5-11**]):  No left lower extremity DVT.

Brief Hospital Course:
57 year-old male with hepatitis C cirrhosis awaiting liver
transplant, HCC status-post RFA, originally admitted on [**2168-4-6**]
for umbilical hernia repair in the setting of ascites leakage,
transferred to the hepatorenal medicine service for management
post-surgery, with prolonged hospital course c/b MRSA
peritonitis leading to sepsis, s/p MICU stay, ATN s/p temporary
hemodialysis, as well as ? hospital-acquired PNA. Hospital
course was as follows.

1. ESLD:  Patient has HepC/HCC cirrhosis with multiple
complications in the past. Currently awaiting OLT. Admitted for
umbilical hernia repair because of as
