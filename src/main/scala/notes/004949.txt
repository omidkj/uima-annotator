Attending:[**Last Name (un) 11974**]
Chief Complaint:
ventricular tachycardia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
VT ablation

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is an 81y/o gentleman with Parkinson's Disease, CAD s/p
CABG, sCHF (LVEF 25%), AFib on coumadin, and AICD who presented
with hypotension, was found to be in VT, and is being
transferred to the CCU due to recurrent VT after ablation today.
.
Of note, he was recently admitted [**Date range (1) 15037**] for pacer firing, and
was started on Amiodarone 400mg daily.  Due to nausea and loose
stools, his dose was decreased to 200mg daily on [**3-7**].
.
Per [**Hospital1 1516**] admission note, on this admission he initially
presented from home yesterday ([**3-31**]) with a caregiver for low BP
(80/60) and elevated HR (140-145).  He had felt fatigued for the
past 1.5 days, with baseline level of dyspnea.  Somewhat
decreased PO intake.  In the ED, initial vitals were T 96.8, HR
144, BP 82/61, RR 18, and SpO2 100% on RA. He triggered for
tachycardia and initial EKG was concerning for VT at 145 bpm.
He was given NS 500 ml. CXR showed moderate cardiomegaly and
pulmonary edema.  Labs were significant for Hct 33.9 near recent
baseline, INR subtherapeutic at 1.6, Cr 1.2 near baseline,
largely unremarkable electrolytes, Digoxin 0.5, and Troponin
0.07 up from prior values 0.02-0.03.  EP was consulted and he
was pace terminated with ramp.  He was admitted to the [**Hospital1 1516**] EP
service for continued management.
.
In the EP lab, he was found to have various morphologies of VT
and underwent ablation.  After the procedure, he was found to be
unarousable even off sedation, with right-gaze.  Code Stroke was
called and he underwent CTA head/CT brain which did not suggest
acute process.
.
He had 4 episodes of VT after his ablation:
1) In CT scanner. ATP did not pace him out-->externally
defibrillated.
2) Outside CC3 elevator. Received Amio 150 bolus.-->externally
defibrillated again.
[No bed was available in the CCU so he was taken to EP lab
holding area in the meantime.]
3) EP lab holding area. Lidocaine 100 bolus given.
-->ATP-terminated.
4) EP lab holding area. Lidocaine drip started.-->defibrillated
with his device.
.
On arrival to the CCU, patient is intubated, sedated.  Is on a
Lidocaine drip; had been on low-dose Phenylephrine while in the
EP lab holding area but this was discontinued.

In ICU, pt was extubated on [**2194-4-2**] without complications.  He
weaned off of lidocaine and has remained out of vtach.  Since
extubation, pt has been experiencing some hypokinesia, and
confusion, likely secondary to parkinsons.  Neuro is following
and recommended continuing with home parkinsons meds.

Pt was also on heparin drip. restarted coumadin on [**2194-4-2**] and
INR is now 3.2.  Pt was also diuresed with IV lasix in ICU and
was net negative 1L during stay there.  This AM, his cr bumped
from 1.1 to 1.8, likely from overdiuresis.  Pt also has bicarb
of 17 this am with gap of 20.

On transfer, pt's vitals are stable 98.3, 80, 148/72, 18, 97%
2L.  Pt is oriented, but hypokinetic and hypophonic.

Relevant Imaging:

TTE [**2191-7-22**]:
Severely impaired left ventricular systolic function (25-30%)
with akinesis of the inferior and inferolateral walls. Mild to
moderate aortic regurgitation with mild aortic stenosis. Mild
mitral regurgitation. Moderate tricuspid regurgitation. Moderate
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. No obvious evidence of
endocarditis. If clinically indicated, a transesophageal echo
may better characterize valves and implantable cardiac
defibrillator leads for possible vegetations. Compared with the
