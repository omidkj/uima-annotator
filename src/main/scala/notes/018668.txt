History of Present Illness:
77F with COPD, significant smoking hx who was initially admitted
to [**Hospital6 18346**] last wednesday for RLE cellulits,
discharged home on Friday on a course of Augmentin.  Per the
family and OSH notes, patient had a new O2 requirement on
discharge of 2L NC.  Per her family, patient's cellulitis
improved but she began to act "wacky;" was saying strange
things, hallucinating, and was increasingly somnolent. She also
had decreased PO intake and activity, ? due to SOB. Presented to
her pcp's office today, and reportedly had an O2 sat in the 60s
(74-78 % on 2L), so was sent to the ED.

In the ED in [**Hospital1 6687**], initial VS were BP 167/110, HR 112, RR
28, SaO2 53% on RA, which increased to 94% on 4L. Initially, she
c/o nausea [**3-11**] Augmentin and was given zofran 4 mg IV.  She
became obtunded and minimally responsive; CXR reportedly showed
Pulm edema and ABP showed 7.19/113/52/42 and the patient was
intubated.  She was also given albuterol nebs and Lasix 60 IV,
Ativan 2 mg IV and Morphine 5 mg IV, and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].
During [**Location (un) **], was started on peripheral Dopamine at 10
mcg/kg/min (no vitals recorded).

.
In the ED, T 100.8, BP initially 130/56, HR initially 60s but
increased to 140s transiently per nursing report (although HRs
recorded only to max of 120s).  Consequently, patient was
changed from dopamine to levophed, and HR improved to 110s.
During this changed, BP reportedly dropped (again not recorded,
and patient bolused 2 liters).  She was given vanco/levo to
cover leg and pulm sources, 10 mg IV dexamenthazone and admitted
to the MICU for further management.

Social History:
Quit tobacco 16years ago, previously has approximately 80 pack
year smoking history.  No EtOH nor other illicits.  Formerly
worked in parking permit department at the police dept.  Has 9
children (7 daughters, 2 sons). Lives alone on [**Hospital1 6687**], part
of the year in Fla.

IMAGING:
ECHO [**10-8**]
The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is
unusually small. Regional left ventricular wall motion is
normal. Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic
(EF>75%). A mid-cavitary gradient is identified. There is no
ventricular septal defect. The right ventricular free wall is
hypertrophied. The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated
with normal free wall contractility. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) are mildly thickened. There is no valvular aortic stenosis.
The increased transaortic velocity is likely related to high
cardiac output. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is no mitral
valve prolapse. There is severe mitral annular calcification.
There is moderate functional mitral stenosis (mean gradient 12
mmHg) due to mitral annular calcification. Moderate (2+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity
of mitral regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.]
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is
moderate to severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There
is no pericardial effusion.

[**10-8**]
CTA-
IMPRESSION:
1. Moderate pulmonary edema with bilateral pleural effusions and
bibasilar
consolidations which could be compressive atelectasis in the
setting of
effusions. Superimposed infection is not excluded.

2. Mediastinal adenopathy, unchanged since the prior study. This
could also be related to cardiac decompensation/heart failure.
Alternatively, this could be reactive to a generalized
infectious process.

3. Coronary artery disease, evidence of pulmonary hypertension,
significant mitral annular calcifications are all unchanged.

4. Unchanged left hepatic lobe lesion could represent a cyst or
a hemangioma.

5. Suboptimally visualized previously seen left adrenal mass.
This could
represent an adenoma, however is incompletely imaged, As
indicated previously,
this should be further evaluated with an adrenal protocol CT or
an MRI.

The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

CXR [**10-20**]
IMPRESSION: Pulmonary anatomic detail in the lungs is obscured
by respiratory motion.
Chest configuration indicates substantial COPD. Moderate right
pleural
effusion unchanged since [**10-19**]. Left lower lobe opacification is probably atelectasis, but
pneumonia
cannot be excluded. Pulmonary vascular congestion is definitely
present, and
there may be mild pulmonary edema. Heart size top normal.
Tracheostomy tube
in standard placement. Feeding tube passes into the stomach and
out of view.
