Admission Date:  [**2117-10-2**]     Discharge Date:  [**2117-10-8**]

Date of Birth:   [**2062-1-21**]     Sex:  F

Service:  Medicine, [**Location (un) **] Firm

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  A 2-day to 3-day history of weakness,
malaise, nausea, vomiting, and blood mixed with stool.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 55-year-old
woman who; in summary, was at [**Hospital1 188**] on an inpatient basis from [**8-16**] through [**9-6**] of
[**2117**] with a diagnosis of lower gastrointestinal bleed and a
myocardial infarction.

During this hospitalization, Interventional Radiology formed
an embolization of the patient's colonic arteriovenous
malformations.  Cardiac catheterization done at this time
demonstrated 100% right coronary artery stenosis, but no
percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty or
intervention was feasible at that time.  Prior to this
admission, the patient had had a 6-month history of
guaiac-positive stools with chronic blood transfusions.

Regarding the current admission, the patient had been doing
well at home until two to three days prior to admission, when
she noted nausea, anorexia, diffuse abdominal pain,
lightheadedness, dizziness, and two to three stools per day
of mixed blood and stool.  The patient started having bright
red blood per rectum initially, which then progressed to
maroon-colored stools.  The patient reports intermittent
substernal chest pain relieved with sublingual nitroglycerin.
She states that the chest pain lasts minutes at a time.  She
denies emesis, fever, or chills.  The patient also had
started erythromycin orally for bilateral lower extremity
cellulitis one day prior to admission.

While in the Emergency Department, two 20-gauge peripheral
intravenous lines were placed, 1 unit of packed red blood
cells was infused, 1 liter of normal saline was administered,
and 1 g of Ancef was given.  The patient's systolic blood
pressures were consistently ranging from the 90s to the 100s,
except for one recorded blood pressure of 86/37.  During this
time, the patient was able to mentate, and she was not
actively short of breath or experiencing chest pain.  She was
subsequently transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit
for close followup.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient has a 70-pack-year to
100-pack-year smoking history.  She denies any use of
alcohol.  She lives with her husband in the [**Name (NI) 86**] area.

FAMILY HISTORY:  The patient's mother has type 2 diabetes.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:   On initial physical
examination in the Medical Intensive Care Unit, the patient
had a temperature of 97.9 degrees Fahrenheit, blood pressure
was 99/56, pulse was 80, respiratory rate was 19, and her
oxygen saturation was 100% on 2 liters nasal cannula.  Her
weight was 93.3 kg.  In general, the patient was lethargic
but arousable and in acute respiratory distress.  Head, eyes,
ears, nose, and throat examination revealed pupils were
equal, round, and reactive to light and accommodation.
Extraocular movements were intact.  The patient had psoriatic
plaques over her forehead, upper dentures.  Her oropharynx
was clear, and her mucous membranes were dry.  The patient
was found to have jugular venous distention to the angle of
her jaw.  On pulmonary examination, the patient was had
crackles three quarters of the way up on the right with
decreased breath sounds.  She had crackles one half of the
way up on the left with occasional wheezes.  The patient had
an irregularly irregular cardiac rhythm with a mechanical
second heart sound heart sound.  Her abdomen was distended,
diffusely tender, and there were active bowel sounds.  She
had bilateral lower extremity 2+ pitting edema with bilateral
erythema, warmth, and tenderness.   The patient was alert and
oriented times three.  Cranial nerves II through XII were
grossly intact.  The patient had normal sensory function, and
she was moving all extremities spontaneously.

PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:  On initial
laboratory evaluation, the patient had a white blood cell
count of 6.3, hematocrit was 24.6, and platelets were 192.
Her PT was 19.2, PTT was 35.1, and INR was 2.6.  Initial
serum chemistries demonstrated sodium was 135, potassium
was 2.5, chloride was 87, bicarbonate was 39, blood urea
nitrogen was 41, creatinine was 0.9, and a serum glucose
was 201.  An initial set of cardiac enzymes was negative.
Urinalysis demonstrated positive nitrites, small leukocyte
esterase, 11 to 20 white blood cells, many bacteria, and 3 to
5 epithelial cells.  Blood cultures and urine cultures were
also taken.

RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:   An electrocardiogram demonstrated atrial
fibrillation at a rate of 79 beats per minute with
significant ventricular ectopy.  There was a normal axis.
There was evidence of intravenous conduction delay with a
rapid response.  There were no Q waves except for isolated Q
waves in aVL.  There were no ST changes except for a 0.5-mm
ST depression in leads II and III.  There was also evidence
of old T wave flattening.

As mentioned above, the patient was found to have an ejection
fraction of 40%, 3+ mitral regurgitation, 1+ tricuspid
regurgitation, and mild pulmonary artery hypertension.  These
findings were demonstrated on a transthoracic echocardiogram
done in [**2117-8-9**].

In addition, she had a cardiac catheterization in [**2117-8-9**].  This study demonstrated 100% proximal right coronary
artery stenosis with diffuse right coronary artery disease,
septal inferior 60%, first diagonal of 20%, obtuse
marginal of 60%.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Given her low hematocrit and evidence of
active gastrointestinal bleeding the patient was admitted to
the Medical Intensive Care Unit for monitoring.

She was transfused 3 units of packed red blood cells on
hospital day one.  In addition, given that the patient had a
myocardial infarction one month prior to admission when her
hematocrit was approximately 12, and given that she was
complaining of intermittent angina the week prior to
admission, the patient was evaluated for the possibility of a
myocardial infarction by serial cardiac enzymes.

Given her worsening respiratory status with evidence of fluid
overload, the patient was diuresed as needed.  Her evidence
of erythema, tenderness, and edema of the bilateral lower
extremities was most likely secondary to venous stasis and
lymphedema versus cellulitis.  Therefore, she was started on
Ancef prophylactically for treatment of cellulitis.

Given her elevated INR at 2.6 (which was therapeutic in terms
of her anticoagulation for her St. [**M
