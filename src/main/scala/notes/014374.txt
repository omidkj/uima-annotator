Reason: RIGHT IJ FOR CLOT

INDICATION: 72-year-old female with right arm swelling.

COMPARISON: No previous exams for comparison.

FINDINGS: Grayscale, color, and Doppler son[**Name (NI) 1417**] of the right
IJ, subclavian, axillary, brachial, basilic, and cephalic veins
were performed. There is nonocclusive thrombus seen within the
right IJ. Flow is documented around the clot at this site. The
right cephalic vein does not compress, and no flow is identified
in that vessel. Normal flow, compression, and augmentation are
seen within the remainder of the right arm veins.

IMPRESSION:
1. Nonocclusive thrombus in the right IJ.
2. Occlusive thrombus in the right cephalic vein.

Findings
This study was compared to the prior study of [**2118-4-1**].
RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Normal RA size.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV cavity size. Moderately depressed
LVEF.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.
Paradoxic septal motion consistent with prior cardiac surgery.

AORTA: Normal aortic diameter at the sinus level.

AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS.
No AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Bioprosthetic mitral valve prosthesis (MVR).
Increased MVR gradient. No MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Mildly thickened tricuspid valve leaflets.
Physiologic TR. Moderate PA systolic hypertension.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflets
with physiologic PR.
Conclusions
The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is moderately depressed with
global hypokinesis (LVEF= 35-40 %). Right ventricular chamber
size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) are mildly thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No
aortic regurgitation is seen. A bioprosthetic mitral valve
prosthesis appears well-seated with good leaflet motion. The
gradients are higher than expected for this type of prosthesis
(may be due to small sized valve). No mitral regurgitation is
seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There
is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a
partially echodense effusion predominantly around the right
atrium (less echodense and less prominent than previously).

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2118-4-1**],
left ventricular systolic function appears slightly more
impaired.

INDICATION: Please check PICC tip position.

COMPARISON: The chest AP portable upright from [**2118-4-5**].

CHEST AP PORTABLE UPRIGHT: The heart is still enlarged with
evidence of increased pulmonary venous pressure and bilateral
pleural effusions and atelectasis. The bilateral effusion on the
right appears more prominent. The tip of the PICC line is in the
wall of the proximal SVC. No pneumothorax detected.

IMPRESSION:
1. Tip of PICC line in wall of proximal SVC. No pneumothorax.
2. Bilateral atelectasis, more prominent on the right.
Otherwise, no other interval changes since the previous study.


Brief Hospital Course:
She was taken to the operating room on [**3-29**] where she underwent
a redo-sternotomy and MVR. She was transferred to the ICU in
critical but stable condition on epinephrine and neo.
Postoperative echo showed clot around the right atrium. She had
a large volume requirement and was transfused as well. Her epi
was weaned to off by POD #2. She was extubated on POD #2. She
was thrombocytopenic, HIT screen was negative. Her platelet
count continued to drop, she was given platelets and she was
seen by hematology who continued to follow. She had aflutter for
which she was put on amio, and she returned to NSR. Blood
cultures grew gram negative rods and she was seen by general
surgery. CT abdomen/pelvis was negative. She was seen by ID.
Line tip also grew gram negative rods and she was started on
cipro and flagyl. Coverage was broadened to include ceftazidime.
She improved and was transferred to the
