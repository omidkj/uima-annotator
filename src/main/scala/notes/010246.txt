Brief Hospital Course:
59 yo M with non ischemic CMP, EF 15-20%, s/p elective hernia
repairs now with relative hypotension and ARF. His hospital stay
for this admission is as follows.
.
1  Hypotension. NYHA Class III CHF, severe systolic dysfunction
with EF of 15-20%. He received some fluid resucitation on the
floor after the elective surgery at the time of hypotension, but
was unresponsive to fluid resuscitation, and with poor UO
(5cc/hr).  Likely worsening cardiac output with poor renal
perfusion. On presentation to the CCU, it was very difficult to
eval fluid status on exam, appears close to euvolemic. We
started him on dopamine gtt to increase his renal perfusion and
held beta-blocker, [**Last Name (un) **], and lasix (given rising Cr).  His BP
stabilized overnight in the normotensive range.  We continued
monitoring his I/Os, and he was able to have good UOs without
lasix or fluids, we gradually weaned him off the dopamine gtt.
On his second day at the CCU, his BP continued to remain within
normotensive range, and he was started on Coreg 12.5mg PO bid,
and he was transferred to the step down unit on [**2175-9-1**], his
Blood pressure continued ranging between 102-117/63-80 on the
floor.  He was told to hold off [**Last Name (un) **] intially, and check BP
regulary, start with low dose [**Last Name (un) **] and check with PCP and
cardiologist for adjustment of meds.
.
2 Rhythm. Chronic A.fib with intermittent RVR, rate up to 140s
prior to transfer to CCU, has been off coumadin prior to
surgery. Upon transfering to the CCU, we put him on tele,
initially held betal block and coumadin, which was restarted on
[**2175-9-1**], and continued monitoring his INR. He was to follow
regular INR check with his PCP to keep it between [**3-3**].  He had
two 10-11 beats of NSVT on telemetry while in the hospital, but
completely asymptomatic at the time, most likely from his
congestive heart failure.  An ICD implant was offered to him by
the CHF team, but pt has refused that option.  He is followed by
the CHF team (Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 437**].
.
3 CHF. dilated cardiomyopathy - followed by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 437**].  He was
intially started on Digoxin 0.25mg po qday which was decreased
to 0.125mg given ARF.  Bblock and [**Last Name (un) **] was initially held given
hypotension, which coreg was restarted once BP stabilized and
renal function improved.  An ICD implant was offered to him by
the CHF team, but pt has refused that option.  He is followed by
the CHF team (Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 437**].
.
4 Ischemia. No CP. Clean coronaries.
.
5 ARF. Unclear etiology, very rapid rise in Cr on the floor post
elective hernia repair, sodium avid by urine lytes (Na <10,
FUrea 4%) suggesting severe prerenal state. He was started on
dopamine gTT to help renal profusion and hypotension intially.
Initally UA at the time of transfer to CCU showed evidence of
UTI, we started him on Cipro, but subsequent UA and urine Cx (no
growth to date) not suggestive of UTI, so Cipro was d/c'ed.
Patient has been off coumadin prior to surgery, renal u/s showed
echogenic kidney suggesting medical renal disease, no evidence
of renal arteries stenosis, unable to evaluate renal vein
thrombosis. KUB showed normal kidney and vessels.  He continued
to have good UO at the CCU, and we gradually wean him off the
dopamine gtt, his Cr continued to trend down 3.2->2.0->1.6->1.3
which is his baseline.
.
6 Hyponatremia. Na 136->127 since admit. Likely hypervolemic
hyponatremia in setting of CHF. Upon transfer to the CCU, his
hyponatremia resolved.  We followed closely his volume status,
and he appeared to be euvolemic on exam.
.
7 Anemia. Hct trending down initially, likely dilutional, guiac
negative; subsequently stabilized around 31.  Iron studies
consistent with anemia of chronic disease.
.
8 DM. RISS for tight control.
.
9 Hyperlipidemia. Continue statin.
.
10 LFT initially slightly elevated, likely back up congestion
from his CHF exacerbation.  continued monitored his LFTs, which
started trending down once hypotension and ARF resolved.
.
11 thrombocytopenia: his platelets stable around 100,000.  Pt
aware will follow up with his PCP for further workup.
.
12 hernia repair: pain control with percocet. no hematoma,
drainage, or signs of infection at the incision site.
.
13 GERD. PPI
.
14 FEN. Reg diet, monitor and replace lytes prn, no standing
fluids.
.
15 PPx. Heparin SC, PPI, po diet, ambulation,
.
