Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1167**]
Chief Complaint:
back/shoulder pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
cardiac cath

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 76M with CAD (s/p Cath [**2157**], medically
managed), with PPM, PVD s/p RLE angioplasty, CEA ('[**52**]), DM, and
multiple strokes who was transferred on [**5-17**] from OSH with NSTEMI
and Cardiogenic Shock requiring IABP.  The patient was initially
transferred to the Cardiac Surgery service, but is thought to
have Coronary anatomy amenable to PCI rather than CABG.  Patient
is being transferred to the CCU Service for further management.
.
Briefly, the patient reports that over the past two weeks he has
noted numbness in both of his upper extremities with exertion.
The patient reported that he started to have intermittent back
and shoulder pain (bilateral) over the past two days (at rest
and with exertion) and that led him to seek care from his
cardiologist who referred him to OSH ED for further evaluation.

.
At [**Hospital **] Hospital, the patient was found to he in heart
failure and ruled in for NSTEMI with Trop T of 1.02; CK 639,
CKMB 43.1.  The patient had cardiac catheterization that showed
normal LMCA, 90% prox LAD stenosis, D1 with mild Dz, Chronically
occluded Ramus, 100% RCA CTO, with L to R collateralization.
Patient's CI was 1.6 and IABP was placed in setting of
cardiogenic shock.  Patient was given Lasix IV x 1 for diuresis.
.
The patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**5-17**] by [**Location (un) 7622**] and was
admitted to the surgical service for CABG.  After review of his
anatomy, the patient was thought to be a candidate for PCI and
is being tranferred to the CCU service after his
catheterization.
.
On review of systems, he denies any pulmonary embolism, bleeding
at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough,
hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.  He denies recent
fevers, chills or rigors.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for current absence of
chest pain.  Patient reported dyspnea on exertion prior to
admission to OSH.  No current orthopnea, ankle edema,
palpitations, syncope or presyncope.  Patient has a history of
syncope requiring PPM.
.

Imaging:
ECHO
[**2164-5-17**]

The left atrium is mildly dilated. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF= 20-25 %). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened (?#). The study is
inadequate to exclude significant aortic valve stenosis. Trace
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
structurally normal. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The
estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is
a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Severely depressed global left ventricular systolic
function with relative preservation of the basal inferolateral
and anteroseptal segments. Inadequate image quality to exclude
significant aortic stenosis. Certainly by transaortic valvular
gradient and peak velocity severe aortic stenosis does not
appear to be present, however given the severely impaired left
ventricular systolic function it cannot be ruled out. Mild
mitral regurgitation. Normal pulmonary artery systolic pressure.


Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] notified of the results by e-mail on [**2164-5-17**] at
10:10 p.m.

[**2164-5-18**]
CAROTID SERIES
IMPRESSION: Findings as stated above which indicate: 1) 60-69%
right ICA
stenosis.

2) A 40-59% left ICA stenosis, graded closer to 40%.

3) High-grade stenosis involving both external carotid arteries
which may
account for any bruit heard on physical exam.

[**2164-5-19**]:
CXR
As compared to [**2164-5-17**], there is significant worsening of
pulmonary
edema, currently alveolar and involving the entire lungs.
Bilateral pleural
effusions are most likely present. Cardiomediastinal silhouette
is unchanged.
There is no evidence of pneumothorax.
