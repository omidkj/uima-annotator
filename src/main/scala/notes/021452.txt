creatinine 6.2, ALT 21, AST 39, alkaline phosphatase 266,

Ultrasound:  Dilated intrahepatic ducts, common bile duct
cannot be assessed, gallbladder with sludge.  CT of the
abdomen:  Dilated common bile duct at 20 mm, dilated
intrahepatic ducts.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient is a 61 year old male with
multiple medical problems, including AIDS, chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease, pancreatitis, adrenal
insufficiency, and colectomy for diverticulitis, who now
presents with acute renal failure and biliary obstruction,
probable cholecystitis with obstruction and cholangitis.

1.  Liver/infectious disease:  The patient had an increased
bilirubin and jaundice, consistent with an obstructive
biliary process and cholangitis.  He was started on
vancomycin and Zosyn for sepsis.  Blood cultures grew out
Klebsiella.

The patient underwent an endoscopic retrograde
cholangiopancreatography on [**2177-9-23**] which showed
distal common bile duct stricture due to mass lesion, distal
common bile duct obstruction, suppurative cholangitis,
choledochoduodenal fistula, nonfilling of the gallbladder,
stent placement in the common bile duct, peri-ampullary
diverticulum, pancreatic duct was not injected.

The patient was continued on antibiotics and, when the
sensitivities of the Klebsiella came back sensitive to
ceftriaxone, the patient was switched to intravenous
ceftriaxone and vancomycin was discontinued.  The patient
continued to be afebrile on ceftriaxone for several days,
which was then switched to oral Levaquin and Flagyl which was
added.

Post stenting, the patient's bilirubin trended down
significantly over the next several days and his jaundice
also improved.  He continued to be afebrile.  The patient
will need stent removal in four to six weeks from [**2177-9-23**] for re-evaluation of the bile duct obstruction.

2.  Renal:  The patient had acute tubular necrosis secondary
to hypotension and sepsis, which gradually resolved over the
several days of his stay in the Medical Intensive Care Unit.
The patient was hydrated and his creatinine gradually
improved into the range of 2, and his electrolytes were
repleted accordingly as the acute tubular necrosis entered a
diuresis phase, which the patient is still in at the time of
discharge.

3.  HIV:  The patient was discontinued on HAART medication as
he felt that he was unable to tolerate the medications and
just stopped taking all of his HAART medications as well as
his prophylaxis.  After much discussion, it was decided that
he should not be placed back on these medications, as he is
unlikely to be compliant, but may benefit at some point in
the future from restarting them.

4.  Endocrine:  The patient has adrenal insufficiency and was
started on stress dosed steroids, which will be tapered from
Prednisone 40 mg daily on [**2177-9-29**] to 30 mg p.o.q.d.
on [**2177-9-28**] with a decrease of 10 mg each day until a
level of 7.5 mg daily is reached, at which dose the patient
will remain on.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Common bile duct obstruction secondary to mass suspicious
for biliary duct carcinoma.
2.  Sepsis.
3.  Acute tubular necrosis.
4.  HIV/AIDS.
5.  Adrenal insufficiency.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  The patient is somewhat
deconditioned on discharge, as he has gone through several
fairly significant illnesses, and will need a stay in a short
term rehabilitation facility for improvement of his
ambulation and his oral intake prior to returning home.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
MS Contin 15 mg p.o.b.i.d.
Atenolol 25 mg p.o.q.d.
Prednisone 30 mg p.o.q.d., then 20 mg p.o.q.d., then 10 mg
p.o.q.d., each for one day, and then 7.5 mg p.o.q.d. standing
dose.
Levofloxacin 500 mg p.o.q.d.
Flagyl 500 mg p.o.t.i.d.
Ambien 5 mg p.o.q.h.s.p.r.n.
