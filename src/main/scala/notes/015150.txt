History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 1305**] is a 69 year old gravida 3, para 3 female with Stage
IIIC optimally debulked primary peritoneal serous cancer with
further disease progression since, presenting with left upper
quadrant abdominal pain that started the night prior to
admission. The pain is consant and accompanied by nausea.
Multiple episodes of small-volume emesis today. Last bowel
movement yesterday. No flatus or bowel movement since. She was
seen for her regularly scheduled medical oncology appointment
today by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]  and a stat CT abdomen/pelvis was
ordered showing a bowel obstruction with transition point in
LUQ. Given zofran, ativan, and morphine in clinic with little
relief of symptoms.
Of note, Ms. [**Known lastname 1305**] [**Last Name (Titles) 1834**] a exploratory laparotomy/lysis of
adhesions/ radical hysterectomy/rectosigmoid resection with
reanastamosis/ cystotomy repair/ Low anterior resection/
omentectomy in [**2168-11-28**] and was considered optimally
debulked at that point. She initially [**Year (4 digits) 1834**] 6 cycles of
carboplatin and taxol followed by repeated chemotherapy
treatments including carboplatin/doxil, avastin, and gemcitabine
until [**2170-11-28**]. She was found to have disease progression
by CT and CA-125 in [**Month (only) 547**] of this year. She is currently
enrolled in a clinical trial for ciplatin vs. olaparib in
advanced solid tumors.

Pertinent Results:
IMAGING:

CT Abdomen/pelvis with contrast ([**7-18**]):
FINDINGS:
CHEST: The base of the heart is unremarkable without pericardial
effusion.
The lung bases have minimal bilateral atelectasis. There are no
pleural
effusions, focal consolidation, or nodules.
ABDOMEN: The liver, gallbladder, pancreas, and spleen are
unremarkable. There are no intra- or extra-hepatic biliary duct
dilation. The portal venous system is patent. The bilateral
adrenals are unremarkable. The bilateral kidneys are
unremarkable and enhance and excrete contrast appropriately. The
stomach is distended. The small bowel is also distended from the
proximal duodenum through to a transition point best seen in
image 2, 43. There were no masses seen adjacent to the
transition point. Distal to this transition point is completely
collapsed small bowel. This is consistent with an early complete
small bowel obstruction. There is fecalization of the small
bowel contents directly proximal to the obstruction. There is no
free air or ascites in the abdomen. The large bowel is
unremarkable and noted to have stool from the rectum to the
cecum. This could mean that the obstruction is either early or
partial, but given the severity of the distal small bowel
collapse, it likely is an early complete obstruction. There is
minimal stranding in the mesentery. There are small periaortic
lymph nodes, none of which meet criteria for pathological
enlargement. There are multiple surgical clips in the abdomen.
The patient appears to be status post omentectomy. The
urinary bladder is not distended, but unremarkable. There is no
free fluid in the pelvis. There is no pelvic or inguinal
lymphadenopathy. The patient is s/p total abdominal
hysterectomy.
OSSEOUS STRUCTURES: There are no concerning lytic or sclerotic
bony lesions.
SOFT TISSUES: The patient is status post left mastectomy with
breast implant. There are no soft tissue nodules or hernias.
IMPRESSION:
1. Early complete small bowel obstruction with transition point
in the left upper quadrant. Of note, the colon is not yet
collapsed and has stool
throughout, which indicates early obstruction.

Portable abdominal radiograph ([**7-19**]): FINDINGS: Portable supine
and upright views of the abdomen are provided.  There is a
paucity of small bowel gas consistent with the finding of a
small-bowel obstruction. There is no free air or pneumotosis
identified in this film.
CONCLUSION: No signs of free air. Bowel gas pattern consistent
with
small-bowel obstruction.

Portable chest radiograph ([**7-19**]): The lungs are low in volume
and show bilateral lower lobe opacities. The cardiac silhouette
is enlarged. The mediastinal silhouette and hilar contours are
normal. No pleural effusions or pneumothorax. A left-sided
subclavian line terminates with its tip in the cavoatrial
junction. An NG tube passes out of view below the diaphragm.
IMPRESSION: Bibasilar opacities could represent sequelae of
aspiration or atelectasis


CT Chest/Abdomen ([**7-19**]): CT OF THE CHEST WITH AND WITHOUT
CONTRAST: The imaged portion of the thyroid gland is normal in
appearance. There is no axillary, hilar, mediastinal or
supraclavicular pathologic lymphadenopathy with scattered
nonenlarged nodes seen. Heart and pericardium are unremarkable
without pericardial effusion.  The aorta and major branches are
patent with normal three-vessel arch.  Central venous catheter
is seen terminating in the superior cavoatrial junction with no
acute aortic pathology identified. No pulmonary embolism is
seen. Trace right pleural effusion with resultant atelectasis is
seen.  Hypoenhancing consolidative process is seen in the left
base concerning for aspiration. The remainder of the lungs are
clear. Nasogastric tube is seen coursing through the esophagus
and terminating in the stomach.
CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH CONTRAST: The liver is normal in
appearance without
focal lesion or intra- or extra-hepatic biliary ductal
dilatation. Portal and hepatic veins appear patent. Gallbladder,
pancreas, spleen, and bilateral adrenal glands are unremarkable.
The kidneys enhance and excrete contrast symmetrically without
hydronephrosis or focal lesion.
Stomach is not as distended as on the prior study after
decompression with
nasogastric tube. Proximal small bowel loops are dilated,
slightly less so
than on the prior study with likely transition point within the
left upper
quadrant and decompressed distal loops compatible with
small-bowel
obstruction. Compared to the prior study, there is some passage
of oral
contrast administered at that time one day prior with contrast
seen within
loops of distal ileum as well as in large bowel. There is a
decrease degree of intraperitoneal fluid since the prior study.
No free air is seen. No mesenteric or retroperitoneal pathologic
lymphadenopathy is identified with scattered nonenlarged likely
are reactive in nature. Atherosclerotic calcification of the
aorta
