Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Persantine IV / Indocin

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2387**]
Chief Complaint:
chest pain, shortness of breath, and left lower extremity pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None.


History of Present Illness:
61M w/hx of CAD, 4 MIs s/p stents, CABG, s/p PPM/ICD, CHF, DM,
s/p RCA stent on [**7-17**] with multiple recent admissions for chest
pain, presenting with chest pain and palpitations in addition
the left lower extremity pain. Patient reports that he has been
having "[**Doctor Last Name **]-hammer like palpitations" since his discharge on
[**7-20**].  He has also felt lightheaded and short of breath with the
chest pain.  He has been taking his home medications as
prescribed, and took 4 SL nitroglycerins today.  He took a walk
today and after 500 yards had such severe palpitations that he
had to turn around.  He took his blood pressure and it was
70/43.  His wife called the ambulance at that time.
.
Patient is also complaining of left lower extremity pain.  He
reports that the pain began on Tuesday, [**7-18**], during his initial
admission.  He mentioned the pain to the team at that time, but
per patient's report, the team did not think it was significant.
 During his last admission, patient did not mention that the
pain was continuing as he thought that it was not significant.
Patient denies any swelling or redness in the left lower
extremity but reports that it has been "a different color" than
the right.
.
Patient went to [**Hospital **] hospital where he was given a total of
2500cc IVF for low blood pressure and started on a heparin drip
given concern for ACS.  He had one set of negative cardiac
enzymes and was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further care.
.
On arrival to [**Hospital1 18**], VS were T 97.9 P 80 BP 72/51 RR 18 Sat 99%
4L nc. Blood pressures improved into the 90s systolic.  A second
set of cardiac enzymes were negative, BNP was normal and EKG was
unchanged from baseline.  Blood pressure dropped into the 70s
systolic.  An arterial line was placed which was [**Location (un) 1131**] 20mmHg
above cuff pressure, showing SBPs of 100s so pressors were
turned off after 30min and BPs stayed stable in 90-100s.
Patient was also complaining of a swollen and painful left leg.
Given patient's history of a prior PE, a LLE ultrasound was
performed in the ED which showed evidence of clot in one of the
left peroneal veins but no other deep veins.
.
Of note, the patient was recently admitted on [**7-19**] for chest
pain and palpitations of a similar nature.  Symptoms were
consistent with angina, however, could not rule out tachycardia.
 Pacer had not recorded any periods of rate>160, but was reset
to record with rates >135.  During the previous admission, CE
were negative and EKG was unchanged.
.
On arrival to the floor, patient's vital signs were  T97.7 BP
107/64 HR 80 RR 14 02Sat 98%on RA.  Patient was complaining of
ongoing chest pain and was extremely anxious about the potential
for a clot in his leg or of another cardiac event.

Brief Hospital Course:
Primary Reason for Hospitalization:
61 yo [**Male First Name (un) 4746**] with extensive cardiac history including CAD, s/p
numerous MIs, CABG, PCIs with stents, presenting with chest pain
and hypotension.
.
Active issues:
# Hypotension: While patient was hypotensive on presentation to
the ED with systolics in 70s, once arterial line was placed in
ED, pressures were noted to be 20mmHg above cuff [**Location (un) 1131**], and
consistent with patient's baseline pressures of systolic 90s.
LE ultrasound indicating DVT, and given associated chest pain,
hypotension may be due to pulmonary embolism.  However, did not
appear to be a hemodynamically significant PE given resolution
of patient's hypotension with fluid resuscitation and that
arterial line is showing normal, baseline pressures.
In addition, a component of patient's initial hypotension was
likely due to over medication at home as patient took several SL
nitro pills.  Patient received 2.5L IVF in ED with improvement
in symptoms.  Patient's home carvedilol, lisinopril, and
isosorbide mononitrate were held initially.  In additon,
diuretics (bumetanide and spironolactone) were held in setting
of po
