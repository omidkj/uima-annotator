Admission Date:  [**2142-8-21**]       Discharge Date:  [**2142-8-29**]

Date of Birth:   [**2090-3-28**]       Sex:  F

Service:  [**Hospital1 139**]

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This was a 52-year-old female
with a past medical history of pneumonia, chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease, and a history of tuberculosis exposure
with a negative PPD on [**2142-8-19**], who presented to her
primary care physician for [**Name9 (PRE) 102715**] symptoms.  She was
treated as an outpatient with levofloxacin; however, her
symptoms continued to worsen.  On [**2142-8-18**], the patient
went to an outside hospital with an oxygen requirement and a
white blood cell count of 13.8.  The patient was admitted and
started on ceftriaxone, azithromycin, as well as levofloxacin
and doxycycline.  At the outside hospital, the patient had a
bronchoscopy performed which showed no masses, negative
bronchoalveolar lavage for acid fast bacilli, Chlamydia,
Legionella.  The patient was subsequently intubated for an
oxygen requirement and transferred to [**Hospital1 190**] for a lung biopsy.

The patient was taken to the Medical Intensive Care Unit
during her stay there on [**2142-8-21**] to [**2142-8-28**].  On
admission, the patient was thought to have a
community-acquired pneumonia which caused the oxygen
requirement but also the possibility of an interstitial
process.  The patient was started on ceftriaxone,
azithromycin, and Levaquin for probable community-acquired
pneumonia.  A CT scan was performed which showed evidence of
an infectious process bilaterally and some pulmonary edema.

On [**2142-8-22**], the Cardiothoracic Surgery Service was
consulted to perform a lung biopsy.  The right middle lobe
was biopsied which showed adult respiratory distress syndrome
in the exudative phase.  The patient continued to improve and
was extubated on [**2142-8-23**].  At that time, her oxygen
requirement was three liters for 97 percent oxygenation.  An
echocardiogram was performed which showed an ejection
fraction of 65 percent in an otherwise normal heart.

The [**Hospital 228**] medical Intensive Care Unit stay was
complicated by agitation and confusion after her extubation.
Psychiatry was consulted, and the patient was found to have a
history of drug abuse and alcohol abuse.  There was concern
that she may have gone through withdrawal, and also this
could be delirium secondary to sedation.

The patient was monitored in the Intensive Care Unit for
several days.  Her symptoms improved.  She required less
oxygenation.  The patient was transferred to the [**Last Name (un) 102716**] B
Service on [**2142-8-28**].

At that time, the patient stated that she was feeling good
with an occasional cough and clear sputum.  The patient had
an occasional diarrhea, but at the time of transfer, she
denied any fevers, chills, nausea, vomiting, chest pain,
shortness of breath, dysuria or abdominal pain.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Her past medical history is
significant for hypertension, depression, gastroesophageal
reflux disease, history of pancreatitis, chronic pain,
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, history of
tuberculosis exposure with a negative PPD on [**2142-8-19**].

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On transfer, her temperature was 97.3,
blood pressure 98/62, pulse 85, respiratory rate 20, oxygen
saturation 94 percent in room air.  In general, the patient
was ambulating, in no acute distress, pleasant, talking in
complete sentences.  HEENT:  Pupils are equal, round, and
reactive to light and accommodation.  Neck examination
revealed no jugular venous distention, no lymphadenopathy.
Cardiovascular exam revealed a regular rate and rhythm, no
murmurs, rubs or gallops.  Pulmonary exam revealed crackles
at the bases bilaterally.  He had no wheezing and no rhonchi.
 His abdomen was nontender and nondistended with positive
bowel sounds.  Extremity exam revealed good pulses in all
four extremities.  Neurological exam revealed he was alert
and oriented times three.  Cranial nerves II through XII were
intact.

LABORATORY DATA:  On transfer, her white count was 19.0,
hematocrit 32.3.  CT of the head showed no acute intracranial
hemorrhage or mass effect.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was monitored on the Medicine
Service.  The patient had improving mental status without any
episodes of confusion or agitation.  The patient remained
afebrile on the floor and had oxygen saturation of 98 percent
in room air prior to her discharge.  The patient was
continued on ceftriaxone and azithromycin for her resolving
community-acquired pneumonia.

The patient was reevaluated by Psychiatry, and she was deemed
