Service:  NEUROSURGERY

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This 86 year-old retired
vascular surgeon has a long history of hypertension.  He was
doing well until approximately two weeks ago when he was
swimming.  He was actually sitting on the edge of the pool
kicking his legs in the water when he noted the sudden onset
of a severe headache.  This persisted for several hours.
There was no nausea or vomiting.  For the next two weeks the
patient did not quite feel himself.  He did not have his
usual energy.  He was not exercising.  He complained of
various aches and pains.  At the same time his dog, who is
his constant companion had died.  It was felt that this may
be contributing to his symptoms.  On the day of admission the
patient noted the onset of another severe headache.  His
family then brought him into the Emergency Department.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  The patient is otherwise healthy.  He
has been taking Sular for his hypertension.  He has a home
blood pressure machine and has been taking his pressure
daily. This has been in the 120 to 150 range.  He has also
been on various cholesterol lowering agents.  He has had
difficulties with muscle cramps with them.  When he is not
medicated his cholesterol will range from 250 to 300.  The
patient is right handed.  He lives independently.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On physical examination the patient is
awake and alert.  He is in no acute distress.  He is
complaining of a moderate headache.  His neck is supple and
mobile.  There are no external signs of trauma.  His speech
is normal in content and comprehension.  His long and short
term memory are good.  His cranial nerves are intact.  He has
no drift.  His coordination is good.  His chest is clear.
Cardiac regular rate and rhythm.  Abdomen is soft and
nontender.  Extremities no clubbing, cyanosis or edema.  His
blood pressure is ranging from 180 to 220/90.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was sent for a CT scan of the
head.  This demonstrated a small amount of blood layering in
the occipital horns bilaterally.  There is no evidence of any
subarachnoid hemorrhage.  The patient was started on a
nitroprusside drip to try to control his hypertension.  His
blood pressure was kept in the 140 to 150 range.  A CT
angiogram was obtained.  This showed marked atherosclerotic
disease with tortuosity and calcification in virtually all of
his major vessels.  There was a bit of prominence to his
internal carotid arteries bilaterally in their supraclinoid
portion, along with a question of a bit of prominence of the
vascular tip, and the posterior communicating arteries.
However, no clear aneurysm was seen.  On the first hospital
day the patient remained awake and alert.  He was still
complaining of headache.  A cerebral angiogram was
attempted.  Unfortunately, because of the patient's severe
atherosclerotic disease and the patient's difficulty
cooperating this examination was extremely limited.  Only two
vessels were studied.  There was a good view of the basilar
tip, which looked entirely intact.  His vertebrals were
somewhat tortuous, but there was no evidence of any
posterior circulation aneurysms.  An arch study was done and
the left internal carotid was imaged.  There was extensive
atherosclerotic disease, but no clear aneurysm.  The patient
then had an MRI scan and MRA.  This demonstrated some
subarachnoid hemorrhage in the sylvian fissure bilaterally.
Because of this finding the patient was then taken back for
an attempt at a second angiogram.  This was done under a
general anesthetic.  During this time it was noted that his
creatinine increased from 1.4 to 2.  The angiogram seemed to
demonstrate an irregular 8 mm posterior communicating artery
aneurysm.  It was felt that this was likely the source of the
patient's hemorrhage.  The patient had no evidence of any
spasm.

During this time the patient had two major medical issues.
The first was his creatinine continued to rise to 4.  He was
making good urine anywhere to 80 to 100 cc an hour.  He was
seen by the Medicine Service.  They recommended increasing
his fluids to 125 cc of half normal saline.  In addition, he
was also noted to have low grade fevers.  A chest x-ray was
obtained.  This showed a small left lower lobe infiltrate.
The patient was started on Levofloxacin 250 mg every other
day.  The situation was discussed at length with the patient
and his family.  Because of his multiple medical problems,
the great difficulty doing his diagnostic angiogram and the
calcification and tortuosity of his vessels, it was decided
to transfer the patient to [**Hospital1 2025**] for further management.  Both
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5730**] and Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] were notified.  They agreed to take
the patient in transfer.  On the morning of transfer the
patient got up to brush his teeth and traumatically removed
his Foley catheter.  This resulted in an extensive blood
loss.  However, the patient remained hemodynamically stable.
A new Foley catheter was placed.  He was awake and alert.  A
hematocrit was pending at the time of his discharge.

FINAL DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Posterior communicating artery aneurysm.
2.  Subarachnoid and intraventricular hemorrhage.
3.  Pneumonia.
4.  Post contrast nephropathy.
5.  Extensive hematuria.

PLANS FOR DISCHARGE:  The patient is being transferred to
[**Hospital3 2576**] [**Hospital3 **] for further care.
