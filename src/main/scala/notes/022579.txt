Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 165**]
Chief Complaint:
aortic valve endocarditis


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2181-4-11**] Aortic valve replacement with a size 21 St. [**Male First Name (un) 923**] Regent
mechanical valve for aortic valve endocarditis


History of Present Illness:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 32496**] is a 62 yo female who reports 2 months of not
feeling well. She states that she stopped driving 2 months ago
and nearly 1 month ago began feeling poorly with decreased
appetite, decreased mobility and really
started feeling badly about 1-2 weeks prior to admission with
very limited mobility and a 30 pound weight loss in 1 month.
She has been dizzy and short of breath.  She was found to be in
acute renal failure with a creatinine of 6.6 and anemic with
hematocrit of 23.  She was hydrated and transfused 3 units PRBC.
 Her renal failure was thought to be due to acute interstitial
nephritis.
She had blood cultures positive for entercoccus on [**3-23**] and
[**3-25**], with negative blood cultures since.  The source of
enterococcus has not been found.  She has developed worsening LE
edema, and recurrent rapid atrial fibrillation and a repeat
echocardiogram [**4-3**] showed worsening AI.  She is transfered for
surgical
evaulation.

Findings
Multiplanar reconstructions were generated and confirmed on an
independent workstation.

LEFT ATRIUM: Mild LA enlargement. Moderate to severe spontaneous
echo contrast in the body of the LA. Depressed LAA emptying
velocity (<0.2m/s) All four pulmonary veins not identified.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Normal RA size. No ASD by 2D or
color Doppler.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Wall thickness and cavity dimensions were
obtained from 2D images. Normal LV cavity size. Low normal LVEF.


RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTA: Mildy dilated aortic root. Normal ascending aorta
diameter. Normal descending aorta diameter. Simple atheroma in
descending aorta.

AORTIC VALVE: Three aortic valve leaflets. Severely
thickened/deformed aortic valve leaflets. Large vegetation on
aortic valve. No aortic valve abscess. No AS. Moderate to severe
(3+) AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Moderately thickened mitral valve leaflets. No MS.
Mild to moderate ([**2-4**]+) MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets with trivial
TR.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflet.
No PS. Physiologic PR.

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify I was present in compliance with HCFA
regulations. The TEE probe was passed with assistance from the
anesthesioology staff using a laryngoscope. No TEE related
complications.

REGIONAL LEFT VENTRICULAR WALL MOTION:





     N = Normal, H = Hypokinetic, A = Akinetic, D = Dyskinetic
Conclusions
PRE-BYPASS: The left atrium is mildly dilated. Moderate to
severe spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body of the left
atrium. The left atrial appendage emptying velocity is depressed
(<0.2m/s). No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color
Doppler. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%).
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. There are
simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. There are
three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets are
severely thickened/deformed. There is a large vegetation on the
aortic valve. No aortic valve abscess is seen. There is no
aortic valve stenosis. Moderate to severe (3+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are moderately
thickened. Mild to moderate ([**2-4**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.

POST CPB:
1. Unchanged LV and RV function. LVEF = 55%
2. Bileaflet mechanical valve in aortic posi
