- [**12-14**] found to have brain metastases
- s/p:
1. Cyberknife SRS [**Date range (1) 46548**] to 2750 cGy brainstem
2. Cyberknife SRS [**2178-5-5**] to 1800 cGy left cerebellar met
3. WBXRT [**Date range (1) 46549**]/07 to 3600 cGy
4. Sutent started [**2178-7-7**]
- VP shunt placed on [**10-15**] for hydrocephalus seen secondary to
met in tectum.

Pertinent Results:
CXR:
1.  Retrocardiac opacity may correspond to the clinically
suspected pneumonia.
2.  Increased right infrahilar opacity, which could reflect
worsening
adenopathy.
3.  Stable appearance of left hilar mass and multiple left lung
nodules.
.
CT head:
 Unchanged appearance of hyperdense right midbrain mass lesion.
The hyperdense appearance may represent internal hemorrhage or
progressive
dystrophic calcification as described before.  No additional
intracranial
hemorrhage is seen.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 62M with a past medical history of metastatic
renal cell carcinoma to the brain and lungs, who was admitted
with tachycardia, and found to have a hospital acquired
pneumonia.
.
#. Pneumonia: Confirmed on CXR showing a retrocardiac opacity.
Clinically with rhonchorous breath sounds in the setting of
sinus tachycardia.  Likely hospital acquired given residence in
a nursing home.  Per ID consult will continue to manage this as
such with a seven day course of vancomycin, cefepime, and
azithromycin.
.
#. Tachycardia: The patient had sinus tachycardia to the 130s on
admission, which has improved with fluids and antibiotics.
Likely secondary to infection vs. hypovolemia.
.
#. Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma: Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4253**] was consulted
and recommended a slow decadron taper which is detailed in the
discharge plan.  We otherwise continued bactrim prophylaxis, and
keppra.
