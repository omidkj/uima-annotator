History of Present Illness:
This 63WM had a +ETT and was referred for cardiac cath.  He was
found down in his apartment in [**2-15**] and was found to be

stenoses.  He was eventually discharged to rehab.  He was
readmitted to NEBH in [**Month (only) 547**] with increasing pedal edema. An echo
showed an EF of 25-30% and he had a persantine MIBI which showed
reversible lateral and apical ischemia.  He was then transferred
to [**Hospital3 **] for further cardiac and carotid evaluation.

-IDDM : complicated by retinopathy, nephropathy, peripheral
neuropathy
- Stroke:  left frontal CVA [**2-15**]

BEDSIDE SWALLOWING EVALUATION:

HISTORY:
Thank you for consulting on this 63 y/o male with HTN,
hyperlipidemia, DM, and tobacco use referred for a cardiac cath
after an abnormal ETT and decreased LV function. He was found
with 3VD, now s/p CABG x 3 on [**7-3**]. He also had a left ICA stent
placed during this admission. He was extubated [**7-4**]. He had a
recent admission after being found on the floor at home in
[**Month (only) 404**] at which time he was found hypercalcemic in DKA with
lithium toxicity. He also had a left frontal infarct.

PMH includes PVD, carotid disease, CRI, bipolar d/o, glaucoma,
diabetic retinopathy, peripheral neuropathy, s/p tonsillectomy,
GERD

He was advanced to a diet of thin liquids and ground consistency
solids while in the ICU, [**3-13**] poor dentition. Per chart review he
has tolerated well, We were consulted to evaluate for diet
upgrade to tougher solids now that the pt is on the floor.

EVALUATION:
The examination was performed while the patient was seated
upright in the chair on Far 2.

Cognition, language, speech, voice:
Pt was A&O x 3 with fluent language. Speech and voice were wfl,
but initiation of speech and prosody were altered and were slow.
He was able to follow all basic commands.

Teeth: remaining teeth in poor condition - several teeth were
loose or missing

Secretions: wfl in the oral cavity, mild baseline cough / throat
clearing

ORAL MOTOR EXAM:
Symmetrical facial appearance with adequate lip seal and buccal
tone. Tongue was at midline with functional strength and ROM.
Palatal elevation was symmetrical. Gag deferred to maintain
rapport.

SWALLOWING ASSESSMENT:
The pt was seen during lunch with thin liquids (cup, straw,
consecutive), purees, chicken noodle soup, ground meat, crackers
and pills whole with liquid. Oral transit was mildly prolonged
with the cracker only, but oral cavity residue was seen after
any
consistency. He had throat clearing after one bite of ground
meat
and after 2 sips of liquid, but reported it was from phlegm and
the "stent" and denied any sensation of residue or aspiration.
No
overt coughing or changes in vocal quality was observed after
any
consistency. Laryngeal elevation was mildly delayed, but
adequate
to palpation.

SUMMARY / IMPRESSION:
The pt appears to be tolerating the current diet well. While his
dentition is poor, he is able to manage regular consistency
solids and his diet can be upgraded to thin liquids and regular
consistency solids. Pills can be taken whole with liquids
without
difficulty. The pt was observed to have difficulty self-
feeding,
in part [**3-13**] tremor and spilled a good portion of his lunch. He
may benefit from an OT evaluation for possible adaptive devices
available for feeding.

This swallowing pattern correlates to a Dysphagia Outcome
Severity Scale (DOSS) rating of 6, modified independence.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Suggest the pt be upgraded to a diet of thin liquids and
regular consistency solids.

2. Pills whole with thin liquids.

3. Consider OT consult to evaluate for potential adaptive
devices
for feeding.

These recommendations were shared with the patient, nurse and
medical team.

CHEST (PA & LAT)

Reason: evaluate effusion

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
63 year old man s/po CABG
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
evaluate effusion
INDICATION: CABG, effusion. Followup.

CHEST, TWO VIEWS: Cardiac shadow has improved in size. Lung
fields appear clear. However, bilateral posteriorly loculated
pleural effusions are seen, small in size. Right internal
jugular vein line is again identified in the right atrium, and
should be retracted at least 5 cm to be at the cavoatrial
junction. Midline sternotomy wires and vertical staple line
noted.

IMPRESSION:
1. Bilateral small posteriorly loculated pleural effusions.
2. Right internal jugular vein line in right atrium, which
should be retracted.
