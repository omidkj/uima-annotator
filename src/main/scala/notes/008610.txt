HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mrs. [**Known lastname **] is a 40-year-old
female with a complicated past medical history including
multiple abdominal surgeries who was transferred from the
[**Hospital 1558**] Hospital in [**Location (un) 16843**] to the
[**Hospital6 256**] Medical Intensive Care
The patient presented to [**Hospital 16843**] Hospital that morning
with fever, diarrhea and minimal emesis.  She was found in
this hospital to have Klebsiella urinary tract infection and
was started on levofloxacin.  days after transfer, blood
culture grew out yeast for which she was started on
intravenous fluconazole in our Intensive Care Unit.  On the
day of transfer, the patient had subacute worsening of her
was transferred to the [**Hospital6 256**]
on 100% oxygen from a  nonrebreather mask.  She was able to
be weaned down to 5 liters of nasal cannula with minimal
diuresis of negative 1600 cc in the Intensive Care Unit.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  The patient is status post Billroth 2 roux-en-y surgery
and distal gastrectomy for questionable septic ulcer disease.
2.  Afferent limb anastomotic stricture.
3.  Total parental nutrition since one year ago.
4.  Questionable history of inflammatory bowel disease with a
negative work-up.  The patient has been on chronic prednisone
in the past.
5.  Status post appendectomy.
6.  Patient has a history of [**Female First Name (un) **] fungemia.
7.  The patient has osteoporosis with compression fractures
secondary to his steroid use.  The patient requires chronic
pain medication for her compression fractures.
8.  The patient had a line infection in [**2100-11-23**] with
enterococcus Vesalius which was sensitive to vancomycin.
9.  The patient had a history of mild asthma.  She was on
albuterol inhaler as needed.
10. The patient is status post percutaneous vertebroplasty
for her compression fracture in her vertebrae in [**2100-11-23**].
11. The patient had a history of staphylococcus epidermis
bacteremia presumed from her TPN line infection in [**2100-11-23**].  On echocardiogram, she has had no evidence of
vegetations.
12. The patient has interstitial lung disease status post
VATT biopsy.  The etiology of this lung disease is unclear,
though, could be consistent with vasculitis on pathology.  In
the patient's lung biopsy, both cement and bone marrow emboli
were also seen.  The patient is followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in
Pulmonology and was placed on steroids for interstitial lung
disease.
13. The patient has a history of chronic diarrhea and
hypokalemia.
14. Per the patient's outpatient gastrointestinal specialist,
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 8571**], the patient has a post anastomotic stenosis
distal to her gastrectomy site, which has been causing her
nausea and vomiting requiring TPN.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION TO THE [**Hospital6 **]:  Protonix 40 mg po q.d., fluconazole 200 mg
intravenous po q.d., Solu-Medrol 80 mg intravenously t.i.d.,
Levaquin 500 mg po q.d., Fosamax 5 mg po q.d., Tums 500 mg po
t.i.d., Duragesic patch 200 mcg q. 72 hours and TPN.

ALLERGIES:  The patient is allergic to sulfa drugs which
gives her a rash.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives with her husband and
children.  She is a state representative of [**Location (un) 16843**].  Her
husband is a policeman.  The patient has four children.  The
patient has a 20 pack year smoking history and quit four
years ago.  The patient denied any alcohol use.

When reviewing the patient's past medical records, it appears
that the patient is very actively involved in the political
world with her career.  She has left the hospital several
times prior to complete treatment of her medical condition
due to her political obligations.  The patient has also left
the hospital in the past on her prior admission to this
hospital in [**Month (only) 956**] claiming personal emergency, when she in
fact wanted to go to her outpatient [**Month (only) **] doctor
for a stenosis dilatation procedure.  The patient did not
inform her in patient physicians that she was going to
undertake this procedure, neither did she inform her
outpatient gastroenterologist that at this time, she was in
fact bacteremic with Staph epidermis and was under treatment
with intravenous vancomycin and still febrile.

PHYSICAL EXAM ON ADMISSION TO THE MEDICAL INTENSIVE CARE
UNIT:  Temperature was 96.7.  Heart rate was 74.  Blood
pressure 122/63.  Patient was saturating 94% on five liters
by nasal cannula.  General exam revealed a 40-year-old female
sitting up looking comfortable.  Head, eyes, ears, nose and
throat exam revealed moist mucous membranes.  Cardiovascular
exam revealed normal S1, S2, 2/6 systolic ejection murmur at
left upper sternal border.  She had a regular rate and
rhythm.  Her jugular venous pressure was about 8 cm.  Lung
exam revealed bilateral crackles up to apex.  Abdomen exam
revealed an abdomen soft, which was nontender, nondistended
with positive bowel sounds.  Patient has multiple old
surgical scars in her abdomen.  Extremity exam revealed lean
extremity with good pulses and warm.  She had no lower
extremity edema.  The patient had ecchymosis on lateral
aspects of her feet.  She had a PIC line in her left arm.
Neurological exam revealed her pupils were equal and reactive
to light bilaterally.  The patient had intact extraocular
movements.

LABORATORY STUDIES ON ADMISSION:  Revealed a hematocrit of
28.2, white blood cell count of 6.7, platelet count of
218,000.  Her INR was 1.0.  PT of 12.1, PTT of 34.7.
Patient's sodium was 134, potassium of 4.5, chloride 92,
bicarbonate 32, BUN 14, creatinine 0.2.  The patient's
calcium was 8.4, magnesium 1.5 and phosphate of 4.3.

COURSE IN HOSPITAL:  The patient was transferred to [**Hospital6 1760**] with question of new onset
hypoxia.  The patient was easily weaned from a nonrebreather
mask to five liters by nasal cannula saturating at 94% after
arrival with further diuresis of 1600 cc of fluid, the
patient was able to be weaned down to three liters by nasal
cannula.  Upon transfer, the patient was known to have 1/4
bottles growing budding yeast.  Because of this, the patient
was placed on 400 mg of intravenous fluconazole q.d.  New
blood cultures, urine and sputum cultures were obtained.  The
patient was continued on levofloxacin for a positive urine
culture from the outside hospital showing Klebsiella and
Citrobacter freundii.  The patient was kept on her inhalers
for her pulmonary disease of unclear etiology.  She was
maintained on her pain medication for her compression
fracture.  Initially, on admission, the patient was given
standing doses of Solu-Medrol for stress dose steroids.

The patient was deemed stable enough to be transferred to the
floor soon after her arrival to the Medical Intensive Care
Unit.  Due to the lack of beds, the patient remained in the
Medical Intensive Care Unit until [**2101-3-17**].  During
this time, her right arm PICC line was discontinued and the
patient was treated with only peripheral intravenous
catheters.  The patient's TPN was stopped due to her active
high grade fungemia.  At this time, the patient was noted to
be able to tolerate both pills and regular diet by mouth with
minimal emesis.  The question arose then, why the patient had
required total parental nutrition for the past year.  After
reviewing the patient's old records in this hospital, as well
as talking to [**Year (4 digits) **], Pulmonology, Endocrinology
and other physicians who knew the patient and had taken care
of her before, it appeared that the patient has an active
political career and had refused multiple times the placement
of a J tube due to cosmesis.  She apparently also carries a
diagnosis of self tapering her prednisone, which was not
recommended by her physician for likely cosmesis causes as
well.

The [**Year (4 digits) **], Pulmonary, and Infectious Disease
Services were consulted after the patient's arrival to the
floor.  The patient was switched to intravenous amphotericin
on [**2101-3-17**] when further species in her culture
revealed that the patient grew fluconazole resis
