N/V/D, hyperglycemia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none


History of Present Illness:
73F with DM1, h/o DKA in past, HTN, COPD, depression who
presented to ED with N/V/D. Pt reports feeling her usual self
until after dinner yesterday (frozen dinner, no seafood) when
she developed nausea, emesis, and diarrhea, all of which lasted
through the night into the morning. Emesis was initially of her
supper contents then mainly dry heaves and w/o any blood.
Diarrhea was brown w/o blood or black stool. Pt was unable to
tolerate much PO intake during this time. Pt also developed
epigastric pain with the emesis.
<br>
Pt reports that her FS glucoses at home were in the 500 range
all day yesterday, which she states is NOT unusual for her. Her
FS glucose usually ranges in the 200-300s. Lowest value that pt
remembers in the past several weeks is in the high 100s. Today,
pt took her usual 20U glargine at ~noontime but did not take ANY
Humalog SS (despite the FS glucoses in the 500s) because she
states that she has been instructed not to take Humalog unless
she can eat food (which she could not today due to nausea).
<br>
Per OMR and [**Last Name (un) **] notes, pt has had very poorly controlled
sugars x years, with most recent A1c of 13.8%. Pt reports being
in the hospital with DKA many times in the past, most recently
in [**2115-6-26**].
<br>
In ED, serum glucose 1142, bicarb 12, AG 33 so she was started
on IVF and insulin drip. K+ was initially 6.7 (and pt rec'd Ca++
gluconate) but trended down to 4.7 and 4.3 with insulin.
<br>
Denies headache, URI Sx, sore throat, SOB, chest pain, palpit,
or urinary Sx. Has chronic cough, currently unchanged.

Brief Hospital Course:
73 yo F with DM-I (x30 yrs) who was admitted with DKA (gluc
1142, HCO3 12, AG 33) and acute renal failure due to poor
compliance with her insulin regimen.  She fears the low BS's and
she does not use her humalog regularly.  her baseline HbA1c =
13.8%.  No infectious cause for her DKA was found.  Given her
poor insulin compliance, her DKA was felt to be due to lack of
insulin.  She was hydrated, started on an insulin drip, and
admitted to the intensive care unit.  Her renal failure quickly
resolved, and her anion gap closed as well.  She was seen by the
[**Last Name (un) **] Diabetes Consult [**Last Name (un) 12003**], and restarted on Glargine.  She
has had VNA in the past and refused VNA on this admission.  She
agrees to follow the sliding scale of humalog which starts with
2 units for a FSBS of 151-200 and increases by 2 units every 50
points.  This are her meal-time doses.  At night, her sliding
scale starts with 2 units for a FSBS of 251-300.
.
She was also noted to have a bone density study that revealed
osteoporosis, and she was discharegd on calcium carbonate 500 mg
TID with meals, Vitamin D 800 units daily, and Fosamax 70 mg
once weekly.  She will follow-up with her endocrinologist within
7-10 days.
