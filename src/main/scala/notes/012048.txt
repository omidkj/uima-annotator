Radiology:
Hip films:
IMPRESSION: Complete comminuted fracture through the right
greater
trochanter.

Endoscopy:
Impression: Esophagitis
No blood or lesions noted in stomach.
Duodenal ulcer (injection, endoclip)
Otherwise normal EGD to second part of the duodenum
Recommendations: Source of melena appears to be duodenal bulb
ulcer with adherent clot. Injection and endoclip placed.
Aggressive manipulation of clot not performed as stated above.
Recommend continued ICU close monitoring, NPO, PPI gtt, hold
anticoagulation. If recurrent significant bleed with likely
require IR intervention.


Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a [**Age over 90 **] year old woman with known critical aortic
stenosis, CKD, CAD s/p CABG, and hypothyroidism who was
initially admitted to the Orthopaedic Surgery Trauma service
after a fall in which she sustained a right intertrochanteric
hip fracture while helping her husband get dressed. Her hospital
course was significant for peri-operative cardiac arrest and
hypotension and later a GI bleeding episode requiring ICU stay.

During the orthopedic initial course: The patient was taken to
the Operating Room on [**2133-4-18**] with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] to undergo open
reduction and internal fixation of the right hip with a
Trochanteric Fixation Nail.  Her intraoperative course was
complicated by an episode of hypotension during the anesthesia
induction period.  Please see Operative Report for full details.
 Post-operatively, the patient was taken to the recovery room
before being transferred to the floor.

On POD#1, she was transfused 2 units of packed red blood cells
for acute blood loss anemia.  She was also noted to be confused
that day, and the Geriatrics service was consulted for acute
mental status changes.  A CT scan of the head was recommended to
evaluate for an acute bleed; this study was found to be negative
for an acute intracranial process, but did show age-related
involution and chronic small vessel ischemic disease.

The patient's mental status improved over the next few days.
She continued to work with Physical Therapy and made [**Last Name (STitle) 4374**]
progress.  She was transfused 2 units of pRBCs on [**2133-4-21**], again
for acute blood loss anemia, as well as 1 unit of FFP.

On the morning of POD#5, the patient was noted to become acutely
hypotensive to 70s/40s in the setting of appearing pale and
complaining of lightheadedness, dizziness, and palpitations.
Her hematocrit had decreased from 29.1 the day before to 24.3;
upon being rechecked 3 hours later, the hematocrit had decreased
to 21.7.  The patient was ordered for STAT packed red blood cell
transfusion, and in the interim she received crystalloid for
volume resuscitation.  A Trigger was called, and STAT EKG, CXR,
and cardiac enzymes were ordered.  The Medicine and Cardiology
services were contact[**Name (NI) **] and presented urgently to see the
patient.  The ICU was also contact[**Name (NI) **] given concern for acute
blood loss anemia.  Her right (operative) thigh remained soft
and did not appear to be full or acutely swollen.

The patient was transferred to the T/SICU, shortly after which
time she produced a large amount of melena of approximately 1
liter.  The GI service was consulted urgently, and EGD was
performed that was significant for severe erosive gastritis and
a duodenal ulcer.  Please see report for full details.  She was
then transferred to the MICU for further evaluation and
management of her GI bleed.

MICU & Floor Course:

# GIB: Upon admission to the MICU she underwent EGD, which
showed erosive esophagitis and multiple duodenal ulcers, which
were not intervened upon. Her Lovenox was discontinued and she
was placed on Heparin SQ and pneumoboots for DVT ppx. She was
transfused a total of 2 units pRBCs over the course of 48 hours.
