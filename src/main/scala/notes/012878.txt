History of Present Illness:
58 yo M recently diagnosed with myeloproliferative/
myelodysplastic syndrome overlap syndrome, R thigh wound s/p
failed/reversed skin graft, presents with fever and SOB. He has
been seen [**2148-7-17**] in clinic with WBC 79.000 16% blast. He has
been receiving hydrea 2 g/da and low dose ARA c for the last 3
days.
Per clinic notes, he had an episode of shortness of breath with
wheezing in clinic, receive albuterol and apparently felt
better. he also had an echo that showed LVEF >75%, and small
pericardial effusion, but no tamponade physicology. PA pressures
24 mm HG
.
Patient went home and at about 1 am on [**2148-7-18**], he presented to
the ED with increasing shortness of breath and fever.
He states that he has been getting episodes of "indigestion"
with some shortness of breath everytime after lunch but patient
is unclear how long they last. He feels that this time is worse,
and he could actually here himself wheezing. He refers cough
with withish sputum over the last 2 days. In the ED, patient
receieved nebs and was started on antibiotics
cefepime-vancomycin.  At some point during his ED stay, there
was a concern for a septic component, his blood pressure went
down to 85/46, that he responded well to IV fluids. Chest x ray
revela fluid in the fissure and a sm right effusion. Received
about 5.7 L of IV fluids in the ed. lactate 4.3 that later on
trended down to 2.1.  His sats improved with 5L nasal cannula to
93-94 and then to 97-98 on 40% ventury and transfered to the [**Date Range 3242**]
floor.
.
During the day on [**Date Range 3242**] floor, patient contiued to be tachypnea
with RR in 30's, sat 98% on VM. (40-50%). Was started on Hydrea,
and continued on Vanc, Cefipime, azithromycin for ? of CAP. (Was
on bactrium PCP prophylaxis as outpatient). Receieved Lasix 20mg
IV xTT, with 350cc then an additional 350cc at 7:30pm (patient
refusing foley placement).and Atrovent/albuterol with minimal
improvement in SOB. Of note, patients weight was 200 ~4 weeks
ago and currenrly 223#. Patient receieved 1 U PRBC's on [**2148-7-17**]
per OMR
.
Of note, pt had prior admission to [**Date Range 3242**] service/[**Hospital Unit Name 153**] earlier in
[**Month (only) 116**]. During this admission, he had 2 hypoxic episodes, with
desaturations to 85% on room air, and 4 liter oxygen
requirement. He was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for concerns of
respiratory demise from leukostasis. Respiratory status
stabilized and did not require intubation. After a short stay in
ICU, patient was transferred back to [**Hospital Unit Name 3242**] floor on nasal canula
oxygen. Pulmonology was consulted and felt that hypoxia was
likely from fluid overload based on Chest CT
findings. Patient's symptoms improved with diuresis and was
weaned off supplemental oxygen.
.
Currently, the patient states, "I just need some sleep, I just
can't get my breath."
.
Denies any CP, N/V, + LE edema and PNA and 4 pillow orthopnea.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 58 y/o with MDS/MPS admitted in setting of rising WBC count
over past week and fevers, and profound SOB.
.
# Respiratory Distress:  Patient was transferred from the [**Name10 (NameIs) 3242**]
service to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for persistent respiratory
distress/increased work of breathing with RR in 30's and satting
98% on 50% oxygen by ventimask.  Of note, patient has had two
previous hypoxic episodes in [**Month (only) 116**], both of which required
transfer to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] and were eventually attributed to volume
overload and resolved with diuresis.  On this occaision, patient
was admitted with a hypoxic episode, with fevers, in the setting
of a 23 pound weight gain over the two weeks prior to admission.
 He had 2+ pitting pedal edema, crackles on lung exam and CXR
with increase septal markings consistent with pulmonary edema
and hyperinflation suggestive of emphysema.  Patient was
transiently supported on BiPAP (less than 1 hour) and started on
continuous nebulizers with improvement in his respiratory rate
and exam.  He was transitioned to supplemental oxygen by face
mask and diuresed with lasix.  He was also started on
Vanco/Cefapime/Azithro for presumptive PNA as well as daily IV
lasix.  He continued to receive regular nebulizers and steroids
to treat COPD.  His oxygen requirement decreased steadily until
he was maintaining his O2 sats on nasal cannula.
.
Patient was transfered to the floor on 6 L nasal canula. Chest
CT was done on ([**2148-7-22**]) arrival to the floor and showed
improvement in previous lower lobe pneumonia, but worsening of
right upper lobe ground- glass alveolar opacities and
consolidation. New lung nodules elsewhere were also noted.
Pulmonary was consulted. Voriconazole was started. BAL was
perfomed and all cultures were negative. Repeat Chest Ct was
perfomed on [**2148-7-29**] that showed interval improvment of the
infiltrates.
After continuing nebs, steroids and antibiotics his o2
requirment trended dow
