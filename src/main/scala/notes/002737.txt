Brief Hospital Course:
Briefly, Mr. [**Known lastname **] is an 82 year old man with h/o DM, colon ca
s/p transverse colectomy in [**2122**] c/b incisional hernia/poor
wound healing, advanced dementia, and HTN. He presented from his
[**Hospital1 1501**] with fever, abd distention, vomiting X2, and lethargy. Pt is
a resident of [**Location 10059**] Nursing Centre. He had 3 days of cold
symptoms, 2 days of constipation and was noted to have decreased
appetite and overall depressed functioning compared to baseline.
On [**5-14**], he had a fever to 100.8 and emesis of yellowish
nonbloody material X2 which led to transfer to ED.
In the ED, initial vs were: T 106.1 P 111 BP 161/82 R 18 94%O2on
RA, Patient was given 1 g Vanc, 4.5 g Zosyn, Tylenol 1g and 2
litres of NS. Ice packs were placed to cool him. He was admitted
to MICU for consideration of artic sun for cooling.
However, since in MICU, remained afebrile. Hemodynamically
stable. MS appears to be at his baseline. Was found to have UTI
so Abx changed to CTx. CXR was negative for PNA. Blood cx
negative. He got total 3L IVFs in ICU and  ER. Given his prompt
improvement he was transfered out of MICU next day. On the floor
he continued to do well. MS appeared at baseline, occasional
sundowning but was redirectable. Abx were converted to cefpodox
for UCx showing pansensitive enterobacter, for total 10day
course. He had ARF on CKD on admission, which resolved back to
baseline 1.2 with fluids. He developed mild pulm edema after 3L
on admission, but this improved when resuming his home dose of
lasix. As for his constipation, he had several BMs here that
were well formed. There were no other issues. Discharged back to
[**Hospital1 1501**].

See progress note below for details of plan:

82 year old man with h/o DM, colon ca s/p transverse colectomy
in [**2122**] c/b incisional hernia/poor wound healing, advanced
dementia, chronic dCHF and HTN. He presented from his [**Hospital1 1501**] with
fever and lethargy and is found to have enterobacter UTI.
Transfered to floor after brief MICU stable. Doing well and
ready for t/f back to [**Hospital1 1501**].
.
UTI, bacterial: Temp 106 reported in ED on admission (?error,
may be was 100.6) but otherwise has been stable hemodynamically.
Mild delirium that has resolved. Recieved empiric vanc/zosyn in
ER, then CTX X3 days, will change to cefpodox on discharge per
sensitivities of Enterobacter for 7day course. Blood Cx NTD.
foley placed in ER and removed next day. Other infectious w/u
with CXR (given URI symptoms) was negative.
.
ARF on CKD III: Recent baseline is 1.3 since 3/[**2124**]. Was 1.6 on
admission. Improved to 1.2 after fluids and treatment of UTI
which was stable on discharge.
.
Bicytopenia: hct and plt all lower this admission than previous.
Unclear what hct baseline is (prior ones are during GIB and post
op). Repeat HCT here were stable around 28-29 after fluids.  Plt
in past 300s, now 160s on admission for few days, likely [**2-29**]
infection. Repeat plt improved to 220s on discharge. Coags were
okay.
.
Acute Delirium in setting of advanced dementia: report of
increased lethargy on admission, which is likely due to UTI.
This resolved by next day. He appeared to be at baseline. He had
occ episodes of agitation which may be sundowning rather than
delirium. He did not need any medications.
.
Colon cancer: s/p resection. No abdominal pain.  ventral hernia
stable but pt has chronic abd stage II ulceration/wound. Seen by
wound care who provided some recs which will be relayed to [**Hospital1 1501**].
.
Chronic dCHF: Did develop mild pulm edema on CXR after fluids
with some wheezing. This improved once his lasix was resumed and
he did very well, never required O2. Kept on his BB/CCB.
.
DMII: SSI. resumed glipizide. Was on SSI here but resumed his
insulin regimen on discharge. kept on statin.
.
HTN: stable on prior doses of verapamil, lopressor, lasix
.
GERD and h/o UGIB: Continued on PPI.
.
Constipation: resolved with bowel regimen. kept on this on
discharge.
.
Dispo/Code: DNR/DNI, POA is [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) 79682**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 70408**],
[**Telephone/Fax (1) 79684**]. Updated on admission/discharge. Will d/c back to
