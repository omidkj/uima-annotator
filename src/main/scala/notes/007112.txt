[**2119-11-5**] Blood Culture, Routine (Final [**2119-11-11**]):
VIRIDANS STREPTOCOCCI.    ISOLATED FROM ONE SET ONLY.
ECH ([**2119-11-10**]):Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
preserved global and regional biventricular systolic function.
Mild aortic valve sclerosis. Valsalva inducible LVOT gradient.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2119-10-20**], the
severity of mitral regurgitation is reduced and no resting LVOT
gradient is now identified.


Brief Hospital Course:
On [**2119-10-10**], he underwent renal transplant into left iliac fossa.
Surgeon was Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 816**]. Ureteral stent and JP were placed.
Intraop, urine was produced. Urine output was 1 liter for the
day 0. Urine output gradually decreased and fluid replacements
were stopped as urine output diminished. Creatinine increased.
Hct decreased to 22.5 on postop day 4. A renal duplex was done
to assess for perinephric hematoma. Findings demonstrated new
hydronephrosis of the transplant kidney, mildly elevated
resistive indices, unchanged, from immediately postop. There was
a small 3.5-cm perinephric fluid collection anterior and
inferior to the transplant kidney. PRBC were given.

On [**10-14**] the RIJ TL line was exchanged for an HD line; HD was
started for delayed graft function. Left leg was noted to be
larger than the right leg. LENIS were done noting partial
occlusive LLE SFV & calf v thrombi.

He was transferred to SICU on [**10-15**] after MRV pf pelvis
demonstrated large heterogeneous fluid collection (likely
hematoma) medial and posterior to the transplant kidney
extending into pelvis w/ bladder compression (7.2 x 17.6 x 7.4
cm).  The left common iliac and external iliac veins demonstrate
luminal compression by the pelvic collection but are noted to
have flow and left common femoral vein was of normal caliber and
had flow.

Transplant renal u/s showed no hydronephrosis; increased size of
perinephric collections from [**2119-10-14**] along w/ high resistance
flow in all of the intraparenchymal arteries likely due to the
presence of large collection.  The main renal vein was patent.
LLE duplex confirmed extremely slow flow seen within the vessels
of the left leg, but no deep vein thrombosis was demonstrated.
He was transfused with 1 unit PRBCs for drop in Hct to 24.8 from
28.3. Dialysis was performed.

On [**10-17**], he was dialyzed, but became hypotensive post HD. Got 1U
pRBCs for hypotension with MAPs of 50s. Overnight did not
tolerate po's and vomited brownish content with +occult blood.
At 3 am dropped BP, with adequate response to NS bolus

On [**10-18**]: Patient refused to go to the OR for washout of
hematoma. He experienced an acute change in mental status (more
confused, refusing PO, tugging at dressings/lines). Psychiatry
consult deemed him not competent to make his own medical
decisions at this time and recommended haldol for agitation and
not benzos. CT head w/o contrast did not demonstrate new acute
cerebral insults.  Neurology consult recommended seroquel for
severe agitation.  Renal service recommended an echocardiogram
to eval his persistent hypotension.  Transplant renal u/s showed
no change from prior.

On [**2119-10-19**] he was taken to the OR for evacuation of hematoma
(~2L), no active source of bleeding observed. Surgeon was Dr.
[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].

[**10-20**]: Transfused 1 unit PRBC, R PICC ordered. Insulin adjusted
[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) **]. Cortisol stimulation test results were not overly
impressive and so no stress dose steroids were administered
(cortisol level: pre-cosyntropin 27.2, 30-min 37.6; 60-min
39.9).  Echo returned w/ hyperdynamic LV with outflow
obstruction. Metoprolol 5mg IV Q6H started. Tacro [**1-20**]. Hematoma
from evacuation growing sparse enterococcus IV linezolid was
started for 7 days. Agitated and refusing meds and PICC.

[**10-21**]: CVVH filter clogged. Holding on CVVH until Monday for HD.
Patient agreed for right PICC line. Overnight with BS in the
450s, started on insul
