.
EKG:
Sinus rhythm and frequent ventricular ectopy. Diffuse low
voltage. Compared to the previous tracing of [**2147-12-7**] the sinus
rate and the frequency of ventricular ectopy have increased.
Otherwise, no apparent diagnostic interim change.
.
CXR [**1-15**]:
IMPRESSION: Bilateral lung base opacity concerning for pneumonia

.
CXR [**1-16**]:
IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**1-15**]:
The patient would not cooperate for standard positioning.
Lateral aspect of the left hemithorax is excluded from the
examination. Mild opacification at the base of the right lung
could be due to recent aspiration. Abnormality is more severe at
the left lung base, more concerning for pneumonia. Pleural
effusion on the right is minimal. Left cannot be assessed
because the sulcus is excluded from the examination but there is
no large left pleural effusion. Right PIC line ends close to the
superior cavoatrial junction. Heart is not enlarged. No
pneumothorax along the imaged pleural surfaces.
.
[**1-17**]: CXR
Comparison is made with prior study, [**1-16**].
The lateral base of the left hemithorax was not included on the
film.
Bibasilar consolidations left greater than right are stable.
There are no new lung abnormalities. Cardiomediastinal contours
are unchanged
