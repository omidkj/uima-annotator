Admission Date:  [**2174-1-2**]     Discharge Date:  [**2174-1-3**]


Service:  CCU

ADMISSION DIAGNOSIS:  Cardiac arrhythmia.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 88 year old
male with coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure,
ejection fraction of 35%, history of ventricular tachycardia,
status post ICD implantation about two months ago, who has
been complaining of frequent ICD firing.  He comes in today
because the device had fired three times the morning prior to
admission and five times the morning of admission.  He had
complained of no chest pain or shortness of breath.  He does
have some occasional light-headedness but none the last two
days.  He initially presented with tolerated VT in [**2173-5-4**]. He
had an unsuccessful attempt at VT ablation in [**9-5**], and had an
ICD placed on [**2173-12-3**]. He has also been on Amiodarone, however,
at the beginning of [**Month (only) **], the Amiodarone was discontinued by
his outpatient cardiologist due to recurrent VT which failed ATP.
He was then switched to Mexiletine with plans for possible
initiation of dofetilide three months down the road.  During
[**Month (only) **], he had two episodes of single firing of the ICD to
terminate the ventricular tachycardia.  However, as earlier said,
the last two days, he experienced eight episodes of firing.  ICD
was interrogated out of the hospital and showed appropriate
firing. Currently, the patient is completely asymptomatic with no
headache, visual changes, light-headedness, shortness of breath,
chest pain, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting or diarrhea.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Coronary artery disease, latest catheterization showing
no left main disease, 50% left anterior descending, 70% right
coronary artery, and his left circumflex has been recently
stented.
2.  Congestive heart failure. Echocardiogram in [**2173-5-4**],
reveals ejection fraction of 35%.
3.  Gastritis diagnosed by esophagogastroduodenoscopy though
the patient has been taking proton pump inhibitor only
sporadically for this.
4.  Benign prostatic hypertrophy.
5. Recurrent ventricular tachycardia as above.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1.  Lipitor 10 mg once daily.
2.  Plavix 75 mg p.o. once daily.
3.  Magnesium.
4.  Flomax 0.4 mg.

Of note, the patient is not taking Aspirin on a daily basis
and only occasionally is taking Protonix.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  He is widowed and lives independently in a
house.  He has family in the area.  He has about 100 pack
year smoking but quit about thirty years ago.  No alcohol use
for the last ten years or so.

FAMILY HISTORY:  No coronary artery disease or arrhythmias.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature is 97.8, heart rate 75,
blood pressure 166/68, respiratory rate 14, oxygen saturation
96 to 98% on two liters.  Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat
examination - The oropharynx is clear.  The neck showed no
jugular venous distention, thyroid within normal limits.
Lungs showed good air movement, clear to auscultation
bilaterally.  Cardiovascular - S1 and S2 with no murmurs,
rubs or gallops.  Abdomen is soft, nontender, nondistended,
normoactive bowel sounds.  Extremities reveal no edema.  Of
note, the patient has amputation of the right arm secondary
to a gunshot wound.

LABORATORY DATA:  His laboratories are within normal limits.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the CCU for
monitoring.  There was no ventricular tachycardia during his
stay here.  He was started on low dose beta blocker.  On the
following day, he was taken to the Electrophysiology
Laboratory where noninvasive programmed stimulation was
performed.  The clinical ventricular tachycardia was induced
several times, and terminated by antitachycardia pacing
reproducibly by the ICD after reprogramming to a ramp ATP
protocol was performed.  The patient remained stable following
the procedure and is being discharged to home.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Same as prior to admission,
ambulatory and able to perform activities of daily living.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  To home.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Coronary artery disease.
2.  Congestive heart failure.
3.  Ventricular tachycardia, status post ICD.
4.  Gastritis.
5.  Benign prostatic hypertrophy.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
1.  Aspirin 81 mg p.o. once daily.
2.  Toprol XL 25 mg p.o. once daily.
3.  Lipitor 10 mg p.o. once daily.
4.  Flomax 0.4 mg p.o. once daily.
5.  Plavix 75 mg p.o. once daily.
Of note, the patient does not need to be on antiarrhtyhmic
medicaiton for now.  If he has frequent VT or recurrent shocks
dofetilide can be considered in the future once he has been off
amiodarone longer.  He will follow- up with his primary
cardiologist regarding initiation of ace inhibitor in the
future as well as the recent finding of a TSH of 10.0 which
will probably need to be rechecked in the context of
amiodarone having been discontinued.  Finally he should follow up
with the [**Hospital 3941**] clinic at [**Hospital1 18**] in 1 month.
