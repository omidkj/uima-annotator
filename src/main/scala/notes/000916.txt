acute renal failure

History of Present Illness:
52 year old male who presented to an OSH with SOB that had
started about 2 weeks ago and gradually worsened, constant in
nature.  This occurred in the setting of severe right hallux
pain from an ulcer related to his Buerger's disease; he had
treated himself with up to 15 tablets of ibuprofen per day for
approximately 1-2 weeks when he went to see his podiatrist who
felt he was quite ill and advised him to report to the ED.  He
had also been having 20 BMs/day for several days, and was
lightheaeded.
At the OSH, he was found to be hypotensive, hypoxic, profoundly
acidemic (ph 6.9), and in acute renal failure.  He was intubated
and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] where he was sent to the MICU and given
agressive hydration with bicarbonate.  He responded rapidly and
well with a dramatic improvement in his renal function and
acid/base status.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 62 year old gentleman, HTN, gout, PCV, presents with acute
renal failure with significant acidemia.

1.)Acute renal failure -- In reviewing the clinical history,
urine sediment, FeNa, and rapid response to fluid hydration, Mr.
[**Known lastname 3527**] acute renal failure was most likely from severe
volume depletion and NSAID abuse.  The possibility of ATN was
entertained, given the severity of the renal function decrement
and exorbitant NSAID use, but given the rapid response to
fluids, this appeared less likely.  As previously mentioned, Mr.
[**Known lastname 3527**] renal function rapidly improved to baseline function
within the first forty-eight hours of admission in response to
aggresive fluid hydration and remained there throughout the
remainder of his hospital stay.

2.)Anion gap metabolic acidosis -- With his highly elevated BUN
and Cr, this was felt to be a uremic acidosis.  Other
possibilities included lactic, alcholic, starvation, or toxic
ingestion, yet these all proved incorrect.  His acid-base status
quickly normalized with IV bicarbonate and improving renal
function and remained as such for the ensuing few days of his
admission.

3.)Hypotension -- Without an elevated lactate, fever,
tachycardia, ECG changes, or
persistently elevated cardiac enzymes, Mr. [**Known lastname 3527**]
hypotension was attributed to severe volume depletion,
corroborated by his excellent reponse to hydration.  He remained
normotensive off all pressors beginning twenty-four hours into
his stay.

4.)Leukocytosis -- With an otherwise negative ID work-up, this
lab finding was felt to be due to both severe hemoconcentration
and, potentially, a C. difficile infection, as described below.
He was treated for this, with a WBC that normalized
and remained stable 72 hours prior to discharge.  Urine, blood,
and sputum cx's remained negative, as did C. diff toxin assay.

5.)Thrombocytosis -- In discussion with the PCP, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Known lastname 3517**]
has a history of essential thrombocytosis and has been
intermittently followed by a hematologist as an outpatient.  The
acute elevation, up to 1000, was probably due to an acute phase
reaction; once this resolved, his platelet count declined but
still remained slightly elevated.  This was discussed with his
PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) 1159**], who said that he would arrange for Mr. [**Known lastname 3517**]
to again be seen by hematology.

6.)Right Hallux -- During the admission, after his acute issues
had resolved, Mr. [**Known lastname 3517**] continued to note right toe pain.
Podiatry was evaluated for a possible paronychial infection,
which they agreed with; they debrided the ulcer and drained the
pus from around the nail, providing significant relief.  Mr.
[**Known lastname 3517**] will see his podiatrist in one to two weeks.
