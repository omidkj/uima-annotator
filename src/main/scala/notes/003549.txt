Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5266**]
Chief Complaint:
Worsening lower extremity

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
-

History of Present Illness:
This is a [**Age over 90 **] y/o female with h/o lower extremity and no known
cardiac history who presents today after her visiting nurse
noticed that she had worsening lower extremity edema and
crackles on exam. The patient denies any CP/SOB, abd pain,
fever/chills, weakness/numbness.
In the ED the patient had an O2 sat 93-95% on RA. A chest x-ray
was done which showed enlargement of the heart, small effusion
at the right base, no overt signs of failure, and clear lungs.
Labs were notable for elevated Cr of 1.6. (Baseline 1.1), BNP
[**Numeric Identifier 24310**] and elevated trop .44(in the setting of new afib and ARF).
An EKG down showed low voltage and afib.

Echo [**2121-10-10**]
Conclusions:
The left and right atrium is moderately dilated.No left atrial
mass/thrombus  seen (best excluded by transesophageal
echocardiography). There is mild  symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is  moderate global
left ventricular hypokinesis. The right ventricular cavity is
markedly dilated with moderate global free wall hypokinesis.
[Intrinsic right  ventricular systolic function may be more
depressed given the severity of  tricuspid regurgitation.] There
is abnormal diastolic septal motion/position consistent with
right ventricular volume overload. The aortic valve leaflets
are moderately thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis.
Mild (1+) aortic  regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild  (1+) mitral regurgitation
is seen. At least moderate [2+] tricuspid  regurgitation is
seen. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
.
IMPRESSION: Marked right ventricular cavity enlargement with
systolic
dysfunction. Pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. Mild aortic

regurgitation. At least moderate tricuspid regurgitation.
.

Chest X-ray
IMPRESSION: AP chest reviewed in conjunction with a CT scan
[**2121-10-11**].

Moderate-sized right pleural effusion is slightly larger, but
lungs are clear. Heart and right pulmonary artery remain
substantially enlarged. Tiny left pleural effusion may be
present, but not appreciably changed. No pneumothorax.


Brief Hospital Course:
This is a [**Age over 90 **] y/o female with a history of hypothyroidism who
presented to the hospital with worsening lower extremity edema
and new onset atrial fibrillation.  The pt was found to have
chronic pulmonary embolisms on imaging, right heart failure on
TTE, and hematemesis on [**10-20**] requiring MICU transfer.  The pt
returned to the floor on [**10-22**].
.
Her hospital course is as follows;
.
1. Rhythm: New Onset Afib :
Upon admission, an EKG was done and the patient was found to be
in atrial fibrillation.  The time frame for which the patient
had been in atrial fibrillation was unclear. With the concern
that she may have a thrombus, she was anti-coagulated with
heparin.

It is important to note that the patient has a history of
hypothyroidism and was being treated with levoxyl.  A TSH level
was checked to determine whether or not the patient now had
hyperthyroidism causing her atrial fibrillation.  The TSH level
was normal at 2.6.
.
Anticoagulation was later held because of the patient's
hematemesis; the pt was also felt to be a fall risk.  The pt was
started on low dose digoxin prior to discharge to help with
cardiac output and rate control.
.
2. Congestive heart failure:
The patient had an elevated BNP of [**Numeric Identifier 7923**] on admission. The
patient also had an elevated troponin on admission of 0.44.
This troponin leak was attibruted to her congestive heart
failure/demand ischemia and her poor renal function. The initial
plan of management was to diurese that patient.  An ECHO was
done which showed marked right ventricular cavity enlargment and
EF of 30%.   Due to the patient's decompensated right heart
function and thus obvious preload dependency, she was cautiously
diuresed.  The pt was initially continued on lopressor 12.5 mg
po bid, however this was held given the pts GI bleed and low BP
prior to discharge.  The pt was started on low dose digoxin
0.0625 mg po qd prior to discharge.
.
3. Pulmonary Embolism
With depressed right ventricular function, CT-A was performed to
rule out a pulmonary embolism.  CT-A  was consistent with
chronic pulmonary embolism.   D-dimer was 1177. Lower extremity
dopplers were negative. Due to the patient's history of
hematuria while previously on heparin, she was place on a
non-aggressive heparin sliding scale.
.
Given her frail condition and episode of hematemesis, the risk
to benefit of anticoagulation was greater.
.
3. Lower extremity edema
Lower extremity dopplers were obtained and were negative.
Attributing her edema to her congestive heart failure, the
decision was made to cautiously diurese the patient.  The
concern stemmed from the fact that she was preload dependent.
The pt was not diuresed for several day prior to discharge given
that she was hypotensive.
.
4. ARF
Due to her congestive heart failure, the patient was unable to
maintain forward flow to adequatly perfuse her kidneys. Her
creatinine was elevated at 1.6 on admission and it increased to
1.9. The pts Creatinine was back down to 1.1 at discharge.
.
5. Hypoxia
Throughout her course the patient would have brief episodes of
hypoxia.  With minimal exertion her oxygen saturation would fall
to the mid-80%.  During these episodes she was place on a 100%
non-rebreather and her 02sats would improve to the mid-90s. The
patient was later transitioned to a  2L nasal cannula where she
maintained O2 sats in the high 90s. Chest X-ray was consistent
with congestive heart failure.
.
6. Hematemesis
The patient's course was later complicated by a hematemesis.
The patient vomited 200cc on [**10-20**], she became tacchycardic to
the 120 and hypotensive w/ SBPs  in the 80s. Her Hct dropped
from 33 to 29 after hematemesis on [**10-20**].  Pt was given FFP/1U
PRBC and started on Protonix gtt on [**10-20**], transferred to MICU,
and GI was consulted.  She was managed conservatively with PPI
gtt and reversal of coagulopathy with Vit K and FFP (limited
amount of FFP due to CHF and tenuous volume status).  Pt s/p 1U
FFP [**10-21**] and 10 mg Vit K SC.  GI did not perform EGD given the
pts elevated INR and multiple comorbidities.  The pt returned to
the floor on [**10-22**], and she was started on Protonix 40 mg IV bid.
 This was changed to po prior to discharge.
.
7. Osteoarthritis
The patient's pain was controlled with Tramadol.  However this
was later discontinued when the patient was found lethargic one
morning.
.
8. Change in mental status
On [**2121-10-17**] the patient was found to be lethargic.  The patient's
INR was 2.9. A head CT ruled out any intracranial hemorrage.
The risk to benefit of anticoagulation was greater.  For this
reason the patient's anticoagulation was stopped.
.
9. Anemia:  On admission, pt had a hct of 40.  The
