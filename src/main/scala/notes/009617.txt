History of Present Illness:
The pt. is an 81 year-old gentleman with NSCLC diagnosed in
[**2134-9-29**] s/p combination radiation and chemotherapy (with
carboplatin and taxol, last dose in mid-[**Month (only) 1096**]) who presented
to the ED complaining of severe dyspnea on exertion for the past
week PTA.  The pt. stated that he becomes short of breath when
he walks approximately 10 feet which is a change from his
baseline.  He has also noticed associated weakness, fatigue and
decreased oral intake secondary to loss of appetite.  He was
evaluated by his radiation oncologist who noted that he
desaturated to ~90% on room air with any exertion and was
advised to report to the ED to rule-out pulomary embolus.  On
presentation, the pt. denied nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain,
chest pain, lightheadedness or dizziness, fever, chills, BPBPR,
or any changes in his bowel or bladder habits. He stated that he
has been constipated since beginning chemotherapy.

In the ED, his vital signs were T: 98.7F, P: 64, R: 24, BP:
84/45, SaO2: 100% on 4liters via nasal cannula.  He received 5
liters of normal saline with minimal response in his blood
pressure.  Accordingly a MICU evaluation was performed and the
pt. was judged to be appropriate for MICU based on the need for
pressors.  In the ED, the pt. also received IV levofloxacin,
metronidazole, and ceftazadime for pneumonia.

Pertinent Results:
CTA Chest:
-No  pulmonary  embolus.
-Right  hilar  mass  resulting  in  partial  post  obstructive
collapse  of  the anterior  segment  of  the  right  upper
lobe.    There  are  air  bronchograms  in  this region  and
infection  is  not  excluded.
-Scattered  small  opacities  in  the  left  lung  are
nonspecific.
-Emphysema.
-Severe  kyphosis  with  compression  deformities.

CXR chest:
-Previously noted R hilar opacity decreased in size.
LLL/lingular opacity/consolidation.

Echo:
1. The left atrium is moderately dilated. The left atrium is
elongated.
2.The right atrium is moderately dilated.
3.Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity
size is normal. There is mild global left ventricular
hypokinesis. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%).

4.Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal.
5.The ascending aorta is moderately dilated. The aortic arch is
mildly
dilated.
6.The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis or
regurgitation is not present.
7.The mitral valve leaflets are moderately thickened. No mitral
regurgitation
is present.
8.There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
9. There is no pericardial effusion.


Brief Hospital Course:
1. Pneumonia/Sepsis: Pt was admitted for post-obstructive
pneumonia. Pt was initially transferred to the ICU for
hypotension requiring pressors (levophed) and total of 7 L of
IVF.  He was started on Ceftaz, levofloxacin, and metronidazole,
but was later tailored to Levo/Flagyl.  His Toprol was held in a
setting of hypotension and he was stabilized and was transferred
to the floor where his oxygenation improved by HD #5 where he
was breathing well on room air.  He will be discharged with
total of 14 day course of Levo/Flagyl.

2. Dyspnea: Pt with no known CHF, hx of a-fib.  Pt noted to have
pulmonary edema on CXr and increased UE and LE edema after
aggressive fluid resusscitation with 7 L of IVF.  Pt was gently
diuresed with lasix, spironolactone.  Pt became slightly
alkalotic from contraction so Diamox was given for alkalosis.
Echo was done which showed with EF 50-55%, mild hypokinesis of
LV wall, no MR, no pericardial effusion.  Pt has a baseline LE
edema from chronic venous stasis.

3. Pancytopenia: secondary to recent chemotherapy.  Pt got
Neupogen with the goal of WBC>2.0.  WBC peaked at 19.5.  WBC
count on discharge was 14.3.

4. Thrombocytopenia: Plt count on admission was 137 and steadily
dropped to 51.  HIT was suspected and Heparin was discontinued
and HIT antibody was sent.  The result is pending at the time of
discharge.  His platelet count stabilized at 54 at the time of
discharge.  He will have the VNA check CBC and have the result
faxed to Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **].  If the HIT antibody comes back positive, pt
was instructed to return to [**Hospital1 18**] for further treatment with
meds such as argatroban.

5. Atrial fibrillation: Pt was continued on digoxin but his home
Toprol was held due to hypotension.  Pt was discharged with his
regular digoxin and half the dose of Toprol he was taking at
home.
