HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 89-year-old
woman with severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (with
an FEV1 of 0.62) who presented on the day of admission with
increased shortness of breath and lethargy times one day.

The patient has had multiple chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease exacerbations in the past.  In the Emergency
Department, the patient's initial arterial blood gas was pH
of 7.21, PCO2 of 113, and PO2 was 76.  She was given
Solu-Medrol and started on [**Hospital1 **]-level positive airway pressure
and was sent the [**Hospital Ward Name 332**] Intensive Care Unit.  [**Hospital1 **]-level
positive airway pressure was not successful.  She was changed
to nasal cannula with only 2 liters of oxygen producing an
oxygen saturation of 92%.  She had no fevers or chills on
history, and no focus of infection was found on examination
other than thrush, for which she was given a dose of
fluconazole.

The patient was continued on Solu-Medrol in house.  It was
converted to prednisone upon transfer from the [**Hospital Ward Name 332**]
Intensive Care Unit to the floor on [**7-14**].  She was started
on levofloxacin and continued on nebulizers and puffers.  She
was clinically much improved when she was called to the
floor.

The patient also has a history of syndrome of inappropriate
secretion of antidiuretic hormone with her sodium during this
admission dropping from 137 to 132.  She had been receiving
gentle intravenous fluids but was changed to a fluid
restriction.  She also has a history of hypertension and
started having right shoulder pain on [**7-13**] at 11 a.m.

An electrocardiogram revealed V1 through V2 ST elevations;
consistent with otherwise old changes.  Cardiac enzymes were
positive for a troponin leak to 3.2.  She had no chest pain
currently at the time of transfer to the floor.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
2.  Syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic
hormone.
3.  Seizures.
4.  Dementia.
5.  Hypertension.
6.  Colon cancer; status post resection.
7.  Osteoarthritis.
8.  Iron deficiency anemia.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  She lives at home with four children.  A
20-pack-year tobacco history, second-hand [**Month (only) **] from her
children.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Salmeterol, Combivent, aspirin,
calcium carbonate, multivitamin, Colace, vitamin D, and salt
tablets, Fosamax, and Detrol.

ALLERGIES:  DOXYCYCLINE.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Physical examination
on transfer to the floor revealed vital signs were stable.
She was afebrile.  Saturating 90% to 97% on 1 liter nasal
cannula.  In general, in no apparent distress.  Head, eyes,
ears, nose, and throat examination revealed extraocular
movements were intact.  Pupils were equal, round, and
reactive to light and accommodation.   The mucous membranes
were moist.  The oropharynx was clear.  The neck was supple.
No jugular venous distention, bruits, or lymphadenopathy.
Chest examination revealed decreased breath sounds.
Increased expiratory phase.  Positive coarse breath sounds.
No crackles.  Cardiovascular examination revealed a regular
rate and rhythm.  Normal first heart sounds and second heart
sounds.  No murmurs, rubs, or gallops.  The abdomen revealed
positive bowel sounds.  Soft, nontender, and nondistended.
Extremity examination revealed no clubbing, cyanosis, or
edema.  Neurologically, alert and oriented to person and
place but not to date.

PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:   Pertinent
laboratory data revealed white blood cell count was 11,
hematocrit was 35.7, and platelets were 314.  Glucose was 98,
sodium was 132, potassium was 4.5, chloride was 91,
bicarbonate was 37, blood urea nitrogen was 9, and creatinine
was 0.4.  Magnesium was 2.2.

HOSPITAL COURSE BY ISSUE/SYSTEM:

 1.  CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE EXACERBATION AND
TRACHEOBRONCHITIS:  The patient was continued on a prednisone
taper, her nebulizers, and puffers.  She was continued on
antibiotics for a total of five days.

 2.  QUESTION OF CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE:  The patient did
have a positive troponin while in house.  She was not started
on a beta blocker given her severe chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease.  She was continued on aspirin.

Because of her debilitated state and severe chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease, she would not be a candidate
for any cardiac intervention, so the plan was made to
medically manage her to the best possibility.

 3.  SYNDROME OF INAPPROPRIATE SECRETION OF ANTIDIURETIC
HORMONE:  The patient's sodium was followed while in house.
Fluid restrictions were maintained.  Her sodium improved
while in house and was normal at the time of discharge.

 4.  DEMENTIA:  Her dementia remained at baseline throughout
her hospital stay.

 5.  HYPERTENSION:  The patient's hypertension was stable,
and she did not require any medications at the time of this
hospitalization.

 6.  ANEMIA:  The patient's hematocrit levels were followed,
and they remained stable.

 7.  THRUSH:  The patient was continued on clotrimazole
troches for her thrush.

 8.  PROPHYLAXIS:  The patient received prophylaxis with
subcutaneous heparin for deep venous thrombosis, with
famotidine for gastrointestinal prophylaxis, and with calcium
and vitamin D for steroid-induced osteoporosis prophylaxis.

 9.  CODE STATUS:  The patient's code status was to remain at
full status.  After discussion with the family, this was
confirmed.

10.  FLUIDS/ELECTROLYTES/NUTRITION:  The patient was fluid
restricted.  She tolerated a regular diet.  Her electrolytes
were repleted.

DISCHARGE DISPOSITION:  Given the patient's baseline clinical
condition, the decision was made to discharge the patient to
home.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  Discharge status was to home with
services.
