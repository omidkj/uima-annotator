ADMISSION DIAGNOSIS:  Fever.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:  Fungemia.

ADMISSION HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a
49-year-old woman admitted to the MICU for hypercarbic
respiratory failure in the setting of question sepsis.  The
patient was intubated two times in the SICU first for
possible fungemia with what grew out to fungemia, [**Female First Name (un) 564**]
parapsilosis and second time for [**Last Name (un) **], postextubation
laryngeal edema.

Per the Emergency Room report, the patient was a 49-year-old
woman with a history of chronic nausea, vomiting, and
headache.  The patient reports nausea and vomiting x3 days
prior to admission.  She developed a temperature of 102 the
night prior to admission.  She also continued to develop a
headache which was dull, bifrontal and improving without
meningitic signs or photophobia.  At the time of admission,
she denied chest pain, shortness of breath, abdominal pain,
or dysuria.

In the Emergency Room, her temperature was 101.6, her blood
pressure was 104/56, heart rate 110, respiratory rate 18, and
O2 saturation is 95% on room air.  She was given Dilaudid,
Flagyl, and Phenergan, 1 gram of Vancomycin and Levaquin IV
in the Emergency Room.  She experienced hypercarbic failure
on the floor on [**2-12**], and was intubated but is now
extubated.

thought secondary to bilious reflux from her J limb efferent,

of 25-30%, left ventricular systolic function depressed, MR
2+/3+ TR.

HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM:
Pulmonary:  The cause of the patient's respiratory distress
was unclear.  The patient was treated for sepsis initially
because she was hypercarbic breathing at a rate of over 40
and not hypoxic when initially intubated.  Her chest x-ray
was consistent with possible congestive heart failure.  Her
CTA was negative for large pulmonary embolus and the patient
was easily extubated and improved the next day on [**2-10**]
without diuresis.

On the evening of [**2-10**], the patient started to respond to
racemic Epinephrine and improved.  On [**2-11**], the patient
experienced focal wheezing over neck and then progressive
tachypnea, hypercarbia, and lactate up to 10.  The patient
continued to wheeze and have symptoms of CHF that did not
improve with Lasix.  The patient's symptoms were discussed
with Interventional Pulmonology and postextubation laryngeal
edema was suspected.  The patient was intubated and then
extubated in the SICU again.

Of note, the patient has a history of restrictive pulmonary
function tests and therefore, the question of pulmonary
vasculitis was raised.  There was also the possibility of
aspiration.  On the medical floor, the patient's respiratory
status was stable.  A repeat x-ray was performed.  The x-ray
showed minimal bibasilar atelectasis with no pneumonia.

ID:  The patient presented initially with fungemia.  She
continued on Fluconazole and a repeat echocardiogram.  Per
recommendations, the patient should not wear artificial
nails.  Also Ophthalmology examination and a re-echo were
done, further evaluation and were negative.

Fever/leukocytosis:  In the SICU, the patient finished six
days of broad coverage of linezolid and Flagyl given the
question episode of sepsis.  She finished a seven day course
of Ceptaz for Pseudomonal urinary tract infection, although
this was felt likely due to possible colonization, and
continue on fluconazole on [**2-6**].  She will be discharged
with a course of one additional month course of fluconazole
for fungemia.

Repeat CT scan of the abdomen was negative on [**2-16**] showing
no abscess or fluid collection.

Cardiology:  Patient with a history of congestive heart
failure.  Echocardiogram was performed and showed a depressed
ejection fraction of 25% with MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **].  This, however,
continued to improv
