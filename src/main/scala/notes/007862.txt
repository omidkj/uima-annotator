Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 10842**]
Chief Complaint:
fever

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**8-20**] Sternal wound debridement


History of Present Illness:
67 yo F with h/o DM, HTN, HIT, PE, mitral valve replacement &
CAD s/p CABG [**4-1**] c/b chronic sternal wound infection with
multi-drug resistant Pseudomonas and ESBL E.coli, who presented
from rehab with fevers for evaluation of sternal wound. On ROS,
also c/o chronic sternal and right-sided chest wall pain
reproducible to palpation. Endorses SOB and cough productive of
white phlegm for the past 2 weeks.
.
In the ED, initial VS were: 98 110 133/46 33 100% 4L. She was
tachypneic with SOB and cough, rectal temp 103. CXR showed left
base atelectasis. CTA chest done and unchanged with no PE. She
was clinically felt to have pneumonia and treated with
vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and levofloxacin. CPAP attempted
temporarily for tachypnea without substantial effect; her
tachypnea was felt to be more related to anxiety, as her RR
improved while asleep. EKG was unchanged. ABG attempt
unsuccessful. Received aspirin as well as albuterol/ipratropium
nebs and methylprednisolone for possible COPD.

IMAGING:
[**2114-8-14**] CXR: Minimal left basilar atelectasis.
.
[**2114-8-14**]: CTA CHEST W&W/O C: 1. No evidence of pulmonary
embolism. No evidence of acute cardiothoracic process. 2. No
change of post surgical changes at the sternum. No evidence of
fluid collection. No change of the sternal bed compared to
[**2114-7-13**]. 3. Mild prominence of the left adrenal gland,
more conspicuous than on prior exam.
.
[**2114-8-19**] RUQ U/S: Mildly thick-walled gallbladder, with mobile
gallstone, and without other signs of cholecystitis uch as
distension, pericholecystic fluid or tenderness. Acute
cholecystitis is not excluded. If there is continued clinical
concern, a HIDA scan could be obtained for further evaluation.
.
[**2114-8-20**] echocardiogram (TEE) : Mild spontaneous echo contrast is
seen in the body of the left atrium. No mass/thrombus is seen in
the left atrium or left atrial appendage. No atrial septal
defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is mild symmetric
left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size
is normal. There is mild to moderate regional left ventricular
systolic dysfunction with severe inferior, inferoseptal, and
lateral hypokinesis. Overall left ventricular systolic function
is mildly depressed (LVEF= 40 %). There are simple atheroma in
the ascending aorta. There are simple atheroma in the aortic
arch. There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic
aorta. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but
aortic stenosis is not present. No masses or vegetations are
seen on the aortic valve. There are filamentous strands on the
aortic leaflets consistent with Lambl's excresences (normal
variant). Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The motion of the
mitral valve prosthetic leaflets appears normal. They may be
mildly thickened. No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral
valve. There is a minimally increased gradient consistent with
trivial mitral stenosis. Trivial , central valvular mitral
regurgitation is seen. Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] was notified in person of the
results in the operating room at the time of the procedure.
.
[**2114-8-21**] CTA chest:1. There is no evidence of a central 1st-3rd
order pulmonary embolism. The pulmonary artery is normal in
diameter (25 mm). Embolism distal to this level cannot be
excluded due to suboptimal image quality. 2. Small bilateral
pleural effusions, slightly enlarged since [**2114-8-14**]. Mild stable
left upper lobe atelectasis. 3. Global cardiac enlargement,
stable since [**2114-4-25**]. 4. Sternal wound and probable associated
anterior chest wall fluid collection/cellulitis consistent with
the given history of recurrent sternal wound infection and
recent debridement.
.
[**2114-8-21**] CT Head: Unchanged size and appearance of right frontal
extra-axial mass, likely a meningioma, with unchanged
surrounding edema and mass effect. No evidence of new
intracranial abnormalities.
.
[**2114-8-21**] CXR: The pacemaker defibrillator leads are in unchanged
position.
Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged. Lungs are essentially
clear. Note is made that the pacemaker is obscuring parts of the
left lung base. No appreciable pleural effusion is demonstrated.
No appreciable pneumothorax is seen.
.
[**2114-8-23**] B/L LE U/S: No evidence of deep vein thrombosis in
either leg.
.
[**2114-9-4**] CXR: No evidence of fluid overload. No acute
cardiopulmonary abnormality.
.
