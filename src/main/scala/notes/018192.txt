Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 905**]
Chief Complaint:
Multifocal pneumonia, Acute renal failure

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **] y.o. male with dementia, prior left frontotemporal CVA,
atrial fibrillation on warfarin, COPD by radiograph who presents
from nursing home with dyspnea and found to have multifocal
pneumonia on chest radiograph new from prior admission 12 days
ago. According to patient's wife, he was in his normal state of
health the day prior, which is demented, unable to walk and or
perform ADLs, but had eaten a full meal. He reportedly has had
problems with swallowing his foods and has been noted to cough
after eating and drinking. To the best of the wife's knowledge,
he has not had any sick contacts. Today, he was noted to have a
dyspnea and a low-grade fever and was thus brought in to the ED
for further evaluation.
.
In the ED, initial vs were: 100.8, 124/104, 137, 28-40, 99% NRB
(89% RA), blood pressure dipped to 78/29 at 2100 prior to
transfer and lactate was elevated to 6.2. CXR showed multifocal
PNA and patient was given vancomycin 1g, zosyn 4.5g, and 650mg
tylenol along with 1 liter normal saline. After discussion with
patient's wife and HCP, it was clarified that patient is
DNR/DNI. Additionally, the patient's wife expressed a desire to
have no central access or pressors. Given his dyspnea and
tachypnea, BiPAP was started and the patient was more calm. He
was admitted to the ICU for further management.
.
On the floor, patient appeared comfortable and denied pain. He
was able to follow commands. The patient's wife and son were
engaged in a lengthy conversation during which the wife revealed
that she is confident that the patient would not want anything
to prolong his life given his current mental status and quality
of life. She and her son expressed a goal of keeping him
comfortable with BiPAP since it had been started and morphine if
necessary for air hunger. The wife eventually expressed an
interest in discontinuing antibiotics since she felt that they
were counterproductive in the goal of not prolonging his life.
It was also decided to hold IVF.  See above.

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient a [**Age over 90 **] year old male with dementia, prior left
frontotemporal CVA, atrial fibrillation on warfarin, COPD by
radiograph here with multifocal pneumonia, UTI, acute renal
failure and septic shock.
.
# Multifocal PNA: On presetntation, patient was septic with
urinary and pulmonary source requiring ICU care. History
suggests aspiration, though CXR is not entirely consistent with
this given left-sided infiltrates, though it certainly doesn't
rule out aspiration. While in the ICU, patient was given a
single dose of vanc/levo/zosyn. A family meeting was done, and
goals of care were determined to be comfort only and the
antibiotics were discontinued. Given goals of care, explicitly
discussed with patient's HCP, will focus management on comfort
and forego management otherwise of sepsis with CVL, pressors,
IVF and cultures. See above. Patient refused oxygen once on the
floor, but while CMO, the patient improved spontanously. At the
time of discharge, his conditioned had improved so much, vital
signs were stable and he was satting 96% RA. Family meeting was
done and he was started of cefepoxidime.
.
# Code status - While in the ICU, he appeared septic and family
wanted CMO. On the floor, there was a significant improvement in
his condition and he was made DNR/DNI with PO antibiotic
administration.
.
# ARF: Baseline Cr 1.2-1.3. Elevated to 1.7, likely pre-renal.
Will hold on IVF in accordance to goals of care.  Further labs
were not done.
.
# Atrial fibrillation: Not currently tachycardic. On
anticoagulation with coumadin.
- holding anticoagulation whlie CMO, family may consider
resuming as outpatient if they want lab draws.
.
# Code status: confirmed DNR/DNI; no central or arterial lines,
no vasopressors , see above
.
