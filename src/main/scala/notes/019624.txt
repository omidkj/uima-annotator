History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 20948**] is a 62F with a PMH s/f COPD (home O2 2-3L) on
chronic prednisone, DM, CAD, s/p MI, VF s/p ICD, Chronic
diastolic heart failure, with a recent hospitalization at [**Hospital 79221**] hospital in Main ([**2196-6-9**]) for CHF exacerbation and
unstable angina.
Her hospitalzation was complicated by respiratory failure,
pseudomonas tracheal-bronchitis, severe c. diff colitis and
subsequent toxic megacolon leading to abdominal compartment
syndrome. Patient underwent tracheotomy / PEG tube placement
after prolonged hospitalization and failure to wean off
mechianical ventilator.
Patient was recently discharged to a rehab facility where on
arrival she was noted to be in respiratory distress with an ABG
of 7.24/59/80.  She was sent to the [**Hospital1 2177**] ED where a repeat ABG
was 7.38/23/73. She was empirically started on Vancomycin /
Levaquin and sent back to rehab. On the morning of admission,
patient desaturated to the 80s, requiring FiO2 of 100% and an
increase in her PEEP to 10, and was sent to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED as the
[**Hospital1 2177**] ICU was on diversion.
In the emergency department her initial vital signs were 96.9,
SBP's 70-90, HR= 108-120.  A right femoral line (patient has a
left subclavian clot, and a right PICC placed in [**Month (only) 596**]) and
arterial line were placed, and the patient was started on
levophed (was volume overloaded on CXR).
Current ventilator settings are tidal volume of 550, PEEP of 10,
and an FiO2 of 100%, where she is satting 100% with an ABG of pH
7.31 pCO2
50 pO2 109 HCO3 26 .
She was given albuterol and atrovent nebulizers for COPD.  CXR
revealed volume overload vs. PNA, so the patient was given 40mg
of IV lasix, and vancomycin/zosyn for presumed VAP.  Urine and
blood cultures were obtained. She was sent for a CTA prior to
coming to the MICU, but heparin was not started as her
tracheostomy site is bleeding.

CHEST X-RAY ([**2196-8-4**])
SINGLE AP SEMI-UPRIGHT RADIOGRAPH OF THE CHEST: There is diffuse
bilateral
pulmonary edema, right more than left with associated small
right pleural
effusion and probable left pleural effusion. There is mild
cardiomegaly.
Aortic calcifications are evident. There is no pneumothorax.

Right chest wall AICD device with right ventricular lead in
standard location and another shorter lead with distal anchoring
device projecting over the right lung apex. There is a third
lead, which is not definitely visualized, and best visualized up
to the upper portion of right atrium. The PICC line is
terminating within the proximal right subclavian. Tracheostomy
tube is noted. Visualized osseous and soft tissue structures are
otherwise unremarkable.

IMPRESSION:
1. Severe bilateral pulmonary edema, right more than left, with
associated
small pleural effusions.
2. AICD device with right ventricular lead in standard location
and second
lead not seen in its entirety is best visualized up to the upper
atrium. Third redundant lead is seen to project over the right
lung apex.
3. Right PICC line terminating in the proximal subclavian

CTA CHEST ([**2196-8-4**])
-------------------
The pulmonary arteries are well opacified with no filling defect
suspicious for pulmonary embolism. The aorta shows mild
atherosclerotic calcification, but the size is within normal
limit, and there is no evidence of aneurysmal dilatation or
dissection.
The heart size is moderately enlarged. There is no pericardial
effusion.
Bilateral left more than right moderate pleural effusions are
seen.
Diffuse airspace disease with ground-glass opacities, septal
thickening, and areas of consolidation are seen in both lung
fields.
In the mediastinum, there are multiple enlarged lymph nodes;
11.2-mm right
paratracheal lymph node, 7-mm left prevascular lymph node,
8.8-mm left
paratracheal lymph node, and 1-cm right lower paratracheal lymph
node.
A tracheostomy tube terminates in the midthoracic portion of the
trachea. A right-sided dual-leaded pacemaker is seen with the
right atrial lead projects beyond the boundaries of the right
atrium and terminates in the IVC.
The evaluation of the abdomen shows diffuse atherosclerotic
calcification of The aorta, celiac artery, SMA, renal arteries,
and iliacs. The patient is status post aorto-[**Hospital1 **]-iliac bypass.
The weak contrast material within the circulation system of the
abdomen and pelvis cannot exclude or confirm the presence of
underlying DVT involving the iliac veins.
There is no evidence of contrast excretion from both kidneys.
The liver, spleen are unremarkable. The pancreas is unremarkable
as well.
A small stone is seen in the Gallbladder. One of the cruses of
the right
adrenal gland has a speckle of calcification without soft tissue
masses.
A hypodense lesion likely a cyst is seen arising from the
inferior pole of the right kidney.
The small and large bowels demonstrate normal caliber with no
evidence of wall thickening, pneumatosis, or adjacent
inflammation.
Trace amount of free fluid is seen in the right upper quadrant
and left upper quadrant and in the pelvis in close proximity to
an atrophic uterus.
a Foley catheter is seen in the bl
