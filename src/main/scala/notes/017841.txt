Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2181**]
Chief Complaint:
1) Upper GI bleed

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
EGD

History of Present Illness:
Pt is a [**Age over 90 **] yo female who was transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] for
treatment of a upper GI bleed from a mass like lesion in her
stomach.  On [**7-25**] she was admitted to [**Hospital3 8544**] with a
right lower quadrant pneumonia.  Five days before that, she was
seen at the [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 5871**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] for asthmatic bronchitis, and she was
treated with prednisone.  The [**Hospital 228**] hospital course
apparently proceeded without complication until the day prior to
when she was supposed to be discharged [**7-31**] when she vomited
bright red blood and melena (INR 3.1).  An EGD was done on [**8-1**]
which revealed a large clot on the fundus.  Cardiac enzymes were
negative.  CT was negative for splenic vein thrombosis, or liver
disease, but was positive for a 3 cm round lesion in the
pancreatic head.  Repeat EGD on [**2170-8-3**] showed a lobulated mass
in the fundus that was quite soft.  EGD on [**8-4**] showed a
submucosal vascular appearing mass overlying the cardiac border
with feeding vessels but no active bleeding.  The patient
subsequently received 6 units of RBC and 3 units of FFP and 3 mg
Vit K which raised the Hct to 30.4 before transfer from the OSH
to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation.  Just before transfer, however,
the patient had another episode of hematemesis (200mL BRB) along
with grossly melanotic stools and tachycardia/afib.  Her HCT
decreased from 32.7 to 28.4 and increased to 29.7 with 2 units
PRBCs.  She was intubated for airway protection.  On admission
to the [**Hospital1 18**], the patient received 1 unit of RBC.  Her Hct was
30.9.  Hct on [**8-4**] was 28.4 from 32 and then increased to 29.7
with 1 unit of PRBCs.  No bleeding was seen at the [**Hospital1 18**].  She
did not have any GI complaints, h/o HIV, chest pain, liver
disease, or a history of GI bleeds.

Brief Hospital Course:
1) Upper GI bleed: In the ICU, the patient's soft vascular mass
was considered to be gastroesophageal varices.  Other
possibilities in the differential were leiomyoma, lipoma, or
malignancy.  It was generally felt that whatever the precise
character, the mass was still oozing blood insofar as the three
units that she received at the outside hospital did not
significantly increase her Hct.  The ICU team set a goal of Hct
> 30 given her age and potential rapidity of rebleeding.  On ICU
day 2, the patient was transfused 1 unit PRBC to reach a Hct of
32.1, but she continued to have no episodes of hematemesis or
melena.  RUQ ultrasound was negative for signs of liver disease.
 A repeat EGD was also performed which revealed 1. a normal
celiac axis.  2.  pancreatic body and the PD within it were
normal.  3.  in the proximal stomach, the protruding mass was
identified and endosonographically was both hypoechoic and
vascularly consistent with gastric varices.  Unfortunately, it
remained difficult to determine the cause of the most latter
finding.  On [**8-8**], the patient was transferred from the ICU to
the floor for further care under the medicine service.  At this
point, the GI team saw her and recommended nadolol to help
decrease portal pressures.  Anticoagulation remained
discontinued, and the patient's femoral line was discontinued.
A PPI was started to decrease gastric distress and the patient's
diet was advanced to a soft, low salt diet.  Potassium was
repleted as necessary.  The patient did not experience any
repeat episodes of hematemesis or melena.  All stools were
guaiac negative.  At discharge, the patient's Hct was 36.0.
Throughout the hospital course within the ICU and on the floor,
the patient's family was kept well-informed of all medical
decisions.  Some clarification will be required regarding her
code status as it is relatively unclear.  At the moment, she is
full code, but her son has expressed a desire not to have "my
mother on any machines."  The patient's daughter, her health
care proxy wishes to have "aggressive but not extraordinary"
routes of treatment pursued.

2) Cardiac:  With respect to atrial fibrillation, The patient
was rate controlled on digoxin and discontinued from
anticoagulation in light of her upper GI bleed.  Heart rate
remained stable at <100.  Cardiac ECHO was performed on [**8-8**]
which showed the following: 1.  Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). 2.  no free wall motion
abnormalities. 3.  Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
4. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. 5.
Significant pulmonic regurgitation is seen.

3) Activity: Physical therapy was consulted and the patient was
found to demonstrate safe and independent functional mobility
with a cane.  It was recommended that she be discharged home
with home safety evaluation and home PT.  The patient's family,
however, refused to take the patient home and the patient was
screened for transfer to a lower level rehab facility.

4) Hypothyroid: the patient was continued on levothyroxine

5)Code Status: The patient was admitted with a code status of
DNR but full intubation.  However, upon further discussion, her
code status changed to full code.  This topic will need to be
discussed in more detail at a later date.
