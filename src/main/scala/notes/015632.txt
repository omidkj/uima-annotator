CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Asked to see this patient following cardiac
catheterization where he was found to have three-vessel
disease with an EF of 30 percent.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  72-year-old man with known CAD
status post a MI in [**2148**] underwent cardiac catheterization on
the day of admission and was found to have three-vessel
disease with calcified left main and EF of 30 percent by echo
done in [**2175-3-25**]. The patient had recently stopped digoxin.
He is status post DC cardioversion in [**2175-3-25**]. Woke with
palpitations and chest pain radiating to his jaw. Called [**7-26**]-
1 who on arrival found him to be in a wide complex
tachycardia with a heart rate 180s and hypotension.  They had
to defibrillate him at the scene with 100 joules. He then
went into A-fib with a rate of 115 and better hemodynamics.
At that time, he was transported to   [**Hospital1 18**] for cardiac
catheterization.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Includes CAD status post MI times two,
A-fib, CVA in '[**69**] with residual left-sided weakness,
hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2 which is diet-
controlled, hypercholesterolemia.  Patient's catheterization
showed a calcified left main, LAD with 80 and 90 percent mid
lesion, left circumflex with a 60-70 percent lesion in the
origin, OM-2 with an 80 percent lesion, RCA with diffuse
disease, RPL with 80 percent lesion.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Married, lives with wife, remote tobacco
history, quit in [**2148**] and occasional alcohol use.

ALLERGIES:  Include ampicillin which causes anaphylaxis.

MEDICATIONS:
1. Aspirin 81 once daily.
2. Atenolol 100 once daily.
3. Lisinopril 40 once daily.
4. Lipitor 10 once daily.
5. Coumadin 5 on Monday through Friday and 7.5 on Saturday
   and Sunday.
6. Digoxin had been recently discontinued.
7. Lasix 20 once daily.
8. Amiodarone at 1 mg per hour.


LABORATORY DATA:  EKG showed a sinus rhythm with left bundle
branch block, rate of [**Street Address(2) 95877**] depressions in I, II and
III, as well as V3-6 and flip Ts in AVL. Chest x-ray shows no
congestive heart failure.  No significant abnormalities, a
tortuous aorta.  UA is pending.

White count 5.5, hematocrit 41.6, platelets 105, PT 17.8, PTT
32.6, INR 2.0, sodium 142, potassium 4.3, chloride 107, CO2
of 27, BUN 28, creatinine 1.5, glucose 105, CK 181 and 259,
troponin 0.6.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Neurologically alert and oriented
times three.  Moves all extremities with some left-sided
weakness.  Follows commands.  Respiratory:  Clear to
auscultation bilaterally.  Cardiovascular:  Regular rate and
rhythm. S1-S2 with no murmur.  Abdomen:  Soft, nontender,
nondistended with positive bowel sounds.  Extremities are
warm with no edema.  Pulses:  Carotid two plus with a soft
bruit on the right, two plus with no bruit on the left.
Radial two plus bilaterally.  Femoral two plus bilaterally.
Dorsalis pedis one plus bilaterally.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and a
plan was made to obtain a carotid duplex, echocardiogram, to
stop the Coumadin and begin heparin drip and to wait until
the patient's INR normalized prior to the patient undergoing
surgery.  The patient was followed by the medical service
preoperatively and ultimately on [**8-16**], he was brought
to the operating room at which time he underwent coronary
artery bypass grafting times four.  Please see the OR report
for full details. In summary, the patient had a CABG times
four with the LIMA to the LAD, saphenous vein graft to OM,
saphenous vein graft to PDA with a Y to the RPLV. His bypass
time was 95 minutes with a cross-clamp time of 67 minutes.
He tolerated the operation well and was transferred from the
operating room to the Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit.

At the time of transfer, the patient was A-paced at a rate of
88.  He had a mean arterial pressure of 66 with a CVP of 14.
He had epinephrine at 0.02 mcg/kg/min, propofol at 30
mcg/kg/min and nitroglycerin and 0.5 mcg/kg/min.

The patient did well in the immediate postoperative period.
He remained hemodynamically stable.  He was reversed from his
anesthesia, weaned from the ventilator and successfully
extubated. During this period, he remained hemodynamically
stable.

Postoperative day one, the patient continued to be
hemodynamically stable although he did have a high oxygen
requirement. During the course of postoperative day one, the
patient was weaned from his epinephrine drip.  He was also
weaned from his Nipride drip during which the patient
remained hemodynamically stable. On postoperative day two,
the patient's Swan-Ganz catheter was removed.  His was on
beta blockade as well as hydralazine. His chest tubes were
removed and he was transferred to the floor for continuing
postoperative care and cardiac rehabilitation.

Once on the floor, the patient had an uneventful
postoperative course.  His activity level was advanced with
the assistance of the nursing staff as well as the Physical
Therapy Department.

On postoperative day three, his temporary pacing wires were
discontinued and he was begun back on his Coumadin.

On postoperative day five, it was decided that the patient
was stable and ready to be discharged to home. At the time of
this dictation, the patient's physical exam is as follows.

rate 68, sinus rhythm, blood pressure 138/72, respiratory
