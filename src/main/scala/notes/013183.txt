Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 290**]
Chief Complaint:
respiratory distress

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Insertion right radial line

History of Present Illness:
HPI: 83 male w/ oropharyngeal carcinoma s/p laryngectomy, copd,
reported frequent aspiration pna, now being admitted for further
evaluation and monitoring of acute respiratory distress. History
and records limited but apparently pt recently d/c'd from VA for
reported RLL PNA for which recently completed course of
Ceftriaxone and Zithromax. Apparently, staying at [**Hospital3 1186**]
and today had a witnessed episode of aspiration following
Nystatin swish and swallow. Reportedly became diaphoretic,
tachypneic and hypoxic to low 80's, improving to low 90's on
several liters of nasal cannula. Transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for
further evaluation where upon arrival found afebrile, tachy to
100's, normotensive but tachypneic to 40 and satting in high
90's on NRB. Given Levaquin and Flagyl empirically for presumed
aspiration PNA. Wet read CXR demonstrates r. sided pleural
effusion, mildly enlarged cardiac silohette. Labs unremarkable
and ABG shows 7.36/43/213 on NRB. Pt subjectively still SOB but
feeling improved. Given concerns about persistent tachypnea and
poor functional status, transferrd to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for closer
monitoring.  While awaiting transfer, pt reportedly was weened
to 4l NC and RR of 30.  Immediately prior to transfer, EMS
states that pt had a large amount of emesis, unclear if
aspirated.
.
On arrival to [**Name (NI) 153**], pt in respiratory distress with RR 40, HR
130s, SBP 160s, diaphoretic, accessory muscle use.  Had very
prominent course upper airway rhonchi.  Deep suctioning by RT
returned thick, copious secretions but minimal improvement in
respiratory status.  ABG on NRB = 7.25/59/100.  Patient was
subsequently intubated given substantial distress.  Of note, he
had previously signed a DNR/DNI order but in the ED the patient
reportedly expressed to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] the desire to undergo a
limited intubation if there was a reversible process.  Although
in significant distress, the pt confirmed this wish in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].
 The patient was subsequently intubated and placed on assist
control mechanical ventilation.

Brief Hospital Course:
83m w/ significant h/o oropharyngeal carcinoma s/p laryngectomy
and [**Hospital 2182**] transferred from rehab facility following witnessed
aspiration event, subsequently intubated [**3-11**] respiratory
distress.

1. Respiratory failure:  Patient was intubated shortly after his
arrival to the ICU [**3-11**] significant respiratory distress in the
setting of copious secretions/ mucous plugging.  He was
initially placed on assist control but was able to transition to
Pressure Support for much of the time.  He maintained good
oxygen saturations and he experienced no further respiratory
distress.  After two days on mechanical ventilation he an SBT
with a RSBI of 42 and was subsequently extubated without
complication.  After being extubated he maintained good O2 sats
and was able to handle his secretions with much less difficulty
than on admission.  His respiratory status was much improved
prior to discharge.

2. Pneumonia
He was started on Clindamycin initially for anaerobic coverage
of a presumed aspiration pneumonia.  Shortly after he was put on
Vancomycin when a sputum culture on admission grew out gram
positive cocci in pairs and clusters.  Given his multiple
hospitalizations it was thought that he was likely colonized
with MRSA. Patient should complete a 10 day course of treatment
with Vancomycin and Clindamycin which would be completed on
[**2167-9-24**].  Sputum culture later more suggestive of oropharyngeal
flora but continued Vancomycin as he had clinically improved and
he was recently hospitalized with a pneumonia. A PICC line was
inserted so that patient can receive IV antibiotics at rehab.
Patient kept NPO as patient seemed to have an aspiration event
that triggered his respiratory decompensation.  It is possible
that he never fully recovered from his recent pneumonia and that
it may have worsened at rehab precipitating his current
admission.

As noted above, unclear as to whether or not patient had primary
bacterial PNA or aspiration PNA.  It is clear however that
hospitalization was precipitated by aspiration event after
witnessed episode
