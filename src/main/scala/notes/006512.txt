Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 477**]
Chief Complaint:
 Hypoxia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
This is a 71 year-old male with a history of pancreatic
adenocarcinoma and gastric outlet obstruction who presents with
hypoxic respiratory failure. Patient was noted to be hypoxic on
routine vitals with O2 saturation of 70% on 5 litres nasal
cannula. He was placed on a 100% non-rebreather with O2
saturations gradually improving to 95% over several minutes.
Rest of the vitals at the time were HR:128, RR:22, BP:125/57.
ABG on non-rebreather was 7.25/67/80. Patient received
aggressive suctioning that yielded 20cc of what appeared to be
gastric contents. On [**2138-8-3**], patient had been started on
Vancomycin and Piperacillin-Tazobactam for presumed hospital
acquired pneumonia based on increased O2 requirement,
infiltrates on chest x-ray, and low-grade fevers. Of note,
patient has failed gastric and duodenal stenting and continues
to have persistent gastric outlet obstruction with pooling of
secretions, and was felt to have intermittent aspiration of
these secretions. An NG tube was placed for persistent
obstruction. However, on the day of transfer, patient's NG tube
was found to have not been functioning, and was pulled.
.
Patient is on furosemide at home for unclear reasons, but this
had been held 4 days prior to transfer due to fluid-responsive
hypotension in setting of gastric outlet obstruction. He had not
received any fluid boluses since [**2138-8-3**]. His fluid intake
over the past 24 hours consisted of D5W for hyponatremia and
TPN.


Past Medical History:
-- Recent diagnosis of pancreatic adenocarcinoma
-- Diabetes diagnosed 25 years ago currently on Insulin.
-- Chronic kidney failure secondary to diabetes.
-- Emphysema, currently followed by a pulmonary doctor.
-- Hypertension.
-- Status post cardiac arrest, past surgery [**55**] years prior.
-- Peripheral vascular disease.
-- Stroke TIA in [**2135**].
-- Sleep apnea on CPAP at night.
-- CABG 25yrs ago


Social History:
Lives with his wife. [**Name (NI) **] stopped smoking on
[**2138-3-20**], prior to that had smoked since he was a teenager
about half a pack a day. Does not drink alcohol and works as an
accountant a few days a week


Family History:
He has a sister with cancer of unknown origin, a
father who died of heart disease, and a mother who died of old
age.

Pertinent Results:
Laboratories [**8-5**]: Notable for sodium 151, potassium 3.1,
creatinine 2.4, hct 35.1, plts 218.  See below for rest

LFTs noted for elevations on [**8-6**] : ALT 51, AST 116, ALK Phos
1845 down from [**2034**] on [**7-31**] and total bili increased to 4.0 from
1.5 on [**7-31**] labs

Urine Cx and Blood Cx pending as of [**8-6**]
Urine dip: negative leuks, urobilinogen 4, negative for
nitrates, Glucose 150, negative ketones.

[**8-6**] UA: hazy, 4+ WBCs, 5 RBCS, few bacteria
[**8-6**] sediment: 12 granular casts, 5 hyaline casts

CXR [**8-5**]: Greater opacification at the right base is probably
atelectasis, though pneumonia cannot be excluded. A small right
pleural effusion and congestion of pulmonary and mediastinal
vasculature indicating improving cardiac function. Heart size is
normal. Small left pleural effusion persists.  Nasogastric tube
passes into the stomach and out of view. Left jugular line ends
in the mid SVC. No pneumothorax.

Brief Hospital Course:
1. Locally advanced pancreatic cancer: not surgical candidate.
Has gastric outlet obstruction related to tumor. Failed duodenal
stenting X 2.  Considered G-/G-J tube placement, but was not
clinically stable enough to tolerate procedure.  Given rapid
progression of disease, he was no longer considered able to
tolerate Cyberknife. Palliative external beam radiation was
considered.  He ultimately required NG placement and constant
suction because of nausea and vomiting.  After discussions with
the family, given his rapid decompensation, goals were changed
to symptom management and transition to hospice.

2. Hypotension/hypoxia: He developed a GI bleed related to the
stent leading to hypotension which responded to IV fluid and
blood transfusion. He later had acute desaturation from
aspiration requiring MICU transfer.  He responded to tracheal
suctioning.  He was treated with broad spectrum antibiotics for
health care associated pneumonia

3. Hypernatremia/Nutrition: unable to tolerate food due to
gastric outlet obstruction. Given TPN, however, this was
discontinued once his central line was removed.  Hypernatremia
related to dehydration, improved with IV D5W.

4. Acute on chronic renal insufficiency: related to dehydration
and hypotensive episode.  Responded to hydration.

5. Disposition: after a lengthy hospitalization and rapid
progression of his disease, goals of care were changed to
symptom management. Mr. [**Known lastname **] died with his family at bedside.
