Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 477**]
Chief Complaint:
Fevers and chills

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
TEE

History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 79 yo M with a h/o of multiple myeloma along
with multiple other medical problems including diabetes and
severe cardiac disease including coronary artery disease and
chronic ischemic heart disease with an ejection fraction of less
than 25% along with chronic renal insufficiency p/w 1 week h/o
"not feeling well" and 1 day h/o fevers/chills and cough.  The
patient was found at rehab to have a temp to 104.3/BP 82/45 and
decreased UOP.  He was brought to [**Hospital1 18**] ER.  The patient denies
abdominal pain, urinary symptoms, or chest pain. He reports some
difficulty breathing over the last week and has gotten SOB with
any activity.  He has had decreased PO intake over the last few
days.  On [**2202-4-20**] patient received day #1 of MM treatment with
Velcade at 1.3 mg/m2 (to be given on day 1,4,8,11) and Decadron
10 mg on these days as well.

ROS: sleeps with 3 pillows at baseline over last 1.5 years;
usually able to walk all around rehab without SOB, now can't
walk at all without SOB.

In the ER, the patient wasd febrile to 104 with SBP in the 70's.
 He was started on the sepsis protocol.  His lactate was 4.1
with WBC 6.1 with 6% bands.  He was given a dose of cefepime.  A
UA was negative and a CXR was clear.  He was given a total of 3L
NS in the ED.


Past Medical History:
DM
HTN
CAD- s/p CABG x 2 (LIMA-Diag, SVG-ramus then jump to OM,
SVG-acute
marginal then jump to rPDA)
CHF- EF 20%
s/p A flutter ablation

NSVT- s/p ICD [**9-28**]
Multiple myeloma diagnosed by bone marrow biopsy in [**Month (only) 956**]
[**2198**] with treatments including: Thalidomide, Methylprednisone,
Melphalan. Now on Procrit and pulse dose decadron- last pulse
in [**Month (only) 216**].
CRI (recent Cr 2.6)
Prostate cancer, status post radiation therapy.
Bladder cancer, status post BCG instillation.

Oncology History:
Diagnosed with MM in [**12-29**] when he was noted to be mildly anemic
with a hematocrit of 36.  Further workup with serum protein
electrophoresis revealed a suppressed IgA and IgM with an
elevated IgG of over 4 g consisting of monoclonal band.  Given
his other medical issues, Mr. [**Known lastname 45794**] was initially treated with
melphalan and prednisone, but this was complicated by low counts
and poor tolerance.  He also took thalidomide for a period of
time but he had increased dizziness and did not tolerate this
well.  He, at times, would have pulses of Decadron twice in
[**7-/2200**] and then 1 pulse in [**1-/2201**] but these often led to
exacerbation of his congestive heart failure requiring
hospitalization.  Because of his other medical issues, which
were often exacerbated with treatment for his myeloma, he often
was monitored by laboratory values and treated symptomatically
for his myeloma.  He has been receiving Procrit for chronic
anemia with periodic transfusions in order to maintain his
hematocrit 28-30% due to his cardiac history.  In [**8-/2201**], Mr.
[**Known lastname 45794**] was admitted due to worsening shortness of breath and
exacerbation of his congestive heart failure with also
increasing pain in the left hip area with more difficulty
walking.  During the admission, he was found to have new lytic
lesions in the hip and back and was treated with radiation
therapy to the hip and back area along with a pulse of
Decadron. His last treatment (until this week) for his myeloma
was with a 3-day pulse of melphalan at 10 mg daily starting on
[**2201-10-12**].


Social History:
The patient was living at home until a recent extended admission
to [**Hospital1 18**] ([**Date range (1) 45797**]) after which he was discharged to rehab. Mr
[**Known lastname **] is married x 58 yrs and lives in [**Location 22361**] Mass.  He has
3 adult sons, one of whom is a research administrator at [**Hospital1 18**].
Mr [**Known lastname 45798**] wife who had undergone bilateral knee replacements
last year, fell recently and shattered her femur. She is
currently in the [**Hospital **] Rehab in [**Location (un) 3915**].  He is a former
business executive. Has three sons. [**Name (NI) 4084**] smoked. Occasional
ETOH.

Pertinent Results:
REPORTS:
.
[**2202-4-23**] CXR - Single portable AP chest radiograph is compared to
[**2202-4-6**] and demonstrates no significant difference.
Again demonstrated are healing right-sided rib fractures and a
mottled appearance to the right clavicle.  The cardiac
silhouette is stable, and the mediastinal contours are stable.
Pacemaker leads and sternotomy wires identified.  No free air
under the diaphragms.  No evidence for pulmonary opacification.
.
HAND (AP, LAT & OBLIQUE) LEFT PORT  [**2202-4-24**] 1:31 PM
There are no radiographic findings to suggest osteomyelitis in
the left hand. If clinical suspicion is high, bone scan or MRI
may be considered. Diffuse vascular calcifications are present.
.
UNILAT LOWER EXT VEINS RIGHT  [**2202-4-26**] 11:01 AM
IMPRESSION: No evidence of right lower extremity deep vein
thrombosis.
.
TTE [**2202-4-29**]:
Conclusions:
The left atrium is dilated. The right atrium is markedly
dilated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (ejection
fraction 20-30 percent) secondary to akinesis and fibrosis of
the inferior and posterior walls, with at least mild hypokinesis
of the rest of the left ventricle. Tissue velocity imaging E/e'
is elevated (>15) suggesting increased left ventricular filling
pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Tissue velocity  imaging demonstrates an
e' of <0.08m/s c/w an elevated left ventricular filling pressure
(>12mmHg). No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
There is no ventricular septal defect. The right ventricular
free wall is hypertrophied. The right ventricular cavity is
dilated. Right ventricular systolic function is borderline
normal. There are focal calcifications in the aortic arch. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. No masses or vegetations are seen on
the aortic valve. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. No mass or
vegetation is seen on the mitral valve. Moderate to severe (3+)
mitral
regurgitation is seen. Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid
regurgitation is
seen. There is severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. No

vegetation/mass is seen on the pulmonic valve. The main
pulmonary artery is  dilated. The branch pulmonary arteries are
dilated. There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed)
of [**2202-2-4**], no major change is evident.
