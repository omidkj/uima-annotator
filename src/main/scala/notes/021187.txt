Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Sotalol

Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1167**]
Chief Complaint:
A-fib with RVR, hypotension, bradycardia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac catheterization [**2141-7-7**] by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]


History of Present Illness:
81F with Hx of HTN, HLD, paroxysmal afib with RVR (s/p
cardioversion and sotalol in mid-[**Month (only) **], s/p Torsades arrest in
late [**Month (only) **] d/c'd on metoprolol), moderate-severe MR, and who
presents from her rehab center with recurrent shortness of
breath and palpitations. She was discharged to her rehab center
2 weeks ago and felt well at that time. Over the past 2 weeks,
she experienced intermittent SOB/palpitations requiring
medication adjustments at the center in communication with her
PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) **] morning ([**2141-7-6**]), she experienced another episode of
SOB/palpitations and was sent to the ED for further management.
She reports SOB with as little as a few steps, which is
significantly worsened from her baseline when she could walk
hundreds of feet without difficulty.  She reports using [**12-26**]
pillows at night under her head and develops SOB when lying
flat, though she did not experience this prior to her onset of
a-fib before [**Month (only) **] of this year. She denies chest/jaw/arm/back
pain, headache, vision changes, fevers, chills, abdominal pain,
nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, changes in bowel habits, dysuria, or
cough.

Of note, she had a TEE on [**6-15**] which showed 4+MR, 4+TR, mild AR,
biatrial enlargement, and EF>55%.

On arrival in the ED, her vitals were 98.6  96  106/78  16
97%RA.

All of the other review of systems were negative.

Of note, she was first diagnosed in A fib in [**2141-5-26**] where
she had A fib with RVR, during that admission she was
cardioverted and given sotalol. She was discharge home, then
readmitted for post-cardioversion pulmonary edema. She was
diuresed and pulmonary status improved. She declined potassium
and magnesium supplements and developed prolonged QTc in setting
of sotalol/hypokalemia/hypomag and then developed torsades and
cardiac arrest. She was transfered to CCU and given
isoproterenol, stopped sotalol, and repleted Mg and K and she
improved. She was then discharged to rehab on metop succ 150 and
verapamil 80 [**Hospital1 **].

Brief Hospital Course:
81 F with Hx of HTN, HLD, paroxysmal afib, moderate-severe
mitral regurgitation with acute diastolic CHF who is admitted
for A fib with RVR, now s/p amiodarone initiation, complicated
by hypotension requiring brief CCU care, and now stable and in
sinus rhythm.

ACTIVE ISSUES:
# Atrial fibrillation/Atrial flutter: Pt has had cardioversions
in the past 2 months, including elective and defibrillation, and
has failed sotalol (torsades). On admission, she was given
verapamil 40 [**Hospital1 **], metop succ 150, and started on amiodarone
400mg. The combination of all three agents was likely too much
AV nodal suppression, especially given her symptomatic
bradycardia to the 50s. Her amiodaron was temporarily changed to
200mg TID, with metoprolol tartrate to 12.5mg TID. Although her
dabigatran was temporarily held and heparin gtt started for
question of MVR and TV repair during this visit, this was
ultimately decided against and her dabigatran was restarted at
home dose. She has remained stable and in sinus rhythm since
[**7-8**]. She is being discharged on amiodarone 200mg [**Hospital1 **] and will
follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for further management
after going to her rehab care facility.

COMPLICATED BY:

#  Hypotensive Episode: While here, she was started on 400mg
amiodarone daily. She was continued on her home verapamil but at
a lower dose from 80mg [**Hospital1 **]->40 [**Hospital1 **], with cessation of her other
antihypertensives due to relative hypotension. on [**7-7**] she
reported feeling "ill." At 10am, shortly after getting her
verapamil, her HR dropped suddenly from 100s to 60s and then 50s
in slow A flutter with BP 60s/40s, though mentating well with
pulses present. A code blue was called for hypotension (BP 60s),
although pt maintained pulses throughout. She was given 1 L IVF,
Epi 1mg, 2g Calcium, Dopamine gtt started at 10 then dropped to
5. Her HR improved to 110, her BP improved to 120s, and she felt
improved. After arrival to CCU, she went to the cath lab for
right-sided pressures. Based on results, hypovolemia was most
likely etiology for hypotension in the seting of triple AV nodal
blocking agents (verapamil, metop, amiodarone) resulting in
hypovolemic shock without appropriate cardiac compensation.
After receiving 1 L IVF and discontinuing all antihypertensives
with exception of low-dose metoprolol, her condition improved
and she returned to the floor.
