Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4891**]
Chief Complaint:
shortness of breath


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2201-1-8**] endotracheal intubation


History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 3646**] is a 76 year old female with asthma requiring 2LNC at
home though no PFTs in the system and coronary artery disease
complicated by ischemic cardiomyopathy with LVEF of 35-40% on
TTE in [**2198**] who has had frequent ED visits and hospitilization
for shortness of breath this year.  She recently presented to
[**Hospital1 18**] ED on [**2200-12-11**] with asthma exacerbation and tranferred
to [**Hospital **] hospital per her wish.  At [**Hospital **] hospital, she was
treated for asthma exacerbation and discharged home.  She saw
her PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**12-30**].  SBP was 172.  Oxygen saturation was normal.
There was concern for running out of oxygen.  Home VNA:
[**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 86**] VNA [**Telephone/Fax (1) 44868**] who saw her last was concerned
about her medical noncompliance with her medications. She
presented to [**Location (un) **] ED on [**1-6**] with SOB and discharged that
day without any prednsione per patient.
.
She presents to ED last night with 7 days of shortness of
breath.
.
In the ED, initial VS were: 96.9 86 173/113 36 100% 15L
nonrebreather. ABG showed 7.49/35/45.  Labs were notable for
normal electrolytes, creatinine, troponin less than 0.01, BNP of
1080, HCT of 34, normal WBC and coags.  CXR showed no acute
process with mild hilar congestion.  EKG showed sinus rhythm
with IVCD and LVH without any acute ST-T changes compared to
prior EKG.  She was given combivent nebs X 2 and solumedrol
along with magnesium for asthama exacerbatoin.  She was given
levaquin for empiric coverage of community acquird pneumonia and
lasix IV 40 mg x 1 for acute on chronic systolic heart failure.
She was placed on BiPAP for hypoxemic respiratory failure with
imporvement to ABG of 7.42/42/479 and clinical improvement of
respiratory status.  Four hours later, she failed weaning off
BiPAP due to increase in respiratory effort.  She was
subsequently transferred to MICU for further evaluation and
management of hypoxemic respiratory failure.
.
.
On arrival to the MICU,  she reports feeling slightly better
though is a poor historian and her only complain is epigastric
pain.  She reports feeling short of breath for past seven days
but does not report fever, cough, chest pain, palpatations,
abdominal pain, nausea/diarrhea/joint pain/rash.  She does not
report sick contacts, eating out or high sodium intake.
.

IMAGING:
[**2201-1-8**] TTE: There is regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction with inferior hypokinesis similar to prior echo in
[**2198**]. There is an inferoposterobasal left ventricular aneurysm.
Left ventricular dyssynchrony consistent with left bundle branch
block. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal. There is an anterior space which most likely represents
a prominent fat pad.  LVEF 45%.
