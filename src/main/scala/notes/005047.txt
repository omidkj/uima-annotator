Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**Doctor First Name 1402**]
Chief Complaint:
lightheadedness

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Ablation of ventricular tachycardia via epicardial approach

History of Present Illness:
85 M h/o MI '[**82**] (no PTCA/CABG), VT (~[**2098**]), s/p ablation x 2
([**2099**] as part of study, [**2101**] [**2-27**] syncope), HTN, hyperlipid, in
USOH until ~9AM [**1-25**], when he developed "indigestion" (central
chest burning) a/w upper jaw discomfort, no SOB, n/v,
diaphoresis, palpitations, but also noted LH, so checked his BP,
which revealed HR 130s, SBP 102/60s, so he activated EMS and was
taken to OSH.
.
Initial EKG @ 4PM showed VT, HR=120s, CK 103, CKMB 3.2, Trop
0.05, BUN/Cre 27/2.0, initially some concern for STEMI, however
seen by cardiology, and not felt to be the case. Pt continued to
have +SOB and [**5-6**] CP @ OSH, however LH had resolved. He was
given amio iv x 1, the started on amio gtt, and given lidocaine
x 1, with persistent VT.
.
Admitted to ICU, with persistent VT, underwent DCCV for
sustained VT wiith SBP 90s at ~8PM [**1-25**], with breif reversion
to an av-paced rythym for ~1hr per pt and OSH EKG, however
rythym back to VT. Pt subsequently ([**1-26**] early AM) received
lidocaine 100mg bolus x 1, then lidocaine 90mg x 1 with HR down
to 115s. Neo gtt started [**2-27**] hypotension. Pt then given 5mg IV
lopressor ~6AM for unclear HR, BP without benefit, and received
500cc IVF bolus.
.
.
On review of symptoms, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
He denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other
review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence chest pain
prior to episode yesterday, no episodes of paroxysmal nocturnal
dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations,
.
pt notes stable DOE with climbing 1 flight of stairs, and 4
episodes of "total body fatigue" lasting 3-4hrs over past 6
weeks. He denies other any syncopal episodes since last VT
ablation ~3 yrs ago.

Ablation
A total of 2 LV epicardial ablations were performed for a total
of 81 seconds.
Conclusions
1) Ablation of late potentials on LV epicardial surface
performed via epicardial approach.
2) Unable to induce clinical VT.

Brief Hospital Course:
84 M h/o CAD, VT s/p ICD, ablation x 2 ([**2098**],[**2101**]), admitted to
OSH with CP and VT s/p DCCV x 1 with persistent VT.
.
# Ventricular tachycardia - h/o VT s/p ablation x 2, transferred
from OSH after amiodarone load and lidocaine x 1 with persistent
slow VT, hemodynamically stable. s/p RAMP pacing by EP fellow
and attg on [**1-26**], with subsequent resolution of VT. S/p
ablation- underwent minimal epicardial ablation but could not
induce VT to undergo endocardial ablation. Had some
hemopericardium post procedure. Therefore drain left in place
and remained intubated overnight. The following day drain was
removed and patient was successfully extubated without
difficulty. He remained [**Hospital1 **] V paced for the duration of his stay
with no further episodes of ventricular tachycardia. Discharged
on amiodarone.

.
# CAD/Ischemia: no evidence of ischemia. No EKG changes
suggestive of ischemia.
- continued on aspirin and coreg.
.
# Pump: pt euvolemic on clinical exam; not in decompensated
heart failure.  Repeat ECHO showed moderately depressed (LVEF=
30 %) secondary to akinesis of the inferior and posterior walls.
- continued home regimen of digoxin 0.1875.
- continue home regimen of lasix 40mg po bid
.
# Valves: 1+ aortic regurgitation per most recent ECHO done on
this admission; trivial MR/TR.
.
# Right femoral hematoma: patient completed Right groin
ultrasound notable for AV fistula. Evaluated by vascular surgery
who felt as no active issues at this time and patient should be
followed up in the outpatient setting.
.
# HTN: normotensive currently, continued home regimen of coreg.

.
# hyperlipidemia - continued home regimen of lipitor 10mg po
qdaily, and gemfibrozol.
.
.
# CKD - baseline 1.9-2.0 etiology unclear, pt currently at
reported baseline. Creatinine remained stable at baseline
.
# h/o gout - continued home dose allopurinol
.
# AAA (4.4 cm, dx [**7-3**], stable on repeat imaging 12/07 per pt)
- continue antihypertensives (coreg only).
- outpt f/u per PCP.
.
# GERD - continued omeprazole.
.
# thrombocytopenia - baseline 100-240s, currently low 100s,
- wnl
.

# Code: DNR/DNI. discussed extensively with pt and daughter, pt
does not want CPR or intubation. however external defibrillator
shocks are okay, epinephrine and pressors are ok.
