Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1167**]
Chief Complaint:
Palpitations, Chest Pressure

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Atrial Flutter Ablation
Hemodialysis


History of Present Illness:
Briefly, this is a 37 YOM with history of ESRD [**1-17**] hypertension
vs. glomerulonephritis on dialysis M/W/F s/p 2 failed kidney
transplants, hyperparathyroidism, severe pHTN presenting with
one week of racing heart.
.
He says this is associated with non-radiating left sided chest
pressure and shortness of breath (no particular trigger, but
occasionally worse with lying down). He felt this was likely due
to fluid overload but did not improve with dialysis. He has also
had nasusea and vomitting which has been a chronic problem for
him but worsened over the past week with associated diarrhea. He
has been eating and drinking well and does not feel dehydrated.
In fact, he feels a bit fluid overloaded, especially in his
face. He has also had ongoing body aches. Of note, he is not
taking any of his medications, including labetolol and
nifedipine.
.
He gets dialysis at [**Location (un) **] M/W/F in [**Location (un) **]. He says
yesterday's session removed 3.3L of fluid. He also has a history
of hyperparathyroidism for which he was at a scheudled
appointment with his surgeon on day of admission. His surgeon
noted tachycardia and referred him to the ED.
.
Of note, he had a CT of his chest two days prior to admission to
evaluate his systemic vascular flow. This showed unchanged
adenopathy and right axillary edema and extensive venous
collateralization in the chest wall which was also unchanged.
.
CT also showed heavy atherosclerotic coronary calcification,
Aortic valvular calcification which could be hemodynamically
significant, and unchanged Moderate-to-severe global
cardiomegaly unchanged.
.
In the ED, VS were 98.1 128 139/86 18 99% ra.
.
EKG showed aflutter with rate of 129, LAD, and LAFB. Trop was
0.43 but within past baselines.
.
He received 1L IVF, and dilt boluses which did not alter his
heart rate. He also received metoprolol 15mg IV. He was given
zofran and reglan given for vomiting
.
He was initially admitted to medicine. Echo this morning
demonstrated normal EF but very dilated RV with free wall
hypokinesis as well as abnormal systolic septal motion/position
consistent with right ventricular pressure overload. There is
severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
.
Hospital course has been complicated with hypoglycemic episodes
that coincide with hypotension (down to 80s) and elevated
lactate. He also gets an acutely rigid abdomen when he is
hypoglycemic and hypotensive. Pt has been transferred to the
MICU twice for these episodes. He's been treated with D5W @
50/hr and briefly covered with broad spectrum antibiotics
(vanc/zosyn).
.
On [**3-7**], he had HD with significant fluid removal (3 L removed).
He was uneventful all day until 5pm, pt had episode of BP 80s,
and bradycardia to 30s. His troponins remained stable although
he had some TWIs. He ws given D5W IVF and sugars improved to
high 80s. Lactate noted to be 6->11 x 3 despite IVFs (received
total 1.5L). He also spiked a Temp to 100.8.
.
A CT scan [**3-10**] showed cecal wall thickening and occlusion of his
[**Female First Name (un) 899**]. Thus, there was a thought that he gets transient mesenteric
ischemia when he is hypotensive. He was evaluated by transplant
surgery and vascular surgery for possible mesenteric ischemia,
however, they do not think that this is the case because there
is retrograde flow through the [**Female First Name (un) 899**] suggesting great collateral
supply to this territory. Also, the [**Female First Name (un) 899**] does not supply the
cecum which was the only part of the bowel that looked
inflammed/ischemic. Thus, he has been covered empirically with
vanc/zosyn for possible septic etiology given no better
explanation. His cultures have been negative and he remained
hemodynamically stable. His lactate and hypoglycemia improved.


Past Medical History:
1. ESRD on HD for at least ten years, felt to be due to
longstanding hypertension vs glomerulonephritis
- HD at [**Location (un) **] [**Location (un) **], T/Th/Sat, followed by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]
[**Name (STitle) 805**]
- s/p two failed kidney transplants, most recently in [**4-/2188**]
2. HTN, longstanding, poorly controlled
3. Chronic abdominal pain, s/p workup in [**3-/2190**] including normal

US, EGD with esophagitis and several large duodenal ulcers.
4. Hypercholesterolemia
5. Anemia
6. GIB, likely hemorrhoidal

Social History:
Lives with brother, denies smoking, ETOH. Some marijuana use.


Family History:
Grandmother and mother with possible history of diabetes. Sister
with ESRD, possibly due to HTN.
