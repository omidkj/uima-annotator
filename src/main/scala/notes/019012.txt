Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 106**]
Chief Complaint:
Transfer from OSH with syncope and polymorphic VT

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Temporary pacer wire moved to coronary sinus [**1-16**], removed [**1-18**];
Right subclavian line placed by IR [**1-21**]

History of Present Illness:
64 yo F with ESRD on HD secondary to membranoproliferative
glomerulonephritis and cirrhosis listed for combined
liver/kidney transplant who was initially admitted to [**Hospital3 12748**] from dialysis on [**2137-1-14**] for syncope. She had
recurrent episodes of tosade de point requiring defibrillation
x2, Amiodarone, and epi. Bedside echo revealed global LV
dysfunction with an EF of 20%. Her QTc was noted to be >600 ms.
[**Name13 (STitle) **] initial K was 3 and her Mg was 1.3 which were repleted. She
had recurrent episodes for polymorphic VT again requiring
defibrillation. A temporary pacer wire was placed for overdrive
pacing in her Right Subclavian. Her BP dropped and she was
started on Neo and Levophed prior to transfer. She had 2 sets of
negative cardiac enzymes with a mildly elevated trop I of 0.67
(0-0.5) on her third set. She had a low grade temp with a 10%
bandemia. She received one dose of vanco and gent at 1PM on
[**2137-1-15**].
.
Upon arrival to [**Hospital1 18**] she again went into polymorphic VT. First
episode broke with coughing. Within 5 minutes went into VT again
with pre-syncope requiring shock with 200 J. Her pacer was
adjusted; now rate set at on demand 84 and sensitivity 0.2.
Pacer was advanced 2 cm. Her K, Mag, and Ca were repleted.
A-line placed. Levophed was weaned off. Her blood pressure
improved when she was in sinus without pacing. She was continued
on Neo. Additional PIV's were placed.

Social History:

with her husband. Heavy EtOH use in the past; quit [**2107**]. Quit
smoking 10 yrs ago; previous 1 ppd x30+ years. Denies IVDA.
First blood transfusion 2 months ago.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 64 yo F with ESRD on HD and cirrhosis presents with
recurrent episodes of torsades de point (QTC 600's) and new LV
dysfunction, AMS and hypoxia.
.
She was initially having episodes of torsades with QTc >600,
requiring defibrilation with external shocks. She had a
temporary pacer wire that was placed at the OSH prior to
transfer that was used for overdrive pacing. The long QTc was
thought possibly [**1-11**] celexa vs. flexeril. Electrolytes were
aggresively repleted and the QTc became progressively shorter so
temp pacer was removed. However her mental status deteriorated,
thought [**1-11**] uremic vs. hepatic encephalopathy. She was not able
to have HD via her fistula as this was thrombosed. She was able
to have an HD cath placed but did not tolerate CVVH well. She
developed hypoxia wiht respiratory fatigue which triggered a
family discussion regarding decision to intubate. She was given
antibotics to treat possible aspiration pneumonia and CVVH was
attempted to decrease pulmonary edema but she did not tolerate
this secondary to hypotension. It was decided that she should
not be intubated. She expired from respiratory failure secondary
to pneumonia and pulmonary edema.
