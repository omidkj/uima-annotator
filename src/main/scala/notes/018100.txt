Cardiac Echo Conclusions:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and global
systolic function (LVEF>55%). There is mild (non-obstructive)
focal hypertrophy of the basal septum. There is considerable
beat-to-beat variability of the left ventricular ejection
fraction due to an irregular rhythm/premature beats. There is no
ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and
free wall motion are normal. The aortic root is mildly dilated
at the sinus level. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is mild
aortic valve stenosis (valve area 1.2-1.9cm2). No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate [2+] tricuspid
regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
preserved global and regional biventricular systolic function.
Mild calcific aortic stenosis. Mild mitral and moderate
tricuspid regurgitation. Moderate pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension.

Renal Ultrasound IMPRESSION: No evidence of hydronephrosis,
masses, or stones. Echogenic kidneys with evidence of chronic
renal disease. Limited doppler examination shows patent renal
arteries and renal veins bilaterally. Doppler waveforms indicate
increased bilateral resistance to diastolic flow.

UNILAT UP EXT VEINS US Study Date of [**2112-10-3**]
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of deep vein thrombosis in the left upper
extremity.
2. Superficial thrombus noted in the left cephalic vein, below
the level of the left antecubital fossa.
3. Subcutaneous edema in the region of the left antecubital
fossa

________________________________________________
ERCP Procedures: A 9cm by 10FR Cotton [**Doctor Last Name **] biliary stent was
placed successfully in the main duct due to the high suspicion
for cholangitis.  No [**Known firstname **] pus was seen exiting the papilla
following stent placement.

Impression: Successful biliary cannulation.
Normal biliary tree and anatomy.
Normal size CBD given patient's age.
No pus seen exiting the papilla.
No evidence of extrinsic compression, no ductal abnormalities,
and no filling defects.
Cystic duct slowly filled with contrast and the gallbladder was
partially visualized.
Successful placement of 9cm x 10F Cotton [**Doctor Last Name **] biliary stent due
to the high LFTs, clinical suspicion for cholangitis, and
possibility of a small stone being missed on cholangiogram
contributing to symptoms.
Otherwise normal ercp to third part of the duodenum.

Recommendations: Please call Dr.[**Name (NI) 2798**] office at
[**Telephone/Fax (1) 2799**] with any further questions or concerns.
Please call the on call ERCP fellow at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 2756**] with any
immediate concerns such as fever, abdominal pain, bleeding,
following your procedure.
Return in 4 weeks for repeat ERCP with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for stent
pull and re-assessment of the duct.

Brief Hospital Course:
[**Age over 90 **]M with CHF, CKD, and HTN trasnferred from OSH with N/V,
hyperbilirubinemia, and bandemia consistent with biliary sepsis
s/p ERCP with stent placement s/p percutaneous drain placement.
.
# Septic shock from cholangitis: Patient presenting with sepsis
(elevated bands and tachycardia in setting of likely infection)
and cholestatic pattern of elevated LFTs as well as RUQ U/S with
distended GB consistent with biliary obstruction.  Underwent
successful ERCP [**9-19**] with stent placement and his LFTs have
been trending down. IR drain placed [**9-20**].   In terms of his
sepsis, lactates have trended down to normal, and no longer with
a pressor requirement.  Vancomycin was added to zosyn on [**9-19**]
for broader coverage.  Bile culture grew pan sensitive e.coli an
antibiotics were tailored to cipro/flagyl to complete a 2 week
course.  Given his ongoing pain, a cholecystostomy tube was
placed by Interventional Radiology.  The cholecystostomy tube
will need to remain in place for at least 3 weeks, per Su
