Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Succinylcholine / Penicillins / Sulfa (Sulfonamides)

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 348**]
Chief Complaint:
Respiratory distress

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation with subsequent extubation
Insertion of Right internal jugular central venous line with
subsequent removal
Insertion of Right peripherally inserted central catheter


History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 13512**] is a 44 year old female with significant CAD status
post multiple stents and CABG at age 34 who presented to [**Doctor First Name **] OSH
with 1 week of cough, dyspnea status post a Z pack, then
subsequently erythromcyin, now with worsening SOB and abdominal
pain. Transferred from outside hospital with decreased O2 Sats
and hypotension.
.
In ED, EKG w/ NSR, LBBB, q III (old), ST dep I (old). CXR at
that time was consistent with mild CHF. Her CK was 3277, Trop
0.02. Cr 4.5 (new, baseline 0.9). A CT of the abdomen was
negative for obstruction. No inflammatory changes. Unchanged
from [**2162**]. Foley cath shows 400cc yellow-brown urine output. She
had a recurrent episode of hypotension to 80's systolic,
otherwise asymptomatic at 1100, improved to 100's systolic after
250ccNS. Given hypotension/leukocytosis/cough, she was given
levofloxacin 250mg x 1 (after 2 sets of Blood cultures, and
urine culture sent). She was subsequently noted to be
increasingly somnolent/fatigued. Her ABG demonstrated
hypercarbic respiratory failure, with pH 7.08, pCO2 84, pO2 84.
Tox screen positive for cocaine and opiods.
.
From the ED, she was transferred to the MICU for respiratory
failure secondary to CHF/COPD Exacerbation, pneumonia, and
possibly opioid toxicity. She was intubated due to somnolence
and rising CO2 on BiPAP, treated with nebs, steroids,
levofloxacin, and was eventually weaned off on [**11-29**]. She no
longer required oxygen upon transfer to the floor.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 13512**] is a 44 year old female with extensive cardiac
history who presented with respiratory failure and acute renal
failure, with subsequent improvement.
.
#) Respiratory failure: The patient's presenting respiratory
failure was likely multifactorial with an element of CHF, COPD,
and opioid overdose. She was intubated in the unit but came to
the floor extubated and doing well from respiratory standpoint
with O2 sats in the mid 90s on room air.
- The patient was started on levofloxacin and vancomycin on
[**11-23**]. The plan was to complete a 14-day course which was to
finish on [**12-7**]. However, the patient signed out AMA on [**12-2**]
without receiving any prescriptions for her medications. She
stated to the nurse that she wanted to leave by 10:00 am on
[**12-2**]. As the patient's VNA services were not set up at that
time, it was not possible to discharge her. Apparently, the
patient came to the desk, dressed and ready to leave, at about
10:30 and then, without speaking with myself or another
physician on our team, ran to the elevators. She did sign an AMA
form. The patient did leave with a PICC line which was placed on
[**12-1**] without problem. Upon learning of the patient's leaving,
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] will try to contact her in regard to removal of the
PICC line.
- That patient's sputum on [**11-24**] showed gram negative rods,
otherwise sputums were negative.
- While admitted, she did receive albuterol/atrovent nebs and
fluticasone inhaler.
- She did not appear to be volume overloaded once she reached
the floor.
- Tox screen positive for cocaine and opiods on admission. The
patient was counselled to stop using these drugs as they clearly
are having adverse consequences on her health.
.
#) Coagulase negative bacteremia: While hospitalized, the
patient did receive vancomycin and levofloxacin as above which
was to finish on [**12-7**]. It was decided that the patient did not
require a TEE to evaluate for vegetations based on her sensitive
cultures and lack of new murmur.
- Gram stain from [**11-30**] antecubital area with gram positive
cocci and PMNs. Culture pending at time of discharge.
- Despite these positive cultures, the patient left the hospital
without any prescriptions as noted above.
.
#) ARF - On admission, the patient's creatinine was elevated
which was likely multifactorial from hypovolemia (in setting of
diuresis, poor forward flow) and rhabdomyloysis (? [**3-13**] cocaine
abuse vs med related from statin). The patient has a similar
history in the past when presented in [**2156**] with elevated
creatinine and CK. She also has a reported history of needing
dialysis at OSH in [**Month (only) 404**] for post MI renal failure.
- Her FENa on admission was <1% suggesting prerenal etio
