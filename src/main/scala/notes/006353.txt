expired

History of Present Illness:
Patient is a pleasant [**Age over 90 **] year old Russian speaking only female
with hypertension, CAD, CHF, s/p CVA, OA who presents with acute
onset SOB.  History obtained via RN interpreter.  Patient notes
worsening SOB for the last 3 days, most pronounced this a.m. She
was at [**Hospital 100**] Rehab where she resides when her O2 sat this a.m.
was noted to be in the 70s, 76% on 3L.  Placed on mask and
increased to 91% on 2L.  Got lasix 20 mg PO x 1 at 6 a.m. and
albuterol with little results, and was therefore tranferred to
[**Hospital1 18**] ED.  Patient denies any chest pain, pressure, jaw or arm
pain, palpatations, nausea, emesis.  Has chronic right sided
shoulder pain for which she receives oxycodone.  Related
dizziness, chronic, most related to change of position.  No LOC.
 No recent weight gain.  + orthopnea, no PND.
.
In the ED vitals were 97.4, 63, 129/67, 40, 98-100% NRB.
Received lasix 80 IV x 1 and placed on nitro gtt for preload
reduction.  Slowly weaned off NRB to CPAP for 2.5 hrs and then
transitioned to NC, 90% on 5L.  Put out 900 cc to lasix.  Given
ASA 325 x 1 and Started on nitro gtt, ASA 325 x 1, lasix 80 IV x
1, morphine 2 mg IV x 2.
.
On review of symptoms, she relates history of stroke.  No
history of TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism,
bleeding at the time of surgery, cough, hemoptysis, black stools
or red stools. She denies recent fevers, chills or rigors. +
right shoulder pain.  All of the other review of systems were
negative.

EKG: A-V paced, LBBB, LAD, no ST changes
CXR [**2119-4-30**]:
There is marked cardiomegaly, with dense mitral annulus
calcification.  The aorta is calcified and unfolded.  A
left-sided dual-lead pacemaker is present, with lead tips over
the right atrium and right ventricle.  There are diffusely
increased interstitial markings and more patchy alveolar
opacities in the bases.  There is left lower lobe collapse
and/or consolidation as well as possible consolidation at the
right base.  Probable small right pleural
effusion.
Compared with [**2118-9-29**], the cardiomediastinal silhouette is
grossly unchanged. The interstitial and alveolar opacities,
bibasilar collapse/consolidation, and effusion are new.
IMPRESSION:  Probable pulmonary edema, with bibasilar collapse
and/or
consolidation.  Probable small right effusion.
.
[**2119-4-26**] CT UP EXT:
IMPRESSION:
1.  Anterior dislocation of the right shoulder.
2.  Evidence of a small osseous Bankart lesion at the inferior
aspect of the glenoid.
3.  Moderate fluid in the bursa about the shoulder, with
peripheral
calcification, suggesting chronicity.
.
ECHO [**2119-2-23**]:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. The left atrium is
elongated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There are three
aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is no
pericardial effusion.
Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable
for review) of [**2113-4-10**] the ejection fraction has improved (EF
55-60%). Pulmonary hypertension is now detected. Tricuspid
gradient has increased from 26 to 46 mmHg.
.
CARDIAC CATH performed on [**2113-4-21**] demonstrated:
COMMENTS:
1. Selective coronary angiography in this left dominant system
revealed no hemodynamically significant coronary artery disease.
 Upon accessing the femoral artery, significant tortuosity of
the descending aorta was noted.
2. Left ventriculography revealed severe hypokinesis of the
anterolateral, apical, and inferoapical segments, with an
estimated
ejection fraction of 35%.  There was heavy mitral annular
calcification noted, but no mitral regurgitation.
3. Resting hemodynamic monitoring at the time of Fick
measurements
revealed normal left and right heart filling pressures (PCWP =
11 mm Hg, RVEDP = 7 mm Hg).  The calculated cardiac index by
Fick method was 2.7 l/min/m2.  There was no gradient across the
aortic valve.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Coronary arteries are without hemodyanamically significant
disease.
2. Moderate systolic ventricular dysfunction.
3. Heavy mitral annular calcification.
.
[**2113-4-21**] Persantine MIBI:
1) Partially reversible inferior and apical perfusion defect.
2)
Ejection fraction of 46% with inferior wall hypokinesis.

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient is a [**Age over 90 **] year old female with HTN, CAD, CHF (diastolic),
s/p CVA, presenting to the eD with SOB. Initially managed on the
Floor on [**Hospital Ward Name 121**] 6.
.
While on the floor she was given an additional 40mg IV lasix and
was (-)1300cc for her first 24 hours in the hospital. Her first
set of cardiac enzymes were negative and not cycled with repeat
TTE showing no change from last TTE in [**2-25**] but showed stable 2+
MR with severe RV dilation and pulm HTN but no new WMA. Of note
2/2 blood cx from admission grew GPC so she was started
empirically on vancomycin despite no fever or elevated WBC. Due
to hyponatremia suspectedly, she was not given lasix on [**5-1**] and
I/O were even while she underwent further workup including Chest
CT to eval for sign of amiodarone toxicity and this revealed
large effusions and septal thickeing concerning for CHF. This am
her SOB continued to get worse and trigger was called for
hypoxia. She was given 40mg IV lasix to which she put out 400CC
of urine and ABG revealed pH 7.34 pCO2 65 pO2
