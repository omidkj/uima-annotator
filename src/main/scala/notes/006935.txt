Brief Hospital Course:
Pt admitted to the hospital after a fall down 8 steps w/ +LOC.
Initially seen at [**Hospital3 **] prior to transfer to [**Hospital1 18**].
Pt w/ history of alcohol use vs abuse.  Pt was started on
dilantin for head injury.  He also received 1 dose of solumedrol
for traumatic optic neuropathy.  On day 2, pt was transferred to
the floor and was noted to be confused and disoriented.  He was
on a CIWA scale for alcohol withdrawal but it was unclear if his
confusion may have been exacerbated by the benzodiazepines.
Instead, haldol was used but with poor response, likely due to
insufficient dosing. Pt was then tried on zyprexa with good
results.  On day 4, pt was taken to the OR for PEG placement.
That night, he developed minimal respiratory stress thought to
be [**1-31**] upper airway edema.  he was transferred to the unit for
monitoring and he was ruled out for MI.  Chest xray showed
questionable infiltrate and he was started on levofloxacin for
possible respiratory infection.  The following day, he had
negative bilat lower extremity ultrasounds for thought that
tachypnea could be related to VTE.  He was transferred to the
floor and started on tube feeds.  By day of discharge, he was
afebrile, tolerating full strength tube feeds at goal, and was
not requiring medicine for agitation.  He is to complete a 10
day course of abx and was transitioned to lovenox from subcut
heparin.

He was discharged to inpatient rehab with neurosurgery,
opthalmology, plastic surgery, and trauma surgery follow up.
