Brief Hospital Course:
63 y/o M with HIV, HCV, IDDM, ESRD on HD recently s/p MRSA
bacteremia who is transferred from HD with fever, chills.  He
was transferred to MICU with MRSA bacteremia then transferred
back to floor on [**2125-11-18**].
.
1. MRSA bacteremia - Pt has h/o recurrent bacteremia with MRSA
thought due to line infections but concerning for another
source.  Pt has persistently refused MRI to evaluate for spine
osteo and refused TEE to r/o endocarditis.   He also refused
right upper chest wall u/s to evaluate for abscess.  Pt was
encouraged by PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] and primary team to pursue these studies,
but he preferred to go back to NH and discuss proceeding with
further work up with his PCP at [**Name Initial (PRE) **] later date.  During this
admission, pt had one set of blood cultures from [**2125-11-15**] that
was 2/2 bottles positive for MRSA. His femoral dialysis line was
removed on [**11-16**] and line tip was also +MRSA.  All other blood
cultures have been no growth to date.  Cultures from the right
anterior chest wound from OSH grew vancomycin resistant staph
aureus.  A culture from the wound with results pending at time
of discharge.  Please note, pt will need to be continued on
Vancomycin for another 7 days (ending on [**12-1**]).
It should be dosed at [**Location (un) **] dialysis center on tu/th/sa.
.
2. Resp distress - Upon admission, question of possible
aspiration pneumonia vs pulm effusion due to fluid overload on
initial CXR.  Pt was treated empirically with Levofloxacin and
Vanco. Pt had no e/o respiratory distress on the floor, he
denied any SOB/cough/sputum production. WBC count was not
elevated and his lung exam was clear. Pt does not appear
clinically to have a pneumonia, he maintains normal oxygen
saturations on room air.  However, he has a large neck
circumference and likely has obstructive sleep apnea, but does
not tolerate CPAP.  At time of discharge, patient was saturating
well on room air without respiratory distress.
.
3. CHF- Recent echo showed an EF of 50% and pt likely has
chronic diastolic dysfunction.  His BP remained stable on home
regimen of Metoprolol 25mg [**Hospital1 **] and he  relies on dialysis to
help remove additional fluid & prevent pulm edema.  Lung exam
was clear on the day of discharge.
.
4. Thrombosis - h/o multiple clots in grafts and IVC on chronic
coumadin. INR was therapeutic on the day of discharge at 2.1.
Coumadin should be continued at 5mg qhs and his INR should be
monitored and coumadin adjusted for a goal of INR of [**2-10**].
.
5. Hepatitis C: Hep C viral load was drawn and is currently
4,290. LFTs stable and pt has no documented h/o cirrhosis.  A
RUQ U/S was unremarkable.
.
6. HIV: His last CD4 count was 614 ([**4-14**]).  Pt maintained on
HAART, followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1057**].  Pt was maintained on home regimen
of indinavir, ritonavir, lamivudine and there was no need for
PCP [**Name9 (PRE) **] with CD4>200.  Pt will need to f/u with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1057**] for
primary care of his HIV & HAART therapy.
.
7. ESRD on HD: Pt had a Left Femoral dialys
