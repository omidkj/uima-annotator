Intracranial hemorrhage

History of Present Illness:
This is an 83year old man with a past medical history
significant for dementia, dm, htn, and TIAs who presents today
with confusion and vomiting. Apparently he was "acting confused
while driving" and was stopped by the police and taken to the
station and the car was towed. According to the daughter who
picked him up from the station, he was "confused," not talking
much and seemed lethargic when they brought him home. While at
home, he complained of neck pain (though this is not unusual for
him since an outbreak of zoster in that area 2yrs ago) but
continued to be "confused." His wife states (per [**Name (NI) **] physicians)
that at home, he went to the bathroom and she found him sitting
on the toilet vomiting. He was taken to an OSH where head CT
showed right parietal occipital intraparenchymal hemorrhage. He
was also noted to have ST depressions in V3-V6 and a troponin of
0.02 at the OSH. He was started on a nipride gtt for the BP at
the OSH and intubated for unclear reasons - presumably for
airway
protection. On arrival to [**Hospital1 18**], he was changed to labetolol gtt
because ruling in for MI. Cards was consulted and agreed he is
having NSTEMI, troponin currently 0.11. Heparin and asa,
however,
are contraindicated at this time.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr [**Known lastname 20296**] was admitted to the neurology ICU.  Etiology of this
bleed may be amyloid angiopathy, HTN, underlying mass lesion,
aneurysm or AVM.  His blood pressure was initially controlled
with labetolol drip until the patient developed bradycardia with
junctional escape beats.  He was found to have a NSTEMI on
admission.  He was seen by cardiology who recommended low dose
beta blocker 2.5mg q 6 h as tolerated for cardiac protection.
All sedation was held and the patient remained minimally
responsive.  Repeat head CT was done on [**8-29**] which showed:
stable extent of right parietal interparenchymal hemorrhage, but
new hypodense regions in bilateral cerebellar hemispheres as
well as within the right occipital lobe, likely relating to
evolution of infarction. His mental status remained poor and an
EEG was obtained to r/o seizure.  EEG showed a diffuse
encephalopathy without epileptiform activity.
His course was further complicated by development of pneumonia
with MSSA positive sputum.  He was treated with antibiotics.
Due to his continued poor mental status a repeat head CT was
obtained on [**8-31**] which revealed: Largely stable appearance of
right parietal intraparenchymal hemorrhage as well as multiple
infarcts of the cerebellum, right occipital lobe, and pons,
suggestive of an embolic mechanism to the posterior circulation.
Significant interval increase in mass effect and swelling of the
posterior fossa causing compression of the brain stem and fourth
ventricles as well as mild increase in ventricle size.  Results
were discussed with the family  and neurosurgery.  The family
declined placement of vent drain or other surgical measures
since a meaningful neurologic recovery was not likely.  Based on
the patient's known wishes, the family made him CMO after
lengthy discussions with SICU and neurology teams.  He expired
on [**9-1**]
