Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 4377**]
Chief Complaint:
Low back pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Ex-laparoscopy, retroperitoneal mass biopsy


History of Present Illness:
The Pt is a 75y/o F who transferred from OSH with worsening
renal failure, elevated uric acid and a newly diagnosed
abdominal mass. The pt was in USOH until 1 month ago when she
developed increasing low back pain. Three days prior to transfer
the pt developed abd pain intially located in the RLQ and later
radiating to LLQ as well as increased urinary frequency and
dysuria. She was admitted to an OSH where she left prior to
intervention. She then presented to her PCP and [**Name Initial (PRE) **] CT abdomen was
obtained demonstrating a large retroperitoneal mass, multiple
lymphadenopathies. She was also found to have a Cr of 1.9 and
was directly admitted to [**Hospital3 417**] medial center. There she
had a CXR which was WNL, renal ultrasound with no hydronephrosis
and a percutaneous biopsy of the retroperitoneum was performed.
Her labs were remarkable for uric acid 23, her creatinien went
from 1.9 to 2.5 in 24 h. The pt was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for
further management.
.
The pt was admitted to the BMT service. Given her elevated LDH,
uric acid and worsening renal failure she was given IV hydration
with bicarb, allopurinol and Rasburicase. Her retroperitoneal
mass was felt concerning for lymphoma and she underwent a CT
guided biopsy. Per report the CT guided biopsy yielded only
necrotic tissue. Urology was consulted for question of bladder
wall thickening. This pm pt underwent ex-lap and cystoscopy and
is transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for HD monitoring. OR cystoscopy
demonstrated that the left lateral wall has a smooth 1.5-2cm
area of invagination into the lumen of the bladder. This may be
a primary bladder mass or more likely, extrinsic compression of
the bladder by an external mass. Multiple core biopsies were
taken in OR. Estimated blood loss 600cc. Post-op the pt had low
BP and neo was started. She remained vented [**12-24**] poor reflexes
with sedation.
.
While in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], the patient was tx'd for TLS with bicarb
containing IVF. xfused 2u PRBCs for ~600ccs blood loss.
Extubated and started on clears. On cystoscopy was found to
have: OR "left lateral wall has a smooth 1.5-2cm area of
invagination into the lumen of the bladder. This may be a
primary bladder mass or more likely, extrinsic compression of
the bladder by an external mass." Transferred back to BMT
service for initiation of chemotherapy.

ABDOMEN AND PELVIC CT [**2130-4-19**]:
Spiral images of the abdomen and pelvis were obtained after the
administration of oral contrast material. No intravenous
contrast material was given due to renal insufficiency.
ABDOMINAL CT: The liver and spleen are normal in size without
focal defects. Gallbladder is partially contracted. Pancreas is
normal in size but there is peripancreatic adenopathy and
inflammation. There are multiple enlarged lymph nodes adjacent
to the aorta in the upper retroperitoneum. More distally a dense
conglomerate mass surrounds the aorta and IVC. Adenopathy
extends
into the pelvis along the iliac chains. There is infiltration of
the mesenteric fat anteriorly adjacent to the stomach and
transverse colon. Enlarged mesenteric nodes are present.
The small and large bowel have a normal diameter. There is no
free air in the peritoneal cavity. Renal contours are
unremarkable. There is no hydronephrosis or perinephric
collection.
PELVIC CT: There is bilateral pelvic adenopathy. Inflammatory
changes are present in the pelvic fat. There are a few enlarged
inguinal nodes bilaterally. The bladder is contracted. Bladder
is irregularly thickened possibly due to tumor infiltration.
Review at bone window settings shows degenerative changes in the
lumbar spine. There is disc space narrowing at L3-4 and L4-5.
Destructive lesions are demonstrated.
Lung bases are clear.
IMPRESSION:
Large retroperitoneal mass with mesenteric and pelvic
adenopathy, accompanied by inflammatory changes.
Wall of the urinary bladder is thickened possibly infiltrated by
tumor.
.
[**4-21**] ECHO
The left atrium is normal in size. The estimated right atrial
pressure is 0-5 mmHg. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity
size, and global systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%). Due to
suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality
cannot be fully excluded. Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a
normal left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The number of aortic valve
leaflets cannot be determined. There is no aortic valve
stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is moderate pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is a trivial/physiologic
pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Normal biventricular systolic function. Moderate
estimated pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.

Brief Hospital Course:
75 y/o F with no significant past medical history who presented
with new of abdominal/pelvic retroperitoneal mass and tumor
lysis syndrome, s/p intraop biopsies, with results consistent
with aggressive B cell lymphoma.
.
# B cell lymphoblastic follicular lymphoma:  She initially
presented from an OSH with a new abdominal and pelvic
retroperitoneal mass and with tumor lysis syndrome, with a uric
acid of 22 and in acute renal failure.  She was started on
rasburicase and allopurinol with improvement of her tumor lysis
labs.  On [**4-21**],  she underwent CT guided biopsy which yielded
necrotic samples. For definitive diagnosis, on that same date,
[**4-21**], she underwent an exploratory laparotomy with biopsy.  Due
to the vascular nature of the mass, her operative course was
prolonged and she was kept intubated and transferred to the ICU
following this procedure.  She also had a cystoscopy in the
operating room by the uro
