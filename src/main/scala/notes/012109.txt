Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5129**]
Chief Complaint:
Transferred for angio

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
initiation of hemodialysis
debridement of leg cellulitis
Right lower extremity angiograms/ angioplasty of Right ant/post
tib artery.


History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 66M with PMHx sig. for DM, HTN, recent onset afib
on coumadin, and PVD with chronic LE ulcers and cellulitis who
was transferred from [**Hospital 1562**] Hospital for angiogram of BLEs. He
had been admitted at [**Hospital1 1562**] on [**9-8**] with worsening LE ulcers
and LE edema. He had a 10 year history of bilateral LE ulcers
with eschar on the R leg accompanied with pain worse wtih
ambulation.
.
At [**Name (NI) 1562**], pt was in the MICU with septic shock from [**1-10**] blood
cultures positive for GBS on [**9-8**], has completed a course of ABX
(5 days vanc/zosyn), source felt to be from ulcers. His course
was complicated by ATN requiring 2 sessions of HD and afib with
RVR s/p cardioversion on [**2176-9-23**] (and found to have elevated
troponins) and initiation of amiodarone and coumadin.
.
Here, patient was scheduled for LE angiogram today. Nephrology
was consulted for recommendations with angiogram. However,
overnight, the patient was unresponsive to sternal rub. He
received Narcan 0.4 mg x 2 with response. Narcotics were
discontinued. ABG on CPAP was 7.35/41/56. At the time, VS were:
HR 60, BP 90/60-115/70, RR12, 96% on 4L. This morning he was
again found to be minimally responsive and then hypotensive with
systolic in 70s; HR was maintained in 50-60s. Repeat ABG was
7.34/44/82. Blood cultures were sent. Patient is not making
urine.


Past Medical History:
Chronic renal insufficiency (baseline cr 1.7), Stage III
OSA on CPAP
Gout on allopurinol and colchicine
Ulcerative colitis on chronic prednisone
Diabetes on insulin
Hypertension
Afib, newly diagnosed on coumadin
PVD with chronic lower extremity ulcers
Obesity


Social History:
Patient lives with his wife in [**Name (NI) 3320**]. Owns a liquor store. He
smoked 4ppd x 40 years, quit 4 years ago. Per surgical admission
note, he drinks 1-3 drinks/day, ~5 days per week.

Family History:
Non-contributory

Physical Exam:
T= 98.8 BP= 110/68 HR= 86 RR= 18 O2= 97% on RA
GENERAL: drowsy but arousable; A + O x 1
HEENT: Normocephalic, atraumatic. No conjunctival pallor. No
scleral icterus. MMM
Neck: Supple, No LAD; unable to assess JVD given anasarca
CARDIAC: irregularly irregular, S1 S2 systolic murmur
LUNGS: bilateral rhonchi and transmitted upper airway sounds
ABDOMEN: NABS. Soft, NT, ND. No HSM
EXTREMITIES: generalized anasarca; multiple full and partial
thickness ulcerations extending from dorsum of right lower
extremity to popliteal zone- currently wrapped in keflex
bandage.  Left heel necrotic ulcer
SKIN: generalized anasarca, scattered ecchymoses and petechia.
Multiple gouty tophi.  For full skin assessment please see wound
care assessment
NEURO:A+O x1; unable to fully assess given patient's mental
status

Pertinent Results:
CXR [**9-24**] - Lung volumes are very low. Mediastinal widening is
marked but symmetric. The patient is obese and therefore much of
the widening is due to fat deposition but adenopathy could be
present and the contour of the thoracic aorta is nearly entirely
obscured. Heart is enlarged but the contours are similarly
obscured. Gaseous distention of bowel loops in the upper abdomen
is not fully imaged. There is no free subdiaphragmatic gas, and
no pneumothorax or pleural effusion. Upper lungs are clear.
Lower lungs are largely obscured.
.
CT Head [**2176-9-26**]- No acute intracranial process.  The paranasal
sinuses are notable for opacification of the right anterior
ethmoid air cells as well as right frontal sinus.
.
CT Chest/ABD/PEL [**2176-9-26**] - 1. Bilateral pulmonary
consolidations with small pleural effusions as above, possibly
infectious given the provided history, though, given the
distribution in this patient with a nasogastric tube as well as
an endotracheal tube, aspiration is another consideration.
2. Extensive atherosclerotic disease involving the coronary
arteries as well as the aorta.
3. Infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm measuring 44 mm in
greatest diameter.
.
ECHO [**2176-9-26**] - Moderately dilated left and right ventricles
with normal left ventricular systolic function and mildly
depressed right ventricular function. Mild aortic stenosis.
Moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.  EF>55%.

LENI ([**2176-10-2**])-
IMPRESSION: No evidence of DVT.

CT Head ([**2176-10-13**])-
IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial process.

ANKLE FILMS ([**2176-10-13**])-
IMPRESSION: Bilateral extensive vascular calcifications.
Bilateral massive
degenerative diseases in the region of the forefoot.

Bilateral soft tissue swelling at the medial aspect of the first
and the
lateral aspect of the fifth toe, with accompanying cortical
defects, partly combined to sclerotic regions, suggesting either
active or recurrent osteomyelitis. Similar but less extensive
lesions are seen in the distal parts of the first and fifth toe
on the right and at the distal parts of the second and fourth
toe on the right, as well as at the distal parts of the fourth
toe on the left.

Renal U/S ([**2176-10-14**])-
1. Markedly limited study, but no hydronephrosis or renal stone.

2. Echogenic renal parenchyma consistent with medical renal
disease.

ECHO ([**2176-10-14**])-
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is
moderately dilated. Regional left ventricular wall motion is
normal. There is mild global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF
= 40-45 %). The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with
borderline normal free wall function. Intrinsic function may be
more depressed given the severity of tricuspid regurgitation.
The aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is
mild aortic valve stenosis (valve area 1.2-1.9cm2). No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
structurally normal. There is trivial mitral regurgitation.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is moderate
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2176-9-26**],
the left ventricular cavity size is smaller with mild global
hypokinesis, the severity of tricuspid regurgitation is
increased, and the rhythm is now sinus with ventricular
bigeminy. The severity of aortic stenosis and estimated PA
systolic pressure are similar.

EKG ([**2176-10-20**])- Wide complex tachycardia suggestive of atrial
tachycardia with frequent ventricular premature beats and
underlying right bundle-branch block with left anterior
fascicular block. Compared to the previous tracing of [**2176-10-14**]
there is no change.

CT Abd/Pelvis ([**2176-10-28**])- IMPRESSION:
1. Stable size of infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm.
2. Small bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left,
unchanged in size since the previous study. Slightly improved
bibasilar consolidations.`

Chest X-Ray ([**2176-11-4**])-
IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**10-20**]:

Dobbhoff tube has been replaced by a standard nasogastric tube
which passes into the stomach and out of view before the tip
returns to the left upper quadrant. The extent of redundancy is
therefore impossible to assess. Right jugular line introducer
ends in the upper SVC. Small right pleural effusion is likely,
decreased since [**10-20**]. Mild-to-moderate bibasilar
atelectasis stable. Upper lungs clear. No pneumothorax. Cardiac
silhouette is probably top normal size and unchanged.

MRI Head ([**2176-11-2**])-
IMPRESSION: No acute infarct seen. Multiple small cortical
infarcts are
noted which appear subacute to chronic. Limited post-gadolinium
images
demonstrate no obvious enhancement.
