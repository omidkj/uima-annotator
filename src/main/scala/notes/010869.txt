History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 73 y/o M hx prosthetic hip joint complicated by
hemorrhage into joint, recently admitted on [**2172-12-19**] to OSH for
septic shock and s/p joint removal. He subsequently developed
enterococcus bacteremia and possible aortic valve endocarditis
and has been on ampicillin (day 1= [**12-29**]) and gent (Day 1=[**1-6**]).
He was intubated this admission and remained difficult to wean
(was extubated for 2 days last week, but required
re-intubation), and he is now transferred for trach and peg. It
was felt that he was hard to wean from vent due to volume
overload despite trying lasix/albumin. Also, some question of
edematous vocal cords when seen by ENT. His hospital course has
also been complicated by elevated LFTs and recent RUQ U/S with
dilated common bile duct.
.
Per family, he has had a prolongued course since [**9-23**] of
hemorrage/hematoma into his replaced R hip which was surgically
drained X 2.
.
On the floor, he is intubated and sedated. Most history obtained
from OSH records and family

[**1-14**] Portable AP Chest

IMPRESSION: Intubated, status post bypass surgery with cardiac
enlargement,
pulmonary congestive pattern indicating severe CHF with
bilateral pleural
effusion. No pneumothorax. No previous films available for
comparison.

[**1-14**] Abdominal U/S

IMPRESSION:
1. Equivocal, mild dilation of the common duct. No calculi
identified in the
common duct.
2. Multiple small stones in the gallbladder neck, but no
evidence of acute
cholecystitis.
3. Trace ascites. Incidentally noted right pleural effusion.

[**1-15**] EKG

Atrial fibrillation with controlled ventricular response. Right
bundle-branch
block. Diffuse non-specific ST segment abnormalities. No
previous tracing
available for comparison.

[**1-15**] ECHO

The left atrium is markedly dilated. The right atrium is
markedly dilated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. There
is moderate to severe global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF
= 30 %). There is no ventricular septal defect. The right
ventricular cavity is dilated with severe global free wall
hypokinesis. There is abnormal systolic septal motion/position
consistent with right ventricular pressure overload. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is
not present. No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic
valve, but cannot be fully excluded due to suboptimal image
quality. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. No masses or vegetations are seen on the mitral valve,
but cannot be fully excluded due to suboptimal image quality.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. No masses or vegetations
are seen on the tricuspid valve, but cannot be fully excluded
due to suboptimal image quality. There is severe pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. No masses or vegetations are seen
on the pulmonic valve, but cannot be fully excluded due to
suboptimal image quality. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: no obvious vegetations; the right ventricle is
severely hypocontractile and dilated
If clinically suggested, the absence of a vegetation by 2D
echocardiography does not exclude endocarditis.

[**1-15**] CTA Chest

IMPRESSION:
1. No central pulmonary embolus.
2. No bowing of the intraventricular septum to suggest increased
right heart
pressures.
3. Large bilateral pleural effusions with associated relaxation
atelectasis.
4. Pronounced vascular calcifications including ubiquitous
coronary artery
calcifications.
5. Pneumoperitoneum likely secondary to PEG tube placement;
correlate
clinically.
6. Moderate ascites

[**1-17**] Hand xray

Two radiographs of the right hand demonstrate severe
osteoarthritis of the
first CMC joint. There is a comminuted fracture involving the
middle phalanx
of the fifth finger. There is soft tissue swelling overlying the
fracture
site. Assessment is somewhat limited by radiopaque pulse
oximeter and patient
positioning. Atherosclerotic calcifications are noted. Overall
mineralization is normal. No previous studies are available for
comparison.


Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 72 y/o M hx PAF, CAD s/p CABG, R hip replacement c/b
joint enterococcus infection, sepsis, prolonged intubation
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for trach and peg.

# Respiratory failure: Most likely multifactorial with volume
overload, systolic failure, and deconditioning, body habitus.
Low suspicion for pulmonary infection at this point given lack
of fever, leukocytosis, infiltrate on CXR. Pt had tracheostomy
and PEG on [**1-15**]. Pt was diuresed approximately 5L over the
hospital course. On [**1-16**] sedation was lightened.  Pt was
transitioned to PSV with brief periods of MMV for apnea.  On [**1-19**]
pt tolerated a trach mask for the majority of the day at 30-50%
FiO2. Pt will need to continue with gentle daily diuresis on
lasix 60mg IV BID prn, goal of returning to dry weight over next
2-3 weeks.
.
# Septic joint/bacteremia: Pt had antibiotic spacer placed in
hip joint from OSH.  Daily blood cultures revealed
Corynebacterium on [**1-16**] that was felt to be a contaminant given
that all other blood cultures were negative or pending at time
of discharge. Orthopedics was consulted regarding the hip joint
and they felt that a joint replacement would be necessary at a
later date.  The pt was to follow-up as an outpatient.  Pt
started ampicillin on [**12-29**] and gentamicin on [**1-6**].  Pt completed
10-day course of gentamicin and will need to complete a 6-week
course of ampicillin, last day of Ampicillin will be [**2173-2-9**].
Pt will be seen in follow up at [**Hospital 18**] [**Hospital 1957**] clinic on [**2-18**]
at 1pm.
.
# Possible Endocarditis: Pt underwent TEE at the OSH that
revealed mobile vegetations on his aortic valve.  He was started
on ampi
