History of Present Illness:
71 y/o female with CAD, AS, and PVD who presented to [**Hospital 1474**]
hospital on [**2195-7-2**] with dyspnea for one month, worse over the
preceeding week with cough but no clear fevers. Vitals were
98.7, 124/69, 91, and 94% on 2L/M O2 on presentation. CXR showed
cardiomegaly with mild [**Date Range 1106**] congestion. Labs showed a WBC

Pertinent Results:
[**2195-7-6**] Cardiac Cath:
COMMENTS:
1.  Coronary angiography in this right-dominant system
demonstrated
2-vessel disease.  The LMCA had 50% stenosis at its origin with
noted
dampening of pressure.  The LAD had moderate diffuse disease.
The LCx
was a non-dominant vessel without critical lesions.  The RCA was
a
dominant vessel with previous stent origin 90% stenosis.
2.  Resting hemodynamics revealed elevated left-sided filling
pressures
with LVEDP of 40.  There was moderate pulmonary arterial
systolic
hypertension with PASP of 58.  The cardiac output was preserved
at 5.71
L/min.
3.  There was severe aortic stenosis with a peak to peak
gradient of 60
mmHg, mean gradient of 41 mmHg and aortic valve area of 0.8 cm2.

4.  The aortic root and arch were noted to have significant
calcifications.
.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Two vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Severe aortic stenosis.
3. Elevated left-sided filling pressures and moderate pulmonary
artery
systolic hypertension.
.
[**2195-7-4**] Echo:
Conclusions:
The estimated right atrial pressure is 11-15mmHg. There is mild
symmetric left  ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular
cavity size is normal. There is  mild to moderate global left
ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 40 %). Tissue  Doppler imaging
suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure
(PCWP>18mmHg). There is no ventricular septal defect. Right
ventricular  chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There
is severe aortic valve  stenosis (area <0.8cm2). Mild (1+)
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral  valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse.  Trivial
mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are
mildly  thickened. There is no pericardial effusion.

.
[**2195-7-9**] Chest CT:
IMPRESSION:
1.  Bilateral moderate to large dependent simple pleural
effusions.
2.  Bilateral dependent pulmonary opacities, which may be due to
a combination of atelectasis and provided history of pneumonia.
A 1.5 cm diameter rounded lucency in superior segment left lower
lobe may represent underlying pneumatocele or bulla, but a focus
of necrotizing pneumonia is difficult to exclude given adjacent
pleural effusion and absence of intravenous contrast. If
warranted clinically, a followup contrast enhanced chest CT
could be considered, ideally following thoracentesis, for more
complete evaluation of this region.
3.  Emphysema.
4.  Coronary artery and aortic valvular calcifications.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 4223**] was admitted to the CCU for invasive monitoring and
mechanical ventilation. She was started on levofloxacin,
vancomycin and zosyn for CAP. She was transfused for a
hematacrit of 22. She was seen by renal for likely atn and
contrast nephropathy from cath. She was started on tube feeds.
Cardiac cath on 8.20 showed 50% LM, moderate diffuse LAD
disease, 90% RCA. She was seen by cardiac surgery for AVR/CABG,
and awaited diuresis, plavix washout and possible extubation
prior to surgery. Cautious diuresis was attempted given her
severe AS. On [**7-9**] she underwent thoracentesis. Pressure support
trial was unsuccessful as was steroid taper and she remained
intubated. On [**7-16**] she ws taken to the operating room where she
underwent a CABG x 2 and AVR (porcine). She was transferred to
the ICU in critical but stable condition on epi, neo, propofol
and insulin. She remained intubated. She ws startd on amiodarone
 for post op atrial fibrillation. She was seen by general
surgery for abdominal pain, increased pressor requirement and
increased LFTs. She did not require surgery, and her LFTs
improved. She continued on tube feeds postoperatively.
Aggressive diuresis continued.  She was weaned from her
vasoactive drips. She was seen by thoracic surgery for trach and
PEG, which was performed on [**2195-7-24**]. The ventilator was weaned
and she was screened for rehab. She was ready for discharge to
rehab on [**2195-7-29**].
