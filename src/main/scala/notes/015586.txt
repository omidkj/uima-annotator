Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1430**]
Chief Complaint:
Recurrent ventral herniation with omentum up in the anterior
chest

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Ventral hernia repair, placement of SurgiMend and omentectomy.
Sternal plate removal.


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 27218**] is a 72 y.o. male with PMH significant for CAD s/p
CABG ([**2131-5-4**]), COPD, HTN who presents with recurrent ventral
hernia.

Approximately three years ago ([**2131-5-18**]), the patient had a
sternal repair done with plates. He had an omental transfer and
at that time a ventral hernia repair to the anterior fascia at
the bottom of sternotomy lead to a hernia. This was actually
repaired primarily and reinforced with mesh. A separate new hole
was made through the diaphragm for the omental transfer. Over
time omentum and bowel has protruded up through this hole in the
diaphragm, as evidenced on a recent CT. He now comes in for
repair of this defect. In addition was planning on removal of
his plates as he was having some discomfort. He understood we
could not guarantee success and further intervention may be
required.

Blood and sputum cx - No Growth to date.

ECG ([**2134-5-11**]) - Sinus rhythm. Normal tracing. Since the previous
tracing of [**2134-5-4**] sinus bradycardia is absent.

CXR ([**2134-5-11**]) - Mild bibasilar atelectasis documented on the CTA
performed subsequently, 8:00 a.m. on [**5-12**] and available at the
time of this dictation, in combination with pulmonary embolism
demonstrated on that study is sufficient to explain hypoxia.
There is no pulmonary edema. Heart size is probably normal and
unchanged. There is no pulmonary edema. Left pleural thickening
is chronic.

Echo ([**2134-5-12**]) - The left atrium is mildly dilated. The right
atrium is moderately dilated. No atrial septal defect is seen by
2D or color Doppler. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with normal cavity size and global systolic function
(LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall
motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. There is no
ventricular septal defect. RV appears to have normal free wall
contractility (poor image quality). There is abnormal septal
motion/position. The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus
level. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Tricuspid
regurgitation is present but cannot be quantified. There is
moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2131-5-19**],
the RV funciton has probably improved. If indicated, a cardiac
MRI may better assess RV size and systolic function.

CXR ([**2134-5-12**]) - IMPRESSION: Asymmetric pulmonary edema, new since
one day prior.

CTA Chest ([**2134-5-12**]) - IMPRESSION:
1. Left upper lobe lobar pulmonary embolism.
2. Partial right lower lobe collapse due to a combination of
dependent secretions and bronchial wall thickening, with
associated surrounding peribronchial lymph nodes which are
probably reactive; however, a followup CT is recommended in four
to six weeks to ensure resolution.
3. Diffuse ground-glass opacities superimposed on centrilobular
emphysema are most likely infectious (such as viral in origin);
aspiration and asymetrical edema are less likely.
4. Large fatty lesion posterior to the left scapula contains
internal septations; considering large size and septations, a
dedicated MRI with contrast is recommended for further
evaluation to help distinguish a lipoma from a low grade
liposarcoma.
5. New ventral hernia mesh with postoperative changes in the
soft tissues of the anterior chest and upper abdomen.
6. Diffuse coronary artery calcification with CABG.

Bilateral LENIs ([**2134-5-13**]) - IMPRESSION: No evidence of DVT of
bilateral lower extremities.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was taken to the operating room for a joint
procedure between Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] of plastic surgery and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
of general surgery.  He [**Last Name (STitle) 1834**] the following procedures:
(1) Repair of chest wall hernia (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
(2) Ventral hernia repair, placement of SurgiMend and
omentectomy. Sternal plate removal (Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **]
.
The patient tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to
the floor for routine post operate care.  He initially had poor
pain control and his PCA was titrated up.  He was kept strictly
NPO until return of bowel function.  Unfortunately, he developed
acute respiratory distress during the early morning hours of
[**2134-5-12**] that necessitated transfer to the medical intensive care
unit.
.
# Pulmonary: On POD 2, the patient was transferred to the ICU
for ongoing respiratory distress and hypoxia. He had been on 4L
NC since he was in the OR; however, he desaturated to the high
80's. Also, he had had ongoing difficulty with deep breaths
secondary to abdominal pain. CTA during this decompensation
showed pulmonary embolism. Imaging was also concerning for
underlying pneumonia as well as fluid overload. Shortly after
transfer to the ICU, the patient was noted to have worsening
hypercarbic respiratory failure and depressed mental status.
Ultimately, he was intubated on [**2134-5-12**]. The patient was started
on antibiotics to cover for his pneumonia (see below). Diuresis
was intially limited [**2-9**] hypotension; however, his blood
pressures improved and he was ultimately diuresed. After a few
days of antibiotics and diuresis, the patient's respiratory
status improved. His sedating medications were weaned and he was
ultimately extubated on [**2134-5-15**]. He was called out to the floor
on the day following his extubation and remained stable from a
pulmonary standpoint.
.
During the initial workup of his respiratory distress, a left
upper lobe lobar pulmonary embolism was noted on CTA. Of note,
patient does have a history of clots right femoral vein, left
IJ, superficial veins of the left and right cephalic veins,
superficial left basilic vein, and pulmonary embolism in setting
of surgery for cardiac tamponade s/p CABG [**5-14**]. Per Hematology
