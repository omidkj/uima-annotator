History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 67-year-old woman
who had had a COPD flare requiring intubation in [**Month (only) 116**] of this
year. She was unable to wean from the vent until a tracheal Y
stent was placed. This was secondary to the observation of
severe tracheobronchomalacia. The patient noted that her
overall level of functionality which had been reduced
secondary to severe dyspnea on exertion was markedly better
following placement of the Y stent, specifically in
comparison to her preintubation level of performance. Despite
her severe COPD, after multidisciplinary consideration of her
case, the recommendation to proceed with surgical
tracheoplasty and bronchoplasty was made as her response to
stenting was so profoundly good.

CXR [**11-25**]
PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS: The patient is status post
removal of the right apical pleural drain. After accounting for
slight differences in patient positioning, there is likely no
change to small right apical pneumothorax. Again seen is a
lateral component, with an air-fluid level. The appearance of
the right lateral hydropneumothorax is unchanged and probably
partially loculated. Severe subcutaneous emphysema in the right
thoracoabdominal wall and both sides of the neck may be slightly
improved compared to [**2131-11-22**]. The heart size is normal and no
pneumomediastinum is evident on the current study. The left lung
is again hyperinflated but clear.


Brief Hospital Course:
pt was admitted to the hospital on [**2131-11-12**] for bronchoscopy to
eval for TBM and subsequent tracheoplasty. Pt underwent the
following PROCEDURES:
1. Flexible bronchoscopy.
2. Tracheoplasty with mesh.
3. Right mainstem bronchus and bronchus intermedius
    bronchoplasty with mesh.
4. Left mainstem bronchoplasty with mesh.
5. Right upper lobe apical wedge resection.
tracheoplasty
OR course wasuneventful. Post operatively, pt had an epidural
for pain control, a right chest tube for pleural drainage and
was admitted to the SICU for ongoing pulmonary assessment and
care.
Pt was d/c'd from the ICU on POD#2
She progressed quickly post operatively. Her chest tube and
epidural were removed on POD#4. subsequently she developed large
amounts of SQ air over the right chest, back, neck and face. The
sq air remained stable and slowly decreased over POD#'s [**5-20**] On
POD#7 she had a bronch to eval her plasty prior to d/c home and
had a severe resp decompensation requiring ICU admission. A
right anterior dart was placed for decompression of PTX. It was
presumed she had reactive airway rxn to the bronch and was
treated w/ IV steriods and high flow oxygen. She refused
non-invasive ventialtion d/t severe anxiety. She did well and
transferred out of the ICU on POD#8.
the dart was placed to water seal on POD# 8 w/ stable cxr.
she was on empiric levo, vanco until BAL from [**11-20**] grew out
proteus and she was started on meropenum. At the time of
discharge, after consultation w/ ID she was switiched to
ertapenum to complete a 7 day course of antibiotics total. A
midline was placed for home IV therapy. The dart was d/c'd on
POD#12 w/ stable cxr.
