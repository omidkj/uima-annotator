Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 45**]
Chief Complaint:
Rib pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation
Stress MIBI


History of Present Illness:
71 y/o F w/ metastatic breast ca, w/ bone involvement, on
tamoxifen, who presents with worsening right rib pain.
.
She reports that rib pain has been a chronic problem, but has
been worse over past one week. The right side is worse, but she
also reports left sided rib pain and chest wall pain. She does
not report any trauma or heavy lifting or turning that seemed to
precipitate the pains. She was recently started on percocet for
pain which did help, but she has had to take it around the clock
without full relief.
.
ROS: denies n/v/f/c. no chest pain. + shortness of breath-
secondary to not able to take in full breaths from pain in right
side; No associated rash; + constipation.
.
In ER, given oxycodone 10mg, flexerill 10mg, and 10mg oxycontin.
However continued pain, therefore admitted for pain control


Past Medical History:
1. Hypertension
2. Glaucoma
3. Breast cancer
4. Rib pain
5. Atrial fibrillation
.
ONCOLOGIC HISTORY: Initially diagnosed in spring of [**2110**] with a
dimpling in her right breast and a positive mammogram.
Excisional biopsy demonstrated infiltrating and intraductal
carcinoma which was greater than 2 cm and she subsequently went
for a right modified mastectomy and axillary dissection. She had
negative margins and 1 positive lymph node. The tumor was ER
positive and she was subsequently stage 2, N1 disease.
Subseqeuently received adjuvant CMF chemotherapy, followed by 5
years tamoxifen. Had long disease free interval, with subsequent
recurrent disease w/ bony involvement in [**2120**]. Started on femara
at that point with good response. On progression from this she
was placed on aromasin in [**6-15**] but did not do well with this,
with increased bone pain. Most recently placed back on tamoxifen
since [**1-17**].

Social History:
Lives at home in [**Location (un) 86**] w/ husband, functional of ADLs. Former
smoker for
approximately 50 pack years, quit 10 years ago.  Rare social
alcohol.

Family History:
sister died of breast ca, 56

Pertinent Results:
CXR [**2125-4-29**]: PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  There is an
opacity within the left lung base with associated volume loss
consistent with atelectasis/consolidation. Small left pleural
effusion is present.  The cardiomediastinal contour is stable.
The pulmonary vessels demonstrate mild cephalization, however
there is no frank edema. Mild loss of height is seen in
mid-thoracic spine vertebral body as well as mottled appearance
and fractures involving multiple ribs.
.
TTE [**2125-4-30**]: The left atrium is elongated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion
abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Transmitral Doppler and
tissue velocity imaging are consistent with Grade II (moderate)
LV diastolic dysfunction. Right ventricular chamber size and
free wall motion are normal. The aortic root is moderately
dilated athe sinus level. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic arch is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. The aortic valve is not well seen. There is no
aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. The mitral valve is not well
seen. Mild to
moderate ([**12-12**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to suboptimal
image
quality, the severity of mitral regurgitation may be
significantly
UNDERestimated.] There is no pericardial effusion.
.
RIB FILMS [**2125-4-30**]: Multiple healed bilateral rib fractures and
osseous metastatic disease involving the ribs.  Possible acute
fracture of lateral left sixth rib.
.
CT T-SPINE [**2125-5-2**]: CT scan of the thoracic spine which was
obtained on [**2124-5-26**], and employed contrast administration
intravenously.  The study was reported by myself and Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 5325**] as revealing "diffusely abnormal appearing vertebral
bodies in the thoracic spine as seen on the prior MRI scan
consistent with metastatic disease.  A focal lytic lesion in T5
vertebral body has progressed since [**2120**].  Anterior wedging of
T12 with an associated central lucency extending to the superior
endplate suggests pathological fracture. Heterogeneously
enlarged thyroid gland.  Correlate son[**Name (NI) 5326**]."  Comparison
with the prior study of [**2124-5-26**] reveals likely progression
of diffuse metastatic disease of the thoracic spine.  While the
present study appears to be of higher spatial resolution than
the prior examination, there has been some progression of
compression fractures, including nearly all thoracic vertebral
bodies, most notably at T7, T8 and T12.  However, there does not
appear to be retropulsion of pathologic fractures into the
central spinal canal.  The T5 lytic lesion is not as clearly
discernible at this time, suggesting there may have been some
interval reactive sclerosis.  There are probable small bilateral
pleural effusions, slightly more evident on the left side, as
well as multiple small wedge-shaped areas of soft tissue density
within the posterior lung fields.  These pulmonary lesions were
not present on the prior spinal CT scan but were seen, at least
in part, on a recent torso CT scan.  It is suggested that these
pulmonary issues be reviewed
with the chest CT service, and if deemed necessary, a followup
chest CT scan be obtained. Finally, there is no overt sign or an
epidural mass on this study, although in this regard, MR
scanning is more efficacious at detecting such an abnormality.
CONCLUSION:  Apparent progression of what is likely diffuse
osseous metastatic disease, with the appearance of multiple
compression fractures as noted above.

[**5-14**] TTE
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular
cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is normal
(LVEF>55%). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left
ventricular
filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Transmitral Doppler and tissue
velocity
imaging are consistent with Grade III/IV (severe) LV diastolic
dysfunction.
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
The ascending
aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There
is no aortic valve stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests a restrictive
filling
abnormality, with elevated left atrial pressure. The tricuspid
valve leaflets
are mildly thickened. Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid
regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There
is an anterior
space which most likely represents a fat pad.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2125-4-30**],
the mitral
deceleration time is now shorter suggestive of more severe
diastolic
dysfunction/elevated left atrial pressures. Significant
tricuspid
regurgitation is now detected (suboptimal visualized in prior
study).
Significant pulmonary artery systolic hypertension in now
detected (unable to
assess in prior study).
