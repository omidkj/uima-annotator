HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This 75-year-old gentleman with
a history of an aortic valve replacement in [**2181**] developed
culture-negative endocarditis in [**2183**] requiring a redo aortic
valve replacement with homograft.  The patient was admitted
to an outside hospital earlier this year with a two-week
history of fatigue and shortness of breath.  Echocardiogram
showed preserved left ventricular function, new 3+ aortic
insufficiency, new 3+ mitral regurgitation, old 4+ tricuspid
regurgitation, and elevated pulmonary artery systolic
pressures.  The aortic regurgitation was thought to be due to
a probable vegetation on the aortic prosthesis as well as
probable vegetation on the mitral valve.  At that time
infectious disease was consulted as the patient had negative
blood cultures.  Infectious disease started a work-up for
indolent infection that could cause culture-negative
endocarditis.  Decision was made at that time not to place
the patient on any antibiotics and multiple serologies and
cultures were sent.  The patient was referred to Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] for a redo-redo aortic valve replacement.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1. Aortic stenosis status post aortic
valve replacement in [**2181**] with culture-negative endocarditis
in [**2183**] status post redo aortic valve replacement.  2. Status
post repair of abdominal aortic aneurysm in 11/[**2183**].  3.
Postural hypotension.  4. Chronic respiratory insufficiency
with a baseline creatinine of 1.8 to 2.2.  5. B12 deficiency.
6. Depression.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  1. Hydralazine 50 mg p.o. t.i.d.
2. Lopressor 12.5 mg p.o. b.i.d.  3. Isosorbide 20 mg p.o.
t.i.d.  4. Lasix 20 mg p.o. q. day.

HO[**Last Name (STitle) **] COURSE:  The patient was taken to the operating room
on [**2185-4-18**] with Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] for a redo aortic
valve replacement with a 27 mm [**Last Name (un) 3843**]-[**Doctor Last Name **] valve, a
resection of the supracoronary homograft and replacement with
a tube graft, a mitral valve repair with a 28 mm
[**Last Name (un) 3843**]-[**Doctor Last Name **] ring, a tricuspid valve repair with a 32
mm [**Last Name (un) 3843**]-[**Doctor Last Name **] ring.  Specimens were transported from
the operating room by the infectious disease team for
culture.  At the time of the operation the patient also had a
permanent pacer in place.  The distal portions of the leads
were cut and removed and the generator and proximal portion
of the leads were left in place to be removed at a later
time.  The patient was transported to the intensive care unit
in stable condition.

On postoperative day one the patient's epicardial pacing
wires failed to capture.  The patient was in complete heart
block with a ventricular rhythm in the 50s, hemodynamically
stable with this rhythm.  The electrophysiology team was
consulted and it was decided that as long as the patient
remained stable in that rhythm, the team would wait to put in
a new permanent pacemaker at a later time.

Postoperatively the patient was started on ceftriaxone and
levofloxacin by the infectious disease team for empiric
coverage of unusual organisms.

On postoperative day number two the patient remained
intubated and had several episodes of congestive heart
failure which responded to Lasix from probable fluid overload
postoperatively.  The patient remained in complete heart
block, however stable with this rhythm.  The patient also
developed thrombocytopenia.  On postoperative day number two
the platelet count was found to be 54.  All heparin in
flushes was discontinued and heparin-induced platelet
antibody was sent which was subsequently negative.  The
patient was also noted to have a rising creatinine.  In light
of his chronic renal insufficiency it was decided to obtain a
renal consultation.

On the evening of postoperative day number two the patient
developed a fever of 101.3 and was pancultured.  The patient
continued to have a rising creatinine on postoperative day
number three.  The nephrology service felt it was due to
hypoperfusion as the patient's blood pressure had been kept
low due to the nature of the surgery.

On postoperative day number three the patient was weaned and
extubated from mechanical ventilation without difficulty.
The patient's antibiotics were changed from ceftriaxone to
Zosyn to cover empirically an assumed ventilator-acquired
pneumonia for nosocomial Gram-negative rods.  Subsequent
sputum cultures were negative for significant pathogenic
bacteria.  Over the next couple of days the patient's
creatinine improved.  Creatinine peaked at 2.5 on
postoperative day number three, decreased to baseline of
around 2 where it remained for the rest of the [**Hospital 228**]
hospital stay.

The patient was taken to the electrophysiology laboratory on
[**2185-4-25**] for extraction of old pacemaker generator and
remaining leads and implantation of new dual chamber
pacemaker.  The patient tolerated the procedure without
complications.

On postoperative day number eight the patient had a PICC line
placed for long-term antibiotic therapy.  The patient's
epicardial pacing wires, chest tubes and Foley catheter were
removed.

On postoperative day number eight the electrophysiology
fellow interrogated the pacemaker.  The patient was found to
be in atrial tachycardia versus atrial flutter.  At that time
decision was made to start anticoagulation.  The patient was
started on Coumadin to anticoagulate for atrial flutter with
the decision that the patient would follow up with the
electrophysiology team, in one month have a transesophageal
echocardiogram to rule out clot, and attempts would be made
to rapid atrially pace the patient to restore sinus rhythm.

On postoperative day number nine the infectious disease team
decided as all cultures to date had been negative, the Zosyn
would be discontinued and the patient would be changed back
to ceftriaxone and levofloxacin, and requested that the
patient remain on antibiotics for a total of one month.  The
patient was transferred out of the intensive care unit to the
floor on postoperative day number nine.

On postoperative day number 11 the patient was cleared for
discharge to rehabilitation.  Physical examination on
discharge showed that the patient was awake and alert,
oriented x 3, pulse 60, V-paced respiratory rate of 15, room
air oxygen saturation 97%.  Heart was regular rate and rhythm
without rub or murmur.  Lungs were clear anteriorly with
scattered rhonchi at bilateral bases.  Incision was clean,
dry and intact with staples along the sternal incision.  The
patient had a pacemaker generator in his right chest with a
dressing over it which was to remain intact until the patient
follows up with the electrophysiology clinic.  The patient
had a left PICC line. The site was clean, dry and intact
without erythema.

Laboratory data showed a white blood cell count of 7.3,
hematocrit 28.4, platelet count 142, PT 15.5, INR 1.6, PTT
31.5, sodium 138, potassium 4.1, chloride 104, bicarbonate
21, BUN 24, creatinine 2.1, glucose 134.  All cultures from
the operating room are negative to date.
