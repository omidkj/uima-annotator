History of Present Illness:
49M h/o stage IV esophageal cancer (treated at [**Company 2860**]), DVT found
by wife unresponsive earlier today taken to [**Location (un) 1468**] OSH where
initially rec'd narcan for possible narcotic OD but no
improvement, ?witnessed seizure (shaking of extremities) for
which he was intubated and loaded with dilantin, also
tachycardic and hypertensive
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] ED for further care. Per the wife, the
patient was feeling fatigued and having some "congestion" prior
to this presentation but was otherwise in his USOH this AM
before she left for work. She then tried to call him but did not
get a response so she went home and found him in a chair with
his head back unresponsive. EMS was called and he was taken to
OSH as above. She says that her husband was not having any
fevers or chills, no dyuria, change in bowel habits, no
shortness of breath but +chest pains over the last several days
with upper airway congestion. She says that he never had any
seizure activity at home. His other past medical history is
signficant for a h/o West [**Doctor First Name **] infection c/b VRE, ?MRSA
infections at [**Hospital1 112**] last year.
.
Here the patient is no responsive, not following commands, not
responding to sternal rub, pupils sluggish but reaction. Per
neuro eval in the ED, patient has intact brain stem reflexes
(incl reactive pupils, corneals, dolls, grimace to nasal tickle,

swallow), withdraws arms symmetrically to noxious stim and
symmetric DTRs. [**Name (NI) 72787**] from OSH negative for bleed or obvious
mass. Upon arrival here, patient given 2L NS, levo/vanco/flagyl
for bandemia. CT torso showing preliminarily no PE, ?aspiration
pnemonia and pericolic fluid.

Blood/Urine Cultures from [**6-22**]: Pending, NGTD

CT Chest/Abd/Pelvis [**6-21**]
IMPRESSION:
1. Extremely limited study secondary to patient motion and lack
of intravenous contrast.
2. Abnormally dilated loops of small bowel, some demonstrating
wall thickening. Findings could represent proximal obstruction.
3. Left lower lobe consolidation concerning for pneumonia.
4. Multiple pulmonary nodules and small cystic lesions seen
within the lungs, concerning for metastatic disease. Short
interval followup within three months is recommended given
patient's history of malignancy.
5. Nodular peritoneal implants with diffuse mesenteric stranding
concerning for metastatic disease.
Comparison with prior outside images is recommended to evaluate
for change.
CT Head [**6-21**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. No acute intracranial hemorrhage.
2. Small area of low attenuation in the right frontal lobe,
without significant mass effect or loss of [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white
differentiation. Consider MRI for further assessment.
CXR [**6-21**]: IMPRESSION: ET tube in satisfactory position, with
very low lung volumes.


Brief Hospital Course:
50 M with advanced esophageal CA found unresponsive, with
question of observed activity.
.
Patient was briefly admitted to the ICU for management prior to
transfer to [**Hospital1 4601**] Oncology where patient receives majority
of his care.
.
On Admission:
.
# Altered MS. [**Name13 (STitle) **] found unresponsive. Differential is broad,
toxic metabolic, ?narcotics related although minimal/no response
to narcan. ?seizure although no clear brain metastases. Patient
now intubated and sedated for airway protection. ?atypical or
viral source.  Mental status on admission showed intact brain
stem reflexes w/ reactive pupils, corneal blink, and no acute
change in underlying mental status was observed during his ICU
stay.  On admission to ICU, patient was initially covered with
vancomycin and zosyn, but given concern for CNS infection was
broadened to vancomycin, ceftriaxone, acyclovir, ampicillin and
flagyl at appropriate doses.  Plan was for urgent LP/MRI/EEG but
work-up was interrupted by request of family and primary
oncologist to have transfer to [**Hospital3 328**] for further care.
EEG was performed and demonstrated no focal seizure activity
with moderate global encephalopathy c/w toxic/metabolic process.
 Plan at the time of discharge is for:
- LP (plts marginal, will need plts pre LP), would send
infectious/viral studies in addition to routine labwork.
- MRI/MRA/MRV w/&w/o contrast brain when able.
- continue dilantin for now, 100mg IV TID, check albumin and
dilantin trough in am goa
