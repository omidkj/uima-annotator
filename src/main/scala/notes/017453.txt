Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2071**]
Chief Complaint:
SOB

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Transesophageal echocardiogram

History of Present Illness:
This is a 51 yo with a history of type II DM, morbid obesity,
HTN, COPD who presents with CC of SOB.  He was in his USOH until
2 weeks ago.  He began to note intermittent left sided chest
pain in setting of lifting heavy objects while building a deck
in his new house.  He initially thought that his SOB was
secondary to inhalation of cement fumes and did not think much
of his worsening dyspnea on exertion.  He also noted left sided
arm, wrist and leg pain around this same time frame.  Today his
breathing continued to get worse and thus saw his PCP who sent
him to the ER due to concerns for on-going cardiac ischemia.  He
denies recent travel, surgery, or immobilization.

EDVS Temp:97.2 HR:139 BP:171/114 Resp:26 O(2)Sat:98.  He
received albuterol, atrovent nebs, and solumedrol.  His
tachycardia was felt to be sinus tach vs SVT and was started on
a dilt gtt.  He also had a CTA that was suboptimal and was
started on a heparin gtt.

Review of systems is negative for fevers, chills, cough, changes
in sputum production, nausea, vomitting, and diarrhea.

CT chest:
IMPRESSION:
1. Limited study due to contrast bolus timing. No definite
evidence of large central pulmonary embolism. The lobar,
segmental, and subsegmental branches cannot be evaluated due to
contrast timing and patient's body habitus.
2. Some prominent mediastinal lymph nodes measuring up to 1 cm
(slightly enlarged since [**2128**]). Clinical correlation is
recommended. Differential diagnosis includes
inflammatory/infectious and less likely neoplastic etiologies
due to presence since [**2128**] without large increase in size or
number.
3. 6-mm nodule in the right upper lobe (3:26) is stable 12/[**2128**].
To establish 2 year stability a chest CT in [**11/2131**] (in 8 to 12
months) is recommended.

Echo ([**4-12**]): The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
There is severe global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF =
20%). The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2129-7-26**],
the left ventricular function is worse.

Bilateral LENIs ([**4-12**]): IMPRESSION: No evidence of DVT in the
lower extremities bilaterally.

TEE ([**4-14**]): no intraatrial thrombus

Pmibi ([**4-17**]):
Atypical type symptoms in the absence of ischemic EKG changes or
ectopy.
1. Probably normal myocardial perfusion. Fixed apical defect
most likely due to attenuation.
2. Increased left ventricular cavity size. Severe global
hypokinesis.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 56605**] is a 51 yo with history of COPD, HTN, morbid obesity
presenting with acute hypoxia and tachycardia. He was found to
be fluid overloaded and in aflutter. He underwent successful
cardioversion and was started on Coumadin, discharged with a
therapeutic INR.

# Hypoxia: Acuity of symptoms and concomittant tachycardia was
concerning for acute PE.  On arrival to ICU, pt was
hemodynamically stable on empiric treatment with heparin gtt
secondary to non-diagnostic CTA.  Differential also included
COPD exacerbation though PFTs does not demonstrate large
obstructive component and pt's lungs were clear on admission.
Clinically pt was moving air fairly well and he was weaned to RA
on [**2131-4-12**] (the day after admission). Steroids given in ED were
not continued in ICU however nebs were given standing and
tapered to PRN on the day after admission. Volume overload was
considered, while it is difficult to clinically assess volume
status due to body habitus, BNP not tremendously elevated at 496
on admission.  Cardiac enzymes were cycled and were negative.
LENIs were negative for DVT. Pt was aggressively diuresed with
IV lasix but this did not help the pt's symptoms. Pt did have a
TTE on [**2131-4-12**] to assess for LV/ RV function and WMA which
showed global LV dysfunction without a good measurement of the
RV. LVEF was 20% down from 55% in [**2128**].  The pt was called out
to the cardiology service on [**2131-4-14**]. He remained on RA for the
rest of hospitalization, satting high 90s with no further
requirement for oxygen.

# Atrial flutter: The patient presented with a rhythm of SVT,
most likely multifocal atrial tachycardia. The patient was
started on a dilt gtt in the ER which was not controlling his
rate well. He was switched to metoprolol to help better control
his rate. His rhythm converted to atrial flutter. He underwent a
TEE to r/o an atrial clot and was successfully D/C cardioverted
on [**2131-4-14**]. He was continued on a heparin gtt. Cardiology
suggested that he continue a beta blocker. He was also started
on Amiodarone with a slow taper. He was discharged on Amio 400mg
[**Hospital1 **] x 2 weeks (until [**5-2**]), 400mg daily x 1 month (until [**6-3**]),
then 200mg daily ongoing. He should be evaluated in the future
for possible ablation procedure. He was maintained on Heparin
gtt for a week until INR was therapeutic. He was not able to use
Lovenox [**1-16**] to his weight (only studied in patients up to
150kg).

# HTN: Hypertensive in setting of respiratory distress on
admission so Diovan at home dose was continued. BP was well
controlled on Diovan and Metoprolol for the rest of the
hospitalization.

# Chronic venous stasis changes/cellulitis: Without evidence for
acute infection this admission for home suppressive dose of
augmentin was continued.

# OSA: Team attempted to work with pt to use CPAP overnight with
limited success in the hospital. Patient was witnessed to
desaturate while sleeping at night in the CC
