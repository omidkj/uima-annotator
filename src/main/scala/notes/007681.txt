Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2074**]
Chief Complaint:
syncope, ventricular fibrillation arrest

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Pacemaker/ICD implantation


History of Present Illness:
78 M with h/o CAD s/p several PTCA reportedly single vessel
balloon angioplasty with no stents, HTN, hypercholesterolemia,
h/o V Fib arrest in [**2101**], DM who presented to OSH after
witnessed episode of syncope lasting 10 minutes.  EMS called by
wife.  The EMS found patient with bradycardia 30-40s. At the
outside hospital ED, the patient was felt to be 2:1 AV block.
He was reportedly stable in the outside ED. He was admitted to
the outside hospital CCU for close monitoring given the AV
block. In the CCU, the patient suddenly had polymorphic VT felt
to be torsades which degenerated into coarse VF, and then fine
VF. He given IV magnesium and atropine, and CPR was
administered.  The entire episode lasted 2 minutes and he
spontaneosly converted back to bradycardic sinus rhythm.
Emergent transvenous pacer wire placed by the staff
cardiologist. He was then noted to have monomorphic VT,
therefore Lidocaine and lopressor were administered. He
underwent cardiac catheterizationon [**2114-4-2**], the day of transfer
which noted totally occluded RCA, and disease in both LAD and
Left Circumflex. Of note, the patient never experienced chest
pain or shortness of breath.

Brief Hospital Course:
78 M s/p Ventricular fibrillation arrest 12+ years ago, with h/o
CAD s/p single angioplasty, DM who presents with syncope found
to have 2:1 AV block transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] after V tach/ V Fib
arrest at [**Hospital3 45967**] for possible CABG. Pt transferred
after initial stabilization with temporary pacer wire insertion
and lidociane drip started.  Patient underwent cardiac
catheterization at [**Hospital3 45967**] prior to transfer which
showed totally occluded Right coronary artery with good
collateral flow and significant, but not obstructive disease in
both the LAD and the Left Circumflex.  Based on the
catheterization findings, the patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]
for possible CABG and pacemaker implantation.

1. Cardiac:
Coronary Artery Disease:  It was initially felt that the
patient's 3 vessel coronary artery disease might be the etiology
of his V tach/ V fib arrest. Therefore the patient was
transferred for urgent revascularization.  However, after his
cardiac enzymes were cycled and he ruled out for myocardial
ischemia (with the highest troponin being 0.04), his
cardiovascular disease was felt to be non-acute.  The cardiac
catheterization films were reviewed with the interventionalists
and the cardiovascular surgeons(Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] who initially
decided that even though, he was not having active myocardial
ishcemia, a CABG would be reasonable, especially given the
patient needed a pacemaker and performing the CABG would be
simpler prior to lead implantation by electrophysiology.
However, the patient's mental status waxed and waned while he
was awaiting cardiac CABG.  Re-evaluation of the patient's
mental status included a head CT which was negative and a
neurology consult.  After much discussion with neurology and CT
surgery, a decision was made not to perform CABG during this
admission. The basis for this decision was threefold: 1) the
patient would be at significant risk of a worsened mental status
post cardiac bypass surgery, 2) cardiac enzymes and EKGs
supported there was no acute myocardial ischemia, but rather
chronic coronary artery disease, and 3) the urgent issue was
pacemaker and AICD implantation given his heart block.  It was
felt it would be prudent to implant the pacemaker and AICD and
arrange cardiology and CT surgery follow up for possible future
elective CABG depending on patient's mental status and symptoms
of cardioascular disease. In the meantime, maximal medical
management of his cardiovascular disease would be the goal.  The
patient was continued on ASA, B-Blocker, Statin, and started on
an ACE-I during the admission.  Dual chamber PM/ICD was placed
[**4-6**].  He is now A sensed, V paced.  He will follow up in device
clinic in 7 days and complete 7 days antibiotics.

Of note, during the CABG work-up, he had left carotid ultrasound
which was reportedly negative.  His pre-op CXR during this
admission was clear.

RHYTHM:  At the outside hospital, the patient was noted to be in
2:1 AV block.  A temporary pacer wire was placed as transition
to permanent pacemaker.  EP consulted and placed PM/ICD on
[**2114-4-6**].
His lidocaine was discontinued on arrival to prevent CNS
toxicity.

PUMP: No evidence of CHF on exam during this admission. By
report past EF was 35%.
Inpatient Echo showed:
Left atrium mildly dilated, mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with normal cavity size and moderate global
hypokinesis and septal dysnchrony. In addition, right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.  The
aortic root and ascending aorta are mildly dilated. The aortic
valve leaflets appeared structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion and no aortic regurgitation. No aortic regurgitation
is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild to
moderate ([**11-19**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is mild
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no  pericardial
effusion.

DM: Patient was monitored with fasting sugars QID and
administered Humalog SS while awaiting CABG. He was transitioned
to po meds on discharge.

GLAUCOMA: Patient was continued on his multiple eye drops for
his history of closed angle glaucoma.

h/o DVT: Per pt DVT was in setting of trauma and [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 260**]
filter was placed for this. Further history was not able to be
obtained.

MENTAL STATUS: Treated with ativan and zyprexa. He responded the
best to zyprexa. Haldol was avoided to prevent QTc prolongation.

h/o BRBPR at outside hospital, guaiac negative by report: Pt
states that he has history of hemarrhoids. He described noticing
blood on toilet tissue and small amount in bowel. He denied
worrisome signs to suggest GI malignancy. His hct was stable and
guaiac negative at OSH.

FEN: cardiac diet recommnended.

PROPHYLAXIS: PPI, Heparin SQ TID, and bowel regimen was
administered during the hospital stay
