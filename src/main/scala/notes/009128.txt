ADMISSION DIAGNOSIS:  Sepsis and hypotension.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Patient is a 56-year-old male
with a history of metastatic esophageal cancer with
metastatic disease to the lung complicated by esophageal
fistula, esophagectomy, deep vein thrombosis, and recent
Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia.
Patient initially presented to [**Hospital6 2910**]
earlier on the day of admission with complaints of increasing
weakness, decreased po intake, mild abdominal pain and
dehydration plus some shortness of breath over the past week.
He also reported a cough productive of whitish-yellow sputum,
and decreased frequency of urination.  He denied any fevers,
chills, headache, chest pain, nausea or vomiting, diarrhea or
dysuria.  He reports that he is only able to take one can of
feeding through his J tube each day.

At the outside hospital, his white blood cell count was 20.
His chest x-ray showed findings consistent with congestive
heart failure or right upper lobe pneumonia.  Vital signs on
presentation at [**Hospital6 **] were a heart rate of 112,
blood pressure 60/palp, respiratory rate of 16 and an oxygen
saturation of 95% on room air.  He was given two liters of
saline intravenously and his pressure came up to 105/57.  He
was treated with 60 mg of intravenous Solu-Medrol as well as
500 mg of Levaquin intravenously.  He was then transferred to
[**Hospital6 256**] for further evaluation.

On presentation in the Emergency Department, his temperature
was 96.9.  Heart rate 110. Blood pressure 105/70.
Respiratory rate between 18-20.  In the Emergency Room, he
was evaluated and intravenous fluid boluses were given for
his hypotension. It was noted that he had worsening
respiratory distress and his oxygen saturations diminished to
the 60% range on 100% nonrebreather.  He was then electively
intubated for increasing respiratory distress.  Blood
cultures were sent.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Esophageal cancer treated with surgery
and x-ray therapy; he had right lower extremity deep vein
thrombosis; two prior strokes with residual right lower
extremity weakness; abdominal aortic aneurysm; esophageal
fistula; Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus
infection; motor vehicle accident [**2131-1-13**] fracture; J
tube insertion after sepsis episode; chronic lower back pain
and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

ALLERGIES:  None.

MEDICATIONS:
1.  Bactrim Double Strength 1 tablet po q.d.
2.  Percocet.
3.  Reglan 10 mg twice a day.
4.  Combivent inhaler b.i.d.
5.  Ritalin b.i.d.
6.  >....<MDI b.i.d.
7.  Remeron 30 mg once a day.
8.  Celexa 40 mg q.h.s.
9.  Dilomine 30 mg once a day.
10. Darvocet prn.
11. Vistaril 25 mg q. 6 hours prn.
12. Decadron 2 mg b.i.d.
13. Lovenox 100 mg subcutaneous q.d.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  He had a 60 pack year history of smoking and
lives with his wife.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient underwent an abdominal CT scan
which showed no evidence of intraabdominal abscess, focus of
infection, or a perforation.  The CT scan did show a moderate
sized pericardial effusion.  The patient was admitted to the
Medical Intensive Care Unit and upon arrival, patient was
noted minutes later to become hypotensive with a mean blood
pressure of 40 and was then noted to have a cardiac arrest
with pulseless electrical activity.  CPR was immediately
initiated, and 1 mg of epinephrine was given.  The Doppler
probe was then used to ascertain that a pulse was present and
the patient was started on intravenous pressor [**Doctor Last Name 360**].
Neo-Synephrine drip was started and this brought the blood
pressure back up into an acceptable range.  At this point,
the Cardiology Fellow was notified who performed a bedside
ultrasound which confirmed the presence of a significant
pericardial effusion causing tamponade physiology.  The
family was immediately apprised of the situation, and was
presented with the options of pursuing a decompression of the
pericardial effusion or pursuing a course of conservative
management, given the grim prognosis of the patient's
esophageal cancer.  The patient's oncologist was also
[**Name (NI) 653**], who had seen the patient earlier in the day.  He
felt that the patient's family was aware of all the facts
concerning the prognosis and was capable of making a wise
decision about the patient's further care. Upon further
discussion with the family, it was decided to withdrawal care
and provide supportive care only.  Because of this,
decompression of the pericardial effusion was not pursued,
and pressure support was withdrawn.  Approximately five
minutes after withdrawing suppressor support, the patient
went into full cardiac and then respiratory arrest and was
pronounced dead at approximately 11:10 a.m.  The family was
notified and the medical examiner was [**Name (NI) 653**] who declined
to pursue an autopsy in the case.
