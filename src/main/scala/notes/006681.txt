Pertinent Results:
[**6-22**] CXR: Pending

[**6-7**] Cath: 1. Coronary angiography in this right-dominant system
demonstrated three-vessel and left main disease. The LMCA had an
ostial 80% stenosis. The LAD was heavily calcified and had a 80%
proximal stenosis. The LCx had moderate diffuse disease with an
80% stenosis in its first obtuse marginal branch. The RCA was
totally occluded and filled via collaterals. 2. Resting
hemodynamics revealed elevated right- and left-sided filling
pressures, with an RVEDP of 13 mm Hg and a PCWP of 20 mm Hg.
There was moderate pulmonary arterial systolic hypertension,
with a PASP of 49 mm Hg. The cardiac index was preserved at 2.7
L/min/m2. The systemic arterial blood pressure was normal. There
was no gradient upon pullback of the catheter from the left
ventricle to the aorta.

[**6-8**] Carotid U/S: There is less than 40% stenosis within the
internal carotid arteries bilaterally.

[**6-8**] Chest CT: 1. Complete left upper lobe atelectasis with
central obstructing lesion that potentially may represent
obstructing tumor versus plaque and should be correlated with
bronchoscopy. 2. Multiple mediastinal lymph nodes, but none of
them specifically enlarged. 3. Right upper lobe and to a lesser
extent right middle lobe opacity that most likely represent area
of infection or aspiration and less likely asymmetric edema. 4.
Bilateral moderate pleural effusion. 5. Extensive involvement of
thoracic spine by multiple wedge compression fractures. Old
fracture of the right humerus. Multiple rib fractures.

[**6-17**] Echo: PREBYPASS: The interatrial septum is aneurysmal. No
atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left
ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular
cavity size is normal. There is mild regional left ventricular
systolic dysfunction with mild inferior hypokinesis. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF=
45-50 %). The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with
borderline normal free wall function. The ascending aorta is
mildly dilated. The descending thoracic aorta is mildly dilated.
There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending thoracic
aorta. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. No
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
POSTBYPASS: LV systolic function remains unchanged. MR remains
mild. Study otherwise unchanged from prebypass.

[**6-20**] CXR: Moderate-to-large left pleural effusion has increased
since [**2196-6-18**]. Generalized mediastinal widening, which
developed between 7:30 a.m. and 10:45 a.m. on [**2196-6-18**] has
changed in distribution but not in overall severity, concerning
for mediastinal blood or other focal fluid accumulation. No
pneumothorax. Mild pulmonary edema and small right pleural
effusion have increased. Findings were discussed with the
clinical care team member responsible for this patient, at the
time of dictation.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 22627**] is a 76 year old gentleman status post total hip
arthroplasty ([**2196-6-2**]) at [**Hospital6 **] who presents with
Atrial fibrillation (HR 90-100)and post-op NSTEMI. He was found
to have 3 vessel coronary disease demonstrated by
catheterization ([**2196-6-7**]) and is on day [**4-14**] of empiric treatment
for hospital acquired pneumonitis. Cardiac surgery was consulted
and he was worked-up in the usual manner for coronary artery
bypass grafting. He was noted to have left forearm phlebitis. An
ultrasound revealed no evidence of deep vein thrombosis.
Pulmonary function testing was obtained which showed an FEV1 of
1.57L. A carotid duplex ultrasound was also obtained which
showed less than 40% stenosis within the internal carotid
arteries bilaterally. Chest CT revealed new infiltrates and he
developed a fever. Cefepime and vancomycin were started and
surgery was delayed. In addition there was
