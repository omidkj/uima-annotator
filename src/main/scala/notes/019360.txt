Studies:
.
[**2133-8-29**] CXR
1. Moderate pulmonary edema.
2. Left ventricular and pulmonary artery prominence.
3. Small bilateral pleural effusions.
4. Right-sided pacemaker adjacent to the right atrium and right
ventricle.
.
[**2133-8-30**] Femoral Ultrasound
1. Findings consistent with right groin CFA->CFV AV fistula. 2.
Small hypoechoic area in the right groin measuring 3.7 x 2.6 cm,
likely representing a hematoma.
.
[**2133-9-7**] ECHO
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion
abnormality cannot be  fully excluded. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%). The right
ventricular free wall is hypertrophied. Right ventricular
chamber size is normal. Right ventricular systolic function is
borderline  normal. The prosthesis cannot be adequately
assessed. There is no pericardial effusion.
.
[**2133-9-9**] Chest CT
1. Focal airspace consolidation at the lung bases bilaterally
consistent with pneumonia.
2. Nodular air-space opacities in a bronchovascular
distribution, predominantly affecting the upper lobes. There are
prominent mediastinal and symmetric hilar lymph nodes. These
findings raises the possibility of sarcoidosis although it would
be atypical in a 70-year-old male. Less likely causes include
lymphoma and metastasis/lymphatic spread of tumor.
3. Status post median sternotomy and mitral valve replacement.
Bilateral chest tubes without evidence of pneumothorax.
.
[**2133-9-10**] ECHO
The left atrium is dilated. No spontaneous echo contrast is seen
in the body of the left atrium. No atrial septal defect or
patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline
contrast with maneuvers. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is borderline depressed (ejection fraction ?50%). Right
ventricular systolic function is borderline normal in suboptimal
views. There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the aortic arch.
There are focal calcifications in the aortic arch. There are
simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. The aortic
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. No aortic regurgitation is
seen. A bioprosthetic mitral valve prosthesis is present and
appears well-seated. The motion of the mitral valve prosthetic
leaflets appears normal. Trivial valvular and paravalvular
mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is no pericardial effusion.
.
[**2133-9-26**] Abdominal Ultrasound
Unremarkable appearance of the gallbladder, bile ducts, and
pancreatic head.
.
[**2133-9-28**] CT Scan
There are bilateral pleural effusions, large layering on the
right and moderate on the left with fascial extension.
Atelectases both lower lobes are seen. The right and left main
bronchi and the segmental bronchi are compressed however appear
patent.  Enlarging 16-mm paratracheal, enlarged 13-mm right
retrocrural, and stable subcentimeter diaphragmatic and
prevascular nodes are seen. Extensive atherosclerotic, aortic,
and coronary artery calcifications are seen along with mitral
annulus calcification. A pericardial catheter is seen in place.
There is no pericardial effusion.  In the imaged upper abdomen
the unenhanced liver appears hyperdense with an attenuation
value of 60. The gallbladder is distended without wall
thickening. Spleen, adrenals, and imaged kidneys are
unremarkable. Minimal amount of ascites is seen.  Degenerative
changes are present in the bones. Median sternotomy with normal
alignment of the sternal suture.
.
Abd CT [**10-8**]: 1. Large left psoas hematoma as described above.
2. Moderate amount of free air. No definite cause is identified.
This could be secondary to manipulation of the G-tube. Clinical
correlation with the history of procedures is recommended. 3.
Moderate amount of free fluid in the abdomen and pelvis. 4.
Moderate bilateral pleural effusions with associated
atelectasis. 5. Multiple retroperitoneal and pelvic lymph nodes.
They are larger than what
is normally seen. Although they are unchanged when compared to
the recent study, followup is recommended in three months to
assess for stability.
