History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 41 yo male with h/o poorly controlled asthma and no
history of liver disease transferred from OSH with hematemesis.
Patient reports heavy alcohol use since this [**Month (only) 359**], up to and
more than a 12 pack per day.  Prior to that, he had been sober
for four years.  Patient does endorse alcohol prior to period of
abstinence.  Started drinking heavily again in [**Month (only) 359**] because
of difficulties at home; he did not expand.

Patient last had five beers this morning.  Reports onset of
massive hematemesis soon thereafter.  Denies any other
associated symptoms.  No abdominal pain, no chest pain/pressure,
no lightheadedness/syncope.  No fevers or chills at home.  ROS
otherwise unremarkable.  Patient sought care at OSH.

Upon arrival to OSH, initial vitals were T 97, HR 126  108/74
RR 28 noted to have about 300 cc bright red blood and then 900
cc bright red blood just before take off with med flight.
Recieved 2 liters NS, one unit prbc's was up and running prior
to transfer.  Treated with 50mcg bolus and 50mcg/hr drip
octreotide, protonix 40mg bolus and 8mg/hr drip 3 18's in place.
 BP transiently dropped to 70s back up to 110-150/sys prior to
transfer.  Hct at OSH was 40.

In the ED, initial vitals were HR 130, BP 131/71, RR 22, 96% RA.
 Surgery was consulted and suggested EGD to qualify bleeding.
GI saw patient in ED, with plans for urgent EGD in ICU (see
below).  Patient received octreotide gtt, protonix gtt,
ceftriaxone 1 gram IV x 1, Valium 5 mg IV x 1, and zofran.
Received 2 liters of NS, and unit of PRBCs from OSH finished
prior to transfer on floor.  NG lavage continued to return
bright red blood prior to transfer.

Vitals on transfer:  Admission Vitals: 97.9 109 113/73 16 99%RA

Upon arrival to the ICU, patient reported feeling nauseated,
with occasional episodes of wretching. NGT was in place and was

RUQ US:
1. Echogenic liver, most compatible with fatty infiltration,
although more
advanced disease such as cirrhosis or fibrosis cannot be
excluded with this technique. There is no focal intrahepatic
lesion or intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation.
2. Patent portal veins, hepatic veins, and hepatic arteries,
demonstrating
appropriate flow directions and waveforms.
3. Normal gallbladder.
4. The pancreas was obscured by overlying bowel gas and was not
evaluated.

CHEST, AP: Nasogastric tube courses into the stomach and
inferiorly, with tip just beyond the edge of the film. There are
no significant pleural effusions or pneumothorax. The lungs are
clear. The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are normal.

IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary process.


Brief Hospital Course:
41 yo M with poorly controlled asthma, alcohol abuse, presented
on [**2199-11-30**] with hematemesis.

# UGIB: Patient presented with hematemesis; Hct was 38 on
admission and fell to 24.  EGD on admission showed an adherent
clot at GE junction that appeared to be visible vessel (possible
[**Doctor First Name 329**]-[**Doctor Last Name **] tear); this was injected and clipped.  Patient was
hemodynamically unstable prior to EGD, with tachycardia and
lactic acidosis, with low blood pressure secondary to sedation
(required 4 liters during EGD to maintain BP).  There were no
clear varices during EGD.  Lactate improved with resuscitation.
Hemodynamics improved throughout ICU course following NS boluses
and blood transfusions.  Patient initially received total of 3
PRBCs, last unit resulted in Hct 25 -> 28.  He was initially put
on octreotide and PPI gtt. He was initially kept NPO, advanced
diet to clears 2 days after presentation.  Coags and platelets
showed evidence of consumption, with low fibrinogen initially,
which improved, and platelets ~100,000.  Patient was then
transferred to floor.  Repeat EGD on [**2199-12-3**] showed duodenitis,
gastritis, multiple small ulcers in stomach cardia, ulcer in
stomach cardia with visible vessel that was injected and
clipped, and polyp in mid-esophagus.  There were no varices and
octreotide gtt was discontinued.  Hct initially remained stable
between 28 and 31.  On morning of [**2199-12-4**], BP was noted to be
low at 70s/40s.  Stat Hct was checked and had dropped to 23.  BP
improved minimally with IV fluids; he was also given 2 units
PRBCs.  He was transferred back to the ICU on [**2199-12-4**] for
hemodynamic monitoring.  A repeat EGD showed blood in stomach
and another small gastric cardia ulcer with visible vessel.
Area was clipped and patient received 2 additional units of
PRBCs.  His hct remained stable and he was transferred back to
the floor with a PPI drip. On [**2199-12-7**], his diet was advanced to
full liquids and then to regular diet. He was discharged on
pantoprazole 40 mg po BID.

# Positive H.Pylori Seroliges:  Patient was started on a 14-day
course of PPI, amoxicillin, and clarithromycin.

#Transaminitis: Transaminitis on admission (ALT 29, AST 61) on
admission.  RUQ ultrasound reve
