Dyspnea on exertion

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:

History of Present Illness:
Mrs. [**Known lastname **] in an 80-year-old female with a known history of
hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy who has been having more
disabling shortness of breath and become much more symptomatic
in the last few months. Echocardiography showed moderate to
severe mitral regurgitation with thickening of the septum and
systolic anterior motion related mitral regurgitation and
obstruction. I discussed the proposed surgical options with the
patient
and her son at length and discussed the possibility for either
mitral valve replacement or mechanical valve and Coumadin
therapy long-term and they agreed to proceed.


Past Medical History:
--diastolic CHF
--obstructive CM with LVOT gradient 70 in [**2143**]
--TTE [**2143**]: Conclusions: LVOT gradient 70
1. There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The
left ventricular cavity size is normal. Regional left
ventricular wall motion is normal. Left ventricular systolic
function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%). There is a severe resting
left ventricular outflow tract/mid cavitary obstruction. 2. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. Trace aortic
regurgitation is seen.
3. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate to
severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The mitral
regurgitation jet is eccentric. 4. Compared with the findings of
the prior study (tape reviewed) of [**2142-8-22**], the left ventricular
outflow tract/mid cavitary obstruction and mitral regurgitation
are worse.

Pertinent Results:
[**2145-8-26**] ECHO
PRE-BYPASS: The left atrium is mildly dilated. No spontaneous
echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium
or left atrial appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D
or color Doppler. There is severe symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. There
is a moderate resting left ventricular outflow tract
obstruction. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. There are simple atheroma in the ascending aorta.
The descending thoracic aorta is mildly dilated. There are
simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. There are
three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis. Trace
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. An eccentric, XXX directed jet of Severe (4+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial effusion.


POST CPB:
1. Preserved biventricular systolic function.
2. Mechanical prosthesis in mitral positon. Well seated and
mechamically
stable with good leaflet excursion.
3. Peak gradient 3.0 mm Hg.
4. MVA by PHT > 4 cm2.
5. Mild MR.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known firstname **] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2145-8-26**] for surgical
management of her mitral valve disease. She was taken directly
to the operating room where she underwent a mitral valve
replacement using a 27mm St. [**Male First Name (un) 923**] Mechanical Valve. Please see
operative report for details. Postoperatively she was taken to
the intensive care unit for monitoring. By postoperative day
one, she had awoken neurologically intact and was extubated.
Beta blockade, aspirin and coumadin for her mechanical valve
were started. On postoperative day two, she was transferred to
the step down unit for further recovery. She was gently diuresed
towards her preoperative weight. She had a burst of atrial
fibrillation which was treated with an increase in her beta
blockade. The physical therapy service was consulted for
assistance with her postoperative strength and mobility. She
again developed atrial fibrillation and amiodarone was started.
She subsequently converted back to a normal sinus rhythm. Her
INR was 2.5 and she was ready for discharge to rehab on [**9-2**].
