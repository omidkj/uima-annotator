HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 65-year-old
white male with a history of type 2 diabetes and extensive
peripheral vascular disease who was initially admitted to the
Podiatry Service with a left forefoot cellulitis with
associated fevers and chills.  There was no trauma or foreign
body associated with the cellulitis.  Therefore, it was
opened and drained.  The patient was started on intravenous
antibiotics.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Type 2 diabetes.
2.  Hypertension.
3.  Peripheral vascular disease.
4.  Hypercholesterolemia.
5.  Gastroesophageal reflux disease.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:
1.  Multiple foot surgeries.
2.  Right lower extremity bypass.
3.  Femoral-popliteal bypass.
4.  Aortobifemoral bypass.
5.  Graft in the renal artery.
6.  Endarterectomy.
7.  Umbilical hernia repair.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Glucovance 5/500 mg p.o. b.i.d.,
hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg p.o. q.d., metoprolol 100 mg p.o.
b.i.d., Norvasc 2.5 mg p.o. b.i.d., Zestril 40 mg p.o. q.d.,
Lipitor 40 mg p.o. q.d., Prilosec 20 mg p.o. q.d.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Physical examination
on admission revealed the patient was alert and oriented
times three.  Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat examination
revealed were pupils were equal, round, and reactive to
light.  Extraocular movements were intact.  Cardiovascular
examination revealed a regular rate and rhythm.  Normal first
heart sound and second heart sound.  No murmurs, gallops or
rubs.  Lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally.  No
wheezes, rhonchi, or rales.  The abdomen was soft, nontender,
and nondistended.  No guarding.  Extremities revealed left
foot with erythema and edema, an open wound from incision
1 cm long.  Dorsalis pedis and posterior tibialis pulses were
nonpalpable bilaterally.  Left foot was very warm.  Good
movement, and biphasic on Doppler.

ASSESSMENT:  This is a 44-year-old male with a past medical
history of type 2 diabetes, initially admitted for a left
lower extremity cellulitis with hospital course complicated
by a non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction, complicated
catheterization, and workup of left upper lobe mass found on
a pre-catheterization chest x-ray.

HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM:

1.  CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM:  The patient was originally
admitted on [**2121-10-23**] for left lower extremity
cellulitis to the Podiatry Service.

On [**2121-10-25**] the patient developed shortness of breath
and bilateral shoulder pain and ruled in for a non-Q-wave
myocardial infarction.  At that time, the patient was
transferred to the C-MED Service.  The patient had 1-mm ST
elevations in leads I and aVL with 2-mm ST depressions in
leads III, aVF, and V3 through V6.

The patient did not immediately undergo catheterization given
that he was still febrile from his left lower extremity
cellulitis, and it was unclear whether or not he would be
okay to have stents placed given his history of
osteomyelitis.

In addition, in the interval between developing the
non-Q-wave myocardial infarction, the patient also had some
hemoptysis which was followed up with a CT of the chest which
showed a left upper lobe mass.

Once the patient was afebrile, the patient underwent
catheterization.  The procedure was complicated by a small
dissection.  The patient had six stents placed in the right
coronary artery.  Given these complications, the patient was
transferred to the Coronary Care Unit for overnight
observation.

The patient was then transferred back to the C-MED Service.
It should also be noted that the patient also had a
echocardiogram after his myocardial infarction which was
significant for a moderately dilated left atrium, mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy, with a normal left
ventricular cavity size, overall left ventricular systolic
function preservation; although, mild basal inferior
hypokinesis could not be excluded.  The right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion were normal.  Simple
atheroma on the aortic roots were seen.  The ascending aorta
was mildly dilated.  The aortic valve leaflets were
thickened.  No aortic regurgitation was seen.  The mitral
valve leaflets were mildly thickened with mild mitral
regurgitation.  Left ventricular inflow pattern suggested
impaired.  Ejection fraction of greater than 55% was
determined.

The patient remained stable on the C-MED Service and was
eventually transferred to the General Medicine Service.

2.  PULMONARY SYSTEM:  The patient apparently had a left
upper lobe mass which was seen on chest x-ray one month prior
to his presentation with left lower extremity cellulitis at
that time.  No further workup was done.  While in house the
patient developed hemoptysis, and a left lower lobe mass was
also seen on a follow-up chest x-ray.

A CT of the chest was done on [**10-27**] which showed a left
upper lobe mass that was speculated which was 3.6-cm X 5.3-cm
in size.

The patient was seen by the Pulmonary Service in house, and
he was preliminarily diagnosed with a likely stage III-B
bronchogenic lung cancer.  In order to make the full
diagnosis, the patient would need a tissue biopsy; however,
given his recent myocardial infarction, mediastinoscopy by
Cardiothoracic Surgery was deferred until the patient
recovered from his acute cardiovascular events.

3.  INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  The patient was treated for a left
lower extremity cellulitis with intravenous antibiotics while
he was in house.  The patient was treated with ciprofloxacin,
Flagyl, and oxacillin for cultures which grew out
Staphylococcus coagulase-positive bacteria.

The patient had a bone scan to both rule out metastases from
his lung mass and also to determine if there was any
osteomyelitis.  As per Podiatry, no osteomyelitis was
suggested, and the patient was continued on oxacillin while
in the hospital and changed over to oral dicloxacillin when
he was discharged from the hospital.

4.  FLUIDS/ELECTROLYTES/NUTRITION:  The patient seemed to
have some hyponatremia while in the hospital.  The patient
was fluid restricted.  It was unclear whether or not the
patient had syndrome of inappropriate secretion of
antidiuretic hormone.  A hyponatremia workup was initiated
while in house, and the patient was to follow up with his
primary care physician regarding the results of these tests.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:  (The patient's discharge diagnoses
included)
1.  Left lower extremity cellulitis.
2.  Non-Q-wave myocardial infarction.
3.  Status post catheterization complicated by a small
dissection and six stent placement.
4.  A left upper lobe mass.
5.  Hyponatremia.
6.  Anemia.

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  The patient condition on discharge
was fair.
