History of Present Illness:
52 M cambodian native w/ h/o hep B treated w/ IFn-a and adefovir
followed by entecovir. THe patient had been taking no
medications for approximately 2 years. He was transferred from
[**Hospital 794**] Hospital, RI, with N/V, weakness and abdominal pain with
associated jaundice for ~2weeks. At the time of transfer, the
patient had worsening LFTs to ALT 928, AST 624, Bili of 26.8
(direct 16.3), INR of 4.9 and Cr of 1.7. On arrival at [**Hospital1 18**] he
had a MELD of 41

Brief Hospital Course:
Pt was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] where he underwent a transplant workup
by the hepatology and transplant surgery services. On [**5-5**] he
was listed as a transplant candidate with a MELD of 41. On [**5-6**]
he was transferred to the SICU in preparation for a possible
iver transplant. Unfortunately the procedure was unable to
proceed due to poor donor graft. He remained in the SICU under
the managment of the transplant surgery service and the SICU
team.

On [**5-8**] he was once again prepared for a possible liver
transplant but on the following morning he developed tachycardia
with ST depressions on EKG. The transplant was cancelled and an
urgent cardiology consult obtained. They recommended urgent
heart catheterization, however his elevated INR required
correction w/ 9U FFP prior to procedure. Cath identified 80%
circumflex lesions that were deemed unstentable and cardiology
recommended rate control.  After receiving blood products the
patient developed pulmonary edema requiring treatment with lasix
and noninvasive ventilation (BiPAP). The following morning his
respiratory status had improved and BiPAP d/c'd. He also
received 2U PRBCs for Hcts 24 to maximize oxygen carrying
capacity.

On the afternoon of [**5-11**] he developed a rapid drop in blood
pressure requiring urgent IV fluids, placement of a central
line, intubation, and initiation of pressors. An echo obtained
at this time demonstrated hyperdynamic left ventricle and he was
presumed to be septic and antibiotics were started. His urine
output on this day was minimal and his creatinine had risen to
3.3. Bladder pressure was 19 and the patient was not felt to
have compartment syndrome.

By [**5-12**] his blood pressure had improved sufficiently to
discontinue pressors but he remained intubated due to his mental
status. His INR remained elevated (7.3) and he received FFP for
correction. He underwent bronchoscopy and one of the BAL samples
grew mold which was eventually speciated to Aspergillis for
which he was started on Voriconazole.

His multisystem organ failure worsened over the next several
days ([**2133-5-12**]): Despite several days without sedation his
neurologic status worsened until he was no longer withdrawing to
painful stimuli and his pupillary reflexes became nonexistent.
His hemodynamic status worsened as evidenced by the progression
from intermittent pressors to requiring increasing doses of
levophed. His course was further complicated by oliguric renal
failure with rising creatinine, which peaked at 8.4. His liver
failure likewise worsened with Tbili's climing to 32 and
coagulopathy marked by INRs > 7.

In the setting of pulmonary aspergillosis, the patient was not a
transplant candidate until he could receive at least two weeks
of treatment and demonstrate clearing of the fungal infection.
After consultation among the teams involved in the patient's
care (transplant surgery, hepatology, SICU, infectious disease)
consensus was reached that supporting the patient through
multisystem organ failure for that amount of time was extremely
unlikely. Several conversations were had with the family
explaining that the patient's accumulated physiologic insults
had made further treatment futile. The family agreed to
withdrawal of care and within half an hour of extubation the
patient died on [**5-17**].
