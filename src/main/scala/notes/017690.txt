Then, about 3 days PTA, patient felt feverish at home and had
prodressive shortness of breath and cough. He also had
increasing production of yellow sputum. The dyspnea, cough, and
sputum production increased to the point where he presented to
the ED for evaluation.

nausea, vomiting, dysuria, diarrhea. Patient was given dilt 20mg
x 1, 25mg x 1 for a flutter, then dropped pressures to 70s. They
were then 90s after starting dopamine, but patient became tachy.
He was off dopamine before transfer to the floor. He recieved
levofloxacin for PNA and lasix 20 IV. He received aspirin as
well. He did not give levophed though listed. He has an 18x2 and
20PIV, and left IJ for access.  His BNP was elevated at 6800 and

Imaging:
CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2127-6-9**] 1:38 PM
IMPRESSION:  Mild pulmonary edema.  Left base opacity may be
atelectasis,
however, pneumonia should be excluded in the appropriate
clinical setting.
Post-diuresis films would be of utility in excluding underlying
infection.

CHEST PORT. LINE PLACEMENT Study Date of [**2127-6-9**] 5:08 PM
FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient
has received a
new left internal jugular vein catheter.  The tip of the
catheter projects
over the upper to mid SVC.  The course of the catheter is
unremarkable.  There is no evidence of complications, notably no
pneumothorax.
Otherwise, the radiograph is unchanged as compared to 1:32 p.m.
on the same day.

TTE (Complete) Done [**2127-6-10**] at 3:43:44 PM      FINAL
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Due to
suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality
cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is normal (LVEF 65%). There is considerable
beat-to-beat variability of the left ventricular ejection
fraction due to an irregular rhythm. Right ventricular chamber
size and free wall motion are normal. The ascending aorta is
mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Mild (1+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild to moderate
([**1-20**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is borderline
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
effusion.

ECHO [**6-13**]:
No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of
the left atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of the right
atrium/right atrial appendage. Right atrial appendage ejection
