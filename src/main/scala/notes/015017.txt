Service: Medicine
NOTE:  This is an interim discharge summary.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 50-year-old
male with past medical history significant for biventricular
heart failure with an ejection fraction of 20 to 25%, no coronary
artery disease per catheterization in [**2135-10-20**], insulin
dependent diabetes mellitus, congestive heart failure,
hypertension and chronic renal insufficiency who presented to the
Emergency Department with complaints of nausea, vomiting as well
as progressive shortness of breath x24 hours.  In addition, he is
also having bilateral shoulder pain.  Prior to his symptoms, the
patient felt he had a "cold" coming on with chills, but no
fevers.  His nausea and vomiting prevented him from taking his
medications, including his Lasix and also had a decreased po
intake.  The patient denied any cough, abdominal pain, urinary
symptoms, and shortness of breath prompted him to come to the
Emergency Department.

In the Emergency Room, the patient was intubated for hypoxic
respiratory therapy.  The patient was given 140 mg intravenous of
Lasix and 10 units of regular insulin, 5 mg Lopressor
intravenous, sedation, and intravenous fluids only initially.
The patient received 2 gm of ceftriaxone.

ventricular ejection fraction of 20 to 25% in [**2135-10-20**])

pulmonary hypertension
2.  Of note, the patient had catheterization [**2135-10-20**]
that revealed no coronary artery disease.
3.  Insulin dependent diabetes mellitus
4.  Chronic renal failure with a baseline creatinine of 4.2
to 4.5.
5.  Diabetic retinopathy

ALLERGIES:  ACE INHIBITOR CAUSES COUGH.  ASPIRIN WAS NOT
RECOMMENDED PER OPHTHALMOLOGY.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is on disability, lives with
wife, denies smoking, alcohol use, intravenous drug use.

PHYSICAL EXAM UPON PRESENTATION:
VITAL SIGNS:  95.8??????, blood pressure 158/78, heart rate
between 98 to 121, respiratory rate in 30s and patient was
98% though per Emergency Department note ventilation setting
was nausea and vomiting.
GENERAL:  The patient was intubated and sedated.
HEAD, EARS, EYES, NOSE AND THROAT:  Reactive left pupil and a
surgical right pupil.
CARDIAC:  Normal, S1, S2 and tachycardia.
LUNGS:  Diffuse coarse rales bilaterally.
ABDOMEN:  Benign.
EXTREMITIES:  No cyanosis, clubbing, edema, no bilateral
extremities.

LABORATORY DATA UPON ADMISSION AND IMAGING:  White blood cell
count was 17.1, hematocrit 33.2, platelets 272, MCV 88 with a
differential of 93% neutrophils, no bands 4.4 lymphocytes,
2.1 monocytes, no eosinophils.  Chem-7 notes a sodium 131,
potassium 5.3, chloride 98, bicarbonate 8, BUN 91 which is up
from a baseline of 70 to 90 and a creatinine of 5.1 up from a
baseline of 4.2 to 4.5 and a glucose of 375.  Phosphate 6.8,
magnesium 1.5, PT 14.4, INR 1.4, PTT of 29.9.  AST 30, ALT
42, alkaline phosphatase 118, LDH 507, amylase 54, lipase 49.
Serum acetone was negative.  In initial cardiac enzymes, CK
of 966 with an MB of 7 and troponin of 0.3.
Electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia with left axis
deviation, normal intervals, T-wave inversions in V5 through
V6, questionable ST elevation of V3 and left atrial
enlargement compared to baseline.  A chest x-ray showed
bilateral patchy diffuse infiltrates consistent with
congestive heart failure, ARDS versus a multilobar pneumonia.
Preintubation arterial blood gas showed a pH of 7.19/23/70.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient is a 50-year-old male with
history of biventricular heart failure nonischemic in origin,
diabetes mellitus, hypertension, chronic renal failure
presenting with apparent congestive heart failure
exacerbation, acute on chronic renal failure and metabolic
acidosis.

1.  Hypoxic respiratory failure: Secondary to congestive heart
failure exacerbation given no history of biventricular failure,
though exact etiology unclear.  [**Name2 (NI) 116**] be secondary to decreased
medication compliance in the setting of viral syndrome and poor
po intake.  Cardiac enzymes may remain negative, however patient
had an increased CK.  The patient was given Lasix in the Medical
Intensive Care Unit and diuresed about 6 liters over the first
two hospital days. The patient was successfully extubated on
hospital day #3 and was called out to the floor on the following
day with O2 saturation of 97% on 4 liters nasal cannula.  The
patient was diuresed throughout the remainder of his hospital
stay.  The patient was also continued on hydralazine, Imdur, and
digoxin.  The patient remained fluid restricted with strict Is
and Os.  The patient was treated with bicarbonate in the Medical
Intensive Care Unit, with improvement of his acid based status.
Upon transfer to the floor, the patient had a resolved metabolic
acidosis.

2.  Acute on chronic renal failure:  The renal service was
consulted for further diagnosis and management of the renal
issues.  Impression is that this acute on chronic renal failure
was likely to be secondary to ATN due to perhaps a component of
elevated CPKs and hypoperfusion.  The patient's creatinine level
peaked to a level 5.6 on hospital day #3 and then remained stable
with continued improvement and decrease in daily creatinine
levels throughout the remainder of hospital stay.  The patient
continued to have good urine output through this time and the
patient was continued on Epo and Phos-Lo for his renal failure.

3.  Infectious disease:  The patient presented with a viral type
syndrome.  However, in the Medical Intensive Care Unit, the
patient developed fevers of unclear source.  The patient was pan
cultured, though culture remained negative and was started on
antibiotics which was discontinued upon arrival to the floor
given patient's defervescence by that time.  The patient remained
afebrile with a decreased white blood cell count through the
remainder of hospital stay.  Source of fever is unknown at the
time of discharge.

4.  Endocrine:  The patient has a history of diabetes mellitus
and requires an insulin drip while in the unit. Prior to transfer
to the floor from the Intensive Care Unit, this insulin drip was
discontinued and the patient was covered with a regular insulin
sliding scale.  The patient was then started on NPH and continued
on a regular insulin sliding scale throughout the remainder of
hospital stay with good glycemic control.

5.  Gastrointestinal:  Upon returning to the floor, the patient
again experienced symptoms of nausea and episodes of emesis.  The
patient was treated symptomatically with Compazine and diet
changed to clear liquids at the time of discharge.  This is
likely due to perhaps similar gastroenteritis that the patient
experienced at presentation.

He is to be discharged to a rehabilitation facility.  He will
follow up with his PCP, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], in [**Company 191**].
