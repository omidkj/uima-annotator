Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4760**]
Chief Complaint:
Transfer from OSH with DVT and PE

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
thrombolysis for significant clot burden and visible clot in R
atria

History of Present Illness:
This is a 57 year old gentleman with a history of ulcerative
colitis who is transferred from [**Hospital3 1443**] Hospital ED at
the patient's request with a diagnoiss of DVT and PE. He had
been in his usual state of health until a few weeks ago, he
noted left sided calf pains. He did not think much of this as he
had a friend who had an achilles injury that was similar.
However, 3 days ago, he came home early from work feeling tired
and with generalized weakness. He then noticed that he was
feeling increasingly short of breath. His shortness of breath
persisted and he began to have dyspnea even with minimal
exertion such as walking to the bathroom. He notes that 2 days
prior, he was in the bathroom when he felt severely dyspneic and
lightheaded. The next thing he remembers is waking up with his
head leaning on the toilet seat. He believes that he lost
consciousness for a few seconds. His breathing stabilized over
the next day, but he began to have much more severe left sided
leg pain, radiating to his thigh. This resulted in him seeing
his PCP urgently today. Following his PCP visit, he had an outpt
US done which revealed a left sided distal femoral vein DVT and
he was asked to go to the ED for a CTA. He was seen at [**Hospital1 3793**] ED where he had a CTA that revealed extensive acute
pulmonary emboli. He was started on coumadin 10 mg PO and
heparin bolus of 5000 units. He was then transferred to the
[**Hospital1 18**] ED at the patient's request. Of note, he did travel to [**Location (un) 73711**] by plane on [**11-6**] to visit his son, prior to the onset of
the above symptoms. Otherwise denies personal or family history
of thrombotic events. No recent hospitalizations or surgeries.

EDVS:
98.6 HR 99 BP 136/70 RR 14 97% 2L. He was given lovenox 80 mg SQ
x 1 and admitted to the medicine service.
.
On the floor, he feels that his breathing is improved. He
currently does not have LLE pain. His pain is reproducible with
exertion.
.
ROS: Positive for chills several days ago. Also with fleeting
palpitations about 3 days ago. Denies chest pain. Also denies
fever, night sweats, headache, vision changes, rhinorrhea,
congestion, sore throat, cough, abdominal pain, nausea,
vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, BRBPR, melena, hematochezia,
dysuria, hematuria.

.
[**11-14**] ECHO:
The left atrium is normal in size. A mobile 2 x 1.4cm mass is
seen in the right atrium. It appears to be attached to the
Eustachian valve. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size
and regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%).
Transmitral Doppler and tissue velocity imaging are consistent
with normal LV diastolic function. There is no left ventricular
outflow obstruction at rest or with Valsalva. Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve appears
structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is
no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mobile mass in the right atrium measuring 2 x 1.4cm.
It is associated with the Eustachian valve and has the
appearance of a thrombus. It prolapses back and forth into the
inferior vena cava. Spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the
IVC, consistent with slow flow. The right ventricle has normal
size and function. Normal regional and global left ventricular
systolic function without significant valvular abnormality.
.
[**11-15**] ECHO:
Focused Study: No mass or thrombus is seen in the right atrium
or right atrial appendage. There is a prominent Chiari network
versus Eustachian valve seen in the right atrium. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right
ventricular chamber size is normal. with normal free wall
contractility. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally
normal with good leaflet excursion. No aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is
no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2136-11-14**],
the right atrial mass/thrombus is no longer present.
.
CT venogram [**11-19**]: prelim read: No evidence of new venous
thrombosis. Interval resolution of IVC thrombus. 3 low
attenuation liver lesions, likely benign.


Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 57 year old with a history of ulcerative colitis
admitted with left lower extremity DVT and extensive bilateral
PE.
.
# DVT/PE: Extensive emboli involving all pulmonary lobes and DVT
in LLE found on LENI and CTA chest at outside hospital. Possibly
provoked by immobility with travel although could also be
considered unprovoked. Patient was intially managed with lovenox
and coumadin.  However, ECHO performed upon transfer showed
mobile clot in IVC and RA.  Lovenox and coumadin were held and
patient was transferred to the CCU where he received tPA
infusion 100 mg over 2 hours on [**11-14**].  Heparin gtt was
restarted once his PTT was < 60 and he received coumadin the day
after his tPA infusion after having no evidence of bleeding
complications.  Repeat ECHO showed resolution of prior
visualized clot suggesting successful thrombolysis.  He remained
hemodynamically stable throughout admission. He had no O2
requirement and no subjective SOB.  He was transitioned to subQ
lovenox at 1 mg/kg dosing [**Hospital1 **] 2 days after his tPA. He remained
in house for close monitoring given significant clot burden and
persistent discomfort in L calf from DVT. Vascular surgery was
consulted who recomm
