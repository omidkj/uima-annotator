History of Present Illness:
60 yo M with dilated cardiomyopathy (EF 15%) and poor past
medical compliance who presented to OSH on [**5-20**] with SOB, LE
edema and chest congestion. In the ED he was found to be in AF
with RVR (150 bpm) and hypotensive. He was given lopressor,
adenosine and verapamil in the ED but did not convert, so he was
cardioverted electrically and returned to sinus rhythm.
.
Pt was in his usual state of health until one year ago when his
second round of lithotripsy was cancelled because of
tachycardia. On follow-up, his HR was 80-90 bpm, but he did not
follow up with the echo and ETT that were ordered. About two
weeks prior to this admission he began feeling short of breath
and "congested", which he attributed to his allergies. His
family notes that he began cutting back on his gardening and did
not feel able to dog-sit for his daughter. [**Name (NI) **] was seen by a
physician for his "allergies" and was prescribed a steroid
inhaler and ordered a cardiac echo. Echo on [**2160-5-16**] showed EF 15%
and WMAs. He then followed up with his PCP for continued SOB and
EKG showed narrow complex tachycardia at 150-160 with poor
R-wave progression, and he was sent to the ED.
.
In the OSH ED, he also received lasix and antibiotics as
empirical treatment for ? pneumonia. He deteriorated overnight
and required intubation and pressors (dobutamine and dopamine).
He also received solu-medrol for ? COPD flare. A right IJ was
placed.

On review of systems, he notes cough productive of brown-colored
phlegm but no hemoptysis or hematemesis. He also notes pedal
edema and orthopnea. He denies any prior history of stroke, TIA,
pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias,
joint pains. He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors. He
denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other review
of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, palpitations, syncope or
presyncope.

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 60 year-old gentleman with dilated cardiomyopathy (EF
15%) who was admitted in cardiogenic shock and rapid Aflutter
now s/p AF ablation and s/p impella device, s/p dialysis for ATN
and s/p self-extubation.
.
PUMP: Mr. [**Known lastname 37557**] was transferred from an outside hospital in
cardiogenic shock in the setting of dilated cardiomyopathy with
EF 15% on echo and Aflutter with rapid ventricular response. He
was transferred with dopamine and dobutamine for hemodynamic
support and was stable on these pressors. An echocardiogram on
arrival to [**Hospital1 18**] showed LVEF 10%, ASD with L->R shunt, LV
dilation, RV dilation, RV severe global free wall hypokinesis.
On the day after admission, he was switched to phenylephrine and
milrinone and an impella device was placed in the cath lab for
left ventricular support. A swan-ganz catheter was also placed
for hemodynamic monitoring. Initial fick numbers were
5.7/2.9/1103 on the Impella device. In addition, he was started
on prednisone 40mg daily for the possibility of giant cell
myositis underlying his dilated cardiomyopathy, but this was
stopped after two days as his CO improved with the impella
device, the low likelihood of myositis in this clinical
scenario. In addition, due to initial concern that he might
deteriorate and require cardiac transplantation, he was tested
for Hep A,B,C and CMV Abs which were all negative. An
echocardiogram was repeated after the impella device was placed
and showed mild decrease in LV size and mildly improved LV
function to 10-20% EF. Another echo on [**5-25**] showed continued
improvement in systolic function with EF 40%, and the impella
was removed. Pressors were weaned off on the following day, and
another echo showed EF 30-35% and improved RV free wall motion.
Another echo on [**5-27**] during AF/flutter showed overall improving
LV function but significantly impaired SV during beats following
short diastolic filling times, with an EF ranging from 20-40%
depending on diastolic filling time. Rate control therefore
became his primary goal, as described below. Phenylephrine was
required initially to accomodate the higher doses of metoprolol,
but was discontinued on [**6-2**], after which he remained
hemodynamically stable both in NSR and occasional AFib without
pressors.
.
He was initially volume overloaded and was gently diuresed for
preload reduction and relief of his pulmonary edema, but
required pressors for hemodynamic support. He initially
responded well to lasix, but as his renal function deteriorated,
he required diuril to maintain urine output. On [**5-23**], it was
determined that he had ATN (see renal section below), and on
[**5-24**] his urine output dropped significantly despite lasix and
diuril. CVVH was started on [**5-26**], which was transitioned to
intermittent HD through a temporary R IJ line and ultimately a
tunneled line was placed by IR for HD on [**6-5**].
.
RHYTHM: His initial EKGs from OSH showed likely Afib vs Aflutter
with 2:1 block that was refractory to lopressor, adenosine,
verapamil and converted with DCCV. He remained tachycardic
(120-140) for the first day of admission and underwent ablation
on [**5-23**] for atrial flutter.  This initially reverted him to
sinus rhyt
