Service:  MICU

HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 59-year-old female
with an extensive recent past medical history including
Pseudomonas abdominal abscess, vancomycin-resistant
Enterococcal bacteremia, and severe right heart failure
well-healed presented from her nursing home with five to six
days of malaise and confusion.

On [**2159-4-21**], she was noted to be confused, had a cough
with brown sputum and complained of a sore throat.  A chest
x-ray was performed as an outpatient that reportedly showed
pulmonary edema and bilateral effusions.  Still, the
patient's oxygen saturations were said to be in the mid 90s
on 4 liters nasal cannula which is her baseline.  Her Lasix
and Zaroxolyn doses were increased with good diuretic
response.

She spiked a temperature to 101.6.  On [**2159-4-23**], she
began refusing food and became increasingly disoriented and
confused.  She reportedly complained of epigastric pain,
nausea, and back pain.  She denied chest pain, melena, and
diarrhea.  Because of her mental status changes and fever,
she was sent to the Emergency Room for further evaluation.

In the Emergency Room, she was found to be disoriented and
confused.  Her systolic blood pressure was in the 70s and
dopamine was started with good response; the blood pressure
increased to the 100s.  She was given 3 liters of normal
saline IV.  Her INR was found to be 16 for which she was
given 4 units of FFP and 5 mg of vitamin K p.o.  Her chest
x-ray showed a right lower lobe infiltrate and she was given
vancomycin, levofloxacin, and Flagyl and admitted to the
Intensive Care Unit.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Positive family history for diabetes
mellitus and no family history for cirrhosis.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  She lives at [**Hospital 1475**] Nursing Home where
she has been for the last year since her admission in [**2158**]
for Pseudomonal abscess.  She walks across the room
independently but remains chronically debilitated from her
prior severe illness.  The closest relative is her brother,
Mr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Known lastname 39094**].  She has a positive history of tobacco use
but details are unclear.  [**Name2 (NI) **] history of ethanol or drug use.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Vital signs:  Temperature
101.0, heart rate 92, blood pressure 96/34, respirations 18,
oxygen saturation 95% on 4 liters and 90% on room air.
General:  She was inattentive but verbal, disoriented, frail,
and chronically ill appearing, and in no acute distress.
HEENT:  The pupils were equal, round, and reactive to light.
She had a dense cataract in the right eye.  Extraocular
motions were intact.  There was no scleral icterus.  No
nystagmus.  Neck:  No lymphadenopathy.  JVD was seen 10 cm
above the sternal angle at 30 degrees.  Pulmonary:  The
patient was not compliant with examination.  There were
decreased breath sounds and expiratory wheezes at the right
base and rales at the left base.  Cardiovascular:  Normal S1,
loud S2, regular rate and rhythm, no S3 or S4.  Abdomen:
Soft, nontender, nondistended, positive bowel sounds.  The
patient refused Guaiac in the Emergency Room.  She had a
large surgical scar in the left abdomen that was nontender
and well healed.  Extremities:  No peripheral edema, 2+
dorsalis pedis pulses.  Neurologic:  She moves all four
extremities.  She was oriented to self only, inattentive.
She had asterixis.  Skin:  There was mild skin breakdown of
the sacrum.  There was a stage IV decubitus ulcer at the
right hip.  Back examination was notable for a completely
nontender spine examination.

LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION:  White count 12.7.  The
differential revealed 86% neutrophils, 8% lymphocytes, 4%
monocytes, hematocrit 31.6, platelets 413,000, mean cell
volume 79.  PT 49.2, PTT 71.5, INR 16.0.  Chem-7:  Sodium
139, potassium 5.2, chloride 99, bicarbonate 22, BUN 160,
creatinine 5.3, glucose 85.  Albumin 2.8, calcium 9.9,
phosphate 6.2, magnesium 2.5, ALT 40, AST 48, amylase 68,
total bilirubin 1.5.  CK 39, MB 4, troponin less than 0.3.
The urinalysis showed a specific gravity of 1.012, moderate
blood, negative nitrates, trace protein, negative glucose,
negative ketones, negative bilirubin, pH 5.0, small leukocyte
esterase.  Cell count 0-2 red blood cells, 0-2 white blood
cells, occasional bacteria, no yeast.

RADIOLOGY:  Chest x-ray showed increased heart size with
prominent pulmonary vasculature, likely represented CHF, no
evidence of pneumothorax or large pleural effusions.  There
was an infiltrate in the left lower lobe.

KUB showed no evidence of obstruction.

Abdominal ultrasound showed no evidence of ascites.

CAT scan of the head showed no intracranial hemorrhage.

EKG showed atrial flutter at 85 beats per minute with an old
Q wave in lead III, T wave inversions in V2 to V6 and II,
III, and aVF, and [**Street Address(2) 4793**] depression in lead V2.  There was
poor R wave progression.

An echocardiogram from [**2158-5-8**] had revealed an ejection
fraction of greater than 55% and severe global right
ventricular hypokinesis with 4+ tricuspid regurgitation and
moderate pulmonary hypertension.

IMPRESSION:  This is a 59-year-old female with a history of
pseudomonal intra-abdominal abscess and known right
ventricular failure who presented with deteriorating mental
status at her nursing home, fever, chest x-ray consistent
with CHF, coagulopathy, and acute on chronic renal failure.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  1.  CHANGE IN MENTAL STATUS: The patient's
change in mental status is felt to be multifactorial.  The
patient had acute renal failure with a significant uremia.
This was treated as discussed below.  Once her uremia was at
its baseline, the patient remained confused and disoriented
suggesting an additional etiology or etiologies to her
persistent neurologic impairment.  Because she carried a past
history of hepatic encephalopathy and was being treated as an
outpatient with Neomycin, we initiated treatment with
Lactulose.  Additionally, we felt an infectious etiology was
likely contributing to her delirium.

2.  INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  Given the patient's hypotension,
fever, and history of Pseudomonal abscess, the Surgery
Service was consulted in the Emergency Room to assess whether
there could be an intra-abdominal source of infection.  They
felt that this was unlikely given the examination and
radiographic findings.

We next turned our attention to the possibility of a
pulmonary source of infection. She was started on
levofloxacin which was immediately changed to meropenem given
her history of ceftazidime-resistant pseudomonal infection.
A bedside thoracic ultrasound was performed which revealed
low likelihood of effusion.

A chest CT performed on [**2159-4-27**] revealed a loculated
right pleural effusion whose appearance was most consistent
with hemothorax, although empyema could not be excluded.
There was dense at
