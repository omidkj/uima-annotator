Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 398**]
Chief Complaint:
Altered mental status

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Attempted LP

History of Present Illness:
83 M w/ pmh of ESRD on HD, Afib s/p AVN ablation and
dual-chamber PM, systolic CHF (EF 25%, 2+AS, 3+MR) transferred
from nursing home, w/ MS change. His son who accompanies him
says that he has noticed an increase in his RR over the past few
days and a decrease in his energy level. When he went to visit
him this morning, he was very sleepy and not coherent which is a
change so they called the ambulance. BP and O2 sats there noted
to be low. He did not eat breakfast this morning which is very
unusual for him.
.
In the emergency department, initial vitals: 19:00 U 97.1 74
98/63 22. 97% on 5L NC. Arrived hypotensive in 70s, MS A+Ox3
here (but per son, not at baseline), BP unresponsive to 2L NS so
left femoral central line placed under U/S guidance (as INR 13)
and levo started. Moving arms but legs weaker. 2 U FFP, 10 vit K
IV. Cxr w/ increased CHF. Head CT NEG. Could not pass foley X 2,
now w/ small amt of blood. Given vanco 1g IV, levo 750 mg IV,
flagyl 500 mg IV. Cool hands/feet, dopplerable PT but not DP,
vasc called and will see on the floor. Guaiac + brown stool.
.
On arrival to the ICU, his son states he is more alert now but
not back to baseline.
.
Review of systems: Pt. states he feels short of breath but
cannot clarify further.

[**4-11**] CXR
FINDINGS: Comparison is made to [**2134-1-25**]. Right pacemaker and
two
intracardiac leads remain in place. Since prior exam, left IJ
hemodialysis
catheter has been placed, with tip low in position, possibly
within the IVC.
[**Year (4 digits) **] stens are noted in the left subclavian and
brachiocephalic vein.

Cardiomegaly again noted with central congestion, bilateral
pleural
effusions. Lung bases are suboptimally assessed given low lung
volumes though
compared with prior, effusion and CHF is increased.

IMPRESSION:
1. Dialysis catheter tip low, likely in IVC.
2. CHF, worse.
.
[**4-11**] CT Head

NON-CONTRAST HEAD CT: No edema, masses, mass effect, hemorrhage
or infarction
is detected. The ventricles and sulci are slightly prominent
consistent with
involutional changes. Periventricular white matter hypodensities
are
compatible with small vessel ischemic changes. Mild mucosal
thickening of the
right ethmoid sinus is unchanged. The remainder of the
visualized part of the
paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells is clear. Calcification
of cavernous
carotid arteries is noted bilaterally. There has been interval
placement of a
hearing aid device on the left side. Incidental note is made of
posterior non-
fusion of c1.

IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial pathology.
.
[**4-13**] CXR
IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**4-11**]:

Moderate right and small left pleural effusions have increased,
mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema stable or worsened. Moderate
cardiomegaly
longstanding. Left basal atelectasis severe and unchanged. No
pneumothorax.
Dual-channel left central venous line ends in the right atrium,
transvenous
right atrioventricular pacer leads in standard placements.


Brief Hospital Course:
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 83 M w/ pmh of ESRD on HD, Afib s/p AVN
ablation and dual-chamber PM, systolic CHF (EF 25%, 2+AS, 3+MR)
transferred from nursing home, w/ MS change and hypotension.
Etiology of hypotension and hypercarbia were never clarified
during his hospital course.  The hypotension was concerning for
sepsis given l-shift, indwelling HD line
