Pertinent Results:
.
EKG: sinus rhythm, rate 80, normal axis, normal intervals.  +
1-[**Street Address(2) 1766**] elevations in V1-V3, also seen on prior EKG dated
[**2163-12-4**].
.
CXR [**2-23**]:  Lung volumes are now quite low with new patchy
opacity at the right more than left lung base, likely
atelectasis.  Allowing for this, the heart size and pulmonary
vessels are likely within normal limits, and there is no
significant pleural effusion.
.
CT ABDOMEN PELVIS [**2-23**]:
1.  Moderate ascites may be secondary to third spacing, but can
also be seen secondary to more significant pathologies.  Bowel
ischemia cannot be excluded.
2.  Moderately distended gallbladder.  Acalculous cholecystitis
is possible.
3.  Stool distended colon.
4.  Bibasilar atelectasis and superimposed pneumonia.
