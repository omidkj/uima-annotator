Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1505**]
Chief Complaint:
unstable angina

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2125-10-14**] emergency CABG x3 with IABP (SVG to LAD, SVG to OM, SVG
to PDA)
Emergent left heart catheterization and coronary angiogram,
placement of IABP [**10-14**]


History of Present Illness:
This 62 year old white male presented to ER with severe angina,
shortness of breath, tingling down his left arm, and a new LBBB.
He had a  prior infarction with PTCA in [**2108**].  Acute coronary
syndrome with shock was diagnosed and therefore, he went
urgently to the catheterization lab.

In the lab he developed acute respiratory distress requiring
intubation.  Critical left main, LAD and circumflex disease were
found as well as occlusive RCA disease. An IABP was placed for
cardiogenic shock and a decision was made to proceed with
emergent coronary revascularization for myocardial salvage.


Past Medical History:
Myocardial infarction in [**2108**]
coronary angioplasty [**2102**]


Social History:
lives with brother
no tobacco or recreational drugs
occasional ETOH

Family History:
unknown

Physical Exam:
Awake, alert and oriented.  2/4 strength left arm, 3/4 strength
left leg. Full ROM sensation seems intact.  There is some
neglect of left side, unsteady gait when looks up while walking.
Mild right facial weakness. Gag and swallowing intact.
lungs- clear
cor- SR 60-60
exts- without edema
wounds- clean and dry. Stable sternum

Pertinent Results:
Conclusions
PRE-BYPASS:
The left atrium is dilated. No spontaneous echo contrast or
thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium/left atrial
appendage or the body of the right atrium/right atrial
appendage. No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in
the body of the right atrium or the right atrial appendage.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. There is severe
regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with complete
akinesis of anteroseptal and anterior walls along with moderate
depression of the entire lateral wall. The inferior and
inferolateral walls are severely hypokinetic as well.. No masses
or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle and the apex was not
well visualized.. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
severely depressed (LVEF= 10 to 15 %).
RV has mild global free wall hypokinesis.
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral
regurgitation.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IABP was initially 6cm below the Left SCA and was repositioned
to 2cm below the Left SCA.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in person of the results on Mr.[**Known lastname 80487**]
immediately after anesthesia induction and TEEexam..

POST-BYPASS: Patient is on infusions milrinone, levophed and
epinephrine and IABP
Preserved RV systolic function.
Mild improvement in septal wall motion abnormalities. LVEF 25%.
Mild to Moderate MR (This was not seen in the preoperative or
prebypass period)
Intact thoracic aorta.
Trivial TR.
IABP is positoned well,
  I certify that I was present for this procedure in compliance
with HCFA regulations.

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST   Clip # [**Clip Number (Radiology) 80488**]
Reason: r/o bleed into CVA



[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
   62 year old man with
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
   r/o bleed into CVA
CONTRAINDICATIONS FOR IV CONTRAST:
   None.



Provisional Findings Impression: AJy WED [**2125-10-24**] 12:12 PM
PFI: Right frontal lobe hypodensities consistent with evolution
of known
infarct. No evidence for hemorrhage, significant edema, or mass
effect.


Final Report
HISTORY: 62-year-old male with recent CVA. Evaluate for
hemorrhagic
conversion.

COMPARISON: CTA of the head from [**2125-10-21**] and MRI of the brain
from
[**2125-10-22**].

TECHNIQUE: Contiguous axial images were obtained through the
brain without
the administration of IV contrast.

FINDINGS: There has been interval development of multiple
partially confluent
hypodense foci in the right frontal lobe, in territory
consistent with known
recent CVA. This is consistent with expected evolution of
ischemic infarct.
There is no evidence for hemorrhage, significant edema, mass
effect, shift of
midline structures, or effacement of cisterns. The osseous
structures remain
unremarkable without suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions.
Visualized
paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells remain clear.

IMPRESSION:

1. New right frontal lobe subcortical hypodensities, consistent
with expected
evolution of ischemic infarction.

2. No evidence for hemorrhage, significant edema, or mass
effect.

The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

Sinus rhythm. First degree A-V block. Long QTc interval. Poor R
wave
progression. Possible anterior myocardial infarction, age
undetermined.
Clinical correlation is suggested. Non-specific intraventricular
conduction
delay. Anterior T wave changes suggest myocardial ischemia. Low
QRS voltage

the
ventricular rate is slower. The P-R interval is longer.
Anterolateral

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 80487**] presented to the ED with an  acute MI on [**10-14**], with
cardiogenic shock and was taken to the cath lab where
angiography revealed an 80% LM lesion and an occluded RCA. An
IABP was placed in the cath lab where he was intubated due to
respiratory distress and CHF.  He received Plavix, Integrilin
and Heparin and then was transferred to the OR emergently in
cardiogenic shock for revascularization. His EF was noted to be
10-15% by echo in the OR with a large area of infarct.  He
weaned form bypass on epinephrine, levophed, milrinone, insulin,
and propofol drips.  He had a significant amount of ventricular
ectopy post operatively and electrolytes were repleted.He
received amiodarone as well. He subsequently remained stable
postoperativley.Thge epinephrine then the Levophed were slowly
weaned, keeping his MAP>65mmHg.  The IABP was weaned to 1:2 and
removed on POD 2.  The amiodarone and Milrinone were continued
and extubation occurred on POD 2.  The Milrinone was weaned and
discontinued as an ACEI was begun, and he remained stable.

He was then transferred to the step down floor on POD 3. The
chest tubes and wires were removed.  He was seen in consultation
by the physical therapist. He was noted to have bursts of atrial
tachycardia and therefore was seen by ele
