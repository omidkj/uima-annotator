Brief Hospital Course:
On admission, Mr. [**Known lastname 41617**] [**Last Name (Titles) 1834**] a mitral valve replacement
and single vessel coronary artery bypass grafting by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1290**]. For surgical details, please see seperate operative
note. Following the operation, he was brought to the CSRU for
invasive monitoring. He initially required multiple blood
products for a postoperative coagulopathy. Once his bleeding
improved, he was weaned from sedation and awoke neurologically
intact. He was extubated without incident. He was initially kept
NPO and required an NG tube for abdominal distention. KUB at
that time was notable for large amounts of stool but no signs of
an ileus. With stool softeners, suppositories and ambulation,
his abdominal distention improved. His diet was slowly advanced
and NG tube was eventually removed without further complication.
While in the CSRU, he experienced intermittent agitation,
requiring Haldol. Over several days however, his neurological
status improved without further need on Haldol. He otherwise
maintained stable hemodynamics and eventually transferred to the
telemetry floor on postoperative day four. Beta blockade was
resumed and advanced as tolerated. He remained in a normal sinus
rhythm with first degree AV block. No atrial or ventricular
arrhtyhmias were noted. The [**Last Name (un) **] Center was consulted to
assist with the postoperative management of his diabetes
mellitus. With gentle diuresis, he continued to make clinical
improvements. Over several days, medical therapy was optimized
and he made steady progress with physical therapy. He was
cleared for discharge to home on postperative day seven. At
discharge, his BP was 120/60 with a HR of 75. His room air
saturations were 94% and his discharge chest x-ray was notable
for only small bilateral pleural effusions and a tiny, stable
left apical pneumothorax which was stable from several days
prior. His blood sugars were better controlled and all surgical
wounds were clean, dry and intact.
