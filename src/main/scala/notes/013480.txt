RADIOLOGY  Final Report

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2153-9-1**] 2:53 PM

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)

Reason: MI- evaluation of heart and lungs

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
31 year old woman with MI
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
MI- evaluation of heart and lungs
CHEST SINGLE VIEW, [**9-1**].

HISTORY: MI.

FINDINGS: There are no old films available for comparison. This
is a frontal view of the chest. The heart is upper limits of
normal in size. The lungs are clear. The extreme left CP angle
is off the film. There is no focal infiltrate or effusion. The
bony thorax is unremarkable.

IMPRESSION: Normal chest.

BRIEF HISTORY:   33 year old woman with a history of ongoing
tobacco use
and positive family history of premature sudden cardiac death
who
presented for cardiac catheterization in the setting of inferior
ST
segment elevations and chest pain following traumatic injury to
the
chest with a softball.

INDICATIONS FOR CATHETERIZATION:
Coronary artery disease, Canadian Heart Class IV,  unstable.

COMMENTS:
  1. Selective coronary angiography revealed a right dominant
system
with single vessel coronary artery disease. The LMCA, LAD, and
LCX had
no angiographically apparent flow limiting stenoses. The RCA had
a 99%
mid vessel lesion with extensive thrombus.
  2. Resting hemodynamics demonstrated mildly elevated right
sided
pressures (mean RA 12 mmHg), moderately elevated pulmonary (mean
PA 27
mmHg), and moderately elevated left sided pressures (mean PCWP
25 mmHg)
with a normal cardiac index (2.5 l/min/m2).
  3. Left ventriculography was deferred.
  4. Successful PTCA/Thrombectomy/stenting of the mid RCA with a

3.5x28mm Cypher [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 7930**] to 4.0mm with excellent results
(see
PTCA comments).
  5. Ascending aortography was performed in the 40 degree LAO
projection
at 40cc at 20cc/sec revealing NO angiographic evidence of aortic

dissection.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. One vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Moderate left ventricular diastolic dysfunction.
3. PCI of the mid RCA.
4. Normal ascending aorta.
5. Acute Inferior Myocardial Infarction.

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 31y/o female admitted for STEMI (post-trauma to the
chest)whose course was as follows:
.
1. STEMI (ST elevation myocardial infarction): The patient was
started on aspirin 325mg, lipitor 80mg, plavix 75, lisinopril 5
and lopressor 12.5 twice a day.  At the time of discharge,
lisinopril had been increased to 10mg and lopressor had been
switched to Toprol XL 50.  The patient tolerated these
medications well without any complications. The patient's CK was
166 (CK-MB:156)on admission, peaked to 1314 (CK-MB:185)and was
456 (CK-MB:29)upon discharge.
.
2. Chest trauma - A CT of the chest was considered to rule out
any type of sternal fracture.  However, given the fact that her
chest X-ray revealed a normal bony thorax, radiology did not
feel that it was clinically indicated.
.
3. Pain- The patient's pain was controlled with Tylenol and
oxycodone.
.
4. UTI- Patient's course was complicated by a urinary tract
infection. Patient was started on ciprofloxacin and was to
complete a 3 day course at the time of discharge.
.
5. Dispo- At the time of discharge the patient was instructed to
seek a hypercoaguable as an outpatient.  Given the patient's age
and the fact that she suffered had a MI at such a young, it was
felt that further workup was needed.  The patient was instructed
about the importance of not smoking, maintaining a healthy
lifestyle and strict adherence to her cardiac medications.
