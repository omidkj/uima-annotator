Vital Signs sheet entries for [**2186-1-5**]:
BP: 140/76. Heart Rate: 90. Weight: 195.4. Height: 70.75. BMI:
27.4. Temperature: 97.5. Resp. Rate: 16. Pain Score: 0. O2
Saturation%: 98 on 2L supplemental oxygen on nasal canula.

GENERAL: No acute distress; alert and fully oriented
CARDIAC: Regular rate and rhythm; normal S1 and S2; no
appreciable murmurs
CHEST: Incisions clean and dry; no surrounding erythema or
induration; no drainage from the wounds
PULMONARY: Mild crackles at the bilateral lung bases; some
coarse upper airway breath sounds bilaterally
ABDOMEN: Soft, non-tender, non-distended; no palpable masses
EXTREMITIES: No swelling or edema bilaterally


Pertinent Results:
Chest X-ray [**2186-1-31**]: Post-pull film following removal of right
anterior chest tube
FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**1-30**], one of the right
chest tubes appears to have been removed. No definite
pneumothorax is appreciated. Post-surgical changes persist in
the right hemithorax and there is extensive subcutaneous gas
along the right lateral chest wall.

Chest X-ray [**2186-2-1**]:
Interstitial opacities in the right lung have minimally
increased, likely due to edema. In the right upper hemithorax
several air-fluid levels are more conspicuous than in prior
studies. Right perihilar opacity is grossly unchanged, allowing
the difference in position of the patient. The left lung is
clear. The right chest tube remains in unchanged position. Right
chest wall subcutaneous emphysema has improved


Chest X-ray [**2186-2-2**]: Following 6-hour clamp trial
FINDINGS: PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient
in upright
position. Comparison is made with the next preceding similar
study obtained four hours earlier during the same day. The
previously described right-sided chest tube remains in unchanged
position. No pneumothorax has developed and there is no evidence
of significantly increased pleural densities during this
interval. The right-sided chest wall emphysema described earlier
has regressed. No new abnormalities are seen. Left-sided
hemithorax is unremarkable


Brief Hospital Course:
The patient admitted [**2186-1-27**] for Right video-assisted  thoracic
surgery (VATS)
converted to right thoracotomy and upper lobectomy, mediastinal
lymph node sampling, creation of apical pleural tent. An
epidural for pain control was placed. 2 right chest tubes were
left in place. EBL was 1600 ml and patient was transfused 2
units PRBC, started on phenylephrine and after PACU was
transferred to the TSICU. Hypotension from hypovolemia resolved
over the next 2 days, and the phenylephrine was weaned. The
patient had an episode of hemodynamically unstable rapid
supra-ventricular tachycardia vs. atrial fibrillation on POD 2
which only briefly responded to 6 of Adenosine. Another 6 of
Adenosine was given, to which the patient had another transient
response. About [**5-11**] following the 12 of Adenosine the patient
spontaneously converted to sinus rhythm and blood pressure
stabilized. She was started on metoprolol tartrate 2.5 mg IV
q6hrs to control her heart rate, and given 250cc 5% albumin for
volume expansion. She had no further acute events and was
transferred to the floor on POD 3 in good condition. Agressive
pulmonary toilet was continued. The right anterior chest tube
was pulled on POD 4. The post pull film reported a very small
pneumothorax from which the patient was asymptomatic and did
clinically warrant any intervention. The patient remained at her
baseline mild DOE with intermittent wheezes. Also on the evening
of POD 4 the patient had asymptomatic bursts of tachycardia to a
rate 140-150s after IV metoprolol had been discontinued earlier
that day. IV lopressor 5mg was given with heart rate resuming to
80's. The 12 lead EKG was obtained which was within normal
limits and troponins were negative. She was begun on oral
metoprolol 12.5mg [**Hospital1 **] and had no further cardiac events. Her
remaining chest tube (right posterior) remained on waterseal and
underwent a successful clamping trial on POD 7 ([**2186-2-2**]). Her
tube was removed and post-pull film was stable. Her epidural
catheter was also removed, with good pain control afterwards on
oral pain medications.

The patient was evaluated by the Physical Therapy service and
was able to ambulate independently and with saturations of 92%
on 2 liters of oxygen. However, given her relatively long
hospital stay and baseline supplemental oxygen requirements, the
Physical Therapy team thought it reasonable to offer her home
physical therapy services upon discharge. She was tolerating a
regular diet and her thoracotomy incision was healing well.  By
post-operative day 8 it was determined medically appropriate to
discharge the patient home. She had no further arrhythmias, her
hematocrit was stable prior to discharge, and she had remained
afebrile through-out the entirety of her hospital stay.
