History of Present Illness:
This is a 71 y/o female with h/o Aortic Stenosis w/ CHF, DMII,
Obesity who presents from OSH (admitted [**8-28**]) for evaluation of
severe aortic stenosis in setting of increasing DOE. ECHO at OSH
shows Peak grad: 67, Mean grad: 50, Aortic Valve area 0.5 cm2.
Mild to moderate MR, severe tricuspid regurg.

The patient reports increasing DOE over the last 2-3 weeks.
Prior to this time she was able to do activities of daily
living, including climbing stairs without becoming short of
breath. However, she now becomes SOB after climbing stairs and
exerting herself. She denies SOB at rest. She denies chest pain,
lightheadedness, loss of consciousness, nausea or vomiting or
palpitations. She does report increasing LE edema and subjective
weight gain over this time as well. She sleeps on 1 pillow, but
she becomes SOB when she lies flat.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 71F h/o aortic stenosis, CRI, CHF, obesity, initially w/
resp failure.

1. Respiratory Failure: Etiology of respiratory failure
multifactorial including COPD, AS/CHF, and PNA.  The patient was
treated with bronchodilators for her COPD. Levo/[**Last Name (un) **] for a 10
day course for her PNA.  And diuresed as needed for her CHF.
The patient was intubated/extubated x 3 with failure of
extubation each time.  Before the third extubation attempt, the
patient's family was presented with the option of tracheostomy
given that it was unlikely that the patient would be able to
breath on her own.  The patient's family did not think that the
pt would want this for herself.  So on HD 34 the patient fluid
status was optimized and a last attempt at extubation was made
with the idea that if she failed she would be placed on a
morphine drip and allowed to pass.  Within an hour of
extubation, the pt developed respiratory distress.  She was
placed on a morphine drip and passed comfortably several hours
later.

2.  AS (and AI, MR, TR)- Patient was transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] for
consideration of aortic valve replacement but given her
respiratory failure, this was intially put on hold and the
option of valvuloplasty was considered.  However, this too was
put on hold after a swan was placed and the patient's cardiac
index was noted to be > 3.  The patient was evaluated by both
cardiology and CT surgery.

3. DMII: On glyburide as outpatient (6mg qday- last dose 10/9).
FSBG on admission is 31--> given 1 amp D50 here. Patient was on
insulin gtt.

4. ARF - baseline Cr was 1.5. Cr while in hospital was elevated
[**12-24**].  At time of death, the patient's Cr was improving, she was
autodiuresing well and likely in the recovery phase of ATN

5. Anemia: Pt with stable Hct in 26-28 range, no signs of
bleeding.

6. Hyperlipidemia: Zocor 20mg
