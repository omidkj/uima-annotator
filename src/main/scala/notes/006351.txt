Admitted on [**2152-10-9**] and underwent MVR with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1290**].
Transferred to the CSRU in stable condition on Phenylephrine and
Propofol drips. He has some postop bleeding and went into AFib.
Experienced mild hypotension with Afib. Amiodarone and Levophed
were started. Also transfused with PRBC. He was extubated that
afternoon. Hemodynamics gradually improved. Levophed weaned off
on POD #2 and chest tubes were removed without complication.
Gentle diuresis and beta blockade were begun. Transferred to the
floor to begin increasing his activity level. Continued to
experience postop atrial fibrillation and started on Warfarin.
Transiently required intravenous Heparin for subtherapeutic INR.
Warfarin was dosed for a goal INR between 2.0 - 3.0. Over
several days, continued to make clinical improvements with
diuresis and made excellent progress with physical therapy.
Medically cleared for discharge on postoperative day seven.
Arrangements were made with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] to monitor Warfarin as
an outpatient. At discharge, his BP was 110/54 with a HR 51.
Chest x-ray showed improved atelectasis and only small bilateral
effusions. EKG at discharge showed normal sinus rhythm with
first degree AV block. All surgical wounds were clean, dry and
intact.
