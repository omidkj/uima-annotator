Coma

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation


History of Present Illness:
The pt is a 52-yo man with h/o bipolar disorder, anxiety, and
hypertension, who was found down and unresponsive at 6:45am this
morning, reportedly noted to be smelling of alcohol and known to
local police as an alcoholic. He was transported to [**Hospital1 **] via EMS and was noted to have a GCS of 3, so while en
route he received Narcan 0.4mg IV x2 without improvement.
.
On arrival to OSH, he was still completely unresponsive. He was
given another 0.2mg IV Narcan without improvement. He was
intubated for airway protection. Fingerstick blood sugar was
reportedly "fine" and EtOH level was found to be 217 [**6-10**]. He
received 1500cc NS IVF. NCHCT and C-spine CT were reportedly
negative. He was also noted to have been recently admitted to
[**Hospital3 **] on [**2149-6-6**] for EtOH intoxication. He was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further care.
.
In the ED, VS - Temp 95.6F, HR 74, BP 126/83, R 18, SaO2 100% on
AC 18x680/100%/5, with ABG 7.40/35/434. Given that he continued
to be completely unresponsive, concern was raised for possible
brainstem stroke, and neuro was consulted. They found his GCS to
be 9, moving all extremities and localizing pain, and felt that
his unresponsiveness was most likely toxic-metabolic in
etiology. Urine tox screen was also positive for
Benzodiazepines, but this was sent after receiving Midazolam for
intubation. He is being admitted to the MICU for further care.
VS prior to transfer were reportedly: BP 117/75, HR 81, R 16,
SaO2 100% on CMV 16x550/50%/5.
