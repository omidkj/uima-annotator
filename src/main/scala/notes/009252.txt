Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2763**]
Chief Complaint:
dyspnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
arterial line placement
central line placement
intubation

History of Present Illness:
85 M with history of HTN, hypercholesterolemia, PVD, lung ca s/p
right pneumonectomy presenting with increasing SOB x several
days and dry cough with fever at home.  Denies CP/palpitations.
No n/v/d.
.
On arrival to ED, initial vitals 97.2 100 106/52 20 86% and
triggered for an O2 sat of 86%.  Patient was placed on a NRB
with O2 sats up to 100%, but RR continued to rise to 30-40.
Initial CXR showed noew opacity in left base compatible with
PNA.  Started on ceftriaxone and levofloxacin for presumed PNA.
Patient was subsequently intubated for increasing respiratory
distress and elevated lactate.  Other notable labs were trop of
0.16, BNP of [**Numeric Identifier 10489**], Cr of 1.7 up from baseline of 0.8, WBC of
18.6 with left shift. EKG ST at 112 with new RBBB.  Cardiology
consulted given trop elevation and felt likely secondary to
demand ischemia and hypoperfusion, recommended treatment with
asa, but no further intervention.  After intubation, SBPs
dropped to 60s, started on peripheral levophed and left IJ CVL
was placed in ED.  On transfer to MICU, patient's most recent
vitals were BP 96/48, 99, 99% on FiO2 60%, PEEP 8 on levophed
0.15.  Given 3L NS down in ED.
.
On arrival to the MICU, patient is intubated and sedated.  Vital
signs are BP 99/58, P 117, RR 17, O2 sat 97% intubated.  No
further history is able to be obtained.
