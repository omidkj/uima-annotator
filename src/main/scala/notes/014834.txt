Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 33976**] was transferred from [**Hospital 882**] Hospital with
infrarenal aortic occlusion and bilateral lower extremity
ischemia.  She underwent urgent bilateral groin cut-down with
thrombectomy of her aorta and iliac arteries, bilateral common
iliac artery stents, and bilateral 4 compartment fasciotomies.
Post-operatively she was transferred to the CVICU where she
remained in critical condition.  She required vasopressor
support(epinephrine and neosynephrine) to maintain a normal
blood pressure and remained intubated.  She remained extremely
acidemic despite treatment with bicarbonate and fluid
resuscitation.  Her vasopressor requirement increased.  A
bedside echocardiogram was performed and demonstrated lateral
wall hypokinesis.  Dobutamine was started.  Her family was
notified of her worsening status and they elected to make her
DNR.  It was agreed between the family and the Vascular Surgery
team to increase vasopressor support as needed to provide time
for more family members to arrive but if she went into cardiac
arrest we would not resuscitate her.  Her family was with her at
the bedside when she expired at 3:52pm. They declined an
autopsy.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was promptly notified.
