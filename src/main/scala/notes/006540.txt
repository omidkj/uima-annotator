over the course of the next two to three days.  The patient
was continued on Klonopin and monitored for over sedation,
which did not occur.  It was not felt to be a pneumonia as
her chest x-ray was clear and the patient was not febrile and
her white blood cell count stabilized at 14.6.  Levaquin and
Solu-Medrol were initially begun, but discontinued as above
not felt likely to be secondary to infectious process.  The
