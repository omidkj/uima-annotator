Service:  MEDICINE INTENSIVE CARE UNIT

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Diabetic ketoacidosis.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Patient is a 33-year-old woman
with a history of insulin dependent-diabetes mellitus type 1,
complicated by gastroparesis and also history of frequent
admissions for repeated diabetic ketoacidosis and poor
compliance with medical followup presenting with nausea and
vomiting.  The patient was recently admitted for diabetic
ketoacidosis and discharged on [**2202-8-13**] from the Medicine
Intensive Care Unit.  At that time, she had also
guaiac-positive emesis.

In the Emergency Department, she was found to have initially
a fingerstick of 299.  She stated she had taken her evening
dose of Lantus which is 16 units.  In the Emergency
Department, she received 2 liters of normal saline, Lantus 20
units, Humalog insulin 10 units x1, and then was started on
an insulin drip at 5 units an hour.  She also received Zofran
and Reglan with mild improvement in her nausea.  Her second
fingerstick was 316 and then 327.  Her anion gap increased
from 16 to 25 with standing therapy with IV fluids and
insulin drip during a three hour span.

Patient was therefore, transferred to the Intensive Care Unit
for further management of her diabetic ketoacidosis.  The
patient denied any recent fever, chills, abdominal pain,
chest pain, cough, shortness of breath, diarrhea, dysuria, or
increased vaginal discharge.  She had an appointment on the
day that she presented to the Emergency Department, which she
missed because she claims she was having nausea and vomiting.

BRIEF HOSPITAL COURSE:  Patient is a 33-year-old woman with
insulin dependent diabetes complicated by gastroparesis and
multiple admissions for diabetic ketoacidosis, who presented
with nausea and vomiting, and was found to be in diabetic
ketoacidosis.

Diabetic ketoacidosis:  Upon arrival to the SICU, her
fingerstick was 67, her gap was 25, and her pH was 7.38.  Her
IV fluids were switched to D5 normal saline and after 1 liter
to D5 [**12-3**] normal saline, she required 3 liters before her gap
would close.  She was continued on the insulin drip.  After
18 hours, her gap had closed, however, she was still not able
to take any p.o. because of her underlying nausea.  She was
transferred to the floor on the insulin drip with a
requirement of q1h fingerstick and because of her requirement
for her high level of care, she was transferred back to the
Intensive Care Unit [**Unit Number **] hours after.

Her electrolytes remained within normal limits and her gap
also remained normal between 12 and 9.  She eventually became
able to tolerate p.o.  She was advanced on a solid diabetic
diet.  Her IV fluids were stopped, and she was transitioned
to regular insulin 4 units q.6h.

Myocardial infarction as a possible trigger for the event of
diabetic ketoacidosis was ruled out by cycling her cardiac
enzymes which remained negative 12 hours apart.  A urinalysis
was also checked given her history of previous UTI and was
found to be abnormal.

Urinary tract infection:  The patient was found to have a UTI
with many white blood cells and bacteria in her urine.  Urine
culture is still pending at the time of her discharge.  She
was, however, started on levofloxacin 250 mg p.o. q.d. and
will be continued for a total seven day course.

Right foot ulcer:  The patient has a chronic right foot
ulcer.  At the time of admission, the ulcer did not look
erythematous or actively draining pus.  The ulcer was treated
with wet-to-dry dressings and she will follow up with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **], who is her podiatrist.

Hypertension:  Patient was restarted on her outpatient
medications, which were documented as lisinopril and
atenolol, however, she claimed were lisinopril and Lopressor.
Occasionally, her blood pressure remained elevated in the
170-180 and she required Lopressor 5 mg IV especially given
the fact that she was probably not absorbing the p.o.

Noncompliance and recurrent admissions:  Given her history of
recent multiple admissions for diabetic ketoacidosis, the
question of poor social support, and the question was raised,
Psychiatry team was called to evaluate the patient.  They
also contact[**Name (NI) **] her mother, and they agreed that patient
probably needed more social support.  However, at this point,
she has a social worker involved in her case especially with
her [**Hospital1 **] care, and they do not find her to be
depressed.

Gastroparesis:  The patient claimed that Reglan did not help
with her gastroparesis.  I contact[**Name (NI) **] Gastroenterology
fellows, who did not have any additional suggestions and
recommended to contact Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  I have emailed Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **],
and I am waiting for his suggestions.  I will e. mail the
suggestion to the patient's primary care doctor, who is Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **].

DISPOSITION:  The patient was discharged home, where she will
restart her Lantus 20 units IV q.p.m. and Humalog sliding
scale.

FOLLOW-UP INSTRUCTIONS:  She will follow up with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 2398**]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] at the [**Last Name (un) **] and with her primary care physician, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **].
[**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1. Lantus 20 units q.p.m.
2. Humalog insulin-sliding scale.
3. Lisinopril 30 mg p.o. q.d.
4. Lopressor 25 p.o. b.i.d.
5. Levofloxacin 250 mg p.o. q.d. for four days.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  Good.
