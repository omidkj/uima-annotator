HOSPITAL COURSE:  Cardiac catheterization showed two vessel
coronary artery disease, ejection fraction by echocardiogram
was 45 to 50%.  The patient was admitted to [**Hospital6 1760**].  The patient had been
transferred from the outside hospital on Lovenox and Aspirin.
These were discontinued.  The patient continued on
intravenous Nitroglycerin infusion.  As part of the patient's
preoperative workup a urinalysis was sent which showed a
urinary tract infection.  It was also noted that the patient
was significantly anemic with hematocrit down to 25.
Hematology consult was obtained for the history of chronic
anemia.  The patient was transfused 2 units of packed red
blood cells.  Hematology Service felt that there was no
contraindication to proceeding with coronary artery bypass
[**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] the patient was taken to the Operating Room on
[**2183-12-24**] for coronary artery bypass [**Year (4 digits) **] times
three with left internal mammary artery to left anterior
descending, saphenous vein [**Year (4 digits) **] to obtuse marginal and
saphenous vein [**Year (4 digits) **] to PLV.  The patient was transported to
the Intensive Care Unit in stable condition on Propofol and
Dobutamine infusion.  The patient was weaned the next day
from mechanical ventilation on her first postoperative
evening.  The Dobutamine as weaned off over night.  On the
morning of postoperative day #1 the patient was noted to be
tachycardiac and hypertensive.  The patient was given
intravenous Lopressor and started on Nitroglycerin and a
Nitroprusside drip.  The patient progressed into atrial
fibrillation on the afternoon of postoperative day #1 which
was consistent with her preoperative rhythm.  The patient's
Lopressor dose was increased.  On postoperative day #2 the
patient began working with physical therapy.  The patient was
transferred from the Intensive Care Unit to the regular part
of the hospital.  The patient began on low dose Coumadin for
the atrial fibrillation.  On postoperative day #4, the
patient had one episode of bradycardia to the 30s which
quickly resolved back to a heart rate in the 90s to 100.  The
patient had been started on Amiodarone postoperatively.  A
cardiology consult was obtained which recommended
discontinuing the Amiodarone and using the beta blocker for
rate control and anticoagulating the patient.  The patient's
pacing wires were removed on postoperative day #5.  The
patient was restarted on Coumadin.  On postoperative day #9,
the patient's INR had risen to 2.0.  The patient's heparin
drip was discontinued and the patient remained in
rate-control fibrillation and the patient was cleared for
discharge to a rehabilitation facility on postoperative day
#10.
