History of Present Illness:
58 year old woman with past medical history of gastroesophageal
reflux with occasional episodes of postprandial pain, bleeding
hemorrhoids, colon polyp who had dental implants placed in left
posterior mandible two weeks ago which became infected and were
subsequently removed by her dentist last week. Starting Monday,
she had been having worsening pain of her left teeth,
anteriorly, and went to have her stiches taken out of the left
site. She started noticing at 7 PM that day that she was having
worsening pain and some tongue swelling. For infections, she
says that she has now been on Clindamycin 300 mg TID x 10 day
course for [**1-1**] courses since [**Month (only) **]. She endorses some mild
odynophagia, but was last able to eat pizza Monday night, and
has been drinking coffee and eating popsicles since Tuesday. She
is able to open her mouth, but finds it painful to do so.
Opening her mouth causes left anterior neck pain. However, her
symptoms of pain centered over the posterior left mandible
progressing to include odynophagia and mild voice change have
become worse. The swelling of her lower jaw started
approximately 1 week ago. Her ROS is positive for weight gain
which she attributes to dietary innatention. She has a L
perioorbital headache which she has had for several weeks on an
off, without any vision changes or blurry vision, double vision.
Her ROS is also positive for wheezing, which she attributes to
smoking.  She denies any fevers.

In the ED inital vitals were 98.3 93 150/103 100%. She received
MethylPREDNISolone Sodium Succ 125mg, Meropenem 1000 mg, and
Morphine Sulfate 8 mg. ENT evaluated and indicated that the
airway was clear, and had signed off from their perspective,
with recc's to speak to ID about abx regimen, OMFS consult, and
having a nasal trumpet by the bedside to be placed as first line
for any difficulty breathing/respiratory obstruction. OMFS has
seen as well, and has recommended that she start on IV
clindamycin, that she get Peridex Mouth wash twice a day, and to
follow-up with her periodontist.

CT Neck W/Contrast [**2139-8-25**]:
Impression:
1. Symmetric edema in the posterior floor of the mouth and base
of the tongue bilaterally, without evidence of an abscess. No
epiglottic thickening or airway narrowing. These findings are
consistent with mild Ludwig's angina.
2. Lucency at the site of the absent left mandibular first
premolar, with
disruption of the buccal cortex, which may correspond to the
site of the
recently removed implant. No evidence of edema or abscess in the
adjacent
buccal soft tissues.
3. Marrow lucency at the site of the absence left maxillary
second and third molars, without evidence of cortical
disruption.
4. Mildly enlarged left level 1A and 1B lymph nodes, likely

Portable Chest Radiograph [**2139-8-25**]:
COPD. No acute cardiopulmonary process.


Brief Hospital Course:
58 year old woman with past medical history of GERD, cleared Hep
C, Hep B, who presents with a week of mouth pain after revision
of dental implants and swelling presumed due to oral cellulitis.


1) Ludwig's Angina/Intraoral Cellulitis: The patient was
evaluated in the emergency department by ENT and Oral Surgery
who thought no acute surgical emergency.  She never had symptoms
of respiratory limitation or difficult with swallowing and ate
throughout her illness.  Imaging was without collection.
Nevertheless, given degree of swelling, reported progression,
and failure to improve on oral regimen she was treated with
meropenem and admitted to the ICU for monitoring.  She was
converted from meropenem to
ciprofloxacin/metronidazole/vancomycin and remained stable
overnight without any hemodynamic instability or fevers.  She
was called out the floor and converted to amoxicillin/clavulanic
acid.  Given history of questionable penicillin allergy (rash in
adolescence) she was observed for 24 hours on this medication
with no signs of reaction.  She was discharged home to follow up
with her periodontist  andoral-maxillofacial surgery if desired.


2) Severe Pain/ Anxiety: Despite stable to improving findings on
exam patient insistent of severe pain.  She acknowledged a great
deal of pain and fear of pain and initially required oxycodone
Q3hrs.  After hospitalist explained that this would make it
impossible for her to be discharged and after being told she
would need to use less she was eventually weaned down to Q6hrs
dosing without any indication pain had worsened.  She was
started on standing acetaminophen as well as gabapentin given
likely neuropathic component due to multiple procedures as well
as for anxiolytic component.  This seemed helpful and she was
discharged with a month supply of gabapentin and a two day
supply of oxycodone.  PCP had planned psych referral for anxiety
and further discussing this was encouraged of the patient.

3) Allergic rhinitis: This was stable, she was continued on her
home fluticasone inhaler and loratidine.

4) GERD: She was continued on her home omeprazole.

5) Presumed COPD: Pt uses albuterol QAM for wheezing at baseline
but given long history of smoking seems likely this is due to
COPD, in which anticholinergic ipratroprium would be p
