Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Codeine / Zocor

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1899**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath, evaluation for CABG

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
PICC line placement
Cardiac catheterization with drug eluting stent to the left
anterior descending artery.


History of Present Illness:
79 yo F with multiple medical conditions including HTN, DMII,
HLD, PVD, carotid disease, mitral valve prolapse with trace MR,
CKD, gout, RA, history of thrombocytopenia, likely ITP,
rhabdomyolysis, diverticulosis of the urinary bladder, atrophic
right kidney, fatty liver, who was originally admitted to [**Hospital 40796**] on [**2107-1-1**] for fall and shortness of breath, now
transferred for evaluation for CABG.
.
Patient presented to OSH after unintentional fall that resulted
in right foot bruising. No history of seizure or pre-syncope. In
the weeks leading up to her admission, she had noticed
increasing SOB, productive cough with sputum production,
increased LE edema, and unintentional weight pain.
.
During her OSH hospital course she was treated emphirically for
pneumonia and aggresively diuresed for CHF exacerbation. X-ray
ruled out fracture of the right foot. EKG showed anterolateral
ST depressions and elevated cardiac biomarkers, CK
142->135->124, CK-MB 7->6->7.1, Trop-I 0.47->0.4->2.52. Echo
cardiogram showed 2+ TR, 2+ MR, 1+ PI and borderline pulmonary
hypertension. She was evaluated by cardiology consult and a
catheterization was performed which showed 2-vessel disease
including 80% stenosis of the proximal LAD. The plan was to
pursue CABG at [**Hospital1 18**]. Prior to transfer, patient developed acute
on chronic renal failure with Cr up to 2.1. Today she also
developed acute dyspnea requiring BiPap (flashed), 120 mg of IV
lasix with good urine output.
.
On transfer, she had O2 sat of 91-93% on 3L NC, CXR negative,
and BP of 140/42. She did not have any chest pain but her
Troponin was up to 2.52. On arrival, patient was comfortable and
denied any SOB or chest pain. Vital signs were 97.3, 75, 130/47,
24, 93% (3L).
.
On review of systems, she denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, hemoptysis, black stools
or red stools. She denies recent fevers, chills or rigors. She
denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other review
of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, palpitations.

CT CHEST W/O CONTRAST:
.
IMPRESSION:
1. Normal size and caliber of aorta on this non-contrast
examination.
Coronary artery and aortic calcifications.
2. Bilateral pleural effusions and atelectasis. Additional
bilateral foci of ground-glass nodular opacities more have an
appearance of infection than pulmonary edema.
3. Nodular liver contour suggestive of cirrhosis.
4. Persistent contrast within the kidneys from prior
catheterization suggests possible nephropathy depending on the
time since last contrast.
.
CAROTID U/S:
IMPRESSION:
1. Less than 40% stenosis of the right internal carotid artery.
2. 40-59% stenosis of the left internal carotid artery.
3. To and fro flow in the right vertebral artery may be a sign
of proximal
subclavian artery stenosis.
.
ECHO:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There is mild regional
left ventricular systolic dysfunction with focal basal inferior
hypokinesis. The remaining segments contract normally (LVEF =
50-55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but
aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no
mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is
no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction,
c/w CAD. Mild mitral regurgitation. Mild pulmonary hypertension.

.
CARDIAC CATH [**1-12**]:
PTCA COMMENTS:     Angiography from the outside hospital was
reviewed.
We elected not to reshoot the RCA. Under ultrasound guidance the
left
femoral artery and left femoral vein were canulated. A 6Fr
sheath was
placed in the artery and a 5Fr was placed in the vein. We
advanced a 6Fr
XBLAD3.5 guiding catheter. It provided good support. We wired
with a CPT
XS wire and advanced a 2.5x12mm apex balloon, which was
predilated to 6
atm. We then deployed a 2.5x12mm Promus DES across the lesion.
We post
dilated with a 3.0x8mm NC quantum balloon. Final angiography
revealed
the Cx ostium to be preserved, no evidence of dissection, and
TIMI 3
flow through the stent in the LAD. At the end of the case a 6Fr
Angioseal closure device was deployed without complication.
.
COMMENTS:
1. Successful PCI to ostial LAD lesion with DES.
2. Aspirin and plavix for 12 months minimum.
3. Transfer back to CCU for further monitoring.
.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. One vessel coronary artery disease.
.
LEFT GROIN U/S [**2107-1-15**]:
FINDINGS: Grayscale and Doppler ultrasound was performed on the
left groin.  There is turbulent flow within the left common
femoral
