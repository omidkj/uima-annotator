Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3021**]
Chief Complaint:
Elective admission for decitabine cycle #1 for MDS.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None.

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 7597**] is a 64 year old gentleman with a PMH of MS, and a
recent diagnosis of myelodysplastic syndrome, now being admitted
electively for decitabine(15mg/m2 Q8 x3 days), cycle one.  He
was diagnosed with MS in [**2154**], and felt that his MS symptoms of
fatigue were progressing in the fall of [**2170**], at which point he
was found to have progressive LE edema and a new systolic murmur
at his [**Year (4 digits) 3390**]'s.  Labs at that time showed pancytopenia, ARF and
transaminitis.  He was admitted to the hospital from [**Date range (1) 7599**],
with anemia and UTI.  After transfusion of 9 units PRBCs and 6
units of platelets, patient developed volume overload and
high-output heart failure (EF>55%), and susequent respiratory,
requiring ICU admission, intubation and aggressive diuresis.
Patient also received empiric antibioitcs for HCAP.  ICU course
also complciated by slow lower GIB, and partially occlusive L
tibial DVT.  Bone marrow biopsy during that admission showed
hypercellular marrow with extensive fibrosis, trinlineage
dysplasia, and increased myeloblasts.  12% Findings highly
suspicious for a myelodysplastic disorder best classified as
refractory anemia with excess blasts (RAEB-2) based on the # of
myeloblasts in the peripheral blood. Peripheral blood w/
deletion 7q, and 5q.
.
Since his last admission, the patient has been improving at
rehab (at [**Hospital1 **]).  He continues to have dyspnea on exertion,
but this is stable.  He also continues to have neuropathic pain,
related to his MS, which includes burning dysethesias, painful
vibratory sensations and spasticity.  These symptoms improve
with lorazepam.  In the past, his symptoms had been
well-controlled with copaxoen, which was discontinued at the
time of his MDS diagnosis.  Additionally, patient notes
significant anxiety, especially surrounding his MS symptoms.  He
has been taking lorazepam consistently on a q3-4 hour basis.
.
On arrival to the floor, the patient was comfortable and
optimistic regarding the initiation of treatment.
.
Review of systems:
Positive as noted in the HPI.  Also positive for chronic
constipation with intermittent hematochezia.
Negative for fevers, chills, weight loss/gain, chest pain,
shortness of breath at rest, abdominal pain, dysuria, hematuria.
 Otherwise negative.

Past Medical History:
- Multiple Sclerosis - Diagnosed in [**2154**]. Multiple resolving
flares. Multiple lesions detected on [**Year (4 digits) 4338**]. Has been treated with
alternative medications and acupuncture after having a bad
experience with amantadine.
- Osteoporosis
- Vitamin D deficiency
- MDS, dx [**12/2170**]

Social History:
Patient coming in from [**Hospital3 **] now.  Previously lived
alone and has since college.  No current alcohol.  Quit smoking
~20 years ago.  Continues to smoke marijuana occasionally for
spasticity.  No other illicit drug use.

.
[**2171-1-30**] CXR: IMPRESSION: Cardiac size is normal. Right PICC tip
is in the lower SVC. The left lung is clear. Right lower lobe
opacity is the combination of moderate-to-large right pleural
effusion with adjacent atelectasis, underlying infectious
process cannot be excluded. There are no new lung abnormalities.
.
[**2171-1-31**] CXR: IMPRESSION:
1. New opacification at the left base may represent early
pneumonia or atelectasis. Would recommend short term follow up
with subsequent radiographs.
2. Slight decrease in size of moderate right pleural effusion.
3. Persistent consolidation in the right base is likely
atelectasis, although pneumonia cannot be excluded.
.
[**2171-2-5**] CXR: FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph,
there is no relevant change. Relatively extensive and probably
loculated right pleural effusion.  Subsequent areas of right
atelectasis. The left lung is unremarkable.  Unchanged size of
the cardiac silhouette. Unchanged course of the right PICC line.

Brief Hospital Course:
64yo man with MS and recently diagnosed MDS RAEB-2 admitted for
cycle #1 decitabine.  Course complicated by hypoxia and
hypotension.  CXR showed RLL and LLL infiltrate.  Transferred to
ICU for hypotension, which resolved with IV fluids.  Vancomycin,
cefepime, and metronidazole started.  Diarrhea resolved, C. diff
negative.
.
# MDS/pancytopenia: Started cycle #1 decitabine [**2171-1-29**], but
interrupted [**2171-1-31**] due to hypoxia/hypotension/ICU transfer.
Restarted [**2171-2-3**] and finished [**2171-2-4**].  Transfused 1U pRBC
[**2171-2-1**], [**2171-2-6**], [**2171-2-7**], and [**2171-2-8**].  Low retic index.
Transfused PLTs [**2171-2-8**].  Continued TMP-SMX and acyclovir
prophylaxis.  Continued allopurinol for hyperuricemia.
.
# Hypoxia: Likely due to recurrent aspiration pneumonia +
right-sided pleural effusion considering hypoxia, fever to 102F
[**2171-1-31**], tachypnea (RR 30), hypotension, and CXR findings.  BNP
3543 on [**2170-12-13**].  Echo [**2170-12-14**] showed LVEF >55%, moderate MR,
and mild pulmonary HTN.  He refused a repeat video swallow
having had one last week as an outpatient.  He was explained the
risks of aspiration incl
