Chief Complaint:
Cramping of both hands.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None.

History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 43-year-old female with a history of hepatitis
C, alcohol abuse, and hypokalemia with multiple past admissions
for nausea,
vomiting, diarrhea, and hypokalemia who was admitted for severe
electrolyte disturbances.  The patient states that she felt some
cramping in her hands and legs while gardening.  She initially
felt a pins and needles sensation that progressed to spasms,
particularly in both of her hands.  She became concerned and
came to the ED for evaluation.

In the Emergency Department, laboratories revealed a sodium of
119, chloride of 63, potassium level of 2.0, and a magnesium
level of 0.6.  While in
the Emergency Department she received 40 mEq (6:30 am) and 60
mEq ([**2179**]) of potassium chloride orally and 40 mEq intravenously
with normal saline.  She also received5 grams of magnesium
sulfate intravenously along with a "bananna bag."

She was admitted to the ICU and hydrated with normal saline. She
also underwent aggressive repletion of potassium and magnesium.

Past Medical History:
1.  Hepatitis C with undetectable viral load.
 2.  Endometrial hyperplasia; status post total abdominal
hysterectomy in [**2170**].

 4.  History of a liver lesion.
 5.  Osteopenia.
 6.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
 7.  Gastroesophageal reflux disease.

 9.  History of hypokalemia attributed intermittently to
alcohol, gastritis, poor oral intake - resulting in multiple
admissions.

11.  Depression.
12.  Chronic intermittent diarrhea.
13.  Chronic lower extremity neuropathic pain.
14.  History of pneumothorax requiring a chest tube in [**2158**].
15.  Possible history of purging behavior with a history of
self-induced vomiting.


Social History:
The patient is married and lives with her
husband.  She has a grown son who still lives in the
household.  She is unemployed.  She reports drinking three to
four 8-ounce size drinks nightly, drinking five nights out of

use.  She denies any use of laxatives, diuretics, or any
other medications to assist with purging.

Brief Hospital Course:
1.Hyponatremia: It was felt on admission that the patient likely
suffered from a hypotonic hypovolemic hyponatremia secondary to
GI losses.  It was also thought that she may have a degree of
"beer-drinking hyponatremia."  In any event, she was hydrated
with intravenous normal saline.  Over the course of her
hospitalization, her serum sodium began to normalize (119 on
admission to 125 to 130-132) with progressive hydration.  Her
serum sodium was 132 on discharge.

2.Hypokalemia: Again, the etiology of her hypokalemia was
uncertain.  She does, however, have a past history significant
for chronic diarrhea which is likely a contributing factor,
although not the main cause.  The pt. has had an extensive
workup including GI and renal consults in the past. The
patient's presenting symptom of muscle cramping was most likely
a result of this electrolyte disturbance.  Her potassium
normalized with aggressive intravenous then oral supplementation
(2.5 on admission to 3.5-4.0 on subsequent evaluation).  Her
serum potassium was 3.9 on discharge.

3.Hypocalcemia: She was given calcium gluconate for repletion.
Her serum calcium was 5.2 on admission and subsequently remained
in the 6.5-7.0 range.  Of note, the patient's serum albumin was
4.4 on admission.  Therefore, the calcium values can be regarded
as accurate, not requiring correction for hypoalbuminemia.

4.Hypomagnesemia:  Again, the etiology of hypomagnesemia in this
patient is not entirely clear.  Possible etiologies include GI
losses or alcohol-induced renal tubular dysfunction.  Her serum
magnesium was 0.6 on admission and following repletion with
intravenous magnesium sulfate, her serum magnesium was 3.3 by
the time of discharge.

5.Increased CK:  This was felt to be likely due to a small
degree of muscle breakdown secondary to the cramping that the
patient was experiencing prior to admisssion.  Her cardiac
enzymes were cycled nevertheless and she did rule out for MI on
this basis.

6.ETOH abuse: This is a continued problem with this patient and
has been the culprit of her multiple hospital admissions.
Rehabilitation was discussed with the patient who stated that
she would give this idea serious consideration.  During her
hospitalization, she was maintained on folate, thiamine and
received B12 supplementation.  She was on CIWA scale with prn
benzodiazipines ordered, but at no time did the patient appear
to have withdrawal symtoms.
