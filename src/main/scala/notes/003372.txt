Brief Hospital Course:
A/P 77 y/o M w/ hx of CHF and htn, who presented to OSH after
fall from standing. Unclear if fall due to trip and fall or
other cause, as pt has no recollection of event. At OSH pt was
found to have subdural hematoma and was transferred to the [**Hospital1 **]
for further management.

On admission pt was sent to the MICU. Neurosurgery and spine
consults were obtained for recommendations regarding the
patients subdural hematoma and L1/L5 compression fractures.  The
patient remained in a ccollar and on logroll precautions until
such time that spine service cleared the cspine and provided a
TLSO brace for getting out of bed.  Neurosurgery followed until
the subdural was proven stable.  The medical service also worked
the patient up for possible causes of syncope, none which were
proven.  Not long into the patient's stay he aspirated chicken
and rice subsequently developing pneumonia requiring intubation.
 His respiratory condition worsened to ARDS.  He was empirically
treated with vanc, zosyn, levoflox although no clear
microorganism grew from his sputum even with good sputum samples
obtained with bronchoscopy.  Pt also developed septic shock
requiring pressors to maintain blood pressure.  Meanwhile, it
was noted that the patient had a R elbow laceration with leaking
bursa.  The ortho service noted that the wound was not infected
and could be adequately managed with wet to dry dressings.
Also, while on the MICU service the patient suffered from anemia
and thrombocytopenia as well as mild adrenal insufficiency.  Pt
was given steroi
