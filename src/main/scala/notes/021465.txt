[**8-12**] PMIBI:
INTERPRETATION:
Left ventricular cavity size is moderately enlarged.
Rest and stress perfusion images reveal a moderate fixed
inferolateral wall perfusion defect and a moderate fixed apical
wall perfusion defect.
Gated images reveal global hypokinesis.
The calculated left ventricular ejection fraction is 36%.
Compared with the study of [**2104-2-20**], there are no changes in
the perfusion defects seen. However, cavity size is enlarged
with reduced function compared to prior study.
IMPRESSION: 1. Moderate fixed inferolateral wall and a moderate
fixed apical wall perfusion defect. No significant change from
prior study. 2. There has been an increase in dilatation of left
ventricle with global hypokinesis and reduced function. (EF=
36%).
.
[**8-12**] Stress 61% of HR:
INTERPRETATION: This 77 yo woman with CHF and Afib was referred
for
evaluation of CAD and shortness of breath. Patient presented
with
difficulty breathing that has been bothering her for about a
week. Lungs were clear to auscultation pre-procedure. The
patient was infused with 0.142mg/kg/min of Persantine over 4
minutes. No neck, back, arm or chest discomfort was reported
during the procedure. No significant ST segment changes were
noted in the presence of baseline ST-T wave abnormalities. The
rhythm was atrial fibrillation with occasional isolated
multifocal VPDs and one V.couplet in recovery. Hemodynamic
response to infusion was appropriate. 2 minutes post-MIBI
injection, the patient was given 125mg of IV aminophylline.
Patient's SaO2 post-procedure was 85%. Following administration
of 4L of O2 NC, SaO2 improved to 97%.
IMPRESSION: No anginal type symptoms or ischemic EKG changes.
Nuclear
report sent separately.

[**2107-8-14**] CT Chest:
CT CHEST WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: There has been interval increase
in size of the right-sided pleural effusion which now is
moderate to large in size. There is also new extension of
effusion along the right horizontal fissure. There is new mild
pericardial effusion. The left lung is unremarkable with no
evidence of effusion. There is a small stable ground glass
nodular density within the right middle lobe measuring 7 mm.
There is no hilar lymphadenopathy. Within the mediastinum, there
is an enlarged lymph node measuring 13 mm along the pretracheal
nodal chain seen best on series 2, image 17. There is no hilar
lymphadenopathy. The heart is markedly enlarged as demonstrated
previously. The main pulmonary arteries are enlarged.  There is
a 2.6-cm right mid-pole simple renal cyst and a 3.9-cm left
mid-pole simple renal cyst.
IMPRESSION:
1. Increase in size of right pleural effusion, now moderate to
large.
2. New mild pericardial effusion.
3. No evidence of pneumonia.
4. Stable cardiomegaly.
5. Bilateral simple renal cysts.
6. Single nonspecific enlarged 13 mm mediastinal lymph node.
.
[**2107-8-22**] CT CHEST WITH AND WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: There has been
interval decrease in the right effusion, which is small to
moderate in size. The anteromedial and posteromedial components
are loculated and there layering high attenuation material in
the posteromedial component. There are no enhancing pleural
nodules or masses. There is impaction of a right upper lobe
segmental bronchus, and there is layering fluid in the right and
left main bronchi. There is peribronchiolar nodular density in
the right upper lobe, not visualized on the previous study.
There is a 6 mm subpleural right upper lobe nodular density (5,
18), not definitely visualized on the previous study. Band- like
linear density in the right middle and right lower lobe is
compatible with atelectasis.  There is a borderline enlarged
right pretracheal lymph node, now measuring 10 mm in short axis.
There are no enlarged hilar or axillary lymph nodes. The
thoracic aortic caliber is normal, with mild calcification.
There is global cardiomegaly, to the greatest degree involving
the left atrium. There is no pericardial effusion.  ABDOMEN:
There are two left renal cortical hypodensities and one right
renal cortical hypodensity, measuring up to 4.3 cm in the left
upper renal cortex. one of which is too small to characterize in
the left interpolar region and the others of which are
compatible with cysts. Gallstones are noted.  OSSEOUS
STRUCTURES: There are no findings suspicious for malignancy.
There is mild dextroconvex thoracic scoliosis with moderate
endplate osteophytes.
IMPRESSION:  1. Small-to-moderate, partially loculated right
pleural effusion with a small amount of layering hemorrhage
posteromedially in lower right chest.  2. Right upper lobe
peribronchiolar nodules, compatible with aspiration or
infection. Minimal layering fluid in the bronchi may suggest
aspiration over infection.  3. Right upper lobe nodule is likely
inflammatory in nature. However, a followup CT is recommended in
