Chest PA and lateral on [**2192-5-7**].
FINDINGS: In the interim, the left chest drainage catheter has
been removed with no evidence of pneumothorax. Slight expansion
of the left lung is noted. Persistent blunting of the left
costophrenic angle and persistent elevation of the left
hemidiaphragm could be attributed to left basilar minimal
atelectasis. Post-surgical changes in the left thoracic inlet
region characterized by the presence of resection of first and
second ribs and post-surgical changes are noted. The right lung
is clear. The midline sternal sutures appear well aligned with
the exception of one of the most inferior suture, which is more
vertically oriented and slightly off the midline to the left
side.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was admitted on [**2192-4-27**] and underwent successful Left
hemi-clam shell (sternotomy plus fifth interspace left anterior
thoracotomy), resection of left
Pancoast tumor (left upper lobectomy plus chest wall resections
of ribs one and two), mediastinal lymph node dissection,
flexible bronchoscopy. He was transfer to the SICU intubated in
stable condition. He had [**Known firstname **] apical chest-tube, basilar [**Doctor Last Name **]
drain, a foley and Dilaudid PCA for pain control. His left upper
extremity neuro/vascular exam was monitor closely. On POD #1 he
was extubated and good pulmonary toileting was continued.  On
POD #2 the NG tube was removed, he transferred to the floor,
chest tubes were placed to water-seal. He was followed by serial
CXRs. He was started on a clear liquid diet.  On POD #3 the
chest-tube had a high output suspicious for a left chylothorax
leak. Pleural triglycerides were positive. He was continued on a
clear liquid diet and started on IV fluids. On  POD #4 he was
seen by physical and occupational therapy who felt he did not
warrant further treatment.  On POD #5 Right VAT thoracic duct
ligation and flexible bronchoscopy. On POD #6 he had repeat
flexible bronchoscopy which showed subglottic mucosal erythema,
LUL stump intact, and thick green secretions. A sputum specimen
was sent and grew GRAM NEGATIVE DIPLOCOCCI. He was started on
Ciprofloxacin for possible pneumonia. The foley was removed and
he voided without difficulty.  He was restarted on a clear
liquid diet. His chest-tube output diminished.  On POD #7 his
right [**Doctor Last Name **] drain was removed and his diet was advanced.  On POD
#8 the left chest-tube was removed the [**Doctor Last Name **] was placed to bulb
suction.  His Dilaudid PCA was converted to PO pain medication
with good control. On POD #9 the [**Doctor Last Name **] drain was removed.  His
CXR revealed no pneumothorax.  He continued to make steady
progress and was discharged to home.  He will follow-up with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] as [**Known firstname **] outpatient.
