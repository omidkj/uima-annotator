Brief Hospital Course:
Patient was admitted to the thoracic surgery team and started on
aggressive iv fluid for rehydration. He was also started on
zosyn and vancomycin for a presumed cellulitis around his [**Doctor Last Name **]
drain. A CXR was performed which demonstrated an increased right
pleural effusion as well as a chest CT which demonstrated a new
right hydropneumothorax. The patient's chest tube was placed to
suction.
HD #1-patient remained afebrile, continued rehydration with ivf.

HD#2-Overnight transfused 1U PRBC's for Hct 21.2.
HD#3-Patient noted to have elevated WBC, and brown fluid
draining from [**Doctor Last Name **] drain. In am, decreasing O2 saturations
(80's) as well as crackles on pulmonary exam. Patient given iv
lasix and transferred to ICU with presumed congestive heart
failure and pulmonary edema. He remained on a nonrebreather and
then bipap with adequate O2 saturations. An ECHO performed
revealed EF of 35%. A CT guided pigtail was placed in his R
chest in order to drain the new fluid noted in the right chest.
Very litte drainage noted from pigtail drain after placement.
HD#4-Continued diuresis using iv lasix. Possibility of
intubation discussed with patient and his daughter. [**Name (NI) **] made
DNR/DNI per his wishes. Respiratory status slowly improved,
patient off bipap. Cardiology consulted regarding patients
deteriorating cardiac status compared to his previous
echocardiogram from [**2191-10-6**]. They recommended continued diuresis
and supportive care.
HD#5-Pleural fluid sent for culture +MRSA. Patient continued on
vancomycin and zosyn.
HD#[**5-10**]-Patient improved clinically, WBC trending down to 11.7.
Patient transferred to floor.
HD#8-Purulent drainage noted from pigtail catheter, sent for
culture and gram stain once more, still +MRSA despite vancomycin
treatment.
HD#9-both chest tube and pigtail to water seal with minimal
drainage and a +air leak. Zosyn discontinued due to culture
results. Patient improving, tolerating po's.
HD#10-afebrile, out of bed walking, improving. Chest CT
performed demonstrates improved right parenchymal opacification
with persistence in RML/RLL. Anterior hydropneumo improved
slightly.
HD#11-patient afebrile, normal WBC. PICC line placed for 2 week
course of vancomycin. Chest tube placed to bulb suction.
HD#12-Patient discharged to rehab in stable condition with chest
tube to bulb suction and pigtail drain to pleurovac. He was
instructed to follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in one week.
