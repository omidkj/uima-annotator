Radiology:

[**9-9**] CT chest/abdomen/pelvis:
- No pulmonary embolism identified.
- Atelectasis and/or consolidation seen in the superior segment
of the right lower lobe. Atelectasis is noted in the right
middle lobe and left lower lobe.
- No focal fluid collections are seen.
- Enhancing inflammatory tissue at the site of the patient's
known wound infection which involves the abdominal wall fascia
and musculature extending from the subcutaneous soft tissues and
minimally into the intra-abdominal space.  No involvement with
intra-abdominal organs.
- Aneurysmal dilatation of the thoracoabdominal aorta
- Sigmoid diverticulosis without diverticulitis.
- Mild common duct and intrahepatic dilatation.

[**9-15**] CXR: Worsening opacities in the lingula and left lower
lobe, suspicious for aspiration or aspiration pneumonia.

[**9-16**] CXR: No pneumothorax. Bilateral pleural effusions with
bibasilar
infiltration.

[**9-17**] CXR: There is no pneumothorax. The patient is status post
median sternotomy. Again noted are small bilateral pleural
effusion with patchy increased opacity at the lung bases.
Feeding tube tip terminates in the proximal stomach and is too
high to be used for feeding. This is also unchanged compared to
the prior film.

[**9-21**] CXR: No interval change from previous exam

[**9-20**] Shoulder X-ray: There are marked degenerative of the
glenohumeral joint, with
marked joint space narrowing, subchondral sclerosis and large
osteophytes. There is slight superior subluxation of the humeral
head. AC joint shows mild degenerative changes. I doubt the
presence of glenohumeral dislocation, but the absence of an
axillary or Y view cannot entirely exclude it.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] was initally admitted to [**Hospital Ward Name 121**] 5. She was started on
Levofloxacin and Vancomycin for her wound infection. Per report,
on hospital day #2, her blood pressure began to drop and her
respiratory status deteriorated, with decreasing oxygen
saturation. The patient was transferred to the SICU for close
hemodynamic monitoring and pressure support in a setting of
likely sepsis. Her hospital course will be reviewed by problems.


1) Cardiovascular: As per report, in the SICU, she was started
on norepinephrine to maintain her blood pressure. On [**2191-9-11**], a
vasopressin drip was added for pressure support. Levophed was
weaned off on [**2191-9-12**], while vasopressin was stopped on
[**2191-9-13**]. However, her blood pressure remained low (SBP in 80s)
and an ACTH stmulation test was performed on [**2191-9-14**]. Cortisol
failed to rise appropriately (12.4 to 15.5), and Hydrocortisone
was started for probable adrenal insufficiency, with a notable
improvement in her blood pressure the following day.

She was transferred to the medicine floor on [**2191-9-16**]. Her blood
pressure remained fairly stable while on the floor, with
occasional boluses given. At discharge, her SBP is in 120s and
DBP in 70s-80s. Steroids were slowly tapered, from
Hydrocortisone to Prednisone 10 mg PO daily on [**2191-9-15**],
decreased to 5 mg daily on [**2191-9-22**]. She should be tapered off
steroids in 4 days.

Of note, while in the SICU, whe was noted to have occasional
PVCs and PACs. No other rhythm disturbances were noted.

2) Respiratory: In the SICU, Ms. [**Known lastname **] was initially on
non-rebreather with adequate oxygenation but CO2 retention. Poor
management of oral secretions was noted. She was intubated for
airway protection and progressive hypercarbic respiratory
failure (pCO2 79). The ventilatory settings were adjusted with a
higher target PCO2 in this known CO2 retainer.

A CTA was performed on [**2191-9-9**] which was negative for pulmonary
embolism. She was extubated on [**2191-9-12**] and placed on a shovel
mask, then nasal cannula. However, on [**9-15**], she had persistent
respiratory acidosis with hypercarbia (ABG 7.26/87/146 on 4L
N/C) and she was transferred to the MICU for further management
of her respiratory issues.

In the MICU, a CXR was suspicious for aspiration pneumonia in
this patient with impaired mental status and history of failed
swallowing assessment on [**2191-9-13**] (see below). Levofloxacin and
Flagyl were started. Repeat CXRs in the ensuying days revealed
persistent small bilateral pleural effusions and fairly stable
patchy bibasilar infiltrates.

While on the medicine floor, she was stable from a respiratory
standpoint. Her oxygen requirements declined from 4 L/min to
2L/min on the day of discharge, with a goal oxygen saturation of
89-92 %. She remains on Flagyl and Levofloxacin for the
treatment of her aspiration pneumonia, to be completed on
[**2191-9-25**] (total 10 days of antibiotherapy).

3) MRSA wound infection: The wound was opened on admission and
allowed to heal by secondary intention. Ms. [**Known lastname **] was initially
started on Levofloxacin and Vancomycin on [**2191-9-7**]. Levofloxacin
was changed to Zosyn on [**2191-9-9**]. A wound culture eventually
grew MRSA, and Zosyn was stopped. She ha
