to have a BDIMC outpt liver transplant evaluation on [**2130-3-16**].
She was admitted from a [**Hospital1 1501**] to AJH on [**2130-1-24**] w/ worsening
ascites, abnormal LFTs including increased ammonia level (61 on
[**1-21**] to 129) and ARF. She was admitted w/ a WBC of 22, Cr of 3.1
(baseline 1.2). Given concern for SBP, she was tapped and 3.5L
fluid were removed but no cultures were sent. She was started on
Unasyn IV but developed desquamation of her soles on [**2-1**] so it
was stopped and steroid cream was used to treat the rash. Renal
consult diagnosed her w/ hepatorenal and started her on
midodrine 10mg po tid and octreotide 100mcg SQ tid. The patient
was retapped [**2-2**] and cultures are pending, gram stain negative,
WBC 280 with 29% neut.. Per OSH transfer note one out of four
bottles BCx grew noncandidal yeast (however micro lab now says
no yeast in cultures) and she was started on caspofungin IV. GI
consult felt she was recovering from severe alcoholic hepatitis
but recommended no specific therapy other than abstinence from
EtOH, diet, and vitamins.
.
During her hospitalization her INR was noted to be rising,
reaching 2.6 on [**2-2**]. Her WBC [**2-3**] was 26.4 (88.5% and 15
bands), an increase from 16 over the past few days. Her renal
function improved gradually w/ creatinine 1.6 today from 3.1.
.
On speaking with her husband, he states there is no way she
could have received alcohol within the last week and that she
has been sober for about 2 months. Besides her family, a couple
of family friends have visited her in the hospital and [**Hospital1 1501**].  She
is currently unable to answer questions.  On the floor she was
very agitated, she received 6mg Haldol and was placed in
restraints.  An NG tube was placed and labs sent.  Based upon
her labs MICU was called to evaluate.
