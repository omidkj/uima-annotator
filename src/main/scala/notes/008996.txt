History of Present Illness:
Ms [**Last Name (Titles) **]. [**Doctor Last Name **] is a  65 year old woman with signficant PMH of
atrial fibrillation on Coumadin, lung cancer s/p resection [**2109**],
congestive heart failure, diabetes, and hypertension who
presents with worsening diarrhea and dysuria who was found to be
hypotensive in the ED and admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for presumed
sepsis.

She was recently hospitalized at [**Hospital1 2025**] in their ICU for diarrhea
and dyhydration.  Blood cx were negative, c.diff x3 negative,
and had a pansensitive e.coli UTI treated with ceftriaxone
x7days.  Discharge to rehab was recommended, but she declined
and came home last Monday. Since arriving home, patient has had
persistent diarrhea, up to 10 "mushy stools" per day and reports
persistent dysuria and feeling of incomplete voiding. She
visited her PCP today where she also complained of dysphagia to
solids and pills (s/p normal swallow study at [**Hospital1 2025**]) resulting in
poor po intake. She also reported a fall at home several days
ago resulting in increased back pain. She then presented to the
ED for further evaluation. Denies any fevers, chills, N/V,
abdominal pain, melena, hematochezia.

In the ED, initial VS were T 98.6 P 83 BP 81/47 RR 24 O296%. CVL
was placed and patient received 2LNS prior to initiation of
levophed with good effect. Blood, urine, and stool cultures were
sent and patient was started flagyl, vanco, cefepime for
presumed urosepsis and CDiff. NCHCT was unremarkable and CT
torso showed stable verterbral compression fx and acute
posterior rib fx. Additionally, there was concern for early PNA
and diverticulitis. She was admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for further
management.

On arrival to the MICU, patient was alert and interactive, she
had no complaints except some mild SOB and malaise.

Active Issues
====================
# Sepsis: Hypotensive with pronounced leukocytosis and multiple
potential sources for infection, including: UTI, PNA, CDiff, and
diverticulitis. CT scan was concerning for colitis, no
peritoneal fluids or free fluid in the abdomen. She was started
on vancomycin/meropenem/flagyl for diverticulitis.  Surgery was
consulted and agreed with antibiotic regimen.  No need for
surgery.  With positive, C.diff PCR, failed flagyl as
outpatient, and recent abx use, she was placed on po vancomycin.
She was fluid resuscitated and transiently required pressors.
Her WBC stabalzied while on the floor, ID was consulted and her
antibiotics were narrowed to cefepime IV and po vanco and
flagyl.  She will be sent on po vanco indefinately and ID will
assist with tapering in the future on follow up arranged for
[**2112-7-26**] with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) **].
.
# RML PNA in the setting of dysphagia
The patient was intially treated with vancomycin/meropenum in
the ICU.  Give the patient multiple comorbidities including lung
cancer and findings on CT, we chose to treat the patient with
cefepime for a health care associate PNA.  She completed the
course of therapy with cefepime and flagyl as per ID team recs
prior to discharge from the hosptial.  The patient also was
evaluated by the speech and swallow service and passed the exam
(normal)
.
# Normocytic anemia
Patients baseline appears to be between [**10-22**] but more recently
in the last 6 months it's [**7-21**].  The patients hemoglobin
continued to decrease in house and an anemia work up revealed
iron deficiency.  Outpatient follow up with GI and PCP arranged
for consideration of iron supplementation and colonoscopy.
Colonoscopy and endoscopy at [**Location (un) 2274**] from [**2109**] reviewed.  EGD with
gastritis.  Colonoscopy was normal.  PPI held for the time being
given active c difficile infection.  Pt did not complain of any
gastritic symptoms during this hospitalization.
.
# s/p Fall:
Likely mechanical due to deconditioning from multiple recent
hospital stays + concurrent illness. No apparent LOC or
headstrike. Non contrast heat CT was negative.  CT of
abdomen/pelvis showed new, acute right 7th and 8th rib
fractures.
New compression fracture of the T8 vertebral body and interval
worsening of compression fracture of the T9 vertebral body.
Neurosurgery was consulted and recommended no brace and
Ca/Vitamin D with appropriate risk scanning of DEXA.
.
#  Liver cirrhosis
CT from this admission showed cirrhosis.  HAV/HBV and HCV
serologies were checked and were normal.  O/P follow up with GI
arranged.
.
# dCHF:
Primarily diastolic with LVEF >55% on TTE in [**Month (only) 547**]. Also with
mild AS. Home regimen includes enalapril, metoprolol, digoxin,
ASA, and torsemide. Enalapril, metoprolol, and torsemide were
held given sepsis as above, then resumed prior to discharge.
.
# Afib:
On coumadin at home, INR therapeutic when admitted. Continued on
home dose of digoxin.  Metoprolol was held given her
hypotension.  Medications resumde prior to d/c. Warfarin dose
down adjusted slightly to 3 mg daily.  Recommended home INR
check in 48 hours, and alerted the coumadin clinic to this
change and recommendation for ongoing monitoring at home, next
