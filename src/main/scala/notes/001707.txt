HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient was seen by Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] on [**2168-9-15**] presenting with an incisional
hernia secondary to abdominal surgery for a splenic artery
aneurysm in [**Month (only) 404**].  The hernia at that time was
asymptomatic on examination of the patient.  He was generally
healthy and thin.  He had two areas of herniation in the
midline incision; one was halfway between the xiphoid and
umbilicus and the other into the right umbilicus, both were
readily reducible.  The remainder of the incision felt
intact.  He did not have a noticeable diastasis  recti.  It
was at that time that a laparoscopic incisional hernia repair
was scheduled.  The patient presented to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2168-11-22**] to have that procedure performed.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient underwent a laparoscopic
ventral hernia repair with mesh.  The patient initially left
the OR in stable condition and was prepared to go home on
p.o. Dilaudid; however, in the early evening prior to leaving
the PACU, the patient started to complain of severe pain.  He
was, therefore, admitted for better pain control.

On the morning of [**2168-11-24**], the house officer was
called to the bedside for acute desaturation and shortness of
breath.  The patient was afebrile.  He had an 02 saturation
of 90% on nonrebreathable mask and 70% on room air.  The
vital signs were otherwise tachycardiac/normotensive.

An ABG was performed with a pH of 7.47, PC02 39, P02 68, base
excess over.  A CT angiogram was performed which revealed
bilateral pulmonary emboli.

The patient was transferred to the ICU and started with the
heparin anticoagulation protocol.  A NG tube was also placed
for onset of an ileus.  A venous duplex was performed on the
lower extremities to determine the location of the embolus.
A thrombus was found in the left common femoral vein which
was nonocclusive.

Octreotide was started for small bowel obstruction.  The
patient responded well to anticoagulation.  On [**2168-11-26**], the patient was transferred to the floor in stable
condition.  Also, on that day, his IV heparin was changed to
Lovenox and the patient started Coumadin therapy.

Today, on [**2168-11-27**], the patient will be discharged
in stable condition on a regular diet and tolerating it with
positive flatus and bowel movement.  He will be discharged on
Coumadin 5 mg p.o. q.d.  He will also be discharged on
Lovenox subcutaneously 80 mg b.i.d. as well as Dilaudid 2-4
mg p.o. q. four hours for pain.

FOLLOW-UP:  The patient will need to follow-up with his PCP
to follow his INRs for appropriate Coumadin dosing.  He is
being told to see his PCP on Tuesday.  The VNA will come on
Monday and do his first blood draw as well as observe Lovenox
administration.  Before he leaves, he and his wife will
receive Lovenox injection teaching.  The patient is to
follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in one to two weeks.

DIET/ACTIVITY:  The patient was discharged on ad lib diet, ad
lib activity with the exception of no lifting.
