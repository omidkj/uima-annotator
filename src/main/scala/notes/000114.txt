Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath

[**2115-2-22**] Tunneled hemodialysis line placement


History of Present Illness:
64 year old man with history of cadaveric kidney transplant in
[**2109**] after acute tubular necrosis from a viral gastroenteritis
whose kidney function has been slowly worsening of the past year
who presents with shortness of breath for 1 week.  Patient
reports cough and shortness of breath, mainly with extertion for
the past week.  The symptoms started with runny noise and the
patient thought he had a cold.  He notice dyspnea on extertion
when he was walking from his car to his house, a distance he is
normally able to do without difficulty.  He also has noted this
dry cough, worse at night that makes him sit up off the side of
the bed.  He denies any chest pain or history of chest pain with
extertion.  He also denies recent fevers, chills, nausea,
vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, or constipation.  He has
noticed a progressive decrease in his urine output over the past
year but no acute change recently.  He does not occasional
intermittent dysuria.  He denies any recent medication
non-compliance or change in his diet.  Patient does feel like he
has been gaining weight over the past few months.
.
The patient was also recently admitted at [**Hospital3 2568**] for a
similar progressive shortness of breath.  It was thought due to
his worsening renal function.  He was diuresed and he improved.
.
The patient also reports a fall two weeks prior to admission.
Patient tripped on stairs at his home and fell.  He did hit his
head but denies any LOC.  He denies any associated chest pain,
weakness, dizziness, or palpitations.

maintained on coumadin for 6 months.  currently not
anticoagulated
.
#Pericardial Effusion - s/p drainage, unclear etiology
.
#Kidney Disease - ESRD from ATN in setting of acute
gastroenteritis, s/p cadaveric kidney transplant in [**2109**],
worsening renal function over the last year.  Has appointment in
[**Month (only) **]. for AV fistula placement in anticipation of future dialysis
.
#Abdominal Wall Hernia - s/p repair after transplant
.
Multiple Knee surgeries 20 years ago

Physical Exam:
Vitals: 96.9, 132/80, 92, 20, 97% on 4L
GEN: Coughing repeatedly during interview with moderate
distress, some difficulty completing sentences because of
coughing
HEENT: PERRL, EOMI, Clear OP with MMM
Neck: no LAD, JVP difficutly to assess because of girth
CV: [**Last Name (un) 3526**] [**Last Name (un) 3526**], otherwise heart sounds difficutly to interpret
because of loud ronchi
Lungs: diffuse ronchi throughout lung fields, few crackles
apparent at bases
ABD: +BS nt nd, soft, obese, large irregular ventral hernia
appreciated
Ext: [**1-9**]+ peripheral edema, r>l, erythema of right leg but
without significant warmth or tenderness, some bruising at right
ankle.  2+ DP pulses, ROM at right ankles seems full

sensation grossly intact throughout

STUDIES
=======
UNILAT LOWER EXT VEINS RIGHT  [**2115-2-12**]
RIGHT LOWER EXTREMITY ULTRASOUND: The exam is technically
limited, because pain limited the patient's ability to tolerate
compression of the superficial femoral vein at its mid and
distal portions.  Grayscale and Doppler [**Year/Month/Day 108683**] were obtained
of the right common femoral, proximal superficial femoral, and
popliteal veins. Normal compressibility, color flow and
waveforms are seen. Color flow and Doppler [**Name (NI) 108683**], without
compression, were obtained for the mid and distal right
superficial femoral vein. Normal color flow and waveforms are
seen.  The left common femoral vein demonstrates normal color
flow and waveforms.  IMPRESSION: DVT highly unlikely. However,
cannot be completely ruled out due to technical limitations
resulting from patient discomfort. If clinical concern persists,
followup exam can be performed following appropriate pain
control.
.
AP PORTABLE CHEST [**2115-2-12**]
The study is limited secondary to AP portable technique and body
habitus. The cardiomediastinal configuration remains markedly
enlarged but stable. The cardiac silhouette is globular in
morphology. There is no superimposed edema or consolidation
evident. No effusion or pneumothorax is seen. Again noted and
slightly exaggerated is a dextroconcave curvature of the
thoracic spine likely at least in part positional.
IMPRESSION: Low lung volumes; however, no focal consolidation
seen. Stable marked cardiomegaly.
.
ECG Study Date of [**2115-2-12**]
Atrial fibrillation with moderate ventricular response. Diffuse
low voltage. Delayed precordial R wave transition. Diffuse
non-specific ST-T wave changes. Compared to the previous tracing
of [**2110-10-14**] atrial fibrillation has appeared. Rate 85, PR 0, QRS
88, QT/QTc 392/435, P 0, QRS 15, T 89
.
Portable TTE (Complete) Done [**2115-2-14**]
The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated. The estimated right atrial pressure is
10-15mmHg. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and
regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF 70%) Due to
suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality
cannot be fully excluded. There is no ventricular septal defect.
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral
valve prolapse. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion. Compared with
the findings of the prior report (images unavailable for review)
of [**2109-10-22**], cardiac rhythm now atrial fibrillation; no
pericardial effusion seen; otherwise findings similar.
.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2115-2-18**]
The right supraclavicular catheter remains in place with tip in
the right atrium. Bibasilar atelectasis are again seen, slightly
worsened on today's examination with a lower lung volume than
before. Small bilateral pleural effusion have not changed. There
is cardiomegaly along with minimal vascular congestion.  The
abdomen is gasless.  IMPRESSION:
1. Lower lung volume with more prominent bibasilar atelectasis.
2. Right central catheter still terminates in the right atrium,
for which repositioning is required.
