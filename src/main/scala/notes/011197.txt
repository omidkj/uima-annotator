History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 73 y/o M with a h/o ESRD s/p deceased donor
transplant [**2105**], DM2, CAD, PAF and CHF who presents with
weakness.  The patient reports that his symptoms started around
3 days ago.  At that time he had a fall onto concrete when he
tripped on his shoe and hit his head.  he denied LOC or
preceeding symptoms such as CP or SOB.  This morning he reports
feeling weak and fell out of his chair and hurt his knee and was
unable to get up.  The patient also describes itching "all over"
as well as having decreased PO intake and poor appetite over the
last few days.  He endorses one episode of non-bloody emesis 4
days ago but no further nausea or vomiting.  He denies melena or
abdominal pain.  He does report decreased urine output as well.

.
In ED VS were T 98.3  BP 132/64  HR 40  RR 18  O2 sat 96%.  He
received atropine 0.5mg IV x1, glucagon 1mg IV x1 given his
significant bradycardia with no significant HR response.  His BP
remained stable.  EKG showed a junctional rhythm, rate 38.
Pacer pads placed. Also received levoflox 750mg x1 for ? RLL
PNA.  Evaluated by renal transplant fellow in ED, renal US
showed no hydro. R knee films showed ? patellar avulsion fx vs
osteophyte and R knee to be placed in immobilizer.  He was
admitted to the MICU for further management.  On transport to
MICU HR [**Month (only) **]. to 20s and another 1mg atropine was administered
with HR inc. to 30s.

CXR: pulm vasc. congestion, no effusions, RLL opacity
CXR s/p pacemaker placment:  Compared with earlier the same day,
no significant change is detected. Again seen is a dual-lead
right-sided pacemaker with lead tips over right atrium and right
ventricle. No pneumothorax is detected. Also again seen is
marked cardiomegaly and pulmonary vascular plethora, with
interstitial edema and
increased retrocardiac density. Probable small left and ?small
right
effusion. Note is made of an unusual density arching over the
upper chest
immediately below clavicles - I suspect this represents
calcification in the aorta.

.
EKG: junctional bradycardia, no ischemic changes
.
Renal US [**2-24**]: The transplanted kidney is identified in the right
lower quadrant.  The transplanted kidney measures 13.8 cm. The
renal parenchyma echotexture appears slightly increased. There
is no hydronephrosis or perinephric fluid collection. Small
amount of perihepatic free fluid is seen.
Doppler evaluation of the transplanted kidney demonstrates color
flow
throughout the kidney. There is no diastolic flow with reverse
flow which makes the resistive indices literally 1.
.
R knee xray: Alignment is normal, and no fracture is seen. There
is faint chondrocalcinosis involving both menisci. Incidentally
noted is calcification of the proximal portion of the medial
collateral
ligament (Pellegrini-Stieda lesion) related to old trauma,
extensive
enthesophyte formation involving the inferior more than superior
patellar poles, and extensive vascular calcification.
.
Hip xray: The femoral heads remain well seated in the acetabula,
with no acute fracture seen. There are relatively symmetric
moderate degenerative changes involving both hip joints.
.
CT head: no acute bleed or mass


Brief Hospital Course:
73 y/o M with a h/o ESRD s/p deceased donor transplant [**2105**],
DM2, CAD, PAF and CHF who presents with weakness.  Found to be
in ARF with bradycardia.
.
# Bradycardia: Patient was in junctional bradycardia. He had a
temporary pacer wire placed which maintained a rate of 60.  His
coreg was held. After two days, he developed sinus initiated
beats and so his pacer threshold was decreased to 30 beats per
minute.  He maintained sinus bradycardia at a rate of 50-59, and
so his temporary pacemaker was discontinued on [**2-27**]. During
ambulation, the patient was unable to mount an adequate heart
rate response, and was therefore scheduled for pacemaker
placement. He received a dual chambered pacemaker on [**2-28**].  The
pacemaker was inserted through the right cephalic vein, and
given the patient's uremia and inadequate ability to clot, lost
1 unit of blood during the procedure.  The patient was
asymptomatic and there were no other complications. He received
3 days prophylaxtic Keflex s/p pacemaker placement, and has
compelted this course. He should follow up with the pacemaker
device clinic on [**2110-3-11**].
.
# ARF: ESRD s/p tansplant [**2105**].  Baseline Cr 1.5-1.7, presented
with level of 3.6. the renal service believes the precipitant of
ARF was poor renal perfusion from bradycardia. With improved
cardiac output, the patient's creatinine gradually declined. His
tacrolimus was followed and increased to 3mg PO BID.  His
cellcept was continued.  His diuretics were initially held in
the setting of ARF.  Torsemide  was restarted on [**2-27**]. He
subsquently developed mild bibasilar crackles, no hypoxia, and
Metolazone was also restarted on [**3-4**]. His tacrolimus was
increased to 3mg Po twice daily. Goal tacrolimus trough is [**3-26**].
He is to follow up in the [**Month/Day (3) **] clinic.
.
#SOB: patient developed several episodes of shortness of breath
and was found to be wheezy on exam. He was treated with
albuterol and ipratropium. As he was found to have mild crackles
and mild pulmonary edema on CXR after pacemaker placement, his
torsemide and metolazone were restarted.
.
# Anemia: patient with chronic anemia.  Likely [**12-21**] renal
failure.  Had HCT drop related to procedure, transfused 1u [**3-1**],
did not bump appropriately to pRBCs though remained stable
around 24-26. [**Month (only) 116**] need epo as outpatient - renal follow-up.
This will be communicated with his PCP.
.
# CAD: aspirin was continued.
.
# CHF: patient's diuretics and carvedilol were initially held.
His diuretics were restarted on [**2-27**], and his carvedilol was
readministered after is pacemaker placement.
.
# DM: Glypizide was held in the setting of acute on chronic
renal failure. He was maintained on an isulin sliding scale.
Glypizide may be restarted when his creatinine is back to
baseline.
.
# Functional status: Patient worked wth physical therapy and was
found to be unsteady on his feet. He was therefore reccommended
to be discharged to a rehab facility.
.
#) R leg injury- question patellar avulsion vs. osteophyte.
