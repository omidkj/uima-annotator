[**Age over 90 **] year-old Russian-speaking woman from [**Hospital 100**] Rehab presents
with shortness o breath and cough in the setting of recent viral
upper respiratory illness. She was given nebulizer treatments at
the [**Hospital 100**] Rehab without adequate improvement then required
increased oxygen. Her URI symptoms started 2-3 days prior to
presentation with worsening respiratory status.

In the ED, initial VS were: 86, 144/68, 24, 100%/8L. Documented
91% on room air. Tachypneic and wheezy improved some with
continuous nebs. Labs significant for creatinine 1.3 (baseline
unclear from records that came w/pt). Lactate was 2.1. WBC 10.8,
N85.4. Blood cultures were sent. Patient was given Albuterol,
Ipratropium, Levofloxacin, Vancomycin as well as Morphine 4mg
because she became more agitated and uncomfortable appearing. VS

CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2191-5-21**] 1:41 PM
SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST: There is blunting of the
costophrenic
angles bilaterally, consistent with small pleural effusions,
left slightly
greater than right. There is mild prominence of the central
pulmonary
vasculature. Heart size is at the upper limits of normal. There
is bibasilar atelectasis. There is no pneumothorax. There is
dense calcification of the aortic knob. Mediastinal contours are
within normal limits.
IMPRESSION: Small bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than
right.
Pulmonary vascular congestion.

CXR [**2191-5-22**]: FINDINGS: Exam is limited by respiratory motion.
This may account for blurring of bronchovascular structures in
the perihilar regions as well as indistinctness of the
diaphragmatic contours. However, considering clinical suspicion
for infection, repeat radiograph with suspended inspiration
would be helpful to exclude subtle abnormalities in these areas.
Heart is upper limits of normal in size. There are no pleural
effusions.

Brief Hospital Course:
[**Age over 90 **] year-old woman presented with respiratory failure in setting
of recent viral URI. CXR showed possible bilateral pleural
effusions and a question of pneumonia.  She was admitted to the
ICU to receive BiPAP therapy.  She was treated with broad
spectrum antibiotics with Vancomycin ([**Date range (1) 88553**]), Levofloxacin
([**Date range (1) 88554**]), and Cefepime ([**Date range (1) 88555**]).  She was transferred to the
floor on [**5-26**].  On the floor she continued to improve daily.
All antibiotics were completed by day of discharge on [**5-29**].  Her
respiratory status were signficantly improved on day of
discharge and patient was able to ambulate slowly without
requiring supplemental oxygen to maintain adequate oxygen
saturation.

PROBLEM LIST:
# Respiratory failure [**2-16**] pneumonia following a viral URI.  S/p
antibiotic course with Vanco, Levofloxacin, and Cefepime.  Pt
received nebulizer treatments throughout her hospitalization,
but this can be weaned as tolerated.  She also received a course
of steroids, but these were discontinued after 5 days because
they were causing delirium. Blood cultures were negative. Urine
culture negative, urine legionella negative.  Swallow eval
performed at bedside.  Pt does not overtly aspirate, but speech
therapy recommends thin liquids and pureed diet.
- Recommend continuing albuterol and ipratropium nebulizers for
shortness of breath or wheezing

# Acute kidney injury: Initial Cr 1.3.  Cr peaked at 3.2 [**2-16**]
urinary retention and probable dehydration from inadequate PO
intake. Family had initially declined use of foley catheter
until explained that it was medically necessary. Cr gradually
improved.  Urine culture negative.  Discharge Cr 2.3.
- Encourage adequate PO fluid intake
- Frequent monitoring for urinary retention

# Urinary retention: Straight cath prn urinary retention.

# Hypernatremia: Pt develope elevated Na 150 in setting of
decreased PO intake and decreased access to free water. Reported
feeling thristy. Was allowed to eat and drink and had gentle
fluid resucitation and sodium improved.
- Encourage adequate PO fluid intake

# Hypertension: Amlodipine increased to 10mg daily to improve
blood pressure control.

# De
