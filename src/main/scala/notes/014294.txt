It is not known when he was last seen. Staff of the rooming

ADDITIONAL INFO:
This is additional information about [**Known firstname 789**] [**Known lastname **] DOB
[**2064-10-30**].  Since there are no OMR notes on [**Known firstname 789**] [**Known lastname **], I
will summarize his OSH and outpatient records for the purpose of
continued care.

Only [**Hospital1 18**] computerized record of [**Known firstname 789**] [**Known lastname **] shows that
he had an EKG and head CT in [**2135-11-16**] which showed left axis
deviation and no evidence of acute intracranial pathologic
process, respectively.

Based on outpatient records, Mr. [**Known lastname **] followed at [**Location (un) 37619**]
Family Medicine, P.A. between the dates of [**2135-8-17**].
His vitals show that he had hypertension with blood pressure
range 124-218/62-84.  Weight had been relatively stable in the
151-154 in [**2138**].

His most recent vitals were from [**2140-2-18**] 98.6  192/83  64  20
wt 162.  Repeat BP 182/88.  At that visit, he was started on
Caduet [**4-30**] and continued on Benicar 40/25.  Diovan/HCTZ was
changed to Benicar on [**2139-10-19**].

Most recent outpatient visits, patient complained of fatigue,
blurred vision-visual changes, and nausea secondary to vytorin.

Pertinent Results:
CT HEAD [**2141-2-10**]: FINDINGS: Again seen is a large acute to
subacute infarct involving the distribution of the right MCA
with edema and effacement of the sulci in the right frontal,
parietal and temporal lobes, not significantly changed from the
earlier study. No areas of intracranial hemorrhage is
identified. Density indicating thrombus is again seen within the
sylvian fissure. There is no shift of midline structures or
effacement of the basal cisterns. There is age- appropriate
diffuse atrophy. Osseous and soft tissue structures are
unremarkable. Mild opacification of the mastoid air cells.
IMPRESSION: 1. Stable short interval appearance of acute to
subacute right MCA infarct without significant mass effect or
areas of hemorrhage identified.

CT HEAD with Contrast [**2141-2-10**]: There is an acute-to-subacute
infarct affecting the distribution of the right MCA with edema
and effacement of the sulci/gyri within the right frontal,
parietal and temporal lobes. Additionally there is a area of
dense clot identified within the sylvian fissure, corresponding
to the hemispheric/cortical branch distribution of this infarct.
No significant shift of midline structures, hemorrhage, or mass
effect on the lateral ventricles is identified. There is age
inappropriate diffuse atrophy and dense calcifications within
the intracranial carotid vessels. Osseous and soft tissue
structures are unremarkable. There is mild opacification of the
mastoid air cells with remaining paranasal sinuses well aerated.
IMPRESSION: 1. Acute-to-subacute right cortical distribution MCA
infarct with no significant mass effect/shift of midline
structures or areas of hemorrhage identified. These findings
were discussed with caring physician [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**First Name (STitle) **] on date of exam
at approximately 10:20 a.m. 2. Age inappropriate atrophy. 3.
Dense atherosclerotic disease with area of thrombus identified
within the right sylvian fissure.

OUTSIDE IMAGING--Studies from PCP from prior to admission:
[**2139-9-16**] Amb BP monitoring

CTA renal arteries [**2139-7-20**]: abdominal aorta no evidence of
aneurysm or dissection.  Scattered calcifications and mural wall
thrombus, particularly within infrarenal portion, [**Female First Name (un) 899**], SMA and
celiac artery widely patent at origins.  This is area of mild
narrowing in proximal portion of SMA.
.
Heavy calcifications in the common iliac arteries which extends
into the proximal iliac arteries and hypogastric arteries though
no flow limiting lesions.  Moderate stenosis involving the right
common femoral artery.

Likely cysts 1.4 cm and 8 mm in diameter in left lobe of liver.
Kidneys symmetric enhancement without hydronephrosis or stones.
Two rounded low density areas 3-4 mm in upper pole of left
kidney likely cyst.  Diverticulosis of colon. Osteoarthritic
changes.

IMPRESSION: No evidence of sign arterial occlusive disease
invovling renal arteries and no evidence of fibromuscular
dyplasia.
