Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1572**]
Chief Complaint:
scrotal swelling

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
HPI: 80 yo M with h/o DM, CAD (s/p CABG in [**2083**], [**2088**]), infarct
related cardiomyopathy (EF 20-25%), s/p biv ICD, prostate cancer
s/p b/l orchiectomy and TURP, [**Last Name (un) 938**] of bladder stones and
radiotherapy [**2110**], who p/w gradually increasing scrotal pain and
swelling as well as decreased UOP.  He states that this urinary
stream gradually became weaker in the last 3 days and then
nothing came out yesterday. His scrotum also became acutely
enlarged to the point where he could not walk. He also noticed
increased bilateral leg swelling, and that his "whole body is
leaking fluid". He has gained 12 pounds in the last 2 days. He
admits to eating TV dinners every 2-3 days for years, but
noticed a decreased appetite when his edema started. He states
he has been taking all his meds faithfully. Last night, he felt
SOB at rest and required his home O2 which he hasn't needed in a
while.  He also had concomitant chest pressure that was relieved
with 3 tabs of nitro (typically happens 3x/month). Denies
f/c/n/v, cough, orthopnea, palpitations, syncope, h/a,
dizziness.
.
Of note, pt was admitted in [**2-/2114**] for scrotal swelling and
renal failure [**12-27**] CHF exacerbation that responded to PO
torsemide but not IV lasix.
.
In ED, initial VS 97.4 80 101/60 20 98%. Because scrotal exam
was concerning for necrotizing fasciits, pt received
vanc/clinda. Scrotal US was obtained and Urology c/s felt no
contributing gaseous process. CXR showed cardiomegaly without
pulmonary edema or pleural effusions. Foley was also placed and
pt then admitted to Cardiology for management of likely CHF
exacerbation.
.
On arrival to the floor, VS 97.3 67 98/67 18 99%RA. Pt feels
well without CP or SOB.  Foley put out 350cc.

SCROTAL US  [**2115-1-31**]
FINDINGS: The patient is status post bilateral orchiectomies.
There is
marked enlargement of the scrotum with striking widespread edema
including
areas of ill-defined fluid, although there is no dominant or
discrete fluid collection. No definite foci of gas are
visualized.
IMPRESSION: Marked edema and ill-defined fluid, which could be
of infectious etiology or due to a form of third spacing in the
appropriate setting, without definite foci of gas or discrete
collection.
.
CXR  [**2115-1-31**]
FINDINGS: The patient is status post coronary artery bypass
graft surgery. A BiV pacemaker/ICD device with three leads
appears unchanged. The heart is moderately enlarged. The
cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged. The
lungs appear clear. There are no pleural effusions or
pneumothorax. Mild degenerative changes are similar along the
thoracic spine.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of acute disease.
.
RENAL US  [**2115-1-31**]
FINDINGS: The kidneys are normal in size with the right kidney
measuring 10.0 cm and the left kidney measuring 9.1 cm. Within
the left interpolar region, there is a 9 mm simple cyst. No
suspicious renal mass is seen. There is no hydronephrosis or
evidence of renal calculi. The bladder is collapsed and
suboptimally evaluated.
IMPRESSION: Small left renal simple cyst. Otherwise,
unremarkable renal
ultrasound with no hydronephrosis. No son[**Name (NI) 493**] evidence of
renal stone,
although CT is more sensitive.
.

The left atrium is elongated. The right atrium is moderately
dilated. No atrial s
