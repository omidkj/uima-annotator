Intubation

History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **] y ear old female with advanced Alzheimer's Disease, asthma,
and recent Right distal femur fracture s/p ORIF on [**2-18**] presents
[**2-25**] from nursing home with hypoxia. There, she was found to be
tachypneic with RR in 30s, O2 sat 87% RA, 90% on 2L. EMS was
called, and she was given SL NTG and IV lasix.  Per her
daughter, over the past 2 days, she has been more somnolent than
usual. She had no complaints except leg pain and involuntary
movements of her right arm. She denied cough, shortness of
breath, chest pain, urinary symptoms, diarrhea. Her daughter
also noted that her left arm was swollen but does not know for
how long. In the ED, the patient was febrile to 104.8. Her
respiratory rate was in the 30s. Her O2 sats were 85-90% RA, and
she was placed on NRB. Due to continued respiratory distress,
she was intubated. Following intubation, she was noted to have
coffee grounds in her ET tube, which cleared with lavage. She
was given IV protonix, in addition to IVF, levofloxacin,
vancomycin, metronidazole, combivent, and Decadron prior to
admission to the medical ICU.
On arrival to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], she was sedated from propofol. She was
shivering and diaphoretic.

Social History:
She is currently living at [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 55**] after right ORIF
on [**2-18**]. She lived with her daughter prior to the femur fx. She

[**2-25**] EKG: Sinus tachycardia. Prior inferior myocardial
infarction. Prior anteroseptal myocardial infarction. ST segment
elevation in leads II, III, aVF and V2-V3 raising the question
of active ischemia. Followup and clinical correlation are
suggested. No previous tracing available for comparison.

[**2-25**] Right Tib/fib:  Diagnostic quality is limited by overlying
casting material and probable diffuse osteopenia. There is an
angulated and impacted comminuted fracture involving the distal
right femoral metadiaphysis. Vascular calcifications are
present. No leg or ankle fracture is evident, although
assessment is again limited by casting material and osteopenia.
Talar dome contour is smooth. A right-sided dynamic hip screw is
seen in the right femur, but is incompletely assessed as it
extends off the superior aspect of the imaged field of view. No
Previous studies are available for comparison.

[**2-25**] Abdominal ultrasound: COMPLETE ABDOMEN ULTRASOUND: The
right kidney measures 7.1 cm in length. The left kidney measures
7.1 cm in length. There is no hydronephrosis or nephrolithiasis.
No perirenal fluid collections or masses are seen. The liver
appears unremarkable without focal or textural abnormalities.
There is no intra- or extrahepatic biliary dilatation. The
common bile duct measures 4 mm. Hepatic veins are patent but
appear prominent and note is made of reflux indicating probable
right heart insufficiency. The gallbladder is distended
measuring 5.5 x 6.7 cm in size. The gallbladder contains sludge,
no stones are seen. The gallbladder wall is within normal limits
and no pericholecystic fluid is seen. The main portal vein is
patent with appropriate flow directionality. The aorta is normal
in caliber throughout its visualized portion. Aorta and IVC are
patent with appropriate waveforms. The visualized portions of
the pancreas appear unremarkable. Pancreatic tail is not well
seen due to overlying bowel gas. The spleen measures 7.7 cm and
appears normal. No ascites is seen.

[**2-25**] left upper extremity ultrasound: Left internal jugular,
subclavian, axillary and brachial veins was performed with ormal
compressibility, waveforms, augmentation and Doppler flow
demonstrated. There is no evidence of intraluminal clot.

[**2-26**] CT abdomen/chest/pelvis: CT OF THE CHEST: Small mediastinal
lymph nodes are seen which do not meet criteria for pathologic
enlargement. The caliber of the thoracic aorta is normal. The
heart is not enlarged. There is a small simple pericardial
effusion. Extensive coronary artery calcifications are seen. The
lungs do not demonstrate any regions of consolidation. There are
small bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left, and
associated minimal lower lobe atelectasis. Narrowing of the main
stem bronchi, particularly on the left is consistent with
bronchomalacia. The non-contrast study limits assessment of
abdominal organs. The liver, spleen, pancreas, and adrenal
glands appear unremarkable. The gallbladder is distended
measuring up to 0.9 cm, as was seen on the ultrasound. Contrast
reaches the proximal colon. No dilated loops of bowel are seen.
There is no free intraperitoneal air or ascites. There is
hydronephrosis or nephrolithiasis. The abdominal aorta
demonstrates extensive atherosclerotic calcifications but is of
normal caliber. Artifact from a right femoral screw limits
assessment. A Foley catheter is within the bladder lumen. The
rectum appears unremarkable. There is diffuse body wall edema
consistent with anasarca. Small foci of subcutaneous air in the
anterior abdominal wall are consistent with injection sites

[**2-26**] TTE: The left atrium is normal in size. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular  hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
There is moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction
with severe hypokinesis of the distal half of the septum and
anterior walls, and distal inferior wall. The apex is akinetic
and mildly aneurysmal. No masses or thrombi are seen in the left
ventricle. The remaining left ventricular segments contract
normally. Right ventricular chamber size is normal with focal
hypokinesis of the apical free wall (clip #[**Clip Number (Radiology) **]). The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
present. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is
seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a small circumferential pericardial effusion without
evidence of hemodynamic compromise.

[**2-28**] CXR: Endotracheal tube again seen with tip approximately
3.5 cm above the carina right-sided subclavian line seen with
tip in the region of the cavoatrial junction. Nasogastric tube
is again seen coiled within the stomach. Cardiac and mediastinal
contours appear stable. Again s
