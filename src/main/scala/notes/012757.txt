Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to the floor and transfused 3 units
PRBCs overnight.  She reported feeling better after the
transfusions although not yet back to her baseline.  After her
3rd unit Mrs. [**Known lastname **] became febrile to 101.7 F and was
hypertensive and tachycardic to SBP 188 and HR 118.  Blood,
urine, and stool cultures were sent. A CXR the night prior was
negative for pneumonia and her lung exam was clear. Her fever
responded well to tylenol, her vitals normalized, and as her
repeat Hct was only 28.8 from 22.1, she was pretreated with 25
mg of Benadryl and transfused a fourth unit of PRBCs. However,
after a third of the unit was transfused she again spike a
fever, this time to 103.5 with SBPs again into te 180s and HR to
115.  She complained only of feeling very cold but was rigorous.
She was given 1 gram of tylenol and 50 mg of benadryl and a
transfusion reaction report was started.  The blood bank
resident was contact[**Name (NI) **] and hematology oncology was consulted.

MICU course:
75 yo woman with a h/o GI angiodysplasia and Q2wk transfusions
who presents with fatigue, decreased Hcts, leukocytosis, and
increased creatinine from baseline. Now s/p bradycardic arrest,
found to have worsening ARF, lactic acidosis, and elevated
cardiac enzymes.
.
#) Bradycardic arrest: She had episodes of aflutter and
Wenkebach block during this admission, was likely due to
infection, possibly endocarditis given the recent MSSA
bactermia, or an MI as the patient had elevated cardiac enzymes.
 She was noted to have hyperkalemia, but this was unclear [**Name2 (NI) 16053**]
this was a hemolyzed samples.  She was bradycardic through the
first evening in the ICU, she became hypotensive and required
dopamine pressor to maintain her pressures.  Initially,
trancutaneous pacers were placed in order to address her
symptomatic bradycardia, but after discussion with family
regards to her prognosis, the family decided to withdraw
invasive measures.  The patient expired with respiratory failure

.
#) Anion gap metabolic acidosis: Likely due to lactic acidosis
combined with uremia. Lactic acidosis likely [**1-4**] hypoperfusion
during bradycardic arrest, and possibly sepsis.  Her lactate
initially improved with hydration, she had a KUB and abdominal
exam which did not support a bowel performation.  She was
treated with normal saline boluses, and bicarb as her acidosis
worsened

.
#) ARF: pt with increasing Cr throughout hospitalization
(baseline 1.3-1.5), now 4.7. Likely secondary to hypoperfusion
with sepsis, she became anuric, renal was consulted, but
dialysis was not indicated, and she expired from respiratory
failure.

.
#) ID/MSSA bacteremia: Pt with h/o multipe blood cultures which
grew MSSA, likely source was Port-A-Cath (now removed). Pt
continues to have rising WBC count, and now with 1/2 blood cx's
positive for GPC in clusters from yesterday.  She was started on
broad spectrum antibiotics including aztreonam, vancomycin and
flagyl as with a pencillin allergy.

.
#) Elevated cardiac enzymes: Pt had elevated CK-MB and trop s/p
bradycardic arrest. Also with ? 1mm STE in subsequent EKG. If
ischemia is present, likely demand related.  Anticoagulation was
held in the setting of chronic GI bleeds.

#) Anemia: pt has known GI AVM, likely source of hct drop (pt is
transfusion dependent).

#) Cirrhosis/elevated LFT's: Pt with known portal HTN and
ascites.  An ultrasound only showed small amounts of ascites,
and a chronic gallstone, without evidence of cholecystitis. She
was continued on octreotide, and ciprofloxacin

#) Resp failure: Pt intubated during code situation. She was
maintained on the ventilator until the family decided to support
only comfort measures, and the ventilator was shut off, and she
died of respiratory failure.
