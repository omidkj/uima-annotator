HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 77 yo right handed woman with a history of
squamous cell cancer who presents as a code stroke.

According to her son, the patient was watching TV this evening
around midnight when he noted a left facial droop, robotic
speech
and left sided weakness.  He felt as though the face/speech
symptoms where improving and so he did not call EMS at that
time.
However, when he attempted to get her up at around 4AM, he noted
that she continued to have difficulty ambulating and her speech
was again slurred.  He called 911 and the patient was brought to
[**Hospital1 18**]. Upon arrival, a Code stroke was called.  NIHSS at the
time
of arrival was 5.  She was quickly scanned and a right MCA
territory infarct was identified.  She was given a full dose
aspirin.

Currently, the patient reports feeling well.  She states that
she
didn't even know anything was wrong with her at the time of
symptom onset and that her son pointed it out.  She denies any
recent illness and infact, she was out walking briskly the day
prior.  She has no headache, neck pain, changes in vision,
dysphagia, lightheadedness, vertigo, tinnitus or hearing
difficulty. She denied difficulties producing or comprehending
speech.  She reports no focal weakness, numbness, parasthesiae.
No bowel or bladder incontinence or retention. She enied
difficulty with gait.

On general review of systems, the patient denied recent fever or
chills, cough, shortness of breath, chest pain/palpitations,
nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea. She denies dysuria. All other ROS
were negative.

Studies:

CTA head and neck:

IMPRESSION:
1. The findings suggest an acute embolus within the distal M1
segment of the right middle cerebral artery, associated with a
small infarct within the anterior right frontal lobe and a much
broader area of tissue at risk
encompassing just under 50% of the right middle cerebral artery
territory.

2. Multifocal atherosclerosis as detailed.

3. 3.4 cm right submandibular space mass, which may represent a
pathologic
lymph node. There is associated asymmetric thickening of the
tongue base on the right and the findings are concerning for an
oropharyngeal tumor such as squamous cell carcinoma with an
adjacent metastatic node. ENT consultation and direct inspection
are recommended.

4. Biapical scarring with what may represent nodular
consolidation within the visualized lung apices, which should be
correlated with a dedicated chest CT.

Perfusion findings were appropriately identified by the on-call
radiology
resident and communicated to the clinical service at the time of
study, and the additional findings of the right neck mass were
discussed with the
managing neurology service, Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 656**], at the time of
dictation at
10:30 hours on [**2112-5-16**].

MRI brain [**5-18**]:

IMPRESSION:
1. Acute/subacute right middle cerebral artery distribution
infarct involving
portions of the corona radiata, likely secondary to occlusion of
small
penetrating arteries. Equivocal area of subacute infarct within
the left
centrum semiovale.

2. The acute changes are superimposed upon sequelae of chronic
microvascular
white matter ischemic disease with old hemorrhagic lacunar
infarct within the right lentiform nucleus.

ECHO: [**5-17**]

The left atrium is mildly dilated. The left atrium is elongated.
No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D,
color Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers. The estimated
right atrial pressure is 0-5 mmHg. There is mild
