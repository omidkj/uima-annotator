Chief Complaint:
Bilateral lower extremity swelling and pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 73 yo male with CAD s/p CABG x4V in [**2154**], HTN,
HL, A. fib on coumadin, type 2 DM, with chronic venous stasis
and recurrent LLE cellulitis discharged from [**Hospital1 18**]-[**Location (un) 620**] in
[**6-16**] for MRSA cellutis now presenting with increase right
lower extremity warmth, swelling, redness. He reported having a
temperature to 102.4 earlier in the morning.  Per wife, patient
denied shortness of breath, cough, chest pain, diarrhea,
abdominal pain, dysuria.
.
On arrival to the ED, patient's vitals were T 98.7, HR 103, BP
74/55, RR 28, O2 sat 89-93% on RA.  In the ED, BP fell to 64/47.
 He was given 5L IVF but remained hypotensive, so was started on
Levophed.  He was given Vancomycin and Zosyn to cover
cellulitis.  He got a CTA which showed no PE but showed
bilateral pneumonia; CT abd/pelvis unremarkable.  He had
increasing respiratory distress and remained hypoxic, so was
intubated.

Imaging:
CXR.  [**2168-10-20**].
SEMI-UPRIGHT AP VIEW OF THE CHEST: There has been interval
placement of an endotracheal tube with tip approximately 5 cm
from the carina, in standard position. A feeding tube is also
demonstrated with tip extending inferior to the diaphragm, below
the inferior borders of the film. Right internal jugular central
venous catheter is unchanged. There is persistent pulmonary
edema, not significantly changed from the interval. No
pneumothorax.
.
IMPRESSION: Satisfactory positioning of the endotracheal tube
and feeding tube. Persistent pulmonary edema.
.
CT Chest/Abd/Pelvis. [**2168-10-20**].  No PE.  B/l pulmonary
consolidations with bilateral pleural effusions.
.
Echo. [**8-14**].
No mass/thrombus is seen in the left atrium or left atrial
appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color
Doppler. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF>55%). There are complex (>4mm, non-mobile) atheroma in the
descending thoracic aorta. A bileaflet aortic valve prosthesis
is present. The aortic prosthesis appears well seated, with
normal disc motion. No masses or vegetations are seen on the
aortic, mitral, tricuspid or pulmonary valves. No aortic valve
abscess is seen. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate (2+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial effusion.
.
IMPRESSION: No vegetations or abcess. Normal appearance of
aortic valve prosthesis. Moderate mitral regurgitation.
.
EKG.  A. fib, HR 100, normal QRS interval, normal QTc interval,
no q waves, TWI in I, L.  No st elevations or depressions.
Unchanged from prior EKG.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P:  Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 73 yo male with CAD with preserved EF,
type 2 DM, HTN, HL, h/o CVA, s/p mechanical AVR on coumadin,
admitted with septic shock likely secondary to pneumonia and RLE
cellulits. Patient was admitted to the ICU intubated and on
pressors. Over his 5 day course in the ICU, he was on vanc/zosyn
for coverage of pneumonia and MRSA cellulitis in bilateral
extremitites. Patient had history of agitation and
hallucinations at baseline that made weaning down of sedation
challenging. By day #4, patient was weaned off fentanyl and
versed drips and was on short acting propofol for sedation.
Family meeting was held regarding goals of care and patient's
wishes were respected and he was made DNR/Do not reintubate.
Patient was extubated at 4:30pm on [**10-24**] and main goal of care
after extubation was to keep the patient comfortable. Patient
was on IV morphine for pain and comfort. He expired on 12:17am
of [**10-25**] with family at bedside. Patient seemed comfortable and
immediate cause of death was cardiac arrest secondary to sepsis.
