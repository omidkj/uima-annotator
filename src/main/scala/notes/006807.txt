Chief Complaint:
Chest pain.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None.


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 48 year-old male with a history of CAD/CHF
(s/p pacer and AICD with EF 15%) and ESRD transferred here from
an OSH with chest pressure and wide complex tachycardia in 120s.


He awoke this morning (10:45am) and noticed [**5-1**] chest pressure
with walking. It would subside with rest, but return with any
exertion. He also noticed that his radial pulse was ~100, much
higher than his baseline of ~50. He also felt nauseated and
diapheretic and as though he was going to "pass out". Denies any
shortness of breath. Given his symptomas, he called EMS.

EMS arrived at 11:03pm. Vital showed SBPs in the 120s with HR in
the 80s-90s. Two aspirin were given. EKG showed a wide complex
tachycardia (? V-paced). He was brought to an OSH where his BP
was 120/70 with a rate of 80. CK was 21 with a troponin I of
0.04. An EKG showed an irregular tachcardia with IVCD. He was
bolussed with amiodarone and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for futher
management. CEs were normal.

In the ED, his initial VS were: BP 97/57, HR 96, RR 16, O2 sat
100% on room air. His SBPs remained in the 80-90s in the ED with
HR in the 110s (wide-complex). Before transfer to the floor, his
HR decreased to the 50s.

He received Plavix 75, ASA 325, morphine 2mg IV x2, Dilaudid 2mg
IV x1, and was placed on a heparin gtt. He was admitted to the
CCU for further monitoring and EP interrogation.

Social History:
Social history is significant for the absence of current tobacco
use (10 pack-year history having quite ~[**2179**]). There is a
history of alcohol abuse prior to his MI, but no current use.

Family History:
There is no family history of premature coronary artery disease
(although fater did have CAD) or sudden death.


Physical Exam:
vitals - BP 119/81 mmHg while lying flat; HR 53beats/min and
regular; RR 13breaths/min with an O2 sat of 100% on room.
gen - well developed, well nourished and well groomed; oriented
to person, place and time; mood and affect were not
inappropriate.
heent - no xanthalesma and conjunctiva were pink with no pallor

cor - normal S1 and S2; II/VII holosystolic murmur best heard at
apex; no rubs, clicks or gallops
abd - abdominal aorta was not enlarged by palpation; no
hepatosplenomegaly or tenderness; abdomen was soft nontender and
nondistended; midline scar was noted
ext - no pallor, cyanosis, clubbing or edema.
vasc - no abdominal, femoral or carotid bruits. Inspection
and/or palpation of skin and subcutaneous tissue showed no

Brief Hospital Course:
1. CAD:
Prior anterior MI with stends to LAD. He presented with chest
pains that were worrisome for an ACS.  Given that the pain was
associated with tachycardia and resolved with resolution of his
tachycardia, there was less worry for ACS.  This might have
represented a demand process (angina) as opposed to an acute
coronary syndrome (unstable angina). Of note, the patient does
not appear to have anginal symptoms at other times as he is able
to walk and exert himself without chest discomfort or other
symptoms.  Hiis beta-blocker was increased (see below) and he
was continued on statin and warfarin (given severely akinetic
LV).  In addition, the patient did not present on aspirin (he
had been told he did not need to take it); this was started at
81mg daily.

2. Pump:
Has EF of <20% with multiple near akinetic areas (basal
inferoseptal, inferior, and inferolateral walls contract best
with the other areas akinetic). He appeared euvolemic on exam.
He did not present on an ACEI; the patient stated that some
"levels were high" on prior ACEI.  This was not restarted,
although consideration for it's use could be re-addressed by his
outpatient cardiologist.

3. Rhythm:
His presenting rhythm appeared to be atrial tachycardia/atrial
fibrillation.  EP interogated the pacer and felt that the atrial
lead was undersensing but pacing normally, causing inappropriate
atrial pacing. The sensitivity was increased from 0.6mV to 0.3mV
with better sensing seen after the change.  His beta-blocker
(Toprol XL) was increased from 25mg to 75mg daily and amiodarone
was continued.  Plan was for outpatient EP follow-up.

4. ESRD:
Etiology of this is unclear. [**Name2 (NI) **] the patient, this came about
after his first MI.  His AV fistula had recently matured and was
used for a dialysis session the morning after admission.
Nephrocaps and Sevalemer were continued.

5. Hyperkalemia:
Morning after admission, had potassium of 6.4. Got
insulin/dextrose/calcium and, later, was dialyzed.  Potassium
was normal thereafter.

6. Hypoglycemia:
Fingerstick 44 with syptoms after insulin given.  This was
likely secondary to poor clearance of insulin in the setting of
renal failure.

7. Abdominal pain:
Patient had significant abdominal pain, which he attributed to
peritoneal fluid overload in the setting of IVF administration.
Had a history of these pains and reported great response to
dialysis.  Before he was able to be dialyzed, he was given
morphine for symptom control.  After dialysis, the pain resolved
and did not re-occur.
