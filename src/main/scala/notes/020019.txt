Service:

This dictation summary is an addendum to dictation summary,
which was dictated on the [**11-19**].  Since the last
dictation on the 7th the hospital course of the patient has
been largely stable.

1.  Initial hypoxic respiratory failure:  The patient
steadily improved on ventilation.  The patient began a CPAP
trial on [**11-21**] and did well.  The patient was then put
on CPAP of a PEEP of 5 and pressure support of 5 on [**11-22**] and remained to saturate well in the high 90s and showed
no signs of respiratory distress.  The patient therefore
remained on CPAP for the remainder of hospital stay.  The
patient will be evaluated for a talking trach on the day of
discharge and a wait placement into along term facility for
bed rehab.

service.  The patient was hemodynamically stable for the
remainder of hospital stay.

3.  Rapid atrial fibrillation:  The patient remained in sinus
rhythm for the remainder of his hospital stay.

4.  Coronary artery disease:  The patient again displayed
pink sputum on the night of [**11-19**].  Differential for
this included pulmonary edema from congestive heart failure.
The patient was  diuresed prn with Lasix and showed good
resolve.  The patient had no further episodes of pink frothy
sputum throughout the remainder of his hospital stay.  An
electrocardiogram was obtained at this time and no change was
detected from his previous electrocardiogram indicating no
acute events.

5.  Neurology:  Since last dictation the patient continued to
steadily improve strength of his left side.  The patient had
baseline weakness on his right side from a previous cerebral
event.  The patient was evaluated and received physical
therapy for the remainder of his hospital stay.

6.  Endocrine:  The patient was discontinued on an insulin
drip on [**11-21**] and put on long acting insulin as well as
sliding scale.  Level of long term insulin was titrated
accordingly.

7.  Gastrointestinal:  The patient continued to have guaiac
positive, but no melanotic stool for the remainder of the
hospital stay.  The patient should be arranged for an
outpatient colonoscopy once all other issues have been
resolved.  The patient's hematocrit remained stable after
this MD came on service.

8.  Hematocrit:  As stated above hematocrit remained stable
largely throughout the remainder of his hospital stay.  At
that time his drop in hematocrit was attributed to his
hematoma, which was noted on the right glutea status post
catheterization.  No further indication of active bleeding
was noted as hematocrit remained stable and the patient's
vital signs also remained stable.  It was likely that the
hematoma had stabilized and resorption had begun.

9.  Fluids, electrolytes and nutrition:  The patient was
continued on OG tube feeds.  It was noted that the rehab
facility will not accept the patient with an OG tube
placement.  The patient will be sent down for IR assisted
placement of a post pyloric nasogastric tube.  The patient
did not wish for an nasogastric tube to be placed without
sedation.

10.  Code status:  The patient remained in full code status
throughout the duration of his stay.

DISPOSITION:  The patient will be placed in a long term vent
facility for rehabilitation and physical therapy.
