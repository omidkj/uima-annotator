History of Present Illness:
HPI: Mr. [**Known lastname 87813**] is a 41 yo otherwise healthy male who presents
with syncope. His history is significant for a recent motorcycle
accident 2 wks prior to admission, for which he underwent knee
surgery at [**Hospital1 2177**] for a fractured left kneecap. He was placed in a
soft brace, was minimally ambulatory, and did not receive
outpatient anticoagulation therapy. 3 days prior to admission,
he developed shortness of breath on exertion, for which he used
his albuterol inhaler with limited benefit. He denies any
associated chest pain, fevers or chills. On the morning of
admission ([**10-31**]), he experienced a syncopal episode and fell
while walking down the stairs. Per his family, he was found at
the bottom of the stairs, had a frothy substance in his mouth,
urinated involuntarity, but did not have any tongue biting or
tonic-clonic movements. He was then brought to the ED at [**Hospital **]
hospital.
.
In the [**Hospital **] hospital ED, he was not in acute distress and had
no signs of head trauma. Vital signs: T 98.1, HR 110, BP 116/78,
RR 11, O2 94% on RA, 100% on 3-4L. CT of the head and neck
showed no abnormalities. A CTA showed R ventricular enlargement
with a saddle pulmonary embolus obstructing the R & L main
pulmonary arteries. A bedside ultrasound showed RV dilatation
without collapse of LV. Labs were significant for PT 14.5, INR
1.6, WBC 20 (78% neuts, 13% lymps), Hct 36.2, Plt 469. He
received a 5000 unit heparin bolus with 1000 units / hour
thereafter, and was transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] for additional
care.
.
In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, he appeared stable and did not have chest pain
or shortness of breath. Vital signs: T 98.1 HR:110 BP:116/78
Resp:18 O(2)Sat:100. He received 1L NS, was continued on
heparin, and admitted for further monitoring and treatment.

.
Head & neck CT ([**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]): Negative noncontrast head CT scan.
No acute cervical fracture or malalignment.
.
Chest CT ([**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]): There are large filling defects in R and
L main pulmonary arteries as well as the subsegmental pulmonary
arteries supplying the upper lobes, lower lobes, and right
middle lobe. A saddle embolism is noted. There is right
ventricular enlargement consistent with R heart strain. No
airspace consolidation or pleural effusion. Multiple
subcentimeter hilar and mediastinal lymph nodes are present,
clinical correlation recommended.
.
EKG:  Sinus tachycardia. Nonspecific ST changes.
.
Echocardiogram: Right ventricular cavity enlargement with free
wall hypokinesis. Pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Mild-moderate tricuspid regurgitation. Dilated ascending aorta.
No definite intracardiac shunt identified.
.
L Knee x-ray: There is an overlying brace which limits fine bony
detail. There are anterior surgical skin staples. There is
irregularity of the inferior pole of the patella compatible with
recent surgery. There is soft tissue swelling anteriorly. No
additional fractures are seen.

Brief Hospital Course:
41 yo otherwise healthy male with recent history of MVA and knee
surgery who presents with SOB and syncope due to saddle
pulmonary embolism.
.
# Pulmonary embolism: Mr. [**Known lastname 87813**] was found to have a saddle PE
by chest CT from an OSH. His PE was likely secondary to
immobilization in the setting of a recent MVA and surgery for L
patellar fracture. In the hospital, he had an episode of hypoxia
(PaO2 66) and tachycardia, prompting admission to the ICU. He
was treated with bolus and continuous IV heparin therapy.
Fibrinolysis was not performed given his hemodynamic stability.
An echocardiogram on [**11-1**] showed R ventricular cavity
enlargement with free wall hypokinesis, mild-moderate tricuspid
regurgitation. After remaining hemodynamically stable in the
ICU, he was transferred to the medicine service, where he
remained stable until the time of discharge. Heparin was
discontinued and Lovenox bridge to Coumadin was started. At the
time of discharge (hospital day 4), he was comfortable, had an
ambulatory O2 saturation of 99%, and had an INR of 1.7. He will
require 3 months of anticoagulation for a provoked PE. An
echocardiogram is recommended in 3 months to evaluate for
resolution of R heart dilation. He will follow up with his PCP
for discontinuation of Lovenox and continued Coumadin dosing.
.
# s/p L knee surgery: He underwent orthopedic surgery for L
patellar fracture at PBMC 2 wks PTA. In the [**Hospital1 18**], his pain was
well controlled with oxycodone and acetaminophen. On exam, there
were scattered open wounds on lateral aspect of the L knee,
intact staples, and moderate areas of bruising. No active
infections were noted. Dressings were changed daily. He worked
with physical therapy and demonstrated ability to ambulate
safely with crutches. Ortho recommended removing his staples in
[**4-30**] days, and he will follow-up with Ortho at [**Hospital1 18**] on [**11-9**]. At the time of discharge, his pain was well controlled and
he was able to ambulate with crutches.
.
# Tinea Cruris: identified clinically on presentation treated
with Miconazole topical cream with good effect. He should
continue miconazole 2% topical cream twice a day for 2 weeks.
