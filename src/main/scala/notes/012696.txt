Brief Hospital Course:
[**Known lastname **],[**Known firstname 94726**] Pre-operatively, he was consented. A CXR, EKG, UA,
CBC,  Electrolytes, T/S - were obtained,  all other preparations
were  made.

It was decided that she would undergo:

OPERATION PERFORMED:
1. Ultrasound-guided puncture of left common femoral
    artery.
2. Contralateral second-order catheterization of right
    dorsalis pedis artery.
3. Serial arteriogram of the right lower extremity.
4. Angioplasty of right vein graft to dorsalis pedis artery
    anastomotic stenosis.

Prepped, and brought down to the endo suite room for  surgery.
Intra-operatively, was closely monitored and remained
hemodynamically stable. Tolerated the procedure well without any
difficulty or complications.

Post-operatively, transferred to the PACU for further
stabilization and monitoring.

Was then transferred to the VICU for further recovery. While in
the VICU,  received monitored care. When stable was delined.
Diet was advanced.

When stabilized from the acute setting of post operative care,
was then transferred to floor status.

While on the floor he had a syncopical event. Neuro was called.
Head CT hegative. R/O for stroke. He recovered rapidly. Unknown
etiology.

On the floor, remained hemodynamically stable with pain
controlled. Continues to make steady progress without any
incidents. Discharged home in stable condition.

Received preoperative hydration. On DC the creatinine is stable.
