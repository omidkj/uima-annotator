History of Present Illness:
77 yo M with history of COPD, small cell lung cancer (14 years
ago) and adenocarcinoma of the lung resected in [**5-/2144**] with no
evidence of recurrence who presents with 2-3 days of cough and
SOB. He developed worsening cough productive of yellow and white
sputum 2-3 days prior to admission with shortness of breath. He
reports chest pain only when coughing and his cough has been
chronic for "years". No fevers or chills at home, no increased
leg edema, orthopnea, wheezing or palpitations. He does report
poor appetite and weight loss over the past few days. No recent
travel or immobilization, no sick contacts. His lung cancer has
shown no signs of symptoms of recurrence as of [**1-1**]. He called
EMS and found to be 85% on RA this morning.

134/68, RR 19, O2Sat 91% 4L NC. Patient had CXR showing diffuse
opacities and mild pulmonary edema. He received ceftriaxone and
levofloxacin for presumed CAP. He additionally received
albuterol and ipratropium and 2L NS. Labs were significant for a
bicarb of 19, WBC of 11.7, and a lactate of 2.3. Vitals prior to

IMAGING:
[**2151-3-26**] CXR
Portable AP upright chest radiograph obtained. There is marked
emphysema with stable areas of scarring along the medial aspect
of the right lung with suture material projecting over the right
upper lobe. Subtle nodular opacities in the lower lungs
bilaterally are concerning for early pneumonia. No pleural
effusion or pneumothorax is seen. Cardiomediastinal silhouette
appears grossly stable. The imaged osseous structures appear
intact.
IMPRESSION: Marked emphysema, stable scarring in the right lung,
subtle nodular opacities in the lower lungs concerning for early
pneumonia.
.
[**2151-3-27**] CXR
Comparison is made to previous study from [**2151-3-26**].
There is increased density at the right base, which is new since
the previous study and suggestive of right lower lobe collapse.
Volume loss in the right side is also seen. There are streaky
densities within the apices projecting from the mediastinum
suggestive of scarring. Cardiac silhouette and mediastinum are
within normal limits. There are again seen some streaky
densities at the left base, which may represent atelectasis or
early infiltrate.
IMPRESSION:
1. Likely right lower lobe collapse with increased density and
volume loss at the right base.
2. Scarring within the upper lobes bilaterally.
.
[**2151-3-29**] CXR
As compared to the previous radiograph, there is a slight
increase in extent of the pre-existing right and left pleural
effusions. The effusion on the left is confined to the lung
bases, on the right, the effusion occupies approximately
one-quarter to one-third of the right hemithorax. Subsequent
areas of bilateral atelectasis. Known right and left
paramediastinal fibrosis. No newly appeared lung parenchymal
changes. No evidence of pneumothorax.
.
[**2151-3-29**] CXR
As compared to the previous radiograph, a pre-existing opacity
at the left lung base is visually minimally more apparent.
Although this could be due to technical factors, aspiration
cannot be excluded. The pre-existing pleural effusions are
unchanged in extent.
.
[**2151-3-30**] CXR
As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has been
intubated. The tip of the endotracheal tube projects 5 cm above
the carina. The patient has also received a nasogastric tube,
and the course of the tube is unremarkable, the tip of the tube
is not visualized on the image. The pre-existing right pleural
effusion has substantially decreased in extent. The small
effusion on the left and the opacity at the left lung bases are
unchanged. No evidence of complications, notably no
pneumothorax.
.
[**2151-3-30**] ECHO (TTE)
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There is moderate to
severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
akinesis of the mid- and distal anterior wall, septum and apex.
The remaining segments contract normally (LVEF = 30%). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened (?#). There is no
aortic valve stenosis. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is moderate
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
effusion.
IMPRESSION: Moderate to severe regional left ventricular
systolic dysfunction, c/w LAD-territory infarction or Takotsubo
cardiomyopathy. Mild aortic and mitral regurgitation. Moderate
pulmonary hypertension.
Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable
for review) of [**2144-5-29**], regional LV systolic dysfunction
