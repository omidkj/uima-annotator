Admission Date:  [**2191-11-26**]       Discharge Date:  [**2191-12-13**]

Date of Birth:   [**2171-4-28**]       Sex:  M

Service:  TRAUMA

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 20-year-old male,
pedestrian struck by a car, unknown loss of consciousness,
but the patient does not recall the event.  There was major
damage to the vehicle.  In the Emergency Department, the
patient had GCS of 15 with stable vitals.  The patient was
intubated, secondary to agitation, for airway protection.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Premature birth with biventricular
shunts for grade 3 intraventricular hemorrhage at birth, left
occipital encephalomalacia, bronchopulmonary dysplasia status
post pericardial drainage, as a baby, for fluid in the
pericardial sac, right retinal detachment with placement of
an artificial right eye.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Ventolin.

ALLERGIES:
1. Latex.
2. Penicillin.
3. Vancomycin.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Temperature 97.4, pulse
110, blood pressure 120/70.
GENERAL:  The patient was an obese male, agitated prior to
intubation.
LEFT EYE:  Pupil was reactive.
RIGHT EYE:  Glass prosthetic eye.
CHEST:  Clear to auscultation with decreased breath sounds on
the left.
HEART:  Regular rate and rhythm.
ABDOMEN:  Soft, nontender, nondistended.
EXTREMITIES:  Left knee with deformity.  Pulses were
dopplerable bilaterally.
BACK:  No stepoffs or deformities.  ABIs were 0.9
bilaterally.

LABS:  White count 20, crit 40.  Electrolytes all normal.
ABG normal.  Head CT showed a chronic subdural bleed on the
left with a possible acute component on the left side.  A CT
torso showed sacral fracture, C7 through T2, and T6 through 7
spinous process fractures, bilateral pulmonary contusions.
CT of his L-spine was negative.  MRI of his C-spine was
negative.  The patient also had an echo done on hospital day
#1 showing no pericardial effusion and normal LV function.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Neurosurgery was consulted for subdural
hemorrhage, and ortho was consulted for management of his
spine fractures and his extremity deformity.  The patient was
placed in the ICU with frequent neuro checks and repeat CAT
scans serially.  The patient's CAT scan was followed with no
significant change.  The patient's left lower extremity was
reduced and splinted with ortho.  The patient was difficult
to wean from the ventilator, and a pulmonary consult was
obtained, given that the patient had a history of
bronchopulmonary dysplasia.

On [**12-5**], the patient went to the operating room for repair
of his PCL tear on the left knee.  The patient was placed in
bilateral knee immobilizers.  The patient was finally weaned
from the ventilator and extubated on [**2191-12-9**].  For DVT
prophylaxis, the patient had a temporary IVC filter placed,
after several serial head CAT scans noted stable, likely
chronic subdural hematoma.  The patient's filter was removed
on [**12-13**], and the patient was started on Lovenox for DVT
prophylaxis.

The patient was transferred to the floor on [**2191-12-11**].  The
patient was agitated on the floor and required ativan for
anxiety.  The patient was discharged to rehab in good
condition.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1. Left knee posterior ligament tear.
2. Right knee ligamentous injury.
3. Subdural hematoma.
4. Pulmonary contusions.
5. Sacral fracture.
6. C7 through C2, and T6 through 7 spinous process fractures.

FOLLOW-UP:  The patient is to follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 284**]
in 2 weeks, ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 33219**].  Follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 363**] in 2
weeks, ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 11061**].  Follow-up with Trauma Clinic only as
needed, ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 376**].  The patient will need an outpatient
MRI for definitive management of the right knee injury.  The
patient is to remain nonweightbearing on both lower
extremities, on the left secondary to the PCL tear, and on
the right secondary to the sacral fracture.

Finally, the patient was further evaluated by the spine
service on [**2191-12-12**], and it was determined that the patient
did not need to remain in a C-collar with thoracic extension
any longer.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1. Albuterol 1-2 puffs q 6 h prn.
2. Clonidine 0.1 mg patch q weekly transdermal.
3. Docusate 100 mg [**Hospital1 **].
4. Bisacodyl 2 tablets 5 mg po qd prn.
5. Percocet 1-2 mg po q 4-6 h.
6. Ativan 1 mg po q 6 h prn anxiety and agitation.
7. Lovenox 30 mg po bid.
8. Famotidine 20 mg po bid.
