Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 110371**] was admitted on [**2144-5-11**] to the trauma SICU for
close observation given his diagnosis of perforated
diverticulitis and free air seen on CT scan. He did not have
evidence of peritoneal signs on exam and was only moderately
tender. He was kept NPO and aggressively resuscitated. He was
also started on IV cipro/flagyl. His heart rate in the ICU was
poorly controlled in the setting of atrial fibrillation. This
improved with diltiazem and on HD 2 he was restarted on his home
doses of sotalol and digoxin. Overall he did well in the ICU
with improved abdominal exam so was transferred to the floor on
[**5-12**].

On the floor he was monitored on telemetery and he remained in
atrial fibrillation with rate well controlled. His vital signs
were routinely monitored and he remained afebrile and
hemodynamically stable. His oxygen saturation decreased to the
80's on room air but was in the mid to high 90's on minimal
supplemental O2 via nasal cannula. Pulmonary toilet and
incentive spirometry were encouraged and he was started on
nebulizer treatments. A chest x-ray on [**5-12**] showed significant
improvement with only minimal residual signs of CHF. I&O's were
monitored and he was voiding adequate amounts of urine. He was
started on SC heparin for DVT prophylaxis. His blood glucose was
monitored and he required very minimal coverage with insulin
sliding scale, with his blood sugars remaining in the 100's
throughout his hospital stay.

His abdominal exams were monitored serially and improved over
the the 3 days that he was on the floor. His tenderness had
decreased significantly and his WBC count trended downward from
its peak at 18.1 on admission to 11.8 at discharge on [**5-15**]. He
had a large bowel movement on [**5-14**] and his diet was slowly
advanced over 24 hours to regular which he tolerated without
increased abdominal pain or nausea. He was continued on the
cipro/flagyl and discharged to rehab on [**5-15**] to complete a total
2 week course. Follow up was scheduled in [**Hospital 2536**] clinic prior to
discharge.
