Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 30**]
Chief Complaint:
Failed extubation

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Extubation

History of Present Illness:
52 year old female with HTN, DM, COPD, Sleep Apnea who was
transferred from an OSH for a 2nd opinion s/p failed extubation
[**12-29**] vocal cord edema.  Ms. [**Known lastname 2470**] initially presented to [**Hospital **] on [**7-14**] with lethargy and decreased
responsiveness at home.  At [**Hospital3 15402**], patient had temp 105.3
and was hypotensive and was presumed to be septic.  Family
requested transfer to [**Hospital1 **] for further workup.  At
[**Hospital1 **], patient was hypoxic, tachycardic, WBC 18.1,
32% bands.  CXR from [**Hospital3 15402**] had ?infiltrate and patient was
started on Vancomycin/Levo for presumed PNA.  CXR on [**2154-7-15**] at
[**Location (un) **] showed clear lung fieds per report.  On [**2154-7-16**] patient
went into respiratory distress.  ABG showed pH 7.16, pCO2 78,
pO2 73.  She was transferred to the ICU and intubated for
respiratory failure.  She was extubated on [**2154-7-21**] and became
stridorous 5min  s/p extubation.  Pulmonologist was called and
concern was for vocal cord edema.  20mg of Etomidate was given
and patient was reintubated with 7 [**11-28**] ETT.  On exam, patient
was noted to have bilateral swelling of her vocal cords.  ETT
tube was passed through vocal cords with difficulty [**12-29**] to
edema.  Patient was treated with steroids for 3 days and plan
was for extubation in the OR with ENT monitoring for possible
tracheostomy.  Family and patient refused tracheostomy as an
option and requested transfer to [**Hospital1 18**] for 2nd opinion and
further evaluation.

On arrival patient was intubated and sedated and unable to
answer questions

ECHOCARDIOGRAM [**2154-8-1**]
Findings
LEFT ATRIUM: Mild LA enlargement.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Mild symmetric LVH with normal cavity size and
regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Mildly dilated RV cavity. Normal RV systolic
function.

AORTA: Normal diameter of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch
levels.

AORTIC VALVE: Three aortic valve leaflets. Moderately thickened
aortic valve leaflets. Mild AS (AoVA 1.2-1.9cm2). Trace AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. Mild
mitral annular calcification. Trivial MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets. Mild [1+] TR.
Moderate PA systolic hypertension.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Pulmonic valve not visualized.
No PS. Physiologic PR.

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.
.
Conclusions
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and
regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). The right
ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with normal free wall
contractility. There are three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic
valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is mild aortic
valve stenosis (area 1.2-1.9cm2). Trace aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial
mitral regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
.
IMPRESSION: Mild calcific aortic stenosis. Mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global and regional
systolic function. Dilated right ventricle with preserved
systolic function. Moderate pulmonary hypertension.


Brief Hospital Course:
Patient was transferred from outside hospital and where she was
treated there for sepsis, pneumonia and resp failure.  She was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for a second opinion after failed
extubation at the outside hospital secondary to laryngeal edema.
 The patient was afebrile and without other signs of infection
during this admission.  The patient was treated with steroids
for 3 days.  The patient was were successfuly extubated in the
ICU with the interventional pulmonary team monitoring you at
bedside on the morning of [**7-29**].  The patient did not
require any further interventions.  The patient was then
monitored and transferred out of the ICU.  The patient now
reports that her breathing was better than it was before she got
sick.
.
The patient has been using a CPAP machine for obstructive sleep
apnea while in the hospital.  Although she had a sleep study in
the past, you did not have a CPAP machine at home.  We obtained
the sleep study records from [**Hospital6 **] and have written
a prescription for the patient to get a CPAP machine at home.
The patient was given instructions on what company to contact to
obtain the CPAP.  We recommend the patient use this machine
every night while while sleeping.  The patient was instructed to
follow up with her PCP if she has difficulty obtaining the CPAP.

.
The patient was evaluated by cardiology for a slow heart rate
and found to have sinus bradycardia.  Our Cardiologists felt
that the patient did not require treatment for this condition as
she is asymptomatic and her heart rate increases appropriately
in response to stress.
.
In addition, the patient's heart murmur was evaluated with
echocardiogram and the patient was found to have mild aortic
stenosis.  This condition will need to be followed by the
patient's primary care doctor.
.
In addition, the patient was constipated during this
hospitalization and was given a script for a stool softener on
discharge.
