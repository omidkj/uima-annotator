History of Present Illness:
Pt is an 80 yo female h/o HTN, osteoporosis, and emphysema who
presents with progressive weight loss, early satiety, hoarseness
and pedal edema. Weight loss was unintentional, documented from
113->97 lbs in about one year. Along with this, she has lost
strength, balance, and energy. No fever/chills/NS. She has also
had early satiety which she describes as wanting to eat a meal,
but stopping short [**2-21**] feeling that it will come up. Yesterday,
for example, she only had a little bit of chicken noodle soup
for dinner. The hoarseness has also been progressing over the
last year, with associated production of white "foam" that she
has been coughing up more frequently with no blood or distinct
colors other than white. Of note, no difficulty swallowing, no
constipation/diarrhea, no melena/BRBPR. She had a recent E. coli
UTI [**2143-8-28**] with hematuria which was treated with Bactrim for 3
days and resolved with f/u UA with no RBCs. Finally, she has
also had gradually increasing pedal edema over the past few
weeks. She has no chest pain, but has dyspnea after walking ~1
block that is stable. ROS otherwise negative except for urinary
stress incontinence that she has had for years which is stable.

Pertinent Results:
Admit WBC 7.9, hgb 11, plt 247.
.
Na 139, K 4.1, Cl 102, bicarb 30, BUN 24, Cr 0.8
.
SPEP: no monoclonal spike. hypogammaglobulinemic at IgG 461* IgA
55* IgM 57 .
Admission CXR: severe cardiomegaly; kyphoscoliosis
.
STUDIES:
.
Laryngoscopy: no vocal cord paralysis, no mass, presbylaryngis
and signs of pharyngeal/laryngeal reflux.
.
CT torso: [**2143-9-18**]:
1. Right apical 2-cm mass, consistent with appearance of
carcinoma.
2. Bilateral pleural effusions, with adjacent atelectasis in
both lower lobes.
3. Small left liver lobe as well as dilated intrahepatic bile
ducts.
4. 37 x 29 mm nonenhancing structure in the left liver lobe, not
present on the MR study of [**2143-4-20**]. The differential
diagnosis includes hematoma and pseudocyst.
5. Free pelvic fluid.
.
[**9-16**] eccho: There is a large pericardial effusion. The effusion
appears circumferential. There is right ventricular diastolic
collapse, consistent with impaired fillling/tamponade
physiology.
.
CXR [**9-18**]: Mild pulmonary edema has improved. Left lower lobe
atelectasis and small left pleural effusion have worsened.
A small collection of pleural air at the base of the right lung
is stable. No pneumothorax is seen elsewhere.
.
Echo [**9-18**]: There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy
with normal cavity size and systolic function (LVEF>55%). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is a small
to moderate sized pericardial effusion most prominent
inferolateral to the left ventricle, but also circumferential.
There is no 2D echocardiographic evidence for tamponade
physiology.
.

EKG: NSR @ 93, borderline RAD, nl intervals, low voltages, no
ischemic changes.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms [**Known lastname 1104**] is an 80 yo F with h/o HTN and COPD who presented with
failure to thrive, hoarseness, and peripheral edema.  She had
recently had a negative malignancy work-up including mammogram,
colonoscopy, EGD, pap smear, and CT chest abdomen and pelvis
within the preceding 6 months.  She was initially admitted to
facilitate further workup for these problems with plans for a
laryngoscopy, gastric emptying study, and ecchocardiogram.
.
# Hoarseness - Laryngoscopy revealed presbylaryngis (failure of
the vocal cords to completely collapse) and inflammation
suggestive of pharyngeal/laryngeal reflux without any evidence
for cancer or vocal cord paralysis.  She was started on [**Hospital1 **] PPI
treatment with some improvement in her voice.  She should
receive vocal therapy on dishcarge.
.
# Pericardial effusion - patient was found to have new murmur
initially and on subsequently Echo she was found to have a large
circumferential pericardial effusion with tamponade physiology.
She was clinically stable on the floor with 8-10 pulsus pardoxus
and cardiology service was consulted. The effusion was likely
deemed to be chronic since she was tolerating it without
hemodynamic instability.  It was decided that she would benifit
from fluid drainage for symptomatic relief, and also to
facilitate workup for the cause of her effusion and FTT.  She
was transferred to the CCU and underwent pericardiocentesis in
the cath lab with 450cc drained. Opening pressure was 15,
pericardium was thickened. CO 3.14, CI 2.32, mean RA 11, mean
PCW 12. The procedure was complicated by hypotension, which
responded to atropine. This was attributed to the drainage of
500cc of bloody fluid, suspected from a venous structure, likely
the azygous or splenic vein. Post-procedure echo confirmed
evacuation of fluid. She was then transferred to the CCU for
further care and monitoring. The pericardial drain was
discontinued and she transfered from CCU back to the floor.
Repeat eccho the next day on [**9-20**] continued to show no
reaccumulation of fluid.  She continued to remain
hemodynamically stable on the floor and was monitored on
telemetry without evidence of tachycardia.  She has not had
clinical evidence of fluid reaccumulation, however this is very
likely to recurr and she should be seen by cardiology within a
month (Dr.[**Name (NI) 94146**] saw her at [**Hospital1 18**])
.
With regard to the etiology of her pericardial effusion clinical
suspicion was very high for malignancy, especially considering
her extensive smoking history.  A chest CT revealed a 2cm
spiculated RUL lung mass.  Additionally pericardial fluid was +
for CEA+ malignant-appearing cells.  Otherwise, her PPD was
negative, ESR nl, she had no uremia.
.
# Right Apical Mass: CT this admission showed 2cm right apical
mass concerning for malignancy. She has a h/o smoking and
otherwise negative malignancy work up (including colonoscopy,
EGD, pap, ma
