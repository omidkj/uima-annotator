Chief Complaint:
lower extremity weakness

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
HPI: This is a 73 yo female with multiple medical problems
including CRI, cervical spondylosis, and L sciatica x10 yrs who
presents with complaints of worsening lower extremity weakness.
The pt states that she was able to stand and walk with a walker
until today when she was getting into the car and collapsed. She
has noted that in the past several days her knees have been
buckling and she has nearly fallen. She has also noted increased
lower back pain over the past several weeks. The pt has had a
gradual decline in mobility over recent months. She thinks she
has had increased lower extremity weakness while being treated
for a urinary tract infection. The pt admits to numbness down
her L leg into her foot x 10 yrs and partly into her R leg as
well. She also has some numbness in her upper extremities
(mostly in her hands) which is stable for years. She admits to
some baseline UE weakness. She does not have urinary retention
but does admit to urinary incontinence and wears pads (this is
baseline). She is unsure if she has fecal incontinence since she
has an ileostomy. She admits to poor appetite and eats only [**2-6**]
meals/day. She limits how much she drinks since she has dysuria
related to her UTI. She has had less energy and has been
sleeping more over the past several weeks. The pt denies f/c s,
CP, SOB, dizziness.
.
In the ED, the pts vitals were: T 97.5 P 60 BP 144/55 R 18 Sat
96%RA. EKG revealed NSR, LAD, inverted T in III, Q in III, and
upright T waves in anterior leads (this is similar to [**8-8**] EKG
but changed from [**2-10**] EKG in which there were TWI in I, AVL, and
anterior leads, and T was upright in III). The pt was noted to
have 5/5 strength on dorsi/ plantar flexion bilaterally, but [**3-11**]
strength on hip flexion bilaterally. She had no saddle
anesthesia and had good rectal tone. Neurology was consulted and
recommended L spine/C spine. While at MRI, the pts K returned at
7.2 without peaked T waves on EKG. MRI was not completed and the
pt was given Insulin 10 U IV x1, 1 amp D50, 1 amp NaHCO3, and 30
gram of Kayexalate. Her glucose dropped to 50 so the pt received
another amp of D50. The pt was also found to have a continued
urinary tract infection on UA, so she was given Levofloxacin 500
mg po x1. Prior to transfer to the floor, the pts K was down to
6.0.
.
ROS: The pt denies n/v, CP, SOB. She has some baseline DOE which
has not worsened. She denies dizziness/lightheadedness. She has
had a chronic UTI for nearly 8 mos treated with a variety of abx
including levoflox, bactrim, without relief. Per husband, pt has
poor hygiene after cleaning her ostomy and he thinks this is why
she has UTIs. She c/o occ palpitations at night. She has chronic
nausea, but no emesis.

Studies:
.
EKG: NSR, LAD, inverted T in III, Q in III, and upright T waves
in anterior leads (this is similar to [**8-8**] EKG but changed from
[**2-10**] EKG in which there were TWI in I, AVL, and anterior leads,
and T was upright in III). Thus, pt has pseudonormalization of T
waves from [**2-10**].
.
A/P: 73 yo female with multiple medical problems including CRI,
cervical spondylosis, and L sciatica x10 yrs presents with
complaints of worsening lower extremity weakness resulting in
mechanical fall. She has had a functional decline over several
weeks/months as well.
.
#Lower Extremity Weakness (and mild upper extremity): 73 yo
female with multiple medical problems including CRI, cervical
spondylosis, and L sciatica x10 yrs who presents with complaints
of worsening lower extremity weakness. The pt has 2 conditions
which could explain her acute decline: UTI and hyperkalemia. One
of the first manifestations of significantly elevated potassium
is diffuse weakness. In addition, the pt has had LE weakness for
years, which seems to be related to sacral/lumbar radiculopathy.
With the worsening and progressive symptoms, however, cord
compression is also of concern. She has no saddle anesthesia and
has good rectal tone, making conus medullaris syndrome less
likely. She also has downgoing toes, decreased LE sensation, and
absent reflexes in her LE, arguing for peripheral nerve
impingement or a cauda equina syndrome. Similarly, pt has UE
weakness, likely due to nerve impingement as well.
--treat elevated K as per below
--PT consult (pt likely needs acute rehab)
--treat UTI as per below
--order MRI C/L spine to r/o cord impingement/compression, root
impingement
--Work up for secondary causes of peripheral neuropathy
including HbA1c, TSH, SPEP and UPEP, RPR and Lyme serology.
--Neurology following, appreciate input
--oxycodone/tylenol prn back pain
.
#ARF: The pts BL Cr is 1.7-2.1. She has a h/o ARF in the past in
the setting of dehydration. The pt has not been drinking much
fluids at home which could explain a hypovolemic component. In
addition, the pt has been on bactrim which could lead to an
interstitial nephritis (although pt has no peripheral
eosinophilia). Pt received 2 L NS in the ED.
--check urine lytes
--renally dose levofloxacin and allopurinol
--hold diovan
--give 1 more L NS
--check urine eos
.
#UTI: Pt has dirty UA. Pt has frequently grown Klebsiella in the
past, pansensitive to all but nitrofurantoin. Pt may have poor
hygiene leading to recurrence as stated in HPI.
--ostomy hygiene discussed with pt
--treat with 14 day course of levofloxacin
--f/u Urine cx

#Hyperkalemia: This is likely related to p
