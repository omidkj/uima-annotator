Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 174**] is a [**Age over 90 **] year old male with CHF AD, CAD, s/p fall at
nursing home now with spiral fracture of the distal femur.

Fall: Mr. [**Known lastname 174**] had a witnessed fall in his nursing home which
resulted in a spiral fracture.  He was admitted to medicine for
cardiac pre operative risk evaluation for ORIF of the left
femur.  The patient was evaluated to be Class III (see below for
details) and after a discussion with his son who felt it would
be beneficial, he went for surgery.  By report the patient
underwent uncomplicated fixation and repair of his left femur.
The initial blood loss estimate was 300cc, however, in the OR
the patient developed hypotension with systolics in the 80s,
resulting in an 800cc fluid bolus and the initiation of
neosynephrine.  He was transferred to the PACU on neosynephrine,
which could not be weaned despite transfusion of 2U PRBC.  The
post-transfusion hct was 27 (pre-op 30).  CXR at the time showed
only mild worsening of R basilar opacity.  ECG revealed a paced
rhythm without obvious signs of ischemia.  The patient was
transferred to the SICU for further monitoring and volume
repletion.  Immediately post-operatively the patient had a drop
in his hematocrit and became hypotensive.  He received 2 units
with no resultant bump in his hematocrit and no improvement in
blood pressures.  He was started on neosynephrine in the PACU
and transferred to the SICU.  The patient remained hypotensive
in the SICU, requiring neosynephrine support until [**6-24**] am.
During his time in the SICU, the patient received an additional
unit of PRBCs on [**6-22**] without a change in hematocrit level and an
additional unit on [**6-23**], again without a response in his
hematocrit.  The patient received an additional 2U packed RBCs
on [**6-24**] with an appropriate increase in hematocrit and one stable
hematocrit approximately 3 hours later.  The patient's SICU
course was complicated by a low grade fever on the night of [**6-23**]
and ongoing hypoxia, requiring 2L nasal cannula.  A CXR showed a
large right pleural effusion which had increased substantially,
stable moderate cardiomegaly with a clear left lung.  In a
discussion with the patient's son, it was decided that as the
patient would be unable to cooperate with a thoracentesis, the
procedure would entail too much risk for the patient.  On the
floor, he remained hemodynamically stable.  His wounds remain
clean, dry and intact with no evidence of increasing hematoma or
blood loss.  His hematocrit remained stable and his left knee is
immobilized.  His pain was treated with acetaminophen and
oxycodone.  PT saw the patient and felt that he would benefit
from a rehabilitation center.
.
CAD: As Mr. [**Known lastname 174**] was admitted with a femoral fracture which is
optimally treated with surgery, he needed medical evaluation for
risk related to the surgery.  According to the [**Doctor Last Name **] criteria
for general surgery, the patient receives 15 points (Age>70
5pts, significant AS 3pts, rhythm other than sinus on preop ECG
7) which makes him Class III and gives him an 86% of none/minor
complications, 11% of serious complications, and 2% risk of
cardiac death.  The patient has a history of AS and +murmur on
exam, however no ECHO on record.  As ECHO will not likely change
management (valve replacement, etc) given a patient with already
high risk factors, no ECHO was ordered.  His lasix and ace
inhibitor were held on admission.  He was placed on a beta
blocker both pre and post operatively.  Immediately post
operatively the patient became hypotensive (as above) and the
beta blocker was held temporarily.  However, once his blood
pressure stabilized he was restarted on his beta blocker given
the mortality benefit in the peri-operative period.  His beta
blocker was titrated up as tolerated.  His ASA was restarted per
ortho and his ACEI will be started upon discharge.  His lasix
was held, however may be restarted at the rehab in [**1-21**] days with
monitoring of his fluid status.
.
Nursing home acquired pneumonia, pleural effusion: Pneumonia is
the likely etiology of fever and elevated WBC as noted in the
SICU. The pneumonia was likely aquired in the setting of fall in
NH.  He was started on a 14 day course of vancomycin and zosyn.
His WBC trended down, he remained afebrile.  The option of
thoracentesis was discussed with the patient's son (health care
proxy) and the decision was made not to tap the effusion (as
above).  A PICC was placed on the floor and the patient will be
continued on antibiotic therapy for 14 days.
.
Glaucoma: Mr. [**Known lastname 174**] was continued on levobunolol and xalatan
drops as per his outpatient regimen.
.
Thrombocytopenia: Mr. [**Known lastname 174**] has a history of low platelets.  On
admission, his platelet co
