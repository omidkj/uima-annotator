Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 783**]
Chief Complaint:
Melena

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
80 y/o French/Creole-speaking female with a hx of GI bleed,
fairly recent diagnosis of HepC cirrhosis c/b grade I esophageal
varices and ascites, who within the 2-3 days prior to admission
had been having SOB and melanotic stools. On presentation the
patient was noted to be lethargic. Her Hct was 32.3. Vitals were
noteworthy for a HR 67, BP 125/47.  The patient was seen in the
ED by hepatology who recommended an EGD with possible intubation
(given the patient's mental status).  The patient's daughter
opted for conservative management, because she was fearful that
the patient may not be able to be extubated.
.
Of note the patient had been recently discharged from [**Hospital1 18**] on
[**2104-1-12**].  Her presenting diagnosis was new ascites. During that
time, she had an EGD which showed grade I varices. Colonoscopy
was limited due to poor prep, but no obvious sites of bleeding
were noted. Hep C VL at that time was noted to be 428K. The
patient was discharged on Nadolol, Lasix, and Spironolactone.

Physical Exam:
V: Tm 97.7 HR 55 BP 127/98 R12 O2sat 100%RA
Gen: elderly female who appears lethargic in NAD
HEENT: no conjunctival pallor, dried blood in nares, MM dry, OP
clear
CV: Normal S1, S2, RRR, II/VI HSM along LUSB
Pulm: CTA-anteriorly

Ext: 2+DP b/l, no cce


Pertinent Results:
CXR [**2103-2-1**]
CHEST AP: Small bilateral pleural effusions are unchanged. Upper
zone redistribution of pulmonary vasculature is seen with hilar
congestion and mild cardiomegaly representing persistent
failure.
.
EKG
Sinus bradycardia at 50bpm, TWF V4-V6 (unchanged from prior),
poor R wave progression (unchanged from prior)
.
ECHO
The left atrium is dilated. The right atrium is moderately
dilated. The estimated right atrial pressure is 11-15mmHg. There
is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. Due to suboptimal technical
quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully
excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF>55%).
Transmitral Doppler and tissue velocity imaging are consistent
with Grade I (mild) LV diastolic dysfunction. There is a mild
resting left ventricular outflow tract obstruction. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is no
aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. No mitral
regurgitation is seen. The left ventricular inflow pattern
suggests impaired relaxation. There is mild
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
effusion. Suboptimal image quality - patient unable to
cooperate.


Brief Hospital Course:
80 year old female with MMP including Hep C, GIB, who presents
with GIB. The following issues were investigated during this
hospitalization:
.
1. GIB: Likely upper GI bleed given melena and probably from
esophageal varices. Daughter elected conservative management out
of fear that once intubated, her mother may not be able to be
extubated. The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit
where she was monitored with serial Hcts and vitals were checked
for hemodynamic instability. The patient remained stable and was
thus transferred to the floor where another conversation was
held with the daughter who fully understood the consequences of
declining an EGD, but still declined. The patient's vitals
remained stable. She was maintained on a PPI and Ciprofloxacin
and once her blood pressure became stable, she was restarted on
Nadolol. She never required a transfusion. She was discharged
with instructions to follow up in [**Company 191**] for Hct monitoring and
additional care.
.
2 HTN: Antihypertensives were initially held given the GIB,
however after being transferred to the floor, the patient was
noted to be hypertensive frequently with SBPs in the 170s. She
was restarted on Amlodipine which she had been taking as an
outpatient. Additionally, Nadolol for the esophageal varices and
Lasix for ascites were added on. Careful attention was paid to
not only the blood pressure but the patient's heart rate while
on these medications as she was noted to have asymptomatic
bradycardia while sleeping. The patient was able to tolerate
them all well and was discharged on her outpatient regimen of
all the aforementioned medications.
.
3. UTI: The patient was noted to have a UTI on urinalysis which
was treated with Levofloxacin. This was continued on discharge
for a total of 14 days, since it was associated with a foley.
.
4. Hep C: Patient with known cirrhosis and grade 1 varices,
viral of 428,000. While patient was admitted previously for
ascites, there was no evidence of ascites on exam during this
hospitalization. Once her blood pressure became stable, she was
restarted on her outpatient dose of Lasix. Otherwise, no active
issues for Hepatitis C during this hospitalization.
.
5. DM2: The patient's diabetes was monitored and treated with
QID fingersticks and an Insulin sliding scale.
.
6. COPD: Patient was maintained on her outpatient dose of
nebulizers/inhalers.
