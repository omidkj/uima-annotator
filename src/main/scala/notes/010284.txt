HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Ms. [**Known lastname 5419**] is an 87 year-old
Russian female with a past medical history significant for
multi infarct dementia, coronary artery disease, diastolic
dysfunction, type 2 diabetes, pacemaker for heart block, deep
venous thrombosis and PE and aspiration of thin liquids who
presented from her nursing home on [**2140-4-23**] after the
caretakers at the nursing home noticed an area of erythema
and tenderness on the patient's left lower concern.  Their
concern was for a cellulitis.  The patient was also noted to
be sleepy more so then her baseline with a decreased room air
saturation.  In the Emergency Department the patient was
afebrile.  She was in no acute distress.  There was an area
on her left lateral upper calf that was erythematous and
slightly warm likely a cellulitis.  The patient was treated
with Ancef 1 gram intravenous.  She was also given Flagyl 500
mg intravenous and Levaquin 500 mg intravenous for question
of an aspiration pneumonia with the patient's history of
aspiration and the drop in room air sats to 89%.  This
saturation improved to 97% on 2 liters.  The patient had a
chest x-ray that was read s fluid in the fissure, but cannot
rule out a retrocardiac infiltrate.  Therefore the patient
was admitted for management of cellulitis and possible
pneumonia.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Multi infarct dementia.  At baseline the patient is not
alert and oriented times three, but is responsive.
2.  Coronary artery disease.
3.  Congestive heart failure, diastolic, last EF from
echocardiogram on [**2140-2-23**] was super normal read as 75 to 80%
with an E to A ratio of 0.55, normal left ventricular wall
thickness.
4.  Diabetes mellitus type 2.
5.  Pacemaker for complete heart block.
6.  Depression.
7.  Status post cataract surgery.
8.  Hypertension.
9.  Diagnosed with deep venous thrombosis and PE in [**2140-2-13**] now on Coumadin.
10.  History of E-coli urinary tract infection resistant to
Levofloxacin.
11.  Pneumonia in [**2140-1-13**] possibly related to
aspiration.
12.  Aspiration of thin liquids.  The patient had a speech
and swallow study on [**2140-1-21**] that was interpreted as
aspiration of thin liquids with the recommendation that the
patient have nectar thick liquids and purees and be
positioned upright for all po intake.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient speaks only Russian.  She lives
in a nursing home and has resided there for at least five
years.  Her son is very involved in her care.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Temperature 96.9.  Pulse
62 and regular.  Blood pressure 118/54.  Respiratory rate 20.
Sat 97% on 2 liters.  In general, the patient was felt to be
ill appearing and in no acute distress, very sleepy, uneasy
to arouse.  HEENT mucous membranes are dry.  Pupils are
equal, round, and reactive to light and accommodation.  Neck
supple.  Lungs clear to auscultation bilaterally with diffuse
expiratory wheezing.  Cardiovascular distant heart sounds, S1
and S2, 2 out of 6 systolic ejection murmur at the right
upper sternal border.  Abdomen soft, obese, nontender,
positive bowel sounds.  Extremities area on the left upper
calf of erythema roughly 2 cm by 2 cm, nonpainful, nontender,
no skin breakdown or open areas.  Neurological sleepy, opens
eyes to commands, otherwise cannot comply well with
neurological examination.  Per records this is the patient's
baseline.

LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION:  White blood cell count 10.5,
hematocrit 33.2, platelets 351, creatinine 1.0, glucose 157,
INR 1.6.

IMAGING:  The patient had a left lower extremity ultrasound,
which showed no evidence of deep venous thrombosis.  Chest
x-ray showed slight obscurating of the left hemidiaphragm
question infiltrate.

IMPRESSION:  This is an 87 year-old Russian only speaking
female with multiple medical problems including dementia,
coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, deep
venous thrombosis and PE presenting with a left leg
cellulitis.

For the patient's cellulitis she was initially continued on
Unasyn with her history of diabetes and a concern for a
complicated infection.  For the question of pneumonia the
patient was not placed on antibiotics as it was felt that she
did not have a pneumonia based on the absence of an elevated
white count, the absence of cough or fever and the absence of
sputum production.  For the patient's recent history of PE
and deep venous thrombosis with an INR of only 1.6 the
patient was continued on Coumadin and also given Lovenox
until her INR was therapeutic.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  1.  Infectious disease:  For the patient's
presumed cellulitis she was treated with Dicloxacillin 250 mg
po q.i.d.  The Unasyn was discontinued as even though the
patient is a diabetic she had no open areas and the
cellulitis appeared very mild and there was no skin
breakdown.  There was improvement in her cellulitis during
her hospital stay with a po Dicloxacillin.  The patient was
ruled out for other etiologies of infection.  The chest x-ray
appeared without infiltrate.  Her urine showed no evidence of
infection.  The patient remained afebrile.

2.  Hematology:  The patient's INR by the morning of hospital
day number two was 2.3, therefore the Lovenox was
discontinued and the patient was continued on Coumadin.

3.  Hypotension:  The patient is on a dosing regimen of Lasix
20 po q 72 hours for her history of diastolic dysfunction.
She was continued on this while in house initially.  On the
evening of [**2140-4-23**] the house staff was called to see the
patient for tachypnea, decreased O2 sats to 88% on room air.
The patient was normotensive at this time.  On physical
examination she was tachypneic with a respiratory rate in the
30s.  She was diaphoretic in appearance with diffuse
expiratory wheezing on lung examination without crackles.  On
examination of her extremities she had 1+ pitting edema.  The
patient was immediately treated with Albuterol and Atrovent
nebulizers multiple times and her wheezing did not respond to
this management.  Therefore it was felt that based on her
examination and her nonresponse to inhalers that she could be
in failure with her history of diastolic dysfunction.  The
patient was treated with 20 of intravenous Lasix times one
and morphine 1 mg intravenous times one with resolution of
her tachypnea and hypoxia.  A blood gas was obtained at this
time with pH of 7.39, PCO2 of 47 and PO2 of 60.  A chest
x-ray showed possible left lower lobe infiltrate and mild
cardiomegaly.  Cardiac enzymes were sent and the patient was
ruled out for myocardial infarction.  Her electrocardiogram
had no changes.  Her electrocardiogram is AV paced.  As the
patient responded to a combination of treatments it was not
entirely clear initially what was the cause of this episode
of hypoxia and tachypnea.  The differential included flash
pulmonary edema or aspiration.

On the morning of [**2140-4-24**] the house staff was called again
to see the patient for a blood pressure of 80/42.  At the
time the patient appeared asymptomatic and was given a fluid
bolus with no response initially.  Her blood pressure then
dropped to 65 to 70 systolic and the patient was started on a
Dopamine drip and intravenous fluids wide open.  She was then
transferred to the CICU for further management.  The patient
required a Dopamine drip for a short time and her blood
pressure responded to fluid administration.  It was felt by
the CICU house staff that the patient likely became
hypotensive after being given the Lasix for the episode of
tachypnea and hypoxia.  She had no signs of septic
physiology.  Blood cultures were negative, repeat chest x-ray
showed no evidence of pneumonia.  The patient was again ruled
out for any cardiac events/myocardial infarct
