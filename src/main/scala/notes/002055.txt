History of Present Illness:
66 yo M with h/o CLL and follicular lymphoma currently receiving
chemotherapy, myasthenia [**Last Name (un) 2902**] (Dx [**2185**]; last flare [**2187**]), and
h/o recent pneumonia, who presented on [**2191-3-3**] with 1 week of
URI sxs, fevers, and worsening SOB. Patient had "pneumonia" in
early [**Month (only) 956**] and was treated with Ceftriaxone and
Levofloxacin. He finished a 10 day course of Azithro yesterday
for URI sx. Yesterday the patient had worsening SOB and cough
productive of clear sputum associated with low grade fevers to
99. Pt reported no chest pain other than pressure with cough, +
chronic back pain, no abdominal pain, no diarrhea or
constipation, no headache. EMS was called this AM and he was
noted to be 87% on RA.
.
In ED T 101.8, respiratory distress, improved to 100% on 100%
NRB. An initial ABG showed 7.44/46/126 on NRB. He received
Cefepime for essential neutropenia, Tylenol, and ativan 1 mg.
.
A CTA was negative for PE but showed diffuse centrilobular
nodules b/l and some consolidation in the RML and LL b/l, c/w
infection or mets.

Pt was improving in terms of oxygenation and weaned to nasal
cannula, but started to have increased tachypnea and tachycardia
and with concern for fatigue in setting of myasthenia [**Last Name (un) 2902**],
NIF was checked and found to be -22 and Vital capacity of 1.2L.
Was intubated for impending respiratory fatigue.

Pt underwent bronch on [**3-3**] with positive AFB smear; no evidence
PCP.

Neurology was consulted with concearn for flare-up of his
Myasthenia [**Last Name (un) **]; Tensilon test was positive; neurology
recommended increase Mestinon from 60TID to 80TID and no
indication for IVIG or plasmaphoresis.

Pt was transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] per onc attending request.

Imaging:

CXR [**3-3**]:
IMPRESSION:
1) Left lower lobe opacity consistent with pneumonia.
2) Proper placement of the NG tube.

CT angio [**3-3**]:
IMPRESSION:
1) No CT evidence of pulmonary embolism.
2) Interval development of innumerable, diffuse, ill-defined
nodules which appear to be in a centrilobular pattern, some of
which are arranged in a tree and [**Male First Name (un) 239**] pattern. These findings are
most suggestive of a small airways atypical infection, such as
fungal, mycobacterial, or mycoplasma.
3) Multifocal areas of consolidation within the right middle
lobe, right lower lobe, left lower lobe, findings which may
represent atelectasis or multifocal infectious process.
4) Slight interval decrease in size of the right middle lobe
pulmonary mass.
5) Stable appearance of bulky axillary, hilar, or mediastinal
lymphadenopathy.
6) Interval resolution of previously seen effusions.

CT head [**3-15**] (noncontrast):
IMPRESSION: No intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect.

EEG [**3-16**]:
IMPRESSION: Abnormal portable EEG due to the slow and
disorganized
background and bursts of generalized slowing. These findings
indicate a
widespread encephalopathic condition affecting both cortical and

subcortical structures. Medications, metabolic disturbances, and

infection are among the most common causes. There were no areas
of
prominent focal slowing, but encephalopathies may obscure focal
findings. There were no epileptiform features. A tachycardia was

noted.


Brief Hospital Course:
1.  Respiratory failure - etiology was multifactorial, due to a
multifocal pneumonia, RSV bronchiolitis, and myasthenia crisis.
Neurology was consulted early, and a tensilon test could not
rule out myasthenia crisis.  Pt was therefore treated with 5
days of IVIG.  In addition, BAL on [**3-3**] eventually revealed RSV,
which was consistent with the tree-in-[**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 239**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 55713**] picture
on chest CT.  He was therefore treated with a 5-day course of
ribavirin, as well as Synagis.  Further, due to his neutropenia,
pt was placed on broad spectrum antibiotics (cefepime as
febrile/neutropenic, doxycycline for atypicals, and vanco for
possibility of MRSA)for his presumed multifocal pneumonia.  On
BAL [**3-3**], a few AFB were noted on concentrated smear; this
proved to be MAC and not thought to be a major player in pt's
respiratory failure.  Pt was intubated in the ED and ventilated;
Over the first 2 weeks of his hospitalization, as the above
treatments proceeded, pt required decreasing amounts of
ventilatory support.  His NIF was measured daily, and increased
to about -27 without increased effort.  Eventually, his mental
status (as detailed below) and ability to manage secretions were
thought to be the major impediments to extubation, he had a
trach placed on [**2191-3-20**]. He did well for a few days off any
ventilatory support, and then on [**2191-3-28**] became hypotensive and
went into hypercarbic respiratory failure.
.
2.  Mental status - After propofol was weaned, pt did not clear
his mental status as predicted: he had intact brainstem function
but could not follow commands and did not move his extremities
spontaneously.  A head CT did not reveal any ac
