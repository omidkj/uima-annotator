CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Ventricular tachycardia.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 60 year old
female with a history of coronary artery disease, status post
questionable myocardial infarction five years ago; peripheral
vascular disease, status post right femoral, anterior tibial
and left femoral popliteal bypass on [**10-19**] and [**10-26**]
respectively here at [**Hospital1 69**].
She was transferred to a rehabilitation on [**2167-11-4**], where she
was noted to become unresponsive at hemodialysis
rehabilitation on Friday, [**2167-11-6**].  CPR was administered at
that time. There was a questionable rhythm and vitals.  The
patient notes feeling sleepy when she had loss of
consciousness but no chest pain, shortness of breath or
diaphoresis.

Mental status returned to baseline after CPR and the patient
was taken to an outside hospital.  An electrocardiogram was
normal.  Troponin were negative.  Hematocrit was 25.  The
patient was transfused one unit of packed red blood cells.
Again today, on [**2167-11-8**], in the morning, the patient had one
episode of monomorphic ventricular tachycardia with no
symptoms, no light headedness, no loss of consciousness, no
chest pain, no shortness of breath.  The patient was bolused
with Lidocaine and noted to have no further ectopy on
Lidocaine.  The patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 346**] for close monitoring.

Here, the patient did not complain of any shortness of breath
or light headedness.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Peripheral vascular disease.  Status
post left femoral popliteal bypass, [**2167-10-26**].  Status post
right femoral proximal anterior tibial bypass, [**2167-10-19**],
complicated by Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus,
gangrene and Clostridium difficile colitis.  ESRD, secondary
to noninsulin dependent diabetes mellitus.  She is status
post renal transplant in [**2160**] which failed and is back on
hemodialysis.  Cerebrovascular accident and toxic
encephalopathy. History of upper gastrointestinal bleed,
lower gastrointestinal bleed.  Asthma.  Insulin dependent
diabetes mellitus.  History of deep vein thrombosis with an
inferior vena cava filter.  History of esophageal stricture,
status post dilatation.  Positive Clostridium difficile.
Positive Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
Glaucoma.  Questionable myocardial infarction five years ago.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives with her husband in
[**Name (NI) **] Port.  No tobacco, no alcohol, former R.N.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission, the patient was
afebrile; blood pressure was 134/92; heart rate 82;
respiratory rate 16; saturating 95% on room air.  In general,
she is well appearing, African-American female, with slight
anxiety.  HEAD, EYES, EARS, NOSE AND THROAT:  Pupils are
equal, round, and reactive to light and accommodation.
Oropharynx clear.  Mucous membranes moist.  Neck:  Left
internal jugular TLC; site of CDI; no JVP.  Chest: Clear to
auscultation anteriorly.  Cardiovascular:  S1 and S2 normal.
No murmurs, gallops or rubs. Regular rate.  Abdomen: Soft,
nontender, nondistended, positive bowel sounds.  Extremities:
Left lower extremity with staples clean, dry and intact.
Left toe amputated.  Right lower extremity:  Necrotic second
through fifth toes, no pulses.  Neurology:  Awake, alert and
oriented times three.

LABORATORY DATA:  Potassium of 3.6; creatinine 3.1, baseline
being 2.9 to 3.3.  Albumin was 2.1.  CBC was stable.

Electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia at 102.  Left
ventricular hypertrophy with a strained pattern and left axis
with Q's in 2, 3 and poor R progression.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  1.) Cardiovascular issues:  Ventricular
tachycardia.  The patient's enzymes were cycled times three
and were negative for any ischemic changes. The patient also
did not complain of any chest pain throughout this
hospitalization.  The patient had a cardiac catheterization
during this admission for questionable ischemic cause of her
ventricular tachycardia which revealed two vessel coronary
artery disease with her proximal right coronary artery
diffusely diseased, mid right coronary artery 100% stenosed,
proximal left anterior descending 30%, distal circumflex
100%, obtuse marginal one 70%, with an elevated LVEDP of 16.
However, no intervention was performed, secondary to
difficulty of access for her right radial.  Her groin was not
accessed secondary to her peripheral vascular disease and
recent femoral-popliteal and proximal anterior tibial
bypasses.  However, it was felt that her coronary artery
disease was not responsible to cause her sustained
monomorphic VT episode at the outside hospital.  EP
was consulted and they felt that optimally, they would prefer
an EP study and possible ventricular tachycardia ablation;
however, her present vascular access issues precluded any
studies.  Therefore, the decision was made to start her on
Amiodarone 400 mg twice a day for seven days and then 400 q.
day for a month and then 200 mg q. day thereafter.  The
patient will also be discharged with [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] of Hearts monitor
for daily transmission.  Finally, the patient is to follow-up
with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1911**] in one to three months.

Additionally, for cardiac issues, an echocardiogram was
performed in the hospital. Her ejection fraction was greater
than 65%.  She showed patterns of hypertrophic non
obstructive cardiomyopathy with the left atrium mildly
dilated and severe symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Additionally, the patient was initially placed on a Lidocaine
drip which was discontinued on hospital day number one.  The
patient had a few episodes of non sustained monomorphic
ventricular tachycardia throughout the hospitalization,
without the Lidocaine drip.  The patient again will be
closely followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1911**] and with [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] of Hearts
monitor, with daily transmissions.  The patient was continued
on aspirin, a statin, and increasing doses of her beta
blocker throughout this hospitalization.

2.) Peripheral vascular disease:  The patient is status post
left femoral popliteal bypass and right femoral proximal
anterior tibial bypass. Vascular surgery was following her
throughout this hospitalization and recommended to continue
her antibiotics, including Linezolid, Flagyl and Levofloxacin
for two weeks.  Levofloxacin was discontinued and Ceftriaxone
was started in place because of a risk of prolonged QT
interval, predisposing her to more ventricular tachycardia.
Therefore, on discharge, the patient has another seven days
of Linezolid, Flagyl and Keflex to finish.  Vascular surgery
recommended not accessing any groin grafts at this time, due
to recent bypass surgery.

3.) Renal:  The patient is status post failed renal
transplant on hemodialysis. The renal team was consulted and
the patient was dialyzed every Tuesday, Thursday and
Saturday. Additionally, Prednisone was continued 7.5 mg q.
day for failed renal transplant.

4.) Hematology: The patient has anemia of chronic disease.
The patient will be started on Erythropoietin three times a
week only during her dialysis sessions.

5.) Insulin dependent diabetes mellitus:  The patient was
originally on Lentis 14 units q h.s. However, due to
increasing sugar levels, her Lentis was increased from 14 to
16, with adequate blood sugar levels.  The patient will need
to be closely followed for insulin dependent diabetes
mellitus as an outpatient.

6.) Gastrointestinal:  The patient has a history of
gastrointestinal bleeds.  The patient had several hematocrits
throughout this hospitalization.  Protonic was continued.

7.) Pro
