.
[**2175-9-25**]: ECG:
Sinus rhythm. Indeterminate axis. Low limb lead QRS voltage. Low

inferolateral lead T wave amplitude. Findings are non-specific.
Since the
previous tracing of [**2175-7-4**] ventricular ectopy is absent and
precordial
lead T wave changes appear decreased.
.
[**2175-9-27**]: Duodenal Mucosal Biopsy:
1.  Chronic duodenitis with gastric surface mucous metaplasia.
2.  Normal villous pattern.  No shortening or increased
intraepithelial lymphocytes are seen.
.
[**2175-9-27**]: Upper Endoscopy:
#Esophagus:
Lumen: A sliding small size hiatal hernia was seen. No
esophagitis noted.
#Stomach:
 Excavated Lesions A single non-bleeding erosion was noted in
the pylorus.
#Duodenum:
 Mucosa: Diffuse continuous nodularity, scalloping, and mosaic
appearance of the mucosa with no bleeding and scalloping folds
were noted in the whole examined duodenum compatible with Celiac
disease. Cold forceps biopsies were performed for histology at
the duodenum.
.
Impression:
Small hiatal hernia
Erosion in the pylorus
Nodularity, scalloping, and mosaic appearance in the whole
examined duodenum compatible with Celiac disease (biopsy)
Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum
.
[**2175-9-27**]: Colonscopy:
Findings:
-Flat Lesions A few angioectasias that were not bleeding were
seen in the cecum.
-Excavated Lesions Several non-bleeding diverticula were seen in
the descending colon and sigmoid colon.
.
Impression:
Angioectasias in the cecum
Diverticulosis of the descending colon and sigmoid colon
Otherwise normal colonoscopy to cecum


Brief Hospital Course:
#Anemia: was likely the cause of her dizziness and fatigue. Iron
studies and MCV were consistent with iron deficiency likely [**2-28**]
chronic blood loss. Haptoglobin, LDH, Tbili, Dbili were normal
and were not consistent with hemolysis. Lactate was normal and
not consistent with bowel ischemia. In the MICU she was
transfused 3 units of blood. Her hematocrit trended from 17->
28.3->27.5. On transfer to the floor, vital signs were stable
and she showed no signs of ongoing bleeding. Stool gauic was
positive.
.
#. H/O DVT: Pt had DVT in [**4-5**] after l first toe amputation. Had
been on coumadin tx for anti-coagulation. INR on admission was 4
and was reversed to 2 with vitamin K. Patient has had 4 months
of anti-coagulation and risks of further treatment outweigh the
benefits.
.
#. DM: Her home metformin was held while inpatient but was
restarted on discharge. She was given a diabetic diet and
fingersticks were checked QID FS and she was given humalog
insulin sliding scale
.
#. HYPONATREMIA: As low as 131, normalized over the admission.
Was likely secondary to fluid administration.
.
#. COPD asthma:
-continued on albuterol neb prn for asthma
.
#. HTN:  At first , her home atenolol, diovan and HCTZ were held
in the setting of hypotension and possible GI bleed. She was
discharged on atenolol 25 mg once a day (prior dose was 50 mg po
qD) and valsartan 80 mg po BID. Her hydrochlorothiazide was
stopped.
.
#. HYPERLIPIDEMIA: She was continued on  simvastatin 40 mg QD,
fish oil.
.
#. ANXIETY/DEPRESSION:  She was continued on home cymbalta 30 mg
[**Hospital1 **].
