CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Lower GI bleed and cramps.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This 78-year-old female with
clots in her bowel movements at night.  She called EMS
secondary to weakness.  Patient was found to be lightheaded
with a blood pressure of 90/palp.  Patient denies any melena,
but does admit to some nausea and vomiting tonight.  The
patient does not recall any hematemesis, history of GI bleed
or abnormal EGD/colonoscopy in the past year.

Patient denies any chest pain, shortness of breath,
palpitations, or loss of consciousness.  She denies any
symptoms or exposure to food that would be consistent with
colitis.  She says that her normal stool is a light beige
color.  After 1.5 liters of normal saline, her heart rate was
104 and blood pressure was 95/50.  Patient was called by the
Medical ICU to evaluate for GI bleeding and low blood
pressure.

While in the emergency room, the patient received Protonix,
one unit packed red blood cells, FSP times two, two liters
normal saline and one gram of Ceftriaxone.

Once patient was transferred from the ICU to the Medical
Floor on [**2192-12-15**], she had received four units of packed red
blood cells and four units of FSP for her GI bleeding.
Patient was also given vitamin K to reverse her INR of 55
while her Coumadin was held.

ALLERGIES:  None.

MEDICATIONS:
1.  Coumadin 5 mg p.o. q.h.s.
2.  Verapamil one pill.
3.  Ativan.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Aortic valve replacement in [**2186**].
2.  Right lower lobectomy for a lung cancer five years ago.
3.  Ectopic pregnancy.
4.  Breast cancer with lumpectomy in [**2181**].
5.  Bilateral carotid bruits.
6.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  She smokes half a pack a day for the past 60
years.  She is still currently smoking, but denies any
alcohol use.

FAMILY HISTORY:  There is no history of colon cancer or
coronary artery disease.  There is a sister with congestive
heart failure.  Family history also includes carcinoma.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vitals on admission showed a
temperature of 98.1 F, pulse 104, blood pressure 90/60 to
105/55, respiratory 18, 100% on four liters and 92% on room
air.  Generally this is an elderly female in no acute
distress.  Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat:  Anicteric
eyes.  Pupils are equal, round and reactive to light and
accommodation and extraocular muscles are intact.  Bruise on
the right neck.  Neck is supple without lymphadenopathy.
Cardiovascular:  Regular rate and rhythm.  Normal S1, S2.
There is a III/VI systolic ejection murmur.  Chest:
Decreased breath sounds and some wheezes on the expiratory
phase.  Abdomen:  There are some bowel sounds.  It is
nontender, nondistended with no organomegaly.  Extremities:
No cyanosis, clubbing or edema noted.  Neurologically intact.

LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION:  White count 23.6, hematocrit
27.9, platelets 410.  Sodium 139, potassium 5, chloride 101,
bicarbonate 21, 39 for BUN, 1.2 creatinine, 144 for glucose.
INR is 54.

Chest x-ray shows some postsurgical changes with questionable
right pleural effusion.

EKG is with a heart rate of 104 at sinus tachycardia, normal
axis.  Some ST-T wave changes in II, aVF, V2 through V6.
There is some increased voltage between V3 to V5.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  GASTROINTESTINAL:  For her GI bleed, she received four
units of packed red blood cells and her hematocrit increased
to 32.4.  It remained stable at this level.  She was also
given a Proton pump inhibitor.  Patient also had signs of
cholecystosis on physical examination where patient started
to become jaundice and on lab exams with ALT in the 70s, ASTs
in the 100s, alkaline phosphatase in the 600s, and total
bilirubin in the 10s.  She was given Levaquin, Vancomycin and
Flagyl for possible cholangitis.

Work up for the cholecystosis included a CT Scan of the
abdomen which revealed a distended gallbladder, marked intra
and extrahepatic duct dilatation, common bile duct and
pancreatic duct dilatation, normal pancreas.  This lead to a
ERCP which revealed a bleeding pancreatic mass in the
duodenum with pancreatic duct and common bile duct
dilatation.  These findings were reinforced by an EGD that
was sent for the GI bleeding that revealed a duodenal
papillary mass.

During the first ERCP, her duodenal papillary was stented
with a plastic stent.  Later on a second ERCP
was done to place a metallic stent instead.  A CTA of the
pancreas was then done revealing a 3 by 3.5 pancreatic mass
with liver lesions and intrahepatic duct dilatation.  Biopsy
from the first ERCP revealed an adenocarcinoma.  Further
staining revealed that this was indeed a primary pancreatic
adenocarcinoma.

After stenting was placed, ALT then went back down to 52, AST
went back down to 69, alkaline phosphatase went back down to
498 and total bilirubin went back down to 4.2.  Patient also
became progressively less jaundice.

A CEA level was checked and found to be at 9.8.  A CA99
levels were checked and are still pending upon discharge.
Patient was seen by both Hospice and Oncology in the
hospital.  She is to follow up with Oncology on [**2193-1-3**] with
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 150**].

2.  CARDIOVASCULAR:  For the patient's aortic valve
replacement, she was anticoagulated with heparin with PTT
goal of 50 to 70.  Once all her procedures were completed,
she was put back on a Coumadin regimen of 5 and 7.5 mg
alternating.  Her INR then became 2.7 upon discharge.

3.  PULMONARY:  Patient was given incentive spirometry and
Combivent inhalers for her chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease.  Her chronic obstructive pulmonary disease much
improved with the Combivent, Flovent and Beclomethasone
inhaler regimen.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Pancreatic cancer.
2.  Aortic valve replacement.
3.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
4.  Breast cancer status post right mastectomy.
5.  Lung cancer status post right lower lobe lobectomy.

MEDICATIONS:
1.  Warfarin 7.5 mg on Monday, Wednesday and Friday and 5 mg
on Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday and Sunday.
2.  Lorazepam 0.5 to 1 mg p.o. q. four to six hours p.r.n.
