Service:  CSU


REASON FOR ADMISSION:  On [**1-14**], Mr. [**Known lastname **] was admitted
for scheduled pulmonic valve repair, and right ventricular
aneurysm repair, coronary artery bypass grafting, and a
planned biatrial maze procedure.  The patient was on Coumadin
for a preoperative history of cerebrovascular accident.  The
patient was admitted for heparinization prior to Operating
Room with cessation of his Coumadin.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
1. This gentleman has a long history of cardiac disease with
   a diagnosis of tetralogy of Fallot.
2. In [**2134**] he had a classic right Blalock-Taussig shunt.
3. In [**2139**] he had a complete repair.
4. In [**2166-12-28**] he had right ventricular outflow tract
   construction with a 24-mm aortic homograft.  At that time,
   he was found to have anomalous left coronary artery off
   the right coronary artery which was sacrificed and
   complicated by emergent coronary artery bypass grafting
   with a vein graft to the LAD and circumflex with
   augmentation of the right ventricular outflow tract for
   right ventricular outflow tract outflow postoperatively.
5. In [**2170**] he had a history of ventricular tachycardia by
   Holter.  He had a negative electrophysiology study, and no
   inducible ventricular tachycardia.
6. Atrial fibrillation.
7. Cerebrovascular accident in [**2139**] with left hemiparesis.
8. Obstructive sleep apnea.
9. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with mild
   restrictive and obstructive disease by pulmonary function
   tests.
10.      Obesity.
11.      Hypercholesterolemia.
12.      Hypertension.


SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives with his wife and two
children (ages 15 and 20).  He has no tobacco history.  No
alcohol history.

ALLERGIES:  He has no known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Enalapril 5 mg p.o. twice daily,
digoxin 0.25 mg p.o. once daily, Lasix 20 mg p.o. once daily,
atenolol 25 mg p.o. once daily, Lipitor 10 mg p.o. once
daily, Coumadin (dosing usually 5 mg but this varied),
trazodone (unknown dose), and baclofen as needed.

RADIOLOGIC STUDIES:  A MRI in [**2175-12-28**] showed a
dilated right ventricle with severe dysfunction and an
ejection fraction of 21 percent, unobstructed RV/PA
homograft, mild proximal PA narrowing bilaterally at the
insertion of the conduit, mild left ventricular dysfunction,
with an ejection fraction on the left side of 45 percent,
dilated ascending aorta to 3.2 cm, vein graft to RCA had
calcified disease, the RCA from the right coronary cuff was
rotated clockwise, the graft in the aorta to the LAD and
circumflex was patent, and the left anomalous vein was
occluded.

EKG showed atrial fibrillation at a rate of 66 with frequent
PVC's, ST depressions in V1 through V5.

Pulmonary function tests previously from [**2176-6-27**] in
[**State 1727**] showed mild obstructive/restrictive disease which
responded to bronchodilators.

A sleep study was also recommended to the patient which - in
[**Month (only) 205**] - showed a mild sleep-related disorder with no CPAP;
although this was recommended to the patient.

On catheterization, the patient had a cardiac index of 2.2 to
2.4, left ventricular end-diastolic pressure of 18 to 20,
right ventricular end-diastolic pressure of 16 to 18, with a
pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 18.  He had branch PA
stenosis at the insertion of the conduit, and conduit
stenosis with a peak gradient of 20 mmHg.  The distal
pulmonary arteries were normal.  The LAD and circumflex graft
was patent.  There was no left main disease.  There was focal
stenosis of the LAD proximal to the graft.  There was mild
mitral regurgitation and mild tricuspid regurgitation.

PREOPERATIVE LABORATORY DATA:  White blood cell count was
7.4, the hematocrit was 44.1, and the platelet count was
118,000.  PT was 14.3, PTT was 30.9, and INR was 1.3.  This
was after admission after cessation of heparin.  Sodium was
137, potassium was 4.3, chloride was 104, bicarbonate was 25,
blood urea nitrogen was 20, creatinine was 0.7, and blood
sugar was 83.  ALT was 19, AST was 22, alkaline phosphatase
was 104, amylase was 45, total bilirubin was 1.7, lipase was
32, and albumin was 4.6.  Magnesium was 2.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  He was 5 feet 10
inches tall.  Weight was 106 kilograms.  He was in atrial
fibrillation at 68, temperature was  93, the blood pressure
was 120/70, and the respiratory rate was 20.  He was sitting
on the bed in no apparent distress.  He had left hemiparesis.
He was alert and oriented times three.  He was cognitively
intact.  The pupils were equally round and reactive to light.
The extraocular movements were intact.  His conjunctivae were
anicteric.  The neck was supple.  No lymphadenopathy or
thyromegaly.  He had decreased breath sounds bilaterally at
the bases.  Heart rate was irregularly irregular with a grade
3/6 systolic ejection murmur.  There was a well-healed
sternal scar.  The abdomen was soft, nontender, and
nondistended.  Positive bowel sounds.  No hepatosplenomegaly.
The extremities were warm and well perfused with 1 plus
edema.  He had 2 plus bilateral femoral pulses, 2 plus
bilateral dorsalis pedis pulses, and 1 plus bilateral
posterior tibial pulses.  No radial pulse on the right and a
2 plus radial pulse on the left.

SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient remained admitted
and hospitalized for the beginning of his heparinization
after cessation of Coumadin.  He had a pulmonary compliance
study also done preoperatively via esophageal balloon.
Please refer the final report by Respiratory Therapy.

On [**1-15**], the patient underwent a redo sternotomy with a
vein graft to the left anterior descending, coronary artery
bypass grafting times one, biatrial radiofrequency maze,
pulmonic valve replacement with 27 pericardial tissue valve,
and reconstruction of the right ventricular outflow tract
with a 24-mm gel weave graft.  The patient also had right
ventricular plication and intraaortic balloon pump was
placed.  He was transferred to the Cardiothoracic Intensive
Care Unit in critical condition on a Levophed drip, a
milrinone drip, an epinephrine drip, and atrioventricular
pacing.

The patient was admitted to the Cardiothoracic Intensive Care
Unit and then later transferred to the Medical Intensive Care
Unit and was followed by the team there.  The patient
continued to have respiratory failure.  He was on an
amiodarone drip at 1 mg a minute, a Levophed drip at 0.4
mcg/kg/min, a milrinone drip at 0.5 mcg/kg/min, a propofol
drip at 30.  The patient was also on an insulin drip and
epinephrine 0.13 mcg/kg/min.  He remained on maximal pressure
support as well as some inotropic support.

Postoperative laboratories were as follows.  White blood cell
count was 4.3, the hematocrit was 39, potassium was 3.6, BUN
was 21, and creatinine was 1.2.  He remained intubated and
sedated, requiring increasing support as well as ventilatory
support.

On postoperative day one, a right femoral arterial line was
placed for monitoring his hemodynamics and a right femoral
Quinton catheter was placed to initiate continuous venovenous
hemodialysis after the patient's very long pump run for
management of his fluid volume status.  The Renal Service
consulted on the patient for helping to manage his volume
overload.  He remained on maximal support at this time;
intubated and sedate with an intraaortic balloon pump.  He
had bilateral coarse breath sounds.  In addition, the [**Location (un) 86**]
Adult Congenital Heart Service saw the patient on
postoperative day one also.  Total bypass time was 7 hours
and 40 minutes.  Cross-clamp time was 1 hour and 5 minutes.
Please refer to the perfusion record.  The patient's chest
had remained open after his transfer to the Operating Room.
Over the course of the evening, the patient required very
high doses of pressors and multiple rounds of blood products.
The Renal staff continued to consult on the patient for his
oliguric acute tubular necrosis with very high filling
pressures.  He remained intubated and in critical condition.
