Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 17961**]
Chief Complaint:
Cough

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
1.  Rigid bronchoscopy with the black [**11-22**] tracheoscope.
2.  Flexible bronchoscopy.
3.  Electrocautery with cutting and release of the anterior
    web-like portion of the complex tracheal stenotic area.
4.  [**Location (un) 1661**] balloon dilatation of stenotic region.


History of Present Illness:
42-yo-woman w/ MMP including tracheal stenosis, CAD, CHF, and
asthma presents w/ cough x 2 days.  Of note, she was intubated
for nearly 1 month for CHF exacerbation in [**4-16**], which was
complicated by tracheal stenosis.  She has had constant stridor
since that time, w/ stridor reportedly increasing in severity
over the past few months.
.
Two days prior to admission, she developed cough productive of
white sputum, and on that day had difficulty breathing after a
coughing episode, prompting eval by her PCP.  [**Name10 (NameIs) **] PCP was
concerned about airway compromise and referred her to the [**Hospital1 18**]
ED for evaluation.  She denies any recent fever, chest pain,
increasing dyspnea, LE edema, and leg pain.  She does complain
of chronic pain in the left lateral chest wall that has been
present for months.  ROS reveals nausea and vomiting since
yesterday morning.  There is no diarrhea.
.
In the ED, she was normotensive, afebrile, w/ normal O2 sat.
She was treated w/ heliox and had subjective improvement in
dyspnea.  CXR did not show any evidence of PNA or CHF.  She is
now admitted to the MICU for ongoing heliox therapy.

Reports:
CT TRACHEA W/O C W/3D REND
IMPRESSION: Right upper tracheal mass measuring 2cm long, up to
7mm wide, arising 3.5cm below the vocal cords, narrowing
tracheal lumen to 3mm across, infiltrating the right
paratracheal soft tissues, possibly the esophagus, innominate
artery, and local mediastinal lymph nodes, most likely squamous
or adenoidcystic carcinoma.

Conclusions:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Color-flow imaging of the
interatrial
septum raises the suspicion of a small atrial septal defect, but
this could
not be confirmed on the basis of this study. There was no
right-to-left
shunting with color or saline contrast + maneuvers.. Left
ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular
cavity is mildly dilated. There is moderate regional left
ventricular systolic dysfunction with basal to mid infero-septal
and inferior hypokinesis. The distal inferior and lateral wall
are also hypokinetic (including the infero-apex). No masses or
thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. There is no ventricular
septal defect. There is mild global right ventricular free wall
hypokinesis. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally
normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Moderately reduced LVEF with regionality c/w CAD. No
evidence of right to left intra-cardiac (or intra-pulmonary)
however a small ASD with mild left to right shunting cannot be
excluded on the basis of this study. If clinically indicated, a
TEE would be better to exclude a small ASD with left to right
shunting.
PERSANTINE MIBI
Reason: 42 Y/O WITH CAD S/P STENTS TO LAD,LCX,RI,WITH EF 30%
PRESENCE OF ISCHEMIA
INTERPRETATION:
The image quality is good.
Left ventricular cavity size is dilated on stress and rest
images.
Rest and stress perfusion images reveal moderately severe fixed
perfusion
defects involving the mid and distal anterolateral wall as well
as the inferior wall.
Gated images reveal severe hypokinesis.
The calculated left ventricular ejection fraction is 16%.
No comparison studies.
IMPRESSION: There are moderately severe fixed perfusion defects
involving the mid and distal anterolateral wall as well as the
inferior wall. There is left ventricular cavity dilatation on
both stress and rest images with severe global hypokinesis and a
calculated LVEF of 16%.
Stress:
INTERPRETATION: 42 yo woman (h/o ischemic cardiomyopathy; s/p
CABG)
was referred for a CAD evaluation prior to surgery. The patient
was
administered 0.142 mg/kg/min of persantine over 4 minutes. No
chest,
back, neck or arm discomforts were reported by the patient
during the
procedure. No significant ST segment changes were noted from
baseline.
The rhythm was sinus with no ectopy noted. The hemodynamic
response to
the persantine infusion was appropriate. Three min post-MIBI,
the
patient received 125 mg aminophylline IV.

IMPRESSION: No anginal symptoms or ischemic ST segment changes.
Nuclear
report sent separately.
CXR: IMPRESSION:
1) Small area of residual stenosis status post balloon
dilatation. No evidence of pneumothorax or pneumomediastinum.
2) Resolution of mild pulmonary edema.


Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 8182**] is a 42-yo-woman w/ tracheal stenosis, CAD, CHF,
DM 2, HTN, hyperlipidemia, asthma admitted w/ cough and stridor.
Admitted to the MICU for stridor, airway management and consult
and tx by CT surgery.
.
# Stridor:  Ms. [**Known lastname 8182**] was felt to have stridor from tracheal
stenosis/mass seen on CT [**2106-3-2**] as well as extended intubation
in [**Month (only) 359**] for CHF exacerbation. Evaluated by CT surgery and IP.
S/P balloon dilatation. CT surgery wished to schedule for
tracheal reconstruction but was unable to get clearance for
surgery at this time from cardiology. Pt EF is 16%. Her stridor
improved throughout her stay, she was initially maintained on
heliox. She did not require intubation in the MICU and she was
transferred to the floor in no respirator
