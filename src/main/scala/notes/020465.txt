Findings
LEFT ATRIUM: Normal LA size. Good (>20 cm/s) LAA ejection
velocity. No thrombus in the LAA.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Normal RA size. A catheter or
pacing wire is seen in the RA and extending into the RV. No ASD
by 2D or color Doppler.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thickness. Normal LV cavity size.
Normal regional LV systolic function.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTA: Normal aortic diameter at the sinus level. Mildly dilated
ascending aorta. Mildly dilated descending aorta. Simple
atheroma in descending aorta.

AORTIC VALVE: Three aortic valve leaflets. Moderately thickened
aortic valve leaflets. Moderate AS (area 1.0-1.2cm2) Moderate to
severe (3+) AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. No MS.
Mild (1+) MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Mild [1+] TR.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflet.
No PS. Physiologic PR. Pulmonic valve not well seen.

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify I was present in compliance with HCFA
regulations. The patient was under general anesthesia throughout
the procedure. The patient received antibiotic prophylaxis. The
TEE probe was passed with assistance from the anesthesioology
staff using a laryngoscope. No TEE related complications.
patient.

REGIONAL LEFT VENTRICULAR WALL MOTION:





     N = Normal, H = Hypokinetic, A = Akinetic, D = Dyskinetic
Conclusions
PRE-CPB:1. The left atrium is normal in size. No thrombus is
seen in the left atrial appendage.
2. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
3. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. Regional left ventricular
wall motion is normal.
4. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal.
5. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The descending
thoracic aorta is mildly dilated. There are simple atheroma in
the descending thoracic aorta.
6. There are three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve
leaflets are moderately thickened and calcified. There is
moderate aortic valve stenosis (valve area 1.0-1.2cm2). Moderate
to severe (3+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
7. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+)
mitral regurgitation is seen.
8. There is no pericardial effusion.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in person of the results.

POST-CPB: On infusion of phenylephrine. A pacing briefly. Well-
seated mechanical valve in the aortic position. Trivial AI.
Gradient is now 22 peak and 11 mean at a cardiac output of 6
L/min. MR remains mild. Normal biventricular systolic function.
Aortic contour is normal post decannulation.
  I certify that I was present for this procedure in compliance
with HCFA regulations.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr [**Known lastname 49957**] was a direct admission  to the Operating Room where
valve replacement was performed.  See operative note for
details, in summary he had: Aortic valve replacement with a [**Street Address(2) 68430**]. [**Hospital 923**] Medical mechanical Regent valve. His bypass time was
129 minutes with a crossclamp of 106 minutes.
He tolerated the operation well and post-operatively was
transferred to the CVICU in stable condition.  He weaned and
extubated the night of surgery.  All tubes lines and drains were
removed per cardiac surgery protocol. On POD1 coumadin was begun
for the mechanical valve and he was transferred to the stepdown
floor for continued care. He was started on diuretics as well as
beta blockade and an ACE inhibitor for BP control.
He went into rapid atrial fibrillation on POD #2, he transferred
back to the ICU for care and was given amiodarone, beta blockade
and calcium channel blockers. After which he converted to sinus
rhythm.
He was transferred back to the stepdown floor on POD #4,
Physical Therapy was consulted for mobility. He did develop some
serous sternal drainage on POD 5 for which he was treated with
IV cefazolin.
The remainder of his hospital course was uneventful. Although he
still had slight drainage without any sign of infection on POD
14, Mr. [**Known lastname 49957**] wanted to go home against medical advice.
Visiting nursing was arranged and follow-up appoi
