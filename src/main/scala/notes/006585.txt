Date of Birth:  [**2115-11-19**]             Sex:   F

Service: [**Hospital Unit Name 196**]

Allergies:
Penicillins

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2704**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest pain, shortness of breath and increased lower extremity
edema.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac catheterization.

History of Present Illness:
The pt. is a 60 year-old female with multiple medical problems
including right heart failure, obstructive sleep apnea and COPD
who presented with a one day history of progressive shortness of
breath, chest "tightness" and increased lower extremity edema.
As per the pt., the VNA nurses were at her home yesterday and
commented on how her legs appeared more swollen.  In addition,
she stated that she did become somewhat more short of breath
over her baseline yesterday.  She added that she was eventually
unable to take more than 2 or 3 steps without becoming dyspneic.
 This morning, the pt. stated that she also developed a "tight"
feeling in the center of her chest which radiated to her back.
The pain is made worse with deep breathing. She stated that the
pain was a [**5-11**] at its worst.  She also noted [**Month/Year (2) 9140**] dyspnea
and diaphoresis associated with this chest tightness and
occasional episodes of lightheadedness and palpitations.  She
denied nausea or vomiting.  She did admit to increasing lower
extremity edema, PND and orthopnea.
On arrival to the ED, she was noted to be tachycardic with a
heart rate in the 120s.  It was felt that she was in MAT.  She
was given 50mg of IV diltiazem, followed by 30mg po diltiazem
with effect and the pt's. heart rate decreased to the 90's and
was noted to be in sinus rhythm.  Her chest pain resolved with a
nitroglycerin IV drip and 2mg morphine sulfate IV times two.
Her first set of cardiac enzymes were negative.  She had a CXR
performed which showed cardiomegaly and mild CHF.  She received
40mg of IV lasix with a good response, as the pt. became less
dyspneic. She was ordered for a V/Q scan to rule out PE in light
of dyspnea and an elevated Ddimer.
Currently, the pt. complains of minor persistent shortness of
breath.  She added that her chest pain has resolved.

MEASUREMENTS:
TR Gradient (+ RA = PASP): *73 mm Hg (nl <= 25 mm Hg)

INTERPRETATION:

Findings:

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: The right atrium is dilated.

LEFT VENTRICLE: The left ventricular cavity is unusually small.
Overall left
ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).

RIGHT VENTRICLE: The right ventricular cavity is markedly
dilated. Right
ventricular systolic function appears depressed. There is
abnormal septal
motion/position consistent with right ventricular
pressure/volume overload.

AORTIC VALVE: There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic
regurgitation is
seen.

MITRAL VALVE: The mitral valve leaflets are moderately
thickened. No mitral
regurgitation is seen.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation
is seen.
There is severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.

GENERAL COMMENTS: Suboptimal image quality due to poor echo
windows.
Suboptimal image quality due to body habitus.

Conclusions:
The right atrium is dilated. The left ventricular cavity is
unusually small
due to compression from the dilated right ventricle. Overall
left ventricular
systolic function appears normal but focal/regional wall motion
abnormality
cannot be excluded due to suboptimal image quality. The right
ventricular
cavity is markedly dilated. Right ventricular systolic function
appears
depressed. There is abnormal septal motion/position consistent
with right
ventricular pressure/volume overload. There is no aortic valve
stenosis. No
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
moderately
thickened. No mitral regurgitation is seen. Moderate to severe
[3+] tricuspid
regurgitation is seen. There is severe pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension.

Compared with the findings of the prior report (tape unavailable
for review)
of [**2176-10-26**] no significant change.





Brief Hospital Course:
1. Atypical chest pain: The pt. had cardiac enzymes which were
negative times three, ruling out an acute myocardial infarction
as cause for her chest pain.  Her nitroglycerin drip was
titrated off by the morning of the second hospital day and she
remained chest-pain free for the remainder of the hospital stay.
 Telemetry showed only sinus tachycardia.

2. CHF:  The pt. appeared to be suffering from an exacerbation
of CHF on admission.  She was aggressively diuresed with IV
lasix with improvement in her shortness of breath and mild
improvement in her lower extremity edema over the first four
hospital days.

A TTE was performed on the third hospital day which revealed the
following:

The left atrium is markedly dilated. The right atrium is
dilated. The left ventricular cavity is unusually small. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is probably preserved. Due to
suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality
cannot be fully excluded. The right ventricular cavity is
markedly dilated. Right ventricular systolic
