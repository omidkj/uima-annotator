CHIEF COMPLAINT:  MICU follow up for chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease flare

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 73-year-old woman with
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (on home O2 and home
nebulizers, PFTs [**12/2195**] revealed FEV1 0.43, FEV1/FVC equals
43%) who arrived at the [**Hospital6 256**]
Emergency Room complaining of some tendencies of shortness of
breath and cough (productive of green white sputum, but no
hemoptysis).  She also had a fever to 101?????? two days prior to
admission.  At home, she had been using home nebulizers
without improvement.  The patient has also been noted to have
substernal chest pain in the past, variably responsive to
sublingual nitroglycerin.  At the time of admission, she was
noted to be diaphoretic and nauseous, but denied vomiting,
orthopnea, lower extremity edema, chills, lightheadedness,
abdominal pain, bright red blood per rectum, melena or
dysuria.

EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE:  The patient was given frequent
nebulizers secondary to tachypnea and low saturations on 2
liters of nasal cannula.  She did not improve until the
nebulizers remained continuous, at which point her O2
saturation came up to 99%.  She was able to speak in full
sentences.  By the time she was discharged from the Emergency
Department, her arterial blood gas on 100% nonrebreather was
7.39, 57, 234.  She was then admitted to the MICU.

MICU COURSE:  The patient was kept on continuous nebulizers
for two to three hours and then tapered to nebulizers q 4 to
6 hours.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease on home O2, 2
liters nasal cannula, has had four to five hospitalizations
in the past year.  Her PFTs of 12/99 revealed FEV1 of 0.43,
FEV1/FVC 43%.
2.  Ejection fraction of 45%, mild aortic regurgitation.
Prior echocardiogram showed cardiomyopathy and pulmonary
hypertension.
3.  Bronchiectasis
4.  Irritable bowel syndrome
5.  Anxiety
6.  Hypothyroidism

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives alone, has home VNA, has a
daughter.  She smoked one to two cigarettes per day and quit

PHYSICAL EXAM:
VITAL SIGNS:  Temperature max 100.2??????, heart rate 113 to 127
regular, blood pressure 104 to 116/41 to 57, respiratory rate
16 to 28, saturating 100% on 2 liters nasal cannula.
GENERAL:  She is in no apparent distress on nasal oxygen, has
a nebulizer on at the time of admission.  She is able to
speak in full sentences.
HEAD, EARS, EYES, NOSE AND THROAT:  Normocephalic,
atraumatic.  Nebulizer mask in place as is the nasal cannula.
NECK:  No jugular venous distention.
LUNGS:  Poor air movement, occasional wheezing, no
consolidations were appreciated.
HEART:  Tachycardia 2 to [**3-14**], left upper sternal border
murmur, ? diastolic murmur.
ABDOMEN:  Soft, nontender.
EXTREMITIES:  No cyanosis, clubbing or edema.
NEUROLOGIC:  She was alert and oriented x3 and grossly
nonfocal.

LABS:  White count 5.2, hematocrit 32.2, 7 eosinophils.  BUN
and creatinine 15/0.7.  TSH on [**5-17**] was 0.35.  Free T4 was
1.4.

IMAGING:  Chest x-ray revealed no pneumonia or congestive
heart failure, but did reveal a calcified left hilar lymph
node.  Her chest x-ray on [**5-23**] revealed chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease/emphysema, no pneumonia or congestive heart
failure.  Stress test in [**2197-3-9**] was negative.
Echocardiogram on [**2197-1-24**] showed ejection fraction
of 45%, moderate aortic regurgitation, trace mitral
regurgitation.  Blood cultures negative.  Urine cultures
negative.

ASSESSMENT:  A 73-year-old woman with severe chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease, mild cardiomyopathy ? admitted
with chest pain (ruled out), shortness of breath (refractory
to home nebulizers, but responsive to the Emergency
Department/MICU continuous nebulizers), 7 to 10 days of cough
and fever likely representing community acquired pneumonia.
She was admitted for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
flare.  She was originally admitted to the Medical Intensive
Care Unit, but called out to the floor.  Her chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease flare was thought to be a
result of increased dyspnea secondary to acute bronchitis
with some component of anxiety leading to a decreased
respiratory rate which causes hyperinflation and then
dyspnea.  The patient also uses albuterol frequently which
has left her with a tremor.  It has been suggested that
Atrovent, Serevent as standing medications with albuterol prn
would be better for her.  It has also been suggested that her
steroid might benefit her, ALTHOUGH SHE DOES HAVE A HISTORY
OF ALLERGIC REACTIONS TO INHALED STEROIDS.

HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEMS:

1.  CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE FLARE:  On [**2197-5-24**],
the patient was continued on Solu-Medrol with plans to switch
to po prednisone when she was more stable.  Nebulizers and
metered dose inhalers were continued.  No inhaled steroids
were ordered.  Levaquin was continued for bronchitic
component.  Protime pump inhibitor was given to her because
of her steroid use.  On [**2197-5-26**], overnight, she was noted to
have shortness of breath and chest pain with pursed lip
breathing noted.  The chest pain revealed sinus tachycardia
without changes from her prior electrocardiogram and her
chest pain was relieved with two sublingual nitroglycerin and
2 mg of subcutaneous morphine.  On [**2197-5-27**], she was switched
to 60 mg of prednisone q day with the thought being that she
would be tapered in a slow fashion from 60 down to 10 over
the course of one week before each change of the taper.
After the time of discharge, she was placed back on her
outpatient regimen of inhalers and nebulizers.  The only
difference was that she was on a higher dose of prednisone
and she was on Levaquin.  The decision as to whether or not
she should go to pulmonary rehabilitation or go home with
services remained a challenging one.

2.  INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  The patient had a fever and cough on
admission.  Although she did not have evidence of pneumonia
on chest x-ray, it was felt she might have had bacterial
bronchitis as of [**2197-5-24**].  She was started on Levaquin which
is to be continued for a 10 to 14 day course.

3.  CARDIOVASCULAR:  She has a history of chest pain, but
ruled out on this admission.  She has been tachycardic, which
is most likely an albuterol effect, possibly a hyperthyroid
effect, possibly due to her infection.  She was maintained on
Imdur, sublingual nitroglycerin, ACE inhibitors and Digoxin,
as well as her hypothyroid medication.

4.  HEME:  She had a low white blood cells as an aberrant lab
value which was repeated.  There was a concern that this
might be a Tapazole effect, although, as mentioned, the
repeat values were normal and she was restarted on Tapazole.

5.  ENDOCRINE:  The patient's hypothyroidism, she was
maintained on Tapazole during the hospital course except for
one day.

ALLERGIES:  SHE IS INTOLERANT TO ASPIRIN, IT CAUSES
GASTROINTESTINAL UPSET AND SHE IS INTOLERANT TO BETA BLOCKERS
BECAUSE OF HER CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Levaquin 500 mg po q day, started [**2197-5-23**] to continue
until [**2197-6-2**].
2.  Atrovent 0.2 mg per ml inhaler, using nebulizer 4x a day.
3.  Serevent 31 mcg 2 puffs every day at bed time.
4.  Combivent 103 to 180 mcg inhaler 2 puffs every four hours
as needed.
5.  Albuterol 0.083% solution 4x a day up to q2h prn.
6.  Prednisone
