Chief Complaint:
hypoxic respiratory failure, ARDS


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation
Tracheostomy
PEG tube placement


History of Present Illness:
56 year old male with a hx of CVA (good functional recovery)
admitted on [**6-21**] to [**Hospital **] Hospital with fevers, cough w/
hemoptysis, SOB x 2 and hypoxemia, tachypnea, and elevated WBC.
He was intubated shortly after arrival for hypoxemia. Family
members were diagnosed with strep throat prior to his admission,
and he had some dust exposure while cleaning the roof of his
house before admission. CT on [**6-21**] showed diffuse bilateral
airspace infiltrate, increased at the bases, no evidence of PE.
He has been on >80% FiO2 for the past 2 weeks, currently on 100%
FiO2 with a PEEP of 15. Saturations today ([**7-5**]) have been in
the mid 80s to low 90s. First bronch complicated by
pneumothorax,and was + for pseudomonas. Second bronch
complicated by post-bronch desats to mid80s, and showed 9900 WBC
87%p. Recent imaging showed bilateral alveolar interstital
infiltrates, slightly improved compaged to [**2135-7-4**]. He was
started on gentamycin and cefepime at the outside hospital, on
arrival here we have switched him to gent/[**Last Name (un) 2830**].

Of note he also experienced some high fevers starting [**6-29**]
(105 F).

 No pleural effusions.

ICU Labs

CXR [**7-6**]: Widespread infiltrative pulmonary abnormality is still
present, but has improved generally in the right lung and in the
left upper lung since [**7-5**]. That component of the abnormality
was probably recoverable pulmonary edema.  What remains may be
the residual of diffuse alveolar damage, in the right lung, and
pneumonia in the lingula and left lower lobe.  Pleural effusion
is minimal, if any.  There is no pneumothorax.

CXR [**7-7**]: upper lobe could represent fibrotic stage of ARDS
given the fact that they are not resolving and where largest
abnormalities were present on [**6-21**].

ECHO [**7-8**]: The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal
defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or
saline contrast with maneuvers. Left ventricular wall thickness,
cavity size and regional/global systolic function are normal
(LVEF >55%). There is no ventricular septal defect. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good
leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic
regurgitation. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with
trivial mitral regurgitation. There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There
is no pericardial effusion.

Echo [**8-1**] The left atrium is moderately dilated. No atrial
septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size
and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). There is no
ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and
free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no
aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation. No masses or
vegetations are seen on the aortic valve. The mitral valve
appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse. No mass or vegetation is seen
on the mitral valve. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure
could not be determined.

[**7-11**] bilateral lower extremity dopplers: IMPRESSION:  No evidence
of a right or left lower extremity DVT.

[**7-12**] Abdominal U/S: IMPRESSION: 1.  Left-sided nephrolithiasis as
described above. 2.  Stable right kidney calyceal diverticulum
or cyst. 3.  Normal caliber of the abdominal aorta.

[**7-12**] CT chest w/out contrast: IMPRESSION:  Interval decrease in
consolidative opacities bilaterally, with likely conversion into
fibrotic stage of ARDS or progressed preexisting fibrotic lung
disease with patchy ground glass opacities with increased
interstitial septal thickening, subpleural reticular and cystic
changes with traction bronchiectasis and apical right greater
than left honeycombing.  No findings to suggest infection.

[**7-20**] CT Sinus/mandible/maxillofacial w/out contrast: IMPRESSION:
1.  Moderate mucosal thickening of the sphenoid sinuses with
secretions.
Minimal opacification of the right mastoid air cells. 2.  Remote
right occipital infarction with ex vacuo dilatation of the right
lateral ventricle, better assessed on the head CT of the same
date.

[**7-20**] CT Head w/out contrast: IMPRESSION: 1.  Limited study due
to extensive motion artifact.  Within this limitation, subtle
area of hypodensity in l
