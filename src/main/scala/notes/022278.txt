Chief Complaint:
hypoxia on a NRB

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 60825**] is a 63 yo man with h/o biphenotypic ALL, now Day
+ 32 from allogeneic SCT, who presents to clinc with one week of
worsening SOB and two days of a clear productive cough.  The
patient states his SOB occured when lying flat, but not with
activity.  Also admitted to chest pressure which would come and
go in his left chest no related to the SOB.  Sleeps with 3
pillows (no change from baseline), denies PND; admits to a
slight increase in lower extremity edema.  Admits to low grade
fevers to the 99's and crampy abdominal pain.  Denies chills,
night sweats, vomiting, or diarrhea.

The patient had attended a routine clinic appointment for lab
monitoring and was found to be hypoxic in the low 80's on RA.
He came up to 95% on 4L NC and went for a CXR which was
concerning for CHF vs viral PNA.  He then dropped to the mid
80's on 6L and was placed on a NRB. He was treated with
cefepime, vancomycin, and acyclovir at clinic and BCx were
drawn.  He was given 20 mg of IV lasix with little improvement
and continued to sat in the mid 90's on a NRB.

In the ED his inital VS were 101.1  90  127/72  24 97% on NRB,
85% when supine.  He has a history of b/l upper extremity clots
and underwent b/l lower extrem and right upper extrem US which
showed no DVT.  He was ordered for a CTA to rule out PE, however
given that he desated while lying flat he was unable to undergo
the study.  He also received a dose of levaquin in the ED and
tylenol for his fever.  An ABG on the NRB showed 7.45/40/219 and
a lactate of 1.0.

ROS: The patient denies constipation, melena, hematochezia,
headache, rash or skin changes.  All other ROS as above.

ECG: Sinus rhythm at 80 bpm, nl axis, nl PR, QRS, and QT
intervals, no ST or T-wave changes.  Unchanged from previous
EKG.

Imaging:
CXR ([**2-28**]):IMPRESSION: PA and lateral chest compared to chest
radiographs since [**1-7**], most recently [**2-23**]:
There is new mild perihilar interstitial abnormality in the left
lung, exaggeration of the opacity, slight increase in caliber to
the mediastinum in the region of the azygos vein and a
cross-sectional area of hilar pulmonary arteries suggests that
the interval change could all be due to pulmonary edema although
an interstitial pneumonia such as viral infection cannot be
excluded. Heart is mildly enlarged, unchanged. Elevation of the
right lung base is longstanding, but small right pleural
effusion appears to have increased.

CXR ([**2-28**]):  Left subclavian central venous catheter tip
terminates within the lower aspect of the SVC. The cardiac and
mediastinal contours are unchanged. Lung volumes are lower than
on the previous examination. However, there appears to be
worsening opacification of the left basilar and right upper lobe
opacities concerning for worsening pneumonia. Additionally,
small loculated right pleural effusion is unchanged from the
prior study. Small left pleural effusion is also unchanged.
There is increased perihilar haziness and vascular
indistinctness also compatible with pulmonary edema, left
greater than right. No pneumothorax.

B/l lower extremity and RUE US ([**2-28**]): No evidence of deep
venous thrombosis in either lower extremity.  No evidence of
right upper extremity deep venous thrombosis.


Brief Hospital Course:
Assessment/ Plan: Patient is a 63 yo man with h/o ALL, now day +
34 from allogeneic SCT, who presented with hypoxia and a
productive cough.
.
# Respiratory Infection:  The patient developed acute onset of
hypoxia, accompanied by fever and a productive cough.  His CXR
on admission demonstrated a worsening of his left basilar and
right upper lobe opacities, which was concerning for an
infectious process, as well as a small loculated pleural
effusion.  The patient was empirically started on Cefepime,
Levaquin, Acyclovir, and Vancomycin, but this was changed to
Clindamycin and Primaquine (possible PCP), Levofloxacin,
Posaconazole (previous Aspergillus), Ganciclovir (CMV), and
Vancomycin (previous CDiff).   Primaquin and Clindamycin were
discontinued on [**3-2**], and Cefepime and Vanc were restarted on
[**3-3**].  He completed a course of levoquin for what was likely
CAP.  He remained on galgyclovir and was dischared on Valgan and
will need to continue it until he has two negative CMV viral
loads that are at least five days apart.
.
#. ALL: The patient has a history of biphenotypic acute
leukemia, and he is currently Day + 34 from allogeneic SCT. The
patient tolerated the SCT well and he is no longer neutropenic.
He was continued on his home dose of Cyclosporine, and his ANC
was monitored daily.  The patient was also continued on his home
mouthcare regimen.  Caphasol for mouthcare and monitor for
evidence of mucositis.  His Cyclosporine 150 mg qam and 100 mg
qpm was continued and his levels were in the appropriate range.
.
# Hypertension: The patient has a history of hypertension, and
he is currently on Lisinopril, Amlodipine, Imdur, and Toprol XL
as an outpatient.  His home medications were h
