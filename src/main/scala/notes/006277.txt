Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7575**]
Chief Complaint:
Convulsion in patient with seizure D/O.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none.


History of Present Illness:
43 year old woman with presumed seizure D/O left Neurology
service AMA on day of readmission for seizure.  She was admitted
first to the Neuro ICU and then to the general/epilepsy
neurology floor team from [**Date range (1) 25045**]/07 after having a generalized
convulsion on [**7-23**] at work ([**Hospital3 **] neurology
department).  She then had 3 more convulsions on her way to the
ED for which she recieved 12mg ativan and 1 gm of dilantin.  The
patient was ultimately admitted and monitored on LTM.  Numerous
push button events were captured without evidence of
epileptiform activity.  Concerned that here home AED regimen of
lamictal 350 daily he was increased to 100 in the morning and
350 in the evening.  In addition keppra 500mg [**Hospital1 **] was added.
She continued
to have convulsions while in the ICU on [**2142-7-24**] despite the
negative EEG evidence for epileptic events.  She had a workup
for reversible seizure triggers.  Infectious workup was
negative.  The patient had a severely depressed TSH suggesting
possible hypothyroidism as her trigger.  However, her free T4,
total T3, and total T4 were normal.  She was being followed by
endocrine.  The patient was transferred out of the ICU late on
[**7-24**].  She required ativan for two more seizure episodes before
the EEG referred to above was read.  in the afternoon of [**7-25**],
she took a fall.  She became very angry after this fall saying
that the 1:1 sitter didn't try to prevent it and the nurses were
slow to respond.  She then had another convulsive episode.  The
care team went to the bedside and though her eyes were
fluttering, her hands were shaking, and she was totally
unresponsive to voice, the bedside EEG didn't show any seizure
activity.  A set of vital signs were attempted but the patient
refused becoming suddenly able to hold a coherent conversation.
She asked to speak with the attending, who was contact[**Name (NI) **].  [**Name2 (NI) **]
asked that we reconnect her to the EEG monitor, which she had
disconnected, but she refused and insisted on leaving AMA.  She
announced that she was going to leave and speak to a reporter
about the terrible care provided at the [**Hospital1 18**].  She ultimately
signed an AMA form and left.  The chief resident provided her
with a prescription for Keppra.

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient readmitted with convulsions after leaving AMA in the
middle of an admission to determine if her seizures were
epileptic.  During this admission we increased her lamictal to
200 in the morning and 300 in the afternoon.  We did not change
her keppra regimen.  She refused long term monitoring.  She
developed an inability to walk two days prior to discharge.
This appeared non-physiologic on physical exam and resolved
spontaneously on the day of dicharge without specific
intervention.  The patient was discharged with follow up with
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2442**] on the regiment documented below.
