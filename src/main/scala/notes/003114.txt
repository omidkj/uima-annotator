History of Present Illness:
Patient was a 77 year-old gentleman who developed dyspnea in
high 40s and was diagnosed with asthma years ago becaming
progressively worse over the years and much worse in the last
several months. He had multiple admissions for COPD
exacerbations, bronchitis and pneumonia requiring steroids and
antibiotic therapy. He had never been intubated for any of these
episodes. He had a terrible intractable cough and inability to
clear secretions having to sleep with his head elevated. He has
required 2.5 to 3 liters of oxygen continuously over the past 5
months at home. He has required prednisone over the last 8
months and he is dyspneic to the point where he could not walk
more than 50 to 100 feet nor could he walk up a flight of
stairs. He was eventually diagnosed with tracheobronchomalacia
and underwent stringent preoperative evaluation including
respiratory questionnaires, 6-minute walk test, functional
bronchoscopies, dynamic airway CT scan and a stenting trial. He
did well with all these such that it was felt that he would
benefit from definitive surgical management; namely, a tracheo-
and bilateral bronchoplasties with mesh.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 4580**] was admitted to Dr.[**Name (NI) 1816**] service on [**2179-9-17**] at [**Hospital1 18**].  On that day, he underwent a
tracheobronchoplasty.  The operation went smoothly, and his
initial postoperative course was uneventful. Unfortunately, he
developed an ARDS pattern requiring reintubation with
progressive ventilatory support. The patient was then taken back
to the operating room on [**2179-10-7**], where a left lung
biopsy was performed.  The initial pathological examination
demonstrated end-stage lung disease with honeycomb change and
moderate chronic interstitial inflammation with focal
fibroplastic foci favoring end-stage UIP. It was known that the
patient had some degree of UIP in his preoperative CT scan, but
it was felt that his main respiratory issue limiting his
functional status was his tracheobronchomalacia. Unfortunately,
it appears that he developed an acute exacerbation of his UIP in
the perioperative period. On [**2179-10-16**], he went into a
peculiar arrhythmia of supraventricular tachycardia superimposed
on atrial fibrillation with periods of hemodynamic instability.
The patient's daughters were immediately contact[**Name (NI) **] and informed.
The immediate family was then present at the bedside within the
hour as was the Attending Surgeon.  After discussion with the
Nursing staff, House Staff and Attending Surgeon, the family
decided to withdraw hemodynamic and ventilatory support and make
the patient as comfortable as possible.  He succumbed to his
underlying condition in the presence of his family on the
evening of [**2179-10-16**].  An autopsy was declined by the
family.
