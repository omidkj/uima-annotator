[**2112-6-19**] CXR
IMPRESSION:
1. No definite evidence of pulmonary edema within the limits of
this portable examination with poor inspiratory effort.

thrombosis.

[**2112-6-21**] PICC line placement

5 French double-lumen PICC line placement via the right brachial
venous approach. Final internal length is 40 cm, with the tip
positioned in SVC. The line is ready to use.

Microbiology
Urine positive for enterococcus. Foley changed on [**2112-6-22**],
urinanalysis is negative. Infectious disease consulted, they
feel this is colonized and no treatment is indicated except for
periodic catheter changes.


Brief Hospital Course:
Patient readmitted on [**2112-6-19**] from [**Hospital 14468**] Nursing Home when
they were unable to get intravenous access to give her
intravenous antibiotics. Family also noted she was unable to
tolerate the pureed foods at the nursing home and was taking in
very little. Chest x-ray done which was consistent with prior
reads. PICC line attempted but unable to do secondary to edema
of upper extremities. Upper extremitie ultrasound performed
which was negative for clot. Peripheral line attempt was
sucessful and patient resumed her zosyn course. Speech and
swallow revaluated patient and found that she is able to take
thin liquids and ground food instead of pureed. Urine culture is
positive for enterococcus. Infectious disease consulted, urine
culture is negative for infection so they believe that this is
colonization and no treatment is required beyond regular
catheter changes.

Problems
1. Iv access - PICC line placed. Has one more day of Zosyn.
2. Anorexia - Patient eating better now that she can eat thin
liquids/ground. We have also ordered supplements between meals.
