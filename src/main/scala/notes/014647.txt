Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1042**]
Chief Complaint:
respiratory distress

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
1. Intubation and extubation
2. PICC placement


History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **]F w/ h/o PE on coumadin, HTN, Afib, diastolic CHF p/w
respiratory distress from NH. Pat was noted to be in respiratory
distress at [**Hospital **] rehab. Was brought to [**Hospital1 **] ED for further
eval. There, she was noted to have lots of oral secretions,
fixed pinpoint pupils (not on narcotics), altered mental status.
She was afebrile and satting in 70s. She was originally DNR/DNI,
but daughter ([**Name (NI) 191**])changed code status to full at bedside. She
was intubated, central and A-line access were established, and
antibiotics (vanco/ Zosyn) given. She underwent CTA that in wet
read showed no PE, opacities most likely consistent with
pulmonary edema. Patient was also hypertensive and was started
on nitro drip. No lasix given because of ARF w/ Crea 1.9
(baseline 0.9 in [**2125-8-1**]).

ED Vitals upon transfer: 127/70 (A-Line correlates with cuff)

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2126-2-9**] 7:45 PM

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST

Reason: r/o ICH as cause of ALOC

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
[**Age over 90 **] year old woman with resp failure INR 3.3 also ALOC
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
r/o ICH as cause of ALOC
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.

INDICATION: [**Age over 90 **]-year-old woman with respiratory failure, INR of
3.3 as well as loss of consciousness. No definite trauma history
provided.

COMPARISON: Non-contrast head CT from [**2125-7-13**].

FINDINGS: There is no evidence of acute hemorrhage, edema, mass
effect, hydrocephalus or acute vascular territorial infarct.
Moderate-to-severe involutional change is stable.
Periventricular and subcortical white matter hypodensity
consistent with small vessel ischemic disease is also stable as
are lacunes in the left external capsule and left basal ganglia.
Calcification of the distal vertebral and cavernous internal
carotid arteries is again noted. The patient is intubated. There
is opacification of scattered ethmoid air cells as well as
mucosal thickening within the right sphenoid air cell.

IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial hemorrhage.

CTA CHEST W&W/O C&RECONS, NON-CORONARY  [**2126-2-9**] 4:45 PM

CTA CHEST W&W/O C&RECONS, NON-

Reason: eval for new/worsening PE
Field of view: 36 Contrast: OPTIRAY

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
[**Age over 90 **] year old woman with recent PNA and prior PE p/w resp failure,
intubated
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
eval for new/worsening PE
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.

INDICATION: [**Age over 90 **]-year-old female with recent pneumonia and prior
PE presenting with respiratory failure.

COMPARISON: CTA chest from [**2125-8-8**].

TECHNIQUE: MDCT axial images from the thoracic inlet through the
mid abdomen were obtained prior to and following administration
of 90 cc of intravenous Optiray contrast. Multiplanar
reformations were performed.

CT CHEST WITHOUT AND WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: Again
demonstrated is a heterogeneously enhancing 3.5 x 5.4 cm mass in
the right lobe of the thyroid gland. The lesion is compresses
the trachea, displacing the endotracheal tube to the left. The
tip of the endotracheal tube terminates in a slightly low
position, only 1.3 cm above the carina. No filling defects are
seen within the pulmonary arterial vasculature to indicate
underlying pulmonary embolus. There is severe enlargement of all
four cardiac [**Doctor Last Name 1754**]. Calcifications are noted in the coronary
vessels and aortic valve annulus. No pathologically enlarged
mediastinal, hilar or axillary lymph nodes are identified. The
lungs demonstrate diffuse ground-glass opacities within the
upper lobes, right greater than left, with associated smooth
intralobular septal thickening, consistent with pulmonary
interstitial edema. There are small bilateral pleural effusions,
right greater than left. There is mild dependent bibasilar
atelectasis. No pneumothorax is noted. Nasogastric tube is seen
with its tip in the stomach.

In the imaged upper abdomen, the visualized liver dome, spleen
and stomach appear grossly unremarkable. There are no osseous
findings suspicious for malignancy. Moderately severe
degenerative changes are present throughout the thoracic spine.
There is severe osteoarthritis involving the left shoulder with
subchondral cystic change and heterotopic bone formation
involving the head of the humerus and glenoid.

IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of pulmonary embolus.
2. Low-lying endotracheal tube, only 1.3 cm above the carina.
3. Small bilateral pleural effusions with widespread
ground-glass opacity in the upper lobes and interlobular septal
thickening, consistent with pulmonary edema.
4. Heterogeneous mass in the right thyroid gland which displaces
the endotracheal tube.
5. Severe osteoarthritis of the left shoulder.

Echocardiogram [**2126-2-11**]
The left atrium is moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric
left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and
systolic function (LVEF>55%). There is no ventricular septal
defect. The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with mild
global free wall hypokinesis. The ascending aorta is mildly
dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but
aortic stenosis is not present. No masses or vegetations are
seen on the aortic valve. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is
no mitral valve prolapse. No mass or vegetation is seen on the
mitral valve. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. There is
severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a small
pericardial effusion. There are no echocardiographic signs of
tamponade.

If clinically suggested, the absence of a vegetation by 2D
echocardiography does not exclude endocarditis.

IMPRESSION: No evidence of endocarditis or abscess seen. Dilated
and hypokinetic right ventricle with severe pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2125-7-17**],
the right ventricle appears slightly dilated and hypokinetic on
the current study (may have been so on the prior but is not well
visualized). The other findings are similar.
