Pertinent Results:
Catheterization:
BRIEF HISTORY:   [**Age over 90 **] yo man with hypertension and dyslipidemia
referred
for peripheral arteriography to evaluate significant bilateral
leg
claudication (L>R).  He had ABIs which were also diminished
bilaterally
(0.82 right ankle, 0.66 left ankle).  Lower extremity doppler
evaluation
showed triphasic waveforms in bilateral common femoral arteries
and
evidence of a left SFA occlusion.

INDICATIONS FOR CATHETERIZATION:
Peripheral vascular disease, claudication, positive noninvasive
ischemia
evaluation

PROCEDURE:
Peripheral Catheter placement was performed via the RFA.
Peripheral Imaging was performed of the AA and bilateral LE.
Peripheral PTA was performed of the R SFA.
Peripheral Stenting was performed of the R SFA.
Peripheral Atherectomy was performed of the R SFA.

PTCA COMMENTS:     Initial angiography revealed a 70% lesion at
the
origin of the SFA and a mid-segment occlusion of the SFA in the
left
lower extremity. Heparin was started prophylactically. A 7
French [**Last Name (un) 12297**]
sheath was advanced into the left CFA. The total occlusion of
the left
SFA was crossed with moderate difficuly using a Shinobi wire
followed by
an angled stiff Glidewire. Atherectomy was performed on th
eproximal SFA
using a Silverhawk LS device with good result. We were unable to
deliver
the Silverhawk device distal to the total occlusion, so the
occlusion
was dilated with a 3.0 x 20 mm Saavy balloon using 3 inflations
of 6
ATM. We were still unable to deliver the atherectomy device so
the
diecsion was made to proceed with stenting of the left SFA. A
7.0 x 56
mm Dynalink stent was deployed across the lesion and a 4.0 x 60
mm Saavy
balloon was used to dilate the stent at 120 ATM. Angiography
demonstrated a filling defect at the proximal edge of the stent
so a 7.0
x 100 mm Dynalink stent was deployed proximal to the first stent
in
overlapping fashion and both stents were dilated with the 4.0 x
60 mm
balloon using 3 inflations of 6 ATM. Final angiography revealed
no
residual stenosis, no apparent dissection, and normal flow.

COMMENTS:
1. Access was obtained in retrograde fashion via the RFA using a
6
French short sheath.
2. Resting hemodynamics revealed no significant pressure
gradient
between AO and either common femoral artery.
3. Abdominal aortography revealed nild diffuse athersclerotic
disease.
4. The renal arteries were single bilaterally. The left renal
artery had
a 70% proximal stenosis and minimal blush was noted in the left
kidney.
The right renal artery had a proximal 70% stenosis.
5. Selective angiography of the right lower extremity revealed
no
significant disease in the CIA or EIA. The SFA was subtotally
occluded
at the adductor. The popliteal had no significant disease. The
AT and PT
were occluded with the PA filling the foot.
6. Selective angiography of the left lower extremity revealed no

significant disease in the CIA or EIA. There were mild luminal
irreguarities in the CFA. The SFA was totally occluded in its
mid
segment and reconstituted just above the popliteal artery. The
popliteal
artery was not obstructed.
7. Successful atherectomy of the proximal left SFA (see PTA
comments).
8. Successful PTA and stenting of the mid SFA with overlapping
7.0 x 100
mm and 7.0 x 56 mm Dynalink stents which were postdilated with a
6.0 mm
balloon. Final angiography revealed no residual stenosis, no
apparent
dissection and normal flow (see PTA comments).

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Bilateral SFA and infrapopliteal disease.
2. Bilateral renal artery stenosis.
3. Successful atherectomy, PTA, and stenting of the left SFA.

Right femoral vascular ultrasound:
Right common femoral artery and common femoral vein are widely
patent, without pseudoaneurysm or AV fistula. No large hematoma
is identified within the soft tissues of the right groin.

IMPRESSION:

No evidence of pseudoaneurysm, AV fistula or hematoma within the
right groin.


Brief Hospital Course:
Pt was taken to the catheterization lab and a stent was placed
in the left superficial femoral artery.  At the end of the
procedure it was very difficult to attain hemostasis at the
right groin access site.  As there was concern for development
of hematoma or pseudoaneurysm, pt was admitted to the CCU where
he was monitored closely and had multiple stable hematocrit
checks.  A femoral vascular ultrasound was performed at the
right groins site and showed neither pseudoaneurysm or hematoma.
 Pt was stable and was discharged to home with plan to return at
a later date for stenting of the right femoral artery.
