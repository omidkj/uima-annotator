History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 83420**] is a 45 year old female with no significant past
medical history who developed B symptoms of fevers and night
sweats as well as some cough and progressive dyspnea.  This led
her to present to [**Hospital6 2561**] after approximately one
week of symptoms on [**2153-8-7**].  At [**Hospital3 2568**] she was found to have
a leukocytosis to 115,000 as well as thrombocytopenia with 7%
blasts on differential.  LDH was 1661 and uric acid was 4.2.
She had a CT chest that showed diffuse ground glass opacities in
both lungs, thickening of bronchovascular bundle, small right
pleural effusion, and  centrilobular emphysematous changes of
the upper lobes with pretracheal and subcarinal adenopathy.
Thus, she was started on levofloxacin and ceftriaxone.
Hematology/Oncology evaluated her and a bone marrow biopsy was
obtained prior to transfer to [**Hospital1 18**] for further work up.  She
was hypoxic, requiring supplementary oxygen by nasal cannula on
arrival here but denied other complaints.  Her antibiotics were
switched to vancomycin, cefepime, and oseltamavir.

After arrival at [**Hospital1 18**] a repeat CT showed similar findings to
those seen on the [**Hospital3 **] scan and she was started on
hydroxyurea for her initial leukocytosis of 120,000.  With
hydroxyurea her WBC count l WBC 120,000 and her WBC has improved
today to 32,000. Bone marrow bx here suggestive of acute myeloid
leukemia, cytogenetics pending. Despite broad antibiotic
coverage, her O2 requirement began to increase and micafungin
was added empirically [**8-10**] for fungal coverage. On [**8-11**] pt had
worsening hypoxia with O2 sat 90% on 50% FM. She was given lasix
10 mg IV with ~1.5L urine output. ABG revealed respiratory
alakalosis with concomittant metabolic alkalosis. Bicarb gtt was
discontinued to improve metabolic alkalosis. She was noted to
have a temperature of 104 and standing tylenol was ordered. She
underwent a repeat CT thorax that revealed worsening widespread
ground glass opacities in the lungs bilaterally, with airspace
opacities in the lung bases, right middle lobe, and lingula. Due
to lack of improvement in respiratory status, and also with
plans to initiate chemotherapy for presumed component of
infiltrative leukemia adding to worsening respiratory status,
she was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].

In the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] she was started on vancomycin and Bactrim and was
transfused platelets and blood.  She was intubated for increased
work of breathing.  A BAL was negative for PCP and the Bactrim
was stopped.  The bronch later was galactomannan positive and
the pt was started on voriconazole.  The pt eventually required
pressors.  On [**8-16**] she developed hypertension with bradycardia
and suspicion for [**Location (un) 3484**] triad led to getting a head CT.
This showed wedge-shaped hypodensity seen in the left cerebellar
hemisphere and neurology was consulted.  Pt was extubated [**8-22**].
MRI [**8-23**] showed Ring-enhancing lesion suspicious for abscess,
lymphoma, or solitary metastasis.

Pt came to the BMT floor in stable condition.  She denied fever,
chills, HA, vision changes, SOB, Chest pain, Cough, abdominal
pain, diarhea, constipation, or urinary symptoms.


Past Medical History:
