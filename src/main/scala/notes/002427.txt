Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1390**]
Chief Complaint:
Bowel obstruction and respiratory failure POD12 from emergent
right hemicolectomy

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2153-5-12**]: Tracheostomy and PEG ([**Doctor Last Name 853**])
[ prior to admission - [**2153-4-18**]: Exlap right hemicolectomy
([**Doctor Last Name **]) ]


History of Present Illness:
Ms [**Known lastname 46117**] is a 50F with steroid-dependent COPD known to the
ACS service from recent admission for free air & extensive
pneumatosis now s/p ex-lap and R colectomy ([**4-18**]) who returns on
transfer from OSH for bowel obstruction and respiratory failure.
Pt was discharged in good condition with functioning bowels. Hx
obtained from daughter as pt is intubated: She has been
increasingly distended and nauseated since discharge. She has
been keeping her pills down but has been regurgitating into her
mouth. This AM at home she looked ill and her lips were blue.
She was taken to [**Hospital3 **] where CXR and KUB showed
massive gastric dilatation and small bowel dilatation with
stool/contrast in the rectum. An NGT was placed with hurricane
spray and pt aspirated. She went into respiratory failure and
was intubated prior to transfer. Post intubation film confirmed
the NGT well within the stomach, which was decompressed, and
appropriate positioning of the NGT.

dependence, hypothyroidism, chronic constipation, multiple

[**5-21**]: CT torso:
1. Increased number and confluence of cavitary lesions noted in
the left
lower lobe consolidation. Other previously reported diffuse
cavitary lesions and ground-glass opacities appear relatively
stable. These findings are consistent with necrotizing pneumonia
or septic emboli with superimposed necrotizing lobar pneumonia;
fungal infection such as invasive aspergillosis is also
considered.
2. Interval resolution of pleural effusion.
3. Stable ileocolic anastomosis without evidence of anastomotic
leak or bowel
obstruction.
4. Minimal residual debris at site of prior pigtail drain
without evidence of
reaccumulated or new focal abscess.
5. Stable thoracic spine compression fractures.
6. Pancreatic calcifications consistent with chronic
pancreatitis.


Brief Hospital Course:
Ms [**Known lastname 46117**] was admitted to the ICU upon her arrival to the
[**Hospital1 18**] Emergency Department. She arrived from [**Location **]
intubated/sedated on mechanical ventilation. During her 3 week
ICU stay, her primary issues were pulmonary and infectious. In
brief, we were unable to wean her from the ventilator but her
mental status normalized and her gut tolerated tube feeds. A
detailed hospital course is below.

Neuro: CT head ([**4-30**]) was performed at presentation as
neurologic status could not be adequately assessed and
precipitating insult was not confirmed. This showed no acute
intracranial pathology.

CV: She had an intermittent pressor requirement. She underwent
trans-thoracic echocardiogram on [**5-9**] and [**5-17**], both studies
showed good cardiac function (EF 65%). There was question of
valve vegetation, but no TEE was performed.

PU: CT Chest on admission showed left lower lobe consolidation
and peribronchial ground glass opacities bilaterally, thought to
be due to infection with possible aspiration. She remained
ventilator dependent during the stay. On HD3, she self-extubated
and soon became tachypnic and hypoxic so was re-intubated.
Repeated attempts to wean pressure support were limited by
tachypnea, tachycardia and hypoxia. She underwent multiple
bronchoscopies to remove secretions and mucous plugs. Repeat
Chest CT on [**5-8**] showed interval worsening of the large left
lower lobe consolidation and interval increase of innumerable
small cavitary lesions compatible with diffuse dissemination of
infection. Once apparent she would likely never wean from the
vent, she underwent tracheostomy [**2153-5-12**]. Repeat chest CT on [**5-21**]
was consistent with worsening necrotizing pneumonia.

GI: She arrived with an NGT in place given her sedation and risk
for aspiration. Tube feeds were started [**5-7**]. Repeat CT abd/pelv
on [**5-8**] showed the anastamosis to be intact, no evidence of
bowel obstruction and near-complete resolution of abdominal
ascites and resolution of deep pelvic collection. Percutaneous
gastrostomy tube was placed on [**5-12**] and feeds were begun the
following day.

GU: Urine culture from [**5-7**] showed >100k yeast. Renal ultrasound
on [**5-18**] showed no evidence of fungal infection. Foley was kept in
place, and urine output remained adequate.

FEN: She required few IV boluses. She was started on TPN [**2153-5-1**]
and continued until could tolerate tube feed nutrition.

HEM: She exhibited an initial rise then persistently elevated
WBC. On admit, was 2.5, rose to 13.0 by HD6, peaked at 35.3
[**2153-5-22**]. She was transfused 2 units PRBC on HD 4 and required
pressors and was not responding sufficiently to crystalloid
resuscitation. However, once adequately rescusitated, the
patient was weaned off of pressors, and did not require
additional blood transfusions.

ID: In summary of her infectious course, she had a pelvic
abscess growing C. perfringens and [**Female First Name (un) 564**] that was treated. She
then developed findings concerning for cavitary pneumonia with
mucocutaneous candidiasis in bladder, esophagus and lungs. She
never had fungemia. Possible fungal reservoir include heart
valves, which would require amphoteracin treatment. On HD2, she
underwent IR-guided drain placement of the pelvic abscess. This
drain was removed after 8 days and CT pelvis showed resolution
of abscess. Her antibiotic therapy changed frequently based on
recommendations from the Infectious Disease consult team and her
culture data.
