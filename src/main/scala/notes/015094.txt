who had a recent abnormal exercise treadmill test and was
referred to [**Hospital6 256**] for cardiac
catheterization.  The patient presented to his primary care
physician with complaints of hemoptysis times two.  The
patient underwent chest computerized tomography scan which
shows emphysematous changes of both lungs and calcification
of his coronary arteries and cholelithiasis.  The patient was
referred for exercise treadmill test which was remarkable for
electrocardiogram changes.  Thallium imaging revealed a
moderate to severe completely reversible defect at the
inferior half of the lateral wall and the majority of the
inferior wall.  Ejection fraction was noted at that time to
be 37%.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1.  Cholelithiasis; 2.  Peptic ulcer
disease; 3.  History of melena; 4.  Hypercholesterolemia; 5.
Current smoker.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Preoperative medications include
Aspirin 81 mg three times a week, Lipitor 10 mg at bedtime,
Tagamet prn, Folic acid.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient underwent cardiac
catheterization on [**2182-7-1**] which showed an ejection
fraction of 50%, 70% left main occlusion, 30% mid left
anterior descending occlusion, 100% mid circumflex occlusion,
100% right coronary artery occlusion.  The patient was
admitted to the hospital after his catheterization and was
taken to the Operating Room on [**2182-7-2**] with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 70**] for a coronary artery bypass graft times three,
left internal mammary artery to left anterior descending,
left radial artery to posterior descending artery, saphenous
vein graft to obtuse marginal.  The patient was transferred
to the Intensive Care Unit in stable condition on Propofol
and Nitroglycerin infusions, please see operative note for
further details.  The patient was weaned and extubated for
mechanical ventilation on his first postoperative night.  The
patient remained hemodynamically stable with adequate blood
pressure and cardiac index.  On postoperative day #1, the
patient was transferred from the Intensive Care Unit to the
floor.  On postoperative day #2 the patient's chest tubes and
pacing wires were removed.  The patient began ambulating with
physical therapy and by postoperative day #3 the patient had
completed Level 5 with physical therapy which included
walking 500 feet and climbing six stairs.  On the evening of
postoperative day #2 the patient was noted to have a lowgrade
fever of 101.3.  Chest x-ray at that time was significant
only for bibasilar atelectasis and small bilateral pleural
effusions.  The patient's white blood cell count on [**7-5**]
was 6.4, urinalysis from postoperative day #2 was negative.
The patient was encouraged to continue ambulation and use his
incentive spirometry.  Overall the patient was without
clinical signs of infectious process.  The patient will
continue to have his temperature monitored through the night
of postoperative day #3 into postoperative day #4.  If the
patient remains afebrile, the patient will be cleared for
discharge to home on [**2182-7-6**].
