Allergies:
Bacitracin

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3256**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of Breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
85 yo F w/ PMH significant for severe pulmonary fibrosis on 5L
NC at baseline (up to 9 L if exercising) and prednisone 15mg qam
and 5mg qpm, pulmonary hypertension with biventricular
dilatation, and pulmonary embolism and DVT in [**2192-12-13**] s/p
IVC filter and six months of warfarin stopped in [**Month (only) 205**], and
history of GI bleed, now transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for respiratory
distress.
Pt was feeling short of breath for several days at home. She did
not have any fevers, chills, or significant change in her cough,
but she was very dyspneic. She normally uses 5L nc at rest but
still felt very uncomfortable. Satting at home in 80s, took a
while to get back up to 90s. Pt had one episode of blood
streaked mucus. Today reported worsening SOB sats in 80s, didn't
improve w/ NC but did improve with simple face mask. Pt had
recurrent urinary tract infections and was on nitrofurantoin for
3 days (was also taking unclear antibiotic previously). Pt call
an ambulance and her sats improved with NRB mask by EMS. She was
brought to ED for further evaluation.

Of note, she was diagnosed with a pulmonary embolism and DVT
during her hospitalization in [**2192-12-13**]. She had a right-sided
pulmonary emboli involving the right upper, middle, and lower
lobes, with findings concerning for right heart strain on echo.
This was an unprovoked pulmonary embolism, and Pt was treated
with an IVC filter given her extensive DVT and PE and poor
respiratory reserve. Pt was also anticoagulated for 6 months on
warfarin, which she stopped on [**2193-7-20**] after discussion w/
pulmonologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 575**]. Pt previously had a history of GI
bleed prior to start of warfarin attributed to gastritis /
peptic ulcer disease secondary to steroids and aspirin.

- HL
- severe lower back pain

- thyroid nodule
- h/o pontine stroke ([**2186**]) - residual mild left hemiparesis
- submassive PE and DVT [**12-24**], on anticoagulation with IVC
filter placed at that time --> plan to stop soon.
- History of GI bleed, likely due to prior nonsteroidal
anti-inflammatory drug therapy.
- CAD

since [**2159**]. She has two daughters, one who lives in
[**State 350**], and another who lives in [**State 5887**]. She has a
son who lives in [**Name (NI) 12000**]. She smoked only for 10 years and quit
40 years ago. She reports [**2-15**] glasses of wine per week.

Family History:
No family history of blood clots or strokes. She reports a
cousin has [**Name2 (NI) 500**] cancer but denies other cancer in the family.
She also notes several family members have heart disease.

(Final [**2193-9-30**]):    NO GROWTH.

Imaging:
CXR [**2193-9-29**]: IMPRESSION:  Findings compatible with pulmonary
edema superimposed on known background of interstitial fibrosis.
Please refer to subsequent CT chest for further details.

CTA [**2193-9-29**]: IMPRESSION:
1.  Pulmonary emboli in the segmental branch supplying the
posterobasal
segment of the right lower lobe and the lateral segment of the
right middle lobe.
2.  Acute pulmonary edema superimposed on a background of
pulmonary fibrosis. 3.  Dilated main pulmonary artery with
associated aneurysmatic dilatation of the right pulmonary artery
as well as tortuous distal arteries suggest longstanding
pulmonary hypertension.

These findings were communicated via telephone immediately after
discovery of the findings by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on
[**2193-9-29**] at 5:25 p.m. via
telephone.

TTE [**2193-9-30**]: The left atrium is elongated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity
size are normal. There is mild regional left ventricular
systolic dysfunction with basal to mid inferior and inferoseptal
hypokinesis. The right ventricular cavity is moderately dilated
with depressed free wall contractility. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
present. Mild to moderate ([**1-14**]+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no pericardial effusion. IMPRESSION: mild
focal left ventricular systolic dysfunction. Dilated and
hypokinetic right ventricle. Mild to moderate aortic
regurgitation. Mild mitral regurgitation. Compared with the
prior study (images reviewed) of [**2193-1-12**], image quality is
improved from prior (though still not optimal). The basal/mid
inferior wall may have been hypokinetic on the prior also. Right
ventricular function appears worse on the current study.
Pulmonary artery pressures could not be estimated on the current
study.

LENIs [**2193-9-30**]: IMPRESSION:  No evidence of deep vein thrombosis
either right or left lower extremity.
