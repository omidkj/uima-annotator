Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Sulfa (Sulfonamide Antibiotics)

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5893**]
Chief Complaint:
Septic/Cardiogenic Shock

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
endotracheal intubation

History of Present Illness:
67 yo F with h/o CHF and amyloidosis receiving chemotherapy at
[**Hospital1 18**] presents with altered mental status and increasing LBP x 5
days with some new bowel/bladder incontinence and LE weakness.
.
Mrs. [**Known lastname **] started her first cycle of Velcade / Decadron
chemotherapy regimen 1 month ago and last dose was 10 days ago.
Over the last 5 days she experienced worsening back pain and
lower extremity weakness. She has become confused with an
altered mental status according to her husband and developed new
bowel and bladder incontinence 1 day prior to presentation.
.
The patient presented to [**Location (un) **] in a hypotensive state with
ARDS/pul edema on CXR. Initially, pneumonia vs CHF was
considered. The pt was given lasix, IVF, ceftazidime and
levaquin. Because of patients acute change in mental status, the
pt was given a full dose ASA and sent for head CT which was
negative. A U/A positive for blood. The pt was deemed to have
[**3-10**] BLE weakness and after decadron 10mg IV she was transferred
to [**Hospital1 **] for possible cauda equina vs. sepsis. The patient was
incontinent of stool en route.
.
In the ED, initial vs were: 99 76 85/41 18 100% on NRB.
Initially the patient was confused but A&Ox3 and complained only
of fatigue and aching in low back. Neuro exam revealed
weak-normal rectal tone and LE weakness, but normal reflexes and
sensation. CXR in ED was consistent with CHF. BNP was [**Numeric Identifier **]
(previously [**Numeric Identifier 890**] in [**2164**]). EKG V-paced but does not ST criteria
for STEMI. Troponin was 0.15 here (trop at [**Location (un) **] higher, but
they may be using a different assay). Because of concern for a
possible epidural abscess, the pt was sent for CT of full (C, T
and L) spine that showed no obvious fluid collections. The
patient cannot be sent for MRI because she has a pacemaker. She
started on vancomycin and received a 500cc NS bolus, had a right
IJ line place and was started on levophed. SBP rose to 110s with
an SpO2 98% on 4L NC with RR 20. She was transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for
hemodynamic instability and concern for sepsis vs. cardiogenic
shock. On transfer, her vitals were 95.3F 61 102/59 19 95% on 5L
O2 by NC.
.
On the floor, pt is alert, but disoriented on 0.06mcg/kg/min
levophed with a warming blanket for hypothermia.

Past Medical History:
1) Primary amyloidosis diagnosed in [**2163**]. Renal biopsy
showed a lambda light chain deposition and she had light chains
in her urine.  At that time, she has had marked lower extremity
edema and recurrent infections.  She ultimately had her stem
cells mobilized with Cytoxan and underwent autologous stem cell
transplant with melphalan as her conditioning regimen.
Transplant was complicated by GI bleed and ICU admission;
however, she was ultimately discharged and has been doing quite
well since transplant.
2) Pacemaker for symptomatic sinus block early [**2169-5-6**]
3) CHF
4) HTN
5) High cholesterol
6) Left wrist fracture
7) History of premature ventricular complexes
8) History of duodenal ulcer
9) Multiple bilateral breast cysts: Biopsies negative for
cancer.
10) tendon repair right leg in [**2139**]'s

Imaging:
CT spine [**10-12**]: No evidence of fracture or fluid collection of
the cervical spine.

Echo [**10-13**]:  IMPRESSION: amyloid heart

CT head [**10-13**]:  no acute process

BAL cytology [**10-14**]: NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS. Macrophages,
some hemosiderin-laden, lymphocytes and neutrophils

CT head [**10-17**]: IMPRESSIONS: Newly apparent loss of [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white
matter differentiation along the posterior right MCA vascular
distribution raises concern for interval infarction, not
previously seen on [**2169-10-13**]. No acute intracranial hemorrhage or
shift of normally midline structures. MRI recommended for more
sensitive evaluation of infarction if patient's cardiac
pacemaker is MRI-compatible.

IMPRESSION:
Extensive bilateral
