Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1631**]
Chief Complaint:
Hypotension at rehab.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Central venous line placement.


History of Present Illness:
This is a [**Age over 90 **] yo woman with history of stroke, atrial
fibrillation on coumadin, CHF, COPD, Crohn's disease, and
uterine cancer sent in from [**Hospital 100**] rehab for BP of 70/40, HR 65
(on digoxin), 92% on RA. Received IV fluids, and hours later, BP
continued to be 70/40. Patient complained of headache, which is
baseline for her.

Per [**Hospital 100**] rehab, patient has had altered mental status and was
being treated for COPD flare for one day with albuterol and
atrovent q4 hours. Hx of dementia and cognitive decline but
unclear baseline. Patient denies chest pain, nausea, vomiting,
or diarrhea. She does have shortness of breath with a cough,
though has been afebrile. Of note patient has a 100 pack-year
smoking history.

In the ED, initial vs were: T 97.6 P 95 BP 83/58 R 18 O2 97% on
RA. HR was irregularly irregular. EKG showed atrial fibrillation
without ST segment changes. CXR shows a ?L basilar opacity.
Patient was given 2L IV fluids, without improvement in blood
pressure. Levophed was started peripherally. A R IJ central line
was placed, along with 2 peripheral IVs. After starting
Levophed, BP was 96/71, HR 93, 97% on 2L. The patient was
started on Vanc/Zosyn empirically for pneumonia.

On the floor, patient is able to respond to questions but with
confusion. Unable to provide further history.

Micro Data:

Blood and urine cultures: negative
Urine legionella: negative
MRSA screen: positive

Imaging Studies:

CXR ([**4-23**]): Left basilar opacity, which may represent
atelectasis, but infection is not completely excluded. No
evidence for congestive heart failure.

CXR ([**4-28**]): Patient's condition required AP and lateral chest
examination while patient is sitting in wheelchair. Comparison
is made with a preceding single AP chest view of [**2118-4-26**].
Previously described left lower lung field density obliterating
diaphragmatic contour and presenting as retrocardiac density
persists. Presence of barium contrast, apparently used for an
oropharyngeal video study earlier during the day, discloses
sizable hiatal hernia which apparently contributions to this
retrocardiac density. Heart size has not changed and previously
described general widening and elongation of thoracic aorta
remains the same. Pulmonary vasculature is not congested. No new
parenchymal infiltrates are seen. Mild blunting of right lateral
and posterior pleural sinus is present. No pneumothorax
identified.

CXR ([**4-30**]): Large hiatal hernia. Adjacent basilar lung
opacification,
probably atelectasis although aspiration pneumonia is not fully
excluded.
Small pleural effusions with improvement on the right.

Brief Hospital Course:
A [**Age over 90 **] yo woman history of atrial fibrillation on coumadin,
dementia, COPD, diastolic CHF now presenting with hypotension
and hypoxia from rehab.

# Hypotension: Her blood pressure per NH report was 70/40.
Despite IV fluids in ED, BP was not responsive. A central line
was placed and she was started on Levophed. Differential
includes most likely septic shock from pulmonary source.
Potential other etiologies were adrenal insufficiency,
cardiogenic shock secondary to decomensated CHF or MI, and less
likely PE. CXR showed left lower lobe infiltrate, concerning for
pneumonia, along with SOB and cough. Blood and urine cultures
were sent. Cortisol level was normal. She was started
empirically on Vanc/Zosyn for health-care associated pneumonia.
In addition, she was started on IV Solumedrol and standing nebs
for presumptive COPD flare and given small boluses of IV Lasix
(when blood pressure came up) for possible component of
decompensated CHF. With the above interventions her blood
pressure improved to 95-110s systolic, and her mental status
improved. She has completed a seven-day course of antibiotics at
time of discharge; steroids were stopped prior to discharge and
Lasix has been stopped due to concern of intravascular volume
depletion based on labs. Her systolic blood pressure as time of
discharge is in the high 90s to low 100s.

# Altered mental status: She has mild dementia, likely
compounded by hearing loss; per NH report she is alert and
oriented to person, place and time at baseline. At time of
admission she was somnolent. Neuro exam was non-focal and LFTs
were unremarkable. Her electrolytes showed a mild hypernatremia,
which corrected with IV D5W. Her mental status gradually
improved with treatment of infection and hypernatremia. At time
of discharge, she is alert to person and time, although confused
as to place. She has passed speech and swallow evaluation and is
tolerating oral diet without problem.

# Microcytic Anemia: Her baseline hematocrit is in the low 30s.
Hematocrit on this admission was 28.8. Given the hypotension at
admission, there was concern that blood loss might be
contributing. Iron studies were indicative of deficiency (see
above). Her hematocrit remained stable, and her blood pressure
came up with treatment of infection. There were no blood
transfusions necessary.

# Acute renal failure: Her baseline creatinine is 0.9-1.1.
