HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 53-year-old
gentleman with hypertension, dyslipidemia, and a tobacco
history who was in his usual state of health until 10 a.m. on
the day of presentation when he developed substernal chest
pressure while lobster trapping.

The pain was squeezing.  It did not radiate.  It was
associated with shortness of breath and diaphoresis, but no
nausea or vomiting.  He was brought to the [**Hospital3 3583**] at
which time his electrocardiogram showed inferior ST
elevations, and he was started on Aggrastat, aspirin,
heparin, nitroglycerin drip and was transferred to [**Hospital1 1444**] for further evaluation.

In the Cardiac Catheterization Laboratory, the patient was
found to have total occlusion of the right posterior
descending artery which was treated with a 3-mm X 18-mm
Hepacoat stent which was post dilated to 3.5 mm.  He also had
diffuse 30% to 70% left anterior descending artery disease
which was not treated at the time.  A right heart
catheterization revealed a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure
of approximately 22.  The patient was given 10 mg of
intravenous Lasix in the Catheterization Laboratory and was
subsequently transferred to the Coronary Care Unit for
further management.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Remote history of a seizure disorder.
2.  Hypertension.
3.  Dyslipidemia.
4.  Hypothyroidism.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Atenolol, Synthroid, aspirin
(which he recently stopped), atorvastatin, and phenytoin.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Physical examination
with vital signs which revealed the patient's temperature was
afebrile, his heart rate was 73, his blood pressure was
99/40, and his oxygen saturation was 99% on 2 liters via
nasal cannula.  In general, the patient was a middle-aged
gentleman in no apparent distress.  Head, eyes, ears, nose,
and throat examination revealed normocephalic and atraumatic.
The extraocular movements were intact.  The oropharynx was
clear.  The neck was supple.  No bruits.  No lymphadenopathy.
No jugular venous distention.  Chest examination revealed the
lungs were clear to auscultation.  Cardiovascular examination
revealed a regular rate.  Normal first heart sounds and
second heart sounds.  No murmurs, rubs, or gallops.  No third
heart sound.  Abdominal examination revealed the abdomen was
obese, soft, nontender, and nondistended.  There were
positive bowel sounds.  The right groin was without hematoma
or bruits.  One femoral in place.  Extremity examination
revealed the extremities were warm and well perfused.  No
clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.  There were palpable pulses
bilaterally (dorsalis pedis).  Neurologic examination
revealed the patient was alert and oriented times three.
Cranial nerves II through XII were intact.  The patient was
moving all extremities.

PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:  Creatine kinase
was 3030, MB was 240, and troponin was 11.41.  Phenytoin was
4.4.

PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  Electrocardiogram status post
intervention revealed a sinus rhythm at 79.  Q waves in leads
II, III, and aVF.  Resolution of ST elevations.  Left atrial
dilatation.

CONCISE SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE BY ISSUE/SYSTEM:

1.  ST-ELEVATION MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION ISSUES:  The patient
did well status post cardiac catheterization and stent.  He
was continued on Plavix, aspirin, and beta blocker.  He was
started on an ACE inhibitor and was continued on his statin.

The patient's creatine kinase had peaked on admission at
3030.  He had no further episodes of chest pain.  The patient
was discharged with plans to follow up for cardiac
rehabilitation.

2.  HYPERLIPIDEMIA ISSUES:  Despite the patient's
atorvastatin, his lipid profile remained elevated.  This was
to be followed on an outpatient basis and in cardiac
rehabilitation.

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  Condition on discharge was good.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  Discharge status was to home.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Inferior wall ST-elevation myocardial infarction.
2.  Dyslipidemia.
3.  Seizure disorder.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
 1.  Aspirin 325 mg by mouth once per day.
 2.  Clopidogrel 75 mg by mouth once per day.
 3.  Phenytoin 200 mg by mouth in the morning.
 4.  Metoprolol 25 mg by mouth twice per day.
 5.  Atorvastatin 40 mg by mouth once per day.
 6.  Levothyroxine 250 mcg by mouth every day.
 7.  Multivitamin one tablet by mouth once per day.
 8.  Nitroglycerin sublingually as needed.
 9.  Phenytoin 300 mg by mouth in the evening.
10.  Lisinopril 5 mg by mouth once per day.
11.  Fenofibrate 54 mg by mouth every day.
