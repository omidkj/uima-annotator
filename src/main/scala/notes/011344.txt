Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea on exertion


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2105-9-4**] Aortic valve replacement with a 25-mm On-X mechanical
 valve; Pericardial reconstruction using the core matrix
pericardial


History of Present Illness:
64 year old male who has been followed by serial echocardiograms
for several years because possibility of bicuspid aortic valve
disease. In the fall of [**2104**] he began having symptoms of dyspnea
on exertion. He decreased his activity and his symptoms have
subsequently decreased. However when he over-exerts himself,
such as mowing his lawn, he significant develops dyspnea on
exertion. He denies chest pain, syncope, orthopnea, PND and
pedal edema. His most recent echocardiogram in [**2104-11-14**]
showed a trileaflet aortic valve with severe aortic stenosis. He
was advised to undergo aortic valve replacement in [**2105-2-14**]
but because of personal situations he delayed his surgery.

Pertinent Results:
[**2105-9-4**] Intraop TEE
PRE-BYPASS:
No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of
the left atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of the right
atrium/right atrial appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen
by 2D or color Doppler.

There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal
cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.

The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. There are focal
calcifications in the aortic arch. The aortic valve is bicuspid.


The aortic valve leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. There
is severe aortic valve stenosis (valve area 0.8-1.0cm2).
Mild to moderate ([**2-15**]+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial mitral
regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.

POST-BYPASS:
Preserved biventricular systolic function.
LVEF 55%.
There is a bimetallic prosthesis seen at the native aortic
position, stable and f unctioning well. Residual mean gradient
is 12 mm of Hg.
Intact thoracic aorta.

Brief Hospital Course:
Admitted [**2105-9-4**] and underwent surgery with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 914**]. For
surgical details, please see operative note. Following surgery,
he was transferred to the CVICU in stable condition on titrated
propofol and phenylephrine drips. Extubated later that day and
transferred to the floor on POD #1 to begin increasing his
activity level. Beta blockade slowly initiated and Warfarin
started on POD #2 for mechanical aortic valve. He was bridged
with IV heparin until therapeutic. INR was monitored daily and
Warfarin was dosed for a goal INR between 2.0 - 2.5. Chest tubes
and pacing wires removed per protocol. Over several days, he
continued to make clinical improvements with diuresis and was
cleared for discharge to home on postoperative day six when his
INR rose over 2.0. Prior to discharge, arrangements were made
with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 89337**] and the [**Hospital1 **] Coumadin Clinc to
monitor Warfarin as an outpatient. At discharge, he was in a
normal sinus rhythm with 1+ pedal edema and oxygen saturations
of 97% on room air. All wounds were clean, dry and intact.
