Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 12**]
Chief Complaint:
Diarrhea, Weakness, Anemia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Port-a-cath placement.

History of Present Illness:
69 yo F with h/o Anaplastic large cell lymphoma and granuloma
annulare who presents with fatigue and weakness x 2-3 days. Pt
is poor historian but notes weakness x 2-3 days. She also notes
loose stools over this time period. She denies fevers, chills,
night sweats. She denies chest pain, shortness of breath, cough.
She denies melena, hematochezia, brbpr. She denies dysruia. Per
the patient's son, she has had no PO intake and has not got OOB
x 2 weeks. She also has occcassional urinary/fecal incontinence.
In the am of admission, she slipped and fell on leg. No LOC,
head trauma.
In [**Name (NI) **], pt was found to have diarrhea and poor rectal tone, neuro
consulted.
--CT head-multiple lytic lesions seen in the right parietal and
both occipital bones.
--CT C-spine - Multiple lytic lesions seen in the occipital
bones bilaterally and lateral mass of C1
--MRI L-spine - Degenerative changes seen in the lower lumbar
spine with no evidence of nerve root compression. Diffuse
mottled appearance seen within the vertebral bodies, the sacrum,
and both iliac bones is nonspecific in etiology. This can be
seen in diffuse osteopenia, myeloproliferative or lymphomatous
involvement of the osseous structures.
She also had a hematocrit of 19 and then 15 with fluids with LDH
380, I. Bili 1.3, INR 1.6. The patient was transfused 1 U PRBC.

She also had elevated LFTs:
--RUQ US - Multiple ill-defined small hypoechoic lesions
throughout the right lobe of the liver and surrounding the
gallbladder fossa.
--CT ABD - Diffuse stranding in the mesentery, which could
suggest infiltration by neoplastic process or fluid. Progressive
retroperitoneal and inguinal lymphadenopathy.
.
Pt admitted to MICU for ? cord compression and hypotension with
anemia. Found to be OB neg, received 4 units PRBC and ruled out
for cord compression. Transfered to medical floor once HD
stable. In addition, pt found to have PNA with hx of exposure to
Pertussis.

Physical Exam:
Vitals: T99.8, BP: 130/50, HR: 107, RR: 26, O2 98% RA.
GEN: Moderately ill appearing female in NAD, mildly tachypneic,
no use of accessory muscles, speaking in full sentences.
HEENT: Pupils equal and reactive, MM dry, neck is supple with no
LAD.
CV: Tachy, reg, 1/6 SEM at axilla.

appreciated.
ABD: NDNT, normoactive BS, soft. No masses appreciated.
EXT: trace pedal edema, warm and well perfused. L inguinal LAD
with skin changes. 4-5 cm ulcerative lesion on R calf with
surrounding erythema and lichenifcation of skin. Pt also has
mult areas on both upper ext with scaly lesions.
Neuro: A&Ox3 and appropriate. Moving all ext with normal
strength.


Pertinent Results:
CXR [**2151-5-20**]: FINDINGS: There is interval increase in the left
retrocardiac opacity with associated left pleural effusion. This
is consistent with an evolving pneumonia. There is prominence of
the pulmonary vasculature, suggestive of mild CHF. The soft
tissue and osseous structures are unchanged. No pneumothorax is
seen.

IMPRESSION: Left retrocardiac opacity and associated left
pleural effusion, which is increased in comparison to the prior
study, likely representing an evolving pneumonia. There is mild
prominence of the pulmonary vasculature, suggestive of
associated mild CHF.
.
.
CT Head: FINDINGS: No previous examination available for
comparison.

White and [**Doctor Last Name 352**] matter differentiation is preserved. No
intracranial masses effect and no hemorrhage is seen. Midline
structures are normal in position. Ventricles and subarachnoid
spaces are within normal limits. No findings to suggest an acute
territorial infarction are noted. MRI is more sensitive to
detect acute infarction, consider this if clinically indicated.

Bone windows demonstrated lytic lesion seen in the left parietal
skull measuring approximately 1 cm in diameter. Multiple
additional lytic lesions are seen in the occipital bones
bilaterally. Clinical correlation is necessary..
.
.
RUQ ultrasound: IMPRESSION:
1) No evidence of cholecystitis, cholelithiasis, or
choledocholithiasis. Tiny comet tail artifact likely secondary
to an adherent crystal versus a small cholesterol polyp.
2) Multiple ill-defined small hypoechoic lesions throughout the
right lobe of the liver and surrounding the gallbladder fossa.
These may be secondary to focal fatty sparing, however, given
the history of lymphoma a CT or MRI is recommended for
definitive characterization.
.
.
CT pelvis:
IMPRESSION:
1) No evidence of retroperitoneal hematoma.
2) Diffuse stranding, likely related to third-spacing.
3) Progressive retroperitoneal and right inguinal
lymphadenopathy, concerning for relapsed lymphoma; slight
improvement in size of left inguinal adenopathy. This unexpected
finding was discussed with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] in the morning of [**5-20**], [**2150**].
4) Diverticulosis.
5) Similar appearance of left adnexal cyst.
6) Liver lesions not assessed without intravenous contrast.

Mild mucosal thickening is seen involving both posterior ethmoid
sinuses. Small fluid level is seen within the left sphenoid
sinus and inferior left maxillary sinus.

INTERPRETATION:
1) No acute intracranial abnormalities.
2) Multiple lytic lesions seen in the right parietal and both
occipital bones, clinical correlation is necessary.

Pelvic U/S:
Transabdominal ultrasound demonstrates a uterus measuring 5.7 x
3.1 x 5.7 cm. No fibroids are identified. The endometrium is
heterogeneous and thickened as it is seen transabdominally,
measuring 1.4 cm. There are echogenic foci within the
myometrium. The right ovary is not identified. A rounded left
adnexal cyst is seen, measuring approximately 2.4 cm in
diameter. This corresponds to a left adnexal cyst seen on the
recent CT exam. The left ovary itself is not clearly identified.
Transvaginal examination was declined by the patient.

IMPRESSION:
1. Thickened heterogeneous endometrium. The differential
diagnosis includes endometrial hyperplasia, carcinoma,
adenomyosis, or polyp. Further evaluation with MRI could be
considered. This exam is limited as the patient declined
transvaginal exam.
2. Left adnexal cyst. The ovaries are not clearly identified

Brief Hospital Course:
A 69-year-old female with past medical history significant for
anaplastic large cell lymphoma, granuloma annulare, who
presented with weakness, anemia, and hypertension.
.
BRIEF HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM:
.
1.  Anaplastic large cell lymphoma:  The patient has been
treated in the past with methotrexate successfully.  During this
admission, she was found to have a white blood cell count that
was consistently trending upwards, even with broad-spectrum
antibiotics.  After the patient had received approximately 14
days of broad-spectrum antibiotics, it was felt that this rising
white blood count was likely secondary to reactive leukocytosis.
 The patient did not have any abnormal cells on blood smear;
however, it was noted that she had new lymphadenopathy on the
right side in the inguinal re
