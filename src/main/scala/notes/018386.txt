COMMENTS:
1- Selective coronary angiography of this right-dominant system
demonstrated acute thrombotic occlusion of the proximal LAD and
TIMI 0
flow throuhghout the LAD system beyong the occlusion. The LCX
and RCA
were free from angiographic disease.
2- Limited resting hemodynamic assessment showed markedly
elevated
left-sided filling pressures (mPCWP 25 mmHg), normal right-sided
filling
pressures (RVEDP 5 mmHG), mild pulmonary HTN (36/26 mmHg) and
preserved
cardiac output (5.3 L/min) and cardiac index (2.5 L/min/m2).
3- Successful percutaneous thrombectomy of the LAD and diagonal
with
restoration of TIMI 3 flow. Final angiography showed no stenotic
lesions
at the thrombus site. No dissection or distal emboli.
4- Successful deployment of a 6 French Angioseal to the RCFA.
.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Complete thrombotic occlusion of the proximal LAD.
2. Successful percutaneous thrombectomy of the LAD and diagonal
branch
3. Successful deployment of a 6 French Angioseal closure device
.
TTE
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There is severe regional
left ventricular systolic dysfunction with akinesis of the mid
to distal anterior wall, anterior septum and lateral wall. The
basal anterior and anteroseptal, distal inferior and
inferolateral segments are hypokinetic. A left ventricular
thrombus cannot be excluded. There is no ventricular septal
defect. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal. The number of aortic valve leaflets cannot be
determined. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears structurally
normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. The pulmonary artery
systolic pressure could not be determined. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
.
IMPRESSION: Severe focal LV systolic dysfunction consistent with
large LAD territory infarction. No significant valvular
abnormality seen.  EF 20%

Brief Hospital Course:
In brief, this is a 30 year old man with history of cocaine
abuse who presented with STEMI and found to have a LAD thrombus.
His STEMI was associated with cocaine and ETOH use.  He is
currently s/p thrombectomy.  His post cath course was
complicated by cardiogenic shock and a Swan-Ganz was placed for
monitoring.  His shock improved with furosemide diuresis and
afterload reduction with ACEI.  He was also noted to have mild
respiratory distress that was atributed to a combination of
pulmonary edema and atelectasis.  Also, the patient experienced
two episodes of emesis while hospitalized and there was concern
for aspiration pneumonia.  He was empirically treated with
levofloxacin and metronidazole.  His respiratory status improved
with these interventions.  Post catheterization the patient was
mantained on therapeutic anticoagulation with heparin gtt and
bridged to warfarin.  The reason for this intervention was his
low EF of 20% with anterior/apical akinesis and subsequent
concern for LV thrombosis.  Of note, upon initial presentation
to OSH ED, he experienced a cardiac arrest with torsades de
pointes/VF, which was treated with defibrillation and magnesium.
 He remained in sinus rhythm during this hospitalization.  Given
his ETOH abuse he was maintained on a diazepam scale for
withdrawl symptoms.  The medical regimen on discharge includes
ASA, metoprolol, lisinopril, clopidogrel, atorvastatin,
epleronone, furosemide and warfarin. He was strongly advised to
abstain from cocaine and alcohol abuse in order to prevent
further morbitity.  Dr. [**Last Name (
