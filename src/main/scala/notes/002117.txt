Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1377**]
Chief Complaint:
Diarrhea and abdominal pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation, central line placement, dialysis catheter placement

History of Present Illness:
51 yo m w/ PMH HIV (last CD4 53 in [**4-22**], on [**Date Range 97504**]), Hep C/HCC
cirrhosis s/p liver xplant in [**1-21**] c/b biliary leak s/p ERCP,
s/p Roux-en-Y, s/p T-tube placement, recurrent c diff.  Due to
elev liver enzymes is found to have recurrent HCV.  Admitted [**7-24**]
w/ diarrhea and abd pain.  Noted at that time to have renal
failure (Cr 2.1, baseline 1.1-1.3), low bicarb (HCO3 at 13 down
from baseline 18-20), AG = 16, elevated AST (65 -> 141),
elevated T bili 1.4 -> 7.7, elevated INR to 1.9.  Since
admission his Cr has steadily worsened and the patient has
become oliguric.  Now approx 4.2L positive.  Noted to have ? RLL
infiltrate and was started on levofloxacin.  Had been
oxygenating well on RA.  Yesterday developed new O2 requirement
(2L) which was increased this evening to 5L NC.  Noted to have
dramatically increased secretions.  Reports that he is
increasingly SOB.  Denies CP. Patient refusing to answer further
questions.

DUPLEX DOPPLER LIVER ULTRASOUND:

The liver parenchyma is normal in echotexture, unchanged
compared to prior
study.  No focal lesions are identified.  The right, left, and
main hepatic
veins are patent and demonstrate normal flow and waveforms.  The
portal venous
vasculature is patent.  The main, left and right hepatic
arteries demonstrate
normal waveforms with resistive indices between 0.79 - 0.89. The
IVC is
patent.

IMPRESSION:

Similar appearance of transplanted liver with patent hepatic
vasculature.
.
ECHO
1.There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular
cavity size is normal. Left ventricular systolic function is
hyperdynamic
(EF>75%).
2.There is a small to moderate sized pericardial effusion. There
are no
echocardiographic signs of tamponade.

Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed)
of [**2132-7-29**],
the pericardial effusion appears slightly increased


Brief Hospital Course:
51 yo m w/ Hep C/HCC cirrhosis, HIV, recurrent c diff, s/p liver
xplant in [**1-21**] with extended post-transplant course, transferred
for mild resp distress.
.
Pt's respiratory distress initially improved dramatically with
aggressive chest PT.  antibiotics were expanded to vancomycin
and zosyn for empiric therapy of PNA, given new fever, ?
infiltrate assoc w/ R pleural effusion and elev wbc. ARF -
ulytes c/w prerenal etiology.  Following admission to ICU,
patient underwent volume challenge with 1.5 L NS w/ 3 amps
bicarb.  UO increased transiently with this and Cr stabilized.
Altered mental status- felt to be [**12-20**] liver dz, renal failure,
and pna.  risks of sedation felt to be high enough that head CT
was not obtained (patient refused test) and exam more c/w
delerium. Lactulose was titrated. S/p liver transplant -prograf
held following initial transfer due to elev levels. Re-started
on [**7-30**].  pegsasys continued to be held in unit. Diarrhea/c
diff- on transfer was on standing loperamide and vancomycin
taper.  on  transfer loperamide held, pt w/o diarrhea. Continued
on standing p.o. vancomycin. Metablolic acidosis- unclear
etiology.  Combined anion and non-anion gap.  bicarb improved w/
1.5L of NaHCO3 (3amps) from 12 to 18 however non-gap acidosis
increased slightly (likely dilutional). HIV: Pt on lamivudine,
efavirenz, abacavir as outpt, followed by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 724**].
Hct drop - on [**7-30**] noted to have hct drop, guiac +. pt
non-compliant with NGT placement.  The pt subsequently developed
a large GIB. EGD consistent with cultiple acute superficial
ulcers 3-10mm were found in the first part of the duodenum and
second part of the duodenum. There were stigmata of recent
bleeding. Pt was intubated for airway protection but aspirated
in the context of the event. Pt was aggressively fluid
resusciated and only transiently required pressors. A dialysis
catheter was placed in the attempt to remove fluid as pt
anasarcic and in persistent renal failure. As the pt did not
show any improvement and prognosis was infaust, decision was
made with the family to withdraw all measure. The pt expired
within minutes of extubation.
