underwent chemotherapy
and radiation therapy and he was at that time refusing surgery.
However, a few months after completing his chemotherapy and
radiation, he presented with malaise, cough and episodes of
hemoptysis and after further discussion, he
decided to proceed with a left pneumonectomy for an extensive
tumor that was in the left upper lobe but also invading the
airway.

history; however, he did smoke a pipe on a daily basis up until

CXR:
[**2146-4-21**]: Status post left pneumonectomy with air-fluid level at
approximately the AP window level. No radiographic evidence of
post-surgical complications. Expected subcutaneous emphysema in
the left chest wall.
[**2146-4-19**]: The current study demonstrates gradual increase in the
opacification of the left hemithorax with no change in the
position of the mediastinum, findings expected after
pneumonectomy. On the other hand,there is increase in the
subcutaneous air compared to the prior study that might be
partially related to removal of the chest tube. There is no
abnormality seen in the right hemithorax. The post-pneumonectomy
stem appears to be unremarkable within the limitation of this
radiograph.
[**2146-4-19**]: No evidence of mediastinal widening or shift. Minimal
atelectatic change at the right base.




Brief Hospital Course:
[**4-18**] Pt was admitted for Left pneumonectomy for NSCLC.  The

removed. He voided without difficulty.
POD4 He was seen by physical therapy.  He remained in atrial
fibrillation.  His home coumadin was restarted.
POD5 Pt converted to sinus, his coumadin was dosed, INR was
checked, pain was contreolled with PO medications, ambulated
