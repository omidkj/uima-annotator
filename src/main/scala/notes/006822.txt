ERCP

History of Present Illness:
This is a 86 year-old female with a history of mild CHF,
diverticulitis who was transfered from OSH with
cholangitis/choledocolithiasis for ERCP. The patient reports
that she has been having watery diarrhea, gas and mild abd pain
for several weeks - stopped taking lasix [**1-2**] diarrhea. She
recently saw her PCP who had placed her on two antibiotics. Her
diarrhea began to resolve. However, she then underwent a abd CT
scan with barium on [**2157-11-21**] and then began having diarrhea
since then. She saw her PCP again on [**2157-11-29**] and was doing
well. On her return home, she began to feel very weak. Her
daughter, a nurse, noted that she was unstable, confused and had
her BIBA to an OSH ED. There she  had a repeat CT scan and RUQ
showing common bile duct stones. In addition, she had a fever to
105, abdominal pain and vomiting x 2 and was given Unasyn and
Levofloxacin. She was then transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] ED for ERCP.

In the ED, the patient was febrile to 103. RUQ U/S confirmed
choledocolithiasis. GI contact[**Name (NI) **] - ERCP when IR less than 1.5.
She was given tylenol and one liter IVF. On exam in the ED, she
was well appearing, mildly diffusely tender in her abd,
initially tachycardic to 155. She also had one large watery foul
smelling stool. Vitals: temp 100.1 Hr 95, Bp 110/50 19 97% 2L.

Ultrasound: The liver shows normal echogenicity. No focal
hepatic
lesion is identified. The intra- and extra-hepatic bile ducts
are dilated.
The common duct at the head of the pancreas measures 1 cm.
Multiple shadowing echogenic foci are identified within the
common bile duct consistent with stones. The gallbladder
contains multiple stones. There is no evidence of cholecystitis.
The visualized pancreas is normal. The right kidney measures
10.4 cm and shows mild dilatation of the collecting system and
ureter

ERCP:
Esophagus: Limited exam of the esophagus was normal
Stomach: Limited exam of the stomach was normal
Duodenum: Limited exam of the duodenum was normal
Major Papilla: Normal major papilla

Cannulation:  Cannulation of the biliary duct was successful and
deep with a sphincterotome using a free-hand technique. Contrast
medium was injected resulting in complete opacification.

Biliary Tree: Three stones ranging in size from 3mm to 6mm that
were causing partial obstruction were seen at the lower third of
the common bile duct and middle third of the common bile duct.
Otherwise the bile duct was normal. No pus was noted.

Procedures: A sphincterotomy was performed in the 12 o'clock
position using a sphincterotome over an existing guidewire. 3
stones were extracted successfully using a balloon. Occlusion
cholangiogram did not show any filling defects.

Impression: Stones in the bile duct, otherwise normal biliary
tree. No pus was seen. A biliary sphincterotomy was performed.
Stones were extracted using a balloon. (sphincterotomy, stone
extraction)

Recommendations: Absence of pus and normal LFTs do not eliminate
cholangitis as the cause of patients high fevers, but make it
less likely. Consider evaluation for colits given diarrhea and
thickening in the sigmoid colon on CT scan.

[**2157-12-3**] CT abd/pelvis with contrast:
STUDY: CT of the abdomen and pelvis.

HISTORY: 86-year-old female with recurrent diarrhea, fevers and
question of
colon mass seen at outside hospital.

COMPARISONS: None.

TECHNIQUE: Following the administration of intravenous contrast,
MDCT axial
images were acquired from the lung bases to the pubic symphysis.
Coronal and
sagittal reformatted images were then obtained.

CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST: Tiny bilateral pleural
effusions with
associated atelectasis are present at the lung bases. Left-sided
pneumobilia
which may relate to the patient's recent ERCP two days prior is
evident.
Minimal intrahepatic biliary dilatation is present. The liver is
otherwise
unremarkable without focal lesion. Layering gallstones are
evident. However,
the gallbladder is not distended and no wall edema or
pericholecystic fluid is
seen. The pancreatic duct is prominent at the level of the
pancreatic head
measuring 4 mm in diameter (2:26). The pancreatic duct at the
level of the
body and tail is normal in caliber. Mild stranding at the level
of the amuplla
is compatibel with recent ERCP. The spleen and adrenal glands
are
unremarkable. Several low- attenuation foci within the left
kidney are too
small to characterize but likely represent simple cysts. The
stomach and small
bowel are unremarkable. There is no free air within the abdomen.
The abdominal
portion of the colon is unremarkable.

CT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST: A few diverticula of the
sigmoid colon are
present. The wall of the sigmoid colon along the majority of its
entire
course is irregular and oral contrast material does not pass
distal to the
lower aspect. Several foci of probable extraluminal air are
noted along the
antimesenteric border (2:58). These may represent outpouchings
of the wall
and diverticula or contained perforation. A long segment of
sigmoid colonic
wall irregularity, extending to the rectosigmoid junction, spans
a distance of
approximately 7 mm and mild surrounding inflammatory change is
also evident.
The bladder is unremarkable, although it contains a moderate
amount of air. No
Foley catheter is seen. Intrapelvic loops of small bowel are
unremarkable. No
adnexal masses. No pathologically enlarged inguinal or pelvic
lymph nodes are
present.

OSSEOUS STRUCTURES: Degenerative change at the L2-3 level with
associated
endplate sclerosis. No suspicious lytic or blastic lesions.

IMPRESSION:
1. Long segment of lower sigmoid colonic wall irregularity and
possible
associated contained foci of extraluminal air. A few sigmoid
colonic
diverticula are noted. The differential diagnosis includes long
segment
diverticulitis with contained perforation, but given the
irregular appearance of the wall of the lower sigmoid colon in
particular, carcinoma must also be considered and direct
visualization via endoscopy is advised.
2. Pneumobilia likely relate
