no carotid bruits.  Lungs:  Crackles at the bases
bilaterally.  No wheezing.  Heart:  Regular rate and rhythm
with systolic murmur loudest at the left lower sternal
border.  There was a rub at the apex.  There was an S3.
There was no S4.  Abdomen:  There was a negative
hepatojugular reflux.  The liver was nonpulsatile.  The
abdomen was nontender, nondistended.  Extremities:  There was
no pedal edema.  Peripheral pulses were palpable.  There was
no clubbing.  There was ecchymosis over the right shoulder
and arm.  There was no edema in the left arm.  Neurologic:
The patient was alert and oriented times three.  There was no

normal.  Strength was [**5-12**] in the upper extremities
bilaterally.  Strength in the lower extremities was [**5-12**].  The

LABORATORY DATA:  White count 14.5, hematocrit 37, platelets
357,000.  INR 2.0.  PTT 33.  Sodium 136, potassium 4.8,
chloride 99, bicarbonate 26, BUN 20, creatinine 0.8, glucose
88.  CK 36.  Troponin 0.3.  Digoxin 0.6.

The chest x-ray showed an increased effusion on the right and
left side.  There was increased retrocardiac infiltrate and
mild diffuse interstitial pattern.  The [**Month/Day (1) **] leads were in
place.  The AICD was in place.

EKG:  There was increased QT interval initiating V tach.  The
device was unable to pace at a rhythm.  Shock delivered.  The
corrected QT interval was greater than 600 milliseconds.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the CCU for V
tach/torsades de [**Last Name (un) **].

1.   TORSADES:  The patient remained hemodynamically stable.
The patient was maintained on his lidocaine drip.  His
magnesium and potassium were repleted aggressively to a goal
of magnesium greater than 2.0 and potassium greater than 5.0.
His Amiodarone and digoxin were held.

The patient was seen by the EP Service and a [**Company 1543**]
dual-chamber biventricular ICD was placed.  The patient was
maintained on telemetry.  The patient was maintained on
mexiletine.

2.  INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  It was felt that the patient likely
had a pneumonia.  His sputum eventually grew out
Staphylococcus.  The patient was maintained on levofloxacin
and vancomycin for this.  A repeat chest x-ray done on
[**2110-3-3**] showed improving pneumonia.

3.  HYPOTENSION:  The patient was noted to be hypotensive to
the high 90s during the admission.  This was felt to be
secondary to his cardiomyopathy.  One of his Lasix doses was
held.  The patient was continued on spironolactone and
lisinopril.  He was encouraged to take p.o. intake.

DISPOSITION:  The patient was seen by Physiotherapy and it
was felt that the patient would benefit from a [**Hospital 3058**]
rehab.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Cardiomyopathy.
2.  Ventricular tachycardia/torsades de [**Last Name (un) **], status post

4.  Hypotension.
5.  Hypercholesterolemia.
6.  Decreased acuity of vision in the left eye.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Magnesium oxide 400 mg p.o. b.i.d.
