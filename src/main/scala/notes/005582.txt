CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Shortness of breath.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This 69 year-old man with end
stage renal disease on hemodialysis, coronary artery disease,
congestive heart failure, atrial fibrillation who was
recently admitted [**2-11**] for an infected AV graft, clot
and MSSA infection with septic pulmonary emboli.  This
admission required a MICU stay for increased oxygen
requirement as well as surgical removal of the infected AV
graft.  A transesophageal echocardiogram at that time did not
show any evidence of endocarditis and a bone scan was
negative for lytic lesions suspicious of osteomyelitis.  The
patient was discharged on [**2-21**] on a four week course
of Cefazolin for his MSSA infection.  The patient then
returned for this admission on [**3-3**] with one to two
days of shortness of breath, fevers, chills and productive
cough.  The patient denies chest pain, nausea, vomiting and
diarrhea, however, he did complain of worsening orthopnea.

the patient lived at home and was ambulatory.  He was a
former security officer and is retired.  He has a positive
history of tobacco use.  He has smoked one pack a day for 52
years.  Up until his recent admission he was a smoker.  He
reports occasional alcohol use.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Temperature 101.5.  Heart
rate 87.  Blood pressure 133/58.  Respiratory rate 20.
Oxygen saturation 100% on nonrebreather.  General middle aged
male sitting in mild respiratory distress.  HEENT pupils are
equal, round and reactive to light.  Clear oropharynx.
Supple neck.  No lymphadenopathy.  Cardiovascular examination
tachycardic, regular.  Pulmonary examination positive rhonchi
heard throughout.  Decreased air movement at the left middle
and lower lung fields.  Bibasilar crackles.  Abdomen soft,
nontender, nondistended.  Extremities trace bilateral edema.
Faint dorsalis pedis pulses.  Neurological examination alert
and oriented times three.  Cranial nerves II through XII are
intact.  Moves all four extremities.  Decreased sensation
over his feet.  Skin has multiple necrotic lesions on shin,
chest and feet.

LABORATORY:  White blood cell count 13.6 with 90% polys, 5%
lymphocytes, hematocrit 32.9, platelets 274, sodium 127,
potassium 6.7, chloride 92, bicarb 22, BUN 37, creatinine
4.2, glucose 317, free calcium 1.01. magnesium 1.4,
phosphorus 5.1, lactate 4.4.  Arterial blood gas on 100%
nonrebreather 7.46.  PCO2 28, PO2 100.  No gross liver
function test abnormalities.  Urinalysis was negative for
infection.  Chest x-ray revealed interval development of
opacification within the left mid lung field with air
bronchograms and a left sided pleural effusion.  Also there
was evidence of mild congestive heart failure.  CT of the
chest revealed no evidence of pulmonary emboli, new extensive
consolidation in the lingula and left lower lobes, new left
pleural effusion partially entrapped by consolidated lung and
unchanged multiple pulmonary nodules consistent with septic
emboli unchanged from the previous study.  Electrocardiogram
on admission revealed regular tachycardia most likely atrial
flutter with 2 to 1 block.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  1.  Sepsis:  The patient rapidly developed
respiratory distress, increasing tachypnea, tachycardia and
persistent fever.  He was treated aggressively based on the
sepsis protocol.  He had central intravenous access placed
and was intubated for airway protection.  He was started on
antibiotics to cover his previous MSSA infection as well as
to treat for a new community acquired or possibly nosocomial
pneumonia.  He was initially covered with Vancomycin and
Ceftriaxone, however, this was changed to Oxacillin and
Ceftriaxone after several days.  The patient underwent a
bronchoalveolar lavage on [**2182-3-5**], which revealed 2+
polys, but no microorganisms.  Legionella culture was
negative as well as negative acid fast smear, negative
immunofluorescent test for PCP.  [**Name10 (NameIs) **] patient responded well
to antibiotic therapy and was extubated on [**2182-3-6**].  He
was continued antibiotics for his pneumonia and was
transferred out to the medical floor the following day.
Despite his clinical improvement there was concern over the
partially loculated left sided pleural effusion that was
abutting the area of consolidation.  A thoracentesis was
performed under ultrasound guidance on [**2182-3-12**] to
ensure that this was not a peripnuemonic effusion or an
empyema.  The fluid was clear yellow and was transudative.
This was felt to be secondary to his congestive heart
failure. The patient will be discharged on an additional four
days of Levaquin therapy for his pneumonia, which will be
renally dosed at 250 mg q 48 hours.

2.  Septic pulmonary emboli:  The patient has received
greater then four weeks of appropriate antibiotic coverage
for his MSSA septic pulmonary emboli.  The patient has had
multiple CT scans of his chest, which revealed stable
appearance of the septic pulmonary emboli suggesting
successful treatment of his disease.  The patient will have a
follow up CAT scan on [**2182-3-21**] and will follow up with
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in the Department of Infectious Disease on [**2182-3-28**].

3.  Congestive heart failure:  The patient has an ejection
fraction of 20% from his ischemic cardiomyopathy.  He has had
multiple myocardial infarctions in the past as well as
coronary artery bypass graft surgery.  The patient was
slightly volume overloaded on admission and also experienced
some mild congestive heart failure during his admission,
which was likely due to volume overload during his treatment
for sepsis.  The patient's volume status was managed with
hemodialysis.  In addition, the patient's left sided pleural
effusion was drained and approximately 800 cc of clear yellow
fluid were removed.  The patient will be continued on his
beta-blocker, ace inhibitor and Digoxin.

4.  Atrial fibrillation:  The patient's prevailing rhythm
during this admission was atrial fibrillation.  The patient
reports that he is not on anticoagulation therapy, however,
he does take an aspirin a day.  The patient does not have a
primary care physician and is unsure of why he is not on
Coumadin therapy.  He states that he may have a protein S
deficiency.  He believes that may be why he is not on
anticoagulation.  The patient was continued on his beta
blocker and his Amiodarone and was given a follow up
appointment with his outpatient cardiologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on
[**2182-3-25**].  In addition, the patient will find a new
primary care physician [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] with whom he will
meet on [**2182-4-5**] at which time the issue of
anticoagulation can be addressed.

5.  Coronary artery disease:  The patient was continued on
his aspirin, beta-blocker, ace inhibitor and was started on a
statin during this admission.  The patient should have his
liver function tests checked in approximately three months
after discharge.

6.  Diabetes mel
