melena

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:

History of Present Illness:
75yo woman with history of DM2, HTN, CAD s/p CABG, diastolic
CHF with EF of 60-65%, and past GI bleeding with AVMs
on EGD and colonoscopy now presents with melena. On day of
admission, she had presented to the [**Hospital1 18**] day care unit where
she was to have teh patency of her AV fistula evaluated.  There,
it was noted that her Hct was down to 21. She was referred to
the ED. In the ED,
she had a dark bowel movement that was guaiac positive. Initial
vitals in the ED were 99.4, 81, 133/44, 28, and 95% on 2L NC; FS
166.
There, she felt well with no complaints of chest pain, shortness
of breath, abdominal pain, lightheadedness or any other
complaints.
In Emergency department, a right IJ triple lumen catheter was
placed given difficult peripheral access, she was given
albuterol/atrovent nebs x 1, protonix 40mg IV x 1, and one unit
PRBC. She refused an NG lavage.  She remained hemodynamically
stable throughout. On review, she does report that she has had
dark stools and mild diffuse abdominal pain for the past two
days.  She had no hematemesis or BRBPR.
.
In ED, she was seen by Nephrology, who recommended starting
Epogen at 10,000 units MWF, continuing lasix at 80mg daily,
transfusing only 2units PRBC given risk for volume overload, and
to perform a fistulogram when she is stable. They noted that
there is no need for urgent hemodialysis. She was also seen by
Gastroenterology, who recommended (in light of her refusal of NG
lavage and Endoscopy) serial q4h hematocrits, holding ASA,
protonix [**Hospital1 **]. Will follow.

Brief Hospital Course:
75yo woman with recurrent GI bleeding secondary to AVM who
presented with melena and Hct drop from baseline of 30's to 21.
She was hemodynamically stable on arrival.  GI was consulted,
but the patient refused NG lavage, as well as endoscopy.  She
was admitted to the MICU where she was monitored with Q4 hour
Hct.  She was transfused a total of 2units PRBC's.  Her Hct
trended from 21.7 --> 28.2 after transfusion, and stabilized in
the mid-high 20's.  Her coagulopathy was corrected and she
received DDAVP.  She was also started on Procrit.  Hematology
was consulted and recommended continued following of Hct, and
also suggested possible thalidomide or estrogen for treatment of
chronic AVM bleeding.  The medicine team was reluctant to start
estrogen given her high risk of clot formation (HIT, obesity,
etc.).  Eventually, she was given another 2 units PRBC's to
bring her Hct above 30.  Dialysis was not intitiated on this
admission.  The patient will follow up with renal as an
outpatient for initiation of dialysis.  She will also follow up
with GI as an outpatient for monitoring of her chronic GI
bleeding, and for the possibilty of thalidomide therapy vs.
estrogen.
