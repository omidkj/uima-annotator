Pertinent Results:
CARDIAC CATH [**8-4**]
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Severe left main and three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Moderate systolic left ventricular dysfunction.
COMMENTS:
1. Coronary angiography in this right dominant system
demonstrated left
main and 3 vessel disease. The LMCA had a distal 70% lesion. The
LAD
had an 80% ostial lesion with mid/distal 80% lesion. The LCx
system had an occluded OM2 with collateral filling. The RCA was
proximally occluded with left coronary collaterals.
2. Resting hemodynamics revealed normal left ventricular
systolic
pressure of 104 mm Hg and normal LVEDP of 12 mm Hg. Sytemic
arterial
systolic and diastolic pressures were normal.
3. Left ventriculography revealed no mitral regurgitation, mild
global
hypokinesis, and LVEF of 45%.

ECHO [**2179-7-29**]
Overall preserved left ventricular systolic function. Mild
mitral regurgitation. Mildly dilated ascending aorta.

ECHO [**7-14**]:
There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction
with inferior and apical hypokinesis. Right ventricular chamber
size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The
pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
There is no pericardial effusion.

EGD: [**8-19**]
Normal mucosa in the whole esophagus;  Erythema and congestion
in the stomach body and antrum compatible with mild gastritis;
Superficial ulcer -second part part of the duodenum at previous
BICAP site;  Small hiatal hernia; Otherwise normal EGD to second
part of the duodenum

EGD [**8-16**]:
Erythema and congestion in the gastroesophageal junction
compatible with mild esophagitis;  Erythema and congestion in
the antrum compatible with mild gastritis; Angioectasia in the
second part of the duodenum; Small hiatal hernia; Otherwise
normal EGD to second part of the duodenum



Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a pleasant 64-year-old male with a significant past
medical history of diabetes, hypertension, prior bladder cancer
and a hiatal hernia who had signs and symptoms of progressive
chronic mesenteric ischemia. Of note, the patient had previously
undergone an aortobifemoral bypass approximately 15 years prior
to presentation for bilateral aorto-iliac occlusive disease. He
now had a several week to month history of progressive
postprandial angina and food fear and weight loss. However, the
patient presented to the vascular service on [**2179-7-14**] with
a several day history of nausea, vomiting, abdominal distention
and obstipation. Initial workup revealed leukocytosis and a CT
scan revealing evidence of a transition point in the right lower
quadrant. Suspicion for a high grade
small bowel obstruction was noted. However, given the
constellation of findings of his prior chronic mesenteric
ischemia, it was unclear as to whether or not this was also a
potential etiology of his pain presentation.

1 Mesenteric ischemia: On the morning of [**2179-7-17**], the
patient was noted to be focally tender with a 23,000 white count
and bandemia. In lieu of his CT scan done the prior day showing
a transition point in the right lower quadrant with the physical
constellation as described, an urgent general surgery
consultation was made by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] covering for Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1391**]. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] approached Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and discussed the plan
of care. After review, it was determined that the patient
required urgent exploration. The patient was consented and risks
including bleeding, infection, bowel in discontinuity, open
abdomen, myocardial infarction, stroke and death, intracutaneous
fistula, recurrent abscesses, possible short bowel were
described.
He was taken to the OR on [**7-17**] and underwent an exploratory
laparotomy, segmental ileal resection, and mesenteric vessel
exploration.  Abdomen was left open for a planned second look
operation. The patientleft the operating room hemodynamically
stable. However, he was quite volume outed. He was not on
vasopressors at the
completion of this operation. He was left intubated in critical
condition and returned to the trauma SICU for further monitoring
and care. The vascular surgery service had performed the
catheter-based revascularization of the superior mesenteric
artery. On [**7-18**] the patient then underwent resection 8 cm distal
ileum, resection terminal ileum and right colon. Ileotransverse
colostomy and [**State 19827**] patch temporary abdominal wall closure.
On [**7-27**] patient returned to the OR for definitive abdominal
wound closure and tracheostomy.

2. Myocardial infarction: Incidentally noted to have ST
depressions on telemetry, confirmed with 12-lead in V3-V6 on
[**7-25**].  Troponin leak: TnT  baseline 0.05 on [**7-14**] noted to be
0.62=>0.51.  Also with severe pulmonary edema on CXR. Once he
became hemodynamically stable, he was agressively diuresed with
lasix/spironolactone. Patient had a repeat ECHO that showed the
left atrium to to be normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses and cavity size are normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function appeared normal (LVEF 55%). Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation was  seen. ST-T changes were though to be a result
of cardiac demand.  It was thought that patient would benefit
from a cardiac catherization to better ellucidate his disease
process and defect. On [**8-4**] he underwent a cardiac catherization
that showed a right dominant system demonstrating left main and
3 vessel disease.  The LMCA had a distal 70% lesion.  The LAD
had an 80% ostial lesion with mid and distal 80% lesions.  The
LCx system had an occluded OM2 with collateral filling.  The RCA
was
proximally occluded with left coronary collaterals. Because of
this pathology, cardiac surgery team was consu
