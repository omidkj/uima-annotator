PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vitals:  Temperature is 98.2 degrees,
heart rate 76, respiratory rate 16, and blood pressure
130/70.  General:  The patient is in no acute distress .
HEENT:  Right pupil is fixed and left is minimally
responsive.  EOMI.  Anicteric sclerae.  Moist mucous
membranes.  Tongue deviates to the right.  Right facial droop
is noted.  JVP is 6 cm.  Heart:  Regular rate and rhythm with
no murmurs.  Lungs:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. Coronary artery disease:  The patient was maintained on
   aspirin, Coreg, and Zestril.  Blood pressures were
   followed closely for ischemia.  There was no active
   evidence of ischemia.  Cardiac enzymes confirmed this.
   Echocardiogram from [**2116-4-27**], revealed an EF of 25
   percent, left atrium that is elongated, right atrium
   mildly dilated, left ventricular wall thickness that is
   normal.  Left ventricular cavity size mildly dilated.
   Overall, left ventricular systolic function severely
   depressed.  Right ventricular systolic function appears
   depressed.  Aortic root has normal diameters and the aorta
   is mildly dilated; 2 plus MR is noted.  Physiologic TR is
   noted.
2. Rhythm:  The patient was noted to have runs as
   asymptomatic ventricular tachycardia.  He was maintained
   on amiodarone GTT and lidocaine GTT.  EP was consulted and
   the patient underwent VT ablation that was unsuccessful
   secondary to aneurysm.  The patient subsequently had [**Year/Month/Day 3941**]
   that was placed on [**2116-4-29**].  The patient had a [**Company 1543**]
   max-mode DR [**Last Name (STitle) 3941**] placed via right cephalic access with no
   complications.  Otherwise, the patient was maintained on
   amiodarone 400 mg t.i.d. times 1 week, 400 mg q.d. times 3
   weeks, and then 400 mg q.d. after that point.  The patient
   was also maintained on Coumadin and Lasix with good
   effect.
3. Hypertension:  The patient was maintained on Coreg and
   Zestril for CVA.  The patient was maintained on Dilantin.
   His Dilantin dose was halved without patient's further
   management.
4. Prophylaxis:  The patient was maintained on subcutaneous
   heparin, bowel regimen, PPI, and the patient's bilateral
   knees were negative.  The patient was a full code and was
   discharged on [**2116-4-30**].


MEDICATIONS AT DISCHARGE:
1. Amiodarone 400 mg 1 tablet 3 times a day for 5 days, then
   amiodarone 400 mg 1 tablet once a day for 3 weeks, and
   then amiodarone 200 mg tablets 1 by mouth once a day.
2. The patient was maintained on Dilantin 200 mg once a day.
3. Tylenol 1 to 2 tablets q.4 hours p.r.n., as needed for
   pain, not to exceed 4 gm a day.
4. Fluticasone 110 mcg 2 puffs b.i.d.
5. Lisinopril 5 mg 1 tablet once a day.
6. Aspirin 325 mg 1 by mouth once a day.
7. Atorvastatin 20 mg 1 tablet by mouth once a day.
8. Metoprolol 12.5 mg 1 by mouth twice a day.
9. Coumadin 5 mg tablets every night.

to have his Chem-10, PT, PTT, INR, and Dilantin level
checked.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1. Ventricular tachycardia, status post ventricular
   tachycardia ablation.
2. Status post implantable cardioverter defibrillator
   placement.
3. History of cerebrovascular accident.
4. History of hypertension.
