runs the
entire length of the abdominal wall from the liver into the
pelvis. Flow in
all of the portal veins is towards this enlarged patent
umbilical vein.

1. Severe, rapidly progressing, multifocal, necrotizing
pneumonia.

n.p.o. status; ultrasound indicated if there is clinical concern

Brief Hospital Course:
31 yo M with ESLD, ETOH cirrhosis p/w LLL PNA to OSH, tx here
with septic shock, respiratory failure requiring intubation
([**2168-2-22**]), found to have strep pneumo PNA and empyema (s/p chest
tube), ARDS, pancytopenia and ARF who subsequently developed
VAP, MRSE bacteremia, and overwhelming hypotension with
hypothermia. Given his overwhelming organ failure, septic shock,
and poor long-term prognosis, taken with Mr. [**Known lastname 34858**] wishes,
his co-HCP'[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 1692**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 52348**] and [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 2808**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 52349**] decided to make
goals of care comfort measures only. He was extubated at 1730 on
[**2168-3-22**] and passed away at 1845 that same day with his family at
his bedside.

1. Respiratory Failure: Intubated since [**2168-2-22**]. Resp failure
initially strep pneumo PNA with L empyema s/p chest tube
placement ([**2168-2-23**]), decreased MS, pulmonary edema, ARDS. Stopped
vancomycin/levofloxacin on [**3-6**] (though should have been 4 wk
course given empyema). Developed recurrent VAP [**3-17**], on
vanco/zosyn, mini-BAL with only yeast. Less secretions,
afebrile. Vancomycin/Pip-Tazo ([**Date range (1) 52350**]), though will need 4 wk
course for pan-sensitive strep pneumo (could use vanco [**Date range (1) 52351**]
vs. consider switching to ctx or pcn). Diureses attempted with
Lasix 20 IV q6H (I/O goal -0.5 to -1L).

2. Bacteremia: Developed [**1-26**] blood cx [**3-17**] MRSE, [**3-18**] NG. He was
on vanco planned for 2 weeks treatment from neg. cx. He was
considered for resiting lines (try for picc, d/c right picc and
cvc), consider resite art.line

3. Hypotension: Briefly hypotensive [**3-21**], fluid responsive,
thought related to diuresis as improved with ivf and he was net
negative. However, he developed severe hypotension as described
above on [**3-22**] prompting a discussion with both HCP's and family
re goals of care and was made CMO.

4. ARF/ATN: Likely ATN, seems to be waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**]. Stopped
octreotide/midodrine since unlikely to be HRS.

5. Anemia/Pancytopenia: Secondary to bleeding in mouth (suction
trauma and coagulopathy) and through OG tube (portal gastropathy
on EGD) and underlying liver disease. Blood products were used
to reverse coagulopathy throughout his hospital course.

6. Empyema: Noted on admission with strep pneumo from pleural
fluid. He had a chest tube placed. Per thoracic [**Doctor First Name **] chest tube
placed [**2-23**] for difficulty ventilating, significant air space
loss. Initial WBC of pleural fluid >1000. This was continued
with chest tube to water seal.

7. ESLD: Secondary to alcohol use, off transplant list. Pt with
significant alcohol abuse, med non-compliance, lost to follow
up. Tylenol level was not above Rumack-[**Doctor First Name **] nomogram. Liver
service recommended supportive care and his liver continued to
fail throughout his hospital course. He was continued on
lactulose and rifaximin.

8. Ileus: Continued attempts at low dose trophic tube feeds
failed and caused bleeding. Decreasing narcotic sedation did not
help. PO naloxone, erythromcyin and reglan also did not help.

9. FEN: TF as above, TPN since [**2-29**], (no calcium, no heparin).
Hypernatremia resolved with free water repletion, will monitor.


10. PPX: Pneumoboots, PPI

11. Communication: [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 1692**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 52348**]: Partner, HCP is shared with
sister [**Name (NI) 2808**].

12. ACCESS: L fem line discontinued [**2-29**], L IJ placed [**2-29**]. R
A-line on [**2-29**], R PICC on [**3-10**]
