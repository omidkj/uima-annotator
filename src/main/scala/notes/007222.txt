Service: NEUROSURGERY

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1271**]
Chief Complaint:
" I can't move my legs"

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 931**] is a 72 yo woman who returns from [**Hospital 38**]
rehabilitation center following a change in exam from her
discharge earlier today.  To review, Ms. [**Known lastname 931**] was admitted
on [**4-28**] after sustaining an unwitnessed fall at home.  Upon
admission, the patient was found to have a frontal and
temporal subarachnoid hemorrhage and a non displaced occipital
fracture.  The patient is experiencing significant weakness in
her hands and legs upon exam.  MRI demonstrated edema within the
spinal cord at C5-C7, felt to be secondary to a hemorrhagic
contusion.  The patient's exam was reportedly slightly decreased
from admission, but overall stable.  She was discharged to rehab
this AM ([**5-3**]).  Upon arrival to rehabilitation this afternoon,
there was concern that the patient was no longer able to move
her
legs.  In addition, he was reporting pain in her arms (right
worse than left).  Given this, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 739**] (her prior
attending) was contact[**Name (NI) **] and the patient was referred back to
the
emergency room for further evaluation.

The patient currently endorces [**3-11**] pain in her right arm
(between her shoulder and her elbow).  She reports being numb in
her legs and states she has been unable to move her legs since
this morning.  She endorces a feeling of vibration moving across
her mid section which is uncomfortable but not painful  She has
not had a bowel movement in the last 24-48 hours.  She has a
foley that was in place since her transfer so she is unsure of
her urinary control.  She denies any headache, changes in
vision,
chills or nausea.  She denies difficulty breathing; she has no
chest pain.  All other ROS where negative.

Pertinent Results:
[**2113-5-3**] C-Spine CT: IMPRESSION: 1. No fracture. 2. Multilevel
degenerative changes, worse at C4-C5, C5-C6, C6-C7, with
posterior disc osteophyte complex at this level.

[**2113-5-3**] C-Spine MRI:
IMPRESSION:
1. Progression of the cord signal abnormality suggestive of
progressive
edema, now extending caudally to the T2 level. While this can
relate to
trauma, consider follow up and clinical/lab correlation to
exclude
non-traumatic causes.
2. Findings suggestive of a nondisplaced fracture involving the
T2 vertebral body. Further evaluation with CT/PXR can be
considered for better assessment of fractures.
3. Extensive abnormal STIR signal in the posterior soft tissues,
the
interspinous ligament, prevertebral fluid, and high signal along
the
ligamentum nuchae are all suggestive of traumatic injury
with/without
associated ligamentous injury. Small amount of facet joint fluid
at the C3-4 level and the T2-3 level. Correlate with CT.
4. High grade canal stenosis at the levels above.

[**2113-5-10**] Cspine MRI:
IMPRESSION:
1. Interval improvement in residual cord signal abnormality when
compared
with the prior study of [**2113-5-3**]. Subtle enhancement in the cord
can be seen
after contusion.
2. Marked interval improvement in edema and fluid within the
prevertebral
soft tissues, interspinous ligaments, and ligamentum nuchae when
compared with the prior study.
3. Please see report of MRI performed [**2113-5-3**] for evaluation of
stable severe degenerative changes of the cervical spine.

[**2113-5-13**] CTA Chest:
IMPRESSION:
1. Large bilateral pulmonary emboli with extension into multiple
subsegmental branches as described above.
2. Aberrant right subclavian artery causing mass effect on the
esophagus.

[**2113-5-13**] Head CT:
IMPRESSION:
Ill-defined focus of hyperintensity within the left frontal
lobe, not
identified on the prior study and could represent a small amount
of acute
subarachnoid hemorrhage. Hyperdense focus within the posterior
[**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the
left lateral ventricle also not identified on the prior study,
could represent a tiny amount of intraventricular blood. Given
the patient's history of recent heparinization, an MRI or serial
CT scans may be obtained for further characterization.

[**2113-5-14**] Bilateral Upper/Lower extremity veins ultrasound:
No DVTs.

[**2113-5-14**] MRI Cspine:
IMPRESSION:
Stable appearance of Cspine.

[**2113-5-14**] Head:
1. No change.
2. Hyperdense foci in the left frontal lobe and left occipital
[**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the
lateral ventricles are unchanged in size and density.




Brief Hospital Course:
Pt was seen in the emergency room and evaluated by the
neurosurgery team. She was admitted to Neurosurgery in the SICU
for q1 hour neuro checks. Her goal MAP >85 to ensure cord
perfusion (using a neosenephrine gtt as needed). She was given
Decadron 10mg IV x 1. Family was updated of current situation
and plan.
A C-spine CT and MRI were obtained. CT revealed no changes from
previous scan. MRI revealed progression of the cord signal
abnormality suggestive of contusion/edema
previously noted, now extending caudally to the T2 level and a
nondisplaced fracture involving the T2 vertebral body.

On [**5-4**] upon examination the patient had stable strengths of her
UE's, no movement of her left LE and reflexive vs extension of
her R LE to stimulation. No clonus was appreciated and patellar
reflexes were 3+ b/l. Sensation was intact to light touch. At
this time her neuro check were changed to q2hrs, but she
remained in the ICU for close neuro exams and BP control.
On [**5-5**] her neurological exam remained stable. Her SBP was
liberalized to >120 and her Neo-Synephrine gtt was weaned. She
continued on midodrine and her decadron was changed to a taper
over 5 days.
On [**5-8**] she continued to be in the ICU her neurologic exam was
improving with her right leg now with strength of at least 4 in
all muscle groups except her IP which was 2+. On [**5-9**] she was
placed on neosynephrine and she had bradycardia to the 20's. Her
LLE was moving less and her SBP goal was raised to >120. On [**5-10**]
she was continued on neosynephrine for BP control in order to
keep her SBP>120 but was unable to so her SBP goal was made
>100. Also on [**5-10**] she had an MRI of the cervical spine which
showed
