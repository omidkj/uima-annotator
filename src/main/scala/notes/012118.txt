[**2116-9-30**] CXR: There is moderate cardiomegaly. Pulmonary venous
congestion and perihilar haziness is noted indicative of
pulmonary interstitial edema. There are no pleural effusions. A
catheter is seen within the left main pulmonary artery via the
right femoral access.
.
[**2116-9-30**]: Cardiac catheterization: 1. Selective coronary
angiography in this right dominant circulation demonstrated two
vessel coronary artery disease. The LMCA was without
angiographically apparent flow limiting disease. The proximal
LAD had mild luminal irregularities. The mid LAD had a hazy 80%
discrete stenosis with slow flow. There was also a 90% stenosis
toward the apical portion of the LAD. The D1 and D2 were high
branches and small. The D3 is larger without significant
obstructive disease. The LCx had mild diffuse disease throughout
its course about the AV groove. There was a large OM1 without
significant flow limiting disease. The RCA had
moderate to severe diffuse disease with chronic total occlusion
of the
distal RCA. There were collaterals noted from the left
circulation
supplying the right side.
2. Resting hemodynamics from right heart catheterization
demonstrated
moderate pulmonary arterial hypertension (50/30 mmHg), mildly
elevated
RVEDP (15 mmHg), and severely elevated PCWP (35mmHg). The PCWP
tracing
were to have large v waves. The calculated cardiac output by the
Fick
method was 3.3 with a cardiac index of 1.5.
3. Successful PTCA/stenting of the mid LAD with a 3.5x28mm
Cypher DES
with excellent results (see PTCA comments).
.
[**10-1**] Echo: 1. The left atrium is moderately dilated.
2. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The
left ventricular cavity size is normal. There is severe global
left ventricular hypokinesis. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is severely depressed with EF <20%
3. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
4. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+)
mitral
regurgitation is seen.
.
[**10-2**] TEE in preparation for cardioversion: The left atrium is
dilated. Mild spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body
of the left atrium. No mass/thrombus is seen in the left atrium
or left atrial appendage. Left atrial appendage emptying
velocity is reduced (<20 cm/s). The right atrium is dilated. No
spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body of  the right
atrium or right atrial appendage. No mass or thrombus is seen in
the  right atrium or right atrial appendage. No atrial septal
defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. The left ventricular
cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is severely depressed. Right ventricular chamber size
and free wall motion are normal. There are complex (>4mm,
non-mobile) atheroma in the aortic arch and descending thoracic
aorta. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but
aortic stenosis is not present. Trace aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. At least
moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is no
pericardial effusion.
.
[**2116-10-5**] Renal US: The right kidney measures 10.0 cm. The left
kidney measures 11.0 cm. There is no evidence of hydronephrosis,
abnormal masses, or stones bilaterally. There is an anechoic,
simple cyst within the mid pole of left kidney, which measures
1.7 cm. A Foley catheter is identified within the bladder, which
is otherwise unremarkable.

[**2116-10-9**] ECG after cardioversion: Sinus rhythm. First degree
atrio-ventricular conduction delay. Compared to the previous
tracing the cardiac rhythm is now sinus mechanism.

Brief Hospital Course:
82 yo male with h/o CAD, Afib, CHF, ?IMI, DM2 who woke up with
burning substernal chest pain and SOB to [**Hospital 46**] Hosp. Found to
be in rapid afib, ECG with STD laterally and RBBB at rate of
120. Trop 30. Also found to be in pulmonary edema. Started on IV
NTG, IV diltiazem, IV Lasix. Transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for cath, that
showed elevated PCWP, s/p stent to LAD, and total occlusion of
RCA. Started on Nipride and NTG for afterload and preload
reduction. He was hypoxic in the MICU requiring NRB.
