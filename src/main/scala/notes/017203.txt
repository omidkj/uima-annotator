History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 48684**] is a [**Age over 90 **] y/o woman with PMH of HTN, COPD, and
dementia who presented to [**Hospital1 **] from her nursing home with
complaint of L-sided chest pain not relieved by 2 SL
nitroglycerin. Per OSH reports, the patient stated the pain
radiated to her back earlier in the day and was associated with
nonproductive cough and shortness of breath. In the BIDN ED, the
patient also complained of LLQ pain at which point a CT scan of
the abdomen was obtained which demonstrated a dilated CBD to 14
mm. Following this finding, the patient underwent RUQ ultrasound
which (by verbal report) showed a CBD at 8 mm with questionable
opacity (stone versus sludge) in the gallbladder.
.
In the evening, she was nauseous and vomited X 2. At about the
same time, she was tachycardic on the floor to the 130s and
subsquently given 20 mg IV diltiazem X 1. Labs were repeated
demonstrating WBC up to 28.7 with bandemia, elevated liver
enzymes (normal on admission), and lactate 3.6. At that time,
she was transferred to the ICU for further care with surgical
consult for presumed cholangitis. In the ICU, the patient
maintained HRs in the 90s-100s with SBPs in the 120s-140s. She
received IVF (NS at 200 cc/hour then LR 500 cc bolus and 150
cc/hour). She received IV vancomycin, flagyl, and levofloxacin
prior to transfer.
.
On arrival to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], the patient denies any abdominal pain,
nausea, or vomiting. She tells me she did have diarrhea earlier
in the evening. She denies any shortness of breath or chest
pain.

.
Blood culture [**2144-9-30**]: pending
.
CXR [**2144-9-30**]: Portable AP chest radiograph was reviewed with no
prior films available for comparison. The heart size is at the
upper limit of normal. Mediastinal contours are unremarkable.
Lungs are essentially clear.  There is no pleural effusion or
pneumothorax.
.
ERCP [**2144-9-30**]:
Findings:
Esophagus: Limited exam of the esophagus was normal
Stomach: Limited exam of the stomach was normal
Duodenum: Limited exam of the duodenum was normal
Major Papilla: There was pus discharge and sludge in the major
papilla.
Cannulation: Cannulation of the biliary duct was successful and
deep with a sphincterotome using a free-hand technique. Contrast
medium was injected resulting in complete opacification. The
procedure was not difficult.
Biliary Tree: A moderate dilation was seen at the lower third of
the common bile duct with the CBD measuring 15mm. Two round
stones ranging in size from 10mm to 12mm that were causing
partial obstruction were seen at the lower third of the common
bile duct.
.
Procedures:
1. A sphincterotomy was performed in the 12 o'clock position
using a sphincterotome over an existing guidewire.
2. Two large stones and sludge were extracted successfully using
a 12 mm balloon.
.
Impression:
1. There was pus discharge and sludge in the major papilla.
2. Cannulation of the biliary duct was successful and deep with
a sphincterotome using a free-hand technique.
3. A moderate dilation was seen at the lower third of the common
bile duct with the CBD measuring 15mm.
4. Two round stones ranging in size from 10mm to 12mm that were
causing partial obstruction were seen at the lower third of the
common bile duct.
5. A sphincterotomy was performed in the 12 o'clock position
using a sphincterotome over an existing guidewire.
6. Two large stones and sludge were extracted successfully using

.
Recommendations:
NPO overnight, then advance diet as tolerated in AM.
Continue IV antibiotics
Consider cholecystectomy
Remain on antibiotics for total of 7 days
Follow-up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 2819**]
Avoid Aspirin and aspirin like products for 7 days.


Brief Hospital Course:
[**Age over 90 **] y/o woman with HTN, COPD, dementia presente with fever,
leukocytosis, and RUQ pain in setting of elevated liver enzymes
concerning for cholangitis.
.
# RUQ pain, fever, leukocytosis: Initial concern was for
cholangitis given her dilated CBD on imaging, fever,
leukocytosis and elevated liver enzymes. She was given zosyn and
vancomycin for broad antibiotic coverage. Blood and urine
cultures sent at [**Hospital1 **] are pending; blood culture here is
also pending. She underwent an ERCP on the morning of [**2144-9-30**] and
had a sphincterotomy with two stones removed from her common
bile duct. She remained afebrile and normontensive
post-procedure. She was kept NPO and given IVF for maintenance.
She will be transferred back to [**Location (un) 74771**] ICU for further
monitoring under the care of Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 2819**].
.
# CAD/CHF: The patient has a history of CAD and is on aspirin
325mg daily at her nursing facility. Cardiac enzymes were
checked on admission and were normal. EKG from the OSH was
reviewed and showed NSR with flattening of T waves in III and
aVF. She clinically showed no signs of volume overload and her
CXR was clear. Her aspirin was held peri-procedure and should be
held for 7 days post-ERCP.
.
# HTN: Her antihypertensives (lasix and diltiazem) were held on
admission given the concern for sepsis. Her BP was monitored
closely and was stable throughout her time in the ICU. Her
antihypertensives can be restarted once her BP stabilizes and
her infection improves.
.
# Dementia: Per report, her dementia has apparently worsened
over the last 6 months. Patient was awake and oriented x2
pre-procedure. Will defer further workup to the outpatient
setting.
.
# Asthma/COPD: She was given her home dose of advair [**Hospital1 **] and
albuterol prn. CXR was negative for any infiltrate. She was on
oxygen on arrival and it was titrated down to 1L prior to
discharge.
.
# FEN: She was kept NPO here, with the plan to remain NPO
overnight post-ERCP and then advance diet as tolerated in AM.
She is being given IVF - D51/2NS at 100 cc/hour. Her electrolyes
were checked and were within normal limits.
.
# PPx: She was given heparin SC TID. No PPI was felt to be
indicated. She was given bowel meds prn.
.
# CODE: DNR/DNI per paperwork from nursing facility
.
# COMM: [**Name (NI) **] [**Known lastname 48684**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 74772**]; alternative [**Telephone/Fax (1) 74773**]
