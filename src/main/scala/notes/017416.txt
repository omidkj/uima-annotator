STUDIES:
CT Head w/o Contrast [**2162-3-27**]:
INDICATION: 68-year-old woman with dementia, hyperglycemia, and
confusion after a fall. Evaluate for hemorrhage.
COMPARISON: [**2161-12-22**].
NON-CONTRAST HEAD CT: There is no hemorrhage, edema, or mass
effect. The ventricles, sulci, and cisterns are again prominent,
in keeping with mild parenchymal atrophy. There is
periventricular white matter hypodensity, unchanged from prior
study, and consistent with the sequelae of chronic small vessel
infarcts. There is no shift of midline structures. Accounting
for small vessel ischemic change, the [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter
differentiation is preserved, without evidence for acute large
vascular territory infarction.  There are no abnormal
extra-axial fluid collections. There is no shift of normally
midline structures.
The visualized bones are unremarkable. There is no fracture
identified. Visualized paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells
are normally aerated and clear. Previously present maxillary
air-fluid levels have resolved.
IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial process. Unchanged mild
parenchymal atrophy and sequelae of chronic small vessel
infarction.
Final Attending Comment: There are increased hypodensities in
the left cerebellum which could represent age indeterminate
infarcts, recommend MRI for further evaluation. Discussed with
MICU resident.
.
CXR [**2162-3-27**]:
INDICATION: 68-year-old female with hyperglycemia.
FINDINGS: PA and lateral chest radiographs are reviewed in
comparison to
[**2162-3-25**].
The lungs remain hyperexpanded, with increased AP diameter and
flattening of the hemidiaphragms, suggesting chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease. There is interstitial thickening and
distortion in the right perihilar region, compatible with
radiation change and stable from prior studies. There is no new
consolidation, effusion, or pneumothorax. The hilar and
cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged. Visualized bones
demonstrate no acute abnormality, though there is osteopenia
with compression deformities of multiple mid thoracic vertebral
bodies.
.
TTE [**2162-3-29**]:
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are
normal (LVEF >55%). Doppler parameters are indeterminate for
left ventricular diastolic function. Right ventricular chamber
size and free wall motion are normal. The diameters of aorta at
the sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic
valve leaflets are mildly thickened (?#). There is a minimally
increased gradient consistent with minimal aortic valve
stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. There is moderate thickening of the mitral valve
chordae. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic
shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may be
significantly UNDERestimated.] There is no pericardial effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2160-7-28**], the
velocity across the aortic valve has increased slightly. There
is no pericardial effusion seen on the current study.
.
MRA brain and neck ([**3-29**]): 1. Chronic infarctions in the left
superior cerebellar vermis and left cerebellar hemisphere, which
are new since [**2161-12-22**]. Also, unchanged chronic infarctions in
the right internal capsule, bilateral pons, and left cerebellar
peduncle since [**2160-10-26**]. No acute infarction.
2. No evidence of intracranial metastatic disease.
3. High-grade, 90-99% stenosis at the origin of the left
internal carotid artery. Approximately 60%, moderate stenosis at
the origin of the right internal carotid artery. Correlation
with carotid son[**Name (NI) 867**] would be helpful to assess the
hemodynamic significance of these stenoses.
4. The left subclavian artery and the origins
