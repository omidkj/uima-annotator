Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 68490**] was a same day admit and on [**6-25**] was brought to the
operating room where he underwent a minimal invasive off-pump
coronary artery bypass graft x 1. Please see operative report
for details. Following surgery he was transferred to the CSRU
for invasive monitoring in stable condition. Within 24 hours he
was weaned from sedation, awoke neurologically intact and
extubated. On post-op day one beta blockers and diuretics were
started and he was gently diuresed towards his pre-op weight. On
post-op day two he was transferred to the SDU for further care.
Initial chest x-ray during post-op period revealed a small
apical pneumothorax. Despite chest tubes remaining in place,
pneumothorax was still evident through post-op day four.
Therefore chest tubes were removed on post-op day four. Post
chest x-ray still revealed pneumothorax but with no increase in
size. He remained stable during these days while receiving
physical therapy for strength and mobility. On post-op day 5 he
was doing well and was discharged home with VNA services and the
appropriate follow-up appointments.
