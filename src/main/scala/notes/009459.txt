Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 8961**]
Chief Complaint:
Hypoxia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Endotracheal intubation

History of Present Illness:
78 year-old man with a history of lung adenocarcinoma s/p LUL
lobectomy, DVT, afib on Coumadin, GI bleed, and nonverbal at
baseline from severe dementia who is coming in from a nursing
home with worsened altered mental status, fever, and hypoxic
respiratory distress. He was recently admitted from [**Date range (1) 29475**]/11
for lethargy and fever. He was initially started on Vancomycin
and Zosyn due to concern for sacral decubitus ulcer infection
and possible osteomyelitis v. pneumonia. However, the CXR was
without clear new infiltrate. The tachypnea was attributed to
aspiration pneumonitis v. fever/stress response with the
infected sacral ulcer thought to be the primary infectious
process. The IV antibiotics were discontinued after 2 days as he
underwent surgical debridement, which was felt to be the
definitive treatment. He also was found to have C. diff colitis
and started on oral flagyl. His mental status improved overall,
and he was discharged back to his nursing home.
.
However, over the past day, he has had worsening altered mental
status and shortness of breath. This evening at 7pm, he was
found to have O2sats in the 70s on RA and was febrile to 101. He
was still hypoxic when EMS arrived. They placed him on CPAP with
improvement to the high 90s and brought him to the ED.
.
On ED arrival, initially vs were: T 99.1, P 88, BP 112/72, RR
32, O2sat 82% on NRB. He was tachypneic and minimally responsive
on arrival so was intubated and sedated with fentanyl and
midazolam. In the peri-intubation setting, he went into rapid
afib with mild V4-V6 ST depressions captured on EKG; the RVR
resolved with IV fluids. Labs were notable for a WBC 21 up from
12 on discharge (diff...). BNP was 1293 c/w prior admission
during which he was not felt to be in CHF. CK was 115 but trop
mildly elevated at 0.09, consistent with prior admission
(0.08-1). Post-intubation CXR showed LLL infiltrates which were
difficult to assess given his post-lobectomy changes. CTA chest
showed no PE and bibasilar infiltrates mostly at the periphery
consistent with pneumonia, less likely aspiration pneumonitis.
Blood cultures were drawn, and patient started on vancomycin and
Zosyn. During his ED course, he received a total of 3L IVF with
SBPs ranging from 79 to low 100s. He remained afebrile. On
transfer to the MICU, vs were: P 75, BP 105/66, O2sat 100% with
ABG 7.60/27/130/27 on AC 500/16/5/100%.
.
On the floor, pt appeared comfortable, intubated and sedated.

Imaging:
========
CXR:
1. Endotracheal tube in standard position.
2. Left basilar opacity may representing a combination of
pleural effusion and adjacent atelectasis, though infection is
not excluded.
3. Minima patchy opacity in the right lung base could reflect
additional area of infection.
.
CTA chest:
1. No pulmonary embolus.
2. Post-surgical changes of left upper lobectomy.
3. Diffuse peribronchovascular ground-glass nodular opacities
compatible with and infectious process. Right sided
pleural-based nodules and 5-mm nodule in the left lower lobe are
likely part and parcel with the infectious process. Attention is
recommended to these nodules on followup.
4. A 1-cm lymph node in the prevascular space is likely
reactive.
.
CXR:
As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has received
a nasogastric tube. The course of the tube is unremarkable. The
tip of the tube projects over the middle parts of the stomach.
No evidence of complications. Tip of the endotracheal tube is
visible in unchanged location. Unchanged elevation of the left
hemidiaphragm with left basal parenchymal opacity.
.


Brief Hospital Course:
78 year-old man with a history of lung adenocarcinoma s/p LUL
lobectomy, DVT, afib on Coumadin, GI bleed, chronic stage IV
sacral decubitus ulcer s/p diverting colostomy and surgical
debridement, and mostly nonverbal at baseline from severe
dementia who presents with worsened mental status, fever, and
hypoxic respiratory distress.
.
# Goals of care: During his stay in the ICU, a family meeting
was held and code status was changed to DNR/DN-reintubate. They
did not wish for escalation of care. The patient was extubated
on [**6-15**] with understanding that he may decompensate quickly or
over several days/weeks and that readmission to the ICU or
hospital is not consist
