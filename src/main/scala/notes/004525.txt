History of Present Illness:
56 year old woman with history of Sjoren's and DM who presents
with nausea and left flack pain for 6 days duration. Patient
reports dysuria, increased urinary frequency and was concerned
she "had a bladder infection". Left flack pain is similiar to
prior urinary tract infections. She denies fever, chills or
vomiting.

In the ED, initial vs were: T 99 P 66 BP 95/60 R 14 O2 sat 91%
RA. Patient given Ceftriaxone and Morphine for presumed
pyelonephritis. Patient was placed on 4 L oxygen for sat 94-96%.
Patient became increasingly somnelent and ABG demonstrated
hypercarbia. Consequently she was admitted to MICU for possible
BiPap.

Past Medical History:
*Sjogren's/sarcoid overlap syndrome, followed by Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 6426**](Rheumatology) and Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 4702**] (Immuno-Ophtho in
[**Hospital1 8**]). Recent manifestations are mostly articular. She has
failed to respond to many anti-rheumatic drugs in the past
including hydroxychloroquine, methotrexate, azathioprine,
prednisone, penicillamine, leflunomide, daclizumab (IL-2
receptor antagonist). She has also been on TNF blockers
including etanercept and infliximab. In [**2107**], she had a trial of
mycophenolate without improvement. Rheumatology team now plans
to initiate abatacept (Orencia) to address new reactivation of
chronic uveitis which manifested with eye pain. On chronic
steroids.

STUDIES:
EKG ON ADMISSION ([**2112-4-10**]):
Sinus bradycardia. Low T wave amplitude is non-specific.
Otherwise, unstable baseline makes assessment difficult. Since
the previous tracing of [**2111-3-18**] sinus bradycardia is now present.
Otherwise, there may be no significant change.
.
ECHOCARDIOGRAM ([**2112-4-12**]):
The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal defect or
patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline
contrast with maneuvers. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity
size and regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF
>55%). There is no ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The diameters of
aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
.
CT SCAN OF THE CHEST, ABDOMEN, AND PELVIS ([**2112-4-10**]).
CHEST: A right chest wall Port-A-Cath is seen with right IJ
course and
extension into the cavoatrial junction. There is mild
atherosclerotic
calcification along the aortic arch and minimal along the
coronary arteries. A small nodule is seen within the right
thyroid gland measuring approximately 7 mm in diameter. This
finding appears stable from prior. The mediastinal great vessels
appear normal in course and caliber without evidence of aneurysm
or dissection. There is an aortic origin of the left vertebral
artery, a normal variant. The pulmonary arterial tree opacifies
normally and there is no evidence of a central filling defect
through the level of the segmental branches. There is no
mediastinal lymphadenopathy. There is no pericardial effusion.
.
There is bilateral lower lobe posterior consolidation most
compatible with
dependent atelectasis. No worrisome pulmonary nodules or masses
are seen.
There is mild apically predominant emphysema.
.
ABDOMEN: Evaluation of the solid organs is somewhat limited
given the
arterial phase of imaging. The liver and spleen appear grossly
unremarkable. The gallbladder is only partially distended but
appears normal. The adrenal glands are normal in size and
configuration bilaterally. The pancreas is somewhat atrophic,
though there is no focal lesion or evidence of ductal dilation.
The kidneys enhance symmetrically without focal lesions seen.
There is atherosclerotic disease along the abdominal aorta with
mild resultant narrowing along the infrarenal segment and
chronic occlusion of the left common iliac branch as evidenced
on prior studies. There is reconstitution of blood flow in the
left external iliac branch as well as branches of the left
interna
