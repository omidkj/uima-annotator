History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 50155**] is a very pleasant 75 year old man with past medical
history significant for MDS-RAEB2 with AML features, wegener's
granulomatosis (in remission), CKD stage V on HD. He has
recently been on Revlimid therapy but stopped recently due to
rash, fatigue, and thrombocytopenia. He presented to outpatient

IMPRESSION:

1. Multiple pulmonary consolidations as described, most of them
are either new or significantly increased since [**2122-3-18**].
Similar, but smaller areas of consolidation have been seen back
in [**2115-9-22**]. The differential diagnosis would include
recurrence of known Wegener vasculitis, in particular given the
presence of areas of ground-glass surrounding the areas of
consolidation that might be consistent with hemorrhage. The
septal thickening surrounding the areas of consolidation might
be consistent with clearance of the hemorrhage by the lymphatic
system and lymphatic engourgment.
The other consideration would include opportunistic infection
such as invasive aspergillosis given the known immunosuppressed
status of the patient.
2. Splenomegaly, unchanged. Vascular calcifications. Partially
imaged
horseshoe kidney.
3. Extensive degenerative changes of the thoracic spine.
Asymmetric
sclerosis within the medial head of the left clavicle most
likely consistent with degenerative disease or arthritis or
SAPHO.
4. Dilated pulmonary arteries, consistent with pulmonary
hypertension, unchanged since [**2122-3-18**], and slightly
progressed since [**2115-9-22**] (4.5 cm).
5. Upper chest/lower neck calcifications, 5:19, most likely
representing prior surgery and given the known parathyroid
adenoma most likely related to that reason.

[**2122-6-6**] CT Chest
1. Progression of dominant expansile consolidative opacity since
the prior CT in the left upper lobe with some residual areas
that remain partly aerated, evolving substantially over two
weeks, referring to radiographs. Major differential
considerations include an expansile consolidation associated
with pyogenic infection or hemorrhage. Given immunosuppresion,
atypical sources of infection including fungal etiologies could
also be considered. The density is intermediate, so while
hemorrhage may represent a substantial component, specific areas
of hematoma are not definable.

2. Progression of left upper lobe opacity noted in the
background of
resolving mass-like opacities in the right lung and left lower
lobe.

2. New interval moderate pericardial effusion.

3. Moderate stable cardiomegaly.

4. Enlarged pulmonary artery consistent with pulmonary
hypertension.

Brief Hospital Course:
Course on the Onc Floor:
Mr [**Known lastname 50155**] was on [**2122-5-27**] admitted patient with history of
Wegener's granulomatosis, MDS/AML, recently on Revlimid therapy,
pancytopenia, and poor functional status, presented on  with
malaise, fever, and acute on chronic changes to his chest CT
with increased size and number of areas of consolidation. Given
complex history, the differential was broad, and included
regular and opportunistic infections, recurrent vasculititis,
malignancy, and/or hemorrhage. The case was discussed his
oncologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 6944**], who has also been in contact with his
pulmonologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2168**]. The plan was to begin broad
spectrum antibiotic coverage and to check blood, sputum, and
urine cultures. His hemodialysis was continued M, W, F. On
[**2122-6-4**] pt developed increasing respiratory distress, progressive
CXR consolidation and had continued hemoptysis.

ICU Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 50155**] was admitted to the [**Hospital Ward Name 332**] ICU on [**2122-6-4**] for
worsening respiratory status and increased oxygen requirements.
At admission, patient had been desaturating on low flow NC to
mid 80s at times. He was placed on shovel mask and then 70% FM
today with sats recovering to high 90s. Etiology was thought to
be worse underlying infectious process in lungs with some
additional edema as CXR showed worse LUL infiltrate and
effusions. Pt was started on broad spectrum antibiotics with
vanco, cefepime (later changed to zosyn), voriconazole, and
levaquin.

For his stage IV CKD secondary to WG pt was continued MWF
hemodialysis. He was making very small amounts of urine at
baseline

# MDS:  Pt was transfusion dependent with ongoing
thrombocytopenias and severe anemia. He has known AML
transformation with last bone marrow just few mont
