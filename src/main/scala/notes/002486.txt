Service: NEUROSURGERY

Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2724**]
Chief Complaint:
thoracic tumor

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
T8-12 Lami for tumor and Fusion T8-L2


History of Present Illness:
Pt is a pleasant 35-year-old gentleman who had developed lower
back pain.  An MRI was obtained, which demonstrated a spinal and
paraspinal mass.
This is worked up with a biopsy, which was diagnostic for a
low-grade spindle cell tumor.  He continues to be
asymptomatic,in particular, he
denies any difficulty with bowel, bladder, or gait.  His back
pain is mild.


Past Medical History:
His past medical history is significant for asthma and cluster
headaches.


Social History:
He does not smoke.  He continues to work.

Family History:
NC

Physical Exam:
On examination, his motor strength is [**3-31**] in the upper and lower
extremities.  His sensory examination was intact with respect to
the modality of light touch.  His reflexes were normal and
symmetric.  There was no point tenderness in the thoracolumbar
spine.  There was no clonus and toes were downgoing bilaterally.


Pertinent Results:
An MRI of the thoracic spine obtained on [**2135-12-26**] was
available for review.  It demonstrates a left-sided paraspinal
mass that proceeds from roughly T8-L1.  It seems to originate
from paraspinal location and expands to neuroforamina at T9-10,
T10-11, T11-12, and T12-L1.  There is significant extension
within the spinal canal, which displaces the spinal cord from
left to right.  The majority of the mass is in the paraspinal
region.  The bone appears to be scalloped rather than invaded.

Brief Hospital Course:
Pt was admitted electively to the hospital and brought to the OR
where under general anesthesia a thoracic laminectomy, excision
of paraspinal mass, thoracic instrumented fusion and iliac crest
bone graft was performed. He tolerated this procedure well and
post-op was transferred intubabted to the SICU. His motor and
sensation post op were intact.  Pt developed anemia
post-operatively and was transfused 2 units of autologus blood.
Post transfusion hct remained at 26. he was extubated on first
post op morning.  He was begun on PCA.  Drainage from 2 drains
placed intra-op was monitored.  His activity and diet were
advanced. he was transferred to the floor. While on the floor,
patient had both drains removed. A PT consult was obtained and
patient began transferring and ambulating with assisstance. Pt
was started on a bowel regimen and pain medications were changed
to provide improved relief.
On post op day #5 the pt's temperature was elevated to 102.7.
CXR and UA were negative. LFT's were not elevated and he did not
have any signs or symptoms of PE (no calf tenderness or cord
noted on exam).  Blood cultures were sent and the results no
growth .
His incision remains clean and dry without erythema.  He has
been ambulating quite frequently as well as utilizing his
incentive spirometry.
Chest/abdomen/pelvis CT done [**2136-5-10**] showed: 1. Status post
thoracotomy at T8 through T10 with laminectomy extending from T9
through L1 and posterior fusion of T8 through L2. There is a
collection of fluid and gas within the left paraspinal region
extending from T8 through T12 as described above, which may
represent post-surgical changes; however, infection cannot be
excluded 2. Bilateral symmetric ill-defined low density
involving the subscapularis muscles bilaterally, new since prior
exam. Differentail includes muscular edema from positioning
during surgery vs synovial fluid. 3. Layering left pleural
effusion and adjacent compressive atelectasis.
4. Sigmoid diverticulosis without evidence of diverticulitis.
IV Vancomycin 1g IV BID is started on [**2136-5-11**] for a 10-day
course. The patient has remained afebrile for > 24 hours. His
staples and drain sutures were removed [**2136-5-12**]. He is ambulating
well, taking in food PO, and his pain is under control.
Arrangements have been made for him to receive his vanco at the
ER at [**Hospital 71976**] [**Hospital 107**] Hospital [**Telephone/Fax (1) 71977**].
