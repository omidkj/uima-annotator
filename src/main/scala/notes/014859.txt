Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 20506**]
Chief Complaint:
[**Last Name (un) **] back pain, concern for spinal infection

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Spinal fusion


History of Present Illness:
58 year-old right-handed woman with h/o DM, peripheral
neuropathy and lumbosacral radiculopathy presents with low back
and leg pain with MRI findings concerning for spinal infection.
The patient's current illness began in [**Month (only) 958**], when she was
admitted to OSH for PNA and UTI. She had deconditioning and legs
were weak, requiring admission to rehab at [**Hospital1 **]. She was
suffering from severe low back pain, worse than ever before. She
was seen at [**Hospital1 112**] in [**Month (only) 547**] and she was found to have L2 fracture
concerning for pathologic fracture thus she underwent biopsy
which showed reactive cells and no suggestion of malignancy.
She had a lot of pain from this procedure itself, and the pain
did not improve afterwards.

She went back to [**Hospital3 **] and was doing daily physical
therapy, ambulating with a walker. When seen in neuromuscular
clinic [**5-31**], she continued to have severe back pain radiating
down the right leg superimposed on tingling/burning pain of both
feet prior to the acute/subacute L2 fracture found in [**Month (only) 547**].
[**Month (only) **]. [**First Name (STitle) **] and [**Name5 (PTitle) 557**] repeated an MRI of the L spine
and there was concern for infectious process. In addition, ESR
and CRP were elevated, so admission was recommeneded for
consideration of IV antibiotics.
The pt c/o pain at the R low back and hip that radiates both
across to the L low back/hip and down both legs posteriorly to
the toes. The pain in sharp and can be worsened by bending down
(ie to put on shoes) or lying flat. Pain medications, such as
Vicodin, have helped, but the lowest pain scale is [**6-19**] even
with meds.

Discharge Physical Exam:
General exam as above.
Neuro exam: mental status and CNs are all grossly normal.
Strength testing is generally full strength in the upper
extremities. She is at least [**4-14**] in the lower extremity with 5/5
distally. More proximal muscle testing is unreliable secondary
to the patient's pain.
Gait testing is deferred as the patient is on bed rest.

Brain MRI ([**6-16**]): FINDINGS:  There is no acute intracranial
hemorrhage, infarction, edema, mass, or mass effect seen.  There
is no hydrocephalus or midline shift.  Major intracranial flow
voids are preserved.  There are multiple T2/FLAIR
hyperintensities in bilateral periventricular white matter and
pons. Visualized orbits, paranasal sinuses, and mastoid air
cells are unremarkable. There is mucosal thickening in the right
sphenoid sinus.  Post-contrast scans are limited by motion
artifact.

IMPRESSION:
1. Limited MRI study. Post contrast images are degraded by
motion artefact. NO acute intracranial abnormality.
2. T2/FLAIR hyperintensity seen in pons likely due to small
vessel disease. Although this may be seen with central pontine
myelinolysis, pattern of signal changes favour small vessel
ischemic disease. Clinical correlation recommended.

MRI L-spine ([**6-7**]): FINDINGS:  There is a compression fracture
at L2 and T12.  There appears to be some further height loss
anteriorly at L2 compared to the prior examination. There is
increased signal within the intervening disc space at L1-L2.
Following gadolinium administration, there is enhancement of the
L2 vertebral body as well as the endplates of L1.  There is
apparent enhancement in the pre- and para-vertebral soft tissues
at T12-L1 and L1-L2 extending into the foramina.  There is also
enhancement within the thecal sac at L1-L2 likely involving the
nerve roots of the cauda equina.  There is moderate canal
stenosis at this level.  A component of epidural enhancement at
L1-L2 cannot be entirely excluded in view of the degree of canal
stenosis at this level.

There is scoliosis of the lumbar spine to the left.

Multilevel lumbar DJD is stable including significant foraminal
narrowing at L5/S1 b
