Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4891**]
Chief Complaint:
Right sided chest pain


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Thoracentesis


History of Present Illness:
This is a 37 year-old Polish-speaking man with a history of
Stage 1 papillary RCC s/p right partial nephrectomy who presents
with right-sided chest pain for one day. There was sudden onset
of right-sided chest pain radiating to his right scapula at 4am
which woke him up from sleep. No radiation to his back. This
pain was exacerbated by deep breaths and movement though present
at rest. He has also had nightly fevers to 38C for past [**3-26**]
days. No cough, sore throat, diarrhea, abd pain, loss of
appetite, malaise, or other illnesses. No recent trauma. No h/o
radiation. No lower extremity edema or pain, history of clots,
nor recent long trips. He has never had a similar episodes in
the past. No recent travel outside of country or medication
changes (started Chantix 7 weeks ago), no sick contacts. Denies
dysuria or hematuria, or changes in bowel. Does have some mild
headaches for past week with no vision changes. He has been
taking 1600mg of ibuprofen daily for past 4-5 days for fever and
"anti-inflammatory effect". No skin rashes other than dry skin
at left ankle which was itching and now resolved.
.
In the ED, initial vs were: T 98.8, P 79, BP 149/82, RR 18,
O2sat 98%, pain [**6-30**]. His exam was unremarkable other than for
possible mild tenderness on palpation of chest. Labs with WBC
12.1 with 75.6 neutrophils. LFTs, lipase, lactate, and CE nl...
EKG showed NSR at 73 bpm with LAD. His CXR showed widened
mediastinum and low lung volumes consistent with splinting. As
he was about to be taken down for a CTA torso, he suddenly
developed severe chest pain, became diaphoretic, and appeared
pale. No headaches. His SBP was 180 on the right and 165 on the
left. He was taken urgently to the CT scanner; the study showed
no dissection nor PE. It was notable only for lipomatosis of the
mediastinum and pathologically enlarged hilar LN. However, while
in the CT scanner, he continued to splint with resultant O2
desaturations to the 80s. He was placed on a NRB with
improvement in his O2sat to 100%. He was given morphine 4mg IV,
then dilaudid 4mg IV for pain control. He was reevaluated with
no change in history, but rectal temp was found to be 102, and
he was given Tylenol. He also received vancomycin and zosyn for
broad coverage of an unclear infection; U/A unremarkable. Given
concern that he would trigger on the floor, he was admitted to
the ICU. On transfer, vs were:
.
On the floor, patient reported feeling more comfortable. He
continued to have R sided chest pain and RUQ pain at rest and
worse with inspiration and turning. He also reported dizziness
with sitting up which resolved with lying down, no changes in BP
during episode. Reports that SOB is due to pain.
.
Review of systems:

Chest PA/Lateral:
IMPRESSION: A dramatic change in the appearance of the
mediastinum and
cardiac silhouette, likely accentuated by the profoundly low
lung volumes, however, the accompanying pleural effusions and
basilar atelectasis again further complicate the evaluation.
Given the apparent symptoms, cross-sectional imaging is advised.


CT Chest/Abdomen/Pelvis:
IMPRESSION:
1. No pulmonary embolism or aortic pathology identified. Widened
mediastinum on chest x-ray secondary to lipomatosis of the
mediastinum.
2. Pathologically enlarged lymph nodes throughout the
mediastinum and hilum, though fatty hilum of lymph nodes and
normal morphology is maintained. This is suggestive of a
reactive lymphadenopathy.
3. Low lung volumes bilaterally with associated atelectasis and
a small right pleural effusion.
4. No abdominal pathology identified.
5. Expected partial nephrectomy postoperative appearance.
.
CXR ([**2126-5-6**]):
IMPRESSION:
1. Reaccumulation of moderate right pleural effusion.
2. Bibasilar atelectases is unchanged from prior study.

CT chest ([**2126-5-5**]):
IMPRESSION: Right lower lobe pneumonia with small associated
pleural
effusion.
.
CXR ([**2126-5-4**], Preliminary):
No PTX, pleural effusion at right base tracking into the minor
fissure, bilater
