Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 800**]
Chief Complaint:
Pleurisy

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 56 yo M with a history of hemachromatosis c/b
CVA [**96**] year ago with no residual deficits, who presented to the
ED today complaining of several days of left sided chest pain
that is worse with inspiration. The pain is sharp and
nonradiating and is worse with sitting up. It's constant. He
also complains of shortness of breath, but he feels this is
because it was very painful to breath at all. He has a cough
productive of brown sputum. He admitted to vomiting earlier in
the week. He has had decreased appetite and poor PO intake for
the last 2 days.  He denies f/c, n/d, diaphoresis, palpitations.

.
In the ED, the patient's VS were 97.3, 101, 130/83 satting 95%6L
nc. He underwent CTA to r/o PE, which was negative, but showed a
dense LLL pna. His labs were notable for a leukocytosis to
14,000 with 22 bands, a creatinine of 1.7, and a lactate of 3.5.
He was given 3L NS and a dose of levofloxacin 750mg x 1. He also
received morphine, toradol and dilaudid for pain control.
Lactate improved to 2.5 with IVF. Cardiac enzymes were negative
and EKG was without ischemic changes.
.
On the floor, the patient's pain was much better controlled. He
denied shortness of breath, fevers/chills. He noted that as long
as his pain was controlled, his breathing felt comfortable. He
felt very thirsty.  Shortly after arrival to the floor the
patient triggered for tachycardia to 150 while attempting to
give a sputum sample.  Telemetry monitoring showed a narrow
complex tachycardia with p waves present that lasted for about 6
minutes.  His tachycardia broke with a valsalva maneuver and his
heart rate returned to the 90s.  He was transfered to the ICU
for closer monitoring.

Studies:
[**2188-10-11**] EKG: Sinus tachycardia. Early repolarization changes.
Otherwise, findings are within normal limits. Compared to the
previous tracing of [**2171-3-14**] sinus tachycardia is new.

[**2188-10-11**] CXR - CONCLUSION: Dense pneumonic consolidation in the
left lower lobe. Please ensure followup to clearance.

[**2188-10-11**] CTA chest - CONCLUSION:
1. Dense pneumonic consolidation involving most of the left
lower lobe,
please ensure followup to clearance.
2. Up to 4 mm scattered pulmonary nodules in the right lower
lobe should be followed up with a chest CT in six months if the
patient is at high risk of cancer. Otherwise, followup is
recommended with a chest CT in 12 months.
3. Contour deformities in the liver and splenic enlargement
consistent with cirrhosis.

[**2188-10-12**] RUQ ultrasound - IMPRESSION:
1. Cirrhosis.
2. Normal Doppler evaluation of the hepatic vessels.

[**2188-10-13**] TTE - The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 55%). The
estimated cardiac index is normal (>=2.5L/min/m2). Tissue
Doppler imaging suggests a normal left ventricular filling
pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size and free
wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened (left coronary leaflet) but aortic stenosis is not
present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse. The estimated pulmonary
artery systolic pressure is normal. There is no pericardial
effusion.

Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable
for review) of [**2184-6-21**], the findings are similar.
If the clinical suspicion for iron deposition in the heart is
moderate or high, a cardiac MRI ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 9559**]) is suggested to
assess T2*.

[**10-14**] EGD
Findings: Esophagus:
 Mucosa: Streaky continuous erythema of the mucosa with no
bleeding was noted in the gastroesophageal junction. These
findings are compatible with esophagitis. A cold forceps biopsy
was performed for histology at the gastro-esophageal junction.
 Protruding Lesions 4 cords of grade I varices were seen in the
lower third of the esophagus and middle third of the esophagus.

Stomach:
 Mucosa: Erythema of the mucosa was noted in the antrum. These
findings are compatible with gastritis. Two cold forceps
biopsies were performed for histology at the stomach antrum.
Duodenum:
 Mucosa: Erythema of the mucosa was noted in the duodenal bulb
compatible with duodenitis.
Impression: Erythema in the gastroesophageal junction compatible
with esophagitis (biopsy)
Varices at the lower third of the esophagus and middle third of
the esophagus
Erythema in the antrum compatible with gastritis (biopsy)
Erythema in the duodenal bulb compatible with duodenitis
Otherwise normal EGD to second part of the duodenum
Recommendations: Avoid all NSAIDS and [**Doctor Last Name **]-2 inhibitors. Take
tylenol for pain (max dose of 2 grams per day). Nadolol 20 mg po
daily. Protonix 40 mg po daily.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 56 year old male with a history of
hemochromatosis and CAP, who presents with LLL pneumonia and
hypoxia.

# Sepsis from LLL pneumonia - The patient was admitted with an
elevated lactate, hypothermia, leukocytosis with marked
bandemia, acute renal failure, hypoxia, and  CT findings
consistent with LLL pneumonia.  Given his clinical picture, he
was initially double-covered with levofloxacin and ceftraxone.
Ceftriaxone was discontinued on [**10-13**] given his marked clinical
improvement.  A sputum sample was obtained on admission,
however, it was not a satisfactory specimen for analysis.  The
patient was given dilaudid for
