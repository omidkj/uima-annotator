Renal ultrasound [**12-19**]:
IMPRESSION: No hydronephrosis.

IMPRESSION: Torturous slightly dilated loops of large bowel with
no small bowel dilatation identified. Findings are suggestive of
postoperative ileus and continued radiographic surveillance is
recommended.

Echo [**12-19**]:
Conclusions:
1. The left atrium is mildly dilated. The left atrium is
elongated. The right
atrium is moderately dilated.
2. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity
size is normal. Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal.
Overall left
ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). [Intrinsic
left
ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the
severity of
valvular regurgitation.]
3. Right ventricular chamber size is normal. Right ventricular
systolic
function is normal.
4.The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+)
aortic
regurgitation is seen.
5.The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Severe (4+)
mitral
regurgitation is seen.
6.Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
7.There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
8.There is no pericardial effusion.

Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed)
of [**2131-7-18**],
the MR appears even more severe (previous assessment of severity
of MR
underestimated- was moderately severe (3+)).

Chest X-Ray [**12-21**]:
COMPARISON: [**2131-12-20**].

CHEST AP: A left subclavian line terminates in the distal SVC.
The NG tube has been removed. Mild cardiomegaly stable.
Bilateral layering pleural effusions are unchanged. There is
mild bibasilar atelectasis.

Chest X-ray [**12-25**]:
IMPRESSION: Slight increase of bilateral pleural effusions,
right greater than left side.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 1846**] was admitted to the surgical service for
definitive treatment of her recurrent rectal prolapse, upon
admission she was found to have urinary retention of 2L, a foley
catheter was placed without difficulty. She underwent a
rectopexy with colostomy placement without complication.
Post-operatively she was hypovolemic with periods of anuria and
hypotension, she received intravenous hydration and bolussing.
On POD 2, she was transferred to an intensive care unit, a renal
consult was placed, a central venous line was placed; a renal
ultrasound was negative for hydronephrosis; she was found to
have pre-renal failure secondary to hypotension and
administration of NSAIDs, her creatinine was elevated to 1.7
from 0.4 on admission. Cardiac enzymes and EKG were without
ischemia, EKG demonstrated atrial fibrillation consistent with
her past medical history. She was treated with intravenous
diuresis with a good response in her urine output, her
creatinine slowly normalized. An echocardiogram demonstrated
severe mitral regurgitation secondary to fluid overload,
diuresis was initiated with improvement in her oxygenation and
pulmonary assessment. On POD 6, she was transferred back to an
in-patient nursing unit, she was tolerating a regular diet, her
ostomy was functioning well, her creatinine was stable at 0.9,
her pain was well controlled with Tylenol, and her oral
beta-blockade continued. On POD 9, oral anticoagulation was
resumed for her past history of atrial fibrillation, intravenous
diuresis continued for treatment of bilateral pleural effusions
seen on x-ray and increased shortness of breath without
desaturation. On POD 10, her x-ray showed improvement along with
her physical exam, she was to continue five additional days of
oral Lasix therapy. She was discharged to [**Hospital3 **]
facility in stable condition on [**12-27**]. She was to follow-up with
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in [**11-27**] weeks, and her PCP upon discharge from
rehab.
