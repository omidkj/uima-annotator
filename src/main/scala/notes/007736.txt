HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  A 73 year old female with
diastolic dysfunction, chronic prednisone for rheumatoid
arthritis, who presents with four weeks of loose, watery
diarrhea.  She was found to be febrile to 100.5 and was also
found to be confused and lethargic at home by family members.
She was then brought to the ED, where initial evaluation
reveals a temperature of 100.1 and hypotension with systolic
blood pressure in the 60s.  She received 5 liters of IV fluid
which improved the blood pressure to the 90s.  Subsequent to
this the patient desaturated to 89 percent on room air and
was placed on 100 percent non-rebreather, which improved
saturation to 98 percent.  Initial laboratory results
revealed a lactate of 4, white blood cell count of 22.  She
was, therefore, enrolled in the sepsis protocol.  She had a
central line placed and aggressive IV hydration was
initiated.  The patient was then transferred to the Medical
Intensive Care Unit.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Lupus.
2. A-fib.
3. Anemia.
4. Osteoporosis.
5. Diastolic CHF.
6. Rheumatoid arthritis.


MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Coumadin 5, prednisone 10,
fentanyl, Lasix 40, Toprol-XL 25.

ALLERGIES:  Aspirin, Valium, Demerol, penicillin, codeine,
Percocet and Percodan.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Noncontributory.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  She lives with her husband.  She had distant
tobacco smoking.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  100.6, 86/53, pulse 76, 99 percent on
non-rebreather.  General, lying flat.  Neck, no JVD.  No
lymphadenopathy.  Lung exam there are crackles one third of
the way up bilaterally.  Cardiovascular exam irregularly
irregular.  No murmurs appreciated.  Abdomen is soft and
nontender, nondistended, normoactive bowel sounds.
Extremities reveal chronic venous stasis changes.

Pertinent laboratories reveal a white count of 24 with 5
bands. Lactate of 4.  Initial chest x-ray revealed
cardiomegaly, but otherwise normal.

BRIEF HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. Sepsis.  The patient enrolled in the MUST protocol.  She
   received empiric antibiotic therapy, as well as stress
   dose steroids.  The eventual source of infection was found
   out to be C.difficile colitis.  She received p.o. Flagyl
   for this with significant improvement in her symptoms.  No
   other positive cultures came back, excluding the
   possibility of disseminated sepsis.

1. Hypoxia.  This was believed likely to be due to diastolic
   CHF and hyperdynamic state following her sepsis.  She was
   managed with a non-rebreather in the ICU.  As her
   hemodynamics improved with the treatment of the sepsis, so
   did her shortness of breath.

1. Atrial fibrillation.  This remained relatively stable
   during the hospital course.

1. Acute renal failure.  The patient experienced acute renal
   failure most likely secondary to pre-renal azotemia.  This
   significantly improved with hydration.

1. Rheumatoid arthritis and lupus.  She was on stress dose
   steroids during the acute illness.


CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  The patient was ambulatory and able
to return home.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1. C.difficile colitis.
2. Sepsis.
3. Diastolic congestive heart failure.
4. Atrial fibrillation.
5. Rheumatoid arthritis.
6. Systemic lupus erythematosus.
7. Acute renal failure.


DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1. Coumadin 5 mg p.o. daily.
2. Prednisone taper.
3. Fentanyl 50 mcg TP.
4. Vitamin D and calcium.
5. Lasix 40 mg p.o. daily.
6. Protonix 40 mg p.o. daily.
7. Toprol-XL 25 mg p.o. daily.
8. Flagyl 500 mg p.o. t.i.d.
