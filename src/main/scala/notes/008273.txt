Allergies:
erythromycin

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4393**]
Chief Complaint:
Fever, hypotension, abdominal drainage

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Needle aspiration of abdominal fluid collection

History of Present Illness:
69yo female with cryptogenic cirrhosis complicated by HCC,
ascites and varices, COPD on home O2, dCHF and s/p umbilical
hernia repair [**6-6**], comes in with two days of fevers and
drainage from her umbilical surgery site. She had a fever two
days ago to 102, since then has had more low-grade temps. No
N/V, no dysuria. Does have diffuse abdominal pain that has been
stable since her umbilical hernia repair. She started having
serosanguinous drainage from the surgical site two days ago. She
actually feels that her abdomen is less swollen than previously.
She called her hepatologist and was instructed to come to the
ED.
.
In the ED, initial VS were: 98.6 68 105/54 16 98% RA. SBPs
dropped to the 70s, responded to fluids. Gave one dose of Zosyn.
No ascites clear to tap. Hyponatremia to 120. Transplant surgery
aspirated 300ccs from the fluid collection and sent for gram
stain and culture. Family refused central line, though the
patient is full code, given a fear of CVL placement not from
personal experience, but from things she has heard about them.
The ED did touch base with hepatology.
.
After fluid resuscitation and normalization of blood pressure,
the patient again became hypotensive to the 80s, asymptomatic,
but the decision was made at that time to admit the patient to
the intensive care unit for closer monitoring.
.
The transplant surgery team came to the ED to drain the fluid
collection, approximately 300cc serous fluid was drained.
.
Has 18G and 20G, s/p 2L IVF and 25gm albumin.
Vitals prior to admission 83/48 62 14 98% RA.
.
On arrival to the MICU, the patient is comfortable, reporting
[**5-21**] pain at her surgical site, [**11-20**] with palpation.

Past Medical History:
-Cryptogenic cirrhosis complicated by esophageal variceal
bleeding s/p banding, encephalopathy, ascites, caput medusae,
and hepatic hydrothorax.
-HCC (3cm liver lesion with AFP=16,322) s/p TACE with follow-up
AFP=2.1
-Iron deficiency anemia, presumed secondary to GI loss from
multiple AVMs and internal hemorrhoids (Baseline Hct 24-30)
-CAD status post possible MI.
-Diastolic, right sided CHF with EF greater than 55% ([**3-/2153**])
-Hypertension
-AAA s/p endovascular repair
-Pulmonary hypertension (per ECHO)
-CKI (Baseline Cr 1.0-1.4)
-COPD on home O2 and bronchodilators in the past. Currently not
requiring bronchodilators.
-GERD
-Right ankle surgery following injury in [**2128**], which prevents
her from being get MRIs.
-Prolapsed uterus.
-H/o Lower extremity cellulitis.
-s/p Tonsillectomy.

Imaging:

CT Abd/Pelvis: ([**2154-7-8**]):
IMPRESSION:
1.  Large non-hemorrhagic fluid collection in the anterior
subcutaneous
tissues at the site of prior hernia repair.  Further evaluation
is limited
without IV contrast. Superinfection cannot be excluded on this
study.
2.  Unchanged abdominal aortic aneurysm status post endovascular
repair.
3.  Diverticulosis without diverticulitis.
4.  Cirrhosis, splenomegaly, and abdominal varices are similar
to prior.

LENI ([**2154-7-8**]):
IMPRESSION:  No left lower extremity deep venous thrombosis.

TTE ([**2154-7-10**]): The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left
ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. Due to
suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality
cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%). Tissue Doppler imaging
suggests a normal left ventricular filling pressure
(PCWP<12mmHg). The right ventricular cavity is dilated with
depressed free wall contractility. The aortic root is mildly
dilated at the sinus level. The ascending aorta is mildly
dilated. The aortic arch is mildly dilated. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are structurally normal. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is mild
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
effusion.

IMPRESSION: Low normal left ventricular systolic function.
Dilated and hyokinetic right ventricle. Mild mitral
regurgitation. At least mild pulmonary h
