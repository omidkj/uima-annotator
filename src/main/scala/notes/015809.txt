Brief Hospital Course:
38 year old female with h/o type 1 diabetes, with recent
admission for DKA, returns several days later for hypoglycemia,
hypothermia, and altered mental status

# Altered mental status:  Likely secondary to hypoglycemia.
Head CT negative.  Tox screen negative for illicit substances.
PT had BS 40 per EMS.  Patient denies taking more insulin than
she should have.  She has however not been eating on a regular
schedule.  The patient was discharged the day prior to admission
after being hospitalized for DKA.  Consulted [**Last Name (un) **] for help
with diabetes management.  [**Last Name (un) **] felt that Humalog 75/25 was
not going to be a good choice for her because she does not
comply with a regular diet.  She was started on Lantus insulin
so that she would have some control although not optimal.  The
patient was given insulin via sliding scale in the hospital.
She is not compliant enough to use a sliding scale at home so
she will be instructed to take 4 units humalog with every meal.
She will follow up with [**Last Name (un) **] as an outpatient.

# Acute Anemia:  The patient's hematocrit was 34.1 at admission.
 It then dropped to mid 20s and fluctuated at that range for the
remainder of the admission, not requiring any transfusions.
(Her Hct has been in high 20s/low 30s most reccently.)  The
patient denied any GI bleeding or back pain.  Hemolysis labs
were unremarkable.  Stools were guaiac not checked as pt had not
passed any stool while hospitalized.

# Hypothermia, hypotension- Symptoms quickly resolved and were
thought to be due to hypoglycemia as no sign of infection/sepsis
(UA, CXR, BCx, WBC, TSH, Cortisol all negative or normal).

# DM1 - Blood sugars remainded labile fluctuating between 400s
and 60s. She was followed by [**Last Name (un) **], who made adjustments in her
basal and sliding scale insulin.

# Coag negative staph bacteremia, line associated)  The patient
was discharged to complete a 14 day course of vancomycin with
VNA.

# AMS - Based on timing and quick resolution, most likely also
due to hypoglycemia.

# CAD:  History of prior NSTEMI in setting of cocaine and DKA.
Pt was continued on Aspirin, Lisinopril, Toprol, Statin

# Acute renal failure: Improved quickly with fluids, thought to
be preranl.

# Chronic pain:  Continue home regimen of
Hydrocodone-Acetaminophen, gabapentin

# Anxiety:  Continue home benzo regimen

# GERD:  Stable.  Continue PPI.

# Phantom pain: Continue home percocet

# Peripheral Vascular disease, complicated by dry gangrene. Will
need outpatient follow up with vascular surgery
