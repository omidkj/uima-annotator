Physical Exam:
The blood pressure was 1442/47 mmHg supine.  The pulse was 83
bpm. The respiratory rate was 18.  The patient was afebrile.
Generally the patient appeared to be well developed, well
nourished and well groomed.  The patient was oriented to person,
place and time.
There was no xanthalesma and conjunctiva were pink with no
pallor
or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.  The neck was supple with JVP of
8 cm water.  The carotid waveform was normal.  There was no
thyromegaly.  The were no chest wall deformities, scoliosis or
kyphosis.  The respirations were not labored and there were no
use of accessory muscles. The lungs had rales at bases
bilaterally
Palpation of the heart revealed the PMI to be located in the 5th
intercostal space, mid clavicular line.
There were no thrills, lifts or palpable S3 or S4.
The heart sounds were irregular with a normal S1 and
physiologically split S2. There were no rubs, murmurs, clicks or
gallops.

The abdominal aorta was not enlarged by palpation. There was no
organomegaly or tenderness.

The extremities had no pallor, cyanosis, clubbing or edema.
There
were no abdominal, femoral or carotid bruits.

Inspection and/or palpation of skin and subcutaneous tissue
showed no stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.


Pertinent Results:
Conclusions
PRE BYPASS The left atrium is markedly dilated. Mild spontaneous
echo contrast is seen in the body of the left atrium. The left
atrial appendage emptying velocity is depressed (<0.2m/s). A
left atrial appendage thrombus is not seen but cannot be
completely excluded. The right atrium is dilated. A patent
foramen ovale is present. A left-to-right shunt across the
interatrial septum is seen at rest. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is
moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
mild to moderate hypokinesis of the anterior, anterolateral,
anteroseptal, and apical walls. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is moderately depressed (LVEF= 35 %). The
right ventricle displays mild global free wall hypokinesis.
There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch. The descending
thoracic aorta is mildly dilated. There are simple atheroma in
the descending thoracic aorta. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are
mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Trace
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Mild to moderate ([**1-14**]+) mitral regurgitation
is seen. There is a small pericardial effusion. Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in person of the results in the
operating room at the time of the study.

POST BYPASS The patient is in a junctional rhythm and is
receiving epinephrine by infusion. There is normal biventricular
systolic function with an LVEF of 55%. The mitral regurgitation
is improved - now trace to mild. The tricuspid regurgitation is
slightly worsened but still in the mild to moderate range. The
PFO remains with left to right flow evident. The thoracic aorta
appears intact. No other significant changes.
  I certify that I was present for this procedure in compliance
with HCFA regulations.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 82846**] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2180-7-21**] for further
management of his myocardial infarction. As his INR was elevated
due to coumadin, he was placed on heparin while awaiting his INR
to to trend down. He was worked-up in the usual preoperative
manner. He was noted to have a dropping hematocrit and a CT scan
was performed to rule out a retroperitoneal bleed. IABP was
removed. Scan showed no evidence of a retroperitoneal bleed
however showed a spiculated mesenteric soft tissue mass with a
punctate foci of calcification, and numerous omental/peritoneal
soft tissue implants. Markedly enlarged diaphragmatic lymph
nodes were also seen in the chest making the mass highly
suggestive of a malignancy.  The gastroenterology service was
consulted for assistance in his care who suggested a biopsy.
The cardiology service was also consulted in the event that a
malignancy was diagnosed and stenting was a possible option.
Oncology consulted and CT guided biopsy suggested carcinoid
tumor.

When his INR was normal, he was taken to OR on [**7-31**] for surgery
with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]. Transferred to the CVICU in stable condition
on epinephrine, propofol, and insulin drips. Extubated the next
morning and awoke neurologically intact. Transferred to the
floor on POD #1 . His temporary pacing wires and chest tubes
were removed per protocol. He was in atrial fibrillation and
developed brdaycardia. Electrophysiology and a pacer was
considered by deemed not necessary as his heart rate stabilized.
His couamdin for atrial fibrillation was resumed. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] will
resume coumadin follow up. Mr [**Known lastname 82846**] was evaluated by physical
therapy and cleared for discharge to home on POD #5.
