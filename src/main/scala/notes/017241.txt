History of Present Illness:
The pt is an 81 yo male with h/o A fib, CAD, ischemic EF 20%,
TIA in [**2194-2-23**], and recent GI illness who presented to [**Hospital1 **]
[**Location (un) 620**] with hypotension. Of note the he was discharged in early
[**2195-5-23**] with systolic CHF and ? gastroparesis vs bowel gut
edema. Since his discharge he was admitted to Brochton where he
was ruled out for MI and had an EGD.  He has since been at [**Location (un) 22092**] Short Term Rehab and has had increase somulence (in the
setting of marinol), decrease po intake due to fear of
nausea/vomiting, overall decreased weight since being discharged
from [**Hospital1 **]. He had emesis today at rehab.
.
The pt presented to [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] with lethargy with vitals of T
99.1 BP60/30 RR16 02 sat 100% by NC.  CTA per notes with no PE
and ? infiltrate. CT abd/pelvis showed increased thickening of
transverse colon. He had a low mixed venous sat, an increased
CVP, and cold/clammy extremities. Thus he was felt to be in
cardiogenic shock. A R IJ was placed under "relatively sterile
conditions."  Labs were notable for a WBC of 18 with 90%
neutrophils, therapuetic INR of 2.6, ABG of 7.46/20/149/14.2, NA
123, bicarv of 24, bili of 1.9, alk ph 174, ALT 49, AST 69,
lactate 2.1, trop T 0.024, and CK 131. Per report he received a
zosyn 3.375mg IV, hydrocortisone 100mg IV, and 5 L of NS.  K+
was hemolyzed at 6.6 and pt got 1 amp of calcium chloride, 1 amp
of D50, and 8 units of regular insulin.  On route to [**Hospital1 **] he
received vancomycin 1 gram IV x1, his levophed was weaned from
24 to 20, and he made 200cc of urine.
.
On arrival to the [**Hospital1 **] ICU his vitals were T94.5 107/79 22 95% on
2L. He reported no pain.
.
Review of systems: Notable for negative for chest pain, jaw
pain, arm pain, orthopnea, PND, or peripheral edema.
(-) Denies fever, chills, cough, shortness of breath, chest
pain,  diarrhea, abdominal pain. Denies arthralgias or myalgias.

[**2195-6-23**] Echo:
The left atrium is elongated. The right atrium is moderately
dilated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is severely depressed with septal,
anterior and apical akinesis with hypokinesis elsewhere (LVEF=
15 %). Cannot exclude apical thrombus. The right ventricular
cavity is mildly dilated with borderline normal free wall
function. The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is no
aortic valve stenosis. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is
seen. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a very small pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2195-5-27**],
ventricular function appears similar. Estimated pulmonary artery
systolic pressure is similar.
.
[**2195-6-25**] Rest Thallium:
Mild reversible perfusion defect in the inferior wall at 20
minutes. Mild-to-moderate left ventricular enlargement.
.
[**2195-6-27**] CXR:
Moderate cardiomegaly is stable. Left transvenous pacemaker lead
terminates in standard position in the right ventricle. There is
an abandoned right-sided lead. Right PICC remains in place.
There is no pneumothorax. If any, there is a small right pleural
effusion. Bibasilar opacities, greater on the right side, are
stable consistent with atelectasis.

Brief Hospital Course:
The pt is an 81 yo male with h/o A fib, CAD, ischemic EF 20%,
TIA in [**2194-2-23**], and recent GI illness who presents with
hypotension likely secondary to cardiogenic shock.
.
1. Cardiogenic shock:  Hypotension was suspected to be secondary
to poor EF. No evidence of infection or other cause of
hypotension at the time.  ECHO showed EF of 15% with severely
depressed LV function.  BP temporarily supported with pressors.
A thalium cardiac imaging test was done to determine if the
patient would benefit from reperfusion. It was decided that
patient would not benefit from this p
