Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 8814**] was taken to the operating room on [**2116-3-4**] by Dr.
[**First Name (STitle) **] for a right thoracoscopy converted to right thoracotomy,
right upper lobectomy, mediastinal lymph node dissection, for a
concerning right upper lobe nodule. She came out of the OR with
a right chest, foley and IV dilaudid for pain.  On [**2116-3-5**] she
was successfully extubated.  The patient transfered to the floor
on [**2116-3-6**]. Below is a systems review of the [**Hospital 228**] hospital

Neuro/Pain: The acute pain service was consulted postoperatively
and placed a Paravertebral catheter with Bupivacaine 0.25%
infusing and Dilaudid PCA.  This was dc'd [**2116-3-8**]. The patient
was placed on morphine IR, with good effect.

Respiratory: Aggressive pulmonary toilet was encouraged.
Nebulizers continued. Secretions were not an issue. The
patient's oxygen saturation decreased to 87% while ambulating
therefore she was sent home on 2L NC oxygen. The patient's
resting oxygen saturations were >92%. The right chest tube from
surgery did not have a leak and was dc'd [**2116-3-6**] with stable
postpull right apical pneumothorax.

CV: The patient remained hemodynamically stable without
arrythmia. She was started on metoprolol 12.5 mg po bid for both
EF 40% (echo done on ICU admission at bedside to evaluate true
cardiac function), and to prevent atrial fibrillation as the
patient was tachycardic (Initiating beta blockade discussed with
Dr. [**Name (NI) **], pt outpt cardiologist). The patient's I and O,
and daily weights were watched. She was given lasix [**2116-3-6**]. Her
dc weight was 100kg. There were no issues with heart failure.

Abd: Diet was advanced and tolerated on dc. Stool softeners
given to prevent constipation while on narcotics.

Renal: Foley was dc'd [**2116-3-6**] with good urine output following
such. Electrolytes were followed and replaced as necessary.

ID: CBC and fever curves were watched, without infectious issues
during this stay.

Lines: A right AC peripheral IV was continued on the floor and
dc'd prior to discharge. There was a small area of erythema
surrounding this site. It was seen by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] on date of
discharge, and pt told to take ibuprofen with arm elevation and
warm compresses. No antibiotics were needed at this time.

Proph: DVT proph: SCD's and heparin SQ. Ulcer proph: PPI.

Dispo: The patient was seen by Physical Therapy who cleared her
for home with home PT. She cleared stairs and was deemed stable
for discharge home by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] on [**2116-3-9**].
