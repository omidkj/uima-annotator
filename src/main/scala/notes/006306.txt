Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2181**]
Chief Complaint:
altered mental status

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Lumbar puncture
Left subclavian central line placement

History of Present Illness:
72yo man h/o Lymphoma dx 2 yrs ago s/p splenectomy, recent CVA
[**12-5**], DM, HTN who initally presented to [**Hospital1 1474**] ED on [**2200-6-10**]
with change in mental status x 2 days, rigors, and weakness. Pt
was unable to provide history at the time due to mumbling. Per
family pt vomited x 1, nonbloody nonbilious, F101. Pt had no HA,
neck stiffness, abd pain. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Hospital1 1474**] admission note ROS pos
for loose stool, rinorrhea/cough and increased L arm weakness.
Temp initally was 102.2 BP 170s/80s HR 120s, Sat 92% RA. Pt was
roncherous on exam and CXR revealed a RML infiltrate. WBC was
7.6 with 46%lymphs. Head CT was perfomed and was neg for mass
effect or bleed. Pt was admitted to floor, started on
Ceftriaxone/Azithro. Repeat CXR was read as "bibasilar airspace
dz, no CHF." Flagyl was added for possible aspiration. Blood
cultures collected in the ED grew strep pneumo. Vanc was added
and azithro d/c'd. mental status worsened and pt become
unresponsive. MRI was negative for new infarct. LP was attempted
on [**6-11**] unsuccessfully due to body habitus.

Past Medical History:
1. Leukopenia
2. Splenic Marginal Zone Lymphoma: s/p splenectomy. initially
diagnosed in [**9-1**] when he developed a cough, and then in [**12-2**]
when he developed dyspnea and weight loss. A pleural effusion
was found and drained.  Pathology showed malignant cells
consistent with B-cell clonal lymphoproliferative disorder. CT
showed splenomegaly; bone scan apparently showed diffuse uptake
in sternum, pelvis and lumbar vertebral bodies, suggestive of
diffuse bone marrow involvement. The patient had a splenectomy,
and the pathology was consistent with marginal zone lymphoma. He
has elected for no further treatment after discussion with
primary oncologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 28049**] at [**Hospital3 328**].

Flow Results- '[**96**]: Abnormal/lymphoma cells comprise 65% of total
gated events. B cells demonstrate a monoclonal kappa light chain
restricted population. They co-express pan-B markers CD19, 20,
22 along with FMC7. A subset of cells appear to express CD23.
They do not express any other characteristic antigens including
CD5 or CD10.
3. CVA [**12-5**] likely watershed infarct from hypotension during
sepsis of unclear source. (TTE neg, Carotid U/S neg)
4. DM II- insulin requiring

6. CRI
7. GERD
8. anticardiolipin Ab

HEAD MRI ([**2200-6-19**]): Several foci of increased T1 signal
abnormality within the cerebellum and right frontal lobe, which
likely represents sequelae from old ischemia. No acute ischemia
is identified. There is no meningeal enhancement or focal
abscesses identified.

ABDOMEN/PELVIS CT ([**2200-6-24**]):
1. Small-bowel obstruction with dilated, edematous proximal
small bowel loops. Distal small bowel and colon are collapsed.
Transition point is probably in the right lower quadrant. This
was discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 9768**] in person at approximately 5 o'clock
a.m., [**2200-6-24**].

2. Bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left, with
compressive atelectasis.


Brief Hospital Course:
In the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], the patient had an LP that showed 600 WBC and 60%
polys. The patient was given a four day course of dexamethasone
for presumed pneumococcal meningitis. The patient was also noted
to have swelling of his knees R > L. Due to suspicion for septic
joints the patient has bilateral arthrocentesis which
inflammatory rather than septic arthritis. The patient's strep
pneumo was found to be pan-sensitive from the outside hospital
so he was maintained on just ceftriaxone for a 14 day course.
.
[**6-15**] the patient was transferred to the floor. An MRI head was
obtained due to concerns of lethargy and slow movement. The
study showed evidence of old emboli but no acute changes. The
patients mental status improved and he eventually passed a video
swallow to transition from TF to po thin liquids and ground
solids. [**6-19**] ENT consult was called to evaluate the patient for
his soft voice and proper closure of his vocal cords. ENT saw
evidence of bowing of the cords w/ phonation as well as evidence
of larygopharyngeal reflux. He was started on a PPI. [**6-19**] the
patient had a PICC line placed for abx. His urine also grew
enterococcus. [**6-21**] the patient spiked a fever to 100.8. [**6-23**] pt
spiked a fever to 100.1 and also had three bouts of emesis after
eating lunch. Abd plain film showed dilated loops of bowel. CT
abd showed SBO vs. partial SBO. Surgery consult was called and
the patient was made NPO and NGT was placed for gastric
decompression. The patient was then transferred to the [**Hospital Ward Name **] for closer monitoring in case he required surgical
intervention. Pt had completed his 14 day course of ceftriaxone
for pneumococcal meningitis/bacteremia.  On the [**Hospital Ward Name **] the
patient remained NPO for ~ 3 days and was fed via TPN.  He
eventually began to pass gas and stool.  He diet was slowly
advanced and eventually the patient was tolerating po's well and
was taken off TPN.  Prior to discharge, he was taking good po
and having good bowel movement.

Of note, his last recorded pneumovax shot at his PCP was in
[**2193**]. Given this course, it was felt that he should have a
bootster shot which was admisistered on [**6-17**].

2) L knee pain: Felt to be secondary to trauma of the left knee.
Arthrocentesis consistent with inflammatory joint. No evidence
of septic joint or crystal deposition. Plain film negative. Pain
was controlled with tylenol prn.

3) L arm weakness: Likely manifestation of old infarct. The plan
is for physical therapy for continued rehabilitation.

4) Anemia and hyperbilirubinemia: Initially he had an indirect
bili concerning for hemolysis, however T bili was down-trending
and hapto/LDH were within normal limits suggesting against
ongoing hemolysis. Direct coombs was also negative. He was
transfused 2 units pRBCs with subsequently stable hct. Iron
studies were consistent with AOCD + retic count low suggestive
of hypoproliferative state (likely secondary to underlying MZL).
He required no further blood transfusions.

5) splenic MZL: s/p sple
