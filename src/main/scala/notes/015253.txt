Brief Hospital Course:
 Patient was transferred from an OSH with known diagnosis of
hemothorax and multiple rib fractures and was seen and
stabilized in the trauma bay. After receiving FFP to correct his
elevated INR, a chest tube was placed with ~1600cc output on
placement. He was admitted to the ICU for management and his
chest tube output was followed. He required 5 units of pRBCs to
maintain adequate hematocrit, and this was followed and
transfused as needed throughout the remainder of his stay.

On HD 2, the patient was c/o significant pain and this was
affecting his respiratory status/pulmonary toilet so the Acute
Pain Service was consulted regarding epidural placement. They
determined the patient would be best served by placement of a
paravertebral block and this was performed at the bed side.
Following this, the patient was transferred to the floor for
further management.

On the floor his respiratory status was adequate, but he
continued to complain of significant pain, so he was started on
a Dilaudid PCA. Additionally because of his c/o shoulder pain he
was evaluated by the orthopedics service, who indicated that no
acute intervention was needed, and the patient could follow up
with them as an outpatient.

On [**6-13**] the patient was triggered for mental status changes which
were determined to be from his narcotics. Additionally, he had
some difficulty maintaining his sats and his O2 requirements
were increasing. Because of this he was transferred to the ICU
with a plan to have an epidural placed by the acute pain
service, which was performed without difficulty. The patient
stayed in the ICU overnight for monitoring of his blood
pressures [**1-10**] concern for hypotension given his volume status
and new epidural placement. After he was stable and his epidural
was functioning he was transferred back to the floor for further
management.

His epidural was eventually removed and he was placed on an oral
regimen. His chest tube was also removed; he is on his home
pulmonary meds and prn nebulizers. He was evaluated by Physical
therapy and is being recommended for rehab after his acute
hospital stay.

On [**6-17**] the patient went into rapid atrial fibrillation and
respiratory distress with a fever of 102 F, and altered mental
status.   He required a total of 15 mg IV lopressor pushed and
he returned to [**Location 213**] sinus rhythm.  CXR and stat labs/cultures
were sent and he was found to have a leukocytosis. Given his
acute respiratory distress he required intubation.

On [**2158-6-18**], Patient brought to OR with Thoracic surgery for
right video-assisted thoracoscopy which was converted to right
thoracotomy.  Three chest tubes were placed in the chest.  The
most anterior tube was a right-angle tube. The middle tube was
and anterior apical tube and the more posterior tube at the skin
was a posterior apical tube.

The patient was started on tube feeds.  His blood cultures 7/10
grew MSSA.  [**6-17**] Ucx grew PROBABLE ENTEROCOCCUS ~5000/ML. [**6-18**]
Pleural clot cultures demonstrated MRSA.

[**6-22**]:  [**Name (NI) **] wife was consented for trach and PEG, this was
performed without complication after tube feeds were held for
the appropriate amount of time preop.  Pain control still an
issue.  Started Roxicet via G tube.
[**6-23**] Tube feeds started via PEG tube, patient tolerating this
well. + BM's
7/17 L PICC line placed.  Lasix gtt for diuresis.  Started on
diamox for increasing respiratoy acidosis with lasix. Chest CT
performed.
[**6-25**] 1 chest tube removed and 2 chest tubes remaining placed to
pneumostat by Thoracic surgery team.  Tube feeds advanced to
goal of 50cc/hr
[**2158-6-26**] Chest tube x2 placed to pneumostat.  Continued on
Vancomycin and Zosyn.  Tube feeds at goal.  Dispo planning.
[**6-26**]: No acute events. Secretions noted to be thicker, sputum gs
and cx sent.
[**6-27**]: Started on seroquel for anxiety/agitation and discontinued
zyprexa. Patient had high residuals from tube feeds (~500ml),
tube feeds were held and PEG was clamped.  Sputum culture
growing heavy pseudomonas
[**6-28**]: TF residuals ~400cc/24hr, decreased rate and thickness.
Erythromycin 250mg PO Q6h. Anterior chest tube d/c'd
[**6-29**]: Patients chest tube was discontinued and the patient was
discharged to a long term acute care facility
