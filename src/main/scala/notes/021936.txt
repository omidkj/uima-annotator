Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 695**]
Chief Complaint:
Metastatic colon cancer to the liver.


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2118-4-29**]:  Right hepatic lobectomy, cholecystectomy, left lateral
segment mass resection, intraoperative ultrasound.


History of Present Illness:
Per Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 4727**] operative note: The patient is a 79-year- old
female with an extensive past medical history including thymoma,
myasthenia [**Last Name (un) 2902**] requiring immunosuppressive therapy, carcinoma
of the colon, status post a sigmoid
resection in [**2113**], and subsequent development of a lung nodule
which we resected and found to be a well-differentiated
bronchoalveolar carcinoma.  She developed a second lung nodule
that was not FDG-avid and it was stable from prior exams.  She
was noted to have a positive segment-VII lesion in the liver,
which was treated with radiofrequency ablation on [**2117-6-23**].
She had a follow-up scan on [**2118-1-29**], that showed 3 areas
of focal increased FDG
uptake in the right lobe of the liver.  The liver biopsy in
[**2-22**] demonstrated metastatic colon cancer.  She underwent
a triphasic CT scan of the abdomen on [**2118-3-15**], that
demonstrated 3 areas of hyperdensity in the right lobe of the
liver.  She had a lesion in segment, one in segment VIII, and
one in segment VI.  She also has cholelithiasis.  The superior
two foci are adjacent to the fiducial markers and measure 3.3 x
3.1 cm and 2.7 x 1.9 cm,
and a segment-6 lesion measures 1.5 x 0.8 cm.
Chest CT on [**2117-10-28**], demonstrated no evidence of
pulmonary metastases.  She underwent a thorough preoperative
evaluation including a pulmonary function tests that were
satisfactory.  Her preoperative liver function tests were
normal, and her CEA was 31.  She also had an echocardiogram and
dipyridamole stress test, that also were satisfactory and she
was cleared from a cardiac standpoint.  She is now brought to
the operating room after informed consent was
obtained for a right hepatic lobectomy and cholecystectomy.

Pathology
I.  Gallbladder, cholecystectomy:
1.  Mild chronic cholecystitis.
2.  Cholelithiasis, mixed-type.
II.  Liver, right lobe, lobectomy
1.  Metastatic adenocarcinoma, morphologically consistent with a
colonic primary; see note.
2.  Parenchymal resection margin is free of tumor.
3.  Non-neoplastic hepatic parenchyma with patchy, mild mixed
portal inflammation and focal bile ductular proliferation,
suggestive of a minor component of obstruction. Minimal
steatosis is identified (involving <5% of the parenchyma); no
iron deposition is seen on iron stain. Trichrome stain
demonstrates focal, mild expansion of portal fibrous tissue.
III.  Liver, left lateral segment, segmentectomy:
1.  Metastatic adenocarcinoma, morphologically consistent with a
colonic primary; see note.
2.  Parenchymal resection margin is free of tumor.
.
Note:  Immunostains of the tumor are positive for cytokeratin 20
and CDX2, and negative for CK7 and TTF-1, with satisfactory
controls.  This immunophenotype is consistent with a colonic
origin, supporting the above morphologic diagnosis.


Brief Hospital Course:
79 y/o female taken to the OR with Dr [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] for Right
hepatic lobectomy, cholecystectomy,left lateral segment mass
resection, intraoperative ultrasound.
Per the operative report she had dense adhesions in the right
upper quadrant and a
normal-appearing liver.  There were multiple lesions in the
right lobe of the liver that could be palpated and were present
by intraoperative ultrasound.  A lesion in the dome of the liver
was adherent to the diaphragm.  She also had a second, separate,
1.5-cm nodule in the left lateral segment near the edge,
consistent with metastatic disease. There was no evidence of
other extrahepatic disease.  Please see op note for detail. It
is noted there was 25 minutes of Pringle maneuver and specimens
initially examined appeared to have margins free of tumor.
She was transferred to the SICU following surgery due to
concerns regarding her myasthenia [**Last Name (un) 2902**], although she remained
quite stable and was extubated in the afternoon day of surgery.
Final pathology was available prior to discharge and showed both
right lobe and left lateral segment as  Metastatic
adenocarcinoma, morphologically consistent with a colonic
primary with parenchymal resection margins free of tumor.
Immediately post op the patient developed nausea and vomiting
and an NGT was placed. Additionally her UOP was poor (245 cc)
and she was bolused several times for total 2500 cc, UOP ranged
from 10-45 cc/hr.
The NG tube was removed POD 1, sips to clears tolerated on POD
2.
Hct noted to be 23.8% on POD 4 and was transfused two units RBCs
with appropriate and then stable Hct response.
JP drain output was noted to appear bilious by POD 3 with a
level of 16.4 (serum 0.3)
This has remained bilious throughout the hospitalization with
daily outputs ranging from 155- 490 cc.
Liver enzymes were immediately elevated post op (25 minutes
Pringle) However these trended down daily, with AST 730 peak, 43
at discharge, ALT peak 638, 171 at discharge. T bili was noted
to be trending up and will be rechecked on [**5-6**]. Alk phos
stable.
She was transferred out of the ICU on POD 4 and continued to
make daily improvements. She was tolerating diet, incision
remained C/D/I.
Evaluation by PT initially recommended rehab, however with daily
work she progressed to being stable for home with full services
to include OT, PT, [**Hospital 50236**] [**Name (NI) **] health aide and safety
evaluation. She has multiple assisitive devices already in
place.
She intermittently seems slightly confused, but then orients
completely.
Imuran was immediately restarted following surgery, she was able
to be weaned off O2 by POD 5, myasthenia [**Last Name (un) 2902**] appears stable
post operatively.
