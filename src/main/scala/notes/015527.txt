Service:  #58

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 54 year old man
who has a history of atrial fibrillation diagnosed in
[**2197-12-9**].  He was asymptomatic at the time, and it is
unclear exactly when his atrial fibrillation began.  The
patient was started on Coumadin and has been on metoprolol
for rate control.

Approximately a year ago, the patient had a failed
cardioversion at an outside facility.  The patient had an
exercise stress test which was negative.  An echocardiogram
showed a mildly dilated left atrium with mild left
ventricular hypertrophy.  The patient was referred to [**Hospital1 1444**] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for a
pulmonary vein ablation.  The patient was admitted currently
for this procedure.  He had a transesophageal echocardiogram
prior to the procedure, and it disclosed a dilated left
atrium with no evidence of thrombus.  During the procedure,
the patient was noted to have a systolic blood pressure down
to the seventies, and a pericardial effusion was noted.  An
emergent pericardiocentesis was performed, with removal of
480 cc of sanguinous fluid.  It was thought that the patient
had a perforation during the procedure, leading to
pericardial effusion and tamponade.  While in the
electrophysiology laboratory, the patient received
intravenous fluids and one unit of packed red blood cells
with improvement in his blood pressure and normalization of
the pulsus paradoxus.  A pericardial drain was also placed
for drainage of any further accumulation of fluid.  The
patient was transferred to the CCU for further monitoring and
management.

1. Migraines.
2. Umbilical hernia.
3. Atrial fibrillation.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is married and works as a
consultant.  Occasional alcohol.  No tobacco or other drug
use.

FAMILY HISTORY:  The patient has several uncles with atrial
fibrillation. However, there is no history of sudden cardiac
death in the family.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
VITAL SIGNS:  Temperature 96.2, blood pressure 114/67, heart
rate 74, respiratory rate 16, oxygen saturation 100% on
assist control 800 by 12 on 100% O2.
GENERAL:  The patient is intubated and sedated.
HEENT:  Normocephalic, atraumatic.  Pupils are equal, round,
and reactive to light.  Endotracheal tube was in place.
NECK:  No jugular venous distention.
CARDIOVASCULAR: Regular rate and rhythm with normal S1 and S2
and no murmur, rub or gallops.  There is a pericardial drain
in place.
LUNGS:  Clear to auscultation anteriorly.
ABDOMEN:  Benign.
EXTREMITIES:  No edema.  Good distal pulses. The patient has
a right arterial femoral artery sheath.

LABS ON ADMISSION:  CBC shows a white count of 9.6,
hematocrit 38.6, platelet count 166.  Chem-7 is within normal
limits except for a bicarbonate of 22.  INR is 1.3.  The last
arterial blood gases showed pH 7.29, pCO2 41 and pO2 of 304
on the ventilator settings of assist control 800 cc x 14
breaths per minute at 100% FIO2 and 5 of PEEP.

ELECTROCARDIOGRAM:  Post-procedure electrocardiogram showed
normal sinus rhythm with sinus arrhythmia with normal
interval and normal axis.  There was a left atrial
enlargement.

SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE BY ISSUE:

1. Cardiac tamponade.  The patient had a pericardial drain
placed in the E.P. laboratory for continual drainage of the
pericardial fluid to prevent tamponade.  Initially the
pericardial drain put out approximately 400 cc over the first
12 - 24 hours.  However, this output slowly tapered off.  A
repeat echocardiogram was done, which did not show any
significant new fluid accumulation.  The drain was removed at
that time.  During the hospital course, the patient's
hematocrit remained stable.

Initially, the patient's anticoagulation was held for several
days after the removal of the pericardial drain.  It was then
restarted.  There were no further signs of pericardial
tamponade.

2. Atrial fibrillation.  The patient was in normal sinus
rhythm briefly after the pulmonary vein ablation procedure.
However, the morning after being admitted to the CCU, the
patient reverted back into atrial fibrillation with a rapid
rate.  He received several doses of intravenous Lopressor for
rate control.  He was then restarted on Lopressor p.o.  As he
could not be anticoagulation with Coumadin initially, he was
only placed on aspirin.  Since the patient had reverted back
to atrial fibrillation, he was taken for another attempt at
D.C. cardioversion.  This was performed the day prior to
discharge, and was only successful temporarily.  After a
brief period in normal sinus rhythm, the patient reverted
back to atrial fibrillation.

The patient was continued on Toprol XL for rate control at
that point, after the failed cardioversion.  He was restarted
on anticoagulation with Coumadin.  The patient was also
started on p.o. amiodarone.  He was to take 400 mg b.i.d. x
two weeks, then 400 mg once a day for one week, at which
point he would be re-evaluated by the electrophysiology
service for a possible repeat D. C. cardioversion.

3. Respiratory status.  The patient arrived to the CCU
intubated due to the procedure.  His sedation with propofol
was quickly weaned off, and he was changed over to pressor
support and then extubated without any complications.  He did
have some hypoxia after being extubated.  It was thought that
this was secondary to splinting from the pain that he was
having due to the pericardial drain that was in place.  Once
his pain improved and the patient was able to take deep
inspirations, his oxygenation improved.

4. Pain control.  The patient was in a significant amount of
pain while his pericardial drain was in place, due to the
irritation.  He was maintained on high doses of narcotics for
pain relief, though he never achieved complete relief until
the pericardial drain was removed.

5. Cardiomyopathy.  The echocardiogram done showed that the
patient had an ejection fraction of 20-25%.  This was thought
possibly secondary to chronic atrial fibrillation.  The
patient was started on an ACE inhibitor for afterload
reduction and treatment of heart failure.  He was discharged
on Zestril 5 mg q day.  He had no signs or symptoms of acute
heart failure or decompensation.

6. Code status.  The patient was full code on admission and
at discharge.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  The patient was discharged home.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  The patient was in good condition.  He
was hemodynamically stable.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1. Atrial fibrillation.
2. Pericardial effusion.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1. Aspirin 81 mg q day.
2. Lopressor 75 mg q day.
3. Zestril 5 mg q day.
4. Coumadin 7.5 mg q h.s.
5. Amiodarone 400 mg b.i.d. for one week, then 400 mg once a
day for the following three weeks.

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS AND FOLLOWUP PLANS:  The patient was
to have his INR checked in two to three days after discharge
for adjustment of his Coumadin to a goal INR of [**3-13**].  The
patient was to call Dr.[**Name (NI) 7914**] office to follow up in
appointment in about one month for possible repeat
cardioversion.  He is also to see his primary care physician
in two to four weeks.
