Service:  MICU

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Transferred from outside hospital for
thrombocytopenia.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Patient is a 72-year-old
gentleman who was transferred from [**Hospital6 2561**] for
concern for TTP.  Patient initially had presented on [**2179-2-28**] with a [**2-2**] day history of URI symptoms and was found
to be hypotensive and admitted with pneumonia and sepsis.
Patient required intubation and was treated with ceftriaxone,
azithromycin, and Flagyl with improvement over the next few
days.  Patient was extubated.  During that time, patient also
had a troponin leak and a catheterization was done that
showed one-vessel disease with a RCA occlusion of 70-80%.

Patient also had an abdominal CT at the outside hospital that
showed a questionable adrenal mass, however, patient was
discharged home on [**3-6**] on Augmentin and Flagyl.  A
couple of days later the patient began to have copious
diarrhea stating about 15-20 bowel movements in a 24-hour
period, and also developed altered mental status and fever up
to 106 degrees.  The patient returned back to [**Hospital6 **], where he was found to have mild elevation of his
creatinine to 2.7, and he was intubated for airway protection
during the performance of a lumbar puncture since patient was
oversedated.

The lumbar puncture at the outside hospital showed no
evidence of any infection, however, the patient was started
on ceftriaxone and p.o. vancomycin.  Subsequently, the
patient developed thrombocytopenia with schistocytes and was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation, questionable
plasmapheresis.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. TIA/CVD.
2. Hypertension.
3. Hyperlipidemia.
4. CAD - Catheterization on [**2179-2-28**] that showed
70-80% mid RCA stenosis and 40-50% LAD stenosis.
5. Obesity.
6. Chronic lower back pain with sciatica.
7. Mild CHF with an EF of 45%, apical hypokinesis.
8. Questionable seizure disorder.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1. Atenolol 50 mg p.o. q.d.
2. Aspirin 81 mg p.o. q.d.

ALT 1783, alkaline phosphatase 99, total bilirubin 1.3, total
protein of 4.5, and albumin 2.1.  PT 12.7, INR 1.1, PTT 23.

ABG:  7.51, 20, 164.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. Respiratory -  The patient was initially intubated for
airway protection after being sedated during the procedure of
a LP.  Patient had a LP done because he presented with an
acute mental status change.  The LP showed no evidence of
infection, however, through the course of the hospital stay,
it became difficult to extubate the patient and an attempt
was made to wean him off his vent, but patient was not
successful, and so patient was eventually trached.

On his trach, patient has been on pressure support of 20 with
PEEP of 5, and is slowly being weaned.  On the day of this
discharge summary, patient is on pressure support of 10 and
PEEP of 5 with a FIO2 of 40% and patient seems to be doing
well.  We will continue to wean his vent settings as
tolerated.

2. Thrombocytopenia - Patient presented with acute
thrombocytopenia with the initial thinking of TTP.  However,
since the patient was exposed to Heparin in the outside
hospital, a HIT antibody was sent, which returned positive.
Patient also had a right upper extremity ultrasound that was
done due to increased swelling of his right upper extremity
and he was found to have a right subclavian thrombus.  The
patient was started on lepirudin drip as per the
Hematology/Oncology team for anticoagulation.

Patient's platelets slowly rose and at the time of this
discharge summary, the patient's platelets were 139.  Patient
was also started on Coumadin as patient is going to require
about six months of anticoagulation with goal INR of [**2-2**].
Patient will be on both lepirudin drip and Coumadin until his
INR hits 4.  At that time his lepirudin drip will be stopped
and patient will continue Coumadin.

3. Infectious disease - Patient presented febrile with an
elevated white count.  Blood cultures were drawn at the time
of arrival to [**Hospital1 18**] and the patient was 6/6 bottles positive
for Enterococcal bacteremia.  Patient was initially started
on gentamicin and ampicillin for broad coverage.  The source
of the infection was unclear, but it was thought to be
secondary to nosocomial exposure in the outside hospital and
ID team was also consulted for concern that patient may have
seeded in his right subclavian thrombus and possible cardiac
valve.

During his hospital course when it was difficult to extubate
him, a chest x-ray was obtained that showed possible left
lower lobe pneumonia and patient was thought to develop
vent-associated pneumonia.  Patient was started on vancomycin
and cefepime for vent-associated pneumonia, and the
ampicillin was stopped since the vancomycin would cover for
the Enterococcal bacteremia.

As per discussion with the ID team, it was decided that
patient will complete a six-week course of gentamicin 120 mg
IV b.i.d. and vancomycin 1 gram IV b.i.d. as tolerated.  If
patient develops renal insufficiency, the gentamicin will be
stopped and patient will continue vancomycin.  Patient also
had a transesophageal echocardiogram that was done to rule
out endocarditis.  No vegetations were seen, however, there
was a highly mobile complex atheroma of 3 x 0.7 cm located in
the distal aortic arch and proximal descending aorta.  After
discussing these findings with the ID team and the fact the
patient had endovascular infection, it was decided that we
will still continue the six-week course of antibiotic.

Patient will get a total of two weeks of cefepime 2 grams IV
q.8 for vent-associated pneumonia, which should be stopped on
[**2179-4-4**].

4. Cardiology - There was some concern that patient may have
developed endocarditis given his high degree of bacteremia.
Patient received a transesophageal echocardiogram that was
unremarkable except for this mobile complex atheroma found in
the aortic arch and the proximal descending aorta.  It was
decided that he would anticoagulate for this finding.
Patient also has a history of hypertension and patient was on
Lopressor 75 mg p.o. b.i.d. at the time of this discharge
summary.

5. Neurologic:  Patient was initially intubated due to
oversedation and decreased mental status during the procedure
of a LP.  However, after intubation, patient's motor function
did not improve and patient continued to have decreased
mental status with occasional spontaneous movement of the
head.  Patient did not respond to any commands.  The Neuro
team was consulted, who recommended obtaining a MRI and an
EEG, both of which were unremarkable.  The concern came for
Guillain-[**Location (un) **] syndrome versus ICU polyneuropathy.

At the time of this discharge summary, ongoing discussions
were held with the Neuro team regarding performing an EMG to
rule out Guillain-[**Location (un) **] syndrome.  In addition, there was
some concern about patient having a seizure since the patient
was on Keppra 500 mg p.o. b.i.d., which the Neuro team
recommended to continue.

6. Renal -
