[**3-26**] CXR:
There is a moderate-sized right pleural effusion with adjacent
compressive atelectasis. No definite focal consolidation is
seen, although
the evaluation is limited by the presence of the effusion. The
left lung is
largely clear. There is a tortuous aorta. The cardiac silhouette
size is
difficult to fully assess but is borderline enlarged. There is a

dextroconcave curvature of the thoracic spine with the more
cephalad aspects
of the lumbar spine suggesting a compensatory levoconcave
curvature. No
significant superimposed edema is seen. No underlying
pneumothorax is noted.

IMPRESSION: Moderate-sized right pleural effusion with adjacent
atelectasis.
No definite focal consolidation is seen, although an early
developing
pneumonia cannot be excluded on the basis of this examination.
Short interval
followup imaging recommended as clinically indicated.

[**3-26**] CT torso:
1. Bilateral lower lobe airspace consolidation, left greater
than right.
While there is a component of atelectasis, areas of
heterogeneous enhancement
are worrisome for pneumonia. Air attenuation foci within the
right lower lobe
likely represent areated lung, however, attention on follow-up
studies is
recommended to exclude cavitation/abscess formation.
2. Emphysema.
3. 4-cm infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm.
4. Massive ventral abdominal hernia. The liver, gallbladder,
small bowel,
and colon lie directly under the skin surface. This likely
accounts for the
physical exam finding of "crepitus".


Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname **] is a 72 y/o F w/ h/o COPD, s/p previous trach with
recent treatment for pneumonia who p/w leukocytosis, fever, and
abdominal pain found to have bilateral lower lobe pneumonias.

vancomycin and cefepime, and will require a total of 10 days of
antimicrobial therapy. A PICC line wsa placed during her
admission without complications.  The patient intially had an
increased O2 requirement above baseline (3L nc), and on
discharge was at baseline O2 requirement.  Instructions for
antimicrobial therapy are:
Vancomycin 1g IV Q12H (STOP [**2161-4-5**])
Cefepime 2g IV Q12H (STOP [**2161-4-5**])

a negative stool C.diff [**Doctor First Name **]. She was treated with prn
oxycodone durin her admission.

3. CAD: Continued on ASA and metoprolol during admission.

4. COPD: Continued on home flovent MDI and nebs during
admission.

5. CHF: On discharge, patient was euvolemic. Her metoprolol was
intially held on admission over concerns of possible sepsis, but
was restarted by the time of discharge.

6. Abdominal aortic aneurysm: Patient found to have 4 cm AAA on
CT, which will require surveillance as an outpatient.

7. Hypertension: Patient's amlodipine and metoprolol were held
on admission over concern of sepsis, but were restarted during
her hospitalization.

8. DM 2: Continue [**Male First Name (un) **] HISS
