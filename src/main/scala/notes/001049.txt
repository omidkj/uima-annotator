Chief Complaint:
myasthenia w/ worsening upper extremity weakness

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Thymectomy [**2198-6-1**]


History of Present Illness:
The patient is a delightful 53-
year-old woman who had been having symptoms consistent with
myasthenia, dating back 5-7 years. She was diagnosed with
myasthenia and placed on prednisone in 10/[**2195**].  Her
symptoms, at the time, included mostly weakness of the upper
and lower extremities and initially episodes of double vision
and some dysphagia.  Since starting the medical therapy, she
has had no double vision or dysphagia but has been having
worsening weakness of her upper and lower extremities with a
tendency to drop items that she picks up.  She also had other
little changes that she noticed when her medication was
weaned aggressively.  She has been treated with Imuran and
Azathioprine and had been treated with high dose steroids for
a significant period of time. She was seen by another surgeon
at the [**Hospital3 **] who felt that a surgical resection was
not indicated, particularly given her obesity and high dose
steroids and the potentially limited beneficial effects for
myasthenia [**Last Name (un) 2902**]. She presented to me for a second opinion
and our evaluation found a thymoma within the thymus.
Therefore, she had to have a resection for oncological
purposes.
