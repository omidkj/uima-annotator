Past Medical History:
. HTN
2. DM2
3. CHF, EF 65% by Echo [**2181-10-3**]
4. COPD on home O2
PFTs [**9-5**]: "FVC:moderately to severely reduced. The FEV1 and
FEV1/FVC ratio are severely reduced.

excursion.  Impression: Marked obstructive ventilatory defect.
The reduced FVC likely reflects gas trapping although a
concurrent restrictive process cannot be ruled out."

Brief Hospital Course:
77 y.o. male with COPD on home O2 now s/p trach/PEG [**10-22**] during
admission for MRSA PNA presented from rehab with progessive
hypoxemia x 1 week and acute renal failure.  The hypoxia was of
unclear time course.  He was noted to have sat of 90% on FiO2 of
70%.  Here his initial ABG demonstrating ARDS by P/F ratio of
100 and CXR with b/l lower lobe infiltrates.  He was managed
with ARDS-NET Vent strategy 6cc/kg.  His Ht is 5'8" so 6cc/kg of
IBW would be ~400 ccs, his HOB was elevated, his PIPs and
Plateau pressures were closely monitored.  An Echo with bubble
study was performed to assess for shunt showed no shunt.  With
concern for PE lower extremity ultrasounds were performed and
were negative.  However as he continued to be hypoxic he was
started on Heparin drip for possible PE given new RV dilation
and Pulm HTN on Echo [**2181-11-12**].  Efforts were made to monitor
Pplat closely and keep <35.  Heparin also continued for AFib and
Left IJ clot.  CTA was not performed due to renal failure.  On
[**11-26**] had increased secretions around trach site but not so much
from suctioning; continued pulmonary toilet.  On [**12-1**] he was
paralyzed to help with oxygenation.  He continued to require
aggressive settings on ventilator.  He had little improvement in
his respiratory status.  He also required antibiotics for
ventilator associated pneumonia.  His blood pressure required
pressor support.  On [**12-6**] he passed away from
cardiovascular collapse after requiring four pressors with no
blood pressure response.

Secondary issues
Hypercapnic Resp Failure - likely has high pCO2 at baseline
given severe COPD.  pCO2 was maintained in the 50's with a
strategy of permissive hypercapnea.  He was treated with
steroids given his underlying COPD.  He was also treated with
nebulizers [**Hospital 107407**] hospital [**Last Name (un) 10128**].

Sepsis - He completed 7 day course of inhaled tobramycin for
Acinetobacter VAP.  He grew GPC in his sputum [**11-24**] with acute
worsening including fever and hypotension.  The final speciation
was MRSA.  On [**11-26**] sources of infection likely MRSA VAP or
peri-trachostomy abscess/tracheobronchitis.  He was maintained
on Vancomycin.  He was briefly in tigarcillin and gent for
history of acinitobacter in his sputum however this was
discontinued when he grew MRSA.  On [**12-1**] he grew G- rods in
Blood culture.  His abx were changed to meropenem, vanc by
levels and gent by levels.  Despite continued antibiotics he was
requiring ongoing pressor support with Levophed and Vasopressin.
 On [**12-5**] his pressor requirement increased dramatically,
he was maxed out on four pressors at the time of his death.

Acid-Base: On [**11-26**] he had a metabolic acidosis with anion gap;
lactate was only 1.6 but BUN 130's.  Thus it was felt his
metabolic acidosis was from uremia.  He was treated with bicarb
and dialysis as needed.

ARF - This was felt to be likely secondary to ATN.  He was
initiated on dialysis via a right sub-clavian catheter.  He
later had dialysis via a right femoral catheter however there
were difficulties with flow.  He then got a new right subclavian
dialysis catheter and was started on CVVH given his continued
hypotension.  He was treated with phosphate binders and all meds
were renally dosed.

Anemia - He had several drops in his HCT, unclear if dilutional
or acute blood loss, he was guiaic positive on multiple
occasions.  He was continued on PPI and treated with IV blood
transfusions as needed.  He was also treated with Epogen per
renal recs.

Delta MS - He was noted to be less interactive, likely due to
sepsis.  Head CT only c/w atrophy and small vessel ischemia,
old.  He was also on sedating meds now but delta MS is likely
from toxic-metabolic as it did not resolve when these meds were
held.

DM - He was managed with an insulin drip.  Attempts to wean this
off by starting SC long acting insulin were not successful,
likely due to poor SC absorption.

FEN - He was maintained on tube feeds throughout his
hospitalization.
