History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is an 86M with PMH significant for h/o duodenal ulcer
s/p partial duodenectomy, who presents from [**Hospital 100**] Rehab after
melena noted on [**8-11**]. Denied CP, SOB, abd pain, N/V, though his
son had noted some increased confusion during the previous few
days. He was found to have a hct drop from baseline 29 to 19,
and was sent to the ED. EMS VS BP 110/60, HR 92, RR 18. In the
ED, initial VS were T: 99.4F, HR: 119, BP 108/39, RR 19, SaO2
100%. ECG demonstrated NSR at 96bpm, LAD, incomplete RBBB, poor
r-wave progression. A decision was made not to place NGT since
patient uncooperative, and due to concerns about aspiration. A
16ga and an 18ga PIVs were placed, and he was given 2U PRBC and
2L NS, and was given protonix 40mg IV. GI was consulted, and is
aware. Mr. [**Known lastname **] was also found to have a UTI, and was given
Levofloxacin 500mg IV. He was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for
monitoring.
.
Originally had GIB in [**8-17**] with black, tarry stools, dx'ed as
PUD. He had a hip replacement in [**11-17**], and was d/c'ed on
coumadin. Later that month, he re-presented to [**Hospital1 **] with bloody
stools, hypotensive, and anemic to hct 14.7. EGD demonstrated
bleeding duodenal ulcer, but epi was not attempted [**2-14**] inability
to visualize clot. He was taken for angio and embolization, with
subsequent rebleeding requiring ex lap, duodenotomy, oversewn
ulcer, j-tube placement and biopsy of liver mass. He was
continued on a proton pump inhibitor. He failed various swallow
evaluations and was fed through his J-tube. Course was
complicated by difficulty weaning from vent and MRSA PNA and
pseudomonas UTI and bacteremia. Also found to have superficial
femoral vein clots, and IVC filter was placed. Had subsequent
LGIB in [**2-18**], with colonoscopy revealing grade 1 internal
hemorrhoids, and a cecal popyp, which was cauterized. Course c/b
c. diff colitis, s/p flagyl and PO vanc treatment x total 28
days. Also with 06/06 admission for J-tube replacement, with
Klebsiella UTI sensitive only to Bactrim, Unasyn, Zosyn, and
carbapenems.
.
in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], initial BPs found to be SBP 80s-90s, HR 80s. Given
1L NS over 1 hour, which raised SBP to 100s-110s. UOP 80mL in
first hour. Repeat hct 19.1 -> 21.8 after 2U PRBC, started two
additional units PRBCs over two hours each. NGT placement was
attempted, but aborted after multiple unsuccessful attempts,
significant patient distress, and transient desats to 90%. Spoke
with GI, who plans to scope on [**8-14**] unless becomes unstable.

MR R foot:
1. Posterior calcaneal edema. Given the close proximity to the
soft tissue ulcer, findings are highly suspicious for
osteomyelitis. (it is not clear whether the cortical loss seen
on the xray is secondary to infection or post- surgical. The
marrow edema seen in the calcaneus likely reflects a combination
of osteomyelitis (closer to the ulcer) and surorunding reactive
edema, but the precise demarcation between these two areas
cannot be assessed by imaging.

2. Edema of the quadratus plantae muscle -- the ddx includes
both infeciton and reactive edema.

3. No bone or soft tissue abcess identified.
..
R foot XR:
1. Soft tissue deformity with subcutaneous emphysema and
corresponding bony destruction of the posterior right calcaneus
consistent with diagnosis of osteomyelitis.
2. Extensive [**Month/Day/Year 1106**] calcifications and diffuse osteopenia.


Brief Hospital Course:
1) Melena: EGD ([**8-14**]) showed 2 duodenal ulcers without visible
vessel, adherent clot or active bleeding. HCT has been stable
since 4 units total on admission.
Treated initially with protonix 40mg IV bid, transitioned to
lansoprazole 30 mg per J tube [**Hospital1 **], H.Pylori treatment with
amox/clairithromycin/PPI, amoxicillin was d/c'd due to zosyn
administration for UTI/osteo.

.
2) Hypotension: Was likely due to combination of GIB and sepsis
from UTI. Responded to IVF and antibiotics/blood. Remained
normotensive during rest of admission.
.
3) UTI: Urine Cx with Klebsiella (ESBL) sensitive only to
Bactrim, carbapenems, Zosyn, and Unasyn.
- Will treat with Zosyn 4.5mg IV q6h for 2 weeks
.
4) Right Heel ulcer: pressure ulcer of right heel necrotic with
evidence of underlying osteo on XR, on Vanco 1 gm IV q12 for
gram + coverage as well as zosyn. Consulted [**Hospital1 1106**] and seen by
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] is [**Last Name (STitle) 1106**] surgeon as well. Was discussed and felt
that only definitive treatment would be AKA, but given age and
comorbidities and risk of surgery sons opted for conservative
course of antibiotics and follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]. Patient
also will be seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] at [**Hospital 100**] Rehab to minitor his
wounds.
.
5) Dementia: Has agitation, likely with overlying delerium from
UTI
Resolved agitation/delirium after treatment of infections.
.
6) FEN: Resume tube feeds, monitor lytes and replete prn
.
7) Ppx: Pneumoboots for DVT ppx, PPI twice daily, BR
.
8) Access: PICC line
.
9) Full Code.
