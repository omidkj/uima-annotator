Service: SURGERY

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1384**]
Chief Complaint:
Transfr for worsening liver failure, increasing Cr.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Temporary dialysis catheter placement [**2128-4-9**] by IR


History of Present Illness:
This is a 61 yo M with history of diverticulitis s/p colectomy
and colostomy placement in [**2115**], cryptogenic cirrhosis without
past biopsy who presented to OSH on [**3-21**] with blood in his
colostomy bag and an expanding hematoma on his right flank, now
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for worsening liver failure and HRS. He has
had a long history of bleeding from his ostomy site (states this
has been an issue for years, unclear etiology but thought to be
more of an ostomy site problem than a colonic problem). However
he was recently admitted (around [**2128-3-7**]) to OSH for hematemasis;
subsequent EGD showed 2 cords of non-bleeding grade 1 varicies.

.
He was readmitted to OSH on [**3-21**], and was sent to the ICU for a
hct of 19. He was started on a PPI gtt, octreotide gtt and
nadolol and transfused with PRBC and FFP (over hospital course
recieved [**7-12**] PRBC and 8 FFP). Per the OSH records he does not
seem to have been hemodynamically unstable. His bleed was
thought to be lower GI (one description of "spurting" blood) and
eventually resolved on its own.
.
He was transferred to the medical floor. There he developed a
leukocytosis (13-15) and was started on levofloxacin. A
infectious work up was done, blood and urine Cx from [**3-26**] were
negative, A UA was reported at "slightly positive" (Nitrites and
1+ Leuk esterase) and CXR was done. Patient did not develop a
fever. However on the medical floor he began to develop
worsening liver failure. On admit his bili was 4.9 and increased
to 14.7 on [**3-29**]; INR increased to 3.2. His creatinine also
increased from 1.2 on [**3-26**] to 1.9 on day of transfer despide
fluid resuscitation. The decision was made to transfer him to
[**Hospital1 18**] for worsening liver failure, possible HRS and evaluation
for transplant.
.
His vitals at the time of transfer were HR 80, BP 98/65,
afebrile, 94%RA. BP at the OSH ranged from 84-110 / 48-72.
Regarding his hypotension, he notes his usual BP was 120/80 and
was on Diovan up through mid [**Month (only) 547**]. The first time his BP was
noted to be low was during his first admission in early [**Month (only) 547**],
and this continued through his second admission as well.
.
Currently, patient notes nausea with episode of vomiting earlier
today. Notes having mild nausea with dry heaves on several
mornings during his recent course. Endorses mild abdominal pain
particularly with movement, though finds this difficult to
distinguish from his back pain. Also with increasing abdominal
distension. Endorses at least 50 pound weight gain since
[**Month (only) 404**]. Massive edema in his legs has also developed. Endorses
poor mobility at home with requirement of cane or walker due to
leg edema.
.
ROS: Denies fever, chills, night sweats, headache, vision
changes, rhinorrhea, congestion, sore throat, cough, shortness
of breath, chest pain, diarrhea, constipation, dysuria,
hematuria. Endorses poor appetite over months. Endorses poor
sleep and notes PCP concerned re: depression. Also endorses
feeling that his thinking is not quite as sharp as usual.
