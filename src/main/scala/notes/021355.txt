Date of Birth:   [**2119-11-27**]       Sex:  F

Service:  Orthopaedics

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Ms. [**Known lastname 28458**] is a 34-year-old
female with a past medical history significant for asthma
who, on [**2154-11-5**], was involved in a motor vehicle collision
as a restrained passenger with a questionable loss of
consciousness.  There was a prolonged extrication.  The
patient was awake and alert at the scene and was transported
to [**Hospital6 256**] with a GCS of 15.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for asthma.

ALLERGIES:  Bactrim.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Occasional alcohol use.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On examination, she was awake, alert
and in some moderate distress with a GCS of 15.  Temperature
was within normal limits.  Heart rate was 100, blood pressure
was 140/palpable and oxygen saturation was 100%.  Evaluation
of her head revealed a left periorbital 4 cm puncture
laceration.  Pupils were equal, round and reactive to light
and accommodation.  Extraocular movements were intact.
Trachea was midline.  There was no jugular venous distention.
Lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally.  The chest was
stable without any fractures noted.  The heart was
tachycardiac with a regular rhythm.  The abdomen was soft,
non-tender and non-distended with no pain.  The pelvis was
stable.  The extremities revealed left hip pain with no
obvious deformities of the lower extremity.  Dorsalis pedis
and posterior tibial pulses were 2+ bilaterally.  Sensation
was intact.  There was no pain along the back, spine or neck.
No step-offs were noted.  Rectal tone was found to be within
normal limits.

LABORATORIES ON ADMISSION:  White count 12.9, hematocrit 33,
platelets 233,000.  INR 1.1.  BUN 14, creatinine .6, amylase
45.  Toxicology screen was negative.  Chest x-ray showed no
fractures, no pneumothorax and no hemothorax.  Pelvis x-ray
showed left superior inferior pubic ramus fractures.  Films
and CT of the head showed no fractures of the orbits.  There
was a facial laceration which was closed with 5-0 nylon in
the trauma bay.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Orthopaedics was consulted for the left
superior and inferior pubic ramus fractures.  Upon
examination of the patient in consultation with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 1022**],
there were several options given to the patient.  The patient
chose to have a screw placed in the right pubic ramus
fractures.  The CT of the abdomen and pelvis revealed left
inferior and superior pubic ramus fractures with mild
displacement, and a right inferior pubic ramus fracture with
a small left acetabular fracture and a left sacral fracture.
The patient did choose to have surgery and went to surgery on
[**2154-11-9**].  Details of that operative procedure can be found
in the Operative Report of that day.

The patient tolerated the procedure well.  She was seen by
physical therapy for full weight bearing on the right post
surgery and left touch-down weight bearing.  She was also
seen by the Ophthalmology Service for evaluation of her left
periorbital laceration which was healing well.  She had
orbital films done with no fractures found.  After being seen
by physical therapy and being cleared to go home, the patient
was thought to be ready for discharge.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:  Dilaudid 2-4 mg p.o. q4-6 hours
p.r.n., Lovenox 30 mg subcutaneously q12 weeks x3 weeks from
date of surgery (to be discontinued on [**2154-11-30**]), asthma
inhalers p.r.n.

She will have home medical therapy and will follow up with
Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 1022**] in approximately two weeks after discharge.
