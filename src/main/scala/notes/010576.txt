History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 106212**] is a 67 year-old gentleman with a history of HIV
(last CD4 273, VL<50), as well as a history of DM type 2, CAD
status post CABG and RCA stent, PVD, CRI, GERD, CHF, TIA and
history of large cell lymphoma s/p chemotherapy in [**2189**], who now
presents with worsening SOB and low-grade temperature. Mr.
[**Known lastname 106212**] was last admitted electively for the work-up of cognitive
decline on [**2199-11-8**]. Work-up revealed no change in brain MRI,
CSF with HIV viral load improved from prior but still high. The
working diagnosis was HIV encephalopathy. He was last seen in
clinic on [**2200-12-30**], at which time crixivan was increased and
Nevirapine was added for increased CSF penetration.

According to his wife, Mr. [**Known lastname 106212**] has had mild shortness of
breath for a number of weeks, with acute worsening this AM. No
history of cough, rhinorrea, or sore throat. + orthopnea with
stable use of 3 pillows over the past week, no peripheral edema.
Marginal improvement in SOB with escalating doses of Lasix to 40
mg PO BID. By the patient account, he had some left arm pain
yesterday, which was relieved with NTG X 1. This AM, he had some
dull aching left-sided chest pain, but did not take NTG. Per the
wife, he frequently complains of chest pain at home, without
recent acceleration of symptoms. + nausea over the past week, no
vomiting. No GI or GU complaints. He developed a low-grade fever
100.8 at home this AM, and they were advised by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] (ID)
to present to the ED for furter evaluation.

In the ED, vitals T 101.2, HR 95, regular, BP 167/67, RR 40, Sat
80% on room air. He was placed on 100%NRB, with saturation
98-100%. He received Lasix 40 mg IV x 1 as well as CTX 1 gm IV +
Vancomycin 1 gm IV X 1.

CD4 273, VL <50 on [**2199-12-30**]
Blood culture pending.
Cryptococcal antigen pending.

EKG: NSR, rate 78 bpm. Left axis deviation, normal intervals.
LVH by voltage criteria. Elevated J point V2-3 (not new), <1mm
ST depression I, II, aVL, V5-6, not new.

SINGLE VIEW CHEST, AP: There has been interval development of
bilateral patchy alveolar opacities and increased interstitial
opacities. Scarring within the left lung is unchanged. The
patient is status-post median sternotomy with cervical hardware
identified.
IMPRESSION: Interval development of diffuse, bilateral
interstitial alveolar opacities. These findings are consistent
with left ventricular heart failure and/or multifocal pneumonia.


Brief Hospital Course:
Complex patient with HIV, CAD s/p CABG and PTCA, diastolic CHF,
DM type 2, presenting with worsening SOB, low-grade temperature
and nausea.

1. Respiratory failure: multifactorial with CAP +/- aspiration
PNA and diastolic CHF contributing to presentation.
-- Pt was intubated on [**2200-2-3**] and extubated on [**2200-2-7**] then
reintubated on [**2200-2-8**] due to respiratory distress.  CXR at that
time demonstrated diffuse bilateral infiltrates with thick
consolidation of RUL consistent with either aspiration or
worsening lobar PNA.  CXR done 2 days later showed significant
clearing of infiltrates with persistent RUL consolidation, so it
was felt pt had aspiration pneumonitis.  complicating the issue,
he also had signs of volume overload and initially responded to
diuresis.  pulmonary hemorrhage basically excluded by CT chest
on [**2200-2-6**] NOT revealing pulmonary hemorrhage and anti-GBM and
ANCA were negative.
-- Patient was treated with 14 day course of levofloxacin for
presumed CAP.  He was also treated with 10 day course of
vancomycin and zosyn for presumed nosocomial/vent-assoc PNA
given diffuse b/l infiltrates found during hosp course after
intubation.
-- Multiple sputum Cx's and BAL x 2 never yielded a pathogen
[PCP (-) x 2, influenza (-)x2, [**Date Range **] (-), AFB (-), viral cultures
(-)x2].  Bronchoscopy x 2 revealed minimal secretions.  BCx
negative x12 sets (including fungal isolates).
-- LENIs were done x2 and no DVT found; bedside TTE on [**2200-2-8**]
showed no evidence of RV failure in setting of acute
decompensation
-- A PA catheter was placed on [**2-12**] to better evaluate volume
status given ? diastolic dysfnx.  PCWP was measured as 18-20,
with normal cardiac output and normal SVR.  The patient was felt
to be volume overloaded and attempts were made at diuresis,
initially with nesiritide but unsuccessful and low dose lasix
was administered on an as needed basis with good effect.
-- Tracheostomy performed at bedside on [**2-13**] due to failure to
wean.
-- He was weaned down to PSV 10/5 and was using Passy Muir valve
by time of discharge with periods of trach collar without
difficulty.  This can continued to be weaned at Rehab.
-- He continued to have thick tan secretions but no abx
indicated as pt afebrile.  Cultures remained negative and pt did
have intermitent low grade temps spikes attributed to
intermitent aspiration.

2. Renal Failure: likely ATN as pt was hypotensive for >20mins
on admission and muddy brown casts. however, labs were also c/w
pre-renal etiology.
-- as he had +urine eos and crystals, his HAART (indinavir) was
held x3 days, but no significant change occured and his ARF was
not felt to be secondary to med side effects
-- creatine improved and patient was able to have good post-ATN
diuresis with assistance of lasix.
-- prior to hospitalization, baseline creat was 1.1.  Despite
resolution of ATN, it appears that his new baseline is around
1.5 which he has been in the past.

3. Shock: hypotensive on admission, responded to dopamine and
weaned off within 24 hrs.  The e
