Bactroban Nasal

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2387**]
Chief Complaint:
shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac catheterization with drug eluting stent to the obtuse
marginal graft.


History of Present Illness:
Patient is an 85 yo m c CAD s/p CABG (3VD [**2162**]), HTN, HLD, DMII,
aortic aneursym s/o repair, pulmonary fibrosis, asbestosis,
right middle lobectomy, COPD/ asthma, on 2 L at home who
presented to [**Hospital1 1474**] Hosptital with 1 week of increased dyspnea
on exertion, shortness of breath, orthopnea, PND, increased LE
edema.  He has some DOE at home but is normally able to walk
around his house with his cane or walker without developing
significant shortness of breath. Last night he states he was
unable to get comfortable. He could not find a position where he
could catch his breath and his wife called an ambulance at 2 am.
He had some pleuritic chest pain associated with the cough and
deep inspiration. He denies dull chest pain or pressure,
palpitations, nausea, vomiting, constipation, diarrhea. He has
also had productive cough over last week as well with
grey-tinged, non-bloody sputum. He has also been feeling very
fatigued. He denies muscle weakness or myalgias.
.
On review of systems, black stools or red stools, palpitations,
syncope or presyncope.
.
At the OSH, his CXR showed bilateral congestion. CT was negative
for PE. His exam was significant for bibasilar crackles and left
sided wheezes. He was treated for CHF and COPD exacerbation with
solumedrol 125 mg iv q8h, lasix iv x2, azithromycin, nebulizer
treatments. He had previously been on prednisone 10 mg po daily
at home for his COPD. His ECG showed new LBBB, high grade av
nodal dissocation, with junctional rhythm in the 60s. His labs
showed, initial trop of 0.12, which increased to 2.12. He was
started on ACS protocol with aspirin 325 mg po daily, metoprolol
5 mg iv q4h. VS on transfer 99.3, SBPs in 120s, RR: 20-30s, P:
109, 99% on 4L NC.

Pertinent Results:
Echo: [**2179-2-22**]
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There is severe global
left ventricular hypokinesis with thinning/akinnesis of the
basal inferior wall (LVEF = 25 %). The left ventricle is
visually dyssnchronous. No masses or thrombi are seen in the
left ventricle. The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated
with moderate global free wall hypokinesis. The aortic arch is
mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Mild (1+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Normal left ventricular
cavity size with severe global hypokineiss and basal inferior
akinesis/thinning c/w multivessel CAD or other diffuse process.
Pulmonary artery hypertension. Right ventricular cavity
enlargement with free wall hypokinesis. Mild mitral
regurgitation. Mild aortic regurgitation.

CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS:
The left ventricular ejection fraction is <40%, a threshold for
which the patient may benefit from a beta blocker and an ACE
inhibitor or [**Last Name (un) **].
Based on [**2174**] AHA endocarditis prophylaxis recommendations, the
echo findings indicate prophylaxis is NOT recommended. Clinical
decisions regarding the need for prophylaxis should be based on
clinical and echocardiographic data.

CXR [**2179-2-21**]:
FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**3-2**], there is
increased prominence of the diffuse interstitial markings. This
suggests some elevated pulmonary venous pressure, superimposed
on severe chronic pulmonary disease. The possibility of
superimposed infection would have to be considered in the
appropriate clinical setting.

CXR [**2179-2-24**]:
FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**2-21**], there is little
overall
change. Again there is diffuse prominence of interstitial
markings that most likely reflect elevated pulmonary venous
pressure superimposed on severe chronic pulmonary disease. The
possibility of supervening pneumonia would have to be considered
in the appropriate clinical setting. Blunting of the
costophrenic angles is consistent with some pleural fluid with
compressive basilar atelectasis.
