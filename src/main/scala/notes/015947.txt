Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 783**]
Chief Complaint:
Endobronchial mass

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Excision/Destruction RUL endobronchial mass, removal of foreign
body.


History of Present Illness:
76M with hx of LUL resection for NSCLC 30 years ago who
presented to [**Hospital **] Hospital with massive hemoptysis on
[**2160-9-5**]. At that time, he was intubated for airway protection
and on bronchoscopy, he was found to have an obstruction lesion
of the right mainstem due to a RUL tumor. At that time, he was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2160-9-9**] for a rigid and flexible
bronchscopy where they found that the right mainstem was
approximately 80-90% obstructed by a tumor mass coming from the
right upper lobe. They found foreign bodies which appeared to be
suture material and perhaps a fingernail in that area which was
sent to pathology as well, prompting a possible diagnosis of
foreign body granuloma. They performed multiple biopsies of the
friable mass. Following the biopsies, the tumor was destroyed
with electrocautery and argon plasma coagulation. However, they
were not able to achieve patency of the right upper lobe
bronchus. The right mainstem was completely patent at the end of
the procedure. He was then sent to the SICU where he was
extubated without event. He had a video swallow which showed no
evidence of aspiration.
.
Of note, he originally presented to PCP with [**Name Initial (PRE) **] month of cough
and shortness of breath. He was treated emperically with abx
with no resolution of the mass on cxr, which prompted the
bronchoscopy at [**Location (un) **].
.
At baseline, he can walk 4 blocks without getting SOB.

CXR: No comparison exams at this facility. Satisfactorily
positioned ET tube in distal trachea 3 cm from carina. No
discrete bronchial lesion identified, although the right main
stem bronchus is not visualized. The superior mediastinum is
obscured with no discrete margination of its lateral borders,
and there is slight prominence of the upper lobe pulmonary
markings. No discrete lung mass and no vascular congestion or
consolidations. I doubt the presence of effusions, although the
right lateral CP angle is not imaged. Heart normal size. NG tube
looped in stomach. Slightly elevated left hemidiaphragm. No lung
nodules or bone destruction identified.

BRONCH RUL BX:
Right upper lobe mass, biopsy: Undifferentiated large cell
carcinoma.

CYTOLOGY RUL MASS:
POSITIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.
Consistent with poorly differentiated non-small cell carcinoma.

MRI HEAD:
No evidence of intracranial metastasis.

CT CHEST/ABD/PELVIS:
1. Appearance raising concern for the possibility of a pulmonary
embolus in a right lower lobe branch of the right pulmonary
artery, although indeterminate. this finding was discussed with
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] at 11 pm on the day of the study.
2. Mediastinal and right hilar lymphadenopathy.
3. Bibasilar mixed ground-glass and consolidative opacities,
which given their recent onset, are most suspicious for an
infection, inflammation, or in the appropriate clinical setting,
hemorrhage.
4. Marked scarring and emphysema in the right upper lobe.
5. Nonspecific pulmonary nodules, for which short-term followup
is recommended.
6. Several subcentimeter vague hypoattenuating foci in the liver
which are nonspecific. Metastatic disease cannot be excluded.
7. Large 3-4 cm nonspecific lesion in the spleen. To evaluate
the significance of this finding, further correlation with prior
studies could be most helpful.
8. A 13 mm lesion along the lower pole of the left kidney with
indeterminate characteristics and too small to characterize
here. It could be helpful to use an ultrasound to determine
whether this definitely represents a mildly dense cyst, if
clinically indicated.

CTA CHEST:
1. Filling defects within the arterial pulmonary vasculature
within the superior portion of the right lower lobe consistent
with pulmonary embolism. Etiology could include primary embolus
versus tumor thrombus.
2. Mixed ground glass and consolidative opacities seen by
bibasilarly. Unchanged compared to the previous study.
3. Unchanged emphysematous changes.
4. Unchanged right hilar mass.
5. Unchanged mediastinal lymphadenopathy.

BONE SCAN:
No definite evidence for osseous metastases.

LENIS:
No evidence of lower extremity DVT.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 76M with hx of LUL resection for NSCLC presents with
hemoptysis and found to have RUL mass with obstruction of right
mainstem.
.
# HEMOPTYSIS: He did not have any hemopytsis during his hospital
course here.
.
# NSCLC: s/p resection of LUL 30 years ago.  On this admission,
s/p rigid brochoscopy with laser ablation of RUL mass.
Pathology and cytology from biopsy shows undifferentiated large
cell carcinoma.  Heme/Onc was called for consultation.  He
received staging scans.  Head MRI was negative for mets.  Chest
CT showed mediastinal and right hilar LAD.  Abd CT showed 3-4cm
lesion in spleen and non-specific lesions in liver.  His bone
scan was negative.  He will get a PET scan for staging as an
outpatient.  He is scheduled for an outpatient follow up with
[**Hospital **] clinic at BIMDC on [**10-2**] with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1058**].  He
will also follow up with Interventional Pulmonology and CT
Surgery as an outpatient, appointments already scheduled.
.
# PULMONARY EMBOLISM:  He has a RLL PE by CTA.  His malignancy
probably put him at an increased risk for PE.  He will need to
be on Levonox 60mg [**Hospital1 **].  He need to follow up with his primary
care doctor [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] clinic and pulmonary clinic.
.
# POST-OBSTRUCTIVE PNA:  He has radiographic opacities on chest
CT which could be infectious or could be hemorrhage from RUL
ablation (reviewed with radiology).  He will finish his course
of antibiotics: levoquin and flagyl.  He will also need to
finish his steroid taper.  At discharge, he was able to ambulate
comfortably with 2LNC.  He will continue to use oxygen
supplement at home as needed.
.
# COPD: He should continue his albuterol and ipratroprium nebs,
and advair for long acting steroids.
.
# HTN: Continue outpt metoprolol.  Hctz was added on this
admission for further bp lowering.
