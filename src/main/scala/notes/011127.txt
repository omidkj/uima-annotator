relieve of symptoms but also significantly sedated.

[**2173-10-1**] ERCP: IMPRESSION:
1. Dilatation of the extra-hepatic biliary ducts. Per realtime
findings,
sludge was extracted from the biliary tree.
2. Placement of plastic common bile duct stent.
3. Normal pancreatic duct, at the level of the pancreas.
- Repeat ERCP in 8 weeks for stent removal.
.

[**2173-10-2**] Liver US
IMPRESSION:
1. Status post recent ERCP with gas in the common bile duct and
the
gallbladder. Although no definite shadowing stone is visualized,
presence of gas within the gallbladder and common bile ducts
makes complete evaluation of these structures limited.
2. Moderate dilatation of CBD. CBD stent is in place.
.
[**2173-10-6**] CXR: FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**10-5**],
the endotracheal tube has been removed. The jugular catheters
remain in place and the nasogastric tube has been removed.
Little change in the appearance of the heart and lungs, with
some continued bibasilar atelectatic change and possible left
pleural effusion.
.
[**2173-10-12**] EGD:
The biliary stent was identified, and bile was present in the
duodenum.
Erythema and congestion in the duodenal bulb compatible with
mild duodenitis.
Erythema and congestion in the antrum and pre-pyloric region
compatible with mild gastritis.
Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum.

Bedside swallow evaluation:
This swallowing pattern correlates to a Dysphagia Outcome
Severity Scale (DOSS) rating of level 5, mild dysphagia.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. PO intake of nectar thick liquids and Moist soft solids.
Patient may take sips of thin liquids as preferred/requested.

2. Pills crushed with puree.

3. Supervision to assist with feeding and monitor swallow
safety.

4. Recommend adding extra sauce, gravy, condiments to keep all
solid foods moist to ease mastication and transition.

5. Nutrition may be helpful in continuing to provide
high-calorie
supplements if patient's appetite continues to be poor.

6. Patient would benefit from further evaluation in a few days
at
rehab to ensure she is tolerating this diet and assess further
toleration of thin liquids.


Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 81 year-old female with a no significant past medical
hx who presented from an OSH s/p complicated hospital course due
to cholecystitis and ARF. She was transferred here for ERCP and
papilotomy.
.
# Cholecystitis - Pt underwent successful ERCP with biliary
stent placement right on admission [**10-1**]. Leukocytosis has since
resolved and pt was afebrile in the ICU. Liver and Gallbladder
US on [**2173-10-2**] revealed moderate dilation of the CBD with stent
in place. She completed a 10-day Vanco/Zosyn course per ERCP
recommendations.

#. Hct drop: During hospitalization she developed progressive
drop in Hct/Hgb with continued urethral bleed and black guaiac
positive stool. In addition, She had ecchymosis with SC soft
tissue small hematomas. She had multiple lines placed as well
with blood loss. Hemolysis was ruled out. She received a total
of 2 units RBCs. GI was consulted for slowly declining
hematocrit and reports of melena and she underwent EGD that only
showed gastritis and duodenitis. Her stool was observed to be
dark brown and guaiac positive but not true melena. She may have
a small bleeding source in the lower GI tract, but as her Hct
remained stable in the 27-30 range, colonoscopy was deferred to
the outpatient setting. Her urethral bleeding was thought to be
from repeated straight cathing, which was stopped, and this
bleeding subsided. She started getting Epogen at HD.  Patient's
HCT was noted to fluctuate with hemodialysis, and current
fluctuations likely represent cycles of
heme-dilution/concentration.

# ARF: Pt was followed by renal with HD. HD catheter placed at
OSH was not working well and she went for tunnelled HD line
placement in IR on [**10-8**]. She continued to be anuric and will
need HD as an outpatient. She was continued on phosphate
binders.  During hospitalization, pt was n
