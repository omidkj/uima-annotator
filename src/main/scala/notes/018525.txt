Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4765**]
Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea, Chest Pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac catheterization [**2127-12-4**]

History of Present Illness:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 71146**] is a 75 yo F with CAD s/p CABG (SVG->LAD,
SVG->OM, SVG->RCA) in [**2124**], hypertension, hyperlipidemia, aortic
stenosis, and cirrhosis secondary to autoimmune hepatitis who
presented to an OSH on [**12-1**] with acute onset chest pain and
progressive DOE, and was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] three days later
for cardiac catheterization.

The patient reported progressive worsening of DOE since her CABG
in [**2124**]. Her DOE has subacutely worsened over the past 3
months-- walking up 3 stairs and around house results in
dyspnea.  She denied any orthopnea, PND, syncope, or lower
extremity edema.  Her symptoms have progressed to the point
where she rarely leaves her home.  She denied associated chest
pain prior to the symptoms that led to her presentation to the
outside hospital.  Early in the morning of [**12-1**] she had sudden
onset SSCP radiating to L arm at rest, associated with feeling
'warm'. Denied n/v. No SOB at time due to being at rest. Her
anginal equivalent is atypical fleeting pain in all areas of her
chest, but she states the pain that led to her presentation was
more severe in nature. Chest pain lasted for 4 hours, subsided
without intervention. She called her cardiologist's office in
the morning and was advised by her cardiologist to go to the ED
for immediate evaluation.  She acknowledged being poorly
compliant with blood pressure medications claiming financial
hardship from medication prices.

She presented to [**Hospital 487**] Hospital for these symptoms on [**12-1**].
There, cardiac enzymes showed troponin of 0.02, CK of 51,
BUN/Cre was 17/0.8. She was given ASA 325 mg PO x1, metoprolol
150 mg PO, and 1 inch nitroglycerine paste, lovenox 80 mg SQ
[**Hospital1 **], and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for cardiac cath on [**12-4**].

In the cath lab, patient was noted to have severe AS (valve area
of 0.7) and arterial tracing with systolic blood pressures in
the 320s. Cardiac cath showed patent grafts unchanged from [**1-5**]
cath. She was started on a nitroglycerin gtt and transferred to
the CCU. In the CCU, patient denies chest pain. Her
nitroglycerin gtt was weaned, and she was started on a
nitroprusside gtt with good control of her SBPs in the 200s.

On review of systems, she denied any prior history of deep
venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of
surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools
or red stools. She denied recent fevers, chills or rigors. She
denied exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other review
of systems were negative.

STUDIES:
EKG ON ADMISSION: Rate 78, regular sinus rhythm, left axis
deviation. Prolonged PR interval (254ms), consistent with 1st
degree AV block (prolonged AV conduction). qrs widened in V1-V3,
RSR' in V1, deep S in V6, consistent with RBBB.  Given LAD, this
is indicative of bifascicular block with RBBB+LAFB.  R in aVL
20mm, meeting the criteria for LVH. Borderline left atrium
enlargement. QTc wnl (469). T wave inversion in I, AVL, V1-V3.
No significant ST changes.
.
CARDIAC CATH:  [**2127-12-4**]:
Hemodynamics: the aortic valve area was 0.68 cm2 with a 25mm Hg
peak to peak gradient. PA pressures were: (51/34, mean 42); PCWP
were: (mean 29, RA mean 16)
.
Coronary angiography: right dominant
LMCA: non selective injection. No apparent stenosis
LAD: 100% proximal occlusion
LCX: Patent to tortuous OMB
SVG-RCA: Patent to distal RCA.  70-80% stenosis of the origin
PDA
SVG-LAD: Patent to the LAD. Diffuse disease in the mid LAD<40%
SVG-OMB: occluded
.
There was marked systemic hypertension (up to 310mmHg) and a
pressure difference from the left arm to the right arm
consistent with subclavian stenosis.
.
Assessment and Recommendation:
1. three vessel coronary artery disease
2. Patent SVG to the LAD;  Patent SVG to the RCA
3. Occluded SVG to the OMB
4. Severe systemic hypertension
5. Critical aortic stenosis
6. CCU for IV nipride and BP control
7. Aortic valve replacement surgery
.
ECHO [**2127-12-5**]
The left atrium is moderately dilated. There is severe symmetric
left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size
is normal. Regional left ventricular wall
