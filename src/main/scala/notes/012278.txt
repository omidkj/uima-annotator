Imaging:
[**4-9**]: CXR:
IMPRESSION: Small left pleural effusion. Bibasilar atelectasis
with no
definite focal consolidation. Consider advancing endotracheal
tube 4 cm for optimal placement.


Brief Hospital Course:
65 yo F presents with tremors, weakness, falls and hypoxic
respiratory failure.

Hypercarbic and Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Likely secondary to
hypoventilation from opioids/benzodizapenes with possible
contribution from asthma/COPD exacerberation plus H. influenzae
CAP. Also concern for ingestion given difficult social situation
at home (husband with multiple myeloma, verbally abusive per PCP
[**Name Initial (PRE) 12883**]), h/o depression and positive amphetamines, although
patient adamantly denies any inappropriate ingestions.  She was
extubated [**4-12**], three days into admission, without difficulty.
Received vanc/zosyn in ED initially, however transitioned to
ceftriaxone and azithromycin and completed a seven day course.
She was placed on a fast steroid taper for possible asthma
exacerbation. She was noted to be volume overloaded secondary to
extensive fluids given during initial presentation. She was
diuresed and ultimately was able to oxgyenate on room air.
Ambulatory saturation prior to d/c was 92-93% RA.

Tremor: Noted after re-starting high dose Paxil at 40 mg daily.
Seen with activity and rest which is atypical in nature. This is
possibly secondar to high Paxil dose as this is a known to cause
tremor.  She was also noted to have a high TSH and as such, her
synthroid dose was increased though this is not very likely to
be the cause of her tremor.  Her tremor resolved prior to
discharge.  If it recurs, recommend consideration for a
neurology consultation.  She was discharged on 20 mg of paxil
daily.

Elevated LFTs: Unclear etiology, however normalized after acute
illness resolved.

Altered Mental Status: UTox screen positive for amphetamines and
opiates plus her home meds. Interestingly, patient denies taking
any illicit substances. Also, home meds plus acute renal failure
may have worsened mental status. Also, CAP may have contributed.
Mental status appropriate for latter part of hospitalization.
Decreased Paxil to 20 mg daily and Trazadone 50 mg [**Hospital1 **].

Acute Renal Failure: On admission: 1.5 with uncertain baseline.
Improved to 1.1. Possibly secondary to pre-renal etiology in
setting of acute illnes and improvement with IVFs.

Depression: Patient admits to having a lot of stress at home as
her husband is in treatment for MM. Decreased paxil and
trazadone as above. Stronly advised f/u with psychiatrist in the
outpatient. Patient states she has a psychiatrist referral from
her PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] has not called to make this appointment. She
declined any assistance with this.

Chronic Pain: Initially held home methadone, however restarted
this to full home dose of 10 TID.

Asthma: Completed prednisone taper as above plus
advair/singulair and albuterol prn.

Elevated troponin: Initially Trop T elevated to 0.09 with flat
CKs in setting of ARF. Patient ruled out for MI.

Incontinence: Patient states this is a new complaint. Patient
should follow up with urology in the outpatient.
