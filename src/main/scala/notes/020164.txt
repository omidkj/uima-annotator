CHEST (PA & LAT)

Reason: evaluate pleural effusions

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
65 year old man s/p MVR
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
evaluate pleural effusions
REASON FOR EXAMINATION: Follow up of patient after mitral valve
replacement.

PA and lateral upright chest radiograph compared to [**2177-4-19**].

The right internal jugular line tip terminates at the cavoatrial
junction. There is no pneumothorax or apical hematoma. The heart
size is markedly enlarged but stable. There is no change in the
mediastinal contours. The ICD-pacemaker terminating in the right
atrium and right ventricle are again noted .
Small amount of pleural effusion decreased compared to [**2177-4-18**].
The lungs are essentially clear.

IMPRESSION:

1) Cardiomegaly, no evidence of failure.

2) Decreased pleural effusion, small.

3) Standard position of right internal jugular line.

The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

INTERPRETATION:

Findings:

This study was compared to the prior study of [**2177-2-22**].


LEFT ATRIUM: Moderate LA enlargement.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Moderately dilated RA. A
catheter or pacing
wire is seen in the RA and extending into the RV.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thickness. Severely dilated LV
cavity. Severe
regional LV systolic dysfunction. No LV mass/thrombus. No
resting LVOT
gradient.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Mildly dilated RV cavity. Borderline normal RV
systolic
function.

AORTA: Moderately dilated aortic sinus. Normal aortic arch
diameter.

AORTIC VALVE: Normal aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS. Mild (1+)
AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Bioprosthetic mitral valve prosthesis (MVR). MVR
well seated,
with normal leaflet/disc motion and transvalvular gradients. No
MR. [Due to
acoustic shadowing, the severity of MR may be significantly
UNDERestimated.]

TRICUSPID VALVE: Mildly thickened tricuspid valve leaflets.
Moderate to severe
[3+] TR. Mild PA systolic hypertension.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflets
with
physiologic PR.

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

Conclusions:
The left and right atria are moderately dilated. Left
ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity is severely
dilated. There
is severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
thinning and
akinesis of septum, anterior and lateral walls, and hypokinesis
of the
remaining segments. No masses or thrombi are seen in the left
ventricle. The
right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated, and right
ventricular systolic
function is borderline normal. The aortic root is moderately
dilated athe
sinus level. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally
normal with
good leaflet excursion. There is no aortic valve stenosis. Mild
(1+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. A bioprosthetic mitral valve prosthesis
is present,
with normal leaflet motion and transvalvular gradients. No
mitral
regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity
of mitral
regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.] The
tricuspid valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid
regurgitation
is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no
pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Dilated left ventricle with severe systolic
dysfunction.
Borderline-mild right ventricular systolic dysfunction.
Normally-functioning
mitral valve bioprosthesis. Moderate-to-severe tricuspid
regurgitation. Mild
pulmonary hypertension.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2177-2-22**],
regurgitant
native mitral valve is no longer present, replaced by a
bioprosthesis. The
other findings are similar.
