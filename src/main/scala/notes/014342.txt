HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 44 year old
female with endstage liver disease secondary to alcoholic
cirrhosis and hepatitis B virus. The patient was on the
transplant list for liver transplantation. This was performed
[**2171-7-12**], which will be detailed below.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Pulmonary hypertension, peptic ulcer
disease, history of an appendectomy, history of a
tonsillectomy and as above.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Metoprolol 12.5 mg daily, Protonix
40 mg daily, Lasix 80 mg q.a.m. and Lasix 40 mg q.p.m.,
lactulose 30 cc q.i.d., spironolactone 50 mg p.o. daily,
sildenafil.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was brought to the operating
room on [**7-12**], and had a piggy back liver transplantation
performed. The malate score at transplantation was 23. The
patient was brought to the intensive care unit for her
critical care. Ultrasound on postoperative day 1 revealed no
intrahepatic diastolic flow. It was decided at this time to
take the patient back to the operating room [**7-14**], for
unkinking of the hepatic artery with a pexy. Liver biopsy was
also performed which showed hemorrhagic ischemic injury.
Prior to this and around this time, the patient had
persistently elevated pulmonary artery pressures and elevated
LFTs. There was no response to magic oxide or prostacycline.
On [**7-15**], the patient had an angiography performed which
revealed a lesion of the celiac trunk and this was stented. A
follow-up duplex showed good diastolic flow in the hepatic
artery. Due to some difficulty in the mental status, a head
CT was obtained and these results were negative on [**7-19**].
An echocardiogram was performed which revealed an ejection
fraction on [**7-23**], of 55%. Multiple cultures were sent
which revealed MRSA in the blood and gram negative rods in
the sputum. Since the LFTs began rising again, repeat
angiography revealed potential splenic resteal syndrome and
the splenic artery was coiled. This was done on [**7-25**].
Occasional desaturations led to obtaining VQ scans which were
low probability on [**7-26**]. Abdominal CT scan revealed
infarcted spleen on [**7-29**], including significant amount of
ascites. Multiple paracenteses were performed for therapeutic
purposes as ascites began to reaccumulate. The patient was
started on multiple antibiotics throughout the admission
including vancomycin, Zosyn, fluconazole. Immunosuppression
throughout the admission remained CellCept, appropriate Solu-
Medrol was on taper and FK506 dosed by level. The patient
remained stable until LFTs again began rising. An ERCP was
done on [**8-9**], which reveals slight anastomotic stricture
and a stent was placed here. Repeated hepatic ultrasounds
revealed lower indices in the liver each subsequent time. The
patient had a percutaneous tracheostomy done on [**8-13**]. On
[**8-15**], she had a significant increase in the LFTs to
4,522 which was AST and 2,070 which was ALT. Alkaline
phosphatase subsequently rose to 1,074. Bilirubin remained
elevated throughout for a greater portion of the admission in
the 30s and 40s range. INR on [**8-15**], was also 4.8 which
is drastically increased. Ultrasound done on [**7-15**],
revealed no intrahepatic arterial filling and very poor
portal venous flow. The patient's status significantly
deteriorated. At this point, the patient was receiving
multiple blood products including packed red cells and
platelets. The patient was started on CVB HTG ongoing fluid
and volume challenges. CVH was initially originated on [**8-9**]. However, due to significantly worsening status on [**7-16**],
including requiring oxygenation of 100% on the ventilator and
significantly increased blood pressure requirements, it was
decided in conjunction with the family after a lengthy
discussion that the patient should be made CMO. The patient
expired on [**8-16**].

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Expired.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:  Status post piggy back liver
transplantation.
