Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 106**]
Chief Complaint:
hypotension

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
85 yo male with a history of severe AS, 3VD CAD, CHF, s/p recent
admission to [**Hospital1 18**] ([**2113-1-11**] to [**2113-1-21**]) for acute on chronic
systolic CHF, with multiple recent admissions to [**Hospital1 1516**] for severe
AS and acute on chronic systolic CHF. He has been evaluated for
AVR/CABG, but his multiple recent admissions have delayed his
surgery.
.
Prior to this, the patient has had multiple hospitalisations at
[**Hospital1 **] in [**Month (only) **]-[**2112-12-29**]. He was admitted in [**Month (only) **] s/p LOC w/ left
orbital fracture thoguht to be secondary to AVNRT s/p ablation,
was found to have aortic stenosis and 3 vessel CAD on Cath. He
was d/ced with eval for surgery, but developed GI bleeding from
a gastric ulcer. Upon discharge he developed aCHF exacerbation,
and readmitted to [**Hospital1 18**] where his course was complicated by C.
diff colitis.
.
Patient had been at [**Location (un) 1121**] [**Hospital3 **] where he was
noted to
have low blood pressures(SBP 80s, baseline 90s), was agitated
and had loose stools for 3 days. Patient also reported some
difficulty breathing for the past well. He denied any fever,
cough, abdominal pain, chest pain, palpitations. Rehab
hospitalists and family requested transfer to [**Hospital1 18**], but he was
noted to be hypotensive to SBP 65, so transported to nearest ED
at [**Hospital3 7362**]. He was thought to be septic with leukocytosis
and left shift, with question of pneumonia on CXR, anasarca and
pleural effusions. Also noted to be in ARF this morning with
empty bladder, minimal urine output, difficulty with foley
catheterisation. His labs were: WBC 13 on presentation, 15.6
today with 24% bands, H/H 12.2/36.1, Platelets: 210. Chem7
notable for BUN 79, Creatinne 4.7 (4.1 on [**1-29**]), up from a
baseline of around 2.8. CK 1118->1557; Troponin 2.12->3.13; BNP
3211, up from a baseline of 1750. INR 3.5, lactate 1.7.
Urinalysis negative. Urine lytes: K: 59.7, Creatinine: 98.4, BUN
479. At [**Hospital3 **], he reports that he has not passed stool
or gas for the last 2 days, his urine output has dropped. Today,
he also had an episode of vomiting brown fluid.
.
He was given 3+L fluids, started on vasopressin, dopamine,
levophed, now weaned down to dopamine 10 and levophed 10, PO
Vanc, IV Vanc and IV Zosyn. Minutes prior to scheduled transfer
to [**Hospital1 18**], the patient developed chest pain and was given
sublingual nitroglycerin. However, he became hypotensive and
transfer was temporarily suspended. He was then placed on
dopamine 15 + levophed 28 mcg/kg/min and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].

PERTINENT STUDIES
ECHO [**2113-1-29**]
Conclusions
There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. Due to
suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality
cannot be fully excluded. There is moderate to severe global
left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF =25-30 %). The aortic valve
leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate to severe (3+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension.
IMPRESSION: Moderate to severe global hypokinesis. Moderate to
severe mitral regurgitation. Moderate pulmonary hypertension.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2113-1-14**],
LV function has decreased.
.
CXR [**2113-1-29**]
Although not labeled, this film is probably obtained supine. The
cardiac
silhouette is prominent, but similar to [**2113-1-11**]. There is hazy
opacity
diffusely through both lungs -- I suspect the presence of
bilateral layering effusions. There is probably underlying
collapse and/or consolidation, with suggestion of air
bronchograms in the right infrahilar region.
.
Clinical correlation to confirm that the film was obtained
supine is
recommended as it is difficult to assess the degree of aerated
lung on this film. If clinically indicated, an upright, lateral
and/or decubitus films could help to further assess the
underlying lung.

KUB [**2113-1-29**]


Brief Hospital Course:
85 yo male with history of critical AS, 3VD CAD, paroxysmal
atrial fibrillation on coumadin readmitted from rehab to OSH
with sepsis, colitis, acute on chronic renal failure,
exacerbation of congestive heart failure, and possible NSTEMI.
.
ACTIVE ISSUES
# Hypotension/Shock: Pt presented with shock, likely combined
septic and cardiogenic shock, with multisystem failure and
lactic acidosis.  The septic component is likely secondary to GI
source given the recent C.diff infection.  Surgery consult was
obtained shortly after admission to CCU.  Pt's abdominal exam
worsened rapidly with distension and rebound tenderness.  KUB
showed dilitation of bowel.  Given his unstable hemodynamics,
surgery was deferred.  Pt was treated with iv flagyl.  The
cardiogenic component of his shock is based on elevation of
troponin to 3 at OSH.  Given his known critical AS and three
vessel coronary artery disease (including left main), he has
little reserve for cardiac output.  It is also possible that the
GI symptoms were secondary to ischemic bowel in the setting of
NSTEMI.  Pt was transferred on pressors.  He was treated with
maximum dose of levophed, dopamine and vassopressin while he was
at CCU.  His blood pressure was maintained at 80s/40s with
reasonable mental status.
.
# End of life: [**Name (NI) 1094**] son came to the hospital and was notified of
the critical situation.  The decision was made to withdraw care
and focus on comfort measures.  Pressor was weaned, and morphine
gtt was started.  Chaplain was called and service w
