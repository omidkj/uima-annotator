History of Present Illness:
46 year old woman with EtOH/HCV cirrhosis who was recently
admitted on [**2176-6-4**] with coffee ground emesis and black colored
stools.
.
Today the patient called her PCP and reported 3 episodes of jet
black diarrhea, which was similar to her prior episode of UGIB.
She denied hematemesis, but reported diffuse abdominal pain and
poor po intake all weekend.  The patient denies the use of
NSAIDs, anti-coagulants, iron supplementation or pepto bismol.
She has no known history of bleeding disorders.

Of note since her last discharge [**2176-6-7**] she was having loose,
brown watery stools. Due to her chronic diarrhea, she is always
orthostatic.
.
In the ED the patient's vitals were as follows T 98.3 HR 86, BP
92/66 (BP tends to run chronically low) RR 20 O2sat 96% RA. Her
stool was grossly guaiac positive. She received 4l of IVF. Her
Hct was 41 (thought to be hemoconcentrated as her entire cell
line was up from baseline). She was seen by GI and transferred
to the unit for an EGD and overnight monitoring.
.
During her last admission, she required 9U PRBCs and aggressive
IVF resuscitation. An EGD was performed on [**2176-6-4**] which showed
grade I varices at the lower third of the esophagus, grade 1
esophagitis in the gastroesophageal junction, portal
gastropathy, duodenitis in the proximal bulb and large duodenal
varix.

TIPS
IMPRESSION:
1. Successful placement of a transjugular intrahepatic
portosystemic shunt using three 10-mm bare metallic Wallstents
extending from a right portal vein to the right hepatic vein.
2. Slightly unusual hepatic venous anatomy identified with two
separate right hepatic veins which were small in caliber.
3. Gradient between the portal vein and IVC pre-TIPS placement
was 13 mmHg. Post- TIPS placement the gradient was 9 mmHg.

Brief Hospital Course:
46 F with history of alcohol/hep C cirrhosis, portal
hypertension who was recently admitted with an UGIB found to
have a grade I varices, represents today with black tarry stools
similar to her prior presentation.
.
DDX includes from most likely to least likely bleeding varices
(given prior EGD), PUD, AVMs, Dieulafoy lesion, M-W tears
(unlikely given no hx of retching)
.
1) Upper GI bleed:
An EGD was performed on HD#1 but was aborted due to the fact
that the patient had consumed a [**Location (un) 6002**] while in the ED and was
vomiting during the procedure.  The patient was aggressively
suctioned, but there is a possibility that she may have
aspirated.  Serial hcts were done and remained >30. The patient
remained HD stable. She was kept on levo, octreotide and IV PPI.
 She had a 16 and 18 gauge IV.
.
An EGD was performed the following day with showed a duodenal
varix.  Due to the patient's hx of UGIB and the nature of the
varix, TIPs was performed on the same day.  There were no
complications.  Doppler U/S was performed the following day
which showed the following:
.
Patent TIPS with flow rates ranging from 84 to 151 cm/sec.
Patent and appropriate directional flow in the portal vein,
hepatic vein, hepatic artery.
.
She was transferred to the general medical wards following her
procedure on [**2176-6-20**], with hct (31->29-27->28).  On the morning
of discharge, pt was frustrated, and stated that she wanted to
leave AMA.  She was ultimately seen by interventional radiology,
who inspected the site of her TIPs procedure, and by the GI
service.  She was discharged home with instructions to check her
hct and follow-up with her PCP and the GI service within [**1-13**]
weeks.
.
.
2) Transient episode of hypoxia
-  During the EGD, she vomited up gastric contents and had a
transient episode of hypoxia. Her O2sats fell to the high 80s.
She was placed temporarily on 2L NC and her sats improved to the
high 90s. Throughout her course the patient had transient desats
to high 80s.  She reported being asymptomatic.  Repeat CXR
showed moderate right pleural effusion and a small left pleural
effusion.  Consolidation was also present at the bases c/w
atelectasis or aspiration.  Repeat CXR on [**6-20**] showed "Moderate
bilateral pleural effusions and pulmonary vascular congestion,
which developed between [**6-18**] and [**6-19**] have decreased
substantially, there is
no interstitial edema, and consolidation in the left lower lobe,
probably
atelectasis has improved."  She was discharged home without
further treatment, as she declined to go home with oxygen.
.
.
3) Thrombocytopenia:
On admission patient's plts were 119. This is around baseline.
Of note on last admission plts fell to 48K. This was attributed
to octreotide and chronic hypersplenism. Low platelets may also
be a reflection of liver disease and low thrombopoietin.
.
4) Cirrhotic liver disease
Patient reports that she drank for over 30 years. She also has a
history of hep C (VL 600-700,000 copies/mL detected.)  Her
coagulopathy (INR 1.8) [**1-11**] liver disease.
.
She is on nadolol, furosemide and spironolactone at home but
this has been held in the setting of her GIB.  Elevated LFTS [**1-11**]
to chronic liver disease. Will monitor. She has no localizing
abd pain on exam.
.
6) Neuropathy
Continue neurontin.
.
7) Hypothyroidism
Continue Levoxyl.
.
9.) FEN: NPO for EGD, following procedure gluten free diet given
celiac disease. Hyponatremia prob [**1-11**] to poor PO intake.
.
10.) Prophy: on PPI, pneumoboots, no SC heparin given GIB and
INR>1.8
.
11.) Code Status: full code
.
Pt was discharged home on [**2176-6-17**], with stable hct (28's).  She
continued to require O2 to maintain O2 sats in the 90s, however
she refused to take home O2, and denied any symptoms of SOB with
O2 sats in the 80s on RA.  She was instructed to follow-up with
the GI service and her primary care physician [**Name Initial (PRE) 176**] 2-4 weeks,
and specifically to have her hematocrit checked before following
up with her PCP.

Medications on Admission:
levothyroxine 50 mcg
