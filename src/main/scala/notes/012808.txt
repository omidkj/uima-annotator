Allergies:
No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2290**]
Chief Complaint:
Unresponsive, respiratory distress

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
The patient is a [**Age over 90 **] year old female with a history of dementia,
multiple ischemic strokes, hypertension, diabetes mellitus,
atrial fibrillation, and diastolic CHF who was found
unresponsive in bed at her nursing home.  She was not responsive
to voice and only minimally responsive to sternal rub.  She was
noted to be in respiratory distress with tachypnea and
desaturation on RA, and was placed on a NRB.  She was brought to
the [**Hospital1 18**] ED for further evaluation.  She has a documented
DNI/DNR order.
.
In the ED, initial vital signs were T 96.9, BP 110/73, HR 130,
RR 24, SpO2 100% on 15L NRB.  She had an unremarkable head CT
with only no acute process noted.  Portable CXR showed a LLL
opacity concerning for infection, and her WBC count was elevated
to 16.4 with 79.3% neutrophils and no bands.  UA showed WBC 13,
small leuk esterase, and no bacteria.  Her Troponin was slightly
elevated to 0.05, and EKG showed atrial fibrillation at 135 bpm
with left axis deviation and no acute ischemic changes.  Oral
secretions were cleared with suction.  She was given Vancomycin
1000 mg IV and Zosyn 4.5 grams IV.  She received a total of 700
ml IV fluids.  For her atrial fibrillation, she received a total
of Diltiazem 40 mg IV with good response in her heart rate and
stable blood pressure.  She was admitted to the ICU given her
continued oxygen requirement.  Vitals prior to transfer were T
afebrile, HR 103, BP 97/47, RR 27, SpO2 98% on 15L.
.
Once in the ICU, she remained unresponsive to voice and would
only withdraw from painful stimuli.  She was in mild respiratory
distress with tachypnea and appeared uncomfortable.  Her son was
[**Name (NI) 653**] and her code status was confirmed as DNR/DNI.  He will
be coming in to the ICU tomorrow.

place.  Soft, non-tender, non-distended.
GU: Foley draining clear yellow urine
Ext: Cool distal extremities. Radial pulses 1+, unable to
palpate pedal pulses. No lower extremity edema.  Toes somewhat

.
DISCHARGE PHYSICAL EXAM:
Afebrile BP 100s-110s/50-60s P 50s-80s RR 20 SpO2 96-100% RA
Gen: mostly nonverbal and unresponsive.  Usually with eyes open.
 Occasionally will turn to voice.  Otherwise, does not withdrawl
to pain and does not follow commands.
Remainder of exam is unchanged except heart rate was well
controlled at time of discharge.


Pertinent Results:
====================
Imaging:
====================
# CHEST (PORTABLE AP) ([**2166-8-22**] at 12:32 PM):
FINDINGS: A portable semi-upright view of the chest was
obtained. The patient is rotated and low lung volumes result in
bronchovascular crowding. Left lower lung consolidatoin may be a
combination of atelectasis and effusion, although infection
cannot be excluded. The heart is enlarged. Aortic knob
calcifications are seen. The right lung is clear without
pneumothorax or effusion. No acute osseous abnormality is
identified.
IMPRESSION: Left lower lung consolidation may be a combination
of telectasis and effusion, but infection cannot be excluded. PA
and lateral views may be helpful for further evaluation.
.
# CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST ([**2166-8-22**] at 12:38 PM):
FINDINGS: There is no acute intracranial hemorrhage, edema, mass
effect or major vascular territorial infarcts. Prominent
ventricles and sulci are compatible with moderate global
age-related volume loss. Hypoattenuation in the periventricular
and subcortical white matter is likely sequelae of chronic
microvascular ischemic disease. Bilateral basal ganglia
calcifications are noted. There is no shift of normally midline
structures. [**Doctor Last Name **]-white matter differentiation is preserved. No
acute osseous abnormality is identified. Mild mucosal thickening
is seen in the ethmoid air cells and sphenoid sinuses. The
mastoid air cells are clear.
IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial hemorrhage. Significant global
age related volume loss and chronic microvascular ischemic
disease change.
.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2166-8-26**]
FINDINGS: As compared to the previous examination, the extent of
the
pre-existing left pleural effusion has moderately increased. The
effusion now occupies approximately 50% of the left hemithorax.
No right pleural effusion.
There is mild cardiomegaly with signs of minimal overhydration.
No newly occurred focal parenchymal opacities. Extensive left
lower lobe
atelectasis.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient is a [**Age over 90 **] year old female with a history of dementia,
multiple ischemic strokes, hypertension, diabetes mellitus,
atrial fibrillation, and diastolic CHF who was found
unresponsive in bed and in respiratory distress at her nursing
home, likely due to a left lower lung pneumonia.
.
# Pneumonia, likely aspiration - She has a history of dementia
and dysphagia and was receiving tube feeds through a
percutaneous G tube. Given her acute presentation and history,
an aspiration event was presumed to be the likely cause of her
respiratory decompensation. She was started on Vancomycin and
Zosyn in the ED, and required supplemental oxygen with a 15L
NRB. She was continued on Vanc/Zosyn in the ICU.  She completed
an 8-day course of Vancomycin and Zosyn on [**2166-8-29**].
.
# Acute on chronic diastolic heart failure - On the medical
floor, she had an acute decompensation, with increased
respiratory distress, Afib with HR to 130's, and decreased
breath sounds.  She was presumed to be in acute diastolic heart
failure, and was treated with IV lasix, IV diltiazem, as well as
IV morphine and ativan for patient comfort given acute distress.
 With these interventions, pt's respiratory status stabilized.
Her HR improved significantly, and she was started on low dose
diltiazem to continue to help control her heart rate.  She was
continued on oral lasix.  Her volume status should be monitored
carefully.  Also, would recommend that her electrolytes and
creatinine are checked every few days and that her lasix be
decreased if her creatinine increases.
.
# Atrial Fibrillation, with RVR - She was in RVR several times
during her hospitalization and her nodal blockade was titrated.
Her heart rate was very well controlled on diltiazem and
metoprolol at the current doses (please see discharge medication
list).
.
# ? upper GI bleed - On [**8-28**] she was noted by n
