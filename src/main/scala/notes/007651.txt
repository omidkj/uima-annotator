History of Present Illness:
History of Present Illness: 75 yo male with PMH HTN, DM II, ETOH
abuse and ETOH cirrhosis, esophageal varices with GI bleed 20
yrs ago who presented with fall, while exiting a cab while
intoxicated. +head strike and +LOC. Unclear if he syncopized or
had mechanical fall. He has no recollection of the event and
does not recall event. Found by a neighbor lying in a pool of
blood. He was transported by EMS to ED. Pt reports that prior to
the fall he had noticed increased shortness of breath over the
course of the day, most evident with exertion such as
ambulating. Denies experiencing any chest pain, chest pressure
or palpitations. No other constitutional symptoms. He has not
noticed any BRBPR. Stools are black, though he is on iron
supplementation.
.
In the ED, initial vs were: T:96.8 P51 BP96/77 R12 O2 sat100RA.
Initial ETOH level was 122. Head CT showed a small 2mm L SDH and
nasal bone fx. Seen by neurosurg who did not feel that this
required emergent intervention. INR supratherapeutic at 3.4.
This was reversed with FFP and 10mg IV VitK. Started on protonix
gtt and octreotide gtt given guiac positive stool. Hepatology
was consulted and may plan for EGD in am. For access has 3 18G.
.
On the floor, pt reports headache and nausea. On arrival he
vomited about 400cc of coffee ground emesis containing bright
red blood clots.
.
Review of systems:
(+) Per HPI

gain. Denies headache, sinus tenderness, rhinorrhea or
congestion. Denies cough, or wheezing. Denies chest pain, chest
pressure, palpitations, or weakness. Denies nausea, vomiting,

III. Radiology

A. Head CT (Admission)
IMPRESSION:
1. Bilateral nasal bone fractures with buckling of nasal septum
consistent
with nasal septum fracture.
2. Left extra-axial hyperdensity likely represents a small
left-sided
subdural hematoma with minimal mass effect. No shift of normally
midline
structures.
3. Opacification of the ethmoid air cells as well as the
sphenoid sinus.
4. Opacification in the right external auditory canal may
represent cerumen;
however, correlate clinically for hemotympanum.

B. CT C-spine: No evidence of acute fractures. Multilevel
degenerative changes
noted.

C. CT Sinus/Mandible/Maxillofacial w/o contrast
1. Bilateral nasal bone fractures and fracture of nasal septum.
Non displaced
fracture of the anterior nasal spine.
2. Fluid/mucosal thickening within the bilateral ethmoid air
cells as well as
within the sphenoid sinuses.

D. CXR
AP PORTABLE CHEST, [**2153-12-6**]
Findings suggest mild volume overload and central vascular
congestion. No definite acute traumatic injury of the chest.

E. CT Head f/u
1. No significant short-term interval changes of the known
bilateral subdural
hemorrhage, small on the left and tiny on the right.
2. No new foci of intracranial hemorrhage. No evidence of
developing
hydrocephalus.
NOTE AT ATTENDING REVIEW: The hyperdensity in the temporal horns
could also
represent normal choroid plexus.

IV. Cardiology ECHO
The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right atrium is
markedly dilated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is moderate to severe
regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
inferolateral hypokinesis and akinesis of the distal LV segments
(multivessel CAD). The remaining segments contract normally
(LVEF = 30%). No masses or thrombi are seen in the left
ventricle. Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left
ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). There is no
ventricular septal defect. A supracristal/conoseptal ventricular
septal defect is identified. The right ventricular cavity is
dilated with depressed free wall contractility. There are three
aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately
thickened. There is mild aortic valve stenosis (valve area
1.2-1.9cm2). No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are moderately thickened. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is severe pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. The pulmonic valve leaflets are thickened. There
is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Moderate to severe regional left ventricular
systolic dysfunction, most c/w multivessel CAD. Severe pulmonary
hypertension with dilated and hypokinetic RV. Mild calcific
aortic stenosis.
