Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 618**]
Chief Complaint:
Confusion.

History of Present Illness:
The pt is a  88 y/o right handed woman with a history of
dementia, factor [**Doctor First Name 81**] def. and HTN who presented to [**Hospital1 18**] after
her daughter found her at home (assistant living) confused.
History obtained from daughter as the patient is agitated,
delirious.
.
Per her daughter, she states that was at her baseline yesterday
(baseline being, lives on her own, takes her pills on her own
with some assistance by her daughter. Gets [**Name2 (NI) 16429**] provided but
can boil an egg if needed. Cant use a microwave, gets confused.
No issues with dressing herself or ambulating on her own). Last
communicated with the patient around 8pm yesterday, today at 7
am she called her to remind her of her pills but got no answer.
She went to her place, found her sitting, neatly dressed, but
noticed to have a big bruise over the right forehead and did not
recognize her daughter. [**Name (NI) **] daughter was asking her questions
but she looked confused and was not able to responded
appropriately, meaning she was not able to answer her questions
with any degree
of specificity or appropriateness, but otherwise was not making
any type of paraphasic errors. The patient was then taken to her
room, she walked fine without trouble. But because of the
continued confusion her daughter brought her in to the [**Name (NI) **]
herself out of concern for something wrong. On the way over the
patient did complain of some nausea.
.
Here in the ED she was agitated and was given Zyprexa before
neurologic exam.
By the time of my encounter she was still agitated, restraints
were placed, and she was in a hard collar. I asked her some
simple questions but was only able to give me her name. She said
"I don't know" when asked where she was at. I told her she was
in the hospital and then she preseverated on Hospital. She would
frequently yell telling me to let her go, and that her ankle
hurt. She was not able to respond to any other questions for me.

LABS ON DISCHARGE:
------------------

.
IMAGING:
--------
CT HEAD [**2174-2-8**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. 4 mm of anterolisthesis of C4 on C5 and of C7 on T1 as well,
potentially
due to extensive degenerative changes.
2. Linear lucency through the base of an osteophyte at the level
of C6
potentially an old fracture, and non displaced frature line
through the left
pedicle of C7. No assocaited soft tissue swelling to suggest
acuity, but there
is no comparison study for full assessment. MRI may offer
additional detail if
desired if not CI.
3. No other evidence of acute fracture or subluxation.
.
CXR, XR KNEE, and XR PELVIS [**2174-2-8**]:
No acute processes including fractures.
.
CXR [**2174-2-9**]:
The patient is not well positioned, which limits evaluation.
Within this
limitation, the cardiac silhouette appears accentuated by
malpositioning.
There is increased opacification along the mediastinum which
appears
concerning for pulmonary overload pattern. Retrocardiac
atelectasis is noted.
Pleural effusion cannot be excluded on the left.
.
CT HEAD [**2174-2-9**]:
IMPRESSION:
Severely limited study due to motion and incomplete imaging, as
described above in the "Technique" section.

1. Within this limitation, the left temporal lobar subarachnoid
hemorrhage
appears unchanged.

2. New subarachnoid blood along the left parietal lobe may
represent
redistribution or new hemorrhage.
.
CT HEAD [**2174-2-10**]:
Compared to study on [**2174-2-8**], there is no significant
change in left temporal subarachnoid hemorrhage. No evidence of
new
hemorrhage. No significant mass effect or midline shift.
.
CXR [**2174-2-11**]:
Extensive opacification in both lungs, sparing the left mid and
lower lung
zone has worsened since [**2-9**]. First consideration would be
asymmetric
pulmonary edema, but there could be a substantial component of
pneumonia.
Moderate right and small left pleural effusions have increased.
Moderate-to-severe cardiomegaly is stable. No pneumothorax.
.
CXR [**2174-2-12**]:
As compared to the previous radiograph, the extensive bilateral
parenchymal opacities are virtually unchanged. There is slight
increase in
extent of a likely right pleural effusion. On the left, the
retrocardiac
atelectasis is constant. In addition to the pneumonia, signs of
mild fluid
overload are present. The appearance of the cardiac silhouette
is not
substantially changed.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient is an 88 yo woman h/o Factor [**Doctor First Name 81**] deficiency, HTN,
