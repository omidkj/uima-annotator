Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 613**]
Chief Complaint:
hypoxia, pulmonary HTN

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
right heart catheterization
Swan Ganz catheter placement


History of Present Illness:
59 yo F with PMH cirrhosis and tobacco admitted at OSH on [**6-25**]
with progressive dyspnea on exertion. She initially noticed
developing DOE on long walks about 1 month PTA, shortly after
quitting cigarettes. This progressed over the following weeks
until she became winded even while walking to the bathroom. She
also developed a mild cough productive of white frothy sputum as
well as a sensation of lightheadedness when extremely dyspneic.
She denies LOC, fevers, chills, sweats, chest pain, hemoptysis,
dyspnea at rest, orthopnea, platypnea, or PND.

On admission to OSH, she was afebrile with RR 26 and breathing
94% on room air. Inital ABG was notable for pH 7.58/pCO2
23.4/pO2 54/HCO3 21 on 2L of supplemental oxygen. She was
treated with albuterol and ipratropium nebs and 4L O2. Work-up
at the OSH included an elevated d-dimer, a V/Q scan that was low
probability for PE, a LE US negative for DVT, a CT-angiogram
that was negative for PE with incidental finding of RUL
infiltrates, and TTE which revealed severe pulmonary
hypertension with mild R heart dysfunction and TR. The patient
was started on levofloxacin and was weaned 3L supplemental
oxygen via NC. Follow up high-res chest CT showed progressive
ground glass infiltrates in upper lobes bilaterally. She reports
improvement of her dyspnea but continued cough with green sputum
production throughout the hospitalization. She was transferred
to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation and pulmonary consultation.

EKG [**2176-6-28**]
Sinus rhythm. Right axis deviation. Non-specific ST segment
depressions in
leads V5-V6 accompanied by low amplitude T waves in these leads.
T wave
inversions in leads III and aVF possibly related to right axis
deviation.

CARDIAC CATH [**2176-7-1**]
COMMENTS:
1. A swan was placed using the right internal jugular vein.
Resting hemodynamics revealed severely elevated right-sided
pressures with a RVSP of 90 mm Hg and PASP of 95 mm Hg with a
mean of 58 mmHg. There was also evidence of left ventricular
diastolic dysfunction with an elevated wedge pressure of 16 mm
Hg.
2. Coronary angiography was deferred.
3. Cardiac output is reduced at 3.4 l/min with an index of 1.8
l/min/m2.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Moderate systolic and diastolic ventricular dysfunction.
2. Severe primary pulmonary hypertension.
.
CT CHEST W/O CONTRAST  [**2176-7-3**]
IMPRESSION:
-No evidence of interstitial fibrosis.
-Ground-glass opacity in the upper lobes has improved from CXR
of four days ago, consistent with an acute process. Given the
rapid improvement, differential diagnoses include infection,
asymmetrical pulmonary edema, and, in the appropriate clinical
setting, pulmonary hemorrhage.
-Enlarged main pulmonary arteries in keeping with the patient's
known pulmonary hypertension.
-Coronary calcifications.
-Shrunken liver associated with mild splenomegaly.
.
ABDOMEN U.S. (COMPLETE STUDY)  [**2176-7-3**]
IMPRESSION: Normal abdominal ultrasound with normal liver
Doppler study.
.
ECHO [**2176-7-3**]
IMPRESSION: Small secundum atrial septal defect with
right-to-left flow at rest and with maneuvers. Right ventricular
cavity enlargement with severe free wall hypokinesis. Moderate
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. Normal left ventricular
cavity size and globa/regional systolic function.
CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS:
Based on [**2175**] AHA endocarditis prophylaxis recommendations, the
echo findings indicate prophylaxis is NOT recommended. Clinical
decisions regarding the need for prophylaxis should be based on
clinical and echocardiographic data.

Brief Hospital Course:
Pulmonary hypertension: Diagnosed by TTE at [**Hospital3 417**]
Hospital, where chest CT showed no evidence of PE, only mild
interstitial lung opacities R>L. Upon transfer to [**Hospital1 18**], she was
clinically stable, satting in the mid 90s% on 3-4L supplemental
O2 by nasal cannula. Pulmonology and hepatology were consulted.
Testing for secondary causes of pulmonary hypertension included
HIV, which was negative, scleroderma, which was weakly positive
(see below), pulmonary function tests for COPD, which did not
show any significant obstructive disease, and doppler abdominal
ultrasound, which showed normal portal venous flow, making
portopulmonary HTN unlikely. She underwent right heart
catheterization with Swan-Ganz cath placement on hospital day#3,
which confirmed elevated pulmonary artery pressures (PASP 98,
mean 58). Following this, she was transferred to the MICU with a
PA catheter for a monitored two-day sildenafil trial, which
showed minimal response in PAP but more impressive symptomatic
response in her exertional dyspnea and oxygen requirement.
Bubble echocardiagraphy demonstrated right to left interatrial
flow at rest and with maneuvers, c/w Eisenmanger's syndrome
through an apparent secundum ASD, thus implicating congenital
heart disease as the most likely etiology of her pulm HTN. After
transfer to the floor, she was weaned off supplemental O2 and
maintained O2 sats of 94-5% on room air at rest and 90-2% on
room air with ambulation. Given this improved performance, she
was discharged to home without supplemental oxygen for
outpatient follow-up at the [**Hospital1 18**] Pulmonary clinic.
.
Cirrhosis: She presented with elevated LFTs, coags, low albumin,
and a nodular li
