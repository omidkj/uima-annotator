History of Present Illness:
67 yo male with history of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, s/p left
ventricular septal myomectomy with MVR and AVR 2 years ago, CHF
with baseline NYHA class II-III, PAF, heart block pacer
dependent, HTN and obesity presents with 5 days of worsening
dyspnea on exertion. The patient reports he called his PCP 5
days ago with symptoms of lower extremity swelling. At that time
he was started on metolazone in addition to his home lasix dose
80mg [**Hospital1 **]. Over the course of the next 5 days he developed leg
cramps, fatigue, worsening dyspnea on exertion. He also reports
at this time cough productive of clear sputum, night sweats and
chills. He denies subjective fevers, lower extremity edema,
chest pain, worsening of baseline PND or orthopnea.
.
He was admitted to [**Hospital6 204**] initially for
management. There he was found to have acute renal failure with
BUN and Crn at 70 and 2.3. He was also found to have borderline
low blood pressure around 70/50. He received some fluids,
unclear amount, with improvement in blood pressure. The patient
was also found to have gained 20lbs in the last year, up from
254 in [**2113**] to 276 today.
.
On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
He denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other
review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,
ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

CXR [**11-21**]
Patient has had aortic and mitral valve replacements. Moderate
cardiomegaly
is stable, but there is no pulmonary vascular engorgement or
mild edema which
were present previously in the lungs are clear. No pleural
effusion or
pneumothorax. Transvenous right atrial and right ventricular
pacer leads
follow their expected courses. Rightward deviation of the
trachea just above
the thoracic inlet could be due to displacement by a tortuous
vessel or an
enlarged left thyroid lobe, but has not changed.

ECHO [**11-21**]
The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is moderate symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion
abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). There is no ventricular
septal defect. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. A
mechanical aortic valve prosthesis is present. The aortic valve
prosthesis appears well seated, with normal leaflet/disc motion
and transvalvular gradients. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is
seen. A mechanical mitral valve prosthesis is present. The
mitral prosthesis appears well seated, with normal leaflet/disc
motion and transvalvular gradients. The tricuspid valve leaflets
are mildly thickened. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2114-6-6**], no
change.


Brief Hospital Course:
67 yo male with history of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, s/p two
ETOH ablations, s/p left ventricular septal myomectomy with MVR
and AVR 2 years ago, CHF with baseline NYHA class II-III, PAF,
Mobitz II heart block, pacer dependent, HTN and obesity admitted
for over-diuresis and renal failure, improved with gentle fluid
repletion.
.
# Heart failure: The patient has a history of HOCM s/p
myomectomy, AI s/p AVR and MR s/p MVR, paced. The patient does
not report a history of dietary indiscretion, however seems like
prior to initiation of metolazone therapy he was having
worsening heart failure symptoms.  He had been started on
metolazone prior to this hospitalization which may have
contributed to his euvolemic-dry state.  LE edema was improved
from baseline.  PO fluids were encouraged during the admission.
TEE was performed which appeared unchanged from prior.  His
lasix, lisinopril and metolazone were held given his renal
failure but lasix and lisinopril were restarted on discharge.
His home doses of ASA, statin and metoprolol were continued
while in-patient.  His amiodarone was continued for management
of his afib and warfarin was temporarily held given
supratherapeutic INR, restarted when INR was in the therapeutic
range.  He will require INR check on d/c.
.
# ARF: His ARF was likely secondary to over diuresis with
metolazone and lasix.  Renal function improved with gentle
fluids and discontinuation of diuretics while in the hospital.
Lasix was re-started on discharge, however metolazone was not
restarted.  Pt will require lab f/u to monitor for improvement
of his renal function, may also require titration of diuretic
meds to manage HF while preventing recurrent ARF.
.
# Gout: Home colchicine was temporarily held given renal failure
but restarted on discharge.
.
# Spinal Stenosis: Not active this admission.
.
# PVD: No ulcers present currently, venous stasis changes
present.
