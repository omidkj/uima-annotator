History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 60 year old female with a history of HepC
cirrhosis, active HepC infection on ribaviron and interferon,
complicated by pancytopenia, has been on neupogen and promacta,
initially presented to the ED earlier today from the infusion
clinic for a scheduled transfusion with SOB.

On arrival to her infusion clinic appointment, she was notably
sob after walking from the parking garage to the
Infusion/pheresis unit. Her Resp rate was 30 with an o2 sat of
97% on room air.  Her bp was 78/38 on the right arm and 82/50
on the left. She apparently attributes this to taking her
lisinopril for the last 2 to 3 days, even though she was
explicitly instructed not to by her NP, [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 2808**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 805**], last
week as her blood pressures were low. She also reports the
development of pleuritic chest discomfort 4 days ago described
as sharp and made worse upon  deep inspiration.  A CXR was
ordered in clinic and showed new bilateral pleural effusions
L>R. She was sent over to the ED 98.2 80 26 o2 sat 97% bp
115/70.

On arrival to the ED, initial vitals were 98.2 93 103/57 18 99%
2L.  Initial vitals were notable for a Cr 2.8 up from baseline
.7, INR 2.0.  An ultrasound showed a moderately sized
pericardial effusion.  Cardiology was consulted, did a bedside
echo, showed no tampnnade phsyiology, a circumferential
effusion, and a pulsus of 8.  Trop .05.  With the pleuritic
chest pain, a D Dimer was checked which was > 6,000. She also
endorsed increased abdominal distension; a bedside ultrasound
showed no fluid to tap. While in the ED, her pressures started
to decrease to the 80s systolic. She received 2 L IVFs,
vancomycin and zosyn, and admitted to the MICU for hypotension.

On arrival to the MICU, patient is alert and comfortable with
SBPs in the 90s.  She does state that for the past 4 days, she
has also had diarrhea and has not been able to take POs.  She
also states she has taken advil sporadically over the last few
days to help her chest pain.

CXR:
1.  Bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right.
2.  Moderate-to-severe cardiomegaly.
3.  Peripheral parenchymal or pleural opacities bilaterally.
4.  These findings appear to be new at least since [**2150-9-18**] when the lung bases were visualized on the CT.  Further
evaluation with chest CT is recommended.
5.  Bilateral widening of the glenohumeral joint spaces may be
indicative of rotator cuff laxity.  Correlation with history and
physical examination is recommended.

ABDOMINAL ULTRASOUND:
1.  Coarsened echogenic liver compatible with cirrhosis.
2.  At least two and possibly three echogenic liver lesions are
new since
[**2152-4-27**].  These are concerning in a patient with
cirrhosis.  Further assessment with multi-phasic CT or MRI is
necessary once the patient's renal function improves.
3.  Small pockets of right upper and lower quadrant ascites.
4.  Portal and hepatic veins are patent.

TTE:
There is a small to moderate sized circumferential pericardial
effusion primarily lateral, inferolateral and inferior to the
left ventricle and anterior to the right atrium, with relatively
little effusion anterior to the right ventricle. There are no
echocardiographic signs of tamponade.

TTE:
The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). The right
ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with normal free wall
contractility. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally
normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or
aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened with probably mild mitral regurgitation (in limited
views). The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There
is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a
small to moderate sized pericardial effusion (upto 1.4 cm
diastolic width lateral to left ventricle, smaller elsewhere).
The effusion appears circumferential. There are no
echocardiographic signs of tamponade.

TTE:
Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global
systolic function are normal (LVEF 65%). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There is severe
mitral annular calcification. There is borderline pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is a small to moderate sized
pericardial effusion. The effusion appears circumferential.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.

Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed)
of [**2152-7-5**], the size of the effusion is similar. The heart
rate is reduced.

Right Upper Quadrant Ultrasound:
FINDINGS:  The liver is again noted to be coarsened and nodular
throughout consistent with the patient's known cirrhosis.  Two
small slightly hyperechoic lesions are again seen in the left
lobe of the liver essentially unchanged from the prior
ultrasound.  These lesions measure 1.1 to 1.2 cm in diameter
each.  No cystic component is identified in either of these
lesions. Additionally, a tiny hypoechoic lesion is also seen in
segment VI of the liver measuring 1.0 cm.  There is no cystic
component identified within this lesion. A small amount of
ascites is seen again in the right upper quadrant.  The portal
vein is patent with hepatopetal flow.  The gallbladder is normal
on limited views.  There is an enlarged periportal lymph node
measuring 3.5 x 1.4 cm.  No hydronephrosis is seen on limited
views of the right kidney.  No biliary dilatation is seen and
the common duct measures 0.7 cm.

IMPRESSION:  Nodular coarsened hepatic architecture consistent
with the patient's known cirrhosis.  Three small solid liver
lesions are identified. Additional characterization of these
lesions with CT or MRI is suggested when feasible.  There is no
evidence of an abscess.  Small amount of ascites again seen in
the right upper quadrant.

Brief Hospital Course:
60 year old female with hepatitis C cirrhosis, treatment
complicated by neutropenia on Neupogen presenting with SOB,
pleuritic chest pain, and hypotension, managed for shock and
ARDS, subsequently intubated, who was later transitioned to
comfort measures only by her family given her worsening clinical
picture and expired during this hospitalization on [**Last Name (LF) 2974**], [**7-7**], [**2152**] at 22:08.

# Hypotension/Shock: Patients SBPs in the 80s/90s on
presentation.  She received 2 L IVFs as well as one unit of
blood for a Hct 24, however reamined hypotensive.  She was
covered emperically for infectious etiologies with Vanc/Zosyn,
then changed to Vanc/cefepime.  Given pericardial effusion,
there was initial concern for impending tamponade, however, TTE
showed no tamponade physiology and pulsus was 8.  She was
subsequently intuabted for respiratory failure,  a CVL was
placed, and she was started on levophed, vasopressin, and
neosynephrine. It was also hypothesized that she may be in
decompensated cirrho
