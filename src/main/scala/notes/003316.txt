Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Bactrim Ds

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2297**]
Chief Complaint:
Hypotension, Unresponsiveness

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Endotracheal (through stoma) intubation

History of Present Illness:
85 year old man with a hx of laryngeal CA s/p laryngectomy
w/permanent tracheostomy p/w decreased responsiveness and
hypotension.  Pt. had been suffering through a cough and likely
COPD exacerbation with pneumonia based on pervious pulmonary
records.  According to family, patient was being suctioned when
suddenly became unresponsive, was found to be flaccid by EMS
with cold extremities.  Intubated through his stoma in ED with
resultant return of color and

In the ED, VS 99.6 115/46 59 100%RA 12, CXR demonstrated right
sided consolidation, received Vancomycin, Zosyn, rectal ASA.
EKG seen by cardiology with no plans for cath but would echo
instead, trop's negative.  Pt. was subsequently paralyzed with
vecuronium (for an unknown reason) with resultant hypotension to
60's, ETT repositioned.  Lactate initially at 4.0, down to 0.6
after fluids, initial ABG was 7.25/68/417/31 Fi02 100%.  Was
started on levophed with resultant increase in BP, given 1L NS
and weaned off prior to arrival to MICU.  IJ placed.  Also
received decadron 10mg IV x 1.
.
In MICU, pt. required boluses, though responsive initially to
command, nodding head to questions.  Started on vanc/zosyn,
given MDI's.  Placed patient again on levophed due to lower
blood pressures.
.
Of note, was febrile to 102.7 the week before this admission,
with green sputum and shortness of breath.  Was placed on
azithromycin and steroids by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 575**].
.

   GRAM STAIN (Final [**2198-5-23**]):
      >25 PMNs and <10 epithelial cells/100X field.
      4+   (>10 per 1000X FIELD):   GRAM NEGATIVE ROD(S).
      SMEAR REVIEWED; RESULTS CONFIRMED.

   RESPIRATORY CULTURE (Final [**2198-5-26**]):
      SPARSE GROWTH OROPHARYNGEAL FLORA.
      STAPH AUREUS COAG +.    SPARSE GROWTH.
         Staphylococcus species may develop resistance during
prolonged
         therapy with quinolones.   Therefore, isolates that are
initially
         susceptible may become resistant within three to four
days after
         initiation of therapy.  Testing of repeat isolates may
be
         warranted.
         Please contact the Microbiology Laboratory ([**7-/2495**])
immediately if
         sensitivity to clindamycin is required on this
patient's isolate.

IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. Mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with preserved global and regional biventricular
systolic function.
Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable
for review) of [**2191-5-26**], moderate pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension with mild right ventricular enlargement is now
identified. Regional left ventricular systolic function now
appears preserved
