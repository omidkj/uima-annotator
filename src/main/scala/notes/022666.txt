PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission the patient is generally
alert and oriented times three and in no apparent distress
but is obese.  The patient's head, eyes, ears, nose and
throat examination shows pupils equal, round and reactive to
light and accommodation.  Extraocular movements intact.
Mucosal membranes are supple and intact.  There is no
lymphadenopathy.  The patient's chest examination shows lungs
are clear to auscultation bilaterally with no wheezing,
crackles or rales.  The patient's cardiovascular examination
shows a heart with a regular rate and rhythm.  No murmurs,
gallops or rubs.  The patient's abdominal examination shows
the abdomen is soft, nontender, nondistended with no
organomegaly.  Bowel sounds are times four.  The patient is
obese and is status post panniculectomy.  The patient's
neurological examination shows cranial nerves 2 through 12
are intact.  The patient's lower extremity examination shows
she has severe lymphedema bilaterally.  There are signs of
previous ulceration on the plantar aspect of the right foot
that is now healed.  There are no signs of infection.  The
patient has a Charcot deformity mostly at the ankle and right
foot which is inverted.  Her dorsalis pedis and posterior
tibial pulses are nonpalpable, most likely secondary to
lymphedema.  Protected sensations are diminished.  There are
small keratosis on the lateral aspect around the lateral
malleolus due to pressure.  There is no sign of infection
currently in the foot.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  On hospital day one the patient was
admitted and was preoped accordingly for the pending
procedure.  The patient received CBC, Chem 7 studies as well
as chest x-ray and foot films.  The patient also had
antibiotic therapy initiated consisting of Vancomycin and
Levaquin.

On hospital day two, the patient had her Charcot foot
reconstruction with external fixation of the right foot.  The
corresponding operative note can be found within the
[**Hospital 228**] medical record.  The patient did however tolerate
the procedure and anesthesia well and without apparent
complications.  The patient following the procedure remained
intubated and was transferred to the SICU for the first
night.  The patient remained intubated simply because of the
length of the procedure and the patient did receive
approximately three liters of fluid to compensate for a large
volume loss during the procedure.  At the patient's postop
check she had no events or complications and her vital signs
were stable and intact.  The patient's lungs were clear to
auscultation bilaterally and her heart had a regular rate and
rhythm.  The patient's dressings were clean, dry and intact.
The patient had a JP drain intact and functioning properly.
External fixation device was also in place and stable.  The
foot was warm and had good coloration.

On hospital day three the patient was extubated and was doing
quite well postoperatively.  She was alert, oriented times
three at the time of her examination and denied any nausea,
vomiting, fevers, chills, diarrhea, as well as headache,
chest pain, shortness of breath or abdominal pain.  The
patient states that she felt well and denied any pain or
discomfort.  The patient's CBC and Chem 7 studies were stable
and within normal limits for this patient.  Her dressings
remained clean, dry and intact with some moderate strike
through.  Dressings were left in place.  Her neuromuscular
and vascular functions were intact and the external fixation
was firmly in place and stable.  Lungs were clear to
auscultation bilaterally and her heart had a regular rate and
rhythm.

The remainder of the [**Hospital 228**] hospital course remained
uneventful with her vital signs stable and intact.  The
patient was in no apparent distress.  Her CBC and Chem 7
studies well within normal ranges for this patient.  The
following exceptions to this hospital course should be noted.
On hospital day five, the patient was noted to be slightly
shortness of breath during the examination.  She also
appeared to have some mild distress with her breathing while
using her accessory muscles to assist.  The patient's lungs
had some slight rales detected bilaterally at the basal
levels.  There was no wheezing or crackles upon the lung
examination.  A chest x-ray was performed that showed some
lower lobe atelectasis bilaterally.  Also showed an
indication of mild congestive heart failure.  Since the
patient's surgical procedure she was being hydrated
aggressively because of her volume loss during the procedure.
It was felt that the patient had received enough fluid and
that this was causing her shortness of breath and mild
congestive heart failure per x-ray.  It was determined to
discontinue the patient's fluids and also to aggressively
continue incentive spirometry.

On hospital day four it is noted that the patient had
hematocrit drop to 24.8.  It was determined that this was due
to a combination of patient's chronic anemia and a large
volume loss during the procedure so the patient received a
transfusion of one unit of packed red blood cells which
resulted in her hematocrit bumping up to 26.6 the following
day.

On hospital day eight, it was noted that the lateral incision
site had a small area of necrosis which was felt to be
secondary to  skin tension during the closure procedure.  At
this time two of the sutures were removed to allow for some
extra skin relaxation.  The patient also had some mild serous
drainage coming from this opened area so the dressing changes
were changed to have 1/4 strength Betadine soaked gauze
packed into this open area.  In addition it was noted that
there were some mild serous drainage coming out of the medial
incision so as well 1/4 strength Betadine dressing was placed
on this wound as well.  In addition with the patient's mild
congestive heart failure by chest x-ray and shortness of
breath the patient was also diuresed with Lasix and continued
to draw for approximately one to two liters of fluid in
excess per day.  The patient's shortness of breath improved
with the removal of the fluid and the patient claimed that
she was feeling much better and breathing much easier.  The
patient was also removed from her breathing mask so that she
was sating at 97% on room air.  In addition would cultures
taken intraoperatively showed a resistant species of
Enterobacter cloacae so the patient's antibiotics were
chang
