HI[**Last Name (STitle) 2710**]OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  In brief, the patient is a
71-year-old male with a history of hypertension and
myocardial infarction, status post a catheterization on
[**2134-9-14**] showing three vessel disease insisted on going home
and has now had a two to three day history of complaint of
left sided chest pain and pressure unrelieved with sublingual
nitroglycerin.  The catheterization on [**2134-9-14**] revealed an
ejection fraction of approximately 60% with a proximal LAD,
100% occlusion with collaterals to the OM1, mid circumflex
lesion 100% occlusion, RCA proximal 99% stenosis and a mid
100% occlusion and OM1 70% stenosis.  The patient does not
complain of any diaphoresis, shortness of breath, paroxysmal
nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea or any pedal edema.  However, he
was readmitted on [**2134-9-23**] with these complaints and was
quickly referred to cardiac surgery and went to Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) 411**] for coronary artery revascularization.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Hypertension
2.  Hypercholesterolemia
3.  No diabetes

HOME MEDICATIONS:
1.  Monopril 40 mg po qd
2.  Aspirin 325 mg po qd
3.  Lipitor 10 mg po qd
4.  Toprol XL 25 mg po qd

ALLERGIES:  SULFA, HE GETS A RASH.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  He is a retired pharmaceutical researcher,
has a positive tobacco history of 2 packs per day x55 years
and drinks about two to four drinks a day.

FAMILY HISTORY:  There is a positive history of coronary
artery disease.

PHYSICAL EXAM:
VITAL SIGNS:  He was afebrile with stable vital signs.
HEART:  Regular rate and rhythm.
LUNGS:  Clear to auscultation.
ABDOMEN:  Soft, nontender, nondistended.
EXTREMITIES:  No cyanosis, clubbing or edema.

PERTINENT LABS:  White count 12.3, hematocrit 43.5.  INR of
1.0, potassium of 4.1.  BUN and creatinine of 21 and 0.8.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient underwent coronary artery
bypass graft x3 on [**2134-9-29**] by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **].  He
received a left internal mammary artery graft to the LAD,
saphenous vein graft to the OM and also a saphenous vein
graft to the PDA.  The patient tolerated the procedure well
without any complications.  He was extubated postoperatively
and was noted to be stable.

On postoperative day #1, he was transferred to the floor.
Physical therapy was consulted and the patient was noted to
be doing well with his ambulation.  On the evening of
postoperative day #1, the patient was noted to go into atrial
fibrillation.  He was started on an amiodarone drip and was
noted to convert on the morning of postoperative day #2 into
a sinus bradycardia rate of approximately 50 to 55 beats per
minute.  The patient's blood pressure remained stable and he
remained asymptomatic with this heart rate.  His pacing wires
were noted not to be function.  Thus, the patient could not
be paced at a higher rate.

On postoperative day #3, the patient continued to remain
stable.  He remained afebrile with heart rate of 51 and a
blood pressure of 120/65.  His Lopressor was held and the
patient was continued on po amiodarone.  His home dose of
Monopril 40 mg po qd was added.  His wires were removed.

On postoperative day #4, the patient was again noted to
return to atrial fibrillation in the morning.  He remained
rate controlled with his atrial fibrillation at approximately
90 to 100 beats per minute on the amiodarone.  Thus, Coumadin
was started and his Lopressor continued to be held due to his
likelihood of conversion back to sinus bradycardia.  Physical
therapy was able to walk the patient upstairs, thus making
him a level 5 and the patient was ready to be discharged on
hospital day #4 in stable condition in rate controlled atrial
fibrillation.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:

8.  Amiodarone 400 mg po qd x7 days, then 200 mg po qd
9.  Coumadin 2 mg po qd for a goal INR of 2.0

The patient will be discharged home with VNA for vital checks
and for INR checks.  The patient's INR will be followed by
his primary care physician, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) 35642**] [**Name (STitle) 35643**].
