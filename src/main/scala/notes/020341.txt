History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 4924**] is a [**Age over 90 **] year-old man with a history of coronary
arteryd disease, diabetes, hypertension, ischemic/radiation
proctitis and colon cancer who presents with a GIB.
.
Two recent admission. The first ([**3-17**] - [**3-25**]) was for a lower GI
bleed. A colonoscopy was notable for stigmata of a recent
internal hemorrhoid bleed with post radiation proctitis.
.
Then readmitted ([**4-5**] - [**4-11**]), this time with lower extremity
edema thought to be secondary to a CHF exacerbation. He was
diuresed 18 liters of fluid via Lasix gtt and Diuril with a dry
weight of 68.5kg achieved.
.
Since discharge from hospital has been relatively stable, though
has been less active (previously could do 30 minutes on the
treadmill daily, but now cannot do any). Over the last day he
reports approximately 10 hours of dark black stools. This has
not been associated with any abdominal pains, nausea/vomiting,
chest pains, shortness of breath, fevers/chills. He called PCP
and was advised to come to ED.
.
In the ED, initial vitals showed T 97.9, HR 70, BP 122/42, 100%
RA. His hematocrit was noted to be 22, down from mid 33 just
four days prior. One liter of NS was given and unit of blood was
hung. Protonix IV was also given.
.

.
EKG: Ventricular paced rhythm. Compared to the previous tracing
of [**2196-4-6**] no change.
.
CXR:  FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**4-8**], there is
no interval change. Again there is enlargement of the cardiac
silhouette without vascular congestion. Pacemaker device is
again seen in a patient with intact midline sutures and evidence
of previous CABG. No acute pneumonia.
IMPRESSION: No interval change


Brief Hospital Course:
[**Age over 90 **] y/o male with MMP including CAD, CHF with an EF of 40%, DM,
h/o colon cancer s/p resection & XRT with recent adm for BRBPR
found to have internal hemorrhoids & radiation proctitis now
presenting with black stools and a drop in hct.
.
#. GI bleed/Anemia: Pt presented with report of melena and hct
of 21 (baseline 30s)and INR of 2.  Pt was admitted to the MICU,
transfused with a total of 6upRBCs over the hospitalization and
was given po Vitamin K to reverse INR.  Pt was transferred to
the floor once hct was stabilized.  Given the history of melena,
this was thought more likely to be an UGIB. However, EGD was
unrevealing so a small bowel etiology was thought possible. Pt
underwent a bowel prep and had a capsule study performed on
[**2196-4-18**] to evaluate the entire GI tract. Pt's last melenotic
stool was on [**4-18**] and last tranfusion on [**4-17**].  Pt was monitored
in house for 3 additional days and hematocrit remained stable
off coumadin with an INR of 1.2. After discussion with patient &
family, decision was made to stop Coumadin given his recurrent
GI bleeds and there is no plan for ongoing anti-coagulation. Pt
was discharged on Protonix 40mg [**Hospital1 **]. Pt will be following up
with his PCP on [**4-22**] and will follow up with GI if capsule
study is positive.
.
#. CAD: Pt denied any symptoms throughout admission. There were
no events noted on telemetry, ventricular paced rhythm on EKGs.
Pt was continued on ACE-I, ASA 81mg & Carvedilol 3.125mg [**Hospital1 **].
.
#. Acute on chronic kidney disease: Baseline creatinine ranges
anywhere from 1.5-2.5 over the last month. BUN was noted to be
elevated on adm likely due to the GI bleed and it trended down
to baseline in house.  Creatinine stable at baseline of 1.4 and
pt was continued on his ACE Inhibitor.
.
#. Atrial fibrillation: Pt with a history of Atrial Fibrillation
and NSVT s/p pacemaker and was paced with a rate in the 70s.
All anti-hypertensives were held on admission and Carvedilol was
added back at a lower dose of 3.125mg [**Hospital1 **].  Pt was continued on
digoxin and ASA 81mg.  Coumadin was held of admission due to GIB
and after discussion with family/patient, decision was made to
stay off anti-coagulation indefinitely due to recurrent GI
bleeds.
.
#. Congestive heart failure: Pt remained dry to euvolemic
throughout admission off any diuretics.  He denied SOB, lungs
were clear on exam and maintained his sats well on RA.  SBP
remained in the 110s, pt was continued on Ace-i, lower dose
Carevdilol & Digoxin.  Pt was instructed to stop Bumex & HCTZ
and PCP was notified, pt may need these restarted in the future.
.
#. Diabetes: Pt was switched to glipizide 2.5mg daily in place
of glyburide due to baseline impaired renal clearance.
