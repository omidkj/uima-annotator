Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 784**] was admitted to the Thoracic surgery service on
[**2141-3-24**] for CHF exacerbation and atrial fibrillation with RVR.
.
She was diuresed with lasix, given lopressor IV, and started on
a diltiazem drip on day 1, which did not quiese her atrial
fibrillation. Day 2 she was bolused and started on amiodarone
drip; which unfortunately did not stop her afib with RVR
120's-140's. The patient remained hemodynamically stable. A TEE
was ordered and cardiology consult obtained on [**2141-3-27**]. CTA was
done on [**2141-3-26**] ruling out pulmonary embolism. Serial cardiac
enzymes were negative. The patient remained short of breath, and
given her uncontrolled afib; stayed in the ICU for observation
and management.
.
Patient was transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 196**] for further management of the
following:
.
#. Afib: Patient underwent TEE/cardioversion on [**3-29**]. She
remained in sinus rhythm subsequently and started amiodarone
400mg daily.  She was started on coumadin with heparin bridge.
Patient then switched to lovenox bridge (which was stopped after
hct drop-see below) and d/c'd on coumadin 2 mg daily.  Her
outpatient cardiologist was contact[**Name (NI) **].  [**Name2 (NI) **] has history of
stable aortic ulcer, per outpatient cardiologist.  She agrees
with anticoagulation given risk of embolic event and will follow
up her INR.  Coumadin may be stopped after 1 month, if there are
further concerns for bleeding.  Patient should be continued on
amiodarone 400mg daily for 1 month, then 200mg daily.
- INR check by VNA, goal 2-2.5. Followed by outpatient
cardiologist.
- Continue coumadin for at least 1month
- Amlodipine 400mg x1month, then 200mg daily
.
#. Pump: An echo done [**3-27**] showed EF 45% and on TEE [**3-30**] EF
was 55%.  She was diuresed as needed with iv lasix 20mg prn, and
continued on her ace-i and beta-blocker.  She was discharged
home on lasix 20mg po daily.
- Electrolyte check by VNA. Followed by outpatient cardiologist.
.
#. CAD: Known CABG and PCI in the past.  She was continued on
beta-blocker, ace-inhibitor, aspirin and statin.
.
#. UTI: Patient was treated w/ cefpodoxime for ecoli/klebsiella
UTI.
.
#. Anemia: Patient had a hct drop on [**3-31**], to 19.9.  Repeat hct
was 26.  Her lovenox was stopped.  She had several episodes of
small amount of hemoptysis.  A CXR was taken and was relatively
unchanged.  CT surgery evaluated patient and did not think that
her hemoptysis was significant.
- Hct check by VNA.
.
#. SCC: s/p lung resection. Continued nebs, guaifenisin.
