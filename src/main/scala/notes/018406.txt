Admission Date:  [**2107-10-22**]     Discharge Date:  [**2107-10-31**]

Date of Birth:   [**2056-5-8**]     Sex:  F

Service:  CCU

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Briefly, the patient is a
51-year-old woman with a history of atrial fibrillation,
rheumatic heart disease, and status post mitral valve
replacement who was transferred for [**Hospital3 934**] Hospital
after being resuscitated for a pulseless ventricular
fibrillation arrest that occurred during admission for
shortness of breath and abdominal discomfort.

In [**Month (only) 958**], the patient had a mitral valve replacement surgery
with a bileaflet mechanical valve with a postoperative course
significant for new onset atrial fibrillation and an ejection
fraction estimated between 35% to 50% (per report).

Since the time prior to admission, the patient experienced
the persistence of atrial fibrillation; and, of note, had 1/6
bottles positive for coagulase-negative Staphylococcus in
[**Month (only) 205**] (as per primary care physician).

Prior to admission, the patient complained of a 4-day history
of increased dyspnea on exertion, nausea, and vomiting.  A
transthoracic echocardiogram a her primary care physician's
office (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 99683**] revealed an ejection fraction of 10%.

The patient was then sent to [**Hospital3 934**] Hospital where
laboratories were remarkable for a theophylline level of 29
and an INR of 4.3.  The patient was also in atrial
fibrillation at this time.

The patient was then taken to Radiology for a right upper
quadrant ultrasound for her abdominal complaints on
presentation.  At 2:30 p.m. on [**2107-10-22**], the
technician noticed that she was blue, and the patient was in
pulseless ventricular fibrillation arrest.  A code was
called, and the patient was cardioverted with 300 joules and
loaded on 300 mg intravenously of amiodarone, intubated, and
was sent to the Intensive Care Unit.

The initial arterial blood gas in the Intensive Care Unit was
remarkable for a pH of 7.3, a PCO2 of 32, and a PO2 of 550.

This hospital course was also remarkable for an 8-beat run of
nonsustained ventricular tachycardia following the
ventricular fibrillation arrest, and the patient was also
successfully extubated.

The patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 188**].  Upon arrival to the Coronary Care Unit, the patient
was in atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response
of approximately 120 beats per minute to 130 beats per
minute.  The patient was given a total of 15 mg of Lopressor
intravenously with a decrease in heart rate between 100 beats
per minute to 110 beats per minute with a stable blood
pressure of 104/72.  The patient was given 25 mg of oral
Lopressor times two doses overnight with good rate control in
the 90s.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient has approximately a 15-pack-year
of smoking.  She reports occasional ethanol use.  She denies
any intravenous drug use.  The patient is married.  She works
in the processing department.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Physical examination
upon admission revealed vital signs with a temperature
of 98.5, heart rate was 110, blood pressure was 104/78,
respiratory was 18, oxygen saturation was 95% on 2 liters
nasal cannula.  Telemetry revealed atrial fibrillation.  In
general, the patient was resting comfortably, in no acute
distress.  Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat revealed
normocephalic and atraumatic.  Pupils were equal, round, and
reactive to light.  Extraocular muscles were intact.  Mucous
membranes were moist.  Neck was supple without
lymphadenopathy.  No jugular venous distention appreciated.
Cardiovascular examination revealed a mechanical first heart
sound, second heart sound, tachycardic, irregular rhythm.
Chest examination revealed crackles at the left lower base.
Good air entry.  No wheezes.  The abdomen was obese, soft,
mild diffuse tenderness.  Extremities revealed no clubbing,
no cyanosis, no edema.  No osseus nodes.  No [**Last Name (un) 1003**] lesions.
No splinter hemorrhages.  Neurologically, the patient was
alert and oriented times three; however, she had some memory
deficits.  Normal speech.  Moved all extremities.

PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:   Laboratories on
admission revealed sodium was 139, potassium was 3.9,
chloride was 105, bicarbonate was 20, blood urea nitrogen
was 27, creatinine was 2.1, blood glucose was 157.  White
blood cell count was 12.1, hematocrit was 34.2, platelets

remained below 0.4.

RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  Echocardiogram revealed atrial
fibrillation at a rate of 101, normal axis, normal intervals,
flattened T waves.  No ST changes.

A chest x-ray was remarkable for markedly enlarged heart,
prosthetic mitral valve.  No signs of failure.

A catheterization in [**2107-4-8**] revealed the following
pressures; right atrial pressure of 20, right ventricle
was 54/20, pulmonary artery pressure was 54/21, pulmonary
capillary wedge pressure was 25 with a V-wave of 45, cardiac
index of 3.1.  Also notable for a mitral valve gradient
of 12.8, mitral valve area of 1.4, ejection fraction of 45%.
No regional wall motion abnormalities.  Mitral regurgitation
was 3+, and coronary angiography was normal.

HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM:   The patient was then admitted to
the Coronary Care Unit for further observation, status post
pulseless ventricular fibrillation arrest; awaiting
implantable cardioverter-defibrillator placement.

1.  CARDIOVASCULAR:   (a) Rhythm/atrial fibrillation:  The
patient was found to be in atrial fibrillation upon admission
and was on an amiodarone drip and a Lopressor 50 mg p.o.
b.i.d.   Rate well controlled upon admission.  Initially, the
patient was switched from an amiodarone drip to oral
amiodarone and captopril was added at 6.25 mg p.o. t.i.d.

The patient remained in atrial fibrillation with good rate
control on amiodarone and Lopressor throughout the majority
of the hospital stay and was successfully cardioverted in the
Electrophysiology Laboratory on hospital day seven.  Upon
discharge, the patient's amiodarone and beta blocker were
discontinued; as per Electrophysiology requisition in
response to a decreased heart rate, status post
cardioversion, as well as interactions with implantable
cardioverter-defibrillator capturing.

(b)  Rhythm/ventricular fibrillation arrest:  The patient
with a low ejection fraction.  The patient was scheduled to
be awaiting implantable cardioverter-defibrillator placement
throughout the majority of the hospital stay.   Given a
questionable history of positive blood cultures in the past,
Infectious Disease was asked to consult to elucidate whether
or not the patient was at risk for endocarditis and other
risks associated with this history of bacteremia.

After an extensive Infectious Disease consultation, the
patient was cleared for implantable
cardioverter-defibrillator placement.

On hospital day seven, the patient received implantable
