History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 7203**] is a 63 year old male who is followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
in
behavioral neurology who was brought to the ED today from his
day
care center due to seizures. His history was obtained from the
ED
notes and EMS notes since the patient is now intubated and
sedated.  His neurologic history is significant for multiple
strokes with residual global aphasia and right hemiparesis since
[**2127**], SAH, s/p left MCA aneurysm clipping [**2143**], seizure d/o (off
AED's since [**8-23**]), and recent V-P shunt placement [**1-22**] for
hydrocephalus.

This AM, while at his adult day care center, he was noted to
have
right arm shaking.  According to witnesses, he appeared awake at
first.  After some time (unclear how long) the seizure
generalized to involve "the whole body".  This lasted for 3
minutes.  When EMS arrived, they found him disoriented
(?baseline
aphasia), but apparently awake and moving all extremities.  In
the ambulance, he had another witnessed seizure, was given
Valium
5mg x1, but "right sided shaking" continued so he was given
another 5mg Valium without resolution of seizure activity.

On arrival to the ER, he had right sided (arm and leg) rhythmic
shaking.  He was given ativan 2mg x2, paralyzed and intubated
(with Vec, Succ, etomidate, and fentanyl)for airway protection.
He was started on a propofol drip for sedation.  He was seen by
the neurology ED resident after he had been medicated and there
was no apparent seizure activity (though exam limited due to
medication administration).  He had another episode of right arm
shaking and received another 2mg Ativan in the ER.  He was
loaded
with dilantin 1g IV.  Just prior to transport to the ICU, he had
another episode of right arm shaking which resolved after a
bolus
of propofol was given.

He arrived in the ICU intubated and sedated on propofol.  He had
several occasional episodes of right arm and leg shaking
(rhythmic) which was sometimes associated with right facial
twitching as well.  There was no head or eye deviation
associated
with these movements.  The episodes were self limited lasting
about 15 seconds each. He was also noted to have frequent,
large,
loose bowel movements both in the ER and ICU.

As per his wife (who speaks limited English), he was in his USOH
today prior to going to his day care center.  They had recently
gone on a trip to El [**Country 19118**] together and returned home on
Saturday evening.  She says that he did not take any of his
medications while they were away.  Other than medication non-
compliance, he has been healthy, no recent fever, night sweats,
appetite change, N/V, diarrhea, change in urinary habits had
been
noted by the family.  She indicates that his last seizure was
about two years ago, but the details of the events are not
clear.
He was treated with phenobarbital until [**8-23**] when it was
discontinued due to ongoing cognitive problems and no recent
seizures.  At baseline, he is completely non-verbal, though
understands some simple words/directions, has a right HP, but is
able to walk and do basic ADLs such as feed and dress himself.
He
was initially evaluated by [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] in behavioral neurology for
behavioral and cognitive changes over the past year that were
associated with worsening gait.  Work up revealed hydrocephalus
and a VP shunt was placed [**2146-1-25**].  He was discharged home on
[**1-27**]
and has been doing well since.

Pertinent Results:
[**2146-3-23**] wbc=10.6 hct=45.3 plt=510
[**2146-3-22**] pt=15.2 inr=1.5  ptt=29.7

SUPINE PORTABLE VIEW OF THE ABDOMEN [**2146-3-22**]: There is interval
placement of an NG tube with its tip terminating in the distal
stomach. A VP shunt is again noted coursing across the left side
of the abdomen. Air filled nondilated loops of colon are seen.
There appears to be interval decrease in the amount of stool in
the rectum. The stomach is now decompressed.
IMPRESSION: Status post NG tube placement with interval
decompression of the stomach.

CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST [**2146-3-15**]: There is bibasilar
atelectasis with tiny bilateral pleural effusions. There is a 9
mm hypoattenuating lesion in the right lobe of the liver, as
well as a smaller one in the left lobe. These cannot be further
characterized on this study, but may represent cysts. The
spleen, pancreas, and adrenal glands are unremarkable. There are
multiple bilateral cystic lesions in the kidneys. The largest
measures 16 mm in diameter in the upper pole of the left kidney.
Some are hyperdense, and the presence of enhancement cannot be
excluded on this study. An ultrasound could be helpful for
further characterization if clinically indicated. There is no
mesenteric or retroperitoneal lymph adenopathy, or free air. No
free fluid is seen. There is an air fluid level in the stomach,
but the small bowel appears normal.
However, there is massive dilatation of the rectum and distal
sigmoid colon, with evidence of a distal fecal impaction. The
sigmoid colon is dilated up to 14 cm in diameter. More
proximally in the descending colon and proximal sigmoid is an
area of nondilatation. Apparent intraluminal filling defects
likely represent peristalsis. There is there is a mild focus of
dilatation at the splenic flexure. The cecum is prominent, up to
75 mm in diameter, which can be normal, however. There is no
bowel wall thickening or pneumatosis, and no evidence of
volvulus.
CT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST: The bladder is unremarkable.
The prostate has calcifications but is otherwise within normal
limits. There is no inguinal or pelvic lymphadenopathy. There is
massive dilatation of the rectum with fecal impaction as
described above.
BONE WINDOWS: There are no suspicious lytic or blastic lesions.
The osseous structures are unremarkable.
CT REFORMATS: The sagittal and coronal reconstructions are
helpful in evaluating the anatomy of the bowel. Value grade III.
IMPRESSION: 1. Massive dilatation of the rectum and distal
sigmoid colon, with distal fecal impaction, and possible
pseudo-obstruction. No evidence of volvulus.
2. Numerous bilateral renal cysts, some hyperdense.
3. Tiny bilateral effusions with a slight atelectasis.
4. Small hypoattenuating foci in the liver, which cannot be
further characterized on this study but may represent cysts. The
case was discussed with the house staff caring for the patient.
