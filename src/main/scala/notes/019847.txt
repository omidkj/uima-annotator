Brief Hospital Course:
Cardiac:
Rhythm: [**Month/Day/Year 6059**] on Holter: It was unclear whether [**Name (NI) 6059**] was
contributing to his SOB and lightheadedness. On admission, he
was in NSR without any complaints. His TSH was normal. EP study
was obtained to further evaluate his lightheadedness as well as
risk for sudden cardiac arrest. During the study, they were able
to induce VT/VF.  Post study, it was felt that ICD placement was
necessary.  A dual lead ICD was implanted.  He was given
prophylactic cephalexin.  During the hospital course, he was
continued on his metoprolol for rate control, and was monitored
on telemetry without any events once his BP was stable.  He did
not complain of any other symptoms post-procedure.
Pump: Based on Echo in [**5-7**], EF 40%. CXR on admission revealed
cephalization, but no signs of overt CHF. Follow up CXR did not
demonstrate any CHF.  He remained stable throughout admission.
Ischemia: no evidence of ischemia on EKG; He had no evidence of
ischemia on EKG and had two sets of negative cardiac enzymes. He
continued his home doses of ASA, metoprolol, Lipitor,
lisinopril, and plavix.
.
Respiratory: The patient was intubated during ICD placement.
Post procedure, they had difficulty weaning him from the
ventilator.  A CT of the chest did not show any acute processes
other than atelectasis.  It was thought likely due to poor
reserve secondary to COPD vs. atelectasis/plugging.  He was sent
to the CCU for post-procedure management due to intubation.  The
patient was usccessfully extubated in the CCU.  He did spike a
fever to 101 and was pan cultured on [**10-2**] prior to extubation.
He also had an elevated WBC to 15.  However, fearing aspiration
and ? pneumonia, He was started on Levaquin and Clindamycin.
Sputum/blood/ urine cultures were sent.  His prednisone was
continued and he was given Solumedrol.  He did not have any
fevers or localizing signs once extubated.  On discharge, he was
did not have any symptoms.  On discharge, he was given Levaquin
to complete a 7 day course for possible pneumonia pending return
of cultures.
.
HTN: During the procedure he briefly required neosynephrine, but
was able to be weaned successfully off pressors.  His BP then
remained stable for the duration of admission and he was
restarted on his outpatient regimen.
.
COPD: He had no active issues; however, the house staff did try
to encourage smoking cessation. He was treated with a nicotine
patch, and continued Advair, nebs, and prednisone.  Once he was
extubated, he was put on prednisone 30mg for a 6 day taper to
return him to his outpatient dose of Prednisone 10mg PO qDa
