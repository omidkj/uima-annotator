Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7333**]
Chief Complaint:
elective PVI complicated by pericardial tamponade

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Pulmonary Vein Isolation
Pericardial Drain Placement
Right and left heart catheterization
Transesophageal echocardiogram and cardioversion


History of Present Illness:
This is a 52 year old woman with history significant for
hypertrophic
cardiomyopathy, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation s/p multiple
prior
cardioversions, AF ablation in [**2170**], and PVI in [**2171-2-8**] who
is admitted to the CCU with pericardial tamponade status post
repeat pulmonary vein isolation procedure. Her most recent
cardioversion was in [**2172-3-10**] and at that time she
converted briefly to sinus rhythm and then went back into atrial
fibrillation and has remained in it since then, according to her
report. She experienced recurrent symptoms with fatigue and was
referred for redo pulmonary vein isolation procedure.
.
Patient presented for the procedure on the morning of admission
and underwent catheterization via the R femoral. Around 11:40
AM, she acutely dropped her blood pressures to systolics in the
40s. She was found to be in pericardial tamponade in the setting
of her supratherapeutic INR of 4.1. Bedside echo was performed
and showed a large anterior/apical pericardial effusion with RV
diastolic collapse c/w tamponade physiology. A large clot was
also visualized. The procedure was prematurely terminated, a
pericardial drain was placed. A Swan Ganz catheter was placed in
the left femoral vein for hemodynamic monitoring, and an
arterial line in the R femoral artery. She was hypotensive for
approximately 15 minutes, requiring neosynephrine briefly before
her pressures stabilized after drainage of 300 cc of blood. She
received 2 units of FFP. She was transferred to the CCU intubate
and sedated on propofol, hemodynamically stable off pressors,
for further management.
.
In the CCU, the patient was intubated and sedated and unable to
answer any questions.

Imaging:
SERIAL TTE
TTE [**6-17**]
Focused views during ablation procedure complicated by
tamponade.
There is a large pericardial effusion (2.2 cm). The effusion is
echo dense, consistent with blood, inflammation or other
cellular elements. The effusion is predominantly
anterior/apical. There is right ventricular diastolic collapse,
consistent with impaired fillling/tamponade physiology. There is
a catheter noted in the transatrial position, one in the
pericardial space and another in the IVC/RA.
After pericardial fluid drainage there is gradual improvement of
the size of the pericardial effusion (clip [**Clip Number (Radiology) **], measuring 1.1 cm)
and resolution of the tamponade physiology.
There was no significant resting LVOT gradient throughout the
procedure (patient has known hypertrophic cardiomyopathy).
.
TTE [**6-17**]: post-pericardiocenthesis
Focused views post pericardial drainage.
There is a small to moderate sized pericardial effusion. The
effusion is echo dense, consistent with blood, inflammation or
other cellular elements. There are no echocardiographic signs of
tamponade.
Compared with the post-pericardiocenthesis images of a few hours
ago, findings are similar.
.
TTE [**6-18**]
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
There is a small pericardial effusion. The effusion is echo
dense, consistent with blood, inflammation or other cellular
elements.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2172-6-17**],
the amount of pericardial fluid is slightly less. It has similar
appearance (echo dense) and distribution (over the RV free wall
and apex).
.
TTE [**6-19**]
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
There is a small pericardial effusion. The effusion is echo
dense, consistent with blood, inflammation or other cellular
elements. There are no echocardiographic signs of tamp
