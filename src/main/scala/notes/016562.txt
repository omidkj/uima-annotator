shortness of breath, nausea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
65 yo with ESRD on HD, COPD, and systolic dysfunction (EF 45%),
presenting with malaise, nausea, and shortness of breath
starting this afternoon after dialysis. Dialysis was uneventful,
and the patient went home. At around 3:30 p.m., he was sitting
in a chair when he became sweaty, nauseas, warm, short of
breath. No chest pain or pressure. He lay down for a couple of
hours, experiencing orthopnea. Then at around 5:30 p.m., he
asked his family to call 911 and take him to the hospital. He
had clear emesis once at home and once in he ER. He also noted a
cough. Of note, the patient ran out of one of his blood pressure
medications a few days ago, but he is not sure which one.
.
In the ED, initial vital signs were T 99.8 HR 106 BP 183/109 RR
40 Sat 78%/RA. EKG showed sinus 104, ST depressions in I, V5-6,
similar to prior. Labs were notable for WBC 13.2, trop 0.05,
lactate 3.9. CXR showed patchy basilar opacities, concerning for
pneumonia. CTA negative for dissection (done due to back pain).
The patient was given methylprednisolone 125 mg IV, vancomycin 1
gram IV, levofloxacin 750 mg IV, acetaminophen 1000 mg,
albuterol nebs x 1, ipratropium nebs x 1, morphine 4 mg IV, and
Zofran 4 mg IV. Vital signs on transfer Afebrile HR 104 BP
117/85 RR 28 Sat 94%/4L. Has PIV x 2.

IMAGING:
[**2161-7-9**] Portable CXR: Small patchy opacities in both lung
bases, worrisome for either foci of aspiration or possibly
multifocal pneumonia.
.
[**2161-7-9**] CTA Chest: Multifocal pneumonia.
.
[**2161-7-10**] Right Hand XR (AP/LAT/Oblique): Soft tissue swelling
about the small finger metacarpal. There is a transverse
fracture through the distal small finger metacarpal with volar
displacement, apex dorsal. No other fractures. No dislocation.
No degenerative or erosive changes.
.
[**2161-7-11**] Right Hand XR (AP/LAT/Oblique): Evaluation is limited
by an overlying cast. Again seen is the boxer's-type fracture of
the fifth metacarpal with radial and volar angulation of the
distal fracture fragment grossly unchanged compared to the prior
examination. No additional fracture is identified.

Brief Hospital Course:
65 year old man with ESRD on HD, COPD, systolic dysfunction,
presenting with shortness of breath and nausea and found to have
a multifocal pneumonia.
.
# SOB: Patient was ruled out for MI. He is euvolemic on exam w/o
suggestion of heart failure, and we reviewed the CT chest with
radiology and confirmed that there is no evidence of pulmonary
edema. No evidence of a COPD exacerbation. CXR was suggestive of
pneumonia (aspiration vs. multifocal). CTA was negative for PE
or dissection, and confirmed a multifocal pneumonia. He was
observed eating and does not appear to be aspirating. He was
initially treated for HCAP (considering his dialysis treatments)
with cefepime/vanc/levofloxacin, but the cefepime was
discontinued due to low suspicion for pseudomonas infection. He
makes very little urine and we therefore were unable to check a
urine legionella antigen. He will complete a 7-day course of
levofloxacin and vancomycin (dosed with HD) from [**Date range (1) 8264**]. He
was already given his dose of levofloxacin prior to discharge on
[**7-15**] and will need his last dose on [**7-16**]. He will receive his last
dose of vancomycin at dialysis on [**7-16**]. He remained afebrile with
normal WBC and clinical improvement. O2 sats are 88-96% on RA at
rest and with ambulation; 92-98% on 1L. He denies any SOB,
dizziness, or other symptoms with ambulation.
.
# COPD: PFTs on [**2161-2-23**] showed FVC 2.48, FEV1 1.10, FEV1/FVC 44.
The patient was treated with an inital dose of
methylprednisolone 125 mg IV in the ED, but was w/o wheezes on
exam and no suggetion of a COPD exacerbation. He was continued
on his home famotidine, advair, and spiriva, as well as
albuterol and ipratropium nebs prn. He was discharged on his
home regimen.
.
# Pulmonary nodules: On the CT chest there are a few prominent
mediastinal and right hilar nodes which do not meet criteria for
pathologic enlargement and may be reactive. These were noted on
prior imaging and are being followed by his outpatient
pulmonologist Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 437**]. He is scheduled for a repeat CT chest
in 8/[**2161**].
.
# Dizziness/hypotension: The day prior to discharge the patient
experienced dizziness and hypotension to the 90s during
dialysis. He reported a dry mouth and was found to be
orthostatic. His symptoms improved after a 500cc bolus of NS.
His symptoms were felt to be secondary to removal of too much
fluid in dia
