Chief Complaint:
abdominal pain, constipaption

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none


History of Present Illness:
69-yo-woman w/ MMP including recent emergent AAA repair,
presents today w/ abd pain. Of note, she sustained a C2 cervical
fracture in [**12-2**] after a mechanical fall, and trauma workup
revealed widened mediastinum on CXR that was dx by CT as a
ruptured infrarenal AAA. Her post-op course was complicated by
prolonged intubation, ischemic colitis, and UTI. She ultimately
had tracheostomy and was d/c to ventilator rehab, where she has
been alternating between CPAP and trach mask.
.
By report, she has been doing well at rehab until yesterday,
when she vomited. This was assoc w/ constipation, reportedly w/
no bowel movements over the past 5 days. There have been no
fevers, rigors, nausea, vomiting, melena, or hematochezia.
Today, KUB revealed significant amount of stool in the colon.
Enemas and dulcolax suppositories were given w/ minimal effect,
prompting referral to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED to rule out bowel
obstruction. She is unable to provide further details regarding
her pain, as she is non-verbal with her tracheostomy.
.
In the ED, abd CT showed no evidence of bowel obstruction or
bleeding. She was treated w/ ceftriaxone 1 gm IV for presumed
UTI. She had 3 BMs, resulting in resolution of her pain. She is
now admitted to the MICU for ongoing care.

Brief Hospital Course:
69-yo-woman w/ recent emergent AAA repair, DM 2, COPD, HTN,
tracheostomy, referred from ventilator rehab w/ constipation and
vomiting. Her ICU course is as follows:
.
# Abd pain/Constipation: Resolved after aggressive bowel regimen
and multiple bowel movements. Most likely [**12-28**] inactivity at
rehab, w/ contribution from ileus after recent surgery and
colitis. This likely was the cause of her nausea and vomiting.
There is no evidence of infxn. Abd CT shows no evidence of bowel
inflammation or obstruction. Her pain and nausea have resolved
completely after having BMs in the ED. C diff toxin pending at
discharge.  She was discharged on and aggressive bowel regimen
w/ colace, senna, lactulose.
.
# UTI- UCx (+)Proteus. Sensitivities as noted in lab data. Given
allergies to cephalosporins (although she denies rash, fever,
anaphylaxis, but reports feeling "jittery" after), plan to treat
w/Zosyn for total 7 day course for complicated UTI. At
discharge, she will have 5 more days.
.
# COPD: controlled w/outpatient flovent, albuterol, and
atrovent.
.
# Ventilator dependence: likely from combination of muscle
weakness, poor nutrition, and edema after prolonged ICU stay.
She is now alternating between trach mask and pressure support.
Appears comfortable on PS 10/5, w/ no hypoxia. She continued PS
[**8-29**] overnight and switched to trach mask during the day.
.
# HTN: controlled w/ metoprolol, lasix. Will continue.
.
# DM type 2: controlled w/ insulin at rehab.  She continued
glargine insulin 16 units qhs  and was covered w/ HISS
.
# Anxiety: continue celexa 20mg daily.
.
# FEN: NPO for now, and she started tube feeds
.
# PPx: heparin sc, famotidine, bowel regimen.
.
# Access: PIVs
.
# FULL CODE:  presumed full
