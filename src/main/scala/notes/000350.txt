Fevers

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 3060**] is a 55 year old male with hypertension, type II
diabetes, alcohol abuse, ESLD s/p orthotopic liver transplant in
[**6-/2137**], and severe motor vehicle accident with cervical spinal
fracture and subsequent tracheostomy and PEG tube placement in
[**8-/2145**] who was admitted to [**Hospital3 417**] Hospital from [**Hospital1 15454**] Rehabilitation Facility on [**2145-11-21**] for evaluation
of fevers. History is taking exclusively per notes. Per notes,
he spiked a fever to 104.5 degrees on the day of presentation
and was initially tachycardic and hypotensive and was initially
started on doripenem. Upon arrival to the emergency room at OSH,
he was no longer hypotensive but was persistently tachycardic.
In the emergency room his initial vitals were T: 103.8, HR 127
RR: 20 BP: 113/69 O2: 100% on ventilator. Initial WBC count was
7.3, Hct 25, creatinine 1.85, AST of 61. UA with 10-20 RBCs, [**3-10**]
WBCs. He received IVF and was admitted to the medical ICU. While
in the ICU it appears that he had a broad infectious workup.
Initial blood and urine cultures were negative. He was c. diff
negative. Sinus cultures from [**2145-11-21**] and endotracheal washings
from [**11-24**] grew acinetobacter sensitive to tobramycin, amkacin
and bactrim and he was started on amikacin from [**2145-11-21**] and
received this until [**2145-11-30**]. G-tube cultures [**2145-11-25**] with
enterobacter, enterococcus and mixed gram negative rods. He had
a non-contrast head CT which showed sinus disease but was
otherwise negative. CT of the abdomen without contrast did not
show evidence of abscess. CT chest showed a possible hazy right
sided infiltrate. Gallium scan showed uptake in areas of known
fractures and in the tracheostomy and PEG tube sites. He
continued to spike fevers as high as 106 degrees despite broad
spectrum antibiotics. He was also persistently tachycardic as
high as the 170s which they were treating with metoprolol. He
received amikacin as above, with a short period of levofloxacin
and micafungin early in his hospitalization. All antibiotics it
appears were discontinued on [**11-30**] after no fever source was
identified but he continued to spike fevers and was started on
vancomycin and cefepime on [**12-1**]. Final blood cultures from
[**11-30**] are now 4/4 bottles with gram negative rods, not yet
speciated.
Was transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] for further w/u and management

Past Medical History:

biopsy in [**9-14**] which showed early chronic rejection
Alcohol Abuse with relapse in [**2141**]. History of DTs in the past

Pancytopenia following liver transplant thought to be secondary
to immunosuppressive medications

C5-T2 posterior cervical depression fusion, left mandibular

right clavicular fracture, mediastinal hematoma, small
pericardial effusion, asysolic arrest for 5 minutes)

cxr [**12-14**]
In comparison with the study of [**12-12**], there has been decrease in

lung volumes. Some prominence of ill-defined pulmonary vessels
persists,suggesting continued pulmonary vascular congestion.
Poor definition of the left hemidiaphragm could reflect
atelectasis and small pleural effusion. No evidence of acute
focal pneumonia.
.
[**12-7**] CT chest
IMPRESSION:
1. Right upper lobe collapse due to obstruction of the right
upper lobe bronchus with secretions; nonobstructive left lower
lobe collapse.
2. Bilateral nonhemorrhagic pleural effusions, more marked on
the right with dependent right lung base atelectasis.
3. Small pericardial effusion.
4. Aortic annulus, aortic valve, and coronary artery
calcifications.
5. Multiple old fractures and fixation hardware in the
ervicothoracic spine from previous trauma.
.
.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2145-12-1**] 7:19 PM
IMPRESSION: Perihilar opacities, raising question of early CHF.
Multiple rib fractures and right clavicle fracture. No
pneumothorax detected. Patchy opacity at the left base, question
atelectasis versus early infiltrate.

IMPRESSION:
Somewhat limited exam, but no findings to confirm the presence
of
osteomyelitis
.
CT ABDOMEN W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2145-12-2**] 2:44 AM
IMPRESSION:
1. No acute pathology is identified in the abdomen and pelvis to
explain the patient's symptoms. No abscess cavity is identified.

2. Mild bibasilar atelectasis.
3. Unchanged calcified hepatic lesion in the interlobar fissure.

Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion
abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. No masses or vegetations are seen
on the aortic valve, but cannot be fully excluded due to
suboptimal image quality. There is no aortic valve stenosis. The
mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. No masses or
vegetations are seen on the mitral valve, but cannot be fully
excluded due to suboptimal image quality. Trivial mitral
regurgitation is seen. No masses or vegetations are seen on the
tricuspid valve, but cannot be fully excluded due to suboptimal
image quality. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure
is normal. There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. No vegetations found.
Normal overall left ventricular systolic function. If clinically
suggested, the absence of a vegetation by 2D echocardiography
does not exclude endocarditis.
Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable
for review) of [**2137-5-21**], there is no significant change
