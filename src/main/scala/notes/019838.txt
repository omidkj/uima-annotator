Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2698**]
Chief Complaint:
shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Aortic Balloon Valvuloplasty


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 9035**] is an 80 year old male with a history of CAD s/p 5
vessel CABG and aortic stenosis (s/p dilation x 2 [**12-30**], [**12-29**])
who presents with worsening dyspnea. His shortness of breath has
gotten worse slowly over the course of two months. He now
becomes dypneic when supine in bed. He endorses PND and
orthopnea, using [**2-20**] pillows to sleep at night. However, most
nights he ends up sleeping flat, very uncomfortably. He has not
had chest pain, fevers or chills. He has a nonproductive cough
that has persisted over the same time period. After the
valvuloplasty in [**12/2173**], he was able to walk for 15 mintues
without stopping. He has not noticed swelling in his legs or
ankles.

On admission, vitals were notable for a HR 89, R18, BP 96/55,
100% 3lnc. ACS was ruled out as the etiology of dyspnea and pt
improved with diuresis. He underwent an uncomplicated
valvoplasty today. During procedure, PAWP was elevated to 35 w/
a [**MD Number(3) 41999**]/47. He is transferred to the CCU for further
monitoring and diuresis. On arrival, patient only notes pain at
sheath site. He denies SOB, CP, fatigue, orthopnea,or weakness.

Cardiac Cath with valvoplasty: [**2174-8-2**]:
Interventional details	
The indication for the procedure was refractory congestive heart
failure due to severe aortic stenosis (aortic valve area 0.52
cm2), severe 4+ mitral regurgitation, and severe pulmonary
hypertension.  He is a non operative candidate due to his
porcelain aorta.
.
Heparin (5000U, 2000U) was used for anticoagulation to maintain
an ACT > 250 seconds.
.
The procedure was performed using a Pre-close technique with a 6
Fr Proglide.  Femoral access was obtained with vascular
ultrasound guidance.
.
Right and left heart pressures are listed above with severe
pulmonary hypertension and a mixed venous saturation 51%.
.
Balloon aortic valvuloplasty was performed using a single
inflation using a 23 mm Tyshak-II balloon.  The patient became
profoundly hypotensive after the balloon inflation taking > 60
seconds to recovery his BP.
.
The mean aortic gradient decreased from 26.9 mmHg to 21.4 mmHg,
the cardiac output increased from 2.89 L/Min to 3.67 L/min, and
the aortic valve area increased from 0.53 cm2 to 0.80 cm2.  The
mixed venous increased from 51% to 60%.
.
The right femoral artery sheath was removed without difficulty.
Assessment & Recommendations
1.	Critical aortic stenosis
2.	s/p successful balloon aortic valvuloplasty with an increase
in the aortic valve area from 0.52 cm2 to 0.80 cm2
3.	CCU monitoring overnight with diuresis

.
TTE: [**2174-8-1**]:
The left atrium is markedly dilated. There is mild symmetric
left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF=
25-30%). The right ventricular cavity is moderately dilated with
depressed free wall contractility. There is abnormal septal
motion/position consistent with right ventricular
pressure/volume overload. The aortic valve leaflets are severely
thickened/deformed. There is severe aortic valve stenosis (valve
area 0.8-1.0cm2). Mild to moderate ([**12-20**]+) aortic regurgitation
is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The
mitral valve leaflets do not fully coapt. An eccentric,
posteriorly directed jet of severe mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate [2+]
tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is severe pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
.
IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric LVH with severe left ventricular
systolic dysfunction. The inferior wall and distal septum are
near-akinetic. The basal lateral wall has relatively preserved
function. The other walls are moderately hypokinetic. There is
severe mitral regurgitation likely due to leaflet tethering.
Severe calcific aortic stenosis with mild to moderate aortic
regurgitation. Dilated, hypokinetic and pressure-volume
overloaded RV with severe pulmonary hypertension.
.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2174-6-28**],
findings are similar.
.
TTE: [**2174-8-2**]
Left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed. The
aortic valve leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. There is
significant aortic valve stenosis (probably severe). Moderate
(2+) aortic regurgitation is seen. T
