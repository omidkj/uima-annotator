Brief Hospital Course:
44 y/o female admitted with BRBPR and Hct drop from 38.7% to
25.5%. She was admitted to the SICU and received four units of
packed cells, with subsequent resonse to 40%. Over the next few
days her Hct remained stable with no further bleeding noted, Hct
at discharge was 37.9%.
GI was consulted and a colonoscopy was performed after an bowel
prep with IV hydration to prevent dehydration given ischemic
bowel. She tolerated the prep and underwent the colonoscopy on
[**7-17**].
Results as follows:
Presumed pseudopolyps scattered throughout the descending and
transverse colon (biopsy)
Severe circumferential ulceration beginning at 90cm (biopsy)
Otherwise normal colonoscopy to 90 cm
Recommendations: Follow up biopsies
Resume ASA/Plavix and consider right hemicolectomy as below
Additional notes: The patient likely bled from the ulcerated
area at 90cm and this is likely ischemic in nature. We elected
not to continue the exam because of the severity of the
inflammation and risk of perforation. Although the smaller left
sided pseudopolyps could have bled, these are less likely to
account for the magnitude of her HCT drop. Would restart
ASA/Plavix while awaiting biopsies. The risk of rebleeding is
exceedingly high but, so is the risk of infarction.

Post colonoscopy, vital signs were stable and she felt well
without any abdominal pain. Findings were communicated to the
surgeon. Aspirin and plavix were resumed and she was discharged
home with instruction to hydrate well and call with any
bleeding, abdominal pain or dizziness/lightheadedness.

Podiatry saw her to evaluate a right heel ulcer. This appeared
to be healing well.

She was discharged home in stable condition with a follow up
appointment arranged on [**7-20**] with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 816**].
