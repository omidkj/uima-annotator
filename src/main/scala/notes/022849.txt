Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1881**]
Chief Complaint:
hypercarbic respiratory failure

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Endotracheal intubation and ventilation


History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is an 82 year old with woman with a history of DMII,
HTN, Asthma, OSA, dCHF, peripheral neuropathy who is admitted
for AMS and hypercapnea.
.
Patient was recently admitted at [**Hospital1 18**] [**2129-11-22**], at the time she
had presented with AMS, was found to be hypercarbic and
requiring intubation, she was noted to have fluid overload and
was diuresed with lasix, she did not have evidence of pneumonia,
LENIs were negative, and echocardiogram showed a preserved
biventricular systolic function without pulmonary hypertension.
Therefore, it was felt that her hypercarbia was due to not
wearing night time BIPAP for successive days leading to slow
increase in her PCO2 +/- central apnea. She did well after
extubation and was discharged to rehab with nighttime BiPAP and
oral lasix.
.
Per her daughter at baseline prior to previous hospitalization
was wheelchair bound most of the day but could make a few
independent steps to the bathroom. Needed help in ADL. Demented
with occasional visual + auditory halucination.  At rehad
continued to complain of weakness but did PT, walk around some
with a walker. Per daughter patient was using BiPAP [**Hospital **] rehab but
continued to have issues with ill fitting mask.  Per rehab
patient was fine last night, on check this AM around 10:15
patient was found to be lethargic. No recent fevers or illness
recorded. In the ED patient was conversant and reported wearing
her BIPAP yesterday evening. Denied HA, blurry vision, CP, SOB,
abdominal pain, dysuria, or increased LE edema. Pt stated she's
been compliant with meds at rehab. She stated she feel fine
except for "tiredness". States she did not sleep well last
night, cannot say why.

Past Medical History:
-type 2 diabetes mellitus
-hypertension
-atypical peripheral neuropathy with cutaneous sensations ("dust

on her skin", seen by Neurology, on gabapentin + olanzapine)  -
tactile hallucinosis per PCP
[**Name Initial (NameIs) 15372**]: appears to be adult onset asthma. [**2113**] spirometry is
restrictive physiology with bronchodilator response.
-macular edema s/p surgery
-neovascular glaucoma secondary to her proliferative diabetic
retinopathy
-OSA (prescribed BiPAP, not currently using)
-osteoarthritis
-dementia
-blind in left eye

Social History:
Patient is wheelchair bound due to old osteoarthritis and vision
loss. Born and grew up in the Carribean. Worked in a chocolate
factory in [**Location (un) **] in the [**2066**]. Arrived in the US in [**2077**].
Denies tobacco, EtOH, IVDA. She lives with her daughter [**Name (NI) **]

Family History:
Father with diabetes mellitus, died at age 69.  Mother with
heart failure, died at age [**Age over 90 **].  Oldest daughter with diabetes
mellitus and polymyositis. Youngest daughter with anoxic brain
injury [**12-16**] trauma, in rehab.

Pertinent Results:
Imaging Studies
upper extremity u/s doppler
FINDINGS: [**Doctor Last Name **]-scale and color Doppler assessment with pectoral
analysis of the bilateral subclavian veins and the right
axillary, brachial, basilic, and cephalic veins was performed.
There is normal compressibility, flow and
augmentation.
IMPRESSION: No right upper extremity DVT.

cxr [**12-3**]
Position of the endotracheal tube is unchanged. The exact
position of the
nasogastric tube cannot be determined on current chest x-ray but
appears to be in a satisfactory position on the recently
obtained chest CT. Tip of the endotracheal tube currently lies
4.2 cm from the carinal angle. The lung fields remain clear.

cta chest
IMPRESSION:
1. No pulmonary embolism.
2. No acute aortic syndrome.
3. Small left-sided effusion with associated atelectasis.
4. Small hiatal hernia.

ct head
FINDINGS: There is no evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage,
edema, mass effect, or acute vascular territorial infarct.
[**Doctor Last Name **]-white matter
differentiation is preserved. The ventricles and sulci are
normal in
configuration and size. Note is again made of extensive
parafalcine
calcifications. No fracture is identified. The imaged portions
of the
mastoid air cells and paranasal sinuses appear well aerated.
IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial process.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is an 82 year old woman with DMII, HTN, Asthma, OSA,
dCHF, peripheral neuropathy with recent previous admission
[**2129-11-22**] with hypercarbic respiratory failure who was admitted
again for AMS and respiratory failure.
.
# Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure with alterered mental status:
This was felt most likely related to hypercapnea from Bipap
non-comliance. She was intubated on HD1 for hypercapneic
respiratory failure (pco2 of 97). She was extubated on HD2.
After extubation she was alert and oriented times three and was
called out to the medicine floor. On the floor she continued to
do well with nightly bipap. We discussed how important it is for
her to use regular bipap every night. She must use Bipap every
single night.
.
# Acute on Chronic Diastolic Heart Failure. She was volume
overloaded on presentation. She was diuresed with IV furosemide
a total of 3 L while in the MICU. She was restarted on 20 mg of
furosemide while
