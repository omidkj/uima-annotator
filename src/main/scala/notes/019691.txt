[**5-12**] Cardiac cath: 1.  Selective coronary angiography of this
left dominant system revealed 3 vessel coronary artery disease.
The LMCA had no angiographically apparent flow limiting
epicardial coronary artery disease.  The LAD had a 70% mid and a
60% mid vessel stenosis with mild diffuse disease.  The LCx had
a 90% mid vessel stenosis.  The RCA had an 80% proximal and an
80% mid-vessel lesion and was a small, non-dominant vessel. 2.
Resting hemodynamics revealed elevated right and left filling
pressures with LVEDP 24 mmHg and RVEDP 13 mmHg.  The pulmonary
artery systolic pressure was mildly elevated with a PASP of 31
mmHg.  The cardiac index was [**Month/Day (4) 61102**] at 1.93 L/min/m2.  There
was mild systemic systolic arterial hypertension with SBP 147
mmHg. 3.  There was no transvalvular gradient upon pullback of
the catheter from the left ventricle to the aorta. 4.  Left
ventriculography reealed [**3-16**]+ mitral regurgitation.  The LVEF
was calculated to be 25% with inferior akinesis and moderately
severe
anterior hypokinesis

[**5-16**]/ Echo: PRE-CPB:1. The left atrium is markedly dilated. No
spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body of the left
atrium. A left atrial appendage thrombus cannot be excluded. 2.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. 3. There
is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. There is severe
regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with infero and
inferoseptal hypokinesis. LVEF is 25% 4. Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. 5. There are
simple atheroma in the aortic root. There are simple atheroma in
the ascending aorta. There are simple atheroma in the aortic
arch. There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending
thoracic aorta. 6. There are three aortic valve leaflets. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is a
minimally increased gradient consistent with minimal aortic
valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. 7. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. No mass or vegetation is
seen on the mitral valve. Moderate to severe (3+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is a central jet with an annular
dimension of 2.7 cm. 8. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 914**] was notified in person of
the results. POST CPB: On infusions of epi, milrinone, neo.
Well-seated annuloplasty ring in the mitral position. No MR.
Gradient of 11 mmHg on inotropes with CO= 6.0, consistent with
mild MS. Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 6507**] present to perform 3-D views. Improved LV
systolic function with LVEF= 35%. No evidence of [**Male First Name (un) **]. Aortic
contour normal post decannulation.


[**5-13**] CAROTID U/S: Normal carotid study

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2177-5-21**] 4:49 PM
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST
Reason: eval for peri-operative CVA
[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
67 year old woman s/p MVring and CABG now w r-sided weakness
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
eval for peri-operative CVA
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.
HEAD CT
HISTORY: 67-year-old woman status post mitral valve ring and
CABG surgery, now with right-sided weakness.
TECHNIQUE: Contiguous non-contrast axial images of the head were
obtained.
FINDINGS: No comparisons are available.
There is a hypodensity involving the right occipital lobe which
is consistent with either subacute or old infarct. No acute
infarcts are identified. There is a minimal amount of
periventricular white matter hypodensities which likely
represent chronic microangiopathic change. Small perivascular
spaces are seen in the basal ganglia regions bilaterally.
There are no intracranial hemorrhages.
The visualized orbits are normal. The visualized paranasal
sinuses and mastoid air cells are clear. No suspicious bony
abnormalities are seen.
IMPRESSION: Subacute to old infarct of the right occipital lobe.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2177-5-19**] 8:11 AM
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
Reason: ? effusion, PTX
[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
67 year old woman with s/p cabg
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
? effusion, PTX
CHEST RADIOGRAPH
INDICATION: Followup.
COMPARISON: [**2177-5-18**].
As compared to the previous examination, there is a slight
increase in retrocardiac density, presumably caused by
atelectasis. The size of the cardiac silhouette is unchanged. No
newly appeared parenchymal opacities. No relevant overhydration.
The monitoring and support devices are in unchanged position.


Brief Hospital Course:
67F smoker w/ no medical care in over 15 years, untreated HTN,
was transferred from OSH with acute MI and antero-lateral
depressions and brief inferior elevations, and 3v-disease on
cardiac cath and severe MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 61102**] EF 25-30%.
She was seen by cardiac surgery. SHe was cleared by dental. She
awaited plavix washout prior to being taken to the operating
room on [**5-16**] where she underwent a CABG x 4/MV Repair. She was
transferred to the ICU in stable condition on epi, milrnone, neo
and propofol. She remained intubated ov
