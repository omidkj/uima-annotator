Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1561**]
Chief Complaint:
left upper lobe squamous cell
carcinoma, either metastatic versus a new primary

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
L thoracotomy with LULobectomy [**2121-5-26**]


History of Present Illness:
Patient is a delightful woman who
has been diagnosed and treated for laryngeal carcinoma. This
included surgery as well as radiotherapy. She also
subsequently developed a left upper lobe squamous cell
carcinoma, either metastatic versus a new primary and
underwent a left thoracotomy with wedge excision in [**2116**] by
Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 175**].  Recently, she has been found to have a
recurrent mass in the left upper lobe, suspicious for either
recurrent squamous cell or a new primary within the lung.
Obviously, it is difficult to determine whether this is a
metastatic lesion or primary lung cancer; however, it is her
only site of recurrence on extensive metastatic workup. We
therefore took her forward for completion left upper
lobectomy.
