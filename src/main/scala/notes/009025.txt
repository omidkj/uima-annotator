HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname 20464**] is a 52-year-old
gentleman with a past medical history significant for
insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, end-stage renal disease
(on peritoneal dialysis), multiple episodes of peritonitis,
polysubstance abuse (alcohol and cocaine), coronary artery
disease, and congestive heart failure.  He is status post
recent discharge from this hospital for [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]
parapsilosis.  He was sent to the hospital for this admission
by [**Hospital6 407**] after being discovered to have
possible left toe gangrene at home.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  He was seen by the Vascular Surgery team
who thought that surgical intervention was not necessary at
this time.

During the course of his stay on the floor he was lethargic
with systolic blood pressures ranging in the 80s.  His normal
blood pressure runs in the low 100s.  After a sustained
period of lethargy with systolic pressures in the 80s, he was
transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit.  His blood
pressure continued to fall despite adding on broad spectrum
antibiotic coverage.  He was started on pressor therapy with
Levophed and then Neo-Synephrine.  Despite using
supratherapeutic doses of these blood pressure medications we
were unable to maintain his blood pressure at a level to
adequately perfuse his vital organs.

Given his poor response to intensive medical therapy, the
focus of his care was shifted to providing comfort measures.
He expired on [**10-23**].
