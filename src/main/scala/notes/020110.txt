Brief Hospital Course:
# Respiratory distress: Ms. [**Known lastname 16352**] was admitted to the
floor for treatment of her pneumonia/hypoxia.  She was intially
treated with levofloxacin, and then ceftriaxone/azithromycin for
presumed community-acquired bacterial pneumonia.  On this
regimen, however, her hypoxia worsened (in spite of some
diuresis) and she developed a leukocytosis and some delirium.
Considering her recent discharge from rehab, it was thought that
her pneumonia may have been nosocomial so her antibiotics were
changed to vanco/Zosyn.  She had a PICC line placed for
outpatient IV antibiotics.  With this regimen, her leukocytosis
and delirium improved, and her oxygen requirement initially
improved but then worsened and she was transferred to the unit
and intubated. She completed the course of vanco/zosyn but
continued to have heavy secretions which grew out MRSA. Another
7 day course of vanc/zosyn was started on [**2-17**] and the zosyn was
completed, but the vanc was changed to linezolid since MRSA
repeatedly grew out of sputum and BAL cultures. A 10 day course
of linezolid was completed on [**3-2**]. She was diuresed aggressively
with the thought that pulm edema could have been restricting her
respiratory status. However, she was extubated twice and both
times had to be reintubated. The reasons for this were thought
to be secondary to copious upper airway secretions (which her
family members remark have been present in the past) in
combination with altered mental status requiring sedatives. Both
times the patient initially looked well after extubation, but
she remained confused and had a difficult time coughing up her
copious upper airway secretions. She also had severe OSA. She
would become agitated and try to get out of bed, but even mildly
sedating meds such as zyprexa would make her somnolent and then
her upper airway would become obstructed. Bipap seemed to help
temporarily, but when she would wake up she would become
agitated and would not tolerate the mask. After the 3rd
intubation it was felt she will require a long wean off the vent
hopefully after her mental status improves so that she may
cooperate. A trach and PEG were placed. She will require further
aggressive attempts to get her off of ventilatory support.
Incidentally, she was noted to have persistent elevation of her
right hemidiaphragm and at some point in the future she should
have inspiratory/expiratory CXRs to evaluate for diaphragmatic
paralysis (which may be contributing to her repeated
pneumonias).
.
# Urinary tract infection/fevers: the patient had her foley
changed and Ua sent on [**3-5**] which had many WBC's. She then
started spiking fevers and was started on ciprofloxacin on [**3-6**]
with plan for 7 day treatment. Urine culture is still pending at
the time of discharge and should be followed up on to ensure
that ciproflox is an adequate antibiotic for treatment.
.
# C.diff: Three days into this antibiotic course, she developed
diarrhea and stool studies returned positive for C. Difficile
toxin A.  She was started on metronidazole and was continued on
this until she finished her vanco/Zosyn/Linezolid course. Her
diarrhea cleared and WBC went down.
.
# Anemia: She was noted to be markedly anemic upon admission.
Her iron studies were consistent with iron deficiency anemia, so
her PO iron polysaccharide dose was increased.  Her
erythropoeitin level was elevated, implying that she simply does
not have the iron stores for adequate erythropoeisis.  Given her
history of colon cancer, her PCP may decide to repeat a
colonoscopy (though this was negative in 6/[**2198**]). Hct was
relatively stable for most of the admission.
.
# ARF on CRI/Volume status: Several days into her
hospitalization, her creatinine was noted to increase up from a
baseline of 1.6 to a peak of 2.1.  It was presumed that she may
have been prerenal from overdiuresis.  She experienced some
improvement with gentle hydration, but the slow recovery of her
renal function implied that she may have also had a component of
ATN in the setting of her septicemia. She did not require HD and
Cr improved with time back to baseline. She required some doses
of lasix to aggressively diurese and seemed to respond best to
500mg IV diuril followed by 100mg of lasix. Lower doses or using
lasix alone often did not seem to instigate an increase in urine
output. On [**3-3**] she was given a dose of diuril and lasix and
diuresed about 3L over the next 2 days. However, late on [**3-5**] her
UOP dropped and since has remained at approx 15cc/hour. Ua
showed a UTI and she was started on ciprofloxacin. FeUrea was
calculated at 8% (indicating possible prerenal physiology) but
the pt did not respond to a 1L fluid bolus (no increased urine
output). A CXR later showed increasing pulm edema and pleural
effusions. At the time of discharge ([**3-6**]) the plan was to treat
the pt's UTI with Cipro but avoid giving further IVF given the
pulmonary edema, however, if she continues to spike fevers she
may require further IVF. It is hoped that once the patient is
able to get out of bed more she will be able to mobilize fluids
and diurese on her own.

# altered mental status: Her family noted that when she returned
home from her last stay at rehab, she was "as
