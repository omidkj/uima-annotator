Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2387**]
Chief Complaint:
Bradycardia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Pacemaker implant

History of Present Illness:
This is an 83 yo male with a history of CAD, CHF, CKD, and a.fib
who presents with sympomatic bradycardia. The symptoms
apparently began this morning when his caregivers noted that he
was "not himself". He noted that he felt dizzy standing up in
the morning to shave and had multiple presyncopal episodes
throughout the day. He does note some mild DOE starting today
but denies any chest discomfort. Prior to today he was in his
USOH, fully functional. Later that day, his grandaughter found
him at home, diaphoretic, nauseous, and with decreased
responsiveness. He was sitting in a chair and was thought to
maybe pass out at one point, when his eyes rolled back in his
head. 911 was then called.

EMS responded to the scene and found his heart rate to be in the
20s with a BP of 80s/P. He was given bicarb and atropine by EMS
with no effect. They tried to externally pace him but could not
capture.

On arrival to the ED, initial vitals were 97.5, 36, 112/43,
satting 99% on 4L. His FS was noted to be greater than assay. At
this time he was much more responsive and with stable BP. He
received 10units IV insulin and 2L NS.

Brief Hospital Course:
This is an 83 year old male with extensive CAD, CHF, CKD, and
a.fib presents with new onset bradycardia and hyperglycemia.
.
# Bradycardia: Unclear precipitant but his baseline EKG showed
RBBB and LAFB so any further conduction system degeneration
would likely result in complete heart block, likely infranodal,
which is more likely given his lack of response to atropine. No
signs of acute ischemia and cardiac enzymes were cycled to
confirm. According to his family, SOB is pt's anginal
equivalent.

Pt initially had temporary pacer wire placed after INR reversed
with FFP. Permanent pacemaker was placed the next morning, which
pt tolerated well and had no furthur arrhythmias. There was no
indication for ICD and warfarin was restarted prior to DC.

# GI bleed: On [**11-23**] pt passed some guaiac positive dark stool
with question of flecks of blood, in the setting of dropped
hematocrit to 24.2 Pt remained hemodynamically stable and was
transfused one unit of pRBCs. He was held over the weekend for
lowering of INR and prep for EGD and colonoscopy given unstable
hematocrit and anticoagulation. Monday with INR of 1.7, pt was
taken for EGD which showed gastritis and duodenitis with
biopsies taken, and also a colonoscopy with multiple polyps but
polypectomy not done and pt recommended to have repeat scope
with lower INR and better prep. Pt's hematocrit remained stable
and he did not have any more guaiac positive stools. On
discharge hematocrit was 27.9.

#Hyperglycemia: Cause was unclear as there was no signs of
infection on U/A or CXR and no localizing signs. [**Month (only) 116**] be a sign
of coronary ischemia. Patient denied missing medications and has
been well controlled on them prior. Pt was initially on insulin
drip for several hours and then was well controlled on insulin
sliding scale.

# Dementia and mental status changes: Pt showed signs of
delirium, with visual and auditory hallucinations in the ICU.
History of dementia with ongoing workup exacerbated by blindness
and ICU delirium.  Recent MRI ([**9-11**]) showed microvascular
ischemia.  No evidence of infection by fever or WBC, and neuro
exam was unchanged throughout. Pt responded well to Haldol 2mg
as needed at night. Delirium resolved once pt was transferred to
the floor.

# Acute on chronic renal failure: On presentation, Cr was
elevated to 2.5 from basline 1.7-1.9, thought to be secondary to
poor forward flow in setting of bradycardia. Renal function was
monitored and improved with pacing of heart rate. ACEi was
initially held and restarted prior to discharge.

# Hyponatremia: Pt with sodium 131 on admission likely due to
hyperglycemia, and resolved with control of BS.

# HTN: Initially home PO regimen was held due to
hypotension/bradycardia and restarted. Pt discharged on
beta-blocker, ACEi and lasix.

# CAD: On presentation troponins were slightly elevated, thought
to be secondary to renal failure. Pt was medically managed with
ASA, statin, ACEi, beta blocker once appropriate with blood
pressure and renal function.

# CHF: Restarted on home doses of ACEi, lasix and BB once
tolerated by blood pressure and renal function.

# PVD: Stable. Pt continued on Cilostazol

# Hyperlipidemia: Continued on statin

# Atrial fibrillation: Initially did not require rate control
due to presumed AV disease and heart block. Pt's coumadin was
held briefly for PPM placement, bridged with heparin and
coumadin restarted.

# Iron Def. Anemia: Stable at baseline, continue iron.
