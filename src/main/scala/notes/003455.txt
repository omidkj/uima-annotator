Colonoscopy: [**2175-7-14**]
Findings: Flat Lesions A localized AVM that was actively
bleeding was seen in the cecum. APC was applied to this lesion
with subsequent hemostasis.  Protruding Lesions Small
non-bleeding grade 2 internal hemorrhoids were noted in the
sigmoid [**Last Name (un) **]. Excavated Lesions A few non-bleeding diverticula
were seen in the sigmoid. Diverticulosis appeared to be of mild
severity.
Impression:
Grade 2 internal hemorrhoids
Diverticulosis of the sigmoid
Angioectasia in the cecal
Otherwise normal colonoscopy to cecum


Brief Hospital Course:
79M with history of afib (on coumadin) and recent diagnosis of
CML on gleevec, history of diverticulosis, and hemorrhoids
transferred from OSH to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2175-7-12**] with 10 days of bright
red blood per rectum associated with presyncope and SOB on

# AVM: Patient was admitted because of large bloody bowel
movements for 10 days.  On admission his hematocrit was found to
be 21.6% down from 29.2 a month ago.  He was admitted directly
to the MICU where he received 2 units of blood transfusion and 1
unit of FFP to reverse his INR.  After prep, he had a
colonoscopy which showed bleeding AVMs which were then
cauterized.  Patient's hematocrit remained stable after the
colonoscopy, he tolerated full diet and did not have any further
episodes of bloody bowel movements.  Per gastroenterology, his
coumadin will be held for five days after colonoscopy. (See
Below) He was discharged to follow p with PCP.

his Coumadin on [**2175-7-19**] and follow up with his PCP titrate
his Coumadin dose.  Patient's home atenolol was also stopped on

resuscitation his Cr continued to trend down with discharge Cr
of 1.3.  On admission home, lasix, lisinopril and atenolol were
held.  Patient will follow up with PCP to resume these
medications.
