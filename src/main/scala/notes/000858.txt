HISTORY: 72-year-old male with mottled right foot, concern for
vascular
disease.

FINDINGS:

CT OF ABDOMEN AND PELVIS: Imaged lung parenchyma reveals 5-mm
pulmonary
nodule in the lingula and a calcified 2-mm nodule in right
middle lobe that are stable since [**2157**]. Previously described
nodule in the anterior right middle lobe appears to be of
ground- glass density on today's study and is unchanged in size.
There is no pericardial or pleural effusion.

Gallstones in otherwise unremarkable gallbladder. A 9-mm nodule
with
indeterminate features in the left adrenal gland seems to be
present in [**2159**] study, but it is difficult to compare due to
different techniques. The liver, spleen, right adrenal gland,
and kidneys are unremarkable. The pancreas is atrophic without
focal lesions. Bowel loops are normal in caliber. There are no
pathologically enlarged mesenteric or retroperitoneal lymph
nodes.

CT OF THE PELVIS: Urinary bladder appears unremarkable. Prostate
gland is
enlarged and heterogenous, with gross calcifications, measuring
up to 72 mm in laterolateral diameter. Seminal vesicles are
unremarkable. There are no pathologically enlarged pelvic lymph
nodes. There is no free fluid or free air in pelvic cavity.

CT ANGIOGRAM: Abdominal aorta is normal in size without evidence
of
dissection. Atherosclerotic changes with calcifications and
mural plaques,
some of them ulcerated, are noted along the arterial tree. A
focal ectasia of proximal celiac artery is identified, although
the origin is not narrowed. The origins of the superior
mesenteric, single renals and inferior mesenteric arteries are
patent.

On the right side, the common and external iliac arteries are
patent. There is a tight stenosis (60%) with post-stenotic
dilatation of the right internal iliac artery (3A:135). The
common, deep and superficial femoral arteries are unremarkable.
There is a 41 x 32 mm mostly thrombosed aneurysm of the
popliteal artery that extends for approximately 60 mm. There is
no opacification of AT. PT is patent, giving off branches to the
plantar arch. The DP opacifies from the collaterals coming from
the plantar arch. Peroneal artery has a narrowed origin, and
presents with multilevel disease.

On the left side, the origin of the common iliac artery is
narrowed, and then becomes aneurysmal, measuring up to 20 mm and
with large irregular areas of contrast pooling about the
periphery and separated from the vessel lumen by curvilinear
density, an appearance that may represent extensive ulcerated
plaque but could also represent chronic focal dissection. The
internal iliac artery presents a focal 12- mm aneurysm. The
external iliac artery and femoral arteries are unremarkable.
There is a 42 x 41 x 42-mm mostly thrombosed aneurysm in the
popliteal artery. There is no opacification of AT. The flow in
PT and peroneal arteries is delayed compared to the
contralateral side (could be due to proximal disease). The
peroneal artery has a narrowed origin, opacifies well only until
the mid- calf, and then shows faint opacification, but could be
due to a very slow flow. The patent PT gives off dorsalis pedis.

DP is filled by collaterals from the plantar arch.

OSSEOUS STRUCTURES: Bilateral spondylolysis and grade 1
anterolisthesis are noted at L5- S1. Degenerative changes in
spine.

IMPRESSION:
1. Bilateral mostly thrombosed popliteal artery aneurysm,
measuring up to 42 mm.
2. Aneurysm of the left common iliac artery that presents with
complicated
probable ulcerated plaques vs focal dissection with multiple
areas of saccular foci of contrast, measuring up to 20 mm.
3. Focal aneurysm of the left internal iliac artery.
4. No opacification of anterior tibialis arteries bilaterally.
5. Delayed flow in the left PT and peroneal arteries.
6. Narrowing at the origin of the left common iliac, the right
internal iliac and both peroneal arteries.
7. Gallstones.
8. Left adrenal gland nodule, indeterminate but possibly
previously present.
9. Stable lingular and right middle lobe nodules stable since
[**2157**] consistent with benignity. Ground- glass opacity in right
middle lobe is stable.  Continued attention may be paid at next
follow up.


Brief Hospital Course:
Admitted through ED.  Currently coming in with 1-2 day h/o
sudden onset of pain in RLE that has progressed over pastday to
point where he has had difficulty ambulating.  Patientstates
initially he felt like he 'pulled a muscle' in his
hamstring.  Pain also in calf.  He was having difficulty moving
legs and had numbness of his right foot causing difficulty
ambulating and causing him to fall.  Also states difficulty
moving left leg. feels like he has to pull his leg forward.

Diagnosis of Compartment syndrome. He agreed to have an elective
surgery. Pre-operatively, he was consented. A CXR, EKG, UA, CBC,
Electrolytes, T/S - were obtained,  all other preperations were
made.

Pt started on IV heparin drip. Moniter of PTT. To be DC'd on
Lovenox untill surgery.
Bicarb drip started.

He underwent a:

Right leg 3-compartment fasciotomy.
VAC dressing placed.

He was prepped, and brought down to the operating room for
surgery. Intra-operatively, he was closely monitored and
remained hemodynamically stable. He tolerated the procedure well
without any difficulty or complication.

Post-operatively, he was extubated and transferred to the CVICU
for further stabilization and monitoring.

His CK's were followed:

[**Numeric Identifier 35553**]*, [**Numeric Identifier **]*, [**Numeric Identifier 97371**]*, 9357*, 7560*, 5571*, 2291*. All in a
downtrend. On Dc his leg has less pan, improved movement and
sensation.
