History of Present Illness:
56 yo M with a past medical history of ESRD on HD, DM1, CHF
presents from HD with nausea and vomitting. History is unclear
because patient is unresponsive, but history is gathered from
family members and [**Name (NI) **] documentation. Mr. [**Known lastname **] has a history of
noncompliance, and evidently skipped HD on Saturday. He was
found to be weak this morning, and his brother brought him to
HD. At HD, patient was noted to have periorbital edema. He
received 45 minutes of HD and developed nausea and vomitting x1.
Vomitus was grossly nonbloody and guaiac positive, so he was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].
.
According to the family, patient was supposed go to HD on
saturday (last HD was the previous Thurday), but did not tell
family why he was not going. They noticed that his face and eyes
were swollen, and sugar was noted to be elevated. He had reduced
po intake over the last 4 days. He was not complainig of
particular symptoms including fevers, chest pain, palpitations
or lightheadedness.
.
At [**Hospital1 18**], patient was A and O x3 but belligerent and refusing
labs and venous access. His HCP was called, and because there
was a question of competence in the past, sister gave approval
to sedate and restrain as needed for appropriate workup. He was
given Haldol 5 mg IM and Ativan 2 mg IM and placed in 4 point
restraints. An 18 G IV was obtained. Serum glucose was found to
be 815 with a gap of 17, so IV insulin 10 U was given. He did
not receive fluids because of concern that the patient is
anuric. Patient refused a rectal, but there was a report of
loose stool last week before the patient was chemically sedated.
CXR was reportedly normal. Blood culture were sent. On transfer,
patient was unresponsive but maintaing his airway, with VS 95,
95/62, 14, 96% RA
.
In the ICU, patient is unresponsive but appears comfortable.

CXR: No evidence of volume overload.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was found to have serum glucose 815 with gap of 17
and was started on an insulin drip for treatment of diabetic
ketoacidosis and admitted to MICU.  At this time, the patient
allegedly endorsed active SI and was agitated, requiring
restraints and haloperidol/lorazepam for sedation.  Gap was
gradually closed overnight and patient remained hemodynamically
stable.  Patient noted to have loose stools in the MICU, found
to be C. difficile positive with no evidence of severe
infection; he was started on Flagyl.  His insulin regimen was
titrated with input from the endocrinologists at [**Last Name (un) **].  The
patient remained cryptic as to why he had not been compliant
with his insulin regimen but was cooperative for the remainder

The patient was seen by Psychiatry during the admission due to
his alleged endorsement of SI; however, at the time of
assessment patient repeatedly denied SI.  Psychiatry noted that
his father is the patient's guardian, as established in court,
and that his guardian's wishes should determine medical
management.

Following his MICU stay, the patient's blood pressures remained
low but stable as long as most of his blood pressure medications
were held.  The patient had no evidence of sepsis; it was felt
that his blood pressure may have been [**12-30**] fluid removal during
dialysis.  At the time of discharge, given that the patient's
blood pressures had ranged in the low 100s systolic on a
beta-blocker alone, we discontinued the patient's other
anti-hypertensives on discharge.  His blood pressure should be
followed on an outpatient basis and his regimen uptitrated as
warranted.
