Pertinent Results:
Echo [**2190-11-19**]
The left atrium is elongated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
and cavity size are normal. There is moderate regional left
ventricular systolic dysfunction with focal severe hypokinesis
of the distal half of the anterior septum and anterior walls,
and the distal lateral and distal inferior walls. The apex is
mildly aneurysmal akinetic. No intravventricular thrombus is
seen, but images are suboptimal. The remaining segments contract
normally (LVEF = 35%). The aortic root is mildly dilated at the
sinus level. The ascending aorta and aortic arch are mildly
dilated. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There
is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. Trivial
mitral regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary artery systolic
pressure could not be determined. There is an anterior space
which most likely represents a fat pad.

IMPRESSION: Moderate regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction suggestive of CAD (mid-LAD distribution).

[**11-18**] CXR
Lungs are clear. No pleural effusion. Heart size top normal.
Thoracic aorta tortuous or dilated, but unchanged. No
pneumothorax.

[**11-18**] Cardiac Cath
1.  Selective angiography in this right dominant patient
revealed severe native three vessel CAD.  The left main had no
significant stenosis.  The LAD had proximal diffuse disease, a
mid
disrupted segment culminating in mid stenosis.  The first large
diagonal
had an ostial 80% lesion. The LCX had a 60% OM.  The RCA had
diffuse
disease to 80% distal and was a small vessel.  There was some
competetive flow from the very large slow flowing SVG-RCA.
2. Grafts angiography showed the SVG-RCA to be patent with very
slow
flow due to the tremendous size mismatch between graft and
native
vessel.  The SVG-LAD was occluded and the LIMA-Diagonal is known

atretic.
3. Limited hemodynamics with BP 117/74 with HR 79 in sinus. The
patient
tolerated the procedure very well.
4. Stenting of LAD with 5 Vision stents in overlapping fashion
to
the ostium.  From distal to proximal they were 2.25x18, 2.5x23,
2.75x23,
2.75x28, 3.0x18
5. POBA of jailed diagonal with 2.5mm balloon.
5. Successful closure with Mynx.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Acute coronary syndrome
3. Stenting of LAD and POBA of diagonal.

[**12-20**] EKG
Sinus rhythm with premature atrial contractions. Extensive
anterolateral
myocardial infarction, age undetermined. Compared to tracing #2
the rate has decreased. The other findings are similar.


Brief Hospital Course:
79 yo male with h/o 3V CABG (LIMA-D1, SVG-LAD, SVG-RCA), s/p
balloon angioplasty to OM1 [**4-3**], DM, PVD s/p bilateral BKA
presents with chest pain and 1mm STEMI in septal leads found to
have occluded SVG-LAD now s/p 5 BMS.

# s/p STEMI: Patient was transfered from OSH with elevated
troponins and 1mm ST elevations in septal and lateral leads.  At
Cath, patient found to have complete occlusion of SVG-LAD graft.
 As a result, native LAD was stented and had 5 BMS placed to
reopen the vessel.  Patient had persistent chest pain during the
procedure that persisted after transfer to floor.  Patient was
on Nitro gtt titrated to CP control that was weaned off.  CK
peaked at 523 on day of admission. On discharge patient will
need to be on Aspirin, Plavix, Beta Blocker, ACE-I. Patient to
follow up with Cardiology.
- Continue ASA 325mg for 30 days and 81mg thereafter
- Continue Plavix 75mg daily for minimum 1-3 months.
- Continue Toprol XL 100mg daily
- Continue Lisinopril 20mg daily
- Continue Simvastatin 80mg daily

# Chronic systolic heart failure:  Echo [**2190-12-20**] shows EF 35%
with moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction
with focal severe hypokinesis of the distal half of the anterior
septum and anterior walls, distal lateral and distal inferior
walls. The apex is mildly aneurysmal and akinetic.  Mr. [**Known lastname 33754**]
remained euvolemic on throughout his sat and was continued on
his home dose of Lasix 40mg [**Hospital1 **].

# RHYTHM: Patient has history of paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation
however was in normal sinus rhythm throughout his stay.
Additionally, he has a history of DVT/PE in the past.  Mr
[**Known lastname 33754**] was continued on Coumadin at 1 mg (MO,WE,FR) and 2mg
([**Doctor First Name **],TU,TH,SA).
- As an outpatient, patient's INR will have to be checked and
dose of Coumadin will have to be adjusted accordingly.

# Diabetes:  Patient was placed on an insulin sliding scale as
an inpatient, switched back to home Glipizide on discharge.

#COPD:  Patient had been admitted while taking Prednisone 7.5mg
daily, for unclear reasons.  Mr. [**Known lastname 33754**]' PCP was [**Name (NI) 653**] and
he is apparently taking this for a recent COPD exacerbation.
Prednisone was continued throughout his stay and will be tapered
by his PCP as an outpatient.

#HTN:  Controlled on Metoprolol, Lisinopril, and Imdur.
