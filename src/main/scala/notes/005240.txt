CT ABD/PELVIS NON CON. [**2117-2-1**] IMPRESSION:
1. Ill-defined mass within liver, for which further with
dedicated MRI is recommended.
2. Bilateral hydronephrosis and hydroureter. Obstruction at UVJ
secondary to bladder mass cannot be excluded on this
non-contrast exam. Recommend correlation with urine cytology
and/or cystoscopy.
3. Extensive retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy concerning for
metastatic disease.
4. Patchy sclerosis and anterior wedging of the T10 vertebral
body concerning for pathologic fracture. Evaluation for further
osseous lesions may be performed with a nuclear medicine bone
scan.

with preserved global and regional biventricular systolic
function. Mild -moderate mitral regurgitation. Pulmonary artery
mild systolic hypertension.

BONE SCAN [**2117-2-4**] IMPRESSION: Increased  tracer  activity  in
 the  T10  and  T11  vertebral  bodies  consistent  with
metastatic  disease activity.  Foci  of  mildly  increased
uptake  in  the  posterior left  T9  and  T10  ribs  consistent
with  rib  fracture.  No  tracer  uptake  in  the  right kidney.
