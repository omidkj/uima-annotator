10. Benign prostatic hypertrophy with incontinence, status
    post transurethral resection of the prostate.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1.  Digoxin 0.125.
2.  Lasix 80 mg p.o. q A.M., 40 mg p.o. q P.M.
3.  Toprol XL 100 mg daily.

5.  Protonix 40 mg daily.
6.  Flomax 0.8 mg q.h.s.
7.  Coumadin 2.5 mg daily.

PERTINENT LABORATORY RESULTS:
1.  Angiography performed on [**2148-3-6**] demonstrated an
    occluded right popliteal artery behind the knee. Peroneal
    artery reconstitutes and runs cleanly to a posterior
    tibial artery. Dorsalis pedis and anterior tibial
    arteries are occluded throughout.
2.  Angiography performed on [**2148-3-11**]: The right
    popliteal and peroneal arteries were angioplastied and
    stent was placed in the tibial peroneal trunk.

CONCISE SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted
to the vascular surgery service under Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1391**], was
initially started on broad spectrum antibiotics which
consisted of Vancomycin, levofloxacin and Flagyl. His home
Coumadin was held for awaiting intervention. He was started
on heparin subcutaneously. An angiogram was performed on
hospital day 2 following prehydration the night before. The
results are reported in the above section. The patient
tolerated the procedure well. There were no complications and
he returned to the floor. In the following 4 days the patient
was maintained on antibiotics and plans were made to
performed an interventional angiogram on [**2148-3-11**].
The patient was taken again to the angiography suite
following prehydration and a successful intervention was
performed with an angioplasty of the right popliteal and
peroneal arteries and stent placement in the tibial peroneal
trunk. The patient returned to the floor that evening with
his angio sheath in place. When the activated clotting time
was appropriate the sheath was pulled and pressure was held.
Several hours later the patient began complaining of some
pain in the right flank/hip area. His vital signs were stable
at this time. Stat hematocrit was sent. A short while later
the patient's blood pressure became unstable. He was
immediately transferred to the Intensive Care Unit where an
aggressive resuscitation was started including placing
central and peripheral IV access. The patient was then taken
to the operating room from the Intensive Care Unit after he
remained hemodynamically unstable despite blood and IV fluid
resuscitation. In the operating room he was placed on the
operating table. The abdomen and thighs were prepped and
draped in the usual sterile fashion. An angiogram was again
performed in the right common femoral artery in the
retrograde fashion. A somewhat brisk bleed from the distal
right iliac artery was noted. The sheath was somewhat
withdrawn and a 14 mm balloon was hand inflated in this area
until hemostasis was obtained. At this point a right oblique
flag incision was made into the retroperitoneum. Copious
amounts of clot and blood were evacuated from the right
retroperitoneum. At this point the patient hemodynamically
decompensated, went into first into a rapid response atrial
fibrillation and then a ventricular rhythm. Compressions were
begun at this point. Despite continued resuscitation the
patient became asystolic and did not respond. The patient was
pronounced at 2:15 A.M. on [**2148-3-12**]. There was no
active bleeding upon entering the abdomen but a significant
amount of old blood and clot were present.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Deceased.
