ascites

paracentesis

History of Present Illness:
This is a 58 y/o female with hemochromatosis and acute liver
failure as well as serratia bacteremia and acute renal failure
who is now transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further medical care and for
liver transplant evaluation.
Per d/c summary of OSH, patient was in good health until earlier
this summer when she had an acute GIB and hct drop to 23. At
that time, she was found to have ascites and liver failure.
Endoscopy showed duod ulcer. Liver workup not complete but
negative hep serologies. The patient was then seen in the office
and was noted to have cellulitis on the dorsum of the first
metatsarsal head. She was admitted for abcess drainage. She was
noted to have marked ascites, edema, LFT abnormalities and was
also worked up at this time.
On the first day of her hospitalization, her genetic test for
hemochromatosis was positive and was homozygous for C282Y.
Ferritin on [**8-22**] was 3939. Bilirubin has also been rising, to
2.2-4.3, now 2.2. Albumin was 2.0, fell as low as 1.6, and with
IV albumin improved to 2.9. During the time that she was treated
for the foot abcess, she had a lot of IVF and her weight
increased. Diuresis was attempted with aldactone and lasix but
was limited. She had 2 paracentesises with removal of 6 liters.
She went home but still had a low hct and was to begin iron
chelation therapy.
During the chelation therapy (Monday of last week), she
developed fever, rigor, chills, temp to 102.5 and "labile SBP"..
She was observed overnight and then discharged the following
day. The next day, her husband found her confused at home and on
admission, she was encephalopathic, with asterixis, and fever.
Her blood cultures 9/13 grew gram negative rods, serratia, pan
sensitive. She was started on Cipro. Diag paracentesis was
negative. Urine was negative. Source of bacteremia unclear. F/u
blood cultures have been negative.
She subsequently dropped her SBP and was transferred to the ICU
with a drop in her UOP. Diuretics were held but then
reinstituted when UOP still low and she got 160 mg lasix prior
to transfer. Her systolic bps had been in the 80s-90s. Central
line was placed today with CVP of 12, "renal dose" dopamine ws
started but stopped for tachycardia. Her Cr bumped to 3.0 from a
normal baseline.
Due to ongoing coagulopathy and anemia, has recieived at least 3
PRBCs, 3 FFP, 1 plt.
On transfer the patient is reluctant to answer questions.
Reports mouth is dry. Breathing is OK. No pain anywhere but just
doesn't want to talk anymore.

echo
IMPRESSION: Regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction c/w
multivessel CAD. Mild-moderate pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. Mild mitral regurgitation.
.
cxr
IMPRESSION:
1. Large amount of ascites.
.
2. Heterogeneous hepatic echo texture, consistent with the
patient's given history of hemachromatosis. No biliary
dilatation. Evaluation of the hepatic vasculature is markedly
limited due to patient inability to tolerate the examination.
.
3. Limited evaluation of the kidneys. Questionable focal scar in
the upper pole of the right kidney.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P:  58 F w/ recently diagnosed hemochromatosis and resulting
cirrhosis, with OSH course c/b ARF, worsening liver failure and
ascites, serratia bacteremia of unknown source.
.
1. Liver failure: MELD score is 28. Etiology of cirrhosis known
to be from hemochromatosis, was originally transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]
for tranplant workup, but has decompensated in the MICU, with
liver failure and HRS/renal failure.  Pt's family decided that
pt would like to be DNR/DNI, as well as made CMO on [**2141-10-2**].
-Admitted to floor from MICU in end stage liver failure, end
stage renal failure, CMO.  Will cont Morphine Drip, Ativan,
comfort measures.
.
.
.
During Hospitalization:
.
2. Renal failure: Differential of renal failure includes ATN
from borderline hypotension, AIN (on keflex), prerenal, HRS.
Renal U/S at OSH was normal.
-Foley in place. Follow UOP.
-U lytes, U eos, Uosms, look at sediment, SPEP/UPEP (renal
failure and anemia).
-Check CVP, if <[**10-25**] will bolus fluids, otherwise will hold off
pending studies
-Renal consult in AM.
.
3. Serratia bacteremia: Etiology of this unclear. Need to obtain
full micro data from OSH. Source may be foot which had
concerning features of osteo at OSH film, urine (was negative),
lung, heart. Will need at least 2 week course for bacteremia but
if related to an osteo, would need longer course.
-Continue Levofloxacin, Will not double cover for now especially
as patient stable and afebrile but can d/w ID in AM as serratia
a resistant bacteria.
-UA/Ucx, Bld cx (surveillance and obtain OSH results), CXR
-Consider echo (will likely need as part of transplant eval
-Will obtain left foot x rays. Can d/w podiatry asneeded.
.
4. Hypothyroidism: Will check a TSH here. Was started on IV
levothyroxine there for unclear reasons though perhaps they felt
her MS could be explained by this. Will start PO levothyroxine
for now, 75 mcg (average dose for her weight).
.
5. Anemia: Unclear source of anemia. Guiac all stools. Send type
and screen. Iron studies sent. SPEP/UPEP for anemia/renal
failure. Cont PPI.
-Tfuse >21 unless actively breathing.
.
6. Anion Gap Metabolic Acidosis: Unclear etiology. Likely
related to renal failure. Will also send venous lactate and
follow closely. If gap increasing, will obtain ABG.
.
7. Coagulopathy: INR 1.7 for now. FFP for procedures as needed.
Got vit K at OSH.
-Transfuse plts >10.
.
8. FEN: POs as tolerated, 2 g Na diet. Fluid restriction if
needed.
.
9. Foot: Check foot films on left, will continue for possible
osteomyelitis with
keflex, renall dosed. Had two week course per chart.
.
10. ?DM: Often seen in hemochromatosis but A1C was 4.1 at OSH.
FS QID with ISS.
.
11. PPX: pneumoboots, PPI
.

13. Husband: [**Name (NI) **] work [**Telephone/Fax (3) 62531**] Home [**Telephone/Fax (3) 62532**]
