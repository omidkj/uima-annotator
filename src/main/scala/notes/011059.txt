Pertinent Results:
CT PELVIS W/O CONTRAST
IMPRESSION:
1. Extensive right acetabular fracture involving the right
anterior and
posterior walls and columns and medial wall with extension into
the right
iliac bone. There is likely a small chip fracture fragment in
the right hip joint space.
2. Right superior pubic ramus spiral fracture and right inferior
pubic ramus segmental fracture.
3. Asymmetric hyperdensity and enlargement of the right
obturator externus
and right iliacus muscles consistent with intramuscular hematoma
and muscle injury adjacent to fracture sites. Mild enlargement
of the right gluteus medius and minimus muscles consistent with
muscle injury.
4. Soft tissue stranding and mild hyperdensity in the
pre-vesicular space is concerning for either hemorrhage and/or
extraperitoneal bladder injury, which may be masked with Foley
catheter in place. Consider cystographic study for assessment of
bladder integrity.
5. Degenerative changes and chondrocalcinosis involving the left
hip joint
and pubic symphysis, suggesting CPPD.
6. Sacroiliac joint degenerative disease bilaterally without
signs of
diastasis.

CT PELVIS W/CONTRAST
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence for intra- or extraperitoneal bladder leak.
2. Unchanged appearance to the both column right acetabular
fracture.
Unchanged superior and inferior pubic ramus fractures. Stable
pelvic and
intramuscular hematomas


Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to the Orthopedic service on [**2153-10-3**]
for right acetabular fracture after being evaluated in the
emergency room.  She was
initially scheduled for surgery on [**2153-11-02**] but was hypotensive
and was kept under observation in the ICU until she became
hemodynamically stable with transfusion of 2 units of packed red
blood cells and one unit of fresh frozen plasme.  She underwent
open reduction internal fixation of the right acetabulum without
complication on [**2153-10-4**] after being evaluated as stable for the
operation. She was extubated without difficulty and transferred
to the recovery room in stable condition.  In the early
post-operative course Ms. did well and was transferred to the
floor in stable condition.

On hospital day [**2153-10-4**], [**2153-10-6**], and [**2153-10-7**] she was transfused
one unit of packed red blood cells for post-operative anemia. on
[**2153-10-5**] she received a fluid bolus for post-operative
hypotension.

She had adequate pain management and worked with physical
therapy while in the hospital.  The remainder of her hospital
course was uneventful and Ms. [**Known lastname **] is being discharged to
rehab on [**2153-10-9**] in stable condition.
