Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1505**]
Chief Complaint:
Increasing angina

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2184-8-3**] Four vessel coronary artery bypass grafting utilizing
left internal mammary artery to left anterior descending; vein
grafts to right coronary artery, obtuse marginal and diagonal.
[**2184-8-2**] Cardiac catheterization with insertion of IABP


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] has a known history of dilated cardiomyopathy, with an
EF of 20%. Previous workup at [**Hospital3 **] Hospital in [**2179**]
showed a large area of infarct involving the apex, anteroseptal
and inferobasal wall on Cardiolite study. Viability studies at
that time revealed no viability in the apex and anteroseptal
wall but there was viability in the inferior wall. An
echocardiogram in [**2180**] showed an LVEF of 20% with mild mitral
and tricsupid regurgitation.

During this past year the patient has been experiencing chest
pressure that occurs with exertion such as during sexual
intercourse or when he is emotionally stressed (ex. when he is
gambling).  His chest pain is relieved with nitroglycerin.  The
pain does not radiate to his arm or jaw.  He denies any DOE, but
does get SOB when he lays himself flat or on his left side.  He
sleeps with 2 pillows at night.  Denies lower extremity edema,
palpitations, dizziness, difficulty with erection, or
claudication.

Past Medical History:
Dilated cardiomyopathy, Hypertension, Chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease - active smoker, Mild mitral regurgitation

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was admitted and underwent elective cardiac
catheterization which was significant for severe three vessel
disease with severely depressed left ventricular function.
Coronary angiography showed a right dominant system with complex
90% lesion in the left anterior descending involving a large
diagonal; 70% stenosis of the first obtuse marginal and 70%
stenosis of the mid right coronary artery. Left ventriculography
showed 2+ mitral regurgitation and a LVEF of 15-20%. Based on
the above results, an IABP was placed to augment diastolic
coronary filling. Cardiac surgery was subsequently consulted for
urgent surgical coronary revascularization. Further evaluation
included a TTE which confirmed a dilated left ventricule and
severe global left ventricular hypokinesis with relative
thinning/akinesis of the antero-septum and anterior walls. The
LVEF was estimated at 20%; and there was only 1+ mitral
regurgiation. The aortic valve was normal. He otherwise remained
pain free on medical therapy and was cleared to proceed with
surgery. Given the IABP, he was maintained on intravenous
Heparin.

On [**8-3**], Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] performed four vessel coronary artery
bypass grafting utilizing left internal mammary artery to left
anterior descending; with vein grafts to right coronary artery,
obtuse marginal and diagonal. His operative course was
uneventful and he transferred to the CSRU for further invasive
monitoring. Due to a postoperative coagulopathy and copious
amounts of airway secretions, he remained intubated and sedated
for several days. His bleeding eventually improved with multiple
blood products and required no operative intervention. He went
on to experience bouts of paroxsymal atrial fibrillation which
was treated with Amiodarone. The IABP was removed on
postoperative day four. He maintained stable hemodynamics as he
successfully weaned from inotropic support. He was eventually
extubated on postoperative day six following
diagnostic/therapeutic bronchoscopy. Sputum cultures eventually
grew out Klebsiella pneumoniae and MRSA for which antibiotic
therapy was adjsted accordingly. A PICC line was placed for
intravenous Vancomycin while he was concomitantly placed on
contact precautions. Following extubation, he continued to
require aggressive chest physiotherapy and suctioning. With
diuresis, pulmonary toilet and antibiotics, his pulmonary status
gradually improved. Due to concern for aspiration, a bedside
swallow study was performed on [**8-11**]. This showed a normal,
functional swallow with no signs of aspiration. On postoperative
day nine, he transferred to the SDU.

His pulmonary status continued to improve. By discharge, his
secretions were significantly less and he was satting 96% on
room air. Just prior to discharge, the PICC line was removed and
Vancomycin was discontinued. He will need to remain on
Levofloxacin for another two weeks. He remained in a normal
sinus rhythm with first degree AV block - no further atrial
arrhythmias were noted. Amiodarone was titrated accordingly. He
maintained stable hemodynamics and tolerated an ACEI. Given his
depressed LV function, he will need to remain on an ACEI as an
outpatient. He continued to make clinical improvements, and was
eventually discharged to home on postoperative day 13.
