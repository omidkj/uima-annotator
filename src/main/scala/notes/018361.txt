Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 443**]
Chief Complaint:
chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac catheterization with angioplasty and drug eluting stent
to left main coronary artery and left anterior descending artery


History of Present Illness:
83 yo with hx of AS s/p bioprosthetic AVR x 2, RIMA to RCA in
[**7-/2130**] presented to [**Hospital3 17921**] Center on [**1-12**] with CP. She
reported worsening of indeigestion with heartburn X 2 weeks with
the episodes of [**2145-1-20**] dull chest discomfort becoming more
constant. She was put on a PPI by her PCP without effect. Over
several days her sxs have become worse with burning chest
discomfort without associated SOB. She has 6 pillow orthopnea
from 3 due to worse sxs at night. Her chest discomfort is worse
with activity. Day prior ([**1-11**]) to admission she developed
severe heartburn and CP which radiated to both arms with
numbness and tingling of both arms as well. It was associated
with SOB, diaphoresis, lightheadedness, and eventual vomiting.
She has also had increasing fatigue and weakness. She called EMS
at that point and was relieved with oxygen.
.
Initial OSH EKG showed: old RBBB with new TWI in V2-V3 and III
and increased diffuse ST depressions. ST elevations in aVR.
Initial troponin was 0.1 which increased to 1.85 on [**1-13**] at
720am. She was started on IV heparin on the am of [**1-12**].
.
Patient had CP at 330 am on [**1-13**] relieved by increasing nitro
gtt.
Cardiac catheterization on [**1-13**] showed 98% discrete distal left
main disease, 90% proximal/mid/distal RCA, patent RIMA-distal
RCA, 85% mid right external iliac stenosis. LAD and circumflex
were poorly visualized. She was started on a nitro gtt, high
dose liptor, lopressor and norvasc. She was given Lasix IV for
evidence of CHF on CXR and an elevated BNP to 2810. She is +1.2
L due to IVF for renal protection.
.
She had a Hct drop from 34 to 28 which was rechecked and 24 on
day of transfer. Her creatinine was elevated at 1.8 (basline
unknown).
.
On the floor, patient had developed [**9-26**] chest discomfort while
on a heparin gtt and nitro gtt, which could not be put to max
dose due to limitations to what can be administered on the
general wards. The patient's chest discomfort relived on its
own.
.
Additionally, patient was found to have BRBPR on rectal
examination, although no bloody bowel movements.
.
On transfer, patient is CP free.

.
[**2145-1-14**] ECG: Normal sinus rhythm, rate 78. Right bundle branch
block. Non-specific inferolateral repolarization changes. No
previous tracing available for comparison.
.
[**2145-1-14**] Arterial duplex lower extremity u/s: There is
significant calcified plaque bilaterally within the right and
left common femoral and superficial femoral arterial
distributions, now with elevated velocities within the
superficial femoral arteries bilaterally.
.
[**2145-1-14**] CT abdomen pelvis: 1. No evidence of retroperitoneal
hemorrhage.
2. Multiple well-circumscribed bilateral renal lesions, some of
which may
represent simple cysts, though with some incompletely
characterized and
correlation with prior imaging is recommended, and if no prior
imaging is
available, a renal ultrasound can be performed on a non-emergent
basis for
further evaluation. 3. Extensive atherosclerotic calcification
and disease with associated luminal narrowing that is
incompletely assessed on this non-contrast imaging study.
.
[**2145-1-15**] TTE: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
normal global and regional biventricular systolic function.
Aortic valve bioprosthesis with thickened leaflets and
abnormally-elevated gradients. Mild calcific mitral stenosis.
Moderate to severe mitral regurgitation. Moderate tricuspid
regurgitation. Moderate pulmonary hypertension.
.
[**2145-1-18**] Cardiac catheterization: 1. Limited coronary angiography
in this right dominant system demonstrated three vessel disease.
The LMCA had a distal 90% stenosis. The LAD had a 90% mid vessel
stenosis. The RCA was not injected. 2. Abdominal aortography
revealed mild bilateral renal artery stenosis. The iliac
arteries were severely calcified and tortuous with a 70% right
and 60% left common iliac stenosis. 3. Successful PTCA and
stenting of the LMCA with a 4.5 x 13mm Ultra bare metal stent
which was postdilated to 5.0mm. Final angiography revealed no
residual stenosis, no angiographically apparent dissection, and
TIMI 3 flow. 4. Successful PTCA and stenting of the mid LAD with
a 3.0 x 15mm Vision bare metal stent which was postdilated to
3.5mm. Final angiography revealed no residual stenosis, no
angiographically apparent dissection, and TIMI 3 flow.
.
Renal Ultrasound [**2145-1-22**]
IMPRESSION:
1. Bilateral simple cysts measuring up to 1.7 cm.
2. Number of echogenic foci in the lower pole of the left
kidney, the largest
measuring 0.6 cm consistent with stone.
3. Bilateral small amount of pleural effusion.
4. Small amount of ascites.


Brief Hospital Course:
83 year-old female with past medical history of AS, CAD s/p 1V
[**Hospital **] transferred from OSH with 98% left main disease s/p BMS to
LMCA and mid LAD.  She was transferred back to [**Hospital **] hospital in
[**Location (un) 3844**] on [**2145-1-22**] for further care because it is closer to
home, so that her family can visit her more easily.

#. CAD: The patient presented from an outside hospital with
severe left main stenosis of 98%. The patient underwent a
catheterization at the outside hospital. She was transfused 1u
pRBC to a goal of 30. She was weaned off the nitroglycerin drip
and her blood pressures were controlled with metoprolol tartrate
and hydralazine. She was on high dose atorvastatin. She had back
pain and had a CT abdomen and pelvis which
