Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2387**]
Chief Complaint:
OSH transfer for cardiogenic shock

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac Catheterization with POBA to OM1 and no stents

History of Present Illness:
74M with h/o OSA on CPAP, HLD, HTN and no known cardiac history
confirmed with partner and family, admitted to [**Name (NI) 8125**] on for
spinal surgery [**1-9**] severe spinal stenosis, had L3-L5 laminectomy
with decompression on [**8-19**]. On [**8-21**] (POD #2) pt was difficult to
arouse at 6:30am.  RN removed CPAP (for OSA) -> resp distress
with SaO2 70-80s, hypotensive, and unresponsive -> given 40mg IV
Lasix, intubated and transferred to ICU.  In ICU given more
lasix.  Then at 9:00 PEA code called, CPR x5 mins with 1mg Epi,
Dopamine, and Phenylephrine started. Pt returned to sinus rhythm
within 10 minutes with BP 120s/60s. OGT placed and EKG was done
that was interpreted as RV Infarct prompting transfer.
- CXR was done that showed Right lung white out and left lung
pulm edema.
- Bedside echocardiogram was performed which demonstrated
inferobasal and posterior wall hypokinesis and an LV ejection
fraction of 45-50%. The right ventricle was mildly dilated with
moderate hypokinesis. Estimated pulmonary artery pressure was 35
mmHg.
.
On transfer here, the pt was intubated, was put on phenylephrine
and dopamine and given a 3000U Heparin bolus.
.
OSH Labs showed Trop 4.21  BNP 232  wbc 19 plt 428, INR 1.1  Crt
0.9  Gluc 188.
.
In [**Hospital1 18**] Cath Lab - Bolused with Heparin 2000U, ASA 325, no
plavix.
Results showed: (1) LCx 90% stenosis, (2) 99% OM1 stenosis, with
POBA to OM1 no stents.

ECHO [**8-21**]:
The left ventricle is not well seen. Right ventricular chamber
size is normal. with borderline normal free wall function. The
aortic valve is not well seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. The mitral valve leaflets are not well seen.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is a trivial/physiologic
pericardial effusion. There is an anterior space which most
likely represents a prominent fat pad.
IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Limited study. Mild
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
.
ECHO [**8-22**]:
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion
abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF 70%). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve
is not well seen. Aortic stenosis is present (not quantified).
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a
prominent fat pad.

Brief Hospital Course:
74 yo male with PEA arrest and NSTEMI (LCx/OM1) on POD #2 after
spinal surgery at OSH.  He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] and admitted
to the CCU.
.
# Hypoxic Respiratory Failure : Patient developed hypoxic
respiratory failure, likely secondary to aspiration pneumonia
vs. pneumonitis. He was intubated and ventilated on ARDS net
protocol.  He was treated with vancomycin and Zosyn.  We
diuresed the patient >1L net negative per day.  On [**8-25**], the
patient was extubated.  He did well from a respiratory
stand-point following extubation.  He continued to have an
elevated WBC count during his hospital stay, likely due to
resolving pneumonitis.  It was 18 on [**8-29**].  He was afebrile and
otherwise without eviden
