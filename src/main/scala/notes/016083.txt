Chief Complaint:
Peri-procedure [**First Name3 (LF) **]

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Atrial tachycardia ablation
Left knee tap and injection
Pulmonary intubation


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 26818**] is a 62 year old man with ischemic cardiomyopathy,
pulmonary hypertension, CABG/MVR [**8-/2182**], LAA clot on warfarin
who is admitted after EP ablation for symptomatic atrial
tachycardia.
.
Mr. [**Known lastname 28510**] primary problem has been chronic atrial tachycardia
since [**2182-9-5**], resulting in fatigue, lightheadedness,
palpitations, DOE, and chest pain with exertion. Today, [**4-16**], a
catheter ablation procedure was performed. This revealed two
discreet macroreentrant atrial tachycardias:  One was mapped to
the left atrial septum, and the second was typical flutter
around the tricuspid annulus. With ablation of the second focus,
the patient converted to sinus rhythm. The procedure was
tolerated well under general anesthesia until the period after
restoration of sinus rhythm, when he became hypotensive. It was
suspected that his hypotension was secondary to blood loss after
his hematocrit dropped from 43 to 38 to 32 to 29 during the
procedure. Intracardiac echo and transthoracic echo revealed no
pericardial effusion. All vascular access was via the femoral
veins; there was no arterial puncture for the procedure. The
patient was sent to CT scan from the EP lab before arriving in
the CCU.
.
On arrival to the CCU, the patient was intubated and sedated on
dopamine gtt, phenylephrine gtt, epinephrine gtt.
.
ROS: unable to perform secondary to inutbation/sedation

CT ABD & PELVIS W/O CONTRAST ([**2183-4-16**])
1. Large retroperitoneal hematoma extending from the right
anterior pararenal space down into the extraperitoneal space of
Retzius as well as into the subperitoneal pelvis bilaterally,
greater on the right than the left. There is no evidence of
intraperitoneal hemorrhage.
2. Right lower lobe opacities likely representative of
developing pneumonia, possibly due to aspiration. Otherwise,
there is no evidence of hemorrhage in the thorax.
3. Stable right renal hemorrhagic cyst.


Brief Hospital Course:
62 year old man with ischemic cardiomyopathy, pulmonary
hypertension, CABG/MVR [**8-/2182**], LAA clot on warfarin who was
admitted to the CCU for hypovolemic [**Year (4 digits) **] after EP ablation for
symptomatic atrial tachycardia, found to have a retroperitoneal
bleed.

ACUTE
# Hypovolemic [**Year (4 digits) 21020**]:
He was found to be hypotensive toward the end of his EP ablation
procedure. He was sent directly to the CT scanner, where he was
found to have a large retroperitoneal hematoma. On arrival to
the CCU, the patient was already intubated and sedated on
dopamine gtt, phenylephrine gtt, epinephrine gtt. He was
transfused 6 units of PRBCs over the course of his first 2 days
in the CCU. Given his coagulopathy from warfarin, this was
reversed with a total of 6 units FFP. Dopamine and epi were
quickly discontinued, and phenylephrine was weaned over the
first couple days. He remained hemodynamically stable without
further evidence of bleeding.

# Ischemic cardiomyopathy / chronic systolic CHF / CAD:
His most recent EF is 25%.  He was monitored very closely for
heart failure given the large amount of blood products and
fluids that were given. Intubation was continued given his high
risk for pulmonary edema. Diuretics and anti-hypertensives were
held, as well as aspirin given his bleed. When stable his
sildenafil, spironolactone, torsemide and digoxin were
restarted. As renal function improves, consider starting low
dose ACE inhibitor.

# Intubation:
This was performed electively pre-procedure. He remained
intubated for the first day in the CCU, then was quickly
extubated.

# Gout
He was found to have swelling and tenderness in his left knee on
[**4-20**]. This was tapped, which showed 17k WBCs and
monosodium urate crystals, consistent with gout. He has no
history of gout. He was started on colchicine and rheumatology
was consulted to perform a steroid injection in his knee. This
improved his pain significantly.

CHRONIC
# Chronic Kidney Disease:
Baseline creatinine of 1.8 which was stable.

# Atrial tachycardia:
Ablation was performed by EP, with subsequent resultant sinus
rhythm. INR initially reversed, then warfarin was restarted when
stable.  He rermained in NSR for the duration of the
hospitalization.

# Pulmonary hypertension: Holding home sildenafil in setting of
[**Month (only) **]. Restarted when stable.

# DM, type II, insulin dependent:
Sliding scale humalong. Restarted home lantus when tolerating PO

# Hyperlipidemia:
Continued statin when tolerating PO

TRANSITIONAL
-- Consider starting allopurinol for maintenance prevention of
gout flares.
-- Monitor warfarin and INR given left atrial appendage clot.
-- Consider starting ACEi as renal function improves.
