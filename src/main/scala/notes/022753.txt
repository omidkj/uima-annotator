Service:  ACOVE

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
Cholangitis.

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Chest pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a [**Age over 90 **] year-old man with a
history of sick sinus syndrome, cerebrovascular accident,
hypertension who presented with epigastric and lower chest
pain.  The sensation was described as heavy, but was without
shortness of breath, nausea, vomiting or radiation.  The
patient was ruled out for myocardial infarction and had a
troponin peak of 15.4, but CKMB was within normal limits and
cardiology reviewed the electrocardiogram concluding that it
was not an myocardial infarction.  Lumbar puncture was
negative.  Liver function tests were found to be negative
with AST equalling 359, ALT equaling 258.  The patient
underwent endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, but
became hypoxic and hypoventilated during the procedure.  The
procedure was aborted and the patient went to the Intensive
Care Unit for monitoring and respiratory support on a
nonrebreather mask.  The patient was also found to be anemic
with a hematocrit of 25.6 and so received 1 unit of packed
red blood cells.  The patient was found on chest x-ray to
have pneumonia.  Given both the cholangitis and the pneumonia
the patient was started on Levaquin and Flagyl as well as
Ampicillin.  Subsequently the patient's vital signs remained
stable and transferred to [**Hospital **] Medical Service for further
medical management.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Cerebrovascular accident in [**2161**],
atrial fibrillation on Coumadin and bradycardia status post
pacer placement in [**2144**] as well as hypertension.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Notable for no coronary artery disease.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  No alcohol or tobacco.  The patient is
Bulgarian born.  He speaks Bulgarian, Russian and English.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

OUTPATIENT MEDICATIONS:  Metoprolol 25 mg po b.i.d., Coumadin
50 mg po t.i.d. taken on Monday, Wednesday and Friday and
12.5 mg taken on Sunday, Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday.

HOSPITAL COURSE ON THE ACOVE SERVICE:  The patient was
medically managed.  Bowel rest was obtained by having the
patient first NPO and then on clears and thick liquids only
as well as supportive management with intravenous fluid
hydration prn and gentle diuresis to maintain fluid balance
for maintaining clear lungs.  Tachycardia was noted so the
patient was put back on a beta blocker.  The patient
continued to improve clinically with decreased abdominal
pain, normalized liver function tests.  Blood cultures came
back positive for Enterobacter cloacae that was Levaquin
sensitivity, so Ampicillin and Flagyl were discontinued.  The
decision was made to then hold off repeating the endoscopic
retrograde cholangiopancreatography for at least another
month to allow the patient to recover and compensate and then
to arrange an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography
as an outpatient.

The plan, therefore is to discharge the patient to a rehab
facility and follow up endoscopic retrograde
cholangiopancreatography in about a month.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  1.  Levofloxacin 500 mg po q day for
seven more days, net fourteen days treatment with weekly
surveillance cultures for the next four weeks.  2.  Coumadin
50 mg po q.h.s. on Monday, Wednesday and Friday and then 12.5
mg po q.h.s. on Sunday, Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday.  INR
should be checked daily starting on [**11-23**] and
readjusting dosing with target INR goal of 2.5.  Once the
goal is reached INR should be checked at least weekly.  3.
Tylenol 650 mg po q 6 hours prn.  4.  Metoprolol 75 mg po
b.i.d.  5.  Furosemide 20 mg po q day.  Potassium, BUN and
creatinine should be checked every three to four days.  Hold
doses until values normalize if potassium level is replete.
4.  Captopril 37.5 mg po t.i.d. holding for systolic blood
pressures of less then 100.  5.  Albuterol nebulizers one
nebulizer every four hours prn.  6.  Enoxaparin 50 mg subQ q
