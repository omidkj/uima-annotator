Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Sulfa (Sulfonamides)

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2181**]
Chief Complaint:
weakness, SOB, orthostatic hypotension

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
s/p wound closure in OR


History of Present Illness:
64yo M w/ PMH of CAD and cryptogenic cirrhosis s/p 3v CABG and
simultaneous liver transplant in [**4-3**], with a post-op course
complicated by peritonitis, sternal wound infection, ? MI, and
orthostatic hypotension. Completed a [**Hospital 11728**] rehab program at
[**Hospital3 7**] which had enabled him to walk again and get
back on his feet. He was doing well until 3-4 weeks ago when he
developed progressive fatigue, SOB, and postural hypotension
(he'd get lightheaded when standing quickly). His sx began to
get worse over the last week. He fell at home last Wednesday,
landing on his R side and injuring his ribs. EMS was called but
the pt refused transport to the ER at that time. He denied LOC,
no head trauma, no bleeding. His SOB has begun to occur at rest,
while he's sitting in a chair. He is asx when laying flat (no
LH, no SOB).
.
He experienced this previously while hospitalized in [**State 108**],
but felt he had been doing better up until now. At that time, he
was started on midadrine once daily. He was then started on
lasix, and then coreg. Over the last month, coreg and lasix have
had to be discontinued, and his outpt provider has gradually
gone up on his midadrine to his current dose, 10mg PO TID, with
no improvement in his sx (if anything, his sx have gotten
worse).
.
ROS:
denies fevers, chills, night sweats or weight loss
denies URI sx of rhinorrhea, cold, sinus congestion; + cough
productive of clear sputum
denies dysphagia, difficulty swallowing, or odynophagia
denies anorexia, abdominal pain, n/v/d/constipation
denies numbness or tingling in his hands or feet
+ mild swelling in his toes [**1-31**] [**Male First Name (un) **] stockings
+ black stools since starting Fe supplements
+ cloudy urine, denies dysuria, decreased urinary frequency
+ "funny feeling" in his back, in his kidney area
denies back pain

.
CXR [**2126-4-8**] - No evidence of CHF or pneumonia.
.
CT head [**2126-4-8**] - No intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect.
.
RENAL US [**2126-4-9**] - Re-demonstration of large right renal cyst.
Otherwise, unremarkable renal ultrasound without evidence of
hydronephrosis.
.
ECHO [**2126-4-12**] -  The left atrium is elongated. No atrial septal
defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or
saline contrast with maneuvers. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is mildly
dilated. There is severe global left ventricular hypokinesis
(ejection fraction 20-30 percent). No masses or thrombi are seen
in the left ventricle. There is no ventricular septal defect.
Right ventricular chamber size is normal. Right ventricular
systolic function appears depressed. The aortic root is
moderately dilated. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The
aortic arch
is moderately dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally
normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no
mitral valve prolapse.  Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. The pulmonary artery systolic  pressure could not be
determined. There is no pericardial effusion.  Compared with the
findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2125-12-14**], the left ventricular ejection fraction is further reduced.


KUB [**2126-4-19**]: Gas is present within a prominent transverse colon,
but air in soles present throughout the colon.  There is no
evidence for obstruction.  Findings are most consistent with
ileus.  Degenerative disease is present throughout the lumbar
spine.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 9035**] is a 64yo man status post 3V CABG and concurrent
liver transplant last year in [**Location 14660**] FL, complicated by
sternal wound infection. He presented to cardiology clinic for
the first time with weakness, shortness of breath, and
orthostatic hypotension and was admitted to the inpatient
medicine service.
.
ORTHOSTATIC HYPOTENSION: The etiology of his symptoms were
unclear on admission. Our differential was broad and included
autonomic neuropathy secondary to DM, deconditioning given his
long ICU stay, and dehydration. He was given IVF for 48 hrs
which improved his orthostasis, but began to lead to volume
overload, with slight pedal edema and crackles on lung exam.
Neurology was consulted for the evaluation of his autonomic
dysfunction. A tilt table test was performed and found him to
have true orthostatic hypotension, likely multifactorial in
etiology.  We continued his home midodrine and increased his
dose to 12.5mg qam, 10mg at noon and 10mg at 4pm.  He was also
started on florinef daily, then increased to [**Hospital1 **] to aid with his
orthostasis.  We encouraged the patient to wear TEDS stockings
around the clock as well as keeping his bed in reverse
Trendelenberg, however hte patient refused to wear 24 hour TEDS
stockings, repeatedly insisting that he take them off to sleep
at night for comfort.  The patient remained orthostatic
throughout his stay, with some days better than others although
with no clear precipitants for these differences. We ultimately
encouraged that he dirnk caffeine as well, up to three times per
day to aid with his orthostasis.  He was able to walk with PT
with a walker prior to discharge, but continued to rep
