Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1145**]
Chief Complaint:
Transfer from OSH for acute MI.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac catheterization [**2188-3-4**]
Percutaneous coronary angioplasty

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 37217**] is a [**Age over 90 **] year-old female with CV risk factor of age
and hypertension, with a past medical history also significant
for lung cancer status post resection, remote colon cancer
status post resection, and hypothyroidism, who presented to
[**Hospital3 **] on [**2188-3-4**] with acute left-sided chest pain.

She notes that she developed a tooth ache 1 day prior to
admission. Then at 1100 AM on the day of presentation, she
developed acute left-sided chest pain, severe, with radiation to
the back. She denies associated SOB, no N/V. No prior similar
episode.

At the OSH, initial vitals were T 95, BP 124/75, HR 78, RR 18,
Sat 98% on room air. EKG revealed ST elevations in V1-4. She was
given 4 baby aspirins, [**Name (NI) **] 150 mg PO X 1, Lopressor 2.5 mg IV
X 3, then Heparin bolus 1400 units then drip 400 cc/ hour. She
was also started on a NTG drip at 70 mcg/min. She was never
chest pain free at the OSH and was emergently transferred to the
[**Hospital1 18**] for cardiac catheterization.

Past Medical History:
1. Lung cancer (adenocarcinoma, stage 1) diagnosed in [**2182**],
status post resection.
2. History of colon cancer 10 years ago, status post resection
3. Hypothyroidism
4. History of compression fracture

Social History:
She is widowed, and lives alone. She has no children. She has a
visiting nurse who comes three times a week, and helps her with
house chores and groceries. She ambulates without assistance,
but has a history of prior falls. She never smoked, no EtOH.

Family History:
Mother with CAD at advanced age.

COMMENTS:
1.  Coronary angiography of this right dominant system revealed
single
vessel coronary artery disease.  The left main coronary artery
had a 40%
ostial stenosis.  The LAD had a total occlusion of the proximal
vessel.
The LCX had minimal disease.  The RCA had serial stenoses in the
mid and
distal vessel.
2.  Resting hemodynamics were performed.  Right sided pressures
were
mildly elevated (mean RA pressure was 9 mm Hg and RVEDP was 12
mm Hg). Pulmonary artery pressures were moderately elevated (PA
pressure was 44/24 mm Hg).  Left sided pressures were severely
elevated (mean PCWP was 27 mm Hg).  Cardiac index was low (at 2
L/min/m2).
3.  Successful PCI of the LAD-D1 with a 2.5 x 23 mm Cypher [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **]
[**Last Name (Prefixes) 5177**]
from the proximal LAD into D1 with rescue of the LAD ostium with
a 2.5
mm balloon.
4.  Successful closure of right femoral arteriotomy with a 6
French
AngioSeal device.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Severe single vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Severely elevated left sided pressures.
3. Successful PCI of LAD with DES.

**************
[**2188-3-4**] CXR: AP single view of the chest has been obtained with
the patient in supine position. The heart is enlarged with a
prominence of the left ventricular contour to the left. The
thoracic aorta is widened and elongated and shows calcium
deposits in the wall mostly at the level of the arch. A catheter
approached from below passes through the right heart and
terminates in the central portion of the left main PA. There is
no pneumothorax or any other placement related complication. The
accessible lung fields demonstrate a pulmonary vasculature,
which is irregular in distribution consistent with COPD. There
is no conclusive evidence for pulmonary edema on the left side;
however, on the right side a perivascular haze is present and
the right lateral pleural sinus is blunted. Diffuse density over
the entire lower portion of the right hemithorax is indicative
of pleural effusion layering posteriorly. Some pleural effusion
is also present on the left side but to a lesser degree.

In the hilar region one can identify multiple centrally located
surgical clips indicative of previous surgery, nature is
unknown. There is no evidence of any external wiring.

Diffuse skeletal demineralization is noted, and there is at
least one vertebral body with significant compression in the
lower thoracic spine.

There exists no prior chest examination or records available for
comparison.

IMPRESSION: Left ventricular enlargement, bilateral pleural
effusion more marked on the right, pulmonary emphysema pattern
probably interferes with assessment of pulmonary vasculature on
the radiograph. Suggest correlation with findings on Swan-Ganz
catheter to determine degree of left-sided fitting pressure
elevation.

********************
[**2188-3-5**] ECHO: The left atrium is normal in size. Left
ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular
cavity size is normal. There is severe regional left ventricular
systolic dysfunction. Overall left ventricular systolic function
is severely depressed (20%). Resting regional wall motion
abnormalities include mid to distal anteroseptal and apical
akinesis with hypokinesis elsewhere. No apical thrombus
identified but cannot exclude. Right ventricular chamber size
and free wall motion are normal (although apex not fully
visualized). The aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened.
There is no aortic valve stenosis. Moderate (2+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are moderately
thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate to severe [3+]
tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial
effusion.

[**2188-3-13**] ECHO (preliminary report): No pericardial effusion. No
LV thrombus.

Brief Hospital Course:
[**Age over 90 **] year-old female with CV risk factors of HTN and age, with a
PMHx also significant for lung cancer and colon cancer both
status post resection, now admitted with AMI, found to have TO
of LAD, status post stent/PTCA on [**2188-3-4**].

1) Anterior MI: As mentioned above, Ms. [**Known lastname 37217**] was taken
directly to the cath lab. Coronary angiography revealed total
occlusion of the LAD, and stenting of the LAD into OM1 was
performed, with res
