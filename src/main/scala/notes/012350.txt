Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 602**]
Chief Complaint:
Hypoxia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none


History of Present Illness:
A 60 year old male with PMH HTN, COPD, and Alcoholism presented
to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED with dyspnea and cough and was admitted to the
ICU for hypoxia.

History obtained primairly from ExWife who is at bedside. She
reports that for the past month, the patient has been having
worseing dyspnea on exertion. Two days prior to admission, she
reports that he had increasing sputum production and dyspnea, he
was somnolent and spent >16 hours sleeping each day. On the day
of admission, she noted confusion, though he usually speaks with
her in English, he began only speaking in Hindi which she does
not speak.

In the ED initial vitals were 98.7, 107, 125/68, 40 and 70 on
RA, he was triggered for hypoxia. Initial labs were remarkable
for HCT 44.0, WBC 9.7 PMN 76%, INR 1.4, Cr 1.1, Lactate 2.6, BNP
3272. Chest xray showed BL (L>R) pleural effusions and pulmonary
edema. According to the report, exam was remarkable for
abdomiinal distention however ultrasound examination failed to
identify ascitic fluid collection.

Initial ABG showed 7.31/69/76/36 on 15L (unclear O2 delivery) he
was placed on BiPAP with 50% FiO2 repeat ABG showed
7.33/65/74/36.He was given Albuterol and ipratropium nebulizer
treatements, 500mg Azithromycin, Ceftriaxone 1g IV, and
Methylprednisolone 125mg IV x1.

ABG shortly prior to transfer showed 7.39/55/58/35. Vitals on
transfer BP157/72 RR24 SaO293% on BiPAP PEEP of 8

On arrival to the ICU, initial vitals were BP 127/70 HR:80 RR:19
90% on a 50% ventimask. He was agitated, pulling at lines and
his foley and demanding to get out of bed. He stated that his
last alcoholic drink was 2 days ago which his ExWife confirmed.

Review of systems:

Notable studies:
ECHO [**2125-11-26**]:
Poor image quality. The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial
septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size
and global systolic function (LVEF>55%). Regional left
ventricular wall motion is normal. There is no ventricular
septal defect. The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated
with normal free wall contractility. There is abnormal septal
motion/position. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The
aortic valve is not well seen. There is no aortic valve
stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are not well seen. No mitral regurgitation is seen.
Tricuspid regurgitation is present but cannot be quantified. The
pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a
prominent fat pad.

CXR [**2125-11-26**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. Bibasilar consolidation, left greater than right, and
moderate left
pleural effusion, may represent infection in the appropriate
clinical setting.
2. Moderate cardiomegaly and/or pericardial effusion. Mild
pulmonary edema.

LE Ultrasound [**2125-11-26**]:
IMPRESSION:
No left or right lower extremity DVT.

RUQ Ultrasound [**2125-11-27**]:
The liver is echogenic and shows some irregularity of outline
more suggestive of cirrhosis than fatty liver, though either
could be the cause. Portal blood flow is towards the liver. No
focal defects are seen within the liver. The gallbladder is free
of stones. The liver itself is enlarged.   Both right and left
kidneys are normal. Spleen could not be identified suggesting
that it is not enlarged. Pancreas and aorta are hidden by
overlying bowel gas. There is no ascites.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal liver more consistent with cirrhosis than
fatty infiltrate. No ascites.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 103584**] is a 60 y/o male with a history of hypertension,
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, probable alcoholic
cirrhosis, and alcohol abuse/dependence admitted with pneumonia
and hypoxemic respiratory failure. Hospital course was notable
for alcohol withdrawal, encephalopathy, and acute diastolic
heart failure.

#Hypoxemic respiratory failure/Pneumonia/Severe exacerbation of
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease:
Chest X-ray was consistent with left lower lobe pneumonia and
patient was requiried ICU admission and intubation. He was also
given steroids for exacerbation of COPD and was able to be
extubated. He completed his antibiotic course of Ceftriaxone and
azithromycin during his hospitalization and was discharged off
supplemental oxygen. He was also started on maintenance
Tiotropium and inhaled fluticasone on discharge.

#Acute diastolic heart failure:
Patient was felt to be volume overloaded on admission and was
diuresed with improvement in pulmonary edema and oxygen
requirement. Since he has had poor PCP follow up in the past and
was felt to have heart failure exacerbation due to infection,
which was treated prior to discharge, he was not discharged on
diuretics. Echocardiogram showed mild symmetric LVH, preserved
LVEF, and mild RV dilation.

#Alcohol withdrawal/encephalopathy/Cirrhosis:
Patient became delirious and agitated following extubation and
this was felt to be due to alcohol withdrawal and benzodiazepine
withdrawal. He was treated with Haldol and taperin
