History of Present Illness:
This 83 year old man pre-op aortic valve replacement for
stenosis and coronary bypass for double vessel disease was

cath which revealed multiple vessel disease.

Carotid Bruit        Right/Left: transmitted cardiac murmur

Pertinent Results:
[**2146-11-4**] ECG: Sinus rhythm. Left ventricular hypertrophy.
Lateral T wave changes probably due to left ventricular
hypertrophy. No previous tracing available for comparison.
.
[**2146-11-5**] CT Chest Without Contrast: 1. Calcified aortic valve.
Mildly calcified aortic arch. 2. Densely calcified coronary
arteries. 3. Cholelithiasis. 4. Mildly calcified takeoffs of the
left common carotid and left subclavian arteries.
.
[**2146-11-7**] Carotid U/S: Right ICA stenosis <40%. Left ICA stenosis
<40%.
.
[**2146-11-9**] Echo: PRE-BYPASS: The left atrium is dilated. No
spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the
left atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of the right
atrium/right atrial appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen
by 2D or color Doppler. There is moderate symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. There is mild regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction with focalities in the circumflex distribution.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed
(LVEF= 45 %). Doppler parameters are most consistent with Grade
I (mild) left ventricular diastolic dysfunction. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There
are simple atheroma in the aortic arch. The aortic valve
leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. There is critical
aortic valve stenosis (valve area <0.8cm2). Mild (1+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is a small pericardial effusion.
Post_Bypass: Patient is on epinephrine 0.02mcg/kg/min, Normal RV
systolic function. Overall LVEF 45%. The bioprosthetic valve in
the native aortic position is stable and functioning well with
residual mean gradient of 15mm of Hg. The thoracic aorta is
intact. Mild MR.

Brief Hospital Course:
As mentioned in the HPI, Mr. [**Known lastname **] was transferred from outside
following a syncopal episode at home. Cardiology service
medically managed patient upon admission and he was
appropriately worked-up for cardiac surgery. This included
carotid U/S, chest CT, Echo, GI consult, Dental consult along
with usual pre-op lab work. This was achieved over several days
and on [**11-9**] he was brought to the operating room where he
underwent an aortic valve replacement and coronary artery bypass
graft x 3. Please see operative report for surgical details.
Following surgery he was transferred to the CVICU for invasive
monitoring in stable condition.

On post-operative day one he was weaned from sedation, awoke
neurologically intact and extubated. On post-op day two his
chest tubes were removed and he was transferred to the telemetry
floor for further care. On post-op day three his epicardial
pacing wires were removed.
Diuresis towards his preoperative weight and pysical therapy
worked with him for mobility.  He continued to make progress
while working with physical therapy for strength and mobility.
On post-op day five he was discharged to home with VNA services
with the appropriate medications and follow-up appointments.

Discharge restrictions, activity and medications were discussed
prior to leaving the hospital.
