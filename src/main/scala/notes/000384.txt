Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 905**]
Chief Complaint:
Asthma Exaccerbation

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None Performed

History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 44F with history of bipolar disorder and
lifelong asthma who now presents with a new asthma
exaccerbation. The patient reports feeling ill over the weekend,
with signs of an upper respiratory infection, including
rhinitis, puffy eyes, and dry cough. She noticed that she was
feeling increasingly dyspnic over this time, particularly when
walking or during coughing/sneezing. She is not having
difficulty breathing at rest. She has been having increased
coughing with concurrent chest wall pain, the cough is not
productive of any sputum. She does report fever, with home Tmax
at 101.0 on Sunday, [**9-11**], she believes. She denies chills,
night sweats, myalgias. She further denies chest pain (except
during forceful coughing), palpitations, leg swelling, PND,
nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or constipation. She does not report
sick contacts or recent travel. These symptoms have been
bothersome to the point that the patient was unable to pursue
her regular activities, and she has been unable to sleep at
night secondary to coughing. On the day prior to admission, the
patient consulted with her pulmonologist's office (Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]) and was advised to increase her daily fluticasone; the
office also phoned in a prescription for azithromycin x5days. He
advised her to come to the ED, but the patient defered, out of
fear of bad experiences in the hospital. On the morning of
admission, the patient continued to be symptomatic with
shortness of breath, wheezing, and increased dry cough, and she
presented to the ED via a friend's car.
.
The patient does have an extensive history of asthma dating to
birth. She reports that "everything" triggers her asthma,
including seasonal change, activity, dust, pollen, mold, and
more. She has been hospitalized 4-5x for asthma, mostly between
[**2136**]-[**2137**]; she has required steroids in the past but has never
been intubated. Of note, the patient does report experiencing an
episode of steroid-induced psychosis when given high dose IV
steroids in [**2140**], prior to the diagnosis and management of her
underlying bipolar disorder. She is currently followed by
pulmonologist [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] and her home medication regimen
includes cromolyn, fluticasone, salmeterol, montelukast, and
cetirizine.
.
In the ED, the patient received Combivent nebulizers x3 along
with a single 500mg dose of azithromycin. She was afebrile and
O2sat was 94% on room air on arrival. She did not require oxygen
at the time. When the medicine team first met the patient in the
ED, she reported feeling generally comfortable, but still
dyspnic and "wheezy" on exertion/coughing.


Past Medical History:
1. Asthma (as above, last PFTs in [**8-1**] with nl FVC (4.38) and

2. Atopic dermatitis

4. Knee surgery?

or other drugs.

There is no family history of asthma, atopy, or other pulmonary
disease.

Brief Hospital Course:
1. Asthma-The patient was initially started on aggressive
albuterol and ipratropium nebulizer therapies alone, and a
decision was made to withold oral steroids given clinical
stability and history of steroid-induced psychosis.  However,
throughout the next day, the patient did not show signs of
improvement, with very wheezy, rhochorous lungs and some slight
decrease in O2sat to the low 90s, though she continued to look
well clinically and was able to speak full sentances without
shortness of breath.  By the morning of hospital day three, the
patient continued to still sound very wheezy and was requiring
1-2L oxygen to maintain oxygen saturation above the very low
90s, and a decision was made in conjunction with the patient's
outpatient pulmonologist, [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], to begin oral
prednisone at 40mg daily. Pt showed minimal improvement after
start of steroids.  Her dose was increased to 60mg the following
day.  Her hypoxia worsened overnight and she was changed to to
IV solumedrol.  A CXR from that time showed a new LLL infiltrate
that was read as atelectasis vs pneumonia vs pulmonary infarct.
The patient was started on levofloxacin.  She required admission
to the ICU for closer monitoring due to progressive hypoxia
despite steroids and nebulizers. She had a CTA that demonstrated
ground glass opacities and tree and [**Male First Name (un) 239**] morphology suggestive of
viral or an atypical bacterial pneumonia.  She was continued on
levofloxacin.  She was treated with around the clock nebulizers
and IV steroids and her peak flows imrpoved from 100s to 300.
Additionally, she was given pneumovax and influenza vaccines.
Given her history of mania on steroids, her steroids were
changed to prednisone in preparation for a taper. She was
transferred to the floor where she was weaned off of oxygen and
did well with ambulation.  She was discharged with a plan for
steroid taper and close follow-up by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]

2. Respiratory Infection-The patient presented with some
evidence of underlying respiratory infection, including a
pre-admission prodrome of URI symtoms such as rhinitis, puffy
eyes, and cough that preceded the development of wheezing and
dyspnea.  There was a history of fever to 101 at home as well,
though the patient was afebrile on admission.  She has had a
mildly elevated white count in the 12-13 range; no clinical
evidence of pneumonia on chest radiograph.  The patient had been
started on azithromycin x5 days as an outpatient and, given this
constellation of findings, a decision was made to continue the
full course of treatment as bacterial etiologies of infection
were included in the differential.  With wrosening hypoxia a CXR
was done that showed a possible new infiltrate.  A CT chest
revealed bilateral opactities and tree/[**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 239**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 106320**] suggestive
of viral or atypical bacterial pneumonia.  A 14 day course of
levofloxacin was prescrbed and patient clinically improved to
complete regimen as an outpatient

3. Bipolar disorder-The patient presented with a history of
steroid-induced psychosis which followed the administration of
high dose intravenous methylprednisolone during an admission for
asthma/mold exposure in [**2140**].  Therefore, the decision to start
even low dose oral predisone was made carefully in this patient
and in consultation with her outpatient psychopharmacoloist.
The patient did report some increased activiation/de
