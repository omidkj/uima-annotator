Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4365**]
Chief Complaint:
Right sided weakness

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
TPA administered

History of Present Illness:
HPI: Patient is a 83 year old RHM with hx of Afib on Coumadin,
DM, CAD, hypercholesterolemia, and mild dementia who was found
aphasic with vomitus at 9:40pm.  His last known well time was
9:30 and when the EMS arrived around 9:50, he was found to be
not
talking and completely hemiplegic on right side.  He was taken
to
[**Hospital3 **] where he was evaluated per telemed with
neurologist at [**Hospital1 2025**] who recommended IV tPA given that his INR was
1.3 and his significant deficits.  IV tPA started at 12:10 am
(2hrs 40 mins after last known well time) and finished at 1:20
at
which point, he was transferred here for further evaluation and
care.

Patient arrived at 1:45 and upon evaluation, he was showing some
improvement with moving his right leg which was completely
plegic
per report.

NIHSS after IV tPA here in ED:
2 for LOC questions
1 for minor facial paralysis
4 for no movement of RUE
1 for drift of RLE
1 mild/mod sensory loss
3 for mute, global aphasia
2 for severe dysarthria
Total 14

Patient was taken for CTA/CTP which showed no hemorrhagic
transformation plus patent proximal vessels but did have
increased MTT and decreased CBV on reformatted images.  However,
patient continued to make significant improvements including
almost full strength in RUE plus improvement of facial palsy as
well.

Per wife, patient was in his USOH until this evening.  No
infectious symptoms and no report of chest pain.  He was taking
all his meds including Coumadin.  However, he did have a bout of
pneumonia 2 weeks ago hence was on levaquin for 10 days which
finished 5 days prior to admission.

Patient walks with a cane at baseline and has mild dementia but
still highly independent - he still drives, pays own bills and
takes own meds.

CT/CTA: 1. No acute intracranial hemorrhage.

2. The CT perfusion study demonstrates ischemia in the
distribution of the
inferior division of the left middle cerebral artery. It is not
clear whether the blood volume in the posterior temporal portion
of this territory is slightly reduced, i.e. whether an area of
infarction is also present. Questionable focal loss of
[**Doctor Last Name 352**]/white matter differentiation in the posterior left temporal
lobe on the non-contrast CT scan is also inconclusive with
respect to the presence of an acute infarction.
3. Extensive cervical and intracranial atherosclerosis.
Moderate, 50%
stenosis in the proximal left internal carotid artery. Mild
stenoses at the origins of both vertebral arteries.
4. Abrupt cut-off in a small distal branch of the inferior
division of the
left middle cerebral artery, likely related to embolic
occlusion.
5. Emphysema. Atelectasis. Not clear if pleural effusions are
present.
6. Cervical spondylosis.

MRI: 1. Several small diffusion abnormalities in the left
temporal and left basal ganglia consistent with acute infarct in
the posterior division of the left MCA.
2. No evidence of acute large hemorrhage, mass, or small
microvascular
hemorrhages.
3. Small vessel ischemic disease.

CT head negative for acute process done 1 week after stroke

CXR [**3-22**]: Large left pleural effusion and small right pleural
effusion are unchanged. Left lower lobe atelectasis is stable.
The upper lobes are clear. Cardiomegaly is partially obscured by
the pleuroparenchymal abnormalities. Patient is status post
CABG. There is no pneumothorax. No new lung abnormalities are
present.



Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: Patient is an 83 yo man with pmhx of DM, HTN, CAD, CHF with
EF 20%, Afib, HCC here with acute MCA stroke managed with [**Hospital **]
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.

# MCA stroke: Patient is s/p TPA. Head CT without acute changes
[**3-20**]. Resolving defecits on exam and dysarrthria improved as
well on discharge. The stroke occured in the setting of a
subtherapeutic INR. Coumadin was restarted shortly after TPA
administration. Patient's INR climbed despite holding coumadin
to 8.6. 2.5 mg vitamin K which resulted in a trending down of
the INR to 2.3. The elevated INR was thought to be due to lack
of nutrition, antibiotics and liver disease (he has HCC). Given
the difficulty with his INR, lovenox was started when his INR
was 2.3. He should continue lovenox for his atrial fibrillation
and asa 81 mg daily. He has neurology follow-up. He needs  to
work with PT. Speech and swallow initially thought he was an
aspiration risk because of his poor mental status, but as his
mental status improved, he was able to eat purreed food with
thickened liquids and per nurse was not aspirating at all. This
may be able to be advanced as he continues to improve and regain
strength so he w
