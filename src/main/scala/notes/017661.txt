History of Present Illness:
83yo M with h/o HTN, DLP, CHF, A fib s/p permanent pacemaker
(4/'[**04**]), anterior MI s/p CABG ([**2084**]), AAA with multiple repairs,
CVA presents with shortness of breath.
.
Patient's cardiac history dates back to [**2084**] when he developed
chest pain and was found to have an anterior MI. He received a
CABG in [**2084**] and has been chest pain free since then.
.
Patient first experienced shortness of breath on exertion about
five years ago, when he was placed on Lasix with adequate
management of his symptoms until recently. Patient's EF as
reported by echo in [**2102**] and in [**2104-7-6**] was stable at 30-35%.

.
Patient's most recent symptoms became apparent beginning in
[**2104-5-6**] when he began to experience progressive episodes of
shortness of breath and fatigue. Symptoms began following a
stroke which occurred in [**2104-4-5**], which resulted in left arm
hemiparesis that resolved with physical therapy. Workup for the
stroke revealed that the patient was in atrial fibrillation, and
patient was placed on Coumadin. He began experiencing worsening
dyspnea on exertion and
had multiple medication adjustments of his HF regimen with
suboptimal response. As a result, an ICD was placed [**2104-6-5**] for
what was believed to be symptomatic a fib. Patient was also
subsequently cardioverted in [**2104-6-5**] for continued dyspnea on
exertion.
.
Patient reported worsening of dyspnea following placement of
ICD, with PND, orthopnea which was minimally relieved when
sitting up in a chair at night, inability to sleep due to
shortness of breath. Patient's activity tolerance also
decompensated from being able to walk and play golf without
shortness of breath in [**2104-5-6**] to his current state, where he
becomes dyspneic at rest. Patient also reports that he began to
experience hemoptysis of dark red sputum in the past two weeks.
He has noticed a bloated abdomen with nausea and feelings of
fullness for the past 4 months as well. Patient denies chest
pain, but reports that he experienced a mild tightness in his
chest with the episodes of dyspnea.
.
Patient was recently found by his cardiologist to have a low BP
in the upper 70's and upper 80's, and his Lisinopril was
discontinued and Lasix was stopped. Lasix was reinitiated and
stopped several times in an attempt to prevent hypotension while
treating symptoms of dyspnea.
.
Patient presented and was admitted to Upper [**Hospital 2748**] [**Hospital **]
Hospital [**9-21**] for continued worsening symptoms, and was believed
to be "profoundly azotemic." He was given IV fluids without any
improvement of dyspnea, and was re-initiated on Lasix briefly.
During his hospital stay at the OSH 2 days prior to presentation
at [**Hospital1 18**], per family, patient developed hypothermia of 90
degrees F. Family reports that patient was wrapped in multiple
blankets at the hospital, and his temperature increased to 92
degrees F.
.
CXR was obtained at OSH on [**9-23**] which showed cardiomegaly with
fine bibasilar markings. An echo obtained [**9-23**] at OSH showed
worsened MR (3+) with worsened EF ~15%. CT chest with IV
contrast was obtained at the OSH as well, which resulted in
elevation of patient's Cr from baseline of 0.9-1.5 to 3.4.
.
The plan at the OSH was to transfer the patient to [**Hospital **]
[**Hospital3 26522**] Center, but patient's family decided to seek
care at [**Hospital1 18**] and drove patient to [**Location (un) 86**]. On presentation, he
was mildly dyspneic on 3L O2 NC with sats in the low 90's.
However, patient reported that he felt his breathing was
improved. He has remained asymptomatic of chest pain since
admission, and had one episode of dyspnea and drops of sats into
80's following bedside TTE, which resolved following elevation
of the head of the bed and increase of oxygen to 4L. He is
currently breathing comfortably on 4L NC without use of
accessory muscles.
