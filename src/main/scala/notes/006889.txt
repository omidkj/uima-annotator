Intra-op TEE [**2141-10-17**]
Prebypass

No mass/thrombus is seen in the left atrium or left atrial
appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color
Doppler. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction
with hypokinesia of the apical and mid portions of the inferior
wall. Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly
depressed (LVEF= 45 %). Right ventricular chamber size and free
wall motion are normal. There are simple atheroma in the
descending thoracic aorta. There is no aortic valve stenosis.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. Moderate (2+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is a very small pericardial
effusion. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in person of the results on
[**2141-10-17**] at 1030am.

Post bypass

Patient is A paced and receiving an infusion of phenylephrine.
Biventricular systolic function is unchanged. Mild mitral
regurgitation persists. Aorta is intact post decannulation. Dr
[**Last Name (STitle) **] aware of post bypass findings.


Brief Hospital Course:
The patient received Plavix and was allowed to washout
preoperatively.  Carotids showed <70% stenoses bilaterally.
Vascular surgery was consulted and recommended followup in six
months.  The patient is followed by a vascular surgeon in
[**Hospital1 1474**].  She does have a history of poorly controlled
diabetes, and [**Last Name (un) **] was consulted, we appreciate the
recommendations.  Nitroglycerine drip was initiated and titrated
to pain free.  The routine preop workup was completed, including
PFTs and the patient went to the operating room on [**2141-10-17**] for
CABG with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  See operative report for details.
Overall the patient tolerated the procedure well and
post-operatively was transferred to the CVICU in stable
condition for recovery and invasive monitoring.  Vancomycin was
used for surgical antibiotic prophylaxis given the patient's
preoperative length of stay greater than 24 hours.
POD 1 found the patient extubated, alert and oriented and
breathing comfortably.  The patient was neurologically intact
and hemodynamically stable, weaned from inotropic and
vasopressor support.  She became hypertensive and hyperglycemia
remained an issue.  She remained in the unit extra days for
management of these issues.  Beta blocker was initiated and the
patient was gently diuresed toward the preoperative weight.  The
patient was transferred to the telemetry floor for further
recovery.  Chest tubes and pacing wires were discontinued
without complication.  The patient was evaluated by the physical
therapy service for assistance with strength and mobility.  By
the time of discharge on POD 8 the patient was ambulating
freely, the wound was healing and pain was controlled with oral
analgesics.  She was deconditioned and it was determined that
she would benefit from a short rehab stay.  The patient was
discharged to the LiveCare Center in [**Location 15289**] in good
condition with appropriate follow up instructions.
