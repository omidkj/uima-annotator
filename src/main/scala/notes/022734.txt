IMAGING
-------
Chest X-ray on admission:
Increased opacity at the left lung base, which may be due to
increase in existing atelectasis at the site rather than
pneumonia.  However, particularly if clinical concern for
pneumonia persists, standard PA and lateral radiographs may be
helpful to evaluate further and directly compare to earlier
studies when clinically feasible.

MICROBIOLOGY
------------
Blood culture x 2: pending


Brief Hospital Course:
[**Hospital 112004**] COURSE

43 year old female with hepatitis C, HIV, polysubstance abuse,
recent diagnosis of anaplastic T-cell lymphoma s/p 2 month
hospitalzation on BMT (on cycle 2 of [**Hospital1 **]) course complicated
by VRE and coag neg staph bacteremia admitted to ICU for opiate
toxicity requiring naloxone gtt.

ACUTE ISSUES:
-------------
#Altered mental status: The most likely etiology was thought to
be opiate toxicity given positive tox screen and immediate
response to naloxone. Most likely source of opiate intoxication
is dilaudid that she was prescribed on discharge. Patient's
mental status improved after naloxone gtt was discontinued.

#Anion gap metabolic acidosis: Pt. was found to have an elevated
AG at 15 with a normal lactate and ketones in the urine. The gap
closed to 13 on the day following admission and the patient was
taking good PO.

CHRONIC ISSUES:
---------------
#Anaplastic T-cell lymphoma on [**Hospital1 **] cycle 2. Bone marrow
transplant was notified that she was in the ICU. This issue
remained stable during her course and the patient will follow up
with her outpatient provider.

#HIV ((CD4 372 [**2138-6-21**]) with history of toxoplasmosis, on
darunavir 400 mg Tablet 2 tab po daily, emtricitabine-tenofovir
200-300 mg 1 tab po daily and ritonavir 100 mg Tablet 1 tab po
daily. The patient was continued on her home medications during
the hospitalization.

#GERD: The patient was continued on her home famotidine.

#Bipolar Disorder: The patient was continued on home
lamotrigine, ativan and risperdal prn.

#Asthma: The patient was continued on her home asthma
medications.


Medications on Admission:
-darunavir 400 mg Tablet 2 tab po daily
-emtricitabine-tenof
