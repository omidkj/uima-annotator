HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This 48-year-old female has a
history of rheumatic fever and mitral valve disease.  She is
status post mitral commissurotomy in the 80s and then had a
minimally invasive mitral valve repair in [**2180**] with a ring.
She has had dizziness, shortness of breath, fatigue and
palpitations over the past two to three years which has been
increasing over the past few months.  She underwent cardiac
catheterization on [**2187-3-28**], which revealed an ejection
fraction of 47%, global hypokinesis, 3+ mitral regurgitation
and normal coronary arteries.  She is now admitted for
anticoagulation prior to mitral valve replacement.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for history of atrial
fibrillation.  She is status post ablations in [**2184**], [**2185**] and
[**4-11**].  History of mitral valve disease, status post closed
mitral commissurotomy in the 80s and mitral valve repair in
[**2180**].  History of pulmonary hypertension.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1.  Lopressor 50 mg po b.i.d.
2.  Micro-K 30 mEq po b.i.d.
3.  Lasix 20 mg po q.d.

ALLERGIES:  She is allergic to amiodarone.  She had increased
LFTs with amiodarone.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Unremarkable.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  She does not smoke cigarettes.  She does not
drink alcohol.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Unremarkable.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  She is a well-developed female in no
apparent distress.  Vital signs stable.  Afebrile.  Head,
eyes, ears, nose and throat exam:  Normocephalic, atraumatic.
Extraocular movements intact.  Oropharynx benign.  Neck was
supple, full range of motion.  No lymphadenopathy or
thyromegaly.  Carotids 2+ and equal bilaterally without
bruits.  Lungs were clear to auscultation and percussion.
Cardiovascular exam:  Irregular rate and rhythm with a 2/6
systolic ejection murmur and a positive S3.  Abdomen was
soft, nontender with positive bowel sounds, no masses or
hepatosplenomegaly.  Extremities were without cyanosis,
clubbing or edema.  Pulses were 2+ and equal bilaterally
throughout.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  She was admitted and she had been off her
Coumadin so she was started on heparin and on [**4-30**], she
underwent mitral valve replacement with a #25 mm [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1495**] [**Male First Name (un) 923**]
mechanical valve and a tricuspid valve repair with a 30 mm
[**Doctor First Name 7624**] Annuloplasty [**Doctor First Name **].  The cross >.......<time was 70
minutes, so the bypass time was 170 minutes.  She tolerated
the procedure well and was transferred to the CSRU on
milrinone, neo and propofol.  She had a stable postoperative
night.  She remained intubated on her postoperative night and
was extubated on postoperative day number one.  She was
weaned off her milrinone and was just on neo.  She had her
chest tubes discontinued on postoperative day number two.
She did have thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 42 and
was seen by Hematology who felt she did not have
>........<heparin.  Her platelets did come back up and she
lost all her drips and was transferred to the floor on
postoperative day number three.  She continued to have a
stable postoperative course except for she did have a rapid
atrial fibrillation up to the 150s.  Electrophysiology was
following her and she was eventually increased to Lopressor
75 mg q.i.d. and this kept her rate in the 60s with
occasional increases up to the 100s.  She also remained in
the hospital for anticoagulation and on postoperative day
number 11, she was discharged to home in stable condition.
Electrophysiology felt that she needed follow-up in four to
six weeks with them as they could not use the amiodarone due
to her increased LFTs when she was on amiodarone in the past,
and the fact that it was not effective.  They also felt
ablation was appropriate again and they would like to
re-evaluate her in four to six weeks.

LABORATORIES ON DISCHARGE:  White blood cell count 13.7,
hematocrit 29.5, platelet count 529,000.  Sodium 139,
potassium 4, chloride 101, CO2 23, BUN 13, creatinine 0.7,
blood sugar 100.  PT 21.5 with an INR of 3.1.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
1.  Lasix 20 mg po b.i.d. times seven days, then 20 mg po
q.d.
2.  Colace 100 mg po b.i.d.
3.  Percocet [**1-11**] po q. 4-6 hours prn pain.
4.  Lopressor 75 mg po q. 6 hours.
5.  Potassium 30 mEq po b.i.d.
6.  Coumadin 6 mg po q.h.s.

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:  She will have her INR checked q.
Monday, Wednesday, Friday, next week and followed by Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 3444**] and she will see Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3444**] in one to two weeks and have
