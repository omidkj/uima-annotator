HISTORY OF PRESENTING ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname 30097**] is a 79 year-old
Russian male with history of renal cell carcinoma diagnosed
in [**2166**], status post left nephrectomy in 2,000, status post
IL2 therapy, with lung metastasis, hypertension, atrial
fibrillation, and diabetes who presented one year ago with an
metastatic renal cell carcinoma in [**Month (only) 547**] of this year.  An
MRI on [**2169-5-1**] showed a dural based mass involving the
calvarium and superior sagittal sinus.  He was admitted on
[**5-23**] for tumor embolization and left frontal parietal
craniectomy with resection of the tumor and cranioplasty on
the 13th.  The patient's surgery was uneventful.  On the
evening of [**5-24**], however, the patient developed right arm
Enzymes were cycled at that time and the patient ruled in for
non-Q wave myocardial infarction with troponin peaking at
greater than 50 and CK of 1,014 with an MB of 82.
Electrocardiogram showed a new left bundle branch with ST
elevation and T wave inversions in V3 and V4.  The patient
was started on intravenous Lopressor and  nitroglycerin.  The
patient was then taken for cardiac catheterization which
revealed three vessel disease with left main disease and an
intra-aortic balloon pump was placed prophylactically.  At
this time the patient came under care at the Cardiac Care
Unit team.  At the time of our evaluation the patient had no
complaints.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1) Metastatic renal cell carcinoma
left, diagnosed in [**2167-11-11**] with lung metastasis at
diagnosis.  Patient underwent IL2 therapy beginning in
[**Month (only) 956**] of 2,000 complicated by atrial fibrillation.
Patient underwent left nephrectomy in [**2168-5-12**].  Brain
metastasis a per History of Present Illness.  2) Non-insulin
dependent diabetes mellitus.  3) Hypertension.  4) Anemia.
5) Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation secondary to IL2 treatment.
6) Status post appendectomy.

MEDICATIONS (Outpatient):  1) Digoxin 0.25 mg q. day, 2)
Atenolol 25 mg p.o. q. day, 3) Coumadin.  4) Colace.  5)
Multivitamin.  6) Boost.

TRANSFER MEDICATIONS:  1) Insulin sliding scale.  2)
Lopressor 25 mg b.i.d.  3) Nitroglycerin drip.  4) aspirin
325 mg q. day.  5) Captopril 25 mg t.i.d.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient moved to the U.S. in [**2126**] from
[**Country 12930**].  He has worked as an engineer until retirement last
month.  He has a tobacco history but said he quit in the
[**2117**].

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On transfer temperature of 99, blood
pressure of 150/90, pulse was 75, O2 saturation was 95% on
three liters.  In general the patient was an elderly male who
was lying flat in bed and appeared comfortable.  He was in no
acute distress.  Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat
examination revealed a bandaged scalp with an incision that
went across the top of his head.  Pupils are equal, round and
reactive to light.  There were no oral lesions.  Mucous
membranes were moist.  Neck was supple without bruits.  Heart
was regular rate and rhythm with a grade II/VI holosystolic
murmur at the apex radiating to the axilla.  Lungs were clear
to auscultation anteriorly.  Abdomen was soft and nontender.
Extremities were without edema.  A balloon pump was placed in
the right femoral vein.  Patient had warm feet.  On brief
neurologic testing the patient showed no focal signs.
Cranial nerves appeared to be intact and patient was alert
and oriented with fluent language.

LABORATORY STUDIES:  White count was 8.2 with hematocrit of
28 and platelets of 194.  Chem-7 was remarkable only for BUN
of 36, creatinine of 1.7 which was the patient's baseline.
Serum glucose was 285.  CKs peaked at 1,014 with an MB of 82
and MB index of 8.  Troponin was greater than 50.  Chest
x-ray showed mild congestive heart failure and no focal
infiltrates.  Electrocardiogram on [**5-17**] showed sinus
bradycardia with left ventricular hypertrophy and left axis
deviation.  There was poor R wave progression and left
anterior vesicular block.  Electrocardiogram on [**5-24**]
showed bigeminy with flattened T waves anteriorly and later
in the evening with development of chest pain and new left
bundle branch block.  Electrocardiogram on [**5-25**]
elevations in V3 and V4 with T wave inversion.
Echocardiogram from [**2168-4-11**] showed left atrial enlargement
with slight left ventricular hypertrophy.  Ejection fraction
was measured at 45 percent.  Echocardiogram postoperatively
on this admission showed left atrial enlargement as well as
right atrial enlargement.  There was left ventricular
hypertrophy.  Ejection fraction was estimated at 20 to 25
percent.  Patient had pulmonary hypertension, moderate aortic
stenosis, 1 to 2+ mitral regurgitation and wall motion
abnormality.  Cardiac catheterization on [**5-25**] showed left
main disease with an ostial 38 or 40 percent, distal 90
percent, mid LAD lesion of 80 percent, diagonal of 100
percent, mid left circumflex of 90 percent with right to left
collateral flow distally, RCA with 90 percent involving the
PDA.

HOSPITAL COURSE AFTER TO CARDIAC CARE UNIT BY SYSTEMS:
1) Cardiovascular.  Given the patient's three vessel with
left main disease the patient was evaluated by CT surgery.
With the severity of his disease, decreased ejection
fraction, and other co-morbid illnesses the patient was
thought to be too high risk exceeding the possible benefit of
bypass grafting.  The patient was initially maintained on
intravenous nitroglycerin and intravenous heparin was
discontinued after removal of intra-aortic balloon pump and
intravenous nitroglycerin was weaned.  The patient was
maintained on daily dose of aspirin and Lopressor was
increased gradually to 100 mg t.i.d. and later switched to
150 mg b.i.d.  Accupril was increased slowly to 100 mg t.i.d.
 Given the patient's elevated left ventricular and diastolic
pressure of 26 the patient was diuresed and later started on
a daily dose of Lasix orally.  As for the patient's atrial
fibrillation with the patient's increasing risk of falling
anticoagulation was discussed wit the neurosurgery team who
felt that it would be wise to hold off on restarting Coumadin
postoperatively and to re-evaluate this in one month after
the patient is back on his feet.

2) Hematology.  The patient's hematocrit stayed persistently
between 28 and 30 while the intra-aortic balloon pump was in.
Hemolysis laboratories were sent ruling this out as the
etiology.  Patient was transfused several units of blood with
inappropriate bumps after intra-aortic balloon pump was
removed hematocrit climbed to the 33 and was stable for
several days.  During the time the balloon pump was in the
platelets also fell from approximately 200 to low 100s.
Heparin was discontinued and Zantac was changed to Prilosec.
Platelet count began to rise after the balloon pump was
removed.

3) Neurology.  On postoperative day #6 the patient' activity
the was changed from out of bed to chair.  At this point it
was noted that he was not able to bear weight on his right
lower extremity.  On muscle strength testing the patient
showed an upper motor neuron distribution of weakness with
proximal muscle strength muscle groups being 4 to 4+/5 on
motor testing.  A head CT obtained showed postoperative
changes with edema and effacement of the sulci over the left
parietal region.  There was no hemorrhage or infarction in
any major territory noted.  MRI obtained showed mild compression
of the lateral
[**Doctor Last Name 534**] on the left . After
discussion with neurosurgery these changes were considered
normal for his postoperative course and the patient's
strength was expected to improve.  On subsequent days motor
strength was improved.  On the date of discharge right and
left biceps were noted to 4+/5, triceps were 5-/5, right
iliopsoas was -[**4-15**], quads and hamstrings were [**4-15**], tibialis
anterior was [**4-15**] and plantar flexors were [**4-15**].  The remainder
of the neurologic examination was unremarkable.  The patient
will have follow up radiation therapy in one week with
radiation of the sagittal sinus portion of the tumor that w
