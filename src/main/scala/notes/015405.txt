Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1505**]
Chief Complaint:
Fevers, bacteremia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2107-9-2**] Mitral Valve Replacement ([**Company **] mosiac porcine
valve)

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 57yo gentleman with h/o Hodgkin's lymphoma s/p
radiotherapy in [**2079**] with chronic lymphedema, recently
discharged from OSH with LE group B strep cellulitis on course
of vancomycin finished [**7-14**]. On [**7-24**], he noted onset of
fevers, chills, and body aches, and he presented to the hospital
on [**7-26**]. Vitals on presentation: T 103 106 135/78 100% RA. Exam
was notable for murmur and no evidence of cellulitis. Initial
TTE showed "severe AS/AI and thickened valves" with normal EF,
but repeat only showed mild AI and mild MR. [**Name13 (STitle) 93448**] showed
evidence of vegitations. He was initially started on Vanc and
Cipro.

OSH Course:
On the day of admission to OSH, pt was transferred to the ICU
for hypotension to 70/50, which initially responded to IV
fluids. Linezolid was added to his antibiotic regimen out of
concern for VRE. ID consult done [**7-27**], and linezolid/cipro were
stopped. Started on Vanco at 1500mg q12h and gentamicin. On
[**7-27**], pt had episode of AFib with hypotension, Cardizem
attempted for rate control without success so IV esmolol was
started with addition of IV phenylephrine to maintain BP. Team
was concerned about possible PE in view of his persistent
tachycardia and started him on lopressor. Right IJ placed [**7-28**].
CXR [**7-28**] demonstrated RLL consolidation vs septic emboli.
.
[**Hospital1 18**] Course:
Patient arrived at CCU with initial VS: T100.0 82/58 129 12 100%
on AC 650 12 100% FiO2 PEEP 5. He had been paralyzed with
vecuronium during transport. His esmolol was weaned with rapid
improvement in his BP to 109/70. Bedside TEE was performed and
demonstrated 3+ mitral regurg with vegetations and perforation
of the mitral valve. He was placed on iv levophed with
stabilization of his blood pressures and his vent was weaned to
AC 650 16 FiO2 60% PEEP 10. He was bolused 500cc NS x 2 and a
Swan Ganz catheter was placed. ID was consulted; Vanc and Cipro
were initially given until medical records from [**Hospital 1514**] Hospital
were obtained, at which point antibiotics were switched to Vanc
and Gent.
.
On review of symptoms, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
He denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other
review of systems were negative.
.
Per notes in chart, cardiac review of systems is notable for
absence of chest pain, dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal
dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or
presyncope.

Past Medical History:
Hyperlipidemia, Hypertension, Hodgkin's Disease s/p Chemo and
XRT, Gastroesophageal Reflux disease with esophageal ulcer and

Pertinent Results:
[**7-28**] Echo:No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body of
the left atrium or the body of the right atrium. No atrial
septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There
are simple atheroma in the aortic arch. There are simple
atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened.
By planimetry, the aortic valve area measures 1.6cm2 consistent
with mild aortic stenosis. No masses or vegetations are seen on
the aortic valve. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflet are mildly thickened. There are vegations
on the mitral valve the largest being a moderate-sized
vegetation on the anterior leaflet of mitral valve measuring
approximately 1.5cm in size. Color doppler shows flow through
the anterior leaflet consistent with perforation. Moderate to
severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen. No reversal in the
pulmonary veins is seen..
From OSH: BCx (per ID note): 2/2 bottles positive for Group B
Strep sensitive to penicillin, vanc; resistant to erythromycin,
azithromycin, clindamycin..

CHEST (PA & LAT)
Reason: Please evaluate for pulmonary effusion, acute changes
[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
57M with mitral valve endocarditis recent hemoptysis likely [**12-31**]
to MR, with Hct of 23 from 28
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
Please evaluate for pulmonary effusion, acute changes
CLINICAL HISTORY: Mitral valve endocarditis, recent hemoptysis.
CHEST:
Comparison is made with the prior chest x-ray of [**9-3**].
The size of the left pleural effusion has decreased and the
lungs are now somewhat clearer suggesting an improvement in the
degree of failure. Chronic lung changes are again noted.
IMPRESSION: Improving failure.
