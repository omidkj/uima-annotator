History of Present Illness:
61 yo female with recent diagnosis of parkinsons, who was
admitted to OSH on [**12-3**]. Her initial presentation was
documanted as "semi-responsive state with significant tremor and
delirium". Patient has long history of depression and alcohol
abuse. She also was progressively declining with regard of her
cognitive function, and coordination over the past several
months. Months ago she was diagnosed with parkinsons an
perscribed Amantadine 100 mg [**Hospital1 **] and Sinemet 25/100 tid. Over
the past month she was found to significantly overdosing her
self on these medication (one month supply used within 2 wks).
He over all presentaion of confusion, tremorness, Hallucinations
and MS [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 27836**]. He neurologist was called by her
partner and [**Name (NI) **] eval was recommended.

In the OSH she was admitted and given empiric Abx (elevated WBC)
and Benzodiazepines for concern of EtOH withdrawal or infection.
She did not respond to Benzodiazepines but her presentation
rather worsened. She was seen by psych, thought to be in
delirium, and given Haldol as well as Zyprexa in high doses.
Again her clinical presentation deteriorated (fever, tremeor,
obtundation), and requiring intubation for airway protection.
Neurology consult expressed concern for NMS in the setting of
sudden decrease in antiparkinsons as well as antipsychotic use
with fevers to 104, elevated CK, ARF, and leucocytosis. Transfer
to [**Hospital 83821**] care center was recommended.

She was found to have gram negative UTI.
.
Other medications included a course of levofloxacin,
Clindamycin, librium, klonipin, ativan drip, valium, trazadone,
amanatadine 100 [**Hospital1 **], bupropion 100 mg [**Hospital1 **].

Brief Hospital Course:
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 61 yo with a history of alcoholism and
recently diagnosed parkinson's disease, who presented to OSH
with acute change in her mental status and was transferred b/c
of concern for NMS.
.
# Acute MS change: The main differential is neuroleptic
malignancy syndrome (NMS), alcohol withdrawal or acute delirium.
 Given that she did not improve with benzodiazepenes and acute
worsened with typical neuroleptics at the outside hospital, NMS
seemed most likely.  She was started on high dose Sinemet
(25/100 x2 tabs Q6hrs) and amantadine with slow improvement in
her rigidity.  She was also sedated and required intubation for
mental status changes.  Her Lumbar Puncture showed no signs of
infection and her antibiotics were stopped.  Neurology was
consulted, and as she improved, they suggested slow weaning of
the Sinemet dose.  Even as her rigidity improved, she was
significantly agitated and there was concern for alcohol
withdrawal.  Her agitation improved with benzos, and she
initially required a midazolam drip.  She was extubated [**2182-12-8**]
as her mental status had improved and was weaned down to home
plus few PRN doses of diazepam due to alcohol withdrawl per the
CIWA scale.  On [**2182-12-9**] she improved further and had her NG
tube pulled and tolerated a clear fluid diet.  She was
transferred to the floor for further monitoring and
consideration of placement.
.
#Parkinson's disease - Pt was restarted on double her home dose
of anti-Parkinsonian medications, given she had been on these
doses prior to admission.  She was started on a slow taper.  Her
outpt neurologist should continue to taper her Sinemet until she
reaches the lowest dose that will control her symptoms.
.
# Fever/leukocytosis: On admission she had low-grade fevers and
a leukocytosis to 23.6 with 83% bands, raising concern for
meningitis.  She was treated empirically with
vancomycin/meropenem/acyclovir for two days until she was
afebrile and had a clean LP.  She had a normal CXR, negative
blood cultures and negative urine cultures.  She grew coag
positive gram positive cocci on sputum cultures while intubated
but at that point was afebrile without respiratory symptoms.
Fever and white count were most secondary to NMS.
.
# Acute renal failure: The patient presented in mild renal
failure with a creatinine of 1.2, raising concerns for
rhabdomyolysis (CK 3714).  Her creatinine improved with
hydration down to 0.6 and her CK trended down slowly with
improvement of her NMS.  On presentation she was hypernatremic
with low potassium, calcium, magnesium and phosphate, likely
secondary to muscle breakdown and NMS.  Her electrylytes were
repleted and normalized.  The hypernatremia improved with
hydration.
.
# Elevated transaminases: The patient had elevated liver
function tests with AST>ALT suggestive of alcoholism.  A right
upper quadrant ultrasound was normal.
.
# Anemia: The patient presented with a normocytic anemia.  She
had one spurious lab value on [**12-8**] that was in-line with her
baseline on repeat.  Hemolysis labs were negative.  Her iron
stores were normal with elevated ferritin, suggesting anemia of
chronic disease.
.
# Coagulopathy: On admission the patient had a mild coagulopathy
with elevated PT and PTT.  This normalized without any
intervention.
.
# EtOH abuse: The patient has a history of significant
