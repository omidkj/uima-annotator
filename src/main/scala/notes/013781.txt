History of Present Illness:
This is a 85 who has history of hypertension and anemia who
presented to [**Hospital 8**] hospital with acute dyspnea. She arrived
in [**Hospital1 60375**] ED looking pale and diaphoretic using her
accessory muscles to breathe.

On arrival, she was found to be confused and agitated. Initial

with repeat blood gas of 7.33/42/371. She recieved IV nitro, IV
heparin, IV [**Last Name (LF) 60376**], [**First Name3 (LF) **], IV lopressor 5 x1, IV lasix 100mg

According to a family member, she has been intermittently short
of breath for a month and claims that it is relieved by
inhalers. At baseline, she is able to climb up a flight of

more shortness of breath. SHe might have been more tired in the
recent while. According to the daughter, she has no
orthopnea/PND. SHe has leg edema for several months and has been
worsening for a month. She denies orthostatic hypotension.

Brief Hospital Course:
85 year old with history of hypertension presented to the OSH
with acute pulmonary edema secondary to hypertension in the
setting of aortic stenosis. She is now post drug eluting stent
to rPL. She will continue on aspirin, lipitor, and plavix for 9
months with follow up in the cardiology clinic. Echocardiogram
was performed on [**2147-2-24**] which showed EF>65% and severe aortic
valve stenosis. She was started on low dose losartan given that
she has aortic stenosis and did not tolerate lisinopril. Beta
blockade was deferred as it will reduce inotropy and was thought
to be deleterious given the aortic stenosis. Hydrochlorothiazide
was started for continued diuresis for goal of euvolemia.
Patient and family was given the option of valvular replacement
decided to be DNR/DNI.
.
Cardiac: Patient had coronary artery disease and underwent
catheterization with intervention (DES in rPL).  There was no
evidence of MI on ECG and cycled cardiac enzymes were flat.
Medical management includes [**Date Range **], lipitor, losartin, and plavix
for 9 months. She presented with CHF and required brief
intubation for pulmonary edema. Echocardiogram [**2147-2-24**] revealed
EF>65% with severe aortic valve stenosis (area 0.8).  Beta
blockade is deferred given the severity of aortic stenosis
(would prefer to have the inotropy). Also, vasodilators and
preload reduction should be avoided. Valve replacement surgery
was refused. She will continue HCTZ for a goal of euvolemia. The
patient remained in normal sinus rhythm and was without adverse
events on telemetry monitoring.
.
Bacteremia: Patient developed ceftriaxone sensitive S.
pneumoniae bacteremia identified when one of four blood culture
bottles was positive. The remaining 3 bottles have no growth to
date. The likely source is the lung with CXR on [**2-24**] post
extubation suggestive of a right lower lobe opacity near an
effusion. Repeat CXR on day of discharge was negative for
pneumonia or CHF. She received 3 days of vancomycin and was
switched to ceftriaxone IV after sensitivities came back.  She
will continue a 2 week course of ceftriaxone via midline access
at rehab. Pneumovax was administered.
.
Chronic Anemia: The patient has a known iron deficiency anemia
for which she takes iron supplementation and has refused
colonoscopy. Hematocrit was stable at discharge. It decreased
post cath and required transfusion of PRBCs to return to goal of
over 30.
.
Prophylaxis: Continue subcutaneous heparin and protonix.
.
Pt was discharged to rehab in stable condition for physical
therapy and IV antibiotics. She was ambulating with assistance
and tolerating a cardiac healthy diet.
