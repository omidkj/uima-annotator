 CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2145-9-13**] 7:15 AM
[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
HISTORY: Esophageal rupture, bronchomalacia and right lung
atelectasis.

IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**9-4**] through 13:

Right lung previously entirely collapsed on [**9-11**] showed
some improvement in aeration on [**9-12**], but more atelectasis
and at least a small right pleural effusion today. Mild
interstitial edema in the left lung which worsened from [**9-11**] through 13 has stabilized. Small left pleural effusion has
decreased. Cardiac silhouette size is difficult to assess, but
may be enlarged relative to [**9-4**]. Stents are seen in the
descending thoracic aorta and right main bronchus. Feeding tube
passes through the mid stomach and out of view.

chest CXR for dobhoff placement [**2145-9-13**]
IMPRESSION: Successful nasointestinal tube placement with the
tip located within the third portion of the duodenum.


Brief Hospital Course:
On [**2145-8-19**] Patient was admitted to the thoracic surgery
service with sepsis, MS changes, was started on broad spectrum
anitbiotics. PICC line was dc'd and tip sent for culture. CT
chest showed decrease in size of collection around the posterior
distal esophagus and not a walled-off abscess, no evidence of
perforation. HD Ct negative for bleed. Blood Cultures from the
[**8-19**] and [**8-20**] grew out pan Resistance pseudomonas -only with
intermediate sensitivty to amikacin.
[**8-20**]: video swallow with some aspiration, so NPO. no evidence of
esophageal leak.
[**8-21**]: Patient was transferred to the ICu for closer monitoring
and pulmonary toilet. CVL was placed for TPN and antibiotics
bedside bronch for RLL collapse [**3-4**] to mucus plug - purulent
secretion were seen throughout right lung bronchi. ,
BAL/Urine/Blood showed pseudomonas. Got 2U rbcs.
[**8-23**]: PICC line placed for abx; Video: nectar thick liquids,
ground solids ok; Renal US: good perfusion, no obstruction.
transferred back to the floor.
[**8-25**]: ID consulted for management for MDR pseudommonas. Patient
was allowed po intake, but TPN continued for calories. `
[**8-27**]: Bronch=95% bronchomalacia, FB RUL, lots secretions; BAl
still grew pseudommonas. remained confused after the procedure.
2U rbcs.
[**8-29**]: HR to 30s, unresponsive, intubated, tx to CSRU. started on
pressors for low BP, cardiac enzymes negative. CVL placed again.
Bronch for secreation/diagnosis - still bronchomalacia with
RML/RLL collapse, BAl still grew pseudommonas
[**8-30**]: TPN dc'd and TF started via NGT. renal US normal. 1u rbc .
amio drip for Afib
[**8-31**]: CT - no sinusitis, stable chest effusion, no abdominal
abscess. Dilt for rate
[**9-1**]: rigid bronch, R MS [**Last Name (Titles) **]. Blood Cx neg. CVL changed over
wire
[**9-2**]: RUQ US for soem tenderness - negative; wound care consulted
for weeping UE. Blood cx neg. lasix gtt started. TF increased to
goal. heparin started for Afib anticoagulation.spiking fevers x
2 days.
[**9-5**]: RISB 81, on CPAP. amio to po.
[**9-6**]: bronch/BAL - pan R pseudomonas .lasix gtt continued for
diuresis
[**9-7**]: bronch for secretions, extubated, DNR/DNI. Transitioned
from haparin to coumadin for Afib.
[**9-8**]: IR for NJT placement. vanc/fluc dc'd
[**9-10**]: PICC placed again, CVL dc'd
[**9-11**]: R lung collapse, pulled out NJ-tube, bronch for secretions
w/ good results. diamox for diuresis
[**9-12**]: bronch for lots of secretions
[**9-13**]: replace NJT for 3rd time
[**9-14**]: 2U FFP for high INR (4.7), coumadin being held UNTIL INR
at goal 2.0.

Biggest problem upon discharge is respiratory - still has
copious amount of secretions requing frequent suctioning.
Otherwise, cardiovasculary stable, making good urine, on TF,
finishing course of antibiotics.
