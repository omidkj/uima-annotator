Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
intubation, CVVH

History of Present Illness:
HPI: 80 y/o F with PMH DM, spinal stenosis, PVD and neuropathy,
h/o resistant E. coli UTIs, stage IV decubitus ulcer now
presents from [**Hospital 599**] rehab facility for f/u abnormal labs drawn.
Pt and pt's husband are unsure of why pt is here, but per
nursing notes from rehab, pt has been increasingly agitated over
the last several weeks with decreased PO intake. Had labs drawn
today at rehab with creat increased to 1.5 (baseline 1.0-1.2)
and K increased at 5.7. Per lab report sent from [**6-13**], pt K was
elevated at 5.2 and creat increasing to 1.2. Pt reports no focal
signs/symptoms - denies any fevers/chills, no dysuria, no n/v,
no abd pain, no d/c, no sob, no CP. Does admit to overall
fatigue and weakness and decreased PO intake over the last
several days.
In ED, UA + for UTI. Pt's SBP initially 90/30, then subsequently
decreased to 80/50. Labs remarkable for creat increased to 1.5
from baseline and K 5.8. Given kayexylate in ED and given 4 L NS
with SBP improved to 110-120s, diastolics still low in 30s with
MAPs high 50s to 60 (looking at previous d/c summaries, pt has
always had wide pulse pressures with low diastolics). Given
Vancomycin 1 g IV x 1 and Aztreonam 500 mg IV x 1. MICU called
to evaluate pt but given that pt's SBP had improved
significantly after IVF resuscitation and pt had continued to
have good UOP (150cc/2hr), was felt that pt would be safe for
floor.

Brief Hospital Course:
While on floor, pt experienced hypercarbic respiratory failure
of unknown etiology, was intubated and transferred to the
[**Hospital Ward Name 332**]-ICU on [**2152-6-24**].

[**Hospital Ward Name 100958**] hospital course:

1.) Respiratory Failure:  Initially thought [**1-26**] to flash
pulmonary edema of ?etiology (no hx of CHF) and pt was treated
initially for ?CHF with diuresis with ethacrynic acid (distant
hx of sulfa allergy - therefore intially lasix was not used),
also treated for ?COPD with steroids.  Immediate complications
included excessive bloody secretions, thought likely [**1-26**]
traumatic intubation, which was managed with holding
anticoagulation and frequent suctioning.  During this time CXR
was showing improvement and differential diagnosis included 1.)
flash pulmonary edema [**1-26**] norpace for AFib (therefore norpace
d/ced) or MR (ECHO had demonstrated 1+ MR) - attempted treatment
of pulmonary edema included diuresis without improvement 2.)
Chemical pneumonitis 2/2 blood from traumatic intubation,
although did not clear with time 3.) Viral pneumonia 4.)
Pulmonary/Renal process - thought of as a possibility [**1-26**] bloody
secretions (although more likely contributed bloody secretions
to traumatic intubation) - r/o w/ negative ANCA, negative U/A
for blood.  Pulmonary embolism was ruled out on [**6-26**] with
negative CTA.  Respiratory status complicated by worseing lung
exam/CXR/oxygenation/fever spike on [**7-2**] with sputum cultures
sent that grew MRSA - therefore patient experience VAP +MRSA.
Was treated with 14 day course of Vancomycin.  Subsequent sputum
culture [**7-12**] was + for pseudomonas and patient was treated w/
Genatmicin x 2 days, switched to Merapenem after sensitivities
returned.  Further complication of patients respiratory status
was fluid overload, as patient remained >10L positive throughout
length of stay.  Fluid removal with diuresis (ethacrynic acid
and later lasix) was not effective due to patient's developed
ARF during hospital stay.  CVVH was started with gentle fluid
removal as patient's blood pressure tolerated (as patient was on
levophed pressors for BP support).  Attempts made at vent
weaning were met with decrease paO2 or respiratory acidosis on
ABG - therefore, patient was maintained with as low FiO2 and
PEEP as ABG would tolerate. Patient's breathing became
completely ventilator-dependent, and decision was made by family
to not withdraw care but to keep patient comfortable.

2.)  ID:  As mentioned above, patient suffered from VAP +MRSA
from sputum cx [**7-2**] and treated with 14 day course of
Vancomycin.  Also with subsequent sputum cx [**7-12**] +pseudomonas
and treated with gentamicin->merapenem.  Other infections
include repeatedly +urine cx for yeast = [**Female First Name (un) **] albicans,
treated with 7 day course fluconizole.  Also C. Diff+ [**7-11**] and
treated with flagyl.  Blood cxs remained negative throughout
hospital course.  Maintnance LFTs sent in ICU to r/o obstruction
and were negative.  Sacral Decub ulcer was checked daily without
signs of infection.
Patient defervesced and antibiotics were withdrawn when course
was completed. Once patient became completely
ventilator-dependent and it was realized that all medical
efforts would be futile, no further antibiotics were
administered, and patient was kept comfortable on ventilator per
wish of family.

3.)  Hypotension:  Pt with hypotension on initial presentation
to ICU, initially responsive to fluid boluses.  With fever
spike/septic picture on [**7-2**] hypotension returned requiring
pressor support.  Initially started on dopamine (as patient was
bradycardic), but then became tachycardic w/ afib/flutter -
therefore pressor was changed to levophed with good HR control.
Wean was attempted, but was not successful, especially after
starting CVVH with fluid removal, and patient remained on
levophed pressor for BP support. Due to hypotension, patient
received significant amount of fluids. Pressors were
discontinued along with all non-essential medications once
