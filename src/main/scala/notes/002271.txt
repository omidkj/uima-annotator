Service:  FENARD ICU

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Eighty-year-old male admitted
[**9-3**] for nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.  Apparently had
been on Augmentin in the past for foot infection.  Upon
arrival to the ED found to be hypotensive, but responding to
IV fluids.  Started on Vancomycin, levofloxacin, and Flagyl.
Admitted to the floor, where he had a relatively
uncomplicated course for the first few days. Stool came back
positive for Clostridium difficile and he was treated for
that.

On [**9-9**] p.m., patient became acutely confused and had
declining mental status.  Gas drawn at the time revealed a pH
of 7.17 believed to be related to metabolic acidosis.  Also
found to be hypotensive at the same time.  He was intubated
for continued respiratory acidosis.  Was started on Dopamine
and transferred to the Intensive Care Unit.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. CAD status post CABG.
2. Ischemic cardiomyopathy with an EF of 20-30% with severe
MR.
3. Dual lead pacemaker.
4. Chronic renal failure.
5. Right hip repair in [**Month (only) 216**] of this year.
6. Left cataract surgery.

MEDICATIONS UPON TRANSFER:
1. Levofloxacin 250 p.o. q.d.
2. Vancomycin 500 mg q 4 hours.
3. Zofran.
4. Bumex 2 p.o. b.i.d.
5. Senna.
6. Colace.
7. Atrovent.
8. Albuterol.
9. Digoxin 0.25 Monday and Friday.
10. Metoprolol.
11. Flagyl 500 p.o. t.i.d.
12. Trazodone.
13. Zocor.
14. Flomax.
15. Enalapril 10 mg p.o. q.d.
16. Neurontin 300 mg p.o. q.d.
17. Lopressor 12.5 mg p.o. b.i.d.

PHYSICAL EXAM UPON ARRIVAL TO THE ICU:  Weight 57 kg.
Temperature 98.  Blood pressure 120/40.  Heart rate of 80.
General:  Sedated and intubated.  Fair air movement with
crackles throughout.  Unable to appreciate JVD.  S1, S2, [**1-19**]
holosystolic murmur.  Abdomen is soft, nontender, and
nondistended, normoactive bowel sounds.  Extremities reveal
profound anasarca.

LABORATORIES ON ADMISSION:  Significant for a white count of
11.2, hemoglobin 31, platelets 150, creatinine of 2.8.

BRIEF HOSPITAL COURSE:  Patient is admitted to the Intensive
Care Unit in the context of hypotension, metabolic acidosis.
This was believed to be due to an overwhelming infection and
he was volume resuscitated.  However, continuing volume
resuscitation, probably led to worsening of his congestive
heart failure.  His creatinine continued to rise leading to a
value of 3.0.

He was eventually extubated, and was able to maintain decent
oxygenation.  On the night of [**9-11**], the patient developed
new episodes of hypotension.  At the same time, his sputum
was growing Staphylococcus aureus.  He was on broad-spectrum
antibiotics throughout hospital stay including Vancomycin,
ceftazidime, levofloxacin, and Flagyl.  Patient initially
responded to dopamine, but as the day progressed and
particularly [**9-12**], he had continuous episodes of hypotension
not responding to IV fluids.  He was started on dopamine as
well as norepinephrine with very minimal effect.

At this point, he suffered an asystolic arrest, and despite
resuscitative efforts, he expired around 10 a.m. on [**9-12**].
