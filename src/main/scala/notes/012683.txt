Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1990**]
Chief Complaint:
dyspnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation
Right sided internal jugular central venous line


History of Present Illness:
This is a 55 year old male with multiple prior admissions for
COPD exacerbations, hx of CAD s/p MI and 2-vessel CABG, and long
history of medication and O2 noncompliance, who called EMS in
respiratory distress after 1-2 days of increased dyspnea and was
found altered and confused. On arrival to the ED, he was
"minimally responsive" and started on BiPAP breifly, but was
requesting intubation.  After BiPAP did not seem to resolve his
dyspnea, he was intubated.  In the ED, he was given Solumedrol
125mg, Vanco/Ceftriaxone/Levaquin, MDI treatments, as well as
Versed and Fentanyl while intubated. Blood cx's drawn x2, one
before abx and one after some abx given. With high PaCO2 on ABG
(7.18 / 73 / 400 / 29), RR increased from 14 to 22. Peep 5, TV
500ml, FiO2 40%. The following ABG showed improvement: 7.24 / 61
/ 82 / 27 on TV 500, RR 22, PEEP 5, and ?FiO2.  Baseline PaCO2
in high 50s-60s. An EJ was placed, but was subsequently lost, so
an add'l PIV was placed.  He then developed hypotension, CVL was
placed, and was started on norepinephrine. He had received a
total of 5L IVF.  CXR showed no infiltrate, ET in proper
placement.
.
He was previously admitted on [**2152-11-15**] with a severe COPD
exacerbation
with desats to 60s on RA and subsequent intubation and
mechanical ventilation.  He was covered with vancomycin and
levofloxacin for MRSA pneumonia.  After three days on mechanical
ventilation, he was extubated without issue and discharged on
antibiotics and a prednisone taper.  He was then re-admitted
with a recurrent MRSA pneumonia on [**2152-12-4**], treated with
Linezolid for 14-day course due to presumed recurrence/treatment
failure in setting of his previous antibiotic regimen.
.
Of note, during this hospitalization in early [**Month (only) 404**], a family
meeting was held to help address the patient's recurrent
hospitalizations.  His medication noncompliance, persistent
smoking habit, and refusal to wear his oxygen on a daily basis
were all addressed.  He apparently recognized that he needs to
change his ways before he becomes fatally ill and agreed to have
VNA services help him out at home.  At this point, his code
status was changed from DNR to full code.

ROS: Unable to perform due to patient's sedated state

Urine culture: No growth.

Blood culture: No growth to date.
.
EKG: Sinus tachycardia. Biatrial enlargement. Cannot exclude
prior anteroseptal wall myocardial infarction, age
indeterminate. Compared to the previous tracing of [**2152-12-12**] the
heart rate is faster. There may be slight loss of R waves in the
anteroseptal leads. Clinical correlation is suggested. This may
be secondary to lead positioning versus interim anteroseptal
wall myocardial infarction. Biatrial enlargement is now
apparent.
.
CXR ([**2153-1-6**]): 1. Standard positioning of the endotracheal tube
and nasogastric tube. 2. Ill-defined opacity within the right
mid lung field persists, compatible with an area of resolving
pneumonia.
CXR ([**2153-1-7**]): No evidence of pneumothorax. Status post
extubation. No focal parenchymal opacity suggesting pneumonia.
Normal size of the cardiac
silhouette.


Brief Hospital Course:
55 yo M with severe COPD on home O2, CAD, poor medication and
oxygen compliance with recurrent hypercarbic respiratory failure
due to a COPD exacerbation requiring intubation, hospital course
complicated by DVT in the left brachial vein.

The patient has had multiple hospitalizations for dyspnea within
the past year with his most recent intubation in [**Month (only) 1096**] of
[**2151**] due to MRSA pneumonia.  He has a history of medication and
home O2 noncompliance.  His COPD remains very poorly controlled
as a result. On admission this time, he developed severe
shortness of breath and wheezing requiring intubation for
hypercarbic respiratory failure due to a COPD exacerbation. He
was started of pulse dose IV steroids, broad spectrum
antibiotics and nebs. The patient clinically improved, was
extubated, placed on an oral steroid taper with a 7 day total
course of levofloxacin monotherapy and ongoing nebulizer,
steroid inhaler and oxygen use.

The patient complained of left arm swelling and was found to
have a left brachial vein thrombus. He was started on systemic
anticoagulation with warfarin without complication.

The remainder of the [**Hospital 228**] medical problems including CAD,
HLD, HTN and back pain were stable.

This pt. has had repeated hospitalizations for COPD
exacerbations.  I tried to have him admitted to a pulmonary
rehabilitation program, however, medicare declined to cover this
given his level of function at the time of evaluation.
