Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Flagyl / Heparin Agents / Levofloxacin

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 898**]
Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**3-11**] Placement of IVC filter.

History of Present Illness:
67 yo with recent history of diverticular abscess (s/p IR
drainage [**2-21**]) and HIT developed during that admission who
presented to an OSH ED with dyspnea.

On day of admission, in the OSH ED was found to have bilateral
segmental PEs and was noted to have a BP of 80/50.  She was
transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED and had the following vitals 99% 4L
NC,  SBP 100-140.  Due to her HIT allergy, she was started on
lepiridun and transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for initiation of
lepirudin and close monitoring.  On arrival in [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], patient
comfortable with unremarkable vital signs.

Brief history of illness:  Patient presented to PCP after
experiencing several days of increasing severe abdominal pain,
diagnosed with diverticulitis and diverticular abscess by CT at
[**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**].  CT guided drainage of abscess at [**Hospital1 18**] [**Location (un) 86**] [**2-21**],
transferred back to [**Location (un) 620**] for remainder of IV abx therapy
(Levo/Flagyl).

On discharge from hospital [**2-29**], patient was transitioned to po
antibiotic regimen including levo+flagyl.  On [**3-1**], patient
developed an impressive morbilliform rash on her trunk, visited
primary surgeon the next day who removed flagyl antibiotic,
suspecting this was cause of drug rash, given prednisone course
+ benadryl.  Since this time, maintained on levofloxacin
monotherapy.

Patient's rash improved slightly in interim [**3-1**] - present, but
did not completely disappear off Flagyl.  On admission to the ER
today, patient had sudden increase of area and hue of rash,
becoming increasingly bright erythema with mild pruritis.
Patient notes that this was after receiving IV levofloxacin in
the ER.

Social History:

recent travel nor exposures.

Family history significant for mother who died in 80's of MI.
Father with adult-onset diabetes.

Physical Exam:

Gen: Alert, pleasant, well.
HEENT: Anicteric, MMM, OP clear.
Neck: Supple, no LAD.
Heart: RRR, nl S1, S2, no extra sounds.
Lungs: CTA bilaterally.
Abd: Soft, NT, ND, drain in place in LLQ.
Ext: Trace pedal edema, 2+ distal pulses.
Skin: Blanching, morbilloform rash on central chest, back,
spreading to bilateral upper arms, upper legs.


Pertinent Results:
[**2144-3-13**] ECHO: 1. The left atrium is mildly dilated.  2. Left
ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and systolic function
are normal (LVEF>55%). Regional left ventricular wall motion is
normal.  3. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal.  4. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. 5. There is borderline
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. 6. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.  7. Compared with the
findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2144-3-10**], RV
function may have improved, although it is difficult to compare
to the previous suboptimal study.
.
[**2144-3-12**] IVC filter placement: 1. Successful placement of a
Gunther Tulip retrievable inferior vena cava filter in the
infrarenal position. This filter may be retrieved, if indicated,
within 2 weeks of placement. 2. The venogram demonstrated a
single patent inferior vena cava with no evidence of intracaval
thrombosis. Flow voids from the renal veins indicated patency of
the renal veins bilaterally. 3. This filter should be removed
within the next 2 weeks. If removing filter within this
timeframe is not feasible, consider repositioning of the filter
for a later removal.
.
[**2144-3-10**] Bilateral lower extremity ultrasound: Deep venous
thrombosis involving the left common femoral and popliteal
veins.
.
[**2144-3-10**] ECHO:
Suboptimal image quality. The left atrium is elongated. Due to
suboptimal
technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be
fully excluded.  Overall left ventricular systolic function
appears normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular systolic function
appears depressed. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is an anterior space which most likely
represents a fat pad, though a loculated anterior pericardial
effusion cannot be excluded.
.
[**2144-3-9**]: AP UPRIGHT CHEST PLAIN FILM:  The heart size is normal.
The aortic contour appears ectatic.  Remaining mediastinal
contours are unremarkable.  The lungs are clear.  There are no
pleural effusions.
IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary processes.

Brief Hospital Course:
67 yo with recent history of diverticular abscess (s/p
drainage), HIT who presents with pulmonary embolism.  Given
history of heparin induced thrombocytopenia, started on
lepirudin - now on argatroban.  Antimicrobial therapy is
complicated by appearance of drug rash.
.
1. PE: Left leg DVT seen on U/S seems like the most likely
source - likely from venous stasis due to recent immobility
following her diverticular abscess and drainage placement.  TTE
showed some depressed RV function but was of poor technical
quality.  Has been hemodynamically stable after getting IVF [**3-11**].
 Will encourage po intake, supplement with IVF if needed.
Lepirudin switched to argatroban [**3-11**] (after placement of filter
- did not want to reinitiate lepirudin due to risk of
anaphylaxis), started coumadin evening of [**3-10**] - overlapped with
argatroban and coumadin per protocol in front of chart.
Currently therapeutic on coumadin.  Filter to stay in place for
at least two weeks - will need to be repositioned if needed for
longer.
.
2. Diverticular abscess: Patient needs broad GI gram neg.
coverage.  Came in on levofloxacin monotherapy, but given recent
increase in drug rash today (off flagyl), started on zosyn
([**3-9**]).  Continue zosyn likely until abdominal surgery.
.
3. Rash: Unclear source although suspect drug induced - likely
flagyl but also potentially levo. Drug rash stable. Treated with
prednisone 60 x 3 days, atarax for pruritus.
.
4. HTN: Continued diovan, lasix with holding parameters.
.
5. GERD: Continue PPI.
.
6. H/o gout: Continue allopurinol.
.
7. F/E/N: Low residue diet.
.
8. PPX: PPI, argatroban/coumadin (no heparin), bowel regimen,
RISS with prednisone.
.
9. Code: Full.
