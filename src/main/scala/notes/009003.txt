Attending:[**Doctor First Name 2080**]
Chief Complaint:
Transfer from outside hospital for management of intracranial
mass.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
1. Neurosurgical drainage of brain abscess [**2138-8-7**].


History of Present Illness:
Ms [**Known lastname 40230**] is a 39-year-old woman with history of diabetes, IVDU
(ongoing), recently discharged ([**2138-7-10**]) from [**Hospital1 18**] for MRSA
aortic valve endocarditis complicated with endopthalmitis,
septic emboli, and SAH. She is being transferred from OSH for
management of brain abscess.

Recent [**Hospital1 18**] hospitalization [**6-29**] - [**7-10**] for MRSA endocarditis.
She had presented for severe headache x3 days, "fogginess" of
left eye, intermittent right arm twitching, and right sided
numbness of face, arm, body and leg. Found to have aortic valve
vegetation on TEE and MRSA bacteremia. She was found to have a
subarachnoid hemorrhage, thought to be possibly mycotic
aneurysm. This was managed conservatively with pain control
(Tylenol, oxycodone SR, Dilaudid for breakthrough, and
verapramil for prophylaxis) and seizure prophylaxis (Phenytoin
250 [**Hospital1 **] started for total 4-week course). Had evidence of septic
cerebral emboli on brain MRI imaging, and she was started on
vancomycin with course to end in the second week of [**Month (only) **].
The infection was further complicated by endophalmitis for which
she underwent vitrectomy and intravitreous vancomycin injection.
Blood cultures cleared on [**7-4**]. A PICC was placed on [**7-8**]. From
[**Hospital1 18**] she went to [**Hospital **] hospital for antibiotic
administration, then to [**Hospital 46555**] rehab.

Patient saw ophthalmology a few weeks after discharge [**2138-7-25**],
which revealed clear right eye vitreous fluid and scarring of
prior infection. Right eye vision is still at finger count
level. They d/c-ed her scopolamine drops and began taper of her
Pred Forte drops to twice a day.

Had recent PICC line infection growing Alcaligenes so PICC was
removed and IJ replaced.

She was in rehab until she developed persistent fevers (on and
off for a week)/headaches/chest pain/SOB, and was admitted to
[**Hospital3 7362**]. An MRI there showed a new left parietal abscess
measuring 1.6 x 1.7 x 2.9. Also [**12-9**] blood cultures grew GNR, for
which she was started on ceftazidime.

Per OSH report, patient had asthma exacerbation in days prior to
transfer, requiring 65%FM with nasal cannula. She was initially
in the OSH ICU, where she was started on nebs and intravenous
Solumedrol. She was also given 1 dose of Lasix. Vitals at time
of transfer are BP 118/79, sat 92% 2L, HR 80, afebrile,
otherwise normal exam. Her antibiotics at time of transfer are
ceftazadime day 4, and vancomycin from her prior admission.
Cultures from [**7-29**] were negative, per OSH.

At OSH patient was seen by ID and neurosurgery - team felt that
she should be transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] given the complexity of her
recent medical history and the fact that she has received most
of her recent care at [**Hospital1 18**].

Past Medical History:
--diabetes mellitus
--polysubstance abuse including EtOH
--EtOH withdrawal seizures in the past
--asthma
--hepatitis C infection
--MRSA aortic valve endocarditis [**6-/2138**] complicated with
endophalmitis, SH, septic emboli, right sided weakness and
numbness

Social History:
Patient lives with her boyfriend and his mother. She has three
children with part-time custody with her ex-husband. She used IV
heroin and cocaine recently. She smokes 1 ppd x20 years.

Family History:
Father had CAD and CHF. Mother has HTN. Sister has DM and
Cushings.
