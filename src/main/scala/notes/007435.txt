Chief Complaint:
fever, abdominal pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
77M s/p colectomy and liver resection presents with fever,
hypotension and abdominal pain. The pt. initially presented in
[**2164**] with bright red blood per rectum, abdominal pain, and
weight loss, which led to an emergent colon resection in [**State 108**]
for an obstructing mass with ulceration within the colon.  This
mass revealed moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma with
clear margins and 5 nodes were sent and 0 of 5 lymph nodes
involved.  A staging CT scan at that time was negative for
metastasis.  He had a CEA of 1.3 back in [**2164**] and then underwent
adjuvant 5-FU with leucovorin beginning in [**2164-5-8**] through
[**2164-10-8**].  He completed 6 cycles of this chemotherapy.
Mr. [**Known lastname 1007**] had a surveillance colonoscopy on [**2165-2-20**], which
revealed more than 10 mixed non-bleeding polyps throughout his
entire colon.  These were found to be adenomas by pathology and
he subsequently underwent subtotal colectomy on [**2165-7-23**]. He
underwent surgery on [**2169-6-20**] and had an extended right
hepatic lobectomy, cholecystectomy and extensive lysis of
adhesions.  The specimen within the liver revealed metastatic,
moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma consistent with colon
primary.  Started chemotherapy [**10-16**] with Xeloda and Oxaliplatin.


Patient has been feeling poorly for approx 1 week with, fevers,
chills, aching. Called oncologist's office reporting 6 days of
general
malaise, arthralgias, myalgias, fever, and mild cough.  He also
has decreased appetite and diarrhea.  He reports being "in bed
for 6 days" but had not sought medical attention. On arrival to
ED, T 102 R 93, 96% 2LNC BP 114/73, 2 Large Bore IV's placed.
patient received NS 1000cc x6,  Patient received Unasyn 3gm x 1,
Vanc 1gm x 1, Zosyn 4.5mg IV x1. Underwent CT Abd. Had BM x1
described as diarrhea, tylenol 650mg PO.  Surgery was consulted
that stated that there was no acute surgical process.

Upon arrival to the unit, the pt was resting comfortably.
Complains of mild RUQ pain. Denies CP/SOB. Reports that his
chemotherapy regimen was stopped one week ago for side effects
of rash. Reports chronic diarrhea but no change from baseline.

IMAGING:

CXR: Lungs are clear without evidence of pneumonia or CHF. There
is
basilar atelectasis. There is no pneumothorax or pleural
effusion. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal. The aorta
is somewhat ectatic. There are surgical clips at the GE
junction, likely due to previous fundoplication. There are
calcified splenic granulomas and surgical clips in the left
upper quadrant. The bones are unremarkable. Imp: No acute
intrathoracic process.

CT Abd/Pelvis without contrast [**11-7**]: Long segment of abnormally
thickened right sided distal small bowel proximal to colonic
pelvic anastomosis. Diff. dx includes ischemia, as well as
infection/inflammatory

CT abd/pelvis with po and IV contrast [**11-10**] - Mild decrease in
the thickening of the small bowel loops in the right abdomen.
Mucosal enhancement of these bowel loops excludes ongoing
ischemia, but reperfusion injury can not be excluded. Infectious
etiologies of the small
bowel are more likely though. No perforation or abscess.


Brief Hospital Course:
1) Fevers/abdominal pain: Presented with fevers and R sided
abdominal pain. CT abd/pelvis without contrast revealed
thickening of the small bowel prior to the anastamosis site as
well as surrounding inflammatory changes. Surgery was consulted
who felt that findings were unlikely secondary to anastomotic
failure and that there were no acute surgical issues. He was
given broad spectrum IV antibiotics, IVFs for SBPs in the 70-80s
and admitted to the MICU. In the MICU, the pt was further fluid
resuscitated and received approximately at total of 13 L of IVFs
during his ED and MICU course. Anti-hypertensives were held and
the patient never required pressors. He was placed on IV
vancomycin, zosyn, and flagyl and stools cultures were sent
which were significant for C diff neg X 1. He was transferred
out of the ICU to the medical floor where he underwent a CT
abd/pelvis with IV and po contrast (once ARF had resolved) per
surgery recs which showed some resolution of the previously seen
small bowel wall thickening prior to the anastomosis site with
mucosal enhancement preserved, thus making the possibility of
ischemic bowel less likely. An infectious or inflammatory
process was most likely. Further stool cultures were negative
for C diff neg X 2, and were also negative for Salmonella,
shigella, E Coli O157:H7, Campylobacter, and O&P negative. A
viral process was thought to be most likely, but as stool cxs
were not entirely finalized at the time of discharge, he was
discharged home on a 7 day course of po ciprofloxacin. In terms
of the remaining fever work-up, urine and blood cultures were
negative.

2) Hyponatremia: Na 132 from baseline of 140s, in setting of
elevated Cr 1.8 from baseline 0.8. on admission. Hyponatremia
thought to be due to hypovolemia and resolved with IVFs.

3) ARF: Cr 1.8 from baseline of 0.8 - 1.2 on admission. Etiology
likely prerenal from dehydration vs. ATN from hypotension. Cr
trended downward to 1.1 at the time of discharge with IVFs. The
patient was given IVF with HCO3 and mucomyst prior to contrast
administration for CT abd/pelvis .

4) Metastatic colon CA: Xeloda recently discontinued prior to
admission due to rash. Further plan per the pt's primary
oncology team.
FEN: NPO for now, replete lytes PRN

5) Anemia: Hct 31 on admission and trended downward to 24 in the
setting of 13L IVFs. There were no signs of GI bleeding and the
patient remained HD stable. At the time of discharge, repeat Hct
29.
