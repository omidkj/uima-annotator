History of Present Illness:
65 y/o male who underwent coronary artery bypass graft x 3 on

Physical Exam:
VS: 74 20 130/80 5'7" 215#
Gen: Well-appearing male in NAD
HEENT: EOMI, PERLL, NC/AT
Neck: Supple, FROM, -JVD, -bruit
Chest: CTAB -w/r/r
Heart: RRR -c/r/m/g
Abd: Soft-, NT/ND, +BS and obese
Ext: Warm, well-perfused, -edema, -varicosities
Neuro: MAE, non-focal, A&O x 3

Pertinent Results:
[**4-22**] CXR: Decreased right-sided pulmonary edema with improved
right lower lobe atelectasis and stable left lower lobe
atelectasis.
[**4-15**] Echo: Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall
motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). The right
ventricular cavity is mildly dilated. Right ventricular systolic
function is normal. There is no aortic valve stenosis. Trace
aortic regurgitation is seen. Trivial mitral regurgitation is
seen. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is
mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion. IMPRESSION: Mildly dilated right ventricle
with preserved global biventricular systolic function. Moderate
tricuspid regurgitation. Mild pulmonary hypertension. Compared
with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2176-7-26**], the right
ventricle is slightly more dilated. Otherwise, no change.
[**4-15**] Chest CT: Pulmonary embolism through the right upper and
right lower lobes. Stable left lower lobe partial collapse.
Findings in the right lung are most likely due to asymmetric
pulmonary edema. Small right pneumothorax. Small stable left
pleural effusion. Small hiatal hernia.
[**4-15**] LE U/S: No evidence of DVT in either lower extremity.
[**4-14**] Chest CT: 1. Extensive small pulmonary emboli to the right
upper and right lower lobes. Relative sparing of the right
middle lobe. Some of these are chronic in appearance. 2.
Associated airspace abnormalities can represent infarction or
pneumonia or both. 3. Left lower lobe partial collapse. 4.
Evidence of recent sternotomy. 5. Small left pleural effusion.
6. Small hiatal hernia.
[**2176-4-10**] Echo: PRE PERICARDIECTOMY: Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). The left ventricular
cavity is small. Regional left ventricular wall motion is
normal. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal. There is a large pericardial effusion which appears
loculated, compressing on the inferior wall of the left
ventricle . The effusion is echo dense, consistent with blood,
inflammation or other cellular elements. There are no
echocardiographic signs of tamponade. Mild to moderate ([**1-2**]+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. No atrial septal defect is seen by
2D or color Doppler. There are simple atheroma in the aortic
arch. There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic
aorta. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. Trace
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Mild to moderate mitral regurgitation present.
POST PERICARDIECTOMY: The loculated effusion is no longer
present with resolution of the inferior wall compression. The
mitral regurgitation is somewhat improved and appears to be mild
now. The rest of the exam is unchanged from pre
periocardiectomy.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 56963**] was a same day admit after undergoing all
pre-operative work-up as an outpatient. On [**4-10**] he was brought
to the operating room where he underwent a redo-sternotomy with
drainage of old pericardial effusion and partial pericardectomy.
Please see operative report for details. Following surgery he
was transferred to the CSRU for invasive monitoring in stable
condition. Later on op day he was weaned from sedation, awoke
neurologically intact and extubated. His pre-op meds were
restarted and was started on beta blockers and diuretics as
well. He was gently diuresed towards his pre-op weight. Later on
post-op day one he was transferred to the telemetry floor. On
post-op day two his chest tubes were removed. On post-op day two
and three he was c/o of some shortness of breath and required
additional oxygen support via nasal canula secondary to room
oxygen sats of 87-91%. Mr. [**Known lastname 56964**] shortness of breath
progressively worsened and on post-op day four a chest CT
revealed a pulmonary embolism. He was transferred back to the
CSRU and early on post-op day six he re-intubated for worsening
hypoxia. A bronchoscopy was performed and he was started on IV
heparin. Pulmonary and hematology were consulted on this day as
well. His WBC was also elevated and blood cultures were taken
and he was started on broad spectrum antibiotics. Infectious
disease and Rheumatology were consulted on post-op day six. He
remained intubated for several more days while recovering from
the pulmonary embolism. Antibiotics were stopped after blood
cultures came back negative. On post-operative day nine he was
weaned from sedation, awoke neurologically intact ant extubated.
Over next couple of days he received aggressive pulmonary toilet
and required hi-[**Last Name (un) **] O2. Coumadin was started and was titrated
during his hospital until his INR was therapeutic. His
respiratory condition slowly improved and was doing well on
post-op day fourteen and transferred back to the telemetry
floor. While on the floor he worked with physical therapy to
regain his strength and mobility. Cleared for discharge to rehab
on POD ........... Target INR is 2.0- 3.0.
