EGD 10/6
Esophagus:
 Protruding Lesions 3 cords of grade III varices were seen in
the middle third of the esophagus and lower third of the
esophagus. The varices were not bleeding. There was no stigmata
of recent bleeding.
Stomach:
 Mucosa: Diffuse continuous granularity, friability, erythema
and congestion of the mucosa with no bleeding were noted in the
whole stomach. These findings are compatible with portal
hypertensive gastropathy.
 Protruding Lesions Protuding varices, with stigmata of recent
bleeding were seen in the fundus. There was no active bleeding.
The varices were not injected or banded given high risk
location, lack of ongoing bleeding and need for further
assessment of abdominal vasculature in order to determine
appropriate further plan of care.
Duodenum:
 Mucosa: Diffuse continuous granularity, friability, erythema
and congestion of the mucosa with contact bleeding were noted in
the whole examined duodenum compatible with hypertensive
duodenopathy.
Impression: Varices at the middle third of the esophagus and
lower third of the esophagus
Granularity, friability, erythema and congestion in the whole
stomach compatible with portal hypertensive gastropa
