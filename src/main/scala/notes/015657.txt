Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2704**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest Pain, Abdominal Pain, Nausea/Vomiting, Right Leg Numbness

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubated on [**2146-9-16**]

History of Present Illness:
 This is a 59 y.o. male who was initially seen at [**Hospital3 62353**] on [**2146-9-14**] for abdominal pain, chest pain, and
nausea starting that morning. He also noted numbness in his
right leg with this presentation. He denied fevers, chills, or
emesis. During this admission he became agitated, irritable, but
maintained by behavioral redirection. He was started on CIWA
protocal for history of heavy drinking per his girlfriend. [**Name (NI) **]
received Valium at this time. He was found to have a type B
aortic dissection per imaging and transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] for
evaluation and management. He again became combative upon
arrival and was sedated and intubated on [**2146-9-16**]. Vascular
surgery consulted on [**2146-9-14**] and recommended [**Year (4 digits) **] pressure
control with close monitoring for end organ ischemia.
Neurosurgery consulted on [**2146-9-16**] for possible subdural
hemmorhage on CT. Recomended seizure protocol and frequent
neurological evaluations. Patient had a repeat head CT which
showed no signs of subdural hemmorage at that time. Patient was
on moderate sedation and on [**2146-9-16**] became febrile,
hypertensive, and combative requiring physicial restraints. At
this time he was placed on propofol and intubated. PICC line
placed on [**2146-9-16**].

On initial review of symptoms per initial notes, he denied any
prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary
embolism, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools. He denied
recent fevers, chills or rigors. He denied exertional buttock or
calf pain. All of the other review of systems were negative. At
time of this exam patient was intubated and unable to
communicate a review of systems.

Cardiac review of systems was notable for chest pain at initial
presentation to OSH. He denied dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal
nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope
or presyncope.  During tranfer, the patient was intubated and
could not communicate.


Past Medical History:
Vascetomy in the past

Social History:
Patient stated he drinks 2 glasses of wine on the weekends. Upon
further discussion with the girlfriend, he had been drinking on

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient was transferred to the CCU on Hospital day 6 from the
MICU. The patient was seen and evaluated in the MICU by the CCU
team prior to transfer. The patient was transferred in a guarded
condition.
.
Hospital Course By System:
   1. Vascular: Patient was initially admitted to the vascular
service. He was evaluated and it was determined that surgical
intervention in his case is not warranted at this time. His
management has consisted of [**Month/Day/Year **] pressure control, and
monitoring for signs of vascular compromise. Initial management
of hypertension required multiple PO medications in combination
with IV antihypertensives. Initially due to the rising creatine
in the setting of vascular compromise to one or both kidneys,
ACEi and ARBs were held due to concern about further
hypoperfusion to the kidney. Renal medicine was consulted on
[**9-27**] and approved the use of an ACEi. The patient responded
well to this and was able to remove all IV antihypertensive
medications. His pressure has remained stable with occasional
elevations in systolic [**Month/Year (2) **] pressures related to agitation in
periods of light sedation. Quality of pulses were followed and
saw improvement in right lower extremety pulses over his
hospitalization. Lactate levels were drawn along with serial
abdominal exams to evaluate for signs of bowel ischemia. He was
guaiac negative and had no other signs of acute bowel ischemia.
Extremeties remained warm with good capillary refill. Creatine
stabilized with a maximum value of 2.1 on hospital day 12.  On
discharge the creatinine had trended down to 1.2.  No signs of
acute ischemic injury to the carotid arteries. During physical
therapy and daily ambulation, he denies any claudication or
numbness to either legs. Renal perfusion scan performed on [**10-5**]
showed 29% function in the right kidney and 71% of renal
function performed by the left kidney. Pt was slowly weaned off
bp medications as his agitation and kidney function improved.
He was discharged on Propanolol 160mg [**Hospital1 **], Amlodipine 10mg
daily, and Lisinopril 10mg po bid for [**Hospital1 **] pressure management.
He will follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in Cardiology and Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **]. Patient will make a follow up appointment with a
PCP in the [**Location (un) 5503**] area.  On discharge pt's bllod pressure
was [**Last Name (un) 74635**] well controlled at 110s/70s.
.
   2. Respiratory: Patient was initially intubated on [**9-16**] for
increasing agitation and poor [**Month/Year (2) **] pressure control secondary
to the agitation. During the first days of the admission, he
became increasingly agitated and at time of intubation, required
4 security guards to restrain him for his own safety. He was
initially started on AC but switched to SIMV+PS as tolerated. On
[**9-18**] chest x-ray showed signs of a right middle lobe
infiltrate. He was started on Vancomycin, Levofloxican, and
Zosyn for broad coverage. Culture results indicated the presence
of streptococcus pneumoniae (oxacillin sensitive) and Moraxella
Catastalsis. Antibiotic regimen was changed to Zosyn only and
dosed appropriately for renal function. Patient completed the 10
day course on [**9-30**]. Ventilator settings were decreased as
tolerated in anticipation of weaning the ventilator and the
patient was successfully extubated on [**9-30**]. Repeat CXRs showed
gradual improvement in lung function and resolving infiltrates.
Patient had spiked another fever on [**9-30**] with worsening CXR and
noted infiltrates. He was started on Vancomycin and Ceftazidime
for 7 day course. At time of discharge there were no respiratory
issues and pt had remained afebrile without a oxygen requirement
during ambulation as well as at rest.
.
  3. DVT: On [**9-20**] the patient's right arm was disproportantly
larger and firm compared to the left arm. The patient underwent
a duplex ultrasound which showed non obstructing DVT in the
axillary vein not extending to the subclavian.
