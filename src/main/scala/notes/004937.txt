Chief Complaint:
left sided pain

History of Present Illness:
42 yo man with DM I, ESRD on HD, CHF, HTN, chronic L sided pain
with multiple admissions for the same complaints with no
identified physical etiology, who presents for acute worsening
of the the same L sided pain for 1 day. Pt was recently
hospitalized at [**Hospital1 **] and discharged for [**2121-8-16**] with left flank
pain, nausea and vomiting. He has had multiple workups in the
past including CT, MRI, and renal ultrasound all without clear
etiology. A CT scan was repeated today and was again normal.
.
Pt now presents with left sided flank pain, nausea, vomiting for
one day. The pain is similar to other admissions. Denies fever,
CP, SOB. Unable to tolerate POs [**3-20**] pain. Pain controlled with
morphine.
Pt does report that he missed his last dialysis due on Sat, [**9-27**] [**3-20**] to fatigue. Last dialysis [**9-25**].
.
In the [**Name (NI) **], pt found to have k+ of 7.9 with peaked t waves on
ECG. Pt received kayexalate, insulin with dex and calcium
gluconate. K dropped to 7.4. Renal was consulted and did
emergent HD with plans for full HD in the AM. Plan if for the
patient to go from the ED to HD, and then to the MICU for close
monitoring overnight.

Abd CT:
CT ABDOMEN WITHOUT AND WITH IV CONTRAST: There are small
bilateral pleural effusions with associated dependent
atelectasis. There are few focal areas of patchy opacities
bilaterally, which may represent atypical focal atelectasis,
however, focal areas of infiltrate cannot be excluded.

The liver, gallbladder, pancreas, spleen, adrenal glands,
kidneys are unremarkable. There is no evidence of stones or
hydronephrosis. The small and large bowel are within normal
limits. There are no pathologically enlarged lymph nodes within
the mesentery or retroperitoneum. There is no free fluid or free
air.

CT PELVIS WITHOUT AND WITH IV CONTRAST: The distal ureters and
urinary bladder are unremarkable. The prostate, rectum, sigmoid
colon are within normal limits. There is no pelvic
lymphadenopathy.
.
Ultrasound: Normal abdominal ultrasound study.
.
Stress: No ischemic symptoms/EKG changes. Nuclear report sent
separately. : Mild, fixed myocardial perfusion defect in the
inferior wall. No
reversible myocardial perfusion defects. Normal left ventricular
cavity size.
Inferior wall hypokinesis with calculated LVEF 40%.

.
CT head [**10-11**]
There is no intracranial hemorrhage, mass effect, shift of the
normally midline structures, or major vascular territorial
infarct. The [**Doctor Last Name 352**]- white matter differentiation is preserved.
There is a cavum septum pellucidum. There is no hydrocephalus.
The osseous structures are unremarkable. The paranasal sinuses
and mastoid air cells are well aerated.

CT neck [**10-11**]
The osseous structures are unremarkable. The visualized lung
apices are unremarkable. There is a small pretracheal lymph node

[**10-13**] foot ulcer
Compared with [**2120-10-13**], old fracture deformities of the second,
third and fourth distal metatarsals are noted. There is now
focal bony resorption and poor definition of the lateral cortex
of the head of the third metatarsal, as well as the lateral
corner of the base of the third proximal phalanx, worrisome for
osteomyelitis. Please correlate with the location of the
patient's plantar ulcer

Foot xray after debridement:
Interval resection bone around 35d MTP joint. Residual
osteomyelitis this area cannot be excluded

Micro:
wound Cx: MSSA and GBS sensitive to naficillin

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P:42 yo man with DM I, ESRD on HD, CHF, HTN, chronic L sided
pain admitted with L sided pain, hyperkalemia requiring urgent
dialysis.
.
.#Osteomyiltis of 3rd metatarsal-this was likely the cause of
his fevers and leukocytosis. The patient was taken to the OR and
underwent debridement. His wound cx grew out MSSA and GBS
sensitive to naficillin and he was started on this and should
continue for 4 weeks. He has a picc line in place. After
debridement and starting the patient on naficillin, the white
count normalized and he was afebrile and overall felt much
better. He has an appointment with podiatry in one week and
should have the wound covered with dry sterile gauze to be
changed daily.
.
# Depression: Pt has a hx of severe depression causing need for
hospitalizations.  After extensive work-up of his abdominal
pain, it is likely that there is a strong component of
somatization and depression contributing.  Psychiatry was
consulted and they recommended starting celexa 20mg qd to help
with the depression.  Initially, they were not recommending
inpatient stay but towards the end of his hospitalization, he
started stating that he "did not want to go on anymore" and
"could not deal with the pain anymore."  He was started on
remeron and placed on a 1:1 sitter. At the end of
hospitalization, patient did not require 1:1 sitter and denied
any suicidal ideation. Inpatient psychiatry was deemed
unecessary. He should be followed by his PCP.
.
# Abdominal Pain: CT of abdomen was done initially in the ER and
was negative for any etiology of his pain.  Pt's workup has
included abd u/s which ruled out renal vein thrombosis, negative
MRI of abdomen and multiple negative abdominal CTs.  Later in
his hospitalization, he complained of sharp RUQ pain and a stat
ultrasound was done which ruled out acute cholecystitis.  His
abdominal pain migrated between his left flank, RLQ and RUQ.  He
never had any peritoneal signs or acute abdomen and as above,
all his studies were negative.  Psych was consulted and both
medicine and psych agreed that most of his pain was somatic.
.
# Atypical Chest Pain: Pt complained of chest pain during
dialysis.  Cardiology was consulted and they recommended a PMIBI
although their suspicion for cardiac chest pain was low.  PMIBI
was done and showed LVEF of 40%, inferior wall hypokinesis and a
fixed perfusion defect in inferior wall. The patient was already
on lisinopril and metoprolol. We started him on ASA 81 mg. His
lipid profile showed an LDL of 73 and given his history of
noncompliance with new medications, we decided not to start a
statin.
.
# Hyperkalemia/ESRD: Patient missed dialysis and thus came in
with hyperkalemia.  This corrected after HD x 1.  He was
followed by renal and dialyzed T, Th, Sa.  He was continued on
