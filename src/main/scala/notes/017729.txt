CTA Abd/Pelvis [**5-22**]
1. Marked peripancreatic free fluid, which may be secondary to
acute
pancreatitis. Correlation with lab values is recommended.
2. Marked duodenal edema and mucosal hyperenhancement, could be
reactive to the adjacent acute pancreatitis.
3. Uterine fibroid.
4. Fatty liver.

CTA Torso [**5-24**]
1. Extensive peripancreatic fluid is unchanged since prior
study, consistent with history of acute pancreatitis.
2. Interval development of extensive consolidation and
ground-glass opacity in both lungs, most likely due to ARDS or
aspiration.

CTA Abdomen [**6-1**]
1. In this patient with acute pancreatitis, the extensive
peripancreatic
fluid in the anterior pararenal space extending inferiorly into
the pelvis, appear similar in size and appearance compared to
the prior study. No vascular complications are seen. No evidence
of pancreatic necrosis.
2. Improvement in the edema/ARDS and consolidative changes in
both lung
bases.
3. Mild narrowing of the origin of the celiac trunk, likely due
to
compression by the median arcuate ligament.
4. Multiple uterine fibroids.
5. Previously post-pyloric feeding tube has withdrawn, with tip
now within
the stomach.

CT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST	Study Date of [**2141-6-4**] IMPRESSION:
1. Stable extensive peripancreatic fluid collections extending
inferiorly
into the pelvis, which are unchanged in size and appearance
compared to the
prior study, likely representing pseudocysts. No evidence of
pancreatic
necrosis, hemorrhage, or vascular complication.
2. Improvement in bibasilar opacities within the lung bases.
3. Stable enlargement of the left ovary.
