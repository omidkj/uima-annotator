History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 33561**] is a 86 year-old male with ESRD on HD (MWF), HTN,
DM2, dCHF who was sent to the ED yesterday due to rectal
bleeding and hypotension.  The patient is accompanied by his
daughter (health care proxy) who is interpreting for her father
and providing history.
.
The night prior to admission ([**6-12**]) he started having three
episodes of bloody diarrhea associated with abdominal cramping.
No melena. The day of admission he had another episode of large
bloody diarrhea.  He went to dialysis and finished his full
session, but was somewhat hypotensive with BP<90, so was
referred to the ED. During dialysis patient felt lightheaded and
had low blood pressure. He was sent to the ED from dialysis.
.
On arrival to the ED he had grossly bloody stool with 700cc of
blood, SBP were in the 70's, Hct was 29.  He was given one unit
pRBC in the ED.  Addtionally he was given IVF, protonix, and
admitted to the MICU.  GI and surgery were consulted.  He
underwent a CTA of his abdomen which showed a 2.8cm
hyperenhancement in the wall of the proximal transverse colon
concerning for malignancy. Final read pending.
.
Patient had NG lavage which was negative.  He was prepped and GI
did a colonscopy which showed a mass in the distal ascending
colon as well as multiple polyps.  Biopsies were taken. He has
has serial Hcts and was tranfused second unit of pRBC in the
ICU.  Due to blood transfusion and receiving 4L of IVF, patient
started desaturating to the low 90s with crackles in the lower
lung fields therefore he was taken for another dialysis session
today with 2L out.
.
On admission, he denied dyspnea, chest pain, palpitations,
abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting.

Imaging:
CTA Abdomen and Pelvis with and without contrast: [**2168-6-13**]
1. Enhancing mass in the cecum with associated wall thickening
and features to suggest ulceration c/w new malignancy.
2. No intraluminal contrast extravasation to suggest active GI
bleeding.
3. Multiple rim-enhancing hepatic lesions concerning for
metastatic disease.
4. Proctocolitis involving rectum and sigmoid colon, could
reflect inflammatory or infectious pathology.
5. Atrophic kidneys with stable renal cysts.
6. Severe DJD throughout spine.

Colonospocy: [**2168-6-14**]
Findings: Many mixed polyps of benign appearance were found in
the whole colon mainly in transverse and decsending colon. A
ulcerated 2-3 cm mass with stigmata of recent bleeding of
malignant appearance was found in the distal ascending colon;
appeared more proximal than seen on CT. The scope traversed the
lesion. Cold forceps biopsies were performed for histology. The
lesion was tattooed.
Impression: Polyps in the whole colon mainly in transverse and
decsending colon. Mass in the distal ascending colon; appeared
more proximal than seen on CT. (biopsy)

Brief Hospital Course:
86 year-old male with ESRD on HD (MWF), HTN, DM2, dCHF presented
with hypotension in the setting of multiple episodes of bloody
diarrhea.
.
# GI Bleed: Patient presented with blood pressures in the 70s
systolic in the setting of acute GI bleeding.  He received IVFs
and one unit of transfusion in the ED with blood pressure rising
to 100s systolic.  GI and surgery were involved and patient was
admitted directly to the MICU.  Patient had a negative NG
lavage.  He then had CTA abdomen which showed an enhancing mass
in the cecum with features suggesting malignancy.  He was
prepared for colonoscopy which showed ulcerated 2-3 cm mass in
the distal ascending colon with stigmata of recent bleeding of
malignant appearance.  A biopsy was taken.  In the MICU patient
received another unit of transfusion for low hematocrit.
However he continued to be hemodynamically stable and did not
have any more bloody stools.  Before being transfered to the
floor patient received an extra session of dialysis for
desaturating in the low 90s in the setting of being volume
overloaded.  On the floor patient continued to have stable blood
pressure with no blood in the stool.   Given patient's stable
condition, the family along with different teams involved
decided to discharge patient with GI and primary care follow up
for outpatient malignancy work pending the results of the GI
biopsy. Before discharge patient was seen by physical therapy
and found to be functional.
.
# Anemia: Patient anemia is most likely from anemia of CKD
worsened with acute GI bleeding. In the past his Hct have ranged
25-30. His Hct after two units of transfusion remained stable at
28-32.
.
# Chronic Hypertension: Per patient's family patient has history
of HTN but was discontinued from oral hypertensives by PCP few
months ago because of feelings of lightheadedness and low blood
pressure post dialysis sessions.  He was not started on any
hypertensive medications in this hospitalization.
.
# Liver lesions: Given presence of ulcerated mass on
colonoscopy, the liver lesions are concerning for metastatic
cancer.  Patient will have
