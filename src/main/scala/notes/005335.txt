Service: SURGERY

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1481**]
Chief Complaint:
Abdominal pain with nausea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2154-7-5**] Laparoscopy converted to laparotomy, small-bowel
resection, and jejunostomy.


History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 805**] is 4 months after an esophago-
gastrectomy for an esophageal cancer, which was treated with
neoadjuvant treatment.  She has had a jejunostomy tube in
place.  She has had some progressive nausea and now vomiting
with dilatation of the bowel proximal to the jejunostomy
site.  There is no clear-cut evidence of cancer on a CT scan.
The patient has not responded to conservative treatment, and
therefore operation was advised and accepted by the patient.
Originally, we thought that a  laparoscopic revision of the
jejunostomy would be feasible.

Past Medical History:
Diabetes Mellitus
Hypertension
Hyperlipidemia
COPD
Esophageal Cancer s/p minimally invasive esophagectomy
Breast Cancer s/p Right mastectomy


Social History:
She has been a nonsmoker for the past year, having started at
the age of 14 and smoked up to one pack per day. She drinks an
occasional alcoholic beverage, but they are so rare she cannot
remember when her last one was.


Family History:
Her family history is negative for breast or ovarian cancer. She
had a maternal uncle with [**Name2 (NI) 499**] cancer and a maternal
grandmother with some type of cancer that spread; she is unsure
whether this could have been ovarian. There has been no prostate
or pancreatic cancers.

[**2154-6-26**]
CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: Post-surgical
changes related
to esophagectomy is present with large amount of debris and
fluid within the
distal neoesophagus. Note is made of air layering in dependent
portion of the
esophagus, which is probably intraluminal, however close
followup is
recommended as pneumatosis may have a similar appearance. The
lung bases show
bibasilar atelectasis, right greater than left. Small right
pleural effusion
is unchanged.

Within the limitations of a non-contrast exam no focal hepatic
lesion is
identified. The gallbladder is distended and there is mild
intrahepatic
biliary dilatation which may be related to fasting. There is no
gallbladder
wall thickening or pericholecystic fluid. The spleen, adrenal
glands, and
kidneys are unremarkable. The pancreas is atrophic.

The duodenum is fluid filled and dilated measuring up to 4.8 cm
with abrupt
caliber change at the anterior abdominal wall (series 2A, image
47), worrisome
for an obstruction. Given that the oral contrast was
administered via the
jejunostomy, it is difficult to determine the degree of
obstruction. The bowel
loops distal to this and the jejunostomy remain relatively
collapsed. There is
no free air or free fluid. The abdominal aorta shows
atherosclerotic
calcification however maintains a normal caliber.

CT OF THE PELVIS WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: The rectum,
sigmoid [**Month/Day/Year 499**] and
bladder are within normal limits. The vagina contains soft
tissue material
which is of uncertain etiology. Direct visualization is
recommended as a
fistulous connection to the adjacent bowel is not entirely
excluded. Small
amount of free fluid is present within the pelvis. There is no
lymphadenopathy.

BONE WINDOWS: No suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesion is
identified.
Degenerative changes are seen involving the lower lumbar spine
and bilateral
hips.

IMPRESSION:
1. The distal neoesophagus and duodenum are fluid filled and
dilated with
abrupt caliber change at the anterior abdominal wall proximal to
the
jejunostomy, worrisome for obstruction. Note is made of gas
layering in the
dependent portions of the distal esophagus, which is likely
intraluminal,
however close follow up is recommended as pneumatosis may have a
similar
appearance.

2. Soft tissue material within the vaginal canal, which is of
uncertain
significance. Recommend direct visualization as fistulous
connection to bowel
is not entirely excluded.

3. Small amount of pelvic free fluid.

4. Bibasilar atelectasis and small right pleural effusion.

[**2154-7-14**]
FINDINGS: There are dilated loops of small bowel measuring
approximately 7 cm
at its greatest diameter. There are associated air-fluid levels
noted in the
small bowel. There is no intraperitoneal free air noted. There
are
post-surgical clips noted in place. There is a nasogastric tube
with its tip
overlying the gastric shadow. These findings are consistent with
small-bowel
obstruction. There is slight increase distention from supine
portable
radiograph from [**2154-7-9**]. The visualized osseous and soft tissue
structures
are unremarkable.

IMPRESSION: Dilated loops of small bowel, slightly worse from
[**2154-7-9**]
concerning for possible small-bowel obstruction.


Brief Hospital Course:
Pt admitted to Surgical Floor on [**2154-6-26**] under Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
She was status post esophagogastrectomy with J tube placement
for adenocarcinoma and was admitted with question of bowel
obstruction after experiencing nausea, vomiting and abdominal
pain. She was made NPO and given morphine for pain control as
well as anti-emetics for nausea/vomiting. An NG tube was placed
for gastrointestinal decompression, which was later removed. A
urinalysis specimen came back positive for UTI and she was
treated with a three day course of Ciprofloxacin.

She had also reported some vaginal bleeding when initially seen
in the emergency department. Gynecology was consulted after
pelvic matter was seen in the vaginal on CT. She declined an
exam in the hospital and it was felt that outpatient follow up
with her regular gynecologist would be appropriate to further
evaluate the bleeding and pelvic matter on imaging.

For nutrition, tube feed were provided through her J tube,
however, she continued to experience intermittent nausea and
vomiting throughout the early days of her hospital stay. IV
fluids were provided for hydration. Potassium and magnesium were
provided for correction of hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia
respectively.  After her nausea and vomiting failed to improve,
the decision was made to return to the operating room on [**2154-7-5**]
for small bowel resection and J tube revision. Intraoperatively,
she was found to have widespread cancer throughout her abdomen.
Her J tube was involved by tumor; the affected portion of the
jejunum was resected and a new J tube insertion site was
created.

Atrial fibrillation: HOD 8 ([**2154-7-5**]) Prior to going to the OR the
patient developed a-fib with RVR [**12-29**] her afternoon dose of
Lopressor was held. The pt was converted to NSR with Lopressor
10mg IVP. The pt went to OR for laparoscopy converted to
laparotomy, small-bowelresection, and jejunostomy. Pt tolerated
the operation well, but developed a-fib with rapid ventricular
response. Loressor was used with success for a few hours, but
the patient continued to convert to a-fib and dropped her SBP to
90s (MAP 50s). An amiodarone
