Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7881**]
Chief Complaint:
Weakness/Fatigue

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
EP study with ablation of inferior septal reentrant circuits

History of Present Illness:
84 yo M with h/o CAD s/p CABG [**2157**] and multiple PCIs, chronic
systolic and diastolic CHF (EF 55%, but previously EF35%) s/p
[**Hospital1 **]-V/ICD with mod/severe MR, severe TR, AFib on Coumadin, slow
VT s/p partial ablation [**2173**], CKD stage IV (baseline CR 2.4-2.8)
who was is a direct admit from Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 1911**] after patient was
found to be in slow VT. In the days prior to admission pt notes
fatigue, excessive sleep, loss of appetite and leg pain.  His
weight has increased from baseline dry weight of 152lb to 157lb
over past 3 days. He denies SOB, orthopnea, PND.

On [**7-8**], he had several EP ablations of inferior septal wall
that were complicated by an episode of VT. He was cardioverted
back into sinus but it unclear if shock was external or from
ICD. Procedure also complicated by a seperate episode of
hypotension with an SBP in the low 70's. He received dopamine
and pressures normalized. He did not require intubation and
dopamine was discontinued prior to transfer.

On arrival to CCU, pt is [**Hospital1 **]-v paced, with HR72 and BP 125/58. Pt
has no compliants aside from feeling somulent.

Brief Hospital Course:
84 yo M with h/o CAD s/p CABG [**2157**] and multiple PCIs, chronic
systolic and diastolic CHF (EF 35% in past but 60% on last TTE)
s/p [**Hospital1 **]-V/ICD with mod/severe MR, severe TR, AFib on Coumadin,
slow VT s/p partial ablation [**2173**], CKD stage IV who was sent in
with malaise slightly volume overloaded, and found to be in slow
ventricular tachycardia to 80s s/p successful ventricular
ablation.

#Slow V.tach: Upon admission, patient was found to be in slow
ventricular tachycardia, and was not being paced. [**2177-7-4**]
electrophysiology was consulted interrogated pacemaker. He was
able to be paced out of rhythm by EP twice, but both attempts
were only transient as he returned into slow. Pt returned into
slow v.tach s/p repeated attempts to pace patient out of rhythm.
Amiodarone loading was attempted, but did not break slow vtach
circuit. Believed that amio was slowing his vtach to below his
device threshold, thus not allowing it to break him out of it.
Amiodarone and mexiletine were discontinued. He underwent
successful ventricular ablation to biV pacing. During the
procedure, it was noted that the LV pacer lead may not be in
optimal position, but no intervention was performed.
Subsquently, he went to the CCU were remained stable. He
remained stable overnight with BiV pacing and no further
arrhythmias or events. He was transferred back to the floor and
cleared by PT.
.
# Acute on chronic systolic and diastolic CHF: EF in the past
was 35% prompting BiV pacemaker placement, EF now improved to
40% on last TTE. Patient was slightly hypervolemic upon
admission. He was diuresed approximately 3L during the beginning
of his hospital course. Admission weight 71kg and discharge wt
apprximately 68.5. For the rest of his course he was maintained
on his home dose of of digoxin, spironolactone, aspirin,
carvedilol, torsemide. Prior to ventricular ablation, he had an
echo with contrast to better define heart border for concern for
ventricular aneurysm, 3+MR, 3+TR EF 40%. There was no evidence
for ventricular aneurysm as per echo report.
.
# Atrial fibrillation: now s/p BiV pacemaker and is primary
pacer dependent. On amiodarone for rhythm control and coumadin
for anticoagulation, INR therapeutic at 2.6 on last check on
[**2177-5-8**]. He was slightly subtherapeutic to 1.8 during admission
and required slight increase in coumadin to 3mg daily. He was
continued on amiodarone 200mg for rate control.
.
# Chronic kidney disease stage IV: Cr baseline appears to be
2.4-2.8. His Cr remained at baseline during admission.
.
Inactive Issues:
====================================
# Hypothyroidism:  He was continued on levothyroxine 100mcg at
home dose
.
Transitional Issues:
