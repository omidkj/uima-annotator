Chest Pain, SOB

History of Present Illness:
Pt is a 72 y/o male with PMHx of CAD (3 vessel disease with 100%
occlusion of the right coronary artery but good
collateralization), CHF, PVD with R stent leg, HTN, DM2, carotid
artery disease, recent PEA arrest (hospitalized at [**Hospital1 18**]) and
mod-severe AS (peak gradient of 40mmHg and an estimated valve
area of 1.0cm2) who is admitted for chest pain and shortness of
breath.  History is gathered from the patient's two daughters,
as he is too obtunded to give a history.  Per his daughters, he
had been experiencing increasing CP all week since being
discharged from rehab on [**7-31**].  Has had multiple episodes of
chest pain that came on with both rest and exertion, as well as
while sitting on the toilet trying to have BM. Associated with
diaphoresis and radiation of pain to left arm. Episodes lasted
less than an hour usually and were relieved with multiple doses
of nitro.  He also was complaining of worsening shortness of
breath, which became signficantly worse last night.  Has been
sleeping sitting up in a chair, becomes dyspneic and has chest
pain when lying flat.  Daughters also endorse PND and worsening
lower extremity edema.

Given all these symptoms, his daughters have called 911 a few
times this week, but thus far the patient had refused to go.
Today they mentioned his symptoms at a pre-op visit for CABG
planning, and they were told to call their cardiologist, who
recommended they bring him to the ER.  They brought him to
[**Hospital3 **], where he was tachypneic and tachycardic, so he
was started on BiPAP.  Nitro paste was applied, resulting in
hypotension, so paste was removed.  Cardiac enzymes at that time
were negative and ECG showed baseline LVH with "strain" pattern.
 Given that his providers were at [**Hospital1 18**] and he is scheduled to
undergo CABG here next week, he was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] ED via
med-evac flight.  While en route he started to not tolerate the
BiPAP, was given ativan 2mg IV, and subsequently became
obtunded.

On arrival to [**Hospital1 18**], initial vitals were HR: 99, BP: 179/70, and
his GCS was 7, he was satting 90% on NRB.  He was switched back
onto BiPAP given his belly breathing, poor breath sounds at
bases with crackles. He was started low dose nitro gtt with drop
in pressures again, so this was stopped.  No lasix was given in
the ED. Labs and imaging significant for Trop negative, CK: 37
MB: 2, Lactate:2.3, CXR showing volume overload from comparision
12 hours ago.

On arrival to the floor, patient was on BiPAP, sedative and
minimally responsive, GCS 12.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 111747**] is a 72 year old male with PMHx of CAD (3
vessel disease undergoing CABG work up), CHF, HTN, DM2, and
severe AS who presented with chest pain and shortness of breath
and found to have an acute CHF exacerbation.

Active Diagnoses:
#Acute on chronic diastolic CHF: The patient presented to an OSH
with chest pain and increased oxygen requirements and was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further care. On presentation to [**Hospital1 18**]
he was sedated (given Ativan at OSH), on BiBAP, poor O2
saturation on 100% non-re breather. He was admitted to the CCU
where his mental status improved. He was aggressively diuresed
and over the course of his hospitalization was negative 6.5L.
His oxygenation improved and he was weaned off BiPAP. He was
continued to be diuresed and was transitioned to oral
medication. It was felt that the chest pain and SOB was due to
this volume overload and his cardiac markers were negative. His
case was discussed with the cardiothoracic surgeons who felt
that he was stable to be discharged home and could represent to
the hospital on Thursday [**2195-8-13**] for definitive treatment (CABG
and AVR). He was discharged on 80mg PO BID of furosemide with
lab work follow-up on Tuesday [**2195-8-13**].

Chronic Diagnoses:
#CAD: He is known to have 3 vessel disease and at time of
admission was undergoing pre-surgery evaluation with a scheduled
surgery date of [**2195-8-13**]. Given his clinical improvement of his
chest pain and SOB on medical therapy it was not felt that he
needed emergent CABG. He will keep his scheduled surgery date of
[**2195-8-13**] for definitive therapy.

#HTN: The patient is known to have this diagnosis and he had
several episodes of hypertension following diuresis. His
Lisinopril was increased to 20mg PO daily and his metoprolol was
decreased to 100mg PO BID. On this oral regimen his SBP was in
the 120s-130s. He was discharged on this regimen.

#DM2: He is known to have this diagnosis and is only on oral
metformin at home. THis was held on admission over concern that
he may require a procedure with contrast. He was maintained on a
insulin sliding scale while in the hospital and was discharged
home on his home oral medication.

#Aortic Stenosis: He is known to have this diagnosis and this
complicated his care as on presentation at the OSH and [**Hospital1 18**] ed
he was given nitro (paste at OSH and drip at [**Hospital1 18**]) which caused
a drop in his blood pressure. His pressures normalized following
discontinuation of
