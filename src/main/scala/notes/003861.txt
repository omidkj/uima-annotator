Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2297**]
Chief Complaint:
SOB
Transfer for Management of Tamponade

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Pericadriocentesis with Drain Placement ([**6-13**])
Pericardial window procedure with drain ([**6-15**])
Right femoral central venous line ([**6-26**])


History of Present Illness:
   56yo F with hx of metastatic ovarian CA s/p pericardial
effusion drained on [**5-19**] is transferred for recurrence of
pericardial effusion with tamponade physiology.  The pt
initially presented to [**Hospital1 **] with shortness of breath. Was
found to have a pulsus of 15, HR 120, SBP120. ECHO at OSH
demonstrated tamponade physiology with RV collapse. Referred to
[**Hospital1 18**] for emergent pericardiocentesis. In the ED T 98.8, HR 114,
BP 131/79, RR 29, 100% on 3 LNC and facemask. At 5:00 pm,
underwent multiple sub-xyphoid punctures - 240 cc of bloody
fluid drained. Initial pericardial pressures were 13 mm and were
nearly 0 after removing the fluid. Pulsus was then 11 and HR
117.  ECHO was done following the procedure. Pt was scheduled to
see CT surgery for a window as an outpt but develop symptoms
prior to appointment.
.
Patient denied fevers, chills, N/V, or chest pain. No abd pain,
back pain. Does have leg edema. When she had a pericardial
effusion several weeks ago, developed shortness of breath as
weel, was relieved with drainage of the effusion. Had 400 + ccs
of bloody fluid drained. Shortness of breath has been slowly
worsening since her last tap.
.

.
Upon Admission to MICU [**6-26**]:
VS - T98.3, BP 117/88, HR 118, O2 95% 6L
General - sedated, barely arousable female in NAD, breathing

repeated stimulation
HEENT - pupils small and minimally reactive, patient not opening
mouth
Neck - enlarged area of left parotid with surrounding erythema
CV - 2-3/6 holosystolic murmur loudest at apex.
Chest - mild wheezes, no crackles anterially (patient will not
sit up for exam)
Abdomen - distended, multiple firms masses bilaterally, +BS,
+wound from recent pericardial drain around epigastric area,
dressing c/d/i; + ascities

Pertinent Results:
STUDIES:
EKG: sinus tachycardia at 112 bpm, LAD, TWF in I, inversion in
aVL, ? low voltage II, poor R wave progression
.
CK 23 Trop I < 0.04
.
[**2151-6-4**] ECHO: LV hyperdynamic systolic function, EF 75-80%, left
strium - normal, right strium - normal, aortic root - noral,
pericardium - moderate sized pericardial effusion with organized
material on the visceral pericardium, consistent with thrombus
or tumor, aortic valve - thickened, mitral valve - thickened,
tricuspid/pulmonic valves - normal, trace TR
.
[**2151-6-25**] CT Neck -
1.  Severe parotitis without a focal sialolith.  Etiology may be
infectious, related to chemotherapy, or idiopathic in nature.
No stone is identified.  Several lymph nodes are seen in the
region of the enlarged left parotid gland, some of which may be
reactive in nature.
2.  Extensive lymphadenopathy seen throughout the neck and
superior
mediastinum as well as the right axilla.  Likely, these findings
are all metastatic in nature.  Many of these lymph nodes are
calcified and may relate to psammomatous calcification given
history of ovarian cancer.
3.  Soft tissue nodules in the right anterior chest and upper
right back are also likely metastatic in nature.
4.  Diffuse lung metastases and probable metastatic lesions
within the lower cervical and upper thoracic spine.


Brief Hospital Course:
Patient is a 56 year old female with metastatic ovarian cancer
with history of recurrent pericardial effusions causing
tamponade originally admitted [**2151-6-13**] for SOB [**1-28**] tamponade,
treated with pericardiocentisis then pericardial window on
[**2151-6-15**].  Pt then developed severe right side parotiditis with
sepsis and was transferred to the MICU on [**2151-6-26**].
.
Shortly after her admission to the MICU, the patient became
diaphoretic and developed acute respiratory address (RR 30's, O2
sats 80s), and was intubated due to increased work of breathing.
 She subsequently became hypotensive (MAP 50s), with cool,
mottled appearing lower extremities.  A right femoral TLC was
placed and patient was begun on vasopressors
(levophed/vasopressin) and IVF boluses.  The etiology of her
acute decompensation was felt likely to be sepsis caused by
transient bacteremia seeded from the partoiditis.  Pt was status
post a course of nafcillin, and was begun on empiric treatment
with levoquin and unasyn per ENT recommendation.
.
# SEPSIS:
The most likely etiology was felt to be transient bacteremia
from parotiditis.  However, evaluation for other sources of
infection included CXR, cultures of blood, urine, sputum, stool
for c. diff, and parotid gland.  RUQ and abdominal ultrasound
were unremarkable for hydronephrosis, cholecystitis and ascites
(small amount, insufficient to tap).  Evaluation for cardiogenic
sources of shock included enzymes (unremarkable), EKG, and
repeat ECHO.  In addition, the femoral TLC (felt to be dirty)
was replaced with a subclavian TLC, and a right arterial line
was placed.
- continue treatment with unasyn/levoquin (started [**6-26**])
empirically.
- pt received single dose of vancomycin to cover for MRSA.
- continue levophed/vasopressin to maintain MAP > 60.
- cardiac enzymes unremarkable.
- hold home metoprolol.
.
# RESPIRATORY FAILURE:
Felt likely [**1-28**] sepsis induced acidemia in the setting of poor
pulmonary reserve (multiple metastatic pulmonary nodules).  Pt
seen by ENT and felt that parotiditis was not likely to cause
airway compromise.  Pt on 6L home O2 for chronic lung disease
felt likely [**1-28**] metastatic lung disease and treatment.

.
# PAROTITIS:
No stone seen on CT scan.  Pt being followed by ENT.  Most
common organisms are staph aureus, oropharyngeal flora, or GNR.
Parotid gram stain shows GPR.  Plan is to continue treatment
with antiobiotics (unasyn, levo, vancomycin) started on [**6-26**],
warm compresses, massage as tolerated, sialigogues (once no
longer sedated), and agressive hydration.
- concern regarding further swelling of neck resulting in
respiratory obstruction felt unlikely by ENT.  pt also at risk
for osteomyelitis of adjacent facial bone.

# ARF:
Baseline creatine ~1.2 up to 1.9 upon admission, felt most
likely pr
