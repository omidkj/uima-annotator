Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 22990**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
BiPAP

History of Present Illness:
76 y.o. female with severe COPD x 25+ years, supplemental oxygen
for over a year, DMII, vascular dementia, presenting from home
with respiratory distress.
.
Patient was brought in by EMS after family called due to
increased work of breathing. Patient lives in multi family home
with daughter living in next door house. They report that
patient was recently discharged from rehab on [**2178-2-5**] for
similar complaint, and had been home for about 2 weeks.
Approximately 4 days prior to presentataion, family noted she
was having productive cough with greenish / brown streaked
sputum. They deny any fevers, chills or diaphoresis. On the day
prior to presentation, physical therapy evaluated her at home
and found her oxygen saturation in 80's. Since, she has been
receiving increasing frequency of nebulizer treatments.
.
On date of admission, patient reportedly went to the restroom
where she called for help due to "crushing chest pain" and
difficulty breathing. Family immediately called EMS. During my
evaluation, she denied this chest pain prior to presentation.
.
In the ED, vital signs were initially: 122, 134/116, RR32.
Patient noted to have significant respiratory distress, placed
on NRB with O2 sat in 100's, however initial blood gas
7.19/98/90. Patient given nebulizer treatments, solumedrol,
azithromycin, magnesium and started to CPAP @ 40%, PEEP6, ~20 TV
400's. HR 100, BP 103/53 on nitro initially given for severe
hypertension (200' systolic); however off at time of transfer.
Patient admitted to MICU for further management.
.

STUDIES:
.
CHEST X-RAY: ([**2179-2-20**])
PORTABLE UPRIGHT AP VIEW OF THE CHEST: Cardiac silhouette is top
normal in
size. The aorta is tortuous with calcifications present. There
are mild
increased interstitial markings bilaterally, suggestive of mild
interstitial pulmonary edema. Blunting of the costophrenic sulci
bilaterally suggest the presence of small bilateral pleural
effusions. No pneumothorax is visualized. No acute skeletal
abnormalities are visualized.
IMPRESSION: Mild interstitial pulmonary edema with small
bilateral pleural
effusions.
.
CXR ([**2179-2-27**])
FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no
relevant
change. Large lung volumes consistent with COPD. Mild bilateral
apical
thickening. Normal size of the cardiac silhouette, mild
tortuosity of the
thoracic aorta. No focal parenchymal opacities suggesting
pneumonia. Pleural effusions.
.
[**2179-2-22**] CT OF THE CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST:
The heart size is normal. There is no pericardial effusion. Mild
coronary
and aortic calcifications are present. The aorta and main
pulmonary artery
are normal in caliber. Scattered mediastinal and hilar lymph
nodes do not
meet CT criteria for lymphadenopathy.
.
A multinodular goiter is present, with hypoechoic lesions
measuring up to 16 mm. This is unchanged since [**2178-1-26**]. There
is no cervical or axillary lymphadenopathy.
.
The lungs are well aerated to the subsegmental levels. No
pulmonary embolism is seen, although the study is slightly
limited due to respiratory motion-related artifact. There is
diffuse centrilobular emphysema, unchanged since the prior CT
exam from 1/[**2178**]. Within the right upper lobe, there is a 14 x
11 mm enhancing nodule with surrounding ground-glass opacity
(3:21). Previous CT examinations since [**2176**] have shown a
confluent reticular and ground-glass opacity in this area,
compatible with a focal area of scarring. However, the current
study demonstrates a new solid central region, so an underlying
solid mass can no longer be excluded. Within the left upper
lobe, there is a vaguely defined linear region of ground-glass
opacity (3:22), unchanged since prior [**2176**], and compatible with
mild scarring. No other nodules or masses are appreciated. There
is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
.
Included views of the upper abdomen demonstrate multiple
gallstones within a normal-appearing gallbladder. The included
views of the liver and spleen are unremarkable.
.
OSSEUS STRUCTURES: Minimal dextroscoliosis is present. Mild
degenerative
changes are present throughout the thoracic spine. Old left
fifth and sixth rib fractures are unchanged. There is no acute
fracture or dislocation. No sclerotic or lytic lesions are
detected.
.
IMPRESSION:
1. No pulmonary embolism detected.
2. Previously seen right upper lobe density now demonstrates a
central solid component. A solid mass cannot be excluded. PET
examination is recommended for further assessment.
3. Persistent vaguely-defined linear area of ground-glass
opacity within the left upper lobe is unchanged and compatible
with mild scarring.
.

FINDINGS: Waveforms of the common femoral veins are symmetric
bilaterally
with appropriate response to Valsalva maneuvers. In both lower
Extremities, the common femoral, proximal greater saphenous,
