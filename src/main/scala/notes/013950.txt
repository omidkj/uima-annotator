Admission Date:  [**2176-9-15**]       Discharge Date:  [**2176-10-3**]


Service:  Medicine

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 84 year old
white male well known to the Medical Intensive Care Unit with
a past medical history significant for subdural hematoma,
status post evacuation, difficulty to wean, Enterobacter
Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia and
acute cholecystitis, status post a seven day course of
antibiotics and delirium who was discharged from [**Hospital6 1760**] on [**9-9**], to [**Hospital **]
Rehabilitation Facility and returned with a one day history
of decreased mental status and hypotension.  At baseline, the
patient is intermittently agitated and confused.  On [**9-14**] at the Rehabilitation Facility he was noted to be
lethargic and responds only to noxious stimuli.  On arrival
to the Emergency Department, the patient was tachycardiac to
the 120s with saturations in the 80s, respiratory rate in the
30s and blood pressure ranging in the 70 to 80 systolics/40
diastolics with a temperature of 100.8.  The patient was
bolused with 1 liter of normal saline which increased the
blood pressure to 110/60.  The patient was infiltrated with
Ampicillin, gentamicin and Flagyl for presumed abdominal
source of infection.  Since his arrival the patient has had a
negative head computerized tomography scan and abdominal
computerized tomography scan negative for free fluid, free
air or inflammatory processes.  The abdominal computerized
tomography scan was positive for a large left pleural
effusion with collapse and a moderate right pleural effusion.
His right upper quadrant ultrasound was positive for
gallbladder wall thickening, large stone in the gallbladder,
biliary sludge in addition to pericholecystic fluid and
adenomyomatosis, all of which were unchanged from a prior
study done prior to his admission.  The patient was seen by
General Surgery in the Emergency Department and not felt to
have an acute gallbladder or other intra-abdominal pathology.
The patient was initially slated to be admitted to Medicine
but had increased requirements of suctioning in the Emergency
Department by the nursing staff and thus is being admitted to
the Medicine Intensive Care Unit for controlled secretions
and workup of the underlying infection.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Arthritis, glaucoma, subdural hematoma
in [**2176-7-29**], complicated by an extended Intensive Care Unit
stay with Enterobacter, Enterococcal pneumonia treated with
Levofloxacin and Zosyn, cholecystitis treated with Ampicillin
and Flagyl and Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus
sputum treated with Vancomycin for presumed
Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia, status
post tracheostomy placement and percutaneous endoscopic
gastrostomy.  Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and flutter,
hypertension, hernia surgery, increased cholesterol,
transurethral resection of prostate in [**2159**], gout, peptic
ulcer disease, left carpal tunnel release, right knee
replacement and baseline mental status as of [**9-9**] as
agitated but able to communicate intermittently with a
component of delirium.

ASSESSMENT:  This is an 84 year old male status post subdural
hematoma, approximately two months ago, status post
evacuation with his hospital course complicated by difficulty
weaning respirator, Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus
aureus and Enterobacter pneumonia and cholecystitis who was
discharged to a nursing home for about one week when he
developed hypotension, tachycardia and tachypnea at first
thought to be sepsis, later found to have an anterior wall
myocardial infarction with a decreased ejection fraction
admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for management of
his multiple medical problems.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  1.  Cardiovascular - Coronary arteries, the
patient is status post anterior wall myocardial infarction on
admission, currently on Aspirin, Beta blocker, ACE inhibitor
and a statin pump.  The patient initially had a decreased
ejection fraction from a baseline of 55 to 25% after his
acute coronary event.  However, the patient's ejection
fraction was improved as noted on a follow up echocardiogram
which showed an ejection fraction of 40%.  The patient had
transudative bilateral pleural effusions which were taped one
time, however, further thoracentesis was not pursued given
its transudative nature and likelihood of recurring.  The
patient was treated conservatively with Lasix with a goal of
-500 to 100 liter per day to avoid acute intravascular
depletion.

Rhythm, the patient had a history of atrial fibrillation, did
have a few episodes in-house and was cleared for
anticoagulation by Neurosurgery, however, was not continued
on anticoagulation given his increased bloody secretions and
urine once being on Heparin and Coumadin.  The patient also
suffered from sick sinus syndrome while in-house after his
anterior wall myocardial infarction.  Heartrate remained
above 60 on his Lopressor.  The patient was continually
monitored with no further events.

Hypertension, the patient's hypertension was well controlled
on Lopressor, Captopril and Lasix in addition to control of
his agitation.  His hypotension improved dramatically as
compared to the beginning of his stay with the addition of
these agents.

2.  Respiratory failure - Secondary to the patient's
bilateral pleural effusions and weakness.  The patient was
maintained on pressor support ranging between 5 and 10 with a
positive end-expiratory pressure of 5, with adequate title
volume, respiratory rate and oxygen saturations.  We
continued to maintain the patient's pressor support given his
persistent effusions and muscle weakness, however, the
patient did not show any evidence of distress.
