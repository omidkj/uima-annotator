History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 48 year old male with past medical history of DMI,
ESRD on HD, CAD with DESx2 most recent [**5-5**] who presented to the
hospital with about [**12-30**] cup of hemoptysis 3 hours after a recent
discharge for chest pain and shortness of breath believed to be
related to bronchitis. In brief, the patient has a history of 4
years of chronic dry cough. He has undergone an extensive workup
that had not yet revealed a cause. Over the summer he was
started on inhaled steroids with some relief. In [**2140-8-29**]
he started to have mild hemoptysis. His PCP ordered [**Name9 (PRE) 11149**] and a
CT. The PFTs showed a mild restrictive picture and his CT showed
diffuse mild ground glass opacities. He was next bronchoscopied
in the beginning of [**2140-9-28**]. The bronchoscopy was positive
for hemosiderin laden macrophages but otherwise no infectious
agents. It was unclear at that time if these were due to
hemoptysis or a vasculitis. The day after the bronchoscopy he
presented to the ED with chest pain, SOB on [**2140-10-1**]. During that
hospitalization a repeat CT showed worsening of the ground glass
opacities consistent with alveolitis. Ultimately he was believed
to have fluid overload which was treated with HD and pneumonia,
and was discharged on levofloxacin on [**2140-10-5**]. A few hours later
on [**2140-10-6**] he returned to the ED with frank hemoptysis. He was
bronchoscopied for further evaluation of the ground glass
opacities and during the bronch developed submassive hemoptysis.
He was taken emergently to the OR for intubation and a rigid
bronch and had laser coagulation of the overlying area of
bleeding. The likely source of bleeding had been identified
during the earlier flexible bronchoscopy. IP believed it could
be a a Dulefoys ulcer, although these are usually seen in GI
tract. Of note patient had a [**Date Range **] placed 5 months prior and is on
ASA and Plavix. During this and his previous bronchoscopy he was
found to have hemosiderin laden macrophages, again raising the
possibility of some form of pulmonary hemosiderosis versus
chronic bleed from hemoptysis or vasculitis. Multiple serologies
were sent. RF , CRP, ESR, were positive. ANCA, GBM, and [**Doctor First Name **] were
negative.
.
On further history, the pt reported long term chronic diarrhea
which he controls with loperamide. An antiTTG was sent and came
back positive. Based on this constellation of findings,
pulmonary consult raised the [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 95748**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] syndrome
- which is defined essentially as celiac disease and ideopathic
pulmonary hemosiderosis.
.
His MICU course was complicated by difficult to control
hypoglycemia on his home regimen of insulin and ultimately ended
up on an insulin drip as well as persistent hypertension. He
also had the complication of lobar colapse from the hemmorrhage
and bronchoscopies which is resolving. Otherwise, his extubation
was uneventful and he did well. He was transfered to the floor
after being cleared for POs by speech and swallow and an HD
session.
.
On the floor he verified the details of his history and had no
additional complaints. His speech was slowed and he is a
somewhat poor historian. Much of his history was taken from MICU
and pulmonary house staff.

Portable TTE (Complete) Done [**2140-10-8**] at 10:30:44 AM The left
trial volume is markedly increased (>32ml/m2). The left atrium
is dilated. There is moderate symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular
filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size
and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets are
moderately thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral
valve prolapse. Physiologic mitral regurgitation is seen (within
normal limits). The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is
normal. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade. IMPRESSION:
Moderate symmetric LVH with normal regional and global
biventricular function. Diastolic dysfunction with elevated
filling pressures. Moderate thickening of aortic valve leaflets
without stenosis.
