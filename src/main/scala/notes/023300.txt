The lung volumes are normal.  The lung bases on the left and
right
show linear opacities with air bronchograms, most likely
consistent with
atelectasis.  However, a presence of pneumonia cannot be
excluded.

No other lung parenchymal abnormalities.  In the mediastinum
however, there is
increased density, notably in the right paratracheal
compartment, associated
with substantial narrowing of the lower third of the trachea and
distortion of
both the right and left main bronchus.  Right and left main
bronchus are also
narrowed.  To clarify the morphologic situation, notably for
exclusion of a
central malignancy, CT should be performed.

No pulmonary edema.  Normal size of the cardiac silhouette.  No
pleural
effusions.

Sinus rhythm. Left atrial abnormality. Early R wave progression.
Single wide
complex beat, probable ventricular premature beat but consider
atrial premature beat with aberration. No previous tracing
available for comparison.

Brief Hospital Course:
71 yo M with oxygen dependent COPD, obstructive sleep apnea,
diabetes mellitus presenting with shortness of breath found to
have large central mediastinal mass with airway effacement as
per outside hospital radiology report.

Active Issues:
# Squamous cell lung carcinoma:  Patient initially presented to
outside hospital with hypoxia secondary to paratracheal
mediastinal mass, which on pathology was poorly differentiated
squamous cell carcinoma.  Radiation oncology and oncology were
consulted for further management. Patient received XRT while
admitted but due to continued hypoxia and respiratory failure,
poor progress and overall poor prognosis (see below) the family
decision was to focus on comfort, and patient extubated and
expired quietly and peacefully in the presence of family
members.

# Hypoxia: Patient with progressive increase in dyspnea at rest
over past few days increasing his baseline home 02 requirement.
Most likely secondary to necrotic paratracheal mediastinal mass
with airway effacement that was seen on CT from outside
hospital.  Interventional pulmonary team consulted and rigid
bronchoscopy done on [**2111-7-1**], along with biopsy of lung mass.
After procedure he returned to the ICU with diffculty managing
secretions and was intubated.  Patient was extubated the
following morning, however was intubated again due to difficulty
in managing secretions resulting in hypercarbia.  Pathology
returned as poorly differentiated squamous cell lung carcinoma
and patient was transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for radiation of lung mass.
Patient remained intubated for his entire [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] course without
ability to safely extubate.  After multiple discussions with
patient's family, family clearly endorsed patient's clearly
expressed wishes to avoid long-term life support, including
mechanical ventilation, and tracheostomy was not acceptable to
patient. Focus of care was shifted to comfort.  The patient was
extubated, and quietly and peacefully expired in the presence of
family members.

# Cellulitis:  Patient with traumatic skin tear on R lower
extremity on admission, which appeared to be erythematous and
indurated on hospital day 2, a change from admission exam.  He
was started on vancomycin for coverage of cellultis which
continued until patient death.

# ATN: Patient developed increased Creatine with muddy brown
casts in urine consistent with ATN. Medications were renal dosed
and nephrotoxic medications were held.

Chronic Diagnoses
#Diabetes mellitus: Held home meds and placed on sliding scale
insulin.

#HTN: Initially held home meds and blood pressure was managed
with IV and PO meds.

#Hyperlipidemia: continued home simvastatin 40mg daily

Transitional Issues
Pt expired.
