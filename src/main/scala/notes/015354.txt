female recently discharged three days prior to admission from
[**Hospital6 **] after a seven day admission with the
MICU stay for right lower lobe pneumonia and sepsis.
Antibiotics course was finished about two days prior to
admission. The day of admission was found to have change in
mental status, hypoxia, hypotension at her nursing home and
was transferred to [**Hospital1 69**]
Emergency Department for further management.

weakness.
2.  Hypertension.
3.  Cataracts.

stays.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  No alcohol or smoking history.  Resident at
[**Hospital3 537**].

ALLERGIES:  Aspirin.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1.  Plavix 75 mg po q.d.
2.  Neurontin 300 mg po b.i.d.
3.  Multivitamin.
4.  Lactulose prn.
5.  Lisinopril 20 mg po q.d.
6.  Colace 100 mg po b.i.d.
7.  Senna.
8.  Dulcolax.
9.  Percocet prn.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Vital signs temperature
103.  Blood pressure 104/33.  Heart rate 80.  O2 sat 92% on
nonrebreather. In general, somnolent, uncomfortable and
minimally responsive.  HEENT oropharynx is dry.  Neck is
supple.  No jugulovenous distention.  Cardiovascular
examination tachycardic.  Normal S1 and S2.  2 out of 6
systolic ejection murmur.  Lungs bibasilar crackles.  Abdomen
diffusely tender.  No guarding.  Question rebound.  No bowel
sounds.  Slightly distended.  Neurological examination
minimally responsive, difficult to complete due to lack of
cooperation.  Extremities warm, dry and no evidence of edema,
rashes, cyanosis or clubbing.

LABORATORIES ON ADMISSION:  White blood cell count 23.4 with
90% neutrophils, 0% bands, 7% lymphocytes, hematocrit 38.9,
platelets 240, sodium 143, potassium 6.1, which is hemolyzed
and repeated at 4.3, chloride 106, bicarbonate 25, BUN 57,
creatinine 2.2, glucose 118, INR 1.2, PTT 28.4.  Urinalysis
showed moderate leukocyte esterase, 6 to 10 white blood
cells, 3 to 5 red blood cells, moderate bacteria, yeast few,
6 to 10 squamous epithelial cells.  Blood cultures times two
were sent. Urine culture was sent.  Electrocardiogram was
normal sinus rhythm of 80, normal axis and intervals.  No ST
or T wave changes.  Chest x-ray showed left hemidiaphragm
obscured likely infiltrate in right lower lobe.  No evidence
of congestive heart failure.  KUB showed somewhat distended
large bowel with stool throughout colon.

IMPRESSION:  The patient is a [**Age over 90 **] year-old female with septic
shock likely secondary to recurrent pneumonia versus
infectious colitis.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was given fluid in the
Emergency Department, however, her systolic blood pressure
did not improve above the 70s.  She was started on a Dopamine
drip, which brought her blood pressure up to a systolic of
104.  She was also started on antibiotics with Ceftazidime,
Levaquin, Vancomycin and Flagyl.  Abdominal CT was performed,
which showed evidence of sigmoid colitis starting from the
splenic flexure down toward the rectum with bowel wall
thickening.  The differential diagnosis included ischemic
colitis versus infectious colitis, however, given the
clinical history it seems more likely to be infectious
colitis.  After being brought to the floor a central line was
placed in the right internal jugular vein without
complications.  Pressors were changed from Dopamine to
vasopressin at a dose of .04 units per minute continuous
infusion.  Dopamine was weaned down to a rate of 3 mcg per
kilogram per minute with the patient's systolic blood
pressures around 100 with maps around 50.  The patient was
also given a Cortrosyn skin test the results of which showed
an increase of Cortisol from 30.7 to 41.2 showing an
appropriate bump and empiric steroids were discontinued.
Antibiotics were continued with Levaquin, Flagyl and
Vancomycin by levels and her mental status did actually
improve somewhat over the course of the next day.

Acute renal failure:  The patient was noted to have a
creatinine of 2.2 on admission with oliguria.  She was given
some hydration and with pressors and her urine output began
to pick up somewhat and her creatinine went from 2.2 to 1.6,
however, she is likely still prerenal.  Fluid resuscitation
was difficult given increasing pleural effusions bilaterally
suggesting congestive heart failure as a result of volume
resuscitation.  For now the preferred method of resuscitation
will be with pressors as opposed to fluid resuscitation.

Infectious disease:  As above the patient is being treated
with broad spectrum antibiotics.  Cultures were sent for a
C-diff, stool cultures, urine cultures and blood cultures the
results of which are pending at the time of this dictation.

Diabetes mellitus:  The patient was placed on a regular
insulin sliding scale, however, as she is NPO has not
required any insulin to be given.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Sepsis.
2.  Infectious colitis.
3.  Right lower lobe pneumonia unclear of completed
treatment.
4.  Diabetes mellitus.
5.  Hypertension.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Serious, but guarded.  The patient
is to be discharged to [**Hospital6 **] as the majority
of her care over the past several months has been at [**Hospital6 11241**] including the majority of her medical records.
Plan of care was discussed with the medical team that will be
accepting her there.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
1.  Vasopressin 0.04 units per minute intravenous drip
continuous infusion.
2.  Heparin 5000 units subcutaneous q 8 hours.
3.  Vancomycin 1 gram intravenous based on levels.
4.  metronidazole 500 mg intravenous q 8 hours.
5.  Levofloxacin 250 mg intravenous q 24 hours.
6.  Dopamine infusion 5 to 10 micrograms per kilogram per
minute.
7.  Regular insulin sliding scale.
