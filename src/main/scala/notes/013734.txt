Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2181**]
Chief Complaint:
Hypotension, hypoxia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Thoracentesis [**2150-6-3**]
CT Guided Retroperitoneal Biopsy [**2150-6-12**]


History of Present Illness:
75M with h/o ESRD on HD, chronic trach/vent [**1-17**] PNA [**12-23**], T2DM,
recent PEG removal, presenting from NH after being found with
decreased responsiveness and found to have hypotension and
hypoxia at NH. Baseline BP is 90-100 systolic. Physician called
to bedside 3:30am for periodic leg muscle twitching, due to his
h/o seizures. He was noted to be A&Ox3 and asymptomatic, with T
99.1F, satting 94% on 40% TM, RR 18, BP 98/60, FS 193. Over the
next 2-3 hours, he became intermittently restless and lethargic
but per EMS records, patient became less responsive, with repeat
BP of 60/40, which improved to 80/40 with a 250mL bolus. HR was
116-120 in AF with RVR, RR 22, SaO2 94-7% on 100% TM. Patient
does have known stage 2-4 sacral decubs, and known fistulous
track from removal of PEG recently removed due to leak. NH staff
have been attempting to give him pills PO with purees, no
reports of aspiration per family.
.
In the ED, initial VS were T 99.4F, BP: 69/26, HR: 115, RR: 26,
SaO2: 91% on 40% TM. He was given 2L NS, whereupon IVF were
stopped due to a CXR consistent with volume overload. Reportedly
due for HD today. BP improved to 90/40, and levophed was started
through a preexisting midline catheter, raising BP to 128/68 at
Levophed at 0.05. He was found to have a leukocytosis to 30.1
with 92% PMN, lactate 1.6. Chem 7 and LFTs near baseline. As
mentioned, CXR demonstrated moderate pulmonary edema with
bilateral effusions, can't exclude underlying PNA. An abd/pelvis
CT was done to r/o abdominal wall abscess due to recent leaking
PEG. The CT showed no fluid collections, cholelithiasis with
mild GB wall edema, and likely retroperitoneal adenopathy. A RUQ
U/S was done which again showed cholelithiasis with no evidence
of cholecystitis. Cultures were drawn from midline, and he was
started on vanc/Levofloxacin, and Flagyl.
.
MICU course: Hypotension and hypoxia found to be due to Serratia
sepsis. The source of the sepsis was felt to be his HD catheter,
aspiration PNA, sacral decubs/ LE ulcers or infection along the
fistulous track from recent PEG. Patient initially resusitated
on IVFs, but given development of pulmonary edema he was changes
to pressor support with levophed. He was weaned off pressors
after being given albumin.  He was weaned off the ventilator and
onto his trach collar after drainage of a right pleural
effusion. He remains on vancomycin and ciprofloxacin (initially
had been on vanc, meropenem and tobramycin). He was transferred
to the floor for further management.

Pertinent Results:
IMAGING:
abdominal CT scan
CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST: Within the visualized lung
bases, there are moderate-sized bilateral pleural effusions,
with associated atelectasis of the adjacent lung. The heart is
enlarged, without evidence of a pericardial effusion.

The liver, spleen, and adrenal glands are unremarkable. There
are several
gallstones present within the gallbladder, with mild distention
of the
gallbladder. There is no evidence of gallbladder wall thickening
or
pericholecystic fluid. Pancreas is atrophic, without a focal
lesion. Both
kidneys are also mildly atrophic, with multiple rounded
hypodense lesions
within the left kidney too small to characterize. Extensive
atherosclerotic calcifications of the abdominal aorta and the
major branches are seen.

There is a defect within the anterior abdominal wall, with a
fistulous
connection with the anterior portion of the stomach, which is
compatible with given history of recent gastrostomy tube that
was subsequently removed. Stomach and small bowel are normal.
There are several scattered diverticula throughout the colon,
without evidence of diverticulitis. There is no free air or free
fluid. Abnormal retroperitoneal soft tissue is seen,
particularly in a para-aortic location, likely reflects
retroperitoneal adenopathy. The craniocaudad dimension of this
lesion is approx. 10 cm.
CT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST: Urinary bladder is normal.
There are
prostatic calcifications. Apparent mild wall thickening of the
rectum likely is related to underdistension. There is no pelvic
free fluid or adenopathy.

OSSEOUS STRUCTURES: Multilevel degenerative changes are present
throughout
the thoracolumbar spine, with loss of disc height, endplate
sclerosis, and
marginal osteophytes. No suspicious lesions are identified.

STUDY: AP chest, [**2150-6-27**].
HISTORY: Patient with thick secretions and possible mucus plug.
FINDINGS: Comparison is made to previous study from [**2150-6-11**].
The tracheostomy, right-sided central venous catheter are
unchanged in
position. There is again seen a large left retrocardiac opacity
and bilateral pleural effusions, which are stable.

FOOT 2 VIEWS RIGHT  ([**2150-7-6**])
INDICATION: Evaluate for osteomyelitis or extension of right
heel ulcer past eschar.
IMPRESSION:
Soft tissue swelling and right heel ulcer without definite
evidence of
underlying osteomyelitis. Small enthesophyte at the insertion of
the Achilles tendon on the calcaneus. Increased sensitivity for
detection of osteomyelitis could be achieved with MR.

FLOW CYTOMETRY REPORT

FLOW CYTOMETRY IMMUNOPHENOTYPING

The following tests (antibodies) were performed: HLA-DR, FMC-7,
Kappa, Lambda, and CD antigens 2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 19, 20, 23, 45.



RESULTS:
Three color gating is performed (light scatter vs. CD45) to
optimize lymphocyte yield.  B cells are scant in number (less
than 5% of total analyzed events) precluding evaluation of
clonality.  T cells comprise approximately 83% of lymphoid gated
events and express mature lineage antigens (CD 2, 3, 5, 7).

INTERPRETATION

Non-specific T cell dominant lymphoid profile; Clonality could
not be assessed in this case due to paucity of B cells in this
sample.  Unequivocal diagnostic immunophenotypic features of
involvement by non-Hodgkin B-cell lymphoma are not seen in
specimen.  Correlation with clinical findings and morphology
(see S08-[**Numeric Identifier 77794**]) is recommended.  In addition, cytospin reveals
that the specimen is hemodiluted.
