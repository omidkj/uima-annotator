Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 618**]

Headache

Cerebral angiogram


History of Present Illness:
62RHM with a PMH of right parietal IPH in [**2119**] no microbleeds to
suggest amyloid on recent MRI [**8-/2124**] and felt to be related to
hypertension, 1x GTC seizure in [**2120**] on lamotrigine, lung cancer
s/p right lobectomy 3 years ago with chemotherapy with radiation
and radiation pneumonitis and periodic bronchospasm now
seemingly
in remission, Paroxysmal AF not on anticoagulation, CRF, HTN,
COPD presented with a 2 day history of right temporal headache
followed by acute onset on ED evaluation [**2125-4-29**] of left
hemiparesis and difficulty speaking at 7pm with head CT at
[**Hospital 27217**] Hospital showing a roughly 3.2x2.9cm right temporal IPH
with minimal edema and mass effect and is being admitted to the
neuro-ICU.

Patient notes being previously assessed at [**Hospital 27217**] Hospital [**4-15**]
weesk ago where he apparently had a 4 day hospitalisation for
headaches where CT head was normal and discharged. He was then
at
his baseline until 2 days ago when he noted a relatively sudden
onset of right temporal headache which was sharp and at times
severe.He hadno nausea, vomiting and no visual changes. Thsi
worsened ovver this time but the patient was stoical. He was
visiting [**Hospital 27217**] Hospital for an unrelated reason where his
wife
felt he did not look himself. She then took him to the ED to
evaluate his headaches where at just after 6pm he had a CT which
showed a right temporal IPH as above. Importantly, per his wife,
apparently AFTER this at roughly 7pm he then had onset of left
weakness and speech difficulties where initilly he could not
move
the right side at all. Unfortunately we do not have notes of his
current admission from [**Hospital 27217**] Hospital but perreport given to
ED, he was loaded with fosphenytoin and given IV ondansetron and
fentanyl and transferred to BIDMV for further evaluation.

Since transfer his symptoms have improved. He is now antigravity
in both left arm and leg although the arm is weaker than the
leg.
He also described some numbness and tingling in his left hand
and
this seemingly subsided. He also felt light-headed and noted
cough, SOB and some chest tightness with wheezing while in
[**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 27217**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] (has COPD).

He still has a fairly significant headache and was given
morphine
for this in the ED. He is somewhat inattentive and has a right
gaze preference but is verbalising well and shows insight into
his situation.
