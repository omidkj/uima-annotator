History of Present Illness:
Mr [**Known lastname 91697**] is a 69yoM with h/o t2DM, hyperlipidemia, HTN, who
presented to PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**2165-6-18**] with complaint of generalized
fatigue x1 month with sore throat and conjunctivitis, as well as
chest pain and dyspnea when exerting. Labs found glucose 718,

Pathology:
[**6-20**]: Bone marrow immunophenotyping - PB: Immunophenotypic
findings consistent with involvement by acute myelogenous
leukemia with monocytic differentiation.
[**6-20**]: Bone marrow pathology: not finalized
[**6-21**]: Bone marrow cytogenetics: pending

Microbiology:
[**6-20**]: Blood culture pending
[**6-20**]: Urine culture negative
[**6-21**]: Blood culture pending
[**6-22**]: Blood culture pending
[**6-23**]: MRSA screen pending

Imaging:
TTE [**6-20**]: The left atrium is moderately dilated. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction
with distal septal, anterior and apical akinesis (distal LAD
territory). The remaining segments contract normally (LVEF =
40-45%). No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild to moderate
([**11-25**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

CXR [**6-20**]:  Heart size is normal. Widening of the azygos contour
and convexity within the aorticopulmonary window are present, as
well as apparent thickening of the posterior wall of the
bronchus intermedius on the lateral view and symmetrical
narrowing of the lower trachea on the frontal view. Lungs are
clear except for minimal linear atelectasis versus scar at the
bases. Apparent bronchial wall thickening is noted in the lower
lungs on the lateral view, and note is also made of small
pleural effusions on this projection. Skeletal structures
demonstrate mild scoliosis and degenerative changes in the
spine, as well as healed right rib fractures.

CXR [**6-21**] s/p port placement: Interval placement of a right PICC
line with the tip in the distal superior vena cava. Cardiac and
mediastinal contours are essentially unchanged although hilar
contours are slightly prominent and have previously raised the
possibility of lymphadenopathy. Correlation with more remote
chest films would be advised. In the absence of a stability or
clinical explanation for this finding, consideration should be
given to further evaluation with CT.  Patchy opacity at the left
lung base may reflect an area of patchy atelectasis, although an
early pneumonia cannot be excluded. Clinical correlation
advised. No pleural effusions or pneumothoraces.

ECHO [**2165-7-15**]:
The left atrium is dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is mild
regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with distal
septal, anterior and apical akinesis. There is no ventricular
septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The diameters of aorta at the sinus,
ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and
no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild to moderate ([**11-25**]+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve lea
