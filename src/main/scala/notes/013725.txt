History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 47F with history of DM2 on lantus and metformin
who p/w one day history of nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain,
fevers, and hyperventilation.  Patient was in her usual state of
health until yesterday, when she developed significant nausea
and non-bloody, non-bilious emesis.  Felt her symptoms may be
secondary to food poisoning, though denies any new/unusual foods
and has not had any sick contacts.  Initially went to [**Hospital 7302**], but eloped from the ED before a full
work-up was complete.  Per [**Hospital3 5097**] ED attending Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **],
patient had FSBS in 400s prior to arrival, was started on IVF,
had PIV placed, and labs were drawn.  Patient became upset about
the time it was taking to be seen, and she left before her labs
had come back.  Per report, CBC notable for leukocytosis with
left shift, but lab did not process chem7.  Patient states she
went home but became febrile to 102, with increasing shortness
of breath.  Was urged by her father to seek further medical
attention, and presented to [**Hospital1 18**] ED for evaluation of
hyperventilation.
.
In the ED, initial VS were 96.9 116 134/88 40 100%.  Labs
notable for critically high FSBS, with blood glucose level 542,
K 7.3, Na 130 (corrected 138), bicarb <5, and WBC 29.5 with
92.1% neutrophils.  UA showed mod blood, glucose 1000, ketones
150, protein 30, but was not suggestive of UTI.  CXR did not
suggest PNA.  ECG not concerning for ischemia.  Patient had
blood cultures drawn, and was started on empiric antibiotics
with vanc/zosyn.  She received sodium bicarb, 4L NS, and was
started on insulin gtt at 8 units/hr that has since been
increased to 10 units/hr.  Repeat electrolytes showed glucose
603, K 6.9, bicarb <5.  Vitals prior to transfer 104 41 118/57
100% RA.
.
On arrival to the MICU, patient still tachypneic to 30s, though
states that overall she feels better and feels her breathing has
improved.  N/V and abdominal pain have resolved.  Denies CP or
cough.
.
Of note, patient reports she had a recent episode of
hypoglycemia in which she fell and fractured her left arm.  Her
lantus dose was then decreased from 60 units daily to 30 units
daily (15 units [**Hospital1 **]) about one week ago, and her metformin dose
was decreased from 1000mg [**Hospital1 **] to 500mg [**Hospital1 **].  Patient states she
has been compliant with these medications.  Also of note, she
had a prior admission to [**Hospital1 18**] in [**2154**] at which time she
presented with general malaise, polyuria, polydipsia, and blood
glucose 540.  Was diagnosed with new onset DM and DKA, and
discharged on metformin and glyburide.

Brief Hospital Course:
47yo female with DM2 who presents now with DKA in the setting of
recently decreased lantus and metformin doses.
.
# DKA: Pt has type 1 DM [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) **] consulting service, not DM2.
She meet criteria for DKA given serum glucose >250 mg/dl,
acidemia, serum bicarbonate <18 mEq/l, and moderate ketonuria.
Trigger for DKA may be medication related, as patient reports
that while she has been compliant with her diabetes medications,
her insulin regimen and metformin doses were recently halfed.
Some concern as well for an infectious trigger, given patient's
history of fever and leukocytosis, though leukocytosis may be
elevated in setting of acute stress.  N/V and abdominal pain
prior to admission may have been secondary to viral
gastroenteritis or other acute abdominal process, though may
also have been secondary to underlying DKA.  No symptoms or
lab/imaging evidence to suggest UTI, PNA, hepatitis,
cholecytitis, or myocardial ischemia as etiology of DKA.
Patient with anion gap of ~24 on admission, with repeat labs
demonstrating increase in gap to ~30.  She also developed a
non-gap acidosis, possibly secondary to ongoing sodium chloride
administration in ED.  VBG was concerning for profound acidemia,
with pH of only 6.96.  Patient's tachypnea was likely related to
respiratory compensation for profound acidemia.
.
The patient was started on intravenous insulin drip, with serial
monitoring of her blood glucose level and her electrolytes.
Throughout the day the patient's anion gap closed, eventually
becoming none. Once the patient's blood sugar was less than 200,
the patient was switched to D5 half-normal saline with
potassium. In consultation with the [**Hospital6 30927**], the
patient remained on insulin drip, with the D5 half-normal
saline, to insure resolution of the ketosis. The patient's a
eletrolytes were were repeated intermittently, and by nighttime
of her admission the patient was able to tolerate food.
.
For workup of the inciting incident of DKA, repeat physical exam
was performed after her anion gap closed. On reevaluation, the
patient had no fever, no cough, no runny nose, no abdominal
pain, no dysuria, notable for frequency. No vaginal discharge,
no pain in the joints. The patient denied any recent chest pain
or shortness of breath. Laboratory workup for source of
infection were generally not conclusive. The patie
