[**2135-7-2**] CXR
CHEST AP: The aorta is tortuous. There is elevation of the right
hemidiaphragm. There is bibasilar atelectasis. Kerley B lines
are present representing mild failure. Extensive degenerative
changes are seen in the right shoulder joint. A calcified
density is present in the upper right neck. This could represent
a calcified thryroid nodule, a lymph node or degenerative
changes.

[**2135-7-2**] EKG
Sinus rhythm. Left atrial abnormality. Left anterior fascicular
block.
Anterolateral myocardial infarction, age indeterminate. No
previous tracing
available for comparison.

[**2135-7-4**] Cardiac Cath
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Two vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Mild mitral regurgitation.
3. Severe systolic and diastolic ventricular dysfunction.
4. Moderate to severe pulmonary hypertension.
5. PCI of the LAD.

[**2135-7-5**] ECHO
Conclusions:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. No atrial septal defect
is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity is
moderately dilated. Overall left ventricular systolic function
is severely depressed (ejection fraction 20-30 percent)
secondary to akinesis of the interventricular septum, anterior
free wall, lateral wall, and apex (there is some sparing of the
basal segments); the inferior and posteroir walls contract. No
masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. There is no
ventricular septal defect. The right ventricular cavity is
dilated. Right ventricular systolic function appears depressed.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Moderate
(2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The mitral regurgitation jet
is eccentric.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired
relaxation. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There
is borderline pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.



Brief Hospital Course:
1) CAD - Pt presented in CHF and found to have old anterior MI
on EKG, thought to be about 2 weeks old by history.  The patient
went to cardiac cath where she was found to have 2 VD (LAD, PDA)
and 2 DES placed in LAD.
- con't aspirin, plavix, toprol xl, lisinopril
- Troponin T peaked at 1.81

2) CHF - Patient likely had anterior infarct 2 wks prior to
admission, causing worsening LV function in the subsequent 2
weeks.  She presented with SOB from CHF, and she was diuresed
while here.
- EF now 20-30%
- con't anticoagulation with coumadin (goal INR [**2-10**]), will
bridge with lovenox
- con't lisinopril, toprol xl, lasix

3) HTN - BP well controlled on Toprol 25 mg PO QD, Lisinopril 5
mg PO QD.  Will con't these medications.

4) FEN - low sodium diet, lasix 20 mg po qd to maintain
euvolemia.

5) PPX - protonix, anticoagulation

6) Deconditioning - patient was very weak 2 wks prior to
admission and had deconditioning while in hospital.  Physical
therapy came to evaluate the patient and felt that she warranted
PT in a rehabilitation facility in efforts to restore pt's
physical competencies and activities to baseline.

7) Code - Full code (discussed with patient)
