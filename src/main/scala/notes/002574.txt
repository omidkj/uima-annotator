Service:  CCU

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 82-year-old
man with past medical history of coronary artery disease,
status post stent to the left circumflex artery as well as
history of chronic left bundle branch block.  The patient was
admitted to [**Hospital1 69**] on [**4-1**] with complaint of [**3-16**] weeks of epigastric pain.  The
patient describes the pain as [**7-20**] and nonradiating.  The
patient states that the pain was not associated with
shortness of breath, nausea, vomiting, lightheadedness, or
palpitations.

The patient reports that on [**3-31**], he awoke from a nap
with severe pain.  This prompted him to seek treatment in the
Emergency Department.

The patient also reports increasing dyspnea on exertion.
Several years ago the patient noted dyspnea on exertion with
a two block walk.  ETT MIBI in [**2194**] disclosed no
electrocardiogram changes or perfusion defects.  Over the
past few months the patient has become short of breath over
only a half a block walk.  He experiences dyspnea on exertion
occasionally accompanied by a nonradiating epigastric pain,
though the pain is only 1.5/10.

Patient was admitted to Medicine Service on [**3-31**] for
evaluation of his epigastric pain.  Initial CKs were within
normal limits.  He was continued on the proton-pump inhibitor
and the GI service was consulted.  He underwent MRI/MRA for
workup for possible mesenteric ischemia.  This study was
negative.  It did disclose intra and extrahepatic ductal
dilatation.

On 06:30 pm on [**4-1**], the patient noted onset of
epigastric pain.  The am troponins from that day was elevated
at 6.7.  The patient was given aspirin, beta blocker, and was
started on Heparin.  He eventually became pain free.  The
patient was sent to the SICU for closer observation.  At
catheterization the patient was found to have three vessel
coronary artery disease, left anterior descending artery had
95% calcified stenosis before D1.  There is an 80% focal
stenosis after D1.  The left circumflex had 40% stenosis of
OM-2, 40% of the ramus was occluded.  Right coronary artery
was heavily calcified with 50% stenosis in the mid vessel and
90% stenosis in the branching PL.

Furthermore, during the catheterization patient had episode
of asystole requiring temporary pacing.  Nevertheless, the
patient underwent successful stenting of the left anterior
descending artery and diagonal.  He was admitted to the CCU
for further management.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Esophagitis/GERD.
2. Coronary artery disease, last catheterization in [**2191-3-11**] disclosed two vessel disease.  The patient had PTCA and
stent to the left circumflex lesion with 20% residual
stenosis.  The calculated ejection fraction was 60%.  There
were no wall motion abnormalities.  There was mild mitral
regurgitation.  Chronic left bundle branch block.
3. Transient ischemic attack.
4. Chronic renal insufficiency.

OUTPATIENT MEDICATIONS:
1. Ditropan 5 mg po q day.
2. Nexium 40 mg [**Hospital1 **].
3. Vicodin 1-2 tablets prn.
4. Vioxx 25 mg po q day.
5. Reglan 5-10 mg po q day.
6. Dyazide 37.5/25 q day.
7. Atenolol 25 mg po q day.
8. Plavix 75 mg po q day.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives at home and spends [**Doctor Last Name 6165**]
in [**State 108**], former smoker.  Drinks 2-3 alcoholic beverages
per week.  No IV drug use.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Pleasant elderly male in no apparent
distress.  Blood pressure 160/86, heart rate 80s, respiratory
rate 21, and O2 saturation is 96% on room air.  HEENT:
Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light.  Extraocular
movements are intact.  Mucous membranes moist.  Oropharynx is
clear.  Neck is supple, jugular venous distention 2 cm below
mandible.  Heart:  Regular, rate, and rhythm, distant heart
sounds.  Lungs are clear to auscultation anteriorly.  Abdomen
is obese, nontender, positive bowel sounds.  Extremities:
Trace lower extremity edema, right knee scar, right femoral
line in place.  Neurologic is alert and oriented times three.
Cranial nerves II through XII are grossly intact.
Examination is otherwise nonfocal.

LABORATORY DATA:  White count was 5.1, hematocrit 34.3,
platelets 128.  Chemistries are a significant for a BUN and
creatinine of 126 and 1.7.  Magnesium 2.6.

IMAGING:  MRI/MRA of the abdomen disclosed celiac and SMA
widely patent, severe intrahepatic and extrahepatic bile duct
dilatation, no common bile duct stone, or ampullary mass
identified.

ELECTROCARDIOGRAM:  Sinus bradycardia at 48 beats per minute,
prolonged P-R interval, left bundle branch block, no
significant ST segment elevation.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient is admitted to CCU for further
management.

1. Cardiovascular:  A. Ischemia:  Following patient's
catheterization results noted above, the patient was
continued on aspirin and Plavix during the remainder of his
hospital stay.  He was administered beta blocker, ACE
inhibitor, and a statin as well.  Patient will likely undergo
intervention to the right coronary artery in approximately
two weeks.

B. Pump:  Echocardiogram was checked during the patient's
admission.  Patient had an ejection fraction of 55%, regional
left ventricular wall motion is normal, trivial MR is seen,
moderate 2+ TR is seen.  Pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension is noted.

C. Rhythm:  The patient is noted to have bradycardia during
catheterization.  The patient developed asystole in
catheterization laboratory and required stent placement, a
temporary pacer wire.  EP consult was obtained.  EP service
recommended starting a low dose beta blocker, and monitoring
the heart rate for his signs and symptoms of chronotropic
insufficiency.  Etiology of bradycardia/asystole event
thought to be related to catheter used during cardiac
catheterization.  Furthermore, the patient has no history of
syncope/presyncope.

2. GI:  MRI/MRA results noted above.  The patient will
require ERCP for further evaluation.

3. Heme:  Patient required transfusion 2 units of blood
during his hospital stay.

4. Nutrition:  Patient maintained on a clear liquid diet
initially.  His diet was advanced as he tolerated.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Good.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  Home.

FOLLOW-UP INSTRUCTIONS:  The patient will follow up with his
primary care physician, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**First Name (STitle) **] Flyer.  The patient will
also followup with his cardiologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 120**].  The
patient will follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] from Gastroenterology
in four weeks.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. NonST elevation myocardial infarction.
3. Severe left ventricular diastolic dysfunction.
4. Pulmonary hypertension.
