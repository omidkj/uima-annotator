Brief Hospital Course:
# Weakness, lightheadedness: Likely due to deconditioning and
low PO intake during long hospitalization. Guaiac negative in
ED. We walked with him in the [**Doctor Last Name **] and he was very stable on his
feet. Hct stable (33.9 -> 33.0). Felt much better after eating
breakfast and lunch.
.
# Diarrhea: Started having greenish watery diarrhea overnight
after admission. Low suspicion for C. diff as no antibiotics
were administered during recent hospitalization. His whole
clinical picture may be due to viral gastroenteritis causing
general malaise and abdominal discomfort. Diarrhea ceased in the
morning. We sent stool cultures, C. diff toxin and gave him 500
cc IVF since he had had low PO intake for the past 15 days. He
also started taking in good POs.
.
# Left-sided chest and abdominal pain: Not typical of his
anginal pain, possibly just gas pain from viral gastroenteritis.
Cardiac enzymes negative x 2.
.
# CAD s/p CABG and DES: ASA, clopidogrel, atorvastatin,
metoprolol were continued.
.
# HTN: Home BP meds continued with hold parameters.
.
# HLD: Continued home atorvastatin, omega-3 FAs.
.
# FEN: Cardiac diet, IVF as above
# PPX: Heparin SC
