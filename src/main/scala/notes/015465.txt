History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 13170**] is a 65 yo male w/ metastatic melanoma on CTLA-4
antibody protocol who presented to [**Hospital3 3583**] on [**1-15**] with
complaint of weakness and diminishing PO intake x 3 days, per
wife. According to his wife, he was ambulatory the day PTA and
then was noted to be lethargic and confused on the morning of
admission. She reports that he had not been eating or drinking
for 3 days, and she had found food she had prepared for him in
the trash. Of note, patient was seen in the Brain [**Hospital 341**] Clinic
on [**1-10**] and reported
upper respiratory tract symptoms, including a frontal headache,
nasal congestion, and erythema around his eyes. He was treated
with azithromycin for sinusitis.
.
On arrival to the [**Hospital3 3583**] ED on [**1-15**], he was felt to be
dehydrated and was admitted for rehydration. A temperature of
101.1 was documented at time of admission. He received IVF
following admission to the Medicine service. He subsequently
developed urinary retention and was started on levofloxacin for
UTI and ?sinusitis. A Neurology Consultation was obtained and CT
and LP were performed which showed protein 75, glucose 58, WBC
13 (12N,78L,10M). GRAM STAIN: occ Polys, no organisms.
Culture(-). AFB(-). It was concluded that his altered mental
status was related to "metabolic encephalopathy" in the setting
of UTI vs. sinusitis. He was treated with levofloxacin. PO
intake remained poor and mental status continued to deteriorate.
His wife states that he was ambulating until Monday, and has
been lying in the fetal position for the past two days. Given
his persistent and declining mental status, he was transferred
to the OMED service for further evaluation and management.
.
Upon arrival to OMED, labs were notable for cortisol of <0.3 and
sodium of 122. Team was concerned for leptomeningeal spread vs.
CNS infection. He was started on acyclovir empirically for
possible viral meningitis and plan was for repeat MRI and LP (to
obtain opening pressure and cytology).


Past Medical History:
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Metastatic melanoma with known mets to brain and lungs
- He was diagnosed with melanoma in [**2171**] when a right anterior
neck lesion was discovered. He then underwent excision and
biopsy at this time and underwent 8 months of alpha-interferon
treatment. He then developed right chest wall pain and a CT of
the torso revealed metastatic disease to the lungs and the
patient subsequently underwent 26 rounds of IL-2 therapy ending
on [**2173-5-11**]. A head MRI in [**6-3**] did not reveal any intracranial
masses. However, on [**2173-10-24**] he developed a headache with
continuous occipital and neck pain that progressed to an
intermittent bilateral frontal head pain with cough only and
associated sensitivity to light. On [**2173-11-2**], he was taken to an
OSH for evaluation and found to have an intracranial lesion on
head CT. He was then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for a craniotomy on by
 [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name8 (MD) **], M.D., Ph.D., which was performed on [**2173-11-4**].
This was followed by whole brain cranial irradiation to 3600 cGy
 in 12 fractions.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 13170**] is a 65 year old gentleman with metastatic melanoma
on CTLA-4 protocol transferred from OSH for altered mental
status.

1. Altered mental status: CSF analysis at OSH demonstrated
protein of 75 with [**Hospital1 18**] LP with CSF of 65 concerning for HSV
encephalitis.  Patient was started on IV acylcovir empirically.
Leptomeningeal spread of malignancy was also considered, with
CSF cytology non-diagnostic and MRI without significant
findings.  HSV PCR on the CSF as well as all other culture data
was negative (though other viral PCR/cultures were not done).
He received 7 days of IV acyclovir. We decided not to re-LP to
perform further studies as the risks outweighed the benefits,
his mental status had cleared, and it would unlikely change the
treatment plan.  The patient was also found to be hyponatremic
to 121 during his admission, which was may have contributed to
his altered mental status and he had adrenal insufficiency which
could have contributed as well.  EEG was done which did not show
evidence of seizure, but did show possible subcortical
dysfunction within the right temporal lobe.

2. Hyponatremia: Patient came in with sodium of 121 and the
differential diagnosis included SIADH and adrenal insufficiency.
 Random cortisol was low (0.3) and urine sodium was high.  We
treated him with fluid restriction of 1L day and his sodium cam
up to 130, then we changed this t
