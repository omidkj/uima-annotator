History of Present Illness:
HPI: 85yoM with h/o CAD, CHF, Afib, CKD, s/p pacer, transferred
to [**Hospital1 18**] from OSH for evaluatin of [**Hospital 56102**] transferred to MICU with
hypoxemia after witnessed aspiration event.
.
Patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] [**2117-7-3**] for evaluation of SDH.
He had initially presented to OSH with c/o 4-5 weeks of
lethargy, fatigue, and generalized weakness associated with
shortness of breath and weight gain. He had been diagnosed with
CHF and worsening renal function within the prior months. At
that time he also reported a fall five days prior to
presentation. Initial INR at OSH 3.4. He was evaluated in the ED
by the Neurology service who felt the SDH may be related to
underlying lesion, and not necessarily due to the fall. He was
loaded with Dilantin, and the following day a trigger was called
for decreased mental status. He returned to his baseline,
oriented to person, place, and at times year that day.
.
Today at 10:00AM patient had witnessed aspiration event while
drinking juice. At 15:15PM, floor resident called for patient
complaining of abdominal pain. Vitals at the time of evaluation
HR 70, BP 150/60, RR 28, unable to obtain O2saturation. ABG
performed 7.41/37/53. Patient placed on NRB with repeat ABG
7.40/38/184. Lactate noted to be 3.8. CXR revealed developing
RML opacity consistent with aspiration event.
.
Pt started on levo and flagyl and improved over 2 days in terms
of resp status. continued Cr in 3 range with low fena. Rpt head
CT for SDH stable on [**7-6**].

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 85yoM with h/o CAD, CHF, Afib, CKD, s/p pacer, admit with
[**Hospital 56102**] transferred to MICU with hypoxemia after witnessed
aspiration event:
.
# Hypoxemia: Likely due to aspiration pneumonitis vs evolving
aspiration pneumonia. Patient also has history of CHF, but did
not appear grossly volume overloaded or in decompensated CHF.
- Levofloxacin and metronidazole given to cover aspiration
pneumonia (day [**5-23**] on d/c)
- checked ECG (no change) and ruled out for ACS
- supplemental O2 to maintain saturation >91% given
- CXR shows improvement of aspiration event
.
# Mental status change: patient has had fluctuating mental
status since admission, likely delirium. DDx includes worsening
SDH (although stable per neurology report), phenytoin toxicity,
infection, uremic state. NOW AT BASELINE (on D/C).
- rpt Head CT stable SDH - will need repeat again in [**2-20**] weeks
(discussed with PCP's office).
.
# SDH: stable per recent head CT. No changes in neuro
exam/mental status. Per neurosurgery, no IV heparin, no coumadin
x 1 week from event, SC heparin and baby ASA OK, will need
repeat head CT with contrast once renal function allows in [**3-20**]
weeks as above
- although OK to restart coumadin by [**7-11**], will hold as pt high
risk for repeat fall and bleed on coumadin -> defer to PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **]
not restart in-house (discussed with PCP's office)
- restarted baby ASA at D/C
.
# ? Meningioma on Head CT - needs repeat head CT in [**3-20**] weeks
for further evaluation and characterization in [**3-20**] weeks as
above - this communicated to PCP's office.
.
# CV:
Ischemia: No acute ischemic episode
- ruled out MI with three sets of enzymes
- no ECG changes
- on rosuvastatin, metoprolol, baby ASA. [**Name2 (NI) **] ACE-I given renal
function
Pump: EF normal; no acute decompensation
- kept intake and output even
- hydral for afterload reduction

Rhythm/A fib: paced, rate-controlled on BB. Digoxin on hold
given elevated level and CKD -> will hold on digoxin for now
given risk for toxicity with poor renal function
.
# CKD: Creat clearance 15-20 mL/min, likely due to
diabetic-hypertensive nephropathy, but etiology not known. No
gross proteinuria. Spoke with RN of PCP (PCP on vacation) - per
records, Cr steadily rising since [**12-21**] (1.8---->2.5 on
[**2117-5-26**]). Pt had been referred to nephrologist, HD had been
discussed, and patient was going to see surgery for eval of AV
fistula. 24-hour urine in office significant for CrCl 15 ml/min.
Cr has been 2.8-3.1 and stable in hospital. This is most likely
[**2-18**] progression of CKD. Continued renally dosing all meds. No
acute indication for HD seen during admission
.
# HTN: stable, continue current meds.
.
# Type II diabetes mellitus: on glyburide at home - held on
admission
- insulin sliding scale used in hospital with QID FSG and on D/C

.
# Health Care Maintenance: Pneumovacc given in hospital.
