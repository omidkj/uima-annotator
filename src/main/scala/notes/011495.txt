HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 73-year-old woman who
was admitted to the hospital on [**2118-1-26**] for
congestive heart failure.  She had a recent hospitalization
at [**Hospital1 69**] prior to this visit
in [**Month (only) 359**] with congestive heart failure, paroxysmal atrial
fibrillation, and acute-on-chronic renal failure.  She was
discharged home on [**2117-12-1**] with plans for
rehabilitation and recovery at home and then possible mitral
valve repair in the future for her known mitral
regurgitation.

The patient reported two admissions to outside hospitals
since her discharge on [**12-1**] and weakness as well as
gastrointestinal bleed.  One admission on [**12-14**] showed
an INR of 10.65.  A colonoscopy was also done at that time.
Gastrointestinal bleed thought induced by an elevated INR.

On [**1-25**] she presented again to an outside hospital
with bright red blood per rectum and progressive weakness.
INR on admission to the outside hospital was 5.62.  Her INR
was reversed.  She is now transferred to [**Hospital1 346**] for further evaluation and treatment
as well as workup for possible aortic valve
replacement/mitral valve replacement with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **].  She denied any angina, palpitations, diaphoresis,
nausea, or vomiting.  She reported edema, fatigue, weakness,
and dyspnea on exertion.  The patient had no catheterization
of record on here; but appears to have had her last
catheterization in [**2117-3-29**] at an outside hospital with
clean coronaries.

On [**2118-1-18**] a transesophageal echocardiogram had
been done at [**Hospital1 69**] which
showed an ejection fraction of 30 to 35 percent, moderate
global left ventricular hypokinesis, trace aortic
insufficiency, 3 plus mitral regurgitation, 2 plus tricuspid
regurgitation, and no noted AF at the time.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Atrial fibrillation.
2. Hypertension.
3. Congestive heart failure.
4. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
5. Chronic renal insufficiency (with a baseline creatinine of
   2).
6. Osteoarthritis.
7. Gout.
8. Mitral regurgitation.
9. AF.
10.      Tricuspid regurgitation.
11.      Diverticulitis.
12.      History of gastrointestinal bleed.
13.      Hernia.


PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:
1. Hysterectomy.
2. Cholecystectomy.
3. Appendectomy.
4. Tonsillectomy.


ALLERGIES:  She has multiple drug allergies including SULFA,
ASPIRIN, CODEINE, ALLOPURINOL, COLCHICINE, and DIGOXIN.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  When she was seen by Cardiac
Surgery on [**2118-1-27**] included Coreg 3.125 mg p.o.
twice daily, amiodarone 200 mg p.o. once daily, Coumadin 2.5
mg p.o. once daily, Lasix 60 mg p.o. twice daily, Protonix 40
mg p.o. once daily, Advair 100/50 twice daily, and Caltrate
500 mg p.o. twice daily.

SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  In preparation for impending
valve surgery the patient underwent a number of studies and
also was seen daily by the Medicine Service and the
Cardiology Service for resolution of her congestive heart
failure.  Preoperative carotid ultrasounds also showed a
probable occluded left vertebral artery, but less than 40
percent bilaterally in her common carotid artery.

Sh[**Last Name (STitle) **]in the hospital approximately 10 days prior to her
surgery with plans to obtain either repeat pulmonary function
tests from an outside hospital or new pulmonary function
tests at [**Hospital1 69**].  Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) 411**] determined the patient needed a new cardiac
catheterization as the prior one was almost 10 months old.

A GI consultation was discussed, although there was bleeding
in the setting of an elevated INR.  Cardiothoracic Surgery
also recommended a possible Neurology consultation as the
patient reported presyncope and syncopal symptoms over the
past two months.  The patient could not clearly say if the
episodes were with atrial fibrillation or a gastrointestinal
bleed or if they were independent.  She also reported visual
changes and the sudden onset of blurred vision that lasted
minutes at a time.

She had a CT scan at an outside hospital in [**Month (only) **], for
which the Cardiothoracic Surgery team was trying to obtain
the films for neurologic review.  Colonoscopy from the
outside hospital from [**12-17**] showed diffuse moderate-to-
severe diverticulosis of the sigmoid and descending colon and
a colon polyp.  A small-bowel series on [**2117-12-20**]
also at an outside hospital showed a distended third portion
of the duodenum with recommendations for abdominal CT.  The
patient was also instructed to her family bring in her prior
pulmonary function tests but that they would not have to be
repeated if they were within six months.

The patient did have a Foley catheter in place.  She was
treated for a urinary tract infection from [**2118-1-22**]
to [**2118-2-2**] with Levaquin.  The Foley was removed on
[**2118-2-6**].  She also received two doses of Macrodantin
for a urinary tract infection.

Heparin was stopped overnight on midnight on the night prior
to surgery.  A preoperative chest x-ray was unremarkable.
Her pulmonary function tests showed a FEV1 of 0.76 (which is
47 percent of predicted).  Preoperative laboratories were as
follows.  Sodium was 141, potassium was 4.1, chloride was
102, bicarbonate was 29, blood urea nitrogen was 35,
creatinine was 2.6, with a blood sugar of 85.  White blood
cell count was 4.6, the hematocrit was 34, and the platelet
count was 195,000.  Her last PT on the heparin drip was 150.
This was discontinued at 12 midnight.  A Dental consultation
was not done.

On [**2118-2-7**] the patient underwent aortic valve
replacement, mitral valve replacement, tricuspid valve
repair, replacement of ascending aorta, closure of ASD/ISD,
and a partial maze radiofrequency ablation.  The patient
received a 23-mm CE pericardial aortic valve, a 27-mm mitral
ThermaFix pericardial valve, a 32-mm partial tricuspid ring,
a 26-mm gel weave tube graft in the ascending aortic
position.

The patient was transferred to the Cardiothoracic Intensive
Care Unit on a milrinone drip at 0.25 mcg/kg/min, a
nitroglycerin drip at 0.7 mcg/kg/min, and an epinephrine drip
at 0.02 mcg/kg/min.

Over the course of the next several days, the patient
exhibited both bradycardia and a rapid atrial fibrillation.
She remained on an epinephrine drip and a Neo-Synephrine drip
for several days for pressor support.  Electrophysiology
consulted on the patient and determined that she had tachy-
brady syndrome and would require a pacemaker.  She was also
seen by Physical Therapy for initial evaluation and Case
Management for future discharge planning.

On [**2-16**], she continued to make good progress.  She was
weaned off her drips and was transferred out to the [**Hospital Ward Name 121**] Two.
Over the course of the next couple of days, she did complain
of some pain in her right foot which was similar to her gout
pain.

On [**2-18**], she received a pacemaker by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **]
[**Initial (NamePattern1) **]. [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 284**] of the Electrophysiology Service.  She was
started on Toprol and amiodarone.  Again, she refused to
restart Coumadin given her increased bleeding risk and prior
gastrointestinal bleeds.  This was elected not to be given to
the patient.  Also on [**2-18**], a chest x-ray showed small
bilateral effusions, but the patient made excellent progress
on the floor after her pacemaker and was discharged from the
hospital.

A repeat cardiac catheterization showed a normal left main,
normal LAD, a normal ramus, a 30 percent OM1 lesion of the
circumflex, and a normal RCA, as well as severe aortic
stenosis.

On the day of discharge, the patient's examination was as
follows.  The blood pressure was 124/56, a paced right-handed
at 70, the temperature was 97, and the respiratory rate was
20.  Her weight was 70.8 kilograms on this - her 15th
postoperative day.  She was saturating on 96 percent on room
air.

Her laboratories prior to discharge were as follows.  White
count was 6.4, th
