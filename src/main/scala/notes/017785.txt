History of Present Illness:
This 56 year old female with history of interstitial pulmonary
fibrosis on 2L home O2 chronically presents with cough and chest
pain.  She stated that the cough and chest pain began one week
prior.  She also reported some nasal congestion and fevers.  Her
cough was productive of green sputum and was accompanied by
right sided sub sternal chest pain.  The pain is intermittent in
nature, sharp, it doesn't radiate.  She reported no sick
contacts, no hemoptysis.  No abdominal pain, no N/V/D.  Her
daughter said that she was sick last weekend, felt a little
better over the weekend, sounded a lot better the day prior to
admission.  She presented to [**Company 191**] where she was seen by Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 1538**] and was found to have decreased O2 sats, she was sent
to the ED for evaluation.
  At baseline she is on home O2 2L, 3-4 liters at night.  In the
ED she was found to have decreased BS at the bases with wheezes.
 Her CXR showed rt pleural effusion, ? of pneumonia.  She was
treated with combivent, solumedrol, Ceftazadime, and Zithromax.
She was reassessed and found to be somnolent, tachypneic with
very little air movement.  The decission was made to intubate
her based upon these symptoms and she was intubated.  A chest CT
was performed and she was transferred to the MICU.

Additional pertinent labs/studies:
.
[**2110-10-8**] CXR: Interval increase in amount of air in the bullae
in the right hemithorax. CT recommended.

[**2110-10-8**] CT Chest: 1. Severe bronchiectasis and volume loss in
the right lung which is probably of minimal or no function.
Moderate-to-severe left lower lobe bronchiectasis slightly
improved when compared to [**9-2**] without new focal
consolidation.

2. Interval increase in right lung base bulla when compared to
the prior
study.

3. Chronic fibrotic changes with calcifications in the left
upper lobe,
likely related to prior granulomatous disease.

4. Severe, chronic pulmonary hypertension.

5. There are no pleural effusions.

6. Enlarged pulmonary arteries, likely due to pulmonary artery
hypertension.

7. In the axial images, the ET tube appears to be at the level
of the carina. Withdrawal of 1 cm should be prudent.

8. Small tracheal diverticulum.

[**2110-10-13**] ECHO: The left atrium is elongated. Left ventricular
wall thickness, cavity size, and systolic function are normal
(LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall
motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic arch is
mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic
regurgitation. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with
trivial mitral regurgitation. There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There
is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Preserved global biventricular systolic function.
Compared with the prior report (tape unavailable for review) of
[**2105-4-10**], the findings are similar.

[**2110-10-13**] CXR: 1. Worsening multifocal opacities within the left
lung, most likely due to worsening multifocal pneumonia
superimposed upon chronic bronchiectasis.

2. Stable appearance of chronic bronchiectasis and volume loss
in the right lung as well as a large right lung bulla.

[**2110-10-19**] CXR: The previously identified edema in the left lung
has been increased. There is continued fibronodular opacity in
the left upper lobe as described.

[**2110-10-23**] CXR: 1) Status post tracheostomy tube placement with
interval removal of NG tube, and interval placement of a PICC.
The distal tip of the PICC is difficult to ascertain, but may
terminate in the right atrium.

2) Apparent lucency below the right hemidiaphram worrisome for
free air. This was discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 26969**] at the time of
interpretation of the study. (Note that this was not present in
the initial preliminary report).

[**2110-10-26**] CXR: Tracheostomy tube and right PICC line remain in
place, with the PICC line terminating in the expected location
of the right atrium. There is volume loss in the right
hemithorax with collapse of majority of the right lung with
associated bronchiectasis. A large bulla is noted in the right
lower lung zone. Within the left lung, there are diffuse
bronchiectatic changes, with interval increase in
peribronchiolar opacities, particularly within the left lower
lobe. Finally, note is made of free intraperitoneal air within
the abdomen, which has decreased in severity in the interval.
.
IMPRESSION:
1. Decrease in amount of free intraperitoneal air.
2. Slight worsening of peribronchiolar opacities, especially in
the left lower lobe. This may represent progressive infection in
this patient with underlying bronchiectasis.

Brief Hospital Course:
56 year old female with history of pulmonary fibrosis probably
from TB presenting with respiratory distress, with worsening CXR
and lung CT, intubated for respiratory support with difficulty
weaning off the vent now s/p course of levofloxacin for
Pseudomonal PNA sensitive to FQ and s/p trach.

1. Respiratory distress - On admission we considered that Mrs.
[**Known lastname 16905**] could have worsening brochiectasis vs. pneumonia with
underlying lung disease. She has relatively [**Name2 (NI) 26970**] respiratory
function at baseline due to her history of TB, pulmonary
fibrosis, and having only one functional lung. She is on 2L O2
by NC at home at baseline, with 3-4L at night, and a recent
diagnosis of OSA requring nightime BIPAP. She al
