RADIOLOGY  Final Report

MR RECONSTRUCTION IMAGING  [**2112-10-2**] 3:17 PM

MRCP (MR ABD W&W/OC); MR CONTRAST GADOLIN

Reason: eval for etiology of pancreatitis
Contrast: MAGNEVIST

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
63 year old woman with resolving DKA, pancreatitis of unknown
etiology
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
eval for etiology of pancreatitis
MRI FO THE ABDOMEN WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRAST (MRCP PROTOCOL),
DATED [**2112-10-2**]

CLINICAL HISTORY: 63-year-old woman with resolving BKA,
pancreatitis of unknown etiology.

TECHNIQUE: In- and out-of-phase T1, HASTE, 2D time-of-flight,
and pre- and post-gadolinium dynamic sequences were performed at
1.5 Tesla using a non- breath-hold technique. Images were
reformatted on a separate workstation.

COMPARISON: Comparison is made to prior abdominal MRI dated
[**2111-2-22**].

FINDINGS: Study is somewhat limited due to non-breath-hold
technique.

The intra- and extrahepatic biliary ducts are normal in
diameter, without evidence for filling defect. Normal pancreatic
duct anatomy is identified and there is no duct dilatation. The
pancreas is normal in signal without evidence of a focal mass.

Both the liver and spleen are decreased in signal on long TE
sequences suggesting iron deposition. No focal liver lesions are
identified. The patient is status post cholecystectomy.

The spleen is normal in size. Adrenal glands are normal. There
are several bilateral simple cysts, measuring up to 2.8 cm in
diameter. Note is made of a 1.4 cm hemorrhagic cyst in the left
kidney. The visualized bowel is normal.

IMPRESSION:
