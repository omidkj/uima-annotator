shortness of [**First Name3 (LF) 1440**]

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
83F with history of COPD on home O2, sCHF (EF 25%), squamous
cell lung cancer and anemia, presented with one week worsening
dyspnea on exertion with acute worsening this afternoon.
Discharged from [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2162-8-6**] after treatment for acute on
chronic diastolic heart failure exacerbation.  She received IV
lasix with improvement of her symptoms.  During that admission,
she had an echo that showed EF 25% (previously 40-45% in
3/[**2162**]).  Additionally, due to hypoxia had work-up for DVT and
PE which were negative.  CT showed interval worsening of her
known squamous cell carcinoma with associated left sided
effusion.  She was discharged [**Last Name (un) **] on no diuretics due to concern
of impaired renal function.  Sent home with home O2 and hospital
bed with plan for outpatient discussion of care for carcinoma.
Additionally, has not been taking BP meds as prescribed.  This
afternoon, woke up with acute shortness of [**Last Name (LF) 1440**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] called

tightness.  + cough, dry, non-productive.  no syncope or
palpitations.  No fever/chills, no N/V/D/constipation/dysuria.

   ANAEROBIC CULTURE (Preliminary):    NO GROWTH.

   FUNGAL CULTURE (Preliminary):
Imaging:
CXR [**8-11**]: Severe emphysematous changes are
redemonstrated. Again noted is a moderate-sized left pleural
effusion, which may be slightly larger when compared to the
prior study. Worsening bibasilar air space opacities are noted
which is concerning for infection or aspiration. Mild pulmonary
vascular engorgement is also noted. There is no pneumothorax.
Small right pleural effusion is increased when compared to the
prior study.  Extensive degenerative changes of the left
glenohumeral joint are noted.  There is no pneumothorax. Cardiac
silhouette size is difficult to assess given the presence of
bibasilar air space opacities and bilateral pleural effusions.
Tortuosity of the thoracic aorta with atherosclerotic
calcifications is again noted.

IMPRESSION:
1. Worsening bibasilar air space opacities which is concerning
for infection or aspiration.
2. Moderate-sized left and small right pleural effusions.
3. Mild pulmonary vascular congestion.
4. Severe emphysema.

CXR ([**8-13**]):
A pigtail catheter is seen near the left lung base with the tip
towards the left cardiophrenic angle. There is no evidence of
pneumothorax. Bilateral lungs are hyperinflated consistent with
extensive emphysema changes. Left pleural effusion has
significantly reduced and there is residual minimal pleural
effusion with atelectasis of the underlying lung.
Mild-to-moderate right pleural effusion is unchanged basal
atelectasis. Mild interstitial thickening is seen in the left
mid and bilateral lung bases suggestive of mild pulmonary edema.
There is mild cardiomegaly.


Brief Hospital Course:
83F with COPD oh home O2, severe systolic and diastolic CHF
(EF=25%), squamous cell lung CA was admitted with  dyspnea x 1
week that worsened acutely on the day of admission.  She was
admitted to the ICU from the ED. Her hospital course was
significant for the following issues:
.
# Dyspnea - Patient's dyspnea was thought to be multifactorial
but was consistent with flash pulmonary edema/acute on chronic
systolic and diastolic heart failure. The patient was initially
started on broad-spectrum antibiotics for possibility of
pneumonia, but she remained afebrile and exhibited no signs of
infection, so antibiotics were discontinued. Serial cardiac
enzymes were negative for acute MI. Of note, no maintenance
diuretic had been prescribed when she was discharged home on her
last admission. Aggressive diuresis was pursued in the ICU. She
was maintained on beta-blocker and [**Last Name (un) **].
  Despite diuresis, she continued to have a large right pleural
effusion of unclear etiology. Interventional pulmonary performed
a thoracentesis and pigtail catheter placement and drained
approximately 1 L of fluid, most suggestive of transudate BUT
pleural fluid CYTOLOGY is still PENDING. Afte
