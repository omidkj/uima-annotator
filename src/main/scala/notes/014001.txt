Chief Complaint:
Respiratory Failure

Removal of Y-stent in bronchus


History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 46**] is a 79 year od female with chronic respiratory
failure, h/o GBS in [**2101**], vented, s/p trach x 1 year. Frequent
hospitalization for trach exchanges and stent placements.
Admitted initially to thoracix surgery service with respiratory
failure. Last month, the patient was admitted for worsening
respiratory distress and gastrointestinal bleeding
(diverticulosis and hemrrhoids). During that admission,
bronchoscopy was performed, she was found to have severe
tracheobronchomalacia for which she underwent a Y silicone stent
placement. In addition, she had some component of tracheal
stenosis, and her trach was changed to a Portex #7, which was
telescoped through the Y-stent. She was also diagnosed with
pneumonia based on peak WBC 23, right perihilar and left
retrocardiac infiltrates and positive sputum cultures. Cultures
grew acinetobacter and stenotrophomonas for which she received a
14 day course of Bactrim and Unasyn. She recovered and was
transfered to rehab.
.
She presented to pulmonary clinic on [**9-11**] for routine follow up
appointment, and was found to be in respiratory distress,
tachypneic, hypoxic to 80%. Was placed on mechanical
ventilation, CXR was unchanged from earlier when daignosed with
PNA. Was bronched with 50% lumenal stenosis at stent site with
overgrowth of granulation tissue. BAL grew acinetobacter
sensitive to unasyn. She was started back on bactrim/unasyn She
was planned for OR removal of stent in setting of stenosis but
this was deferred due to pt's persistently high Fi02
requirement. CTA was performed which showed no PE but multifocal
PNA, unclear if this is resolving infection from recent PNA or
new process. S/p repeat bronch with BAL yesterday which showed
the tracheostomy in place/y-stent in place, scant mucous in
airways, no evidence of clear obstruction, moderate distal
granulation tissue. Pt transfered to MICU team for further work
up and management of her hypoxia.
.
Upon transfer to MICU, patient was found to be hypertensive to
200/100 with decreasing 02 sats to mid to high 80s, she was
visibly agitated with audible wheezing. Pt given regularly
scheduled hydral and prn ativan.  [**Name8 (MD) **] rn notes patient
frequently becomes anxious and hypertensive, responds to ativan.
+ anasarca, elevated BNP, pt appeared total body volume
overloaded with elevated BNP. Treated for likely flash pulmonary
edema with nitro gtt, lasix IV gtt.

Pertinent Results:
[**2103-10-3**].  Chest X-ray.
FINDINGS: In comparison with study of [**10-2**], the right upper lobe
pneumonia is slightly more prominent, possibly due to the
relative [**Name (NI) 76419**] of the image. The poorly defined left
retrocardiac density is again seen, most likely representing
atelectasis. Various tubes remain in place.
.
[**2103-9-16**].
IMPRESSION:
1. Dilated proximal small bowel loops, with transition point in
the mid
ileum, after which small bowel loops are nearly completely
decompressed. The findings are concerning for early small-bowel
obstruction, though the presence of some contrast material
within the colon also raises the possibility of a partial
obstruction. Please correlate with history of prior oral
contrast administration.
2. Grossly unchanged appearance of dense bilateral basal
consolidations
within both lungs, only partially imaged.
3. Mild ascites. Diffuse anasarca.
.
[**2103-9-12**].
Echo.
Suboptimal image quality.
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with normal cavity size. Due to suboptimal technical
quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully
excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic function is good
(>45%). Tissue Doppler suggests an increased LVEDP (>18mmHg).
The right ventricular cavity is moderately dilated with free
wall hypokinesis. The apical function is relatively preserved
([**Name (NI) 13367**] sign)The aortic valve leaflets appear structurally
normal with good leaflet excursion. No aortic regurgitation is
seen. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is moderate
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a small
inferior and inferolateral pericardial effusion without evidence
of hemodynamic compromise.
.
[**2103-9-11**]. CTA.
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism or thoracic aortic
dissection.
2. Patchy areas of ground-glass opacity in the upper lobes as
well as more
confluent areas of opacity in all the lobes containing air
bronchograms,
consistent with multi-lobar pneumonia.
3. Subcutaneous edema, small amount of ascites and perisplenic
fluid.

Brief Hospital Course:
In summary, Ms. [**Known lastname 46**] is a 79 female with HTN, CHF, CAD, COPD,
PAF, DM, Hyperlipidemia admitted to the MICU for hypoxic
respiratory failure secondary to vent associated pneumonia.
.
Respiratory failure.  On presentation, the patients respiratory
distress was thought to be due to proximal airway obstruction
with overgrowth of lumenal granulation tissue within the
patient's y- stent. The original plan was to take the patient to
the OR for stent removal.  However, this was delayed due to
persistent hypoxemia on high levels of Fi02.  Her hypoxemia was
evaluated with a CTA on [**2103-9-11**], which revealed no pulmonary
emboli, but did show multi-focal pneumonia.  Her sputum grew
Acinetobacter, Stenotrophomonas, and Pseudomonas on BAL.  Her
antibiotics were broadened to Zosyn as patient was no improving.
 She completed a 14 day course of Zosyn, but due to rising WBC,
