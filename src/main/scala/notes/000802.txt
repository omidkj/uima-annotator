History of Present Illness:
This is a 63 year-old gentleman with hypercholesterolemia
admitted to the [**Hospital3 13313**] on [**2126-11-16**] after he
developed dyspnea on exertion on [**2126-11-12**].  He also noted having
a cough that was exacerbated by lying flat and productive of
pinkish phlegm.  He noted no chest pain, palpitations or
diaphoresis.  No dizziness, or loss of consciousness.  He did
not note any swelling of his extremities.  In addition, he did
report that had had a mild fever and nausea over the past few
days.  Also of note, the patient had a minor dental procedure on
the 18th; he had been started on amoxicillin on [**11-14**] by his
PCP.
[**Name10 (NameIs) **] presentation to the OSH, the patient was afebrile,
tachycardic (P 110-120) with a BP of 108/70 R of 20 and O2 sat.
of 93 on RA.  He was given a one time dose of lopressor, 5 mg
with bought his rate to the 100's.  Pt had rales on lung exam.
Chest x-ray revealed RUL infiltrate and pulmonary edema. EKG
revealed some ST depressions in V4 to V6, troponin I level 0.19
(0.5 or higher is consistent with MI) BNP found to be 538. WBC
mildly elevated Echo was performed revealing prolapse of the
posterior leaflet of the mitral valve with 4+ MR.  Systolic
function reportedly normal.

Pt was started empirically on ceftriaxone and azithromycin for
presumed community acquired pneumonia.  Also given one time dose
of Lasix for CHF exacerbation.  Pt also received 1x dose of 90
mg subcutaneous lovenox at 1700 today.

No recent sick contacts.  [**Name (NI) **] had been nauseous but not vomiting
or diarrhea.  No changes in urine or bowel movements.  He has
not had any prolonged travel recently.

[**2126-11-18**] CT Chest
1. No pulmonary embolus.
2. There are diffuse ground-glass opacities within both lungs,
with associated left atrial enlargement and bilateral pleural
effusions, findings consistent with congestive heart failure.
3. There is a focal confluent opacity within the right upper
lobe, and to a lesser degree in the left upper lobe. This is
associated with multiple mediastinal lymph nodes. These findings
are consistent with an infectious process or pneumonia
superimposed upon underlying CHF.

[**2126-11-18**] ECHO
The left atrium is dilated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
and cavity size are normal. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size
and free wall motion are normal. The aortic root is moderately
dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally
normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is partial
mitral leaflet flail. Moderate to severe (3+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The mitral regurgitation jet is
[**Month/Day/Year 34486**]. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
No vegetation seen (cannot exclude).

[**2126-11-18**] Cardiac Catheterization
1. Selective coronary arteriography revealed a right dominant
system
with severe three vessel CAD. The LMCA had 60-70% stenoses both
at its
ostium and distally.  The LAD had a 70% ostial stenosis and had
60%
distal stenosis. The remainder of the vessel had mild diffuse
disease
with apparently good touch-down targets.  The LCX had a 60%
proximal
stenosis. The OM branches had mild luminal irregularities. The
RCA was
diffusely disease proximally and 100% occluded in its mid
section.  The
distal vessel filled via left to right collaterals.
2. Hemodynamics revealed markedly elevated wedge pressures with
significantly depressed cardiac output/index.  There was mild
pulmonary
hypertension.
3. Left ventricuolography was not performed.
4. Because of the patient's low blood pressure and low cardiac
index,
the decision was made to place a 40cc IABP via the right femoral
artery.
The patient was transferred to the CCU.

[**2126-11-26**] CXR
1. Cardiomegaly without acute pulmonary edema.
2. Bibasilar patchy opacities most likely represent atelectasis.

3. Bilateral small to moderate pleural effusions

[**2126-11-26**] EKG
Sinus rhythm with first degree A-V delay and a brief pause which
is probably second degree AV block (Wenckebach).
Modest nonspecific ST-T wave changes. Since previous tracing of
[**2126-11-23**], A-V dissociation with junctional rhythm now absent.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2126-11-16**] for further
management. A CT scan was obtained which ruled out a pulmonary
embolism. As he had 4+ mitral valve regurgitation by echo at an
outside hospital, the cardiac surgical service was consulted for
evaluation. Blood cultures were obtained to assess for
endocarditis which were negative. A repeat echo revealed a
normal ejection fraction, 3+ mitral regurgitation with a partial
flail leaflet. A cardiac catheterization was performed which
revealed severe mitral valve regurgitation, a 70% stenosed left
main, a 70% stenosed left anterior descending artery, a 60%
stenosed circumflex artery and a chronically occluded right
coronary artery. A intra-aortic ballon was placed for a low
cardiac index and coronary perfusion. Heparin was started for
brief runs of atrial fibrillation. He was taken to the cardiac
care unit for further management. Mr. [**Known lastname **] was worked-up in  the
usual preoperative manner including a carotid duplex ultrasound
which revealed no significant internal carotid artery stenosis.
On [**2126-11-20**], Mr. [**Known lastname **] was taken to the operating room where he
underwent coronary artery bypass grafting to two vessels and a
mitral valve replacement with a 26mm St. [**Male First Name (un) 923**] mechanical valve.
Postoperatively he was taken to the cardiac surgical intensive
care unit for monitoring. On posto
