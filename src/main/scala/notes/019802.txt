Brief Hospital Course:
42 y/o female who is admitted a day prior to surgery for
conversion to heparin drip, is on lovenox at home.
She was taken to the OR with Dr [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]. PLease see the
operative note for full detail. In summary; There was no
evidence of a pelvic recurrence. The lesion in the
retroperitoneum seen on CT scan was sent for frozen section and
did not demonstrate evidence of malignancy. No lesions found
between the spleen and kidney. Multiple other nodules were found
throughout the abdomen, including 1 on the colon
which was taken down and completely excised. There was a small
serosal tear which was sutured. Colonic implants came back as
consistent with metastatic ovarian CA. There were no
diaphragmatic lesions and intra-op U/S did not show any evidence
of lesions within the liver. She was extubated and transferred
to the PACU in stable condition.
In the post op period she did have some pain issues. She was
using a dilaudid PCA which was uptitrated for better relief, she
also received a single Toradol dose.
On POD 4 she developed a fever to 101.4 (febrile neutropenia).
Vanco and Cefepime were started at this time and she received
one dose of Filgrastim. One blood culture came back as positive
for Staph Coag Negative. After 5 days of Vanco and 3 days of
Cefepime IV she was started on a 10 day course of Cefpodoxime
per ID recommendaions.
Blood cultures remain pending from the 13th and 14th. All other
blood cultures and the urine culture were negative.
She was restarted on Lovenox on POD 2, which will be continued
as an outpatient
She had no further issues with fever, however on POD7 she
complained of difficulty breathing and bilateral flank pain. The
chest xray indicated persistent atelectasis and elevated right
hemidiaphragm. No acute changes on EKG. The pain eventually
resolvedwithout further intervention.
JP drain removed on POD 2, ostomy started with output on POD 3.
She was tolerating diet and ambulating.
She will be following up with her oncologist later this week to
evaluate plan of care.
