Intraop echo [**2144-4-21**]
The left atrium is normal in size. No spontaneous echo contrast
or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium/left atrial
appendage or the body of the right atrium/right atrial
appendage. A small patent foramen ovale is present. A
left-to-right shunt across the interatrial septum is seen at
rest. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and
regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There
are simple atheroma in the ascending aorta. There are simple
atheroma in the aortic arch. There are simple atheroma in the
descending thoracic aorta. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic
stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal.
Post
The LV function is preserved
Mild Mitral regurgitation similar to preop
Aorta is intact

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)[**2144-4-28**] 9:54 AM Clip # [**Clip Number (Radiology) 44997**]
[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 84 year old man with severe
restrictive pulm dz, asbestosis
Final Report
An internal jugular central venous catheter on the right is
unchanged in position. Large left pleural effusion with
compressive atelectasis is stable. Small amount of right basilar
atelectasis is also unchanged. Multifocal pleural plaques
related to asbestos exposure are redemonstrated. Aerated
portions of the lungs appear clear without
pulmonary vascular congestion or focal consolidation. Trace left
chest wall subcutaneous emphysema is slightly improved since one
day prior.
IMPRESSION: No significant interval change since one day prior.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the hospital and brought to the
operating room on [**2144-4-21**] where the patient underwent minimally
invasive, endoscopic, off pump coronary artery bypass x1
(LIMA->LAD).  Overall the patient tolerated the procedure well
and post-operatively was transferred to the CVICU in stable
condition for recovery and invasive monitoring.  He was found to
have excessive chest tube output post-operatively and was
brought back to the operating room and re-explored for bleeding.
 Hemostasis was achieved and the patient returned to the CVICU.
Cefazolin was used for surgical antibiotic prophylaxis. POD 1
found the patient extubated, alert and oriented and breathing
comfortably.  The patient was neurologically intact and
hemodynamically stable on no inotropic or vasopressor support.
Beta blocker was initiated and the patient was gently diuresed
toward the preoperative weight.  Chest tubes and pacing wires
were discontinued without complication. The patient did develop
a left sided pleural effusion, and chest tube was placed at the
bedside in the ICU.  The patient was transferred to the
telemetry floor for further recovery.  The patient was evaluated
by the physical therapy service for assistance with strength and
mobility. We were unable to completely wean his oxygen as he
would desaturate with activity, likely a result of his chronic
obstructive disease. By the time of discharge on POD 8 the
patient was ambulating freely, the wound was healing and pain
was controlled with oral analgesics.  The patient was discharged
to [**Location (un) 511**] [**Hospital 21079**] Rehabilitation in good condition with
appropriate follow up instructions.
