Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2901**]
Chief Complaint:
respiratory distress

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
cardiac catheterization (no intervention)


History of Present Illness:
65M h/o poorly controlled HTN, DM2 (last HgbA1c 12.0%),
hyperlipidemia (last LDL 218), obesity with no known CAD
presents with acute SOB.  Saw PCP [**2173-11-3**] complaining of
non-productive cough. CXR revealed vascular congestion. Insulin
regimen changed and c/o fatigue since this time. On the day of
admission, he had unusually poor appetite. At church, he
developed acute-onset SOB with diaphoresis. No CP or nausea.
Found to be in severe respiratory distress by EMS with RR 40 and
intubated in the field. HR 130's (regular) and SBP 292/110 mmHg.
He was given 0.8mg nitro spray and lasix IV 100mg with good
response. FSBS 436.
.
In the ED, received aspirin 325mg, insulin 10 units IV, ativan
IV 4mg, and started on nitro gtt. ECG revealed STE in V3
unchanged from prior and new TWIs in V3-V6. Cardiac enzymes
negative x 1. Transferred to CCU for further management
.
Per family, patient has been taking meds but does not check FSBG
as he dislikes needles. No chest pain, leg swelling, orthopnea
(1 pillow), worsening DOE (climbs 1 flight stairs, 1.5 blocks
before SOB). Possible recent PND. Does not follow Na-restricted
diet. No h/o asthma, COPD, or CHF. [**Month (only) 116**] have had recent occ HA
and vision 'blurring' per wife.

.
ECG ([**11-14**]): sinus. 69bpm. LVH with isolated STE V3 and TWI
V5-6, not significantly changed from prior.
.
CXR, portable ([**11-14**]):
1) ETT well positioned, though the balloon cuff may be minimally
hyperinflated.
2) Allowing for differences in technique, no interval change in
pulmonary edema.
.
CXR, 2-view ([**11-17**]):Compared with [**2173-11-15**], post-extubation with
partial interval clearing of the CHF and effusions.  The left
lung base is now better aerated. A small residual effusion is
noted on the left.
No consolidating pulmonary infiltrates appreciated.
.
RUQ ultrasound ([**11-19**]):
1.  Normal gallbladder.
2.  Simple right renal cyst.
.
Cath ([**11-16**]):
COMMENTS:
1. Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system
demonstrated 2 vessel coronary artery disease. The LMCA had no
angiographically apparent coronary artery disease. The LAD had
mid
vessel 50% stenosis. The D! was a large vessel with 70% stenosis
at its
origin. The LCX had mild luminal irregularities. The RCA was a
small
vessel with 70-80% mid vssel stenosis.
2. Resting hemodynamics were performed. The right sided filling
pressures were mildly elevated (mean RA pressure was 12mmHg and
RVEDP
was 14mmHg). The pulmonary artery pressures were mildly elevated
(mean
PA pressure was 25mmHg). The left sided filling pressures were
mildly
elevated (mean PCW pressure was 12mmHg). The systemic arterial
pressure
was mildly elevated measuring 142/76mmHg. The cardiac index was
within
normal range measuring 2.8l/min/m2.
3. Selective renal aniography demonstrated no renal artery
stenosis.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. 2 vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Mildly elevated right and left sided filling pressures.
Mildly
elvated pulmonary artery pressure and systemic arterial
pressure.
3. Normal cardiac index.
4. No anigrographically apparent renal artery stenosis.
.
CT head ([**11-20**]):
Significantly motion limited study.  Allowing for these
limitations, no obvious intracranial hemorrhage or large major
vascular
territorial infarction, though if suspicion remains high for the
latter, MRI would be more sensitive to assess.
.
MRI/MRA brain and neck ([**11-21**]):
1.  Multiple, scattered foci diffusion-weighted imaging
abnormality within the cerebral hemispheres bilaterally,
consistent with small areas of infarction. The distribution is
most compatible with an embolic etiology, with a low
flow/watershed distribution being a secondary diagnostic
consideration.
2.  MRA of the neck and circle [**Location (un) 431**] are significantly degraded
by motion. Major tributaries of the circle of [**Location (un) 431**] appear
patent.  A high-grade stenosis of the proximal right vertebral
artery is identified.
.
CTA head and neck ([**11-22**]):
1.  Evolving small areas of infarction within the cerebral
hemispheres
bilaterally, most compatible with an thromboembolic disease.
2.  Extensive atherosclerotic disease with stenosis of the
cavernous portions of the carotid arteries bilaterally.  CTA of
the circle of [**Location (un) 431**] is otherwise unremarkable.
.
Prior studies -
.
ETT ([**8-/2165**]): [**Doctor First Name **] 4.5 min. Test terminated secondary to
hypertensive BP response to low level exercise. No anginal type
symptoms or ischemic EKG changes. Nonspecific ST-T wave changes
noted late in recovery.
.

Brief Hospital Course:
65M h/o poorly controlled HTN, DM2, hyperlipidemia, obesity
presents with acute respiratory distress [**2-4**] CHF exacerbation
s/p intubation. Extubated and SOB resolved s/p diuresis.
Transferred to floor but developed hypotension [**2-4**] meds
(received labetalol and captopril together) with SBP 70's and
given IVFs, glucagon, levophed and transferred back to CCU.
Hypotension resolved and weaned off levophed. Acute CVA likely
related to hypotensive episode.
.
# Hypertension: difficult to control. hypertensive urgency at
presentation with SBP 292, started on nitro gtt with good
response, weaned off prior to coming to CCU but then restarted
while titrating up po meds. hypotensive episode [**11-17**] on
labetalol, captopril, norvasc. remained hypertensive, slowly
increased PO meds. discharged labetalol to 400mg tid and
lisinopril 30mg qd. goal SBP 140-160, patient does not tolerate
low BPs. will need long-term outpatient titration of BP meds.
.
# Pump: EF 40%. inferior akinesis. LVH on ECG. likely diastolic
dysfunction given longstanding HTN however concern for ischemic
component with depressed EF. pro-BNP 4000 and volume overloaded
at presentation; diuresed initially and euvolemic at discharge
without lasix requirement. extubated [**11-15**]. cath revealed CAD
but no intervention performed. cont BB, ACEi. 2gm Na/cardiac
diet, fluid restriction 1500cc. patient received nutrition
consult for dietary teaching.
.
# CAD: 80% RCA and 70% D1, no intervention given no angina and
deemed not culprit. multiple risk factors and inferior akinesis
on echo. prior excercise test stopped due to hypertension. ST
changes on surface ECG likely repolarization abnormalities [**2-4**]
LVH. ROMI with cardiac biomarkers negative x 3. discharge on
ASA/statin/BB/ACEi. consider outpatient stress test when
medically optimized if symptomatic.
.
# Rhythm: sinus. monitored on telemetry with no events.
.
# Neuro: somnolent with right arm/face weakness 2 days following
hypotensive event.
