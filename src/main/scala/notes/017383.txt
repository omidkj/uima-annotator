LABORATORY DATA:  On admission were essentially unremarkable.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was taken to the Cardiac
Catheterization Laboratory on [**2158-4-12**].  Catheterization
revealed two vessel coronary artery disease, significantly
decreased left ventricular function and pulmonary
hypertension.

On [**2158-4-13**], the patient underwent a diagnostic angiogram
secondary to 100 millimeter gradient and systolic blood
pressure from the right to the left arm and she was found to
have a totally occluded left subclavian artery.  Attempt to
open the artery with angioplasty was unsuccessful.  They were
not able to pass the wire across the lesion.

On [**2158-4-14**], the patient was taken to the operating room with
Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] where she underwent coronary artery bypass
graft times two with saphenous vein to the left anterior
descending and saphenous vein to the diagonal.

Postoperatively, she was transported to the cardiac surgery
recovery room from the operating room in stable condition on
intravenous Milrinone, Nipride and insulin drip.  She was
atrially paced.  On postoperative day one, the patient was
weaned from mechanical ventilator and was extubated, however,
over the course of the next two days, the patient was noted
to have decreasing urine output, decreasing cardiac output
and requirement for inotropic support.

On [**2158-4-17**], postoperative day three, an echocardiogram was
obtained which revealed a left ventricular ejection fraction
of 20%, decreased right ventricular function, 2+ mitral
regurgitation and mild pulmonary hypertension.  The following
day the patient was taken to the Cardiac Catheterization
Laboratory to evaluate coronary artery disease and patency of
saphenous vein grafts due to her continued need for inotropic
support.

Catheterization revealed low cardiac output, revealed a 90%
occlusion of her saphenous vein to the diagonal coronary
artery graft as well as 80% left anterior descending lesion.
There was an attempt made to stent the saphenous vein to the
diagonal graft, however, this resulted in dehiscence of the
anastomosis as well as a free perforation into the left
ventricle and pericardium.  An intra-aortic balloon pump was
placed at that time due to hemodynamic instability.

The patient was transported emergently to the operating room
with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] where she underwent repair of the
anastomosis.  Postoperatively, the patient was transported
from the operating room to the Cardiac Surgery recovery room
with intravenous Milrinone and Dobutamine as well as an
intra-aortic balloon pump for support.  The patient was kept
sedated and mechanically ventilated over the next two to
three days where she stabilized hemodynamically.

On [**2158-4-21**], the intra-aortic balloon pump was weaned and
discontinued as were her inotropics at that time.  However,
the following 24 to 48 hours resulted in worsening cardiac
function requiring intra-aortic balloon pump to be replaced
and inotropic support to be resumed.  The patient over the
next week or so underwent a very slow wean of inotropic
support.  Her intra-aortic balloon pump was discontinued a
few days later.

On [**2158-4-24**], the patient went to the Electrophysiology
Laboratory for placement of a DDD permanent pacemaker due to
continued need for pacemaker support and need to suppress
atrial fibrillation which was resulting in bradycardic
rhythms.

Over the next week or so, the patient remained on low dose
Milrinone and Dobutamine.  She required continued ventilatory
support.  On [**2158-5-10**], the patient had a PICC line for
continued intravenous access placed due to finding of a
positive catheter tip culture of her central line which
revealed E. coli as well as Enterococcus which were
pansensitive.  The patient has had no subsequent positive
blood cultures and that line was discontinued.

The patient was transferred on [**2158-5-10**], to the Surgical
Intensive Care Unit/Critical Care Service due to continued
need for intensive care support. On [**2158-5-11**], the patient
underwent tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic
gastrostomy placement by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 951**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 952**].  The patient
tolerated this procedure well and continued very slow wean
from ventilator support over the next week or so.

On [**2158-5-15**], the patient received a neurology consultation
due to generalized lethargy, decreased movement of all her
extremities and her decreased responsiveness mentally.  It
was their thought that the patient had generalized neuropathy
and myopathy and the recommendation was to obtain an EMG
which is scheduled to be done tomorrow, [**2158-5-18**].  The
patient also underwent a left upper extremity ultrasound due
to swelling of the left arm and this resulted in a negative
study for deep vein thrombosis.

Most recent laboratory values on the patient are as follows,
from [**2158-5-17**], white blood cell count 7.7, hematocrit 30.2,
platelet count 167,000.  Sodium 144, potassium 4.8, chloride
109, CO2 26, blood urea nitrogen 53, creatinine 0.8, glucose
164.  Most recent Digoxin level is from [**2158-5-16**], which
revealed a level of 1.8.  This is down from previous levels
of as high as 3.7 approximately four days prior to this.
Procainamide level on [**2158-5-16**], was 4.7 with NAPA of 17.8 at
that time.

Most recent culture data are as follows:  On [**2158-5-13**], the
patient had a stool culture sent for C. difficile which was
negative.  Central line which was discontinued on [**2158-5-9**],
was positive for E. coli as well as Enterococcus.  All
subsequent blood cultures have been negative with the
exception of yeast in her sputum and urine from [**2158-5-2**].
