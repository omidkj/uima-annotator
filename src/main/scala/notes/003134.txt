Service:  [**Last Name (un) **]


ADMISSION DIAGNOSIS:  Descending thoracic aortic
pseudoaneurysm.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 71-year-old gentleman
with a history of peripheral vascular disease and COPD with
hypertension and coronary artery disease, who presented to
the Emergency Department with 10 days of cough, shortness of
breath, and chest pain.  Patient had been seen earlier in the
week and started on Zithromax for presumed respiratory
infection.  However, he returned on the day prior to
admission with recurrent cough.  CTA done at that time showed
a partially thrombosed pseudoaneurysm or penetrating ulcer of
the aortic arch approximately 2.5 cm distal to the takeoff of
the left subclavian artery with diffuse emphysematous
changes, no pulmonary embolus.

He was started on esmolol for blood pressure control, given
an elevated pressure of 175/48 when he was admitted.  He had
appropriate monitoring placed including an A line and a Foley
catheter, and admission laboratories were significant for a
hematocrit of 41.4 and a BUN and creatinine of 26 and 1.4.
His EKG did not show ischemic changes and his CK's and
troponins were negative initially.  Vascular Surgery and
Cardiothoracic Surgery services were consulted and he was
admitted to the Intensive Care Unit on the Vascular Surgery
service.

MEDICATIONS:
1. Albuterol.
2. [**Doctor First Name **].
3. Lipitor 20 mg by mouth every day.
4. Cartia XT 300 mg by mouth every day.
5. Ecotrin 325 mg by mouth every day.
6. Hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg by mouth every day.
7. Protonix 40 mg by mouth every day.
8. Serevent every day.


SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is a former smoker.  He quit in
[**2160-5-15**] with a greater than 30 pack year history.  Denies
ingestion of alcohol.

INITIAL PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 96.9, heart rate
64, blood pressure initially 131/73 down to 110/57 after
institution of esmolol, 93 percent.  He was alert and in no
acute distress.  His heart was regular with no murmurs, rubs,
or gallops.  His chest was clear to auscultation with
diminished breath sounds in the bases.  His abdomen was
moderately obese with normoactive bowel sounds, soft, and
nontender.  Extremities were warm without clubbing, cyanosis,
or edema.  He had palpable femoral pulses bilaterally and
Dopplerable popliteal, DP and PT bilaterally with monophasic
DP and PT on the left.

STUDIES:  CTA:  No pulmonary embolus.  A 3 cm partially
thrombosed pseudoaneurysm versus penetrating ulcer of aortic
arch 2.5 cm distal to the takeoff of the left subclavian
artery, diffuse emphysematous changes.

Chest x-ray:  No new infiltrate.

BRIEF HOSPITAL COURSE:  As stated above, Mr. [**Known lastname 13029**] was
admitted to the ICU for blood pressure control on an esmolol
drip.  He remained without recurrent chest pain and he had a
MRI/MRA done of his chest to further delineate his anatomy.
Of note, there were two small outpouchings of contrast from
the lumen of the inferior portion of the aortic arch
surrounded by large thrombus component with some thickening
of the aortic wall and no evidence of active bleeding or free
fluid.  There were additionally multiple irregularities in
the aortic wall throughout the entire thoracic and abdominal
aorta that was visualized.  This was thought to represent an
unusual appearance of a penetrating ulcer with a large
thrombus component.

He additionally had a cardiac catheterization to evaluate for
any underlying coronary artery disease should he need
operative repair.  This revealed 90 percent stenosis of his
right coronary artery, saphenous vein graft with patent vein
grafts to the OM and patent LIMA to the LAD with diffuse
disease in the distal LAD.  A Heparin-coated stent was placed
in the vein graft to the right coronary artery.

Other findings from his catheterization revealed an 80
percent instent stenosis of the left vertebral artery and an
80 percent right brachiocephalic ostial lesion.  He tolerated
the procedure well and there were no bleeding or groin
complications.  He returned to the Intensive Care Unit for
continued blood pressure monitoring and his esmolol drip was
eventually weaned off.

Given the patient's multiple medical problems including his
severe pulmonary disease, underlying coronary artery disease,
and overall debilitated condition, the decision was made to
proceed with medical management as the postoperative
management of this likely penetrating ulcer.  He was
transitioned to oral agents.  His diltiazem dose was
increased and Lopressor was added for additional rate
control.  He remained off drips for greater than 48 hours.
Decision was made to send him home with close followup.  Of
note, his hematocrit remained stable.  His creatinine
remained within its baseline of around 1.4 and he was
tolerating a regular diet and able to ambulate without
difficulty.

Of note, because of his complaint of cough, a sputum sample
was sent, which grew out Pseudomonas that was [**Last Name (LF) 7384**],
[**First Name3 (LF) **] he was started on ciprofloxacin on [**2161-12-22**].
Follow-up chest x-ray revealed bilateral lower lobe changes
concerning for pneumonia.  He remained afebrile with normal
white count.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:  Penetrating ulcer versus thrombosed
pseudoaneurysm of the descending thoracic aorta.

Coronary artery disease status post right coronary artery
saphenous vein graft stent with Heparin-coated stent.

Bilateral lower lobe pneumonia.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1. Salmeterol.
2. Flovent.
3. Lipitor 20 mg by mouth every day.
4. Tylenol as needed.
5. Aspirin 325 mg by mouth every day.
6. Hydrochlorothiazide 50 mg by mouth every day.
7. Diltiazem sustained release 360 mg by mouth every day.
8. Lopressor 12.5 mg by mouth twice a day.
9. Ciprofloxacin 500 mg by mouth every 12 hours times seven
   days additional.


DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:  Patient is to have his blood
pressure checked 3-4 times per week and communicate these
results with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and his primary care doctor.  He
should call if his systolic blood pressure is greater than
110 or less than 90.  Complete a 10 day course of
ciprofloxacin to take seven additional days and to call Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] should he have recurrent chest discomfort.  Follow
up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in one month with a CTA of his chest,
with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 1169**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], his primary care doctor in two
weeks.
