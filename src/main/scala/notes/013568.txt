Pertinent Results:
CT abdomen and pelvis [**2116-7-21**]:
IMPRESSION: 1) Small bowel obstruction with a transition point
within the mid to distal small bowel and wall thickening within
small bowel. No evidence of pneumatosis, mesenteric gas, or
portal venous gas.

These findings were discussed with the surgical team responsible
for this patient's care shortly after interpretation.

2) Sigmoid diverticulosis.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was diagnosed with a small bowel obstruction with a
transition point and the patient was taken to the operating room
for an emergent exploratory laparatomy and right inguinal hernia
repair.  The patient, from the beginning of his stay, began
having intermittent SVT.  He had one episode in the ED that was
resolved with adenosine.  He had a post op hematocrit of 27, for
which he recieved 2 units of packed red blood cells.  The
patient was placed on telemetry, and had a two further
occurence of SVT that required IV lopressor and diltiazem, and a
diltiazem drip was started.  Cardiology was conuslted and their
recommendations wer followed.  The hematology oncology team also
saw the patient on postoperative day 1, and suggested continuing
the prednisone for his myelodysplastic syndrome.  the patient
was rate controlled and switched to intermittent metoprolol and
diltiazem,  On postoperative day 2 the patient was sent to the
surgical VICU with telemetry on this regimen for his heart
control.  he was also started on his home medications.  The
patient had an echocardiogram on post op day 3, because the
patient had continued intermittent, spontaneously resolving
bouts of SVT.  Cardiology also felt that this might be
intermittent atrial tachycardia, but suggested no further
changes in his management.  He was slightly confused and not at
his baseline, and a CT was done which was negative.

Pn post operative day 4, we were called to the bedside for
decrease oxygen saturation to 89%.  The patient was unarousable
and non verbal.  He was diaphortic.  He had not had any recent
sedative/pain control.  The patient had an ABG that was
7.06/85/75/26/-8.  Given his respiratory failure and CO2
narcosis, anesthesia was called and the patient was intubated
for respiratory failure.  He was transferred from the VICU to
the surgical intensive care unit.  The patient also began
receiving amiodirone for his episodes of rapid heart rate.  he
remained stable on the vent on postoperative day 5, although he
continued to have intermittent runs of SVT, and like all
previously episodes, he remained completely hemodynamically
stable otherwise.  He also was receiving tube feed for
nutritional support

Weaning from the ventilator was started on post operative day 6.
 he continued to be given lasix for respitroaory assistance.
His INR jumped to 6.0, and FFP and vitamin K were given to
correct this.  He was extubated on post operative day 6.  he
remain somnolent, moving all extremities, but was weak.  His
tube feeds were held over concern of aspiratoin, but on post
operative day 7 the patient's mental status began improving and
his tube feeds were restarted.  He had one unstable run of SVT
that converted after 1 dose of adenosine, and 2 stabe runs of
SVT that converted after vagal maneuvers.  He was evaluated by
speech and swallow who demonstrated no aspiration.  On
Postoperative day 9, the patients tube feeds were discontinued,
he was started on clear liquids.  His mental status had
improved.  He had increased  his lopressor to 150 TID.

He was transferred to the floor in stable condition.  He
continued to have intermittent bouts of stable SVT.  He was
evaluated by physical therapy and occupational therapy for his
qualification for rehab.  He was tolerating a regular diet
without difficulty.
