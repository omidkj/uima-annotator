CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Admission for hyperkalemia and transferred
to the Coronary Care Unit for fluid overload.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 66-year-old Russian
male with a past medical history for known coronary artery
disease and chronic renal insufficiency with a creatinine
between 2 and 2.5, recently admitted for [**11-9**] for
asymptomatic hyperkalemia after increase in Aldactone as an
outpatient.

The patient had been admitted to the hospital in [**Month (only) 216**] on
Lasix but had creatinine bumps and therefore was discharged
without Lasix.  During the interim time he was restarted on
Lasix, potassium, and spironolactone.  Approximately one week
prior to admission he was seen by his primary care physician
who discontinued Lasix and increased Aldactone from one-half
pill to three pills.

On the day of admission he was seen by his primary care
physician with laboratories showing potassium of 7.4, but was
asymptomatic.  At the time he decided to go to the Emergency
Department.  Electrocardiogram showed minimally peaked T
waves, left axis deviation, and sinus bradycardia.  He was
given 30 g of Kayexalate, lactulose, calcium, and bicarbonate
in the Emergency Department.  In the intervening day, he
received additional doses of Kayexalate and lactulose times
three with potassium decreasing to 5.1.

On [**2118-11-10**], he [**Year (4 digits) 1834**] 4-liter large volume
paracentesis with supplemental albumin.  On the day of
transfer (on [**11-11**]) another 3.5 liters of fluid was
removed.  Mr. [**Known lastname 105732**] has a history of severe ascites which
tested hepatitis B and hepatitis C negative.  It was thought
to be secondary to severe right heart failure.  He was
without complaints of shortness of breath or other
discomforts.  Prior to large-volume paracentesis he did have
some mild abdominal distention which is much improved.

He is being transferred to the Coronary Care Unit for right
heart catheterization and aggressive diuresis and blood
pressure management.  Of note, the patient's history is
significant for creatinine bumps to 3 with diuresis with
Lasix and increased potassium with Aldactone.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Coronary artery disease, status post inferior myocardial
infarction in [**2116-3-26**].  Status post coronary artery
bypass graft in [**2116-3-26**] with saphenous vein graft to
left internal mammary artery, saphenous vein graft to
diagonal with sequential graft to the first obtuse marginal,
and saphenous vein graft to the posterior descending artery.
Operation was complicated by cardiogenic shock requiring
intra-aortic balloon pump.  Postoperative course complicated
by sepsis requiring bilateral below-knee amputations.  He
suffered stump infections with pseudomonas and
methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
2.  Hypothyroidism.
3.  Chronic renal insufficiency with creatinine between 2
and 2.5.
4.  Upper gastrointestinal bleed.
5.  Gout.
6.  Congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction
of 20%.
7.  Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia.
8.  Severe mitral regurgitation.
9.  History of ascites.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1.  Allopurinol 200 mg p.o. q.d.
2.  Aldactone.
3.  Levoxyl 175 mcg p.o. q.d.
4.  Isordil 10 mg p.o. t.i.d.
5.  Zoloft 100 mg p.o. q.d.
6.  Digoxin 0.125 mg p.o. q.d.
7.  Hydralazine 25 mg p.o. q.i.d.

MEDICATIONS ON TRANSFER:  Medications on transfer to the
Coronary Care Unit included all of the above in addition to
Lasix 40 mg p.o. b.i.d. and Tylenol p.r.n.

ALLERGIES:  Allergy to KEFLEX and HEPARIN (heparin-induced
thrombocytopenia).

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient denies tobacco or alcohol use.
His is a Russian immigrant.

FAMILY HISTORY:   Family history is noncontributory.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  On admission
temperature was 98.4, blood pressure 110/72, pulse 72,
respiratory rate 20, satting 95% on room air.  In general, he
was a moderately obese male with protruding abdomen, lying in
bed, in no acute distress.  HEENT revealed jugular venous
distention elevated beyond the angle of the jaw of
approximately 20 cm.  Cardiovascular revealed there was a [**3-1**]
quiet systolic murmur at the apex.  Lungs on anterior
examination were clear to auscultation.  The abdomen had
normal active bowel sounds, nontender, distended with fluid.
No masses.  Extremities were clean, dry, and intact.
Bilateral below-knee amputations, no swelling.

LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:  Laboratories on transfer,
Chem-7 showed the following:  Sodium 140, potassium 5.1,
chloride 113, bicarbonate 18, BUN 39, creatinine 2.4,
sugar 86.  Albumin 2.6, calcium 8.1, phosphate 3.7,
magnesium 2.1.  Digoxin level of 0.7.  Of note, potassium had
decreased from 7.4 to 7.1 to 6 to 5.8 to 5.1 times three
consecutive times.

RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:   Electrocardiogram on [**11-9**] showed
evidence for old inferior myocardial infarction with Q waves
in leads III and aVF; first-degree heart block, poor R wave
progression.  On [**11-10**], there was evidence for
first-degree heart block with occasional sinus nodal block
with a junctional escape.

Echocardiogram from [**2117-7-27**] showed mildly dilated left
atrium, markedly dilated right atrium, left ventricular
systolic function markedly decreased with dyskinesis of the
basal anteroseptal, middle anteroseptal, and basal and middle
inferoseptal regions.  There was also akinesis of the basal
inferior, middle inferior, basal and middle inferolateral,
and inferoapical regions.  There was also evidence for 1+
aortic regurgitation, 4+ mitral regurgitation, and 4+
tricuspid regurgitation.  Ejection fraction at that time
was 20%.

HOSPITAL COURSE:

1.  FLUIDS/ELECTROLYTES/NUTRITION:  As stated above,
Mr. [**Known lastname 105734**] potassium elevation was likely secondary to
Aldactone.  In the future he should no longer receive
Aldactone or ACE inhibitors, much less any medication that
would elevate potassium, as Mr. [**Known lastname 105732**] seems particularly
sensitive to these medications.  He was placed on a
low-sodium/low-potassium diet.

2.  CARDIOVASCULAR:  (a)  Coronary artery disease:
Mr. [**Known lastname 105732**] has a history of coronary artery disease but was
not on aspirin on admission.  He was placed on aspirin.

(b)  Pump:  Mr. [**Known lastname 105732**] had an ejection fraction of 20% and
ischemic cardiomyopathy.  He has signs of right-sided failure
without symptoms except for his tense ascites.  Liver
function tests were checked for possible passive congestion
but were within normal limits. They were only significant for
alkaline phosphatase of around 200.

On transfer to the Coronary Care Unit, he [**Known lastname 1834**] right
internal jugular introduction with Swan placement soon after.
Initial Swan numbers were the following:
