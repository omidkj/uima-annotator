Admission Date:  [**2135-4-21**]       Discharge Date:  [**2135-5-10**]

Date of Birth:   [**2069-8-5**]       Sex:  F

Service:  GEN [**Doctor First Name 147**]

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 64 year old female
with multiple medical problems including chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease, diastolic congestive heart failure,
history of pulmonary embolism in [**2134-3-13**], diabetes
mellitus, cerebrovascular accident times two, among other
medical problems, who was admitted for acute onset of acute
mental status changes and fever.  She was recently admitted
to [**Hospital1 69**] from [**2135-3-29**] until
[**2135-4-8**], for right lower lobe pneumonia, acute mental
status changes, Clostridium difficile colitis,
supratherapeutic INR and rule out myocardial infarction.  Her
Lasix was held during her hospitalization due to hypotension.
Her acute mental status changes at that time were attributed
to an infection and dehydration.

Per the patient's daughter, the patient was doing well after
her recent discharge and was gradually improving every day.
The patient had been residing at her [**Hospital3 **]
facility.  After eating dinner on the night prior to
admission, the patient was noted to have acute mental status
changes.  The patient was then sent to [**Hospital1 190**] Emergency Department.  Per the patient's
daughter, the patient has had no complaints over the last two
weeks except for a headache five days prior to admission
which resolved with Tylenol.  She has no known ill contacts.

In the Emergency Room, the patient was noted to have a fever
to 104.0 F., and was disoriented.  Chest x-ray was consistent
with a right lower lobe pneumonia, questionably improved from
her last admission.  Her white blood cell count was elevated
at 27.0 with 7% bands.  Her systolic blood pressure had
dropped to 70/palpable and she was given one liter of normal
saline with improvement in blood pressure only to 80/53.  She
was started on an additional 500 cc of normal saline with
stabilization of her blood pressure at 140/90.  The patient
was also started on ceftriaxone, Azithromycin and Tylenol.  A
CT scan of her head was performed.

ALLERGIES:

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On initial evaluation, the patient was
febrile with a temperature of 104.6 F.; heart rate 92; blood
pressure 70/palpable and improved to 162/97 with fluids;
respiratory rate 12; 97% on four liters.  She was somnolent
and was tremulous.  Her pupils were equal, round and reactive
to light.  Extraocular muscles are intact.  Oropharynx is
clear with no tongue lesions.  She had facial twitching.  She
had no jugular venous distention and her neck was supple.
Her left side of her lung was clear to auscultation; the
right side had rales but no wheezes.  Her heart was regular
rate with a normal S1 and S2.  Her abdomen had a midline
surgical scar with the J-tube site healed.  Her abdomen was
soft, nontender, nondistended with positive bowel sounds.
She had no lower extremity edema.  She had diminished
dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses bilaterally.  She
had good capillary refill.  She had no rashes.  She followed
occasional commands and was oriented to place only.  She had
good tone in her upper and lower extremities.

LABORATORY:  The patient's CBC was as follows:  White blood
cell count 27.0 with 87% neutrophils, 7% bands and 4%
lymphocytes.  Hematocrit 30.9, platelets 574.  Her
electrolytes were as follows:  Sodium 139, potassium 4.4,
chloride 99, bicarbonate 31, BUN 22, creatinine 1.3, glucose
91.  Her INR was 2.4.  Calcium was 8.2, phosphorus 3.5,
magnesium 1.0.  ESR was 88.  ALT was 7, AST 14, Total
bilirubin 0.2.  Lactate level was 3.3, repeated and found to
be 1.4.

STUDIES:  Chest x-ray done in the Emergency Room revealed a
right lower lobe / right middle lobe infiltrate, questionable
improvement from her prior admission.

CT scan of her head was done as well.  The CT scan of her
head revealed no acute intracranial hemorrhage or mass
effect.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was initially admitted to the
[**Year (4 digits) **] Service.  Her acute mental status changes were
thought to be due to multiple etiologies which included
infection, cerebrovascular accident, seizures with post ictal
phase, metabolic abnormalities, medication use.  There was
thought to be a very low suspicion for meningitis.  A CT scan
of her head was found to be normal.  She was continued on her
Trileptal.  Her Neurontin was held.  Her MS Contin and Reglan
were held as well.

Her mental status significantly improved during the initial
part of her hospital course.  By hospital day three, the
patient was alert and oriented times three.  She was able to
follow commands and was appropriately responding to
questions.

The etiology for the patient's fever and leukocytosis with
bandemia were of unclear source.  It was suspected that a
partially treated pneumonia or Clostridium difficile colitis
were likely sources.  Her repeat lactate level was 1.1.
Sputum cultures, blood cultures, urine cultures, were
periodically drawn during her hospital course.  Clostridium
difficile toxin came back as negative on several occasions
during her hospital course.

The patient's hypotension during the first few days of her
hospital course was closely monitored.  On hospital day one,
while in the Emergency Room, the patient's blood pressure
significantly responded to intravenous fluid boluses.  Her
urine output was supposed to be monitored.  Her Lasix was
held.

The patient was continued on her Coumadin at a dose of 5 mg
p.o. q. day given her history of pulmonary embolism.  Daily
INR levels were monitored.  The patient was made NPO until
her mental status cleared.  A right subclavian central line
was placed for fluid hydration.

The patient, while on the [**Year (4 digits) **] Service, was kept in the
Medical Intensive Care Unit from hospital day one until
hospital day two.

On hospital day two, the patient had a CT scan of her abdomen
performed and the results of that revealed no evidence of
obstruction or perforation.  Findings were consistent with
colitis including an infectious colitis.  The study was
limit
