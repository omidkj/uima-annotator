Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Penicillins

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 30**]
Chief Complaint:
Pleuritic chest pain


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Heimlich valve at [**Hospital3 3765**] for PTX

History of Present Illness:
85M with a PMh s/f severe COPD on chronic O2, complete heart
block s/p PMP [**7-21**], PVD s/p bilateral carotid endarterectomies
in [**2111**], HTN, HLD presents to presented to [**Hospital3 7569**]
w/chief complaint of chest pain and shortness of breath since
the AM. He had a recent hospitalization for MI and PNA, and had
completed a 2 week course of PNA on Sunday. At home, he denied
any F, C, N/V, but endorsed pleureitic L sided chest pain and
shortness of breath.
.
He initally was taken to [**Hospital3 **], and was given nitro
gtt, briefly was on a heparin gtt, and was given Levofloxacin
for a worsening LLL PNA. The plan was then to transfer to [**Hospital1 **]
since this is where he receives his cardiology care, for sats
70's-80's on facemask prior to switching to nrb, then improved
to low 90s for a cards evalulation. While he was in the
ambulance, radiology at [**Location (un) **] stat notified our ED of a
finding of a 30% left PTX. The ambulance was thus directed to
the nearest hospital, which turned out to be [**Hospital1 **]. At
[**Hospital1 **], his left PTX was relieved with a Heimlich valve device,
which on our repeat CXR shows resolution. The patient then
reported improved SOB, but still some mild L CP with
inspiration.
.
In the ED, initial VS were:  99.0 110 170/91 20 98% cont neb
.
Labs were notable for HCT 36.2, INR 1.4.
.
He was given Aspirin 325mg, and 4 mg Morphine Sulfate.
.
CXR was notable for interval resolution of the PTX.
  .
On arrival to the MICU, he is AAOx3, surrounded by his family,
and comfortable. His family says that he had a slightly worse
cough,a lthough he has a chronic cough at baseline, although he
denies his cough is any worse.

CXR [**2-26**]:
IMPRESSION: Bibasilar opacities, left greater than right, raises
concern for an infection/pneumonia and/or aspiration. Blunting
of the left costophrenic angle may be due to a small pleural
effusion. Bibasilar atelectasis.

A tubular structure/catheter extending into the left lung apex
with possible tiny left apical pneumothorax remaining. However,
suggest followup with removal of external artifact for better
evaluation. Upright PA and lateral views may be helpful for
further evaluation when/if patient able.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2120-2-28**]
The left pigtail is in place. The left lower lobe consolidation
has
substantially improved. Heart size and mediastinum are overall
unchanged.
The assessment of the lung bases still demonstrate bilateral
pleural effusion, small on the right and most likely small to
moderate on the left.



Brief Hospital Course:
85M with a PMh s/f severe COPD on chronic O2, complete heart
block s/p PMP [**7-21**], PVD s/p bilateral carotid endarterectomies
in [**2111**], HTN, HLD presents with pleuritic pain and found to have
a L PTX.

# PTX/Chest Pain: Has remained hemodynamically stable since
arrival to the hosptial. Has a Heimlich valve device in place,
and is oxygenating well, without new development of PTX. Most
likely the pt developed a PTX from the bursting of a bleb as a
complication of severe COPD. The pt was ruled out for an MI with
CE. He was weaned down to 2L of O2 NC which is his home O2
requirement. Interventional pulmonology removed the Heimlich
valve without complication.
.
# LLL infiltrate: CXR this hospitalization shows a LLL opacity.
The pt just completed a two week course of antibiotics
prescribed by his PCP for treatment of pneumonia. The pt was
afebrile, without a leukocytosis and cough. There was no
evidence of infection currently and most likely this
radiographic reminence from resolving prior pneumonia. No
further antibiotics were given during this hospitalization.
.
# Acute Urinary Retention: The pt has known BPH and is on
Terazosin at home. He claims that for prior hospitalizations he
has required urinary catheterization for obstruction as well. He
was having difficulty voiding during this hospitalization. A
bladder scan revealed >1L of urine in his bladder. A foley
catheter was placed to relieve this obstruction. It was then
removed and a repeat voiding trial was obtained which showed him
to be retaining 600cc of urine in his bladder. A foley catheter
was re-inserted and a follow up appointment was made with
Urology for removal. We increased his dose of Terazosin from 2mg
to 5mg daily prior to discharge.
.
# Severe COPD on chronic oxygen treatment: Patient was quickly
weaned back down to home O2 requirements (2-3L 02 NC), without
any extra wheezing on exam.  We continued his home Advair,
Tiotroprium and nebulizers prn.
.
# Elevated INR: Chronic problem noted in this pt seen on labs
from [**2111**] where is INR was also noted to be 1.4. Pt is not on
warfarin currently. His albumin was wnl and there was no active
signs of bleeding.
.
# Hyperlipidemia/PVD: We continued
aspirin 81 mg Daily
Plavix 75 mg Daily
Zocor 10 mg Daily
Lisinopril 10 mg Daily
.
# Chronic Lower Extremity Edema- we continued
Lasix 20 mg QAM
Lasix 10 mg QPM
.
# Restless Leg Syndrome: continued
Mirapex 0.5 mg QHS
.
# Transitional- Prior to discharge a urinary catheter was placed
to relieve his urinary obstruction from BPH. He has a follow up
appointment with urology to have this removed. He also has a
follow up appointment with his PCP as well.
