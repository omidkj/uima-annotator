History of Present Illness:
57-yo female w/ HTN, dyslipidemia, and 40 pack-year smoking
history transferred from cardiac cath with atypical chest pain.
She initially presented [**7-29**] with sudden onset crushing chest
pain radiating to her jaw and both arms, SOB and diaphoresis
while at rest.  She went to [**Hospital3 **] where she works as
[**Name8 (MD) **] RN.  There her pain continued with 3 nitroglycerin but
resolved with Morphine roughly 1 hour after onset.  Her enzymes
were negative and she had only shallow TWI in III and aVF.
Subsequent stress test, LENIs, CTA chest and RUQ u/s were all
negative.  Just before she was to go home, decision was made for
trasnfer to [**Hospital1 18**] for cardiac cath.

Cardiac cath today showed 90% LAD occlusion with serial lesions,
90% proximal and 40% distal LCx occlusion and 50% proximal and
90% distal RCA occlusion, as well as LV diastolic dysfunction.
She is planned to have a CABG mid next week.  Shortly after the
cath, she began having [**6-16**] pressure under her left breast
radiating as a sharpness to her back.  Pain persisted with a
nipride drip but decreased to [**3-19**] with Versed.  She says that
she feels very anxious about the prospect of major cardiac
surgery.

On review of systems she denies recent cough, fever, chills,
vomiting, diarrhea or constipation.  At [**Hospital3 **] she had
occasional headaches that seemed to correlate with spikes in her
blood pressure.  She suffers from chronic left arm pain that she
typically treats with NSAIDs.  She does not have any shortness
of breath at baseline, though she admits that she rarely exerts
herself.  She had one other episode of chest pain 2 weeks prior
to [**7-29**] when she had sharp chest pain shortly after waking up
that persisted for about half an hour and improved
spontaneously.  She has had no recent weight loss or gain.

Most recent PCI results ([**2154-8-2**]):
1.  Selective coronary angiography of this right-dominant system

revealed three-vessel coronary artery disease. The LMCA had mild

plaquing but no significant stenoses. The LAD had serial 90%
stenosis
and heavy calcification.  The LCX was calcified and had a 90%
proximal
and 40% distal stenosis.  The RCA had a calcified 50% proximal
stenosis
and a 90% distal stenosis.
2.  Limited resting hemodynamics demonstrated elevated left
ventricular
filling pressures with an LVEDP of 25 mmHg, and no significant
gradient
across the aortic valve.
.
Carotid U/S ([**2154-8-5**]):
IMPRESSION: No evidence of internal carotid artery stenosis on
either side.

PRE-BYPASS: No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color
Doppler. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and
global systolic function are normal (LVEF>60 %). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There
are focal calcifications in the aortic arch. There are simple
atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. There are three
aortic valve leaflets. There is no aortic valve stenosis. Trace
aortic regurgitation is seen. Physiologic mitral regurgitation
is seen (within normal limits). There is a trivial/physiologic
pericardial effusion. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in person of the
results.

POST-BYPASS: For the post-bypass study, the patient was
receiving vasoactive infusions including phenylephrine.
Biventricular function is intact.
Aortic contours appear intact post decannulation.
Other findings are unchanged

Brief Hospital Course:
57-yo female w/ HTN, dyslipidemia, and 40 pack-year smoking
history transferred from cardiac cath with atypical chest pain.
Originally presented with crushing chest pain [**7-29**] and had an
extensive negative workup at [**Hospital3 **] before being
transferred here for cardiac cath.  On catheterization she was
found to have three vessel disease and is scheduled for CABG
next week.  Following cath, she began having new [**6-16**] chest
pressure and was transferred to the CCU. Brief hospital course
by problem list is as follows:
.
# Chest pain: It is unclear whether the blockages in her
coronary arteries are the source of her chest pain.  Her initial
symptoms on [**7-29**] were typical for an acute coronary syndrome,
but she ruled-out by all standard criteria (enzymes, serial ECGs
and stress test).  Other possible sources include
musculoskeletal pain, pleuritic pain and GI pain.  PE, gall
stones, and pericardial effusion were all tested for at the
[**Hospital3 **].  Pt's pain was well-controlled in the CCU; pt
was also given Versed for anxiety re: upcoming CABG. CXR ruled
out pleuritic sources for her CP (pneumothorax, pneumonia).
.
# Coronaries: Three vessel disease on cardiac cath, too
extensive for stenting and clearly suitable for CABG. Patient
was continued on IV heparin in CCU. Pre-op ECHO, CXR, carotid
U/S, PFTs, UA/UC were ordered per CT surgery. Pre-op LFTs,
HbA1c, coags were also ordered. Pt continued to be on ASA and
high dose statin for her CAD. Also stressed the importance of
smoking cessation to patient, who tolerated the nicotine patch
well.
.
# Hypertension: Hypertensive at baseline, tolerated up-titration
of her Lisinopril at the OSH. Pt was continued on higher dose
Lisinopril (20 mg) and home dose Atenolol in the CCU. She
complained of headaches which she believes are associated with
high blood pressures. Her BP during these headaches were
