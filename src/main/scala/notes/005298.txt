Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 898**]
Chief Complaint:
Fever

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Tracheal intubation
L IJ Central line placement
L-sided PICC placement
transesophageal echocardiogram x 2
prostate ultrasound

History of Present Illness:
64 yom with history of congenital heart disease s/p porcine MV
replacement, difficulty to control atrial fibrillation, diabetes
and CHF presented with a one day history of fever and malaise.
He was in his usual state of health until the 10 days leading up
to admission. He was seen by his PCP in this time for
nonproductive cough, fatigue and headache and was given
Azithromycin x 5 days. Per report, his symptoms improved until
the day of admission. On the day of admission, he was seen by
his PCP (incidentally because his wife was being evaluated) and
was noted to have a temperature of 102 and rales on exam. He was
sent to the ED for CXR and evaluation.
.
In the ED, his vitals were 102.2, 135/52, 63, 18, 95% RA. He was
given ceftriaxone and vancomycin as well as one gram of Tylenol
and admitted for work up of fever.
.
Upon arrival to the floor, Code Blue was called on the patient
for PEA arrest. This quickly became ventricular fibrillation and
he was successfully shocked X 1 360J with return of rhythm and
circulation. He was intubated on the floor and transferred to
the MICU for further management. PEA ? from acidosis.
.
In the MICU, [**6-25**] blood culture bottles grew enterococcus
sensitive to amp.  Currently on amp/gent followed by ID.
Cultures now negative.  TEE w/o veg.  PICC requested for IV
antibiotics (central line pulled w/ ? small hematoma).  ?Needs
possible CT to eval for source of infection.  Extubated 2 days
ago.  Never needed pressors.  Had alot of ectopy so loaded w/
amio but QT elongated so amio stopped.  Anticoagulated for afib
(usual dose 7-9 mg daily).  Transferred to Cardiology service w/
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] as attending.

General: oriented to person, place and date w/ prompting
HEENT: PERRL, OP with dry blood and cut lip s/p intubation.
Neck: swelling above R- clavicle and L-clavicle (may be a
hematoma per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
Car: distant heart sounds, regular

.
[**9-4**] CXR: No acute intrathoracic process.
.
[**9-5**] TEE: No evidence of prosthetic or native valve
endocarditis. No evidence of [**Month/Year (2) 4448**] lead vegetation. Normal
gradients/well seated bioprosthetic valve with mild mitral
regurgitation. Depressed left ventricular systolic function.
.
[**9-8**] Abd U/S: 1) Irregular patchy hyperechoic area in the right
liver consistent with focal fatty infiltration. No solid masses
identified in the liver. 2) Splenomegaly. 3) No ascites
identified.
.
[**9-8**] head CT: 1. No evidence of intracranial hemorrhage or mass
effect.
2. Prominent central atrophy, more than expected for pt's age.
.
[**9-10**] CT torso with PO contrast only: 1.  Limited study due to
lack of intravenous contrast [**Doctor Last Name 360**].  No evidence of fluid
collection or abscess.
2.  Patchy opacities in bilateral lower lobes, which could be
due to
atelectasis, however, pneumonia or aspiration or aspiration
pneumonia is a
consideration given bacteremia.  Please correlate clinically,
and confirm
resolution after treatment.
3.  Cardiomegaly, enlarged pulmonary arteries suggestive of
pulmonary arterial hypertension.  Please note that the
evaluation of pulmonary vasculature is limited due to lack of
intravenous contrast [**Doctor Last Name 360**].
4.  Small bilateral pleural effusion with atelectasis.
5.  Mediastinal lymphadenopathy, likely reactive.
.
[**9-10**] prostate U/S: No evidence of a prostate abscess.
.
[**9-15**] TEE: The left atrium is dilated. Moderate to severe
spontaneous echo contrast is  seen in the body of the left
atrium. No thrombus is seen in the left atrial appendage. A wire
or catheter without mass or vegetation is seen in the right
atrium which is relatively immobile, which is probably the
[**Month/Year (2) 4448**] wire. A  second highly mobile catheter is seen in the
right atrium arising from the  SVC, for which an attached mass
or thrombus cannot definitively be excldued.  LV systolic
function appears depressed. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are
mildly thickened. No masses or vegetations are seen on the
aortic valve. No  aortic regurgitation is seen. A bioprosthetic
mitral valve prosthesis is present. The prosthetic mitral valve
leaflets are thickened. The transmitral  gradient is normal for
this prosthesis. No mass or vegetation is seen on the  mitral
valve. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen, which is
appropriate for  a mitral valve prosthesis. No vegetation/mass
is seen on the pulmonic valve.
There is no pericardial effusion.

[**9-15**] PICC visualization under fluoro: Line check demonstrating
no evidence of a filling defect consistent with a thrombus or
vegetation involving the end of the in situ left PICC.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 64 year old man with congenital heart
disease s/p porcine MVR, AFib s/p PPM, and CHF with EF 30%, who
presented with fever and had PEA arrest shortly after arrival.
.
#. PEA arrest: On admission, pt arrived on floor in PEA arrest,
then changed to Vfib and pt received shock x 1 with return of
rhythm and circulation. Most likely precipitant thought to be
infection. Pt had prolonged QTc to 600 so amiodarone was stopped
shortly after initiation, and pacer was reset at 70 in increased
voltage as it was not pacing. Pt was followed by
electrophysiology team while in-house with scattered PVCs on
tele but no other arhythmic events. He should not be discharged
to home without a LifeVest (phone number 1-[**Telephone/Fax (1) 105226**])
per specific request of his electrophysiologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
He will likely need ICD placement and pacer-wire replacement
after completing his course of antibiotics and should continue
to follow with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] as an outpatient.
.
#. Enterococcal bacteremia: Pt had 7 of 8 blood cultures
positive for enterococcus faecalis on day of arrival, but
cleared cultures as of following d
