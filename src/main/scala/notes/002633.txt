History of Present Illness:
This 81 year old male recently presented with heart failure, an
indeterminate troponin check and a significant drop in his EF to
25% by nuclear study which also demononstrated an inferorapical
infarct with a small area of inferior apical ischemia. He states
he has been experiencing increasing shortness of breath with
minimal exertion. He was then referred for coronary angiogram.
He was found to have progression of left main disease and was
referred to cardiac surgery for revascularization.

He was admitted for elective operation.

Pertinent Results:
[**2190-3-15**] ECHO
PRE BYPASS The left atrium is dilated. No spontaneous echo
contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium/left
atrial appendage or the body of the right atrium/right atrial
appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color
Doppler. The left ventricular cavity is moderately dilated.
There is severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction
with apical akinesis, and severe hypokinesis of the mid to
distal anterior, anterolateral, and anteroseptal walls. There is
mild to moderate global hypokinesis on top of that. Overall
ejection fraction is about 25%. No masses or thrombi are seen in
the left ventricle. The right ventricular cavity is dilated with
mild global free wall hypokinesis and focal severe hypokinesis
of the apical free wall. [Intrinsic right ventricular systolic
function is likely more depressed given the severity of
tricuspid regurgitation.] There are simple atheroma in the
ascending aorta. There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the aortic
arch. The descending thoracic aorta is mildly dilated. There are
complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly to modertaely thickened but
aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are moderately thickened. Mild to
moderate ([**12-14**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The mitral
regurgitation has a slight anterior lean to it suggesting
slightly worse poterior leaflet restriction. Moderate to severe
[3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. Significant pulmonic
regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial effusion. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
was notified in person of the results in the operating room at
the time of the study.

POST BYPASS The patient is AV paced and receiving norepinephrine
and milrinone by infusion. Biventricular systolic function is
globally improved from the pre-bypass period. The apical right
ventricular free was is improved but mild global RV hypokineis
remains. The left ventricle has improvement in global function
but regional wall motion abnormalities noted pre-bypass persist.
EF is about 35%. The tricuspid regurgitation is somewhat
improved - now moderate. The rest of valvular function appears
unchanged from pre-bypass. The thoracic aorta is intact after
decannulation.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 12303**] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2190-3-15**] for surgical
management of his coronary artery disease. He was taken directly
to the Operating Room where he underwent coronary artery bypass
grafting x3(LIMA-LAD,SVG-OM-PDA sequentially)
with Dr.[**Last Name (STitle) **]. Cardiopulmonary Bypass time=78 minutes. Cross Clamp
time=63 minutes. Please see operative note for details.
Postoperatively he was taken to the intensive care unit for
monitoring.

He required several days of Milrinone and pressor support due to
left ventricular dysfunction.  These were weaned over several
days and after load reductuion with hydralazine substituted.
Post operatively he awoke neurologically intact and was
extubated. He developed atrial fibrillation for which Amiodarone
was started, with restoration of sinus rhythm.

He was seen by Physical Therapy for mobility  and strength and
he was transferred to the step down unit for further recovery.
He was aggressively diuresed and developed a contraction
alkalosis which was treated with potassium chloride and
acetazolamide.

Mr. [**Known lastname 12303**] continued to make steady progress.  He desired to
return home as he has home oxygen, the VNA already sees him
twice a week and his sons will stay with him around the clock.
On POD# 8 he was cleared by Dr.[**Last Name (STitle) **] for discharge to home with
VNA. All follow up appointments were advised.
