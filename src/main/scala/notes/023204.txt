Allergies:
Aspirin / Zantac / Ciprofloxacin

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2159**]
Chief Complaint:
Confusion

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
1.  Right-sided frontal craniotomy for resection.
2.  Intraoperative image guidance.
3.  Microscopic dissections.
4.  Duraplasty.
5.  Transbronchial and endobronchial biopsy


History of Present Illness:
This is a 73 year-old man with a history of hypertension, atrial
fibrillation, prostate cancer treated with surgical resection
and radiation in [**2120**], bladder diverticuli with resection,
benign parotid tumor resected in [**2115**] who presents with two
weeks of altered cognition. Patient and his wife report for the
past two weeks the patient has had episodes of staring into
space, forgetfulness, confusion and disorientation. Yesterday
the patient was at a funeral and forgot where his car was
located. With increasing concern, the patient's family decided
to bring it to medical attention at [**Hospital3 68**]. There the
patient was noted to have 17mm right frontal mass and right
perihilar mass on CT head and chest. Loaded with dilantin,
decadron started. Patient transferred here for further work-up.

.
In ER here, seen by neurosurgery who recommended dilantin,
decadron, CT torso and bone scan for staging. MRI here confirmed
mass.
.
Patient denies [**Hospital3 5162**], weight change, other complaints.

[**2122-5-1**] Portable AP
Right lower lobe/parahilar mass or consolidation with satellite
nodules, is better evaluated on concurrent CT. No pneumothorax,
post-biopsy.
.
CT PELVIS W/CONTRAST  [**2122-5-1**] 11:02 AM
1. Right hilar opacity demonstrating calcification and adjacent
bronchiectasis and satellite nodules, most suggestive of an
infectious process, of which tuberculosis is of concern.
2. Left adrenal adenoma.
3. Hypodensity within the left kidney, too small to
characterize.
.
BONE SCAN [**2122-5-1**]
No evidence of osseous metastases.
.
MR HEAD W & W/O CONTRAST  [**2122-5-1**] 12:14 AM
Large, partially cystic and solid right frontal lobe mass. In a
patient of this age, either a primary brain tumor, likely a
glioma or a solitary metastatic deposit, the latter a much less
likely diagnostic consideration, could be present. Clearly,
definitive diagnosis will be achieved via biopsy.
.
Pathology Examination
TRANSBRONCHIAL AND ENDOBRONCHIAL BXS (2).
73 y/o with remote prostate cancer and new right lung mass.
Gross: The specimen is received in two formalin containers
labeled with the patient's name, "[**Known lastname 72364**], [**Known firstname 122**]" and the
medical record number.
Part 1 is additionally labeled "right lower lobe medial basal
transbronchial biopsy" and consists of multiple fragments of
tan-brown tissue aggregating 0.4 x 0.3 x 0.2 cm, entirely
submitted in cassette A.
Part 2 is additionally labeled "endo biopsy" and consists of
multiple fragments of tan-brown soft tissue aggregating 0.2 x
less than 0.1 x less than 0.1 cm, entirely submitted in cassette
B.
.
[**2122-5-4**] ECHO
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular  hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Overall left  ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened.
There is mild aortic valve stenosis (area 1.2-1.9cm2). Mild (1+)
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There
is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.
.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2122-5-6**] 8:07 PM
Post right frontal mass resection and frontal craniotomy, with
postoperative changes and small amount of hemorrhage, persistent
vasogenic edema and shift of normally midline structures.
.
MR HEAD W/ CONTRAST  [**2122-5-6**] 5:53 AM
This study was performed for operative planning and has limited
diagnostic utility. Again seen is a 4-cm cystic and solid mass
centered within the right frontal parasagittal region, with
marked compression of the corpus callosum and contiguous lateral
ventricles. There is promiennt surrounding edema. There is 9-mm
leftward shift of the midline structures. There is a sickle
shaped area of fluid attenuation within the left sublenticular
region, which is unchanged and may represent a chronic small
vessel infarction or unusually configured sublenticular cyst.
There is mucosal thickening of the frontal and ethmoid sinuses
and slight mucosal thickening within the maxillary sinuses,
inflamamtory in origin.
1. Limited study for preoperative planning.
2. Large cystic and solid right frontal mass with prominent
surrounding edema and compression of the genu of the corpus
callosum and adjacent lateral ventricles.
.
[**5-6**] brain biopsy:
#1, RIGHT FRONTAL TUMOR BIOPSY (including intraoperative smear):
METASTATIC MODERATELY DIFFERENTIATED ADENOCARCINOMA, consistent
with metastasis from lung primary.
#2, RIGHT FRONTAL TUMOR RESECTION:
METASTATIC MODERATELY DIFFERENTIATED ADENOCARCINOMA, consistent
with metastasis from lung primary.
.
[**5-8**] cxr:
IMPRESSION: Increasing size of right perihilar mass and
associated right lower lobe consolidation. The rapid interval
progression suggests an underlying infectious etiology. There is
also a new left pleural effusion.
.
[**5-13**] LE veins:
IMPRESSION:
1) Occlusive thrombus from the popliteal vein to the mid
superficial femoral vein on the left.
2) No DVT on the right.
.
[**5-14**] ct head:
NON-CONTRAST HEAD CT SCAN: Post-surgical changes are again noted
as such. There has been a right frontal craniotomy.
Pneumocephalus is slightly decreased from [**5-8**]. Extra-axial
fluid appears similar in degree. There is no new large
intracranial hemorrhage. Small amounts of blood layering
posteriorly within the occipital horns of lateral ventricles
appears similar to slightly decreased compared to [**5-8**].
There is slightly leftward shift of the normally midline
structures anteriorly, possibly in part related to slightly
decreased pneumocephalus. The third ventricle is slightly more
prominent, though the lateral ventricles appear quite similar in
configuration. A large area of vasogenic edema involving the
right frontal lobe appears similar as well. There is partial
opacification of the ethmoid sinuses, and a rounded hyperdense
structure containing air within the left side of the frontal
sinus
