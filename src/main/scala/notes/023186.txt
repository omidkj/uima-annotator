tests and the patient's coagulopathy was corrected and the
patient was discharged home with slight increase in liver
function tests and increased Hepatitis C viral load felt to
be responsible for increased liver function tests.  The
patient was doing very well until the morning of admission on

The patient was admitted to the Transplant Service, restarted
on his home meds and on hospital day one, Hepatology was
consulted and saw the patient and the patient was found to
have CVRNA of greater than 700,000 with an echocardiogram of
EF 35 to 40%  Preoperatively he was greater than 60%  The
patient had ultrasound to mark biopsy site.  The patient had
biopsy on hospital day one, which showed focal bile duct
proliferation with associated neutral, cannot exclude biliary
obstruction, lobular hepatocytes suggestive of early
recurrent Hepatitis C, minimal clostasis, no features of
acute cellular rejection.  At that time on [**2148-5-16**] the
patient continued to have recurrent epistaxis and a chest x-
ray that was concerning for volume overload.  The patient's
node was packed and the patient was started on Lasix at that
time.

Cardiology was consulted for shortness of breath, fever, or
congestive heart failure and electrocardiogram changes in
Leads 1, 2, AVL, V4 to V6 with biphasic V3 and they suggested
aggressive diuresis, increasing Imdur and Hydralazine with
addition of Lopressor.  Infectious Disease was also consulted
on patient for reactivation of Hepatitis C and inability to
tolerate p.o's and increased checking CMV levels, rapid viral
nasal washings, Legionella, fractioned bili, and cover with
Levofloxacin which was done.

The patient was admitted to SICU on [**2148-5-16**] for respiratory
distress, the patient was shortness of breath with labored
breathing and right chest tube was placed for significant
effusion at that time.  The patient was covered with
Fluconazole, Bactrim and Levaquin while in the unit.  Lasix
dose was decreased on hospital day 3, SICU day 2.  Pulmonary
was consulted.  Beta-blockade was restarted, Nitroglycerin
drip was stopped.  ID continued to see patient and because of
low filling pressures Lasix was held at that time.  The
patient had Pulmonary consult, bronchoscopy done showing
normal airways with sanguinous return from BAL and Lingula
and right middle lobe.  The patient was started on trophic
tube feeds on [**2148-5-19**].  The patient was noted to be in acute
renal failure by hospital day four, SICU day three.  Lasix
was held.  The patient remained intubated throughout [**5-21**], hospital day six, SICU day five and was attempted to
wean to extubate by SICU day five.  A Swan-Ganz was changed
and pulled a catheter by [**2148-5-21**].  The patient had liver
biopsy on SICU day six,  hospital day seven.  The patient was
extubated by [**2148-5-22**] and transferred to the floor on [**2148-5-22**]
with improved respiratory status by clinical examination and
chest x-ray.

Hematology was consulted for low platelet count which showed
no evidence of microangiopathy, hip was negative, platelets
continued to be stable.  OT/PT continued to see the patient
throughout hospital course.  The patient was confused with
some fevers.  Had a head CT that was negative on hospital day
11.  The patient was started on Linezolid p.o. twice a day
for bacteremia [**2148-5-30**].  Nutrition was still an issue by
[**2148-5-31**] as the patient only took in 260 calories with 8 grams
of protein.  The patient on [**2148-6-1**] again having altered
mental status and shaking chills with fevers and rigors had a
temperature T-max of 102.6, right IJ line was placed and the
patient was transferred to the Unit where chest x-ray showed
possible hospital acquired pneumonia.  The patient was in
unit for three days and was started back on Zosyn along with
Vancomycin, was transferred back to the floor on [**2148-6-2**],
hospital day 19.  The patient was continued on Vancomycin and
Zosyn.  Urine cultures were negative.  Sputum was
contaminant.  The patient was continued on antibiotics.
Hepatology continued to see patient and recommended
thoracentesis which ws done and was also negative.  C. Diff
was negative as well.  The patient had persistent right
pleural effusion.  Blood cultures were no growth from [**2148-6-5**].
The patient continued on tube feeds of ProMod 45 cc's an
hour.  ENT was consulted for the recurrent epistaxis and
recommended humidified air with Afrin.

On hospital day 28, vancomycin day 12, Zosyn day 8, the
patient started to improve but continued to have low grade
fevers at 100 and spiked to 101.4 on Vancomycin day 14, Zosyn
day 20.  Antibiotics were stopped at thi
