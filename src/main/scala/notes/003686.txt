Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 759**]
Chief Complaint:
Neck and left arm numbness and tingling

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cervical laminectomy and fusion, ACDF C3-6


History of Present Illness:
 Mr. [**Known lastname 1968**] is a 68 y/o male with hyperlipidemia, HTN, cervical
radiculopathy, who was admitted to the orthopedics service on
[**2124-6-20**] for a cervical laminectomy and C3-C6 anterior/posterior
fusion. He underwent the procedures successfully and was
recovering on the ortho service, when on [**6-26**] he had an episode
of hypotension with SBP's in the 60's and tachycardia with
confusion. This resolved spontaneously, work-up was initiated,
and his opiate dose was decreased. However, a similar episode of
hypotension occured again at approximately 10 pm on the same
day, resulting in a Code Blue, intubation for airway protection
and transfer to the tramua ICU on [**6-26**]. He was started on
vancomycin and zosyn and levophed. CXR was significant for
infiltrates. He underwent a bronchoscopy and BAL on [**2124-6-27**] and
was noted to have copious secretions in LUL and LLL. He had a
bump in his troponin on [**2124-6-27**] with peak to 0.37. He was
extubated successfully on [**2124-6-28**].
.
Of note, his course was complicated by a troponin leak from 0.04
to >0.39. Cardiology was consulted and felt that the patient
likely sustained an NSTEMI in the setting of his hypotension,
recommendation was for medical management.

CT neck and chest: Status post C3-6 laminectomy and anterior
cervical fusion with large low- attenuation fluid collection
anterior to this region with thin enhancing rim,
likely representing post-operative change; however, superimposed
infection
cannot be excluded. The fluid collection extends into the
superior
mediastinum at the thoracic inlet.
2. Multiple lymph nodes are noted in the neck, mediastinum, and
hila.
3. Air space opacity in the left upper lobe suggestive of
pneumonia.
Bilateral subsegmental atelectasis noted.
4. Left upper lobe 3-mm pulmonary nodule. Comparison with prior
imaging is
suggested if available to establish stability; otherwise,
follow-up imaging with Ct Chest to assess for stability in a few
months can be considered based on risk for thoracic malignancy.
5. Opacification of left maxillary sinus and air- fluid level in
the sphenoid sinus may relate to recent endotracheal tube
placement.
6. 1-cm enhancing soft tissue nodule in right axilla of
uncertain etiology; this may represent a node; however, clinical
correlation is recommended.

echo: The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal defect
is seen by 2D or color Doppler. The estimated right atrial
pressure is 0-10mmHg. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity
size and regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF
>55%) Transmitral Doppler and tissue velocity imaging are
consistent with Grade I (mild) LV diastolic dysfunction. There
is no ventricular septal defect. The aortic root is moderately
dilated at the sinus level. The ascending aorta is mildly
dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but
aortic stenosis is not present. Trace aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial
mitral regurgitation. The left ventricular inflow pattern
suggests impaired relaxation. There is borderline pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

CT head: No evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage. MRI with
diffusion-weighted images is a more sensitive evaluation for
acute
ischemia/infarct and for vascular detail.

lung scan, perfusion images only: Low likelihood ratio for
recent pulmonary embolism. Heterogeneous perfusion is compatible
with the pulmonary congestion.

intraoperative Cspine XR: Two intraoperative radiographs of the
cervical spine were obtained without a radiologist present.
These demonstrate localization of C5-C6 and subsequent anterior
spinal fusion. For additional details, please consult the
operative report.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 1968**] is a 68 yo M with PMH HTN, Hyperlipidemia who was
initially admitted to the service of Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] for an
anterior/posterior cervical decompresion and fusion C3-6.

#. Cspine sponylosis s/p anterior/posterior cervical
decompresion and fusion C3-6: He was consented for the procedure
and elected to proceed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 363**].  Please see operative
note for procedure in detail.  Post-operatively he was
administered antibiotics and pain medication.  He was afebrile
and his incisions were clean and dry.  His post op course was
complicated by the details below, however he was ultimately seen
by physical therapy, cleared for discharge to rehab, and should
wear brace when out of bed at all times until his follow up
appoitnment with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 363**] in one month.

#. Pneumonia: postoperatively, he became confused and
experienced hypotension.  A stat EKG was performed which was
unchanged from previous.  His confusion cleared and hypotension
resolved after a 500mL blous of fluid.  A second episode of
hypotension and difficulty breathing occurred and a code was
called.  He was subsequently intubated and transferred to the
T/SICU.  In the T/SICU he required pressors for his hypotension
and continuous mechanical ventilation.  An echo was performed
which was unchanged from that [**2120**].  V/Q Scan revealed a low
likelihood ratio for recent pulmonary embolism.  Neck and chest
CT showed a post-operative seroma without evidence of gas pocket
or infection.

Chest x-rays revealed a left lower lobe pneumonia and
vancomycin/zosyn were started.  A brochoscopy was performed and
revealed copious secretions in the LUL and LML which were
cultured.  He was subsequently extubated and transferred out of
the T/SICU and to the medical service.  Sputum cultures and BAL
cultures with pan-sensitive E. coli, Klebsiella and Enterobacter
all sensitive to ciprofloxacin so vancomycin and zosyn were
discontinued and ciprofloxacin was started to complete 10 day
course of antibiotics (last day [**2124-7-7**]).  Polymicrobial nature
