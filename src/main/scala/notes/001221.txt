headaches

History of Present Illness:
62 y/o M with hx of renal transplant and diagnosis of diffuse
Large B Cell Lymphoma s/p [**Hospital1 **] chmotherapy and recent
intrathecal chemotherapy presents with headache. pt has been
apparently getting worsening headache since 15th with some
photophobia and some confusion at times. no focal neurological
complaints. no fever/chill/rigor. no neck stiffness or
photophobia. no visual disturbances or nausea. pt subsequently
saw Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] on [**8-8**] and underwent MRI of brain for
evaluation. This apparently demonstrated extensive lesion in
both hemispheres but restricted to white matter only, he was
therefore referred to the ED for evaluation. In [**Name (NI) **] pt was seen
by neurology consult, onc consult and renal consult. his only
current complaint is mild headache which responded to po
tylenol. he underwent LP per neuro recommendation and is
admitted for further evaluations.
.
In the hospital pt was LP'd and had brain bx which confirmed B
lymphoma. He subsequently underwent high dose MTX therapy via
CVVH which completed. His course was complicated by enterococcus
UTI treated with amoxicillin and C. Diff treated with Flagyl. Of
note pt is on atovaqon for PCP prophylaxis and is getting
lekovorin for rescue. He was just switched from [**Last Name (un) **] to FK due
to falling counts. today he under went LUE uss for possible dvt
which was negative.

MRI OF THE HEAD WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRAST
CLINICAL INDICATION: 63-year-old man with history of CNS
lymphoma, status
post high dose of chemotherapy, now with worsening mental status
change, MRI to evaluate progression of CNS lymphoma.

COMPARISON: Multiple prior examinations of the head, the most
recent
consistent with CT of the head without contrast dated [**2185-8-25**] at 1034
hours, prior MRI of the head dated [**2185-8-12**] and [**2185-8-9**].

TECHNIQUE: Pre-contrast axial and sagittal T1-weighted images
were obtained,axial FLAIR, axial T2, axial magnetic
susceptibility and axial diffusion-weighted sequences. After the
administration of gadolinium contrast, the T1-weighted images
were repeated in axial T1, sagittal MP-RAGE and multiplanar
reconstructions.

FINDINGS: In comparison with the most recent MRI dated [**2185-8-10**], there is evidence of larger pattern of vasogenic edema,
involving the right temporal lobe, apparently extending at the
right parahippocampal formation (4:10), the pattern of abnormal
enhancement on the right temporal lobe lesion remains similar,
extending at the head of the caudate nucleus on the right. The
pattern of abnormal enhancement involving the left
occipitoparietal region remains stable with a new area of
enhancement tracking the biopsy site, post-surgical changes are
identified on the left parietal convexity consistent with a burr
hole. On the diffusion-weighted sequence, there is evidence of a
heterogeneous area of high signal at the head of the caudate
nucleus, which is not clearly identified on the corresponding
ADC map, however, the possibility of small areas with subacute
ischemia cannot be completely excluded (702:16). Normal flow
void signal is identified in the major vascular structures.
There are no new areas with abnormal enhancement. The area of
abnormal enhancement on the right temporal lobe measures
approximately 18.6 x 22.7 mm in size. The area of abnormal
enhancement on the head of the caudate nucleus measures
approximately 9.9 x 15.3 mm and the area of abnormal enhancement
on the left parietooccipital region measures approximately 32.8
x 32.5 mm in maximum dimensions. Persistent mucosal thickening
is identified on the left maxillary sinus, presumably a small
mucous retention cyst.

IMPRESSION: Larger area of vasogenic edema and effacement of the
sulci
involving the right temporal lobe as described above, apparently
extending at the right hippocampal formation, no definite uncal
herniation is identified, the perimesencephalic cisterns are
patent. The pattern of enhancement in the different lesions
located at the right temporal lobe, right head of the caudate
nucleus and left parietooccipital regions remain stable with
similar pattern of enhancement and vasogenic edema, new track of
abnormal enhancement is identified in the surgical site with
associated surgical changes consistent with a left parietal burr
hole. Questionable area of restricted diffusion identified on
the diffusion-weighted sequence of the head of the caudate
nucleus (702:16), which is not clearly identified on the
corresponding ADC map, however, ischemic changes cannot be
completely excluded, please correlate clinically.

Brief Hospital Course:
63-year-old male with DM-II, HTN, CAD, CKD, non-Hodgkin B-cell
lymphoma s/p chemotherapy (no radiation therapy),  s/p kidney
transplant (on Rapamune & Prednisone) who presented with
worsening HTN urgency and 2 weeks of throbbing headaches and
found to have extensive bihemispheric white matter lesions on
MRI (R temporal and L parieto-occipital).
.
#HEME/Oncology: The patient was diagnosed with B-cell lymphoma
diagnosed [**1-/2185**] and is s/p 6 cycles of chemotherapy (R-[**Hospital1 **]
x5, R-CHOP x1) and 2 cycles of IT ara-C with last dose given on
[**2185-7-13**] per OMR. The had an LP and imaging which showed
significant mets to the brain. He was treated with methotrexate.
The patient also recieved leucovorin, bicarb and CVVHD to aid in
renal protection. The patient developed an acutely worsening
mental status. He was given steroids and had repeat imaging
which showed worsening of mets in increased brain edema. The
decision was made to start whole brain radiation as treatment.
After two t
