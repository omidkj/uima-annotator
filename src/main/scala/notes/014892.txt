CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Abnormal electrocardiogram.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 61 year old diabetic
male who reported in passing that the patient noticed
exertional left-sided heartburn symptoms associated with mild
shortness of breath.  The patient stated it could occur after
walking for ten minutes while pushing his grandson in the

depression inferiorly in V4 to V6.  There is ............
into recovery.  The echocardiogram showed that there is
ejection fraction of 65 to 70% with 1+ aortic insufficiency
and trivial mitral regurgitation with exercise.  There was
new hypokinesis in the distal septum and apex.

orthopnea, edema, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea and
lightheadedness.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is divorced and lives with his
daughter.  The patient works in sales.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the Cardiology
Service.  The patient underwent cardiac catheterization which
showed that the patient had a 90% occlusion in the left
anterior descending, 90% in the mid circumflex and 90% in the
distal right coronary artery.  With this in mind, the patient
underwent echocardiogram which results are as stated
previously.  The patient underwent a four vessel, saphenous
vein graft to left anterior descending, saphenous vein graft
to obtuse marginal, saphenous vein graft to PL to posterior
descending artery on [**2138-3-12**].  The patient in the
Operating Room had stable atrial fibrillation which was
treated with an Amiodarone bolus and he cardioverted times
two.  The patient on admission to Cardiac Surgery Recovery
Unit was off of Propofol and had stable cardiovascular signs.
The patient was continued to be intubated.

In terms of the patient's kidneys the patient produced brisk
urine output.  Potassium was repleted.  The patient was
afebrile and was continued on Vancomycin perioperatively.
The patient was kept NPO and was given Ranitidine and
Carafate with insulin drip and the patient overall was
improving.  On postoperative day #1, the patient was
extubated and had decreased pressure support, the patient was
on Neo 1.5 and continued on insulin drip.  The patient's
Intensive Care Unit stay was complicated by need for
reintubation for unknown cause.  The patient developed
respiratory distress.  The patient was intubated without any
difficulty and required some pressure support.  During this
stay the patient had no evidence of pneumonia or heart
failure.  The patient was continued to be intubated until the
patient was successfully extubated on postoperative day #3.
Otherwise the patient's pain was well controlled throughout
the stay.

In the Intensive Care Unit the patient was continued on
Amiodarone.  The patient was initially atrial paced in the
Intensive Care Unit and then the patient was subsequently put
on Dopamine which was weaned off.  The patient's blood sugar
was continued to be monitored and treated using sliding scale
and the patient was on Reglan and kept NPO while he was
intubated.  Afterwards the patient's diet was advanced.  The
patient has a poor appetite.  On postoperative day #6, the
patient was transferred to the floor.  On postoperative day
#7 the patient complained of some sore throat.  The patient
was afebrile with stable vital signs.  The patient took in
good p.o. and made good urine.

The patient's wires were removed, the ........... was stopped
and the patient was started on Captopril and Levofloxacin was
stopped which was treatment for presumed infiltrate.
Physical therapy continued to work with the patient.  On
postoperative day #8 the patient complained of some cough and
continued sore throat.  The patient remained febrile with
stable vital signs, taking in good p.o. and with good urine
output.  Blood pressure was somewhat elevated, thus the
patient's Lopressor was increased and chest x-ray was
obtained which showed a left lower lobe atelectasis.  The
patient also was complaining of difficulty swallowing.  We
obtained a bedside swallow evaluation.  The initial
impression was that the patient may be aspirating thin
liquids.  The patient was kept NPO, per recommendation to use
thick liquids and medications with nectar for the night and
to obtain a video swallow the next day and also obtain an
Otorhinolaryngology consult.

On postoperative day #9, the patient continued to remain
afebrile with stable vital signs.  We obtained a video
swallow which showed that the patient was not aspirating and
thus the patient was put on a regular diet.
Otorhinolaryngology consult revealed that the patient had
[**Female First Name (un) 564**] esophagitis.  The patient was put on Fluconazole and
the patient's Metoprolol was increased to 75 b.i.d. for a
pressure of 170s/60s.  On postoperative day #9, the patient
spiked a temperature up to 101.3.  The patient was
pancultured, obtained urine culture and urinalysis which was
negative.  Sputum gram stain revealed oropharyngeal Flora
organisms.  Chest x-ray revealed an atelectasis of the left
lower lobe.  Complete blood count revealed that the patient
had a white count of 19.1.  The patient had a slight drainage
from the sternal wound.  The patient was put on Ancef 1 gm q.
8 and to do Betadine and sterile dressing changes to the
site.

The patient, on postoperative day #11, had improvement in his
Foley catheter improved.  He had a low-grade temperature of
100.1 with stable vital signs.  One of the three bottles grew
out gram positive cocci.  The patient was put on Vancomycin
and Levofloxacin and Ancef was stopped.  The patient's
Lopressor was also increased to 100 mg t.i.d. for the blood
pressure of 150s/70s.  On postoperative day #12, the patient
had a low-grade temperature of 100.1, otherwise stable vital
signs.  Blood pressure was better controlled.  The patient
was continued on antibiotics.  The patient's white count was
decreased to 13.8 and the sputum grew out gram positive cocci
and gram negative rods as well as the oropharyngeal
organisms.

On postoperative day #13 the patient remained afebrile with
stable vital signs.  Blood pressure was under better control,
and the patient's white count had been stable.  The patient
was discharged to rehabilitation in stable condition.
