Studies:
CXR [**2135-1-11**]: report cut off.
ECG: a flutter at 92bpm.
.
CXR [**2135-1-16**]: New opacities in the right lower lobe and right
upper lobe. This may either represent evolving pneumonia or
aspiration. Findings communicated to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 349**].
.
CXR [**2135-1-19**]: No evidence for pneumonia.

Brief Hospital Course:
(For further details of ICU admission, please see addendum to be
completed by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **])

73 yo male resident of [**Hospital3 **] with h/o VRE and MRSA
bacteremia, osteomyelitis, CAD s/p CABG, hypertension, and
recent trach placement admitted [**2136-1-11**] to ICU with asymptomatic
aflutter and lethargy. He was placed on dilt gtt for rate
control, and received a dose of unasyn (recent urine culture
with acinetobacter sensitive to unasyn), linezolid (recent VRE
bacteremia), and PO Flagyl for a recent C diff infection.
Patient was given fluid, including PRBC x 2 units with
appropriate improvement in Hct.  He was also noted to have had
an elevated INR, which did not improve with Vit K, so today he
was given a unit of FFP. He improved clinically, Abx were scaled
back, and currently on cipro and flagyl, afebrile and with
improved WBC count.  Pt was in paroxysmal Aflutter, which was
adequately rate controlled on PO meds.  He was called out to the
floor.
.
The patient was recently admitted for a month, during which time
he was treated for VRE line infection with 14 days of linezolid,
as well as 5 days of zosyn for acintobacter UTI.  He was
intubated for hypoxic respiratory distress, and was unable to be
extubated, and was trach'd.  He was also noted to have been in
and out of aflutter during that admission, which prompted
starting digoxin for added rate control.

On the floor, he was noted to have episodes of atrial flutter
into the 120s.  His beta blocker was increased, and
consideration was made for cardioversion or ablation; EP was
curbsided and said that the patient would be a poor candidate
for amiodarone or DCCV.  His metoprolol was increased and his
rate was better controlled in the 80s.

On [**1-15**], he developed a fever to 102.  Urine and blood were sent
for cultures, and he was started empirically on linezolid for
possible UTI given his history of VRE.  Urine cultures grew out
Ecoli sensitive to ciprofloxacin and VRE sensitive to Linezolid.
Blood cultures remained NGTD. Stool cultures confirmed the
diagnosis of CDiff. Initial CXR had no evidence of pna. Repeat
CXR showed patchy area of aspiration vs. pna. A CXR a few days
later, did not have any infiltrates. Pt was continued on flagyl
for treatment of Cdiff. Pt was given linezolid and cipro for
treatment of UTI. Of note, pt was also noted to have some
scrotal erythema and edema, first noted on [**1-14**], which did not
appear progress. Linezolid would cover cellulitis as well.  His
foley catheter was removed and he had a condom cath placed.
Pt had intermittent episodes of fever and elevated WBC, while on
Linezolid, Flagyl, and Cipro. Repeat urine and blood cultures
were negative. Pt remained afebrile for several days with a
decreasing WBC count prior to discharge.
