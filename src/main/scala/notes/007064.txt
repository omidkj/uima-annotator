Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1505**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
-[**10-8**] Cardiac catheterization
-[**10-13**] Coronary artery bypass grafting x3 (Left internal mammary
to the Left anterior descending artery, Saphenous vein graft
(SVG)->Obtuse marginal artery, SVG->Posterior desceding artery.)



History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 60yo woman with h/o hypertension, hyperlipidemia,
type 2 diabetes, fibromyalgia and CAD s/p BMS to the left Cx in
[**2130-7-22**]. In [**2132-5-21**], she got repeat catheterization after
c/o daily episodes of chest discomfort; angiography revealed a
30% proximal RCA, 40% proximal LAD, 90% mid LAD, 60% D2 and an
80% proximal Cx. The LAD and Cx were treated with bare metal
stents.
.
She has felt well for several months following her procedure in
[**5-31**] but then developed a recurrence of chest discomfort. The
discomfort is a dull substernal pain, She describes having from
one to three episodes per day, occurring both at rest and with
exertion.  SL nitroglycerin is effective in treating her
discomfort. She has not had stress testing since her last PCI
and is now referred for relook catheterization with possible
surgical revascularization.

Denies LE edema, orthopnea, PND, lightheadedness, dizziness,
claudication. + Increase in dyspnea with exertion or when
bending over. Slight improvement in SOB after being prescribed
lasix 20mg qd about 3months ago. Denies BRBPR, hematuria.

MICROBIOLOGY:
-[**2132-10-8**] 12:29 pm URINE     Site: CLEAN CATCH      CATH LAB.

                            **FINAL REPORT [**2132-10-9**]**

   URINE CULTURE (Final [**2132-10-9**]):    <10,000 organisms/ml.

.
IMAGING:
-[**10-8**] Cardiac cath: FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. CT surgical evaluation for possible CABG.
3. Admit patient for revascularization during this admission
given the
rest anginal symptoms.
.
-[**10-9**] Echo: The left atrium is elongated. Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are
normal (LVEF >55%). There is no ventricular septal defect. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are
normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but
aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no
mitral valve prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The
estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is
no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Normal global and regional biventricular systolic
function. No pulmonary hypertension or clinically-significant
valvular disease seen.
.
-[**10-9**] CXR: IMPRESSION:
1. Focal opacity overlying thoracic vertebra on lateral view
likely
represents degenerative changes. However, recommend left and
right lateral
oblique views to rule out lung nodule.

2. Small left mid lung linear atelectasis. Otherwise, no acute
cardiopulmonary process.
.
-[**10-9**] CAROTID SERIES COMPLETE: IMPRESSION: No evidence of
carotid artery stenosis bilaterally.
.
-[**10-11**] CXR obliques: IMPRESSION: Routine frontal and a shallow
lateral oblique were performed to evaluate questionable lung
nodule projecting over the lower thoracic spine on conventional
radiographs taken [**2132-10-9**]. The opacity is due to
degenerative spinal osteophyte not lung nodule.
.
[**2132-10-13**] ECHO
PRE-BYPASS:
The left atrium is dilated. No spontaneous echo contrast or
thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium/left atrial
appendage or the body of the right atrium/right atrial
appendage. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and
regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%).
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
There are focal calcifications in the aortic arch. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral
regurgitation.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in person of the results before
surgical incision

POST-BYPASS:
Preserved biventricular systolic function.
LVEF 55%.
Intact thoracic aorta.
No new valvular lesions.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2132-10-8**] where she
underwent a cardiac catheterization. This revealed severe three
vessel disease and the cardiac surgical service was consulted.
She was worked-up in the usual preoperative manner. A carotid
ultrasound showed no evidence of carotid artery stenosis
bilaterally. Spirometry testing was performed which was  normal.
The neurology service was consulted given her history of stroke
and cerebral bleed. She was cleared from a neuological
perspective. Plavix was allowed to washout over a few days. On
[**2132-10-13**], Mrs. [**Known lastname **] was taken to the operating room where she
underwent coronary artery bypass grafting to three vessels.
Please see operative note for details. postoperatively she was
trnasferred to the intensive care unit for monitoring. Over the
next 24 hours, she awoke neurologically intact and was
extubated. She was transferred to the floor on POD #2 to begin
