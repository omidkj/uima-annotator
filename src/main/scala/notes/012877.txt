Service: NEUROLOGY

Allergies:
Penicillins / Sulfonamides

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 6075**]
Chief Complaint:
Consulted by Neurosurgery for cerebellar hemorrhage


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **] year old hx of Afib (on Coumadin), HTN, CHF, and hx of falls
who presented yesterday with headache, nausea and vomiting
(symptoms acutely developed at 5PM yesterday).

She is unable to provide a history, but notes indicate that she
was at home with her home health aide when she developed a
sudden
headache and began vomiting.  There was no hx of recent trauma.
She was taken to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED where a head CT revealed a
cerebellar hemorrhage.  Vitals in the ED were [**Telephone/Fax (2) 96258**]% on
RA.  Her INR was 3.3.  She was given factor IX cmplx in ED and
Vit K.

She was admitted to neurosurgical ICU.  She remained on
Labetalol
gtt for BP control until this morning at 10AM.  Her neurologic
exam has remained stable and, as of this morning, was noted to
have some confusion, left sided dysmetria, left lateral gaze
palsy (left eye did not move past midline, right eye unable to
fully adduct).  [**Name8 (MD) **] RN, she has been easily arousable and awake
for most of the day and evening.  She was given hydralazine for
elevated BP and shortly thereafter complained of dizziness and
nausea.  She received Anzemet and Compazine with some relief and
has become less restless later in the evening.

Currently, she is difficult to arouse and complains of
"dizziness" and "feeling sleepy".  She answers some questions
appropriately, but is unable to relay a history.

Neurologic examination:
Mental status: Sleeping, requires vigorous stimulation to

She eventually does arouse, but keeps eyes closed through exam.
She is oriented to person, "nursing home", but able to name
"[**Hospital3 **] Hospital", "[**2067**]".  Falls back to sleep requiring
repeated
stimulation to maintain wakefullness.  Speech is fluent, does
not
cooperate with naming or repitition tasks.  Follows one step
midline and appendicular commands (inconsistently).
Cranial Nerves:
Pupils equally round and reactive to light, 3 to 2 mm
bilaterally. +blink to threat bilaterally.  Able to count
fingers. Extraocular movements difficult to assess as pt keeps
eyes closed for much of exam.  Right eye slightly laterally
deviated.  Right lateral gaze intact, pt does not look left
(unable vs cooperation?).  Sensation intact to nasal tickle
bilaterally.  Facial movement symmetric.
Tongue midline.  +gag
 .
Motor:
Tone normal. No observed myoclonus or +postural tremor of UE
bilaterally.  Lifts all extremities antigravity for at least 5
seconds, no obvious asymmetries
.

.
Reflexes:
+2 and symmetric throughout, except absent at ankles.
Toes withdrew bilaterally
 .

IMAGING
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2128-12-18**] 5:59 PM
FINDINGS: There is interval development of a large left
cerebellar intraparenchymal hemorrhage. There is possible
extension into the fourth ventricle. The lateral and third
ventricles are not dilated and stable in size compared to the
previous exam. Multiple small areas of hypodensity near the
caudate lobes bilaterally, and left subinsular regions are
stable. Basal cisterns are patent.
Bone windows reveal no suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions.
The visualized portions of the paranasal sinuses are well
aerated.
IMPRESSION: Interval development of large left cerebellar acute
hemorrhage with possible extension into the fourth ventricle.
CT [**12-18**]:
Large left cerebellar intraparenchymal hemorrhage.  There is
possible extension into the fourth ventricle.  The lateral and
third ventricles are not dilated and stable in size compared to
the previous exam.  Multiple small areas of hypodensity near the
caudate lobes bilaterally.
.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2128-12-19**] 10:26 AM
FINDINGS: Again seen is a large left cerebellar hemorrhage which
extends into the fourth ventricle, and is essentially unchanged
compared to one day earlier. Please note the study is limited
due to patient motion artifact. The ventricles are stable in
size with no hydrocephalus. No new hemorrhage is identified.
Hypodensities are again seen within the periventricular white
matter, as well as a focal hypodensity in the left basal
ganglion consistent with a lacunar infarct. There have been no
other changes.
IMPRESSION:
Stable appearance of left cerebellar hemorrhage extending into
the fourth ventricle. No hydrocephalus.


Brief Hospital Course:
The patient is [**Age over 90 **] year old woman with a history of multiple
falls, HTN, valvular heart disease, Afibb, on coumadin, who
presented after caretaker noticed her to be more sleepy than
baseline. She also had an episode sudden headache and vomiting.
There have been no witnessed falls. A head CT showed a large L
cerebellar acute hemorrhage, with blood in the 4th ventricle,
and mild mass effect on pons. She was admitted to the SICU and
followed by the Neurosurgery service until she was transferred
to the floor [**12-20**].
.
Her INR was upon admission was 3.3 and she was given Factor IX
concentrate in ED, as well as Vit K. The etiology of her
hemorrhage is likely to be due to hypertension though
hemorrhagic conversion of ischemic stroke, unwitnessed trauma,
bleed into underlying mass, or amyloid (usually cortically
based) are also possible.
A follow up CT [**12-19**] showed a stable picture. Her exam improved.
On [**12-21**] she was able hold a converstation, to move all
extremities antigravity. She had decreased tone in her L-arm and
leg, as well as ataxia. Both toes were upgoing.
Her coags were followed (INR<1.3, plts>100). INR 1.2 on [**12-21**].
ASA 81mg was started [**12-23**].
.
Endo:
The patient's blood sugars were regulated with a ISS based on
FSBS.
.
CV:
Her hypertension was initially managed with hydralazine and
labetolol iv PRN in the ICU. Once she was able to take PO
medications she was started on a PO regimen of metoprolol 75mg
TID, diltiazem 60mg QID and lisinopril 10mg PO daily. Cardiology
was consulted for adjustments, especially to help control her
multifocal atrial tachycardia. Diltiazem should be titrated
down. Lopressor should be maintained. If her heart rate
continues to be above 90, lopressor may be increased. If her
heart rate is well controle
