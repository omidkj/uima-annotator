History of Present Illness:
73 y/o female w/difficulty sleeping due to chest/jaw pain,

Physical Exam:
RLE cool, pulseless, otherwise exam was unremarkable

Brief Hospital Course:
Taken emergently to the operating room on [**2165-8-26**] for repair of
ascending aortic dissection.
Post-op, she was transferred to the CSRU. On POD # 1, she moved
all 4 extrremities, but started to become hypotensive with
waking, she was placed on Neo gtt, she went into AFib, and was
started on Amiodarone.  Diuresis was started.
She had some more problems with AFib, which caused decreased BP
and SVO2.  She was cardioverted, and remained on Amiodarone gtt.
 TEE on [**2165-8-28**] revealed EF 30-35%, depressed bivent. fxn.
Dobutamine was started on [**8-29**] due to worsening cardiac output.
Oxygenation worsened, as did her cardiac status. A cardiology
consult was obtained on [**2165-8-31**].  Echo was essentially unchanged
from TEE done earlier in the week.  She had a sudden drop in BP
and SVO2 around 9:40 pm ([**2165-8-31**]), Neo-Synephrine gtt started,
BP stabilized briefly.  Had significant ST elevations in
anterolateral leads ~ 10:30 pm.  Echo revealed EF 20-25%,
anterior and anteroseptal akinesis (sub-optimal views due to
body habitus).  She was taken urgently to the cath lab, angio
revealed significant distal LM lesion, and totally occluded
proximal LAD.  Two stents were placed (distal LM & LAD), and the
patient was transported back to the CSRU.  She remained stable
for approx. 1 hour, when she again precipitously dropped her BP.
 She proceeded to cardiac arrest at 3:27 am.  ACLS protocol was
initiated.  She did not respond to resuscitative efforts, and
was pronounced at 4:09 am.
