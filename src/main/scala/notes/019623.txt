fall, altered mental status

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:

History of Present Illness:
History obtained from chart and daughter. Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a [**Age over 90 **] yo
F with CKD, diabetes, HTN, atrial thrombus on coumadin who
presented on [**5-26**] with altered mental status since [**5-25**].
According to the daughter, she noticed that the patient was
acting stangely, mumbling words and referencing things that were
not there. She supposedly had a bad dream, fell, and hit her
head on the bed post. She had been more weak recently, requiring
more help with her ADLs. She is not normal at baseline. At that
time, she denied chest pain, SOB, HA, dizziness, abdominal pain,
but had mild pain in her shoulders. She was recently diagnosed
with spinal stenosis and had been undergoing PT/OT. Per the
daughter, patient recently started tramadol on [**5-19**].
.
In the ED, BP 174/134, HR 77, Rr 22, 98%RA. CT head and C spine
without bleed or fx. CXR unremarkable. She was admitted to the
floor for further work up.
.
On the floor, she became agitated and tried to get out of bed
mult times. She was given zyprexa 5mg x1. During the course of
the day she became increasingly more somnolent, not arousable to
stimuli. Her exam was otherwise non-focal. AVSS with pt 97%RA.
ABG 7.28/79/101/39. Pt was placed on BiPAP with little clinical
improvement. Repeat ABG 7.37/66/59. Pt was transferred to the
MICU for further care.

Radiographic studies:
CT cspine (wet read): No fracture or malalignment. no
prevertebral soft tissue swelling. Multilevel degeneratvie
change with posterior osteophytes causing mild central canal
stenosis.

CT head: diffuse parenchymal atrophy and small [**Last Name (un) 12599**] ischemic
disease, unchanged. no acute intracranial process. soft tissue

recommended.

CXR: No acute processes

CT Chest: IMPRESSION: Limited interpretation due to near
expiratory state and motion artifact. No evidence of acute
pulmonary or mediastinal disease. Bilateral dorsal areas of
atelectasis, accompanied by volume loss. No acute infection or

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a [**Age over 90 **] YO F with h/o atrial thrombus on coumadin,
HTN, CKD, admitted with altered mental status after a fall with
acute decompensation on the floor, transferred to the MICU.
.
Altered Mental Status: Likely multifactorial to unclude
medications (Tramadol recently started) in addition to sedating
medications in a patient with baseline hypercarbia and dementia.
 There was no evidence on CT scan to suggest ICH and no exam
findings to suggest stroke.  There was no evidence of infection.
 Sedating medications were held including tramadol and
gabapentin.  She was treated on BIPAP given hypercarbic
respiratory failure.  With this treatment her CO2 improved and
her mental status gradually returned to baseline.  Geriatrics
consult was called for recommendations regarding polypharmacy as
well as treatment of agitation.  Geriatrics was consulted and
had the following specific recommendations which we followed:
- avoid anti-psychotics/sedating meds given hypercarbia
associated with single dose of Zyprexa
- if severely agitated, would recommend 1:1 sitter instead of
meds
- would avoid tramadol and other narcotics if possible
- would increase bowel regimen to ensure BMs daily
- would consider lidoderm patch for back pain
.
In addition, the geriatric team had the following general
recommendations for non-pharmacologic delirium prevention which
we think would be helpful for Ms [**Known lastname **] in her ongoing care:
1) Remove all lines and catheters as soon as possible, esp Foley

2) Avoid sedatives, especially antihistamines and
benzodiazepines
3) Encourage family to be at bedside, with familiar home objects

4) Explore and encourage baseline religious/spiritual coping
mechanisms for illness.
5) Pr
