CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Decreased p.o. intake, hypoxia and
arrhythmia.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 77 year old female
with a complex past medical history including nonsmall cell
lung cancer, status post right middle lobe and right lower
lobe resection, post debulking and recurrent pseudomonas
pneumonia, right lung pseudomonas abscess and chronic
respiratory failure, status post tracheostomy.  The patient
has been at [**Hospital1 1319**] for three months and was referred after
two days of decreased p.o. intake and decreased baseline
oxygen saturations, went from FIO2 of 20% to 35% and question
of brady-arrhythmia with junctional rhythm and need for
temporary pacemaker placement.  Recent history is significant
for pseudomonas pneumonia about five weeks ago, treated with
three antibiotics, Gentamicin, Vancomycin and another
antibiotic which is not clear.  This was complicated by
Clostridium c difficile infection as well as acute renal
failure with creatinine of 3.2.  Her pneumonia resolved,
Clostridium difficile was refractory to Flagyl and changed to
p.o. Vancomycin.  The patient was maintained on tracheostomy
mask, weaning trial since three weeks, baseline settings,
pressure support of 12 and 5, FIO2 .21, respiratory rate 14
and title volumes of 360 to 500.  The patient tolerated this
quite well and went from 1 to 2 hours to six hours in the
past week on tracheostomy mask.  During weaning trial a
question on prophylactic antibiotics, this week also with
urinary tract infection but interim antibiotics.  Also
started Prednisone for pseudogout.  Per the daughter, patient
this week with increased lethargy, decreased p.o. intake,
bilious emesis, and a headache.  The patient also had
intermittent chest tightness and dyspnea.  On the day of
admission the patient was having her usual six hour weaning
trial and desated to 88% on FIO2 of 21% and then increased to
100% on .35 FIO2.  Heartrate decreased to the 40s and there
was a question of a junctional rhythm.  Hence, the patient
was referred to [**Hospital6 256**].  At the
[**Hospital6 256**] the patient's high blood
pressure was 15/72, pulse 69, temperature 97.9, she was
sating at 100% with an FIO2 of 0.5%, arterial blood gases of
7.38, 50 and 322.  She was given Ativan 1 mg times one and
Morphine Sulfate.  In Medicine Intensive Care Unit the
patient was maintained on pressure support of 15 and 5 FIO2,
0.4 and had a volume of 450.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease, nonsmall cell lung cancer, status post
right middle lobe and right lower lobe resection, history of
melanoma in the past.  The patient's pathology of the
nonsmall cell lung cancer, consistent with adenomatous
features.  Lymph nods were all negative.  History of
recurrent pneumonia including pseudomonas.  History of
respiratory failure and chronic tracheostomy.  Multiple right
lung pseudomonas abscesses, status post multiple chest tube
drains, multiple rib resections, perioperative atrial
fibrillation resolved in Amiodarone, chronic asthmatic
bronchitis, hypertension, diverticulitis status post sigmoid
resection in [**2092**], history of BCA, patient is status post
radiation therapy as well as chemotherapy, status post
bilateral axillary node dissection in [**2116**] and [**2118**], severe
osteoarthritis.  Status post cholecystectomy, appendectomy,
total abdominal hysterectomy, history of anxiety and
depression, functional dependency, history of urinary tract
infection and urosepsis and melanoma.  History of pseudogout
and Methicillin-sensitive resistant Staphylococcus aureus.

ALLERGIES:  Levaquin causes a rash, Bactrim causes a rash,
Codeine causes nausea and intravenous dye as well as
shellfish.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  No ethyl alcohol, no intravenous drug use,
positive tobacco use for 60 years, quit in [**2113**].  Married.
Has lived in the [**Location (un) 3844**] area.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Significant for coronary artery disease,
hypertension, diabetes, cancer and hemochromatosis.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  In the Emergency Room the patient was
generally ill-appearing, sedated but appeared comfortable.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat, pupils equal, round and
reactive to light.  Oropharynx was clear, moist mucous
membranes.  Chest, left lung clear to auscultation.  Right
distant rhoncherous breathsounds.  Chest wall after rib
resection, site is clean dry and intact with no drainage.
Cardiovascular, regular rate and rhythm, normal S1, normal
S2, no murmurs.  Abdomen is soft, normoactive bowel sounds,
nontender, nondistended.  Extremities, PICC line site is
clean, dry and intact in the left upper extremity.  There is
no cyanosis, clubbing or edema.  1+ pedal edema bilaterally.
Neurological, alert and oriented times three.  The patient
was too sedated to comply with neurological examination but
moved all extremities spontaneously.  Skin:  Right upper
chest wound, no erythema, no drainage.

LABORATORY DATA:  The patient's data revealed white count
22.1, hematocrit 30.4, platelet count 672, neutrophils 88,
lymphocytes 5.4, monocytes 5.8, eosinophils 0.6.  Arterial
blood gases 7.3, 850 and 229.  Sodium 136, potassium 4.6,
chloride 98, bicarbonate 25, BUN 24, creatinine 1.9, glucose
138.  Creatinine kinase is 187, troponin 0.04, ALT 63, AST
29, LD is 214, albumin 4.1, alkaline phosphatase 178, total
bilirubin 0.2, amylase 26, lipase 15.  Chest x-ray, post
surgical changes in the right upper lobe area, status post
right lower lobe and right middle lobe resection and
mediastinal shift.  No pneumothorax.  Questionable of
interstitial markings increased bilaterally.  Positive right
small effusion, no infiltrates.  Electrocardiogram, normal
sinus rhythm at 68 beats/minute normal axis.  Early
repolarization.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was maintained on FiO2 of 0.40 and
positive end-expiratory pressure of 5 and pressure support of 12.
On the second day the patient was on her baseline of
0.21% FIO2 sating very well on this. Otherwise the patient was
maintained on Albuterol, Atrovent, Flovent, Salmeterol with
good response.

Cardiac - Throughout her admission in the hospital, the pt
remained in normal sinus rhythm.  She ruled out for an
myocardial infarction.  A repeat electrocardiogram revealed
the patient was in sinus rhythm.  Otherwise an
electrophysiology consult was obtained and the
electrophysiology cardiology team felt that pacemaker
placement was currently not indicated as the patient was in
sinus rhythm with no evidence of syncope, hypertension or
other symptoms.

Infectious disease - The patient has a history of recurrent
pseudomonas pneumonia, Clostridium difficile,
Methicillin-sensitive resistant Staphylococcus aureus and
urinary tract infection.  Her count was elevated on admission
but then normalized to 14 on the second day.  It was felt
most likely secondary to steroid response as there was no
other systemic signs of infection.  The patient was
pancultured with blood cultures, sputum cultures, urine
cultures and a repeat chest x-ray was also performed which
revealed interval improvement of her prior chest examination.
The patient was maintained on aspiration precautions.  On day
#2, the sputum gram stain revealed gram negative rods and
final sputum culture was pending.  This was probably
consistent with colonization for pseudomonas.

Renal insufficiency - Acute
