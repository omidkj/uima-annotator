Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 56114**]
Chief Complaint:
hypotension

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
53F with a history of gastric bypass and metastatic
carcinosarcoma of the uterus s/p chemotherapy with [**Doctor Last Name **]/taxol,
most recent treatment six weeks ago, who presented to [**Hospital1 **] about one month ago and was diagnosed with spontaneous
splenic rupture. She is now s/p exploratory laparotomy and
splenectomy. She was reviewing the pathology slides today with
her oncologist in clinic and was told that there was evidence of
metastatic disease in the spleen. They checked her blood
pressure and noted systolics in the 80's so transported her to
the [**Hospital1 18**] ED. In the ED she complained of mild LUQ pain. FAST
was performed and noted to be positive so surgery was consulted.

Past Medical History:
ONCOLOGIC HISTORY:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 6607**] is a 53-year-old woman who noted some vaginal
discharge and followed up with her gynecologist when the
discharge became bloody. She underwent endometrial biopsy, which

revealed high-grade malignant tumor concerning for
carcinosarcoma
and a pelvic ultrasound revealing an echogenic area within the
cavity measuring 4 x 4 x 4 cm. She was referred to Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **].
-- On [**2135-8-22**], she underwent robotic assisted total
laparoscopic hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy,
bilateral pelvic and paraaortic lymph node dissection and
washing. Pathology revealed carcinosarcoma (malignant mixed
Mullerian tumor) and cervix with squamous metaplasia. Tumor 5.5
x 3.5 x 2.5 cm grade 3. Cytology of washings negative. PT1a
(Stage IA) 10% myometrial invasion, cervix negative, ovaries and

fallopian tubes negative, tN0, 0 out of 9 pelvic lymph nodes,
and 0 out of 4 paraaortic lymph nodes positive for metastasis.
No definitive foci of lymphovascular invasion identified.
- On [**2135-9-5**], started carboplatin AUC 5 and Taxol 175 for Cycle
1 which was complicated by Taxol-associated myalgias and
orthostatic hypotension (brief hospitalization, without LOC).
- On [**2135-9-23**] Seen by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] regarding vaginal spotting,
thought to be secondary to healing at suture site.
- On [**2135-9-26**], continued [**Doctor Last Name **] AUC 5 and decrease Taxol to
150mg/m2 for cycle 2 for C1D15, ANC 730
- On [**2135-11-14**] received cycle 3 [**Doctor Last Name **] 4 and Taxol to 135mg/m2
with neulasta on day 3 after deferred 4 week due to persistent
neutropenia
- [**2135-12-12**] C4D1 Taxol/[**Doctor Last Name **]
- [**2136-1-16**] C5D1 [**Doctor Last Name **]/Taxol

Past Medical History: Hypertension, Osteoarthritis, history of
urate and calcium stones, status post multiple lithotripsy,
Thyroid cancer in [**2122**] with recurrence status post radical
neck dissection (Of note, she had an MSSA surgical wound
infection in the setting of her radical neck dissection) and
complicated by thoracic duct injury status post clip
placement, [**7-15**] negative colonoscopy (history of polypectomy in
[**2131**]).

Past Surgical History: Gastric bypass in [**2125**] at [**Hospital3 **]
with 135-pound weight loss (a 40-pound weight gain since
menopause), thyroidectomy ([**Hospital1 1774**]), radical neck dissection for
recurrent disease ([**Hospital1 1774**]), left total knee replacement in [**2130**]
complicated by bacteremia and joint infection with recurrence
after six weeks of antibiotics resulting in spacer placement and
replacement of the joint again in [**2132**], tonsillectomy at age 5,
carpal tunnel bilaterally in [**2122**], cholecystectomy, umbilical
hernia repair

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 6607**] is a 53yo woman with a history of metastatic uterine
carcinosarcoma who was admitted from the emergency room to the
ICU for hypotension secondary to hemorrhage into splenectomy bed
lesion. She was then transferred to the gynecologic oncology
service on hospital day 2. She was discharged on home hospice on
hospital day 10. Her hospital course was as follows:

# Code status: Ms. [**Known lastname 6607**] was initially full code and all the
measures below were taken. However after two family meetings,
her daughter, [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) 1169**] was named as her healthcare proxy
and her code status was changed to comfort measures only on
[**2136-3-8**]. She was evaluated by hospice and admitted into
inpatient hospice. It was decided that she would be receive a
fentanyl patch daily and oxycodone as needed for breakthrough
pain. Her PICC line and foley catheter were left in place. Her
family received teaching about managing her indwelling catheter
prior to discharge.

# Hemoperitoneum: In the ICU, she was transfused a total of 3
units of pRBCs with HCT increase from 25.1 to 32.4. Due to
concern for bleeding from her splenectomy bed, interventional
radiology was consulted and recommended a repeat CT scan in
arterial phase to identify potential vessels to embolize. On
hospital day 2, after receiving renal-protective bicarb infusion
given her Cr 1.5, a CTA abdomen showed no active extravasation.
Since a repeat HCT was stable at 32.4 and 34.1, she was then
transferred to the gynecologic oncology service where HCT
trended downwards overnight from 34.1 to 30.4 to a nadir of 27.
As she was also tachycardic in the 100s and oliguric
(10-20cc/hr), she was transfused 2 additional units of pRBCs on
hospital day 3. During transfusion, her tachycardia improved to
the 90s and her urine output improved. Her post-transfusion HCT
was appropriate at 32. However, her hematocrit still continued
to trend downwards and per ACS recommendations, we did order a
tagged red cell scan, which showed no evidence of an acute
bleed. We therefore transfused her 2 more units of blood for a
HCT of 25.7. Her HCT did not show an appropriate rise and was
27.8 and she received another unit of blood. Labs were
discontinued after her code status changed.

# Acute Kidney Injury: Given her creatinine of 1.5 on admission,
she received renal-protective bicarb infusion prior to her CTA
abdomen. After her CTA abdomen, her creatinine increased from
1.1 to 1.8, and she was oliguric. A FeNa was 0.3% consistent
with pre-renal acute kidney injury, likely caused by a
combination of IV contrast and anemia. Her urine output improved
slightly and her creatinine decreased to 1.7 after her blood
transfusion on hospital day 3. However, she continued to be
oliguric (10-15cc/hr) on ho
