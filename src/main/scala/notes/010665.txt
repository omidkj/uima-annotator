ASSESSMENT:  This is a [**Age over 90 **]-year-old male with recurrent colon
cancer presenting for resection.  He was admitted for
preoperative and typed and crossed 2 units, made NPO past
midnight, except medications, and Hibiclens scrub to his
abdomen.  He was seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 957**].

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was taken to the operating room
and underwent exploratory laparotomy and ileocolectomy at the
ileocolonic anastomosis as well as a small bowel resection.
His blood loss is 300.  There are no complications.  This was
done under epidural and local anesthesia, and required no
transfusions.  Was given 3100 cc of Crystalloid and sent to
Recovery Room in stable condition.  Refer to operative
dictation for details.

Postoperatively, the patient had a nasogastric tube with a
pO2 of 73.  His hypertension which was controlled with
Nipride, plan was to take his nasogastric tube out the
following morning.  Postoperative, the patient's temperature
is 95 po, his heart rate was 50-60, blood pressure 187/70,
respirations 15 and again he was given IV Lopressor,
nitropaste.  He was transferred to the SICU for postoperative
monitoring.  He was continued on his captopril and isosorbide
and plan was to begin a nitroglycerin drip if his systolic
blood pressure increased over 150.

Respiratory he was diuresed with Lasix and supplemental
oxygen was continued.  Aggressive pulmonary toilet was
instituted.  He was on perioperative antibiotics at this
time.  Patient's epidural was left in postoperatively for
perioperative pain control.  Narcotic was taken out of the
mixture.

Patient on overnight postoperatively became agitated, and
combative, and was given some Ativan for sedation.  He was
hemodynamically stable making urine.  He had no chest pain.

Postoperative day one, the patient was continued on
Lopressor, Captopril, and Isordil for blood pressure control.
Pulmonary toilet was continued.  He is still on IV fluids, no
feedings.  He was also given prn Lasix for diuresis.  His
hematocrit was stable.

On postoperative day one, approximately 4 pm in the
afternoon, patient had desaturation into the 50s, which
increased to the 90s with bagging.  His blood pressure is in
the 170s sinus tachycardia, ST depression in V3 through V5.
He had no complaint of chest pain.  He had faint rales on
examination with rhonchi throughout.  Plan was to check
laboratories, give Lasix IV, and Lopressor for rate control
to rule out for myocardial infarction, given pulmonary
toilet, and contact Cardiology for consultation.

Cardiology saw the patient and recommendations were to cycle
cardiac enzymes to rule out ischemia and to recommend aspirin
from a cardiac perspective, to proceed with diuresis to
control heart rate and blood pressure with beta blocker and
ACE, nitroglycerin, and Morphine.

Postoperative day three, the patient's Lopressor was
continued.  CK was 974 with a MB of 12 and troponin of less
than 0.3.  Patient was also diuresed prn.  Patient did rule
in for myocardial infarction by troponin, however, the CKs
remained relatively flat and his electrocardiogram changes
resolved.  He did remain tachycardic and hypertensive.  My
recommendation is to continue aspirin, to increase beta
blocker for rate control.  Check his echocardiogram to
evaluate for systolic function, diurese to goal of [**11-21**] liters
negative for the day, follow CKs.  Hold on the Heparin drip.

On the [**7-16**] in the afternoon, the patient had
been suffering from progressive respiratory distress due to
the complications of his heart condition as well as
congestive heart failure, and had developed increasing
acidosis and hypertension and decreasing renal function.  He
was placed on mechanical ventilation and a PA catheter was
also placed to guide fluid therapy as well as pressors if
needed.  Echocardiogram obtained today showed an ejection
fraction of 40%, 2+ mitral regurgitation, and anteroseptal
hyperkinesis.

At that time, his picture appeared to be consistent with
sepsis in the setting of perioperative ischemia, and plan was
to start Levophed to support blood pressure, to begin Heparin
drip, to broaden his antibiotic coverage to attempt further
diuresis.  He is placed on amp of levo and Flagyl.

After discussion with family after these events, it was
decided to make the patient DNR with no chest compressions,
shock.  He did begin to respond to a Lasix boluses and was
finally put on a Lasix drip for which he diuresed well.
Pressors were able to be weaned, however, the patient did at
one point require Dobutamine for support as his Levophed was
weaned off.

On the [**6-21**], the patient was able to be extubated
to a shovel mask.  Additionally, his dobutamine was weaned to
off.  He had been restarted on trophic tube feeds and showed
some bowel activity with a small bowel movem
