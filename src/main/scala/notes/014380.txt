HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 64-year-old
female with a history of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (status post
autologous bone marrow transplant) who was recently admitted
with syncope of unclear etiology who presented with a
recurrent syncopal episode.

The patient is status post a recent admission on [**2186-4-20**] with syncope without a prodrome with a fall and seventh
left rib fracture.  During that hospitalization, the patient
had a 10-beat run of supraventricular tachycardia and
bradycardia to the 30s.  Electrophysiology felt there was no
evidence of sinus node dysfunction and recommended atenolol
and [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] of Hearts monitor.  The patient was also started
on Neurontin for headaches.  She has had a recent lumbar
puncture and magnetic resonance imaging with no evidence of
central nervous system lymphoma.  An echocardiogram was
unremarkable.  The patient was also started on prednisone as
an outpatient for questionable temporal arteritis.

On the morning of admission, the patient sat up on the edge
of her bed and blacked out.  She was possibly confused for a
few seconds and had bowel incontinence.  The patient woke up
and went back to bed.  Thirty minutes later, she stood up and
lost consciousness again and found herself on the floor.  She
again had bowel incontinence.  The patient pressed her [**Doctor Last Name **]
of Hearts monitor button both times.  There were no
palpitations or shortness of breath, and there were no
witnesses to these falls.

The patient has had continued headaches for six weeks with a
left eye droop, which is now slightly better.  The patient
denies nausea, vomiting, fevers, chills, constipation, or
diarrhea.  Otherwise, review of systems was negative.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Follicular low-grade lymphoma in [**2175**] secondary to
cervical lymphadenopathy.  She is status post autologous bone
marrow transplant from her brother in [**2185-2-5**].  She
was initially treated with six cycles of CHOP with recurrence
when diagnosed.  The patient then went on to have autologous
bone marrow transplant in [**2179**].  The patient was treated with
Rituximab in [**2184-7-5**] for nasopharyngeal recurrence.  The
patient then went on to have an autologous bone marrow
transplant in [**2185**].  The patient had a recent admission to
the Neurology Service in [**2186-3-6**] with persistent
temporal headaches.  Her primary oncologist is Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].
2.  Hypothyroidism and history of a thyroid nodule.
3.  Asthma.
4.  Fibromyalgia.
5.  Left cataract.
6.  Chronic headaches.
7.  Status post cholecystectomy.
8.  Status post total abdominal hysterectomy with bilateral
salpingo-oophorectomy.
9.  Recent admission in [**2186-4-6**] with syncope; ruled out
for a myocardial infarction, had a rib fracture, bradycardia,
and supraventricular tachycardic episodes with pauses and
discharge of [**Doctor Last Name **] of Hearts monitor.

ALLERGIES:  ASPIRIN, OXYCODONE, and CODEINE (which cause
nausea and vomiting).

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1.  Folate 1 mg by mouth once per day.
2.  Levothyroxine 75 mcg by mouth once per day.
3.  Gabapentin 300 mg by mouth three times per day.
4.  Prednisone 10 mg by mouth once per day.
5.  Atenolol 25 mg by mouth once per day.
6.  Tylenol No. 3 as needed.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is married.  She has one son.
She lives in [**Location 1456**] with her husband.  She is from [**Country 2559**].
Negative for alcohol, drug, or tobacco.  She does not work.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Temperature was 99.2
degrees Fahrenheit, her pulse was 93, her blood pressure was
136/56, her respiratory rate was 18, and her oxygen
saturation was 100% on room air.  In general, in no acute
distress.  Alert and oriented times three.  The mucous
membranes were moist.  The patient had left eye ptosis.  The
neck was supple.  There were no carotid bruits.  The heart
was regular with no murmurs, rubs, or gallops.  Pulmonary
examination revealed the lungs were clear to auscultation.
The abdomen was benign.  Extremities revealed no edema.  On
neurologic examination, cranial nerves II through XII were
intact.  Strength was [**5-10**] throughout all extremities.
Reflexes were 2+ throughout.  Normal finger-to-nose.

SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE BY ISSUE/SYSTEM:

1.  SYNCOPE ISSUES:  Upon admission, it was still unclear
what was causing the patient's syncope.  Her syncopal
episodes were associated with episodes of bradycardia as well
as hypotension.  These were without warning and occurred
suddenly; most often in the early morning.

The patient had two episodes of syncope while resting in bed.
These episodes were noted on telemetry.  The patient would be
bradycardic to the 30s with blood pressures of 60/palpable
with spontaneous resumption of her blood pressure to 100/60s
without intervention except laying supine.

The Electrophysiology Service saw the patient on admission
and performed a tilt table test on [**4-26**].  This showed
normal sinus node function.  No supraventricular tachycardia
with a baseline heart rate in the 40s.  After 25 minutes on
the table at 60 degrees, the patient developed hypotension to
the 50s which resolved after returning to the supine
position.  Electrophysiology surmised that the patient's
symptoms were likely due to autonomic dysfunction rather than
cardiac disease.

The patient had a second episode of bradycardia with
hypotension on [**4-28**] with good mentation.  Her blood
pressure returned to [**Location 213**] with an intravenous fluid bolus.
The patient's atenolol was then discontinued.

Because the patient had been complaining of persistent left
temporal headaches, with worsening over the past days, a
magnetic resonance imaging of the neck was obtained which
showed a soft tissue mass at the left skull base centered at
the jugular foramen.  This was thought likely to be a
recurrence of the patient's non-Hodgkin lymphoma.  The left
internal carotid artery was anterolaterally displaced on
imaging, and it was thought to be causing these syncopal
episodes as well as vagal stimulation.

On [**4-29**], the patient was transferred to the Bone Marrow
Transplant Service for further treatment and evaluation of
possible lymphoma recurrence.

Upon arrival to the Bone Marrow Transplant Unit, the patient
suffered from two to three episodes of hypotension,
bradycardia, and near syncope.  These episodes were sudden
and occurred while the patient laying in bed.  The patient
had some decreased mentation with difficulty to arouse her.
Telemetry monitoring showed her heart rate down to the high
20s and low 30s.

At this time, the [**Hospital Ward Name 332**] Intensive Care Unit resident was
called, and the patient was transferred to the Intensive Care
Unit for closer monitoring.  It was thought that the mass in
the patient's neck had to be biopsied.  Ear/Nose/Throat
Service and Neurology Service consultations were obtained
regarding biopsy.  The patient was also seen by
Radiology/Oncology Service, as well as Neurology Service, and
Neurology/Oncology Service.

The patient was then transferred to the Intensive Care Unit
on [**4-29**].

2.  SOFT TISSUE MASS ISSUES:  The patient had a biopsy by
Neurosurgery on [**4-29**] on the [**Hospital Ward Name **].  After this
biopsy, the patient was returned to the [**Hospital Ward Name 332**] Intensive Care
Unit for further care.

Preliminary pathology from the soft tissue mass does show
lymphoma; however, it appeared to be different than her
previous non-Hodgkin lymphoma.  It was thought at the time of
this dictation that the patient's mass was due to an
[**Doctor Last Name 3271**]-[**Doctor Last Name **] virus associated post transplant
lymphoproliferative disease.  At the time of this dictation,
the final pathology was still pending.

After one day in the Intensive Care Unit, the patient
suffered no more episodes of vagal stimulation and syncope,
