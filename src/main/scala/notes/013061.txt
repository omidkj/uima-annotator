IMAGING:
CT Head [**2146-10-13**]:
There is a large 90 x 54-mm intraparenchymal hemorrhage in the
right
parietooccipital region, with extension into and effacement of
the right
lateral ventricle. There is significant mass effect on the
neighboring
structures, resulting in a 17-mm leftward shift of the septum
pellucidum. In addition, there is a subdural component of the
hematoma at the right frontal convexity, best seen in image
3:12. There is a rightward subfalcine and uncal herniation
present. The left lateral ventricle is moderately dilated,
concerning for early hydrocephalus. There is mild effacement of
the quadrigeminal cistern, concerning for downward
transtentorial herniation.  There is fullness at the level of
the foramen magnum, concerning for early tonsillar herniation.
Constellation of findings is relatively unchanged in comparison
with the prior outside hospital study from [**2146-10-13**] at
11:15 a.m. There are no acute fractures. The middle ear cavities
and mastoid air cells are clear. There is mild mucosal
thickening of the ethmoid sinuses and mild mucosal thickening of
the right maxillary sinus. Remaining included portions of the
paranasal sinuses are clear. IMPRESSION: Large right
parietooccipital intraparenchymal hemorrhage with adjacent
subdural component overlying the right frontal convexity, with
extension into and effacement of the right lateral ventricle.
There is leftward subfalcine herniation, right-sided uncal
herniation, and early downward transtentorial herniation.

CT HEAD [**2146-10-24**]
A large focus of intraparenchymal hemorrhage centered in the
right occipital and parietal lobes is redemonstrated. There is
also surrounding hypodensity, indicative o
