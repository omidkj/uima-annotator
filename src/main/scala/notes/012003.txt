Moderately depressed LVEF.
RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

ascending aorta diameter. Normal aortic arch diameter. Simple
atheroma in aortic arch. Normal descending aorta diameter.
Simple atheroma in descending aorta.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify I was present in compliance with HCFA
regulations. The patient was under general anesthesia throughout
the procedure. The TEE probe was passed with assistance from the
anesthesioology staff using a laryngoscope. No TEE related
complications. The patient appears to be in sinus rhythm.
patient.
REGIONAL LEFT VENTRICULAR WALL MOTION:
N = Normal, H = Hypokinetic, A = Akinetic, D = Dyskinetic
Conclusions
Pre CPB:
No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of
the left atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of the right
atrium/right atrial appendage.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is moderately depressed (LVEF= 40-45 %), with
a basal inferoseptal aneurysm.
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch. There are simple
atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
There are three aortic valve leaflets. There is no aortic valve
stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. There are focal
calcifications seen at the sinotubular junction near the right
coronary sinus. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild to
moderate ([**2-2**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was
notified in person of the results.
Post CPB:
The patient is being AV paced on a phenylephrine infusion.
There is mild MR.
[**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] fraction is improved at 45-50%.
The visible contours of the thoracic aorta are intact.


Brief Hospital Course:
Ms [**Known lastname 16119**] was transfered from [**Hospital6 3872**] after
a cardiac catheterization revealed 3 vessel disease. After the
usual pre-operative cardiac surgery workup incluing echo and
carotid ul;trasound the patient was brought to the operating
room on [**12-4**]. PLease see the operative report for details, in
summary she had: Coronary artery bypass grafting x4 with the
left internal mammary artery to left anterior descending artery
and reverse saphenous vein graft to the right coronary artery
and the obtuse marginal artery. Her bypass time was 74 minutes
with a crossclamp of 62 minutes. She tolerated the operation
well and post-operatively was transferred from the operating
room to the cardiac surgery ICU in stable condition. In the
immediate post-op period she remained hemodynamically stable,
woke neurologically intact, was weaned from the ventilator and
extubated. On POD1 she continued to be hemodynamically stable
and was transferred from the ICU to the cardiac surgery stepdown
floor. All tubes, lines and drains were removed per cardiac
surgery protocol. The remainder of her hospital course was
uneventful. Once on the floor she worked with physical therapy
and the nursing staff to advance her activity level and recover
from her surgery. She made steady progress and on POD4 she was
discharged home
