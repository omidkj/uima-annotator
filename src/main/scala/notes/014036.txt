History of Present Illness:
77 woman with aortic stenosis (0.8cm2 on [**9-/2113**]), recurrent UTIs
and T2DM who with recent admission for UTI discharged [**7-30**] who
was called back to the ED today for Bcx growing Strep Viridans
x1 bottle. She was just discharged from [**Hospital1 18**] yesterday after
having presented on the day prior with dyspnea, felt to be
secondary to acute pulmonary edema.
.
In the ED the patient c/o mild dysuria but was otherwise w/o
fevers or chills. Nonausea or vomiting. No rashes. Her ED course
is unclear as no signout was given to the accepting floor team.
Per report, she received Ceftriaxone and IVF for an elevated
lactate.
.
On the floor, the patient was noted to be tachypneic to the 40s
at time of transfer to the floor with a systolic BP > 200 and
was triggered. She was given Lasix 20mg IV x1, albuterol and
ipratropium nebs, and the MICU team was called to evaluate her.
Patient was transferred to the MICU and she was treated with
Lasix; SOB and HTN resolved.  She remained afebrile.  On
transfer to the floor, patient was stable with no SOB,
palpitations, dysuria.  The ceftriaxone was continued.

BCx [**7-29**]:  Viridans streptococci, sensis pending
.
ECG [**7-30**]: Sinus rhythm. Non-specific ST-T wave changes. Compared
to the previous tracing of [**2114-6-5**] there is no diagnostic
interval change.
.
CXR [**7-30**]: (final read pending) Increased pulmonary haziness
consistent with pulmonary edema.
.
TTE [**8-2**]:
The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal
cavity size. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall
motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is moderately depressed (LVEF=
35-40 %). The diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and
arch levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets are severely
thickened/deformed. No masses or vegetations are seen on the
aortic valve, but cannot be fully excluded due to suboptimal
image quality. There is critical aortic valve stenosis (valve
area <0.8cm2). Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial mitral
regurgitation is seen.No masses or vegetations are seen on the
mitral valve, but cannot be fully excluded due to suboptimal
image quality. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not
be determined. There is a very small pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. No endocarditis or abscess
seen (cannot exclude). Moderate global hypokinesis (inferior
wall may be more hypokinetic). Critical calcific aortic
stenosis.

Brief Hospital Course:
77F with aortic stenosis (0.8cm2 on [**9-/2113**]), recurrent UTIs and
T2DM with recent hospitalization for SOB [**2-21**] pulmonary edema who
was called back to ED after discharge due to 1/4 bottles + blood
cx for S.Viridans, had flash pulmonary edema, went to the MICU
and the next day was stable and on floor.
.
#S. viridans bacteremia: Patient noted to have 1 out of 4
bottles from [**7-29**] growing S. viridans the evening after she was
discharged. No definitive source was identified at the time of
admission however. Urine culture from [**7-29**] grew mixed flora c/w
contamination, which could represent source.  She was asked to
return to the ER. Patient had repeat Blood and urine cultures
sent while in the ED and started on ceftriaxone. Patient
remained afebrile throughout the hospital stay and was
surveillance cultures were negative.  A TTE did not demonstrate
any clear vegetations.  Infectious disease team felt that
endocarditis could be ruled out given negative repeat blood
cultures, patient afebrile and no clear vegetations on TTE.
Thus, the positive blood culture was felt to be a contaminant.
Ceftriaxone was discontinued and patient was discharged.
- RECOMMEND REPEAT BLOOD CULTURE ON OUTPATIENT FOLLOW UP.
.

#Critical AS, acute systolic CHF/Dyspnea: On arrival to ER,
patient had an episode of anxiety and became dyspneic, very
similar to the episode which prompted recent admission.
Patient's chest x-ray demonstrated increased haziness consistent
with mild pulmonary edema without evidence of pneumonia.
Patient was treated with Lasix and O2 and dyspnea resolved.
Thought to be flash pulmonary edema in the setting of IV fluids
and patient's tight aortic stenosis.  A repeat TTE demonstrated
a diminished LVEF from testing 1 year ago.  1 year ago, EF was
>55% and on this admission was 35-40%.  Patient was re-started
on Lisinopril 2.5mg PO daily (she was on this before and then
stopped taking it for unclear reason) and [**Name (NI) 8863**] [**Name (NI) 8864**] was
increased from 25mg PO daily to 50mg PO daily. Patient was
advised to schedule an appointment with her cardiologist,
Dr.[**Last Name (STitle) **], with whom the case was discussed.

These findings were discussed with the patient and her son,
particularly with regards to the poor prognosis with regards to
her AS over the next few years..  We discussed with them the
indication for valve replacement.  They expressed their interest
in such a possibility.  We recommend referral to a cardiac
surgeon going forward.
.
#UTI: Patient's symptoms of dysuria resolved.  She was asked to
finish the course of Ciprofloxacin.
