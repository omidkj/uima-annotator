Admission Date:  [**2147-7-4**]     Discharge Date:  [**2147-7-12**]

Date of Birth:   [**2095-7-24**]     Sex:  F

Service:  [**Hospital 259**] MEDICAL FIRM

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Nausea, vomiting, and hypotension.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Patient is a 52-year-old woman
with a history of diabetes, coronary artery disease status
post coronary artery bypass grafting, chronic renal
insufficiency with a baseline creatinine of 4.5, who
presented to the Emergency Department with two days of
anorexia associated with nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.  She
had no complaints of chest pain or shortness of breath at the
time.  Her son phoned [**Pager number **] to have her taken to the Emergency
Department.  EMTs found her blood pressure to be 70/40 with
an initial fingerstick of 133.

In the Emergency Department, her blood pressure was somewhat
improved at 94/45, but subsequently fell to as low as
60/palp.  She was given aggressive fluid resuscitation with
response in her blood pressure to the 80s after 2 liters of
fluid.  She was also started on dopamine.  A 12-lead EKG in
the Emergency Department showed new T-wave inversions in
leads III and aVF, and the patient was admitted to the
Medical ICU for further management.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Diabetes.
2. Chronic renal insufficiency with a baseline of 4.5
trending upward over the past year.
3. Congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of 30%
in [**2147-2-1**].
4. Coronary artery disease status post CABG in [**1-1**] with a
LIMA to left anterior descending artery, saphenous vein graft
to PDA, and saphenous vein graft to OM-1.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS AT HOME:
1. Hydralazine 20 mg t.i.d.
2. Imdur 30 mg q.d.
3. Aspirin 325 mg q.d.
4. Valium 5 mg b.i.d. prn
5. Remeron 15 mg q.h.s.
6. Metformin 500 mg b.i.d.
7. Albuterol.
8. Lasix 40 mg q.d.
9. Lipitor 80 mg q.d.
10. Metoprolol 50 mg b.i.d.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Patient is primarily Spanish speaking.  She
lives with her son.  She is a [**2-2**] pack/day smoker, and has a
remote history of alcohol abuse.

PHYSICAL EXAM UPON ADMISSION TO THE MICU:  Vital signs:
Temperature 95.2.  Heart rate 67.  Blood pressure 96/45.  O2
saturation 99% on room air.  General:  She was an obese,
chronically ill-appearing Hispanic woman, who appeared older
than her stated age.  She was conversing appropriately and in
no acute distress.  HEENT:  She had drooping right eyelid.
Her oropharynx was extremely dry.  Chest was clear to
auscultation bilaterally, but noted to be dull at the right
base with no wheezes, rales, or rhonchi when assessed after
approximately 1.5 liters of IV fluids.  However, note was
made that crackles were present approximately [**2-3**] of the way
up bilaterally after she had received a total of 4 liters of
IV fluids.  Cardiovascular:  Regular, rate, and rhythm,
normal S1, S2 without murmurs.  Her abdomen was obese, soft,
nontender, nondistended with normal bowel sounds.
Extremities revealed 2+ edema bilaterally to the knees.

Initial laboratories on admission revealed a white blood cell
count of 11.6, hematocrit 31.3, platelets 369.  Differential
included 77 polys, 0 bands, 4 monocytes, and 3 eosinophils.
Coags revealed the PT of 14.7, INR of 1.4, PTT of 44.8.
Urinalysis revealed 500 protein, small leukocyte esterase,
21-50 RBC, [**7-11**] WBC, and few bacteria.  Chem-7 was notable
for a bicarb of 7, BUN of 103, and creatinine of 8.1.
Calcium was 8.4, magnesium 1.8, phosphorus 8.0.  LFTs were
within normal limits.  CK at the time of admission was
initially 201, increased to 255, and up to 402.  Troponin
went from 2.4 to 4.9.

ABG in the Emergency Department revealed a pH of 7.06, pCO2
of 29, pO2 of 67 with a lactate of 4.6.

Chest x-ray showed a small to moderate sized right sided
pleural effusion without evidence of pneumonia or congestive
heart failure.

EKG was sinus at 65 beats per minute with a prolonged P-R
interval of 246 milliseconds.  New T-wave inversions were
noted in leads III and aVF.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. Hypotension/shock:  The patient had initially been treated
with IV fluids and dopamine in the Emergency Department for
blood pressure support with the addition of bicarb to the IV
fluids for her acidosis.  Upon admission to the MICU, a
Swan-Ganz catheter was placed, which was suggestive of both
cardiogenic and hypovolemic shock with PA pressure of 54/23,
wedge of 20, CVP of 19.  Cardiac output and cardiac index of
4.4 and 2.7 respectively with a SVR of 919.  Blood pressure
improved dramatically with correction of volume and acid-base
status, and dopamine was quickly weaned off.  After the
volume resuscitation, patient was actually significantly
hypertensive.

2. Cardiovascular:  Patient's troponin ultimately trended to
greater than 50 in the setting of her renal failure.  Her
peak CK was 402 with a MB of 33 leading to an index of 8.
Cardiology was consulted.  The patient was given aspirin,
Heparin, and Lopressor after her blood pressure had
stabilized. Nitropaste and hydralazine were added for
afterload reduction as ACE inhibition was contraindicated.

Echocardiogram revealed an EF of 30-40% with inferolateral
and basal inferior akinesis, RV pressure and volume overload
with 3+ TR and 1+ MR.  Ischemia was thought to be secondary
due to demand.  Patient ultimately went to the Cath
Laboratory on [**2147-7-7**], which showed subtotal occlusion of
the distal RCA at the PDA, which is now status post PTCA and
stent.

Following catheterization, the patient was continued on
aspirin and Plavix in addition to her Lipitor for her
coronary artery disease.

3. Acute on chronic renal failure:  This is felt to be
secondary to ATN in the setting of her hypotension.  Patient
was started on hemodialysis in the MICU along with
erythropoietin and Amphojel.  All of her medications were
dosed for creatinine clearance of less than 10.  Renal
ultrasound showed normal sized kidneys without evidence of
hydronephrosis and good blood flow to the kidneys
bilaterally.  Metformin was held and hemodialysis was
performed by Permacath which was placed on [**2147-7-6**].
Creatinine improved to 6.0 at the time of transfer out of the
ICU on [**2147-7-8**], and hemodialysis was continued through the
time of discharge.

4. Acid base:  Patient was profoundly acidemic at the time of
admission with a gap metabolic acidosis secondary to lactate
from her state of hypoperfusion as well as metformin.  In
addition, she had a nongap metabolic acidosis likely from her
uremia as well as GI losses of bicarbonate.  Her initial ABG
was 7.06/29/67.  Patient was repleted aggressively with IV
fluids containing bicarbonate as well as p.o. sodium
bicarbonate.  ABG prior to transfer out of the ICU was
7.44/37/89.

5. Anemia:  The patient's anemia was initially thought to be
due to her renal failure with an acute drop secondary to
hemodilution from the aggressive volume resuscitation she
initially resolved.  She was started on Epo on [**2147-7-5**], and
transfused a total of 3 units of packed red cells on [**6-4**], and [**2147-7-8**] to maintain her hematocrit greater than
30 given her coronary artery disease.

On [**2147-7-8**], the day of transfer from the ICU, the patient's
Procrit was discontinued, and iron studies were consistent
with anemia of chronic disease.  Patient was continued to be
transfused on an as needed basis.

6. Hypertension:  As noted above, the patient was quite
hypertensive following her initial resuscitation.  In the
ICU, she had been treated with escalating doses of beta
blocker, hydralazine, and nitrates, plus hemodialysis for
treatment of volume overload.

At the time of discharge, her blood pressure was well
controlled with Lopressor 75 mg t.i.d., hydralazine 75 mg
q.6h., and the nitrates were discontinued.

7. Urinary tract infection:  The patient was treated with
levofloxacin renally dosed for an appropriate course.

8. Diabetes:  The patient had been managed as an outpatient
with metformin.  This was held on admission because of her
acidosis and acute renal failure.  She was covered by
insulin-sliding scale throughout her hospital stay.

9. Disposition:  Prior to discharge, the patient was
evaluated by Physical Therapy, who felt th
