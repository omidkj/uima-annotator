.
[**12-27**] Echo There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy
with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function
(LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall
motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: No pericardial effusion
.
PORTABLE AP CHEST RADIOGRAPH COMPARED TO [**2120-12-24**].

Low lung volumes are again noted with widespread bilateral
pulmonary opacities predominantly in perihilar right lower lobe
distribution but also with some asymmetric involvement of left
upper lobe. Bilateral pleural effusion is noted as well as
bibasilar atelectasis.

The ET tube tip is 5 cm above the carina. The NG tube tip can be
followed to the level of upper mid abdomen.

Overall, there is no significant change compared to the previous
film.

LIVER OR GALLBLADDER US (SINGL

Reason: CHOLANGITIS ? OBSTRUCTED CBD

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
65 year old woman with cholangitis
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
obstructed CBD?
INDICATION: Cholangitis. Evaluate for obstructed CBD.

COMPARISON: ERCP [**2120-12-22**].

FINDINGS: A very limited bedside portable evaluation was
performed. The gallbladder demonstrates abundant echogenic
material within which likely represents sludge and small
crystals. No definite stones are identified. No gallbladder wall
thickening or pericholecystic fluid is identified. There is
limited evaluation of the common bile duct which is dilated to
1.3 cm and likely contains sludge. The duct could not be
followed to the pancreatic head. A mild to moderate degree of
central intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation is noted.

IMPRESSION: Limited bedside evaluation with abundant gallbladder
sludge as well as common bile duct and intrahepatic biliary
ductal dilatation.

Reason: ? stent obstruction

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
65 year old woman with ascending cholangitis s/p ERCP x3 with
stenting x3 and sphincterotomy with new fever and hypotension
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
? stent obstruction
INDICATION: 65-year-old with ascending cholangitis status post
ERCP x3 with stenting and new fever and hypotension. Evaluate
for obstruction.

COMPARISON: Right upper quadrant ultrasound [**2120-12-26**].

RIGHT UPPER QUADRANT ULTRASOUND: Again seen is a large amount of
sludge and stones within the gallbladder
