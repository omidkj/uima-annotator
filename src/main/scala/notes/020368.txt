Allergies:
Morphine / Aspirin / Cephalosporins

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2485**]
Chief Complaint:
Septic Shock, Respiratory [**Hospital 67809**] transfer from OSH

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
intubation, central venous line

History of Present Illness:
This is a 73 year-old female with a PMH history of Parksinson's,
protein C/S deficency, multiple VTE off anticoag [**1-4**] to RP
hematoma with IVC filter, CKD, s/p partial colectomy with ostomy
who is transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] from OSH ([**Hospital1 14579**])a for further management and evaluation of septic shock
and respiratory failure.

Patient presented to OSH ED on [**2167-12-18**] with 2-3 days of general
malaise and abdominal pain at her colostomy site. She was
treated with Toradol and discharged back to her nursing home
with a diagnosis of constipation. She subsequently developed
respiratory distress and was sent back to the ED where she was
hypotensive and in shock. CXR revealed interstitial edema and
B/L PNA. She was given Lasix 80 mg IV x 1 for possible CHF. She
was started on levofloxacin, Flagyl, and vancomycin. She was
admitted to the ICU on [**2167-12-19**] with septic shock, acute
hypoxemic respiratory failure requiring intubation, and PNA. A
right IJ Precept catheter was placed along with a right arterial
line and she was aggressively resuscitated with IVF. She was
also started on levophed. She was found to have bibasilar E.coli
PNA and E.coli UTI. Nephrology was consulted for ARF on CRI
which was thought to be [**1-4**] to ATN from hypotension/sepsis.
Prior Toradol may also have contributed. TTE on [**2167-12-21**] showed
an EF of 55-60% with RV pressure of 46 mmHg. Initial creatinine
was 4.1, down to 3 on transfer. Levophed was weaned on [**2167-12-22**].
UCx and SCx grew E.coli, resistant to levofloxacin. ABx were
changed to aztreonam given her drug allergies. She was started
on tube feeds as well. Also presented with mild rhabdomyolysis
at 837 which improved with hydration.

ROS (per report): Denies F/C. Positive for nonproductive cough.
Denies CP or palpitations. No LE edema.

Past Medical History:
h/o B/L PNA
h/o septic shock in [**12-9**]

because of large retroperitoneal hematoma in [**11-7**], s/p IVC

C.diff negative x 1

UCx positive for E.coli, only sensitive to Cefazolin, tobra,
imipenem, and zosyn.

SCx: E.coli, same sensitivities

BCx: NGTD

EKG: NSR, no acute ST changes, normal axis and intervals.

Imaging:
CXR ([**12-23**]): Portable AP chest radiograph was compared to prior
study obtained on [**2166-12-31**]. No recent radiographs
obtained in the outside hospital are available for comparison.
The current study demonstrates ET tube tip being approximately
3.5 cm above the carina. The right internal jugular line tip
cannot be visualized but most likely in the right atrium. The NG
tube tip is in the stomach. The patient is after placement of
IVC filter. Left retrocardiac consolidation is demonstrated, new
compared to the prior study and might represent pneumonia.
Bilateral pleural effusions are seen.  Vascular engorgement is
present but no pulmonary edema is demonstrated.


Brief Hospital Course:
The following is a detailed discussion of her MICU course
through [**2168-1-8**]. Briefly, she was admitted with respiratory
failure and septic shock complicated by failure to wean from the
ventilator.  She had gram negative rod infection of lung and
urinary system.  Sepsis did resolve with antbiotic therapy over
initial week of hospitalization.  She had aggressive diuresis
with negative fluid balance.  Despite this she had persistent
and recurrent hypoxemia with attempts to wean from the
ventilator and required elevated PEEP pressures of >12 to
maintain PaO2>65 despite diuresis, ongoing antibtiotics and
recruitment maneuvers.  She had heparin continued outside of
times of active tracheal bleeding and there was no clinical
evidence to suggest PE.  She had prolonged course and had
clearly stated to her family that return to a level of function
to allow independent living prior to illness.  When faced with
decision to pursue Trach/PEG after > 14 days on ventilator in
the setting of weakness and persistent hypoxemia extensive and
repeated family meetings were held.  After discussion with her
family and health care proxy, she was made comfort measures only
and she was extubated on [**2168-1-7**]. She passed away from
cardiopulmonary arrest at 4am [**2168-1-8**].

MICU COURSE:
73 year-old female with a PMH history of Parkinson's, protein
C/S deficency, multiple VTE off anticoag [**1-4**] to RP hematoma with
IVC filter, CKD, s/p partial colectomy with ostomy who is
transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] from OSH ([**Hospital6 8972**])
for further management and evaluation of septic shock and
respiratory failure.

# Sepsis/recent septic shock: Sources previously found to be
resistant E. coli in urine and sputum, and MRSA in her sputum.
Sputum culture sensitivity shows sensitivity to meropenem,
zosyn, and cephalosporins. Pt unfortunately has an allergy to
beta lactams.  Initially treated with vanc, levo, flagyl and
switched to Aztreonam once sensitivities returned however per
ID, aztreonam not a good singel source [**Doctor Last Name 360**], changed to
meropenem.  Spurum cx returned with MRSA, initially treated with
vancomycin but changed to Linezolid for better MRSA coverage. Pt
also noted to have a positive fungal culture from [**12-23**], her
subsequent bld cultures have not been positive however even with
one positive result fungemia is a concern. Pt was started on
Caspofungin. Sensitivities fort Voriconazole and Fluconazole
have been ordered an
