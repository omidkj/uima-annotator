Mr. [**Known lastname 38598**] is a 39 year old patient with NHL s/p allo SCT [**2155**]
and DLI [**2156**], in remission but with GVHD-associated
bronchiolitis obliterans and severe restrictive lung disease and
vent dependent who was recently admitted with fever, hypoxia and
respiratory distress and discharged to [**Hospital1 **] on [**2162-7-20**]. He
returned to the ED today for CP since yesterday AM. Pt states
that the CP began after PT yesterday lasted for 30 min then
resolved, however SOB persisted. CP was sharp, R-sided,
non-radiating and improved with morphine x1 and did not recur.
He was also tachycardic to 130s at [**Hospital1 **], temp to 99.9. Also
c/o N/V/D, with 2-3 episodes of diarrhea and vomiting q day,
non-bloody. Pt states that he has a chronic cough however this

[**2162-5-19**], for details of his previous hospitalizations. In brief,
the patient had pseudomonal infection of his lungs, he had been
treated with 21 day course of Colistin and Meropenem, and was on
Colistin IH for suppression. Additionally, he had an upper
extremity DVT that was treated with fondaparinux 2.5mg, which
was discontinued in early [**Month (only) 205**]. On the last admission, pt was
treated for pseudomonal pneumonia and bilateral pneumothoraces,
discharged on Colistin and Meropenem per ID recs, last date of
abx [**2162-7-28**]. Pneumothoraces resolved with chest tube placement.
.
In the ED, initial vs were: 130 110/70. CXR was done and was
concerning for new infiltrate, therefore patient was given
vancomycin. Vitals on transfer 99.9 109 116/86 AC 30 100%.
.
On the floor, pt states SOB is persisting, however CP resolved.

Past Medical History:
Past Oncologic History:
- [**4-/2154**] p/w fevers, night sweats, and weight loss in the
setting of a left inguinal lymph node.
- CT scan: 15x14x10cm mass in the LUQ.
- Bx grade II/III follicular lymphoma.
- Treated with six cycles of CHOP/Rituxan with good response,
but showed evidence for relapse in [**12/2154**] and was treated with
MINE chemotherapy for two cycles.
- [**3-/2155**]: Underwent stem cell mobilization with Cytoxan followed

by autologous stem cell transplant in
- [**7-/2155**]: Noted for disease recurrence. He was initially treated

with a course of Rituxan without response followed by Zevalin
with
- [**3-/2156**]: Noted progression of his disease. He was treated with

one cycle of [**Hospital1 **] followed by one cycle of ESHAP.
- [**2156-7-29**]: Nonmyeloablative allogeneic stem cell transplant
with a [**5-30**] HLA-matched unrelated donor with Campath conditioning

- Six-month follow-up CT noted for disease progression.
- [**1-/2157**]: Received donor lymphocyte infusion in , complicated by

acute liver/GI GVHD grade IV, for which [**Known firstname **] required a
prolonged hospitalization in the summer of [**2156**].
- Multiple GI bleeds requiring ICU admissions and multiple
transfusions and embolization of his bleeding.
- Noted to have CNS lesions felt consistent with PTLD and this
was treated with a course of Rituxan. No evidence for recurrence

of the PTLD.
- Acute liver GVHD, on CellCept, prednisone, and photophoresis.

- [**2157-12-28**] Photophoresis was d/c'd due to episodes of
bacteremia and eventual removal of his apheresis catheter.
- [**2158-6-13**] restarted photopheresis on a weekly basis on , but
then discontinued this again on [**2158-9-7**] as this was felt not
to be making any impact on his liver function tests.
- undergone phlebotomy due to iron overload with corresponding
drop in his ferritin. He has continued with transient rises in
his transaminases and bilirubin and has remained on varying
doses of CellCept and prednisone which has been slowly tapered
over the time.
- [**2160-1-10**] CellCept discontinued.
- [**2159-1-19**] admission due to increasing right hip pain. MRI
revealed edema and infiltrating process in the psoas muscle
bilaterally. After extensive workup, this was felt related to an

infection and required several admissions with completion of
antibiotics in 03/[**2158**].
- [**7-/2160**]: Last scans showed no evidence for lymphoma and he has

remained in remission.
- [**2160-10-20**]: URI and treatment with course of Levaquin.
- [**2160-11-13**] completed a 4 week course of Rituxan to treat his
GVHD.
-In [**5-/2161**], noted to have tiny echogenic nodule on abdominal
[**Year (4 digits) 950**]. MRI of the liver also showed this nodule but was not

as concerning on review and he is due to have a repeat MRI
imaging in early [**Month (only) **].
-- GI varices and attempts at banding have been unsuccessful due

to difficulty with passing the necessary instruments. He has
been on a low dose beta blocker as well as simvastatin, which
was started on [**2161-7-7**] to help with medical management of his

varices.
-On [**2161-8-3**], worsening cough and was noted to have a small
new pneumothorax in the left apical area. This has essentially
resolved over time
- Issues with weight loss (followed by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]);
multiple tests done with no etiology found; question
malabsorption related to GVHD
- Has on and off respiratory infections and has been treated
with antibiotics (now colistin inhaled and IV) for resistant
pseudomonas. Question underlying exacerbations of pulmonary GVHD

in setting of his URIs.
- Currently receives IVIG every month.
