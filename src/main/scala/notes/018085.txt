Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1838**]
Chief Complaint:
altered mental status

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
 68 F, of unclear handedness, hx of DM2, HTN, HLD, prior DVT,
CRF, and metastatic endometrial CA, s/p recent onset of
taxol/carboplatin chemo, received her second cycle of chemo [**7-2**]
and since then has been acting "disoriented" per her son with
whom she lives. He notes for example, that she is easily
distractable, will wander from one room to another while in the
middle of a task (e.g. making a [**Location (un) 6002**]), however, has been
able
to complete her ADL's including cooking and going for walks to
the market. This morning, he saw her last normal around 6:30 am
and had helped give her insulin shot. When he returned from work
around 5:30 pm, he found her sitting on the floor of their
living
room, very confused and seeming overall fatigued. He was able to
move her to the couch and took her FS, which was 145. He then
called EMS. He felt her speech was dysarthric, but felt that
there was no focal weakness, sensory changes, HA, VC, ataxia,
trouble understanding or expressing language, or any B/B
incontinence. Of note, she had been on coumadin for her DVT up
until [**2178-6-6**], and was then switched to lovenox [**1-12**] her chemo
regimen.

Physical Exam:
98.1F 112 110/67 16 100%RA

Gen: Lying in bed, NAD
HEENT: NC/AT, moist oral mucosa
Neck: No tenderness to palpation, normal ROM, supple
CV: irreg irreg, Nl S1 and S2, no murmurs/gallops/rubs
Lung: Clear to auscultation bilaterally
aBd: +BS soft, nontender
ext: no c/c/e; equal radial and pedal pulses B/L.

Neurologic examination:
Mental status: Awake and alert, cooperative with exam, normal
affect.  Oriented to person, place given mult choices, but not
date.  Inattentive, cannot say DOW forewards or backwards.
Speech is fluent with normal comprehension but poor repetition;
poor naming (calls fingers "hand", states "thumb" when asked to
name pointer finger. (+) dysarthria (seeming more gutteral).
Never learned how to read or write.  (+) right left confusion.
(+) Left neglect (thinks her L hand is the examiner's hand)

Cranial Nerves:
Pupils equally round and reactive to light, 5 to 4 mm
bilaterally. Visual fields seem to show a L VF deficit (she has
poor BTT coming from the left). Extraocular movements intact
bilaterally, no nystagmus (though very difficult to get her to
voluntarily look left, eyes able to move left on VOR having her
fix on my nose and turning head side to side) Sensation intact
V1-V3.  Facial movement symmetric.  Hearing intact to finger rub
bilaterally.  Palate elevation symmetrical.  Sternocleidomastoid
and trapezius normal bilaterally. Tongue midline, movements
intact

Motor:
Normal bulk bilaterally. Tone normal. No observed myoclonus or
tremor
Not completely cooperative with full strength testing, but
within
this context, appears to have full strength in the UE and in the
LE at the IP, Ham and Quad, with the exception of perhaps 5-/5
in
the Left Ham (though could be [**1-12**] inattention. Did not cooperate
with DF, PF, TE, TF testing)

Sensation: Seems to indicate a decrease in [**Last Name (un) 36**] to LT and PP in
the LUE and LLE, without a clear level. Otherwise intact to
light
touch, pinprick, and proprioception throughout. (+) extinction
to
DSS on the L.

Reflexes:
+2 and symmetric throughout except at patellae which were 0
(though again, not relaxing enough for appropriate testing)
Toes downgoing bilaterally

Coordination: Able to do finger to nose x 1 without clear ataxia
or dysmetria. Could not cooperate with further coord testing.

Gait: Narrow based, but very small steps, almost shuffling. Son
states this is quite different from baseline.

Romberg: Negative

[**2178-7-7**] CT head;
IMPRESSION: New rounded areas of hypodensity within the left
temporooccipital
and parietal lobes and left cerebellum concerning for metastatic
disease in
patient with history of endometrial cancer. An MRI with and
without contrast
is recommended for further evaluation.

[**2178-7-9**] MRI brain:
FINDINGS: There are multifocal areas of high T2/FLAIR signal
intensity within the supra and infratentorial compartments, with
large areas of abnormality involving the posterior right
temporal and medial left temporal lobes. Additional foci are
seen in the occipital lobes, deep white matter, and scattered
throughout the cerebellum. The larger of the lesions demonstrate
high signal on DWI with corresponding low signal on ADC,
compatible with infarcts. The smaller lesions are too small to
characterize on the ADC maps.

There is no evidence of intracranial hemorrhage or shift of
normally midline structures. No discrete mass is identified,
though assessment is limited as there were no post- contrast
imaging. The ventricles and sulci are mildly prominent, likely
affecting age- related atrophy. Visualized paranasal sinuses and
mastoid air cells are normally aerated.

On MRA, the carotid and vertebral arteries appear within normal
limits without evidence of stenosis, occlusion, or aneurysm
formation.

IMPRESSION:
1. Multifocal infarcts within the supra and infratentorial
compartments,
including watershed regions. These findings most likely
represent embolic
infarcts, as the vasculature appears patent without stenosis or
occlusion.
2. Limited assessment for intracranial metastases as no
post-contra
