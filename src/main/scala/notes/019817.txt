History of Present Illness:
68 y.o. male with known AS now with progressive dyspnea and
fatigue. He can't walk up or down a flight of stairs, or go out
to the mailbox at 50 feet, without experiencing moderate
dyspnea. This resolves with rest. He denies any LE edema. He
states he cannot sleep on his back as he wakes up gasping for
breath. He sleeps on his side without any difficulty. He has
always slept with 2 pillows. He denies and chest pain,
difficulty breathing at rest, dizziness, lightheadedness,
palpitations, or presyncope. His last syncopal episode was over
25 years ago. Overall he feels his energy level is not what it
used to be and he is always tired and fatigued. Recently has had
rectal bleeding related to rectal proctitis from radiation
treatments for his prostate CA in Novemember [**2132**]. Undergoing
colonoscopies every few weeks for thermal therapy. BRBPR and
required blood transfusion in [**Month (only) 547**]. In light of his worsening
symptoms he was referred for right and left heart
catheterization for further evaluation of his aortic valve in
preparation of possible surgical intervention, which revealed
40% LAD lesion. He is admitted today for Heparin bridge with
plans for AVR/? CABG in AM.

Pertinent Results:
[**2133-6-26**] Echo: PREBYPASS: No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or
color Doppler. There is moderate symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is mildly dilated.
Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
ascending aorta is mildly dilated. There are simple atheroma in
the descending thoracic aorta. The aortic valve leaflets are
severely thickened/deformed. There is moderate aortic valve
stenosis (valve area 1.0-1.2cm2). Moderate (2+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Moderate [2+]
tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
POSTBYPASS: Biventricular systolic function remains normal.
There is a well seated, well functioning bioprosthesis in the
aortic position. There is trace valvular AI. The study is
otherwise unchanged from prebypass.
.
CXR [**2133-6-30**]: Unchanged left basilar atelectasis and small
bilateral pleural
effusions.  Unchanged moderate cardiomegaly.  No pulmonary
edema.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 108858**] was admitted one day prior to surgery for Heparin
bridge and usual pre-operative work-up. Prior to surgery, he was
desensitized to Aspirin. On [**6-26**] he was brought to the operating
room where he underwent an aortic valve replacement and coronary
artery bypass graft x 1. Please see operative report for
surgical details. Following surgery he was transferred to the
CVICU for invasive monitoring in stable condition. POD one found
the patient extubated, alert and oriented and breathing
comfortably.  The patient was neurologically intact and
hemodynamically stable, weaned from inotropic and vasopressor
support.  Beta blocker was initiated and the patient was gently
diuresed toward the preoperative weight.  Dofetilide and
Coumadin were resumed per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  The patient was
transferred to the telemetry floor for further recovery.  Chest
tubes and pacing wires were discontinued without complication.
The patient was evaluated by the physical therapy service for
assistance
