History of Present Illness:
HPI: 70yo male w/hx of Multiple Sclerosis and chronic indwelling
foley who was brought to ED via EMS after having a witnessed
syncopal event on [**2-26**]. While eating dinner, he lost
conciousness and his head fell back and his arms went up. He was
noted by his wife and son to be gurgling. His family denies any
prodromal complaints aside from fatigue a few days prior. The
EMS team found him to be unresponsive with some emesis in his
mouth. Pt brought to ED, intubated for airway protection.
Received Vanco/Cefepime/Clinda initially and an additional
2Liters of NS. MICU course notable for hypotension unresponsive
to IVF requiring intermittient Levophed gtt.
Additionally a CT head postive for L post/temp intraparenchymal
bleed which was then re-read as an AVM. CT Angiogram of the
Chest was performed and revealed a R subsegmental non-occlusive
thrombi with a chronic appearance. While in the MICU the pt
failed [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 104**] stim test, developed aspiration pneumonia, had
labile blood pressures requiring Nitroprusside gtt, and [**11-21**]
positive bld cx for Staph Epi. Pt ruled out for MI, Echo was
nml, and EKG with old AV delay and type I 2nd degree AV block
(Wenkebach)with a normal rate.

Brief Hospital Course:
70yo male with hx of Multiple Sclerosis and chronic indwelling
foley catheter a/w syncope, aspiration pneumonia, and possible
intraparenchymal CNS bleed.
1. Hypotension/Syncope: Hypotension resolved while in MICU. [**Month (only) 116**]
have been related to septic physiology on presentation. CTA with
non-occlusive segmental thrombi in R pulm art. which was thought
to be chronic and not related to primary event. Echo w/ nml EF
and wall motion, and valves, CT head with AVM stable on repeat
imaging and confirmed by MRI/MRA, EEG w/o epileptiform activity.
Pt has h/o vaso-vagal symptoms and was eating at the time of the
event which is the most likely cause. 1st degree AV block with
Wenckebach intermittently would not be a cause of syncope since
his heart rate was always normal. Neurosurgery consultation
recommended anticoagulation with Hep gtt while in house given
the PE and pt is immobile, but no long term anticoagulation is
recommended (pt is a fall risk, risk of CNS bleed, and PE is an
incidental finding)Bilateral LENIS were negative. We
specifically discussed with the patient about all the risks and
benefits of being anticoagulated and also not being
anticoagulated.  He understood everything and agreed with the
plan.  His outpt neurologist at [**Hospital1 2025**] was also contact[**Name (NI) **] and is
aware of his hospitalization.

2. ARF: Likely due to hypotension/ATN vs UTI. Normalized with
fluids.

3. ID: Bilateral aspiration PNA, + MRSA, and possible
bacteremia. Intubated for two days. Blood cultures only [**11-21**] grew
Coag neg staph, thought to be a contaminant. MRSA grew in
sputum. Total body macular rash developed while pt was on Zosyn
and Ceftriaxone.
-initially covered w/Vanco/Zosyn Dced upon transfer to floor.
Was on Clinda for two days but spiked through it to 103. Started
Flagyl/Aztreonam/Vanc [**3-1**] given allergy to quinolone and ? rash
to cephalosporins.
-DC A-line and DC Central Line [**2-28**], sent tip for culture.
-Surveillance cultures were all negative. Repeat CXR with slight
improvement.
-Pt has chronic indwelling foley but U/A has been negative.

4. Neuro: Multiple Sclerosis, and h/o CNS AVM. Pt seen by
neurology and neurosurgery early in hospital course. Pt was
deconditioned, weak, and fatigued for most of his stay with
limited mobility. Will need aggressive PT and cont treatment for
MS. [**Name13 (STitle) **] been on Cytoxan in the past and is followed by [**Hospital1 2025**]
Neurologist.
