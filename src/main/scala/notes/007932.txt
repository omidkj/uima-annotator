CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Fever, diarrhea, and shortness of breath.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  A 65-year-old woman with
progressive multiple sclerosis diagnosed approximately 11
diarrhea.  At her baseline she can only speak a couple of
words and responds to questions with hand squeezing.

Approximately two month prior to admission she developed
diarrhea with intermittent fevers.  She was taken to [**Hospital6 3622**] and diagnosed with a urinary tract infection
and treated with a course of levofloxacin.  On [**12-4**],
Hospital where she developed a pneumothorax after central
line placement.  A colonoscopy on [**2189-12-8**]
reportedly showed ischemic colitis, and she was discharged.
On [**2189-12-10**], she again developed fever to 103, now
with shortness of breath and congestion.  No cough, but she
normally cannot cough.  Her diarrhea is typically five to six
large volume stools with mucous, without any [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] day.

Upon presentation to the Emergency Department she was
lethargic with temperature equal to 101.4 rectally,
pulse 120, [**First Name3 (LF) **] pressure 96/50, with a saturation of 94% on
2 liters.  She responded well to hydration and became much
more alert.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Multiple sclerosis diagnosed approximately 11 years ago;
followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 25427**].  It has been recently rapidly
progressive.
2.  Suprapubic catheter placed about two years ago and
recurrent urinary tract infections.
3.  History of bladder stones.
4.  History of renal stones, status post lithotripsy and
surgical interventions.
5.  Aspiration pneumonia approximately three years ago in the
setting of hospitalization.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1.  Baclofen 10 mg p.o. b.i.d.
2.  Neurontin 300 mg p.o. q.a.m. and 600 mg p.o. q.p.m.
3.  Claritin 10 mg p.o. q.d.
4.  Atropine for her diarrhea which was prescribed on
[**2189-12-8**], after the colonoscopy at [**Hospital6 3426**].

ALLERGIES:  PENICILLIN gives a rash.  VANCOMYCIN gives a
rash.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  She lives in an [**Hospital3 **] elderly
facility.  No tobacco.  No alcohol use.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  On examination
temperature was 101.4, pulse 110, [**Hospital3 **] pressure 120/64,
respiratory rate 25, saturation 97% on 2 liters.  In general,
she was in no acute distress, able to answer questions by
squeezing hands.  Head, ears, nose, eyes and throat
examination revealed mucous membranes were moist.  Pupils
were equal, round, and reactive to light.  Sclerae were
anicteric.  Her neck was stiff, which is baseline.  It was
difficult to assess jugular venous distention from her
posture.  Respiratory revealed coarse breath sounds
anteriorly.  Rhonchi at bases, left greater than right.
Cardiovascular was tachycardic.  A 3/6 systolic murmur at the
left upper sternal border which is known.  Abdominal was
soft, left upper quadrant tenderness.  No peritoneal signs.
Suprapubic tube indwelling without erythema.  Extremities
revealed dorsalis pedis and posterior tibialis pulses were 2+
bilaterally.  No cyanosis, clubbing or edema.  Feet were
contracted.

LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:  White [**Hospital3 **] cell count 18;
90 neutrophils, 5.4 lymphocytes, 4.2 monocytes.
Hematocrit 37.1, platelets 425.  SMA-7 revealed sodium
of 135, potassium 3.3, chloride 103, bicarbonate 21, [**Hospital3 **]
urea nitrogen 10, creatinine 0.5, glucose of 139.  Liver
function tests were pending.  Amylase and lipase were
pending.  When seen in the Emergency Room urinalysis
remarkable for moderate [**Hospital3 **], specific gravity of 1.015,
pH 5, nitrite negative, 2 red [**Hospital3 **] cells, 11 to 20 white
[**Hospital3 **] cells, many bacteria, 3 to 5 epithelial cells.

RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:   Chest x-ray revealed kyphotic woman with
a left lower lobe infiltrate consistent with pneumonia.

Electrocardiogram revealed sinus tachycardia at a rate
of 102, axis approximately zero, intervals 142/80/340.  A
T wave inversion in III.

ASSESSMENT:  This is a 65-year-old woman with a history of
multiple sclerosis evaluated by Neurology in the Emergency
Department who presents with a fever, pneumonia by chest
x-ray, and left upper quadrant tenderness.  The patient will
be started on levofloxacin and Flagyl for the possibility of
an aspiration pneumonia.  As per the Neurology evaluation in
the Emergency Room, there did not seem to be any appreciable
neurologic change from baseline.  Gastrointestinal workup
with stool for C. difficile times three will be sent given
history of recent antibiotic use.  A Gastrointestinal
consultation will be obtained to evaluate this ongoing
chronic diarrhea.  The patient will be given fluids.

HOSPITAL COURSE:   On [**12-12**] an abdominal CT was
obtained that showed bibasilar consolidation, left greater
than right, and bilateral pleural effusions.  The urine
culture sent from the Emergency Department grew out
enterococcus, and she was started on vancomycin.  She has a
prior history of a rash to vancomycin, so the patient was
premedicated with Benadryl, and the vancomycin was run over
six hours.  She tolerated this without complications.

The abdominal CT showed no evidence of ischemic colitis.  On
[**12-13**] a rash was noted, and her antibiotics were
changed to ceftriaxone and clindamycin, and then to
clindamycin and vancomycin.  Her oxygen saturations continued
to be in the high 90s on 4 liters demonstrating her
significant oxygen requirement.

On [**12-14**], she developed a increased oxygen requirement,
and on chest x-ray was noted to have left lower lobe
collapse.  An arterial [**Month (only) **] gas at that time was 7.44/34/99.
Clindamycin was discontinued at that time and Flagyl was
started.  A bronchoscopy was performed that revealed thick
secretions which were suctioned and demonstrated no mucous
plus or endobronchial lesions.  For the gastrointestinal
workup, Clostridium difficile times three was negative.

On [**12-14**], an Infectious Disease consultation was
obtained and thought the rash was secondary to ceftriaxone.
For the pneumonia she was restarted on Levaquin and Flagyl,
and vancomycin was continued for the enterococcus urinary
tract infection.

On [**12-15**], the colonoscopic biopsy at [**Hospital6 3426**] were reviewed here at this hospital which showed
right colon with nonspecific inflammation of the lamina
propria without active colitis, and in the left colon
melanosis coli.  These findings were possibly consistent with
laxative use.

The patient also had a few episodes of mucous plugging which were
cleared with deep suctioning which also triggered
a cough.  A chest x-ray demonstrated persistent collapse of
the left lower lobe.  A thoracentesis was done to evaluate
the pleural effusion on the left side; 600 cc of bloody fluid
was drained with a hematocrit of 5%.  Studies revealed an
exudative process with a pH of 7.37.  A chest x-ray after the
thoracentesis demonstrated improved aeration.

On [**12-15**], lower extremity Doppler was performed that
were negative for deep venous thrombosis.

On [**12-16**], the patient's elevated INR was reversed with
vitamin K.  The elevated INR was thought secondary to
nutritional deficiency and antibiotic use.  Her tube feeds
were restarted, and her diarrhea was resolving.  After the
tube feeds were started the patient had another episode of
respiratory distress thought secondary to aspiration.
Electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia with diffuse
inferior T wave inversions.  At that time, a CT angiogram was
also done that revealed partially occlusive pulmonary emboli
in the left upper lobe lingula and proximal segment of left
lower lobe with some interval decrease in the pleural
effusions.  With these findings, the patient was started on
heparin.

On [**12-17**], the patient had another episode of
respiratory distress.  An arterial [**Month (only) **] gas done at that
time was 7.44/33/72.  This resolved with deep suctioning and
aggressive pulmonary toilet.  Her tube feeds continued to be
held secondary to high residuals and concerns for aspiration.
