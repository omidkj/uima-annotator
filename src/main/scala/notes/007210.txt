Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 800**]
Chief Complaint:
Fall

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Right Hip Hemiarthroplasty
Upper Endoscopy


History of Present Illness:
75 yo F with a past medical history of hypertension,
hypothyroidism, low back pain, and possible osteoperosis
presents s/p fall. Patient was in her USOH when she tripped
getting out of the car after dinner with her sister. Of note,
she had 2 glasses of wine at dinner. She landed on her right
hip, which initially was not uncomfortable. She denies chest
pain, LOC, head trauma, dizziness and syncope. She crawled to
the stairs of her house but could not get inside. [**Name (NI) **]
sister usually calls her after dinner to make sure she arrived
home, and she sent her nephew to check on her who found her in
the driveway.

Patient was initially brought to the [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]. There a CXR was
read as consistent with COPD and plain films of the hip and
pelvis on the right revealed femoral neck fracture. She was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further care.

On ride to ED, patient noted acute onset nausea and vomitted
once, which was coffee ground. She was also noted to have
tachycardia and received 1.6 L fluids in the ED. She was guaiac
negative and found to have a Hct of 32 with no known baseline.
She received Dilaudid 1 mg IV x1 and Pantoprazole 40 mg IV x1.
She vomitted a total of 3 times. EKG showed sinus tachycardia.
Orthopedics evaluated here and advised admit to MICU. On
transfer VS were 98.4, 100, 115/60, 16, 94% RA.

In the ICU, patient reports [**9-4**] Right hip pain but otherwise
feels well.

Of note, patient has had chronic low back pain worked up by her
PCP and recently had an outpatient MRI last week but she has not
received the results of this. She also completed a 10 day
prednisone course for her "low back pain", which consisted of 40
mg tablets and completed last Tuesday.

IMAGES/STUDIES:

ECG [**2114-4-22**]:
Sinus tachycardia. Normal tracing except for rate. No previous
tracing available for comparison.

RIGHT FEMUR AP & LATERAL [**2114-4-22**]:
COMPARISON: Reference radiograph of pelvis ([**Hospital1 **] ER; 4 hrs
prior).
FOUR VIEWS OF THE RIGHT FEMUR: There is a transversely oriented
right femoral neck fracture, with overriding of the distal
fracture fragment. there is no distal femoral fracture, but
there is severe tricompartmental degenerative change in the
right knee. At the superolateral aspect of the patella, round,
nearly confluent soft tissue calcifications are seen.
IMPRESSION:
1. Transversely oriented impacted fracture of the right femoral
neck with overriding of fracture fragments.
2. Possibly intra-articular soft tissue calcification which may
represent synovial osteochondromatosis, loose bodies, or less
likely tumoral calcinosis. Consider MRI for further
characterization on a non-emergent, outpatient basis following
treatment of the acute hip fracture.

SINGLE PORTABLE SUPINE VIEW OF THE CHEST [**2114-4-22**]:
The cardiomediastinal contour is normal. The heart is not
enlarged. However, the aortic arch is calcified. The lungs
demonstrate no focal consolidation or evidence of congestive
heart failure. Osseous structures and soft tissues are
unremarkable except for moderate degenerative change in the
upper lumbar spine, partially imaged. IMPRESSION: No evidence of
acute process.

URINE CULTURE (Preliminary):
      ENTEROBACTER CLOACAE.    >100,000 ORGANISMS/ML..
         This organism may develop resistance to third
generation
         cephalosporins during prolonged therapy. Therefore,
isolates that
         are initially susceptible may become resistant within
three to
         four days after initiation of therapy.  For serious
infections,
         repeat culture and sensitivity testing may therefore be
warranted
         if third generation cephalosporins were used.
      GRAM NEGATIVE ROD #2.    10,000-100,000 ORGANISMS/ML..

Brief Hospital Course:
75 y/o F with hx of HTN, hypothyroidism and c.diff colitis who
presented with hip fracture and coffee ground emesis. GI
bleeding resolved and she had an uncomplicated ORIF of R femur.
Recent presented to the ICU with afib with RVR and fevers. Afib
resolved.
.
# Upper GI bleed. Patient was evaluated by the GI and underwent
an EGD that did not show any signs of active bleeding.
Subsequently she underwent hemiarthroplasty of the right hip and
received 1 unit of pRBC intraoperatively.  Patient was
tachycardic post-operatively and went into afib w/ RVR, however
hct remained stable throughout this time.  Patient discharged
with outpatient GI follow up.
- Outpatient follow up
.
# Right hip fracture: Pain was controlled with standing
acetam
