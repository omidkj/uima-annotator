Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2751**]
Chief Complaint:
upper gastrointestinal bleed.


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
HPI: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is an 89-year-old man with a past medical
history significant for CAD (s/p CABGx3 [**2150**]), dCHF (EF 55%),
DMII, CKD, DVT right leg x2, prior GIB presenting with
hypotension and hematemesis from nursing home. Per report, the
patient developed worsening abdominal pain at the nursing home
yesterday afternoon. The report from the NH documents that he
vomited undigested food, and then this morning he vomited a
large amount of coffee ground materal. His vital signs at this
time, as documented, were BP 88/48, HR 93, RR 22, T 98.4,
satting 97% RA. He was then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further
management.

In the ED, he was noted to have elevated lactate 6.0. He was
hypotensive to the 60s but with normal hematocrit of 42.7. Other
labs were notable for white count of 13.3 and platelets of 63.
Creatinine was 3.1, up from baseline 1.5. UA showed few
bacteria, trace leuk esterace, neg nitrites, and few bacteria.
CXR showed increased opacities at the right hemithorax, greater
at the lung base, could represent aspiration, developing
pneumonia, or possibly asymmetric pulmonary edema. He then
underwent abdominal/pelvic CT scan that showed urinary bladder
wall thickening consistent with cystitis versus neoplasm.
Notably, there was no evidence of bowel ischemia. Urology and
gastroenterology consult services were called. Blood and urine
cultures were sent.

Patient was given 4L IVF for volume rescucitation and 2u PRBCs
for concern of GIB. He was started on Protonix drip, and he was
treated empirically with vancomycin and Zosyn for sepsis of
unclear etiology ?urinary source vs pneumonia. Ultimately, as
the patient remained hypotensive, a groin line was placed and
norepinephrine started. Vitals at time of admission were HR 90,
BP 129/60, RR 25, satting 100% on RA.

Of note, the patient had started Keflex on [**12-3**] for urinary
tract infection, per his son.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: currently patient is without nausea or
abdominal pain. He denies recent diarrhea. He does endorses
recent dysuria and abdominal pain yesterday, as outlined above
in HPI. ROS otherwise is non-focal: patient denies cardiac or
pulmonary symptoms.

EKG ([**2161-12-12**]):
Normal sinus rhythm with right bundle-branch block and secondary
ST-T wave
abnormalities. Left atrial abnormality. Compared to the previous
tracing
of [**2161-2-5**] no diagnostic interim change.
.
pCXR ([**2161-12-12**]):
Increased opacities at the right hemithorax, greater at the lung

base, could represent aspiration, developing pneumonia, or
possibly asymmetric pulmonary edema.
.
CT Abdomen and Pelvis ([**2161-12-12**]):
1. Extensive bladder wall irregularity, as above, representing
either
cystitis or possibly neoplasm. Further workup with cystoscopy is
recommended.
Small foci of air either within or adjacent to the urinary
bladder wall are
likely related to prior Foley catheter placement, less likely
due to
emphysematous cystitis.
2. Diffuse diverticulosis without diverticulitis.
3. No evidence of small-bowel obstruction or small bowel
ischemia, however,
evaluation is limited secondary to lack of IV or oral contrast.
4. Stable liver and renal cysts.
5. Stable focal abdominal aorta aneurysm at the [**Female First Name (un) 899**] origin.
6. R>L lower lobe opacities likely represent atelectasis, but
pneumonia
cannot be completely excluded.
7. Stable right pleural calcified plaque, which may be
postinfectious,
posthemorrhagic, or from prior asbestos exposure.
.
Interval Results:
.
CXR ([**2161-12-13**]):
In comparison with the study of [**12-12**], there is little overall
change. Opacification at the right base again could reflect
aspiration or
developing pneumonia. Pleural calcification at the right base is
consistent with a calcified fibrothorax. There is enlargement of
the cardiac silhouette without definite pleural effusion or
pulmonary vascular congestion. Intact midline sternal wires are
in place.
