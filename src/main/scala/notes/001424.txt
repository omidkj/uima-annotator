History of Present Illness:
Source: Family, olds notes (pt non-verbal).
.
CC: Dyspnea
.
HPI: Ms. [**Known lastname 108496**] 78 yo F w/ end stage Parkinsons-like syndrome
presenting to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED with SOB/tachypnea. Her daughter
reports that the patient was in her usual state of health until
the day of presentation when according to her regular VNA she
was found in her wheelchair with sob/tachypnea. Her daughter was
called and came and gave her Lasix 20mg with little improvement.
Over the next 2 hours, the daughter describes the patient as
becoming increasingly anxious, which is reportedly similar to
her behaviour when experiencing pain. Pt has limited mobility at
baseline, with Parkinsonian cogwheel rigidity, and is in a
wheelchair. Per her daughter, she is able to respond to verbal
commands/questions, and can focus on the speaker, though in the
ED she was agitated and noncommunicative. Her daughter reports
that she has had a cough x 1day, though nonproductive. She has a
suction machine at home that the family uses occasional, as she
is s/p removal of her bottom teeth in [**12-22**].
.
In the ED, the patient was started on Ceftriaxone and
Azithromycin for pneumonia, and was diuresed with Lasix for
possible CHF. She was also sent for CT head given h/o recent
fall and inability to communicate. While waiting for admission
her BP dropped to 70s/30s and temp rose to 103.5F. She was given
4 liters of normal saline with recovery of her blood pressure to
the high 90's / 40's. The sepsis protocol was initiated but the
family refused placement of a central line.
.
ROS: + for limited mobility, with fall from wheelchair 6 days
ago, hitting head, no residual symptoms per family. She has also
had a right foot ulcer on heel x 3months, increased lethargy in
afternoon post Parkinson meds (by family report, pt sleeps for
up to 6 hours after receiving meds, they were concerned for
overmedication and held her afternoon doses today, she received
them in the ED).

XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
CT HEAD [**8-6**]:  No evidence of intracranial hemorrhage.
XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
CXR [**8-6**]:  No change since [**2115-1-13**]. Elevated left
hemidiaphragm with associated minimal left basilar atelectasis
and a small right pleural effusion/thickening.
XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
LE U/S [**8-8**]:  No evidence of right lower extremity DVT.
XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
UE U/S [**8-11**]:  Patent internal jugular and subclavian veins
bilaterally.
XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
TTE [**8-13**]:  The left atrium is mildly dilated. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal.  Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets
are mildly thickened. There is moderate/severe mitral valve
prolapse. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The mitral
regurgitation jet is eccentric. There is moderate pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
CT [**8-24**]:  1. Moderate-sized left pleural effusion, containing
heterogeneous increased signal throughout. Findings suspicious
for hemothorax. This could be related to the chest tube, as
there is increased density fluid surrounding the chest tube tip.
No evidence of abdominal or retroperitoneal hematoma.  2.
Probable left renal cyst
XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
RENAL U/S [**8-31**]:  Atrophic right kidney. Simple left renal cyst.
No evidence of hydronephrosis
XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
CXR [**9-5**]:  Moderate sized bilateral pleural effusion with mild
pulmonary edema. More intense opacification in the lower lungs
could be a combination of edema and atelectasis as well as a
fissural and costodiaphragmatic pleural effusion, but pneumonia
cannot be excluded. No central venous line is seen. Tracheostomy
tube is in standard placement. There is no appreciable
pneumothorax, but a small pleural air collection might not be
appreciated, particularly since the patient is supine.


Brief Hospital Course:
MICU Course:
Patient [**Hospital 32805**] transferred to MICU for hypoxia secondary to
aspiration PNA which was treated but still difficult to wean
patient off ventilator.  Patient then developed a presumed VAP
and was treated with a 14 day course of Zosyn/vancomycin.  After
treatment of PNA patient initially improved on ventilator and
felt that respiratory distress was secondary to pulmonary
congestion.  Patient was started on lasix gtt to remove fluid.
Patient was extubated however after extubation patient did not
look good from respiratory standpoint.  Chest xray showed left
pleural effusion which was felt could be contributing to
patient'd respiratory distress.  Patient underwent thoracentesis
under U/S which drew back 20cc of blood and was aborted.  After
thoracentesis patient became very tachypneic and decision made
to re-intubate after only 2 days s/p extubation.  Later that day
after thoracentesis patient became hypotensive and was found to
have 10 point Hct drop and increased left lung opacity on CXR.
Thoracic surgery called and chest tube placed which produced
about 1L of serosanginous fluid.  Patient required total 9 units
of PRBC and Hct stabalized after 3 days.  CT scan showed that
blood was still present in pleural space even with chest tube in
place so patient underwent trial of TPA through chest tube to
break up any clots in pleural space.  After 3 rounds of TPA and
repeat CT scan decision made for patient to un
