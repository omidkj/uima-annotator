Chief Complaint:
dyspnea

History of Present Illness:
48 year-old gentleman with severe COPD (2-5L home O2), CHF and
multiple lengthy prior admissions. Initially presented to OSH
with 2-3 weeks increased SOB and cough productive of
yellow/whote sputem but signed out AMA. Admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] MICU
on [**7-7**] with COPD flare and treated with solumedrol, nebs,
cefodoxine/azithromycin, and diuretics. Called out from MICU but
then taken back to MICU due to increased dyspnea and tachypnea.
Intubated and extubated on [**7-14**]. Was net negative 15L across
MICU stays. Also received 7-day course of vanc/zosyn for HAP.
At time of transfer patient was stable. Per ICU patient is still
volume overloaded and needs further diuresis. Patient would be
appropriate for transfer to LTAC bed after the weekend.
On the floor pt was not in any acute distress, lying in a
reclining position, and requesting to go home tomorrow. When
asked why he said "to smoke". Vitals were stable. Patient was
tolerating regular diet without N/V.

MRSA SCREEN: POSITIVE FOR MRSA

<B> IMAGING: </B>

CXR [**2145-7-17**]: Comparison is made to the prior study from [**2145-7-16**].
Patient is rotated. The endotracheal tube has been removed.
Right IJ catheter terminates in the superior vena cava. Heart is
enlarged. Patient is status post CABG. There is patchy
consolidation of both lower lobes. There is also underlying
congestive failure, unchanged from prior study. There is a small
right pleural effusion, unchanged since the prior study.
.
EGD [**2145-7-10**]: Old blood in stomach, small amounts diffusely, no
active bleeding. Likely blood from trauma from intubation.
Otherwise normal EGD to second part of the duodenum.

Echo ([**7-7**]) - The left and right atra are moderately dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal

cavity size and global systolic function (LVEF>55%). Due to
suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality
cannot be fully excluded. The right ventricular cavity is
moderately dilated with mild global free wall hypokinesis. There

is abnormal septal motion/position suggestive of right
ventricular volume overload. The diameters of aorta at the
sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. A bileaflet aortic
valve prosthesis is present. The aortic valve prosthesis appears

well seated, with normal leaflet/disc motion and transvalvular
gradients. No aortic regurgitation is seen. ?Moderate (2+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the
severity of mitral regurgitation may be significantly
UNDERestimated.] There is mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Technically suboptimal study. Mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global biventricular
systolic function. Right ventricular cavity enlargement with
free wall hyopokinesis. Normal functioning aortic valve
prosthesis. ?Moderate mitral regurgitation.
If clinically indicated, a TEE would be better able to define
the severity of mitral regurgitation.


Brief Hospital Course:
## Dyspnea - The patient's chief complaint on admission was
dyspnea.  It was felt that this dyspnea was consistent with a
CHF exacerbation.  Although, based on his lung exam with
wheezing and rhonchi, it was felt that there was also a COPD
component to the patient's dyspnea.  DFA for flu was negative;
urinary legionella antigen was also negative.  Over the course
of his initial ICU stay, he was treated with IV solumedrol,
nebs, and cepodoxime/azithromycin for COPD flare. He was also
diuresed with lasix 120mg iv prn, though he autodiuresed
aggressively on his own. He was transfered to the medical floor
on the evening of [**2145-7-10**].

Around midnight of that day, he was noted to have increased
agitation. He was then noted to become hypoxic and tachypneic.
He was evaluated by the floor team and noted to have diffuse
crackles without significant wheezing.  He was given lasix but
remained tachypneic low oxygen sats.  A CXR revealed bilateral
opacification consistent pulmonary edema or new LUL infiltrate.

Additionally, he was visibly oozing from his left face wound,
his nose, and his lower extremity chronic venous stasis ulcers.


.
At this point, he was transferred back to the MICU. Upon arrival

to the MICU, he appeared uncomfortable and tachypneic. Upon
placement of BiPaP, he became acutely more uncomfortable,
sitting forward, pursed lip breathing. The decision was made to
intubate him.  He was treated as a flash pulmonary edema case;
he also completed a 7 day course of vanco/zosyn for possible
hospital acquired pneumonia.
.
The patient remained intubated for 4 days, during which time he
was diuresed with lasix.  Eventually, on [**2145-7-14**], he was able to
be extubated.  In the days following his extubation, he still
appeared to be fluid overloaded.  Therefore, he continued to be
diuresed aggressively.  Over this time, he reported that his
dyspnea was improving.  On [**2145-7-17**], the patient was transferred
from the unit to the medical floor. On the floor he was
continued to be diuresed and his respiratory status continued to

improve. By the time of admission his oxygen requirement had
decreased to his baseline regimen of 2L NC. We increased his
home dose of lasix for discharge to the rehabilitation facility
and recommended strict daily weights.
.
Finally, based on his anatomy and observing
