hypertension, HTN, HLD, on coumadin (h/o A fib and DVTs) who
presented initially to the ED with some new shortness of breath,
fatigue, mild confusion and back pain. Most of the history comes
from the patient's daughter who reports that the patient's
weight has remained stable (now 183-184), he is taking his
torsemide TID, his lower extremity edema is much improved from
prior. He appears to be working hard to breathe which she says
is also stable for many months. However, he has appeared more
uncomfortable, his attention had been worse and he has been
complaining of worsening back pain for one week. She gave him a
dose of flexeril on Sunday and he became confused and lethargic.

.
In the ED, intial vitals: 79 106/70 24 97% on RA. Per report he
appeared tachypneic, retracting, looking generally unwell. Labs
notable for creatinine 2.2 (baseline 1.7-2.0), INR 4.0, troponin
0.05, and positive U/A. Had epigastric pain and CT Abdomen
pelvis was done that showed: Unchanged large bilat pleural
effusions
Stable renal cysts w/ thin calc septations. Trace simple FF in
pelvis + SQ edema- prob vol overload. No RP hematoma. Mult

cipro. He felt better after lasix, put out about 100cc urine. On
transfer, VS 88 109/96 23 98% on RA.
.
On the floor overnight he was initially stable, but became
increasingly short of breath around 730AM. He was breathing
around 30 time per minute with obvious retractions and accessory
muscle use. He was unable to speak more than single words and
was clearly tiring. A trigger was called and the CCU team
evaluated him. An initial gas was 7.34 / 61 / 124 on a facemask.
He was given Lasix 80mg IV x1, 2 inches of NTG paste, and given
nebs of albuterol and atrovent. His initial exam was notable for
a RA sat in the 70s, escalating tachypnea,virtually no air
movement, JVD to the angle of the jaw, and bilateral 2+ LE
edema. His CXR showed diffuse pulmonary edema. He was started on
a nitroglycerin drip, a Lasix drip, and pulsed with solumedrol
plus levofloxacin and transfered to the CVICU as soon as a bed
became available.
