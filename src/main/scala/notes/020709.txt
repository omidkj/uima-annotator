Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1828**]
Chief Complaint:
Fever

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
HD line removal

History of Present Illness:
62 yo F with PMH of ESRD on HD, DM, diastolic CHF, history of
multiple line infections who presents with fevers from rehab.
Patient reports she was in her usual state of health. For last
couple weeks has been having mid-flank back pain. Per patient
not further evaluated at rehab as attributed to muscle pain.
Reports decreased appetite last several days. Patient went for
regular HD today where she reported chills. T99.9 at HD and
later spiked to 100.8 and referred to ED for further evaluation.

.
In the ED, her vitals were rectal temp 38.9, SBP 60s, HR 116.
She complained of her chronic back pain and some mild abdominal
pain. A foley was placed and frank green pus came out per report
from the ED. She was given 4L NS with initial lactate of 2.4.
Blood cultures and urine culture was sent. Patient was initially
given levo, flagyl and vanc and then was given cefepime to cover
for pseudomonas given green pus. They tried to place a left IJ
but could not thred the wire. The patient refused a femoral CVL
and refused an aterial line per the ED report. Patient was to
have a CT abdomen/pelvis to evaluate for abscess prior to
admission to ICU.
.
Currently, she reports of mild bitemporal HA, but no back or
abdominal pain. During interview developed throbbing r-flank
pain again, non-radiating, no nausea/vomitting, +constipation -
but just had BM, no change in vision, SOB, c/p. normally anuric
but with occasionaly UOP. noted that her abdominal
pain/constipation improved with urine output this AM. Chronic LE
ulcers - pain controlled and wounds appear to be improving. c/o
thirst at this time.

Pertinent Results:
[**2136-6-7**]

CTU IMPRESSION:
1. No acute intra-abdominal process.
2. Multiple bilateral nonobstructing renal stones.
3. Fibroid uterus, with prominent ovaries bilaterally, largely
changed from as far back as [**2127**].
4. Unusual appearance of the right common femoral vessels, with
asymmetric enhancement of the right common femoral vein relative
to the left. This raises the suspicion for whether there is an
underlying AV malformation in this area.
5. Marked stool impaction within the rectum with stable
circumferential rectal wall thickening of unclear etiology.

[**2136-6-8**]
The left atrium is moderately dilated. Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are
normal (LVEF 70%) There is no ventricular septal defect. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic root is moderately dilated at the sinus level. The
ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic arch is mildly
dilated. There are focal calcifications in the aortic arch. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. No masses or vegetations are seen on
the aortic valve. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. No
vegetation/mass is seen on the pulmonic valve. There is no
pericardial effusion.

Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed)
of [**2136-2-15**], the findings are similar.

IMPRESSION: no obvious vegetations seen

[**2136-6-8**]
RIGHT UPPER EXTREMITY NON-VASCULAR ULTRASOUND: The hemodialysis
catheter is visualized but no abscess or fluid collection is
seen in the surrounding tissues.

Brief Hospital Course:
62F with PMH ESRD on HD with history of multiple line
infections, now with bacteremia and acute bacterial cystitis


# Staph Aureus bacteremia: [**6-22**] blood cultures with GPCs in
clusters, all speciated to coag + staph aureus
-vancomycin dosing was performed by levels with dialysis
-TTE had no evidence vegetations
-Her HD line was removed on [**6-8**] and left out for a "line
holiday" until Tuesday [**6-12**]
-Because of persistent complaints of back pain, an MRI of the
spine was ordered.  This revealed findings consistent with
osteomyelitis at the T9 Vertebrae.  This obligates her to
receive a 6 week course of antibiotics.
-The infectious disease service consulted and agreed with plan
of care, but noted that the MIC to vancomycin for her isolate
was rising.  I.D. thus made very explicit recommendations re:
vancomycin dosing to occur with every hemodialysis, so as to
maintain trough levels above 20.

# Acute bacterial cystitis: E. coli on culture, sensitivities
showing resistance to multiple agents, including ciprofloxacin.

-cefepime was given, and then changed to ceftriaxone, and she
completed a 7 day course.
-Per urology recs: instilled bladder with NS flushes during the
first 5 days of therapy.

# Hypotension: She is known to medical service as having low
cuff pressure readings despite normal mentation/ UOP.  Her blood
pressures normalized with treatment of infection, remaining in
the range of 90-100 systolic

# ESRD on HD
-As dialysis was held off during the line holiday, she was on a
fluid restriction.  The nephrology service followed her course
and she did well, tolerating dialysis well when it was
reinstituted.

# Leg ulcers:
-A wound care consultation made recommendations for local
management, but felt her wounds were improving.  She received
daily
