Chief Complaint:
s/p fall with R hip fracture

Endotracheal intubation
Right hip hemiarthroplasty

History of Present Illness:
Pt s/p CVA wheelchair bound. Yesterday, while repositioning self
in wheelchair, she slipped out of chair and landed on buttock.
Pt does not appear to have lost consciousness. The following day
in the nursing home she was c/o R hip pain, guarding her R hip
with shortened R leg and externally rotated. XRay of hip done at
nursing home. Pt transferred to [**Hospital1 **] for further evaluation of R
hip fracture and found to be in RAF upon arrival to ED. In ED
received 3L NS for BP 86/71, levaquin 500mg IV X1 and flagyl
500mg IV X1.
.
Pt unable to answer questions, unable to assess for ROS.
.
XRay at NH results showed: Pelvis--no acute fracture or
dislocation. No bony erosions or destructive changes.   R Hip--
fracture deformity of the R hip, however cannot elucidate
whether acute or chronic. Suggest further evaluation of
fracture/deformity of R hip.

STUDIES:
.
HIP 1 VIEW:
RIGHT HIP, SINGLE AP VIEW.
There is a very unusual appearance to the right proximal femur,
with disruption of [**Last Name (un) 42445**] line (cortex along medial femoral
head and neck). This finding is highly suggestive of a
subcapital fracture, particularly in light of the abnormality on
the true lateral view obtained earlier today.
.
Bilateral Hips(AP & Lat).
IMPRESSION: Osteopenia. Probable right femoral neck fracture,
not optimally demonstrated here due to rotation on AP view.
.
CHEST, SINGLE AP VIEW.
There is mild-to-moderate cardiomegaly. The aorta is calcified
and slightly tortuous. There is upper zone redistribution,
without overt CHF. No focal infiltrate or effusion is
identified. Osteopenia, degenerative changes, and mild scoliosis
of the thoracic spine are noted. Multiple rounded densities
overlie the spleen -- ? splenic granulomas. Bilateral carotid
artery calcifications noted. There is persistent prominence of
the right paratracheal soft tissues, most likely representing
vascular ectasia in a patient of this age.
.
Portable CXR:
IMPRESSION: Upper zone redistribution, without overt CHF. No
pneumonia. Attention to the right paratracheal soft tissues on a
true AP view is recommended when the patient is stable. I
suspect this represents age-related variation in this
individual.
.
Head CT w/o contrast:
IMPRESSION:
1. Remote left middle cerebral artery territorial infarction.
2. No intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect.
.

Brief Hospital Course:
80 yo F w/MMP s/p Fall now w/R hip fracture.
Pt admitted to medical team on [**2169-12-18**] for management of
multiple medical problems & pre-operative evaluation prior to
having R hip fracture fixed by orthopedics.  Her elevated INR on
coumadin was corrected with vitamin K.  Pt was deemed to be
DNR/DNI, but in discussion with her health-care proxy, it was
decided to reverse this for surgical fixation of hip. Pt was
deemed medically optimized for surgery on [**2169-12-20**] & underwent R
hip hemiarthroplasty.  Intraoperatively pt became hypoxic &
hypotensive requiring pressors - transferred to SICU care.
Concern for fat emboli given sudden deterioration immediately
post-procedure.  Transesophageal echo performed demonstrating
dilated & hypokinetic RV, dilated atria. Pt was on heparin for
empiric anticoagulation, but was not candidate for
thrombolytics. CT angio demonstrating only small thrombus.
Continued to provide supportive care with ventilatory support &
pressors while discussing poor prognosis with family who stated
that pt would not want to live in a severely debilitated
condition.  The decision to pursue comfort measures only was
made by [**Hospital **] health care proxy on [**2169-12-22**] in discussion with
the orthopedic & sicu attendings; the patient was declared dead
later that afternoon.
