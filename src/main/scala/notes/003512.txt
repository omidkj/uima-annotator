Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5790**]
Chief Complaint:
Recurrent right pleural effusion

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2115-6-20**] Right pleural effusion drainage with pigtail placement
and talc pleurodesis


History of Present Illness:
[**Known lastname 34440**] is a 54 year-old woman whp is s/p R VATS
decortication, mechanical pleurodesis, and doxycycline chemical
pleurodesis for recurrent effusion/trapped lung on [**2115-6-7**].  The
pathology was benign.  I suspect the etiology of the effusion
was cardiac (valvular) + previous chest radiation. Unfortunately
she developed recurrent dry cough, chest pain, SOB 3 days ago.
She has some wheezing.  She denies fevers, chills, or sweats.


Past Medical History:

nausea, vomiting)

Imaging:
CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2115-6-25**] 8:26 PM:
Small multiloculated right pleural effusion has increased over
the course of the day, not as large as it was on [**6-23**]. Tiny
volume of pleural air at the base of the right lung is stable.
Basal and apical pleural tube are unchanged in their respective
positions. There is appreciably greater congestion and possibly
mild edema in the right lung now than earlier in the day.
Moderate-to-severe cardiomegaly is stable. Minimal left
perihilar edema has also developed. Tip of the new Swan-Ganz
catheter projects over the bifurcation of the pulmonary
arteries. ET tube in standard placement, transvenous right
atrial and right ventricular pacer leads unchanged in standard
placements as well.

RUQ U/S:
Normal son[**Name (NI) 493**] appearance of the kidneys bilaterally.
Prominent fluid-containing structure with internal debris in the
left upper quadrant may represent gastric contents versus
pleural effusion with heterogeneous internal debris,
incompletely evaluated. Further imaging can be performed if
indicated.

TTE [**2115-6-25**]:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Tissue Doppler imaging
suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure
(PCWP>18mmHg). The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated
with borderline normal free wall function. There is abnormal
septal motion/position. The aortic valve is abnormal. The aortic
valve is not well seen. Moderate (2+) aortic regurgitation is
seen. Mild to moderate ([**2-8**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate [2+]
tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is a trivial/physiologic
pericardial effusion. There are no echocardiographic signs of
tamponade.

CT CHEST W/CONTRAST Study Date of [**2115-6-21**] 4:18 PM
1. Persistent large multiloculated right pleural effusion. New
loculated
hydropneumothoraces are likely related to pleural catheter
placement.
2. New high attenuation along diaphragmatic pleural region,
probably
representing talc deposition given history of interval talc
treatment.
3. Improving left lower lobe opacity which may be due to
resolving area of
infection or inflammation.
4. Septal thickening, probably reflecting hydrostatic edema, but
attention to this area on followup CT may be helpful to exclude
lymphangitic
carcinomatosis


Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 34440**] was a very pleasant 54 year-old female who
unfortunately was readmitted for recurrent right pleural
effusion following a right VATS decortication,
mechanical/doxycycline pleurodesis .  Her chest CT showed an
increase of the right-sided pleural effusion, partially
divided/organized in two major compartments.  Her coumadin was
held on admission.
.
On [**6-20**]/009 she underwent placement of a pigtail catheter and
talc pleurodesis by IR.  She received 2u FFP periprocedure.
Pigtail was inserted without complications, 1350cc of straw
colored fluid was drained.  Post-procedure CXRs showed continued
right pleural effusion.  Her WBC was elevated, which we
attributed to the talc pleurodesis, as she was otherwise w/o
signs or symptoms of infection.  It quickly became evident that
the pigtail placed was too small in diameter for adequate
drainage of this multiloculated effusion and that she would need
a repeat R VATS decortication with placement of a pleurx
catheter.
.
On [**2115-6-22**] patient developed tachycardia with rates to the 150s
and a drop in SBPs to 90-80s.  The rhythm initially appe
