History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 85 yo female with PMH of CAD s/p CABG, CHF who
was in USOH until 1 week ago when she started experiencing cough
and sob. She states that over the course of the week she
experienced progressing shortness of breath and chills. She
states that on the day PTA, she lost her balance and fell and
lay there as she was unable to make it to the phone for about 6
hours. Her daughter found her.  The next day, her daughter found
her to be febrile to 103 and brought her to [**Location (un) 20026**]
Hospital.
.
Initially, on admission to NWH, she was febrile but
normotensive.  CXR revealed both PNA and fluid overload.  BNP
1099.  LENI's of her lower extremities were performed due to
complaint of calf pain with ambulation; both extremities
negative for DVT.  She was given Lasix 40 mg IV, and her BP
dropped to 60's and she was started on dopamine.  She also was
treated with Vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and azithromycin. She was
placed on NRB for her oxygentation and heparin gtt in the
setting of elevated troponins (TropI to 0.9) and transferred to
[**Hospital1 18**] for further care.
.
On arrival to the [**Hospital1 18**] ER, she had a head CT and CXR and
started on CPAP prior to her transfer to the MICU.  At this
time, she reported that her shortness of breath was improving.
She denied chest pain,  and ROS revealed only one loose BM per
day for the past 1 week.
.
In the MICU, she required mask ventilatory support and Levophed
for BP support.  A right subclavian CVL and left A-line were
placed.  Levophed was quickly titrated off, and she was
transferred to the general medicine service on 4L NC for further
care.

 Mentating at baseline, per daughter.

Pertinent Results:
EKG - nsr, left axis, rbbb with lafb, no sig changes compared to
previous.
.
[**12-17**] - CXR: Mild cardiomegaly.  Increased opacities in
bilateral lower lobes, especially on the right with effusion and
atelectasis.  Increased vascular markings in upper lobes.  These
findings can be explained worsening CHF, however, there is a
possibility of right lower lobe pneumonia.
.
Head CT - Chronic small vessel ischemia.  No evidence of
hemorrhage.
.
[**12-18**] Echo:
1. The left atrium is moderately dilated. The left atrium is
elongated. The right atrium is markedly dilated.
2. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal  (LVEF>55%). [Intrinsic left
ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the
severity of valvular regurgitation.]
3.The right ventricular cavity is markedly dilated. There is
focal hypokinesis of the apical free wall of the right
ventricle. Right ventricular systolic function appears
depressed. There is abnormal septal motion/position consistent
with right ventricular pressure/volume overload.
4.The ascending aorta is moderately dilated.
5.The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trace aortic
regurgitation is seen.
6.The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate (2+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. The mitral regurgitation jet is
eccentric.
7.Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
8.There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
9.There is no pericardial effusion. There is an anterior space
which most
likely represents a fat pad.
.
CXR [**2197-12-20**]:
1.  Marked worsening of pulmonary edema.
2.  Worsening of bibasilar consolidation, which may be due to an
infectious process or aspiration.
.
TTE [**2197-12-22**]:
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal
cavity size and systolic function (LVEF>55%). Regional left
ventricular wall motion is normal. The right ventricular cavity
is moderately dilated. There is mild global right ventricular
free wall hypokinesis. There is abnormal septal motion/position.
There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.  Compared with the prior study
(images reviewed) of [**2197-12-18**], the degree of tricuspid
regurgitation and pulmonary hypertension are less. The RV is
still dilated and hypokinetic.
.
CXR [**2197-12-23**]
Persistent pulmonary edema.
Bilateral pleural effusions. The slight interval increase in the
left-sided pleural effusion may be attributable to differences
in patient positioning.
.
CXR [**2197-12-27**]
Compared with [**2197-12-23**], the posterior left pleural effusion
appears grossly unchanged. No significant increase is seen
involving the much smaller right pleural effusion.
The right lower lobe atelectasis/infiltrate is grossly
unchanged.

Brief Hospital Course:
85 year old woman with h/o CHF, CAD s/p CABG admitted with
pneumonia & CHF exacerbation.
.
1. Pneumonia: Likely community acquired PNA. She has been
treated with azithromycin, vancomycin, and ceftriaxone;
vancomycin d/c'd after 7 days as patient is low-risk for
nosocomial MRSA pneumonia.  Gram stain and sputum cultures
unrevealing.  Influenza DFA negative.  She completed a 10d of
Cef/Azithro.  She required supplement O2 at discharge to
maintain SpO2>92% (she was down to 1.5L).  This should continue
to be titrated down.  After completing her treatment, she
remained afebrile.
.
2. CHF:  Patient with known h/o CHF.  Echo performed during this
hospital course show RV dysfunction and dilation (see ECHO
reports). Abnormal septal motion/position was felt to be
consistent with RV pressure/volume overload. This pulm HTN was
not new as she had previously PA HTN from prior to CABG in [**2196**]
and in [**6-/2197**] - per ECHO done by her primary cardiologist. LVEF
normal.  It is possible that cause of RV failure is acute
pulmonary disease; however, the differential diagnosis includes
PE vs. ischemic disease.  She had positive trops, but only
mildly elevated without EKG changes and thus was felt to be
demand related.  At [**Hospital1 18**], our goal for her was for a negative
fluid balance, particularly in the setting of worsened pulmonary
edema on most recent CXR. After coming off pressors and transfer
to floor, the patient was aggressively diuresed with 40mg [**Hospital1 **] IV
of lasix. We diuresed her with a goal of -2L per day.  She still
required oxygen upon discharge, but with continued diuresis,
this should be able to be weaned down.  She was discharged on
Lasix 80mg PO BID; Once she is euvolemic and no longer requiring
oxygen, she should be switched back to her home dose of Lasix
40mg po daily.  She should have repeat electrolytes on [**1-1**]
to ensure her kidney function is stable.  She should follow up
with her cardiologist in the next 1-2 weeks and have a repeat
echocardiogram at that time once she is euvolemic.  Initially
held BB & [**Last Name (un) **] in the setting of hypotension and ?seps
