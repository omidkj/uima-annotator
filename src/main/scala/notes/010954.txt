Brief Hospital Course:
61 year old man with a past medical history of spontaneous
pneumothorax [**2155**] and bullous emphysema presenting with
complaints of dyspnea for several weeks consistent with COPD
exacerbation. He was treated with bronchodilators, steroids, and
azithromycin. CTA chest showed no evidence of pulmonary
embolism.  On the floor, he developed hypercarbic respiratory
failure. He was placed on BiPAP and transferred to the MICU.
There, he was rapidly weaned off BiPAP. He was treated with a 14
day prednisone taper along with a 7 day course of azithromycin.
Patient was counseled regarding the importance of smoking
cessation and a nicotine patch daily. He will need close
pulmonary followup and home oxygenation. The patient had clear
evidence of cor pulmonale in setting of long-standing severe
COPD. His severely overloaded RV compromised LV filling, and
therefore likely contributing to poor exercise tolerance and
pulmonary edema. He was diuresed with lasix and started on
digoxin with good effect. He was discharged on PO lasix and will
require regular volume status monitoring following discharge.
He was also started on a low dose ace-inhibitor, digoxin, and
asa. In regards to his lower extremity wounds, sustained at home
from a space heater, they did not appear infected. These were
managed with topical treatments recommended by the wound care
nurse.
