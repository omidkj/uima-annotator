HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 78-year-old
male with a history of MI times two, CABG in [**2186**], peripheral
vascular disease, now presenting from an outside hospital for
investigation of two transient episodes of left-side
hemiparesis.  According to the patient, he awoke on Saturday,
[**2188-6-21**] at 5:30 a.m. and could not move his entire left
side of body including leg and foot for a half an hour.

The patient reports that approximately two to three hours later,
while sitting on an armchair, felt the sudden onset of the same
left-sided weakness for 15-30 minutes.  The patient called his
wife who called EMS.  By the time they had arrived, the patient's
strength had returned.  The patient arrived to the ER at [**Hospital 882**]
Hospital where a head CT was negative.  The hospital gave him
Aggrenox post aspirin and he was transferred to
[**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation.

At [**Hospital1 18**], the patient was admitted to the Neurology Service
for workup of TIA and stroke.  On initial imaging, the MRI
showed no abnormalities on DWI. However, the study did show
periventricular white matter signal changes most likely secondary
to small vessel disease. On MRA there was evidence of decreased
flow of left vertebral artery.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the General
Medical Floor for further workup including carotid ultrasound
and transthoracic echocardiogram, both within normal limits;
however, on the day of admission at 9:00, the patient had an
episode of coffee ground emesis.  The patient was kept
n.p.o., given IV fluids with NG tube to low suction.  The
patient continued to have 900 cc of coffee ground emesis.
The GI service was consulted and upper esophageal gastric
duodenoscopy that showed grade III esophagitis and gastritis.
The patient's CBC was monitored throughout the admission.  The
patient's hematocrit decreased from 28 to 33 after two days of
admission. He was therefore was transfused 1 unit of packed red
blood cells.  The patient's hematocrit stabilized at 36 prior to
discharge.

Because of his risk factors for stroke it was discussed what
would be his best anti-platetel regimen, in the setting of GI
bleed. Both GI and Neurology Services agreed that the patient
will tolerate aspirin 325 mg enteric coated and Protonix p.o. for
four to six weeks. At that time, he will have a repeat esophageal
duodenoscopy as an outpatient. After this study, a decision will
be made by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 14506**], the patient's primary care physician,
[**Name10 (NameIs) **] add on Aggrenox for stroke prophylaxis.
