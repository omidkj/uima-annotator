Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 165**]
Chief Complaint:
Transfer from OSH for cath
SOB, Chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac Catheterization [**2170-7-12**]
off-pump CABGx2 (LIMA>LAD, SVG>Diag) [**2170-7-13**]


History of Present Illness:
53 y/o M with T2DM, hyperlipidemia, hypertension and known CAD,
s/p 3 x 18mm Cypher stent to D1 and 2.5 x 18 mm Cypher stent to
OM1 in 7/[**2168**]. He also is status post shoulder surgery recently
complicated by a DVT in the right lower leg (3/[**2170**]). He was
transferred here to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2170-5-15**] after being admitted to [**Hospital1 **]
[**Location (un) 620**] for chest pain and dyspnea. He ruled out for a MI but
underwent cardiac catheterization where he was found to have 95%
lesion in the D2, 60% mid LAD lesion, 60% prox LAD, and a 45%
proximal RCA. He subsequently underwent successful, complicated
Cullotte stenting of the LAD and D2. It was suggested that
because it was such a complicated stenting that a relook in [**3-27**]
months would not be unreasonable. He was admitted to [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**]
on [**2170-7-9**] with complaints of shortness of breath and chest pain
for three days. He also reported vomiting in the am on occasion.
He reports being symptom free for ~3 months after prior cath,
has been having [**8-2**] crushing chest pain with walking [**1-24**] block
(could walk 3.5 miles previously) associated with SOB. Has also
been having pain now with rest. Subsides in 15 minutes without
intervention. + PND, + chronic LE swelling, no orthopnea.
At [**Hospital1 **] Neeham he had an ultrasound of his leg but recurrent DVT
was not seen. He ruled out for a MI. He underwent echocardiogram
which demonstrated an EF of 55-60%, a mildly dilated LA, normal
sized LV with nl function, normal valves. He had one episode of
CP 2 days prior to transfer treated successfully with 1Sl NTG.
He is transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] transferred for a relook cardiac
catheterization. This patient is noted by his nurse to be
intermittently incontinent for no apparent reason. He is legally
blind and lives alone. Apparently on discharge in [**2170-4-24**] he
was extremely resistent to having even one visit by a visiting
nurse. He will need to be transitioned to coumadin and may
benefit from social service referral to encourage home service
involvement.
