Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1928**]
Chief Complaint:
Abdominal pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
ERCP with sphincterotomy and biliary stent placement on [**2157-2-1**]

History of Present Illness:
Mrs. [**Known firstname 1929**] [**Known lastname 1930**] is a very nice 85 year-old woman with a
history of cholecystectomy and ampullar stenosis who presents
with RUQ abdominal pain. She states her pain started 2 days
prior to admission, was constant and radiated towards the back.
She had nausea, vomit, malaise.  Denies fever, chills, changes
in her bowel movements, hematochezia or melena.  Unable able to
tolerate oral intake.

Presenting vitals were T 101.5, HR 68, BP 152/76, RR 16, SpO2
95% RA.  In ED, Unasyn 3gm given and a right IJ central line was
placed. She underwent ERCP that showed 1-cm stone in the common
bile duct. Patient became hypoxic from the conscious sedation,
so the stone was not removed to expedite the procedure. A
plastic biliary stent was successfully placed.  Post-ERCP, she
was admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of cholangitis.

ICU course:  In the ICU, the patient was continued on Zosyn, her
RUQ pain significantly improved, and she began to tolerate
fluids.  On [**2-3**], she developed shortness of breath that
improved with administration of furosemide.  Nebulizer
treatments also given.  At time of transfer to floor, O2 sat was
95% on 2L nasal canula.  Lisinopril restarted, but Atenolol and
Nifedipine held for concern of lower heart rate.

She was transferred to the floor and felt improvement in her
abdominal pain.  Denied shortness of breath, chest pain.

Past Medical History:
1. Hypertension
2. Ampullary stenosis
3. Status post cholecystectomy for gallstones
4. History of sphincterotomy (as described above)
5. Osteoporosis

Blood Culture [**2-3**]: No growth to date

Imaging:
CT Abdomen and Pelvis [**2157-2-1**]:
1. Stable pneumobilia and proximal biliary dilatation.
2. Left adnexal lesion, 2.6 cm. Recommend ultrasound for further

characterization, and to exclude a solid lesion/cyst with mural
nodule in this postmenopausal woman.

ERCP [**2157-2-1**]:
Findings: Esophagus: Limited exam of the esophagus was normal
Stomach: Limited exam of the stomach was normal
Duodenum: Limited exam of the duodenum was normal
Major Papilla: Evidence of a previous wide open sphincterotomy
was noted in the major papilla. Pus was noted at the ampulla.
Cannulation:  Cannulation of the biliary duct was successful and
deep using a free-hand technique. Contrast medium was injected
resulting in complete opacification.

Biliary Tree: A single 15 mm stone that was causing partial
obstruction was seen at the lower third of the common bile duct.
The bile duct was dilated to 15 mm. The rest of the biliary tree
was normal. Detailed cholangiogram was not obtained due to
suspicion of cholangitis.
Procedures: A 5cm by 10FR Double pig-tail biliary stent was
placed successfully.

Impression: S/P sphincterotomy - this was widely patent.
Pus noted at the ampulla.
Stone at the lower third of the common bile duct, dilation of
bile duct to 15 mm, other normal biliary tree.
A double pig-tail stent was placed in the bile duct.

Otherwise normal ercp to third part of the duodenum

TTE [**2-8**]
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The right atrial pressure is
indeterminate. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and
regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are
normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but
aortic stenosis is not present. No masses or vegetations are
seen on the aortic valve. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is
no mitral valve prolapse. No mass or vegetation is seen on the
mitral valve. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The
left ventricular inflow pattern suggests a restrictive filling
abnormality, with elevated left atrial pressure. The tricuspid
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is moderate pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. Significant pulmonic regurgitation
is seen. The end-diastolic pulmonic regurgitation velocity is
increased suggesting pulmonary artery diastolic hypertension.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
85 year-old woman presents with cholangitis [**12-21**]
choledocholithiasis s/p ERCP with biliary stent placement.
Gallstone was not removed because of the patient's tenous
condition.  The plan will be to repeat the ERCP in one month to
remove the stone.  Patient was also with bacteremia with E. Coli
and Enterococcus likely [**12-21**] biliary source.  Patient initially
on Zosyn, but because of thrombocytopenia was changed over to
Vanco and Cip
