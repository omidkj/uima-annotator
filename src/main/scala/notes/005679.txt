Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1505**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2168-3-1**] Mitral Valve Replacement (33mm St. [**Male First Name (un) 923**] Epic), Tricuspid
valve repair (32mm CE MC3 Ring)

History of Present Illness:
70 year old male with a history of mitral regurgitation,
paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and moderate pulmonary
hypertension who went to see his cardiologist on [**2167-12-17**] and
complained of becoming hoarse, short of breath, weak and
experiencing palpitations. In [**2163-7-7**] he had an episode of
paroxysmal atrial fibrillation for which he was admitted to
EMMC, and at that time he had an echocardiogram which showed
severe mitral regurgitation. He complains of a 12 pound wt gain
in 12 days, and 3+ bilateral ankle edema.  He went to see his
cardiologist and was prescribed Digoxin and Lasix, six days
after taken the medication his edema resolved and his weight was
back to his normal. Since the initiation of medications he
denies any further symptoms of weight gain or bilateral ankle
edema. He can walk up to two miles with experiencing shortness
of breath. Cardiac catheteterization showed ramus disease and
referred for surgery.

Pertinent Results:
[**2168-2-29**] Chest CT: 1. Minimal aortic arch calcification,
predominately at the arch. No aneurysmal dilatation. 2.
Cardiomegaly. 3. Coronary artery disease. 4. Liver and renal
hypodensities, likely cysts.

[**2168-3-2**] Echo: Prebypass: The left atrium is markedly dilated. No
spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body of the left atrium
or left atrial appendage. The right atrium is dilated. No
spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body of the right
atrium. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity is severely dilated. Regional left
ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 45-50%). [Intrinsic
left ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed
given the severity of valvular regurgitation.] Right ventricular
chamber size is normal with borderline normal free wall
function. [Intrinsic right ventricular systolic function is
likely more depressed given the severity of tricuspid
regurgitation.] The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Trace aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. The mitral valve leaflets are elongated. There is
moderate/severe posterior leaflet mitral valve prolapse. An
eccentric, anteriorly directed jet of severe (4+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. Due to the eccentric nature of the
regurgitant jet, its severity may be significantly
underestimated (Coanda effect). Tricuspid valve prolapse is
present. The tricuspid valve leaflets fail to fully coapt.
Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There
is no pericardial effusion.
Postbypass: The patient is on infusions of epinephrine and
nitroglycerin and is V-paced. There is a new bioprosthetic valve
which is well-seated in the mitral position. There is no
evidence of regurgitation or stenosis (peak gradient 4 mmHg with
a CO of 3.8 L/min). There is a new tricuspid valve annuloplasty
ring with no evidence of stenosis of regurgitation. Overall left
ventricular function is now moderately depressed (LVEF = 35-40%)
with paradoxical septal motion from V-pacing. The thoracic aorta
is intact.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 19704**] was a same day admit and on [**3-1**] underwent surgery
with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]. Please see operative report for surgical
details. Following surgery he was transferred to the CVICU in
stable condition on titrated epinephrine, nitroglycerin and
propofol drips. On post-op day one he was weaned from sedation,
awoke neurologically intact and extubated. Remained in CVICU for
management of his chronic atrial fibrillation and blood pressure
control but was transferred to the step-down floor later on
post-op day one. Coumadin was started on [**3-3**] with a Heparin
bridge. On post-op day three he had two self-limiting runs of VT
and was transferred back to the CVICU for closer telemetry
monitoring. EP was consulted and he had no further episodes of
VT. He had possible evidence of complete heart block with
question need for pacemaker but this was deemed not necessary by
EP. However they did recommend that he not be placed on beta
blockade.  He remained mostly bradycardic in atrial
fibrillation. Chest tubes and epicardial pacing wires were
removed per protocol. He returned to the step-down floor on
[**2168-3-9**]. During his post-op course he worked with physical
therapy for strength and mobility. His Coumadin was titrated to
a goal therapeutic INR of [**3-9**].5. EP advised patient to follow-up
with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in 2 weeks. He appeared suitable for
discharge home with VNA services on post-op day nine with the
appropriate medications and follow-up appointments. His PCP will
follow his INR and adjust Coumadin accordingly. Results from VNA
can be called to [**Telephone/Fax (1) 87820**], tha office of Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 87821**].  Per
the office of Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 87821**], he was referred to Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 87822**] office for cardiology follow-up and an appointment
was arranged.  By post-oerative day nine he was ready for
discharge to home.
