Chief Complaint:
hypoxia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 70 yo F presenting with a 4 day history of
lightheadness, fatigue, SOB, and cough.  She reports that she
was feeling in her normal state of health until monday when she
started to notice that she was lightheaded mostly when she was
walking or getting up.  Later that day she felt that she
"couldn't get enough air", only when she was sitting down.  She
also reports increased fatigue and a "hacking cough" with sputum
production.  Tuesday and Wedneday she reports no change in her
symptoms.  She went to see her PCP on Wednesday and was sent to
the ED because of decreased O2 sats.  She denies fevers or
chills.  The only recent sick contact was her husband who had a
"horrible cold" a few weeks ago.  She has been tolerating PO
intake.

The patient denies a history of heart disease, but is being
treated for "leg swelling".  Over the last few weeks she has
been waking up 1-2 times a week SOB in the middle of the night.
Sitting up relieves her symptoms.  She is able to walk up 1
flight of stairs without SOB.  She sleeps with 1 pillow
(unchanged).  She used to go for walks around her neighborhood
but stopped 4-5 months ago because of "balance problems".  She
denies ever having chest pain.

On arrival to ED, her vital signs were T 99.4 P100 BP 140/90 R24
O2 sat was not recorded but she was on 4L. She recieved
combivent and azithromycin in ED and felt better. Patietn still
desats to about 90% on RA within 2 minutes. She denies chest
pain/abdominal pain/nausea.

1. Rheumatoid arthritis
2. Cervical cancer status post hysterectomy in [**2146**]

4. Partial thyroidectomy
5. Hypertension

Pertinent Results:
Imaging:
[**2158-11-15**] CXR - No definite evidence of pneumonia. Leftward
deviation of the trachea raises suspicion of possible thyroid
goiter, although this finding is unchanged since the examination
of [**2153-9-28**].

[**2158-11-17**] CTA: 1. No pulmonary embolus.
2. Enlargement of the main pulmonary arteries, consistent with
pulmonary arterial hypertension.
3. Enlargement of the right lobe of the thyroid gland with
partially calcified thyroid nodule. This finding may be further
evaluated with thyroid ultrasound when the patient is clinically
able.
4. Emphysematous change.
5. Bilateral adrenal adenomas.

[**2158-11-17**]: LENI

[**2158-11-17**] Echo: The left atrium is normal in size. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular  hypertrophy. The left ventricular
cavity size is normal. Regional left  ventricular wall motion is
normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function  is normal
(LVEF 60-70%). No masses or thrombi are seen in the left
ventricle.  There is no ventricular septal defect. The right
ventricular free wall is  hypertrophied. The right ventricular
cavity is dilated. Right ventricular  systolic function is
borderline normal. There is abnormal systolic septal
motion/position consistent with right ventricular pressure
overload. The  aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally
normal with good leaflet  excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally  normal with trivial
mitral regurgitation. There is moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

[**2158-11-17**] abg XRAY: 1. Large amount of stool in the colon. No
evidence of obstruction.

[**2158-11-19**] MRI with contrast: Findings suggest noncommunicating
hydrocephalus. No evidence of mass lesion

[**2158-11-21**] Chest fluoro: No evidence for diaphragmatic
dysfunction.

2. Cardiomegaly, with mild congestive heart failure with
interstitial edema and small right pleural effusion.

3. Right superior mediastinal mass, likely due to goiter. Please
see recent CTA of [**2158-11-17**], which suggested ultrasound
for further assessment.

Brief Hospital Course:
70 yo F w/ PMH of RA (dx  on methotrexate), HTN, cervical CA
(s/p hysterectomy in [**2146**]), Partial thyroidectomy, who presented
with a 4 day history of lightheadness, fatigue, SOB, and
productive cough.  She reports that her symptoms began with
feeling lightheaded mostly when she was walking or getting up,
then later she felt that she "couldn't get enough air", even
when she was sitting down.  Her sob was accompanied by a cough
productive of green sputum.  Also c/o DOE and paroxysmal
nocturnal dyspnea.  She went to see her PCP and was sent to the
ED because of decreased O2 sats.   The only recent sick contact
was her husband who had a cold a few weeks ago.  On admission,
the pt had O2 sates of 80% on RA.  In ED given Solu-Medrol and
pt was started on azithromycin which was switched to levo for
empiric coverage of a potential CAP.  No interstitial edema or
infiltrate was seen on CXR on [**11-16**].  On the floor pt was
intermittently diuresed with Lasix 20 mg IV for possible CHF.
TTE on [**11-17**] revealed R sided RV dilatation and mod pulm HTN.
LENI failed to show DVT and CTA failed to reveal PE.
.
Pt was less arousable on transfer to the MICU on [**11-18**].  ABG
revealed significant resp acidosis.  An ABG showed 7.25/93/85
earlier in the day.  An ABG taken later when her O2sat was noted
to be in the high 70s on RA was 7.3/81/58.  A MICU referral was
then called.  It was felt pt had acute on chronic primary resp
acidosis given high serum bicarbs in past.  The pt was examined
to be ventilating well and then suddenly decompensate.  Pt was
tried on BIPAP in the MICU, but could not tolerate it. She had
one episode of desaturation to 78% on the evening of [**11-19**]. At
that time, she was slightly confused. CXR unchanged. ABG showed
worsening hypoxia. The patient spontaneously recovered from
this. She was started on progesterone to be used as a
respiratory stimulant. Levofloxacin
