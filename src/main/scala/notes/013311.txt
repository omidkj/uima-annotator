The patient has a subconjunctival hemorrhage in the left eye
from the coughing. Cough is productive of white, non-bloody
sputum. Pt also states "i had pneumonia 3 weeks ago, but I
handled it on my own." Patient does endorse increasing dyspnea
on exertion, and states that she uses several pillows and feels
that she has more
swelling in her legs than usual. The patient was on prednisone
for her LIP, but this was discontinued about 6-7 months ago. Pt

moderate relief. Pt then received HD. On return to the medical
floor, she develop severe left wrist pain--contralateral to her
original left shoulder pain. Plastics was consulted and
attempted drainage of the wrist with no success. MICU consulted
for worsened tachycardia (130 from admission HR of 110 which may
be her baseline) and worsening tachypnea. ABG surprisingly
7.36/48/86 despite tachypnea. At that time, pt reached her TMAX,
102.0. Shortly thereafter, 1 of 4 (anaerobic) bottles grew GPC.

HIDA [**2113-8-13**]

IMPRESSION: Markedly abnormal hepatobiliary scan with no uptake
of DISIDA into the liver during 78 minutes of imaging. This
finding is compatible with severe hepatic dysfunction. Due to
the hepatic dysfunction, the biliary system cannot be evaluated.

Radiology Report CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2113-8-15**]
11:29 AM

CHEST RADIOGRAPH

INDICATION: Hemoptysis, evaluation for changes.

COMPARISON: [**2113-8-14**].

FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, the
pre-existing
right-sided pleural effusion shows a slightly different
distribution but
appears to be overall unchanged. The subtle suprabasal opacity
in the left
lung could have minimally increased in extent. Other opacities
are not
visible. Moderate cardiomegaly with signs of mild to moderate
pulmonary
overhydration. No evidence of left-sided pleural effusion.

Radiology Report CT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST Study Date of [**2113-8-14**]
12:47 AM

CONCLUSION:

The findings of adrenal hyperenhancement and renal
hypoenhancement are
nonspecific but suggest possible infarction or ischemia to these
organs.
As the proximal arteries appear unremarkable and there is no
overt evidence of
significant arteriosclerosis, hypotension must be considered.

Nonspecific dilatation of the small bowel, possibly reflecting
ileus.

No additional findings. Of note, there is joint space narrowing
at L4-L5.
This is felt secondary to degenerative disc disease rather than
discitis.

Radiology Report CT ABD W&W/O C Study Date of [**2113-8-20**] 3:02 PM

IMPRESSION:

1. Homogeneous enhancement of the pancreas.
2. Mild stigmata of cirrhosis.
3. Small fat-containing ventral abdominal hernia.

EGD Report Tuesday, [**2113-8-22**]

Impression: There were no varices seen in the esophagus.
Abnormal mucosa in the stomach (biopsy, biopsy)
Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum

----------

PATHOLOGY EXAMINATION: [**2113-8-22**]

DIAGNOSIS:
Gastric mucosal biopsies, two:
A.  Fundus: Superficial fragment of fundic mucosa with no
diagnostic abnormalities recognized.
B.  Antrum: Antral mucosa with regenerative changes suggestive
of chemical injury.

Pancreatic duct was normal. Bile duct was normal, without
stones.

Brief Hospital Course:
In short, patient is a 55 yo lady with multiple medical problems
including HIV (CD4 257), [**Year (4 digits) **] [**Year (4 digits) 106114**] pneumonitis,
pulmonary HTN, ESRD on HD, cardiomyopathy and emphysema on O2 at
home who presented initially with right shoulder pain and
worsening cough, SOB for 6 months.  She was initially admitted
on [**2113-8-7**] and has had a protracted hospital course.
