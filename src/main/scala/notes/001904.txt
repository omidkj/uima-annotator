HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This patient is a 29-year-old
male who was transferred from an outside hospital for
pneumonia and respiratory failure.  The symptoms began on
[**7-18**] when he had fever, chills, sweats, and a
nonproductive cough.  His fevers ranged around 102 degrees
Fahrenheit but reached 104 degrees Fahrenheit at times.  He
also had a mild headache.  His girlfriend took the patient to
the Emergency Department at [**Location (un) 8641**] on Saturday, [**7-21**].
At that time he was diagnosed with a flu-like viral illness
and given symptomatic treatment as well as amantadine.  He
had no nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, abdominal
pain, dysuria, joint or muscles aches at that time.

His symptoms did not improve, and on [**7-23**] he presented
to his primary care physician, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 24913**], with
central cyanosis and an abnormal chest examination.  He was
admitted to [**Hospital3 26615**] Hospital in [**Location (un) 5028**] where a chest
x-ray showed moderate-sized left lingular infiltrate, and the
patient's oxygen saturation was 90% on 100 nonrebreather
mask.  Sputum culture at that time showed likely oral flora
as well as abundant gram-negative rods.  The patient was
given Levaquin but had phyletic reaction, so his antibiotics
were changed to azithromycin and ceftriaxone.  However, the
patient was still febrile after 48 hours.

He underwent bronchoscopy and bronchoalveolar lavage on
hospital day three at the outside hospital.  Bronchoalveolar
lavage Gram stain showed a nonspecific inflammatory exudate,
and culture showed oral flora with a small number of mucous
gram-negative rods.  Fungal cultures were negative to date.
Silver stain for Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia was negative,
and his urine antigen for Legionella was also negative.  The
patient's respiratory status continued to worsen and he was
intubated.  At that time, azithromycin and ceftriaxone were
discontinued and Zosyn, Bactrim, and gentamicin were started.
The patient was then transferred to the [**Hospital1 190**] Medical Intensive Care Unit on [**7-28**] for
further evaluation.
