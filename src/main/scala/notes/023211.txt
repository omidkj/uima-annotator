Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Lisinopril / Zoloft

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1515**]
Chief Complaint:
Unresponsiveness.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Right lower extremity laser angioplasty on [**9-29**]/9.

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 931**] is a [**Age over 90 **] year old gentleman wiht a PMH significant
for CAD, COPD on 2L nc at night, PE on coumadin, mild AS, and DM
2 transferred to the CCU for unresponsiveness. The patient was
initially admitted to an OSH for unresponsiveness and slurred
speech that spontaneously resolved. At that time, he denied any
chest pain, but does endorse dyspnea with exertion and
occasional exertional chest pain when walking from his bed to
the bathroom.  At the OSH, the patient had a CTH that was
negative and carotid dopplers that demonstrated severe bilateral
carotid stenosis. He was also noted to have a right foot ulcer
for which he received amp/sulbactam and was transfused 1 unit
pRBCs on the morning of [**2174-9-25**] for a hemoglobin of 10.0.  Of
note, the patient was scheduled for an outpatient
revascularization procedure of the RLE on [**2174-9-27**] prior to this
admission.
.
On initial arrival, the patient was noted to be mildly fluid
overloaded and noted that he had increased lower extremity edema
for the past 2 weeks. A CXR demonstrated mild pulmonary edema
and increased pulmonary vascular congestion with a BNP of 2200.
This morning, the patient was found to be unresponsive. On
initial exam, he was noted to have convulsions, which were not
tonic-clonic in nature.  ABG on 2L nc 7.40/62/91 and the patient
received 40 mg IV lasix.  He regained consciousness within
minutes, although remained confused and unable to follow
commands for several minutes without any stool incontinence (FC
in place).
.
Currently, he is resting comfortably without complaints. Denies
CP/SOB, f/c/s, n/v/d, abd pain, HA, palpitations, diaphoresis,
or pain radiating to jaw or arm.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, palpitations, syncope
or presyncope.

Past Medical History:

Physical Exam:
VS: 97 67 [**10/2119**] 89%1L nc
GENERAL: Age appropriate male in NAD
HEENT: Perrl, eomi, sclerae anicteric. MMM, OP clear without
lesions, exudate, or erythema.
CV: Nl S1+S2, II/VI systolic murmur throughout precordium
loudest at the base. Unable to ascertain JVP.
Pulm: Decreased breathsounds at left base. No wheezes.
Abd: S/NT/ND +bs
Ext: 1+ edema bilaterally. Unable to palpate dp/pt pulses
Neuro: Oriented to person and time. CN II-XII intact.
Skin: RLE bandaged. 2x2 cm ulcuer with eschar. No surrounding
erythema.


Pertinent Results:
ECG: Sinus with 1:1 conduction. LBBB. NI. TWI in V1-V3 new
compared to [**2174-7-11**].
.
CXR ([**2174-9-25**]): Mild cardiomegaly is stable. The left
hemidiaphragm is elevated as before, but small bilateral pleural
effusions with adjacent basal atelectasis are new. There is mild
vascular congestion. There is no pneumothorax.
.
CXR ([**2174-9-26**]): New LLL/lingula collapse.
.
Carotid Artery U/S 10/2/9 from OSH:
FINDINGS: On the right, the common carotid artery peak systolic
velocity is 36, diastolic velocity 5, internal carotid artery
peak systolic velocity 143, diastolic velocity 15, external
carotid artery peak systolic velocity 216. The vertebral artery
is visualized with antegrade flow. The peak systolic velocity
ratio is 0, diastolic velocity ratio 3.0. B-mode imaging is
suboptimal, and not adequate to assess plaque morphology or
degree of occlusion; however, based on the velocities obtained,
the occlusion could range anywhere from 60-99%.
.
On the left, the common carotid artery peak systolic velocity is
75, diastolic velocity 12. Internal carotid artery peak systolic
velocity 168, diastolic velocity 61, external carotid artery
peak systolic elocity 220. The vertebral artery is visualized
with antegrade flow. The peak systolic velocity ratio is 2.2,
diastolic velocity ratio 5.1. Again, B- mode imaging is
suboptimal due to patient habitus and cooperation, and is not
adequate to assess the degree of occlusion or morphology of the
plaque. Velocity criteria would suggest occlusion in the range
of 60-99%.

.
CXR [**9-28**]:
CHEST, AP UPRIGHT: There is similar moderate elevation of the
left
hemidiaphragm with confluent opacification of the left lower
chest, likely
reflecting extensive atelectasis of both the left lower lobe and
lingula.
Considerable leftward mediastinal shift is associated with
volume loss,
similar to slightly increased. Given confluent opacification, it
is difficult to exclude an associated pleural effusion. However,
unaffected portions of the lungs are essentially within normal
limits without evidence for pulmonary edema. The right lung
remains clear. There is no evidence of pneumothorax.
IMPRESSION: Persistent collapse of the left lower lobe and
lingula with
volume loss, including elevation of the left hemidiaphragm and
leftward
mediastinal shift, perhaps slightly increased.
.
CTA head/neck:
1. Approximately 80% stenoses of the distal common carotid and
proximal
internal carotid arteries bilaterally.
2. Mild plaque slightly narrowing the right vertebral artery
origin.
3. Mild narrowing of the cavernous and supraclinoid internal
carotid arteries due to atherosclerosis.
4. No evidence of acute intracranial abnormalities. Areas of
supratentorial white matter hypodensity are nonspecific, but
likely represent sequela of chronic microangiopathy, given the
patient's age.
5. Bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right, with
associated
dependent atelectasis. Possible left upper lobe pneumonitis.
These findings are new since [**2174-7-5**].
5. Subluxation of the right temporomandibular joint.

.
EEG results: This is a mildly abnormal routine EEG due to mild
slowing
and disorganization of the background rhythm. These findings
suggest a
mild encephalopathy involving cortical and subcortical
structures.
Medication, toxic/metabolic disturbances, and infection are
among the
most common causes. There were no areas of prominent focal
slowing
although encephalopathies can obscure focal findings. There were
no
epileptiform discharges or electrographic seizures.
.
Cardiac cath [**9-29**]
COMMENTS:
1. Peripheral angiography of the right lower extremity
demonstrated
patent Iliac arteries bilaterally. The right common femoral had
no
hemodynamic angiographically apparent disease. The right SFA had
a
serial calcified 90% stenosis in the mid to distal vessel that
involved
the above knee popliteal. There was single vessel runoff via the
right
AT. The left lower extremity was not injected.
2. Successful PTA and Laser of the right mid to distal SFA and
above
knee popliteal with a 5.0 x 120mm Submarine balloon. Final
angiography
revealed a 20% residual stenosis, no angiographically apparent
dissection or perforation, and excellent flow distally via the
AT. (see
PTA comments for details)
