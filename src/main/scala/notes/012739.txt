Allergies:

Contrast Media

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3021**]
Chief Complaint:
Fever.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
TEE (transesophageal echocardiogram) [**2134-8-6**].
PICC IV line placement [**2134-8-9**].
Port removal [**2134-8-9**].

History of Present Illness:
65F with recurrent breast cancer on chemo with carboplatin,
taxotere, Herceptin (last chemo [**2134-7-19**], Neulasta [**2134-7-20**])
transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] from the radiology suite after a
questionable anaphylactic reaction (dyspnea, hypoxia,
tachycardia, and flushing) to IV contrast for CTA vs worsening
volume overload.

Briefly, she presented to the ED with fever to 104 and rigors at
home, with no obvious source of infection except for HSV-2
vaginal rash and chest rash. She had been seen by dermatology
the day prior who recommended Valtrex 1g po BID x 5 days; it is
unclear whether this had been started. She was also being
evaluated for a rash on her chest thought to be a
hypersensitivity rash related to chemotherapy; she was supposed
to start a course of oral prednisone but had not yet started. Pt
denies dyspnea, cough and chest pain (other than at the skin at
the site of rash). Patient denied any urinary symptoms except
some burning related to vaginal herpes rash; also complained of
abdominal pain and loose stools over the last few days. She did
endorse nausea at the time but denied emesis, and had not had
nausea at home.

In the ED, vital signs were T 100.9 HR 133 BP 89/53 RR 18 O2sat
93% RA. Patient received 2L IVF fluid, blood/urine cultures were
sent and she was given a dose of cefepime and vancomycin. She
was admitted to the [**Location **] service for further
management. On the floor, she was given 20mg IV Lasix for
possible fluid overload (she was recently started on a thiazide
over the last few weeks due to some edema). She was persistently
tachycardic to the low 100s and somewhat short of [**Last Name (LF) 1440**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] was
sent for CTA to rule out PE.  Apparently after receiving IV
contrast, she became dyspneic and tachycardic to the 170s. She
was placed on a non-rebreather and a Code Blue was called for
anaphylaxis. During the code, she got an EpiPen, hydrocortisone
100mg IV, Benadryl 25mg IV x2, and famotidine IV, and was
transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for further management.

On arrival to the MICU, patient's VS were T 102.9, HR 169,
113/75, RR 34, 92% 2L NC. ABG on arrival to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] (on 2L NC)
was 7.39/29/70/18, lactate 4.7 (increased from 2.4 earlier in
the day). Patient appeared less tachypneic and stated that her
dyspnea was improving.In the [**Name (NI) 153**] pt continued broad spectrum
antibiotics which were narrowed to vancomycin after blood
cultures returned back positive for MSSA. She was gently
diuresed. She also developed a.fib adn was started on short
acting diltiazam. She was followed by both dermatology and the
ID service.
On arrival to the floor pt reports that she is feeling better
overall.Breathing has improved significantly as well as the
rash. She has no chest pain or other pain.
