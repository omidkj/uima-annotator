Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 6578**]
Chief Complaint:
shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a [**Age over 90 **]yo woman with h/o CAD s/p NSTEMI in [**12/2128**] that
was medically managed in setting of melenic stools, HTN,
dyslipidemia, COPD on home oxygen, and CRI admitted with c/o
shortness of breath and left-sided chest pain.
Patient was in her usual state of health yesterday, but she
complained of some subjective dyspnea today at her nursing home.
She was noted to be pale and she c/o pain in her left breast.
She was not given NTG given her low BP but did receive 81mg ASA
x 2 en route to the ED.
In the ED, initial VS were 96.0 70 100/70 22 99% 4L. Soon after
triage, she was noted to be hypotensive to 80/40. She was given
an unclear amount of fluid and her pressures improved to
100s/30s. She was noted to be guaiac positive on exam. EKGs were
concerning for STE in V2 and V3 and the cardiology fellow was
contact[**Name (NI) **]. [**Name2 (NI) 6**] Echo done at the bedside showed newly depressed EF
of 50% as compared to 70% in [**1-29**] as well as possible
anteroseptal hypokinesis. After discussing the matter with the
patient and her daughter, it was decided to pursue medical
management, and she was admitted to the CCU. In addition, UA was
positive and there was a concern for infiltrate on CXR. She
received ceftriaxone and azithromycin as well as albuterol and
atrovent nebs. She was also given 1mg ativan IV.

Physical Exam:
VS: T 97.7, BP 101/32->122/67, HR 50->78, RR 17, O2 94-99% on 2L

Gen: Elderly woman in NAD, resp or otherwise. Oriented to
hospital and name, but reports year as [**2052**]. Somewhat nervous.
HEENT: NCAT. Sclera anicteric. PERRL, EOMI. Conjunctiva were
pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.

RR, normal S1, S2. +systolic murmur at base. No S4, no S3.
Chest: s/p mastectomy on the right. Resp were unlabored, no
accessory muscle use. No crackles, wheeze, rhonchi.
Abd: Soft, NTND, No HSM or tenderness. No abdominial bruits.
Ext: Trace LE edema b/l at ankles. No femoral bruits.
Skin: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
Pulses:
Right: Carotid 2+ without bruit; Femoral 2+ without bruit; 2+ DP

Left: Carotid 2+ without bruit; Femoral 2+ without bruit; 2+ DP


Pertinent Results:
EKG demonstrated NSR with normal axis and prolonged QT (480)
with 1-2mm STE in V1-V4 and TWI in I, AVL, and V6; as compared
with prior dated [**2129-2-2**], the QTc has increased from 450 and
the STE in V2 and V3 and no longer upsloping. Of note, EKG done
upon arrival to CCU (at 21:38) demonstrates upsloping ST
elevations in V2 and V3 that are similar in appearance to her
baseline.

2D-ECHOCARDIOGRAM performed on [**2129-5-23**] in ED demonstrated
(PRELIM):
Suboptimal study with focused views. There is symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is low normal (LVEF 50%) with hypokinesis of the basal
anteroseptal and anterior wall. There are three aortic valve
leaflets. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is a
small pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mild hypokinesis of basal anteroseptum and anterior
wall consistent with CAD. Overall EF mildly depressed, 50%. Mild
MR. Compared to prior echo dated [**2129-2-3**], the EF is decreased
and the wall motion is new.

CXR [**2129-5-23**]: RLL pneumonia (prelim)

Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname **] is a [**Age over 90 **] year old female with a PMH significant for
recent NSTEMI admitted after c/o CP and found to have pneumonia.

1. Pneumonia - Found to have a RLL consolidation consistent with
pneumonia.  She was treated for healthcare associated pneumonia
with ceftriaxone, doxycycline, and vancomycin. She was treated
with doxycylcine instead of a azithromycin due to her prolonged
QT on admission. She will need to be treated with her antibiotic
regimen for a total of 10 days (currently day 4), and can stop
her antiobitic therapy on [**2129-6-2**].  For the patient's
vancomycin and ceftriaxone, a PICC line was placed.

2.Acute on chronic renal failure - The patient has a baseline
creatinine of 1.4.  On admission, her creatinine was 1.8, which
trended down to 1.3 on day of discharge.  Likely etiology was
prerenal azotemia with renal function that improved with IV
fluids.  Unlikely to be UTI as urine culture was negative.  The
patient's lasix was held due on admission, but was restarted on
discharge when her renal function returned to baseline.
Vancomycin was renally dosed at 1 gram Q48H with a random
vancomycin level of 15.4.

3.CAD - Recent NSTEMI that was medically managed due to chronic
guiaic positive stool. The patient's presenting symptoms are
unlikely to represent AMI as she has an unchanged ECG with CEx3
negative.  Continue beta blocker, statin, and ASA therapy.

4.COPD - Currently has good O2 sats on 2L nc, which is at her
baseline.  Continue advair, budesonide, and atrovent.

5.Prolonged QTc on admission. She is not taking any QT
prolonging drugs, and QT corrected with repeat ECG.  She will be
treated with doxycycline instead of macrolide.

6. CHF with diastolic dysfunction.  Patient's lasix was held
secondary to acute on chronic renal failure.  She was continued
on her beta blocker, and lasix was restarted on admission after
renal function returned to baseline.

7. Anemia - Baseline HCT of 30, with HCT on admission of 24.4.
She received 2 units of PRBC, and on the day of discharge her
HCT was 36.3.

8. Dementia - Patient was disoriented throughout the course of
her stay.  Per her records, she is at her baseline.

9. Hypothyroid - Continued on home levothyroxine.
