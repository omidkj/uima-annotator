Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4365**]
Chief Complaint:
abdominal pain x 3 days

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
HD

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 22 yo female with a h/o CVID, ESRD on HD who
presents with abdominal pain x 3 days.  She initially presented
to [**Hospital **] Hospital on [**3-21**] with abdominal pain.  She states
pain was so severe at that time that she was unable to walk.
WBC was reported 22,000.  At that time, she reported that she
had not had a bowel movement for four days prior to
presentation.  She received a dose of flagyl and subsequently
signed out AMA because she did not want to drink contrast for a
CT scan.



At the advice of her group home director, she returned to the
[**Location (un) **] ER on [**3-22**].  At that time, she underwent a CT scan with
oral contrast only, as they were unable to obtain IV access.
Blood pressure was documented as 60/p, and a Surgical consult
was obtained for central venous access.  Due to inability to
obtain IV access, she was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] ED.  Patient was
mentating through ED course, and denies any lightheadedness.



On arrival to [**Hospital1 18**] ED, BP 76/42, HR 103, T 98. A 20G PIV was
placed in her R wrist without difficulty.  Radiology reviewed CT
abdomen from OSH, and a Surgical consult was obtained.  BP range
in ED 68-105/30-47, but patient remained asymptomatic.  She was
found to have SpO2 80% on RA and placed on 3L NC.  She received
1L NS, ciprofloxacin 400 mg IV and metronidazole 500 mg IV and
morphine 2 mg IV.



On arrival to MICU, patient complains of persistent abdominal
pain which radiates from her epigastrum to her RLQ.  She
describes it as constant and sharp.  She states that pain
improved with the morphine she received in the ER, but denies
any other relieving factors.  She denies any inciting factors.
She denies any recent nausea, vomiting, fevers, chills, or sick
contacts.  She denies any blood in her stool or tarry stools.
She was constipated prior to original presentation to [**Location (un) **]
ED on [**3-21**], but has subsequently had multiple loose stools since
drinking oral contrast earlier today.  She denies any previous
episodes of abdominal pain.

[**3-22**] CXR:
Vascular cephalization without overt edema.

[**3-23**] CT Abdomen/pelvis:
1. Thickening and inflammatory stranding surrounding the cecum
and proximal
ascending colon is most consistent with an infectious colitis,
especially
given the patient's history of immune deficiency. Typhlitis
should be
considered in the appropriate clinical setting. Inflammatory
bowel disease
would be considered less likely.

2. Multiple venous collaterals in the subcutaneous tissues,
likely related to
central venous stenosis or occlusion, presumably related to the
patient's
reported history of multiple central lines and tunneled venous
catheters.
Upper chest is not imaged on this evaluation, so definitive
characterization
is limited.

3. Non-visualization of the patient's native kidneys, could
relate to marked
atrophy, or possibly surgical resection.

4. Bicornuate uterus.

[**3-26**] CXR:
PA and lateral chest compared to [**3-22**]:

Small region of heterogeneous parenchymal abnormality in the
right lower lobe
medial basal segment looks more like scarring than pneumonia but
could be
pneumonia. Lungs are otherwise clear. There is no pleural
effusion or
evidence of central adenopathy. The massive distention of the
azygous vein as
well as dilatation of the upper mediastinum securing the aortic
knob are both
explained by dilated venous collaterals. No pleural effusion.
Heart size
normal.

[**3-27**] CT chest:
1. Diffuse bilateral parenchymal opacities and centrilobular
nodules with
tree-in-[**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 239**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 81343**] suggest acute infection . Part of the
ground glass
opacities might be explained by expiratory character of the
images. The
findings are atypical for bacterial or fungal infection and
viral or
mycoplasma etiologies are considered more likely.
2. Extensive calcified thrombus within the left brachiocephalic
vein and
superior vena cava presumably from prior indwelling hemodialysis
catheter.
3. Right PICC is deviated by the calcified thrombus to a
termination in the
azygos vein and repositioning suggested.
4. Sclerotic appearance of the skeleton is probably related to
renal disease.
5. Pericardial calcification

[**3-28**] Echo:
The left atrium is normal in size. The right atrial pressure is
indeterminate. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and
global systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%). Due to
suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality
cannot be fully excluded. The aortic valve is not well seen.
There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. No
mitral regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary artery systolic
pressure could not be determined. There is no pericardial
effusion.

IMPRESSION: Suboptimal technical quality. Global left
ventricular function is probably normal, but a focal wall motion
abnormality cannot be fully excluded. The right ventricle is not
well seen. No pathologic valvular abnormality seen. Pulmonary
artery systolic pressure could not be determined.

EEG [**4-7**]
IMPRESSION: This telemetry captured no pushbutton activations.
The
background activity was mostly of high voltage and in the low
theta and
delta frequency ranges, seen either in a generalized
distribution or
more pronounced over the left hemisphere; sometimes similar
lower
voltage activity was seen. These findings are most consistent
with an
encephalopathy.

MR [**Name13 (STitle) 430**] [**4-5**]
SCAN FINDINGS: There are focal areas of FLAIR signal
hyperintensities within
the bilateral frontal subcortical white matter. The lar
