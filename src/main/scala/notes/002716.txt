Service: CARDIOTHORACIC

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 922**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2187-10-9**] - Coronary bypass grafting x2 with left internal mammary
artery to left anterior descending coronary artery, reverse
saphenous vein single graft from the aorta to the first obtuse
marginal coronary artery.
[**2187-10-3**] - Cardiac Catheterization


History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is an 81 year old woman with multiple medical
problems, including DM, chronic renal insufficiency, recent
NSTEMI (3 weeks prior to admission)did not have cardiac
catheterization secondary to poor renal function, diastolic CHF,
requiring lasix gtt on last admission, discharged without lasix,
but recently started on Lasix 20mg po by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on an
outpatient visit, who presents with 3-4 days of progressive
shortness of breath with intermittent substernal chest pressure.
She has had increasing trouble walking around the house and even
completing full sentences. Her visiting nurse visited her
yesterday and instructed her to call her doctor; her doctor
referred her to the ED today. The chest pressure did not radiate
anywhere but was associated with some nausea and diaphoresis.
.
In the ED, EKG showed an old LBBB, and first set of cardiac
enzymes were negative. She was given 40mg IV Lasix. The chest
pressure resolved with the addition of oxygen. Given an elevated
D-dimer, a heparin drip was entertained; however, given the
presence of alternate explanations for shortness of breath in
conjunction with elevated INR (3.8), it was not.
.
Of note, she has had two nosebleeds in the past week which
resolved with pressure and application of ice. She had an
episode of nausea and vomiting last night after dinner, as well
as decrease in appetite. She denies fevers, chills, abdominal
pain, muscle cramps, lower extremity edema, constipation. She
has had looser stools since she was discharged from the hospital
several weeks ago, likely secondary to being discharged on senna
and colace.

[**2187-9-25**]-BILATERAL LOWER EXTREMITY VEIN DOPPLER ULTRASOUND:
Grayscale and Doppler
examination of the bilateral common femoral, superficial femoral
and popliteal
veins were performed.  Normal compressibility, augmentation,
waveforms and
Doppler flow is demonstrated.  There is no evidence of
intraluminal clot.

Renal US [**2187-9-29**]-
1) No hydronephrosis.
2) Hypoechoic nodule in upper pole of left kidney not
definitively
identified on recent priors. In absence of clinical signs to
suggest an acute pathology, recommend follow-up in [**4-17**] months to
reevaluate.

Cardiac Cath 8/22/07-1. Coronary angiography of this right
dominant system revealed a LMCA
with an eccentric 60% lesion extending into the ostial/proximal
portion
of the LCX. The LAD was without significant coronary disease.
The RCA
was without apparent angiographic significant disease.
2. Resting hemodynamics revealed severe systemic hypertension
with an
SBP of 176 mm Hg. Left sided pressures were severely elevated
with an
LVEDP of 32 mm Hg.
3. Left ventriculography was deferred.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Two vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Markedly elevated LVEDP suggestive of severe diastolic
dysfunction.

[**2187-10-5**]- CT-chest w/o contrast-
1. Extensive calcifications of the ascending aorta, normal in
caliber.

2. Mediastinal lymphadenopathy of uncertain significance.

3. Upper normal limit size of pulmonary arteries.  Small left
pleural
effusion.

[**2187-10-5**]-Echo-Symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
preserved global and regional biventricular systolic function.
Diastolic LV dysfunction with
elevated filling pressures. Mild mitral regurgitation.

[**2187-10-6**]-Femoral U/S bilateral-
No pseudoaneurysm or hematoma.

[**2187-10-9**] ECHO
PRE-BYPASS:
1. Mild spontaneous echo contrast is present in the left atrial
appendage. The left atrial appendage emptying velocity is
depressed (<0.2m/s). A left atrial appendage thrombus cannot be
excluded.
2. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
3. Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely
depressed (LVEF= 25%.
4. The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated.
5. There are complex, mobile atheroma in the aortic arch. There
are complex
(>4mm) atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
6. There are three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Trace aortic regurgitation is
seen.
7. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+)
mitral
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened.


Post bypass
1. Initial attempt at coming off CPB was associated with severe
MR and high PA pressures . Back on CPB and started milrinone and
epinephrine.
2. Septal and anteroseptal walls of the LV shows improved
function. RV
function unchanged.
3. Trace mitral regurgitation present.
4. Aorta intact post decannulation.
