Brief Hospital Course:
On [**2106-9-27**] Ms.[**Known lastname **] was taken to the Operating Room and

difficulty. Beta-[**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **], a statin and diuresis were
initiated. Anti-inflammatory medications were started per
protocol. All lines and drains were discontinued in a timely
fashion. On POD# 1 she was transferred to the step down unit for
further monitoring. Physical Therapy was consulted for
evaluation of strength and mobility. She continued to make
steady progress and was discharged home on postoperative day
three. She will follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 914**], her cardiologist and
her primary care physician as an outpatient. As per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 914**],
