Brief Hospital Course:
45 y/o female who received pancreas after kidney  on [**2115-5-14**].
She was discharged to home on POD 6 and returns on POD 8 feeling
very weak, had hypotension and after evaluation in the ED was
admitted to the SICU and was immediately intubated.
Her immediate chest xray showed new moderate pulmonary edema and
new small to moderate right pleural effusion with atelectasis.
A head CT was performed due to altered mental status showing no
hemorrhage, edema, or evidence of other acute intracranial
process.
A full torso CT was also performed showing:
-Bilateral small-to-moderate pleural effusions, right greater
than left,
are new since the prior study.
- Multifocal airspace consolidations and peribronchovascular
opacities,
likely represent multifocal pneumonia.
- The patient is status post recent pancreatic transplant, there
is minimal
simple fluid and a single locule of air in the region. This is
unchanged
since the prior study and likely secondary to the recent
surgery. No definite
evidence of an anastomotic leak is detected.
.
She underwent a bronchoscopy with BAL, initial culture was
negative for organisms, and viral, fungal and cmv cultures are
negative to date. Blood CMV viral load is negative.
ID was consulted, she was immediately started on Vanco and
zosyn. On HD 2 she was extubated and on HD 4 she was transferred
out of the SICU.
Her O2 sats were stable on room air, but in the low 90's with
ambulation.
She had some loose stools, c diffs were negative. She received 3
days of flagyl and the cellcept was changed to 500 mg QID, the
stool issue was resolved by day of discharge.
The patient was noted to have a slowly drifting Hct, and
received one unit of blood prior to her discharge. Iron studies
were also sent, but these may be difficult to interpret as she
received blood after the pancreas transplant about 10 days prior
to the testing.
Immunosuppression was monitored daily with prograf levels, and
after her ICU stay she was eventually back to 3 mg [**Hospital1 **]. As
mentioned, the cellcept was changed to QID, she is off steroids.
Her blood sugars were very stable in the low 100's, amylase and
lipase were wnl.
A PICC line was placed and IV Zosyn will be continued through
[**6-4**] at home. Although no cultures ever became positive, the
patient improved dramatically on the Zosyn and ID wanted a full
2 week course. Home teaching for infusion was provided to the
patient.
