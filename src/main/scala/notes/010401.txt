Dyspnea on exertion

History of Present Illness:
Pt is a 69 year-old male with dCHF (EF>60% [**2-/2198**]), IDDM2, HTN,
and CAD s/p muliple stents with multiple ISRS, and recent PE
([**1-/2198**]) recently admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] from [**Date range (1) 13375**] for CP and
dyspnea at rest who underwent C. cath which showed 3VD, diffuse
LAD disease, and severe ISRS of RCA without intervention. He has
had intermittent CP and DOE 1-2 times per week since discharge
with improvement from SL nitro. The last 2-3 days he has had
increasing epigastric/CP and DOE with decreased response to sl
ntg. He saw his PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 3011**] ([**10-16**]) who sent him to the ED.
.
ED Course: Initial vitals: Pain 7, T: 97.1, HR: 81, BP: 117/63,
RR: 16, pO2: 99% 2LNC. EKG per report with ST elevations in
II/III/AVF whic were present on previous EKGs but may have been
minimally increased and new TWI in V2, I, AVL. Stools heme
negative, given 325mg ASA, plavix 600mg, started on heparin drip
with bolus of 4,000 @ 900u/hr, started on NTG drip at 0.14
mcg/kg/min.
18G X2 PIV in place.
Vitals on transfer: 73, 149/68, 15, 100%/1L. CP free in the [**Name (NI) **],
unclear what resolved it. On transfer noted that he has a HA and
wants to eat and go home.
.
On review of systems, he does report prior PE which he was
treated with coumadin for 6 months. He denies any prior history
of stroke, TIA, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint
pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools. He denies
recent fevers, chills or rigors. All of the other review of
systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of paroxysmal
nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope
or presyncope.

STRESS [**2198-10-18**]
IMPRESSION: Anginal type symptoms in the presence of
non-specific EKG
changes during recovery at a low cardiac demand and fair
functional
capacity. Blunted hemodynamic response. Echo report sent
separately.
.
ECHO: [**2198-10-18**]
The patient exercised for 10 minutes and 30 seconds according to
[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 4001**] treadmill protocol (5.5 METS) reaching a peak heart
rate of 105 bpm and a peak blood pressure of 118/48 mmHg. The
test was stopped because of fatigue. The test was stopped
because of shortness of breath. This level of exercise
represents a fair exercise tolerance for age. In response to
stress, the ECG showed equivocal/borderline ischemic ST wave
changes (see exercise report for details). The blood pressure
response to stress was blunted. There was a normal heart rate
response to exercise.
.
Resting images were acquired at a heart rate of 72 bpm and a
blood pressure of 108/54 mmHg. These demonstrated normal
regional and global left ventricular systolic function. Right
ventricular free wall motion is normal. There is no pericardial
effusion. Doppler demonstrated no aortic stenosis, aortic
regurgitation or significant mitral regurgitation or resting
LVOT gradient.
Echo images were acquired within 86 seconds after peak stress at
heart rates of 98 - 90 bpm. These demonstrated appropriate
augmentation of all left ventricular segments with slight
decrease in cavity size. There was augmentation of right
ventricular free wall motion.
.
IMPRESSION: fair functional exercise capacity. borderline ECG
changes in the absence of 2D echocardiographic evidence of
inducible ischemia to achieved workload.
.
Cardiac Cath [**2198-10-19**]
1. Selective coronary angiography in this right dominant system
demonstrated three vessel disease. The LMCA had no
angiographically
apparent disease. The LAD had a 50% mid vessel stenosis aswell
as a 60%
distal stenosis. The Cx had a 40-50% proximal steno
