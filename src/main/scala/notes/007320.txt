Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 148**]
Chief Complaint:
Vomiting/?Hematemesis

Repair of biliary ductal leak from liver laceration.
Exploratory laparotomy.
Extended adhesiolysis.
Small bowel resection in ileum.
Enterotomy for decompression of small bowel.


History of Present Illness:
71 year old man with known unresectable pancreatic
anedocarcinoma s/p palliative duodenal stenting in [**12/2140**] who
presents with two episodes of hematemesis this morning. He
reports waking up early this morning and having one episode of
emesis (without nausea) that was [**Location (un) 2452**]-colored; this was
followed shortly by an episode of dark red emesis which the
patient thought was blood (more than a cupfull) and so he called
EMS. In the ambulance, he reports an additional episode of dark
red emesis. He denies any fevers, chills, abdominal pain, change
in PO intake, chest pain, lightheadedness, dizziness,
palpitations, melena, or BRBPR.
.
In the ED, his initial vitals were T 98.4, BP 115/56, HR 118,
Sat 96% on room air. NG lavage revealed approx 800cc of dark
brown material, guiac +. A hematocrit was 29 (baseline 31 last
week). He received a 250cc NS bolus and pantoprazole 40mg IV x1.

.
Pt was transferred to [**Hospital Ward Name 332**] ICU, where he was placed on IV BID
PPI, had Hct monitered, kept NPO, and had NG tube to suction
with some dark material noted. Pt's Hct went from 29.4 -> 25.7,
and was therefore transfused 1 unit of pRBC, which bumped Hct
appropriately to 28.3. KUB demonstrated evidence of ileus versus
early SBO. Pt otherwise remained hemodynamically and
symptomatically stable. He was brought for ERCP on day after
admission to evaluate his duodenal stent (?blockage versus
eroding into duodenal mucosa as etiology of pt's symptoms),
which demonstrated food impaction at the level of the stent,
with no evidence of new or old bleeding.
.
Currently, the patient is afebrile with stable vital signs, and
c/o slight nausea and some lower abdominal pain. Otherwise, ROS
is negative.
.

KUB ([**2141-3-11**]):
Moderately dilated loops of small bowel, with presence of air
and stool in the colon, gas pattern worrisome for ileus. Early
small bowel obstruction cannot be ruled out. Osseous findings
suggestive of ankylosing spondylitis.
.
CXR ([**2141-3-11**]):
No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process.
.
ECG ([**2141-3-11**]):
sinus tachycardia at 118 bpm; normal axis, normal intervals;
LVH; ST-T wave depression in I, aVL, V3-V6 (old)
.
[**3-13**] CT Abd/Pelvis:
IMPRESSION:
1. Small bowel obstruction with focal transition point noted
within the right lower quadrant. This is likely related to
adhesions; while the appearance has one that could be seen in
internal hernias, this is felt less likely because of the
location. 2. Stable appearance to known pancreatic head mass
without change in pancreatic duct dilation. 3. Interval
appearance of pneumobilia, likely related to recent ERCP with
stable appearance to intrahepatic biliary dilatation. 4.
Interval appearance of new small bilateral pleural effusions
(left greater than right). 5. Stable appearance to ankylosing
spondylitis.
.
[**3-27**] CT abd pelvis: Extensive small bowel obstruction with
extensive pneumatosis and air within the mesenteric vein. Stable
appearance to known pancreatic head mass. Unchanged pneumobilia
and intrahepatic biliary duct dilatation. Interval resolution of
right pleural effusion, stable small left pleural effusion.
.


Brief Hospital Course:
On admission to the hospital, the following issues regarding Mr
[**Known lastname 16268**] were present:
.
## Acute blood loss anemia: likely due to malfunction of
duodenal stent
- q6h Hcts; transfuse for evidence of active bleeding
- GI input appreciated; may require stent re-placement
- active T&S; 2 large-bore PIVs
- [**Hospital1 **] IV ppi
- consent for blood transfusion
- prn ondansetron for nausea
- hold Lasix, spironolactone for now; give short-acting,
reduced-dose beta-bloc
