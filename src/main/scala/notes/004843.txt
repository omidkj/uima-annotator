Service:  CSU


HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 35 year old
male with a history of tetralogy of Fallot, pulmonary
atresia, who presented to the cardiac surgery service for
redo heart surgery to repair his aortic valve as well as
repair his aortic root. The patient is status post right  BT
shunt in [**2133-3-25**], status post VSD closure and RV to PA
conduit in [**2137-4-24**], status post replacement of said conduit
in [**2145-1-25**], and a repeat repair of this conduit again
in [**2153-2-22**]. The patient is normally seen at [**Hospital3 18242**] as part of the [**Location (un) 86**] Adult Congenital Heart Disease
Program. He presented to the [**Hospital1 188**] for AVR and aortic root replacement.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Tetralogy of Fallot.

Pulmonary atresia.

Atrial flutter.

History of endocarditis.

Hepatitis C.

History of alcohol abuse.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  As stated above, however, briefly:
Right BT shunt in [**2132**].

RV to PA conduit and VSD closure in [**2135**].

Homograft RV to PA conduit with reoperation for bleeding
[**2136**].

Pacemaker insertion.

Excision of RV to PA homograft conduit in [**2152**].


MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1. Digoxin 0.25 mg p.o. daily.
2. Lisinopril 5 mg p.o. daily.
3. Coumadin 5 mg p.o. daily.
4. Amiodarone 400 mg p.o. daily.
5. Colace 40 mg p.o. daily.
6. BuSpar 15 mg p.o. b.i.d.


ALLERGIES:  Codeine which causes hives.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Unremarkable.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Significant for alcohol abuse in the past
unspecified.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On physical examination, the patient
is afebrile, vital signs were stable. No apparent distress
and alert. Neck showed 2+ carotid bruits, but no JVD. The
heart was regular rate and rhythm with a IV/VI systolic
ejection murmur. Chest was clear to auscultation bilaterally.
The belly was soft, nontender. Extremities with no edema.
Pulse examination was 2+ palpable bilaterally throughout.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted on [**2157-4-27**],
for preoperative heparinization prior to going to the
operating room. On [**2157-5-1**], the patient went to the
operating room for Ventol procedure, right ventricular
outflow tract reconstruction, pulmonic valve replacement,
right pulmonary artery angioplasty. Postoperatively, the
patient came to the CSRU where the patient was critically ill
after a long bypass run. The patient had postoperative
bleeding and coagulopathy which was corrected with massive
blood product transfusion. The patient was bronchoscoped on a
number of occasions, also placed on CAVHD per the renal
recommendations. On postoperative day #1, general surgery was
consulted for metabolic acidosis and extreme abdominal
distention, question abdominal compartment syndrome. On
postoperative day #1, the patient was subjected to laparotomy
at the bedside. In addition, the patient had an open chest.
This was from postoperative course. On postoperative day
#1, vascular consultation was obtained as well for cold and
mottled extremities. A four quarter fasciotomy was performed
via vascular surgery as well as plastic surgery. Throughout
this time, the patient continued to be extremely
coagulopathic, bleeding from all cut and raw edges.
Postoperative day #1, and into #2, the patient had [**Last Name (un) 4161**]
electrocautery at the bedside to try to stem the bleeding
with minimal results. On the morning of postoperative day #2,
the patient was increasingly hypotensive after fasciotomy
secondary to bleeding from all open wounds, acidosis and
hypoxemia. Chest was reopened and cleared out of collections
and there was no evidence of tamponade. Second left chest
tube was placed more anteriorly and drained approximately 450
cc of old blood. Chest x-ray showed some improvement in the
left lung expansion. The patient continued to have a constant
need for transfusion to maintain a blood pressure greater
than 80 and mixed venous gas of oxygen saturation of greater
than 50, massive correction of coagulopathy with fresh frozen
plasma, cryoprecipitate and platelets. All wounds were
reopened and bleeding points were cauterized with minimal
results. It was noted at this time that the right leg and arm
were probably not viable and unsalvageable. The patient
progressively had a decrease in blood pressure to
approximately 70 systolic with a mixed venous oxygen
saturation of 40% and a CVP of greater than 23. Lactate also
was at greater than 27 with a base excess of negative 7,
cardiac index of less than 2 and increasing inotropic
support. The patient proceeded not to respond to volume
resuscitation. EKG showed increasing widening of the QRS
complex. CKs at this time were greater than 10,000 indicative
of severe rhabdomyolysis. Lactate continued to increase
despite bicarbonate infusion with CAVHD. It was determined at
this time that the patient would not survive over the next
couple of hours. The patient did indeed expire at 9:14 a.m.
[**2157-5-1**], from cardiopulmonary arrest. The family was at
the bedside and postmortem was granted by the mother.
