UNILAT UP EXT VEINS US RIGHT

Reason: R/O DVT PT HAS LINE IN AND RT ARM SWELLING

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
71 year old man with PICC in R and increased swelling.
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
r/o DVT
INDICATION: PICC in right arm. Increased swelling. Rule out DVT.

RIGHT UPPER EXTREMITY ULTRASOUND: Grayscale, spectral, and color
Doppler analysis of the right internal jugular vein, subclavian
vein, axillary vein, brachial veins, cephalic vein, and basilic
vein was performed. PICC catheter is seen in one of the brachial
veins. There is normal flow, compressibility, augmentation, and
waveforms in the right jugular vein, axillary vein, and brachial
veins. No evidence of thrombus in the basilic or cephalic veins.

IMPRESSION: No evidence of right upper extremity DVT.

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
71 year old man s/p MVR
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
please place PICC
INDICATION FOR EXAM: This is a 71-year-old man status post MVR,
needs IV access.

RADIOLOGISTS: The procedure was performed by Drs. [**Last Name (STitle) 15785**] and
[**Name5 (PTitle) 380**], the attending radiologist who was present and
supervising throughout the procedure.

PROCEDURE AND FINDINGS: Since no suitable veins were visible,
ultrasound was used to identify the right basilic vein, which
was patent and compressible. The right arm of the patient was
then prepped and draped in standard sterile fashion. After
injection of 5 cc of 1% lidocaine, 21-gauge needle was advanced
into the right basilic vein under ultrasonographic guidance.
Hard copies of the images before and after the venipuncture were
obtained. A 0.018 guidewire was then advanced through the needle
into the distal part of the SVC under fluoroscopic guidance. The
needle was then exchanged for a 5 French micropuncture sheath.
Based on the markers in the guidewire, it was decided that a
length of 43 cm would be suitable. The line was then trimmed to
this length and advanced over the wire into the distal part of
th
