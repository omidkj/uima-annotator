Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 290**]
Chief Complaint:
nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Central line placement
Hemodialysis
Tunnelled HD line [**2120-6-18**]
PICC line placement [**2120-6-10**] on Right side

History of Present Illness:
63 year old woman with HTN, Asthma, fibromyalgia/chronic pain,
h/o breast cancer in remission ([**2102**]), lung SCC (resected in
[**2116**]), tracheal cancer ([**4-/2119**] s/p chemoXRT and
radiation induced esophagitis), who presents with bilateral
upper abdominal pain with nausea and vomitting.  Her g-tube
removed last week, she says she has been gaining weight.  Denies
fever/chills.

In the ED, initial vitals were: 98F 92 162/98 16 100% RA.
Oxygen saturations dropped and she required 8L via venti-mask.
Combivent was given.  She received 500cc IVF.  Labs were notable
for newly elevated AST/ALT (2-3K), [**Last Name (un) **] (Cr 1.4 from baseline
0.9), metabolic acidosis (AG 24 with lactate 4.8), trop 0.03.
CT torso showed multifocal opacities suggestive of pneumonia
(possible aspiration) without acute intra-abdominal process.
She was given vancomycin and zosyn.  She was found to be in new
afib with RVR with rates 150 and LBBB.  Subsequently she
received 20mg IV diltiazem with rates dropping to 90s.  RVR
recurred prompting another 10mg IV dilitiazem.  Blood pressure
was stable with SBP 130-140s throughout ED stay.  She also
received 10mg morphine for pain, reglan 5mg and zofran 8mg for
nausea.  Peripheral IV access could not be obtained, therefore
R. femoral CVL was placed.

On arrival to the MICU, Pt is in NAD, she has some difficulty
answering questions and ignore certain questions. She has a
non-labored breathing pattern while lying flat.

Discharge exam:

Pertinent Results:
IMAGING:

PORTABLE ABDOMEN [**2120-6-22**]
Reason: evaluate for bowel obstruction, large amount of stool.
No air-filled dilated loops of small or large bowel are
identified.  However, there is a relative paucity of gas
throughout the abdomen and the possibility of some fluid-filled
loops, including dilated fluid-filled loops, cannot be entirely
excluded.  There is a large amount of stool in the rectal vault.
 Multiple calcifications overlie the lower pelvis.   On the
left, some of these lie above the iliac spine. IMPRESSION:
1) Relative paucity of gas within most of the bowel, of
uncertain clinical
significance. If there is high clinical suspicion for
obstruction, then
further assessment with CT would be recommended.
2) Large amount of stool in the rectal vault.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP) [**2120-6-22**]
A right-sided PICC line is present, tip overlying mid/distal
SVC.  A
left-sided dual-lumen catheter is present, tips overlying SVC/RA
junction and RA.  No pneumothorax is identified. There are low
inspiratory volumes.  There is cardiomegaly with vascular
plethora and vascular blurring, though these findings are likely
accentuated by low inspiratory volumes.  There is increased
opacity at the right base, which could represent a combination
of pleural fluid, elevated hemidiaphragm,
and underlying collapse and/or consolidation.   There is also
pleural
thickening and/or fluid at the right lung apex. Sutures noted
about the right hilum.  The left costophrenic sulcus is clear.
Compared with [**2120-6-15**], findings at the right base are
similar. There is slightly less opacity at the right apex.  The
CHF findings may be slightly
worse.

TUNNELED DIALYSIS LINE PLACEMENT [**2120-6-18**]
Successful placement of tunneled hemodialysis line through the
left
external jugular vein.  The left internal jugular vein was found
to be
occluded. Withdrawal of right-sided temporary hemodialysis line.


LOWER EXTREMITY ARTERIAL NONIVASIVES AT REST [**2120-6-17**]
REASON:  Ischemic toes.
FINDINGS:  Doppler waveform analysis reveals triphasic waveforms
at the right common femoral, popliteal, and DP.  There are
mono/biphasic waveforms at the PT.  The right ABI is 1.2.  On
the left, there are triphasic waveforms at the common femoral,
popliteal, and mono/biphasic waveforms at the DP and PT. The
left ABI is 1.2. Pulse volume recordings demonstrate
preservation of the dicrotic notch down through the metatarsal
level bilaterally. IMPRESSION:  Mild bilateral tibial arterial
disease.

MR HEAD W/O CONTRAST; MR INCOMPLETE STUDY [**2120-6-11**]
Limited examination, the patient became unstable and the study
was discontinued, only diffusion-weighted images and sagittal
images were
obtained. There is no evidence of diffusion abnormalities to
indicate restricted diffusion or acute/subacute ischemic
changes. Prominent ventricles and sulci remain unchanged since
the prior MRI of the
brain dated [**2119-12-27**]. There is no evidence of acute
intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST [**2120-6-9**]:
There is no hemorrhage, edema, mass effect, or territorial
infarction.  The ventricles and sulci are normal in size and
co
