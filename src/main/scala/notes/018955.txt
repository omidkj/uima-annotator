Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 9554**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac catheterization [**2125-5-4**] with no intervention

History of Present Illness:
The patient is an 82 y.o F with a past medical history
significant for CAD s/p CABG (LIMA->LAD, SVG->OM, PDA with
anastomoses to D1, PDA), COPD, and PAF who was transferred from
LRGH in [**Location (un) 3844**] in the setting of NSTEMI with cardiogenic
shock.

The patient was originally admitted in [**2125-2-10**] w/pna+CHF,
treated w/Abx, ruled in w/NSSTW changes, TTE at that time: EF
60%, mod MR, pt offered cath-refused.
Soon after, readmitted w/ recurrent pneumonia, treated
w/Abx/steroids/for 7 days. Her stay was complicated by C.
difficile with WBC of 80,000 as well as hypotension. She was
treated with flagyl PO which she failed. Vanco was added,
abdominal CT did not show surgical abdomen with bowel wall edema
c/w C. difficile enterocolitis. She ruled out for an MI. She was
treated with vanco for 2 weeks. At that time, C. difficile was
negative x 2 and antibiotics were discontinued. She then
developed paroxysmal atrial fibrillation with NSVT and started
on coumadin. At the same time, she developed acute renal failure
with a creatinine peak of 3.8 with a negative renal ultrasound.
Her urine cultures grew pseudomonas x 2 as well as klebsiella.
She was given tobramycin for a total of 4 doses. After the last
dose, she developed diarrhea once again as well as wheezing and
hypoxia with O2 sats of 88% with a CXR suspicious for LLL PMA.
Her antibiotics were changed to Zosyn IV Flagyl in addition to
PO vanco.

24 hours prior to transfer, the patient developed afib with RVR
to 130 and given beta-blockers and placed on a cardizem drip.
Her troponin was 9 and peaked at 11 with EKG with afib and
lateral ST depressions. TTE on [**2-26**] showed:

Focal posterior and basal inferior HK, EF 55-60%, moderate mr,
mild tr

However, repeat TTE on day of transfer showed EF 30% with severe
TR. She developed hypotension and transferred to the ICU. DCCV
was attempted and failed. A swan was placed with CO of 2.5, CI
1.8, SVR [**2120**] on neo with a wedge of 40. She then developed
progressive dyspnea and was intubated prior to transfer. During
intubation, she vomited rusty-colored sputum concerning for
coffee-grounds. Post-intubation CXR showed LLL infiltrate with
pleural effusion and CHF. During her stay, she was also followed
by vascular for severe peripheral edema.

The patient is on high-dose steroids for ?adrenal insufficiency.
The patient has not tolerated an ACE or [**Last Name (un) **] in the past
secondary to ARF.

She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for cath in the setting of
cardiogenic shock and NSTEMI.

Cath [**2119-12-27**]:
lmca distal 60%
LAD small, 90% prox, occluded mid
Lima patent
lcx 60-70% prox, before om 50%
Om graft patent w/ 50% at anastomosis
RCA dominant, occluded mid
RCA graft patent, pda 90%
LV normal function with mild anterolateral HK, no MR

Ext - +2 p. edema to knees bilaterally


Pertinent Results:
[**2125-5-4**] Cardiac CATH
1. Selective coronary angiography revealed 30% disease in the
LMCA. The
LAD was 100% occluded in the mid vessel. There was a 80%
diagonal
lesion. The LCX was totally occluded. The RCA was known
occluded.
2. Graft angiography revealed a patent SVG to OM graft and a
patient
LIMA to LAD graft. The SVG to RCA was ectatic with multiple
aneurysm and
seial 50 and 70% stensoses in the RCA and PDA distal to the
touchdown.
3. Limited hemodynamics showed normal central pressure while the
patient
was on milrinone, levofed, and vasopressin.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Patent SVG to OM, SVG to RCA, and LIMA to LAD.

Echo: The left atrium is elongated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated. The left ventricular cavity size is normal.
There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed.
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function may be more
depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.] Resting
regional wall motion abnormalities include basal to mid
inferolateral/inferior akinesis/hypokinesis. The basal to mid
inferior/inferolateral region is aneurysmal. Right ventricular
systolic function is normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are
mildly thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis. Trace
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened.
Severe (4+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The mitral
regurgitation jet is
eccentric. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There
is mild
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
effusion.

CXR: Endotracheal tube and nasogastric tube are in satisfactory
position. Enteric tube remains in stable, satisfactory position.
As before, the Swan-Ganz catheter terminates within the right
interlobar pulmonary artery. There is a persistent congestive
heart failure pattern, unchanged. A small-to-moderate left
pleural effusion is noted with collapse/consolidation of the
left lower lobe.
IMPRESSION:
1) Persistent congestive heart failure pattern.
2) Small-to-moderate left pleural effusion with associated left
lower lobe atelectasis or consolidation.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient is an 82 year old female with a history of CAD s/p
CABG, CRI, CHF EF 20%, COPD now with cardiogenic shock s/p
NSTEMI with c. difficile colitis on vancomycin and ?LLL
pneumonia on Zosyn/Flagyl who was transferred from LRGH for cath

1. CHF, EF 20%
- Normal LV function per cath in 11-99, echo on [**2-26**] with EF 55%
now with EF 20% in setting of rising troponins, shortness of
breath, and hypotension likely secondary to cardiogenic shock
and NSTEMI
- The patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] on neo with an index of
1.8 and SVR of [**2120**]. We decided to wean the neo to off and start
milrinone for ionotropic support as well as vasopressin.
- Her swan was misplaced on admission with likely position in
the RV which was refloated to wedge position with the following
pressure readings:

CVP 14
RV 32/12
PAP 35/23 (28)
Wedge 17

- The patient's goal wedge is 16-17. On [**2125-5-5**], the patient's
sodium dropped and she appeared to have anasarca. Our goal for
diuresis was 1.5 liters out and we gave 80 mg IV lasix.

Our CO on admission was 3.1, CI 1.67 and SVR of 1265 on 0.7 on
neo.
- Her final CO was 5 with an index of 3 and SVR 980 on milrinone
and vasopressin.

2. CAD
- The patient is on heparin gtt, ASA, no beta-blocker at present
given her cardiogenic shock and a statin was held due to her
elevated LFTs.
- The patient's family was insis
