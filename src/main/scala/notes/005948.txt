CT ABDOMEN W/O CONTRAST; CT PELVIS W/O CONTRAST

CT OF THE ABDOMEN: There are emphysematous changes of the lung
bases with superimposed atelectasis and scarring. The visualized
pericardium appears unremarkable. Extensive coronary artery
calcifications are identified. Non- contrast examination limits
assessment of the abdominal organs. The liver, adrenal glands,
spleen, and pancreas appear unremarkable. Gallstones are seen
within the gallbladder lumen without evidence of gallbladder
wall edema or pericholecystic fluid. The kidneys appear
symmetric without hydronephrosis. Contrast is seen within the
collecting systems bilaterally, consistent with recent
angiography. A 1.3-cm hypodensity in the left kidney is
incompletely characterized. The loops of small and large bowel
appear normal in caliber. There is extensive atherosclerosis of
the abdominal aorta and its major branches. No free air or free
fluid is seen within the abdomen. There is some nonspecific
perinephric stranding. No obvious mesenteric or retroperitoneal
lymphadenopathy is identified.

CT OF THE PELVIS: There is a large right-sided retroperitoneal
hematoma measuring at least 9.2 x 6.4 cm, causing mass effect on
the bladder. A Foley catheter is seen within the bladder lumen.
The uterus and rectum appear unremarkable. Bilateral common
iliac stents are identified. The lack of intravenous contrast
prevents the assessment of possible active extravasation into
the hematoma.

The osseous structures demonstrate healed fractures of the
inferior pubic rami bilaterally. Degenerative change of the
spine is identified.

IMPRESSION:
1. Large right-sided retroperitoneal hematoma.
2. Cholelithiasis.
3. Emphysematous change of the lung bases.
