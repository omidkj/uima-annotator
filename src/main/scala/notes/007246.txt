Chief Complaint:
anaphylaxis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
intubation, chest tube placement

History of Present Illness:
29 year old female with prior medical history of asthma (without
prior intubations) and ?IV drug abuse initially presented to the
[**Hospital3 **] ED with difficulty breathing.  Her and her boyfriend
were at a house with a lots of dogs when she noticed hives on
her body.  Soon after, she started having trouble breathing and
was brought to the ED.  The triage RN asked if she had asthma
and she nodded yes.  She then became unresponsive and cyanotic
en route to the trauma room with telemetry showing sinus
bradycardia.  She was noted to have an urticarial rash. She then
required intubation for hypercarbic respiratory failure (initial
ABG at OSH was 7.09/84/478).  Labs showed a leukocytosis to 14.8
with 23.9% eosinophils (16.9% manual diff) and a tox screen was
positive for opiates and benzos (?taken after lorazepam was
given for intubation).  She had high peak pressures, was
extremely difficult to bag mask ventilate, and was paralyzed
with vecuronium with resulting improved oxygenation and
ventilation.  At [**Hospital3 **], she was given methylprednisolone,
famotidine, magnesium (2g), combivent nebs x3, terbutaline SC,
and epinephrine IM to treat both an asthma exacerbation and an
allergic reaction.  She was given a ketamine bolus + gtt for
bronchodilation and sedation (used for rapid sequence intubation
in asthmatics due to theoretical bronchodilatory effects in
animal studies).  They also tried Narcan.  Prior to transport,
she was bolused once again with vecuronium for paralysis due to
difficulty with ventilation.

On arrival to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, she was continued on ketamine and a
repeat CXR showed pneumomediastinum with pressures dropping to
the  70s/50s.  Needle decompression was performed and chest tube
inserted, with improvement of blood pressures to 110s/60s.
Vanc/Zosyn was given for broad coverage due to unclear
presentation.  She received epi IM + gtt for the hives/allergic
reaction and another 50mg IV diphenhydramine.  Thoracics was
consulted due to chest tube insertion and will follow along.  2L
NS were given.  She was transported to the floor on fentanyl +
midazolam for sedation.

On arrival to the MICU, she intubated, sedated, and blood
pressures were high enough that epinephrine drip was stopped.
She is somewhat resistant to nursing care and needed bolus
sedation to calm down.  She is covered in hives.

ECG  [**2109-8-6**]  12:55:22 AM

Sinus tachycardia. There is 60 cycle baseline artifact. Except
for the rate,tracing is normal. No previous tracing available
for comparison.

Imaging:

[**8-6**] CXR
There is pneumopericardium and pneumomediastinum.  The latter
could obscure
medial pneumothorax, or mimic it.  An upright radiograph is
recommended if
feasible to see if there is actually air in the pleural space.
A wedge of
radiopacity in the right lower lung is probably atelectasis, but
I am not sure whether it is middle or lower lobe.  There is no
pneumothorax on the right.  ET tube tip at the thoracic inlet is
no less than 5.5 cm from the carina, with the chin elevated,
acceptable position.  Nasogastric tube ends in the mid stomach.
Heart size is exaggerated by low lung volumes.  There is mild
pulmonary vascular congestion but no edema or appreciable
pleural effusion.

CT Chest IMPRESSION:
1.  Extensive pneumomediastinum and subcutaneous emphysema.  No
evidence of
esophageal rupture or tracheal laceration.  Pneumomediastinum
and
pneumopericardium could have been due to bronchospasm
exacerbated by forceful positive pressure ventilation.
2.  Small left pneumothorax; chest tube terminates low and
anterior.
3.  Bibasilar atelectasis, less likely mixed with pneumonia.

[**8-7**] CXR FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of earlier in this
date, the left chest tube has been removed and there is no
evidence of pneumothorax.  Persistent subcutaneous gas along the
left lateral chest wall. The atelectatic changes at the right
base have decreased.  No evidence of vascular congestion.

Brief Hospital Course:
29 year old female with history of asthma and ?IV drug abuse who
presented with respiratory failure secondary to anaphylaxis.

# Anaphylaxis with hypercarbic respiratory failure: Although she
has a hx of asthma/allergies, this was her first anaphylactic
reaction. She was intubated upon arrival to the OSH ED with
hypercarbia to the 80s and hypotension (secondary to
vasod
