Pertinent Results:
[**2-4**]
Echo: Prebypass: A left-to-right shunt across the interatrial
septum is seen at rest. A small secundum atrial septal defect is
present. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve is bicuspid. The aortic valve leaflets are severely
thickened/deformed. There is critical aortic valve stenosis
(valve area <0.8cm2). Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate to
severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Moderate [2+]
tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial
effusion. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in person of the
results on [**2144-2-4**] at 900am.
Post bypass: Patient is AV paced and receiving an infusion of
phenylephrine. Biventricular systolic function is unchanged.
Mechanical valve seen in the aortic position. The leaflets move
well and the valve appears well seated. The paeak gradient
across the aortic valve is 20 mm Hg. The mitral regurgitation
varies between 2 to 3 +. Dr [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 3318**] present to confirm the
findings. Surgeon made aware of findings. Decided to go back on
CPB to fix the mitral regurgitation. Post second bypass there is
a jet seen extending from the aortic root to the left atrium. Dr
[**Last Name (STitle) 3318**] present to confirm findings. Surgeon made aware. On CPB
to fix it. Despite third bypass run the jet extending from the
aortic root to the left atrium persists. Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **] made
aware. Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **] consulted. To be left alone for now.
Annuloplasty ring seen in the mitral position. It appears well
seated. Trivial mitral regurgitation persists. Aorta is intact
post decannulation.

Brief Hospital Course:
This 57-year-old patient with recent syncopal attacks was
investigated and was found to have a critical aortic stenosis,
moderate mitral regurgitation with preserved
left ventricular function. The patient was brought to the
operating room on [**2144-2-4**] where the patient underwent an aortic
valve replacement with size 23 St. [**Male First Name (un) 923**] Regent mechanical valve
and mitral valve repair with size 26 [**Doctor Last Name 405**] annuloplasty band.
Overall the patient tolerated the procedure well and
post-operatively was transferred to the CVICU in stable
condition for recovery and invasive monitoring.  The patient was
diuresed on post operative day 1 and ventilator was weaned.
Early POD 2 found the patient extubated, alert and oriented and
breathing comfortably.  She was weaned off her vasoactive
medications on post operative day 2, including epinephrine and
Neosynephrine. Beta blocker was initiated and the patient was
gently diuresed toward the preoperative weight. She went into a
rapid atrial fibrillation and was loaded with Amiodarone in the
CVICU. The patient was transferred to the telemetry floor for
further recovery. Beta blockers were increased and Diltiazem was
added for better heart rate control. Coumadin was started for
atrial fibrillation and mechanical AVR.  She was therapeutic
with her INR at the time of discharge with a goal INR 2.5-3.5.
Chest tubes and pacing wires were discontinued without
complication. Cipro was started for a Klebsiella UTI (sensitive
to Cipro).  She was completing a 3 day course at the time of
discharge and had a repeat urine culture prior to discharge
which was pending. An echocardiogram was done on [**2-13**] and
results were pending at the time of this discharge summary. Upon
discharge Zaroxyln was stopped and Lasix was changed to 40 mg po
BID due to slight rise in BUN and creatinine.  Her fluid status
should be monitored closely and Lasix dosing is to be
reevaluated in 2 weeks based on need for further diuresis.   The
patient was evaluated by the physical therapy service for
assistance with strength and mobility.  By the time of discharge
on POD 9 the patient was ambulating with assistance, she was
tolerating a full oral diet, the wound was healing and pain was
controlled with Ultram.  The patient was discharged to [**Location (un) **]
House Rehab in [**Location (un) **] in good condition with appropriate
follow up appointment instructions and lab work instructions.
