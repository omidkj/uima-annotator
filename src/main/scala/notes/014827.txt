Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7575**]
Chief Complaint:
Increased seizure frequency.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Placement of midline intravenous line


History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 38 year old woman with a history of Rassussen's
encephalitis, s/p partial left hemispherectomy and intractable
epilepsy who was transferred from [**Hospital3 **] Hosptial for
a flurry of seizures on the day of admission.

She was recently admitted to the epilepsy service with increased
seizure frequency in the setting of enterococcal bacteremia
(UTI).  She was started on Vancomycin/Gent and her central line
was discharged. A new, left femoral line was placed.  Further
work-up included a TTE which was negative and a CT chest and
neck to evaluate for [**Hospital3 15741**] hardware infection which was also
unrevealing.  A PICC line was placed and she was discharged to a
nursing home to complete 2 week course of IV Vanco.  During her
admission, her seizure frequency decreased as her infection was
treated and she had no seizures after [**1-15**].  She was discharged
on [**1-16**].

Her mother was not pleased with the care at her NH and believes
that [**Known firstname **] was having seizures there on Saturday.  She saw at
least 3 events where she flexed her arms (right>left) and and
eyes deviated to the right or upwards.  She seemed to return to
her baseline afterwards.  Her mother reported these events to [**Name (NI) **]
staff who told her that these were not seizures (though
according to her mother, [**Name (NI) **] has had similar seizures in the
past).

This morning, [**Known firstname **] had 3 "generalized tonic-clonic" seizures
within 30 minutes each lasting about one minute.  She was found
to be febrile to 101.5.  She was given 1 mg ativan at 6:15AM
without effect.  Her [**Known firstname 15741**] magnet was not used (mother does not
believe [**Name (NI) **] has a magnet). She continued to have frequent events
and was transferred to [**Hospital6 3105**] where she had
several more seizures consisting of eye deviation to the right
and "tonic-clonic" movements of her arms.  Her mother did not
witness these events.  At the OSH, she had a head CT which was
negative.  She received 2mg IM ativan x3. Her left PICC line
appeared to be clotted and a left femoral line was placed.  1g
of IV Vanco was given.  She was then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for
further care.

According to her mother, [**Name (NI) **] has been doing fairly well
since discharge with the exception of the witnessed seizures
noted above.  She has not had cough, SOB, abdominal
pain/distention, or diarrhea since discharge.  Her usual
seizures consist of right face and arm jerking with right eye
deviation.  She usually has [**1-9**] seizures per month.  She rarely
has generalized convulsions.

Studies:
[**1-20**] CT head - Stable apperance of the brain, compared to
[**2102-7-15**]. No edema or mass effect.
.
[**1-20**] CT Chest/Abd/Pelvis - Findings consistent with right upper
lobe pneumonia.
Aspiration could be considered. No evidence of ileus or abscess.
PEG in place.
.
[**1-20**] U/S UE - DVT within the left brachial veins.  Normal RUE.
.
[**1-29**] CTA chest
1. No evidence of central, lobar, or segmental pulmonary
embolism. Limited evaluation of subsegmental pulmonary artery is
due to slow contrast injection through a central line.
2. Near complete resolution of right upper lobe consolidation
and a new consolidation in the superior segment of the right
lower lobe. These findings are suggestive of recurrent
aspiration.
.

Brief Hospital Course:
1 Epilepsy: Patient was admitted with increased frequency of
seizures and development of possible generalized tonic-clonic
seizures.  She was continued on her Keppra, Dilantin, and
Phenobarbital.  She received Ativan PRN increased frequency of
facial seizures or seizures lasting longer than 3 minutes.  Her
EEGs showed spike and wave discharges that were seen broadly
over the left hemisphere but were most prominent in the left
fronto-central region; additionally, there were episodes of
facial twitching associated with rhythmic movement artifact over
the right side of the electrode leads but no obvious
electrographic seizure (though evolution of both clinical and
EEG appearance consistent with seizures).  Clinically, the
patient did not have generalized appearance to seizures (ie,
GTCs) though on EEG monitoring, there were several apparent
electrographic seizures with a generalized distribution picked
up only on seizure detection programs.  As these did not
correlate with push-button events, it was not possible to
determine what clinical correlate occurred or how long these
events lasted.  Although she had seemed to have increased
seizure frequency both at admission and in the MICU, when she
returned to the floor, she seemed to be at her seizure baseline,
with many focal right face twitches during the day but no
generalized convulsions.  She was discharged on an
anticonvulsant regimen including keppra 1500mg po bid, phenytoin
200/100/100mg daily and phenobarbital 60/60/90mg daily.

Of note, per her neurologist, Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 437**], her seizure protocol is
as follows:
