History of Present Illness:
Mrs. [**Known lastname **] (aka "[**Known firstname 17563**]") is a 59 year old lady with a history
of breast cancer (s/p mastectomy) and PEs in [**2189**] who presented
to an OSH ED on [**2197-2-12**] unresponsive after having a productive
cough for five days. In the field, she had an O2 sat of 47%. In
the OSH ED, CXR showed LUL PNA with T of 100.3. Initial labs
were notable for CK 49, CKMB 12, TropI 0.06, ABG 7.31/78/19. She
was started on CTX/Azithro for CAP and put on BiPAP and
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]. In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, she was weaned to an NRB
and maintained her mental status. She had hemoptysis but was
guiac negative. CT showed large bilateral PEs. She received ASA
325mg PO x1, heparin IV, 1LNS, and albuterol and ativan for
respiratory distress.
Mrs. [**Known lastname **] was transferred to the MICU with VS 99.5, 94, 121/86,
12, 92%NRB. She was awake and responsive, but lethargic. She
reported feeling fine but was unclear why her husband brought
her to the hospital.
In the ICU, on [**2-12**], her oncologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 19**], was emailed about
the possibility of Mrs. [**Known lastname **]' letrozole being responsible for
her PEs. He wrote back saying OK to hold letrozole for now but
that it was unlikely the etiology. Her IV heparin was changed to
lovenox, and her diet was advanced, given her hemodynamic
stability. She was nervous and sleepless most of the night, and
called her sister repeatedly (who then called the unit). The
patient appeared to be in opiate withdrawal, so oxycodone was
increased but remained below her total home dose.
On [**2-13**], Mrs. [**Known lastname **] still required 6L of NC to maintain O2 sat in
low 90s. She remained very anxious about her narcotic regimen,
so oxycontin 20 mg [**Hospital1 **] was added. Metoprolol was held in the
setting of R heart strain; captopril 6.25mg TID was started
because SBP increased to 160s. Her husband asked for narcotics
for himself, and the house officer refused.
On [**2-14**] she was going to be called out but was still requiring
5-6L O2. She also had a mechanical fall. She was very anxious
about leaving the ICU.
She improved overnight and was called out on [**2197-2-15**]. Vitals on
transfer were: HR: 91, BP: 159/106, O2Sat: 91-97% on 2-3L NC.

Relevant studies:
[**2197-2-12**] Echo - Right ventricular cavity enlargement with free
wall hypokinesis c/w pulmonary embolism.
.
[**2197-2-13**] Echo - Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of
[**2197-2-12**], right ventricular cavity size is smaller and free wall
motion is more vigorous.
.
[**2197-2-12**] ECG - Sinus rhythm. There are non-diagnostic Q waves in
the inferior leads. Non-specific ST-T wave changes. Compared to
the previous tracing these findings are new.
.
[**2197-2-12**] CT Chest -
1. Bilateral, multifocal segmental PE, with significant clot
burden resulting in right heart strain. Emboli are seen in
vessels supplying the right upper, middle and lower lobes, and
the lingula, with extension of embolic material into multiple
peripheral vessels supplying both lungs. There are prominent
subsegmental PE in vessels supplying the posterior left lower
lobe.
2. Enlarged right ventricle and straightened intraventricular
septum
consistent with right heart strain. No pulmonary infarct at this
time.
3. Heterogeneous peribronchovascular nodules in the left upper
lobe, could
reflect hemorrhage or infectious etiology. Unlikely to represent
infarct.
Recommend re-imaging after treatment for PE.
.
[**2197-2-13**] CXR - Portable AP chest radiograph was compared to chest
CT from [**2197-2-12**]. The current study demonstrates known
opacities in the left perihilar area consistent with known
infection. Cardiomegaly is unchanged. Mediastinal position,
contour and width are stable. There is no interval development
of appreciable pleural effusion and there is no pneumothorax.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname **] is a 59 year old woman found unresponsive found to
have large bilateral PEs and a LUL PNA. She was transferred from
another hospital to [**Hospital1 18**] where she was admitted to the MICU on
[**2197-2-12**]. She was transferred to the general medicine floor for
several days and was discharged on [**2197-2-21**].
.
# Pulmonary Emboli/Left thigh hematoma: The patient had
extensive bilateral PEs with hypoxia intially requiring 5L NC.
She remained hemodynamically stable throughout her admission.
Underlying contributing factors include obesity, smoking,
history of PEs, and malignancy. She may also have a hereditary
coagulopathy. Heparin gtt was started in the ICU. LENIs were
negative for DVT. Echo showed evidence of right heart strain and
RV hypokinesis. When hemodynamics remained stable for several
hours, heparin was switched to lovenox. Oxygen requirement
improved to 3L NC prior to call-out to the medical service.
On the medicine floor, Mrs. [**Known lastname **] remained stable and she no
longer had an oxygen requirement by the week before discharge.
Around [**2-20**] the patient developed a large left groin/thigh
hematoma. On ultrasound on  [**2197-2-21**] thigh u/s showed the
hematoma to be 8 x 5 x 8 cm. She had a [**4-14**] point hematocrit
drop, that intially remained stable but on [**2-24**], her hematocrit
droppeed from 29 to 25. Her thigh was re-ultrasounded and at the
time the hematoma measured 14 x 7.6 x 6.4 cm. Because of the
hemaocrit drop and increasing size of hematoma, her lovenox was
stopped. She had an IVC filter place
