Open reduction internal fixation left periprosthetic femur
fracture.


History of Present Illness:
83 y.o woman living at ALF with h/o osteoporosis, hx of afib on
coumadin, presents s/p slip in the shower. She was in USOH prior
to the fall and does not report SOB, N/V/D dysuria/LOC. She was
found to have a severe comminuted left femur fx and was admitted
to medicine prior to surgical repair. She first presented to an
OSH before being transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]. At the OSH she received
morphine 4 mg IV x 3, zofran 4mg IV and reglan 10 mg IV.

L hip film at OSH
Comminuted fracture of the proximal and mid femoral shaft with
displacement of the femoral component of the L hip arthroplasty.

.
CXR ([**2143-4-23**])
IMPRESSION:
1. No focal consolidation.
2. Globular appearance to the heart which may be due to
patient's supine
position and AP technique, but pericardial effusion is not
excluded.
3. Degenerative change at the right shoulder joint with
sclerosis of the
right humeral head which can be seen in avascular necrosis. If
this has not been previously evaluated, recommend dedicated
imaging of the shoulder at least radiographically and consider
MRI.
.
Head CT:
No ICH.
.
Transthoracic echocardiogram ([**2143-4-23**]):
The left atrium is moderately dilated. There is moderate
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular
cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is hyperdynamic(LVEF 75%). There is a moderate resting
left ventricular outflow tract obstruction. There was no change
in the left ventricular outflow tract gradient with Valsalva
maneuver. A mid-cavitary gradient is also identified. There is
no ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and
free wall motion are normal. There are focal calcifications in
the aortic arch. The number of aortic valve leaflets cannot be
determined. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened.
Aortic stenosis is present (not quantified but probably mild).
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no
mitral valve prolapse. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
Impression: hyperdynamic left ventricle with significant left
ventricular outflow tract obstruction; probable mild aortic
stenosis .
.
EKG ([**2143-4-23**]): Atrial flutter. Consider left ventricular
hypertrophy although this is non-diagnostic. Early precordial
QRS transition. Diffuse ST-T wave changes. Findings are
non-specific. Since the previous tracing atrial flutter has
replaced sinus rhythm.

EKG ([**2143-4-22**]): Sinus rhythm with atrial premature beat.
Consider left ventricular hypertrophy although this is
non-diagnostic. Early precordial QRS transition. Modest diffuse
ST-T wave changes. Findings are non-specific, Baseline artifact
makes assessment difficult. Since the previous tracing of
