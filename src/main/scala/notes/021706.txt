History of Present Illness:
Mr [**Known lastname 1313**] was recently in our ICU for urosepsis secondary to
nephrolithiasis.  He also has a history of type II DM and
hypertension, as well as recent diagnosis of atrial fibrillation
with RVR and acute kidney injury in the setting of his
infection.

He is currently presenting secondary to having intermittent left
arm pain while at rehab.  A troponin was checked at the rehab
which was 0.4 and he was sent to our ED.  He denied chest pain,
dyspnea, diaphoresis, nausea.  He said the pain in his arm was
an "ache" rather than radiating pain.  His troponins during his
hospitalization last week have been trending downward; the
troponin checked in the ED is lower than his baseline and
continues his downward trend (it was 0.82 down from 1.1).

In the ED, his hematocrit was noted to be 25.6 compared to a
baseline of 31 at the start of his prior admission; during his
last ICU stay last week, his hematocrits have hovered around
25.6.  He has heme-positive stool in the ED, but he denies any
history of GI bleeding.  He does take NSAIDS sporadically.  He
states he has never had a colonoscopy.  Denies weakness,
dizziness, lightheadedness.  At baseline, he was ambulatory and
feeling well; since urosepsis, he has been less functional and
is very weak at the rehab, able to do minimal walking with
physical therapy.

During his last hospitalization, he was treated for urosepsis
that resulted secondary to an obstructing calculus above the UVJ
- urine cultures from OSH were reported to be greater than
100,000 colonies of E Coli resistant to Levofloxacin, Bactrim
and sensitive to all
other agents. He was planned for a two week antibiotic course.
Percutaneous nephrostomy tube was placed by IR (pt was kept
intubated for the procedure) on [**2121-5-6**].  This was complicated
by bleeding from nephrostomy tube when pt was started on heparin

gtt for afib.  IR reassessed the tube and found it to be in
calyx instead of kidney; this was replaced ON [**5-9**] and bleeding
from nephrostomy tube resolved. Creatinine > 4 on admission from

obstructive [**Last Name (un) **], now trending down to 1.4 after nephrostomy tube

placement.  Urology recommended initiation of tamsulosin and
placement of Foley after failed voiding trial, with plan to keep
Foley in place until Urology outpatient followup.  He was
discharged on IV ceftriaxone, last day = [**5-18**] for total 2 week
course.  During this hospitalization he also had significant
atrial fibrillation, new-onset, which required trial of
metoprolol, diltiazem, and esmolol drip. However, he became
hypotensive on these agents.  He was then
started on an amiodarone drip.  Given his CHADS of 3 and
increased risk of stroke with potential cardioversion on
amiodarione drip, he was started on heparin gtt. This was
complicated by bleeding from foley as well as nephrostomy tube.

He was eventually rate controlled on 50 QID metoprolol tartrate,
tansitioned to 200 metoprolol succinate on discharge.  He was
continued on heparin gtt and was initiated on coumadin the day
prior to discharge.  On discharge, he was well rate controlled
in the
90s-110s with bursts into the 130s-140s when eating breakfast or

lunch.  These rates would only last for several minutes and
patient remained stable and asymptomatic until resolution.  A
TTE was obtained that revealed EF of 35%, left ventricular
aneurysm, and possibly hypokinetic right ventricle, mild aortic
stenosis.  Cardiology recommended that he undergo non urgent
cardiac catheterization when stable.  He was started on a baby
aspirin.  His troponins were down-trending at time of his last
discharge.

At time of transfer to the MICU, he had no active complaints.
He denies active chest pain, arm pain, shortness of breath,
diaphoresis, nausea. His vitals were HR 80, BP 103/48, 100% RA,
afebrile.

FINDINGS: Single portable view of the chest is compared to
previous exam from [**2121-5-10**]. The coil previously seen in
the right-sided PICC line is no longer visualized. The right
PICC tip is now seen with tip in the upper SVC.  Otherwise,
there has been no change given differences in positioning and
technique. There is no new confluent consolidation.
Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.

IMPRESSION: Right PICC now seen without coil and tip in the
upper SVC.
Otherwise, no change. No evidence of consolidation.

Brief Hospital Course:
# Arm pain: Patient states his arm pain was a constant ache and
began after working with weights while at rehab.  The character
of the pain was not cardiac in nature, there were no ECG
changes, and his cardiac enzymes continued to downtrend from his
demand NSTEMI several weeks ago.  He is being discharged on
tramadol as needed for his pain.

# Anemia, chronic blood loss - Hct 25 upon admission; baseline
has been in the mid-20s since his first admission at the end of
[**Month (only) 547**].  Most likely this reflects anticoagulation, hematuria,
and repeated phlebotomy.  He was transfused one unit with
appropriate increase in Hct to 27/28.  He was initially guiac
positive brown stool, was guiac negative on discharge.  At this
point, he will likely need an outpatient colonoscopy.

# Recent urosepsis - Ceftriaxone was completed on [**5-18**] and
patient remained afebr
