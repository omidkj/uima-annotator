Allergies:
Penicillins / Lamictal

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1**]
Chief Complaint:
Multinodular goiter with microfollicular aspirate.


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Total thyroidectomy including substernal component via cervical
approach.
[**2127-3-31**] Re-intubation with mechanical ventilation


History of Present Illness:
62 yo F with h/o follicular adenoma, HTN, HLD, DVT x 3 on
coumadin, DM, ESRD s/p renal transplant presents after
successful total thyroidectomy for respiratory distress.
Patient presented for elective thyroidectomy this AM for an
enlarging goiter which on FNA was follicular adenoma, tolerated
procedure well and was intubated and extubated without
difficulty.  She was extubated for a few minutes and about to be
transferred to the floor, however patient became acutely short
of breath with RR in 50s, worse than laying down, also BP
elevated to 180s-200s systolic.  Patient given 10 mg IV
labetolol with improvement in BP, work of breathing not imrpoved
with 100% face mask so she was re-intubated with glidescope and
per anesthesiology noted right vocal cord dysfunction with
little movement in right vocal cord.  No difficulty noted in the
surgery regarding visualization of recurrent laryngeal nerves.
Patient was also given 20 mg IV lasix given h/o HTN and lasix
use as outpatient, CXR was done and was concerning for possible
fluid overload as well. She had received 1000 mL in crystalloid
during procedure, urine output immediately following lasix and
placement of foley catheter was 700 mL, EBL 25 mL. She was
transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for further workup of respiratory distress
and possible evaluation of vocal cord dysfunction.
On arrival to the ICU, pt is intubated and sedated, unable to
give further history.

MICROBIOLOGIC DATA:

IMAGING STUDIES:
[**2127-3-31**] CHEST (PORTABLE AP) -  An endotracheal tube terminates
5.8 cm above the carina. The lung volumes are low. Bibasilar
atelectasis is slightly worse, and central pulmonary vascular
engorgement is again seen without edema. There is no
pneumothorax, pleural effusion, or focal consolidation. ET tube
terminating 5.8 cm above the carina. Increased atelectasis since
[**25**] a.m.


Brief Hospital Course:
62F with h/o follicular adenoma, HTN, HLD, DVT x 3 on coumadin,
DM, ESRD s/p renal transplant who underwent a successful total
thyroidectomy developed respiratory distress with re-intubation
and was admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for acute respiratory concerns.Once
stabalized the patient was transferred to the floor on
postoperative day one.

# ACUTE RESPIRATORY DISTRESS - Patient developed respiratory
distress in the setting of recent surgical procedure (in the
PACU requiring re-intubation), concerning for acute pulmonary
edema given his elevated systolic BPs vs. a component of
diastolic dysfunction. Patient has strong history of DVTs in the
past and has been holding his anticoagulation in the setting of
surgery, so pulmonary embolus made the differential. Following
Lasix 20 mg IV x 1 with adequate urine output response, the
patient had improved oxygenations. Of note, there was some
question of right vocal cord paresis, but unilateral involvement
should not result in respiratory concerns. The patient improved
and actually self-extubated in the evening of [**2127-3-31**] without
re-intubation needs. Her oxygen saturations were stable.

# STATUS-POST TOTAL THYROIDECTOMY - Patient tolerated the
procedure well despite re-intubation concerns. Incision appeared
clean, dry and intact without fullness or evidence of bleeding.
East 1 surgery followed closely. Levothyroxine replacement was
started following the procedure and her calcium level was
closely monitored.

# RIGHT VOCAL CORD PARESIS - initially imaged during
reintubation after the surgery. Patient was evaluated by ENT the
next day which confirmed the finding, as well as some false
vocal cord edema and hemorrhages. She was evaluated by speech
and swallow and was cleared for regular diet. She will need to
follow up with ENT for further monitoring and management.

# ESRD STATUS-POST RENAL TRANSPLANT - We continued her home
dosing of Cellcept and Tacrolimus. Tacrolimus level was
reassuring.

# RECURRENT DEEP VENOUS THROMBOSUS HISTORY - Anticoagulation
held peri-procedurally. We resumed Coumadin in the AM on [**2127-4-1**].

# BIPOLAR DISORDER - Appeared stable. We continued her home
dosing of Clomipramine, Perphenazine, Buproprion, Clonazepam and
Abilify.

# HYPERTENSION - We continued her home dosing of Lasix and
Lisinopril following re-initiation of her PO intake.
