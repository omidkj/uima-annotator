Date of Birth:   [**2137-8-18**]     Sex:  M

Service:  Cardiothoracic Surgery

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 42-year-old male, who
presented to [**Hospital 1474**] Hospital early in the morning on
[**1-6**] with approximately one day of new onset chest
pain.  He had no nausea, vomiting, shortness of breath, or
diaphoresis.  He was treated with nitroglycerin, aspirin,
Lovenox, and he did rule in for a non-ST-elevation myocardial
infarction with CK of 1348, MB 171, and a troponin greater
than 50.  He had cardiac catheterization when he came in to
the hospital, where he was transferred in to [**Hospital1 18**].  The
cardiac catheterization revealed an ejection fraction of 25%
by echocardiogram and severe three vessel disease by cardiac
catheterization.

Cardiac catheterization revealed a 95% lesion of the right
coronary, totally occluded LAD, and totally occluded OM-2
with the circumflex.  Ejection fraction on echocardiogram was
25-30%.  CKs peaked at approximately 1300.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Tobacco abuse of approximately 30 pack years.
2. GERD.

MEDICATIONS:  He was on no medications at home, but was
transferred in from the outside hospital on the following
medications:
1. Lopressor 25 mg p.o. t.i.d.
2. Aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d.
3. Lipitor 10 mg p.o. q.d.
4. Protonix 40 mg p.o. q.d.
5. Heparin drip.
6. IV nitroglycerin drip.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Was rare for alcohol at approximately few
beers per month.  Tobacco history as above.

FAMILY HISTORY:  He had a positive family history for
coronary artery disease.  His father had a myocardial
infarction at age 32.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  On review of systems, he denied any CVA
or TIA symptoms.  He had no asthma.  He had occasionally a
nonproductive cough.  He had no other history other than
listed in the history of present illness.  He denied any GI
or GU problems as well as hematology, infectious disease, or
endocrine problems.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On examination, he was neurologically
grossly intact.  His lungs were clear bilaterally.  He had
normal cardiac sounds of S1, S2, which were regular rate and
rhythm.  His abdominal examination was benign.  His
extremities were warm and well perfused with positive
peripheral pulses.

He was referred at that time to Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1537**] of Cardiac
Surgery for coronary artery bypass grafting.

PREOPERATIVE LABORATORIES:  Sodium 140, K 3.8, chloride 111,
bicarb 23, BUN 11, creatinine 0.8 with a blood sugar of 100,
INR of 1.1.  White count 9.0, hematocrit 39.1, platelet count
of 182,000.

Preoperatively he was hemodynamically stable, and was seen by
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1537**] with a possibly of trying to wean his IV Heparin and
nitroglycerin to see if he can be pain free and come back
electively, but this did not turn out to be the case.  He did
remain on IV Heparin and IV nitroglycerin, and a plan was
made for him to stay for CABG at that time.  He had
preoperative carotid studies done which showed no significant
stenosis in either left or right carotid arteries.

On [**1-10**], he underwent coronary artery bypass grafting
x4 by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] with a LIMA to the LAD, a vein
graft sequentially to the posterior descending and
posterolateral of the right coronary and left radial artery
graft to the OM of the circumflex.  Patient was transferred
to Cardiothoracic ICU in stable condition on a Neo-Synephrine
drip at 0.3 mcg/kg/minute, nitroglycerin drip at 1
mcg/kg/minute, and a propofol drip titrated for sedation.

On postoperative day one, he had no events overnight.  He
remained on a Neo-Synephrine drip at 0.5 and nitroglycerin
drip at 0.25 for nitrate support of his radial artery.  He
had been extubated with reasonably good blood gas.  Was in
sinus rhythm in the 70s with blood pressure of 97/53, satting
94% on 5 liters nasal cannula.  Postoperatively, his white
count was 31, hematocrit 31, K 4.5, BUN 10, creatinine 0.8.
His lactate was 1.6.  His lungs were clear bilaterally.  His
heart was regular rate and rhythm.  His examination was
otherwise unremarkable.  He started oral Imdur off the IV
nitroglycerin again for support of his radial artery graft as
an antispasmodic.  Lasix diuresis was begun, and he was
transferred out to [**Hospital Ward Name 121**] 2.

He was alert and oriented, and was receiving some Toradol for
pain.  He was also given levofloxacin additional antibiotic
coverage.  He was hemodynamically stable with a white count
of 8.3, and a hematocrit of 27.2.  He remained in sinus
rhythm with occasional premature ventricular contractions and
continued to maintain a good blood pressure of 121/58 with
unremarkable laboratories.  Lactate dropped to 0.9.  Chest
tubes were discontinued, and he did transfer out to [**Hospital Ward Name 121**] 2 on
postoperative day two.  He was seen by Physical Therapy for
evaluation to start his ambulation.

On postoperative day three, he did do well overnight.  He did
have some shortness of breath on exertion.  He was stable.
Had an episode of atrial fibrillation.  Was satting 94% on
room air.  Was alert and oriented.  Pacer wires were tapped.
Hematocrit rose slightly to 31.6 with a creatinine of 0.9.
He continued to do well.  He was monitored very closely for
his oxygen saturations with exertion.  His pacing wires were
discontinued later in the day.  He continued to ambulate with
Physical Therapy and the nursing staff, and his diet was
advanced with a plan for him to do a level five with Physical
Therapy on the following day.  He was also seen by case
management.  Decision was made that the patient could be
evaluated by PT and probably discharged to home given his
activity level and young age.

He was ambulating independently on the evening of [**1-13**], and continued to saturate approximately 93% on 2 liters
nasal prongs.  He was in sinus rhythm again with rate
premature ventricular contractions.

On [**1-14**], he did do level 5 stairs with PT done, and
he was discharged to home in good condition.

DI[**Last Name (STitle) 408**]E INSTRUCTIONS:  Follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 6160**], his
primary care physician in approximately 1-2 weeks in the
office and to see Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] for postoperative surgical
visit at one month in the office.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1. Metoprolol 50 mg p.o. b.i.d.
2. Lasix 20 mg p.o. q.d. x1 week.
3. Potassium chloride supplements 20 mEq p.o. q.d. x1 week.
4. Lipitor 10 mg p.o. q.d.
5. Aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d.
6. Ambien 5 mg q.h.s. as needed.
7. Percocet 1-2 tablets q.4-6h. prn for pain.
8. Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d.

His final chest x-ray showed resolution of his CHF and good
aeration, but slight left basilar atelectasis.  He was alert
and oriented.  Was satting approximately 89% on room air,
which was not far from his baseline.  His wounds are clean,
dry, and intact.  His heart was regular rate and rhythm and
bilateral lungs are clear to auscultation.  He had no
clubbing, cyanosis, or edema, and was ambulating well.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1. Status post coronary artery bypass grafting x4.
2. Myocardial infarction.
3. History of tobacco abuse.
4. Gastroesophageal reflux disease.

Ag[**Last Name (STitle) 53446**] was discharged to home in stable condition with
instructions to followup with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 6160**] and Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) 411**], and he was discharged on [**1-14**].
