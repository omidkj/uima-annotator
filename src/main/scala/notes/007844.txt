History of Present Illness:
HPI:
Mr. [**Known lastname 11753**] is a 68 YOM with COPD (on 2-4L O2 baseline), CLL,
hypertension, PE (on coumadin c/b recent GI bleed [**4-23**] requiring
4 units pRBCs), chronic systolic heart failure (EF 35%), atrial
fibrillation, and recent admission for Enterococcus faecalis
bacteremia treated with ampicillin, who was admitted from rehab
facility on [**2185-5-12**] for hypotension, lethargy, and fever.
.
Of note, E. faecalis during prior admission was treated with
ampicillin. Antibiotics were completed [**2185-4-30**], however his PICC
was retained.  He then had chills and night sweats during night
for 3 days preceding admission. During this time he became
febrile to 102 on [**2185-5-10**], and PICC was removed [**2185-5-11**]. Blood
culture drawn on [**2185-5-10**] at rehab reportedly grew GPC in chains.
CXR, UA were reportedly negative. On [**2185-5-12**] the patient was
noted to have SBP in the mid-80s (baseline 110-130s) with
tachypnea and increased oxygen requirement (baseline 88-90% on
NC 3-5L). Vancomycin was considered but not given due to no IV
access.  He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].
.
In the ED, sBP 94, RR 26, HR 120s (irregularly irregular).
Blood, urine cultures sent. He received Unasyn, levofloxacin,
and NS 800cc. On arrival to floor from ED he was hypoxic with
oxygen saturation in upper 70s and was found to have atrial
fibrillation with RVR (rate 120-130s), tachypnea, and increasd
crackles. Oxygen was increased to 6L by nasal cannula with rapid
improvement of oxygen saturation to 95%. ABG 7.50 // 30 // 58.
He was transferred to the MICU.

The left atrium is mildly dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity
size are normal. There is moderate global left ventricular
hypokinesis (LVEF = 35%). There is considerable beat-to-beat
variability of the left ventricular ejection fraction due to an
irregular rhythm/premature beats. The right ventricular cavity
is moderately dilated with moderate global free wall
hypokinesis. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The a
