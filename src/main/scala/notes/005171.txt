History of Present Illness:
Please see nightfloat H&P for full HPI, PMH, meds, SH, FH.
Briefly, pt is a 72 y/o African-American M with CRI, h/o
nephrolithiasis, who presented with weakness. His weakness has
been progressive over the week prior to admission, is present in
his upper and lower extremities, makes it difficult for him to
stand, and is accompanied by pain. He reports inability to grasp
objects with his hands and he feels that his fingers are stiff.
He has never experienced this before. He also had a recent
episode of 2 days of abdominal pain, starting at his umbilicus
and then moving to his RLQ. This was accompanied by N/V x 1. It
has been resolved for 2-3 days and was not accompanied by a
change in bowels. He has chronically loose bowels which have
worsened over the past 2 months. He has loose stools after each
meal, up to 10x per day. He denies BRBPR, melena.

Reports:
LIVER OR GALLBLADDER US (SINGLE ORGAN)  [**2104-7-18**] 6:55 PM
FINDINGS: Grayscale evaluation of the liver demonstrates
diffusely increased echogenicity without focal hepatic lesions
or masses. There is no intra- or extra-hepatic biliary dilation.
The CBD measures 7 mm appropriate for patient's age. There is no
choledocholithiasis. There is a 1.3 cm gallbladder stone without
pericholecystic fluid or gallbladder wall edema to indicate
acute cholecystitis. Son[**Name (NI) 493**] [**Name2 (NI) 515**] sign was absent.
The extrahepatic portal vein is patent with wall-to-wall
hepatopetal flow and normal waveform. However, there is
prominent perihepatic collateral vessels extending into the
porta hepatis, which may replace the main portal vein suggesting
possible cavernous transformation of the portal venous system.
The limited visualization of the renal parenchyma demonstrates
normal echogenicity.
IMPRESSION:
1. Diffusely echogenic liver may represent fatty infiltration;
however, more advanced liver disease including cirrhosis and
advanced fibrosis cannot be excluded on this study.
2. Prominent perihepatic collateral apparently immediately
distal to the extrahepatic and possibly replacing the main
portal vein raise the possibility of cavernous transformation of
the portal vein, related to underlying chronic portal
hypertension.
3. Cholelithiasis without acute cholecystitis.
4. Normal echogenicity of right renal parenchyma argues against
chronic medical renal disease (could the patient's acute renal
failure reflect hepatorenal syndrome?)
.
CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2104-7-18**] 7:07 PM
PA AND LATERAL VIEW, CHEST: The lungs are clear. There are no
focal consolidations. There is no pleural effusion or
pneumothorax. Minimal atelectasis is noted at the left lower
lobe. Cardiomediastinal silhouette and pulmonary vasculature is
normal. The aorta is markedly elognated and unfolded. The
pulmonary vasculature is unremarkable without evidence of
pulmonary edema. There is diffuse osteopenia with loss of height
of mid thoracic vertebra ad resultant kyphosis.
IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary process.
.
ECG Study Date of [**2104-7-18**]  5:33:52 PM
Sinus rhythm. Possible old inferior myocardial infarction. Left
anterior
fascicular block. Intraventricular conduction delay. No previous
tracing
available for comparison.
TRACING #1
.
ECG Study Date of [**2104-7-19**]  3:07:12 AM
Sinus rhythm. Occasional premature atrial contractions. Compared
to the
previous tracing atrial ectopy is new.
TRACING #2
.
RENAL U.S.  [**2104-7-20**] 8:37 AM
RENAL ULTRASOUND: Bilateral sub-1.6 cm kidney cysts are noted.
The right kidney measures 8.9 cm without evidence of
hydronephrosis, stone or mass. the left kidney measures 9.8 cm,
evidence of hydronephrosis, stone or mass. An enlarged prostate
measuring 5.1 x 5.4 x 6.6 cm and encroaches into the bladder.
The spleen measures 12.9 cm and is otherwise unremarkable. There
is cholelithiasis without evidence of cholecystitis.
IMPRESSION:
1. No hydronephrosis.
2. A large prostate protrudes into the bladder.
.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2104-7-21**] 9:14 AM
The recently placed left PICC distal tip probably projects at
the expected location of the mid SVC. No pneumothorax, pleural
effusion or focal consolidation is noted. The cardiac silhouette
and hilar contours are normal. The aorta is tortuous.
IMPRESSION:
Satisfactory position of left PICC with no complication.
--------------------
V/Q Scan:
IMPRESSION: The above findings are consistent with a moderate to
high
likelihood of pulmonary embolism.

Colonoscopy: normal.  Stricture at ileocolonic anastamosis,
unable to pass scope through.

Pathology:
A. Anastomotic area:
1. Fragment of enteric mucosa with fibrosis, atrophic changes
and active inflammation involving the surface epithelium.

2. Fragment of unremarkable colonic mucosa.
B. Random:
Fragments of unremarkable colonic mucosa.

Upper endoscopy: Erythema and congestion of the mucosa were
noted in the stomach. These findings are compatible with
gastritis. Cold forceps biopsies were performed for histology at
the stomach antrum. 3 cords of grade 1 varicees.  Pathology
revealed chronic active gastritis with H pylori present.
.
Endoscopic ultrasound:
EUS was performed using a linear echoendoscope at 7.5 MHz
frequency: The head of the pancreas were imaged from the
duodenal bulb and the second duodenum. The body and tail were
imaged from the gastric body and fundus. The uncinate process of
the pancreas could not be imaged.

Pancreas parenchyma: The parenchyma in the uncinate pancreas was
homogenous, with a normal ??????salt and pepper?????? appearance. No
discrete mass lesions or changes suggestive of chronic
pancreatitis were noted.

Pancreas duct: The pancreas duct measured 3 mm in maximum
diameter in the head of the pancreas and 1.7 mm in maximum
diameter in the body of the pancreas. The duct was normal in
echotexture and contour. No intra-ductal stones were noted. No
dilated side-branches were noted.

Multiple, dilated, tortuous abnormal vessels were noted in the
portal hepatis. These may represent varices or cavernous
transformation of the portal vein.

Duodenum mucosal biopsy:
No diagnostic abnormalities recognized, but nearly all the
surface epithelium has been stripped off and is not present for
evaluation of villous architecture.  Multiple levels have been
examined.


Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 72 yo male with CRI, s/p colectomy for Crohn's disease,
nephrolithiasis who presents with acute renal failure and
hepatitis.

#Diarrhea: Acute on chronic by history. Patient reported
frequent loose stools for many years at home (since his bowel
resection) and could not recall any
