Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 28221**] was evaluated by the Acute care service in the
Emergency Room and based on her abdominal CT and physical exam
she was admitted to the hospital with plans to repair her hiatal
hernia.  She had a nasogastric tube placed for decompression and
was hydrated with IV fluids. Her Coumadin was stopped in light
of her upcoming surgery.

On [**2160-5-6**] she was taken to the Operating Room and underwent a
[**Doctor Last Name **] procedure for paraesophageal hernia repair, cholecystectomy
and repair of abdominal wall hernia with incarcerated omentum.
She tolerated the procedure well and returned to the TSICU in
stable condition. She remained intubated but was easily weaned
and extubated on the night of surgery. She required vigorous
fluid resuscitation post op and maintained normal renal
function. Her chest xray showed some signs of pulmonary edema
although her oxygen saturations were adequate.  She was gently
diuresed with a lasix drip, maintained stable hemodynamics and
adequate oxygenation.

Following transfer to the Surgical floor she began to make good
progress.  She gradually advanced her diet though in moderation
and was started on Marinol to help her appetite.  Her G Tube was
clamped and will remain in place and can be used for tube
feedings if her intake is inadequate.  Her abdominal wound is
dry and healing well.  On [**2160-5-11**] she had a large about of
drainage from her G tube and was transferred back to the ICU
briefly for serial hematocrits. Her hematocrit was in the 24-26
range and remained stable.  There was no fluctuation in
hemodynamics and she returned to the Surgical floor.  Her G tube
remained clamped and her diet resumed without difficulty. Her
blood sugars were well controlled with diet alone and her
metformin has not been restarted.

She was evaluated by the Physical Therapy service who
recommended short term rehab to increase her mobility, improve
her balance and increase her stamina.  After a prolonged
hospital stay she was transferred to rehab on [**2160-5-13**] and will
follow up in the [**Hospital 2536**] Clinic in [**3-13**] weeks.  She will follow up
with her PCP to discuss restarting Coumadin after she returns
home. This patient was cared for by the rotating attending
services of the acute care surgical service.
