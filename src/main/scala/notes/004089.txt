Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Codeine / Penicillins / Aspirin / Fentanyl

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2605**]
Chief Complaint:
Foreign body aspiration

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Bronchoscopy

History of Present Illness:
81yo F w/ MMP including lung cancer s/p RML and LUL lobectomies,
with new L hilar mass and R base mass, who was eating lunch at
her [**Hospital3 **] facility today when she aspirated what she
thought was a piece of lamb. She was seen in the nursing station
at her [**Hospital3 **] facility and was felt to be doing OK, so
was sent to her room. However 15 mins later, the pt's aide noted
that she had a lot of frothy white sputum, was abdominal
breathing, and was not talking much. Her color also looked off.
Her O2 sats were only 70% at the time and she was unable to talk
(her speech was very garbled). She was taken to the [**Hospital1 18**] ER for
evaluation by EMS. EMS had her on 15L by NRB. On arrival to the
hospital, her sats were only in the 60s on a NRB. She was given
another combivent nebulizer w/o improvement. CXR revealed no
radioopaque objects in her trachea. Her sats began to drop into
the 50s and she was tachypneic to the 30s, usuing accessory
muscles of respiration. She was noted to be AAOx3 and agreed to
be intubated. She was given ativan, etomidate, and
succinylcholine. After intubation, her sats improved to the 90s
and she was stabilized on the vent. She was transferred to the
MICU for bronchoscopy and retrieval of the foreign body.
Bronchoscopy revealed an object lodged in the R main bronchus.
Multiple attempts were made at obtaining the food particles, but
2 mushrooms were eventually dislodged. She continued to do well
post-bronchscopy but the decision was made to keep her intubated
in case repeat bronchoscopy was needed in the AM to insure that
all food particles had been retrieved.

Past Medical History:
# Lung cancer
- s/p RUL lobectomy in [**2169**] for bronchoalveolar carcinoma
- s/p segemental resection of posterior segment of LUL in [**2173**]

resp failure post bronch requiring ventilation (? [**1-20**] muscle
rigidity from fentanyl)
- path of [**2184-1-22**] mass = infiltrating adenoca w/ papillary
features
- then found L hilar mass -> 6 cycles chemo w/ navelbine + XRT
- L hilar mass enlarged, plus new mass at R lung base (20 x
13mm)
- opted for no further treatment

EKG: sinus, rate 90, normal intervals, normal axis, LAE
(biphasic P waves in V1-V2), no Q waves, no ST or TW changes
.
CXR [**2185-9-14**]: Compared with [**2184-12-8**], the patchy infiltrates in
the right lung have cleared, but the region of clustered linear
opacities in the left upper lung field are still present, either
more confluent or smaller in size. No acute infiltrates or
obvious CHF or effusions.
The patient is status post lower anterior cervical spine fusion,
with her chin somewhat low in position at this time. Whether
this is a fixed posture or not is uncertain.
.
CXR [**2185-9-14**]: (my read) R line clear, L hilar mass, ETT 2 mm
above carina, normal heart size

Brief Hospital Course:
81 yo F w/ h/o lung cancer not amenable to treatment, dementia
and prior CVAs s/p mult. aspirations, htn, CRI presented w/
hypoxic respiratory failure [**1-20**] aspiration now moving towards
palliative care management.

In the MICU, she continued to do well post-bronchoscopy and was
extubated on [**2185-9-15**]. She has had excellent O2 saturations
averaging 96% on room air during the day. However, she has
required 2L NC overnight while in the MICU. Her MICU course has
been significant for hypertension. She has been NPO with h/o
recurrent aspirations in the past and has had an NG tube in
which she has removed several times, not because she is delerius
but because she doesn't like i
