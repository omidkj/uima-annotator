NEUROLOGIC:  Nonfocal.

ADMISSION LABS:  White blood cells 16.6, hemoglobin 13.7,
hematocrit 40.6, platelets 365,000.  PT 12.5, PTT 22.1, INR
1.0.  Sodium 137, potassium 4.1, chloride 106, CO2 20, BUN

IMAGING:  Chest x-ray not ordered.  Electrocardiogram not
ordered.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the hospital on
[**2200-9-18**].  He underwent an urgent arteriogram which showed an
occluded right femoral peroneal bypass [**Date Range **].  TPA was
started.  Repeat arteriogram on [**2200-9-19**] after TPA overnight
showed the proximal anastomosis of the right femoral to
peroneal bypass [**Date Range **] wide open all the way down to the level
of the distal anastomosis.  A small amount of blood clots
were noted in the distal [**Date Range **].  No outflow was identified.
A guidewire could not be passed into the peroneal artery.
TPA was continued.

Post angiogram, the patient developed bleeding and small
hematoma of the right groin around the sheath.  This was
treated by compression by the interventional radiology team.
TPA and heparin were discontinued.  It was felt that the
[**Date Range **] would reocclude without further thrombolytic treatment.
The patient was treated with fresh frozen plasma,
cryoprecipitate and packed red blood cells.  Admission
hematocrit had been 40.  His post transfusion hematocrit was
32.  His fibrinogen level returned to [**Location 213**].  After the
sheaths were pulled, there was no further bleeding.  The
right groin hematoma was stable.  Ultrasound of the right
groin on [**2200-9-19**] showed no pseudoaneurysm.

The patient had severe pain in his right leg which required
oral Dilaudid for control.  He also received several doses of
intravenous Toradol with good effect.  The patient was
advised that his only option was a right below the knee
amputation.  He reluctantly agreed, but wanted to be
discharged home to take care of family issues.  The patient
agreed to return for surgery in approximately one to two
weeks after discharge.  He was given a prescription for
Percocet for pain control at time of discharge.

At time of discharge, the patient had an ecchymotic right
groin with a stable hematoma.  Femoral pulses were palpable
bilaterally.  He had a dopplerable right PT pulse.  There was
no dopplerable right DP pulse.  The patient had diminished
capillary refill of his toes.  His right fifth metatarsal
ulceration was dry and stable.

1.  Combivent 2 puffs q.i.d. prn
2.  Lipitor 40 mg p.o. q hs
3.  Folic acid 1 mg p.o. q.d.

discontinuation of thrombolysis secondary to right groin
hematoma
