Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2074**]
Chief Complaint:
R total knee arthoplasty

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
1. Primary right total knee arthroplasty.


History of Present Illness:
59 year old female with breast cancer status-post bilateral
mastectomies in [**2120**], complicated by subsequent non-ischemic
dilated cardiomyopathy related to adriamycin toxicity, admitted
for elective R TKA. She was initially admitted on [**2126-12-4**]
for elective TKA. She was admitted to ICU post operatively and
did well. She was called out to the general orthopedics floor on
POD #2. At that point, she developed onset of SOB and
lightheaded, without chest pain. Pulsus was paradoxical to 20,
but otherwise hemodynamically stable. Stat transthoracic
echocardiogram showed no pericardial effusion, 2+ mitral
regurgitation and tricuspid regurgitation, mild pulmonary
hypertension, global hypokinesis, and EF 30-35%. Review of
systems negative for PND, orthopnea, or DOE (activity limited by
knee).

Past Medical History:
History of breast cancer - b/l mastectomy; tx with adriomycin,
taxol, XRT
Congestive heart failure/CM- EF 25%; [**12-26**] adriomycin
Gastric ulcers.
Cecal ulcer.
Gastrointestinal bleed [**2123**]
Cervical spondylosis.

History of gram-negative sepsis.
History of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia - tx with
amioderone.
Hypertension.
Vein stripping.
Left knee arthroplasty.
Right parotid tumor.
Chronic renal failure.
Hyponatremia
Thyroid cyst


Social History:
Pt lives in [**Location 47**] with husband and son. Non [**Name2 (NI) 1818**]


Family History:
n/c

Physical Exam:
Vital signs: T 97.9, BP 115/58, HR 89, RR 20, O2 sat 100% 3.5L;
pulsus to 15 on transfer to [**Hospital Unit Name 196**] service
HEENT: PERRL, EOMI, oropharynx clear
CV: Regular rate and rhythm, S1, S2, II/VI systolic murmur at
apex
Chest: Scattered wheezes on right, otherwise clear BS
bilaterally
Abdomen: Soft, NT, +BS
Extr: Mild edema on right, right knee dressing clean, dry,
intact
Neuro: Alert and oriented x 3, non-focal

Pertinent Results:
TTE ([**2126-12-6**]): The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left
ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There
is moderate global left ventricular hypokinesis. No masses or
thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. Right ventricular
chamber size is normal with mild global free wall hypokinesis.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with
good leaflet excursion. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. Moderate (2+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. Moderate [2+] tricuspid
regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

Compared with the report of the prior study (tape unavailable
for review) of [**2126-3-19**], global left ventricular ssytolic
function is slightly improved and the left ventricular cavity is
smaller, the severity of mitral regurgitation is slightly worse,
and the estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is lower.

R KNEE FILMS:
Right knee: Two views show new total knee arthroplasty without
complication. Small amount of cement is seen adjacent to the
medial tibial tray. Skin staples are in place. There is
post-surgical soft tissue swelling with joint effusion.


Brief Hospital Course:
Initial impression: Patient underwent total right knee
arthroplasty, which she tolerated well. She was admitted to the
ICU post-operatively for monitoring of fluid status by right
heart catheterization. She did well and was called out to the
floor on POD #2. On POD #3, she developed onset of shortness of
breath and lightheadedness, but denied chest pain. A pulsus
pardoxus of 20 was documented. She was otherwise hemodynamically
stable. A stat echocardiogram was signficant for no pericardial
effusion (results detailed above). Her elevated pulsus was
presumed to have been exagerated by her subjective dyspnea. She
was transferred to the cardiology service for monitoring. She
was transfused 2 units of pRBCs with lasix, and noted
improvement in her dyspnea and LH. She was continued on her
outpatient CHF medication regimen and remained clinically
euvolemic. Her oxygen saturations remained > 93% on room air.
Her echocardiogram was otherwise significant for improvement in
her EF, as well as improvement in her known pulmonary artery
hypertension. She was also continued on her outpatient regimen
of Aromasin while hospitalized. She received standard post-TKA
care with physical therapy and Lovenox DVT prophylaxis. She was
discharged to rehab in stable condition.
