CT TRACHEA W/O C W/RECONS  [**2141-5-3**] 1:58 PM
[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
42 year old man with trachemomalacia
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
Need dynamic CT of airways to evaluate for tracheomalacia
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.

INDICATION: 42-year-old man with tracheomalacia.

TECHNIQUE: Contiguous 2-mm axial CT images of the chest were
obtained without the administration of IV contrast [**Doctor Last Name 360**].
Additional images at dynamic expiration, at end-expiration, and
during cough were obtained. Multiplanar reformations are
reconstructed.

COMPARISON: CT trachea dated [**2140-8-7**].

FINDINGS: Again note is made of tracheomegaly, transverse
diameter measuring 2.6 cm. Note is made of thickening of
tracheal wall with calcification, which somewhat obscures
posterior membrane. At end-expiration and dynamic breathing,
note is made of excessive collapsibility of trachea and
bilateral main stem bronchus, representing severe
tracheobronchomalacia. Note is made of multiple areas of air
trapping at end-expiration.

There is no mediastinal or hilar lymphadenopathy. Note is made
of coronary artery calcification.

The limited evaluation of upper portion of the lungs
demonstrates non- calcified pulmonary nodules measuring 3 mm in
diameter in the superior segment of right lower lobe, unchanged
since [**2140-1-14**]. Previously-noted multiple patchy opacities
appear to be resolved. Again note is made of focal thickening of
right major fissure.

There is no suspicious lytic or blastic lesion noted in the
skeletal structures within the scan area.

IMPRESSION:
1. Severe tracheobronchomalacia.
2. Mild tracheomegaly with tracheal wall thickening with
calcification. The wall thickening of the trachea may be due to
relapsing polychondritis, or due to prior stenting provided in
the history. Please correlate clinically with the patient
history and also with physical findings.
3 Unchanged appearance of 3-mm non-calcified nodule in the right
lower lobe.
4. Coronary artery calcification.
5. Air trapping.
Multiplanar reformation images confirmed the above finding.

The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

SHOULDER 1 VIEW LEFT PORT  [**2141-5-11**] 10:17 PM
[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
42 year old man s/p tracheoplasty - now with pain
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
? fracture
HISTORY: Shoulder pain.

This exam consists of internal and external rotation frontal
radiographs of the left shoulder. Additional views not ordered
or obtained. No fracture or bone destruction. On limited views
available, I cannot entirely exclude anterior subluxation of the
humerus (doubtful). No periarticular soft tissue calcifications
and no comparison exams.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2141-5-14**] 8:28 AM

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
42 yo male s/p CT removal
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
Eval for PTX
INDICATION: 42-year-old male patient, status post chest tube
removal.

COMMENTS: Portable AP radiograph of the chest is reviewed and
compared with the previous study of yesterday.

The right chest tube has been removed. No pneumothorax is
identified. There is continued small loculated right pleural
effusion with subcutaneous emphysema in the right chest wall.

The tracheostomy tube, right jugular IV catheter, and
right-sided PICC line remain in place. The left lung appears
clear. There is continued mild cardiomegaly.

IMPRESSION: No pneumothorax.

Brief Hospital Course:
42y/o w/ complex medical and surgical history admitted  [**2141-5-3**]
for evaluation of increased difficulty breathing and increased
secretions w/ trachealmalacia and s/p tracheoplasty.
Bronchoscopy done- severe TBM, right mainstem patent, left
mainstem patent, BAL of RLL. Placed on antibiotics for
prophylaxis of increased secretions. BAL pending. Pt maintained
on antibiotics, receiving aggressive nutritional (TPN), CPT,
physical therapy support, and PICC line placement ([**5-5**]) in
preparation for re-do tracheoplasty done [**2141-5-11**].
Episode of conjuctivitis [**2141-5-9**] treated w/ 4-7 days of
Erythromycin opthal ointment and ciprofloxacin optahlmic
solution.
[**5-11**]- s/p re-do tracheoplasty via R thoracotomy (7-8 hour
surgery- see operative note), stable post-op, tracheostomy #8
portex in place on ventilator and transferred to SICU. Pain
service consulted, controlled to fentanyl/bupivicaine.1%
epidural as well as fentanyl gtt Bronchoscopy POD#1> mild edema,
repair successful, small amt of secretions-cleared via scope
(see report).
C/O and observation of significant L shoulder (AC joint) pain,
tenderness, swelling after being in Left lateral decub position
for duration of surgery via Right thoracotomy.  Seen by Ortho-
diagnosis of L shoulder rhabdomyelosis, w/ CPK's peaking [**5-12**]
and starting to decrease.
POD#2 Continues on ventilator SIMV +PS w/ good ABG. Vent weaned
w/o complication to trach mask, chest tube d/c. Pain control
continues w/ Fentanyl epidural and fentanyl gtt.
POD#3 [**5-14**]- Foley removed, transitioned off fentanyl drip to
meperidine and fentanyl patch, heplocked except for TPN.
Epidural catheder removed.  CK continued to decline.
POD#4 [**5-15**]- Pt transfered to floor after d/c of fentynal drip.
Pain control on floor optimized.  Trach
