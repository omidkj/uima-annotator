History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 38 year old man with presumed EtOH cirrhosis who
presents from an OSH after being found down at home. Per OSH ED
records, EMS was called by a landscaper who found the pt on the
floor in his own feces and urine, confused. Pt recalls falling,
denies head trauma or LOC. Unclear how long he was down. House
in "state of disgust" per EMT. He was brought to the [**Hospital 1562**]
hospital ED. At the OSH, BP was stable, HR in the 110-120s. Hct
was 15. Head CT negative. She was given 1 unit RBC, unasyn,
banana bag, and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.
.
Per outpatient notes, liver disease was first recognized by his
PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**2135**]. He is a heavy alcohol drinker, drinking [**4-20**] gallon
bottles of wine daily for many years. He made one attempt at
rehab in [**2134**] and was reportedly sober for 1 year, but has since
relapsed. Over the past 6 months or so, he has been having
worsening abdominal distention, leg swelling. He has been having
progressive difficulty walking secondary to weakness. He was
seen by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] at [**Hospital1 112**] in the past 2-3 months and work-up of
his liver disease has been started. Per Dr.[**Name (NI) 79913**] notes, he has
poor PO intake, weight loss of 60-80 lbs over the past 6 months,
daily vomiting (?hematemesis). [**Name (NI) 1094**] father also notes history of
blood in stool and urine over the past few weeks. Lab work-up
and diagnostic para were done however we do not have results
currently. Also, pt was referred to hepatology and also [**Hospital **]
rehab but has not followed through. Has never been hospitalized.

.
In the ED, initial vitals were T 99.4, BP 125/69, HR 126, RR 22,
93% on 4L. Labs here were notable for Hct 17.5, CK 935. Guaiac
positive. Diagnostic paracentesis was performed with results
consistent with SBP. He was given a dose of vancomycin and 1
unit RBC. Admitted to the MICU for further evaluation and
monitoring.
.
On the floor, he has no complaints. BP has dropped as low as 70s
systolic but is responsive to fluids.
.
Review of sytems:
(+) Per HPI
(-) Denies fever, chills, night sweats, recent weight loss or
gain. Denies headache, sinus tenderness, rhinorrhea or

      SERRATIA MARCESCENS.    RARE GROWTH.
         This organism may develop resistance to third
generation
         cephalosporins during prolonged therapy. Therefore,
isolates that
         are initially susceptible may become resistant within
three to
         four days after initiation of therapy.  For serious
infections,
         repeat culture and sensitivity testing may therefore be
warranted
         if third generation cephalosporins were used.
