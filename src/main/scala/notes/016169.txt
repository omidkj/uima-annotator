Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was admitted and underwent cardiac catheterization
which was signficant for left main and severe three vessel
coronary artery disease. Angiography revealed a right dominant
system with 50% distal left main lesion; 70% ostial stenosis in
the left anterior descending; 90% stenosis in the circumflex
involving the first obtuse marginal; and 70% lesion in the mid
right coronary artery. Ventriculography showed only trace mitral
regurgitations with an LVEF around 50%. Based on the above
results, cardiac surgery was consulted and further evaluation
was performed. A preoperative chest x-ray was notable for a new
right lower lobe opacity which will require further evaluation
as an outpatient. Workup was otherwise unremarkable and he was
cleared for surgery.

On [**2174-9-29**], Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] performed three vessel coronary artery
bypass grafting. This operation was performed off pump. Surgery
was uneventful and he transferred to the CSRU in stable
condition. Within 24 hours, he awoke neurologically intact and
was extubated without incident. He required diuresis and
aggressive chest PT while steroid therapy was resumed. Serial
chest x-rays were notable for subcutaneous emphysema in the left
hemithorax with a small left apical pneumothorax. He otherwise
maintained stable hemodynamics and eventually transferred to the
SDU. Steroid therapy was gradually tapered. He remained afebrile
but was empirically started on antibiotics for positive sputum
culture for Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Postoperatively, he was
noted to have a persistent leukocytosis - most likely
steroid-induced. Beta blockade was slowly advanced as tolerated.
He remained in a normal sinus rhythm. At discharge, his apical
pneumothorax remained stable while oxygen saturations remained
96% on 3L. Over several days, he worked with physical therapy
and continued to make clinical improvements. Medical therapy was
optimized and he was eventually cleared for rehab on
postoperative day seven. He will need to complete his
antibiotics at rehab and continue to require several more days
of gentle diuresis. He will eventually need to follow up with
his pulmonologist and require outpatient CT scan to further
evaluate his new right lower lobe lung opacity.
