History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 916**] is a 66 year old man with CKD (baseline Cr 1.7-2), CAD,
chronic back pain and recent hospitalization after a fall with
altered mental status and acute on chronic renal failure who
presents from home with weakness. Patient was discharged from
rehab two weeks ago. Was initially doing well at home, but
started having difficulty getting up and being active for a
week. Per report, increased confusion, waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] in
nature, over the last couple of days. VNA came to his home
yesterday and drew labs which were notable for a elevated
creatinine of 3.59 and hyperkalemia. He was brought to the ED
for further evaluation and management.
.
In the ED, initial vs were: T 97.3 HR78 BP113/55 RR16 O2 sat95%
RA. Initial ED labs were otherwise notable for K of 7.4,
creatinine of 6.4 and BUN of 106. EKG with peaked T waves.
Patient received kayexelate, calcium gluconate, bicarb, 10 units
of insulin and 1 amp D50 with minimal improvement of K to 4.9
(after an interval increase to 8.8). Renal was consulted and
recommended renal u/s, more D50 with bicarb, and placement of an
HD line for emergent dialysis. Three hours into his ED visit an
EKG was done, which was remarkable for ST elevations in the
inferior leads, II, III, aVF. Initial cardiac markers were
notable for troponin 3.70, CK 3965 and MB 82. Repeat troponin 3
hours later was 4.03. He was given aspirin 81, but given guaic
positive stool heparin and plavix was held. Cardiology was
notified and deferred catheterization secondary to time elapsed
and his multiple other co-morbidities. Other notable labs from
the ED included an initial WBC was 15 with 93% neutrophils. UA
was notably dirty with >50 WBCs and a lactate of 2.2. Patient
had a pH of 7.23 with an anion gap of 18. Patient's blood
pressures dropped to 80s/50s, he received 3 liters of fluid in
boluses and he was started on dopamine and neo. Pressures
improved to 110s. Patient's sat's started to drop and he was
showing signs of increased WOB. He was subsequently intubated
with rocuronium and etomidate. LIJ HD catheter was placed. He
was given a dose of Vancomycin and CTX for presumed urosepsis.
.
VS prior to transfer were afebrile, HR129 BP113/74 O2 sat 100%
on vent. In the MICU, patient was intubated. Patient underwent
beside echo with akinesis of inferior wall, EF of about 40%.
.
Review of systems: Unable to obtain given to patient's altered
mental status.

STUDIES:
[**2131-3-22**] EKG: Sinus rhythm. Inferior ST elevation myocardial
infarction. Compared to the previous tracing of [**2131-1-31**]
myocardial infarction pattern is new.
.
[**2131-3-22**] CXR: Mild cardiomegaly, but no acute intrathoracic
process.
.
[**2131-3-23**] TTE (Bedside): Left ventricular wall thicknesses are
normal. The left ventricular cavity size is top
normal/borderline dilated. LV systolic function appears
depressed (ejection fraction 30%) secondary to severe
hypokinesis/akinesis of the inferior and posterior walls. The
right ventricular cavity is dilated with depressed free wall
contractility. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally
normal with good leaflet excursion. The mitral valve leaflets
are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. There
is no pericardial effusion.
Impression: inferior posterior infarction; right ventricular
infarction
.
[**2131-3-23**] EKG: Sinus tachycardia. Inferior ST segment elevations
with rare reciprocal precordial depressions are suggestive of
inferoposterior myocardial infarction. Compared to the previous
tracing ST-T wave changes are more extensive.
.
[**2131-3-23**] Renal U/S: Atrophy of the right kidney is unchanged. The
left kidney is normal. No hydronephrosis or mass noted.
.
[**2131-3-24**] TTE: The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular
wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There is moderate
regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
inferior/inferolateral akinesis and hypokinesis of the inferior
septum. Doppler parameters are indeterminate for left
ventricular diastolic function. The right ventricular cavity is
mildly dilated with moderate global free wall hypokinesis. The
ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
are mil
