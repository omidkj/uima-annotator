Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 30**]
Chief Complaint:
Melena

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Push enteroscopy with electrocautery of gastric angioectasia


History of Present Illness:
(history mostly obtained from patient's PCP) 79 yo M with
dilated non-ischemic cardiomyopathy (EF 20%), mechanical AVR,
cirrhosis thought to be secondary to right heart failure, h/o
recurrent GIB mostly secondary to angioectasias of the
stomach/UGI tract, who presents with persistent anemia and
melena. The pt was initially admitted on [**2-1**] at [**Hospital1 18**] for CHF
exacerbation and PNA. During that admission his hematocrit
dropped to 26 from 31, so he received 2 units of PRBC. After
discharge, he was diagnosed with recurrent PNA and was admitted
to [**Hospital3 2568**] in [**3-4**]. The pt was subsequently placed on
antibiotics, resulting in an elevation in INR to approx 10 and
GI bleeding requiring transfusions. His coumadin was stopped due
to his GIB, in light of his chronic afib and AVR. He was
discharged home from [**Hospital3 **] with a hct of 31, but subequent
hct one week later was 24. Again, he was admitted to [**Hospital3 **]
from [**Date range (1) 1919**] in the ICU receiving PRBC transfusions, and was
discharged home with a hct of 31. Again, 1 week later (today)
his hct is 26. At his PCP's office his VS were: 90/60 (may be
baseline), HR 64, some basilar rales. Of note, his baseline wt
is 165 lbs, and at his PCPs office it was up to 172 lbs. His
lasix had been increased for several days from 40 mg [**Hospital1 **] to 60
mg [**Hospital1 **], with his weight decreaseing to 165 lbs, but it is now
back to 172 lbs. Apparently pt had black stool 2 days ago, but
it is now brown.
.
In the ED: pt vitals were Tm 97.2 HR 74 BP 94/49 HR 16-18 Sat
99-100%. NGL negative. Guaiac positive. His hct was 26.

Studies:
[**2195-5-2**] ECG: Atrial fibrillation with a slow ventricular response
and occasional ventricular premature beats. Delayed R wave
transition. Low limb lead voltage. Non-specific ST-T wave
abnormalities. Compared to the previous tracing of [**2195-2-22**] the
ventricular ectopic activity is new. Otherwise, no change.
.
[**2195-5-2**] CXR: Cardiomegaly with prior cardiac surgery.  Small
right pleural effusion.  No consolidation.

Brief Hospital Course:
79 yo M with dilated non-ischemic cardiomyopathy (EF 20%),
mechanical AVR, cirrhosis thought to be secondary to right heart
failure, h/o recurrent GIB mostly secondary to angioectasias of
the stomach/UGI tract, who presents with persistent anemia and
melena. The following issues were investigated during this
hospitalization:
.
# GI bleed: Likely secondary to known angioectasias of the upper
GI tract. Pt. was started on PPI [**Hospital1 **] and transfused 2 units of
PRBCs. GI was consulted and performed push enteroscopy on [**5-5**]
with cauterization of a gastric angioectasia. No other source of
bleeding was identified and the GI team was able to visualize to
the proximal jejunum. Colonoscopy was not performed as he has
had a reported negative study one year prior, but can be
readdressed as an outpatient pending review of his OSH report if
able to be obtained. His hematocrit remained stable after
transfusion and he was likewise hemodynamically stable. He was
restarted on a heparin gtt and coumadinized to therapeutic
(2.5-3.0 goal) prior to discharge.
.
#Anemia: Likely secondary to slow GIB as well as chronic renal
insuffiency. Patient's hematocrit stabilized as mentioned above,
s/p transfusion. He was maintained on iron supplements.
.
# Dilated Cardiomyopathy: Known EF of 20-25% and currently is
chornically volume overloaded with ascites and LE edema
(right-sided failure). His SaO2 remained in the high 90's on
room air at rest and with ambulation. The patient was continued
on his outpatient regimen of 40mg lasix po BID for most of the
hospitalization, however was decreased the day prior to
discharge to 20mg po BID given a slight rise in serum
creatinine. Per prior cardiology notes, toprol XL was held given
tachy/brady syndrome and lisinopril was held given renal
insufficiency and hypotension. However, given significant NSVT
(see below) EP was consulted and toprol XL 25mg was restarted
which he tolerated well without bradycardia.
.
# Chronic Afib: Per cardiology, pt needs to be anticoagulated
given high stroke risk. Coumadin and heparin gtt were given as
per above. Continued digoxin.
.
# AVR: Pt at high risk for stroke off anticoagulation given AVR,
dilated CM, and afib. Coumadin and heparin gtt were given as per
above.
.
# CRI: Cr ranged 2.0-2.4, with BL of 2.6-3. Medications were
renally dosed.
.
# Ventricular ectopy: Pt has frequent PVCs and NSVT (up to 40
beats) on tele. This has been documented in prior d/c summaries.
ICD discussed extensively with patient, family, and EP service
during prior admissions and as an outpatient. This was
re-addressed during this admission with the patient and EP was
reconsulted. Given significant comorbidities and high risk of
peri-procedure mortality, the EP service stated that an ICD is
contraindicated. After detailed discussion, the patient stated
his wish to remain FULL CODE and desires to pursue ICD
placement. Toprol XL restarted per above. K+ and Mg+ were
continually repleted to above 4.0 and 2.0, respectively.
