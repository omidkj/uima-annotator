Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3913**]
Chief Complaint:
40 yo with cml s/p transplant complicated by GVHD presents with
worsening sob.


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
s/p pericardial effusion drainage


History of Present Illness:
Pt is a 40 yo male with a h/o CML s/p MUD (CMV+/+) BMT in [**2147**],
complicated by chronic graft versus host disease of the skin,
lung and liver, in addition to chronic thrombocytopenia. He is
currenlty on Prednisone tx for his severe GVHD of the skin. He
has chronic pulmonary problems with opacities in RML suggestive
of BOOP and is followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 9504**]. He has been on high
doses of steroids and other therapies for his pulmonary
condition. Pt was seen in clinic on [**2152-3-29**] for worsening sob
and flu like symptoms. Nasal fluid sample confirmed influenza
and he was started on tamiflu. Also of note he was diagnosed
with right subclavian dvt recently and was started on lovenox
which he self d/c'ed 10 days ago because it was causing him
pain. Pt now presents with worsening sob and particularly on
exertion. No chest pain/orthopnea/pnd associated. He does have
cough on lying flat but is afebrile and has no sputum or
haemoptysis. He was evaluated in ER where he was noted to have a
mod-severe size pericardial effusion on non contrast CT. Pt was
given a full dose lovenox for dvt/pe and admitted for further
evaluation.


Past Medical History:
#. MUD allo BMT [**10-8**] for CML, c/b GVHD, chronic
thrombocytopenia, anemia,
Donor Info: donor #[**Numeric Identifier 37214**]
Sex: female,
Age: 37,
# of pregnancies: 4,
ABO donor: Apos,
ABO recipient: Apos,
CMV donor: (+),
CMV recipient:(+)
#. GVHD--symptoms have included severe skin findings,
thrombocytopenia requiring transfusions, bronchiolitis
obliterans and mouth sores. treatment options are limited, since
the patient has also had HUS to calcineurin inhibitors such as
cyclosporine, FK 506, no response to rapamycin, has had multiple
trials of Rituxan as well as trial of endostatin all without
signficant improvement.
#. BOOP due to GVHD. He unfortunately has had multiple prior
therapies including Rituxan, pentostatin, Campath, steroids, and
CellCept. He has had a significant issue as in the past with
cyclosporin and FK-506. The patient had a repeat chest CT in
[**2150-12-8**] to reassess his lung disease. There were no
significant changes in the few opacities that may represent
underlying BOOP since his last scan several months ago.
#. RSV pneumonitis
#. HTN
#. CRI
#. portacath in place
#. chronic right extremity edema
#. episodic spasm of mouth muscles, unclear etiology.
#. Obstructive airways disease, possibly due to GVDH.

Non-contributory

Physical Exam:
BP 100/60, pulsus of 20, hr 110, sats 93% on 3l, 98
GENERAL: pleasant, well-appearing man in no acute distress.
HEENT: PERRL with anicteric sclerae. Conjunctivae remains dry
and with some injection Oropharynx remains moist with some
erythematous changes on the buccal mucosae.
NECK: Supple with thickening, no JVD visualised.
LUNGS: bilateral scattered rhonchi but good air entry and no
crackles at bases.
HEART: regular rate and rhythm. distant heart sound, no m/r/g.
ABDOMEN: Soft, nontender, and nondistended with normal bowel
sounds and without hepatosplenomegaly appreciated.
EXTREMITIES: Edema of the right upper extremity, chronic per pt.
He has increased thickening in his lower extremities and mild
edema overall.
SKIN: hyperpigmentation on his scalp and face with skin
thickening and lichen planus changes, this remains relatively
stable. Scabbed lesions noted on scalp and face. Thickening of
the skin of his neck, upper chest, back, and arms with
hyperpigmentation changes and discoloration his arms, back, and
upper chest.


Pertinent Results:
CT [**2152-4-2**]:
1.  Interval increase in simple pericardial effusion, now
moderate to severe in size.  Findings may be cause of patient's
new onset dyspnea on exertion.
2.  Resolution of previously noted right-sided pleural effusion
with residual small left-sided pleural effusion and no
interstitial disease or parenchymal opacity suggestive of
underlying pneumonia identified.  Grossly stable appearance to
right apical nodular opacity likely related to nodular scarring.

.
[**4-2**] CXR, PA/Lat:
1.  Prominent cardiac silhouette, more so than on [**2151-7-23**],
though similar to [**2152-3-29**].  While this could represent an image
obtained in diastole, the
differential diagnosis would include a pericardial effusion.
Clinical
correlation is requested.
2. Stable small left effusion.  Subsegmental atelectasis.  No
acute
infiltrate. No CHF.
.
[**4-3**] Echo: Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF>55%). Right ventricular systolic function is normal. There
is a moderate to large sized pericardial effusion. Greatest
dimension is posterior at 2.0 cm. Less anterior fluid (0.5 -1.0
cm). There is right ventricular early diastolic invagination,
consistent with impaired filling/early tamponade physiology.
.
[**2152-4-5**] Chest CT:
1. New focal right lower lobe consolidation and small right
pleural effusion. This may be due to an acute infectious
pneumonia with parapneumonic effusion given clinical suspicion
for infection.
2. Peripheral and peribronchiolar opacities in the left lower
lobe and
inferior right middle lobe and lingula.  Although nonspecific,
these could be due to COP given the clinical history of this
entity.
3. Persistent small left pleural effusion.
4. Moderate pericardial effusion, decreased in size since recent
CT.
.
[**2152-4-10**] CT Chest: Large left lower lobe consolidation is new.
While consolidation in the anterior basal segment of the right
lower lobe has improved, there are new multiple peribronchial
and subpleural ill-defined opacities in the upper lobe lingula
and right middle lobe. There are no bone findings of malignancy.
The upper abdomen is unremarkable.
IMPRESSION:  Worsening of either COPD or pneumonia. Decrease in
small pericardial effusion.  Enlarging small left pleural
effusion. Coronary calcification. In the right upper lobe,
tubular ill-defined opacity is stable (3A, 18).
.
[**2152-4-13**] CTA:
1. No pulmonary emboli in the central vessels, to the level of
the
subsegmental arteries.
2. Progression of the multifocal consolidations since the prior
study, now
involving both lower lobes, the right middle lobe and the
lingula and, to a lesser extent, the right upper lobe.
3. Moderately large bilateral pleural effusions.
4. Stable small pericardial effusion.
5. Stable right-sided pleural calcifications.
.
[**2152-4-22**] CT Chest:
1. No significant short interval change in the appearance of the
chest, with bilateral lower lobe consolidations, to a similar
degree.  Opacities of the right middle lobe and lingula as well
as the portion of the right upper lobe appear similar, with
possible slight increase in nodular opacities in the lingula.
2. Moderate right pleural effusion and small left pleural
effusion are
slightly decreased from the prior study.
3. Small unchanged pericardial effusion.
4. Coronary artery calcifications.
5. Right pleural calcifications.
.
[**2152-4-25**] Echo: EF >55%, Preserved global biventricular systolic
function. Mildly dilated ascending aorta. Compared with the
prior study (images reviewed) of [**2151-4-14**], no pericardial effusion
is identified on the current study. The pleural effusions appear
more prominent.
.
[**2152-4-26**] CXR: Decrease in size of bilateral effusions.  Possible
new right
upper lobe infiltrate.
.
