Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2736**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest Pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac catheterization with bare metal stent placement to the
right coronary artery.


History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with a PMH significant for
hypertension, dyslipidemia, ischemic cardiomyopathy and coronary
artery disease (status-post BMS to RCA in [**2173**]) who presented to
[**Hospital3 **] after a sudden onset of chest "discomfort" with
associated diaphoresis. EMS was called after the patient had
chest pain and was found to be ashen. EKG showed STE in III>II
and aVF. He was initially taken to [**Hospital3 **] where he
recieved ASA 325mg, and was then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for
further management. In the ED here at [**Hospital1 18**]  he was given a
Plavix load of 600mg and taken emergently to the cardiac
catheterization lab. Cardiac catheterization revealed total
occlusion of the RCA at the site of his prior stent, into which
a new BMS was placed. There was also evidence of diffuse left
main and LAD disease. Right sided filling pressures were also
noted to be elevated. During the procedure the patient had an
episode of VF and his implanted ICD fired and converted him to
back sinus rhythm.
.
Of note the patient had also been experiencing melena for the
past few weeks. His PCP had taken him off of daily ASA for this
in mid-[**2185-8-29**]. He was admitted to [**Hospital3 **] on
[**10-5**] for a recent admission after having melena with some
concurrent "demand ischemia" as his troponins were noted to be
elevated.

[**2185-10-9**] CARDIAC CATHETERIZATION RESULTS/REPORT: Coronary
angiography of this right dominant system demonstrated two
vessel coronary artery disease. The LMCA had a 60% stenosis at
the origin. The LAD was diffusely diseased, with a long 70%
lesion in the mid-vessel, followed by serial 90% stenoses. The
LCx was a small, nondominant vessel without significant
stenoses. The RCA was a superdominant, large vessel which was
occluded proximally in the prior stent with a large thrombus.
Resting hemodynamics revealed moderately elevated right and left
sided filling pressures (RVEDP 15 mm Hg, PCWP mean 25 mm Hg,
respectively). Moderate pulmonary hypertension (PASP 54 mm Hg).
CI =3.0 l/min/m2. The SVR was normal (864 dynes-sec/cm5). The
pulmonary vascular resistance was mildly elevated (140
dynes-sec/cm5). The systemic aortic pressure was initially low
(SBP 79 mm Hg) prior to restoration of blood flow in the RCA,
but normalized to 138 mm Hg after the blood flow resumed. During
left coronary artery injection, the patient had a brief episode
of ventricular tachycardia, degenerating to ventricular
fibrillation, lasting <10 seconds. The rhythm was terminated
with successful defibrillation by the patient's ICD. A temporary
pacing wire was placed in the RV for bradycardia, but did not
need to be used after improved hemodynamics following
reperfusion. Successful manual thrombectomy, PTCA, and placement
of a 3.0x23mm Vision stent postdilated proximally to 4.0mm were
performed.  Final angiography showed normal flow, no apparent
dissection, and no residual stenosis.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Acute inferior ST elevation myocardial infarction.
2. Two vessel coronary artery disease with left main artery
disease.
3. Moderate right and left ventricular diastolic dysfunction.
4. Placement of a bare-metal stent in the proximal RCA.
