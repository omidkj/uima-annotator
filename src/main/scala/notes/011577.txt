.
[**3-7**] colonoscopy:
Impression: In the rectum near the sigmoid there were 4 chains
of medium sized rectal varices with no stigmata of recent
bleeding.
Stool and looping precluded a thorough exam of the cecum.
Otherwise normal colonoscopy to cecum but cecum not well seen
Recommendations: Bleeding source likely rectal varices versus
small hemhorroids. would observe patient and consider local
injection or TIPS if rebleeding.
.
[**3-4**] ECG:
Sinus rhythm. Non-diagnostic Q waves in the inferior leads.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2130-4-23**] premature
ventricular contractions are no longer present.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 55F with autoimmune hepatitis who presents with
BRBPR.
.
* Rectal bleeding
Patient remained hemodynamically stable without any further
episodes of bleeding in hospital. She was started on an
octreotide drip for concern for variceal etiology given recent
intervention though suspicion for this was clinically low; this
was discontinued upon transfer from ICU to floor. She did not
require any blood products. She underwent a colonoscopy (one day
late, due to inadequate prep as she ate a solid food meal when
should have just been clears the day before colonoscopy); which
showed rectal varices but without evidence of a recent bleed,
felt that: bleeding source likely rectal varices versus small
hemorrhoids. She received ciprofloxacin for prophylaxis in
setting of bleed, not discharged with this medication as without
evidence of variceal bleed. Patient did not have any further
bleeding in the ICU or on the floor; her hematocrit was stable.
Her abdominal exam was unremarkable. She was tolerating PO,
ambulating. Started nadolol on discharge to protect against GI
bleed given rectal varices present.
.
* Autoimmune hepatitis and cirrhosis
MELD on admission was 11. LFTs are at recent baseline. Her lasix
and lactulose were held initially, restarted on discharge. She
continued her home prednisone and azathioprine.
.
* h/o DVT and PE: Not on warfarin any longer as outpt. Has
filter placed at OSH. Not active issue.
.
* Thrombocytopenia: Platelets near recent baseline, likely [**12-26**]
cirrhosis.
.
* Depression: not active issue, continued home regimen.
.
