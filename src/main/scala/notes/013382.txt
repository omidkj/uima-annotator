History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 25-year-old
gentleman who suffered a motor vehicle accident and required
intubation. Subsequent to this, he has had dyspnea on
exertion and stridor. Flexible bronchoscopy noted that his
subglottic airway was narrowed to 5 mm. This required
dilatation. Subsequent bronchoscopy revealed the length of
the stenosis to be approximately 3 cm and quite proximal,
involving the circumferential cricoid.

Brief Hospital Course:
pt was admitted and flexible bronchoscopy revealed tracheal
stenosis which was dilated via rigid bronchoscopy. Pt then
developed stridor within 24hrs which was not responsive to
conservative treatment. Pt was transferred to the ICU for heliox
therapy and repeated flexible and rigid bronchoscopies for
dilation while awaiting definitive surgical treatment.
On [**2179-3-15**] pt was taken to the OR for cricotracheal resection. Or
course was uncomplicated. A guardian stitch was placed to
maintained neck flexion. Pt was transferred to the ICU for
pulmonary monitoring. He was maintained on broad spectrun
prophylactic antibiotics until POD#3. Pt was transferred to the
floor on POD# ----. He was [**Last Name (un) 1815**] a soft solids diet and pain was
well controlled w/ po percocet and ambulating indep. On POD# and
a flexible bronch was performed to eval the anastomosis. The
anastomotic site was then visualized. It appeared to be well
healing with a single area of yellowish granulation tissue at
approximately the 5 o'clock area. The airways to the distal
anastomosis were normal in appearance including the trachea,
right and left mainstem. There were some scant, thin, watery
secretions which were suctioned.
The guardian stitch was then cut. The patient was d/c'd to home
and will follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in 2 weeks.
