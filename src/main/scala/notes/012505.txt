Echo [**7-24**]
.
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are
normal (LVEF >55%). Right ventricle is dilated and free wall
motion is normal. There is abnormal diastolic septal
motion/position consistent with right ventricular volume
overload. The aortic arch is mildly dilated. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There
is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is mild
pulmonic valve stenosis. Significant pulmonic regurgitation is
seen.

IMPRESSION: Preserved global biventricular function with
evidence of RV volume overload. Mild pulmonic valve stenosis
with significant pulmonary regurgitation. Mild mitral
regurgitation.


Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 45 y.o male with hx significant for congenital heart
disease who presents with SOB, fevers and CXR findings
consistent with a severe bilateral community acquired pneumonia.
.
# CAP - The patient arrived from [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] after having
received Vanc/Levo/Zosyn.  Legionella antigen and Flu A/B was
negative.  Rapid viral screen negative.  He was continued on
Vanc and Levo in the MICU, and then transferred to the floor
after one night there.  In the unit, he was found to have some
evidence of right ventriclar overload after fluid
administration, and was given lasix, which improved his symptom
of shortness of breath.  He continued to improve on the floor,
and his oxygen requirement was slowly weaned to room air.  He
was discharged with 6 remaining days of a 10 day course of
levofloxacin.  Given CXR and symptomatology, likely an atypical
CAP, possibly mycoplasma pneumonia.  No blood cultures or sputum
cultures grew anything.
.
# Anemia - He was found to be anemic on admission, and was
worked up with iron studies and reticulocyte counts.  He was
found to have a very low iron.  Further history indicated that
this was worked up as outpatient, and he had previously been
diagnosed with Fe deficiency but was not taking iron.  He was
discharged on iron sulfate.
.
# Diarrhea - The patient indicated that he had been having
diarrhea just prior to his being stricken by pneumonia.
Legionella antigen was negative, as was his c-diff from [**Location (un) 620**].
 This improved over the course of his stay.  Stool Ova and
parasites was negative.

# ARF - The patient arrived in acute renal failure.  This
resolved with fluid administration.
