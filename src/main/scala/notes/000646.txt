Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
68 yo M no known medical history presents with 2 day history of
shortness of breath and fatigue. He did state that he had
pneumonia in [**Month (only) **] and required hospitalization. He also was
diagnosed with diabetes after hospital discharge but has not
been taking any oral hypoglycemic agents. He does not like to go
to the doctor [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 15797**] any prior medical history.
In the ER, initial vital signs were at 03:02 0 were 38 (? if
documented incorrectly as triggered for tachycardia) 141/75 16
100% RA.
Patient was triggered for HR 138 consistent with atrial
fibrillation with RVR (no known history of atrial fibrillation).
He was given 300 cc NS with improvement of HR to 100s. CXR
showed RLL infiltrate/effusion. It was thought that he might
have pneumonia, so he was given ceftriaxone and azithromycin.
Labs were performed. WBC was initially 10 with rise to 18.2,
normal Hgb 15.3, platelet 240. Initial INR was 1.7 with rise to
2.
Patient was going to be admitted for pneumonia, new atrial
fibrillation, and renal failure.
Patient then went into atrial fibrillation with RVR to 150s with
resultant hypotension. He was given 2 L NS. Patient was then
became tachyneic to 35, SBP 82. Repeat BP 108/93. He was then
started on an esmolol infusion.  Patient was then intubated as
patient was becoming lethargic/less reponsive with push dose
phenylephrine, etomidate, rocuronium given that he looked like
he was deteroriating. He then had bradycardia to 40s and went
into PEA arrest. CPR was performed for about 2 minutes per
reports with epinephrine 1 mg IV x 1 given.  A non-sterile
femoral line was placed.
He was then started on phenylephrine, levophed with resultant
hypertension to SBP 220s. He was in RVR again to 150s at which
time DCCV was performed with resultant NSR. Cursory ECHO showed
global hypokinesis with poor squeeze. He then coded again with
weaning of pressors with resultant hypotension and PEA arrest.
He was given epinephrine x1, and CPR was performed for about [**1-19**]
minutes with ROSC. GCS was 3 off sedation after the second code.
His baseline in department was AAOx3. Cooling was not performed
in ER but he was placed on ice and sent to the MICU.
On arrival in the CCU,VS were T 97.4 166/33 HR 97 RR 22 on PRVC
500x22, PEEP 18, FiO2 50. ECHO is being performed. Artic sun
protocol was initiated. Post-arrest was consulted. He was given
cefepime and vancomycin for ? pneumonia. He was weaned off
levophed. He was started on a heparin infusion. ECHO was
performed showing EF ~ 25 % with global hypokinesis.

[**2105-4-11**] ECHO
The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. Mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
There is severe global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 25
%). Systolic function of apical segments is relatively
preserved. The estimated cardiac index is depressed
(<2.0L/min/m2). A left ventricular mass/thrombus cannot be
excluded due to suboptimal apical images, but none is seen. The
right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with moderate global
free wall hypokinesis. The aortic root is mildly dilated at the
sinus level. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The
descending thoracic aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion and no aortic stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. There
is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Significant pulmonic regurgitation is seen. There is no
pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with severe global systolic dysfunction
suggestive of a non-ischemic biventricular cardiomyopathy.
Dilated thoracic aorta. Mild mitral regurgitation. Pulmonary
artery hypertension.


Brief Hospital Course:
68 yo M with DM who presented to the ED with dyspnea and was
found to have atrial fibrillation in RVR. He had a PEA arrest
twice in the ED, and was then admitted to the CCU under
post-arrest cooling protocol.

# PEA cardiac arrest
Patient presented with shortness of breath with moderate right
pleural effusion seen on CXR. He likely has some baseline aspect
of heart failure although he is not seen on regular basis by a
doctor. He had new atrial fibrillation with RVR that likely led
to flash pulmonary edema. He eventually required intubation with
subsequent PEA arrest in setting of transient
hypotension/hypoxia. Circulation was returned but then PEA
arrest occurred again. He was packed with ice and admitted to
the CCU. On arrival in the CCU he was started on the Arctic sun
cooling protocol, then actively rewarmed over the course of the
next 24 hours. There was no evidence of STEMI on ECG or cardiac
enzymes. An echo showed global systolic dysfunction with LVEF of
25%, which is possibly acute stunning vs chronic heart failure.
Post-arrest consult service was notified. He required ongoing
pressor support with norepinephrine and phenylephrine. Pressors
were eventually weaned and he remained normotensive.

On further discussions with patient's family, it was noted that
he is a devout [**Doctor First Name **] Scientist. He has rarely seen doctors
in the past, and was not taking any medications for diabetes or
heart disease. His daughters stated that given his prior
reluctance to obtain medical care, he would not want to be
intubated or in the ICU. They felt that any aggressive measures
would be against his wishes. On [**4-15**], the decision was made to
withdraw care and pursue comfort measures only. His ventilator,
medications and vitals were all stopped. He was transferred to
the floor and expired on the morning of [**4-17**].

# Hypoxemic respiratory failure
His respiratory failure was felt to be related to flash
pulmonary edema from afib with RVR. He was intubated in the ED.
Serial ABGs were monitored with adjustment of vent settings.
Prior to withdrawal of care, he had been on pressure support.
After the goals of care discussion, the ventilator was stopped
and he was extubated.

# Atrial fibrillation s/p DCCV
Patient was noted to be in new atrial fibrillation with RVR on
arrival to ER. ECG without significant underlying conduction
disease. [**Month (only) 116**] have had atrial fibrillation in setting of chronic
heart failure exacerbation. No evidence of PE or other
precipitants. He was cardioverted on [**2105-4-11**].

# Neuroprotection s/p arrest: Patient had GCS of 3 after return
of circulation post-arrest. He was immediately cooled and Artic
Sun protocol was initiated on arrival to CCU. Protocol included
MAPs>65, head of bed 30 degrees, core temp 33 degrees for 24
hours, sedation with fent/midaz, paralyz
