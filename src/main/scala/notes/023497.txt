Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 86608**] is a [**Age over 90 **]M with a history of CAD, CHF (LVEF 20%),
atrial fibrillation, moderate atrial stenosis, chronic renal
insufficiency (creatinine 1.4 at baseline) transferred from
[**Hospital1 112**]/[**Hospital1 882**] on [**2175-6-3**] for further management of systolic heart
failure, pulmonary edema, and atrial fibrillation
.
The patient was admitted to [**Hospital 882**] Hospital in early [**Month (only) 116**] for
respiratory distress with flash pulmonary edema requiring
intubation, atrial fibrillation with RVR, and hypotension
requiring vasopressors. He was eventually discharged to rehab
where he spent two days and then re-presented to [**Hospital 882**]
Hospital on [**2175-5-27**] with BRBPR on tissue after wiping, low grade
fever, and leukocytosis.  He was found to be C. difficile
positive and was started on PO Flagyl with PO vancomycin added
on [**2175-6-1**]. He had a tenuous hemodynamic status during the
course of his hospitalization with episodes of flash pulmonary
edema requiring BiBAP (occurring both in setting of AF w/ RVR as
well as when rate controlled)with good resopnse to small IV
lasix boluses and on maintenance lasix 20po [**Hospital1 **]. He had several
episodes of asymptomatic hypotension with systolics in the
70s-80s for which he was given small fluid boluses. For the
atrial fibrillation he was continued on his home regimen of
coreg and amiodarone (recently started on [**5-18**]) with two
episodes of RVR that responded to diltiazem 10mg IV. Coumadin
was held in setting of supratherapeutic INR of 4.3.  Per OSH D/C
summary, there was concern that cardiac ischemia was
contributing to decompensated heart failure so he was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for stress testing and possible cath.
.
He was transferred on [**2175-6-3**] to [**Hospital1 18**].  He had an episode of
hypotension earlier in the day so given IVF, carvedilol dose
reduced, lasix held. Then around 21:00 atrial fibrillation with
RVR. Then at 23:00 triggered for tachypnic to 40s, answering
questions but retractions on exam, evidence of pulmonary edema
on CXR. ABG at time of transfer: 7.32/39/89. Given lasix 20IV
x2, transferred to CCU.
.
On the floor, patient does not report chest pain. Per son, the
patient told friend that has not been feeling well for past 6
months with fatigue, shortness of breath.

Portable TTE (Complete) Done [**2175-6-3**] at 1:06:08 PM
The left atrium is moderately dilated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity is mildly
dilated. There is severe regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction with inferior akinesis and severe hypokinesis of the
remaining segments (LVEF = 20 %). Right ventricular chamber size
is normal. with mild global free wall hypokinesis. The diameters
of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is
moderate aortic valve stenosis. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation
is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There
is no mitral valve prolapse. The mitral valve leaflets do not
fully coapt. Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is severe
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. Significant pulmonic
regurgitation is seen. There is a trivial/physiologic
pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Inferior wall akinesis with remaining wall severe
hypokinesis and overall severely depressed left ventricular
systolic function. Moderate aortic stenosis. Moderate to severe
mitral regurgitation. Severe pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension.

CHEST (PA & LAT) Study Date of [**2175-6-3**] 11:26 AM
Two views of the chest demonstrate bilateral pleural effusion
with fluid
tracking along the major fissure. There is bilateral lower lobe
consolidation. The upper lung zones are relatively clear. The
heart and
mediastinum are within normal limits.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2175-6-3**] 11:01 PM
Comparison is made to the prior study of the same day from 11:37
hours. There is cardiomegaly. The aortic arch is mildly
calcified. There is mild
congestive failure with mild bibasilar atelectasis and left
lower lobe
consolidation. There are small bilateral pleural effusions.
These findings
have not changed considerably since prior study.


Brief Hospital Course:
[**Age over 90 **]M with a history of CAD, systolic heart failure(LVEF 20%),
atrial fibrillation, moderate atrial stenosis, chronic renal
insufficiency (creatinine 1.4 at baseline) transferred to CCU
for respiratory distress with evidence of acute pulmonary edema.

.
# RESPIRATORY DISTRESS: Most likely acute pulmonary edema in the
setting of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate in a
patient with severe systolic heart failure and tenuous fluid
status. CXR not consistent with pneumonia. Pulmonary embolism
unlikely given given supratherapeutic INR. Patient was diuresed
with iv lasix and respiratory status improved.  Patient
transitioned to increased dose of PO lasix on discharge.  Weight
on discharge 71.5kg close to dry weight.
.
# HYPOTENSION: The suspicion is highest that intermittent
hypotension is due to reduced cardiac output in settin
