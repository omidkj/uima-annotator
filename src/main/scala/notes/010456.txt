Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 106**]
Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea, orthopnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none


History of Present Illness:
This is a 79 year-old male with a history of CAD s/p CABG ('[**21**]),
IDDM, systolic CHF (EF 15%) s/p ICD, AF on coumadin, who
presented to outside hospital from [**Hospital1 599**] with shortness of
breath x months but worsening over past 5 days, nonproductive
cough, and orthopnea.  He also reports PND over past two to
three weeks.  At baseline he is able to walk from bed to
bathroom however over past week he has not been able to get out
of bed [**3-5**] shortness of breath.  He denied any fevers, chills,
chest pain or palpitations.  He reports that his lasix dose has
been uptitrated over the past week and is now at a dose of 90mg
twice daily.  According to EP noted dated [**3-14**] plan was to
increase Lasix to 40mg [**Hospital1 **] from 20mg [**Hospital1 **] - so likely increased
quickly over past several days.  He has never been so short of
breath before - denies prior admissions for heart failure.
.
In the ED, initial vitals were T: 97.7 HR: 79 BP: 103/71 RR: 18
O2Sat: 100% on 2L.  Exam was notable for lungs with diffuse
rales, 3+ peripheral edema.  Labs were notable for a BNP of
[**Numeric Identifier **] (12K 3 weeks ago), Cr 1.5.  CXR showed mild pulmonary
congestion.  Patient received 40 mg IV lasix and was given
Levofloxacin x 1.  He was initially going to [**Hospital Ward Name 121**] 3 however then
became asymptomatically hypotensive (systolic 70-80s/50s) and
bed changed to CCU.  Not felt to be due to lasix as BP changed
minutes after dose was given.  He put out 900-1000cc urine in
ED.  Given hypotension blood cultures and lactate were sent.  He
was given 250cc bolus x 2 with improvement in BP to systolic
100s.
.
Of note, patient was admitted at the end of [**Month (only) 404**] for gout
flare in ankle treated with oral steroids.  He reports that he
was symptomatic at that time but nothing mentioned in d/c
summary.
.
On arrival to the CCU, the patient has no acute complaints.  He
overall feels unwell, fatigued and short of breath - worse with
lying flat.
.
Review of systems is otherwise negative for fevers, chills,
night sweats.  He denies abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting.
Increased urinary frequency recently but no dysuria.  Appetite
is within normal limits.  Positive for nonproductive cough.

EKG [**2142-3-20**]- Atrial fibrillation, Ventricular pacing. Since
previous tracing of [**2142-2-18**], ventricular premature complexes not
seen, QRS interval wider suggest less A-V conduction
.
Chest x-ray [**2142-3-20**] - IMPRESSION: Stable cardiomegaly and mild
prominence of the central pulmonary vasculature with otherwise
clear lungs.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

.
Echo [**2142-3-21**] - The left atrium is elongated. The right atrium
is markedly dilated. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or
color Doppler. The estimated right atrial pressure is 0-10mmHg.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. There is severe global
left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 25 %). No masses or thrombi
are seen in the left ventricle. There is no ventricular septal
defect. The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with
moderate global free wall hypokinesis. The diameters of aorta at
the sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate [2+]
tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial
effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2138-9-19**], no
major change.


Brief Hospital Course:
78 year old male with ho CHF EF 15%, CAD s/p CABG IVCD implant,
HTN, IDDM presents with acute exacerbation of systolic heart
failure.
.
#. Pump: Known ischemic CMP with worsening symptoms of
orthopnea, PND, LE edema and SOB over past two months presents
with elevated BNP, O2 requirement and pulm congestion on CXR.
Unclear precipitant but per patient history sounds like subacute
decompensation. Patient denies any dietary indiscretion.
Unlikely to be acute ishcemia in the setting of flat troponins
and CKs. In terms of active infectios work-up there was no clear
infiltrate on chest x-ray, UA with trace blood otherwise no
obvious infection. Blood cultures were no growth to date.
Patient responded to IV lasix with good effect. Patient was
diuresed roughly 1-2 liters per day. Repeat echo demonstrated no
acute change from previous echo from [**2138**]. Cough improved with
diuresis.  Patient was discharged on increased dose of lasix to
prevent fluid reaccumulation.  Patient maintained on aspirin,
statin which were continued throughout hospitalization.
Initially held carvedilol in the setting of hypotension, but
restarted at lower dose. Initially held epl
