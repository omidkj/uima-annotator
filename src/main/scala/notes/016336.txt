CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Ms. [**Known lastname 931**], a 53-year-old female
transferred from [**Hospital 1474**] Hospital today when, at
approximately 6 a.m., she awoke with a slight headache.
Fifteen minutes later she had worst headache of her life.
She stated it was like a bomb was going to explode in her
head.  Her left eye became blurry and she had severe pain,
and the blurriness in her eye lasted approximately 3 minutes
and then pain subsided to about a [**5-12**].

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Ms. [**Known lastname 931**] had been in her
usual state of health until approximately 1 month ago when
she developed a headache a few times a week relieved with
aspirin.  Then 2 weeks ago her headaches became more severe
and she was sent for a CAT scan which, per report, showed an
enlarged vein.  She was scheduled to have an MRI on the week
of admission.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  She was positive for headache.  No visual
disturbances at the time.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for chronic bronchitis,
back surgeries in the past.

Medications on admission were Advair and Albuterol.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  She was not working.  She is divorced, has a
boyfriend and 4 children.

Head CT on admission showed subarachnoid hemorrhage
throughout her basal cisterns and her left sylvian fissure
and along the cerebral sulci she had 1 cm of attenuation on
the left side of the prepontine cistern.  Her white count on
admission was 10.2, hematocrit 48.2, and 301 for her
platelets.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  She was awake, alert, laughing, in no
distress.  HEENT:  Pupils were 2.5 bilaterally, trace
reactive.  EOMs were full.  Mouth had no lesions.  Neck was
supple.  Chest:  Occasional expiratory wheezes; no crackles.
Regular rate and rhythm.  Abdomen was soft, nontender; bowel
sounds were positive.  Extremities showed no edema.  Neuro
exam:  She was awake, alert, oriented times 3; followed 2-
step commands.  She had no drift, a symmetric smile.  Visual
fields were intact.  Her motor strength was [**4-6**] in both upper
and lower extremities.  Her speech was intact.  Her sensory
was intact to light touch.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  She was admitted to the Neurosurgery
service to Dr.[**Name (NI) 9224**] service and was brought emergently to
the Diagnostic Cerebral Endovascular Suite, where she
underwent a diagnostic cerebral angiogram which showed a P-
comm aneurysm which was coiled on [**2140-12-17**].  She had a
ventriculostomy drain placed intraoperatively.  Post
procedure she was awake, alert, and oriented times 3, moving
all extremities.  Her memory was intact.  She had a negative
drift and a symmetric smile.  Her motor exam was [**4-6**] in both
upper and lower extremities.  Her blood pressure was kept
less than 140.  She had a sheath line in place which remained
in place for 24 hours.  She was also started on Dilantin and
Namodipine for seizure and vasospasm prophylaxis.  She was
monitored in the ICU with q. 1-hour neuro checks.

On [**2140-12-19**] she had a central line placed in order to
monitor a CVP in preparation for prophylaxis against
vasospasm.

On [**2140-12-21**] she remained neurologically intact.  Her
sodiums were noted to drop from 137 to 134.  She was started
on sodium tablets.  She head also spiked a fever to 101.9,
and there was no source of infection found.  It was felt to
be related to bed rest and pulmonary status.  She is a heavy-
use smoker.  She was also started on some Decadron to assist
with her headaches.

On [**12-22**] she was on subarachnoid day 6, which was felt
she was entering a period of increased vasospasm.  Her mental
status remained intact.  However, she was sometimes agitated
and confused though was easily redirectable.  Her CVP
remained low, and so her IV sugars were increased to 150 cc
an hour.  Her systolic range blood pressure was increased
from 140 closer to 140 to 170, wanting to keep it closer to
170 and keep her fluid level high to avoid hypotension.  She
continued to have her sodiums checked q. 6h.

On [**12-23**] she underwent a diagnostic cerebral angiogram
which showed stable coil appearance of her P-comm aneurysm ad
no vasospasm noted.  She continued to spike the fevers as of
the [**12-24**], and her Dilantin was switched to Keppra
in thoughts that it could possibly be a drug fever.

[**12-22**] through [**12-26**] she was noted to have
periods of agitation and restlessness.  She was placed on
Haldol and Fentanyl, which seemed to improve her situation
and she was given a sitter for safety measures.

On [**12-28**] she had her ventriculostomy drain switched to a
lumbar drain at approximately 15 cc an hour.  Her drainage
was decreased to 10 cc on the 27th and to 5 cc an hour on the
28th.  She tolerated a decrease in CSF output well and
remained neurologically intact and awake, alert.

On [**1-1**] she was transferred to the Neuro step-down
unit.  At that point she had been awake, alert, oriented
times 3.  She had no neuro deficits noted other than
occasional agitation at times.  Her vital signs remained
within the normal range anywhere from 140 to 170s.  She
continues on aggressive IV therapy, though they were
decreased down to 100 cc on her transfer and continued on
Namodipine.  She was seen by Physical Therapy and
Occupational Therapy while in the Neuro step-down unit, who
felt she ambulated well and was safe to be discharged as long
as she had 24-hour care at home.  Her daughter did agree to
take her home with 24-hour care.  Her lumbar drain was
discontinued on [**1-3**], and on [**1-4**] she
underwent a lumbar puncture which showed an opening pressure
of 13.  She remained neurologically intact without any neuro
deficits or headaches.  She was transferred to the Surgical
floor, where she was ambulating, eating without difficulty,
and remained neurologically intact.  It was felt that she was
safe to be discharged on [**1-5**].  She was discharged to
home with a home safety check and a nursing check at home.

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:  She should have her suture in her
back from her lumbar drain site discontinued in 1 week, on
[**1-10**].  She should return if she develops any
significant headaches not relieved with pain medication or
any change in neuro status.  She should follow up with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 1132**] in 2 to 3 weeks' time, and she was given a phone number
for that.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  She should go back on her respiratory
medications as prior to admission.  She was given a
prescription for Percocet 5/325 1 to 2 tablets p.o. q. 4-6
hours as needed, Colace that she should take while on
Percocet, a nicotine patch; she should avoid smoking.  She
was discharged neurologically intact.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1. Subarachnoid hemorrhage status post coiling.
2. Chronic bronchitis.
