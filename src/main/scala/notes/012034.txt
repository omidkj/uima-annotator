CXR:
[**2123-3-9**]: The Dobbhoff tube is in the stomach. The left
retrocardiac consolidation is unchanged. The left upper lung
consolidation is also re-demonstrated. Right lung is essentially
clear. Small amount of left pleural effusion is most likely
present. Overall, except for technical differences, no change
since the prior study has been noted.

Chest CT:
[**2123-2-28**]: IMPRESSION:
1. Small left pneumothorax presumed to be postoperative.
2. Small bilateral pleural effusions, larger on the left.
3. Consolidation in the residual segment of the left lower lobe
is likely due to atelectasis; however, underlying infection
cannot be excluded.
4. Moderately extensive bilateral upper lobe ground-glass
opacities could
reflect edema, ARDS or atypical infection.




Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 45207**] was taken to the operating room by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on
[**2123-2-22**] for a VATS left lower lobectomy and mediastinal lymph
node dissection. He was extubated postoperatively but in the
PACU developed copious thick yellow secretions requiring ongoing
suction and spiked to 102.9. He was also hypertensive with some
question of pulmonary edema receiving Lasix, labetalol and
hydralazine. He was transferred to the ICU for further
management of his secretions requiring re-intubation secondary
to sedation on [**2123-2-28**] and successfully extubated on [**2123-3-3**].
Below is a systems review of his hospital course.

Pain/Neuro: The patient was obtunded therefore neurology was
consulted on POD O, and all sedating medications were stopped.
The patient responded but appeared to have benzodiazepine
withdrawal [**2-26**], therefore CIWA scale initiated, and psychiatric
consultation obtained. Clonidine was re initiated at 0.5mg po
tid, and psychiatry followed. Neurology followed the patient
early on and did not feel the need for any head imaging given no
focal neurologic deficit.

Psychiatry followed the patient throughout his hospital course
for current acute delirium, depression nos by history of
anxiety. His home sedating medications were held (Neurontin,
Seroquel, cyclobenzaprine, Prozac, and Ambien) for wash out.
His Klonopin was restarted at 1/2 his home dose 0.5 tid. His
mental status slowly improving with some brief episodes of brief
confusion.

Pulmonary: Aggressive pulmonary toilet with mucolytic nebs and
chest PT continued.  His oxygenation improved to 97% 2L via
nasal cannula.

Chest tube: left was removed. He was followed by serial chest
films which showed left lower lobe atelectasis and small
effusion.

CV: The patient remained hemodynamically stable throughout, in
NSR. He was hypertensive, therefore prn doses of hydralazine and
Lopressor were given in the ICU.

Renal: The patient developed rising creatinine, therefore renal
consultation was obtained, with peak creatinine of 3.8. It was
felt he was hypovolemic which improved with IV fluids
challenges.  On discharge his CRE was 1.6 (base 1.4-1.6).  Once
able to take PO's his home dose Flomax was restarted the Foley
was removed and he voided.

GI: Remained NPO secondary to mental status.  He was seen by
Speech on [**2123-2-26**] for a bedside swallow with s/sx of aspiration
on all trials.  A Dobbhoff was placed and tube feeds started. He
self d/c'd his feeding tube. On follow-up Speech cleared him for
ground solids and nectar thickened liquids and thickened vitamin
shakes tid.

ID: A few hours postoperatively the patient developed Tmax 102.9
and he was pan cultured with empiric vancomycin and Zosyn
started which was discontinued 12 hours later. The patient
continued to spike fevers.  Pan cultured. Positive UA was
started on Cipro continue to spike fevers 102. Urine culture
grew E. coli resistant to Cipro, sensitive to ceftriaxone which
was changed on [**2123-3-2**] x 7 days without further fevers.

Heme: HCT stable 30.  History of pulmonary embolism [**2120**] treated
with Coumadin.  Given his Coumadin course was greater than 1
year and at risk for falls we elected to hold his Coumadin.  He
can follow-up with his PCP as an outpatient for further Coumadin
recommendations.  He was continued on Heparin SQ for DVT
prophylaxis.

Dispo: He was followed by physical therapy, he is a maximum
assist. He was discharged to [**Hospital3 7665**]-[**Hospital1 3597**] NH
[**Telephone/Fax (1) **].  He will follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] as an
outpatient.
