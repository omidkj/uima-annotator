Chief Complaint:
Pneumonia, Alcohol Withdrawal, Alcohol Dependence with Acute
Intoxication

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none


History of Present Illness:
59 year old male with a history of polysubstance abuse and
chronic pain, recently discharged from the medical service for
alcohol withdrawal and pneumonia, who was brought in by EMS
after he was found intoxicated at a T-stop.  In the ED, the
patient sobered from his acute alcohol intoxication.  However,
he then went into withdrawal.  He began [**Doctor Last Name **] 22 on CIWA and
was given 3 doses of ativan.

Of note, the patients last admission one month prior to this
presentation was complicated by pneumonia, for which he was
discharged on amoxicillin/clavulonate.  The patient continues to
note a persistent cough, although denies fever or chills.   He
underwent chest X-ray in the ED was concerning for either a
recurrence of his pneumonia or a persistence of the prior
pneumonia.

CHEST (PA & LAT) Study Date of [**2171-3-14**] 9:29 PM
1. Continued right middle lobe opacification concerning for
pneumonia. As the findings appear similar when compared to prior
study, chest CT should be obtained to evaluate for the presence
of an obstructing central or endobronchial lesion.
2. Improved aeration of the left lower lobe with residual linear
opacities which may be reflective of atelectasis.

CT Chest non-con, [**3-16**]:
1. Right middle lobe collapse with bronchial obstruction. Right
lower lobe bronchus severely narrowed proximally with distal
reconstitution. In the setting of involvement of two adjacent
airways, lesion extrinsic to the airways is more likely than
endobronchial lesions, but evaluation is limited in the absence
of intravenous contrast. Repeat chest CT with intravenous
contrast could be performed for further evaluation.
Alternatively, direct visualization could be performed.
2. Prominent mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes.
3. Subcentimeter nodules and ground-glass opacity in the left
lower lobe, concerning for infection. In the presence of
centrilobular emphysema, close interval follow up is recommended
after treatment or within 3 months.
4. Mild anterior wedging of the T11 and T12 vertebral bodies.
5. Predominantly left-sided coronary artery calcifications.

CXR portable Study Date of [**2171-3-19**] 1:39 AM:
Mild-to-moderate bibasilar atelectasis has been present without
appreciable change since [**2-3**]. Previous small bilateral
pleural effusions have decreased. Upper lungs are clear. Heart
size is normal. There are no findings to suggest pneumonia
currently.

What appears to be a 5-cm long segment of catheter tubing
crosses the paramedian left hemithorax obliquely. In order to
clarify whether there is a retained catheter fragment, routine
chest radiograph should be obtained, and the radiologist
notified before the patient leaves the department.


Brief Hospital Course:
58 year old man with a history of polysubstance abuse, admitted
to the hospital with intoxication/withdrawal symptoms and
hypoxia; admission complicated by hypercarbic respiratory
failure.

# Hypercarbic and Hypoxic Respiratory failure:  On admission,
the patient was noted to be hypoxic. He also has chronic CO2
retention related to baseline COPD.  He underwent CT chest on
admission that showed RML collapse, likely by extrinsic
compression by mass.  He was started on ceftriaxone and
azithromycin for CAP coveraged.  He was evaluated by
interventional pulmonary with plan for bronchoscopy to further
evaluate bronchial obstruction.  However, with the use of
benzodiazepines for alcohol withdrawal (described below), he
became somnolent and began to go into hypercarbic and hypoxic
respiratory failure.  He was transferred to the MICU.  In the
ICU, the patient was reversed with 4 doses of flumazenil.  He
did not require invasive ventilation.  The benzodiazepines
cleared from his system, and he awoke.  He eloped from the
hospital prior to planned bronchoscopy.  The patient should
follow up with interventional pulmonology for further evaluation
of his right middle lobe collapse.

# Alcohol Withdrawal, Alcohol Dependence with Acute
Intoxication: The patient presented to the emergency department
with alcohol intoxication, and was admitted to the hospital
floor as he started to withdraw.  In the first 24 hours of his
hospital stay, he received >100mg valium.  By hospital day 3
symptoms of withdrawal had improved, however, the patient became
increasingly somnolent.  Respiratory drive was decreased by
cumulative effect of benzodiazepines, and the patient was
transferred to the MICU as above.

# Chronic Pain:  Per prior notes and patient report, he takes
methadone 10mg TID for chronic pain after a motor vehicle
accident. On admission, he was continued on methadone 10mg TID.
This medication was held on admission to the ICU, as the patient
experienced increasing somnolence.

# Benign Hypertension: The patient was continued on home
Toprol-XL 25mg daily.

# Lung nodules: CT chest showed "Subcentimeter nodules and
ground-glass opacity in the left lower lobe, concerning for
infection. In the presence of centrilobular emphysema, close
interval follow up is recommended after treatment or within 3
months."  The patient was recommended to follow up regarding
these findin
