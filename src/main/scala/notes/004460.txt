Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2234**]
Chief Complaint:
fevers s/p ERCP

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Elective ERCP: stent removal, spincterotomy & balloon sweep

History of Present Illness:
80 yo male who initially presented to [**Hospital1 18**] for elective ERCP.
Patient had an ERCP done back in [**3-/2143**] which showed a dilated
CBD and intrahepatic bile ducts with multiple filling defects in
the distal CBD, consistent with stones, and a stent was placed
at that time. The patient then underwent a lap cholecystectomy
in [**5-/2143**] without any complications. He returned to [**Hospital1 18**] on the
day of admission for repeat ERCP, stent was removed, a
sphincterotomy was performed, and a balloon sweep was also done.
Following the procedure, the patient spiked a temperature to
101, which then climbed to 103. He was started on Unasyn, labs
and blood cultures were sent.  He was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**]
for closer monitoring.  He defervesced and was transferred to
the floor the following day.

Imaging:
ERCP reportProcedures: 1. The previously placed plastic stent
was removed with a snare.
2. A sphincterotomy was performed in the 12 o'clock position
using a sphincterotome over an existing guidewire
3. The stones were extracted successfully using a 15 mm balloon.


Impression: 1. A previously placed plastic stent was found in
the major papilla and was removed using snare
2. Cannulation of the biliary duct was performed with a
sphincterotome using a free-hand technique
3. Cholangiogram showed dilated CBD to 1.5 cm and multiple
filling defects suggestive of stones
4. A sphincterotomy was performed in the 12 o'clock position
using a sphincterotome over an existing guidewire
5. The stones were extracted successfully using a 15 mm balloon.


Recommendations: 1. Admit for observation
2. NPO tonight and start clears in AM
3. Advance diet if tolerated in AM
4. Ciprofloxacin 500 mg [**Hospital1 **] for 7 -10 days
5. IV fluids and analgesia
6. Follow up with Dr [**First Name (STitle) 2819**] and [**Last Name (un) 5292**]
.
Pathology: stent returned negative for malignant cells.
.
CXR [**6-25**]
One view. Comparison with [**2143-3-24**]. There is blunting of the left
costophrenic sulcus. The lungs appear otherwise clear. The left
hemidiaphragm is mildly elevated, as before. The cardiac
silhouette remains prominent. The aorta is mildly tortuous and
calcified. Mediastinal structures are otherwise unremarkable. A
single surgical clip is projected over the left pulmonary hilum
as before. The bony thorax is grossly intact.

IMPRESSION: Blunting of the left costophrenic sulcus which may
represent pleural thickening or fluid. The lungs appear clear.

CXR [**6-28**] PA and lateral:
Heart is enlarged and central pulmonary vascularity appears
engorged. Previously reported asymmetric hazy opacities in the
right perihilar region have slightly progressed, and there are
new subtle interstitial opacities within the left lung, but
distribution remains asymmetric. There has been previous partial
resection of the left lung with associated volume loss and mild
pleural thickening, unchanged.

IMPRESSION: Worsening asymmetrical opacities involving the right
lung to a much greater degree than the left. Although
potentially related to asymmetrical edema, underlying pneumonia
in the right lung is suspected given the history of persistent
fever.

                            **FINAL REPORT [**2143-7-1**]**

   GRAM STAIN (Final [**2143-6-28**]):
      <10 PMNs and <10 epithelial cells/100X field.
      1+    (<1 per 1000X FIELD):   BUDDING YEAST.
      QUALITY OF SPECIMEN CANNOT BE ASSESSED.

   RESPIRATORY CULTURE (Final [**2143-7-1**]):
      OROPHARYNGEAL FLORA ABSENT.
      Due to mixed bacterial types ( >= 3 colony types) an
abbreviated
      workup will be performed appropriate to the isolates
recovered from
      this site.
      EXTENDED WORKUP REQUESTED BY DR. [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Numeric Identifier 62935**].
      ENTEROBACTER CLOACAE.    SPARSE GROWTH.
         This organism may develop resistance to third
generation
         cephalosporins during prolonged therapy. Therefore,
isolates that
         are initially susceptible may become resistant within
three to
         four days after initiation of therapy.  For serious
infections,
         repeat culture and sensitivity testing may therefore be
warranted
         if third generation cephalosporins were used.
      STAPH AUREUS COAG +.    SPARSE GROWTH.
         Oxacillin RESISTANT Staphylococci MUST be reported as
also
         RESISTANT to other penicillins, cephalosporins,
carbacephems,
         carbapenems, and beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations.

         Rifampin should not be used alone for therapy.
