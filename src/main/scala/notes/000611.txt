HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the Medical
Service.  The patient was a 55 year-old male who was admitted
to the Medical Service for prehydration prior to angio for
claudication.  The patient went for cardiac catheterization
on [**2126-3-1**].  Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] attending and the patient was noted to
have three vessel disease.  For more details please see
procedure note.  Cardiac Surgery was consulted on [**2126-3-2**].
The patient was evaluated by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1537**] and deemed appropriate
for coronary artery bypass surgery.  After undergoing the
appropriate preoperative workup the patient went to the
Operating Room on [**2126-3-6**] for coronary artery bypass graft
times four, left internal mammary coronary artery to left
anterior descending coronary artery, saphenous vein graft to
right coronary artery to the posterior descending coronary
artery, saphenous vein graft to the obtuse marginal.  For
more detailed account please see operative report.  The
patient was transferred to the CSRU on a Dobutamine and Neo
IV.  Chest x-ray postoperatively was notable for a left lower
lobe collapse.  The patient was extubated early on
postoperative day number one.  In addition, on postoperative
day number one the patient required one unit of packed red
blood cells.  Of note on postoperative day number two the
patient had a creatinine of 2.8, which rose from 2.0.  The
Renal Service was consulted and they recommended holding
diuresis with Lasix, transfusing to a hematocrit above 30 and
avoiding other nephrotoxic agents.  In addition they
recommended keeping systolic blood pressure over 130.

On [**2126-3-7**] the patient remained on pressors with
neo-synephrine intravenously.  Insulin drip was also
restarted at this time.  On [**2126-3-10**] the patient was
transfused 2 units of packed red blood cells for a low urine
output.  The patient's renal status was worsening at this
time with creatinine of 2.5 to 3 range.  In addition, on this
day the mediastinal chest tube was discontinued.  The patient
continued to have left persistent left lower collapse.  On
[**2126-3-12**] the patient was transfused 1 unit of packed red blood
cells.  The patient was off pressors.  On [**2126-3-14**] the patient
had a bronchoscopy, which revealed a mild tracheal malacia
otherwise within normal limits.  The patient also at this
time was noted to have a rise in white blood cell count, so
was placed on Levofloxacin.  White blood cell count rose to
24.  On [**2126-3-15**] the patient was found to have an alkaline
phosphatase of greater then 1000.  Right upper quadrant
ultrasound was done, which showed some dilation.  General
Surgery Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] was consulted and the patient was
monitored with expectant management.  The patient was
eventually transferred to the floor on [**2126-3-15**].  The patient
continued to have left lower lobe collapse on chest x-ray.
Creatinine was stable in the 2 to 2.5 range.  White blood
cell count was persistently high between 20 and 25,000.
Liver function tests were steady decreasing and the patient's
abdominal examination was benign.  The patient was also noted
to have some erythema at the superior pole of the sternotomy
wound with minimal drainage, which improved over the course
of his floor stay.

On [**2126-3-18**] Infectious Disease was consulted and they
recommended placing the patient on Vancomycin.  He was placed
on 1 gram q 24 hours.  Over the next several days the
patient's white blood cell count steadily decreased to the
current discharge white blood cell count of 11.  In addition,
the patient was intermittently diuresed.  In addition, the
patient received intermittent doses of Kayexalate for a
potassium level between 5 and 6.  The patient continued to
improve clinically on the Vancomycin. Infectious Disease
recommended discharge with PICC line and intravenous
Vancomycin for three weeks.  On the day of discharge the
patient's white blood cell count was stable at 11.  The
patient's creatinine had decreased to 1.8.  The patient was
replaced on po Lasix, however, on only 40 mg b.i.d. instead
of his usual home dose of 100.  The patient's ace inhibitor
and [**Last Name (un) **] continued to be held to be started at the discretion
of his primary care physician.  [**Name10 (NameIs) **] patient continued to have
left lower lobe collapse, however, pulmonary is recommending
no intervention at this time.  The patient is clinically
stable.
