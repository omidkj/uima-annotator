Service:

Please see addendum to discharge summary for hospital course
starting on [**2153-6-29**] until time of discharge.

The patient is a [**Age over 90 **]-year-old woman with a history of
hypertension, "asthma," and history of thyroid surgery,
admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit on [**6-24**] with
acute congestive heart failure.  The patient developed acute
onset of dyspnea after awakening in the middle of the night
and being unable to catch her breath on [**2153-6-24**].  She had no
associated chest pain or palpitations.  She denies any
baseline dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea,
or lower extremity edema.  She also denies fevers, cough, or
other respiratory symptoms.  The patient called her daughter
and EMS was ultimately called.  The patient had further
respiratory decompensation en route, with several failed
intubation attempts.  The patient was unresponsive on arrival
to the Emergency Department and was intubated without
incident.  Initial blood pressure was elevated at 218/108,
with a heart rate of 111.  A bedside echocardiogram on
admission was notable for an ejection fraction of 45%, with
new inferoposterior wall motion abnormalities.
Electrocardiogram showed an old left bundle branch block.
The patient was diuresed and put on intravenous
nitroglycerin.  She had a mild elevation in her troponin to
0.6, but her CKs were normal.  She was empirically treated
for a question of pneumonia by chest x-ray with levofloxacin.


Following admission to the Medical Intensive Care Unit, she
also had a Legionella antigen sent, which was negative.  The
patient did well overnight in the Medical Intensive Care
Unit, and was ultimately extubated the following morning.
The following day, the patient was stable enough to be
discharged to the Medical floor.  However, several hours
later, she was noted to complain of increasing worsening
dyspnea and was found to be diaphoretic and tachycardic to
the 140s.  Her electrocardiogram showed atrial fibrillation
which was newly documented.  Arterial blood gas done shortly
thereafter was 7.28/56/126.  Her chest x-ray was consistent
with congestive heart failure.  The patient got several doses
of intravenous Lopressor and intravenous Diltiazem to lower
her heart rate to the 80s.  Her blood pressure was stable in
the 110s to 120s.  The patient was given a total of 120 mg of
intravenous lasix in 40 to 80 mg increments, and diuresed
approximately 500 cc with symptomatic improvement in her
degree of dyspnea.

The patient was subsequently transferred to the Coronary Care
Unit on [**2153-6-25**] for more careful monitoring in the setting of
her new atrial fibrillation and her second episode of
congestive heart failure.  On arrival to the Coronary Care
Unit, the patient was resting comfortably, without any
complaints of chest pain, shortness of breath, and
palpitations.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Hypertension, well controlled on an ACE inhibitor
2.  History of "asthma," from which the patient gets
symptomatic relief with her metered dose inhalers at home
3.  History of thyroid surgery
4.  Remote history of gastrointestinal bleed secondary to
diverticula
5.  History of aortic insufficiency by prior echocardiograms
6.  History of prior hospitalization in [**2153-2-9**] at
[**Hospital6 1597**] with possible congestive heart failure,
possible pneumonia
7.  History of [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]-[**Doctor Last Name **] tear secondary to vomiting

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS AT HOME:  The patient was on Zestril and Advair.

MEDICATIONS ON TRANSFER TO THE CORONARY CARE UNIT:
[**Unit Number **].  Aspirin 325 mg by mouth once daily
2.  Lopressor 50 mg by mouth twice a day
3.  Captopril 37.5 mg by mouth three times a day
4.  Lasix 40 mg by mouth once daily
5.  Lipitor 20 mg by mouth once daily

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient smoked cigarettes for
approximately 20 years, but quit 50 years ago.  She denies
alcohol.  She lives alone, and is highly functional and walks
with a cane.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:   On admission, vital signs:
Temperature 98.4, pulse 75, blood pressure 106/55,
respiratory rate 28, pulse oxygenation 97% on 5 liters nasal
cannula.  Of note, these are the vital signs at the time of
transfer to the Coronary Care Unit on [**2153-6-25**].  General
appearance:  The patient is awake, sleepy-appearing,
breathing comfortably, in no acute distress.  Head, eyes,
ears, nose and throat:  Pupils equal, round and reactive to
light, extraocular movements intact, sclerae anicteric, moist
mucous membranes, no appreciable oral lesions.  Neck:
Jugular venous distention was elevated at approximately 15
cm.  No carotid bruits were appreciated.  Cardiovascular:
Irregularly irregular rhythm with a II/VI systolic ejection
murmur best heard over the left upper sternal border.  Lungs
were notable for decreased breath sounds at the bases
bilaterally, with trace crackles a third of the way up
bilaterally.  The abdomen was soft, nontender, nondistended,
with active bowel sounds.  Extremities:  1 to 2+ edema to the
mid-calf bilaterally.  Rectal examination notable for
external hemorrhoids.  The patient was guaiac negative.
Neurologic examination:  Patient moving all four extremities.
Strength was [**5-13**] and equal bilaterally in upper and lower
extremities.

LABORATORY DATA:  At the time of transfer to the Coronary
Care Unit, hematocrit 44.3, platelets 208, lactate 2.6,
magnesium 1.8, INR 1.2.  Sodium 146, potassium 4.0, chloride
105, bicarbonate 26, BUN 33, creatinine 1.4, glucose 153.
Urinalysis was negative.  Arterial blood gas at the time of
transfer to the Intensive Care Unit was 7.32/52/141.
Electrocardiogram at that time was notable for atrial
fibrillation at 105 beats per minute with a left bundle
branch block.  Chest x-ray revealed bilateral interstitial
markings consistent with congestive heart failure, right
greater than left.  Echocardiogram on the morning of [**6-25**]
notable for an ejection fraction of 40% with a mild symmetric
left ventricular hypertrophy, normal right ventricular
function, 2+ aortic regurgitation, and 2+ mitral
regurgitation, as well as a dyskinetic left ventricle.

HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM:
1.  Cardiovascular:  Patient with a history of hypertension
and longstanding aortic insufficiency who presented with
acute dyspnea consistent with congestive heart failure.  It
was initially thought that the patient might have an ischemic
etiology to her symptoms given echocardiogram revealing new
wall motion abnormalities and new mitral regurgitation as
well as mild troponin elevation.  Given that the patient had
a second episode of similar symptoms during her hospital stay
in the setting of atrial fibrillation which was newly
documented, it is possible that her initial presentation was
also related to poorly rate controlled atrial fibrillation.
However, it is also very possible that the patient has
underlying coronary disease.  By report, she has had a prior
admission to an outside hospital with congestive heart
failure within the past six months.

During this hospital stay, the patient was continued on
Lopressor and Captopril.  She was gradually switched over
from Captopril to a daily dose of Lisinopril.  At 20 mg of
Lisinopril, she became hypotensive to the 80s, and this was
switched back to 10 mg by mouth once daily on [**2153-6-28**].  She
was also maintained on an aspirin once daily.

After a lengthy discussion with the patient and family
regarding benefits and risks of cardiac catheterization, the
patient was taken to the catheterization laboratory on
[**2153-6-28**].  Cardiac catheterization at that time revealed a
left anterior descending with a proximal 40% and a mid-80%
lesion, with distal diffuse disease.  The left anterior
descending was noted to be small compared to the left
circumflex.  The left circumflex was the dominant artery,
with a 70% mid-left circumflex and an 80% left posterior
descending artery.  The patient received rotablation and
stenting of the left posterior descending artery with a 10%
residual stenosis.  The right coronary art
