Penicillins

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2485**]
Chief Complaint:
dyspnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
This is an 83 y/o female with moderate AS, s/p MVR [**57**] years ago,
s/p PPM, DM, CHF, p/w dsypnea and increased work of breathing x
4-5 days. Per family, the patient has had worsening CHF/volume
overload over the last several weeks, requiring supplemental O2
at rehab. Over the last few days, she has been noted to be more
short of breath and having sats to 60% on RA. Her lasix was
increased to 60 mg [**Hospital1 **]. Beginning today, she was noted to be in
hypoxic respiratory distress, 87-91% on 2L/NC. She was increased
to 5L, with her sats going up to 97%. She was also noted to be
more confused over the last few days and especially today. She
was given lasix and 2 mg IV morphine at [**Hospital 100**] Rehab, and sent
to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation. En route, she was given
additional lasix of 60 mg IV and nitro spray x 2.
.
In the ED, her VS were Tc 97.2, BP 146/25, HR 70, RR 27, SaO2
95%/NRB. Foley was placed in ED. She was given 40 mg IV lasix
and 325 mg ASA. She was placed on BiPAP for comfort at 30% FiO2,
5 PEEP, 12 PS. Admitted to the MICU for further management.
.
Per family, besides the dyspnea and SOB, the patient has had no
other symptoms, including f/c/s, CP, palpitations, abd pain,
n/v/diarrhea. She has had decreased appetite over the last few
days in the context of increasing confusion.

.
Echo: The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric
left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size
is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF 70%). There is no ventricular septal defect. The right
ventricular free wall is hypertrophied. The right ventricular
cavity is dilated. Right ventricular systolic function appears
depressed. The aortic arch is mildly dilated. There are focal
calcifications in the aortic arch. There are three aortic valve
leaflets. The aortic valve  leaflets are moderately thickened.
There is at least moderate aortic valve  stenosis. A bileaflet
mitral valve prosthesis is present. The gradients are higher
than expected for this type of prosthesis. The tricuspid valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is moderate pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. The end-diastolic pulmonic
regurgitation velocity is increased  suggesting pulmonary artery
diastolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
effusion. Compared with the findings of the prior study (images
reviewed) of [**2144-3-3**], the pressure gradient across the
mitral valve prosthesis is increased.
.
IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**4-14**] through 26: Mild
pulmonary edema is unchanged. Bilateral pleural effusion small
on the right and moderate on the left is stable. Severe
cardiomegaly and left lower lobe atelectasis unchanged. No
pneumothorax. Transvenous right ventricular pacer lead in
standard placement.
.
ECG: Ventricular paced rhythm. Compared to the previous tracing
of [**2145-4-14**] no significant change.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P - 83yo F with valvular disorder, AF, and h/o CAD a/w
hypercarbic respiratory failure.
.
# Respiratory failure- She was admitted to the MICU for her
repiratory failure which was thought to be secondary to CHF.  Pt
was diuresed with iv lasix/acetazolamide and given iv
morphine/prn for respiratory distress and BIPAP was tried.
However, hypercarbia ([**12-25**] metabolic alkalosis) remained in the
90s.  Pt was mentating okay, having conversations with
intermittent somnolence despite hypercarbia.  TTE showed
preserved EF with moderate AS and moderate MS and mod pulm HTN.
Cardiology was consulted and thought MS [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 34106**] to her
pulm edema and pulm HTN.  Cardiology recommended d/cing digoxin
and starting amiodarone.  Family declined valvuloplasty.  For
possible COPD, pt was started on steroids and nebs on [**4-18**].  Pt
is currently satting 90s on 1 L NC while sitting in a chair but
needs more O2 when supine.  Pt is a mouth breather and
occasionally needs a face mask.  Pt will need I/Os monitored to
goal even to slightly negative as she was diursed 4.8 L during
her MICU stay.  Depending on her I/O, lasix and acetazolamide
can be decreased or discontinued.  If she were to decompensate
at the rehab, goals of care will need to be readdressed.
.
# h/o CAD - There were new changes on EKG but pt was ruled out
with 3 sets of negative cardiac enzymes.  Pt was continued on
BB, ASA, and nitrates.
.
# Acid/base status - Respiratory acidosis with metabolic
compensation. Appears to be chronic in nature given degree of
metabolic compensation with acute component earlier today.  Pt
failed BIPAP and pCO2 remained in the 90s but maintaining
mentation.
.
# Renal insufficiency - baseline Cr unknown, may have CRI from
DM.  Creatinine stayed stable from 1.3-1.5.  Will need to
renally dose all medications.
.
# A fib - continued BB.  Per cardiology consult recs,
discontinued digoxin and started amiodarone.  Due to elevated
INR, coumadin was held.  Pt is also paced.  Pt needs to be on
amiodarone 400mg [**Hospital1 **] x 7 days (loading dose) and then 400mg
daily for maintenance.
.
# DM - insulin standing + HISS, FS qid
.
# Depression - continuedhome regimen
.
# F/E/N - NPO initially while on BIPAP and now low sodium
cardiac diet.
.
# PPx - supratherpeutic INR
.
# Access - PIV
.
# Code - DNR/DNI. No pressors or central line per HCP. If she
were to decompensate at the rehab, goals of care will need to be
readressed.
