History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 51497**] is a 51 year old man with a history of recent
hospitalization
([**Date range (1) 66044**]) following motor vehicle accident with resultant
left subdural hematoma status post drainage, subarachnoid
hemorrhage, right frontal contusion, left occipital stroke,
bilateral open ankle fractures, right eye hematoma, T11/T12
burst fractures status post posterior arthrodesis lateral mass
screws from T8-L2 who was discharged to rehab on [**12-6**] where he
became more confused and was noted to be minimally responsive
with rightward gaze yesterday prompting his return to [**Hospital1 18**].
[**Hospital1 **] notes indicate that on admission on [**12-6**], he was
"alert and oriented x 1 with intact upper extremity strength, he
was unable to cooperate in a full exam". Then, on [**12-10**] he was
noted to have "an acute change in mental status." Per notes, he
became unresponsive, with increased respiratory rate. Exam at
that time notable for normal vital signs, unresponsiveness, eyes
deviated to the right, decreased movement of his right arm.  He
received 2mg ativan with little change in exam.  He was then
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]. In the emergency department, he was found
to be febrile  to 101.8.  He was intubated for airway protection
and CT Scan.  He was started on ceftriaxone, vancomycin, and
Ampicillin.  He was then transferred to the MICU.


Past Medical History:
1. Coronary artery disease
2. Mechanical aortic valve replacement.
3. Motor vehical accident in [**11-11**] left subdural hematoma status
post drainage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, right frontal contusion,
left occipital stroke, bilateral open ankle fractures status
post external fixation, right eye hematoma complicated by MRSA
infection, T11/T12 burst fractures status post posterior
arthrodesis lateral mass screws from T8-L2.
4. Alcohol abuse
5. Tobacco dependence

Social History:
He lived with his family prior to accident.  He has a 20 pack
year
smoking history.  He had a history of intermittent heavy alcohol
use and normally drinks 2-4 drinks per day.


Family History:
His mother had hypercholesterolemia.  There is no history
coronary artery disease.

CV: Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 and S2, 2/6 systolic
ejection murmur, mechanical aortic click
Lung: Course breath sounds anteriorly
Abdomen: soft, slightly distended, tender around PEG site

Imaging:
1. 2. Chest x-ray: Subtle alveolar opacities in the right upper
lung zone and left retrocardiac region; the former was seen on
the prior chest x-ray. These may relate to either pneumonia or
asymmetric congestive heart failure.  ETT well positioned;
balloon cuff mildly overinflated
.
2. CT Head: Resolving products of intracranial hemorrhages, seen
previously. Status post craniectomy. Larger size of low
attenuation chronic subdural collection along the left frontal
convexity, now 8 mm in diameter, and also with perhaps slightly
greater rightward shift of normally midline structures.
Increased size of the supratentorial ventricles

CT head [**2194-2-10**]: Comparison with the prior study of [**2-3**]
reveals no significant interval change in either the extent of
the previously noted epidural fluid collection subjacent to and
marginated by the craniotomy flap nor the low density areas seen
within the right frontal and left occipital- temporal portions
of the brain. There are no new areas of intracranial hemorrhage,
mass effect or shift of normally midline structures. The
surrounding osseous and soft tissue structures, as well, are
unaltered in appearance.

.
3. CT Abd/Pelvis: Interval decrease in size of left rectus
abdominal muscle inflammation. No abscess visualized in this
region or within the abdomen. Small bibasilar pleural effusions
with atelectasis.
.
4. Lower extremity x-rays: External fixation devices intact with
evidence of healing fractures.
.
5. CT C spine: Healing nondisplaced transverse process fractures
of T2, T1, and C7 are unchanged.  No large paraspinal abscess is
seen.


Brief Hospital Course:
This is 51 year-old man with a history of recent hospitalization
([**Date range (1) 66044**]) following motor vehicle accident who was admitted
following an episode of unresponsiveness accompanied by
rightward eye deviation.
.
1. Change in mental status: His presentation of unresponsiveness
and right eye deviation was thought to be initially possibly
seizure activity or a stroke.  On admission, he was
subtherapuetic on coumadin and heparin, therefore a stroke was
possible given that he had a mechanical valve.  A head CT was
negative for a stroke.  His dilantin level was also
subtherapeutic.  His intracranial bleed, underlying infection,
hyponatremia, and hypomagnesemia could all lower his seizure
threshold.  An EEG was consistent with encephelopathy but did
not show any seizure focus.  He was reloaded with dilantin and
was maintained on dilantin and then converted to Keppra.
Initially, he required a 1:1 sitter and restraints as he
continued to pull at lines.  His mental status improved such
that he was oriented to place and time occasionally and was no
longer agitated.  By the end of his hospital stay he was
oriented to person, place and date. He occasionally forgot the
name of the hospital.
.
2. Infection: On admission, he had a leukocytosis.  Given his
altered mental status, there was concern for an underlying
infectious etiology.  There was initially concern for an
epidural abscess given his back wound; however, a CT was
negative for any paraspinal collection.  An MRI could not be
performed secondary to his mechanical valve.  A lumbar puncture
to look for menigitis was deemed to risky given the risk of
seeding infection through the back wound.   His back wound grew
enterobactercloacae and MRSA.  One set of admission cultures
grew coag neg staph (unclear if real vs. contaminant), PICC line
tip (not blood culture) grew MRSA. Subsequent blood cultures
were negative, and he completed a 2 week course vancomycin and
meropenem on [**12-27**].  He has been afebrile for weeks now with no
sign of
re-infection.

His mental status improved with antibiotic treat
