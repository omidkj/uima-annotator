Allergies:
Nafcillin

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2181**]
Chief Complaint:
Epidural abscess and vertebral osteomyelitis and discitis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**8-9**]: s/p L thoracotomy, vertebrectomy T10, partial
vertebrectomy T11, instrumented fusion T9-T11. Chest tube to 20
cm H2O continuous suction.
[**8-14**]: Rigid bronchoscopy x2. Removed chest tube.
[**8-15**]: posterior spinal fusion T5-L2, est blood loss 1050 mL
transfused 3 u PRBC, 2 U FFP.


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 32493**] is a 45yo man with ESRD on HD, DM, h/o "staph
bacteremia" in [**Month (only) 547**] for which he was treated at an OSH, h/o
T11-12 discitis in [**Month (only) 116**] who presents as a transfer from [**Hospital **]
Hospital with report of possible epidural abcess.  MRI was read
at OSH (by attg) as T11-12 discitis vs. osteomyelitis with a
possible epidural abcess and small cord compression. He was
transferred here for neurosurgical eval and was seen by ortho
spine team in the ER.  The ortho and radiology residents
examined the MRI and are not convinced the pt has epidural
abcess, although are unsure. The pt was admitted to medicine for
perioperative management.

Ct [**Location **] - Anterior wedge deformities of T10 and T11 with
moderate kyphosis.  There is fragmentation and destruction of
the inferior T10 and superior T12 endplates concerning for
osteomyelitis/discitis.  Surrounding soft tissue density may
represent phelgmon.  No paraspinal fluid collections identified.
 CT does not provide intrathecal detail, and MRI is recommeded
for further evaluation of the spinal cord.
.
MR [**Name13 (STitle) **] at OSH: T11-12 discitis vs osteomyelitis with possible
epidural abcess and some possible cord compression
.
1)Cxray ([**8-10**]): Improved aeration of the left lower lobe.
.
2)Cxray ([**8-12**]): New complete opacification of the left
hemithorax with associated minimal right to left shift of the
trachea likely reflects underlying effusion and atelectasis,
cannot exclude pneumonia.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 32493**] is a 45yo male transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] from [**Hospital1 25157**] where he presented to the ER with c/o chronic,
severe lower back pain & weakness in his LE bilaterally.
.
BACK PAIN/OSTEOMYELITIS
On arrival to ER was given Dilaudid 1 mg IV with no relief & was
subsequently given morphine 7 mg IV.  Stat MRI of the spine was
ordered which showed "Progression of osteomyelitis versus
discitis at the T10-T11 region with further collapse.  Possible
pus in the disc space.  There is compression of the anterior
cord which is significantly increased from [**2124-5-26**]."
.
Per neurosurgery at [**Hospital1 **] (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 73785**] pt would need surgery
with anterior approach & thus transfer to tertiary care
facility.  Patient was discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 8494**] at [**Hospital1 18**] and
transferred in stable condition.
.
Mr. [**Known lastname 32493**] was seen in [**Hospital1 18**] ER by ortho spine team; ortho
spine and radiology residents examined MRI from OSH and were not
convinced of presence of epidural abscess, although unsure.
Patient was thus admitted to medicine service for perioperative
management.
.
In our ED he received Dilaudid for pain, a CT of his T-spine and
additional blood cultures were drawn.  CT of T-spine showed
"Anterior wedge deformities of T10 & T11 with moderate kyphosis.
 There is fragmentation and destruction of inferior T10 and
superior T12 endplates concerning for osteomyelitis/discitis.
Surrounding soft tissue density may represent phlegmon.  No
paraspinal fluid collections identified."  Further orthopedics
consult recommended non-emergent surgical decompression and
debridement due to failure of medical management and progression
of symptoms.
.
Renal was made aware of pt with ESRD who receives scheduled HD
on MWF & recommended to hold colchicine in HD patient.  ID also
consulted on day of admission ([**8-5**]) and advised to hold abx and
perform TTE prior to surgery (performed [**8-7**] which showed no
vegitations).  Patient was made NPO overnight for surgery the
following morning and coags/type & screen were sent.  Surgery
not performed [**8-6**], was examined by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 363**] of neurosurgery
for 2nd opinion who also recommended anterior/posterior
decompression with fusion.
.
Patient went to OR [**2124-8-9**] for L thoracotomy with T10
vertebrectomy and T11 partial vertebrectomy with fusion/anterior
cage placement T9-T11.  Patient remained sedated on propafol &
intubated with L pleural chest tube post-operatively and was
extubated [**8-10**], mom[**Name (NI) 11711**] placed on CPAP and weaned to O2 by
NC.  For pain control pt received dilaudid PCA with scheduled
dilaudid 2 mg Q 2 hours.
.
Started on IV nafcillin for history of recurrent MSSA
bacteremia; on POD#3 operative tissue cultures grew MSSA,
confirming this diagnosis.

Patient also noted to be tachycardic post-operatively, most
likely due to uncontrolled pain, and required increase in
lopressor dose.
.
Patient remained sedated on propafol and intubated and was sent
back to OR on [**8-15**] for completion of posterior spinal fusion.
.
Post-operatively patient received care in MICU and antibiotics
were changed back to IV nafcillin.  Per ID recs, would need at
least a [**10-6**] week course of cefazolin due to his h/o recurrent
MSSA bacteremia.  He will then likely require lifetime
suppressive therapy. ID follow-up needs are described in page
1/discharge instructions.
.
As he recovered from the problems described below, he continued
to have flares of intense back pain which we attempted to
control.
.
He was successfully moved out of bed with a torso brace on, on
[**8-30**]. Physical therapy continuing to work with Mr [**Known lastname 32493**] to
facilitate his recovery. Current neuro exam: hard to assess
weakness in this context, possible L weaker than R; loss of
sensation of first three toes of L toe.
.
RESPIRATORY FAILURE
During HD POD#3 ([**8-12**]) patient noted to have O2 sat of 80% and
with NRB recovered sats to 99%.  CXR showed complete
opacification of L lung and patient was transferred to MICU Team
[**Location (un) **] for respiratory distress.  At that time differential dx
was mucous plugging vs. L chest tube malfunction and per surgery
patient was noted to have ++ secretions.
.
In MICU patient was started on face mask, empiric ceftriaxone
and azithromycin for CAP, atrovent & albuterol neb treatments.
Sputum samples were sent for culture.  Patient was bronched [**8-13**]
@ 17:30 by the MICU service.  Thick, purulent, mucoid secretions
were visualized in the L mainstem and L lingula.  BAL was
perfomed in the lingula after which he developed copious fresh
blood requiring intubation.  Post bronch CXR (17:45) actually
revealed an aerated L lung with significant improvement.
.
He was bronched again at 19:30 which revealed thick secretions
in the L mainstem and the end of the ETT.  Post-bronch CXR
(19:45) demonstrated L PTX and again L white-out.Later that day
patient was intubated & bronchoscopy was performed which showed
thick, purulent secretions in L mainstem a
