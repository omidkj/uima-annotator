Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:

Contrast Media

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2712**]
Chief Complaint:
Hypotension

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 70-year-old man with a complicated medical
history that includes ERSD with cadaveric renal transplant,
coronary artery disease with multiple interventions, sCHF with
ejection fraction of 20%, diabetes, hypertension,
hyperlipidemia, gout, spinal stenosis, atrial fibrillation who
recently underwent amputation of his second right toe, fifth
right ray and debridement of right heel who is presenting with
hypotension. The patient was discovered at his rehab facility
today to have reddening of the sclerae of his right eye. The
patient reports that he had a brief period of double vision in
the morning, but no other visual symptoms. He complains only of
irritation of the right eye at the moment. Because the patient
is anticoagulated, his nurse at the rehab facility was
concerned. An ambulance was called and the patient's [**First Name3 (LF) **]
pressure was discovered to be 70/40.

On appearance on the Emergency Department, the patient continued
to be hypotensive in the 70s and 80s, though mentating well. He
initially refused any central line, but was willing to accept
peripheral pressors, so he was started on norepinephrine. When
that was maximized and his [**First Name3 (LF) **] pressure had still not much
recovered, discussion was initiated and he accepted the
placement of a right IJ, at which point a second pressor,
phenylephrine, was added. He continued to require both pressors
in order to achieve an adequate [**First Name3 (LF) **] pressure.

Imaging:
[**2189-10-13**] CXR:
IMPRESSION:
Left basilar opacity may reflect atelectasis but infection is
not excluded.  Small left pleural effusion.  Low lung volumes.

CT abdomen and pelvis:
IMPRESSION:
1. There is anasarca, bilateral pleural effusions, and
mild-to-moderate
ascites within the abdomen.
2. Atelectasis/ consolidation is seen at the lung bases,
improved from
previous.
3. Again appreciated is severe diffuse atherosclerosis involving
the aorta and all branch vessels.  The native kidneys are
severely atrophic and the right lower quadrant renal transplant
appears unremarkable.
4. Sigmoid diverticulae. There is mottled gas pattern in the
sigmoid colon, favoured to represent air in diverticulae.
Pneumatosis is less likely. Clinical assessment is recommended.



Brief Hospital Course:
The patient is a 70-year-old man with a complicated medical
history that includes ERSD with cadaveric renal transplant,
coronary artery disease with multiple interventions, sCHF with
ejection fraction of 20%, diabetes, hypertension,
hyperlipidemia, gout, spinal stenosis, atrial fibrillation who
recently underwent amputation of his second right toe, fifth
right ray and debridement of right heel who is presenting with
hypotension. The patient's hypotension is of unclear etiology,
but was supected to be secondary to sepsis. He had not been
febrile or had a white count. He has a recent intervention to
his right foot that may be a possible site of infection,
although his wounds currently do not have obvious visual
evidence of infection. His urinalysis has small leuks and few
bacteria (but no pyuria). CXR and CT abdomen not suggestive of
specific  He has been on longstanding prednisone. SVO2 not
suggestive of cardiogenic shock. Due to a CVP of around 30, no
additional fluids were provided. The patient was started on
broad-spectrum coverage with vancomycin, levofloxacin, and
aztreonam. (The patient once had an anaphylactic reaction to
penicillins.) He was also placed on [**Month/Day/Year **]-dose steroids.
[**Month/Day/Year **] Surgery was consulted, but intervention would likely
have been a below-the-knee amputation. On [**2189-10-14**] in the early
afternoon, the patient's pressor requirement suddenly increased.
He then developed a wide complex bradyarrhythmia with poor
perfusion and mottling of his appendages. In keeping with his
wishes against aggressive resuscitation, the patient's family
was informed of his grave prognosis. No additional pressor was
added, and the patient expired in the early afternoon of
[**2189-10-14**], likely secondary to a cardiac event caused by the
strain of his likely sepsis.
