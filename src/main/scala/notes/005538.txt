Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 8487**]
Chief Complaint:
Neutropenic fever / epigastric pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Bone marrow biopsy.
PICC line removal.
Tunneled line placement.
Bone marrow biopsy.

History of Present Illness:
38 y/o female with history of ALL, diagnosed [**9-23**], status post
complete remission induced by five cycles of chemotherapy but
with recent relapse by bone marrow biopsy [**2135-6-13**] status post
admission for reinduction chemotherapy [**Date range (1) 18555**] who presented to
the ED from home with epigastric pain and fevers.
.
Her admission was prompted first by a call to the [**Date range (1) 3242**] floor at
approx 9pm on [**6-29**] with concerns that she was not feeling well.
She noted epigastric pain for approximately three days
associated with diarrhea and nausea. She was directed to call
the [**Month/Year (2) 3242**] fellow on call, and when she mentioned fever to 100.2
associated with chills and rigors, she was directed to the ED
for evaluation.
.
In the ED her vitals with T 99.1 orally, HR 109, BP 128/87, RR
16, and satting 100% on RA. She received 2gm cefepime, IV
dilaudid, and was pan-cultured. CXR was without evidence for
pneumonia. She was guiac negative. No CT scan was performed.
.
On review of systems, she denies cough, shortness of breath, or
diaphoresis. Her diarrhea has resolved, but her abdominal pain
continues.  She notes it has been occurring since tuesday, is
worse with eating, and is constant all day and evening.

Past Medical History:
PAST ONCOLOGIC HISTORY:
# Her ALL was diagnosed in [**9-23**], [**Location (un) 5622**] chromosome
negative.  She underwent 4 cycles of part A and part B hyperCVAD
and 1 cycle of maintenance therapy.  As above, she had a recent

STUDIES
.
CT CHEST ([**2135-7-13**]):
New bilateral pleural effusions are very tiny. Dependent
ground-glass opacity in both bases clears in inspiration and
prone imaging and are due to air trapping. One 9 x 7 mm bulla in
right lower lobe is unchanged (4A:106). Lungs are otherwise
clear. There is no lymph node enlargement using CT criteria.
There is no pericardial effusion. Airways are patent to the
subsegmental level. This study was not tailored for
subdiaphragmatic evaluation except to note clips in the upper
abdomen. Bones are normal.
IMPRESSION:
1. New very tiny bilateral pleural effusions.
2. Otherwise, normal exam. No findings of infection.
.
RUQ ULTRASOUND ([**2135-7-7**]):
The liver is diffusely echogenic. No focal liver lesions are
identified. There is no intrahepatic biliary ductal dilation.
The CBD is likely nondilated, though could not be specifically
identified. Portal venous flow is hepatopetal. The kidneys are
normal without hydronephrosis. The aorta is normal caliber. The
spleen and pancreas are normal.
IMPRESSION: Echogenic liver most likely fatty infiltration. More
severe forms of liver disease such as cirrhosis and fibrosis
cannot be excluded on the basis of this examination.
.
PELVIC ULTRASOUND ([**2135-7-7**]):
IMPRESSION:
1. Heterogeneous 9 mm enodmetrium with possible focal
endometrial lesion.
Follow up or son[**Name (NI) 18556**] could be performed if desired,
for further
evaluation of the endometrium.
2. 9 mm right adnexal cyst which today has the appearance of a
paraovarian
cyst.
4. Enlarging fibroids (largest 2.8 cm).
.
LUE ULTRASOUND [**7-6**]:
No evidence of DVT involving the left upper extremity.
.
BONE MARROW BIOPSY [**7-6**]:
DIAGNOSIS:
Relapsed B-acute lymphoblastic leukemia.  The biopsy material is
adequate for evaluation.  The bone marrow cellularity is 80-90%.
 Bony trabecula are focally thickened.  There is an interstitial
infiltrate of immature cells consistent with blasts occurring in
sheets occupying 90% of marrow cellularity.   In the remaining
hematopoiesis, the M:E ratio estimate is decreased.  Erythroid
precursors are decreased and exhibit maturation.  Myeloid
elements are markedly decreased and exhibit maturation.
Megakaryocytes are decreased.  Abnormal forms are not seen.
Focal loose clustering is noted.   Compared to a previous
M08-407, S08-[**Numeric Identifier 18557**], the current biopsy shows greater cellularity
comprised mostly of blasts with similar morphology to those seen
on the prior biopsy.
.
TTE [**7-19**]:
The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. Left
ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global
systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve appears
structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is
no mitral valve prolapse. There is borderline pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
