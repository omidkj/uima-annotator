day p.o. q.h.s., digoxin 250 mcg p.o. q.day, Lescol 40 mg
p.o. q.day, Lasix 20 mg p.o. q.day, fluticasone two puffs
q.12 hours, Ditropan 5 mg p.o. q.day, Combivent two puffs
t.i.d., potassium chloride 10 mEq p.o. q.day.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Significant for 30 pack year smoking history
as well as a two drinks per day alcohol history.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Significant for unspecified valvular disease
as well as diabetes mellitus.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient was afebrile, vital signs
stable, sating 98 percent in room air.  In no apparent
distress.  Alert and oriented times three.  Head was
normocephalic, atraumatic, no scleral icterus noted.  Neck
was soft and supple, no masses and no bruits noted.  Heart
was regular rate and rhythm with a grade 2/6 systolic
ejection murmur.  Chest was clear to auscultation bilaterally
with no rhonchi or rales.  Abdomen was soft, nondistended,
nontender with positive bowel sounds.  Rectal exam was
deferred.  Extremities were without cyanosis, clubbing or
edema.  Neuro exam was without any deficits.

LABORATORY DATA:  The patient had an echocardiogram on [**2114-4-10**]
which showed moderate dilation of the left atrium, moderate
dilation of the right atrium, moderate left ventricular
hypertrophy, EF 60 percent, moderately dilated aortic root,
mildly dilated ascending aorta, severe aortic stenosis, 1+
aortic regurg, mild mitral stenosis, 1 to 2+ mitral regurg.
Cardiac cath on [**2114-4-9**] demonstrated no flow limiting disease,
severe aortic stenosis, hyperdynamic ventricular function and
moderate pulmonary hypertension.  Chest x-ray on [**2114-4-10**]
showed left ventricular hypertrophy, no evidence of
congestive heart failure, aortic valve calcification,
bibasilar linear atelectasis.  Carotid ultrasound on [**2114-4-18**]
demonstrated bilateral stenosis of the internal carotid
arteries of less than 40 percent.

HO[**Last Name (STitle) **] COURSE:  The patient is an 80 year old female with
severe AS admitted for preoperative anticoagulation with IV
heparin with a plan to go to the O.R. for AVR and MVR.  The
patient was admitted to cardiac surgery, Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) **]
attending, and was started on a heparin drip with no bolus at
700 with goal PTT between 50 and 70.  On hospital day two the
patient was atrially paced up to a heart rate of 110.
Electrophysiology cardiology was consulted and as a result
settings of the pacemaker were changed to 70 with suppression
algorithm off and rate response off.

Th[**Last Name (STitle) 1050**] was taken to the O.R. on [**2114-4-25**] for AVR and MVR
with a 23 mm pericardial aortic valve and a 27 mm mosaic pig
mitral valve.  Surgeon was Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) **].  For a more
detailed account, please see operative report.
Postoperatively the patient was transferred to the CSRU.
Immediately postoperatively the patient went into atrial
fibrillation dysrhythmia and was placed on amiodarone IV.
The patient also had pressor requirements with FEN
Neo-Synephrine.  Chest tubes were discontinued on
postoperative day two.  Also postoperatively the EP staff
recommended changes to the pacemaker with DDD of 60.  They
also recommended continuing amiodarone and beta blocker.

On postoperative day one EP noted that the patient was in an
atrial tachycardiac rhythm with a 2:1 AV block.
Recommendations were as stated above.  The patient was
extubated on postoperative day one without difficulty.  On
postoperative day two the patient was started on p.o.
amiodarone.  On postoperative day four the patient continued
to be in and out of atrial tachycardiac rhythm.  However,
later in the day the patient went down to a heart rate of 71
ventricularly paced.  On postoperative day five the patient
was transferred to the floor in stable condition.

The patient was complaining of some right sided arm and back
pain which was alleviated by Darvocet.  The patient has a
history of arthritic back pain.  EP's final recommendations
included amiodarone 400 mg p.o. b.i.d. and anticoagulation
with Coumadin until further followup.  On postoperative day
six the patient was doing very well.  Vitals stable, heart
rate 64 paced, blood pressure 117/58 with no oxygen
requirements.  The patient was 3 kg above preoperative
weight.  The patient was started on Coumadin on [**2114-4-30**] with
a dose of 2.  The patient is to resume preoperative regimen
of 4 and 2 mg of Coumadin alternating every day.  The patient
was recommended for rehabilitation by physical therapy and
the patient was deemed well enough to be discharged there on
postoperative day six.
