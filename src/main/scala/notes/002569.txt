Admission Date:  [**2181-1-12**]       Discharge Date:  [**2181-1-26**]

Date of Birth:   [**2133-8-30**]       Sex:  F

Service:  [**Doctor Last Name 1181**]
ID:  The patient is a 47 year-old female with chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease flare/aspiration pneumonia status post
extubation in the Operating Room transferred from MICU to [**Doctor Last Name **]
Medicine Service.

female with a past medical history significant for juvenile
rheumatoid arthritis, type 1 diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism,
asthma/chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, encephalitis with
intubation leading to vocal cord paralysis, multiple pneumonias
each year, who initially presented on [**1-7**]
Hospital in [**Location (un) 8973**], [**State 350**].  At that time she reported
a one day history of fever, nausea and vomiting and was diagnosed
with viral gastroenteritis.  While hospitalized she became
dyspneic with wheezing and was started on Levofloxacin on [**1-9**] for a positive infiltrate on chest x-ray for possible
aspiration pneumonia, and then on Timentin on [**1-11**] when
there was no improvement.  Her condition worsened on [**1-12**]
with shortness of breath and the patient was bronched revealing
edematous vocal cords.  During her bronchoscopy the patient had
to be intubated for airway protection due to loss of airway.  The
patient was noted to have a "difficult airway."

The patient was then transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] at [**Hospital1 346**] for further airway management.  She
was then transferred to the MICU on [**1-18**].  While in the
Intensive Care Unit at [**Hospital1 18**] she was treated for aspiration
pneumonia as well as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease exacerbation with Solu-Medrol 80 mg intravenous q 8
hours, Levofloxacin and Clindamycin.  Cultures were negative.
Legionella antigen was negative.  She was also treated with
Albuterol and Atrovent nebulizers.  Tube feeds were started
on [**1-13**] due to aspiration risk.  Aggressive pulmonary
toilet was continued on [**1-18**].  High risk extubation was
done in the Operating Room and the patient was moved to the
PACU in stable pulmonary status.  The patient was then
transferred to the medical floor.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1. Encephalitis in [**2164**] requiring
intubation.  2.  Status post intubation in [**2164**] from
encephalitis.  Vocal cord paralysis injury.  3. Asthma/chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease.  4.  Pneumonia each year.  5. Type
1 diabetes mellitus.  6.  Juvenile rheumatoid arthritis.  7.
Hypothyroidism for twenty years. 8.  Depression.

In [**2164**] she presented to St. [**Hospital **] Hospital in [**Location (un) 8973**],
[**State 350**] in [**Month (only) **] with a three week history of headache,
swollen legs and extreme fatigue.  She was admitted to the
hospital with diagnosis of meningitis and treated with
antibiotics.  Apparently she got worse and went in to a coma
and was then transferred to [**Hospital3 2576**] [**Hospital3 **] with diagnosis
of encephalitis apparently from a mosquito bite.  Her hospital
stay was approximately months while in a coma for about three
weeks as per the patient.  She was intubated at that time, which
then resulted in a vocal cord paralysis. Since then she reports
having pneumonia each year requiring admission to the hospital at
St. [**Doctor First Name **] for approximately one week stays without intubation.

She reports her history of type 1 diabetes mellitus starting
when she was four years old.  At four years old she was also
diagnosed with malaria at the time she was living in [**Country 480**]
and [**Country 37027**].  The patient was born in [**Country 6257**].

Her history of juvenile rheumatoid arthritis started with
hand deformities as well as deformities of the feet at 11
years old.  Her chronic obstructive pulmonary disease was
diagnosed approximately three years ago.  Her asthma was
diagnosed around the time she had encephalitis in [**2164**].

ALLERGIES:  Sulfa drugs, which she reports having a rash
reaction.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  She quit smoking fifteen years ago.  At that
time she had been smoking one pack per day.  She reports no
alcohol use or intravenous drug use.  Her mother's phone
number is [**Telephone/Fax (1) 37028**].

MEDICATIONS (ON TRANSFER):  NPH, Riss Dulcolax, heparin subQ,
Prozac, Tylenol, intravenous fluids, Ativan, Fleets enema,
Prednisone, Colace, Levofloxacin, Clindamycin, Synthroid,
Albuterol and Atrovent nebulizers and Zantac.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION (ON ADMISSION):  Vital signs, T equals
98.2.  Heart rate 68.  Respiratory rate 18.  Blood pressure
115/59.  Oxygen saturation equals 99% on 3 liters nasal
cannula.  General appearance no acute distress.  HEENT mucous
membranes are moist.  Normocephalic, atraumatic.  Pupils are
equal, round and reactive to light and accommodation.
Extraocular movements intact.  Cardiovascular regular rate
and rhythm.  Normal S1 and S2.  Sounds, 2 out of 6 systolic
ejection murmur at the left upper sternal border.  Lungs,
coarse inspiratory breath sounds throughout upper airway
sounds and slight rales at the bases bilaterally.  Abdomen
soft, slight distention, nontender, normoactive bowel sounds.
Extremities rheumatoid arthritis findings of the hands
bilaterally.  No edema, cyanosis or clubbing present.

LABORATORY DATA:  White blood cell equals 20.9, HCT equals
31.8, platelets 496.  SMA 7 with sodium of 135, potassium
4.1, chloride 94, bicarb 34, BUN 16, creatinine .6, glucose
181, calcium 8.3, phos 4.1, magnesium 2.1.  TSH .06, free T4
1.1, Legionella antigen negative, INR 1.1, PT 12.6, PTT 27.7.
Chest x-ray on [**2181-1-12**] was diffuse reticulonodular opacities
becoming confluent and air space disease in the right upper
lobe.  On [**2181-1-15**] significant resolution of ill defined air
space opacities with persistent opacity at the right lung
base.  On [**2181-1-21**] atelectasis at the right lung base with no
consolidation, effusion or pneumothorax.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient is a 47 year-old with asthma
and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation,
aspiration pneumonia status post extubation in the Operating
Room one day prior to transfer to the Medical Service, in stable
respiratory status.  While in the hospital the patient was
continued on her steroid taper for asthma/chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease exacerbation.  She was treated with a fourteen
day course of po Levofloxacin and intravenous Clindamycin for
aspiration pneumonia.  A neck airway CT was obtained, which
revealed severe tracheomalacia near clasp of the trachea and
bronchomalacia as well as multifocal ground glass lung opacities,
small bilateral pleural effusions and bibasilar atelectasis.

The pulmonary team of Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and [**Doctor Last Name **] followed the
patient throughout the hospital stay.  A video swallow study was
obtained, which revealed no evidence of aspiration pneumonia,
but the patient was maintained on a nasogastric tube with tube
feeds during hospital stay for fear of loss of airway or
aspiration. A bronchoscopy was attempted, which revealed
supraglottic edema with tissue redundancy, which was thought to
be secondary to gastroesophageal reflux disease.  The patient
then had a pH probe placed without manometry (which she refused),
which revealed evidence of reflux disease.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] of
ENT evaluated the patient.  A video probe was done, which
revealed swelling of the glottic area.  It was decided that no
esophagogastroduodenoscopy or bronchoscopy would be performed
until the upper airway was cleared.  The patient will wait for
two to three weeks for the swelling to decrease in the glottic
area.  A high dose proton pump inhibitor of Prilosec at 40 mg po
b.i.d. was prescribed to the patient prior to discharge.  While
in the hospital the patient was maintained on intravenous Zantac.

The patient will follow up with ENT in the next two to three
weeks as well as with pulmonary and her primary care physician.
[**Name10 (NameIs) **] procedure will be done until her case is reevaluated.  A T
tube tracheostomy as well as a Y stent in her airway was
considered by the pulmonary team while in the hospital,
