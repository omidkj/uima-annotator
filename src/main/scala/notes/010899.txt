 Findings:
Patient hasa history of Barrett's esophagus. He is under regular
GI follow-up in [**Hospital1 1474**]. He is asymtpomatic. No known history
of dilation used. Talked to Dr.[**Last Name (STitle) **] and Dr.[**Last Name (STitle) 4901**] and decided
to do limited mid-esophageal TEE views only. The TEE probe met
some resistance at 35cms from lips.
LEFT ATRIUM: Dilated LA. No spontaneous echo contrast or
thrombus in the LA/LAA or the RA/RAA.
RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Normal RA size.
RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.
AORTA: Normal aortic diameter at the sinus level. Focal
calcifications in aortic root. Normal ascending aorta diameter.
Focal calcifications in ascending aorta. Normal aortic arch
diameter. Normal descending aorta diameter.
AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS.
Trace AR.
MITRAL VALVE: Partial mitral leaflet flail. Severe (4+) MR.
TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets with trivial
TR.
PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflet.
No PS. Physiologic PR.
PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.
GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify I was present in compliance with HCFA
regulations. The patient was under general anesthesia throughout
the procedure. The TEE probe was passed with assistance from the
anesthesioology staff using a laryngoscope. No TEE related
complications. The patient appears to be in sinus rhythm. See
Conclusions for post-bypass data The post-bypass study was
performed while the patient was receiving vasoactive infusions
(see Conclusions for listing of medications).
Conclusions
PRE-BYPASS:
The left atrium is dilated. No spontaneous echo contrast or
thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium/left atrial
appendage or the body of the right atrium/right atrial
appendage.
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
There is partial mitral leaflet flail of the P2 with severe
mitrall regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial effusion.


POST-BYPASS: For the post-bypass study, the patient was
receiving vasoactive infusions including epinephrine 0.02
mcg/kg/min and phenylephrine 0.5 mcg/kg/min. A well-seated
mitral annuloplasty ring is seen with normal leaflet motion and
gradients (mean gradient = 3 mmHg). There is no valvular
systolic anterior motion ([**Male First Name (un) **]). Trivial (normal for prosthesis)
mitral regurgitation is seen.
Intact thoracic aorta.
  I certify that I was present for this procedure in compliance
with HCFA regulations.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted for surgical management of his mitral
regurgitation.  He was brought to the operating room on
[**2120-12-20**] where he underwent mitral valve repair including
resection of the P2 segment of the posterior leaflet, as well as
30 mm annuloplasty ring.  For further details, please see
operative report.  Overall the patient tolerated the procedure
well and post-operatively was transferred to the CVICU in stable
condition for further invasive monitoring and recovery.  By POD
1 the patient was extubated, alert and oriented and breathing
comfortably. He required neosynephrine for BP support
transiently.

He was hemodynamically stable on no inotropic or vasopressor
support.  He was noted to alternate his rhythm between MobitzII
block and then an accelerated junctional rhythm.  The high
degree AV block quickly resolved and he remained in a junctional
rhythm. This was well tolerated.  He was transferred to the step
down unit on POD 2.

Chest tubes and pacing wires were discontinued in the usual
fashion, without complication.  The physical therapy service was
consulted for assistance with post-operative strength and
mobility.  The patient was gently diuresed toward his
preoperative weight.  He had episodic low blood pressure and was
volume repleted with normal saline as well as albumin with good
response.  Diuretics were discontinued.  A TTE was done on [**12-23**]
(POD#3) which demonstrated no evidence of tamponade or
pericardial effusion.  He felt well throughout this. His
mobility is severely limited due to his previous strokes. He is
able to walk, albeit slowly, with a walker/cane.  He has been
stable on stairs here with the PT staff, and will be able to
negotiate the stairs at home using railings and going slowly
between floors.

Discharge medications, instructions and followup were discussed
with the patient and his wife prior to discharge.
