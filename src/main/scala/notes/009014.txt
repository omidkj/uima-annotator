History of Present Illness:
History is provided by the patient, his chart, EMS note and the
daughter, [**Name (NI) 24990**], [**Name (NI) 653**] at home (cell [**Telephone/Fax (1) 100539**])
.
HPI: 84yo RH M h/o Parkinson disease diagnosed 13yrs ago and
followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 10442**] with possible [**Last Name (un) 309**] body dementia as well,
HTN, hyperlipidemia BIB EMS after he was found lodged between
the toilet and the bathroom wall today. He had barricaded
himself inside the bathroom and was found with several skin
tears, on his right elbow and right shin, as well as with
multiple left-sided bruises. Per EMS note, on their arrival at
11pm yesterday, they found a "cluttered apartment with a
disheveled" patient. FSG was 110.
.
The patient's daughter reports that the patient has had
decreased use of his right hand for at least several days. Over
this time, the wrist has become contracted. She reports a prior
episode months ago where his left wrist was similarly involved.
He was evaluated at this time by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 10442**], who found L wrist
dystonia. MRI C-spine showed spondylosis at multiple levels and
MRI brain was normal.
.
Over this time period, the daughter feels that the patient's
walking has gotten slightly worse, from a baseline deterioration
over months. He has had a harder time getting up into his
walker. She says that he "slipped" today when she was trying to
get him into a wheelchair from the bed.
.
She has noted no other new complaints. No facial droop or other
weakness. She endorses several chronic problems, including
stuttering, dysarthric, hypophonic speech; drooling; decreased
appetite with requirement for soft foods; frequent falls. She
admits that he misses medications and attributes this to
insufficient help (gets 2hrs of VNA/day). He frequently is
"acting irrational", getting angry or sad all of a sudden and
his room is disorganized and messy. His wife is currently in
rehab.
.
When asked what brought him here, the patient states that he
"couldn't walk one step" and was "unstable" on his feet.
However, he says that this has been an ongoing problem, for
months. He says that he has been veering to the right for
"years" when walking and requires a walker. He feels that his
right arm is weak, but this too, he says has been going on for
months. When pressed about the right wrist posture, he says that
this too has been going on for that time  period. He feels that
his speech is worse today, in that "people cannot understand
what I'm saying" and he feels that it may be more slurred than
usual. This has not had a sudden onset but rather fluctuates
throughout the day, he feels. He complains of generalized
fatigue.
.
He reports blurry vision for one week or more, in both eyes and
all fields of vision. No diplopia. No vertigo. No numbness or
tingling. He feels his legs are stiff and have been so for over
a year, "slowly but surely" getting worse. Review of systems is
otherwise negative.
.
In the ED, he was found to be hypothermic to 93.5 and has been
in a warming blanket. He was given clindamycin 600mg IV x 1 and
vancomycin 1g IV x 1 for cellulitis, as well as 1L NS.

movements, even with a visual cue on the ground. Given his
hypothermia, further efforts to help him stand were deferred.
