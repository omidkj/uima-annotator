Shortness of Breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 74 year old male with a history of pulmonary
fibrosis with home O2 requirement of 2-3L, former smoker with
COPD, who presented on [**2128-11-28**] to [**Hospital6 33**] with
complaints of dyspnea.

The patinet has been followed for the last three years by Dr.
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 84016**]at [**Hospital1 3278**], carying a diagnosis of IPF. He reports
to have been treated for many years for COPD, but describes a
change in his dyspnea in [**2125**]. Of note, in [**2124**] patient had an
oil spill in his basement with significant concrete dust in the
construction requiring hospitalization due to pulmonary
symptoms. He also describes a remote asbesstos exposure when in
the arm. He has been managed by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **], but has never been on
any immunologic therapy. We have no recent CT scan or PFTs
available to us at this time. Over the last year, he has also
been on home O2, and has noted a progessive worsening of
symptoms over the last 6 months. He has noted increasing dyspnea
and a slow escalation of O2 requirment. He was started on a
prednisone taper in [**4-3**], but has not been able to taper off
10mg daily. He is on a series of inhaler regimens given below,
but not currently anticoagulated. It does not seem the patient
has had a lung biopsy.

The patient had an admission to [**Hospital1 34**] in [**10-4**], for which he was
treated with a steroid burst and antibiotics for brochroncitis,
which improved but again gradualy worsended. It appears he was
on an extended course of azythromycin.

The patient noted that his respiratory symptoms worsened since
around the [**Holiday 944**] holiday, with incrasing dyspnea on
excersion, a productive cough with mildly blood tinged sputum.
His symptoms continued to worsen, and he began to notice audible
wheese and a marked decline in his dyspnea. On [**2128-11-28**] the
patients son found him to be hypoxic to the 70s on RA and
activated EMS. The patinet was treated intermittent BIPAP 10/5,
but was never able to maintain adequate oxygen saturations on
less than 50% venti-mask oxygen supplementation. CXR showed now
right middle and lower chest opacities which were felt to most
likely be consisent with airspace disease with possible
superimposed pneumonia. BNP was 517, urine leginlla was
negative, strep pneumoniae antigen were both negative. BCx were
no growth to date. He was treated with solumedrol and
levofloxacin with a pulmonology consultation. The patient was
transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] for further manegment.

[**2128-11-30**] 1:00 am Rapid Respiratory Viral Screen & Culture
      Source: Nasopharyngeal swab.

   Respiratory Viral Culture (Preliminary):

   Respiratory Viral Antigen Screen (Final [**2128-11-30**]):
      Negative for Respiratory Viral Antigen.
      Specimen screened for: Adeno, Parainfluenza 1, 2, 3,
Influenza A, B,
      and RSV by immunofluorescence.
      Refer to respiratory viral culture for further
information.

IMPRESSION:
1. No pulmonary embolism.
2. Moderate progression of diffuse interstitial abnormality,
predominantly
subpleural reticulation and fibrosis. Honeycombing is new from
previous exam.
3. Diffuse ground-glass opacity superimposed on background
interstitial
changes. Findings are concerning for acute pulmonary edema, and
could be due to cardiogenic, or non-cardiogenic causes.
Differential includes acute drug reaction, and ARDS. Pneumonitis
secondary to infectious causes, such as PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] also possible.
4. Mediastinal lymphadenopathy is consistent with reported
history of IPF.


Brief Hospital Course:
The patient is a 74 year old male with a history of IPF, COPD,
tobacco use who presents with hypoxia, tranfered for further.
mangement.

# Hypoxia: Most likely etiology of patient's hypoxia and dyspnea
is worsening of his underlying pulmonary fibrosis.  He was
initially treated with antibiotics and steroids without any
improvement.  He had a CT chest which showed worsening of his
underlying disease.  His micro data did not show any new
microorganism.  His viral respiratory panel was also negative.

He was maintained on a non-rebreather mask at 15L/min and nasal
cannula at 10L/min.  He was evaluated by palliative care, and
after much discussion with the patient and family, he was made
DNR/DNI and CMO with palliative care/hospice set up at home.  He
will be discharged with morphine solution and oxygen for home
therapy. His other medications will be discontinued.
