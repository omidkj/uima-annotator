History of Present Illness:
This is a 76 yo female w/ PMH of severe AS, MR secondary to
rheumatic heart disease presenting with progressive dyspnea on
exertion much worse since Monday. Pt. started noticing chest
discomfort which she is unable to characterize, tingling down
both arms and feeling of racing heart a/w dyspnea while walking
short distances on monday. These symptoms lasted about 5 minutes
and resolved after sitting down to rest. Pt. noticed these
symptoms came on this morning around 7:30 at rest and did not
resolve until around noon. These symptoms were not a/w
diaphoresis or nausea. Pt. had a minor heart attack while
hospitalized for elective knee surgery, she states that it did
not feel like these symptoms, she did not feel pain at that
time, she just had a sensation of not being able to get
comfortable in bed. Pt. also complains of a feeling of the room
spinning as she went to sleep last night, there was only one
episode of this. Pt. denies lightheadedness/syncope. Denies

baseline. She currently denies shortness of breath and chest
discomfort. She was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] under the cardiology
service.

[**2159-8-1**] EKG: Atrial fibrillation, mean ventricular rate 86. Left
bundle-branch block.
[**2159-8-1**] CXR: Since the prior study, the degree of pulmonary
vascular congestion and increased interstitial markings has
increased. There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion. Severe
cardiomegaly persists.
[**2159-8-2**] ECHO:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is
moderately dilated. There is moderate global left ventricular
hypokinesis (LVEF = 35 %) (Quantitative biplane EF 41%).
Transmitral Doppler and tissue velocity imaging are consistent
with Grade III/IV (severe) LV diastolic dysfunction. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic arch is mildly
dilated. There are three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve
leaflets are moderately thickened. There is severe aortic valve
stenosis (area <0.8cm2). Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is mild
valvular mitral stenosis (area 1.5-2.0cm2). Moderate (2+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is a trivial/physiologic
pericardial effusion.
[**2159-8-3**] Cardiac Cath:
1. Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system
revealed
no angiographically apparent obstructive coronary disease.
2. Resting hemodynamics recorded during AF with a ventricular
rate of
90, demonstrated elevated left and right sided filling pressures
(mean
PCW 29 mmHg, RVSP 68 mmHg, RVEDP 12mmHg). There was moderately
severe
pulmonary hypertension (PA s/d/m = 66/30/47 mmHg). The
calculated
cardiac index was 2.6 l/min/m2. The catheter was not advanced to
the LV
to assess transaortic gradients or LV pressures as the main
purpose of
this limited study was to assess her coronary anatomy.
3. Left ventriculography was not performed.
[**2159-8-4**] Chest CT Scan:
1. Dense aortic valve and aortic root calcifications. Mild
calcifications
involving ascending aorta, and aortic arch. Mitral valve
calcifications.
2. 10-mm nodule in the left lower lobe, concerning for
malignancy. If no
prior studies are available for comparison, FDG - PET/CT can be
performed to further evaluate this nodule.
3. Diffuse predominantly perihilar ground-glass opacity, likely
reflecting
presence of congestive failure in the setting of cardiomegaly.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 45777**] was admitted under cardiology and started on a
Lasix drip for worsening heart failure. She ruled out for
myocardial infarction. She underwent right and left heart
catheterization which found minimal coronary artery disease and
revealed moderate pulmonary hypertension and moderate
biventricular diastolic dysfunction. Given the above findings,
cardiac surgery was consulted and further evaluation was
performed. Workup was notable for a one centimeter left lower
lobe non-calcified pulmonary nodule, concerning for malignancy.
This pulmonary nodule will be further evaluated as an outpatient
following surgery. Preoperative evaluation was otherwise
unremarkable and she was cleared for surgery. On [**8-7**],
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 914**] performed aortic and mitral valve replacments. For
surgical details, please see seperate dictated operative note.
She was transferred to the intensive for further hemodynamic
monitoring.  Amiodarone was started for ventricular tachycardia
post op which she converted after it was bolused. POD 1 she was
extubated with out complications and weaned from pressors.  She
continued to progress and was transferred to the floor POD 2.
Physical therapy worked with her on strength and mobility.  She
was transfused POD 4 for decreased hematocrit with no
complications.  She was ready to transfer to rehab on POD 5.
