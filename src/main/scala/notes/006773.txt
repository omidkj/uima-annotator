History of Present Illness:
73 yo M w/ a PMH of dilated cardiomyopathy (EF <20%) s/p ICD
placement [**2162**], afib on coumadin, HTN, CRI (baseline Cr 2.3),
hyperlipidemia and asthma, recently admitted from [**2166-3-11**] to
[**2166-3-20**] for decompensated CHF with Acute on chronic renal
failure. He responded well to Dopamine gtt, Dobutamine gtt and
Lasix boluses.

use of accessory muscles. The lungs were clear to ascultation
bilaterally with normal breath sounds and no adventitial sounds

murmurs, clicks or gallops.
.
The abdominal aorta was not enlarged by palpation. There was
pulsitile hepatomegaly. There was no splenomegaly or tenderness.

The abdomen was soft nontender and mildly distended. The
extremities
had no pallor, cyanosis, or clubbing. There was pitting edema
bilaterally extending to the midshin. There were no abdominal,
femoral or carotid bruits. Inspection and/or palpation of skin
and subcutaneous tissue showed no stasis dermatitis, ulcers,
scars, or xanthomas.
.

CXR:
IMPRESSION:
Improved appearance with less right pleural fluid. No
radiographic evidence of worsening CHF.PM BLOOD Lactate-1.8
.
Echo [**2166-4-4**]:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. The estimated right
atrial pressure is 16-20 mmHg. There is severe symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is severely depressed. [Intrinsic left ventricular
systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of
valvular regurgitation.] The right ventricular free wall is
hypertrophied. The right ventricular cavity is dilated. There is
severe global right ventricular free wall hypokinesis.
[Intrinsic right ventricular systolic function is likely more
depressed given the severity of tricuspid regurgitation.] The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The left
ventricular inflow pattern suggests a restrictive filling
abnormality, with elevated left atrial pressure. Moderate [2+]
tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is a trivial/physiologic
pericardial effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2166-3-31**],
left ventricular systolic function appears more depressed.



Brief Hospital Course:
Patient is a 73M with complex cardiac history admitted with
decompensated CHF. He was treated aggressively with diuresis and
pressure support. However, his cardiac function continued to
deteriorate during his stay. He expired on [**2166-4-5**] at 1700.
.
1) Congestive heart failure:
Presented with similar syndrome to the previous admission.  He
was started on Dobutamine and dopamine for improved diuresis and
blood pressure support.  However his blood pressure continued to
be low and phenylephrine/milranone was added.  This did not
improve his BP significantly and dobutamine was restarted.
Throughout that night the pressors were titrated but BPs
remained low until norepinephrine was started.  After this BP
improved as well as urine output. Pt was diuresing well with
small doses of levophed and high doses of dobutamine.  On 0.38
mcg/kg/min levo and 10mcg/kg/min Dobutamine, pt with PAP 50/23,
CO 4.5, CI 2.16, SVR 960. Levophed was weaned off and he was
continued on Dobutamine. Neosynephrine was started in addition
to dobutamine and vasopressin was added. His cardiac function
continued to deteriorate despite aggressive pressor support.
Additionally his urine output declined despite diuretics.
.
2) CAD: Patient with negative biomarkers and EKG changes not
suggestive of ischemia. Enzymes not suggestive of ischemia, and
Troponin T is difficult to interpret in setting of CRI.  Held
his statin in setting of recent myopathy but continued aspirin.
.
3) Rhythm: Patient with known Afib on rate control with
amiodarone. Warfarin initially discontinued as INR elevated.
10mg po and 10mg SQ Vitamin K (on [**3-30**]) and FFP given in the
setting of peri-procedure (Fem line and right heart cath).
Subtherapeutic INR on [**3-31**], heparin drip started, but
discontinued after cath b/o groin bleed and bloody sputum. Pt
was also continued on Amio.
.
4) ARF/CRI: baseline Cr is 2.3, thought to be due to
hypertensive nephropathy. Patient was oliguric.  Renal was
following but did not see an acute indication for dialysis. His
kidney function continued to worsen due to hypoperfusion from
poor forward flow.
.
5) Asthma - continued spiriva and albuterol
.
6) GERD: continued H2blocker and PPI
.
7) FEN: low salt diet, no signs of periphe
