Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1234**]
Chief Complaint:
abdominal pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
1) Open repair of ruptured infrarenal abdominal aneurysm with
tube Dacron graft [**2149-12-5**]
2) Exploratory laparotomy, washout of abdomen, abdominal closure
and placement of the gastrojejunostomy tube.
3) Pacemaker ([**Company 1543**] SIGMA SSR 303) [**2150-1-2**]


History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 88-year-old male well-known to the service. He
recently underwent an endovascular repair of a type III endoleak
from a stent graft placed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in [**2142**]. Upon
presentation at that time, he complained of R-sided abdominal
and flank pain. His post-operative course was complicated by
delirium to the point of occasional combativeness, and serous
leakage from
his bilateral groin incisions. Cultures from an outside hospital
purportedly grew MRSA and P. aeruginosa.

Today he presented to an outside hospital with complaints of
L-sided abdominal pain. Rather that subjecting this patient with
chronic renal insufficiency to a dye load, the hospital elected
to transfer the patient to [**Hospital1 18**] for further work-up.

The patient complains of L-sided/LLQ abdominal pain. He is a
poor historian and is demented and delirious, and given these
constraints in the history-taking, he denies radiation of pain,
nausea, emesis, fever and chills.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted on [**2149-12-5**] with a ruptured abdominal
aortic aneurysm. This was demonstrated on a CT scan.  At that
time he had an open repair of ruptured infrarenal abdominal
aneurysm with tube Dacron graft.  Please see operative note for
full details.  He did code in the OR multiple times due to
pulmonary embolisms.  EBL was 1200 and he recieved 8 units of
RBC, 3 units of FFP, and 1400 cc of cell [**Doctor Last Name 10105**].  On POD 1, he
was of course intubated.  He was started empirically on Vanco,
Cipro, and Flagyl.  He was on Vasopressin and was
hemodynamically stable.  We weaned him off of Neosynepherine
overnight.  He did recieve 2 units of RBC and 4 units of FFP.
His Hct was stable at 33.  On POD 2, he went into rapid a-fib
and an amiodarone drip was started.  He did recieve 4 more units
of FFP for coagulopathy.  Sedation was changed from propofol to
versed.  His right foot was cool, but pulses were dopplerable.
He was making urine.  On POD 4, he had been weaned off of the
amiodarone drip, but was started on a dilt drip for rate
control. At that time, he had an exploratory laparotomy, washout
of abdomen, abdominal closure and placement of the
gastrojejunostomy tube by general surgery.  Please see operative
note for full details.  A VAC dressing was left on the skin.
His feet were cool and mottled but with pulses.  He was stable
off of pressors.  On POD [**4-23**], his urine output decreased to 625
cc for the previous day.  He was fluid responsive.  His
ventillator was weaned to CPAPA/PS 5/5.  TPN was started.  On
POD [**5-25**], he was still on a diltiazem drip.  Antibiotics were
stopped.  Urine output was 771 and BUN and createnine were up to
66 and 2.4.  His tube feeds were slowly advanced through the
J-tube port at 1/2 strength.  A heparin drip was started because
of the intraoperative PEs.  Aspirin and a statin were started.
On POD [**6-25**], he vomited bile.  Tube feeds were held.  A lasix
drip was started and his UOP increased to 1880 and he was a
liter negative.  His BUn and createnine were 79 and 2.6.  He was
off of all sedation and not waking up.  Diltiazem drip was
weaned.  A G-J tube check showed free passage of barium through
stomach, duodenum and proximal jejenum through orogastric and
J-tube. A KUB showed mild dilatation of the distal jejunal loops
and relatively slow transit time of the contrast material
administered two hours earlier during an upper GI series.  He
was thought to have an ileus.  On POD [**3-31**], diltaizem was off.
His UOP was 650 and his BUN/createnie was 94/3.1.  A CT of the
head was negative and he still wasn't waking up.  Tube feeds
were advanced to goal, although NG tube output was 2100.  The
nephrology service was consulted.  He was felt to have prerenal
azotemia and underlying ATN.  We gave him albumin and he was
stable.  On POD [**9-28**], he got 2 units of RBC for blood loss
anemia (hct 24).  His WBC was 18 and he was afebrile.  A HD line
was placed byt he ICU team.  CVVHD was started the following
day.  On POD [**10-30**], his WBC was 23.  Cultures were sent and he
grew out a milti-drug resistent Klebsiella from his sputum and
from his blood.  A radial A-line was placed and his PICC was
discontinued.  The tip later grew Klebsiella.  His central line
was changed over a wire and the tip was subsequently positive
for Klebsiella.  On POD [**11-30**], he was on Cipro.  He was afebrile,
but his WBC was 23.  BUN and cre was 81/2.5 and urine output was
over 1000.  His NG tube did put out 2700 and it looked like tube
feeds.  A CT of the torso was performed and we found a splenic
infarct, bilateral pleural effusions, anasarca, and ileus.  On
POD 13/9, he was on Vanco, Meropenem, Fluconazole, and Cipro.  A
new CVVHD line was placed due to the fear of line sepsis.  NG
tube put out 2800 and UOP was 400, but he was negative 1 liter
on CVVHD.  Tube feeds were held, TPN was started.  On POD 14/10,
he was extubated.  He was able to move all 4 extremities and
pssibly follow commands.  He was not gettin any sedation.  His
WBC was down to 18, now on vanco, meropenem, and flagyl.  On POD
15/11, he was only on meropenem because the cultures were back.
This was to be a 6 week course.  He was doing well from a
respiratory standpoint.  On POD 16/12, his urine output was 1300
and he was off CVVHD.  His WBC was 18 and his BUN/cre was
43/1.8.  Tube feeds were slowly advanced.  On POD 17/13, he
still had multiple dilated loops of bowel on KUB.  PT began
working with him.  A swallow evaluation was done and he was to
be kept NPO.  On
