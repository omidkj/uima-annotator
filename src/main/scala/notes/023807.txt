History of Present Illness:
This is a 67 yo man admitted to [**Hospital6 **] [**2192-2-8**]
after an acute  anterior STEMI. Emergent catheterization  showed
totally occluded LAD.Ballooning and stent was attempted which
resulted in poor TIMI flow.Pt developed cardiogenic shock  and
pulmonary edema necessitating placement of intraaortic balloon
pump and  prolongued use of Mechanical Ventilation.
.
ECHO showed an EF of 35 % c akinetic midventricle to apex,
Pt developed VAP c Pseudomonas in sputum (received a full course
of Cefepime and Vanc), and persistent pleural effusions which
were  consistenly  a transudate .
.
Pt did not tolerate multiple CPAP trials d/2 progressive CHF and
altered mental status,  and had a tracheostomy on [**2191-3-7**].
.
Pt has been having  hemoptysis over the last 7 days at OSH .He
was transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] today for rigid bronchoscopy and
electrocoagulation. Today in PACU there was no proxy to sign
consent for the procedure .Psychiatric evaluation at OSH has
been unable to determine wheher pt is consentable d/2 language
barriers.(Pt is vietnamese in origin ). After all this
considerations , procedure was cancelled until a proxy was made
available.
It was decided to transfer the pt back to OSH .There were some
technical difficulties while connecting  pt to the ventilator
during transportation .Pt became hypoxic and cyanotic. Per nurse
report there was transiently no pulse.Soon after restarting MV ,
pt's oxygenation rapidly improved   and  vital sign went back to
baseline.

Echo -
1.The left atrium is mildly dilated.
2.Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity  size is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is severely  depressed. [Intrinsic left
ventricular systolic function is likely more  depressed given
the severity of valvular regurgitation.] Resting regional wall
motion abnormalities include anterior, septal, apical and apical
and mid  inferolateral akinesis.
3.Right ventricular chamber size is normal.
4.The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. Moderate
to severe (3+)
aortic regurgitation is seen.
5.The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate (2+)
mitral
regurgitation is seen.
6.Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
7.There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
8.There is no pericardial effusion.


Brief Hospital Course:
A/P  Pt is a 68 yom with PMH of recent massive anterior STEMI
s/p failed revascularization and secondary CHF on chronic [**Hospital **]
transferred from [**Hospital1 **] for IP procedure who was unable to
consent and in process of retransport became cyanotic.  Patient
was transferred to the MICU.  He underwent a rigid bronch eval
the following day which revealed edema but no clear bleeding.
.
#Respiratory failure: Patient was continued on mechanincal
ventilation.  Initially on Assist control but soon changed over
to pressure support.  Given bronch findings assessement was that
he had congestive heart failure and his hypoxia and hemoptysis
were secondary to CHF.  He was diuresised during the
hospitilization with lasix at one time requiring lasix gtt.  He
also underwent R sided thoracentesis (removal ~1200 cc serous
fluid) which revealed a transudate.  With diuresis his
hemoptysis and secretions improved.
.
# Ischemia: Has h/o of AMI and on admission had perisistent ST
elevations in anterolateral leads.  Compared to previous
tracings he did not have any new changes.  Plavix was held given
hemoptysis (also unclear if the stent at [**Hospital1 2177**] was successful as
there was very little flow post stenting per reports).  Aspirin,
statin and BB were continued.  He had reports of bronchospasm at
OSH on BB, however he tolerated that fine here.
.
## CHF: Echo was done here and shoed EF of 35%, he needed
aggressive diuresis.  He was on lasix gtt and was transitioned
over to PO lasix.  On discharge he was requiring 80mg lasix po
bid to remain euvolemic to slightly negative.  He was also
started on Hydral/IMdur for afterload reduction.  ACEI was
deffered given his history of angioedema.  Also [**First Name9 (NamePattern2) 66539**] [**Male First Name (un) **]
digoxin.
.
## A. fib - Pt had an episode of a. fib with RVR to 120s.  He
was started on Amiodarone IV and he coverted to sinus rhythm.
OOn day of dishcarge he remained in sinus.  He should be on
amiodarone 400mg [**Hospital1 **] for 1 week followed by 2 weeks on 400 mg
once day followed by a maintance dose of 400mg daily.  He was
also continued on digoxin 0.125mg everyother day.  Pt should
have periodic Electrocardiograms done to monitor qT interval.
He is on several antipshycoitics and amiodarone which [**Doctor Last Name **]
prolong qT interval.  He should have cardiology appointment to
monitor amiodarone dosing.
.
#Anemia - He required transfusions intermittently for goal hct
28.
.
#Psychiatric - Pt's MS waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] per psych notes has had
delirium.  His psych meds were continued and required restraints
for episodic agitiation.
.
# Nutrition: Pt has PEG tube and maintained on enteral feeding
via peg.
