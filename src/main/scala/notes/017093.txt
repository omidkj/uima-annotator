CHEST (PORTABLE AP)

Reason: r/o ptx s/p ct's removed

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
58 year old woman with
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
r/o ptx s/p ct's removed
HISTORY: Chest tube removal to evaluate for pneumothorax.

FINDINGS: In comparison with study of [**3-27**], all of the tubes
have been removed. No evidence of pneumothorax. The left
hemidiaphragm is again not well seen and the possibility of
retrocardiac atelectasis, effusion, and even consolidation
cannot be excluded. Mild atelectatic changes persist at the
right base.

Findings
LEFT ATRIUM: Marked LA enlargement. No thrombus in the LAA.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Normal RA size. PFO is present.
Left-to-right shunt across the interatrial septum at rest.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thickness and cavity size. Normal
regional LV systolic function. Overall normal LVEF (>55%).
[Intrinsic LV systolic function likely depressed given the
severity of valvular regurgitation.]

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTA: Normal aortic diameter at the sinus level. Normal aortic
arch diameter. No atheroma in aortic arch. Normal descending
aorta diameter. Simple atheroma in descending aorta.

AORTIC VALVE: Normal aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS. No AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Myxomatous mitral valve leaflets. Partial mitral
leaflet flail. [**Month/Day (2) **] MR jet. Severe (4+) MR. Uninterpretable
LV inflow pattern due to MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets with trivial
TR.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflets
with physiologic PR. No PR.

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify I was present in compliance with HCFA
regulations. The patient was under general anesthesia throughout
the procedure. No TEE related complications.
Conclusions
Pre-Bypass: The left atrium is markedly dilated. No thrombus is
seen in the left atrial appendage. A patent foramen ovale is
present. A left-to-right shunt across the interatrial septum is
seen at rest. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size
are normal. Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more
depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.] Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There
are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets
are myxomatous. There is partial mitral leaflet flail. An
[**Month/Day (2) 34486**], posteriorly directed jet of Severe (4+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial effusion.

Post bypass: Preserved biventricular function. LVEF >55%. A
mechanical mitral valve prosthesis is seen insitu with normal
bilateral washing jets. Peak gradient 6, mean 4-5 mm Hg. Aortic
contours intact. Remaining exam is unchanged. All findings
discussed with surgeon at the time of the exam.


Brief Hospital Course:
She was taken to the operating room on [**3-27**] where she underwent
an MVR with a mechanical valve. She was transferred to the ICU
in stable condition on neo and propofol. She was extubated later
that day. She was started on coumadin for her mechanical valve.
She was transferred to the floor on POD #1. Her wires and chest
tubes were pulled without incident. She did well postoperatively
and awaited therapeutic INR. She was ready for discharge home on
POD 5. Spoke to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 40318**] office who has agreed to manage her
coumadin.
