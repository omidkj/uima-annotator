Admission Date:  [**2116-4-28**]     Discharge Date:  [**2116-4-30**]

Date of Birth:   [**2082-3-28**]     Sex:  F

Service:  MEDICAL INTENSIVE CARE UNIT

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Fatigue, shortness of breath, fever with
left lower extremity pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Patient is a 34-year-old
morbidly obese female with a past medical history significant
for asthma (requiring intubation and tracheostomy in [**2114**]),
and obstructive-sleep apnea requiring intermittent mechanical
ventilation, who was recently admitted to [**Hospital1 346**] Medical Intensive Care Unit ([**4-11**]
through [**4-13**]) for fever, chills, and headache.  At that
time, the patient was treated empirically for bacterial
meningitis (a lumbar puncture could not be performed
secondary to body habitus) with a two week course of
ceftriaxone and Vancomycin.  Patient also completed a 10 day
course of Augmentin for left lower extremity cellulitis.  The
last dose of IV antibiotics was on [**4-20**] and last dose
of oral antibiotics was on [**4-26**].

Since discharge, the patient's headache has improved without
evidence of photophobia or neck stiffness.  However, the
patient complains of increasing left lower extremity pain and
swelling of several day duration associated with a low-grade
fever and progressive fatigue.  The patient also complains of
cough productive of yellow-green sputum and increasing
dyspnea on exertion to several yards.

The patient was seen by her primary care physician on [**4-27**] and prescribed a 10 day course of dicloxacillin for
recurrent left lower extremity cellulitis.  The morning of
admission, the patient awoke with worsening left lower
extremity pain and shortness of breath, and presented to the
Emergency Department.

In the Emergency Department, the patient was found with a
temperature of 99.6, heart rate 100, blood pressure 144/50,
respiratory rate 18, oxygen saturation 91% on room air, 100%
on 3 liters.  The patient was pancultured with sputum, urine,
and blood cultures.  Was admitted for further workup.  Of
note, the patient's tracheostomy cuff had recently cracked,
and requires replacement for adequate ventilation.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  The patient denies dysuria, abdominal
pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, as well as headache.  The
patient is normally ambulatory for her size at baseline with
mild dyspnea on exertion.  The patient reports bilateral
lower extremity edema previously treated with oral Lasix
(recently held since [**Month (only) 958**] 15TG).

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Obstructive-sleep apnea requiring assist-control
ventilation while asleep.
2. History of asthma status post intubation in [**2114-3-29**] with failure to wean and tracheostomy placement in
[**2114-3-1**].  The patient was weaned from the ventilator
on [**2114-4-29**], and has been maintained on intermittent assist
control ventilation for obstructive-sleep apnea.
3. Depression.
4. Morbid obesity.
5. Anxiety.
6. Anemia of chronic disease with a baseline hematocrit of
26-27.

ALLERGIES:  Percocet and Vicodin with a reaction of rash.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1. Fluticasone 110 mcg two puffs [**Hospital1 **].
2. Salmeterol two puffs [**Hospital1 **].
3. Albuterol 1-2 puffs q6h prn.
4. Venlafaxine 75 mg po bid.
5. Ambien 5 mg po q hs.
6. Dicloxacillin - not taken since visit on with primary care
physician on [**4-27**].

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives alone at elderly
handicapped apartment building, and denies tobacco, alcohol,
as well as drug use.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 100.2, blood pressure
150/30, respiratory rate 28, heart rate 120, oxygen
saturation 98% on 3 liters.  Weight 249.2 kg.  In general,
the patient is a morbidly obese female in no acute distress.
HEENT examination:  Normocephalic, atraumatic, anicteric
sclerae.  Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light and
accommodation.  Clear oropharynx, moist mucous membranes.  No
oral thrush.  Neck examination is supple, no lymphadenopathy,
with trache in place.  Pulmonary examination:  Clear to
auscultation bilaterally, posteriorly with no wheezes, rales,
or rhonchi.  Cardiovascular examination:  Regular, rate, and
rhythm with a 2/6 systolic murmur at the left upper sternal
border, no S3, S4.  Abdominal examination:  Soft, nontender,
nondistended, obese with normoactive bowel sounds.
Extremities:  3+ lower extremity edema left greater than
right with 1+ dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses.
Left lower extremity with circumferential erythema from the
ankle to [**3-31**] way up the shin (distal to the knee) with
increased warmth and mild tenderness to palpation, as well as
brawny skin changes with induration.  There is a band of [**3-31**]
cm area superior to the left ankle which is dark red,
indurated, with small eschar without pus.  Negative [**Last Name (un) 5813**]
sign and no palpable cords.

LABORATORIES AND STUDIES ON ADMISSION:  Complete blood count
with a white blood cell count of 7.6, hematocrit 27.5, and
platelets of 503 with a MCV of 77 and white blood cell
differential of 77% polys, 16% lymphocytes, and 5% monocytes.
Chem-7 with a sodium of 136, potassium 4.5, chloride 99,
bicarb 26, BUN 8, creatinine 0.6, and glucose of 92.  Coags
with a PT of 13.1, INR of 1.1, and PTT of 27.2.

CHEST X-RAY:  Without evidence of consolidation or effusion
with an appropriately placed tracheostomy.  Prior
transesophageal echocardiogram on [**2114-3-9**]
demonstrating mild left atrial dilatation, moderate right
atrial dilatation, normal left ventricular size and function,
and hypertrophied right ventricular free wall with overall
right ventricular dilatation, moderate pulmonary
hypertension, and no valvular abnormalities.

Left lower extremity ultrasound on [**4-15**] without
evidence of deep venous thrombosis.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the Medical
Intensive Care Unit secondary to required overnight
mechanical ventilation for obstructive-sleep apnea.  The
patient was found on admission with a low grade fever with
clinical evidence of persistent left lower extremity
cellulitis.  The cellulitis was felt to be a continuation of
prior cellulitis on inadequate prior antibiotic course and
potentially inadequate dose.

The patient was started on oxacillin 3 grams IV q6h (dosed by
weight) and defervesced with significant symptomatic
improvement over 24 hours.  The patient also demonstrated
modest progression of the border of erythema in the left
lower extremity.

The patient's tracheostomy cuff was replaced on hospital day
#1 without complication.  The patient demonstrated improved
ventilation mechanics overnight with a report in significant
improvement in symptoms of malaise and dyspnea.  The patient
was maintained overnight on assist control ventilation with a
tidal volume of 700, PEEP of 5, respiratory rate 12, and FIO2
of 40%.

Patient has a known history of anemia of chronic disease with
a baseline hematocrit of 25-27.  On admission, the patient's
hematocrit was 27 (at baseline), however, on hospital day #1,
the patient's hematocrit dropped to 22 (24 on repeat) for
unclear reasons.  Although the patient has intermittent
hemorrhoidal bleeding, there was no evidence of significant
bleeding with a persistently guaiac-negative stool.  The
patient also is without evidence of hematuria or
menstruation.  The patient does report a history of heavy
menstruation, however, has not menstruated for approximately
30 days.

Given the absence of symptoms and significant physiologic
response to the anemia, without known coronary artery
disease, a blood transfusion was not given, and the patient
was instructed to followup with her primary care physician in
one week postdischarge.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Good, ambulating without difficulty
with improved symptoms of fatigue and dyspnea on exertion,
and clinically responding left lower extremity cellulitis.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1. Left lower extremity cellulitis.
2. Anemia of chronic disease.
3. Obstructive-sleep apnea on an intermittent assist control
ventilation.
