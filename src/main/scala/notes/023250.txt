[**2189-11-28**] 8:20 pm BLOOD CULTURE

   Blood Culture, Routine (Preliminary):
      ENTEROCOCCUS SP..

   Aerobic Bottle Gram Stain (Final [**2189-11-30**]):
      REPORTED BY PHONE TO [**Doctor Last Name **] @2032 ON [**2189-11-29**].
      GRAM POSITIVE COCCUS(COCCI).    IN PAIRS AND CHAINS.

   Anaerobic Bottle Gram Stain (Final [**2189-11-30**]):
      REPORTED BY PHONE TO [**Doctor Last Name **] [**Female First Name (un) 21956**] @2032 ON [**2189-11-29**].
      GRAM POSITIVE COCCUS(COCCI).    IN PAIRS AND CHAINS.
ECRP:
Findings:
Esophagus: Limited exam of the esophagus was normal
Contents: Scar tissue and small amout of fresh red blood was
seen in the incisura of the stomach. This could not be
completely washed off. No ulcers were noted.
Duodenum: Limited exam of the duodenum was normal
Major Papilla: A single periampullary diverticulum with small
opening was found at the major papilla.  The ampulla was
otherwise normal.  No pus was noted.
Cannulation:  Cannulation of the biliary duct was successful and
deep with a sphincterotome using a free-hand technique. Contrast
medium was injected resulting in partial opacification.
.
Biliary Tree: Many stones ranging in size from 2mm to 8mm that
were causing partial obstruction were seen at the lower third of
the common bile duct. There was post-obstructive dilation to 1.5
cm.
Given suspicion for cholangitis, detailed cholangiogram was not
obtained. No obvious strictures were noted.
.
Procedures: A 7 cm by 10 fr Cotton-[**Doctor Last Name **] biliary stent was
placed successfully using a Oasis system stent introducer kit.
.
Impression: Periampullary diverticulum, Stones at the lower
third of the common bile duct with post-obstructive biliary
dilation - a biliary stent was placed.

Conclusions
The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right atrium is
markedly dilated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is moderately dilated.
There is mild to moderate regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction with focal hypo to akinesis of the basal to mid
inferior and inferolateral walls. The distal apex is not well
visualized.. The remaining segments contract normally (LVEF =
35-40 %). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus
level. The ascending aorta is moderately dilated. The aortic
arch is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately
thickened. No mass or vegetation is seen on the aortic valve.
There is moderate aortic valve stenosis (area 1.0 cm2). Moderate
(2+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
moderately thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. There
is a very small mobile echogenic mass on the anterior leaflet of
the mitral valve (0.3 x 0.4 cm) which is may represent a torn
chordal structure; however, cannot fully exclude small mitral
valve vegetation (clips 4, 17 ). No mass or vegetation is seen
on the mitral valve. There is moderate thickening of the mitral
valve chordae. An eccentric, posteriorly directed jet of
moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate [2+] tricuspid
regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. The pulmonic valve leaflets are
thickened.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2188-5-30**], a
very small echogenic mass is seen on the anterior leaflet of the
mitral valve which may represent a torn chordal structure;
however, cannot exclude small vegetation with certainty. If
clinically indicated, a TEE may better assess for valvular
vegetations given diffuse valvular thickening. Overall left
ventricular function appears more vigorous. Estimated pulmonary
artery systolic pressures are slightly lower. There is an
increased velocity across the aortic valve consistent with
moderate aortic stenosis. Right ventricular cavity size and
systolic function now appear normal.

ASCENDING CHOLANGITIS: ERCP on [**11-28**] removed several stones and a
stent was placed.  He became hypotensi
