Attending:[**Name8 (MD) 100613**]
CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Lightheadedness, melena, episode of
coffee-grounds emesis.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 83-year-old male with
a history of coronary artery disease, peptic ulcer disease,
congestive heart failure, and diabetes mellitus who presents
with two weeks of melena and lightheadedness.

Five days prior to admission, the patient had an episode of
coffee-grounds emesis.  He also recalls some dyspnea on

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Review of systems reveals no chest pain,
abdominal pain, dysuria, fever, chills, or sweats.  He
recalls a fall without loss of consciousness prior to the
melena.  He has had stress from his daughter's death back in
[**2133-3-25**].  He admits to taking an aspirin per day for the
past 20 years.  The patient quit smoking 28 years ago with a
+20-pack-year history and quit drinking 38 years ago.

In the Emergency Department, the patient's fingerstick blood
sugar levels were around the 400s, so he was given 8 units of
insulin subcutaneously, 6 units of insulin intravenously, and
put on a 2-units per hour insulin drip.  He was also given
normal saline.  An order was placed for packed red blood
cells because his hematocrit was 18, and Gastroenterology was
contact[**Name (NI) **].  Though he was guaiac-positive, the gastric lavage
revealed no blood or clots.

While in the Emergency Department, he had electrocardiogram
changes with ST depressions in leads I, aVL, V4, V5, and V6.
Therefore, the patient was given an aspirin.

was 121/75, respiratory rate was 18, oxygen saturation was
92% on room air, temperature was 96.3.  Head, eyes, ears,
nose, and throat revealed pupils were equal, round, and
reactive to light and accommodation.  Extraocular movements
were intact.  Mucous membranes were dry.  The neck was supple
without lymphadenopathy or jugular venous distention.
Cardiovascular examination revealed a regular rate and
rhythm.  Normal first heart sound and second heart sound.  A
2/6 systolic ejection murmur at the left upper sternal border
without radiation.  Chest revealed crackles at the bases
heard bilaterally.  The abdomen was soft, nontender, and
nondistended, with decreased bowel sounds.  Extremities
revealed no clubbing, cyanosis, or edema were noted.  He felt
somewhat cool.  Dorsalis pedis pulses were 1+ on the right
and 2+ on the left.

PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:  Laboratories upon
admission revealed his white blood cell count was 22.3 (with
77% neutrophils, 3% basophils, 12% lymphocytes, 5% monocytes,
2% eosinophils).  Hemoglobin was 5.9, hematocrit was 18.9,
mean cell volume was 89, platelets were 389.  Sodium was 131,
potassium was 5.1, chloride was 93, bicarbonate was 13, blood
urea nitrogen was 58, creatinine was 1.3, and blood glucose
was 403, anion gap was 25.  PT was 13.3, PTT was 23, INR
was 1.2.  ALT was 13, AST was 24, alkaline phosphatase
was 54, total bilirubin was 0.4.  Creatine kinase was 132.
CK/MB was 10.  CK/MB index was 7.6.  Acetone was negative.
Troponin was 7.6.  Urinalysis showed a glucose of greater
than 1000, was clear.  Arterial blood gas done on 91%
saturation on room air revealed pH was 7.43, PCO2 was 31, PO2
was 95.

RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  Electrocardiogram showed a normal sinus
rhythm with heart rate of 98, normal axis, 2-mm ST
depressions in leads I, aVL, V4, V5, and V6.

A chest x-ray showed bibasilar patchy opacities that may be
consistent with some pulmonary edema.

HOSPITAL COURSE:

1.  GASTROINTESTINAL:  The patient was anemic secondary to a
peptic ulcer bleed or nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug
induced gastritis.  He was given 4 units of packed red blood
cells, and his hematocrit appropriately went from 18.9 to
28.3.  He was given Protonix 40 mg p.o. q.d. for prophylaxis.
His aspirin was withheld due to the bleed.  The patient was
scoped on [**2133-9-4**].

2.  CARDIOVASCULAR:  The patient had a demand ischemia and
lateral infarct, according to cardiac enzymes changes and
electrocardiogram changes.  His infarct was located
laterally; according to the ST depressions that were found in
leads I, aVL, and V4 through V6.  These electrocardiogram
changes remained stable and unchanged throughout the hospital
course.

Over a 24-hour period, his creatine kinase did rise from 132,
peaking at 696, and then declining down to 419.  His CK/MB
was 10 on admission, peaking at 71, and trending down to 27.
His creatine kinase index was 7.6 on admission, peaking
at 12.1, and trending down to a normal value of 6.4.

His cardiologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], did see him in house and
recommended that a beta blocker be added to his medication
regimen.  Metoprolol 25 mg p.o. b.i.d. was added.

With regard to coronary artery disease, the patient's aspirin
was held in light of his gastrointestinal bleed.  With regard
to the hypertension, the patient's blood pressure remained
within the normal systolic range of 90 to 135 over the
hospital course.

As for his congestive heart failure, the patient remained
clinically asymptomatic and was saturating above 90% during
the hospital stay.

3.  RESPIRATORY:  The patient did have a bilateral basilar
opacity on the chest x-ray.  However, he did not have any
respiratory problems clinically.  After his transfusion of
4 units of packed red blood cells, the patient was not given
any additional intravenous fluids that would exacerbate his
congestive heart failure.  It was recommended that he follow
up with a chest x-ray within one week.

4.  HEMATOLOGY:  The patient's anemia resolved with a
transfusion of 4 units of packed red blood cells.  His
hematocrit appropriately bumped from 18.9 to 28.3.

5.  ENDOCRINE:  Since the patient was started on a clear
liquid diet, per Gastroenterology recommendations, he was
restarted on his metformin 850 mg p.o. b.i.d.  His medication
adequately controlled his fingerstick blood sugar levels of
below 100s.

6.  RENAL:  The patient did have a anion gap metabolic
acidosis with a transfusion and
hydration, the patient's acidosis did resolve.  Also, the
hydration also helped resolve his prerenal azotemia because
his creatinine went from 1.7 back to a baseline of 1.3.

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  Condition on discharge was stable.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  Discharge status was to home.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
1.  Protonix 40 mg p.o. q.d.
2.  Metformin 850 mg p.o. b.i.d.
3.  Lipitor 10 mg p.o. q.d.
4.  Lopressor 50 mg p.o. q.d.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Anemia secondary to upper gastrointestinal bleed.
2.  Lateral myocardial infarction due to demand ischemia.
3.  Coronary artery disease.
4.  Hypertension.
5.  Congestive heart failure.
6.  Diabetes mellitus.
7.  Prerenal azotemia.

DISCHARGE FOLLOWUP:  The patient was to follow up with his
primary care provider (Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 803**] [**Last Na
