HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 47-year-old
male with chronic hepatitis C, alcohol abuse, and cirrhosis.
After a few weeks of heavy drinking, he was found unconscious
on the beach vomiting large amounts of bright red blood.  He
was admitted to [**Hospital 3320**] Hospital, where he underwent an EGD
the distal esophagus.  Bleeding initially was stopped, but
resumed again at which time 1 liter of blood was removed via
nasogastric tube.

At the outside hospital, he received 6 units of pack red
blood cells, 5 units of fresh-frozen plasma, and 6 units of
platelets, and is transferred to [**Hospital1 **]
outside hospital for airway protection.  He arrives at [**Hospital3 **] intubated.  Condition is stable.

TIPS was attempted on the night of admission, on [**2121-9-30**] for
technical reasons.  Over that night, the patient received an
additional 8 units of packed red blood cells, 6 units of
fresh-frozen plasma, and 1 unit of platelets, as well as put
on an octreotide drip and received electrolyte replacement.
This was successfully completed on [**2121-8-31**] and the patient
was transferred to the MICU.

Over the next days, the patient's bleeding slowly resolved.
EGD was repeated with no new bleeding sources and he was
bronchoscoped secondary to blood removed from ET tube.  This
revealed clots thought to be secondary to aspiration during
primary bleeding event.  He was started on Levaquin and
Flagyl for treatment of aspiration pneumonia as well as
spontaneous bacterial peritonitis prophylaxis.

While he was going through the past procedure, Interventional
Radiology tapped his ascites, but no studies were done.
Ultrasound currently done for possible diagnostic
paracentesis shows little fluid in the abdomen.  Patient was
extubated on [**2121-9-4**] without event. He only had trace to mild
ascites on ultrasound

On [**2121-9-5**] he reported hallucinations of mice and babies.
These resolved with 1 mg of Haldol.  This is felt to be
alcoholic withdrawal hallucinosis.  He was not tachycardic or
febrile at the time there were no seizures.  He was stable
and taking medications, and food, liquids po on [**2121-10-7**] and
was transferred out of the unit on to the floor.

Physical examination on admission to the hospital on [**9-29**]:
Temperature 100.4 F, 94, blood pressure 113/54.  HCV:
750/14/40% 5 mm PEEP.  HEEN:  Sclerae are anicteric.  Patient
was intubated with a nasogastric tube, ET tube to 28 cm,
Foley, rectal tube.  Right IJ line in place.  Neck showed
right IJ line, no palpable hematoma.  Lungs:  Coarse lung
sounds bilaterally.  Decreased sound at right lung base.
Heart:  Regular, rate, and rhythm, no murmur appreciated at
this time.  Extremities were warm with distal pulses positive
+1.  Neurologic examination was sedated.

Laboratories on admission from an outside hospital:  An
albumin of 2.2, PT of 20, INR 1.9, bilirubin 3.4, alk 104,
AST 116, ALT 283, amylase 81.  White blood cells 8,
hematocrit 27.5, platelets 54,000.  Sodium 140, potassium
3.6, chloride 105, CO2 29, BUN 22, creatinine 0.8, glucose
168.  CO is 6.7, magnesium 1.5, PO 4.16.

Soon after hospitalization, laboratories were repeated which
was found that his hematocrit had dropped to 22.6 prompting
retransfusion.

HOSPITAL COURSE AFTER REACHING THE FLOOR:  On acceptance to
the General Medicine Floor, the patient's hematocrit was 31.0
and platelets of 72,000, both are within the normal range for
this patient's baseline.  His coagulation studies have not
changed dramatically with an INR of 2.0.  Electrolytes were
unremarkable.  Albumin is consistently low at 2.1.  This
patient did have persistently mild elevations of amylase and
lipase.  These were felt to be from fluid contraction leading
to mild leak of pancreatic enzymes.  He was found to be
Clostridium difficile negative.

Chest x-ray repeated for low-grade fevers was found to be
clear.  The patient's IJ line on inspection was read as
erythematous and warm compared to contralateral neck.  IJ
line was removed and a second peripheral IV was placed.
After removal of the IJ catheter, fevers resolved
spontaneously.  The patient was continued on Levo/Flagyl for
the remainder of his course for prevention of aspiration
pneumonia.  These medications were stopped on [**2121-10-9**].

Patient remained noncephalopathic.  Did not have any
complications following TIPS procedure.  He did not have any
rebleed.

For his lower extremitye edema, this patient was placed on 25
mg qd of aldactone and  as well as
lactulose titrated to [**1-29**] loose stools per day to prevent
encephalopathy. The patient was not started on beta blockers for
secondary prophylaxis of variceal bleed due to persistently low
blood pressure and low heart rate dipping into the 40s and
occasionally high 30s at night during sleep which is
asymptomatic.

Cardiac:  The systolic ejection murmur and was also noted to
have a brief run of supraventricular tachycardia on Tele the
night of [**10-6**].  He had a cardiac echocardiogram done on
[**10-7**] which showed moderate dilation with normal ejection
fraction.  There are no valvular abnormalities.

Renal function remained stable throughout hospitalization.
After TIPS procedure, hematocrit and white blood cell count
remained stable.  Electrolytes were repleted throughout
hospitalization, most prominently potassium and magnesium
needed repletion.

Neuropsych:  Except for that single episode of
hallucinations, this patient showed no signs of alcohol
withdrawal.  He was counseled extensively by Social Work, the
medical team and his family on the need to abstain from
alcohol from here on.  He has agreed to be transferred to an
alcohol rehab program after discharge.

The patient is discharged in good condition.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1. Alcohol abuse.
2. Hepatitis C.
3. Cirrhosis.
4. Variceal bleed requiring TIPS placement.
5. Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
6. Thrombocytopenia.
7. Anemia.
8. splenomegaly

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1. Spironolactone 25 mg po q day
2. Lactulose 30 mg po tid titrate to [**1-29**] loose stools per
day.
4. Endoprazole 40 mg po q day.
5. Multivitamins one po q day.

He is recommended to keep on a low-salt diet.  He will follow
up with his hepatologist next month.
