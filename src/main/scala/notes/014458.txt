Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Benadryl

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1936**]
Chief Complaint:
anemia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation
Pressors (medications to support blood pressure)
Thoracentesis ([**5-23**])


History of Present Illness:
84 yo M h/o systolic CHF (EF 20-25% in [**3-20**]), HTN, afib on
warfarin, CKD (baseline Cr 2.1), DM2, and L MCA CVA who
presented with anemia from nursing home. He was recently d/c'ed
from [**Hospital1 18**] after an admission [**Date range (1) 12479**] for generalized
weakness attributed to CHF exacerbation. Today, on routine lab
check his Hct was 22 from baseline of low 30s, and Cr 3.7 from
baseline 2.1. There was reportedly no evidence of acute bleeding
at his NH. Pt was alert and oriented to self and place, however
VS were notable for a HR of 130s and sat of 84% on RA. He was
brought to the ED.
.
On arrival, patient was reportedly somnolent. His SBP was in the
70s and his sats were 80's on room air. Exam revealed guaiac
positive stool with melena. Hct was 21 with INR 4.0 He then
vomitted and was intubated for airway protection. An NG tube was
placed with lavage reportedly negative, but NG tube later
drained out 50cc of frank red blood. He had a torso CT that was
unremarkable. Head CT initially raised some concern for SAH but
upon reviewing, neurosurg considered the findings old infarct
without hemorrhage. ECG showed slow afib with no ischemic
changes. Trop was 0.17 with flat CK. Cr 3.9 from baseline 2.1.
He received one dose of vanc and zosyn, 2L of fluid with
improvement in BP and therefore got a femoral line placed with
initiation of norepinephrine. He received 3 u pRBCs, 4 FFP,
vitamin K 10 mg IV x 1, and activated facotr IX. After blood and
FFP transfusions, Hct improved to 30 and INR decreased to 2.2.
GI saw the patient in the ED, recommended EGD in a.m. with
serial Hcts and suppportive care.
.
Of note, patient was recently admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] from [**2110-4-15**] to
[**2110-4-25**] for CHF exacerbation. He was discharged to rehab with
furosemide 120 mg [**Hospital1 **]. Furosemide has been held for 2 days prior
to this admission with plan to restart on day of admission.
.
Complete review of systems is unable to be obtained due to
patient's sedation and intubaiton.

CT Head [**5-4**]: 1. Evolution of the right parietal infarct with
development of cortical serpiginous hemorrhage (laminar
necrosis). 2. Near-complete opacification of the nasopharynx.
Recommend clinical correlation.
.
CT Torso [**5-4**]: 1. Bowel wall thickening, most pronounced along
the right hemi-colon, compatible with colitis. The differential
diagnoses include infectious, inflammatory, and ischemic
etiologies. 2. Interval increase in a moderate right and small
left pleural effusion with right lower lobe consolidation
(likely aspiration). 3. Anasarca.
.
Right hip XR [**5-13**]:
Two frontal radiographs of the right hip are obtained in
relatively similar positioning. No fractures are identified,
although this assessment is suboptimal due to positioning and
patient's size. Multiple metallic clips overlie the partially
visualized pelvis suggesting lymph node dissection.  Focal
calcifications adjacent to the medial cortex of the proximal
femoral shaft are of unknown etiology but doubtful clinical
significance. IMPRESSION: No fracture.
.
CT Head [**5-14**]: FINDINGS: Exam is somewhat limited due to motion
artifact. Within this limitation, there is no evidence of new
acute hemorrhage or shift of normally midline structures. The
ventricles and sulci are prominent consistent with age-related
atrophy. Again identified is an area of hypodensity in the right
parietal lobe (2B, 31) consistent with evolving infarct. There
is a thin rim of cortical hyperdensity surrounding this area
likely representing hemorrhage in the setting of laminar
necrosis, unchanged. Progression of expected encephalomalacia is
also identified. Again identified is a likely left frontal
arachnoid cyst, unchanged in size and configuration. Diffuse
periventricular white matter hypodensities compatible with
chronic small vessel ischemic changes are unchanged. There has
been interval resolution of opacification of the nasopharynx.
The visualized paranasal sinuses are clear.
IMPRESSION:
1. No new areas of hemorrhage.
2. Evolving right parietal infarct with areas of laminar
necrosis and
serpiginous areas of hemorrhage, unchanged.
3. Resolution of opacification of the nasopharynx.
.
Right lower extremity U/S [**5-19**]: Normal right lower extremity
ultrasound examination. No evidence of DVT.
.
Video Swallow [**5-20**]: A swallowing videofluoroscopy study was done
in conjunction with the Speech Pathology service. Multiple
consistencies of oral barium were adm
