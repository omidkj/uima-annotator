.
CXR: Multifocal patchy opacities as described above. This is
concerning for PCP or multifocal pneumonia.
.
CT CHEST:
1) Numerous ill-defined patchy nodular opacities in bilateral
lungs, associated with underlying mild bronchiectasis and
emphysema, and somewhat consolidative opacity at the right lung
base. These findings are most likely representing infectious
process in this patient with AIDS, including PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 1074**] or other
viral infection, or fungus including aspergillosis, or bacterial
infection. Differential diagnosis include Lymphoma or Kaposi's
sarcoma. Please correlate clinically.
2) Bilateral pleural effusion associated with atelectasis.
3) Diffuse anasarca.
4) Small ascites and edematous appearance of peritoneal cavity.
.
ECHO:
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity size, and systolic function are normal
(LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally
normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. Mild (1+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. The estimated pulmonary artery
systolic pressure is normal. There is no pericardial effusion.
.



Brief Hospital Course:
A/P 45 y/o woman with history of AIDS (CD4 of 3) who presents
with fevers and SOB
.
1. PNA: Pt was initially admitted to the ICU for close
observation but then called out to the medical floor after
stabilzing on 4L of oxygen.  She was started on ceftriaxone and
azithromycin empirically to cover community acquired pneumonia.
Also, given her CD4 count and her PaO2 of <70, she was started
on prednisone and PCP treatment doses of Bactrim.  She was ruled
out for TB with three negative [**Name10 (NameIs) 11381**] sputums.  Pulmonary and ID
were consulted.  A CT scan of the chest showed numerous
ill-defined patchy nodular opacities in bilateral lungs along
with a consolidation at the right lung base.  A large pleural
effusion on the left was tapped and found to be exudative but
with a pH of 7.5.  A bronchoscopy found copius amounts of
purulent sputum which was sent for PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 11381**] and culture.  PCP
was negative and prednisone was stopped and Bactrim was changed
to the ppx dose.  No fungus or nocardia was isolated from BAL.
Urine legionella was negative.  Histoplasma, coccidioides and
cryptococcal antigen were all negative.  The BAL culture grew
out pseudomonas sensitive to ciprofloxacin so her ceftriaxone
and azithro were stopped and she was started on a 3 week course
of cipro.
.
2. HIV: Per pt and her PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] has not been taking HAART due to
severe side effects.  A CD4 count was checked and found to be 3
with a viral load of 47,800.  ID was consulted.  Once PCP was
ruled out, pt was started on ppx Bactrim and Azithromycin doses.
 Pt was not started on HAART therapy due to her acute illness.
She will follow-up in [**Hospital3 6616**].
.
3. Oral Thrush/candidiasis:  Pt was given nystatin swish and
swallow along with fluconazole for her severe thrush.  If she is
still having pain on swallowing after a 7-day course of
fluconazole, she should have an EGD for further evaluation.
.
4. Oral ulcers: Pt developed ulcers on her tongue and lips
suspicious for herpers.  A swab was positive for herpes but a
DFA could not be done due to insufficient cells.  She was given
a 7-day course of famcyclovir.
.
5. + [**Hospital3 1074**]: Pt was found to have a [**Hospital3 1074**] VL of 13,200 copies/ml.
Ophthalmology was consulted and ruled out [**Hospital3 1074**] retinitis.  ID did
not recommend treating her + [**Hospital3 1074**] VL.
.
6. Anemia: Pt's hct dropped to 21 during her acute illness and
she was transfused one unit of PRBCs.  Iron studies showed a
very low iron with a low TIBC and high ferritin thought to be
secondary to anemia of chronic disease.  After her transfusion
of one unit, she remained at 27-30.  A parvovirus was checked
and she was found to have +IgG, negative IgM.  She likely has
severe bone marrow suppression from her acute illness and her
HIV.
.
7. Bilateral Hip Pain: Pt has chronic hip pain.  She was
continued on her vicodin and switched over to oxycontin with
oxycodone for breakthrough.
.
8. Hyponatremia: Pt was noted to have a low Na during her
hospital stay.  Urina studies were checked and she was found to
have SIADH, likely from her pulmonary process.  Na remained
stable without treatment.
.
