History of Present Illness:
Mr [**Known lastname 9780**] is an 84 yo M with a history of cryptogenic cirrhosis
(c/b variceal bleed requiring [**Last Name (un) 10045**]/TIPS [**2171-7-9**]) and
afib/SSS (s/p dual chamber PPM) who was recently admitted from
[**Date range (1) 108604**] with UGI bleed and who was admitted this time on
[**2171-8-2**] with bilateral upper extremity ecchymosses that occurred
in the setting of therapeutic enoxaparin. He had some falls at
rehab but according to his wife these occurred after he already
had the bruises. A trauma workup in the ED was notable mainly
for a hematocrit drop of 30.3 at last dishcarge -> 23.7. He had
OB+ brown stool, negative NG lavage. It was felt that drop in
HCT was most likely related to arm.
He was admitted to the medical floor. Yesterday ([**8-3**]) his HCT
had further dropped to 20.0 and he was transfused 2 units of
pRBCs with appropriate increase to 26.0. He had loose stools
(but is on lactulose) which were reportedly not melanotic but
guiac positive. Early this morning ([**8-4**]) the patient was noted
to be in afib with RVR to the 150s which was asyptomatic. His
blood pressure dropped to 80s/doppler from systolic 110s at
baseline. He has not had any fevers but has had a leukocytosis
since admission. He denies cough or urinary symptoms. He was
therefore transferred to the MICU for management of his afib
with hypotension.

Of note, the patient was recently admitted [**Date range (1) 108604**] with
variceal bleeding, hypotension, and leukocytosis. He required
[**Last Name (un) 10045**] and TIPS. He also had 5 AVMs ablated. During his
hospital stay he was noted to have LUE swelling but LENI
negative for clot, however he was found to have thrombus in RIJ
and thrombus in R. cephalic vein. His dabigatran was stopped and
he was discharged on lovenox. His admission was also complicated
by ICU delirium.

On arrival to the MICU, the patient reports pain in arms left >
right from the injuries but otherwise does not have any other
new complaints.
