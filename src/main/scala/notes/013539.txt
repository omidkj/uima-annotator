History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 13469**] is a 68 year old gentleman with DM 2, seizure
disorder, dCHF, HTN, and neuropathy discharged yesterday after
completing an 11 day course of vancomycin for a LLL MRSA
pneumonia admitted for hypotension. The patient reports that
after discharge yesterday, he spent the night at [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 86**]
shelter. This morning, he reports feeling as if he was
"falling," that he "couldn't control his steps," and that his
"body short-circuited." Then then saw an EMS at [**Location (un) 86**] Common,
at which point he was noted to have a SBP 70s and was
transported to [**Hospital1 18**].
In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, VS 98.4 80/47 64 20 96%RA. He received 500 cc -
3L IVF without improvement in BP, and so a RIJ CVL was placed
and levophed was started. He was then admitted to the MICU for
further management. Labs were notable for an acetaminophen level
of 14, creatinine of 3.2 from 1.1 yesterday, and a lactate of
2.4 decreased to 1.6 after 3L IVF.
.
Currently, he states that his shortness of breath is stable. He
also endorses an increased cough since discharge that is
non-productive. Denies CP, f/c/s, n/v/d, abd pain, HA,
palpitations. States that his disequilibirum symptoms have since
resolved.
.
ROS: Also endorses orthostasis and decreased UOP over the past
day. As above, otherwise negative.

Brief Hospital Course:
Assessment and Plan: Mr. [**Known lastname 13469**] is a 68 year old gentleman with
DM 2, seizure disorder, dCHF, HTN, and neuropathy admitted for
Hypotension. Patient was discharged one day prior to admission
after completing an 11 day course of vancomycin for a LLL MRSA
pneumonia.
.
# Hypotension: Patient presented to EMS in [**Location (un) 86**] Common with a
blood pressure of 70/palpable. Unclear etiology. The patient
recently completed an 11 day course of vancomycin for possible
MRSA pneumonia at LLL that radiographically resolved prior to
discharge. During this admission, he remained afebrile without a
leukocytosis, although he does report increased cough without
sputum production. The patient also has a history of diabetic
neuropathy as well as orthostasis, and his intermitent
hypotension without a clear source may suggest autonomic
instability. Also, the patient was unclear as to his metoprolol
dosing, and may have taken excessive anti-hypertensives.
Finally, patient has a seizure disorder and it is unclear if
this added to this hypotension episode, even though a seizure
was not witnessed by anyone and patient has not memory of the
event.

 The patient was given over 3 liters of NS in the ED with
minimal response. He was then started on levophed and
transferred to the medical intensive care unit. He received one
dose of vancomycin and meropenem, but this was stopped per
infectious disease recommendations. Extensive labs were drawn;
TSH, B12, Folate, SPEP/UPEP, HIV, UA, UCx, BCx, PPD, cardiac
enzymes were all negative. A repeat chest CT showed a resolved
pneumonia, so unlikely could have contributed to this
hypotensive episode. During hypotensive episo
