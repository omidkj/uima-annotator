History of Present Illness:
Mr [**Known lastname 9241**] is a 78M with PMH of PVD, HTN, CAD s/p remote MI and
AAA repair transfered from [**Hospital3 **] after witnessed
VF arrest. Per ED notes and pt's wife, he was out shopping with
her this am, in USOH when collapsed. Immediate CPR administered.
EMS arrived within ~4 minutes, initial rhythm VF, was
defibrillated to asystole, received epi x 3, atropine with
conversion from PEA to pulsatile ST. Brought to [**Hospital 2436**] hosp,
intubated, lidocaine gtt initiated, pt transfered to [**Hospital1 18**].
.
In ED, noted to have guaiac + stool, BRBPR as well as coffee
ground aspirate in NGT with 1 episode BRB from NGT which cleared
with lavage, then return of coffee grounds. Hct stable from OSH.
Per report CT scan head/neck WNL and abd/pelvis without
aorto-enteric fistula; both done non-contrast at OSH. GI called
in ED, plan to scope in am. LFTs noted to be elevated. Wife
unaware of liver disease. INR 1.2. Transaminases in 200s. Trop
0.23, was 0.05 at OSH. ECG ST, 111. Similar to OSH, no priors
here. Started on esmolol gtt. Plts 77, ordered for plts. Typed
and screened. Vasc consulted given AAA. ? aorto-enteric fistula.
They assisted with obtaining OSH op records and recommended CTA.
While in ED developed AF with RVR, esmolol gtt initiated. Noted
to be intubated, sedated, withdrawing to painful stimuli.
Cooling was initiated with arctic sun protocol.
.
Initial ED VS 110 121/67 24 100% on vent.
At time of transfer VS: 96.0 92 109/67 16 100% on Fi02 100% CMV
PEEP 5 Vt 600
.
Pt intubated, sedated, unable to obtain ROS. Per wife had
occasional CP, took nitro. SOB with exertion, stable since [**1-29**],
able to climb 1 flight stairs slowly. Unable to walk 1 block. No
known h/o GIBs.

CARDIOLOGY:
.
TTE ([**12-20**]):
Conclusions
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is top
normal/borderline dilated. Due to suboptimal technical quality,
a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed
(LVEF= 20-25 %). The right ventricular cavity is moderately
dilated with severe global free wall hypokinesis. The number of
aortic valve leaflets cannot be determined. The aortic valve
leaflets are moderately thickened. There is no aortic valve
stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The estimated
pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Severely depressed
biventricular systolic function.

Cardiac cath ([**12-26**]):
COMMENTS:
1. Coronary angiography of this right dominant system revealed
three
vessel coronary artery disease. The LMCA did not have
significant
coronary artery disease. The LAD was calcified with a mid-vessel
80%
stenosis involving D1. The D1 had a proximal 50% and a
mid-vessel 80%
stenosis. The LCx had a proximal 50-60% lesion and was calcified
in the
mid-segment. The OM1 was large and bifurcating. The RCA was
subtotally
occluded in the mid vessel and distally filled via left to right

collaterals.
2. Limited resting hemodynamics demonstrated mildly elevated
left
ventricular filling pressure (LVEDP 15 mm Hg) and normal
systemic
arterial blood pressure (SBP 125 mm Hg). There was no gradient
upon
pullback of the catheter from the left ventricle to the aorta.
3. Left ventriculography was deferred due to renal dysfunction.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Mildly elevated left ventricular filling pressure.
.
EKG [**12-19**]:
Irregular rhythm but with well seen P waves in some leads
suggesting sinus
tachycardia with atrial premature beats. Borderline
intraventricular
conduction delay. ST-T wave abnormalities. No previous tracing
available for
comparison.
