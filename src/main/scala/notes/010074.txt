office today, she was unable to walk 10 feet and had no breath
sounds in her left lung base, thus she is admitted for ?pleural
effusion and for possible coronary catheterization as she could

Cath [**2155-7-24**]: "1.  Planned PCI.  Access was quite difficult.  We
used a
micropuncture set to get access in RFA but had to use a
Glidewire to
negotiate the tortuous iliacs and aorta.  We ultimated were able
to get
into ascending aorta and exchanged for a Amplatz wire and then
put up a
6F 90cm Shuttle sheath.
2.  Limited hemodynamics with BP 123/67 with HR 82 in sinus.
3.  POBA of OM1 with 2.25mm balloon resulting in dissection with
good
flow.
  FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. POBA of OM1"


Brief Hospital Course:
73F c 3VD and AAA, as well as DM, COPD and MMP now p/w
increasing DOE. Pt does have large L pleural effusion s/p cabg
which was drained on [**2155-7-24**], but has been reaccumulating since
then. Pt also had cath on [**7-25**] which resulted in a dissected
Lcx. She was admitted to the unit for hypotension on [**7-25**], rp
bleed and pericardial effusion ruled out and hypotension
resolved c IVF and decreased bblocker. c/o L shoulder pain which
seems msk in origin (reproducible by pressing on her shoulder
and reproducible with abduction of shoulder)
.
# CORONARIES: 3VD on cath from [**5-8**], attempted CABG but pt could
not tolerate bypass. Now s/p cath on [**7-25**] c no stents,
dissection of left circumflex. She was ruled out for MI. She was
continued on aspirin and started on plavix, but the plavix was
discontinued as patient did not recieves stents and may need
thoracentesis or pleurex tube in the next few weeks. Pt had
episode of nausea and lightheadedness which was similar to her
prior MI in [**2130**] on [**2155-7-30**] depressions in V4-V6.
She was ruled out for MI, and the EKG had normalized by the next
day. The ST depressions were attributed to demand [**3-3**]
tachycardia. Pt was continued on rosuvastatin.
.
# PUMP: Pt c systolic CHF c EF of ~40%. Her metoprolol was
decreased from 25 [**Hospital1 **] to 12.5 [**Hospital1 **] as her blood pressures were
consistently in the 90s on the higher dose. Of note, pt has
hypotensive for several hours on the day following her first
thoracentesis (pericardial eff and RP bleed were ruled out) and
pt responded well to 1LNS.
.
# RHYTHM: Pt was in sinus rhythm and monitored on telemetry
throughout her admission. Her rate was usually in the high 90s.
.
# L PLEURAL EFFUSION: Pt was found to have a large left pleural
effusion believed to be [**3-3**] her recent CABG. She received
diagnostic/therapeutic thoracentesis on admission which
reaccumulated over ~36 hours. Pt recieved a second thoracentesis
on [**7-28**] with a small amount of reaccumulation, but less than the
first time. Both samples were sent for analysis and were found
to be exudative which is consistent with post-cabg pleural
effusion. Fluid was also sent for cytology, which is pending. Pt
was started on lasix 20 to try to limit reaccumulation, which
she tolerated well.
.
# COPD/asthma-continued home COPD/asthma medicines. Pt did
occasionally recieve albuterol nebs with good result.
.
# L SHOULDER PAIN: Pt had some left shoulder pain which
developed after her first thoracentesis and radiated to her
elbow, likely musculoskeletal in origin (though pt was ruled out
for MI again when she had this pain). She will follow up with
her PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] 1 week.
.
# OSTEOPENIA: Pt was found to be osteopenic by cxr, and was
started on calcium and vitamin D. She may benefit from a dexa
scan as an oupatient.
.
# ANEMIA: improved from baseline, trended throughout her
admission. Felt to likely be [**3-3**] her MMP.
.
# continued rest of home meds (allergy meds, neuropathic pain
meds)
.
# DM: d/ced rosiglitazone and started on ISS as inpt. Her blood
sugars were found to be in the 140s to 150s so rarely recieved
coverage with humalog. She can restart her rosiglitizone.
.
#PT consulted and believed she would benefit from [**Hospital 98**] rehab.
.
FEN: diabetic cardiac diet
.
PROPHYLAXIS: heparin sc 5000 TID, colace, senna prn
