History of Present Illness:
This 77 year old Hispanic male with previous coronary artery
bypass grafting underwent cardiac catheterization recently after
he was noted on echocardiogram ([**2177-4-8**]) that his mitral
regurgitation was worsening.  Also of note the left atrial
volume was severely increased, the right atrium was also
markedly dilated and left ventricular function was 50-55%.
Cardiac surgery was consulted for surgical correction.

Aorta - Ascending:  3.1 cm  <= 3.4 cm
Findings
LEFT ATRIUM: Moderate LA enlargement. No spontaneous echo
contrast is seen in the LAA. No thrombus in the LAA.
RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Normal RA size. PFO is present.
Left-to-right shunt across the interatrial septum at rest.
LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thickness. Top normal/borderline
dilated LV cavity size. Mildly depressed LVEF.
RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.
AORTA: Normal aortic diameter at the sinus level. Normal
ascending aorta diameter. Normal descending aorta diameter.
Complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
AORTIC VALVE: Three aortic valve leaflets. Mildly thickened
aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS. Trace AR.
MITRAL VALVE: Moderately thickened mitral valve leaflets.
Myxomatous mitral valve leaflets. No mass or vegetation on
mitral valve. Mild mitral annular calcification. Torn mitral
chordae. Moderate to severe (3+) MR. [**Name13 (STitle) 15110**] to the eccentric MR

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify I was present in compliance with HCFA
regulations. The patient was under general anesthesia throughout
the procedure. The patient received antibiotic prophylaxis. The
TEE probe was passed with assistance from the anesthesioology
staff using a laryngoscope. No TEE related complications.
patient.
REGIONAL LEFT VENTRICULAR WALL MOTION:
Conclusions
PRE-CPB:1. The left atrium is moderately dilated. No spontaneous
echo contrast is seen in the left atrial appendage. No thrombus
is seen in the left atrial appendage.
2. A patent foramen ovale is present. A left-to-right shunt
across the interatrial septum is seen at rest.
3. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity size is top normal/borderline dilated.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed
(LVEF= 50 %).
4. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal.
5. There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending thoracic
aorta.
6. There are three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is no aortic valve
stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
7. The mitral valve leaflets are moderately thickened. The
mitral valve leaflets are myxomatous. No mass or vegetation is
seen on the mitral valve. Torn mitral chordae are present at P2.
There is also leaflet retraction of the anterior leaflet, which
is myxomatous. Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. The mitral annulus is dilated and measures 3.9 cm. Due to
the eccentric nature of the regurgitant jet, its severity may be
significantly underestimated (Coanda effect).
Drs. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and [**Name5 (PTitle) **] were notified in person of the
results.
POST-CPB: On infusion of phenylephrine. AV pacing. Well-seated
annuloplasty ring in the mitral position. No MR. [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 66755**]t (mean of 1 mmHg). No pfo is seen. A web in the left
atrium is visualized, and was confirmed by the surgeon at the
time of surgery. Preserved biventricular systolic function.
Aortic contour is normal post decannultion.
  I certify that I was present for this procedure in compliance
with HCFA regulations.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr.[**Known lastname 89252**] was admitted preoperatively for Heparin bridge from
Coumadin.  On [**2177-6-10**] he was brought to the Operating Room and
underwent a redosternotomy-mitral valve repair.  See operative
report for further details.  His ejection fraction post repair
was 50-60%.  He received Cephazolin for perioperative
antibiotics. He tolerated the procedure well and was transferred
to the CVICU for further invasive monitoring.

He was intubated and sedated on pressors to optimize
cardiovascular function. Medications were weaned off, he awoke
neurologically intact and was extubated postoperatively without
difficulty. All lines and drains were discontinued in a timely
fashion.
