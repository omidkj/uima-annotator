HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This 73-year-old gentleman who
presented with a right lower lobe tumor on a recent CT scan.
The scarring of his lung had been followed two years prior
from a chest x-ray.  He had some complaints of back pain this
year with loss of balance.   Occasionally, his ambulation had
been reduced to approximately one-half mile which brought on
angina in addition to any exertion like walking up a [**Doctor Last Name **].
He had a recent cardiac catheterization which showed an
ejection fraction of approximately 20% with multiple blocked
arterial vessels.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Myocardial infarction in [**2139**].
2.  Coronary artery bypass graft in [**2145**].
3.  Redo coronary artery bypass graft in [**2152**].
4.  Angioplasty in [**2163**]; the patient still occasionally has
angina; he had several angioplasties in [**2163**].
5.  A very recent smoking history.
6.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

ALLERGIES:  PENICILLIN which caused a question of
hyperthermia and STATINS which cause leg cramps.  He also
listed METHANOL as giving him a rash.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  His medications prior to admission
were aspirin, Colestid, captopril, and Lopressor.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  On examination, his lungs
were clear bilaterally.  His heart was regular in rate and
rhythm.  His abdominal examination was soft.

LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION:   Preoperative laboratory work
showed a white blood cell count of 8.3, a hematocrit of 37.3,
platelet count of 356,000.  Glucose 67, BUN 22,
creatinine 1.3, sodium 138, potassium 4.6, chloride 99,
bicarbonate 25.  Anion gap of 19.

RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:   Preoperative chest x-ray showed
calcified mediastinal lymph nodes and a vague opacity only
seen on the AP view.  The ill-defined opacity was in the
right base.  The examination was otherwise unremarkable.
Please refer to his final chest x-ray report.

Electrocardiogram showed sinus bradycardia with some
supraventricular extra systoles and a left bundle-branch
block.

PLAN:  The plan was for him to have a mediastinoscopy and
thoracoscopy with a question of a right lower lobectomy.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 175**] did note his increased risk of operation and
discussed it with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] of Cardiology who recommended
that it would reasonable to go ahead with monitoring,
although the risk was increased.

HOSPITAL COURSE:   On [**10-7**] he underwent a
bronchoscopy mediastinal thoracoscopy and a right left lower
lobectomy by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 175**].  He was transferred to the
Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit in stable condition.  He
was seen by the Acute Pain Service for follow up of his
epidural.

On postoperative day one, he was extubated.  He had been on a
little bit of Neo-Synephrine.  His central venous pressure
line was changed.  He was in sinus rhythm with premature
contractions in the 60s with a temperature maximum of 99.7.
He was satting reasonably well on 3 liters of nasal cannula.
He had no pleural leak and had 80 cc from his chest tube.
His hematocrit was 31.8.  He was neurologically intact.  He
had decreased breath sounds at the right lower lobe, but was
clear on the left.  His examination was otherwise
unremarkable.  He started pulmonary toilet.  His epidural
remained in place.  His calcium and magnesium were down
slightly.  His electrolytes were repleted.  His
Neo-Synephrine was weaned to off.  He started p.o. as
tolerated.  His Foley remained in place.  He was transferred
to the floor after weaning of his Neo-Synephrine.  He was
followed by the Acute Pain Service for his epidural.  He was
seen by Physical Therapy for help with his ambulation.  He
was seen by Case Management.

On postoperative day two, he was hemodynamically stable.  His
lungs were clear.  His heart was irregularly irregular.  His
chest tubes had a small air leak.  His abdominal was benign.
His extremities were warm.  A chest x-ray was checked to see
if there was a pneumothorax with plans to pull his chest
tubes if there was no pneumothorax as there was minimal chest
tube output.  He continued to work with Physical Therapy on
the floor.

On postoperative day three, he was sitting up comfortably.
He was afebrile with good vital signs.  His urine output was
good.  His lungs were clear.  His heart was regular in rate
and rhythm.  His abdominal examination benign with minimal
swelling in his extremities.  His chest tubes had been pulled
the evening prior.  His Foley catheter was removed in the
morning.  His epidural was removed.  He was ambulating well.
His central line was discontinued with plans for discharge in
the morning, and he was discharged to home on [**10-11**]
with the following discharge diagnoses.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
2.  Status post right lower lobectomy, bronchoscopy,
mediastinoscopy, mediastinal fluoroscopy.
3.  Status post myocardial infarction.
4.  Status post coronary artery bypass graft.
5.  Status post redo coronary artery bypass graft.
6.  Status post multiple angioplasties in [**2163**].
