HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the SICU
service.  It was unclear what the patient's respiratory
distress was due to, had been short of breath times two
weeks, and there was no strong evidence of infection.  The
patient was diuresed empirically and covered with
Levofloxacin for infection.  The patient was continued on
CPAP.

On [**2168-5-13**], the patient was continuing to require mask
ventilation.  The patient's code status was DNR/DNI and,
after speaking with the patient's daughter at length, the
daughter felt that it would be in the patient's best interest
to change goals of care to comfort measures only.

The patient also had worsening renal failure of unclear
etiology although his creatinine had appeared to be rising in
the past.  The patient ruled out for myocardial infarction
during this hospitalization as well.

The patient was started on a Morphine drip for comfort.  His
medications, telemetry and intravenous fluids were
discontinued.  On [**2168-5-13**], at 1:47 p.m., the patient was
found to be unresponsive and not to be breathing
spontaneously.  He had no heart sounds and no pulse.  The
patient's pupils were dilated and fixed.   The patient was
pronounced at 1:47 p.m..  The patient's daughter was spoken
to and declined postmortem examination at the time of death.

1.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
2.  Esophageal cancer.
3.  Respiratory failure.
