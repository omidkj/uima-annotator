Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 107485**] is a 58 year old man with history of diabetes,
ESRD on HD, CAD s/p MI who presents with left-sided chest pain
since dialysis the morning of admission. The chest pain is
around the site of his hemodialysis catheter, although the site
of the catheter is clean and dry without purulence or erythema.
The chest pain is constant and is non-pleuritic; he has had
similar episode in the past. He denies fever, shortness of
breath, abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. He reports that
his back is pruritic. He notes recent crack cocaine use in the
past three days.
.
In dialysis the morning of admission, his hematocrit was noted
to be 5. He denies bright red blood per rectum and hematemesis,
but he had an episode of melena several days ago. In the ED, his
vitals were He refused NG lavage but allowed placement of a
peripheral IV in the EJ along with another PIV. He was guaiac
negative x 2 in the ED. The renal hemodialysis team was
consulted in the emergency room.
.
He has had an extensive workup in the past including (at least)
six endoscopies, three colonoscopies, one enteroscopy, and a
capsule camera study; all studies have been negative with the
exception of small AVM's in the duodenum seen and cauterized on
one study, as well as minor jejunal erosions noted on the
capsule camera study. During his last admission (end of
[**Month (only) 359**]), he required 7 units of pRBC's.
.
GI was consulted and given pt's multiple admissions for GI bleed
and non-compliance with follow-up and active crack/cocaine use,
GI recommended no endoscopies at this time. Pt was transfused 2
units while in the MICu and his Hct stabilized at 26, up from 15
on presentation. Pt's mental status was initially altered and
given his substance abuse history he was placed on a CIWA scale.
 He cleared mentally without benzos and received haldol PRN
agitation.  He received hemofiltration for fluid overload and
pul edema and will continue on his outpt dialysis. His increased
troponins were attributed to his renal failure and his CK-MBs
remained WNL.

Brief Hospital Course:
58-yo man with diabetes, ESRD on HD, CAD s/p MI, substance
abuse, who presented with left-sided chest pain, found at HD to
have Hct 15.
.
#. Atrial fibrillation - Pt has known history of paroxysmal
atrial fibrillation and currently in A-fib. Usually
well-controlled with HR 90s-110s, but noted to have short
episodes of RVR over nights to the 140s-160s, treated with
Lopressor IV and PO with good response. No further events with
increased dose of labetalol, although pt remains in A-fib at
this point.  He was discharged on labetalol at 200mg [**Hospital1 **], and
without anticoagulation given his anemia and GI bleeding.
.
#. Anemia - Pt reports an episode of melena approx 4-5 days PTA,
although he has had no episodes of melena or BRBPR since that
time. He has had many prior scopes and is known to have small
bowel AVMs. Guaiac negative x2 in the ED, refused NG lavage, no
evidence of hemolysis. GI aware, no plan to scope currently. He
received 5units PRBCs during his MICU course, as well as DDAVP
25mg IV x1 for uremic bleeding on admission, and his Hct has
responded nicely and continues to be stable at 27-30 (baseline
Hct 32-36). He was continued on a PO PPI [**Hospital1 **], and his ASA and
anticoagulation were held. He received Epo at HD.
.
#. ESRD on HD - Pt has received HD through AVF on this
admission, as his HD catheter was known to be clotted and was
then removed [**12-16**]. Renal team aware, appreciate involvement.
The patient received ultrafiltration for pulmonary edema, and
received Epo as above for his anemia.
.
#. Altered Mental Status - Pt noted to have AMS by MICU team,
felt to be multifactorial due to anemia and cocaine use. Now
appears to be at baseline. Patient also advised to see a
psychiatrist for treatment of his depression, and to avoid
illicit drugs.
.
#. CAD - Pt was noted to have ECG changes on admission (TWI
V5-V6), with last stress test [**2152**] showing reversible defects
inferiorly and laterally. CEs flat x3 on admission.  His ASA was
held given his anemia / GI bleeding as above, but he was
continued on his labetalol and lisinopril.
.
#. Hypertension - currently stable on home anti-hypertensives.
His labetalol was titrated for rate control of his atrial
fibrillation.
.
#. CHF - noted to have decreased EF [**9-/2154**], currently stable.
He was continued on his home BB and ACE-I.
.
#. Diabetes - Pt is on [**Hospital1 **] NPH at home.  He was continued on [**Hospital1 **]
NPH and his doses were titrated. He was also covered with an
insulin sliding scale and kept on a diabetic diet.
.
#. Hyperlipidemia - He was continued on atorvastatin at home
dose.
.
#. Pruritus - DDx for etiology: uremia vs. narcotic effect. He
was treated with Sarna lotion.
.
