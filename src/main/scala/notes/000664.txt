Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1835**]
Chief Complaint:
Ataxia,gait instability

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**4-14**]: Right Posterior Fossa Craniotomy/craniectomy for mass
resection


History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 80652**] was well until last week or two when she had noticed
increasing headaches.  The headaches were worse when she was
straining with bowel movements or laughing, but often it also
came with or without any precipitating factors.  She was also
noticed being clumsy and having loosing her balance as well.
She has not had any visual disturbances.  No other signs of
intracranial tensions like headache, nausea, vomiting, or other
motor, sensory, or neurological deficits. She had a head CT,
which showed right lateral CP angle mass
measuring about 4.8 x 4.7 cm.  This was heterogeneously
enhancing.  An MRI confirmed this mass also.

CT head [**2124-4-10**]:
FINDINGS: Centered in the right lateral posterior fossa,
adjacent to the
cerebellopontine angle, there is an apparent extra-axial, 4.8 x
4.7 cm,
heterogeneous, avidly-enhancing mass with small foci of
calcification along
the rim. On non- contrast images, this lesion is slightly
hyperdense compared to brain parenchyma, particularly along the
rim, with central hypodense region. There is resulting mass
effect and compression of right cerebellar hemisphere. There is
no erosion or definite hyperostosis identified of the adjacent
bone. There is mass effect resulting in compression of the right
perimesencephalic cistern, and leftward displacement of the
fourth ventricle, which still appears patent. There is evidence
of tonsillar herniation. Overall, the ventricles have a slightly
enlarged appearance, which could reflect a mild degree of
outflow obstruction. The right jugular vein appears patent as
well as part of the sigmoid sinus. However, the tumor effaces
the sigmoid sinus within its groove at the level of the fourth
ventricle. The sigmoid and transverse sinus cephalad to this
region appear patent. Elsewhere, there is no intracranial
hemorrhage, edema, shift of normally midline structures or
evidence of major vascular territorial infarcts. The remaining
basilar cisterns are patent. The [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white differentiation in
the cerebral cortex is preserved. There is no fracture. Mastoid
air cells and paranasal sinuses are well aerated. Soft tissues
are normal.
IMPRESSION: Large right posterior fossa extraaxial, enhancing,
heterogeneous mass resulting in tonsillar herniation,
compression of the right perimesencephalic cistern and
displacement of fourth ventricle, likely causing a mild degree
of outflow obstruction. The adjacent sigmoid sinus appears
effaced. The imaging findings are most consistent with a large
meningioma. A contrast-enhanced MRI could provide further
information, including the patency of the adjacent sigmoid
sinus.

MRI head [**2124-4-10**]:
FINDINGS: In comparison with a prior examination, again on the
right side of the posterior fossa, there is a large apparently
extra-axial mass lesion, measuring approximately 5.0 x 4.5 cm in
transverse dimensions x 4.5 x 4.5 cm in the coronal MP-RAGE
projection. This lesion demonstrates mild hyperintense signal in
comparison with the rest of the brain parenchyma on T1 without
contrast. No restricted diffusion is identified. Several
heterogeneous signal areas are visualized on the FLAIR sequence
within this mass lesion, possibly related with punctate
calcifications and hyperintensity signal areas on T2, possibly
related with small areas with cystic transformation. With
gadolinium contrast, this lesion enhance avidly, mild vasogenic
edema is identified and significant mass effect and shifting of
the fourth ventricle towards the left. The prepontine cistern
apparently is preserved, mild effacement of the inferior right
collicular cistern is demonstrated. Supratentorially, there is
no evidence of abnormal enhancement and both cerebral
hemispheres are grossly normal, no diffusion abnormalities are
detected. The ventricles are slightly prominent, however no
significant transependymal migration of CSF is demonstrated.
Multiple areas of hyperintensity signal are visualized in the
periventricular white matter, likely consistent with chronic
areas of gliosis or small vessel disease. Normal flow void is
identified in the major vascular structures, the right posterior
fossa mass lesion lesion is in close contact with the right
trasverse sinus. The coronal and sagittal images demonstrate
right tonsillar herniation, approximately 1.5 cm of tonsillar
herniation is demonstrated on the sagittal image. The orbits,
the paranasal sinuses, and the mastoid air cells appear within
normal limits.
IMPRESSION:
1. Large extra-axial right posterior fossa mass lesion, with
significant pattern of enhancement and areas of heterogeneous
signal, more
likely consistent with a large meningioma, resulting in right
tonsillar
herniation, mass effect, and compression of the fourth ventricle
as described in detail above.
2. Multiple areas of hyperintensity signal are visualized in the
periventricular white matter, likely consistent with chronic
areas of gliosis or small vessel disease, however, nonspecific.
No other lesions or areas with abnormal enhancement are
demonstrated.
