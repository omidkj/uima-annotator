presyncope

None.


History of Present Illness:
24 yom with no PMH who 2 days ago while swimming became "dizzy,"
resolving with rest. Sensation was intermittent and he thought
it was possibly due to his childhood asthma. He tried inhalers
without relief. On the day of admission he was bending down to
pick things up at the pool and noted tat he got lightheaded
every time he stood back up. He describes an associated
"throbby" feeling in his chest, however denies CP or overt
palpitations. He experienced mild SOB with episodes. Denies any
orhopnea, PND, LE edema.
On ROS, pt. describes being in his usual state of health until 2
days ago. He denies fevers or chills, uri symptoms, constipation
or skin changes. One episode of diarrea a few days ago.
At baseline, pateitn swims laps, is not limited by SOB or CP or
any activities. No history of syncope.
In the ED, patient found to have hr in 180s. Initially, rate too
rapid to identify type of tachycardia on EKG (appeared to be
supraventricular), and patient received adenosine which
decreased rate and unmasked atrial fibrillation. He was given 10
mg IV diltiazem + 30 mg PO diltiazem, which decreased HR 110s.
HR increased again however and he was started on diltiazem drip
and sent to CCU.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was brought to the cardiac critical care unit with
continued atrial fibrillation while on a diltiazem IV drip. He
was subsequently cardioverted with 2 rounds of 1 mg ibutilide
given IV. He remained in normal sinus rhythm thereafter. The
cause of his atrial fibrillation was considered to be a benign
response to vagal trigger. Given the patient's age and lack of
other cardiac medical history, anticoagulation and
antiarrhythmic medications are not necessary at this time. The
patient was scheduled for an outpatient echocardiogram to
evaluate for occult structural disease and also will follow-up
with a cardiologist as an outpatient.

Medications on Admission:
None

Discharge Medications:
None

Discharge Disposition:
Home

Discharge Diagnosis:
Atrial fibrillation


Discharge Condition:
Improved, no orthostasis, back in normal sinus rhythm.


Discharge Instructions:
You had an episode of atrial fibrillation, which is an abnormal
heart rhythm that was terminated with medication in the
hospital.  In the future, if you have these events and are
feeling poorly, please return to the hospital.  Otherwise,
provided you feel generally well, you should try lying down and
relaxing; this heart rhythm frequently terminates on its own.

You should make the follow up appointments as listed below.  You
will need to have an echocardiogram of your heart (see phone
number below) within the week.

We advise continuing your efforts to lose weight as this will
benefit your overall health, and may help to prevent further
episodes of this heart rhythm.

Followup Instructions:
Please call [**Telephone/Fax (1) 3312**] or [**Telephone/Fax (1) 69442**] to schedule an
echocardiogram within the week.

Please call [**Telephone/Fax (1) 285**] to schedule an appointment with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] (cardiologist) within the next 1-2 months.

Please establish care with a primary care doctor who can help
with routine health monitoring and may be able to help you with
weight loss.
