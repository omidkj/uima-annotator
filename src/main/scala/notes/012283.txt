History of Present Illness:
40 y/o female with MMP including morbid obesity, HTN, CHF EF
40%, atrial fibrillation on AC, COPD s/p multiple
intubations/prior trach, and ethanol abuse who presented to the
ED with SOB. The patient was found to be in acute respiratory
failure and she was emergently intubated in the ED. She was also
found to be in atrial fibrillation with RVR and started on an
esmolol gtt. There was also a concern for acute CHF and she was
started on a nitro gtt. She was not accompanied by any family.
Recent documentation in OMR regarding conversations with her PCP
indicate that she had felt more SOB of late and has not been
compliant with her medications. There was also concern expressed
about her living situation.
.
In the ED, vitals upon presentation were: T 101.2, HR 146, BP
112/68, RR 40, and 94-100% (no documentation of oxygen
requirement).
.
ED course: Patient was noted to c/o CP and SOB x 1 week. She has
been unable to sleep and was tearful and anxious. She was given
nebulizer treatment, solumedrol, and zofran. She was started on
CPAP. Given worsening respiratory status, she was emergently
intubated with anesthesia. She was started on a versed and
fentanyl gtt. She was started on a nitro gtt and esmolol gtt.
She was also given Lasix 80 mg IV x 1. She was also given
levaquin 750 mg IV x 1, vancomycin 1 gram IV x 1, and flagyl 500
mg IV x 1. She was transferred to the MICU intubated, sedated,
and on the above mentioned gtts.

Pertinent Results:
CXR [**2184-9-16**]
Cardiomegaly. Findings consistent with interval development of
pulmonary edema with bilateral pleural effusions.

U/A negative.

UCx negative.

[**2184-9-17**] U/S B/L.
No DVT
.
[**2184-9-17**] TTE
The left atrium is normal in size. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). The right ventricular
cavity is moderately dilated. There is severe global right
ventricular free wall hypokinesis. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion. No
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
structurally normal. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is moderate
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
effusion.
IMPRESSION: Dilated right ventricle with severe RV systolic
dysfunction.
Preserved global left ventricular systolic function. Moderate
tricuspid
regurgitation. Moderate pulmonary hypertension.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2184-6-15**],
right
ventricular function has probably deteriorated, but RV was not
as well seen on the prior study. Tricuspid regurgitation is more
severe. Compared with the study from [**2184-2-28**], where RV was
better seen, right ventricular function is now worse.


Brief Hospital Course:
40 y/o female with MMP including morbid obesity, HTN, dCHF EF >
55%, atrial fibrillation on AC, COPD s/p multiple
intubations/prior trach, and ethanol abuse who presented to the
ED with SOB. She was intubated emergently in the ED and admitted
to the MICU for respiratory failure.
.
# Respiratory failure
The patient was found to be in respiratory failure and was
emergently intubated in the ED. The reason for her respiratory
failure was multifactorial in etiology. She was found to have a
MRSA PNA. She received vanc, flagyl, and levofloxacin in the ED.
Levo and vanc were continued and once a sputum culture grew
MRSA, she was continued on a 10 day total course of vancomycin
and the levofloxacin was D/C. She has a h/o OSA and obesity
hypoventilation syndrome. She was also volume overloaded and she
was diuresed throughout this admission. On [**2184-9-23**], she
self-extubated herself and was reintubated. She was then
electively extubated on [**2184-9-24**] and was stable since then. She
was extremely difficult to wean from the ventilator [**2-27**] to
hypercarbic respiratory failure in the setting of severe OSA and
obesity hypoventilation syndrome. She is s/p trach in [**3-5**],
removed after discharge at rehab. There was concern that if she
was not able to be extubated that she would need another trach.
However, it became easier to wean her from the vent which
resulted in a successful extubation. She did receive one dose of
IV steroids in ED. She underwent bronchoscopy which revealed
bronchospastic airways and bronchomalacia. She was continue on
INH/nebs and finished a course of steroids. She requires BIPAP
at night, [**12-29**] without any supplemental oxygen.
.
# Atrial fibrillation
She was initially admitted and found to be in atrial
fibrillation with a RVR. She was started on an esmolol gtt in
the ED which was not continued in the MICU. She was given
antihypertensives IV which controlled her HR. Her PO meds were
gradually restarted. She was maintained on a heparin gtt given
possibility of a trach. Once she was extubated, she was started
back on her home dose of Coumadin.
.
# Cardiac
She was found to have evidence of severe right sided heart
disease on TTE and cardiology was consulted. Her right-sided
failure and severe RV disease was felt to be secondary to her
severe pulmonary disease. Her medications were optimized.
.
# Hallucinations
When the pt was extubated, she had some hallucinations. She has
a h/o depression with psychotic features. She was started on
Wellbutrin and her agitation responded well to PRN Haldol.
