Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1936**]
Chief Complaint:
C2 Fracture and PE

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Placement of IVC filter

History of Present Illness:
The patient is an 87 yo woman with h/o osteoporosis, multiple
recent falls, CAD, who presents from nursing home with C2
fracture and evidence of pulmonary embolus.  The patient was in
her usual state of health at her nursing home until yesterday
morning when she sustained a fall when trying to get up to go to
the bathroom.  The fall was not witnessed, but the patient
reportedly did not lose consciousness.  At 3:30 that afternoon,
the patient complained of neck and rib pain. She was taken to
OSH, where she was found to have a comminuted fracture of C2.
She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation.  Of note,
the patient was recently treated for CDiff infection at her
nursing facility, per discussion with her daughter.
.
In the ED, the patient's VS were T 99.1, BP 106/42, P 101, R 24.
 She had an ECG which showed sinus tachycardia and ST
depressions in V3 and V4.  CT head was negative for ICH.  She
was seen by Trauma surgery, who recommended stabalization with a
cervical collar for the next six to eight weeks, but they deemed
that she is not an operable candidate.  While imaging the
patient's cervical spine, she was found to have a large saddle
pulmonary embolism.  After discussion with the surgery team and
the patient's family, agreement was made to start the patient on
systemic anticoagulation.  She was thus transferred to the ICU
for further monitoring.
.
In the MICU, the patient states that she still has pain in her
neck, but it has decreased from previously.  The patient is a
poor historian.  Per discussion with the patient's daughter, she
is interested in initiating anticoagulation if recommended.

Laboratories on discharge:
[**9-25**]: INR=3.0

Imaging studies:

CT of the spine: IMPRESSION:
Comminuted fracture of the C2 vertebral body extending to the
transverse
foramina bilaterally and involving the base with a minimally
displaced
fragment anteriorly. A CTA or MRA of the neck is recommended to
exclude
vertebral arterial injury.

Minimal anterolisthesis of C3 on C4 with widening of the disc
space
anteriorly, which may suggest ligamentous injury. MRI is
recommended for
further evaluation.

Linear slightly hyperdense material extending from the clivus,
along the
anterior spinal canal, to the C3-C4 level, may represent
epidural hemorrhage. No evidence of spinal cord compression.
This can be evaluated at the time of MRI of the cervical spine.

Disc bulges at C3-C5 with narrowing of the central canal.

CT of the neck:
IMPRESSION:

No definite evidence for dissection. MRA would be more sensitive
for
detection of mural hematoma using fat-sat T1-weighted images.

Filling defects suggesting pulmonary emboli in the right greater
than left
pulmonary arteries. These findings were discussed by Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 82994**]
with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] at 12:05 a.m. on [**2195-9-19**].

Lower extremity doppler: IMPRESSION:
1. Fairly extensive thrombus in the right superficial femoral
vein.
2. No thrombus on the left.

Echo ([**9-21**]):  The left atrium and right atrium are normal in
cavity size. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic
function (LVEF>55%). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an
increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened (?#). No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are moderately
thickened. There is mild functional mitral stenosis (mean
gradient 6 mmHg) due to mitral annular calcification. No mitral
regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity
of mitral regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.]
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is
an anterior space which most likely represents a fat pad.

IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
preserved global and regional biventricular systolic function.
Mild functional mitral stenosis. Mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension.


Brief Hospital Course:
The patient is an 87 yo woman with h/o osteoporosis, DM2,
dementia, depression, and anxiety who presents s/p fall with
evidence of C2 fracture, bilateral pulmonary emboli and C. diff
colitis.
.
# Pulmonary emboli:  CTA of the patient's neck showed evidence
of right and left pulmonary artery emboli which straddle the
bifurcation but it is not occlusive. Given that the patient had
a recent hospitalization for pneumonia, she might have developed
the PE while in the hospital, i.e. this was a provoked PE. The
patient remained hemodynamically stable and required 2L of
oxygen initially. An echo revealed a normal right ventricle with
mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. The patient was
anticoagulated with a heparin gtt and started on Coumadin. On
transfer to the general medicine floors, the patient remained
stable. The family decided for placement of an IVC filter which
will be removed in four weeks. Her INR on the day of
discharge=3.0. She will need INR checks for the next 5 days with
a goal INR=[**3-10**].
.
# C2 Fracture:  The patient has a transverse comminuted fracture
of C2. Neurosurgery evaluated her and determined that she is not
a surgical candidate. The neurosurgery team recommends a
cervical collar until after her followup appointment on [**11-5**].
Her pain is controlled with Tylenol 1 g QID and breakthrough
Oxycodone.
.
# C diff colitis:  The patient presented with a WBC count to 30K
on admission and diffuse abdominal pain. Vancomycin was added to
her Flagyl while in the ICU. On transfer to the floors, the
Flagyl was discontinued. Vancomycin will be continued until
[**10-4**]. On discharge, the patien
