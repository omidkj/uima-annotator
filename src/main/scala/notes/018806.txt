Service:

This is an 83-year-old male who presents from an outside
hospital with multiple episodes of chest pain.  He was found
to have an elevated troponin.  He underwent cardiac
catheterization which showed three-vessel disease with an
ejection fraction of 25% and was transferred to [**Hospital1 **] for planned CABG.

Of note during his stay at the outside hospital, he was found
to have a [**12-25**] A-V block and needed ventricular pacing.  His
Lopressor was stopped and he also had hematuria, which
Urology was consulted.

His past medical history is significant with chronic anemia,
history of PE with an IVC filter in place, chronic venous
stasis ulcers and disease, colon cancer status post colectomy
in the 70s.

MEDICATIONS:  He was on aspirin.  He was on a Heparin drip.
He was on Imdur 30 mg q day, hydroxyzine, and lisinopril.

He had no known drug allergies.

His lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally.  His heart
was regular rate, but bradycardic.  His abdomen was soft,
nontender, nondistended.  Bowel sounds are present.  He had a
positive colectomy.  He had good pulses.

He was taken to the operating room on [**2117-8-3**] where a CABG
x2 was performed.  The patient had a LIMA to left anterior
descending artery, a [**Doctor Last Name 4726**]-Tex graft to the right RDA and a
left radial to OM.  The patient was transferred to the SICU
postoperatively.  He was slowly weaned from his ventilator
and was extubated.  He was also started on Plavix for his
radiograph as well as for his [**Doctor Last Name 4726**]-Tex graft.  He continued
to do well.

The patient's monitor was slowly turned off, and he was found
to be significantly bradycardic and Electrophysiology was
consulted.  Electrophysiology saw the patient and found that
he has had bradycardic heart rate.  It was decided at that
time for a pacemaker to be placed, and it is scheduled to be
done after discharge at a cardiac rehab facility.  Physical
therapy was also consulted to assess ambulation, and he did
well.  However, physical therapy agreed with
Electrophysiology in requesting patient go to rehabilitation
for potential increased physical therapy and range of motion.

Patient was transferred to the floor postoperatively and he
continued to improve.  Foley was removed.  He was unable to
urinate, therefore Foley was replaced.  Patient was not
started on beta blockade because for his sinus bradycardia
and for antinodal blockade.  The patient was continued on the
pacemaker at that time and continued on Imdur and Plavix for
his graft.  His pacer was set for DDI at 60.  He continued to
improve at that time.

On [**2117-8-9**] postoperative day #7, the patient was discharged
to rehab facility in stable condition with plan to have a
pacer placement at that time.  The patient was discharged.

Discharge medications include Imdur 30 mg po q day, Plavix 75
mg po q day, captopril 12.5 mg po tid, Percocet 1-2 tablets
po q4 hours prn, aspirin 325 mg po q day, Zantac 150 mg po
