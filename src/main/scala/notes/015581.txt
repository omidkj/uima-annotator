History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 67 yo male with PMH of CAD who was recently
admitted (1/10-14/11) for 4 vessel CABG after found to have
severe CAD on cath in [**2169-11-29**]. He also had resection of LV
outlet tumor which was found to be papillary fibroelastoma. He
presented to his PCP's office today and had some mild shortness
of breath and was feeling generally unwell. He began to feel
somewhat unwell about 6 days ago at work when he missed work and
had a blood sugar in the 50s. He had some episodes of
lightheadedness, which he thought was related to low blood
sugar. He has also been dyspneic on exertion. He denied chest
pain, palpitations, orthpnea, PND. An EKG was performed and
showed ST depression in the lateral leads and ST elevations in
R-sided leads. He was given aspirin 325 mg po x 1 was was sent
to the ED for further management.
.
In the ED, initial vitals were AF, P: 72, BP: 115/72, RR: 18,
99% on RA. EKG showed NSR with ST dep lateral leads, ST
elevations in R sided leads. He was treated with heparin drip,
integrillin and aspirin 325 mg po daily and was transferred to
the CCU for further management.
.
On review of systems, he has had mild dry cough that has
persisted since his surgery. He denies myalgias, joint pains,
hemoptysis, red stools. He denies recent fevers, chills or
rigors. All of the other review of systems were negative.

Imaging:
Cardiac Cath ([**2170-3-7**]): Formal report pendings - reported
findings below:
- LAD Occluded mid vessel after D1 takeoff. Mid diagonal 80%
lesion.
- LCX:  No angiographically-apparent CAD proximally with small
OM1 widely patent.  OM2 has mid vessel 95% at touchdown of
occluded SVG.
- RCA:  Mild luminal irregularities with distal diffuse disease
in the PDA and total occlusion with Right to right collaterals
in a 1.5 mm.
- SVG-OM1:  Occluded.
- SVG-OM2: Occluded.
- SVG-Diagonal:  Diffuse disease proximally 60-70%.
- LIMA-LAD: Atretic to diffusely diseased small LAD
.
ECHO ([**2170-3-9**]):
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There is moderate to
severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
anterior, septal and apical akinesis. The remaining segments
contract normally (LVEF = 30-35%). No masses or thrombi are seen
in the left ventricle. Right ventricular chamber size and free
wall motion are normal. The number of aortic valve leaflets
cannot be determined. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
structurally normal. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild
(1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary artery systolic
pressure could not be determined. There is no pericardial
effusion.

IMPRESSION: Moderate to severe regional left ventricular
systolic dysfunction, c/w CAD. No LV thrombus. Mild mitral
regurgitation.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2169-12-13**],
the findings are similar.

Brief Hospital Course:
ID: 67 yo male with PMH of CAD who was recently admitted
(1/10-14/11) for 4 vessel CABG who presented with mild dyspnea
on exertion and EKG changes with elevation of cardiac biomarkers
concerning for graft stenosis no s/p cardiac catheterization
yesterday .
.
# CORONARIES: Patient had known 4 vessel disease and was s/p
bypass graft on [**2170-1-8**]. He had been recovering well until he
began to feel somewhat unwell several days prior to admission.
He also began to notice mild dyspnea on exertion without chest
pain, orthopnea, PND. His dyspnea was thought to be his anginal
equivalent. Given the fact that the patient's troponin was
slightly elevated, a diagnossi of non-ST elevation MI was made.
.
Pt was given 600mg plavix load and mucomyst pre/post treatment
for dye. Repeat cath on [**3-8**] revealed that the SVGs were
occluded and that LIMA lead to diffusely diseased vessel
unlikely to provide significant cardiac perfusion. During cath,
balloned OM1. Per interventional cardiology, pt will need to
return for another cath for stenting of SVG-diag in [**4-4**] weeks
after acute changes from initial bypass have quieted down since
the stenting will likely take place in one of the bypassed
vessels. Whil in hospital pt continued on ASA and metoprolol at
home doses. Lisinopril was increased from 10mg to 20mg daily and
statin was changed to Rovastatin 20mg daily in order to optimize
medical management. Unfortunately, the patient has had rather
rapid failure of his bypass grafts.
.
# PUMP: Patient has known depressed systolic function (EF
30-35%). He has no signs of volume overload on admission. He was
continued on home ACE-I and BB as noted above. Repeat TTE on
[**2170-3-9**] showed anterior, septal and apical akinesis with
depressed EF that was overal similar to prior ECHO but did not
show hoped for improvement in systolic function after bypass.
.
#Diabetes Mellitus II: Patient's last A1c was 7.1%. He has been
managed at home with metformin 850 mg po tid and with insulin-
novolin and novolog for his diabetes. He has had several
episodes of hypoglycemia recently and his blood sugar may be too
tightly controlled. While in house, we  decreased novolin from
40 mg [**Hospital1 **] to 20 mg [**Hospital1 **] given recent low FS and in light of that
patient will be NPO for tomorrow's cath. Kept on ISS to cover
high sugars and metformin held during hospitalization in light
of cardiac cath and associated dye load.
.
# Hyperlipidemia: well controlled. last lipids well controlled
on [**2170-1-4**]- TC 104, HDL 37, LDL 48. As above, statin changed to
Rovastatin 20mg daily to optimize lipid reduction in setting of
bad coronary disease with little available as interventional
options and all efforts being made to optimize medical
management.
.
# Hypertension: currently well-controlled. Continued on home
metoprolol and lisinopril.
