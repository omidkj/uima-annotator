Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2736**]
Chief Complaint:
Angina

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac Catheterization


History of Present Illness:
61 y/o M with hx of DMT2, hyperlipidemia, fam hx of premature
CAD presents with dull aching chest pain since [**2186-8-5**],
[**7-14**] over precordium, no radiation, worse with exertion
(carrying groceries up a flight of stairs will elicit CP),
lasting for most of the day and unrelieved by SLNTG. He also
reports DOE, walks 100 feet before getting SOB, but no PND, no
orthopnea. He saw his cardiologist who referred him for a GI
consultation but no gastric etiology was found.  On [**2186-9-26**] he was admitted to [**Hospital3 417**] with chest pain, stress
echo enremarkable at the time. He also underwent a kidney
ultrasound, a chest and abdominal ultrasound and a CT of the
chest which revealed coronary artery calcification.  He was
referred by his cardiologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 15069**], for a cardiac
catheterization to further evaluate his coronary anatomy.

Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of paroxysmal
nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope
or presyncope.

He was admitted to CMI service for elective c. cath. Cath
revealed severe 98% RCA disease s/p 1 DES and 1 BM stent,
diffuse 50% LAD, LCX diffuse disease, LVEF 45%. Post cath, he
developed hypotension 84/53, STAT echo without effusion, CT abd
without RP bleed. Atropine 2 mg total given, NS given, foley
inserted and drained 800cc urine. Upon insertion of foley, SBP
rose back to baseline. Pt was CP free during this.

In the CCU, he is currently CP free and feeling without
complaints. ROS positive for chronic cough and hx of
hemorrhoidal bleeding. He denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains. He denies recent fevers,
chills or rigors. He denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All
of the other review of systems were negative.

TELEMETRY demonstrated: NSR

2D-ECHOCARDIOGRAM performed on [**11-20**] demonstrated: (prelim) Due
to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality
cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size
and free wall motion are normal. There is no pericardial
effusion. There is an anterior space which most likely
represents a fat pad. IMPRESSION: No pericardial effusion.
Normal biventricular function.

Cardiac Cath [**2186-11-20**]:
1.  Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system

demonstrates 2 vessel coronary artery disease.  The mid LAD at
the site
of bifurcation with the 1st diagonal artery has diffuse,
calcified
50-60% disease.  The LCx artery and its branches are without
obstructive
lesions. The mid-RCA has a discrete 95% stenosis and gives rise
to the
PDA and RPL arteries.
2.  Limited resting hemodynamic measurements demonstrates high
normal
central aortic pressure of 140/66mmHg.  The LVEDP is severely
elevated
at 26mmHg.  There is no gradient between the left ventricle and
the
aorta.
3.  Left ventriculography demonstrates mild systolic dysfunction
with a
calculated ejection fraction of 45% and inferior posterior
hypokinesis.
4.  Successful PTCA and stenting of the proximal RCA with
overlapping
Cypher (3.5x18mm) drug eluting stent (distal) and a Driver
(3.5x15mm)
bare metal stent.  Both stents were postdilated with a 3.5mm
balloon.
Final angiography demonstrated no angiographically apparent
dissection,
no residual stenosis and TIMI III flow throughout the vessel
(See PTCA
Comments).

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Two vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Low- normal systolic ventricular function with moderate to
severe
diastolic dysfunction.
3. Successful PTCA and stenting of the proximal RCA with an
overlapping
drug eluting and bare metal stent.
.
ECHO [**2186-11-21**]: The left atrium is normal in size. The estimated
right atrial pressure is 0-5 mmHg. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is mild
regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with mild mid to
apical inferolateral wall hypokinesis. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Transmitral Doppler and
tissue velocity imaging are consistent with normal LV diastolic
function. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve appears
structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is
no pericardial effusion.
.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2186-11-20**],
the mild inferolateral wall hypokinesis is better appreciated.
Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal overall
systolic function and diastolic function.

Brief Hospital Course:
CAD/Ischemia: S/p c. cath found to have [**1-7**] vessel disease and
status post DES and BMS to RCA.  Patient was continued on
integrillin for 18hours post cath, started on plavix, should
continue for at least 12 months post intervention given drug
eluting stents.  Continue full dose aspirin, zetia, simvastatin
and tricor for cholesterol managagement.  Continue lisinopril,
decreased to 2.5 daily.  Patient was started on Toprol XL 25mg
daily.  He should have these medications titrated to BP and HR
as outpatient.  Cholesterol studies pending upon discharge.
.
Hypotension: patient had a transient episode of post cath
hypotension with no RP bleed and no echo signs of tamponade. The
episode was transient and thought to be due to high vagal tone
from urinary retention, his hypotension spontaneously resolved
after foley placed and 800cc of urine drained. Foley was removed
and patient was voiding spontaneously prior to discharge.

DM- type 2.  Patient controlled on insulin pump, A1
