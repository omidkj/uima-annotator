Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3326**]
Chief Complaint:
Altered mental status, hypoxia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Tracheostomy and trach tube placement [**12-24**]


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 95403**] is an 87 yo man with a recent stroke with
persistent R near-hemiplegia s/p PEG placement, DM2, CKD
(baseline Cr 1.6-2) who presented from his nursing home today
minimally repsonsive.
.
Upon arrival to the ED, he remained minimally responsive and was
intubated for airway protection. His initial VSs were 98.1, 84,
96/53, 80, 94%. A CXR demonstrated a questionable new opacity at
the right base. A U/A was suggestive of UTI, and he was covered
broadly for both UTI and PNA with vancomycin, ceftazadime and
levofloxacin. A central line was placed.
.
No further history was available. Among the pt's outside records
were lab reports indicating that his Cr was 2.1 on [**12-9**] and had
risen to 4.2 on [**12-11**].

RECENT STUDIES
[**12-26**] Chest x-ray
FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of [**12-24**], the patient has
taken a much better inspiration.  The opacification at the right
base almost completely cleared and the hemidiaphragm is sharply
seen.  Mild increased opacification persists at the left base.
The cardiac silhouette remains somewhat enlarged and there is
indistinctness of pulmonary vessels that could be a
manifestation of vascular congestion.
.
Tracheostomy tube and PICC line remain in place.

MICROBIOLOGY: C diff toxin +

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 87 yo man with recent stroke with persistent
near-hemiplegia and PEG placement, DM2, CKD presents from NH
with delirium, acute renal failure, ? PNA and ? UTI.
.
# Hypoxemic respiratory failure: Mr [**Known lastname 95403**] was intubated for
airway protection and hypoxemia on arrival. His x-ray was read
as a possible right lower lobe pneumonia, and then evolved with
perihilar opacities. He was started on levofloxacin, ceftazidime
and vancomycin to treat a healthcare-associated pneumonia (given
recent nursing home residence) and possible UTI. By the 12th
(day [**2-4**]) his x-ray was no longer showing a clear opacity, but
he remained ventilator dependent with copious oral and pulmonary
secretions. He was titrated down to FiO2 of 0.40, pressure
support of 10 and PEEP of 5 by the 14th, and has been on these
settings since then.
.
Despite multiple spontaneous breathing trials, his RSBI never
declined to a level in which extubation appeared reasonable.
Accordingly, after discussion with his family, he had a bedside
tracheostomy on [**12-24**] and was on a trach tube thereafter; still,
his vent settings remained the same and he remained unable to
tolerate spontaneous breathing trials. In the last two days of
his admission we started 4x/daily trach mask trials for 20-30
minutes as tolerated in order to see whether this would help his
pulmonary condition. We also began to more aggressively diurese
him (see below) which appeared to help resolve edema seen on his
x-ray although his clinical condition did not change
substantially in the short term. Hopefully with further diuresis
he can wean from the vent as there is no clear other reason he
should not be able to.
.
# C. difficile infection. On the night before discharge, Mr
[**Name13 (STitle) 95404**] was noted to have foul-smelling mucoid stool, and C.
diff was sent. This returned positive, and flagyl was started.
This was likely caught very early in the infection, which was
most likely secondary to C. diff regrowth soon after the
discontinuation of his 14 day course of levo/ceftaz/vanco for
pneumonia, which had likely depleted much of his normal flora.
[**12-26**] is day 1 of 14 for treatment of this.
.
# Altered mental status: He was lethargic and unresponsive on
arrival. We considered several possible etiologies including
toxic/metabolic encephalopathy, uremia, hypernatremia, PNA, UTI,
and meningitis. His BUN was remarkably high (baseline at last
d/c was 20), though he had no pericardial rub on exam.
Hypernatremia likely [**1-4**] volume depletion. His neck was supple
on exam. A CT head was negative for new processes although it
did show an old pontine infarct. A clear etiology was not
identified since his infection and hypernatremia were both
treated in the first days of his admission; his mental status
appeared to clear somewhat although it was difficult to tell
(particularly in the setting of requiring mechanical
ventilation) what his baseline was and whether he had returned
to it. He had some clearly lucid periods in which he was able to
shake his head or nod in response to questions and even
occasionally to attempt to mouth words, though on the day of
discharge he was arousable and tracked and registered his
examiners but did not clearly answer questions. (He had received
a one-time dose of ativan in the night prior.) Whether he might
continue to have improvement as other aspects of his health
improve is not clear. We would suggest low-dose Haldol if his
agitation continues. We have been attempting to avoid sedation
in order to try to work further towards weaning from the vent.
