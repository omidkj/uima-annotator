Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 458**]
Chief Complaint:
Lightheadedness

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
placement of a [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Male First Name (un) 923**] [**Male First Name (un) 8997**] [**Male First Name (un) **] pacemaker


History of Present Illness:
This is a [**Age over 90 **] year old female with a past medical history of
hypertension, dCHF, and hyperlipidemia who presents with one day
of lightheadedness. She noted onset of her symptoms this morning
in the bathroom with sudden onset of short episodes of
lightheadedness. She  has never had something like it. She did
note some palpitations after she felt the episodes of
lightheadedness and some ankle edema starting yesterday. She
denies any chest pain, SOB, abd. pain, N/V/D, diaphoresis. She
has felt faint but has not lost consciousness. EMS was called
via Lifeline and noted on arrival that her heart rate varied
from 30-130 with ?a.fib/flutter on the strip.
.
On review of systems, she denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. She denies recent fevers, chills or
rigors. She denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the
other review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, or
syncope.
.
In the ED, initial vitals were 97.8, 140, 140/110, 30, 100% NRB.
She was noted to have a variable heart rate, mostly an irregular
narrow complex tachycardia to 130s with long conversion pauses
of up to 6 seconds with some brief intervals of NSR (4-6 beats).
During the sinus pauses, she had symptoms of lightheadedness and
abdominal flushing.  She also developed bursts of a stable wide
complex tachycardia, thought to be abberancy. She received 2gm
of calcium gluconate empirically. She then received 5mg IV
metoprolol with little effect on her heart rate. She was prepped
for a temporary pacer wire and the introducer was placed in the
ED. She remained HD stable. Shortly after the introducer
placement she switched to atrial bigeminy at a rate around 70.
She is transferred to the CCU for further management.

ECG [**11-2**]:
Supraventricular tachycardia, which may be atrial flutter, is
new as compared with previous tracing of [**2115-3-14**].
.
ECG [**11-3**]:
Sinus rhythm. Left atrial abnormality. Delayed precordial R wave
transition. Compared to the previous tracing of [**2115-11-2**] sinus
rhythm has appeared.
.
ECG [**11-4**]:
Sinus rhythm followed by a premature atrial contraction,
followed by what looks like an episode of atrial tachycardia
with 2:1 conduction. Delayed precordial R wave transition which
may be due to lead placement. Compared to the previous tracing
of [**2115-11-3**] atrial tachycardia is now present.
.
[**11-2**] CXR:
Mild-to-moderate cardiomegaly is unchanged. Right IJ catheter
tip is seen in the right brachiocephalic vein. There is no
evidence of pneumothorax or
pleural effusion. The lungs are grossly clear. The aorta is
tortuous.
.
[**11-5**] CXR:
As compared to the previous examination, there is no relevant
change. Unchanged position of the leads, unchanged coarse,
unchanged left
pectoral position of the pacemaker device. Unchanged minimal
left suprabasal atelectasis. No evidence of pneumothorax.
.
MRSA SCREEN (Final [**2115-11-5**]): POSITIVE FOR METHICILLIN RESISTANT
STAPH AUREUS.
.

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a [**Age over 90 **] year old female with a history of hypertension,
diastolic CHF who presents with new onset tachyarrhythmia with
long conversion pauses.
.
# Tachycardia: In the ED, tachycardia and then with long
conversion pauses. Unclear if this was a.fib/flutter with
abberancy vs. another SVT. Long conversion pauses concerning for
tachy-brady syndrome; and presyncope. Remained hemodynamically
stable. No signs of ischemic cause, likely age related
conduction degradation in setting of dCHF. Stable in atrial
bigeminy when came to the CCU. Patient had Cordis placed in ED,
and we were prepared to float temporary pacer wire if became
tachycardic and unstable, to manage pauses/bradycardia, but this
never was the case. Pacer pads remained in place in the CCU.
Patient rate controlled with 25mg po metoprolol TID (home
medication).
For this arhythmia, patient had a pacemaker placed by the EP
service on [**2115-11-4**] - St. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 923**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 35095**] DR [**Last Name (STitle) **]
pacemaker. Patient was on heparin gtt for prophylaxis given
underlying afib/flutter concern (Guiac negative), and was
discharged on coumadin. Patient to be on antibiotics (keflex)
for 48 hours post-procedure. Patient to be on amiodarone for
treatment of atrial tachycardia. Procedure was without
complications - no hematoma, no complications on CXR.
