started on 1 gm Vancomycin and 4.5 gm Zosyn for presumed
aspiration pneumonia. She was also started on nitroglycerin drip
for HTN and given 60 mg IV Lasix. She had minimal response to
the 60 mg IV lasix and she was placed on bipap.

Studies:
CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2108-2-14**] 4:34 PM
FINDINGS: There are low lung volumes. Cephalization and
prominence of the
vasculature is present however no overt pulmonary edema is seen.
Denser
consolidation at the bases likely represents atelectasis;
however,
infection/consolidation cannot be excluded. No pneumothorax is
seen. Trace
pleural effusion on the right may be present. There is mild
cardiomegaly.
The aorta is tortuous.

ECG Study Date of [**2108-2-14**]  4:39:32 PM
Sinus rhythm. Borderline P-R interval prolongation. Consider
left atrial
abnormality. Left ventricular hypertrophy by voltage in lead aVL
with ST-T wave abnormalities, strain and/or myocardial ischemia.
Since the previous tracing of [**2107-12-15**] ST-T wave abnormalities
are difficult to compare because of differences in artifact.


Brief Hospital Course:
81 yo fem with multiple medical problems including HTN, DMII,
CVA (Pontine), vascular dementia, and recurrent UTIs who
presents from [**Hospital1 1501**] with acute onset of respiratory distress and
hypoxia in the setting of hypertensive urgency.

# Goals of Care: [**2108-2-16**] a family meeting conference call was
held with the primary team, palliative care, and multiple family
members including the HCP. The decision was made to make Ms.
[**Known lastname 95171**] CMO with the goals of care targeted towards comfort,
which would be consistent with her goals, based on her
prognosis. She currently has multiple medical issues.  We have
limited her tethers, and decreased vital signs to [**Hospital1 **]
(monitoring BP). We had been treating her bacteremia and
discontinued antibiotics prior to discharge (Coag negative
staph) to Hospice care. We treated her blood pressure for
comfort purposes, as well as allowed her to eat despite
aspiration risk, all with the goal of comfort in mind. She had
morphine 2-4mg IV available for dypnea or pain, though she did
not require any. We have arranged a proper medication list upon
