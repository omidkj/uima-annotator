History of Present Illness:
82yo Greek speaking male w/ hx of COPD, CHF, DM been having
increased cough, fevers, weakness, and worsening SOB over the
past few weeks. He was seen at the end of [**Month (only) 116**] in [**Hospital1 1474**] and
was treated for a COPD exacerbation with steriods. During the
first two weeks in [**Month (only) 205**] he would have fevers, increasing
weakness, and cough. He saw PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**8-13**] and treated him with IM
ceftriaxone and augmentin. The PCP ordered [**Name Initial (PRE) **] ct chest on [**8-15**]
due to concern about post-obstructive pneumonia. He defervesed
with the ceftriaxone, but the course of that finished and he
began having fevers again. He was restarted on the ceftriaxone
was told he had a double pneumnoia on [**8-24**]. He normally uses 3L
of NC at home 24 hours a day. His blood sugars have been
increasing recently since the steriod course in [**Month (only) 116**] with sugars
in the 4-500s, which is new for him as his A1C is typically in
the 6 range per the PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) **] started him on regular insulin and
10 of lanuts recently to deal with the blood sugars. He was
treated int he ED with vanc/ [**Last Name (un) **]/ and ceftriaxone and was given
3L of fluid. Originally he was hypoxic and tachypnic was put on
a venti mask, he was weaned to a 50% non rebreather. He was also
given tylenol for a fever of 101.5.

On arrival to the MICU, the patient is in NAD with slightly

Brief Hospital Course:
82yo Greek speaking male w/ hx of COPD on 3L NC, CHF, DM with
PNA that has been resistent to treatment over the past two weeks
per his PCP.

Acute Diagnoses
# Pneumonia / COPD
CXR shows mutiple inflitrates, febrile, no leukocytosis, history
of COPD on home oxygen, PCP says he had recurrent RML pneumonia,
also long smoking history of 90 pk/years. CT chest from [**Hospital1 **]
showed pneumonia and recs followup imaging for evaluation of any
underlaying pathology such as neoplasm causing recurrent PNA and
obstructive picture when pneumonia has resolved. While in the
MICU his pneumonia was treated with IV vancomycin and zosyn.
Nebulizers were used for COPD.  A speech and swallow consult was
requested during his admission for concern of aspiration risk.
Blood cx are pending at the time of discharge.

# DM
Elevated blood glucose while in the MICU. This was an issue
prior to admission and is likely related to both his infectious
process and the steriod course he was on prior to admission.
Both lantus and ISS were increased with good control.

# Rash in Groin
Nystatin was prescribed.

Chronic Diagnoses
# CHF
Appeared to be hypo/euvolemic.  Furosemide was continued.

# Neuropathy
Home gabapentin was continued.

# PUD
Home omeprazole was continued.

# HLD
Home simvastatin was continued.

Transitional Issues:
# Will need vascular follow up with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1391**] as well
as a follow up CXR to evaluate the resolution of his PNA and for
any underlaying pathology. He will also need home nursing to
follow his PICC line and for family education for the duration
of his IV antibiotics.
