Brief Hospital Course:
83F with juxtarenal AAA s/p EVAR ([**2140-7-25**]) complicated by
splenic infarct, retroperitoneal hematoma, renal insufficiency,
and bowel ischemia. Of note, preoperatively she had calcific
aortic stenosis distally and a right common iliac calcified
stenosis. Intraoperatively, the renal arteries were covered with
the endovascular stent to achieve an optimal seal.
Postoperatively, there was concern for mesenteric ischemia due
to persistent abdominal pain, however, no BRBPR. CTA on [**2140-7-25**]
demonstrated a new hyperdense left perinephric collection
tracking from a hyperdense hematoma abutting the EVAR graft,
approximately 1.7 cm inferior to bifurcation, concerning for a
graft leak. In addition, findings demonstrated a newly occluded
[**Female First Name (un) 899**] flow with early proximal reconstitution, although there were
no secondary signs of bowel ischemia. Sigmoidoscopy was
performed on [**2140-7-26**], which demonstrated relatively
normal-appearing sigmoid mucosa. Given that the renal arteries
were occluded, the patient was started on hemodialysis [**2140-7-26**],
and was expected to be on permanent hemodialysis
postoperatively. Throughout this time, she had persistent
abdominal pain. On [**2140-7-29**], she was triggered on the floor for
mental status changes as well as tachypnea/respiratory distress,
and was subsequently transferred to the ICU. She was intubated
and placed on pressors due to hypotension. Sigmoidoscopy was
repeated on [**2140-7-30**], which demonstrated normal mucosa.
Postoperatively, she had hct 25.9 - 33.0, wbc elevated to 24.3,
and lactate ranged from 0.6 - 2.2. She did receive pRBC
tranfusion. On [**2140-7-31**], the patient developed an increasing
pressor requirement and rapid atrial fibrillation. After
extensive discussion with her family, she was taken to the
operating room with Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **], underwent exploratory
laparotomy, and found to have patchy ischemia of the small
intestine in addition to full thickness necrosis of the left /
sigmoid colon. Findings were discussed with the family, and a
decision was made not to resect any bowel or perform a
colostomy. The patient returned to the CVICU intubated, on
pressors, and was subsequently made CMO following arrival of her
family. The ICU team met with the family regarding prognosis,
and Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **] spoke with the family. Following these
discussions, the patient was placed on a morphine drip, the
pressors were discontinued, and she was extubated. She expired
and was pronounced dead at 3:53pm. She stopped breathing and
asystole occurred; an examination was performed to confirm
death. The organ bank, admissions office, medical examiner, the
ICU (Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 5856**] and vascular surgery attending (Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **] were
notified. The medical examiner accepted the case. The report of
death was completed and brought to the admission office. The
family refused an autopsy.
