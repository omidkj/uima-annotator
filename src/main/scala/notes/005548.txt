Service:

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 78-year-old man
with no cardiac symptoms who was evaluated for a lip
resection and had a positive stress test preoperatively.
Catheterization after the post stress test showed severe left
main and three-vessel disease.  He also had the recent onset
of atrial fibrillation.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant only for lip carcinoma.

ALLERGIES:  NO KNOWN DRUG ALLERGIES.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Aspirin 81 mg q.d.

LABORATORY DATA:  Prior to admission white count was 8.0,
hematocrit 49.1, platelet count 387; potassium 4.0, BUN 11,
creatinine 0.9, blood sugar 108.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  General:  The patient was a pleasant,
comfortable, chronically ill-appearing gentleman in no acute
distress.  Vital signs:  Heart rate 64, blood pressure
187/68, respirations 22, oxygen saturation 97% on room air.
Lungs:  Breath sounds diminished in the right lower lobe.
Heart:  Irregularly irregular.  No murmurs.  Abdomen:  Soft,
nontender, nondistended.  Positive bowel sounds.  No
hepatosplenomegaly.  Carotids:  Bilateral soft bruit.
Extremities:  Warm and without edema.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Following admission, the patient was
brought to the Cardiac Catheterization Lab where he underwent
catheterization which showed severe left main and
three-vessel disease.  He tolerated the procedure well.
Please see the catheterization report for full details.

Following catheterization, the patient was discharged home.
He returned to [**Hospital6 256**] on [**7-19**]
where he was admitted directly to the Operating Room.  In the
Operating Room, he underwent coronary artery bypass grafting
times two.  Please see operative report for full details.  In
summary the patient had an off-pump coronary artery bypass
graft times two with a LIMA to the left anterior descending,
and a saphenous vein graft to the LIMA and then to the right
coronary artery.  His aorta was severely calcific.  He was
transferred from the Operating Room to the Cardiothoracic
Intensive Care Unit.  At the time of transfer, he had
epinephrine, Neo-Synephrine, and Propofol infusion.  He did
well in the immediate postoperative period.  He was weaned
off his cardioactive drugs.  His anesthesia was reversed.  He
was weaned from the ventilator and successfully extubated.

He remained in the Intensive Care Unit on postoperative day
#1.  At that time, he was started on Plavix.  Hemodynamically
he was stable.  He remained in the Intensive Care Unit
throughout postoperative day #1.  On postoperative day #2, he
was brought to the Cardiac Catheterization Lab where he
underwent PTCA.  Please see catheterization report for full
details.  In summary, the patient had an angioplasty to his
ramus and to the left circumflex with stent placement times
one to the ramus and stent times two to the left circumflex.
Following angioplasty, the patient was returned to the
Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit.

Also on postoperative day #2, the patient was noted to have
atrial fibrillation.  He was started on Amiodarone drip
following which he converted to normal sinus rhythm.  The
patient remained in the Intensive Care Unit for several
additional days due to difficulty clearing pulmonary
secretions.  A sputum culture at that time showed
gram-negative rods consistent with Hemophilus.  Chest x-ray
showed no congestive heart failure and a questionable left
lower lobe pneumonia.  At that time, he was begun on
Levofloxacin, as well as Albuterol, Atrovent, and Mucomyst
nebulizers.

On postoperative day #6, the patient was finally considered
to be stable and ready to be transferred to
................... for continuing postoperative care and
cardiac rehabilitation.  At that time, he remained
hemodynamically stable.  In addition to being followed by the
Cardiothoracic Surgery Service, he was also seen by
Cardiology and the [**Hospital **] Clinic for assistance with diabetes
management.

Once on the floor with the assistance of Physical Therapy and
the nursing staff, the patient's activity level was increased
on a daily basis.  The patient continued to require
aggressive pulmonary toilet in order to clear his secretions,
and he continued to have a high oxygen requirement.

On postoperative day #10, the patient's Levofloxacin was
discontinued.  He remained hemodynamically stable.  His
pulmonary status continued to slowly improve, and by
postoperative day #13, it was decided that the patient was
stable and ready to be transferred to rehabilitation for
continuing postoperative care and cardiac rehabilitation.

At the time of transfer, the patient's condition is stable.
