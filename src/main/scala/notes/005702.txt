Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Aspirin / Atenolol

Attending:[**Doctor First Name 2080**]
Chief Complaint:
Fever

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
ERCP
Central line placement in right internal jugular vein

History of Present Illness:
This is a 66-year-old female with a pmhx. of recurrent
cholangitis, cholecestectomy, and hypertension who presented to
the ED with 4 days of subjective fever, upper abdominal pain.
Seen by PCP on day prior to admission with reported elevated
LFT's, sent to ER when pain has persisted.  Endorses subjective
fever and chills for the last 4 days and decreased PO intake.
Says that pain is worse after urination and feels similar to
previous episodes of cholangitis.  In [**2171**] patient had an ERCP
with sphincterotomy and stone removal and subsequent laproscopic
cholecystectomy. She has had colangitis in [**2171**] which was
treated with biliary stenting x2 and removal of stone and
sludge.
.
In the ED, initial vs were: 100.6 (T max in ED: 101.6), 108,
128/52, 17, 97. Labs were notable for ALT/AST of 426/768, AP of
205, LDH of 649, T. bili of 2.4, and a lactat of 1.8.  An
abdominal ultra-sound showed intra and extra hepatic ductal
dilitation with patent vasculature -- no acute process.  A CXR
showed cardiomegaly and question of LLL atelectasis.  ERCP is
aware of the patient but is not sure if she needs another ERCP
given previous sphyncterotomies.  Patient was given tylenol and
zosyn. UA and UCx were sent.  She was initially going to
medicine but acutely became hypotensive and hypoxic (88/40 and
88% respectivly).  Her blood pressure improved to the low 100s
with 3L fluids.  A central line was placed.  Durring the central
line placement the patient became very short of breath.  The
line was not sutured but a sterile dressing placeed.  A CXR
revealed pulm congenstion.  She was started on BiPAP.  She was
given nitro gtt, morphine 2mg iv x1, and lasix 10mg. With the
medications she was able to transition from BiPAP to 100% FM and
her oxygen saturaion was 99%.
.
On the floor, patient is alert and oriented, in no acute
distress. Satting 95% on 5L.  Denies abdominal pain and states
that breathing has improved.

Pertinent Results:
ERCP [**2174-6-20**]

Evidence of a previous sphincterotomy was noted in the major
papilla.
The sphincterotomy was widely patent.  Cannulation of the
biliary duct was successful.  A single 20 mm round  obstructing
stone was seen at the lower third of the common bile duct.
There was severe post-obstructive dilation with the CBD
measuring 20mm.  An Olympus lithotriptor was inroduced to
perform lithotripsy.  The stone broke up immediately and was
removed in pieces with the lithotriptor.  The stone was soft and
easily broken up.
The duct was swept to clearance with a large [**Location (un) **]-cook
balloon.  The balloon passed through the CBD at 20mm diameter
without any difficulty.

CT Abd [**2174-6-21**]:

1. Moderate-sized bilateral pleural effusions, with compressive
atelectasis.
2. Extensive pneumobilia, with dilatation of the CBD and reflux
of oral
contrast, compatible with recent history of
sphincterotomy/lithotripsy. No
free air is detected.
3. Normal-appearing pancreas, with no evidence of pancreatic
ductal
dilatation.

TTE [**2174-6-22**]
The left atrial volume is severely increased. The right atrium
is moderately dilated. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity
size, and global systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. The mitral valve shows characteristic
rheumatic deformity. There is moderate thickening of the mitral
valve chordae. There is moderate valvular mitral stenosis (area
1.0-1.5cm2). Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to
acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may be
significantly UNDERestimated.] The tricuspid valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. The
main pulmonary artery is dilated. There is a small pericardial
effusion

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 66-year-old woman with a history of recurrent
colangitis, cholecystectomy, HTN, hyperlipidemia, now with
abdominal pain, fever, and chills, who presents to the ED from
her PMD's office with elevated LFTs.
.
SIRS/SEPSIS secondary to cholangitis:  Ms. [**Known lastname **] presents with a
picture concerning for SIRS/Sepsis in the setting of hypotension
(SBPs in the 80s), tachycardia, and elevated white count.
Likely source of infection is in the biliary tree.  In the ED,
patient was given zosyn, aggressive IV fluid hydration, and a
central line was placed.  A RUQ ultrasound was done, which
showed intrahepatic biliary dilatation, not significantly
changed from prior.  In the ICU, zosyn was continued, MAPs were
kept >60, urine output was monitored, and CVP was kept between
[**9-8**].  Patient briefly required low-dose pressors overnight on
[**6-20**] however, these were quickly weaned.  Upon transfer to the
floor, patient was afebrile with stable vitals.  She was
transitioned to Levofloxacin successfully.  She was discharged
to complete a 10 day course of antibiotics.
.
# ELEVATED LFTs:   Complicated biliary history with multiple
ERCP and stents, history of sphincterotomy and history of lap
[**Doctor Last Name **].  On this admission, patient's elevated LFTs were
consistent with a cholestatic picture; RUQ showed intrahepatic
biliary dilatation though picture was not much changed from
prior.  Ms. [**Known lastname **] was taken for ERCP on [**6-20**]; a 20mm round stone
was seen obstructing the lower third of the CBD and liptotripsy
was performed.  Patient had some post ERCP pain, which resolved
on day one.  ERCP suggested continuing IV antibiotics for 48
hours and PO antibiotics for 10 days post-procedure.  Her LFTs
transitioned towards normal by discharge.  Ursodiol was also
started to facilitate biliary drainage.
- She will have her LFTs repeated within 1 week from discharge
to ensure resolution.
.
# Acute diastolic CHF/RESPIRATORY DISTRESS secondary to flash
pulmonary edema:  Ms. [**Known lastname **] was aggressively volume resuscitated
in the ED with 4L of IVF; in the setting of so much fluid and
moderate mitral stenosis, she developed flash pulmonary edema.
