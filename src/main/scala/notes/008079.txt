HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS/HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient is
an 80 year old male who reports his only medical history as
borderline elevated blood sugar, presenting status post a
fall.  The fall was unwitnessed and the patient was found by
his son after being down up to eight hours.  The son notes
that the house was extremely hot when he found his father.

The patient was confused but apparently at his baseline
mental status at presentation.  The patient was unable to
provide a reliable history of the circumstances surrounding
the fall, however, the son reports that the patient is status
post bilateral knee replacement and has chronic foot pain
which has been worsening and, because of this, the patient
has had an increasingly difficult time walking.

The patient's physical examination, vital signs and
laboratory data were unremarkable at the time of
presentation.  Physical therapy was consulted to assess the
patient and it was found that the patient could only ambulate
two steps and had balance difficulties.

During hospital day number two, the patient's mental status
began to decline, with increasing confusion, incoherent
mumbling and yelling.  A head CT scan and serum drug screen
were both negative.  At this time, the patient was only
receiving intravenous fluids for hydration.  Risperdal 0.5 mg
times one was given for agitation, without effect.

On hospital day number four, the patient developed a
sustained tachycardia in the 140s and was breathing at a rate
of 40 per minute.  It was also noted on this day that the
patient's white blood cell count had elevated to 12.8 and his
temperature elevated to 100.8.  The patient's blood pressure
and oxygen saturation remained stable.  At this time, a chest
x-ray was negative and CT angiography for a pulmonary embolus
was negative.

Intravenous Adenosine 6 mg was pushed times one and was
successful in breaking the patient's supraventricular
tachycardia, bringing the rate down to the 90s.  The patient
was transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit, where his
dyspnea worsened, with a respiratory rate in the 60s per
minute.  The patient, at this time, was intubated.

A lumbar puncture was also performed, which was negative.
The patient's anion gap was found to be 17 with a bicarbonate
level of 18.  Urinalysis revealed moderate ketones and serum
acetone was moderate.  The patient's blood sugars ranged from
the 120s to the 170s and never rose above this level.  His
CPK rose to 1,133 with a negative MB fraction and negative
troponin.

The patient was treated with diabetic ketoacidosis with
intravenous fluids and an insulin drip.  Increased secretions
were noted while the patient was intubated, and sputum
culture was positive for Hemophilus influenzae.  The patient
was subsequently started on Levaquin.

The patient's respiratory status improved and he was
extubated on hospital day number five.  Diabetic ketoacidosis
resolved with treatment.  The patient remained hypertensive
and had occasional runs of supraventricular tachycardia, both
of which responded to Lopressor.

The patient was called out to the floor on hospital day
number eight, where he continued to receive tube feeds of
ProMod with fiber through a nasogastric tube.  He remained
stable and his blood sugars remained well controlled.

The patient was seen by speech pathology and underwent a
modified barium swallow.  Recommendations are for maintenance
of a soft solid diet with nectar thick liquids.  The
patient's diet was advanced as such and tolerated well.
