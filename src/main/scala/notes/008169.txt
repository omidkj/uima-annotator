History of Present Illness:
52 yo male with Down's syndrome and NAFLD who presented to ED
with two weeks of intermittent facial rash, BLE petechial rash
and one day of fevers. Pt has been complaining of not feeling
well over the past few weeks and has been c/o of stomach pain.
Sister states that she gave him an OTC [**Doctor Last Name 360**] (can't remember the
name) and he developed a macular rash on his face, transiently.
He saw his PCP ~5 days PTA and was given a prescription for an
anti-spasmodic elixer for his abdominal pain. His sister was
concerned about his facial rash so she took him to the doctor
two days ago and was given a prescription for acular eyedrops
and benadryl. Yesterday he developed a diffuse, confluent red
rash on his trunk, "like sunburn" that was pruritic. He was
treated with sarna lotion and cortisone creams. His rash then
spread to his lower extremities,where it appeared petechial in
nature. His sister notes that he had temps to [**Age over 90 **] yesterday. He
had some nausea but no diarrhea or emesis. She thinks he may
have been c/o a sore throat. He was brought to the ER for
further evaluation.
.
In the ER the patient was initially observed and was apparently
non-compliant with his exam. His WBC returned at 30.6, lactate
4.6 and patient was noted to be afebrile, tachycardic and
normotensive. He had an abdominal CT (non-contrast) that showed
some stranding surrounding the aorta, IVC and left renal
vessels. He was given
ceftazidime, vancomycin and 1 gm ceftriaxone. CXR showed mild
pulm edema but no PNA and UA was negative. he was admitted to
the ICU due to the elevated lactate and leukocytosis.
.
In the MICU, ID and dermatology were consulted. He was given
vanc and ceftriaxone to cover for meningococus and GPCs, doxy to
cover rickettsial dz and flagyl given the abd complaints. Pt
improved symptomatically, defervesced and his rash faded. He was
uncooperative with exams and refused all bld draws.
.
On arrival to the floor, pt has no complaints but is very
difficult to communicate with. pt's sister states he has been
coughing more and when he coughs his heart rate increases. he
started coughing while in the hospital. he likes the atrovent
nebs and wants more. she states his rash has improved
dramatically. no recent travel. sick contacts include a nurse
whoe helps out at home who has been sick with ?flu (but was not
coughing, and no rash). no hx of asthma

Derm exam on admit:
-On face: greasy scales w mild erythema on sebhorreic
distribution
faint erythema on cheeks
-Diffuse erythematous morbilliform eruption on chest, arms,
legs, with tiny blanchable papules on arms. On b/l shin evidence
of slightly raised erythematous papules and petechiae, no
evidence of the palpable purpura that team described today. Not
able to examine palms and soles [**12-29**] to patient's incooperation.
No evidence of mucosal involvement, no target lesions, bullae,
vesicles.

Pertinent Results:
Abd CT:
1. Mild airspace opacity in left lower lobe which may reflect an
infective process in the correct clinical setting.
2. Slight stranding of the retroperitoneal fat, of uncertain and
doubtful clinical significance.
3. Left renal cyst.
4. Thickened bladder wall which may reflect neurogenic bladder.

Brief Hospital Course:
.
# Rash: The Ddx for this patient's rash was enormous when
combined with fever/leukocytosis. Rash started on his head and
spread down to his feet. facial and truncal rash was
maculopapular and the LE rash was a palpable purpuric rash. ID
and Derm saw patient and narrowed Ddx to leukoclastic
vasculitis, drug reaction, viral exanthem or HSP (though UA is
without rbc, wbc, casts or protein). Leukoclastic vasculitis
possible though complement levels are normal (usually low in
vasculitis). Cryoglobulins pending (if elevated, suggests type
III cryoglobulinemia seen with autoimmune d/o such as
leukoclastic vasculitis). Drug reaction possible though would
expect serum eos? Rapid improvement with abx suggests bacterial
etiology. The family will provide the patient's immunization
history. Down's patient's have higher incidences of ALL and
leukemic infiltrates are not out of the question given his
elevated WBC count. Rash significantly improved at discharge
with topical steroid creams and antibiotics, will follow-up with
PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**11-28**] weeks.
.
# ID: proposed to finish off a course of 7 days of Levo/Flagyl.
Of note, pts with down's syndrome are at increased risk of skin
infection and other skin disorders.
He was thus treated with levo/flagyl x 7 days (day 1 = [**11-20**]).
He was also treated with NSAIDs, antihistamines, as well as
benadryl q4-6h and/or atarax 25mg qhs for symptoms of pruritus
as well as Sarna liberally.
.
# Elevated lactate/leukocytosis/fevers: Elevated lactate in the
setting of fevers and tachycardia, suggested an early septic
picture. Abd CT had only nonspecific findings thought limited
study due to lack of contrast. CXR showed only pulm edema but
abd CT showed possible LLL opacity which could represent PNA. UA
negative. no wounds visible. when combined with rash, could be a
variety of infections. ?PNA now with this increased cough. These
findigs prompted brief admission to the MICU. Blood and urine
cultures were unrevealing. On HOD #3, lactate and WBC trending
down and the patient was clinically improved. He will complete a
course of levo/flagyl as an outpatient. Despite multiple
attempts prior to discharge additional labs were unable to be
obtained due to patient agitation. Given his marked improvement,
afebrile with stable vitals and no complaints, the patient was
stable for discharge home.
.
# Cough: new since admission. could be pneumonia (aspiration vs
CAP picked up just before admission), no asthma hx. did not
progress and improved with albuterol nebs and tessla perles.
.
# Tachycardia: sinus tach that responds to fluid boluses
suggested hypovolemia. Pt also gets anxious with coughing.  By
the time he reached the floor, he was +5.6L for his LOS. As
such, patien
