Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 618**]
Chief Complaint:
ICH

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
The patient is a [**Age over 90 **] year old woman with recent admission [**4-24**] to
[**2144-5-13**] for left fronto-temporo-parietal hemorrhage, atrial
fibrillation, hypertension, status post pacemaker, who presents
as a transfer from [**Location (un) 620**] after fall at her [**Hospital1 1501**].

She was unable to give a history, so history obtained from
records and from discussion with her nephew. [**Name (NI) **] was
previously a very healthy and active [**Age over 90 **] year old and independent
in all activities of daily living. [**2144-4-24**] she had sudden onset
of garbled speech. She was admitted at [**Hospital1 112**] and family told she
had a small left temporo-parietal hemorrhage. They do not
believe she had any significant weakness. She was breathing on
her own. She remained aphasic throughout her admission there and
was transferred to [**Hospital1 1501**] yesterday.

At 4:30 am, she was found down. Not clear if due to fall,
seizure, etc. Her Cspine was cleared clinically be doctor [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 1501**]
and she was sent to [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] for head CT.

Head CT showed a 4x3 cm left temporoparietal hemorrhage with
midline shift of 5mm and significant mass effect. She was
hypertensive at [**Location (un) 620**] to 187/94 and reportedly received
Diltiazem and perhaps Labetalol. As her med list included
Lovenox, she was given 1 unit FFP. She was intubated.  She was
then transferred here.

On arrival here, she was seen by trauma team out of concern for
fall. CXR and pelvic films no fracture and negative FAST exam.
She was given Protamine.

1. Intracranial hemorrhage [**2144-4-24**], treated at [**Hospital1 3372**]
2. Atrial fibrillation

Social History:
Previously lived independently. Managed own finances. Walked
unassisted. DNR per nephew, her closest relative, [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) 43972**]

drug use. They are in process of handing over her guardianship
to a court appointed guardian, but for right now, her nephew is
temporary guardian.

Head CT [**5-15**]:
Unchanged 4 cm left temporoparietal hemorrhage. Differential
includes amyloid angiopathy, underlying mass, anticoagulation,
and trauma. MRI for further evaluation can be performed.

Right-sided trans-subclavian right ventricular pacer lead in
standard placement. Tiny bilateral pleural effusion present. No
pneumothorax. ET tube in standard placement.

Brief Hospital Course:
She was taken to OSH ED where head CT showed hemorrhage, albeit
unclear if significantly changed from prior. She was intubated
and initial exam here with brainstem compressive signs with
sluggigh right pupil and depressed right corneal reflex. She
moved all extremities, but less so on the right, implying a
hemiparesis.
Given history and appearance, hemorrhages most likely due to
underlying amyloid angiopathy. After taking with physicians at
[**Hospital1 112**], it was not clear, and appeared
unlikely that any of her deficits were new.

She was admitted to the neuroICU and had serial head CTs which
showed unchanged hemorrhage and no herniation or brainstem
compression.  She was unable to get an MRI.  We then did an EEG
which showed PLEDs, thought to be evidence of her underlying
bleed and not a result of seizure activity.  Regardless, she was
continued on dilantin with therapeutic levels for ~7 days. This
was then discontinued as she had no evidence of seizure
clinically.  Repeat EEG on [**5-28**] shoed no evidence of
epileptiform discharges. She had all sedation held for 2 weeks
in the ICU and did not show any significant
recvoery/improvement.  She was tried on glycerol for possible
osmotic effect without change.  She did eventually open her eyes
spontaneously, but would not track objects and did not interact
with her surroundings.  She had no movement of her RUE and
minimal movement to pain of her RLE.  She did move her left side
to stimulation.  She was briefly CMO. After transfer to the
floor, she was more awake, though not following commands. CMO
status was reversed and medical treatment was quickly
reinstituted.

She had several fevers while in the ICU, but no cultures or UAs
returned pathologic.  She did have OP flora in her sputum at one
point.  Serial CXRs showed no sign of PNA in the
