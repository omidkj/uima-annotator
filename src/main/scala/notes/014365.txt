and weak. He was dialysed 5 times in the past 1 week as patient
had gained around 9 kg. He also noted to have diarrhea,
decreased PO intake. He also complained of left flank pain for
the last 1-2 weeks. On the morning od admission, he felt really
weak and slumped to the ground. His daughter checked his BP
which was SBP of 30's. He was immediately taken to [**Location (un) **]. In
the EMS, his SBP was in 60's. At [**Location (un) **], he got Fluid boluses
and was started on pressors. They tried SCL but were not
successful. He was then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further
management. In the ED, he got a fem line (under sterile
precautions) and was started intially on Neo and then switched
to Levo. His UA was dirty, he had leukocytosis and elevated CKs.
He also received Vanc, Cefepime.

.
EKG: Aflutter with 4:1 block, no acute ST-T wave changes
.
Chest Xray: Overall improvement in the congestive heart failure
seen in early [**Month (only) 216**].  Likely there is still a mild degree of
pulmonary edema.  Stable appearance to the mediastinum.
.
LUE U/S [**2128-1-19**]:
1.  Nonvisualization of left upper extremity veins with multiple
collateral vessels identified, suggestive of a chronic
obstruction.  This can be further evaluated with an MR
examination.
2.  No evidence of deep venous thrombosis in the right upper
extremity.
3.  Fistula graft within the left forearm which is widely
patent, however, it appears to be anastomosed to arterial
vessels.  No venous flow is noted within the region of the
fistula graft anastomoses.
.
Echo [**2128-1-22**]:
1.The left atrium is mildly dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated.
2.There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. [Intrinsic left ventricular
systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of
valvular regurgitation.] Left ventricular systolic function is
hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
3. Right ventricular chamber size is normal.
4.A bioprosthetic aortic valve prosthesis is present. The aortic
prosthesis appears well seated, with normal leaflet/disc motion
and transvalvular gradients. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
[The amount of regurgitation present is normal for this
prosthetic aortic valve.]
5. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is
severe mitral annular calcification. Moderate to severe (3+)
mitral regurgitation is seen.
6. Severe [4+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is mild
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
7.There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the findings of the prior report (images
unavailable for review) of [**2128-8-25**], the MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 28495**]
significantly. An accurate assessment of the aorta could not be
made on the present study.
.
[**1-24**] Fistulography L arm: Angiography of the arterialized L
brachial vein showed an occluded L subclavian vein. The L
subclavian vein was  occluded. The procedure was abandoned in
favor of surgical intervention.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. thrombosed L AV fistula
2. occluded L subclavian vein
.
[**1-25**] HD catheter exchange by IR: Uneventful exchange of right IJ
dialysis catheter, as above.  The tip of the catheter, which was
removed, was sent for cultures.  The line is ready to use.
.
[**1-27**] Left fistula ligation without any major complications.


Brief Hospital Course:
76 yo M with ESRD on HD, CAD, AAA repair, Aflutter, AVR, COPD
with hypotension from urosepsis vs overdialyzing, requiring MICU
stay. He was transiently on pressors. Broad spectrum antibiotics
were started in the ICU, as well as a Heparin gtt for Aflutter
and L UE clot. He was transferred to the floor with stable BP,
off pressors, on Vancomycin and Cefepime.
.
1) Hypotension: ? line sepsis vs. pneumonia vs hypovolemia [**2-18**]
aggressive HD and decreased PO intake. Cortstim test was
negative for adrenal insufficiency. Likely sources of infection
are HD catheter, PNA, less likely urine. Off Levophed gtt after
24h, BP was stable, then transferred to floor. Patient received
IV fluids as needed. Vancomycin (started [**1-19**]) and Cefepime
(started [**1-17**]) were continued. A total course of 21 days should
be given. Multiple blood and urine cultures from [**1-17**] through [**1-19**]
came back negative. HD catheter cultures were sent off on [**1-25**]
and also came back negative. Pt was hemodynamically stable on
discharge and afebrile.
.
2) CAD s/ CABG: Pt developed elevation of troponin to 0.3 (from
0.14 from [**August 2128**]), CPK elevated to 1598 although no elevation of
CK-MD index. EKG no evidence of any acute ST-T wave changes.
This could represent demand ischemia in the setting of sepsis,
hypotension. Cardiac enzymes were cycled x3 and remained stable.
Pt was continued on Lipitor. ASA was held on Heparin gtt. Pt was
continued on toprol XL with holding parameters once his blood
pressure was stable after transfer from the ICU. An Echo from
[**1-21**] to assess LV function showed EF of 75%, but [**Month/Day (1) 28495**] MR. [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]p appointment with cardiologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] should be
scheduled for 1-2 weeks after discharge.
.
3) Atrial flutter: His rate was controlled in 4:1 bloc. It was
therefore unlikely that this was contributing to the
hypotension. Pt was continued on his BB. Anticoagulation was
started. A heparin gtt was initiated which was discontinued
shortly pior discharge since he went for an AV fistula ligation.
He also developed guaiac positive stools on two occasions during
his hospital stay. The first time, the heparin gtt has been held
transiently (see below). The second time, Coumadin was just
started at 3mg qHS and was held as well for guaiac positive
stools. A hematocrit should be checked at rehab. It should be
decided after further Hematocrits whether anticoagulation with
Coumadin is being continued as an outpatient.
.
4) L UE clot: Present since fistula operation in [**11-22**]. The
patient was on a heparin gtt for the majority of his hospital
stay. However, the drip has been
