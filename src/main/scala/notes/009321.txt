Admission Date:  [**2127-1-8**]       Discharge Date:  [**2127-1-22**]

Date of Birth:   [**2106-3-24**]       Sex:  M

Service:
TRANSFERRED FROM MICU ON [**2127-1-22**].

ALLERGIES:  CEFTRIONE ALLERGY, POSSIBLE ANAPHYLAXIS.

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Respiratory distress and sepsis.
HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 20-year-old
Caucasian male with no past medical history, who was
medflighted from [**Hospital3 26615**] Hospital after intubation for
acute respiratory failure.

The patient had been in his usual state of health until three to
four days prior to admission, when he began to have flu-like
symptoms, including myalgias, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, and
watery diarrhea.  He was seen by his primary care physician, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **].
[**Last Name (STitle) 39128**] one day prior to admission.  At that time, assessment was
possible GI viral illness and he was given two liters normal
saline for hypotension.  That night, he
had a syncopal event while talking to his family on the phone.
The following afternoon he presented to the emergency
department at [**Hospital3 26615**] Hospital for sore throat, cough,
and increasing shortness of breath.  Chest x-ray at [**Hospital3 26616**] Hospital showed bilateral infiltrates and he was given
one gram IV Ceftriaxone and 250 mg Azithromycin for presumed
pneumonia.  At that time, temperature was 97.0, blood
pressure 95/65, heart rate 137, room air saturation was 89%. Mr.
[**Known lastname 26442**] became increasingly dyspneic with increasing respiratory
rate, decreasing oxygen saturation requiring 100%
nonrebreather.  He was intubated for acute respiratory failure.

LABORATORY DATA:  Significant labs from the outside hospital
included a white count of 14.2, with 95% neutrophils,
platelet count 75,000, INR 1.4, PT 13.4, creatinine 4.8, BUN
64, and CK 1175 with MB fraction of 8%.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was then transferred to [**Hospital1 1444**] for further management.  In
the emergency department, the patient was febrile with blood
pressure 130/67, heart rate 150s.  He was given 2 liters
normal saline, one gram of Vancomycin and the femoral line
was emergently placed into the right groin.  At this time, he
was transferred to the MICU.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Examination on administered revealed
the following:  The patient was comfortable, sedated,
intubated, moving all extremities spontaneously.  HEENT:
pupils small, 2-mm, but reactive.  Posterior oropharynx could
not be assessed secondary to the tube.  Neck was supple.  No
JVD.  No lymphadenopathy.  HEART:  Tachycardic, regular
rhythm, no rubs, murmurs, or gallops.  LUNGS:  Lungs were
clear to auscultation bilaterally.  ABDOMEN:  Soft,
nontender, nondistended, no hepatosplenomegaly.  EXTREMITIES:
Warm, clean, dry, and intact.  They were stiff and difficult
to move.  There was 1+ radial and DP pulses.  SKIN:  Mildly
erythematous, raised with blanching papillary rash over the
extremities and trunk.  There was no petechiae.  He had a few
purpuric lesions over his lower extremities.  NEUROLOGICAL:
The patient was moving all four extremities spontaneously
with mild decerebrate posturing of the upper extremities.  He
had stiff rigid extremities, 3+ reflexes at the biceps and
patella bilaterally.  Toes were downgoing bilaterally.

LABORATORY DATA:  Labs on admission revealed the following:
CBC showed a white count of 15.1, hematocrit 36.4, with
platelet count of 47.  Chem 7:  Sodium 134, potassium 4.1,
chloride 101, bicarbonate 19, BUN 63, creatinine 4.2, blood
sugar 155, ALT 23, AST 32, alkaline phosphatase 36, total
bilirubin 0.3, CK 1077, amylase 29, albumin 2.6, phosphatase
6.3, magnesium 1.4, calcium 5.2, PT 14.7, PTT 46.6, INR 1.5,
differential on the white count was 77% neutrophils, 10%
bands, 10% monos, 2% eosinophils.  Urine was significant for
3 to 5 white blood cells, 0 to 2 granulated casts, 0 to 2
hyaline casts.  Serum and urine toxic-metabolic panel was
negative.  Lactate was 4.1.  The ABG in the emergency
department revealed pH 7.18, pCO2 50, O2 200, ionized 0.84.
Chest x-ray in the emergency department showed a right lower
lobe consolidation.  Head CT showed no acute bleed, no
hydrocephalus, no significant opacifications of the left
sphenoid or maxillary sinus.  CT of the abdomen and chest
showed patchy bilateral infiltrates, consolidation of the
right lower lobe, but no hydronephrosis.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Upon arrival to the MICU, Mr. [**Known lastname 26442**]
[**Last Name (Titles) 1834**] lumbar puncture, which had 8 white blood cells, 77%
lymphocytes, 2% neutrophils, 21% monocytes.  A femoral arterial
line was also placed.

The MICU course is significant for the following:

PULMONARY:  Mr. [**Known lastname 26442**] was admitted in fulminant respiratory
failure with severe hypoxemic respiratory failure and poor
compliance.  Extensive adjustment of the ventilator including
multiple recruitment maneuvers, a PEEP of 20, paralytics and
proning was required to achieve PaO2s in the 60s on FiO2 of 1.0.
Pressure control ventilation was utilized with volumes of 6cc/kg
per the ARDSnet trial.  He was ventilated in the prone position
from [**1-8**] to [**1-11**] at which time enough margin was present to
place the patient back into the supine position.  He continued to
gradually improve and was finally extubated on [**2127-1-21**].

Mr. [**Known lastname 26442**] also [**Known lastname 1834**] two bronchoscopies during the MICU
stay.  The initial bronchoscopy was on [**2127-1-9**], which was
unremarkable with no significant sputum or clots.  This was
repeated approximately 2 to 3 days later after a desaturation
which revealed thick brown clots, which were suctioned out
successfully and sent for culture. Sputum cultures eventually
grew out Staphylococcus aureus, which was pansensitive.  He was
treated since admission with Vancomycin, as well as other
antibiotics, which will be detailed later for Staphylococcus
aureus pneumonia.

CARDIOVASCULAR:  Mr. [**Known lastname 26442**] maintained his blood pressure
until the morning of [**2127-1-8**]. At that time, blood pressure
began to decrease and he was placed on Levophed and
Vasopressin for blood pressure maintenance.  He was gradually
weaned off these pressors. Mr. [**Known lastname 26442**] was also tachycardiac
throughout his stay, secondary to fever, septic cardiomyopathy.
Echocardiogram was done on [**2127-1-19**], which showed EF of 15%
with bilateral ventricular dysfunction.  There were no
focal-wall abnormalities - therefore this was reflective of
sepsis related myocardial suppression. The echocardiogram was
repeated on [**2127-1-21**], which showed mild right ventricular
depression and dilatation, but left ventricular function was
within normal limits.

Mr. [**Known lastname 26442**] [**Last Name (Titles) 1834**] right heart catheterization on [**2127-1-8**].
Initial pulmonary artery pressure was 34/25 with the mean of 29,
wedge of 22, CVP of 20, heart output of 4.69, cardiac index of
2.88, SVR of 921, PVR of 119.  Over the next few days the SVR
decreased to 600 with increasing cardiac output likely secondary
to sepsis. He was placed on Dobutamine to increase cardiac output
with success.  The Dobutamine was finally discontinued
approximately two days after initiation.

FLUIDS, ELECTROLYTES, AND NUTRITION:  Mr. [**Known lastname 26442**] was NPO for
several days.  He placed for about five days on TPN and then
switched to tube feeds on [**2127-1-17**].  Tube feeds had been
tried before unsuccessfully secondary to poor gastric
motility.  High residuals were noted.

INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  Mr. [**Known lastname 26442**] was initially suspected to have
meningococcemia secondary to diffuse skin lesions and fulminant
presentation. However, LP showed no organisms and only eight
WBCs. Similarly, his blood cultures were negative.  He received
one dose of Ceftriaxone at the outside hospital.  He was noted to
have new maculopapular rash over his upper extremities and torso.
Ceftriaxone was discontinued on admission to [**Hospital1 346**] secondary to possible allergy.
However, this was restarted one day later per Infectious
Disease recommendation and continued for two days.
