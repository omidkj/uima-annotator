HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Dr. [**Known lastname 38485**] is an 88 year-old
retired physician with [**Name Initial (PRE) **] history of metastatic colon cancer
and two bouts of colon cancer who presented to [**Hospital1 346**] Emergency Department on [**11-12**]
with fecal impaction.  At that time he was found to have
another mass in his descending colon.  He was also found to
have a 10 cm stool ball in his rectum.  The patient was
attempted to be disimpacted multiple times in the Emergency
Room and another time on the floor without success.  He was
then seen by the GI Service who recommended aggressive
regimen of Golytely and enemas from below.  This allowed the
patient to have several bowel movements, but then remained
constipated following those few initial bowel movements.  He
subsequently refused to have any other further interventions
including manual disimpactions.  He suffered a V fibrillation
arrest with successful fibrillation on the floor.  He was
transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for one day
where he was intubated and extubated and sent back to the
floor.

He subsequently continued to refuse any medical interventions
and then experienced a perforation of his colon with a large
amount of free air in his abdomen.  Discussions extensively
were held with the family regarding the patient's prognosis
and status and the decision was made to make the patient
essentially CMO.  Five days later the patient expired.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  The patient's past medical history
include nonsmall cell lung cancer with spinal metastasis
status post radiation treatment, coronary artery disease,
atrial fibrillation, hypertension, colon cancer status post
resection, benign prostatic hypertrophy, congestive heart
failure, iron deficiency anemia and status post placement of
a pacer for tachybrady syndrome in [**2132**], status post
cerebrovascular accident with residual left arm weakness.

The patient's family refused a postmortem examination.

CAUSE OF DEATH:  Hypotension likely from sepsis from the
perforation of his colon.
