Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3326**]
Chief Complaint:
Neck mass

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none


History of Present Illness:
81 y.o. woman with recent neck trauma, now on ventilator,
presents with right neck mass noted at [**Hospital3 **].  The
mass was noted yesterday and noted to bulge out during cough or
Valsalva.  There was concern for a tracheo-subcutaneous fistula
so she was sent to ED for evaluation.  A neck CT did not show
evidence of subc air.  It was concerning for either jugular vein
dilatation or a mass in the supraclavicular fossa.  However,
further characterization could not be made based on a
non-contrast CT so further imaging would be required.  Pt is
otherwise at her baseline.  There are no acute resp issues and
she is hemodynamically stable.  She denies pain or dyspnea.

Past Medical History:
1) s/p fall with neck trauma
2) central cord syndrome
3) Respiratory failure secondary to cord involvement with
psuedomonas, serratia and MRSA VAP.

Neck CT:
1. There is no air within the subcutaneous tissues of the right
supraclavicular fossa to suggest a tracheal subcutaneous
fistula. There is likely an enlarged right internal jugular vein
v. a mass in the supraclavicular fossa on the right, though IV
contrast could not be administered for confirmation. This
finding could be confirmed with ultrasound.
2. Small lymph nodes within the neck and superior mediastinum.
3. Heavily calcified aorta.
4. Intralobular septal thickening and possible scarring at the
lung apices.
5. Status post anterior fixation of the cervical spine.
.
Ultrasound:  Right supraclavicular lesion represents the bulb of
the right internal jugular vein.


Brief Hospital Course:
81 y.o. woman with recent neck trauma, now on ventilator without
failure to wean, presenting with new neck deformity.  Pt is
asymptomatic, and there does not appear to be any compromise of
airway or circulation.
..
1) Neck Mass:  Imaging findings were consistent with a
dilatation/aneurysm of the R internal jugular vein.  Vascular
surgery evaluated the patient and determined no need for
intervention at this time.  They recommended a repeat ultrasound
to evaluate the mass in 1 week.  They also suggested a CT with
venous phase contrast in 1 week to evaluate for any progression
of the aneurysm.
..
2) Respiratory Failure:  Pt has reportedly not been able to be
weaned at [**Hospital1 **].  We continued her on current vent settings
and did not attempt further weaning.  She was stable on her
current vent settings.
..
3) Ventilator associated pneumonia:  She is on meropenem,
colistin, and linezolid, which we contined as at rehab.  She had
a low-grade fever on arrival here, but otherwise showed no
evidence of active infection and was afebrile thereafter.
Antibiotics should be continued for the planned course
(linezolid to be continued until [**2-9**], meropenem until [**2-10**],
and colistin until [**2-7**], per the medication list from [**Hospital1 **]).
..
4) CAD:  We continued lopressor at her usual dose.  It is not
clear why she is not on ASA.
..
5) Asthma:  Continue spiriva, salmeterol, albuterol, and
flovent.  We held her mucomyst.
.
6) F/E/N:  Tube feeds were continued.  Electrolytes were
repleted as needed.
..
7) PPx:  SC heparin for DVT ppx and PPI.
