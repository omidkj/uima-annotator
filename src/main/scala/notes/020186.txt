Chief Complaint:
Syncope

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Endoscopy with re-banding


History of Present Illness:
35 y/o man with PSC c/b recurrent cholangitis ([**8-/2155**], [**10/2155**])
s/p CBD stenting and cholecystectomy ([**2155-10-29**]) as well as
cirrhosis (MELD 7) c/b grade II/III esophageal varicies
presenting to the ED with syncope. Pt states he noted
lightheadedness and palpitations the morning of admission while
lying in bed. He stood up to go to the bathroom and awoke on the
floor some time later, does not know how long he was unconscious
for. He also reports 3 days of fatigue and dark stools, but
denies BRBPR or hematemesis. Of note, he underwent EGD ([**2156-3-2**])
that showed grade II/III esophageal varicies and portal
gastropathy; 3 bands were placed without complication. He has
had multiple admissions for chonangitis, but no admissions to
[**Hospital1 18**] for GI bleeding and has never had hematemesis in the past.

.
In the ED, initial VS were:
T 98 HR 75 BP 93/51 RR 16 O2 Sat 98% RA
He received 2L NS with improvement in his BP to the 110s. He
subsequently became hypotensive again to the 80s. NG lavage was
performed and returned BRB that did not clear. 16G and 18G PIVs
were placed. Labs were notable for HCT 20 (baseline 30-35), INR
1.1, platelets 351. He was transfused 2 units pRBCs. Liver was
called and recommended Octreotide/Pantoprazole gtt and
Ceftraixone 1g.
.
On arrival to the MICU, initial VS were:
T 98 HR 83 BP 93/53 RR 14 O2 Sat 100% RA
He denied CP/SOB, lightheadedness, palpitations. Stated he felt
tired but otherwise had no complaints.

Imaging:

CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2156-3-29**] 3:35 AM
FINDINGS: There are increased pulmonary vascular markings and
redistribution. Prominent azygos vein is also noted. There is
mild cardiomegaly, unchanged.  No focal consolidation, pleural
effusion, or pneumothorax is seen. The NG tube courses through
the esophagus and terminates outside the field of view.

IMPRESSION: Mild volume overload.

US ABD LIMIT, SINGLE ORGAN Study Date of [**2156-3-29**] 3:16 PM
IMPRESSION:

1. Small volume ascites.
2. Heterogeneous, coarsened liver, consistent with known primary
sclerosing cholangitis and cirrhosis.

[**2156-3-29**] EGD
A large clot was found in the body and stomach. Due to it size,
it could not be suctioned out. The remainder of the stomach
appeared normal.
Varices at the upper and middle third of the esophagus
Varices at the lower third of the esophagus (ligation)
Normal EGD to third part of the duodenum

CXR [**3-31**]: As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no
relevant
change. No evidence of focal parenchymal opacities indicative of
pneumonia. The orogastric tube has been removed. Unchanged
borderline size of the cardiac silhouette without pulmonary
edema. The lateral radiograph reveals a minimal pleural effusion
bilaterally, restricted to the dorsal parts of the costophrenic
sinus.


Brief Hospital Course:
35 y/o man with PSC c/b cirrhosis and grade II/III esophageal
varicies presenting with syncope in the setting of HCT 20 and
recent melena and fatigue, found to have sclerosis near prior
banding site, likely source of GIB, s/p re-banding.
.
# Syncope: Likely related to orthostasis [**2-5**] GIB given HCT drop
and known portal gastropathy, which is the most likely source of
his bleeding.  Also consider gastric ulcer given epigastric pain
the morning or admission. Given BRB did not clear with NG
lavage, concern for ongoing bleeding. Given his age, cardiogenic
syncope is unlikely. EKG without block or abnormal inter
