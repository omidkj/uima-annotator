Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1234**]
Chief Complaint:
Cold left foot

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2114-6-1**] Left groin exploration


History of Present Illness:
HPI: 69F with a longstanding history of PVD who in [**2103**]
underwent
left fem to above knee popliteal bypass and has subsequently had
multiple vascular interventions. She was recently diagnosed with
stenosis of the left CFA with blunted graft velocities.
Endarterectomy with graft revision with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was planned
after resolution of her groin infections.

She returns today with approximately ten days of worsening LLE
pain. She states that she still has motor function but does not
have sensation in the foot. She denies fevers or chills at this
time.

Pertinent Results:
[**2114-6-1**] CTA ABD:CT OF THE PELVIS AND EXTREMITIES WITH IV
CONTRAST:
The bladder is mildly distended.  The uterus is normal.  No
adnexal masses are detected.  There is no intrapelvic free fluid
or lymphadenopathy.  Included views of the intrapelvic small and
large bowel are normal.

There are no bony lesions concerning for malignancy or
infection.  No acute fracture is detected.  The patient is post
bilateral total knee
arthroplasties, with no evidence of hardware loosening or
failure.

Moderate soft tissue edema extends throughout the subcutaneous
tissues of both lower extremities.  No focal fluid collections
are identified.

CT ANGIOGRAM:
Severe atherosclerotic calcifications are again seen throughout
the abdominal aorta and iliac branches.

LEFT VESSELS:
Compared to the [**2114-2-18**] examination, there is now new
occlusion of the left common iliac artery (3A:30) and left
external iliac artery. Severe
atherosclerotic calcifications of the left CFA limits evaluation
for patency, but no internal flow is seen.

A femoropopliteal (above-knee) bypass is again seen, with
unchanged moderate narrowing at the common femoral takeoff
(3A:91), but demonstrating wide patency otherwise.  Branches of
the femoral profunda are patent. The native superficial femoral
artery is heavily calcified and no internal flow is detected.
Extensive calcifications are seen throughout the popliteal
artery, with the lower segment not visualized due to extensive
streak artifacts from the left knee prosthesis.  Three-vessel
runoff is demonstrated (3A:293), however, there is marked
attenuation of the left anterior tibial artery in comparison to
the prior CT examination (3A:345), and diminutive flow is seen
at the dorsalis pedis.  In comparison to the [**2-23**]
examination, there appears to be overall diminished flow of the
peroneal and posterior tibial arteries, however, patency remains
preserved.

RIGHT VESSELS:
Severe atherosclerotic calcifications and stenosis of the right
iliac artery, particularly at the distal portion and external
segment, appears minimally changed since [**2114-2-18**].  Patency of
the right profundus femoral is demonstrated.  However, there is
again complete occlusion of the right superficial femoral
artery.  Evaluation for the right popliteal artery is impossible
due to the degree of extensive calcifications and streak
artifacts from the right knee prosthesis.

A three-vessel runoff is demonstrated at the right calf, with
irregular
attenuation throughout the right posterior tibial artery, all
unchanged since [**2114-2-23**].

IMPRESSION:
1.  Occlusion of the left common iliac, external iliac, and
common femoral
artery is new since [**2114-2-23**].
2.  Unchanged moderate stenosis at the takeoff of the left
femoropopliteal
bypass (above-knee).  Patent flow and caliber is demonstrated
through the
remainder of the course of the graft.
3.  Three-vessel runoff demonstrated at the left calf, however,
there is
overall decreased vascular flow, in particular the left anterior
tibial
artery, in comparison to the [**2114-2-23**] examination, likely
from poor iliac and femoral inflow.
4.  Unchanged occlusion of the right superficial femoral artery.
 Right
three-vessel runoff is again seen, with mild irregular
attenuation of the
posterior tibial artery.
