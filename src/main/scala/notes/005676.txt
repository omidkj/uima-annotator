Abdominal Pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:

History of Present Illness:
76 yo s/p recent OM1, RCA stent [**2171-3-28**], d/c'd from [**Hospital1 18**] 1 day
ago, p/w epigastric pain to [**Hospital3 **]. Concern for instent
stenosis but quality of abd pain changes (diffuse then localized
to RLQ) D/C hep gave morphine and transfered to [**Hospital1 18**]. On
admission, afebrile,WBC 26, diffuse abd tenderness. Normal
non-contrast CT abd: no free air or RP bleed. In the ED, c/o
epigastic abd pain increased with decline in her SBP and
elevated HR.  Intubated electively for MRA.  Became hypotensive
and went into AF/RVR following intubation and was cardioverted
with 200 joules. NSR was established and aggressive IVF was
initiated. To avoid contrast nephropathy (had gotten 2 dye load
already) underwent MRA to evaluate for mesenteric ischemia -->
patent vessels; FOS. In addition, patient presents with
leukocytosis (26) that rose to 42 with left shift. Surgery
evaluated pt and asked for contrast CT.
During prior admission, patient undewent 2nd angio for ? of R
atrial mass to r/o perforation. This was negative. During that
admission she was d/c'd on a steroid taper for presumed COPD.

[**2171-4-1**]: FEMORAL VASCULAR ULTRASOUND: Grayscale, color, and
Doppler son[**Name (NI) 1417**] of the left groin were performed. The left
common femoral artery and left common femoral vein appeared
normal without evidence of pseudoaneurysm or fistulous
connection. Normal arterial and venous waveforms are
demonstrated along with normal color flow within both of these
vessels.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of AV fistula, pseudoaneurysm, or
hematoma within the left groin.

[**2171-4-1**]: RIGHT UPPER QUADRANT ULTRASOUND: Within the gallbladder
are two shadowing gallstones, the larger of which measures 1 cm
in diameter. The gallbladder is otherwise unremarkable without
evidence of significant distention, gallbladder wall edema, or
pericholecystic fluid. There is no intra- or extra-hepatic
biliary ductal dilatation, and the common bile duct measures 5
mm. A son[**Name (NI) 493**] [**Name (NI) **] sign was not elicited.
IMPRESSION: Cholelithiasis without evidence of cholecystitis.

[**2171-4-1**]: MRA of abdomen to rule out mesenteric ischemia:
FINDINGS: Celiac artery and superior mesenteric artery are
widely patent at their origins and throughout their courses. The
most proximal first few cm of the [**Female First Name (un) 899**] are patent; however, more
distally, the [**Female First Name (un) 899**] is not well visualized.
No bowel wall thickening. There is a large amount of stool
within the colon; however, there is no evidence of obstruction.
The liver, adrenals, spleen, and pancreas are unremarkable. A
few subcentimeter gallstones are noted. Renal cysts are
identified. Kidneys are otherwise unremarkable. Right renal
artery is widely patent; however, there is focal high-grade
stenosis of the origin of the left renal artery.
There is trace ascites.
Atelectasis is noted at the right lung base.
Note is made of multilevel compression fractures within the
lower thoracic spine, probably chronic.
IMPRESSION:
1) Widely patent superior mesenteric and celiac arteries.
Proximal [**Female First Name (un) 899**] is patent, however, is not well visualized more
distally.
2) No bowel wall thickening or edema to suggest ischemia.
