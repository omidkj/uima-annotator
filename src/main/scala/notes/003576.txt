IMAGING:
EKG:[**2183-6-19**]: NSR at around 60, nl axis, nl intervals, no ST-T
changes. No previous for comparision
.
Radiologic: Head CT [**6-18**]: Bilateral hemorrhagic contusions and
subarachnoid blood, most significant along the left frontal and
left temporal areas. Fractures of the left maxillary sinus are
identified, but would be better assessed by dedicated
sinus CT. Opacified right mastoid air cells may also belie
subtle base of skull fractures in the trauma setting despite the
lack of an identifiable fracture lines, and clinical correlation
is recommended.
.
Repeat Head CT [**6-18**]: 1. Bilateral subarachnoid hemorrhage,
slightly increased, and left temporal and frontal contusions,
not significantly changed, compared to the recent study.
2. Disproportionate prominence of the lateral and third
ventricles c/w cortical sulci, raising possibility of underlying
communicating hydrocephalus (doubt obstructive, as no
intraventricular hemorrhage).
2. Fracture of the left maxillary sinus lateral wall, with blood
in that sinus, as well as the left zygomatic arch.
3. Probable acute-on-longstanding inflammatory disease in the
right mastoid process and middle ear; review of bone algorithm
images from previous head/maxillofacial/cervical CT studies
demonstrates no definite temporal bone or other skull base
fracture.
.
MRI head [**6-20**]: No evidence of diffuse axonal injury. Left
frontal and temporal and small right frontal subarachnoid
hemorrhages, corresponding with prior CT.
.
EEG [**2183-6-26**]: IMPRESSION: Abnormal portable EEG due to the slow
and disorganized background and bursts of generalized slowing.
These findings indicate a widespread encephalopathic condition
affecting both cortical and subcortical structures. Medications,
metabolic disturbances, and infection are among the most common
causes. Trauma and raised pressure are also possible causes. No
prominent lateralized findings were evident to correlate with
the history of subdural hematoma. There were no epileptiform
features.
.
CT sinus [**6-18**]: Air-fluid level with hemorrhage in the left
maxillary sinus, with minimally displaced fracture of the
posterior wall of the left maxillary sinus. No displacement of
intra-orbital content.
.
Portable Chest [**6-25**]: Tracheostomy and percutaneous gastrostomy
in standard positions. Slightly worsened left basilar
atelectasis, aspiration, or pneumonia. Probable small bilateral
layering pleural effusions.
.
[**7-4**] CXR: Patient is status post tracheostomy.  The
cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.  There is a
persistent left lower lobe consolidation.  This is unchanged
appearance compared to the prior
examination.  There is a small left pleural effusion.  The right
lung is clear.
.
[**7-3**]: No DVT on bilat LENI's.
.
[**7-3**]: Abd US: This exam is limited secondary to patient
unresponsiveness.  The visualized liver demonstrates normal
echogenicity with no focal lesions identified.  The gallbladder
is unremarkable.  The common duct is not dilated.  There is
appropriate forward portal venous flow.  The right kidney
measures 9.5 cm. The left kidney measures 8.9 cm.  There is no
evidence of hydronephrosis, masses, or stones.  The pancreas and
aorta are not well visualized.


Brief Hospital Course:
Pt. was transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED after evaluation in an OSH.
At the OSH the pt. was found to have SAH s/p a fall from
standing and down about 4 stairs.  The pt. was brought by
[**Location (un) **] to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED where he was immediately transferred
to the trauma bay.  There he reportedly had a GCS of 15 before
acutely decompensating to a GCS of 10 for which he was
electively intubated.  The pt. underwent CT scan on admission
that confirmed the presence of SAH.  The pt. was then admitted
to the trauma ICU for care.

Neuro:  The pt. underwent serial head CT scans over the first 24
hours of his hospitalization.  They were stable, showing only
slight increase in the amount of bleed the pt. had suffered.  On
HD 3 the pt. underwent an MRI that was negative for diffuse
axonal injury.  The pt.'s exam remained relatively unchanged
from the day of admit during which his pupils were equal and
reactive, he localizes with his left upper extremity and will
withdraw bilateral lower extremities. He is intermittently awake
and will open his eyes intermittently spontaneously.  No verbal
response.  He was put on phenytoin for seizure prophylaxis but
developed a transaminitis.  Dilantin was changed to Keppra and
the transaminitis resolved over a matter of days. He has had no
seizure activity.

Resp: Pt. was intubated electively in the ED because of acute
decompensation.  He remained on the ventilator until HD8 - at
which time he underwent a trach.  Moreover, he began spiking
fevers on HD 4 and at that time CXR showed slight patchy
infiltrates.  By HD 7 the pt continued spiking fevers
occasionally and the patchy infiltrates had organized in the LLL
suggesting a pneumonia. He received a one week course of
antibiotics and was able to wean down to a trach mask at the
time of discharge.  He then developed a second fever and grew
stenotrophomonas on sputum.  ID was consulted and suggested a 14
day course of bactrim and levoquin, which he is currently on at
the time of discharge.  He is sat
