Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 618**]
Chief Complaint:
Disorientation with Right temporal lobe hemorrhage

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is an 83 yo LH F with h/o HTN, HLD, dCHF, mild
dementia and AFib (on Coumadin with Lovenox bridge) who presents
to [**Hospital1 18**] ED with disorientation and HTN to 190. Neuro is
consulted for intraparenchymal hemorrhage on head CT. Her
history was obtained from her son and granddaughter, as patient
is confused and unable to give a coherent history.

Of note, patient was recently admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] from [**Date range (1) 59633**]
for dyspnea and was found to have new-onset AFib. She was on a
heparin gtt while in the hospital, and discharged on Coumadin
5mg daily with Lovenox bridge.

Following hospitalization, patient was in her usual state of
health when her son last spoke with her 4 days ago. She has had
no recent falls. Today at 3pm, the nursing staff [**Street Address(1) 19140**] where she lives noted that she was newly disoriented and
did not know where she was (normally AAOx3 and lucid, per son,
although she does have mild dementia). They checked her
temperature which
was 100.3. They called EMS out of concern for altered mental
status.

On arrival to the ED, vitals were BP 192/74, P 53, RR 16, SaO2
95% RA, T 98.7. ED staff noted irregular respirations and were
concerned for [**Location (un) **] response. Labs notable for INR 2.0.
Noncontrast head CT showed 4.0x2.3 right temporal lobe IPH with
small intraventricular extension, with mild surrounding edema
but
no midline shift. Patient was given 2 units FFP and 10 units
vitamin K.

On exam currently, patient has no complaints and does not know
why she is in the hospital. She is alert to person only. She is
intermittently somnolent but awakens quickly to voice. She
becomes agitated with questioning, asking examiner "what do you
want?" repeatedly.

Neuro and general ROS were unable to be obtained from patient
given patient's poor cooperation. Per her family, ROS is
negative except for anorexia and significant (30 lb) weight loss
over the past year after a prolonged rehab stay for a fall last
year.

Pulmonary: CTABL
Cardiac: RRR, no murmurs
Abdomen: soft, nontender, nondistended
Extremities: no edema, pulses palpated
Skin: no rashes or lesions noted.

Neurologic:
-Mental Status: Alert, oriented x 1.5 (person, year [**2172**], does
not know she is in hospital even when given choices). Unable to
relate coherent history, repeatedly asks "why am I here?" and
"what do you want?". Inattentive, unable to name [**Doctor Last Name 1841**] backward.
Language: intact repetition, but poor comprehension (unable to
follow commands without visual prompting). Many paraphasic
errors with [**Location (un) 1131**]. Poor naming: unable to identify high or low
frequency objects. Able to read without difficulty. Able to
register 3 objects but recalled 0/5 at 5 minutes. Seemed to be
neglecting the left at times.
-Cranial Nerves:
I: Olfaction not tested.
II: PERRL 3 to 2mm and brisk (right pupil surgical). Visual
fields grossly full to confrontation. Funduscopic exam revealed
no papilledema, exudates, or hemorrhages.
III, IV, VI: EOMI without nystagmus.  Normal saccades.
V: Facial sensation intact to light touch.
VII: No facial droop, facial musculature symmetric.
VIII: Hearing intact to finger-rub bilaterally.
IX, X: Palate elevates symmetrically.
[**Doctor First Name 81**]: does not cooperate.

bilaterally. No adventitious movements, such as tremor, noted.
No asterixis noted.
