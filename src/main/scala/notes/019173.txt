Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 330**]
Chief Complaint:
readmit for mental status changes

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None.


History of Present Illness:
77 year-old M with chronic liver disease, pulmonary fibrosis,
and CHF who presented with altered mental status. He was
recently discharged (hospitalized from [**Date range (1) 3270**]) from the
[**Doctor Last Name 3271**]-[**Doctor Last Name 679**] service for altered mental status, increased
lethargy and confusion which was attributed to hepatic
encephalopathy and UTI. Prior to his admission on [**2181-5-6**], the
patient was taking Spironolactone, 50 mg daily and Atenolol, 50
mg daily. Ammonia level on prior admission was 114 and total
bilirubin 4.0. RUQ U/S revealed changes c/w chronic liver
disease, patent portal vein and cholelithiasis. EGD revealed e/o
portal gastropathy, varices in the lower and middle thirds of
the esophagus and esophagitis. Also of note, he was
thrombocytopenic which was attributed to chronic liver disease.
Lipid panel revealed high LDL. He also had Guaiac positive
stools. Mental status improved with lactulose. He was started on
nadalol and a PPI. Hepatitis A & B serologies were sent and
unremarkable. A1AT was 72 (83-199), [**Doctor First Name **] titer was 1:40.
Hereditary hemochromatosis mutational analysis was sent.
.
The patient was discharged to rehab on [**2181-5-11**]. On the day of
current admission ([**2181-5-13**]), the NH reports that the patient had
increased lethargy and poor appetite. He was found to be 95% on
2L NC. He complained of indigestion to the staff. Per his
family, he also had chest pain the day PTA. Labs demonstrated a
leukocytosis and worsening LFTs. He received Vancomycin 1 g,
levofloxacin 750 mg, and Flagyl 500 mg in the ED. He was
transferred to the MICU for further management. Cardiology was
consulted for possible STEMI, but did not recommend
catheterization for what is felt to be a recent posterolateral
MI. RUQ U/S was limited by gaseous abdominal distension, but
revealed normal CBD (5mm) and two hypoechoic nodules within the
right liver lobe. Pt denies N/V/orthopnea/platypnea.

IMAGING/STUDIES:
[**2181-5-13**] CXR: A single portable radiograph of the chest
demonstrates no change in the cardiomediastinal contour when
compared with [**2181-5-6**]. There is no change in the appearance of
the lungs. No effusion. Trachea is midline. The aorta is
calcified and tortuous. Calcified gallstones are again noted.
There is retained oral contrast projecting over the left upper
quadrant.
.
[**2181-5-13**] LIVER/GB U/S: 1. Extremely limited study due to gaseous
distention. The gallbladder itself is not visualized. The common
bile duct is not dilated measuring 5 mm. 2. Two hypoechoic
nodules within the right liver lobe require further evaluation
with MRI or multiphasic CT, particularly in the setting of
background liver disease.
.
[**2181-5-13**] CT HEAD: No intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect. No
significant change from [**2181-5-6**].


Brief Hospital Course:
77 year-old M with cirrhosis, pulmonary fibrosis, diastolic
dysfunction and moderate to severe AS presented with delirium,
worsening LFTs, leukocytosis. He ultimated died of cardiac
arrest. His active hospital issues included:

# Encephalopathy: This was felt to be related to liver
dysfunction and possibly an infectious etiology given
leukocytosis on admission. No infectious source found, but pt
responded clinically and with decrease in WBC count on
vancomycin and pip-tazo. Vanc was subsequently d/c'd. His
lactulose was titrated to [**3-4**] BMs per day

# Cirrhosis: Etiology remained unclear. It was felt unlikely to
be related to hereditary hemochromatosis or alpha-1-antitrypsin
deficiency (in the setting of cirrhosis, this level can be low).
Although he did not have a very strong history of alcohol use,
ultimately, it was felt to be more likely is EtOH-induced +/-
NAFLD. Has liver nodules on most recent imaging studies
concerning for HCC, had low AFP on last admission, although
relatively insensitive for HCC. Also could be regenerative
nodules. Albumin 2.6, INR 1.9.  He continued nadolol for
variceal prophylaxis.  He was initially on spironolactone and
furosemide, but then  d/c'ed on admission [**2-2**] ARF.

# ARF: Baseline Cr 1.0-1.2, which likely represents significant
CKD given his cirrhosis and low muscle mass. Cr was 1.3 on
admission, increased to 2.0 this morning. Possible etiologies
include pre-renal vs hepatorenal syndrome vs ATN. In unit,
started on midodrine and octreotide and albumin for possible
HRS. Not responding. Remains non-oliguric. Urine lytes c/w
either prerenal state or HRS. FENA <1%, Na<10. He continued
albumin, midodrine and octreotide, but creatinine continued to
rise. He also developed hyperkalemia with EKG changes requiring
kayexalate.

# Guaiac positive stools: Possible that this is related to
portal gastropathy vs esophagitis vs variceal leak. Hct trending
down still.

# ? STEMI/CAD/CHF: Echo on this admission revealed diastolic
dysfunction, normal systolic function and moderate to severe AS.
No laboratory or clinical evidence of ACS given troponin flat.
Aspirin was stopped given falling Hct and known portal
gastropathy and varices

# ILD: severe and end-stage per recent chest CT. He continued
prednisone 10 daily.

# FEN: low sodium pureed diet, nutrition consult, replete lytes
prn

# PPX: no heparin given thrombocytopenia and ? GI bleed

# Code status: Patient was intially FULL CODE, but after frank
discussion with family about prognosis, he was changed to
DNR/DNI. Family and patient participated in the discussion.
Palliative care and social work were also involved.

Then, on the day of death, his renal function continued to
decline, he became oliguric, increased midodrine to 10 mg tid
for presumed HRS. Checked vanco level which was 41 so vanco
held. Con
