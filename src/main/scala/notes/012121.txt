P-MIBI [**2166-5-2**]
No anginal symptoms and no additional ECG changes from
baseline with IV dipyridamole infusion.
1) Mild reversible inferolateral defect (circumflex
distribution).
2) Severe defect at base of inferior wall is likely related to
diaphragmatic attenuation. 3) EF 60%
.
CXR [**2166-5-1**]
Interval removal of the ET tube and the NG tube. No evidence of
pneumothorax. Interval clearing of congestive heart failure.
.
ECG Study Date of [**2166-4-30**]  7:43:06 AM
Sinus rhythm. Probable left ventricular hypertrophy with ST-T
wave abnormalities. Poor R wave progression - could be due in
part to left ventricular hypertrophy and/or lead placement but
consider also anteroseptal myocardial infarct, age indeterminate
Cannot exclude in part ischemia - clinical correlation is
suggested Since previous tracing of [**2166-4-29**], further ST-T wave
changes present

ECHO Study Date of [**2166-4-30**]
The left atrium is normal in size. There is moderate symmetric
left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. There is  mild regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction with focal basal inferior  hypokinesis. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed.  Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic  valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good
leaflet excursion.  There is no aortic valve stenosis. Mild (1+)
aortic regurgitation is seen. The  mitral valve leaflets are
structurally normal. Physiologic mitral  regurgitation is seen
(within normal limits). The estimated pulmonary artery  systolic
pressure is normal. There is no pericardial effusion. There is a
slight left to right shunt across the interatrial septum
consistent  with a small atrial septal defect or stretched
patent foramen ovale.
.
TUNNELED W/O PORT  [**2166-4-30**] 12
Successful exchange of a temporary right IJ dialysis line to a
23 cm tunneled dialysis catheter via the right internal jugular
vein. The catheter tip to cuff length measures 23 cm. The tip of
the catheter is present in the high right atrium. The catheter
is ready for immediate use.


Brief Hospital Course:
64 year old female, history of PVD, ESRD, DM, BKA, CAD status
post recent cath w/PTCA for recurrent chest pain presented after
episode repiratory distress 2:30 am on day of admission and
question of bradycardia/presyncope on transit to hospital.
Patient was intubated in the field, transferred here from [**Hospital1 3325**]. On transfer, patient was hemodynamically stable,
intubated, and given heparin intravenously.  Patient presented
with CHF exacerbation requiring intubation and emergent
dialysis.  During the hospital course, she had sparse
coffee-ground emesis via NGT.

.
1. Coronary artery disease:  Risk  factors include DM, lipids,
HTN, age. Patient was status post cardiac cath with PTCA of OM1
for 2VD (LM 40%, OM ostial 80%, mid 90% ballooned w/20%
residual, +collaterals) and presented with CHF exacerbation that
resolved with daily hemodialysis. TnT was elevated at baseline
due to ESRD. She was continued on BB, ASA, plavix, nitrate, and
ACEI. A CCB and statin were added. Also, her BB and ACEI were
titrated up for improved BP control. Consider adding verapamil
if needed.  Persantine MIBI revealed 1) Mild reversible
inferolateral defect (circumflex distribution).
2) Severe defect at base of inferior wall is likely related to
diaphragmatic
attenuation. 3) EF 60%. Patient preferred medical management and
was discharged in stable condition with plans for close follow
up.
.
2. Diastolic CHF: Echocardiogram [**2166-4-30**] showed EF 45% with focal
basal HK, 1+ MR/AR, sm ASD.  CXR [**2166-4-29**] was indicative of CHF
that cleared on repeat CXR [**2166-5-1**] due to daily hemodialysis x3
and lasix 80mg IV x1. Faint bibasilar crackles were noted on
exam.
.
3. Rhythm: NSR was maintained.
.
4. ESRD: The renal service was consulted for daily hemodialysis.
Sevalemer was continued. IR placed a tunneled SVC line for
permanent HD access. Volume loss with HD was documented as the
following: [**2166-4-30**] -3L; [**2166-5-1**] -2L, [**2166-5-2**] -3L. Patient was to
resume TTHSa schedule for outpatient HD.
.
5. Respiratory: Patient arrived intubated for respiratory
distress with possible aspiration event; she was successfully
extubated [**5-2**]. Antibiotics that had been started for suspected
pneumonia were discontinued after the sputum culture was
negative for growth.
.
6. h/o Leukocytosis, Low Grade Temp: Sputum culture initially
grew gram pos cocci in clusters/pairs. Then the patient was
started on renally dosed vancomycin and levoquin IV on [**4-30**] for
presumed ventilator-associated pneumonia. Vancomycin was
discontinued after final sputum culture results revealed growth
of sparse normal flora. Levoquin was continued for urinary tract
infection with UA +mod bact, >50 WBC, and LE. Blood and urine
cultures were negative for growth.
.
7. UGIB (coffee ground emesis) was noted to be produced via NG
tube and was thought likely related to patient's history of
peptuc ulcer disease. She received proton pump inhibitor twice
daily and the heparin drip had been discontinued. Close
monitoring of hematocrit showed a drop for which the patient was
given 2u PRBCs; however, the hematocrit change was suspected due
to volume shifts with daily dialysis. GI service was consulted
and EGD was deferred per patient preference as outpatient
followup.
.
8. Heme: Patient known to have ESRD on HD. She received 2u PRBCs
[**4-30**] for decreased HCT with good response. Stools were guaiac
negative.
