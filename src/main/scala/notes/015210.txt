Findings
LEFT ATRIUM: Moderate LA enlargement. Good (>20 cm/s) LAA
ejection velocity.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: A catheter or pacing wire is
seen in the RA and extending into the RV. No ASD by 2D or color
Doppler.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Wall thickness and cavity dimensions were
obtained from 2D images. Normal LV wall thickness, cavity size
and regional/global systolic function (LVEF >55%).

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTA: Normal ascending aorta diameter. No atheroma in ascending
aorta. Normal descending aorta diameter.

AORTIC VALVE: Three aortic valve leaflets. Mildly thickened
aortic valve leaflets. Mild AS (AoVA 1.2-1.9cm2). Trace AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Moderately thickened mitral valve leaflets. Mild
mitral annular calcification. Mild valvular MS (MVA 1.5-2.0cm2).
Moderate (2+) MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets with trivial
TR.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Physiologic (normal) PR.

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify I was present in compliance with HCFA
regulations. The patient was under general anesthesia throughout
the procedure. No TEE related complications. The patient appears
to be in sinus rhythm. Results were personally reviewed with the
MD caring for the patient.
Conclusions
PRE-BYPASS: The left atrium is moderately dilated. No atrial
septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular
wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic
function are normal (LVEF >55%). Right ventricular chamber size
and free wall motion are normal. There are three aortic valve
leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There
is mild aortic valve stenosis (area 1.2-1.9cm2). Trace aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are moderately
thickened. There is mild valvular mitral stenosis (area
1.5-2.0cm2). Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There
is no pericardial effusion.

Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in person of the results in the
operating room.

POST-CPB: On infusions of epi, neo. AV pacing. Well-seated
bioprosthetic valve in the mitral position. Trace MR, no
paravalvular leak. Preserved biventricular systolic function on
inotropic support. AI is mild. Peak gradient of 20 mmHG through
the aortic valve with [**Location (un) 109**] now 1.3 probably reflects higher
cardiac output on inotropes. Aortic contour is normal post
decannulation.
  I certify that I was present for this procedure in compliance
with HCFA regulations.

Brief Hospital Course:
She was admitted to the hospital preoperatively for intravenous
diuresis.  She was brought to the operating room and underwent
mitral valve replacement.  See operative note for further
details.  She received cefazolin for perioperative antibiotics.
She was transferred to the intensive care unit for hemodynamic
monitoring.  In the first twenty four hours she was weaned from
sedation, awoke neurologically intact, and was extubated without
complications. She was started on beta blockers and gentle
diuresis.  She was transferred to the floor and had episode of
atrial fibrillation post operative day 1 treated with beta
blockers, and then started on amiodarone for reoccurrences of
atrial fibrillation.  She continued to go in and out of atrial
fibrillation and was started on coumadin for anticoagulation.
Last episode of atrial fibrillation [**2-26**] in the am. Her INR
became elevated, coumadin held, and monitored level closely.
Physical therapy worked with her on strength and mobility.  By
post-operative day nine she was ready for discharge to home with
services.  Her INR on the day of discharge was 3.2 so coumadin
was again held.  Her discharge paperwork advised the dose to
continue to be held until her INR fell below 2.  The next INR
draw is scheduled for [**2136-3-2**] and Dr.[**Name (NI) 19892**] office was
faxed recent coumadin doses and corresponding INRs.
