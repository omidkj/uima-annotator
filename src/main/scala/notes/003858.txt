.
74 yo female with severe end-stage COPD on home oxygen, dCHF, on
treatment for MAC with recent admission for COPD exacerbation
presents to the ED with abdominal pain and constipation.
.
Patient reports [**10-3**] lower quadrant abdominal pain x 1 day.
Also with severe nausea and one episode of vomiting
(non-bloody).  Last BM was [**2116-11-16**]. Patient has been taking
miralax, senna and colace daily.  Started lactulose yesterday
and glycerin suppository without any effect.  Poor po intake
with increasing fatigue.  Daughter called patient's palliative
care doctor (for end-stage COPD) who recommended coming to the
ED for further evaluation.
.
Patient was recently hospitalized [**2116-11-17**] - [**2116-11-20**] with
dyspnea from end-stage COPD.  Palliative care involved, per note
patient realized she is end-stage however does not wish to be
dnr/dni at this time.  Although daughter elaborates that patient
would not want aggressive measures however feels that if she is
dnr/dni she doesn't receive adequate medical treatment in the
hospital.
.
Upon arrival on the floor patient reports she feels slight
better but continues to have significant abdominal pain.  NGT is
on intermittent wall suction and is preventing episodes of
vomiting.  Denies any cp, lightheadedness or dizziness.  SOB

.
[**2116-11-30**] CT a/p without contrast:
Extensive fecal loading without evidence of obstruction. Small
quantity of
free fluid in the left paracolic gutter is a non-specific
finding. Small 7-mm left renal hyperdensity should be further
characterized with repeat renal ultrasound or MR on a
non-emergent basis.
.
[**2116-11-30**] CXR:
No significant interval change. Stable bibasilar opacities most
likely relate to atelectasis. Pulmonary emphysema.
.
[**2116-11-30**] Humerus xray:
No evidence of acute fracture.
.
[**2116-11-30**] L. ankle xray:
Soft tissue swelling about the lateral malleolus without acute
fracture seen. No dislocation.
.
[**12-2**] Renal ultrasound
1. Numerous cysts within bilateral kidneys. The hyperdense
lesion on CT
corresponds to a simple-appearing cyst on ultrasound
2. No hydronephrosis.
.
Last Chest xray:
[**2116-10-3**]
The interpretation of this study is limited due to rotation of
the patient, the lateral aspect of the left hemithorax was not
included on this radiograph. Left lower lobe atelectasis has
probably increased. Right lower lobe atelectasis is unchanged.
Cardiomediastinal contours cannot be evaluated.


Brief Hospital Course:
74 yo female with severe end-stage COPD on home oxygen, dCHF, on
treatment for MAC with recent admission for COPD exacerbation
admitted with abdominal pain and severe constipation.

She was initially treated for severe constipation, and seen by
GI and palliative care.  Despite aggressive bowel regimen, she
continued to have severe obstipation.  Gastrograffin enema was
performed on the day of ICU transfer.  This also did not relieve
constipation.  On the day of transfer to the ICU, she developed
respiratory distress after a renal ultrasound.
.
ICU course:
Pt developed acute respiratory distress shortly after renal
ultrasound while in the waiting room.  Unclear cause, though
some iniciting factor that precitpated a COPD exacerbation.  She
was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for evaluation. She was started on
BiPAP and expressly stated she did not want to be intubated.
She was empircally started on broad spectrum antibiotics for PNA
and IV heparin for possible (though unlikely PE).  After family
meeting to discuss goals of care, it was decided with inclusion
of the patient in decision making to focus on the comfort of the
patient.  IV heparin and antibiotics were discontinued.  She
continued with oxygen, steroids, inhalers/nebulizers. She was
transferred to the floor.  Palliative care following.
.
She returned to the medical floor on [**12-4**] to my service.  She
was comfort measures.  She was enrolled in inpatient hospice.
She expired peacefully, with her daughter [**Name (NI) **] at her bedside,
at 9:39 on [**2116-12-6**].  Autopsy was declined.
