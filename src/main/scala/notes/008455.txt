Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea on exertion

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2198-3-9**] - 1. Mitral valve replacement with a [**Street Address(2) 7163**]. [**Hospital 923**]
Medical Biocor tissue valve. 2. Coronary artery bypass grafting
x2 with a left internal mammary artery graft to left anterior

History of Present Illness:
84 year old female with a well known history of mitral valve
regurgitation followed by serial echocardiogram. She was
evaluated for a cough in early [**2198-1-13**] and was noted to be
in mild congestive heart failure. She was prescribed cipro for
possible pneumonia. Symptoms include dyspnea on exertion such as
climbing stairs, or carrying a laundry basket.  As she began to
develop a dilated left ventricle last year, the recommendation
for surgery had already been made however she was reluctant to
proceed. Given her severe mitral regurgitation, she has been
referred for surgical management.

Pertinent Results:
[**2198-3-9**] ECHO
PRE-BYPASS: The left atrium is moderately dilated. No
spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the
left atrium or left atrial appendage. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
and cavity size are normal. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%). The right ventricular
cavity is mildly dilated with mild global free wall hypokinesis.
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
There are three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) are mildly thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are moderately thickened. There is moderate/severe
anteriorly directd leaflet mitral valve prolapse. There is
partial P2 mitral leaflet flail. Severe (4+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. Due to the eccentric nature of the
regurgitant jet, its severity may be significantly
underestimated (Coanda effect). There is no pericardial
effusion.

POST:
1. Preserved [**Hospital1 **]-ventricular systolic function with backgrounf\d
inotropic support
2. Bioprosthetic valve in aortic position. Well seated and
stable with good leaflet excursion. Trace valvular
regurgitation. Mean gradient = 7 mm Hg
3. Intact aorta
4. No other change

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2198-3-9**] for surgical
management of her mitral regurgitaion and coronary artery
disease. She was taken directly to the operating room where she
underwent coronary artery bypass grafting to two vessels and a
mitral valve replacement. Please see operative note for details.
In summary she had:
1. Mitral valve replacement with a [**Street Address(2) 7163**]. [**Hospital 923**] Medical Biocor
tissue valve.
2. Coronary artery bypass grafting x2 with a left internal
mammary artery graft to left anterior descending and reverse
saphenous vein graft diagonal branch.
Her bypass time was 93 minutes with a crossclamp of 80 minutes.
She tolerated the operation well and postoperatively she was
taken to the intensive care unit for monitoring.
On postoperative day one, Ms. [**Known lastname **] [**Last Name (Titles) 5058**] neurologically intact
and was extubated without incident. She was slowly weaned off
pressors over the next several days. All lines and drains were
discontinued per cardiac surgery protocol. She was gently
diuresed towards her preoperative weight. She continued to
progress and was transferred to the step down unit on POD4 for
further monitoring. The physical therapy service was consulted
for assistance with her postoperative strength and mobility. She
developed post-operative atrial fibrillation which was treated
with beta blockade and Amiodarone as well as anticoagulation
with Coumadin. The remainder of her postoperative course was
essentially uneventful.
On POD7 she was discharged to Newbridge on the [**Hospital **]
Rehabilitation. All follow up appointments were advised.
