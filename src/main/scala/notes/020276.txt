Service: CARDIOTHORACIC

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1561**]
Chief Complaint:
shortness of breath, recurrent pneumonia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Right thoracotomy with posterior membranous wall
    tracheoplasty with Marlex mesh.
2.  Bilateral bronchoplasty with mesh.
3.  Flexible bronchoscopy [**10-19**], [**10-16**], [**10-15**], am and pm.


History of Present Illness:
81-year-old woman who has had a lifelong problem with
respiratory problems. She has had multiple pulmonary
infections including multiple episodes of bronchitis yearly
requiring antibiotic therapy. For the last several years, the
episodes of bronchitis have become increasingly frequent to
the point where she is now on rotating antibiotic therapy.
She has suffered from recurrent bronchitis and pneumonia. She
has also suffered from dyspnea. She has difficulty clearing
secretions and dyspnea on exertion. She was diagnosed on
flexible bronchoscopy of having tracheomalacia. She underwent
extensive evaluation for the tracheomalacia protocol. This
included dynamic airway CT scan, functional bronchoscopy and
a stenting trial as well as respiratory questionnaire and 6
minute walk test before and after stenting. Unfortunately,
the stent had to be removed due to stent associated
complications prior to adequate evaluation. She did, however,
have an excellent result initially in terms of improvement in
her dyspnea.  After extensive discussions, we ultimately
decided to take her forward for surgery to avoid the problems
associated with long term antibiotic use and prevent
recurrent infections which would undoubtably be progressive
in number and intensity.

the absence of ischemic EKG changes at the achieved workload (7
minutes of [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 4001**] protocol (4.8 METS).
1) Normal myocardial perfusion.  2) Normal left ventricular
cavity size and function.

[**1-12**]: Catheterization: 1. Selective coronary arteriography of
this right dominant system demonstrated no obstructive coronary
artery disease. The LMCA was patent. The LAD had minimal luminal
irregularities. The LCX had minimal luminal irregularities;
there was a large high OM (nearly a ramus). The RCA had a focal
mid-vessel 40% stenosis.
  2. Resting hemodynamics demonstrated normal right and left
filling pressures, with mean RA 6 mmHg, PA 32/16 mmHg, mean PCWP
12 mmHg, LVEDP 18 mmHg. The resting cardiac index was 3.1
L/min/m2.

[**1-12**]:Exercise MIBI: IMPRESSION: Probably angina without ischemic
ECG changes to the achieved workload/70% predicted maximum heart
rate.  1) Mild, reversible defect in the inferior wall.  2) Left

ventricular ejection fraction calculated to be 73%

CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2150-10-20**] 11:07 AM
[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
82 year old woman with tracheobronchmalasia s/p tracheoplasty
[**10-12**], now s/p bronch and s/p right CT d/c
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
eval for infiltrates
2 views chest [**2150-10-20**].
COMPARISON: [**10-19**].
INDICATION: Status post tracheoplasty procedure.

The heart size is normal, there is no evidence of mediastinal or
hilar lymphadenopathy. There is a stable small right pleural
effusion, and there are very minimal atelectatic changes at the
right lung base. On the lateral view, there is also note made of
a small left pleural effusion. No pneumothoraces are evident.
Scoliosis is noted.

IMPRESSION: Small pleural effusions, right greater than left.

PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:  Tracheal bronchial malacia.

POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  Tracheal bronchial malacia.

PROCEDURES PERFORMED:
1.  Right thoracotomy with posterior membranous wall
    tracheoplasty with Marlex mesh.
2.  Bilateral bronchoplasty with mesh.
3.  Flexible bronchoscopy.

ASSISTANT SURGEON:  Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1005**].

ANESTHESIA:  General endotracheal supplemented by thoracic
epidural.

INDICATIONS FOR OPERATION:  The patient is a delightful 81-
year-old woman who has had a lifelong problem with
respiratory problems. She has had multiple pulmonary
infections including multiple episodes of bronchitis yearly
requiring antibiotic therapy. For the last several years, the
episodes of bronchitis have become increasingly frequent to
the point where she is now on rotating antibiotic therapy.
She has suffered from recurrent bronchitis and pneumonia. She
has also suffered from dyspnea. She has difficulty clearing
secretions and dyspnea on exertion. She was diagnosed on
flexible bronchoscopy of having tracheomalacia. She underwent
extensive evaluation for the tracheomalacia protocol. This
included dynamic airway CT scan, functional bronchoscopy and
a stenting trial as well as respiratory questionnaire and 6
minute walk test before and after stenting. Unfortunately,
the stent had to be removed due to stent associated
complications prior to adequate evaluation. She did, however,
have an excellent result initially in terms of improvement in
her dyspnea.  After extensive discussions, we ultimately
decided to take her forward for surgery to avoid the problems
associated with long term antibiotic use and prevent
recurrent infections which would undoubtably be progressive
in number and intensity. She is therefore taken forward for
the following procedure.

DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:  The patient was taken to the
operating room, placed under general endotracheal anesthesia
with a single lumen endotracheal tube. I flexibly
bronchoscoped the patient and examined the
