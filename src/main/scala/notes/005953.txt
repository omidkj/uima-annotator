HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 64-year-old
gentleman admitted to the Trauma SICU from the Emergency Room
having had positive ETOH level and fell from a standing
position striking the back of his head with positive loss of
consciousness.  His sister reports he was done for 20 minutes
and actually stopped breathing during this time.  EMS was
dispatched and the patient was transported to [**Hospital6 1760**] where a head CT showed a
positive subarachnoid hemorrhage and bifrontal contusion.
The patient was combative on arrival.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Bell's palsy
2.  Status post stroke two years ago

EXAM:
NEUROLOGIC:  The patient was awake and alert, oriented to
self, date and occasionally to place.  Moves all extremities
purposely and strongly.  Belligerent at times.
CARDIOVASCULAR:  Stable respiratory rate.
LUNGS:  Clear.
GASTROINTESTINAL:  Abdomen soft, nondistended.
NECK:  Supple.

IMAGING:  All trauma x-rays were negative.  The patient had
repeat head CT on [**2197-7-29**] which showed increase in size of
contusions consistent with early blossoming of
intraparenchymal hemorrhage.  The patient was transferred to
the regular floor on [**2197-7-30**] where he continued to require
heavy doses of Ativan for DTs and a 1 to 1 sitter with severe
agitation.  The patient also had an episode of congestive
heart failure on [**2197-7-31**], was given intravenous Lasix.
Repeat head CT on [**2197-8-1**] again shows increase in the
hemorrhage and contusions in the bifrontal lobes.  No mass
effect.  Chest x-ray - alveolar and interstitial pulmonary
edema consistent with congestive heart failure, but no
infiltrates.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was evaluated by physical
therapy and occupational therapy and found to require
cognitive rehabilitation prior to discharge.  The patient was
seen by psychiatry service secondary to his DTs and his
belligerent behavior.  He was started on Haldol and his
Ativan was decreased.  He continued to be delirious as of
[**2197-8-6**], continued to be treated with Haldol and requiring
less Ativan for the DTs.  The patient continued to require
large doses of Haldol as of [**2197-8-11**].  The patient had
received 26 mg in a 24 hour period of Haldol for agitation.

The patient continued to be impulsive and not easily
redirectable, continued on a 1 to 1 sitter. Psychiatry
feeling that this was related to his head injury and less
likely due to DTs at this point.  The patient was also
evaluated by behavioral neurology service who recommended
traumatic brain injury rehabilitation and continue Haldol.
Long term prognosis was felt to be limited due to his age and
the size of his contusion, but short term improvement was
thought to be good.

The patient's neurologic status steadily improved to the
point where the patient's 1 to 1 sitter was weaned slowly.
First, the patient's sitter sat outside the room and then on
[**2197-8-16**] the sitter was discontinued.  That afternoon, the
patient left the hospital and was able get himself home by
cab without knowledge of the hospital staff.  He was pink
papered and brought back to the Medical Center and has been
on sitters since his return to the hospital.  He is,
though,so more cooperative and appropriate, oriented x3,
requiring still large doses of Haldol currently.  He is
receiving 12 mg of Haldol and was started on Risperdal
starting at 2 mg q hs, BuSpar 10 mg po tid and Zoloft 50 mg
po q day.  The patient will require close follow up for
weaning Haldol and increasing Risperdal and will require
outpatient rehabilitation services and follow up with his
primary care physician.  [**Name Initial (NameIs) **]'s recommendations for
