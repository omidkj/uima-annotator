to [**Hospital6 204**] with shortness of breath who
presented in congestive heart failure with increasing dyspnea
on exertion.  He had a catheterization done at [**Hospital3 **]
on [**10-11**] which showed normal left ventricular function,
moderate left main disease, and [**2-15**]+ mitral regurgitation.
He also ruled in for myocardial infarction by CPKs and
troponins.  He was transferred to [**Hospital6 649**] following his catheterization for coronary
artery bypass grafting.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Coronary artery disease.  Right bundle
branch block.  Non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.
Kidney cysts.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Aspirin 325 q.d., Altace 5 q.d.,
Lipitor 10 q.h.s., Glucophage 500 b.i.d.

ALLERGIES:  NO KNOWN DRUG ALLERGIES.

CARDIAC CATHETERIZATION:  Done at [**Hospital3 **] showed an
ejection fraction of 77% with a cardiac output of 4.7, [**2-15**]+
mitral regurgitation, left main 40-50%, left anterior
descending 50-70%, right coronary artery 90% proximally.
Electrocardiogram was sinus rhythm at 80, with normal PR,
QRS, and QT intervals.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs:  On admission temperature
was 98.9??????, heart rate 87, respirations 20, oxygen saturation
93% on room air.  General:  The patient was alert and
oriented times three.  HEENT:  Pupils equal, round and
reactive to light.  Chest:  Clear to auscultation
bilaterally.  Heart:  Regular, rate and rhythm.  There was a
loud systolic ejection murmur.  Abdomen: Soft, nontender,
nondistended.  Positive bowel sounds.  Extremities:  No
edema.

LABORATORY DATA:  On admission white count was 10.1,
hematocrit 49, platelet count 204; sodium 136, potassium 4.0,
chloride 101, CO2 24, BUN 17, creatinine 1.1, glucose 248; PT
12.6, PTT 27.4, INR 1.1.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the
Cardiothoracic Surgery Service.  The Dental Service was asked
to consult on the patient prior to his surgery, and he was
scheduled for coronary artery bypass grafting and mitral
valve replacement.  On [**10-13**], the patient was brought to
the Operating Room.  Please see OR report for full details.
In summary the patient had a coronary artery bypass grafting
times three with LIMA to the left anterior descending,
saphenous vein graft to the distal right coronary artery,
saphenous vein graft to OM, and mitral valve repair with a
#28 mm ...................-[**Doctor Last Name **] annuloplasty band.  He
tolerated the operation well and was transferred from the
Operating Room to the Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit.

The patient did well in the immediate postoperative period.
He was weaned from all of his cardioactive drugs.  His
anesthesia was reversed, and he was weaned from the
ventilator and successfully extubated.

On postoperative day #1, the patient continued to do well.
He remained hemodynamically stable.  His chest tubes were
removed, and he was transferred from the Cardiothoracic
Intensive Care Unit to ................ for continuing
postoperative care and cardiac rehabilitation.

Once on the floor, the patient had an uneventful hospital
course.  On a daily basis, with the assistance of physical
therapy and nursing staff, his activity level was increased
until on postoperative day #4, it was deemed that the patient
was stable and ready for discharge to home.  At that time,
the patient's condition was stable.

DISCHARGE PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs:  Temperature
98.3??????, heart rate 73 in sinus rhythm, blood pressure 130/59,
respirations 18, oxygen saturation 93% on room air.
Preoperative weight 74 kg, discharge 82 kg.  General:  He was
alert and oriented times three.  He moves all extremities.
He follows commands.  He was conversant.  Respiratory:  Clear
