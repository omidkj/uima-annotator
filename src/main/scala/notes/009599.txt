Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the hospital and brought to the
operating room on [**2150-9-30**] where the patient underwent mitral
valve repair with 30 mm CE PysioRing II. Overall the patient
tolerated the procedure well and post-operatively was
transferred to the CVICU in stable condition for recovery and
invasive monitoring. POD 1 found the patient extubated, alert
and oriented and breathing comfortably.  The patient was
neurologically intact and hemodynamically stable on no inotropic
or vasopressor support.  Beta blocker was initiated and the
patient was gently diuresed toward the preoperative weight. He
was hypertensive postoperatively and on a Nicardipene drip and
weaned off this on post operative day 1 with titration of oral
antihypertensives. He had 3 short bursts of rapid atrial
fibrillation on post operative day 1 and was started on
Amiodarone drip.  This was transitioned to po Amiodarone without
any further episodes of afib.  The patient was transferred to
the telemetry floor for further recovery.  Chest tubes and
pacing wires were discontinued without complication.  The
patient was evaluated by the physical therapy service for
assistance with strength and mobility.  By the time of discharge
on POD 4 the patient was ambulating freely, the wound was
healing and pain was controlled with oral analgesics.  The
patient was discharged home with visiting nurse services in good
condition with appropriate follow up instructions.
