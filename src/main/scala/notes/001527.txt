IMAGING:
[**8-25**] Head CT: No acute intracranial process

[**8-25**] CT chest/abdomen/pelvis:
1. Moderate bilateral pleural effusions associated with
bibasilar opacities, likely reflective of atelectasis.
2. Irregular endplate changes involving the T5 inferior endplate
and T6
superior endplate. Given the history of bacterial endocarditis,
discitis and osteomyelitis are not excluded. If clinically
indicated, an MRI is suggested.
3. Retroperitoneal adenopathy.

[**8-28**] MRI T-spine:
1. Findings concerning for infection involving T4, T5 and T6
vertebral body,
more predominant at T5, T6 intervertebral space. No appreciable
epidural
collection, however limited evaluation due to absence of IV
contrast.
2. Worsening paraspinal soft tissue thickening and edema at T5-6
level.
3. Slightly worse bilateral pleural effusions.

ECHO([**2105-8-26**]): The left atrium and right atrium are normal in
cavity size. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and
regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are
normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal
with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. No
masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve, but cannot
be fully excluded due to suboptimal image quality. The mitral
valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral
regurgitation. There is no mitral valve prolapse. No masses or
vegetations are seen on the mitral valve, but cannot be fully
excluded due to suboptimal image quality. The estimated
pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. IMPRESSION: No
valvular pathology or pathologic flow identified. Normal
biventricular cavity sizes with preserved global and regional
biventricular systolic function.


Brief Hospital Course:
32 yo male with recent hospitalization for MSSA bacteremia,
presumed endocarditis and septic pulmonary emboli who presents
from rehab with altered mental status and found to have new
acute renal failure.

# ALTERED MENTAL STATUS: Intubated [**1-20**] AMS in outside hospital.
On HD 2 he was extubated with difficulty. His mental status did
not remain an issue while in the MICU. Likely etiology felt to
be secondary to uremia in setting of pre-renal ARF secondary to
significant diarrhea prior to admission. As his renal failure
improved, his mental status improved. Patient also continued to
receive renally cleared sedating medications prior to admission
which may have contributed to AMS even further. These
medications were initially held and slowly re-introduced.
Negative CT torso, negative trans-thoracic echo, negative
blood/urine cultures and negative lumbar puncture. Only
significant finding on LP was a slightly elevated filling
pressure of 25.5 mm Hg.  Pt was found to have
osteomyelitis/discitis on T-spine MRI and was transitioned from
vanco/cefepime to nafcillin per ID recommendations to complete a
6 week course.

#. Osteomyelitis/Discitis T5/T6: Identified on MRI. Pt without
evidence of epidural abscess. No pain on exam or neurologic
deficit. Pt initially treated with Vanc/Cefepime and narrowed to
nafcillin given previous MSSA bacteremia prior to discharge. Pt
will complete a 6 week course of Nafcillin 2grams Q4hours.
Safety labs will be monitored by the ID outpatient clinic and
patient will follow up with ID in the coming weeks.

# ARF: Initially elevated to 4.8 on arrival with baseline of
0.9. ARF seems to have begun around [**8-22**]. Improved with IVFs
consistent with pre-renal etiology. Patient and family noted a
history of extensive diarrhea prior to hospitalization. Renal
function improved with hydration.

#. Diarrhea: Stool Cultures revealed Blastocystisi Hominis.
Diarrhea improved without therapy.

# H/O MSSA Bacteremia: Initial concern for re-infection.
Empirically started on vancomycin and cefepime. Blood cultures
negative for MSSA while in the MICU. Dental surgery was
consulted for assessment of tooth infections that patient did
not treat in the outpatient as was planned. It was not felt that
his infections had acutely worsened and not likely to be causing
his symptoms. He should follow up with dental in the outpatient
for extraction of infected teeth. The number to call:
[**Telephone/Fax (1) 68463**].  Blood cultures from OSH also negative;
osteo/discitis treated w/nafcillin, presumably [**1-20**] seeding from
bacteremia.

# Coffee Ground NG suction: Noted while intubated. Started on
protonix. Will need to f/u with GI as outpatient after discharge
from rehab hospital. Hematocrit stable during hospitalization
without evidence of bleeding.

# H/O IVDU: Initially held methadone given AMS, however
re-introduced on HD 3. Gabapentin held and gently reintroduced
beginning [**8-28**] and increased to 800mg three times daily.
Patient's last dose of methadone prior to admission was 40 mg
daily. No evidence of withdrawal during hospitalization; did not
require lorazepam for CIWA.

# BIPOLAR: Continued citalopram. Risperdol held and seroquel
decreased to 50mg QHS. Restarting Risperdol and uptitration of
seroquel should be addressed as an outpatient.

Medications on Admission:
Benadryl 25mg PO QHS
Methadone 40mg daily
Clonidine 0.1m
