Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1283**]
Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea on exertion

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2195-2-2**] Aortic Valve Replacement(25mm St. [**Male First Name (un) 923**] Epic Porcine
Valve)


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 1924**] is a 78 year old gentleman with increasing dyspnea on
exertion and decreased exercise tolerance over the last 6
months. Echocardiogram was notable for bicuspid aortic valve and
aortic stenosis with a peak gradient of 86mmHg. Subsequent
cardiac catheterization revealed only mild disease in the
circumflex coronary artery(30-40% stenosis). Coronary arteries
were otherwise free of disease. He now presents for aortic valve
replacement.

Past Medical History:
Bicuspid Aortic Valve, Aortic Stenosis
Mild Coronary Artery Disease
Hypertension
Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease
Prostate Cancer - s/p Cryotherapy and Radiation
History of Skin Cancer
Hernia Repair
Prior Eye Surgery


Social History:
Quit tobacco in [**2156**]. Admits to 1-2 beers daily. No history of
ETOH abuse. He is retired from the phone company but still works
part time moving cemetary monuments. He is married and lives
with his wife.

Family History:
No history of premature coronary artery disease.

Physical Exam:
PREOP PHYSICAL EXAM
Vitals: 152/82, 76 regular, 16
General: WDWN elderly male in no acute distress
HEENT: Oropharynx benign, EOMI
Neck: Supple, no JVD, transmitted murmur noted bilaterally
Lungs: CTA bilaterally, distant breath sounds at bases
Heart: Regular rate and rhythm, normal s1s2, 3/6 systolic murmur
Abdomen: Soft, nontender with normoactive bowel sounds
Ext: Warm, no edema
Pulses: 2+ distally
Neuro: Alert and oriented, CN 2- 12 grossly intact, no focal
deficits noted

Pertinent Results:
[**2195-2-2**] PRE-BYPASS TEE:
1. A patent foramen ovale is likely present. It appears that
there is intermittent left-to-right shunt across the interatrial
septum is seen at rest. With saline interrogation, without
valsalva maneuver there no definitive flow across the septum
could be seen.
2. There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The
left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
3. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal.
4. There are complex (mobile) atheroma in the aortic arch. The
descending thoracic aorta is mildly dilated. There are complex
(>4mm) atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
5. The aortic valve is bicuspid. There is severe aortic valve
stenosis (area <0.8cm2). Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
6. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Physiologic
mitral regurgitation is seen (within normal limits).

[**2195-2-2**] POST-BYPASS TEE:
1. A well-seated bioprosthetic valve is seen in the aortic
position with normal leaflet motion and a mean gradient of about
15 mm Hg with a maximum of about 24 mm Hg. Trace valvular aortic
regurgitation is seen.
2. Regional and global left ventricular systolic function are
normal.
3. Patent foramen ovale more clearly seen.

CHEST (PA & LAT)

Reason: ? effusion

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
78 year old man with s/p avr
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
? effusion
TWO VIEW CHEST RADIOGRAPH, [**2195-2-9**]:

COMPARISON: [**2194-2-4**].

INDICATION: Evaluate pleural effusion.

Cardiomediastinal contours are within normal limits. Small
lateral left basilar hydropneumothorax is identified. This is
not clearly visualized on the previous study but may not have
been visible due to differences in technique. Small right
pleural effusion has slightly decreased in size. Areas of
bibasilar atelectasis have markedly improved.

IMPRESSION:
1. Small left basilar hydropneumothorax.

2. Improving right pleural effusion and bibasilar atelectasis.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 1924**] was admitted and underwent an aortic valve
replacement by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1290**]. For surgical details, please see
seperate dictated operative note. Following the operation, he
was brought to the CVICU for invasive monitoring. Within 24
hours, he awoke neurologically intact and was extubated without
incident. His CVICU course was uneventful and he transferred to
the SDU on postoperative day one. On postoperative day two, he
was started on Amiodarone and coumadin for paroxsymal atrial
fibrillation. He successfully converted back to a normal sinus
rhythm. Beta blockade was gradually advanced as tolerated. He
was ready for discharge home on POD # 7.
