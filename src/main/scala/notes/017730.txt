Pertinent Results:
[**3-2**] Cath: 1. Selective coronary angiography of this right

limiting disease. 2. Resting hemodynamics demonstrated moderate
pulmonary artery hypertension (PA 49/13 mm Hg), elevated left
sided filling pressures (LVEDP 47 mm Hg), and systemic arterial
hypertension (central aortic pressure 147/42 mm Hg. 3. Aortic
valve calculated at 0.9 cm2, with cardiac output/index 4.37
l/min and 2.39 l/min/m2, mean gradient 21.7 mm Hg, systolic
ejection period 23.8, valve flow 183.65 ml/sec. 4. Wide pulse
pressure indicative of significant aortic insufficiency. FINAL
DIAGNOSIS: 1. Coronary arteries are normal. 2. Moderate aortic
mixed stenosis and regurgitation. 3. Severe diastolic
ventricular dysfunction.
[**3-1**] CNIS: 1. No significant interval change and no evidence of
significant ICA stenosis on either side. 2. Antegrade flow in
both vertebral arteries.
[**3-8**] Echo: PRE-CPB:1. The left atrium is moderately dilated. No
spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body of the left atrium
or left atrial appendage. No thrombus is seen in the left atrial
appendage. No thrombus is seen in the right atrial appendage No
atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. 2. Left
ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular
cavity is mildly dilated. 3. Right ventricular chamber size and
free wall motion are normal. 4. There are simple atheroma in the
aortic root. There are simple atheroma in the ascending aorta.
There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch. There are simple
atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. 5. There are three
aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets are severely
thickened/deformed. The annulus measures 21 mm. There is
moderate to severe aortic valve stenosis (area 0.8-1.0cm2). Mild
(1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. 6. The mitral valve leaflets
are moderately thickened. There is severe mitral annular
calcification. There is mild valvular mitral stenosis (area
1.5-2.0cm2). Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen at a
systolic pressure of 130 that is 1+ at a systolic pressure of
100 mmHg. Drs [**First Name (STitle) 6507**], [**Name5 (PTitle) 3318**] and [**Name5 (PTitle) 5209**] were in the OR to
discuss the findings with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in person of the results.
POST-CPB: On infusions of epinephrine, phenylephrine. AV pacing.
Well-seated bioprosthetic valve in the aortic position. No AI.
Gradient now 34 peak, 20 mean on inotropic support. MR is now
trace. Preserved biventricular systolic function. Aortic contour
is normal post decannulation.

Brief Hospital Course:
Upon admission to the medicine service, Ms. [**Known lastname 1683**] was treated
with a Solu-Medrol taper for a resolving chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease exacerbation.  She was then transferred to
cardiology for cardiac catheterization in preparation for an
aortic valve repair.  On [**2181-2-28**] she was intubated for
respiratory distress and hypoxemia and was transferred to the
cardiac care unit.  She was diuresed and extubated by the
following day.  She was seen in consultation by cardiac surgery
to evaluate her for aortic valve replacement. Her subsequent
cardiac catheterization on [**3-3**] revealed no significant coronary
artery disease.  She was diuresed with a Lasix drip.  She was
also seen in consultation by endocrinology for a nodule on her
thyroid.  It was recommended that after her heart surgery, this
nodule be ablated.

On [**2181-3-8**] she was taken to the operating room and underwent an
aortic valve replacement with a CE magna tissue valve.  Please
see operative report for surgical details. Following surgery she
was transferred to the CVICU for invasive monitoring in stable
condition. She did require blood transfusions due to low HCT.
Within 24 hours she was weaned from sedation, awoke
neurologically intact and extubated. But shortly after she had
increased rhonchi with respiratory acidosis and need to be
re-intubated. She was again weaned and extubated the following
day. she remained int he CVICU for several mores days while
receiving aggressive pulmonary toilet and diuresis. On post-op
day three chest tubes were removed. Post-operatively she
continued to have arrhythmias which were also seen upon
admission. Therefore she was started on Coumadin with heparin
bridge. Electrophysiology was eventually consulted. Epicardial
pacing wires were removed on post-op day four and she was then
transferred to the telemetry floor for further care. She
continued to slowly recover over the next several days while
awaiting for her INR to be therapeutic ([**2-20**]). She worked with
physical therapy and appeared ready for discharge on post-op day
five.
