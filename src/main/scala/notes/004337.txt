RADIOLOGY   Preliminary Report

CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2113-8-29**] 11:08 AM

CHEST (PA & LAT)

Reason: s/p CT removal ? ptx

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
68 year old man with AS,AVR
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
s/p CT removal ? ptx
HISTORY: 68-year-old male with aortic stenosis and aortic valve
replacement, status post chest tube removal, question
pneumothorax.

COMPARISON: Radiographs [**2113-8-28**].

TWO VIEWS OF THE CHEST BY PORTABLE TECHNIQUE: There is a small
right pleural effusion and a small-to-moderate left pleural
effusion. There is a right internal jugular catheter, the tip of
which is in the SVC. There is no change in the cardiomediastinal
contour. No pneumothorax is identified.

IMPRESSION: Small right pleural effusion and small-to-moderate
left pleural effusion. No pneumothorax.

UNILAT UP EXT VEINS US LEFT

Reason: r/o dvt - swelling

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
68 year old man s/p CABG, MVR, AVR, ASc Aorta, sternal
debridement
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
r/o dvt - swelling
INDICATION: 68-year-old man with left arm swelling, rule out
DVT.

COMPARISON: No previous extremity ultrasound for comparison.

FINDINGS: [**Doctor Last Name **]-scale, color and Doppler son[**Name (NI) 1417**] of the left
jugular, subclavian, axillary, brachial, basilic, and cephalic
veins were performed. There is thrombus identified in the left
cephalic below the level of the antecubital fossa. At this
level, the vein demonstrates no flow and does not compress.
There is normal flow, compression, and augmentation in the
remainder of the left arm vessels. No deep vein thrombus is
identified in any of the deep veins.

IMPRESSION: No DVT in the left arm. Thrombus is identified in
the left cephalic vein, which is a superficial vein, below the
level of the antecubital fossa.

Cardiology Report ECG Study Date of [**2113-8-25**]  12:07:14 AM


Probable sinus tachycardia, though atypical atrial flutter
cannot be excluded.
Right bundle-branch block with left anterior fascicular block.
Possible prior
inferior wall myocardial infarction. Compared to the previous
tracing of [**2113-8-24**]
the ventricular rate is now regular suggesting either sinus
tachycardia or
atypical atrial flutter. Otherwise, no diagnostic interim
change.

CT CHEST W/O CONTRAST

Reason: assess lft effusion/adhesions

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
68 year old man s/p AVR/MVR/CABG/Ao root [**Doctor First Name **] reexplored
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
assess lft effusion/adhesions
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.

INDICATION: 68-year-old male status post AVR/MVR/CABG/aortic
root, status post surgical re-exploration. Please assess left
effusion, and adhesions.

COMPARISON: Multiple chest radiographs dating back to [**2113-7-25**].

TECHNIQUE: MDCT-acquired axial imaging of the chest without
intravenous contrast. Multiplanar reformatted images were
obtained and reviewed.

FINDINGS: There is evidence of previous cardiac surgery, and
re-exploration. Mediastinal wires have been removed, along with
a portion of the left hemisternum, and there has been closure
with a omental/pectoral muscle flap. The flap is relatively
large, and appears to displace mediastinal structures
posteriorly. Within the soft tissue of the flap, there is a
moderate amount of soft tissue stranding, which most likely
correlates with post-surgical edema, but could also represent
residual of old hemorrhage. There is no large fluid collection
or other sign of active bleeding. Two drains are seen within
this flap, situated anterior to the sternum bilaterally. A third
drain is seen within the flap situated deep, and adjacent to the
pericardium.

There are small bilateral pleural effusions which contain simple
fluid, slightly greater on the left. There is adjacent left
basilar atelectasis. There is also a small simple pericardial
effusion.

There is heavy atherosclerotic calcification of the native
coronary arteries. The aortic root graft is unremarkable on this
non-contrast enhanced CT.

There are bilateral chest tubes. Chest tube on the right is
situated within the major fissure. There is a small right
pneumothorax. Left chest tube is situated laterally, near the
apex. There is a tiny left hydropneumothorax near the chest tube
tip.

Other than small amount of left basilar atelectasis described
above, the lungs are clear. Central bronchi are patent to the
subsegmental level. Endotracheal tube and nasogastric tube are
in appropriate positions. There is a small amount of soft tissue
anasarca.

Limited views of the upper abdomen are notable for surgical
clips anterior to the stomach. There is a small volume of
ascites surrounding the liver. There is mild elevation of the
left hemidiaphragm, possibly related to left basilar
atelectasis.
