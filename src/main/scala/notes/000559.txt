Chief Complaint:
Aspirin Desensitization

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac Catheterization


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 78172**] is a 68 yo male with history of dilated
cardiomyopathy, pulmonary embolism, severe asthma and severe
diffuse tracheobronchomalacia s/p tracheobronchoplasty, who
presents today for aspirin desensitization prior to RHC/LHC to
evaluate coronaries and pressures.

Based on previous cardiac MRI, there seems to be disease within
the coronaries, and possibly evidence of scar of the myocardium.
 A previous ECHO showed an EF of approx 25%, but CMR EF was
approx 40%.  He is being evaluated for ischemic cardiomyopathy.

On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, bleeding at the time of surgery,
myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red
stools. S/he denies recent fevers, chills or rigors. S/he denies
exertional buttock or calf pain.  he denies chest pain, DOE,
PND, Orthopnea, palpitations or presyncope.  All of the other
review of systems were negative.  (+) include postnasal drop
with resultant intermittent cough.  neck stiffness resolving w/
movement.

Per OMR not from Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], "he has been working several days
in the construction business for up to 4 hours at a time without
limiting symptoms. He is also active at home, taking care of his
horses, carrying heavy hay bales, and ascending the [**Doctor Last Name **] to his
barn without chest discomfort, dyspnea on exertion, fatigue,
lightheadedness, or any palpitations."  This was confirmed with
patient and is unchanged.

STUDIES
EKG:  Sinus rhyth, LAD, possible LVH. TwI V1. V1-V4 nonspecific
repolrization anl.

2D-[**Month/Day/Year **] [**2187-5-16**]:
The left atrial volume is markedly increased (>32ml/m2). The
left atrium is dilated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are
normal. The left ventricular cavity is moderately dilated.
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more
depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
Diastolic function could not be assessed. Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic root is
moderately dilated at the sinus level. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and
no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is
no pericardial effusion. EF 20-25%.
IMPRESSION: Severe global left ventricular hypokinesis with
moderate to severe mitral regurgitation and moderate left
ventricular dilatation. Mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension with preserved right ventricular systolic function.

CARDIAC MRI [**2187-7-4**]:
Impression:
1. Mildly increased left ventricular cavity size with mild
global hypokinesis and more pronounced hypokinesis of the basal
to mid portion of the septum. The LVEF was mildly decreased at
41%. There was patchy mid-myocardial late gadolinium enhancement
of the basal to mid portion of the septum.
2. Normal right ventricular cavity size and systolic function.
The RVEF was normal at 60%.
3. Mild pulmonic regurgitation.
4. The indexed diameters of the ascending and descending
thoracic aorta were mildly increased and normal, respectively.
The main pulmonary artery diameter index was mildly increased.
5. Biatrial enlargement.
6. Normal coronary artery origins. There were lesions noted in
the proximal LAD, proximal LCx, and mid RCA.

Cardiac cath [**2187-12-11**]:
COMMENTS:
1. Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system
revealed
single vessel coronary artery disease. The LMCA was normal. The
LAD was
normal, but gave of a D1 with 80% stenosis. The LCx was normal.
THe RCA
was normal.
2. Resting hemodynamics revealed normal right sided filling
presures
with a RVEDP of 9mm Hg and slightly low left sided filling
pressures
with a LVEDP of 9mm Hg. Systemic vascular resistance was
decreased at 11
[**Doctor Last Name **] unit. The PVR was also decreased at 0.9 [**Doctor Last Name **] unit.
Systemic
arterial pressures were low at 98/68mm Hg. The baseline cardiac
output
and cardiac index were 6.6 L/min and 3.3 L/min/m2, respectively.

3. Pericardial calcifications were noted.
4. Patient had a severe vagal reaction during the procedure,
requiring
atropine (2m IV) and transient dopamine support.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. One vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Low filling pressures.


Brief Hospital Course:
68 yo male with h/o h/o dilated cardiomyopathy, PE,
tracheobronchomalacia s/p tracheobronchoplasty, who presents for
aspirin desensitization and RHC/LHC to evaluate for ischemic
cardiomyopathy

# CORONARIES:  Based on CMR, it seems there are lesions noted in
the proximal LAD, prox LCX and mid RCA with enhancement of the
basal to mid portion of septum which could be c/w scar.  Given
these findings, and previous ECHO with EF 25%, there is a
concern for ischemic cardiomyopathy.  Patient admitted for ASA
desensitization with eventual goal of LHC/RHC to evaluate
coronaries and cardiac pressures.  The patient underwen
