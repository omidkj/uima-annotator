Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 832**]
Chief Complaint:
respiratory failure

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Bronchoscopy
Intubation
Hemodialysis after HD line placement

History of Present Illness:
61 year-old female with ESRD on HD, Stage IV NSLC lung cancer
(EGFR wild type), DM2, HTN who presents with respiratory
distress.

Patient was with cough and not feeling well this AM. She went to
dialysis where she was coughing intensely to the point that the
needles came out of her AV graft. She appeared short of breath.
Unclear what EMS course was. Upon presentation to the ED, her
eyes were open but she was none verbal. Some history obtained by
cousin in [**Name (NI) **].

Of note, her lung cancer involves the right upper lobe mass and
adjacent hilar/mediastinal/supraclavicular nodes. Patient met
with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in [**Month (only) **], who started vinorelbin for
palliative chemotherapy about 2 weeks ago.

In addition, patient's admit weight was 62 kg with an estimated
dry weight of 58 kg.

ED Course:
Initial VS at 11:40 on [**10-21**] were T 97.7 HR 100 BP 181/69 RR 32
Sat 84 %. She triggered for respiratory distress. Eyes were open
but non-verbal. There was a question about intubation/code
status. ED physician spoke to next of [**Doctor First Name **] (Mr.[**Last Name (Titles) 732**]). He stated
that she would want to be intubated. Intubated with 7.5 ETT with
ricironium 60 mg and etomidate 20 mg. Sedation with versed and
propofol. After intubation, VS were 95, 125/59, 25, 99% on vent

CXR revealed RUL opacity. She was given ceftriaxone 1 gm IV x 1
and levofloxacin 750 mg IV x 1 initially followed by addition of
vancomycin 1 gm IV x 1 to cover HCAP. EKG showing Sinus Tach,
TWI V4-6, ? peaked T's.

.
On the floor, patient was sedation and tolerating ventilator
well. Renal was consulted for HD but noticed left graft not
functioning. Placed RIJ line for dialysis access. Dialysis was
going to be performed but hypotensive to MAPs ~ high 50s. CVP 4.
Propofol was switched to versed/fentanyl. Dialysis was not
performed. Patient subsequently underwent bronchoscopy with BAL
showing RL apical segmental occlusion (? tumor), 90 % anterior
segment occlusion, and patent posterior segment. Pressure
subsequently in 180s.

BRONCHIAL WASHING [**2200-10-21**]
NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.

ADMISSION EKG [**2200-10-21**]
Sinus tachycardia. Intraventricular conduction delay. Left
ventricular
hypertrophy. ST-T wave abnormalities may be due to
intraventricular conduction
delay, left ventricular hypertrophy and possible ischemia.
Clinical
correlation is suggested. Since the previous tracing of [**2200-7-29**]
sinus
tachycardia is now present and ST-T wave abnormalities are more
prominent.

CHEST X RAY [**2200-10-21**]
IMPRESSION: Multiple limitations as above. There is diffuse and
severe
pulmonary edema. A dense consolidation on the right may indicate
confluent
edema, although pneumonia or underlying mass lesion cannot be
excluded.

ECHO [**2200-10-22**]
The left atrium is normal in size. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is moderately depressed (LVEF= XX
%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but
aortic stenosis is not present. Trace aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is
no mitral valve prolapse. Physiologic mitral regurgitation is
seen (within normal limits). The tricuspid valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could
not be determined. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial
effusion.

IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric LVH with moderate to severe global
hypokinesis. Lateral wall function is relatively better. No
significant mitral regurgitation seen.

CHEST X RAY [**2200-10-24**]
There is now complete opacification of the right upper lung with
increase of
the right mediastinal shift. The findings are consistent with
interval
development of atelectasis but there is potentially some
additional cause that
precludes significant volume loss such as hemorrhage.
Correlation with
bronchoscopy is highly recommended. Position of tubes and lines
and the left
perihilar region opacities are unchanged.


Brief Hospital Course:
Assessment and Plan:  61 year-old female with ESRD on HD, Stage
IV NSCLC involving RUL, DM2, HTN who presents with acute
hypercarbic/hypoxic respiratory distress and RUL opacification
secondary to possible post-obstructive pneumonia in addition to
initial neutropenia.
