HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This 61-year-old male with a
history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease was admitted
to [**Hospital6 33**] on [**2171-10-20**], for an
exacerbation of her pulmonary problems.  [**Name (NI) **] underwent an
substernal chest pain; however, he was only able to complete
two minutes on [**Doctor First Name **] protocol before having ST depressions
and chest pain.  On [**10-24**], he underwent cardiac
catheterization which revealed a 60% to 70% stenosis of his
left main, as well as greater than 90% stenosis of his right
coronary artery, and greater than 60% of his left circumflex.

[**2171-10-25**], where he underwent coronary artery bypass
graft times three.  His postoperative course was somewhat
complicated by his chronic obstructive pulmonary disease;
however, he was managed with bronchodilators and antibiotics
for a left lower lobe consolidation and positive sputum for
hemophilus.

On [**2171-10-29**], the patient was discharged to a
rehabilitation facility in stable condition. While at that
facility, the patient and his wife were not satisfied with
the quality of care being provided there, and was brought to
[**Hospital3 417**] Hospital's Emergency Department with
complaints of chest discomfort which was exacerbated with
movement and coughing.  The Emergency Department evaluation
felt that his pain was due to his sternotomy incision and had
planned to discharge him back to the rehabilitation facility.
However, the patient and his wife did not agree to that.
Since there was some questionable cellulitis of his right
lower extremity, the patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 346**].  He had complained of low-grade
fever but denied chills, sweats, or any discharge from his
incision.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with multiple
hospitalizations and previous steroid use.
2.  Hypertension.
3.  Sleep apnea.
4.  Gout.
5.  Status post methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus
pneumonia.
6.  Status post appendectomy.
7.  Status post umbilical herniorrhaphy.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Medications upon admission to the
hospital were Lopressor 12.5 mg p.o. b.i.d., Lasix 40 mg p.o.
t.i.d., potassium chloride 20 mEq p.o. b.i.d., aspirin 81 mg
p.o. q.d., levofloxacin 500 mg p.o. q.d. times eight days,
Percocet one to two tablets p.o. q.3-4h. p.r.n. for pain,

Serevent inhaler 1 puff to 2 puffs q.4h. p.r.n., and
albuterol nebulizer treatment q.i.d. p.r.n.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Upon admission to the
hospital temperature was 99.2, pulse 76, normal sinus rhythm,
blood pressure 129/67, respiratory rate 20, oxygen saturation
91% on room air.  The patient was a 61-year-old male in no
apparent distress, was alert and oriented times three.  His
neck was supple with no bruits noted.  Lungs revealed wheezes
bilaterally.  His sternum was stable.  His incision was
clean, dry, and intact.  Coronary examination revealed a
regular rate and rhythm, with no murmurs, rubs or gallops.
The abdomen was soft, nontender, and nondistended.  His
extremities were warm and well perfused.  His incision was
clean, dry, and intact with no purulent discharge of
significant erythema.

LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION:   Laboratory values upon
admission to the hospital were white blood cell count 16.8,
hematocrit 28.4.  Potassium 4.6, BUN 18, creatinine 0.8.

HOSPITAL COURSE:   The patient was admitted to the hospital
for physical therapy as well as wound checks and pulmonary
toilet.

In the early morning on hospital day two ([**2171-10-31**]), the patient had some problems with disorientation
after receiving Ambien for sleep.  The patient did receive
some Haldol to treat this.  The patient remained
hemodynamically stable, and the patient was monitored by a
one-to-one sitter in his room.  Later in the day the patient
was alert and oriented, in no apparent distress.  He remained
to be wheezing bilaterally, but otherwise had an unremarkable
physical examination.

On [**2171-11-1**], the patient continued to have
intermittent periods of delirium.  It was noted upon physical
examination that day that there was a small sternal click at
the inferior portion of his sternum which was elicited with
coughing.  The patient's incision had remained clean, dry,
and intact.  His white blood cell count had risen to 18.6,
and the patient was fully cultured at that time.  Two blood
cultures which were obtained on [**2171-11-1**], revealed
coagulase-negative Staphylococcus aureus.  Sputum culture on
that same day was unremarkable.

Over the next few days, the patient had a low-grade fever
between 99 degrees and 101 degrees and continued to have a
sternal click without wound drainage or erythema.  The
patient was empirically started on vancomycin on
[**2171-11-2**], due to Staphylococcus species.  At that
time the cultures were not finalized; however, they
ultimately proved to oxacillin-resistant Staphylococcus
aureus.

On [**2171-11-3**], on hospital day five, postoperative
nine, the patient complained of a clicking painful sensation
in his chest.  This persisted throughout the next day as
well, on [**11-4**], when he continued to complain of
sternal discomfort.  The patient had completed his course of
levofloxacin and was on day three of vancomycin at that time.

On [**2171-11-5**], the patient continued to have a
sternal click with pain at the site and positive blood
cultures.  The patient was taken to the operating room on
[**2171-11-5**], due to sternal dehiscence.  He underwent
a sternal wound debridement with a Robicsek weave of his
sternum by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 70**].  Please see the Operative Report
for full details of surgical procedure.

The patient was extubated and brought to the Intensive Care
Unit where he remained for approximately 24 hours.  He
remained hemodynamically stable.  His white blood cell count
had dropped to 9.2.  On [**11-6**], his pulmonary status
was stable.  His creatinine had elevated slightly from a
baseline of 1.1 to 1.4 at this time.  He had adequate urine
output at the time and was transferred from the Intensive
Care Unit to the telemetry floor, [**Hospital Ward Name 121**] Six, on [**2171-11-6**].

On [**11-7**], on postoperative day two, the patient still
had complaints of pain; however, was hemodynamically stable.
His white blood cell count at that time was 13.5.  The
patient had remained essentially afebrile to having a
low-grade fever of about 100 degrees.  His oxygen saturation
was adequate, and his vital signs were stable.  The patient
was noted to have some serosanguineous drainage from the
middle portion of his sternal wound at that time.  The
patient was maintained on intravenous vancomycin for the
methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus which was noted
in his previous blood cultures.  He was given morphine for
pain control.  He was on Lopressor and was continuing to
diuresed.

On [**2171-11-8**], a peripherally inserted central
catheter line was inserted in the Interventional Radiology
Department because it was felt that the patient would need to
continue on a full 4-week to 6-week course of vancomycin.  On
[**2171-11-8**], the patient remained hemodynamically
stable; although, he was beginning to have an elevated fever
to 101.2, and he continued to complain of sternal pain.  He
was noted to still have mild amounts of serosanguineous
drainage fro his sternal incision.

On [**11-9**], on postoperative day four, the patient was
more comfortable.  He had been given Dilaudid for pain
control.  He was noted to have some degree of peri-incisional
erythema of his sternotomy incision.  His sternum was stable
at that time.  The patient had no other significant
complaints.  His white blood cell count was 12.4.  His
creatinine had risen again to 1.5 at this time.  He was still
being continued on vancomycin.  On [**2171-11-9**], the
house officer was called to see the patient due to agitation.
Upon arrival for examination the patient was alert and
orient
