Brief Hospital Course:
On [**2132-1-1**] Ms.[**Known lastname 84254**] was taken to the operating room for an
urgent coronary artery bypass graft x2(Left internal mammary
artery to left anterior descending artery and
saphenous vein graft to obtuse marginal artery)with Dr.[**First Name (STitle) **].
Cardiopulmonary Bypass time= 33 minutes. Cross Clamp time=26
minutes. She tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to
the CVICU intubated and sedated requiring levophed for optimal
cardiac support. She awoke neurologically intact and was
extubated on POD#1 without difficulty. Due to her history of
COPD, aggressive pulmonary hygiene post extubation was
initiated. Narcotics were discontinued due to confusion. Pain
controlled with Ultram. Weaned off pressors, started on
Beta-blockers/Statin/Aspirin and diuresis was initiated. All
lines and drains were discontinued in a timely fashion. She
continued to progress and was transferred to the step down unit
on [**2132-1-4**] for further monitoring. Physical Therapy was
consulted for evaluation of strength and mobility. The remainder
of her hospital admission was essentially uneventful. Due to her
baseline respiratory comprimise, she remains O2 dependent and
continues her steroid taper that was initiated preop by [**Doctor Last Name 11710**],
[**First Name7 (NamePattern1) 11709**] [**Initial (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. She was cleared for discharge to [**Hospital3 7665**]
by Dr.[**First Name (STitle) **] on POD# 6. All follow up appointments were advised.
