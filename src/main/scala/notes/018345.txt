Brief Hospital Course:
Patient was admitted with gastric contents draining from
abdominal wound. She was started on vancomycin and Zosyn and was
taken to the OR. On EGD, the G tube was found to be leaking and
was replaced. Please see operative note for further details.
Postoperatively, she was transferred to the TSICU. On POD 1, she
was transferred to the floor. On POD 2, tube feeds were started.
Nutrition was consulted for recommendations on tube feeds. On
POD 3, the wound was opened and a VAC dressing was placed. On
POD 4, her regular insulin sliding scale and Glargine were
restarted with improved glucose control. On POD5, her vanco and
Zosyn were d/c'd. She was started on Augmentin. On POD 6, her
VAC was changed and her wound was debrided. On POD 8, she was
evaluated by Speech & Swallow and cleared for regular diet. Her
trach was deemed too large for a Passy Muir valve. Plans were
made to downsize it; however, later in the day, she had an
episode of mucous plugging, for which a Code Blue was called,
and which resolved following suctioning. On POD 7, as she had
tolerated regular diet, her tube feeds were discontinued. On POD
8, the VAC dressing was changed and the wound debrided. It was
clean with serosanguinous drainage. She was stable for discharge
to rehab. She will complete a 7 day course of Augmentin on
[**2190-1-9**].
