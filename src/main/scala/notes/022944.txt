HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 66 year-old female
with a history of mitral regurgitation who had a mitral valve
repair and ring anuloplasty in [**2099-9-20**].  Since then she
recently presented with congestive heart failure and anemia.
The echocardiogram showed mitral stenosis.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1.  Atrial fibrillation.  2.
Congestive heart failure.  3.  Hypertension.  4.
Hyperlipidemia.  5.  Status post mitral valve repair with
anuloplasty ring.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Hysterectomy, cholecystectomy and eye
surgery.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Premarin, aspirin, Lopressor,
Lasix, Diovan and multivitamins.

PREOPERATIVE LABORATORIES:  Sodium 138, K 4.2, chloride 101,
CO2 29, BUN 21, creatinine 0.8, blood sugar 90.
Preoperatively, white blood cell count was 10.4, hematocrit
39.8 and a platelet count of 333,000.  INR was 1.1, PT was
normal.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient was regular rate and
rhythm with audible diastolic murmur.  The lungs were clear.
The abdominal examination was benign.  She had normal distal
pulses in her feet and no varicose disease.  Cardiac
catheterization showed an ejection fraction of 68% with PA
pressures of 63/26.  Mitral valve area was decreased and the
patient had normal coronaries.

HO[**Last Name (STitle) **] COURSE:  On [**6-8**] the patient underwent mitral
valve replacement with a mosaic tissue #25 mm valve through a
minimally invasive approach by Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) **].  The patient
was transferred to the Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit in
stable condition.  On postoperative day one the patient was
awake and following commands.  She received some repletion
with Hespan and was on Milrinone and was continued on her
perioperative Vancomycin.  Postoperatively, hematocrit was
24.8 with a K of 4.0, BUN 12 and a creatinine of 0.5.  Her
lungs were clear bilaterally.  She had some trace edema.  She
had palpable dorsalis pedis pulses.  Her incisions were
intact.  She was starting to wake up and sedation was held
with plans to extubate her during the day.  She was seen by
case management.  On postoperative day two his creatinine was
stable at 0.5.  Her hematocrit remained in the low 20s.  She
had some rhonchi.  She had normal heart sounds.  She had 1+
edema.  She remained on a nitroglycerin drip at 0.75 mics per
kilo per minute and was completing his perioperative
Vancomycin.

Her chest tubes were discontinued.  She started her Lasix
diuresis.  She remained on sliding scale insulin as needed.
Her diet was advanced.  She was seen by physical therapy and
had been extubated and was transferred out to the floor.  On
postoperative day three she had several episodes of atrial
fibrillation.  She received an Amiodarone bolus and
intravenous Lopresor and then switched to po Amiodarone.
Those were her two primary cardiac medications.  She had a
blood pressure of 120/85 with a heart rate of 62, sating 90%
on room air.  Hematocrit was stable at 25.  She had some
coarse breath sounds.  Her heart was regular rate and rhythm.
Her lytes were repleted and her Lopressor was increased to 50
mg po b.i.d.  She continued to work with physical therapy. On
postoperative day four she completed her antibiotics and had
no acute events over the 24 hour period.  She was
hemodynamically stable.  She was still sating on 89% on room
air and 95% with 1 liter.  She had bibasilar crackles.  Heart
was regular rate and rhythm.  Incision was clean, dry and
intact.  Extremities had trace edema.  Her pacing wires were
discontinued.  She continued to ambulate.  She continued her
diuresis and was screened for rehab.

On[**Last Name (STitle) 14810**]perative day five she again remained stable with a
good blood pressure and was now sating 91% on room air still
with some crackles.  Her incisions were clean, dry and
intact.  She had 2+ edema bilateral lower extremities. She
received Zofran times one dose for nausea with the plans to
try and discharge her the following day.  On postoperative
day six she did spike a temperature to 101.3 and remained
afebrile at 98.6.  Her urinalysis was negative.  She was now
sating 92% on room air with a blood pressure of 112/40 and
was in sinus rhythm at 70.  Her lungs were clear.  Heart
regular rate and rhythm.  Incisions were clean, dry and
intact with trace edema.  She remained afebrile and was
discharged to home on the 25th with instructions to follow up
with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) 42699**] in two weeks her primary care physician
and instructions to follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] in one
month in the office postoperatively.

Laboratories on discharge white blood cell count 9.5,
hematocrit 25.5, platelet count 257,000, K 5.1, BUN 23,
creatinine 0.7.  She was below her preoperative weight by 3
kilograms.  Her examination was benign.  Her extremities were
warm and well perfuse.  She still had a faint murmur.  Her
right thoracotomy site looked clean and intact.  She was

po q.d., Captopril 12.5 mg t.i.d., enteric coated aspirin 325
mg po q.d., Colace 100 mg po b.i.d., Amiodarone 400 mg po q
day, Lopresor 50 mg po b.i.d., Lasix 20 mg po b.i.d. times
seven days and then q.d., K-Ciel 20 milliequivalents po
b.i.d. times seven days and then q.d.  Single multivitamin

with pericardial valve.
2.  Status post mitral valve anuloplasty in [**2098**].
3.  History of congestive heart failure.
4.  History of atrial fibrillation.
5.  Hypertension.
6.  Hypercholesterolemia.

Again, the patient was discharged to home on [**2101-6-14**] in
