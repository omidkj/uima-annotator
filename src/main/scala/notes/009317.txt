[**Hospital1 18**] for burns she sustained on her legs 2/[**2127**].  At that time
she was found to be living in sub-optimal conditions with her
daughter in a run-down house which was poorly insulated
therefore needing a lot of space heaters that led to pts burns.

Physical Exam:
VS: T = 99.6
GENERAL: Thin elderly female with contracted upper extremities
Nourishment: at risk
Grooming: Fair
Mentation: Drowsy, opens eyes very briefly, repeatedly asks us
to leave her alone
Eyes:NC/AT, could not asses pupils since pt refused to really
open her eyes, EOMI without nystagmus, no scleral icterus noted

Ears/Nose/Mouth/Throat:- could not assess, pt refused to open
her mouth
Neck: supple,
Respiratory: Decreased BS througout with poor inspiratory effort

Cardiovascular: RRR, nl. S1S2, no M/R/G noted
Gastrointestinal: soft, mildly distended abdomen but non-tender,
normoactive bowel sounds, no masses or organomegaly noted.
Genitourinary:  deferred
Rectal: Vault empty of stool
Skin: Well healing venous ulcer on RLE. No pressure ulcer
Extremities: No C/C/E bilaterally, 2+ radial, 1 + DP pulses b/l.

Neurologic:
-mental status: Alert, oriented x 1. [**Location (un) 669**]. Unable to answer
any other questions. Not cooperative with care and refusing to
obey simple commands.
-cranial nerves: II-XII intact- no obvious facial droop.
-motor: contracted upper extremities. Would not relax them.
Unable to assess strength. Appears to move all extremities
appropriately.
No foley catheter/tracheostomy/PEG/ventilator support/chest
tube/colostomy
Psychiatric: Refusing care.

Pertinent Results:
Admission CXR ([**2129-7-28**]): Bilateral pleural effusions with
cardiomegaly. There is hazy indistinctness of the pulmonary
vasculature likely due to diffuse mild edema.  Early developing
pneumonia in the right lung base is difficult to entirely
exclude.

Chest CT ([**2129-7-29**]): No signs of pulmonary infarction. New
loculated right pleural effusion and adjacent atelectasis.
Near-complete resolution of lingular consolidation.  Hypodense
area in the superior pole of the left kidney cannot be further
evaluated. If evaluation is required, ultrasound of the abdomen
can be obtained.  Large simple cyst of the superior pole of
right kidney.  Unchanged severe pulmonary arterial hypertension.


ECHO ([**2129-8-2**]):
Mild symmetric LVH with normal cavity size.
Overall LV systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
RV cavity is markedly dilated with moderate global free wall
hypokinesis. Abnormal septal motion/position consistent with RV
pressure/volume overload. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are
mildly thickened but AS is not present. Mild (1+) AR is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) MR is
seen. Moderate [2+] TR is seen. There is moderate PA artery
systolic hypertension. Significant pulmonic regurgitation is
seen. The main PA is dilated. There is a small pericardial
effusion. The effusion appears circumferential.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2129-7-19**],
estimated PA pressures are higher. The severity of TR has
increased. The other previously described abnormalities are
still present.


Brief Hospital Course:
84-year old female recently discharged from the [**Hospital1 18**] for
hypoxia and hypotension [**12-27**] large main pulmonary artery PE on
Coumadin presenting with hypoxia.

1. Hypoxia [**12-27**] Acute CHF (combination of systolic and
diastolic): The patient presented with hypoxia with O2 sats in
the 80s likely from an exacerbation of CHF. Gentle diuresis
improved her O2 sats to the 90s on room air. The patient did
have a brief stay in the ICU.  Antibiotics were initially
started for empiric treatment of pneumonia, but discontinued [**12-27**]
low likelihood of having an infection given good clinical
condition, absence of fever, and no leukocytosis.  Patient's
euvolemic weight in the hospital is 70.6 kg (155 lbs.)

2. UTI:  Patient denied dysuria.  Equivocal UA on [**7-29**] with
increased WBC's on [**7-30**], but negative ucx. Treated with Cipro for
total of 3 days.  She ramains asymptomtic.  She is incontinent
of urine, but has known baseline urge incontinence.

3. Dementia/Delirium:  Chronic dementia. The patient was at
baseline with regard to dementia at the time of discharge. She
is at baseline only oriented to self.

4. Prior PE:  The patient is on anti-coagulation for prior
massive pulmonary artery pulmonary embolism.  Coumadin dose was
titrated with goal INR between 2 and 3.

5. Hypothyroidism:  Stable.  Continued home levothyroxine.

6. Hypercholesterolemia:  Stable.  Continued home zocor.

7. Vitamin B12 Deficiency: Stable.  Continued home
supplementation.

8. Code Status:  A family meeting was held with [**Doctor First Name **], the
patient's daughter, and the legal [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) 96423**], along
with the medical and the palliative care team. The recent
decline of the patient along with her multiple medical problems
with anticipation of worsening prognosis over time was
discussed. A plan to alter diuretic doses in case of wt gain or
breathing difficulties was discussed in order to prevent
re-hospitalization. The poor prognosis of Mr [**Name13 (STitle) 19862**] in a code
setting was discussed. Given this information the family felt
strongly that the patient remain full code.
