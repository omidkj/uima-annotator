PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:   On presentation, the patient had a
temperature of 96.3, pulse of 41, blood pressure 142/66,
respiratory rate 32, oxygen saturation 92% on 2 liters.
General examination:  The patient was an ill-appearing,
elderly male, in no apparent distress.  Head, eyes, ears,
nose and throat examination:  The patient's pupils were
equally round and reactive to light.  Extraocular movements
intact.  Mucous membranes were pink and dry.  Neck
examination:  The patient had difficult to assess jugular
venous pressure. His neck was supple, without
lymphadenopathy.  Cardiac examination:  The patient was in
normal rate and rhythm, normal S1 and S2, and no murmurs,
rubs or gallops noted.  Pulmonary examination:  The patient
had bilateral rales up to one-half of the lung fields, with
increased dullness.  Abdominal examination:  The patient had
a midline scar, left lower quadrant tenderness.  The
patient's belly was soft, nondistended, with normal bowel
sounds.  There was no hepatosplenomegaly or mass palpated.
Guaiac was negative in the Emergency Department.  On
extremity examination, the patient had bilateral lower
extremity edema that was 2+, trace dorsalis pedis pulses
bilaterally.  On neurological examination, the patient was
alert and oriented x 3, with cranial nerves II through XII
intact.  Nonfocal examination.  Deep tendon reflexes were 2+
bilaterally, with downgoing toes.

LABORATORY DATA:   The patient had a white blood cell count
of 11.3, hematocrit of 24.4, and a platelet count of 183.
Differential revealed 62 neutrophils, 27 lymphs, 8 monos.
Chem 7 revealed a sodium of 141, potassium of 4.9, chloride
of 109, bicarbonate of 14, BUN 99, creatinine 5.3, and
glucose of 175.  The patient's initial CK was 198, with an MB
of 5 and a troponin of 1.1.  Chest x-ray revealed congestive
heart failure with right lower lobe atelectasis and small
bilateral pleural effusions.  A KUB revealed stool in the
colon.  An electrocardiogram was performed in the Emergency
Department, which revealed normal sinus rhythm with a rate of
90, with ST depressions that were new and 1 to 2 mm, with T
wave inversions in V5 to V6.  When the patient arrived on the
floor, a second electrocardiogram was done, which revealed
bigeminy with a rate of 80s, which went to normal sinus
rhythm with a rate of 70s, and [**Street Address(2) 4793**] depressions laterally.

HOSPITAL COURSE:   This 76-year-old man with multiple cardiac
risk factors, originally admitted for abdominal pain,
shortness of breath and diaphoresis, was found to have an
acute myocardial infarction.

1.  Cardiovascular.  This 76-year-old presented with an acute
myocardial infarction.  A cardiac catheterization was
performed on [**2166-6-19**], and revealed left main and three
vessel disease.  The patient was referred to Cardiothoracic
Surgery for coronary artery bypass graft.  On [**2166-6-20**],
the patient received a coronary artery bypass graft x 4 with
an saphenous vein graft to the left anterior descending,
saphenous vein graft to the obtuse marginal I, saphenous vein
graft to the obtuse marginal II, and saphenous vein graft to
the posterior descending artery.  The patient's
cardiovascular course postoperatively has been
hemodynamically stable.  The patient has continued on
Norvasc, Lopressor, Captopril and aspirin.  The patient has
ruled out for acute myocardial infarction postoperatively
three times in the setting of desaturations.

2.  Pulmonary.  The patient had been reintubated
postoperatively three times.  Initially the patient had a
left chest tube for pleural effusions.  A bronchoscopy was
performed on [**2166-6-24**], for mucous plugging, and the
patient required intubation after that.  The patient also had
left lower lobe infiltrates two days postoperatively.  The
Gram stain revealed gram-positive cocci and neutrophils.
This was treated with quinolones and clindamycin.  Culture
eventually grew oral flora.  The patient was transferred to
the Medical Intensive Care Unit on [**2166-8-5**], for copious
secretions and failure to wean off the ventilator.  The
patient had been off the ventilator since [**2166-8-4**], with
progressively decreased secretions.  The patient required
frequent suctioning on the floor.  He had been saturating
100% on 40% trach mask since [**2166-8-4**].

3.  Infectious Disease.  The [**Hospital 228**] hospital course was
complicated by pneumonia, as mentioned above.  Bronchial
washings eventually grew out acid-fast bacteria and oral
flora.  Infectious Disease was consulted and evaluated the
patient, placing him on respiratory precautions with repeat
acid fast bacilli smears.  Infectious Disease felt that this
was unlikely to be tuberculosis, as chest x-rays were not
consistent with primary or reactivation tuberculosis.  PPD
was placed on [**2166-8-2**], and the result was not reported.  The
patient also had a urinary tract infection that grew yeast on
[**7-22**] and [**7-24**].  The patient was treated with three days
of Fluconazole.  On [**8-7**], the patient was found to have
putrid urine, and cultures were sent, revealing greater than
100,000 colonies of enterococcus.  Infectious Disease was
consulted, and recommended switching the patient from a ten
day course of vancomycin to linezolid 600 mg twice a day.

On [**8-16**], the patient was found to have a large increase
in his white blood cell count, and a repeat chest x-ray was
obtained.  This revealed worsening consolidation at the left
base.  This was suspicious for a left lower lobe pneumonia,
and the patient was started on ceftriaxone 1 gram every 24
hours.

The patient was discovered to have hepatitis serologies that
revealed exposure to hepatitis B, as he had the HBCAB found.
The patient was positive for HAVAB for hepatitis A.

Final culture on the patient's urinary tract infection
revealed vancomycin-resistant enterococcus.

4.  Gastrointestinal.  The patient had a history of
constipation, and an abdominal CT on [**7-3**] revealed no
diverticulitis, abscess or obstruction.  It did note a
distended gallbladder, but no thickening.  A left adrenal
mass was noted.  Right upper quadrant ultrasound revealed a
common bile duct of 9 mm, with no stone or cholecystitis.
HIDA scan was performed, and was read as negative.

The patient presented with increased transaminases with
question of induced hepatic injury.  There was also
