Hypotension

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 16764**] is an 83F who presents to the [**Hospital1 882**] ED after
being found to be hypotensive (80/palp) at the [**Hospital1 10151**] Center. A femoral triple lumen central line was
placed and the patient received fluid resuscitation and levophed
to maintain her CVP and MAP goals. A CT abdomen and pelvis
showed right sided nephrolithiasis with hyronephrosis/ureter
with ?superimposed infectious process. CXR showed a RUL PNA. She
was given a dose of ceftriaxone, zosyn, and flagyl for ?
pneumonia and pyelonephritis. CK was elevated to 1076, and BNP
was elevatd to 1593
.
In the ED vital signs were BP= 100/76, HR= 130 in atrial
fibrillation, 95% on a 100% face mask with ABG 7.24/44/173 at
OSH. Her EKG showed diffuse T wave inversions, she had a
leukocytosis to 24.9, a CXR reportedly showed a RUL infiltrate,
UA was positive.

CXR [**4-16**]
PORTABLE CHEST RADIOGRAPH: Left-sided pacer seen with leads
projecting over the right atrium and ventricle. Nasogastric tube
is seen projecting over the stomach, tip incompletely imaged on
the study. There is a new focal opacity in the right upper lobe.
Increased opacity also seen in left perihilar region. Cardiac
silhouette again appears slightly enlarged. Increased
interstitial opacities and [**Last Name (un) 16765**] lines suggest mild pulmonary
edema. No
large pleural effusions are identified.

IMPRESSION: New focal consolidation in the right upper lobe
concerning for
pneumonia. Interstitial edema. Left upper lobe opacity could
represent
asymmetric edema or multifocal infection.
.
CT ABD/PELVIS [**4-16**]
Bilateral pleural effusions and adjacent passive atelectasis is
seen. Patchy areas of airspace opacity are also identified at
the lung bases. This suggests the possibility of aspiration.
Differential considerations also include infection. Clinical
correlation is recommended.

The adrenal glands, spleen, pancreas, and liver are grossly
unremarkable.
Several gallstones are seen. There is a punctate calcification
within the
right lobe of the liver suggesting prior granulomatous
infection.

Several left-sided renal stones are again seen, with obstruction
of the upper pole collecting system. The stones are slightly
more prominent than on the prior study. Several right-sided
renal calculi are seen. There are several small right ureteral
calculi distally measuring up to approximately 3 mm in short
axis dimension. There is moderate prominence of the right renal
collecting system and ureter.

The lack of intravenous contrast precludes the evaluation of
pyelonephritis. No gross evidence of a renal abscess identified.


There is suggestion of diffuse mild thickening of the colon.
This is a
nonspecific finding. Likely differential considerations include
infectious
etiologies. Clinical correlation is recommended. Small fluid is
identified
within the dependent aspect of the pelvis. The pelvic structures
are
otherwise grossly unremarkable.

No suspicious lytic or blastic bony lesions are identified.

IMPRESSION:
1. Bilateral renal calculi. Obstruction of the upper pole
collecting system on the left and moderate hydronephrosis on the
right. Right ureteral stones are seen.
2. Bilateral pleural effusions and patchy airspace opacities
noted at the
lung bases. Differential considerations do include infectious
etiologies and aspiration.
3. Cholelithiasis.
4. Suggestion of diffuse colonic thickening.


Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 16764**] is an 83F presenting with likely septic shock.  Her
hospital course is summarized by problem below. [**Name2 (NI) **] was
DNR/DNI and then made CMO due to ongoing respiratory distress.
Her [**Name2 (NI) 802**] was her HCP.
.
#. Hypotension: Patient treated initially with pressors. In the
setting of leukocytosis, a positive UA, and bilateral upper lobe
infiltrates likely septic shock. Possible sources included
UTI/pyelonephritis and pneumonia. The patient was treated with
ceftriaxone, Flagyl, Zosyn, and vancomycin in the ED. A femoral
line was placed for fluid resuscitation and IVF boluses for MAP
>60. Patient was treated with neo synephrine given her A.fib.
