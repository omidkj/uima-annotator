History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **] y/o F with recent complicated PMH including HTN, long
admission to [**Hospital1 2025**] and rehab for CVA (although not seen on
imaging) who presents today with acute worsening of SOB at home.
Per her daughter, she feels SOB every night but it usually
resolves on it's own. Last night, it just got worse and so she
came to the hospital.

In the ED, initial vital signs were 97.5, 66, 186/82, 24, 99% on
nasal canula. A room air sat was in the low 80s. Patient was
given vanco 1 gm, unasyn 3 gm, and clinda 600 mg. She was
started on a nitro gtt for hypertension. She was placed on bipap
and felt more comfortable. She also received zofran for nausea.
She receieved kayexcelate 30 mg PO x1 as well for K of 6.1.

On the floor, she in on the bipap mask at 50% FiO2 at 12/5,
tolerating it well. She is hypertensive with a SBP in the 160s.
She does not feel well and complains of feeling like she is not
getting enough air. She denies pain anywhere, specifically no
pain in her chest. She denies hx of nausea, vomiting, headache,
dizziness, fevers, chills, or cough at homee.

EKG [**2122-2-28**]:
Sinus rhythm with atrial premature beats. Prolonged P-R
interval. Poor R wave progression. Consider prior anteroseptal
myocardial infarction versus normal variant. Compared to the
previous tracing of [**2121-5-19**] the findings aresimilar.

CHEST X-RAYS:

[**2-28**]:
1. Congestive heart failure.
2. Bibasilar effusions/atelectasis and consolidations.

[**3-1**]:
As compared to the previous radiograph, the extent of the
pre-existing right pleural effusion has decreased. A small
pleural effusion on the left is still present. Unchanged massive
cardiomegaly, unchanged signs of overhydration. Given that
additional pneumonia cannot be excluded because of the existing
areas of atelectasis, short-term followup after dehydration is
recommended.

[**3-3**]:
Increasing moderate bilateral pleural effusion, right greater
than left and persistent severe cardiomegaly point to cardiac
decompensation and/or volume overload. Coexistent pneumonia
would be obscured.

[**3-5**]:
In comparison with the study of [**3-4**], there has been substantial
change in the degree of obliquity of the patient. Central line
remains in place. Extensive bilateral pleural effusions persist,
apparently worse on the right with underlying areas of
compressive atelectasis. No evidence of acute focal pneumonia.

ECHO [**3-2**]:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. There
is no ventricular septal defect. The right ventricular cavity is
mildly dilated with normal free wall contractility. The aortic
valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is mild aortic
valve stenosis (valve area 1.2-1.9cm2). No aortic regurgitation
is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild to
moderate ([**12-13**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The left
ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation. The
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate to
severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is severe
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
effusion.


Brief Hospital Course:
[**Age over 90 **]F with PMH of HTN, hyperlipidemia, recent possible CVA, and
chronic kidney disease presents with worsening SOB starting last
night and continuing until morning. CXR with evidence of
pneumonia and effusion. Also with worsening renal failure and
hyperkalemia.

# Hypoxic Respiratory Distress: new worsening hypoxic
respiratory failure with recent history of nighttime SOB that
seems to be chronic. PNA vs Orthopnea [**1-13**] worsening CHF, but
with CXR concerning for RLL pneumonia. No significant
leukocytosis, no fever or chills. No h/o CAD or CHF. Treated for
HAP with vanc and cefepime, with cipro added later for double
gram negative coverage.  Patient's Oxygen saturations improved
but her Oxygen requirement never reached 0.
