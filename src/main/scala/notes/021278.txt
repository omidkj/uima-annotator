Brief Hospital Course:
This is a [**Age over 90 **] yo woman who presented with melena and an 11 point
Hct drop, anticoagulated with INR = 11.2 on admission.  Hospital
course outlined by problem below:

# Melena- Likely GI Bleed in setting of INR of 11.2.  GI
consulted and evaluated patient.  She recieved 3 units pRBCs
with Hct 34.7 from 14.4 in ED.  Coagulopathy reversed with 2
units FFP and Vit K.  She was admitted to the ICU for close
monitoring.  Two large bore peripheral IVs were maintained for
access.  She was given a IV PPI.  Serial Hcts were followed and
remained stable.  All anti-coagulation was held - including ASA
and coumadin.  Anti-hypertensives were also held given unstable
blood volume.  Twice daily Hct should be checked tomorrow, as
well as daily Hct for the following 2 days to ensure stablility.
.
# CAD- EKG in ED showed diffuse ST depressions.  This resolved
with improvement in her Hct.
.
# Hypernatremia - This was likely due to volume depletion.
Lasix was held.  She received free water intravenously with
improvement in her Na.  A repeat Na should be checked tomorrow,
and periodically.
.
# AFib on Coumadin- She was continued on digoxin 0.125 mg every
other day for rate controll; coumadin was held.  She should not
resume coumadin therapy without discussion with her family re
risks and benefits.
.
# HTN - At baseline treated with Imdur, Lasix, Coreg and
Hydralazine.  These were held pending stabilization of her Hct.

.
# ARF on CRI: Her renal function improved with IV hydration.
Her lasix should be held for now; renal function should be
reassessed in [**1-9**] days.
.
# Diet: She was given IV fluid hydration.  She was made NPO
pending stabilization of her Hct.  She may resume her diet per

Discharge Instructions:
You were hospitalized for blood in your stool; we found that the
level of coumadin in your blood was too high, which caused you
to bleed. We reversed this level and your bleeding stopped on
its own. we transfused you with blood products to keep you blood
counts high.  You were also given free water for dehydration.
.
We think it is most useful for you to not restart the coumadin,
as it give you a risk of bleeding again. Please also do not take
your aspirin until instructed to do so by your doctor.
.
We are also holding most of your antihypertensives for now since
you had some low blood pressures while here. Your primary doctor
will tell you when to resume these.
.
Please take all medicines as prescribed and keep all your
followup appointments. If you experience any furhter blood in
your stools, or if you are lightheaded or dizzy, please notify
your doctor or go to the ED.
