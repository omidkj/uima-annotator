Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1171**]
Chief Complaint:
SOB, LE edema, decreased urine ouput

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac catheterization

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 57523**] is a 63 y.o. Male w/ DM, ESRD on PD, CABG (15yrs
ago), A. fib on Coumadin, CLL who initially presented to [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 8125**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]
w/ 2 weeks of progressive shortness of breath and LE edema.
.
Pt states that 2 days ago he had some lapses in his diet and
consumed very salty soup in the 2 days prior to admission. The
evening prior to admission, he noted some SOB as well as lower
extremity edema and decided to come to the ED. Although this
represents an acute issue he does notice over the past 2 weeks a
mild progression of DOE and lower extremity edema. He has also
noted a decrease in his urinary output, he usually urinates
700cc a day approximately, however over the past 2 weeks he has
been putting out 250cc. He denies any changes in his PD regimen,
he usually runs PD over 7 hours, output ranges 1600-2000cc.
After feeling SOB he went to [**Hospital1 **] ED.
.
In [**Hospital1 **] ED his initial VS were noted to be HR 97, BP 140/77,
Sat 88% on RA. His labs there were notable for a Cr 12.1, BUN
104, INR 6.8. Per the pt they attempted to used the PD catheter
but werent able to access it. He was then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].

.
In the ED here, initial vitals were T98.4, HR 84, BP 155/100,
Sat 4% on 4l. His labwork was notable for a BNP of [**Numeric Identifier **],
troponin of 0.49, CK-MB of 19, CK-MBI of 9.3. His BUn/Cr were
also markedly elevated at 106 and 12.1. He was also noted to
have an anion gap of 19. CBC showed a mild leukocytosis of 11.8,
that was neutrophillic (86.3%). An EKG showed atrial
fibrillation with no acute ST changes. CXR showed fluid overload
state. In the ED they were able to infuse 2L using the PD
catheter and removed 2.5L for a net -500cc.  On the floor, he
developed worsening dyspnea and was placed on a non-rebreather
mask with O2 saturations in the high 90s.  ABG revealed a gas of
7.28, 50, 99 on non-rebreather.  He received an 80 mg dose of IV
lasix followed by a 120 mg dose of IV lasix with no significant
improvement.  He received a single SL nitro and was then started
on a nitro drip with subjective improvement in his dyspnea.
Given his acute worsening of dyspnea, he was transferred to the
MICU.
.
Upon arrival in the MICU, he continued to saturate well on
non-rebreather and felt subjectively improved with nitro drip.
He received a repeat CXR which showed bilateral pulmonary
infiltrates that radiology felt was consistent with ARDS.
Received 2 mg IV morphine and was seen by renal consultation
service who are planning on ultrafiltration through peritoneal
dialysis with higher osmotic draw.

CARDIAC CATH
1. Selective coronary angiorgraphy in this right dominant system

demonstrated native three vessel coronary artery disease.  The
LMCA had
moderate diffuse disease.  The LAD and LCX were totally occluded

proximally.  The RCA was totally occluded in the mid-vessel.
There were
both right to right and left to right collaterals (from the
LIMA-LAD)
supplying the RCA.
2. Conduit angiography revealed the SVG to PDA to be stump
occluded.
The SVG to OMB was patent.  The LIMA was patent to the LAD.
3. Limited resting hemodynamics revealed moderate systemic
arterial
systolic hypertension SBP 164 mmHg.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Native three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Patent LIMA to LAD.
3. Patent SVG to OM LCx.
4. RCA is supplied by the native vessel with right to right
collaterals
and via left to right collaterals from the LIMA.

ECHOCARDIOGRAM
The left atrium is moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric
left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. Due to
suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality
cannot be fully excluded. The basal inferolateral wall appears
to be relatively thin and hypokinetic. The remaining segments
are grossly normal (LVEF ?50%). Right ventricular chamber size
and free wall motion are normal. The aortic root is mildly
dilated at the sinus level. The ascending aorta is mildly
dilated. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. No aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary artery systolic
pressure could not be determined. There is no pericardial
effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2148-11-9**],
the findings are similar (technical quality was superior for the
prior study).

CHEST X RAY
IMPRESSION: No acute intrathoracic abnormality or significant
change from
prior.


Brief Hospital Course:
63 y.o. Male with ESRD on PD [**2-18**] diabetic nephropathy, CAD s/p
distant CABG, DM II presenting with hypervolemia in the setting
of high sodium intake, with worsening lower extremity edema,
worsening short of breath, and reduced urine output.

##. Dyspnea/Volume Overload: Patient presented in acute
respiratory distress and required a MICU transfer requiring
non-invasive ventilation. Respiratory distress appeared [**2-18**]
fluid overlead. Initial diuresis plan included Lasix 200mg IV,
IV morphine, and nitro gtt. Given poor response of UOP to lasix,
Renal was consulted to increase PD cycles with concentrated
dialysate. Additionally, Lasix 80mg IV was given [**Hospital1 **].
Approximately 3L were taken off the patient. With diuresis,
patient's respiratory status improved. It was unclear whether
worsening renal function or cardiac decompensation caused
respiratory distress. Cardiac enzymes trended upwards, and a
cardiology c/s was called with cardiac cath. Resp status became
stable and the pt was able to be transferred to cardiology (see
below for more details about cardiac cath and cardiac work up).
LOS fluid balance is -4L.
