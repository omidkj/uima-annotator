History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 31 yo woman with h/o asthma, recent dx MS, [**Doctor First Name 919**]
syndrome, [**Last Name (un) 52372**] [**Doctor Last Name **] syndrome who presented to ED with CC of
cough/wheezing.  Pt states she was in her USOH until
approximately 5 days ago when developed increased wheezing, and
felt as though her asthma was flaring up.  She had run out of
her outpt advair at this time, and the pharmacy could not get it
for awhile, so she was not taking it over the past 5 days.  Over
the next couple of days, she continued to have SOB/wheezing, due
to her asthma, and then over the past 1-2 days developed
non-productive cough, mild rhinorrhea, chills, did not take temp
at home.  Also on night PTA, had onset of hives on her face and
tongue swelling, which she describes as similar to previous
allergic rxns to foods, but denies eating any new foods or foods
that she knows she has an allergy to.  Did eat from take-out on
friday night, but these sxs occurred saturday night.  Pt
otherwise denied any CP/pressure, heart palpitations, N/V, sore
throat, body aches.  States that her children and husband were
just sick with a viral URI.
To self treat her wheezing, cough at home, she states she has
been taking increased amounts of her home albuterol inhaler and
nebulizer treatment over past couple days to treat asthma and
compensate for no advair.  Notabley did albuterol neb treatment
on friday night, saturday night, and sunday morning prior to
presentation to ED.
In ED, initially felt asthma exacerbation and was given
prednisone 60mg PO x 1, levofloxacin 250mg x 1, along with
albuterol + atrovent nebulizer treatments.  CXR negative for
pneumonia.  Upon re-evaluation, pt was noted to be tachycardic
to 120's-130's, T 102, other VSS.  Labs notable for HCO3 19, AG
16, lactate 3.5.  EKG with diffusely flipped t waves, so concern
for pericarditis.  However, bedside U/S demonstrated no evidence
of pericardial effusion and pt CP free.  D dimer checked and was
nl.  Noted to be tremulous and have hyperreflexia on exam, so
concern for thyroid storm.  TSH sent, pending upon transfer to
MICU.  Endocrinology contact[**Name (NI) **] and aware of pt.  Pt given PTU
150mg x 1, hydroxyzine 25mg x 1, esmolol gtt.
Currently pt w/ continued cough, wheezing, but feels "ok".


Past Medical History:
- [**Doctor First Name 919**] syndrome: DS is a miswiring of the eye muscles that
causes some eye muscles to contract when they should not and
other eye muscles not to contract when they should. Often, when
the eye moves toward the nose, the eyeball also pulls into the
socket (ie, retraction), the eye opening narrows.
- [**Last Name (un) 52372**] [**Doctor Last Name **] syndrome: This autosomal dominant condition can
be
quite variable within families. The characteristics include lack
of an opening for the anus which must be repaired at birth,
abnormal bones of the hands or feet, kidney problems (usually
small, poorly formed kidneys), "lop" shaped ears, and mild
sensorineural hearing loss.  Single gene disorder (SALLI gene
mutation) encompasses many feature of both VATER association and
the [**Last Name (un) 52373**]-auriculo-vertebral malformation sequences.
- migraines : intense constant pain in back of her head which
wraps around in a band to the front, a/w nausea and occasionally
vomiting, photo- and phonophobia.  Last one 1 yr ago.  Has been
having daily [**2140-4-25**] severity either bifrontal or occipital
headaches with some associated left neck muscle aches in the
past
few days and on and off this summer.  Takes Tylenol PRN.
Headaches no not wake her from sleep.
- asthma
- anxiety

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2138-3-4**] 7:18 AM
SINGLE VIEW, CHEST: There are no focal areas of consolidation,
pneumothorax, pleural effusion, or infiltration. Pulmonary
vasculature is within normal limits without evidence of
interstitial edema. Hilar contours are normal without evidence
of hilar adenopathy. The cardiomediastinal contour is unusual
despite absence of gastric distension as present on previous
study. Similar unusual configuration of the cardiomediastinal
contour was also noted on [**2137-8-21**] and has since been
unchanged. There is no evidence of cardiomegaly.

IMPRESSION: Unusual cardiac contour unchanged since [**2137-8-21**].
No pneumonia or acute cardiopulmonary process.

Echo [**3-3**]
The left atrium is normal in size. The estimated right atrial
pressure is 10-20mmHg. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity
size, and systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%). Due to
suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality
cannot be fully excluded. Right ventricular chamber size and
free wall motion are normal. The aortic root is mildly dilated
at the sinus level. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The
aortic valve leaflets appear structurally normal with good
leaflet excursion. No aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial
mitral regurgitation. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure
could not be determined. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Normal biventricular cavity sizes with preserved
global biventricular systolic function. Mildly dilated ascending
aorta.

CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS:
Based on [**2137**] AHA endocarditis prophylaxis recommendations, the
echo findings indicate prophylaxis is NOT recommended. Clinical
decisions regarding the need for prophylaxis should be based on
clinical and echocardiographic data.

CTA CHEST W&W/O C&RECONS, NON-CORONARY  [**2138-3-3**] 3:43 PM

IMPRESSIONS:

1. Lower lobe and lingular subsegmental atelectasis, without
evidence of pulmonary embolus.

2. Incidentally noted duplicated superior vena cava.


Brief Hospital Course:
Assessment/Plan:  Pt is a 31 yo woman w/ h/o asthma, recently dx
MS who p/w asthma exacerbation, fevers, tachycardia w/ initial
concern for thyroid storm, but TFTs nl.
.
# Hypoxia/resp status:  Pt presented w/ c/o "asthma
exacerbation" w/ noted wheezing on initial exam.  Evaluated w/
CXR which was unremarkable.  However, after o/n treatment w/
nebulizer treatments and steroids, pt with increased vs
decreased O2 requirement.  CTA chest was done to r/o PE (even
though d dimer < 500), neg for PE or parenchymal consolidation.
DFA done on [**3-3**]
