Allergies:
Plavix / Heparin Agents

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2485**]
Chief Complaint:
CC: Hypotension, fever, tachypnea.


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Paracentesis, G-J tube placement with flouroscopy.

History of Present Illness:
HPI: 69 y/o female with a h/o pansensitive TB on 3 drug regimen,
MDS with pancytopenia, respiratory failure s/p trach placement
and revision [**5-/2147**], recently discharged [**2147-6-30**] with sepsis
presumed [**12-23**] PNA (by MDR E coli, pseudomonas) who comes in from
[**Hospital3 **] with tachycardia, tachypnea, and hypotension.
Two days ago the patient's G-tube fell out and she had it
replaced yesterday. She also had a new PICC tube placed
yesterday for additional access as her one PICC line was deemed
inadequate. The patient had known intermittent fevers with a
negative workup for anything other than her TB ever since she
was first diagnosed with TB in [**2146-11-21**], however yesterday
she was noted to have increased fevers. In addition, she was
also noted to have a decreased hct and was transfused 2PRBC
overnight. This morning she was then noted have tachycardia,
tachypnea, and hypotension with BP as low as the 60s systolic.
She received vanco/cefepime and flagyl and a 500cc NS bolus. She
then was transported to the [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.
.
In the ED: Initial VS 100.0 T, HR 130, BP 40/21, RR 22, O2 Sat
87%. Old left PICC pulled.  2L NS given.  Levophed started and
MAPs maintained >55.  She remained on AC, no increased support
requirements.  CXR with new LLL consolidation.  Labs: Lactate
3.1, CBC 20.1, INR 1.7, Plt 20.  She also was noted to have K
5.3 and Cr 3.2 (up from baseline 1.2-1.7).  Peaked T waves noted
on EKG: given calcium, HCO3, insulin, and dextrose as well as
Kayexylate.  Also administered 2U of FFP. CT abd was obtained
which showed no sign of abdominal abscess and normal positioning
of the G-tube. ID was curbsided and advised to give Meropenem
iv, Tobramycin IH, Cipro iv, and Dapto iv was started. On
transfer to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], VS 100.2 t, HR 105, BP 92/50, RR 36, 99%.


Past Medical History:
Recent ID course summarized as:
Prior cultures significant for MDR pseudomonas sensitive to
Cipro from sputum [**6-10**] and MDR E coli sensitive (ESBL) to
Meropenem from sputum [**6-9**]. Also, VRE from cath tip on [**6-21**],
started on Daptomycin, however, daptomycin was discontinued due
to negative blood cx for VRE on [**6-23**].  Tobramycin was added on
[**6-19**] for double coverage of resistent pseudomonas given poor
lung penetration of Cipro.  The full course of meropenem was
completed on [**7-2**] and of tobramycin on [**7-3**].
.
Past Medical History:
x [**Date range (1) 102693**] admission for presumed PNA sepsis.  ID course as
above
x Pulm TB (pan sensitive) with liver/spleen granulomas
- s/p R sided vats, r supraclavic LN, liver bx +
- h/o +PPD w/o tx
- AFB on BAL [**2147-1-2**]
- tx continuous since 2/1 per prior dc summ
x Diabetes mellitus
x OSA - previously on BiPAP
x Cataract left eye
x CVA/TIA (positive MRI) - right frontal with L arm/hand
hemiparesis; etiology likely moderate degree stenosis of the ICA
in the cavernous region, stable on recent CTA, hx of watershed
infarcts during acute illness in the setting of acute disease
x Asthma
x Hypercholesterolemia
x Seizure- uncertain diagnosis - L arm involuntary movements
[**2144**], not on anti-seizure medications
x Chronic renal insufficiency due to recurrent exposures to
nephrotocxic medications/ contrast and hemodynamic instability
in the context of recurrent sepsis, Creat on last discharge 2.6.
x Likely anoxic brain injury: nonverbal, withdraws to pain, eyes
open; presumptively from recurrent hypotensive insults
x MDS: on bone marrow biopsy with borderline transformation to
AML
x hx of HIT

Pertinent Results:
Imaging Studies:
[**2147-7-23**].  CT abdomen/pelvis.
IMPRESSION:
1.  Limited study given lack of IV contrast and streak artifact.
Opacification
of the G-tube demonstrates normal positioning of the G-tube.  No
intra-
abdominal abscesses are identified although difficult to
evaluate given lack
of IV contrast.
2.  Enlarged bilateral inguinal lymph nodes and left flank
subcutaneous
nodules.
3.  Left lower lobe consolidation.
4.  Heterotopic new bone formation surrounding the left proximal
femur,
unchanged.
5.  Anasarca.
.
[**2147-7-23**].  Chest X-ray.
IMPRESSION:  Increased airspace density within the left lung
base, which may reflect pneumonia or aspiration.
.
[**2147-7-26**].  CT abdomen/pelvis.
IMPRESSION:
1.  Multiple ill-defined areas of low attenuation within an
enlarged spleen, suspicious for infarction.
2.  Interval progression of bilateral lower lobe consolidation,
with stable small pleural effusions.
3.  New simple appearing abdominal and pelvic ascites.
4.  Malposition of the gastrostomy tube in the subcutaneous
tissues.
5.  No significant interval change in abdominal and pelvic
lymphadenopathy, compatible with known diagnosis of disseminated
TB.
.
[**2147-8-7**].  Renal Ultrasound.
IMPRESSION:
Limited ultrasound of the kidneys shows no hydronephrosis or
perinephric
abscess.  Heterogeneous appearance of the kidneys could relate
to infection, though this is uncertain.
Enlarged spleen with infarcts.
Peritoneal ascites with some complexity in the left upper
quadrant adjacent to the spleen.  It is uncertain if this
represents hemorrhage or other debris and infection cannot be
excluded.
