HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 73 year-old
male with a history of coronary artery disease, congestive
heart failure, history of deep venous thrombosis and PEs who
presents with complaints of worsening shortness of breath.
The patient was recently admitted to [**Hospital1 190**] from [**12-18**] to the 4th for an asthma
exacerbation.  He was treated with Albuterol and Atrovent
nebulizers and placed on Flovent and started on a rapid
steroid taper.  The patient showed some mild to moderate
improvement in his shortness of breath.  He was noted at that
time to have a known vocal cord polyp, which was believed to
be stable on laryngoscopy down in the Emergency Department.
Since that time the patient was seen by Dr [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 217**] of pulmonary in clinic on [**2169-12-28**].  Pulmonary
function tests at that time revealed mild restrictive lung
disease and flow volume loop revealed extra thoracic
obstruction.

The patient was diagnosed with vocal cord polyps in [**2169-6-16**] by ENT and it was felt by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 217**] that this
was the etiology of the patient's worsening shortness of
breath.  Although the patient's symptoms seem to improve with
inhalers and steroids after discharge he noted a one week
worsening shortness of breath upon exertion, worsening
hoarseness and orthopnea.  Concurrently the patient's Lasix
dose was changed to 20 mg po q.d. to 40 mg po q.d. on account
that there was a question of whether the patient's congestive
heart failure was exacerbating.  The patient denies any
fever, productive cough, change in peripheral edema, pleurisy
or chest pain.  The patient denies any dysphagia with food or
liquids, no weight change or night sweats.  The patient had a
25 pack year smoking history, but has quit times several
years.  No prior history of chewing tobacco.  No hemoptysis.

The patient presented to the Emergency Department on [**1-6**]
with increase of inspiratory [**Last Name (un) 15883**].  Chest x-ray was found
to be negative.  The patient was satting over 98% on room
air.  Given the patient's previous history of pulmonary
emboli a CTA was performed, which showed no PEs.  The patient
was also seen by ENT in the Emergency Department secondary to
significant inspiratory and expiratory [**Last Name (un) 15883**] on
examination.  The patient was evaluated at that time with
laryngoscopy and it was noted that there was significant
edema and erythema of the false cords and folds bilaterally.
The left true vocal cord was not able to be visualized and
the right vocal cord was immobile.  The bilateral arytenoid
was mobile during phonation and inspiration, but without much
mobility at the glottic level.  Given the question of a
supraglottitis versus laryngeal mass CT of the neck was
performed simultaneously with the CT angiogram and showed
fullness and thickening of the vocal cords bilaterally with
narrowing of the airway.  There was no discreet mass or
abnormal lymphadenopathy noted at that time.  Given the
significant narrowing of the airway the patient was started
on Decadron and Ceftriaxone and transferred to the Intensive
Care Unit for monitoring of airway.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  No alcohol, 25 pack year smoking history,
quit 40 years ago.  Lives with wife.  [**Name (NI) **] history of chewing
tobacco.  The patient is a singer.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Noncontributory.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 98.2.  Heart rate 50.
Blood pressure 144/85.  Respiratory rate 26, 98% on 2 lites.
General, obese male moderately uncomfortable using accessory
muscles to breath.  HEENT mucous membranes are moist.
Oropharynx is clear.  Neck audible inspiratory and expiratory
[**Last Name (un) 15883**].  No visible abnormalities.  Chest diffusely
transmitted inspiratory and expiratory wheeze and [**Last Name (un) 15883**]
bilaterally, decreased breath sounds at the right base.
Cardiac irregularly irregular rhythm, normal S1 and S2.
Abdomen soft, obese, nontender, nondistended, positive bowel
sounds.  Extremities left greater then right, 1+ lower
extremity edema, tender to palpation in the bilateral calf.
No clubbing, cyanosis or edema.  Neurological alert and
oriented times three, moving all extremities, no focal
abnormalities.

LABORATORY:  White blood cell count 19.3, hematocrit 49.4,
platelets 227.  Diff 87% neutrophils, 10% lymphocytes.
Chemistry 136, 4.8, 94, 29, 35, 1.0 and glucose 221.  Digoxin
level .9, calcium 9.7, phos 3.8, mag 2.0, PT 16.9, PTT 25.8
and INR 1.9.  Chest x-ray showed no pneumonia or congestive
heart failure.  Neck and CTA showed no PE and fullness and
thickening of the bilateral vocal cords with narrowing of
airway as described above, no discreet mass or
lymphadenopathy.  Electrocardiogram showed atrial
fibrillation with frequent premature ventricular
contractions.  Significant bigeminy with normal axis, QRS
prolongation, old significance of S wave or R wave in lead
V1, old T wave inversion in lead 1.  This was compared with
electrocardiogram from [**2169-12-18**].

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was transferred to the MICU for
observation overnight while placed on humidfied air, 10 mg of
Decadron and Ceftriaxone.  The plan was in place so that the
patient's status decompensated.  He would be started on
Heliox and likely intubated.  If intubation were required
fiberoptic assistance would be likely needed.  The patient
was started on CPAP at night in order to prevent soft tissue
collapse and was placed on cool nebs throughout the day.
Repeat fiberoptic examination on [**1-7**] revealed mild
epiglottic edema, bilateral false vocal cord edema, limited
PVC motion and limited visualization of the left posterior
vocal cord.  Slightly improved laryngeal edema.  The follow
up plan was for endoscopy in the Operating Room for
performance of biopsy of the left laryngeal lesion.  For
preparation of the procedure the patient's Coumadin was held
and he was started on a heparin drip.  The patient was also
evaluated by cardiology and with echocardiogram to rule out
any valvular abnormalities or significant atrial thrombus
secondary to atrial fibrillation.

Repeat echocardiogram showed an EF less then 20% with severe
left ventricular dilatation.  The plan was for the patient to
continue Carvedilol at 6.25 mg b.i.d., Aldactone, Lasix and
Digoxin.  Of note the patient also had significant atrial
fibrillation with tachybrady events.  He was rate controlled
with beta blockade and Digoxin.  At times he dropped his rate
down into the 40s, but with over symptomatic or dropped his
blood pressure.  When evaluated by EP to assess his pacemaker
EP noted that the patient's pulse was only palpable every
other beat secondary ventricular bigeminy and that his pacer
was functioning perfectly well.  Ultimately on [**2170-1-10**] the
procedure was performed after the patient's INR was
satisfactory.  Biopsy of the left vocal cord lesion and right
vocal cord lesion were done by Dr. [**First Name (S
