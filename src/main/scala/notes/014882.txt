Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 69390**]
Chief Complaint:
transfer for cath and ASA desensitization

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
1. Cardiac catheterization with drug eluting stent to left
circumflex artery - Attending Physician: [**Name10 (NameIs) **] [**Name11 (NameIs) 33746**], MD

History of Present Illness:
57yo F PMHx morbid obesity, DM, HTN, HLD, asthma, history of ASA
allergy (induced cough, worsened asthma symptoms) who was
initially admitted to [**Hospital6 33**] [**12-3**] w L arm pain,
found to have Lcx lesion, now transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for cardiac
catheterization and ASA desensitization protocol.  Per patient
report, on day of admission to [**Hospital1 34**], she developed acute onset L
arm pain in the setting of doing her morning stretches,
described as "severe", exertional, without associated chest
pain, shortness of breath.  Given comorbidities, coronary CTA
was ordered to better risk-stratify based on her coronary
disease, which was reportedly abnormal (no report available at
this time).  This prompted cardiac catherization that
demonstrated 3VD w mild RCA and LAD disease, as well as critical
mid LCx lesion.  Patient was transferred for further
intervention.
.
At [**Hospital1 18**] patient underwent cardiac cath via L radial, underwent
placement of DES to mid-Cx without complication.  Given history
of reported ASA allergy (1 year ago [**Male First Name (un) **] worsening wheezing /
asthma symptoms in past after 3d aspirin, with symptom
improvement after ASA cessation), patient was transferred to CCU
for post-cath  for ASA desensitization protocol.
.
On arrival to the floor, patient was without complaint, denied
shortness of breath, chest pain, arm pain.  Denied dyspnea on
exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, palpitations,
syncope or presyncope.

C.CATH [**2153-12-7**]:
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Successful PCI of the LCx with DES.
3. Aspirin desensitization immediately on arrival to CCU, then
continue
aspirin daily indefinitely.
4. Plavix 75 mg daily.
5. Integrilin IV gtt x 18 hours.
6. After discharge, the patient to follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **],
[**Hospital **]
Medical Cardiology.

Brief Hospital Course:
57yo F PMHx morbid obesity, DM, HTN, HLD, asthma, history of ASA
allergy (induced cough, worsened asthma symptoms) transfered for
critical Lcx lesion, now s/p [**Hospital **] transferred to ICU for ASA
desensitization protocol.
.
ACTIVE DIAGNOSES:
.
# 3 Vessel Coronary Artery Disease s/p PCI with Stent: She was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for evaluation and treatment of critical
stenosis of her mid left circumflex coronary artery. On
catheterization she was found to have significant 3-vessel
disease (please see report for full details) and had placements
of DES to mid LCx lesion. She was treated with plavix,
carvedilol, pravastatin, and integrillin and underwent aspirin
desensitization as below. Her course was otherwise unremarkable
and she was discharged with follow-up appointments in cardiology
and with her PCP.
.
# Aspirin Allergy/Desensitization: This patient with significant
history of allergies and atopy had a reported history of
reactive airways secondary to aspirin in the past. Following
stent placement, treatment with aspirin became a priority and in
consultation with the allergy and immunology team, she underwent
a 6 hour desensitization protocol involving montelukast prior to
initiation and frequent, escalating doses of aspirin with serial
peak flow measurements and close monitoring on tele for
possibility of developing a severe reaction. She was quite
anxious during this testing but tolerated the protocol well
without complications. She was discharged on aspirin and with
instructions to seek urgent medical care if she developed
concerning symptoms.
.
CHRONIC DIAGNOSES:
.
# HTN: Stable. She was continued on her home HCTZ and diltiazem.
.
# Asthma / Chronic Cough: Stable. In addition to the protocol
medications, she was continued on her home advair, mucinex, and
zyrtec.
.
# Seasonal Allergies: Stable. She was continued on her home
nasarel.
.
# DM: Stable. She was continued on her standing NPH and regular
insulin sliding scale.
.
# Thrombocytosis: Stable with PLT counts in the high 300's to
mid 400's. Her hydrea was held overnight on the day of admission
and restarted on discharge.
.
# GERD: Stable. She was continued on her home ranitidine.
.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
.
#This patient would likely benefit from an outpatient ECHO to
assess her cardiac function in [**4-25**] weeks
.
#She underwent aspirin desensitization protocol while admitted
here. She was instructed to seek care from her PCP for minor
symptoms or a local ED if her symptoms are more concerning with
the possbility of transfer back to [**Hospital1 18**] if warranted.
