HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a [**Age over 90 **]-year-old female
with a history of multiple medical problems as listed below
including recurrent pancreatitis attributed to
microlithiasis, who was in her usual state of health until
today when she developed abdominal pain radiating to her back
and side, and had some nausea.  She was brought to the
emergency department where she was found to have laboratory
values consistent with pancreatitis.  In the emergency
department, the patient received Lopressor for initially
elevated SBP of 187, but subsequently became hypotensive.
She received 5 liters of normal saline resuscitation, but
remained hypotensive, and therefore, was started on dopamine
and transferred to the ICU for further management.  Upon
initial evaluation, the patient also was describing
substernal chest discomfort as a complaint in association
with her back pain.  CT of her torso was performed, which
ruled out dissection, but did show distended gallbladder with
common bile duct, increase in diameter as well.  CT scan also
showed some stranding of the colon.  It was thought that her
hypertension may have led to her low flow state and bowel
ischemia.  Surgery was consulted in the emergency department,
but the patient was not a surgical candidate.  She was given
prophylactic antibiotics because of the CT findings.

Mild Alzheimer's disease  for which she receives Aricept and
Seroquel for sleep.
Hyperthyroidism.
Hypertension.
Recurrent UTIs.
Symptomatic bradycardia necessitating DDD cardiac pacemaker
placement.
Colon cancer at the age of 78 status post surgical resection.
No radiation or chemotherapy was performed.
Previous right-sided stroke.
Hysterectomy.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Noncontributory.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  She lives with her daughter.  She does not
smoke or drink or abuse drugs.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  T-max 97.8, heart rate
70, blood pressure 106/27, respiratory rate 17, saturation 98
percent on room air.  Well-appearing female in no apparent
distress, lying flat in bed.  HEENT:  Oropharynx:  Dry mucous
membranes, otherwise clear.  Neck:  Supple.  No
lymphadenopathy.  No JVD.  Cardiac exam:  Regular rate, S1,
S2.  No murmurs, rubs or gallops.  Pulmonary:  Normal with
slight crackles heard at the bases.  Abdominal exam:  Mild
distention, tympanic to percussion in the epigastric and
right upper quadrant region.  No rebound or guarding.  No
hepatosplenomegaly or masses appreciated.  Extremity exam:
Unremarkable.  Neurologic exam:  Alert and oriented x3,
moving all extremities.  No focal abnormalities.

LABORATORY DATA FROM ADMISSION:  White blood cell count 8.4,
65 percent polys, 30 percent lymphocytes, 2.4 percent
monocytes, 2.4 percent eosinophils.  Hematocrit 37.1,
platelets 302 and MCV 93.  Chemistry profile notable for a
BUN of 39, creatinine of 1.2, ALT 18, AST 37, alkaline
phosphatase 85, total bilirubin 0.4, amylase 652, lipase
2,642, CK 63, troponin 0.06.  Urinalysis, positive for
leukocyte esterase and blood, negative nitrites, greater than
50 white blood cells, moderate bacteria noted, 0 to 2
epithelial.

IMPRESSION:  A [**Age over 90 **]-year-old female presenting with recurrent
pancreatitis and hypertension, question of bowel ischemia,
most likely secondary to low flow state.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was in the ICU after pressors
were discontinued.  She was transferred out to the floor on
[**2169-3-14**].  Upon transfer to the floor, the patient developed
acute congestive heart failure from flash pulmonary edema.
Her saturation dropped to 76 percent on room air with a blood
pressure 205/142 and a heart rate of 105.  Lungs exam were
notable for diffuse expiratory wheezes and chest x-ray showed
evidence of pulmonary edema.  The patient was given nitrates,
morphine, Ativan.  Her pressure dropped to 70/44, but
subsequently responded to BiPAP and Lasix, with a normalized
pressure, and saturations returned to 96 to 97 percent on
room air.  The patient was sent to the NICU for respiratory
monitoring and BiPAP.  The patient was then called out again
to the floor with standing dose of by mouth Lasix and a net
diuresis of approximately 2 liters.  She received a total of
two units of packed red blood cells for anemia.  Her
laboratory studies were notable for a rising troponin of 1.08
with normal CK.  EKG showed pseudonormalization of T waves in
the lateral precordial leads, otherwise it was stable from
prior studies.  It was thought that this patient may have
suffered from a non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction in the
setting of having flash pulmonary edema.  Repeat
echocardiogram was performed on the 14th, which showed an EF
of 30 percent, moderate regional LV systolic dysfunction
consistent with CAD, moderate MR, worse from prior study,
most likely in the setting of having decompensated congestive
heart failure.  The patient was maintained on Toprol XL and
aspirin after a net diuresis with IV Lasix.  She is
clinically stable without any evidence of chest discomfort or
cough.  Cardiac enzymes began to trend down upon the time of
discharge.  The patient was also initiated on statin therapy
in the setting of having had a non-ST-elevation myocardial
infarction.  Plavix was also restarted.

Hypertension:  The patient's blood pressure was normalized
upon the time of discharge.  She was maintained on
antihypertensive regimen.

Type 2 diabetes:  The patient was restarted on her glipizide.

Urinary tract infection:  Urine cultures were negative and
the patient was asymptomatic, and therefore, antibiotics were
held.

Anemia:  Unclear etiology.  The patient had iron studies that
were sent.  Guaiac studies were negative.  The patient did
have a stable hematocrit post transfusion, may have been
likely hemodilutional.  However, the patient does have a
history of cancer as well as coronary artery disease and
diabetes, all of which are chronic conditions, which could be
contributing to her chronic anemia.

Pancreatitis:  The patient is status post aggressive IV fluid
hydration, normalization of her LFTs and resolution of her
abdominal pain.

Code status:  The patient was DNR/DNI during this
hospitalization course.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:  Pancreatitis.

Non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction.
Congestive heart failure.
