Service:  NEUROSURGERY
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Ms. [**Known lastname 22705**] is an 89-year-old
seen on [**3-18**] with increased difficulty ambulating,
incontinence, headache, falls and left sided weakness.  She
was found to have right sided subdural hematoma on the [**3-20**] and she continued to have left facial and upper
of [**Month (only) 116**] from the rehabilitation and she was doing well.
Secondary to increased lethargy and mild headache, she was
noted to be holding her right arm in a flex position and was
noted to have soft voice and increasing lethargy.  The CT
scan in the Emergency Room showed increased volume of the
subdural hematoma on the left side with compression of the
lateral ventricles and subfalcial herniation with increased
signs at this time are blood pressure 188/93, saturations 97%
on room air and pulse was 80 and regular.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Coronary artery disease, status post coronary artery
bypass graft
2.  Congestive heart failure, ejection fraction of 30%
3.  Atrial fibrillation
4.  Hypertension
5.  Pacemaker

MEDICATIONS:
1.  Lisinopril 10
2.  Atorvastatin 10
3.  Levoxyl 15
4.  Lasix 20
5.  Glipizide 5
6.  Atenolol 75
7.  Zantac 150
8.  She has also been on Coumadin, the dose of which we are
not sure of.
9.  Insulin

EXAM:
VITAL SIGNS:  The pulse was irregular.
ABDOMEN:  Soft.
NECK:  Supple.  There are no bruits.
NEUROLOGIC:  She is alert and oriented to name and states she
is in [**Hospital6 1708**] and that it is [**2198-1-31**].
She is mildly anxious.  Repetition is intact.  Attention
directed.  Motor right downward drift.  Mild right facial.
Right triceps, deltoids, wrist extensors and flexors are 4 to
4+/5.  Full strength on all the other extremities.  Sensory
is intact.
CNS:  Pupils are post surgical bilaterally.  Extraocular
muscles are intact.  Trapezius 5 and 5.  The rest of the
cranial nerves are fine.  Gait - walks unassisted.

LAB TESTS:  White cells 6.8, platelets 272 and hematocrit of
37.  Her INR was 1.2, PT 13.4, PTT 23.6.  Sodium 138,
potassium 3.8, chloride 99, bicarbonate 28, urea 16,
creatinine 0.8 and blood sugar was 158.

IMAGING:  Her electrocardiogram demonstrated atrial
fibrillation and head CT showed acute hemorrhagic competence
in the prior subdural collection.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The plan was to admit her to Neurosurgery
Intensive Care Unit for blood pressure control and also
drainage of the right subdural hematoma and this was done by
bedside.  The left scalp was prepared, draped in a sterile
fashion and after some intravenous sedation, a drain was
placed and some blood was drained.  The drain was left in for
48 hours and then it was removed.  Repeat head scan shows a
reduction in the amount of subdural collection and reduction
in mass effect since placement of catheter.  Her hematocrit
at the time of discharge was 32.7 and white cells 6.4,
platelets 237.  Sodium is 139, potassium 3.9, chloride 102,
bicarbonate 26, urea 12, creatinine 0.6 and glucose 150.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  She is awake, alert, oriented.  She has
a very mild drift to her left upper extremity, but otherwise
the neurological exam is intact and she is oriented x2.  She
is stable neurologically at present and she is being screened
for rehabilitation. Physical therapy and occupational
therapy and they have suggested to continue.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Impaired mobility
2.  Impaired balance
 She has risk for falls
The rest of the details of the physical therapy evaluation
can be found in their discharge papers.
