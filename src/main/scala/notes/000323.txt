Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Ultram

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2160**]
Chief Complaint:
Hematuria, cough, abdominal pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
IVC filter placement


History of Present Illness:
85 F h/o stage 0 CLL, not requring tx previously, presents to ED
for persistent cough/abdominal pain, and hematuria.
.
Pt notes about 2 months of increasing fatigue, nightsweats,
decreased appetite, and increasing left side abdominal pain
(intermittent, no relation to food, BM, sharp, no diarrhea,
constipation, melena). She was seen by PCP [**2125-1-9**], felt to have
viral URI, symptoms persisted, and seen again [**2125-1-23**] with
persistent cough (intermittently productive, yellow-white),
single episode of hematuria (clear red, not clot), and LLQ
abdominal pain, treated with azithromycin, and abdominal US
obtained which revealed new splenomegaly with new 1.5-cm
echogenic area.

On [**1-31**], pt noted recurrent episode of "strong blood in urine."
Describes clear red +clots, +feeling incomplete voiding, no
suprapubic pain, no CVA tenderness. Also notes transient R LE
shooting pain last night which has resolved.

Pt presented to the ED with VS: 98.1 79 113/69 16 100%RA. In the
ED, CXR with LUL collapse, CT ABD/PELVIS with multiple new
metastasis, and new mass in bladder. Also RLL PE. UA +hematuria,
+ UTI. pt given levo, flagyl, morphine 2mg x3 for pain. BP then
noted to drop to 70/37, pt received total 2L IVF, although
timing unclear, with BP improved to 102/55s (?dehyration vs
sepsis vs morphine). No central line placed. CT head obtained in
anticipation of possible anticoagulation.


Past Medical History:
- CLL - referred to heme/onc (Dr [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]), for anemia,
leukocytosis, found on [**2123-6-3**] flow cytometry confirmed B-cell
chronic lymphocytic leukemia, stage 0, asymptomatic (no LAD,
thrombocytopenia, splenomegaly), so no plan for treatment as of
[**10-12**].
- htn
- asthma
- hyperlipidemia
- OA - left hip, knee, previously on vioxx.
- tah/bso [**1-6**] fibroids.
- glucose intolerance (not on meds, a1c 6.1->5.5)
- glaucoma
- cancer screening: colonoscopy on [**2123-5-26**] showed 2 adenomatous

polyps, one in the transverse colon and the other in the
descending colon. Annual mammographies have been negative.


Social History:
- deniess tobacco, denies alcohol, IVDU.
- she lives with her husband. They have 2 children, 1 son and 1
daughter, in their 50s and 60s, respectively.
- Worked as a pharmacist in [**Location (un) 3155**], [**Location (un) 3156**]. She was 80 miles from
the Chernobyl accident in [**2102**], leaving on the 3rd day of the
radiation exposure, although she's not certain if she was in
fact exposed to radiation. 3 months later, she returned to her
residence. Some of her co-workers had thyroid concerns after the
Chernobyl accident. She moved to the U.S. in [**2108**].

Family History:
No family history of hematologic or oncologic dyscrasias. Both
parents died of strokes. A sister, her only sibling, had
"pancreatic" obstruction, not cancer related, and died at age
64. The patient's daughter had breast cancer at age
54.

DIAGNOSIS

FLOW CYTOMETRY REPORT



FLOW CYTOMETRY IMMUNOPHENOTYPING

The following tests (antibodies) were performed:  HLA-DR, FMC-7,
Kappa, Lambda, and CD antigens: 3, 5, 10, 19, 20, 23, 38, 45.



RESULTS:

Three-color gating is performed (light scatter vs. CD45) to
optimize lymphocyte yield. Lymphocytes comprise <1% of total
analyzed events.

B-cells are scant in number precluding evaluation of clonality.
Approximately 77% of total analyzed events show dim CD45 and
high side scatter, representing neutrophils.



INTERPRETATION

Non-diagnostic study.  Clonality could not be assessed in this
case due to insufficient numbers of B-cells. Cell marker
analysis was attempted, but was non-diagnostic in this case due
to insufficient numbers of cells. If clinically indicated, we
recommend a repeat specimen (fresh) be submitted directly to the
flow cytometry laboratory.

 AP AND LATERAL CHEST [**2125-2-8**]:

COMPARISON: [**2125-2-5**].

INDICATION: Metastatic cancer.

Bilateral small to moderate pleural effusions are present, with
slight improvement on the left. Cardiomediastinal contours are
unchanged. Bibasilar areas of atelectasis adjacent to the
effusions are also without change.

IMPRESSION: Bilateral small to moderate pleural effusions with
slight improvement on the left.

REPORT TO: DR. [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **] [**Initial (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]

DIAGNOSIS: Urine:

  ATYPICAL.

  Atypical but very degenerated urothelial cells, cannot
  exclude urothelial dysplasia/neoplasia.
  A few squamous cells, histiocytes, scattered lymphocytes,
  and many red blood cells.

Urine cytology:
DIAGNOSIS:



A.  Cell block, "[**2125-2-2**]":

Blood and  rare atypical but markedly degenerated urothelial
cells and a few lymphoid cells, see note.



B. Cell block, "[**2125-2-3**]":

Blood and  rare atypical but markedly degenerated urothelial
cells and a few possible lymphoid cells, see note.



C.  Cell block, "[**2125-2-4**]":

Insufficient material for diagnosis.



Portable AP chest dated [**2125-2-5**] is compared to the chest CT from
[**2125-2-2**] and chest radiograph of [**2125-2-1**]. Patient respiratory
motion degrades the image. The heart is normal in size; however,
there is marked opacification of the left heart border and
retrocardiac region which may represent
atelectasis/consolidation and pleural effusion. The right lung
is grossly clear, but there is probably a small right pleural
effusion. There is no pneumothorax.

IMPRESSION:
1. Patient respiratory motion degrades the quality of the image.
2. Left lower lobe opacification likely represents
atelectasis/consolidation plus effusion.
