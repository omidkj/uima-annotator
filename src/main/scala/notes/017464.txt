Chief Complaint:
"I'm taking too many medicines and I fell"

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
62 y/o woman with history of CVA (right sided deficit), ETOH
dependence, sCHF LVEF 40% who presented with somnolence and
multiple falls from her wheelchair.
Per family she has been drinking alcohol and taking baclofen.
She falls asleep then subsequently falls from her wheelchair or
the cough. She hit her right upper extremity but not her head by
her report. On the morning of admission she fell out of her
wheelchair and was found on the floor. Last drink was 1 day PTA.
No tremor, headache or neck pain.

In the ED, initial vitals: 99.2 117 147/63 16 100% RA Exam
notable for baseline right-sided spasticity. No cervical spine
tenderness to palpation. Right upper extremity skin tears. Right
lower extremity pressure ulcer. Labs notable for Na 129 (at her
baseline). Tox screen negative. CT head: showed prior MCA
infarct, no acute process, CT C spine showed large posterior
osteophyte at C5-6 with moderate spinal canal narrowing. CXR
showed increased interstitial marking consistent with chronic
lung disease. EKG showed sinus tachycardia at 103 with TWI in
V1-V4. She received 1L NS without change in sinus tachycardia.
Upon arrival to the floor ECG showed sinus tachycardia with TWI
V1-V4. SBP persistently 180s with HR 120s. She reportedly did
not take her regular BP meds today. Nurse checked on patient
because an alarmed bed and found her to be somnolent and hypoxic
82% on RA. She was diaphoretic and tachypneic with RR 30-40,
sats improved to 92% on 30% ventimask. D-dimer was checked which
was positive ~[**2126**]. ECG then showed LBBB. CE negative.
Cardiology called who completed a bed side echocardiogram. She
received 325mg aspirin. CXR showed increased RLL opacity
suggestive of either aspiration versus atelectasis and increase
in pulmonary edema. ABG 7.44/34/61/24, lactate 2.1. Received
hydralazine and lasix.

Imaging:
R Hand Xray: IMPRESSION:  Limited exam, without evidence of
fractures.

R Arm Xray: IMPRESSION:  Limited exam, without evidence of
fractures.

CXR: IMPRESSION:  No definite acute cardiopulmonary process.
Increased
interstitial markings suggestive of underlying chronic lung
disease.

Head CT:
IMPRESSION:
No acute intracranial process.  There is a large region of left
frontal
encephalomalacia consistent with history of prior infarction,
with associated ex vacuo dilatation of the ventricles.

C-Spine CT:
IMPRESSION:  No fracture or malalignment of the cervical spine.
There is a large posterior osteophyte, at C5-6, which results in
moderate canal
narrowing.  If there is concern for cord injury, please note
that MRI is more sensitive for this.

TTE:
IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Moderate concentric LVH
with a small LV cavity size and moderately depressed global LV
function. The inferolateral wall appears more hypokinetic than
other segments.

Chest CT with Contrast - Prelim Read:
COPD with severe emphysema and diffuse bronchial wall
thickening, worst in RLL with probable aspiration.
Mild pulm edema + small effusions R>L.
Severe atherosclerosis.
No PE.


Brief Hospital Course:
ID: 62F with history of CVA with right-sided deficit, presenting
today somnolence and frequent falls, now with acute respiratory
failure.

# Acute respiratory failure:
Occurred suddenly a few hours after admission and promted MICU
transfer. Most likely combination of flash pulmonary edema +/-
aspiration event. EKG and cardiac enzymes not suggestive of
ischemia. CTA with no PE, questions of trace aspiration in RLL.
BP was very high and was tachycardic in setting of not taking
home BP meds (including high home dose of atenolol) that day.
Home ACE had also been stopped for unclear reasons. Improved
with 20mg IV lasix and IV labetalol. Bedside ECHO with no focal
wall motion abnormalities and baseline EF. Not given Abx as
breathing quickly improved and CTA with very minimal aspiration
and no obvious pneumonia. Breathing comfortably on RA at time of
callout to floor.

Pt was readmitted to the ICU on [**5-3**]-12am after a code blue for
pulselessness found to be PEA arrest. At approx 0830 [**5-3**], pt was
found to be very pale/yellow, with eyes open and fixed, blue
lips w/ mouth open with yellowish froth coming out of mouth onto
chin. She had no pulse and code blue was called and chest
compressions commenced. Unknown how long she had been pulseless
for. Pt was initially in PEA arrest and then s/p two pushes of
epi was in V-tach and received shock; reentered PEA arrest then
rec'd two more pushes of epi; then had wide-complex tachycardia
and received 2nd shock; reentered PEA and rec'd one more amp of
epi with ROSC and return of pulse. Pt was intubated; NGT placed
to remove gas and improve ventilation; IO
