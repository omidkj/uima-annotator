History of Present Illness:
History of Present Illness:  Mr. [**Known lastname 31**] is a 69 year old
pleasant gentleman with COPD, atrial fibrillation on Coumadin,
history of ischemic Right parietal stroke approximately 6 yrs
ago resulting in seizure disorder, long history of EtOH abuse,
and recent subdural hematoma resulting in a one-month long
hospitalization at [**Hospital1 18**] with discharge on [**2112-4-7**] who presents
in respiratory distress with appreciable Left sided pleural
effusion on CXR.
.
Mr. [**Known lastname 31**] was discharged from [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2112-4-7**] following a
one-month hospitalization for a subdural hematoma.  Following
discharge, the patient's son reports continuing mental status
changes, characterized mainly by increased somnolence, while the
patient reports chills for the past month and non-productive
cough as well.  Given his persistent mental status changes, his
son brought him for a neurologic evaluation to [**Hospital1 18**].  Following
the evaluation and head imaging, the patient developed sudden
chest pain and SOB in the [**Hospital1 18**] east lobby and was subsequently
taken to the ED.
.
In the ED, the patient's initial VS were: T: 99.6 HR: 113 BP:
110/65 RR: 16 O2Sat: 96% 4L NC.  The patient did not endorse any
chest pain or fevers, but continued to have SOB.  A chest x-ray
revealed a large left-sided pleural effusion, and the patient
was administered 1L of NS, IV Azithromycin and Ceftraixone, and
Tylenol.  Interventional Pulmonary was consulted to drain the
pleural fluid, and removed approximately 1.7L of pleural fluid
through placement of a pigtail catheter.  However, during the
procedure, the patient became hypotensive with SBPs in the 80s,
prompting his admission to the MICU.
.
On arrival to the MICU, the patient was in no acute distress,
but appeared somewhat somnolent in response to questioning.  His
VS were: T: 98.4 HR: 96 BP: 98/57 RR: 33 O2Sat: 96% 2L NC.

Past Medical History:
1) COPD
2) Atrial Fibrillation
3) Ischemic stroke - R parietal lobe (6 yrs ago per the patient)
4) Seizures - L hand rhythmic shaking, complex partial seizures
5) H/o EtOH abuse
6) Subdural hematoma

Lives with wife in [**Name (NI) 1474**]. Retired exterminator. States drinks
whiskey daily, but has been sober since [**Month (only) 404**]. Non-smoker.


Family History:

IMAGING/STUDIES:
================
CHEST (PA & LAT) [**2112-5-12**]:
IMPRESSION: Marked new opacification of the left mid to lower
hemithorax with a lenticular shape which may potentially imply a
large loculated pleural effusion in addition to parenchymal
opacification.
.
Portable TTE [**2112-5-13**]:
Pleural effusions are present. The left atrium is dilated. Left
ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular
cavity is unusually small. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is normal (LVEF 65%). There is considerable
beat-to-beat variability of the left ventricular ejection
fraction due to an irregular rhythm. The right ventricular
cavity is dilated with depressed free wall contractility. There
is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. The branch
pulmonary arteries are dilated. There is no pericardial
effusion.
.
CT CHEST W/O CONTRAST [**2112-5-13**]:
IMPRESSION: Extensive highly loculated and only partially
drained left
pleural effusion. Small right pleural effusion.
Extensive pulmonary emphysema with areas of non-characteristic
scarring and atelectasis.
Extensive coronary and aortic calcifications.
Calcified gallstones, calcified upper abdominal vessels.
.
UNILAT UP EXT VEINS US RIGHT [**2112-5-18**]:
IMPRESSION: No evidence of DVT in the right upper extremity.
.
Chest xrays, most recently:
CHEST (PORTABLE AP) [**2112-6-10**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. Dobbhoff feeding tube has its tip projecting over the
expected location of the stomach. Right subclavian PICC line has
its tip in the proximal SVC,
unchanged. Bilateral airspace opacities, left greater than right
with
probable associated layering effusions are again seen. Two
surgical clips are again identified at the left lung base. No
overt pulmonary edema. The lung apices are not entirely
included; therefore, evaluation for a pneumothorax is limited on
this examination. Calcification of the aortic knob and
descending aorta consistent with atherosclerosis. Overall,
cardiac and mediastinal contours are stab
