None


History of Present Illness:
Briefly, this is a 60 yoM with ESRD on peritoneal dialysis, DM2,
HTN, diastolic CHF, anemia, wheelchair-bound state who presented
from home with agitation and dyspnea after his wife was unable
to successfully complete his PD sessions at home. The catheter
had been flipped up into his abdomen and was not successfully
pulling back. He also became dyspneic at home - likely from
volume overload with inability to remove the dwelling fluid. The
catheter has since been fixed and he has had successful dialysis
while here. Importantly, the patient also had a recent admission
for C.diff diarrhea (+ by PCR) and is to complete a PO Vanc
course until [**2193-11-25**]. On initial presentation the patient was
extremely agitated, K was 6.9, lactate 0.8. CXR was performed
and pneumonia could not be excluded, thus patient was given 750
mg IV levofloxacin, also got doses of vanco and flagyl.
Kayexelate, insulin were given and K improved to 4.7 today.
.
Currently, the patient's VS are 99.8 80 138/67 18 99% on RA. He
is conversant and appropriate. He states that he feels well and
wants to go home. He denies SOB though his lungs have diffused
rhonchi and crackles. He abdomen is non-tender. He reports that
he was having [**1-5**] bowel movements at home. He currently has a
flexiseal in place.

[**11-20**] CXR:
Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged, slightly shifted
towards the left
side. Bibasilar consolidations have improved on the right side
due to
improvement of the component of atelectasis. Vascular congestion
has markedly
improved. There is pneumothorax or large pleural effusions.
Spinal hardware
is present.
.
AbXrays: initially showed peritoneal dialysis catheter flipped
into upper quadrant (wrong location) and then showed resolution
with catheter coiled in RLQ

Brief Hospital Course:
60 yo M with ESRD on peritoneal dialysis, presented from home
with altered mental status and dyspnea in setting of receiving
no peritoneal dialysis since recent discharge from [**Hospital1 18**] on
[**2193-11-14**]. In ED, was combative and refusing treatment, had
hyperkalemia on laboratory evaluation.
.
#. Altered Mental Status:
Patient with single day of confusion and agitation. AMS most
likely secondary to metabolic derangements (hyperkalemia) given
recent limitations in dialysis.  Pt was alert and oriented x 3
at the time of discharge. Blood cultures were negative at the
time of discharge. Restarted home mirtazapine and paroxetine at
home doses.
.
#. ESRD / Hyperkalemia:
Likely due to insufficient peritoneal dialysis in last 4 days
due to shift in location of dialysis catheter and in setting of
patient being discharged from hospital newly on lisinopril and
with instructions to take 20 mEq supplemental potassium daily.
(Patient was recently started on potassium supplements and
lisinopril because of chronically low K). The catheter shifted
back into proper location and multiple rounds of successful
peritoneal dialysis were performed. The patient was discharged
to have labs drawn the following week in case his potassium
again became low. Continued calcitriol and nephrocaps.
.
#. Dyspnea:
Likely due to volume overload from ineffective dialysis. He was
initially covered with antibiotics, however these were stopped
when the patient's dyspnea improved with successful dialysis. He
did have crackles on pulmonary exam at the time of discharge,
however, CXR was improved and he did not have fevers. He did
have URI symptoms but broad-spectrum antibiotics were not
continued as the patient was breathing comfortably on room air.

.
#. Diarrhea:
Presumably related to c diff colitis as evidenced by +PCR during
prior admission.
Continued oral Vancomycin for until [**2193-11-25**] as previously
planned. Restarted loperamide and Diphenoxylate-Atropine and
uptitrated medications to help slow the diarrhea. The patient
was to have GI follow-up the following week. He had no
tenderness on abdominal exam.
.
#. Troponin elevation:
Likely slightly elevated in setting of ineffective dialysis.
CK-MB values were flat. Continued aspirin and simvastatin.
.
#. Hypertension:
BP elevated to 170s systolic at presentation, no periods of
relative hypotension in [**Name (NI) **]. Continued home metoprolol and
nifedipine. Held lisinopril though this may need restarted as an
outpatient if potassium again becomes low.
.
#Anemia: Hct stable but low at 23; likely [**2-5**] renal disease.
Transfused 1 unit PRBCs with adequate response.
.
Access: The patient had a R femoral line during admission.
.
# DVT prophylaxis was with subQ heparin. The patient remained
full code during this admission. Communication was with [**Name (NI) 3408**]
