History of Present Illness:
83 y/o male w h/o CAD (90% stenosis of LAD with BMS deployed in
'[**87**]), HTN, & LE edema who presented with painless BRBPR starting
on the morning of admission. His BMs were initially streaked w/
blood which then became very loose and mostly bright red blood.
This happened multiple times throughout the day, and continued
at [**Hospital1 18**] ED totalling 5 bloody bowel movements in the ED, as
well as lot of blood in and around the toilet bowl. The pt
denied abdominal pain, N/V, rectal pain, pain w/ BM, CP/SOB,
lightheadedness/dizziness.
.
In the ED initial vital signs were 98.4, 88, 166/77, 20 @ 97% on
RA. H/H 12.5/34.6, BUN/Cr was 25/0.9; EKG: NSR, LAD, NI, NSST,
c/w previous. He got 1L NS, NO blood. Vital signs prior to
transfer: 96.5, HR 73, BP 147/61, RR 18, 100% on RA.
.
On the floor he was HD stable, and without complaints. At 745pm
patient walked to toilet had large bloody BM, he vagalled in the
setting of seeing the blood and lowered himself to the floor. He
was normotensive at the time, with transient hypotension to the
90s, which resolved. He has not been tachycardic. He continued
to have bloody bowel movements overnight, got 1unit of PRBCs,
getting another unit on transfer, and ordered for an additional
1 unit. Crossed for 4 more units. IR consulted and surgery to
eval. IR recommends CTA of abdomen. He has an 18 and 20gauge IV.

Brief Hospital Course:
In the MICU, the patient was thought to be having a lower GI
bleed from diverticulosis. He had 2 peripheral IVs (18s) and a
3rd (20g) was placed. He was given 4 more units of RBCs. IR,
surgery, and GI were all consulted, and the patient was sent for
a CTA abdomen, which did not show signs of extravasation. He
subsequently had a tagged RBC scan which showed bleeding at the
hepatic flexure. The patient was sent to the interventional
radiology suite for potential embolization of the bleeding
source; IR was unable to localize the source of bleeding.

Of note, prior to the Tagged RBC scan, Mr. [**Known lastname **] experienced
what appeared to be a vagal episode with a malfunction of the
EKG leads as he arose to use the bedpan -- it was treated at the
time as PEA arrest -- and the patient regained consciousness
spontaneously upon starting of chest compressions.

Stable after his trip to IR, he was taken back to the MICU but
experienced further episodes of BRBPR early into the morning.
He was becoming hypotensive and required further blood
transfusion.

In total, Mr. [**Known lastname **] required 7 units of blood in just over 24
hours and was continuing to bleed after unsuccessful attempt at
IR control.  He was urgently taken to the OR at this point by
the general surgery team for a right hemicolectomy.

Please refer to Dr.[**Name (NI) 88810**] operative summary for more details.
In short, the right colon was removed and a primary anastomosis
was made.  He was transferred to the Surgical ICU
post-operatively.

His post-operative course, by systems:

Neuro: Pt was started on a dilaudid PCA which he tolerated well.
During his SICU admission, there was concern for seizure
activity which was documented on subsequent EEG directed by
Neurology consultation. Anti-epileptics were initiated and
subsequently discontinued following multiple conversations with
the Neurology consultants and final determination that suspicion
for ongoing seizures was low. At the time of discharge, he was
receiving haldol for agitation and PO pain medications with good
results.

CV: Pt went into atrial fibrillation in the early post-operative
period.  He was started on an amiodarone drip for rate control.
This was weaned to off on POD 1 and he was transitioned to his
home dose of PO diltiazem which he tolerated well. Pt was
transiently on single vasopressor during this admission during
concern for septic shock which was subsequently successfully
weaned off with broadening of antibiotic regimen. He remained in
rate controlled Afib until discharge without pressor requirement
or hemodynamic instability. The patient was also started on
lisinopril. A TTE was performed and showed an EF of 50-55% with
moderate-severe TR and severe PA systolic HTN. Coumadin was
started on HD32 and dosed according to the INR.

R: Pt underwent endotracheal intubation for the OR without
incident. Post-operatively, he had difficulty weaning from
mechanical ventilation and was noted to have a LLL PNA via
surveillance CT torso for which he was treated (please see ID
section). On POD 23, pt underwent successful bedside
percutaneous tracheostomy for prolonged intubation and
subsequently tolerated weaning ventilation to trach collar.
On HD 30 a R pigtail drain was placed for increasing pleural
effusion and discontinued on HD 44.

GI: GI bleed issues preop, as described above.
Post-operatively, he was kept NPO with an NGT until he had a
return of bowel function. Concern for a wound infection was
noted along his midline abdominal incision which was partially
opened and subsequently dressed with a VAC. Fascia was noted to
be intact during each VAC dressing change. Wound cultures
demonstrated Enterobacter and E.coli which was treated (please
see ID section).  In addition, concern for a pelvic fluid
collection was pursued with IR drainage which ultimately was
culture and gram stain negative with drain subsequently removed.
 Concern for CDiff colitis which was empirically treated with PO
and IV antibiotics given concordant leukocytosis and watery
stool with all toxin assays negative. On HD33 a PEG was placed
and TF were started the following day and well tolerated.

GU: Urine output was adequate but borderline low on POD 0 into
POD 1.  He was additionally fluid resuscitated with crystalloid
and some albumin into POD 2 and subsequently had improved urine
output.  During his SICU admission, concern for uremia was
raised and CVVH electively initiated in consultation with Renal
Consult Service with excellent results.  Lasix drip and
subsequent CVVH were also utilized to titrate pt's fluid balance
and discontinued without complication. At no point was there a
significant concern for unrecoverable renal damage. The patient
was given intermittent lasix toward the
