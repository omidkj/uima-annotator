Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2736**]
Chief Complaint:
SOB, Pleural Effusions, PNA, pericardial effusion, concern for
tamponade

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
pericardial window, thoracentesis with chest tube

History of Present Illness:
Ms [**Known lastname 35028**] is a 50yoF with PMH significant for depression,
though negative for cardiac risk factors including CHF or CAD.
She was transferred to CCU on [**2154-10-21**] with concern for
pericardial tamponade.

She originally presented to [**Hospital3 **] with 2 weeks of
progressive productive cough, fever, SOB, and DOE despite 2
courses of PO abx (z-pack started [**10-3**]; levaquin started
[**10-16**])for outpatient treatment of PNA, and was found to have a
leukocytosis to 13.7, and a large pericardial effusion, B/L
pleural effusions and LLL opacity on CT scan.

Vitals in ED showed T101.8F, RR 20's-low 30's; winded with any
activity or with talking. Sats high 90's on 4l NC. Of note, she
has had a 50lb intentional weight loss over the last year with
strict diet modification. Prior to this episode, no F/C/NS. She
does also complain of some epigastric discomfort ([**2-21**], dull,
worse with cough). She mentions that she had a few short
episodes of palpitations on exertion in the last weeks prior to
her admission. She denies chest pain, lightheadedness or
dizziness. No sick contacts. Of note she took a cruise to the
Bahamas in late [**Month (only) **] for 1 week. Goes to Caribbean for 1
week every year, otherwise no TB exposure history.
.
ED course: WBC 13.7, chem7 normal. Cardiology was consulted and
bedside echo suggestive of pericardial effusion. Blood cultures
taken. Given PO Azithromycin and IV Ceftriaxone. Given Tylenol
1gm
.
When getting to the CCU, the patient is in NAD, though quite
anxious. Afebrile, hemodynamically stable, mildly tachypnic.
Pulsus paradoxus is 12mmHg.
.
On review of systems, she denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. She denies exertional buttock or calf
pain. All of the other review of systems were negative except
per above.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, syncope or
presyncope.

1. CARDIAC RISK FACTORS: negative for DM, HTN, HLD
2. CARDIAC HISTORY:  none
3. OTHER PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
- Depression / paranoia
- cellulitis in lower extremity x2 2-3 years ago
- breast biopsy several years ago (2 sisters with breast cancer
diagnosed at 35 and 40)

paramedic. No recent sick contacts. Travels to Caribbean for 1
week of vacation every year.

the other around age 40. Pt has had a breast biopsy several
years ago and states that the results were not concerning. She
says she gets yearly mammograms.

IMAGING:
TTE [**2154-10-21**]:
LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thickness, cavity size, and
global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
PERICARDIUM: Moderate to large pericardial effusion. RV
diastolic collapse, c/w impaired fillling/tamponade physiology.

CONCLUSIONS: Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and
global systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%). There is a
moderate to large sized pericardial effusion. There is right
ventricular diastolic collapse, consistent with impaired
fillling/tamponade physiology.
.
TTE [**2154-10-25**]:
LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV thickness, cavity size and global
systolic function (LVEF>55%)
RIGHT VENTRICLE: chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
No AR, AS. Trivial MR.
PERICARDIUM: stable small echodense pericardial effusion,
consistent with blood, inflammation or other cellular elements.

.
Chest x-ray PA/lat [**2154-10-21**]:
1. Enlarged heart consistent with history of pericardial
effusion.
2. Extensive opacification of the left lung suspicious for
pneumonia. The
amount of left pleural fluid may be better assessed with either
decubitus
views or CT.
