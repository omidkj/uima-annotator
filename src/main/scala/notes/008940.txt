History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 47 y/o female with a history of common variable
immunodeficiency, granulomatous cirrhosis, CRI with recent
admission for gram-positive bacteremia who presents with
hypotension. The patient was noted to have systolic blood
pressures in the 90s yesterday post full course of dialysis. She
presented to interventional radiology this morning for
therapeutic paracentesis and was noted to have systolic blood
pressures in the 80s. At that time, she had no specific
complaints outside of her baseline shortness of breath that is
thought to be related to her significant ascites. 4 days prior,
the patient began to experience blood covered stool. She has had
this previously in the setting of coagulopathy with liver
disease.
.
In the ED inital vitals were, 96 88 81/49 24 88% RA. With
concern for sepsis, she was started on Cefepime and Vancomycin.
She also was hypoxemic to 94% on 5L NC. Oxygen saturation fell
to 77% and she was placed on a NRB. In addition to vanc and
cefepime, she was given 1L NS and 25g 5% albumin.  Labs were
notable for a lactate of 7, a white count of 11.3 with 75%
neutrophils and 5 bands.
