mitral regurgitation

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2129-2-21**] - Mitral Valve Repair (34mm Annuloplasty ring)


History of Present Illness:
This 62 year old gentleman with no signficant past medical
history has had a heart murmur for most of his life. He was
diagnosed with mitral valve prolapse and regurgitation 3 years
ago. At that time he began to be followed with serial
echocardiograms. His mitral regurgitation has worsened over time
with his most recent echo showing severe mitral regurgitation
with partial flail of
anterior mitral leaflet. Given the severity of his mitral valve
regurgitation he has been referred for surgical management. He
denies any symptoms of exertional dyspnea, fatigue, chest
pain,orthopnea or palpitations.

3/19/12PRE-BYPASS:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. No spontaneous echo contrast
or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium/left atrial
appendage or the body of the right atrium/right atrial
appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color
Doppler.
Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global
systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%). Please note the global
LV systolic function might be reduced in the presence of 3+ MR.
[**Name13 (STitle) 167**] ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
The ascending, transverse and descending thoracic aorta are
normal in diameter and free of atherosclerotic plaque to 40 cm
from the incisors.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate/severe anterior leaflet mitral valve prolapse.
The entire leaflet was prolapsing almost suggestive of a
parachute appearance. An eccentric, posteriorly directed jet of
Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The
posterior leaflet appeared normal. There was no mitral annular
calcification. The mitral annulus in the AP direction was 40mm.T
here is no pericardial effusion.
Dr.[**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in person of the results before surgical
incision..

POST-BYPASS:
Patient was on propofol only.
Preserved biventricular systolic function.
LVEF 55%.
The mitral ring is in place, stable and functioning well. No
gradient across the mitral valve during diastole. [**Doctor Last Name **] was a
mild residual MR that was conveyed to the surgeon. Both the
leaflets appeared to coapt very well. Two neo chords supporting
the anterior leaflet going to both the papillary muscles was
visualized.
Rest of the valves appear unchanged from the prebypass period.
Intact thoracic aorta.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2129-2-21**] for surgical
management of his mitral valve disease. He was taken directly to
the Operating Room where he underwent repair of his mitral valve
using a 34mm annuloplasty ring. Please see operative note for
details. Postoperatively he was taken to the intensive care unit
for monitoring. Over the next several hours, he awoke
neurologically intact and was extubated.

On postoperative day one, he was transferred to the step down
unit for further recovery. He was gently diuresed towards his
preoperative weight. The Physical Therapy service was consulted
for assistance with his postoperative strength and mobility. He
did pass 2 kidney stones on POD 2.  This, apparently, is not
unusual for him and he will give them to his PCP for analysis.

He continued to progress and was ready for discharge on POD4.
All follow up appointments were made and instructions given.  He
did have some mild supraventricular ectopy and this resolved
with the addition of oral Amiodarone.
