of a pelvic mass.  The pt reports being in usual state of health

[**10-29**] CXR:
TWO VIEWS OF THE CHEST: Small bilateral pleural effusions
obscure the costophrenic angles, left greater than right. A left
basilar vague opacity is present likely seconday to the
underlying effusion and/or atelectasis. The lungs are otherwise
clear. There is left ventricular enlargement. The bony thorax is
normal.

BILAT LOWER EXT VEINS  [**2165-10-28**] 10:18 AM

IMPRESSION: No evidence of DVT.

Echocardiogram [**2165-10-24**]
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF
70-80%). There is no ventricular septal defect. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic arch is mildly dilated. There are focal calcifications in
the aortic arch. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened and display slightly reduced systolic excursion. There
is no valvular aortic stenosis. The increased transaortic
velocity is likely related to high stroke volume. Mild (1+)
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild to
moderate ([**1-29**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The supporting structures
of the tricuspid valve are thickened/fibrotic. Moderate to
severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is moderate
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
effusion.

CT Abdomen/Pelvis and CTA Chest [**10-23**]
IMPRESSION:

1. No pulmonary embolism.

1. Large, 20-cm complex, cystic pelvic mass with features highly
worrisome for neoplasm. Differential diagnosis would include
such entities as ovarian cystadenocarcinoma. No uterus or
ovaries are specifically identified. Clinical correlation with
surgical history is recommended. Other etiologies such as a
benign, post-surgical peritoneal inclusion cyst are also
possible, but considered less likely. A least one, enlarged,
mildly enhancing lymph node is noted. No evidence of peritoneal
carcinomatosis.

3. There is extensive sigmoid diverticulosis. Mild thickening of
a small segment of the sigmoid colon just inferior and posterior
to the large cystic mass could represent a focal area of
diverticulitis. This area is incompletely characterized
secondary to lack of intraluminal oral contrast. Clinical
correlation is recommended. There is no evidence of bowel
obstruction.

4. Bibasilar atelectasis, right greater than left. No focal
areas of consolidation is identified. A 6-mm, rounded focus in
the right upper lobe of the lung could represent a focal area of
atelectasi
