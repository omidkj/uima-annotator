HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted for apparent upper
GI bleed and a picture consistent with cirrhosis.  The
patient was scoped and showed small varices with no evidence
of active bleeding and diffuse inflammation.  She was started
on Prilosec and her hematocrit was followed closely.  On the
following day she had unexpected drop in her hematocrit and
NG lavage was reperformed, which showed evidence of an active
bleed.  The patient was transferred to the Intensive Care
Unit for a repeat endoscopy, which showed enlarged varices in
the lower third of her esophagus as well as varices at the
fundus, portal hypertensive gastropathy.  The patient was
transfused with blood and octreotide was started while in the
Intensive Care Unit.  She remained stable while in the
Intensive Care Unit on octreotide and propanolol and
Prilosec.  Aldactone was also started.  Repeat endoscopy
several days later showed stable disease and the patient
received banding procedures to her varices.  Eventually tests
returned showing the patient has hepatitis C virus infection
as the etiology of her cirrhosis.  At this point she would
not be a candidate for interferon ribavirin therapy, because
of her comobitity of depression.

The patient was followed closely throughout her stay by the
Psychiatry Service.  The patient was treated with lactulose
for presumptive cirrhotic encephalopathy and seemed to
improve markedly with initial lactulose therapy.  She will be
continued to receive treatment from Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] after
discharge.

The patient was given an empiric course of Ciprofloxacin for
possible SBP and will continue on prophylactic Ciprofloxacin
after discharge.
