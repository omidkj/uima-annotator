Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1928**]
Chief Complaint:
GI bleed

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
87 year-old man CAD s/p distant MI and 3V CABG, chronic systolic
heart failure with EF 30%, h/o Afib not on coumadin, and
multiple cancers (metastatic stage 4 colon + bladder cancer),
with recent admission for N/V/D, diagnosed with ileus s/p NGT
decompression and negative microbiologic workup including
sigmoidoscopy to r/o CMV, complicated by HAP on Vanco and
Cefepime who now presents from [**Last Name (un) 2299**] house for reported HCT 22
and question of GI bleed. Hct was 25.2 on discharge a few days
ago and negative sigmoidoscopy as above. Abd exam unchanged and
trace guaiac + per referring physician.

In the ED, initial vs were: T 99 HR 96 BP:118/50 RR22 O2Sat:99
on NRB. Patient has now been weaned down on NC. On exam patient
had rectal pain, guaiac pos brown stool from below. Noted to
have abdominal distension. He underwent CT Abdomen and Pelvis
which showed tree in [**Male First Name (un) 239**] opacities in bilateral lungs and
bilateral pleural effusions and consolidations consistent with
recent HAP, no SBO. Patient was given Flagyl to cover
gastrointestinal pathogens. Labs revealed HCT of 23.6.
Transfused 1unit pRBCs slowly given EF 30% but also given 1L NS.
New worsening renal function on labs and new trop in the context
of ARF. BPs in high-90s with tachycardia to low 100s in MAT vs
Afib/PVCs so sent to the unit for better monitoring. [**Male First Name (un) **] in case
he rules in.

VS HR 115, 106/58, 23, 97% 3L NC.

EKG: NSR with frequent PACs, normal axis, Q-wave III, AVF
unchanged from prior

ECHO [**2141-2-1**]: The left atrium is normal in size. The
estimated right atrial pressure is 0-5 mmHg. Left ventricular
wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There is mild to
moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
hypokinesis of the septum, inferior, and inferolateral walls.
The remaining segments contract normally (LVEF = 30-35 %). The
estimated cardiac index is normal (>=2.5L/min/m2). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial mitral
regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure
could not be determined. There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Normal left ventricular cavity size with regional
systolic dysfunction c/w CAD.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2138-9-11**], the

findings are similar (heart rate is faster).

CXR [**2141-2-8**]: FINDINGS: Single AP upright portable view of the
chest was obtained. Bilateral perihilar and bilateral lower lobe
opacities are concerning for consolidation due to infectious
process or aspiration. Superimposed edema may also be present.
Patient is status post median sternotomy and CABG. The aorta is
calcified and tortuous. The cardiac silhouette is not enlarged.

CT ABDOMEN AND PELVIS [**2141-2-8**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of bowel obstruction.
2. Bilateral small pleural effusions. Right pleural effusion is
stable since the previous study and the left-sided pleural
effusion is slightly increased in size. Associated bibasilar
atelectasis and consolidation, infectious
process or aspiration can not be excluded.
3. Tree-in-[**Male First Name (un) 239**] opacities within the right middle and bilateral
lower lobes,
likely infectious/inflammatory in nature and could represent
aspiration.
4. Stable pulmonary nodules noted at the bases since [**2141-1-23**], but
increased in size since [**2140-9-20**]. Given history of colon
cancer,
findinces are concerning for metastatic disease, progressed
since [**2140-9-20**], as stated on the previous study.

LEFT LOWER EXTREMITY DOPPLERS [**2141-2-12**]:
IMPRESSION: No evidence of left lower extremity DVT.

ECHO [**2141-2-15**]: Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of
[**2141-2-1**], no change.

CT CHEST [**2141-2-17**] IMPRESSION:
1. Diffuse bronchial wall thickening and peribronchiolar nodular
opacities,
most prominent in the lower lobes bilaterally, which likely
reflect either
infectious bronchiolitis or aspiration.
2. New pulmonary nodule in the left upper lobe, and a growing
nodule in the
right lower lobe. These nodules are concerning for possible
metastatic
lesions. A three-month followup Chest CT is suggested following
appropriate
interval antibiotic therapy to assess for interval growth and to
also
confirm resolution of the above-described airway disease.
3. New small bilateral pleural effusions.
4. Mediastinal lymphadenopathy, increased in size, which may be
reactive in
the setting of acute infectious or inflammatory process.
5. Hepatic hypodensity surrounding a fiducial marker, which
appears larger in size compared to prior study and is
incompletely evaluated.

Hct 26.2

Brief Hospital Course:
87 year-old man readmitted for evaluation of decreased
hematocrit and question of GI bleed.  Pt was hypoxic on
admission requiring 3 liters of oxygen by nasal cannula.  He was
found to have enterococcal bacteremia likely [**12-20**] PICC line.
PICC line was pulled and a repeat ECHO was performed.  No
vegetations were seen on the cardiac valves and only one set of
blood cultures was positive (for Enterococcus) making infectious
endocarditis unlikely.  Left lower extremity doppler was
negative.  The patient was afebrile, without leukocytosis, and
finishing up treatment for PNA from prior admission, so hypoxia
was thought initially be mostly from acute on chronic systolic
heart failure.  Pt was admitted with a weight of about 175# and
volume overloaded on exam.  Gentle diuresis was given with
Furosemide given his [**Month/Day (2) 2091**].  He reached a dry weight of 155# when
he dev
