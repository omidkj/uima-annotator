Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Sulfa (Sulfonamides) / Cardizem

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1515**]
Chief Complaint:
admit to CCU for heart cath


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Right heart catheterization

History of Present Illness:
53 y/o male with history of HTN, atrial fibrillation, possible
diastolic dysfunction, DVT, PE and
cryptogenic cirrhosis from childhood complicated by portal HTN
and variceal hemorrhages.  Patient is currently being worked-up
to be placed on the liver transplant list.
.
On [**2139-3-16**], the patient underwent a right heart catheterization
to assess for pulmonary hypertension that was noted on
[**Date Range 461**].  Found to have elevated right and left sided
filling pressures (RVEDP 16 mmHG, PCWP mean 21 mmHG), Moderate
to severe pulmonary artery hypertension with a PASP of 72 mmHG.
Cardiac index reduced at 1.74 l/min/m2. Pulmonary vascular
resistance markedly elevated at 670 dynes-sec/cm5. Pulmonary
hypertension was not responsive to vasodilator therapy, although
it did decrease to 533 from 594 dynes/cm5.
.
Patient was seen by pulmonary as an outpatient who felt that the
primary cause for his pulmonary hypertension was likely to be
left heart failure with possibly a secondary superimposed
primary pulmonary process either due to chronic PE, or liver
disease.
.
Patient was in his usual state of health until over the weekend
the patient was admitted to a local hospital with hypotension
(80/57) and bradycardia (HR 47).  Apparently had become
encephalopathic at home, and vomitted and was brought to OSH ED.
 Discharged to home with discontinuation of Verapamil. He is now
being readmitted to [**Hospital1 18**] for repeat RHC and likely admission to
CCU for titration of medications, hemodynamic monitoring.
.
Patient reports that at home that he was feeling well.  He
reports stable 2 pillow orthopnea, no PND, no weight gain,
increased LE edema, or exertional chest pain.  He states that he
has in fact lost 10 lbs in the last 3-4 months.
.
In the Cath lab patient had a Swan placed.  PCWP of 25 (mean),
PA pressure 68/30 (mean 51), RV 64/15 (mean 22), RA 16-19. CI
2.5.  Impression was for severe LV diastolic dysfunction,
pulmonary hypertension.  Patient was admitted to the ICU for
tailored diuresis.
.
Cardiac review of systems notable for stable dyspnea on exertion
at about 20-30 feet.  Is able to climb 10 steps without
difficulty, however.

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient is a 53 y/o M w/ h/o cryptogenic cirrhosis, portal
hypertension, pulmonary hypertension, a. fib, admitted for
R-heart cath for demonstration of pulmonary and ventricular
filling pressures and optimization in consideration for liver
transplantation.

Mr. [**Known lastname **] cardiac catheterization revealed resting
hemodynamics with elevated right and left sided filling
pressures (RVEDP 22 mm Hg, PCWP mean 25 mm Hg). There was
moderate to severe pulmonary arterial hypertension (PASP 68 mm
Hg). [**Known lastname **] revealed normal systolic function and
diastolic dysfunction.  Because liver transplantation is
generally contraindicated with mean PA pressures of greater than
35mm Hg, a swan ganz catheter was placed and he was admitted to
the cardiac ICU for careful monitoring and diuresis.  He was
started on amlodipine & lisinopril and diuresed over 10 liters
(with IV lasix drip + bolus, & fluid restriction).  He was
cardioverted out of atrial fibrillation into normal sinus
rhythm.  After 9 days in the CCU,  his mean PA pressure improved
to 31-34 consistently for about 24 hours (eg PA 50/23, mean PA
33).  His dry weight should be considered 177.5lbs.  He was
transitioned to bumex 2mg daily with stable weights.  He should
be followed carefully for weight gain and diuresed as
appropriate.

Mr. [**Known lastname 4702**] was kept on his home regimen of lactulos & rifaxamin
for his ESLD without any evidence of encephalopathy.

He was kept on coumadin for h/o DVT/PE and for atrial fib.  This
can likely be discontinued in 1 month b/c his history of DVT/PE
was over 1 year ago.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 79776**] of hematology has evaluated him
in the past and recommended anticoagulation only for atrial
fibrillation.
