Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 425**]
Chief Complaint:
Fatigue, shortness of breath, cough

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
dual chamber ICD placement

History of Present Illness:
HPI: 76 y/o man w/ a PMH of CAD (s/p stenting in '[**36**]), HTN, DM,
and hypercholesterolemia who presented w/ a several day hx of
fatigue, productive cough, and orthopnea.  He also had poor PO
intake, mild hematemesis, melena, and epigastric pain during
this time period.  It is unclear as to whether his hematemesis
is a primary GI problem or secondary to swallowing bloody
sputum.  The pt denies current CP but says that he has been
having intermittant episodes of CP "since [**Holiday 1451**]".  He
says that his breathing has gotten better since arriving on the
floor.  He has not had any recent fevers, diarrhea, dizziness,
palpatations, or HA.
.
In the ER his EKG revealed a ventricular rate in the high 30s w/
2nd degree Mobitz block type II (3:1 conduction) in the context
of a LBBB. He hypertension and HR did not respond to atropine or
carotid massage and he was taken to the EP lab for placement of
a dual chambered ICD.  He tolerated this procedure well and was
transfered to the CCU for diuresis for a possible CHF flare.  He
was also sent for nitro gtt control of his hypertension.

ECHO ([**2138-7-1**])
Conclusions:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There is severe global
left ventricular hypokinesis. No masses or thrombi are seen in
the left ventricle. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Mild (1+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
structurally normal. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Moderate
(2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

Compared with the report of the prior study (tape unavailable
for review) of [**2136-7-27**], left ventricular cavity size is
smaller, but global systolic function is more depressed. The
severity of mitral regurgitation is minimally increased and mild
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension is now identified.
.
MIBI ([**2138-7-1**])
IMPRESSION: 1.  Reversible, mild myocardial perfusion defects
involving the septum and apex at the level of exercise achieved.

2.  Transit ischemic dilatation with EF of 29% raises the
possibility of more extensive perfusion abnormalities than
suggested by the relatively mild asymmetries in uptake.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P:  Pt is a 76 y/o man w/ a PMH of CAD (s/p stenting in '[**36**]),
HTN, DM, and hypercholesterolemia who presented w/ a several day
hx of fatigue, productive cough, and orthopnea.  On further ROS,
he noted hemotypsis and weight loss over the past few months.
He received a dual chamber ICD in the EP lab for his heart block
and was transfered to the CCU for management of his CHF and HTN.
 His hctz was d/c and he was started on lasix.  He diuresed well
on this regimen and his SOB improved markedly throughout his
course.  His HTN was controlled initally through nitro drip.
However, this was d/c on the 1st post-op day and his htn was
then controlled by titrating his captopril to 50tid and his
metoprolol xl to 50qd.  He did well with these medications.  His
initial Cxr was significant for chf and a questionable
infiltrate and he was started on renally dosed levoquin for
possilbe pna.  As his CHF cleared, a LLL infiltrate was seen on
CXR and flagyl was added to cover possible aspiration pna.  He
ran a low grade fever on the 2nd post-op day but defervesed w/
continued abx.  His cx have all been negative to date.  Because
of his travel hx and possible exposure, a ppd was placed and a
blood smear was performed and both were negative.
.
1. SOB - pt w/ a several day hx of SOB and fatigue, seen to be
in high degree block in the ER requiring ICD placement.  pt also
w/ productive cough, cxr c/w pna, and wbc=12.8 during this time.
 sob likely due to either an acute chf flare in the context of
his heart block or pneumonia
* cxr/cough/wbc c/w pna
   -continue levoquin/flagyl
   -follow fever curve and cbc -> pt has been afebrile since [**9-5**]
   -CXR w/ new LLL infiltrate
      -flagyl added for aspiration bugs
   -blood smear negative
   -ppd negative
* chf flare in setting of heart block and chronic CHF also
possible
   -diurese in the CCU to a goal of negative 1-2L/day (euvolemic
last
    night

   -d/c home on lasix 40mg po qd
.
2. Heart block - pt presented w/ a 2nd degree type 2 block w/
3-to-1 conduction and hypertension.  he received a dual chamber
ICD and had been persistently hypertensive in the ccu but is

* f/u w/ EP as an outpatient at device clinic
.
3. HTN - pt persistently hypertensive in the ER and after his
ICD intervention despite atropine and carotid massage
* pt's bp well controlled now on his meds
