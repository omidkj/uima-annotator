Pertinent Results:
[**2150-12-4**]
PRE-CPB:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. No spontaneous echo
contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium or
left atrial appendage.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. There is
mild global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 40-45 %).
Doppler parameters are most consistent with Grade I (mild) left
ventricular diastolic dysfunction. Hypokinesis is more notable
in the basal inferior wall.
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
There are grade 3 atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
There are three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets
are severely thickened/deformed. The right and non-coronary
leaflets appear to have minimal mobility. There is critical
aortic valve stenosis (valve area <0.8cm2). Mild (1+) aortic
regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is chordal [**Male First Name (un) **] which is a normal
variant.
POST-CPB:
A bioprosthetic valve is seen in the aortic position. The valve
is well seated and leaflets are freely mobile. There is no
apparent paravalvular leak. Pk gradient across the valve is
15mmHg, the mean gradient is 8mmHg with CO of 4.9.
There is concentric LVH. The global systolic function appears
mildly improved.

Final Report
HISTORY: AVR.

FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**12-6**], there are
continued
low lung volumes. Bilateral pleural effusions persist and may be
slightly
increasing on the left. Minimal atelectatic changes are seen at
the bases,
especially on the left. No definite vascular congestion or
pleural effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the hospital and brought to the
operating room on [**2150-12-4**] where the patient underwent aortic
valve replacement with a 23-mm [**Known firstname **] Magna Ease aortic valve
bioprosthesis, coronary bypass grafting x2 with left internal
mammary artery to left anterior descending coronary; reverse
saphenous vein single graft from aorta to the distal right
coronary artery. Overall the patient tolerated the procedure
well and post-operatively was transferred to the CVICU in stable
condition for recovery and invasive monitoring. POD 1 found the
patient extubated, alert and oriented and breathing comfortably.
 The patient was neurologically intact and hemodynamically
stable on no inotropic or vasopressor support.  Beta blocker was
initiated and the patient was gently diuresed toward the
preoperative weight.  The patient was transferred to the
telemetry floor for further recovery.  Chest tubes and pacing
wires were discontinued without complication.  The patient has a
history of COPD and was given nebs and attempted to wean off
oxygen.  At the time of discharge his saturations were 90-92% on
room air.  The patient was evaluated by the physical therapy
service for assistance with strength and mobility.  On POD # 4
he did fall after attempting to catch his falling roommate.  He
sustained no injuries from this fall.  By the time of discharge
on POD 5 the patient was ambulating freely, the wound was
healing and pain was controlled with oral analgesics.  The
patient was discharged home with visitng nurse services in good
condition with appropriate follow up instructions.
