Findings
LEFT ATRIUM: Marked LA enlargement.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thickness, cavity size and
regional/global systolic function (LVEF >55%).

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Mildly dilated RV cavity. Normal RV systolic
function.

AORTA: Normal aortic diameter at the sinus level. Normal
ascending aorta diameter. Mildly dilated aortic arch.

AORTIC VALVE: ?# aortic valve leaflets. Moderately thickened
aortic valve leaflets. Moderate AS (area 1.0-1.2cm2)

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. No MVP.
Mild mitral annular calcification. Mild thickening of mitral
valve chordae. Trivial MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets. Moderate to
severe [3+] TR. Moderate PA systolic hypertension.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflet.
No PS. Physiologic PR.

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: The rhythm appears to be atrial fibrillation.

Conclusions
The left atrium is markedly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are
normal (LVEF >55%). The right ventricular cavity is mildly
dilated with normal free wall contractility. The aortic arch is
mildly dilated. The number of aortic valve leaflets cannot be
determined. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened.
There is moderate aortic valve stenosis (valve area 1.0-1.2cm2).
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no
mitral valve prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There
is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Moderate aortic stenosis. Preserved regional and
global biventricular systolic function. Moderate to severe
tricuspid regurgitation. Moderate pulmonary hypertension.

Brief Hospital Course:
Transferred in from [**Doctor First Name 5279**] in NH on [**3-26**] for surgery. He
required IV heparin and NTG pre-operatively. Pre-operative
workup completed and he underwent surgery on [**3-29**] with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
Transferred to the CVICU in stable condition on titrated
epinephrine, phenylephrine, and propofol drips. Had developed
tamponade and returned to the OR for re-exploration on the
following morning [**3-30**]. Extubated later that afternoon without
complications. Coumadin restarted for Atrial fibrillation.
Transferred to the floor on POD #3 to begin increasing his
activity level. Chest tubes and pacing wires removed per
protocol. Gently diuresed toward his preop weight. He had
urinary retention which required foley reinsertion and being
discharged with foley to rehab on ampicillin until foley
removed.  He was ready for discharge to rehab [**4-4**]. He was
discharged to rehab at Pleasantview in [**Location (un) **] [**Location (un) 3844**].
