Chief Complaint:
shortness of breath.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
The patient is a [**Age over 90 **] year old man with history of CAD s/p MI,
dementia, depression, COPD who presents with acute shortness of
breath. He presented from his [**Hospital3 **] facility with
shortness of breath. He was found to be wheezing and tachypneic
with worsening lower extremity edema. He was referred to the ED
for further evaluation.
.
Upon arrival in the ED, his initial vital signs were 97.7 78
130/96 24 88%RA -> 99%NRB. An CXR was read as pulmonary edema
with potential multi-focal pneumonia. He was placed on BiPaP for
oxygenation support. He received levofloxacin, ceftriaxone,
solumedrol, atrovent, albuterol, and nitroglycerin.
.
He denies chest pain, cough, palpitations or fevers.

On review of symptoms, he denies recent fevers, chills or
rigors. He denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the
other review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

Brief Hospital Course:
[**Age over 90 **] year old man with hx of CAD s/p distant MI, HTN, presenting
with acute shortness of breath and CHF.
.
# CAD/Ischemia: new onset acute CHF with elevated biomarkers and
new EKG abnormalities likely induced by recent ischemic event.
In discussion with [**Hospital 228**] healthcare proxy, and to the extent
possible, the patient himself, the team agreed that medical
management rather than aggressive procedures was most consistent
with the patient's goals of care. His cardiac enzymes declined
during his admission and serial EKGs did not suggest a second
event. He was diuresed and given ASA and statin. He was started
on metoprolol but after having some wheezing was changed to
carvedilol. He had a 48 hour heparin drip, and a nitro drip
during the first day of his admission. The palliative care
service was consulted, and together with palliative care, the
[**Hospital 228**] healthcare proxy decided that hospice was the next
appropriate place for care. He was discharged to hospice on
[**2147-4-10**].
.
# Pump: The patient came in with acute systolic congestive heart
failure based on CXR, elevated BNP, and TTE findings; likely
this was due to an ischemic trigger. With diuresis and
carvedilol his breathing and comfort improved considerably.
.
# Rhythm: Mr [**Known lastname 34210**] was mostly in sinus rhythm; he had some
overnight episodes of supraventricular tachycardia of unclear
type but without ongoing consequences.
.
# Valves: There was no significant valvular pathology on TTE.
.
# Respiratory Distress/Hypoxia: He was having considerable
difficulty with breathing when he first arrived, and as above
this appeared to be most consistent with CHF. He did not have
cough, fever or other abnormality to point toward pneumonia.
Initially his chest x-ray could not rule out pneumonia but did
begin to clear during his admission in a manner more consistent
with resolution of pulmonary edema. Blood cultures did not
suggest bacteremia though they were still "no growth to date"
rather than final by the time the patient was discharged to
hospice.
.
# Mental status: Mr [**Known lastname 105609**] lucidity waxed and waned and
he had significant problems with sundowning and agitation at
night, often trying to get out of bed at night and demanding to
go home. He tended to be calmer at day, usually with evidence of
dementia and memory and cognitive problems, but remaining
pleasant and amiable. His seroquel dose was increased. He has
had parkinsonian reactions to haloperidol in the past, so this
medicine was not given. We avoided benzodiazepines in this
elderly patient.
.
# Metabolic Acidosis: Anion gap was likely from mild renal
failure; may be some contribution of inflammation/ischemia;
electrolyte abnormalities resolved during his admission.
.
# Hyponatremia: He had sodium levels down to 128 during this
admission, likely secondary to CHF, volume overload and poor
forward flow, with this kidney poorly perfused and Cr clearance
down. He had normal sodium level on discharge.
.
# Acute renal failure: His creatinine rose to 2.3 from a prior
baseline of 1.2-1.3. This was most likely from poor forward flow
from volume overload and CHF. His creatinine was declining again
by the time of discharge, to 1.8 on day of discharge.
.
# FEN: Heart healthy diet
.
# Prophylaxis: PPI at home dose, heparin
