HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Patient is a 65-year-old male,
who presented to the Emergency Room with an infected right
antecubital A-V graft, which had been removed [**2172-7-7**].
Since that surgery, the area has been erythematous, swollen,
and painful.  Patient has had low grade temperatures to 99.5
and the night before admission the patient noticed a clot
eroding through his skin.  He was seen in hemodialysis and
referred to the Emergency Room.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. End-stage renal disease secondary to diabetic nephropathy
status post left arm A-V fistula x2.
2. Status post multiple thrombectomies.
3. Status post failed central line placement for
hemodialysis.
4. Status post A-V fistula removal.
5. Patient has had diabetes mellitus x35 years.
6. Coronary artery disease status post CABG.
7. Status post cerebrovascular accident with residual left
sided weakness.

MEDICATIONS AT HOME:
1. Actos 30 mg p.o. q.d.
2. Renagel p.o. q.d.
3. Isosorbide dinitrate 20 mg t.i.d.
4. Atenolol 25 mg p.o. q.d.
5. Lipitor 10 mg p.o. q.d.
6. 70/30, 20 and 20.
7. Lasix 80 mg p.o. q.d.

9. Levaquin 500 mg p.o. after hemodialysis.
10. Zoloft 25 mg q.d.
11. Digoxin 1.25 mg Tuesdays, Thursdays, Saturdays.

ALLERGIES:
1. Keflex.
2. Vancomycin.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient does not smoke or drink alcohol.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Patient was afebrile and vital signs
were stable complaining of pain in the right upper extremity,
in mild distress, alert and oriented times three.  Lungs were
clear to auscultation bilaterally.  Heart was regular, rate,
and rhythm, no murmurs.  Abdomen was soft, nontender,
nondistended, positive bowel sounds.  Patient had total
femoral tunneled left femoral Permacath in the left groin.
Right upper extremity was swollen, erythematous, and there
was a positive pulsatile clot eroding through the skin.

SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was seen in the
Emergency Department by the senior transplant resident.
Patient was then emergently taken to the OR for removal of
the infected pseudoaneurysmal A-V graft stump on the right
upper extremity.  For detailed accounts of report, see
operative report.  Postoperatively, the patient went to the
floor with a temporary femoral catheter for hemodialysis in
the right groin.  The left catheter was removed, and tip was
sent off for culture as well as a tissue culture from the
excised right A-V graft stump.

Patient was taken back to the OR in an attempt to place a
Permacath in a central vein in the upper torso either in the
left or the right IJ or the right or left subclavian.  After
numerous attempts, access was not able to be obtained.
Patient returned to the floor.  Following that procedure, the
patient was taken to IR for access guided by fluoroscopy and
venography.  At this time, the patient was discovered very
tortuous central veins as well as a completely occluded right
IJ.  Again at this time, no line was placed.  Patient was
taken back to the floor and scheduled for a MR venogram.  MR
venogram showed completely occluded right IJ with numerous
collaterals and possible access via the left subclavian.  The
patient was scheduled for Interventional Radiology the next
day for recanalization of occluded vessels in an attempt to
place a Permacath for hemodialysis.

The day of procedure the patient and his family were informed
of the risks involved rupture of the vessel, massive bleeding
within the chest.  At that time the patient declined to have
the procedure and instead requested Interventional
Radiologist to make his right femoral hemodialysis catheter a
permanent one.  His right femoral catheter was tunneled, and
the patient was returned to the floor.

During his hospital course, the patient grew out MRSA from
his tissue culture as well as from his blood cultures taken
from the original tunneled left groin catheter.  Patient was
placed on linezolid 600 mg b.i.d. and ID consult was
consulted throughout this hospital course.  Patient underwent
extensive workup with regards to infectious disease including
transthoracic echocardiogram as well as transesophageal
echocardiogram to rule out echocardiogram.

After the infected catheter was taken out, subsequent blood
cultures were all negative.  Patient was D/C'd on an
additional two weeks of linezolid 600 mg b.i.d.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Stable.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  To home.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1. Infected right arteriovenous graft stump.
2. End-stage renal disease.

cultures.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1. Isosorbide dinitrate 20 mg p.o. t.i.d.
2. Atenolol 25 mg p.o. q.d.
3. Lipitor 10 mg p.o. q.d.
4. Lasix 80 mg p.o. q.d.
5. Calcitriol 0.25 mcg p.o. q.d.
6. Sertraline 25 mg p.o. q.d.
7. Protonix 40 mg p.o. q.d.
8. Digoxin 125 mcg Tuesdays, Thursdays, Saturdays.
9. Linezolid 600 mg p.o. b.i.d. x3 weeks.
