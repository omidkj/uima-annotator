[**6-25**] CT Head: IMPRESSION: 1. No evidence of acute intracranial
hemorrhage or major vascular territorial infarct. If there is
high suspicion, MRI with DWI is more sensitive for acute
ischemia.  2. Complete opacification of the right mastoid sinus
with mild opacification of left mastoid sinus, indicating
probable chronic mastoiditis. No evidence of basilar skull
fracture.
.
[**6-26**]  IMPRESSION:  1. Stable or resolving CHF.  2. Persistent
mediastinal widening warrants further evaluation with CTA of the
chest. Given multiple mediastinal calcifications, mediastinal
prominence may be related to underlying lymphadenopathy.  3.
Persistent left lung base consolidation may be related to
asymmetric pulmonary edema or an underlying consolidation. This
may also be further evaluated with CT.

and pr

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
71 year old woman with ESRD admitted pre HD with respiratory
distress
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
Please compare to prior film for improvement of edema and
progression of PNA
INDICATION: 71-year-old female with end-stage renal disease
admitted pre- hemodialysis with respiratory distress.

COMPARISON: AP upright portable chest x-ray dated [**2181-6-25**].

AP SUPINE PORTABLE CHEST X-RAY: Bilateral interstitial edema is
stable or slightly decreased since prior exam. Mediastinal
widening persists, unchanged, and requires further evaluation
with cross-sectional imaging. Punctate calcifications projecting
over bilateral hila are related to prior granulomatous
infection, and could be accounting for the mediastinal widening.
Increased opacification in the left lower lobe may be related to
asymmetric pulmonary edema; however, an underlying consolidation
is not excluded. The surrounding soft tissues are unchanged.

IMPRESSION:
1. Stable or resolving CHF.
2. Persistent mediastinal widening warrants further evaluation
with CTA of the chest. Given multiple mediastinal
calcifications, mediastinal prominence may be related to
underlying lymphadenopathy.
3. Persistent left lung base consolidation may be related to
asymmetric pulmonary edema or an underlying consolidation. This
may also be further evaluated with CT.

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST

Reason: MENTAL STATUS CHANGE

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
71 year old woman with ESRD, sarcoid presented with hypoxia now
with ? mental status change after hypotensive episode during
hemodialysis
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
Please assess for stroke
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.

INDICATION: End-stage renal disease and sarcoid, presenting with
mental status changes and hypotensive episode after
hemodialysis. Assess for stroke.

No prior examinations.

NONCONTRAST HEAD CT: There is no acute intracranial hemorrhage,
shift of normally midline structures, or major vascular
territorial infarct. There are chronic-appearing lacunes in the
basal ganglia, bilaterally. [**Doctor Last Name **]- white matter differentiation
is preserved. Dural calcifications are noted. There is extensive
calcification of the vertebral and cavernous carotid arteries,
related to underlying renal disease. The right mastoid air cells
and middle ear cavity are completely opacified, with a small
amount of fluid in the dorsal aspect of the left mastoid apex
and clear left middle ear; however, there is no evidence of
basilar skull fracture. The visualized paranasal sinuses are
clear.
.
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage or major
vascular territorial infarct. If there is high suspicion, MRI
with DWI is more sensitive for acute ischemia.
.
2. Complete opacification of the right mastoid process and
middle ear, with small amount of fluid in the left mastoid apex,
indicating probable chronic left otomastoiditis, which should be
correlated clinically.
.
No evidence of basilar skull fracture.

Brief Hospital Course:
ASSESSMENT: The patient is a 71 yo woman presenting with ESRD
due for dialysis today who had acute onset of SOB.
.
PLAN:
.
# Respiratory Distress:  Was on Bipap on admission in setting of
volume overload. Pt underwent HD and henceforth did not require
non-invasive ventilation and returned to her baseline of 2
liters of oxygen. There was also a suggestion of a left lower
lobe pneumonia on CXR.  CT Chest showed a left pleural effusion
and enlarged right mediastinal LAD that was c/w her hx of
pulmonary sarcoidosis.  There was no evidence of any aortic
pathology.
A course of Levofloxacin 250 mg PO Q48 was initiated during her
stay.  She was to continue to complete a 10 day course.
.
# ESRD: Pt is on q MWF HD schedule with fistula (mature) in L
arm.
- MWF HD  - received dialysis (3 kilos off on Monday) and also
underwent HD on day of discharge. Captopril was held on HD days
given propensity for hypotension.
Continued nephrocaps, renagel.
.
# UTI: Found on UA in ED but cultures negative.  Will be covered
by Levaquin for CAP as above.
.
# Troponin Leak: Unclear of baseline, probably [**2-16**] ESRD.
- Felt to be secondary to chronic renal insufficiency versus
acute ischemia. They remained flat in the setting of a norm
