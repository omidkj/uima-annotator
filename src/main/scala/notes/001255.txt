History of Present Illness:
89 yo female with recent dx of metastatic adenocarcinoma of the
gallbladder with invasion of hte right colon and with liver
metastasis now s/p ccy and right colectomy presents from her
rehab facility with worsening resp status.  Pt initally admitted
to [**Hospital1 18**] [**Last Name (un) 4068**] on [**2178-8-29**] with abd pain.  CT scan showed mass
in BG.  Pt underwent open laparotomy.  Her post-op course was
complicated by GI bleed felt to be [**2-5**] erosions at anastomotic
site, CHF with labile BP after diresis, hypercarbic resp
failure, PNA with highly resistent Enterobacter, Pseudomonas and
MRSA, treated with 14 days of Vanc, Aztreonam and Flagyl.  She
was discharged to rehab facility on [**10-12**] with the regimen of 4
hours on Bipap and 4 hours off due to her hypercarbic resp
failure.  Over the last day, pt required continuous BIPAP and
has had worsening resp status.
.
In [**Name (NI) **], pt found to have ABG of 7.25/81/145.  Pt received
Vanc/Levo/Flagyl for presumed PNA and elevated WBC.  Pt is
DNR/DNI.

Brief Hospital Course:
89 yo f with metastatic cholangiocarcinoma p/w worsening
hypercarbic resp failure.

# RESP FAILURE:
Pt had ongoing hypercarbic resp failure requiring intermittent
BIPAP at nursing home, then requiring full time bipap on
admission.  Resp failure was [**2-5**] decompensated CHF, which was
evident on physical exam and on xray.  Her BNP was over 60,000.
The goal was to diurese her with IV lasix but this was limited
by her low bp.
.
She was afebrile but she had leukocytosis with left shift, which
raises the possibility of PNA also.  She was pan-cultured and
started emperically on vanc and meropenem.
.
She continued to decompensate, becoming acidemic, hypoxic and
hypercarbic.  She developed acute renal failure from diuresis
and poor foward flow.  The family decided, given the patients
multiple medical problems including a poor prognosis from
metastatic cholangiocarcinoma and end stage heart failure, to
make the patient comfort measure only.
.
The patient expired on [**2178-10-20**] at 4:35 AM.
.
# UTI: culture sent.  Covered emperically with vanc and
meropenem.
.
# Cholangiocarcinoma: Pt has metastasis to liver and colon, s/p
ccy and right colectomy.  There were no futher plans for
intervention.
.
# PMR: chronic steroids
