Brief Hospital Course:
## Respiratory Distress / Tracheal obstruction: The patient was
initially admitted to the unit for concerns over respiratory
compromise. She was breathing comfortably with NC oxygen and was
transferred to the medical floor. She underwent tracheal
stenting by interventional pulmonary with no complications. She
was also treated with nebs and steroids. On the day of discharge
she was sat'ing in the mid 90's on room air. She was discharged
to home with strict instructions to return to the ED immediately
should she have any respiratory difficulties.
.
## NSCLC: the pt was evaluated by rad onc while in house but
since she was planning to be treated at [**Hospital6 **]
and her tumor did not require emergent radiation, she was
discharged with instructions to follow up with her oncologists
at [**Hospital6 **] the following day.
.
## Bronchitis - there was initially a question as to whether or
not the pt needed to be treated for a questionable infection.
However, she remained afebrile and WBC count was not elevated,
so levofloxacin was d/c'd.
.
## Endocrine - Pt was placed on RISS given use of steroids. Her
sugars remained below 200, however, and since the steroids were
being tapered she was not discharged with an outpatient regimen.
She will discuss this with her oncologist at [**Hospital3 60338**].
