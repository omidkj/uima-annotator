Pertinent Results:
ECG: 80 bpm nl axis, nl int, twi v4-v6. 0.5mm STd in V5. TwIs
new compared to [**2-14**] 1826.
.
Radiology:
CXR [**2-14**]:(radiology resident wet read) "Patchy opacity throughout
the right middle lobe. _____ signs of volume loss and
atelectasis is a diagnostic consideration, given history
aspiration cannot be entirely excluded. Recommend close
radiological observation and clinical correlation."
.
head CT [**2-14**]: No hemorrhage or mass effect.
.
TTE [**7-19**]: The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular
wall thickness, cavity size, and systolic function are normal
(LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally
normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. Mild (1+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.


Brief Hospital Course:
MICU Course:
.
# delerium: presentation was initially concerning for LMCA
occlusion given findings particularly in the setting of elevated
blood pressure.  opiate effect also considered although
respiratory rate relatively high.  there was also concern for
encephalitis given fever and altered mental status.
Differential also included hyperosmolar coma given elevated
blood sugars.  Pt seen by [**Month/Year (2) **] service who recommended
empiric acyclovir given fever and altered mental status, as well
as   MRI/MRA, and LP.  However, after one night of fluids,
patient's mental status returned to baseline with return of
blood sugars to ~100s.  [**Month/Year (2) 878**] agreed and so MRI/MRA, LP,
acyclovir cancelled.  Altered mental status attributed to
hyperglycemia.
.
# hyperglycemia: possibly occurring in the setting of infection
as some question of pneumonia.  + for urine and serum ketones at
OSH but clinically seems more on the spectrum of hyperosmolar
coma.  AG closed on MICU presentation, pt placed on insulin gtt
with rapid resolution of blood sugars to <200.  [**Last Name (un) **] consulted
and patient returned to outpatient regime.
.
Multiple myeloma workup performed given h/o of MGUS and concern
that evolution to MM may have precipitated sudden elevation of
glucose. Skeletal survey negative. SPEP/UPEP pending.
.
.
# fever- initially converning for encephalitis versus PNA, but
more likely [**3-17**] pneumonitis/pneumonia in the setting of
aspiration.  pt switched from levo/flagyl to augmentin.  Blood
cultures NGTD.
.
.
# cardiac: pt with lateral TWI on presentation, unclear
etiology.  Did not appear to be rate related subendocardial
ischemia.  Not classically appearing cerebral Tw.  cardiac
enzymes negative x 2.  EKGs changes returned to baseline with
improved BP control.  Pt with some diastolic CHF based on TTE
[**7-19**], most likely [**3-17**] HTN.  No recent coronary angiograph or
recent stress test.  No evidence of CHF (no edema, JVD).  Pt
restarted on metoprolol 25 mg po bid, titrated up to 50 mg po
bid, and continued on atorvastatin.
.
.
Medical Floor Course:
.
pt admitted to the medical service hemodynamically stable,
without focal neurological deficit, weaned off of insulin gtt
with fsbs < 200, with ongoing SBPs 170s-180s, without CP/SOB.
.
# mental status changes: initially pt considered for meningitis/
infection, however neuro changes resolved with improved with
correction of blood sugars.  Pt without focal neurological
deficits at time of transfer, though ?right carotid bruit, with
negative carotid dopplers.  Plan is for pt to be followed by
[**Month/Day (2) **] clinic in 4 weeks. (will provide with number to call:
[**Telephone/Fax (1) 2528**]).
.
.
# hyperglycemia: etiology somewhat unclear, infection possible,
reportedly gap and ketone gap positive at OSH, however was
negative without ketones at presentation to [**Hospital1 18**].  pt being
treated with augmentin 7d course for question of pneumonia,
though not clearly evident on CXR.  pt seen by [**Last Name (un) 387**], with
improved control off insulin gtt with new recs (new humulog
sliding scale and glargine 35 units QPM).  Pt discharged with
plan for follow-up within 4 weeks with PCP and [**Name9 (PRE) **].
.
.
# multiple myeloma: pt with h/o MGUS, though not active.
multiple myeloma workup performed with UPEP pending given h/o of
MGUS and concern that evolution to MM may have precipitated
sudden elevation of glucose; however, skeletal survey negative.

.
.
# cardiac:  regarding ischemia, on presentation EKG with lateral
ischemia, resolving at time of transfer. cardiac enzymes
unremarkable.  pt denies CP/SOB.  pt already on aspirin,
bblocker, [**Last Name (un) **], statin.  regimen uptitrated to improve bp
control.  regarding pump, pt with some diastolic CHF based on
TTE [**7-19**], though no evidence of CHF on presentation (pt without
edema, JVD).  etiology of dCHF most likely HTN, BP regimen
optimized as below.  pt continued on home atorvastatin 10 mg po
qd.
.
# htn: pt with h/o htn.  restarted on metoprolol 25 [**Hospital1 **] and
losartan 50 mg qd in MICU.  Upon arrival to the medical floor,
her SBPs were ~170-180s.  Her metoprol was titrated up to 50 mg
po bid.  She was then restarted on her amlodipine 5 mg po qdaily
and her losartan was increased to 100mg qdaily as her heart rate
was in the 60s.
.
.
# fever: afebrile at time of transfer, most likely [**3-17**]
pneumonia, possible aspiration.  pt without SOB, no cough, no
hypoxia at time of transfer to medical service.  pt started on
augmentin in MICU and will complete 7 day course (day 1 is
[**2130-2-15**]).  blood cultures and urine cultures NGTD.
.
.
# anemia: pt has chronic anemia likely related to MGUS versus
CRI. iron studies were within normal limits.  she is presently
within her baseline of 25-28.  no intervent
