Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2122-2-12**] Aortic Valve Replacement (23mm St. [**Male First Name (un) 923**] Porcine), PFO
closure

History of Present Illness:
79-year-old female who presented to [**Hospital 11333**] Hospital in [**Month (only) 956**]
with dyspnea and was found to be in congestive heart failure and
atrial fibrillation. She was worked up and an echocardiogram
showed that she had severe aortic valve stenosis with an aortic
valve area of 0.8 cm2. Her left ventricular ejection fraction
was 55%. There was also a question of patent foramen ovale
closure since she was found to have a small left-to-right shunt
with an atrial septal aneurysm noted on the echocardiogram. She
underwent cardiac catheterization and this showed no significant
coronary artery disease.

[**Name (NI) 2325**]: Carotid 2+ Femoral 2+ dopplerable DP/PT

Pertinent Results:
[**2-12**] Echo: No thrombus is seen in the left atrial appendage. A
patent foramen ovale is present. A left-to-right shunt across
the interatrial septum is seen at rest. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The remaining left ventricular segments
contract normally. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. There are simple atheroma in the aortic root.
There are simple atheroma in the ascending aorta. There are
simple atheroma in the aortic arch. There are simple atheroma in
the descending thoracic aorta. There are three aortic valve
leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets are severely
thickened/deformed. There is severe aortic valve stenosis (valve
area 0.8-1.0cm2). The mitral valve leaflets are structurally
normal. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is no
pericardial effusion. Post Bypass: The patient is now s/p 23 [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]
[**Male First Name (un) 1525**] Bioprosthetic aortic valve placement The patient is now
on a neosynephrine drip @0.4mcg/kg/min,and AV sequentially
paced. The aortic valve is well seated,with no regurgitation and
a mean gradient of 4mmhg at a cardiac index of 1.9. There is
mitral regurgitation which is similar to prebypass and is 1+.
There is Moderate Tricuspid regurgitation. LV function is
preserved and EF is similar to prebypass @ 45-50%.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 89904**] was a same day admit and was brought to the
operating room on [**2-12**] where she underwent an aortic valve
replacement and PFO closure. Please see operative report for
surgical details. Following surgery she was transferred to the
CVICU for invasive monitoring in stable condition. Within 24
hours she was weaned from sedation, awoke neurologically intact
and extubated. On post-op day one she was started on beta
blockers and diuretics and she was gently diuresed towards her
pre-op weight. She went into atrial fibrillation and was given
Amiodarone and beta-blockers. Chest tubes were removed and she
was transferred to the step-down floor on post-op day two.
Coumadin was initiated for her atrial fibrillation and titrated
for goal INR. Epicardial pacing wires were removed per protocol.
She worked with physical therapy during her post-op course for
strength and mobility. On post-op day five she appeared to be
doing well and was discharged to rehab with the appropriate
medications and follow-up appointments.
