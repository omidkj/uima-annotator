Conclusions
The left atrium is elongated. The patient is mechanically
ventilated. The IVC is small, consistent with an RA pressure of
<10mmHg. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are
normal. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion
abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
present. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is
moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Probably low normal overall systolic function. Mild
mitral regurgitation. Moderate tricuspid regurgitation. Moderate
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.

The right internal jugular line tip is most likely at the
cavoatrial junction.
The cardiomediastinal silhouette is difficult to appreciate
given the
bilateral increase in pleural effusion and perihilar opacities
consistent with worsening of pulmonary edema. Aspiration can
also be included in differential diagnosis. The patient is after
recent abdominal surgery. Contrast material is demonstrated in
the bowel.

**FINAL REPORT [**2131-9-10**]**

   URINE CULTURE (Final [**2131-9-10**]):
      GRAM NEGATIVE ROD(S).    ~1000/ML.
      STAPHYLOCOCCUS SPECIES.    ~1000/ML.


Brief Hospital Course:
This is a [**Age over 90 **] year old female with abdominal pain, nausea,
vomiting. Imaging at
[**Location (un) 620**] noted an ileocolic intussuception that is likely due to
a lead point of tumor or polyp.  This is causing a small bowel
obstruction. She agreed to surgery and went to the OR on [**2131-9-6**]
for: Exploratory laparotomy, right colectomy, ileocolic
anastomosis, open cholecystectomy and transgastric feeding
jejunostomy

Post-op Acute Respiratory Failure: Post-operatively she went
into respiratory failure mid day. TTE done by fellow [**Last Name (un) 16997**] Tan
showed mild global hypokinesis and worsened TR (baseline 2+).
She received 1U PRBC for acute post-op blood loss anemia.
She was reintubated.

Post-op Atrial Fibrillation/Tachycardia: She was cardioverted in
PACU for chronic afib with RVR to 120s as her BP dropped to 70s.
She was flipping between sinus 40-60s and afib with slow
ventricular response to 40-60s. She eventually was in sinus
rhythm. Once on the floor, she had episodes of post-op
bradycardia and so her Lopressor was held. On POD 8, her
Lopressor was restarted secondary to tachycardic episodes.

She went to the ICU post-op for close monitoring.
She was transferred out of ICU on [**9-8**].

Post-op UTI: On [**9-9**]: UA+-->GNR & Staph <1000/mL. She was
treated with Cipro for a UTI.

Difficult to Arouse: The patient was triggered for nursing
concern. The patient was hard to arouse and not waking to
sternal rub, but had stable vital signs. She went for imaging on
[**9-10**] HEAD CT: No hemmorhage. CXR: incr b/l effusion, worseing
pulm edema vs. aspiration.
This episode passed and she was alert and oriented and back at
her baseline.

FEN: She was NPO with IVF. She was started on trophic
tubefeedings and the tubefeedings were ramped up to goal. Once
more awake and alert, her diet was slowly advanced and she was
tolerating a regular diet at time of discharge. Her tubefeedings
should continue for at least 3 months.

Abd: Her abdomen was soft and nontender. The staples were
removed prior to discharge and steri strips applied.
