Findings
LEFT ATRIUM: Dilated LA.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Normal RA size.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thickness, cavity size and
regional/global systolic function (LVEF >55%).

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTA: Normal aortic diameter at the sinus level. Normal
ascending aorta diameter. Focal calcifications in ascending
aorta. Normal aortic arch diameter. Focal calcifications in
aortic arch. Normal descending aorta diameter. Simple atheroma
in descending aorta.

AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (3). Mild
AS (area 1.2-1.9cm2).

MITRAL VALVE: Normal mitral valve leaflets with trivial MR.
Physiologic MR (within normal limits).

TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets with trivial
TR.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflet.
No PS. Physiologic PR.

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify I was present in compliance with HCFA
regulations. The patient was under general anesthesia throughout
the procedure. No TEE related complications. The patient appears
to be in sinus rhythm. Results were personally reviewed with the
MD caring for the patient. See Conclusions for post-bypass data

Conclusions
PRE-BYPASS:
The left atrium is dilated. Left ventricular wall thickness,
cavity size and regional/global systolic function are normal
(LVEF >55%).
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
There are focal calcifications in the aortic arch. There are
simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is
mild aortic valve stenosis (valve area 1.8 cm2 by VTI and 2.3 by
planimetry). There is restricted m obility of the left coronary
cusp without much evidence of calcification
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral
regurgitation. Physiologic mitral regurgitation is seen (within
normal limits).
There is no pericardial effusion.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 914**] was notified in person of the results on [**Known lastname **]
before surgical incision

POST-BYPASS:
Preserved biventricualr systolic function. LVEF 55%.
Intact thoracic aorta.
Minimal MR, TR and AI.
  I certify that I was present for this procedure in compliance
with HCFA regulations.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr [**Known lastname **] was admitted and taken to the Operating Room for
Coronary bypass grafting x4:  Left internal mammary artery to
left anterior descending coronary; reverse saphenous vein single
graft from aorta to first obtuse marginal coronary artery;
reverse saphenous vein single graft from aorta to second obtuse
marginal coronary; as well as reverse saphenous vein single
graft from aorta to the distal right coronary artery. 2.
Endoscopic left greater saphenous vein harvesting. See opertaive
note for details. Post-operatively he was admitted to the ICu
intubated and sedated for invasive hemodynamic monitoring. he
awoke neurologically intact, was weaned form the ventilator and
extubated without difficulty. He was started on diuresis and
betablockade and his statin therapy was resumed. He was
transferred to the stepdown unit on POD#1. Chest tubes and
pacing wires were removed per protocol. He was evaluated by
physical therpay for strength and conditioning and was cleared
for discharge to home on POD#4 by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
