Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 898**]
Chief Complaint:
hypotension checked by VNA

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
Pt is a 49F w/ a h/o DM1 (c/b amputations), UC (on steroids
chronically) s/p CVA found by VNA to have a SBP of 80. Brought
to OSH and SBP was 66.  Previous to this had been discharged
from [**Hospital1 **] on [**7-23**] after being treated for a foot infection
following a TMA revision surgery of the left foot.  She went
home on PO cipro and PO linezolid.   She started feeling run
down on Monday [**7-25**] and sleeping more than usual.  She also
states she checked her temp and had a fever of 102.  In addition
she admits to feeling "groggy" in the a.m. and early afternoon
for past 6 months and blames it on polypharmacy.

No pressors were needed and BP responded to 4L fluid at OSH.

ROS: Patient had fever, possibly chills, but denied nausea,
vomiting, or abdominal pain.  She was eating well until last two
days. She denies chest pain. Single episode of SOB yesterday.
No edema, urinary sx. No HA/dizziness

Pertinent Results:
Lower Extremity Ultrasound: IMPRESSION: No evidence of DVT
bilaterally

[**7-28**] portable CXR: Left basilar opacity likely representing
pneumonia.  Follow-up chest radiograph should be performed to
ensure resolution.

[**7-29**] portable CXR: Increase caliber of the mediastinum is
probably due to progressive venous engorgement, accompanied by
lower lung volumes and probable increase in vascular congestion
and mild pulmonary edema, all point to cardiac decompensation.
Pleural effusion, if any, is small.  No pneumothorax.

portable abdomen [**7-28**]: No evidence of obstruction.

ECHO [**2135-8-1**]
Conclusions:
The left atrium is normal in size. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and
regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal.  The aortic valve
leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve appears
structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is
borderline pulmonary artery  systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2135-4-7**], no
resting LVOT  gradient is identified on the current study.

[**4-9**] ECHO
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity size  is normal. Left ventricular systolic
function is hyperdynamic (EF 70-80%).  Right ventricular chamber
size and free wall motion are normal. There is no pericardial
effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 49 year old female s/p recent TMA revision being treated
with antibiotics for lower extremity ulcer and then developed
hypotension and hyperglycemia, with a finding of LLL opacity on
CXR.

1.  Sepsis- The patient presented from the OSH with a picture of
Sepsis/SIRS.  Her blood cultures from [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) **] and [**Hospital1 18**] were
all negative for growth during her hospital admission.  A chest
xray performed showed a left lower lobe infiltrate which was
characterized later as most likely being atelectasis rather than
pneumonia.  When the patient was admitted, she had what looked
like a cellulitis of her left lower extremity.  She was started
on vancomycin and levofloxacin and given IV fluids.  She
responsed well to treatment and at discharge she was afebrile
with normal blood pressures.  She will continue with her course
of antiobiotcs on Linezolid PO and Levofloxacin PO for a
complete 14 day course of antibiotics. An echo performed during
her hospital admission did not reveal any signs of endocarditis.


2. Anemia- Patient's anemia is most consistent with anemia of
chronic disease based on her labwork (see labs).  She will
continue on her iron, folate, and vitamin 12 as she's been
doing.  Her HCT was in her baseline throughtout her hospital
admission.  She will followup with her PCP for her anemia.

3. ARF- The acute renal failure was likely due to her
hypotension and hypoperfusion.  She was given IV fluids at
admission with correction of both her hypotension and her
creatinine.  Prior to discharge, her creatinine was at her
baseline.

4. Hypoalbuminemia- This was likely due to her poor nutritional
state.  Nutrition saw the patient and gave her recommendations
on proper diet.

5. DM- On admission, the patients glucose was very high.  She
was started on an insulin drip, but was then converted to her
home insulin doses.  She was sent home on her Lantus and ISS
based on [**Last Name (un) **] recommendations.  She will follow with her PCP
regarding improvement in glucose control which will also help
with her foot infections.

6. Decreased Platelets- During the [**Hospital 228**] hospital admission,
she was noted to have a Plt count in the 300s in mid [**Month (only) **], but
prior to discharge she had dropped to the low 100s.  We sent
Heparin Dependent Antibodies since the patient was maintained on
heparin due to her inability to ambulate.  At discharge, the
results were still pending.  We have sent the patient home with
instructions to VNA nursing to draw a repeat platelet level 2
days after discharge and inform her PCP of the result.

Patient will be discharged home with VNA services.
