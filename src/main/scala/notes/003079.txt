HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 62-year-old
female with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease, coronary artery disease, mitral valve replacement
and was found to have a right upper lobe mass on chest x-ray
in [**2184-4-27**].  The patient had a follow-up chest CT scan
which confirmed the presence of a mass in the right upper
lobe and collapse of that lobe in [**2184-10-27**].
Approximately four weeks prior to admission the patient is
noted to have increased dyspnea on exertion and two weeks
prior to admission the patient presented to the emergency
department with dyspnea on exertion and lower extremity
edema.  However, at that time she left against medical
advise because she did not want to have a bronchoscopy or a
thoracentesis done.

The patient returned two weeks later on [**2-26**] with the
same symptoms of shortness of breath, dyspnea, exertion and
lower extremity edema.  She also states she had a chronic
cough and a 20 pound weight loss in the past year with one
episode of hemoptysis.  During the initial part of the
hospitalization the patient's Coumadin was discontinued.  She
had lower extremity ultrasounds which were negative for deep
vein thrombosis and chest x-ray showed right pleural effusion
and cardiomegaly.  When the patient's INR decreased she was
taken for a bronchoscopy which showed a pulsatile mass in the
right middle lobe.  A biopsy and washings were performed.
After the procedure the patient did well until approximately
90 minutes later when she went into acute respiratory
distress and respiratory failure.  She was intubated and
brought to the MICU for further care.  On arrival to the MICU
the patient was awake and appeared comfortable not in any
distress.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Right upper lobe mass; see History of Present Illness.
2.  Atrial fibrillation.
3.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
4.  Rheumatic heart disease with mitral valve replacement in
[**2167**].
5.  Coronary artery disease status post coronary artery
bypass graft.
6.  Pulmonary artery hypertension.
7.  Biatrial enlargement.
8.  Hyperlipidemia.
9.  Hypothyroidism.
10. History of hepatitis.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 35-pack-year tobacco smoker
who quit 12 years ago.  No alcohol or drug use.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission the patient was intubated
but following commands.  Vital signs; temperature 98.9 F,
pulse 78 to 81, blood pressure 89 to 97 over 36 to 69.  The
patient was having an oxygen saturation of 95 to 100% on
controlled ventilation.  Chest exam significant for decreased
breath sounds on the right with coarse breath sounds and
scattered rales anteriorly bilaterally.  Heart exam
significant for mechanical heart sounds.  Abdomen is benign.
Extremities show 1+ pitting edema bilaterally with no calf
tenderness.

LABORATORY ON ADMISSION TO MICU:  Complete blood count; white
blood cell count 9.8, hematocrit 20.6, platelet count
343,000.  Coags significant for an INR of 1.4.  Chemistry
significant for bicarbonate of 38, chloride of 91.  Calcium
was elevated at 11.6.  Chest x-ray showed complete
opacification of the right hemothorax and a large right
atrium.  Electrocardiogram showed atrial fibrillation at 80
to 85 beats per minute with right axis deviation and T-wave
inversions in leads 2, 3 and aVF with nonspecific ST changes.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  Right upper lobe mass.  Due to the size and nature of the
mass seen by x-ray and CT as well as bronchoscopy it most
likely represented a malignancy.  However, the biopsy
obtained during the bronchoscopy was not definitive.
Numerous sputum cytologies were sent which showed highly
atypical keratinized squamous cells highly suspicious for
non-small cell lung cancer.  The patient was offered more
definitive diagnostic modality such as a transthoracic CT
guided needle biopsy; however, she did decline due to the
likelihood that this was malignancy.  PTH related peptide was
also sent as the patient was hypercalcemic and this showed
that there was an elevated level of PTHrP which again made
lung cancer the most likely and very likely diagnosis.

Both oncology, radiation oncology and CT surgery were
consulted for recommendations on treatment options.
Radiation oncology felt that the mass was too large to
receive radiation for treatment, however the patient could
receive radiation for palliative reasons, perhaps to improve
compression on large airways which may improve her
respiratory function.  Therefore, the patient was taken for
two doses of radiation, however, this did not resolve the
insignificant improvement in any of her symptoms including
her respiratory function.  Neither the oncology service nor
the cardiac thoracic surgery service felt that there was any
definitive treatment that could be done to significantly
improve the patient's mortality.

2.  Respiratory failure.  The patient's respiratory failure
was thought to be secondary to the large right lung mass as
well as the copious amount of secretions that she was
producing possibly secondary to the lung mass and combination
of her underlying lung disease of chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease.  She was continued on mechanical
ventilation for her entire Intensive Care Unit stay until the
last day.  She was also given inhalers for bronchodilation
for her chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.  Numerous
attempts were made to wean the patient from the ventilator.
Finally, it was decided since the patient had a terminal
illness that the patient and the family both wanted to try
extubation and spontaneous breathing.  The patient was
therefore extubated per her wishes.  Initially she did well
but after approximately two hours the patient went into
respiratory arrest and passed away.  Prior to her extubation
it was decided that were the patient go into respiratory
arrest she would not be reintubated or resuscitated.

3.  Cardiovascular.  The patient had a rate that appeared to
be junctional while she was in the Intensive Care Unit.  She
was initiated on digoxin; however, was taken off of this and
her rate was well controlled.  She did not require any other
nodal agents for rate control.  The patient was maintained on
anticoagulation for an artifical valve.

Shortly after extubation the patient was found to be
asystolic on Telemetry monitor.  She passed away at 1:44 p.m.
on [**2185-3-17**].

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Lung cancer.
2.  Intermittent atrial fibrillation.
3.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
4.  Hypercalcemia malignancy.
5.  Coronary artery disease.

Postmortem examination was declined by the family.
