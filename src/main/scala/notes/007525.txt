Pertinent Results:
[**2-2**] Chest CT
IMPRESSION:
1. There is evidence of increase in size in the left infrahilar
mass which
occludes the lingular bronchus, though it is difficult to tell
the precise
borders of the lesion and size of the lesion given the
non-contrast technique.
There is also new collapse of the left lower lobe, though the
airway remains
narrowed but patent, as evidenced by air bronchograms throughout
the left
lower lobe. Patchy nodular opacities elsewhere within the left
upper lobe and
within the right lung are also new, possibly infectious or
disease related.
2. Slight increase in left pleural effusion, new trace right
pleural effusion
and mild increase in pericardial effusion. Trace free pelvic
fluid.
3. Bulkiness of the left adrenal, unchanged, without a focal
lesion noted.
4. Hypodense area within the anterior liver as described, not
fully
characterized using non-contrast CT technique. If indicated,
this could be
further evaluated with ultrasound for the presence of a focal
lesion.
5. Calcified lesion of the interpolar left kidney, not fully
characterized.
6. Sigmoid diverticulosis, without evidence of diverticulitis.
7. Compression fractures of T8 (treated with vertebroplasty) and
T12.
8. Mild interval increase in size of subcentimeter mediastinal
lymph nodes, nonspecific.

[**2-6**] MR [**Name13 (STitle) 430**]
IMPRESSION: 1. Abnormal focus of enhancement is identified in
the left frontal lobe subcortical white matter as described in
detail above.

2. Punctate areas of restricted diffusion are also noted in both
cerebral
hemispheres in the convexity, possibly consistent with
metastatic foci, versus thromboembolic ischemic changes versus
septic emboli.

3. Chronic microvascular ischemic changes identified in the
subcortical white matter. Obliteration of the paranasal sinuses
with fluid levels within the maxillary sinuses bilaterally and
significant mucosal thickening involving the frontal, ethmoidal
and sphenoid sinus, bilateral opacities in the mastoid air
cells.

Brief Hospital Course:
82 year old woman with newly diagnosed sqamous cell lung cancer,
presenting with respiratory distress in setting of post
obstructive pneumonia.
.
#. Acute Hypoxic Respiratory Distress:  Patient is s/p trach
placement as she was ventilator dependent.  Patient's condition
was multifactorial given lung cancer, prior emphysema requiring
oxygen and development of post obstructive pneumonia.  Patient
had bronchoscopy on [**2-2**] that showed lots of pus (consistent
with pneumonia) and external compression of airways.  Patient
was intubated and was tough to completely wean off the
ventilator.  Patient had tracheostomy placed on [**2-16**] and has been
intermittantly ventilator dependent.  Patient has been able to
tolerate trach mask for increasing duration during end of
hospitalization, however has not been able to be off for full 24
hours and has been intermittantly pressure support dependent.
Patient has also been treated with course of methylprednisonlone
and has been completely weaned off.
- Continue trach mask as tolerated, goal > 24 hours
- Continue Atrovent / Albuterol nebs as needed
- Continue mouth rinse

# Post Obstructive Pneumonia:  In the setting of new diagnosed
lung mass, patient developed LLL pneumonia and was treated with
Ceftriaxone, Levofloxacin, Flagyl for a total 14 day course.
Patient has remained afebrile and has been maintaining
saturations on trach mask.  Ultimately, patient will need her
lung mass addressed as she is prone to obstructive process in
the future.
- Monitor patient for signs and symptoms of infection
.
# Left squamous cell lung cancer:  Per CT report, it has
increased in size comapared to [**12-6**] comparison and it
completely obstructs the lingular bronchus.  Patient was
evaluated by Radiation oncology and recieved a short course of
radiation.  Patient was also followed by the Heme/Onc service
and recommended possible chemotherapy as an outpatient once
patient continues to be stable.
- Patient to follow up as an outpatient with
Hematology/Oncology.  Patient/family should be contact[**Name (NI) **] by
Heme/Onc -- if not contact[**Name (NI) **] in 1 week, please call ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 11624**].
.
# Nurtrition:  Patient had PEG placed on [**2-16**] and was receiving
tube feeds during her hospitalization.
- Continue Nutren tube feeds
