Brief Hospital Course:
72yo F with ESRD on HD, HTN now presents with unresponsiveness,
headache and agitation in the setting of leukocytosis, lung
infiltrate.
1) Altered mental status: DDx initially included toxic
metabolic, stroke, meningitis, encephalitis, non-convulsive
seizures, central venous thrombophlebitis, traumatic brain
injury. Unremarkable head CT and MRI without evidence of CVA.
Patient presented with hyperkalemia (possibly consistent with
toxic-metabolic etiology), leukocytosis and pulmonary infiltrate
(pointing to possible infectious etiology).  Patient was
intubated for airway protection and admitted to the ICU, in the
setting of agitation.  She was extubated the following day with
evidence of improved mental status and was transferred out of
the ICU.  Following extubation, she was evaluated and followed
by Neurology Consult and felt to be at cognitive baseline, with
no indication for further intervention.  Her hyperkalemia was
treated with urgent HD.  Given the leukocytosis, left-shift and
left lung infiltrate, she was also treated empirically for
community-acquired pneumonia; however, repeat CXR revealed this
infiltrate to be consistent with unilateral pulmonary edema
after diuresis, and antibiotic course was limited to 7 days of
levofloxacin.
.
2) Hyponatremia: likely hypovolemic given hemoconcentration,
worsening Cr and clinically does not appear volume overloaded.
Resolved with gentle fluid.
.
3) ESRD: on HD T, Th, Sat. Patient does not appear clinically
volume overloaded, however, hyperkalemic with peaked Ts on
admission and unilateral pulmonary edema.  Hypervolemia &
hyperkalemia resolved with urgent HD.  Continued sevelemer and
calcium.
.
4) Hypertension: continue on Bumetanide, Lisinopril, Isosorbide,
Norvasc and Metoprolol 75 mg [**Hospital1 **].
.
5) Hypothyroid: continue on Synthroid.
.
6) Diabetes: Insulin SSI.  Oral medications resumed at
[**Hospital1 **].

[**Location (un) **] Instructions:
You were found with altered mental status at home, and you were
briefly intubated in the ICU to protect your airway.  CT and MRI
of your brain were both negative for any evidence of a stroke.
Your potassium level was very high on admission, and this
resolved with urgent dialysis.  After you were extubated, your
mental status was back to normal.  You were evaluated by the
Neurology service who recommended no further intervention.

Take all medications as instructed.
