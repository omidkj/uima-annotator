Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3984**]
Chief Complaint:
Failure to thrive

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
This is a 44 year old F with HIV (last CD4 count of 181 in
[**2192-1-18**] recently started on HAART), severe pulmonary hypertension
on 4 L home O2, likely anti-phospholipid syndrome on
anticoagulation with recent supratherapeutic INR, who presents
with poor po intake, lethargy, hypoxia, and mental status
changes. She was transferred from [**Hospital6 33**] ED to
[**Hospital1 18**] ED for managment of hypoxia. Her PCP, [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name11 (NameIs) **], received
a call from the pts daughter, [**Name (NI) 13788**], telling him that the
patient is essentially failing to thrive. She was described as
listless, no appetite with poor po intake, minimally
interactive, fighting medications, and sleeping alot. The family
has had difficulty trying to keep the pts oxygen on. She has
only been drinking a can or two of boost a day and minimal
fluids.
.
The patient was hospitalized last month and had a complicated
course. She was febrile and hypoxic at home. On admission,
progressive centrilobular nodular densities were noted on chest
imaging studies. There was concern for an infectious process;
BAL fluid demonstrated growth of both Moraxella and
Pneumococcus. A course of antibiotics was administered, and the
patient's fever and hypoxia resolved. Although there was concern
for other pulmonary infectious possibilities, including
Cryptococcus, Legionella, and Mycobacterial infection
(tuberculous or atypical), no evidence of any of these entities
was found on culture. She also had a L thalamic infarct thought
to be due to probable diagnosis of antiphospholipid antibody
syndrome. She was started on coumadin. She also developed a R
wrist drop thought to be due to plexopathy. This issue resolved.

.
In the ED, the pts vitals were: Tm 103.4, BP 80-114/40-84, HR
104-130, Sat 96-100%NRB. She was initially found to be satting
91% on 100% NRB with ABG of: 7.41/24/63. She was given
Levofloxacin 500 mg IV x1, Ceftriaxone 1 gm IV x1, and Vancmycin
1 gm IV x1. Upon presentation to the ED, the patient had a temp
of 103, SBPs in the 70-80s. She was started on a peripheral
levophed gtt. Attempt was made at placing an IJ, however her
internal carotid was punctured. She was found to have a 2x2 cm
hematoma around the R internal carotid and 3X5 cm hematoma
extending into the mediastinum. INR was >5. Patient received 5mg
of vitK sc and FFP. Vascular surgery was consulted. Repeat CT
chest showed no active carotid bleed. For her electrolyte
abnormalities she also received Neutraphos 2 packets, 2 amps of
Calcium gluconate, 2 gm IV magnesium sulfate. She received 7L NS
for resusitation.
.
The pt states that she has felt very fatigued recently, and
notes occasional subjective fevers. She has an occasional
nonproductive cough. She describes nausea but no vomiting over
the past several days. She denies HA, diarrhea, constipation,
abdominal pain, dysuria, chest pain, sore throat, rhinorrhea, or
feeling SOB. She has not been taking her atovaquone or
azithromycin prophylaxis as she states pharmacy was having
difficulty filling these prescriptions for her.

FINDINGS: A large hematoma tracking along the right carotid
sheath and extending into the anterior mediastinum is likely
iatrogenic, related to the several recent right subclavian
central line placement attempts. Within the neck, the hematoma
measures 2.7 x 2.6 cm in maximal axial dimension. In the
anterior mediastinum, the hematoma measures up to 4.4 x 2.7 cm.
On the contrast-enhanced images, there is a 4-mm rounded
hyperdensity isointense to the adjacent right subclavian artery
(3:16), new since the previous study, in context concerning for
possible pseudoaneurysm or, less likely, active extravasation.
The imaged airway is widely patent. No filling defects are seen
within the pulmonary arterial vasculature to indicate pulmonary
embolus. The thoracic aorta is normal in caliber without
evidence for dissection. The main pulmonary artery measures up
to 2.5 cm consistent with history of pulmonary hypertension.
Multiple borderline enlarged paratracheal and subcarinal lymph
nodes are likely reactive. There is no axillary lymphadenopathy.
The lungs demonstrate dense consolidation of the posterior basal
segment of the right upper lobe with associated air
bronchograms. Moderate emphysema with subpleural blebs appears
similar when compared to the previous study of [**2
