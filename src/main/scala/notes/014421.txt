History of Present Illness:
61-year-old woman, with celiac disease and Barrett's esophagus,
who is on a surveillance program. Her Barrett's has progressed
to high-grade dysplasia
confirmed on pathologic review. We discussed a variety of
interventions for this as well as the risk that this could
represent the presence of invasive cancer somewhere in the
[**Doctor Last Name 15532**] segment. She elected to proceed with resection, and I
recommended a transhiatal approach to which she consented.
