History of Present Illness:
74M history of AVR, pacer, afib, iddm s/p appy [**3-24**] c/b
intraperitoneal bleed, MRSA(was on linezolid) pna c/b loculated
right parapneumonic effusion requiring chest tube, thoracostomy
and VATS decortication procedure, VAP, TBM and eventually
trach/PEG. He has been at [**Hospital 100**] Rehab since [**4-30**]. Trach removed
last week. He was feeling better until yesterday when he started
getting more SOB and required trach replacement and started on
vancomycin. On day of presentation, he got agitated and pulled
out trach at 3AM witnseed by RT, went unresponsive and
diaphoretic. A respiratory code was called, trach replaced and
ambu bagged until arousable.

At [**Hospital1 18**] ED, his initial VS were T:99 P:56 BP:135/44; R24: 98%
on TM. EKG is V paced. CXR show LLL PNA. He was given
ceftazidime in the ED. He was agitated, given ativan and
restrained. Surgery was made aware of trach.

Patient is somnolent on admission and not able to provide any
additional history.

Radiology:
CXR AP [**2190-5-22**]-Percutaneous gastrostomy tube tip overlies the
left mid abdomen just below the left twelve posterior rib.
Without contrast injection, it is not possible to determine
whether this is within the bowel or extraluminal. Nonobstructive
bowel gas pattern is visualized. Diffuse skeletal abnormalities
related to previous vertebroplasty procedures are noted.

CXR AP [**2190-5-22**]- Tracheostomy tube is now positioned vertically in
the trachea. Bibasilar consolidation which developed between [**5-20**] and [**5-22**] has increased. On the left this is quite likely
pneumonia, on the right pneumonia and/or atelectasis. Small
right pleural effusion is stable. No pneumomediastinum or
pneumothorax. Transvenous right atrial and right ventricular
pacer leads are in positions essentially unchanged since [**Month (only) 958**],
including an atrial line which loops close to the tricuspid
valve before returning to position likely in the right atrium.
G/GJ TUBE CHECK PORT-[**2190-5-23**]-
IMPRESSION: Placement of PEG tube with tip placement confirmed
by injection of Gastrografin by resident in ICU.

[**2190-5-23**] CXR-Tracheostomy tube and permanent pacemaker remain in
standard position. Bilateral perihilar and basilar lung
opacities are again demonstrated with very minimal improved
aeration on the left manifested by improved visualization of the
left hemidiaphragm and slight worsening on the right. Bilateral
pleural effusions, right greater than left, are unchanged.

Brief Hospital Course:
Impression: Pt is a 74 male hx AVR, pacer, afib, iddm s/p appy
[**3-24**] c/b intraperitoneal bleed, MRSA(was on linezolid) pna/VAP
c/b loculated right parapneumonic effusion requiring chest tube,
thoracostomy and VATS decortication, TBM, now chronically
trach/PEG, [**Last Name (un) 4662**] into ED after self decannulated in nursing
home

1. Respiratory distress:
-likely LLL PNA seen on CXR, lactate 2.1, and leukocytosis on
admission. He was initially placed on vancomycin (history of
MRSA PNA), levaquin, and flagyl and the flagyl was d/cd. On
discharge day, we changed his antibiotics to doxycycline and
flagyl and d/cd the levaquin as QTc ~510 and this would provide
adequate coverage for aspiration and communication acquired
pneumonia.
-In terms of his trach, initially it was at a 45 degree angle on
CXR. Subsequent repositioning of it on repeat CXR it is in the
proper location.
-The patient was ventilated on AC which was changed to pressure
support. He should continue on this with a wean when able.
-Blood culture, sputum cultures do not show any growth.

2. Wound infection- wound infection from right upper back is a
hematoma from VATs/decortication surgery. He had a hematoma
drained by thoracic surgery on [**2190-5-20**]. Wound culture is growing
MRSA. He will continue vancomycin for a 14 day course. Gets [**Hospital1 **]
wound packing to it and has follow up with thoracic surgery
