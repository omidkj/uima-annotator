Ddimer.  Patient was given vanc, levoflox, cefepime, methylpred
125, zofran, and duonebs, and sent to the ICU for further

Brief Hospital Course:
IMPRESSION : 72-year-old gentleman with PMH significant for
severe COPD (Gold stage III with prior intubations), prostate CA
(on chemical castration therapy), and diastolic CHF who was
admitted with acute respiratory distress presumed to be from an
acute COPD exacerbation with component of acute diastolic
dysfunction. Patient also noted to have hyponatremia and RLE
cellulitis. His oxygenation slowly improved with treatment of
acute COPD exacerbation (prednisone, azithromycin and standing
nebs) and also with gentle diuresis. Patient also had delirium
throughout his hospital stay, treated with intermittent haldol
and then with his home dose of risperdal at night.

# ACUTE RESPIRATORY DISTRESS: Patient presented with acute
hypoxemic respiratory failure, w
