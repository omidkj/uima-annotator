History of Present Illness:
 Mrs. [**Known lastname 1968**] is a lady nearing her 70s who
was referred by the spine surgeons at [**Hospital6 1322**].  She is scheduled to have a significant
stabilization procedure of her cervical spine which had been
radiated much earlier in life.  A [**Last Name 16423**] problem was the poor
quality of the skin and the tight character of the skin.
With the expected internal fixation needed, there was great
concern about the closure of this wound.  The consultants at
[**Hospital1 **] felt that she really would not have sufficient skin
for a good closure and for this reason she is referred to our
microvascular center for a free tissue transfer to add tissue
prior to the cervical stabilization procedure by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 82640**].
