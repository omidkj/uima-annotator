Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 425**]
Chief Complaint:
s/p cardiac arrest

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
cardiac catheterization
right internal jugular central venous catheterization
intraaortic balloon pump placement
Arctic Sun cooling protocol

History of Present Illness:
81 yo M with CAD s/p CABG in [**2110**], ischemic cardiomyopathy EF
40-45%, Afib on Coumadin, HTN, MR, TR, bifascicular block
transferred from [**Location (un) 620**] s/p Vtach/Vfib arrest.
.
The patient presented to [**Hospital1 18**] [**Location (un) 620**] for exercise stress
testing with nuclear imaging. EKGs from [**Hospital1 18**] [**Location (un) 620**] document a
narrow complex rhythm with rate 89 at 9:52 a.m. Between 9:53 and
9:56 a.m., there was a narrow complex tachycardia with rate
110-[**Street Address(2) 86618**] depressions in V2-V5. At 9:56:56 a.m., there
was monomorphic VT. At 9:58:28, there was ventricular
fibrillation.
.
The cardiopulmonary arrest record documents resusciation
beginning at 10:13 a.m., with the initial rhythm being Vfib.
During the resuscitation, the patient received 6 shocks at 360
joules, plus amiodarone 300 mg x 4, atropine 1 mg x 2,
epinephrine 1 mg x 3, and sodium bicarb x 1. The patient was
intubated. After return of spontaneous circulation, the patient
was started on a norepinephrine infusion and transported to the
cardiac catheterization lab at [**Hospital1 18**].
.
Cardiac catheterization revealed a right-dominant circulation
with extensive disease of the native vessels. SVG-LAD patent,
SVG-PDA 40% occluded, SVG-OM occluded, LIMA-LAD atretic.
.
On arrival, the patient was intubated and sedated. Review of
systems could not be obtained.

Cardiac catheterization [**2132-2-13**]:
1. Coronary angiography of this right dominant system
demonstrated 3 vessel native coronary artery disease.  The LAD
had a 100% occlusion of the mid segment.  The distal LAD filled
from a SVG.  The LCX had a 100% occlusion of the mid segment.
The distal LCX filled from right to left collaterals.  The RCA
had a 60% mid stenosis and 100% occlusion in the distal segment.

2. Arterial graft angiography showed a very atretic
LIMA-Diagonal.
3. Venous graft angiography showed a patent SVG-LAD, occluded
SVG-OM, and patent SVG-RPDA that had a 40% mid graft stenosis.
4. Resting hemodynamics revealed elevated right and left sided
filling pressures with a RVEDP of 26 mmHg and a mean PCWP of 28
mmHg.  There was moderate pulmonary arterial hypertension with a
PA pressure of 49/27 mmHg.  Central aortic pressure was 103/70
mmHg on norepinephrine.  The cardiac index was low at 1.3
L/min/m2.
5. A Fiberoptix intra-aortic balloon pump was inserted from the
left common femoral artery.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Patent SVG-LAD and SVG-RPDA.
3. Atretic LIMA-Diagonal
4. Occluded SVG-OM.
5. Cardiogenic shock.
6. Moderate pulmonary hypertension.
7. Elevated biventricular filling pressures.
.
CXR (portable AP) [**2132-2-13**]: ET tube tip is in standard position
4.9 cm above the carina. NG tube tip is in the stomach, the side
port is just at the level of the GE junction. Right IJ catheter
tip is in the lower SVC. Swan-Ganz catheter tip is in the
pulmonary outflow tract. IABP tip 2.9 cm below the top of the
aortic arch. There is moderate cardiomegaly. There is no
pneumothorax, pleural effusion or pulmonary edema. Sternal wires
are aligned. Patient is status post CABG. Ill-defined opacity
inferiorly to the right hilum could be atelectasis. Aspiration
is another consideration.
.
Echo (transthoracic) [**2132-2-14**]: The left atrium is moderately
dilated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity is mildly dilated. There is mild regional
left ventricular systolic dysfunction with thinning and akinesis
of the basal inferior wall and inferolateral wall and
hypokinesis of the basal to mid inferior septum and mid inferior
and inferolateral segments. The right ventricular cavity is
dilated with depressed free wall contractility. The aortic valve
leaflets are moderately thickened. There is no aortic valve
stenosis. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The estimated
pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. The pulmonic valve
leaflets are thickened. There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Focal LV systolic dysfunction consistent with prior
inferior MI. Moderate mitral and mild aortic regurgitation. The
right ventricle is not well seen but is probably
dilated/hypokinetic.
.
CXR PA and lateral [**2132-2-19**]:  In comparison with the study of
[**2-18**], there is no interval change.  ICD implant remains in place
with the tip in the region of the apex of the right ventricle.
No evidence of pneumothorax. No vascular congestion, pleural
effusion, or acute focal pneumonia.

Brief Hospital Course:
81 yo M with CAD s/p CABG ischemic cardiomyopathy EF 40-45%,
Afib on Coumadin, HTN, MR, TR, bifascicular block transferred
from [**Location (un) 620**] s/p Vtach/Vfib arrest.
.
# s/p cardiac arrest: The patient was transferred from [**Hospital1 18**]
[**Location (un) 620**] after resuscitation from Vtach/Vfib arrest. On arrival
to [**Hospital1 18**] [**Location (un) 86**], he was taken directly to the cardiac
catheterization lab, where an intraaortic balloon pump was
placed. The patient was then transferred to the CCU, and the
Arctic Sun cooling protolol was initiated. After 24 hours of
cooling to 34 degrees, the patient was warmed. After warming,
the patient's mental status gradually improved until he was
alert, fully oriented, and able to converse appropriately.
Continuous EEG revealed no evidence of epi
