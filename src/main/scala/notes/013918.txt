History of Present Illness:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 6314**] is a 70 yo female with MMP, including CHF with EF
30-35%,including PEG tube for achalasia & esophagitis,
osteoporosis c/b compression fractures, and pituitary adenoma
s/p radiation (last treatment [**2161-5-26**]) who presented from rehab

Brief Hospital Course:
70 yo female with CAD, CHF, achalasia w/ PEG tube, pituitary
adenoma s/p recent XRT, s/p klebsiella and steotrophomonas UTI
and GPC bacteremia, flash pulmonary edema, probable ACS event,
and L facial droop c/w ischemic stroke.
.
On the wards, pt found to have UTI (though UA notable only for
[**3-16**] RBC & postive nitrites, only 0-2WBC). Urine cx grew
pansensitive Klebsiella & Stenotrophomonas sensitive to Bactrim.
She was tx'd w/ levo. Her SBP trended down from 90s-110s to 80s
which was initially responsive to IVF and then unresponsive. She
received >3.3L IVF in 24 hours (was 2.5L (+)). She had low grade
fevers ~99.8 and was reportedly more tired appearing, "less
perky" but was without complaints. Abx broadened to ceftaz &
vanc. Given concern for potential early urosepsis patient was
transferred to the MICU for further management on [**2161-6-12**].
In the MICU, blood cultures from [**6-12**] grew out pansensitive
enterococcus as did her PICC tip. Source of her bacteremia
unclear.   She was continued on vanco, ceftaz, and flagyl (?
aspiration on CTA chest) as well as Bactrim for
stenotrophomonas. She had intermittent hypoxia thought to be due
to CHF and pulm edema which was responsive to prn lasix. Also
received short course of CPAP. Also intermittent hypotension
responsive to IVF and holding of BP meds. Ddx sepsis vs.
cardiogenic shock. On [**6-14**], patient had an episode of increased
RR, increased O2 requirement, hypertensive requiring NTG gtt,
lasix, lopressor, and morphine. EKG showed new TWI in inferior
and precordial leads. CEs showed elevation w/ TnT peak of 0.15
(on [**6-15**], and [**6-16**]) as well as CK peak of 204 ([**6-14**]) and MB of
17 ([**6-14**]). Treated with asa/plavix, heparin given h/o GI bleeding
and Hct drop. Received 1 unit PRBCs on [**6-15**] for Hct 21 w/ guiaic
positive stools. At approximately the same time, patient
developed a new L facial droop. Cardiology was consulted for
NSTEMI and recommended medical management.  Repeat TTE showd
worsening LVEF .  Neuro was consulted for L facial droop.  CT
head was negative for bleed. Carotid u/s negative for stenosis.
MRI has not yet been obtained.  Neuro attributed to toxic
metabolic derangements vs. watershed infarct but no further
intervention entertained. Most recently, has had intermittent
sinus tachycardia. Today [**6-17**], received 20 mg IV lasix w/ brisk
diuresis leading to tachycardia to 120s (baseline has been
90s-100s) which resolved back to baseline w/ 250 cc NS. Also
attempted to increase beta blocker but systolic BPs dropped to
90s which returned to the 100s with IVF.  Back pain has also
[**Last Name 19301**] problem throughout admission on multiple pain medications
and lidocaine patch.
Currently, patient w/o complaint. Denies back pain, chest pain,
SOB, abdominal pain, N/V, diarrhea.  Breathing comfortably.
.
# Hypotension: baseline SBPs have been in 80s-100s. Pt's MS
reportedly at baseline right now. DDx includes sepsis,
cardiogenic hypotension. More likely cardiogenic given severely
depressed EF.  Patient currently afebrile with fluctuating but
currently improving Completed 7 day course of ceftaz/bactrim for
UTI. Hct stable following PRBC transfusion so less likely
bleeding. Also unlikely adrenal insufficiency given random [**Last Name (un) 104**]
of 21 ([**6-9**]).  She was continued on antibiotics for her
enterococcus bacteremia.  She was started on low dose captopril,
3.125 mg QID which was decreased to TID due to more frequent low
BPs in the 80s.  However, she tolerated the TID dosing with BPs
