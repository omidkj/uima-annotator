History of Present Illness:
51 year-old Russian speaking F transferred from [**Hospital1 **] Needman with
concerns of GI bleed and new PE. She was admitted on [**2192-4-7**] to
OSH after 1 week of daily rectal bleeding with each bowel

rectum as well. She gradually started experiencing dizziness but
denies syncope. Symptoms also associated with left sided chest
pressure, palpitations, and mild pleuritic chest pressure not
worse with bleeding. Of note, patient had a left ankle in cast
from recent ankle fracture in late [**Month (only) 956**]. She has been less
mobile as a result. Also, she flew here from [**Location (un) 3156**] in early
[**Month (only) 956**]. She denies a previous history of bleeding or clotting.


AT OSH, she was found to have a hematocrit of 14.8 and received
7 units PRBCs for GIB. An EGD showed mild gastritis without
active bleeding and a colonoscopy was normal. A CT chest showed
PE. CT abd/pelvis was normal except for large fibroid. An echo
was also within normal limits.

Upon arrival to ICU, the patient was feeling fatigued and
endorsed left sided chest pressure. She described the chest
pressure as a burning, [**5-8**] pain, that was worse with breathing.
Denied dizziness, fever/chills, abd pain, vaginal bleeding,
rectal bleeding but endorsed some mild nausea.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 89278**] presented with profound anemia and an acute pulmonary
embolus after recovering from a recent ankle fracture. On
presented to [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] and to [**Hospital1 18**] it was a bit unclear why
she was so anemic. However, on review of her history and lab
studies she had evidence of chronic blood loss anemia worse over
the few days prior to presentation. Upper, lower, and capsule
endoscopies revealed no source of bleeding other than internal
hemorrhoids. The best estimate at her presentation included
worsening constipation/hemorrhoids and a DVT/PE while recovering
from her recent ankle fracture. Fortunately, she improved with
treatments for each of these conditions and is being discharged
to follow-up with her new PCP, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on [**4-20**]. Management of
specific medical problems outlined below:

1. Acute pulmonary embolism:
 - thought to be provoked from immobility with cast on left leg
and recent plane flight from [**Location (un) 3156**].
 - given the bleeding and anticoagulation a retrievable IVC
filter (OptEase IVC filter) was placed on admission. As outlined
below, she will probably do well on anticoagulation but the
filter was left in place while this is being determined. If she
does not have any complications on anticoagulation this should
be removed. This can be arranged by calling [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 6745**] in the
Radiology Care Unit at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 6747**].
 - despite profound anemia on presentation she was treated with
many days of anticoagulation while hospitalized and had no drop
in her hematocrit. She was discharged on Lovenox and warfarin
and should have a 3 month warfarin course for a provoked DVT/PE.
She was started on warfarin 5mg on [**4-17**], 5mg on [**4-18**], and will
see Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on [**4-20**] for repeat check. Her last INR was 1.1 on
[**4-18**].

2. Chronic blood loss anemia
 - thought to be from a slow bleed internal hemorrhoids
 - she was advised to take water, fiber, and stool softeners as
needed to avoid constipation. If the hemorrhoids continue to
bleed she may need referral to a surgeon for consideration of
banding or surgery.

3. Ankle fracture
 - cast removed while hospitalized and placed in a walking boot.
She will follow-up with the Orthopedic Surgery Team on [**5-10**].
Contact information: [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) 2191**] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 2192**], NP. Phone:
[**Telephone/Fax (1) 1228**].

4. Breast lymph node
 - at [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] she was noted to have an abnormal left breast
lymph node on her CT angiogram (description under the results
section of this discharge summary). She should have routine
mammogram with mention of the lymph node while ordering as she
may need a breast ultrasound.

TRANSITION ISSUES:
 - check hematocrit and INR at 4/22 visit
 - arrange for evaluation of breast lymph node at 4/22 visit
