Allergies:
XIBROM

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2836**]
Chief Complaint:
Tachycardia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2117-3-3**]: Technically successful CT-guided drain upsizing with a
10-French biliary drain inserted into the right-sided peritoneal
collection.
[**2117-3-5**]: IVC filter placement
[**2117-3-11**]: Successful upsizing x 2 two and placement of a third
percutaneous drainage.


History of Present Illness:
69M hx necrotizing hemorrhagic pancreatitis c/b abd compartment
syndrome requiring decompressive laparotomy, MOSF, cardiac
arrest, intraabdominal abscesses and hemorrhage requiring
re-exploration, multiple washouts, and ultimately drain
placement, prolonged intubation and tracheostomy at [**Hospital1 498**] and
subsequent IR drainage at [**Hospital1 18**] presents from [**Hospital 100**] Rehab with
sudden onset sustained tachycardia and pleuritic chest pain
x24hrs.
Per rehab records and patient's son, the patient has been doing
well at rehab with the exception of persistent watery stool
until today when, per report, pt noted to have new onset
tachycardia to 120-130 with intermittent chest discomfort
without radiation. No antecedent or precipitating factors
reported. Per conversation with [**Hospital 100**] Rehab Staff ([**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] RN) and their review of facility [**Month (only) 16**], it seems pt was
refusing SCD/ambulation, but confirms receiving HSQ 5000unit
TID. Denies associated dyspnea, SOB, orthopnea, hemoptysis,
cough, fevers, or chills.
Pt is tolerating PO intake which is supplemented by cycled
Vivonex tube feeds via GJT. His bilateral flank drains continue
to drain light tan purulent appearing fluid.  Persistent
diarrhea with 5-7 loose watery stools overnight while on tube
feeds and [**2-12**] watery stools during the day. Per rehab records,
pt was empirically started on PO Vancomycin [**2-24**] for empiric
coverage for C.Diff.  No culture data available at time of
consultation.
Last seen in clinic [**2-26**] where note is made of persistent
diarrhea and initiation of empiric antibiotics for concern of
C.Diff with ID follow-up.  At that time, HR recorded as 105 with
SaO2 100% rm air.
At time of consultation, pt is afebrile with sustained sinus
tachycardia 120-130, otherwise hemodynamically appropriate with
SaO2 97% rm air. Lung fields clear to auscultation with clear
and equal breath sounds at bilateral bases.  Abdomen is soft
without rebound or guarding, GJT in place, bilateral flank
drains secured. Pt comfortable and conversant, and otherwise
nontoxic appearing.

[**2117-3-2**] CTA torso:
IMPRESSION:
1. Large bilateral pulmonary emboli without CT evidence of right
heart strain. Right base opacity grossly stable compared to
prior, most likely atelectasis, however early underlying infarct
is difficult to exclude. Apparent filling defects in the
bilateral common femoral veins which could reflect thrombus.
Ultrasound could be considered for further characterization if
clinically indicated. 2. Unchanged moderate nonhemorrhagic
pleural effusion and bibasilar atelectasis. 3. Slight decrease
in the size of the left posterior intra-abdominal fluid
collection. All other collections appear grossly unchanged
compared to prior and continue to be concerning for abscesses.
Percutaneous pigtail drains appear in standard position. 4.
Stable enhancement of the pancreatic parenchyma without new
areas of necrosis. Patent splenic artery and vein centrally.  5.
Moderate mesenteric and subcutaneous edema. 6. Unchanged mild
right hydroureteronephrosis with gradual tapering at the
level of the mid ureter secondary to extrinsic compression from
adjacent fluid collections.
.
[**2117-3-4**]: BLE US - Significant nonocclusive deep vein thrombosis
seen bilaterally in the femoral veins. Clot at the left common
femoral vein is large and is soft, appearing to be partially
mobile.
.
[**2117-3-5**] ECHO:
Conclusions
The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal
cavity size and global systolic function (LVEF>55%). The
estimated cardiac index is high (>4.0L/min/m2). Right
ventricular chamber size is normal with normal free wall
contractility. There is abnormal septal motion/position possibly
consistent with increased right ventricular pressure. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation. The
mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
