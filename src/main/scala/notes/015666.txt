Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3948**]
Chief Complaint:
Cough s/p bronchoscopy

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2169-11-24**] : Rigid bronchoscopy with black Dumon bronchoscope.
Cryotherapy for debridement of granulation tissue, distal left
main-stem. Balloon dilatation to 10 mm, distal left main-stem.
Mechanical debridement of granulation tissue, left main-stem.
[**2169-11-24**]: Flexible bronchoscopy
[**2169-11-23**]: Rigid bronchoscopy. Foreign body removal (Y-stent).


History of Present Illness:
64F with PMH of morbid obesity, OSA, severe COPD, and TBM s/p
placement of Y-stent on [**2169-11-6**], who presented today for
scheduled removal of her Y-stent. She states that since having
the stent in place she has suffered from increased shortness of
breath and coughing, with increased sputum and mucus production.
The procedure itself was uncomplicated, but in the PACU she had
nearly 2 hours of prolonged coughing which developed into
pleuritic CP. She received albuterol nebs, lidocaine nebs, IV
codeine, and 125mg IV solumedrol. A CXR revealed diffuse left
lung collapse from mucus plugging and probable aspiration. She
was placed on CPAP in the PACU with some improvement in
respiratory stauts. ABG was 7.41/47/65/31. EKG was not
concerning for ischemia. Cardiac enzymes were negative. The
decision was made to to perform bronchoscopy at that time, but
to admit to MICU for repsiraotry monitoring and possible bronch
in AM if plug had not cleared by then.
.
Currently she endorses shortness of breath above her baseline.
She has diffuse pleuritic chest pain that is non-radiating. She
occasionally has spasms of uncontrollable coughing.


Past Medical History:
1. Obesity.
2. History of pericarditis/tamponade secondary to polyserositis.

7. Asthma.
8. Hiatal hernia.
9. OSA on nocturnal CPAP (plus 12)
10. Hypertension.
11. Lactose intolerance.
12. Tracheobronchomalacia


Social History:
The patient is divorced. She lives alone in [**Location (un) **],
[**State 350**]. She has one son who lives close by. She has been
on disability since [**2149**]. Prior to that, she worked as a

years. She has never used any illicit drugs. She denies asbestos
exposure and reports no known TB exposures. She had a negative
PPD test last year prior to starting Enbrel therapy.

mother died secondary to rectal cancer 82 years old. Notably she
did have lupus. Her father died secondary to an MI at 72 years
old. Her son is healthy.

CXR:
[**2169-11-24**]  In comparison with study of [**11-23**], there has been
substantial
re-expansion of the left lung, presumably from expectoration of
a mucus plug.  Atelectatic changes persist at the left base and
there is continued elevation of the left hemidiaphragmatic
contour.

[**2169-11-23**] In comparison with the study of [**11-17**], there has been
substantial volume loss in the left lung with opacification of
most of the left hemithorax following stent removal. Some patchy
quality of the opacification raises the possibility of
supervening aspiration or hemorrhage from recent bronchoscopy.

Chest CT: [**2169-11-27**]
1. Negative examination for pulmonary embolism.
2. Long-term stability of noncalcified pulmonary nodules,
consistent with a benign etiology.
3. Stable appearance of the left lower lobe post-surgical
changes with
scarring.
4. Coronary calcifications.
5. Mucoid impactation in bronchi of left lower lobe.



Brief Hospital Course:
64F with OSA, severe COPD, and TBP s/p removal of Y-stent [**11-23**]
who is admitted to the MICU post-procedurally with left lung
collapse and evidence of mucus plugging and aspiration and
respiratory failure. She was placed on CPAP with aggressive
pulmonary toileting, chest PT and mucolytics. Intravenous
steroids were started for COPD excerbation.  Cardiac enzymes
were negative.  On [**2168-11-23**] she had Flexible bronchoscopy which
showed granulation tissue distal to LMS occluding 75% of lunar.
Distal airway was patent.  She then procedued to the operating
room for Rigid bronchoscopy, Cryotherapy for debridement of
granulation tissue, distal left main-stem. Balloon dilatation to
10 mm, distal left main-stem. Mechanical debridement of
granulation tissue, left main-stem.  She tolerated the procedure
her saturations were monitored in the ICU prior to transfer to
the floor. The post procedure chest film showed some residual
atelectasis and possibly effusion at the left base with
elevation of the left hemidiaphragmatic contour, no recurrence
of the substantial volume loss seen previously and no evidence
of pneumothorax. Her oxygenation improved Sats were 91% on 2L
nasal cannula.  She transferred to the floor on a steroid taper,
home CPAP settings, aggressive pulmonary toileting and chest PT.
 On [**2169-11-25**] her pain was managed with PO pain medicaiton, the
foley was removed and she voided. Her diet was advanced and she
ambulated in the halls.  On [**2169-11-26**] she had an episode of atrial
fibrillation in the 150's.  She was given IV lopressor with
spontaneous conversion to sinus rhythm.  She was started on a
standing dose of low dose beta-blocker, her lytes were repleted.
 On [**2169-11-27**] Chest CT was negative for pulmonary embolism. On
[**2169-11-28**] her respiratory status was at baseline, she continued on
a steroid taper, and was discharged to home with VNA.  She will
follow-up as an outpatient.
