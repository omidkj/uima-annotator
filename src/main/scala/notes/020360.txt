Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Ciprofloxacin / Ambien

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2704**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Endotracheal Intubation
DC Cardioversion
Arterial Line Placement
Central Venous Line Placement

History of Present Illness:
84F with hx CAD, CHF (DD) who was discharged from the CHF/[**Hospital Unit Name 196**]
service on [**2134-6-20**], called EMS the evening of discharge with SOB
and DOE and was found to be in VTach, BP was stable, she was
started on IV Amio, spontaneously converted to afib, then
dropped BP. Pt was intubated en route to hospital.
Intermittently in and out of VTach/afib. In [**Name (NI) **], pt BP dropped
during afib with rate 150bpm, DCCV with conversion to sinus at
70 bpm. BP remained at 80 systolic, Levophed started.
Post-cardioversion EKG showed [**Street Address(2) 1766**] depressions in I, II, III,
F, V4, 5, and 6, believed to be result of cardioversion and not
representing new ischemia. Pt received 100 mg IV lasix en route
to hospital. CXR showed florid pulmonary edema.
.
Transferred to CCU. Pt was reintubated on arrival to CCU because
of air leak around ET tube, and anesthesiology noted difficult
intubation. TLC placed in RIJ, and A-line placed in L radial
artery. Was sent to CCU on integrillin gtt, which was d/c'ed due
to low suspicion of AMI.

Brief Hospital Course:
82F with CAD, CHF (DD) and afib, admitted after developing
"flash" pulmonary edema due to VT/Afib.

Afib/VT: Pt had been on PO amio 200mg PO bid at admission, but
reloaded with IV amio. Was changed to 400mg PO bid on [**6-22**].
Remained in NSR throughout admission. [**Month/Year (2) 5937**] intervals were
monitored.  On discharge patient was given 400 mg amiodarone PO
for a two week period, which is to be followed by 200 mg PO
amiodarone qd. EP followed the patient and did not recommend
pacer/ICD therapy.

CHF: Secondary to diastolic dysfxn. Pulmonary edema on admission
was a consequence of Afib/Vtach, not due to volume overloaded
state. Levophed was quickly weaned after
arrival to CCU. Echo done on [**2134-6-22**] showed: EF 70-80%, mild
symmetric LVH, abnormal systolic flow contour at rest, but not
LVOT obstruction. Mild AS (AV valve area 1.7cm2, pk gradient 46,
mean gradient 27), [**12-27**]+ MR, mild PA systolic HTN.  No
significant changes from previous [**4-29**] echo.

BPs initially labile, with most readings in 160s/100s, but with
unexpected drops down to 90s/50s, always asymptomatic during
these episodes.

Upon discharge, metoprolol was titrated up to 50mg PO TID, and
patient started on valsartan 80mg PO BID for afterload
reduction.  Anxiety likley played a huge component of patient
symptoms, with panic attacks associated with tachycardia and
acute pulmonary edema due to severe diastolic dysfucntion.
Patient does not tolerate benzodizepines per report.  Started
Celexa low dose near end of hospitalization.

CAD: Initial CK: 110 and trended down. Troponin rose to 0.31
morning after admission.  Continued ASA, Plavix, lipitor, and
metoprolol, and restarted valsartan on [**6-24**].  No evidence of
ischemia during this hospitalization.

Dyspnea: Patient admitted with dyspnea and was likely from
"flash" pulmonary edema secondary to vtach/afib.  Episodic
dyspnea continued during stay.  Etiology thought to be
multifactorial.  Has h/o OSA on home BiPap.

Pulmonary edema from admission resolved over first two days of
admission. Initial CXR showed retrocardiac infiltrate suggesting
of PNA, and pt spiked occasional fevers to 101.5 F during
admission. Also had an element of reactive airway disease
responsive to albuterol/ipratropium nebs. Added vancomycin 1gm
q48 to Ceftriaxone being given for UTI due to h/o MRSA. Sputum
and blood cx's NGTD.

UTI: Pansensitive E. Coli from [**6-20**] UCx.  Patient had reported
allergy to fluoroquinolones & concerned about [**Last Name (LF) 5937**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] started
7-day course CTX.  New UCx and BCx sent, brief course of Zosyn
which was completed at time of discharge.

ARF: Cr 1.5 on admission, possible effective p
