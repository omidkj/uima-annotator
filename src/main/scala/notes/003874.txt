Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Vancomycin Hcl / Rocephin

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2297**]
Chief Complaint:
flank pain, fever

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
A-line placement
changing of R mid-line over guidewire

History of Present Illness:
This is a morbidly obese 54 female w/DM1 complicated by
retinopathy, neuropathy and nephropathy s/p cadaveric kidney
transplant in [**2193**] on immunosuppression who p/w fever and flank
pain to OSH ([**Hospital3 **]), now being transferred here with
sepsis on pressor.
.
Pt initially presente on [**4-27**] to OSH with fevers up to 102.6,
b/l flank pain and difficulty urinating. Stable BP, RR of 26 on
admission. Her skin revealed a reddened area over her right
breast as well as an oozing opening over her morbidly obese
abdomen. Lactate was 4.8 on admission to the ICU for IVF
resuscitation. CT abdomen/pelvis showed inflammation over the
lower anterior abdominal wall.
.
Pt was initially started empirically on ceftazidime and
levofloxacin (allergic to Vanco and CTX), then switched to
penicillin and kept on levofloxacin after culture data came
back; urine culture was positive for proteus (nearly
pan-sensitive per verbal signout from OSH) and Bcx came back
positive for beta-hemolytic strep B (sensitive to penicillin).
She was later found to be in septic shock requiring
Neosynephrine drip. She was also started on stress dose steroids
(hydrocortisone), but switched to prednisone on transfer. Her BP
was 90/41 on tapering doses of Neo on transfer. She wa initially
somewhat obtunded but responded appropriately to questions after
initial resuscitation.
.
Her respiratory status remained stable with 93% on 2-3L NC. BNP
was 143. CXR was unremarkable. Latest ABG on day of transfer was
7.30/37/62. Lactate came down to 1.5. WBC was 23.3 with 48%
bands on transfer. Hct was 27.3. There were no signs of bleeding
but pt has h/o GIB. Patient received 1U pRBC on day of transfer
with Hct coming up to 30.6. R triple PICC is in place after
unsuccessful TLC attempt. Last BUN/Cr of 50/1.5. I/Os: 3610 in
and 500 out + additional 700 out on day of transfer. BGs in 200s
on ISS and standing insulin.
.
On arrival to ICU, pt is still on Neo, mentating well, without
pain, fever or SOB.
.
ROS: Denies any CP, abdominal pain, F/C/N, SOB.

Pertinent Results:
OSH labs:
WBC 25 (18% bands). Hct 29.3. Plt 168.
Na 136, K 4.6, Cl 108, CO2 21, BUN 53, Cr 1.6. Glc 229.
.
Micro data from OSH:
Bcx [**4-29**]: NGTD
Wound cx (abdomen) [**4-28**]: preliminary growth with proteus,
enterococcus, GNR, beta hemolytic strep B
UCx [**4-27**]: Proteus mirabilis, pan-sensitive except for
Ampicillin, Cephalothin, Gent, Nitrofurantoin, Tetracycline and
Tobramycin.
Bcx [**4-27**] (4/4 bottles): Beta hemolytic Strep B in anearobic and
aerobic bottles.
.
Imaging:
CXR at OSH: no acute process
.
CT abdomen/pelvis at OSH on [**4-27**]:
Severely limited study. Small shrunken kidneys b/l. Transplanted
kidney on right without gross hydro.
.
Echocardiogram on [**2197-12-12**]:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is moderate symmetric
left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size
is normal. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall
motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. The aortic
valve leaflets appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears structurally
normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. The pulmonary artery
systolic pressure could not be determined. There is no
pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2194-1-14**],
there is no definite change.

Renal u/s on admission: Very limited study due to patient's body
habitus and clinical condition. The transplanted kidney is not
clearly visualized..

TTE: IMPRESSION: Extremely difficult windows, cannot assess
ventricular function or valvular abnormalities. A TEE is
indicated if clinically suggested

TEE: unable to perform as patient's soft tissue around neck will
not support the level of sedation necessary for study without
intubation for airway maintenance.

Brief Hospital Course:
54 female w/DM1 complicated by retinopathy, neuropathy and
nephropathy s/p cadaveric kidney transplant in [**2193**] on
immunosuppression who p/w fever and flank pain to OSH ([**Hospital 28941**]), was transferred here with sepsis on pressor which could
be weaned off the same night.
.
# Mental status: The patient was quite drowsy on various
occasions likely due to a combination of her severe infections,
hypercarbia when she refused her nocturnal bipap, and renal
function.  The day prior to discharge she returned to her
baseline mental status, and remained responsive to questions and
oriented x 3, although somewhat drowsy.

# septic shock: The patient was started on neosynephrine for
blood pressure support at the outside hospital, however on
arrival to our MICU, seh received several liters of fluid and
arterial line was placed which showed stable blood pressures.
She was found to have three infectious sources for her sepsis:

1. Beta hemolytic group A streptococcus bacteremia: The patient
was followed by the infectious disease team. No clear source was
found, however she may have some abdominal cellulitis in her
pannus which may be the source for this. She was started on
Penicillin G IV and dose was adjusted as her renal function
improved. We attempted TTE and TEE to rule out endocarditis,
however TTE was not able to visualize her valves due to habitus
and TEE could not be performed due to inability to protect her
airway if sedated given her habitus. She will therefore be kept
on Penicillin G 4 million units IV q 4 hours for a total of 4
weeks of therapy. Day 1 is [**2198-4-29**]. After this course is
completed her R midline should be removed.

2. Proteus UTI: Teh patient had a urine infection with proteus
which was sensitive to ciprofloxacin and she was started on
ciprofloxacin therapy 400mg IV BID for a total of 14 days. Day
one was [**4-29**].

3. Coagulase negative staphalococcus
