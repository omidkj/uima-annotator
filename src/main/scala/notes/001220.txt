History of Present Illness:
HPI:  This is a 41 homeless man with no known medical history

.
CT spine:
1. Comminuted nasal bone fractures.
2. Severe mucosal thickening in the ethmoid sinuses and nasal
cavity.
3. No evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage.
.
CXR: 24 year-old male with hypothermia, intubation. A single
portable view of the chest reveals slight rotation to the right.
No evidence of a pneumothorax. An endotracheal tube is in
satisfactory position. The lungs are well inflated. The ribcage
is intact with no evidence of a fracture. A nasogastric tube tip
lies in the stomach.
.
EKG:  Baseline artifact. Sinus bradycardia. Modest non-specific
intraventricular conduction delay. Prominent"J" point in leads
V4-V6 - possible [**Doctor Last Name **] wave. Findings suggest hypothermia.
Clinical correlation is suggested. No previous tracing available
for comparison.
.
CTA:
1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
2. Moderate-to-large bilateral pleural effusions with associated
atelectasis.
3. Airspace opacity and infiltrate noted in the lungs, most
predominantly in the left lower lobe. Diffuse patchy nodular
opacities also seen scattered throughout the upper and right
middle lobes. Nodular findings could represent infection versus
metastasis, and followup imaging following treatment is
recommended to document resolution.
.
ECHO:  The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity size, and systolic function are normal
(LVEF>55%). Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal.
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with
good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral
valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral
regurgitation. There is no mitral valve prolapse. There is no
systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve leaflets. The
estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is
 no pericardial effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
43 year old white male with hypothermia and unknown source of
fevers.
1.  Pulmonary - Patient was initally intubated for airway
production but rapidly extubated after improvement of
hemodynamics, metabolic acidosis, and mental status.  Upon
extubation, patient had a nonproductive cough and fevers
concerning for PNA.  Although he had a clear CXR, given LOC and
possible aspiration event, he was started on Unasyn.  His fever
and cough persisted with a continued O2 requirement despite
antibiotics.  Antibiotics were thus changed to Zosyn.  The
patient was started on vancomycin for persistent fevers and
tachypnea.  He received nebulizer treatments and chest PT given
possible underlying obstructive lung disease.  Seven days prior
to discharge, patient was changed to oral cefpdoxime (with plan
to end course on [**1-27**]); patient's respiratory status was at
baseline, on room air, satting well with ambulation. No evidence
of hospital acquired organisms.
.
2. Hypothermia -  Unclear etiology of hypothermia, although
likely secondary to exposure in setting of LOC vs early SIRS.
Patient was warmed with bear hugger and warmed IV fluids.
Workup for hypothyroidism was negative.  At the time of
transfer, the patient had been warmed to normal body
temperature.
.
3. Cardiovascular - Patient was admitted with hypothermia, low
WBC, and hypotension concerning for sepsis.  Resuscitated with
large volumes of IV fluids to which his blood pressure
responded.  He remained bradycardic throughout his time in the
ED however maintained a normal blood pressure after fluid
resuscitation without further intervention.  Patient had two,
asymptomatic episodes of bradycardia while on the floor.  His
heart rate was maintained between 60-70s prior to discharge.
.
4. Neuro/Psyche - Patient had altered mental status on
admission, likely secondary to hypothermia, hypoglycemia, or
intoxication.  At the time of transfer, his mental status
improved and he was alert and oriented to person, place, and
time.  He remained oriented to time and place throughout his
stay.  Psychiatry was consulted to address a possible underlying
depression, for which remeron treatment was initiated.  He was
ruled out for a dual diagnosis and not deemed appropriate for an
inpatient hospitalization.
- Alcoholism:  Patient received thiamine iv x3 days, folate, and
an MVI.  He was treated for withdrawal with lorazepam by CIWA
scale and was seen by the addiction nurse.
- Extremity tingling - was initiated on neurontin 200 qhs two
days prior to discharge. Patient should follow up with his PCP
regarding possible EtOH induced neuropathy.
.
5. Rhabdomyolysis: Patient was admitted with elevated CK likely
secondary to prolonged LOC.  He was treated with aggressive
fluid hydration to prevent renal failure.  Serial CKs
demonstrated a steadily decreasing CK. Creatinine was 0.5 at the
time of transfer.  Renal function remained stable throughout
stay.
.
6. Pancreatitis: Admitted with elevated pancreatic enzymes,
likely secondary to EtOH.  His enzymes trended down throughout
his admission.  He was asymptomatic through the admission and
tolerated a PO diet at the time of transfer.
- hepatitis serologies were checked, which showed prior exposure
to hepatitis B.
.
7. Left hand swelling: Likely [**1-24**] trauma.  He was followed
clinically without any evidence of compartment syndrome or clot.
 Edema had resolved at time of transfer.
.
8. Heme:
- Thrombocytopenia: Unknown etiology/baseline. HIT negative.
Question secondary to alcoholism/hypersplenism. [**Month (only) 116**] be secondary
to marrow suppression in setting of acute illness. HIV was
negative
- Anemia: Normocytic, although M
