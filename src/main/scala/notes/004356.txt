HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname **] is an 85 year-old
man who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting x2 as well
as aortic valve replacement on [**2155-4-7**] by Dr. [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **] [**Initial (NamePattern1) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 70**]. His postoperative course was uneventful except for
atrial fibrillation for which he was discharged on Coumadin.
The patient was doing well at home until the day before
admission when he developed increasing chest pain and fever.
EMS was called and he was taken to [**Hospital3 3583**] where he
was noted to be febrile to 203 in rapid atrial fibrillation
with a ventricular response in the 120s and an increased
white blood cell count to 18,000 with an INR of 4.2,
otherwise unremarkable. His chest x-ray was reportedly
negative and he was transferred to the [**Hospital1 190**] for further work up and care.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Is significant for coronary artery
bypass graft x2 as well an aortic valve replacement and
tissue valve, coronary artery disease, aortic stenosis,
prostate carcinoma, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, rectal
bleeding, status post cauterization, cholelithiasis, status
post abdominal aortic aneurysm repair in [**2145**], status post
bilateral hernia repairs, status post right lung surgery,
chronic renal insufficiency with a baseline creatinine of
1.1, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

MEDICATIONS AT HOME:  Included aspirin 81 mg daily, Colace
100 mg b.i.d., Flovent 110 2 puffs b.i.d., Percocet 5/325 1
to 2 tablets p.o. q 4 to 6 hours p.r.n., Atrovent 2 puffs
q.i.d., Protonix 40 mg daily, Lopressor 25 mg b.i.d., Lipitor
20 mg daily, Bacitracin ointment to air lesions, Celexa 10 mg
daily and Warfarin which is held from [**4-18**] on due to an
elevated INR.

ALLERGIES:  Patient states no known drug allergies.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  At time of admission temperature 99.9,
pulse 94, blood pressure 124/70, respiratory rate 24, O2
saturation 94% on 3 liters by nasal cannula. Neurologic
grossly intact, moves all extremities without difficulty.
Pulmonary with scattered rhonchi, diminished breath sounds at
the bases. Cardiovascular: Irregularly irregular with no
murmur. Abdomen is soft and nontender, nondistended.
Extremities are warm with no edema. Sternum is stable with
Steri-Strips. No erythema or drainage.

Patient was admitted to CT surgery. He was scheduled for a
chest CT as well as a chest x-ray and echocardiogram. He was
begun on Vancomycin and levofloxacin pending the results of
blood and wound cultures. Chest CT showed a suspicious for
small subcutaneous fluid collection. Also a deep infected
fluid collection. Superficial exploration relieved the small
fluid collection. Culture was sent. The bone appeared to be
intact at that time and it was decided to treat the patient
conservatively with frequent dressing changes plus or minus
the operating room for debridement if there was no
significant improvement. Over the next several days the
patient's wound showed significant improvement with
decreasing amounts of drainage and beginnings of granulation
tissue in the wound margins. A PICC line was placed on
hospital day #4 for anticipated long term Vancomycin
infusions. However, on hospital day 8 it was noted that the
patient's sternal drainage had again increased with the wound
appearing less stable and at this time decision was made to
bring him to the operating room for surgical incisions and
drainage of the wound with plus or minus sternal debridement.
The patient did indeed undergo sternal debridement once in
the operating room. Please the operating room report for full
details. He tolerated the operation well and was transferred
from the operating room to the Cardiothoracic Intensive Care
Unit. At the time of transfer the patient's chest was open
with packed sternal wound. He was also seen by plastic
surgery at that time. Over the next several days the patient
remained in the Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit. During
that period he was chemically paralyzed and sedated with an
open chest wound. He remained hemodynamically stable
throughout that period and on [**5-1**] the patient was brought
to the operating room once again for bilateral pectoralis
advancement flaps and sternal wound closure. He tolerated
this operation well. Please seen the operating room report
for full details.

Following wound closure he was transferred from the operating
room to the Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit without
complications. Following wound closure the patient's
paralytics were discontinued. On postoperative day #1 he was
weaned from the ventilator and successfully extubated. He was
begun on oral beta blockade and his diet was advanced as
tolerated and on postoperative day #3 he was transferred to
floor for continuing postoperative care and activity
advancement. Over the next week the patient had an uneventful
hospital course. His activity was increased with the
assistance of nursing and physical therapy. The [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1661**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1662**]
drains in his chest were removed by plastic surgery service
and on postoperative day #11 and #8 it was decided that the
patient was stable and ready to be transferred to
rehabilitation. At the time of this dictation the patient's
physical is as follows: Temperature 98.3, heart rate 74 in
atrial fibrillation, blood pressure 116/60, respiratory rate
20, O2 saturation 95% on room air. Weight preoperatively 80
kilos, at discharge is 82.5 kilos.

LABORATORY DATA:  White count 7.3, hematocrit 33.8, platelets
266, sodium 140, potassium 4.0, chloride 101, CO2 32, BUN 13,
creatinine 1.1, glucose 97, PT is 18.2 with an INR of 2.1.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Neurologically alert and oriented
times three, moves all extremities, follows commands,
nonfocal examination. Pulmonary: Diminished at the bases with
scattered rhonchi, otherwise clear. Cardiac: Irregularly
irregular, S1 and S2 with no murmurs. Sternum with running
sutures, is open to air, clean and dry. Bilateral deltoid
incisions open to air, clean and dry with one [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1661**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1662**]
drain draining serosanguineous fluid. Abdomen is soft,
nontender, nondistended with normoactive bowel sounds.
Extremities are warm and well perfused with 1 to 2+ edema.
Additionally the patient has a PICC in the left antecubital
space, slight without erythema.

Patient is to be discharged to rehabilitation. He is to have
follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in the plastic surgery clinic one
week following transfer for assessment of [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1661**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1662**]
drain. Follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 70**] in four to six weeks and
follow up with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] four weeks after discharge
from rehabilitation.
