Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
lisinopril

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2901**]
Chief Complaint:
STEMI

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2198-1-11**] - Left heart catheterization with drug eluting stent in
left anterior descending artery
[**2198-1-15**] - Left heart cath with drug eluting stent to an obtuse
marginal and posterolateral branch

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 47yo male with past medical history of htn, hld
and family history of CABG in his brother at age 38, who was
found to have STEMI and is s/p LHC with intervention. The
patient reports that he had had about 2 weeks of chest pain,
which had been right sided and associated with right arm
tingling. There was associated nausea. He had no associated
dyspnea. He reports that he did note chest pain in his sternum
once when he was running. He is able to walk up flights of
stairs, limited by knee pain not SOB. He does endorse a dry
cough, which has started since he began lisinopril (now
discontinued).
.
His PCP, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) **], got biomarkers and found his troponin to
be elevated to 0.66. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] called Mr. [**Known lastname **] to advise that
he report to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED. En route to the ED, the patient did
experiencing acute chest pain, he received nitro which brought
the pain to a [**2-20**] but ongoing chest pressure. In the ED, his
EKG revealed STE in V2-V4 and Q's in III, aVF and V2-V3. He was
loaded with Plavix 600mg, heparin bolus and aspirin. In the cath
lab, the patient was found to have:  LAD with 99% mid occlusion;
diffuse 60% mid to distal occlusions; LCX 90% major OM; RCA 80%
posterolateral. He received drug eluting stent of mid LAD with
2.75 x 28 Promus. Diffuse moderately severe disease in mid to
distal LAD was not dilated. He was hemodynamically stable
throughout the procedure.
.
On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or
red stools. He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors. He denies
exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other review of
systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of dyspnea on
exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema,
palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

Brief Hospital Course:
47M with a PMH significant for HTN, HLD, tremor who presented
with STEMI s/p LHC and placement of proximal LAD (single drug
eluting Promus stent) noted to have three vessel disease; with
LCx and RHC involvement. S/P DES x2 on [**1-15**] to OM and RPL
.
# CAD:  Patient presented to [**Hospital1 18**] for management of STEMI.  The
patient was found to have three vessel disease on initial left
heart cath and had intervention on the LAD, which was thought to
be the culprit lesion.  He was started on ASA 325 mg PO daily
and initially received Prasugrel 10mg PO daily s/p load of
clopidogrel 600 mg PO x1 for dual antiplatlet therapy. Received
eptifibatide at 2 mcg/kg/min x 18 hours after the initial
cardiac cath. Immediately after the first LHC, he was noted to
have ongoing ST segment elevations.  Started on losartan for
afterload reduction (has cough to ACEi) and to decrease cardiac
work. Home propranolol was changed to metoprolol at discharge.
Plan to continue Plavix for 1 year for DES, also started on high
dose statin (atorvastatin 80mg).  A transthoracic echo performed
after the intial cardiac catheterization and showed evidence of
apical akinesis with an EF of 35%.  He was discharged on
warfarin to prevent thrombus formation.  As mentioned below, he
will need a repeat TTE in 6 weeks to evaluate whether he would
benefit from ICD placement.
.
# HTN: Patient with history of hypertension. At discharge, his
home antihypertensive regimen will be changed to metoprolol and
losartan as above.
.
CHRONIC CARE:
# HLD: lipids elevated in [**2197-9-11**], with LDL of 163 and total
cholesterol of 256. High dose atorvastatin at discharge because
he is s/p STEMI.
.
# Cervical dystonic tremor: the patient is following with
neurology and may proceed with Botulism injections to
