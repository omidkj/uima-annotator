Admission Date:  [**2142-6-11**]     Discharge Date:  [**2142-6-15**]

Date of Birth:   [**2064-9-22**]     Sex:  M

Service:  [**Hospital1 **]

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname 8040**] is a 77-year-old male
with a medical history significant for coronary disease
status post myocardial infarction in [**2108**], multiple
transient ischemic attacks, hypertension, gastrointestinal
bleed, type 2 diabetes mellitus, renal cell carcinoma with
metastases to the lungs, status post partial left nephrectomy
and end stage renal disease on hemodialysis who presented
with progressive dyspnea on exertion for the past four weeks.

On the day of presentation, [**2142-6-11**], the patient was at
his [**Hospital **] Clinic appointment where he was found to be
dyspneic with just short walking and found to have an oxygen
saturation of 83% on room air.  Of note, just one month prior
in clinic, the patient had an oxygen saturation of 99% on
room air.  He denied history of orthopnea, or paroxysmal
nocturnal dyspnea and reported no chest pain at the time.
Mr. [**Known lastname 8040**] was subsequently transferred to the [**Hospital6 1760**] Emergency Department, where
his breathing became more labored requiring 100%
nonrebreather, which resulted in an oxygen saturation in the
low 90s.  His initial vitals were as follows:  Temperature of
98.1.  Heart rate of 76.  Blood pressure 160/80. Respiratory
rate of 14.  His oxygen saturation was in the low 90s with
100% nonrebreather.

He had diffuse rhonchi and crackles on his lung exam and
evidence of volume overload on physical examination.  His
chest x-ray demonstrated findings consistent with congestive
heart failure, bilateral pleural effusion, bibasilar
collapse, consolidation, and mediastinal hilar
lymphadenopathy with diffuse bilateral small nodules,
consistent with metastatic disease.

A repeat chest x-ray revealed worsening pulmonary edema
consistent with congestive heart failure.  Patient's blood
pressure also rose to 230/120 requiring intravenous
nitroglycerin drip.  Once the patient was stabilized, he was
transferred to the floor for further care and management.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Renal cell carcinoma.  Renal cell carcinoma was
discovered during a work-up for abdominal pain in [**2135-5-30**], which revealed bilateral renal masses.  CT and MI scan
revealed 3 cm mass in left upper pole and a 4 cm mass in
upper right pole and patient is now status post left partial
nephrectomy for cancer treatment as of [**2135-6-30**].
2.  End stage renal disease.  Patient's end stage renal
disease is likely secondary to type 2 diabetes mellitus, as
well as renal cell carcinoma status post left partial
nephrectomy.  He is currently on hemodialysis treatment at
[**Location (un) 1468**] Dialysis Unit on a Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday
schedule.
3.  Type 2 diabetes mellitus.  Diabetes is currently
controlled with diet.
4.  Coronary disease.  Patient is status post myocardial
infarction in the [**2108**] and had recent chest pain in the past
which has been worked up.
5.  Hypertension.
6.  History of transient ischemic attack.  First demonstrated
in [**2135-6-30**] postoperatively from nephrectomy, which was
partial on the left kidney.  There has also been an episode
where he became unresponsive with straining and extension of
his right arm.  MI and MRA of the head showed small vessel
disease and evidence for an old left-sided cerebral
infarction.  This work-up was done on previous admissions.
7.  Gout.
8.  Sciatica.
9.  Cataracts.  Patient is status post bilateral cataract
surgery.
10. Benign prostatic hypertrophy.  He is status post
suprapubic prostatectomy in [**2139-7-31**].
11. Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.
12. Hypercholesterolemia.
13. Hemicolectomy for massive gastrointestinal bleed
secondary to CMV colitis exacerbated by aspirin.

ALLERGIES:  Penicillin causes rashes.  Aspirin exacerbates
gastrointestinal bleed.

MEDICATIONS:  The patient on previous admissions was on:
1.  Claritin 10 mg po q.d.
2.  Digoxin 125 mcg po q.d.
3.  Imdur 90 mg po q.d.
4.  Isosorbide 60-90 mg po q.d.
5.  Metoprolol 75 mg po b.i.d.
6.  Nephrocaps 1 mg po q.d.
7.  Nifedipine ER 60 mg po q.h.s.
8.  Phos-Lo.
9.  Ranitidine 75-250 mg po q.h.s.
10. Ticlid 250 mg po q.d.
11. Zestril 20 mg po q.d.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Significant for renal cell carcinoma in both
father and brother.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Significant for no alcohol or tobacco abuse.
Patient also denies illicit drug use.  He lives with his wife
of 55 years and is a War World II veteran.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On initial physical examination in the
Emergency Department, the patient was breathing heavily in
mild distress in a bed.  He appeared his stated age and
cachectic, otherwise, he was pleasant, alert and oriented
times three.  His vitals were a temperature of 98.1.  Heart
rate of 76.  Blood pressure 160/80 with intermittent rise to
systolic blood pressure of 230 and a respiratory rate of 14.
His initial weight was approximately 73 kg.  His head, eyes,
ears, nose and throat exam:  Normocephalic, atraumatic.
Anicteric and noninjected sclera.  No lesions in the
oropharynx and upper dentures were noted.  Pupils are equal,
round, and reactive to light and accommodation.  His
Extraocular muscles were intact.  No rhinorrhea was
appreciated.  Neck exam:  Soft, trachea midline.  Jugular
venous pressure was 8-9 cm and no thyromegaly was noted.
Pulmonary chest exam:  Rhonchi on expiration bilaterally with
mild crackles, left greater than right.  heart exam:
Regular, audible, but distant S1, S2, 1-2/6 systolic murmur
heard loudest at the base, no rubs or gallops were
appreciated.  Abdominal exam:  Nondistended, positive bowel
sounds, soft and nontender, no hepatosplenomegaly.  Back
exam:  No CVA tenderness bilaterally.  Genitourinary exam:
Deferred.  Rectal exam:  Deferred.  Pulses:  2+ radial pulses
and palpable, 1+ pedal pulses bilaterally.  Extremity exam:
[**11-30**]+ pitting peripheral edema, especially in the lower
extremities.  AV fistula noted in the left upper extremity
with good thrill.  Neurological exam:  Alert and oriented
times three.  Cranial nerves II through XII tested and were
intact.  Dermatology exam:  Very mild psoriatic rash on
scalp, face and extensor surfaces.  There is also some brown
discoloration of skin noted on anterior tibial aspect on the
right leg.

LABORATORY DATA:  The patient's initial CBC showed white
blood cell count of 8.0, hematocrit 38.0, and a platelet
count of 280.  His Chem-7 demonstrated sodium of 139,
potassium 3.9, chloride 92, bicarbonate 35, BUN of 34,
creatinine 7.2 and blood sugar of 111.  His first CK enzyme
came back 65 which was within normal limits.  His first
troponin T came back as 0.21.  Second set was 0.27.  Third
set was 0.27.  Fourth set was 0.22 and a fifth set was 0.19.
His calcium level was 9.0, phosphate of 4.4 and magnesium of
1.9.  His digoxin level was found to be 1.3.  His blood gas
was shown to have PO2 of 38, pCO2 of 41, and a pH of 7.56.
His lactate level was 1.0.

His first chest x-ray revealed findings consistent with
previous heart failure with bilateral pleural effusions,
bibasilar collapsing consolidation in mediastinal hilar
lymphadenopathy with diffuse bilateral small nodules
consistent with metastases.

The patient also had an electrocardiogram done which showed
no acute changes from previous studies.  There were still
signs of left ventricular hypertrophy strain, but otherwise,
no clear evidence for myocardial infarction.

An echocardiogram on [**6-12**] demonstrated left ventricular
ejection fraction of greater than 55% and a small right to
left intracardiac shunt, most likely consistent with atrial
septal defect.  Pulmonary artery systolic hypertension was
noted, but there was preserved global and regional
biventricular systolic function.  There was mild aortic
regurgitation and mild mitral regurgitation.

HOSPITAL COURSE:

1.  Shortness of breath:  The patient was transferred to the
floor on the day of admission for further care and
management, however, after a couple hours, he complained of
increased dyspnea on exertion and had an oxygen saturation of
approximately 80% on 100% nonrebreather wi
