Chief Complaint:
1. Hyperglycemia
2. Hypothermia

Intubation
Dialysis
Endoscopy


History of Present Illness:
60F w seizure hx and diabetes was found down today in fetal
position and brought to ED by EMS.  She was noted to be
hypothermic and hyperglycemic.  Unclear how long she was down.
There was no evidence of trauma.

In the ED, she was found to have blood in her mouth, she was
intubated for airway protection and had a central line placed.
She required phenylephrine briefly during intubation, but
otherwise did not require any pressors.  She was sedated with
fent/midaz. Because of the blood in her mouth and OG was placed
with return of coffee ground.  She was started on a PPI gtt.
Her initial serum glucose was 900 and she was started on an
insulin drip.

For her hypothermia she was given warm saline, warm air through
the ED tube and a bear hugger.  A CT scan was done which showed
pancreatic stranding around the head and gallbladder sludge.  AN
ECG was note to have some QRS widening (120) comparred to prior
(100)

Upon review of previous notes in OMR, the patient intermitantly
threatens noncompliance with her insulin therapy and has a
length history of impulse control problems, for which she sees
psychiatry.  Seizure disorder history is unclear and unproven,
but was prescribed Tegretol.  Most recent HbA1c was 7.9.  Her
last note indicates that she did agree to taking all of her
prescribed medications, including her Tegretol and insulin.  She
inappropriately and frequently calls her providers and it has
been difficult in the past to get her to agree to medications
that will control her chronic issues, with threatened section
12's to get her into the hospital for appropriate treatment.

Studies:
.
[**11-18**] CT Spine - IMPRESSION: 1. No acute fracture or subluxation
of the cervical spine. Moderate narrowing of the central canal
at C5-6 is noted, and if there are myelopathic symptoms, these
could be better evaluated with MRI. 2. Soft tissue within
pharynx and hypopharynx consistent with history of hemorrhage. A
mucosal or submucosal pharyngeal/hypopharyngeal mass is not
excluded, which could be clarified by direct visualization. 3.
Intubated patient, with the tip of endotracheal tube projecting
1 cm from the level of the carina, this should be withdrawn for
appropriate positioning vs re-evaluated with chest radiograph.
.
[**11-18**] CT Head - IMPRESSION: 1. No acute intracranial injury.
There is stable age-appropriate atrophy. 2. Air-fluid levels
within multiple paranasal sinuses.
.
[**11-18**] CT Abdomen/Pelvis - IMPRESSION: 1. Stranding of the
retroperitoneal fat in the region of the pancreatic head, second
and third portions of the duodenum, extending to the region of
the gallbladder fossa. Differential diagnosis includes
gallbladder pathology, pancreatitis, and duodenitis, which might
be clarified with laboratory analysis. 2. Bibasilar atelectasis.
A well-circumscribed stable mass is seen in the left paraspinal
location, benign.
.
[**11-19**] ECHO - IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with normal regional and global systolic function.
Mild right ventricular cavity enlargement with low no
