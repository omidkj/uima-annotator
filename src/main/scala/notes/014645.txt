Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2265**]
Chief Complaint:
chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac catheterization

History of Present Illness:
71 yo M with CAD s/p CABG, PVD s/p LE bypass, CKD stage II, DM,
HTN who presented to an OSH with chest pain, found to have
anterolateral ST depressions and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for
cardiac catheterization.  Patient developed chest pain this
afternoon at noon while getting into his car.  Pain was
associated with nausea and vomiting x2, diaphoresis and
shortness of breath and was not relieved with rest or with SL
nitroglycerin.  EMS administered 3 SL nitroglycerins and 4 baby
aspirins. [**Name2 (NI) **] was taken to [**Hospital6 33**] where pain
was [**11-28**] and BP was 118/74.  EKG showed anterolateral ST
depressions.  Initial CEs were negative.  Patient received 5mg
IV lopressor x2, ativan 1mg IV, and 600mg plavix.  Patient was
loaded with integrillin and started on integrillin drip and
heparin drip and was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for catheterization.
.
On arrival to [**Hospital1 18**], VS were afebrile, BP 116-130's/70-80's, HR
90's-100's sinus, 92-95% on 100% NRB (was 91% on r/a prior).
Patient was taken to the cath lab where 95% occlusion of SVG to
OM1 was noted and opened with DES.  Patient was transferred to
CCU for further management.
.
On arrival to the CCU, VS were HR 82, BP 118/62, RR 12, 96% on
6LNC.  Patient was awake and alert and denied any ongoing chest
pain. He reports that he has CP regularly, usually associated
with movement.  He has chest pain and shortness of breath when
walking across the room.  He has PVD and reports claudication in
bilateral lower extremities.

Admission studies:
- ECG:  Sinus tachycardia, ST depressions in V3-V6, T wave
inversions in V4-V6 and I, avL.
.
- CARDIAC CATH:
1.  Severe left main and native 3 vessel CAD
2.  Widely patent LIMA to LAD
3.  High-grade stenosis in SVG to D1/OM2
4.  100% ostial occlusion of radial graft to PDA
5.  Note marked elevation of left heart filling pressure
6.  Successful PTCA/stent of SVG using DES and distal protection
with Spider filter

Pertinent studies:
Echocardiogram ([**2113-7-12**]): The left atrium is elongated. There is
mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular cavity size is top normal/borderline dilated. LV
systolic function appears probably moderately depressed;
estimated LVEF ?40% but views are suboptimal. Apical wall motion
appears preserved. There are thinned akinetic inferolateral
segments and possible inferior hypokinesis but views are
suboptimal for assessment of regional wall motion. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion appear grossly
normal but are not well seen. The aortic valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. No significant valvular
regurgitation was detected in suboptimal views. There is no
pericardial effusion.

CXR ([**2113-7-13**]): Opacity within the left lower lobe may indicate
early pneumonia

Urine culture ([**2113-7-13**]): ENTEROCOCCUS SP..    10,000-100,000

Brief Hospital Course:
71 yo male with CAD s/p CABG, PVD, HTN, HL, DM and CKD
presenting with NSTEMI s/p DES to SVG to OM1.

# s/p NSTEMI: Patient had ST depressions on presentation to
outside hospital.  Patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for cardiac
catheterization and DES was placed in the SVG which was 95%
occluded.  Patient was immediately chest pain free following
catheterization.  Femoral sheaths were removed without issue and
patient had no hematoma or bruit.  Patient was continued on home
aspirin and plavix. Patient's simvastatin was changed to
atorvastatin 80mg po daily.  Metoprolol and amlodipine were held
on the night of admission and restarted on HD1.  Echocardiogram
on HD1 showed akinetic inferolateral segments with preserved
apical wall motion.  Cardiac enzymes were initially elevated but
trended down.

# CHF: Patient had elevated LVEDP in catheterization lab
suggesting LV failure.  LV dysfunction is likely due to ischemic
disease with known partial occlusion of grafts.  ECHO showed EF
>40%.  Patient appeared volume overloaded on admission and
diuresed well with IV lasix.  He was euvolemic for the remainder
of admission and was continued on low dose lasix of 40mg.
Metoprolol was continued throughout admission as above.

# Fever: Patient was febrile on hospital day 2 to 101.7.  Blood
culture, urine culture and chest xray were sent.  CXR showed a
potential left lower lobe opacity and patient was started on
levofloxacin.  Urine culture returned positive for enterococcus,
so patient was continued on levofloxacin.  Patient should
continue levofloxacin for 10 total days, ending [**2113-7-23**].  Blood
cultures showed no growth to date at the time of discharge but
were still pending.

# CKD: Patient has chronic kidney disease with baseline
creatinine 1.3-1.5.  Patient remained at baseline throughout
admission.  Medications were renally dose.

# HTN: Patient's blood pressures were stable throughout
admission.  Metoprolol and amlodipine were held the day of
admission and restarted on HD1.

# Hyperlipidemia:  Patient's home simvastatin 80mg was changed
to atorvastatin 80 as high dose simvastatin is now
contraindicated.  In addition, patient had elevated
triglycerides and was started fenofibrate.

# DMII: Patient has poorly controlled diabetes mellitus.  He is
on U-500 30U (equivalent to 150U) TID.  His last HgbA1c was 7.3.
 Blood sugars were well controlled on home insulin regimen with
insulin sliding scale as needed.

#Peripheral neuropathy:  Patient was continued on home
gabapentin.

#Transitional issues:
- Blood cultures from [**2113-7-13**] were pending at the time of
discharge
- Patient will follow-up with his primary care physician and
cardiologist
- Patient was full code throughout admission.
