Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Heparin Agents / Cefepime / Vancomycin

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 425**]
Chief Complaint:
Transfer from [**Hospital1 1474**] for NSTEMI, cardiogenic and septic shock

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac catheterization
Insertion of central venous catheter

History of Present Illness:
HPI: 58 male with h/o CAD s/p MI, DM2, HTN, atrial fibrillation,
morbid obesity presented to [**Hospital 1474**] Hospital with 2-3 days of
productive cough and hemoptysis. He was found to be in
significant respiratory distress, and BiPAP was initiated. He
then became agitated and confused, and he required intubation
with ABG of 7.23/61/66. He then became hypotensive and had
decreased urine output (despite agressive diuresis). He was
eventually started on levophed and neosynephrine, with propofol
for sedation. His CXR was read as an infiltrate; his BNP was
>1100; his cardiac enzymes were elevated, and there were no ST
elevations on his ECG. He was given [**Hospital **], plavix 300, mucomyst,
and moxifloxacin x 1, and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for presumed
cardiogenic shock, NSTEMI, and emergent catheterization.
.
ROS: Per his family, he has had a productive cough for several
weeks, and increasing dyspnea on exertion, orthopnea, and PND.
He did not complain of any chest pain, fevers, chills, nausea,
vomiting, or urinary symptoms. He has had chronic diarrhea since
starting metformin (which has been stopped), and may have been
worse recently. He also complained of intermittent headaches.
.
On arrival to [**Hospital1 18**] he was taken emergently to the cardiac
catheterization lab, where he was found to have three vessel
disease (LM 40-50%; LAD 95% prox/mid; LCx subtotal plaque; RCA
mid 60% and distal 80%. There were no interventions done on the
coronary arteries (felt that the LCx occlusion was old). His
pressures were: RA 29; RV 86/12; PA 74/40; PCW 28; CO 8.7; CI
2.9. A balloon pump was inserted.
.
On arrival to the CCU he was intubated, sedated, with swan ganz
catheter in his right groin, balloon pump through his left
groin.

COMMENTS:
1. Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system
revealed
three vessel disease. The LMCA had an eccentric 50% distal
plaque
extending into the origin of the LCX. The LAD was diffusely
diseased
throughout with a complex, uclerated 95% stenosis in the mid
vessel with
TIMI3 flow. The LCX was a severely diffusely diseased vessel
that was
subtotally occluded proximally. The RCA was a dominant vessel
with an
ulcerated 60% stenosis in the mid vessel and an 80% stenosis in
a
diminutive rPL branch.
2. Resting hemodunamics revealed severely elevated right and
left sided
filling pressures (mRAP 27 mmHg, mPCW 38 mmHg). There was severe

pulmonary arterial hypertension (mPAP 50 mmHg). The cardiac
index was
normal (2.9 l/m/m2).
3. Successful placement of a 40cc intraaortic balloon pump.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Severely elevated right and left sided filling pressures.
3. Severe pulmonary hypertension.
4. Successful balloon pump placement.
.
TEE:
.
Conclusions:
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is
mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction
with hypokinesis of the anterior wall. The remainder of the
walls contract well although the apex is not fully visualized
(estimated ejection fraction ?45%). Right ventricular chamber
size and free wall motion are normal in suboptimal views. There
are complex (>4mm) non-mobile atheroma in the descending
thoracic aorta. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but no aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no pericardial effusion.
.
IMPRESSION: Anterior wall hypokinesis with overall probably
mildly depressed left ventricular systolic function (with IABP
support). No significant valvular disease. Complex, non-mobile
atheroma in descending aorta.
.
INITIAL CXR:
.
Two radiographs of the chest demonstrates an endotracheal tube
with its tip at the level of the clavicular heads. Cardiac size
is not well assessed secondary to portable technique, but there
is probably mild cardiomegaly. There is a nasogastric tube
present with its tip in the stomach. Assessment of the pulmonary
parenchyma is limited by patient rotation and position. No
consolidation is evident. No pleural effusion is detected.
Trachea is midline.
.
IMPRESSION:
.
Satisfactory placement of endotracheal tube.
.
MEASUREMENTS:
Left Ventricle - Ejection Fraction: 35% to 40% (nl >=55%)

INTERPRETATION:

Findings:

The patient was intubated and mechanically ventilated during the
procedure. He was on 1 mg/hr IV of midazolam, and 25mcg/hr for
sedation, which was continued during the procedure. The patient
was receiving IABP support during the procedure. The descending
thoracic aorta was not well visualized due to the presence of
the IABP.
.
RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: A catheter or pacing wire is
seen in the RA.  Normal interatrial septum. No ASD by 2D or
color Doppler.
.
LEFT VENTRICLE: Mild symmetric LVH with normal cavity size.
Mild-moderate
regional LV systolic dysfunction.
.
RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.
.
AORTA: Focal calcifications in aortic root.
.
AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (3). No AR.

.
MITRAL VALVE: Normal mitral valve leaflets with trivial MR.
.
TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets with trivial
TR.
.
PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflets.
Physiologic (normal) PR.
.
PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.
.
