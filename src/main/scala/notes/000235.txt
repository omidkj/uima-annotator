Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1711**]
Chief Complaint:
hypotension

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
endotracheal intubation

History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 67 year old female with a history of Type II DM,
HTN, stage III CKD, and 2 vessel CAD admitted on [**2146-11-3**] with
hyperglycemia. The patient was hospitalized two months ago with
dysphagia and provided history suggestive of CHF. Subsequent
evaluation showed severely depressed LVEF, 20-25%, with elevated
right- and left-sided filling pressures. A diagnostic left- and
right-heart cath was performed, and attempted PCI to mid-LAD was
unsuccessful. The patient was evaluated by CT surgery, and was
determined to be a poor surgical candidate. The patient was
discharged with a plan to optimize medical management of
presumed ischemic heart disease (there had been a question of
possible tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy, alcoholic
cardiomyopathy). Iron studies did not show evidence of
hemachromatosis. The patient had scheduled Cardiology follow up
on [**2146-11-2**] which she unfortunately did not keep. The following
day, the patient was found to be hyperglycemic, with home FSBGs
in the 500s. Since admission, management of hypervolemia from
CHF has been limited by hypotension. We are asked to provide
recommendation for management of patient's CHF.

On further history, patient notes progressive DOE over the past
summer. She denies any inciting event. Her exercise capacity and
level of activity have been limited over the past few months due
to progressive DOE.
On cardiac review of symptoms, patient denies any current or
prior chest pain/pressure/angina. Denies palpitations,
presyncope, and syncope. Patient does have [**1-19**] pillow orthopnea
with occasional PND. Lower leg swelling has not changed over
prior two months.

Currently, the patient notes fatigue and mild shortness of
breath at rest during the interview. She denies chest
pain/pressure, lightheadedness, and is otherwise asymptomatic.

Social History:
Patient is retired since [**2139**] from Met Life. She has been
divorced for many years. Currently not sexually active.
Admits to drinking alcohol rarely and has a 10 pack-year smoking
history (she quit 25 years ago). Denies illicit drug use. Says
she enjoys walking but has been limited by DOE more recently.
One son, 43yo, in good health, with 6 children, lives in [**Location (un) 5426**].

CXR: [**2146-11-3**]
A moderate right pleural effusion is largely unchanged. Linear
opacity adjacent to the effusion is most consistent with
atelectasis. There is improved aeration of the left lung base.
Upper lung zones are well aerated without new consolidation.
There is no pneumothorax. Pulmonary vascularity is normal. There
is no hilar enlargement. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is
grossly stable.

IMPRESSION:
Persistent moderate-to-large right pleural effusion and small
left pleural
effusion, with atelectasis. No edema

ECHO: [**2146-11-7**]
The left atrium is elongated. The estimated right atrial
pressure is 10-20mmHg. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and
cavity size are normal. There is severe global left ventricular
hypokinesis (LVEF = 20 %). No masses or thrombi are seen in the
left ventricle (fibrotic apical trabeculations are seen). The
right ventricular cavity is moderately dilated with severe
global free wall hypokinesis. [Intrinsic right ventricular
systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of
tricuspid regurgitation.] The aortic valve leaflets (3) are
mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Trace
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild to
moderate ([**11-19**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The left
ventricular inflow pattern suggests a restrictive filling
abnormality, with elevated left atrial pressure. The tricuspid
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The tricuspid valve
leaflets fail to fully coapt. Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid
regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. Significant pulmonic regurgitation is
seen. The end-diastolic pulmonic regurgitation velocity is
increased suggesting pulmonary artery diastolic hypertension.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a fat
pad.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2146-9-11**],
the right ventricular cavity is slightly larger with more severe
free wall hypokinesis. The other findings are similar.

Brief Hospital Course:
67 F with DM, 2 vessel CAD, CKD, and ischemic cardiomyopathy (EF
(20-25%) initially admitted with hyperglycemia after missing
insulin for several days.

With administration of home doses of insulin, hyperglycemia
corrected.  There was no evidence for an infection.  Hospital
course was then complicated by the development of hypotension
from decompensated CHF.  Although patient ruled out for an acute
ischemic event, echo showed progression of cardiac dysfunction
with an EF of 20%, 3+ tricuspid regurgitation and severe RV
dysfunction with free wall hypokinesis.  Transferred to the CCU
for further management and started on lasix and milironone drip
to optimize cardiac output.  CCU course complicated by the
development of PEA requiring cardiac resuscitation with
intubation and 4 pressor support.

Given the patient's end stage heart failure and prognosis, the
family decided to withdraw care.  A morphine drip was initiated
and pressors and mechanical ventilation was discontinued.  Time
of death was 4:30am on [**2146-11-10**].  Her son (next of [**Doctor First Name **]) and
niece [**Name (NI) 382**], declined an autopsy.
