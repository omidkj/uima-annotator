66 yo W w PMH of carotid artery disease s/p CVA [**2147**] and
multiple TIAs (approx 10 yrs ago), CAD s/p PCI, DM, afib on
coumadin and prior PE referred for admission for heparin therapy
prior to carotid artery intervention on Thurs [**3-21**]. Patient
reports recent onset of blurred, grey vision approximately 3
weeks a go that eventually resolved. Also endorses 1 episode of
"pins and needles" in both right and left hand as well as 2
episodes of trouble with balance in the last 1-2 weeks. She
attributes 2nd episode to getting out of her chair too quickly.

dizziness. Does admit family reports change in memory. No recent
CP and has not used SL nitro in [**7-9**] months.
.
Patient is on coumadin for afib and last dose was on Saturday.
.
Other review of systems notable for loose BMs, approximately [**5-7**]
per day which patient attributes to plavix. Also complains of
dark, black stool like "tar." Has had prior colonscopy with
polyp removal but per patient was overall "normal."

CT HEAD:
There is a coil mass noted in the expected location of the
basilar tip. This exerts considerable surrounding artifact which
limits evaluation. There is hypodensity noted in the left
putamen and internal capsule, which could be related to
age-indeterminate ischemia. No acute hemorrhage is seen within
limits of this examination.

There is intracranial vascular calcification of the cavernous
carotid arteries.

The ventricles and sulci are age appropriate.

Visualized paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are clear.

IMPRESSION:

No acute abnormalities.

Coil mass in the expected location of the basilar tip.

Mild sequela of prior ischemia in the left internal capsule.
.
Evaluation of the lung windows demonstrates left apical
scarring. Additionally, there appear to be mild nodularities in
the left lung posteriorly for which recommend correlation with
dedicated CT of the chest.
There are multiple mediastinal lymph nodes noted, which appear
to be slightly prominent in size. Please correlate with the CT
chest.
The right thyroid lobe appears to be absent, please correlate
with prior surgical history.

There is apparent nonvisualization of the right subclavian
artery beyond the takeoff of the cervical and costocervical
trunks. Recommend correlation with dedicated CTA of the chest.
There is extensive calcification of the aortic arch. There is
atheromatous plaquing of the aortic arch.

There is a calcified plaque at the origin of the right ICA, as
well as approximately 2 cm beyond the origin. There is
approximately 40% stenosis on the right. There is also large
calcified plaque in the left ICA at the origin with
approximately 50% stenosis. Evaluation of the right vertebral
artery demonstrates calcified plaque at the junction of the V1
and V2 segments which cause mild stenosis. There is some
calcified plaque in the left V2 segment of the vertebral artery
which causes mild stenosis.

Limited views through the brain demonstrate a probable coil mass
at the basilar tip. This examination does not assess for
residual aneurysm at the basilar tip.

IMPRESSION: Bilateral ICA origin stenosis as above

Possible stenosis of the right subclavian artery. Recommend
correlation with CTA of the chest.

Nodularities in the left lung apex, recommend correlation with
CT chest.


Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 66 yo F with prior CVA, PVD, a fib and prior PE admitted

carotid stenting. Known untreated left sided disease. Continued
aspirin, plavix and systemic anticoagulation. Unable to tolerate
statins.
.

BMs during admission
.
# Black stools. Chronic intermittent complaint. History of
polyps. Stools OB negative. HCT stable despite anticoagulation.
[**Month (only) 116**] need further eval as oupatient.
.
# PVD. Stable disease. Continued aspirin, plavix.
.
# Stable angina/CAD. Prior PCI but no recent need for SL nitro
and does not endorse angina on ambulation. Continued ASA,
plavix, betablocker.
.
# COPD. Stable. Continued home salmeterol.
.
# Prior PE. Systemic anticoagulation with heparin bridge to
coumadin
.
# Rhythm. Known A. Fib. NSR on admission. Systemic
anticoagulation with heparin bridge to coumadin.
.
# Tobacco use: Patient counselled on tobacco cessation. Given
nicotine patch but she continued to have cravings. Patient
directed to follow up with her PCP as she states she thinks she
is ready to quit.
.
# Anxiety: Continued on outpatient regimen but patient reports
still suffering from panic attacks. Encougaged patient to
discuss w PCP.
.
# Lung nodules: Noted to have lung nodularities on CTA neck.
Warrants further evaluation with CT chest in this long time
smoker. Contact[**Name (NI) **] PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] [**Last Name (STitle) **] regarding findings.
