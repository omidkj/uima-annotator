Brief Hospital Course:
On [**9-14**] she was admitted and went to the operating room where
revascularization was performed. Grafting  times 4 was done and
she weaned form bypass easily on low dose neosynephrine.  She
remained stable and was extubated easily.  Her neosysynephrine
weaned slowly on POD 1 and she was transferred to the floor.
Pain control was an issue due to her fibromyalgia. She resumed
her preoperative regimen and was comfortable.

While asleep her systolic BP fell into the 70s, although she
remained asymptomatic. She transferred back to the CVICU for
resumption of her neosynephrine.  Blood pressure stabilized, and
neo was weaned off.  The patient was transferred back to the
floor where she made excellent progress, showing good strength
and balance with physical therapy.  She did develop a bilateral
superficial phlebitis and complained of night sweats.  She
remained afebrile and white count remained normal.  She was
started on Keflex for this.  The patient did develop sinus
tachycardia and her lopressor was titrated appropriately.  ACE
inhibitor was held due to hypotension.  By the time of discharge
on POD 6, the patient was ambulating freely, the wound was
healing, and pain was controlled with oral analgesics.  She was
discharged to home with the usual post-op instructions and
follow-up.
