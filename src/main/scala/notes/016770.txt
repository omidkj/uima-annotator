Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2777**]
Chief Complaint:
Acute on chronic renal failure, decompensated heart failure

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
HD line placement

History of Present Illness:
66 year old woman with end-stage renal disease s/p deceased
donor renal transplant in [**2160**] who initially presented to [**Hospital 7912**] yesterday, [**10-25**] with hypoxia, acute renal
failure and congestive heart failure. Per patient's family, the
patient was appearing more short of breath and lethargic since
[**Holiday 1451**] day; she started using her home oxygen (1-1.5L)
throughout the day when she usually only uses it at night.
[**Name (NI) **] husband notes decreased urine output in the evenings
but same color, consistency. Patient and husband state she has
been compliant with her medications and has not noticed any
lower extremity edema.
.
Review of systems is otherwise negative. Patient denies
fevers/chills, nausea/vomiting, chest pain, palpitations,
orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, diarrhea/constipation,
gastrointestinal bleeding, changes in urine color/consistency.
.
At [**Hospital6 33**] (OSH), chest xray was consistent with
heart failure although patient did not appear volume overloaded.
She appeared more fluid overloaded on the second day of
hospitalization and BNP was 12,726. Patient responded minimally
to Lasix 40mg IV with 200mL of urine although pulmonary exam
improved. Cardiology felt she would benefit from a right heart
catheterization to establish volume status (if increased
pulmonary wedge pressure, should not overdiurese).
.
Given her elevated creatinine (from baseline), patient was given
gentle intravenous fluids but her creatinine continued to
increase. Urinalysis was only notable for 2+ protein (no casts)
and renal ultrasound was normal (no hydronephrosis in
transplanted kidney, incidental cholelithiasis with dilated
common bile duct, normal Doppler flow). Patient was given
erythropoiten 20,000 units per Renal consult recommendations
Given the concern for transplant failure in the setting of
rapidly advancing renal failure and other co-morbidities, she
was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for possible renal biopsy. In
anticipation of the renal biopsy, patient was started on a
heparin drip for atrial fibrillation, PTT>150 X3. Upon transfer,
patient was noted to have a BUN increased from 88 --> 93,
creatinine 3.9 --> 4.0 with hyperkalemia at 5.0 --> 4.8.
Hematocrit noted to have dropped to 24.8.

ECHO:

Conclusions
The left atrium is moderately dilated. No spontaneous echo
contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium or
left atrial appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or
color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size
are normal. There is severe regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction with basal and mid septal akinesia and apical
dyskinesia. The remaining left ventricular segments are
hypokinetic. The right ventricular cavity is moderately dilated
with moderate global free wall hypokinesis. The diameters of
aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. There
are three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
are mildly thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
moderately thickened. There is moderate thickening of the mitral
valve chordae. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate to
severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is no
pericardial effusion.

FINDINGS: The right-sided hemodialysis catheter tip is
satisfactorily in the cavoatrial junction. Elevation of the
right hemidiaphragm is chronic and seen on previous chest
radiographs back to [**2160**].
No consolidation, pneumothorax or pleural effusion, mild
perihilar haziness is slightly worse than on the previous study.


IMPRESSION:

Mild vascular congestion, no consolidation.


Brief Hospital Course:
Pt admitted on [**10-26**] for CHF and ARF in setting of transplanted
kidney with worsening rest pain and cool mottled right foot.

Pt originally on Medicine service. Pt has transplanted kidney.
Diagnosis of [**Last Name (un) **]. Oliguric. Creatine was at baseline 2.0. On
admission 4.1. also found to be hyponatremic. Documented Acute
on Systolic CHF.

Coumadin held for Afib.

[**Date range (1) 97686**]

Pt had TTE.

ECHO: The left atrium is elongated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is mild
regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with focal
akinesis of the mid to distal septum, distal inferior wall, and
apex. The remaining segments contract normally (LVEF = 45-50 %).
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with normal free
wall contractility. There is abnormal septal motion/position
consistent with right ventricular pressure/volume overload. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral
valve prolapse. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate [2+]
tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is severe pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Regional left ventricular dysfunction consistent
with multivessel CAD. Mild right ventricular cavity dilation.
Severe pulmonary hypertension. Moderate tricuspid and mitral
regurgitation

Tacrolimus, MMF, and prednisone continued.

Wound consult for heel ulcer.

Vascular Surgery Consulted. Heparin drip started. PTT followed.
