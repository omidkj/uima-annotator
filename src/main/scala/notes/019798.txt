History of Present Illness:
This is a [**Age over 90 **] yo man with Parkinson's and DM who was discharged
from [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2153-8-8**] s/p ORIF for right hip fracture, who was
doing well at rehab ([**Hospital **] healthcare center) until 2 weeks ago
when he started becoming somnolent, and was less engaged in
rehab activities. Pt was seen in ED on [**2153-8-24**] because of
hypoglycemia, where he was also noted to have a UTI. He was
given Levofloxacin in ED and discharged on 10-day course of
Ciprofloxacin. In addition, the patient was noted to have some
dysphasia with an "abnormal swallowing study at rehab".
.
The patient was seen by GI today for work-up of dysphasia where
he was noted to be somnolent, and apparently looked "awful" [**Name8 (MD) **]
MD. He was sent to the ED for further evaluation. On
presentation, he reported fatigue, loss of energy, confusion and
anorexia. His wife reports that the Rehabilitation facility
increased his Sinemet dose so that he has been receiving an
extra dose in the morning. His wife also reports that the
patient was reportedly fine and doing well at rehab for 1-2 days
until changing roommates, at which time he became increasingly
withdrawn and wanted to leave rehab. There was also a question
of possible verbal abuse from roommate.  He does have some mild
baseline dementia per wife, but was highly functioning (driving,
working in store, etc.) prior to his hip fracture.
.
The patient was unable to give much history. The majority of
information was obtained through wife and [**Name2 (NI) 8526**].

Brief Hospital Course:
Impression: [**Age over 90 **] yoM with Parkinson's, s/p ORIF sent from rehab
for change in mental status.

1. Change in mental status/delirium: Head CT negative for acute
pathology. A hypodensity present near stable parotid tumor,
therefore SPEP and UPEP sent. CXR showed patchy atelectasis zt
right lung base, but could not definitively rule out pneumonia,
therefore pat was started on levofloxacin, to complete a 7 day
course.  Had previously diagnosed with UTI, also treated by
levofloxacin. Serum tox and urine tox were all normal. VitB12
and TSH were normal. Electrolytes nl includign calcium. Pt was
not to be given benzo, while in hospital. Changed Sinemet back
to previuos dose, as it had been increased while in rehab, and
this may have precipitated delirium. Continued to have patient
OOB and PT. His mental status continued to improve.
.
2. Chronic Anemia- Baseline Hct of 26-29. Continued to monitor
for changes, without any significant change.
-
3. UTI- Cipro changed to Levofloxacin given atelectasis vs
possible pneumonia on CXR. This also covered UTI.
-
4. Dysphagia- reported dysphagia to solids but not liquids,
which would be consistent with a mechanical obstruction,
although pt is not a good historian. Pt placed on clear liquids,
obtained speech and swallow evaluation
-
5. FEN- Initally presented with hypovolemia secondary to
decreased PO intake, IV rehyrdation given in ED, and he was
placed on maintenance IV fluids. Patient had poor po intake
initally, stating that he ws not hungery. Continued on MVI and
Vit C, FS [**Hospital1 **] with RISS while in hospital. Electrolytes repleted
as needed.
-
7. Hip fracture- Continued PT while in hospital
-
8. Parkinson's- Given Sinemet 25/100 TID, and did not give
additional dose that he had been receiving since at rehab.
-
9.HTN- held HCTZ as BP were well controlled in hospital
-
10.Asthma- continued Combivent, Advair, singulair
.
11. Left heel pain: Patient complained of pain in L heel.
Obtained xray of L foot, which was negative for patholgy.
Elevated heel off bed with a pillow to decrease pressure on the
heel.
.
12. Prophylaxis- given Heparin SC, PPI, colace
.
13. Code - CMO; Pt code status switched to CMO.  On [**9-8**], pt
required constant norepinephrine/vasopressin to maintain MAP.
Pt. developed persistent hyponatremia; corrected partially with
3% NS.  Monrning of [**9-9**]; pt. family switched code status to CMO
and requested removal of ETT and pressors.  Pt. expired soon
after from respiratory arrest likely [**2-14**] complications related
to MRSA sepsis.
