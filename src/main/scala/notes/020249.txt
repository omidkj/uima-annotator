Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1835**]
Chief Complaint:
Unresponsiveness


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
R craniectomy for evacuation of clot [**2161-10-17**]
EVD placement [**2161-10-17**]


History of Present Illness:
This is a 30 year old right handed woman with history of HTN not
currently on medication who suddenly became unresponsive while
at a tailgate party with her husband.  [**Name (NI) **] husband, she was in
her usual state of health except for some
nighttime coughing.  She and her husband were at a tailgate
party and the patient went to grab some food.  She suddenly
grabbed her husband than muttered something about R side not
feeling right. She sat down and did not hit her head.  She soon
became unresponsive and 911 was called.

Per 911, she was unresponsive and possibly foaming at the mouth.
She was found to have dilated R pupil and she was emergently
transported to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED.  Her O2 sat was dropping into 80's
hence and she was not following any commands hence she was
emergently intubated in the ED.  Around intubation, she became
as
hypertensive as 240's/150's.

She underwent emergent imaging including CT of head and CTA of
head and neck which showed large R cortical/subcortical
hemorrhage with extensions into all ventricles and some midline
shift.  She was seen per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and was emergently taken to
the OR where she underwent R craniectomy.  She also received
100g of mannitol prior to the OR.

On Discharge: deceased

Pertinent Results:
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST [**2161-10-17**]
1. Status post right-sided craniectomy with post-surgical
pneumocephalus.
2. Partial right intraparenchymal hematoma evacuation. There is
residual
hematoma posteriorly within the site of intraparenchymal
hemorrhage.
3. Stable intraventricular blood extending into the lateral
ventricles and
the fourth ventricle.
4. New left frontal approach shunt catheter.
5. Stable ventricular size and midline shift.
6. Herniation with effacement of the quadrilateral plate.

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST [**2161-10-18**]
1. Status post right frontotemporal craniectomy with unchanged
appearance of blood products in the surgical bed, right basal
ganglia hemorrhage and
intraventricular hemorrhage.
2. Unchanged leftward shift of the normally midline structures
and mass effect compared to study performed earlier the same
day.

MRI brain [**10-19**]:
1. Unchanged large right intraparenchymal hemorrhage with new
foci of acute embolic infarctions scattered bilaterally
including the brainstem, cerebellum in bilateral frontoparietal
hemispheres.
2. Unchanged subfalcine and mild uncal herniation.
3. Unchanged foci of hemorrhage within the brainstem, in the
setting of
slight downward transtentorial herniation, raising the
possibility of duret hemorrhage

ECHO [**2161-10-20**]
Mild to moderate spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the left
atrial appendage. No mass/thrombus is seen in the left atrium,
left atrial appendage, right atrium, or right atrial. appendage.
The left atrial appendage emptying velocity is depressed
(<0.2m/s). No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is
seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is borderline (LVEF=
55 %). There is moderate LVH.No masses or thrombi are seen in
the left ventricle. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic
stenosis. No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve.
No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears
structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. No mass
or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve. No vegetation/mass is
seen on the pulmonic valve or the tricuspid valve. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: There is mild to moderate spontaneous echo contrast
in the left atrial appendage (and low emptying velocity) without
intracardiac thrombus seen (? Prior/recent atrial
fibrillaiton?). There is no evidence of vegetations or
abscesses. There is no ASD or PFO. There is no evidence of
aortic atheroma. There is moderate left ventricular hypertrophy
and the overall left ventricular systolic function is
borderline.

[**2161-10-19**]: LE doppler
 No evidence of DVT seen in either lower extremity.

[**2161-10-19**] Renal US
No gross hydronephrosis.

[**2161-10-21**] CT head
1. Stable to decreased hemorrhagic products within the right
cerebral
hemisphere and ventricular system, with no new hemorrhage.
2. Increased hypodensity in the right cerebral hemisphere
compatible with
evolving encephalomalacia.
3. Multifocal evolving left cerebral and brainstem infarcts.
4. Stable ventricular catheter. Stable effacement of the ambient
cisterns.
 Again demonstrated is the small hemorrhagic
focus in the paramedian ventral aspect of the upper pons; given
this pattern, in the setting of persistent downward
transtentorial herniation, this likely represents a Duret
hemorrhage, associated with a poor prognosis.

CXR [**2161-10-21**]
Now mild pulmonary edema has markedly improved. Mild-to-moderate
cardiomegaly is accentuated by low lung volumes. Bibasilar
opacity left greater than right are likely atelectasis. There is
no evident pneumothorax. The lines and tubes remain in place in
their standard position.

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2161-10-23**] 2:00 AM
Final Report
FINDINGS: Compared to the earlier examination, there is little
change in the appearance of a right frontoparietal craniectomy
with herniation of the brain to the calvarial defect. There are
extensive hemorrhagic products within the right cerebral
hemisphere, tracking into the lateral ventricles, the
distribution of which appears similar to the prior study. This
evaluation is limited by streak artifact from patient motion,
particularly in the posterior fossa. The appearance of the
posterior fossa, however, appears grossly similar with
effacement of the ambient cisterns. There is hemorrhage within
the brainstem, compatible with a hemorrhage. There are
multifocal low-attenuation lesions within the left cerebral
hemisphere compatible with evolving infarcts. A left frontal
approach ventriculostomy catheter is stable in position. The
visualized paranasal sinuses are clear.
IMPRESSION:
1. Little overall change in appearance of extensive right
cerebral
intraparenchymal hemorrhage with intraventricular extension.
2. Limited evaluation by streak artifact, but the appearance of
the posterior
fossa with brainstem hemorrhage, ambient cistern effacement and
downward
transtentorial herniation is unchanged.

CXR [**2161-10-23**]: IMPRESSION:
Progression of left lower lobe/retrocardiac opacity indicating
left lower lobe consolidation, possible additional right lower
lobe consolidation.
Pulmonary vascular engorgement and moderate cardiomegaly.







Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 30 y/o F with PMHx significant for HTN presents
unresponsive after a tailgate party. Patient stated that she did
not feel her R side, sat down, then became unresponsive. 911 was
contact[**Name (NI) **] and she was brought to [**Hospital1 18**]. She underwent emergent
CT and CTA which showed R SDH. She was taken to the OR
emergently and had
