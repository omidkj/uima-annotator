Penicillins / Ciprofloxacin / Lipitor / Erythromycin Base

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2474**]
Chief Complaint:
Hematuria

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Transurethral resection of bladder tumor

History of Present Illness:
84 y/o with a past history significant for [**Last Name (un) 3696**] syndrome
and hypothyroidism presented initially with vaginal bleeding.
Patient has known history of bladder cancer, diagnosed in [**2140**].
Pt presented after noticing bleeding starting on [**8-24**] and
progressively increasing over the next several days, with
associated fatigue and lethargy. She was intially admitted to
[**Hospital1 **] where abd CT showed pelvic  mass adjacent to bladder
and vagina. She has received 2 units PRBC's. Patient was noted
on the floor two days after admission, after having received 2u
pRBC, with hypertension to the 220s/100s, with decreased oxygen
saturations to mid-80s. She was transferred to the MICU for
management of flash pulmonary edema.  This resolved initially
with 10 IV Hydral,IV lopressor 5mg x2, nitro paste, 40 of lasix
(U/O 1L). She was noted in this setting to have demand ischemia
with increased ST dep in III, V5-6 compared to baseline with +
troponin elevation.
.
In the MICU she was stable, with continued hematuria. She
required 1U pRBCs on [**8-29**].  She was scheduled for an MRI to
further evaluate her pelvic mass and for RAS with labile blood
pressures, but was unable to complete the study [**1-14**] anxiety re:
noise. She is now transferred to the floor for further workup of
her bladder mass.
.
At baseline, she does not have SOB, has good exercise tolerance.
No h/o PND/orthopnea.


Past Medical History:
1. Hypertension
2. Hypothyroidism (last TSH [**2143-8-24**] 1.6)
4. Bladder mass existing since [**2137**]. Cytology positive for
urothelial neoplasia [**2143-6-27**]. Was scheduled for cystoscopy in
[**2143-3-14**] but did not follow up. Cystocopy with biopsy in
[**12/2140**] (no biopsy results available in OMR).
5. Coronary artery disease. Positive exercise stress test in
[**2138**] showing inferolateral ischemia.  She also had an
echocardiogram showing an ejection fraction of 55% without
wall motion abnormalities and 2+ mitral regurgitation in
[**2141**].
6. Multinodular goiter diagnosed in [**2139**] with US.
7. Bilateral small pulmonary nodules in a diffuse pattern seen
on chest CT in [**2141**] for which an etiology has not been
determined.
8. She also has a very mild ascending aortic aneurysm that
measures 3.8 x 3.6 cm seen on the same CT and a right
brachiocephalic aneurysm measuring 1.8 x 1.7 cm in [**2141**].
9. Depression
10. Hyperlipidemia ([**7-15**] CHOL 293, LDL 196, refusing lipid
lowering therapy).
11. Osteoporosis
12. DJD
13. Carpal tunnel syndrome
14. Chronic cough secondary to GERD
15. [**Hospital Ward Name 4675**] cyst

MRI abdomen: These images show hydronephrosis and hydroureter on
the right, with renal cortical thinning. There is a
circumferential mass seen at the posterior right side of the
bladder (in the region of the expected insertion of the right
ureter) through which the ureter runs. This mass measures
approximately 4.5 cm x 3.6 cm x 2.5 cm in size. There is a Foley
catheter within the bladder. Vagina is not clearly delineated on
these images; the uterus and adnexa are not identified.


Brief Hospital Course:
Assessment/Plan: 84 y/o F with history of bladder cancer
admitted with vaginal bleeding, transferred to the MICU in the
context of hypertensive urgency with hypoxia, with resultant
NSTEMI, now stabilized and transferred to the floor for further
workup of the bladder mass.  S/P TURBT.
.
1. Pelvic mass: Patient with h/o bladder cancer in [**2140**] now with
new mass on US and MRI. Need tissue dx and metastatic w/u.
Underwent TURBT with good improvement in hematuria. Foley
removed without incident, patient able to urinate.  Pathology
pending at time of discharge. To follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3748**] in
Urology for discussion of results.

2. ARF: Developed AIN with Bactrim during UTI treatment. Urine
eosinophils positive.  Creatinine improving during stay.
Encouraging po intake.  Also, mass covered part of right
ureteral insertion on trigone resulting in hydronephrosis.
.
3. HTN: Patient had episode of hypertensive urgency resulting in
flash pulmonary edema.  Per outpatient cardiologist, patient
non-compliant wtih meds, and refused studies for renal artery
stenosis.  Avoiding ace-inhibitors. Up-titrated Metoprolol to 50
mg po tid.  After the isolated episode, her blood pressure
remained well controlled.
.
4. CAD: Ms [**Known lastname 3271**] has a history of CAD and demand ischemia (ST
depression V5-6) in the setting of SBP 200's.  Repeat EKG after
resolution of HTN  urgency demonstrated resolved ST depressions.
Aspirin was avoided in the context of hematuria.  Questionable
history of allergy to Lipitor. In the hospital, she was given
low dose Lipitor, which she tolerated well.  On beta-blocker.

.
5. Hypothyroidism:  The patient has a history of hypothyroidism,
treated with levothyroxine. TSH checked in the hospital was
elevated at 7.4.  Dose increased to 100 mcg po qd.
.
6. Osteoporosis: Continued on home calcium and vitamin D
.
7. Oglivie's Syndrome: given a bowel regimen. Patient able to
have bowel movements in the hospital.
.
8. FEN: Maintained on a regular cardiac-healthy diet.  Sore
throat after intubation for TURBT, led to decreased po intake.
Cepacol lozenges with good effect. Advancing diet at time of
discharge to soft.
.
9. Full Code. No HCP.
