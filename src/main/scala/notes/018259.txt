History of Present Illness:
[**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 40718**] is an 83 yo female with morbid obesity, DMII,
diastolic CHF, asthma, and pemphigus folleacious, and a recent
20-day [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] admission for complex wound care for worsening skin
sloughing and bullae and severe pain, who is now transferred
back from rehab for hypoventilation in the setting of narcotic
administration. During her admission, her pemphigus skin lesions
were thought due to CMV/HSV with psuedomonal superinfection, and
she had chronic narcotic requirements (at one point was on
dilaudid PCA in ICU). She was d/c'ed to [**Hospital 100**] Rehab on [**5-22**]. Of
note, she was persistently hypothermic during her admission and
was d/c'ed to rehab with a temp of 92.9. Since that time, she
has continued to have lots of pain, possibly post-herpetic, with
all turns, movements, etc. Per her daughter, she has been
"getting too much pain medication." Today, with her turning and
cleaning in bed, she got 2mg IV dilaudid, then 2mg again. After
that she was noted to be hypopneic, altered/less responsive, and
was referred to ED.
.
In ED, VS: hypothermic to 85.8, 62, 138/78, 6, 100% on BiPAP.
Got 0.1mg narcan, with improvement in repsiratory rate to 18-20.
Lungs were noted to be wheezy, but no crackles were heard. She
was given a nebulizer treatment and solumedrol. CXR showed
stable mild cardiomegaly with increased perihilar opacities
reflecting volume overload and atelectasis. She complained of
difficulty breathing and was placed on BiPAP 14/4/100%. ABG on
these settings was 7.33/55/579, so FiO2 was decreased to 50%.
Shortly thereafter, her SBP briefly dropped down to 90s, and she
got 500cc bolus with reutn of BP's to 110s. EKG showed NSR at
70, NA/NI, diffuse TW flattening. No effusion was seen on
bedside ultrasound. CE's negative. Other labs showed normal WBC
count, stable anemia, and new thrombocytopenia to 109, as well
as renal insufficieny (Cr 1.3, was 0.7 on d/c, but by report has
CRI with baseline 1.3). Lactate was 3.6. Urine and blood
cultures were sent and she was given vancomycin 1g and
levofloxacin 750mg. Access is with her [**Hospital1 18**] PICC line. Most
recent VS: rectal temp 88 67 14 108/71 100% on BiPAP.
Hypothermia was only addressed later in her ED course, with plan
to begin warming down in ED and to check TSH.
