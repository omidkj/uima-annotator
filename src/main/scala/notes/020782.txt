History of Present Illness:
51 y/o F with PMH significant for ALS, asthma, lupus, and
rheumatoid arthritis admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**1-2**] with SOB. In
recent relevent history, pt was diagnosed with ALS in [**5-/2155**]
and has been followed for this at [**Hospital6 13753**].
Her PCP there is [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 100578**]. Pt has been admitted to [**Hospital1 112**] over
15 times since her ALS diagnosis. Following these admissions,
she most often goes to rehab, finishes her steroids, and then
returns to the hospital with SOB. Pt was most recently admitted
to [**Hospital1 112**] on [**12-22**] through [**12-29**] with cough and SOB. At that time,
her NIF was found to be 20 (baseline 25 to 30). She was treated
with aspiration PNA with levo and flagyl in addition to
prednisone 60 mg daily. The plan was for a slow steroid taper to
10 mg daily then continuing on this indefinetly. A pallitive
care consult was obtained during the [**Hospital1 112**] stay and the pt was
discharged to rehab with the plan to transition to an inpatient
hospice unit.

The pt was discharged from [**Hospital1 112**] to the Armonoiom House in JP on
[**12-29**]. Per the pt's neice, she was pushed by a staff member at
this facility on [**12-30**] and left without any medications as there
was difficulty in obtaining them. Once home, the pt had
increasing SOB and called EMS on [**1-1**] to be trasported to an
ED. As [**Hospital1 112**] was on divert she was transported to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED. In
the ED, her VS were 122/96  100  87% RA and 100% 4L NC. Pt was
initially admitted to a medicine service but following neurology
consultation and the finding of a NIF of 20 the pt was
transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for care. There, she received
levofloxacin, atrovent, morphine, and percocet.

Further issues with the pt include recent low grade fevers. She
has not had any sweats or recent weight changes. Pt has a
chronic cough with increasing sputum production. No CP,
tightness, or palpitations. No n/v, abdominal pain, or
constipation. Pt had diarrhea for for two days prior to
admission and reports three stools per day. No dysuria. Pt
reports that he knees have been swollen over the last few days.
She has also been experiencing left hip and back pain radiating
to her groin.

Speaking with the pt, she reports that she is doing fairly well
at this time. She does not feel SOB except with exertion. She is
able to cough out her sputum. Pt does have pain in her left hip
and back. She reports that he diarrhea is much improved.

Past Medical History:
1. [**Name (NI) **] Pt was diagnosed in [**5-10**] at [**Hospital1 112**]. Her baseline MIF is
-25 to -30. Pt is a known aspiration risk but declines trach and
PEG. She has significant and progressive bulbar symptoms and R
side weakness.
2. Asthma - Pt was intubated once in the past for her asthma.
PFTs are consistent with a restrictive physiology. She has had
multiple admissions since [**2152**]. Pulm consult at [**Hospital1 112**] thought she
had some reversible bronchoconstriction due to aspiration, poor
pulmonary reserve, obesity, and muscle weakness causing her
frequent resp decompensations.

Brief Hospital Course:
51 y/o F with PMH significant for ALS, asthma, lupus, and
rheumatoid arthritis admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**1-2**] with SOB.
.
1. [**Name (NI) 1621**] Pt had significant dyspnea on admission in addition
to cough, sputum production, and low grade fevers. Cause of her
symptoms are most likely multifactorial: Not taking medications
after leaving the rehab facility; asthma; recurrent aspirations
in the setting of ALS; and simply the neuromuscular compromise
of her ALS. Following a day of treatment in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], her
respiratory status is much more compensated and she is currently
comfortable.
- Completed course of antibiotics for aspiration PNA that was
initiated at [**Hospital1 112**]. This includes levofloxacin and flagyl through
[**1-5**]. EKG obtained and results noted above.  Steroid taper
initiated at 60 mg/d with plan for taper by 10 mg/q3-4 d to a
final dose of 10mg/day.  Treated with nebs/inhalers.  Treated
with BiPAP at night.
