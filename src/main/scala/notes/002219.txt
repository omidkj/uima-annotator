Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5018**]
Chief Complaint:
rapidly progressive weakness

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Trach placement


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 58941**] is a 75 year old man with hx of BPH, HTN,
depression and high cholesterol who presented yesterday evening
to [**Hospital6 2561**] with "inability to speak".  The history
is very limited because the patient was unable to talk and no
one
accompanied him to the hospital to relay the history.  From
information gathered at [**Hospital3 **], the patient was feeling OK
today until sometime this evening after eating dinner.  Time
course and exact contents of the meal are not known, but he
apparently communicated (in writing) that the food was homemade
and leftovers.  He arrived at [**Hospital3 **] at 7:30-8:00PM.
 Vitals on arrival were: BP 154/86 HR77 RR21 98%on RA.  While
there, could only say one or two words at a time-other details
of
initial exam not documented in available paperwork.  He had a
head CT which was negative.  Around 11:50PM, he vomited and was
given Zofran.  At 1:00AM, he wrote "please I need help, I think
I'm dying".  He was reassessed and seen by neurology at some
point.  He repeatedly wrote "I'm dying" on paper. He was noted
to
have "expressive aphasia" and bilateral ptosis. There was
apparently concern for "cortical stroke" vs. toxin ingestion
such
as botulism.  He was then transfered here for further evaluation
and MRI.


Past Medical History:
1. HTN
2. Depression
3. BPH
4. High cholesterol

Was hospitalized at [**Hospital3 **] in [**9-8**] for hyponatremia (?SIADH
from SSRIs) and failure to thrive. At that time he was noted to
have hx of weight loss in the past year of 20-25lbs


Social History:
-lives in [**Hospital1 8**] by himself
-Muslim
-no tobacco or etoh use as per son


Family History:
No known family history of neurologic disease as per son.

Physical Exam:
Gen: Thin, gaunt appearing male, in significant respiratory
distress +accessory muscle use
Neck: supple, no thyromegaly, no bruit
CV: Tachy, regular 2/6SEM
Lung: Clear to auscultation bilaterally
aBd: decreased BS soft, nontender
ext: no edema
Neurologic examination:
Mental status: Awake and alert, Oriented to person, place, and
time.  He was unable to speak,though occasionally grunted.
Occasionally mouthed some words.  Tried to communicate with
gestures, very frustrated by inability to communicate.
Comprehension appeared intact-could follow commands, cross
midline.  Unable to repeat or name.  No evidence of apraxia or
neglect. Respiratory distress prohibited further mental status
testing.

Cranial Nerves:
Pupils equally round and reactive to light, 3 to 2mm
bilaterally.
+blink to threat from both directions.  Eyes were midline and
conjugate on neutral gaze.  +vertical gaze palsy (unable to look
up or down at all), bilateral abducens palsy.  Bilateral ptosis.
Facial diplegia. Hearing grossly intact. Palate elevation
symmetrical. Gag absent. Unable to move tongue, no
fasciculations
observed.

Motor:
Normal bulk bilaterally. Tone slightly increased in lower
extremities.  Occasional fasciculations observed in left quad.
No
pronator drift.

Chest CT [**2112-2-11**]:
FINDINGS: The endotracheal and gastric tubes are in satisfactory
position. There are no pathologically enlarged axillary, hilar,
or mediastinal lymph nodes. There is a 5-mm rounded density,
which is ill-defined, in the right upper lobe. There are
multiple other smaller ill-defined densities adjacent to this.
There are opacities in both lung apices, which could represent
pleural thickening or scarring. There is patchy air space
disease within the right lower lobe, with endobronchial spread.
There is also airspace disease of the right middle and left
lower lobes. There is calcification of the aortic arch and
descending aorta. The heart, pericardium and great vessels
otherwise are unrmarkable.
The stomach is full of ingested material.
Limited views of the upper abdomen show an unremarkable, liver,
gallbladder, spleen, and upper pole of the kidneys.

BONE WINDOWS: No suspicious osteolytic or sclerotic lesions.

IMPRESSION:
Airspace disease within the left lower lobe, right lower lobe,
and right middle lobes, consistent with infection. Aspiration
cannot be excluded.

EMG [**2112-2-11**]
Complex, abnormal study. The electrophysiologic findings are
consistent with a neuromuscular transmission disorder, with
evidence for pre- synaptic dysfunction and widespread fiber
blocking, as seen in botulism.

The differential diagnosis includes other pre-synaptic
neuromuscular
transmission disorders (e.g., [**Location (un) **] [**Location (un) **] myasthenic
syndrome); however, the rapidly progressive clinical picture and
pronounced ophthalmoplegia are atypical for this.


Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted for management of his weakness.  He was
intubated in the ER for respiratory distress and transferred to
the ICU.  Subsequent blood testing revealed botulism toxin in
his blood.  Approximately 24 hours after admission the patient
received the anti-toxin from the CDC flown in from [**Location (un) 9012**],
[**State 3908**].  Over the course of this admission, the patient
developed a pneumonia that was treated with a 7 day course of
unasyn (although it is likely this pneumonia was more of a
chemical pneumonitis as he was given activated charcoal prior to
admission and may have aspirated).

He also suffered from gastroparesis requiring frequent enemas,
nutritional supplementation with TPN, and an aggressive bowel
regimen.  He was given several doses of neostigmine with the
hopes of improving bowel motility but he did not pass any
significant materail.  He can continue TPN indefinitely until
bowel has fully recovered per nutrition consult.  PICC line
placed on [**2112-2-20**] with tip in the distal SVC.

His ocular weakness has improved in that he is able to move his
eyes from side to side a bit, although still unable to open eyes
(bilateral ptosis).  He remains with good distal extremity
muscle strength in the arms and legs, but poor proximal muscle
strength, unable to lift any extremity off the bed.  He remains
on the ventilator with a trach collar.  He is now being
discharged to rehab, afebrile and in stable condition but
requiring continued aggressive PT.

Note:  He is completely awake and alert and can answer questions
using his hands.  He is unable to open his eyes due to weakness
of his eyelids.  This patient would benefit from speech therapy
and development of creative ways of communication (like pointing
to pictures when he wants to express something he wants, etc.)

He should undergo periodic trials of CPAP and pressure support
vent settings to see if he has regained his ability to breath
without the use of the vent.

He should also have aggressive PT/OT and range of motion
exercises.
