Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1167**]
Chief Complaint:
unresponsiveness/s/p cardiac arrest

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
intubation
therapeutic hypothermia protocol

History of Present Illness:
73M with h/o severe cardiomyopathy (EF [**9-19**]) s/p biV/ICD
([**2115**]),  afib on coumadin and dig, rheumatic heart disease s/p
mitral valve repair in [**2109**] with residual 3+ MR, CRI, h/o CVA,
who was found unresponsive on park bench s/p cardiac arrest and
loss of pulse during EMS transport on way to [**Hospital1 18**] ED.
.
Complex story pieced together with family report, ED records,
OMR, and info from ICD interrogation. Per OMR note, patient had
increasing LE edema since 6 days PTA, called Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 437**] and was
told to restart lasix 20mg [**Hospital1 **]. Per family report, patient had
not been feeling well for 2 days PTA with fatigue, vague
symptoms. On AM of admission, pt had ICD firing for sensed VT at
11am with LOC prior to shock, with  episode of incontinence. Pt
called Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 437**] at 2pm who thought that patient may be
hypokalemic, told to take 40meq KCL with planned f/u in [**Hospital 3782**]
clinic. Patient then went to park to meet friends with possible
marijuana use (?laced with cocaine) and was found unresponsive
on park bench for unknown amt of time and EMS called.
.
No EMS records, but per ED report, pt had loss of pulse in
transport, was given seconds of chest compressions, and on
arrival in ED at 5:20pm, was in pulseless wide complex
tachycardia concerning for polymorphic VT. CPR commenced and pt
given epi 1mg x 1, atropine 1mg x 1, and intubated (initial gas
7/16/32/189), femoral line placed. During course in ED, patient
went in and out of pulseless VT/WCT (loss of pulse for minutes
at a time) requiring intermittent shocks by ICD (x 5 shocks per
ICD interrogation between 4:46pm and 5:39pm), external
defibrillation, and medications (amiodarone, epi, vasopressin,
atropine). When regained pulse, pt hypotensive (SBP 36-67/26-29)
so pt started on Neosynephrine and Levophed. Labs significant
for INR 4.4, Hct 28.2, Cr 1.2, K 2.8. Given 30mg IV KCL, 2mg Mag
sulfate, and given Hct drop from b/l of 32-35, sent for CT head
for concern of bleed in setting of elevated INR. Wet read of CT
head with no bleed, mass effect, or shift. Also given 4amps of
Digibind after labs drawn. Patient lost pulse while down at CT
scan, required one round of epi/atropine/CPR and regained pulse
after 3 min, and was sent up to CCU directly on Neosynephrine at
4.8 and Levophed at 2.6.
.
On arrival to CCU, patient was intubated, sedated with fentanyl
and versed. Met with family for update, identification, and
confirmed full code. Overnight, Arctic sun cooling protocol
initiated, reached goal temperature at 8:30pm. Started on
dopamine, levophed and neosynephrine weaned off. ICD
interrogated showing 6 episodes of ATP/shock for sensed VT/VF.
Bedside ECHO done showing no large change from prior. ECG showed
v-pacing and resolution of global WCT in limb leads, continued
to have ACT in precordial leads with changed morphology from old
ECG. Repeat ABG was 7/22/45/70, PEEP increased to 10. Cr
increased from 1.2-> 1.9, INR decreased to 3.3, K was 5, lactate
was 5.6. Given 20mg IV lasix with no response, then 40mg IV x 1
for volume overload by exam, CXR, no UOP ->50cc urine output.
BNP [**Numeric Identifier **]. Cardiac arrest team notified, patient enrolled in IV
steroid clinical trial with family consent.
.
Unable to obtain review of systems as patient unresponsive. Per
OMR, patient with recent increase in LE edema.

Pertinent Results:
EKG: Multiple EKGs, 1723 - 1745 in ED. Rate ranged from 83 - 150
highly irregular polymorphic wide complex tachycardia. With
pacer spike occasionally prior to QRS complex and occasionally
within QRS complex. Multiple QRS morphology. EKG from 1744,
shows possible concordance in precordial leads. [**2043**] on arrival
to CCU, EKG compared to prior EKG prior negative deflection in
V3 now positive.
.
2D-ECHOCARDIOGRAM: [**8-11**]
1.The left atrium is moderately dilated. The left atrium is
elongated. The right atrium is moderately dilated.
2.There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular cavity is severely dilated. There is severe global
left ventricular hypokinesis. Resting regional wall motion
abnormalities include akinesis of the mid and distal septum, mid
and distal inferior wall and apex. The remaining segments are
severely hypokinetic. The remaining left ventricular segments
are hypokinetic.
3. Right ventricular systolic function appears depressed. There
is an echogenic density in the RV consistent with a pacemaker
lead.
4.The aortic root is mildly dilated. The ascending aorta is
mildly dilated. The aortic arch is mildly dilated.
5.The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with
good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. 6.The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate to severe (3+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. The left ventricular inflow
pattern suggests a restrictive filling abnormality, with
elevated left atrial pressure.
7.There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
8.There is no pericardial effusion.

CARDIAC CATH:  [**6-8**]
  1. Selective coronary angiography showed a right dominant
system
without evidence for angiographically significant stenoses.
  2. Limited resting hemodynamics revealed moderate pulmonary
hypertension (PA mean 39 mmHg). The right and left sided filling

pressures were elevated (RA mean 18 mmHg, RVEDP 20 mmHg, PCW
mean 24
mmHg). Cardiac output and index were reduced (CO 3.5 l/min, CI
1.7
l/min/m2).
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Coronary arteries are normal.
2. Elevated left and right sided filling pressures
3. Moderate pulmonary hypertension.
