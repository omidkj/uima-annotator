History of Present Illness:
74 yo male who developed chest pain radiating to back at 5 PM on
night prior to admission to OSH.  Pt took Tums and woke up the
next morning with worsening chest pain. Pt was given 2 ASA and

have new BBB. He was placed on heparin and NTG and tx'd to [**Hospital1 18**]
for cath. CTA was done to rule out diseection, trop 0.31 on
admission, increased to 0.79.  Pt was loaded with 300 mg plavix.
Cath revealed 50% LM dz, severe 3 V CAD.  Pt has hx 10 years of
chest pain, relieved with rest and heat.

 [**Hospital1 18**] ECHOCARDIOGRAPHY REPORT
Echocardiographic Measurements
Results  Measurements  Normal Range
Left Ventricle - Ejection Fraction:  45% to 50%  >= 55%
Findings
LEFT ATRIUM: No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the LAA.
RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Normal interatrial septum.
LEFT VENTRICLE: Mildly depressed LVEF.
RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.
AORTA: Simple atheroma in ascending aorta. Complex (>4mm)
atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets.
TRICUSPID VALVE: Physiologic TR.
PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: No PR.
PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.
GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify I was present in compliance with HCFA
regulations. The patient was under general anesthesia throughout
the procedure. The TEE probe was passed with assistance from the
anesthesioology staff using a laryngoscope. No TEE related
complications.
REGIONAL LEFT VENTRICULAR WALL MOTION:
     N = Normal, H = Hypokinetic, A = Akinetic, D = Dyskinetic
Conclusions
Emergency CABG for unremitting ischemia, s/p failed IABP
placement.The patient was planned to have off-pump CABG because
of extensive aortic atherosclerosis. The patient did not
tolerate it and failed with severe ischemia demonstrated by
hypotension, bradycardia and low Sp-O2. CABG proceeded on-pump.
Prior to the failed attempt at OP-CABG:
No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the left atrial
appendage.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed
(LVEF= 45 - 50%). Septal, anterior septal and apical segments
are hypokinetic.
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
There are simple atheroma in the ascending aorta.
There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending thoracic
aorta.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Post-CPB:
The patient is on low-dose Epi and NTG, and is AV-Paced.
Preserved biventricular systolic fxn. EF remains 45 - 50%. Good
RV fxn.
Trace MR, trace AI.
Aorta intact.
  I certify that I was present for this procedure in compliance
with HCFA regulations.

========================================================

Brief Hospital Course:
He was transferred from an outside facility for emergent cardiac
catheterization and chest CTA on [**9-30**]. Cardiac cath revealed
LMain and 3VD with preserved EF. He ruled in for non ST
elevation myocardial infarction with peak troponin 0.57 and CTA
revealed no aortic dissection or PE. Additionally he was noted
to have incarcerated hernia vs bowel obstruction and a general
surgery consult was called. His hernia was manually reduced.
Post cath he continued to have chest pain, the cardiology team
attempted an intra aortic balloon pump placement but were
unsucessful and he was brought emergently to the operating room
for coronary artery bypasss grafting. Please see OR report for
details. He tolerated the operation and was transferred to the
cardiac surgery ICU for hemodynamic managment.  Once in the ICU
his cardiac indicies were poor and his inotropes were changed
from Epinephrine to Milrinone, he stabilized but was kept
sedated over the next 36 hours. On POD2 diuretics were begun and
he was extubated, following extubation his inotropes were weaned
to off. He became febrile and sputum gm stain revealed gm
poitive cocci and rods and negative rods, he was started on
appropriate antibiotics. He remained in the ICU to monitor his
pulmonary status. On POD5 he was transferred to the stepdown
floor for continued post-op care. The remainder of his hospital
stay was uneventful and on POD day eight he was ready for
discharge to rehab for completion of antibiotic course for
treatment of pneumonia.
