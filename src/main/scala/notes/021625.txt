History of Present Illness:
patient is a 64 yo M with atrial fibrillation on coumadin, [**Hospital 2182**]
transferred from an OSH with respiratory distress due to
supraglottic edema. He initially presented to [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]
because he was 'spitting up blood' after eating a [**Location (un) 6002**] at
his rehab. He was found to have supraglottic edema both on exam
and in CT scan. He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for airway
management. Surgery was called for respiratory distress in the
ED and performed an emergent crichothyroidotomy in the OR. ENT
was consulted and changed the crich to a tracheostomy. Admission
labs pertinent for Hct of 50 (down to 33 on transfer) and INR of
3.0 reversed with 6 [**Location 16678**] and 10 mg vitamin K (given at OSH)
down to 1.6.

HEENT: Sclera anicteric, MMM, oropharynx clear
Neck: supple, JVP not elevated, no LAD
Lungs:  slight expiratory wheeze with otherwise clear breath
sounds
CV: distant HS, tachycardic, irregular, normal S1 + S2, no
murmurs, rubs, gallops
Abdomen: soft, TTP in LUQ and LLQ, non-distended, bowel sounds
present, no rebound tenderness or guarding; bruises noted over
bilateral lower quadrants. no abdominal rash noted.

Ext: limbs cool to touch BL with 1+ DPs, PTs bilaterally; hair
loss. Moving all lower and upper extremities to command.

Pertinent Results:
Images:
CXR ([**9-9**]) - FINDINGS: AP single view of the chest has been
obtained with patient in semi-upright position. Image field
directed towards upper abdomen on purpose so to identify
Dobbhoff line which is seen to be located in stomach pointing
towards pylorus and duodenum but not having passed of yet. No
other remarkable findings. This image has been obtained to
complement a previous chest examination obtained two hours
earlier.
.
CT neck (OSH on [**8-31**]):
Impression: Edema of the epiglottis, the R lateral oropharynx
and the hypopharynx. No discrete abscess. Mild narrowing of the
supraglottic airway.  Diffuse R maxillary sinusitis.
CT neck ([**9-6**])
IMPRESSION:
1. Significant decrease in right supraglottic edema since
[**2146-8-31**]. While no definite underlying mass is seen, a mass is
difficult to exclude.
2. Numerous lymph nodes at levels 1, 2 and 3, right greater than
left, not pathologically enlarged by CT size criteria. These may
be reactive.
3. Near-complete opacification of the paranasal sinuses, which
may be related to the known nasal packing.
4. 1 cm cystic lesion with wall calcifications in the left
vallecula.  Recommend direct visualization, when feasible.
  .
CT Chest ([**9-1**])
FINDINGS:
.
The patient is intubated through tracheostomy. For precise
evaluation of the neck and the area of the glottis, please
review CT of the neck obtained the same day and the
corresponding report. A central venous line terminates at the
cavoatrial junction. Pacemaker leads terminate in right atrium
and right ventricle. Aorta and pulmonary arteries are normal in
diameter. Heart size is normal. There is no pericardial
effusion. Extensive coronary calcifications are present.
.
The evaluation of the airways demonstrate patent trachea, right
and left main bronchi as well as the upper lung lobe and right
middle lobe bronchial tree.  Within the lower lobe, there are
bibasal consolidations, with air bronchogram on the right and
minimal air bronchogram on the left. Giving their relatively
high enhancement, they most likely represent areas of
atelectasis, but bibasilar infectious process cannot be excluded
and it is accompanied by small amount of pleural effusion. The
upper lungs are essentially clear. Severe emphysema is involving
the upper lobes, a combination of centrilobular and panlobular
type.
.
The imaged portion of the upper abdomen demonstrates small
degree of ascites.  Sludge within the gallbladder is noted, but
with no evidence of cholecystitis. The pancreatic duct is
dilated up to 9 mm, the reason is unclear, and the pancreas is
partially imaged. Significant lymphadenopathy is noted in the
area of the celiac trunk bifurcation up to 14 mm, and might
reflect both  neoplastic or infectious etiology. Adrenals,
imaged portion of the kidneys,
spleen, and imaged portion of the liver are unremarkable.
.
Extensive degenerative changes are present in the spine, but
there are no lytic or sclerotic lesions worrisome for neoplasm
or infection. Lateral view demonstrates wedge compression
fracture of upper lumbar vertebral body, chronicity
undetermined.
.
EGD ([**2146-9-9**]):
Findings: Esophagus:  Mucosa: Abnormal mucosa was noted
throughout the esophagus. There was 3 inches of circumferential
dark mucosa starting at the GE junction. Proximal to that in the
distal and mid esophagus there are patchy areas of dark mucosa.
This persists despite lavage. it has an ischemic appearance, and
most consistent with ischemic injury. There is also evidence of
punctate and patchy erythema consistent with esophagitis.
Stomach:  Mucosa: Patchy discontinuous erythema of the mucosa
with no bleeding was noted in the whole stomach. These findings
are compatible with gastritis.
Duodenum: Normal duodenum.
Impression: Abnormal mucosa in the esophagus
Erythema in the whole stomach compatible with gastritis
Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum
Recommendations: Would check H. Pylori serologies and treat if
positive.
Continue PPI [**Hospital1 **].
