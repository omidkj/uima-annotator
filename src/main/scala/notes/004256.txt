Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 689**]
Chief Complaint:
Rectal bleeding

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Colonoscopy
Esophagogastroduodenoscopy


History of Present Illness:
87 yo F with h/o CAD, A fib on coumadin, HTN, hyperchol,
hypothyroidism p/w melena. Pt notes that for the past 2.5 weeks
she has been "run down with the flu," principally with symptoms
of malaise and poor appetite. Two days ago the pt noted the new
onset of black stools, described as "clots", passed with large
amounts of flatus. She was concerned that this was blood and
went to her PCP's office today. He did a rectal exam and in turn
referred her to the ED. Other than the melena, she denies any
frank blood. She had one episode of NB/NB vomitous one week but
no hematemesis. She denies CP/SOB/f/c/urinary sxs. Of note, pt
has had recent changes in her coumadin dose over the past 2
weeks though is unsure of doses.
.
In the ED, vitals: 97.6, hr 77, 181/64, rr 18, 95% ra. Hct 32
(baseline 38). wbc 16.9. INR 7.2. lactate 1.3. Lytes nml. U/A
6-10 wbcs. ekg: nsr@77bpm, LAD, no ishcemic changes. Pt given
vit K 10 mg po x 1, zosyn 4.5 grams iv, flagyl 500 grams iv. Pt
transferred to MICU for further management.
.
In the MICU, the patient received 2units FFP, HCTs remained
stable. GI evaluated and felt that an EGD was non-urgent and
will be done on Monday.

CXR:
The heart size is normal. The aorta is tortuous and there is
calcification within the aortic knob. Ill-defined densities
noted within the right lung base. Questinable nodular densities
are scattered through out both lungs. The left retrocardiac
density corresponds to the hiatal hernia and appears unchanged
compared to the prior study. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax
is detected. The soft tissue and osseous structures are
unremarkable.

IMPRESSION:
Right basilar infiltrate is suggestive of peumonia.
Equivocal densities scattered through out both lungs need
further evaluation by nonurgent chest CT.

CT Abd/Pelvis:
 Innumerable nodules measuring up to 13 mm in diameter are seen
in the imaged portion of the lung bases. The imaged portion of
the heart and pericardium appear unremarkable. Several enlarged
lymph nodes, some with hypodense centers, are seen in the
pericardial fat measuring up to 15 mm in diameter. Several
peripherally located heterogeneously hypodense lesions are seen
about the right and left lobes of the liver in subserosal
location consistent with metastases. The largest of these, in
the right lobe (2:14), measures 2.6 cm in diameter. Numerous
additional nodular and irregular foci involve the peripheral
aspects of segments V, VI, IVb and [**Doctor First Name 690**].

At the gastric fundus, a heterogeneous mass measures 3.4 x 2.6
cm and protrudes into the lumen (2:18).

Numerous enlarged lymph nodes and mesenteric masses are seen
throughout the entire abdomen. Two confluent omental masses
anteriorly (2:44) measure up to 6.1 cm in diameter. Numerous
additional mesenteric lymph nodes as well as retroperitoneal
nodes along the celiac axis and in aortocaval and paraaortic
location have hypodense centers consistent with central
necrosis. These are located in the omentum anteriorly (2:27), in
the lesser sac (2:27), adjacent to the spleen and along the left
lateral peritoneum (2:27, 21), and throughout the mesenteric
root (2:45). The pancreatic duct is nondilated and no definite
pancreatic masses are identified. The adrenal glands are mildly
nodular appearing although no definite masses are identified.
Bilateral hypodense renal lesions are too small to characterize.
There is no hydronephrosis. The aorta is normal in caliber with
mural calcification consistent with atheromatous disease. A
serosal mass involving the descending colon (2:60) measures 3.5
x 3.3 cm. The colon is displaced in multiple other locations by
multiple omental and serosal masses. There is no evidence of
bowel obstruction.

CT PELVIS WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: A heterogeneous centrally
hypodense mass spans the width of the lower abdomen and pelvis,
tethering the terminal ileum and cecum as well as the sigmoid
colon, and is contiguous with the uterus and adnexa. Overall,
this mass measures up to 14 cm in greatest transaxial dimension.
The sigmoid colon is extensively encased. The bladder contains
gas, and the dome of the bladder just touches the confluent
pelvic mass. Additional nodular implants are seen in the
rectovaginal cul-de-sac (2:78).

BONE WINDOWS: No definite lesions worrisome for osseous
metastatic disease are identified. There is lumbar scoliosis and
degenerative change.

IMPRESSION:

1. Innumerable omental and peritoneal masses throughout the
abdomen and pelvis, with the largest confluent mass in the deep
pelvis.

2. 3.4 x 2.6 cm gastric fundal mass.

3. Pulmonary metastases.

4. Serosal hepatic metastases.

5. Encasement of the uterus and sigmoid colon, and questionable
involvement of the bladder, by the conglomerate pelvic mass. No
evidence of bowel obstruction.

6. Air within the bladder. Please correlate with any possible
history of recent Foley catheterization.

Possible etiologies for the extensive metastatic disease could
include gastric cancer with metastases, versus other
gastrointestinal primary with metastases, or ovarian cancer.
Clinical correlation is recommended.

COLON BIOPSIES:
Proximal sigmoid colon mass, biopsy:

Colonic mucosa with chronic active inflammation.
No neoplasm seen.
Multiple levels have been examined.
Note: Possible causes include compression from an external
lesion or an intrinsic chronic colitis.

EGD:
Normal mucosa within the esophagus, stomach and duoenum. No sign
of gastric mass.

Colonoscopy:
Partially obstructing mass noted in the proximal sigmoid colon
(40cm) covered by normal appearing mucosa. Unable to pass scope
further.


Brief Hospital Course:
GI bleed: The patient intitially presented with a GI bleed.
Based on the presentation of more maroon stool than melena, it
was fe
