Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1899**]
Chief Complaint:
syncope

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac catheterization with no intervention


History of Present Illness:
58 year old female with history of DM, HTN, tobacco abuse, and
h/o CHF who presented to OSH on [**2187-12-12**] with 2 days of
nonproductive cough and worsening SOB.
.
Family reports that patient started to complain of SOB a week
prior to presentation. On [**2187-12-12**], she became unconscious
shortly after coming out of the shower. EMS was called, and on
arrival patient was responsive but gradually became unresponsive
en route to the ED. She was given 40mg IV lasix by EMS.
.
On presentation to OSH she was in respiratory distress with HR
in the 140s, SBP > 200 and afebrile. She was started on a Nitro
gtt, and intubated. CXR showed pulmonary edema. EKG initially
showed sinnus tachycardia, left atrial enlargement, and inferior
apical ST abnormalities. Subsequent EKG showed sinus thythm with
nonspecific ST abdnormalities and T-wave inversions. Initial
troponins were elevated at 0.26. She was given ASA, lipitor,
metoprolol, and started on heparin gtt. She was transferred to
the ICU and aggressively diuresed. Respiratory status improved
and she was extubated on 1/[**2187**].
.
Echocardiogram done at OSH hospital showed thickened Aortic
valve without stenosis, mild AI, and thickened mitral valve
leaflets with severe MR. She was also noted to have concentric
LVH with normal chamber dementions, normal RV, and small
pericardial effusion without tamponade phyiology. EF was 70%.
She was treated briefly with antibiotics for leukocytosis, but
these were discontinued when no source was found. Nitro gtt was
stopped on [**2187-12-14**] and she was transferred for further
evaluation.
.
Upon arrival to [**Hospital1 18**] she was taken to the cath lab where she
was noted to have total occlusion of the distal RCA with L>R
collaterals, was also 60% stenosis of the OM2(LCX), otherwise no
significant CAD. Hemodynamic measurements were notable for RA
pressure 14, RV 55/8(16), PCW 33, PA 55/32 (44), LV 147/12,
LVEDP 27, Ao 147/80. She was transferred to the CCU with stable
vital signs.
.
On review of systems, she denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. She denies recent fevers, chills or
rigors. She denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the
other review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema,
palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

ECHO [**12-14**]:
No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of
the left atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of the right
atrium/right atrial appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen
by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular chamber size is normal.
There is inferobasal thinning/aneurysm. The remaining segments
contract normally. No intraventricular thrombus is seen. There
are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. No masses or
vegetations are seen. A central jet of mild (1+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are normal.
There is no systolic prolapse or mass/vegetation seen. Severe
(4+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets
are normal. No vegetation or mass is seen. There is no
pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Severe mitral regurgitation with normal mitral valve
morphology. [**Month/Year (2) 55694**] inferior left ventricular aneurysm. Mild
aortic regurgitation without discrete vegetation. Simple
atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
.
[**12-14**]: cardiac catheterization:
COMMENTS:
1. Coronary angiography in this right-dominant system
demonstrated
one-vessel disease. The LMCA had no angiographically apparent
disease.
The LAD was a large wrap-around vessel supplying most of the
inferior
wall and had no angiographically apparent disease. The LCx had a
60%
stenosis in its second obtuse marginal branch. The RCA had a
distal
total occlusion with left-to-right collaterals.
2. Resting hemodynamics revealed moderately elevated right-sided
filling
pressures and severely elevated left-sided filling pressures,
with an
RVEDP of 16 mm Hg and a PCWP of 33 mm Hg. There was moderate
pulmonary
arterial systolic hypertension, with a PASP of 55 mm Hg. The
cardiac
index was depressed at 1.8 L/min/m2. There was mild systemic
arterial
hypertension. There was no gradient upon pullback of the
catheter from
the left ventricle to the aorta.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. One-vessel and [**Last Name (un) **] vessel coronary artery disease.
3. Severe elevation of left sided filling pressures consistent
with
severe mitral regurgitation.
.
Renal ultrasound [**12-19**]: Preliminary Report !! PFI !!
1. Abnormal arterial parvus tardus waveforms involving the left
kidney with
slightly elevated flow velocities in the proximal main left
renal artery
suggestive of underlying renal artery stenosis. This can be
confirmed with a CTA or MRA.
