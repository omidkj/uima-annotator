Findings
LEFT ATRIUM: Marked LA enlargement. No spontaneous echo contrast
or thrombus in the LA/LAA or the RA/RAA. Good (>20 cm/s) LAA
ejection velocity.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: A catheter or pacing wire is
seen in the RA and extending into the RV. No ASD by 2D or color
Doppler.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Wall thickness and cavity dimensions were
obtained from 2D images. Normal LV wall thickness. Normal LV
cavity size. Normal regional LV systolic function. Low normal
LVEF. [Intrinsic LV systolic function likely depressed given the
severity of valvular regurgitation.]

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV systolic function.

AORTA: Normal aortic diameter at the sinus level. Focal
calcifications in aortic root. Normal ascending aorta diameter.
Simple atheroma in descending aorta.

AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS.
No AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Moderately thickened mitral valve leaflets.
Myxomatous mitral valve leaflets. Partial mitral leaflet flail.
Mild mitral annular calcification. No MS. Eccentric MR jet.
Severe (4+) MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Tricuspid valve not well visualized. Moderate
[2+] TR.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Pulmonic valve not well seen.
Physiologic (normal) PR.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify I was present in compliance with HCFA
regulations. The patient was under general anesthesia throughout
the procedure. No TEE related complications. The patient appears
to be in sinus rhythm. The rhythm appears to be atrial
fibrillation. Results were personally reviewed with the MD
caring for the patient.
Conclusions
PRE CPB The left atrium is markedly dilated. No spontaneous echo
contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium/left
atrial appendage or the body of the right atrium/right atrial
appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color
Doppler. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. Regional left ventricular
wall motion is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%). [Intrinsic left
ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the
severity of valvular regurgitation.] The right ventricle
displays normal free wall contractility. There are simple
atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are moderately thickened. The mitral valve leaflets are
myxomatous. There is partial mitral leaflet flail involving the
P2 scallop. An eccentric, anteriorly directed jet of severe (4+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. Moderate [2+] tricuspid
regurgitation is seen. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 914**] was notified in person of the
results in the operating room at the time of the study.

POST BYPASS The patient is being AV paced. There is normal right
ventricular systolic function. The left ventricle displays mild
to moderate global hypokinesis with an EF in the 40 to 45%
range. There is a mitral annular ring in situ. It appears well
seated. The mitral valve is s/p repair. There is mild, valvular
mitral regurgitation. There is no mitral stenosis. There is
trace to mild tricuspid regurgitation. The thoracic aorta is
intact after decannulation.
  I certify that I was present for this procedure in compliance
with HCFA regulations.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 87978**] was presented to an outside hospital emergency
department with chest pain and fever.  An echo cardiogram
revealed a torn mitral valve chord and severe mitral
regurgitation.  She underwent a cardiac catheterization which
revealed clean coronaries and a balloon pump was placed
secondary to poor right heart function.  She was then
transferred for surgical evaluation.  Infectious disease was
consulted on arrival given her fever history and she was placed
on antibiotics until her valve tissue cultures returned
negative.  On [**2193-1-16**] she underwent a mitral valve repair and
corematrix closure of pericardium.  Please see the operative
note for details.  She tolerated this procedure well and was
transferred in critical but stable condition to the surgical
intensive care unit.  She was extubated and her balloon pump
removed.   She was seen by the renal service for elevated
creatinine, which resolved below baseline at discharge.  She had
atrial fibrillation and responded with bradycardia to amiodarone
on conversion to sinus rhythm.  She was seen by
electrophysiology for evaluation of electrical cardioversion or
pacemaker. Her chest tubes were removed and she was transferred
to the surigal step down unit.  By post op
