History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **]F h/o HTN, PVD, spinal stenosis, who was transferred from
[**Hospital1 **] after presenting with calf pain and numbness x 1
day. Pt reports having left leg pain "off and on" for months.
Was diagnosed with bursitis and has been receiving steroid
injections. Yesterday pt reports pain was so severe that she
fell to the ground. EMS was called, and pt was taken to OSH
where O2sat was 82% on RA/100%on NRB. Pt denied SOB, cough, CP.
Also denied N/V/D/F/C/dysuria, or abdominal pain
W/U at OSH notable for EKG changes without ishemic changes, CXR
showing honeycombing insterstitial patterns. CTA was negative
for PE but showed patchy ground glass opacities, bibasilar
fibrosis, peripheral bullous disease and increased interstitial
markings.
Pt started on empiric CTX and zithro, given supp O2, and
transferred to the [**Hospital1 **] per pt's request.

Past Medical History:
HTN, PVD, Hypercholesterolemia, spinal stenosis, h/o pleural
empyema as child s/p surgery, bilateral cataracts, fibrocystic
breast disease; echo [**2114**]: EF 65% with mild pulmonary HTN


Social History:
Lives alone in [**Hospital3 **].  Quit tobacco 30 years ago,
40-50 pack year history prior.  EtOH: 2 glasses of wine a day.
Former real estate [**Doctor Last Name 360**].

Family History:
Non contributory

Physical Exam:
At the time of death:
Pulseless, apneic
No response to sternal rub, corneal reflex, or nailbed pressure.
No heart sounds or lung sounds.

UNILAT LOWER EXT VEINS LEFT PORT  [**2115-12-31**] 9:17 AM
Left common femoral, superficial femoral, and popliteal veins
demonstrate normal compressibility, color flow, Doppler
waveforms, and response to augmentation. No intraluminal
thrombus is identified.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2115-12-30**] 9:20 PM
A mild degree of bilateral pulmonary vascular congestion and
cardiomegaly.

ECHO Study Date of [**2116-1-2**]
The left atrium is normal in size. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF 60-70%). No masses or thrombi  are seen in the left
ventricle. There is no ventricular septal defect. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
ascending aorta is moderately dilated. There are three aortic
valve leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately
thickened. There is moderate aortic valve stenosis. Mild to
moderate ([**11-24**]+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Mild to moderate ([**11-24**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate [2+]
tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial
effusion.

CT Chest - Findings consistent with possible nonspecific
interstitial pneumonitis.


Brief Hospital Course:
Upon admission to [**Hospital1 18**] MICU, patient was placed on NRB w/ nasal
cannula for additional oxygen delivery, and it was noted that
patient would desaturate with any attempt to remove mask.  CT
suggested a diffuse process w/ ground-glass opacities and
differential diagnoses included LIP,IPF/UIP,AIP/ARDS,BOOP,PAP.
Nonetheless, patient appeared subjectively without distress.
However, on subsequent days, despite empiric antibiotic
treatment and diuresis for presumptive pneumonia and pulmonary
edema, patient's hypoxia continued to progress and patient
ultimately became subjectively dyspneic.  In addition, patient
was also treated empirically for Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia
w/ high dose sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim.  Echocardiogram
revealed no significant only 2+TR, normal LV function, and no
findings that would explain patient's persistent progressive
hypoxia.  Lower extremity doppler ultrasound revealed no
evidence of deep venous thromboses.

Hypoxia was considered to be less likely due to infectious
and/or cardiogenic causes and thought more to be secondary to a
primary pulmonary process.  Radiological consultants suggested
that CT findings were consistent with nonspecific interstitial
pneumonitis.  Therefore, in addition to empiric antibiotics,
patient was given high dose steroids in an attempt to reverse
any acute changes - as it was felt that patient's hypoxia was
most likely an acute exacerbation of chronic pulmonary process.
On hospital day six, given patient's continued progressive
symptomatic hypoxia (found confused whenever patient had
accidentally removed NRB mask), patient was electively intubated
by anesthesia.

At that point, open lung biopsy was considered to determine
cause of patient's pulmonary disease, however, in discussion
with family and thoracic surgery consultants, it was felt that
patient would not have been interested in such an invasive
procedure, and that yield in terms of diagnosis of a reversible
cause would be extremely low.

As patient continued to exhibit no improvedment over the next
five days, a decision was made by the patient's family and
healthcare proxy to withdraw care and extubate patient.  Patient
was given comfort measures only and expired at 2:30 PM [**2116-1-10**].
