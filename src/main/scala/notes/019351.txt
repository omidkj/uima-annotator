Service:  [**Location (un) **]

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Fever.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 68-year-old woman with
a past medical history of stage IV gastric cancer complicated
by superior vena cava syndrome and small-bowel obstruction
requiring colostomy as well as right internal jugular vein
deep venous thrombosis, bilateral malignant pleural
effusions, and hydronephrosis requiring bilateral stent
placement who presented to [**Hospital3 1196**] with a
chief complaint of fever.

The patient had been recently admitted to [**Hospital3 20445**] from [**1-13**] to [**1-23**] for superior vena
cava syndrome, pleural effusions, and extrinsic ureteral
compression, status post bilateral stent placement.  At that
time, she received thrombolysis and had a superior vena cava
stent placed.  During that hospitalization she had bilateral
thoracenteses which revealed metastatic adenocarcinoma.  She
had bilateral renal stents placed as well for the extrinsic
compression.

Since that discharge she had been doing well without pain at
home or any specific complaints.  She did note some bleeding
from her ostomy bag being changed several days ago, but
otherwise denies any complaints.  No chest pain, abdominal
pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, dysuria, etcetera.  She
also denies headache, neck stiffness, sinus tenderness, sore
throat, rashes, cough, or change in her ostomy output, or
melena.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Stage IV gastric cancer diagnosed in [**2118**] with metastases
to her para-aortic and retroperitoneal lymph nodes.
2.  Superior vena cava syndrome in [**2121-1-11**].
3.  Small-bowel obstruction requiring colostomy.
4.  Hydronephrosis in [**2120-12-12**] requiring bilateral
stent placement.
5.  Right internal jugular vein deep venous thrombosis,
status post chemotherapy with Xeloda and Taxotere; stopped
secondary to adverse effects; changed to naboline.
6.  Status post total abdominal hysterectomy/bilateral
salpingo-oophorectomy.
7.  Status post appendectomy.
8.  Bilateral malignant pleural effusions.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Ativan, Compazine, Fentanyl at
50 mcg, MS Contin 10 mg p.o. b.i.d., Ditropan, oxycodone,
Coumadin 2 mg p.o. q.h.s., and Lasix.

ALLERGIES:  Allergy to SULFA and INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Positive 40-pack-year tobacco history; quit
in [**2110**].  No alcohol.  Lives with her husband and four
children who are very involved in her care.  Daughter is her
health care proxy.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Father died of lung cancer.  Mother and
sister died of ovarian cancer, and mother also had gastric
cancer.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:   Physical examination
on admission revealed a temperature of 102.4, heart rate
of 112, respiratory rate of 27, blood pressure of 73/34, 88%
on 4 liters nasal cannula.  In general, this was an awake and
alert female in mild distress.  Pupils were equal, round, and
reactive to light.  The oropharynx was clear.  Dentures were
in place.  Dry mucous membranes.  Sclerae were anicteric.
Pale conjunctivae.  Normocephalic and atraumatic.  Neck was
supple.  Neck veins were intact and flat.  Chest was clear to
auscultation bilaterally, except dullness at the right vase.
Cardiovascular examination was regular, tachycardic.  First
heart sound and second heart sound.  Abdomen was soft,
nontender, and nondistended, positive bowel sounds.
Colostomy in place with brown stool.  Extremities were warm,
2+ distal pulses, right greater than left edema.
Neurologically, cranial nerves II through XII were grossly
intact except for decreased hearing.  Moved all extremities
well.  Skin revealed no lesions or rashes.

PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:  Notable
laboratories on admission from the outside hospital on
[**1-25**] revealed a white blood cell count of 0.5,
hematocrit of 32.2, and platelets of 186.  Laboratories upon
admission to [**Hospital1 69**] revealed a
white blood cell count of 2.9, hematocrit of 27.6, platelets
of 149.  Sodium of 137, potassium of 2.9, chloride of 104,
bicarbonate of 22, blood urea nitrogen of 18, creatinine
of 1.1, and blood sugar of 99.  Alkaline phosphatase of 160,
ALT of 11, AST of 29, total bilirubin of 1.1, albumin of 2.4,
calcium of 10.4, phosphate of 1.8, magnesium of 1.3, uric
acid of 4.2.

HOSPITAL COURSE:   The patient was admitted to the Medical
Intensive Care Unit for septic shock of unclear source.

1.  INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  The patient with febrile
neutropenia.  The patient was started on vancomycin,
gentamicin, Flagyl, and piperacillin. Required Levophed for
pressure support.  Urinalysis as well as blood cultures at
[**Hospital3 1196**] were reportedly positive for
gram-negative rods.  Renal stents last replaced on [**1-17**].  Genitourinary was consulted regarding whether or not to
change the stents but did not feel that this was necessary
given her subsequent negative urinalyses and her good
response to antibiotics.  Sensitivities returned for the
gram-negative rods at the outside hospital, and the patient
was found to have pan-sensitive Escherichia coli.  The
patient was switched to p.o. levofloxacin,  and vancomycin,
gentamicin, piperacillin, and Flagyl were all discontinued.
The patient continued to have good urine output, afebrile,
and stable blood pressure over the course of the next week.

2.  HEMATOLOGY:  INR found to be elevated upon admission
to 3.5.  Coumadin was held.  DIC panel was negative for DIC
cause of elevated INR.  Vitamin K was administered, and INR
normalized or decreased to 2.6.  PTT normalized at 31.6.
Coumadin was restarted later on in the course of the
patient's hospitalization for management of her superior vena
cava syndrome.

3.  CARDIOVASCULAR:  The patient initially with hypotension,
on Levophed and vasopressin.  As urosepsis was treated with
antibiotics, and the patient stabilized, these medications
were discontinued.  Further blood cultures were all negative.

(b)  Pump:  The patient was given 10 liters of intravenous
fluids in the Intensive Care Unit causing some fluid overload
which was diuresed with Lasix over the course of the next
week on the floor.

4.  PULMONARY:  The [**Hospital 228**] hospital course was exacerbated
by possible chronic obstructive pulmonary disease flare given
her significant wheezing.  Other possibilities included
cardiac secondary to congestive heart failure.  However,
prednisone taper and nebulizers were begun, and the patient
had a good response and maintained good oxygen saturations.

5.  FLUIDS/ELECTROLYTES/NUTRITION:  The patient with
hypokalemia during hospitalization and repleted daily with
potassium supplements as well as being discharged home on
potassium supplementation.

6.  GASTROINTESTINAL:  The patient with good colostomy output
during this hospitalization.  No issues.

DISCHARGE FOLLOWUP:   The patient was to follow up with her
primary care physician/oncologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 174**], at the end of
the week.

DISCHARGE STATUS/DISPOSITION:  To home with [**Hospital6 1587**] for frequent INR checks until the patient has
followup; also with a prednisone taper for a chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease flare.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
 1.  Prednisone 40 mg p.o. q.d., to be tapered over the
course of the next week.
 2.  Coumadin 2 mg p.o. q.d., to be further adjusted by
primary care physician.
 3.  Potassium chloride 40 mEq p.o. q.d.
 4.  OxyContin 10 mg p.o. b.i.d.
 5.  Lasix 20 mg p.o. q.d.
 6.  Ativan 2 mg p.o. q.h.s.
 7.  Iron sulfate 325 mg p.o. t.i.d.
 8.  Epogen 20,000 units subcutaneous every week.
 9.  Albuterol nebulizers q.4h. p.r.n.
10.  Protonix 40 mg p.o. q.d.
11.  Levaquin 500 mg p.o. q.d. (for a total 14-day course).
12.  Duragesic patch 75 mcg.
13.  Lorazepam 3 mg p.o. q.h.s.
14.  Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d.
