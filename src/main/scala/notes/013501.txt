HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient was a 66 year old
gentleman with a history significant for multiple sclerosis,
hypertension, coronary artery disease, multiple right lower
extremity deep venous thromboses, and chronic GI bleeds, who
was admitted on [**2105-12-26**] with fever, nausea and vomiting.
and tachycardic.  He had two recent admissions, one between
[**12-8**] and [**12-12**], for a non-Q wave myocardial infarction
status post catheterization and stents times two complicated by
ventricular fibrillation arrest and aortic dissection and his
second admission between [**12-15**] and [**12-16**], for chest
pain and neck pain, ruling out for myocardial infarction.

precordial T wave inversions.  He was started on
Nitroglycerin drip, morphine, given aspirin and because of
his hypotension was transferred from the floor to the
Intensive Care Unit.  He was started on Dopamine infusion for
his blood pressure, given Solu-Medrol times one.  He had also
been started on Neo-Synephrine and the following day this was
able to be weaned down.  Meanwhile, blood cultures from the
outlying hospital came back growing four out of four bottles
of Pseudomonas aeruginosa.  The patient was also noted to
have increased liver function tests and acute renal failure.

GI, Renal, Infectious Disease consultations were obtained.  A
right upper quadrant ultrasound showed normal common bile
duct, fatty infiltration of his liver and his increased liver
function tests were thought to be secondary to cholestasis
secondary to sepsis/hypotension.  Hepatitis serologies were
negative.  His acute renal failure was thought to be
secondary to ATN from his hypotension.  The patient was on
Ceftaz and Levaquin and sensitivities for Pseudomonas
returned positive for Amikacin, Ceftaz, Ciprofloxacin,
Gentamicin, Imipenem, and Zosyn.  The patient had had an
indwelling left Perma-Cath for his ATCH infusions that he
received every few months for his multiple sclerosis and this
was removed thinking that it may be the source of his
infection, especially as he had reported that it had been red
and tender prior to admission.

His antibiotics coverage was then changed to Ciprofloxacin
and Zosyn.  Chest x-rays at this time started to show
bilateral diffuse patchy opacities.  Chest CT scan showed
ground glass opacities with air bronchograms peripherally.
Septic emboli were entertained as a possible
etiology.  The patient had been on heparin infusion during
the prior month for his myocardial infarction and at this
time his platelets were decreasing significantly.  TTP was
ruled out.  Hemolysis labs were negative.  There was only a
mild to moderate DIC picture due to the infection.  Finally,
a positive HIT test returned and his aspirin was discontinued
secondary to his thrombocytopenia.  All heparin products were
discontinued.  Neurology was consulted for a change in mental
status, but because of his low platelets, a lumbar puncture
was deferred and eventually thought not to be necessary as
his mental status improved.

MRI/MRA/MRV of his head were consistent with multiple
sclerosis but no other acute pathologic changes.  A TTE
showed no vegetations.  TE was delayed until he was more
stable.  Meanwhile, the patient developed a right upper
extremity swelling and was found to have a superficial
femoral vein thrombosis as well as a deep venous thrombosis
of the inferior portion of the jugular vein and right
subclavian vein.  A Hematology consultation was initiated and
they recommended starting a Lepirudin infusion with a goal
PTT of 60.

On the [**12-4**], the patient was stable enough to be
transferred to the Floor.  His respiratory status continued
to improve.  He was coughing up dark reddish brown sputum
which he had been for past week or two.  He continued to be
afebrile.  A transesophageal echocardiogram was obtained and
no vegetations were seen.  A repeat CT scan showed lung
abscesses and an increased and loculated right pleural effusion.
Sputum cultures grew moderate to heavy growth of Pseudomonas. His
Lepirudin was continued, however, at midnight between
[**1-11**] and 12, his Lepirudin was stopped in preparation
for a diagnostic of his right loculated pleural effusion to
rule out empyema.

The thoracentesis occurred at approximately 1 p.m. on
[**1-12**], and the procedure was without incident.  However,
when he returned to his room, he became hypotensive with a
systolic blood pressure drop into the 60s without responding
to fluids.  The patient looked pale and was complaining of
abdominal discomfort, no chest pain, and initially was able
to converse.  He then had one tablespoon of frank hemoptysis.
His lung sounds were rhonchorous and he became diaphoretic.
EKG showed no significant change.

Eventually, the patient became unresponsive and a Code was
called.  Dopamine drip was started.  The patient was in PEA
and Atropine and epinephrine were given per protocol.  CPR
was initiated and continued for 40 minutes.  Bilateral chest
tubes were done with minimal flow of fluid, and a bedside
echocardiogram showed minimal heart activity without
pericardial effusion.  Chest x-ray showed increased right
pleural effusion but no tension pneumothorax.

After 40 minutes of CPR, the patient was pronounced dead at
04:04 p.m.

CAUSE OF DEATH:
1.  Hypotension secondary to pneumonia.

The attending was notified and she notified the family.  A
postmortem was declined.
