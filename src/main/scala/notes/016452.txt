Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2279**]
Chief Complaint:
Unresponsive at hemodialysis.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Hemodialysis
ICU care


History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 104435**] is a 60 y.o. F with type 1 DM, ESRD on HD, breast
cancer, and pulmonary sarcoidosis who was at scheduled
hemodialysis session when she was noted to become unresponsive
for 8 minutes with normal vital signs and was bag-mask
ventilated.  Per her daughter, the patient is usually on NC
while getting HD, but when she saw her, the NC was off.
Daughter stated that she tried to put it on her nose and that it
looked like she was "gagging."  Her head then rolled backward
and her eyes looked to the ceiling.  No history of sz disorder
per daughter.  Unsure if pt became incontinent, but daughter
states that this unresponsiveness has happened in past with
incontinence.

In the ED, the patient followed simple commands and moving all
extremities, but reportedly with diffusely tender abdominal
exam.  Of note, she has a long history of non-responsive
episodes that occur at HD sessions, most recently noted on
[**5-8**] hospitalization where she became transiently
hypotensive to 70s on [**2109-5-11**].  She did not have any more
episodes of non-responsiveness during that hospitalization and
remained normotensive on the medical floor.
.
In the ED, VS: 98.9  91/53  HR 96  RR 20  96% on NRB.
FAST reported negative.  CXR with cardiomegaly and mild
pulmonary edema.  EKG unchanged compared to prior.  Given
clindamycin x 1 and zosyn x 1.  1 L IVFs given.  CT head
negative.  CT torso could not be completed as pt without any PIV
and cannot run contrast through any central access or PICC.  EJ
placed.  Per [**Name (NI) **], pt with "labile" blood pressures.
.
On admission to the ICU, the patient was only slightly
responsive to yelling with moaning and groaning.

Past Medical History:
1. End stage renal disease on HD T,Th,Sat
2. Diabeted mellitus, Type 1
3. Hypertension
4. Coronary artery disease
5. Gout
6. Asthma
7. Atrial fibrillation
8. Sarcoidosis
9. Pulmonary HTN
10. Obstructive sleep apnea
11. Ventral hernia
12. HIT positive (per pt, but not seen in [**Hospital1 18**] records)
13. Breast CA
[**14**]. Multiple fistula revisions
15. s/p unilateral oophorectomy
16. Septic arthritis (left knee)
17. Hypothyroidism

Social History:
She was previously living with her daughter, however after a
recent hospital stay for septic arthritis was undergoing
rehabilitation at a specialty hospital.  She quit smoking 30
years ago after a 20-pack-year history.  She denies alcohol
consumption.

Family History:
Brother: sarcoidosis. Mother/father with heart disease, MIs.

Pertinent Results:
CXR's:
[**2109-8-19**]: In comparison with the study of [**8-13**], the opacifications
consistent with pulmonary edema have worsened. Again, the
possibility of supervening pneumonia cannot be excluded. Given
that the patient is in hemodialysis, a post-procedure study
should demonstrate some clearing of this process.  Repeat CXR on
[**2109-8-20**] In comparison with study of [**8-19**], the degree of vascular
congestion is decreased. Opacification persists at the left and
possibly right base with obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm.
This is consistent with pleural fluid and atelectasis, though
supervening pneumonia can certainly not be excluded, especially
in view of the clinical history.
.
[**2109-8-13**]: In comparison with the study of [**8-12**], there is again
diffuse pulmonary opacifications consistent with pulmonary
edema, though supervening pneumonia cannot be excluded. Little
change from the previous study.
.
Echo [**2109-8-13**]:  Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of
[**2107-5-4**], probable vegetation (vs. torn chordae) is now seen on
the tricuspid valve and the severity of tricuspid regurgitation
has markedly increased. In addition, the right ventricle is now
more dilated (was dilated on review of the prior study) with
free wall hypyokinesis and the interatrial septum is now
deviated towards the left atrium. The mitral leaflets and
supporting structures are also more fibrotic.
.
EEG  [**2109-8-13**]: This is an abnormal portable routine EEG due to the
slow
background. These findings suggest widespread moderate
encephalopathy. Medications, metabolic disturbances, and
infections are among the most common causes. Of note is the
multiple APCs. No lateralizing or seizure activity was seen.
.
Abd US:
[**2109-8-10**]: 1. Cholelithiasis with mild thickening of the
gallbladder wall, without evidence for pericholecystic fluid or
biliary ductal dilatation. Findings could reflect sequela of
chronic liver disease or third spacing from CHF or low albumin.
2. Limited evaluation of the pancreas due to overlying bowel
gas.
.
Repeat on [**2109-8-16**]: 1. Unchanged nonmobile gallstones in the
gallbladder neck, without gallbladder distention or
pericholecystic fluid. Mild thickening of gallbladder wall is
also unchanged. 2. No intra- or extra-hepatic biliary ductal
dilatation. 3. No ascites.
.
CT torso [**2109-8-9**]:
1. No etiology for patient's altered mental status identified.
2. Interval development of small bilateral pleural effusions and
extensive worsening of diffuse anasarca.
3. Extensive bilateral nodular opacities predominantly within
the upper lobes may be sequela of the patient's known
sarcoidosis or represent an acute infectious process. Scattered
ground-glass opacities, resulting in mosaic attenuation in the
lung is likely related to underlying airtrapping or mild
alveolar edema. Would consider repeat chest CT when patient is
stable to better stage sarcoid if alteration in management will
occur.
4. Unchanged large ventral hernia without CT findings to suggest

incarceration/strangulation although this is a clinical
diagnosis.
5. Cholelithiasis.
.
CT Head:
[**2109-8-9**] There is no hemorrhage, edema, mass effect, or
shift of normally midline structures. There is mild diffuse
atrophy which is most pronounced in the cerebellum. There are
also calcifications of the basal ganglia bilaterally and
calcification of the cavernous carotid arteries bilaterally.
These findings are not changed since the prior study. There is
partial opacification of the left mastoid air cells. The
visualized paranasal sinuses are otherwise unremarkable, and the
soft tissues are unremarkable.
.
[**2109-8-19**]: There is no evidence for hemorrhage, edema or mass. The
ventricles and sulci are of normal size and configuration. The
calvarium and soft tissues are unremarkable. The visualized
ethmoid air cells and paranasal sinuses are normal. Again noted
is partial opacification of the mastoid air cells, not
significantly changed from prior studies when accounting for
differences in technique. Incidentally noted are calcifications
in the carotid arteries bilaterally, stable from prior studies.
IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial process.
.
UE US [**2109-8-15**]: Patent upper extremity surgical AV fistula, no
thrombus or fluid collection is seen, greater than 50% stenosis
at the level of the venous anastomosis.
