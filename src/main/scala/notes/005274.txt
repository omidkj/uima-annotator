Azithromycin / Penicillins

Attending:[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 812**]
Chief Complaint:
hypothermia, lethargy

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None.


History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 71 yo man with h/o cognitive delay, IDDM, and
seizure disorder, non-verbal at baseline, who presented from his
nursing home with altered mental status. Per report, the patient
was in his normal state of health until yesterday, when he was
reported to be "under the weather." This afternoon, he became
lethargic and did not open his eyes when spoken to. His nurse
took his vital signs, and his rectal temperature was found to be
92. He was thus brought to the ED for further evaluation.
.
In the ED, his initial VS were T 86.2 (92 rectally), P 53, BP
122/96, R 24, O2:100% sat. On transfer from the stretcher to the
bed, he had a very wet cough. His FSBG was 54, so he was given
an amp of D50. He was found to be hyperkalemic, so he was given
Albuterol, Insulin 10 U, and glucose, and his repeat glucose was
18. He was thus started on a D50 gtt. His CXR showed patchy
infiltrates bilaterally, so he was given CTX/Vanc/Levaquin for
presumed HAP. He was placed in a bear hugger and he was given
warm fluids, and his repeat temperature was 35.3 and his pulse
increased to 70. His VS at the time of transfer were BP 109/37,
P 75, O2 99% on 3L NC.
.
On the floor, the patient is lethargic but opens his eyes on
command. He was unable to express any acute concerns.

disorder, dementia, osteoporosis, dysphagia, aspirations,
psychosis.

IMAGING
[**2-14**] CT ABD/PELVIS W/O CONT
IMPRESSION: 1. Severe bilateral hydroureteronephrosis, left
worse than right, without definite evidence of mass or
obstructing stones. Distal obstruction at the level of the
bladder (from an infiltrative neoplasm), prostate gland, or
urethra are most likely. There is suggestion of bladder wall
thickening on this exam, though evaluation is very limited due
to lack of bladder distention and contrast -- further evaluation
with cystoscopy could be considered. 2. Extensive sigmoid
diverticulosis with surrounding stranding suggestive of
diverticulitis.

3. Trace bilateral pleural effusions and bibasilar ground-glass
opacities,
which likely represents atelectasis, though infection is not
excluded.

Brief Hospital Course:
#. Hypothermia: The patient was found to be hypothermic in the
ED to 86, and his temperature increased to 97 with a bear hugger
and warm fluids. It is uncertain how long the patient had been
hypothermic prior to presentation. His mental status improved
with re-warming.
.
#. Hyperkalemia: Potassium on arrival in the ED was elevated at
5.9. He was given insulin, albuterol, and one amp of D50, and
his EKG at the time did not show any evidence of peaked T waves.
He was likely hyperkalemic secondary to acute renal failure;
this resolved completely as kidney function returned to
baseline. K 4.2 on discharge.
.
#. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelets were 92 at
presentation (from his baseline of 250).  DIC labs were
unremarkable and peripheral smear did not show schistocytes.
Platelet count started to improve on transfer to the floor and
was back to baseline at the time of discharge.
.
#. Acute on chronic renal failure: Mr. [**Known lastname 104901**] creatinine on
admission was 2.5 (elevated from his baseline of 1.7). Likely
secondary to obstructive nephropathy given finding of severe
bilateral hydronephrosis on renal ultrasound. Source of
obstruction is unclear. Urology recommends foley catheter x 2
weeks. Cystogram did not show any evidence of vesicoureteral
reflux.
.
#. Melena: Patient noted to have melenic stool, guaiac positive
on the morning of [**2113-2-13**] with a hematocrit drop.  One unit pRBCs
transfused. NG lavage showed pink blood which cleared after 250
cc.  GI consult recommended an outpatient colonoscopy if the
patient has not had one recently and it is line with his goals
of care.  After this melenic stool, patient's stools remained
greenish brown and guaiac negative. Hematocrit remained stable.
.
#. Hypoglycemia: The patient has a history of IDDM, for which he
takes Novolin 15 U daily. His FSBG on presentation to the ED was
54, and this decreased to 18 after receiving 10 U of regular
insulin for hyperkalemia. He was placed on a D50 gtt. On the
floor, he received another 10 U of regular insulin for
hyperkalemia, and his repeat FSBG was again decreased at 34.
Patient was initially on D50 gtt and home dose of novolin
insulin was held.  Once started on tube feeds on evening of
[**2113-2-14**], glucose drip was discontinued and sugars remained stable
in the 100-130s.
.
#. Right upper extremity DVT: On transfer, patient's right hand
was noted to be swollen. A right upper extremity ultrasound
showed a DVT of one of the right brachial veins. The patient was
started on a hep
