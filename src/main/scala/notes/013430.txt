History of Present Illness:
This is an 80 year-old female with a past medical history of
hypertension, type II DM and anemia who presents with increased
finger sticks for the last 24 hours and is admitted to the ICU
on an insulin gtt.

Per report, the patient presented to her PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**1-24**] with
complaints of cough, increased phelgm, wheezing, chest tightness
and difficulty sleeping for the last few days.  She had been
started on azithromycin, flovent and proair the day prior for
her symptoms.  She was diagnosed with bronchitis/asthma
exacerbation and additionally started on 60 mg prednisone with a
taper over the next 12 days. The patient reports she took 60 mg
on the first day and 50 the next.

Since that time, the patient reports she has been feeling
improved, but still with persistent cough and phlegm.  Denies
fevers.  She presented to the ED yesterday, however, as her FSBG
had been [**Location (un) 1131**] high (>500) on her home glucometer.  She notes
that she had been told to monitor her blood sugars more
carefully while on prednisone.

She denies polydipsia, polyuria, vision changes, headache,
abdominal symptoms, chest pain, weakness or other symptoms.
Pertinent positives as above.

In the ED, initial VS were 96.7 148/66 76 24 97% on RA.  She was
first given 10 units of Regular insulin SQ without effect. The
patient was started on an insulin gtt at 7 units/hr around 4:45
on the morning of admission, first recheck of FS still elevated
over 500.  She received a total of 1.5L of normal saline over
her first 8 hours in the ED; this was subsequently increased
after her creatinine increased over several hours.  She also
received combivent x4,

Brief Hospital Course:
80 year-old female with a history of type II DM who presents
with hyperglycemia.

# Hyperglycemia: The patient presented with a hyperosmolar
hyperglycemic state given that she had no ketones in her urine
and history of type II DM, pH >7.30, bicarb >15 though patient
has had no neurologic abnormalities.  Also had a mild AG
acidosis on admission which closed as her sugars were brought
down.  She has had relatively well-controlled DM for many years,
on oral agents including glipizide and actos.  Her last A1C was
6.6 in [**Month (only) 359**] of this year.  Her hyperglycemia was likely the
result of high doses of prednisone for her asthma exacerbation
in addition to possible missed doses of her medications.  She
was placed on an insulin gtt and quickly weaned off it as her
BSs dropped.  She was given NS at 200 cc/h until her sugars fell
below 300 and then given D5 1/2NS until she was off the insulin
gtt and eating normally.  BCx and flu test negative. UCx
eventually grew out E. coli so she was started on a 7-day course
of Cipro. CE were checked and her CK was mildly elevated at 216
and trended down, trops were negative.  [**Last Name (un) **] was consulted and
recommended that she stay on insulin rather than oral
hypoglycemics.  She was transitioned to lantus and sliding scale
insulin and will follow up with [**Last Name (un) **] as an outpatient.

# Acute on chronic renal insufficiency: Her baseline creatinine
appears to be around 1.5, and on admission it was elevated to
2.1.  Her ARF was likely secondary to prerenal/volume
contraction from HHS. She had received 1.5L of fluid total over
8 hours in the ED.  She was given NS at 200 cc/h until her
sugars fell below 300 and then given D5 1/2NS until she was off
the insulin gtt and eating normally.  Her enalapril, Diovan, and
Lasix were held. On discharge her creatinine was 1.7 and she was
advised to follow up with her PCP as an outpatient for renal
function monitoring and consideration of resuming these
medications.

# Hyponatremia: The patient's inital serum Na was 132, however
the corrected serum Na is approximately 139 when accounting for
hyperglycemia.  Her hyperglycemia was treated and given was
given IVF and her Na corrected.

# Bronchitis: The patient was short of breath for the last
several days, on azithro and prednisone with some improvement in
her symptoms.  She was treated with high dose fluticasone,
salmeterol, standing atrovent, and albuterol prn.  She was also
given 10 mg of prednisone for a 5-day course and continued for
another 3 days on azithromycin for anti-inflammatory effect.
She was put a PPI for prophylaxis while she was being treated
with prednisone. Her symptoms improved dramatically on this
regimen, and she was advised to take Advair daily to help keep
her asthma under control.

# Anemia: The patient has a chronic anemia and her last iron
studies were checked in [**2186-12-9**].  She appeared to be at
baseline of around 24-26.  She had no clinical evidence of
bleeding.

# Hypertension: Her lasix, enalapril, and diovan were held
initally given her hypovolemic state.  She was continued on
diltiazem. As her BP was under control on discharge off of the
above medications, she was advised to follow up with her PCP for
consideration of resuming these as an outpatient.
