Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2297**]
Chief Complaint:
Melena

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **] F c hx chronic back/hip/leg pain, HTN, multi-infarct related
dementia, who presents with melena from nursing home. Pt. had
episode of 200 cc of melena this afternoon. By report, no chest
pain, dizziness, light headedness, abdominal pain at the time.
No prior history of GIB. On ASA, Plavix for hx of CVA. Has been
taking NSAIDS for chronic pain.
.
In the ED, hemodynamically stable with HCT 28 (last 31 [**6-29**]).
Family had decided to pursue upper endoscopy at this time as per
report. Admitted for further monitoring.
.
While on the floor, patient had coffee ground emesis and melena.
Underwent NG lavage with return of "coffee grounds" and bilious
fluid, which did not clear after 250 cc lavage. Patient noted to
be increasing tachycardic with HR to 130s. BP 107/80 at time of
transfer to MICU. Patient's family was present and consented to
blood transfusions and EGD.
.
On arrival to the MICU, patient noted to have ST seg depressions
on tele. EKG with new 3-[**Street Address(2) 5366**] seg depressions in V2-V6
concerning for acute MI. Cardiology was consulted via phone and
agreed that the ST seg changes were probably [**2-24**] to demand in
setting of dropping HCT and that she would not be a candidate
for anti-coagulation in the setting of a significant GI bleed.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)

Reason: ? change

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
[**Age over 90 **] year old woman with CAD now with UGIB and wheezing/SOB s/p
blood products with slightly lessening O2 requirement
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
? change
AP CHEST, 3:07 A.M., [**10-31**]:

HISTORY: Coronary artery disease, upper GI bleed, wheezing and
shortness of breath after blood product administration. Coronary
artery disease.

IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**2157-1-12**] through
[**2158-10-30**].

What looked more like mild pulmonary edema and small bilateral
pleural effusions on [**10-28**] has improved in the left lung
leaving areas of dense consolidation at the lung bases and more
discrete mass-like lesions in the right upper lobe. Overall, the
findings suggest widespread infection even infarction. Small
bilateral pleural effusions remain. Heart size is normal.
Thoracic aorta is generally large and tortuous. No pneumothorax.
A severe thoracolumbar scoliosis is noted.

Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1887**] was paged to report these findings at the time
of dictation.

Approved: TUE [**2158-10-31**] 2:42 PM


Brief Hospital Course:
# GIB - Suspect upper source given coffee ground emesis and
melena. Now with dropping HCT and increased heart rate
suggestive of hemodynamic instability. GI came to bedside and
attempted EGD, however, patient desatted x 2 when they tried to
pass the endoscope. Procedure was aborted and family meeting was
held. Patient did not wish to be intubated for any reason, so
the family decided not to intubate for an EGD and instead to
manage her GI bleed in a non-invasive manner.  A pantoprazole
drip was begun and the patient received a total a 5 units of
PRBCs. After transfusion, her HCT stabilized and she showed no
further signs of bleeding/melena. Her pantoprazole was
eventually changed to a PO formulation and she was advanced to
purree diet with nectar thick liquids with no complications.

# Myocardial ischemia - The patient presented with significant
ST depressions in V2-V6 during her acute bleed which resolved
after fluid and blood administration. Her cardiac enzymes did
increase to a peak troponin of >0.5, likely demand ischemia.
Cardiology felt she was not a candidate for anticoagulation in
the setting of the acute bleed. She was tachycardic and
hypertensive after blood administration which was initially
controlled with an esmolol drip but was eventually transitioned
to PO lopressor.

# HTN - Transitioned to lopressor PO TID
.
.
# Psych/depression- She was continued on her home seroquel,
trazadone, and lexapro when she began taking POs. She was
occasionally more delirious with some periods of mild aggitation
for which she received Zydis 5mg.
.
# Hypothyroidism - Restarted on home dose of synthroid
.
# FEN - dysphagia purree with nectar thick liquids
.
#Dispo- In discussion with the patients family, a palliative
care consult and the medical team, it was decided that there
would be no further escalation in the care of Ms. [**Known lastname 63749**].
She would continue on her current PO meds, taking them as she
could, as well as her current diet but that no further
interventions including NG tubes, IV drugs, or other invasive
procedures. She should not be hospitalized again. She will
return home to [**Hospital3 537**] on essentially hospice.
