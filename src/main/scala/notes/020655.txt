Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 358**]
Chief Complaint:
R Lower extremity DVT, Pulmonary embolism.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
Mr [**Known lastname **] is a previously healthy 21 yo gentleman with no
significant past medical history who presented to [**Hospital 4683**] hospital with a three week history of SOB, cough,
intermittent chest pain and a three day history of right leg
pain.  He initially attributed these sxs to URI because his SOB
started with cough and fever therefore he treated with aleve and
mucinex.  He finally went to the hospital when his SOB did not
improve and he started experiencing leg pain.  He has no history
of recent trauma or prolongued periods of inactivity.

On presentation to [**Hospital3 10310**] Hospital on [**12-29**] his D dimer
was elevated at 7,959. He was given lovenox and sent for CT
chest. ECG at that time showed new right bundle branch block
compared to prior. CT showed massive bilateral pulmonary
embolism involving both arteries. He was then started on heparin
and was noted to be subtheraputic prior to episode of pleuritic
chest pain [**12-30**] in right lower back radiating to the shoulder.
At that time patient was noted to have HR 11, but stable BP and
O2 sat 93-96% 2LNC. Heparin was increased from 1100 to 1200
units, and a 5,000 unit bolus was given. Patient's pain was
treated with 6mg morphine iv and the patient was transferred to
[**Hospital1 **] ICU for [**Hospital 35455**] medical care.

Past Medical History:
ADD
Suicide Attempt for which he was hospitalized at BayRidge
Finger Fracture


Social History:
Pt lives with his mother and works at the fish counter at stop &
shop.  He has a 16 month daughter for whom he is a caretaker
along with his wife.  Social drinker, [**2-2**] ppd smoker x5 years.
States he does not plan to continue smoking.

CTA chest from [**Hospital3 10310**] loaded into PACS system at [**Hospital1 18**]:
(not final): large saddle embolus.  Possible small pulmonary
infarctions of R lung.

ECHO: [**2125-1-1**]
The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. The
right atrial pressure is indeterminate. Premature appearance of
microbubbles are seen in the left atrium with cough (but not
with rest or post-Valsalva release). Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are
normal (LVEF >55%). The right ventricular cavity is mildly
dilated with moderate global free wall hypokinesis. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve appears
structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is
no mitral valve prolapse. There is moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is a small circumferential
pericardial effusion without echocardiographic signs of
tamponade.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2124-12-31**], a
patent foramen ovale is identified on the current study and the
estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is higher. Right
ventricular cavity size/systolic function and the pericardial
effusion are similar.

ECHO: [**2124-12-31**]
The left atrium is normal in size. The right atrial pressure is
indeterminate. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with normal cavity size and global systolic function
(LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall
motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. The right
ventricular cavity is moderately dilated with severe global free
wall hypokinesis. There is abnormal systolic septal
motion/position consistent with right ventricular pressure
overload. The aortic valve leaflets appear structurally normal
with good leaflet excursion. No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral
regurgitation. There is no mitral valve prolapse. There is
atleast mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Right ventricular cavity enlargement with severe
free wall hypokinesis. Pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.

LOWER EXTREMITY ULTRASOUND [**12-31**]:
1. Right lower extremity occlusive thrombus extending from the
mid
superficial femoral vein to the popliteal vein.
2. No evidence of DVT involving the left lower extremity.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr [**Known lastname **] was admitted to the ICU for observation and
transferred to the medicine wards after one day without
complication.  He was not treated with thrombolytic therapy as
his blood pressure remained stable.  His condition continued to
improve with no worsening of symptoms and improving oxygen
saturations at rest and with exertion.  Anticoagulation was well
tolerated therefore an IVC filter was not placed.  He was
observed for 3 days without worsening of symptoms or
complications.  His EKG showed evidence of right heart strain
and a S1Q3T3 pattern on EKG.  Anticoagulation with warfarin was
initiated with INR monitoring as described below:

[**1-4**]: 7.5 mg
[**1-3**]: 7.5 mg
[**1-2**]: 10 mg
[**1-1**]: 10 mg

[**2125-1-4**] INR(PT)-2.8*
[**2125-1-3**] INR(PT)-2.0*
[**2125-1-2**] INR(PT)-1.4*
[**2125-1-1**] INR(PT)-1.5*
[**2124-12-31**] INR(PT)-1.7*
[**2124-12-31**] INR(PT)-1.4*

On the day of discharge he was ambulating without difficulty and
maintaing sats of 92-98% on room air while ambulating.  He has
been scheduled for anticoagulation follow-up on [**1-5**] and
hematology work-up in [**Month (only) 956**].  Of note, Factor V Leiden
testing was performed at [**Hospital3 10310**] prior to this admission
and found to be negative.  In addition to anticoagulation the
patient will require follow-up for his right heart strain.  His
echo findings did reveal a moderately hypokinetic right
ventricle.

Discharge Disposition:
Home

Discharge Diagnosis:
Right lower extremity deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary
embolism.


Discharge Condition:
Stable, saturating 92-98% on RA while ambulating.


Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to our hospital for a right lower leg deep
vein thrombosis (clot) which embolized (migrated) to your lung,
causing you to be short of breath.  You were treated in the ICU
for your compromised respiratory status and anticoagulation to
prevent further propogation of the clot.

It is extremely important for you to continue your
anticoagulation medications at home and follow up with your PCP
and nurse practitioner [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Hospital3 10310**] hospital.  Please
