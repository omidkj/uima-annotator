History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known firstname 18149**] has had on ongoing problems with right frontal
sinusitis.  She has had antibiotic therapy and scans and imaging
studies that were consistent with an encephalocele in her right
frontal ethmoid region.  She does not have any clear fluid
draining out of her nose.  She has not had any evidence of
meningitis as evidenced by stiff neck and unremitting headaches
etc.

Allergies:  Codeine causes rash, aspirin causes trouble
breathing.

MRI scan was reviewed.  This is consistent with given the
history
of sinusitis and the risk of meningitis.  I would plan on
closing
this defect.  This would involve a frontal basal approach and
obliteration of the frontal sinus.  This could be done in
conjunction with ENT.


Past Medical History:
Past medical history is significant for asthma, control
neuralgia, pseudotumor cerebri since [**2173**], gastritis, anemia,
arthritis, tubal ligation and pilonidal cyst.

adjacent mass effect.

since [**Month (only) 958**]
[**2177**].

Ct head [**8-22**]
1.  Increased foci of hyperdensity in the anterior frontal lobes
bilaterally, concerning for increasing hemorrhage, with
surrounding edema.

pneumocephalus, similar compared to prior.
3.  Minimally increased crowding at the skull base without CT
evidence for uncal herniation.

[**8-23**] CT head with angiogram
1.  Stable appearance of multiple hyperdense foci in the
inferior and anterior frontal lobes compatible with hemorrhage
with stable amount of surrounding edema.
2.  Stable postoperative changes with pneumocephalus and mass
effect on the frontal lobes, as well as 6 mm shift of midline
structures to the left.
3.  Stable crowding at the skull base with effacement of the
basal cisterns compatible with descending transtentorial
herniation.
4. No extravasation of contrast, vasospasm, or aneursym.
