History of Present Illness:
65 yo female with h/o of myasthenia [**Last Name (un) 2902**], lung cancer s/p
chemoradiation, HTN, hypercholesterolemia, atrial fibrillation,
and admitted on [**3-25**] for vascular repair of AAA. Pt was on the
vascular service and she was extubated on POD#1 w/o any events.
On [**3-28**] pt developed hyponatremia from 138->123, and weakness,
and medicine was consulted. The medical consult though the
hyponatremia was [**2-9**] SIADH. Over the subsequent days, she was
noted to have generalized weakness and fatigueability. Neurology
was consulted on [**3-30**] and per their note, she complained of limb
weakness, facial weakness marked by difficulty maintaining her
eyes open. VC was 0.95L with NIF of -40 on this date. Neurology
recommended monitoring of NIF and VC, increasing mestinon to
120mg TID. Pt developed worsening weakness despite mestinon and
plasmaphereis was initiated. VC and NIF noted to decrease to
0.90 and -25 respectively. On [**4-1**] pt had worsening weakness
respiratory distress with a RR 18 w/ sat 99% on 2L, NIF -30 and
VC 900cc. She had a weak cough and grade 2-3/5 power in distal
and proximal LE. ABG 7.48/52, and CXR w/ cardiomegaly, RML
fullness but no effisons.
.
In the MICU: Patient had NIFs less than 25 and was intubated on
[**4-1**] and started on SoluMedrol 80mg QD. Extubated on [**4-2**], but
was reintubated on [**4-3**]. Patient underwent a total of 5 days of
plasmapheresis. Pt was extubated on [**4-9**], pt tolerated BiPAP
[**10-17**] that evening. NIF post-intubation was -22, but the next
day did well since and this morning had NIF of -50.
.
Other events:
- [**3-31**] the RIJ triple lumen was changed over a wire
- [**4-5**] completed 3d course of Ctx for UTI
- [**4-6**] vasc changed pheresis line
- [**4-8**] vascular [**Doctor First Name **] was concerned about seeding hardware and
started Ancef - plan to cont until groin wound heels

CT chest [**4-7**]:
1. No thymoma.
2. Moderate-to-severe emphysema.

CXR [**4-10**]:
In comparison with the study of [**4-9**], the endotracheal tube is
not
definitely seen and may have been removed or substantially
pulled back. The IJ catheter and NG tube are essentially
unchanged. The cardiac silhouette is less prominent than on the
previous study and there has been decreased pulmonary congestion
and pleural effusion. No evidence of acute focal pneumonia at
this time.

Brief Hospital Course:
65F with history of MG, admitted for AAA repair, who developed
[**Month/Day (2) 15099**] crisis post-op requiring intubation x 2.

HOSPTIAL COURSE BY PROBLEMS:

#. Respiratory failure [**2-9**] myasthenia flare: Likely related to
post-operative state.  Patient intubated on [**4-1**] for worsening
respiratory distress in post-operative period after elective AAA
repair.  Extubation was done on [**4-2**] requiring reintubation the
following day for muscle weakness. Received plasmapheresis
treatment for 5 days started on [**4-8**]. Pt was extubated on
[**2122-4-9**] and had some increased work of breathing and
post-extubation NIF of -22; however, did well since and the
morning of [**4-12**] had a NIF of -50.  Called out to floor on [**4-12**]
with stable respiratory status.  Pt had nightly CPAP, and NIFs
and VC was followed initially q8 on the floor. Pt's NIF stayed
stable near -50, and VC near 1.3L. She denied any further SOB or
respiratory distress. Pt was transitioned from Solu-Medrol to
prednisone 60mg. The pt will be on prednisone for a long-term
basis. She may be transitioned to 50mg QD after 1mo, but will
have a slow taper. Pt was started on Bactrim 3x/wk for PCP
[**Name9 (PRE) 6187**], and Ca/Vit D. Pt should be continued on CPAP at
nighttime, and NIFs and VC should be checked daily at least for
the 1st week. Pt should also receive nebs as needed, and suction
as needed.

#. Myasthenia [**Name (NI) **] - Pt had muscle weakness and severe
fatigability that is now resolving. In the ICU pt did have mild
ptosis bilaterally though will open eyes fully on command, a
slightly weak shoulder shrug, weak gag. Her upper extremities
[**4-12**] bilaterally proximally and distally. Lower extremties [**3-12**] at
the hip and [**4-12**] at ankle. Sensation was grossly intact. While in
MICU, patient had 5 runs of plasmapheresis which she tolerated
well, and continued on the mestinon.  Her strength continued to
improve daily and was extubated without complications.
Evaluated by CT surgery with CT scan which did not show thymoma.
 CT surgery will plan to eval for thymectomy at later date. On
the floor, her illopsoas was still [**4-12**] b/l, but at time of
discharge her motor exam was [**5-12**] b/l UE and LE w/ no ptosis or
diplopia. Pt was on TF while her PO intake was small. She had a
video swallow and passed. Her dobhoff was removed. Currently she
now on a regular diet, and nutrition recommended at least for
the next few days to have smaller but more frequent meals to
avoid fatiguing, and to continue ensure TID until caloric intake
is adqeuete. Pt is to be continued. Pt should be contiued on
pyridostigmine 60mg TID, and was also started on Cellcept by
neurology to decrease frequen
