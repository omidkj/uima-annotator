EKG: ventricular escape rhthm at 45. RBBB. TWI III, AVF (new).

Relevant Imaging:
1)Cxray ([**11-16**]): Limited study.  No obvious pneumonia,
pneumothorax, or pleural effusion detected in these conditions.
Apical redistribution of pulmonary blood flow. A repeat chest
radiograph in a true AP projection is recommended for better
delineation, as well as to better assess heart size.

2)Lower extremity U/S ([**11-16**]): No evidence of bilateral lower
extremity deep venous thrombosis.

3)ECHO ([**11-17**]):The left atrium is moderately dilated. Left
ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and systolic function
are normal (LVEF>55%). Regional left ventricular wall motion is
normal. The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated. Right
ventricular systolic function is normal. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
present. No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve.
No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
moderately thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Severe [4+] tricuspid
regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

4)RUE U/S ([**11-20**]): Limited study of the right upper extremity,
without intraluminal thrombus is identified. The right internal
jugular and medial right subclavian veins were not examined as
described.

5)Cxray ([**11-23**]):There was considerable rotation of the patient
to the right, thereby making difficult comparisons of heart size
with prior films. The left-sided pacemaker with its single
ventricular lead seems unchanged in position. There has been
interval placement of a right-sided PICC line, with its tip at
the level of the mid or central portion of the superior vena
cava. Bibasilar small pleural effusions are present, left worse
than right.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 63845**] is a 80 yo female with a history of CRI, chronic
AF on Coumadin, diastolic CHF who presents in ARF, bradycardia,
hyperkalemia, uremic symptoms, and possible LE cellulitis.
Hyperkalemia resolved and renal failure improving slowly with
IVFs. Had been 100% transvenous paced, now s/p permanent
pacemaker placement.

1) Rhythm: Patient has history of Chronic AF and became
bradycardic in the setting of severe renal failure and
hyperkalemia. Patient was discharged on Atenolol on her last
admission, which is renally excreted, and became bradycardic as
her creatinine increased. In the ED, she was given Atropine with
a minimal response and a temporary pacer was placed in the EP
lab. Her anti-hypertensives, diuretics, and Coumadin were held.
Her pacer rate was initially set at 60 but slowly increased to
80, which she tolerated. Heparin gtt was started for
anti-coagulation but was held because she had significant
epistaxis and hematuria. She was followed closely by EP and a
permanent single chamber pacemaker was placed with no
complications. She was treated with 3 days of Vancomycin, per
EP. She will need follow-up with EP and the device clinic. Would
recommend no atenolol given h/o renal dysfunction, instead give
metoprolol if requires restart of beta-blocker.

2) Pump: Patient has EF >55%, severe tricuspid regurgitation,
likely diastolic dysfunction. She takes Lasix and Spironolactone
at home, both of which were stopped given her renal failure and
dehydration. She is extremely edematous on exam but is likely
intravascularly depleted given her elevated BUN and dry mucous
membranes on clinical exam. Patient was started on maintenance
fluids several times during her hospital stay given her poor
intake. She also required multiple fluid boluses to maintain her
blood pressure. Would recommend to continue holding all
diuretics for now despite peripheral ede
