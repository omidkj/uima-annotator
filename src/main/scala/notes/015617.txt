History of Present Illness:
70 y/o F with a PMHx of pancreatic CA s/p Whipple [**2133**] with
recent metastatic recurrence to liver, lungs, bone presented to
[**Hospital1 2436**] today with progressive SOB. Two weeks she developed
the acute onset of right shoulder pain and was found on CXR to
have diffuse pulmonary mets thought to be due to a recurrence of
her pancreatic CA. She was to follow up with her oncologist when
she noticed the progressive onset of SOB and fatigue. She went
into [**Hospital1 2436**] today and had a CTA which showed a PE in her RUL
PA as well as her L pulmonary vein. She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]
for further management.

In the ED, her VS were: temp 98.1, HR 72, BP 145/65, RR 18
97%2L.


Past Medical History:
1) Pancreatic CA s/p Whipple [**2133**] at [**Hospital1 336**]; recently found to
recur with mets to bone, spine, lungs, liver
2) NIDDM

Pertinent Results:
LENIs [**6-4**]: No evidence of DVT

CXR [**6-4**]: Limited examination demonstrating left pleural
effusion with atelectasis, as well as possible right lung
"pseudotumor" versus true parenchymal mass and possible
lymphangitic carcinomatosis.

TTE [**6-5**]:  The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular
wall thickness, cavity size, and systolic function are normal
(LVEF>55%). Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal.
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial mitral
regurgitation is seen. The left ventricular inflow pattern
suggests impaired relaxation. The tricuspid valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could
not be determined. There is a moderate sized pericardial
effusion, with the greatest amount of fluid apically. There is
brief right atrial diastolic collapse and early (brief) RV
diastolic invagination. There is significant, accentuated
respiratory variation in mitral/tricuspid valve inflows,
consistent with impaired ventricular filling.


Brief Hospital Course:
70 y/o F with a PMHx of pancreatic CA s/p Whipple [**2133**] with
recent metastatic recurrence to liver, lungs, bone found to
bilateral PEs and pericardial effusion.  After a week long
hospital course, the patient was eventually discharged home with
hospice.

1. PE: Pt with a recent diagnosis of metastatic recurrence of
pancreatic CA to bone, liver, lungs, pleura.  Has developed
progressive DOE; found to have bilateral PEs as well as
pericardial effusion.  Given the concern for a likely
hemorrhagic pericardial effusion in the setting of her
pancreatic CA, was not anticoagulated.  Had negative LENIs which
did not show any evidence of large clot burden in LEs.  Given
inability to anticoagulate, was taken for IVC filter placement
on [**6-6**].  Further decision to anticoagulate was deferred to
heme/onc.

2. Pericardial Effusion: Likely malignant effusion from
pancreatic CA.  Had TTE on [**6-5**] which showed early tamponade
physiology, but patient was HD stable during her ICU stay.  Was
evaluated by CT surgery and cardiology and given concern for
recurrent pericardial effusion from likely malignant effusion,
was taken for a pericardial window on [**6-6**].  Chest tube was
placed to water seal on and eventually removed.  Pericardial
fluid cytology was negative for malignant cells.

3. DM: Held metformin while inpt and covered with RISS. She was
restarted on metformin upon discharge.

4. HTN: The patient antihypertensives were held on admission
given concern for pericardial effusion.  Her blood pressure
remained stable and he prior medications were never restarted.

5. PNA: The patient developed a RML PNA and was treated with a
14 day course of levofloxacin/flagyl.

6. Pancreatic CA s/p Whipple now recurred: Metastatic pancreatic
CA to bone, liver, lungs.  Was not a candidate for palliative
chemo given diffuse metastatic disease.  Was seen by oncology
who agreed with holding off on anticoagulation and treating with
IVC filter placement.  The patient and her family met with the
palliative care team and they decided that discharging to home
with hospice care would be the best for the patient.  She was
discharged with to home on [**2137-6-12**] with hospice care.

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to the hospital with bilateral pulmonary
embolisms, otherwise described as blood clots in the vessels of
both your lungs.  This was making it very difficult for you to
breathe.  You had a filter placed in your IVC to prevent further
clots from getting into your lung.

In addition, you were found to have bilateral pleural effusion
(which is fluid between the two linings of your lungs), as well
as a pericardial effusion (which is fluid between the two
linings of your heart).  To drain the fluid around your heart,
the thoracic surgeons inserted a chest tube into the space
between the linings of your heart.  This tube was taken out
prior to your leaving the hospital.

Later, you developed a fever, which was likely due to an
infection in your lungs, which we treated with antibiotics.  We
are giving you antibiotics to finish at home.  You need to
LEVOFLOXACIN 500mg once a day for another 6 days.  You need to
take FLAGYL/METRONIDAZOLE 500mg thr
