None

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 79627**] is a 63 yo M with history of COPD (2L home O2 at
night), schizophrenia, pulmonary hypertension admitted with
progressively worsening dyspnea and hypoxia.  Of note he was
recently admitted [**Date range (1) 17777**] for COPD exacerbation and
pneumonia for which he was treated with levofloxacin x5 days and
prednisone taper decreasing by 10mg q2 days.  He has been
followed by VNA daily since his recent discharge and was sent in
for O2 of 86% on RA, normally 90-92%.  Per report from VNA he
was taking steroids at home, antibiotic course was completed on
the day following discharge.  He report that he has had
increasing dypnea and chest tightness for the past 4-5 days
although it is difficult to elicit details about how he has been
feeling.  He denies fever, nausea, vomiting, light headedness,
syncope, diarrhea, abdominal discomfort.
.
On arrival in the ED T99.4 BP 102/61 HR 109  99% on NRB.  He was
given albuterol/atrovent nebs and noted to be more somnolent in
the ED, was changed from NRB to 2L NC with improvement in mental
status.  ABG was drawn which was similar to baseline 7.37/58/73
on 2LNC.  He did have period of hypotension with BP 95/p.  He
was given 1.5L NS, vancomycin 1g IV, zosyn 4.5g IV and
prednisone 60g po.  He was also sent for CTA given hypotension
and mild tachycardia.  He was also started on BIPAP.
.
On arrival to the ICU he appears well and reports that he is
feeling significantly better than when he first got to the ED.
He was changed over from BIPAP to 2L NC upon arrival.

.
[**2160-1-1**] CXR Opacity seen within the right lower lobe may
represent resolving pneumonia; however, a recurrence cannot be
excluded. However, this is less likely given incongruity with
clinical findings. No new areas of consolidation seen.
.
[**1-2**] CXR: Previously reported right basilar opacities are
improving with minimal residual infrahilar opacities remaining
with associated bronchial wall thickening and mild volume loss.
New peribronchiolar opacities have developed in the left
retrocardiac region and may represent acute aspiration,
atelectasis, or an early focus of pneumonia. Heart size remains
normal. Prominence of the hila appear unchanged, possibly due to
prominent pulmonary vasculature, but standard PA and lateral
radiographs would be helpful prior to discharge for more
complete assessment when the patient's condition permits.
.
CHEST (PA & LAT) Study Date of [**2160-1-3**] 9:13 AM The lungs are
hyperinflated and the diaphragms are flattened, consistent with
COPD. The heart is not enlarged. There is mild unfolding of the
ascending aorta. There is patchy opacity in the right infrahilar
region and to a lesser extent in the lingula. There is minimal
blunting of the right costophrenic
angle. IMPRESSION: Patchy opacity right infrahilar region worse
than on [**2160-1-1**], consistent with pneumonia. Patchy opacity also
in the left lingular region, probably unchanged allowing for
technique. Please note that followup to resolution is
recommended to exclude a neoplastic or other chronic infiltrate.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 79627**] is a 63 yo M with history of COPD (2L home O2 at
night), schizophrenia, pulmonary hypertension admitted to MICU
with progressively worsening dyspnea. His MICU course was
uncomplicated and he was transfered to the floor for further
management. On the floor he remained hypoxic but reporting he
was at baseline. Ultimately he was discharged with followup with
pulmonary medicine on a steroid taper and abx for concern of
PNA. VNA is scheduled to see him and do home pulmonary PT. He
may eventually need inpatient pulm. PT if he can tolerate it.
.
# Respiratory distress: Most likely [**3-10**] COPD exacerbation;
initial ABG relatively similar to his baseline, second overnight
with slight worsening. CXR equivocal for worsening pneumonia.
Significant worsening of leukocytosis on admission which is
improving off ABx. Steroids: prednisone 60 for a total of 5 days
and taper by 10mg daily every other day. So 60mg to [**2160-1-5**],
11/30-12/0 50mg, and so forth. With the help of pulmonary
consult he was discharged on anticholinergics, inhaled steroids,
and beta agonists. Was on azithromycin initially but switching
to levofloxacin 750mg PO daily D1 [**2160-1-4**] for worsening R
perihilar opacity on interval CXR concerning for PNA. Continue
levofloxacin to [**2160-1-10**]. Goal O2 sats were 90-93% given COPD and
baseline retention. Desat to 77% with ambulation which is worse
than baseline by report. 90% at rest. ABG at rest on room air
was 7.38/62/56. Discharged with 24hr O2 at home.
.
# Leukocytosis - significantly elevated to 38.4 on admission
from 15 on [**2159-12-25**] at time of discharge. Some improvement
today. Possibly [**3-10**] to steroids, also consider infection with
most likely sources being recurrence of pneumonia vs C.diff
given recent antibiotics. Given CXR on [**2160-1-3**] concerning for
PNA switched to levofloxacin. This is a good explanation for his
leukocytosis.
.
# Schizophrenia: stable. Continued olanzapine.
.
# Tobacco abuse - readressed importance of tobacco cessation in
preventing progression of COPD and helping to decrease future
infections/hospitalizations.
Was discharged on continuous O2 and warned about the risks of
oxygen and smoking. Given nicotine patch

Medications on Admission:
Olanzapine 5 mg Tablet qd
Fluticasone-Salmeterol 250-50 mcg/Dose one INH [**Hospital1 **]
