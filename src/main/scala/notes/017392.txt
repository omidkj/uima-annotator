General: Obese man, intubated and sedated but awakens to voice,
moving around in bed.

Heart: RR, no m/g/r
Lungs: Diffusely rhonchorous anterolaterally
Abd: Distended, NABS, not deeply palpated due to recent
Ext: 2+ dps, obese, 1+ pitting edema

Pertinent Results:
[**2177-9-29**] CXR: Abnormally dense and widened mediastinum. Per
report, there has been no intervention in this area, thus making
the possibility of hematoma unlikely in the absence of
coagulopathy. This appearance could be caused by lymphadenopathy
or mediastinal lipomatosis. Dedicated PA and lateral chest
radiographs are recommended for initial further evaluation when
this is possible. Alternatively, CT could be obtained.
.
[**10-1**] CXR: AP chest compared to [**9-30**] and [**10-1**] at 2:00
a.m.:
Endotracheal tube tip is at the thoracic inlet, cuff is
overinflated and should be evaluated clinically for appropriate
settings. Lung volumes remain low with less differential
elevation of the right hemidiaphragm following intubation.
Pulmonary edema is new. Mild cardiomegaly is stable. Nasogastric
tube passes into the stomach and out of view. No pneumothorax or
substantial pleural effusion.
.
[**2177-10-1**] Right upper extremity u/s: No evidence of DVT.

Brief Hospital Course:
[**Date range (3) 106999**]
The pt was admitted and taken to the OR for the above noted
procedures. Per the operative report, "the patient was not able
to be extubated at the conclusion of the procedure but was
breathing spontaneously on a T-piece to the recovery room, awake
with stable vital signs." The pt was taken to the [**Hospital Ward Name 332**] ICU.
The pt was maintained intubated and sedated. He was unable to be
extubated to high FiO2 requirements and PEEP requirement due to
assumed increase in intraabdominal pressure translating to
increased intrathoracic pressure. He was extubated but then
re-intubated due to CO2=100 and pH=7.12 per Anesthesia. The pt's
temperature rose to 101.2 with a WBC=27 on [**2177-10-1**]. Sputum,
urine and blood cultures were taken which were negative except
for one blood culture.  This culture was felt to be contaminated
as all others were negative. He was started on Vancomycin and
Zosyn empirically but this was later d'ced upon resolution of
fevers, WBC and negative cultures.  Once FiO2 and PEEP
requirements stabilized he was extubated without complications.
He was therefore transferred to floor status without incident.
He was maintained on antibiotics and fevers and WBC declined.
He continued to remain stable on the floor with good JP output.
His JP drains were therefore kept in place and he was discharged
to rehab with po keflex while JP drains are present, dressing
changes prn and will f/u with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in one week.
