Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**Doctor First Name 1402**]
Chief Complaint:
Cardiac arrest

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardioversion
Intubation


History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 76 year old male with a history of CAD s/p
CABG, HTN, AF, syncope s/p PPM who presents following
out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. The patient has been noted to be
slightly dysnpic over the last two days. He has not experienceid
any chest pain, palpitations, light-headnedness, or any other
symtpoms. On the day of presenation, the patient went out to do
errands. He had spoken to his wife pulling into a wall-mart
parking lot, and did not make any notable complaints. He was
found down in the parking lot unresponsive. The event was
unwitnessed. Security was called, who placed an AED on the
patient, and fired twice for a shockable rhythm. EMS was
activated. From being found down to confirmation of a purfusing
rhythm, the estimated time down is roughly ten minutes.
He was intubated in the field and transfered to [**Hospital3 6592**].

.
While there, the patient was noted to be hemodynapically stable.
A CT scan of the head and neck were performed, and reportadly
normal. The patients wife says that at [**Name (NI) **] the patient was
squeezing hands on command and was intially grabing at lines
with purposeful movement of all for extremities. He was
emergently transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] for futher evaluation and care.
.
In the ED, the patient's HR was 72, BP 137/74, satting 100% on
the ventillator. He was give IV versed for sedation. He was
noted to have BRB in the anal vault. The patient was transfered
to the CCU for further care.
.
On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
He denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other
review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,
ankle edema, palpitations, or presyncope

Studies/Imaging:
.
CXR [**11-28**] -
FINDINGS: Single AP chest radiograph without comparison shows ET
tube
terminating 3.6 cm above the carina. The lungs are clear. The
heart is
moderately enlarged. The patient is status post median
sternotomy and CABG.
There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. NG-tube is in
satisfactory
position with tip in the stomach. Leads of a right-sided
pacemaker terminate
in the right atrium and ventricle. Surgical staple overlies the
left upper
abdomen.

IMPRESSION: Moderate cardiomegaly without evidence of pneumonia
or overt CHF.
.
CTA [**11-28**] -
IMPRESSION:

1. No pulmonary embolism or thoracic aortic dissection.

2. Small-to-moderate bibasilar consolidation with aspiration
favored over
pneumonia.

3. Small amount of secretions surrounding the proximally
visualized
endotracheal tube.

4. Dilated ascending thoracic aorta
.
ECHO [**11-28**]:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is mildly
dilated. There is severe regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction with inferior, inferolateral and basal inferoseptal
akinesis (likely RCA territory). There is moerate to severe
hypokinesis of the remaining segments (LVEF = 15-20%). The right
ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with borderline normal free
wall function. The aortic root is moderately dilated at the
sinus level. The ascending aorta is moderately dilated. The
descending thoracic aorta is mildly dilated. There are three
moderately thickened aortic leaflets, with poor excursion.
Two-dimensional imaging suggests significant aortic stenosis,
but its severity cannot be reliably quantified given low LV
stroke volume. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Moderate [2+]
tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Severe regional and global left ventricular systolic
dysfunction, suggestive of a global process (toxic, metabolic,
etc.) on a background of prior inferior myocardial infarction.
Mild right ventricular systolic dysfunction. Significant aortic
stenosis. Moderate tricuspid regurgitation. Mild pulmonary
hypertension. Dilated thoracic aorta.
.
ECHO [**12-8**]:
.
The left atrium is dilated. There is an inferobasal left
ventricular aneurysm. There is severe regional left ventricular
systolic dysfunction with akinesis of the inferior,
inferolateral segments. The other segments are moderately
hypokinetic. There is no left ventricular outflow obstruction at
rest or with Valsalva. Th
