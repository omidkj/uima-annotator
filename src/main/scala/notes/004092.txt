shortness of breath

PICC line placement


History of Present Illness:
77M with hx of COPD, recent admit for COPD flare, ARF (d/c
[**1-20**]), afib, CHF sent to ED from [**Hospital1 1501**] with severe shortness of
breath and desaturation to 86%. Pt states that this am, he woke
up and was feeling well. He got up to go the bathroom but needed
to take his oxygen off because it would not reach. When he got
back from the bathroom, he was severely short of breath. He put
his oxygen back on but it did not help. He states that he could
hear himself wheezing. Later, he again got up to go to the
bathroom and had to take off his O2. Once again, he became
severely short of breath. This time, he sat in his chair because
that makes his breathing better but his O2 does not reach to the
chair. He felt very short of breath and [**Doctor Last Name **] for his nurse. His
O2 sat was checked and found to be 86% on RA. Nursing home notes
state that pt has been coughing up blood tinged sputum. pt
states he has a chronic cough productive of dark brown sputum.
Her cannot walk more than 3 feet without stopping to rest. He
denies chest pain, palpitations.

In ED, CXR showed RUL pneumonia and pt was given levaquin and
nebs.

CXR ([**2114-1-30**]): There is no significant interval change in
multifocal patchy opacities bilaterally since multiple prior
exams, including chest CT dated [**2114-1-26**].  The pulmonary
vasculature is normal.  There is no pneumothorax.  Tiny
bilateral pleural effusions are slightly smaller than one day
earlier.  The cardiac silhouette, mediastinal and hilar contours
are stable.  The surrounding soft tissue and osseous structures
are unremarkable.
.
[**2114-1-26**] CT-chest w/o contrast.
IMPRESSION:
1. Poorly defined patchy and nodular airspace opacities seen
bilaterally suggesting multifocal pneumonia. Followup imaging
following treatment to document resolution is recommended.
2. Small bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left.
3. Pleural calcifications bilaterally, suggesting prior asbestos
exposure.
4. Diffuse coronary artery calcifications and atherosclerotic
calcifications noted within the aorta.
.
ECHO [**2114-1-16**]:
The left and right atria are moderately dilated. The estimated
right atrial pressure is 16-20 mmHg. Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity size, and systolic function are normal
(LVEF>55%). Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. The
right ventricular cavity is dilated. Right ventricular systolic
function is normal. There are three aortic valve leaflets. The
aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is mild
aortic valve stenosis (area 1.2-1.9cm2). No aortic regurgitation
is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The
mitral regurgitation jet is eccentric. Moderate to severe [3+]
tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is severe pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension.
.
EKG ([**2114-1-29**]): afib at 87 bpm, LAD, flattened T waves in I,
borderline IVCD with left bundyloid pattern; flipped T waves in
avL; no ST changes; overall unchanged from prior tracing [**2114-1-28**].


Brief Hospital Course:
77-yo-man w/ COPD, afib, diastolic CHF, anemia, CKD, admitted
with PNA.  He had recently been discharged [**2114-1-19**] after a COPD
exacerbation treated with steroids.  He is status post MICU stay
for hypoxia/respiratory distress.
.
# Hypoxia/Resp distress: This was though to be multifactorial,
due to PNA, COPD, and diastolic CHF.  His acute dyspnea that
resulted in ICU transfer was felt due to volume overload, and
improved after diuresis with IV lasix.  He was diuresed with IV
lasix, treated with IV antibiotics (see below), and round the
clock nebulizers.
.
# PNA:  This was multilobar, noted both on chest x-ray and
non-contrast CT scan of the chest.  Blood cultures had no growth
(final).  Initial sputum culture was contaminated and repeat
grew oropharyngeal flora (not speciated).  Initially he was
placed on levofloxacin, with vancomycin added 24 hours later.
The pneumonia was complicated by CHF and COPD exacerbations, so
his progress was slow.  After 6 days of levofloxacin and 5 days
of vancomycin, his coverage was broadened to Zosyn instead of
Levofloxacin for presumed nosocomial pneumonia, acquired at the
nursing home.  Vanco was continued.   He remains afebrile and
his WBC normalized.  He should receive an additional 7 days of
Vancomycin and Zosyn.  He should follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] (his
primary care physician) in [**12-26**] weeks.
.
# COPD: The patient has no PFTs on record, but he has had a
constant O2 requirement since his last discharge on [**1-19**] of 3L
nasal cannula.    His COPD was likely exacerbated by his PNA.
He was continued on Advair and placed on a more extended
prednisone taper (he should begin 20mg x 7 days on [**2114-2-4**],
tapered to 10mg daily for 7 days, then to 5mg daily x 7 days,
then off).  He should continue nebulizers, atrovent q6H and
albuterol q4H).  Once his acute flair has improved, he should be
referred for outpatient PFTs.
.
# Atrial fibrillation: The patient was rate controlled on
diltiazem which was continued. Coumadin was stopped during his
last admission due to hematuria.  He was continued on aspirin.
B-blocker was not given as not to exacerbate his COPD.
.
# DM type 2: The patient was diet controlled until
