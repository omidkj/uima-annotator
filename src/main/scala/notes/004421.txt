Service:  Medical Intensive Care Unit

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Apnea, status post percutaneous endoscopic
gastrostomy tube replacement

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Ms [**Known lastname **] is an 85 year old
nursing home patient with a past medical history significant
for stroke, hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease who came in on [**11-2**], for a percutaneous
endoscopic gastrostomy tube replacement.  The patient was
intubated for the procedure and after the procedure the
patient was extubated and was maintaining good oxygen
saturation of about 92 to 94% on 2 liters of oxygen through
the nasal cannula.  All of a sudden the patient became apneic
and a chest x-ray was obtained which showed a right upper
lung collapse which appeared to be secondary to some
bronchial mucous plugging.  At that time it was decided to
reintubate the patient and the patient was reintubated and a
bronchoscopy was done and a significant amount of
secretion/bronchial mucous plugging was removed.  A repeat
chest x-ray was done which showed reinflation of the right
upper lobe after the bronchoscopy.  At that time the patient
was in the Post Anesthesia Care Unit.  In addition, the
patient also became very hypotensive and was started on
Lopressor, Neo, 1 mcg/kg/min and her blood pressure improved
from systolic of 60s to 70s to 110s.  The patient also has a
history of Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus
colonization in the past and so the surgery team who did the
percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube replacement
contact[**Name (NI) **] the [**Name (NI) **] Intensive Care Unit and asked the
patient to be transferred to the [**Name (NI) **] Intensive Care Unit
for further workup and evaluation.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Left atrial myxoma, stroke,
hypertension, recurrent pneumonia, chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease, diverticulosis, breast cancer, status post
left mastectomy, questionable gastric cancer, hiatal hernia,
left proximal humeral fracture, status post wide cataract
surgery.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Trazodone 50 mg p.o. q.d., Paxil
20 mg p.o. q.d., Aspirin 81 mg p.o. q.d., Neurontin 600 mg
p.o. t.i.d., Calcium carbonate 650 mg p.o. b.i.d., Albuterol,
Atrovent nebulizers, Timoptic 0.5%, Xalatan 0.005%,
multivitamin one tablet p.o. q.d.

ALLERGIES:  Digoxin and Erythromycin

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Physical examination on admission, in
general the patient was intubated, was awake and responded to
some verbal commands.  Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat,
pupils equal, round and reactive to light and accommodation.
Jugulovenous distension is flat, no lymphadenopathy noted.
Lungs, mild wheezing in the bilateral lower lobes.  Heart, S1
and S2, regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs, rubs or gallops
heard.  Abdomen, soft, nondistended, nontender, no
hepatosplenomegaly noted.  Positive percutaneous endoscopic
gastrostomy tube on the left side.  Extremities, no edema, no
cyanosis and no clubbing, 2+ distal pulses.

LABORATORY DATA:  On admission white count was 24.9,
hematocrit 41.7, platelets 542, sodium 135, potassium 4.6,
chloride 98, bicarbonate 25, BUN 27, creatinine 1.0, glucose
274, calcium 9.0, phosphorus 6.6, magnesium 2.0, PT 12.6, PTT
26.9, INR 1.1.

Electrocardiogram, normal sinus rhythm, sinus tachycardiac to
110s, no ST elevation noted, normal intervals.  Chest x-ray,
no evidence of pneumothorax, resolution of right upper lung
collapse as compared to the previous x-ray that was done
prior to the reintubation.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Pulmonary, the patient was initially
intubated for the procedure.  After the procedure the patient
was extubated but became apneic and her oxygen saturation
dropped and her chest x-ray showed a right upper lobe
collapse, and so the patient was reintubated and a
bronchoscopy was done with a significant amount of mucous
clubbing, secretions were removed.  A repeat chest x-ray
after the bronchoscopy showed reinflation of the right upper
lobe.  An attempt was made on [**11-5**], to extubate the
patient but the patient failed secondary to increase of
secretions and at that time it was also thought to volume
overload.  The patient was receiving a significant amount of
fluid boluses because of the patient was hypotension, and as
we were trying to wean off of the pressor, she was getting
more and more fluid.  After the failure of extubation on
[**11-5**], it was decided to extensively diurese the patient
and treat the patient for her secretions.  Initially the
patient was on assist control but then she would be switched
over to pressor support of 15 or pressor support of 10,
positive end-expiratory pressure of 5, FIO2 of 35% and the
patient would tolerate that well.  However, whenever an
attempt was made to wean her off of mechanical ventilation by
lowering the pressor support to 5, the patient would become
tachypneic, tachycardiac and the title volumes would decrease
and the patient would not tolerate that very well.  Despite
multiple attempts to wean off of her mechanical ventilation
an extensive discussion was held with the family in which it
was decided that if we would try to extubate her one more
time and she would fail extubation, what would be the next
thing to do.  At that time her two sons, [**Name (NI) **] and [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **]
[**Name (NI) **], had reached an agreement to go ahead and extubate
the patient and if the patient would fail extubation we would
make her comfortable but they would not want her to go ahead
with any trach at that point.  On [**2143-11-13**] at around
10:15 AM the patient was extubated and after extubation the
patient was doing well.  Her oxygen saturations were 96 to
98% on 2 liters through the nasal cannula

Cardiovascular - Rate and rhythm, the patient was mostly
normal sinus rhythm and would get occasional premature atrial
contractions and premature ventricular contractions.
Electrolytes would need to be rechecked and repeated as
needed.  Ischemia, no ischemic changes or signs noted on
electrocardiogram.  Pump, the patient was initially on a
pressor, Neo 1 mcg/kg/min, however, that was weaned off
within a day or two after the patient transferred to the
[**Year (4 digits) **] Intensive Care Unit.  The patient also received
multiple fluid boluses to help her maintain her blood
pressure.

Infectious disease - The patient is known to have a baseline
white blood cell count between the range of 9 to 11.
Initially on admission to the [**Year (4 digits) **] Intensive Care Unit
her white count was 25.6.  At that time we decided to start
her on broad coverage of Levofloxacin and Flagyl for
questionable aspiration pneumonia since she did have the
bronchial plugging that lead to the right upper lung
collapse.  However, that was discontinued in one day or two
when the white count came down significantly.  At that time
it was thought that the reason why she had a elevated white
count of 25.6 was probably secondary to the stressfulness of
the procedure.  In addition, the patient was also started on
Vancomycin initially at 1 gm q. 12 hours for her known
Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus colonization.  A
Vancomycin trough level was obtained which was slightly
elevated and so based on the pharmacy recommendations, her
Vancomycin was changed to 1 gm q. 24 hours.  In addition on
[**11-7**], the patient was also started on Cefepime 2 mg
intravenously q. 12 for pseudomonas coverage since her sputum
grew out mild to moderate pseudomonas aeruginosa which was
sensitive to Cefepime and mild to moderate
Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.

Gastrointestinal - The patient is questionable status post
gastric cancer, needs further verification.  The patient has
a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube placed.  Dressings
were changed as per protocol and the patient has been
receiving tube feeds through that without any difficulty.

Heme - Hematocrit had fallen from 40 to 29.  It was initially
thought that this drastic fall is secondary to overhydration
since the patient was becoming hypotensive.  Iron studies
were obtained which were found to be unremarkable.  Since
then her hematocrit had been in the
