Portable AP chest radiograph was compared to [**2108-12-28**].

Significant interval improvement of widespread right lung
opacities as well as left lung perihilar linear opacities have
been demonstrated, consistent with interval resolution of
pulmonary edema. Small left retrocardiac consolidation is still
present and might represent focus of infection versus
atelectasis.  Cardiomegaly is moderate, unchanged. The NG tube
tip is in the stomach. The ET tube tip is 3.4 cm above the
carina. The right-sided pacemaker leads terminate in right
atrium and right ventricle. No appreciable pneumothorax is
present. Left pleural effusion is most likely small to moderate
in size.

OSH HEAD CT: majority of L MCA territory hypodense, foci of
increased density within the territory, largest area is
subinsular (2x0.8cm) c/w acute blood. Chronic lacune R thalamus,
R cerebellum. Extensive L hemisphere edema but not mass effect
or
hernation.

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient is a 75yo man with vascular risk factors and CHF s/p
pacemaker who was found unresponsive at home and initially taken
to an outside hospital where head CT revealed large L MCA
infarct with hemorrhagic transformation.  It was dense/entire L
MCA infarct and he had minimal exam findings including being
unresponsive even to sternal rub.

He was transferred intubated but upon discussion with family,
goal of care of changed to maximize comfort and patient was
extubated then transferred to the floor with comfort measures
only.

Patient was seen and family met with palliative care and case
management and patient is discharged to nursing home with
hospice care including morphine sublingual for comfort.  The
patient was found to be unresponsive at 2:45am on [**1-1**] and was
pronounced deceased at that time.  Death exam documented in
chart. His family was notified.
