Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Allopurinol / Colchicine

Attending:[**Name (NI) 9308**]
Chief Complaint:
chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
s/p PCI with DES to LAD


History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 97612**] is a very pleasant 89 yo female with history with
PMH of CAD with a stent 9 years ago, HTN, hypothyroidism,
arthritis, dementia who presents with chest pain that started
yesterday. She describes the pain as chest "heaviness" that
occured int he past 24 hours. The last time she had chest
discomfort was approximately 7 AM this morning; she did not want
to worry her children by going directly to the [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] she went
to her PCP's office; her PCP subsequently referred her to the
emergency department.
.
In the ED, initial vitals were 70, 137/53, 19, 97% on RA
Labs and imaging significant for ST elevation on V2-V4. The
patient was started on a heparin gtt and sent up the floor. She
had already received a full dose of aspirin earlier in the day.
Her ED labs were notable for Trop-T: 0.37, with CK: 196 MB: 13.
On floor, she had ECHO that showed mild regional LV systolic
dysfunction with hypokinesis of the mid and distal anterior
septum and apex with normal free wall contractility. Trace
aortic regurgitation is seen. Mild to moderate ([**12-17**]+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is a trivial/physiologic
pericardial effusion.  Given the symptoms, positive enzymes, EKG
changes, Echo with regional changes, she underwent PCI with Cath
showed right dominant, LMCA 70% distal, LAD 95% ISR in
mid-vessel 60% major diag, LCX and RCA free of disease. PCI'ed
with DES. RFA angiosealed.
.
Of note, patient recently undergone a femur surgery 4 weeks ago,
and that after her surgery she has been using a walker more
frequently, which has been causing her shoulder pain for the
past week or so.
.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS
On review of systems, she denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, hemoptysis, black stools
or red stools. She denies recent fevers, chills or rigors. She
denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other review
of systems were negative. Notable for pain in her shoulders over
the past month.
.
She does endorse a cough recently which she has attributed to
some post-nasal drip, which she has had for the past two days.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,
palpitations, syncope or presyncope. The patient does endorse
some increase in ankle edema in the past month.
.
On arrival to the floor, the patient relays that she had
recently undergone a femur surgery 4 weeks ago, and that after
her surgery she has been using a walker more frequently, which
has been causing her shoulder pain for the past week or so.
However, starting yesterday, she endorsed a sense of
"indigestion" and heaviness in her chest. She denied any
associated symptoms of nausea, vomiting, diaphoresis, or
shortenss of breath.
