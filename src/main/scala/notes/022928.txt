Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4327**]
Chief Complaint:
SOB

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **] y/o w CAD w recent PCI to LMCA for in-stent restenosis c/b
ischemic cardiomyopathy EF 20% recently discharged from CCU,
here with worsening SOB. She states since being home for the
past three days, she has been feeling weak and has been gotten
progressively more short of breath. Also reports chills this
morning. States that this shortness of breath is different from
her CHF exacerbation shortness of breath but got her into the
hospital last week. Denies chest pain, headache, dysuria,
nausea, vomiting.

In the ED, initial vitals were 0 98 130 140/77 26 100%. EKG
showed QTc 460, low-voltage EKG, prolonged QTc, Q waves III/aVF,
TW flattening, residual STE V2-V3. CXR showed bilateral pleural
effusions suggestive of pulmonary edema vs. infection. Labs
notable for trop 0.09, Na 130, Cr 1.0, BNP [**Numeric Identifier 109445**], WBC normal at
6.4, INR 1.4, lactate 3.4, UA with mod blood and many bacteria.
Received ASA, vancomycin and levofloxacin. Placed on BIPAP and
received 40mg IV lasix. Blood cultures were sent. Vitals on
transfer were 97.0 95 100/77 25 100%.

Of note patient was d/c'ed on [**10-13**] after admission for chest
pain. Urgent coronary angiography on [**2110-10-10**] demonstrated severe
restenosis (80%) of the previous BMS from the distal LMCA into
the LAD so a DES was placed inside the previous stent.  Post
PCI, no remaining stenosis of LAD, prx LMCA lesion (40%), prx
LCx lesion (60%) Unchanged from [**7-8**].  The RCA was not injected
(normal in [**7-8**]). She was monitored in the CCU post-procedure
given her hx of hemopericardium. Post-procedure she had no
complications and was discharged on ASA, plavix, and BB. TTE
post-procedure showed EF 20% with generalized hypokinesis of LV.
ACE and statin not started due to low BPs and elevated LFTs,
respectively.

On arrival to the floor, patient is comfortable in NAD.  She
states that her breathing is much improved since last night.

STUDIES:
([**10-16**]) Echo - The left atrium is Normal in size. The left
ventricular is dilated with severe systolic dysfunction. The
basal inferolateral wall contracts. The remainder is near
akinetic. The aortic valve leaflets are severely
thickened/deformed. Severe [4+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is at least mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
The estimated pulmonary artery pressure is UNDERestimated in the
setting of severe tricuspid regurgitation. There is no
pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Left ventricular cavity dilation with extensive
systolic dysfunction c/w multivessel CAD Severe regional wall
motion abnormalities as noted with c/w multivessel CAD or other
diffuse process. At least mild pulmonary artery hypertension. No
pericardial effusion.
.
([**10-16**]) CXR -  Increased bilateral pleural effusions which are
moderate to large in extent with worsening bibasilar airspace
opacification, which could reflect compressive atelectasis
though infection or aspiration is not excluded.  Mild pulmonary
edema.
.
([**10-18**]) CXR - Since the prior study, there is substantial
improvement in pulmonary edema.  Bilateral pleural effusions,
large, right more than left, appear unchanged.  There is no
pleural effusion.  There is no pneumothorax.  Heart size cannot
be assessed precisely giving the obscuration of the heart
borders by pleural
effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
[**Age over 90 **]F with CAD with recent admission for in-stent rethrombosis to
LMCA s/p DES, systolic CHF with EF 20% here with orthopnea and
respiratory distress concerning for acute exacerbation of heart
failure.  During her prior hospitalization she was not
discharged on diuretics due to low blood pressures.  However, on
presentation her BP was 140/77 and subsequently decreased to
100/77 after lasix.  In addition, she is tachycardic to the
120s, thus a pulmonary embolism must also be considered.
.
# HEART FAILURE EXACERBATION (acute on chronic sCHF EF 20%):  Pt
was significantly volume overloaded on admission with elevated
JVP, bilateral LE edema, crackles on exam and CXR with pulmonary
edema and pleural effusions.  In addition, she had an elevated
Lactate concerning for ischemia. Pt was discharged without an rx
for Lasix due to her low SBPs on last discharge. On the floors
the patient was diuresed with a daily goal of negative 1-1.5L.
We used IV Lasix for the first two days, and she responded very
well. On discharge pt was on RA, ambulating on her own, no
orthopnea, no PND, and LE edema significantly reduced. Other
home meds were continued as well (Metop 25BID, ASA 81/day). ACEI
was held due to active diuresis and SBPs were in low 100s.
Follow up Echo and CXR were done, no internval change on Echo
from prior admission, CXR on discharge was significantly
improved.
.
# IN-STENT RETHROMBOSIS:  During last week's admission is s/p
in-stent DES to LMCA; EKG changes consistent with evolving MI at
that time. We continued the regimen from prior discharge: ASA
81, Plavix 75, BB, and enzymes were trended. No new s/s of
ischemia during this admission.
.
# RHYTHM:  Pt was in Sinus rhythm during course. We continued
metoprolol 25mg [**Hospital1 **]
.
