Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
amiodarone

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1515**]
Chief Complaint:
elective corevalve

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Percutaneous aortic valve replacement
Endotracheal intubation
Central line


History of Present Illness:
86 year old woman with severe AS (valve area = 0.4, peak
gradient 100), LVEF 55%, PAF, Amiodarone lung toxicity,
pulmonary fibrosis, pacemaker for tachybrady syndrome,
scleroderma/CREST syndrome and severe pulmonary hypertension.
Patient was ADL independent at home untill her most recent
admission to [**Hospital1 18**] in [**4-/2119**] with small bowel obstruction and
pneumonia compicated by left basilic vein DVT from a PICC line
which was replaced prior to her discharge on [**2119-5-25**].  She was
started on Vanco + Cefepim [**5-21**], she had negative blood cultures
and sputum grew MRSA,  Cefepim was given for 5 days and Vanco
for 10 days (last dose 5/11). Patient was worked up during her
admission for aortic valve procedure to treat her critical AS.
She is now readmited electively from rehab for the procedure.
Antibiotics for pneumonia have been completed and patient is
afebrile. Bowel obstruction has since resolved and patient is
tolerating soft diet. Coumadin was discontinued on [**2119-6-7**] and
switrched to fundaparinaux. She does report frequent loose
stools, repeated assays for C. diff have been negative.
.
Untill her recent admission patient had been ADL independent and
taking care of her demented [**Age over 90 **] year old husband at home. She
dressed, cooked and shopped on her own and got cleaning help
once weekly. She did have base-line DOE and was not able to walk
more than 20 paces without stopping. She has had significant
unintentional weight loss over the past 4-5 years. She was on
oxygen at home for hypoxia attributed to her chronic pulmonary
fibrosis. She has chronically low systolic blood pressure,
running 70-90's. She had intermittent dizziness upon standing.
She had orthopnea X 1 pillow. Nocturia X2. She denies leg
swelling. At rehab she was able to walk upto  10 paces with
walker and had to stop d/t SOB. She reports an episode of
epigastic/lower anterior chest pain yesterday after a meal which
she attributes to her scleroderma related GERD. Pain was
continous for 2 hours and resolved with analgesia. ECG was
checked and was reportedly unchanged. She denies any chronic
angina.
GU: voiding spontaneously, occasional inconteince.
.
Hct on [**6-8**] --27.7 . No evidence of bleeding. Hct initally was
around 33 at rehab, but has trended down to 27-28 and has
remained stable since [**6-1**].
.
On review of systems, she denies prior history of stroke, TIA,
pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, cough,
hemoptysis, black stools or red stools. Denies recent fevers,
chills or rigors.
.
Cardiac review of systems - notable for absence of paroxysmal
nocturnal dyspnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or
presyncope

Past Medical History:
1. Aortic stenosis (valve are = 0.8)
2. Left ventricular systolic dysfunction with ejection fraction
of 45-55%.
3. Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.
4. Amiodarone lung toxicity.
5. Pulmonary fibrosis, on home oxygen. PHTN (PAP = 80)
6. Tachybrady syndrome, status post permanent pacemaker.
7. History of breast cancer.
8. Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
9. Scoliosis.
10. Diverticulosis.
11. Hypothyroidism.
12. Basal cell carcinoma.
13. Left rotator cuff tendinitis and partial tear in [**2119**].
14. Scleroderma with GI manifestations and lung manifestations,
but without renal manifestations.
15. Severe pulmonary hypertension.
16. left basilic vein thrombosis, PICC induced [**5-/2119**]: Left
basilic vein thrombosis: PICC induced during previous admission
[**5-31**], considered superficial thrombosis. PICC on left pulled and
no anticoagulation was indicated
17. s/p left shoulder injury with rotator cuff tear [**2119**]
18. partial SBO [**4-/2119**]



Social History:
Retired, a registered nurse [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 88870**]. Until her previous
admission in [**4-/2119**] patient reports she had been ADL independent
and taking care of her demented [**Age over 90 **] year old husband at home. She
dressed, cooked and shopped on her own and got cleaning help
once weekly. She did have base-line DOE and was not able to walk
more than 20 paces without stopping. She has been in rehab since
her discharge on [**2119-5-25**], There she was able to walk up to 10
paces with walker.
.
Her 4 kids live in the area. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 20246**] (daughter)  is her HCP
(tel: [**Telephone/Fax (1) 88871**]).

[**6-14**] TTE: FOCUSED STUDY. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is normal (LVEF>55%). An aortic CoreValve prosthesis is
present. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. There is no
pericardial effusion.
.
[**6-20**] TTE:
The left atrium is elongated. Left ventricular wall thickness,
cavity size and regional/global systolic function are normal
(LVEF >55%). The right ventricular cavity is markedly dilated
with moderate global free wall hypokinesis. An aortic CoreValve
prosthesis is present. The prosthetic aortic valve leaflets
appear normal The transaortic gradient is normal for this
prosthesis. A mild (1+) anterior paravalvular aortic valve leak
is present. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Moderate [2+]
tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is severe pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Normally-functioniong CoreValve aortic prosthesis
with mild paravalvular regurgitation. Normal global and regional
left ventricular systolic function. Severe pulmonary
hypertension with dilated right ventricle with moderate global
systolic dysfunction. Moderate mitral regurgitation.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2119-6-15**],
estimated PA pressures are higher still and RV appears slightly
more dilated. The other findings are similar.
