follow up was on [**2102-11-21**]. While the patient was
driving he had an acute onset of left visual field blurring
without associated symptoms or prodromal symptoms. The
duration was 5 to 15 minutes. It resolved without any

test in [**2097**] done for preop cholecystectomy. The patient's
stress test showed a fixed inferior wall and apical defect.
The patient denies chest pain, palpitations, PND, or edema.
He does admit to COPD secondary to smoking. He has a history
of hemoptysis with a negative bronchoscopy and new hilar mass

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Laryngeal carcinoma status post
resection and tracheostomy, myeloplastic disorder x multiple
years, was followed by a hematologist. Last bone scan was
negative. This is due to be repeated. GERD, treated with
Protonix, coronary artery disease with a positive stress on
medical management and stable, COPD secondary to tobacco use,
hemoptysis secondary to new hilar mass, elevated intraocular
pressures on the right eye secondary to surgery and injury,
ocular pressures are in the high normal. The patient is not
on eye drops at present. Supramammary spleen. Tremors.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Laparoscopic cholecystectomy in [**2097**]
secondary to cholelithiasis, ventral herniorrhaphy.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is a retired general contractor
and lives with his spouse, son and grandson. [**Name (NI) 1139**] use - 2
to 3 packs per day. He has not smoked for 10 years. He denies
alcohol use.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs are stable, afebrile. He
is an alert white male in no acute distress. Oriented x3.
HEENT examination showed tracheostomy permanent status post
radial neck surgery. No lymphadenopathy. Carotids are 1+
bilaterally without bruits. Lungs show diminished breath
sounds in all lung fields. No wheezing or rhonchi. Heart
shows regular rate and rhythm without murmur, gallop or rub.
Abdominal examination is benign. Peripheral vascular
examination shows feet are warm and pink. Pulse examination
shows palpable carotid pulses bilaterally 1+; radial artery
pulses 2+ bilaterally, femoral pulses are 2+ bilaterally.
Popliteals: DPs are 2+ bilaterally, PTs are 1+ bilaterally.
NEUROLOGIC: The patient is oriented x3. Motor strength is
intact. Deep tendon reflexes are equal bilaterally. Plantars
are downward.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the vascular
service. Routine admitting labs were obtained and neurology
consult was requested. Head CT was done. IV heparin was begun
once lab results and CT results were known. The patient was
continued on his current medications. The patient was
prepared for surgery. His admitting white count was 4.0,
hematocrit 24.9, INR 1.3, BUN 15, creatinine 0.9, EKG was
normal sinus rhythm with right bundle branch block with Qs in
2, 3 and left axis deviation. Chest x-ray showed a right
upper lobe spiculated opacity and changes of COPD.

The patient was evaluated by neurological service. Neurologic
service felt that the patient would benefit from undergoing
open left carotid endarterectomy versus stenting considering
the degree of the stenosis and the area of stenosis. The
patient underwent on [**2102-12-1**], a left carotid
endarterectomy. He tolerated the procedure well and was
transferred to the PACU neurologically intact and
hemodynamically stable. Immediately postoperatively the
patient continued to do well. His postoperative hematocrit
was 26.8. The patient was transferred to the VICU on
postoperative day 1. There were no overnight events. The
patient's diet was advanced as tolerated, ambulation was
begun. Postoperative day 2, the patient had no events
overnight, seeming neurologically stable.

The patient was discharged to home in stable condition and
