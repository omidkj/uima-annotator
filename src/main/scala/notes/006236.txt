[**Doctor Last Name **]/tcc
[**-8/4872**]  Tracheal Tumor.
SPECIMEN SUBMITTED: Biopsy right tonsillar fossa, additional
right tonsil.
DIAGNOSIS:
I.  Right tonsillar fossa, biopsy (A-B):
Invasive squamous cell carcinoma, well to moderately
differentiated, involving squamous mucosa; focal necrosis is
identified.
II.  Right tonsil, additional tissue (C):
Invasive squamous cell carcinoma, well to moderately
differentiated, involving squamous mucosa and adjacent skeletal
muscle.

FDG TUMOR IMAGING (PET-CT)  [**2170-1-17**]

INTERPRETATION: There is focal abnormal uptake of FDG in a right
pharyngeal
mucusal soft tissue mass measuring 2.2 x 2.8 cm, with an SUV max
of 11.8. There is no FDG-avid neck lymphadenopathy.
There is another focus of marked FDG avidity (SUV max 8.9)
within the
mediastinum, in the subcarinal region, approximatey 3.3 x 3.9 cm
(including the carina, which is stented and patent). There are
several additional mediastinal lymph nodes that are not
FDG-avid. There is no FDG avid parenchymal lesion within the
lungs.

There is a moderate right and small left effusion.

There is no abnormal FDG avid lesion within the abdomen and
pelvis.

Note is made of dependent fluid layering in the presacral and
perirectal space along with diffuse and dependent subcutaneous
edema within the lower abdomen and pelvis.

Physiologic uptake is seen in the heart, liver, spleen, GI and
GU tract.

IMPRESSION: 1. Abnormal markedly FDG-avid subcarinal mass
consistent with
pathological diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma. 2. No
additional FDG-avid mediastinal, hilar, or lung lesions. 3.
Worrisome FDG avid right pharyngeal mass concerning for separate
malignancy given patient's history and location. Recommend
direct visualization of this lesion. 4. Dependent subcutaneous
and perirectal/presacral edema. 5. Bilateral pleural effusions.

MR HEAD W & W/O CONTRAST  [**2170-1-19**] 10:24 AM

FINDINGS: There is no evidence of mass, abnormal enhancement,
hemorrhage, or abnormal signal intensity in the brain. The
ventricles are within normal limits. The surrounding osseous and
soft tissue structures are unremarkable with mild mucosal
thickening in the ethmoid sinus and small amount of fluid in the
mastoid air cells. There is no diffusion abnormality. The cystic
lesion in the left mandible is partially included and shows low
signal on T1 without ehhancement.

IMPRESSION: Normal brain MRI. No evidence of metastasis. Mucosal
thickening in ethmoid sinus and within the mastoid air cells.
Left mandibular cystic lesion.

CT NECK W/CONTRAST (EG:PAROTIDS)  [**2170-1-19**] 9:51 AM

NECK CT WITH CONTRAST: Comparison was made with a prior PET CT
dated [**2170-1-17**]. There is asymmetric soft tissue measuring
approximately 2.5 x 2.0 cm in the right hypopharynx at the
tonsillar pillar, corresponding to the FDG- avid mass,
suspicious for neoplasm likely a primary tumor rather than
metastasis. There is no significant mass or asymmetry in the
nasopharynx. There is no significant lymphadenopathy. There is a
2 x 1 cm fluid-containing cystic lesion in the subcutaneous
tissue anterior to the mandible. In the left internal jugular
vein, there is tubular filling defect measuring 4 mm in
diameter, and -30 [**Doctor Last Name **].
In the visualized portion of the lung apices, there are
bilateral pleural effusion and patchy opacities in the lungs.

There are degenerative changes of a cervical spine.

IMPRESSION:
1. Soft tissue mass and asymmetric in the right hypopharynx,
corresponding to FDG-avid tumor, suspicious for primary neoplasm
such as squamous cell carcinoma. Direct visualization and biopsy
is recommended.
2. 2 x 1 cm fluid-containing cystic lesion anterior to the left
mandible. Physical examination is recommended.
3. Hypodense tubular small filling defect in the left internal
jugular vein. The Hounsfield unit is somewhat too low for
thrombus or turbulent flow, however, if clinically indicated,
please perform ultrasound for further evaluation.
4. Bilateral pleural effusion and patchy opacities in the
apices. Mucous secretion in trachea.

CT CHEST W/CONTRAST  [**2170-1-21**] 3:56 PM
FINDINGS: There is a conglomerate nodal mass centered at the
level of the carina, extending superiorly to the level of the
aortic arch and inferiorly to the azygoesophageal recess. This
lesion encases the mainstem bronchi with extension peripherally
to the hilar regions, with possible encasement of the upper and
lower lobe bronchi. Although this mass encases the central
airways, there is no evidence of significant airway narrowing or
endobronchial lesion. Y-stent is seen in the trachea, with a
small focus of extraluminal gas lateral to the trachea at
approximately the level of the aortic arch. This may represent a
localized perforation. No evidence of diffuse mediastinal gas.

Moderate-sized bilateral pleural effusions are seen, with
atelectasis of the adjacent lung parenchyma. This is more severe
on the left compared to the right. Additionally, multifocal
areas of peribronchiolar ground- glass opacities are also
present, which may be infectious, inflammatory, or related to
aspiration. Compared to PET/CT [**2170-1-17**], these ground-
glass opacities are slightly improved. Mild paraseptal and
centrilobular emphysema.

A small pericardial effusion is seen. Otherwise, the heart and
great vessels are unremarkable.

IMPRESSION:
1. Large conglomerate nodal mass with its epicenter at the level
of the carina, encasing the central airways. Given possible
