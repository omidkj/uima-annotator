Findings
LEFT ATRIUM: Elongated LA.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: No ASD by 2D or color Doppler.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thickness. Normal LV cavity size.
Overall normal LVEF (>55%). [Intrinsic LV systolic function
likely depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTA: Normal ascending, transverse and descending thoracic
aorta with no atherosclerotic plaque.

AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (3). Mild
(1+) AR. Eccentric AR jet.

MITRAL VALVE: Moderately thickened mitral valve leaflets. Mild
thickening of mitral valve chordae. Mild valvular MS (MVA
1.5-2.0cm2). Moderate to severe (3+) MR. [**First Name (Titles) **] vena contracta is
>=0.7cm

TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets. Mild [1+] TR.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflets.
Physiologic (normal) PR.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify I was present in compliance with HCFA
regulations. The patient was under general anesthesia throughout
the procedure. No TEE related complications.

REGIONAL LEFT VENTRICULAR WALL MOTION:





     N = Normal, H = Hypokinetic, A = Akinetic, D = Dyskinetic
Conclusions
PREBYPASS
The left atrium is elongated. No atrial septal defect is seen by
2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are
normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). [Intrinsic
left ventricular systolic function is possibly more depressed
given the severity of valvular regurgitation.] Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The ascending,
transverse and descending thoracic aorta are normal in diameter
and free of atherosclerotic plaque.The aortic valve leaflets (3)
are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The aortic regurgitation jet is eccentric. The mitral valve
leaflets are moderately thickened. There is mild valvular mitral
stenosis (area 1.5-2.0cm2). Moderate to severe (3+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The mitral regurgitation vena contracta
is >=0.7cm.

POST BYPASS
Biventricular systolic function is preserved. There is a well
seated, well function, bileaflet mechanical prosthesis in the
mitral position. Valvular MR, which is normal in quantity and
location for this type of prosthesis, is visualized (washing
jets) The study is otherwise unchanged from the prebypass study.

  I certify that I was present for this procedure in compliance
with HCFA regulations.

Brief Hospital Course:
She underwent mechanical mitral replacement on [**4-30**]. Please see
operative report for further details. She weaned from bypass on
Neo Synephrine and Propofol, weaned and extubated easily. All
lines and drains were discontinued in a timely fashion.  Pressor
weaned off and she was transferred to the floor. As per Dr.[**Last Name (STitle) **],
atrial pacing wires were discontinued and the ventricular pacing
wires were cut, without difficulty.

Physical Therapy was consulted to evaluate her  strength and
mobility. On POD 2 her hematocrit was found to be 20(repeated).
A CXR was unremarkable and she was stable. Two units of red
blood cells were given along with Lasix between units.
Anti-coagulation was initiated with coumadin and a heparin
bridge for goal INR 2.5-3.5.  The remainder of her postoperative
course was essentially uncomplicated. On POD 5 she was cleared
for discharge to [**Hospital 2670**] rehab in [**Hospital1 487**] for further
increase in stre
