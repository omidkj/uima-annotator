[**2136-7-16**] CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST - In the right lobe of the
liver, there is a rim enhancing collection measuring 4.0 x 5.6
cm that contains foci of air, concerning for abscess. Increased
ascites compared to the prior exam. Increased intrahepatic
biliary duct and pancreatic duct
dilation, likely secondary to known pancreatic mass.

[**2136-7-17**] CT GUIDED NEEDLE PLACTMENT - Technically successful
CT-guided aspiration drainage of a gallbladder fossa collection.
8 French [**Last Name (un) 2823**] catheter placed. 30 cc of purulent material
were aspirated to bag and gravity. 1 cc was sent for
microbiology specimen. No immediate complications.


Brief Hospital Course:
NEURO/PAIN: The patient was maintained on IV pain medication on
admission and transitioned to PO narcotic medication with
adequate pain control on HOD#X once oral intake was tolerated.
The patient remained neurologically intact and without change
from baseline during their stay. His home dosing of
benzodiazepines was continued without evidence of delirium or
mental status change. The patient remained alert and oriented to
person, location and place.

CARDIOVASCULAR: The patient remained hemodynamically stable. The
patient was maintained on IV anti-hypertensive medication, with
transition to their oral home anti-hypertensives on HOD#[**3-15**].
Their vitals signs were closely monitored. The patient's home
anti-hypertensive medications were resumed on HOD#3.
Unfortunately, the patient developed ventricular tachycardia
prior to ERCP in the setting of hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia.
He required amiodarone boluses and synchronized cardioversion to
revert to sinus rhythm. He was transferred to the ICU for
monitoring. Patient treated with esmolol drip overnight and
remained in sinus rhythm throughout. Esmolol drip stopped and
patient placed back on home metoprolol. He tolerated this well
and cardiology agreed with this management. He was transfered
out of the ICU and did well on oral metoprolol up to discharge
without any hemodynamic instability.

RESPIRATORY: The patient had no episodes of desaturation or
pulmonary concerns. The patient denied cough or respiratory
symptoms. Pulse oximetry was monitored closely and the patient
maintained adequate oxygenation.

GASTROINTESTINAL: The patient was NPO on admission and on HOD#2
experienced significant abdominal distention and episodic emesis
requiring nasogastric tube placement. The NGT was discontinued
on HOD#3 and was replaced on HOD#6 when complained of increasing
abdominal discomfort and epigastric bloating. The second NGT
placement resulted in 2.5L of bilious return. He was eventually
showing improvement, the NGT was removed and clear liquids were
tolerated. He did receive 2-days of supplemental TPN, but this
was discontinued and the patient was again allowed to maintain a
regular diet, as tolerated.

The patient underwent a CT of the abdomen and pelvis on
admission that showed a right lobe of the liver rim enhancing
collection measuring 4.0 x 5.6 cm that contained foci of air,
concerning for abscess. There was increased ascites compared to
the prior exam and increased intrahepatic biliary duct and
pancreatic duct
dilation, likely secondary to known pancreatic mass. He
underwent CT-guided aspiration and drainage of a gallbladder
fossa collection on HOD#2 with placement of an 8-French [**Last Name (un) 2823**]
catheter, and 30 cc of purulent material were aspirated to bag
and gravity. 1-cc was sent for microbiology specimen. The
culture returned mixed bacterial flora and he was started on
Vancomycin and Zosyn IV on admission. He was continued on these
antibiotics until PO intake was established, at which time the
patient was transitioned to oral Augmentin. IV antibiotics were
resumed when his ICU transfer was instated, and a 10-day course
was completed. The drainage catheter was removed prior to
discharge.

Patient underwent ERCP with placement of mental biliary stent.
The duodenal was not obstructed as previously thought and no
stents were placed. Oncology and palliative consults were
obtained. He was discharged with heme/oncology and palliative
care follow-up regarding possible chemotherapy and hospice
services.

GENITOURINARY: The patient's urine output was closely monitored
in the immediate post-operative period. A Foley catheter was
placed on admission to monitor urine output and was removed on
HOD#2, at which time the patient was able to successfully void
without issue. The patient's intake and output was closely
monitored for urine output > 30 mL per hour output. The
patient's creatinine was stable.

HEME: The patient's hematocrit was stable and trended closely.
He did have a single episode of bloody bowel movement which
resolved without issue; and serial hematocrits were stable. The
patient remained hemodynamically stable and did not require
transfusion. The patient's coagulation profile remained normal.
The patient had no evidence of bleeding.

ID: The patient was admitted with a WBC of 26.0 which trended
down following drainage and IV antibiotic treatment. The patient
underwent a CT of the abdomen and pelvis on admission that
showed a right lobe of the liver rim enhancing collection
measuring 4.0 x 5.6 cm that contained foci of air, concerning
for abscess. There was increased ascites compared to the prior
exam and increased intrahepatic biliary duct and pancreatic duct
dilation, likely secondary to known pancreatic mass
