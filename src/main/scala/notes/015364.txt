History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 71745**] is a 41 yo M Spanish-speaking, poor historian,
history of systolic heart failure 16% (per nuc stress test, but
35% per ECHO) s/p AICD placement, atrial fibrillation, and PE
diagnosed [**2191-12-25**] on lovenox (but sounds inconsistently
compliant with regimen) who presents with onset of chest pain
and vomiting without diarrhea starting at 830 pm. Took 5 nitros
without relief of symptoms. Pt ususally drinks "a gallon" of
liquor a day, but today only drank "a half pint" per patient per
translator, and otherwise has not been having much po intake. On
interview in MICU, he states his last drink was on Wednesday at
830pm. He denies dyspnea, abdominal pain, leg swelling. States
he is compliant with all his meds. Denies any illicits.

In the ED, initial VS were: 97.6 108 144/83 16 100%. While in
ED, patient vomiting and complaining of chest pain and to a
lesser extent abdominal pain. Tender across all of rib cage and
abdomen. Pt intermittently tachycardic to 140s (sinus tach on
EKG), improved briefly with ativan and fluids but then rose
again. Labs notable for EtOH 179, AST/ALT 149/62, HCT 33.7
(baseline 30-33), WBC 3.8. UA bland. BCx sent. CXR unremarkable.
CTA showed no PE. CT [**Last Name (un) 103**]/pelvis unremarkable. He received 2L
IVF, ativan 2mg IV x3, zofran 4mg, and dilaudid 2mg IV. He was
admitted to the ICU for tachycardia/withdrawal. Vitals prior to
transfer: 98 15 140/85 98% on RA.

On arrival to the MICU, vitals are: 97.7 136/100/107 21 97% RA.
Patient appears diaphoretic and fatigued. He endorses chest pain
and nausea.

Past Medical History:
-EtOH abuse (1 pint - 1 liter/d)

Brief Hospital Course:
41 yo M with h/o dilated systolic CHF (EF 35%), PE, EtOH abuse,
AFib presenting with nausea, chest pain and tachycardia.
.
# TACHYCARDIA: unclear etiology, looks like atach vs. atrial
flutter with 2:1 block on EKG. Pt has known h/o AFib. Most
likely secondary to volume depletion in setting of poor PO
intake. Also may be [**1-26**] EtOH withdrawal; EtOH positive on serum
tox but states last drink was two days ago and has h/o
withdrawal. Could also be opioid withdrawal. Has been ruled out
for PE via CTA.
**ICU Course**
Initially beta blocked, but no response, went into flutter, was
treated with IV verapamil x2 with good transient response.  He
was seen by cardiology who recommended PO verapamil and agreed
to cardioversion.  The patient was successfully cardioverted to
sinus rhythm on [**6-9**]. And remained in regular rate for 24 hours
after conversion.
.
# CHEST PAIN, EKG CHANGES: Pt c/o right-sided chest pain and
nausea, appears diaphoretic. CEs negative x2. EKG shows lateral
TWI, deeper than prior EKGs. Last stress test with no ischemic
changes. Likely demand ischemia in setting of tachycardia, but
should complete ROMI. Also of note, has chronic chest pain over
site of ICD pocket.
**ICU Course***
Complete ROMI with 3rd set CEs, seen by cardiology, changes were
likely demand, improvement but residual twi laterally seen on
previous, resumed previous cardiac meds including aspirin.
.
# EtOH ABUSE: Pt endorses h/o EtOH withdrawal. Last drink was
Wednesday night (one day ago). He is mildly tremulous and
diaphoretic, could be withdrawing although positive serum EtOH
and would be fairly early to start withdrawing.
**ICU Course***
Patient was placed on a CIWA scale with IV ativan, he required
minimal benzos and was found to be tolerating his care with
agitation or aggression, his blood pressures were stable and his
tachycardia resolved with calclium channel blockers and
cardioversion.
.
# CHRONIC SYSTOLIC CHF: EF 35%, has ICD. Unclear etiology, pt
reports h/o MI but no documentation in any records (cardiology
has looked extensively).
**The patient was continued on his home medications, his heart
failure was likely a precipitate to his afib, which was
resolved.  He was never fluid overloaded.  He did not require
aggressive diuresis.
# ELEVATED LFTs: Likely secondary to EtOH abuse and vomiting.
Has good liver synthetic function.
**ICU Care**
The patient was kept on an ativan CIWA scale as he did have
elevated liver enzymes c/w drinking.  These were trended and
were decreasing throughout the stay.  CT abdomen was
unremarkable from a liver perspective.
.
# H/O PE: no PE on CTA
**ICU Course**
Patient was not compliant with his lovenox therapy, he was
cardioverted as he would likely not be compliant with coumadin
and this would provide the dual benefit of rate control and
alleviating the need for him to take daily anticoagulation.
.
#Nausea/Vomiting
**ICU Course**
Patient with a history of gastric ulcers, ha
