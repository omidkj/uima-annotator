Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2569**]
Chief Complaint:
Intraventricular Hemorrhage

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**3-26**]: Stereotactic Drainage of Intraventricular blood, placement
of External ventricular drainage.


History of Present Illness:
The pt is a 76 year-old woman (handedness unknown) who was
transferred from an OSH for an ICH. This history is obtained
from her transfer records. She reportedly presented to [**Hospital 8**]
hospital with right sided weakness, slurred speech and
confusion. Her family had reportedly last seen her 2 days prior.
Per report she had also had an episode of emesis prior to
presentation.

At the OSH she was given 10 unit of Vit K and 1gm of dilantin.
She was then intubated for airway protection with lidocaine
100mg IV, vecuronium 1mg, Etomidate 20mg IV, succinylcholine
120mg and a total of 6mg of Ativan.  Her BP was 145/79 and her
FS was 124. A head CT was done which showed a large L ICH in the
temporal lobe w/ ventricular extension and mild mass effect on
the L midbrain. She was transferred here for further care.

ROS unavailable.

Imaging:
Head CT [**3-25**]:
NON-CONTRAST HEAD CT: There has been no significant interval
change with
persistent left lateral ventricle hemorrhage which appears to be
maximal in
the region of the temporal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] causing dilation of the temporal
[**Doctor Last Name 534**]. There is mass effect on the surrounding white matter
causing sulcal effacement and vasogenic edema. A concomitant
intraparenchymal component in the region of the temporal lobe is
questioned. The hemorrhage also extends from the third ventricle
into the fourth ventricle, overall unchanged since prior study.
There are no obvious masses. There are no new hemorrhagic foci.
There are no major vascular territorial infarcts. The [**Doctor Last Name 352**] and
white matter differentiation in remainder of the unaffected
regions of the brain is normal. There are no other short- term
interval changes. Previously noted minimal 3-mm subfalcine
herniation is unchanged.
IMPRESSION:
1. No short-term interval changes with persistent large
intraventricular
hemorrhage predominantly involving the left lateral ventricle.
2. No underlying masses were discernible, however MRI with
gadolinium may have added sensitivity towards detection of
masses.

MRI/MRA Head [**3-26**]:
TECHNIQUE: T1 sagittal, axial and FLAIR T2 susceptibility and
diffusion axial images of the brain were acquired. Following
gadolinium T1 axial and MP-RAGE sagittal images were obtained.
3D time-of-flight MRA of the circle of [**Location (un) 431**] acquired.
Correlation was made with the head CT obtained earlier on
[**2107-3-25**].
FINDINGS: As seen on the head CT there is an acute hemorrhage
identified in
the left basal ganglia region extending to the left lateral
ventricle. The
hemorrhage has central component of mixed signal intensities
with hyperintense T2 signal indicating fluid and combination of
fluid and blood clot. There is surrounding edema identified.
Following gadolinium minimal marginal enhancement is seen at the
anterior portion of the hematoma. Subtle enhancement also is
seen posterosuperiorly. The degree of enhancement is more in
favor of enhancement at the margin of hematoma from loss of
bloodbrain barrier than an underlying neoplasm. Additional foci
of susceptibility indicating microhemorrhages are seen in the
right periventricular region, right basal ganglia and right
temporal lobe as well as in the inferior vermis region. These
findings favor suggestion of amyloid angiopathy as an underlying
cause for hemorrhage. There is mass effect on the left side of
the mid brain with impending uncal herniation. There is no
hydrocephalus seen. Mild midline shift to the right is
visualized without subfalcine herniation. Diffuse
hyperintensities in the white matter indicate small vessel
disease.
IMPRESSION:
1. Acute left basal ganglia temporal lobe hematoma with
surrounding edema and extension to the left lateral ventricle.
Mild marginal enhancement at the hematoma could result from loss
of blood brain barrier around hematoma than underlying neoplasm.
However, followup examination would help for further
confirmation. The hematoma has mixed characteristics as
described above.
2. Several foci of susceptibility in the right cerebral
hemisphere and
posterior fossa suggest amyloid angiopathy is an underlying
abnormality.
3. Diffuse hyperintensities due to small vessel disease.
4. Impending uncal herniation.
MRA OF THE HEAD:
The head MRA demonstrates normal flow signal for the arteries of
anterior and posterior circulation. Slightly bulbous tip of the
basilar artery is noted, an incidental finding. Slightly bulbous
origin of the right posterior communicating artery is also seen
due to an infundibulum.
IMPRESSION: No significant abnormalities on MRA of the head.

Head CT [**3-26**]:
FINDINGS: Left frontal burr hole and ventricular drain
terminating in the
third ventricle are new since 5 hours prior. Extensive
left-sided
intraventricular hemorrhage involving the left lateral ventricle
and mild
periventicular vasogenic edema causing 3-mm rightward midline
shift is
unchanged since five hours prior. There is no evidence of
herniation and the basilar cisterns are patent. There is no new
hemorrhage identified. Minimal amount of hemorrhage in the right
occipital [**Doctor Last Name 534**] is unchanged since five hours prior. The
paranasal sinuses demonstrate diffuse mild thickening which is
unchanged from five hours prior.
IMPRESSION: New left frontal burrhole with drain terminating in
the third
ventricle. Otherwise, no change since 5 hours prior.
