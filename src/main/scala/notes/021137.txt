Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2071**]
Chief Complaint:
Hemoptysis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
65M h/o multiple myeloma, amyloid, s/p autologous stem cell
transplant [**2149**], on HD for renal failure [**2-10**] myeloma, recently
admitted for w/u of hemoptysis presenting with recurrent
hemoptysis. Patient was admitted from [**Date range (1) 56895**]/11 for evaluation
of hemoptysis. He underwent bronchoscopy and was found to have
diffuse alveolar hemorrhage. Etiology was unclear- ddx included
cytotoxic and non cytotoxic drugs, infection, or connective
tissue disorder. Ultimately was discharged home to complete a
course of levofloxacin and follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] (primary
oncologist), with DAH attributed to being give heparin (for
presumed PE in ED) in setting of hemoptysis.
.
Patient was doing well, though by [**2-20**] had already started to
experience slightly labored breathing. Continued to carry out
daily activities with minimal residual cough (dried blood) until
Monday when symptoms acutely worsened with acute onset SOB with
associated chest tightness. Coughed up frank blood for the first
time since discharge and given increased respiratory distress
came to ED for further evaluation.
.
In the ED, initial vital signs were 97.8 91 171/70 24 89% on RA.
Patient was visibly tachypnic and hypoxic. He was sat-ing 93% on
non-rebreather. Suctioning revealed blood. Given his respiratory
distress, patient opted for intubation; was intubated with
rocuronium and etomidate. Was then given propofol and fentanyl.
Also received labetalol 10 mg for hypertension 213/102 with
heart rates in the 120s. EKG showed new left bundle branch
block.
.
On the floor, the patient is intubated, and somewhat distressed,
coughing up bright red blood via his endotracheal tube.

Pertinent Results:
TT Echo: [**2-24**]
The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or
color Doppler. The right atrial pressure is indeterminate. There
is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular cavity is mildly dilated. There is mild to moderate
global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 40 %). [Intrinsic
left ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed
given the severity of valvular regurgitation.] Tissue Doppler
imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure
(PCWP>18mmHg). There is no ventricular septal defect. Right
ventricular chamber size is normal. with borderline normal free
wall function. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Mild (1+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Severe (4+)
central, mitral regurgitation is seen. No apparent chordal
rupture or partial flail leaflet is seen. The tricuspid valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is moderate pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is a very small pericardial
effusion. There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.

TE Echo [**2-25**]:
Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). There are
simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion and no aortic stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is
seen. There is borderline/mild posterior leaflet mitral valve
prolapse. Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no evidence of mitral valve leaflet flair due to
tendinae or papillary muscle rupture. The anteromedial and
posterolateral papillary muscle are hypocontractile. There is no
pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: moderate-to-severe mitral regurgitation secondary to
isolated papillary muscle dysfunction; no flail seen
.
TT Echo [**3-3**]:
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular cavity is mildly dilated. Regional left ventricular
wall motion is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size
and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (?#)
appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion. No
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
structurally normal. Mild to moderate ([**1-10**]+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is a very small pericardial
effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2151-2-24**],
the severity of mitral regurgitation and the estimated pulmonary
artery systolic pressure are now lower.

Brief Hospital Course:
65 year-old male with multiple myeloma s/p autologous stem cell
transplant ([**2149**]) and amyloidosis, ESRD on HD with recent
admission for DAH of unknown etiology admitted to MICU [**2151-2-23**]
with hemoptysis.

In the MICU ([**Date range (1) 80980**]), patient was intubated for airway
protection (extubated [**2151-2-27**]).  Bronchoscopy revealed diffuse
hemorrhage without purulence.  He required 2 units pRBC for
hematocrit decrease from 31 to 23.5.  Etiology of hemoptysis was
suspected to be new severe mitral regurgitation (not seen on TTE
just 10 days prior); autoimmune workup from prior admission was
within normal limits.  Nicardipine drip was initiated for blood
pressure control/afterload reduction; he was subsequently
transitioned back to home blood pressure regimen.  Patient
underwent evaluation by cardiology and cardiac surgery.  RHC/LHC
revealed normal wedge pressure, absence of occlusive coronary
disease (50% OM, otherwise normal), and increased cardiac
output.  For evaluation of hypokinetic LV papillary muscle
(without rupture) with surrounding normal myocardium, he was
initially planned for cardiac MRI to assess for amyloidosis -
given risk of NSF on ESRD, this was not done.  Case was
discussed with BMT service; repeat protein electrophresis
revealed persistent monoclonal gammopathy.  He was transferred
to cardiology service on [**2151-3-3**] for further management with a
plan for afterload reduction to reduce degree of MR and thereby
negate the need for urgent surgery.
