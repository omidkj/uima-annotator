leukocytosis to 26, nausea, emesis and ischemic right leg.  Pt
was seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1391**]
[**2187-7-6**] for discussion regarding failed bypass and need for
amputation. He was sent home and felt well until this am when he
was hypoglycemic to the 60s and nauseous.  He vomited foodstuff

sputum production, no dysuria, patient states he has been making
the usual amount of urine.  No pain over kidney [**Hospital3 **] nor over
vascular [**Hospital3 **] site.  Patient denies pain at RLE, but states
that
the mottling of RLE is worse. Sensation in RLE is intact and
there is no weakness. He was also noted to have minimal drainage
from the medial portion of his wound, stable for a few days, no
foul smell. Temperature on arrival to OSH 102.6 HR 110 with Bp

                            **FINAL REPORT [**2187-7-11**]**

   Blood Culture, Routine (Final [**2187-7-11**]):
      STAPH AUREUS COAG +.
         Consultations with ID are recommended for all blood
cultures
         positive for Staphylococcus aureus and [**Female First Name (un) 564**] species.

         FINAL SENSITIVITIES.
         This isolate is presumed to be resistant to clindamycin
based on
         the detection of inducible resistance .
         Oxacillin RESISTANT Staphylococci MUST be reported as
also
         RESISTANT to other penicillins, cephalosporins,
carbacephems,
         carbapenems, and beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations.

         Rifampin should not be used alone for therapy.

                              SENSITIVITIES: MIC expressed in
