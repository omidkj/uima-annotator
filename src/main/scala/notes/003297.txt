History of Present Illness:
65 y/o F with h/o CABG and DM2 presented with fever, malaise,
cough since Monday and severe weakness today. Per husband she
has had chronic DOE with inability to walk for long periods of
time without resting. She has been seen by a cardiologist for
this but not a pulmonologist. On Monday she started having a
cough productive of green sputum without blood. She also had
shaking chills and fevers. Yesterday she started having diffuse
muscle aches and profound weakness as well as diarrhea. Today
she attempted to get out of bed and fell and could not get up so
her husband called 911.
 She was brought to the ER at NWH where she told them she also
had not urinated since thursday morning ([**2109-5-23**]). At NWH she
appeared mottled and lips were blue. O2 Sat was 93% on 2L NC.
Because she appeared blue she was placed on NRB. Also originally
SBP 140sand reportedly was borderline hypotensive her lowest
systolic pressure being 105, which responded to fluids (2L NS).
She was also incontinent of stool and had numerous foul smelling
loose BMs. A CXR showed "right paratracheal soft tissue density"
and a repeat CXR showed persistent right soft tissue density and
 right apical consolidation. Since she had a markedly elevated
white cell count 20 so she was treated with
CTX/Vanc/Flagyl/Azithro. Labs also revealed acute renal failure,
lactate of 6.6 and a markedly elevated AST. There were no unit
beds there and so she was thransfered here.
.
In the ED, initial vs were: T:100.6 HR:106 BP:96/74 RR:22
O2Sat:88RA. Spiked temp to 102.8, RR was 40. Placed on NRB and
sats up to 100%. On exam guaiac pos brown stool from below. ED
got history that patient had been taking two tabs apap 2Xdaily
for the last week and thought she may have APAP OD so started
NAC per recs from ED physician who is [**Name Initial (PRE) **] tox attending. APAP
level was negative. Received 2.5L in the ED and then noted to be
tachypneic and rhonchorus so was placed on CPAP.
VS prior to transfer to floor: Hr 113 RR 35 Sat 98 BP 128/74
(stable in ED)
 .
On the floor, patient was initially tachypneic to 40 with tidal
volumes of 110 on Bipap 10/5. She appeared uncomfortable but was
able to talk to us. She denied chest pain but endorsed severe
muscle aches, worse in her legs that had started yesterday. She
also endorsed severe muscle weakness causing her to crawl on the
floor to get to the bathroom and making it hard for her to get
out of bed. She denied urinary symptoms. Endorsed diarrhea X 1
day. Also endorsed cough productive of green sputum X 1 week. no
hemoptysis.
.

CXR ([**5-24**]):
1. Thickening of the right paratracheal stripe, can represent
mass or vascular structures. This can be further evaluated by
CT.
2. No evidence of pneumonia or overt pulmonary edema.
.
CXR ([**5-24**]):
1. Widening of the upper right mediastinal contour, incompletely

characterized, and requiring a dedicated chest CT for more
complete assessment when the patient's condition allows.
2. Fluctuating right upper lobe opacity is possibly due to
aspiration or
atelectasis.
3. Small right effusion.
.
CXR ([**5-25**]):
Previously described abnormality in right mediastinal contour is

unchanged and could potentially represent lymphadenopathy.
Slight worsening of opacities in right upper lobe concerning for
pneumonia. New interstitial opacities likely reflect
interstitial edema. Unchanged small right effusion.
.
CXR ([**5-29**]):
Multifocal pneumonia has worsened and mild pulmonary edema has
developed since [**5-27**]. Moderate cardiomegaly increased. Pleural
effusions are small, if any. The previous right upper
paratracheal fullness is no longer evident. I wonder if this
patient has had a gastric pull-up or has an otherwise normal
esophagus to account for the change over such a short interval.
Alternatively, a mediastinal abscess could have drained
internally.
.
TTE ([**2109-5-25**]):
Suboptimal image quality.The left atrium is mildly dilated. No
atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left
ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular
cavity size is normal. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a
focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded (although
inferior and infero-lateral severe hypokinesis is suggested).
Overall left ventricular systolic function is probably mildly
depressed (LVEF= 40-45 %). The right ventricular cavity is
mildly dilated with depressed free wall contractility. The
diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are
normal. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened.
There is mild aortic valve stenosis (valve area 1.2-1.9cm2). No
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Mitral regurgitation is present but cannot be
quantified. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Tricuspid regurgitation is present but cannot be quantified. The
pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
There is no pericardial effusion.
