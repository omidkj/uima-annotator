Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7055**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest Pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Pericardial Effusion Tap


History of Present Illness:
54 y.o woman with history of htn, hyperlipidemia transferred
here from [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) **] after presenting there with chest pain and
shorness of breath and was found to have a pericardial effusion.
Last Saturday, the patient began to have chest pain and
presented to [**Hospital3 **], where she was ruled out for an MI with
cardiac enzymes x2. She was given toradol at that time with good
effect for her chest pain.
.
She represented to her PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on Tuesday when she started
feeling generally unwell with increasing shortness of breath,
weakness, chills and subjective feelings of cold. She was sent
to [**Location (un) 620**] where a CT scan demonstrated bilateral pulmonary
infiltrates and a pericardial effusion. She got echoes on [**11-20**]
and [**11-21**], which demonstrated worsening pericardial effusion and
early signs of tamponade with RA diastolic collapse. She was
then transferred to [**Hospital1 **] for further care.
.
On review of systems - No nausea, vomiting or diarrhea. No sick
contacts. Positive for non productive cough. She does also
report having night sweats frequently over the last several
years, worsening over the last 2 weeks. Denies recent weight
loss.

Pericardial Fluid: NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.

ECHO [**11-22**]: Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF>55%). with normal free wall contractility. There is a
moderate sized pericardial effusion. There is sustained right
atrial collapse, consistent with low filling pressures or early
tamponade. IMPRESSION: Moderate circumferential pericardial
effusion with evidence of impaired ventricular filling/early
tamponade. Findings were discussed with the ordering team by the
cardiology fellow at the time of the study.

ECHO repeat [**11-22**]: Overall left ventricular systolic function is
normal (LVEF>55%). There is normal right ventricular free wall
contractility. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial
effusion. IMPRESSION: No clinically-significant pericardial
effusion.Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of
[**2171-11-22**], there is less pericardial fluid now.

Cath Lab Report [**2171-11-22**]: 1. Successful pericardiocentesis via
subxiphoid approach with removal of approximately 220cc of
bloody fluid.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Pericardial effusion with early tamponade.
2. Successful pericardiocentesis with removal of approx. 220 cc
of
bloody fluid.

CXR [**11-22**]:There are extensive parenchymal consolidations
bilaterally in the perihilar and lower lobe distributions that
potentially might represent pulmonary edema. On the other hand
multifocal pneumonia is a consideration. There is left
retrocardiac consolidation that might represent combination of
atelectasis with the parenchymal widespread process. ARDS would
be another possibility to consider. The left and right pleural
effusion are present, left slightly greater than right. There is
no pneumothorax. The contours of the cardiac silhouette on the
left are obscured by the consolidation, thus the change in
cardiac size after pericardiocentesis cannot be estimated.

ECHO [**2171-11-26**]:There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF=
50-55 %). [Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is
likely more depressed given the severity of valvular
regurgitation.] Right ventricular chamber size is normal. with
borderline normal free wall function. There is abnormal systolic
septal motion/position consistent with right ventricular
pressure overload. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good
leaflet excursion. There is no aortic valve stenosis. Trace
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is
probably moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There
is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. Compared with the
prior study (images reviewed) of [**2171-11-22**], left ventricular
systolic function is slightly less vigorous and heart rate is
lower. There is no significant change in pericardial effusion.

CXR [**11-26**]: IMPRESSION: Improvement of changes most likely
related to CHF component.  some basal infiltrates and pleural
effusions remaining. Further followup is recommended.


Brief Hospital Course:
54 y.o woman with pericardial effusion s/p pericardiocentesis
and multifocal pneumonia, pleural effusions of unknown etiology.
.
#Pericardial effusion - On admission, patient noted to have
pulsus paradoxus with chest pain and SOB. She went for
pericardiocentesis with drain placement. On arrival to the CCU,
she had 270cc sanguinous exudate in the drain and accumulated an
additional 30cc. The pericardial drain was placed to gravity and
then pulled once output decreased substantially. Repeat ECHO
shows no effusion. Chemistry on the fluid is consistent with
exudate, cultures show no growth. Etiology of effusion is
unclear at this time and includes inflammatory, malignant and
infectious. [**Doctor First Name **] was normal/weakly positive at 1:40, ANCA
negative, HIV and HepC Ab negative, HbSAg and HbSAb were
negative. TSH wnl. The cytology of 60ML of pericardial  fluid
was negative for malign
