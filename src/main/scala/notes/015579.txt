History of Present Illness:
39-year-old woman with h/o type I diabetes since age 14 months,
glomerulonephritis, kidney transplants in [**2174**] and [**2177**], and a
double kidney and pancreas transplant on [**2188-11-20**], who has newly

diagnosed EBV-driven CNS lymphoma.  She was discharged on
[**2199-8-30**] following an identical course of MTX and leucovorin-
this admission required both HD and CVVH to manage toxicity in
the setting of her renal transplant.  Since discharge, the
patient had a negative ROS and no issues.


Past Medical History:
PAST ONCOLOGIC HISTORY:
======================
Her neurological problems began in [**2199-3-22**] when her mother
noted psychomotor slowing, short-term memory problems, inability
to tolerate stress, and tremors in the hands.  By [**2199-4-22**], she
had additional symptoms including word-finding difficulty and
slurred speech.  Her mother took her to [**Hospital3 3583**], and she
was released.  Her mother then took her to see a neurologist at
[**Hospital3 417**] Hospital, and he put her on Zoloft for possible
depression.  She was admitted to the [**Hospital1 827**] on [**2199-5-28**] for admitted [**2199-5-28**] for elective
ventral hernia repair with mesh.  She also had a workup for her
mental status status change.  A head MRI without gadolinium
performed on [**2199-5-31**]  showed moderate atrophy and mild
periventricular hyperintensities.  There was a question of mild
communicating hydrocephalus.  A spinal tap performed on [**2199-6-3**]
showed 2 WBC, 49 protein, and 72 glucose, but she was positive
for EBV PCR in the CSF.  But HHV-6, HSV1 and 2, and [**Male First Name (un) 2326**] virus PCR
were all negative.  She was placed on 15 days of IV ganciclovir
for meningoencephalitis with positive EBV PCR in CSF.  A repeat
lumbar puncture on [**2199-6-21**] yield negative EBV PCR, both
qualitative and quantitative, in the CSF.  But her memory
function improved but it was still off.  A repeat head MRI
without gadolinium showed 3 hyperintense FLAIR lesions in the
left caudate, right parietal periventricular region, and left
frontal region near the surface of the brain.  She underwent a
stereotaxic brain biopsy by [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], M.D. on [**2199-8-1**] and
the pathology showed EBV-driven CNS lymphoma.  Her cyclosporin
was taken off subsequently.  I saw her for the first time in the
[**Hospital **] clinic on [**2199-8-13**], and her lumbar puncture that
day showed 6 WBC, 61 protein, 56 glucose, atypical lymphocytes
on cytology and negative flow cytometry.  She also had an
FDG-PET of the entire body on [**2199-8-14**]. It showed focal
increased uptake in known right parietal (SUVmax 5.0) and left
basal ganglia lesions (SUVmax 6.8), and there was no FDG avid
disease outside the brain.  She has just finished cycle 1 of MTX
with leucovorin rescue.
.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
====================
She had a history of diabetes, and it resolved after her double
kidney and pancreas transplant on [**2188-11-20**].  She has
hypertension and hypercholesterolemia, but no COPD.  She was
diagnosed with EBV encephalitis in [**2199-5-22**] and treated with
gancyclovir.  She had her first kidney transplant in [**2174**], and
then a second kidney transplant in [**2177**], followed by a double
kidney and pancreas transplant on [**2188-11-20**].

cigarettes, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs


Family History:

Reports:
[**2199-9-14**] CXR: There is new development of bilateral vascular
engorgement, upper zone redistribution of vasculature,
interstitial extensive opacities and bilateral perihilar
alveolar opacities continuing toward the lung bases, findings
that are representing interstitial-alveolar pulmonary edema, at
least moderate in severity.
[**2199-9-15**] CXR:  In comparison with study of [**9-14**], there has been
a substantial decrease in the pulmonary vascular congestion.
Bibasilar opacification persists, consistent with pleural
effusion and compressive atelectasis.

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 39 year old female with ESRD s/p panc/kidney
transplant, recently
diagnosed with CNS lymphoma. Pt was admitted for methotrexate
therapy and hemodialysis.
.
# EBV-Drived CNS Lymphoma:  Patient tolerated IV high-dose
methotrexate well; she was started on hemodialysis 6 hours later
and simultaneously started on leucovorin rescue. She was
dialyzed again on [**2199-9-12**]. She continued to get IV fluids to
help clear MTX until [**2199-9-14**] when she developed flash pulmonary
edema. She was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], but was quickly
stabilized and transferred back. She was given Lasix 40mg IV BID
and her oxygen requirement which was initially 4L.  On transfer
she was transitioned to po lasix and weaned off oxygen with
improvement in CXR.
.
# Fever: The patient spiked to 101.5 on the same day as [**Hospital Unit Name 153**]
transfer. She was empirically started on Meropenum and
Vancomycin. Upon transfer to the floors, patient remained
afebrile.  Infectious work up was negative and so antibiotics
were discontinued.
.
# Kidney Transplant:  She was followed by the renal transplant
team while in the hospital.  She tolerated Hemodialysis well.
The patient was maintained on prednisone.  Mycophenolate was
initially held and restarted at a reduced dose.
.
# Pancreas Transplant:  Stable.  Patient continued on prednisone
and mycophenolate was restarted later during patient's
hospitalization.
.
# Hypertension: In the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] her atenolol was switched to
carvedilol and her amlodopine was continued.
