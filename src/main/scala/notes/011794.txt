Brief Hospital Course:
She underwent a simultaneous pancreas-kidney transplant with
duodenal loop mid ileostomy by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] assisted by Dr.
[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 816**] on [**2140-6-25**]. Please see operative report for details.
She was sent to the SICU postoperatively given concern for
elevated intra-abdominal pressure. On [**2140-6-25**] she was taken back
to the OR for  abnormal pancreatic duplex ( Absence of flow
within the splenic vein and loss of diastolic flow on Doppler
waveforms consistent with splenic venous obstruction to the
pancreatic transplant)and underwent exploratory lap, transplant
pancreatectomy and 4 compartment fasciotomies of bilateral lower
extremities. The etiology of the compartment syndrome was
unknown. She also suffered a right iliac thrombosis requiring
thrombectomy. An IVC filter was placed on [**2141-6-27**]. Insulin was
resumed. [**Last Name (un) **] followed making recommendations. On [**2140-6-27**] she
returned to the OR for fasciotomy of the right forearm, wrist
and hand, mediannerve decompression right wrist; fasciotomy left
forearm,wrist and hand, median nerve decompression left wrist.
This procedure was done by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 30291**] from plastics.
     Postop course was complicated by delayed graft function
requiring CVVHD because she wasn't able to handle hemodialysis.
She was given milrinone. She experienced rapid afib and required
cardioversion and amiodarone. Hemodialysis was eventually
started for several weeks.  Nephrology followed closely
throughout this complicated hospital course. A renal biopsy was
done on [**7-21**] given concern for rejection. This was consistent
with cellular/acute rejection.  There was concern for a humoral
rejection given findings of  +/- vascular staining for C3.
There was no significant staining for IgG, IgA, IgM, Kappa, or
Lambda.  Albumin and fibrin were non-contributory.  The C4d
stain was negative with focal staining in less than 10% of the
peritubular capillaries. She was initially given OKT3 with
solumedrol. This was stopped when she experienced pulmonary
edema which required intubation. Solumedrol was given for 5 days
and prednisone continued at 20mg qd. Urine output gradually
increased. Creatinine started to trend down. Hemodialysis was
stopped. Creatinine decreased to a low of 1.4. She continued on
cellcept 1 gram [**Hospital1 **], prednisone 20mg qd, and prograf 7mg [**Hospital1 **].
Prograf levels were slow to increase. She reached a level on [**8-15**]
at 13.6. Goal prograf level was [**9-21**].
     Early in the postop course she experienced a LUL pneumonia
which responded to IV vanco and zosyn. Sputum was positive for
E.coli and pseudomonas. Subsequent CXRs were improved. A cardiac
echo was done given significant fluid retention. Prominent
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with left and  right
ventricular cavity sizes and low normal left ventricular
systolic function was noted. A TSH was checked given significant
fluid retention. This was 13 and felt to be secondary to sick
thyroid. T3 & T4 were wnl.
     She underwent closure of the lower extremities and
debridement of the abdominal wound on [**7-15**] (please see operative
report). A abdominal wound vac was placed and changed q 72
hours. The transplant ureter was transected during this
procedure and repaired. JP drain was in place. Fluid from the JP
was sent for creatinine and revealed values similar and less
than the serum creatinine ruling out a urinary leak. The foley
was removed and she experienced urinary freqeuency attributed to
bladder deconditioning secondary to being anuric prior to
transplant. Urinalysis and cultures were negative for infection.
On [**7-29**] she grew out klebsiella from the abdomenal wound
sensitive to meropenum. She received six days of meropenum.
     Neurology and orthopedics as well as PT evaluated her for
bilateral plantar flexion deformities and ankle contractures
from prolonged immobility. Neurology expressed concern for
possible nerve injury due to compartment syndrome. Orthopedics
recommended afo's,splinits, arom and prom activities. Neurology
agreed with Ortho's plan though suggested boots should be 4hrs
on and 4 hours off. Adjustable multipodis boots were obtained,
but were not used at this time due to the calf incisions and
potential for injury to incisions. PT/OT worked with her
extensively. Rehab was recommended. Nutrition followed her due
to poor po intake. A tube feeding was utilized for post pyloric
feedings. This was removed eventually when her appetite
gradually improved.
     She experienced significant pain in her extremities and
abdomen that was managed with methadone, dilaudid pca, po
dilaudid. Methadone was stopped per patient request. PCA
dilaudid was stopped and intermittent dilaudid IV prior to
dressing changes was utilized for break thru pain med. She was
able to get out of bed with max assist to the chair. Psychiatry
and social support provided support as she was quite depressed
from prolonged and complicated course. Antidepressants were
deferred. Mood improved with physical improvement.
     IV heparin was utilized until coumadin was therapeutic. INR
goal of 2.3 was achieved on [**8-15**] on 5mg. INRs should be check
daily until she remains stable in the 2-3 range. Coumadin was
decreased to 2mg qd on [**8-16**] for INR of 3.4.
     The plan was to discharge to [**Hospital3 **] with
follow up Monday [**8-22**] at 0800am with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 816**].
