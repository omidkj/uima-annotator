craniotomy

History of Present Illness:
This is an 89 year old male with a history of dementia,
hypertension, ESRD on hemodialysis and recent admission for
fevers and failure to thrive who presents from dialysis with a
syncopal episode. Per notes he received 2.5 hours of his
dialysis session but during the last 15 minutes he was noted to
slump in his chair and to lose consciousness for 2-3 minutes.
There was no overt seizure activity noted. No tongue biting or
loss of bowel or bladder function. No head trauma. Per EMS on
arrival he was arrousable but not at his baseline. He was
immediately transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]. As per recent discharge
summary his baseline is "confused" and has been deteriorating
rapidly over the past several months with episodes of delerium
and generalized failure to thrive.
.
In the ED, initial vs were: T: 98.3 P: 90 BP: 150/62 R: 14 O2
sat 95% on NRB, FS 98. He had a CXR which was unchanged from
prior films. EKG showed normal sinus rhythm, left axis
deviation, normal intervals, no acute ST segment changes, no
change from prior dated [**2190-10-3**]. He had a head CT which shows a
large new left sided fluid collection with mass effect. Exam in
the emergency room was notable for inability to follow commands
and withdrawal to painful stimuli. He was seen by neurosurgery
who felt that he would be a candidate for burr hole placement if
this were within the patient's goals of care. He is admitted to
the MICU for further management.
.
On the floor he is unable to respond to questions. He screams
out with painful stimuli to extremities. He is able to follow
commands to smile and close his eyes tightly. Otherwise further
history is unable to be obtained.

R waves are more prominent.

[**11-13**] CT head
IMPRESSION: Lentiform left frontoparietal fluid collection
measuring 2.6 cm,
new with mass effect. Attenuation values suggest mostly CSF
densoty with some
hemorrhagic elements. This may represent a subdural hygroma
mostly containing
CSF secondary to hypotension.

[**11-14**] EEG
 Markedly abnormal portable EEG due to the very frequent and
occasionally rhythmic and persistent sharp waves with following
slowing,
primarily in the left posterior temporal region or left
hemisphere but
occasionally with a generalized distribution, and due to the
slow and
disorganized background. The background abnormalities signifies
an
encephalopathy. The focal sharp waves indicate an area of
cortical
hypersynchrony in the left hemisphere, likely more posteriorly.
They
suggest a focal lesion in that area. The repetitive discharges
suggest
brief electrographic seizures, but there was no definite
clinical
effect. The discharges certainly indicate potential for longer
seizures
at other times.

[**11-15**] CT head

1. Stable large predominantly chronic subdural fluid collection
overlying the
left frontoparietal convexity reaching that vertex; the overall
appearance is
suggestive of a chronic process, either "liquefied" subdural
hematoma or true
hygroma, with fibrovascular strand formation.

2. While the significant degree of mass effect on the subjacent
brain is
unchanged, there is further subfalcine herniation, with 12 mm
rightward shift
of the normally-midline structures; this measured 8 mm on the
admission study.

3. No new cerebral edema or hemorrhage.

[**11-16**] CT head


1. Status post left subdural evacuation with post surgery
changes.

2. Persistent left subdural fluid collection with mass effect,
with mild
decrease in size and attenuation when compared to prior study.

[**11-16**] CXR
Slight improvement of the left lower lobe atelectasis with
stable
small left pleural effusion, otherwise unchanged.


Brief Hospital Course:
89yoM with a history of dementia, hypertension, ESRD on
hemodialysis and recent admission for fevers and failure to
thrive who presents from dialysis with a syncopal episode found
to have a new left sided fluid collection on head CT.

Had focal seizures activity on EEG and per Neuro started on
Dilantin.

Pt was taken to OR for evacuation of fluid collection with
Neurosurgery. MAC was used and pt was not intubated. On day
after procedure, pt noted to be unresponsive, tachypneic and
very stridourous. Bronched, but no obvious abnormality seen.
Discussion with family and pt was made CMO. Pt deceased [**2190-11-16**]
at 2035.
