History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 4636**] is a 71 yo wheel-chair bound woman with
paraplegia, hypertension, and question of COPD who was admitted
on [**9-11**] with altered mental status.   Per the patient, she had
been experiencing constipation for 5-6 days prior to admission.
She did have a small BM on the morning of admission. On the day
of admission, the patient reported feeling sweaty and dizzy, and
dropped a cup of tea onto her lap.  Her neighbor who was
visiting noticed she was weak and dysarthric, and called
lifeline who then brought the patient to the ED.
.
In the ED, her initial vitals were temp 99.5, bp 113/44, HR 96,
RR 16, SaO2 96% on NRB.  Her bp decreased to 81/38 in the ED and
she became unable to respond to commands, so she was given 4 L
NS.  Her bp slightly improved to 91/45.  She also had a large
loose BM in ED.  A right IJ was placed.  UA was nitrite positive
with moderate bacteria.  CXR was concerning for left lower lobe
pneumonia.  The patient was thought to have sepsis [**1-6**] to PNA
vs. UTI, and she was given Vancomycin 1 mg IV x1, Levaquin 750
mg IV x1, and Tylenol PR 1 gm x1 and transferred to the MICU.
.
In the MICU the patient was started on Levophed for pressure
support.  WBC 19.6 with a left shift, Lactate 3.4 -> 2.2.  She
was initially drowsy and lethargic.  She then complained of
being constipated, despite having repeated episodes of loose
stool since arrival to the MICU.  She complained of low back
pain & LLQ. No CP/SOB or cough. Other ROS negative.  The
patient's family reports that she often develops similar MS
changes when she has an infection.
.
Currently, the patient reports a 2 day history of servere
([**9-12**]) constant burning lower midline abdominal pain that
radiates down to her rectum.  She says this is similar pain to
what she experienced when she was admitted [**12-11**].  No back pain
though she is unsure if she would sense back pain. She also
notes severe diarrhea and loose stools since admission.  She
reports a cough occasionally productive of light brown mucous.
Denies HA, fevers/chills.

IMAGING:
CXR Portable ([**9-11**]): IMPRESSION: Findings concerning for left
lower lobe pneumonia.
.
CXR Portable ([**9-11**]): FINDINGS: There has been interval placement
of a right IJ intravenous catheter with its tip projecting over
the expected location of the lower SVC. The upper vascular
redistribution as well as interstitial edema is more prominent
in the supine view. Again seen is an area of increased opacity
projecting over the left mid lung. Th
