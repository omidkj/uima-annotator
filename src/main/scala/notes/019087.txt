[**2138-9-16**] Cardiac Catheterization
1.  Selective coronary angiography in this right dominant
patient revealed severe three vessel CAD.  The LMCA was
diffusely
disease with a 30-40% lesion.  The LAD was severely disesed with
a
diffuse proximal segment of 80% stenosis and a segment just
distal to D2
with a 95% lesion. The D1 and D2 were small diffusely diseased
vessels.
The LCX had diffuse disease and a proximal 50% lesion.  The OM1
was
small with proximal diffuse disease. The RCA had extreme
proximal
tortuoisity and diffuse distal 80-90% stenosis.  The PDA was
also
diffusely diseased.
2.  On hemodynamics the LVEDP was minimally elevated at 15mm HG.
There
was mild systemic systolic hypertension

CXR:
[**2138-9-17**] - Normal chest. No abnormalities
[**2138-9-22**] - Interval improvement of pneumoperitoneum. Stable
bilateral pleural effusions. No pneumothorax.

[**2138-9-20**] Abdomen X-Ray:
Nonspecific nonobstructive bowel gas pattern.

[**2138-9-17**] EKG
Sinus rhythm, 83. Compared to the previous tracing of [**2138-9-16**] no
major change.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 7594**] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2138-9-16**] for a cardiac
catheterization. This revealed a 95% stenosed left anterior
descending artery, a 50% stenosed circumflex artery, a 90%
stenosed right coronary artery and a 30-40% stenosed left main
coronary artery. Due to the severity of his disease, the cardiac
surgical service was consulted for surgical revascularization.
Mr. [**Known lastname 7594**] was worked-up in the usual preoperative manner and
found to be suitable for surgery. On [**2138-9-17**], Mr. [**Known lastname 7594**] was
taken to the operating room where he underwent coronary artery
bypass grafting to four vessels. Postoperatively he was taken to
the cardiac surgical intensive care unit for monitoring. On
postoperative day one, Mr. [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 5058**] neurologically intact and
was extubated. He was then transferred to the cardiac surgical
step down unit for further recovery. He was gently diuresed
towards his preoperative weight. Beta blockade and aspirin were
resumed. The physical therapy service was consulted for
assistance with his postoperative strength and mobility. His
drains and pacing wires were removed per protocol. A small
amount of free air was noted on the post chest tube removal
x-ray and an abdominal film was recommended. This revealed a
moderate amount of intraperitoneal free air, mild dilatation of
the transverse colon with scattered air-fluid levels in the left
upper quadrant and linear areas of opacity in the retrocardiac
region, which may represent atelectasis versus consolidation. a
repeat abdominal x-ray the next day showed a nonspecific
nonobstructive bowel gas pattern and no definite evidence of
free air. Mr. [**Known lastname 7594**] continued to make steady progress and was
discharged home on postoperative day six. He will follow-up with
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], his cardiologist and his primary care physician as
an outpatient.
