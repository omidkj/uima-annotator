Service:  [**Hospital Ward Name 332**] MICU

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 58 year old male with
chronic lymphocytic leukemia, status post allo bone marrow
transplant in [**2146-4-5**] with a very complicated course.  The
patient has had line bacteremia times two in [**Month (only) 205**] and now
presents with six to eight weeks' of intermittent progressive
rash.  The patient was seen in clinic the last several weeks.
The rash was believed to be initially a drug reaction to
Vancomycin and Bactrim.  However, the rash continued to get
worse.  The patient was started on steroids with the belief
that the rash was due to graft versus host disease. In the
days prior to admission, the patient is spiking fevers up to
103 and also complains of watery diarrhea.  He also has cough
productive of yellow sputum.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Chronic lymphocytic leukemia diagnosed in [**2135**], status
post allo bone marrow transplant in [**2146-4-5**].
2.  Diabetes mellitus, steroid induced.
3.  Asthma.
4.  Gout.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1   Prednisone 30 mg p.o. once daily.
2.  CellCept [**Pager number **] mg p.o. once daily.
3.  Pentamidine.
4.  IgG q.monthly.
5.  Atarax.
6.  Magnesium.
7.  Folate.
8.  Prilosec.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs revealed a temperature of
99.7, heart rate 110, blood pressure 108/60, respiratory rate
24, oxygen saturation 94% on four liters.  General - Alert,
ill appearing, in no acute distress.  The pupils are equal,
round, and reactive to light and accommodation.  Extraocular
movements are intact.  Dry mucous membranes.  Positive oral
thrush.  The neck is supple with no lymphadenopathy.
Cardiovascular is tachycardic, hyperdynamic, no murmurs.  The
lungs revealed wet crackles bilaterally.  The abdomen is
soft, nontender, nondistended, normoactive bowel sounds.
Extremities revealed 1+ pitting edema.  Skin is diffusely
erythematous and desquamating.

LABORATORY DATA:  On admission, white blood cell count was
2.0, hematocrit 33.0, platelet count 49,000.  Unremarkable
Chem7.  Liver function tests are remarked for alkaline
phosphatase of 770 and LDH 421.

HOSPITAL COURSE:   The patient was initially admitted to the
regular medical floor with fevers and watery diarrhea.  He
received fluids with no significant improvement.  He also had
some broad spectrum antibiotics including Cefepime,
Vancomycin, Levofloxacin and Flagyl.  On the medical floor,
the patient continued to have worsening hypoxia which was not
improving despite numerous medical interventions.  He was
then transferred to the Intensive Care Unit after he
developed hemoptysis and hypoxia with oxygen saturation
unable to improve on noninvasive ventilation.  Initial gases
revealed acidosis with mild hypercapnia and good oxygenation.

In the Intensive Care Unit, the patient was placed on non-
invasive mask ventilation with the hope that this would improve
his pulmonary status. His presumptive diagnosis was diffuse
overall hemorrhage based on the fact that he is a post bone
marrow transplant patient and on his hemoptysis.  The patient had
previously very clearly stated that he is DNR/DNI and did not
wish any intubation.  He did not improve after four days of non-
invasive mask ventilation with at times worsening hypoxia and
hypercapnia. He was maintained on all antibiotics and no clear
source of infection was identified.  On [**2146-9-28**], the patient
developed an episode of hypotension that was not responding to
fluids. He became hypoxic and required increased FIO2 to 100.
Despite repeated fluid boluses, he went profoundly
hypotensive and his mental status was declining.  After
discussion with the family, the decision was made to make the
patient comfort measures only.  The patient was started on
Fentanyl drip and expired at 11:05 on [**2146-9-28**].
