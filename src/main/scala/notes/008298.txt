STUDIES:
[**1-28**] ECG: Sinus bradycardia. Borderline P-R interval
prolongation. Right axis deviation. Modestly prolonged QTc
interval. Possible anteroseptal myocardial infarction of
indeterminate age. Compared to the previous tracing of [**2195-1-1**]
there is no significant diagnostic change.
.
[**1-29**] CXR: 1) Trace right-sided pleural effusion. 2)
Discontinuity of the
cortex of the right humerus is concerning for right humeral
fracture. Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified of the results at 13:03 on [**2195-1-29**].
.
[**1-30**] Right humerus film: Evidence for a slight change in
alignment of 2fracture fragments.
.
[**1-31**] Upper extremity U/S: 1. No evidence of right upper
extremity DVT.
2. Subcutaneous edema noted of the mid right upper extremity.
.
[**2-2**] Renal U/S: No hydronephrosis, stone or mass. The bladder is
unremarkable.
.
[**2-3**] TTE: Marked right ventricular dilation with moderate global
hypokinesis. Evidence of right ventricular pressure overload.
Preserved left ventricular systolic function. Moderate tricuspid
regurgitation. At least moderate pulmonary hypertension which is
likely underestimated.
.
[**2-3**] CTA Chest: 1. No pulmonary embolism or acute aortic
pathology. Incidental finding of a bovine aortic arch variant.
2. Small right pleural effusion with right basilar atelectasis.
Nonspecific left basilar patchy opacities, could represent
atelectasis, but infection cannot be excluded.
3. Bilateral enlarged axillary lymph nodes. Could be reactive,
but given the size and multiplicity, recommend follow-up after
resolution of the current hypotensive episode. 4. Small ascites.

.
[**2-3**] Head CT: No acute intracranial hemorrhage.
.
[**2-6**] TTE: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
normal global and regional systolic function. Dilated right
ventricle with mild global systolic dysfunction. Moderate
diastolic LV dysfunction. Moderate pulmonary hypert
