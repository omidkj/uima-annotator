History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 48 year old man with a history of atrial
fibrillation (not on anti-coagulation), hypertension, right
basal ganglia bleed in [**1-4**] now presenting as a transfer from
an OSH for unresponsiveness and right-sided weakness.  The
history as per the wife (through translator) is that she woke up
at 6 am and was unable to wake up her husband.  [**Name (NI) **] appeared to
be moving his the right side less as well (no facial droop
appreciated).  His last known well state was at 12 am.  She
activated EMS and he was taken to an OSH. There he was noted to
have eyes open but was not following commands. They performed a
head CT and discovered that he had hypodensities in the left-
MCA distribution with
surrounding parenchymal edema. He was transferred here for
further management including intensive care services.  He
arrived in our ER at about 9:30 am.

Past Medical History:
-atrial fibrillation not on anti-coag
-IDDM
-HTN
-right basal ganglia bleed [**1-4**] that left him with some
residual
left sided weakness

Neck: supple
Lungs: Clear to auscultation
CV: Irregular rate and rhythm
Abdomen:  non-tender, non-distended, bowel sounds present
Ext: warm, no edema

Neurologic Examination:
Patient with minimal response (eye opening to sternal rub);
non-verbal; not following commands; weak corneal reflex; weak
gag reflex; left eye deviation; no dolls eye response; withdraws
to pain on left arm and leg, no response on right; some
spontaneousmovement on left arm; absent reflexes on right; brisk
on left


Pertinent Results:
CT (head)[**2165-1-6**]:
1. Large left MCA infarct with loss of the [**Doctor Last Name 352**]/white matter
differentiation.
2. There is hyperdensity of the left MCA, suggesting acute
thrombosis of this vessel.

NCHCT ([**2165-2-7**] - most recent):  Status post large left MCA stroke
and left craniectomy with interval decreased brain swelling, but
persistent herniation of the left hemisphere through the
craniectomy defect. Small hemorrhages are present within the
infarcted left cerebrum.

CBC:  9.2/42/391
Normal LFTs on [**2165-2-17**]

Usually needs K and Mg replacement.

Brief Hospital Course:
Pt was found to have a large left MCA infarction with swelling
and impending herniation.  After discussion with the family, the
decision was made given the patient's young age of 48 to proceed
with craniectomy to avoid impendeding brain stem herniation. On
[**2165-1-6**] he had left frontal, parietal, temporal, occipital
craniectomy with duraplasty and placement of subgaleal drain.
He was admitted to the neuro-ICU for continued management. He
was transferred to the step-down unit on [**2165-1-24**].

The left MCA stroke was likely due to cardioembolic source (afib
not on coumadin). Pt was initially started mannitol, then taken
to OR for craniectomy. Initially, he was started on dilantin for
seizure ppx.  This was later switched to depakote due to concern
for drug fever.  Head CT remained stable.  Started on aspirin
325.

He should be continued on depakote for seizure prophylaxis as he
will need to go to the OR eventually for skull replacement.
Check VPA level q week.  ** He will need a repeat Noncontrast
head CT in [**4-5**] weeks with scan sent to Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name (STitle) 1132**] for review
to determine when he should have his skull replaced. **  In the
meantime, he has a helmet to wear to protect his brain.

Exam upon discharge:  awake, alert, looks at examiner when she
enters the room, nonverbal, does not follow commands or mimic,
tracks money to the right, will turn his head to the right but
has a left gaze preference.  Left arm/leg is strong.  Right face
droop.  Right pareisis.  Will move arm and leg proximally just a
little to noxious stimuli.

Pt has a hx of Afib. Rate is controlled with diltiazem,
metoprolol.  He will occasionally go into rapid afib with HR
150's but most of the time he is asymptomatic.

HTN was controlled with dilt, betablocker, and captopril.

Respiratory wise, he was initially intubated in the ER for
airway protection.  On [**1-7**], early am noted to have RUL PTX,
chest tube was placed.  PTX resolved.  He developed PNA during
his course with pseudomonas in sputum (pan-[**Last Name (un) 36**]).  He was
treated for PNA.  Trach was placed [**1-11**].  He has been stable
from a respiratory standpoint.

ID:
He was initially started on levoflox for presumed aspiration
pneumonia and cefazolin post craniectomy. On [**1-7**], sputum Cx was
positive for Klebsiella (pan [**Last Name (un) 36**]) and pseudomonas (pan [**Last Name (un) 36**]).
On [**1-10**] he was started empiric vancomycin for empiric coverage
of CSF vs line infection. On [**1-11**], ID was consulted. He was
started on Gent and Zosyn.  Vanco was continued. On [**1-15**],
Flagyl was started for c.diff infection.  Zosyn was changed to
Ceftaz on [**1-15**]. On [**1-28**], Gent and Cef d/c'd. WBC decreasing
and pt remains afebrile. Last set of cultures ([**2087-1-25**]) shows
pansensitive pseudomonas in sputum, blood and urine cx negative.
Finished a 14 day course of Flagyl for positive c.diff on [**1-30**].
 He then became tachycardic, tachypnic, diaphoretic on [**2165-2-13**]
and was sent to the ICU as he met criteria for sepsis.  He was
called out the next day and he was never hemodyamically
unstable.  Found to have a pseudomonas UTI.  He will complete a
10 day course of cipro for the pseudomonas on [**2165-2-22**].

Diabetes:  Pt placed on NPH and RISS for coverage.  Please
adjust NPH and insulin as needed per finger sticks QID.

GI/FEN: Pt had PEG placed.  Continued on PPI and tube feeds.

PPX:  pneumoboots, SC heparin, PPI
