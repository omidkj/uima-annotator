Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 398**]
Chief Complaint:
s/p cardiopulmonary arrest

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Mechanical Ventilation (previously trached)
Central venous Catheter
R SC placed [**5-6**] -> d/c'd and changed to PICC line
left femoral A-Line placed [**5-6**]
Chest tube removal

History of Present Illness:
This is a 76 y/o male with with history of large right MCA and
MCA/PCA watershed infarct in [**2-15**], likely cardioembolic due to
his history of atrial fibrillation; cardiomyopathy with EF 15%;
s/p MRSA pneumonia, now with E.coli pleural effusion; C.diff
infection; and s/p recent trach and PEG on [**4-28**] for inability to
wean vent from recurrent aspirations; found unresponsive at the
[**Hospital1 **] Facility this morning. Patient is interactive but
non-verbal ([**1-13**] trach) at baseline, but it is not clear from
records when he was last seen normal.
.
This morning at rehab, at approximately 7:20 am he was found to
be unresponsive and pulseless, but had a blood pressure of at
least 100/60. He was given CPR for 8 minutes, although the
records document a pulse at one minute, and he received
epinephrine, after which he had Vtach at 192, for which pt was
loaded with amiodarone and started on amiodarone gtt. Per
patient's sister, he has been having increased secretions from
trach +/- bloody secretions, requiring increased suctioning.
This is not documented in NH records.
.
He was then transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, with stable BP in
120's/70's and HR in 70's. Initial VS in ED were Tc 98.4, BP
124/70, HR 80's, RR 18, SaO2 100%/vent. He was continued on
amiodarone and given levofloxacin for abx coverage. He had blood
and urine cx sent, CXR, CT head (negative), and CT torso done.
Upon initial exam, he was noted to flex his limbs to noxious
stimuli, but his eyes were deviated up and to the left, and he
had a "resting tremor" of the left arm, which was described as
intermittent twitches of the arm that were not sustained or
rhythmic. He was then transferred to the MICU for further
management. Just before he was transported his nurse in the ED
noticed more pronounced left arm twitching. The ED resident
evaluated him and then called Neurology for a consult
re:?seizure, while the patient was being taken to the ICU.
.
Upon arrival to the MICU, pt's VS were stable, however he was
noticed to have left arm twitching and blood at the corner of
his mouth. Upon opening his mouth, the tongue was found to be
bitten and macerated, with tongue fasiculations. An oral airway
was placed. Patient was given 4 mg IV ativan total and loaded
with 1 gm dilantin.

CT TorsoW/CONTRAST  [**2141-5-6**]

CT CHEST W/CONTRAST; CT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST

CT CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST: The patient has a tracheostomy tube
with tip that terminates at the thoracic inlet. There are
multiple mediastinal and axillary lymph nodes, none of which are
pathologically enlarged. The aorta is moderately calcified along
with coronary artery calcifications. There is a right-sided
pleural effusion that is small in size and decreased compared to
prior study. Two chest tubes are seen within the effusion. There
is a small amount of associated pneumothorax. There is also
atelectasis of the right lower lobe; the possbility of
superimposed airspace disease cannot be excluded. Both air and
fluid are decreased compared to prior study. There is a tiny
left pleural effusion. Within the lung parenchyma, there is
ground glass opacity diffusely thoughout the left lung,
nonspecific, although the possibility of infection cannot be
excluded. Subcutaneous emphysema is seen along the chest tube
tracts.

CT ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST: Within the liver, there is a focal
hypodense hepatic cyst within the left lobe measuring 19 mm.
Within the caudate lobe of the liver, there is an additional 8 x
14 mm hypodensity also likely representing hepatic cyst. The
gallbladder contains a small amount of fluid. There is a small
amount of perihepatic fluid. There is thickening of the aderenal
glands bilaterally without evidence of focal lesion. The
pancreas, spleen, and kidneys are unremarkable. The small and
large bowel are within normal limits. There is no evidence of
obstruction. There is a small- to- moderate amount of fluid
within the pelvis. Calcifications extend along the course of the
aorta into the iliac and common femoral arteries.

CT PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST: The urinary bladder, prostate, and
rectum are unremarkable. There is a rectal tube in place. There
is a moderate amount of soft tissue edema throughout the entire
torso, most notable within the pelvis and proximal thighs. There
is a lipoma in the distal psoas muscle, incidentally noted.

BONE WINDOWS: There are no suspicious lytic or sclerotic bony
lesions. There is fusion of T10/T11 with an angular kyphosis,
unchanged and either postinfectious, postraumatic, or congenital
in etiology. Multilevel degenerative change of the thoracolumbar
spine are seen.

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2141-5-6**] 12:58 PM
FINDINGS: Again demonstrated is a large low-density area within
the right MCA distribution consistent with a subacute/chronic
infarction which is not significantly changed compared to prior
study from [**2141-3-21**]. There are also linear hyperdense foci
near the vertex of the posterior temporal region likely
representing cortical mineralization secondary to the infarct.
There is no evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage. The
ventricles are simila
