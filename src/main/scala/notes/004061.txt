History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 54-year-old gentleman with a history of
recurrent myeloma w/ hx of autologous stem cell rescue in [**Month (only) **],
[**2166**], who now presents for a matched unrelated cord blood
allogeneic transplant. The patient was originally diagnosed with
multiple myeloma in [**2164-1-4**] when he presented for
evaluation of bilateral pleuritic rib pain. Work up demonstrated
a pathologic rib fracture, HCT of 29, and IgA level of 5540 with
positive monoclonal spike.  The patient  was treated with two
cycles of DVD (Doxil, vincristine, Decadron) in 2/[**2164**]. Status
post 2 cycles of Velcade and Decadron in [**6-/2164**], status post one
month of thalidomide, status post 3 cycles of Cytoxan and status
post 3 cycles of D-Pace (Decadron, Cisplatin, Doxorubicin,
Cytoxan, and Etoposide). Status post another cycle of high-dose
Cytoxan for stem cell mobilization in [**1-/2165**], status post
high-dose melphalan with stem cell rescue in [**2-/2165**], status post
3 vaccinations with the dendritic cell vaccine study on protocol
04-098 in 5/[**2165**]. The patient is status post 3 cycles Revlimid
and Decadron alone (Took 25mg po daily x 21 days of Revlimid
with these cycles). The patient is status post XRT to left
humerus. Pt is s/p 8 cycles of Velcade, Decadron, and Revlimid
(Velcade was held for part of cycle 7 and cycle 8). S/P 2 more
cycles of Revlimid at 25mg po daily and Decadron alone [**11-10**].

The patient has had multiple relapses as discussed above but
stable disease since [**Month (only) 216**].  After discussion with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **],
the decision was made to go forward with a cord blood allogenic
transplant as he does not have an HLA suitable donor from the
unrelated donor pool.  He has been admitted to have a cord blood
transplant with 2-/46 cord matches.

On review of system the patient denies any changes in vision,
headache, URI symptoms, cough, fever, shortness of breath, chest
pain, abdominal pain, constipation, peripheral numbness or
tingling, hematochezia, melena, hematuria, or dysuria.  He does
note some diarrhea the day before yesterday which he attributes
to eating some pork, but this responded to Immodium and has
since resolved over the past day or so.  The patient also
describes some xerosis but denies any other complaints.

Past Medical History:
1) Multiple Myeloma: history as above.
2) DM- insulin requiring, diagnosed in [**2159**]; no end organ
involvement
3) HTN- diagnosed in [**2159**]
4) OSA -diagnosed in [**2162**] and prescribed a CPAP device but does

5) history of hydrocoele ([**2161**])
6) history of Zoster (distant) without PHN.


Social History:
