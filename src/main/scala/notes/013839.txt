Chief Complaint:
difficulty speaking


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
s/p intubation

History of Present Illness:
60yo left-handed woman with PMH significant for TIA (unknown
details), L CEA s/p restenosis (50% in [**2194**]), CAD s/p multiple
MIs, hyperlipidemia, IDDM, tobacco use, CHF, COPD, presents with
difficulty speaking. She went to bed with a mild headache at

She awoke at 7am and was unable to speak. She stumbled over to
her neighbor's house (had some difficulty walking) and EMS was

numbness,
tingling, nausea, vomiting. She was brought to [**Hospital6 37588**], where she had an MRI showing an infarct associated
with
a L MCA clot. She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].

Neurologic examination:
Mental status: Awake and alert, cooperative with exam. Oriented

CT head/CTA head and neck [**2197-7-13**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. Motion limited head CT showing small hypodensities of the
left frontal and temporal lobes which likely represent an acute
infarct seen on the outside MRI.

2. Severe atherosclerotic changes of the aortic arch involving
the origins of the left common carotid artery and left
subclavian artery.

3. Minimal narrowing of the left internal carotid artery bulb by

atherosclerotic disease as well as atherosclerotic disease
involving the
cavernous segments of the ICAs bilaterally.

4. Short-segment stenosis of the M2 segment of a posterior
superior branch
of the left MCA.

Non-contrast head CT [**2197-7-14**]:
IMPRESSION:

Mild increase in ill-defined region of hypoattenuation localized
to the left frontoparietal region which is nonspecific in
nature. Differential diagnosis includes infarction versus
infection versus [**Month/Day/Year 1106**] disease. MRI with gadolinium is
recommended for further evaluation of these findings.

Bilateral old lacunar infarcts versus dilated Virchow-[**Doctor First Name **]
spaces in the
basal ganglia.

Transthoracic ECHO [**2197-7-14**]:
The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. No
atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D,
color Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers. The right
atrial pressure is indeterminate. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is mildly
dilated. There is mild regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction with near akinesis of the inferior wall and
mild-moderate hypokinesis of the remaining segments (LVEF =
30-35 %). No intraventricular thrombus is identified (suboptimal
views). Right ventricular chamber size is normal. with moderate
global free wall hypokinesis. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are
mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. No mitral regurgitation is seen. There is moderate
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
effusion.

IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with cavity dilation and regional systolic
dysfunction c/w CAD (proximal RCA lesion). Pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension.

Transthoracic ECHO [**2197-7-17**]:
The left atrium is normal in size. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is mild
to moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
akinesis of the inferior and inferolateral walls. The remaining
segments contract normally (LVEF = 35 %). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. No aortic stenosis is seen. No
aortic
