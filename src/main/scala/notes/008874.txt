Service:  CARDIOTHOR

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 83-year-old gentlemen
status post Porcine Mitral valve replacement in [**2108**] for
severe mitral regurgitation and status post ASD repair in
[**2110**] presenting with increasing fatigue, dyspnea on exertion,
and two pillow orthopnea.  Denies paroxysmal nocturnal
dyspnea or edema.  No history of transient ischemic attack or
CVA.  Ambulates minimally, but denies claudication.  Referred
to outpatient cardiac catheterization on [**9-1**] which
revealed:
1.  Coronary arteries are normal.
2.  Severe mitral regurgitation.
3.  Severe pulmonary artery hypertension.
4.  Depressed cardiac output with an ejection fraction of
40%.
5.  Decreased left ventricular systolic function from severe
mitral regurgitation.

Patient was referred to CT Surgery for evaluation of redo
mitral valve replacement .

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Mitral regurgitation.
2.  Atrial fibrillation.
3.  Congestive heart failure.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:
1.  ASD repair in [**2110**].
2.  Porcine mitral valve replacement in [**2108**].
3.  Bilateral inguinal herniorrhaphy

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat:  No
bruit.  Lungs:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Cardiovascular:  A regular rhythm, 3/6 systolic murmur at the
apex.  Abdomen:  Soft, nontender, nondistended with no
masses.  Extremities:  Warm, well-perfused without edema or
varicosities.  Neurologically:  Grossly intact.

ADMISSION MEDICATIONS:
1.  Lasix 20 mg po q.d.
2.  Digoxin 0.125 po q.d.
3.  Aldactone 25 mg po q.d.
4.  Coumadin.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted on [**9-1**].  His
Coumadin was held and he was started on heparin as his INR
remained elevated on the day prior to surgery.  Vitamin K was
administered.  On [**9-4**], he underwent an uncomplicated
mitral valve replacement with #30 bile prosthetic.

Postoperatively, he remained intubated and was noted to be in
a junctional rhythm/complete heart block with a ventricular
rate of 60-70 requiring milrinone, Levophed, and
Neo-Synephrine.  He was extubated on postoperative day one
and the milrinone was weaned off.  On the evening of
postoperative day one, his Levophed was discontinued and he
was started on a Neo-Synephrine wean.  He was transfused one
unit of packed red blood cells and started on renal dopamine
for a hematocrit of 28 and decreased urine output.  He
remained in first degree heart block/complete heart block on
postoperative day two requiring dopamine at 2 and
Neo-Synephrine at 0.5.  On postoperative day three, the
Neo-Synephrine and dopamine were discontinued.  His lines
were removed and he was transferred to the floor tolerating
po.

The patient had an uneventful remainder of his hospital
course, tolerating advanced diet, remaining hemodynamically
stable and voiding adequately.  His PT level remained at a
level 2, however, and it was decided to transfer the patient
to rehabilitation on postoperative day five in stable
condition.

DISCHARGE PHYSICAL.

rubs or gallops.
4.  Abdomen:  Soft, nontender, nondistended, no masses.
5.  Extremities:  Warm, well-perfused without
edema/varicosities.
6.  Neurologically:  Grossly intact.

rehabilitation.
