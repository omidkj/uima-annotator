Chief Complaint:
Diarrhea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
left hip fracture repair


History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 88 year old female with a history of HTN,
questionable prior TIA, recently admitted for recurrent C. diff
who is now presenting for her 3rd admission since mid-[**Month (only) 216**] s/p
a mechanical fall resulting in a left femoral neck fracture.
She had been discharged on [**2158-10-12**] on a long PO vancomycin taper
after a re-admission for recurrent C. diff.  She had been
feeling better following discharge, but she continued to have
[**3-26**] loose BM's a day with persistent fatigue. There was some
disagreement between the family and the hospital about a safe
discharge to home and on the day of this admission, she slipped
on a wet towel in the bathroom and landed on her left hip with
resulting severe pain. She was taken to [**Hospital1 **]-[**Location (un) 620**] and
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for surgical repair. She was admitted to
the [**Hospital1 **] team for a planned hemiarthroplasty on [**10-14**].

Her clopidogrel was held in anticipation of surgery and she was
started on Lovenox for prophylaxis.  She required an assortment
of medications to help with her pain, which may have resulted in
nausea that also required medications for relief.  She went for
ORIF with Orthopedics on [**10-14**] and it was uncomplicated, without
mention of any significant blood loss, though she was given 1
unit pRBCs in the PACU.  She returned to the medical floor and
her bowel movement continued without any increase in volume or
frequency.  She was hypotensive to 80s/40-50s most of the day
without tachycardia (received atenolol the night prior), but has
been oliguric.  In total, she has received 4.5L IVF and an
additional unit of pRBCs over last 24 hours without improvement
in urine output or blood pressure.  She continued to mentate
well throughout.  She has been afebrile (and has spiked fevers
in the past for her C. diff). The Orthopedics team recommended
continued transfusion but no urgent imaging.  Of note, she was
on plavix for ?TIA and does have a left facial droop that is
stable.

On arrival to the MICU, she had good peripheral access with 18
and 20g IVs. She continues to mentate well and her blood
pressures remain in the 80s/50s.

Past Medical History:
- Hypertension
- ? TIA

Social History:
Retired nurse.  Lives in [**Hospital3 **] and is independent.
ETOH- 3 glasses of wine or port per week.  Denies smoking or
illicit drug use.


Family History:
Breast cancer in daughter and sister.  Mother had high blood
pressure and TIA. Denies FH of heart disease.

FEMUR (AP & LAT) LEFT Study Date of [**2158-10-13**] 8:07 PM
FINDINGS:

Again demonstrated is a left mid cervical femoral neck fracture
with superior
and lateral displacement of the dominant distal fracture
fragment.  No other
fracture is identified.  There is no dislocation.  A linear 12
mm sclerotic
intramedullary lesion within the distal femoral diaphysis may
reflect a small
enchondroma.  No suspicious lytic or sclerotic osseous
abnormalities are
detected.

IMPRESSION:

Unchanged appearance of a displaced left femoral neck fracture.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2158-10-15**] 10:27 PM
IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to [**10-13**]:

Mediastinal veins are not appreciably dilated.  Heart size is
top normal.
There might be a small residual of edema in the right mid and
lower lung
zones, particularly since there is a new small right pleural
effusion.  Left
lung is clear aside from basal atelectasis which is also
probably present on
the right.  Heart size top normal, unchanged.  No pneumothorax.

Portable TTE (Complete) Done [**2158-10-16**] at 11:47:56 AM      FINAL


The left atrium is elongated. No atrial septal defect is seen by
2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity
size and regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF
>55%). There is no ventricular septal defect. The right
ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with mild global free wall
hypokinesis (most prominent in the mid RV free wall with
relative apical sparing). There is abnormal septal
motion/position consistent with right ventricular
pressure/volume overload. The diameters of aorta at the sinus,
ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial
mitral regurgitation is seen. The left ventricular inflow
pattern suggests impaired relaxation. The tricuspid valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate [[**2-24**]+] tricuspid
regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: RV hypokinesis/dilation - consider pulmonary
embolism.

CTA CHEST W&W/O C&RECONS, NON-CORONARY Study Date of [**2158-10-16**]
12:38 PM
FINDINGS:  There is no evidence of pulmonary embolism to the
subsegmental
level.  There are however bilateral moderate-sized pleural
effusions, right
greater than left with associated compressive atelectasis.  The
lung
parenchyma is clear of any focal opacities concerning for an
infectious
process or worrisome nodules or masses.
