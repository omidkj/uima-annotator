History of Present Illness:
HPI: 77 yo F w/ h/o IDDM, htn, CAD s/p IMI and s/p CABG, PVD,
CHF (EF 20%) s/p biventric pacer, and h/o CRI admitted to
[**Hospital3 7571**]Hospital on [**2197-7-3**] for dry heaves + abd
distension x 1.5 wks. Of note, patient s/p partial transverse
colectomy w/ anastomosis [**2197-4-4**] for LGIB w/ course c/b GNR
sepsis, LE DVT, and candidemia. She was d/c [**2197-4-24**]. At [**Location (un) **],
CT only remarkable for inflammation in the lower aspect of the
panniculus in the midline where there was thought to be a
possible fascial defect. No obstruction was seen. She also
underwent EGD to further elucidate an etiology for her n/v and
this only showed mild gastritis and gastric polyps. It was
recommended she start reglan and patient's n/v was much
improved. On approx hospital day #3, patient became hypotn
following ivf resuscitation (? worsening CHF). Her Cr continued
to worsen post hypotn despite attempts for diuresis w/
dobutamine, natrecor, lasix/diuril, and an increase in her paced
rate from 80->90. In addition, her LFTs increased following her
episode of hypotn. Renal consult felt hypotension/hypovolemia
likely causing ATN. A renal U/S showed no evidence of
hydronephrosis and normal kidney size/echogenicity. She was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for continued care due to concern for
future need for HD.

Brief Hospital Course:
On admission, the patient did not meet criteria for acute HD.
Her creatinine was elevated, she was judged hypovolemic, her K
was elevated without ECG changes, she had an AG metabolic
acidosis and was coagulopathic.  Her mental statis was altered
and she demonstrated asterixis.  Her ARF was felt to be likely
ATN w/contribution from hypovolemia.  She was hydrated and her
creatine trended downward until reaching 1.4 on [**7-8**] when she
transferred from the MICU.  Her hyperkalemia was not associated
with ECG changes and normalized with kayexelate.  Her AG was
felt to be secondary to dehydration as she had no elevation in
lactate and the gap closed with hydration.  Her mental status
improved dramatically with resolution of her uremia.  She does
continue to perseverate about her husband and becomes especially
agitated at night; this has been managed with reassurance and
seroquel.  After fluid resuscitation, the patient failed to
diurese, so Swan data were obtained which demonstrated high R
and L sided filling pressures, low CO and high SVR; tx
w/dobutamine gtt and pt began to diurese.  Echo obtained
demonstrated LVEF 55%, moderate to severe (3+) mitral
regurgitation, moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation
and moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.  The
patient's hydralazine was increased to decrease afterload and
after DC of swan to prevent infection, the patient began to
auto-diurese.  This was augmented with lasix and her dobutamine
was titrated downward with increasing UOP until finally DCed
[**7-11**].

Through her course here, she also continued her course of PO
flagyl for C-dif colitis and received a four day course of
fluconazole for candiduria.  Her coagulopathy and small bump in
LFT resolved spontaneously through her course; it is now
believed to have been due to her transient hyoptension on
admission.

The patient is diabetic and her sugars had been difficult to
manage as she began to take PO.  She was discharged from the ICU
on [**7-13**] with creatine of 1.4 and blood sugars controlled on
glargine and ISS.

On the floor, the patient did well.  She was continued on her
metronidazole and previous lantus dose.  The dose of lantus was
not increased because the patient was still not eating full
meals.  She was quite hypoglycemic in the mornings, so her dose
of 50 units Lantus QHS was decreased to 30 units.  She continued
to be hypoglycemic in the AM's, so this dose was further
decreased to 15 units QHS. Her hypoglycemia was likely due to
the fact that she had poor PO intake, and patient was on a
diabetic diet in hospital which she may not have been on at home
while on the 50 units of Lantus.  She was also started on a low
dose beta blocker, metoprolol 12.5 [**Hospital1 **].  This was later
increased to 25 PO TID.  Her hydralazine was stopped.  She was
also restarted on her lasix which was slowly titrated up from
20mg PO QD-->20mg PO BID-->40mg PO BID.  Her lasix should
continue to be titrated up to her original outpatient dose of
80mg po BID.  She was evaluated by PT and OT who recommended
placement in a rehab facility.   The patient was discharged to
rehab in stable condition.
