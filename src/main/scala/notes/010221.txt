History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 11979**] is a [**Age over 90 **] year-old male with past medical history of of
diabetes mellitus and hypertension who was admitted on [**3-24**] with
several days of abdominal and found to have acute cholecystitis
on ultrasound. He underwent a percutaneous cholecystostomy
placement on [**3-24**] and was admitted directly to the SICU from IR.
He was transferred to the floor on [**3-25**] while continuing to
undergo medical management with antibiotics (levofloxacin and
augmentin). Post procedure he became confused and was determined
to be delirious. Geriatrics was consulted and are following.
.
The night of [**3-26**] he developed tachycardia and was noted to be in
atrial flutter with a HR in the 150s. He was given multiple
doses of IV metoprolol and IV diltiazem with control of his
heart rate. During this episode his blood pressure remained
stable. He had been on po metoprolol. He developed tachycardia
again the morning of [**3-27**] (which was treated with 5 mg IV
metoprolol) and po diltiazem was also started. Cardiology was
consulted and recommended increasing his po metoprolol to 12.5
tid and stopping the diltiazem.
.
Currently he is in atrial fibrillation, but rate controlled. He
denies abdominal pain, chest pain, shortness of breath or other
symptoms. He denies having had any symptoms when his heart rate
was fast.
.
Review of systems:
(+) Per HPI
(-) Denies fever, chills, night sweats, recent weight loss or
gain. Denies headache, sinus tenderness, rhinorrhea or
congestion. Denied cough, shortness of breath. Denied chest pain
or tightness, palpitations. Denied nausea, vomiting, diarrhea,
constipation. No recent change in bowel or bladder habits. No
dysuria. Denied arthralgias or myalgias.

Past Medical History:

Social History:
He lives with his daughter. Quit smoking 15 years ago. No
alcohol or drug use.

Family History:

Pertinent Results:
Abd US [**3-24**]:
IMPRESSION: Distended gallbladder, gallbladder wall thickening,
and
pericholecystic fluid are concerning for acute cholecystitis. No
definite
shadowing stone though echogenic GB sludge noted.

MRI abdomen [**3-26**]
IMPRESSION:
1. Limited and incomplete study due to lack of patient
cooperation.
2. Mild intrahepatic duct dilation without definite extrahepatic
biliary duct
dilatation. Evaluation of the mid CBD, as well as the confluence
of the cystic
duct and CBD, however, was limited due to the lack of
visualization of these
regions, and thus, Mirizzi syndrome cannot be completely
excluded.
3. Acute cholecystitis status post percutaneous cholecystostomy
with
decreased distention of the gallbladder lumen. Large amount of
sludge and
debris seen within the gallbladder and cystic duct.
4. Moderate amount of perihepatic ascites.
5. Three hepatic cysts or hemangiomas.
6. Simple cortical renal cysts bilaterally.
7. Small right pleural effusion.

CT abd/pelvis [**4-1**]
1. Post-cholecystostomy tube placement, with two subcapsular
collections.
These may represent most likely liquefactive hematoma versus
biloma,
superinfection cannot be excluded. The collections are stable
compared to MRI
from [**2169-3-26**].
2. Moderate amount of free fluid.
3. Multiple other incidental findings including bilateral renal
cysts,
tortuous, calcified aorta and its branches, and fluid-filled.
4. Anasarca of the soft tissues.

CXR [**3-30**]
IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**3-25**] through 10:
Right lung base elevation has worsened, probably due in large
part to
increasing right pleural effusion. Given the history, this is
concerning for transthoracic spread of infection. Catheter
tubing which previously traversed the right upper quadrant is
external today, as it was on [**3-27**].
Left lower lobe atelectasis is worsened and small left pleural
effusion is
unchanged. Heart size is normal. No pneumothorax. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 714**]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1833**] was
paged.

CXR [**4-4**]
Aeration at the base of the right lung and the middle and lower
lobes has
improved, moderate right pleural effusion persists. Upper lobes
grossly
clear. Heart size top normal. No pneumothorax. A tiny left
pleural effusion is new or newly apparent.

Brief Hospital Course:
Assessment and Plan:
[**Age over 90 **] year-old male with pmh of DM and htn admitted with acute
cholecystitis s/p a percutaneous cholecystostomy whose hospital
course has been complicated by Klebsiella bacteremia, a
parapneumonic effusion new atrial flutter with RVR, delirium,
and a persistent leukocytosis which improved with antibiotics.
.
# Acute cholecystitis: Patient found to have acute cholecystitis
and treated with cholecystostomy tube placement. Bile fluid grew
out Klebsiella and E.Coli and it was complicated by Klebsiella
bacteremia (positive BCx on [**3-24**]) with all surveillance cultures
negative since: Patient was treated initially with broad
spectrum antibiotics (vanc/levofloxacin/zosyn) and then switched
to PO levofloxacin/augmentin on [**4-3**] and remained afebrile on PO
antibiotics. LFTs and bili normalized by discharge. Repeat CT
abd showed possible bilioma which was unchanged in s
