Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 348**]
Chief Complaint:
LUQ pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
61M with history of HTN, HL, unknown to [**Hospital1 22160**] transferred to
our ED from [**Hospital3 **] with LUQ pain. His pain level their
was requiring high levels of narcotics. He also was noted to be
in renal failure with hyperkalemia. He underwent a CT abd
without contrast (due to ARF) there which did not reveal an
acute process. Due to his high pain levels, ARF and enlarged
mediastinum on CXR he was sent here for MRI due to concern for
aortic dissection.
.
In our ED initial VS 97.4 106/67 104 16 97% on 15L NRB. He was
hypoxic to 74% on RA, NRB replaced, sats returned to high 90s.
He had an elevated BUN/Cr, hyperkalemia to 6. Was given
insulin/dextrose/CaGluconate/Kayexelate. No hyperkalemic ECG
changes. ECG was noted to be unremarkable with negative MB and
trop. He had a WBC of 17.8 with a left shift. Negative
LFTs/Lipase. AP CXR in our ED, fairly poor study due to body
habitus, did suggest a LLL. This could also be seen on OSH CT.
Had a bedside u/s of LUQ on ED, noted to be a poor study, no
acute etiology/pericardial effusion visualized. Lactate was WNL.
OSH d-dimer reported as WNL. He received azithromycin,
ceftriaxone for PNA. 2mg of dilaudid for pain control in
addition to aformentioned hyperkalemia tx. He got 3L of IVF.
Refused foley. At time of s/o no UOP. Had 3 18g PIVs prior to
transfer. He was transferred to the MICU service for his hypoxia
as well as being somewhat hypotensive, with systolic BPs in high
80s. He was reported as initially somnolent, thought to be due
to narcotics at OSH (morphine 18mg + Dilaudid 4mg), when pain
controlled was comfortable, when narcotics wore off was SOB,
grunting, tachycardic.
VS at time of transfer were: Afebrile 89/50 96% on NRB 18 HR 97

.
On arrival to MICU pt c/o [**4-3**] pleuritic LUQ pain. Reported
several days of myalgias and mild cough. Denied
fevers/sweats/chills/sputum production/sick
contacts/n/v/diarreha/melena or other complaints.

Echo - The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal
defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is mild symmetric
left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and global
systolic function (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical
quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully
excluded. There is no ventricular septal defect. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good
leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve
appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
There is no pericardial effusion.
.
Outside hospital CT (read by our radiologist) - IMPRESSION: 1.
No acute abdominal/pelvic pathology identified. While
non-contrast evaluation of the aorta is unremarkable, evaluation
for dissection is limited without contrast.
2. Moderately enlarged prostate.
.
[**2185-1-8**] - chest x-ray
IMPRESSION: While atelectasis may represent a componet of the
bibasilar
opacity, pneumonia cannot be excluded; particularly on the left.

.
[**2185-1-10**] Renal U/S
1. No evidence of obstruction, renal mass, or nephrolithiasis.
2. Blood flow demonstrated to the right, equivocal on the left,
although this may be technical in etiology.
.
[**2185-1-10**] LENI
No evidence for deep vein thrombosis in the bilateral common
femoral,
superficial femoral or popliteal veins.



Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 61M with HTN, HL who presents with severe LUQ pain,
acute on chronic renal failure and a possible pneumonia.
.
# Respiratory distress: Transfered from [**Hospital 81171**] hospital hypoxic
with a respiratory acidosis, likly from splinting, underlying
OSA, and narcotics. His pulmonary process may have also
contributed. PNA was suspected given opacities on CXR, high WBC
and several days of malaise despite being afebrile.   Influenza
and legionella negative. His story is also concerning for PE,
but negative LENI, and his conditon improved on antibiotics.
CTA was considered by impossible with renal failure, and VQ scan
not useful with possible pneumonia.  On discharge he is
currently saturating well, not requiring O2 while resting.  Will
continue abx outpatient, sputum and blood cultures pending.
Day #1 post discharge- pts blood cultures 2/4 were positive for
Gram positive rods (cornebacterium and propiobacterium).  Pt was
called and was feeling well. The flora were felt to be most
likely secondary to a skin contaminate and given pts clinical
improvment, no adjustment to his antibiotics was felt necessary.
 He was instructed to make an appointment with his new PCP
[**Name Initial (PRE) 176**] 1 week for follow up.  The PCP office was updated and
sent a discharge summary. Pt was notified to return to the ER if
ongoing fevers, chills, lightheadedness, or worsening of his
symptoms.
.
# LUQ pain. Likely secondary to LLL PNA vs PE. Lipase normal,
pancreas normal on CT non-contrast, guaiac negative so less
concerned for PUD/diverticulitis. CEs negative with no ischemia
on ECG. D-dimer elevated which is concerning for PE but pain and
oxygenation has greatly improved and LENI negative as noted
above.  On discharge pt is without chest pain.
.
#Pulsus parodoxus. Pt admitted to MICU with tachycardia,
hypotension, large pulsus on exam. Admitted physicians
considered pericardial effusion vs hypotension and tachycardia
due to sepsis or PE. TTE was negative for effusion. His pulse
has normalized with improved blood pressure.
.
# Acute on Chronic Renal Failure - atrophic kidneys on CT, has
chronic kidney disease, baseline Cr 2.1, now 2.5 down from 4.4.
Renal ultrasound was normal making post renal obstruction and
renal artery dissection less likely.  Likely cause is pre-renal
from hypotension in setting of PNA. Pt's urine output was
minimal admission and normalized, with excellent output off
foley by discharge.
.
# HTN - on lisinopril/HCTZ at home, which was for now given
renal failure. His pressures improved from original hypotensive
state on admission.  Discharged on home regimen.
 .
# HL ?????? Continued simvastatin 20mg
.
# Anemia- Mild, normocytic
