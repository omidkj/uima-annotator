Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 10593**]
Chief Complaint:
TCA overdose (likely flexeril)

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation
Central Line placement

History of Present Illness:
This is a 45-year-old woman transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] with AMS and
hypotension in the setting of an intentional ingestion.
.
Per report, Ms. [**Known lastname **] was brought in by the police after her
husband called 911 because she was expressing suicidal ideation.
Patient initially triaged at OSH to psychiatry for evaluation,
whereupon she developed altered mental status and hypotension.
Patient was intubated for airway protection with etomidate
followed by succinylcholine and vecurunium.  Initial EKG
revealed widenend QRS and RBBB widened so patient treated for
presumed TCA overdose.  Patient was placed on bicarb 2gm,
Magnesium 2gm, 2L NS and started on dopa drip.  Patient also
received narcan 0.4 and decision made to transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]
for further evaluation.
.
At [**Hospital1 18**], EKG revealed QRS of 150: patient was given 1amp of
bicarb and started on a bicarb drip.  Calcium was given as well.
 SBPs remained in the 70s on max dopamine and decision was made
to start levophed.  Repeat ABG showed a pH 7.51 and bicarb gtt
stopped.  Patient was then given intra-lipid 150ml iv x1 and
25ml/min x60minutes.  Toxicology was consulted and recommended
continuing supportive care.
.
In the ICU, Ms. [**Known lastname **] continued to improve.  Her QRS narrowed
and the bicarb drip was stopped.  She was extubated and called
out to the floor.  Patient told MICU team that she may have
taken old migraine medication, which likely had TCA-like
properties.

Past Medical History:
Depression with previous suicide attempt

.
EKG [**2135-10-18**]: Sinus rhythm at the upper limits of normal rate.
Rightward axis. Consider right bundle-branch block. Borderline
prolonged Q-T interval. No previous tracing available for
comparison. Clinical correlation is suggested.  QRS 154
.
CXR [**2135-10-18**]:
The right internal jugular line is malpositioned with the tip
coursing towards the right axilla, probably within the right
subclavian vein.
However an inadverant position into the arterial system cannot
be ruled out. Consider repositioning the catheter. Bilateral
lung volumes are low. Right lower paracardiac opacity, left
lower lung and retrocardiac opacities are likely from lung
atelectasis.
.
CXR [**2135-10-19**]:
Lines and tubes remain in place in a standard position. There
are persistent low lung volumes. There is no
pneumothorax/pleural effusion. There are persistent bibasilar
opacities likely atelectasis. Perihilar opacity and the left
suprahilar region is also unchanged. Attention in followup in
this area is recommended. This could be due to atelectasis, but
an underlying lung lesion can be present.
.
CXR [**2135-10-20**]:
As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has been
extubated. All other monitoring and support devices have also
been removed.  Arising from the middle portions of the left
hilus is a band-like opacity that is directed towards the left
lung apex. The appearance of this opacity is resembling
atelectasis. At the bases of both the right and the left lungs,
a subtle parenchymal scarring is seen.  Resolution of the
atelectasis should be monitored with chest x-ray. In case of
non-resolution, a CT should be performed.  Normal size of the
cardiac silhouette. No pleural effusions. Status post right
shoulder surgery.
