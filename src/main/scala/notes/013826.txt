Service:  CARDIAC

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 69 year old gentleman
with known cholecystitis who was recently treated for
cholangitis, who was admitted on [**2180-5-12**], with complaint
of upper abdominal discomfort, nausea, and diarrhea, but had
known coronary artery disease.  The patient was admitted with
the intention of having a laparoscopic cholecystectomy.  A
Cardiology consultation was obtained due to the patient's
history of flash pulmonary edema and congestive heart failure
as well as known coronary artery disease and mitral stenosis.
The patient underwent cardiac catheterization as part of his
preoperative work-up.

Cardiac catheterization showed left circumflex lesion of 80%,
subtotal obtuse marginal 1, and a 70% left PDA lesion.  The
patient was also found to have severe mitral stenosis and a
Cardiac Surgery consultation was obtained.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Diabetes mellitus.
2.  Renal insufficiency.
3.  Coronary artery disease.
4.  Mitral stenosis.
5.  Status post myocardial infarction.
6.  History of pulmonary embolism.
7.  History of deep venous thrombosis.
8.  Status post IVC filter.
9.  History of choledocholithiasis.
10. Status post common bile duct stent.
11. Status post knee replacement.
12. History of congestive heart failure.
13. Recent gastrointestinal bleed.
14. Sleep apnea.
15. Benign prostatic hypertrophy.

PREOPERATIVE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Lipitor 40 mg p.o. q. day.
2.  Celexa 20 mg p.o. q. day.
3.  Tramadol 50 mg four times a day p.r.n.
4.  Protonix 40 mg per day.
5.  Clonazepam 0.5 mg q. day.
6.  Lipram two caplets three times a day with meals.
7.  Carafate one gram q. six hours.
8.  Imdur 120 mg q. day.
9.  Levaquin 500 mg q. day.
10. Lopressor 50 mg q. day.
11. Coumadin.
12. Lasix 40 mg three times a day.
13. Humulin insulin, NPH 30 units subcutaneously twice a day.

ALLERGIES:   Penicillin.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  As part of the patient's preoperative
cardiac surgery work-up a dental consultation was obtained to
evaluate the patient's teeth.  The Dental Team as well as the
OMF Team thought that there was a questionable radiolucency
on the Panorex film which they were not able to rule out a
potential problem and recommended continuing antibiotic
prophylaxis until the patient could be evaluated as an
outpatient, however, both the Dental Consultation and the OMF
Team cleared the patient for cardiac surgery.

After the patient's cardiac catheterization it was noted that
the patient had a rising BUN and creatinine.  On [**5-19**], it
was noted that the patient had an elevated creatinine to 3.8
and his surgery was postponed.  By [**5-25**], the patient's
creatinine had decreased back to baseline and on [**2180-5-26**],
the patient was taken to the Operating Room for a mitral
valve replacement with a 29 mm Mosaic porcine valve and a
coronary artery bypass graft times three, with left internal
mammary artery to left anterior descending, saphenous vein
graft to obtuse marginal, saphenous vein graft to OPL.
Please see operative note for further details.

The patient was transferred from the Operating Room to the
Intensive Care Unit in stable condition.  The patient was
weaned and extubated from mechanical ventilation on
postoperative day one which he tolerated well.

On postoperative day number two, the patient's creatinine
again rose to 2.0 from 1.4 immediately postoperatively.
Nephrology consultation was obtained and it was felt that the
patient was pre-renal and recommended avoiding diuresis.  The
patient required multiple units of blood transfusion to keep
his hematocrit greater than 30, which improved the patient's
urine output and renal status.  The patient's creatinine
began decreasing over the next several days.

The patient remained hemodynamically stable during this time.
By postoperative day number four, the patient's creatinine
was down to his preoperative level of 1.5.  The patient was
tolerating anti-hypertensive medications.

On postoperative day number four, the patient was transferred
from the Intensive Care Unit to the Regular Floor.  The
Cardiac Surgery team was not able to obtain peripheral access
on the patient.  The patient's right internal jugular central
line was changed over a wire to a triple lumen catheter which
he tolerated well.  The patient was weak and required maximal
assistance from Physical Therapy.

It was decided that the patient would benefit from a stay at
a [**Hospital 3058**] rehabilitation.  The patient was screened for
rehabilitation and on [**2180-6-1**], was cleared for discharge
to a rehabilitation facility dependent on bed availability.

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:   Temperature maximum 98.0 F.; pulse
83 sinus rhythm; blood pressure 140/90; respiratory rate 20;
room air oxygen saturation 96%.  Neurologically, the patient
is awake, alert and oriented times three.  Heart is regular
rate and rhythm, no rub, no murmur.  Lungs were clear
bilaterally without wheezes or rales.  GI:  Abdomen has
positive bowel sounds; it is obese.  Minimum right upper
quadrant tenderness, positive diarrhea.  Sternal incision is
clean and dry.  Steri-Strips are intact.  Sternum is stable.
Right lower extremity vein harvest site is ecchymotic.
Incision is clean and dry.  The Steri-Strips are intact.  The
patient has significant four plus lower extremity pitting
edema.
