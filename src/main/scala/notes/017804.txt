with mental status changes for past day. He experiences
intermittent discomfort from the hernia. He denies worsening
pain. One week ago, he was admitted for nausea/vomiting and
diarrhea. His symptoms were thought to be due to gastroenteritis

[**2139-6-12**]: cat scan of abdomen and pelvis:

IMPRESSION:

1. Mechanical small-bowel obstruction. Transition point likely
just proximal to right inguinal hernia. There is normal bowel
wall enhancement. In comparison to [**2139-6-6**] exam, bowel loops
within the right inguinal sacappear more prominent with small
amount of free fluid, raising a possibility of closed loop
obstruction. Early bowel ischemia cannot be excluded.

2. Trace bilateral pleural effusions with adjacent areas of
compressive
atelectasis.

3. Numerous hepatic and renal hypodensities, too small to
characterize, may
represent cysts; however underlying malignant disease cannot be
excluded.

[**2139-6-12**]:  EKG:

Sinus rhythm. Left axis deviation. Left anterior fascicular
block.
Non-diagnostic repolarization abnormalities. Compared to the
previous tracing of [**2139-6-5**] there is no significant change.

[**2139-6-12**]: chest x-ray:

  IMPRESSION:

1. Markedly diminished lung volumes. Bibasilar opacities, most
likely
atelectasis, however, superimposed infection cannot be excluded.


2. Stable appearance of prominent mediastinal silhouette, which
is likely due to tortuous aorta with possible aneurysmal
changes.

[**2139-6-12**]: cat scan of the head:


1. No acute intracranial process.

2. Bilateral extra-axial collections likely chronic subdural
hematomas.

3, Small vessel ischemic disease.

3. Prominent sulci and ventricles, likely age-related
involutional changes

[**2139-6-15**]:  Echo:

 The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is moderate symmetric
left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is
unusually small. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. There is no aortic valve stenosis. Mild
(1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Physiologic mitral regurgitation is seen
(within normal limits). The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is
normal. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality due to body habitus.
Moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with a small LV
cavity and hyperdynamic LV systolic function. The RV is not well
seen but is probably normal. Mild aortic regurgitation.
Diastolic function could not be adequately assessed

[**2139-6-15**]:  chest x-ray:


There is no change in the cardiomediastinal silhouette. Lungs
are essentially clear, except for bibasal atelectasis and small
bilateral pleuraleffusions.
Minimal vascular engorgement is noted that might reflect changes
in radiograph technique. No pneumothorax is seen.

[**2139-6-15**]: ultrasound of left arm:

IMPRESSION: No DVT in the left upper extremity veins. However,
nonspecific
asymmetry of the subclavian vein waveforms is noted and a more
central
stenosis cannot be entirely excluded.

[**2139-6-18**]:  ultrasound of left lower extremity:

 IMPRESSION:
No evidence for DVT in the left lower extremity








Brief Hospital Course:
Mr [**Known lastname 84762**] was admitted to the surgical service following repair
of his inguinal hernia on [**2139-6-12**] by Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **]. The
procedure went well without complication. Please see Dr [**Name (NI) 84764**] note for further details. Because of poor oxygenation
and lack of spontaneous deep breaths, he remained intubated
after surgery and was transferred to the ICU intubated/sedated
and off pressors. He was weaned to extubation on POD 1, but
continued to have difficulty with respirations. It became
apparent that he was not mobilizing fluid and had become fluid
overloaded with bibasilar crackles and pitting edema. His IV
fluids were held and he was given IV Lasix. He diuresed well
over the next 24 hours, with measured negative of 1.2 liters. He
was also given regular nebulizers (xopenex and budesonide) given
our suspicion for long-standing undiagnosed COPD. TTE was
performed POD3 revealing normal EF and no significant valvular
disease. He was evaluated by speech and swallow on POD 3 and was
deemed unfit for PO intake. By POD 3, he was saturating well on
2L nasal canula and appeared to have stable mental status, so he
was transferred to the surgical floor, maintaining strict NPO.

Transferred to the surgical floor on POD #3.  He was evaluated
by speech and swallow prior to initiating food because of his
history of overt aspirations.  He was cleared for pureed solides
with supervision during meals. Nutrition services did speak to
the family about adding supplements to the diet.  He dietary
intake has been limited.   His foley catheter was d
