Chief Complaint:
HYPOTENSION / BRADYCARDIA

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None.

History of Present Illness:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 10829**] is an 89 year old woman with HTN, COPD, mild
aortic stenosis, paroxysmal afib (on coumadin), hypothyroidism,
and recent gram negative bacteremia (pseudomonas), presenting
with nausea, vomiting, hypotension and bradycardia one day after
discharge from [**Hospital1 18**] after a complicated stay.
.
Patient has had repeated admission in the recent past, most
recently after presenting with dyspnea on exertion and nausea.
She was found to have positive blood cultures, ([**1-15**]) for
pseudomonas. She was treated with Ceftriaxone and Ciprofloxacin
and discharged to rehab facility.
.
Today, patient was found hypotensive and bradycardic at her
nursing home, with SBP in 80's and HR in the 50's. She was
brought to the ED, where her vitals were T 100/9, HR 68, BP
130/40, RR 18, O2 sat 99% 6L NC. Shortly thereafter, patient
became bradycardic with HR to 30's and BP to 80's. ECG obtained
revealed complete heart block with junctional escape rhythm.
Patient was given atropine x 2, glucagon with little
improvement. Patient continued having nausea and vomiting, and
was obtunded. She was intubated for airway protection and EP was
consulted. Initially plan was to place temporary pacer wire,
while she was bridged with Dopamine, with good improvement in
heart rate, at which time decision not to pursue temp wire was
made. Patient was given calcium gluconate, also with improvement
in heart rate. CT Torso was obtained, which was only remarkable
for a small left pleural effusion and bilateral shoulder
effusions. Patient was transferred to CCU for further
management. Review of systems not obtainable, patient intubated.

CTA Chest/Abdomen/Pelvis [**2121-10-22**]:
1. Fluid collections around both shoulders of unknown etiology.
Recommend
clinical correlation. 2. Interval improvement in bilateral small
pleural effusions. 3. Small right renal hypodensity, too small
to be fully characterized, likely represents a cyst. 4. Small
amount of perihepatic fluid. 5. Endotracheal tube at 3 cm above
the carina. Repositioning is recommended.
.
ECHO [**2121-10-23**]: The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right
atrium is moderately dilated. There is moderate symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Tissue
Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling
pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size and free
wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened. There is mild aortic valve stenosis (area
1.2-1.9cm2). Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The left ventricular inflow pattern
suggests a restrictive filling abnormality, with elevated left
atrial pressure. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.Compared with the prior
study (images reviewed) of [**2121-10-15**], the findings are similar
with less tricuspid regurgitation and lower estimated pulmonary
artery systolic pressure.
.
LENI [**2121-10-24**]: 1. No evidence of DVT in either lower extremity.
2. Right sided [**Hospital Ward Name 4675**] cyst.
.
CTA Head/Neck [**2121-10-24**]: 1. Extensive right hemispheric infarct
involving the anterior and middle cerebral artery distributions.
CT perfusion demonstrates delayed transit time, reduced blood
flow and reduced blood volume in this region. 2. Occlusion of
the intracranial portion of the right internal carotid artery.
.
ART DUP EXT [**2121-10-24**]: Focal right brachial arterial thrombus at
the level of the antecubital fossa. Findings reported to the
referring physician.
.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST [**2121-10-25**]: Edema of the right hemisphere
with mass effect upon the right lateral ventricle and 4 mm
leftward shift of midline structures.


Brief Hospital Course:
Patient presented with hypotension, bradycardia, and
hypothermia. Patient was intubated in ER due to concern of
airway protection secondary to nausea, vomiting and decreased
mental status. Bradycardia thought to be secondary to nodal
medications (Metoprolol Tartrate 50 mg [**Hospital1 **], Verapamil 120 mg
Tablet PO Q24H) in setting of worsening renal function. Patient
was on nodal agents for A Fib and history of tachycardia.
Hypotension and hypothermia on admission were attributed to
sepsis, supported by elevated white count and recent discharge
for pseudomonas bacteremia. Patient was started on Vancomycin
and Zosyn. Cipro was continued. Warfarin was held due to concern
for DIC. Patient was extubated on [**2121-10-23**]. On [**2121-10-24**] patient
entered A Fib and demonstrated decreased L sided movement. On
exam, she had R preferential gaze with L hemiplegia and neglect.
Stroke service was called. CT of head was obtained urgently
showing R ACA/MCA infarct with dense R MCA most likely
cardioembolic secondary to Afib. Given the extensive infarct
with evidence of completion plus the fact that she was already
anticoagulated with INR 2.0 she was not given lytics (IA tPA)
due to high likelihood of hemorrhagic transformation with such
intervention. CT head [**2121-10-25**] demonstrated mid-line shift.
Patient became non-verbal. Fami
