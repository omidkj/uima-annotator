Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Morphine

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 134**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest pain.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None.

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 72974**] is an 86 year-old male with a history of CAD (s/p
CABG in [**2164**]) who presents with chest pain.

Awoke at nursing home at 3am with chest pressure ([**4-22**] and left
sided). No associated nausea, dizziness, SOB. Pain resolved with
nitro and tylenol. Later in the morning, was found to be
hypotensive at 80/40 so he was sent to NWH. Cardiac enzymes
showed CK 339, MB 12.2, MBI 3.5, Trop I 30 and EKG revealed STE
V2-5 with Q waves. Given lovenox, lopressor and aspirin,
transferred here for ICU bed availability. No lytics were given
as the patient has a history of a SDH in [**11-17**].

In the ED, vitals showed T 97.7, BP 80/61, HR 75, RR 21, 91% on
six liters NC. Pressures remained stable in the 80-90s systolic
as previous fluids were finished.

Past Medical History:
1. Coronary artery disease:
    a. CABG ([**2164**])
2. Mitral valve replacement with severe MR
3. Atrial fibrillation s/p pacemaker ([**2176**])

OTHER PAST HISTORY:
1. Lung cancer: recently diagnosed
    - c/b post-obstructive pneumonia (on moxiflox)
2. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
3. Chronic kidney disease (SCr at baseline 1.2 on [**4-8**])
4. h/o GIB with PUD s/p gastrectomy
4. Hypothyroidism
5. Prostate cancer
6. h/o Subdural hematoma ([**11-17**]) while on coumadin
7. h/o Pelvic fracture in MVA ([**2133**])

Social History:
Social history is significant for the absence of current tobacco
use (quit in [**2164**]). There is no history of alcohol abuse.

Family History:
There is no family history of premature coronary artery disease
or sudden death.

.
EKG #1 ([**2179-4-9**] at 20:50) showed afib with rate of 70; left
axis; biphasic TW in V2-V4; ST-elevations in V2-V5 with Q-waves
in V2-V4.
.
2D-ECHOCARDIOGRAM ([**2179-4-10**]):
 The left atrium is markedly dilated. The right atrium is
markedly dilated. There is moderate regional left ventricular
systolic dysfunction with anteroseptal akinesis and apical
akinesis/dyskinesis. EF 35-40% No definite apical thrombus seen.
Mild to moderate ([**12-15**]+) mitral regurgitation. [3+] tricuspid
regurgitation.
.
Chest CT [**2179-4-14**]:
1. Secretions within the bronchus intermedius with post-
obstructive right middle and lower lobe collapse. Associated
endobronchial tumor cannot be excluded. Bronchoscopy would be
helpful for both therapeutic and diagnostic purposes.
2. Narrowing right upper lobe bronchus by right hilar
adenopathy. Bulky mediastinal adenopathy is consistent with
patient's history of malignancy. Comparison to outside studies
would be helpful as well as dedicated contrast- enhanced study
if the patient's renal function permits.
3. Bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left with
adjacent dependent atelectasis.
4. Mild interstitial edema and multichamber cardiomegaly.
5. Emphysema.
.
Pelvis xray:
Cortical irregularity of the right greater trochanter. CT is
recommended for further characterization of this finding.
.
[**2179-4-16**] pleural fluid cytology:
Pleural fluid: POSITIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS. Consistent with
metastatic adenocarcinoma.
[**2179-4-20**] pleural fluid: Pleural fluid: NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT
CELLS.
Mesothelial cells, some with reactive changes. Macrophages,
lymphocytes, and blood.


Brief Hospital Course:
1. STEMI/Coronary artery disease:
Presented with chest pain, elevated cardiac enzymes and EKG
changes which were consistent with an ST-elevation MI.  Q-waves
were present in V2-V4 (and a new finding).  Given the patient's
co-morbid conditions (including CKD), held off on
catheterization and decision was made to pursue medical
management only.  A head CT was obtained to evaluate for brain
mets and after this returned negative, a heparin gtt was
started.  Aspirin and statin were continued.  An echo was
obtained on HD2 which showed an EF of 35-40% and regional LV
wall motion abnormalities which included: mid anteroseptal -
akinetic; anterior apex - akinetic; septal apex- akinetic;
inferior apex - akinetic; lateral apex - akinetic; apex -
dyskinetic.  Given these finding, plan for 1 month of
anticoagulation with coumadin was planned (no longer given the
patient's history of a SDH and a GI bleed). Beta-blocker was
also started.  Atorvastatin was increased from 10mg daily to
40mg daily. On discharge the patient was bridged to coumadin
with lovenox.

2. Acute renal failure:
Baseline SCr of ~1.2 and a presenting Scr of 1.4.  This may have
represented decreased perfusion in the setting of his STEMI.
The plan was for optimization of forward flow.  His Cr trended
back to baseline and remained stable.  He had a small bump in
his Cr to 1.6 in the setting of diuresis which then trended down
and remained stable.

3. Lung cancer:
Recently diagnosed at OSH.  Records were obtained and confirmed
diagnosis of adenocarcinoma from bronhial washings.  He was
evaluated by Heme/Onc staff and felt to be at least T3 although
no formal staging was performed.  Oncology felt that the patient
was too frail and deconditioned to undergo chemo/xrt and the
plan was to follow up with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 3551**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 8631**] at [**Hospital1 **]
as outpatient to discuss possible palliative chemo vs. hospice.
No further management was done while an inpatient.  While at
[**Hospital1 18**] a repeat non-contrast chest CT was performed that showed
b/l pleural effusions and a likely R endobronchial tumor with
post- obstructive collapse of the right middle and lower lobes
in addition to hilar and mediastinal LAD.  IP was consulted for
possible bronch +/- stenting vs thoracentesis.  It was felt that
the patient would not tolerate a significant procedure including
general anesthesia and therefore a rigid bronch and stent was
not pursued.  Heme/Onc was consulted and agreed that the patient
would not tolerate chemo at the moment given his frailty and
recent significant MI.  Palliative care became involved to
fascilitate discussion about palliative options and possible
hospice.  Records from OSH remarked that the patient had uptake
in his pelvis so a pelvic xray was obtained to look for possible
mets.  The xray showed a cortical irregularity in the greater
trochanter on the right which was concerning for metastatic
disease.

During his hospital stay the patient had a significant oxygen
requirement with O2 sats 88-96% on 6L NC and 15L high flow
oxygen.  Chest xrays and CT demonstrated a large R pleural
effusion with RML and RLL collapse.  A large volume
thoracentesis was performed on [**4-16**] by IP and 2.5L of
