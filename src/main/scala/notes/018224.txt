HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Briefly, this is a 63 year old
male with a history of alcoholism, insulin dependent diabetes
mellitus, pancreatitis status post partial pancreatectomy who
presented with abdominal pain, decreased p.o., vomiting,
diaphoresis on [**2110-6-4**].  The patient was found to be in
ketoacidosis with low bicarb.  He was admitted to [**Hospital Ward Name 517**]
and then transferred to medical ICU on the day of admission
secondary to EKG changes and alcohol withdrawal symptoms.
The patient subsequently ruled in for a small MI and was
admitted to the medicine floor from the MICU on [**2110-6-7**].

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Alcohol abuse.  The patient reports drinking one pint per
night with a history of morning tremors.
2.  Hypertension.
3.  History of pancreatitis status post partial
pancreatectomy.
4.  Gastritis.
5.  Coronary artery disease with history of RCA occlusion, EF
of 25% to 30%.  The patient had cath in [**2-20**] which showed
hypokinetic anterior basal, anterior lateral, inferior and
posterior basal walls.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  NPH 8 units in the a.m. and 6
units in the p.m., Prilosec 20 mg p.o. q.d., Captopril 50 mg
p.o. t.i.d., folic acid 1 mg q.d., Wellbutrin SR 100 mg q.d.,
metoclopramide 10 mg q.i.d.

ALLERGIES:  Morphine and Motrin.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is married.  Positive tobacco
and alcohol history as previously mentioned.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On transfer to the floor from MICU the
patient was a well appearing, black male in no apparent
distress.  Answered questions, but not very conversant.
Appropriate.  Cardiovascular exam revealed regular rate and
rhythm, no murmurs, rubs or gallops.  Respirations were clear
to auscultation bilaterally.  Abdomen was soft, nontender,
nondistended with positive bowel sounds and old scars.
Extremities showed no clubbing, cyanosis or edema.

LABORATORY DATA:  On admission hematocrit was 40.4; by
discharge it had dropped to 33.4.  White blood cell remained
stable throughout admission at 6.  Platelet count went from
255 to 154.  INR was normal on check at 1.1.  Sodium on
admission was 134 and went down to 127 on discharge.  ALT and
AST remained in the 20s.  Amylase was initially 175 and went
down to 50 prior to discharge.  Lipase was 207 and went down
to 18 by discharge.  Troponin on [**6-5**] was elevated at 6.7 and
subsequently dropped to 3.7.  MB peak was 8.  The patient did
have large acetone on [**6-3**] was repeated and normal on [**6-5**].
Negative tox screen.  Chest x-ray during admission showed
COPD, left ventricular hypertrophy, but no CHF or pneumonia.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  Gastrointestinal.  The patient initially had pancreatitis
which resolved by enzymes.  He also had little p.o. intake on
admission, but his diet was eventually advanced to full with
minimal abdominal pain.  The patient was maintained on Reglan
and given Zantac during admission.  He was kept on aspirin
because of coronary artery disease, but ideally that would be
discontinued.

2.  Endocrinology.  The patient was initially on an insulin
drip which was able to be weaned and the patient was on his
outpatient regimen of NPH with regular insulin sliding scale
for coverage by discharge.  The patient also had pretty good
blood sugars prior to discharge.

3.  Cardiovascular.  The patient suffered a small myocardial
infarction as seen by increase in MB as well as troponin.
Cardiology followed the patient throughout his admission and
recommended medical management only.  The patient was maxed
on Lopressor and ACE inhibitor.

4.  Fluids, electrolytes and nutrition.  The patient
developed low sodium during his admission.  This was felt
secondary to low p.o. intake and the patient has been
encouraged to free water restrict, but eat a regular diet and
drink salty type fluids.  The patient will need this checked
as an outpatient.

5.  Renal.  The patient initially had respiratory alkalosis
which resolved, followed by metabolic acidosis which also
resolved.

6.  Psych.  The patient was initially on the CIWA scale with
Ativan coverage, but little Ativan was needed and the patient
was weaned off CIWA after several days.  The patient did
receive thiamine, folate, multivitamin for his history of
alcoholism.
