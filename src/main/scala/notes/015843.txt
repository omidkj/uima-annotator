Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2817**]
Chief Complaint:
R femoral intertrochanter fracture

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
ORIF

History of Present Illness:
The Pt. is a [**Age over 90 **]y/o M with PMH of Dementia, AF, DVT admitted with
R trochanteric fracture after falling out of his wheelchair. Per
report, the patient was admitted to an OSH for behavioral
disturbance thought secondary to Alzheimers and was found this
am after falling out of his wheelchair at 0730, he walked back
to bed with assistance. At 1330 he began complaining of R hip
pain and was noted to have a shortened and rotated leg. He was
taken to an OSH where he was found to have a R femoral
trochanteric fracture with minimal displacement. At OSH HR
140s-150s with SBP in 90s. He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for
further management.

Brief Hospital Course:
Assessment & Plan: The patient is a [**Age over 90 **]y/o M with a PMH of
Alzheimer's Dementia and Atrial fibrillation presenting s/p fall
with R femoral intertrochanteric fracture.
.
# R femoral intertrochanteric fracture - s/p fall. Xray
demonstrates minimal displacement. Orthopedics consulted and
recommended operative management. Consent was eventually
obtained from patient's family; code status was reversed for
operation and PACU only. Orthopedics placed an intratrochanteric
[**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] operation which was without complication. His
post-operative course was complicated by atrial fibrillation
with RVR, and he was transferred back to the MICU for further
monitoring and rate control (see below). On post-operative day
#2 incision site was clean, dry, intact on dressing change.
[**First Name3 (LF) 1957**] recommended no restrictions on activity, advised 2 weeks
total course of Lovenox, 30 mg daily.

Followup orthopedics appointment scheduled with [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], NP.  [**2118-8-9**], at 11 am.  [**Hospital Ward Name 23**] Building,
[**Location (un) **].
.
Morphine was given for pain control; this should be weaned to PO
and then to non-opiate medications as tolerated.
.
# Atrial Fibrillation with RVR - Per records the patient has not
been on a nodal [**Doctor Last Name 360**] due to history of bradycardia, family
previously declined pacemaker. He also has not been
anticoagulated. Responded well to diltiazem in ED, transitioned
to beta blocker for pre-op management.  Further episodes of RVR
post-operatively, with transfer back to MICU for close
management.  ECG without ischemic changes, Trop with slight
elevation to 0.03, likely secondary to transient demand from
rapid rate.  Pain was controlled with morphine. Digoxin was
started for rate control. A fluid bolus was given for presumed
hypovolemia, with good response. He was discharged with the plan
to continue digoxin upon discharge. A non-trough digoxin level
was 4.2 on the morning of discharge, likely based on an extra
dose of digoxin given in the morning of discharge. See "digoxin
level" as separate issue as below. Beta blocker was stopped as
he became mildly bradycardic, and was not prescribed for
discharge due to previous history of bradycardia. Pain control
will be important in his post-operative heart rate management.
.
# Digoxin level. As above, a non-trough digoxin level was 4.2 on
the morning of discharge, likely due to a recent extra dose of
digoxin. This should be followed closely and digoxin held if
levels continue to be supratherapeutic. We recommend holding the
[**7-28**] dose of digoxin. It has already been given on [**7-27**].
.
# Leukocytosis - This was judged likely to be reactive secondary
to hip fracture. His CXR was without evidence of infiltrate. UA
with 21-50 WBC, mod leuks/neg nitrites. Received Vanc/zosyn in
ED. Afebrile.  Urine culture returned negative, leukocytosis
resolved.  Antibiotics were stopped. Separately, cefazolin was
given peri-operatively.
.
# Alzheimer's Dementia - Per records the patient was recently
hospitalized for behavioral disturbances. Patient started on
zyprexa 2.5mg QHS and citalopram and trazodone discontinued.
Increased agitation post-operatively, Zyprexa dose increased to
5 [**Hospital1 **].
.
# CHF - unclear baseline EF, echo (suboptimal image quality)
showed EF 40%, preserved biventricular systolic function.
Diuretic held during MICU course in the setting of fluid
resuscitation.  Plan to restart diuretic in 3 days ([**2118-7-30**]) or
sooner if weight increase of >3 pounds.
.
# FEN - NPO peri-operatively, started back on regular diet,
thickened puree consistency. Speech and swallow was consulted
and recommended continuing honey-thick liquids and pureed solids
with careful monitoring of fluid status and re-evaluation of
swallowing ability as he improves post-operatively. Because
honey-thick liquids often results in decreased fluid intake,
nectar-thick liquids should be considered and fluid status
should be carefully monitored. Electrolytes stable.
.
# Access - Midline and 18 gauge IV
.
# Prophylaxis - Home PPI continued during stay, Lovenox started
post-operatively, to be continued for total course of 2 weeks
post-op, as above per [**Month/Day/Year **] recommendations. Consider heparin SC
or lovenox for DVT/PE prophylaxis thereafter.
.
# Code - DNR/DNI (reversed for procedure and PACU only, back to
DNR/DNI post-operatively)
.
# Dispo - transfer back to Radius with care instructions and
medication changes.
