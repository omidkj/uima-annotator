History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 1007**] is a 37 year old male with history of idiopathic
pancreatitis who presents from [**Hospital 15405**] with necrotizing
pancreatitis.  He initially presented on [**12-13**] with one day
history of severe abdominal pain/LLQ pain/epigastric pain
radiating to left scrotum.  Also with nausea and dry heaves but
no emesis.  Went to ED for evaluation and found to have elevated
amylase (424 --> 681) and lipase (1245 --> 1154).  CT scan of
abdomen demonstrated significant necrotizing pancreatitis with
significant abnormal pleural fluid.  Patient was hypotensive and
was on dopamine intially but weaned off after recieving
approximately 4L of IVF's over 2 days.  He also become
tachycardic to 170's and was treated with lopressor 5mg IV,
repeated an unclear number of times.  He also had a recurrent
fever (Tm 105) and was hypoxia with O2 sats in low 90's on 6-8L
high flow.  He was seen by gastroenterology and treated with
aldactone 50 [**Hospital1 **] and lasix for ascites and to improve urine
output.  He had been receiving dilaudid 2-4 mg IV Q2H prn for
pain.  Because of the worsening CT scan on [**12-15**] and clinical
deterioration, patient transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further
management.

Pt arrived on floor looking comfortable and without respiratory
distress.  Related no abdominal pain d/t pain meds.  No chest
pain, SOB, or other discomforts.  + fevers, no chills.  No URI
sxs, no dysuria.

CT scan abd/pelvis ([**2141-12-15**]): Severe pancreatitis, prominent
areas of nonengancement are seen involving the pancreas
suggestion possible necrotic changes (enhancement of head,
protion of tail, patchy through body).  No interval change in
the extensive amount of fluid within the abdomen and pelvis.
Increased amount of pleural fluid.  Liver with fatty
infiltration.  Some minmal fatty sparing surrounding the
gallbladder and gallbladder is minimally dilated.  Low density
foci throughout the spleen.  One or two small stones in left
kidney and rounded hyperdensity in right kidney d/t small cyst.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 1007**] is a 37 year old male with h/o pancreatitis who
presents with necrotizing pancreatitis, now with delirium
suspected [**1-11**] alcohol withdrawal, although pt and family deny
alcohol use.

1)Necrotizing pancreatitis - 40% necrotized on admission CT scan
to our institution, with preservation of pancreatic head and
tail.  Possible etiologies include ETOH, gallstones (none seen
on admission CT scan), obstruction (ruled-out with RUQ u/s),
hypertriglyceridemia (triglycerides only mildly elevated in
200s), hypercalcemia, drugs (unlikely; pt only taking atenolol
at home), infection, and trauma (no history of trauma). Most
likely ETOH, although patient and his family adamantly deny EtOH
other than a drink at [**Holiday **]. Repeat CT showed overall
improved appearance of pancreas although there is some
organization of pancreatic inflammation.  He was initially kept
NPO with NGT to suction.  He subsequently received post-pyloric
tube feeds while intubated, but pulled out his NGT following
extubation.  As pancreatic enzymes trended downwards and his
clinical status improved, his diet was advanced. He also
completed a 7d course of Meropenem for necrotizing pancreatitis.
Surgery followed him closely throughout his hospital stay.

2)Fevers: Patient presented with persistent fevers throughout
his hospital stay. Daily blood and urine cultures were
unrevealing. Both pancreatitis and withdrawal can cause fever.
Ruled out acalculous cholecystitis with RUQ US. Patient also
presented with diarrhea, but c.diff was negative. He was
empirically started on Flagyl and Zosyn but the latter was
stopped due to development of a rash.

3)Delirium/? ETOH withdrawal:  Per psychiatric evaluation and
high benzodiazepine requirement, acute mental status changes
likely secondary to EtOH withdrawal.  Constellation of symptoms
includes tachycardia, tremulousness, agitation, coupled with a
history of recurrent pancreatitis.  Head CT without intracranial
abnormalities. He was placed on empiric thiamine, folate, and
B12. The patient was intubated electively for airway protection
since he required large doses of sedatives. At time of discharge
his mental status had returned to baseline.

4)Respiratory: On admission, patient was tachypneic despite
large doses of BZDs for withdrawal and as a result, was
electively intubated. He was successfull extubated once his
clinical status improved and his BZD requirement was decreased.
Cxray showed large L pleural effusion, likely secondary to
pancreatitis.

5)Hyperglycemia: Likely new onset diabetes secondary to necrosis
of his pancreatic beta cells.  Now with new insulin requirement
> 100 units per day while on TPN.  He was initially maintained
on insulin gtt with increasing requirements but was transitioned
to a sliding scale as his clinical status improved. He no longer
required insulin at time of discharge.

6)HTN: Patient was started on low dose beta-blocker and was
discharged on Atenolol.

7)FEN: Patient was initially maintained on TPN and tube feeds.
Once he self d/c'ed his NGT his diet was slowly advanced with
help of nutrition. At time of discharge patient was able to
tolerate regular diet without any complications.

Medications on Admission:
Atenolol 50 mg PO QD
