.
Patient reports that he has had COPD for many years and has
dyspnea on exertion. Starting one week ago however, patient

exposures. Patient started prednisone at home per his PCP
instructions, however his symptoms did not improve. PCP office
instructed patient to present to ED for further evaluation.
.
In the ED, Temp 97.7, HR 122, BP 151/80 and RR 32 at 2L NC with
96% saturation. Patient however remained tachypneic with
increasing supplemental oxygen doses, and eventually was placed
on Bipap at 30% FIO2 at 12/8 with good respose in symptoms.
Patient was given IV solumedrol, Ceftriaxone and azithromycin,
aspirin, and admitted to ICU for further management.
Review of systems is otherwise unremarkable.

Urine and blood cultures neg/pending

[**2159-2-1**] ECHO:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric
left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is
mildly dilated. There is mild regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction with mild inferior wall hypokinesis. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic root is moderately dilated at the sinus level. The aortic
valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is moderate to
severe aortic valve stenosis (area 0.8-1.0cm2). Trace aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate [2+]
tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. Significant pulmonic regurgitation
is seen. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2158-10-30**],
the left ventricular function is low normal with worsened mitral
regurgitation and aortic stenosis.

Brief Hospital Course:
81 year old man with history of COPD, presenting with acute
respiratory distress
.
#. RESPIRATORY DISTRESS: Pt was initially treated for COPD
exacerbation with IV steroids, nebs and antibiotics. By the next
day, pt was able to be weaned from bipap to 3L NC and was
satting comfortably in the mid 90s.  Given elevation in troponin
however and evidence of mild pulmonary edema on CXR and
peripheral edema, there was concern for CHF. A TTE confirmed
worsening valvular disease compared to ECHO preformed several
months prior.  Pt. was seen by cardiology who recommended BB if
tol. by COPD, no other interventions.  They felt he was
euvolemic at the time of examination and recommended against
further diuresis.
.
#. NSTEMI: Pt's troponin peaked at .23 on admission. He had had
no prior known cardiac disease, and was never seen by a
cardiologist. EKGs were repeatedly at baseline. He was treated
with full dose aspirin, statin and was started on low dose beta
blocker with holding parameters at HR <70 to avoid poor filling.
Pt was seen by cardiology who felt he was medically optimized.
.
#. CHRONIC RENAL INSUFFICIENCY: Pt remained at his recently new
baseline of 2.5.

#. Hypertension: Home BP meds were intially held as his regimen
was adjusted for new worsening valvular disease and NSTEMI.
