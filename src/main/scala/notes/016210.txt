History of Present Illness:
[**Known firstname 4333**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 92570**] is a 79y/o woman with extensive medical history
(includes DM2, HTN, HL, BrCa s/p bilateral masectomy,
MVR-porcine
and ?afib on warfarin and BB, ?anxiety, ?stroke on ASA; details
unclear at this time). She is at this time intubated and
unresponsive on a propofol drip. The available history is from
the OSH notes at bedside. She was last known well to family or
friends yesterday (Thursday). She was found down by a her son
this morning when he visited her home after she did not answer
the repeated phone calls. She was lying next to her bed, slumped
against her nightstand, with an abrasion on her back and no
obvious signs of head trauma. Based on her routine, he thinks
that she had been awake already and that she probably fell
around
9:30am because she already had her newspaper inside. He thinks
it
was a sudden problem because not only did she fail to answer the
phone, but she did not even press the help button on her
LifeResponse wristband.

She was BIBA to the OSH around noon, where she was noted to be
"alert but confused" with no spontaneous movements of the right
side of her body. Her mental status declined and she was
intubated (induced with ketamine and paralyzed with vecuronium).
Her VS were remarkable for SBP ranging from 140s up to 178
(@12:30pm) with HR 110-143. RR 22 SaO2 96% on 4L. A NCHCT was
performed and revealed a large (~4cm/irregular) hemorrhage
originating in the Left basal ganglia with intraventricular
extension. INR 1.5. She was transferred here on a propofol gtt.
On arrival, her SBPs were in the 160s, but with increased
propofol by nursing @NCHCT she has trended down to the 100s over
70s currently. She was noted to open eyes briefly and move all
extremities spontaneously except for the Right leg.

A NCHCT was obtained here, and showed enlarging temporal horns
(L>r). INR 1.5 again. Neurosurgery was consulted and advised but
did not pursue a goals-of-care discussion with the family (with
anticipation of EVD placement for ICP management). and advised
that Neurology be consulted as well.

Her son on the phone mentioned that she had been falling and
fainting or seizing often recently. The son thinks the falls
were
due to [**Name (NI) **] and had lessened after her Pulmonologist changed
or stopped that medication. She bumped her head 2wks ago and had
an MRI a few weeks ago; he thinks the MRI was "clean" w.r.t.
stroke. He thinks she may have been having "mini-seizures," by
which he means brief episodes of feeling "faint" in her chair
during which she would say "OK, its doing it again," then appear
shaky with eyes rolled back "like she is passing out" followed
by
full return to normal versus sometimes a confused state in which
she thinks her husband is still alive or the room has changed
colors. She is following with a Neurologist named Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1774**], who has not as far as the son knows started any AEDs.

Review of Systems: unable (pt non-responsive).

Past Medical History:
1. HTN (only on BB)
2. MVR (porcine, [**2128**]) on warfarin A/C
3. ?afib (in afib on arrival and on warfarin)
4. ?HL (on statin)
5. ?COPD (on Spireva recently)
6. DM2 (on metformin)
7. ?recent stroke (OSH) versus "mini-seizures" (son) with recent
MRI, results unknown
8. ?CHF (pt on Lasix/KCl at home)
9. ?pain syndrome or neuropathy (pt on high-dose Lyrica at home)

Physical Exam:
ON ADMISSION:
Vital signs:
T: afeb per nsg
P/HR: 100-130, irregular on monitor (presumed afib)
BP: 108/7x - 117/75 (on my exam), up to 160s SBP on arrival
RR: 20s-30s
SaO2: 98% on vent

General: Intubated, sedated with propofol gtt, which I stopped
for exam. NAD.
HEENT: ETT, OGT. Normocephalic and atraumatic. No scleral
icterus. Mucous are moist. Hazy corneal spot at 7-o'clock
overlying the [**Doctor First Name 2281**].
Neck: Supple, with full passive range of motion. No bruits. No
lymphadenopathy.
Pulmonary: Good air movement bilaterally with transmitted
upper-airway sounds related to ETT/vent. No crackles or wheezes.
Overbreathing into the 20s, non-labored, no retractions.
Cardiac: Rapid, irregular, loud/sharp S2 loudest over apex. No
loud murmur or rub. No S3.
Abdomen: Soft, non-tender, and non-distended.
Extremities: Cool, but well-perfused. No significant edema.
Intact distal pulses bilaterally.

*****************
Neurologic examination: off propofol for 10-15min.

Mental Status:
Does not open eyes to voice or sternal rub. Right eye hangs
slightly open. Later opened eyes for just a few seconds.
Reliably
followed command to squeeze Left hand (not right hand).
Intermittently followed command to open fingers of left hand
(but
not thumbs-up or anything else semi-complex). No blink to
threat.
Slight Leftward gaze deviation. Briely looked to the left on
command, but not repeatable. but no tracking (including $20).

-Cranial Nerves:
II: PERRL, 3 to 2mm, brisk. No blink to threat in any direction.
Cannot see fundi through her dense cataracts.
III, IV, VI: Pt overrides dolls-eyes/OCR and does not move eyes
or track, so unable to assess EOM beyond conjugate at slight
left
mid-position with no nystagmus.
V: Corneals and nasopharyngeal brow-wrikle reflexes intact
bilaterally, but much more pronounced on the Left than right.
VII: Right eye hangs open a few mm and does not stay closed when
I close it. Right face seems slack -- not evident in upper face
(brow-furrow in response to noxious stimulation) except for
slack
eyelid closure on that side. Minimal resistence to eyelid
opening.
VIII: Hearing grossly intact (at one point follows command to
squeeze and release fingers repeatedly). No Doll's eyes
(?actively suppressed due to level of consciousness).
IX, X: Strong gag to ETT tug. Strong cough to tracheal suction.
Overbreathing vent (set 16, breathing 20-30).
[**Doctor First Name 81**], XII: cannot assess.

-Motor:
Purposeful/spontaneous movements:
Tone: RLE is flaccid and externally-rotated. Normal to slightly
decreased tone in the UEs and LLE. No spasticity.
Adventitious movements: none
Withdrawal: triple-flexion type response, brisk #RLE; +/- @LLE.

-Sensory:
No withdrawal (except LE triple-flex) to noxious stimulation of
extremities.

-Reflexes (left; right):
Biceps (++;++)
Triceps  (+;+)
Brachioradialis (++;++)
Quadriceps / patellar (+;++)
Gastroc-soleus / achilles (0;0)
Plantar response was briskly EXtensor bilaterally (Rt > lt).

-Coordination/Gait: cannot assess
.
ON DISCHARGE:
Vitals: on the patient's respiratory rate was being monitored @
18-24.
Patient was awake, makes eye contact, but is non-verbal. She
squeezes hand on left, unclear to command or reflex. No movement
on right side.
