Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2569**]
Chief Complaint:
Acute right sided hemiparesis and aphasia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
CT Angiogram with MERCI retrieval of intracranial clot with
successdul revascularization of Left MCA

History of Present Illness:
This 39 y/o woman with history mitral valvular disease, s/p
valvuloplasty and new onset atrial fibrillation today and prior
right hemiphere stroke presents with aphasia and right
hemiplegia.

Per report, she was in USOH this morning, having gone to work at
beauty salon.  Her husband last saw her well at 0830h.  At
1000h, she was found on floor of salon, alert but aphasic and
right hemiplegic.  EMS was activated, she was brought to [**Hospital 82235**] ER.  The neurologic deficit was documented, quantified
as NIHSS=24.  SBP 110s, HR 80s and irregular, WBC 9, Hct 41, Plt
189, INR 1.1, PTT 26.  Head CT said to be unremarkable.  The
patient's husband consented to IV tPA; however the consulatant
neurologist deemed the patient not a candidate for IV tPA due to
severe quantified deficit.  [**Hospital1 18**] stroke service contact[**Name (NI) **].  The
patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].

At [**Hospital1 18**] ER, the patient was found to be aphasic, right
hemiplegic.  SBP 130s, HR 80s.  Sats in 90s with obtundation so
patient was intubated electively w/ Fentanyl and Versed.

ECHO [**2117-4-22**] - IMPRESSION: No cardiac source of embolism seen
(cannot exclude [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] LAA thrombus on a trans-thoracic echo).
There is characteristic rheumatic deformity of the mitral valve
with moderate mitral stenosis and at least mild mitral
regurgitation. Normal regional and global biventricular systolic
function. Mild aortic regurgitation. Mild pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension.

HCT pre-IA tPA and MERCI -
Right, predominantly white matter hypodensities as detailed
above, concerning for areas of stroke. Please note that per
report, this patient is being transferred emergently to the
interventional service in view of further imaging studies to
characterize possible infarctions. Recommend repeat evaluation
with contrast or MR head when clinically able to tolerate repeat
imaging. The left MCA is dense suggestive of left middle
cerebral artery thrombosis.

HCT post IA tPA and MERCI -
1. Interval hemorrhagic transformation of the left MCA infarct,
with acute
hemorrhage seen within the left basal ganglia and caudate head,
with small
scattered foci of petechial hemorrhage.
2. Interval malacic changes involving the right frontal,
temporal and
parietal lobes, likely from prior infarct/insult.

MRI Brain -
1. Hemorrhagic transformation of a left MCA territorial infarct
within the
left basal ganglia and left caudate head. Additional scattered
foci of
restricted diffusion within the left frontal, parietal, and
temporal lobes
compatible with areas of acute infarct.

2. Stable encephalomalacic changes within the right MCA
distribution.


Brief Hospital Course:
Pt was admitted after at 1000h, she was found on floor of salon,
alert but aphasic and right hemiplegic.  EMS was activated, she
was brought to [**Hospital3 68**] ER.  The neurologic deficit was
documented, quantified as NIHSS=24.  SBP 110s, HR 80s and
irregular, WBC 9, Hct 41, Plt 189, INR 1.1, PTT 26.  Head CT
said to be unremarkable.  The patient's husband consented to IV
tPA; however the consulatant
neurologist deemed the patient not a candidate for IV tPA due to
severe deficits and high NIHSS.  [**Hospital1 18**] stroke service contact[**Name (NI) **].
 The patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].  At [**Hospital1 18**] ER, the patient
was found to be aphasic, right
hemiplegic.  SBP 130s, HR 80s.  Sats in 90s with obtundation so
patient was intubated electively w/ fentanyl and versed. Pt went
to the Angio suite for IA tPA with insertion of MERCI appartus.
Her intracerebral thrombosis was successfully retrieved with
full revascularization of her Left MCA. Post-Angio, she was
noted to have faint right femoral pulses. Her pulses were
monitored post-angio with doppler eval of pulses. Post-IA tPA
and MERCI, she was noted to have a basal ganglia hemorrhage.
Post HCT showed an overal stable hemorrhage with edematous
changes to the area of stroke with slight midline shift. Pt
obtained another Head CT on [**2117-4-22**] which was overall stable. Pt
obtained a bedside TTE. Sedation was removed and she was
extubated on [**2117-4-22**]. Pt had a repeat MRI Brain on [**2117-4-22**] for
planned anticoagulation on [**2117-4-23**].

Neuro: Patient was started on Coumadin 6 days after admission
after repeat head CT showed no worsening of hemorrhage given her
Afib.  Currently, her INR was supratherapeutic to INR of 4.8 she
needs daily INR and restarted on Coumadin likely Coumadin 2.5mg
when INR < 3 with goal INR between 2~3.

Cardiovascular: Patient remains in Afib with occasional
tachycardia.  She was seen per cardiology who recommended
digoxin and rate control with metoprolol  Metoprolol may
