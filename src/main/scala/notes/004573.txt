Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2758**]
Chief Complaint:
respiratory distress

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2132-9-3**] - laryngoscopy

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 79022**] is a 20 M transferred from [**Hospital3 **] for
management of respiratory distress. The patient presented to MH
on [**8-29**] w fever, SOB, and pleuritic chest pain. His evaluation
was notable for a WBC count of 17 and CXR with a right lower
lobe infiltrate. He was admitted and started on levaquin for
treatment of a presumed community acquired pneumonia. However,
he had persistent fevers and his antibiotics were broadened to
also include ceftriaxone, vancomycin, and acyclovir. He was also
started on steroids for an inhalational injury given his
employment history. Other notable studies during that
hospitalization were the following:
 - a transthoracic echocardiogram to evaluate for pericarditis
that revealed mild left atrial enlargement with no other
abnormalities
 - LFTs on admission with normal AST, ALT, and an elevated total
bili of 2.0
 - RUQ US with no obstruction but a questionable pathcy
echogenicities in the liver parenchyma of unclear etiology
 - bronchoscopy on [**9-1**] demonstrating ulcerative pharyngitis and
granulomatous lesions on his upper pharynx, remaining airway
hyperemic
 - microbiology from this brochoscopy revealed negative viral
studies, no bacterial culture growth, and negative silver stain
for pneumocystis
 - PECT with no evidence of PE

He remained on 60% face mask and was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for
further evaluation.

ROS on transfer: He reports his father recently had a URI, but
no other sick contacts. [**Name (NI) **] is monogamous with 1 female partner,
inconsistent use of protection, but to his knowledge she does
not have herpes. Her reported no dysuria, penile discharge, or
recent oral/labial blisters. Other systems reviewed and
otherwise negative.

At time of transfer to [**Hospital1 18**]: he was afebrile (last fever
[**2132-9-1**]) and was 94% on a face mask with 45% F1O2. The patient
had a white blood cell count of 11.2, HCT 35.3, Na 139, K 3.5,
Cl 101, Bicarb 30, BUN 12, Cr 0.6, and a CXR w diffuse pulmonary
infiltrates. He was initially admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] ICU. His
supplemental oxygen was weaned to 6LNC. He was treated with
ceftriaxone and levofloxacin and transferred to the floor.

Past Medical History:
Pt reports hx of oral sores since the age of 3yrs.  Per mother,
pt would have up to 8 sores on tongue and buccal muscoa, white
in color, and painful, that would last for 1wk at a time.  Pt
would be otherwise asymptomatic during these episodes.  These
occured rather frequently until the patient's teenage years.

9 months prior to presentation, the patient developed a
persistant sore throat without any systemic or upper respiratory
symptoms. He was evaluated as an outpatient at [**Hospital3 **]
and the [**State 8181**] ED.  At [**Hospital 13128**], he
was given azithromax, valacyclovir, and medrol.  The patient
reports he underwent laryngoscopy and was told he had lesions on
his pharynx.

Illicits:  denies IVDU, marijuana

Family History:

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 79022**] is a 20 M with a medical history of frequent oral
ulcers who was transferred from an outside hospital with
respiratory distress and fever that was slow to resolve despite
broad-spectrum antibiotic and antiviral therapy. Ultimately this
was all felt to be secondary to community acquired pneumonia
though the causative organism was never identified (all cultures
negative, IgM for mycoplasma negative, and urinary Legionella
antigen negative). After arrival to [**Hospital1 18**] he was treated with
ceftriaxone and levofloxacin. He had marked improvement and by
the time of discharge was breathing comfortably on room air with
normal oxygen saturations and ambulating around the [**Hospital1 **] without
difficulty. He was discharged on levofloxacin to complete a
total 10-day course of antibiotics.

Of note, given his severe illness and atypical history of oral
ulcers he underwent a number of other investigations. He was
evaluated by the infectious disease team (contact: ID fellow,
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and underwent HIV Ab and viral load testing
(both negative) and levels of Ig were checked. He had a
borderline low IgG and IgG subclasses were sent. These were
pending at discharge and will be followed up by Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] at his [**2132-9-26**] follow-up appointment with her.

Other notable investigations include his repeat laryngoscopy by
ENT (contact: ENT fellow Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 38669**] that revealed small white
plaque on epiglottis. He will follow-up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] for repeat
evaluation on [**9-17**].

Finally, he had abnormal LFTs. At admission to the outside
hospital he had a total bilirubin of 2.0 with normal AST and
ALT. A RUQ at the outside hospital was reported as demonstrating
patchy echogenicities in the liver parenchyma of unclear
etiology. After arrival to the [**Hospital1 18**] he had a mild elevations in
his AST and ALT that were improving at discharge. These will
need to be repeated at a future visit, either with his first
visit with his new PCP, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) 15785**] on [**9-19**], or with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] on [**9-26**]. Given the results of the repeat LFTs,
consideration can be given for repeat RUQ US and serologies for
viral hepatitis. He also had mildly elevated blood glucose
levels while on steroids and should be evaluated for impaired
glucose tolerance.

To Do:
 - follow-up with ENT
 - repeat LFTs as above
 - consider screening for diabetes as above
 - follow-up IgG subclass testing
