Attending:[**Doctor First Name 1402**]
Chief Complaint:
chestpain/nausea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **]yo Russian speaking only F with MI x 3, s/p RCA hepacoat
stents
x5 [**8-24**] and RCA Cypher stents x 5 in same location on [**10-12**] for
STEMI who presents with chest pain from [**Hospital 100**] Rehab. The pain
radiates from her back to her L axilla or starts in her L axilla
and radiates to her L shoulder blade.  It is not assoc with
diaphoresis, is +/- assoc with SOB, is not associated with
exercise.  It comes more often in the morning and lasts for 2
hours.  Is not assoc with moving her arm.  Nitro has tended to
improve it.  It is sometimes assoc with eating.  The pain has
been going on for days, but on day of presentation, the pain was
not relieved with 3 nitro.  She describes the pain as very
different than the pain that brought her in recently with an MI.
.
In ED, her intial vitals were HR 60's BP 194/83 and EKG showed Q
in III and aVF and inverted T's in II, III, aVF and V4-V6 with
no ST changes.  It looked improved from her recent D/C EKG.  HCT
was 25, decreased from 32.8 on [**10-15**].  In the ED she got BB,
MSO4 2mg, ASA, and a nitro drip with resolution of her CP.  She
was then transferred to F3 for further management.

Brief Hospital Course:
BRIEF OVERVIEW: [**Age over 90 **] yo F h/o 3VD s/p stenting x 2 with a total of
10 stents in RCA. Last stenting [**10-12**] for STEMI. Presented with
atypical CP in setting of anemia and hypertension.  She was
admitted to the cardiology service after a CT that was negative
for dissection and a non-contrast abd CT that revealed no
intraperitoneal process.  The patient complained of nausea and
had some vomiting in the hospital.  She also complained of a
number of different types of chest pain over her first 24 hours
of hospitalization.  Repeated EKG's showed no changes c/w
ischemia.  N/V was controlled acutely with anzemet.  CP was
reproducible by palpation.  Pt was discovered to have had
longstanding N/V at home with a negative upper endoscopy in [**2153**]
per her daughter.  She was started on reglan with some relief.
.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM:
#Cardiac:
a) Ischemia: The patient had a history of thrombus to RCA with
TO of RCA and 5
hepacoat stents. 2 weeks prior to this admission, she was taken
to the cath lab for STEMI and had 5 Cypher stents to same area
of RCA for restenosis.  She was also known to have diffuse 3VD
on catheterization. EKG at this admission showed improvement
from EKG at discharge from last admission. She continuee to have
inverted T's inf and lat, and q's inf, but no ST changes. Three
sets of enzymes were negative. Her pain was not consistent with
typical CP (reproduced with palpation, not assoc with exercise).
However, pt was anemic and hypertensive, and may have had some
ongoing ischemia. She had had a recent cath with known 3VD. She
was not a surgical candidate and a repeat cath was thought to be
unlikely to have been helpful. Therefore, she was to be
medically optimized at this hospitalization. CP could also have
been explained to some degree by her recent PNA.  She was
continued on aspirin, plavix, and statin.  Because she had CP in
the ED, she was started on a nitro drip to make her pain free.
This was weaned off overnight.  Because her BP was 190-200 in
the ED, she was started on an increased dose of metoprolol and
hydralazine was added to her regimen.  Her BP was brought to the
120's overnight and in the morning, when the patient was seen to
have had a baseline creatinine even after the dye load she
received with her CTA in the ED, she was restarted on valsartan
80 (which was held at her last hospitalization for low BP).
Imdur was restarted at 120 qd after the nitro drip was weaned
off.  During the first 2 days, the patient complained of mild
TTP over her L chest wall, but no spontaneous chest pain.  The
waxing/[**Doctor Last Name 688**] nature of this chest pain and its lack of
associated symptoms and its chronicity (from her last
hospitalization until now) with hours of pain that can be
reproduced is c/w atypical CP.  While there may be a component
of angina, given her known 3VD, it will be managed medically.
.
b) pump: The patient has a known HTN history with known
diastolic CHF. Her EF in [**1-25**] was >65%, however her estimated EF
in bedside echo at last admission immediately post-MI was around
50%.  Echo will need to be repeated as an outpatient in [**1-24**]
weeks to evaluate her true EF post-MI.  The [**Initials (NamePattern4) 228**] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] was
held at her last hospitalization for rising creatinine and low
BP as stated above. As above, valasartan was restarted the
morning after admission to control the pt's BP, however with
worsening [**Doctor First Name 48**] this was discontinued.  Pt had one episode of
flash pulm edema in setting of high BP in the morning.  She was
diuresed aggresively and this resolved.  On day of discharge she
had an episode of some lightheadedness with SBP of 76.  She had
received BB, Imdur and Lasix earli
