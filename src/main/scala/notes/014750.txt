History of Present Illness:
This is a 68 yo M with a history of MDS RAEB type 1 with
myelofibrosis s/p Cycle 1 decitabine ending [**2135-6-9**], COPD,
chronic decubitus ulcers, and neutrophilic dermatosis who has
been admitted for further evaluation of weakness.

The patient was recently admitted from [**Date range (1) 73067**] with fever.
During this admission, he was found to have a pan-S E. coli,
Vancomycin sensitive enterococcus, and [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 564**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 563**] blood
stream infection.  He had a TTE which did not show signs of
endocarditis and a dilated eye exam which did not show [**Female First Name (un) 564**]
endophthalmitis.  He received a two week course of Vancomycin
and Cefepime and a plan was made for thirty days of Fluconazole
(first negative blood culture for yeast [**2135-6-19**]).  There was also
concern for a multifocal pneumonia in the RUL on chest imaging
during the [**Date range (1) 73067**] admit.  The patient underwent BAL on
[**2135-7-1**], with negative cultures.  Lastly, he was found to have a
transaminitis and hyperbilirubinemia of unclear etiology during
his last admission (ALT 226, AST 235, T Bili 11.3).  These lab
abnormalities resolved without GI intervention.

The patient was discharged on [**7-5**] to home, which is his
daughter's home in [**Location (un) 3844**].  The patient reports initially
feeling well, but then over the last five days, started to
experience decrease appetite and fatigue.  Initially, he thought
the decrease in appetite was secondary to a change in taste
caused by Fluconazole; thus, he stopped taking the Fluconazole
for a few days.  He felt better, but then noticed return of the
symptoms.  The fatigue increased to the point that he started
using a walker at home and even started to notice difficulty
getting up from the bed.  He denies any fevers, chills,
vomiting, new rash, blurry vision, shortness of breath, chest
pain, or headache.  He has chronic nausea and diarrhea, which
have continued.  He has also noticed a new pain below his right
rib cage which is worse with inspiration.

Brief Hospital Course:
68yo man with MDS/AML admitted for weakness/fatigue, diarrhea
(high ostomy output), and dehydration.  He completed cycle #1
decitabine [**2135-6-9**].  This was complicated by recently admitted
from [**Date range (1) 73067**] with fever.  During this admission, he was found
to have a pan-S E. coli, Vancomycin sensitive enterococcus, and
[**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 564**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 563**] blood stream infection requiring
hospitalization [**2135-6-12**] and treatment with cefepime/vancomycin
x2wks, and fluconazole x30 days (1st negative blood culture for
yeast [**2135-6-19**]).  TTE and ophthalmic exam for [**Female First Name (un) 564**]
endophthalmitis were both negative.  Also, imaging showed RUL
infiltrate.  BAL [**2135-7-1**] had negative cultures.  Transaminitis
and hyperbilirubinemia of unclear etiology (ALT 226, AST 235, T
Bili 11.3) resolved without GI intervention.  He was admitted
with fatigue.
.
# Weakness/fatigue: Possibly due to dehydration vs. progressive
disease vs. infection (recurrence of recent multi-organism
sepsis) vs. post-chemo effect (unlikely with decitabine).  He
received IV fluids.  TSH and cortisol were normal.  Blood and
urine cultures were sent: urine culture grew  and IV fluids
given.  Blood, fugnal, and urine cultures sent.  He was treated
with empiric antibiotics and his weakness appeared to improve.
The patient was able to ambulate around the [**Hospital1 **] with PT and
walker assistance, but deteriorated once again, requiring ICU
admission (see below).  However, his weakness waxed and waned
thoughout the hospital course, and did not completely resolve by
the time of discharge.
