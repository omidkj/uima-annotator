History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 72-year-old gentleman with a past medical
history significant for VF arrest s/p AICD placement in [**2102**],
CHF with EF of 15%, afib, DM, COPD, HTN, and recent admission
([**6-20**] to [**7-10**]) syncope complicated by hemodynamically unstable
afib with RVR, CCU transfer, aspiration pneumonia, intubation,
and subsequent inability to take POs due to deconditioning with
D/C to rehab and readmission ([**7-11**] to [**7-12**]) after he pulled out
his PICC and was unable to receive IV medications who presents
from rehab due to unresponsiveness.
.
Notably, during his extended admission, he was found to have
severe aspirations and a subsequent aspiration pneumonia. Speech
and swallow reevalutated him multiple times with subsequent
recommendation of strict NPO. The patient refused Dobbhoff tube
placement, and requested that a [**Month/Year (2) 282**] be placed. A [**Month/Year (2) 282**] was placed
on [**2115-7-5**]. He pulled out this [**Date Range 282**] on [**2115-7-6**]. He was placed on
TPN as a bridge to another g-tube (which has not been placed yet
pending reevaluation scheduled for [**7-15**]). As stated above, he
pulled out his PICC and returned to the hospital [**7-11**]. In the
ED, he had a PICC placed, but then pulled this out so he was
given a peripheral IV and discharged to [**Hospital **] rehab MACU on
PPN.
.
Normally pt is not oriented, but he is usually able to
communicate. However, today at [**Hospital 100**] rehab MACU he was noted to
be somnolent, tachypneic, and pale. He was on tele and noted to
have several runs of NSVT. He reportedly had been up the whole
night and complained of abdominal discomfort. He otherwise
denied feeling short of breath, chest pain, palpitations. His
mental status deteriorated and he became much less responsive.
.
In the ED, patient was unable to give a history. On exam the
patient was dry with course rhonchi bilaterally. He was
intubated for airway protection and started on fentanyl/versed.
EKG: showed native left bundle with intermittent pacing and he
was noted to have 8 beats of NSVT. He would [**Last Name (un) 25177**] have
bradycardia to the 30s before his pacer would start pacing.
Cardiology was consulted for ST elevations? and they felt his
EKG was at baseline and not concerning. The patient was given
lidocaine bolus for non sustained vtach. He had a head CT which
showed "No evidence of acute intracranial abnormalities, but air
in the masticator spaces." CXR showed R PNA so he was given vanc
and levofloxacin. UA was negative. Abd CT showed distended
gallbladder and bilateral pleural effusions. RUQ U/S showed
distended gallbladder with thickened wall and sludge, concerning
for acute cholecystitis. Surgery was consulted but had not yet
seen pt in ED. He was ordered for zosyn.
.
On the floor, pt is sedated and intubated. Hemodynamically
stable.

1.9 mCi Tc-99m DISIDA ([**2115-7-15**]);
HISTORY: 82 year old male with abdominal pain.

INTERPRETATION: Serial images over the abdomen show uptake of
tracer into the
hepatic parenchyma. Tracer activity is noted in the small bowel
at 23 minutes.
The gallbladder is not visualized at 60 minutes. 60 minutes
following morphine
administration, there is faint uptake lateral to the common bile
duct, which is
atypical for but could represent evidence of partial delayed
gallbladder
uptake.

IMPRESSION: Abnormal study, without definite visualization of
gallbladder.
Although this cpuld be due to the prolonged fasting status,
acute or chronic
cholecystitis cannot be excluded.

Unilateral Upper Ext Vein
FINDINGS: Occlusive thrombus is present within the right
axillary vein,
extending to the mid and proximal portions of one of the
brachial veins. A
venous catheter traverses this region, eventually exiting that
brachial vein
into a superficial branch. The right IJ, second brachial vein,
cephalic vein,
basilic vein, and subclavian vein are patent. No fluid
collections are
present.

IMPRESSION: Occlusive thrombus within the right axillary vein
and one of two
brachial veins (the one containing a venous catheter). These
findings were
discussed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 12933**] at 1:20 p.m. on [**2115-7-14**].

The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.


Abd U/S
INDICATION: 72-year-old man with abdominal pain, NPO. Assess for
acute
cholecystitis.

COMPARISON: Abdominal CT performed earlier in the day and CTA
abdomen of
[**2115-7-7**] and a portable abdominal ultrasound of [**7-6**], [**2114**].

FINDINGS: The gallbladder is markedly distended containing a
large amount of
echogenic sludge. Areas of the sludge appear mass-like and may
be consistent
with tumefactive sludge. The gallbladder wall is thickened,
though this may
be due to known heart failure. There is no intra- or
extra-hepatic biliary
dilation. The common bile duct is normal measuring up to 6 mm in
diameter.
