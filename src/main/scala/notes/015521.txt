Service:  NEURO

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 87-year-old
right-handed woman who was found with a right-sided
hemiparesis and aphasia at 15:30 on the day of admission.
The Emergency Room evaluation showed no bleeding on head CT,
but the patient had no movement of the right upper extremity,
minimal movement in the right lower extremity, was aphasic,
seemed to have a right hemianopsia as well, and was not
following non-midline commands.  She was taken to MRI, and it
showed evidence of restricted diffusion in the left insular
cortex and left frontal lobe with a small area of restricted
diffusion also seen in the left basal ganglia region
involving the body of the left caudate nucleus.

On susceptibility weighted images, the small area of
susceptibility-related low signal was identified in the
sylvian fissure on the left, indicating blood clot within the M3
segment of the middle cerebral artery. No evidence of hemorrhage
is identified. The patient was given TPA from 19:30 to 20:00 and
was then admitted to the Intensive Care Unit.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Hypertension.
2.  Chronic low back pain; has been seen in the [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 1193**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1194**]
Clinic.
3.  Bilateral hip fractures.

MEDICATIONS AT HOME:
1.  Fentanyl Patch.
2.  Ativan q. h.s.
3.  Percocet.
4.  Oxycodone.
5.  Colace.
6.  Atenolol.
7.  Diovan.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient has a home health aide.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Noncontributory.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient's blood pressure is
154/70, heart rate 50s to 60s, afebrile, O2 sat 100%.  Her
general medical exam is unremarkable.  Mental status:  Awake,
eyes open, does not talk, nods some but not appropriately to
questions, no repetition, no speech, does not follow
commands.  Cranial nerves:  There is a right facial droop,
left gaze preference.  Pupils equal, round, and reactive to
light.  Motor exam shows left side at full strength; right
side upper extremities and no movement in the right upper or
lower extremity except deltoids and triceps [**1-15**].  Sensation
localizes to noxious stimuli in the right lower extremity and
left upper and lower extremity.  No withdrawal on the right
upper extremity to painful stimuli; only grimace on face.
Deep tendon reflexes increased on the right, decreased on the
left.

LABORATORY DATA AND STUDIES:  Chest x-ray on [**2200-12-8**]
showed bilateral pleural effusions with possibility of
loculation at the right base, retrocardiac opacification
consistent with consolidation atelectasis.  The patient ruled
out for myocardial infarction by enzymes.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  This is an 87-year-old right-handed female
who was found down on the day of admission with a dense right
hemiparesis and aphasia who was given TPA and admitted to the
Intensive Care Unit overnight and sent out to the floor the
following day.  Her neurologic exam did not improve
significantly following the administration of the TPA.  Did
not pass the swallow evaluation and required nasogastric
tube.  She did become increasingly more awake and able to
follow a few commands but never improved much more than this.

As she was on the floor she began to develop some respiratory
distress from congestive heart failure and pneumonia.  She
was gently diuresed, which improved her somewhat, and she
also was started on antibiotics.  Her respiratory status did
improve somewhat.

Given the patient's poor prognosis and the patient's prior
wishes for no life-prolonging measures, the patient was made
comfort care on [**2200-12-8**] and was then placed on a Morphine
drip for comfort.  She, thereafter, was in no distress and
eventually expired on [**2200-12-11**] at 15:55.  The patient's
family present at the time and declined autopsy.
