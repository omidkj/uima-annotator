Chief Complaint:
chest pain for 3 days


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD)
Cardiac catheterization


History of Present Illness:
This is a 48 yo F with history of HTN who is transferred from
OSH for 'stuttering' chest pain.  The pain occurred initially
with exertion and then at rest today.  It's [**10-9**] out of 10,
mid-chest pressure that radiates to bilateral arms/shoulders and
back.
.
She arrived at [**Hospital3 **] this am c/o [**9-8**] exertional chest
pain over past several days.  She received ASA 162 mg po by EMS.
 Pain was initially relieved with NTG sl x 3, Morphine 2mg IV,
and lopressor 5mg IV.  Pain returned with reported inferior st
elevation, she then received IV NTG 10 mcg, Morphine 2 mg IV,
lopressor 5mg IV.  She was started on heparin gtt with a bolus,
now 1180 unit/hr. pain free at time of transport with EKG
normalized.

In our ED, her OSH CTA was reviewed by Radiology and no
dissection or PE was found.  She was continued on heparin gtt.
She was given plavix 600 mg and started on a nitro and
integrillin gtt.  Cardiology was consulted with plan for
catheterization on Friday.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 1001**] a is a 48-year-old woman with a history of
hypertension who presented with 3 days of chest pain associated
with EKG changes and positive troponin. Her brief hospital
course by active problem is as follows:
.
1. STEMI. Although on admission there were no clear EKG changes,
an EKG on the morning of [**12-23**] showed dynamic T wave changes
consistent with transmural infarct. Her CK peaked at 774, and
Troponin T peaked at 1.30. On admission ([**12-21**]), she was stable
and CP free without EKG changes, and so cath was planned for the
following morning. However, on the morning ([**12-22**]) following her
evening transfer from OSH, she began having gross hematemesis.
She was transferred to the CCU and GI performed endoscopy (see
below). She was stabilized, and the next morning ([**12-23**]) her EKG
showed changes, so she was cathed. This revealed extensive
disease in her LAD and 4 stents were placed in this vessel. One
day later, she was called out from the CCU to the floor. She was
treated with heparin and integrillin gtt initially, but these
were stopped with the hematemesis. She was continued on aspirin,
Plavix, metoprolol, and high-dose statin. Her ACE-I was held for
2 days after the cath to prevent renal failure due to a high dye
load. She was restarted on captopril and then transitioned to
lisinopril.  She was discharged on Toprol XL.
.
2. Hematemesis. EGD on [**12-22**] revealed erosions at EG junction
consistent with [**Doctor First Name **]-[**Doctor Last Name **] tear. These were too diffuse for
BICAP. Her bleeding nonetheless stopped with PPI [**Hospital1 **] and
carafate. Her Hct dropped only 3 points, and she had no further
bleeding. She required no transfusion.  SHe was discharged on a
daily PPI, to be followed up with PCP.
.
3. CHF. She developed failure during this admission, but was
diuresed with significant improvement in her symptoms and chest
x-ray. Echo on [**12-24**] showed an estimated EF of 50%. She was
given beta-blocker and ACE-I as above.
.
4. Fever. She spiked a fever to 101.1F on the night before her
expected discharge, delaying it by several days. Urinalysis was
clean, chest x-ray was clear. Blood cultures were pending. WHen
she spiked a fever again on [**12-26**], her sputum grew GPC; she was
started on a 7 day course of levofloxacin for bronchitits /
bronchioloitis.
.
5. Hypertension. This was well-controlled with amlodipine,
metoprolol, and later captopril / lisinopril.
.
6. Physical therapy saw the patient and cleared her to go home
without any services.
