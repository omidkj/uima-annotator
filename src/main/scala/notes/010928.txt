History of Present Illness:
61F spanish speaking presented to [**Hospital3 **] after having
epigastric pain followed by an episode of large-volume melena
and one episode of hematemesis after which she briefly lost

She was in her USOH before the belly pain on Monday, and had
actually (subjectively) gained weight in recent weeks/months.
Patient had been taking 1200 mg motrin qhs for "tendonitis" for
which she had had surgery.

At the OSH her hematocrit dropped from 35 on arrival to 31 with
active bleeding seen from the NG tube and she was transfused 2
units of pRBCs. An EGD showed grade [**2-24**] varices without evidence
of active bleeding but also showed a "large tangled mass" which
was concerning for either varices or tumor. She received a 3rd
unit of rPRBCs for an HCT today of 30.6. She was started on
octreotide and protonix drips. On the morning of transfer she
remained afebrile, was in sinus tachycardia, had SBPs 130s-150s
and was saturating 100% on room air.

Per OSH discharge summary she was: s/p GIB with new onset
esophageal varices and vascular mass versus tumor in the gastric
cardia.

3. Imaging/diagnostics:
- EGD: Varices at the middle third of the esophagus, lower third
of the esophagus and gastroesophageal junction. Varices at the
fundus. Friability, erythema, congestion and mosaic appearance
in the stomach compatible with portal gastropathy. Ulcer in the
pylorus. Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum
.
- Echocardiogram: The left atrium is moderately dilated. The
right atrium is moderately dilated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses and cavity size are normal. Regional left
ventricular wall motion is normal. Left ventricular systolic
function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%). There is no ventricular
septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The diameters of aorta at the sinus,
ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
.
- Abdominal ultrasound with Doppler: Lobulated and coarsened
liver, suggestive of fibrosis/cirrhosis. No focal hepatic
lesions. Normal Doppler evaluation.
.
- Wrist X-ray: No evidence of acute fracture or dislocation.
.
- Liver biopsy: not available at the time of discharge.


Brief Hospital Course:
61F PMH of CHF and [**Hospital **] transfer from OSH for UGIB with unclear
findings on EGD.

# UGIB: Hct stable throughout hospitalization. EGD showed
varices in the esophagus and gastroesophageal junction that were
not amendable to banding. Patient placed on octreotide and
pantoprazole drips and then stopped after Hct remained stable.
TIPS was placed without complications. Post-TIPS pressure
gradient 7 mmgHg.
.
# Cirrhosis: Patient had no previous history of cirrhosis.
Workup included viral hepatitis serologies, which were negative.
[**Doctor First Name **] mildly postive at 1:40 dilution. anti-SMA mildly positive at
1:20 dilution. Iron studies unremarkable. RUQ u/s with doppler
showed cirrhosis with patent portal veins. No history of alcohol
use, however, has family history of death from cirrhosis. Biopsy
performed which is still pending. This will be followed up in
clinic on [**12-21**].

# Diabetes: on glipizide (5mgh PO daily) at home. Held oral
hypoglycemics in setting of acute illness and managed with an
insulin sliding scale.
.
# HTN: Home regimen of metoprolol 100mg [**Hospital1 **], HCTZ 12.5 daily,
Cozaar 50 daily. Currently low-to-normal BPs with SBPs ranging
100s-120s off home regimen.
.
# Asthma: mild chronic, rarely uses inhalers, no wheeze on exam.
Treated with albuterol/ipratropium nebulizers.
