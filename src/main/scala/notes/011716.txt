Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was originally admitted to the hepatology service.
She was confused on admission. She remained on lactulose and
rifaximin. A diagnostic paracentesis in the ED was done with
cell count showing a WBC of 6950 and cultures were sent. She was
made NPO. She received intermittent fentanyl for abd
pain.Vanc/cefepime/levo/flagyl were continued. Blood, urine, and
peritoneal cultures were sent. The only positive result was
yeast in her urine. She had an initial presentation of SIRS -
hypotension, increasing O2 requirements, decreasing u/o.

However, on the evening/night of [**8-6**], the patient had
hypotension unresponsive to fluids. She received over 4L of IVF
on the floor with no response in her BP. She was transferred to
the SICU and the transplant surgery service for hemodynamic
monitoring and resuscitation. In the SICU, a RIJ CVL and aline
were placed. Mental status improved during her stay in the ICU.
On [**8-8**] she required shovel mask for decreased O2 sats. Her O2
requirements improved over the week she was in the SICU. There
was concern for pneumonia for her increased O2 requirements.

On [**8-8**], the patient had increased abdominal distention. An NG
was placed.  On [**8-8**],  a 2L paracentesis was performed with WBC
of 4850.  On [**8-11**], a post-pyloric Dobhoff was placed and TF were
started: Isosource 1.5 cal. The TF were intermittently held for
nausea. On [**8-13**], she had a paracentesis with 7L tapped from her
abdomen, with 75 WBCs. Her abdominal exam improved.

Urine output was decreasing with rising creatinine. Nephrology
was consulted on [**8-8**], and felt the patient was in prerenal
failure from hypotension and did not have hepatorenal syndrome.
Renal u/s showed no hydroureter and no obstruction. She received
IV bicarb with improvement. IV Lasix was given with an
appropriate increase in u/o. On [**8-11**], the patient received a
dose of fluconazole for + yeast in her [**8-6**] urine culture. Urine
output gradually improved. On [**8-12**], all antibiotics were d/c'ed.
 On [**8-13**], the hepatology team recommended Vanco and cefepime for
pneumonia.

BP, O2 requirements, u/o, and abdominal exam improved by [**8-13**] and
she was transferred out of the SICU to be followed by the
hepatology service on [**8-14**]. She completed a course of vancomycin
and cefepime for HAP. She had developed hypernatremia towards
the end of her ICU stay and this was treated with free water
repletion with tube feeds and via IVF.

On [**8-19**] a liver donor became available and she underwent
orthotopic liver transplant with Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy,
during which she required large amounts of blood products.  See
operative report and record for full details. Surgeon was Dr.
[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 816**].  Postop, she was transferred to the SICU in stable
condition.  SICU course was uneventful, and on POD 1 the patient
was extubated.  She remained hemodynamically stable with
improving mental status and on [**8-21**] she was transferred to [**Hospital Ward Name 121**]
10 in stable condition.  Her tube feeds were restarted on POD 3.


She had two days on the regular surgical floor, but on [**8-25**] she
was noted to have a hematocrit drop to 18. An NG tube was placed
with increasingly bloody outp
