Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5790**]
Chief Complaint:
Recurrent NSCLC

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2155-9-19**]
Redo right thoracotomy and right upper lobectomy, mediastinal
lymph node dissection, bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage


History of Present Illness:
Mr [**Known lastname 112101**] is a 68M with RUL lung
adenocarcinoma found on CT done [**2154-9-2**] for chest discomfort
after banding esoph varices 8/[**2154**]. [**Year (4 digits) 112102**] was non-diagnostic.
Lesion was FDG-avid on PET (SUV 4.5) and MRI brain was negative.
He [**Year (4 digits) 1834**] bronchoscopy and mediastinoscopy which were
negative, followed by a RUL wedge resection  [**2154-12-30**] with path
returning as a 2.6 cm well to moderate differentiated mucinous
adenocarcinoma , neg nodes, clear margins. (pT1N0Mx, stage 1A).
He has had a persistent density 3.5 cm in lateral RUL since
surgery, now denser and FDG avid. His FNA ([**2155-8-12**]) was
nondiagnostic with occas groups of large atypical cells thought
to be glandular in nature or reactive. Repeat PET [**2155-4-3**]
once
again shows FDG avidity (SUV 4.8). [**First Name9 (NamePattern2) 112102**] [**2155-7-4**]
non-diagnostic.
He presents for eval for possible RUL lobectomy and discussion
with multidisciplinary team.

Pt. has had PFT's [**2155-4-30**] which show FEV1 114% and DLCO
corrected 64%. This is discordant however with clinicsl
assessment. He is short of breath walking down the [**Doctor Last Name **] and is
at
most able to climb one flight of stairs with significant
dyspnea.
No cough, chest pain, wt loss, fevers.

He has local recurrence at the site of his previous RUL staple
line. He has not been able to do the Cardiopulmonary Exercise
Stress Test due to mobility issues. PET is negative for
metastatic disease. His repeat PFT's show FEV1 of 103% and DLCO
of 50%, which is consistent with his previous PFT's done at the
time of his 1st surgery.

CXR [**2155-9-17**]
FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the
post-surgical staples
are in unchanged position.  Also unchanged is the right chest
tube.  Other
than on the previous examination, no overt pneumothorax is seen
on today's
examination.  The selective left intubation has been removed and
changed to
endotracheal tube with the tip positioned approximately 1.8 cm
above the
carina.  The contours of the right main bronchus are not
visible.  Whereas the
left lung appears normal, the post-operative right lung is
substantially
decreased in size after lobectomy and evidence of post-surgical
parenchymal
opacities.  Moderate elevation of the right hemidiaphragm.  No
larger pleural
effusion.

CXR [**2155-9-21**]
A small apical pneumothorax is present.  This was not present or
was obscured on the prior chest x-ray.  The position of the
right chest tube is unchanged.  The left lung field remains
clear.

CTA [**2155-9-23**]
CONCLUSION:

1.  Opacification of the pulmonary arteries is suboptimal.
There is no
central pulmonary embolism, but the exam is not diagnostic
distally.
2.  There is no acute aortic syndrome.
3.  Patient with recent right upper lobe lobectomy with residual
small pleural effusion and small-to-moderate pneumothorax.
Chest tube is in adequate position.
4.  Bilateral, more prominent on the left side independent
portioned
ground-glass opacities around severe emphysema is mostly
compatible with
pulmonary edema as seen in previous chest x-rays.

CXR [**2155-9-24**]
Cardiac size is top normal, accentuated by the low lung volumes.
 Widened
mediastinum is stable mainly due to mediastinal fat as seen in
prior CTs.
Mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema is unchanged.  Right apical
small
pneumothorax is stable.  Small right pleural effusion is
unchanged.  Right apical chest tube is in unchanged position.
Right hilar surgical chain is noted.  There are no new lung
abnormalities.  Skin staples are present in the right
hemithorax.

CXR [**2155-9-24**]
In comparison with study of earlier in this date, there is some
increase in the degree of right upper lung pneumothorax.
Otherwise, little change.

CXR [**2155-9-28**]
Mild interstitial edema is unchanged.  Patient has known
emphysema.  Small right pneumothorax is stable.  Small amount of
right pleural effusion is also unchanged.  Cardiac size is top
normal.  Mediastinal contours are stable.  Postoperative changes
in the right perihilar region are again noted.  There are no new
lung abnormalities.  Skin staple
