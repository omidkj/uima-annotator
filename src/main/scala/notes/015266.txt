dyspnea

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 12307**] is an 80 year-old Russian speaking woman with a
history of DM, CAD s/p CABG, dCHF, and PAF who presents with
dyspnea and is admitted to the MICU for respiratory distress.

She was recently discharged on [**2122-2-26**] after presenting with [**Last Name (un) **]
in the setting of increased lasix intake and ?AIN. She was doing
well at [**Hospital 100**] Rehab until yesterday when she was noted to be
dyspneic and lethargic with a diminshed appetite. Her symptoms
of dyspnea worsened until this morning when she was was found to
be satting 70% on room air. Lasix 40 iv was given, an ABG on
100%NRB was 7.48/37/239 at 4 p.m., and she was transferred to
the [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation.

In the ED, vital signs were initially: 98.7 101 131/81 20
100%nrb. A CXR demonstrated bilateral effusions and ?LLL
infiltrate she was placed on bipap for respiratory distress. She
was also given asa 325, lasix 40 iv, levoflox 750 mg, vanc 1 g,
cefepime 1g, and flagyl for "c.diff smelling stools." She had
two soft BMs while in the ED.

On arrival to the MICU, she is off bipap satting 100% on 5L. She
appears dyspneic with rr in the high 20s but is refusing bipap.
She denies fevers, chills, chest pain, and abdominal pain.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:
No fevers, chills, weight loss, diaphoresis, headache, visual
changes, sore throat, chest pain, shortness of breath, nausea,
vomiting, abdominal pain, constipation, diarrhea, melena,
pruritis, easy bruising, dysuria, skin changes, pruritis.


Past Medical History:
1. Coronary artery disease s/p CABG x 3 and mitral valve repair
(bioprosthetic) - post-operative course complicated by prolonged
mechanical ventilation requiring tracheostomy and PEG tube
placement, C. diff colitis, and upper GI bleed
2. History of type B thrombosed aortic dissection (seen on chest
CTA [**2122-2-23**])
3. h/o Clostridium difficile colitis
4. h/o Upper GI Bleed
5. Gallstones diagnosed 30 years prior.
6. Type II diabetes, on oral agents.
7. Hypertension.
8. Status post hysterectomy.
9. History of benign mastitis and lumpectomy.
10. History of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.
11. T11 Vertebral Compression fx ([**1-/2123**])


Social History:
Home: Russian-speaking only. Lives with husband. Had prolonged
hospitalization and rehab course after CABG and MVR in [**4-20**]. At
rehab after most recent discharge. Supportive family. Never
smoked.
Occupation: Retired physician
[**Name Initial (PRE) **]: Denies
Drugs: Denies


Family History:
No history of sudden cardiac death.

Physical Exam:
VS: 98 117/50 95 100%5L
GEN: tachypneic but able to speak in full sentences
SKIN: multiple ecchymoses over extremeties and abrasion on right
forearm and left leg
HEENT: unable to assess JVP. no cervical LAD
CHEST: diminished breath sounds, limited exam [**3-16**] stethoscope
CARDIAC: irreg, no murmurs
ABDOMEN: distended, soft, nontender
EXTREMITIES: 1+ LE edema
NEUROLOGIC: Alert and appropriate x 3. CN II-XII grossly intact.
BUE [**6-16**], and BLE [**6-16**] both proximally and distally.


Pertinent Results:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric
left ventricular hypertrophy. Right ventricular chamber size and
free wall motion are normal. The right ventricular cavity is
dilated with depressed free wall contractility. There is
abnormal septal motion/position consistent with right
ventricular pressure/volume overload. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) are mildly thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. A bioprosthetic mitral valve
prosthesis is present. The motion of the mitral valve prosthetic
leaflets appears normal. The transmitral gradient is normal for
this prosthesis. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The left
ventricular inflow pattern suggests a restrictive filling
abnormality, with elevated left atrial pressure. The tricuspid
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is moderate pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2122-9-7**],
tricuspid regurgitation gradient is now slightly lower.

FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, the
pre-existing right
upper lobe atelectasis has largely disappeared. There is
unchanged moderate cardiomegaly with signs of minimal
overhydration. No evidence of pleural effusions, no interval
appearance of focal parenchymal opacities suggesting pneumonia.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 12307**] is an 80 year-old Russian speaking woman with a
history of DM, CAD s/p CABG, dCHF, and PAF who presented with
dyspnea and was admitted to the MICU for respiratory distress.
She was called out to the floor the following day.

# Respiratory distress/hypoxia, diastolic CHF exacerbation:
Respiratory distress likely secondary dCHF exacerbation in
setting of decrease in lasix dosage after last admission. She
received Bipap in the unit initially and was weaned to nasal
canula overnight. Patient received antibiotics in the ED but
they were not continued as she was not felt to clinically have a
pneumonia.  Her CXR improved with diuresis, however, she
remained grossly volume overloaded. She continued to receive
lasix boluses on the floor.  She will continue to need high dose
lasix for several days until she becomes euvolemic, at which
point her lasix dose should be decreased to keep her euvolemic
and prevent dehydration and renal failure.  Daily attention to
her fluid status, Ins/Outs, and daily weights should be
maintained.

# Diarrhea: The patient has a history of C. difficile infections
requiring PO vancomycin.  She had diarrhea on presentation and
stool was positive for C. difficile toxin.  She was initially
started on flagyl but transitioned to PO vancomycin given her
history and should have a vancomycin taper to try to prevent
recurrence.

# Coronary artery disease s/p CABG: Had CABG in [**4-20**]. No
evidence of ischemia on this admission.  She had an
echocardiogram as there was concern she could have decreased
cardiac function and a recent MI to explain her worsening heart
failure, however, her echo was unchanged from previously.  She
was continued on aspirin and statin.  ACE inhibitor was not
started given need for blood pressure room for ongoing diuresis.
 Low dose ACE inhibitor should be considered in the future.

# Type II diabetes:  The patient
