History of Present Illness:
77 y.o female with extensive pmhx including afib not on
coumaidn, chf, ckd, mpd, hemorrhoidectomy in [**6-/2139**], lower GIB
in [**7-/2139**] s/p 19 units of pRBCs and superior rectal artery
embolization, now with recurrent lower GI bleeding.  Patient
fell at home on [**2140-1-5**] fracturing her right hip.  She underwent
total hip replacement on [**2140-1-8**] and since that time has been at
rehab.  She was started on coumadin post surgery for DVT
prophylaxis.  She has some epistaxis at [**Hospital3 **] and was
seen by ENT.  The epistaxis resolved with packing.  At rehab her
HCT was 28.8 on [**1-13**].5 on [**1-14**].6 on [**1-18**], and 27.8 on
[**1-19**].  Her rehab course was complicated by c. diff for which she
is currently taking PO vancomycin.  Four days ago she had a
bloodly bowel movement and anticoagulation was stopped.
Throughout the day today she was not feeling well and had chills
all day long.  Today at 7pm she started having large bloody
bowel movements with clots (500 cc of blood per reports).  She
did not have any abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, hematemesis.
She has been having ongoing diarreha over the past several weeks
and has been diagnosed with c. diff.  Given BRBPR, pt was
started on IVF (NS at 60 cc per hour) was sent from rehab to
[**Hospital3 **].
.
At [**Hospital3 **] patient was tachycardiac to 140, had systolic
blood pressure of 130.  Her HCT was 25.5 at [**Hospital3 4107**].
She received 2L NS and 1 unit pRBCs prior to transfer.
.
On arrival to [**Hospital1 18**], BP was 118/61, HR 132. HCT was 25.  Exam
was notable for large blood clots per rectum. Patient received
1L NS, 2 units of FFP, and started 2 units pRBCs.  ED called
gastroenterology,
surgery and interventional radidology.  Patient with iodine
contrast allergy, so IR recommended tagged RBC scan overnight
with possible angio by IR in the morning.  Patient was started
on PPI drip and received solumedrol 125 mg IV x1 as part of
pre-medication for contrast administration given allergy.
Patient spiked fever to 100.5 in the ED.  Throughout ED course
HR ranged 120s - 160s (a. fib) and systolic blood pressure
ranged 110s - 130s.  Vitals on transfer are 136 131/56 23 99%
2L.
.
On arrival to the MICU, patient continues to pass clots of
bright red blood.  She denies abdominal pain.  She complains of
pain on her back at the site of her ulcer.  No nausea, vomiting.
 She complains that she feels short of breath and has orthopnea
(pt sleeps with 6 pillows at baseline), but thinks dyspnea is
slightly worse. Pt complains of fevers and chills.

Social History:
Widowed and lives alone in [**Hospital3 4634**] in [**Location (un) 5110**], MA. In
rehab follolwing surgery for hip fracture repair on [**2140-1-8**]. 6
children and 17 grandchildren. Tobacco: [**1-8**] cig/day x 30 years,

Family History:

Physical Exam:
Vitals: T: 96.8 P: 156 P: 124/75 R: 29 O2: 91% on 3L
General: Alert & oriented x3, comfortable, tearful at times
HEENT: Sclera anicteric, pale conjunctiva, slightly dry mucus
membranes, oropharynx clear, EOMI, PERRL
Neck: supple, JVP elevated to mandible
CV: Tachy, irregular, S1, S2
Lungs: Clear to auscultation anteriorally
Abdomen: Soft, non-tender, non-distended, no rebound/guarding,
no masses
GU: foley catheter in place
Ext: warm, well perfused, left lower extremtiy shortened and
externally rotated, left calf wrapped in dressing which is
clean/dry/intact, no edema.
Neuro: CNII-XII intact


Pertinent Results:
TTE [**1-23**]: Cardiac rhythm is atrial fibrillation with an
uncontrolled ventricular rate. The left atrium is markedly
dilated. The right atrium is markedly dilated. Left ventricular
wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity is
small. LV function appears depressed due to uncontrolled
ventricular rate (the left ventricular ejection fraction during
beats following a normal diastolic filling period is normal).
There is beat-to-beat variability of the left ventricular
ejection fraction due to an irregular rhythm. The right
ventricular free wall is hypertrophied. The right ventricular
cavity is dilated with borderline normal free wall function. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is no
aortic valve stenosis. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no
mitral valve prolapse. Moderate to severe (3+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is
seen. There is severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. A
very small pericardial effusion is present (no tamponade).

Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed)
of [**2137-5-2**], the pericardial effusion is smaller. Multiple
other significant structural and functional cardiac lesions
persist as noted above.
.
Tagged RBC Scan [**1-23**]: Hemorrhage beginning at 8 minutes. Oblique
positioning limits differentiation between sigmoid and cecum
however movement of tracer is suggestive of sigmoid colon.
.
IR Procedure [**1-23**]: 1. Unremarkable selective superior and
inferior mesenteric arteriograms.
2. Specifically, no angiographic evidence of active arterial
bleeding.


Brief Hospital Course:
77 y.o female with extensive pmhx including afib recently
anticoagulated s/p L hip replacement on [**1-8**], chf, ckd, mpd,
hemorrhoidectomy in [**6-/2139**], lower GIB in [**7-/2139**] s/p superior
rectal artery embolization, now with lower GI bleeding, Cdiff
infection, UTI and hip infection.
.
# Goals of care: Pt was transferred to the ICU on [**2140-2-2**] for
worsening altered mental status. Goals of care discussion was
addressed with the family prior to transfer, and pt was made
DNR/DNI, and transferred mostly for nursing care. On the morning
of [**2140-2-3**], the ICU team continued goals of care discussion.
Based on her progressive decline, and likely irreversibility of
her multiple conditions, family meeting was held with the pt's
son on [**2140-2-3**] with [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 636**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 29286**] present. The decision was made
to focus on comfort, and pt was made CMO. Most medications,
including antibiotics, were discontinued, with only continuation
of medications for comfort, including antiemetics, pain
medications.  She was transferred back to the floor, and
remained on comfort-based medications with apparent good effect
until her passing on the evening of [**2140-2-4**].
.
The acute medical issues during her hospitalization were as
follows:
# GI Bleeding: Patient presented with massive amount of lower GI
bleeding, passing massive amount of large bright red clots.
Patient had a history of diverticular disease and known
hemorrhoidal disease as well as a lower GIB in [**2139-7-6**]
