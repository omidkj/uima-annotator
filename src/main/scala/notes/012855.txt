IMAGING:
CT SCAN Abd/Pelvis
 IMPRESSION:
1. Focal stricturing at the hepatic flexure with suggestion of
intusseception, with upstream distention of the ascending colon
and multiple loops of small bowel, findings are also concerning

2. Stranding and abnormal thickening of the appendix, measuring
10 mm in diameter, with communicating free fluid tracking along
the right paracolic gutter, concerning for ruptured
appendicitis.
3. Markedly enlarged gallbladder with stones/sludge, unchanged
in size since [**2199**].


Brief Hospital Course:
He was admitted to the Acute Care Surgery Service. He underwent
CT imaging of his abdomen revealing focal stricturing at the
hepatic flexure with suggestion of
intussusception, with upstream distention of the ascending colon
and multiple
loops of small bowel with findings concerning for obstructing
neoplasm; stranding and abnormal thickening of the appendix,
measuring 10 mm in
diameter, with communicating free fluid tracking along the right
paracolic
gutter, concerning for ruptured appendicitis and a markedly
enlarged gallbladder with stones/sludge, unchanged in size since
[**2199**]. Discussions took place between patient and his family and
the decision was made to proceed with operative management. he
was taken to the operating room on [**2203-2-15**] for an exploratory
laparotomy; right colectomy; cholecystectomy; end ileostomy and
mucous fistula. There were no operative complications.

Postoperatively he was transferred to the surgical ICU where he
remained for a several days. He remained hemodynamically stable
and was transferred to the regular nursing unit where he
progressed slowly. He developed a fever and elevated WBC on
[**2203-2-18**].  His chest xray showed some bibasilar atelectasis small
pleural effusions. He was started on Vancomycin and Zosyn for a
possible hospital acquired pneumonia.  He has remained afebrile
for 48 hours and his WBC is down to 12K.  His antibiotics will
end after the last dose on [**2203-2-23**].

His blood sugars have been in the 140 range on a diabetic diet.
His Metformin has not been renewed as his creatinine is slightly
elevated at 1.6, same as on admission. This can be reassessed at
rehab.

He was evaluated by Wound Ostomy nursing and by Physical
therapy. There have been no issues with ostomy functioning since
his surgery; his output has been adequate. Patient teaching
surrounding care of this was initiated. His diet was advanced to
regular for which he has been able to tolerate. He is being
recommended by Physical therapy for rehab stay after his acute
hospitalization.

His pathology results were consistent with stage IIA colon
adenocarcinoma. Hematology/Oncology were consulted and it was
felt that adjuvant fluorouracil- based adjuvant chemotherapy was
only recommended for patients with stage III colon
adenocarcinoma. A follow up appointment has been scheduled for
him to be seen on their outpatient clinic with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].

After a long hospital stay he was discharged on [**2203-2-22**] to
