Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4891**]
Chief Complaint:
multiple spinal metastases, concern for spinal cord compression

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
T8 vertebrectomy, T6-T10 fusion, T12 kyphoplasty

History of Present Illness:
This is a 81 yo Portugese-speaking male with a history of
prostate cancer, CHF, COPD, DM, new diagnosis of cirrhosis, who
presented to OSH on [**2192-9-5**] with agitation and back pain and who
was found to have tumor causing fracture in spine transfered her
for NSURG evaluation. The patient has been having back pain for
approximately a month. He was seen by PCP day prior to
admission. X-rays were reportedly normal and he was given pain
meds. The day of admission he then fell out of a recliner chair
and in severe pain and confused per his family. EMS was called.
A CT of the spine and a MRI were performed at OSH, which showed
a pathologic fracture at T8 and a large tumor that has almost
completley destroyed T8 vertebra with cord impingement. On
admission to OSH pt was extremely agitated and required 4 pt
restraints, code grey called, and he injured right leg against
railing. Psych was consulted and recommended antipsychotics for
delerium/agitation. Heme/Onc was also consulted for evaluation
of tumor

Neurosurgeons at OSH feel the fracture is unstable and will need
spinal surgery to stabilize, but are not comfortable preforming
biopsy/stabilization procedure. The etiology of mass is also
unknown -- so will need biopsy. Neuro exam is currently
nonfocal; motor and sensation (including normal rectal tone) are
intact. He was started on decadron on [**9-7**] with 10mg IV bolus.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1352**] recommended admision to medicine.

In regards to his other medical problems, His [**Name2 (NI) **] sugars have
been very poorly controlled on decadron, FSBS mostly 300-450s.
His agitation has improved somewhat with antipsychotics and
treatment of a UTI. Patient was being treated with bactrim for
UTI, but UCx grew enterococcus which was resistant to bactrim.

VS prior to transfer from OSH were T: 97.5 BP: 144/64 HR: 69 RR:
16 O2 Sat: 97% RA. He currently denies any pain and feels well.


(+) Per HPI and for constipation and very small amount of
dysuria.
(-) Denies fever, chills, night sweats, recent weight loss or
gain. Denies headache, sinus tenderness, rhinorrhea or
congestion. Denied cough, shortness of breath. Denied chest pain
or tightness, palpitations. Denied nausea, vomiting, diarrhea,

Foley not uncomfortable for patient. Denied arthralgias or
myalgias.

Imaging:
MR w/ and w/o contrast ([**9-9**]):
From C1-T2 level, there is no focal bony abnormality suspicious
for
bony metastasis seen. There is no evidence of intraspinal mass
seen. At
C3-4, there is disc bulging and mild narrowing of foramina. At
C4-5, disc
bulging and moderate narrowing of both foramina seen with mild
spinal stenosis and minimal extrinsic indentation on the thecal
sac.
At C5-6, disc bulging and mild-to-moderate spinal stenosis and
minimal
extrinsic indentation on the spinal cord seen with
mild-to-moderate bilateral foraminal narrowing. At C6-7, disc
bulging and mild spinal stenosis seen with indentation on the
thecal sac and minimal indentation on the anterior aspect of the
spinal cord with mild narrowing of foramina.
At C7-T1 to T3-4, mild degenerative change seen.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of bony metastasis in the cervical
region or evidence of neoplastic cord compression. Degenerative
changes predominantly from C4-5 to C6-7 with mild extrinsic
indentation on the spinal cord by disc bulging at C5-6 and C6-7.

LUMBAR SPINE:
FINDINGS: The T12 vertebra demonstrates signal changes with low
T1 and high inversion recovery signal involving the anterior
half of the vertebral body and posterior inferior quadrant of
the vertebral body with uninvolved posterior superior portion of
vertebral body and pedicles. There is mild compression of the
vertebra seen without retropulsion. In addition, there is a
focal signal abnormality in the posterior inferior portion of L1
vertebral body with low T1 and mixed low and high T2 and
inversion recovery signal. The post-gadolinium axial and
sagittal images are limited by motion, but no obvious large
epidural extension from bony metastatic lesions identified.
There are no other foci of bony metastasis seen. Degenerative
changes with
disc bulging noted from L1-2 to L5-S1 level. No evidence of
high-grade
foraminal narrowing is seen.
The distal spinal cord and paraspinal soft tissues are
unremarkable on limited evaluation on motion limited axial
images.
IMPRESSION: Infiltrative process involving the T12 and L1
vertebral bodies
with mild pathologic compression of T12 vertebra. The findings
are indicative of bony metastasis. No evidence of epidural mass
identified or high-grade thecal sac compression seen.
Degenerative changes identified.

ECHO: [**9-9**]
The left atrium is normal in size. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is
unusually small. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal
wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Left
ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%). The
aortic
