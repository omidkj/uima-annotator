HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The history between [**4-6**] and
[**4-21**], please see the prior Discharge Summary.  This
Discharge Summary covers from [**4-22**] through [**5-5**].

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was diagnosed with acute
myelogenous leukemia and underwent induction with Ara-C and
idarubicin 7+3.  His main issues were, in summary:

1.  HEMATOLOGY/ONCOLOGY:  The patient demonstrated an ablated
marrow which was expected and anticipated after undergoing
the chemotherapy.  Follow-up marrow results done to show if
there was appropriate recovery of the bone marrow were still
pending, though clinical picture suggested that the normal
cells have returned; though, the question as to whether there
are additional leukemoid cells has not yet been determined.
The patient was to follow up in about one week's time to
begin his consolidation chemotherapy which was to be done as
an outpatient by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].

The patient received multiple platelet and blood transfusions
as supportive treatment for his ablative process as
associated with his chemotherapy.

2.  INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  The patient's primary issue was that
he developed a vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecalis
infection in his blood which showed positive growth from
[**4-21**] through [**4-25**]; thus, five days.

From [**4-26**] through [**4-29**], all cultures were subsequently
negative.  The patient was treated first with linezolid and
then switched to Synercid because the enterococcus was found
to be sensitive to that antibiotic, and the concern about
linezolid was that it had myelosuppressive effects.  The
patient will undergo 14 days of therapy of Synercid, dating
from the point at which he was found to have negative blood
cultures on [**Month (only) 116**], so that he will have his last day of
Synercid (as mentioned before of 600 mg intravenously q.8h.)
on [**5-10**].

The patient was also treated with acyclovir 400 mg p.o.
t.i.d. for his herpes.  He was covered empirically with other
antibiotics as per protocol related to being neutropenic and
then having an neutropenic fever until cultures were
identified.

It should be noted that stool culture also showed
vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecalis; however, his
catheter tip remained negative.  Fungal cultures were
negative.  The patient was Clostridium difficile negative,
and he did not have any vegetations founds on his heart
valves by both transthoracic and transesophageal
echocardiograms; making us confident that he did not have
endocarditis.

The patient was followed by the Infectious Disease Service.
The fellow was Syngevony Wadwa, and the attending was [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 1439**]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 807**].

The patient also had what looked to be a tooth in his right
maxillary sinus leading to almost complete obstruction of the
(OMU) ostiomeatal unit.  The Ear/Nose/Throat Service
performed a removal of that tooth particle and drainage of
the sinus, and that was done on [**Last Name (LF) 2974**], [**5-1**], with no
complications and minimal blood loss.

2.  ENDOCRINE:  The patient has baseline Addison disease,
though he was consistently hypokalemic.  He was maintained
with prednisone and hydrocortisone throughout his admission.
For a time, he had received hydrocortisone 25 mg
intravenously q.8h.   He was then converted to
prednisone 10 mg p.o. q.a.m. and 5 mg p.o. q.p.m.   Then,
before the surgery, 100 mg intravenously q.8h., down to 50 mg
intravenously q.8h., and eventually back down to
prednisone 5 mg q.a.m. and 2.5 mg q.p.m.

The patient was keep off of his Florinef until the day before
discharge when he was started on 0.025 mg p.o. q.d. and then
discharged on his regular dose of 0.1 mg p.o. q.d.   He was
also supplemented with potassium chloride for his consistent
low potassium of 30 mEq of p.o. b.i.d.

Because he was unwilling or unable to take the potassium by
mouth during the hospital stay, he was given potassium
chloride as replacement fluids.   However, again, on
discharge, he left with the prescription of potassium
chloride 30 mEq p.o. b.i.d.

For nausea and vomiting, the patient was given Reglan and
carafate which he said did not help him particularly.  He
also was given Ativan 1 mg to 2 mg p.o. q.8h. which he was
discharged on also with his discharge medications.  He was
given a 3-day prescription of that as assistance if he were
to feel nauseated.

3.  CODE STATUS:  The patient remained full code during his
admission.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  He was discharged to the home of his
girlfriend while he recovered and was being followed for his
acute myelogenous leukemia.

DISCHARGE FOLLOWUP:  The patient was to follow up with
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on [**Last Name (LF) 2974**], [**5-8**], for evaluation and planning for
his next round of consolidation chemotherapy.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:  (The patient was discharged with a
diagnosis of)
1.  Acute myelogenous leukemia.
2.  Pulmonary embolism.
3.  Addison disease.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:  (He was discharged on the
following medications)
1.  Synercid 600 mg intravenously q.8h. (through [**5-10**]).
2.  Heparin 100 units flush through the peripherally inserted
central catheter.
3.  D-5-W flushes 5 cc through the peripherally inserted
central catheter.
4.  Florinef 0.1 mg p.o. q.d.
5.  Prednisone 5 mg p.o. q.a.m. and 2.5 mg p.o. at 4 p.m.
6.  Acyclovir 400 mg p.o. t.i.d.
7.  Potassium chloride 30 mEq p.o. b.i.d.
