[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
   59 year old woman with s/p redo, MVR, CABG, Left CEA
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
   f/u atx



Wet Read: [**First Name9 (NamePattern2) 68606**] [**Doctor First Name **] [**2155-12-25**] 8:22 PM
Bilateral basilar atelectasis is unchanged. [**Doctor Last Name **] 8:20 pm
[**2155-12-25**].


Final Report
INDICATION: 59-year-old woman status post redo of mitral valve
replacement,
CABG, and left carotid endarterectomy. Follow up atelectasis.

COMPARISON: Multiple chest radiographs, most recent of [**12-23**], [**2154**].

TECHNIQUE: PA and lateral views of the chest.

FINDINGS: Bibasilar atelectasis has not significantly changed
since prior
study. Bilateral pleural effusions remain, left greater than
right, with
perhaps small decrease in the size of both. Suture material is
seen in the
right upper lung, most likely corresponding with the prior
history of right
upper lobectomy. The heart size remains enlarged, unchanged.

IMPRESSION: No significant changes in bibasilar atelectasis.
Bilateral
pleural effusions, right greater than left, slightly decreased
since prior
study.

The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 68603**] is a very nice 59 YO woman with extensive vascular
history including CAD s/p CABG multiple PCI attempts, and
carotid artery disease with persistent chest pain referred for
cardiac catheterization. Catheterization revealed native 3VD and
occluded OM-LAD grafts. She was then referred to cardiac
surgery.
On [**12-16**] she was brought to the operating room, please see OR
report for details. In summary she had Mitral valve
replacement(mechanical)Coronary bypass grafting x3 with
saphenous vein graft to left anterior descending with jump
obtuse marginal and saphenous vein graft to posterior descending
artery and a concomitant left carotid endarterectomy. He
tolerated the operation well and was transferred to the cardiac
surgery ICU in stable condition. The patient was hemodynamically
stable in the immediate post-op peroid however several attemts
to wake and wean sedation were met with increasing hypertension
and agitation, she was therefore resedated and ventilated
throughout the operative night. Early on POD1 she was weaned
from the ventilator and extubated. Once extubated she had an
uneventful post-operative course however she stayed in the ICU
for several additional days for hemodynamic, neurologic and
pulmonary monitoring.
On POD4 she was transferred to the floor for further
post-operative care and rehabilitation. Her activity level was
advanced and medications titrated. Physical therapy evaluated
and continued to work with Mrs.[**Known lastname 68603**] throughout her admission.
Her pulmonary status remained tenuous requiring nasal cannula
oxygen 2-4 Liters with desaturations during ambulation. Diuresis
along with chest physiotherapy TID and inhalers were continued
with improvement evident. Supplemental oxygen was arranged for
home use, as she required it at home preoperatively in the past
as well. POD# 11 continued to progress and was discharged to
home. All follow up appointments were advised.
