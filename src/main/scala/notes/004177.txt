Radiology Report CTA CHEST W&W/O C&RECONS, NON-CORONARY Study
Date of [**2166-8-17**] 2:18 PM
Impression: Bilateral central pulmonary emboli with extension
into the lobar
and segmental arteries and evidence of elevated right heart
pressures.
Stranding in the pancreatic bed and porta hepatis.
Findings discussed with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 2819**] by telephone at 3:00 pm on
[**2166-8-17**].
CT of the abdomen.
Indication: necrotizing pancreatitis with elevated white cell
count

oral
contrast.
Findings: There are bilateral central pulmonary emboli, fully
described in
the CT chest report. There is straightening of the
interventricular septum
representing elevated right heart pressures.
The liver, spleen, and adrenal glands are within normal limits.
The
gallbladder is absent or contracted.
There is a percutaneous tube in the stomach. There are four
drains in the
pancreatic bed. There is a large amount of stranding in the
pancreatic bed
and porta hepatis. There is a fluid and air collection in the
region of the pancreatic head measuring 4 cm x 2.5 cm x 5 cm and
contains a drain. There is an additional right retroperitoneal
collection measuring 9.1 x 3.5 cm x 8 cm and contains a drain.
There is a midline collection of fluid and air measuring 5.3 x
2.9 cm, which appears to communicate with the more anterior
collection containing a drain. The splening vein and artery

He remained in the ICU, intubated and sedated overnight. He was
weaned and extubated on POD 1. He was transferred out to the
floor on POD 5.

He was on Imipenem and fluconazole. The Fluc was then D/C'd on
POD 4 and Vancomycin was started. Swabs from the OR grew
VIRIDANS STREPTOCOCCI. The Vanc/Imipenem were d/c'd on POD 7 and
he was started on Levofloxacin. After the PE on POD 9, he was
started on Vanc/Cipro/Flagyl. All ABX were stopped at time of
discharge.

diuresis.

FEN: He was NPO and started on trophic tubefeeds on POD 2. He
was slowly started on a PO diet. He was tolerating a diet and
his tubefeeds were cycled and weaned as he was able to tolerate
more PO's.

Post-op Hypovolemia: He received several fluid boluses for low
urine output and responded appropriately.

Post-op Hyperglycemia: [**Last Name (un) **] was consulted and helped manage
his blood sugars. He was discharged with Lantus and a sliding
scale.

Post-op PE: On POD 9. He became hypotensive, hypoxic, and
tachycardic. He was transferred to the ICU and CTA revealed
Bilateral central pulmonary emboli with extension into the lobar
and segmental arteries. Evidence of elevated right heart
pressures. He was started on Heparin and was bridged to Coumadin
amd discharged with Lovenox and Coumadin.

Vascular was consulted and he went for IVC filter placement.
