Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2777**]
Chief Complaint:
non-healing ulcer 5th toe

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Right common fem endarterectomy with stenting of right common
iliac and external iliac arteries with additional endarterectomy
of right profunda femoris artery at its origin.


History of Present Illness:
This is a 72-year-old male with a nonhealing ulceration of his

endarterectomy with placement of right common iliac artery and
right external iliac artery stents.

CXR:

IMPRESSION: Homogenous density in the right hemithorax likely
represents a
combination of fissural fluid and right lower lobe
consolidation. Another
possible explanation would be asymmetric pulmonary edema
secondary to mitral valve disease, although this is less likely.


ECHO:

Conclusions
The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is top
normal/borderline dilated. There is severe global left
ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 25 %) with mid to distal septal
and inferior akinesis. No masses or thrombi are seen in the left
ventricle. There is no ventricular septal defect. with moderate
global free wall hypokinesis. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are
mildly thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis. Trace
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could
not be determined. There is no pericardial effusion.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was taken to the operating room on [**2170-7-31**] for right
common femoral endarterectomy with common iliac, external iliac
stents and right profunda endarterectomy at its origin. The
operation proceeded without complication and he was transferred
to the floor in stable condition.

Post operatively, in the morning of POD 1, he was found to have
a wide-complex tachycardia on telemetry, becoming hypertensive
to the 160s and hypoxic requiring a non-rebreather mask. He was
intubated on the floor and then transferred to the CVICU.

Troponin pos and CKMB pos.  TTE did not show focal wall motion
abnormalities, and CXR and physical exam were not consistent
with acute systolic heart failure.  He was thought to possibly
have a peri-operative NSTEMI over simple demand ischemia, per
cardiology.  He was started on aspirin 325, a heparin drip,
low-dose metoprolol, loaded with plavix.

Pt extubated in the CVICU. It was decided that he would have a
cardiac catheter.

COMMENTS:
1. Coronary angiography in this right dominant system revealed
severe 3
vessel CAD.  The LMCA was occluded distally.  The LAD was
occluded, with
distal filling via a patent LIMA, with a diffusely diseased,
extremely
small, LAD after the anastomosis.  The LCX was occluded, with
distal
filling via a patent SVG.  The RCA was occluded proximally, with
distal
filling via a patent SVG.
2. Selective graft arteriography revealed a normal LIMA-LAD
graft.
3. Selective graft venography revealed a normal SVG-OM-rPDA
graft.  The
SVG-Diag graft was occluded at the ostium, and had a chronic
appearance.
4. Resting hemodynamics revealed elevated left-sided filling
pressures,
with LVEDP of 30 mmHg.  There was mild systemic hypertension,
with SBP
of 143 mmHg.  There was no evidence of aortic stenosis detected
by LV
pullback technique.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Severe three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Patent LIMA and SVG-OM-RPDA grafts, with chronically occluded

SVG-Diag.
3. Elevated left-sided filling pressures.
4. Mild systemic hypertension.

He tolerated the procedure well no complications.

When patient was stabalized from the NSTEMI. he was transfered
back to the VICU.

Pt troponin, CKMB down trend.

Was then transferred to the VICU for further recovery. While in
the VICU,  received monitored care. When stable was delined.
Diet was advanced.

When stabilized from the acute setting of post operative care,
was then transferred to floor status.

On the floor, remained hemodynamically stable with pain
controlled. Continues to make steady progress without any
incidents. Discharged home in stable condition.
