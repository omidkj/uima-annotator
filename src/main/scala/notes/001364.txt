positive for increased fatigue for the last three weeks.  The
patient denies fevers, chills, palpitations, chest pain,
orthopnea, shortness of breath, cough, lower extremity edema,
or leg pain.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  The patient was
afebrile, his heart rate was 82 (in atrial fibrillation), and
his respiratory rate was approximately 20.  On general
examination the patient was an obese white gentleman in no
apparent distress.  Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat
examination revealed the patient's oral mucosa was pink and
moist.  The sclerae were anicteric.  The pupils were equal,
round, and reactive to light.  Cardiovascular examination
revealed an irregular rhythm with a [**3-8**] murmur heard best at
the apex.  Respirations were even an unlabored.  The lungs
were clear to auscultation bilaterally.  Neck examination
revealed 2+ carotid pulses.  No jugular venous distention.
No bruits were noted.  Abdominal examination revealed the
abdomen was obese and softly distended.  There were
hypoactive bowel sounds.  Extremity examination revealed no
edema.

PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:  Pertinent
laboratories revealed the patient's white blood cell count
was 4.4, his hematocrit was 36.5, and his platelets were 140.
The patient's potassium was 4.2.  The patient's blood urea
nitrogen was 20.  The patient's creatinine was 1.3.  His INR
was 1.7.

PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  An electrocardiogram was done
at that time which showed the patient was in atrial
fibrillation at 93 beats per minute with a left bundle-branch
block.

CONCISE SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted
and sent for cardiac catheterization.

The cardiac catheterization revealed 3-vessel coronary artery
disease and an ejection fraction of approximately 29%.  The
3-vessel disease included the proximal left anterior
descending artery with an 80% stenosis, the left circumflex
with a 70% stenosis just after the first obtuse marginal, an
80% stenosis before LPL and the left posterior descending
artery, an 80% stenosis between the L-A and left posterior
descending artery, and a 90% stenosis of the right coronary
artery.

The patient was then referred to the Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] for
coronary artery bypass grafting.

On [**2182-12-27**], the patient underwent coronary artery
bypass grafting times two with the left internal mammary
artery to the left anterior descending artery and a saphenous
vein graft to the obtuse marginal artery.

The surgery was performed by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 53911**] and [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] (physician [**Name Initial (PRE) **]) as
assistants.  This surgery was performed under general
endotracheal anesthesia with a cardiopulmonary bypass time of
approximately 112 minutes and a cross-clamp time of 88
minutes.

The patient tolerated the procedure well and was transferred
to the Intensive Care Unit with two arterial and two
ventricular pacing wires.  The patient was placed on
dobutamine, Levophed, and propofol drips.  The patient was AV
paced at this time with a mean arterial pressure of 79.

By postoperative day one, the patient was weaned of his
dobutamine but remained on Levophed which was titrated to
correct a systolic blood pressure in the 80s.  The patient
was also restarted on his digoxin and placed on
Neo-Synephrine.

The patient continued to do well from a respiratory
standpoint and was gently weaned off his ventilatory support
and eventually extubated on [**12-29**].  This was done
without any difficulty, and the patient was placed on nasal
cannula at 4 liters and was able to maintain an oxygen
saturation of greater than 98%.

From a cardiovascular standpoint, the patient remained in
atrial fibrillation with his rate controlled between 85 and
90 beats per minute.  The Levophed was weaned off at this
time, and the Neo-Synephrine was slowly titrated down.

By postoperative day two, there was continuation of the
weaning of the patient's Neo-Synephrine.  The patient's
insulin drip was quickly weaned to off, and the patient was
started on a heparin drip due to his chronic atrial
fibrillation.  The patient remained in atrial fibrillation
with rare premature ventricular contractions noted.  In
addition, his left bundle-branch block was still prominent.
By the end of the day, the patient was completely off the
Neo-Synephrine.  The patient was started on Lasix and
achieved a moderate amount of diuresis.  The patient was out
of bed with 2-person assistance and Physical Therapy to
follow.

On postoperative day three, the patient was transferred out
of the Cardiothoracic Surgery Recovery Unit to the Surgical
floor.  The patient continued to be in atrial fibrillation
with heart rates approximately in the 90s.  The patient
continued to be on a heparin drip at 600 units per hour.  The
Foley catheter was removed on this day.

On postoperative day four, the patient experienced a moderate
amount of nausea and vomited once in the morning.  The emesis
was maroon in color with coffee-grounds appearance.  As a
result of this, the patient was seen by the Gastroenterology
Service.  The patient had a abdominal x-ray done which
demonstrated several air/fluid filled loops of bowel
suggesting early postoperative ileus.  The patient was placed
on a proton pump inhibitor and scheduled for an
esophagogastroduodenoscopy.

An esophagogastroduodenoscopy was done on [**2182-12-31**].
The esophagogastroduodenoscopy demonstrated erythema and
friability of the mucosa of the stomach with contact bleeding
noted in the fundus.  These findings were compatible with
gastritis.  The patient was advised to continue high doses of
the proton pump inhibitor.

By postoperative day five, the patient had further bouts of
nausea, vomiting, or abdominal pain.  The patient still
complained of a fair amount of diarrhea and fecal
incontinence.  The patient was tolerating his food without
any difficulty
