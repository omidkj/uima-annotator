Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4765**]
Chief Complaint:
syncope

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Endotracheal intubation.
Femoral central venous line placement.
Femoral arterial line placement.

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 86497**] is a 70-year-old man with dyslipidemia,
hypertension, diabetes, overweight, coronary artery disease,
atrial fibrillation, COPD, presenting after cardiorespiratory
arrest at home.
.
Mr [**Known lastname 86497**] felt unwell yesterday, short of breath and out of
sorts. This resolved somewhat, but today he again became even
more short of breath before collapsing at home. His daughter was
at home with him and began chest compressions after calling 911.
AED pads were placed on him en route and it his rhythm was
shocked, purportedly while in VF, although we cannot confirm. He
then became asystolic, given epinephrine, atropine,
defibrillated again twice, given amiodarone and intubated in the
field. Went to [**Hospital3 **], by which time he was in sinus
rhythm with normal blood pressure. Significant labs from that
admission include D-dimer in 2400s. Cooling commenced and he was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.
.
Upon arrival in the ED his HR was noted to be in the 80s, blood
pressure in 140s/80s. Oxygen saturation was 98%. He was having
irregular myoclonic jerks in the ED. Cooling was continued and
he was sent to the cath. lab. In the cath. lab. his right
dominant system revealed some diffuse, non-flow-limiting
disease, that did not warrant intervention (see summary of cath
findings below).
.
He was transferred to the CCU, already intubated and sedated.
Vital signs on arrival were 94.8 F, 117 BPM, 142/85 mmHg, RR 21
and 100% O2 saturation (ventilated on CMV, 22 x 500, PEEP 5,
FiO2 100%).
.
Review of systems was not possible.

only. No withdrawal to very firm nail-bed pressure. No brainstem
or spinal reflexes (no doll's eyes, blink to threat, spontaneous
eye movement, even during fundoscopy, no blink to glabella tap,
no pout, jaw jerk, biceps, brachioradialis, knee, ankle or
plantar reflexes bilaterally. Tone flacid. Bulk normal.
Myoclonus present in all limbs, but strength could not be
assessed.
SKIN: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas. Trophic
changes evident at feet/ankles.

Pertinent Results:
[**2119-4-4**]
Cardiac Cath
COMMENTS:
1. Coronary angiography in this right-dominant system
demonstrated
two-vessel disease. The LMCA was short and had no
angiographically
apparent stenosis. The LAD had minimal disease. The LCx had
serial
stenoses, with the distal lesion appearing ulcerated but without

significant stenosis. The ramus intermedius had mild disease.
The
RCA was chronically occluded proximally and filled via
left-to-right
collaterals.
2. Limited resting hemodynamics revealed normal systemic
arterial blood
pressure.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Two-vessel coronary artery disease.
.
[**2119-4-4**]
CTA Chest
IMPRESSION:
1. No pulmonary embolus.
2. Moderate cardiomegaly including left/right heart.
3. Moderate interstitial fluid edema.
4. Extensive bilateral lower lobe atelectasis/near lobar
collapse.
.
[**2119-4-4**]
Head CT
IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial hemorrhage. Extensive
periventricular white matter hypodensities which may represent
sequelae of chronic small vessel ischemic disease; however,
given patient's history, infarct cannot be excluded.
NOTE ADDED IN ATTENDING REVIEW: As above, there is no
intracranial hemorrhage. Allowing for the evidence of severe
sequelae of chronic microvascular infarction, there is no
finding to suggest acute vascular territorial infarction. There
is disproportionate 3rd and lateral ventriculomegaly, which may
represent central atrophy.
.
[**2119-4-7**]
EEG
IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal video EEG study due to severe
suppression of the background. This findings is consistent with
a severe
anoxic-ischemic encephalopathy. Note is made of rhythmic muscle
artifact
extending from the bitemporal to bifrontal regions as detailed
above but
without apparent eleptiform activity. There was no evidence of
electrographic seizures in this recording. Compared to prior 24
hours,
this study is unchanged.

Brief Hospital Course:
After completing the cooling protocol in the CCU, attempts were
made to wean the patient's sedation. When this was done,
persistent myoclonic jerking was noted without any improvement
in mental status, requiring re-sedation and, at times, even
paralysis to maintain synchrony with the ventilator. Neurology
followed the patient throughout his hospital course and, based
on the findings of early myoclonus and a markedly abnormal EEG,
felt that his chance for a meaningful neurologic recovery was
minimal. In light of this, the patient's family changed his
goals of care to be comfort only. He was extubated and expired
shortly thereafter.
.
Of note, the patient did develop a fever one day prior to death
and a CXR was suspicion for VAP. Empiric broad spectrum
antibiotics were started, but stopped when the patient became
CMO.
