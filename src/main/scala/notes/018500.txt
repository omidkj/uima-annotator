Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 10323**]
Chief Complaint:
SOB/weakness

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Thoracentesis (left side)
Thoracentesis with pigtail drains (left and right)
Pleurex catheter placement (left)


History of Present Illness:
71 F with h/o Stage II pancreatic cancer diagnosed in [**2118-6-7**]
s/p pancreatoduodemectomy and adjuvant radiation and Gemcitabine
in [**2118-10-7**] p/w SOB and generalized weakness for several days,
worse with exertion. pt is s/p IR thoracentesis on [**3-29**] w/ 2.5L
of transudative effusion removed from the right side. After
procedure went home and almost immediately began experiencing
some SOB particularly with exertion and standing which worsened
to the point where her oncologist referred her to the ED today.
Pt noted lightheadedness and extreme weakness and palpitations
when attempting to stand up with severe DOE of just several
steps. States these symptoms are similar to what she experienced
prior to pleurocentesis [**3-29**] but worse. Pt states she has been
able to keep up with PO intake despite. Denies n/v but has had
diarrhea for the last 3 weeks s/p antibiotic course w/ CTX for
E.coli bacteremia, course ending [**3-9**]. Stool is now loose for
the last week but no longer watery and never with blood. Denies
abd pain/headaches.
.
OF note, during her recent hospitalization she had a
thoracentesis. Fluid analysis showed transudate and path showed
?reactive.  mesothelial cells (from ascitic tap). PT also with
known portal vein thrombosis and at home on treatment dose
lovenox.
.
ED course:

but BP in the room was then 118/72. Did not receive IVF at that
time.
EKG: sinus rhythm at 94 bpm, no STE, low voltage diffusely

.
PT was admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**]. On arrival appeared comfortable on
3L NC with BP 110/84, 96, 98% 3LNC. Pt stated she felt fine with

Pertinent Results:
CXR [**2120-4-4**]
FINDINGS: Single portable view of the chest is compared to
previous exam from [**2120-3-29**]. When compared to prior, there
has been significant interval enlargement of bilateral pleural
effusions which are now moderate in size. Underlying airspace
disease is also possible. Superiorly, however, the lungs are
grossly clear. Cardiac silhouette is difficult to assess given
the size of effusions. Osseous and soft tissue structures are
unchanged.
IMPRESSION: Significant interval increase in the bilateral
pleural effusions since prior exam with possible underlying
airspace disease not excluded.
.
EKG [**2120-4-4**]
low voltage, SR at 90bpm no ST changes
prior ECG without such low voltage in lateral precordial leads
.
[**2120-4-15**]
CTA ABD W&W/O C & RECONS; CT PELVIS W/CONTRAST

CT OF THE ABDOMEN: The visualized heart is normal. The
pericardium
demonstrates no evidence of effusion. Small left pleural
effusion is
decreased in size compared to the most recent prior examination.
There has
been interval resolution of right-sided pleural effusion.
Bilateral pigtail drains are noted in appropriate position. A 6
mm nodule in the right lung base is present (series 2, image 1).
Additional nodularity within the right lung base measuring
approximately 10 mm (series 2, image 10) and 6 mm linear density
within the right lung base (series 2, 8) represent atelectasis
versus infectious process. Pleural-based nodularity at the left
lung base measures approximately 6 mm.

There is moderate intrahepatic bile duct dilation predominantly
involving left lobe of the liver with new pneumobilia compared
to [**2120-3-6**], which may be secondary to hepaticojejunostomy.
A 12-mm enhancing focus in the right lobe of the liver
demonstrates arterial enhancement and is isodense on the venous
phase and may represent enhancing metastasis versus perfusion
abnormality.
Hypodense area involving the right and left lobes of the liver
extending from the porta hepatis to the periphery is new since
most recent prior examination and may represent infiltrative
tumor or metastases versus perfusion abnormality.

The patient is status post pylorus-preserving Whipple with
hepaticojejunostomy. The gallbladder is surgically absent. The
remaining
pancreatic tail appears unremarkable. The spleen and bilateral
adrenal glands appear unremarkable. Both kidneys enhance and
excrete contrast symmetrically. The upper poles of bilateral
kidneys demonstrate thinned cortex similar to [**2120-3-6**] and
may represent prior ischemic injury.

Persistent thrombus of the main portal vein, right and left
portal veins, the upper portion of the superior mesenteric vein
and the splenic vein is again noted. There is mild calcification
at the origin of the celiac artery. There is minimal
irregularity of the common hepatic artery. The SMA, [**Female First Name (un) 899**] and
bilateral renal vessels appear unremarkable.

There is stranding of the mesentery which may represent edema
versus tumor
involvement. There is no evidence of pneumoperitoneum.
