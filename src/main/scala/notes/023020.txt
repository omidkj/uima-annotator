Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7881**]
Chief Complaint:
SOB

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
This is an 80 year old woman with a history of diastolic CHF,
severe AS, h/o atrial flutter, HTN and DM presenting with 1-2
days of shortness of breath and fatigue. Patient is a very poor
historian but reports that she was in her usual state of health
until the day prior to admission when she began to feel short of
breath. Her shortness of breath was even at rest. The shortness
of breath was accompanied by a cough which was productive of
whitish sputem. No fever or chills.
.
She also reports a brief episode of non-exertional central chest
pain which possibly radiated down the arms, L>R. This episode
lasted seconds to minutes and resolved spontaneously. No nausea
or vomiting.
.
On the day of admission she presented to her PCP's office where
per report she was noted to have a blood pressure of 90/52 with
a pulse of 58 and an O2 saturation recorded as 84% on 2L. Per
report she is not on oxygen at home. She was also noted to have
increased facial edema. She was sent to the ED for further
evaluation.
.
In the ED, initial VS were 97.6 64 125/42 18 100% on 12L NRB.
Labs were notable for a sodium of 115. An EKG was noted to have
new TWI in lead III. She was given 500cc NS and started on cipro
for evidence of a UTI on her UA. VS at time of transfer 74 98/76
(mostly 90s-120s) temp 96 bp 108/38 hr 72 rr 21 sat 96/2L
On arrival to the ICU she reports feeling significantly better.
She feels less short of breath and feels that her "chest
tiredness" has resolved. She reports feeling well overall.
.
On review of systems she reports bilateral peripheral edema
which she states is no worse than her baseline. She denies any
orthopnea or PND. She reports no recent illnesses, no changes in
medications and no head trauma. She denies any fevers, chills,
night sweats, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea. No recent medication
changes. No report of seizure activity or recent falls or head
trauma.


Past Medical History:

Imaging:
FINDINGS: The lateral radiograph is nearly nondiagnostic due to
respiratory
motion and body habitus. There is possible suggestion of a
pleural effusion.
The AP radiograph is suboptimal due to very low lung volumes.
There is
possible mild cephalization of pulmonary vasculature. There is
cardiomegaly.

IMPRESSION: Suboptimal evaluation, demonstrating mild vascular
cephalization and cardiomegaly, suggestive of mild congestive
heart failure
.
ECHO:
The left atrium is elongated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and global
systolic function (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size and
free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets are
severely thickened/deformed. There is critical aortic valve
stenosis (valve area <0.8cm2). Mild to moderate ([**1-1**]+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The estimated
pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is an
anterior space which most likely represents a prominent fat pad.


Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable
for review) of [**2168-3-31**], the severity of aortic stenosis has
progressed and is now critical. The severity of aortic
regurgitation has increased.The estimated pulmonary artery
pressures are lower (but may be underestimated).

Brief Hospital Course:
80 year old woman with diastolic CHF and severe AS presenting
with 2 days of increased somnolence found to have sodium of 115.
Per family started metolazone at [**Holiday **] and since then had
progressive weight gain, orthopnea and PND. There was evidence
of peripheral edema with little evidence of LVF on CXR and exam.
Na improved after diuresis.  Na slowly improved and by [**1-5**] this
was 135. She had a repeat echo which showed worsening AS which
is now critical. She was diuresed with an IV furosemide with
good urine output. She was treated for a UTI with cipro and wa
