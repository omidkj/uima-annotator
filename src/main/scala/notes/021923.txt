History of Present Illness:
This is a 83 year old female with h/o asthma, COPD, HTN,
diastolic dysfunction, and trachobronchomalacia s/p Y stent with
recent admission for COPD and CHF exacerbations who initially
presented from rehab on [**6-26**] with worsening SOB and respiratory
failure. Noted to be more SOB that evening at rehab and
transferred to [**Hospital 882**] Hospital where SBP 189/53, HR 110, O2
sat 99-100% on NRB. Started on nitro gtt, R femoral line placed,
and intubated for ABG of 7.17/92/86. Labs notable for WBC 17.0
(67.2N, 0B), Hct 27.9, BNP 1555, Cr 1.7, CK 31, tropI 0.06 (nl <
0.10). EKG with J point elevation in V1-2 that was initially
concerning for STEMI. Transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].
.
In the ED, Tm 99.2, BP initially 178/78 which improved after 1
inch nitropaste and uptitrating nitro gtt, O2 sat 100% on AC
vent. Given ASA 325 mg X 1, cardiology called to review EKGs who
thought EKGs were unremarkable for ACS. Admitted to MICU for
further management after receiving solumedrol 125 mg IV X 1.


Past Medical History:
1.   Asthma/COPD -  Recently admitted for a flare on [**2146-3-29**] and
treated with nebulizers, steroids, and a course of azithromycin.
 Last seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1632**] in Pulmonology in [**Month (only) 547**], when he
thought she was deconditioned from her time in the hospital
although adequately medicated.  Recommended a Cardiology consult
at this time for what he believed to be significant diastolic
dysfunction secondary to long-standing hypertension.
2.   Paralyzed left hemidiaphragm s/p pericardial window
procedure, performed per old cardiology notes for recurrent
pericardial effusions.  Pericardial biopsy c/w inflammation with
no evidence of malignancy.  [**Doctor First Name **] 1:40, dsDNA and RF negative.
3.   Severe hypertension with diastolic dysfunction - Per PCP
notes typically controlled in the 160's unless patient
experiences an asthma flare when it shoots to 170's-180's.
Notably systolic pressures were in the 130's during her last
hospital admission, presumably the reason why her HCTZ and
enalapril doses were halved.  Patient is poorly compliant and
most recently has not been taking her antihypertensives due to
her ill son-in-law, unable to pick up her meds from the
pharmacy.
4.   Hyperlipidemia
5.   Chronic renal insufficiency (creatinine around 1.4).
6.   Polymyalgia rheumatica.
7.   Osteoporosis.
8.   Trigeminal neuralgia - reportedly seen by Optometry [**2146-4-26**]
and referred to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] of [**Last Name (STitle) 878**].
9.   Iron-deficient anemia
10.  Gastritis

Social History:
Ms. [**Known lastname 12129**] is a widow of many years and a mother of three. She
lives in the bottom unit of a shared home with her daughter and
son-in-law, who provide her with a large amount of care and
support. Although Ms. B is able to complete most of her ADL's,
she relies on her daughter for shopping and cooking. While she
doesn't specifically say it, her increasing dependence on her
children has taken a bit of its toll on her. This may be
partially responsible for her decreased med compliance - the
patient relies on others to go to CVS to pick up her meds. Her
daughter had the flu prior to Ms. [**Known lastname 12129**]' hospitalization, and
because of this, she was unable to pick up her medications on
time. Additionally, it sounds as if the patient doesn't leave
her house very often. She comments on how she doesn't like to
walk outside or to sit on her porch. Ms. [**Known lastname 12129**] would rather
watch television, socializing with friends infrequently.

Family History:
Diabetes mellitus in siblings and children. No bleeding or
clotting disorders. Mom with ?MI

IMAGING:

CT pelvis 6/23/08:1) No retroperitoneal hematoma or fluid in the
pelvis. Soft tissue anasarca. 2) Soft tissue density nodules
along anterior abdominal wall, probably injection sites.

CXR [**7-1**]: An ET tube and NG tube have been removed. A bronchial
stent is identified. Right- sided PICC line tip terminates in
the mid SVC. Enlargement of the cardiac silhouette persists.
There is mild leftward mediastinal shift, persistent elevation
of the left hemidiaphragm, and retrocardiac opacity likely
representing atelectasis. Consolidation cannot be excluded.
Small right- sided pleural effusion and basilar atelectasis are
unchanged.

Upper extremity U/S [**7-2**]: No evidence of DVT in the right upper
extremity. Limited evaluation of the peripheral segment of the
right brachial vein due to overlying bandage.

ECHO [**2146-7-4**]: The left atrium is elongated. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypert
