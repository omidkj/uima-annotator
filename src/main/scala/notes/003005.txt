Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3043**]
Chief Complaint:
dyspnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
71 yo F with PMH of CAD, CHF, DM, HTN, CVA who developed acute
onset SOB the night prior to admission. She additionally had an
approximate 5 minute period of chest pain with burning
sensation. During the course of the night she noted difficulty
lying flat. SOB seemed somewhat positional. The day of
presentation, she went to her PCP who then sent her to [**Hospital1 6591**]. There she was found to have elevated Troponin 0.12,
0.13. CXR was not exemplary but CTA with massive pulmonary
embolism. Given Lovenox 80 mg SC at [**2154-6-6**] at [**2161**]. Has history
of R hemorrhagic CVA in [**2148**] with resultant left hemiparesis.
Hemodynamically stable and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].
.
At [**Hospital1 18**], initial VS 97.7, 128/93, 85, 14 and 97 on unknown
oxygen. Pulmonary exam noted to be clear to auscultation
bilaterally. EKG with SR, multiple PVCs and diffuse new TWI
V2-V6 compared to [**2148**]. Labs revealed hypernatremia, low
bicarbonate to 20 and UA with pyuria and bacteria. She was not
given additional medication but IR was contact[**Name (NI) **] for potential
thrombectomy.

EKG [**6-6**]:
Normal sinus rhythm with occasional ventricular premature beats.
Low voltage in the standard leads and in the precordial leads.
Very poor R wave progression. RSR' pattern in lead V1. QRS
duration of 90 milliseconds. Non-specific ST-T wave changes
throughout the tracing. Compared to the previous tracing of
[**2148-4-25**] the patient has gone from atrial fibrillation at a rate
of 117 to normal sinus rhythm at 86 beats per minute with
occasional atrial premature beats. The T wave inversions in the
lateral leads are new. The poor R wave progression out through
V6 is new. This may be related to altered lead placement.
Consider anterior wall myocardial infarction of undetermined
age.

ECHO [**6-7**]:
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion
abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). The right ventricular
cavity is moderately dilated with moderate global free wall
hypokinesis. There is abnormal systolic septal motion/position
consistent with right ventricular pressure overload. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is a very small pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Dilated and hypokinetic right ventricle with
evidence of pressure overload. Small left ventricle with normal
global systolic function. At least mild mitral regurgitation.
Suboptimal study.

Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable
for review) of [**2148-4-9**], LV function appears to have improved.
At the same time, there is new RV dilation/dysfunction.

CXR [**6-7**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of pneumonia or congestive heart failure.
2. Diminished vascularity in lung, likely due to known large
pulmonary
embolism.

bilateral LE u/s [**6-7**]:
IMPRESSION: Partially occlusive DVT of the left common femoral
vein extending through the entire left superficial femoral vein
where it is nearly completely occlusive and into the left
popliteal vein where again it is partially occlusive. Left calf
veins cannot be seen. Right lower extremity venous structures do
not demonstrate any thrombus.


Brief Hospital Course:
# Pulmonary embolus: Pt was admitted to MICU and started on
heparin gtt.  LLE u/s positive for DVT as above.  An ECHO showed
moderate RV dilation as above.  An IVC filter was placed.  She
continued to have borderline blood pressures which were fluid
responsive, likely in part do to her right heart failure, after
transition to regular medicine unit, pt remained normotensive.
Otherwise, she remained HD stable and did not require
significant O2 supplementation. Pt was transitioned to lovenox
and then to coumadin. INR WAS 5 ON THE DAY OF DISCHARGE. Pt had
previously recieved 5mg coumadin x2 days and was held on the day
of discharge. Coumadin was held on the day of discharge. Rehab
facility will continue to adjust coumadin dose as needed. Pt has
no family history or prolonged recumbency, though clot is in
hemiparetic leg. CA screening appears to be mostly uptodate with
colonoscopy in [**2152**], mammogram in [**2151**] though she has not had a
pap recently.
-PT SCHEDULED FOR LOWER EXTREMITY ULTRASOUND ON [**2154-7-8**] FOR
CONSIDERATION OF IVC FILTER REMOVAL.
-Interventional Radiology (Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **] and [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 6989**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 6745**])
to review LENI and [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 6989**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 6745**] will call pt to arrange
for removal of IVC filter at that time.
.
# UTI: pt was noted to have a +UA and initially started on
cipro. However, pt's urine grew esbl e coli s to nitrofurantoin
but not cipro and so pt was switched to nitrofurantoin for total
course of 7 days.
.
# History of hemorrhagic stroke: Review of records indicates
conversion from ischemic to hemorrhagic stroke. Seemingly
minimal risk for recurrent bleeding approximately 6 years
post-event. Pt had been on secondary stroke ppx with plavix but
this was transitioned to coumadin.
.
# CAD/?CHF: Pt reports history of EF 10-15%, however, TTE was
repeated and showed preserved LV function (no LV systolic or
diastolic dysfunction). Metoprolol was initially held for
hypotension and then restarted prior to discharge in setting of
frequent ectopy (including one 16 beat run of NSVT) and normal
blood pressures. Pt is not on aspirin [**2-19**] allergy. Crestor was
continued.
.
# COPD: continued tiotroprium
.
# HTN: Held BBlocker initially in setting of potential HD
instability, restarted prior to discharge.
.
# Hyperlipidemia: Continued home Crestor
.
# Low bicarbonate: felt to be compensatory [**2-19**] elevated
respiratory rate and low pCO2 as pt's VENOUS pCO2 was only 36.
