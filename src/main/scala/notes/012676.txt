Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7333**]
Chief Complaint:
Transfered from OSH for IABP monitoring

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
cardiac catheterization s/p bare metal stent to proximal left
anterior descending artery at [**Hospital6 3105**]
Intra aortic balloon pump placement
Right internal jugular catheter placement


History of Present Illness:
79 M with history of CAD (s/p 2 stents to LAD in [**2151**] and [**2154**]
and DES to RCA in [**2158**]), HTN, HLD, DM2 who presented to OSH at 1
am this morning for chest pain and SOB. The pain was at 5pm
yesterday, was dull in nature, associated with dyspnea and
lasted about 4 hours. On presentation VSS, but on
non-rebreather, GCS 15. EKG showed ST depressions in precordial
leads, Trop I 2.62, CK-MB 15.2. Developed increasing SOB
overnight thought to be from worsening CHF, for which he was
given 80mg IV lasix and intubated.
He then had cardiac cath revealing proximal LAD occlusion s/p
bare metal stent. During procedure, pressures dropped to 80s
despite dopamine and IABP was placed. Wedge pressure was 20
after cath and he was given lasix 60mg IV.
.
Unable to obtain ROS since pt is intubated and sedated. He is on
assist control tidal volume 500ccs, PEEP 5, RR 18, FiO2 100%. On
dopamine 20mcg/kg/min, IABP in place inflating 1:1.

Echo [**2163-12-28**]:
The left atrium is elongated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
and cavity size are normal. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 40-45 %) with severe
hypokinesis of the mid to distal inferolateral and anterolateral
walls. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal. The number of aortic valve leaflets cannot be
determined. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened.
There is mild aortic valve stenosis (valve area 1.2-1.9cm2).
Mild to moderate ([**2-12**]+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The aortic
regurgitation jet is eccentric. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Regional left ventricular
dysfunction c/w CAD. Mild to moderate aortic regurgitation. Mild
aortic stenosis. Mild mitral regurgitation. Mild pulmonary
hypertension.

Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable
for review) of [**2156-10-12**], regional dysfunction is new. The
severity of aortic regurgitation has increased. Mild aortic
stenosis is seen. No pericardial effusion is present.
.
[**1-7**] PCXR: The right upper lobe opacity is grossly unchanged
since [**1-5**] radiograph with some additional minimal
improvement at the right upper medial portion of the lungs, but
overall there is significant improvement since [**12-28**] in
the widespread consolidations. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is
stable. The right internal jugular line tip is at the level of
mid SVC. No interval increase in pleural effusion or development
of pneumothorax is present.
