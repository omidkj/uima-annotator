Carotid Bruit: no bruits


Pertinent Results:
[**2135-5-18**] Echocardiogram:
The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal
cavity size. There is mild regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction with hypokinesis of the inferolateral wall. The
remaining segments contract normally (LVEF = 50-55 %). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is mild
aortic valve stenosis (valve area 1.2-1.9cm2). Trace aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to
acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may be
significantly UNDERestimated.] The pulmonary artery systolic
pressure could not be determined. There is no pericardial
effusion.

[**2135-5-18**] Carotid Ultrasound:
Right ICA stenosis <40%. Left ICA stenosis <40%

[**2135-5-19**] Intraop TEE:
PREBYPASS
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There
are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. There are
three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets are
moderately thickened. There is mild-moderate aortic valve
stenosis (valve area 1.4-1.6cm2 Cont Eq vs. planimetry). Mild
(1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
moderately thickened. The mitral valve shows characteristic
rheumatic deformity. There is moderate thickening of the mitral
valve chordae. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.

POST BYPASS
Patient is on phenylepherine, in sinus rhythm. Preserved
biventricular function. LVEF >55%. AI and MR unchanged and 1+.
[**Location (un) 109**] unchanged. Aortic contours intact. Remaining exam is
unchanged. All findings discussed with surgeons at time of the
exam.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 85590**] was admitted and underwent routine preoperative
evaluation which included echocardiogram which was notable for
mild aortic stenosis - see result section for further details.
Workup was otherwise unremarkable and he was cleared for
surgery. On [**5-19**], Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] performed coronary artery bypass
grafting. For surgical details, see operative note. Following
the operation, he was brought to the CVICU for invasive
monitoring. Within 24 hours, he awoke neurologically intact and
was extubated without incident.  Beta blocker was initiated and
the patient was gently diuresed toward the preoperative weight.
The patient was transferred to the telemetry floor for further
recovery.  Chest tubes and pacing wires were discontinued
without complication.  The patient was evaluated by the physical
therapy service for assistance with strength and mobility.  He
did develop rapid atrial fibrillation which converted to sinus
rhythm with increased beta blocker.  He was started on coumadin.

By the time of discharge on POD 5 the patient was ambulating
freely, the wound was healing and pain was controlled with oral
analgesics.  The patient was discharged to home in good
condition with appropriate follow up instructions.
