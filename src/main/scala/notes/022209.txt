Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was initially admitted to the Neurology service with
a working diagnosis of new stroke with concomitant stroke.  By
the third hospital day her GI symptoms had continued to worsen
and the patient had emesis with subsequent deterioration of her
pulmonary status thought most likely due to aspiration.  She was
intubated and transferred to the intensive care unit.

By the following morning, her abdomen was noted to be
increasingly distended and a general surgery consult was
requested.  An NGT was placed with return of ~400ml of feculent,
bilious fluid. Additionally, she also started to display
oliguria and had evidence of acute renal failure (rising
creatinine 0.9 -> 1.4).

[**Last Name **] problem list at this time included:
1. Bowel obstruction and hypovolemic shock
2. Ventilatory failure secondary to aspiration pneumonia
3. New stroke vs. exacerbation of seizure disorder

The remainder of the hospital course will follow by problem:

1. Bowel obstruction and hypovolemic shock
The patient was aggressively resuscitated with boluses of
isotonic fluids and addition of central venous access in
anticipation of exploratory celiotomy.  In the operating room, a
complete obstruction in the region of the hepatic flexure of the
colon was found and treated by extended right hemicolectomy to
include 2 cm segment of the terminal ileum that appeared
stenotic.  The intra- and peri-operative periods were
uncomplicated.  The patient stabilized with fluid resuscitation
including resolution of her prerenal azotemia and rising
creatinine.  A wound infection was discovered on HD#6 which was
treated with opening of the incision and twice daily wet-dry
dressing changes.  The wound is healing well and and at the time
of discharge is granulating appropriately.  It is expected to
heal by second intention. From the standpoint of her bowel she
has done well.  At the time of discharge she is tolerating a
pureed regular diet and is having daily bowel movements.

2. Ventilatory failure secondary to aspiration pneumonia
By the 3d post-operative day, the patient began to display
evidence of [**Doctor Last Name **] (acute lung injury) with pulmonary mechanics
characterized by dropping compliance.  Her ventilator strategy
was adjusted to accomodate this process including tidal volumes
~300 and rate ~30/minute.  Additionally, sputum cultures were
significant for proteus and MRSA.  Consultation from the ID team
was obtained.  Her [**Doctor Last Name **] progressed into ARDS.  Ultimately her
ventilatory condition improved with lung-protective vent
management and directed antibiotics.  This process has been the
rate limiting factor in her recovery having required 20 days to
wean from the vent.  She continues to have a supplemental oxygen
requirement as well as conscientous pulmonary toilet.

3. New stroke vs. exacerbation of seizure disorder
With the aid of the Neurology service, the patient was
maintained throughout the remainder of her stay without
additional seizure activity.  She was originally maintained on
an ativan drip to provide seizure prophylaxis.  She has now been
transitioned to her home antiepileptics.  The possibility of a
new stroke resulting in her neurologic changes was excluded by
brain imaging done early in her admission.  Her neurologic
changes are therefore thought to have been a manifestation of
her seizure disorder.
