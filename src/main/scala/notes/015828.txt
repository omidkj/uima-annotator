HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 66-year-old
gentleman status post cadaveric renal transplant in [**2146-10-1**] secondary to autoimmune glomerulonephritis who presents
with fevers and rigors.

The patient was recently discharged from [**Hospital1 346**] on [**2146-10-20**] for pneumonia,
congestive heart failure exacerbation, and gastrointestinal
bleed (on heparin), as well as transaminitis.

The patient was in his physician's office at approximately 3
p.m. on the day of admission when he developed rigors.  The
patient was being seen by his nephrologist when he developed
rigors and was sent to the Emergency Department.

one to two days of explosive stools four to five times per
day (loose/watery stools).  The patient denies any other
symptoms including cough, upper respiratory infection
symptoms, dysuria, headache, chest pain, or shortness of

fatigued recently with some increase in his lower extremity
edema.  The patient states he had some mild abdominal
cramping associated with his stools and some mild nausea in
the Emergency Department.  The patient states he has a nephew
that was recently sick with upper respiratory infection
symptoms.

In the Emergency Department, the patient received Kayexalate,
1 ampule of dextrose 50, Zofran, 10 units of insulin, and

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is in early retirement as a
computer illustrator.  He lives with his wife, and daughter,
and mother-in-law.  [**Name (NI) **] quit tobacco 25 years ago.  No
laceration use.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  The patient's physical
examination revealed his temperature was 103 degrees
Fahrenheit in the Emergency Department, his blood pressure
was 180/53, his heart rate was 67, and his oxygen saturation
was 100% on 2 liters.  In general, the patient was
well-appearing but pale.  In no acute distress.  Head, eyes,
ears, nose, and throat examination revealed the sclerae were
anicteric.  The mucous membranes were moist.  The tongue with
whitish plaques.  The cheeks were flushed.  Jugular venous
pressure was approximately 12 cm.  Cardiovascular examination
revealed a 2/6 systolic ejection murmur.  A regular rate and
rhythm.  Lung examination revealed good air movement.  The
lungs were clear to auscultation aside from bibasilar
crackles (right greater than left).  The abdomen was soft,
nontender, and nondistended.  There were positive bowel
sounds.  Extremity examination revealed 1+ pitting edema
pretibially.  There were venous stasis changes bilaterally on
the right greater than the left.  There was some increased
warmth on the right lower extremity.  The patient's left
wrist had a 3-cm X 3-cm eschar surrounded by erythema.
Neurologically, the patient was alert, awake, and oriented
times three.  The patient was conversant.  There were no
focal deficits.  Cranial nerves II through XII were intact.

PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:  Laboratories
revealed the patient's white blood cell count was 13.1 (with
64% neutrophils, 0% bands, and 27% lymphocytes), his
hematocrit was 32.2, and his platelets were 259.  Chemistry-7
revealed the patient's sodium was 139, potassium was 7.4 (on
repeat was 6.4), chloride was 107, bicarbonate was 62, blood
urea nitrogen was 3.6, creatinine baseline has ranged from 3
to 4, and his blood glucose was 160.  His calcium was 9.6,
his magnesium was 2.1, and his phosphorous was 4.  His
alanine-aminotransferase was 245 (from 26).  His aspartate
aminotransferase was 328 (from 21).  His lactate was 2.5 to
3.2; originally 6.2.

PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  A chest x-ray revealed
questionable bilateral patchy infiltrates; unchanged from
prior examination.

Electrocardiogram revealed atrial fibrillation with a right
bundle-branch block.  Peaked T waves.

CONCISE SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE BY ISSUE/SYSTEM:   The
patient was sent to the Intensive Care Unit from the
Emergency Department for treatment and evaluation given
concern for sepsis.  The patient was placed on a sepsis
protocol in the Emergency Department despite never having an
episode of hypotension.

The patient was treated in the Intensive Care Unit with
ciprofloxacin and linezolid given concern for a possible
right lower extremity cellulitis and/or pseudomonal infection
of the lung or community-acquired pneumonia.

1.  SEPSIS ISSUES:  The patient had an elevated lactate on
presentation to the Emergency Department as well as a fever
and elevated white blood cell count.

The patient never required hemodynamic support.  No clear
source of an infectious process was ever found.  Blood
cultures remained negative throughout the [**Hospital 228**] hospital
stay.  Stool cultures, given the patient's history of
explosive bowel movements, were negative as well for
Clostridium difficile, Campylobacter, Escherichia coli, and
Yersinia.  The urine cultures were also negative.

Given the patient's level of immunosuppression,
cytomegalovirus viral load as well as [**Doctor Last Name 3271**]-[**Doctor Last Name **] virus PCR
were sent.  The patient had elevated transaminases as well as
diarrhea.  Therefore, there was significant concern for
cytomegalovirus with associated colitis.  The Infectious
Disease Service was consulted for input regarding treatment.

The Infectious Disease Service was recommended the patient be
started on empiric ganciclovir treatment with induction
therapy with adjustment for his renal insufficiency.  Please
also note that his stool cultures were negative for Shigella
and Salmonella as well.

Given the patient's complaint of a sore throat on the second
hospital day as well as some red blood cells with
questionable casts seen on urine microscopy, an ASO titer was
sent for concern for a streptococcal infection.  The
patient's ASO titer was positive; indicating a likely recent
streptococcal infection.  His cytomegalovirus viral load was
not detected.  An [**Doctor Last Name 3271**]-[**Doctor Last Name **] virus IgM was also negative.

The patient's linezolid was discontinued on his second
hospital day, and his ciprofloxacin was continued until his
stool cultures returned negative for concern of bacterial
colitis.  When the cytomegalovirus viral load returned
negative, the patient's intravenous ganciclovir was
discontinued.  The patient was started on penicillin therapy
given his positive ASO ti
