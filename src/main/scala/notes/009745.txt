Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5755**]
Chief Complaint:
Change in mental status

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
endotracheal intubation and extubation
central venous catheter placement

History of Present Illness:
55 yo F with h/o CAD s/p CABG, HTN, DM2, PVD, CRI with h/o
episodes of ARF, h/o hyperkalemia BIBA due to lethary. Patient
was feeling generally unwell since discharge from [**Hospital1 18**] for
episode of ARF with Cr was 2.3 (from baseline 1.1) and K 6.8 and
LE pain [**12-26**] PVD. Per her son who has been staying with her since
her discharge she was ambulatory. He reports that 2-3 days ago
she started to become more lethargic, noted to be sleeping a
lot, falling asleep during conversation then waking up and
mumbling inconherently. Her visiting nurse suggested she seek
medical attention two days prior but patient refused to come
back to the hospital. Last night patient noted to be worsening
per her son, c/o persistent pain, more lethargic, unable to
walk, having to carry her to the bathroom and to the bedroom.
This AM when nurse came they convinced her to come to ED via
EMS. Per her son she has been eating a little, drinking water,
urinating normally. He has not noted any fevers, chills, cough,
nausea/vomiting or diarrhea.
.
In the ED, VS: 95.0 60 120/70 16 100% NRB. Given 0.4 narcan with
no response. K hemolyzed but elevated to 7.8 given
insulin/dextrose, calicum and kayexalate with improvement to
5.6. Renal consult placed, no need for urgent dialysis. Given 1
gram ceftriaxone for UTI. CPAP noninvasive ventilation
attempted. ABGs 7.24-7.26/55-64/100-200. Given Solumedrol 125 mg
x 1, Albuterol/Atrovent nebs.
.
Upon arrival to the ICU, patient off CPAP, sating 90-92% 4->2L
NC. Very difficult to arrouse, requires frequent prompting,
states she felt unwell since discharge from hospital, denies CP,
sob, denies pain.

Micro:
RPR non-reactive
Blood Cultures [**2166-8-22**]: negative
.
[**2166-8-19**]
CT head: There is no acute intracranial hemorrhage. There is no
mass effect or shift of normally midline structures. The
ventricles, sulci, and cisterns are unremarkable. The [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white
matter differentiation is preserved. Visualized paranasal
sinuses are clear. The orbits are unremarkable. No acute
fractures are identified.
.

TTE
[**2166-8-22**]: The left atrium is moderately dilated. Left ventricular
wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly
depressed (ejection fraction 40-50 percent) secondary to
hypokinesis of the basal segments of the inferior and posterior
walls. Tissue velocity imaging E/e' is elevated (>15) suggesting
increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
number of aortic valve leaflets cannot be determined. The aortic
valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is moderate
aortic valve stenosis. Mild to moderate ([**11-25**]+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial mitral
regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity
of mitral regurgitation may be significantly
UNDERestimated.] Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation
is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.

Compared with the findings of the prior report (images
unavailable for review) of [**2159-9-25**], moderate aortic
stenosis is now present.
.

[**2166-8-21**]: RIJ HD catheter placement: Uncomplicated ultrasound and
fluoroscopically guided triple lumen temporary dialysis catheter
placement via the right internal jugular vein approach with the
tip positioned in the right atrium.
.
[**2166-8-25**]: RUQ ultrasound: The study is significantly limited
secondary to patient body habitus. Limited views of the liver
show no focal lesions. The common bile duct is presumed to be
patent and measures approximately 2 mm. The polyp seen within
the gallbladder on the previous exam is not seen on today's
study. Evaluation of the main portal vein with Doppler shows
hepatopetal flow, appropriately, but there are periods of
intermittent neutral flow which could reflect portal
hypertension. There is some fluid present in Morison's pouch.


Brief Hospital Course:
In brief, the patient is a 52 year old woman with history of CAD
s/p CABG, diabetes, hypertension, morbid obesity, chronic kidney
disease (type 4 RTA), and PVD who presented with subacute change
in mental status.
.
# Decreased Mental Status: The patient presented with decreased
consciousness following a low impact fall at home.  An initial
head CT was negative for mass effect or bleeds.  The etiology of
her change in mental status was likely multifactorial secondary
to obesity hypoventilation leading to hypercapnea and hypoxia,
severe sleep deprivation from OSA, worsening renal failure, +/-
small contribution from hyperammonenia. Other diagnostic
possibilities that were negative included screen for drug
intoxication, sepsis, thyroid dysfunction, or seizure. The
patient was evaluated by the neurology service who thought the
change was likely a toxic-metabolic picture.  The endocrinology
service was consulted and ruled out thyroid disfunction.  The
patient was found to have a mildly elevated ammonia level, but
the remainder of her synthetic liver function was normal.  She
received lactulose titrated to [**11-25**] bowel movements per day.
Regarding her renal impairment, a renal consult was obtained and
initiated hemodialysis after adequate access was acheived.  The
patient will need to have a sleep study as an outpatient to
confirm the diagnosis of sleep apnea and to titrate CPAP.  In
patient attempts at CPAP were unsuccessful due to claustraphobia
once the patient was more awake.  Upon transfer to the medical
floor, the patient was awake and answering questions
appropriately.  She has had a normal mental status on the floor
off all sedating meds.
