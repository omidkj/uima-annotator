Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 695**]
Chief Complaint:
Metastatic adenocarcinoma of the
colon to the liver.


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2160-12-12**] extended right hepatic lobectomy, cholecystectomy


History of Present Illness:
Per Dr.[**Name (NI) 1369**] operative note: 71-year-
old female who underwent a right hemicolectomy with
ileocolostomy primary anastomosis performed on [**2160-7-10**], by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name (STitle) 468**] for a high-grade poorly-
differentiated adenocarcinoma of the right colon. Tumor was a
pT3, pN1, pMX. CT scan on [**2160-6-18**], demonstrated no
evidence of metastatic disease to the liver. Postoperatively,
she developed right upper quadrant abdominal pain as an
outpatient and underwent an MRI that demonstrated multiple
rim enhancing lesions in the right lobe of the liver. The
largest lesion within segment 5 measured 2.5 x 1.7 with an
additional lesion in the dome in segment 8 measuring 1.4 x
1.1 cm.  A liver biopsy on [**7-23**] demonstrated focus of
poorly-differentiated carcinoma consistent with colon
primary. She underwent a course of modified FLOX chemotherapy
that was started on [**2160-9-22**]. A follow-up CT scan on
[**11-10**] demonstrated progression of disease with a 3.7 x
3.3 cm lesion in the dome of the liver in segment 8, a
segment 5 lesion measuring 6.3 x 5.3 cm, a segment 7 lesion
measuring 4.1 x 3.7 cm and a new segment 7 lesion measuring
1.4 cm in diameter. We have discussed with her the potential
benefit of the hepatic resection for her metastatic disease.
We also discussed the risks and potential complications. She
has provided informed consent and is brought to the operating
room for right hepatic lobectomy, cholecystectomy and
intraoperative ultrasound.

Brief Hospital Course:
On [**2160-12-12**], she underwent extended right hepatic
lobectomy,cholecystectomy, and intraoperative ultrasound for
metastatic adenocarcinoma of the colon to the liver. Surgeon was
Dr. [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **] [**Initial (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. Please refer to operative report for
complete details. Operative findings revealed several large
masses in the right lobe of the liver with the lesion in the
dome of the liver in segment 8 extending into the segment 4A and
abutting the middle hepatic vein. There were no lesions in the
left lateral segment or the caudate lobe. At the completion of
the extended right
hepatic lobectomy, the lesions were completely excised. The
closest margin on the second lesion in segment 8 was 0.5 cm.
Pathology results were as follows: Right lobe liver, lobectomy
(A-I):
1. Metastatic poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma, consistent
with colonic primary origin.
2. The surgical margin is free of tumor.
II.  Gallbladder (J-L):
1. Cholesterolosis.
2.  No calculi or tumor.

Postop, she remained in the PACU overnight due to low bp and
pain control issues. She received IV fluid boluses, a neo drip
and 2 units of PRBC for a drop in hct with improvement in her
bp/hct. She remained in afib with rates in the 60-90s. Urine
output dropped but responded to lasix. Atenolol was started for
rate control with good results. She was transferred to the SICU
for monitoring/management. Neo was weaned off. She transferred
out of the SICU.

LFTs increased initially postop but trended down. Diet was
advanced slowly and tolerated. She was passing flatus.  Home
meds (except alendronate, ativan & simvastatin) were resumed
including coumadin.

The JP output was non-bilious. This was removed on [**12-17**].Foley
was removed without problems. Abdomen was non-distended, soft.
Incision was clean, dry and intact.

Pain was initially managed with iv morphine then switched to
oxycodone once tolerating pos.

She was discharged to [**Hospital 11851**] Rehab with stable vital signs,
ambulating with a [**Name6 (MD) **] and RN assist as she was functioning
below her baseline. For this, PT recommended rehab. A message
was left with her PCP's answering service (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5292**]
[**Telephone/Fax (1) 64222**]regarding patient transfer to [**Hospital1 11851**] and need
for INR/coumadin management.

A one week follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] should be scheduled.
