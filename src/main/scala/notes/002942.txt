HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a [**Age over 90 **]-year-old female
with coronary artery disease one week status post an inferior
MI on [**2178-7-1**] with three vessel disease with RCA stenting
who presents from an outside hospital for emergency PTCA.
The patient on the day of admission presented to an outside
hospital Emergency Room complaining of "abdominal tightness"
and pain between the shoulder blades similar to her symptoms
that brought her to the hospital the prior week.

The EKG showed ST elevations in the posterior lateral leads.
Integrelin was started and the patient was transferred to
[**Hospital1 18**] for emergency catheterization.

The coronary angiography revealed a right dominant system
with two vessel coronary disease.  The LMCA was normal.  The
LAD had a focal calcified 60-70% lesion in the midportion.
The circumflex total occlusion of the proximal segment with a
robust left-to-left and right-to-left collaterals filling a
large single OM.  The RCA was a dominant vessel with a widely
patent [**Hospital1 **].

Hemodynamics showed normal right and left heart filling
pressures at rest during PCI with associated hypertension,
anxiety, the PA tracing showed new large V waves with PA
systolic pressure rising to 60 mmHg.

Successful PTCA and stenting of the proximal circumflex to
distal OM1 was performed using five overlapping 2.5 mm stents
for a total [**Hospital1 **] length of approximately 80 mm.

Left femoral arteriotomy closure was performed using an 8F
Angioseal device.  The patient was transferred to the CCU for
monitoring.

1.  Hypertension.
2.  Coronary artery disease.
3.  One week status post acute MI with RCA [**Hospital1 **].

5.  Aspirin 325 q.d.
6.  Lescol 80 mg q.d.
7.  Toprol XL 25 mg q.d.
8.  Lisinopril 5 q.d.
9.  Lansoprazole 30 mg q.d.

ALLERGIES:  Penicillin leads to rash.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives alone.  Does not smoke.
Does not drink.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Vital signs:  Temperature
100.8, blood pressure 117/37, heart rate 87, respiratory rate
15, breathing 96% on 4 liters.  General:  The patient appears
younger than stated age, lying in bed, in no apparent
distress, breathing comfortably.  HEENT:  Pupils were equal,
round, and reactive to light and accommodation.  Moist mucous
membranes.  Neck:  Supple.  No JVD.  Chest:  Coarse breath
sounds bilaterally with upper airway sounds.  Cardiac:
Regular rate and rhythm.  There was a II/VI systolic murmur
at the apex.  No clicks, rubs, or gallops.  Nondisplaced
point of maximal impulse.  No JVD appreciated.  Abdomen:
Nontender, nondistended, soft with positive bowel sounds, no
hepatosplenomegaly.  Extremities:  Warm, 2+ dorsalis pedis
pulse bilaterally, 2+ pitting edema to the calves
bilaterally.  Neurologic:  Nonfocal.

LABORATORY/RADIOLOGIC DATA:  White count 9.0, hematocrit
28.8, platelets 273,000.  ABGs upon admission to the CCU 7.5,
33, 94.  Chem-7 was 130, 3.6, 95, 26, 15, 1.0, 119.

EKG showed a normal sinus rhythm at 98 beats per minute with
ST elevations in II, III, aVL of [**1-8**] mm, ST depression in V1
through V5.

Chest x-ray showed mild CHF with cardiomegaly, bilateral
small pleural effusions, patchy atelectasis in the lower
lobes.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the CCU for
monitoring both hemodynamic and on telemetry, placed on
aspirin, Plavix, fluvastatin, Lopressor (switched from Toprol
XL) b.i.d. was titrated.  Her ACE inhibitor was held given
the large dye load on [**2178-7-7**].

The patient was on aspirin, Epifubitamide, Plavix 75,
aspirin, fluvastatin 80, lisinopril 5, metoprolol 25 q.a.m.,
12.5 q.p.m.  The patient's CKs dropped nicely from 150-300.
The patient was transfused 2 units of packed red blood cells
which brought the hematocrit from 26.9 to 34.3.

On [**2178-7-8**], the venous sheaths had been pulled the
previous evening.  The patient was given 20 of Lasix to which
she diuresed nicely.  At this time, the patient was
transferred to the floor.

On the floor, the patient continued to complain of some mild
dyspepsia for which she was given Simethicone and Maalox
which alleviated her symptoms.  The patient's oxygen was
gradually weaned and on this date she was breathing at 96% on
2 liters.

Physical Therapy consult was obtained, during which time the
physical therapy goals were met.  On [**2178-7-9**], the patient
was now breathing at 95% on room air.  She was asymptomatic
with overall resolution of EKG changes and CK trending down
to 296.  Creatinine was stable at 1.3 and hematocrit stable
at 32.5.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Good.

DISCHARGE STATUS: The patient was discharged breathing at 95%
on room air, maintaining her blood pressure on a stable
medication regimen.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS: Inferoposterior myocardial infarction,
status post stents to the left circumflex artery.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Aspirin 325 p.o. q.d.
2.  Clopidogrel bisulfate 75 mg p.o. q.d.
