History of Present Illness:
81F with h/o diabetes, CHF, h/o hemorrhagic stroke, h/o AVR in
[**2124-2-20**] for aortic insufficiency? on coumadin. (gets care at
[**Hospital1 2025**]), also h/o bladder cancer.  Pt was found
"pseudounresponsive" at her NH earlier today. Daughter says she
started feeling unwell yesterday AM; vomiting blood-tinged
vomitis/hemoptysis with epigastric burning in the AM.  Yesterday
evening she was unresponsive per nursing staff.

On EMS arrival, FS was 26 and she was given glucagon with
improvement of FS to 122. On the way to [**Hospital3 10310**]
hospital, she stopped breathing, became pulseless (? has PEA vs
bradycardic arrest).  CPR was performed, was given atropine, and
multiple rounds of epi.  She was intubated. She was noted to be
posturing. Femoral line was placed. CXR reportedly showed CHF.
BP was initially 67/48 and she was started on levophed vs
dopamine with improvement in BP to 104/55. HR 114. OGT was
dropped with bright red blood on return. Hct was 36 with INR
1.9. She received 1u FFP, vit K, protonix. Had low-grade temp of
100.1, WBC 18 and was given a dose of empiric zosyn. Transferred
to [**Hospital1 18**].
.
On arrival to [**Hospital1 18**] ED, vitals were T 99.2, HR 102, BP 100/58 on
levo 0.03, RR 18, SaO2 99% on 100% FiO2. Labs were notable for
WBC 17, hct 27, INR 1.6, trop 0.26, +UA. got vanco after spiking
to 101
ordered 2u rbc.  Sedated on versed gtt and NGT to suction with
75cc bright red drainage.  CT head showed VP shunt (>20 years
old), no acute intracranial process.

NON-CONTRAST HEAD CT ([**5-11**]): A ventriculoperitoneal shunt enters
via the right frontal approach and crosses the midline
terminating in the occipital [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the left lateral ventricle.
The ventricles are barely visible suggesting over-shunting.
There is no hydrocephalus. Hypoattenuation along the catheter
tract in the right frontal lobe may be due to prior infarct or
catheter related edema. The frontal horns of the lateral
ventricle are difficult to appreciate and likely effaced. The
basal cisterns are preserved. There is extensive atherosclerotic
calcification within the vertebral arteries and carotid siphons.
No loss of [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter differentiation to suggest an acute
infarct. The visualized paranasal sinuses are clear. There is
fluid within the mastoid air cells bilaterally. The calvarium is
intact and soft tissues are normal. IMPRESSION:
Ventriculoperitoneal shunt in place terminating in the occipital
[**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the left lateral ventricle. No acute intracranial
hemorrhage. Small ventricles.
.
EEG ([**5-12**]): ROUTINE SAMPLING: Showed a slow and disorganized
pattern in the theta and delta range for the beginning of this
recording with no clear lateralized features and with bursts of
sharp waves in a generalized
distribution with bifrontal predominance and sometimes also more
focal
sharp waves in the right frontal area. Beginning at 18:00 hours,
the
background activity became very low voltage with a burst
suppression
pattern of activity with bursts of low voltage delta activity
lasting
for about one second alternating with bursts of relative
suppression of
the background for about one second. At 21:00 hours, the
background
activity started again to be a higher voltage and with more
prevalent
sharp waves although still presented a burst suppression type of

pattern. This time, there were clear sharp and slow wave
complexes seen
in the right frontal area. At 23:23, the background activity
