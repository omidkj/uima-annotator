Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 458**]
Chief Complaint:
NSTEMI

History of Present Illness:
71 yo F with PMH significant for known CAD with presumed MI [**2141**]
who was found by family this morning to be short of breath,
diaphoretic and pale. EMS was called and found her to by hypoxic
to the 70-80's and in respiratory distress - pt intubated in
field. She was brought to OSH and was found to have STE in leads
II, III, aVF. She was given ASA 325, NTG, 80mg IV lasix. VS on
presentation were 101/54, 62, RR 16, 99% on vent. Pt became
hypotensive at OSH ED and was started on dopamine gtt. She was
trasferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for emergent Cath.
On presentation to [**Hospital1 18**], pt intubated and sedated, VSS, BP
elevated w/ SBP 140's. Therefore dopamine gtt was d/ced.
Cardiac cath demonstrates 95% stenosis distal LMCA, 90% stenosis
proximal LAD w/ occluded D1 and diffuse LAD dx, 90% lesion in
LCx (non-dominant), occluded OM1 w/ r-I collaterals, RCA
dominant w/ diffuse moderate calcification - ulcerated mid
segment 80% lesion w/ TIMI III flow, distal serial 70% lesions
unchanged from prior cath, [**Female First Name (un) 899**] patent to distal abdomen.
Cardiac cath hemodynamics:

C.I. - 2.1
PCWP - 16
RA - 14
PAP - 31/20, mean 26
RV - 38/10, 13
No intervention was done, as pt thought to need CABG.
Intra-aortic balloon pump was placed, along w/ swan, and pt was
transferred to CCU.

Prior cardiac studies:
[**2142-10-12**] Cardiac catheterization:
COMMENTS:
1. Coronary angiography demonstrated a right dominant system
with
diffuse 2 vessel and branch vessel disease. The LMCA was without

flow-limiting stenoses. THe LAD was moderately diseased
diffusely with a 30% proximal stenosis. The large D1 branch had
a long 99% stenosis. The LCx was noted to have a long 99%
mid-vessel stenosis with diffuse irregular disease throughout.
The OM1 had a 50% lesion at the origin. The RCA had a 50%
proximal lesion and a 60% mid-vessel stenosis.
2. Left ventriculography demonstrated 1+ MR as well as an
estimated
LVEF 44% with apical and inferoapical hypokinesis.
3. Resting hemodynamics demonstrated an elevated PCWP of 18 mmHg
and
elevated left ventricular filling pressures (LVEDP 29 mmHg).
Systemic
pressures were also elevated with a BP 160/66 and a mean of 99
mmHg.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Two vessel and branch vessel diffuse coronary artery disease.

2. Moderate systolic and diastolic ventricular dysfunction.
.

[**2139-5-5**] ECHO: focal left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
hypokinesis of the inferior wall, normal valves, normal RV.
.
[**2146-12-11**] eccho:
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is moderately depressed, EF
30-35%. Inferior wall is akinetic and the remaining segments are
diffusely hypokinetic. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
.
[**2145-12-19**] eccho:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial septal defect or
patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline
contrast with maneuvers. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are
normal. The left ventricular cavity is mildly dilated. There is
mild to moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction
with focal akinesis/thinning of the basal half of the inferior
and inferolateral walls. The distal septum is hypokinetic. The
remaining segments contract well. No masses or thrombi are seen
in the left ventricle. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with
good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
structurally normal. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The
pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a fat
pad


Brief Hospital Course:
Assessment/Plan: Pt is a 71 yo woman with PMH CAD s/p MI, DM,
HTN, Hypercholesterolemia, + FH, who p/w inferior N-STEMI,
intubated.
.
# Cardiac:
A. inferior STEMI/NSTEMI: Pt presented to OSH intubated after
c/o SOB, diaphoresis. EKG demonstrated STE in inferior leads
(although not significant when compared to prior EKG). Cardiac
cath demonstrated diffue disease (see above) with 95% stenosis
distal L main with diffuse LAD dz, RCA with proximal ulceration
and diffuse dz. Eccho with inferior wall akinesis. No
intervention was done b/c consideration of CABG; CT surgery
after evaluation felt that her anatomy (Lmain intramyocardial)
and aortic calcifiction and h/o stroke made her a poor CABG
candidate.  She was medically managed with BB, IABP, ace
inhibitor, asprin, plavix and integrillin and was eventually
taken to high-risk intervention on fem-fem bypass on [**2145-12-16**]. She
had 2 stents placed to left main, 1 stent to circ and 1 stent to
RCA. An IABP was placed back in after the procedure. This was
complicated by pump rupture.  THe balloon pump was removed with
some transient hypotension.  CT of the abdomen was negative for
bleed. She also had a NSTEMI in this setting (CK peaked in
70's).  She is on aspirin, plavix, high-dose lipitor.  Her BP
and HR was optimized on Toprol XL 125mg daily, she was on
lisinopril which was discontinued when she went into ARF and was
changed to imdur 30mg daily, hydralazine 25mg qid.
- she has cardiology f/u this week and will have a repeat cath
in 4 months by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
- if she has any recurrent ischaemic symptoms she should be
reevaluated at [**Hospital1 18**]
- at the time of hospital discharge, she has been wihtout
significant chest pain or shortness of breath.
B. Pump: Inferior wall akinesis; LVEF 35-40%.  She had an
intraaortic balloon pump placed while she was waiting her PCI;
afterwhich she was medically managed with the following regimen:

- metoprolol xL 125mg.
- holding lisinopril [**1-13**] ARF
- imdur/hydral
- lasix 60po [**Hospital1 **]
She should be kept slightly negative (500cc-1L/d) for several
days, and then a goal of euvolemic
.
C. Rhythm: she has mainly been in normal sinus rhythm.  No
sustained ventricular arrhythmias during hospital stay.  Should
get repeat echocardiogram in [**7-23**] weeks post PCI to reassess EF.
