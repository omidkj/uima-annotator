[**2151-7-22**] Persantine MIBI: Left ventricular cavity size is normal.
Rest and stress perfusion images reveal a moderately severe,
large, reversible perfusion defect in the inferior wall
extending to the apex. A second moderate reversible perfusion
defect is seen in the inferolateral wall. Gated images reveal
moderate global hypokinesis. The calculated left ventricular
ejection fraction is 43%.

[**2151-7-23**] Cardiac Cath: 1. Selective coronary angiography of this
right dominant system revealed 3 vessel coronary artery disease.
The LMCA had no angiographically apparent flow limiting lesions.
The LAD had 90% mid vessel stenosis after a large D2. The D1 had
a proximal 90% stenosis. The D2 had a 80% stenosis. The LCX had
an 80% tubular lesion proximally. The RCA was occluded
proximally and filled via left to right collaterals.
2. Limited resting hemodynamics revealed normal systemic
pressures  and
a normal LVEDP. 3. Left ventriculography revealed an EF of 60%
with no significant mitral regurgitation. There was no
transaortic gradient upon
pullback of the catheter from the left ventricle to the aorta.

[**2151-7-26**] Echocardiogram: The left atrium is normal in size. There
is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. There is mild regional left
ventricular systolic dysfunction with inferior hypokinesis.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal left ventricular
filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size
and free wall motion are normal. The aortic root is moderately
dilated at the sinus level. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are
mildly thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Mild mitral regurgitation is seen. The left
ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation. There
is trace pericardial effusion.
