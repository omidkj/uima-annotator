History of Present Illness:
66 year old gentelman, with DM, CAD, chronic Afib, hiatal
hernia, [**Last Name (un) **] esophagus with mutliple esophageal dilatations
who had robotic prostatectomy for T1C prostate adenocarcinoma on
[**2160-9-18**] at OSH. During the surgery he lost about 150 cc blood
however post-op he became anemic and had exp-lap on [**9-20**] for
evacuation of clots and hemostatis. Post-op he developed
prolonged ileus for which NG tube placement was difficult [**1-23**]
large hiatal hernia. Ileus eventually resolved. PEG was
considered (alb 1.6), however anesthesia at OSH considered him
high risk and thought of Dobhoff. After dobhoff was placed
unsuccessfully [**10-4**], he started to have upper airway bleeding
requiring intubation. He was on lovenox for DVT prophylaxis, and
after 1 dose of coumadin for chronic Afib, INR 2.36). CXR showed
stable ARDS [**Date range (1) 79119**]. He required multiple transfusions
during his stay. His last Hct was 24.3 and received 2 units at
the time of transfer to [**Hospital1 18**]. His Last INR 1.44.
.
His plt dropped from 166 on [**9-27**] to 40 on [**10-7**]. Received plt
transfusion morning of [**10-8**] and plt was up to 62. HIT
antibodies and SRA test were sent. Heme consult at OSH thought
it was most likely due to lovenox which was stopped [**10-5**]. Also,
regarding his 4 blasts on his differentials of count, heme
consult at OSH thought it is most likely a leukomoid reaction
but could not exclude underlying hematological malignancy. they
sent [**10-8**] flow cytometry that is still pending.
.
Due to repeat bleed from his upper airway he was rebronched and
new ETT was placed.
.
Post-op he also developed pneumonia for which he was placed on
vanc, ceftaz. On [**10-6**] ID thought there is no active pneumonia
anymore, stopped tobra, and recommended completing ceftaz [**10-3**]
days. His bronch cultures from [**10-4**] are negative so far.
.
Also post-op, he had Afib with RVR that required IV dilt and
esmolol and digoxin. Lung nuclear scan did not show PE. Echo on
[**9-24**] showed EF 55%, Aortic thickening but no stenosis, mikld MR,
LAE, normal wall motion. Off dilt IV now.
.
Nutrition: on TPN for the last 4 days
came on PSV, Fio2 60%, TV 650, RR 18, PEEP 8. on propofol for
sedation.

IMAGING:
CT CHEST, ABD & PELVIS W/O CONTRAST ([**2160-10-8**])
1. Heterogeneous but widespread opacities in each lung,
predominantly of ground glass attenuation. Major differential
considerations include multifocal pneumonia, although other
processes could be considered such as heterogeneous involvement
with edema, respiratory distress syndrome or even hemorrhage in
the appropriate clinical setting.
2. Extensive left lower lobe atelectasis with mucus plugging and
hyperdense material, potentially due to aspiration of barium or
other hyperdense substance.
3. Large hiatal hernia.
4. Cholelithiasis.
5. Minimal colonic wall thickening, which can probably be
explained in the setting of widespread edema.
6. Fluid collections in the pelvis which would be compatible
with resolving hematomas.
7. Small nodule in the anterior subcutaneous fat of the right
lower quadrant, probably benign, but correlation with physical
findings and attention in follow-up is suggested.

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST ([**2160-10-8**])
1. No acute intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect . Large area
of
hypodensity in the right cerebellar hemisphere adjacent to the
remote
craniotomy, presumably prior insult; correlate with history. If
there is continued concern for parenchymal changes and acute
infarcs, MRI is more
sensitive and can be considered if not contra-indicated.
2. Left mastoid air cells -opacification from fluid/mucosal
thickening.

TTE ([**2160-10-9**])
Suboptimal image quality due to body habitus. Overally left
ventricular ejection fraction is normal, a focal wall motion
abnormality cannot be excluded. The right ventricle is not well
seen but is probably normal. No significant valvular
abnormality. Mildly elevated pulmonary artery systolic pressure.
Dilated thoracic aorta.


Brief Hospital Course:
Patient was transferred from OSH for further management of his
respiratory failure and increasing leukocytosis and blast forms.
 Upon arrival, the patient was intubated and sedated.  A bone
marrow biopsy was obtained, the final results of which remain
pending.  The preliminary read reported dysplasia with
approximately 30% blasts.

A head CT was performed that showed a large area of hypodensity
in the right cerebellar hemisphere adjacent to the remote
craniotomy (acoustic neuroma).  A MRI of the head was planned to
better evaluate the posterior fossa, however it was determined
that the patient was too unstable to leave the floor after an
episode of tachycardia and tachypneic followed by bradycardia.

The patients foley was replaced and began to drain dark bloody
urine with clots.  It flushed easily,
