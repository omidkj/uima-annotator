Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4654**]
Chief Complaint:
right sided pleuritic chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
This is a 81 yo F with h/o chronic eosinophilic lung disease,
COPD (FEV1 0.74, FEV1/FVC 72% predicted in [**5-25**]), diastolic CHF,
atrial fibrillation/atrial tachycardia, and HTN with recent
hospitalization at [**Hospital1 18**] from [**6-8**] - [**6-21**] for MSSA and
Psueodmonas RLL PNA requiring intubation, pressor support for
hypotension, L sided PTX, and C diff colitis who presents from
her nursing home with fever and increasing right sided pleuritic
chest pain. Pt describes sudden onset of lower right sided
pleuritic chest pain yesterday that was non-radiating, [**2142-9-24**].
Feels SOB at baseline and does not feel SOB is significantly
worse from baseline although she feels she is unable to take as
deep of a breath than usual. The pt also describes a chronic
cough for years that has not changed. The pt also complains of
subjective and objective fevers, up to 101 at rehab 2 days ago.
Denies diarrhea but describes some increased abdominal
distention. No nausea, vomiting, neck pain, photophobia,
increasing confusion, dysuria, urinary frequency.
.
In the ED, Tm 103.4, BP 89/42, HR 126, RR 27, O2 sat 98% RA.
Labs notable for WBC 10.5 without bands, Hct 32.2 (prior
baseline mid to upper 20s), Cr 0.9, CE neg X 1, and lactate 1.5.
EKG with sinus tachycardia and no signs of right sided heart
strain. CXR with RLL infiltrate. Chest CTA preliminarily read as
extensive right sided PE with RLL infiltrate possibly concerning
for infarcted lung. She was started on heparin gtt with bolus,
given Vancomycin 1 gm IV X 1, Cefepime 1 gm IV X 1, and
acetaminophen 1 gm po X 1. Admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for further care.
.
ROS as above. Otherwise notable for some increased fatigue.
Denies myalgias, sore throat, recent travel. Has been in rehab
for past month.

Imaging:
CXR [**2141-7-18**] 12:44:
1. Persistent left pleural effusion.
2. Right basilar opacification likely atelectasis.
3. Upper lobe lucency suggests emphysema. .
.
CTA chest [**2141-7-18**]:
1. Extensive PE on the right.
2. Airspace opacification in the right lower lobe, concerning
for pulmonary infarction, but superinfection, aspiration and/or
partial collapse cannot be excluded. Opacities at the left lung
base could be related to aspiration, atelectasis or small
infarct.
3. Multiple borderline enlarged likely reactive mediastinal
lymph nodes.
4. Emphysema.
5. Multiple bilateral calcified granuloma with several
noncalcified
micronodules.
.
LENI:
1. Nonocclusive thrombus in the right common femoral vein
extending into the greater saphenous and profunda femoris vein.
2. Left peroneal vein thrombosis.
.
ECHO: The left atrium is elongated. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. The estimated right atrial pressure
is 10-20mmHg. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size
are normal. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall
motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%). There
is no ventricular septal defect. The right ventricular cavity is
mildly dilated with normal free wall contractility. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is
not present. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild to moderate ([**2-17**]+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the
severity of mitral regurgitation may be significantly
UNDERestimated.] The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be
determined. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2140-11-4**] ,
the degree of MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] [**Doctor Last Name **] has decreased. The LV and RV look
similar.
.
CXR: Hyperlucency in the upper lobes corresponded to
the known emphysema. The opacity in the left lower lung
corresponds to a
combination of atelectasis and ground-glass opacity demonstrated
in the recent CAT scan. The ground-glass opacity could be due to
perfusion abnormality distal to the pulmonary embolism. Mild
cardiomegaly. Improvement of the atelectasis in the left lung
base. Mediastinal contours appear remarkable.

Brief Hospital Course:
81 yo F with a h/o eosinophilic lung disease, COPD, diastolic
CHF, recent admission for MSSA and pan-sensitive pseudomonas PNA
who presents with fevers and right-sided pleuritic chest pain,
found to have extensive right-sided PE and possible RLL
pneumonia on chest CT.
<br>

#)PE- The patient was admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] after being
transported to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED via EMS from her rehab facility.
She had been quite immobile at that facility and it appears that
she was not receiving DVT prophylaxis with subcutaneous heparin.
 CTA revealed large right-sided PE and LENIs revealed
significant clot burden in bilateral lower extremities.  She was
given a heparin bolus and started on a heparin drip.  She was
initially hemodynamically unstable with BP 89/42, P 126 and RR
27, however quickly improved with supplemental O2, heparin and
morphine.  She was transfered to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].  She was initially
managed with a heparin drip, and was subsequen
