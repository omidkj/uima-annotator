Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Vioxx / Compazine / Phenergan

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 398**]
Chief Complaint:
AMS/sepsis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Lumbar Puncture
Tunnel Cath Placement

History of Present Illness:
This is a 75 yo F with a history of HTN, CAD, ulcerative
colitis, ESRD nearing HD initiation, and h/o recurrent UTIs
including multiresistent organisms who is admitted from [**Hospital1 **] with hypothermia, altered mental status, sepsis.

The patient was admitted on [**2-1**] with a chief complaint of
weakness. She had been unable to ambulate and had progressive
decreased PO intake, inability to even ambulate to the bathroom.
She was initially started on ctx for a presumed UTI from
[**Date range (1) 24729**], switched to unasyn from [**Date range (1) 24730**]. On the 4th was
obtunded, bradycardic and hypothermic, and was transfered to the
ICU.

Changed abx on 4th to ceftaz, got IVF, on the 6th, went from 4L
NC to 80% FM and was intubated. CXR on [**2-9**] showed new effusions
(few CXR there). Abx - ctaz, ctx, acyclovir (concern for CNS
infection), 1x dose for tobramycin, then got one time dose of
vanc on 5th, ? linezolid at least on the day of transfer.

Of note, patient was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] from [**2139-1-5**] to [**2139-1-8**]
with mental status changes likely [**3-9**] a Klebsiella UTI treated
with a 10 day course of Ciprofloxacin. She was also admitted to
the ICU in early [**Month (only) **] with severe metabolic acidosis
requiring bicarb gtt and worsening renal failure.

On arrival, the patient is intubated, and continues to be
hypothermic to around 95 degrees. She is unresponsive, appears
to decorticate with noxious stimuli. On minimal pressor support
with levophed.

ROS: Unobtainable

- Chronic LE cellulitis - treated with bilat unaboot


Social History:
Patient married. Lives in [**Location 3915**], MA with husband; daughter
and son-in-law live on different level of same house. 2
children, 3 grandchildren. Never a smoker. Denies EtOH use. Pt

IMAGING:
CT HEAD: No acute intracranial abnormalities or hemorrhage.
Sinus fluid
level and soft tissue changes could be related to intubation but
clinical
correlation recommended.

CT NECK:
No focal fluid collection is seen in the neck. Mild stranding of
the soft fat is identified bilaterally. Degenerative changes are
seen in the  cervical spine. Opacity seen in partially
visualized right upper lung, for
which correlation with torso CT is recommended.

CT TORSO:
1. No evidence of retroperitoneal bleed.

2. Large bilateral pleural effusions with complete left lower
lobe and near
complete right lower lobe collapse. Patchy opacities in the
right upper lobe
in a bronchovascular distribution consistent with an infectious
vs
inflammatory process.

3. Findings suggestive of chronic dissection within the distal
abdominal
aorta without aneurysmal dilatation. Evaluation of the abdominal
aorta is
incomplete given lack of IV contrast administration.

4. Inferiorly oriented aneurysm of the aortic arch not fully
evaluated
without contrast administration.

5. Mildly enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes which are
nonspecific.

6. Mild coronary artery calcifications.

7. Anasarca.

8. Small amount of ascitic fluid surrounding the liver.

9. Small atrophic kidneys suggesting chronic renal insufficiency
with osseous findings suggesting renal osteodystrophy.

10. Extensive lower lumbar degenerative changes as described
above. MRI may be obtained for further evaluation as indicated.

CARDIAC ECHO:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and global
systolic function (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical
quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully
excluded. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened
but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial
mitral regurgitation is seen. Moderate [2+] tricuspid
regurgitation is seen (best appreciated on cine loop #63). There
is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
preserved global biventricular systolic function. Moderate
tricuspid regurgitation. Moderate pulmonary hypertension.
Pleural effusions.

EEG:  Read pending


Brief Hospital Course:
MICU COURSE:
Ms. [**Name13 (STitle) **] is a 75 yo F with a history of HTN, CAD, ulcerative
colitis, ESRD nearing HD initiation, and h/o recurrent UTIs
including multiresistent organisms who was transferred from
[**Hospital3 7362**] with hypothermia, altered mental status, and
suspected urosepsis.

# Sepsis: On admission, patient met SIRS criteria with
hypothermia, elevated WBC, Likely sources are sputum growing
GNR, urine culture growing pseudomonas (though less than 100,000
colonies), all at OSH. [**Last Name (un) **] stim done at OSH, >9 point increase
in cortisol level. Pt was started on Vancomycin, Zosyn and
Flagyl, vasopressors. Prior to admission pt was noted to be
responsive only to painful stimuli with some witnessed
decortication posturing. Neurology was consulted for her altered
mental status, an LP was performed which showed no sign
