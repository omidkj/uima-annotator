History of Present Illness:
66 y/o white male resident of [**Doctor Last Name **] House with a h/o Hep B and
T2DM who presented to the ED approximately 2 hours after being
discharged from [**Hospital1 18**] (recent admission [**2123-6-24**] to [**2123-6-30**] for

dizziness that was not improving. He then presented to the [**Hospital1 18**]
ED with the above complaints. He denied any LOC, CP, SOB,
diaphoresis, vomiting, or hematemesis.
.

in ED.
.
In the ED, patient stated that he felt better but some nausea

Brief Hospital Course:
MICU COURSE:
The patient is a 66 yo M recently admitted with an UGIB and was
discharged home only to return 12 hours later to the ED with
dizziness.  In the ED, the patient was hypotensive and eceived
3L NS.  His pressures increased from 90/50 to 135/70.  His hct
was stable from the time of discharge (32 -->31).  He was
admitted to the floor where he then became tacycardic and again
hypotensive.  He was thought to be re-bleeding and was
transferred to the ICU for an EGD.  Upon arrival in the ICU, he
was again stable with BP's in the 120's and HR 70's.  4 hours
later (prior to the EGD), the patient acutely dropped his
pressures to the 60's and was tachycardic to the 150's.  A hct
showed a drop from 31 --> 24.  He was transfused 5 units of PRBC
and had approximately 4L of NS. He was intubated and an EGD was
performed which showed his known gastric varice with evidence of
recent bleeding.  [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 10045**] tube was inflated and arrangements
were made for an urgent TIPS procedure.  He was taken to IR and
a TIPS was attempted but unsuccessful.  The [**Last Name (un) 10045**] tube was
deflated after 12 hours.  The patients hct again stabalized.  A
TIPS was then reattempted x 3 and was successful on third try
On HD# 6, pt spiked a temp to 101.  Sputum from ET tube grew out
4+GNR and 4+GPC.  Given his recent hospitalization, he was
broadly covered with vancomycin and zosyn.  Also, pt was noted
to be minimally responsive off sedation thought to be [**1-28**] slowed
clearance of versed by his liver.  Head CT was negative.  His
mental status was initially poor in the unit.  On HD #  Pt. was
transferred out to the floor.  He susequently developed
respiratory distress and was readmitted to the MICU for
aspiration pneumonia.  He was treated with Levoquin and Flagyl
in the unit and became afebrile.  He continued to have ascites
and paracentesis was performed in the unit.  Pt's respiratory
status improved after paracentesis.  600cc ascites fluid was
negative for SBP, and patient was prophylaxed on Rifaxamin.   He
progressively regained mental status and respiratory status and
after remaining afebrile he came back to the floor on HD# 19
with no antibiotic coverage.
Once on the floor Pt's course continued as follows.
# Respiratory Distress: Ddx included PE (pt has not been on SQ
hep [**1-28**] coagulopathy from liver dz), aspiration (tube feeds),
increasing abdominal distention leading to atelectasis and poor
inspiration, fluid overload, hepatopulm syndrome. to NC with
sats>95. CTA was not done as suspicion was low for PE due to
adequeate oxygenation. Pts breathing was much more comfortable
after paracentesis.  Pt. initially suspicious for Pulm edema.
He was diuresed with Lasix and Spirinolactone.  His respiratory
status and CXR improved with diuresis.  Pt. O2 requirement
progressed from non-rebreather to NC and by HD#26 he was
saturating 95% on RA.

# GIB: Patient with known cirrhosis and gastric varices. Recent
melanotic episodes, EGD done [**7-19**] with fundic varices but no
active bleed. Pt. continued to have + guaics on floor after GIB.
 By HD#21 Guaics were negative and nursing D/C guaic checks.  No
further episodes of GI bleeding were noted.
- PPI [**Hospital1 **]
-Successful TIPS in the unit, Nadolol not necessary per
Hepatology because of TIPS.
.
# Cirrhosis:
-Pt was followed along by hepatology during hospitalization.
His ascites was treated with Lasix and spirinolactone for
diuresis which was successful. Pt. initially had some symptoms
of encephalopathy on the floor.  He was given Lactulose titrated
to 4 BM's per day.  His Mental Status progressively improved and
he was conversant with no asterixis, A&O x 3 on HD#26.
Rifaxamin for SBP prophylaxis.
- liver lesions on ultrasound concerning for malignancy; aFP
elevated; will need liver biopsy of lesions once stable if MRI
proves that a mass is there
- Pt. coags were stable on D/C
-Pt requires MRI of Liver to determine if there is a mass
suspicious for [**Company 191**].  U/S was suspicious for Liver mass, that
requires further work-up.  Pt. declined MRI x 2
Hepatology fine for MRI to be arranged as outpatient.  Pt.
likely to require Biopsy if MRI shows liver lesion suspicious
for [**Company 191**].
.
#[**Name (NI) 3674**] Pt. Hematocrit was stable on the floor.  Because of
history of anemia, Anemia work-up was undertaken which showed no
evidence of hemolysis or Iron Deficiency.  HCT on HD #26 was
28.6

# DM: RISS
-sugars stable throughout floor stay
.
# Schizophrenia: psych following. started back on haldol 5mg [**Hospital1 **]
per psych recs; cont zydis
-added 10 mg Celexa per psych. Celexa can advance to 20 mg if
necessary.  Standing Haldol and Cogentin and Perphenazine were
added per psych recs.
