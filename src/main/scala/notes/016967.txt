Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 602**]
Chief Complaint:
Abdominal pain/ pancreatitis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Bone Marrow Biopsy


History of Present Illness:
33 year old gentleman with h/o polysubstance abuse (EtOH,
cocaine, Xanax), DM2, seizure disorder (? withdrawal), severe
depression, alcoholic pancreatitis in [**6-/2162**] admitted to OSH w/
hypertriglyceridemic pancreatitis on [**12-18**].  Initially intubated
for agitation, ? withdrawal, course complicated by respiratory
failure and development of ARDS.

The patient initially presented on [**12-18**] with report of 24 hours
of acute onset abodominal pain accompanied by nausea. While he
denied EtOH use, a close friend endorsed recent EtOH abuse.
Serum and urine tox were negative on presentation.  He denied
hematemes, BRBPR. Labs on presentation WBC 11, hct 31.2, lipase
1500, triglycerides >3600 (greater than assay), cholesterol was
over 1000 and normal LFTs. CT scan demosntrated acute
pancreatitis, with peripancreatic fluid wihtout loculated
collections in addition to a fatty liver.  The patient was seen
by GI c/s who felt sx c/w severe pancreatitis likely [**2-3**]
hypertriglyceridemia. Felt transfer to tertiary care center for
plasma exchange of triglycerides if no improvement demosntrated.


The patients hospital course was complicated by severe agitation
and question of withdrawal seizure. On HD 3 he was intubated due
to sedation for agitation/management of withdrawal.  He was
started on TPN for nutritional support and a triple lumen PICC
line was placed. He was started on gemfibrozil 600mg [**Hospital1 **].  Since
intubation serial chest xrays have demonstated worsening
bilateral infiltrates that have become diffuse in nature.  He
was initially treated with aggressive IVF.  He became febrile by
HD3, and was started on vancomycin and zosyn for empiric
anti-microbial coverage of hospital acquired pneumonia.  By HD
5, he developed worsening hypoxia, and was noted to be
asyncronous with the vent requiring high PEEPs.  His fluids were
decreased to 120cc per hour and he was given 40 of IV lasix for
concern that volume overload was contributing. 7.26/51/69 while
AC Vt 500 RR18 Fio2 of 80% and PEEP 10.  His hospital course has
further been complicated by hyponatremia which corrected with NS
boluses in addition to acute on chronic anemia.  Hemolysis labs
on HD2 were negative. He was transfused a total of 4 units of
pRBC. On HD 5, at the request of his family, transfer to [**Hospital1 18**]
was initiated.  His labs on transfer were WBC 9.6, Hct 25.9, pts
157, bands 33, Na 134, Creatinine 1.6, cholesterol 463,
triglycerides 1477.

On arrival to the ICU,  initial vitals were: 101.1; HR 120; BP
138/68; RR 18, O2 sat 96%.

IMAGING:
PORTABLE CXR [**2162-12-22**]- ETT tube ends approximately 5.7 cm above
the carina. An orogastric tube is seen coursing below the
diaphragm into the stomach; however, distal end is beyond the
radiograph view. A right PICC line terminates approximately at
the level of the lower SVC/cavoatrial junction. Bilateral lung
opacity is in the perihilar distribution suggesting moderate
pulmonary edema and presumed small left pleural effusion having
unchanged appearance since [**2162-12-22**]. Increased
retrocardiac density with obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm
margin reflecting left lower lung atelectasis is similar. Top
normal heart size, mediastinal and hilar contours are stable.
  IMPRESSION: Moderate pulmonary edema, small left pleural
effusion and left lower lung atelectasis.

LIVER US [**2162-12-22**]- The liver is diffusely echogenic but no focal
lesions are identified. There is no intra, or extrahepatic
biliary duct dilation and the CBD measures 4 mm. The gallbladder
appears normal in size without stones or sludge. Normal
hepatopetal flow is seen in the main portal vein. The
intra-abdominal IVC appears normal. The visualized head and body
of the pancreas appear enlarged and echogenic. The spleen is
enlarged measuring 18.8 cm. The right kidney measures 14.6 cm
and appears normal in echotexture without stones, masses or
hydronephrosis. The left kidney was poorly visualized measuring
approximately 14.1 cm but evaluation of the left renal
parenchyma is severely limited. A small amount of fluid is
present in the deep pelvis. A small right-sided pleural effusion
was present.
