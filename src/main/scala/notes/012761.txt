Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2159**]
Chief Complaint:
dyspnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
bronchoscopy


History of Present Illness:
26 yo M with h/o asthma now admitted for persistent dyspnea. Pt
was recently admitted to hospital in [**State 3914**] with dyspnea which
was thought to be due to asthma exacerbation. However, he did
not improve with standard therapies and a bronchoscopy was
performed which was very difficult but did not show clear
tracheobronchomalacia but did show possible vocal cord
dysfunction. (Of note, pt required extremely heavy doses of
versed and fentanyl to be able to tolerate bronch). He did seem
to improve with Bipap. He was discharged home but has continued
to have severe dyspnea. Per pt he is not able to lie flat and
continues to be tachypneic. On DOA he had an appointment with IP
at [**Hospital1 18**] for a consult given the abnormal bronch findings. He
arrived in the IP suite but was felt to be too tachypneic to
tolerate bronch. Plan is to admit to MICU overnight to start pt
on BiPAP and check ABG with future plans to bronch in next few
days. Of note, per pulmonary fellow once patient was given plan
of being admitted and was asked to wait for MICU bed he appeared
much less tachypneic and seemed comfortable with breathing.
.
Per patient his SOB began about 3 weeks ago whe he was
increasing using his albuterol inhaler.  He notes that he has
has asthma all of his life, but never been intubated.  He
outpatient doctor started him on prednisone but his SOB was so
bad that he presented to the ED in [**State 3914**].  There is was
hospitalized for and underwent 3 brochcoscopies, and CTA for PE
x2 which were negative per patient. He was discharged from OSH 3
days ago with no improvement as mentioned above.
.
Currently he feels SOB and complains of right sided pain that
radiates to his back with every inspiration. His pain is well
controlled with morphine.

Brief Hospital Course:
26 yo M with h/o asthma now with persistent dyspnea and
tachypnea wheezing and pleuritic right sided chest pain
.
# Dyspnea/Asthma: His dyspnea was related to severe asthma
exacerbation with unclear precipitant. Patient was admitted to
MICU for overnight observation and was put on BiPAP with good
response. He was given solumedrol 120 Q6, advair and albuterol
with good response. He underwent bronchoscopy on [**2137-3-29**] which
showed erythematous mucosa and no tracheobronchomalacia and
normal vocal cords. The patient had no issues in the MICU and
was transferred to medicine. On the floor the patient denied
dyspnea and was doing well on steroids. He was continued on a
steroid taper including IV methylprednisolone 80 mg IV q 6, 40
mg IV q 6 x 1 day, 20 mg IV Q6H x 1 day and then 80 mg PO daily
for discharge (with PO prednisone taper written out at end of
this summary). The patient remained stable on steroids, advair,
albuterol and accolate.  Per pulmonary, his work as mechanix may
also exacerbate his asthma as well as GERD. He was taught to use
a peak flow meter and will need to have his RAST and IGE
followed as an outpatient. He will need close follow-up by
pulmonary at discharge. It was recommended that Zolair can be
tried as an outpatient. He was also started on bactrim for PCP
prophylaxis while on high dose steroids. IGE was elevated at 192
(range 0-114) at discharge.
.
# back pain: The patient had paraspinal back pain with no
spinous tenderness.  The pain was positional and improved with
heating pad application; he was weaned off morphine and he was
comfortable on NSAIDs, tylenol, and flexeril.  No clinical
evidence to suggest nephrolithiasis or more concerning
etiologies. He was continued on tylenol and flexeril for two
more days.
.
# h/o atopy: This could be related to a reaction to some
environmental factor so the patient was advised to have an
outpatient allergy evaluation, and was started on nasal
steroids.  Of note, IgE returned elevated, and will require
further follow up. Out patient serum aspergillus preciptins
testing should be pursued, in addition to evaluation for ABPA.
.
# HTN: Pt's BP was between 122-150 systolic and 60 - 89
diastolic, on the day of discharge: 137/72. This could be
related to the intensive treatment with steroids in addition to
pain. However, as pt states, that prior to this exacerbating
event, an elevated BP was measured, so pt was suggested to have
an outpatient HTN evaluation after he is off steroids.
.
# Hyperglycemia:
Pt developed elevated blood sugar levels while on steroid
treatment and recieved ISS. Along with the continuation of
steroid taper on an oral base, pt will need daily FS and in case
blood sugar > 200, pt will require appropriate application of
Insulin SQ. Therefore, pt recieved education concerning FS and
insulin injection. As an underlying glucose intolerance cannot
be ruled out completely, a followup and fasting glucose level is
recommended on an outpatient base after steroid taper has been
stopped.
.
# Elevated ALT:
During stay on [**Hospital1 **], elevated ALT level was noticed (initially,
ALT 81 IU/l finally 69 IU/l), further liver tests were within
the normal range. Re-evalutaion of this parameters can be
considered on an outpatient base after he is off steroids.
.
# Elevated WBC/elevated BUN:
Pt developed increased WBC and slightly elevateed BUN. Both
findings were attributed to the steroid treatment.
.
.
ISSUES for OUTPATIENT FOLLOW-UP
.
1) Steroid Taper: Plan for taper is as follows:
- Prednisone 80 mg QD X 5 days (start [**4-3**]- [**4-7**])
- Prednisone 60 mg QD X 5 days ([**4-8**] - [**4-12**])
- Prednisone 40 mg QD X 5 days ([**4-13**]- [**4-17**])
- Prednisone 20 mg QD X 5 days ([**Date range (1) 71614**])
- Prednisone 10 mg QD X 5 days ([**Date range (1) 71615**])
- Prednisone 5 mg QD X 5 days ([**4-28**] - [**5-2**])
.
2) Hyperglycemia [**1-25**] steroids: Pt will need daily FS checks. If
blood sugar greater than 200, he will need SQ insulin. Teaching
and appropriate scripts were given to patient. PCP should
[**Name9 (PRE) 702**] regarding fasting BS once off steroids.
.
3) Asthma:
- Pulmonary consult recommended checking RAST as outpatient.
- Pt will need referral from PCP regarding local asthma clinic
and continued teaching
.
4) PCP should check LFT's, blood pressure, fasting glucose once
off steroids.
