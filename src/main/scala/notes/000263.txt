Admission Date:  [**2162-12-24**]       Discharge Date:  [**2163-1-21**]

Date of Birth:   [**2098-5-17**]       Sex:  M

Service:  Neurosurgery.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 64-year-old
male who was admitted to [**Hospital1 69**]
from [**Hospital6 5016**] on [**2162-12-24**] status post a
headache with vomiting.  Head CT showed a frontal
subarachnoid hemorrhage.  The patient was intubated at the
outside hospital and transferred to [**Hospital1 190**] for further management.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  On admission, the subarachnoid hemorrhage
extended into the pons.  He had evidence of hydrocephalus,
and a vent drain was placed.  He went to arteriogram which
showed no evidence of a source of bleeding.  He had his blood
pressure controlled with Nipride and labetalol.  He was
started on an insulin drip for high blood sugars.  He was
extubated on [**2162-12-25**].  He had a repeat head CT which
showed no changes.  He was awake, alert, moving all
extremities, and following commands bilaterally.

On [**2162-12-26**], he had a repeat head CT which showed
intraventricular blood with intracerebral blood continuing.
His labetalol drip was discontinued, and he was continued on
a Nipride drip.  He had an increase in creatinine up to 2.1.
Admission creatinine was 1.0.  He had Lopressor added for
blood pressure control, and Nipride was discontinued.  He was
continued on nimodipine for prevention of vasospasm.

The Renal Service was consulted due to his acute renal
failure.  He was placed on a Lasix drip which started on
[**2162-12-28**] and was discontinued on [**2163-1-1**].  He continued
to be on an insulin drip to keep his blood sugars under
control.  Neurologically, he was alert, following commands,
moving all extremities but confused and disoriented to place
and time.  He was occasionally agitated with tremors.  He was
also placed on renal dose Dopamine to help with kidney
perfusion and urine output.

On [**2162-12-28**], he also had difficulty with respiratory
distress and was intubated.  He was put on propofol and
sedated.  He remained intubated until [**2163-1-4**] and then was
extubated again.  His neurologic status waxed and waned.  He
had episodes where he was very lethargic and not moving his
extremities very well.  He had CT and MRI of the C-spine
which showed no evidence of cord compression.

On [**2163-1-8**], his BUN and creatinine were 59 and 1.8.  At
this point, he was off Lasix drip.  Neurologically, he was
awake, moved his right arm against gravity.  He was
impersistently following commands and externally rotated both
his lower extremities with some withdrawal to noxious
stimulation.  He continued to have a ventilator drain in
place.  He became hypernatremic with sodiums of 149-150.  His
BUN and creatinine continued to be 59 and 1.8.  He had
Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus in his sputum.

The patient was started on Lasix 40 mg p.o. t.i.d. for fluid
overload.  The patient's drain was raised to 15 cm above the
tragus on [**2163-1-11**] which he tolerated.  He continued to
have high sodium levels of 152.  He continued on Lasix t.i.d.
for fluid overload.

He had a bed-side swallow evaluation on which he had some
oral apraxia, but they obtained a video swallow, which he did
pass.  However, post procedure, he did vomit.  It was felt
that because his mental status was not completely improved,
he should hold off on feeding.  Mental status did improve,
and he did start on a regular diet.

On [**2163-1-14**], the patient's drain had been clamped for 24
hours.  He had a head CT which showed mild to moderate
ventricular dilatation.  The patient's drain was then left
clamped until [**2163-1-16**] when a repeat head CT showed no
further dilatation, and the drain was discontinued.

The patient had his diet advanced, was to be out of bed with
Physical Therapy and was transferred to the regular floor on
[**2163-1-17**].  He has remained neurologically stable with
stable vital signs.  He has tolerated a regular diet.  He has
been out of bed with physical therapy and requires acute
rehabilitation.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Metoprolol 125 mg p.o. b.i.d., hold for heart rate less
than 50, systolic blood pressure less than 100.
2.  Bacitracin ointment to his head suture site t.i.d.
3.  Insulin sliding scale.
4.  Levofloxacin 500 mg p.o. q.24 hours.
5.  Famotidine 20 mg p.o. q.day.
6.  Epogen 40,000 units once a week intravenously.
7.  Venlafaxine 37.5 mg p.o. b.i.d.
8.  Heparin 5000 units subcutaneously q.12 hours.
9.  Nimodipine 60 mg p.o. q.4 hours.
10. Albuterol inhaler one to two puffs q.6 hours p.r.n.

CONDITION:  The patient's condition is stable.

FOLLOW-UP:  The patient will follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1132**] in one
month with repeat head CT at that time.
