Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3276**]
Chief Complaint:
Cough

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
51 y/o with triple negative Stage II breast cancer s/p right
mastectomy currently on adjuvant chemotherapy with ACT presents
with persistent cough, hypoxia and low grade fevers with
evidence of bilateral ground glass opacities on CT scan
concerning of pneumonia.

Ms. [**Known lastname 88934**] reports gradual onset of shortness of breath with
associated pleuritic substernal chest pain and non productive
cough that started 3 weeks ago. She reports subjective fevers
which she started measuring last week and reports temperatures
ranging from 98 -102.  She reports no change or progression in
her symptoms over the past three weeks despite notes detailing
phone calls from her niece reporting increasing severity. The
non productive cough is so bad she sometimes cannot speak and is
worse with lying flat. She reports a 1 day history of left lower
extremity swelling. She has occasional occasional nausea,
vomiting and some episode of diarrhea week prior. She denies
rigors, sweats. She has decreased apetite, but denies abdominal
pain, diarrhea, melena, hematochezia, hematemesis, skin rashes,
joint pains, oral ulcers, urinary symptoms, numbness or
tingling, muscle tenderness or weakness.

She was seen by her primary oncologist on Monday and reported
early symptoms. A 10 day course of levofloxacin was prescribed
and a CT scan was performed which demonstrated diffuse ground
glass opacities, new since prior imaging in addition to
progression of her pulmonary artery hypertension. As her
symptoms continued to progress she was seen in clinic today.
Her o2 sats were in the 80s prompting referral to the ED.

With regards to her oncologic history, she first presented to
her PCP with [**Name Initial (PRE) **] right breast lump in [**Month (only) **] of this year with
ultimate work-up and demonstrating multicentric invasive ductal
carcinoma, histiologic grade 3 with extensive necrosis and
priminent lymphoplasmacytic infiltrates. In late [**Month (only) 205**] she
underwent right sided total masectomy with staging at pT3, and
[**3-12**] LN negative.  Her post-operative course was complicated by
admission in [**Month (only) 216**] for a chest wall abscess associated with a
surgical wound, with MSSA bacteremia and toxic shock syndrome.
In [**Month (only) **] she was initiated on systemic chemotherapy with
adriyamycin and cyclophosphamide completing 4 cycles.  On
[**10-29**] she started on Taxol. She presented to oncology
clinic on [**11-5**] for week 2 of taxol which was held in
the setting of her cough and dyspnea.

In the ED inital vitals were, 99.2 128 117/72 40 96% 4L. Labs
were significant for LDH 532, wbc 11.1, hct 26.5 and lactate of
1.3. She was hypoxic to 92% in ED and 4L NC. She was noted to be
tachypneic to the 40s. A CTA chest was limited secondary to
suboptimal bolus timing and poor field of view selection. No PE
was visualized and worsening diffuse ground glass opacities. She
was given cefepime, vancomycin and bactrim. She was bolused 2
liters of NS with good blood pressure response. Concern for
imminent decompensation therefore request for admission to ICU
for overnight monitoring requested. Vitals on transfer were
101.3 128 110/58-40's 98% 2 liters.

On arrival to the ICU,  initial vitals were 98.1 112 114/72 81
95% on 4L. She was lying in bed, mildly tachypneic and able to
answer questions in full sentences.

Imaging:
CXR [**2108-11-9**]:
IMPRESSION: Persistent bilateral diffuse airspace opacities,
similar compared to the prior CT allowing for differences in
modality. Findings again may be due to an atypical infectious
process including a viral infection, or possibly a drug
reaction.

CTA [**2108-11-9**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. Limited exam with excludion of the upper lobe pulmonary
arteries on the
CTA component; therefore pulmonary embolism within the upper
lobes cannot be excluded. No pulmonary embolism otherwise seen.
2. Worsening bilateral diffuse ground-glass opacities which
appear more
confluent. Differential considerations include drug reaction or
an
atypical/viral infection.
4. Pulmonary arterial hypertension.

CXR [**2108-11-10**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. Left subclavian central line with its tip in the distal SVC,
unchanged.  Interval improvement in aeration but a persistent
bilateral interstitial airspace process is again seen, which
could represent an atypical pneumonia or drug toxicity. Clinical
correlation is advised. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours
are likely unchanged. There is slight prominence of the main
pulmonary artery in this patient with known pulmonary
hypertension. No pneumothorax.

ECHO:  The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal
defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is mild symmetric
left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size
is normal. Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
There is no ventricular septal defect. with normal free wall
