of enlarged left subdural hematoma in the temporal parietal
lobe.  The patient had fallen earlier when he tripped over a
garden hose banging the back of his head.  He did have
positive loss of consciousness and does not recall the event.
He does have a history of hypertension, increased
cholesterol, and mitral regurgitation.  There were no
neurological changes recorded at the outside hospital.

MEDICATIONS:
1. Lipitor 10 mg p.o. q.d.
2. Atenolol.
3. Aspirin 81 mg q.d.
4. Rhinocort.
5. Advair.
6. Albuterol.


PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Remarkable for asthma.

Hypertension.

Increased cholesterol.

Mitral regurgitation.

ALLERGIES:  PENICILLIN CAUSES SWELLING.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  He is a nonsmoker, drinks wine occasionally.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Remarkable for hernia repair.

Tonsillectomy.

Nasal polyp removal.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs:  Temperature was 96.4
degrees, blood pressure was 183/70, heart rate was 71,
respiratory rate was 20, and O2 saturation was 95 percent.
The patient was awake, alert, and oriented x3.  He was
examined in his bed in the SICU.  His speech was fluent.
Pupils were [**4-20**] bilaterally and brisk.  Extraocular movements
were full.  There was no nystagmus.  Face was symmetrical.
Tongue was midline.  Sternocleidomastoid was full
bilaterally.  Motor exam showed full strength in the upper
and lower extremities bilaterally.  Sensory exam was within
normal limits to light touch in the upper and lower
extremities.  He had no drift or rebound.  Five-finger
movements were done well.  Deep tendon reflexes were 1 plus
bilaterally at brachioradialis, biceps, and triceps; 2 plus
at the knees, 1 plus at the ankles, and plantars were flexor.
There was no clonus.

CAT scan from the outside hospital did show a large left
temporal parietal acute subdural hematoma at approximately
1.8 cm with some slight midline shift.

LABORATORY DATA:  Labs at the time of admission, white count
was 10.4, hematocrit was 51.9, and platelets were 144.
Sodium was 143, potassium 3.7, chloride 106, bicarbonate 25,
BUN 22, creatinine 1.1, glucose 92.  CKs were 191, MB was 5.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  He was admitted to the SICU for close
neurological observation.  Plan was to keep his blood
pressure less than 130 and to check his coagulation labs.  He
was loaded with Dilantin and then followed with a 100 mg p.o.
t.i.d.  He did receive platelets and was scheduled to have a
repeat head CT the next morning.  Initially, while he was
managed in the Intensive Care Unit, he continued to be
neurologically stable and oriented.  He was also followed
periodically with CAT scans.  He still, at times, becomes
somewhat agitated and a little difficult to prompt in order
to answer questions.  The CAT scans that were studied
continued to show the subdural hematoma to be stable.  He did
receive prophylactic subcutaneous heparin and GI prophylaxis.
He did have some elevated blood pressures, which were managed
with Nipride and Lopressor.  He was able to be weaned off the
Nipride for blood pressure management and was then able to be
transferred to the floor.  He continued to be somnolent, but
was arousable.  He was evaluated at the bedside for
swallowing and was not found to be in aspiration risk as long
as he was prompted to remain attentive.  The patient was also
found to have some swelling in his right first toe as well as
right knee swelling and was seen by Rheumatology.  He was
started on colchicine and the fluid was aspirated and sent
for cultures.  The cultures never grew out bacteria.  He
continued to be monitored on colchicine and his symptoms did
improve.  On [**2199-7-19**], it was noted that the patient did have
some weakness in his right upper extremity.  Repeat CAT scans
remained stable.  In the morning, on [**2199-7-23**], he did have
some increased lethargy and right-sided weakness.  He was
started on mannitol and got a stat repeat head CT and it was
felt that he would be prepped to go to the OR for evacuation
of the subdural hematoma.  His INR was elevated and he
received FFP in order to reverse that, and did develop
respiratory failure with a chest x-ray showing white out of
the left lung field.  This did require intubation.  He was
also followed by cardiac enzymes, which did prove to be
elevated and he initially ruled in for myocardial infarction.  He
was
transferred for this to the Cardiac Unit.  On [**2199-7-26**], the
patient had a bedside placement of a subdural drain.  Dark
fluid did begin to drain, and it was sutured in place, and he
tolerated this procedure well.  This continued to be
monitored for drainage.  The patient did have some increased
movement with his right side.  He was started on chest
physical therapy and was able to be extubated.  The subdural
drain was slowly moved back 2 or 3 cm over
several days and this was followed with CT scans.  His mental
status did continue to improve.  The drain was removed on
[**2199-7-31**].  He was able to be transferred to the floor on
[**2199-8-1**].  His diet was increased.  He was seen by Physical
Therapy and Occupational Therapy and he did continue to
slowly improve.  His diet was advanced.  His incision
continued to be clean and dry, and his staples were removed
on [**2199-8-5**].  He is being screened by several rehabs and will
be transferred once that is available.
He should FU with Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 46653**] in 1 month with repeat Head
CT.
