CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Shortness of breath and chest pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 60-year-old
male with known coronary artery disease, hypertension, and
diabetes who was transferred to [**Hospital1 188**] from [**Hospital 1474**] Hospital after ruling in for a
myocardial infarction.

The patient was in his usual state of health until one week
ago when he developed a fever and a cough while on vacation.
He was treated initially with a 5-day course of azithromycin
but continued to have a fever and cough.  He was then
admitted to [**Hospital 1474**] Hospital on [**2-17**], where he had a
chest x-ray consistent with left lower lobe pneumonia.  He
was treated at [**Hospital 1474**] Hospital with ceftriaxone and
gatifloxacin.  He was taken for a magnetic resonance
angiography at [**Hospital 1474**] Hospital given his longstanding
history of hypertension to look for renal artery stenosis.
At that time, he developed increasing shortness of breath and
diaphoresis with no chest pain.  Cardiac enzymes were then
cycled.  He had a troponin of greater than 50, creatine
kinase of 656, and an index of 5.8.  A transesophageal
echocardiogram done at that time showed mild left ventricular
hypertrophy; distal, septal, and apical hypokinesis; basilar
inferior wall hypokinesis; and an ejection fraction of 50%.

He was transferred to the Coronary Care Unit where he was
treated with intravenous nitroglycerin, heparin, and
Aggrastat.  On [**2-20**], he developed atrial fibrillation
with a rapid ventricular response treated with digoxin and
was started on a diltiazem drip, and then transferred to [**Hospital1 1444**] for catheterization.

At [**Hospital1 69**], he underwent a
cardiac catheterization.  Please see the catheterization
report for full details.  In summary, the catheterization
report showed left main with 30% stenosis, left anterior
descending artery with a middle 90% stenosis, circumflex with
a 70% stenosis, and a right coronary artery with a middle
total occlusion.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:   His physical
examination at the time of admission revealed vital signs
with temperature of 96.4, heart rate of 130 to 140, blood
pressure of 166/86, respiratory rate of 16, oxygen saturation
of 95% on 2 liters nasal prongs.  In general, awake and
alert, in no acute distress. Head, eyes, ears, nose, and
throat revealed pupils were equally round and reactive to
light with extraocular movements intact.  No nystagmus.
Sclerae were anicteric.  Mucous membranes were moist.  The
oropharynx was clear.  Neck was supple with no jugular venous
distention.  Lungs were clear to auscultation.
Cardiovascular examination with irregularly irregular heart
rate which was tachycardic.  The abdomen was soft, nontender,
and nondistended.  Extremities revealed no clubbing, cyanosis
or edema.  Right groin without any oozing, bruit or palpable
mass.  No hematoma was present.

PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:  Laboratory data
revealed a white blood cell count of 16.5, hematocrit of 38,
platelet count of 568.  PT of 13, PTT of 33.5, INR of 1.3.
Sodium of 140, potassium of 4.3, chloride of 100, bicarbonate
of 27, blood urea nitrogen of 18, creatinine of 1, glucose
of 341.

HOSPITAL COURSE:   Following cardiac catheterization,
Cardiothoracic Surgery was consulted.  The patient was seen
and was accepted for coronary artery bypass graft.  He spent
the next several days on the Medicine Service while his
pneumonia was treated.

On [**2-24**], he was brought to the operating room at which
time he underwent coronary artery bypass graft times three.
Please see the Operative Note for full details.  In summary,
the patient had a coronary artery bypass graft times three
with a left internal mammary artery to the left anterior
descending artery and a saphenous vein graft to the diagonal
and obtuse marginal sequentially.  The patient told the
operation well and was transferred from the operating room to
the Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit.   At the time of
transfer, the patient was in a sinus rhythm.  He had an
arterial line, Swan-Ganz catheter, two mediastinal and one
pleural chest tube.  He was transferred with propofol at
20 mcg/kg per minute, nitroglycerin at 1 mcg/kg per minute,
and insulin at 3 units per hour.

The patient did well in the immediate postoperative period.
He was weaned off of his sedation.  He was weaned from the
ventilator and extubated successfully.

On postoperative day one, the patient continued to do well.
He was weaned from his nitroglycerin and insulin drips and
was transferred to [**Hospital Ward Name 121**] Six for continuing postoperative care
and cardiac rehabilitation.

Once transferred to the floor, the patient had an uneventful
postoperative course.  On a daily basis he was seen by
Physical Therapy.  His activity level was increased with the
assistance of Physical Therapy and the nursing staff.  On
postoperative day four, the patient was deemed stable and
ready for discharge to home.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON DISCHARGE:  At the time of discharge,
the patient's physical examination was as follows:  Vital
signs with a temperature of 97.3, heart rate of 74, blood
