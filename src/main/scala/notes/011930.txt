Pertinent Results:
Radiology Report CHEST (PA & LAT) Study Date of [**2175-3-28**] 12:05
PM IMPRESSION: Diffuse hazy opacity in bilateral lung bases.
While the findings may be due to a slightly atypical
distribution of pulmonary edema, focal infiltrates in particular
the right perihilar and left retrocardiac regions cannot be
entirely excluded.

Radiology Report LUNG SCAN Study Date of [**2175-3-28**]  IMPRESSION:
Low likelihood ratio for acute pulmonary embolus.

Radiology Report BILAT LOWER EXT VEINS Study Date of [**2175-3-28**]
1:56 PM
IMPRESSION: No evidence for DVT in bilateral lower extremities.

Radiology Report CT CHEST W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2175-3-29**]
10:31 AM IMPRESSION: 1. New widespread ground-glass attenuation,
septal thickening and peribronchiolar foci of consolidation. The
constellation of findings may all be due to an opportunistic
infection in this immune suppressed patient, such as viral or
PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] hydrostatic edema coexisting with pneumonia is also
possible. 2. Widespread interstitial fibrosis, probably
unchanged compared to recent CT but difficult to assess in the
setting of acute lung disease. 3. Status post hepatic
transplantation with decrease amount of ascites, but incomplete
assessment of the liver on this dedicated chest CT study. If
evaluation of liver is desired clinically, dedicated ultrasound
could be considered. 4. New small pericardial and dependent
right pleural effusions and minimal increase in dependent left
pleural effusion.

Portable TTE (Complete) Done [**2175-3-30**] at 2:41:18 PM There is
severe global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 25-30 %).
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2175-2-13**],
the left ventricular systolic function has significantly
worsened (LVEF >55%)

Radiology Report CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2175-3-30**] 3:26
AM FINDINGS: Interval placement of endotracheal tube and
nasogastric tube in
standard position. Rapid progression of widespread bilateral
alveolar
opacities, superimposed upon underlying interstitial
abnormality. In an
immunosuppressed patient, this may reflect rapidly progressive
opportunistic infection, possibly complicated by ARDS. A
component of hydrostatic edema is also possible. Persistent
small right pleural effusion, but no evidence of pneumothorax.

Radiology Report CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2175-3-31**] 4:50
AM INDICATION: Bilateral infiltrates. Indwelling devices are in
standard position. Cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged.
Widespread combined alveolar and interstitial opacities show
mild to moderate improvement in the right perihilar region, but
slight worsening in the left retrocardiac area. Right pleural
effusion has slightly decreased in size and small left effusion
is unchanged.

Radiology Report DUPLEX DOP ABD/PEL LIMITED Study Date of
[**2175-3-31**] 2:49 PM IMPRESSION: 1. No hydronephrosis or stone. Mild
fullness in the left renal pelvis. Small simple cyst in the left
kidney. 2. Markedly thickened bladder wall, which may be due to
symmetric bladder wall hypertrophy from outflow obstruction or
spastic bladder neuropathy. 3. The Foley balloon tip is somewhat
low relative to the residual fluid in the bladder. DOPPLER
ULTRASOUND: Doppler exam was limited as the patient was on a
ventilator. There is good systolic upslope in the main renal
arteries bilaterally. RIs range from 0.71-0.73 on the right and
0.72-0.75 on the left.

Portable TTE (Complete) Done [**2175-4-4**] at 10:00:00 AM. There is
moderate global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 30-35 %).
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2175-3-30**],
overall left ventricular function is slightly more vigorous. The
estimated pulmonary artery pressures are lower.

Radiology Report CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2175-4-4**] 3:40
AM Since [**2175-4-2**], multifocal alveolar opacity slightly
improved, likely
due to improved multifocal pneumonia. Atypical pulmonary edema
cannot be
ruled out, would be improved. Small bilateral pleural effusions
are
unchanged. Heart size is still top normal.


Brief Hospital Course:
Pt admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**4-8**] for shortness of breath,
tachycardia and increased O2 requirement. Initial CXR on [**4-8**]
concerning for a RLL pneumonia, A V/Q scan was done as well as
lower extremity venous duplex studies which were low probability
for PE and did not demonstrate venous thrombosis in the lower
extremities. Empiric levofloxacin was begun for suspected
pneumonia. A chest CT done on [**3-29**] showed widespread global
ground glass opacities. Empiric ABX coverage was broadened to
Vancomycin, Zosyn, and levofloxacin. Pt continued to
decompensate from a respiratory perspective with arterial blood
gases showing markedly low CO2 in the 22-25 range. The pt was
transported to the ICU on [**2175-3-29**] due to increased work of
breathing and persistently low CO2 on ABG. The Infectious
disease service as well as pulmonology were consulted. The pt
was intubated on [**2175-3-30**]. An in-depth workup for possible
infectious agents was conducted. A bronchoscopy with lavage was
done on which did not grow any organisms. A trans thoracic echo
was performed on [**3-30**] which revealed global dysfunction and an EF
of 25-30% which has previously been >55%. The Cardiology service
was consulted at this time as well. Tube feeds via [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 43199**]
[**Last Name (un) **]-duodenal catheter were begun on [**2175-4-1**]. Vanc and Zosyn
were discontinued on [**4-2**] as cultures remained negative and an
empiric course of levofloxacin was continued. Clinically
Mr.[**Known lastname **] improved from a respiratory standpoint and was
extubated on [**4-1**]. The pt was transferred to the floor out of
the ICU on [**2175-4-5**]. He continuied to clinically improve as a
course of empiric levofloxacin was completed on [**
