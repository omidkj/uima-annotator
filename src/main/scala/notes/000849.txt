History of Present Illness:
55 year old male who complains of chest pain. This patient was 5
feet up on a ladder sawing off a 200 pound tree branch which
swung from exporting rope striking him in the right chest. It
knocked him off the ladder. There was a documented LOC. He went
to [**Hospital6 3105**] where imaging showed multiple rib
fractures on the right, 7 through 9 with a suspected flail
segment, a pulmonary contusion, and a pleural effusion on the
right. There was no pneumothorax. Because of all of these
findings, he was sent to [**Hospital1 **] for further
evaluation and treatment. He has had CT scans read by attending
radiologist of his brain, cervical spine, and torso. The
injuries above are the only injuries that were found.

Past Medical History:
PMH: sleep apnea, hypothyroidism, depression, ADHD
PSH: tonsillectomy, perianal surgery for wart removal

3 L Normal

Constitutional: Comfortable boarded and collared with a GCS
of 15.
On the triage sheet, there was an O2 sat of 93%, but all of

have all been 97% and above.

[**2125-1-31**]:  chest x-ray:

IMPRESSION: Elevated right hemidiaphragm with tiny right pleural
effusion,
atelectasis and several displaced right rib fractures, but no
pneumothorax.
Please refer to CT for further details.

[**2125-2-1**]:  chest x-ray:

 IMPRESSION:
1) Fractures are in closer approximation with no pneumothorax.
2) Increased right basilar atelectasis with small right pleural
effusion.
Right hemidiaphragm is stably elevated.

[**2125-2-2**]:  right shoulder x-ray:

No acute bony injury. Mild degenerative changes of the AC joint.

[**2125-2-4**]:  CTA chest:

IMPRESSION: Flail chest with contiguous segmental fractures of
the right
8th-10th ribs and subsequent development of a large hemothorax
since four
days prior, now with compressive atelectasis without evidence of
pneumothorax.
No evidence of pulmonary embolism.

[**2125-2-4**]:  chest x-ray:


Right chest tube remains in place with its tip at the apex.
There is
persistent elevation of the right hemidiaphragm with patchy
opacity at the
right base which either reflects loculated pleural fluid within
the horizontal fissure or could represent an evolving pneumonia.
Clinical correlation is advised. The left lung remains grossly
clear. No pneumothorax is seen. No evidence of pulmonary edema.
Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable

[**2125-2-4**]:  chest x-ray:

1. Interval placement of a right internal jugular central line
which has its tip in the distal SVC at the cavoatrial junction.
Right chest tube remains unchanged in position. Endotracheal
tube and nasogastric tube also unchanged; however, the
nasogastric tube has its side port near the gastroesophageal
junction.

2. Cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable. Left lung
demonstrates
slightly improved aeration at the left base with residual patchy
atelectasis.
There is also patchy atelectasis at the right base with an
associated layering effusion. No large pneumothorax is seen;
however, the ability to detect a pneumothorax on a supine
radiograph is diminished. Several right-sided anterolateral rib
fractures are again identified.

[**2125-2-7**]:  chest x-ray:

IMPRESSION: Enlarging moderate to large right pneumothorax
sufficient to
shift mediastinum contralaterally, but not to displace the right

hemidiaphragm

[**2125-2-8**]:  chest x-ray:

IMPRESSION: Increasing size in right pneumothorax.

Brief Hospital Course:
55 year old gentleman admitted to the acute care service after
falling off a ladder while cutting a branch.  He sustained loss
of consciousness as a result of the fall.  He was taken to an
outside hospital where on imaging he was found to have  multiple
rib fractures on the right, 7 through 9 with a likely flail
segment, a pulmonary contusion, and a pleural effusion on the
right. He was transferred here for further management. He was
admitted to the intensive care unit for observation. During this
time, he had an epidural catheter placed for management of his
rib pain.  This was discontinued in 48 hours and he was
transitioned to PCA.  His vital signs and respiratory status
remained stable and he was transferred to the surgical floor on
HD #3.

While on the floor, he had a late presentation right-sided
hemothorax which required emergent chest tube placement and
transfer back to the ICU. A CTA of the chest was done which
showed a flail chest with contiguous segmental fractures of the
right
8th-10th ribs and subsequent development of a large hemothorax
with compressive atelectasis without evidence of pneumothorax.
His epidural catheter was replaced and he required neosynephrine
for blood pressure support. He was intubation for increased
respiratory distress.  He was bronched and started on
vancomycin, cefepime, and ciprofloxacin for hospital acquired
pneumonia. The thoracic service was consulted on HD #5 for
possible rib plating to help facilitate his pulmonary status.

He was taken to the operating room on HD #6 where he underwent a
right thoracotomy and evacuation of hemothorax.  At this time,he
also had an internal rib fixation of ribs #7, 8, and 9.
His operative course was stable with a EBL of 100cc.  He did
require additional PRBC during the procedure. He was bronched at
the
