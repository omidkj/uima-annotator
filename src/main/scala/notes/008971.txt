History of Present Illness:
65 y/o female with a h/o T2DM, HTN, and PVD who was found down
by home health aid. EMS was called and patient's blood sugar was
found to be 12. She had an IV placed in her left shin and
received glucagon and 1 amp D50 as well as thiamine. Her BS
increased to 202 and patient became more responsive. When she
arrived to the ED, she had copious secretions and was satting
100% on RA but she was intubated in the ED because it was felt
she could not protect her airway. CXR was done which was
consistent with asymetric CHF vs. an infectious process such as
aspiration PNA. Patient received a dose of vanc/flagyl/levo in
the ED.
.
In the ICU, she was extubated on HOD #2 but re-intubated several
days later for hypoxemic respiratory failure, possibly from
bilateral upper-lobe PNA vs BOOP. She was treated with steroids
and received a course of Vanc/Zosyn and was extubated approx 2
days later. At time of transfer to the floor, her O2 sats were
99% on 2L. BP had been difficult to control and was on NTG gtt
briefly. She also became hyperglycemic requiring an insulin gtt
but was transitioned to SC insulin.
.
She was transferred to the medical floor hemodynamically stable.

Imaging:
[**2115-5-30**]: CT head - No cranial hemorrhage, shift of normally
midline structures, or evidence of acute major vascular
territorial infarct is apparent. Mild-to-moderate
periventricular white matter hypodensity predominates in the
frontal lobes and is likely the sequelae of chronic small vessel
infarction. Sulcal and ventricular prominence is likely related
to age-related atrophy. Mucosal thickening involving several
ethmoid air cells and the sphenoid sinus is noted. Surrounding
osseous structures are unremarkable and no fracture is seen.
.
[**2115-5-30**]: TTE -
The LA is normal in size. There is mild symmetric LVH. The
LVcavity size is normal. Overall LV systolic function is normal
(LVEF 70%). Tissue Doppler imaging  suggests an increased
LVfilling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
Transmitral Doppler and tissue velocity imaging are consistent
with Grade II (moderate) LV diastolic dysfunction. There is no
VSD. RV chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The AV
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but AS is not present. No
aortic regurgitation is seen. The MV leaflets are mildly
thickened.  There is no MV prolapse. Trivial MR is seen. There
is moderate PA systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
effusion.
.
[**2115-6-4**]: CT Chest -
1. Diffuse bilateral airspace disease, upper lobe predominant,
concerning for pneumonia.
2. Mediastinal lymphadenopathy, which may be reactive.
3. Left PICC line distal tip at the level of the left
brachiocephalic vein.
4. Stable left adrenal thickening.
5. No acute inflammatory process within the abdomen or pelvis.
6. Heterogeneous thyroid, correlation with thyroid ultrasound is
recommended in a nonemergent basis
.
[**2115-6-14**] CT Abdomen and Pelvis W/O Contrast
No specific CT finding to explain patient's abdominal pain.
Unchanged appearance of left adrenal thickening.
Unchanged appearance of age-indeterminate compression deformity
of the superior endplate of T12.

Brief Hospital Course:
65 y/o female with a h/o T2DM, PVD, and hypertension who was
found down at home with a blood sugar of 12 complicated by
aspiration PNA. She was initially intubated for airway
protection with rapid extubation. However her intensive care
course was further complicated by progressive respiratory
distress thought secondary to hospital acquired pneumonia. She
was subsequently transferred to the medical floor after
improvement in her respiratory status. The following issues were
addressed during this hospitalization.
.
1. Hypoglycemia/T2DM
The trigger to the pt's initial hypoglycemia was most likely an
medication error as patient has a long standing h/o T2DM and
takes insulin at home. Her blood sugars responded to glucagon
and 1 amp D50. With monitoring the patient improved and slowly
NPH was added. It was titrated up as tolerated to maintain
excellent glycemic control.
.
2. Respiratory distress
The patient intubated in the ED for copious secretions and it
was felt she would be unable to protect her airway. She was
diuresed with lasix to improve pulmonary function. Patient was
extubated successfully on [**2115-5-31**]. She was treated for 5 days
with levo/flagyl for aspiration pna. The patient continued to
have episodes of hypertension and flash edema. With CPAP and
lasix she initially responded and her blood pressure meds were
increased to prevent flash pulmonary edema. She required
aggressive diuresis given her fluid overload. However, on [**6-4**]
she continued to have worsening respiratory status and presumed
ARDS secondary to HAP. She was intubated and treated with
vanc/zosyn. Given CT scan, she completed 10 days total of
vanc/zosyn.  She was initially started on steroids for concern
of BOOP, however these were rapidly tapered. Pulmonary was
consulted and felt that her clinical picture was most consistent
with pneumonia. She was changed to levofloxacin on [**2115-6-12**] and
will complete a five day course. Pulmonary recommended an
outpatient pulmonary follow up, CT chest 4-6 weeks, outpatient
sleep study, and outpatient echocardiogram to assess for
pulmonary hypertension. She will need continued pulmonary toilet
upon discharge to acute rehab.
.
3. Anemia
Patient's anemia is [**2-15**] to iron deficiency anemia along with
anemia of chronic disease. She had no evidence of bleeding. Her
blood count was monitored and was stable.
.
4. HTN
The patient had persistently elevated blood pressures requiring
a nitroglycerine drip initially.  She continued on her
outpatient anti-HTN medications: metoprolol, amlodipine,
hydralazine, Imdur at increased doses where able.  Her diuretic
was held with regard to her acute on chronic renal failure as
below.
.
5. CAD/chest pain
Patient had chest pain that seemed MSK given reproducibility but
upsloping of ST in III and aVF was intially concerning for
ischemia. However, she completed a rule-out for MI.
.
6. Gout
Patient has a history of gout. The patient remained on her
allopurinol. She did experience a gout flare in her left foot
and colchicine was added with success. She will be discharged to
rehab on colchicine but it will be stopped once her flare
resolves.
.
7. CRI with ARF
Patient admitted at baseline creatinine, which is most likely
secondary to diabetic
