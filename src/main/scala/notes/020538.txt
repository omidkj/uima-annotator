Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2387**]
Chief Complaint:
S/p cardiac arrest

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
ICD placement
Cardiac catheterization


History of Present Illness:
46yoM with no cardiac history who was in the outpatient waiting
area of [**Hospital6 2910**] on [**2117-8-4**], waiting for his
wife who was having a procedure. He collapsed, had reported
seizure-like activity and urinary incontinence, then had
subsequent cardiac arrest, was intubated with ETT #7, received
1mg Epinephrine via ET tube, shocked once with return of
palpable femoral pulses within 15-30 secs after first shock, and
then given second 1mg Epinephrine. He began to move afterwards,
but pupils were noted to be "midsized and not responsive to
light." He was noted to have "spontaneous respiration" and then
transferred to ICU. Review of the strips was concerning for VFib
but ICU MD thinks maybe PEA.
.
Through his ICU course:
ABG there showed 7.31/37/477/19; normal BMP/Ca/Mg, WBC 14.9, Hct
44, Plts 269. He was given 1gm Mg and started on Propofol gtt. L
subclavian CVL was placed. ? infiltrate in RML on CXR for which
he is on Clindamycin; there was also concern for ? L clavicle
fracture that per discussion may be old (he is a steel worker
and was seeing a doctor and PT for L shoulder pain previous to
this). He is ventilated with 500 Tv, PEEP 5, FiO2 50%, and has
had no issues on the vent. Exam on admission significant for
pupils 2mm equal but not responsive to light, no doll's eyes,
decerebrate posturing, fine tremor in BUE's, irregular rhythm
with systolic murmur, wheezy lungs. Out of concern for the
"seizure" they have CT'd his head which was negative, and did an
EEG which did not show any seizure activity; per discussion they
did not feel that he actually had any seizure.
.
Per discussion with NEBH ICU physician, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] was Wellens pattern
in V3-4 with deep symmetric T waves. Echo significant for PASP
25-30, EF 55%, HK of mid to distal anterior free wall and
anteroseptum. Initial Trop on ICU admission was 2.5 but was
risen to 5 last night, and 11 this am. He has had no arrthymic
issues.
.
This am, he continues on Heparin gtt 1300 (with prolonged PTT),
Amiodarone 0.5mg/min gtt, and has been on 325 ASA, was Plavix
loaded 600 and 75 daily, Atorvastatin 80 daily, Lopressor 25 q6,
still intubated on Propofol. Just this am he has developed mild
hypoTN to the 90's for which he is being bolused with IVF's, no
pressors.   Plan is to transfer to CCU and have cardiac cath at
11a today with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
.
The pt's wife arrived and confirms he has no cardiac history, no
h/o HTN, HL, DM, FHx, but does actively smoke a few cigarettes
daily. His cardiac ROS was entirely negative before the event,
is very active without complaints of angina, DOE, syncope,
dizziness, swelling.
.
ROS otherwise with some musculoskeletal complaints; he had a
herniated disc and subsequent lower extremity radiculopathic
pain. She states he was doing PT, who wanted him to do some
weight lifting, and then for the past week was having L shoulder
pain (? L clavicle fx on CXR?). Also with some
depression/anxiety from being on disability and not being able
to work, otherwise all negative.
.

ECG:
NEBH #1 = ~100 NSR, normal axis/intervals, elevations in
hyperacute TW's in V1-3, STD in V3-4, TWI in V5-6 and I/aVL;
possible Q wave in V1-3
NEBH #2 = worsening symmetric TWI in V4-6 and I/aVL and TWF
inferior leads
NEBH #3 = about the same but with STD inferior leads,
improvement in lateral TWI's
.
At NEBH on [**2117-8-4**]: normal LV size, wall thickness, HK of
mid-distal anterior and anteroseptal region. LV systolic fxn low
normal at 50-55%, RVSP = 23 + RAP
.
NEBH head CT non contrast without acute abnormality
.
Cardiac cath ([**2117-8-5**])
1. Selective coronary angiography of this left dominant system
demonstrated non-obstructive coronary artery disease.  The LMCA
and LAD
had minimal disease.  The LCx was a large vessel with mild
disease.  The
RCA was a small, non-dominant vessel.
2. Limited resting hemodynamics revealed elevated right- and
left-sided
filling pressures, with a mean RA pressure of 15 mmHg, and a
LVEDP of 24
mmHg.  The systemic arterial pressure was noted to be normal,
with a
central aortic pressure of 106/65, mean 82 mmHg.  No gradient
was seen
on careful pullback from the left ventricle to the aorta.
