Service:  CARDIOTHORACIC SURGERY

HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 69-year-old male
with a long-standing history of poorly controlled
hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and hypercholesterolemia, who
presented to the [**Hospital6 256**] on
[**2126-3-26**] on referral from his primary care provider for
poorly controlled hypertension.  The patient reportedly told
his primary care provider that he was suffering several
months worth of increased dyspnea on exertion associated with
throat constriction that occurred following walking for less
than two blocks.  The patient denied any occurrence of
symptoms at rest.  The patient was advised to undergo a
Persantine MIBI study at [**Hospital6 1597**]; however, the
scheduled study had to be cancelled secondary to the
patient's increased blood pressure.

The patient was subsequently referred to the [**Hospital6 1760**] for further evaluation and
was admitted to the Cardiac Medicine Service on [**2126-3-26**] for further evaluation and management.

ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient works as a stock broker.  No
history of alcohol or drug abuse.  Twenty-five pack year
history of smoking, however, the patient no longer smokes.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 196**]
Service on [**2126-3-26**] under the direction of Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
The patient was initially managed with Captopril, Lopressor,
and aspirin; however, several episodes of spontaneously
increased blood pressure over the course of his two hospital
admission days resulted in the addition of nitroglycerin
paste for additional pressure control.

An echocardiogram obtained on [**2126-3-27**], demonstrated
evidence of inducible ischemia; subsequent cardiac
catheterization demonstrated three vessel coronary artery
disease with 90% occlusion of the proximal LAD, 80%
midsegment occlusion of the left circumflex, and 80-90%
occlusion of the right coronary artery.  The cardiac
catheterization additionally demonstrated mild to moderate
diastolic biventricular dysfunction.  The patient's ejection
fraction was noted to be approximately 51% with no evidence
of focal regional wall abnormalities.

Following extensive discussions with this patient and his
family regarding the risks and benefits of surgical
intervention, the patient was scheduled for an emergent
coronary artery bypass graft procedure on [**2126-3-28**].
The patient tolerated the procedure well with a CABG times
three with anastomosis from the LIMA to LAD, saphenous vein
graft to the PDA, and saphenous vein graft to the OM.  Total
bypass time was 71 minutes; cross clamp time was 37 minutes.
The patient's pericardium was left open; intraoperative lines
placed included an arterial line and a Swan-Ganz catheter;
two ventricular wires and one atrial and one ground wire were
placed; both mediastinal and left pleural tubes were placed.

The patient was subsequently transferred from the Operating
Room to the Cardiac Surgery Recovery Unit, intubated for
further evaluation and management.  On transfer, the
patient's mean arterial pressure was 74, CVP 10, PAD 19, [**Doctor First Name 1052**]
23.  The patient was noted to be in atrially paced rhythm.
On transfer, the patient was on a propofol drip.

Shortly following arrival in the CSRU, the patient was
successfully weaned and extubated without complication.  The
patient progressed well clinically in the CSRU through
postoperative day number three, at which point he was cleared
for transfer to the floor and was subsequently admitted to
the Cardiothoracic Service under the direction of Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 70**].

The patient was reviewed by Physical Therapy who deemed him
an appropriate discharge to home following completion of his
medical care.  The patient's postoperative course was notable
for occasional incidents of elevated blood pressure with
systolics in the 160s and 170s, as well as significant
anxiety on the part of the patient.

On postoperative day number five, the patient was begun on
Norvasc to good effect and was thereafter noted to have
reasonable blood pressure control for the remainder of his
stay.

On postoperative day number three, [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] diabetes consult
was also obtained to assist the patient in home training and
dietary control of his diabetes.  The patient demonstrated a
reasonable understanding of his illness and was provided with
a Glucometer for home, fingerstick glucose monitoring.

On postoperative day number six, the patient complained of a
diffuse itching; physical examination demonstrated a mild
papular dry rash effecting the patient's trunk.  The patient
was subsequently advised to refrain from ingestion of opiate
pain medications and demonstrated progressive relief from his
pruritic symptoms over the following days with therapy via
Benadryl and Sarna lotion.  In addition, the patient
demonstrated intermittent episodes of respiratory wheezing
which were responsive to Albuterol nebulizer treatments.  The
patient was subsequently trained in the use of an Albuterol
inhaler following clear x-ray studies demonstrating no
evidence of pulmonary infiltrate.

Following the removal of his Foley catheter, the patient
failed a voiding trial and required reinsertion of the
catheter with a postvoid residual noted of 925 cc.  Urology
consult was obtained and advised the patient to maintain the
Foley in place for five to seven days following discharge
with a scheduled voiding trial follow-up with the Urology
Service on an outpatient basis.

At the request of the patient's primary care provider, [**Name10 (NameIs) **]
patient was also set up with an outpatient MRA to evaluate
his renal perfusion and assess for possible evidence of
renovascular hypertension.

By postoperative day number eight, the patient was noted to
be ambulatory and tolerating a full regular diet with
adequate pain control provided oral pain medications.  The
patient was noted to have mild persistent respiratory
wheezing responsive to Albuterol inhaler treatment, as well
as steadily improving opioid related pruritus.  The patient
was subsequently cleared for discharge to home with VNA
services on postoperative day number eight, [**2126-4-5**], with
instructions for follow-up.

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:  The patient is to maintain his Foley
catheter in place until follow-up appointment with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 365**] five to seven days following discharge for a voiding
trial.  The patient is to maintain his sternal Steri-Strips
in place and keep incisions clean and dry at all times; the
patient should not remove his strips but let them fall off on
their own.  The patient may shower but should pat dry
incisions afterwards; no bathing or swimming until further
notice.  The patient may resume a regular diabetic diet.  The
