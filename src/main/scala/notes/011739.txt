Service:  MICU ORANGANGE

HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname 4401**] was an
83-year-old male with a questionable history of interstitial
lung disease for the past 2 [**12-10**] to 3 years, GERD, status post
transurethral resection of prostate, appendectomy, knee
surgery, and shoulder surgery.  He was admitted on [**2117-4-12**] for increasing shortness of breath and cough with
productive sputum including some blood-tinged sputum for two
to three weeks.  The patient did complain of some pleuritic
chest pain, general malaise, subjective fevers and chills.
He denied orthopnea or chest pain outside of respirations.
He had no nausea or vomiting, no diaphoresis, no abdominal or
back pain, no sore throat.

The patient was admitted to the hospital and treated for
community acquired pneumonia with ceftriaxone and
Azithromycin.  He had an echocardiogram that showed an EF of
greater than 60%, chest x-rays which showed alveolar and
interstitial patterns bilaterally, suggestive of bilateral
pneumonia on chronic lung disease.  The patient also had a
high-resolution chest CAT scan which showed bilateral apical
ground glass and midfield ground glass opacifications,
peripheral honeycombing, bilateral effusions.

On [**2117-4-14**], a MICU consult was called for the patient's
increasing hypoxia on high-flow oxygen.  The patient was
switched from azithromycin to Levaquin so he was on
ceftriaxone and Levaquin.  His sats decreased to the mid 80s
on 70% face mask, went up to the low 90s on 100%
nonrebreather.  The patient was tachypneic, using some
accessory muscles and speaking in three to four word
sentences.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Interstitial lung disease.
2.  Question of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis for 2 [**12-10**] to 3
years, never worked up.
3.  GERD.
4.  Benign prostatic hypertrophy, status post TURP in [**2116-7-9**].
5.  Bilateral total knee replacements.
6.  Status post appendectomy.
7.  Left shoulder surgery.

ADMISSION MEDICATIONS:
1.  Aspirin p.r.n.
2.  Aciphex.

ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives with his 76-year-old wife
and still works part-time in a sporting goods store.  He was
a retired physical education teacher.  The patient had a ten
year pack history of smoking, quit 50 years ago.  He uses
occasional alcohol.  No recent travel.  No asbestos exposure.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Noncontributory.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION TO THE ICU:  Vital signs:
Temperature 98.9, blood pressure 132/73, heart rate 85-90,
respiratory rate 20-24, pulse ox 83-93% on nonrebreather.
General:  He was in minimal distress with difficulty
breathing but pleasant.  HEENT:  Pupils were equal, round,
and reactive to light and accommodation.  Extraocular motions
intact.  The patient had moist mucous membranes.  Chest:
Bilateral rhonchi and crackles at the bases.  Cardiac:
Questionably irregular rate with S1, S2, no murmur.  Abdomen:
Positive bowel sounds, soft, nontender, nondistended.
Extremities:  No edema, bilateral knee scars.  Neurologic:
Alert and oriented times three, moving all extremities.

LABORATORY/RADIOLOGIC DATA ON ADMISSION:  Chemistries were
unremarkable.  The patient had a white count of 15.4,
hematocrit 33.5, platelets 261,000.  Coagulation studies were
unremarkable.  The patient had a blood gas which was
7.48/36/66.  The patient's urine had some white cells but was
essentially unremarkable.

The EKG showed atrial fibrillation versus MAT with right axis
right bundle branch block and some nonspecific ST changes.

Chest x-ray, as in HPI.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was brought into the MICU.  He
spiked a fever and became delirious.  Cultures were sent of
blood and urine and chest x-ray was repeated.  Over his first
several days in the unit, the patient was treated
conservatively with continued ceftriaxone and Levaquin
antibiotics, pulmonary therapy, and supplemental oxygen.  He
continued to be in moderate distress and from time to time
became disoriented and agitated, requiring Haldol and
sedation.  His atrial fibrillation was treated with
anticoagulation and he was started on Lopressor for rate
control.

After several days of conservative treatment, the patient was
semi-electively intubated and had bronchoscopy performed on
[**2117-4-17**] with multiple specimens sent.  The patient's
oxygenation and blood gas improved markedly on the
ventilator.  However, the bronchoalveolar lavage cultures
essentially yielded no data in terms of micro-organism,
fungal etiology, or Legionella as all were negative.

On [**2117-4-19**], the patient was extubated after appearing to
do well on his respirations.  However, he gradually became
tachypneic into the 40s with decreasing 02 values.  He failed
mask ventilation and was reintubated.  It should also be
noted that throughout the course of the patient's Intensive
Care stay, his CVP was monitored and initially diuresis was
attempted to improve his breathing and oxygenation.  However,
this failed.  Additionally, doxycycline was added for
additional atypical antimicrobial coverage.

On [**2117-4-21**], a family meeting was held by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and
numerous members of the patient's family to try to ascertain
what the care plan should be and what the patient would want
done.  At this point, the family elected to watch the patient
for several more days but fairly unanimously decided that he
would most likely want conservative care and extubation
eventually.

On the patient's final days of MICU hospitalization, his
sedation was greatly lightened and he was able to communicate
through hand squeezes and gestures with family and staff.
The patient stated that he was in no pain.  Viral and other
cultures continued to remain negative throughout the
[**Hospital 228**] hospital stay.  He had an additional febrile
episode on [**2117-4-22**] and had sputum, blood, and urine
cultures sent, all of which remained negative.

On [**2117-4-24**], the patient's family felt that they were
ready to withdraw.  Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 553**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] had some final
discussions with the family including some thoughts of
empiric steroid treatment versus going further with possible
VATs and/or tracheostomy.  However, the family ultimately
decided to make the patient CMO and extubate him.  The
patient passed away shortly thereafter.

The patient's primary care physician, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**First Name (STitle) 679**] of the
Gastroenterology Department, was frequently in to see the
patient and aware of the plans during all of these time
periods.
