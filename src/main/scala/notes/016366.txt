Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 398**]
Chief Complaint:
Fever, cough

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Arterial Line Placement
PICC placement and removal
Central Venous Line Placement x2
PEG tube placement
Midline placement
Stoma Intubation

History of Present Illness:
85 y.o. Male w/ papillary thyroid CA s/p thyroidectomy with
radioactive iodine ablation, SCC of the larynx s/p total
laryngectomy w/ modified radical neck dissection with stoma,
metastatic prostate cancer with metastatic lesions to the bone
presenting to the ED with 2day history of fevers, chills,
fatigue, poor PO intake and non-productive cough. Via
translation with pt's family member 2 days ago pt felt "unwell",
fatigued with some chills and subjective fevers. Pt also noted
some abdominal discomfort, rt sided chest pain, dizziness.
Unfortunately after spending several days not feeling hungry due
to his fatigue he called his son to take him to the hospital on
the morning of admission.

He also endorses several episodes of BRBPR for the past 2 days.
Per his son he has had problems with BRBPR over the past few
months.

Upon arrival to the [**Name (NI) **] pt was noted to be febrile with a rectal
temp of 104.4, tachycardic at 102, copious secretions with
saturation after suctioning in the mid 90s on a trach mask. A
chest X-ray was obtained, notable for RLL PNA. Pt was also noted
to go into A-fib into the rate of 200, pt was given 20mg IV
Diltiazem which reduced his rate to 150s and with additional
fluids 130s. Pt received levofloxacin, cefepime, vancomycin as
well as 5l NS fluid in the ED, bld cultures x 2 drawn. Prior to
transfer to the floor pt was noted to have desaturations and was
intubated through his stoma. Levophed was also initiated due to
an SBP in the mid 90s following Versed and Fentanyl for
intubation.

ROS was otherwise essentially negative. The pt denied headaches,
vomiting, hemoptysis, hematemesis, coffee-ground emesis,
dysuria, hematuria.

Imaging:
CXR ([**2-8**]): Infectious pneumonia involving the right middle lobe
and right
upper lobe. Followup to resolution is recommended to exclude
underlying
malignancy.

TTE ([**2-9**]): The left atrium is mildly dilated. The right atrium
is moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic
function (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free
wall motion are normal. The aortic root is moderately dilated at
the sinus level. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no
mitral valve prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. The
pulmonic valve prosthesis is not well seen. There is no
pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
preserved global and regional biventricular systolic function.
Mild aortic regurgitation. Mild pulmonary hypertension. Biatrial
enlargement.

Upper extrem US ([**2-17**]):
1. Near complete occlusive thrombus surrounding the left PICC
line in the left brachial and axillary veins. Occlusive thrombus
also noted within a second left brachial vein.
2. Subcutaneous edema.

CT abd/pelvis ([**2-17**]):
1. Moderate-sized right rectus abdominis hematoma corresponding
to palpable abnormality as discussed with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 34732**]
at the time of dictation.
2. Large right and moderate left pleural effusions with patchy
opacities
consistent with infectious process within the right middle and
lower lobes. Lingular opacity reflects infection and/or
atelectasis.
3. New hypoattenuating lesions within the liver are not well
evaluated on
this non-contrast enhanced study however consistent with new
metastatic
disease. Small amount of ascites surrounds the liver.
4. Anasarca.
5. Progression of sclerotic metastasis within the spine without
evidence of spinal canal encroachment.

Brief Hospital Course:
85 yo M, Cantonese-speaking only with PMH of tracheostomy s/p
laryngectomy, met prosate CA, thyroid CA, who presented with
fever, hypoxia and new A-fib with RVR.

# Sepsis: On admission to the ICU the patient was septic meeting
SIRS criteria with tachycardia, temperature of >104, tachypnea
and white blood count with bandemia with a suspected pulmonary
source, pneumonia. In the ED his Lactate level was initially
noted to be 6.1. In the [**Name (NI) **] pt was started on pressor support
with Levophed, intubated through his stoma for continued
hypoxia, and an initial antibiotic regimen of Levofloxacin,
Cefepime, Vancomycin. Antibiotic regimen was then changed to
Vancomycin, Zosyn, Levofloxacin during his first night of
admission. Following 2 days of fluid resuscitation pt was weaned
of pressor support. Following a negative MRSA screening pt's
antibiotic regimen was narrowed to Zosyn and Levofloxacin and he
completed a 10 day course of these antibiotics on [**2-18**]. Pt's
leukocytosis reached a maximum of 16.4 and then trended d
