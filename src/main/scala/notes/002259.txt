IMAGING
CXR [**2121-12-26**]:
IMPRESSION: Endotracheal and nasogastric tubes in appropriate
position as
detailed above. Very limited evaluation of the lungs given the
profoundly low lung volumes. There is, however, extensive patchy
opacity at the left lung and aspiration versus pneumonia is
highly likely.
.
CT head w/o contrast [**2121-12-26**]:
IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial process. Nasal secretions
