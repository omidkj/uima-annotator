Studies:
ECG:
Sinus rhythm. Tracing is without diagnostic abnormality

Chest AP portable:
SINGLE PORTABLE UPRIGHT VIEW OF THE CHEST: There is unchanged
moderate
cardiomegaly, with midline intact sternal wires and vascular
clips from prior CABG. A left chest pacing device is in
unchanged position. A mechanical valve is also apparently
unchanged. Lung volumes are low and there is mild atelectasis at
the lung bases, but no focal consolidation. Overall, vascular
congestion appears similar to the prior study.

IMPRESSION: No significant change since [**2114-6-3**].

Colonoscopy [**2-/2115**]:
Diverticulosis of the descending colon and sigmoid colon
Otherwise normal colonoscopy to cecum

EGD [**4-/2116**]:
Patchy erythema of the mucosa was noted in the duodenal bulb
compatible with mild duodenitis.
Impression: Erythema in the duodenal bulb compatible with mild
duodenitis
Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum

Brief Hospital Course:
Assessment and Plan: 63 year old male with history of mitral
valve prolapse s/p MVR with [**Hospital3 9642**] valve on coumadin
presented with GI bleed.

# GIB: Mr. [**Known lastname 10881**] symptoms were felt to be most consistent with
UGIB. He was admitted to the MICU for monitoring. He was
evaluated by the gastroenterology service, who recommended
waiting for endoscopy until the patient's INR came < 3. He
underwent endoscopy on [**2116-4-10**] which showed erythema in the
duodenal bulb compatible with mild duodenitis, but otherwise
normal study. There was no active bleeding noted. He received a
total of 7 units of packed RBCs to maintain his hematocrit
during this admission. Aspirin was held.  Following transfer
from the ICU to the floor, the patient remained hemodynamically
stable with stable Hct, but continued to have melanic stools.  A
capsule endoscopy was thus performed on [**2116-4-14**], with the
results pending at the time of discharge.  The patient then
received two more units of PRBCs on [**2116-4-14**] for symptomatic
treatment.  A colonoscopy had been performed about one year ago
which had shown sigmoid diverticulosis.  The patient was
counseled at discharge to continue to monitor for recurrence of
melena, worsening shortness of breath, pre-syncope, or chest
pain.  If his GI bleed should recur, the patient should be
considered for enteroscopy to further evaluate the small bowel
if the capsule endoscopy proves to be unremarkable, as an EGD
has already been performed.  A tagged red cell scan and
