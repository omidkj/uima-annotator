Service:  MICU/SICU
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 81 year old
woman with a history of multiple recent admissions, seen by
her primary care physician, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 12041**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 5361**], on [**2165-10-14**] with a left foot ulcer, anemia and hyperkalemia.  She
eventually required a below the knee amputation on [**10-22**],
by a rash believed to be secondary to Unasyn, anemia with
chronic occult blood positive stools, and status post
multiple packed red blood cell transfusions.  She also has a
history of prerenal azotemia.

The patient returned on [**2165-11-10**] with congestive
heart failure and hyperkalemia.  A transthoracic
enlargement with mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy
with a left ventricular ejection fraction of greater than
55%.  Right ventricular dilatation and hypokinesis was noted,
with 1 to 2+ tricuspid regurgitation.  These findings were
found to be consistent with cor pulmonale.  A CT scan of the
chest showed no evidence of pulmonary embolus but
ground-glass opacities and right-sided pleural fluid, that
was treated with diuresis.  She was scheduled for outpatient
pulmonary follow-up and had been treated with Diflucan for
[**Female First Name (un) 564**] in her urine.

The patient was found to be unresponsive on [**2165-12-1**]
at her nursing home.  She had been noted to have loose stools
and dysuria and was found to have a bandemia on her complete
blood count.  She was diagnosed with a urinary tract
infection as well as Clostridium difficile colitis.  She was
returned to her nursing home on levofloxacin and
metronidazole.

The patient reportedly was doing well until she was noted
with mental status changes.  She was found to have a oxygen
saturation of 64% on three liters.  Emergency medical service
was activated.  The patient was saturating 99% on ten liters
face mask and sent to the Emergency Room at [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 3867**]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **].

At the [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 3867**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] Emergency Room,
the patient was found to be without symptoms and told
physicians that she was just sleeping.  She has felt feverish
with sweats, but had no chills.  She had some chest pain
following dinner, that resolved with an antacid.  She denies
palpitations, shortness of breath or pleurisy.  She had an
occasional nonproductive cough.

The patient was admitted to the medical service and worked up
for her pulmonary hypertension.  This included initiation of
a pulmonary consult as well as the performance of a
therapeutic thoracentesis.  A diagnosed thoracentesis had
shown this fluid to be likely a transudate.

On [**2165-12-9**], the patient had a therapeutic
thoracentesis performed until ultrasound guidance.
Approximately 800 cc of fluid was removed.

Upon return to the floor, the patient was found to have an
oxygen saturation in the low 60% range and the patient
complained of being shortness of breath.  Arterial blood
gases at that time showed a pH of 7.20, pCO2 99 and pO2 67 on
100% nonrebreather face mask.  The patient complained of
shortness of breath but no chest pain.  Her blood pressure
was in the 130s and pulse in the 80s.  Her examination
revealed equal breath sounds bilaterally.  A chest x-ray
showed edema, right greater than left, with no evidence of
pneumothorax.

Anesthesia was called stat, the patient was sedated and
paralyzed with succinylcholine and etomidate, was intubated
with a 7.5 French endotracheal tube, with some difficulty
passing the cords noted.  Mild to moderate pink frothy
secretions were noted from the endotracheal tube.  She
remained hemodynamically stable and was transferred to the
Medical/Surgical Intensive Care Unit for further care.

Shortly after arrival to the Intensive Care Unit, the patient
became bradycardiac in the 30s.  She was administered
intravenous Atropine 1 mg times one.  The patient then lost
her pulse.  Cardiopulmonary resuscitation was initiated and
intravenous epinephrine 1 mg given.  Her rhythm, shortly
thereafter, showed what appeared to be ventricular
tachycardia and then ventricular fibrillation.  One sternal
thumb was administered, followed by cardioversion at 200
joules.

The patient's subsequent rhythm was a narrow complex
tachycardia in the 150s, which gradually slowed to the 100s
with a blood pressure in the 200 systolic range.  A left
femoral central line and a left radial arterial line were
placed.  Amiodarone intravenous load was begun but stopped
secondary to hypotension to the 70s that required initiation
of Dopamine.  A chest x-ray subsequently showed a right main
stem bronchus intubation.  Electrocardiogram showed no
changes compared with prior tracings.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is a nonsmoker and denies
alcohol use.  She lives in a nursing home.  According to the
hospital attending, Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) **], the patient is a

that the patient had stated that she wished only to be on
maximal support only if there were "reversible causes" over a
short period of time.

effusion at right base; appearance of air bronchograms in
this region, though difficult to tell as the patient is

history of right heart failure, pulmonary hypertension and
cor pulmonale, who was admitted to the Medical/Surgical
Intensive Care Unit on [**2165-12-9**] after respiratory
