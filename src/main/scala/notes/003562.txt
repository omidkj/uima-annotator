HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 76-year-old gentleman
with history of aortic valve replacement, mitral valve
replacement both bioprosthetic valve, status post 1 vessel
CABG for 3 vessel coronary artery disease back in [**2144**], who
presents to [**Hospital1 18**] [**Hospital6 3872**] for further
evaluation and treatment of his coronary artery disease,
severe mitral regurgitation.  The patient recently presented
to his cardiologist, Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 1075**], with gradually worsening
shortness of breath with exertion over the last 12 months,
more significantly over the last 2 to 3 months.  The patient
previously has been able to walk "three telephone poles "
distance before dyspnea.  Now, the patient reports that he
gets dyspneic with less than one-half of that distance.  The
patient also reports that he feels winded after 1 to 5
stairs.  He denies history of chest pain, paroxysmal
nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, lower extremity edema,
palpitations, syncope or lightheadedness.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  On further review of systems, he denies
recent illness, injury, no recent fevers, chills, nausea,
vomiting, diarrhea, melena, hematochezia, dysuria, hematuria,
rash or headache.  Cardiac catheterization at [**Hospital6 31672**] on [**2157-5-24**], showed three-vessel coronary
artery disease, distal LAD with tapered occlusion, (left
circumflex 90 percent, AV groove, occluded OM, OM-SVG, 85
percent at proximal RCA).  In addition, a cardiac
catheterization showed left ventricular dysfunction at 25
percent with global hypokinesis and apical akinesis,
dysfunctional bioprosthetic mitral valve replacement with
moderate to severe regurgitation and moderate mitral
stenosis.  The catheterization did reveal that the aortic
valve replacement was functional and there was trace aortic
insufficiency.  The patient was referred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further
treatment.  On the day of admission, [**2157-6-1**], the patient
had cardiac catheterization done here, which showed SVG to OM
totally occluded, RCA with severe disease, right atrial
pressure of 17, pulmonary catheter wedge pressure 36/65/37;
pulmonary artery pressure 85/32; cardiac index 2.54;
peripheral vascular distance at 346.  A pulmonary artery
catheter was placed in the cardiac cath lab after the patient
had two stents deployed in his right coronary artery.
Postcatheterization on arrival to the coronary intensive care
unit, the patient was feeling well without complaints.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Ischemic coronary artery disease.
Mitral stenosis, status post mitral valve replacement in
[**2149**].  Aortic stenosis, status post aortic valve replacement,
both bioprosthetic valves.
Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.
Hypertension.
Pneumonia.
Status post right hip replacement.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives with his wife.  [**Name (NI) **] is a

Korean War veteran.  He was stationed in [**Country 2784**] during the
war.  He never smoked.  He has never drunken a beer in his
life, no other alcohol use.  No history of illicit drug use.

[**Last Name (STitle) 56412**]SPITAL COURSE:  This 76-year-old man status post
bioprosthetic AVR and MVR now status post catheter since the
RCA, three-vessel disease, elevated pulmonary artery pressure
secondary to severe mitral regurgitation was admitted for
trial of vasodilators and diuresis, in hopes of optimization
of clinical status for consideration of mitral valve
replacement by Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) **].

Pu[**Last Name (STitle) **]y artery hypertension, mitral valve regurgitation:
The patient was started on a trial of Nipride, which the
patient tolerated well with significant reduction of his
pulmonary artery pressures.  The initial upon readings for
pulmonary artery pressure 85/32 with a mean of 48, which
reduced to pulmonary artery pressure of 34/12 with a mean of
20 after nitroprusside.  The patient's SVR also decreased
significantly from 1008 to 744 on the Nipride.  His pulmonary
vascular resistance also decreased significantly from 346 to
160 on Nipride.  His pulmonary capillary wedge pressure
decreased from 37 to 15 on Nipride.  The patient tolerated
the trial of Nipride well.  However, the patient's systolic
blood pressure did drop somewhat with the Nipride drip, which
was held secondary to hypotension after 12 hours of Nipride
therapy.  After discussion with the patient, the decision was
made to transition the patient from Nipride to nesiritide for
conservative afterload reduction until mitral valve
replacement.  The patient was diuresed significantly with
nesiritide and Lasix.  The team felt that the patient was
diuresed to euvolemia given that his creatinine increased from
1.4 to 1.9 on the day of discharge.  Discussion was held with
the patient and his wife as well as with Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) **]
regarding whether or not to keep the patient inpatient until
mitral valve replacement could be done or readmit the patient
to optimize his medical condition for possible surgery at a
later date. The
patient preferred to go home given that Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) **]
cannot do his mitral valve replacement until next week.
Therefore, the patient was discharged home on his
home medications with one change.  The patient's atenolol was
felt to be too high of a dose for the patient.  He was noted
to be hypotensive to a map of 55 to 60 and the heart rate in
the 50s on this atenolol dose of 50 mg q.a.m. and 25 q.h.s.
Therefore, the atenolol dose was decreased to 25 mg b.i.d.
The patient was advised that he felt dizzy or lightheaded
that he should discontinue his p.m. atenolol dose after
talking with his cardiologist, Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 1075**].

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:  Congestive heart failure.
Severe mitral valve regurgitation.
Hypertension.
Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.
Reversible pulmonary artery hypertension.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Stable.
