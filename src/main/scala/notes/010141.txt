Chest X-ray Study Date of [**2191-8-3**] 7:09 AM COMPARISON: [**2191-8-1**].
UPRIGHT CHEST RADIOGRAPH: An endotracheal tube, left-sided
internal jugular central venous line, and nasogastric tube are
appropriately positioned. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is
unchanged. Mild pulmonary edema is improving. There is a small
right-sided pleural effusion. The left-sided pleural effusion is
less evident on this upright chest radiograph.
IMPRESSION:
1. Improving pulmonary edema.
2. Small bilateral pleural effusions.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.


CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2191-8-1**] 10:16 AM
FINDINGS: The moderate left pleural effusion is stable. Mild
right pleural
effusion and minimal pulmonary edema is also stable. The heart
size is
within limits. The endotracheal tube is 4 cm from the carina in
satisfactory location.
IMPRESSION:
1. Stable moderate left pleural effusion.
2. Stable mild right pleural effusion and adjacent right
pulmonary edema.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.


ECG Study Date of [**2191-7-28**]  2:04:50 PM

Consider left atrial abnormality
Generalized low voltage
These findings are nonspecific but clinical correlation is

Brief Hospital Course:
This 74-year-old gentleman underwent repair of a ruptured
abdominal aortic aneurysm 12 years ago. He was recently admitted
to the emergency room at another hospital
with abdominal pain and found to have a 5.5 cm aneurysm of the
visceral segment of his abdominal aorta starting at about the
level of the celiac artery and ending at the previously-placed
graft. Most of the aneurysmal portion of the aorta was
posterior with relatively normal looking aorta anteriorly. He
was advised to have repair he agreed to have the procedure done.

[**2191-7-28**] Patient was admitted via holding room to Vascular
Surgery/Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] service. Patient was taken to OR and had
a successful resection and repair of abdominal aortic aneurysm.
Patient was intubated, sedated post-operatively, transferred to
CVICU for recovery. Patient was transfused 2 units FFP and 2
units PRBC for EBL of 2500 cc intra-op. Fluid resuscitated.
Epidural was placed for pain control.

[**2191-7-29**] Remains in CVICU, intubated, sedated, more fluid
rescusitation. Vital signs stable. Low urine output. Good pain
control with epidural. Routine labs and electrolytes repleted.
Noted to have mild thrombocytopenia-no intervention, monitored.
RISS for blodd sugar control.

[**2191-7-30**] Remains in CVICU, intubated- with moderate metabolic
acidosis, slightly sedated. Moderately tachycardic and
hypertensive place on Nitro drip and Lopressor IV.

[**2191-7-31**] Remains in CVICU, slightly sedated, intubated-weaning to
CPAP, then as tolerated. Remains on Nitro drip and Lopressor IV
for BP and HR control. Hydralazine IV was added for increasing
hypertension. PO meds resumed via NGT.

[**2191-8-1**] Remains in CVICU, slightly sedated-weaning, intubated-
continued vent wean. Patient had increased work of breathing,
remains to have low urine output, and T maxed 101.4. Remains on
Nitro and lopressor. Started to diurese with Lasix-responded
well. Started on Vanco and Aztreonam.

[**2191-8-2**] Remains in CVICU, slightly sedated-weaned off. Low grade
temp. Making good urine output, creatinine rising- continue to
diurese and watch creatinine. Sputum grew Enterobacter-continue
Vanco and Aztreonam. Tube feeds started and tolerating-titrating
to goal.

[**2191-8-3**] Remains in CVICU, intubated-on CPAP-plan to extubate.
Off sedation, now trying to follow commands. Afebrile, VSS on
current meds. Vanco and Aztreonam changed to Cipro for the
Enterobacter in sputum. Remains on metoprolol IV. Tolerating
tube feeds now at goal. Continue to diurese.

[**2191-8-4**] Remains in CVICU, remains intubated-continue weaning.
MAE, following commands. Now autodiuresing. Afebrile, still
