Chief Complaint:
left sided weakness

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Endotracheal intubation

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 7860**] is a 78 female with a history of hypertension and
hypercholesteremia who was playing cards with her friends at
2:30PM when she developed left sided facial droop, dysarthria,
and left sided weakness.  EMS was called and on arrival her HR
was 80, BP 190/98, RR 20, and pupils 3mm. She was following
commands but left arm and leg were noted to not be moving.

She was brought to [**Hospital1 1474**] ED where a head CT was done and she
was found to have a 2x2.5cm right basal ganglia hemorrhage. She
was given Ativan 4mg and Dilantin 1gm for seizure prophylaxis.
Daughter-in-law who was talking to her stated that she was
completely coherent and able to provide who her health care
proxy was as well as details of her symptoms.  She was then
given Lidocaine 100mg, Etomidate 20mg, Succ 150mg, Dilaudid 1mg,
and apparently electively intubated at 15:30.  She has not
received any sedation since. She was also given Labetelol 20mg,
which brought her SBP down to 160s. She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]
for further management.


Past Medical History:
diabetes- diet controlled.
hypertension- sees her PCP q3mos for BP checks.
peripheral neuropathy- unknown etiology
hypercholesterolemia
hypothyroidism
stress incontinence  goes to her PCP


Social History:
She lives by herself.  She has some pain and gait instability
from her neuropathy and uses a cane.


Family History:
Father died of an abdominal aneurysm, mother died of [**Name (NI) 11964**]
in 80s.

Pertinent Results:
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2129-1-6**] 5:35 PM
FINDINGS: There is an approximately 2.7 x 2.2 cm focus of
hyperdensity centered in the right basal ganglia and consistent
with hemorrhage. There is a small hypodense rim surrounding the
hemorrhage indicating vasogenic edema. There may be mild
effacement of the right lateral ventricle. There is no
intraventricular extension of hemorrhage. There is no
appreciable shift of normally midline structures. There is no
evidence of hydrocephalus or acute major vascular territorial
infarction. Small amount of fluid in the right maxillary sinus.
The mastoid air cells are clear. There is no concerning osseous
lesion or fracture.

IMPRESSION:
1. Intraparenchymal hemorrhage appears to be centered in the
right basal ganglia and probably hypertensive in etiology. No
definite underlying mass.
2. Small amount of fluid in right maxillary sinus.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2129-1-8**] 10:20 AM
One portable view. Comparison with [**2129-1-6**]. There is motion
artifact. There is increased density at the right base
suspicious for pneumonia. Additional streaky density at the left
base probably represents subsegmental atelectasis, although a
small area of consolidation on that side cannot be excluded. The
cardiac silhouette is prominent as before. The aorta is tortuous
and calcified. Mediastinal structures are unchanged. The patient
has been extubated and a nasogastric tube has been removed.

IMPRESSION: Development of increased density at the right base
suspicious for pneumonia.

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2129-1-13**] 10:03 AM
Accounting for differences in technique and positioning between
the two studies, no significant change in the right basal
ganglion hemorrhage with surrounding edema is seen. There is
effacement of the right lateral ventricle. No significant
midline shift is seen. No new hemorrhages are seen.

Extensive intracranial vascular calcification is seen.

Visualized paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are clear.

IMPRESSION: Stable right basal ganglion hemorrhage.

UNILAT UP EXT VEINS US  [**2129-1-12**] 3:25 PM
LEFT UPPER EXTREMITY VENOUS ULTRASOUND: Grayscale and Doppler
son[**Name (NI) **] of the left internal jugular, subclavian, axillary,
brachial, basilic and cephalic veins were performed. Normal
flow, augmentation, compressibility and waveforms are
demonstrated. No intraluminal thrombus is identified.

IMPRESSION: No left upper extremity DVT.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2129-1-14**] 1:37 PM
FINDINGS: New right PICC line terminates in the superior vena
cava. Cardiac silhouette remains enlarged, but bilateral
interstitial pattern suggestive of edema shows interval
improvement. Patchy parenchymal opacities at both lung bases are
also slightly improving, and may be due to improving aspiration
pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting.


Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 7860**] is a 78 year old woman with hypertension and
diabetes mellitis who presented with sudden onset left sided
weakness. Her hospital course is delineated by problem as
follows:

1) Right Basal Ganglia Hemorrhage:
Given the location of the hemorrhage, it was thought to be
related to chronic hypertension. She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]
from another facility and admitted to the neurology ICU for
blood pressure and neurologic monitoring. The patient arrived
intubated and sedated on several medications. She was not given
further sedatives or NM blocking agents. The head of the bed was
elevated > 30 degrees. Aspirin and other anticoagulants were
intially held. She was proptly extubated on HD #1 and tolerated
O2 via face mask. She became febrile and was noted to have RLL
infiltrate by CXR. Her neurologic exam steadily improved off
sedatives. She was noted to have mild encephalopathy on HD #4
which resolved as her fevers resolved with treatment of her
pneumonia. Her Left sided hemiparesis showed signs of steady
improvement with Left leg 4+ strength and left arm [**2-16**] at time
of discharge. Still with L NL effacement and resulting
dysarthria. Hypertension proved difficult to control with
multiple agents. The patient was maximized on three agents and
continues to be titrated on nitrates as well as hydralazine.
SBP's at time of discharge ranged from 150's to 170's. Given her
chronic hypertension, her blood pressure medications should
continue to be slowly titrated to goal SBP < 130 over the next
few weeks. She was started on pyridoxine while on hydralazine.
TSH was checked and normal. If following > four drugs at maximum
dose, other secondary causes of hypertension should be
considered.

The patient will follow up with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 2530**] [**Name (STitle) **] in [**5-22**] weeks.
She should remain off aspirin until follow up. Given her other
stroke risk factors she may benefit from daily aspirin therapy.
The risks and benefits should be considered during follow up
with any further imaging for stratification of recurrent
bleeding risk on antiplatelet therapy (pt was not previously on
ASA).

2) Hospital Acquired Pneumonia:
Pt noted to have RLL infiltrate in setting of fevers and
leucocytosis following intubation from an outside hospital. She
was treated with Ceftazidime and Vancomyc
