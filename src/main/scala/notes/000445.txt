She was transferred to the CCU, where she was found to be
hypothermic, has an elevated Lactate, and was hypotensive
requiring 4 pressors and fluids wide-open. Her neuro exam
revealed loss corneal and gag reflexes. Surgery was consulted
about possible abdominal process at the etiology of her septic
shock, but surgery felt that given her unstable picture and
neurological impairements that surgery was not indicated. Her
husband and son were notified, and it was felt that the
patient's wishes were not to have aggressive measures. After
discussion with the family and medical team, it was decided to
withdraw care. Pressors were stopped, her ventilation was weaned
