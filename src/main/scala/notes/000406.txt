SOCIAL HISTORY:  No history of tobacco or alcohol.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Pulse 85.  Blood pressure 95/69.
Respiratory rate 24.  96% oxygen saturation on 4 liters.
General, the patient is an elderly female in no acute
distress.  Neck JVP 10 cm.  HEENT mucous membranes are moist.
Extraocular movements intact.  Left eye lateral abduction.
Cardiac sounds obscured by increased rhonchi.  Pulmonary
diffuse rhonchi and wheezing.  Abdomen positive bowel sounds,
soft.  Extremities bilateral lower extremity 1+ pitting
edema, 1+ bilateral dorsalis pedis pulses.

LABORATORY:  The patient was hyponatremic with a sodium of
127 and acute elevation of her creatinine to 1.2 from .7.
Chest x-ray showed bibasilar opacities bilaterally.
Pulmonary edema infiltrate, versus atelectasis.
Electrocardiogram showed ST elevation in V1 through V3.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to [**Hospital1 346**] on [**2163-4-15**] and initially treated
medically by the Medicine Service.  She was started on
Levaquin for pneumonia.  She was started on aspirin, heparin
drip, beta blocker for her myocardial infarction.  The
patient also received Lasix for her acute congestive heart
failure exacerbation.  Cardiology was involved in the
patient's care.  An echocardiogram was performed, which
showed an ejection fraction of less then 20%.  Cardiac
catheterization was also performed showing mitral
regurgitation, left ventricular ejection fraction of 25%,
global hypokinesis, 1+ mitral regurgitation, right dominant
coronary angiography LMCA calcified plaque 40% proximally,
left anterior descending coronary artery diffuse 70% long
proximal calcified, Dig okay, left circumflex moderate distal
right coronary artery 70%, osteal 95% mid lesion.  The
patient was taken to the Operating Room on [**2163-4-21**] where a
coronary artery bypass graft times four and aortic valve
replacement was performed.  The patient was left with a chest
tube and pacing wires in place.  She required immediately
postoperatively epinephrine and Propofol drips.

The first postoperative day she was noted overnight to have
ventricular ectopy for which she received Amiodarone.  The
patient received Vancomycin times four perioperatively for
prophylaxis.  She was started on beta blockers and Lasix at
the appropriate time.  At the appropriate time the patient's
pacing wires and chest tubes were removed.  She was stopped
from her various drips when appropriate.  The patient was
also shown to have a wide complex tachycardia at times per
cardiologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  The patient was sent out of the
Intensive Care Unit when appropriate on Lasix, Captopril and
Lopressor as well as Amiodarone.  Due to the patient's age
and stability it was determined by her cardiologist that
Coumadin probably would not be an appropriate course of
therapy due to significant risks.  Once the patient was on
the floor when of her major issues was blood pressure control
for which her blood pressure medications were progressively
increased.  Physical therapy saw the patient on repeated
occasions and believed the patient would do well at a rehab
facility.  It is now [**2163-4-29**] and the patient is in stable
condition.  It is likely that she will be discharged today or
tomorrow for rehab.  The patient may shower, but should not
take baths.  The patient is to avoid strenuous activity.  The
patient should not drive while on pain medication.  She is to
follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1537**] in four weeks.  She is to follow up
with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 449**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 11139**] in one to two weeks and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in two
to three weeks.  She will be discharged on Lopressor 50 mg po
b.i.d., Captopril 37.5 mg po t.i.d., Reglan 10 mg q 6,
Timolol .5% one drop OD b.i.d., _____________ 2%, Timolol .5%
