Brief Hospital Course:
This patient was a 79 year-old female with a past medical
history of malignant B-cell lymphoma (S05-[**Numeric Identifier 96750**]) and s/p two
cycles of chemotherapy, type II diabetes, hypertension, remote
axillo-femoral bypass graft, and anemia of chronic disease.
She was initially seen at [**Hospital6 310**] and was
transferred to [**Hospital3 **] on [**2189-5-16**] for further
evaluation of shortness of breath that began one day prior to
admission.  An echocardiogram performed in [**2189-3-22**] had shown
an ejection fraction of 60% and impaired left ventricular (LV)
filling. A chest X-ray on admission was consistent with
congestive heart failure (CHF).  She was treated with furosemide
but continued to require oxygen. She was transferred to the ICU
for further management. Her shortness of breath (SOB) continued
to worsen and CXR showed worsening bilateral pulmonary edema and
increase in the size of pleural effusions.  The patient was
empirically started on antibiotics. A repeat echocardiogram
revealed an EF of 50-55% and mild LV dysfunction.  She initially
improved with antibiotic therapy and diuretics however her
respiratory status began to worsen again and she was febrile
several days later.  Blood cultures were negative.  The patient
agreed to have VATS; however the patient developed a
pneumothorax as a result of a right subclavian central line
placement.  A chest tube was inserted and the VATS was postponed
pending clinical improvement.  She continued to worsen and
required intubation on [**2189-5-26**].  The patient failed to improve
and expired on [**2189-5-27**].
