Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 61807**] was admitted on [**2195-6-2**] for preoperative evaluation.
 He was noted to have an elevated INR at 1.5, which was
consistent with previous data. A hematology consult was obtained
and it was decided that the patient had vitamin K deficiency and
there was no need for further intervention.  His INR decreased
to 1.3 and he was taken to the operating room with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
on [**2195-6-9**] for AVR and replacement of his ascending aorta with
a 23mm aortic valve homograft with coronary reimplantation.
Please see operative note for full details.  He was transferred
to the ICU in stable condition.  He was slow to awake but was
following commands on POD#1, and was extubated on POD#2. He was
transferred to the regular floor on POD#3.  He developed rapid
atrial fibrillation on POD#4.  He was found to be hypoxic with
labored breathing.  He was transferred back to the ICU and
required reintubation.  Bronchoscopy showed copious secretions
which showed oropharyngeal flora.  He was extubated on POD#6.  A
pulmonary consult was obtained and it was recommended to use
intermittent BiPAP and diuresis.  He underwent therapeutic
thoracentesis of the right chest on POD#8, and still required
intermittent BiPAP to maintain adequate ventilation. On POD# 9
he was noted to have a swollen left upper extremity and an
ultrasound showed thrombus in the left internal jugular and left
subclavian.  He was started on heparin for anticoagulation.  He
underwent thoracentesis of the left chest on POD#10.  On POD#12
he was re intubated for worsening respiratory status and
respiratory acidosis with mental status changes.  A neurology
consult was obtained and he had a CT scan and MRI which were
negative for any acute process, as well as an EEG which was
negative for any seizure activity, and showed mild diffuse
slowing consistent with encephalopathy.  It was thought that the
mental status changes were due to metabolic encephalopathy, he
was started on Coumadin.  On POD#15 a pulmonary medicine consult
was again obtained and it was recommended that the patient be
allowed to have a compensatory metabolic alkalosis, and continue
BiPAP and aggressive pulmonary toilet.  He was again extubated
and required almost continuous BiPAP to maintain adequate
ventilation.  It was determined that the patient would benefit
from a tracheostomy and he was electively re intubated prior to
the procedure and underwent percutaneous tracheostomy on POD#20.
 Pulmonary medicine recommended continuing empiric antibiotics
for a presumed ventilator associated pneumonia. He was noted to
have a L inguinal hernia that was un reducible.  A general
surgery consult was obtained and and it was decided that no
intervention was needed at this time.  He was cleared for
discharge to rehab
