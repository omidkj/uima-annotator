History of Present Illness:
74F with hx of dementia, schizophrenia and recent T12
compression fx who presented to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**7-18**] with placcid
paralysis and found to have cord compression. Per notes, pt fell
on [**6-19**] and since then has had persistent back pain and refuses
to move leg. Patient was reportedly ambulating with cane prior
to fall. Lumbarsacral spine and pelvis Xray at that point was
negative for fracture. Patient then noted to have decreased Hct
and Na. Given long history of smoking, CT chest done on [**7-13**] for
malignancy workup. It showed nonpathologic compression T12
fracture. It also showed RLL consolidation for which she
completed treatment of levaquin for 7 d. On day of admission, pt
presented with flaccid paralysis. MR T spine show severe T12
compression fracture with retropulsed fragment causing severe
canal stenosis, concerning for cord compression. Patient
recieved steroids in ED and was admitted to the medicine
service.

Physical Exam:
temp 98, BP 151/77, HR 106, R 33, O2 97% on NRB
Gen: elderly female in moderate resp distress, grunting
occasionally, using some accessory muscles
HEENT: MM dry, EOMI, pupils dilated, reactive to light
CV: heart sounds not heard [**2-10**] rhoncherous breath souds
Chest: no crackles at bases, exp wheezes bilaterally; chest tube
in left side
Abd: hypoactive bowel sounds, nontender, soft
Sacrum: small 2cm area of erythema
Ext: 2+ DP, no edema
Neuro: AO x 2 (not to place), CN 2-12 intact, 4+/5 strength in
upper ext, won't move lower ext; ? decreased sensation in lower
ext; 1+ DTRs in lower ext, 2+ DTRs in upper ext; Babinski

Pertinent Results:
CXR: Persistent left retrocardiac opacity and left pleural
effusion.
.
Echo on [**2107-7-19**]:
The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. Regional left
ventricular wall motion is normal. Left ventricular systolic
function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%). Right ventricular chamber
size and free wall motion are normal. The ascending aorta is
mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Mild (1+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The left
ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation.
Transmitral Doppler and tissue velocity imaging are consistent
with Grade I (mild) left ventricular diastolic dysfunction. The
estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is
no pericardial effusion.
.
MR L SPINE SCAN  [**2107-7-17**]
Compression fracture at T12 with severe canal compromise. This
is incompletely imaged on this examination and the thoracic
spine MR should be obtained.

Distended bladder could be due to cord compression.
.
MR CONTRAST GADOLIN  [**2107-7-18**]
Compression of the T12 vertebral body with large retropulsed
osseous fragment resulting in marked cord compression and cord
edema at the level of compression and in the conus. There are
some features of the compression which raise the possibility of
this being a pathologic fracture rather than a simple
insufficiency fracture.
.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2107-7-19**] 10:48 PM
The endotracheal tube previously in the right main bronchus has
been repositioned to standard placement at the level of the
sternal notch and, accordingly, the previously collapsed left
lung has reexpanded. A pleural tube projects over the base of
the left chest. There is no pneumothorax or appreciable pleural
effusion. Heart is top normal size. There is engorgement of
hilar and pulmonary vasculature suggesting borderline cardiac
dysfunction or volume overload. Tip of the left subclavian
catheter projects over the upper SVC. Nasogastric tube ends in
the stomach.
.
CHEST PORT. LINE PLACEMENT  [**2107-7-19**] 9:45 PM
Total collapse of the left lung secondary to ET tube tip in the
right main bronchus.

Right basal consolidation.

Small left basilar pneumothorax.

Left subclavian line tip in the SVC.
.
T12 VERTEBRAL BODY R/O TUMOR Pathology:
Bone with focal necrosis, reactive changes, intramedullary fat
necrosis and granulation tissue consistent with healing
fracture.
Hyaline cartilage.
No osteomyelitis seen.
No evidence of malignancy.
.
BILAT LOWER EXT VEINS PORT  [**2107-7-21**] 1:28 AM
BILATERAL LOWER EXTREMITY VENOUS ULTRASOUND: [**Doctor Last Name **] scale and
Doppler son[**Name (NI) 1417**] of the bilateral common femoral, superficial
femoral and popliteal veins were performed. These demonstrate
normal compressibility, flow, augmentation, and waveforms. No
intraluminal thrombus identified.

IMPRESSION: No evidence of bilateral lower extremity DVT.
.
EKG  [**2107-8-7**]:
Baseline artifact. Rhythm is most likely sinus tachycardia. ST
segment
elevation in leads VI-V2. Q waves in leads VI-V3. Findings
suggest anteroseptal myocardial infarction/injury of
undetermined age. There are also lateral ST segment depressions
suggestive of myocardial ischemia. Clinical correlation is
suggested. Compared to the previous tracing of 7 14-06 anterior
and anterolateral abnormalities persist.
.
ECHO [**2107-8-9**]:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric
left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and systolic
function
(LVEF>55%), without regional wall motion abnormalities. Tissue
velocity
imaging E/e' is elevated (>15) suggesting increased left
ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
present. Mild to moderate ([**1-10**]+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
There is an  anterior space which most likely represents a fat
pad, though a loculated anterior pericardial effusion cannot be
excluded.

IMPRESSION: Symmetric LVH with preserved global and regional
biventricular systolic function. Mild-to-moderate aortic
regurgitation.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2107-7-19**],
the findings appear similar.
