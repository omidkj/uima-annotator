size.  The bony thorax is normal. IMPRESSION:  Left lower lobe

.


Brief Hospital Course:
1. GI bleed: at admission, the patient underwent banding of
grade 2 varices.  Her hematocrit remained stable and she was
transferred to the floor.  She had a repeat endoscopy during the
admission with repeat banding of the varices.  She was on
sucralfate and PPI. She will have subsequent endoscopies and
banding as an outpatient.
.
2. Alcoholic liver disease: the patient had a new diagnosis of
alcoholic liver disease and likely cirrhosis. She did not
undergo liver biopsy during this admission.  She has marked
hepatomegaly and splenomegaly, ascites and esophageal varices.
Her course was complicated by alcoholic hepatitis. Her
discriminate function was 36, however, she was not a candidate
for steroids given the recent GI bleed and infection (see
below).  She had prolonged abdominal distention and pain (see
below) despite improvement in her LFTs.  She underwent three
paracenteses and was started on diuretics to control her fluid
accumulation.  There was no evidence of SBP.  Her relatively low
blood pressure limited the dose of diuretics.  She will have
liver center follow up as an outpatient.  The patient was
actively drinking prior to admission.  HBsAb neg, HAV neg, anti
smooth muscle antibody neg, IgG 1406. IgA 540 (elevated).
Ceruloplasmin negative.
.
3. Pain: the patient suffered from chronic abdominal pain which
was difficult to control. Her pain was severe despite resolution
of her alcoholic hepatitis.  CT scan did not have evidence of
liver bleed or abscess or other anatomic reason for her pain.
She required high doses of narcotics for pain control, and
denied (repeatedly) ever using narcotics before.  It was
suspected that her pain was from capsular stretch from
hepatomegaly.  Ultimately, pain service was involved and she was
put on 30 mg Oxycontin twice daily with oxycodone for
breakthrough and Neurontin. This regimen provided improved pain
control.  The patient has an addiction (alcohol) history and
attempts to wean her narcotics were unsuccessful.  At discharge,
the patient was given Oxycontin 40 mg [**Hospital1 **] and prn oxycodone for
breakthrough and Neurontin.  She was given 2 weeks of narcotics
and was told she needs to see her PCP for chronic narcotic
management.
.
4. Community acquired pneumonia: the patient was diagnosed with
pneumonia at admission. She completed 10 days of Levoquin and 7
days of Flagyl. The patient continued to spike fevers during her
prolonged hospitalization.  Repeat xray showed no infiltrate.
.
5. UTI: group A strep urinary infection treated with four days
of Augmentin with subsequent clean culture. The patient
continued to spike fevers and Ceftriaxone was added to her
regimen to complete at 10 day course for the UTI in this patient
with liver disease.  The patient was transferred to Cefpodoxime
at discharge.
.
6. Alcohol abuse/addiction: the patient was actively drinking
prior to admission. She has a long history of alcohol use with
[**2-25**] drinks of wine daily.  She was seen by addiction services
and social work during this hospitalization and was given
material regarding alcoholics annonymous and other abstinence
programs.  There was also a strong suspicion of outpatient
Vicodin abuse given overheard conversations between the patient
and her husband, however, this was denied repeatedly on direct
questioning.  The patient displayed drug-seeking behaviors while
inpatient. She was repeatedly informed that she can no longer
drink alcohol and verbalized understanding.
.
7. Hypertension: the patient had a history of hypertension prior
to admission, but her blood pressure tended to run low during
this hospitalization. It is likely that this is related to lack
of alcohol while hospitalized and pain medication. The patient
also was started on Nadolol for her varices, but was unable to
tolerate this in addition to the doses of Lasix and Aldactone
needed to control her abdominal distention.
.
8. Hypothyroidism: continued outpatient levoxyl.
.
9.  Disposition: the patient was discharged home to complete a
10 day course of Cefpodoxime. She was given a prescription for 2
weeks of narcotics and will follow up with her PCP.  [**Name10 (NameIs) **] has
close liver center follow up. She had been cleared by PT for
going home. She requires daily magnesium repletion.  She was
full code.
