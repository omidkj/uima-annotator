Pertinent Results:
[**2151-6-28**] Echo: Prebypass: Very poor images of the ascending aorta.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). with
mild global RV free wall hypokinesis. The aortic root is
moderately dilated at the sinus level. A mechanical aortic valve
prosthesis is present. Motion of the aortic valve prosthesis
leaflets/discs is abnormal. There is dehiscence noted of the
prosthetic aortic valve.Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The leaflets are
tethered. No obvious vegetatiion seen on the mitral valve.
Severe (4+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid
regurgitation is seen. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in person of the
results on [**2151-6-28**] at 930am. Post bypass: Patient is AV paced
and receiving an infusion of levophed, milrinone, vasopressin
and epinephrine. LVEF= 40%. RV mildly hypokinetic. Mechanical
valve seen in the aortic position. With limited views it appears
well seated and the leaflets move well. Annuloplasty ring seen
in the mitral position. It appears well seated but there is 2+
mitral regurgitation. The moderate to severe tricuspid
regurgitation persists. Unable to visualize the aorta completely
post decannulation.
[**2151-7-7**] Liver U/S: Cholelithiasis without evidence of acute
cholecystitis. Small right pleural effusion. Limited exam.
[**2151-7-9**] Abd MRI: 1. Gallstone within the gallbladder, without
evidence of acute cholecystitis. 2. The common bile duct and
intrahepatic bile ducts are of normal caliber with no evidence
of obstruction. 3. Significant subcutaneous emphysema (which has
been present on recent chest radiographs.
