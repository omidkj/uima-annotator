Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7055**]
Chief Complaint:
Atrial fibrillation refractory to cardioversion

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
 80yo M with history of longstanding CAD (s/p triple bypass
19yrs ago), EF of 15-20%, DMII, paroxismal AF (s/p multiple
cardioversion, most recent one [**11-2**]) transferred from [**Hospital1 4494**] for ablation.
.
The patient was last discharged s/p cardioversion on [**10-26**]. He
felt well for several days, then began to feel dizzy (his usual
afib symptoms, he feels well while not in afib all the time). He
also felt short of breath. He decided to visit Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 7756**] who
admitted him to [**Hospital3 3765**] for cardioversion.
.
At [**Hospital3 3765**] Vitals were 190/88 P 100 RR 26 T-97.6 - 80%
RA
HE was given Lasix 80 yesterday, 40 today and diuresed 1 Liter.
He was placed on Oxygen, and also given dobutamine.
Cardioversion was completed but ultimately failed and he was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for possible ablation as well as diuresis.
.
Of note, On last admission to [**Hospital1 18**] the patient was in severe
biventricular failure and was diuresed, started on Dofetilide
for 3 days,  and then was cardioverted into sinus rhythm with
DDD pacing. He was sent home on  Dofetilide 125 mcg b.i.d. in
addition to his heart failure regime. The plan then was if he
goes back into Afib to bring him in and to ablate him as there
is no more pharmacologic options.
.
On review of systems, He denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the

time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains,hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. He denies recent fevers, chills or
rigors. He denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the
other review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema,
palpitations.
.
On admission to the floor the vitals were:Afebrile- 112/60 - HR

CXR [**11-6**]:In comparison with the study of [**11-5**], there is no
displacement of
the leads of the pacer-defibrillator device. Again, there is
globular
enlargement of the cardiac silhouette in a patient with previous
CABG and
clips in the thyroid region. However, no evidence of vascular
congestion,
pleural effusion, or acute focal pneumonia.

Liver ultrasound [**11-9**]: Done to rule out gallstones as a cause
for substernal right-sided intermitten pain that is relieved
with NSAIDs on [**2168-11-9**].


Brief Hospital Course:
# Afib: The patient was admitted in Afib with ventricular pacing
which likely exacerbates his CHF symptoms  On [**10-25**] he undervent
DCCV (converted, then reverted to afib, and spontaneously
reverted back to sinus), and was sent home on dofetilide and now
represents in Afib. His home warfarin dose was 6mg. He was
admitted to [**Hospital1 **] for the same symptoms, in afib and
cardioversion there failed. He was on dobutamine drip while
there. On admission, he was weaned off of dobutamine and rate
controled with metoprolol. He was aggressively diuresed and his
symptoms of shortness of breath improved. He converted from
atrial fibrillation to sinus rythm spontaneously on Sunday
[**11-5**]. Thus, the plan for ablation was first delayed and
then cancelled, given that this intervention unlikely to benefit
the patient at this time. We continued him on warfarin and
checked his INR daily with dose adjustments. We also continued
him on Dofetilide (we was briefly switched to quinidine, but
then placed back since he converted). A discussion of home
milronone was entertained, this was discussed with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 437**] who
recommended against milrinone or metolazone at home (would dry
him out too much), but if he comes back with another
decompensated event, would consider home IV therapy. He was
given close follow up with his outpatient cardiologist.
.
# CAD: s/p CABG [**76**] yrs ago. no s/s of ACS during admission. We
continued his home  plavix, simvastatin, and metoprolol was
increased to 100 daily. His imdur ws discontinued due to fear of
hypotension. He was also given potassium supplementation with
his Lasix dose of 120mg twice daily.
.
# Systoloc Heart Failure: Pt is followed by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 437**] from heart
failure clinic. His last echo showed LVEF of 15-20%. He has a
restrictive filling pattern. We continued his home medications.
We managed his CHF with diureses and fluid restriction, as well
as medically as above (see Afib).
.
# CKI: Baseline creatinine 3, stage III, Patient's creatinine
initially increased to 3.6 and trended down with diuresis. We
renally dosed his medications. He was also given potassium
supplementation with his Lasix dose of 120mg twice daily.
.
# DM: Patient was given his home insulin and was covered with
insulin sliding scale as well. His glucose was monitored with
fingersticks. He was sent home with his usual 70-30 insulin with
fingerstick sclae.
.
# COPD: We continued home Advair and he maintained his  pO2
above 90 during his stay and was weaned off of oxygen, which he
required on admission.
.
# Gout: continued allopurinol, but we stopped his colchicine.
