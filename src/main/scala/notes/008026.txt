Brief Hospital Course:
48 yo with hx ETOH abuse complicated by cirrhosis and ascites
s/p TIPS in [**5-19**] presenting with melena and hematochezia.
.
# UGIB - No prior history of UGIB.  Known cirrhosis s/p TIPS,
ultrasound on admission showed patent TIPS but with decreased
velocity.  He was transfused two units of PRBC's on admission,
started on both octreotide and PPI drips.  In addition to
cirrhosis, the patient also had active alcohol use and high dose
NSAID use.  He was seen by the liver service and underwent an
urgent upper endoscopy that showed duodenal ulcers with no
active bleeding, grade I esophageal varices with no stigmata of
recent bleeding, and one ulcer with clot indicating likely
source of recent GIB. Pt received 3 units PRBC in MICU total,
hct stable and increased appropriately with transfusion
post-EGD. Melena thought to be [**1-13**] resolving UGIB from ulcers
rather than new lower GIB. He was transitioned to po PPI with a
stable hct, continued on Ceftriaxone which was transitioned to
Cipro, and discharged with outpatient followup.
.
# Cirrhosis - Cirrhosis felt to be secondary to ETOH abuse.
Currently with acute elevation of liver enzymes, with AST/ALT
ratio > 2 and elevated bilirubin. Acute decompensation maybe
related to TIPS stenosis, ETOH hepatitis, infection. Also with
mild synthetic dysfunction. RUQ US for TIPS patency showed
slowed velocity, and patient will need IR TIPS venogram once
stable as an outpatient. US showed insufficient ascites for
paracentesis, unlikely to be SBP.
.
# Alcohol abuse - Tremulous, last drink the afternoon prior to
admission.  He was initially managed on a Q1h CIWA scale, but
was quickly able to be tapered to a Q4h CIWA scale, he was
initially given a banana bag, then maintained on folic acid, MVI
and thiamine daily.  He was stable at the time of discharge
without need for Valium.
.
# Acute renal failure - Likely pre-renal in setting of GIB and
poor PO intake, FeUrea was 4.8%, consistent with a prerenal
etiology and his creatinine improved with blood transfusions and
IV fluids.
