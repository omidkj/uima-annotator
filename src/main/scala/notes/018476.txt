Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 290**]
Chief Complaint:
Fevers, rigors, rigidity

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
VP shunt tap
Endotrachial intubation and mechanical ventilation

History of Present Illness:
23 year old F with rollover MVC in [**12/2144**] and resulting TBI s/p
craniectomy who was recently admitted to neurosurgery service in
[**2-/2145**] for a cranioplasty. Presenting from rehab with fevers,
rigors, and report of myoclonic jerks. Also a report of
vomiting. According to rehab records, had dose of Keppra
increased approximately 1 week ago. Family notes that patient
has not been herself in last several days and was having more
frequent shaking episodes. They felt like she was becoming ill
and had her sent to ED.
.
In the ED, initial vs were: T 97.8, HR 92, BP 113/73, RR 16,
O2Sat 100%. Shortly after arrival to triage, patient
decompensated with increased temp and HR. Patient was felt to be
having seizure and was given several pushes of lorazepam IV.
Rectal temp shortly into ED course was 103 rectally and climbed
to 105 during ED course. Concordant with spike in temp, HR
climbed as high as 162, and was reportedly sinus tach. Received
5L NS through ED stay. Patient was cooled with ice and was given
acetaminophen. Also felt to be in respiratory distress shortly
after spiking a fever and was intubated. Fentanyl and midazolam
given for sedation. Initial labs significant for lactate of 4.9
and WBC of 14. U/A showed 54 WBC and many bacteria. CSF was
obtained from VP shunt and showed 1 WBC, 1 RBC, nml protein, nml
glucose. Patient was given Vancomycin, Ceftriaxone, and Pip/Tazo
for empiric treatment of fevers. Neurosurgery was consulted in
ED and will follow patient on consult service. Toxicology
consult was called in and and they reviewed meds for possible
causes of serotonin syndrome or NMS. Prior to transfer to the
MICU vitals were: T 101, HR 85, BP 107/58, RR 18, O2Sat 97%
intubated.

.
[**2145-5-4**] CXR:
IMPRESSION: Mild bibasilar atelectasis in the setting of reduced
lung
volumes.
.
[**2145-5-4**] Head CT:
1. Stable extra-axial collection overlying the right cerebral
convexity since [**2145-4-9**].
2. The left frontal subdural collection with small curvi-linear
hyperdense
component appears similar in attenuation but overall is slightly
larger than [**2145-4-9**].
3. No area of abnormal enhancement. If clinical concern remains
high for
infection, MRI is a more sensitive exam.
.
[**2145-5-5**] EEG:
IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal continuous EEG, due to
consistently lower amplitude activity seen over the right
hemisphere, with less high frequency activity and occasional
periods of delta slowing, consistent
with a large underlying structural lesion involving the cortex
on the right. In addition, the presence of mixed diffuse alpha
and beta frequency activity, seen best over the left hemisphere
throughout most of the tracing is consistent with pharmacologic
sedation. The pushbutton event occurring on [**5-5**] at 8:13 pm
appears to be clinically and electrographically consistent with
shivering. There were no epileptiform features seen.
.
[**2145-5-10**] MRI:
IMPRESSION:
1. Post-traumatic severe encephalomalacia of the right temporal
lobe, with ex vacuo dilatation of the temporal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the right
lateral ventricle.
2. Mild to moderate right frontoparietal encephalomalacia.
3. Right epidural and bilateral subdural hematomas, minimally
changed since [**2145-5-4**].
4. No acute superimposed process.
.
[**2145-5-16**] MR Pituitary:
IMPRESSION: Motion artifact somewhat limits the examination.
There is no
definite pituitary mass. Lobular contour of the pituitary
contents likely is secondary to this motion artifact as well as
prominent adjacent pachymeningeal enhancement. There is no mass
effect upon the optic chiasm, and the pituitary stalk is
midline.
