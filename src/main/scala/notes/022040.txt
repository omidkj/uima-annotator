DISCHARGE LABS:

IMAGING:
CT Head [**8-25**]:
1. Extensive fractures through the left temporal, sphenoid, and
parietal
bones as described above.

2. Left-sided epidural hematoma, right-sided subdural hematoma,
and diffuse subarachnoid hemorrhage as described above.

As fracture may extend to the left carotid canal, further
evaluation with CTA of the head is recommended to exclude
vascular injury.

CTA Head [**8-25**]:
IMPRESSION: Stable appearance of left-sided epidural hematoma,
right-sided
subdural hematoma, diffuse subarachnoid hemorrhage and multiple
fractures,
previously described on a dedicated CT of the head. There is no
evidence of major vascular occlusion or vascular dissection.

Ct Head [**8-25**]:
Stable appearance of left-sided epidural hematoma, right-sided
subdural hematoma, and diffuse subarachnoid hemorrhage. Findings
were
discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] at the time of review on [**2187-8-25**].

CT Head [**8-25**]:
Post-surgical changes as delineated above. Pneumocephalus in the
right middle cranial fossa displaces the right temporal lobe
posteriorly. An apparent hypodensity in the inferior right
temporal lobe could indicate a contusion.  No new hemorrhage

CT Head [**8-26**]:
Evolving right temporal infarction/contusion. No new hemorrhage

MRI Head [**8-27**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. Acute infarction/contusion in the right temporal lobe.
2. Supratentorial subarachnoid hemorrhage is again visualized.
Foci of
hemorrhage in the posterior inferior left cerebellar hemisphere
could be
subarachnoid or parenchymal.
3. A punctate hemorrhage in the genu of the right corpus
callosum is
suggestive of diffuse axonal injury

CT Head [**8-27**]:
Stable right temporal lobe hypodensity, bilateral subarachnoid
hemorrhages, ventricular and basilar cistern effacement.
Decreased soft tissue swelling, pneumocephalus, subcutaneous
emphysema. Ethmoid air cell and sphenoid sinus opacification.

CT Head [**8-28**]: No significant change
Stable

CTA Chest, Abd, Pelvis [**8-31**]:
Small filling defect in a subsegmental branch supplying the left
lower
lobe consistent with a small subsegmental pulmonary embolus.
2. Bilateral consolidation at the lung bases, likely aspiration;
however,
cannot exclude pneumonia.
3. Interval resolution of opacity at the right upper lobe
suggesting
resolution of prior atelectasis.
4. Soft tissue structure in anterior mediastinum similar in
size; however,
now decreased density suggesting likely aging/evolving hematoma.

5. Slightly prominent single mediastinal lymph node

CT Head [**9-6**]:
On the postcontrast images, there is mild enhancement of the
temporal lobe
cortex posterior to the surgical resection cavity, in the right
internal
capsule and right frontal lobe which may relate to post-surgical
changes,
inflammation or less likely infection. COnsider MR [**Name13 (STitle) 430**] without
and with
contrast, if not contra-indicated for better assessment if there
is continued concern for intracranial process. No prior
postcontrast iamges are available since the surgery for
comparison.

Brief Hospital Course:
   The patient was admitted overnight on [**8-25**] after fall down a
flight of stairs. He was initially found unresponsive and taken
to [**Hospital **] hospital. Intubation was attempted in the field but
was unsuccessful. He was intubated at [**Hospital1 **] and then
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further care. On arrival to [**Hospital1 18**] it
was noted that he had a EDH over the left temporal lobe, SDH
over the right frontal and temporal lobes, diffuse SAH, as well
as extensive fractures through the left temporal, sphenoid, and
parietal bones.  He was admitted to the ICU for monitoring.
   On the morning of [**8-25**] during rounds his exam was poor and
continued with a GCS of 3 off sedation. As a result of his exam,
an ICP bolt was placed at the bedside by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]. After
placement of the bolt and waiting 5 minutes for the [**Location (un) 1131**] to
settle it was noted that his ICP was sustaining in the low 50's.
Measures were undertaken in order to medically treat his
increased ICP including hyperventilation to a PCO2 below 30, 23%
saline, and mannitol. Initially these measures lowered his ICP
to the low 20's however his pressures soon elevated again and it
was decided that he would be taken to the operating room
emergently for a bilateral hemicraniectomy and partial right
temporal lobe resection.
   In the OR it was noted that his brain was under high pressure
and the bone flaps were left off after surgery in order to allow
for swelling.  He tolerated the surgery without complications
and his vital signs remained stable throughout the procedure.
Post-operatively he was taken back to the ICU for monitoring and
placed in a pentobarbital coma. A Vigeleo was placed for
monitoring of cardiac status during the pentobarbital coma
however EEG was not placed.  On [**8-26**] his exam remained poor
while being monitored in the ICU. He had a weak cough and
sluggish corneals on exam and did not respond to painful
stimuli. He still was induced in a pentobarbital coma at this
time. Upon exam his craniectomy sites were very tense.
   An MRI of the head was done on the 25th which showed acute
infarction/contusion of the R temporal lobe, supratentorial
hemorrhage and foci of hemorrhage in the inferior left
cerebellar hemisphere, and a punctate hemorrhage in the genu of
the right corpus callosum suggestive of [**Doctor First Name **].

ON [**8-27**], the decision was made to d/c the pentobarb and to
obtain a proper exam.  His status was monitored by daily Head
CTs, which improved silghtly each day and did not demonstrate
any acute hemorrhage or infarct.  He developed transient fevers
beginning on [**8-28**].  His blood, urine, and sputum cultures were
all negative, and serially followed.
    His neurological exam improved slightly beginning on [**8-30**],
as his pupils were reactive and he began to withdraw his
extremities.  Beca
