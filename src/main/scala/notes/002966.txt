.
[**2126-10-21**] CTA head/neck:
1. Large left neck hematoma with active extravasation of IV
contrast within the hematoma.  Part of this extravasation
appears to be arising from the left subclavian vein.  The more
superior active extravasation is located adjacent to a deep
cervical artery branch of the right thyrocervical trunk.
2. There is compression and anterior displacement of the left
internal jugular vein by the large neck hematoma.
3. Comminuted sternal fracture with stranding of the anterior
mediastinal fat suggestive of mediastinal hemorrhage and likely
hemorrhage along the left lung apex. Recommend further
evaluation with a dedicated CTA of the chest.
4. Multiple nodular densities at the right lung apex, which may
represent prior granulomatous disease, but this can be better
evaluated by the dedicated chest CT.
.
[**2126-10-21**] CXR:
Limited study with probable right middle and right lower lobe
collapse.  Left lower lobe collapse is also likely.  Increased
pleural thickening along the right lung may reflect blood in the
pleural space with multiple right-sided rib fractures noted.
.
[**2126-10-21**] L subclavian arteriogram:
No arterial bleeding or pseudoaneurysm was noted on left
subclavian arteriogram.
.
[**2126-10-25**] sputum: Haemophilus influenzae (Beta lactamase
negative)
.
[**2126-10-28**] sputum: MRSA, Haemophilus influenzae (Beta lactamase
negative)
.
[**2126-10-28**] CXR:
Endotracheal tube has been placed terminating 3 cm above the
carina with the neck in a flexed position.  New diffuse but
asymmetrically distributed airspace opacities have developed
affecting the right lung to a much greater degree than the left.
 It is uncertain whether this represents asymmetric edema or
massive aspiration.  Left lower lobe shows improved aeration,
but there is persistent collapse of the right lower lobe.
Moderate layering right pleural effusion is present as well as
multiple right-sided rib fractures. Likely small left pleural
effusion is also demonstrated.
.
[**2126-10-31**] CT chest:
1.  No strong evidence of empyema, but there are small bilateral
pleural
effusions layer dependently, a portion of the right pleural
effusion is
loculated posteriorly.
2.  Diffuse ground-glass opacity in both lungs, most likely
edema,
alternatively hemorrhage or pneumonia.
3.  Multiple tharacic fractures, including the manubrium and
right second through ninth ribs, multiple in the fifth and sixth
ribs.
4.  Coronary artery calcifications and atherosclerotic
calcification of the aorta.
.
[**2126-11-5**] Renal US:
No evidence of hydronephrosis, calculi, or renal masses.
.
[**2126-11-6**] CXR:
In comparison with study of [**11-5**], there appears to be
increasing
opacification involving much of the left hemithorax, consistent
with the
clinical impression of widespread pneumonia.  Lower lung volumes
appear to
accentuate the areas of atelectasis on the right.  Tracheostomy
tube and right central catheter remain in place.
.
[**2126-11-7**] echo:
The left atrium is elongated. Left ventricular wall thickness,
cavity size and regional/global systolic function are normal
(LVEF >55%) There is no ventricular septal defect. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good
leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
structurally normal. No mitral regurgitation is seen. The
pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
There is no pericardial effusion. There is an anterior space
which most likely represents a fat pad.
.
[**2126-11-12**] RUE US:
No ultrasonographic evidence of DVT involving the right upper
extremity.
.
[**2126-11-14**] CXR:
Previously cleared right lung has returned to severe
consolidation,
accompanied by worsening of left lung consolidation which was
predominantly suprahilar.  Most likely this is due to a somewhat
asymmetric pulmonary edema, given the simultaneous increase in
heart size and volume of small pleural effusions.  Tracheostomy
tube in standard placement.  No pneumothorax.
.
[**2126-11-14**] sputum: Enterobacter cloacae (pan sensitive)
[**2126-11-14**] BAL: Enterobacter cloacae
.
[**2126-11-15**] IR placement of tunneled catheter:
Successful placement of a 15.5 French 23 cm cuff-to-tip length
double-lumen hemodialysis catheter via the right internal
jugular vein.  The tip of the catheter is located in the right
atrium.  The catheter is ready for use.
.
[**2126-11-20**] CXR:
1.  Status post insertion of double lumen central venous
catheter with no
evidence of complications.
2.  Overall improvement of pleural effusion and parenchymal
consolidation.

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient underwent CTA of the head/neck for his L neck hematoma;
it demonstrated extravasation from the L subclavian vein and a
deep cervical arterial branch of the R thyrocervical trunk.
Patient underwent L subclavian arteriogram for possible
embolization; no bleeding was noted.
.
His other injuries included a small splenic hematoma, flail
chest (R 2nd-9th rib fractures), and a comminuted sternal
fracture.  He was admitted to the floor for observation, with
serial hematocrits and serial exams, both of which were stable.
.
He had intermittent episodes of decreased O2 saturation.  He
underwent bronchoscopy on [**10-25**] for persistent RLL collapse; he
was found to have a mild to moderate quantity of thick mucoid
sputum on the R side, which was aspirated.  Levofloxacin was
started for CAP.  Pulmonology recomme
