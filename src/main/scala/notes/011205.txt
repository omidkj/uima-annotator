HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 67 year old
female transferred from [**Hospital3 3583**] for failure to wean
and consideration of tracheostomy.  The patient was admitted
to the hospital on [**2159-6-14**], with a one to two week history
of productive cough and increasing shortness of breath.
Chest x-ray at that time revealed a right upper lobe
infiltrate, white blood cell count of 20.0 with a left shift
and CPK of 2484 with negative troponin.  The patient was
started on Rocephin and Azithromycin for pneumonia.  She was
also noted to have a heart rate in the 160s and to be in
atrial fibrillation which was rate controlled with Lopressor.
On hospital day number four, the patient developed
hypercarbic respiratory distress, intubated.  In addition,
the patient began to display signs of alcohol withdrawal.
She was extubated on [**2159-6-25**], but on [**2159-6-30**], began to
develop respiratory distress.  Arterial blood gas done at
that time was 7.24/68.4/59 and chest x-ray showed complete
opacification of the left lung consistent with a mucous plug.
Bronchoscopy on [**2159-7-2**], showed diffuse airway erythema and
dynamic right collapse with thick secretions.  Her
antibiotics were changed.  She was started on Zosyn and
Levaquin after being on Imipenem and Levaquin for an unknown
duration.  She was again extubated on [**2159-7-7**].  Her gas at
that time was 7.41/56/199.  After six hours, she again
developed increasing dyspnea, and arterial blood gas showed a
pH of 7.21, pCO2 91.3 and pO2 of 71.3.  The patient was
reintubated for hypercarbic respiratory failure.  The patient
continued in sinus rhythm on Rythmol and Lopressor.  She was
transferred to [**Hospital1 69**] for
further care.  Her hospital course at [**Hospital3 3583**] was
also significant for percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy
placement on [**2159-7-4**], and an echocardiogram on [**2159-6-14**],
which showed no wall abnormalities and an ejection fraction
of 60%.

blood pressure 134/60, oxygen saturation 98%.  She weighed
116 kilograms.  She was on SIMV with tidal volume of 700,
respiratory rate 10, PEEP 5, FIO2 50%, PIP 27, plateau of 13.
She was overbreathing the ventilator at a rate of 19,
spontaneous volumes around 240cc.  In general, she was alert
and following commands.  Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat -
The pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light and

Of note, her hospital course at [**Hospital3 3583**] had also been
significant for a gastrointestinal bleed.  Her initial
hematocrit was 40.7 which slowly trended down to a low of
24.0 on [**2159-6-26**].  She was given two units of packed red
blood cells with another two units on [**2159-6-28**], and another

effusion.  No significant emphysematous changes.  Her
microbiology laboratories showed multiple cultures including
urine cultures with no growth.  Stool cultures negative for
Clostridium difficile toxin and no growth.  Blood cultures
with no growth.   Urine positive for [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 564**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].
Sputum on [**2159-7-2**], with many white blood cells and a few

31.6, platelet count 205,000.  Chem7 showed sodium 155,
potassium 3.7, chloride 113, bicarbonate 38, blood urea
nitrogen 51, creatinine 1.1, glucose 104 with anion gap of
4.0.  Free calcium 1.17, lactate of 1.3.  Coagulation studies

time 27.6.  ALT 22, AST 29, alkaline phosphatase 187, total
bilirubin 0.8, albumin 2.6, calcium 8.8, phosphorus 2.9,
magnesium 2.1.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The [**Hospital 228**] hospital course was
significant for the following issues:
1.  Respiratory failure with hypercarbic respiratory arrest -
The differential diagnosis included lobar pneumonia with
mucous plugging, pleural effusion, pulmonary embolus was
thought to be unlikely given her good oxygenation.  Chest
x-ray was negative for congestive heart failure.  She was
placed on assist control ventilation and continued treatment
with Zosyn and Levaquin for community acquired pneumonia.
Sputum cultures were obtained.  The patient continued to be
afebrile.  The patient had a mild low grade fever on
[**2159-7-12**], for which sputum cultures were obtained which
showed no growth.  Antibiotics were stopped on [**2159-7-12**],
since there was no set plan from [**Hospital3 3583**] for a ten to
fourteen day course.  The patient continued to require
mechanical ventilation and esophageal balloon was placed to
determine the contribution of body habitus to the respiratory
distress.  The patient's pleural pressure was determined to
be approximately 20 to 22.  The patient had several trials of
pressure support and was maintained with a high PEEP of 20.
