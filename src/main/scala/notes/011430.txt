Chest: bibasilar crackles, labored breathing
Abdomen: soft, nontender, + tympany to percussion, no HSM, NABS
Extremities: no c/c/e
Rectal: no masses, guaiac negative


Pertinent Results:
[**1-26**] CXR
Moderately severe pulmonary edema, not appreciably changed since
earlier in the day, the lung volumes have improved. Bibasilar
consolidation, presumably represents coalescent edema and
atelectasis. Small bilateral pleural effusions are present.
Heart size normal. ET tube and nasogastric tube, and right PIC
catheter in standard placements respectively. No pneumothorax.

[**1-29**] CXR
Previous severe pulmonary edema has improved substantially.
Consolidation is largely restricted to the lower lungs which may
be a combination of edema and atelectasis, not necessarily
pneumonia.

Heart size is normal. Pleural effusions if any are small and
there is no pneumothorax. Tip of the endotracheal tube is
partially obscured but appears to be more than a centimeter
above the upper margin of the clavicles and 7 cm from the
carina, and should be advanced 3-4 cm. Nasogastric tube ends in
the lower stomach and an esophageal manometer in the upper.
Right jugular line ends in the upper right atrium.

Successful placement of post-pyloric feeding tube with tip in
the distal duodenum

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to Transplant Surgery as a transfer
from an outside hospital for management of her bilateral
pneumonias.  Upon arrival to the ED, she was transfered
immediately to the ICU.
# Neuro - The patient was sedated with propofol and versed
throughout initial period of intubation.  Pain was adequately
controlled during hospitalization.
# Pulmonary - Upon arrival to the SICU, she was intubated and
bronchoscopied.  Pulmonary was consulted. On HD 6 ([**1-31**]) the
patient was successfully extubated without complications.
# Cardiovascular - Upon arrival to the SICU, she was started on
pressors for hemodynamic instability and transfused 1u PRBC.  By
HD2, she was weaned off of pressors but eventually required
another 2 units of PRBC.
# Renal - The patient required aggressive diuresis with
furosemide after she was hemodynamically stable. Creatinine 2.6
on admission and 2.5 on discharge with mild variations during
hospitalization. Followed by Renal, no biopsy at this time
# Infectious diseases - Upon arrival, she was started on IV
vanco/zosyn/cipro.  Infectious diseases service was consulted.
BAL revealed no organisms on gram stain or culture.  PCP stains
were all negative but the patient was switched from inhaled
pentamidine to bactrim for prophylaxis.  Vanco was d/c'd on HD5
CMV Viral load was found to be positive with initial result of
922 copies. She was started on IV gancyclovir. She [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) 7387**]
on IV prophylaxis as an outpatient for 2 weeks post discharge
due to concerns that PO dosing will not be appropriately
absorbed.

# Endocrine - the patient's glucose was initially labile and
required an insulin drip. Followed by [**Last Name (un) **] while hospitalized,
she will resume Lantus and Humalog upon discharge.

# FEN/GI - Nasointestinal tube was placed via fluoroscopy on
[**1-30**] to start tube feeds which were d/c'd by [**2-1**].

# Immunosuppression - She was maintained on her cyclosporin but
required several modifications to her dosages.  She also was
placed on IV Solumedrol until she was able to take adequate po
and was switched to Prednisone 40mg. This was subsequently
tapered and she will be discharged home on 5 mg daily.

Upon discharge, the patient was afebrile with all vitals stable,
tolerating po feeds, ambulating but requiring assistive devices
which were provided for home use through [**Hospital1 5065**], and with pain
controlled on po pain medication.
