HeadCT: Left temporal intraparanchmal and [**Hospital1 **]-intraventricular
bleeds
Facial CT:No definite fx or swelling
ABDCT/Pelvis: neg
C-spineCT: neg
Chest: unremarkable for any acute cardiopulmonary process; old
arch dissection stable

Brief Hospital Course:

74 yo M with PMHX of HTN, CAD, DM/CRI, Afib on Coumadin with L
parietal IPH s/p fall

1.Intracranial bleed:
On day of admission INR 5.8, and Coumadin was stopped.  Patient
received Vit k and FFP and 75% (2 vials) of predicted dose of
Proplex(Factor [**8-6**] combo) to correct coagulopathy.

Admission CT showed L parietal IPH and SAH, small
intraventricular bleed. The patient was started on Dilantin for
prophylaxis of post-traumatic head bleed and his dilantin was
subsequently stopped on day 8 after his admission. Shortly after
admission patient developed worsening mental status and the
patient was followed by neurosurgery. Repeat CT ([**3-23**]) showed
interval change in head bleed and follow-up CT on [**3-24**] showed
stable head bleed. Patient's aspirin continues to be held and
restarting should be considered following follow up appointment
with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 14074**].

2. Mental Status Change:
Throughout the patient's admission, he continued to wax and wane
and sundown.  Etiology of mental status changes most likely
multifactorial etiology which include head bleed, possibilty of
medications and hospital-delirium (per family patient has
history of delirium when hospitalized per family).  Throughout
his hospital course, avoided anticholingerics including
benadryl, and anti-psycotics as on sotalol & may lead to QT
prolongation. On the day of discharge, patient showed markedly
improved neurological examination and alert and talkative.  He
was following simple commands but not 3-step commands.

3. Afib:
Patient had some bursts of tachycardia on telemtry and was
evaluated by EP and recommended to titrate Lopressor and
continue Sotalol on home dose. Due to head bleed, no further
Coumadin. Pt not on Amio due to adverse rxn (delta MS).  Off of
coumadin due to head bleed

4.DM:
Covered with RISS and can have oral agents after mental status
cleared and taking good POs

5. Blood pressure:
Blood pressure initially high due to head bleed SBP >160 and
during hospital course was titrated with Lopressor and
Hydralzine to obtain normotensive blood pressure upon discharge

6. C-spine clearance:
Initial C spine CT showed no evidence of fracture however,
C-spine films were sub-optimal as unable to visualize all 7
Cervical vertebra.  Due to mental status changes, c-spine
clearance via flex/ext films (to r/o ligamentous injury) was
pending improvement of mental status changes.  Upon discharge to
rehab, patient's C-spine should be cleared with flex/extension
films when patient able to follow commands

7.
CHF
- EF > 55%. He was on regimen of metoprolol and [**Last Name (un) **]. Lasix was
held due to increase in BUN & Cr.

8.
CRI (baseline Cr 1.5-1.7)

Lasix was held due to increase in BUN & Cr. Upon discharge
patient's Cr at baseline.

Patient's condition at time of discharge is good. He is to be
discharged to rehab
