Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2297**]
Chief Complaint:
j-tube replacement
.
Reason for MICU transfer: Aspiration vs. Mucus plug w/ frequent
suctioning need


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
In brief, this is an 85M who presented to the ED on [**8-30**] from
nursing home for j-tube replacement (originally placed for
repeated aspirations) but admission labs showed Na 115, non-gap
acidosis, and ARF on CRF, and so was admitted to medicine for
abnormal labs.

His admission CXR also showed questionable LLL PNA, and so given
Vanc/Cefepime for presumed HCAP.  Patient has significant
history of aspiration in the past and on while on floor on [**9-5**],
patient had episode of aspiration vs. mucus plugging with desats
to 70s on RA.  Deep suctioning corrected to 98% on NRB.  Patient
was transferred to MICU for continued need for frequent
suctioning.

During admission, patient had acute on chronic MS changes which
was thought to be [**1-30**] delerium vs. rapid correction on Na (now
145).  Pt also has recent history of myoclonus.  MRI was
negative in this patient with hx of CVA.  Neurology is
following.

The cause of his hyponatremia and non-gap acidosis was presumed
to be from frequent free water flushes through his j-tube as
outpatient.  Na has since corrected with sodium bicarb but
patient still has a metabolic nongap acidosis.

Brief Hospital Course:
Primary Reason for Hospitalization: 85yo M with complex medical
hx who initially presented with hyponatremia, non-AG metabolic
acidosis and PNA. Transferred to MICU for aspiration pneumonitis
and mucus plugging requiring frequent suctioning and passed away
from hypoxic respiratory failure.

# Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Throughout his course in the MICU
the patient had frequent hypoxic events. He was chronically
aspirating and mucous plugging with inability to clear
secretions. He would frequently desaturate to the 60s despite
supplemental oxygen which would improve with deep suctioning.
However eventually the deep suctioning became less effective and
the patient had longer and longer episodes of hypoxia.  Plan of
care reviewed in detail with patient??????s family (including HCP) at
bedside. After discussion and review of the current situation,
they felt that the patient would not want a prolonged course of
suffering. They said he would want to focus all further efforts
on comfort. Given his inability to tolerate suctioning without
grimacing and struggling to breath, it was decided to defer any
further aggressive attempts to endo- or [**Last Name (un) **]-tracheally suction
him. He was transitioned to comfort measures only and passed
away shortly thereafter with family at the bedside.
.
#. Change in mental status: Change in mental status occurred
during admission with multiple intermittent hypoxic events as
well that were likely contributing to a hypoactive delirium.
.
# Hypernatremia:  Initially hyponatremic on admission. Free
water flushes in tube feeds were titrated.
.
# HCAP:  Completed course of Vanc and Cefepime (finished course
[**9-7**])
.
# Tachycardia/ECG changes:  ECG showed TWIs in lateral leads,
lower voltage, positive troponin (however had renal failure).
TTE: Mild global biventricular systolic dysfunction (EF 40%).
Mild mitral regurgitation. Moderate tricuspid regurgitation.
Moderate pulmonary hypertension
.
#. Non AG metabolic acidosis:  Felt to be due to GI losses from
colostomy bag and acute renal failure vs IVF hydration with NS.

.
# Acute on Chronic Renal Failure:  Initially elevated to 3.5 on
admission, but returned to baseline with fluids.
.
# Anemia:  Work up showed [**Doctor Last Name **] studies consistent with anemia
of chronic disease (Fe 23, TIBC 160, Ferritin 756, Transferrin
123). There were no active signs of bleeding.
