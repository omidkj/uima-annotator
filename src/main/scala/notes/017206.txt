MRI BRAIN:
1) Acute infarction in the left middle cerebral artery
distribution.
2) Acute to subacute infarction in the left middle cerebellar
peduncle.
3) Chronic lacunar infarcts in the left basal ganglia and right
thalamus.
4) Relative poor flow in the left middle cerebral artery
compared to the right with near absence of detectable flow in
the left middle cerebral artery Sylvian branches, a new finding
compared to the CT angiogram of one day prior.
.
Carotid series: IMPRESSION: Mild plaque in the proximal internal
carotid arteries bilaterally, with estimated percentage of
stenosis less than 40%.

Brief Hospital Course:
63 yo with HTN, DM, hypercholesterolemia, ESRD on HD who
presented with sudden onset right hemiparesis and global
aphasia. MRI shows superior division left MCA infarction, likely
cardioembolic due to atrial fibrillaion. Remained intubated
through [**2156-10-22**] due to persistent apnea.  Family meetings were
held to discuss the Pt's lack of improvement over time and
overall poor prognosis with her family. Based on what would be
consistent with the Pt's wishes, the decision was made to
extubate and discontinue dialysis.  A transition was made to
comfort measures only. Pt died [**2156-10-22**], time of death
pronouncement was 6:30pm.
