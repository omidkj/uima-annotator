Brief Hospital Course:
Pt transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] intubated, treatment continued for
presumed pna, pt became more difficult to ventilate.
Bronchoscopy showed further migration of L mainstem bronchus
stent. Stent now obstructing both right and left mainstem
bronchi at level of carina.  IP felt that surgical removal would
cause excessive morbidity/mortality. After discussion with
family, pt made CMO.  Pt was extubated and then expired.
