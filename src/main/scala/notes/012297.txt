   Blood Culture, Routine (Final [**2195-1-6**]):
      ENTEROCOCCUS FAECALIS.    FINAL SENSITIVITIES.
         HIGH LEVEL GENTAMICIN SCREEN: Resistant to 500 mcg/ml
of
         gentamicin. Screen predicts NO synergy with penicillins
or
         vancomycin. Consult ID for treatment options.
         HIGH LEVEL STREPTOMYCIN SCREEN: Susceptible to
1000mcg/ml of

selected

Echo [**1-6**]
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left and
right ventricular systolic function appears depressed. There are
simple atheroma in the ascending aorta. There are simple
atheroma in the aortic arch. There are simple atheroma in the
descending thoracic aorta. The aortic valve leaflets are
moderately thickened with fusion of the right and left coronary
cusps. No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve.
The study is inadequate to exclude significant aortic valve
stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. No mass or vegetation is seen on
the mitral valve. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. There is
no pericardial effusion.

Impression: Thickened aortic valve with fusion of left and right
cusps. No evidence of vegetation or mass to suggest
endocarditis. The pacing wire is without evidence of
vegetations. Biventricular systolic dysfunction.

IMPRESSION:
1. No son[**Name (NI) 493**] evidence for acute cholecystitis.

2. Likely gallbladder polyp; recommend son[**Name (NI) 493**] followup in

[**1-7**] US of pacemaker site
IMPRESSION: No fluid collection or hyperemia involving the
pacemaker pocket.

Brief Hospital Course:
76 yo Male with sCHF (EF 20-25%), CAD s/p CABG, HTN, NIDDM,
A-fib on anticoagulation, s/p PPM, s/p recent CCU stay for VF
arrest requiring pressor support, admitted from cardiac rehab
with fevers and bacteremia.

1. Bacteremia/Hypotension: The patient was admitted with 2/2
Blood cultures from Cardiac rehab growing enterococcus on [**1-1**].
In the ED he had hypotension responsive to IVF.  After admission
to the ICU his SBPs dropped briefly, but were responsive to more
IVF fluids.  He was initally treated with ceftriaxone and
vancomycin empirically. [**3-21**] sets of BCx sent from the ED on [**1-2**]
grew GPCs within less then 24 hours and speciated to
enterococcus sensitive to vancomycin and ampicillin.
Antibiotics were narrowed to ampicillin 2 gm IV q4h when
sensitivities returned.  A TTE was ordered to evaluate for
endocarditis and showed no evidence of vegatations. Patient had
no stigmata of endocarditis on physical exam.  Surveillance
cultures on [**1-5**], 20th, and 21st were all NGTD on
discharge. The patient had a work up to evaluate for source of
enterococcus bacteremia. Infectious disease was consu
