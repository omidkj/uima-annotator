Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4691**]
Chief Complaint:
Unwitnessed fall

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2125-4-17**]: Exploratory laparotomy

History of Present Illness:
This is a 67 yo M transferred from OSH s/p fall with dislocation
of L hip. The patient was down for an unknown amount of time and
was found to have a CK of [**Numeric Identifier 389**] at the OSH with a K of 7 and
increased Scr. He was also found to have a mottled RUE and RLE.
On arrival to [**Hospital1 18**] the patient was also complaining of
abdominal pain, mainly in his LLQ. He then became progressively
hypotensive and ultimately unresponsive and was intubated by the
ED staff. A the time of examination the patient is sedated but
responds to pain and exhibits guarding on his abdominal exam.
History is obtained from the ED staff and OSH records. His next
of [**Doctor First Name **] is his wife who is currently hospitalized at an OSH for
rhabdo following a fall and is a poor historian.

OSH Pelvix XRAY: Dislocation of the left hip

CT abdomen/pelvis:
1.  Malplaced central venous catheter with its tip likely
interarterial at the aortic arch.  This finding was urgently
discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in person upon discovery at 2:10
a.m.
2.  Extensive ischemic bowel affecting the majority of the
ileum, and probably also of the distal jejunum with associated
portal venous gas.
3.  Heterogeneous appearance of the liver likely reflects
ischemia.
4.  Delayed renal excretion of contrast, consistent with acute
kidney injury.

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient was emergently evaluated by Acute Care Surgery, Hand
Surgery, and Vascular Surgery in the operating room. He was
profoundly dehydrated with a CK of 85,000 on admission
consistent with rhabomyolysis from having collapsed at home and
unable to move for approximately 24 hours. Patient was also
profoundly acidemic with severe renal failure. CT revealed
significant bowel ischemia and patient was taken to the OR
emergently for exploration. Upon laparotomy, the entire small
bowel and colon appeared necrosed and dead. There was no viable
tissue to preserve. The abdomen was closed. The patient's wife
was called and informed of the unfortunate outcome and that this
finding was incompatible with life and irreversible. She elected
to redirect care toward comfort measures. Patient was started on
a fentanyl drip and brought to the ICU. He was extubated at
10:15 am and expired at 10:40 am.
