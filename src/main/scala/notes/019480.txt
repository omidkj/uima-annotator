HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 71 year old
black married male who noted pain with jaundice in [**2192-6-24**].  The patient underwent a computerized tomography scan
that revealed dilated ducts and he then underwent an
endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography in which he
received a stent.  He presented to the [**Hospital6 649**] on [**2192-8-7**], where he underwent the
Whipple procedure.  Preoperative diagnosis was pancreatic
cancer, postoperative cancer was same.  Surgeon of record was
[**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1305**], Assistant [**Location (un) 16059**].  Intraoperative findings
included a large mass at the head of the pancreas but no
signs of distant metastasis.  There was no free fluid in the
abdomen and there were no grossly enlarged lymph nodes.  The
nodules in the liver were around the peritoneal surfaces and
the vessels at the base of the transverse mesocolon were
clean.  There was marked thickening around the common bile
duct and some adhesions to the gallbladder.  The pathology
report includes pancreas, tumors and abscess.  The specimen
for this synopsis is from the Whipple resection.  The
location of the tumor is at the head of the pancreas.  The
size of the tumor is 1 by 2.5 by 3 cm, histologic type,
ductal adenocarcinoma.  Histologic grade, moderately to
poorly differentiated.  Lymph nodes were not positive.
Vascular invasion with absent perineural invasion was
present.  Surgical margins were negative.  However, the
peripancreatic fat involved by tumor, duodenal negative,
gastric negative, common bile duct negative.

On the morning of [**8-8**], the patient was noted to have a
distended abdomen.  The patient's hematocrit had dropped and
although the patient was hemodynamically stable he was on the
hypotensive side and the patient was thought to be actively
bleeding and he was taken back to the Operating Room.  On
[**2192-8-8**] he underwent an exploratory laparotomy,
evacuation of clot and suture ligature of bleeding vessels
and packing.  Preoperative diagnosis was postoperative
bleeding, postoperative diagnosis was postoperative bleeding.
Surgeon of record was [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1305**], Assistant [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 449**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 16059**].
Estimated blood loss during this procedure was approximately
2500 cc.  The patient was then taken back to the Intensive
Care Unit where he remained intubated for several days.  The
patient went into atrial fibrillation on [**8-9**].  The
patient was put on Beta blocker and was found to be in normal
sinus rhythm on [**8-10**].  The patient was kept on Kefzol
and Flagyl during the postoperative period and also required
pressors to maintain normotension.  The patient spiked a
temperature and was cultured on [**8-11**].  Sputum culture
grew out Pseudomonas Aeruginosa for which the patient was put
on Ciprofloxacin and Ceptaz.  On [**8-13**], the patient
underwent another surgical procedure.  The patient underwent
exploratory laparotomy and removal of packing that had been
placed in the patient's abdomen for the purposes of
hemostasis on [**8-8**].  On [**8-13**] these packs were
removed.  Surgeon of record is Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1305**], Assistant is
[**Location (un) 16059**].  The patient did require Hydralazine and Lopressor to
control his blood pressure in the postoperative period.

On [**8-17**], the patient underwent a computerized tomography
scan of the abdomen and pelvis that revealed ascites and
peritoneal inflammatory change expected for the stated
postoperative period.  No abscess or loculated collection was
identified within the abdomen or pelvis.  The patient did
continue to do well in the Intensive Care Unit and was
extubated on [**8-20**].  The patient required several days of
diuresis with Lasix.  This was required to take off much of
the fluid that the patient needed in the immediate
postoperative phase.  The patient had a blood culture from
[**8-26**] that grew out [**Female First Name (un) 564**] Albicans, thus the patient
was started on Fluconazole.  The patient continued to have
problems with fluid overload and episodes of desaturation and
aggressive Lasix therapy was continued.  By [**8-29**], much
of the patient's fluid had been diuresed and he was now
satting 91 to 97% on 2 liters of nasal cannula.  Mr. [**Known lastname **]
continued to do well.

As of [**9-2**], the patient was tolerating p.o. feeds.  He
did not require jejunostomy tube feeds.  He was taking soft
palate diet.  He had passed a swallow study test and was
taking in good p.o. intake and not having any episodes of
coughing.  He has been told to eat all of his food in a
bolt-upright position.  His Foley catheter was discontinued
on [**9-2**], he has voided adequately after discontinuing
the Foley catheter.  He still does have a pancreatic drain in
place of his cap and he also had a jejunostomy tube in place.
Other than that he no longer has any tubes in his body other
than intravenous line.  His pain is adequately controlled
with p.o. pain medications and he is now ready to be
discharged to rehabilitation center.
