Mr. [**Known lastname 392**] is a 60 year old gentleman with a history of alcohol
consumption, who is being admitted with acute onset of
decompensated cirrhosis. Patient developed right leg weakness in
[**2162-11-28**]. This grew progressively worse, until right leg
"buckled out" from under him (attributed to subsequently found
iliopsoas hematoma). When he was picked up by EMS at that time,
they noticed that he was floridly jaundiced. Since then, he has
had two admissions to [**Hospital3 **] Hospital for new onset,
decompendated cirrhosis. His MELD was 28 on [**2-8**]. Now, per
advice of his outpatient Hepatologists, he is being admitted
from [**Hospital 38380**] Rehab ([**Location 30150**]; Phone: ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 110577**]). He
was still on prednisone until [**3-1**] (when it was discontinued in
clinic). His LFT's were in the 900 in mid [**Month (only) 958**], and are coming
down. From outpatient clinic on [**3-1**], labs on [**3-1**] showed that
LFTs trended down from previous, but patient was clinically
worse with MELD 30. Patient then admitted for expedited work-up.
Biopsy has not been done previously.
.
Patient reports that he has never been jaundiced before. He
denies any abdominal distention, episodes of confusion,
hematochezia, melena or hematemesis. He has been drinking [**11-29**]
glasses of white wine per day since [**2152-8-8**]. Prior to that, he
had alternating periods of alcohol consumption and sobriety. He
denies any past IV drug use, tattoos, blood transfusions, or
surgeries. He has never been told that he has high blood
pressure in the past. He has not been sexually active for the
past 25 years, but never checked for any sexually transmitted
diseases. He is unaware of any iron disorders. He denies any
family history of any liver diseases or cancers. He is of
English decent.
.
Today, he just notes that he has pain on his coccyx from a
couple of ulcers that were being treated with special dressings
at rehab.
