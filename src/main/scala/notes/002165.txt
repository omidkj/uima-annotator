Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1167**]
Chief Complaint:
"edema"

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Right heart catherization
CVVHD (hemodialysis)

History of Present Illness:
75 year old female with CAD, CHF EF 60%, DMII, COPD presenting
from Dr.[**Name (NI) 3536**] office with decompensated heart failure and
episodes of chest pain.  Patient was recently admitted from
[**Date range (1) 62457**] and during admission had chest pain radiating to her
jaw w/ associated shortness of breath.  She underwent pMIBI
which showed reversivle lateral wall defects.  Given concurrent
GI work-up it was felt that further cardiac work-up could be
done as outpatient and consideration of cardiac catheterization.
 Patient is somewhat difficult to get a history from, but does
state she has had a couple of episodes of chest pain since her
last discharge, is unable to tell me how long the episodes
lasted or associated symptoms.  She does feel like she continues
to gain weight and feels that she has gained "80 lbs of fluid
since last [**Month (only) 205**]." She has baseline leg swelling but this feels
worse than usual and is uncomfortable.
.
Patient is also complaining of bilateral knee pain since fall 3
days prior to admission.  She was walking from her walker to bed
and may have tripped.  She thinks she fell on her knees and may
have hit her head (although she is not sure).  She has been
ambulating since and does have quite a bit of pain at baseline
for which she takes ultram.  Her baseline pain seems to be in
bilateral knees and lower back at sight of prior back surgery.
.
ROS: No fevers, chills, (+) nausea (?baseline), no vomiting,
baseline abdominal pain, knee pain.  Orthopnea at baseline (2
pillow), no PND.  Chest pain episodes as above.  Breathing feels
somewhat worse than normal, no coughing.

Brief Hospital Course:
# Acute renal failure - baseline 1.0 (2.0 at nursing home on
[**3-24**], now rising 2.9->4.8). ACE inhibitor and metformin held
given acute renal failure. FeUrea 17 (c/w pre-renal).  Renal
team was consulted.  Patient initiated on CVVH due to concern
for uremia, given tremors and BUN of 99.  However, urine output
was preserved and patient received a trial off of CVVH.  Renal
function continued to improve and patient began to autodiurese.
She is now at baseline renal function.  She should have her
renal function checked on Monday and the results faxed to Dr. [**Name (NI) 10875**] office at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 9825**] (fax), phone [**Telephone/Fax (1) 3512**].  If
her creatinine is increased by 30% from baseline of .[**7-24**], then
the lisinopril and metformin should be stopped and restarted
after renal function improves at a lower dose.
.
#. Congestive heart failure - Patient admitted initially with
chest pain and shortness of breath.  Could not undergo
left-heart catheterizaion due to renal insufficiency.  However,
right-heart catheterization demonstrated elevated filling
pressures as above, likely due to diastolic dysfunction. Patient
was not actively diuresed, and oxygen saturation, daily weights,
and fluid balance were monitored. CVP approx 10 when line was
pulled.  Therefore was not recommended for further diurese
especially given recent renal failure.
.
#. Coronary artery disease - Patient ruled out for active
ischemia and did not have any new ECG changes.  She was
maintained on her aspirin and beta-blocker.  ACE inhibitor was
held due to acute renal failure.  During a previous admission,
stress MIBI showed reversible lateral wall defect.
Catheterization deferred on that admission as she was undergoing
work-up for CBD papillary mass (path neg for malignancy).  On
this admission, cardiac catheterization was deferred until renal
function improved and will be readdressed as an outpatient.
.
# DMII - Held oral hypoglycemics (metformin, glipizide) while
inpatient initially when in renal failure.  Once patient was
with noramal renal function, she was transitioned back to home
meds with better glucose control. Continue humulin sliding
scale.
.
# Diarrhea - Postive for C. difficile and started on
metronidazole on [**2137-3-31**]. Should complete a 2 week course of
metronidazole (finishes [**2137-4-14**])
.
# History of fall - Patient was unable to provide details. No
apparent loss of consciousness. She may have hit her head.  Head
CT neg for bleed.
.
# COPD - Continued outpatient regimen of tiotropium,
fluticasone-salmeterol, and albuterol prn.
.
#. PPx: SC heparin, PPI, bowel regimen (pt constipated), contact
precautions for h/o MRSA, VRE, and C. difficile.
.
#. Code: FULL discussed with pt and son by [**Name (NI) 121**] 6 team. Neither
would want prolonged intubation
Son, [**Name (NI) **], is HCP:
