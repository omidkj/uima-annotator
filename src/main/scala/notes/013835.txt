Chief Complaint:
shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
This is a 68 year old female with extensive past medical history
of chronic multifactorial lung disease on 2L home O2, congenital
heart disease with large ASD s/p repair, obstructive/restrictive
lung disease, chronic pulmonary emboli, severe pulmonary
hypertension on sildenifil, presenting with progressive dyspnea.
She first noted increased SOB about one week ago, associated
with increased cough and wheezing. She was initially producing
increased [**Doctor Last Name 352**] sputum (her sputum is this color at baseline),
but over the past 2 days she has had a fairly non-productive
cough. She has been using her nebulizer machine twice a day over
the past week. She was given a prescription by her PCP for
Augmentin on [**12-17**] over the phone as the pt refused to come in to
be seen. This morning the pt felt more acutely short of breath.
She states that she is currently short of breath at rest,
whereas she normally can walk from her car into a store before
she becomes short of breath. She denies any f/c/s. She c/o
pressure at her ventral hernia site, but no chest pain. She
denies any increased leg swelling, and she is still sleeping on
only 1 pillow. She denies any blood in her sputum, sore throat,
diarrhea, or constipation. She admits to nausea today without
emesis and poor appetite for months. The pt states she has lost
15-20 lbs over the past several years.
.
She originally presented to [**Hospital6 3105**] where she
was found to have on O2 sat of 75% on 2 L NC and 86% on 6 L NC.
Her digoxin level was WNL at 0.9. She was started on BIPAP. She
received Levofloxacin 750 mg IV x1 and Solumedrol 125 mg IV x1.
She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] ED for further care.
.
In the ED, the pts vitals were: Tm 97.9 HR 95 BP 108-117/54-75 R
26 Sat 89% 4LNC. She received Levofloxacin 500 mg IV x1 and
Solumedrol 125 mg IV x1 at OSH. CXR was clear of new infiltrate.

IMAGING
LENI
No DVT in the bilateral lower extremities.
.
CXR
No acute cardiopulmonary process. Stable appearance of fibrosis
and atelectasis at the right lung base, right lung volume loss,
and cardiomegaly.
.
ECHO
The left atrium is elongated. The right atrium is moderately
dilated. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global
systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%) There is no ventricular
septal defect. The right ventricular cavity is markedly dilated
with severe global free wall hypokinesis. There is abnormal
septal motion/position consistent with right ventricular
pressure/volume overload. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic
regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild to moderate ([**11-26**]+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are
moderately thickened. Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid
regurgitation is seen. There is severe pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial
effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2164-9-20**],
the RV has further dilated and systolic function has
deteriorated. The estimated PASP has increased. The LVEF remains
normal.


Brief Hospital Course:
68F h/o 2L home O2, congenital ASD s/p repair,
obstructive/restrictive lung disease, chronic pulmonary emboli,
severe pulmonary hypertension on sildenifil, presenting with
progressive dyspnea most c/w COPD flare with a question of PNA.

# Respiratory status: The pt has had worsening symptoms over 2
weeks. She was initially admitted to the MICU, however was
called out to the floor quickly thereafter.  She had no need for
bipap or intubation this admission.  Her worsening respiratory
status was felt to be most likely secondary to a COPD flare w/
possible RLL pneumonia.  While in the hospital she had LENI's
neg for DVT bilaterally, CTA chest showed New RUL and LLL
spiculated nodules.  Primary oncologist is aware of these
findings and at this time, is holding on any further workup.  Pt
remains unaware of results.  The patient was negative for flu
and sputum, blood and urine cultures were pending at discharge.

The patient was seen by Pulmonary while in house who recommended
increasing home oxygen and restarting Combivent at home.  The
patient was continued on her inhalers with an increase in
standing albuterol and ipratropium nebs.  She was continued on
fluticasone, salmeterol, and montelukast.  She was also started
on a prednisone taper and Levofloxacin 750 mg PO Q48H (impaired
GFR) x5 days for COPD flare

For her pulmonary HTN: sildenafil TID, *** NOT [**Hospital1 **] *** (pt had
decreased frequency but should be on TID per pulmonary).  She
was continued on her PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 1102**]: Atovaquone and continued
on anticoagulation for her chronic pulmonary emboli.

# Supratheraputic INR: Admitted with INR >3, but quickly
decreasing INR
-Neg LENI, no new PE per CTA PE protocol
-Warfarin restarted at 3mg daily x 3 days per [**Hospital 197**] Clinic
RN.
.
# Chronic renal insufficiency: Cr 1.1, GFR near 50, stable
during this admission.
.
# Hyponatremia: On presentation the patient had mild
hyponatremia which resolved during her stay.

.
# Pain at ventral hernia/hiatal hernia site: This pain resolved
over course of admission.  Ventral hernia remains reducible.
The patient was treated with GI cocktail PRN (pt c/o
indigestion) and Simethicone PRN (pt c/o gas).
.
# h/o atrial fibrillation: Warfarin initially restarted at lower
than home dose  and the patient was continued on sotalol and
digoxin.
.
# Diastolic dysfunction: The patient was restarted on her home
regimen of Furosemide.  Her spironolactone was held.  The
patient was advised to discuss re
