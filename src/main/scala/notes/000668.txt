Shoulder Xray  [**10-2**]
RIGHT SHOULDER, THREE VIEWS: No fracture or dislocation is
identified. There is mild degenerative change of the
glenohumeral joint. Local evidence for several loose bodies in
the glenohumeral joint. There is mild calcific tendonitis of the
supraspinatus tendon. The visualized lung is clear.
.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of fracture.
.
CT Head [**10-2**]
IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial hemorrhage.
.
Renal U/S [**10-3**]
IMPRESSION: Multiple bilateral renal cysts. No hydronephrosis or
stones.
.
CXR [**10-3**]
Moderate cardiomegaly has progressed and maybe a slight increase
in atelectasis or new dependent left pleural effusion, but there
is not a substantial change in the radiographic appearance in
that area. Borderline interstitial edema is seen in the right
lower lung. The upper lungs are clear. Hyperinflation indicates
COPD. There is a calcified apical ventricular aneurysm. The
courses of the intended right atrial and left ventricular pacers
and right ventricular pacer defibrillator leads are unchanged.
There is no obvious discontinuity in any of the electrodes. No
pneumothorax or mediastinal widening.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 79M PMH BiV/ICD, CHF--EF 20%, CAD--s/p CABG, CRI (BL Cr 1.5
- 2), p/w ICD firing in the setting of acute renal failure.
*
CARDIAC:
A. Cor: No chest pain throughout this admission.
--Continued ASA, Bblocker, statin, ACE
*
B. Pump: EF 20%, likely [**1-1**] CAD.
Pt with a h/o CHF with an EF of 20%.  Pt on ASA/Bblocker,
statin, ACE, Aldactone, Digoxin, Lasix prior to admission.  On
admission, digoxin level supratherapeutic and patient found to
be in ARF with a Cr of 5.2 likely due to dehydration/prerenal
azotemia.  Held diuretics and Digoxin on admission.  Bblocker
was initially held due to ? decompensated CHF but was quickly
restarted and titrated up to pre-admission levels.
IVFs were started for his prerenal ARF and patient's Cr rapidly
decreased over 3 days back to his baseline Cr of [**1-1**].2.  Pt's
diuretics were restarted on HD#3, and patient continued to be
euvolemic until day of discharge.
Pt discharged on home dose of ASA, Bblocker, statin, Aldactone,
Lasix.  Digoxin continued to be held on discharge.
*
C. Rhythm: Paced rhythm, with widened QRS likely due to
hyperkalemia/acidosis on admission.  Pt felt ICD firing 4 times
at home, and called EMS to bring him to [**Hospital1 18**].  On interrogation
of his pacer by the EP team, pt was found to have been in  Vfib
arrest s/p ICD firing x10 times, with the pacer timing out afte
10 shocks.  Pt had been in vfib arrest after the 10th shock, but
spontaneously returned to NSR.
- Pt was continued on telemetry during admission.  Pt had an
episode of asymptomatic 10 beat run of NSVT on HD#2.  Pt was
counseled on his options and chose to go for VT Ablation as he
had had this procedure previously.  On HD#6, pt was taken for VT
ablation which was unsuccessful, as in the [**Name (NI) 13042**] pt had 3 runs of
NSVT that were shocked back into NSR by the patient's ICD.  Pt
at the time was on a low dose dopamine drip, and it was thought
the catecholamine action was causing the NSVT.  The drip was
d/c'ed and a lidocaine drip was started, and patient was
transferred to the CCU to be observed overnight.  There were no
issues overnight, and patient was weaned off the lidocaine drip
and transferred to the floor.  On the floor over the weekend
prior to discharge, pt had an asymptomatic 40 beat of NSVT while
ambulating with PT.  Pt was asymptomatical without any other
c/o's.  EP evaluated the patient and it was decided to add
mexiletine 150mg po bid to his current regimen of amiodarone
400mg po qD and Toprol XL 50mg qD.
- EP did not think pt needed DFT evaluation as his ICD fired
successfully 3 times in the [**Name (NI) 13042**].  On discharge, pt was sent out
on Amiodarone 400mg po qD x2 weeks --> amiodarone 200mg qday
standing dose, mexiletine 150mg po qd, and Toprol XL 50mg qD.
*
RENAL FAILURE: No apparent etiology, but likely pre-renal due to
poor PO hydration and increased BUN/Cr ratio.
- Urine lytes c/w prerenal state.  IVFs were started on
admission, and Cr decreased quickly back to baseline with his
hydration.  On HD#3, pt's Cr back to 2.1 his baseline.
- Diuretics were restarted gingerly, and titrated up to
pre-admission levels.  Creatinine increased s/p diuretic
addition to 2.7 on discharge.  Pt will follow creatinine levels
as outpatient with PCP.
[**Name Initial (NameIs) **] [**Name11 (NameIs) **] sign of volume overload during this admission - euvolemic
on discharge.
*
ANEMIA:
- Pt's hct on admission 35, decreased to 30 on HD#2 thought
likely to hydration from a hemoconcentrated state.  However on
HD#4, pt's hct decreased to 26 and with his CAD h/o, was
transfused 1u pRBC which increased his hct to 35 post
transfusion.  Hct 28 on discharge.
- Pt had iron studies, vit b12, folate studies which showed MCV
97, Ferritin 67, on feso4 325 qd, nml vit b12, folate levels.
Iron was continued during this admission.  It was thought that
likely CRI contributing to chronic anemia.
- Pt with hct of 28 on discharge, stable x3 days.
*
COPD: PRN albuterol, o2 as needed.  No intervention needed this
admission.
*
DISPO: Full Code. Pt was evaluated by PT/OT who thought due to
his unsteadiness as well as his primary responsibility of caring
for his wife, who is currently in rehab herself, pt would
benefit from rehab stay.  Pt was sent to rehab s/p EPS/VT
ablation.
