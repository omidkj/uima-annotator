Chief Complaint:
B/L Debilitating intermittent claudication
Ischemic rest pain in her right foot


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Aortobifemoral bypass with 12 x 6 aortobifemoral femoral Dacron
graft.


History of Present Illness:
This 57-year-old lady has had severe debilitating intermittent
claudication of both her extremities for quite some time. She
recently developed ischemic rest pain in her right foot. A CT
angiogram was done which showed her infrarenal aorta to be open
with total occlusion of her left iliac system from the aortic
bifurcation to the groin, and a patent right common iliac
artery, but a totally occluded right external iliac artery. She
reconstituted common femoral arteries with patent superficial
femoral arteries distally. Because of her young
age and her severe symptoms, she has been recommended to have
bypass surgery.

Brief Hospital Course:
Pt underwent aortobifemoral bypass on [**3-5**].  During surgery she
developed rapid SVT, hypotension and hypoxia, cardioverted with
restoration of a sinus brady and stabilized- possible protamine
rxn; she was kept intubated and sedated overnight.

Cardiology-Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] consulted. Echo obtained

POD 1: Patient extubated. Lopressor continued. Palpable DP
pulses. Remained in ICU- metabolic acidosis and T wave inversion
on ECG. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] following patient for possible silent ischemia
in setting of SVT/ operative procedure. T wave inversion
resolved.
POD 2: VSS, pain controlled with MSO4 PCA. Diet advanced to
sips. Diuresis, OOB.
POD 3: Transient desaturation to 87% on 3L NC. Denies SOB. Chest
x-ray showing pulmonary congestion and right pleural effusion.
Lasix X 2 given . CTA to r/o PE performed. Negative for PE. CTA
showing mucous plug with total RLL collapse. Patient remained in
VICU, aggressive pulmonary toilet. Bronchoscopy performed.
POD 4: No overnight events, breathing improved. Psychiatry
consulted as patient is requesting DNR/DNI. patient deemed
competent and DNI ordered. Ambulating on oxygen with physical
therapy.
POD 5: VSS. No overnight events. Ambulating with physical
therapy not requiring oxygen. O2 sats >93% on room air and while
ambulating. Levaquin discontinued.
POD 6: VSS. No overnight events. B/L palpable DP/PT pulses.
