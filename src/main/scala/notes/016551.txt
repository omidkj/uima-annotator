Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2290**]
Chief Complaint:
Hypotension and hypoxia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
Briefly, Mr. [**Known lastname 20400**] is a 51 yo M with a h/o diastolic heart
failure, diabetes mellitus, COPD, tobacco use, alcohol abuse,
cryptogenic organizing pneumonia on chronic steroids since
[**2-/2136**], pulmonary emboli off coumadin [**3-6**] GI bleed,
hypertension, tracheobronchomalacia, morbid obesity, and
difficult intubation with recent hospitalization for shoulder
pain s/p fall who was found to be hypotensive and hypoxic (SBPs
in the 70s and SaO2 88%) on follow up clinic visit in the
setting of abrupt cessation of steroids for cryptogenic
organizing PNA (decreased from 25/day x 5 days to 5/day). Also
has been noncompliant with medications, 20 lb weight gain
recently.
.
ED course: VS were BP 72/46, HR 79, rr 15 O2 94%. He received
vanc and zosyn x1 for presumed bilateral lower extremity
cellulitis.  CXR was clear, sats progressively decreased to 86%
on 5L, improving to 99% on NRB, received 10 mg of decadron for
presumed adrenal insufficiency, had ARF with Cr of 3.9 from
baseline of 0.9 with good UOP, hyponatremia (129), troponin
negative x2, EKG with NSR and no ST changes.  There was concern
for pulmonary emboli, especially given past history but no CTA
was performed due to ARF and no heparin gtt started.  He was
started on levophed and transferred to the MICU.
.
MICU course:
Initial vitals were T98, BP110/68, P85, O2 99%NRB.
Hypotension: Levophed was discontinued (SBP increased to 190s
briefly) and SBP stabilized in 110s after dexamethasone, 1L IVF,
and vanc/cef x1. Thus, hypotension was felt most likely due to
adrenal insufficiency. He was started on stress dose steroids
(hydrocort 100 Q8H) and tapered to prednisone 50 mg QD the
following day. Cortisol was 12 on morning of transfer to regular
floor.
Hypoxia: Felt due to acute respiratory acidosis and acute
metabolic alkalosis from worsening chronic lung disease in
setting of rapid steroid taper vs. volume overload (proBNP 106,
>99% NPV, though morbidly obese).  Autodiuresesd 1.7L in ICU
with no diuretics.  D-dimer slightly elevated at 630. LENIs were
negative for DVT. Chest CT w/o contrast showed no change (wet
read). He was weaned to 2L NC with sats in low 90s. O2 sats
increased to high 80s/low 90s on room air.
Renal failure: Likely ATN given FeNa 3.5. Treated with IVF. ACEi
and spironolactone were held. UOP remained good and Cr trended
down from 3.9 on admission to 2.3 on transfer.
Hyponatremia: Improved from 129 to 134 with IVF, steroids. Hct
remained stable.
Cellulitis (chronic) treated with vanc and cefepime.  He
remained afebrile.
Also, the patient was noted to have asterixis, normal LFTs, and
known EtOH abuse so he was started on CIWA scale with diazepam,
gabapentin and lower dose narcotics (given recent hypotension).
.
On transfer, Mr. [**Known lastname 72546**] vitals were P87 BP 117/66 RR20 O293%
on 2L
.
On the floor VS were T 97.2, P79 BP 115/52 RR18 SaO2 94% on 2L
NC
