confusion, headache

none


History of Present Illness:
[**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname **] is a 53 year-old woman who was brought into the ED by
her husband after she was confused and not making sense this
morning at home. She has a notable history of paraplegia
secondary to motor-vehicle accident in [**2142**] with T1/2 cord
injury. She was recently hospitalized from [**4-14**] - [**4-16**] after
she developed yellow productive sputum with a likely right lower
lobe consolidation. She was treated w/ Vancomycin, cefepime and
azithromycin for a healthcare associated pneumonia (HCAP) and
discharged on [**4-16**]. She was also found to have a multidrug
resistant klebsiella UTI and was started on Vanc/Zosyn for a 14
day course.

Her husband and primary caregiver at home felt that the evening
prior to admission she was at her baseline which they describe
as
communicative, pleasant and with mobility in her upper
extremities. On [**4-20**] she awoke stating that she had a bad
headache (further description unobtainable) and she was no
longer
making sense. She continued to repeat phrases and was not
following commands. She was brought into the ED. During her time
in the ED she was noted to have a seizure for around 1 minute
which consisted of deviation of the head to the right with eyes
to the right. She also had tonic contraction of both arms. This
resolved spontaneously and was then given 2 mg of Versed (hx of
adverse reaction to Ativan). Her caregiver reports that she had
one seizure in the past, around 1 year ago in the setting of
multiple medication discontinuation (including - baclofen).

She also has a history of PRES in the setting of a MICU
admission
in [**2147-12-3**] in which systolic blood pressures were greater than
160s. She had binocular vision loss during the episode and MRI
with occipital lobe FLAIR hyperintensities.

She is unable to provide any additional history. Her husband
states that at home her blood pressure typically run in the
90s-110s systolic.


Past Medical History:
# T1 to T2 paraplegia status post a motor vehicle accident.
# Recurrent pneumonia (followed by pulm - Last [**2149-4-9**])

issues secondary to neuromuscular disease with improvement with
consistent and aggressive bronchopulmonary therapy.

straight catheterization

Imaging studies:
.
[**2150-4-20**]
CT_HEAD
IMPRESSION: Significant motion artifact limits evaluation. White
matter
hypodensity in the left parietal lobe may represent sequela of
prior event of PRES.
.
NOTE ADDED AT ATTENDING REVIEW: Although the left frontal
hypodensity might be a sequelum of prior PRES, the MR
examination of [**2147-12-29**] did not demonstrate abnormality in
this location. Further, there is loss of grey white contrast,
but no atrophy, as might be expected if this were an old lesion.
These findings raise concern of acute-subacute infarction, or
perhaps swelling after a seizure. MR is recommended for further
evaluation. This revised interpretation was noticed at 5:25 pm,
and discussed by telephone, by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 22924**]
of the Emergency Department at 5:30pm.

[**2150-4-19**]
EEG
IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal portable EEG due to the presence
of
frequent left temporal and left hemisphere sharp and slow wave
discharges occurring for a few seconds at a time at 1 Hz
indicative of
an epileptogenic focus in this region. However, the study was
severely
limited by abundant and frequent movement artifact during the
majority
of the study, and the rightsided electrodes were most severely
affected. The background was otherwise slow and disorganized
reaching
up to a maximum of [**6-7**] Hz posteriorly indicative of a moderate
to
severe encephalopathy. Given the above findings, we suggest 24
bedside
EEG monitoring for further diagnosis.

[**2150-4-24**]
CT-HEAD
IMPRESSION: Hypodensities in bilateral occipital, left temporal,
and left
frontal lobes are not significantly changed since the prior
exam, and may
represent PRES
