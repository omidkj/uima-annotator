Brief Hospital Course:
Assessment and Plan: 71 yo F h/o LBP with compression fractures
presenting with 10/10 back pain.
.
# Lower Back Pain: Likely related to compression fractures as
seen on x-ray. Initially admitted for pain control. Given her
serious allergies, she was not given strong pain medication. She
was given acetaminophen, lidocaine [**Last Name (LF) 18539**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] gay and 25 mg of
ultram every six hours as needed. This appeared to moderately
control her pain. On the first night of admission, she was
started on Gabapentin 300 mg given this may be related to
neuropathic pain. The following morning, the patient appeared
confused and at times lethargic. An ABG showed patient had
hypercapnic respiratory failure. Patient with known history of
OSA with pulmonary hypertension. Patient stated on admission she
did not use CPAP at night, but on further questioning with
family the following day, she does use this machine. It was felt
that the combination of not using CPAP the night prior and
possibly Gabapentin could have contributed to this event. She
was transferred to the MICU for BiPAP. During her MICU course,
she developed fever and found to have Moraxella pneumonia
confirmed by sputum culture. She was started on levofloxacin.
Her respiratory status improved, she was weaned off of BiPAP and
transferred back to the medical floor. She continued to use CPAP
at night and did not have further episodes of this.

# Atrial Fibrillation: Patient was noted to have three episodes
of afib with RVR to 150s. Each time she was given 10 mg IV dilt
x 2 which broke her fast rate. Diltiazem was uptitrated to 90 mg
[**First Name3 (LF) **]. She was noted the night of this uptitration to have brief
rates into the 20s-30s. She was asymptomatic and asleep during
these episodes. Upon waking, her HR improved. Since her heart
rate ranged from bradycardia to tachycardia, and a concern for
further intervention may need to be pursued EP was consulted. It
was felt no intervention should be done during this
hospitalization, since she does have an active infection. She
was continued on metoprolol and diltiazem, and will follow up
closely with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 171**] in the outpatient.  She was noted to
have a supratherapeutic INR (4.1) and coumadin was held while
until her INR was at goal. Of note, she became subtherapeutic to
1.8 [**1-19**], but once warfarin was restarted, she became
therapeutic throughout the rest of the hospitalization.

# Acute on Chronic diastolic CHF: Upon ambulation her O2sats
would decrease to 88% on Room air. Crackles notable on exam and
chest x-ray consistent with marked pulmonary edema. This was
felt due diastolic dysfunction. This may have been exacerbated
in the setting of afib with RVR. Her home lasix dosage was
increased to 80 [**Hospital1 **] and she would intermittently receive 80 IV
lasix to help with further diuresis. Upon [**Hospital1 **] she was
breathing at room air in the mid-90s and upon ambulation
saturate 90% on room air. She was felt to be euvolemic.

# Acute on Chronic Kidney Disease: With aggressive diuresis, her
creatinine increased to 1.8, but upon [**Hospital1 **] decreased to
1.3, which is in her baseline range.

# DMT2: continue 70/30 40 units q AM and 25 units q hs plus
HISS. Glipizide was held while inpatient, but restarted upon
[**Hospital1 **].

# HTN: Stable. Continued metoprolol and diltiazem as above.

# Hypothyroidism: Continued levothyroxine.

# HLD: Continued lipitor and fenofibrate.
