Service:  #58
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 79 year-old
female with a past medical history significant for dementia
and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, status post
pneumonectomy for lung cancer, hypertension.  The patient was
noted to be less active and with decreased po intake over
to [**Hospital 1474**] Hospital for evaluation by her husband on
[**2149-12-8**].  According to outside records, the patient
denied symptoms of chest pain, shortness of breath, nausea,
vomiting, neck pain, arm pain, abdominal pain until she
arrived at the [**Hospital1 1474**] Emergency Department at which time
she did complain of chest pain.  The patient was seen by the
Cardiology Service there and had evidence of an evolving
inferior and right-ventricular myocardial infarction with ST
depressions in leads
2, 3, AVF, V1, V3.  The patient was hypotensive to a blood
pressure of 70/30, which  responded to intravenous fluids
after which her blood pressure rose to 100/60.  The patient
required Dopamine intravenous to maintain her blood pressure
as well as intravenous fluids.  An echocardiogram was done at
[**Hospital 1474**] Hospital demonstrating a akinetic and hypokinetic
right ventricle.  Urgent cardiac catheterization was deferred
initially due to comorbid conditions and risks.  The
patient's peak CPK was 3777 on [**12-8**] at 1:00 p.m., CKMB
was greater then 300 at that time.

Per the patient's family request, the patient was
transferred to [**Hospital1 69**] for
further care on [**2149-12-9**].  The patient was no longer
on a Dopamine drip, but apparently was complaining of some
residual chest pain and was therefore admitted to the
Coronary Care Unit.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1.  Status post cholecystectomy.  2.
History of Lithium toxicity.  3.  Dementia.  4.  Chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease.  5.  Lung cancer status post
left pneumectomy in [**2138**].  6.  Hypertension.  7.  Bipolar
disorder.  8.  History of gastrointestinal bleed.

ALLERGIES:  Sulfa drugs.

MEDICATIONS ON TRANSFER:  Aspirin 325 mg po q.d., Lipitor 40
mg po q.d., Lopressor 25 mg po q.d., Colace 100 mg po b.i.d.,
Plavix 75 mg po q.d., Risperdal .5 mg po q.h.s., Tylenol prn,
Serax 15 to 30 mg po t.i.d. prn, Gatifloxacin for presumed
pneumonia, Pepcid.

LABORATORY ON ADMISSION:  White blood cell count 16,
hematocrit 26.9 (decreased from 37 to 31 at outside
hospital), platelets 186, sodium 33, potassium 4.1,
creatinine 2.2, glucose 83, PTT 28.  Cardiac enzymes, on
[**2149-12-7**] CPK was 1277 with CKMB of 198 (MB index of
15.5) troponin greater then 50.  On [**2149-12-8**] CPK was
2677, CKMB greater then 300.  On [**2149-12-8**] CPK 3777
with CKMB greater then 300, troponin of 7.9.  On [**12-8**],
CPK was 3653 with CKMB of 212, troponin of 5.8.  On [**2149-12-9**] CPK was 2736, CKMB 101, troponin of 3.7.
Echocardiogram from outside hospital done on [**12-8**] was
as follows, ejection fraction was grossly normal (45%),
dilated right ventricle, inferior wall hypokinesis, no
effusions, normal valves.  Electrocardiogram on [**2149-12-8**] showing normal sinus rhythm at 100 beats per minute, [**Street Address(2) 12501**] elevations in 3 and AVF, [**Street Address(2) 1766**] depressions in 1 and
AVL.  Electrocardiogram on [**2149-12-10**] showing normal
sinus rhythm at 100 beats per minute, low voltages, flattened
or inverted T waves throughout (accept increase in 1 and
AVL), normal intervals, Q waves in 3, V1 to V2, AVR.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The impression was that this is a 79
year-old female with baseline dementia status post
pneumonectomy presenting from [**Hospital 1474**] Hospital with an
inferior myocardial infarction about 48 hours old, and renal
insufficiency.

1.  Cardiovascular:  A: Ischemia, the patient was status post
inferior wall myocardial infarction at [**Hospital 1474**] Hospital with
CPK now trending down.  The patient's CKs continued to be
cycled and showed a pattern of downward trend.  The patient
was continued on aspirin, Plavix, low dose beta blockade,
Lipitor.  The patient was given intravenous fluids for right
ventricular support given her recent RV infarction.  As the
patient was hemodynamically stable on admission, there was no
initial indication for invasive monitoring.  It was
determined that the patient should go for a cardiac
catheterization.  A cardiac catheterization was performed
showing 90% diffuse stenosis of the right coronary artery.
Thrombectomy was performed with stent to right coronary
artery with subsequent restoration of flow, 50% left anterior
descending coronary artery lesion.  Other disease was
diffuse, there was still some residual laminated thrombus
after the procedure.

The patient was transferred back to the Coronary Care Unit
after the procedure as intracardiac hemodynamic monitoring
showed pulmonary artery oxygen saturation of 43%, pulmonary
artery pressure of 33/17, right ventricular pressure of
33/11, with an estimated cardiac index of less then 2.  The
patient was monitored for 24 hours and was stable requiring
less intravenous fluid support.  The patient had no further
episodes of chest pain after intervention.  The patient was
noted to be wheezing during her hospital course.  As the
patient was not previously on a beta blocker prior to this
hospitalization the beta blocker was discontinued as it was
presumed to be possible cause of her wheezing.  The patient's
Captopril was titrated up to 25 mg po t.i.d. for optimal
blood pressure control.  The patient was also placed on
Digoxin for optimizing cardiac output.

B:  Pump, the patient was initially given aggressive
intravenous fluid for right ventricular support status post
right ventricular infarct, with caution to avoid fluid
overload.  After cardiac catheterization the patient's blood
pressure remained stable off intravenous fluid support and
was therefore discontinued.

2.  Hematology:  The patient was transfused one unit of
packed red blood cells for a hematocrit drop from 28.6 to 27
after cardiac catheterization.  The patient's hematocrit
remained stable after transfusion.  Hemolysis laboratories
were negative.  The patient's stool guaiac was subsequently
reported to be positive (no gross blood or melana), the
decision was made to follow up with outpatient colonoscopy.

3.  Infectious disease:  The patient was started on
Gatifloxacin at outside hospital without documentation for
the reason, besides an elevated white blood cell count at the
outside hospital.  The patient was continued on renally dosed
Levaquin during her hospital stay.  The patient spiked a
temperature once to 101 during her hospital course.  All
cultures were negative with chest x-ray showing no
infiltrates and urinalysis showing no signs of infection.
The Levaquin was subsequently discontinued secondary to a
rash on the patient's back, after having finished a seven day
course.

4.  Renal:  The patient was given intravenous fluid as
necessary to maintain renal perfusion and at the same time to
avoid congestive heart failure.  All medications were renally
dosed.

5.  Fluids, electrolytes:  The patient's electrolytes were
repleted prn, and the patient was placed on Protonix for
gastrointestinal prophylaxis.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  The patient is stable.  The patient is
going to short term rehab facility to follow up with primary
care physician, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**First Name (STitle) 17385**] within two w
