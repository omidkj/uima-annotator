Brief Hospital Course:
76 yo F with lupus nephritis, CKD on HD, CAD s/p CABG, HTN,
rectro-vag fistula who presented from PCP with acute respiratory
distress.

# Hypoxia:  This had resolved by the time she came to the floor.
 DDx includes infection, hypervolemia, CHF exacterbation.
Unclear cause, not vol o/l on exam or on imaging, CT without
clear consolidation though patchy infiltrates with ground glass
opacities. Got CTX, levo and vanc in ED. UTI on UA, Bactermia on
BCX. SIRS physiology could precipitate acute respiratory
distress that quickly resolved with IVF and abx. Unlikely that
PNA would resolve so fast.  CHF not likely as improved with
fluids.  Gas 7.41/44/290 on NRB. Patient was initially on 4L
nasal cannula but weaned smooth to room air within 1.5-2 days.
Patient was initially treated with Vanc/cipro/flagyl and when
blood cultures grew our GNR/GPR likely clostridium vs. bacillus,
infectious disease recommended Vanc/Cipro/Meropenem.  This was
narrowed to vanc/ceftaz/flagyl after speciation.  Respiratory
status greatly improved after fluid removal at HD.
.
Bacteremia:
Clostridium Perfringens, E. Coli, proteus, and strep viridans
were isolated from her blood as well as providencia from her
urine. Her source was likely the RV fistula, especially in
setting of rectal bleeding in ED. She was initially on
vanc/cipro/[**Last Name (un) 2830**], however once cultures and sensitivities were
identified she was switched to vanc/ceftaz/flagyl for dosing at
HD. Her RV fistula was found to be nonsurgical on consult.
Surveilance cultures turned negative quickly.
.
Plan going forward:
-Continue to dose Vanc/Ceftaz at HD for a total of a 4 week
course
-Continue PO flagyl for 4 week course
.
# Hypotension: Septic shock was most likely etiolgy with UTI and
high grade bacteremia as precipitating event. Unclear what
baseline bp's are, but 90-100 on floor.  Prior notes with bp
120-140's, and given CRF, likely runs higher. Got 1L in ED,
looked hemoconcentrated on hct.  Consider hypovolemia with hct
drop, though less likely, no acute s/sx significant bleeding.
Patient was initially bolused gently given her
dialysis-dependent state, although she does make some urine.
Patient was kept on antibiotic course per above. Urine culture
also ultimately grew out GNR >100,000. Patient's
anti-hypertensives were initially held. She was restarted on low
dose metoprolol. She eventually became normotensive with IV abx.
.
# Thrombocytopenia: She has known thrombocytopenia (likely [**2-22**]
lupus) which has been slowly decreasing over years and was
around 90's in [**2100**]. On admission it was 44 and nadired at 35K
with stopping her heparin and treating her sepsis this increased
and stabilized in the 50's. Hematology/Oncology saw patient in
the MICU and recommended serologies to evaluate for heparin
induced thrombocytopenia which was negative.  We continued to
hold her heparin in the setting of thrombocytopenia.
Differential includes sepsis induced marrow suppresion, MDS in
this older patient.
.
Plan going forward:
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1968**] to arrange follow-up with Hem-onc
.
# CRF: Cr slightly up from baseline, likely slightly
hemoconcentrated initially. Responded well to gentle
rehydration. patient underwent hemodialysis on her home T/Th/Sat
schedule with no issues. Continue renagel, iron and renal diet.
.
# Rectal Bleeding/Anemia:  Hct to 35 on repeat after blood found
during PR tylenol dosing.  Known hemorrhoids.  GI was made
aware, no acute need for scoping given this is a chronic issue
and patient's hematocrit remained stable. Given her coronary
artery disease, transfusion goal 30.  She never required
transfusion and her hct was 38 on the day of discharge.
.
# Lupus: Continued plaquenil, prednisone
.
# Gout: Continued home allopurinol
.
# HTN: Restarted on metoprolol 6.25mg
.
# CAD: s/p CABG, continue home meds of statin, ASA, Plavix.
Holding BB as above.
