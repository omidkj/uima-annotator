Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 783**]
Chief Complaint:
Seizure

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Placement of left femoral central venous catheter
Placement of left subclavian central venous catheter
Lumbar Puncture


History of Present Illness:
35 yo female w/med hx of DMI and multiple admissions for DKA, DM
complicated by nephropathy on PD and multiple skin infections,
HTN, asthma initially admitted to the MICU [**1-13**] for witnessed
seizure. Daughter reported to find her seizing with rhythmic arm
and leg movements so EMS called. Pt given valium 10mg with
resolution. Pt had 2 other episodes of seizure in ambulance and
another in the ED. She also had multiple episodes of coffee
ground emesis in the ED so GI was consulted and recommended [**Hospital1 **]
PPI and watch since hct stable and hs of gastritis in the past.
Chem 7 revealed her to be in DKA with a gap of 18 and
hyprglycemic to 600's. She was started on an insulin gtt which
was continued for 48 hours although AG within 7 hours of
starting gtt. Head CT revealed left convexity subdural hematoma.
VS were stable in the ED and pt was transferred to the MICU for
DKA, seizure and SDH. She was evaluated by neurology who
reported pt to have multiple medical reasons to have seizure and
recommended dilantin loading until medical issues controlled.
Neurosurgery was also consulted for SDH but recommended frequent
neuro checks and no need for surgical intervention. Follow-up
MRI revealed foci of signal abnormalities in both frontal lobes,
right greater than left, with faint enhancement of the right
frontal lobe lesion with differential including demyelinating
disorder or infection. LP was attempted on [**1-15**] but aborted due
to pt intolerance. She also continued to have abdominal pain
with elevated WBC so peritoneal fluid was sent for cell count
and cx with cx pending and cell count w/o leukocytosis.
Renal was following and TPA'd PD catheter with good response on
[**1-16**] with 5L of drainage and improvement in pain. Once off
insulin gtt and monitored with frequent neuro checks for 48
hours she was transferred to the floor.

Brief Hospital Course:
1. seizure-Pt has no hx of seizure in past but has multiple
reasons for seizure on current admission including hyponatremia,
subdural hematoma, acidemia and new med of flagyl and
hypodensity seen on MRI. She was dilantin loaded but developed
dizinees with uptitration despite subtherapeutic levels although
free % was elevated likely due to CRF. Pt started on Keppra so
that dilantin toxicity would not cloud the diziness and ataxia
picture. Dilantin was then titrated off. Hypodensity on MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 108356**]g for cause of seizure focus if infection or
demyelinating lesion although LP showed no WBC's, [**Male First Name (un) 2326**] virus neg,
cytology neg and no oligoclonal bands seen. RPR neg ruled out
neurosyphillis. She suffered no additional seizures and will
continue on keppra with plans to follow up with neurology in
about 1 month.
2. headaches: Pt's headache was initially felt to be most likely
post LP headache and we reconsulted anaesthesia for blood patch,
but they felt that her symptoms were more consistent with
migaraine. Attempted SC sumitriptan to decrese HA frequency
altough it made her more nauseous. She was eventually managed
with RTC tylenol and oxycodone prn. Repeat MR w/o gadolinium
shows no change with possible decrease in size of frontal
hyperintensities. As above pt will follow up with neuro.
3. SDH- size of SDH stable on follow-up MRI and not viusa
