[**First Name3 (LF) **]


History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 84164**] is an 87yo F with a h/o meningioma resected x 2 (15
& 30yrs ago), VP drain in place, h/o sz, who presented to [**Hospital1 **] with at least 1 day of fevers and confusion.  History is
gleened from records as she is intubated and sedated.  She saw
her PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**2157-12-29**], where she reportedly collapsed and was
hypotensive and unresponsive.  She was taken to the [**Hospital3 **]
ED, where she had a temperature of 102.3 F, BP in the 90s down
to the 80s, HR in the 90s, and she was intubated for airway
protection.  She was given peripheral dopamine in the ED there,
which unfortunately infiltrated her antecubital fossa
bilaterally.
.
She was admitted to the ICU, where her WBC went from 8.7 on
[**2157-12-29**] to 56.4 on [**12-30**] with 41 bands.  2/2 blood cultures are
growing GNR and her urine is growing lactose fermenting GNRs.
She also had tbili of 3.0 (2.8 before transfer), an ALP of 396
--> 220, ALT 419 --> 311, AST 509 --> 287, amylase 641, and
lipase 3811.  A CT abdomen showed dilation of her CBD and
intrahepatic ducts. GI was consulted who felt she had
cholangitis due to biliary obstruction.  She was started on
ceftriaxone, levo, and vanc.  ID was consulted who recommending
covering for urospesis and aspiration pna, and flagyl was added
when the obstructed picture arouse.  The dopamine was changed to
norepi and rapidly weans in the MICU.  She was levo, ceftaz, and
flagyl by transfer. She is being transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] for
possible [**Hospital1 **] since that is not done at [**Hospital3 **] on the
weekends.
.
Other results from [**Hospital3 **] are notable for a bicarb dropping
from 27 on [**12-29**] to 18 on [**12-30**], a lactate of 5.4 trending down to
2.6, and CE bump of troponin to 0.17 trending down to 0.08 (peak
0.17 at 0100 on [**12-30**]), CPK of 299 trending down to 211 (peak 299
at 0100 on [**12-30**]), and CK-MB which peaked at 5.1 at noon on the
day of transfer.  Her increased cardiac enzymes were thought to
be due to demand ischemia.  Her EKG was noted as no acute
changes.
.
She was also given 5mg of IV vitamin K and 5mg PO for INR 1.6.
Her HCT dropped from 42 to 32 during her stay, felt [**1-17**]
hemodilution.
.
She had an EEG for her LOC, which showed no seizure activity.
CT head is reported as no acute change and meningioma and
slit-like ventricles.  Neurology there recommended starting
keppra.  It was noted that she refused a shunt replacement a few
years ago.
.
Prior to transfer, her mechanical ventilation was PSV15/5, FiO2
35%, and small lung volumes.  ABG prior to transfer on PSV 15/5
30% FiO2 TV 400 was 7.40/24/325/14.3.

MICU events significant for:
On [**12-31**] AM she underwent [**Month/Year (2) **] showing biliary ostruction but no
cholangitis.  While intubated she remained obtunded, not
following commands. [**1-2**] blood cultures from [**Hospital3 2568**] showed
Klebsiella resistant to ampicillin and pan-sensitive E coli.
She was changed from keppra back to tegretol, associated with
significant improvement in her mentation.  She was then
extubated but had copious respiratory secretions requiring
frequent suctioning.  Also received IVF for pleural effusion.
Code status after discussion with patient's daughter was also
changed to DNR/DNI.
.
Patient is very difficult to communicate with currently, as she
is hypophonic and Polish is her primary language.  She however
seems to understand English.  Her main complaint is that she
"wants her ring and watch now."  I spoke with her daughter
[**Name (NI) 84165**], who states that her mother is much improved today in
terms of alertness and is uncomfortable due to her pressure sore
on her back.

CT HEAD [**2157-12-29**] OSH:
1. No acute hemorrhage or extra-axial fluid collection
2. essentially stable appearance of the left cerebellopontine
mass since [**2154-9-4**]
3. interval resolution of the ventricular dilatation. Slit-like
appearance of the ventricles suggests possible CSF hypotension.
4. Mastoid sinus disease.
.
CT abd/pelvis [**2157-12-30**] OSH:
Marked intrahepatic and extrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation
without a focal lesion within the pacrease or near the ampulla.
Tiny focus of air seen adjacent to the ampulla could represent a
duodenal diverticulum however a perforated duodenal ulcer cannot
be completely excluded.  Large focus of extraluminal air seen
adjacent to small bowel within the right inguinal hernia (most
likely represents air within the bladder secondary to a foley
catheter).  Bilateral lower lob consolidation or atelectasis
with small bilateral pleural effusions.
