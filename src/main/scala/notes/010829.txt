Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 30062**]
Chief Complaint:
Hemoptysis.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
1. Embolization of left upper bronchial artery
2. Intubation
3. Right IJ central venous line placement

History of Present Illness:
67 yo M h/o CAD, CHF, presented to the ED with hemoptysis. He
was initially c/o sob and saw his PCP 10 days prior. He was
empirically started on levofloxacin after a CXR showed concern
for PNA. 5 days prior to presentation he began to cough dark
blood. He saw his PCP who set him up for a chest CT. This has
not been performed yet. His hemoptysis progressively worsened to
the point of coughing up blood continously. Since he wasn't
feeling well, he decided to go to the [**Location (un) 620**] ED. In [**Location (un) 620**],
intial vital signs were 98.7 92 18 80/53 91% which decreased to
88% on RA, ultimately placed on a non-rebreather with
improvement of his oxygenation. His Hct was 39.9.

In ED VS were 98.6 97/64 90 24 99% on Non-rebreather which was
ultimately weaned down to 3 liters. He became hypotensive with
sbp in the 90s and was started on levophed. Hct was 31.5. A
right IJ was placed. He was transfused 2 units of prbcs. He was
started on cefepime and azithromycin. non-con Ct showed
Extensive consolidation involving the left upper lobe. Left
hilar adenopathy. Small airway impaction with secretions. No
definite mass seen was seen. VS prior to transfer: 98.5 119/78
25 95% 3L

On the floor, patient is complaining of left sided chest pain
that is sharp and worse with inspiration. It developed after
coughing. Mildly relieved with IV morphine. 1 SL NTG did not
help. no EKG changes.

[**2147-8-29**] EKG: sinus rhythm at rate of 86. normal axis. q waves in
inferior leads c/w old inferior MI. Normal intervals.

[**2147-8-29**] CT CHEST w/o CONTRAST:
1. Extensive consolidation involving the left upper lobe with
reactive mediastinal and left hilar lymphadenopathy. These
findings have progressively worsened since the earlier chest
radiograph of [**2147-8-16**] and are highly concerning for pneumonia.
No definite masses are detected on this non-contrast study.
Recommended continued followup until resolution.
2. Small left pleural effusion.
3. Bilateral apical predominant centrilobular emphysema.

[**2147-8-29**] CXR:
1. The right internal jugular central venous catheter tip
terminates in the SVC.
2. Findings concerning for left upper lobe pneumonia.
3. Suboptimal study for assessing for pneumothorax as the lung
apices are excluded from the field of view.

[**2147-8-31**] CXR:
As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has been
intubated. There is complete intubation of the right main
bronchus. Subsequent volume loss of the left lung, where the
pre-existing perihilar opacity has not changed. However, there
is now extensive retrocardiac opacity. Newly appeared
parenchymal opacity at the bases of the right upper lobe,
potentially related to volume loss.

[**2147-9-1**] Bilateral lower extremity ultrasound:
No evidence of DVT. Left [**Hospital Ward Name 4675**] cyst.

Brief Hospital Course:
67 year-old man who presented with hemoptysis and transient
hypotension with concern for lung mass.

# Hemoptysis: His hematocrit at [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**], where he initially
presented, was 39.9 with a blood pressure of 80/53. He was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**], ultimately received 2 units of prbcs,
central line was placed and transiently started on levophed
which was quickly weaned off after volume resuscitation. He
required no further blood products. He underwent rigid
bronchoscopy, biopsy performed and could not stop the bleeding.
He was sent to IR from IP suite and is s/p embolization of left
upper bronchial artery branches. He remained right mainstem
intubated after bronch overnight. A repeat flex bronch was
performed bedside the following morning and no signs of active
bleeding were present. The tube was pulled back to trachea and
he was quickly extubated the same day without incident. He
continued to have a profound cough with scant amounts of rusty
colored sputum. This was controlled with PO codeine and
lidocaine nebulizers. He also required supplemental oxygen with
a shovel mask initially, which was weaned down to 5 liters NC
prior to transfer to the floor. Over the course of the next
several days, he was weaned down to room air. With ambulation,
he was noted to have desaturations to ~88%, quickly resolving
after rest. Nevertheless, it was felt best to discharge him with
home oxygen as a temporizing measure - until he is able to clear
his airways fully of old blood and secretions.

He was empirically treated with ceftriaxone and azithromycin for
presumed CAP. He completed a five-day course of azithromycin in
house and will take two more days of cefpodoxime.

(As a note, pulmonary embolism was considered as an etiology for
his hemoptysis and hypoxia - during this admission, lower
extremity dopplers were done which were negative for DVT.
Furthermore, his oxygenation improved rapidly after transfer
from the intensive care unit - in tandem with resolution of
hemoptysis and clearing of secretions/old blood. CTA was
deferred even after his renal function improved because of his
improvin
