Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2736**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest Pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
1. Cardiac Catheterization
2. Emergent vascular surgery with ligation of inferior
epigastric artery and evacuation of right groin/pelvic hematoma

History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 76-year-old female transferred from the [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 3075**]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 3549**] Hospital ER on the evening of [**2139-11-4**] with chest pain
radiating to her right posterior shoulder area. Initial EKG had
some non-specific ST changes concerning for NSTEMI and EF per
ECHO (TTE) done at OSH noted to be 15%.  Per outside hospital
records the patient had reported that her pain was relieved
after SL nitroglycerin tablets x 3 and Lopressor 5mg IV x 3. She
was also given a loading dose of Plavix 600mg in the ER and 75mg
the following morning and she was started on both Integrillin
and Heparin and was transferred directly to the cardiac
catheterization lab at [**Hospital1 18**] and found to not have any
obstructive coronary disease, LV-gram showing EF closer to 30%
but prominent apical ballooning consistent with Takotsubo's
Cardiomyopathy presentation. She began to have severe
hypotension during her cardiac catheterization and was started
on Dopamine then switched to Neosynephrine. She was noted to
have an expanding right groin. Of note, given reported
difficulty obtaining access initially thought was that she was
having a iatrogenic bleed.
.
In the operating room the patient was continued on
Neosynephrine, and had a right internal jugular central venous
line placed and failed attempt at a radial arterial line.
Intubation was uncomplicated. The patient was also given a total
of 3.5L of NS and 2 Units blood were given. Just prior to going
to the operating room with the vascular surgery team the patient
was also given IVFs and 2 Units of blood in cardiac
catheterization lab. Thus, she received in total, 4 Units of
blood before transfer up to CCU post-operatively. She was able
to be slowly weaned off of Neosynephrine and BP was 115/70 upon
presentation to the CCU. Per vascular team, the inferior
epigastric artery on the right was ligated and a hematoma was
evacuated, removing roughly 500cc of blood. Pressure dressing
was applied. Patient arrived to the CCU intubated and sedated
and a few continued bouts of intermittent low blood pressures.

Past Medical History:

[**2139-11-5**] ECHO: Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The
left ventricular cavity size is normal. The overall LV ejection
fraction appears moderately-to-severely depressed secondary to
extensive apical akinesis , and severe hypokinesis of the
anterior septum. There is no ventricular septal defect. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. There is no pericardial effusion.
Overall impression is severe anteroseptal hypokinesis/akinesis,
LVEF = 30%.

is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. LV systolic function appears
moderately-to-severely depressed (ejection fraction 30 percent)
secondary to akinesis of the anterior septum and anterior free
wall; there is extensive apical akinesis with focal dyskinesi..
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
The aortic arch is moderately dilated. There are focal
calcifications in the aortic arch. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. The estimated pulmonary artery
systolic pressure is normal. There is no pericardial effusion.
