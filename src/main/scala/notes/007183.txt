History of Present Illness:
This is an 89 year man with with a history of a subdural
hematoma who underwent a craniotomy with evacuation of bilateral
SDH with drains on [**2103-9-17**] at [**Hospital **] Hospital.
Originally Mr. [**Known lastname 46825**] [**Last Name (Titles) 50921**] and fell on [**2103-7-23**] while
gardening. This seemed to be related to his chronic right foot
drop.  There was no LOC. He immediately ambulated. His family
noticed an altered mental status; however, he did not seek
medical attention until [**2103-8-2**] when he was found to have
bilateral SDH's on CT and MR [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **]. He went on vacation for
a week, had increased headaches and returned to OSH for CT/MR of
the head which revealed no significant SDH change, but
evacuation was required and performed on [**9-17**] with placement of
bilateral subdural drains.

Per the outside records, he had postop abdominal pain relieved
in decubitus position. He became confused, diaphoretic,
hypertensive was intubated and sedated in the early am of POD
#1. Head CT showed increase in R subdural collection no change
in the left. Abdominal CT showed 18mm infrarenal abdominal
aortic dissection. He had SBPs in 200s, became bradycardic to
50s despite IV hydralazine. He was then transfered to the [**Hospital1 18**].

ECHO [**2103-9-18**]
The left atrium is elongated. No atrial septal defect is seen by
2D or color Doppler. The estimated right atrial pressure is at
least 15 mmHg. There is moderate symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. There
is probably mild global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 50
%) (the degree of bradycardia and conduction delay associated LV
dysynchrony make an accurate estimate of LVEF more difficult).
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. Tissue
Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling
pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). There is no ventricular septal defect.
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
The diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels
are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened
but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is
no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There
is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.

CXR [**2103-9-18**]
1. Progression of left perihilar and lower hemithorax opacities
may represent aspiration or consolidation.
2. Esophageal catheter with side port in the distal esophagus
and would need to be advanced 7 cm to ensure most proximal side
port within the stomach.

CT head [**2103-9-19**]
1. Marked reduction in size of a right subdural hematoma, with a
drain in
place, and some residual blood products, layering dependently.
2. Bifrontal pneumocephalus, increased on the left, following
removal of this drain.
3. No new focus of hemorrhage.
4. Partial sinus opacification, particular of the sphenoid air
cells, which may relate to intubation and supine positioning.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 46825**] was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] TSICU. On arrival,
intubated, he was sedated with bradycardia to the 30s requiring
x1 atropine with good response. A right axillary arterial line
placed. Neurosurgery evaluated the patient and removed the L JP
drain. The right drain was less functional and was milked with
improved output.

A chest X-rays showed progression of left perihilar and lower
hemithorax opacities may represent aspiration or consolidation.
An ECHO was done showed
EF 50% (the degree of bradycardia and conduction delay
associated LV dysynchrony make an accurate estimate of LVEF more
difficult).

He was on a nitro drip at 1mcg/kg/min with SBP goal < 140. EPS
was consulted.
They agreed with the plan for Hydralazine PRN for BP control
and approved restarting home dose of lisinopril and amlodipine
when tolerating po's.  He was extubated overnight.

Vascular surgery consulted and they felt that this abdominal
pain at OSH was likely not due to his 18mm dissection. There are
no plan for intervention at this point.
He was trasnfered to the Neurosurgery service under the care of
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 739**]. He was getting Dilantin 100mg TID with 1000mg
initial load.  CT head on [**9-19**] showed improvement in right SDH
but the drain was left in place for further evacuation in the am
and this was removed in the pm. Orders for trasnfer to SDU were
written.

CT head in the am of [**2103-9-20**] showed...He had expiratory whezzing
and nebulizer treatment was started. SQH was started for DVT
prophylaxis. Foley cathter was discontinued. PT was consulted.
They recommended rehab.  Now DOD he is set for d/c to rehab and
will f/u accordingly.
