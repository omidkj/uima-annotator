History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Name13 (STitle) 805**] is a 48-year-old F PMhx chronic HCV w Stage I
fibrosis, hypertension, Crohn's disease, rheumatoid arthritis,
and bipolar disorder who presented with with 3 days of
nausea/vomitting, and new onset hematemesis.  Patient reports 10
episodes of about a cup full of vomiting dark, coffee ground
emesis following a binge on 40 ounces of malt liquor and a half
a fifth of Captain [**Doctor Last Name **] original spiced rum.  Patient
reports that she often vomits after drinking (up to 3 times a
week).  She denies taking any cocaine during this time.  Patient
states that she has been having fevers (unmeasured) but no other
localizing symptoms.  She states that she has been drinking
water, but not taking any of her home medications and not eating
due to the vomiting.  She states that she may not have urinated
for the past 2 days and that she did pass a dark, oily stool
yesterday.   Patient denies recent travel, strange foods, or
sick contacts.  On the morning of admission, patient had 1
episode of hematemesis and called 911.

On initial presentation to the ED vital signs were not checked.
Patient was sitting up in bed and able to discuss her history.
Exam was significant for good mentation, nontender abdomen.
Initial labs were significant for Hct 34 (previously 29-36), WBC
18 (N67), Cr 6.4 (normal 1.4-1.7), ALT/AST 33/43 (previously
27/26), lactate 5.8.  CXR demonstrated an elevated right
hemidiaphragm and no consolidation or pleural effusion seen on
the lateral view. She was bolused with IV NS (total 5L) with
blood pressure responsive and resolving to SBP 115-130s with HR
80bpm.  Had clear NG lavage.  Digital rectal exam showed dark
brown guaiac positive stool.  Repeat labs showed lactate 3.8,
Hct 29.  She received 1 dose zosyn and vancoymcin given concern
for infection, and 1 dose IV protonix given concern for GI
bleed. She was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**]

On arrival to the ICU patient had an initial blood pressure of
60s/20s, although this was in the context of her wiggling around
and not sitting still when the cuff was measuring.  I checked
the pressure myself and got 120/50 on a manual cuff.  Patient
did report some recent dizziness with standing, but denies frank
syncope.  Bladder scan was done with 750cc in the bladder.  A
foley was inserted.

OTHER STUDIES
==============
ECG [**2130-3-1**]:
Sinus tachycardia. It is difficult to determine the Q-T interval
secondary to underlying artifact and non-specific ST-T wave
changes. However, the Q-T interval may be slightly prolonged.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2127-4-21**] artifact is not seen
on the current tracing and the Q-T interval may be prolonged.
Clinical correlation is suggested.
.
Chest Radiograph PA and Lateral [**2130-3-1**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. Elevated right hemidiaphragm.
2. Left base not well evaluated on the frontal view, although no
consolidation or pleural effusion seen on the lateral view.
.
EGD [**2130-3-1**]:
Impression: 	Severe esophagitis in the gastroesophageal junction
and lower third of the esophagus
Ulcer in the gastroesophageal junction
No blood was seen throughout the procedure
Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum
Recommendations: 	Continue PPI 40mg [**Hospital1 **].
Restart ranitidine when renal function improves, if possible.
Consider sucralfate slurry 1gram QID.
Alcohol cessation counselling.
Antireflux regimen: Avoid chocolate, peppermint, alcohol,
caffeine, onions, aspirin. Elevate the head of the bed 3 inches.
Go to bed with an empty stomach.
Repeat endoscopy in [**8-27**] weeks to evaluate esophageal ulcer and
esophagitis for healing.
.
Renal U/S [**2130-3-2**]:
IMPRESSION:
No obstructing stones, masses or hydronephrosis.
