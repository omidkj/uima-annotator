Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5790**]
Chief Complaint:
1. Right sided empyema.
2. Retroperitoneal bleed.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2188-11-7**] Right VATS total pulmonary decortication.


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 35028**] is an 80 year-old male who presented to [**Hospital 1562**]
Hospital with right flank pain on [**2188-10-2**], sent home and
represented on [**2188-10-6**] with persistent right flank pain.  CT
scan showed a multiloculated mass in the right retroperitoneum
below the liver, displacing the peritoneal envelope laterally.

[**2188-10-16**] CT scan direct biopsy showed inflammatory cell and grew
a heavy pantoea species which is an Enterobacter-like bacteria.
Resistent to cefazolin and ampicillin.  He was started on
Levaquin. Two pigtails were placed.  The patient had a
thoracentesis for a large right pleural effusion, which drained
50-60 mL of turbid fluid which grew Pantoea. A pigtail was
placed.  On [**2188-10-31**] 2 Flank and 1 pleural drain fell out.  The
patient returned to [**Hospital 1562**]  Hospital.  Repeat imaging studies
showed a right pleural effusion had  reaccumalated with multiple
locules and webs. 50 cc of cloudy fluid was drained and the
pigtail was replaced. 25 cc of bloody, non-purulent fluid
drained was drained from the right flank, and 2 pigtails were
placed.  Cultures revealed no growth in both anerobic and
aerobic.  Gram stain showed neutrophils.

He was seen by cardiology on [**2188-11-1**] for new lower extemity
edema who increased his lasix 40/20.  His coumadin was
restarted.
Labs on transfer: [**2188-11-4**]  WBC 5.7, HCT 31, Hgb 10.3 Plts 191
INR 2.6 PT 26.3  Na+ 129 K 4.8 Chl 88 Co3 34 BUN 0.9 Cre 0.7
Glucose 100  Ca+ 8.1

The patient was transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] for evaluation and
management.

Past Medical History:

[**2188-11-14**] PA and lateral CXR impression:
The two right chest tubes have been removed in the interim. No
apparent
pneumothorax is seen. Right pleural effusion with adjacent
atelectasis has
slightly decreased in the interim with improved aeration of the
right lung
base. The left lung is unchanged. Cardiomediastinal silhouette
and pacemaker leads are unchanged. The feeding tube tip is in
the very proximal stomach, unchanged as well.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 35028**] was transfered from [**Hospital 1562**] Medical Center to
[**Hospital1 18**] on [**2188-11-4**] for management of right empyema and
retroperitoneal bleed. The patient underwent right VATS total
pulmonary decortication by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on [**2188-11-7**] after
being worked up for his empyema, and seen by cardiology given
his cardiac history.

The patient went to the PACU postoperatively and was extubated,
however required reintubation shortly thereafter for
resuscitation for acute blood loss. He was transferred to the
SICU. He was tranfused blood, and remained intubated until
[**2188-11-11**].  He transfered to the floor on [**2188-11-12**].  He initially
failed swallow, however passed a thick nectar and soft solids
diet on [**2188-11-13**].  PT/OT was working with the patient and
recommended rehab on discharge.  On [**2188-11-14**] the patient's right
chest tubes were removed and chest xray did not reveal any
pneumothorax. His right retroperitoneal drain remained intact,
with daily flushing, however minimal output. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] with
general surgery is recommending follow up CT scan in one week
from discharge and follow up to determine when the drain can be
removed. At rehab the drain does not need flushing.

The patient was confused during the night hours and pulled out
his dobhoff, and presumably on his foley, although not
witnessed, and had hematuria [**2188-11-13**] requiring urology
consultation and continuous bladder irrigation. The three way
catheter was discontinued on [**2188-11-17**] 10am and the patient has
voided well since without hematuria.

Geriatrics was consulted for delirium and placed the patient on
nightly trazadone 25 mg, and on Monday [**2188-11-17**] the patient
appears to have improved. Geriatrics recommends reevaluation at
rehab prior to the patient actually going home. He should
continue on trazadone 25 mg po qhs at rehab with fall
precautions.

It is also noted the patient had cardiology management for his
ischemic cardiomyopathy. Last LVEF was 50-55% on [**2188-11-8**]. He has
been optimized on his medications. Regarding anticoagulation for
his PAF, the patient is being discharge without, given his risk
of bleeding, and his retroperitoneal drain. Reinitiation will
need to be explored as an outpatient by his primary medical
doctors. He was even on his fluid balance during his inpatient
stay and off lasix. Given his history of heart failure, and the
fact that he's been on lasix, with new findings of leg edema,
the patient is being reinitiated on lasix 20 mg po daily and KCl
10 meq po daily starting the day of discharge to rehab. He will
need lyte follow up tomorrow or Wednesday. The patient should
have daily weights at rehab to fine tune his diuretic regimine.
The patient should also have his lytes closely followed, as he
is on an ace inhibitor and may not need potassium replacement
with the lasix.

The patient passed a swallow evaluation [**2188-11-13**] for nectar
thick liquids and soft solids, however his intake is poor, and
the Registered Dietician recommended nocturnal tube feedings via
dobhoff. The patient was evaluated by PT who recommended rehab,
which the patient has a bed awaiting him on [**2188-11-17**] at Rehab
Hospital of [**Location (un) **] in the Islands. The patient has been deemed
safe for transfer by attending Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]. The patient and
his wife are aware. All questions from the patient and family
have been answered.
