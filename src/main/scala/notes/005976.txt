Service:  ICU

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:   Mr. [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname **] is an
86-year-old gentleman with a history of coronary artery
disease status post coronary artery bypass graft, congestive
heart failure with an ejection fraction in the 30% range,
atrial fibrillation on Coumadin, chronic renal insufficiency,
hepatitis C, liver cirrhosis, who presented to the Medical
Intensive Care Unit with fever and hypotension on [**2193-6-5**].
The patient was transfused at the [**Hospital6 8862**] approximately two days prior to admission for
chronic anemia of uncertain etiology, according to the
patient's family.  The day following transfusion, the patient
was in his usual state of health.  The morning of admission,
at 1 A.M., the patient began to have rigors and a fever at
home.  The patient's family describes a fever to 38.5 degrees
Celsius in the early morning hours.  The patient denied chest
pain, shortness of breath, cough, dysuria, nausea, vomiting,
diarrhea.  He has chronic abdominal pain.  It was unclear
whether there were any changes in this abdominal pain.
Additionally, the patient did not complain of headache or
neck stiffness.

In the [**Hospital1 69**] Emergency Room,
the patient was afebrile and initially had a blood pressure
in the 110 range, but became progressively hypotensive with a
systolic blood pressure in the 80s, as well as a temperature
spike to 102 degrees Farenheit, and oxygen saturation in the
90s.

On physical examination in the Emergency Room, there was
noted to be right upper quadrant as well as left lower
quadrant tenderness without rebound or guarding.  It was
unclear in discussion with the patient's family whether this
was actually a change for him.  The patient was noted to have
a white count of 17.8, with a left shift and 1 band form.
The chest x-ray, urinalysis and blood cultures were
performed.  Chest x-ray failed to demonstrate infiltrates.
Urinalysis demonstrated evidence of urinary tract infection.
The patient was given ampicillin, levofloxacin and Flagyl.
The patient's daughter, acting as his health care proxy,
refused further workup including CT scan and lumbar puncture
in the Emergency Room.  Additionally, the patient's family
refused central venous access.  Therefore, in the Emergency
Room, the patient was begun on dopamine via peripheral
intravenous lines and was transferred to the Intensive Care
Unit.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Coronary artery disease status post
coronary artery bypass graft in [**5-1**], ejection fraction
depressed in the 30 to 35% range, polymorphic ventricular
tachycardia status post ICD, left ventricular aneurysm,
history of hyperparathyroidism status post parathyroid
resection, chronic renal insufficiency with a creatinine
baseline 1.8 to 1.9 range, anemia for which the patient is
followed at the [**Hospital6 1708**], hepatitis C
with stable liver mass, hypertension, urinary tract
infections, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, hard of hearing.

ALLERGIES:   No known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:   According to the patient's wife
and daughter, [**Name (NI) 8863**] [**Name (NI) 8864**] 12.5 mg by mouth twice a day, lasix
20 mg by mouth three times a week, Zestril 2.5 mg by mouth
once daily, Coumadin 3 mg by mouth once daily, multivitamin
one pill once daily, calcium 250 mg by mouth twice a day,
Trental 400 mg by mouth twice a day, Nexium 20 mg by mouth
once daily, vitamin D.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Retired schoolteacher from [**Country 532**], positive
60 pack year tobacco history, quitting two years ago, denies
alcohol use.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:   At the time of admission, temperature
was 92.0, heart rate 72, blood pressure 107/42 on 5 mcg of
dopamine, respiratory rate 22, oxygen saturation 92 to 93% on
room air.  In general, an elderly male in distress.  The
oropharynx was noted to be dry. The lungs were clear.  The
left radial pulse was decreased. The right radial pulse was
regular.  The cardiac examination revealed a distant cardiac
examination with a normal S1 and S2, a II/VI holosystolic
murmur at the apex.  Present bowel sounds and an abdominal
examination notable for wincing and grimacing with palpation
in the right upper quadrant but otherwise non-rigid abdomen,
nondistended abdomen.  There was no peripheral edema.  The
neck was noted to be supple.  The patient was following
commands of his daughter.  [**Name (NI) **] was alert, moving all four
extremities equally.  He was noted to have bibasilar
crackles, approximately one-quarter of the way up, otherwise
clear to auscultation bilaterally.  Please note that the
patient's blood pressure on the initial examination by
Medicine in the Emergency Room had a blood pressure in the
80s/40s.

DATA:  White blood count at the time of admission was 17.8,
hematocrit 29.8, with a differential on the initial white
count of 94% neutrophils, 1% bands, 2% lymphocytes, 2%
monocytes, 1% atypical cells. A repeat differential on [**2193-6-6**]
at 3:40 A.M. demonstrated 80% neutrophils, 15% bands, 1%
lymphocytes, 3% monocytes, as well as 1% metas.  A platelet
count at admission was 185, with a PT of 20.3 and an INR of
2.9, a PTT of 41.8.  Urine at the time of admission was
negative for urinary tract infection.  A Chem 7 at the time
of admission revealed a sodium of 137, potassium 4.6,
chloride 103, bicarbonate 19, BUN 57, creatinine 2.2, glucose
84.  ALT was 48, AST 59, LDH 271, CK 27 and flat for this
admission.  Alkaline phosphatase was 274, amylase 131, total
bilirubin 1.1, lipase 24, troponin less than 0.3 on multiple
measures.  Calcium was 8.2, phos 2.5, magnesium 1.6.  Albumin
was 3.0.  A free calcium 67 was 1.12.  Blood cultures from
[**2193-6-11**] demonstrate no growth to date. Blood cultures from
[**2193-6-5**] demonstrate staphylococcus aureus coag-positive,
sensitive to oxacillin in four out of four bottles.  A sputum
from [**2193-6-6**] was felt to be contaminated.  Urine culture
demonstrated less than 10,000 organisms.

RADIOLOGIC DATA:  Chest x-ray from [**2193-6-5**] demonstrated no
defined consolidation.  A PA and lateral from the same date
demonstrated interval increase in size of bilateral pleural
effusions, incidental note made of degenerative change in the
right shoulder.  A repeat chest x-ray of [**2193-6-6**] demonstrated
findings consistent with asymmetric pulmonary edema.  A CT
scan performed on [**2193-6-6**] of the abdomen and pelvis
demonstrated the following:  Bilateral pleural effusions,
right greater than left, with a small right subpulmonic
component, bibasilar partial collapse, consolidation, right
greater than left, low attenuation of focus in the superior
aspect of the right lobe of the liver.  Evaluation is limited
by lack of intravenous contrast, small amounts of free fluid
within the pelvis.  There is fluid and stranding within the
right pericolic gutter.  No abdominal pathology is
identified. A right upper quadrant ultrasound performed
[**2193-6-6**] demonstrates cholelithiasis without evidence for acute
cholecystitis, as well as question of liver echotexture and
solitary well-defined mass within the right hepatic lobe,
consistent with the patient's history of cirrhosis and known
hepatic mass.  Electrocardiogram from [**2193-6-5**] was read as
follows:  Atrial fibrillation, intraventricular conduction
defect, inferior infarct age undetermined.

CARDIOLOGY DATA:  Echocardiogram performed on [**2193-6-6**]
demonstrated the following:  The left atrium is mildly
dilated.  Left ventricular cavity is mildly dilated.  Overall
left ventricular systolic function difficult to assess, but
probably moderately depressed.  Posterolateral and apical
hypokinesis was present.  The aortic valve leaflets are
mildly thickened.  Mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened.  Moderate 2+ mitral regurgitation is seen.  Due to
shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation might be
significantly underestimated.  Moderate 2+ tricuspid
regurgitation is seen.  There is moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
