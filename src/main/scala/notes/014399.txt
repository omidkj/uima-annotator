CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Infected axillofemoral bypass graft.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This 63 year old white female
who presented with infected right axillofemoral graft, who is
status post left aortofemoral bypass using left superficial
femoral vein graft via the retroperitoneal approach. The
patient originally had an aorto-[**Hospital1 **]-femoral bypass with Dacron
in [**2141-3-16**]. Since that time she has had multiple
complications with her original aorto-[**Hospital1 **]-femoral bypass which
has since been excised secondary to infection and since that
time has had multiple bypass procedures to restore flow to
the lower extremities. The patient is admitted post surgery
to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit for continued
postoperative care.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Is significant for coronary artery
disease with an angioplasty, type 2 diabetes on oral agents,
hypertension, hypercholesterolemia.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Multiple bypass vascular procedures,
left retroperitoneal to left femoral with nonreversed left
superficial vein graft on [**2147-2-24**].  A thrombectomy of the
right axillo-femoral-femoral graft on [**11-19**] and excision of
infected aorto-[**Hospital1 **]-femoral graft in [**9-19**], a right
axillofemoral to left profunda bypass with nonreversed
saphenous vein in [**2146-9-16**].  A right axillo to
profunda Dacron bypass with ligation of the common femoral
artery in [**2146-9-16**]. An aorto-[**Hospital1 **]-femoral bypass in
[**2141-3-16**].

ALLERGIES:  Include codeine and Percocet.

ADMITTING PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  As the patient is intubated,
sedated, vital signs 98.1, 93/50, 36, 18, 99 percent O2
saturations. PAP is 28/16. CVP is 10. Cardiac output 7.3. SVR
832. Blood gases on assist control are 7.30, 43, 114, 22, -4.
Cardiovascular examination: Regular rate and rhythm with a
right internal jugular Cortis with Swan left brachial
arterial line. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat examination: Pupils are 3
to 2 bilaterally. Chest is with a well healed transverse
right upper chest incision. The abdomen has a well healed
midline laparotomy incision, left flank incision. Dressings
are clean, dry and intact. Palpable femoral-femoral graft
(suprapubic). Patient's abdomen is nontender, obese.
Extremities: The left medial thigh incision is clean, dry and
intact with a palpable graft. The right groin graft is
palpable with a fluctuant mass.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient underwent on [**2147-2-24**] a left
aortofemoral bypass using left superficial femoral vein for
an infected axillofemoral bypass. The patient tolerated the
procedure and was transferred to the Surgical Intensive Care
Unit for continued monitoring and care. Postoperative day one
there were no overnight events. The patient was alert and
followed commands. The pulse examinations were monophasic
dorsalis pedis and posterior tibialis bilaterally. The
incisions were clean, dry and intact. The abdominal
examination was unremarkable with bowel sounds. Postoperative
hematocrit was 30.0, BUN was 16, creatinine 0.7, lactate on
admission 6.9, on postoperative day 1 A.M. lactose was 5.1.
Her mixed venous O2 was 71 percent. Plans were wean Levophed,
continue assist control ventilation, continue n.p.o.,
maintain the urinary output of 40 cc per hour and remain in
the Surgical Intensive Care Unit. Postoperative day two the
patient desaturated with hypotensive episodes. She required
fluid and one unit of packed red blood cells. Blood cultures
and cortisol tests were ordered. She remained on Levophed and
propofol. Her maximum temperature was 100.4. Blood gases
7.44, 33, 78, 23, 0, on assist control 60 percent, 500
volume, 23 and 5. Her hematocrit remained stable. She
required repletion of her potassium and magnesium. Levophed
was weaned. Patient continued with diuresis. She continued on
Vancomycin, Flagyl and levofloxacin. She remained in the
Surgical Intensive Care Unit. Postoperative day three the
patient began to diurese. Her hematocrit after a total of
four units of packed red blood cells over the last 48 hours
32.6. BUN and creatinine remained stable. Examination:
Incisions were clean, dry and intact. Her pedal pulses were
biphasic and singles bilaterally. Lopressor was increased for
rate control. Plans were to wean to SIMV, remain n.p.o.
fluids KVO and she remained in the Surgical Intensive Care
Unit. Postoperative day number 4 the patient had no overnight
events, continued to diurese off intravenous Lasix drip,
temperature defervesced to 99.5. Her lactate was 1.0. Gases
on SIMV were 7.42, 38, 107, 25 and 0. Her hematocrit remained
stable at 33. BUN and creatinine were stable. Examination
remained unchanged. The incisions were clean, dry and intact
without erythema or hematoma. Antibiotics were continued and
the patient remained in the Surgical Intensive Care Unit.

On postoperative day four total parenteral nutrition was
instituted for nutritional support. Antibiotics were
continued. She remained intubated. Diuresis was continued.
Sputum cultures were sent. She remained in the Intensive Care
Unit. On [**2147-3-1**], postoperative day five her Swan-Ganz
catheter was converted to a triple lumen catheter without
difficulty. On postoperative day six there were no other
overnight events except for the change in the Swan catheter.
She continued to be diuresed on intravenous Lasix. Her x-ray
showed decreased size in the pleural effusion. She continued
on her Vancomycin. She remained intubated with nasogastric
tube in place. She remained in the Surgical Intensive Care
Unit. Postoperative day number seven the patient's maximum
temperature was 99.8. She continued on antibiotics. An
attempt would be made to wean to extubate. She continued on
Lopressor for blood pressure and rate control. Subcutaneous
heparin was continued. Insulin was increased for glycemic
control. She remained in the Intensive Care Unit.

On postoperative day eight, overnight events, patient was
extubated and she continued diuresis. She was 98 percent on
face mask with nasal cannula. Her lactate was 1.6, hematocrit
34.5, BUN and creatinine remained stable at 24 and 0.6. Her
pulse examination showed palpable pulses bilaterally. The
incisions were clean, dry and intact. Patient's abdominal
examination was unremarkable. She had not passed flatus.
Nasogastric tube was removed and patient was begun on clears.
Total parenteral nutrition was continued. Arterial line was
changed over a wire. Patient was transferred to the Vascular
Intensive Care Unit for continued monitoring and care on
postoperative day eight. Postoperative day nine she was
afebrile with a maximum temperature of 98.7. She was off the
Lasix drip and she required increase in her Lasix to 40
t.i.d. Insulin drip was continued for glycemic control.
Resident was called to see the patient at 1815. She
complained and noted that the left brachial line abruptly
lost tracing. The line was flushed without difficulty but
there is no tracing. The arterial line was removed and at
1850 the resident returned to the bedside because of the
patient complaining of left hand cool and numb. Evaluation
noted mild numbness on the anterior hand specific to nerve
distribution, capillary refill 3 to 4 seconds and the hand
was cool compared to the right hand with no cyanosis. Doppler
examination showed weak monophasic radial. No distal ulnar,
weak monophasic proximal ulnar. Weak monophasic brachial
distal to the arterial line site, a triphasic brachial
proximal to the arterial line site, palpable axillary graft.

The patient was heparinized with bolus and infusion. At 2200
the hand was slightly warmer, was non-cyanotic. The capillary
refill was 3 seconds. The right radial and ulnar pulses were
monophasic and the brachial was triphasic
