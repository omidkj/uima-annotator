Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1**]
Chief Complaint:
77M s/p sigmoid colectomy for recurrent diverticulitis presented
10 days post operatively with shortness of breath, abdominal
distention, bloating, diarrhea, and abdominal pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2125-6-16**] Total abdominal colectomy, end-ileostomy.


History of Present Illness:
77 year old male with multiple medical problems admitted with
abdominal pain, leukocytosis and fever s/p sigmoid resection [**5-25**]
for recurrent diverticulitis. His postoperative course was
complicated by NSTEMI post-operatively, as well as concern
regarding possible anastamotic leak. He had a CT scan of the
abdomen and pelvis on [**5-28**] without evidence of leak. He was
treated with Zosyn from [**Date range (1) 57306**] empirically. He was discharged
on [**6-2**] to home off of antibiotics.

The patient recently [**Month/Year (2) 1834**] the above operation, he presented
to [**Hospital 77429**] medical center complaining of fairly acute onset of
abdominal pain after having a bowel movement on [**6-4**]. In the ER,
he was noted to be afebrile with abdominal pain and tenderness.
At that time, he was complaining of frequent loose liquid stools
and progressive abdominal distension. He had a WBC of 18.5, 79 %
polys, 12 % bands with minor derangements in his chemistries and
liver function testing, normal amylase and lipase. He was sent
to radiology to have a CT scan and apparently rigored in the
radiology department at [**Hospital3 **] so he was given empiric
antibiotics with vancomycin, Zosyn and flagyl.

Arrangements were made for transfer to [**Hospital1 **] and he was transferred
here for ongoing care.

   CLOSTRIDIUM DIFFICILE TOXIN ASSAY (Final [**2125-6-5**]):
      REPORTED BY PHONE TO [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 24448**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 24449**] ON [**2125-6-5**] AT NOON.
      CLOSTRIDIUM DIFFICILE.
         FECES POSITIVE FOR C. DIFFICILE TOXIN BY EIA.
           (Reference Range-Negative).
         A positive result in a recently treated patient is of
uncertain
         significance unless the patient is currently
symptomatic
.
STUDIES:
[**6-5**]: CT with rectal contrast: no leak, pancolitis
[**6-14**] KUB: distended colon (~9cm), no distension of small bowel
[**6-15**] KUB: No [**Month/Year (2) 65**] change in gaseous distention of colon. Diffuse
distention of small-bowel loops that may reflect adynamic ileus.
.
  Pathology Examination
Procedure date    [**2125-6-16**]
DIAGNOSIS:
Colon and omentum, subtotal colectomy:
1.  Severe pseudomembranous colitis with marked colonic
dilation; see note.
2.  Proximal ileal and distal colonic margins, uninvolved.
3.  Appendix with fibrous obliteration.
4.  One unremarkable lymph node.
5.  Previous colocolonic anastomosis intact.
Note:  The findings are consistent with C. difficile colitis in
the appropriate clinical setting.
Clinical:  Colitis.


Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the surgical floor for continued
monitoring.  He was started empirically on cipro/flagyl, started
on IVF and a foley catheter was placed.  CT scan on admission
showed pan colitis associated with an elevated white count.

[**6-5**] - started on sips, continued on PO vancomycin and flagyl,
cipro discontinued.  GI consult obtained, agreed with antibiotic
plan.

[**6-6**] advanced to clears as the patient looked to be improving

[**6-7**] - WCC increasing, but patient clinically improving.  KUB
showed dilated transverse colon.  Diet changed to NPO

[**6-8**] - PICC line placed, TPN started

[**6-9**] TPN, antibiotics continued
[**6-10**] - sips started, cont TPN, antibiotics
[**6-11**] - [**6-13**] - advanced to clears, gentle diuresis started, cont
TPN, antibiotics
[**6-14**] - flagyl discontinued
[**6-15**] - abdominal pain increasing, KUB showed [**Last Name (un) **] increase in
colonic distention, no flatus/BM x 48 hours
[**6-16**] - increasing pain, no improvement, patient taken to the
operating room for subtotal colectomy, end ileostomy.  Following
the procedure the patient was transferred intubated to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**],
required minimal pressor support for transient hypotensive,
started on zosyn / vanc / flagyl

[**6-17**] - fluid resuscitated for low CVP, pressor support as needed

[**6-18**] - Patient fluid overloaded, in heart failure - cardiology
consulted - recommended lasix drip and diuresis of 1 liter per
day, pressors as needed, transfused one unit RBC for hct of
23.0, TPN resumed after being held for 2 days for fluid overload

[**6-19**] - continued on minimal pressors, lasix drip, TPN,
antibiotics, transfused 2 units RBC

[**6-20**] - [**6-21**] - continued ventilator support, minimal pressors,
lasix drip, TPN, antibiotics, discontinued zosyn, continued on
vanc / flagyl

[**6-22**] - patient extubated without difficulty, vancomycin
discontinued, continued on antibiotics, TPN, lasix drip

[**6-23**] - continued diuresis, TPN, antibiotics, started on clear
liquid diet, discontinued central line, a line

[**6-24**] - started on a regular diet, transferred to the floor,
