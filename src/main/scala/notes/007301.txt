[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 15255**] of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 58995**] is a 76 year old gentleman status post AVR/CABGx3
[**2176-12-31**] by Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) **]. He was discharged home on [**2177-1-6**] on
coumadin for atrial fibrillation. He was also on plavix and
amiodarone. Roughly a day after discharge, Mr, [**Known lastname 58995**] began
to feel progressively tired. He denies any chest pain, syncope
or palpitations however did experience dysnea with laying flat.
On [**2177-1-10**], he noticed that he passed bloody urine. Incidently
he had fallen on his rightside two days prior. He presented to
an outside emergency room where a CT scan of his pelvis and
kidneys was unremarkable. His INR was 6.4 and a chest x-ray
revealed cardiomegally with a left sided pleural effusion. He
was diuresed and claims to have felt better. The urology service
saw him and was planning lithotripsy as an outpatient for
nephrolithiasis given his past history. Mr. [**Known lastname 58995**] was
subsequently transferred back to the [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1675**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]
Medical Center given his hematuria, congestive heart failure,
anemia and supratherapeutic INR.

[**2177-1-13**] - CXR
Status post CABG/AVR. There is cardiomegaly but no evidence for
CHF. There are small bilateral pleural effusions with associated
atelectasis in the left lower lobe. No pneumothorax.

[**2177-1-13**] - EKG
Sinus bradycardia. Left atrial abnormality. Modest non-specific
intraventricular conduction delay. Diffuse ST-T wave
abnormalities with
prolonged QTc interval. Clinical correlation is suggested for
metabolic/drug effect. Since the previous tracing of [**2176-12-31**]
sinus bradycardia rate has increased. No pacer activity is seen
and further ST-T wave changes are present

[**2177-1-14**] ECHO
1. The left atrium is mildly dilated.
2. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left
ventricular
systolic function cannot be reliably assessed.
3. The aortic root is mildly dilated.
4. A prosthetic aortic valve is present.
5. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+)
mitral
regurgitation is seen.
6. There is a moderate sized (1-2 cm) pericardial effusion with
fibrin
deposits on the surface of the heart. Right ventricular
compression is
present, which suggests the presence of some tamponade.
7. Compared with the findings of the prior study (tape reviewed)
of [**2176-12-24**], the pericardial effusion is new.

[**2177-1-15**] CYTOLOGY
Blood and rare reactive mesothelial cells

[**2177-1-15**] ECHO
The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Segmental
wall motion was not fully assessed. Right ventricular chamber
size is normal. There is a small pericardial effusion. There are
no echocardiographic signs of tamponade. Compared with the prior
study (tape reviewed) of [**2177-1-14**], the pericardial effusion is
now much smaller.

[**2177-1-14**] PERICARDIOCENTESIS
Right Heart Catheterization: was performed by percutaneous entry
of the
right femoral vein, using a 6 French pulmonary wedge pressure
catheter,
advanced to the PCW position through a 8 French introducing
sheath.
Cardiac output was measured by the Fick method.
Pericardiocentesis: was performed via the subxyphoid approach,
using an
18 gauge thin-wall needle, a guide wire, and a drainage
catheter.
Right femoral artery was accessed with a 4 French catheter from
arterial
hemodynamic monitoring.


[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 4125**]ospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 58995**] was admitted to the [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1675**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] Medical
Center on [**2177-1-13**] for further management of his hematuria and
congestive heart failure. An echocardiogram was performed which
noted signs of tamponade. Given his elevated INR, fresh frozen
plasma and vitamin K were given for reversal. On [**2177-1-14**], Mr.
[**Known lastname 58995**] was taken to the cardiac catheterization lab where he
underwent pericardiocentesis with drainage of 350cc's of blood
fluid. He was transferred to the cardiac surgical intensive care
unit for monitoring. The urology service was consulted for
hematuria however as Mr. [**Known lastname 58995**] was already under the care
of an outside urologist, he elected to have follow-up with his
outpatient urologist. Hie foley catheter drianage cleared from
pink to yellow. On [**2177-1-16**], his pericardial drain was removed
without issue. A repeat echocardiogram showed a significant
improvement in his pericardial effusion. Anticoagulation was
resumed for his paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. Mr. [**Known lastname **]
was transferred to the cardiac surgical step down unit for
further recovery. Gentle diuresis continued. The
electrophysiology service was consulted for assistance with his
atrial fibrillation. His amiodarone dose was decreased and it
was elected to wait one week prior to resuming his coumadin. On
[**2177-1-17**], Mr. [**Known lastname 58995**] was discharged home. He will follow-up
with Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) **], his cardiologist and his primary care
physician as instructed.
