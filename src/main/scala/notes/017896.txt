History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 28 year old morbidly obese female with a
history of asthma and of DVT/PE presenting with a chief
complaint of chest pain.  She was recently discharged after an
ICU stay.  She was admitted during that stay for this chest
pain. PE and ischemia were ruled out as causes of her chest
pain, however, her hospital course was complicated by an episode
of hypercarbic respiratory failure and an episode of respiratory
alkalemia, both requiring intubation.  She complained of [**2158-7-18**]
chest pain throughout her hospital stay.  A thorough history and
physical exam, EKG, Cardiac Enzymes, Echocardiogaphy (TTE &
TEE), breast discharge cultures, blood cultures, chest x-rays,
CT scan, abdominal ultrasound, and CT failed to discover an
organic etiology of her pain.  A comprehensive review of outside
hospital records from [**Hospital3 **], Caritas [**Hospital3 **],
Caritas [**Hospital3 **], and [**Hospital6 **] indicated that
the she has chronically complained of unexplained chest pain in
the past 6  months.  Psychiatry was involved in her care and
during her stay lithium was discontinued d/t polyuria and
incontinence, risperdal was converted to abilify because of
hyperprolactinemia.  She was d/c'd to Shattock on [**2156-12-16**].
.
At [**Hospital1 **], she intermittently used her BIPAP.  She complained
of generalized sharp chest pain and SOB on [**2156-12-19**], EKG showed
no changes, CXR was unremarkable, and Ddimer was 325.  She
spiked a fever on [**2156-12-19**].  Blood cultures were drawn and she
was placed on vancomycin because of her history of MRSA.  Staph
simulans and enterococcus avium were grown from the PICC line.
She was switched to daptomycin 1100 mg IV daily because the
enterococcus was vancomycin resistant, but she refused the
daptomycin.  Her PICC was removed on [**2156-12-22**].  On [**2156-12-21**], a
maculopapular rash was noted on her left maxilla and she
complained of blurry vision.  Vision was grossly intact at that
time and there were no noted concerning physical findings.  She
refused any topical and oral/IV antibiotics per report.  She
denied any pain with EOM.  She reported "blurriness" in her left
eye.
.
Per report, she did not like her care at [**Hospital1 **] and left AMA
on the day of presentation.  However, in the cab ride home, she
developed chest pain and reported to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED.  Her chest
pain was similar to previous episodes, stretched across her left
and right chest, radiated to her right shoulder, and was
associated with N/V.  She denied diaphoresis.  She reported some
worsening DOE over the last few days.
.
ED vitals: 100.0  HR 97  101/34  92% on 4L  RR 20
CXR was poor quality and repeat was recommended.  Her EKG had
stable abnormalities from previous.

residential facilities, and inpatient psychiatric hospitals.
Remained institutionalized in various settings including years
in intermediate care at [**Hospital6 4331**].  One year ago,
tried it on her own and describes struggling since being outside
of a group home or other institutionalized setting.  She has
spent much of the past year bouncing between medical and
psychiatric institutions, often creating medical complaints
while in psychiatric settings to move to medical units.  Of
