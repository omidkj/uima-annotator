Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5569**]
Chief Complaint:
Ischemic R Foot

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2111-5-11**] endobronchial ultrasound with biopsies

History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 62-year-old male with history of bilateral
avascular hip necrosis, status post bilateral total hip
arthroplasty.  The patient was at his
rehab facility and noted increasing discomfort at his right
lower extremity with diminishing sensation at the foot and some
limitation of motor function.  He was consented, after initial
performance of angiogram demonstrating severe aorta occlusive
disease

# H/o tonsillectomy
# Left total hip replacement [**2-/2110**]


Social History:
Quit smoking and etoh in [**3-11**]. Frankly denies current ethanol
use, but very heavy use in past per records from OSH. History of
160 pack years tobacco ([**2-6**] ppd over 40-45 years). No IVDU.
Currently unemployed, but formerly works as jeweler.

GEN: NAD, resting comfortably
CV: RRR
Lungs: CTAB
ABD: Soft, slight distension, but non-tender. Incision clean,
dry, and intact.  Steri strips in place. Staples removed.
RLE: Wound clean and dry. No edema.

Pertinent Results:
ECHO [**2111-4-14**]: IMPRESSION: Normal global and regional
biventricular systolic function. Moderate pulmonary
hypertension. Small pericardial effusion.

CT [**2111-4-19**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. Findings described above, likely represent resolving small
bowel
obstruction.
2. Patent aortobifemoral graft with adjacent surgical stranding
and fluid.
Although this may be post-surgical in nature, infection should
be considered
in the correct clinical setting.
3. Stable moderate pericardial effusion.
4. New bilateral moderate pleural effusions with adjacent
compressive
atelectasis, less likely underlying infectious process.
5. Mesenteric edema which may be post-surgical in nature.
6. Focal opacities in the right lateral lower lobe and lingula
may represent
atelectasis vs infection, however malignancy is not necessarily
excluded.

KUB [**2111-4-22**]:
Progression of duodenal and proximal jejunal small bowel
distention worrisome for evolving proximal small-bowel
obstruction.

CTA chest [**2111-4-10**]:
IMPRESSION:

1. Bilateral pulmonary emboli without evidence of right heart
strain.

2. Patchy peripheral opacities in the right middle and lower
lobes,
suspicious for infection. Lymphangitic spread of disease may
also have this
appearance.

3. Marked interval increase in size of pulmonary nodules and
bilateral hilar
and mediastinal lymphadenopathy with interval development or
right pleural and
pericardial effusions.

Given this constellation of findings is highly concerning for
malignancy;
lymphoma and metastases should be considered, although the
differential
includes sarcoidosis, or cryptogenic organizing pneumonitis.
Recommend
correlation with bronchoscopic biopsy.

[**2111-4-27**] Abd XR:
IMPRESSION:
1. Significantly decreased distention of previously noted
dilated loop of
small bowel suggesting resolution of partial small bowel
obstruction or ileus.
2. The nasoenteric tube is seen in appropriate position with the
tip within
the distal stomach and the sidehole past the gastroesophageal
junction.

[**2111-4-28**] Liver USG:
IMPRESSION:
1. Dilated proximal CBD up to 9-mm with mildly prominent right
hepatic duct,
new since the last CT study dated [**2111-4-19**]. While no
cholelithiasis or
proximal choledocholithiasis is directly observed, obstruction
at the distal
CBD cannot be excluded. If clinical concern remains high,
recommend MRCP for
further evaluation.

2. Slightly echogenic liver compatible with known fatty liver.
No focal
hepatic lesions. No ascites.

[**2111-4-30**] CT abd:
High-grade small-bowel obstruction with transition point in the
left mid
abdomen given the swirling appearance of the vessels/bowel loops
is concerning for internal hernia or volvulus. No evidence of
free air.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the vascular service on [**2111-3-28**] for
an ischemic R foot. He underwent aortbifem on [**2111-3-29**]. The
patient tolerated the procedure well. Please see operative
report for more details. Post-operatively, patient was doing
well. Diet was advance and pain was controlled. The right foot
was monitored [**Doctor Last Name **] closely for signs of improvement. After
several it became very clear, that the right foot was not going
to recover. Arterial non-invasives were performed that showed
inadequate blood flow in the R foot. Furthermore, the patient's
WBC continued to rise, reaching a peak of 31. It was decided
that the patient's R foot would not survive and that R BKA was
the best solution. The patient agreed and he was consented after
all the risks and benefits were discussed. The patient underwent
R BKA on [**2111-4-6**], which again went well without complication.
(Please see operative note.)
Postoperatively, the patient's heart rate became an issue. Prior
to the BKA, he maintained a HR in the low 100s with occasional
bursts into the 120s. He was titrated up on po lopressor, which
was helpful in maintaining his heartrate. However, on POD2 after
the BKA, patient became hypotensive with SBP in the 80-90s. He
was otherwise feeling fine. The lopressor was decreased to a
very small dose. However, the heartrate continued to have
bursts, now with episodes into the 200s, and the patient began
to fell lightheaded. As such, cardiology was consulted and they
recommended getting an ECHO to rule out heart issues. This
showed normal heart function. However, patient's oxygen
requirement had increased, although he denied any shortness of
breath. A CT chest was performed that showed extensive bilateral
PEs, so patient was started on a heparin drip which was titrated
to a goal PTT 60-80. The patient was transitioned to coumadin
with a goal INR of [**2-5**]. However, the patient became
supratherapeutic initially, and coumadin was held, and then the
INR dropped to subtherapeutic levels, likely due to improved
nutrition. Heparin drip was restarted. The patient was weaned
off the lopressor as heartrate improved due to treatment of PEs.
The patient's Chest CT scan also showed enlarging pulmonary
nodules with mediastinal/hilar lymphadenopathy. Thoracic surgery
was consulted and recommended EBUS, which is to be performed as
an outpatient.
The patient's appetite was quite limited after his operations.
He had distension in his belly initially that improved as he
passed more flatus and had bowel movements. He was given
supplements to support his nutrition, and he slowly was able to
take more food. However, several days after the R BKA, patient
began to have more distension in his abdomen with worsening
pain. A CT scan was performed that showed evolving pSBO. NGT was
placed and patient was started on TPN. The NGT ultimately
removed on [**2111-4-21**], and patient's diet was slowly re-advanced.
Repeat CT scan showed improvement in the SBO, but KUB showed
persistent dilated loop of small bowel. However, patient felt
better clinically. His NGT was removed on [**2111-4-24**] and he was
advanced to sips & clears. On the following day , he became
nauseous and had multiple bouts of vomiting. An NGT was placed
back in and he was   kept NPO for the next few days. A general
surgery consultation was sought in view of this persistent
ileus. An Abdomina XR was done that showed dilated bowel loops.
A liver UWSG was done the following day sinc
