Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Erythromycin Base

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3705**]
Chief Complaint:
Fall, SAH/SDH

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
The patient is a [**Age over 90 **]yo female with history of hypertension and
arthritis who was recently admitted on [**4-16**] after a fall felt to
be mechanical in nature. The patient had been recently admitted
to medicine on [**4-10**] after a fall and diagnosis of SDH in the
left temporal region and a left occipital subarachnoid
hemorrhage.  These were conservatively managed, and was
discharged from the medicine service to home with services due
to her daughter's wish to avoid rehab.
.
Yesterday, she was being transferred from the commode back to
her leather chair when she became weak. The daughter could not
support her weight and she slipped to the floor. Her head
brushed the leather couch but there was no significant impact.
There was no syncope, chest pain, shortness of breath.  She
presented to the ED where a CT was done showing essentially
stable sizes of her SDH and SAH without neurologic deficit. She
was admitted to the neuro ICU overnight and received q1hr neuro
checks.  This morning, she was felt to be stable from a
neurologic perpective and was transferred to medicine.
.
She was seen in the room with her two daughters with whom she
resides at home.  She has had a waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] mental status-
yesterday she had slurring of speech and confusion, though she
is answering questions appropriately now.  Her daughters are
upset at the realization that they cannot care for her at home,
and very reluctantly agree that rehab is appropriate.
.
On review of systems, she complains of bilateral knee pain which
has been ongoing for many years.  She denies headache, shortness
of breath, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea.

IMAGING

CT HEAD NON-CON [**2156-4-16**]:
The subdural hemorrhage layering along the entire left cerebral
convexity is similar in size and appearance compared to prior
with a posterior hyperdense component and a fluid-fluid layer
with relatively higher density material layering posteriorly.
There is 6-mm rightward shift of normally midline structures,
which is unchanged. The basal cisterns appear patent. Left
temporal subarachnoid hemorrhage appears similar compared to
most recent prior exam and decreased compared to [**2156-4-10**]. Right
frontal and midline posterior falcine meningiomas are again
noted. There is no evidence for new hemorrhage. Right frontal
scalp soft tissue swelling appears similar compared to most
recent prior exam. The visualized portions of the paranasal
sinuses
and mastoid air cells appear well aerated. There are stable
meningiomas along the flax and right frontal lobe. IMPRESSION:
Stable left subdural hematoma and left temporal subarachnoid
hemorrhage.

LEFT HIP, PLAIN FILMS: [**2156-4-17**]:
An AP view of the pelvis and two additional views of the right
hip are submitted. Positioning for the cross-table lateral view
is suboptimal. However, on the other submitted images, bones are
markedly osteopenic. There are degenerative changes of both hips
with no evidence of a displaced fracture or dislocation. If a
hip fracture, however, remains of clinical concern,
further imaging with MRI could be undertaken.

RIGHT KNEE XRAY ON [**2156-4-18**];
IMPRESSION:

1. Severe tricompartmental osteoarthritic changes with large
loose body or
Preliminary Reportdetached osteophyte in the right suprapatellar
joint.

2. No definite acute fracture or dislocation. If there is
continued clinical
Preliminary Report concern for acute radiographically occult
fracture, consider correlation with  MRI.



Brief Hospital Course:
This is a [**Age over 90 **]yoF with a history of recent traumatic SDH/SAH here
s/p repeat fall with stable head bleeds per CT-scan.

ACTIVE PROBLEMS:
1. RECURRENT FALLS:  This fall appeared mechanical, she was
being transferred from the commode to a chair when she felt weak
and slid to the floor.  No major trauma.  Her daughter [**Name (NI) 4134**]
activated EMS.  She realized that she could not care for her
aging mother at her current weakened state just a few days since
her last discharge.  There was no change in the size or shift
from the SAH/SDH found during the last hospitalization on repeat
CT.  She was admitted to the neuro SICU on the night of
admission for neuro checks, and then was transferred to medicine
for further management. She worked with PT, and decision was
made with family to pursue short term rehab. She is also has
difficulty with ambulation due to severe osteoarthritis in her
knees leading to pain.

2. SUBDURAL/SUBARACHNOID HEMORRHAGE:  Appear radiographically
similar on CT.  Will finish 2 more days of seizure prophylaxis
with dilantin since dilatin level was low and keep on Keppra
until she sees neurosurgery on [**5-11**] or for max of 30 days.
Will f/u with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in 3 weeks with a repeat head CT. No
neurologic deficits on exam

3. ACUTE DELIRIUM: She had a waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] level of
attention, which the daughters felt was stable from her last
hospitalization.  She could be easily re-directed. She was
conversing this morning and oriented to place and person.

4. OSTEOARTHRITIS:  She had severe pain of the right knee from
arthritis which limited PT.  Plain films revealed severe
arthritic changes with large loose body or
detached osteophyte in the right suprapatellar joint, but no
fracture were noted. If there is continued clinical concern for
acute radiographically occult fracture, consider correlation
with MRI. She was started on Tylenol 1000mg Q 8hours and
tramadol Q 6 hours with good effect for her pain. Would con
