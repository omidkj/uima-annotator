History of Present Illness:
This is a 68 year old gentleman with
known aortic insufficiency and bicuspid aortic valve who has
been followed by serial echocardiograms. He has had dyspnea on
exertion for quite sometime however it has worsened recently
over the last six months. He also admits to palpitations, [**3-2**]
pillow orthopnea, occasional dizziness and worsening fatigue.
His last echocardiogram in [**2128-11-28**] showed 3+ aortic
insufficiency. A cardiac catheterization this spring revealed
normal coronaries with 2-3+ aortic insufficiency. He now has
been referred for cardiac surgical evaluation.

Findings
LEFT ATRIUM: Marked LA enlargement. Elongated LA. No spontaneous
echo contrast in the body of the [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] LAA. Good (>20 cm/s) LAA
ejection velocity.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Normal interatrial septum. No
ASD by 2D or color Doppler. Prominent Eustachian valve (normal
variant).

LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thickness. Normal LV cavity size.
Overall normal LVEF (>55%).

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size. Normal RV systolic
function.

AORTA: Normal aortic diameter at the sinus level. Mildly dilated
ascending aorta. Normal aortic arch diameter. Mildly dilated
descending aorta. Focal calcifications in descending aorta.

AORTIC VALVE: Bicuspid aortic valve. Minimal AS. Moderate to
severe (3+) AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Normal mitral valve leaflets. Mild (1+) MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets with trivial
TR.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Pulmonic valve not well seen.
Physiologic (normal) PR.

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify I was present in compliance with HCFA
regulations. The patient was under general anesthesia throughout
the procedure. No TEE related complications. The patient appears
to be in sinus rhythm. Results were personally reviewed with the
MD caring for the patient.
Conclusions
PREBYPASS
The left atrium is markedly dilated. The left atrium is
elongated. No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body of
the left atrium or left atrial appendage.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Right ventricular chamber size is normal with normal free wall
contractility.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The descending thoracic
aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve is bicuspid. There is no aortic valve stenosis.
Moderate to severe (3+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. Mild (1+)
mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.

Post_Bypass:
Intact thoracic aorta.
Normal RV systolic function. Overall LV systolic function is
55%.
The aortic bioprosthesis is in situ well placed, stable with a
residual mean gradient of 20mm of Hg with a cardiac output of
7.0L/min.

Minimal MR.

Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in person of the results at the time of
the study.
  I certify that I was present for this procedure in compliance
with HCFA regulations.
