History of Present Illness:
74 year old female with h/o restrictive lung disease due to
severe kyphosis (on 3L home O2 NC), chronic osteomyelitis, and A
fib s/p pacer who presents from rehab with worsening SOB.  Ms.
[**Known lastname **] was recently d/c'd from [**Hospital1 18**] one day PTA at which time
she was treated for pneumonia with Levofloxacin for a LLL
pneumonia.  In addition, she was seen by the pulmonary service
who concluded that part of her dyspnea was [**1-3**] extremely weak
respiratory muscles.  At pulmonary's recommendation, she was
started on BiPAP for rest overnight.  Her hospitalization was
also complicated by delerium which resolved prior to discharge.
She was sent to rehab on discharge.
.
On the day of admission at rehab, she noted the onset of SOB and
fatigue.  She reports cough without sputum, but denies F/C, or
chest pain.  She also complained of diffuse back and left side
pain.  Per daughter's report, her O2 sat was in the 70's and SBP
in 60's, so she was sent to the ER for further evaluation.
.
In the ER, vitals were T = 100.2, HR = 115, BP = 68/37, RR = 31,
and O2 sat = 84% RA --> 100% NRB.  CXR showed persistent LLL
opacity.  WBC count was 16 and lactate 3.1.  Sepsis protocol
initiated and right IJ placed.  She was given total 4 L NS for
hypotension.  Levophed was started for persistently low BP
despite IVF.  She was transferred to the MICU for further
evaluation and management.

Brief Hospital Course:
1) Hypoxic Resp Failure likely [**1-3**] to sepsis/LLL pneumonia
initially and then later a iatrogenic PTX. Pt became tachypneic
c O2 sats in high 80s and required intubation. On the ventilator
maintained on AC for one week c multiple attempts made to
transition to lower tidal volumes and RR to allow increased CO2
to 40 to help reverse an existing respiratory alkalosis. Pt then
transitioned to PS, which she tolerated c several episodes of
tachypnea as well as [**Last Name (un) 6055**]-[**Doctor Last Name **] type breathing attributed to
CNS process. While on AC, pt's respiratory failure also
exacerbated by iatrogenic ptx induced during attempted placement
of a L IJ line by interventional pulmonology. This required
placement of a ptx drain to replace. However, the ptx drain
failed to correct the ptx and therefore a chest tube was placed.
The chest tube lead to the development of a significant amount
of subcutaneous air and had to be repositioned After
repositioning it continued to be unable to correct the ptx and
therefore it was replaced. Persistence of the ptx motivated a CT
to be ordered to determine if the pt had a restrictive process
that was limiting the ability of her lung to re-expand. CT
showed loculated ptx. Pt's continued ventilator reliance
discussed with family, and they elected for trial of extubation
despite poor prognosis. Following extubation pt expired several
hours later on [**2103-7-25**].

2. Sepsis: Pt hypotensive throughout stay. Initially, presumed
[**1-3**] pna that was inadequately treated c Levaquin on [**Hospital Ward Name 516**]
1 day prior to admission. However, pt afebrile, WBC trending
down, and LLL opacity appears slightly improved on CXR. HypoT
improved c MAPs largely >65 and sBPs>100 on only vasopressin and
fluid boluses. Source of sepsis still unknown. PNA most likely
given pt treated for this PTA. Alternative source also being
considered such as osteomyelitis (although being covered
chronically c rifampin and doxy), pacemaker, or abscess.
However, pt never hemodynamically stable enough to allow for
extensive imaging work-up. Pt's IJ from the ER was resited to
ensure it was not the source. This line became dislodged and a L
SCV was placed with IR guidance. Cultures of urine, stool, blood
and from BAL revealed no obvious source. Pt initially treated
with ceftriaxone/vancomycin and later switched to
meropenem/vacno to allow for incd pseudomonal and ESBL coverage
given pt worsened in hospital x 2 weeks. Pt received a full 14
day course of vanc and 10d course of meropenem. She was covered
for possible osteomyelitis with doxycycline and rifampin. A BAL
was perofmed.


3. Hypotension: Presumed [**1-3**] sepsis although pt's extremities
cool and clammy. Initially required multiple fluid boluses and
levophed and vasopressin to maintain MAPs>65. Unlikely
cardiogenic given normal EF and good MvO2. Partially [**1-3**] pt's
low baseline BP of 90/50s. Pt's BP improved c MAP>65 able to
wean off levophed and just give standing boluses. CVPs in teens.
Pt coninuted to third space a significant amount of fluid and
weeped serous fluid from her skin. Despite this pt continue to
be given bolues to maintain her MAPs, b/c merely increasing
pressors did not benefit her s sufficient IV volume. She was
temporarily given neosynephrine but this was also weaned when
her MAPs remained elevated s it. Multiple times her pressors
were weaned only to be restarted for persistent hypotension.

4. [**Name (NI) 27812**] Pt tachyc to 120s intermitently. Likely [**1-3**] pt
discomfort as weaning down sedation for vent weaning. Afib
better controlled on digoxin maintenance dose. Tachycardia
resolved with increased sedation.

5. Anemia- baseline Hct in mid-30's, over past 3 days steadily
dropped from 38 (after 2U for low Hct of 25) to 39.8. Possible
GI bleed but stools Guiac negative. Alternatively, Hct drop may
have partially been a result of hemodilution as pt has received
large amount of IVF. This is less likely given that all IVF have
been third spaced. Hct drop may also be [**1-3**] iatrogenic puncture
of carotid during L SCV placement two days ago. Bilirubin
elevated suggesting hemolysis but primarily direct
hyperbilirubinemia. Difficult to interpret other hemolysis labs
in setting of transfusions. Heme onc consulted and unable to
determine etiology of anemia and thrombocytopenia. Pt had to
receive another 2U of blood and FFP on [**2103-7-16**].

6. Thrombocytopenia- Platelets increased to 180s, up from 30s.
