Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1973**]
Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Endotracheal Intubation


History of Present Illness:
68 yo M with a past medical history of CLL, COPD, HTN presents
with dyspnea over the last 4 months. Patient was having workup
done as an outpatient over last several months, which has
included serial CT Chest without contrast for pulmonary nodules,
the most recent of which was on [**3-3**] which demonstrated new
peripheral lung nodules and question of RUL mass which could be
soft tissue scarring or malignancy. Today patient had TTE done
which showed multiple abnormaliries, including right ventricular
dilation and free wall hypokinesis. He was also noted to be
tachycardic during echo. Patient was advised by outpatient
providers to come to ED.

In terms of symptoms, patient reports that symptoms of dyspnea
started 4 months ago, when he noticed feeling more short of
breath while shoveling snow. She had occasionaly productive
cough with white sputum but no [**Month/Year (2) **] hemoptysis. He reported to
the ED that he had CP, but he denies CP to me. In the past, he
could walk without difficutly and now he feels short of breath
traveling less than 500 feet. Today he was with his wife who was
taking a mental health examination, and reportedly rushing more
than usual, and this caused him to have more dyspnea than usual.
He was experiencing this dyspnea while undergoing TTE. Cough is
worse at night, and he has noticed some orthopnea recently, but
denies [**Month/Year (2) **] PND.

In the ED, EKG was consistent with MFAT and demonstrated TWF
inferiorly and anterior Q waves with no comparisons. Troponin
was 0.02. CT Head was negative. CT Chest showed acute on chronic
bilateral PE. Patient was guaiac negative and heparin drip was
started. Oxygen was accidentally disconnected from the patient,
and he desaturated to 77% and was visibily cyanotic. He came up
to the 80s with 6L NC, and improved to 93% with NRB. Patient
becomes dyspnic with movement, but is comfortable while lying in
bed. Patient was additionally given Protonix 40 mg Ivx1,
Lopressor 5mg IVx1, 1.2 L NS, and FS ASA. Code status was
discussed and per report Full. On transver, VS were Afebrile,
101, 138/89, 33, 99-100 NRB.

In the ICU, denies SOB while at rest and feels better than when
he presented to the ED.

15. Hyperlipidemia

Social History:
He is married and lives with his wife in [**Name (NI) 3146**]. She has
significant emotional problems, which requires the patient to

=====================================
IMAGING:

CTA Chest ([**2185-3-10**]) - IMPRESSION:
1. Pulmonary embolism involving the basal segments of the left
lower lobe.
Partially occlusive thrombus in the pulmonary arterial branches
supplying the basal segments of the right lower lobe, possibly
chronic given their eccentric appearance.
2. Severe bullous emphysema with nodule in the right lung apex
for which
short interval followup is advised.
3. Bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy may be related to patient's
known CLL.
4. Cardiomegaly.
5. Left adrenal nodularity, incompletely imaged though grossly
stable from 08 exam. Recommend CT or MRI to further evaluate as
needed.

CTA Chest ([**2185-3-10**]) - IMPRESSION:
1. Interval resolution of left basilar pulmonary emboli and
interval
improvement in eccentric clot at the right base. No new
pulmonary emboli.
2. New bilateral pleural effusions, moderate on the right and
trace on the
left. Small pericardial effusion, increased from the prior exam
and small
perihepatic ascites, also slightly increased from the prior
exam.
3. Severe emphysema with right apical nodule. Again short-term
followup is
recommended as this has progressed from the [**Month (only) **] study.

CT Head ([**2185-3-10**]) - IMPRESSION: No parenchymal edema. MRI is
more sensitive for detection of intracranial mass lesions.

CXR ([**2185-3-11**] - FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph,
the lung volumes have slightly decreased. Newly appeared
retrocardiac opacity with blunting of the costophrenic sinus.
The changes are consequent of the left lower lobe pulmonary
embolism documented on a CT from [**2185-3-10**].
The left upper lobe bulla is unchanged in extent. Unchanged
radiographic
manifestations of extensive pulmonary emphysema.

CXR ([**2185-3-20**]) - FINDINGS: Cardiomediastinal contours are
unchanged. Emphysema is again demonstrated with superimposed
areas of opacity
