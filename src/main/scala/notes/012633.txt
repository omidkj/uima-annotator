Chief Complaint:
neck pain, feeling "awful"


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Placement of triple lumen catheter in right IJ

History of Present Illness:
56 year old woman with DM, HTN, ESRD on HD, recent MVA, who
presents with neck pain and feeling "awful." She was involved in
a MVA two weeks ago when another car struck her car from the
passenger side. She was in the passenger seat, wearing a
seatbelt, did not strike her head but did experience a jerking
motion of her neck. Afterward she began to experience severe
headaches and posterior neck pain. She was seen at [**Company 191**] on [**5-18**]
and diagnosed with whiplash. X-rays were ordered which she did
not have done. She went to [**Hospital 1474**] Hospital yesterday for the
pain and was given dilaudid and ativan and discharged home. She
continued to feel unwell so came to the ED.

In the ED she initially triggered for hypoxia of 82% on RA in
triage, but on recheck was 100% on RA. Other VS were 99.0, 47,
94/35, 16. She was A&Ox3 but slightly lethargic with pain over
her posterior c-spine. EKG with a junctional rhythm (old) and no
ischemic changes. She dropped her SBP to the 80s so a RIJ was
placed and she was given a dose of empiric zosyn and 2L NS. She
did not required pressors. [**Hospital **] notable for HCT 25 (baseline
high 20s-low 30s), stool guiac neg. CXR with mild vascular
congestion but no pneumonia or other acute process. VS prior to
transfer were 98/50 (MAP 63), 46, satting in the high 90s on 4L.


On arrival to the MICU, the patient continues to experience
severe posterior neck pain and headache. Having chest pain in
the center of her chest, GERD-like, feels like she needs to
burp, worse with deep breaths, and then vomited twice (2nd time
dark, guiac positive). Her symptoms resolved with anti-emetics,
and her hypotension and hypoxia resolved so she was transferred
to the floor. On the floor, she continued to be rather lethargic
but a rousable. She continued to complain of pain and anxiety,
requesting dilaudid and ativan, consistent with reports from
prior hospitalizations. She also complained of neck and back
pain. Her vital signs remained stable except for drops in her
pressure to the 80s systolic during hemodialysis.

IMAGING:

ECG	Study Date of [**2185-5-20**]  2:37:52 PM
Probable junctional rhythm. Prolonged Q-T interval. Poor R wave
progression.
Non-specific ST-T wave abnormalities. Compared to the previous
tracing
of [**2185-1-28**], junctional rhythm is present, voltage criteria for
left ventricular
hypertrophy are now absent. The QRS change in lead V4 could be
due to
variability in lead placement.
Rate	PR	QRS	QT/QTc	P	QRS	T
41	0	102	560/526	0	9	21

[**2185-5-20**] PORTABLE SEMI-UPRIGHT AP VIEW OF THE CHEST:  There is
moderate enlargement of
the cardiac silhouette which is stable.  The mediastinal
contours are
unchanged.  The pulmonary vascularity is mildly engorged
suggesting an element
of elevated pulmonary venous pressure.  No consolidation,
pleural effusion or
pneumothorax is identified, though the left costophrenic angle
is excluded
from the field of view.  There are no acute osseous
abnormalities.
IMPRESSION:  Mild pulmonary vascular congestion.

[**2185-5-20**] CTA chest
1.  No evidence of acute pulmonary embolism or thoracic aortic
pathology.
2.  Pulmonary arterial hypertension with moderate cardiomegaly,
and findings
suggesting mild right heart decompensation.
3.  Mild centrilobular emphysema

[**2185-5-20**] CTA Head and Neck
IMPRESSION:
There is no evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage or acute
intracranial
process.  There is mild-to-moderate cerebral atrophy and mild
vertebral and
internal carotid artery vascular calcifications.
The CTA of the head demonstrates moderate calcifications in both
carotid
siphons and tortuous course of both cervical internal carotid
arteries with no
evidence of occlusions or severe stenosis.  No aneurysms are
identified.
Centrilobular emphysema is present.  No cervical fractures are
identified.
Multilevel degenerative changes are visualized, more significant
at C5/C6.
