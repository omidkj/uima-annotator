IMAGING/STUDIES:
.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP):[**2179-3-29**]
IMPRESSION:
1. Increased retrocardiac density is likely from left lower lung
atelectasis; however, in appropriate clinical setting,
concurrent lung infection cannot be ruled out. Aspiration is
also possible differential.
2. Minimal right lower medial lung atelectasis.
.
RUQ U/S: [**2179-3-29**]
IMPRESSION: Heterogenous increased echotexture in the liver as
can be seen
with hepatic steatosis. Advanced conditions of the liver such as

fibrosis/cirrhosis are not excluded. Wall thickening of the
gallbladder with some fluid around it is likely secondary to the
patient's known pancreatitis, given absence of gallbladder
distention and gallstones. Small amount of perihepatic fluid. No
intra- or extra-hepatic biliary dilatation.
.
CHEST PORT. LINE PLACEMENT Study Date of [**2179-3-29**] 4:23 PM
IMPRESSION: Patient has received a new left internal jugular
line which ends at mid SVC. Endotracheal tube ends approximately
4 cm from the carina and is appropriate. Right central line
through the right internal jugular approach ends into the right
atrium. Orogastric tube is seen terminating into the stomach.
Since prior radiograph acquired 12 hours apart, there is no
significant interval changes in the lungs. L
