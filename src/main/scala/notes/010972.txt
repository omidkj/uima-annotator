History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 83312**] is an 82 yo female with MMP including DM with
triopathy, ESRD on HD since [**2167**], CAD s/p MI X2, RCA stent, HTN,
Rectal cancer, noted on excisional biopsy of a polyp in [**2163**],
h/o CVA [**8-7**] while on asa/plavix, now on coumadin; h/o PVD s/p
b/l fem [**Doctor Last Name **] and L fem-tib bypass, CHF(EF of 40%) who presents
with 2 day h/o increasing LE swelling. Ms. [**Known lastname 83312**] notes that
she had dialysis on Fri [**11-1**] which was terminated 30 minutes
early due to L arm pain (? dialysis needle hit ulnar nerve per
daughter). ALthough h/o b/l pedal edema (R chronically>L), she
notes inc swelling after eating can of sardines yesterday. She
reports h/o difficult fluid balance, with recent admit to ICU
with flash pulmonary edema requiring emergency dialysis which
also p/w similar symptoms. She is compliant with 29cc fluid
restriction/day.  Dry weight~80 kg and she notes 3.5 lb weight
gain over past 3 days. c/o pain in R hand which started during
dialysis friday.- very sensitive and swollen. No R
distal/proximal arm pain. She currently denies SOB/CP/leg
pain?abd pain. no n/v/diarrhea/constipation. no dark/tarry
stools or change in stool diameter. She does report occ. BRB on
toilet paper [**2-4**] hemorrhoids. + chronic lightheadedness,
especially after dialysis without recent change. +fatigue -
chronic problem.
In [**Name2 (NI) **], hct down from 38 ([**10-8**])to 28.6, and 29 on repeat. Guiaic
positive with dark brown stool. NGlavage negative.
Hemodynamically stable. No recent falls/trips. EKG without
changes and CXR actually with improvement of CHF). Sating 100%RA
in ED.
Last colonscopy in [**2167**] - 1 polyp removed and 3 others bx -
benign per patient. No recent colonoscopy.

Morning of transfer to floor, Ms. [**Known lastname 83312**] had a sudden episode
of resp distress with sats dropping down to 40%, so a code was
called.  During the code, she had a pulse and blood pressure;
however she was unresponsive and hypoxic with an ABG of
7.08/91/146.
*
In addition, during the code there was a question of poor RUE
movement.  Neurology was called and a CT of the head was
obtained once the pt was stable which was negative.  Once
transferred to the MICU, the patient was moving all extremities
equally.  Neurology felt that the patient's short duration
episode
*
In the ICU the patient remained intubated.  A CXR was notable
for new patchy opacity at the right base, so was started on
levo/flagyl.  She also underwent  HD on [**11-3**], at which time 2
liters were removed and 2 units of RBCs were transfused.  On
[**11-4**], UF by dialysis team of 2.0 L. After approximately 24
hours, at 10:10 on [**11-4**], the patient was extubated without
complications and sent back to the floor.
*
Reapeat CXR was done on morning of [**11-5**]. Currently, the patient
reports feeling relatively well.  She reports that her breathing
is now improved from the time of admission.  She denies CP/SOB,
palpitations, abdominal pain, diarrhea, or constipation. She
notes decreased swelling of LE bilat(R chronically more swollen
than left) and also decrease swelling of LUE, although still
with parasthesias.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P:
82 yo W w/ h/o CVA, ESRD, DMII, CHF, rectal ca admitted w/
increased pedal edema, G+ stool, sent to the MICU after
admission w/ respiratory arrest and is now s/p intubation.  She
is now extubated, doing well, and be sent back to the floor.
*
1) Respiratory failure - On admission, Mrs. [**Known lastname 83312**] was
breathing comfortably with no complaints of SOB. On morning of
admission (as per HPI) she experienced acute SOB-->respiratory
distress. This was thought to be [**2-4**] to flash pulmonary edema
vs. mucus plug vs. PNA. Given h/o noncompliant diet(s/p
sardines) and incomplete dialysis 2 days prior to admit, flash
pulm edema seems most likely diagnosis.  2 L fluid taken off at
emergent HD upon transfer to MICU with symptomatic improvement.
Also started patient on levo/flagyl
