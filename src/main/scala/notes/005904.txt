[**2168-10-26**] - Cardiac Catheterization

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 9671**] is a 89 year old man with known atrial
fibrillation on coumadin who presented to the [**Hospital1 18**] emergency
department after a fall the night of admission. Mr. [**Known lastname 9671**]
was found to have a left femur fracture with associated hematoma
and was admitted to the orthopedic service.  During his
admission, Mr. [**Known lastname 90902**] metoprolol was held (both afternoon
and evening doses).  Mr. [**Known lastname 9671**] was transferred to the
orthopedic floor and was noted to be in atrial fibrillation at a
rate of 140 beats per minute, with a systolic blood pressure of
90mmHg.  A medicine consult was called and an ECG showed TWI and
ST depressions with a rapid rate.  His rate decreased to below
100 after administration of metoprolol. Mr. [**Known lastname 9671**] was
transferred to the cardiology service for further management of
his arrhythmia prior to orthopedic surgery for his hip fracture.
 His cardiac enzymes were noted to be elevated and a cardiac
catheterization was performed that showed multi-vessel disease.
He was referred to cardiac surgery.

Past Medical History:
Coumadin 2 mg daily
Metoprolol Tartrate 100 mg TID
Omeprazole 20 mg daily


Social History:
Mr. [**Known lastname 9671**] is a retired architect and lives at home with
wife. [**Name (NI) **] has two children, one who lives in [**Hospital1 789**], and one
who lives in [**Location **]).
He drinks three glasses of wine per day versus one glass of

Conclusions
Pre-CPB:
A probable thrombus is seen in the left atrial appendage.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF
50-55%). with borderline normal free wall function. There are
simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
The aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened. No aortic
regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are moderately thickened. Mild (1+)
mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.

[**2168-10-26**] Cardiac catheterization
1.  Coronary angiography in this right dominant system
demonstrated left main and three-vessel disease.  The LMCA had
an 80%
ostial lesion.   The proximal LAD had a 70% lesion.  The mid-LAD
had a
50% lesion.  The LCx had an ostial 95% lesion.  The mid-RCA had
a 95%
lesion.  2.  Limited resting hemodynamics revealed a normal
systemic
arterial pressure with a central aortic pressure of 101/60 mmHg.

.
[**2168-10-27**] Carotid Ultrasound
Minimal heterogeneous plaque in the distal common and proximal
internal carotid arteries on both sides. No evidence of a
hemodynamically significant stenosis on either side. The flow in
the vertebrals is prograde.
.
[**2168-10-25**] CT Scan
1. Moderate-to-large right simple pleural effusion and small
left pleural
effusion. No evidence of hemothorax.
2. Comminuted left femur fracture extending from the lesser
trochanter into the proximal left metadiaphysis as seen on the
previous radiograph.
3. Small amount of simple free fluid in the pelvis.
4. Arterially enhancing liver lesions are non-specific and might
represent
flash-filiing hemangiomas, adenomas, or areas of FNH. Further
nonurgent
evaluation with MRI is recommended.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 9671**] was admitted with a left femur fracture with
associated hematoma to the orthopedic service on [**2168-10-25**].
After his admission, Mr. [**Known lastname 90902**] metoprolol was held (both
afternoon and evening doses).  Mr. [**Known lastname 9671**] was transferred to
the orthopedic floor and was noted to be in atrial fibrillation
at a rate of 140 beats per minute, with a systolic blood
pressure of 90mmHg.  A medicine consult was called and an ECG
showed TWI and ST depressions with a rapid rate.  His rate
decreased to below 100 after administration of metoprolol. Mr.
[**Known lastname 9671**] was transferred to the cardiology service for further
management of his arrhythmia prior to orthopedic surgery for his
hip fracture.  His cardiac enzymes were noted to be elevated and
a cardiac catheterization was performed that showed multi-vessel
disease.  He was referred to cardiac surgery. Mr. [**Known lastname 9671**] was
worked-up in the usual preoperative manner.

On [**2168-10-27**] he underwent coronary artery bypass grafting times
three (Left internal mammary to left anterior descending,
saphenous vein graft to ramus, saphenous vein graft to posterior
descending artery) and ligation of his left atrial appendage
