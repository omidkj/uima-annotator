Pertinent Results:
FEMUR (AP & LAT) LEFT  [**2133-7-4**] 11:01 AM
IMPRESSION: Fracture and failure of the fixation plate from the
fixation screws with impaction at the original fracture site and
displacement of the pre- existing comminuted fractures. The
fixation screws through the femoral condyles remain intact.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2133-7-6**] 4:20 AM
FINDINGS: In comparison with study of [**2133-6-6**], there is again
enlargement of the cardiomediastinal silhouette, accentuated by
the portable AP technique.

FEMUR (AP & LAT) LEFT  [**2133-7-8**] 12:55 PM
FINDINGS: In comparison with study of [**8-3**], there is little
change in the appearance of the new fixation plate of the distal
left femur with screws fixing the comminuted fracture of the
distal femur. As on the previous study, the screw that is
closest to the top does not appear to be seated within the
femoral plate.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 17025**] presented to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2133-7-4**] after transfer
from [**Hospital3 3583**] with increasing left leg pain after hearing
a "[**Doctor Last Name **]" 4 days prior.  She was evaluated by the orthopaedic
surgery service and found that the left distal femur plate
pulled off the bone proximally.  She was admitted, consented,
and prepped for surgery.  Later that day she was taken to the
operating room and underwent a revision ORIF of her left distal
femur.  She was transfused with 2 units of packed red blood
cells due to acute blood loss anemia.  She was transferred to
the ICU post operatively due to hypovolemia and was treated with
a Neo-Synephrine drip.  On [**2133-7-5**] she was weaned off the
Neo-Synephrine drip and was seen by physical therapy to improve
her strength and mobility.  On [**2133-7-6**] she was again transfused
with 2 units of packed red blood cells due to acute blood loss
anemia.  She was transferred out of the intensive care unit on
[**2133-7-7**] to the orthopaedic floor.  On the floor she was seen by
physical therapy to improve her strength and mobility.  The
patient experied some nausea on [**2133-7-8**]. EKG performed on
[**2133-7-8**] demonstrated no acute ST changes.

The rest of her hospital stay was uneventful with her lab data
and vital signs within normal limits and her pain controlled.
She is being discharged today in stable condition.
