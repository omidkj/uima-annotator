Admission Date:  [**2132-1-30**]     Discharge Date:  [**2132-2-2**]

Date of Birth:   [**2069-2-2**]     Sex:  M

Service:  MICU [**Location (un) **]

REASON FOR ADMISSION:  Status post seizure with aspiration
pneumonia, intubated.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 62-year-old male with
multiple medical problems found down in his assisted-living
facility seizing in bed.  Of note, the patient had just been
discharged on the [**8-31**] from [**Hospital6 **]
after an unrevealing five day workup for abdominal pain.
Upon returning to the nursing home, he complained to his
nurse of a headache.  When the nurse returned with pain
medicine five minutes later, the patient was found to be
tonic-clonic seizures, unresponsive.  EMS was called.  When
they arrived, he was found to have aspirated a good amount of
food contents.  Was intubated for airway protection and
transferred to [**Hospital1 **] Hospital.

Of note, the patient seized for approximately 10 minutes, and
the seizures were broken by Valium 5 mg, Versed 2 mg, and
Ativan 2 mg.  At the time of the seizure, the patient's blood
sugar was noted to be 46.  He was given 1 amp of D50 and 1 mg
of glucagon, and the fingerstick glucose rose to 154.  En
route to the hospital, he was given lidocaine for question of
increased intracranial pressure.

At [**Hospital1 18**] ED, a CT of the head was performed, which showed
evidence of an old CVA, but no acute hemorrhage.  A LP was
performed and was negative.  The patient was given 2 grams of
Rocephin prior to the LP for meningitis prophylaxis.  He was
also given aspirin and Versed.  Of note on the patient's
admission EKG, he did have lateral ST depressions, which were
new compared with his prior EKGs from [**2128**] at [**Hospital6 2121**] as well as [**2128**].

At the time, the patient was unresponsive to deep painful
stimuli, but was minimally responsive to deep sternal rub.
In the Emergency Room, he continued to have food suctioned
from his ET tube, but he was able to maintain his oxygenation
and ventilation.  On the ventilator, he was transferred to
the MICU.

BRIEF SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE BY ISSUES:
1. Seizures:  It was unclear exactly why the patient seized.
It is likely that he has underlying areas of ischemia
secondary to massive CVA.  He seems to have suffered anoxic
brain injury as he had several episodes of myoclonic jerks,
which could be consistent with [**Doctor First Name **]-[**Location (un) 1683**] syndrome as well
as some component of hypoglycemia.  An EEG was performed,
which shows diffuse slow wave pattern, which ruled out status
epilepticus and suggest some sort of encephalopathy perhaps
due to sepsis.

The patient's psychotropic medications Lamictal and Effexor
were discontinued.  His blood sugar was monitored q.i.d. and
kept euglycemic.  TSH, calcium, magnesium, and phosphorus as
well as a RPR were all unrevealing.  The patient did not
receive any Versed, and was still unresponsive for 48 hours
on the ventilator.  We did consider getting a MRI, however,
due to the patient's penile prosthesis, this was not
possible.

Neurology felt that most likely this was anoxic brain injury,
and the chance of recovery was very poor as the patient was
unresponsive to deep painful stimuli.  Cold calorics were
unreactive.  Dolls eyes were abnormal.  The patient did have
not spontaneous respirations when he was extubated.

2. Aspiration pneumonia:  Originally the diagnosis of
aspiration pneumonia was entertained given the food contents
were suctioned from the ET tube.  Repeat chest films were
negative, however, the patient was placed on levofloxacin and
Flagyl for 48 hour period until the chest x-ray was
definitively clear.

3. Respiratory failure:  Patient was intubated for airway
protection.  ABG showed excellent oxygenation and
ventilation.  However, the patient had no spontaneous
respirations when the ventilator was discontinued.

4. Diabetes mellitus:  The NPH was held.  The patient was
kept euglycemic on insulin-sliding scale.

5. Coronary artery disease:  The patient did have mild
elevation of the troponins, but CKs were negative although
rising in the setting of lateral T-wave changes, and lateral
ST depressions.  It is likely that the patient did experience
some sort of demand ischemia with whatever inciting events
had occurred.  He was given aspirin and beta blocker,
however, Heparin was not initiated due to his allergy of
unknown type.

6. Renal failure:  He appeared to be at his baseline
creatinine of 1.8.

7. GERD:  He was continued on his proton-pump inhibitor.

8. Ophthalmology:  He was continued on his eyedrops per
outpatient regimen.

9. Chronic pancreatitis:  He was repleted with Creon.

10. Zyprexa.  All psychotropic medications were discontinued.

11. FEN:  The patient was kept NPO.

12. Access:  An A-line was placed for arterial monitoring and
pneumoboots were used for DVT prophylaxis.

13. Code status:  Discussion with the [**Hospital 228**] healthcare
proxy, it was felt that the patient would want to be do not
resuscitate/do not intubate comfort measures only given his
prior poor functional status and new diagnosis with extremely
poor prognosis.  Therefore, after discussion wi
