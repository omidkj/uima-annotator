Brief Hospital Course:
66 yo F with PMH of severe COPD on 2L home O2 and severe anxiety
who presented [**10-13**] to [**Hospital1 18**] and was admitted to the MICU for
shortness of breath related to a COPD exacerbation, then
transferred to the medical floor for further management.

# COPD exacerbation: The patient described an increased
productive cough and worsening dyspnea in the setting of a
recent viral syndrome and increased smoking. She has a
significantly reduced FEV1 of 24% predicted and has severe COPD
on baseline home O2 of 2L NC. Patient afebrile with no evidence
of pneumonia on CXR. Received azithromycin 250mg PO x 5 days
(last dose 9/22). Also received one 100mg dose of doxycycline to
cover MRSA; this was stopped when the final sputum culture came
back. She was treated with methylprednisolone 60mg IV q6h on
admission, then switched to PO prednisone 60mg on [**10-14**]. She will
be discharged on a prednisone taper. She received scheduled
albuterol nebs q4h and was written for ipratropium nebs q6h
which she refused. On the floor, her O2 requirement was weaned
back to her baseline of 2L O2 via nasal cannula; her sats were
maintained 88-92%. On the day of discharge (after receiving a
nebulizer treatment), rest saturation was 93% on 2L, then
ambulatory saturation was down to 88% on 2L. She was counseled
about smoking cessation.

# Elevated bicarbonate: Has chronically elevated bicarbonate,
likely related to CO2 retention from COPD.

# Anxiety/Depression: The patient has a noteable tremor on exam
which she attributes to recently decreased dose xanax. She was
continued on her home dose and encouraged to speak to her
psychiatrist about possibly increasing the dose if she is not
able to tolerate the lower dose. Risperdal and paroxetine were
also continued.

# Prophylaxis: Patient received heparin products during this
admission.

# Code status: Full code
