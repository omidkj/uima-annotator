Service:  [**Hospital1 212**] MEDICINE

HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an
86-year-old female with a past medical history significant
for hypertension and atrial fibrillation on Coumadin with
bilateral lower extremity edema who was originally referred
to the Emergency Room from her PCPs office for increased
lower extremity edema.

In the Emergency Department, she said that she fell three
days prior to admission and hit her forehead on her
refrigerator.  There was no loss of consciousness at that
time.  She does report increased frequency of falling at home
over the past three weeks.  She reports feeling weak and
tired when she fell in the kitchen when she struck her head.
Besides having no loss of consciousness she also reports no
memory deficits.  She had a headache, no nausea or vomiting,
neck stiffness in the last two days.

In the Emergency Room, a CT scan was performed which showed a
small right frontal subdural hematoma.  In the Emergency
Room, the patient received Lasix 40 mg IV times one, K-Dur 40
mEq times one, vitamin K 10 mg IV times one, and then was
admitted to the MICU under the Neurosurgery Service.

MEDICATIONS AT HOME:
1.  Coumadin.
2.  Verapamil.
3.  Hydrochlorothiazide.

ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Hypertension.
2.  Atrial fibrillation.
3.  Bilateral lower extremity edema.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  D&C.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  She is married.  She lives with her husband
at home.  Independent lifestyle.  No tobacco.  No alcohol
use.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Mother with CHF.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Vital signs:  Temperature
96.8, pulse 75, blood pressure 135/74, respirations 14, 100%
on room air.  General:  Alert and oriented times three,
cooperative.  HEENT:  Unequal pupils, left greater than
right, both are reactive to light, atraumatic.  Neurologic:
Cranial nerves II through XII were grossly intact.  Strength:
Normal in all extremities.  Sensation intact.  No pronator
drift.  Neck:  Nontender, atraumatic.  Cardiovascular:
Irregularly/irregular, II/VI systolic ejection murmur at the
left sternal border.  Lungs:  A few crackles at the bilateral
bases, good air movement.  Abdomen:  Soft, nondistended,
nontender, positive bowel sounds.  Extremities:  There was 4+
pitting edema of the bilateral lower extremities above the
hips.

INITIAL LABORATORY DATA:  White count 6.5, hematocrit 27.9,
MCV 77, RDW 16, platelets 230,000.  The Chem-7 was remarkable
for a potassium of 3.1.  The INR was 2.3.

The initial chest x-ray showed cardiomegaly and mild vascular
redistribution.

The EKG showed atrial fibrillation.

The head CT showed a right subdural hematoma, subacute.

ASSESSMENT:  This is an 86-year-old female with a history of
hypertension and A fib on Coumadin with a subdural hematoma
status post fall at home.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  1.  SUBDURAL HEMATOMA:  The patient was
originally admitted to the MICU under the Neurosurgery
Service to follow the patient for one day.  There, in the
MICU, the primary concern was lowering the patient's INR from
the admission INR of 2.3 down to below 1.3 for her subdural
hemorrhage.  She was originally given 4 units of FFP with
eventual fall of her INR from 2.3 to 1.6.

Her MICU course was then complicated by flash pulmonary edema
with A fib and rapid ventricular response.  For this, she
received additional Lasix as well as a brief course on a
Diltiazem drip which broke the RVR.  The patient received
frequent neurologic checks and was deemed stable from a
neurosurgery standpoint.  They decided that there was no need
to evacuate the hematoma at this time and that could be
followed.

The patient was given 2 more units of FFP before transfer to
the floor.  On the floor, the patient received 5 mg of
vitamin K.  By the day of discharge, her INR had fallen to
1.3.

2.  CARDIOVASCULAR:  The patient was with increasing lower
extremity edema and CHF like symptoms.  The patient was given
multiple doses of Lasix throughout her hospital course with
good response in diuresis.  The patient also had an episode
of flash pulmonary edema after receiving FFP in the MICU for
which she received additional Lasix.  She also was in an A
fib rhythm throughout her hospital course with one episode of
RVR which had to be controlled with a Diltiazem drip.  The
patient was then switched from verapamil to Diltiazem p.o.

The patient continued to have A fib throughout her hospital
course; however, only that one episode of rapid ventricular
response.  The patient's blood pressure was stable throughout
all times during the hospital course.

The patient received an echocardiogram on the day of
discharge to fully evaluate her heart function which revealed
a left ventricular ejection fraction of 60-65% and a TR
gradient of 25-30 mmHg.  The left atrium was normal in size.
Overall left ventricular systolic function was normal.  Right
ventricular wall cavity was markedly dilated with depressed
systolic function.  There was physiologic mitral
regurgitation and 1+ tricuspid regurgitation.  There was
borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.  No
pericardial effusion.

Compared with the prior report of [**2160-1-1**], the right
ventricle had become dilated and the function decreased.
Given this information, it was decided that the patient would
be stable for discharge.

3.  PT/OT:  The patient was evaluated by the PT and OT
Service due to her recent increase in falls for her fall risk
and also for general deconditioning.  The patient was deemed
to be a suitable candidate for acute rehabilitation stay.

4.  ANEMIA:  The patient is with known history of
iron-deficiency anemia.  The patient did have a low
hematocrit during her hospital course of 23.6.  The patient
received 2 units of packed red blood cells and had an
appropriate increase in her hematocrit to 29.2.  Her
hematocrit thereafter was stable and the patient was started
on iron supplementation therapy.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Subdural hemorrhage in the right frontal region.
2.  General deconditioning with falls.
3.  Dilated right ventricle.
4.  Iron-deficiency anemia.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Cardizem CD 120 mg p.o. q.d.
2.  Lasix 40 mg p.o. q.d.
3.  K-Dur 20 mEq p.o. q.d.
4.  Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d., hold for loose stools.
5.  Iron sulfate 325 mg p.o. q.d.
6.  Tylenol 325 to 650 mg p.o./p.r. q. 4-6 hours p.r.n.
7.  Hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg p.o. q.d.
8.  Artificial tears one to two drops O.U. p.r.n.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Good.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  To [**Hospital **] [**Hospital **] Hospital for
inpatient rehab stay.  The patient should have her
electrolytes including potassium and creatinine checked every
two to three days and have her electrolytes repleted
appropriately.  The patient should be weighed every day and
should have her dose of Lasix increased appropriately should
she gain more than [**3-5**] pounds per day.

FOLLOW-UP:  The patient is to follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 665**], her
PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] the future.
