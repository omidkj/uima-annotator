Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 905**]
Chief Complaint:
Lower gastrointestinal blees

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
1. Colonoscopy
2. Tagged RBC GI bleeding study


History of Present Illness:
Pt. is an 83y/o F with a PMH of diverticulosis recently
discharged on [**2192-5-29**] s/p LGIB secondary to bleeding
diveriticulus admitted [**6-3**] with BRBPR.
.
During prior hospitalization pt. was admitted with a 2 week
history of BRBPR at home. On [**5-21**] a diverticular bleed found on
first colonoscopy, epi injected, but patient with continued LGIB
which was seen in the distal sigmoid on tagged RBC study [**5-24**].
The bleeding was not deemed amenable to angio intervention.
Repeat colonoscopy on [**5-25**] not able to identify further source of
bleeding. Pt discharged on [**5-29**] with a stable hct.
.
Since that time Pt. was doing well at home until she again had
an episode of BRBPR which she reported to fill the commode. Pt.
also reported L chest pain occurring episodically over the past
few days. Pt. brought to ED by her daughter yesterday. In ED
vitals: temp 97, HR 110, BP 161/90, RR 18 O2sat 98% 4LNC. Pt.
soaked her pad on ED bed with BRB. Labs included HCT 37,
unremarkable CBC, electrolytes, CEs and LFTs. CXR unremarkable.
EKG SR@ 105bpm, no ischemic changes, unchanged from prior. Pt.
given SL NTGx1, morphine 2mg IVx1, was given 2L NS. Admitted to
MICU for further evaluation.
.
In MICU pt. was transfused 2U PRBCs. Surgery consulted and felt
no acute intervention was needed. GI consulted, deferred
colonoscopy at this time.  UA positive and pt. started on cipro.
B-blocker initially held due to bleeding, restarted [**6-4**].

[**2192-6-5**]: GI Bleeding Study
INTERPRETATION: Following intravenous injection of autologous
red blood cells labeled with Tc-[**Age over 90 **]m, blood flow and dynamic
images of the abdomen for minutes were obtained. A left lateral
view of the pelvis was also obtained at 90 minutes.
Blood flow images show no evidence of radiotracer extravasation.

Dynamic blood pool images show no evidence of radiotracer
extravasation.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of GI bleeding.

[**6-6**] Colonoscopy:
Findings:
 Mucosa: Normal mucosa was noted in the sigmoid colon,
descending colon, transverse colon and ascending colon.
 Excavated Lesions Multiple diverticula were seen throughout the
colon.There was no active bleeding noted.
Impression: Diverticulosis of the colon
Normal mucosa in the sigmoid colon, descending colon, transverse
colon and ascending colon Otherwise normal colonoscopy to mid
ascending colon
Recommendations:
1. No active bleeding noted although pt could have bleed from
these diverticuli.
2. Follow serial Hct
3. If continues to bleed, need repeat bleeding scan/angio and
surgical consult.
Additional notes: 1. Procedure done with attending supervision.

[**2192-6-7**]: CXR INDICATION: Chest pain. Gastrointestinal bleed.
Cardiac silhouette is upper limits of normal in size. Vascular
pedicle has decreased in width and pulmonary vascularity appears
less engorged, consistent with overall improvement in volume
status of the patient. There are hazy areas of poorly defined
opacity in both upper lungs, right greater than left.
Differential diagnosis includes asymmetric edema versus focal
aspiration or infection. Small pleural effusions are unchanged.

Brief Hospital Course:
Pt. is an 83y/o F with a PMH of diverticulosis recently
discharged on [**2192-5-29**] s/p LGIB secondary to bleeding
diveriticulus admitted [**6-3**] with BRBPR.

# Diverticulosis - During prior hospitalization pt. was admitted
with a 2 week history of BRBPR at home. On [**5-21**] a diverticular
bleed found on first colonoscopy, epi injected, but patient with
continued LGIB which was seen in the distal sigmoid on tagged
RBC study [**5-24**]. The bleeding was not deemed amenable to angio
intervention. Repeat colonoscopy on [**5-25**] not able to identify
further source of bleeding. Pt discharged on [**5-29**] with a stable
hct. Since that time Pt. was doing well at home until she again
had an episode of BRBPR which she reported to fill the commode
the day prior to admission. She was admitted to MICU for further
evaluation. In MICU pt. was transfused 2U PRBCs. Surgery
consulted and felt no acute intervention was needed. GI
consulted, deferred colonoscopy at this time. UA positive and
pt. started on cipro. B-blocker initially held due to bleeding,
restarted [**6-4**] at 12.5mg [**Hospital1 **]. She had no further epsiodes of
bleeding and was deemed stable for transfer to the floor. After
transfer pt. had one episode of BRBPR. GI bleeding study was
completed but no source of bleeding localized. IR consulted and
felt she was not amendable to angiography at this time. Pt. also
seen by surgery who felt no acute procedure was needed. Pt. was
found to have a HCT of 30.1 and she was transfused an additional
2U PRBC with appropriate increase in HCT. Pt. had repeat
colonoscopy on [**2192-6-6**] which demonstrated diverticulum but no
clear source of bleeding. She had no further of episodes of
bleeding during admission. Her diet was advanced to regular and
was tolerated well. She had a stable HCT through the remainder
of her hospital stay and was deemed stable for discharge home.
Pt. developed loose stools the day prior to admission. First C.
diff toxin negative. Pt. had not having large volume diarrhea.
Repeat C. diff toxin sent prior to discharge and pt. informed to
contact PCP to follow up results as outpatient.
.
# UTI - Pt. had a positive UA on presentation to the ED. Her
culture was mixed flora. She was treated with a three day course
of cipro. Pt. was also found to have hematuria which was likely
caused by trauma secondary to foley insertion. She was advised
to follow up for further evaluation with PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) 907**] UA prior to
discharge was negative for blood.
.
# Chest Discomfort - Pt. has history of mild NSTEMI from demand
ischemia from previous hospitalization for GI bleed. Echo
obtained showed LVOF obstruction in
setting of hyperdynamic sta
