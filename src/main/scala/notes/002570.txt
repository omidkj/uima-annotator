acute cardiopulmonary process.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 89-yo M w/extensive comorbidities who present with  sudden
onset SOB while at his nursing home, likely to have UGIB given
his melena

...
# SOB:  His shortness of breath was thought to be secondary to
his aspiration as he had been complaining of difficulty
swallowing after his recent CEA.  He also did show increased
risk of aspiration on a bedside swallow examination during his
hospitalization.  His chest xray on admission was negative for
signs of volume overload, although his oxygen saturation and
comfort improved with some diuresis.  He was continued on
albuterol and ipratropium nebulizers with good relief.  A V/Q
scan done on admission was low probability for pulmonary
embolism.  He required 4L of oxygen at time of discharge to
maintain his oygen saturation.
...
# GIB. This was likely an  UGIB due to supratherapeutic INR. He
had no history of NSAID use or EtOH use, his colonoscopy 3
years ago was negative per patient while at [**Hospital3 **].
He received 3 units of PRBC, although his hematocirt slowly
trended down with occasional melena.  He was started on protonix
and his INR was reversed with FFP and vitamin K, but secondary
to his respiratory status, he was felt to be a poor candidate
for egd and colonoscopy.

....
# ARF: His initial presentation of acute renal failure was
likely secondary to dehydration as his FeNa was 1% in the
setting of home diuretics, rare urine eosinophils, but no
peripheral eosinophils were found. He responded well to
hydration, but then his creatinine worsened with likely
overdiuresis.  Laboratory monitoring was held after the patient
became comfort measures.

...
#Elevated WBC: The patient was without a clear source of
infection, he was afebrile although with a WBC up to 14.2 with
78%PMN.  His chest xray was clear, blood, urine, stool cultures
were negative.
.

#Elevated Lactate:  His lactate peaked at 2.9 but trended down.
The etiology was unclear, he was monitored with serial abdominal
exams for possible bowel ischemia, given his leukocytosis,
although unlikely given his elevated INR
.
# ANEMIA
He received 3 units of PRBC, he anemia was likely secondary to
GI blood loss
-
...
# RECENT L CEA.  His surgeons were contact[**Name (NI) **] in regards to
holding his plavix given his recent CEA and now acute GI blood
loss. He was to continue plavix, but as the patient was changed
to comfort measures, plavix was held.

..
# HTN/AFIB/CAD
His home lasix, and antihypertensive were held in the setting of
comfort measures only

...
# DEPRESSION
His home medications were held in the setting of comfort
measures only
...
# PPx
- Activity as tolerated
...
# FEN: He was evaluated to have aspiration risk, but given his
comfort measures status, he was continued on a regular diet as
tolerated
