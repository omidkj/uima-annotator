This is a summary summarizing the events from [**2126-4-21**]
from the patient's admission to the Fenard ICU to the date of
her death.

REASON FOR ADMISSION TO THE FENARD ICU:  GI bleed.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Patient is a 48-year-old woman
with history of ALL diagnosed in [**6-6**] status post MUD-allo
BMT day number 57 after Cytoxan/TBI.  Current problems
include febrile neutropenia (afebrile since [**2126-4-12**]),
anasarca/CHF, GVHD (skin, bowel, and liver), acute renal
failure, bilirubinemia, pancytopenia.

Patient developed diffuse abdominal pain yesterday in the BMT
unit and was mildly uncomfortable with tachypnea on exam.
Abdominal and pelvic CTs showed bilateral pleural effusions
left greater than right unchanged from previous.  Unchanged
bibasilar atelectasis, extensive diffuse subcutaneous edema,
and intra-abdominal pelvic ascites all with interval
increasing severity.  Gallbladder nondistended, minimal
straining around the kidneys, no hydronephrosis, no free air,
several loops of dilated small bowel in the left upper
quadrant with contrast and air-fluid levels concerning for
partial SBO versus ileus and no definite bowel wall
thickening or transition point.  Patient had a hematocrit
drop from 20 to 16 over the last 24 hours and melena late
last night.  No prior GI history.  She was transfused 2 units
of packed red blood cells and 2 units of platelets.  She was
hemodynamically stable but sent to the ICU for closer
monitoring.

Over the last 3 days, husband reports decrease in alertness
and mental status.  She was started on a Lasix drip yesterday
after running at positive for weeks.  Urine output has
trailed off over the last few days and she has only had less
than 200 cc over the last 8 hours of urine output.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Mother with CVA, father with prostate
cancer.  Married.  Lives with husband, 3 cats.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Owns laundry company.  Tobacco, 35 pack
years, quit 1 year ago.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs on admission:  Temperature
95.2 degrees, BP 133/79, pulse 77, saturations 95 percent on
2 liters.  In general, patient had generalized anasarca,
mumbling incoherently with no apparent distress.  HEENT:
Pupils equal, round, and reactive to light.  Supple.  Mucus
membranes mildly dry.  Tracks with eyes, sclerae icteric.
Neck:  Unable to assess JVD, lymphadenopathy secondary to
subcutaneous swelling.  Thorax:  Coarse upper airway sounds
anteriorly and laterally bilaterally.  Cardiovascular:
Regular rate and distant heart sounds.  Abdomen:  Hypoactive
bowel sounds.  No significant tenderness to palpation.
Petechiae across the abdomen.  Extremities:  GVHD bilateral
lower extremities, 4 plus lower extremity edema.  Neurologic:
Opens eyes and tracks, response but mumbles incomprehensibly,
does not move extremities spontaneously.

LABORATORY DATA:  On admission:  White blood cell count 0.4
with an ANC of 260, hematocrit was 18.7 down from 26, and
platelets were 59.  Chemistry 7 was unremarkable except for a
potassium of 5.2 and a creatinine of 3.1.  INR was 1.5,
phosphorus was 5.8, ALT 50, AST 44, LDH 275, alkaline
phosphatase 103.  Total bilirubin 8.8, direct bilirubin 6.8.
UA:  Uric acid 7.5.

IMPRESSION:  Patient is a 48-year-old female with ALL day
number 57 of allo-MUD BMT admitted to the intensive care unit
for closer monitoring of gastrointestinal bleeding and acute
renal failure.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  GI bleed.  Patient had an EGD performed in
the ICU which showed esophagitis with friable mucosa likely
secondary to chemotherapy.  Her hematocrits were monitored
thrice daily, but they continued to drop as patient continued
to bleed in a very friable mucosa through her esophagus.  It
was suggested that patient most likely had a severe
esophagitis from her chemotherapy drugs.  We were unable to
use Carafate given her questionable ileus versus obstruction.
She was maintained on Protonix twice daily until the decision
was made to make the patient comfort measures only as
described below.  Patient's platelet count also remained low
at 11.  Given that patient was comfort measures only, no
further hematocrits were checked or platelets.

Respiratory failure.  Patient was intubated on the first
hospital day for airway protection/aspiration.  She was
requiring Flovent support.  Event settings were not changed
since the patient's family was deciding on CMO status and
arterial blood gases could not be drawn.

ALL.  Patient is day number 57 of allo-BMT also with GVHD.
Her Solu-Medrol was continued initially but then subsequently
discontinued in anticipation for extubation.  Since her
prognosis was so poor, cyclosporin was also held due to lack
of access.  Given she was not on oral intake, her Ursodiol
and Entocort were also held during the hospital course in the
ICU.

Febrile neutropenia.  Patient had coag negative
staphylococcus, bacteremia, and positive CMV viremia, she was
continued on cefepime 1 gram intravenous every day, renal
dose caspofungin, ganciclovir, and foscarnet were
discontinued since they were both nephrotoxic and patient
would not be dialyzed.

Acute renal failure and generalized anasarca.  The patient's
admission weight was 200 pounds and now she was 330 pounds on
admission despite thrice daily Lasix and Lasix drip.  She had
massive anasarca most likely from GVHD, renal failure,
hypoalbuminemia, nephrotoxic medications.  Renal did consult
initially but decided that they would not perform
hemodialysis since it is unlikely to change the course of her
medical condition and heparin would only cause further
bleeding.  Patient was hyperkalemic during her hospital
course and was given insulin and D50, but could not give
Kayexalate since she was not on oral intake and parenteral
Kayexalate could not be given since she was neutropenic.
Family was aware that patient may have a fatal arrhythmia
with such high potassium (the team had spoken to the husband
extensively) and no further electrolytes were checked during
her hospital course after her high potassium was 6.8.

History of DVT.  Patient was not on any anticoagulation given
her thrombocytopenia.

GVHD.  Patient had a lower extremity rash also with GVHD of
the bowel and liver.  Her steroids Ursodiol and Entocort were
all discontinued secondary to poor prognosis and lack of
access.

Hypotension.  Patient was maintained on dopamine for blood
pressure support and remained on this medication during her
entire hospital stay until the family decided to extubate the
patient and make her comfort measures only.

Acute mental status.  Patient had encephalopathy secondary to
uremia and medications including narcotics and
benzodiazapine.  Patient was then sedated after her
intubation and had no further issues regarding this.

Fluids, electrolytes, nutrition.  Patient was maintained on
nothing by mouth status given her severe mucositis and had
numerous electrolyte abnormalities given uremia and anuric
and that no dialysis was indicated per the renal team, number
14 code.  Patient was immediately made CPR not indicated and
this was readdressed with the family on [**2126-4-21**].  The family
took many days to decide on CMO status since they were still
not at terms with her grave prognosis.  There were several
meetings with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 1557**], patient's primary oncologist, who
agreed that pat
