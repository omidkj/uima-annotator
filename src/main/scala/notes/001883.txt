Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 30**]
Chief Complaint:
GI Bleed

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
1. Mesenteric Angiography.
2. Enteroscopy w/ Cautery and Tattoo.


History of Present Illness:
This a 71 year old female with multiple medical problems
including recurrent GI bleed, coronary artery disease,
hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, gastritis,
hypercholesterolemia, chronic renal insufficiency and depression
who presents to the ED after finding her blood pressure to be
84/54 at home on the day of admission.  Patient reports having
worsening dyspnea on exertion, dark stools, dizziness with
standing and chest pressure with walking x 3-4 days.  Patient
has a history of upper GI bleed secondary to gastritis ([**4-27**])
and a negative workup for a duodenal neuro-endocrine tumor.
Most recent hospitalization for bleeding was secondary to small
bowel AVMs found on EGD. Denies changes in diet, fever/chills,
abdominal pain, recent alcohol consumption, nausea/vomitting or
recent trauma. Patient has been taking a baby ASA daily and iron
pills three times daily.
.
In the emergency room, the patient was found to have a Hct of
15.6 and HR or 61.  She received intravenous fluids and 40 mg of
intravenous protonix. A nasogastric lavage was performed which
did not reveal an active bleed but also failed to produce bile.
Patient was tranfused two units of PRBCs and her Hct
subsequently rose to 23. GI was consulted and the patient was
admitted to medicine for further observation.

C1894 INT.SHTH NOT/GUID,EP,NONLASER  [**2103-7-16**] 7:12 AM
Reason: embolize site of ooze in proximal jejenum.
IMPRESSION: Selective arteriography of the superior mesenteric
artery and jejunal branches demonstrated no evidence of
arteriovenous malformation or active hemorrhage.
.
ECHO [**2103-7-17**]
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is severe symmetric
left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size
is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF 60%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. The aortic root is mildly dilated. The ascending
aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are
mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The left
ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation. There
is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.




Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 71 year old female with multiple medical problems who
presented with GI bleed.

1. GIB: A push enteroscopy was performed that revealed melena in
the duodenum and fresh blood in the proximal jejunum 80-90 cm
from teeth. Copious irrigation and epinephrine injection failed
to halt the bleeding. On the floor her Hct dropped to 16 from 23
and the pt became tachycardic, so she was transferred to the
MICU.
.
In the MICU, patient received 4U and went from Hct of ~15 to low
30s. She received 1 more unit given cardiac status to bring
Hct>30. Upon transfer to MICU IR consulted for embolization,
however pt was unstable with MI. Cardiology saw patient on [**7-14**]
felt CEs were trending downward and recommended IR embolization
to stop bleed in proximal jejunum. Patient was subsequently
transferred to the medicine floor.

IR was unable to embolize the source of bleed and so patient
underwent repeat endoscopy with successful cauterization of the
site of bleed. The site was also tattooed. Patient received an
additional unit of PRBCs on the floor and her hematocrit
remained stable and she also was continued on protonix [**Hospital1 **].
.
2. NSTEMI- She developed chest pain and EKG showed ST depression
in V4-V6. Cardiac troponin peaked at 2.5. NSTEMI was likely
secdonary to demand ischemia with tachycardia in setting of her
GI bleed.  She was started on BB. Plaxix and asapirin were held
given history of GI bleed. Cardiology saw patient on [**7-14**] felt
CEs were trending downward and recommended IR embolization to
stop bleed in proximal jejunum. A repeat ECHO on [**2103-7-17**] was
mainly unchanged aside from increased left ventricular
hypertrophy. Patient had remained chest pain free from the time
of tranfer from the MICU to the day of discharge.
.
3.HTN- On the floor, blood pressure was not as well controlled
off nitro drip and beta blocker. Patient was transitioned from
PO nitrates and hydralazine to beta blocker and [**Last Name (un) **].
.
4. Acute on CRI- Cr 2.5 on admission from baseline Cr 1.6-1.9.
Creaine was within baseline at 1.7 at time of discharge.
.
5. Hypernatremia- Was thought to be likely secondary to normal
saline boluses and free water loss.  PO intake was encouraged
was resolved by time of discharge.
.
6. Anemia- patient was found to have iron deficiency anemia and
vitamin B12 deficient.  Patient was started on vitamin B12
1000mcg oral supplementation QD.
