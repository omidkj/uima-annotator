Allergies:
Haldol

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5790**]
Chief Complaint:
tracheal stenosis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2138-6-26**]:
Flexible bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage
and cervical tracheal resection and reconstruction.
[**2138-7-3**]: bronchoscopy


History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 47-year-old
gentleman who has had a tracheostomy for some time and has
been unable to be decannulated due to a peristomal stenosis.
The total length of the abnormality in the trachea was 5 cm,
but I thought the central portion of this, which was right at
the stoma, was actually only about 2.5 to 3 cm.  Therefore,
despite his ongoing immunosuppression for a kidney
transplant, I recommended resection of the stenosis and
reconstruction.  After an abundant discussion preoperatively,
the patient did understand that he is at increased risk for
anastomotic complication, including dehiscence, necrosis, and
incomplete alleviation of stenosis.  Most specifically, the
immunosuppression prevents healing and he understood that
this would potentially complicate his healing of the
anastomosis.  Nevertheless, he did not want to continue with
his tracheostomy tube in place and elected to go forward with
surgery, despite understanding that the option would be to
leave the tracheostomy tube as it was.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. PO diet: thin liquids, regular consistency solids.
2. Meds whole with water.
3. [**Hospital1 **] oral care.
4. Please call, page, or re-consult if there are any concerns on
this diet.

DC CXR on [**2138-7-1**]
FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no
relevant
change. Left pleural effusions, slightly improved ventilation of
the right
lower lung. Massive cardiomegaly with signs of moderate
pulmonary edema. No evidence of newly appeared focal parenchymal
opacities suggesting pneumonia.
