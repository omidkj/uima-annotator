atrium or left atrial appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen
by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are
normal. There is mild regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction with LVEF of 45%. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 45 %). There is hypokinesia
of the apex, apical and mid portions of the anterior wall and
anterior septum. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. with normal free wall contractility. There
are simple atheroma in the aortic arch. There are simple
atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. There are three
aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis. Mild (1+) aortic

revascularization. Her underwent appropriate surgical work-up
which included carotid U/S, pulmonary function tests and echo.
He was medically managed which included Nitroglycerin and
Heparin gtt, along with antibiotics for cellulitis on left
thigh. Surgery also was delayed for a work-up of GI bleed. On
[**9-15**] he was cleared for surgery by GI and brought to the
operating room where he underwent a coronary artery bypass graft
x 3. Please see operative note for surgical details. Following
surgery he was transferred to the CVICU for invasive monitoring
in stable condition. Within 24 hours he was weaned from
sedation, awoke neurologically intact and extubated. He was
disoriented to place post-operatively, but his exam was
non-focal.  He also experienced paroxysmal atrial fibrillation
which resolved.  He was transferred to the floor to begin
increasing his activity level. Beta blockade titrated and he was
gently diuresed toward his preop weight. Chest tubes and pacing
wires removed per protocol.  He was cleared for discharge by Dr.
