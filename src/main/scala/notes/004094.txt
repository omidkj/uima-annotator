Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 10644**]
Chief Complaint:
Abdominal pain.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
1) US guided paracentesis
2) right IJ
3) ERCP


History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 18323**] is a 41 year old female with history of metastatic
melanoma status post recent spinal fusion surgery for multiple
metastatic spinal lesions, recently discharged from the surgical
service on [**2140-8-31**], who was transferred from an OSH today with
severe abdominal pain. On [**8-31**] (the day of discharge), at around
midnight she was awoken from sleep by the sudden onset of LLQ
abdominal pain which she cannot quantify or qualify, but states
that it felt as though her abdomen was bursting open. Her pain
then migrated to the LUQ and has remained a diffuse pain in the
epigastric region. The pain does not radiate to her back and she
cannot report a certain position which makes the pain better.
She did experience some nausea upon arrival to the ED but she
does not report emesis. She has been constipated, and has
received suppositories. At home she had sweats but not fever per
her sister. She denies cough, chest discomfort, difficulty
urinating, worsening of her back pain, focal weakness, change in
bowel or bladder habits.

She presented to [**Hospital 1562**] Hospital where she was found to have a
WBC = 26K and ALP = 182, amylase = 283, lipase = 772. She
recived NS x 1L, dilaudid 3 mg IV, zofran 4 mg IV, and 4.5 mg IV
zosyn.  She was then transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED for further
management. In the ED her vitals on presentation were: 99, 113,
175/103, RR = 20, 97% O2 on room air. She received 8 mg IV
dilaudid, promethiazine, lorazepam 2mg IV, and zosyn 4.5 gm IV x
1. She was also given 4.5 L NS.  An NGT was placed.  A CT scan
of the abdomen demonstrated a dramatic worsening of disease.
She was evaluated by general surgery who thought that the
patient required ICU monitoring but did not see her as a
surgical patient. She was thus transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for
closer monitoring, pain control and fluid resuscitation. She had
an MRI of her spine prior to transfer, the result of which is
still pending.


Past Medical History:
Oncologic history:
1) Melanoma:  s/p wide local excision of melanoma of the left
groin on 02/[**2136**]. Path demonstrated superficial spreading

CT of head, bone scan demonstrated increased uptake.
2) Reflux
3) otosclerosis
4) Anorexia

Social History:
She is single, living with her mother.  She was living in
[**State 108**], but came to [**Location (un) 86**] recently for further treatment of
her melanoma.  She has a long drinking history, but hasn't drank
recently.

obtunded:  Falling asleep while talking.
HEENT: Dry mucous membranes, anicteric sclerae, NGT in place.
eEck: Tender to palpation on R aspect of her neck. Firm, fixed

tender R anterior cervical LAD.  Small LN felt on L lateral
side.
Lungs: Rales at bases b/l.
Cor: RR, tachycardic, no m/r/g.
ABD: Hypoactive bowel sounds, tender to palpation in LUQ/LLQ.

.
MRI Spine [**9-2**]:  Soft tissue mass involving L4, L5 and R psoas,
extending into retroperitoneum. spinal canal cannot be assessed
properly due to artifact from metal fusion device.

CT abd/pelvis [**9-2**]:  IMPRESSION:
1. Findings consistent with mild pancreatitis by CT with no
drainable collections.
2. Interval laminectomies and spinal fusion hardware spanning
the region of the previously identified pathological fracture of
L4. There is a large amount of associated fluid and foci of gas
anterior to the spine at this level along the left psoas muscle
and in the periaortic region. This is presumably postoperative
in nature but the possibility of infection cannot be entirely
excluded.
3. Redemonstration of numerous metastatic lesions with evidence
for disease progression given slight interval increase in size
over the short time interval. This is best demonstrated by the
increase in size of the pancreatic head mass.
4. Interval increase in development of multiple cysts within the
kidneys. Presumably physiologic follicles.

CXR [**9-2**]:  ?LLL infiltrate.


Brief Hospital Course:
## Pancreatitis - pt found to have pancreatitis with elevation
of amylase and lipase.  MRCP was done which showed proximal
pancreatic duct obstruction by tumor with distal dilation.  Pt
was made NPO and given IVF.  After some improvement in abdominal
pain and decrease in amylase and lipase, an ERCP was performed
with stenting of her pancreatic duct.  Pt's abdominal pain
gradually improved and amylase and lipase normalized.  Patient's
diet was advanced as tolerated however she took in minimal PO.
.
## Pain control - pt was on a dilaudid PCA.  An attempt was made
to transition her to a fentanyl patch and PO morphine for
breakthrough in preparation for discharge to rehab however,
patient did not tolerate the change.  Patient was resumed on the
PCA.
.
## Abdominal distention - pt developed increasing abdominal
distension thought to be secondary to narctoics for pain control
and bed rest.  She was encouraged to ambulate and given an
aggressive bowel regimen.  Also patient had ascites thought to
be secondary to malignant spread.  Patient was given IV lasix
with good diuresis and underwent US guided paracentesis with
drainage of 1.4 liters of bloody ascitic fluid.
.
## Fever, leukocytosis: pt experienced sporadic low grade fevers
which were attributed to her pancreatitis.  Labs did not reveal
a left shift or bandemia.  She remained without cough despite
question of pneumonia on a portable X-ray.  Initially she was
started on levofloxacin, but this was discontinued due to
abscence of symptoms and she remained without any cough or
clinical worsening following this.  Blood cx's were persistently
normal.  A UTI with enteroccocus on previous admission resolved
and urine cx was negative.  Pt's prior spine surgeyr sites were
monitored and no evidence of infection was found.  Urine grew
yeast, foley was removed and
