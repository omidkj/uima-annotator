HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  THis is an 83 year-old man with
a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease diagnosed
nine years ago.  He has been intubated twice.  The last time
was a year ago for this.  He has been off and on steroids for
two years.  He had a recent admission at [**Location (un) 745**] [**Hospital 3678**]
Hospital with a chronic obstructive pulmonary disease flare
from [**9-21**] to [**9-26**].  He was on a Prednisone taper and he
stopped his Prednisone two days prior to admission
misunderstanding the Prednisone taper.  The night prior to
admission he developed progressive shortness of breath
without chest pain, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,
cough, fevers or chills.  On the day of admission he could
not walk so he called 911 and presented to the Emergency
Department with O2 sats 87% on 100% nonrebreather.  He
received three partial nebulizers with moderate subjective
improvement.  His arterial blood gas at that time was 7.52,
46, 43.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Dyspnea on exertion at 70 feet, which is
stable, chronic lower extremity edema worse with Prednisone.
No angina.  No paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,
diarrhea, abdominal pain, skin eruptions.

LABORATORIES ON ADMISSION:  White count 6.8, hematocrit 42.3,

potassium 3.3, chloride 96, bicarbonate 38, BUN 32,
creatinine 1.1, glucose 202, CK 19.  Chest x-ray, no evidence
of pneumothorax.  Cardiomegaly without evidence of heart
failure.  Evidence of bolus emphysema as well as pulmonary
vascular hypertension.  PA and lateral was done on [**10-18**],
which showed left lower lobe scarring or collapse with no
studies to compare.  It is difficult to evaluate with respect
to chronicity, stable changes associated with chronic
emphysema.  No evidence of right upper lobe pulmonary nodule
or right sided rib fracture.  Electrocardiogram from [**2102-9-22**],
normal sinus rhythm rate at 68, axis 46, intervals .158,
.098, .423.  Q V1 to V3, R in V1, T wave inversion 1 and L, [**Street Address(2) 12255**] elevation in V1 to V4, [**Street Address(2) 4793**] depression V5 and 6.
Cardiac echocardiogram on [**10/2101**] showed left ventricular
enlargement, distal one third of septum anterior wall
inferior posterior wall and apex akinetic, EF of 40%.  RV,
RA, LA mild enlargement, 2 to 3+ AI, trace TR, pulmonary
hypertension.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  In the Emergency Department the patient
received intravenous Solu-Medrol nebulizer treatments and one
dose of Lasix, Azithromycin and was put on BIPAP.  He was
very clear that his code status was DNR/DNI.  He was
transferred to the MICU and was quickly moved to 100%
nonrebreather face mask in which he did well.  His pressure
dropped slightly after the Lasix and he received a small
fluid bolus with good response.  The following morning the
patient was stable and was transferred to the floor.

1.  Respiratory:  He was continued on a steroid taper and
changed to po steroids.  He was continued on a five day
course of Azithromycin and nebulizer treatments.  O2 was used
to maintain his O2 sat between 85 and 92%.  He was seen by
respiratory therapy.  He felt that his breathing much
improved although he felt that he might appreciate extra time
at rehab to reach his baseline.

2.  Endocrine:  The patient's finger sticks were elevated.
He has a history of glucose intolerance secondary to steroids
and with elevated steroids it was felt secondary to this.  He
was continued on NPH b.i.d. and a sliding scale insulin.

3.  FEN:  Lytes were replaced as needed.  the patient on po
potassium at home.

4.  It was noted that the patient's hematocrit dropped from
42 on admission to 37 to 33.9.  Rectal was performed, which
was heme negative.  The following day hematocrit was 35 and
it was felt this was most likely due to dilution.

5.  Prophylaxis:  The patient was on Protonix and VenoDyne.
The patient was seen by PT/OT who felt that the patient would
benefit from rehab.

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  Fair.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  To rehab.

DIAGNOSES:
1.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease flare.
2.  Hypertension.
3.  Coronary artery disease.
4.  Steroid induced glucose intolerance, insulin dependent.

7.  Diverticulosis.
8.  Benign prostatic hypertrophy status post transurethral
resection of the prostate.
