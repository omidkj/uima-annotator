Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] presented to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2135-10-27**] after an unwitnessed
fall at home.  He was evaluated by the orthopaedic surgery
department and found to have a left hip fracture.  He was
admitted, cleared for surgery by medicine and on [**2135-10-28**] was
taken to the operating room.  He tolerated the surgery well, was
extubated transferred to the recovery room.  In the recovery
room he was reintubated for respiratory depression leading to
respirator failure and then transferred to the surgical
intensive care unit.  His blood pressure was low after
reintubation and surgery which required pressors for a short
period of time.  He was weaned and extubated on [**2135-10-30**].  On
[**2135-10-30**] he was also transfused with 2 units of packed red blood
cells due to acute post operative anemia.  On [**2135-10-31**] he was
transferred out of the surgical intensive care unit to the
floor.  He was seen by physical therapy to improve his strength
and mobility.  He was also seen by nutrition and given
supplemental drinks and pudding to help with his nutritional
status.  The rest of his hospital stay was uneventful with his
lab data and vital signs within normal limits and his pain
controlled.  He is being discharged today in stable condition.
