Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2704**]
Chief Complaint:
Elective admission for coronary and carotid
angiography/angioplasty.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Angiography
Carotid [**First Name3 (LF) **] placement

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 67 year-old female with a PMHx significant for
CAD, HTN, and hypercholesterolemia, now referred for carotid and
coronary angiography and angioplasty.

Per report, she was recently admitted to [**Hospital 1474**] Hospital in
[**2157-12-14**] following 3 pre-syncopal episodes. At that time,
carotid angiography revealed 80-99% stenosis in the [**Country **]. No
intervention was performed. She was referred to a [**Country 1106**]
surgeon, and deemed a poor surgical candidate. Per records, she
had another dizzy spell in [**2158-1-14**] while on a cruise. This,
however, was in the setting of poor PO intake and generally
feeling unwell. She was subsequently referred to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in
consultation, and referred today for elective carotid and
coronary angiography with endovascular intervention.

She denies ever experiencing any episodes of amaurosis,
diplopia, visual loss,
focal weakness, focal numbness, incoordination, gait difficulty,
or headache. No chest pain, no orthopnea or PND.

She is being admitted to the CCU for close observation following
[**Country **] [**Country **] placement.

Past Medical History:
Coronary artery disease, no prior MI.
Hyperlipidemia
Hypertension
Hypothyroidism
Deafness
Carpal tunnel syndrome

Past surgical history:
Status post hysterectomy

Social History:
She is deaf and lives with her son. She communicates with ASL.
She does drink a few glasses of wine per week. She is an active
smoker and smokes [**1-15**] pack per day x 49 years. She is employed
as a housekeeper. Is active in all of her ADLs.

Pertinent Results:
[**2158-2-27**] CATHETERIZATION:

PTCA COMMENTS: Initial angiography demonstrated a tight 90%
lesion of the [**Country **] sparing the bulb in a tortuous segment.
Heparin was initiated. A 6F Shuttle sheath was taken into the
RCCA over a Supracore placed in the RECA. The lesion was crossed
with a Accunet Filterwire that was deployed distally.  The
lesion was then pre-dilated with a 2.5 x 20 mm Maverick at 8
ATM.  A 6.0 x 30 mm Acculink was then deployed at the origin of
the [**Country **] but the [**Country **] missed covering the distal lesion.
Attempts to deliver a 6.0 x 20 mm Acculink failed secondary to
incomplete expansion of the first [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] we post-dilated with
a 4.5 x 20 mm Maverick at 12 ATM.  We were then able to deliver
the 6.0 x 20 mm [**First Name3 (LF) **] distally and deploy it in overlapping
fashion.  Attempts to recapture the filter failed secondary to
inability to deliver beyond the proximal [**First Name3 (LF) **].  We post-dilated
the proximal [**First Name3 (LF) **] again with the 4.5 x 20 mm Maverick at 12
ATM.  The filter was then recaptured with some difficulty. Final
angiography demonstrated no residual stenoses, no dissections,
and normal flow.  The patient became hypotensive with catheter
and balloon manipulation around the carotid bulb, but this was
responsive to IV Phenylephrine.

COMMENTS:
1.  Access was retrograde via the right CFA to the selective
carotid,
subclavian, vertebral and coronary arteries.
2.  Coronary angiography in this left-dominant circulation
demonstrated
no flow-limiting coronary artery disease. The LMCA was normal.
The LAD, LCX and RCA had mild irregularity without significant
disease.
3.  Thoracic aorta:  Type I arch without lesions.
4.  Subclavian arteries:  Bilaterally normal without lesions.
5.  Carotid/vertebral arteries:  The RCCA was normal. There were
no
critical lesions in the [**Country **]. The [**Country **] filled the ipsilateral
ACA and
MCA with contralateral filling of the ACA. The right vertebral
was normal.  There were no lesions in the posterior cerebral or
cerebellar
arteries.  The left vertebral was normal.  The LCCA was normal.
The [**Doctor First Name 3098**] had a mid-segemnt 80-90% lesion with modest
calcification. The [**Doctor First Name 3098**] filled the MCA predominantly with the
ACA filled from the contralateral ACOM.
6.  Successful stenting of the [**Country **] was performed with
overlapping 6.0 x
30 mm and 6.0 x 20 mm Acculink stents.
7.  Angioseal of the groin was performed.

****************
DATA FROM OUTSIDE HOSPITAL:

[**2158-1-12**] Carotid Duplex: 80-99% stenosis at the origin of the
right internal carotid artery. The left side has a 16-49%
stenosis at its origin.

[**2158-1-12**] ECHO (OSH report): Normal LV size and function with EF
60-65%. Mild AS, peak/mean 26/15 mm Hg, peak aortic velocity 2.5
m/s. Mitral valve thickening, mitral annular calcification,
trace MR. RV size and function normal. No pericardial effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
67 year-old female with CAD, HTN, hypercholesterolemia and
active smoker, admitted for elective coronary  and carotid
angiography and endovascular intervention, now status post [**Country **]
[**Country **] placement.

1) Carotid stenosis s/p [**Country **] [**Country **] placement: Post-procedure,
she was continued on ASA, Plavix, as well as Lipitor. She was
noted to be relatively hypotensive in the CCU post-procedure
with SBP 80-90. She was bolused 1.5 liters of NS, then started
on Neosynephrine to maintain SBP>120 overnight. Neosynephrine
was slowly weaned in the morning, with concomitant
administration of IVF. Her hypotension was felt most likely
secondary to excess vagal stimulation post carotid [**Country **]
placement. She was asymptomatic, both at rest and on ambulation.


Imdur and Metoprolol were held both in hospital and at
discharge, and should be reintroduced as an out-patient.
Emphasis should also be placed on smoking cessation. Follow-up
appointments were arranged with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 7047**], Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] and Dr.
[**First Name (STitle) **]. A follow-up carotid ultrasound was also scheduled in a
month (patient enrolled in CAPTURE trial).

2) CAD: Cardiac catheterization revealed no flow limiting CAD on
angiography. She was continued on ASA, Plavix, and Lipitor. As
mentionned above, Metoprolol and Imdur were held in hospital
given her relative hypotension, and should be reintroduced as an
out-patient. Please emphasize smoking cessation.

3) COPD: No acute issues in hospital. She was continued on
Combivent prn.
