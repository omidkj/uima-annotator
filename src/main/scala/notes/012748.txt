IMAGING:
--------------------
CT TORSO [**2136-5-9**]
CT THORAX: Thyroid gland is unremarkable in appearance. Heart is
normal in
size. There is no pericardial effusion. The abdominal aorta has
a normal
course and caliber. Pulmonary vasculature is within normal
limits. No
enlarged hilar, mediastinal or axillary lymph nodes are
identified.
Airways are patent. Lungs are clear. There is mild atelectasis
at the right lung base. No pleural effusions. Of note, there is
heterogeneous enhancement of the breast tissue, with areas of
tiny nodular enhancement, bilaterally.
CT ABDOMEN: The liver is homogeneous in contrast enhancement
without abnormal enhancing mass identified. There is no
intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation. Portal and hepatic veins
are patent. Spleen, gallbladder, pancreas, and adrenal glands
are unremarkable in
appearance. Kidneys demonstrate prompt and symmetric uptake and
excretion of contrast. The visualized bowel is unremarkable in
appearance without bowel wall thickening, inflammatory changes
or obstruction. The abdominal aorta has a normal course and
caliber. No enlarged intraperitoneal, retroperitoneal or
mesenteric lymph nodes are identified.
CT PELVIS: Bowel loops are unremarkable in appearance. Uterus
and ovaries
are visualized. There is a nabothian cyst. No free fluid within
the pelvis. No enlarged pelvic lymph nodes are identified. There
is large destructive lesion eroding the T1 vertebral body and
right pedicle. There is a soft tissue mass associated with this
which is extending posteriorly into the cervical canal resulting
in superior and leftward displacement of the thecal sac. This
mass extends into the right neural foramen. No other osseous
lesions are identified.
IMPRESSION:
1. Large soft tissue mass eroding the entire T1 vertebral body
and extending posteriorly into the central canal with posterior
and leftward displacement of the thecal sac and complete
effacement of the right neural foramen.
2. No other osseous lesions or metastasis within the chest,
abdomen or
pelvis.
3. Heterogeneous nodular enhancement of the breast tissue
bilaterally.
multifocal DCIS [**Last Name (un) 5798**] to be excluded and correlation with
mammogram is
recommended, especially in the setting of a lytic osseous
lesion.

[**2136-5-12**] CT C-spine
1. Expected post-operative findings, immediately status post T1
corpectomy.
2. Overall alignment maintained.
3. Continued extensive bone destruction of the right pedicle and
lamina of
the T1 vertebral body with associated soft tissue density,
better-evaluated very recent (MetroNorth MRI) non-enhanced MRI
of [**2136-5-7**].

[**2136-5-16**] CT C-spine
Interval posterior spinal fusion from C4-T3 without immediate
hardware complication. Unchanged anterior spinal fusion at
C6-T1.

[**2136-5-20**] CT C-spine prelim
IMPRESSION:
Unchanged postop appearance of cervical and thoracic spine with
no fractures noted. The imaging extends down from the
craniocervical junction down to T8 vertebral body.
NOTE ADDED AT ATTNEDING REVIEW: I agree with the above
interpretation, but
note that the artifacts arising from fusion hardware obscure
nearly all
intraspinal soft tissue detail at the surgical levels. There is
no evidence of hardware loosening or fracture.




Brief Hospital Course:
Patient was admitted from NSURG office for further evaluation of
newly identified T1 lesion.  Upon admission, she was placed in a
cervical collar, and CT torso obtained to evaluate for alternate
solid mass disease. This was grossly unremarkable. Mammogram was
also obtained of the bilateral breasts on [**5-10**] to evaluate for
possible lesions. This was negative for any malignancy.

Cardiothoracic surgery was consulted for possibility of
providing exposure of T1 body anteriorly, but it was decided
that it was not necessary, and neurosurgery performed the
procedure independently.

On [**5-11**], Ms. [**Known lastname 14129**] went to the OR for T1 and T2 corpectomies.
She tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to the ICU
to recover.  Her neurological exam remained stable, in fact
slightly improved, and her pain was well controlled as well. She
was transferred out of the unit to the floor on [**5-12**].

The patient continued to have weakness in the intrinsic muscles
on the RUE as well as numbness in the last 2 digits in that
hand. She had some difficulty swallowing and was placed on a
modified diet. She had a swallowing evaluation and they agreed
with the modified diet.

On [**5-16**] the patient went back to the OR for stage II of her
procedure, which was a posterior fusion from C5-T3. She
tolerated the procedure well and a hemovac drain was placed.
This remained in until [**5-18**].  She was out of bed with PT and
ambulated well.  Her pain was well controlled on a MSO4 PCA,
which was weaned off to PO on [**5-18**].

She was ambulating well and voiding and doing well with a
regular diet. She developed a new LUE numbness at her forearm
and 5th digit. CT imaging was unchnaged.

She was on a bowel regimen for constipation buthad flatus.

She was discharged to home on [**5-22**], with follow up arranged for
[**Hospital3 328**] the same day.
