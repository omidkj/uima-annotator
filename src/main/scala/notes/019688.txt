History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 2418**] is a 58 Male with cerebral palsy and mental
retardation with a chief complaint of abdominal pain of 1 week's
duration.  He was last well 1 week ago, when nurses at his care
facility noticed he was complaining of abdominal pain.  The pain
seemed to be diffuse in nature, constant, sharp, and not
alleviated or exacerbated by anything.  He has a decade-long
history of chronic constipation, for which he requires daily
laxatives, and had not had a bowel movement for 5 days prior to
admission.   He did not have any fever, vomiting, rectal
bleeding, or decreased appetite.  The pain persisted until the
day of admission, when his nurse noticed that he was "not
himself," his abdomen was more distended and tense, and he was
found to be hypotensive to 74/52 and tachycardic to the 110s.
At this time he was brought to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED.

[**7-19**] CXR:FINDINGS: Cardiomediastinal contours are unremarkable,
and unchanged. Pulmonary vasculature is not enlarged, and there
is no evidence of CHF. Lung volumes are low, but there is no
focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax.

Massive colonic distention, particularly in the right upper
abdomen, is increased, even from baseline distention on multiple
studies dating back to [**2198-8-14**]. Resulting elevation of the
right hemidiaphragm is unchanged. There is no definite evidence
of free intraperitoneal air, although CT would be more sensitive
for evaluation.

IMPRESSION:

1. No definite evidence of free intraperitoneal air, although CT
would be more sensitive for evaluation.
2. Massive colonic distention, increased even from baseline
distention of multiple prior studies.

Brief Hospital Course:
On presentation Mr. [**Known lastname 2418**] was tachycardic and hypotensive to
SBP in the 60s, so was resuscitated in the ED with fluids and 2
units of blood.  His chest Xray and CT scan were consistent with
a diagnosis of colonic volvulus, and as he had peritoneal signs,
his lactate was 6.9, and WBCs were 40, the decision was made to
take him to the OR emergently.  Total abdominal colectomy with
end ileostomy and gastric tube insertion was performed by Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **].  See operative report dictated [**7-19**] for details of the
procedure.
Postoperatively Mr. [**Known lastname 2418**] was re-intubated for respiratory
distress and admitted to the ICU on fentanyl and propofol drips
for sedation, as well as neosynephrine for pressure control.
The sedatives and neosynephrine were weaned off by POD 3, and he
was started on tube feeds.  On POD4, he underwent an extubation
trial, but had respiratory distress once again on POD5.  Chest
Xray demonstrated bilateral effusions; a CT angiogram was
performed and was negative for PE.  At this time a flexible
bronchoscopy was performed and a large amount of thick mucus was
evacuated from his airways.  Sputum was sent for culture and
grew MRSA and Proteus.  He was started on Zosyn and Vancomycin
IV.
On POD 6 he once again had respiratory distress, and a repeat
chest Xray showed collapse of the left lung.  He also had a
brief episode of atrial fibrillation, which converted on an
amiodarone drip.  Bronchoscopy was repeated, and a large mucus
plug was removed from his left main bronchus.
On POD 7 a cosyntropin stimulation test was performed, and he
was found to have low baseline cortisol levels, so was started
on stress steroids.
On POD 8, he was extubated once again and this time remained
extubated.
On POD 10, Mr. [**Known lastname 22359**] central line was DC'd, peripheral IV
access attained, and he was transferred to the floor.  Speech
and swallow study was performed and he was started on his usual
soft diet with thin liquids on POD11.  Also on POD11, a PICC
line was placed in anticipation of his discharge with IV
antibiotics.
By POD 13, his PO intake had improved and he was breathing fine
on room air.  He was seen by physical therapy, which recommended
rehab services prior to returning to his group home.  The
decision was made to discharge him to an extended care facility
for rehab on [**2199-8-2**]
