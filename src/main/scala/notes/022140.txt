Chief Complaint:
Left leg pain and swelling

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
Pt is a 53yoM w/ h/o SMA thrombosis s/p partial small bowel
resection, possible protein C deficiency, asthma and
hemochromatosis who presents with a 4 day history of persistent
L leg pain and swelling. The patient has also experienced of
some SOB, exacerbated with activity, and development of a
nonproductive cough over the past few days as well associated
with his leg pain.  He denies pleuritic chest pain, wheezing,
fever, and n/v. Denies recent travel. He quit smoking two weeks
ago (not due to shortness of breath).



In the ED, initial VS were: 99.3 HR: 100 BP: 173/73 Resp: 20
O(2)Sat: 96 on RA.  However, the patient was reported to be
tachypneic, unable to speak in full sentences, and at one point
desatted to 88% on RA.  He responded well to 2L of O2.



Physical exam was notable for left leg with 2+edema.  Notable
labs included a proBNP of 1540, Trop-T <0.01, Hct 33.5, PT 13.2,
PTT 26.3, and INR of 1.2.  The patient also had a guaiac
negative stool.  Ultrasound down in the ED demonstrated deep
vein thrombosis of the left lower extremity venous system
extending from the calf veins (mid superficial femoral, distal
superficial femoral, popliteal, and calf veins) to the mid
superficial femoral vein.  The patient also received a CT of the
chest w/ and w/o contrast, and the preliminary read demonstrated
bilateral pulmonary emboli extending from the main pulmonary
artery at the level of the bifurcation into both the upper and
lower pulmonary arteries bilaterally.



EKG in the ED was unremarkable, and the patient received a
heparin bolus was started on a heparin drip.  He was also and
was transferred to the MICU given his significant clot burden.



On arrival to the MICU, the patient's vitals were 98.7  103
162/78  35  94% on 2L.



Of note, the patient received a work-up for a hypercoagulable
state by his PCP back in [**2175**] including tests for lupus
anticoagulant, antithrombin III, Protein C, anti-cardiolipin,
and Protein S of which Protein C studies returned borderline
positive. Patient received 6 months of Coumadin for his SMA
thrombosis.

[**2183-7-3**] CHEST CT:
FINDINGS:  Although this study is not tailored for assessment of

intra-abdominal organs, the visualized liver and spleen are
unremarkable.   The trachea is unremarkable and the airways are
patent to the subsegmental level.  There is no mediastinal,
axillary, or hilar lymphadenopathy.  Extensive coronary artery
calcifications are noted.  The right ventricle configuration is
similar to [**2175-5-20**]. The pericardium is unremarkable witout
thickening or effusion.  The esophagus is within normal limits
without evidence of hiatal hernia.   Lung window demonstrates
multiple spiculated opacities.  Most prominent are spiculated
opacities in the right apex (3:2), periphery of the right upper
lobe (3:9), and right lower lobe (3:37).  In the left lung, the
most conspicuous opacities are a spiculated opacity in the
superior segment of the left lower lobe (3:5).  There is no
pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
CTA:  The aorta is well opacified and is normal in caliber
throughout without evidence of dissection. There are bilateral
lobar pulmonary artery emboli.  In the right, pulmonary artery
embolus extends from the right pulmonary artery into both the
upper and lower lobar arteries, with almost complete occlusion
of the upper lobar branch and extending to the subsegmental
branches.  In the left, there is also an embolus straddling the
bifurcation of the left pulmonary artery extending into both the
superior and inferi
