Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2485**]
Chief Complaint:
transphenoidal brain biopsy

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
brain mass biopsy via sphenoidal sinus


History of Present Illness:
47F DM2, recently diagnosed metastatic adenoCA presents for
elective bx of brain mass. The mass is a "mass arising in the
center of the clivus and extending into the adjacent sphenoid
bones and petrous apices bilaterally" She underwent the surgery
today without post-operative complications. The procedure was a
trans-sphenoidal approach to the mass with muslitple biopsies
taken. The lesion was noted to erode through the sphenoid sinus
and into the nasoopharynx.
Per anesthesia resident, there was concern that the pt would be
a diffficult intubation given body habitus. The intubation was
able to be performed without fiberoptic guidance, although a
special blade was used and the resident commented that he pulled
"harder than I have ever had to pull before". He was concerned
that an urgent intubation would present difficulties. She was
intubated in the OR and was breathing comfortably looking well,
fully awake, alert, and oriented after arriving to the floor.

Head imaging revealed a Clivus mass. She was noted to have L
abducens palsy, neurologically otherwise intact. She was
