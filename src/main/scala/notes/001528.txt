History of Present Illness:
74 yr old female with hx of afib/flutter, tachy-brady syndrome
s/p [**First Name3 (LF) 4448**] in [**10/2168**], CHF (EF 20%), COPD s/p trach in [**8-/2168**]
who was sent to ED for evaluation of pacemker. In ED, EP
interrogated pacer and found that the pacer was functioning
properly. However, she was also found to have a fever to 101.4.
The pt was asymptomatic and is currently being treated with a
7-day course of augmentin for presumed sinusitis (given chronic
NGT) and UTI.
.
Also in [**Name (NI) **], pt was found to have different BP in each arm. A CT
of the chest was done to assess for subclavian vein stenosis but
it could not be assessed given the artifact from her pacer
wires.
.
On arrival to the ICU, pt's only complaint was a sore throat and
mild nausea. She denies chest pain, sob, vomiting, diarrhea, abd
pain, headache, dysuria, fevers or chills. She did not some
increased sputum from her trach tube.

CT Chest:
1. No evidence of central upper extremity vascular stenosis in
this limited study.
2. Multifocal air space opacities within the right and left
upper lobes, consistent with pneumonia. Mediastinal
lymphadenopathy is likely reactive.
3. Six millimeter nodular density within the right upper lobe.
3-month followup CT of the chest is recommended to ensure
stability and/or resolution.
4. Enlarged central pulmonary arteries, consistent with
underlying pulmonary arterial hypertension.
.
CT Sinus: Probable retention cysts with incompletely imaged
maxillary sinuses.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 74 yr old female with hx of afib/flutter, tachy-brady
syndrome s/p PCM, CHF, COPD s/p trach presents to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] with
fever, diagnosed with psuedomonas pneumonia
.
1. Fever: CT of the chest and CXR showed RUL opacity and sputum
from admission grew out pseudomonas, pan-sensitive, except for
ciprofloxacin.  Pt was given a dose of zosyn but developed hives
over her back and thighs so Zosyn was discontinued and she was
started on Aztreonam.  Urine, blood ans stol cultures were all
negative.  Given her chronic NGT a CT of the sinuses was done
and showed no signs of chronic sinusitis.  On day of discharge,
pt had been afebrile x 48 hours.  A PICC line was placed in
interventional radiology and pt should received 2 weeks of
Aztreonam for her pseudomonas pneumonia.
.
2. CHF: Pt has an EF of 20% on recent echo.  Due to some
episodes of hypotension, her BP meds were held and she required
fluid boluses.  Therefore, the pt remained positive during her
short hospital stay.  On day of discharge, pt was hypertensive
and was tolerating her BP meds.  She was started on
spironolactone and her hydralazine was stopped.  Her dose of
Lasix may need to be decreased due to the addition of
Spironolactone.  She was continued on metoprolol, lasix, ACE-I
and digoxin.  Her digoxin level was therapeutic.
.
3. Tachy-brady syndrome s/p PCM: EP interrogated pacer on
admission and found that her [**Hospital Unit Name 4448**] was working properly.
Her device clinic appointment was cancelled as EP has already
since the patient.
.
4. COPD: Pt on chronic vent support.  During her hospital stay,
pt was weaned and tolerated a pressure support trial of [**10-12**],
oxygenating well.  Her flovent and combivent were continued.
.
5. BP difference: Per family, this is old. Cannot assess
subclavian stenosis on CT due to pacer wires.
.
6. Lung Nodule: On chest CT, pt was found to have a 6mm nodular
density within the right upper lobe that will need to be
followed with another CT in 3 months.
.
7. Anxiety: Pt's seroquel was continued and she was started on
prn seroquel.
.
8. FEN: Speech and swallow evaluated the patient and she passed
the bedside swallow exam.  However, to further evaluate for
aspiration risk pt should have a video swallow.
.
8. Access: IR-placed PICC
.
9. Code: full
.
10. Ppx: SQ heparin.
