HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname 47717**] has been suffering
from orthostatic vertebrobasilar insufficiency and dizziness.
A cerebral angiogram revealed the presence of a significant
steal phenomenon resulting from shunting of the left
vertebral artery flow from the left vertebral to the
occipital artery resulting from a left external carotid
artery origin stenosis.  After discussion of risks and
benefits of angioplasty or surgery of the left internal
carotid artery, a decision was made to proceed with the
occlusion of the shunt in order to minimize the steal
phenomenon and improve profusion towards the posterior fossa.

discharge and have his INR checked.
