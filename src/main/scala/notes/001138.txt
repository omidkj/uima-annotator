HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient was a 58-year-old
man who was admitted to the Neurology Service on [**10-20**].
He initially presented to [**Hospital **] Hospital on [**10-18**] with
the acute onset of left-sided weakness.  A right
.................... hemorrhage was diagnosed by noncontrast
head CT.  While at [**Hospital **] Hospital, the patient fell, and
the thalamic hemorrhage expanded.  It was not clear whether
the hemorrhage resulted in the fall or the fall resulted in
expansion of the hemorrhage.  He was transferred to the [**Hospital1 **] [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] on [**2124-10-20**].

The initial exam documented that he was awake, obeying
commands, had a right gaze preference, and that he had left
arm ................... and face weakness.  He was witnessed
to have three generalized tonic clonic seizures on admission.
Ativan and Dilantin were started at that time.

Although it was felt that his hemorrhage was a typical
occasion for hypotensive bleed ...................., rapid
increase in size despite control of blood pressure and
increased right temporal edema suggested the possibility of
an AVM or dual sinus thrombosis.  Conventional angiogram as
normal.  The patient blood pressure was controlled with IV
drips in the unit, and Labetalol was discontinued on [**10-24**].  He did require intermittent Hydralazine and Lopressor
for blood pressure control.

His exam was fluctuating, but he had no overt seizures since
presentation.  For this reason, an EEG was obtained that
showed generalized background slowing.  While in the
Intensive Care Unit, the patient had an induced sputum which
showed gram-positive cocci.  He was treated initially with
Vancomycin and then with Oxacillin.  Mannitol was started on
[**10-24**] for the fear of increased intracranial edema, and
noncontrast head CT showed increased edema.  Mannitol was
discontinued the next day.

Since that time, the patient had reasonable control of his
blood pressure.  He has been transferred to the Neurology
Floor for further management.

ALLERGIES:  SULFA.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Unable to be obtained.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Unable to be obtained.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs:  The patient was
afebrile, blood pressure 132/68, heart rate 96, oxygen
saturation 100%.  General:  He appeared older than stated
age.  Difficult to arouse.  HEENT:  Dry mucous membranes.
Neck:  No thyromegaly or carotid bruits.  Pulmonary:  Coarse
breath sounds throughout.  Cardiovascular:  Atrial
fibrillation.  No murmurs.  Abdomen:  Soft and nontender.
Positive bowel sounds times four.  Extremities:  There were
1+ peripheral pulses.  No edema.  [**Month (only) **]:  He was
sleeping but aroused by name being called loudly.  He kept
his eyes open for a minute before falling back asleep.  He
did not attempt to communicate.  He blinks to threat.
Right-sided gaze preference.  Pupils equal and reactive.  He
had ................... strength in right hand.  He could
squeeze with good effort.  He moved right leg back and forth.
Left side was flaccid.  Toes upgoing in the left, and
downgoing in right.  Reflexes 3 in the upper extremities, 1+
at the patella, no ankle jerks.

LABORATORY DATA:  White count 13.5, hematocrit 35.5 platelet
count 220; sodium 140, potassium 3.7, chloride 110, bicarb
26, BUN 19, creatinine 0.5, glucose 141, calcium 8.0,
magnesium 1.8, phosphate 3.0.

Head CT showed a large right .................. hemorrhage.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  As noted above, the patient was initially
admitted to the Neurology [**Month (only) **].  After being transferred to
the Neurology floor on [**10-28**], he was continued on
Mannitol with an osmolality of 308.  The patient's mental
status did not improve on Mannitol.  His edema did not
resolve on CT.  He was therefore tried on an empiric course
of Decadron, a 10 mg bolus followed by 4 mg p.o. q.6 hours.

The patient's alertness improved on the Decadron, and
follow-up head CT demonstrated somewhat less edema with
decreased flattening of the ventricle.  The patient became
more alert, and the Decadron was tapered over two weeks.  The
patient's Oxacillin was discontinued after a ten-day course.
He has had no further issues with pneumonia.

The patient continue to make progress.  He was more alert,
although still not moving the left side of his body which has
remained hemiplegic.  He was not taking adequate oral intake,
so he was evaluated by Gastroenterology for placement of PEG
tube.  The PEG tube could not be placed because of his
ascites which was noted on ultrasound, and gastroesophageal
varices which was seen on EGD.

His current examination shows that he is awake and alert.  He
does not know the date but knows that he was in [**Hospital6 1760**].  His eye movements are full
to both sides.  His pupil are equal.  He has a left facial
droop, and his head was turned to the right.  He is
hemiplegic on the left side.  His toes are upgoing in the
left.

The patient will be discharged to rehabilitation on [**2124-11-21**].

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Right .................. hemorrhage.
2.  Hypertension.
3.  Portal hypertension complicated by varices.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  Lopressor 75 mg p.o. b.i.d., Colace
100 mg p.o. b.i.d., Paxil 20 mg p.o. q.d., Zantac 150 mg p.o.
b.i.d., Digoxin 0.25 mg p.o. q.d., Lactulose 30 cc p.o. q.6
hours, Nadolol 20 mg p.o. b.i.d.
