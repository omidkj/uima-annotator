History of Present Illness:
55 year old male with a PMH  of DM, pancreas/[**First Name3 (LF) **] transplants,
CAD s/p multiple stents, CHF with EF: 50-55%, Hep B/C admitted
[**9-5**] c/o abdominal pain and increased SOB for one week. The pain
was described as being sharp and increasing with movement. +
chills, +low grad fevers.  HE stated he was in his usual state
of health until 3-4 days prior to admission when he began to get
more SOB with increasing orthopnea and four pound weight gain.
He denies any recent medicine changes, follwed by [**Doctor Last Name 2031**] as
outpatient. During hospitalizations here, given Lasix IV causing
his CR to increase and urine output only -400 net. CHF service
consulted as only one kidney now and cr was rising with Lasix.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] recommended enrolling in Nesiritide/ CHF filtration
trial. Patient's abd pain w/u includd negative KUB and thought
likely secondary to CHF. ID/ transplant following during the
admission.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 55 year old male with extensive PMH of DMI, s/p pancreas
and [**Month/Day (4) **] transplant (CRT x 2), CAD s/p multiple percutaneous
interventions, CHF, and recent takedown of Hartmann's pouch
admitted with CHF exacerbation and abdominal pain.

1. CHF- The patient's increasing dyspnea was felt to be due to a
CHF exacerbation. The patient was originally to undergo
ultrafiltration however a tunneled line could not be placed at
the bedside. He was admitted to the CCU for niseritide with
modest response and then transferred to the floor on a lasix
infusion. His weight did not drop on the lasix drip at which and
he was felt to be persistently volume overloaded. The patient
subsequently underwent a tunneled line placement in the left IJ
by IR and was started on ultrafiltration. He underent several
sessions of UF while in house with removal of [**1-2**] liters with
each session.  The patient tolerated this procedure well
although his creatinine did bump from his basline to
approximately 3.0. He will be discharged on lasix 50 mg po bid
and will receive 3 sessions of UF per week as an outpatient. In
addition, he will remain on his beta blocker and low dose
hydralazine was added.

2. Abdominal pain- The patient initially had abdmominal pain of
unclear etiology. Significantly, the patient had abdominal
cellulitis last month but the incisional area does not appear
infected on exam. No fluid collection in that area was seen on
ultrasound. LFTs were within normal limits except for an
elevated alkaline phosphatase and elevated GGT. The patient's
abdominal US was nonrevealing except for mildly elevated flow
pressures in the transplanted kidney but these were stable
compared to a prior exam. Plan films of the abdomen were
negative for SBO. We discussed CT of the abdomen with the
patient however he was unwilling to drink contrast and this was
not pursued. The most probable cause of abdominal pain was felt
to be hepatic congestion from fluid overload and mesenteric
edema. Transplant surgery was consulted and did not find the
patient to have any acute surgical issues.

The patient also complained of diarrhea. C. diff was negative x
3. A CMV viral load was negative. The patient admitted to eating
many sugar free, sorbitol containing hard candies. When these
were discontinued, his diarrhea resolved.

3. ESRD s/p [**Date Range **] transplant- The patient's creatinine was at
baseline on admission and his transplanted kidney was unchanged
on US from previous studies. His creatinine did bump with
diuresis and initiation of ultrafiltration; however, this did
not represent a significant loss of GFR. He was continued on
prednisone and imuran for immunosuppression. A PTH was also
checked and was elevated. He was started on calcitriol for this.
