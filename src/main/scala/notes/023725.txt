days and represents with cough and shortness of breath.  On
initial ED visit,  she had peak flow 375 and was discharged home
from the ED w/ prescription for prednisone, but ??????never got

infrequently required oral steroids.  She does not recall her
baseline peak flow.  She denies aspirin sensitivity.
.
In the ED, VS:  98.3 123 122/46 18 100%.  Her initial peak flow
was 460 by EMS then later 250 in ED.  She received Albuterol
nebs, 1L NS IV, Solumedrol 125mg IV, Mg Sulfate 4g IV,
Codeine/Guaifenesin 20mg PO,  Ativan 1mg,  Ipratropium neb x 4.

IMAGING:
[**2182-10-7**]:
FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**10-4**], there is little
interval
change and no evidence of acute cardiopulmonary disease. No
pneumonia,
vascular congestion, or pleural effusion.


Brief Hospital Course:
A/P:
22yr old female with history of asthma (has been hospitalized in
the past but never intubated), subclinical hypothyroidism,
recently presented to ED on [**10-4**] w/ cough and subjective fevers
and represents with cough and sob, reduced peak flow, c/w asthma
exacerbation.
.
#Asthma Exacerbation:   Moderate to severe episode w/ PEFR <50%
of expected, .  Maintaining good sats currently.  No CO2
retention on ABG.  Likely precipitant is upper respiratory tract
infection, although additional irritant of smoking likely
contributory.  Pt was treated with albuterol nebs, ipratroprium
nebs, Prednisone 60mg PO Daily and ativan 0.5mg IV:PRN for
anxiety.  Pt had intermittent coughing spells where she had a
deep, harsh, long cough that was concerning for pertussis.
Pertussis culture/serology, Influenza A/B, Rapid Viral screen
and culture were sent and were pending at the time of discharge.
 She steadily improved over the course of her ICU stay and on
day 3 of admission the patient was ready for discharge with
prednisone 60mg PO daily for 4 more days.  pt best peak flow
during admission was 350.
.
#Cough:  Afebrile, elevated WBC (likely secondary to steroids),
previous clear CXR on prev ED visit.  No clear pulmonary
process, but concern for pertussis given severity of cough,
however no known exposures, no recent travel hx, and no true
paroxysms witnessed.  More likely cold virus, less likely flu
(given time course), although not vaccinated.  Would benefit
from cough suppression due to the violent nature of her cough.
Pt sent home with cough suppresant and medication control for
her asthma.  She needs close follow up for better asthma
control.
.
Elevated WBC: pt elevated WBC was elevated on this admission
likely [**12-25**] steroid use.  however, pt had elevated WBC on [**10-4**]
and it is unclear whether that level was prior to steroid
administration.  Pt would benefit from follow up of her WBC
after she completes her dose of steroids prescribed for this
acute exacerbation.
.
#Smoking Cessation:  Pt admits to smoking frequently, but
appears to be minimizing.  Discussed smoking cessation.  Pt has
no interest in nicotine patch, but has intention to quit in the
future.  Pt would greatly benefit from smoking cessation as she
was admitted to the ICU for asthma exacerbation.
.
#Anemia: Pt had normocytic anemia.  Anemia labs all normal, but
ferritin on the low side for a patient with an inflammatory
reaction.  possible iron deficiency anemia secondary to blood
loss from menstrual periods.  This issue was not actively worked
up and seems new as her hg/hct prior to [**10-7**] were normal.
Further work-up for her anemia would be appreciated.
.
#Hypothyroidism:  TSH normal.  subclinical, dx of Hashimoto??????s
thyroiditis.  ? effect on lower extremity weakness, no
significant deficit on exam.  we continued her levothyroxine.
TSH was normal.  Patient has been seen by endocrine and notes
are in the computer.
.
#Sinus Tachycardia: Anxiety vs Dehydration (pt not eaten all
day).  Denies pain.  TSH was normal at 0.31.  Heart Rate was
well controlled with control of respiratory symptoms as well as
low dose ativan.  The patients hear rate slowly trended down as
her symptoms improved and inxiety decreased.
.
Patient had been doing well on day of discharge and ashtma
exacerbation had significantly improved.  She was discharged
with close follow up in outpatient clinic as she has no PCP
