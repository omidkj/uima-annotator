Chief Complaint:
Left sided plegia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**11-8**] brain biopsy

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 51 y/o male in previously good health until
approximately 2 weeks prior to admission. While down in [**Location (un) 80056**] in [**Month (only) 216**] visiting his children when he developed some
left sided-weakness and numbness.  He underwent a brain biopsy
at a [**Hospital 5170**] hospital on [**2147-10-5**] which revealed a preliminary
DX of grade II Astrocytoma. The pt was then transferred to an
[**Hospital 26110**] rehab facility  via Medivac (due to the hurricane) on
[**2147-10-8**]. He subsequently was  discharged on [**2147-10-14**].  From there
he while traveling to [**Location (un) 86**], MA he developed acute shortness of
breath on [**2147-10-14**], Upon landinghe was taken to an outside ED and
later transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]  where he was intubated for airway
protection and dyspnea. He was found to have a small PE. While
in [**Hospital1 18**] ED his neurologic status and exam deteriorated.  He
became more lethargic, not following commands, and without
spontaneous speech. Physical exam revealed a dense left
hemiplegia.

 Interpretation
 --------------
The oligoclonal band assay detected 3 or less IgG bands in the
CSF,
which are not present in the serum.
This is a Negative result.

EKG([**10-14**]):
Sinus bradycardia. Early repolarization. No previous tracing
available for
comparison.

BIOPSY: Brain, frontal lobe, right, biopsy:  Subcortical white
matter with sharply demarcated zones of demyelination.  See
note.  Note: Luxol fast blue and Bodian stains show sharply
demarcated areas of demyelination with preserved axons.
Immunohistochemical stains for CD68 and CD3 show dense
infiltration of macrophages and scattered T cells in areas of
demyelination.  Immunostain for SV40 ([**Male First Name (un) 2326**] virus) is negative.
These findings are consistent with multiple sclerosis in the
appropriate clinical context.

Imaging:
CTA Chest([**10-15**]):
IMPRESSION: Small peripheral pulmonary embolus within the right
lower lobe.

Head CT([**10-15**]):
IMPRESSION: Extensive edema of the hemispheres, with involvement
of the
corpus callosum, compatible with the reported history of
glioblastoma
multiforme.

LE Ultrasound ([**10-15**]):
IMPRESSION: No evidence of lower extremity DVT.

MRI Head ([**10-15**]):
IMPRESSION:
1. Extensive bifrontal vasogenic edema with two small foci of
enhancement.
Findings are nonspecific and may correspond to the reportedly
biopsy-proven glioblastoma multiforme. Given the overall paucity
of enhancement, hemorrhage or necrosis, however, lymphoma
remains a distinct possibility.
2. Small amount of blood products along the right frontal lobe
biopsy tract.
3. Unusual pattern of non-enhancing uniform T1- and
T2-hyperintensity
confined to the right basal ganglia, of unclear etiology, but
likely secondary to the adjacent extensive tumor and peritumoral
edema, perhaps on the basis of altered perfusion (though there
is no evidence of frank infarction); a less likely consideration
is direct tumor infiltration.
COMMENT: Focused MRI with spectrscopy, arterial-spin label
perfusion, and
dynamic susceptibility perfusion analysis has been recommended,
to better
characterize both the primary process and the findings in the
ipsilateral
basal ganglia.

MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 430**]([**10-19**]):
Redemonstration of extensive bifrontal edema infiltrating the
corpus callosum, with small areas of posterior enhancement.
Overall, the
appearance favors glioblastoma over lymphoma, although
encephalitis can have the same imaging appearance. Correlation
