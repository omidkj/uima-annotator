EGD ([**2142-7-12**])
Impression: Granularity, erythema and abnormal vascularity in
the fundus and antrum compatible with gastritis / portal
hypertensive gastropathy
Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum

Brief Hospital Course:
As there was concern for an upper GI bleed, the hepatology team
felt an EGD within the first 12 hours of reported bleed for a
possible variceal source was an important intervention.  As
such, the patient was admitted to the medical ICU. Anesthesia
was called to assess the patient, as a propofol drip was
required (fentanyl and versed could not be used given the
patient's use of suboxone and HAART therapies).  Mr. [**Known lastname 27003**] was
kept NPO for the procedure, and received an octreotide drip and
IV PPI [**Hospital1 **] prior to the scope.  The patient was noted to have
mild gastritis on EGD with no source of bleeding.  After the
procedure, he was restarted on his home medications, his IV PPI
was converted to PO, and his octreotide drip was stopped.  He
was started on a clear liquid diet, which was advanced to a
regular diet with carb control and low sodium.  He was then
monitored overnight in the ICU and remained hemodynamically
stable.

Dr.[**Name (NI) 948**] office will set up a follow up appointment for Mr.
[**Known lastname 27003**] after his discharge.  He will require a colonoscopy as an
outpatient
