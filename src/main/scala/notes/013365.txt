Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 290**]
Chief Complaint:
g-tube fell out

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Replacement of G-tube.


History of Present Illness:
64F nonverbal at baseline, recently discharged after a
hospitalization for UTI with Sepsis who was initially sent in
from her [**Hospital1 1501**] for simple G tube replacement, which was found to
be out at 6PM. On arrival found to be tachycardic, T 100.4, PR
tylenol given. Recently admitted for sepsis.
.
In the ED inital vitals were, 98.4 86 126/76 18 97%, multiple
attempts to place a foley in her G-Tube track failed, and per
report the patient was noted to become tachycardic. Her
temperature was then noted to rise to 100.4 and she received PR
tylenol. Throughout the course of the night her BPs began to
dwindle down. Her IV access was a single peripheral 22G IV, and
thus a RIJ was placed. After 2L IVF her BPs increased to the
130's systolic. Given her recent history of VRE UTIs, and
current impressive pyuria she was given IV linezolid and ctx in
the ED. She never required pressors.
.
Of note, a note from her most recent hospitalization revealed
that her HCP is leaning towards DNR/DNI and hospice care.
.
On the floor, she appears well, she is afebrile with otherwise
normal vitals.
.

                            **FINAL REPORT [**2174-12-8**]**

   URINE CULTURE (Final [**2174-12-8**]):
      MIXED BACTERIAL FLORA ( >= 3 COLONY TYPES), CONSISTENT
WITH SKIN
      AND/OR GENITAL CONTAMINATION.

BLOOD CULTURES: NGTD x 2

CXR [**12-7**]: Right IJ catheter in proximal SVC. No pneumothorax.
CXR [**12-7**]: Right lower lobe pneumonia.

Brief Hospital Course:
64F with MMP presented to the hospital because G-tube fell out,
found to have hypotension and fever concerning for sepsis.

ACTIVE ISSUES:

# sepsis/hypotension:  blood cultures still pending so unsure if
pt was truly septic or if she was hypotensive for other reasons.
 Pt was febrile on admission and had also lost G-tube access and
so had poor po intake prior to admission.  Hypotension could be
multifactorial secondary to volume depletion, febrile
vasodilatation, or infection.  U/A was dirty on admission and pt
has chronic foley placement.  However, UCx was negative.  Also
found to have right lower lobe infiltrate on CXR concerning for
pneumonia.  Gave pt tylenol and 2 liters of fluid rescucitation
in ED.  Hypotension and fevers subsequently resolved and she was
normotensive and afebrile by the time she reached MICU floor and
remained so throughout hospital course.  Treated pt empirically
initially with linezolid/cefepime/tobra because of her history
of resistant UTIs.  However, palliative care was consulted and
confirmed that patient had been made DNR/DNI in the past with
comfort measures only and plan was to only return to hospital
for g-tube replacement.  Therefore, IV antibiotics were stopped
and pt was given prescription for oral cefpodoxime for total 5
day course to treat infection with plans to not treat or
hospitalize should infection recur.

# nutrition/G-tube - replaced G-tube by IR while in house and
resumed tube feeds and po meds.

# comfort care: Per above, pt is comfort measures only with no
plans for further hospitalization.  Adjusted patient's home
medications upon discharge as follows: stopped simvastatin for
CAD/HLD; stopped heparin for DVT ppx; stopped Vit. C,
multivitamin, and Vit. D; stopped Amlodipine and Lisinopril for
hypertension; stopped [**Month/Day (2) **] for infection prophylaxis

INACTIVE ISSUES:

#  Seizure d/o - gave home seizure meds by IV while awaiting
g-tube replacement.  After placement, switched back to po meds.
Will continue for comfort.

# diabetes: continued pt on SSI.  will continue insulin glargine
and insulin lispro as outpatient

# COPD: continued ipratropium, albuterol nebs
