Pertinent Results:
PRE-BYPASS:
1. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
2. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).

3. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal.
4. The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. The
ascending aorta is moderately dilated. There are simple atheroma
in the descending thoracic aorta.
5. The aortic valve is bicuspid. The aortic valve leaflets are
moderately thickened. There is mild aortic valve stenosis (valve
area 1.2-1.9cm2). No aortic regurgitation is seen.
6. Physiologic mitral regurgitation is seen (within normal
limits).
7. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
POST-BYPASS: For the post-bypass study, the patient was
receiving vasoactive infusions including phenylephrine
1. A well-seated bioprosthetic valve is seen in the aortic
position with normal leaflet motion and gradients (mean gradient
= 5 mmHg). No aortic regurgitation is seen.
2. Biventricular function is normal.
3. Aorta is intact post decannulation
4. Other findings are unchanged

Final Report
REASON FOR EXAMINATION: Followup of a patient after chest tube
removal for
evaluation of pneumothorax.

PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in
comparison to [**6-27**], [**2103**] study obtained at 00:22 a.m.

The patient was extubated in the meantime interval with removal
of the
Swan-Ganz catheter, mediastinal drains and ET tube. The
cardiomediastinal
silhouette is stable. Bibasilar atelectasis are present,
involving a
relatively small amount of the lung parenchyma. There is no
evidence of
pneumothorax. There is no appreciable pleural effusion
demonstrated.
Anterior mediastinal air is most likely related to recent
surgery.

[**6-26**] Mr.[**Known lastname 43950**] was taken to the operating room and underwent
Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting x 5 (left internal mammary
artery grafted to left anterior descending artery/Saphenous vein
grafted to Diagnal/Obtuse Marginal/Post. Desc.artery/PLV)/Aortic
Valve Replacement (#29mm [**Company 1543**] Porcine Valve). Please refer
to Dr[**Last Name (STitle) 5305**] operative report for further details. He
tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to the CVICU in
critical but stable condition. He awoke neurologically intact
and was extubated without difficulty. All lines and drains were
discontinued in a timely fashion. Beta-blocker and diuresis was
initiated. POD#1 Mr.[**Known lastname 43950**] was transferred to the step down
unit for further monitoring. Physical Therapy consulted and
evaluated him. The remainder of his postoperative course was
essentially uneventful and on POD# 4 he was cleared for
discharge to home with VNA. All follow up appointments were
