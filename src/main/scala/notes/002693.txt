HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This 47 year old morbidly obese
white male with multiple medical problems was recently
discharged from [**Hospital6 256**] on
[**2155-9-1**] after a 50 day hospital course for
endocarditis with panresistant Klebsiella and coagulase
negative Staphylococcus bacteremia on multiple antibiotic
regimens.  He was transferred to rehabilitation and was not
happy with the rehabilitation and returned and was
readmitted.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  His past medical history is
significant for a history of morbid obesity, a history of
adult onset diabetes, history of prostate carcinoma, status

was complicated by multiple wound infections and he currently
has a large decubitus, history of hypercholesterolemia,
history of hypertension, history of depression and anxiety,
history of endocarditis with an aortic valve vegetation,
panresistant Klebsiella bacteremia and coagulase negative
Staphylococcus bacteremia, history of baseline confusion,
history of right hand decrease movement.  He had an
echocardiogram on [**2155-8-4**] which revealed an ejection
fraction of greater than 55%, 3+ aortic regurgitation and 2+
mitral regurgitation and cardiac catheterization on [**2155-7-23**] revealed clean coronaries.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Metoprolol 50 mg p.o. b.i.d.,

for ten years and quit five years ago.  He does not drink
alcohol.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Unremarkable.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Significant for hematochezia found to be
from antibiotics for wound infection after prostate surgery,
chest pain and palpitations.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On physical examination his
temperature maximum is 96.9, blood pressure 111/54, heartrate
100, respirations 20, oxygen saturation 100%.  General:  He
is a morbidly obese white male, uncomfortable, appears in
distress, noncompliant.  Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat
examination, normocephalic, atraumatic, extraocular movements
intact, oropharynx benign.  Neck:  Supple, full range of
motion, no thyromegaly or lymphadenopathy.  No jugulovenous
distension.  Carotids 2+ and equal bilaterally without
bruits.  Lungs were clear to auscultation and percussion.
Cardiovascular examination:  Distant heartsounds.  Regular
rate and rhythm.  Normal S1 and S2 with no rubs, murmurs or
gallops.  Abdomen was obese.  Gastrostomy tube in place.
Normal bowel sounds, soft, nontender with no masses or
hepatosplenomegaly.  Extremities:  Nonpitting edema in
bilateral lower extremities and right upper extremity edema.
Neurological examination:  He was alert and oriented times
three.  Cranial nerves were intact.  Bilateral lower
extremities had 4/5 strength.  Right upper extremity, moved
fingers and sensation intact.

LABORATORY DATA:  Laboratory data on admission revealed
hematocrit 27, white count 14,300, platelets 410,000, sodium
138, potassium 3.7, chloride 101, carbon dioxide 25, BUN 18,
creatinine 0.6, blood sugar 104.  He had a head computerized
tomography scan which was negative.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  He was admitted to the medical floor and
was continued on his antibiotics.  He also had a large
decubitus which was being treated with Duoderm.  He continued
to have positive blood cultures and he also had a trach in
place and was using Passy-Muir valve.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1537**] was
reconsulted, he had seen him previously and he was evaluated
by Neurology who felt that they had limited treatment options
at this time and felt that he needed his valve fixed prior to
further workup.  On [**9-15**], the patient underwent a
mitral valve replacement with a #27 Porcine mitral valve
replacement and a #23 pericardial mitral valve replacement.
He also had his tracheostomy removed at that time and was
nasotracheally intubated.  He was transferred to the Cardiac
Surgery Recovery Unit on insulin, Levophed, Milrinone and
Propofol.  He had a stable postoperative night.  He had a
bronchoscopy for thick secretions on postoperative day #1.
He was continued on Vancomycin and Ampicillin and
Levofloxacin.  He was eventually slowly weaned off of his
Milrinone.  He had his chest tube discontinued on
postoperative day #2.  He was eventually weaned off of his
Levophed as well and he was followed by Infectious Disease
who recommended discontinuing his Ampicillin on day #3.  The
pathology of his valve revealed dead bacteria, it did not
grow anything and it was from his prior Enterobacter
endocarditis. He was restarted on his tube feeds.  He was
heparinized to prevent deep vein thromboses.  He was then
started on Zosyn on postoperative day #5.  He did grow out
Klebsiella from his sputum and he had coagulase negative
Staphylococcus on the line tip.  He was unable to wean from
the ventilator and on postoperative day #8 he went back to be
retrached, tolerated the procedure well and continued to
slowly improve.  He was weaned off of the Milrinone on
postoperative day #12 and he was aggressively diuresed
throughout this time.  He did go into atrial fibrillation at
that point.  His Lopressor was increased and he was started
on Amiodarone and he converted to sinus rhythm.  He was
weaned off of the ventilator on postoperative day #13 and he
had a swallowing evaluation on postoperative day #16 and
passed with thin liquids, food and could tolerate everything.
 He was continued on his tube feeds but started eating.  On
postoperative day #16 he was noted to have his right shoulder
dislocated, this had been going on for a few days according
to the patient.  He had shoulder films and was evaluated by
Orthopedics and they are repeating the films and will decide
on the treatment for that tomorrow.  They will try to reduce
it, if it truly is dislocated and then he will probably need
a sling after that. On postoperative day #17 he was
discharged to rehabilitation in stable condition.

His laboratory data on discharge revealed white count 15,100,
hematocrit 37.7, platelets 429.  Sodium 141, potassium 4,
chloride 95, carbon dioxide 32, BUN 43, creatinine 0.9, and
blood sugar 169.
