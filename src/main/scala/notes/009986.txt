History of Present Illness:
74 y/o female with PMH significant for COPD, CAD, and
hypertension admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**6-14**] to the surgery service
with two days of epigastric and right upper quadrant pain. She
had also been febrile to 101 and had one episode of nausea and
vomiting. Per notes, her abdominal exam was significant for
epitastric and right upper quadrant tenderness; positive
gaurding; and no rebound. Pt was guiac negative. CT showed a
distended gallbladder with wall thickening and a small amount of
pericholecystic fluid. Common duct was dilated up to 11 mm and
the pancreatinc duct was prominent at 5 mm. No free air or
fluid. Significant atherosclerotic disease with occlusion of the
[**Female First Name (un) 899**] and possible celiac and renal artery stenosis.

[**6-14**] CT
1) Distended gallbladder with wall edema and possible
pericholecystic fluid. Intra and extrahepatic ductal dilatation
is noted as well as prominence of the pancreatic duct. Further
evaluation with ERCP or MRCP is recommended.
2) Significant atherosclerotic disease with occlusion of the [**Female First Name (un) 899**]
and possible celiac and renal artery stenosis. The patient's
abdominal pain could be related to intestinal angina. Further
evaluation can be obtained with mesenteric CTA.
3) No evidence of diverticulitis.
4) Stable left pleural effusion.
5) Stable right renal cyst.
6) Stable small low attenuation focus in the spleen, which is
too small to be characterized.
.
[**6-20**] CT
1. Cholecystostomy tube in good position with no evidence of
fluid collection around it.
2. Ostial calcifications with narrowing of the mesenteric
vessels with no evidence of bowel wall thickening, edema, or
fluid.
.
[**6-26**] CTA
1) No evidence of pulmonary embolus.
2) Marked interval increase in left-sided pleural effusion and
left lower lobe atelectasis. No evidence of central obstructing
lesion.
3) Unchanged appearance of pulmonary nodules; in the absence of
a known primary malignancy, one-year follow-up is recommended to
ensure stability.
4) Mild upper lobe emphysematous changes.

Brief Hospital Course:
Although it was felt that the pt had cholycytstitis, it was felt
that she was an extremely high risk surgical candidate given her
significant pulmonary and cardiac disease. Therefore, a
percutaneous cholecyst tube was placed on [**6-15**] instead of doing
a cholecystectomy. Following this, the pt had a good decreased
in her pain and her fevers decreased into the 99 range. Doing an
ERCP was considered but as the pt had normal LFTs and bili this
was deferred as there was a concern that it would require
intubation. On [**6-19**], the pt spiked to 101.2 and redeveloped
right upper quadrant tenderness. On [**6-20**], she developed an
acutely more distended abdomen associated with nausea. At that
time, she began to desatruate to 70% with associated tachypnea,
accesory muscle use, and tachycardia into the 130s. An ABG at
that time was 7.44/39/52. CXR showed minimal worsening of a left
lower lobe consolidation with prominent bilateral vascular
markings. At that time, the pt was transferred to the SICU for
closer monitoring.
.
In the SICU, her oxygen saturation initially increased to 90% on
4L NC. Following transfer, she spiked to 103.6 and was started
on vancomycin and zosyn for a left lower lobe PNA. She was also
started on steroids for her COPD component. LFTs remained within
normal limits and there continued to be good drainage from her
choly tube. Pt defervesced over the nex few days and her
oxygenation stablalized on 4 L NC with a sat in the high 90s and
RR in the high teens. Then, on the evening of [**6-25**], the pt
received 1 mg ativan and 4 mg morphine for anxiety then desatted
to 100% on a NRB. In addition, pt had a low blood sugar of 65
which was treated with 1/2 amp D50. ABG obtained at that time
showed 7.38/56/66. Pt also received an extra 40 mg of IV lasix.
This morning, after receiving her morning nebs, the pt reported
that she could not breath and her oxygen sat began to drop
quickly going from 95 to 65%. Pt was given another treatment and
her BiPAP settings were increased with an improvement in her
sat. However, she became more tachypnic, tachycardic, and was
using her accessory muscles to breath. Pulmonary saw the pt and
was concerned that this acute respiratory failure coud be
secondary to bronchospasm. The pt had been off of high dose
steroids for 24 hours. However, PE was the primary concern to
rule out given her acute hypoxia, tachycardia, and relative
hypotension. A CTA was negative for PE however demonstrated a
large pleural effusion.  At this time the patient's respiratory
status was quite tenuous requiring mask ventillation.
.
The effusion was tapped producing 1 L of transudative fluid
which was culture negative.  The patient's respiratory status
markedly improved and her oxygen requirements decreased to 4L
NC.  She was transferred to the floor where she felt much
better.  The patient had one desatturation to 89% on 3L on [**6-29**]
which quickly resolved with nebs.  Otherwise th
