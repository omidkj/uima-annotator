History of Present Illness:
56M with cirrhosis [**3-15**] Hepatitis C acquired from blood
transfusion, chronic thrombocytopenia on trial medication x 3
weeks, HTN admitted from ED with concerning findings on CXR of
B/L PTX and new left pleural effusion. Symptoms started 2 days
prior to admission with progressively worsening shortness of
breath followed by central/right sided pleuritic chest pain
associated with dry cough which started day PTA. CP constant,

Brief Hospital Course:
Brief Hospital Course By Problem:
 B/L PTX: Unclear etiology for new onset bilateral PTX given he
has had no recent pressure changes that would precipitate PTX
and no known risk factors for secondary PTX such as COPD, CF,
TB, ankylosing spondylitis, asthma, histiocytosis X, idiopathic
pulmonary fibrosis, lymphangioleiomyomatosis, lung cancer,
Marfan syndrome, necrotizing pneumonia, rheumatoid arthritis, or
sarcoidosis. Primary spontaneous PTX also possibility but he is
not of typical stature, or epidemiology. He has no previous
known underlying lung disease although likely had rupture of
subpleural bleb given mild bullous disease on chest CT which is
out of proportion to smoking history.  He has been on new
medication which stimulates megakaryocytes for thrombocytopenia
but PTX or cystic lung disease not obvious side effect. PTX
resolved with intervention, and were no longer visible on chest
x-ray done on [**2179-9-19**].  Given that we could not determine a cause
of his bilateral PTX's, patient was scheduled for follow up in
pulmonary clinic.

.
# Pleural effusion: Pt has chronic small right effusion likely
from known liver disease but has new moderate to large left
pleural effusion which has developed since [**7-/2179**], unclear if
related to new PTX.  Patient had thoracentesis done on [**2179-9-17**],
analysis of the pleural fluid, showed multiple WBC's and RBC's
but no organisms, cytology was negative for malignancy and
showed: reactive mesothelial cells, macrophages and neutrophils,
and the fluid was exudative by Lyte's criteria.  ID was
consulted who recommended observing the patient off antibiotics,
since he did not have any active signs of infection and to rule
him out for TB.  Off antibiotics the patient remained afebrile,
had a PPD placed, pleural fluid was sent for AFB and he was
ordered for induced sputum for AFB x 3.  However, when
respiratory came to induce sputum with hypertonic saline on
repeats occasions, they were only able to obtain one sample,
after conferring with ID it was decided that since he was low
risk
