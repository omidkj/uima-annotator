Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Dilantin Kapseal

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3256**]
Chief Complaint:
Nausea and Vomiting

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Fine needle aspiration of lymph node


History of Present Illness:
3 yo F w/ PMH of IgA nephropathy s/p failed cadaveric transplant
on HD via Left AV fistula, Afib/flutter (on coumadin), Diastolic
heart failure and hx of malignant hypertension p/w nausea and
vomiting x 3 days. Pt reports she was in her USOH when on [**10-3**]
she developed nausea vomiting, diarrhea 6-7x/day, and headache.
She reports she would start vomiting everytime she would try to
drink anything, and then would have diarrhea with incontinece.
She missed her dialysis yesterday and on day of admission felt
wek and dizzy and called EMS to bring her to the ED. On arrival
to the ED her initial vitals were 100.3, 125/61, 16, 97% RA. CXR
showed mild pulmonary edema and gave 1L bolus. And labs were
signficant for K=5.3, Lactate- 4.2, anion gap of 29, WBC 15.1
with 91.6%PMN and INR=3.3. Renal felt she needed urgent dialysis
to assist with hyperkalemia. She had a pneumonia with
respiratory failure and hyperkalemia in [**2-/2198**] where she was
intubated and treated with Vanc/Cefepime for 7 day course
without growth in cultures.
.
In dialysis, she did not have any ultrafiltrate as she was felt
to be below her dry weight. She was AAOx3 and conversant. She
was given tylenol and carvedilol and transferred to the floor.
.
On arrival to the floor her initial VS were 100.1, 176/80, 80,
30, 93%2L. She was difficult to arose, was oriented to person
and not answering questions, and no further history was able to
be obtained. Patient triggered 1 hour after arriving on the
floor, had an ABG which was signficant for 7.57/34/71/32,
showing a metabolic alkalosis, metabolic gap acidosis. Patient
was complaining of feeling hot and her temp was 102.4, she was
given 1g acetaminophen. After 1 hour her O2 sats improved to 98%
on 2L, and she was more coherent. And was able togive the
following additional history: Patient reports not taking her
coumdain x multiple days because unable to keep anything down.
She denies sick contacts aside from being in dialysis 3x/week.
She denies cough or rhinorrhea. she complains of headache that
is frontal with some right facial pain. No changes in vision, no
neck stiffness, no tick exposures and does not spend much time
outdoors.

.
EKG [**2198-10-6**]:
Regular bradycardic rhythm with possible P waves in the late QRS
complex or early ST segment. Intraventricular conduction delay.
Consider junctional or idioventricular rhythm. Leftward axis.
Intraventricular conduction delay of left bundle-branch block
type. Q-T interval prolongation. ST-T wave
abnormalities. Since the previous tracing atrial tachycardia or
atrial
fibrillation no longer present. The QRS width is now wider but
of similar
morphology. Clinical correlation is suggested.
.
Imaging:
CT chest without contrast [**10-14**]
IMPRESSION:
1. In view of clinical history and pattern of lung nodules
though septic
emboli is likely possibility, presence of L2 vertebral body
lytic lesion focal and focal lucency in D11 vertebra along with
enlarged mediastnal and
supraclavicular lymph nodes is concerning for metastatic disease
from
primary/lymphoma.
2. Bilateral moderate complex pleural effusions.
3. Bilateral atrophic kidneys with parenchymal calcification
suggestive of
chronic renal disease.
4. Dense mitral annulus calcification and minimal pericardial
effusion.
.
CTA head and neck with and without contrast [**10-14**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. Overall unremarkable cranial CTA with no finding to
specifically suggest mycotic aneurysm formation, though this
imaging modality may be insensitive for this diagnosis.
2. Congenitally hypoplastic left vertebral art
