Service:  VSU


CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Progressive calf claudication.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a patient who is well-
known to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1391**] and underwent an aortobifemoral bypass
graft in [**2175**] and has had recurrent symptoms of claudication
since [**2197**], which have progressed and have diminished her
ability to walk more than 20 feet. The patient now is
admitted for elective right leg revascularization.

ALLERGIES:  Penicillin and Procardia.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Amiodarone 100 mg daily; aspirin
325 mg daily; atenolol 25 mg daily; Lasix 20 mg q48 hours;
levothyroxine 75 mcg daily; Prilosec 20 mg daily; potassium
(K-Dur) 10 mEq every other day.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Illnesses:  Peripheral vascular
disease, status post aortobifemoral bypass graft in [**2175**];
history of dyslipidemia - on a statin; history of
dysrhythmia/atrial fibrillation, status post pacemaker
implantation; history of hypertension; history of ischemic
heart disease with a myocardial infarction in [**2198-3-31**];
history of arthritis and gout; history of thyroid disease -
supplemented; history of glucose tolerance impairment - not
under treatment; history of gastric reflux - on omeprazole
and asymptomatic; history of pancreatitis - remote; history
of chronic renal disease; history of oral cancer, status post
right palate excision in [**2183**]; history of glaucoma - on
eyedrops; history of venous stasis of lower extremity with
skin changes.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Cholecystectomy in [**2197**].

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  VITAL SIGNS:  Pulse 69; O2 sat 100% on
room air; blood pressure 158/96. GENERAL APPEARANCE:  A thin,
elderly female in no acute distress. The patient was
cooperative and oriented x 3, but is very hard of hearing.
HEENT:  Unremarkable exam. LUNGS:  Clear to auscultation.
HEART:  Regular rate and rhythm. ABDOMEN:  Soft; nontender;
with a well-healed midline incision. EXTREMITIES:  Exam
showed mild edema of the left lower extremity. The foot was
cool and pale. Skin was dry. There were areas of scattered
ecchymosis over the legs. Pulses were not palpable.
NEUROLOGIC:  Nonfocal exam.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the
preoperative holding area on [**2200-7-14**]. She underwent a
right femoral to AK popliteal bypass with PTFE. She was
transferred to the PACU in stable condition. In the PACU, the
patient had difficulties with hypotension. The femoral pulse
was palpable, with a dopplerable posterior tibial and an
absent DP. The patient required 1 unit of packed cells.
Troponins were cycled. The patient's hypotension improved
with volume resuscitation. Cardiology was consulted because
of the patient's hypotension. They recommended diuresis with
Lasix as required and fluid resuscitation as required. I also
recommended that the EP service come by and interrogate the
pacer and increase the heart rate to 90. The pacemaker was
interrogated, and the patient remained in a VVI mode with a
base rate of 90 beats per minute. The autocapture is off. The
pulse amplitude was 3.50. The pulse width was 0.4, and the
sensitivity was 2.0, with improvement in the patient's
hemodynamic status. It was noted at this time that there was
a pulse change. The patient was reintubated because of her
hypotension and pulse change, and the patient returned to the
OR and underwent a right femoral-AK popliteal embolectomy and
was transferred to the ICU on a vent. Serial troponins were
0.01 to 0.02. The patient remained on heparin at 500
units/hour, with a PTT of 71. The patient was transfused a
second unit of packed cells for her hematocrit of 28 to 26.
BUN was 38. Creatinine was 1.7. The recommendation was to
begin weaning of pressor support to maintain a systolic blood
pressure of greater than 90.

On postoperative day 2, the patient developed new aortic
insufficiency with hypotension. The patient required urgent
cardioversion with 200 W/sec and was V-paced. The patient
remained in the ICU. The patient continued on heparin. She
continued on vasopressor support. There was a small hematoma
noted in the right groin area and this was stable.

Postoperative day #4, the patient remained on heparin. She
remained on her amiodarone drip at 0.5. She continued to be V-
paced. Her post-transfusion hematocrit was 37. Her Swan was
discontinued. Subcu heparin was instituted, and her diet was
advanced as tolerated. The patient's amiodarone IV load was
completed. On postoperative day 4, EP was requested to
decrease the ventricular pacing rate from 90 beats per minute
to 70. The battery is 2.73 V. The patient is in VVI. The V
threshold is 1.50, and the MS is 0.4. Lead impedance is 520.
The patient remains in V-pacing with an intrinsic regular
rhythm at a rate of 88 beats. At 3:30 in the afternoon, the
patient developed acute congestive failure requiring
diuresis, with improvement in her clinical state.

On postoperative day 5, the patient had episodes of
hallucinations. The geriatric service was requested to see
the patient. Recommendations were 1-to-1 observation and
frequent reorientation and if family could be with the
patient that would be of assistance. A recommendation was
made to avoid Haldol secondary to drug interactions and QT
prolongation. A recommendation was made to consider Zyprexa
2.5 mg if agitated and aggressive and this may be repeated up
to 10 mg per 24 hours as necessary. The amitriptyline and
Ambien were discontinued.

The patient was transferred to the VICU on [**2200-7-21**].
Fever workup was done. Postoperative day 7, the patient had
recurrence of atrial fibrillation and cardiology was
reconsulted for consideration of cardioversion. They felt
that this was possibly more atrial tachycardia versus atrial
fibrillation, which was probably secondary to the patient's
increased catecholamine, anemia, and hypovolemia, which had
improved. Recommendations were to discontinue the amiodarone
drip, a goal CVP of 10 to 12, that we should continue the IV
heparin, and to institute metoprolol 25 mg q.8 hours and
increase as needed for a heart rate goal of less than 90.
Physical therapy did see the patient and felt that she would
require rehab. The patient continued to require increases in
her metoprolol doses for a heart rate of less than 90.
Anticoagulation was instituted for a goal INR of 2.0 to 3.0.
Heparin will be continued until the patient has reached the
INR goal. The patient's general condition remained stable.
She did require continued adjustment in her metoprolol dosing
because of hypotension on the night of [**Month (only) 205**] __________, [**2199**].
Her dose at the time of the hypotensive episode was 100 mg
t.i.d. This was changed to 75 mg t.i.d. with improvement in
her blood pressure control. The patient will be discharged to
rehab. The patient's O2 should be weaned to maintain an O2
sat greater than 90%.

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:  Please wean O2 to maintain O2 sat
greater than 90%. Her INR should be monitored as required
over the next several days to maintain a goal INR of 2.0 to
3.0 both for her atrial fib/flutter and her PTFE graft
patency. The patient should follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1391**] in 2
weeks' time and call for an appointment at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 1393**]. The
patient should also follow up with the cardiology service
within the next 2 weeks. The patient should follow up with
Dr. __________ in 1 to 2 weeks post discharge or with Dr.
[**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]. Please call for an appointment at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 78546**].
