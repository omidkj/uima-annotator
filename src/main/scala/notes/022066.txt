Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none


History of Present Illness:
53yoF with hx of DM, asthma, DVTs s/p IVC filter on plavix and
coumadin,who presents from home with acute onset shortness of
breath and pleuritic chest pain.  Mrs. [**Known lastname 11468**] was at home
babys[**Name (NI) 12854**] for her grandaughter, sitting on the sofa, when she
became acutely short of breath.  She had pain with inspiration,
but no other chest pain or chest pressure, no n/v, no
diaphoresis.  At home she has stable [**2-22**] pillow orthopnea,
becomes short of breath with mild exertion although she does not
report any history of chest pain with exertion.  Of note, she
reports she has never experienced acute shortness of breath like
this before.  EMS was called, found pt to have systolic blood
pressure of 200, she was given nitro and lasix for presumed
heart failure (although she has no documented history of CHF).
She reports some mild URI symptoms 2 weeks ago which are now
resolved, as well as increased bilateral leg edema at that time,
but no current fevers, chills, or cough.  She also reports that
she has been compliant with all of her medications.
   In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, her vitals were temp of 100.5, HR 81, BP
153/87, RR 22, 100% on nonrebreather, with desatting to the 70s
on room air.  Labs were significant for normal chem 7, WBC 6,
BNP of 1168 and negative Troponins.  EKG was unchanged from
previous.  CXR showed cardiomegaly, and a density in the right
lower lobe which was read as possible early infection vs.
atelectasis.  She was given a dose of levofloxacin for community
aquired pna and trasnfered to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for further management.

She reports dark stools, but these are unchanged (she is on PO
iron), ROS was otherwise negative.

Social History:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 11468**] reports living by herself in [**Location (un) 686**], although
her daughter lives nearby and she babysits for her grandaughter
[**Name (NI) 12855**].  She is currently out of work, but formerly
worked as a special needs counsellor.  She does not drink
alcohol.  She quit smoking one year ago, but had a history of 1
pack per week for 40 years.  She has no history of any drug use.



Family History:
Mother and father both died of [**Name (NI) 499**] CA, and she also has a
grandmother and uncle with [**Name2 (NI) 499**] CA. No hx of hypercoagulability
or AVMS.

STUDIES:
.
CXR:
SINGLE AP VIEW OF THE CHEST: Examination is limited by
breathing. Within
this limitation, there is density and atelectasis in the right
lower lobe.
Underlying or early infection cannot be excluded in this region.
The
remainder of the lungs are clear without pneumothorax, pleural
effusion. The
heart size is enlarged. The mediastinal and hilar contours are
normal. No
soft tissue or osseous abnormality is detected.

IMPRESSION:
1. Limited study, however, interval development of a density and
atelectasis
in the right lower lobe. Early infection cannot be excluded.

2. Cardiac enlargement.

.
Echocardiogram:

The left atrium is moderately dilated. The estimated right
atrial pressure is 0-5 mmHg. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and
regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). The estimated
cardiac index is normal (>=2.5L/min/m2). Tissue Doppler imaging
suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure
(PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The diameters of aorta at the sinus,
ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and
no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial
effusion.

IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
preserved global and regional biventricular systolic function.
Mild mitral regurgitation. Diastolic dysfunction with increased
PCWP. Mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.

[**3-16**] Pelvis and L-spine film to r/o fx [**2-21**] to fall:

HISTORY: Morbid obesity with diabetes with back pain after fall.


FINDINGS: The prior study is not available on the PACS at this
time. The
vertebra and intervertebral disc spaces are quite well
maintained without
evidence of compression fracture. Of incidental note is evidence
of previous [**Month/Day (2) 1106**] surgery on the left and an IVC filter.


Brief Hospital Course:
53 yo F with hx of DM, asthma, DVTs s/p IVC filter on plavix and
coumadin now, who presents from home with acute onset shortness
of breath and evidence of heart failure on arrival to the ICU
and PNA with initial hypoxia to the 70s - and placed on a NRB.
Ms. [**Known lastname 11468**] was quickly weaned off of the non-rebreather that
was started in the ED to 4L NC.  She was stable on her
night-time CPAP overnight in the ICU (admitted to ICU [**2-21**] to sig
hypoxia, noted recieved IVF prior in ED with PNA as admitted
dx).  Antibiotics were continued for community-acquired PNA.
Given her presentation in the setting of elevated systolic blood
pressure, she was diuresed with 20mg IV furosemide for concern
of flash pulmonary edema contributing to her hypoxia.  On am of
[**3-16**] - pt more stable from resp standpoint with 97% on RA, pt
was transferred to floor, give 1 more dose of po lasix 20mg -
feeling well am of [**3-17**] - ambulating without DOE, 92% on RA o2
sat, Echo showing evid of mild pulm HTN and dCHF without evid of
sCHF.  Pt will be given CHF instruction, given a Rx for 20mg po
lasix but to be taking only PRN - not on a scheduled dose for
now - ***will need close f/u with her PCP in regards to this
with focus now to keep BP controlled.

1. Dyspnea - more likely due to mild secondary pulmonary HTN
with low thresholds for decompensation - here with mild PNA,
bacterial (Community acquired) and CHF exacerbation - diastolic
