Admission Date:  [**2114-10-18**]       Discharge Date:  [**2114-11-1**]

Date of Birth:   [**2043-12-9**]       Sex:  F

Service:  CT [**Doctor First Name 147**]

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 70 year old
female with a history of chronic back pain initially admitted
to an outside hospital for mental status changes per husband
and son.  [**Name (NI) **] has been increasingly "out of it" for the
last month with slurred speech, ataxia and disorientation.
She had worsened from [**10-11**] through the 11th to the
degree such that the family brought her to [**Hospital6 3426**] for evaluation of her mental status.  Thought to be
amiodarone toxic at the outside hospital secondary to the
fact that patient had been taking three times the dose due to
confusion about the dose.  Amiodarone was stopped on
[**9-20**].  At the outside hospital cardiac enzymes were
positive and patient ruled in for myocardial infarction and
was transferred to [**Hospital1 69**] for
cardiac cath.  Cath revealed three vessel disease and CABG
had been recommended.  Carotid ultrasound had been done
preoperatively.  Plan was made for possible carotid
endarterectomy prior to CABG due to significant left carotid
artery disease.  Additionally, psych was consulted on [**10-21**] as patient seemed to be increasingly agitated and was
confused after being examined by the cardiothoracic surgery
service.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for atrial fibrillation
status post cardioversion five weeks prior to admission.
History of coronary artery disease with stable angina now
with recent myocardial infarction ruling in for a non-Q wave
MI.  Hypercholesterolemia.  Migraines.  Peripheral vascular
disease status post multiple interventions.  Hypertension.
Chronic back pain.  Status post prior carotid endarterectomy
on the left.

OUTPATIENT MEDICATIONS:  Medications at home include Depakote
125 mg p.o. b.i.d., Effexor 150 mg q.day, OxyContin 20 mg
b.i.d., temazepam 15 mg one to two tabs p.r.n. insomnia at
hour of sleep.  At the time of evaluation by the cardiac
service she additionally was taking digoxin 0.25 mg p.o.
q.day, metoprolol 100 mg p.o. t.i.d., docusate 100 mg p.o.
b.i.d., zolpidem tartrate 2.5 mg p.o. q.h.s. p.r.n., Effexor
XR 150 mg p.o. q.day, Depakote 125 mg p.o. b.i.d.,
pantoprazole 40 mg p.o. q.24, nitro drip, heparin IV,
lisinopril 20 mg p.o. b.i.d., atorvastatin 80 mg p.o. q.day,
aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.day.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  After evaluations were executed by the
psych service as well as the vascular team and cardiology
service, it was determined that patient was likely suffering
from resolving delirium.  She was cleared for surgery.
Ultimately on [**2114-10-22**] Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1391**] took patient to the
operating room and operated on patient secondary to recurrent
right carotid stenosis.  She underwent right carotid
endarterectomy with patch angioplasty.  She had 50 cc EBL for
the procedure with fluids 800 cc of lactated Ringer.  She had
no Foley and was due to void.  It was performed under general
endotracheal anesthesia.  There was a plaque in the right
common carotid artery extending into the internal carotid
artery.  A single specimen of the right carotid plaque was
sent to pathology.  Patient was extubated and sent to the
post anesthesia recovery unit in satisfactory condition.  On
the night of surgery patient was seen by psychiatry.  They
had recommended continuing temazepam, hold Effexor and Ambien
during the acute postoperative period.  Also there were
recommendations from Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] of the psychiatry to follow
up patient's TSH given the possibility of amiodarone toxicity
at the outside hospital where the initial workup of her
mental status changes had originally begun.  Effexor XR could
be added back postoperatively.  They wanted to avoid
anticholinergics.  They wanted to otherwise try to simplify
pain regimen and avoid Ambien altogether.

Postoperatively patient was noted on post-op day one, [**10-23**], to be having no complaints of chest pain, shortness of
breath, no nausea, vomiting.  She was neurologically intact,
alert and oriented times three at this time.  Hematocrit at
this time was 27.1 down from 3.18 preoperatively from carotid
endarterectomy.  BUN and creatinine were 9 and 0.7.  Enzymes
were ruled out times three postoperatively.  This was done
empirically.  Right neck incision was small with some
ecchymosis, but no evidence of hematoma.  Ultimately patient
was doing well, hemodynamically stable.  She was taken to the
operating room to have sequential CABG performed.  That was
secondary to her recent myocardial infarction and significant
cath findings showing two vessel disease.  She underwent
off-pump coronary artery bypass graft times two including
LIMA to LAD and saphenous vein graft to OM.  This was done
under general endotracheal anesthesia.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1537**] performed
the procedure with the assistance of [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].
Pericardium was left open.  Patient had left ulnar arterial
line, left IJ oximetric Swan-Ganz catheter.  Two ventricular
wires were placed.  There were two mediastinal tubes.  It was
noted that there was severe MAC and there was anterior aortic
plaque as well as they had to utilize oximetry device for the
proximal anastomosis.  At the end of the procedure patient
had mean arterial pressure of 90, CVP 21, PAD 37, coronary
artery mean pressure 48.  She was in a-fib with a slow
ventricular response with a rate of 52.  She was on
Neo-Synephrine 0.5 mcg per kg per minute and propofol 100 mcg
per kg per minute.

Postoperatively on post-op day one, patient remained
intubated and sedated.  Lungs were otherwise clear.
Extremities were benign.  Dressings were clean and dry.  She
was placed on aspirin and Plavix with Lasix accordingly.
Hematocrit was 35.6 at this time with BUN and creatinine 4
and 0.6.  CO2 was 70 with PA pressure of 60/26, CVP 13,
cardiac index 1.99.  Gas was pH 7.43, PACO2 41, PAO2 110,
base excess 2, 96% saturation.  She had received large volume
preoperatively for resuscitation.  Had adequate urine output
and was thereafter serially diuresed.  At this time psych had
recommended utilizing Haldol 0.5 mg p.o. or IV q.two to three
hours p.r.n. and hold if QTc was greater than 500.  On
post-op day two patient was extubated, was alert and
oriented, still on Nipride and nitro for blood pressure
control as her blood pressure was in the 190s for a
significant portion of her postoperative course in the first
48 hours.  Ultimately this was weaned back and oral agents
such as Lopressor and Norvasc and lisinopril were titrated to
maintain adequate blood pressure control.

Neurology was asked to see patient because of persistent
postoperative delirium which became more evident again on
post-op day two from CABG.  At this time her medications
included Plavix, docusate, ranitidine, aspirin, sucralfate,
vancomycin peri-op, insulin, nitroglycerin, propofol drip,
amiodarone and Toprol.  She received 8 mg of morphine on
[**2114-10-25**], 20 mg on [**10-26**] and 6 mg on the morning of [**10-27**]
which were thought to potentially contribute to the patient's
state.  She was irregularly irregular on exam.  Her wound was
otherwise intact, clean and dry without drainage.  After
being seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 10030**], it was felt that patient, in fact,
did have persistent delirium likely toxic metabolic.  She
could utilize antipsychotic medications as needed such as
Haldol p.r.n. with titration to QTc interval.  On post-op day
three she was hemodynamically stable.  Blood pressure
remained somewhat elevated.  She was out of bed, ambulating
otherwise, eating, conversant, less combative.  By post-op
day four she continued to have labile BPs and low cardiac
indices.  She was getting around a lot and complaining of
persistent low back pain which she had at baseline.  At this
time Nipride was 2.5, amiodarone drip 0.5.  She was off
esmolol drip.  Lisinopril was administered 10 mg p.o. b.i.d.
She was also g
