Chief Complaint:
Chest pain

None


History of Present Illness:
(HPI taken through a translator) Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a [**Age over 90 **]yo Russian
female with a PMH of CAD s/p multiple MIs and PCIs, CRI, afirb,
CHF, and chronic anemia who is admitted after developing chest
pain at [**Hospital 100**] Rehab. However, she states that she believes the
reason for her admission is for persistent abd pain/inflammation
that she acquired during her last admission. Her biggest
complaint currently is that she has a lot of hiccups, burping,
and nausea, and as a result, has not been eating. She feels that
she ends up vomiting after every time she eats solid foods, but
that she can tolerate liquids. Regardless, she feels like she
does not have an appetite. She feels like she has thick mucus in
her throat/esophagus that makes it difficult for her to swallow.
She feels like she has had this sore throat since her last
intubation. Because she has not been eating as much, she feels
weak and like she is losing strength. In further ROS, she does
note that she had an episode of CP yesterday that left her SOB,
but states that she has had CP regularly ever since her MI. She
describes the chest pain as being localized to the lateral
aspect of her left breast but exactly like her anginal pain,
only "lighter". It radiated around her ribs to her back. The
chest pain lasts no longer than 5 minutes and goes away on its
own. She does get SOB and dizzy w/ the CP, but she was told not
to take nitro because it makes her BP too low. She currently
denies feeling SOB. She states she has not had diarrhea today,
that her last episode of diarrhea was yesterday and was caused
by the contrast that she drank for the CT scan. Her stools are
black, nonbloody, but have been black for a while b/c of her
iron supplementation. She denies any dysuria or hematuria but
does note that she has to push to begin urinating. She also
notes that she feels that her abdomen is bloated

CXR [**2156-1-18**]: Single portable chest radiograph demonstrates no
change in the cardiomediastinal silhouette when compared to
[**2156-1-16**].  Prominent pulmonary vasculature and bilateral
airspace opacities are similar in appearance when compared to
the previous study and represent pulmonary edema.  There may be
a tiny right-sided pleural effusion.  Left chest cardiac
pacemaker obscures the left costophrenic angle.  Cardiac leads
are unchanged in position.  The aorta is calcified and tortuous.
 Deviation of the trachea from the midline to the right is
attributable to the tortuous aorta.  Oral contrast within the
colon is seen to project over the left upper quadrant.
IMPRESSION: CHF, unchanged.


Brief Hospital Course:
[**Age over 90 **]F w/ significant cardiac history recently admitted [**1-13**] for
chest pain, shortness of breath, and abdominal pain, transferred
from the floor for hypoxia. She had been doing well on the floor
with resolution of her chest pain and nausea, when she was noted
around 4am to have an acute onset of desaturation to 75% on room
air. She was placed on 10L face mask with improvement to 95%,
although she remained tachypneic to the 40s even on a NRB. A
chest x-ray was limited but showed new bilateral opacities
(including right upper zone and left lower zone) and congestive
heart failure. She was given a nebulizer treatment and lasix
20mg IV x 1 without significant improvement. She was written for
levofloxacin 250mg x 1. She was determined to be DNR/DNI,
confirmed with the patient. She was transferred to the ICU for
mask ventilation, frequent neb treatment, and closer monitoring.
.
On return to the floor, the patient had several problems as
below:
.
1. hypoxia/respiratory distress - The patient had CXR findings
c/w PNA and CHF.  She was treated w/ vanco/zosyn and became
afebrile w/ a normal WBC on this regimen.  Her cultures were
never positive.  Her home lasix was restarted and she responded
well to this.  She was maintained on nebulizer treatments
throughout her stay and was stable on 2L prior to d/c.
.
2. CV:
A. Coronaries: The pt has known CAD with 3vd s/p multiple
interventions. Although there are no ECG changes to explain this
acute decompensation, it would be difficult to interpret in the
setting of paced rhythm.  CE were cycled 3 times, trop max of
0.16, likely due to demand ischemia, CK and MB were negative.
She was continued on cont. ASA 325mg once daily, plavix 75mg
once daily, lipitor 80mg QHS and metoprolol 12.5mg [**Hospital1 **]
.
b. Pump: The acute decompensation as well as the CXR finding is
consistent with some degree of CHF. Given the concomitant
opacities noted on CXR and concern for infectious process, we
aimed for modest diuresis 500cc-1L initially.  She was given IV
lasix which she responded well to.  She was also continued on
imdur/hydral and metoprolol as above.  Her BP and urine output
decreased which was thought to be secondary to her
antihypertensives so hydral and imdur was discontinued.  She
should eventually be started on [**Last Name (un) **] (ACE allergy) for afterload
reduction but because her BP was running from 100-110 systolic
this decision was deferred to the outpatient setting.
.
c. Rhythm: The pt has a hx of sick sinus node dysfunction and is
s/p PPM. In addition, she has a history of afib and is on
coumadin anticoagulation and Amiodarone HCl 200mg po daily.
Amiodarone was continued.  Coumadin was held initially given
concern for bleeding (see below) but restarted once the hct was
stable.
.
3. Anemia with acute drop in hematocrit - pt w/ Hct drop of 9
points, now stable. This was thought to be not likely a true
drop - 33 likely a spurious value. Pt received 2 units PRBCs,
and hct remained stable ~29 thereafter. She has a h/o chronic
anemia secondary to CRI.
.
4. CRI: elevation of creatinine on admission but trending down
to baseline at the time of d/c.
.
5. C diff - she has a history of recent c diff that has
resolved.  HOwever, given that antibiotics were restarted, will
continue flagyl while abx are being used, stop it when other abx
are d/c'd.
.
6. Hypothyroidism - continued levothyroxine
