CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Symptomatic bradycardia.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 81-year-old male with
a history of coronary artery disease, peripheral vascular
disease, atrial fibrillation and flutter who was recently
discharged from the [**Hospital6 **] in [**Location 1268**] after
undergoing a left femoropopliteal bypass surgery on [**2185-5-16**].
The patient was discharged to rehabilitation.  He had
previously been on Lopressor and digoxin.  He was started on
amiodarone 400 mg p.o. t.i.d. for atrial fibrillation.  On
[**2185-6-2**], the patient was found by his roommate to be
confused, and there was a question of a fall.  EMS was
called.  On initial examination the patient had a heart rate
in the 20s to 30s with systolic blood pressures in the 80s.
The patient was awake but confused.  At an outside hospital,
the patient was intubated, and transcutaneously paced.  He
was subsequently started on pressors for hypotension.  The
patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 188**] for further care.  Here an arterial line was placed,
and pressors were weaned off with a blood pressure of 150/60
with pacing at 80.  The patient was able to sustain his
pressure after the pacer was stopped, even though his
intrinsic heart rate was in the 30s.  The patient was
admitted to the coronary care unit for close observation
secondary to intubation.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1. Peripheral vascular disease, status
post left femoropopliteal bypass bypass surgery on [**2185-5-16**].
2. Status post bilateral CEAs.  3. Coronary artery disease,

bowel sounds.  Extremities:  2+ lower extremity edema
bilaterally, staples in the right arm and left groin, sutures
in the left foot, status post multiple toe amputations, cool
extremities, nonpalpable lower extremity pulses, otherwise
wounds are clean, dry and intact.  Neurological:

bulk.

LABORATORY DATA:  White count 9.1 with 77% neutrophils, 19%
lymphocytes, 3% monocytes, hematocrit 31.8, platelet count
306.  Sodium 136, potassium 4.6, chloride 106, bicarbonate
14, BUN 40, creatinine 1.7, glucose 312, calcium 7.4,
magnesium 1.8, phosphorous 5.3.  PT 28.3, PTT 44.7, INR 5.3.
CK 47, troponin less than 0.3.  Arterial blood gas was 7.24,
36, 178.  Urinalysis showed a specific gravity of 1.015,
large blood, 100 protein, trace ketones, leukocyte esterase
and urine nitrite negative.

EKG at the outside hospital showed junctional fascicular
escape rhythm at 64 beats per minute, retrograde PEs, ST
depressions at V2 to V4.  In the Emergency Department here
junctional fascicular escape at 36 beats per minute,
retrograde PEs, ST depressions in V3 through V5, right bundle
branch block pattern.

STUDIES:  Chest x-ray at the outside hospital showed
cardiomegaly, bilateral fluffy infiltrates with increased
vascular markings.

Transthoracic echocardiogram from [**2185-5-20**] showed an ejection
fraction of 45-50%, mild left ventricular hypertrophy, global
hypokinesis, no focal wall motion abnormalities, [**2-7**]+ mitral
regurgitation, 1+ tricuspid regurgitation.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  This is an 81-year-old male with a past
medical history significant for coronary artery disease,
status post myocardial infarction and coronary artery bypass
grafting, peripheral vascular disease, atrial fibrillation
and flutter, who was sent from rehabilitation with mental
status changes, and symptomatic bradycardia with heart rates
in the 20s and hypotension.  The patient was intubated,
placed on pressors, transcutaneously paced.  Here an arterial
line was placed, pressors were weaned off, pacing was
stopped, patient was able to maintain blood pressures at
140/50 even though he still had an intrinsic junctional
escape rhythm in the 30s.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  1. Coronary artery disease:  The patient
ended up ruling in for myocardial infarction, even though his
peak CPK was 109, MB of 16, MB index of 14.7, and troponin I
of 4.1.  We believe that this all can be accounted for by the
transcutaneous pacing that he received rather than an actual
new myocardial infarction.  There was no obvious ischemia or
myocardial infarction in any particular distribution on EKG.
The patient was eventually placed on a cardiac regimen
including aspirin and Lopressor titrated up to 50 mg p.o.
b.i.d.  Given the fact that the patient has a history of
rhabdomyolysis in response to statins, he was not placed on a
statin.  Instead, the patient was started on gemfibrozil on
discharge.

2. Rhythm:  As already noted, the patient presented with a
junctional fascicular block.  We feel that this was
iatrogenic in origin in response to getting an amiodarone
loading dose of 400 mg p.o. t.i.d. for at least one to two
weeks.  This was in addition to other nodal blocking agents
that the patient was on including Lopressor and possibly
digoxin even though digoxin was not listed as one of the
rehabilitation medications, but had been taken previously by
the patient.  Of note, in addition to transcutaneous pacing,
the patient at one point did receive atropine on the field,
at the same time he was started on pressors including
dopamine and Neo-Synephrine.  Even though the patient was
able to maintain his blood pressure without the
transcutaneous pacer, a temporary pacer wire was placed by
the electrophysiologists.  However, as all nodal blocking
agents were stopped, the patient converted back to normal
sinus rhythm and did not need the temporary pacer wire.
Eventually, it was felt that the patient was safe enough to
be on Lopressor for his coronary artery needs in addition to
rate control.  Of note, the patient has a history of atrial
fibrillation and flutter.  He did not exhibit this rhythm
during this hospitalization.  The patient was placed on
heparin while hospitalized for atrial fibrillation.  However,
it was decided that the patient was too much of a fall risk,
especially given his presentation, and heparin was stopped
and it was decided that it was too risky to continue any
anticoagulation for paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.

3. Pump:  The patient has no known history of congestive
heart failure, but does have prior coronary disease.  The
patient had an episode of hypoxia on [**2185-6-5**], and was noted
to be volume overloaded on chest x-ray.  The patient
responded well to 40 IV of Lasix with good diuresis.  An
echocardiogram was performed on [**2185-6-6**].  This showed an
ejection fraction of 30-35%.  There was left atrial mild
dilatation, mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Left ventricular cavity size was noted to be normal.  Left
ventricular systolic function
