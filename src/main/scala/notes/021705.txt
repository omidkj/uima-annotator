[**8-8**] CT head: extracalvarial soft tissue injury. No fx. No
intracranial injury.
[**8-8**] c-spine:. Type 2 odontoid fracture (unstable). B/L lamina
fractures of C1, age-indeterminate fx spinous process C7 vs.
calcification of the ligamentum nuchae. ? ligamentous
instability at C0-C1 on the right as above. There may be an
element of atlanto-occipital instability.
[**8-8**] torso: Question compression-type deformity at T12.
Compression fractures involving T12 and L4. These are likely
chronic although the superior endplate L4 fracture does
protrudes slightly posteriorly
into the spinal canal.
[**8-8**] ECHO: Moderate regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction, c/w prior extensive infarction in the LCx
territory. Mild aortic regurgitation. Moderate mitral
regurgitation, secondary to leaflet tethering. Moderate to
severe tricuspid regurgitation. Moderate pulmonary hypertension.



    Cardiology Report ECG Study Date of [**2138-8-17**]  9:57:42 AM
 Atrial fibrillation. Ventricular ectopy. Diffuse non-specific
ST-T wave
changes. Compared to the previous tracing no significant change.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
AP CHEST 10:59 A.M. [**8-17**]

HISTORY: Spine fracture. G-tube placement.

IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**8-10**] through 7:

No endotracheal tube is seen below C7, the upper margin of this
film nor is there a radiopaque esophageal tube. Lung volumes are
lower than on Augst 7 and there is a band of subpleural
atelectasis along the minor fissure. Pulmonary vascular
congestion is also slightly more pronounced but there is no
pulmonary edema despite chronic moderate-to-severe cardiomegaly
and transvenous right atrial and right ventricular pacer leads,
in standard placements. There is no substantial pleural effusion
or indication of pneumothorax.

[**8-10**] ECHO
Conclusions:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated.
There is moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction
with focal
thinning/akinesis of the inferolateral wall and severe
hypokinesis of the
inferior and apical segments. The remaining left ventricular
segments contract
normally.No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
The right
ventricular cavity is dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (?) are
moderately
thickened. Aortic stenosis was not assessed.. No aortic
regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation
is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no
pericardial effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2138-8-8**],
left ventricular
systolic function is mildly improved, but the right ventricle is
now larger
and free wall hypokinesis is now suggested. Aortic regurgitation
is not seen
on the current study (may be related to heart rate/technique)
and the rhythm
is now atrial fibrillation.





Brief Hospital Course:
He was admitted to the Trauma Service. Neurosurgery was
consulted because of his spine fracture; this injury was deemed
non operative. He is to remain in a hard cervical collar for the
next 4-8 weeks; he will follow up in [**Hospital 4695**] clinic in 4
weeks for repeat imaging.

Plastic surgery was also consulted for the laceration to his
forehead; this was irrigated and closed with suturing. He was
started on antibiotics as prophylaxis.
Sutures were removed on day of discharge.

Geriatric Medicine was also consulted given his age,
co-morbidities and mechanism of injury. He was noted to have
periods of apnea during his hospital stay during the night on
[**8-17**]; ABG's were drawn and were  307* 35 7.56* 32* 9. It is felt
that the apnea likely related to his CHF; his diuretics were
adjusted, he is currently on 60 mg po Lasix [**Hospital1 **]. He has required
supplemental oxygen as well. An ECHO was done on [**8-8**] which
revealed mild MR, but no aortic stenosis. It is being
recommended that he have a sleep study as an outpatient.

There was much discussion between the Trauma service, Geriatrics
and the patient's primary cardiologist regarding restarting his
Coumadin. The final decision was made by his Cardiologist that
he wanted the Coumadin restarted. His last INR was 1.3 on [**8-19**],
his dose was increased from 10mg to 3 mg. Goal INR should be
between [**2-8**]. He remained in atrial fibrillation during his stay
here; rate in the 80's to 90's, his beta blockers were
increased.

He also was quite delirious during his hospital stay felt
secondary to the injury and medications. He underwent CT head
imaging on [**8-8**] and [**8-10**] which revealed no intracranial processes.
He was started on Haldol to control the agitated behaviors; the
dose was eventually decreased because of increased drowsiness.
Sitters were initially in place and these were also eventually
discontinued.

There were also problems with urinary retention during his stay;
it was recommended by Geriatrics that his Foley catheter be
removed in order to not further aggravate the delirium with
excess lines, catheters, etc. He will require straight
catheterization q 4-6 hours once at rehab.

He was evaluated by Physical and Occupational therapy who have
recommended rehab stay after discharge.
