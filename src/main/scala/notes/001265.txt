Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 103044**] was admitted to the ICU from the emergency
department due to hematocrit of 18, and unstable hemodynamic
status. Gastroenterology was consulted. Once resuscitated,
patient underwent a sigmoidoscopy  which revealed radiation
proctitis, clotted blood in rectum. No active bleeding
visualized. She was transfused with PRBC's and her hct increased
appropriately.  Patient passed a few blood clots per rectum
during the course of the admission however hct's were followed
serially and were found to be stable at 28 on discharge.

Patient had one trigger event as her heart rate increased to 140
beats per minute.  Patient remained asymptomatic and her heart
rate returned to [**Location 213**] after IV metoprolol.  This episode
thought likely secondary to long duration between last diltiazam
dose and first extended release diltiazam dose.  EKG without
change.  Labs were drawn at the time of the trigger and her
electrolytes were found to be within normal limits, troponin
<0.1, CK MB 4.  Patient stable on discharge.
