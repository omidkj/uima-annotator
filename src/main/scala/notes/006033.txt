History of Present Illness:
54 F wiht h/o HTN, asthma, recent admission to CCU for
pericardial/pleural effusion and tamponade presents from home
after episode of syncope this morning. Patient was walking to
the bathroom and felt dizzy, then found on the floor by her
husband. She does not know if she hit her head but reports right
buttock pain from the fall. Since her discharge she has been
feeling "tired" and has had a poor appetite but denies any chest
pain or shortness of breath. She has been getting around her
apartment easily. She endorses "tightness" with deep
inspiration. Otherwise no fever, chills, GI, or GU complaints.
.
Patient initially presented with DOE and right flank pain and
was evaluated by her PCP found to have cardiomegaly on CXR.
Subsequent [**First Name3 (LF) 113**] showed a large pericardial effusion with
tamponade physiology. She was admitted to the CCU from [**5-11**] to
[**5-16**] s/p periocardiocentesis. Patient also underwent right sided
thoracentesis. Both sources are showing evidence of a highly
differentiated adenocarcinoma. Patient was discharged with PCP
follow up and ongoing workup. CT of the abd/pelvis did not
reveal a source but did reveal some bony lytic lesions in the
right ischium and bilateral ilia concerning for metastatic
disease. Of note, she also is known to have a large common
femoral DVT.
.
In the ED, VS 97.5 113 86/68-->106/59 94% RA-->98% NRB. Bedside
[**Month/Day (4) 113**] showing large pericardial effusion. Given 1L NS and taken
to cath lab for urgent pericardiocentesis.

AP PELVIS: No fracture or dislocation is identified within the

detected.
.
CXR [**5-30**]:
Single AP chest radiograph demonstrate hazy opacity within the
right lung base likely representing atelectasis vs air space
disease. Small right pleural effusion is present. Compared to
prior radiograph from [**2181-5-15**], there is moderate cardiac
enlargement, concerning for pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION:
1. Opacity in right lung base concerning for atelectasis vs
airspace
disease. Small right pleural effusion.
2. Compared to prior radiograph from [**2181-5-15**], there is
moderate increase in cardiac size, concerning for pericardial
effusion.
.
Urgent [**Year (4 digits) **] [**5-30**]:
Large pericardial effusion. Effusion circumferential. Stranding

is visualized within the pericardial space c/w organization. RV
diastolic collapse, c/w impaired fillling/tamponade physiology.

GENERAL COMMENTS: Emergency study performed by the cardiology
fellow on call
.
post procedure [**Month/Year (2) **] [**5-31**]: Overall left ventricular systolic
function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size
and free wall motion are normal. The estimated pulmonary artery
systolic pressure is normal. There is a trivial/physiologic
pericardial effusion.
.
Repeat [**Month/Year (2) **] [**6-4**]:Compared with the prior study (images reviewed)
of [**2181-6-2**], there is probably no signficant change. A
loculated pericardial effusion with constriction should be
considered.
.
Endoscopy [**6-4**]:Gastro esophageal junction mucosal biopsy:
Gastric type mucosa with chronic active inflammation.
Very focal intestinal metaplasia consistent with Barrett's
esophagus in the appropriate clinical setting.
No dysplasia.
Squamous mucosa with focal active inflammation
.
Colonoscopy [**6-5**]: No masses or polyps seen.  External
hemorrhoids.


Brief Hospital Course:
Pt is a 54 y/o woman here with recurrent malignant pericardial
effusion.  Hospital course by problem:
.
# Malignant Effusion. s/p pericardiocentesis and balloon
pericardiotomy with removal of 520 cc of bloody fluid. Patient
with known highly differentiated adenocarcinoma of unknown
primary.  Fluid analysis suggested exudative fluid and cytology
again pending.  An [**Month/Year (2) 113**] on [**6-1**] showed partial resolution of
part of the pericardial effusion, but persistance of a loculated
effusion.  It was felt that the drain should be pulled and an
[**Month/Year (2) 113**] repeated on [**6-2**] showed no progression. [**Month/Year (2) **] on [**6-4**] showed
stable loculated pericardial effusion.
.
# Mucinous adenoca unknown primary: The heme/onc team was
consulted during admission and workup to determine source was
undertaken.  Endoscopy and colonoscopy were performed without
evidence of malignancy.
.
# DVT - large VTE in common femoral artery extending to IVC
found on CT scan.  On discharge from recent hospitalization she
was briefly anticoagulated.  This was stopped however given
concerns for recurrence of pericardial effusion.  We reviewed
recent CT scan and decided to place an IVC filter on day of
admission to help prevent spread of DVT into the pulm
vasculator.  The risks/benefits of anticoagulation were
considered and we opted to start heparin gtt with close
monitoring of her hemodynamics and pericardial output.  Shortly
after the IVC filter placement, she experience right sided
pleuritic chest pain.  This was thought to be a PE.  Her oxygen
requirement did not increase but she remained mildly
tachycardic. She was continued on heparin.  The heparin was held
for 24 hours after the drain was pulled. The patient was
restarted on SubQ Heparin and instructed on the use of Levonox
to continue on discharge.
.
# Right buttock pain: patient with lytic lesions found on CT
scan thought likely malignant. AP pelvis negative for fracture.

.
# Syncope - likely due to large pericardial effusion and
tamponade physiology
.
# CAD: no known CAD
.
# HTN: Held meds given tamponade, remained normotensive
throughout admission.
.
# Code: changed to DNR DNI after discussion
