Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 896**]
Chief Complaint:
Malaise, shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2186-1-27**]: Pericardiocentesis with drain placement
[**2186-1-31**]: Tracheal intubation
[**2186-1-31**]: Temp pacer wire
[**2186-2-1**]: Intranasal sinus mass biopsy
[**2186-2-6**]: Placement of dual chamber pacemaker
[**2186-2-13**]: Placement of percutaneous G-tube


History of Present Illness:
61 y/o male presents with malaise, DOE x 2 days. The patient has
not been to a physican in [**4-11**] years [**2-8**] insurance issues. Had
been on synthroid in the past but taken off by doctor 4-5 years
ago because thought not necessary. He developed general malaise,
dyspnea with exertion x 2 days and presented to [**Hospital3 6592**],
where the exam and story consistent with myxedema. Labs at [**Hospital1 **]
notable for CK of 2545, troponin T .15, TSH over 200. CBC with
WBC of 3.8 (50% neuts, 33% bands). His initial VS demonstrated a
pulse of 46 and a BP of 99/61, T 90.2F. He had occasional
depressions to HR 27 but these broke spontaneously after 30
seconds. The patient was given 150mg IV hydrocortisone, 162 ASA,
thiamine, and 750 IV levaquin. Transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further
evaluation.

At [**Hospital1 18**] ED initial vitals HR 48 123/68, 15 97% RA. Hypothermia
to 90.2 rectal. Warm blankets were applied. After discussion
with endocrine patient started on hydrocortisone 100 Q8 and
given levothyroxine 500mcg. He was also given vancomycin 1g.
Based on troponin leak cardiology was consulted; heparin was
initiated given concern for NSTEMI. Bedside ultrasound
demonstrated moderate sized pericardial effusion. Repeat
differential with no bands. He was transferred to the MICU for
further care.

OTHER RESULTS
=============
CARDIAC CATH [**1-27**]:

COMMENTS:
1. Cardiac tamponade
2. Successful pericardiocentesis with 260 cc of straw-colored
pericardial fluid removed and pericardial drain advanced into
position
under flouroscopic guidance without complications.
Intrapericardial
pressure reduced from 20 mmHg to [**3-11**] mmHg post
pericardiocentesis
3. Pericardial drain sutured into position with no issues

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Cardiac tamponade
2. Successful pericardiocentesis with 260 cc of straw-colored
pericardial fluid removed and pericardial drain advanced into
position
under flouroscopic guidance without complications.
Intrapericardial
pressure reduced from 20 mmHg to [**3-11**] mmHg post
pericardiocentesis.
3. Pericardial drain sutured into position without
complications.
.
POST CATH ECHO [**1-27**]:
Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global
systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. No definite
effusion seen.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of earlier in
the day, the right ventricular cavity is larger and the
pericardial effusion has resolved.

CT SINUS [**2186-2-1**]:
Very large, expansile, soft tissue density lesions centered
within the
paranasal sinuses with erosion and dehiscence of adjacent bone
and left
greater than right orbital involvement. There is dehiscence of
the posterior wall of the right frontal sinus, with no evidence
of frank intracranial extension. This is most suspicious for
extensive, severe sinonasal polyposis differential diagnosis
includes metastases or more aggressive etiology, fungal
infection, etc. ENT consult is recommended. If further imaging
is clinically necessary, MRI of the sinuses and brain with and
without gadolinium would better exclude intracranial involvement
and better evaluate the adjacent brain.

SINUS MASS PATHOLOGY
DIAGNOSIS:

RESPIRATORY MUCOSA AND SUBMUCOSA WITH FOCAL COLLECTIONS OF
LYMPHOCYTES AND POORLY FORMED HISTIOCYTIC GRANULOMA. THERE IS NO
EVIDENCE OF LYMPHOMA OR NON-LYMPHOID NEOPLASM IN THE BIOPSY. SEE
NOTE.

[**2-18**] Chest CT:
IMPRESSION:
1. No pulmonary embolus.
2. Bilateral apical scarring and superior hilar retraction as
well as diffuse
emphysematous changes and calcified mediastinal and hilar
lymphadenopathy,
again compatible with changes of prior or remote TB as was
previously queried,
though other granulomatous processes (sarcoid, silicosis) could
cause this
appearance.
3. New superimposed ground glass opacities, right upper lobe
focal
consolidation, and peribronchial thickening may represent
superimposed
infection, aspiration (as clinically questioned) or inflammatory
process.
4. Aortic atherosclerotic change.

[**2-20**] CXR:
FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient
has been
extubated and the nasogastric tube has been removed. The
extensive bilateral
parenchymal opacities, including the large apical fibrotic zones
with
extensive pleural thickening are unchanged in extent and
severity. There is
no newly appeared parenc
