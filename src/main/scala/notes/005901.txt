Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1167**]
Chief Complaint:
shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
cardiac catheterization with drug eluting stent to left anterior
descending artery and balloon angioplasty to Diagonal artery


History of Present Illness:
43 year female with h/o DMT2, OSA, Asthma, and Dyslipidemia
presents from OSH for ASA desensitization before PCI. Patient
has had 6 month history of Left Chest Pain/Pressure that lasts
for a couple of minutes and is a [**7-23**]. It radiates to the right
chest. Associated with shortness of breath and recently some
diaphoresis and nausea. She states she used to walk about 2
blocks before the CP starts, but it has been progressively
getting worse as she must stop and rest quite a bit more with
progressively shorter distances. She also states that this chest
pain has begun to occur at rest. Prior to 6 months, she has
never had this episode before. She went to her PCP who then
referred her to get a Exercise Tolerance Test: she walked 6
minutes according to a standard [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]. Her isotope
study showed lateral ischemia.
She was then admitted yesterday to [**Hospital 487**] Hospital for a
cardiac cath performed today. ([**9-2**]) Her cath revealed a
proximal 80% long lesion, totally occluded Cx, occluded
diagnoal, mild RCA disease. LVEF reportedly 55%. Since the
patient has an ASA allergy associated with rash/angioedema/and
questionable wheezing (per patient), she was loaded with 600 mg
of plavix, 50 mg of atenolol and transferred here for asa
desensitization and further intervention.

.
ECHO: [**2166-9-4**]
The left atrium is dilated. Left ventricular wall thickness,
cavity size and regional/global systolic function are normal
(LVEF >55%). Transmitral and tissue Doppler imaging suggests
normal diastolic function, and a normal left ventricular filling
pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). There is no ventricular septal defect.
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
The diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels
are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally
normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral
regurgitation. There is no mitral valve prolapse. The estimated
pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is no
pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Normal regional and global biventricular systolic
function. No pathologic valvular abnormality seen.
.
Cardiac catheterization [**2166-9-3**]:
COMMENTS:
1- Limited selective coronary angiography confirmed the presence
of a
long mid LAD 80% stenosis with a totally and chronically
occluded long
diagonal branch (originates from the diseased LAD segment). The
LMCA had
mild plaquing and the LCX was chronically occluded in mid vessel
with
collaterals filling the OM2. The RCA was not engaged as it was
found to
be patent on earlier cath performed at OSH.
2- Limited resting hemodynamic assessment showed normal systemic

arterial BP (130/70).
3- Successful PTCA of the chronically and totally occluded
diagonal
branch with 20% residual ostial stenosis, TIMI 3 flow and no
dissection
or distal emboli.
4- Successful PTCA and stenting of the mid LAD with a 2.5x23 mm
Cypher
DES, postdilated to 2.75 mm. Final angiography whosed no
residual
stenosis with TIMI 3 flow and no dissection or distal emboli.
5- Sucecssful closure of the LCFA with a perclose Proglide
closure
device.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Two vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Sucecssful stenting of the mid LAD with a Cypher DES.
3. Successful POBA of the diagonal branch.
4. Sucecssful closure of the LCFA with a Perclose Proglide
closure
device.
5. Dual antiplatelet therapy (ASA and Plavix) for a minimum of
12 months
then ASA indefinitely.

CXR: [**2166-9-2**]
REASON FOR EXAMINATION: Chest pain after breast surgery.
The portable AP chest radiograph was reviewed with no prior
studies available for comparison.
  The study was obtained in lordotic projection. The heart size
is mildly
enlarged, which might be exaggerated by the lordotic projection
of the study.
The lungs are essentially clear. There is no pleural effusion or

pneumothorax. Mediastinal position, contour and width are
unremarkable. Impression: No acute cardiopulmonary findings.



Brief Hospital Course:
#ACS/CAD: Pt admitted for aspirin desensitization. No signs of
wheezes, rash or pruritis with aspirin dose. S/P cath with
Diffuse 3VD with DES to mid LAD and POBA to Diagonal. No further
SOB during hospital stay, pt was able to ambulate in halls
without difficuty prior to discharge.  CK's flat, no evidence of
prior MI or wall motion abnormality on ECHO. Started on
clopodigrel, metoprolol, simvastatin and full dose ASA. Pt will
need to take Aspirin and clopodigrel every day for at least one
year because of her drug eluting stent.

#Pump:No hx or symptoms of CHF. CXR clear, LS without crackles
and no peripheral edema. ECHO [**Last Name (un) **] preserved EF.

# Right Shoulder pain: Unclear precipitant. Developed after
cardiac catheterization. No similar pain PTA, no obvious trauma
or strain. Worse with movement and palpation at bicep area.
Right shoulder somewhat diffusely swollen and tender but [**Male First Name (un) **] and
pain decreased prior to discharge. Better with narcotics and
ice. Right shoulder films showed no fracture. EKG and CK's
stable, not thought to be cardiac related.
Pt told to f/u with her PCP if right shoulder pain continues.

# Dyslipidemia: Not on statin on admission, started on 80 mg
Simvastatin. See lipid panel above. pt will need LFT's checked
in 2 months and then at 6 months to assess for transaminitis.
Low fat diet discussed with pt. She will need reinforcement.

#Type 2 Diabetes :Glargine and Humalog cont, metformin held
because of contrast load. Pt told to restart metformin on
[**2166-9-6**]. No changes at d/c.

#Asthma:  Home medications of Singulair
