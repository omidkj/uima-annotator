History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 69-year-old gentleman who was admitted to the
medical service on [**11-1**] with anemia and melena. He has a
history of end-stage
renal disease secondary to complications from diabetes and is
on hemodialysis. He reported 2 prior significant episodes of GI
bleeding, one in [**2168-10-17**] for which he received 5 units and
no source was found, and another in [**Month (only) 956**] of this year in
which no source was found. At the time of this GI bleed, upper
endoscopy was performed, and this revealed evidence of a 6 cm
submucosal mass in the
antrum of the stomach with central ulceration and stigmata of
recent bleeding. This was felt to be consistent with a GI
stromal tumor or leiomyoma and was felt to be the source of
bleeding. No other abnormality was noted in the esophagus,
stomach or first 2 portions of the duodenum.

Preoperative CT scans of the chest, abdomen and pelvis showed
a well-defined mass in the antrum with attenuation consistent
with fat. On further questioning, the patient does note a
recent history of early satiety without weight loss. He
states that this has progressed over the last several months

bowel sounds.  He was guaiac positive.  There was no edema in
his extremities.  Distal pulses were diminished.  The left upper
extremity fistula had good thrill and bruit.

[**2169-11-8**] PATHOLOGY REPORT:  Submucosal gastric lipoma.

Brief Hospital Course:
Upon admission, the patient was made NPO and given IV fluids.
He was then transfused several units of pRBC's to maintain his
hematocrit to be near 30. A CT scan of this abdomen revealed a
48 x 38 mm rounded, well-defined mass in the antrum of the
stomach.  He was then taken to the operating room to have the
mass removed, which was confirmed to be mucosal lipoma by
pathology.  He tolerated the surgery, but post-operatively, he
had several bouts of nausea and vomiting.  An upper GI with
small-bowel follow through showed no obstruction up to the
mid-portion of the jejunum.  It was decided that the study was
sufficient because inorder to study up to the terminal ileum,
the patient had to swallow a much greater amount of barium at
the risk of aspiration.  Although slow, the patient's nausea and
vomiting did eventually resolved and he was able to tolerate a
regular, low salt diet.  While in hospital, he maintained his
hemodialysis schedule of M/W/F.  At time of discharge, he was in
stable/good condition.
