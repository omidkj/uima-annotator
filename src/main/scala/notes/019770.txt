Chief Complaint:
R toe pain

Intubation and extubation x3


History of Present Illness:
79M with history of DMII, CAD s/p MI, PVD, COPD, hyperchol, HTN
who was  admitted to the Vascular Surgery service from his
cardiologist's office with ~ 1 week of R second toe pain. He had
seen his cardiologist on the day of admission for this complaint
and his cardiologist advised him to go to the hospital for
evaluation because he felt his exam at the time was consistent
with ischemia vs. cellulitis. Given both his history of DM type
II and CAD/PVD, the patient was admitted for IV antibiotics and
further workup of his R toe pain.

STUDIES:
PFTs ([**2132-3-14**]): FVC 2.58 (77%), FEV1 1.83 (83%), FEV1/FVC 107%,
MMF 1.09 (52%)
.
Foot X-ray ([**4-21**]): no bone erosion
.
Arterial Duplex ([**4-21**]): Extensive plaques involving the left
common carotid artery and bilateral internal and external
carotid arteries with significant stenosis at left internal
carotid artery, 80-99%, common carotid artery, 60-69%, and right
internal carotid artery, 70-79%. Retrograde flow in the left
vertebral artery indicating left subclavian steal, Significant
bilateral iliac, superficial femoral artery and tibial disease.

.
Carotid US ([**4-21**]): Extensive plaques involving the left common
carotid artery and bilateral internal and external carotid
arteries with significant stenosis at left internal carotid
artery, 80-99%, common carotid artery, 60-69%, and right
internal carotid artery, 70-79%
.
MRA LEs ([**4-22**]):
1. Moderate-severe atherosclerotic disease of the right common
iliac artery, including a focal high-grade stenosis
approximately 2.6 cm distal to the aortic bifurcation. There is
also moderate-severe disease within the right external iliac and
right common femoral arteries.
2. Occlusion of the distal right common femoral artery and
proximal right superficial femoral artery which extends for
approximately 5 cm. The right profunda femorus artery is patent
and supplies collateral vessels to the more distal right SFA.
3. Diffuse moderate-severe disease of the right superficial
femoral artery, with multiple focal stenoses identified. The
most high-grade disease is in the region of the adductor canal,
focally. The right below-knee popliteal artery od a good quality
vessel, and there is normal 3- vessel runoff to the foot.
4. Moderate disease of the left common iliac artery with
multiple focal stenoses identified.
5. Moderate-severe disease of the left superficial femoral
artery, with multiple focal stenoses identified. The most severe
disease is in the region of the adductor canal.
6. Normal 3-vessel runoff on the left.
.
CXR ([**4-23**]): New moderate-sized left and probable small right
pleural
effusions. Dedicated PA and lateral chest radiograph may be
helpful for initial further assessment when the patient's
condition permits
.
CXR ([**4-24**]): Perihilar and basilar opacities are likely due to
pulmonary edema. Pneumonia is considered less likely.
.
Chest CTA ([**4-24**]): Similar lymphadenopathy in the mediastinum. No
evidence of pulmonary embolism. Areas of air trapping,
ground-glass opacity and slight peripheral septal thickening,
suggesting pulmonary venous hypertension or mild congestive
heart failure, and perhaps obstructive pulmonary disease as
mentioned in the requisition. Increased left effusion. Calcified
posterior wall of left ventricle, unchanged
.
Head CT ([**4-24**]): No evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage or
other acute process.
.
ECHO ([**4-25**]): Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly
to moderately depressed with inferior akinesis and basal
infero-septal and infero-lateral hypokinesis. EF 40%. Inferior
akinesis and basal infero-septal and infero-lateral hypokinesis

.
CXR ([**4-27**]): Interval improvement in right middle and upper lobe
opacities, likely representing improved pulmonary edema
.
CXR ([**4-28**]): Worsening pulmonary edema with moderate bilateral
pleural
effusions. No pneumothorax.
.
CXR ([**4-30**]): Endotracheal tube is 8 cm above carina. NG tube is in
proximal body of stomach. Left subclavian CV line has tip
located in region of cavoatrial junction. No pneumothorax. There
is a left pleural effusion with associated atelectasis in the
left lung zone, unchanged since the prior film of [**2135-4-28**].
.
CXR ([**5-1**]): The superior portion of the chest is obscured by the
flexed neck and chin. Tip of endotracheal tube is difficult to
localize on this film, as is the NG tube. There is a left
pleural effusion and ill-defined opacity in the left lower zones
consistent with associated atelectasis. Left subclavian CV line
has tip in region of cavoatrial junction. No definite
pneumothorax. Repeat
film may be obtained for better localization of endotracheal
tube and NG tube if clinically indicated.
.
CXR ([**5-3**]): No endotracheal tube present. Nasogastric tube ends
in a mildly distended stomach. Small bilateral pleural effusions
improved substantially since [**5-1**]. Borderline interstitial
edema, improved. Heart size normal. Left subclavian central
venous line tip projects over the superior cavoatrial junction.
No pneumothorax. Status post right upper rib resections.
