CT ([**2190-2-26**]):
1) Bibasilar infiltrates consistent with pneumonia.
2) Cecal colitis, which is likely due to c diff. given the
patient's recent antibiotic course. Other less likely etiolgies
include cecal diverticulits, ischemia or neoplasm. Follow up CT
scan is recommended to exclude neoplasm in the area.
3) Intra and extra hepatic biliary ductal dilatation with low
attenuations
within the pancreas. To evaluate for IPMT an MR is recommended.
3) Bilateral renal cysts.
4) Questionable wall thickening within the cecum vs. fecal
material and lack of contrast distention.

MRCP ([**2190-2-28**]): 1) Mild intra and extrahepatic biliary ductal
dilatation without definite enhancing mass or calculus related
to the biliary tree. There is associated mild dilatation of the
pancreatic duct. This could be related to ampullary stenosis
which can be seen following chronic pancreatitis.
2) Unusual serpiginous fluid attenuation structure along the
anterior inferior margin of the liver, probably a biliary duct
with a more central stricture. Please see comments above.
3) Possible dominant dorsal pancreatic duct. 1.4 cm cystic
structure within the pancreatic head communicating with the duct
of Wirsung, which most likely represents sequela of chronic
pancreatitis and less likely IPMT.
4) Colitis. Unchanged since the CT scan.
5) Please refer to the MR angiography report of the previous day
for details on the vascular structures.

CT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST ([**2190-3-6**]):
1. Unchanged appearance of small, bilateral pleural effusions.
2. Stable appearance of previously described cecal colitis
without evidence of free air or obstruction.
3. Stable mild biliary ductal dilatation.
4. Unchanged appearance of pancreatic and renal cysts.
5. Stable appearance of 3.6-cm infrarenal abdominal aortic
aneurysm and aneurysmal dilatation of the right femoral artery.

Bx of Colon [**2190-3-10**]: Chronic active colitis with ulceration and
prominent granulation tissue.

Path from surgery [**2190-3-15**]: Ileum and proximal resection margin:
No diagnostic abnormalities recognized.  Appendix: No diagnostic
abnormalities recognized.  Colon: a) Cecal chronic active
colitis, with mucosal-submucosal ulcers; focal deep mural
inflammation, abscess formation, and fibrosis (slides S and T);
extensive serosal fibrosis and adhesions. b) Distal colon and
distal resection margin: No diagnostic abnormalities recognized.
c) Sampling of pericolic lymph nodes (23): Reactive changes. d)
No granulomas or fistulas identified. e) No thrombi,
atheroemboli, or primary vasculitis identified.

CT abdomen [**2190-3-24**]: 1) Multiple abscesses within the right
abdomen and pelvis.
2) Findings consistent with a post-ileus.
3) Small bilateral pleural effusions.
4) Stable mild biliary ductal dilatation.
5) Stable pancreatic and renal cysts.
6) Stable infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm and aneurysmal
dilatation of the right femoral artery.
7) Pigtail catheter placed in large intra-abdominal fluid
collection

Fistulogram/Sinogram [**2190-3-29**]: No fistula identified between the
abscess cavity within the right lower quadrant and the bowel.

CT Abd [**2190-4-1**]: Overall, the appearances show marked improvement
in the large collection on the right flank. A deep pelvic
collection is seen, unchanged or marginally smaller in size from
previous.  An ectatic aorta is seen, with stable infrarenal
aneurysm and stable aneurysm of the right SFA.  There is now an
increase in the amount of anasarca and pleural effusions.

Sinogram [**2190-4-7**]: Pig-tail catheter seen positioned within the
abscess cavity in the right lower quadrant, which appears
similar to the abscess cavity seen on recent CT scan from
[**2190-4-1**].

Brief Hospital Course:
73 y/o female with PMH significant for CAD s/p CABG in [**2169**] and
relook cath in [**3-/2187**]; GERD; and hypercholesterolemia admitted
with abdominal pain. Pt was hypotensive following taking several
SL NTG at home for "chest pain" and did not respond initially to
fluid resucitation.

Pt's right lower quadrant pain was associated with rebound and
gaurding since admission. Pt initially declined surgical
intervention, so she was managed expectantly (NPO, IVF,
antibiotics, serial abdominal exams). CT scans on admission and
repeated [**3-6**] indicated cecal colitis of unclear etiology
(infectious v. ischemic); colonoscopy on [**2190-3-10**] confirmed
ischemic colitis, and pt was scheduled for R colectomy on [**3-15**].
The procedure itself was uncomplicated, and is further detailed
in the operative note dated [**3-15**] dictated by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].

Of note, the pt was ruled out for MI on admission. During her
admission she continued to complain of intermittent L arm
heaviness not associated with CP; serial EKGs were unchanged and
cardiac enzymes were negative. Cardiology was consulted and
recommended transfusing to maintain Hct above 30; pt received
several units of blood and was noted on [**3-26**] to have converted
to [**Doctor Last Name 5239**] antibody positive, indicating that she would be very
likely to have a hemolytic transfusion reaction; thus no further
transfusions were administered.  She was advised to have a
postop echo and continue ASA and statin.

Postoperatively the pt's course was complicated by the
following:
1. Ileus: resolved by POD#7
2. Sepsis/Intra-abdominal abscess:  MRSA+, treated with Vanco.
Two abscesses located on CT, the more superficial andn larger of
which was addressed with placement of
