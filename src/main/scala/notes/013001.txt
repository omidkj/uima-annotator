Service:  CT Surgery

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname 34164**] is a 70 year old
male with no cardiac history prior to [**2138-7-29**], when he
had an acute myocardial infarction while on a hunting trip in
[**State 1727**].  He was admitted to a local hospital and received TPA.
He was subsequently discharged to home.  An echocardiogram at
that time showed inferior and posterior as well as basal and
septal ischemia and he was referred for cardiac
catheterization.  He then received two crown stents to the
right coronary artery and an [**Doctor First Name 10788**] stent to the left anterior
descending artery.

The patient did well after the intervention and was scheduled
for an elective knee surgery in [**2141-1-26**] but, before his
surgery, he began to develop symptoms of chest discomfort.
He consequently underwent another cardiac catheterization in
[**2140-12-29**], which showed branch vessel coronary artery
disease, mild mitral regurgitation and mild diastolic
ventricular dysfunction with an estimated left ventricular
ejection fraction of 55%.  He was medically managed since
then.

The patient is active daily.  For the past few months prior
to admission, he noticed increasing mild chest burning when
he is exerting himself.  This discomfort is relieved with
rest.  He sometimes needs to use nitroglycerin spray to
relieve his symptoms.  The patient's most recent
echocardiogram was in [**2142-5-28**].  He exercised 15 minutes of
[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] protocol.  He did experience chest discomfort with
exercise, but his electrocardiogram was nondiagnostic.
Imaging at the time revealed a mild fixed inferior defect but
no areas of ischemia, with an estimated left ventricular
ejection fraction of 45%.

Given the increasing symptoms of chest pain on exertion, the
patient underwent another cardiac catheterization prior to
admission, on [**2142-8-30**].  This cardiac catheterization
showed three vessel disease and left main coronary artery
disease with normal left ventricular function and moderate
diastolic dysfunction.  Specifically, the left main coronary
artery showed a 70% to 75% stenosis of the distal segment.
The left anterior descending artery showed a 50% proximal
stenosis and the circumflex artery had minimal irregularities
without significant flow limited lesions.  The right coronary
system had a 30% stenosis of the proximal segment.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  The patient denied any symptoms of
orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, claudication, edema
or lightheadedness.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1.  Hypercholesterolemia.  2.
Diabetes mellitus.  3.  History of smoking.  4.  Myocardial
infarction in [**2138-7-29**], treated with TPA.  5.  Left
anterior descending artery stents and right coronary artery
stent in [**2137**].  6.  Severe degenerative joint disease.  7.
Prostate cancer treated with Lupron.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  [**2141-1-26**], bilateral knee
replacements.

ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Toprol XL 100 mg p.o.b.i.d.,
Lipitor 60 mg p.o.q.d., aspirin 325 mg p.o.q.d., Motrin 800
mg p.o.q.d., iron 325 mg p.o.b.i.d., multivitamins one
p.o.q.d., Zestril 10 mg p.o.q.a.m. and 5 mg p.o.q.p.m.,
Glucovance as per instructions.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient works as a plumber.  He is
married.  The patient has a history of smoking.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On physical examination, the patient
was awake, alert and oriented times three, in no acute
distress, healthy looking elderly male.  He was afebrile with
a heart rate of 60, blood pressure 132/72, and oxygen
saturation 99% in room air.  Head, eyes, ears, nose and
throat:  No bruits, no jugular venous distention.  Lungs:
Clear to auscultation bilaterally.  Cardiovascular:  Regular
rate and rhythm, II/VI systolic ejection murmur at the apex,
normal S1 and S2 sounds.  Abdomen:  Soft, nontender,
nondistended, right groin without hematoma, no oozing, no
bruits status post cardiac catheterization.  Extremities:  No
edema, pulses palpable bilaterally.

LABORATORY DATA:  Admission hematocrit was 31.6, white blood
cell count 6.7, platelet count 179,000, prothrombin time
12.6, partial thromboplastin time 27.7 and INR 1.1.
Urinalysis: Negative.  Glucose was 174, BUN 27, creatinine
0.7, sodium 136, and potassium 4.6.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the cardiac
surgery service.  His last cardiac catheterization performed
on the day of admission showed 70% stenosis of the left main,
50% stenosis of the left anterior descending artery and 30%
stenosis of the right coronary artery with an estimated left
ventricular ejection fraction of 60%.

At the time, it was decided that a surgical intervention
would be appropriate given three vessel coronary artery
disease.  On [**2142-8-31**], the patient underwent coronary
artery bypass grafting times two with a left internal mammary
artery to the left anterior descending artery and reverse
saphenous vein graft from the aorta to the obtuse marginal
coronary artery.  The procedure was without any
complications.  Please see the full operative report for
details.

The patient remained intubated and tolerated the procedure
well.  He was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit in good
condition.  The patient remained in sinus rhythm with
occasional premature ventricular contractions.  He continued
to make adequate urine.  He was originally put on an insulin
drip given his history of diabetes.  The patient was started
on a diuretic regimen, to which he responded well.

Physical therapy was consulted, who followed the patient
throughout his hospitalization.  On postoperative day number
two, the patient had a fever of 101.3.  His physical
examination remained unremarkable.  His incision was clean,
dry and intact.  He was started on Lopressor.  His hematocrit
was 26.8 on postoperative day number two.  His chest tube had
a small air leak.  The patient's insulin regimen was
tightened to gain better control of blood sugar levels.

On postoperative day number two, the patient was transferred
to the regular floor in stable condition.  He remained
afebrile with a stable heart rate and blood pressure and
adequate oxygenation.  The patient was ambulating with
assistance.  His chest tube and pacing wires were removed as
was his urine catheter.  The patient was cleared by physical
therapy to go home when medically ready.  The patient
remained in sinus rhythm without any events.  He was
discharged to home on [**2142-9-5**] in stable condition.
