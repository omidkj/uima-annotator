Service: NEUROLOGY

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 8850**]
Chief Complaint:
Unsteady gait, worsening mental status, and fatigue.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Lumbar puncture.

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] speaks very little English, and an interpreter was
unable to be obtained, therefore the details of the HPI have
been obtained from the neurology note of earlier tonight. Mr
[**Known lastname **] is a 75-year-old man with stage IIIA non-small cell lung
cancer metastatic to the brain, as well as prior stroke, who
presents with progressive fatigue, depression, and about 1 week
of unsteady gait. His cancer has been treated with seven weeks
of weekly carboplatin/Taxol with radiation followed by resection
[**2147-3-28**]. He underwent Cyberknife [**2148-3-14**] for his brain
metastasis, and subsequently had resection of radiation necrosis
on [**2148-7-12**].

He was referred to the ED by his visiting nurse and his wife,
who report progressively worsening gait with multiple falls over
the last week. He has additionally had incontinence, thought
secondary to inability to get to the bathroom in time. He has
also noted some increased weakness of the right arm and right
leg, along with some episodes of right arm jerking at night with
left arm extension. Of note, his decadron was decrased from 4 mg
daily to 2 mg daily last week.

On arrival to the ED, his vital signs were temperature 96.8 F,
heart rate 81, blood pressure 134/77, respiratory rate 16, and
oxygen saturation at 98% on room air. He had a head CT that did
not demonstrate any change from prior.  Neurology was consulted
and recommended a head MRI which he was unable to get secondary
to inability to answer questions about his medical history.

Past Medical History:
ONCOLOGIC HISTORY: He was initially presented with progressive
cough; found to have a spiculated nodule on CXR. Non-small cell
lung cancer, stage IIIA, diagnosed in [**2-17**]. Pathology
demonstrated metastatic carcinoma in [**7-17**] lymph nodes. He
underwent weekly carboplatin and Taxol chemotherapy with
radiation therapy for seven weeks followed by surgery on
[**2147-3-28**]. He developed brain metastases and had Cyberknife
radiosurgery to a left medial frontal metastasis
on [**2148-3-14**] to 1,800 cGy, and then resection of radiation
necrosis by [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], M.D. on [**2148-7-12**].

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
(1) Coronary Artery Disease: He is status post ST elevation MI
in [**11-15**] with stent to the left circumflex artery at the [**Hospital1 3343**].
(2) Congestive Heart Failure: His last echo in [**1-16**] with mild
regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with mild basal
inferior and inferolateral hypokinesis (EF 50-55%).
(3) Stroke: Small CVAs noted on head CT at [**Hospital1 1774**] in [**11-15**]
(4) Deep Venous Thrombosis: This was diagnosed shortly after his
hospitalization for MI; he is on Coumadin.
(5) Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation: He was diagnosed during
admission for MI. He had a negative bubble echo after old small
CVA's noted on head MRI.
(6) s/p IVC filter

Social History:
He is originally from [**Country 651**], Cantonese speaking. He is retired.
He worked a variety of jobs, including in restaurants. He lives
with wife and one of his sons. [**Name (NI) **] has three children. He is a

Family History:
His father and mother had CAD.

Physical Exam:
VITAL SIGNS: Temperature is 99.1 F, blood pressure is 155/95,
heart rate is 87, respiratory rate is 18, and oxygen saturation
is 98% in room air.
GENERAL:  Well appearing overweight Asian male, easily
arousable, resting comfortably in bed. He has an inappropriately
bright affect with smiling throughout interview. He follows all
commands. He does not always answer questions appropriately;
however this may be the language barrier.
HEENT: Moist mucous membranes.
CARDIOVASCULAR: RR, normal rate, no murmurs.
LUNGS:  Clear bilaterally.
ABDOMEN:  Normoactive bowel sounds, soft, non-tender.
EXTREMITIES:  No edema.

NEUROLOGICAL EXAMINATION: His Karnofsky Performance Score is 50.
He is awake, alert, and oriented times 3. His language is fluent
with good comprehension. He has mild psychomotor slowing.
Cranial Nerve Examination: His pupils are equal and reactive to
light, 3 mm to 2 mm bilaterally. Extraocular movements are full.
Visual fields are full to confrontation. His face is symmetric.
Facial
sensation is intact bilaterally. His hearing is intact
bilaterally. His tongue is midline. Palate goes up in the
midline. Sternocleidomastoids and upper trapezius are strong.
Motor Examination: He does not have a drift. His muscle
strengthsare [**6-15**] at all muscle groups. His muscle tone is
normal. His
reflexes are 0-1 bilaterally. His ankle jerks are absent. His
toes are downgoing. Sensory examination is intact to painful
stimuli. Coordination examination does not reveal appendicular
dysmetria.

Pertinent Results:
STUDIES
EKG:  Normal sinus rhythm, left axis deviation secondary to old
inferior MI (inferior Q waves).  No acute ST/T changes.

CXR PA and LAT:  FINDINGS: PA and lateral chest: Right upper
lobectomy and radiation changes are unchanged from prior. The
heart is mildly enlarged but unchanged.  There is no evidence of
effusion, infiltrate or pneumothorax. The osseus structures are
unremarkable.

HEAD CT:  IMPRESSION:
1.  Stable left frontal lobe vasogenic edema. Underlying lesions
poorly assessed. No new area of edema or evidence of acute
intracranial hemorrhage.

Cytology: POSITIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS consistent with
metastatic carcinoma.

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 75-year-old man with metastatic non-small cell lung
cancer, CAD with prior inferior STEMI, CHF, prior stroke, and
DVT on coumadin, presented with 1 week of worsening mental
status, increased fatigue, and unsteady gait. While in the
hospital he was found to have leptomeningeal spread of his known
NSCLC.  He was also found to have likely NPH.

ICU Course:
Patient was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] from OMED after episode of
rigors s/p LP. LP with low glucose, elevated protein,
xanthochromia, 45 WBC with poly's. There was concern for status
epilepticus when initially presented. Dilantin loaded 1300 mg
IV. Started Dilantin 100 mg q8. Keppra to 1 gram IV BID.
Continued on decadron 4 mg [**Hospital1 **]. Started Vanc, ceftriaxone,
Acyclovir, and ampicillin for broad coverage for meningitis
given elevated BC from [**12-31**] over the course of the day, nuchal
rigidity and CSF results. Hypotensive episode to systolic 69
with dilantin, on levophed for a matter of minutes which
resolved. Pt continued to be somnolent with myoclonic jerks.
Unable to communicate, occasional eye opening. CT head with
metastasis with hemorrhage cerebellum. CSF on [**2148-11-8**] returned
with malignant cells. History and evidence consistent with
carcinomatous meningitis. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 724**] [**Name (NI) 653**] family with
discussion [**Name (NI) 3225**], home with hospice if possible. [**Name (NI) **] son who
