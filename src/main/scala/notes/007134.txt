History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 37212**] is a 45 y.o. Male with h.o. CML s/p allogenic
transplant, chronic GVH, bronchiolitis obliterans s/p recent
discharge for worsening dyspnea presented to the ED with hypoxia
and altered mental status.
.
On review of the pt's records it appears as if he was recently
admitted for a week for a LLL PNA, treated with a course of abx
and discharged yesterday. He was noted to have consolidation on
CT chest and was going to be treated at home with Levofloxacin
and home O2. Unfortunately he was not able to get his oxygen set
up and he was admitted for his dyspnea. During his admission it
appears he was altered, remarking on voices telling him things
per his wife. On review of OMR it appears he signed out AMA,
refused IV antibiotics, further evaluation for his altered
mental status and hypercarbia. He was discharged on a regimen of
Augmentin.
.
In the discharge plan available it appears family wanted him
home and thought he would be better in a more familiar
environment. At home though pt was noted to be altered,
specifically non-verbal at times; he would call his wife and
when she came to see him he would not say anything. His wife
decided to bring him back to the ED for further evaluation.
.
In the ED initial VS were noted to be BP 178/116, HR 130, Sat
91%. He underwent a CXR which showed LLL infiltration/effusion.
For his altered mental status he underwent a CT head which
showed an unchanged hypodensity on R fontal and a new 6 mm
hyperdense focus in the left temporal lobe, ?mets versus
hemorrhage. Neurology were consulted in the ED and determined
that his presentation could be infectious and recommended an LP
which was performed in the ED. Pt was started empirically on
Acyclovir, Ceftriaxone, Vanc, Flagyl.

Reports

[**3-19**] CTA:IMPRESSION:
1. No CTA evidence of a tracheal innominate fistula.
2. Marked interval worsening of bilateral pleural effusions with
compressive atelectasis and consolidations.
3. No evidence of high-grade stenosis, occlusion, or dissection
involving the extracranial arterial vasculature.
4. Incomplete evaluation of the intracranial arterial
vasculature
demonstrates no evidence of high-grade stenosis, aneurysm, or
arteriovenous malformation.
5. Stable calcifications and hyperdensity in the right temporal
and frontal lobes, likely representing prior radiation
treatment.
6. Scattered sclerotic densities within the bone marrow likely
secondary to metastases.
2/910 CXR:REASON FOR EXAMINATION: Respiratory failure, rising
white blood cell count.

Portable AP chest radiograph was compared to [**2155-3-15**].

The tracheostomy tip is approximately 3.5 cm above the carina.
The NG tube
tip passes below the diaphragm with its tip not clearly seen.
The right
central venous line tip is at the cavoatrial junction.
Cardiomediastinal
silhouette is stable. Bilateral pleural effusions are unchanged
as well as
moderate-to-severe pulmonary edema. The above-described findings
might
obscure infection and if clinically warranted further evaluation
with chest CT might be considered.

TTE [**2155-2-27**]:The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal
defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are
normal (LVEF >55%). There is no ventricular septal defect. The
right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with borderline
normal free wall function. There is abnormal septal
motion/position. The diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending
and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic
regurgitation. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with
trivial mitral regurgitation. There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There
is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2155-2-6**],
the heart rate is now normal and LVEF is normal. Moderate
pulmonary hypertension is detected.
