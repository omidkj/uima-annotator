CXR:
[**2148-12-3**]: Surgical material is again noted along the
inferolateral right chest wall. The amount of pleural fluid
tracking along
the right chest wall and into the medial right apex,
posteriorly, appears to have increased over several days.
Heterogeneous opacities at the right lung base are unchanged.
The left lung remains well aerated. There is no left pleural
effusion or pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is
unchanged.
IMPRESSION:
Apparent increase in right pleural fluid layering along the
lateral right
chest wall, and in a loculated collection at the posterior right
lung apex.
[**2148-11-29**]: Moderate right pleural effusion is again  seen that
tracks along the lateral chest wall and the major fissure. The
area of opacification at the right base remains constant. Left
lung is well aerated without evidence of definite effusion or
consolidation. Persistent cardiomegaly without evidence of
vascular congestion.
[**2148-11-27**]: Overall stable right pleural effusion and atelectasis
following
right chest tube removal with no pneumothorax or new
abnormality.
[**2148-11-26**]: some improved aeration bilaterally without evidence of
pneumothorax. Continued enlargement of the cardiac silhouette
with atelectatic changes at the bases. No evidence of pulmonary
vascular congestion.
[**2148-11-25**]: The large right pleural effusion may be
smaller in size, or fluid may have shifted to the medial
hemithorax.
Relatively diffuse opacity at the right lung base may represent
atelectasis.  There is no left-sided consolidation or pleural
effusion. There is no pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal
silhouette is grossly unchanged.

Echocardiogram: [**2148-12-2**]
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are
normal (LVEF >55%). The estimated cardiac index is normal
(>=2.5L/min/m2). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic
regurgitation. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with
trivial mitral regurgitation. There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There
is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. Normal
biventricular cavity sizes with preserved global and regional
biventricular systolic function.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 13646**] is 63 year-old male admitted following right redo
thoracotomy and chest wall hernia repair. He was extubated in
the operating room, and monitored in the PACU prior transfer to
the floor.  Once transfer to the floor he was found to be
hypovolemic with low urine output requiring large fluid
challenges.  On [**2148-11-27**] he was transferred to the TSICU for
hypotension, which he was given more fluids. He transfer back to
the floor in stable condition on [**2148-11-29**].

Respiratory: The patient required aggressive pulmonary toilet
with around the clock nebulizers.  He continued with his home
CPAP for OSA/COPD at night. Pulmonology followed him throughout
his hospital course. On [**2148-12-2**] it was felt he was volume
overloaded gently diuresed with good effect. He was weaned off
oxygen saturating mid 90's on room air. Goal oxygen saturations:
89-94%.

Chest tube was removed on [**2148-11-28**]. Followed by serial chest
films (see above report)

Cardiac: He was tachycardic in the ICU which responded to
Lopressor. On the floor he became hypertensive and his
tachycardia in low 100's persisted. An echocardiogram was done
and showed normal EF with moderate pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension of 45 mm Hg. His  home dose lisinopril of 40 mg po
bid was restarted and up titrated his metoprolol to 37.5 mg po
tid, with good effect.

GI: He had normal bowel movements and remained on proton pump
inhibitors.

Renal: He was hyponatremic with sodium of 126, which improved
with normal saline to 137.  Renal function remained within
normal range. The Foley was removed on [**2148-11-29**] once the
epidural was removed, and he voided well thereafter. He was
diuresed for volume overload on [**2148-11-29**] once and started daily
on [**2148-12-2**], with positive response in overall clinical status.

Endocrine: His blood sugar range varied 100-400.  [**Last Name (un) **] was
consulted and adjusted his insulin to maintain adequate glucose
control.

Pain: Epidural Bupivacaine and morphine PCA was initially used
for pain control. The was transition ed to MS Contin and
lidocaine patch for good pain control.  His pain improved on
[**2148-11-29**] the epidural and PCA were stopped.  He continued with
MS Contin and morphine immediate release for breakthrough pain.
