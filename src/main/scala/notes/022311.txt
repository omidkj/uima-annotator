EVENTS / HISTORY OF PRESENTING ILLNESS: The pt is a 89y/o M with
a PMH of CVA in [**2143**] with residual disordered breathing, DM type
2 presenting with four days of intermittent anterior chest
discomfort and hypoxia. The pt reports pain worse with feelings
of anxiety, has previously had similar pain while walking on a
treadmill. Denies prior dyspnea. Denied N/V, No cough. States he
works out daily by lifting weights, aerobic activity limited by
fatigue. He has noted increased fatigue over the past several
months. He has been off CPAP and nocturnal O2 for complex
disordered sleep. Pain is unchanged with changes in position of
deep breath.

In the ED, initial vitals were T: 98.0 HR: 88 BP: 140/85 RR: 18
O2Sat: 94% 4L NC. Patient received Morphine 2mg X3, NTG SL X2,
morphine 4mg X1, ASA 325mg, Lasix 40mg IV and heparin gtt was

Reports/Imaging
CXR IMPRESSION: Moderate-to-severe pulmonary edema. Small
bilateral pleural effusions. The study and the report were
reviewed by the staff radiologist.

[**2145-3-2**] TTE The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial septal
defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Overall left ventricular ejection fraction is normal
(LVEF 60%). However, the basal segments of the inferior and
posterior wall are akinetic, and the midventricular segments are
hypokinetic. There is no ventricular septal defect. The right
ventricular free wall is hypertrophied. The right ventricular
cavity is dilated with borderline normal free wall function. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Moderate to severe
(3+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The left ventricular inflow
pattern suggests a restrictive filling abnormality, with
elevated left atrial pressure. The tricuspid valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. The supporting structures of the tricuspid
valve are thickened/fibrotic. Moderate [2+] tricuspid
regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images
unavailable for review) of [**2145-2-12**], inferior posterior
left ventricular contractile dysfunction as well as right
ventricular dysfunction are now present. The mitral and
tricuspid regurgitation and pulmonary artery pressure are
significantly increased.

CTA IMPRESSION:
1. Diffuse bronchial wall thickening, measuring up to 4 mm in
the right main bronchus is new compared to prior CT study in
[**2139**] and could represent bronchitis.
2. Progression of emphysema.
3. Slow progression of basal fibrosis, might be consistent with
LIP or NSIP. Ground-glass opacitied in upper lungs are most
likely unrelated and are due to aspiration, infection or edema
(less likely).
4. Calcified hilar lymph node and calcified granuloma in left
lung base could represent prior exposure to granulomatous
disease.
5. Prominent bronchial arteries.
6. Large hiatal hernia.
7. Stable lung nodules measuring up to 7.6 mm in the right lower
lobe are
stable since [**2139-8-6**].
8. Compared to [**2139**], there is increase in size of mediastinal
and hilar lymph nodes, the largest one measuring 11.6 mm in the
left hilum. This enlargement could be reactive to the lung
process.

cardiac cath
COMMENTS:
1. Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system
demonstrated three vessel coronary artery disease. The LMCA had
no flow
limiting disease. The LAD had diffuse proximal calcification
with 60%
stenosis at its mid portion. The LCx had a total occlusion at
OM1
takeoff and then a long subtotal occlusion of OM1 - appears
chronic. The
RCA had diffuse 90% proximal and 80% distal disease, heavily
calcified.
2. Limited resting hemodynamic measurement demonstrated a normal

systemic arterial pressure at 133/67 mmHg.
3. Successful PTCA and stenting of the distal RCA with a 3.0
x 18mm Xience DES to distal RCA lesion at 12 atm, a 3.0
x 28mm Xience DES to the proximal at 14 atm and 3.0 x 8mm Xience
[**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **]
[**Last Name (Prefixes) 22595**] overlapping with first stent at 14 atm; final = 0%
stenosis,
TIMI 3 flow with no dissection.
4. Right femoral arteriotomy site was closed with a 6 French
mynx
device.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Successful placement of DES to RCA.
