Admission Date:  [**2172-1-20**]       Discharge Date:  [**2172-2-14**]

Date of Birth:   [**2113-12-31**]       Sex:  M

Service:  VASCULAR

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Unstable angina.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient was initially
admitted to the Medical Service and Cardiology for unstable
angina.  He underwent a cardiac catheterization, which
demonstrated three vessel disease.  He had an angioplasty
with stent placement of the left anterior descending coronary
artery times two at the mid and distal portion of the left
anterior descending coronary artery.  The patient tolerated
the procedure well.  This was complicated by a rectus sheath
hematoma.  Vascular surgery was consulted for further
treatment.Echocardiogram done on [**1-21**] showed a left
ventricular hypertrophy, moderate left ventricular cavity,
normal size, left ventricular systolic function, mildly
depressed with an ejection fraction of 30 to 35%.  A PMIBI
was done on [**1-29**], which demonstrated no electrocardiogram
changes or symptoms.  The nuclear scan showed moderate
reversible defect of the inferior wall severe partial
reversible defect of the apex and a fixed moderate defect of
the anterior wall with global hypokinesis.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY
1.  Open lung biopsy was a lung transplant.  When this was
done is not documented.
2.  History of heroine abuse on methadone.
3.  Diabetic on insulin.
4.  Recent community acquired pneumonia, treated.
5.  Chronic renal insufficiency with a baseline creatinine
between 1.9 and 2.1.
6.  Hypertension.

ALLERGIES:  Talwin and Codeine, manifestations unknown.

MEDICATIONS:  Prednisone 7 mg q.d. Prozac q.d., Methadone 95
mg q.d., Prograf 3 mg q.d., NPH and regular insulin b.i.d.,
Norvasc 5 mg q.d.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs blood pressure 117/70.
Pulse 99.  Respirations 30.  O2 sat 6 liters 95%.  General,
asleep, drowsy, white male.  HEENT examination was
unremarkable.  There is no JVD.  Chest examination showed
poor air movement bilaterally, but equal.  No rales.  Heart
is regular rate and rhythm with a 2/6 systolic ejection
murmur, which radiates to the axilla.  Abdominal examination
is unremarkable.  Extremities examination, right groin clean,
dry and intact.  He had a palpable dorsalis pedis pulses
bilaterally.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The Liver Service was consulted, because
the patient has undergone a liver transplant six years ago
for alcohol induced cirrhosis.  Their recommendations were to
continue the patient on his current immune suppression,
obtain blood cultures and serologies and AFP to rule out any
hepatoma, ultrasound of the liver with doppler of the veins,
once the patient has left the Coronary Care Unit.  He will
require a colonoscopy post discharge.  His FK506 level was
16.7.  Pulmonary was consulted, because of the CT and chest
x-ray showing dependent consolidation with small bilateral
pleural effusions and large ascus vein.  Given the findings
of his stress test, CT surgery was consulted.  They reviewed
the patient s catheterization films and felt he was not a
candidate for coronary artery bypass graft surgery.  On
[**2172-2-2**] the patient developed acute abdomen.  General surgery
was consulted.  CT of the abdomen was obtained, which showed
a large intraperitoneal hematoma of unclear source with
rectus abdominal muscle involvement.  The patient's heparin
was discontinued.  He was transfused for a hematocrit of 22.
Serial hematocrits were followed.  Vascular surgery was
consulted.  The patient underwent an exploratory laparotomy
on [**2172-2-3**] by the Vascular Service.  There was no acute
bleeding and the source of bleeding was not identified.  The
patient was placed on a perioperative Cortisone stress doses.
He was transferred to the CICU for continued monitoring and
care.  The patient was extubated on postoperative day two.
He remained hemodynamically stable.  His JP drains were
removed.

On postoperative day three the patient remained with a low
grade temperature at 99.3, defervesced to 97.3.  His
hematocrit remained stable at 31.3, BUN 73, creatinine 3.1.
His electrolytes were repleted as necessary.  Hydrocortisone
weaning was begun and the patient was transferred to the VICU
for continued monitoring and care.  His Swan Ganz catheter
was converted to a central line on [**2172-2-6**].  The patient
continued to show clinical improvement and on postoperative
day six was transferred to the regular nursing floor.  The
patient began ambulation on [**2172-2-10**].  He was evaluated by the
physical therapy department and felt that he would require a
skilled nursing facility to maximize his return to safe
independent functioning.  The patient was followed by the
Social Service for multiple social issues.  A speech and
swallow consult was requested on [**2172-2-11**], but the patient was
not cooperative.  The patient's abdominal staples were
removed on [**2172-2-12**].  The patient was tolerating po.  There
was no signs of aspiration. case management was requested to
begin rehab screening.

At the time of discharge the patient was in stable condition.
Lungs were clean, dry and intact.
