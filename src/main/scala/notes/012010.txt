.
Briefly, Ms. [**Known lastname 74916**] is a [**Age over 90 **] year-old woman with a history of
cervical spondylosis, lumbosacral radiculopathy and spinal
stenosis and old RBBB who presented 8 days prior to CCU transfer
after a fall at home with hip fracture. In the ED she was
hypotensive and had a left femoral cordis placed. She went
urgently to the OR on day of admission ([**3-10**]) for an ORIF. Her
post op course was complicated by a presumed hospital acquired
pneumonia (fevers, question of abnormal CXR, leukocytosis and
hypoxia) being treated with vancomycin and levaquin. She was
also hyponatremic after her surgery. She developed a fistula and
pseudoaneurysm at the site of her cordis, was evaluated by
vascular surgery and had a thromin injection on [**3-13**]. She had
b/l LE u/s to evaluate for ? DVT/PE in setting of fevers,
hypoxia, was negative on [**3-18**]. On [**3-16**] at approximately 5pm pt was
noted to go into a slow atrial flutter with rates 30-50s. For
the first 24-36 hours she was hemodynamically stable with a
normal BP. EP was consulted who recommended holding her nodal
agents, BB held. Today her blood pressures dropped to 80-100s
with an associated decrease in urine output for which she
triggered, increased 02 requirement to 4L and crackles on exam.
She was also noted to go into acute renal failure with an
increase in her creatinine from 0.9-1.4. She was given ~750cc
IVF with no improvement. She was transferred to the CCU for
further management of her hemodynamically unstable bradycardia.

.
On arrival to CCU, pt persistently bradycardic with HR 30-50s.
BP stabilized to low 100s. Was alert and oriented. Complained of
dizziness and difficulty breathing. Otherwise denied pain or
other complaints.

Brief Hospital Course:
[**Age over 90 **] f presents with femur fracture after a mechanical fall.
.
# Bradycardia: Patient had acute onset bradycardic overnight on
[**2167-3-17**].  Appeared to be in atrial flutter with poor conduction.
Nodal agents were discontinued EP Cardiology was consulted.
Ablation was discussed as an option but given patient's
concurrent pneumonia and other comorbities the decision was made
to wait on such a procedure until it would tolerated more
easily.  Patient was continued on lovenox for VTE prophyllaxis.
Initially bradycardia was thought to be asymptomatic.  However,
she began to develop complications of her bradycardia including
somnolence, shortness of breath, low urine output, and ARF
within 48 hours of onset.  At this point she was transferred to
the ICU for further management of her poor cardiac output.
Unsuccessful attempt was made to pharmacologically control
rhythm. Pt was desatting on NC, switched to NRB. Became
increasingly delirious. Heart rhythm progressed to complete
heart block, rate in 30s. Per family mtg with niece, pt made
CMO. Pt gradually expired.
.
#. R Femur fracture. Seen by ortho/trauma in ED, went to OR on
[**2167-3-10**] where her femur was surgically repaired. Patient's pain
was adequately controlled after surgery.  Patient was continued
on calcium and vitamin D.  Patient was started on lovenox [**Hospital1 **]
after it was determined that femoral
pseudoaneurysm/fistula/hematoma was stable. Physical therapy was
started.
.
#. AMS:  Patient experienced several episodes of confusion and
somnolence after her surgery which may be attributable to pain
medications. Infection may also be a significant contributor.
Pain medications were titrated and patient was started on
empiric treatment for hospital acquired pneumonia.  Patient
became bradycardic on [**2167-3-17**] and her somnolence subsequently
increased.
.
# Hospital Acquired Pneumonia: Patient reports recent pneumonia.
She developed increased oxygen requirements and increased sputum
production during her admission.  She was started on empiric
treatment for HAP with vancomycin and levoquin.  Patient was
given symptomatic relief with nebulizer treatments and chest PT.
.
#. Anemia. Microcytic. Hct down from 30 in [**2166-8-19**] to 20 on
admission. Guaiac positive stools. Colonoscopy in [**2165**] showed 3
sessile 3cm non-bleeding polyps in the cecum and a single
sessile 1 cm non-bleeding polyp of benign appearance was found
in the transverse colon. No large hematoma seen on CT.
