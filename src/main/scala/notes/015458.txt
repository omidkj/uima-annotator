Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 922**]
Chief Complaint:
chest tightness with exercise

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2194-2-28**] cardiac catheterization
[**2194-3-1**] cabg x2 (LIMA to LAD, SVG to OM)


History of Present Illness:
Pt is a 57 yo M w/ PMH of asthma, borderline HTN presenting from
[**Hospital3 **] after positive stress test with prolonged
anginal symptoms. He reports that he first noticed chest
tightness last summer during long bike rides, but simply cut
back and attributed it to aging. Then approx 3 months ago he
noticed that after walking on a treadmill or eliptical after [**3-18**]
minutes he noticed substernal chest tightness and shortness of
breath. He felt this was most likely related to his asthma and
increased his Flovent. This continued to happen and at that
point his PCP referred him for an exercise stress test today
where he was able to exercise 9 minutes but developed SSCP and [**Street Address(2) 58212**] depressions in the inferior lateral leads which did not
resolve until 15 minutes in recovery (was given 1 SL nitro). He
was sent to the [**Location (un) 620**] ED where his CPK was 114, MB 2, Trop
0.051. He was referred to [**Hospital1 18**] for cardiac catheterization
which showed 90% distal LMCA stenosis as well as 80% ostial
stenosis of both LAD and LCx. He was evaluated by cardiac
surgery and felt to be a candidate for urgent CABG.
.
Upon arrival to the floor, the patient was asymptomatic with no
chest pain or shortness of breath. He tolerated the procedure
well.

Cardiac catheterization:
1. Initial angiography in this left dominant circulation
revealed a 90% complex distal LM stenosis with extension into
both the
ostial Lcx and ostial LAD. The LAD had an 80% ostial lesion (in
continuum with the LM stenosis). The rest of the LAD was nromal.
The
ostial LCx had an 80% ostial stenosis (in continuum with the
LM). The
rest of the Lcx had minimal disease. The diagonals, Obtuse
marginals and
left PDA were free of significant disease. The RCA was a small
non-dominant vessel with minimal disease.
2. Limited hemodynamics revealed a central aortic pressure of
162/95.
The LVEDP was 6.
3. Left ventriculography in the [**Doctor Last Name **] projection revealed an EF of

approximately 45% and evidence of anterior wall hypokinesis

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Mildly depressed ventricular function.

Conclusions
PREBYPASS
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is
mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. There is mild
regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with mild
anterior and anteroseptal wall hypokinesis. LVEF~ 45%. The
remaining left ventricular segments contract normally. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There
are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. No aortic regurgitation
is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial
mitral regurgitation is seen.

POSTBYPASS
LV systolic function and regional wall motion abnormalities
remain unchanged from prebypass. The remaining study is also
unchanged from prebypass.
I certify that I was present for this procedure in compliance
with HCFA regulations.

RADIOLOGY  Final Report

CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2194-3-3**] 11:20 AM

CHEST (PA & LAT)

Reason: widened mediastinum post CT removal

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
57 year old man with post CT removal, had AP / shows
questionable widened mediastinum, reevaluate mediastinum
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
widened mediastinum post CT removal
PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST

REASON FOR EXAM: Assess widened mediastinum described in prior
study.

Comparison is made with prior study performed [**3-2**] at
20:00. This examination was performed [**3-3**] at 11:30.

Post-operative widened mediastinum is stable. There has been
interval worsening of left lower atelectasis and less in right
lower atelectasis. There are small bilateral pleural effusions.
Patient is post median sternotomy and CABG. Small
pneumopericardium is noted in the lateral view. Cardiac size is
normal.

IMPRESSION: Stable mild post-operative widened mediastinum.
Increase in bibasilar atelectasis, worse in the left side.
