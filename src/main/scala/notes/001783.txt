Chief Complaint:
hypoxia and confusion

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
77 y/o M with h/o CHF (EF= 40-45% on ECHO [**4-/2104**]), atrial
fibrillation on Coumadin presented to [**Hospital1 18**] as transfer from
[**Hospital6 5016**] in [**Location (un) 7661**], MA for further management of
hypoxia due to left upper lobe pneumonia and and ongoing
delirium due to previous aspiration pneumonia (right middle
lobe). The patient's current history starts [**2104-7-15**], when he was
hospitalized at [**Hospital1 18**] (requiring a brief ICU stay) for left
upper lobe pneumonia, treated with levofloxacin X7 day course.
He was discharged home with [**Hospital1 269**], but around [**7-25**] he started
having hypoxia (resting O2sat of 95%, ambulatory O2sat of 85%),
and also had cloudy urine. He was treated with Ciprofloxacin
X2-3 days for UTI, but because his hypoxia persisted and he had
progressively worse dyspnea, he was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**7-27**]. A
new right middle lobe infiltrate was noted on CXR during that
admission, which was felt to be an aspiration pneumonia. Patient
was evaluated by Speech and Swallow who felt he had silent
aspirations. He was treated with an 8 day course of broad
antibiotics (Vancomycin and Zosyn) which ended on [**2104-8-4**]. He
was discharged to [**Hospital3 **] on the 20th, but on the 21st
he was sent to the [**Hospital6 5016**] because his O2 sats were
down in the 80s. At the OSH, a CT chest was performed that
showed bilateral pulmonary fibrosis with brochiectasic changes
and a small acute infiltrate in the left upper lobe. Patient
received 4 days of levofloxacin IV. On the 24th, the patient and
his family requested transfer to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management of
his treatment because this is where he gets the majority of his
treatment.
.
Of note, the CTA chest from [**7-15**] states: "Extensive
consolidation involving the left upper lobe, could represent
infection. However, given the clinical history of elevated INR,
hemoptysis, and lack of symptoms of pneumonia, this could
represent pulmonary hemorrhage."
.
Also, since the patient's discharge from first admission, on
[**7-20**] there has been concerns regarding ongoing altered
mental status. For a while, the patient's wife had to have
friends take turns supervising him at home when she was out.
Geriatrics was involved during the patient's last [**Hospital1 18**]
admission for difficult to manage delirium which was felt
somewhat more consistent with that of acute brain injury.
Psychiatry at [**Hospital6 5016**] saw the patient during his
current admission and felt he was delirious from ongoing
hypoxia, and pulmonary disease. Prior to his presentation to
[**Hospital1 18**] on [**7-15**], the patient had been functional and travelling
through [**Country 18084**] where he climbed up to Edinburgh Castle.
.
Upon transfer to the [**Hospital1 18**], the patient was stable. When
interviewed, however, he was alert and oriented X2 but not
making much sense in his answers. When asked about his symptoms,
he would talk about his coming from [**Location (un) **] many years ago. He
did endorse trouble breathing and anxiety. The RN noted he
coughed up mucous with blood.
.
Review of systems:
Difficult to get an accurate ROS as patient's responses do not
make sense.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 77 year old man with CAD, CHF, who was admitted
with hypoxia and AMS. Respiratory failure worsened during his
hospital course despite treatments. He was made CMO and
terminally extubated on [**2104-8-27**]. The patient died at 7:03pm.

# HYPOXIA/DYSPNEA: The patient was transfered from OSH with
hypoxia and dyspnea. We began treatment of LUL pneumonia
empirically with levofloxacin (for CAP coverage), vancomycin
(HAP coverage), and cefepime (for pseudomonal coverage). On the
second day of hospitalization, levofloxacin was stopped and he
was continued on vanc/cef for total of a 14 day course.  Due to
the fact that his pneumonia was not improving since his original
diagnosis [**2104-7-15**], pulmonology was consulted. Urine legionella
was negative, LDH was elevated at 392.  A CT of the Chest on
[**8-9**] showed marked worsening of nonspecific multifocal
ground-glass opacities and consolidations predominantly
involving the left upper, right upper, left lower and portions
of the right lower lobes of infectious v. inflammatory v.
hemorrhagic etiology.  Bronchoscopy on [**8-14**] was grossly normal,
no signs of hemorrhage (only abnormality small nonobstructing
membrane extending about one-third of the way into the airway
lumen in the posterior segment of the left upper lobe).  BAL
showed hemosiderin-laden macrophages and multinucleated
histiocytes and was negative for malignant cells, PCP,
[**Name10 (NameIs) 18092**], and CMV, and was significant only for 1+ PMNs and
10-100K yeast, most likely colonizer).  Blood cultures were
negative x 5, HIV was negative, aspergillus negative, hepatitis
serologies were negative.  Infectious w/u was significant only
for a positive serum beta glucan (163), and at time of transfer
to the MICU cryptococcus and quantiferon gold were pending.
Inflammatory w/u negative for anti-GBM negative, complement
normal, ANCA negative, ESR elevated at 60.   He completed a 14
day course of vanc/cef without improvement in pulmonary status.
Repeat chest CT on [**8-17**] showed interval progression of
multifocal consolidations, likely representing infections,
although inflammatory condition is a possibility as well as new
small bilateral pleural effusions. He was again started on 40 mg
IV lasix daily with appropriate diuresis.  Infectious disease
was consulted on [**8-21**] and recommended
