Pertinent Results:
Echo [**2169-3-13**]: PRE-BYPASS: The left atrium is moderately dilated.
The left atrium is elongated. Mild spontaneous echo contrast is
seen in the body of the left atrium. Mild spontaneous echo
contrast is present in the left atrial appendage. The left
atrial appendage emptying velocity is depressed (<0.2m/s). No
thrombus is seen in the left atrial appendage. No atrial septal
defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is mild symmetric
left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size
is normal. Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. There are complex (>4mm)
atheroma in the ascending aorta. There are simple atheroma in
the aortic arch. The descending thoracic aorta is mildly
dilated. There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending
thoracic aorta. The aortic valve leaflets are severely
thickened/deformed. There is critical aortic valve stenosis
(valve area <0.8cm2). Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are moderately thickened. Trivial
mitral regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial effusion.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in person of the results at time of
surgery. A normal appearing coronary sinus is present.
POST-BYPASS: The patient is in sinus rhythm. The patient is on
no inotropes. Biventricular function is unchanged. There is a
well-seated, well-positioned bioprosthetic valve in the aortic
position. No paravalvular leak is seen. There is no aortic
regurgitation. There is a mean gradient of 14 mmHg at a blood
pressure of 96/46. The aorta is intact post-decannulation. No
other significant changes from prebypass exam.
.
CHEST X-ray: [**2169-3-16**] There is interval substantial decrease of
pneumomediastinum/pneumopericardium. Cardiac and mediastinal
silhouettes are unchanged including cardiomegaly. Left
retrocardiac consolidation and left pleural effusion are
unchanged as well as small right pleural effusion. There is no
pneumothorax. There is no evidence of pulmonary edema.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 80276**] was a same day admit on [**3-13**] when he was brought to
the operating room where he underwent an aortic valve
replacement. Please see operative report for surgical details.
In summary he had: Aortic valve replacement with 23mm [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Male First Name (un) 923**]
tissue valve. His bypass time was 73 minutes with a crossclamp
time of 55 minutes. He tolerated the operation well and
following surgery he was transferred to the CVICU for invasive
monitoring in stable condition. Within 24 hours he was weaned
from sedation, awoke neurologically intact and was extubated. On
post-op day one he was started on beta-blockers and diuretics
and transferred to the step-down floor.

Respiratory: aggressive pulmonary toilet, nebs and ambulation he
titrated off oxygen with room air saturation of 93-96%.

Cardiac: episode of brief atrial fibrillation rate control 60's
with spontaneous conversion to sinus rhythm with no further
ectopy.  Blood pressure stable 130-140 lisinopril 2.5 was
started [**2169-3-18**] and will titrated at rehab. Statin continued

GI: benign tolerated a diabetic diet.

Renal: gently diuresed with Lasix. renal function normal with
good urine output. Electrolytes were replete to maintain K > 4.0
& Mg 2.0.

Endocrine: Glargine and humalog insulin sliding scale were
continued to maintain blood sugars < 150.

Neuro: non-focal. Home dose Donepezil and Sertraline continued.

Disposition: He was followed by physical therapy who recommended
rehab.  He continued to make steady progress and was discharged
to [**Doctor First Name 391**] Bay [**Hospital **] Rehab [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 42508**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 80278**].
