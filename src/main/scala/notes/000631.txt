.
PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS: Allowing for marked kyphosis,
the cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable and within normal
limits. There is an elevated right hemidiaphragm with a small
amount of adjacent atelectasis. No areas of consolidation are
visualized. No effusions are appreciated. There is no evidence
of CHF. Patient positioning limits evaluation of the lung
apices.

There are no suspicious lytic or sclerotic osseous lesions.

IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary process.
.
COMPARISON: Abdominal angiogram [**2177-5-12**].

Multiple clips are within the right upper quadrant and a single
clip is overlying the right lower quadrant. There are several
loops of air-filled small bowel with no evidence of obstruction.
The descending colon is filled with stool, however, not
distended.

IMPRESSION: No evidence of obstruction.
.
ECHO:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric
left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is
mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with basal
and mid-inferior hypokinesis (c/w RCA disease). The remaining
segments contract normally (LVEF = 50%). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic root is
mildly dilated at the sinus level. The ascending aorta is mildly
dilated. The number of aortic valve leaflets cannot be
determined. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears structurally
normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is no mitral
valve prolapse. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure
is normal. There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
mild regional systolic dysfunction, c/w CAD. No significant
aortic valve disease seen.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2180-1-12**],
the findings are similar.


Brief Hospital Course:
Pt is a 74yo M with h/o CAD s/p MI and PCI to LAD [**2179**],
hypertension, type II diabetes mellitus, aortic stenosis,
paroxysmal atrial fibrillation on coumadin, non-healing left
foot ulcer for multiple years, who presents w/ c/o fever,
malaise, DOE and 1 episode of vomiting at presentation. U/A
indicating UTI as possible source of infection. Pt developed
a-fib with [**Hospital 26875**] transferred to MICU for rate control. He
converted to sinus within a few hours of arrival to the MICU
with rapid improvement in BP to baseline. Digoxin was
discontinued, and Metoprolol was increased to 25 TID.  He was
doing well at discharge.
.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM:
# Fever/Leukocytosis: Source likely urinary. Pt had initial O2
requirement and SOB at presentation. CXR showed no
consolidation. Pt is a chronic smoker w/ chronic cough, no h/o
asthma or documented COPD and he does not use inhalers at home.
Azithromycin was stopped given no pulmonary source. L foot ulcer
is stable with no e/o infection. Pt denies any symptoms to
suggest abdominal/GU source, vomiting on presentation resolved.
Patient was started on ciprofloxacin 10 day course.  Although
patient is on coumadin and had increasing INR, pt was reluctant
to change antibiotics. [**Hospital **] cx were negative and white count
remained stable.
.
# CAD: s/p MI in '[**79**] and stenting. CK peak 700, MB peak of 12,
trop peak 0.04 [**10-4**], but pt is chest pain free, no EKG changes.
Rise may have been [**12-24**] cardiac demand in setting of infection.
Pt had episode of chest pressure in setting of a-fib with RVR,
CE remained flat and symptoms resolved w/ rate control.
Continue daily ASA, lipitor, BB, but will hold [**Last Name (un) **] in setting of
lowish BPs. Echo was obtained which showed mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with mild regional systolic dysfunction,
c/w CAD. No significant aortic valve disease seen, EF 50%.
.
# HTN: patient on metoprolol and [**Last Name (un) **] as outpt.  [**Last Name (un) **] held in
setting of lower [**Last Name (un) **] pressures while in-house, furosemide also
held.  Will defer to PMD to restart medications as indicated.
.
# anemia: Hct drop since admission, BL 40s, may be dilutional
and pt has had lower Hct in setting of infection in past. No
clear source for bleeding. Hct was stable throughout this
admission.
.
# PAF: Patient in NSR on presentation. Supratherapeutic INR
while on ciprofloxacin. Pt was transferred to MICU for rapid
rate and had some chest pressure. Rate controlled with
metoprolol increased to 25mg TID. Patient was stable on
discharge.  His coumadin dose was decreased while he is taking
ciprofloxacin.  Antibiotic was not changed given good response
and patient's apprehension towards change. Patient's coumadin
dose will be adjusted per his PCP.
.
# DM: Continued outpatient NPH + ISS regimen.
.
# BPH: continued outpatient flomax.
