History of Present Illness:
   80 yo man w/ h/o HTN, hypothyroidism, CAD, and h/o GI bleed
presents as a transfer from [**Hospital 12017**] Hospital for ?HUS/TTP and
possible plasmapheresis.  Pt. and family reports to have been in
his usual state of health until [**2180-4-29**].   At that time, the
patient had LUQ abdominal pain, myalgias, and cold hands.  CT
scan done at that time revealed a moderate hiatal hernia and
diverticulosis.  A follow up CT scan done 6 weeks later revealed
possibility of SBO, but otherwise was unremarkable.
   Soon afterwards he was seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 58075**] (Rheumatology)
for worsening myalgias and LE edema.  He was felt to have a
variant of PMR, and was started on prednisone at 10mg PO QD.
Initially, his myalgias improved; however, he developed nausea,
vomiting, and diarrhea was re-admitted to the OSH on [**6-25**] for IV
hydration and antibiotics.  His N/V was thought to be [**1-31**] to
viral gastroenteritis and was discharged.
   In [**Month (only) 205**], Mr. [**Known lastname 58076**] had progressively worsening lower
extremity edema.  He was seen by Rheumatology (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 58075**] who
was concerned about possible pericardial disease.  A CT of the
thorax showed the possibility of interstitial fibrosis and a
pericardial effusion.  A TTE was performed which showed possible
aortic valve vegetation.  He was then admitted [**Hospital3 9947**] on [**2180-7-18**] for further evaluation of these findings by
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] (rheumatology) as well as his persistent lower
extremity edema, N/V/D.  During this admission, he underwent a
TEE, which showed only a small pericardial effusion anterior to
the RV without evidence of the aortic valve vegetation.  A
cardiac catheterization was performed, showing no evidence of
constrictive physiology.  Rheum felt that patient had only
limited scleroderma.  GI thought that diarrhea was possibly
secondary to bacterial overgrowth and recommended a course of
antibiotics.  Eventually, the pt's edema improved after lasix
and he was discharged on [**7-22**] with a 14 day course of
tetracycline.
   On [**7-24**], Mr. [**Known lastname 58076**] was re-admitted at [**Hospital 12017**] Hospital
because of progressively worsening weakness, N/V/D, and
arthralgias.  An exploratory laparocopy with small bowel biopsy
was performed for r/o partial SBO, which was seen on prior CT.
During his admission, the patient developed progressive anemia,
with Hct to 28.8.  In addition, his Cr has bumped from 1.8 to
4.4 and hemodialysis was begun today.  His platelets have also
dropped from 200 --> 64.  Total bilirubin was 2.5 on discharge.
No LDH or haptoglobin sent.  He continues to experience
persistent nausea, vomiting, and intermittent diarrhea.  He was
evaluated by renal at the OSH and a renal biopsy was performed
with results pending at this time.  He was also seen by
Rheumatology and the possibility of SLE was entertained. He was
started on IV steroids.  He was also seen by GI and Surgery for
work up of his persistent diarrhea.  A colonoscopy was
performed, which was negative and a small bowel biopsy was taken
(pending).  He was transfused one unit of pRBC on [**2180-7-31**] for a
hct of 28.8.
   On admission to [**Hospital1 18**], the patient continues to c/o nausea
when eating.  He describes decreased appetite due to nausea.  He
c/o slight abdominal pain in the area of his recent surgery.  He
is satting well; however, on 100% non-rebreather.

Brief Hospital Course:
80yo male patient admitted on [**2180-8-3**] with h/o N/V/diarrhea and
recent renal failure with thrombocytopenia. Appears to be
hemolytic anemia with + schistocytes and high bili/LDH. Highest
on differential would be TTP/HUS; more likely HUS given presence
of renal failure without fever or neuro symptoms (which would be
more c/w TTP). Another possibility for thrombocytopenia would be
HIT; however, this is less likely. Other less likely possibility
would be DIC; however, also unlikely given normal coags. ITP
unlikely in this gentleman as well.  Transfusion team & Hem/Onc
consulted and provided guidance in regards to the treatment of
TTP/HUS with plasmapheresis, which was initiatted on [**8-4**].  Pt
did not tolerate initial plasmapheresis with development of
hypotension, and he was subsequently transferred to the MICU for
use of pressors to support BP while continuing plasmapheresis.
Pt also requiring transfusion of blood products to maintain
blood counts.  Pt began to develop pulmonary edema with
increasing oxygen demand, treated with diuretics.  Subsequently
developed bilateral lung consolidation consistent with ARDS-like
picture vs pneumonia (also febrile) - started on antibiotics.
Pt developed respiratory distress & failure requiring intubation
on the morning of [**8-6**] by anesthesia - very difficult & prolonged
intubation requiring fiberoptics.  Pt also with acute renal
failure due to HUS/TTP & ATN which required hemodialysis for
fluid overload.  Pt developed enterococcus UTI which was treated
with antibiotics.  Pt was at one point able to be weaned off of
pressors & had rising platelet counts while receiving
plasmapheresis, with subsequent decrease in frequency of
treatments.  Pt had episode of emesis with development of
aspiration pneumonia, also discovered to have subcutaneous
emphysema & pneumomediastinum thought to be secondary to
bar
