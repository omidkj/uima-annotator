Admission Date:  [**2107-1-21**]       Discharge Date:  [**2107-2-11**]

Date of Birth:   [**2037-6-14**]       Sex:  F

Service:  VASCULAR

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Abdominal aortic aneurysm.

HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient was initially
evaluated by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in her office on [**2107-1-4**] who has a
past medical history of hypertension, hypercholesterolemia,
with a 5.5 infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm.  She denied
claudication secondary to that she does not walk enough to do
so and does not have evidence of rest pain in her lower
extremities.

She was deemed not suitable for intervascular repair of
extremely conical neck which was approximately 26 mm just
below the renal artery and over the course it was dilated to
29 mm.  She has been asymptomatic.  She is admitted for
aneurysm repair.  Carotid duplex were done prior to
undergoing surgery which showed minimal disease bilaterally
with 40-59% on the right and 40% on the left.  She denied any
back pain or abdominal pain.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Focus is a nontender
pulsatile mass of the abdomen.  She has a right paramedian
abdominal incision from prior cholecystectomy.  She has 2+
femoral pulses that are palpable and Dopplerable signals
distally.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the
Preoperative Holding Area where she underwent abdominal
aortic resection on [**2107-1-21**].  She required 2 units of packed
red blood cells and 3 units of CellSaver intraoperatively.

Postoperatively, she remained hemodynamically stable.  She
had Dopplerable pulses bilaterally.  Her postoperative
hematocrit was 34.  Her EKG was without acute changes.  A
chest x-ray was without pneumothorax.

An epidural was placed intraoperatively for analgesic
control.  The patient was transferred to the VICU for
continued monitoring and care.  She was followed by the Acute
Pain Service during the time that she had her epidural in
place.

On postoperative day number one, there were no overnight
events.  Her hematocrit remained stable at 34, BUN 25,
creatinine 2.1 up from 1.3.  Total CK 171, troponin less than
0.3, MB 4.  She continued with an epidural.  She continued to
be monitored.  She remained n.p.o.  There were no bowel
sounds on examination.  IV fluids were decreased and a Renal
consult was requested for increased creatinine.

Recommendations were to continue to hold the beta blockers
for a systolic blood pressure less than 120, although the
dopamine could be discontinued and continue monitoring of her
fluid balance was required.  Cardiology was requested to see
the patient because of some changes in her electrocardiogram.
With reviewing the electrocardiogram and the serial enzymes,
they did not feel that the patient had suffered an infarct
and continued treatment and management as we are doing.

The patient was transferred to the SICU on [**2106-1-23**] for acute
shortness of breath.  Her white count was 14.8, hematocrit
36.4.  BUN 28, creatinine 2.6, ALT 29, AST 116, alkaline
phosphatase 77, amylase 138, total bilirubin 0.2.  Total CPK
737, MB 12, MB index 1.6, troponin less than 0.3.

She was diuresed gently to maintain her liter negative over
24 hours and maintain her normotensive.  She remained in the
SICU.  Over this period of time, she did develop metabolic
acidosis which required IV infusion of soda bicarb.  Her
epidural catheter was discontinued on [**2107-1-23**] without event.
She was converted to IV/IM medication.

On postoperative day number five, her creatinine finally
plateau'd at 4.0.  The patient continued to show clinical
improvement and was transferred to the VICU for continued
care on postoperative day number six.

Her diet was advanced as tolerated on postoperative day
number six.  The abdomen was soft and nontender.  The wounds
were clean, dry, and intact.  The patient was evaluated by
Physical Therapy during this period of time and felt that she
would be able to go home once medically stable for discharge.

On [**2107-1-31**], the patient dehisced her abdominal wound and
required returning to the OR for exploration.  She tolerated
this well.  The patient was put on empiric vancomycin and
levofloxacin secondary to wound dehiscence.  Her renal
function continued to show improvement and her vanco was
dosed when level was less than 15.  She eventually passed
flatus on postoperative day number 14 and 4.

At the time of discharge, she was ambulating, tolerating a
soft diet.  Her white count was 12.0 and hematocrit 28,
platelets 500,000.  BUN 40, creatinine 1.7 down from 1.9.
She was discharged in stable condition.  She was passing
flatus, tolerating p.o.  TPN was weaned and discontinued.

FOLLOW-UP:  The patient is to follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in
two weeks time.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Bupropion 75 mg q.d.
2.  Sertraline 50 mg q.d.
3.  Amlodipine 10 mg q.d., hold for systolic blood pressure
less than 110, heart rate less than 60.

10. Dulcolax suppository p.r.n.
11. Fluconazole 200 mg q.d. for a total of seven days.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Abdominal aortic aneurysm, status post repair.
2.  Acute tubular necrosis with oliguric renal failure
secondary to hypotension, corrected.
3.  Respiratory metabolic acidosis secondary to underlying
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and renal failure,
corrected.
4.  Blood loss anemia, corrected.
