hypertensive gastropathy, GAVE, esophageal and rectal varices,
chronic gastritis, multiple cecal AVMs s/p cauterization,
multiple GIBs requiring >30 tranfusions over past 2 year who was
admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] [**10-24**] for scheduled redo CABG and MVR and
found to have an LV aneurysm on pre-op echo and pre-op Hct 16.
She was taken off the OR table and sent to the CVICU, where she
was transfused 4U pRBCs with appropriate response Hct 25. She
was transferred to [**Hospital1 1516**]. Capsule endoscopy was unremarkable. EGD
on [**2182-10-31**] showed Gastric varices, Angioectasias in the proximal
jejunum and mid jejunum (thermal therapy), Erythema with
erosions in the antrum compatible with gastritis and Varices at
the distal esophagus. She was discharged to home with a Hct of
26. Since her discharge on [**2182-11-2**], she reports being
asymptomatic at home. She denies recent CP/SOB/N/V/D, abdominal

clinic where she was found to have a Hct of 22. She was advised
by her GI doc to go to the ED.
.
In the ED, initial VS were:  Temp 96.8, HR 82, BP 120/48, RR 26,

STUDIES:
[**11-12**] ECG:  Sinus rhythm. Ventricular ectopy. The P-R interval
is prolonged. There are non-diagnostic Q waves in the inferior
leads. Diffuse severe ST-T wave changes. Compared to the
previous tracing of [**2182-10-8**] ST-T wave changes are more marked.

Brief Hospital Course:
=======================
BRIEF HOSPITAL SUMMARY
=======================
83F w/ CAD, 4+MR, CHF w/ 25% EF, HTN, and chronic GIB w/
transfusion dependant anemia [**1-30**] portal hypertensive
gastropathy, GAVE, esophageal and rectal varices, chronic
gastritis, multiple cecal AVMs presenting to the MICU w/ GIB and
low Hct.  The patient was given two units of pRBCs, and her Hct
increased appropriately and stayed relatively stable.  The
patient was evaluated by the GI team, who recommended an
outpatient capsule endoscopy study.  A palliative care consult
was initiated, and goals of care discussions were begun.

=======================
ACTIVE ISSUES
=======================
# GI Bleeding and Anemia: Patient has a history of chronic GI
bleeding requiring monthly transfusions and several hospital
admissions.  [**Month (only) 116**] be secondary to AVMs previously noted in
antrum, small bowel.  [**Month (only) 116**] also be secondary to gastritis, slow
bleeding from portal gastropathy (most likely).  The history
does not seem consistent with a variceal bleed.  BM black in
appearance, but complicated by iron supplementation.  No frank
bleeding or BM melenic appearing in last 48 hours of admission.
EKG upon admission demonstrated ST depressions and TWI
suggestive
