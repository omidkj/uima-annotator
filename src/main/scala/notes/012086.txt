Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1271**]
Chief Complaint:
nausea and headaches

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Right Crnaiotomy for tumor

History of Present Illness:
This is a very pleasant 65 year old male who has been
extensively worked up for nausea, vomiting, and headaches. This
has been going on for about six months. He is also reporting
problems with blurry vision, which is occasional, as well as
double vision sometimes. He had neuro-ophthalmology workup,
which
did not show anything abnormal. Also, no cataract. This started
happening about six months ago as well. Had a head CT done when
his gastroenterologist did not find anything abnormal from the
GI tract and revealed what seems to be primarily fatty tumor
over the right frontal base. An MRI was also done and further
characterized this lesion. A CTA was done for surgical planning.
He opted to proceed for surgery.

Past Medical History:
1. Diabetes.
2. Hypertension.
3. Hypercholesterolemia.
4. Acid reflux.
5. Sleep apnea, officially diagnosed in [**2186-3-24**], treated

8. Status post tonsillectomy.


Social History:
The patient is married with grown children.  He worked at the VA
for 28 years in food services and is also retired from [**Name (NI) **]
Brothers.  [**Name (NI) **] continues to smoke 6 cigarettes a day, and his
wife
is a smoker as well, as are a few of his children.  He does not
drink and denies asbestos exposure.


Family History:
NC

Physical Exam:
On Admssion: neurologically intact

On Discharge: neurologically intact

Pertinent Results:
MRI BRAIN [**2187-10-9**]:
Right frontal lobe mass, which appears to be extra-axial and on
the CT scan contains fat and calcium. Differential would include
a dermoid or a fatty meningioma.

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST [**2187-10-9**] (4PM):
Status post right frontal extra-axial mass resection with
slightly decreased mass effect. Blood products and gas in the
surgical bed. It is not clear whether linear hyperdensities
along the margins of the surgical bed represents calcifications
in the residual shell of the resected
mass, or iatrogenic material. The operative report is not
available for
correlation at the time of this dictation.

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST [**2187-10-9**] (8PM):
No significant change compared to [**2187-10-9**], at 4:25
p.m.

Chest X-ray [**2187-10-9**]
ET tube tip is 2.7 cm above the carina, the tip lies against the
right
tracheal wall. There are low lung volumes. Cardiac size is top
normal.
Bilateral pleural effusions are small. There is mild vascular
congestion.

EEG [**2187-10-10**]
This is an abnormal video EEG telemetry due to the presence
of 4 Hz background rhythm which represents a moderate to severe
encephalopathy such as can be seen in diffuse ischemia,
toxic/metabolic,
infectious, or other etiologies. It is also abnormal due to the
presence of right frontal slowing in the delta frequency range
such as
can be seen with subcortical dysfunction such as from ischemia,
trauma,
or mass, among other etiologies. Of note, there is significant
electrical artifact from 17:00 onward in the right hemisphere
leads.
There were no clear epileptiform discharges or electrographic
seizures
noted.

Chest X-ray [**10-14**]
Mild interstitial edema has progressed accompanied by some
increase in
pulmonary vascular congestion. Mild cardiomegaly is unchanged.
New
opacification at the right lung base could be pneumonia or
pleural effusion, statistically it is most likely atelectasis.
No pneumothorax. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 17597**] was paged.






Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 73193**] was taken to the OR on [**10-9**]. He had a right
craniotomy for tumor resction. Frozen section was dermoid or
epidermoid tumor. While in the PACU he demonstrated generalized
tonic-clonic seizure activity and was given Dilantin (300 mg
boluses) along with Ativan PRN. He was extubated following his
case, but required re-intubation when seizure to protect his
airwya. He required nicardipine for a SBP goal < 140. He was
getting Dilantin, decadron and his home medications. Post-op CT
head showed post-surgical changes reflective of removal of his
dermoid tumor. The patient had a repeat CT head 4 hours later on
[**10-9**] given his seizure activity, which noted no significant
changes. The patient was transfered to the TSICU while still
intubated for further monitoring. Frequent neuro exams were
attempted off propofol infusion, although seizure activity
resumed. It should be noted that the patient's left upper
extremity IV access site showed signs of infiltration and his
left extremity turned mottle and blue in appearance, concerning
for compartment syndrome in the PACU post-operatively. The
plastic surgery team felt the pressures were not consistent with
compartment syndrome and recommended arm elevations and warm
compresses which seemed to improve the swelling.

On [**10-11**] the patient had an EEG which demonstrated no seizure
activity. The patient was weaned from sedation in order to
optimize the neurologic exam. The patient was started on a
Nicardipine gtt for blood pressure control. Dermatology was
consulted about the patient's left extremity, they had few
additional recommendations to what plastic surgery recommended.
The patient had a much improved neurologic exam on [**10-12**] and the
patient's sedation was weaned. The patient was successfully
extubated on [**10-13**], and the patient was doing well
neurologically with no focal deficits.

He was doing well on the floor with daily dressing changes for
his arm with nursing. He had no further seizures. He required a
lot of insulin and was followed by [**Last Name (un) **]. He was cleared by PT
for home on [**10-16**]. He was receiving insulin teaching overnight.
The patient's central venous catheter was discontinued and his
scalp staples were removed on [**10-17**]. He was discharged to home
on [**2187-10-17**] with physical therapy home serivces, VNA wound
care for his left arm and insulin/diabetes teaching. The patient
is neurologically intact.
