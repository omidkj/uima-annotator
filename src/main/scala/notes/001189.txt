Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2704**]
Chief Complaint:
shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Atrial flutter ablation & D/C cardioversion ([**2132-5-30**])
Intubation for respiratory distress ([**2132-5-30**])
Left & right heart cardiac catheterization ([**2132-6-2**] & [**2132-6-6**])
Placement of ICD ([**2132-6-4**])


History of Present Illness:
76 y/o man with h/o CAD, s/p MI ([**2107**], [**2131**]), CHF EF 20%, DM, a.
fib/flutter admitted to [**Hospital3 417**] hospital on [**2132-5-21**] for
SOB. Of note, the pt had been admitted to [**Hospital3 417**]
hospital on [**2132-4-26**] with the same complaints.  At that time, he
pt was found to be in respiratory distress and was intubated and
diuresed (and extubated 1 day following intubation).  His
respiratory decompsensation on [**4-26**] was thought to be due CHF
after missing 2 days of lasix.  On [**5-21**], the pt's wife called
911 after the pt became acutely SOB at home.  EMS intubated the
pt en route to [**Hospital3 417**] hospital.  Again, the pt was
diuresed with rapid improvement, leading to extubation within
days.  There was question of PNA, for which he was tx'd with
abx.  Myoview stress testing during the admission was reportedly
negative for ischemia.  Echo on [**5-22**] showed EF = 10%. Pt found
to be in AFR Creatinine w/ Crt peaking at 2 upon admission but
came back to baseline (thought to be ~1.7).  Additionally,
during this admission to [**Hospital3 **], the pt was in afib.  (The pt
does not know when his afib started, and has never undergone
electrocardioversion. He was started on coumadin in early [**Month (only) **].)
 On [**2132-5-29**], the pt was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] to undergo EP
evaluation and possible intervention.
.
Upon review of systems, the pt reported that he can walk the
length of the hallway before getting short of breath. He denies
lightheadedness, orthnopnea, PND, leg edema, or ascites. He had
self-limited palpitations yesterday. No current SOB, and is
comfortable and ambulatory on room air.

TTE [**2132-5-30**]:
1. The left atrium is dilated. No spontaneous echo contrast or
thrombus is  seen in the body of the left atrium/left atrial
appendage or the body of the  right atrium/right atrial
appendage. The left atrial appendage emptying  velocity is
depressed (~0.2m/s). No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or
color Doppler.
2.The left ventricular cavity is dilated. Overall left
ventricular systolic  function is severely depressed 15-20%.
3.There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending thoracic
aorta.
4.The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. No aortic
regurgitation  is seen.
5.The mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. Moderate
(2+) mitral
regurgitation is seen.
6.There is no pericardial effusion.
.
Cardiac Cath [**2132-6-2**]:
COMMENTS:
1. Selective coronary angiography of this left dominant system
revealed
a one vessel coronary disease.  The LMCA was without flow
limiting
stenosis.  The LAD was a large vessel that gave rise to three
diaginal
branches. Proximal LAD had a diffuse 40% stenosis with a
superimposed
90% focal stenosis before a take off of a major diagonal branch
(D3).
The LCx was a dominant vessel with a 30% proximal stenosis and a
30%
stenosis of OM3. The RCA was a small non-dominant vessel with a
mild
diffuse disease throughout.
2. Left ventriculograhy was deferred given renal insufficiency.
3. Resting hemodynamics revealed a moderately high left sided
filling
pressures with a PCWP of 18.  The CI was 2.47.
3. The proximal LAD lesion was predilated with a 2.5 x 15
maverick
balloon and stented with a 3.0 x 28 balloon. The final angiogram
showed
TIMI III flow with no residual stenosis, no dissection, no
embolisation
and no perforation (see PTCA comments)
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. One vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Moderately elevated left sided filling pressures.
3. Successful PTCA/stent of the proximal LAD with excellent
result.


Brief Hospital Course:
I would like to mention at the onset that the patient has
refused further care during this hospitalization and wants to go
home. Fllowing is his brief hospital course:

Upon arrival to [**Hospital1 18**], the pt underwent TEE followed by electric
cardioversion and Aflutter albation.  Post procedure, the pt was
transferred to the floor and was noted to be agitated by wife.
[**Name (NI) **] became hypertensive with SBP in 180s, tachypnic & hypoxemic.
He was intubated, given IV lasix and nitro gtt and transfered to
the CCU.  After receiving lasix, the pt diuresed well and showed
rapid improvement.  No other cause of resp distress was found,
other than acute pulmonary edema.  Thus, he was extubated the
following day.
24hrs s/p extubation the pt became anxious & SOB again,
progressing to respiratory distress.  He was found, as before,
to be in acute pulmonary ede
