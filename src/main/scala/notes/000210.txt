Chief Complaint:
respiratory distress


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
intubated at OSH
radial arterial line placement


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 44y/o gentleman with paranoid schizophrenia, HTN,
and recent treatment for pneumonia last week who was found by
his VNA to be short of breath and is now intubated.  Per EMS
records, VNA found him to be extremely agitated, speaking in
"choppy" sentences.  He reported 30 minutes of sudden shortness
of breath, wheezing, difficulty speaking, and non-productive
cough.  On the scene, initial VS were BP 140/80, HR 120, RR 38,
62%RA - 88% on 6L NC.  He was given nebs with minimal relief and
was brought to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED.
.
In the ED, he was given Levofloxacin and Methylprednisolone.  He
was put on a NRB and continued to be somnolent, lethargic with
bilateral rhonchorous breath sounds.  He was intubated
(mallampati 3), started on Norepinephrine, and was initially
sedated w/ propofol but BP dropped so he switched to Fentanyl
and Versed. Right IJ central line was placed. He was started on
empiric Vancomycin + Levofloxacin.  He was then transferred to
MICU for his respiratory distress.
.
On arrival to the MICU, he was intubated and sedated.  His
Pinspiratory and plateau pressures were elevated, with an
elevated differential.  Nebs, steroids, and diuresis were
initiated.
.

[**2187-1-4**] CXR
Volume overload and cardiomegaly.

[**2187-1-4**] TTE
Suboptimal study. No echocardiographic evidence of intraatrial
or pulmonary-arterial shunting. Normal left ventricular cavity
size and mild symmetric hypertrophy with preservation of global
left ventricular systolic function. Borderline normal right
ventricular systolic function with evidence of pressure/volume
overload consistent with possible primary pulmonary process
(COPD vs pulmonary embolus vs infection). Moderate pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. Very small, circumferential
pericardial effusion without echocardiographic evidence of
tamponade.

[**2187-1-4**] CTA CHEST
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism or acute thoracic aortic
pathology.
2. Bibasilar dense consolidations, concerning for pneumonia,
less likely
atelectasis. Trace bilateral pleural effusions.
3. ETT, right IJ central venous line, feeding tube are all in
optimal
position.
.
CXR [**2187-1-13**]
FINDINGS: The ET tube and NG tube have been removed. The heart
is mildly
enlarged. There is pulmonary vascular redistribution and
probable small left
effusion, but no focal infiltrate. Compared to the prior study,
there has
been some mild improvement in fluid overload.


Brief Hospital Course:
BRIEF HOSPITAL COURSE
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 44y/o morbidly obese gentleman with schizophrenia
who presented to [**Hospital1 18**] intubated/sedated for respiratory failure
from pneumonia
.
ACTIVE ISSUES
.
#. Hypoxemic and hypercarbic respiratory failure: He has a
history of COPD and obstructive sleep apnea and likely has a
component of obesity hypoventilation syndrome. He the developed
a pneumonia. He presented in respiratory failure and was
intubated and admitted to the MICU. He was treated with a course
of vancomycin and zosyn for his pneumonia. He was also diuresed
with lasix gtt and treated with albuterol and ipratropium
nebulizers. He had a prolonged intubation because of his poor
baseline lung function but was successfully extubated. He did
very well post extubation. No new medications were started for
his COPD but this may be considered as an outpatient. He would
also benefit from encouragement of his CPAP use.
.
#. Schizophrenia: Continued on his home antipsychotics.
.
INACTIVE ISSUES
.
#. HTN: Stable. Initially held his lisinopril but this was
restarted on discharge.
