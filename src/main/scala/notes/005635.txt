History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 111034**] is a 68 year-old man with a history of hepatitis
C/ cirrhosis hepatocellular carcinoma s/p cadaveric liver
transplant in [**1-/2118**], also with a history of CAD s/p RCA and LAD
stenting in [**1-/2118**], HTN, GERD, DM type 2, dementia, recently
admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] [**Hospital1 18**] [**Date range (3) 111043**] for fever and hypoxia
felt [**1-31**] RLL pneumonia and treated with Flagyl, Vancomycin and
Levofloxacin empirically, now presenting with recurrent fever,
hypoxia and mental status changes for 1 day.

Per rehab reports, on [**2120-1-10**], patient developed a fever (to
102), hypoxia (91% on 2L) and lethargy ("stopped speaking"). In
the [**Hospital1 **] ED, T 102, HR 112, BP 144/63, R 27, O2 sat 92% 5L. An ABG
initially revealed 7.43/37/76. A CXR revealed persistent
bilateral pleural effusions and RLL atelectasis versus
infiltrate. He was started on vancomycin, ceftazidime and
metronidazole. However, while in the ED, Mr. [**Known lastname 111034**]
developed increasing respiratory distress and was intubated for
increased work of breathing. He was transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**]
[**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for further care.

Past Medical History:
1. Hepatitis C/cirrhosis /HCC, status post cadaveric liver
transplant in [**2118-4-28**]
2. Coronary artery disease, status post RCA and LAD stenting
3. Hypertension
4. Gastroesophageal reflux disease
5. Diabetes mellitus type 2
6. Dementia

Social History:
Ms. [**Name14 (STitle) 111044**] recently moved to a NH ([**2119-1-29**]) secondary
to his progressive dementia. He was born in Sicily. Ex-smoker,
with 10 pack-year smoking history. No h/o IVDU or blood
transfusion prior to [**2104**]. Past history of EtOH consumption. Of
note, received flu shot in 12/[**2118**].


Family History:
Liver disease per OMR notes.

Physical Exam:
Per initial ICU evaluation:
VITALS: T 102, BP 140/80, HR 70s regular, RR 25, Sat 95% on 3L
via NC.
GENERAL: Ill-appearing elderly male, lethargic, not responding
verbally but opens eyes to name and follows commands.
HEENT: PERRL, EOMI, anicteric.
RESP: Bibasilar rales.
CVS: Normal S1, S2. No S3, S4. No murmur or rub.
GI: BS hypoactive. Abdomen soft and non-tender.
EXT: 3+ pitting edema bilaterally to hips.

In ED, patient subsequently developed increased work of
breathing and was intubated, although a repeat blood gas was
essentially unchanged.

EKG on admission: Sinus rhythm, rate 100. Normal tracing.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2119-12-27**], upright T waves in
leads V3-V4.

CXR [**2120-1-10**]:
The heart size and mediastinal contours are unchanged. In
comparison with the previous examination, the lung volumes have
increased. There are stable emphysematous changes bilaterally,
and stable prominence of the interstitial markings and upper
zone pulmonary vascular redistribution. Moderate right pleural
effusion appears slightly increased. No pneumothorax. Persistent
opacity at the right base is suggestive of compressive
atelectasis versus consolidation within the right lower lobe.
The osseous structures appear unremarkable.

IMPRESSION:
Increased right pleural effusion. Persistent bibasilar
atelectasis versus consolidation at the right lower lobe. Stable
pulmonary congestion and emphysematous change.

Relevant data in hospital:

[**2120-1-11**] U/S ABDOMEN: A 4-quadrant son[**Name (NI) 493**] examination of
the abdomen was performed to evaluate for ascites. No ascites
was demonstrated. No attempted paracentesis or marking of spot
was made.

[**2120-1-11**] CXR An endotracheal tube terminates at the thoracic
inlet. An NG tube curls within the stomach with its distal tip
at the fundus. The heart is not enlarged. There is mild
pulmonary edema. Bilateral effusions are present along with
atelectasis at both lung bases that appear unchanged when
compared to the prior examination. No osseous abnormalities are
seen. No pneumothorax is identified.

[**2120-1-17**] CXR: AP single view obtained with the patient in
semierect position, is analyzed in direct comparison with a
previous chest examination dated [**2120-1-11**]. The patient is now
extubated. An NG tube remains and reaches below the diaphragm,
apparently curled up in the stomach.

There is no evidence of pneumothorax. Both lungs are well
expanded. The bases are somewhat diffusely obscured, more marked
on the right than on the left. A right diaphragmatic contour is
obliterated and a density along the lateral wall is suggestive
of pleural effusion layering mostly posteriorly. There is no
conclusive evidence for any parenchymal infiltrate. In answer to
specific question of free abdominal air, there is no conclusive
evidence of such finding, but this cannot be completely
eliminated as the patient is in semierect position only.

Brief Hospital Course:
68 year-old man with a history of hepatitis
C/cirrhosis/hepatocellular carcinoma s/p cadaveric liver
transplant in [**1-/2118**], also with a h/o CAD s/p RCA and LAD
stenting, dementia and recent admission for pneumonia, now
presenting with a 1-day history of fever, hypoxia and mental
status changes. His hospital course will be reviewed by
problems.

1) Fever: A CXR on admission was suspicious for a RLL infiltrate
(atelectasis versus pneumonia), and Mr. [**Known lastname 111034**] was initially
started on broad spectrum antibiotics with Vancomycin, Flagyl
and Ceftazidime pending culture data. His urine eventually grew
Klebsiella, and sputum cultures revealed GNR. In light of these
results, Vancomycin was D/C'd on [**2120-1-11**], and Cipro was added
for double gram negative coverage pending final organism
identification and sensitivites. Sensitivities revealed
Klebsiella resistant to Cephalosporins, and sensitive to
Imipenem. Hence, Ceftazidime and Flagyl were D/C'd on [**2120-1-12**],
and Imipenem was started. The sputum culture eventually grew
Klebsiella with the same sensitivities as in the urine, and
Cipro was D/C'd on [**2120-1-15**]. The patient defervesced on the
above antibiotherapy, and plan is to complete a 14-day course of
Imipenem monotherapy (last doses on [**2120-1-25**]). While in
hospital, he developed diarrhea, negative for C.difficile. Also
of note, Mr. [**Known lastname 111034**] has sacral and heel pressure ulcers,
which will need to be followed up. The patient was seen by the
wound care nurse while in hospital.

2) Respiratory failure: His initial respiratory failure was felt
most likely secondary to pneumonia +/- chemical pneumonitis in
the setting of a depressed mental status. As noted above, Mr.
[**Name13 (STitle) 111045**] was intubated shortly after admission, and transferred
to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for further care. He was quickly extubated on
[**2120-1-11**] at night, and remained stable from a respiratory
standpoint following extubation. He was transferred back to the
floor on [**2120-1-12**] on supplemental oxygen 4L via NC. A CXR on
[**2120-1-11**] was consistent with m
