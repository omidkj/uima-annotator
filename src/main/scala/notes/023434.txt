Chief Complaint:
Hyperglycemic, hyperosmolar state.

Cardiac catheterization.


History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 22204**] is a 65 yo female with h/o TypeI DM w/ insulin pump,
who brought herself to the ED for elevated blood glucose.
Yesterday evening she noted that her blood sugars were > 600.
She c/o general malaise, but otherwise has no specific
complaints. She states that she changed her pump yesterday
morning and had the feeling that it was not inserted correctly.
She attempted to change it again last night when she noted  her
BS were high.  She thought it was working and went to bed.  She
woke up this morning feeling generally lousy and nauseated.  She
denies CP, SOB, abd pain, fevers, chills, vomiting, increased
urinary frequency and dysuria.  She reports not thinking clearly
at the time.  She did not think she needed to give herself a SC
injection of insulin. Patient has not been hospitalized with DKA
frequently - last admission may have been at diagnosis at aged
18.  She believes her last HbA1c was around 8.
.
In the ED, VS were T 97.2, BP 105/48, HR 90, O2 sat 99% on RA.
CXR and UA were negative.  She was placed on an insulin drip
given IV Fluids and tranfered to the ICU.

Cardiac Cath [**2175-8-7**]:
COMMENTS:
1. Coronary angiography of this right dominant system revealed
two vessel coronary artery disease with diffuse atherosclerosis
with a patent prior RCA stent. The LMCA was a short vessel with
almost dual ostia. The LAD was heavily calcified proximally and
had a proximal 40-50% stenosis and diffuse plaquing to 50% in
the mid-distal vessel. The LCx had heavy calcification. There
was mild diffuse plaquing throughout to 30-40% with tortouous
terminal branches of a single major OM. The RCA had diffuse
plaquing throughout with mild in-stent restenosis of the
mid-distal RCA [**Doctor First Name 10788**] stent with a 35% distal edge restnosis. The
distal RCA was tortuous. The origin of the R PDA (<2 mm diameter
by QCA) had a 70% stenosis. There were multiple RPLs.
2. Resting hemodynamics revealed severe systemic systolic
arterial hypertension (SBP 189 mm Hg) and moderately elevated LV
filling pressure(LVEDP 19 mm Hg).
3. Left ventriculography was not performed.
.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Two vessel coronary artery disease with diffuse
atherosclerosis.
2. Patent prior mid-RCA [**Doctor First Name 10788**] bare metal stent.
3. Severe systemic systolic arterial hypertension.
4. Moderate LV diastolic heart failure.
.
.
ECHO [**2175-8-7**]:
The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. Left
ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global
systolic function are normal (LVEF >65%) The estimated cardiac
index is normal(>=2.5L/min/m2). Right ventricular chamber size
and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no
aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve appears structurally
normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is no mitral
valve prolapse. There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2174-6-10**],
biventricular systolic function remains preserved. Borderline
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension is now identified.


Brief Hospital Course:
65 yo Female with Type I DM who presented with hyperglycemic
hyperosmolar state after her insulin pump malfunctioned. There
did not appear to be an infectious cause that precipitated this.
.
# CAD: The patient had known CAD, with known PCI in [**2166**] to RCA.
Since then no cardiac cath. Stress (P MIBI) in [**6-7**] and Echo in
[**6-7**] were normal (with the exception of focal calcifications of
the aortic arch). The patient has been chest pain free and on
this admission but was found to have EKG changes in V5/V6 TWI /
ST depressions and mildly elevated troponins. Given the
patient's high risk (known CAD, multiple risk factors, age, +
enzymes, EKG changes) and TIMI score of 5, it was felt she would
benefit from early angiography for NSTEMI. She was started on
aspirin 325 daily and heparin IV. Given the high risk and STE in
aVR leading to ? LM disease, plavix was held in case CABG would
be needed. Her lopressor was increased to 25mg po bid. Her lipid
panel came back normal. She received a cardiac catheterization
on [**2175-8-7**] which did show diffuse disease (see report) but
nothing that was deemed intervenable. Her post-precedure course
was unremarkable. Given her MS and difficulty ambulating (she
currently uses a wheelchair), she requested transfer to rehab
and was evaulated by PT/OT. She was discharged on [**2175-8-9**].
.
#hyperglycemia: She has had DM typeI from age 18. The gap was
closed, and the cause was felt to be due to a malfunctioning
insulin pump. [**Last Name (un) **] was consulted and the patient was advised
to restart her pump after the catheterization procedure. Until
that time, she was covered with sliding scale insulin. Her pump
was restarted on [**2175-8-8**] and [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) **], her sensitivity for
correction was switched from 1:45 to 1:30. She w
