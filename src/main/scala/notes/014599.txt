Brief Hospital Course:
Dr. [**Known lastname 66363**] is a 71 yo male with h/o HTN & HLD who presented
with chest pain found to have NSTEMI.
.
# NSTEMI: Patient with chest pain intially on exertion and
intermittently at rest  with elevated troponins and T wave
changes in V3-V5, III, aVF. Patient received cardiac cath with
balloon angioplasty to the OM. Cath showed thrombotic occlusion
of OM, received POBA only, due to GIB. Pt tolerated procedure
well. He will go home on ASA 81mg daily, lipitor 80mg daily,
metoprolol succinate 25mg daily.
.
# Anemia: Hct noted to be 43 at OSH, and trended down to 36 at
this hospital. Anemia likely combination of hemodilutional as
well as GI loss. Stool noted to be guaiac postive and pt with
hematemesis episode. Pt will follow up with GI outpatient for
upper endoscopy.
.
# Hemetemesis: Pt had episodes of vomiting followed by vomiting
of blood. GI was consulted and attributed his hematemesis to
likely [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 329**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] tear from his vomiting. Pt encouraged to
follow this up outpatient for upper endoscopy. He was started on

Discharge Instructions:
It was a pleasure caring for you, Dr. [**Known lastname 66363**]. You were admitted
for chest pain and were found to have a heart attack.  You went
for catheterization and a balloon was used to open one of the
arteries perfusing your heart. You have done well since then and
are ready to go home. It is important to follow up with the
[**Hospital3 **] cardiologist within the next 1 week.
.
Before your catheterization, you vomited blood. We believe that
this was due to a small tear in your esophagus caused by
retching, which should heal on its own. However, you could have
more serious problems in your stomach and should have an
endoscopy done as an outpatient. You can help arrange this with
your primary care doctor. Please make sure to see your
cardiologist this coming week.
You vomited blood during this admission. It is very important to
follow this up with your PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) 357**] make sure to schedule an
outpatient upper endoscopy.
.
You were started on several medication
