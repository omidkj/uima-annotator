Cardiac catheterization: Selective coronary angiography of this
right dominant system demonstrated a known three vessel coronary
disease.  The LMCA had a 90% in-stent restenosis of the left
main-ramus bifrucation.  The LAD had a known proximal occlusion.
 Distal LAD filled via LIMA graft.  The LCx had a known total
occlusion.  The RCA had a known occlusion and was not injected
(distal RCA filled via SVG). Arterial conduit angiography
revealed that the LIMA to LAD had a less
than 50% instent restenosis that was not flow limiting.  The SVG
to
distal RCA was widely patent. Resting hemodynamics revealed
elevated right and left sided filling pressured with RVEDP of 19
mmHg and a PCWP of 25 mm Hg.  There was a moderate pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension with a PASP of 51 mm Hg. The
cardiac index was preserved at 2.5 l/min/m2.  There was a
significant arterial hypotension with a central aortic pressure
of 74/41 mm Hg necessitating initiation of dopamine infusion.
Left ventriculography was deferred give patients declining renal
function. Of note, arterial and venous access was obtained via
left groin given dimished right femoral pulse and a history of
right iliac stent placement. Successful PTCA and stenting of the
Ramus Intermedius and Left Main bifurcation with a 3.5x8 mm
Taxus stent.  Final angiography revealed minimal residual
stenosis, no angiographically apparent dissection, and TIMI 3
flow in the vessel.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 72M h/o CAD s/p CABG ([**2109**]/redo [**2120**]), CHF (EF<20) s/p
BiV/ICD [**5-30**], AF, DM2 s/p stent [**4-30**] to RAMUS & LIMA anastomosis
now presents with hypotension/NSTEMI. Had in-stent restenosis of
RAMUS, which was re-stented with DES.
.
## Cardiac:
- Ischemia: pt had NSTEMI, underwent cardiac cath which revealed
LMCA with a 90%
in-stent restenosis of the left main-ramus bifrucation.  This
area was stented.    There were other stenotic areas (see
report) that were not stented as they were not felt to be
culprit lesions. The pt was treated with ASA 325, clopidogrel
75, atorvastatin 20 PO qd.  His carvedilol was resumed after his
BP improved.  Post-procedure the pt was hypotensive and required
pressors; however, he was weaned off of these & was eventually
re-started on 3.125 of carvedilol.
- Pump/hypotension: Pt has history of severe cardiomyopathy/CHF
with an EF <20%.  Right heart cath revealed elevated right and
left sided filling
pressured with RVEDP of 19 mmHg and a PCWP of 25 mm Hg.  There
was a
moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension with a PASP of
51 mm Hg.
The cardiac index was preserved at 2.5 l/min/m2.  There was a
significant arterial hypotension with a central aortic pressure
of 74/41
mm Hg necessitating initiation of dopamine infusion.  The pt
required dopamine off and on during his stay; however, with
aggressive diuresis he was able to be weaned off it completely.
The pt was significantly volume overloaded upon arrival and
post-cath.  Though he tolerated resumption of carvedilol, his
ACE inhibitor was held during the hospitalization.  His SBPs
ranged from 90's-100's near time of discharge.
- Rhythm: the pt was in BiVentricular paced rhythm.  His
coumadin was initially held because he was anemic & had dark,
guiac (+) stools.  After stabilization of his Hct, coumadin was
restarted at 2.5 qod and 5mg qod.
.
## Anemia/bleed: pt has h/o GI bleeding & was found to guaiac
positive stool during admission.  GI was consulted & deferred
endoscopy until the pt was stabilized and an outpt.  Pt also had
multiple nosebleeds during hospitalization.  ENT was consulted:
they felt that there was no serious underlying pathology.  They
recommend affrin.  These eventually resolved.
Upon work-up of his anemia, pt was found to be iron deficient.
He was started on PO iron.  He was also continued on his outpt
EPO dosing (for CRI).  During hospitalization, he required
multiple transfusions, the last of which was given the day prior
to discharge.  The pt's hct responded appropriately to the
transfusion & he was asymptomatic.
.
## Renal: ARF on CRF. Pt's baseline thought to be approximately
Cr 1.9.  However, his PCP reported that just prior to admission
he had a Crt of 3.  Upon admission, his crt was 3.5.  It peaked
at 3.9.  He had low urine output & FeNA < 1%.  Renal was
consulted and they felt that the ARF was primarily due to
CHF--poor forward flow.  HD was deferred and the pt was
aggressively diuresed.  With diuresis, his SBP improved (as did
his UOP), and the crt trended down to 2.3 on day of discharge.
The pt did have hematuria after Foley removal, which was thought
to be secondary to trauma.  This resolved over a few days.
Will follow closely for anuria given risk of clot. S-PEP & U-PEP
were checked (upon renal's rec's) & were negative.
.
## Hyponatremia: Likely [**2-26**] cardiomyopathy and ARF.  The pt was
free water restricted.
## Thrombocytopenia: ? HIT vs. liver dz. LFTs norma
