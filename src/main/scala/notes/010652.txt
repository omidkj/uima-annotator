History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 101110**] is a 77M with a history of known proximal
descending aortic arch penetrating ulcer (found in [**2189**]
medically treated) also with history of CAD s/p CABG, who
intially presented to [**Hospital 4199**] hospital on [**2194-11-8**] with 9/10
chest pain radiating to the back x 1 day. CTA at this time
showed worsening ulcer and he was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for
surgical intervention. On arrival to ED, EKG showed new LBBB and
Cardiology thought this was [**2-27**] chronic ischemic cardiac
disease. While on vascular surgical service hypertension was
attempted to be controlled with labetolol drip and IV Labetalol
pushes with goal BP<120. He was then found to have acute renal
failure which was thought most likely secondary to contrast
infuced nephropathy from CTA. Aggressive IVFs for treatment of
CIN caused respiratory distress and pulmonary edema. TTE showed
LVEF40% stable, moderate MR, moderate to severe TR. Patient was
transferred to the unit where he was intubated for a short term
and started on a Lasix drip.

While in the MICU, patient was agressively diuresed with lasix
drip while understanding kidneys needed protection. Hypertension
was difficult to control requiring Nicardipine drip to maintain
SBPs <120. Nicardipine has since been discontinued on Tuesday
(day before transfer) and oral regimen of Amlodipine 10mg, Imdur
90mg daily, Carvedilol 25 [**Hospital1 **] and Hydralazine 50mg PO TID have
been able to maintain BP at goal. Renal function improved
slightly to 2.4 (baseline of 1) and Lasix drip discontinued >24
hours ago. Patient has now been autodiuresing -500 today without
medical diuresis. Of note, also patient received 4 transfusions
during admission [**2194-11-9**] x2, [**2194-11-12**] and 10/18/12m. No clear
source of bleeding and patient was guiac negative.

On arrival to the floor, patient overall appears well though
with pain in his legs which is a chronic issue. He is upset that
pain is not being adequately treated and he is only receiving
half his normal home dose. He is breathing comfortably on 4L NC.
