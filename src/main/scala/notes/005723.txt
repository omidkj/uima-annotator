MICROBIOLOGY:
[**2141-6-22**] Urine Cx - Proteus
[**2141-6-27**] Urine Cx - negative
[**2141-6-27**] Blood Cx - preliminary - NGTD

STUDIES:
ECHO [**2141-6-27**]: Dilated LA and RA. LV wall thickness and motion
normal. LVEF 50%. RV size and motion normal. No AS, AR, MVR.
Moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.

CXR [**2141-6-27**] interval improvement of the upper lungs with
simultaneous deterioration of the right lung base in the
infrahilar area.
Those findings might represent fluctuating pulmonary edema or
position
dependent pulmonary edema. No appreciable pleural effusion is
demonstrated. The infrahilar opacity on the other hand might
represent a worsening infectious process and close attention to
this area on the subsequent studies to exclude the possibility
of worsening infection is recommended. Cardiomegaly is
unchanged.


Brief Hospital Course:
87yo female with a history of rectal cancer, atrial
fibrillation, and type 2 Diabetes mellitus was admitted for
treatment of rectal cancer with post-operative course
complicated by atrial fibrillation with RVR, shortness of
breath, and acute on chronic renal failure.

1. Rectal Cancer
Patient underwent endoscopic resection of rectal mass without
immediate complication. She was recommended to call Dr.[**Name (NI) 3377**]
office for follow-up at her earliest convenience.

2. Atrial Fibrillation
Her post-operative course was complicated by atrial fibrillation
with RVR, this was thought likely related to fluid overload. She
was diuresed and her nodal agents were further titrated for
improved control of her heart rate. She is not on
anticoagulation as an outpatient, and she was started on a full
dose aspirin for anticoagulation. Echocardiogram during this
admission demonstrated likely systolic heart failure.

3. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure
Patient's creatinine increased from 1.5 to 2.2 with aggressive
diuresis in the intensive care unit. Upon discharge to the
floor, her creatinine improved from 2.2 on [**2141-6-28**] to 1.7 on
[**2141-6-30**].

4. Anemia
Her hematocrit was 28.1 on admission and declined to between
24-26 upon discharge.

5. Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus
Patient was continued on insulin sliding scale.

6. Glaucoma
Patient was continued on her home regimen of eye drops.
