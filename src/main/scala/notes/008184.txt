Pertinent Results:
[**2161-10-13**] Cardiac Cath
1.  Coronary angiography in this right-dominant system revealed:

--the LMCA had no angiographically apparent disease.
--the LAD had no angiographically apparent disease.
--the LCX had no angiographically apparent disease.
--the RCA had no angiographically apparent disease.
2.  Resting hemodynamics revealed high-normal right-sided
filling
pressures with RVEDP 6 mmHg.  The PCWP was elevated at 15 mmHg;
the
LVEDP was 9 mmHg.  There was mild pulmonary arterial systolic
hypertension with PASP 31 mmHg.  The cardiac output was normal
with CI
2.9 L/min/m2.  There was normal systemic arterial systolic
pressure,
with SBP 115 mmHg.  There was no gradient across the aortic
valve upon
pullback of the angled pigtail catheter from LV to ascending
aorta.
3.  Hemodynamic evaluation of the mitral valve revealed the
mitral valve
gradient to be approximately 5 mmHg with a calculated mitral
valve area
of 1.9 cm2.
4.  Left ventriculography revealed normal wall motion, LVEF 61%,
and
[**2-24**]+ mitral regurgitation into a dilated left atrium.
5.  Supravalvular aortography revealed 2+ aortic regurgitation.

[**2161-10-14**] ECHO
PRE-BYPASS:
1. The left atrium is markedly dilated. A left-to-right shunt
across the interatrial septum is seen at rest. A small secundum
atrial septal defect is present.
2. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
3. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal.
4. There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
5. There are three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is mild aortic valve
stenosis (area 1.2-1.9cm2). Moderate (2+) aortic regurgitation
is seen.
6. The mitral valve leaflets are severely thickened/deformed.
There is moderate valvular mitral stenosis (area 1.0-1.5cm2).
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
7. There is no pericardial effusion.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in person of the results.

POST-BYPASS: For the post-bypass study, the patient was
receiving vasoactive infusions including epinephrine &
phenylephrine and is AV paced.
1. A well-seated bileaflet valve is seen in the mitral position
with normal leaflet motion and gradients (mean gradient = 3
mmHg). Trivial (normal for prosthesis) mitral regurgitation is
seen. Washing jets are seen.
2. A wellseated bileaflet valve is seen in the Aortic position.
Valve is not well seen due to shadowing, leaflets appear to move
well. Mean Gradient is 3 mm of Hg. No significant valvular or
paravalvular jets seen (however cannot exclude smaller jets)
3. Biventricular functions appears unchanged.
4. Aorta is intact post decannulation.
5. Other findings are unchanged.

[**2161-10-17**] CT Scan
1. Mild-to-moderate free intraperitoneal air collecting
underneath the
diaphragm. No definite source is identified, but likely relates
to recent
surgery. Bowel is normal in appearance. There is no
extravasation of oral
contrast material or intra- abdominal or intrapelvic fluid
collection.
2. Large left and small right pleural effusions.
3. Small amount of gas, fluid, and intermediate density material
in the
inferior-most portion of the imaged mediastinum, presumably
related to recent surgery.
4. Bilateral hydroureteronephrosis, right worse than left. No
stones or other filling defect is identified.

[**2161-10-20**] ECHO
Pre evacaution: The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular
cavity is unusually small. There is mild regional left
ventricular systolic dysfunction with anterior hypokinesis.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed
(LVEF= 40 %). The right ventricular cavity is unusually small.
with moderate global free wall hypokinesis. There is severe
compression of the right atrium and ventricle by a large
retorcardiac mass which is consistent with organizing thrombus.
The right atrium is slit like and severely compressed. There is
a large left pleural effusion. There are simple atheroma in the
ascending aorta. There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the aortic
arch. There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending
thoracic aorta. A bileaflet aortic valve prosthesis is present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen. Aortic valve gradeints are
normal for prosthesis. A mechanical mitral valve prosthesis is
present. Gradients are normal for prosthesis. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid
regurgitation is seen.

Post evacuation. The right atrium is now mildly dilated. RV free
wall hypokiensis is mild to moderate. LVEF 40%. Remaining exam
is unchanged. All findings disucssed with surgeons at the time
of the exam


Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 66252**] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2161-10-13**] for a cardiac
catheterization in preparation for her redo valve surgery. Her
cardiac catheterization showed normal coronary arteries, severe
mitral rtegurgitation and moderate aortic regurgitation. On
[**2161-10-14**], Ms. [**Known lastname 66252**] was taken to the operating room where she
underwent [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 66253**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] aortic and mitral valve
replacement with St. [**Male First Name (un) 923**] mechanical valves and closure of an
atrial septal defect. Please see operative note for details.
Postoperatively she was taken to the intensive care unit for
monitoring. On postoperative day one, she awoke neurologically
intact and was extubated. Heparin was tarted for anticoagulation
and coumadin was resumed. On postoperative day two, she was
transferred to the step down unit for further recovery. She was
transfused with red blood cells for postoperative anemia. Gentle
diuresis was initiated. Free air was noted in her belly on x-ray
and a CT scan was obtained. No significant abnormalities were
seen. On [**2161-10-18**], Ms. [**Known lastname 66252**] developed hypotension and and echo
was su
