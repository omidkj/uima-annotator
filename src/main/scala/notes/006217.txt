Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1253**]
Chief Complaint:
Right Subdural Hematoma

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**3-16**]: Right craniotomy for Subdural hematoma
[**3-23**]: PICC placement


History of Present Illness:
79 yo male w/ PMHx [**Month/Year (2) 65**] for HTN, hypercholesterolemia, and CABG
x4 10 years ago who present after outpt CT showed R SDH.  The
patient fell off a bike on [**11-4**] and struck the side of his
head.  He states that he was seen at an OSH at the time and had
imaging, the results are unclear.  [**Name2 (NI) **] has not noticed and
residual problems since that time.  Two days ago, he was walking
across the street and could not stop himself so he had to make
himself fall onto some grass.  He landed on his R shoulder.  He
was seen at an outside hospital and sent home.  He
then saw his PCP who ordered [**Name Initial (PRE) **] CT head for [**3-15**] that showed
subacute on chronic R SDH with partial effacement of R lateral
ventricle and moderate midline shift.  He was then transferred
to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.

Imaging:
Head CT [**3-16**]:
NON-CONTRAST HEAD CT: There is a right frontoparietal subdural
collection,
measuring approximately 22 mm from the inner table. This has
heterogeneous
attenuation suggesting acute-on-chronic hemorrhage. The
hyperattenuating
regions have a linear, septated appearance. There is associated
mass effect, with effacement of the adjacent right cerebral
sulci, as well as approximately 8-9 mm shift leftward of
normally midline structures. However, there is no dilatation of
the contralateral lateral ventricle. There is no evidence for
transtentorial herniation. There is no evidence for
intraparenchymal, or intraventricular blood. The [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white
differentiation appears preserved, with no significant edema and
no evidence for acute large vascular territorial infarction.
Osseous structures are unremarkable with no suspicious lytic or
sclerotic lesions. The visualized paranasal sinuses are normally
pneumatized and likely clear, although motion artifact limits
evaluation of the ethmoid
air cells.
IMPRESSION: Moderate heterogeneous right subdural collection,
suggesting
acute-on-chronic hemorrhage with associated effacement of the
adjacent sulci and approximately 8-9 mm leftward shift of
normally midline structures.

Head CT [**3-17**](post-op):
NONCONTRAST HEAD CT: A right frontal craniotomy is again seen.
Compared to
one day prior, there has been decrease in the amount of
pneumocephalus
bilaterally. The right frontal/parietal/temporal subdural
collection has
decreased in size. There are hyperdense blood products in the
dependent
portion of the collection. Since the collection has changed in
size and
configuration, it is not clear whether any new hyperdense blood
products are present. There is persistent leftward shift of
midline structures by
approximately 5 mm, unchanged. There is persistent partial
effacement of the right lateral ventricle. There remains fluid
and mucosal thickening in the frontal, ethmoid and sphenoid
sinuses, which may be related to the nasogastric tube.
IMPRESSION: The right subdural collection has decreased in size,
but
associated leftward shift of midline structures is not
significantly changed.

Cardiac Echo [**3-16**]:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thickness,
cavity size and regional/global systolic function are normal
(LVEF >55%). There is no ventricular septal defect. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial mitral
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.

CXR [**3-17**]:
FINDINGS: The Dobbhoff tube has been repositioned, and the tip
now resides
within the stomach. There is again mild fluid overload versus
edema. There
is mild atelectasis at the left lung base. The appearance of the
chest is not significantly changed since prior study. Bilateral
healed rib fractures again noted.


Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 79 yo M with CAD s/p CABG in [**2114**], HTN, hyperlipidemia,
admitted after fall with acute on chronic right subdural
hematoma, s/p craniotomy with dysphagia, confusion and new onset
atrial flutter.
.
Fall s/p SDH: Patient was found to have subacute on chronic
subdural hematoma with midline shift on admission s/p fall in
[**Month (only) **] and repeat fall 2 days prior to admission; etiology of
falls is unclear. Craniotomy with evacuation of clot was
performed on [**3-16**] by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]. Patient's postoperative course
was significant for delirium/confusion and dysphagia which
required a post-pyloric Dobhoff to be placed. His neurological
status remained stable after surgery with resolution of his
left-sided hemiparesis upon evaluation when transferred to the
medicine service. He was placed on dilantin for anti-seizure
prophlyaxis at 100mg PO TID.  His goal levels are [**10-16**].  On
discharge his level was 6.5 but after correction for
hypoalbuminemia it was 9. Tomorrow he should be at a steady
state and he should have his levels checked on [**2125-3-28**] and his
phenytoin adjusted appropriately for goal levels between [**10-16**].

We restrated ASA 81mg daily.  He will need neurosurgery follow
up around [**2125-4-16**] with head CT prior. This appointment needs to
be scheduled after discharge; the nurse practioner for Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] has his information and said she will contact the
rehabilitation center.
.
Delirium/Confusion: Patient was significantly confused/delirious
after surgery; this was likely multifactorial including surgical
insult, LLL pneumonia, hypernatremia. As he was treated for his
LLL pneumonia and his electrolytes corrected, he gradually
improved back to baseline. He received haldol for agitation, but
had not used any for many days prior to discharge.
.
Atrial flutter: Patient developed Aflutter with RVR on [**2125-3-20**]
with HR into 150s. He was transferred to the medical service for
management and was rate controlled on metoprolol with good
