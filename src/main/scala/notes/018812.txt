Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5547**]
Chief Complaint:

History of Present Illness:
This is a 66 year old male, transferred from [**Hospital3 7569**]
with pancreatitis, respiratory failure, ?pna, and NSVT. Pt
initially presented to [**Hospital3 7569**] on [**4-7**]; by report, he
had sudden onset of bdominal/epigastric pain with associated
nausea (no vomiting). He was initially afebrile, hypertensive,
tachycardic; amylase was 1851, lipase was >6000.

Past Medical History:
PNA, Schizophrenia, Syncope

LIVER OR GALLBLADDER US (SINGL

Reason: evaluate gallbladder, duct; please measure CBD

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
66 year old man with gallstone pancreatitis, fevers, ?dilation
of CBD
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
evaluate gallbladder, duct; please measure CBD
INDICATION: 66-year-old male with gallstone pancreatitis and
concern for common bile duct dilatation.

RIGHT UPPER QUADRANT ULTRASOUND: The liver demonstrates a 1.8 x
1.6 x 1.5 cm well circumscribed echogenic focus of the posterior
right hepatic lobe compatible with a hemangioma. The gallbladder
is contracted and contains sludge and a few small stones. There
is no pericholecystic fluid. The contracted state of the
gallbladder causes apparent wall thickening. There is no intra-
or extrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation. The common bile duct
measures 3-4 mm. There is no ascites. Incompletely visualized is
a right pleural effusion. The pancreas is not well seen due to
overlying bowel gas. There is appropriate hepatopetal portal
venous flow. The right kidney is unremarkable.

IMPRESSION:
1. Contracted gallbladder with small stones and sludge.
2. No intra- or extrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation, with the
common duct measuring 3-4 mm.
3. 1.8 cm well circumscribed echogenic focus of the posterior
right hepatic lobe is consistent with an hemangioma.
4. Limited evaluation of the pancreas due to overlying bowel
gas.

INTERPRETATION:

Findings:

LEFT ATRIUM: Normal LA size.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Normal RA size. Lipomatous
hypertrophy of the
interatrial septum.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thickness, cavity size, and
systolic function
(LVEF>55%). Suboptimal technical quality, a focal LV wall motion
abnormality
cannot be fully excluded.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTA: Mildly dilated aortic root.

AORTIC VALVE: Normal aortic valve leaflets. No AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Normal mitral valve leaflets with trivial MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets with trivial
TR. Mild PA
systolic hypertension.

PERICARDIUM: There is an anterior space which most likely
represents a fat
pad, though a loculated anterior pericardial effusion cannot be
excluded.

GENERAL COMMENTS: Suboptimal image quality - poor echo windows.
Suboptimal
image quality - ventilator. Based on [**2133**] AHA endocarditis
prophylaxis
recommendations, the echo findings indicate a low risk
(prophylaxis not
recommended). Clinical decisions regarding the need for
prophylaxis should be
based on clinical and echocardiographic data.

Conclusions:
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity
size, and systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%). Due to
suboptimal technical
quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully
excluded. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic root is
mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets appear structurally
normal with good
leaflet excursion. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve appears
structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is
mild pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is an anterior space which
most likely
represents a fat pad.

IMPRESSION: Preserved global biventricular systolic function.
Mild pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension.

Based on [**2133**] AHA endocarditis prophylaxis recommendations, the
echo findings
indicate a low risk (prophylaxis not recommended). Clinical
decisions
regarding the need for prophylaxis should be based on clinical
and
echocardiographic data.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)

Reason: interval changes in lung volumes, infiltrate

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:

Elevated Peak Pressures, abd distention
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
interval changes in lung volumes, infiltrate
AP CHEST, 6:07 A.M., [**2143-4-19**].

HISTORY: Pancreatitis.

IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**4-14**] and 24.

Left lower lobe collapse has not improved. Lung volumes are low
normal. Small bilateral pleural effusions unchanged. No
pneumothorax. Heart size normal and mediastinum midline. ET tube

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST

Reason: Intracranial process causing sedation and coma

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
66 year old man with pancreatitis, Off all sedation but not
responding neurologically
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
Intracranial process causing sedation and coma
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.

INDICATION: 66-year-old male with history of pancreatitis. The
patient is now off all sedation but not responding.

COMPARISONS: No comparisons are available.

TECHNIQUE: CT of the head without IV contrast.

FINDINGS: There are very severe periventricular hypodensities.
These are more severe in the bilateral frontal lobes where there
is loss of the [**Doctor Last Name 352**]- white matter differentiation at some point.
There is also encephalomalacia and atrophy involving
predominantly the right temporal lobe. There is a lacunar
infarct within the left thalamus. The ventricles are prominent.
The above findings are most likely secondary to chronic ischemic
changes and chronic infarcts. There are calcifications in the
falx. There is no evidence of herniation. There is no evidence
of hemorrhage, shift of normally midline structures. No evidence
of mass effect. There is mild opacification of the bilateral
maxillary sinus, ethmoid sinuses, and sphenoid sinuses. There is
severe septal deviation to the right side. The NG tube is coiled
in the nasopharynx. There is mild opacification of the external
auditory canal bilaterally (left greater than right), correlate
with physical examination. There is mild opacification of the
bilateral mastoid air cells.

IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of hem
