Brief Hospital Course:
ASSESS: 77 yo man with Parkinsons disease, dementia and CAD,
presents with acute respiratory distress, due to sepsis/CHF.
Patient was initially intubated for respiratory failure and
concern for GIB. Subsequently developed hypotension with
sedation, with persistent tachycardia, elevated lactate, stable
hct.

1. Sepsis/Hypotension: Cause strongly suspected to be urosepsis,
outside urine culture from [**Hospital1 18**] [**Location (un) 620**] grew E. Coli sensitive
to Ceftriaxone. The patient initially received Ceftriaxone at
[**Location (un) 620**] and a dose of Vanc, Levo, and Flagyl here. After HD #1
only Vanc and Ceftriaxone were continued. The patient was
agressively fluid recussitated, initially requiring Levophed for
BP support. By AM of HD#1, this was able to be d/c. BP was
further supported with fluid boluses titrated to keep UOP
>30CC/hr. Steroid therapy was started empirically for suspected
sepsis. This was continued only transiently. Initially Hct fell
to <25, the patient had presented to [**Location (un) 620**] with hx of BRBPR.
His HCT appropriately responded to transfusion. He was intubated
initially for support and was successfully extubated on [**1-8**].
He was given a 5-day course of vancomycin (for gpc in sputum)
and 14-day course of ceftriaxone (for E. coli in urine).  His
WBC continued to trend down, he remained afebrile, and was
clinically improved at time of discharge.  All cultures remained
negative (only positive culture was from [**Hospital1 18**] [**Location (un) 620**]; E. coli
[**Last Name (un) 36**] to ceftriaxone, resistant to quinolones).  He received a
PICC prior to discharge for completion of his IV antibiotic
course.  He remained hemodynamically stable, and his BP meds
were restarted. He was additionally diuresed with lasix (for CHF
and s/p fluids given in unit for sepsis). He was stable at time
of discharge).


2.  Demand Ischemia: MB flat, Trop +, likely demand. He was
managed medically on ASA, metoprolol (which was titrated up with
good success), Plavix, Zocor, and lisinopril.  He was discharged
on this medical regimen. He had no events on tele while
in-house, and his EKG remained stable.

3.  CHF: Pt with an EF=40%.  He was given large volume fluid
resuscitation on presentation for sepsis and became quite volume
overloaded.  When he was stable hemodynamically, he was diuresed
with lasix with good success.  He was discharged on a standing
dose of lasix (40 mg PO) to maintain clinical euvolemia by
ins/outs.

4.  GIB: HCT decrease to 28. Baseline: 32-34.  He was initially
transfused and had a stable hct since that time.  As per GI, he
will have outpatient GI follow up and will likely need an
outpatient colonoscopy. After the initial episode of BRBPR, he
was guaiac negative subsequently.

5.  AMS: Likely sedation for intubation, lingering effect given
poor baseline with dementia and Parkinson's.  Head CT was
without any acute event/mass.  HE was at his baseline (according
to family) at time of discharge).  His donepezil and Sinemet
were continued throughout hospitalization.

6.  ACCESS: R femerol groin line, R Subclavian sepsis line
placed.  These were d/ced and he had a right PICC placed on
discharge for completion of his antibiotic course.

7.  CODE: Full per OSH ED attg's discussion with family.

8.  PROPH: SQ heparin, IV PPI were continued in-house

9.  Dispo: pt to return to [**Hospital **] nursing home, to complete
14-day course of antibiotics (ceftriaxone).  He was stable at
time of discharge.  He was cleared by speech and swallow for
PO's (thin liquids/ground solids). He will need assistance with
feedings, hob elevated during and post meals.  Pills can be
crushed if necessary or taken whole with liquids.
