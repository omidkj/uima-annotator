resulting in a femur fracture who was transfered from [**Hospital 1474**]
hospital for further management. Her hct was noticed to be 18 on

.
Radiology:
CXR: No pneumothorax or infiltrate detected.  Right internal
jugular venous line in place.
.
Femur:Angulated fracture of the distal right femoral diaphysis.
Unusual cortical contour involving the posterior diaphysis of
the left femur, assessed only on a single view. Multiple
sclerotic foci involving the bilateral long bones.  Diagnostic
considerations include multiple bone islands. Old right femur
intratrochanteric fracture
.
Shoulder/huermus/wrist: Diffuse demineralization, which limits
assessment for fracture, none is seen.
.
C-spine: 1.  Type I anterior subluxation of C3 onto C4 with
compression deformities of C4 through 7 and anterior wedging
noted of C4 and C5.  Without prevertebral soft tissue swelling
these are likely chronic in nature, however, acute subluxation
cannot be completely excluded.  Degenerative cervical spine
changes as noted above.
2.  4 cm nodular lesion of the left lobe of the thyroid with
calcification within.  This likely represents a partially
calcified goiter.
3.  Opacification of some of the mastoid air cells bilaterally
without fracture identified.  Recommend clinical correlation to
rule out fracture in this region.
.
CT head: Multiple hypodensities involving the subcortical white
matter and cortex bilaterally, likely representing infarcts.
The attenuation values of these lesions suggest that they are
subacute, however, this is not definite.  The most recent of
these infarcts appears to be located in the right
temporoparietal lobe.  Correlation with history and neurologic
exam is recommended. Also ? hemorrhagic conversion in one
infarct.
2.  Opacification of some of the mastoid air cells noted
bilaterally without evidence of obvious fracture.  Recommend
correlation with physical exam.
.
Eccho
The left atrium is normal in size. The interatrial septum is
aneurysmal. There  is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. No
masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. Left
ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF 70-80%). The
right ventricular cavity is dilated. Right ventricular systolic
function is normal. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation. (3+) mitral
regurgitation. [3+] tricuspid regurgitation. There is mild
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
.
CT abd/pelvis: 1)  Right-sided dynamic hip screw for old right
intratrochanteric fracture
with recent placement of right intramedullary nail for right
distal femoral
fracture
2) Old left intratrochanteric fracture.
3)  Ventral hernia and stoma in LIF.
4)  Subcutaneous edema and third spacing


Brief Hospital Course:
89 yo woamn with Right femur fracture and Altered mental status.

.
# Femur fracture: Leg was immobilized and the patient was taken
to OR for IM rod placement on [**12-4**].  She did have likely
bleeding into this leg and at [**Hospital1 18**] has required 2U pRBCs pre-op
and 2U pRBCs postop (last tx on [**12-6**]).  She was not started on
post hip fx anticoagulation due to concern of questionable
hemorrhagic conversion of subacute strokes.  Additionally, the
patient was noted to have L hip pain and a hip film appears to
show a l hip fracture as well.  Orthopaedics evaluated; however
due to Ms. [**Known lastname 70666**] grave illness with hypotension, hypoxia, and
multisystem failure her son and health-care proxy decided it
best to forgoe a further operation.
.
# Hypotension: Ms [**Known lastname **] was admitted with borderline
hypotension and was started on a norepinephrine drip on
admission to keep MAPs>60.  She was also given IVF.  The cause
for her hypotension was unclear; she was started on antibiotics
empirically for sepsis; [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 104**] stim test was equivocal so she
was started on hydrocortisone.  Culture data only revealed a
pan-sensitive pseudomonas UTI which was treated with 3d
ciprofloxacin.  Her hydrocortisone was d/c'd when sepsis
appeared less likely.  Because of her + cardiac enzymes an eccho
was ordered which showed severe valvluar regurgiation (3+TR;
3+MR; 1+ AR) which likely contributed to her hypotension.  Due
to concern of total body fluid overload ([**Location (un) **]-sarca) with
hypotension, low urine output, and very low albumin the patient
was given several days of IV albumin which temporarily improved
her blood pressure and allowed diuresis.  However, she
eventually developed refractory hypotension with Afib with RVR,
from which she eventually expired.
.
# CHF: As above Ms [**Known lastname **] was noted to have severe valvular
regurgitation on Eccho (3+MR; 3+ TR; 1+ AR; preserved LVEF).
Because of hypoten
