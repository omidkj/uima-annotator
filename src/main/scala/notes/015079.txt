CXR: Lungs are hyperinflated and the diaphragms are flattened,
consistent with COPD. There is borderline cardiomegaly and mild
unfolding of the aorta. An NG tube is present. Tip overlies the
gastric fundus. There appears to be a small sideport which lies
in the region of the GE junction. No CHF, focal infiltrate, or
effusion is identified. There is minimal subsegmental
atelectasis at both bases. When compared with [**2185-3-28**], no
significant change is identified.

Brief Hospital Course:
1) GI BLEED:  Pt was admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].  Serial Hcts were done.
PPI was started.  Hct dropped to 24 and pt was transfused.  An
EGD was done which showed non bleeding duodenal ulcer and
erosions.  After EGD, his Hct dropped once more to 27 and he was
transfused another unit PRBC.  AFter that, his Hct remained
stable at 32-33 for 36 hours.  He had one further episode of
melena after EGD but this was likely from prior bleed as he had
not had a BM since admission.  He was discharged on PPI and told
to avoid NSAIDs.
