Family History:

Physical Exam:
VITAL SIGNS: VSS
GENERAL: She is alert, pleasant, cachectic, middle-aged woman,
in no acute distress. She is lying in bed. She is alert and
attentive and is cooperative with the examination, which is
improved from before as her aphasia is better. She is mildly
inattentive.
NEUROLOGIC: The patient was alert and oriented x3. She took 2
attmepts to register. She was unable to coung backwards from 20

to 1 because of inattention. She had intact naming to
confrontation, but only able to generate a list of two animals.

She had intact repetition. She followed a [**3-23**] step command. She
had positive right-left disorientation. Recall was actually [**1-23**]
spont, [**2-23**] with hints, [**3-23**] with lists.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms [**Known lastname 69531**] [**Last Name (Titles) 1834**] a left frontal craniotomy on [**12-7**] with
out difficulty.  As the foley was being placed blood was noted
in the vaginal canal.  Post operatively she spent the overnight
in the PACU where her BP was kept below 140.  Her exam was
orientated X2, following commands with word finding difficulty
and right sided weakness.
She was transferred to the floor on day 1 she continued
perservation/word finding difficulties had a right pronator
drift.
A pelvic ultrasound was completed to the vaginal bleeding that
was noted it showed:      PELVIC ULTRASOUND: Transabdominal
evaluation of the pelvis was performed.
Transvaginal examination was not attempted as the patient was
unable to give
consent secondary to mental status change. The uterus is
heterogeneous and
enlarged measuring 8.9 x 7.0 x 8.5 cm. There are several large
hypoechoic
masses consistent with fibroids, the largest located in the mid
uterus
measuring 3.4 x 3.5 x 3.9 cm. The endometrium is poorly
visualized and
distorted by the underlying fibroids. The ovaries are not
visualized.
Superior to the uterine fundus, there is a mixed solid-cystic
lesion measuring
3.6 x 2.7 x 3.9 cm. Two sub-cm echogenic nodules are identified
along the
posterior aspect of the lesion. The origin and etiology of this
mass is
unclear. [**Name2 (NI) **] other lesions are identified. There is no free
pelvic fluid. A
1.5 cm thin- walled anechoic simple cyst is seen within the mid
right kidney.
There is no evidence of calculi or hydronephrosis. The patient
is status post
left nephrectomy. No tumor recurrence is seen within the
visualized surgical
bed.

The GYN service did not see the patient, they felt that the
bleeding was related to endometrial thickening and did not
warrent an inpatient consult and she should follow up as an
outpatient.  An appointment was scheduled for early [**Month (only) 1096**].

She was seen by PT/OT which recommended home with PT.
A follow up MRI showed:
The present study shows high T1 signal, apparently blood
products, within the left frontal metastatic tumor resection
bed. There is also a surrounding ring of contrast enhancement.
Given the appearance of the mass on the prior studies, the
enhancement raises the possibility of residual tumor. There are
additional, somewhat gyral shaped areas of contrast enhancement
subjacent to the craniotomy flap and extending towards the left
frontal tumor resection bed. Some of these could be vessels, but
they do appear somewhat more prominent than was seen on the
prior study of [**2187-12-7**]. Thus, either altered vascular
status secondary to the recent resection, leptomeningeal tumor
and/or infection all have to be considered in the differential
diagnosis of this finding. There is pachymeningeal enhancement
subjacent to the craniotomy defect, a finding which can simply
be due to the surgery itself. The degree of mass effect upon the
adjacent left lateral ventricle appears unaltered. It is very
difficult to demonstrate the enhancement of the left cerebellar
lesion at this time, and this enhancement is only faintly
discernible on the coronal and possibly the sagittal
post-contrast images as well. The edema associated with both
lesions is re-demonstrated, as are the numerous punctate areas
of elevated FLAIR signal within the white matter of both
cerebral hemispheres, probably representing chronic small vessel
infarcts.

The present study shows susceptibility within the left
cerebellar metastasis, raising the question of interval
hemorrhage compared to the prior susceptibility scan of [**11-14**], [**2187**] (more recent intervening MR studies did not have a
susceptibility sequence). The size of this susceptibility area
conforms to the previously noted area of contrast enhancement at
this locale. Finally, there is re-demonstration of what is
likely a 1 cm right maxillary antral mucous retention cyst.

Neuro oncology, Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 4253**], also saw the patient who
recommended: to follow up in the brain tumor clinic.  Where her
films, path, and history in our BTC
conference will be reviewed  that morning and make the decision
on whether to give
her WBXRT vs SRS. L cerebellar met was already treated with SRS
about 10 days ago.

2. Cerebral edema. Can continue wean as planned, if pt worse,
would hold wean and have them call our office for further
instructions.

3. Seizures. Continue Keppra at 1000mg [**Hospital1 **].

4. Aphasia. This has improved and should continue to do so as
edema from surgery resolves.
