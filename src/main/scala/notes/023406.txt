Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1377**]
Chief Complaint:
Altered mental status
Transplant evaluation

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
(per OMR and report)
7e yo F with autoimmune hepatitis dx [**2173**] initially on
azathioprine and Imuran, complicated by cirrhosis transferred
from OSH for persistent altered mental status with question of
possible transplant evaluation.
.
Per OMR and OSH record, patient was doing well until she was
taken off of azathioprine [**1-15**] pancytopenia few weeks prior to
presentation.  This was done because of pancytopenia.  Since
then, she had increased abdominal girth as well as elevated
bilirubin and amoonia.  She was placed on rifaximin and
restarted azathioprine 75 mg daily, and prednisone.  However,
there was worsening confusion, lethargy, and weakness.  She was
admitted to the outside hospital on [**2177-9-18**] because of
worsening confusion and unable to answer questions
appropriately.  She was found to have hyponatremia 125, low
serium osmolality at 254, urine sodium < 30, creatinine of 0.5.
Initial CT head was ? temporal lobe infarct.  Abd X ray showed
constipation.  In addition to the AMS, she was also found to
have UTI.  EEG showed encephalopathy and left hemisphere
pathology.  She was treated with rifaximin, azathioprine 75 mg,
prednisone 50 mg, lactulose, ciprofloxacine.  Given her poor po
intake, she was started on enteral feeding.  Per patient's
husband, patient appeared well about a week prior to transfer,
then started to become more somnolent again.
.
Per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5456**], patient was transferred in the hope that she
will be able to get a liver transplant.  She received FFP and
platelets today prior to transfer.  Per him, patient has been on
lactulose and rifaximin.  Mental status not improved despite
negative CT/MRI.  Apparently was tried on TF but with high
residual.  VSS but on 2L NC.
.
Of note, patient was referred to Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 679**] in [**Month (only) 216**] for
management of the flair in the setting of d/c of azathioprine
[**1-15**] pancytopenia as part of the cataract work up.  She was
restarted on prednisone 60 mg and 50 mg azathioprine
.
On the floor, patient is somnolent, unable to answer questions
but opens eyes to commands

ammonia 63 PT 21.8, INR 2.1, PTT 35.5

Micro:
- blood cultures: no growth since [**2177-9-18**]
- urine culture [**9-24**]: no growth
- urine culture [**9-18**]: E. coli > 100,000, pan-sensitive

EKG at OSH [**9-26**]: NSR, no PR prolongation, narrow QRS, no ST, or
T changes.  However, does have significant baseline artifact.  T
wave is flatten throughout

Images:
- CT head w/o contrast [**2177-9-19**]: mild global cerebral atrophy c/w
age.  Previous right frontal burhole.  Relative hypodensity to
the right temporal lobe, ? acute vs. old, given no prior
imaging.  Asymmetric to the left.  No midline shift or mass
effect.  Scattered periventricular and subcortical white matter
hypodensities, nonspecific, but can be seen in small vessel
disease.  Mild mucosal thickening within the sphenoid sinuses.
- MRI head [**9-20**]: findings on CT likely artifact.  no evidence of
infarct or acute abnormality within the brain parenchyma.  No
evidence of abnormality within the right temporal lobe.
Findings on CT likely artifactual.  Mild periventricular and
subcortical white matter FLAIR signal hyperintensities,
non-specific, can be seen in small vessel ischemic change
- CT head [**2177-9-23**]: no midline shifts.  prominent [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white
matter junctions but symmetric
- Abd X ray [**2177-9-19**]: increased density to the abdomen may
suggest underlying ascites
- EEG [**9-28**]: grossly abnormal recording suggesting bihemispheric
cerebral dysfunction.  Most consistent with encephalopathy
regardless of cause.  + left sided greater preponderance of
slowing as well as phase reversing activity suggesting
underlying structural pathology in this distribution.  Can
represent neoplasm, stroke, other, or nidus for paroxysmal
irritability and requires clinical and radiologic correlation.
- AP CXR [**9-28**]: proximal port over the fundus of the stomach,
diffuse prominence of the interstital markings bilaterally,
perhaps with increased ensity at the left lung base.
- CXR portable [**9-28**]: increased density at the left lung base
compatible with atelectasis in the LLL, infiltrate in the LLL,
and perhaps pleural fluid.  Minor atelectasis in the right
mid-lower lung
