History of Present Illness:
(Per chart, family, nursing home staff)  67 year old woman with
multiple vascular risk factors s/p CABG and porcine MVR in [**12-7**],
recent left leg cellulitis, now found unresponsive at nursing
home at about 10:15 a.m. today. Per her daughter she has been
intermittently confused since the left leg cellulitis a week
ago, but she has been conversant and interactive.  Today at
around 10 a.m. she was  speaking with her daughter on the phone
and complained that she felt very short of breath, and she also
sounded confused.  She hung up and about 10-15 minutes later the
physical therapist found her sitting unresponsive in her chair.
She had been incontinent of urine, which is unusual for her. Per
the nurse on her unit she was not weak on one side, did not have
a facial droop, but had her eyes half open and was moaning, and
did not respond to their voices or touch. BG was 130's.  EMS
arrived and reportedly noted a right hemiparesis.  She was
brought to [**Hospital6 17032**], where she was
described to be "aphasic," not following commands, but
withdrawing all four extremities to noxious stimuli.  No further
details of the neurologic exam are
available.  Her blood pressure was 161/79 and HR was 51, RR 20
and she was afebrile at 99.6.  She did not have a gag and was
intubated for airway protection.  She received a total of 4 mg
of Ativan surrounding the intubation but there is no report of
any improvement in her mental status with this.  She had a head
CT which reportedly showed a subacute right frontoparietal
infarct.
Per records she was not given tPA due to her recent cardiac
surgery. She did receive 600 mg ASA PR. She was then transferred
to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation.  There has reportedly been no
change in her status since her initial presentation.

Review of systems:  She was recently discharged on [**1-16**] after an
admission from rehab for fever and altered mental status, found
to have left leg cellulitis and likely C.diff.  She complained
of SOB while on the phone with her daughter this morning.
Otherwise, as above.

Presumed C. diff., Recent left leg cellulitis


Social History:
She has a 30 pack-year history of smoking; she quit in [**2186**].
She does not consume EtOH. Denies illicit substance use.  She
lives alone and has five daughters.


Family History:

Physical Exam:
T afebrile   HR 50's  BP 170's/70's  Intubated, NOT sedated
General appearance: 67 year old woman intubated in NAD
HEENT:  NC/AT, neck supple with full ROM
CV: Regular rate and rhythm without murmurs, rubs or gallops. No
carotid bruits.
Lungs: Clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Abdomen: Soft, nontender, nondistended, no hsm or masses
palpated
Extremities: no clubbing, cyanosis or edema, erythematous
indurated area on left calf c/w prior cellulitis

Mental Status:  Intubated, not sedated.  Eyes are closed, does
not open to sternal rub or voice.  After stimulated for several
minutes, eyes are half open. Does not follow commands.

Cranial Nerves:  Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light
2.5>2 mm.  Fundi could not be well visualized. She blinked to
threat bilaterally when eyes held slightly open.  Gaze was
midline and conjugate.  She would not track visual stimuli. When
her eyelids were held open her eyes occasionally drifted
downwards, then slowly came back up.  There did not seem to be a
Bell's phenomenon.  Corneals were present bilaterally.  She
grimaced to nasal tickle bilaterally, perhaps more vigorously on
the right.  Facial symmetry was difficult to assess due to ETT.
There were no OCR's present.  She did not gag.   Tongue
position/palate elevation could not be assessed due to
intubation.

Motor System: Diminished tone throughout.  Occasionally
spontaneously wiggles toes, but no other spontaneous movement.
With deep nailbed pressure, flexes both arms and legs equally.
Once or twice extended either arm into stimulus briefly, then
flexed.

Reflexes: Deep tendon reflexes are a brisk 2+ and symmetric.
Plantar responses are extensor bilaterally.  No [**Doctor Last Name 937**].

Sensory: Responds to deep nailbed pressure as above.

Coordination, Gait:  Could not be assessed.

for detection of acute infarction.

Brief Hospital Course:
67 year old woman with multiple vascular risk factors, 3 weeks
s/p 3 vessel CABG and porcine MVR, not on coumadin, found
unresponsive and incontinent at 10:15am.  Last well when she
spoke with daughter on the phone at 10am.  Initially taken to
[**Hospital3 **] where thought to have R sided weakness and
aphasia.  Transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].

Neuro:  Code stroke called and neurology evaluated patient.
Initially, patient was sedated by Ativan. Thought to have either
an epileptic process or a brainstem process and taken for stat
MRI/MRA after CT scan found to be essentially negative except
for subacute or chronic R frontal infarct.  MRI/MRA revealed
large mid-basilar to top of basilar clot with diffusion changes
in bilateral pons and in R MCA distribution. Mechanism of stroke
likely cardioembolic given multiple vascular territory
involvement. Patient was not eligible for IV t-[**MD Number(3) 6360**]
presentation at >3 hours.

After extensive discussion with family re: risks and benefits of
intervention stroke attending and interventional neurosurgeons,
patient was taken to the INR suite for consideration of clot
retrieval or intra-arterial therapy. Patient had extensive
vertebral and subclavian origin stenosis and were unable to
deploy a clot retrieval device.  She did receive 2mg of IA t-PA
into L vertebral artery which was hypoplastic and she underwent
stenting of the R veretebral artery. Family members were
informed. We will ask cardiology to consult on patient tonight
given increased troponin.

Post Neuroradiology procedure, patient was admitted to neurology
ICU for close monitoring and neuro checks: q15 min x 2 hr post
TPA, then q30 min x 6h, then
q1h x 16h, then per routine.

Avoided instrumentation (foley, arterial puncture) x 24 hrs and
antiplatelet or anticoag x 24 hrs.  Patient was started on
integrillin gtt per INR service for 24 hours.  Repeat head CT
was negative for intracranial hemorrhage and was otherwise
unchanged.  The following morning patient's exam was unchanged.
Discussed locked-in syndrome and the associated of function she
would have.  Family meeting was held at 11AM: After long
discussion with family who expressed understanding of the
patient's status in their words, patient was made comfort
measures only according to patient's wish not to be ventilator
dependent or have a tracheostomy.  Patient was made comfort
measures only which was confirmed with TICU team and NeuroICU
attending. Pt. expirted at 11:50 AM with family at the bedside.
Autopsy was declined.

CV: Kept <180 systolic and <105 diastolic; PRN labetalol to
achieve this goal.  Cardiac enzymes were elevat
