Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1505**]
Chief Complaint:
Progressive dyspnea on exertion

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Aortic Valve Replacement (#21mm St.[**Male First Name (un) 923**] Mechanical)/Mitral Valve
Replacement (#29mm St.[**Male First Name (un) 923**] Mechanical)-[**5-23**]


History of Present Illness:
58 year-old gentleman who has had progressive dyspnea on
exertion. He also had a prior history of aortic stenosis and
underwent cardiac catheterization in [**Month (only) 547**] which showed no
significant coronary artery disease with severe aortic stenosis
and mitral regurgitation. Echocardiogram performed on [**2131-1-31**] showed posterior mitral valve leaflet prolapse with
moderate-to-severe MR, severe aortic stenosis with aortic valve
area of 0.6 cm2 (peak gradient of 39 mm and mean gradient of 22
mm), and ejection fraction of 55%.Dr.[**Last Name (STitle) **] was consulted for
surgical intervention and valvular replacement.


Past Medical History:
metabolic syndrome,
hypertension, non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, mitral
regurgitation, aortic stenosis, aortic insufficiency,
obstructive sleep apnea, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,
and pulmonary hypertension.


Social History:
He works as a contractor.  His last dental
examination was two months ago.  He denies using tobacco
currently but has used it occasionally in the past.  However, he
does have significant alcohol problem as he admits to six to
nine beers per day...patient states he was quit drinking ETOH
over the last month.


Family History:
His father had coronary artery bypass surgery in his 50s and
died in his early 60s.  A strong family history is also present
of diabetes.

Physical Exam:
On exam, his heart rate is 73, respiratory rate 16, and blood
pressure of 103/74.  He is well developed and well nourished in
no apparent distress.  Skin was unremarkable and intact.  His
EOMs were intact.  His pupils were equally round and reactive to
light and accommodation.  Neck was supple with full range of
motion and no JVD or carotid bruitswere appreciated.  Lungs were
clear bilaterally.  Heart revealsa regular rate and rhythm with
a
grade II/VI holosystolic
murmur.  Abdomen was soft, nontender, and nondistended with
positive bowel sounds.  Extremities were warm and well perfused
without any edema or varicosities.  He was alert and oriented
x3.
He is moving all extremities and had a nonfocal neurologic exam.

He had 2+ bilateral femoral DP, PT, and radial pulses.

Findings
LEFT VENTRICLE: Suboptimal technical quality, a focal LV wall
motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Low normal LVEF. No
resting LVOT gradient.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.
Paradoxic septal motion consistent with prior cardiac surgery.

AORTIC VALVE: Bileaflet aortic valve prosthesis (AVR). Normal
AVR gradient. No AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Bileaflet mitral valve prosthesis (MVR). Normal
MVR gradient. Trivial MR. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the
severity of MR may be significantly UNDERestimated.]

TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets. Mild [1+] TR.
Mild PA systolic hypertension.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Pulmonic valve not well seen.

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: Suboptimal image quality - poor parasternal
views. Suboptimal image quality - bandages, defibrillator pads
or electrodes.
Conclusions
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion
abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. A bileaflet aortic
valve prosthesis is present and appears well-seated. The
transaortic gradient is normal for this prosthesis. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. A bileaflet mitral valve prosthesis is
present and appears well-seated. The transmitral gradient is
normal for this prosthesis. Trivial mitral regurgitation is
seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral
regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.] There is
mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
[**5-23**] Mr.[**Known lastname 82119**] went to the operating room and underwent Aortic
Valve Replacement (#21mm St.[**Male First Name (un) 923**] Mechanical)/Mitral Valve
Replacement (#29mm St.[**Male First Name (un) 923**] Mechanical).Cross clamp time=126
minutes. Cardiopulmonary Bypass time=148 minutes. Please refer
to Dr[**Last Name (STitle) **] operative report for further details. He
tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to the CVICU in
critical but stable condition, requiring pressors and inotrope
to optimize cardiac output. He awoke neurologically intact and
was extubated without difficulty. All drips were weaned to off.
Beta-blocker was initially held off due to a first degree AV
block. Anticoagulation was started with Coumadin, and bridged
with a Heparin drip for therapeutic INR with mechanical valves.
[**Last Name (un) **] was consulted for glucose control. Low dose Beta-blocker
was ultimately started due to his increased heart rate.  His
rate blocked down, beta-blocker discontinued , and
Electrophysiology was consulted. POD#9 PPM was placed secondary
to heart block. EP interrogated the PPM and continued to follow.
The remainder of his postoperative course was essentially
uneventful. Discharge was dependent upon therapeutic INR.  On
POD# 17/8 Mr.[**Known lastname 82119**] was cleared
