Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: [**Age over 90 **] yo [**Age over 90 8003**] speaking female with MMP including CHF (LVEF
55%) sz d/o and CAD, presents to ED with hypoxia, hypotension,
and bilateral patchy infiltrates on CXR.
.
1. Respiratory distress: Based on the history of sudden onset
dyspnea with worsening O2 sats and her clinical exam (tachypnea,
diffuse crackles) patient was felt to be in CHF.  She was ruled
out for an MI by enzymes and diuresed gentally.  Her repiratory
status, clinical exam, and subjective symptoms improved with
diuresis.
Initially in the unit the patient required dobutamine for
pressure support but this was quickly weaned and her BP remained
stable for the remainder of the admission.
.
2. Possible pneumonia: Afebrile on admission w/ WBC of 6.3 and
75% neuts.  CXR was inconclusive for pna and the patient was
started on levoflox.   When she improved with diuresis the
antibiotics were stopped.  She remained afebrile for the
remainder of the admission.
.
3. Chronic renal insufficiency: Baseline Cr 2.0, creatinine 1.8
on discharge.
.
4. Hyponatremia: Na of 125 on admission, resolved to 140's by
the time she was in the intensive care unit with no
intervention.  ? lab error.

5. h/o CAD: History is unclear. Ruled out for MI.  Cont on
bblocker, statin, asa.
