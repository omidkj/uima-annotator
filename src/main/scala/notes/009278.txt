History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 76yo female with HTN, HL, R lung mass,
rheumatoid arthritis, depression, s/p open cholecystectomy and
hysterectomy, who re-presented to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED on [**2126-8-19**] with
nausea and abdominal pain just 3 days after she was discharged
from this hospital following conservative management of a
presumed ileus. She initially presented on [**2125-8-5**] with 1 day of
nausea, vomitting, and abdominal pain. She refused an NGT during
that admission, was managed conservatively with bowel rest and
IVFs. CT was consistent with generalized ileus. A colonoscopy
revealed severe diverticulosis in the sigmoid colon and rectum
with areas of lumenal narrowing, but no inflammation or
obstructing mass. When she was able to tolerate POs, she was
discharged home.
.
The patient felt well and tolerated a regular diet at hoome for
2 days. At 4am on the day of admission [**2125-8-18**], "all hell broke
loose". She urinated, had a bowel movement, and then experienced
sudden onset of abdominal pain. She describes the pain as an
ache that progressed to sharp pain. It is intermittent. She
localizes the pain to a band passing from her L lower quadrant
across her abdomen to the R upper quadrant. She had dry heaves
initially which progressed to severe nausea.
.
The patient denies any fevers, chills, chest pain, SOB,
dizziness, or bloody/black tarry stools.
.
In the ED, vitals were T 98.0 BP 128/68 AR 107 RR 24 O2 sat 94%
RA. She received Morphine, Zofran, and IVFs.
.
Currently, she denies pain. She complains of significant
abdominal bloating, distension, and dry mouth. Since admission,
the NGT has drained 1 liter of thick brown fluid. She has not
had a bowel movement or passed gas since 4am [**2125-8-18**].

Relevant Imaging:
1)CT scan abdomen/pelvis ([**8-18**]): 1.  Interval resolution of
ascites.
2.  Multiple dilated loops of small bowel, with fluid distension
of the colon. There is, however, caliber change at junction of
descending/sigmoid colon, as was noted on the previous study.
These findings likely represent ileus, however, partial
obstruction cannot be totally excluded. 3.  Severe
atherosclerotic disease of the abdominal aorta and other
vessels.

[**2125-8-13**] Colonoscopy: Multiple diverticula were seen in the
sigmoid colon and rectum. Diverticulosis appeared to be severe
with areas of luminal narrowing.


Brief Hospital Course:
76 yo female with HTN, HL, lung mass, and rheumatoid arthritis
admitted for recurrent idiopathic ileus ([**2125-8-18**]), with hospital
course complicated by acute decompensation in respiratory status
due to saddle PE and heparin induced thrombocytopenia.

# Respiratory distress - Pt with acute decompensation in
respiratory status at 12pm on [**8-22**].  Pt was sitting in comode,
and upon standing oxygen saturation dropped into the 80's.  She
was placed on high flow O2 and O2 rose into the 90's.  However,
pt remained tachypneic and tachycardic.  Pt had slight wheezing
on physical exam so nebulizer treatments were given, dose of
solumedrol was given as well but no improvement seen.  Lasix was
then given for possibility of overload with no improvement.  Pt
became hypercarbic and continued with increased work of
breathing so she was intbuted and placed on AC mechanical
ventilation; she had a recent associated episode of RUQ, right
flank pain ([**8-21**]) two days prior which was concerning for
pleuritic chest pain and PE.  A V/Q scan to eval for PE was
indeterminate; LENIS were negative.  TTE showed dilated right
ventricle which was could be correlated with PE.  MRA of chest
showed saddle pulmonary embolus.  (Note: CT contraindicated
secondary to an iodine allergy).  Right IJ central line placed
and the patient was placed on levophed drip with good response.
The patient was not felt to be a candidate for TPA due to her
lung mass.  She was placed on an argatroban drip for
anticoagulation adjusted for a PTT goal of 60-80.  Levophed was
weaned.  During this episode, the patient was intubated for
respiratory distress, but upon discharge from the MICU was
extubated successfully extubated and transferred on 2L NC
saturating between 96-100%.  She was also bridged to coumadin
anticoagulation upon transfer with goal INR of 2.5.  She will
likely need coumadin for long term anticoagulation.  Plans are
to repeat ECHO as outpatient in [**3-13**] months to assess long term
cardiac damage s/p PE. Pt was successfully bridged on argatroban
to coumadin and currently has INR =2.3.

# Heparin induced thrombocytopenia - Pt had a drop in her
platelet count by >50% from 132 to 56.  Discontinued all heparin
products when drop occurred as the concern was for HIT since
this drop in platelets ocurred after induction of heparin drip
s/p PE.  Positive HIT antibodies. Upon discharge from MICU
platelets were stable and within normal limits.  She was started
on argatroban as above for her PE with transition to coumadin.
Upon discharge from the hospital, pt with platelets stable =
313.

# Bacteremia - Gram positive cocci (Coagulase negative
staphylococcus) grew from arterial
