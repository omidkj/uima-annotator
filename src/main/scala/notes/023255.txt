HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 74-year-old white male
with ischemic cardiomyopathy, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation,
atrial flutter, status post coronary artery bypass graft in
[**2100**] (3 vessels) brought into the hospital initially for an

During the electrophysiology study, he developed atrial
flutter spontaneously.  After ablation of atrial flutter, he
developed left atrial tachycardia then atrial fibrillation.
Atrial fibrillation persisted despite ibutilide, ventricular rate
was approximately 40 BPM.  The patient developed hypotension with
a systolic blood pressure in the 70s which responded to V
pacing and low dose dopamine infusion. A dual chamber pacemaker
was then placed.  The patient developed monomorphic ventricular
tachycardia during V lead placement, and was shocked at 200
joules.  At the end of the procedure the blood pressure remained
low when dobutamine was stopped.  An echocardiogram revealed a
small pericardial effusion with no evidence of tamponade.  RV
perforation was felt to have occurred probably during EPS/
ablation.  A repeat echo 1 hour later revealed no increase in
size of the effusion, and no evidence of tamponade.

The patient was transferred to the Coronary Care Unit on
dopamine pressure support.

112/56, respiratory rate was 23, pulse oximetry was 94% on 2
liters, dopamine drip.  In general, an elderly male,
lethargic but easily arousable.  Alert and oriented times
three.  Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat examination
revealed mucous membranes were moist, edentulous.  Pupils
were equal, round, and reactive to light.  Extraocular
movements were intact.  Neck revealed jugular venous
distention to 9 cm.  No bruits.  Cardiovascular examination
revealed a [**3-16**] holosystolic murmur at the left lower sternal
border.  A regular rate and rhythm.  Pulmonary examination
was clear to auscultation anteriorly.  The abdomen was obese,
soft, nontender, and nondistended.  Normal abdominal bowel
sounds.  Extremities revealed no cyanosis, clubbing, or
edema.  Feet were dry with multiple ulcers.  Dorsalis pedis
and posterior tibialis pulses were dopplerable.  Groin
revealed left venous sheath was in place.  There was
ecchymosis present.  No bruits.  Right groin had dry blood,
no bruits.

PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:  Initial
laboratory results revealed a white blood cell count
was 20.5, hematocrit was 35.1, platelets were 245.  INR
was 1.4.  Chemistry-7 revealed sodium was 141, potassium was
4.4,  chloride was 104, bicarbonate was 22, blood urea
nitrogen was 43, creatinine was 1.2, and blood glucose
was 172.  ALT was 19 and AST was 22.  Hemoglobin A1c was 8.5,
thyroid-stimulating hormone was 3.3.  Creatine kinase
was 897.

RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:   Last catheterization in [**2112-11-8**]
showed severe 3-vessel disease, patent left internal mammary
artery to left anterior descending artery, and saphenous vein
graft to obtuse marginal.  Pulmonary capillary wedge pressure
at the time was 10, ejection fraction was 40%, normal
right-sided pressures.

Initial electrocardiogram revealed atrial fibrillation of
about 63 beats per minute, left anterior descending artery
right bundle-branch block, left anterior vesicular block.  No
acute ST changes.  Q wave in II, III, and aVF.  Poor R wave
progression.

INITIAL ASSESSMENT:  This is a 74-year-old male with a
history of paroxysmal atrial flutter, status post inferior
myocardial infarction, status post ablation and pacemaker
placement complicated by multiple rhythms and right
ventricular perforation.

HOSPITAL COURSE:

1.  CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM:  (a)  Pump:  The patient had a
known ejection fraction of about 35% and hypotension after
pacemaker placement.  He was started on dopamine.  The
patient was slowly weaned off dopamine.  All of his
antihypertensives were held initially.

The patient had a repeat echocardiogram the following morning to
evaluate for hemopericardium which was negative and showed a
decreased size of the pericardial effusion.

Once his blood pressure normalized, the patient was restarted
on ACE inhibitor and his usual Lasix regimen. The patient
tolerated this well.

(b)  Rhythm:  Status post biventricular pacemaker placement,
ventricularly paced.  The patient was kept on telemetry.  He
had no ectopic events.  The patient was started on aspirin.
He was to be restarted on Coumadin at a later date.  The
patient was to follow up in the Device Clinic. The patient
was also started on sotalol 80 mg p.o. b.i.d.

(c)  Coronary arteries:  The patient has known coronary
artery disease.  A lipid panel was checked.  ALT and AST were
within normal limits.  The patient was started on Lipitor and
kept on folic acid during his hospital course.

2.  PULMONARY SYSTEM:  The patient's oxygen saturations were
stable during his hospital course.  The patient had a cough
with greenish sputum which he said was chronic toward the end
of his hospital course.  A chest x-ray was checked which was
negative for pneumonia.

3.  RENAL SYSTEM:   The patient with a known history of
chronic renal insufficiency.  He had a stable blood urea
nitrogen and creatinine throughout his hospital course.

4.  ENDOCRINE SYSTEM:  The patient with known type 2 diabetes
mellitus.  The patient was kept on his home doses of insulin.
He was also covered with fingersticks q.i.d. and a regular
insulin sliding-scale.  The patient also had known
hypothyroidism.  His Synthroid was continued.

6.  GENITOURINARY SYSTEM:  The patient had his terazosin for
blood pressure reasons.  He initially had some urinary
retention with one liter of urine output once a Foley
catheter was placed.  The Foley was able to be discontinued.
The patient had some questionable urinary incontinence toward
the end of his hospital course.  The patient was to not take
terazosin on discharge to home; to restart at a later date.

7.  OVERALL:  The patient was lethargic initially in the
hospital course but brightened toward the end.  The patient
was able to ambulate with Physical Therapy, and they felt
that [**Hospital 3058**] rehabilitation was needed, but the patient's
daughter refused and requested that he go home with [**Hospital6 3429**] and home Physical Therapy services; and
this was done.
