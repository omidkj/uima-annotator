STUDIES:
=========
RENAL U.S.  [**2143-11-8**]
IMPRESSION:
1. Hyperechoic focus without shadowing in the left renal pelvis
may represent sloughed papilla in the collecting system (renal
papillary necrosis). Similarly, the hyperechoic focus at the
right mid collecting system may represent papillary necrosis,
although review of static images make it difficult to
distinguish from hilar fat.
2. Bilateral renal cysts. No evidence of
hydronephrosis/obstruction.
.
BILAT LOWER EXT VEINS PORT  [**2143-11-8**]
IMPRESSION:
1. Occlusive thrombosis involving the right popliteal vein,
superficial femoral vein, and common femoral vein.
2. No DVT involving the left lower extremity.
.
PORTABLE ABDOMEN  [**2143-11-8**]
IMPRESSION: Nonspecific nonobstructive bowel gas pattern.
Limited evaluation for the presence of free air. Follow up
upright or left side down decubitus radiographs are recommended
if clinical suspicion exists for free air.
.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP) [**2143-11-8**]
IMPRESSION:
1 Right IJ central line with its tip in the right atrium.
Retraction by approximately 5 cm is advised.
2. Left basilar airspace opacity, possibly representing
atelectasis and/or pneumonia.
.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2143-11-8**]
IMPRESSION: Process involving the left CP angle, not present on
the remote study, which may represent early pneumonic
infiltrate.
.
EKG [**2143-11-8**]
Sinus tachycardia with delayed R wave transition. Low limb lead
voltage.
Non-specific ST-T wave abnormalities. No previous tracing
available for
comparison.
TRACING #1
.
EKG [**2143-11-8**]
Normal sinus rhythm with diffuse low voltage. Left atrial
abnormality.
Diffuse ST-T wave flattening. Compared to tracing #1 there has
been no
diagnostic interval change.
TRACING #2
.
CT ABDOMEN AND PELVIS W/O CONTRAST  [**2143-11-11**]
IMPRESSION:
1. Moderate left hydronephrosis and hydroureter extending to the
left ureteropelvic junction, at which point an intraluminal
filling defect is suggested. Direct visualization may be
considered to exclude a mass given the elevated creatinine.
2. Additional 2-mm distal left ureteral calculus is
non-obstructing.
3. Sigmoid diverticulosis, without evidence of diverticulitis.
4. Cholelithiasis.
5. New 13-mm hepatic hypoattenuating lesion is incompletely
evaluated. While this may represent focal fatty infiltration,
given the patient's history of breast cancer, further evaluation
with ultrasound is recommended. Alternatively, if the patient's
creatinine normalizes, an MRI may be considered.
6. A 4- mm non- calcified pulmonary nodule. A followup chest CT
is recommended in 12 months. At this time, asymmetric right
upper lobe pleural thickening can also be reevaluated.
7. Presumed pancreatic tail cystic lesion is likely benign given
equivocal growth over several years.
8. Moderate bilateral pleural effusions with adjacent
atelectasis.
.
PORTABLE ABDOMEN  [**2143-11-11**]
IMPRESSION:
1. Appropriately positioned nasogastric tube with tip not
visualized on current film but likely within the second and
third portion of the duodenum.
2. Bibasilar pulmonary opacity which may represent atelectasis
and/or pneumonia. Please refer to dedicated chest radiograph for
further details.
.
Portable TTE (Complete) Done [**2143-11-11**]
The left atrium is normal in size. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and systolic
function (LVEF>55%). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an
increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. Right
ventricular systolic function is normal. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Physiologic mitral regurgitation
is seen (within normal limits). There is borderline pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is an anterior space which
most likely represents a fat pad.
IMPRESSION: Mild tricuspid regurgitation. Aortic valve
sclerosis. Mild mitral leaflet thickening. No focal vegetation
seen.
.
ANTEGRADE UROGRAPHY  [**2143-11-12**]
IMPRESSION:
1. Mildly dilated left renal pelvis and left ureter.
2. Successful placement of an 8 French APD percutaneous
nephrostomy tube under ultrassonographic and fluoroscopic
guidance, with pigtail coiled in the left renal pelvis. Tube is
connected to an external bag.
.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2143-11-12**]
FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**11-9**], relatively low
lung volumes persist. Streaky atelectatic opacifications are
again noted, especially at the right base. Of course, it is
difficult to unequivocally exclude pneumonia.  The right IJ
catheter has been removed.
.
CT SINUS/MANDIBLE/MAXILLOFACIAL W/O CONTRAST  [**2143-11-14**]
IMPRESSION:
1. Normal orbits and no abnormalities of the orbital apices.
However, MRI would provide better evaluation of this region.
2. Paranasal sinus changes as described above.
.
LIVER OR GALLBLADDER US (SINGLE ORGAN)  [**2143-11-15**]
IMPRESSION:
1. Liver normal; lesions described on prior CT not visualized.
2. Cholelithiasis, without evidence for acute cholecystitis.
.
RENAL U.S.  [**2143-11-18**]
IMPRESSION: No hydronep
