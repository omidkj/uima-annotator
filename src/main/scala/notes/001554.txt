History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 75713**] is a 71 year-old male with history of right upper
lobe lung cancer s/p right thoracotomy with right upper
lobectomy and en-block chest wall resection with decortication
of the middle and lower lobes. The procedure was  difficult
procedure and complicated by prolonged hospital stay due to
bronchopleural fistula. He returned for followup on [**2101-1-13**] with
improving
postoperative chest discomfort, yet reported shortness of
breath, nonproductive cough, and bilateral lower extremity
edema, despite being recently placed on lasix by his PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) **] had
a low-grade fever to 100.1 the evening prior to his followup
appointment. CXR ([**2101-1-13**]) revealed right hydropneumothorax. He
was subsequently admitted to the Thoracic Surgery service for
further workup and management.

Pertinent Results:
[**2101-1-13**]: CXR (on admit)
No evidence of remaining aerated pulmonary tissue in right-sided
hemithorax and central right-sided airways only followed 2-3 cm
distal to the bifurcation. A hydropneumothorax is present on the
right side with an air-fluid level above thoracic arch. Multiple
right-sided upper rib defects consistent with chest wall
reconstruction. Mild-to-moderate mediastinal shift towards right
side indicative of volume loss. The left-sided hemithorax shows
grossly normal appearance of the lung without evidence of acute
infiltrates or congestive pattern.
.
[**2101-1-13**]: Pleural fluid:
NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS
.
[**2101-1-25**]: ECHO:
Left atrium is mildly dilated. Mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. Left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally
normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is a small
pericardial effusion.
.
[**2101-1-27**]: CT Chest
IMPRESSION:
1. New, large hematoma in the right upper chest, predominantly
pleural, despite two apical pleural tubes; new submuscular, R
chest wall hematoma.
2. Persistent right pleural thickening and worsening
atelectasis.
3. New small left pleural effusion.
.
[**2101-2-3**]: CT Chest
IMPRESSION:
1. Resolving large hematoma in the right upper chest with
reexpansion of the right upper lobe volume.
2. Persistent right extrathoracic hematoma with less gas.
3. Resolving left pleural effusion.
.
[**2101-2-9**]: Renal U/S: No evidence of hydronephrosis
.
[**2101-2-10**]: CXR (prior to discharge)
IMPRESSION: No relevant changes in right hemithorax. Minimal
increase in a subtle perihilar, but diffuse opacity in the left
lung.

Brief Hospital Course:
Neuro: On admit, the patient was given oral pain medication, on
which he reported adequate pain relief. Following right VATS and
post-operative intubation, he was placed on propofol gtt and
given dilaudid IV until extubated. When able to tolerate po, he
was placed on oral pain medication. Prior to discharge, his pain
was adequately controlled on tylenol.
.
Cardiopulmonary: Following admission, the patient underwent a
bronchoscopy on [**2101-1-14**] which revealed a small amount of
granulation tissue at the base of cords c/w prior intubation
trauma, healthy appearing surgical stump, mucous in RLL, and
edematous RML/RLL bronchi. Based on the right hydropneumothorax
revealed on CXR, a right apical chest tube was inserted (drained
~1000cc serosanginous) at the bedside and pleural fluid cultures
were obtained. tPA was placed through the tube prior to
obtaining CT Chest on [**2101-1-17**]. On [**2101-1-18**], due to the persistent
right effusion, the patient underwent a flexible bronchoscopy,
right video-assisted thoracoscopy with drainage, and
decortication. Two additional right chest tubes were placed
while in the operating room. The patient tolerated the procedure
well, yet post-operatively, was electively intubated following
right hemithorax whiteout demonstrated on CXR. He was
subsequently transferred to the ICU and underwent bronchoscopy
which revealed moderate inflammation and edema in the distal
trachea and mainstem bronchi with a mucous plug in the bronchus
intermedius and right middle lobe takeoff. Repeat bronchoscopy
on [**2101-1-19**] revealed a small amount thick mucoid secretions in
the LLL, with an intact RUL stump. Following bronchoscopy, he
was weaned to extubate without incident. On [**2101-1-20**], he was
transferred to [**Hospital Ward Name 121**] 7. He had multiple CT scans during the
remainder of the hospitalization, results aforementioned. On
[**2101-1-26**] he was transferred to the TICU for hypotension and
decreased hemocrit. After stabilization of hemocrit (received 6
units pRBCs) and blood pressure stabilization, he was
transferred to [**Hospital Ward Name 121**] 7 on [**2101-1-28**]. Once on the floor, tPA was
placed through the chest tubes. He became hypertensive (SBP
180s) intermittently, and was administered hydralazine IV prn in
addition to atenolol and lisinopril (home medications). On
[**2101-2-7**], all three chest tubes were placed to waterseal. The
anterior CT was subsequently converted to an empyema tube. Prior
to discharge, the posterior and basilar tubes were converted to
empyema tubes. CXR on [**2101-2-11**] revealed no relevant changes in the
right hemithorax.
.
FEN/GI: Following admit, the patient tolerated a regular diet.
He was given Ensure supplements and calorie counts were
initiated per nutritional recommendations. Over 3 days, calorie
were 1403 and protein 47 grams. Lasix 40mg daily was continued
for diuresis and electrolytes were repleted as appropriate. On
discharge, he was tolerating a regular diet; denied nausea or
vomiting.
.
ID: On admit, patient had temperature of 101.2, WBC=8.5. He was
initially placed on
