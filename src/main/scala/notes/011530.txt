Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1145**]
Chief Complaint:
Right upper extremity swelling, shortness of breath.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Hemodialysis
CVL

History of Present Illness:
In brief, the patient is a 74 y.o. HD-dependent Male w/ multiple
medical problems including ESRD [**2-12**] FSGS (focal segmental
glomerular sclerosis), s/p DDRT (deceased donor renal
transplant) in [**2121**], failed graft function [**2-12**] chronic rejection
on Mycophenylate (MMF), CAD s/p CABG, HTN, HL, s/p recent RUE AV
graft on [**10-18**].
.
Four days after placement of the AV graft he was admitted to the
transplant surgery team w/ edema, parasthesias, and SOB. Pt went
to dialysis 3 days post-procedure and was diuresed "close to dry
weight", then had sudden onset SOB on the following day after
exertion. In the ED, there was concern for fluid overload; also
CTA was performed to rule out a PE. In addition, there was
concern for infection versus dvt in the right arm [**2-12**] forearm
swelling and tenderness but this was was ruled out with U/S.
.
On [**10-22**], he continued to have SOB on exam and developed new
oxygen requirement. Chest CT and chest xray were concerning for
evolving pulmonary edema. He was dialyzed 2.3L on [**10-22**] and 1L
on [**10-23**] during hemodialysis for concern CHF exacerbation- got a
dose of Vanc at HD empirically. On [**10-23**], he developed ST
segment depressions in the V3-V5 with elevated enzymes (trop T
0.45, CKMB 7) without any chest pain. Echocardiogram showed no
new wall motion abnormalities and stable ejection fraction 40%.
Cardiology was consulted and suggested that the patient had had
ACS event on day prior to admission when he had developed acute
SOB vs enzyme bump in the setting of CHF. Patient was thought to
be euvolemic by cardiology consult at that time. Enzymes
continued to rise (0.08->0.45->0.55->0.70.) Heparin gtt was
started. Patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 1516**] [**10-24**]. HD on [**10-24**] with
removal 1L.
.
Pt was not urgently sent to cath despite elevated enzymes and
EKG changes, as renal had goal to salvage remaining kidney and
did not want to subject patient to dye load. Patient went for
pMIBI [**10-25**] to look for reversible defect; early in stress test,
patient developed deep ST depressions and was sent emergently to
cath.
.
On cath, SVG to RCA was found to be occluded and SVG to D1 was
successfully stented with DES. Also noted was severe L
subclavian stenosis, patent LIMA. Plan was for ASA 325 mg daily
indefinitely and Plavix 75 mg daily for one year.
.
At the end of the procedure, the patient developed respiratory
difficulty with sats in the mid 80s. He received narcan, at
which point he became more alert but the team noticed that he
was not moving his L side. The patient was transported
immediately to the CCU, where he was evaluted by Neurology. He
was initially sat-ing 97% on RA but was gasping and using all
accessory muscles. He proceeded to desat to 70s; ABG on 100%
non-rebreather was pH 7.35/pO2 47/pCO2 49/HCO3 28. He was
transported to CT scan which showed perfusioin abnormality of
right MCA M1 segment.

Peritent Imaging:
[**10-25**] Head CT
1. Head CT demonstrates loss of [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter
differentiation and right MCA distribution suggestive of an
early infarct.
2. CT perfusion demonstrates large area of middle cerebral
artery territorial ischemia with a small evolving infarct.
3. CT angiography of the head demonstrates occlusion of the
right M1 segment secondary to a clot. Diminished numbers of
distal vascular structures are seen in the sylvian region.
4. CT angiography of the head demonstrates moderate left carotid
stenosis
with exuberant calcification and nonvisualization of the origin
of the left vertebral artery with diffuse atherosclerotic
disease in the aortic arch and proximal vessels as described
above.
5. The images through the lung demonstrate dependent atelectatic
changes and pleural effusion and signs indicative of cardiac
decompensation.

[**2126-10-25**] Cath
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Two vessel coronary artery disease of the RCA and LAD.
2. Patent LIMA-LAD.
3. Occluded SVG-RCA.
4. Proximal 80% stenosis of SVG-D1, occluded D1-OM.
5. 70% left subclavian stenosis.

IMPRESSION: Diminutive but patent portal vein. Please note that
this exam is limited due to patient's clinical status and the
proximal portion of the portal vein was not imaged.

Brief Hospital Course:
74 y.o. HD-dependent Male w/ MMP including ESRD [**2-12**] FSGS, s/p
DDRT in [**2121**], failed graft function [**2-12**] chronic rejection on
MMF, CAD s/p CABG for 3VD, HTN, HL, initially hospitalized for
concern of infection in recent RUE AV graft who was then worked
up for CHF decompensation.

In the interim he developed a NSTEMI and had markedly positive
adenosine MIBI study. Cardiac catheterization noted ulcerated
lesion of SVG to D1. This was stented successfuly but his
catheterization complicated by acute stroke.  He was emergently
taken to interventionial neuroradiology.  The filling defect in
the RMCA territory could not be removed, and he subsequently had
L sided paralysis.  He was admitted to the CCU where his
hospital course was complicated by a LGIB, lactic acidosis, a
profound transaminitis, and persistent fevers without culture
evidence of infection.  Serial head CT's did not show any
