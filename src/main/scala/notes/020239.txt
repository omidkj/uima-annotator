HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 75 year-old man with a
past medical history of cerebrovascular accident with
residual right hemiparesis in [**2157**] as well as diabetes type
2, coronary artery disease, status post catheterization in
[**2170**] with three vessel disease as well as cataracts,
hyperlipidemia and bipolar disorder who is admitted to [**Hospital1 1444**] on [**2172-3-10**] after he was found
down in his home.  He was diagnosed with a left basal ganglia
intracranial hemorrhage likely arising from the caudate with
large intraventricular extension on the left.  He had
subsequent hydrocephalus as well as an acute myocardial
infarction with troponins going greater then 50 as well as
rhabdomyolysis with a CK in the 10,000s.  He was admitted to
the Neurological Intensive Care Unit for closer blood
pressure and neurologic monitoring.  It was felt early on as
his decreased level of consciousness was profound he would
need neurosurgical intervention with a right ventricular
catheter.  This was placed on [**3-11**] the day after
admission.  After insertion the catheter continued to have
200 to 300 cc output a day of blood tinged fluid and his
mental status seemed to improve.  On admission he had low
grade fevers 100 to 101 range with an increased white blood
cell count of 90.5.  Initial workup showed pneumonia with
right upper lobe infiltrate and also a question of left lower
lobe infiltrate.  He was given Ancef initially for his drain
on the first day, however, it was then changed to Levaquin as
well as Flagyl in light of his cultures came back.  He
required intubation on [**3-14**].  He was later started on
Vancomycin with cultures coming back as heavy growth MRSA.

He was followed closely in the Neurosurgical Intensive Care
Unit, the Neurology, Neurosurgery and the [**Hospital **] medical team.
He continued to recover from his myocardial infarction and
his enzymes trended down.  His neurological deficits remained
significantly unchanged.  He was in the Intensive Care Unit
with cerebral spinal fluid samples taken on [**3-16**] and
[**3-20**], which were all no growth and the patient continued to
have fevers even on broad spectrum antibiotics with a white
blood cell count of 12 to 16.  He was briefly extubated, but
then needed to be reintubated the same night.  His sputum
continued to grow large amounts of MRSA on repeat cultures.
His blood and urine culture were negative as well as cerebral
spinal fluid.  Vancomycin was held briefly from [**3-23**] to [**3-24**],
however, the patient's temperature again increased to 102 and
repeat cerebral spinal fluid from ventricular drain at this
point showed 3+ polys, 3+ gram positive cocci in pairs and
clusters within the fluid with 4000 white blood cells and [**Pager number **]
polys and a glucose of 1.  Ceftazidime was added.  Infectious
disease was consulted at that time.  His neurological
examination continued to wax and wane.  His vent drain was
raised and lowered depending on his arousal.  He was noted to
have also right eye deviation and right twitching of his
mouth on two separate occasions, which is suspicious for
seizure.  We ordered an electroencephalogram which was
abnormal due to low voltage slow background with bursts of
polymorphic data and delta frequency slowing.  This indicated
a wide spread cortical dysfunction as well as dysfunction of
the deep midline structures as can be seen with severe
encephalopathy.  There were no focal epileptiform seizures
seen.  At that point we decided to watch him.

Later on in his course he had another episode where his eyes
were strongly deviated to the right and we could not doll him
pass the midline.  At that point it was felt by the neuro
team that we should treat him for seizures.  We loaded him on
phenytoin and gave him Ativan with good relief of his
seizures.  There was no need at that time to repeat an
electroencephalogram as his clinical suspicion was high
enough for epileptiform events.  We decided to continue with
our management and watch his blood pressure, heart rate and
temperature.  He continued to spike.  We involved infectious
disease who felt that this was fever meningismus and he was
not following commands.  There was concern for meningitis and
this should be treated with Vancomycin.  We continued that
per their recommendations as well and continued Rifampin per
their recommendations also.  He continued to not improve
clinically and his neurological examination was somewhat
limited.  He could follow simple commands intermittently, but
could not move his right side to command.  He could
occasionally squeeze hand, but not consistently.  He could
not also consistently follow commands, but he would open his
eyes to voice.  He was intubated and sedated.  His
respiratory coarse breath sounds bilaterally, decreased
breath sounds.  His cardiac examination was regular rate and
rhythm.

We continued to watch him and watch his laboratories,
however, he was unable to improve much.  Pulmonary critical
care team felt he would benefit from a tracheostomy and this
was planned until other issues medically kept him from this
procedure.  It was felt he was on a downhill course and
meningitis, which was being treated intrathecal Vancomycin by
the neurosurgical service and that his hope for a meaningful
recovery was somewhat less then originally due to many
additional medical issues that worsened during his hospital
admission.  It was felt by the team and by his responsible
family that he would be best made CMO.  He was then made CMO
and kept in the Intensive Care Unit for two days before being
transferred to the floor.  He was given morphine for comfort
as well as Ativan for respiratory distress.  On [**4-2**], he
was found to be pulseless and not breathing and on
examination he was pronounced expired at 7:00 p.m. on [**4-2**].
His nephew [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) **] was called at his home and
arrangements were to be made by him to the funeral home.
