Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 4610**] was admitted to the hospital and taken to the
Operating Room where she underwent an gastric bypass. She
tolerated the procedure well and returned to the PACU in stable
condition. Her hemodynamics remained stable and her pain was
controlled with a Dilaudid PCA.
Her post op stay was complicated by an episode of O2
desaturation to mid 80s on 5 L oxygen.She was moved to the ICU
and  put on [**Hospital1 **] PAP. She had good recovery and was transferred
back to the floor with O2 sat of 98% on RA.
Following transfer to the Surgical floor she continued to make
good progress.  She had an upper GI done which showed no
anastomotic leak and she subsequently began a stage 1 diet. Her
pain medication was changed to Roxicet and was very effective.
Over the following 24 hours her diet was gradually advanced to
stage 3 and she tolerated it well without any fullness or
nausea.
She used her incentive spirometer during the day.She was briefly
put on a CPAP for 2 nights.On [**2109-6-20**] she was put on continous
O2 monitoring and she slept for 5 hours without a CPAP.  There
were no episodes of O2 destuartion over the night. On the day of
her discharge she was up and walking independently and her
oxygen was gradually weaned off.

Her abdominal wound was healing and her JP drain was removed
prior to discharge.

After an uneventful post op course she was discharged to home
and will follow up with Dr.[**Last Name (STitle) **].
