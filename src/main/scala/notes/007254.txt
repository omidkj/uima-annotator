contrast or thrombus in the LA/LAA or the RA/RAA.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Mildly dilated RA. No
spontaneous echo contrast in the body of the RA. A catheter or
pacing wire is seen in the RA and extending into the RV. Dynamic
interatrial septum. No ASD by 2D or color Doppler.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify I was present in compliance with HCFA
regulations. The patient was under general anesthesia throughout
the procedure. The patient received antibiotic prophylaxis. The
TEE probe was passed with assistance from the anesthesioology
staff using a laryngoscope. No TEE related complications.

REGIONAL LEFT VENTRICULAR WALL MOTION:





     N = Normal, H = Hypokinetic, A = Akinetic, D = Dyskinetic
Conclusions
PRE-CPB:1. The left atrium is moderately dilated. No spontaneous
echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left
atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of the right
atrium/right atrial appendage. No spontaneous echo contrast is
seen in the body of the right atrium.
2. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
3. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal.
4. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal.
5. There are simple atheroma in the aortic root. There are
simple atheroma in the ascending aorta. There are simple
atheroma in the aortic arch. There are simple atheroma in the
descending thoracic aorta.
6. There are three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no aortic valve
stenosis. Mild to moderate ([**12-24**]+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
7. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial
mitral regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
8. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
Drs. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and [**Name5 (PTitle) **] were notified in person of the
results.

POST-CPB: On infusion of phenylephrine. AV pacing.
Well-preserved LV systolic function with improvement of the
anteroapical and anteroseptal walls. LVEF is now 45%. 1+ AI,
trace MR. Aortic contour is normal post decannulation.
  I certify that I was present for this procedure in compliance
with HCFA regulations.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was transferred her from [**Hospital **] Hospital for
surgery following his catheterization. He remained stable and on
[**11-17**] was taken to the operating room where triple bypass
grafting was performed as noted. Please see operative note for
complete details. He weaned from bypass on neosynephrine and
Propofol.  Epinephrine was begun after surgery for low card
