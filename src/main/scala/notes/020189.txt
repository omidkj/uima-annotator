History of Present Illness:
PCP: [**Name Initial (NameIs) **]
.
[**Age over 90 **] y/o male with MMP including CAD, atrial fibrillation on
Coumadin, T2DM, and CHF EF 35% who presented to the ED with 2
loose bloody stools and poor appetite. Of note, he recently
started taking meloxicam (Mobic) 1 week prior to presentation
for OA. Pt is a poor historian so most of history obtained
through records. He is a resident of the [**Hospital3 **] and lives
there with his wife. [**Name (NI) **] normally wears a diaper as he is
incontinent of urine and staff noticed melena x 2. He was sent
to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED for further evaluation. He was seen recently by
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 73399**], cardiology, at [**Hospital1 18**]. He recently moved to the area
from [**Location (un) **] so he has very few records at [**Hospital1 18**]. He had a
recent ED visit ([**2100-8-15**]) s/p mechanical fall in the bathtub and
was sent home with normal imaging.
.
Vitals upon presentation to the ED: T 98.2 HR 96 BP 144/48 RR 18
98%RA.
.
ED course: He was to be guaiac positive with maroon stool in
vault on exam. NG lavage was performed which revealed maroon
stomach contents and small amount of coffee grounds which
cleared after 150 mL of NS. 2 large bore PIV were placed. He was
T&S for 3 units. He was given Protonix 40 mg IV x 1. He was
found to be hyperkalemic, K of 6, and was given 1 amp of D50, 10
units regular insulin, kayexelate 30 mg PO x 1, and 1 amp of
bicarb. Repeat K was 5.5 and repeat HCT was 28.4. EKG did not
reveal any peaked T waves. He was given Vit K 5 mg SC for an INR
of 6. CXR did not reveal any acute abnormalities. He was given
IVF.
.
ROS: Denies F/C. Denies N/V/D or abdominal pain. No CP or SOB.
He denies PND, orthopnea, or worsening LE edema. He has had a
rash recently that he states is not pruritic. No hematochezia or
hematemesis.

Pertinent Results:
TTE [**2097**]
Mildly increased LV size with normal wall thickness and an
ejection fraction of 35%. There was a moderately
enlarged left atrium. There was evidence of mild-to-moderate
mitral regurgitation, severe tricuspid regurgitation and a
moderately dilated ascending aorta measuring 4.1 cm.
.
[**2100-7-21**]: Pacemaker interrogation was performed of the patient's
St. [**Male First Name (un) 923**]
Identity SR model 5172 single chamber pacemaker (serial
#[**Serial Number 73401**]).
His ventricular lead is a St. [**Male First Name (un) 923**] model 1346T with serial
number
[**Serial Number 73402**]. The device

was implanted on [**2096-12-6**]. Underlying rhythm is atrial
fibrillation with a well-controlled ventricular response rate.
He is paced 48% of the time. Heart rate histogram is normal.
The ventricular lead has an impedance of 390 ohms, a sensed
R-wave of 3.5 millivolts and a threshold of 1.25 volts at 0.4
milliseconds. Minor programming changes today were made to the
device. He remains programmed VVIR at 60 beats per minute.
.
CXR [**2100-8-19**]
No acute cardiopulmonary process. Moderate cardiomegaly.
Calcified granuloma of the left upper lobe.
.
EKG on admission: Atrial fibrillation, RBBB, no peaked T waves,
no acute ST changes, demand paced.

Brief Hospital Course:
[**Age over 90 **] y/o male with MMP including CAD, atrial fibrillation on
Coumadin, T2DM, and CHF EF 35% who presented to the ED with 2
loose bloody stools and poor appetite. He was intially admitted
to the MICU for closer monitoring given UGIB.
.
# UGIB
The patient was admitted after two episodes of melena. He had
further episodes of melena in the MICU in the setting of
receiving Kayexelate for hyperkalemia. An NG lavage in the ED
was positive for coffee grounds. His INR was also
supratherapeutic. GI was consulted given need for EGD. He was
managed initially on a Protonix gtt until the pt's INR
decreased. An EGD was performed on [**2100-8-20**] which revealed
hypertrophic gastric mucosa, likely source of his bleeding. He
later had a colonoscopy on [**2100-8-24**]; findings included grade I
internal hemorrhoids and sigmoid diverticulosis with no areas of
active bleeing. He was transitioned to a PPI PO BID. His HCT was
monitored and remained stable after his MICU course. The
etiology for his UGIB was most likely the above EGD findings in
the setting of new NSAID use and supratherapeutic INR.
.
# Atrial fibrillation
His BP meds (beta blocker, lisinopril and digoxin) were
initially held in the setting of a UGIB. He was then started on
low dose BB with gradual titration up for HR control and his
digoxin was also restarted. His metoprolol remains at 50 mg
daily, decreased from his previous dose of 100 mg daily.  This
can be increased as needed for BP and HR control following
discharge.  Lisinopril was also restarted.  His Coumadin was
initially held [**1-22**] to UGIB; in light of upper extremity DVT,
ongoing Afib, and no active bleeding on EGD/colonoscopy, he will
be restarted on coumadin with Lovenox bridge with goal INR
1.8-2.
.
# Supratherapeutic INR
He was given Vitamin K and his INR gradually decreased to normal
(1.1).  He will be restarted on Coumadin as above.
.
# Hyperkalemia
This was most likely in the setting of aldactone and Mobic.
Resolved with hydration, Kayexalate, improvement in renal
function as above.
.
# T2DM
He was covered with a HISS while NPO and then once eating
restarted his NPH and continued HISS.  His glucoses were mildly
elevated (150-250) here.  He will be discharged on his home dose
of NPH with sliding scale prn; this can be adjusted as needed at
rehab.
.
# CHF EF 35%
His BP meds were initially held on admission [**1-22**] to UGIB and
gradually restarted. There was no evidence of volume overload on
admission; however, he was given IVF while NPO and became volume
overload without any evidence of respiratory compromise. He was
diuresed gently for one day with good response.  He remains on
his home dose of spironolactone and an increased dose of Lasix
(40 once daily).  He is on beta blocker and lisinopril.
Lisinopril is currently at decreased dose (10mg daily vs home
dose of 20mg daily); this can be adjusted as needed.
.
# CRI
Baseline Cr of ~ 1.7 per records; improved during admission to
creatinine 1-1.1.
.
