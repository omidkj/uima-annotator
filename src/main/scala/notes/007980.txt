Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1377**]
Chief Complaint:
nausea,vomitting, generalized weakness

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
2 Central Venous Catheters


History of Present Illness:
78 y/o lady with hypertension and supraventricular tachycardia
presented to the Emergency Department with 3 to 4 days of
nausea, vomitting and generalized weakness. Patient was seen at
[**Hospital1 18**] ED on [**2156-1-14**] with right ureteral stone. She was suppose
to have an elective cardioversion as out patient prior to
surgical removal of this stent. Since getting home, patient has
felt generally weak and decreased appetite. She has had on and
off of abdominal pain and back pain. Her husband has a hard time
quantifying or qualifying the pain.
.
Patient continued to have nausea, nonbloody, nonbilious
vomitting and generalized weakness, and husband decided to bring
the patient to the Emergency Department. On arrival to [**Hospital1 18**] ED
patient was walking and talking without any difficulty. Her
inital vitals in ED were T 96 BP 96/64 HR 96 RR 16 unable to
check oxygen saturation. Her SBP trended down to 40s and she was
started on pressors (initally phenyphrine which was switched to
levophed). Patient also received 7L of IVF. She was started on
dobutamine drip after a bedside TTE showed depressed LV
function. Her oxygen saturation also decreased to 60s and she
was intubated. Patient also received vancomycin, ceftriaxone and
levaquin in ED for possible pneumonia on CXR. CT torso with
contrast shows PE, Aortic/celiac thormbus, and infarcted spleen.
There was also concern for shock bowel. Vascular surgery and
General surgery were consulted. Acute medical management for DIC
was recommended. Hematology was consulted for coagulopathy.
Urology was also consulted for ureteral stone.
.
On arrival to the floor patient was on levophed and dobutamine
drip, sedated and intubated. Most of the history was obtained
from the chart and with husband.
.
ROS: Patient has experienced on and off palpitations. No fevers,
chills, or night sweats.

TTE [**2156-1-27**]:
The left atrium is dilated. The right atrium is dilated. There
is moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
focal hypokinesis of the inferior and inferolateral walls. Right
ventricular chamber size is normal. with borderline normal free
wall function. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate (2+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a small pericardial effusion. The effusion appears
circumferential. There are no echocardiographic signs of
tamponade.
IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Moderate regional left
ventricular systolic dysfunction. Borderline reduced right
ventricular function. Moderate mitral regurgitation. Mild aortic
regurgitation. Mild pulmonary hypertension. Small
circumferential effusion with no echocardiographic signs of
tamponade.

CT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST; CT PELVIS W/CONTRAST; CT CHEST W/CONTRAST
[**2156-1-27**]
CHEST: There is a large but nonobstructing thrombus at the
bifurcation of
the right middle lobe vessels and the right interlobar artery.
Given the
delayed nature of the scan, there is suboptimal opacification of
the pulmonary arterial tree and the more distal segmental and
subsegmental branches are difficult to fully evaluate. There are
no associated findings suggestive of right heart strain. The
heart itself is enlarged with predominantly left atrial
enlargement. Scattered coronary calcifications are evident.
The ascending aorta is approximately 36 mm in diameter 1 cm
distal to the
sinotubular ridge. At the level of the main pulmonary artery,
the descending thoracic aorta is approximately 25 mm in
diameter. At the aortic hiatus, the thoracic aorta is
approximately 23 mm in diameter. Further comment on the aorta is
reserved to the following section on the abdomen/pelvis.
There are large bilateral pleural effusions. Extensive dependent

consolidations are noted likely due to relaxation atelectasis
although
aspiration or small foci of infection cannot be entirely
excluded. There is interlobular septal lines likely due to
edema. An endotracheal tube is
present with the distal tip at the ostium of the right mainstem
bronchus. A nasogastric tube is also present. There is a
leftward deviation of the
trachea at the thoracic inlet of indeterminate cause due to
incomplete
scanning of the thyroid and neck region. Enlarged lymph nodes
are noted
throughout the mediastinum.

ABDOMEN/PELVIS: There is a large mural thrombus occupying over
50% of the
lumen of the descending thoracic aorta starting at approximately
the level of the left superior pulmonary vein. This long mural
thrombus extends to the aortic hiatus. Intimal calcifications
are noted posteriorly without
displacement. Near the aortic hiatus, a second focus of mural
thrombus along the anterior aspect of the aorta is seen
extending into the abdomen and terminating at the level of the
superior mesenteric artery. This thrombus occludes the ostium of
the celiac axis which is completely thrombosed. The appearance
of this extensive mural thrombus is interval given its lack of
appearance on the chest CT dated [**2156-1-14**]. There are
corresponding large infarctions involving the spleen. There is a
heterogeneous attenuation at predominantly the left hepatic lobe
which is presumably due to the vascular compromise. As best can
be determined it somewhat normalizes on the later chest CT.
There is appropriate contrast opacification of the superior
mesenteric artery. Collateralization is identified through the
gastroduodenal and pancreaticoduodenal arcades.

There is periportal edema noted in the liver. A well-defined
low-attenuation lesion is identified within segment V anteriorly
measuring approximately 8 mm in diameter. This is indeterminate
but likely represents a simple cyst. There is marked gallbladder
wall edema. A significant amount of mesenteric edema and ascites
is present. Majority of the ascites is in the perihepatic
distribution as well as deep within the pelvis. The kidneys
enhance and e
