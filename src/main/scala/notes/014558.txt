History of Present Illness:
Mr [**Known lastname 93756**] is a pt well known to the Thoracic surgery service, he
is a 66 year-old male previously followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] at the
[**Hospital1 756**] 14 years ago. He has a history of esophageal carcinoma
status-post radiation with 3-hole esohagectomy in [**2104**] at [**Hospital1 112**].
He was recently hospitalized at [**Hospital1 18**] for PNA and found to have
stricture near the cricopharyngeus, with evidence of
tracheoesophageal fistulation. An EGD showed no cancer
recurrence however. A J-tube was placed in [**2119-4-19**], but since
that time has had issues with dehydration and instances of
clogged J-tube, thus he has been on supplemental TPN.

Most recently he was hospitalized on [**2119-8-2**] and underwent
repair of tracheoesophageal fistula; tracheal resection and
reconstruction; flexible bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar
lavage and esophagogastroduodenoscopy with central compartment
neck dissection, left hemithyroidectomy and left recurrent nerve
sacrifice; with repair of tracheoesophageal fistula with
interposition flap and pectoralis major myofascial flap on the
right side, with a split-thickness skin graft 1 inch x 10 cm to
right neck. That hospital course was complicateds by hypercarbic
respiratory failure, reintubation, and placement of a trach. He
was dischrged to a rehab where he was doing well until recently.

Two days ago the nursing staff at the rehab noticed marked
azothemia and sent off a blood culture. The blood culture came
back positive for G-R's. Also sent off were a urine cx, which
came back as negative, and a CXR, which showed stable chronic
infiltrates. Today the staff noticed some leaking from his
J-tube
and concurrent hypotension to 80-90's/50-60's and started vanc
and zosyn IV, had his PICC line d/c'ed, and then was transfered
him by ambulance to [**Hospital1 18**] for further work up. Throughout this
the patient has only complained of mild abdominal discomfort
near his J-tube site and denies any fever, chills, cough,
wheezing, SOB, dysuria, hematuria.

[**2119-9-25**]: CXR
Moderate pneumothorax on the left has decreased without a
significant residual. Please note there is a skin fold with [**Last Name (un) **]
effect projecting over the left peripheral lung. There is a
pigtail catheter in situ in the left basilar pleural space. The
tracheostomy tube is in standard location, terminating 3.9 cm
above the carina. There is a right PICC terminating in the mid
SVC, unchanged.
There are bibasilar consolidations, right great than left, with
a
moderate-sized right pleural effusion. There is no pulmonary
edema.
Cardiomediastinal silhouette is largely obscured by the
bibasilar opacities.
IMPRESSION: 1. Interval reduction in the previously
moderate-to-large left
pneumothorax without significant residual.
2. Bibasilar consolidations and moderate-sized right pleural
effusions are
unchanged.

Abdominal CT [**2119-9-20**]:
1. No evidence of small-bowel obstruction.
2. Jejunostomy and cholecystostomy tubes in place. Small
subcapsular
hematoma related to the cholecystostomy tube.
3. Large left and small right pleural effusions with significant
bilateral
atelectasis.
4. Moderate-to-large pericardial effusion which has increased in
size since the prior exam.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 93756**] was transferred from [**Hospital 671**] Rehab Hospital for
bacteremia.  Upon arrival the ED a chest CT was done which
showed a marked distended gallbladder.  A follow-up gallbladder
scan on [**2119-9-15**] showed Non-visualization of the gallbladder
consistent with cystic duct obstruction.  He than underwent
percutaneous cholecystostomy tube 100 cc of bile drained, placed
to a drainage bag and removed on [**2119-9-27**]. He also had J-tube
percutaneous J-tube exchange to a 12 French.

Respiratory: Tracheostomy tube patient self-removed [**2119-9-17**]
requiring replacement. Continual suction for copious thick
secretions. Left pleural effusion drained for 900 mL of serous
fluid by interventional pulmonology on [**2119-9-18**]. On [**2119-9-22**] he
developed acute respiratory distress and was found to have a
recurrent left transudative effusion, for which a pigtail was
placed and drained 770/625 then taper off to 170 over 24 hrs.
The pigtail was accidentally pulled out by patient [**2119-9-26**].
He was followed by serial chest films which showed small left
pleural effusion which was stable over several days. left
pneumothorax stable.

Cardiac: Sinus rhythm, hemodynamically stable

GI: The patient had nausea and vomiting, which was investigated
with KUB on [**2119-9-19**] but no obstruction was seen. Tube feedings
were held and changed to half strength and uptitrated to goal As
the patient became hyponatremic we changed the tube feedings to
full strength which the patient tolerated without problems.

Nutrition: Seen by nutrition.  Tube feeds Isosource 1.5 Goal 50
mL/hr.
