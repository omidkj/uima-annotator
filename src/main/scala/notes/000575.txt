History of Present Illness:
89-year-old gentleman who has a past medical history
of known CAD s/p CABG (LIMA-LAD; SVG-OM1; SVG-PDA) in [**2149**],
multiple prior PCI's, recent NSTEMI in [**9-16**] thought to be [**2-8**]
demand, on plavix and ASA, Afib no longer on coumadin,
hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diet controlled diabetes, who
presents s/p unwitnessed fall. He was admitted to the MICU 1 day
ago. Patient does not recall fall or whether there was LOC. He
feel in his home from a standing position and hit his head. He
was noted to have a scalp laceration that was bleeding badly on
arrival to ED. He was estimated to have lost approx 1 unit of
blood and so was given one in the ED. The scalp lesion was
stapled by trauma [**Doctor First Name **]. He was hypotensive to SBP 50s in the ED.
In total he has received 2 PRBCS and 3L IVF over the past 24
hours. His BP stabilizied and so a lower dose of his lasix was
started this morning. CT head was negative.
In addition, he was hypoxic in the ED, requiring at NRB for a
short period of time. CT torson found a right sided non-diplaced
rib fracture and a fairly large left sided pleural effusion
which increased over the past 24 hours. A thoracentesis was
performed and removed 1500 cc of blood fluid. It was felt that
the effusion was secondary to rib fractures.

He reported that he had been feeling unwell all week. He was
found to have a UTI; cutlure is postive for GNRs. He was
initally given broad spectrum antibiotics but narrowed to
ceftriaxone for UTI. He currently feels well. He denies pain,
SOB, lightheadedness or dizziness.

EKG- [**2157-10-15**]
Ectopic atrial rhythm and increase in rate compared to the
previous tracing of [**2157-10-3**]. Left ventricular hypertrophy with
ST-T wave change.
Intraventricular conduction delay. There is scooping of the ST
segments
consistent with use of digitalis. Clinical correlation is
suggested.

IMAGING
.
CXR [**2157-10-15**]
CHEST, AP SEMI-UPRIGHT: Again seen is a moderate right pleural
effusion, with partial redistribution along the lateral right
hemithorax and lung apex, likely due to positioning. Chronic
loculated effusion and pleural thickening along the left lateral
hemithorax and lung base are unchanged. There is continued
moderate vascular congestion and interstitial edema. Moderate
cardiomegaly is present, with median sternotomy wires,
mediastinal clips, and coronary bypass grafts. There is no
pneumothorax. Evaluation of the right middle and lower lobes is
limited by superimposed effusion. Mild retrocardiac atelectasis
persists. Diffuse skeletal demineralization persists, with
S-shaped thoracolumbar scoliosis and severe degenerative
changes. Vascular calcification are seen in the upper left
abdomen. Multiple punctate calcifications in the left upper
quadrant of the abdomen are compatible with splenic granulomas
as seen on prior CT.

CXR [**2157-10-17**]
COMPARISON: [**2157-10-16**].
.
FINDINGS: Moderate right and small partially loculated left
pleural effusions appear unchanged. No visible pneumothorax.
Acute right rib fracture is again demonstrated. No new or
progressive abnormalities.
.
IMPRESSION:
1. Stable moderate right effusion with compressive atelectsis.
2. Continued cardiomegaly and interstitial edema.
3. Chronic loculated left effusion and pleural thickening.
.

CT HEAD- [**2157-10-15**]
FINDINGS: There is no evidence of acute hemorrhage, large acute
territorial
infarction, or large masses. There is evidence of
periventricular white
matter hypodensities, in keeping with chronic vessel ischemic
changes.
Hypodensity along the subcortical white matter in the right
frontal lobe,
appears unchanged, 2B:26. Ventricles and sulci are prominent,
stable. There
is no hydrocephalus. There is no shift of midline structures.
Moderate
calcification in the carotid arter
