Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2485**]
Chief Complaint:
hypoxia, cough

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:

History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 50 yo paraplegic female (T2 injury following
MVC [**1-5**]) who has a history of recurrent UTIs and pneumonias
who presents with a productive cough and hypoxia x a few hours.
The patient is currently intubated and sedated so the husband
provides the history.  He states that over the past 14 days she
has been treated for a UTI by her PCP with keflex and macrobid.
The day prior to her admission [**2147-10-7**] her abx course had
finished and in the a.m. of [**10-8**] she had a productive cough,
productive of brown sputum.  Her husband stated that her face
would turn red while coughing and he checked her O2 sat and it
was 82%.  He started her on 5L of nasal cannula oxygen and
brought her to the ER.  She was stable for the 45 minute car
ride in without coughing.  She did not complain of any other
symptoms to her husband.  [**Name (NI) **] symptoms of UTI are usually of
color change of her urine, a change in the odor of her urine and
sometimes delerium, none of which she had during this episode.
She had no fevers or chills that the husband is aware of.

In the ER she was 83% on 5L.   She improved to 96% on a non
rebreather.  She has 2 PIV 20g in hand and a R IJ in place.  She
has had a persistent low BP of 80s and she was started on
levophed and her BPs improved.  She had rec'd 4 L of IVF in the
ER.  Her Tmax was 101.8 rectally.

She rec'd vanc, zosyn, and tylenol in the ER for likely
pneumonia.

Pertinent Results:
Imaging:
CXR ([**10-8**]): FINDINGS: The right IJ line has been slightly
retracted and is now at the SVC just above the right atrium.
Again seen is moderate right pleural effusion.  There is
bilateral alveolar infiltrates, left greater than right. This
appears to have progressed slightly; however, there is improved
aeration at the left base.

CXR ([**10-24**]): FINDINGS: The tracheostomy and right IJ line both
appear unchanged from previous study. An endogastric tube
courses inferiorly below the GE junction The tip of an IVC
filter is seen at the edge of the field of view. There has been
interval placement of a left PICC whose tip rests in the lower
SVC. The heart size is at the large end of normal but unchanged
from previous study. The mediastinal contours are also
unchanged. Overall the lungs are clear with no focal or lobar
consolidation. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.

Brief Hospital Course:
# Hypoxia and respiratory failure: Patient presented with
respiratory distress, and was found to have recurrent RLL
pneumonia. Sputum culture grew out klebsiella.  Patient was
intubated on arrival to the ICU floor as respiratory status
worsened and arterial gas concerning. Patient was put on
levofloxacin and her pneumonia and respiratory status improved.
She was extubated on [**10-15**], and was doing well despite copious
amount of secretions. However, 2 hours after the extubation,
patient complained of acute pleuritic RUQ. Stat CXR showed
worsening right pleural effusion, and RLL and RML collapse. The
team discussed the necessity of re-intubation given new right
lung collapse/plugging and inability to cough, and plan of
tracheostomy in a couple of days, pt refused. Her oxygen
saturation remained good for the rest of the night. Repeat CXR
the next morning showed worsened right lung collapse to the
point of complete right lung collapse, but patient continued to
do well with intermittent CPAP supports despite the completely
collapsed right lung. On [**10-18**], pt requested that she be
re-intubated in the afternoon as she was more dyspneic on
non-rebreather. Anesthesiology came and intubated her. Soon
afterwards, patient
