Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 425**]
Chief Complaint:
left arm soreness and pain

Cardiac catheterization with stenting of left circumflex artery


History of Present Illness:
54 year old male with history of HTN, hyperlipidemia, positive
family history of CAD who has left arm pain/soreness since
evening of [**2198-1-11**].  The pain was associated with diaphoresis,

Cardiac catheterization:
COMMENTS:
1. Selective coronary angiography revealed a right dominant
system with
acute occlusion of the circumflex. The LMCA did not show any
angiographic evidence of coronary artery disease.  The LAD had a
60%
tubular stenosis proximally.  A large diagonal was almost a
"twin" LAD
system. It too had a tubular stenosis proximally - 40%.  There
was a
large normal ramus branch.  The LCx gave off one small OM1
branch before
it was completely occluded in its midsegment.  This was stented,
after
which it was clear that the OM2 was a large vessel that supplied
most of
the posterior LV wall.  The RCA was dominant and had a 60%
stenosis
distally just after the take-off of a small PDA.
2. Limited hemodynamics revealed severely elevated filling
pressures and
low cardiac output.
3. Left ventriculography revealed anterobasal and anterolateral
hypokinesis and an ejection fraction of 30%.  There was no
mitral
regurgitation.
4. Successful placement of two overlapping bare metal stents in
the LCx,
a 3.0 x 30 mm Driver distally and a 3.5 x 15 mm Driver
proximally. Final
angiography demonstrated a 10% residual stenosis before the
stents, no
residual stenosis within the stents, no angiographically
apparent
dissection, and normal flow (See PTCA Comments).
5.  Because of concerns about a prior history of anaphylactic
reaction
to intravenous dye, the patient was pre-medicated with steroids,

benadryl and pepcid. A small test dose of 5ml of dye was given
and the
blood pressure closely watched for 5 minutes. There was no fall
in BP
neither did the patient experience any symptoms.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Two vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Severe systolic and diastolic ventricular dysfunction.
3. Acute inferior myocardial infarction, managed by acute ptca.
 PTCA of  vessel.
4. No evidence of anaphylaxis to intravenous dye.
.
ECHO: LVEF 40%
1. The left atrium is mildly dilated.
2. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The
left ventricular
cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is mildly
depressed. Inferior akinesis and posterolateral and lateral
hypokinesis are
present.


Brief Hospital Course:
1.  CAD - This 54 year old male with left arm pain, found to
have an STEMI, now s/p intervention on left Cx was admitted to
CCU for further observation.  In the CCU he was continued on
integrillin for 18 hours.  He was given lasix to gently diurese
him given his elevated pressures during the catheterization.  He
did well post catheterization and was started on Aspirin,
Plavix, beta-blocker, ACE-I, and Lipitor.  His lipids were
checked and his cholesterol was 208, LDL 82, HDL 58.  He was
transfered out of the CCU to the hospital floor for further
management.  He tolerated all of his medications.  An
echocardiogram on Monday, [**1-15**] showed a LVEF of 40%
with inferior and posteriolateral akinesis.  He will need to
follow up in [**3-30**] weeks for further assessment of his residual
stenosis.  He will need a stress test and echo at this time.
2. Increased LFTs - He was found to have elevated LFTs on
admission.  These are most likely cardiac in origin and were
trending down to normal at the time of discharge.  He will need
to have these re-checked by his primary care doctor in the
future to ensure there is no further abnormality.
3. Increased WBC - He was also found to have an increased WBC on
admission.  He remained afebrile for the course of admission.
His chest x-ray showed no sign of infection.  His blood and
urine cultures were negative.  On the final day of admission his
WBC count had dropped to 10.
