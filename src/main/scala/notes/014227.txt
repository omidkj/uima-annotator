Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: [**Age over 90 **] year old woman with history of CAD, status post MI,
tachy-brady, status post pacemaker, CHF, diabetes type II, and
depression who sustained a left hip fracture after a fall at
rehab.

1. Left hip fracture: Upon medical clearance (unchanged EKG,
negative CXR, negative UA, normal PT/PTT, and correction of mild
hyponatremia and hyperkalemia), she underwent ORIF of her left
hip.  She was started on a 7 day course of prophylactic
antibiotics cefazolin and levofloxacin.  She was started on a 6
week course of enoxaparin 40 mg SC for DVT prophylaxis
post-operatively.  She should follow-up with orthopedics in 2
weeks upon discharge.

2. Hypotension: She had post-operative hypotension that was
attributed to hypovolemia given her peri-operative blood loss
resulting in a 6 point hematocrit drop.  She responded to fluid
bolus.  She remained hypotensive and required pressors.  A
cortisol stimulation test was borderline and she was started on
stress-dose steroids.  She required fluid boluses to maintain
her CVP and pressors to maintain her blood pressor.  On ICU day
3, she weaned off of the pressors.  Her stress dose steroids
were stopped after a 3 day course since her pressures were
stabilized and since she had a borderline cortisol stimulation
test.

3) Pain control: She was started on tramadol and acetaminophen
post-operatively for pain control.  She became somnolent and
unresponsive after 100 mg dose of tramadol.  She became
responsive after a 1 mg dose of naloxone.  Her tramadol dose was
adjusted to 25 mg [**Hospital1 **], which she tolerated well.  Her outpatient
gabapentin was also continued throughout the admission for
control of neuropathy in her feet.

3) Delirium: She had a exacerbation of delirium
post-operatively, which was most likely related to the
peri-operative Morphine and Fentanyl administration.  Her
neurological exam was grossly non-focal and a repeat head CT was
negative for acute event.
*
4) CAD/Afib/AS: Pre-operatively, her aspirin and isosorbide were
held.  Her Atacand was continued throughout the admission.  Her
sotalol was initially continued for rate control.  Her sotalol
was held post-operatively given her hypotension.  He Aspirin was
restarted on post-operative day 1.  Her sotalol was restarted on
ICU day 4 once her blood pressure was stable.  She had a
echocardiogram that showed left and right ventricular
hypertrophy with an EF greater than 55%, moderate aortic
stenosis, 1+ tricuspid regurgitation and 2+ mitral
regurgitation.  She is not on Coumadin for anticoagulation since
she has a risk for fall.
*
5) Anemia: She had a 6 point drop in hematocrit that required 2
units of pRBCs.  Her hematocrit remained stable throughout the
admission otherwise.
*
6) Depression: Her sertraline was continued throughout the
admission.

7) Diabetes: She was on Glyburide at rehab, but it was
discontinued on admission.  She was maintained on an insulin
sliding scale.  This scale needed to be increased once she was
started on the stress-dose steroids.  She was restarted on
Glyburide 2.5 mg QD prior to discharge.

7) FEN: She passed a speech and swallow evaluation and was
recommended to have honey thick liquids and pureed solids.  Her
electrolytes were repleted as needed.  She received numerous
fluid boluses to maintain her CVP during the first few days of
her ICU admission.
*
8) Prophylaxis: Enoxaparin for post-operative DVT prophylaxis.
She was maintained on a PPI and bowel regimen.

9) Access: a right IJ catheter was placed given her hypotension.
*
10) Code: Full. Her power of attorney is her daughter who
recently was in the ICU and unable to make decisions.  Her son
[**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) 16343**] was also involved in her care and consented for
surgery and care during this admission.
