History of Present Illness:
62yo woman with history of cardiomyopathy presented with several
days of worsening shortness of breath and cough. On initial
evaluation in ED, she was found to be in respiratory distress w/
pulse oximetry of 86% and was then intubated. She was found to

80's/50's and she had a R IJ cordis placed and was given volume
resuscitation and levophed. Initial ABG was (pH 7.06/pCO2 92/pO2
103). Initial WBC of 16.7.

Physical Exam:
VITALS: T 100.0, BP 109/52, HR 105, RR 20, Sat 95%3LNC
GENERAL: Well-appearing, no acute distress, able to carry on
conversations in full sentences, no accessory muscle use
HEENT: EOMI, PERRL, MMM
NECK: Bandage over site of Right IJ (unable to appreciate JVD)
CV: RRR, 3/6 systolic murmur throughout precordium
RESP: Fine crackles [**12-26**] way up bilaterally
ABD: Soft, NT, ND, normoactive bowel sounds
EXT: WWP with no clubbing, cyanosis, or edema; 2+ DP pulses
bilaterally
NEURO: A&O x 3

Pertinent Results:
Echo [**2-18**]: IMPRESSION: Hypertrophic, obstructive cardiomyopathy
with at least moderate mitral regurgitation due to valvular [**Male First Name (un) **].
If clinically indicated, a TEE may better assess the degree of
intrinsic aortic valvular disease and to assess mitral valve
anatomy.
.
CTA CHEST [**2-17**]: IMPRESSION: 1. No pulmonary embolus. 2. Findings
consistent with diffuse multifocal pneumonia. There may be an
element of superimposed edema.
.
B/L LE Dopplers [**2-20**]: BILATERAL LOWER EXTREMITY ULTRASOUND: No
prior studies. Bilateral grayscale and Doppler son[**Name (NI) 867**] was
performed of the greater saphenous, common femoral, superficial
femoral, popliteal, and deep veins of the calf. Venous
structures compress normally and demonstrate normal flow,
waveforms, augmentation without intraluminal thrombus. No
abnormal adenopathy. IMPRESSION: No evidence of DVT.
.
TEE [**2115-2-21**]: The left atrial volume is markedly increased. No
spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the left atrial appendage.
No thrombus is seen in the left atrial appendage. The right
atrium is moderately dilated. There is severe symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. Left ventricular systolic function is
hyperdynamic (EF>75%). The ascending, transverse and descending
thoracic aorta are normal in diameter and free of
atherosclerotic plaque. No thoracic aortic dissection is seen.
There are three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets
are mildly thickened and calcified. No masses or vegetations are
seen on the aortic valve. There is no aortic valve stenosis.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. There is partial
posterior mitral leaflet flail with moderate thickening of the
anterior leaflet. No mass or vegetation is seen on
the mitral valve. Torn mitral chordae are present. Severe (4+)
mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery
systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion. Compared with
the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2115-2-18**], the current
study shows severe mitral regurgitation not appreciated
previously likely because of the eccentricity of the regurgitant
jet.
.
Cardiac Cath [**2115-2-22**]: FINAL DIAGNOSIS: 1. No angiographically
apparent flow limiting cornary artery disease. 2. Elevated left
sided filling pressures. 3. Depressed cardiac index. 4. Normal
left ventricular ejection fraction. 5. 4+ mitral regurgitation.
6. HOCM with an inducible gradient of 120mmHg after PVC.

CHEST (PA & LAT) [**3-5**]
CONCLUSION: Marked improvement in the left basilar pleural
effusion as compared to four days ago, with only a tiny residual
effusion in the posterior left costophrenic angle visible today.
Also disappearance of the prior tiny right apical pneumothorax.
Continuing decrease in bilateral linear atelectasis was also
noted.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 13551**] is a 62 year old woman with history of hypertrophic
cardiomyopathy presenting with respiratory failure and
hypotension attributed to pulmonary edema.
She was transferred from the ED to the MICU. In the MICU she was
monitored and started on broad-spectrum antibiotics (cefepime,
vancomycin, and levofloxacin) for presumed pneumonia. Her
respiratory status improved dramatically with mechanical
ventilation and positive pressure, and she was extubated on
[**2-19**]. Initial TTE on [**2-18**] revealed an EF of 65-70% with HOCM and
2+ MR. [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 1834**] a TEE on [**2-21**] which revealed 4+ MR and a
hyperdynamic left ventricle (EF>&75%). She then [**Month/Day (4) 1834**] a
cardiac cath on [**2-22**] which also revealed severe mitral
reguritation without significant coronary disease. Over the next
several days she received medical management until her stauts
improved for surgery. She was taken to the OR on [**2115-2-26**] and
[**Date Range 1834**] a mitral valve replacement. Please see operative
report for surgical details. Following surgery she was
transferred to the CSRU for invasive monitoring in stable
condition. Later on op day she required a bronchoscopy d/t an
airway obstruction and secretions were removed. Later on this
day she was weaned from sedation, awoke neurologically intact
and extubated. On post-op day one she was started on diuretics
and gently diuresed towards her pre-op weight. She was then
transferred to the SDU. On post-op day two she was started on
Coumadin with a Heparin bridge until her INR was therapeutic.
Chest tubes were removed on this day as well. Epicardial pacing
wires were removed on post-op day three. Physical therapy began
working with patient for strength and mobility. Over the
remainder of her hospital course she was without complications
and awaited her INR to increase to a therapeutic level prior to
discharge. Finally on post-op day 9 she was discharged home.
