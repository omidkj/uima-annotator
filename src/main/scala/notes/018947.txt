Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 14964**]
Chief Complaint:
? wound infection, shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
cardiac catheterization
blood transfusion
CABG

History of Present Illness:
48 diabetic male s/p left SFA to DP bypass graft with in-situ
SVG ([**4-9**] Vascular) & s/p L 4th toe debridement ([**4-10**] Podiatry)
Podiatry admitted with cheif concern of right dorsal dehiscence,
wound infection and exposed graft. Night before admission, he
developed shortness of breath as well as nausea. Came to ED for
evaluation of dehiscence but was found to have EKG changes with
new 2-[**Street Address(2) 2051**] depressions in V5-V6. His enzymes were positive
with CK peak 437, MB 13, and Troponin T of 2.3. Assessed to have
NSTEMI- His cath showed 3 VD with 90% lesions of LAD, LCX, RCA,
and occluded OM 2. Cardiac surgery decided to proceed to CABG.
Pt transferred to the floor from the CCU. Two days of low grade
fevers resulted in negative fever workup including CXR, Bl Cx,
UCx, XR feet, US c/w small pinpoint left foot superficial fluid
collection too small to drain.  Cardiac surgery took patient to
the OR on HD

Podiatry now with dehiscence, wound infection and exposed graft
on the left. He then developed shortness of breath as well as
nausea. He was found to have EKG changes with new 2-[**Street Address(2) 2051**]

CXR IMPRESSION:
1) Perihilar haziness and diffuse interstitial opacities, most
likely due to pulmonary edema from fluid overload. Drug reaction
and interstitial infection are considered less likely but should
also be considered in the appropriate clinical setting.
2) Associated small pleural effusions, right greater than left.

Echo [**4-4**]:
The left atrium is markedly dilated. [Intrinsic left ventricular
systolic
function may be more depressed given the severity of valvular
regurgitation.] Overall left ventricular systolic function is
moderately depressed. (Ejection Fraction: 30% to 35%) Resting
regional wall motion abnormalities include anteroseptal and
apical hypokinesis/akinesis and mid to distal inferolateral
hypokinesis/akinesis. Right ventricular chamber size is normal.
The aortic root is moderately dilated. The ascending aorta is
moderately dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion. There is no
aortic valve stenosis. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The mitral regurgitation jet is eccentric. Moderate [2+]
tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

LENI [**5-4**]
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of lower extremity DVT.
2. Tiny fluid collection at the left dorsal foot.

Brief Hospital Course:
1. CAD: Mr. [**Known lastname 35098**] was found to have an NSTEMI on admission- he
had a cardiac catheterization which found that he had 3vd (see
report) and had an RCA stent placed.  He was transferred to CCU
then to [**Hospital Unit Name 196**] service awaiting CABG. He was continued on Plavix,
ASA, [**Last Name (un) **], Spironolactone.
.
2. CHF: Echo [**5-2**] demonstrated TR, severe MR, LVEF 30-35%.
Subsequent CXRs demonstrated worsening CHF which resolved with
diuresis. Continued on spironolactone, [**Last Name (un) **].
.
3. Fever: Patient developed a fever on HD 3, Max 102 [**5-2**]
afternoon then remained with low grade fevers 99-100 HD [**5-15**].
Blood cultures and Urine cultures negative, CXR without
infiltrate, no signs of osteo on XR, Vascular surgery feels
their wound is appropriate and uninfected, ID consulted, US of
left foot demonstrated tiny pinpoint fluid collection too small
to be drained.  CT surgery willing to surgery when afebrile x
24hrs.
.
4. SFA Dehiscence: L dorsal foot superficial dehiscence with
graft exposure. Vasc surgery followed in house. Wet-dry dsg
changes daily
.
5. DM: He was followed by [**Last Name (un) **] in house and was maintained on
a tight insulin sliding scale with glargine recomended and
implemented with adjustments.  Pt will need tight followup with
dr [**Last Name (STitle) 14116**] at [**Last Name (un) 387**] on discharge.
.
6. ARF: Baseline creatinine 0.9-1.0, on admission 1.6, max 2.0
s/p catheterization.  Unsure etiology, but likely with contrast
nephropathy compoundation- trended down nicely.  [**Last Name (un) **] restarted
HD3.
