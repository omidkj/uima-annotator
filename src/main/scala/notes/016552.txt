Admission Date:  [**2185-10-27**]       Discharge Date:  [**2185-10-31**]


Service:  CCU

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a [**Age over 90 **] year old
female with a history of congestive heart failure, coronary
artery disease, reported myocardial infarction, transferred
to [**Hospital1 69**] from [**Hospital6 4299**] after being intubated there for respiratory
distress.  The patient had been admitted to [**Hospital6 8278**] four weeks ago and had reportedly ruled in for
myocardial infarction there and refused further intervention.
After discharge, the patient had tried treatment with
sublingual Nitroglycerin but had recurrent and more frequent
anginal episodes.  The patient also had been discharged on
Bumex but had skipped doses.  In the past day prior to
admission, the patient had increasing symptoms of congestive
heart failure including paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea as well
as increasing angina not relieved by sublingual
Nitroglycerin.  The patient was taken to [**Hospital6 8278**].  Initial blood pressure there was 200/79.  The
patient received 4 mg of Morphine, 100 mg intravenous Lasix,
intravenous Nitroglycerin, Bumex 2 mg with no improvement.
Chest x-ray done there showed congestive heart failure.
Electrocardiogram done there showed left bundle branch block,
heart rate in the 120s.  The patient was intubated with
subsequent drop in her blood pressure to 104/44.  The patient
was then transferred to [**Hospital1 69**]
for CCU evaluation.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  No tobacco, no alcohol.

FAMILY HISTORY:  No coronary artery disease as per husband.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On physical examination, vital signs
revealed temperature of 97.4, pulse 76, blood pressure
127/36, respiratory rate 10, OT 100% on ventilator assist
control, tidal volume 500, respiratory rate 10, PEEP 8, FIO2
0.6.  Generally, an elderly female intubated, sedated and
unresponsive.  Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat examination
- dry mucous membranes.  The pupils are equal, round, and
reactive to light and accommodation.  Neck - increased
jugular venous distention, no carotid bruit.  Cardiovascular
- III/VI diamond shaped murmur at right upper sternal border,
III/VI diastolic decrescendo murmur at right upper sternal
border, positive parasternal heave.  Pulmonary - coarse
breath sounds anteriorly.  Abdomen is soft, nondistended,
nontender.  Patches of dry skin.  Decreased bowel sounds.
Extremities - 1+ lower extremity edema, warm, 2+ dorsalis
pedis pulses bilaterally.

LABORATORY DATA:  White blood cell count 12.5, hematocrit
32.0, platelet count 134,000, 89% neutrophils, 6%
lymphocytes.  Chem7 revealed sodium 140, potassium 5.2,
chloride 107, bicarbonate 21, blood urea nitrogen 39,
creatinine 1.6, gap 12.0, glucose 239.  Digoxin level 1.9.
Prothrombin time 14.0, partial thromboplastin time 33.0, INR
1.4.  CK 88.

Chest x-ray showed bilateral pulmonary edema, right layer
diffusion, left lower lobe consolidation.

Electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm at 74 beats per
minute, left bundle branch block, increased Q-Tc interval, ST
depression and T wave inversions in I, aVL, V5 and V6.

INITIAL ASSESSMENT:  A [**Age over 90 **] year old female with aortic valve
disease who comes to [**Hospital1 69**]
with respiratory decompensation, most likely due to poor
cardiac forward flow and also with left lower lobe pneumonia.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  Cardiovascular - pump - The patient is known to have both
aortic insufficiency and aortic stenosis.  The patient was
diuresed to decrease pulmonary edema and to decrease
afterload.  Blood pressure was initially supported with
Dopamine but this was able to be weaned easily.  The patient
had an echocardiogram on [**2185-10-27**], which showed a left
ventricular ejection fraction of less than 20%, elongated
left atrium, severe symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy,
overall severely depressed left ventricular systolic
function, small right ventricular cavity, markedly dilated
ascending aorta, severe 4+ aortic regurgitation and moderate
to large size pericardial effusion with right ventricular
compression and sustained right atrial collapse consistent
with elevated pericardial pressure or tamponade.  Upon
further investigation, it was discovered that this
pericardial effusion had been present for several years and
it was not drained as per patient request.  The patient also
refused a coronary catheterization.  The patient also refused
Swan-Ganz catheter monitoring to see if she had tamponade
physiology.  Beta blockers were avoided as this patient has
aortic insufficiency.  The patient was started on an ace
inhibitor and was switched to Imdur and was placed on a daily
dose of Lasix.

Rhythm - The patient was monitored on telemetry.  No
significant events were noted.

Coronary - The patient refused catheterization so thus unsure
of coronary status.  The patient most likely has coronary
artery disease.  The patient was kept on Aspirin.  The
patient was initially placed on Heparin and this was soon
discontinued.

2.  Pulmonary - The patient was intubated for pulmonary edema
and effusion and pneumonia with decreased respiratory status.
The patient was treated with diuresis and Levofloxacin.  The
patient was able to be weaned off ventilation on hospital day
two with no ill effects.  The patient continued to improve
her oxygen saturation throughout her hospital course and was
able to tolerate room air by the time of discharge.

3.  Infectious disease - The patient was treated empirically
for community acquired pneumonia with Levofloxacin.  The
patient did receive a dose of Ceftriaxone on day one.

Overall course, the patient was able to be extubated and
weaned off all pressors after diuresis and initiation of
antibiotic therapy.  The patient was able to work with
physical therapy and was felt to be ready for discharge to a
nursing facility by the end of hospital course.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Pulmonary edema secondary to congestive heart failure.
2.  Severe aortic insufficiency.
3.  Pericardial effusion.
4.  Left lower lobe pneumonia.
5.  Left bundle branch block on electrocardiogram.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
1.  Imdur 30 mg p.o. once daily.
2.  Lisinopril 20 mg p.o. once daily.
3.  Lasix 40 mg p.o. once daily.
4.  Potassium Chloride 20 meq p.o. once daily.
5.  Aspirin, enteric coated, 325 mg p.o. once daily.
6.  Levofloxacin 250 mg p.o. once daily until [**2185-11-6**], and
then stop.
7.  Colace 100 mg p.o. twice a day, hold for loose stools.
8.  Heparin 5000 units subcutaneous q12hours.
9.  Tylenol 325 mg to 650 mg p.o./PR q4-6hours p.r.n.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Good.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  To nursing facility on [**Hospital3 4298**].
The patient is to call primary care physician and
cardiologist for follow-up appointments.  Cardiologist faxed
over copy of electrocardiogram and echocardiogram reports.
