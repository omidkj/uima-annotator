ANTICIPATED DISCHARGE DATE:  [**2164-4-26**].

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Mental status changes.

HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an
80-year-old male with a history of metastatic prostate cancer
to bone and brain, who was noted to be sluggish with change
in mental status by the [**Hospital6 **] and by the
family.  The patient states that he felt in his usual state
of health.  He denied any shortness of breath, chest pain,
nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea.  He notes on admission that he
did not feel confused.  He was seen in the
Hematology/[**Hospital **] Clinic three days prior to admission and
at that time it was noted that he had difficulty
concentrating and processing information.  During that visit,
he was also started on ketoconazole and hydrocortisone for
his metastatic prostate cancer.

On presentation to the emergency room, he was found to have a
room-air saturation of 80%.  He had a CT angiogram of his
chest, which showed very large bilateral pulmonary emboli.
He had MRI of the head, which showed a new dural brain
metastases and a question of surrounding bleeding.  The
patient was not anticoagulated initially, and
neurology/oncology who knows the patient was consulted
regarding this decision.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Prostate cancer diagnosed about [**2149**].  The patient is
status post bilateral orchiectomy and status post
transurethral resection of the prostate in [**2163**], status post
medications to his temporal bone with craniotomy in
[**Month (only) 1096**],  [**2163**].  In [**2164-3-16**], the patient was found to
have metastatic disease to his jaw and scheduled to start
radiation on [**2164-4-17**].  The patient was seen by
Dr.  [**Last Name (STitle) **] and started on ketoconazole and hydrocortisone on
[**2164-4-11**].
2.  History of DVT in [**2147**], as well as on [**12-16**], at which
time he had an IVC filter placed.
3.  Hypertension.
4.  History of atrial fibrillation, now in normal sinus on
Quinidine and Digoxin.

Prior to the patient's craniotomy, he was fully functional in
an independent and active lifestyle.  He was educated through
the third grade.  He was in WWII.  He was very active in the
civil rights movement in the [**2122**].  He denies any alcohol or
tobacco.

FAMILY HISTORY:  History is noncontributory.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Examination revealed the following:
Vital signs:  On admission temperature was 98.3, heart rate
64, blood pressure 161/47, oxygen saturation initially 80 on
room air and 99 on two liters with a respiratory rate of 19.
GENERAL:  The patient was alert, oriented to year, place, but
not month and very slow to respond.

HEENT:  Pupils were equally round and reactive to light and
accommodation.  Extraocular muscles are intact.  Oropharynx
clear, no lymphadenopathy.  CARDIOVASCULAR:  Regular rate and
rhythm, normal S1 and S2, grade 2 out of 6 holosystolic
murmur at the left upper sternal border and [**2-22**] murmur at the
right upper sternal border.  Respiratory crackles at the
right base.  ABDOMEN:  Abdomen was nontender and
nondistended, positive bowel sounds.  EXTREMITIES:  1+ edema
bilaterally.  NEUROLOGICAL:  Cranial nerves II through XII
intact.  REFLEXES:  Bilateral 5/5 strength in the upper and
lower extremities.

LABORATORY DATA:  Laboratory studies on admission revealed
the following:  White count 6.2, hematocrit 33.5, platelet
count 246, PT 12.4, PTT 27.6, INR 1.1, MCV 90.1, sodium 142,
potassium 3.9, chloride 106, bicarbonate 30, BUN 13,
creatinine 1.2 and glucose 121.  Differential:  67
neutrophils, 4 bands, 15 lymphs, 12 monocytes, 1 atypical,
ALT 9, AST 12, alkaline phosphatase 228, total bilirubin 0.6,
albumin 4.1, calcium 9.4, phosphorus 3.6, magnesium 2.0.
Urinalysis negative.  ABG, 7.38, 59, and 22, (venous).

EKG:  Normal sinus at 86, normal axis.  No ST or T wave
changes.  CT angiogram bowed bilateral atelectasis, calcified
nodule, massive PE.  Chest x-ray showed possible left lower
lobe infiltrate.

Findings on the MRI showed a new focus dural-based tumor
1  x 1.5 cm in the right parietal region with similar
contrast to the original right temporal-dural based tumor,
which was resected.  There is a solitary punctate region of
restrictive diffusion in the right parietal cortex, which
could represent a minute area of ischemia and signs of
chronic microvascular infarction in the cerebellum.

The patient also had a CT of the head, which showed status
post craniotomy and tumor resection, methacrylate prosthesis
and surgical changes, hyperdense enhancing foci anterior to
the right frontal lobe and right occipital lobe concerning
for a small foci of hemorrhage or tumor; MRI followed that CT
scan.

HOSPITAL COURSE:

PULMONARY:  The patient was admitted with a very massive
pulmonary emboli.  Due to his malignancy there was concern
regarding starting of anticoagulation.  He was seen by the
Department of Neurological Oncology, who has been following
him and who reviewed the imaging studies.  It was thought to
be consistent with a new dural metastases and bleed in the
dura or brain parenchyma.  We thought it would be safe to
anticoagulate with Heparin.

The patient was started on heparin on [**2164-4-17**], continued
through [**2164-4-21**].  Heparin was then discontinued after the
patient suffered intracranial bleeding as noted below.  The
patient remained with good oxygen saturation throughout the
hospital course and he was never symptomatic from his PE.  It
was thought that may be this was chronic in nature and the
Department of Radiology could not determine whether it was
acute or chronic.  He will not be on anticoagulation for the
PE.  He does have [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 260**] filter in place that failed.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] discussed the case with the Department of
Vascular Surgery, who did not feel a surgical resection of
the PE was appropriate at this time.

NEUROLOGICAL:  The patient was admitted with delta MS thought
to be secondary to his hypoxia from the PE and possibly from
new or old brain metastases.  He was noted over the 5th and
6th to have a decline in his mental status with word-finding
difficulties and some visual changes.  He was also noted to
have spiking temperatures.  At that time a CT scan of the
head was obtained due to the concern over mental status
changes.  This showed a large occipital bleed about 5 cm in
size.  At that time, anticoagulation was discontinued and the
patient was seen by the Department of Neurosurgery.  The
Department of Neurosurgery did not feel that intervention was
appropriate and the patient was monitored in the ICU setting
for two days.  Repeat CT scan showed no increase size in the
bleed.  The patient's neurological examination remained
stable.  At the time of discharge, the patient continued to
have word-finding difficulties, as well as left-sided visual
deficits and neglect.  He needs assistance with all
activities secondary to these defects.  Of note:  The patient
had an EEG performed on the 5th when there were concerns
about mental status changes.  This showed slowing over the
right hemisphere suggesting damage or dysfunction of the
cortical matter on the right and widespread mild
encephalopathy, no epileptic forms were seen.  After the
patie
