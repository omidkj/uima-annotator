History of Present Illness:
Pt is a 87 yo Greek speaking male with PMHx significant for CAD
s/p MI w/ pacemaker in [**6-29**], PVD, and CVA admitted fot cardiac
catheterization after presenting to [**Hospital 1474**] Hospital w/ chest
pain.  History provided largely by patient's son who acted as
translator.  Son noticed that his father had used nine
nitroglycerin tablets since the [**10-26**].  Pt apparently had used
[**7-4**] nitroglycerin tablets for a 24 hour period between
[**Date range (1) 43799**].  He states father was complaining of pressure in his
chest typical of past heart attack symptoms.  He also
experienced some tingling in his lips.  Pt reports experiencing
the pressure while at rest but did not report any heart
palpitations, shortness of breath, or sweating.  Per son, his
father has had some increased swelling in his legs since

to [**Name (NI) 1474**] Hospital.

Pertinent Results:
[**11-1**] ECG - Sinus rhythm, Ventricular paced rhythm
.
[**11-1**] Cardiac catheterizaton -

1.  Selective coronary angiography revealed a left-dominant
system with
severe left main and 3-vessel coronary disease.  The LMCA had a
90%
ulcerated ostial lesion and a 60% distal lesion.  The LAD had
moderate
diffuse disease throughout and an occluded large first diagonal
branch
which fills via left-left collaterals.  The LCx is a dominant
vessel
with an 80% stenosis in the proximal OM1 branch.  The RCA is
nondominant
small vessel and subtotally occluded in the proximal portion.
2. Limited venography of the IVC revealed a small saccular
dilation of
the superior IVC just proximal to right atrium.
3. Resting hemodynamics revealed elevated right-sided filling
pressures
and markedly elevated left-sided filling pressures (mean RA 12
mmHg and
mean PCW 34 mmHg with somewhat prominent V-waves to 47 mmHg).
The PA
pressure is moderately elevated (mean PA 44 mmHg).  The cardiac
index is
low-normal at 2.1 L/min/m2.
3.  Supravalvular aortography revealed 1+ aortic regurgitation.
Limited
peripheral angiography of the left iliac system revealed a
widely patent
proximal iliac stent and mild-moderate diffuse disease distal to
the
stent.
4.  Due to severe left main disease and ongoing chest
discomfort,
a 7 French 30 cc intra-aortic balloon pump was inserted.
Balloon
inflation timing was optimized for diastolic augmentation and
systolic
unloading.

[**11-2**] TTE - The left atrium is elongated. A left-to-right shunt
across the interatrial  septum is seen at rest consistent with
the presence of an atrial septal
defect. There is left ventricular hypertrophy with thinned
inferolateral wall.
The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left
ventricular systolic
function is mildly depressed. Resting regional wall motion
abnormalities
include inferolateral akinesis and anterolateral hypokinesis.
Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
ascending aorta
is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately
thickened. There
is mild to moderate aortic valve stenosis. Mild to moderate
([**11-26**]+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Mild
(1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary
artery systolic
hypertension. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial
effusion.

[**11-3**] Cardiac catheterization - 1. Resting hemodynamics revealed
mildly elevated filling
pressures with low C.I.
2. IABP was adjusted and mean BP was 80, unloaded systolic BP
was 105,
augmented diastolic BP was 122.
3. Selective coronary angiography revealed of this left dominant
system
revealed a 90% thrombotic, ulcerated LM stenosis, a 70% distal
LM
stenosis, a 90% ostial LAD stenosis, a 100% D1 steonosis, a
diffuse up
to 50% LCX stenosis and a 80% ostial OM1 stenosis. The RCA was
not
filmed.
4. Successful stenting of the ostial LM with a 3.5x8mm CYpher
[**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **]
[**Last Name (Prefixes) 7930**] to 4.5 (See PTCA comments).
5. Successful stenting of the distal LM/ostial LAD with a
3.5x23mm
Cypher DES (overlapping with the ostial LM stent) postdilated to
4.5
(See PTCA comments).
6. Successful rescue /baloon PTCA of the ostial LCX with a
2.5x9mm NC
Ranger at 14 atms (See PTCA comments).
7. Abdominal aortography revealed patent celiac and mesenteric
arteries
with no evidence of thronbotic/embolic occlusion of the major
branches.
The ostium of the celiac artery had a 60% stenosis.

[**11-4**] TTE - 1. There is severe symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. There is a generalized
dyssynchronous
motion and mild global left ventricular hypokinesis. Overall
left ventricular
systolic function is mildly depressed.
2. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. Mild to
moderate ([**11-26**]+)
aortic regurgitation is seen.
3. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is
moderate
thickening of the mitral valve chordae. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is
seen.
4. There is a small, echo dense, pericardial effusion.
5. Compared with the findings of the prior study of [**2174-11-2**],
there has been no
significant change.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was initially taken to the cath lab where he was
found to have a 90% LMCA occlusion and an 80% LCX occlusion.  He
was transferred to the CCU with an IABP given a PCWP pf 34 in
the cath lab.  An LMCA stent was planned for later in the
hospitalization.  In the interim he was maintained on aspirin,
lipitor, heparin, and plavix.  [**11-2**] PM the patient complained of
vague abdominal.  He was also noted to have a drop in cardiac
index from 1.9 -> 1.5.  Dobutamine was then started.  ~ 6 AM on
[**11-3**] the patient was noted to have a drop in BP.  As a result,
dopamine and levophed were initiated.  He was noted to be barely
arousable with an ABG 7.26/49/99/26.  Pt also found to be
diaphoretic with a Pa02 of 80-84% and was intubated.  The
patient developed ARF with a Cr rise from 1.1 - > 1.9 as well as
a lactate of 5.4   This was all deemed to be from hyperperfusion
from cardiogenic shock with a possible component of septic shock
due to an abdominal source.  A conversat
