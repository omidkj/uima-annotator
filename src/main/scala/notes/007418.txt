History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 77869**] is a 77 y.o. M well known to the MICU [**Location (un) **]
team with h/o afib on coumadin, dementia, DM, CHF, recent right
hemiarthroplasty of the hip who presented to and OSH after being
found unresponsive and hypotensive in the setting of oxycodone
at NH. Before admission, pt was being treated for C. diff, with
positive assay noted at NH 2 weeks PTA (had a course of PO
flagyl but still had diarrhea so was changed to PO vanc). At OSH
CT ABD showed pan colitis. Pt was stabilized with IVF digoxin
for a fib and transfered to [**Hospital1 18**]. At BICMC surgery evaluated
and felt the collitis to be most likely infectious. Pt was
hypotensive in the ED so went to the MICU. In the MICU PO vanc
was continued and PO flagyl was added for C. Diff. BP stabilized
to basline of SBP 90-100 with fluid resuscitation - no pressors
were required. All cultures negative since admission. C. Diff
assay has been negative here, but he has continued to have
diarrhea. He was transferred to the floor with stable VS.
.
On the floor, he has had a worsening polyarticular gout flare.
He was restarted on his home colchicine and probenacid with
little relief of symptoms. Rheumatology was consulted and
recommended a steroid taper, but the floor team decided to hold
off on this in the setting of infection. UA was positive after
transfer and cipro was started empirically.
.
On the afternoon after transfer, he triggered for low urine
output. This was felt to be due to hypovolemia and he was given
1L of 1/2NS because of concern for hypernatremia. By 10pm he had
made ~500cc urine since midnight. He was then hypotensive to
mid-80s systolic. At that time he was afebrile and it was felt
that hypotension was still most likely due to hypovolemia. He
received 500cc NS with good effect (SBP to 100s). Following this
he became febrile to 100.8, BP returned to mid-80s systolic.
Continue to have very poor urine output. Blood pressure and
urine output did not respond to a further 1L of NS. Mental
status grossly the same although patient has baseline dementia.
Was unable to swallow pills however which is reportedly new. On
repeat exam patient was felt to have mild guarding although he
denied pain, he did not have rebound tenderness. CXR did not
show free air. Given possibility of urosepsis with resistant
organism, Cipro was broadened to Zosyn.

With volume resuscitation, patient began to get more edematous
in lower extremities and scrotum. He continued to breathe
comfortably on room air however O2 saturation went from 99-100%
to 94-95%.

On arrival, he was unable to give additional details of history.
He denies CP, SOB, orthopnea, PND, cough, abdominal pain, N/V.

He does complain of joint pain and stiffness in his arms
especially.

STUDIES:
========
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2183-3-10**]
Portable AP chest radiograph compared to previous study obtained
the same day earlier at 04:17.

The right internal jugular line tip is in the distal SVC. The
mild cardiomegaly is unchanged. There is interval improvement in
perihilar interstitial prominence and bibasilar opacities
suggesting resolution of mild pulmonary edema. There is no
pleural effusion or pneumothorax.

ABDOMEN (SUPINE ONLY)  [**2183-3-10**]
FINDINGS: Please note, the detection of free air on a supine
abdominal radiograph is limited. No gross abdominal free air is
noted. There are several mildly distended air-filled loops of
small bowel in the left and mid abdomen. Air is noted throughout
the colon and rectum as well.
There are mild-to-moderate degenerative changes involving the
lumbar-sacral spine. The patient is status post right femoral
hip prosthesis.
IMPRESSION: Limited examination for the assessment of free air.
Unremarkable bowel gas pattern.

EKG [**2183-3-10**]
Baseline artifact. Irregular rhythm, probably atrial
fibrillation although
baseline artifact makes assessment difficult. Ventricular
premature beats.
Low QRS voltage. Delayed R wave progression with late precordial
QRS transition is non-specific but cannot exclude prior septal
myocardial infarction. Diffuse non-specific ST-T wave
abnormalities. Clinical correlation is suggested.  No previous
tracing available for comparison.

Portable TTE (Complete) Done [**2183-3-10**]
The left atrium is elongated. No left atrial mass/thrombus seen
(best excluded by transesophageal echocardiography). Left
ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. Due to
suboptimal technical quality, a f
