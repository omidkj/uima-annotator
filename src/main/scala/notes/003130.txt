Chief Complaint:
Chest pain, hypotension

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none


History of Present Illness:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 31769**] is an 81F with hx of AS (valve area 1.0-1.2
cm2), AR, HTN, DVT x3, dyslipidemia, COPD, PMR, mild pulmonary
HTN, initially admitted to [**Hospital1 1516**] for chest pain and new atrial
fibrillation, now transferred to CCU for hypotension.
.
See nightfloat admission note for full details of initial
presentation. Briefly, the patient developed substernal chest
pain that awoke her from sleep about 24 hours ago. The pain has
an aching quality and is non-exertional and non-pleuritic.  She
has not previously had this type of chest pain, so she presented
to the [**Hospital1 18**] ER for further evaluation.
.
In the ED, the patient had bradycardia at 44bpm. Her HR
initially ranged 42-44 and she was asymptomatic at that time.
She then went into atrial fibrillation with HR in the 90's with
associated decrease in BP of 80's-90's. She was given multiple
250cc boluses for a total of 1.75L in the ED to maintain her BP
between 80's-100's systolic. She remained asymptomatic
throughout. CTA was negative for a PE. CXR was negative. She had
a positive UA and was given Cipro IV x1 and Lovenox in the ED.
Ce's were neg x1.  Overnight she continued to have intermittent
episodes of hypotension with SBP's in the 80's, so her
antibiotic coverage was broadened to unasyn, and planned to be
transferred to the CCU for a TEE and cardioversion once a bed
became available.  Prior to transfer to the CCU her blood
pressure again dropped to the 80's systolic and she required
another 250cc bolus.
.
On arrival to the CCU her initial VS were: 75, 99/37, 24, 95% on
RA, she is well appearing and denies shortness of breath,
lightheadedness, nausea, palpitations, or other symptoms. She
does report continued mild chest pain that has improved
throughout her stay.  She says that she is not excited about her
upcoming procedures but is willing to undergo the TEE and
cardioversion.  She says that she has never been in A.fib
before.  Shortly after arrival to the CCU she spontaneously
converted to NSR with ectopy.
.
On review of systems, she denies any prior history of stroke,
afib, fevers, cough, dysuria, polyuria or increased frequency,
diarrhea. All of the other review of systems were negative.

STUDIES:
CXR [**2128-1-29**]:
IMPRESSION: Interval slight enlargement of the cardiac
silhouette likely
indicating cardiomegaly, although pericardial effusion remains
within the
differential diagnosis. No acute pulmonary process.
.
CTA [**2128-1-29**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. No acute pulmonary embolism or aortic pathology.
2. 8-mm right thyroid nodule. If clinically indicated, recommend
non-emergent thyroid ultrasound to further characterize.
.
TTE [**2128-1-31**]:
Conclusions
The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thickness,
cavity size and regional/global systolic function are normal
(LVEF >55%). There is no ventricular septal defect. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. There is
severe aortic valve stenosis (valve area 0.8-1.0cm2). Mild to
moderate ([**12-7**]+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral
regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.] The
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is mild
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2127-10-9**],
the degree of AS calculated is now severe.

Brief Hospital Course:
HOSPITAL COURSE:
Pt is a 81F with hx of AS (valve area 1.0-1.2 cm2), AR, HTN, DVT
x3, dyslipidemia, COPD, PMR, mild pulmonary HTN who presented
with chest pain, now with new onset of atrial fibrillation with
hypotension when her rates increase to the 90's. She briefly
converted spontaneously to SR, but returned to atrial
fibrillation and was started on Amiodarone [**1-30**] initially with
bolus therapy
.
ACTIVE ISSUES:
# ATRIAL FIBRILLATION: The patient was admitted from [**Hospital1 **] to the
CCU for TEE cardioversion for hypotension in setting of atrial
fibrillation. The patient flipped into sinus on admission to the
CCU floor and was normotensive.  She was loaded with IV
amiodarone. Given persistent heart rates in the 50s with brief
bradycardic epsiodes to 30s and frequent ectopy the patient was
monitored overnight in the CCU.  She remained in sinus
overnight, with heart rates stable in the 50-60s with normal
