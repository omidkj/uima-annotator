Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7333**]
Chief Complaint:
fall

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **] y/o DNR/DNI female with HTN, HLD, mild dementia, who
presented to [**Hospital1 18**] ED today in setting of fall. Per discussion
with patient, she has not been in her usual state of health for
the past 1 week. She denies CP or SOB, but reports diaphoresis
and feeling generally unwell for the past week. Today, she came
in for evaluation of her fall.
.
Per [**Hospital3 **] and daughter, the fall occured 2 days ago
and was unwitnessed and she was found awake on the floor. Per
patient, she felt dizzy, had +LOC, and fell without any
pulmonary or cardiac symptoms prior. She refused to go to
hospital. Over the course of the next day, her breathing became
labored and her mental status had changed and she was confused.
She refused to go to the hospital until today.
.
In the ED, there was concern for head trauma. She also reported
pain in R arm and L hip. CT head and spine without acute
pathology. Also had CT spine showing grade II anterolisthesis of
C3 on C4, likely chronic. Imaging of spine, pelvis, hip, elbow,
and shoulder were all normal, without acute pathology, per
prelim read. CXR without acute pathology.
.
EKG was notable for non-specific ST-T wave changes, no prior for
comparison. Her troponin was 0.66. Cardiology was consulted for
NSTEMI. Aspirin and heparin gtt was initiated, with plan for
admission to [**Hospital1 1516**].
.
However, per ED, patient became "poorly responsive" at 6 pm.
Repeat Head CT performed due to concern for ICH, as patient was
started on heparin. Head CT was negative. A 2nd set of CE's was
drawn and troponin was 1.10. EKG was checked and patient had new
ST elevations in V3-V5, with concern for STEMI. Patient's mental
status was now reported as back to baseline. She denied CP or
SOB and did not have any symptoms. ED spoke with the family and
daughter, and initial plan was for cardiac cath. Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **] was
called in. Cardiology was re-consulted. Bedside echo showed that
her anterior inferior wall was down, but time course was
unclear.
.
Patient was placed on heparin gtt again, and given eptifibatide
(plavix was ordered but pt unable to swallow). Upon discussion
with cardiology, and given overall clinical picture along with
patient's desire to not proceed with cardiac cath, this was
deferred. Plan to admit to CCU due to evolving STEMI with
consideration for cath if patient develops any symptoms.
.
On transfer, vs: afebrile, 68, 151/90, 24, 100 2L (94% RA), no
CP. She is AOx2 and has 1 PIV.
.
In CCU, pts vitals: afebrile, BP 142/84,HR 74, 95% on 3L. Pt
reports some diapharesis in the ED but currently denies any
chest pain, no diapharesis, no nausea, no jaw pain, no SOB.
.
Pt currently denies any chest pain, no shortness of breath, does
report constipation, no headaches, no neurological changes,
remainder of ROS is negtive.

Brief Hospital Course:
[**Age over 90 **] F with h/o HLD and HTN admitted for fall found to have STEMI
(suspected to be in LAD territory given ST changes in V1-3). Pt
and family declined cardiac cath and wished to proceed with
solely medical management.  CK-MB peaked at 20, Trop rose to
1.59.  Pt was treated with aggressive medical management for
STEMI with aspirin, bb, integrillin gtt, lisinopril.  However,
renal failure persisted, and pt began experiencing respiratory
distress from fluid overload.  No intervention was pursued, and
patient was made CMO.  Shortly thereafter, pt passed away.
