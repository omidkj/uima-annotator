HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient was evaluated in the
Emergency Room on [**2185-5-12**] with acute onset of shortness
of breath and anterior chest discomfort, associated with
nausea, cough and diaphoresis.  The pain was graded as a 3 to
10.  He had undergone on the previous day on an outpatient
basis a femoral arteriogram and has reconstructible
femoral-popliteal pedal disease.  Cardiac enzymes obtained in
the Emergency Room was CK total 121 with MB of 11, CK MB
index was 9.1, troponin 17.2.  The patient was admitted for
further evaluation and care of his acute coronary syndrome.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Illnesses - Insulin dependent diabetes
mellitus times 27 years, his hemoglobin A1c is 9.3 with a
history of hypertension, diabetic neuropathy, he is status
post left eye surgery secondary to recurrent hemorrhages.  He
has had multiple foot surgeries secondary to foot
ulcerations.  He has a nonhealing left foot ulcer and
underwent an arteriogram and will require a left
femoral-popliteal bypass graft.

ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Zestril 40 mg b.i.d., Nifedipine
90 mg b.i.d., NPH 30 units q. AM and q. PM, Aspirin 325 mg
daily and Augmentin.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  He is retired.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Examination in the Emergency Room
showed vital signs 98.8, blood pressure 110/60, respirations
22, pulserate 88, 97% on 10 liters of face mask.  General
appearance, this is an alert, awake male in no acute
distress.  Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat examination is
unremarkable.  His jugulovenous distension is at 10 cm.  The
neck is supple.  Lungs, crackles halfway up the posterior
chest walls bilaterally.  The heart is a regular rate and
rhythm, normal S1 and S2, questionable S4.  There are no
murmurs.  Abdominal examination is unremarkable.  Groin
examination shows a palpable femoral pulse bilaterally
without bruits and the angiography site on the left groin is
clean, dry and intact.  There is 1+ edema of the extremities
bilaterally on the left foot, there is a 2 cm ulceration on
the plantar surface of the foot.  The patient's distal pulses
are not palpable but the feet are warm bilaterally.

LABORATORY DATA:  The patient was evaluated in the Emergency
Room, complete blood count showed a white count of 15.1,
hematocrit 29.2, platelets 323, BUN 35, creatinine 1.5,
potassium 5.1.  Urinalysis was positive for glucose and
protein.  Chest x-ray showed pulmonary edema.  The
electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm with a
ventricular rate of 100 and normal axis with ST depressions
of 0.5 to 1.0 mm in V4, 5 and 6.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the Cardiac
Service and Vascular was notified of the admission.  The
patient received Aspirin and intravenous Heparin was begun
and beta blockade was begun to maintain a heartrate goal of
less than 70.  The Zestril was held because of an increase in
creatinine and need for continued diuresis.  A Foley catheter
was placed to monitor urinary output and intravenous
Nitroglycerin which was continued for angina control and
afterload.  The patient required intravenous Morphine Sulfate
on a prn basis for pain.  His CK and troponins were cycled.
His diabetes is poorly controlled with admitting fasting
glucose of 450.  His insulin was adjusted as needed and
monitored.  For the left foot he was continued on the
Augmentin and he had dry sterile dressings to the foot daily.
The patient was seen on the following day by Vascular and
their recommendations were to continue the current wound
care.  They recommended echocardiogram with continued
diuresis for congestive heart failure, await cardiac
catheterization results and cover the wound with
Levofloxacin, Flagyl and Oxacillin for the cellulitis.
Podiatry was also notified of the patient's admission and
they followed the patient also.  Infectious Disease was
consulted for management of the patient's antibiotic regimen.
Blood cultures were obtained on admission and the following
day.  Recommendations were to continue intravenous Unasyn,
duration of therapy to be determined by foot imaging.  Foot
films were obtained which were positive for osteomyelitis.
Blood cultures remained negative.  The patient underwent
cardiac catheterization on [**2185-5-16**].  His foot cultures
grew mixed Flora, moderate growth of coagulase positive
Staphylococcus, moderate growth of Corynebacterium and sparse
growth of gram negative rods.  Preliminary catheterization
demonstrated ejection fraction of 44% with three vessel
disease of the right coronary artery, left anterior
descending and circumflex with 70% stenosis.  The
ventriculogram demonstrated anterior basal hypokinesis,
anterolateral hypokinesis, apical hypokinesis and inferior
hypokinesis with posterior basal hypokinesis.  Cardiothoracic
Surgery was consulted and the patient underwent on [**2185-5-18**], coronary artery vascularization with a left internal
mammary artery to the left anterior descending, saphenous
vein graft to the obtuse marginal plus diagonal, and a
saphenous vein graft to the distal right coronary artery by
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  Postoperatively he did well.  He continued to
require transfusion for a hematocrit of 24.1.  His Unasyn was
continued.  His mediastinal tubes were discontinued on
postoperative day #2.  Pleural tubes were removed on
postoperative day #4.  Gavage removed on postoperative day
#6.  The patient was transferred to the Vascular Surgery for
further surgical intervention during his Intensive Care Unit
stay.  The patient was followed by Vascular and Podiatry.  He
did undergo a debridement at the bedside.  Physical therapy
began to work with the patient who was nonweightbearing.  On
[**2185-5-26**] the patient underwent a left femoral-popliteal
bypass with in situ saphenous vein and angioscope with valve
lysis.  He tolerated the procedure well and required 2 units
of packed red blood cells intraoperatively.  He was
transferred to the Post Anesthesia Care Unit in stable
condition with a palpable dorsalis pedis and palpable graft
pulse.  His postoperative hematocrit remained stable at 30.7.
He continued to do well and required nitroglycerin for
afterload reduction and for a systolic blood pressure of 165
and his PAD was 44 an 20 with a CVP of 9.  On postoperative
day #1 there were no overnight events.  His potassium was 6.7
and he was given Kayexalate for his potassium.  The fluids
were to KDO and his diet was advanced.  He remained on
bedrest.  He remained on the Vascular Intensive Care Unit,
continued on Unasyn.  He developed a temperature and a
leukocytosis with a total white count of 18.  Blood and urine
cultures were sent.  Stool for Clostridium difficile was
sent.  The patient was weaned off of the nitroglycerin drip
on postoperative day #2.  He was D-lined.  He was allowed
bathroom privileges.  He was transfused 1 unit of packed red
blood cells with Lasix for a hematocrit of 26.4.  His CKs and
troponin levels remained flat.  He was transferred to the
regular nursing floor on postoperative day #2.  Post
transfusion hematocrit was 32.5.  His BUN and creatinine were
stabilized at 14 and 1.0 on postoperative day #4.  [**Hospital1 **]
was consulted for management of his diabetes insulin machine.
On [**2185-6-1**] the patient underwent a first metatarsal head
resection.  He tolerated the procedure well and was
transferred to the Post Anesthesia Care Unit in stable
condition.  The remainder of the hospital course was
unremarkable.  The patient's bypass graft wounds were clean,
dry and intact with a functioning graft.  The metatarsal head
resection site suture line remained intact.  Dressings were
dry sterile dressings, q.d.  Mediastinal wound was clean, dry
and intact.  The patient was evaluated by physical therapy
for nonweightbearing and rehabilitation was requested to
screen the patient for consideration of continued cardiac
rehabilitation and ambulation.  At the time of discharge our
recommendat
