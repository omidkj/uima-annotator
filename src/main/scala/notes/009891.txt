Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to the Trauma Surgical ICU (as a boarder
in the MICU) for q2h neurochecks due to her traumatic head
injury. She had a repeat CT scan of the head on [**2127-10-24**] which
showed resolution of her SAH. Her diet was advanced and her pain
well controlled on oral pain medications. She was restarted on
all of her home meds except for her aspirin. Due to her stable
neuro exam, she was deemed fit for discharge into the care of
her husband.

She was seen in consult by both orthopedics and neurosurgery.
For her L clavicular fracture, ortho recommended a sling for
comfort and follow up in clinic in 2 weeks. Neurosurgery
evaluated her both on admission and on HD 2 and reviewed her
CTs. Because of her stability, they agreed that she could be
discharged home with follow up only on a prn basis.

Mrs. [**Known lastname **] will follow up in clinic with ortho in 2 weeks and
with ACS and NSURG on an as needed basis. She has been given
strict instructions to return to the ED for worsening confusion,
seizures, or any other concerning symptom.
