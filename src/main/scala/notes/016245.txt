Brief Hospital Course:
79yo F with history of abdominal aortic aneurysm repair 4 months
ago, hypertension and hyperlipidemia presents with type B aortic
dissection. CT abdomen done in the ED showed aortic dissection
about 3cm off left subclavian vein and extend 4cm confined to
the thorax. CT surgery was consulted and agrees to just medical
manegement. SHe was transferred to the CCU for blood pressure
monitoring. She was initially on esmolol and nipride and was
weaned off the next day to oral blood pressure medication. She
was transitioned to labetolol, captopril and norvasc which were
titrated up to control her blood pressure. Upon discharge, her
blood pressure was better controlled. She would need close
follow up as outpatient to make sure her blood pressure is well
controlled.

SHe has no end organ damage during her hospital stay. There was
no new heart murmur, her renal function remained stable, good
peripheral pulses, serial lactate level was normal, serial neuro
exam normal. Echocardiogram was performed on [**2-4**] which showed
EF>75%, no mass/thrombi, no VSD, wall motion normal, no aortic
stenosis and 1+Aortic regurgitation. CT chest/abdomen was
repeated on [**2-8**] for complain of chest pain radiating to the
back. That showed no progression of aortic dissection and no
bowel ischemia.

She has diffuse pain complain while in the hospital . This
included headache, periumbilical pain, back pain and knee pain.
These are all chronic pain and patient is on neurontin. She
would follow up with her PCP for that.

She remained on aspirin and lipitor for coronary artery disease.
Her CXR was consistent with left lower lobe pneumonia and since
she was febrile, she was started on levofloxacin for a course of
10 days.
