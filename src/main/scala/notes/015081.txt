Service:  CCU MEDICINE

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Shortness of breath, swollen ankles and
legs.  Sluggish.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS;  This is a 53 year old woman with
a history of coronary artery disease (had myocardial
infarction with a stent to mid left anterior descending
[**2131-6-15**], complicated by dinephropathy with a creatinine
elevated to 9.0, who is followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 120**] for her
cardiology care), congestive heart failure with an ejection
fraction of 40% apical akinesis, pulmonary hypertension,
diabetes mellitus complicated by retinopathy and nephropathy
with a baseline creatinine of 2.2 followed by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 10083**], who was recently discharged from the [**Hospital1 346**] on [**2131-6-21**], following an admission
for congestive heart failure/myocardial infarction.

The patient was noted to still be short of breath, sluggish
and winded as well as have edematous extremities.  Since the
time of her discharge, her husband notes that her symptoms
had been causing her distress.  Five days prior to admission
for these symptoms, her husband brought her to the Emergency
Department here at [**Hospital1 69**] where
she was seen and then discharged.  It was felt that she did
not have severe congestive heart failure at that time.

On the day of admission, the patient's symptoms were noted to
be worse and in consultation with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 10083**], her
nephrologist and with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 120**], her cardiologist, she
returned to the Emergency Department about noon.  Around 3:30
p.m., she was short of breath on oxygen and had a low serum
glucose.  She was given juice and crackles and immediately
became nauseated and short of breath with oxygen saturation
dropping to 75% on 100% nonrebreather.  The chest x-ray
appeared to have larger effusions than prior studies and she
was soon intubated for respiratory failure.

Additionally, she got Edecrin 12.5 mg times two during her
course.  She was then transferred to the Coronary Care Unit
for further evaluation and management.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Status post myocardial infarction.  Echocardiogram done
    at Dr.[**Name (NI) 129**] office showed ejection fraction of 40%,
    mild global hypokinesis, slow apical akinesis, left
    ventricular hypertrophy, mitral regurgitation, mild left
    atrial enlargement, moderate tricuspid regurgitation and
    pulmonary hypertension.  Exercise stress test done at the
    time showed a fixed apical defect.
2.  Congestive heart failure.  She required hospitalization
    in [**2131-5-29**], at [**Hospital 19368**] Hospital as well as this hospital
    earlier in [**5-31**].  Severe pulmonary hypertension.
4.  Diabetes mellitus complicated by retinopathy and
    nephropathy, followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 9671**] in the [**Hospital **]
    Clinic.  She is on subcutaneous insulin.
5.  Osteomyelitis following traumatic foot injury.
6.  Dinephropathy from cardiac catheterization.

CARDIAC RISK FACTORS:
1.  Hypertension.
2.  Diabetes mellitus.
3.  Hypercholesterolemia (220, HDL 60.  This is a negative
    risk factor).

ALLERGIES:
1.  Sulfa causes hives.
2.  Beta blockers cause hypoglycemia masking.
3.  Aspirin unknown reaction.
4.  Lasix because it has Sulfa has caused hives in this
    patient.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1.  Sublingual Nitroglycerin p.r.n.
2.  Ventolin inhaler p.r.n.
3.  Atenolol 25 mg p.o. q.d. although the patient was not
    taking this medication at the time of admission.
4.  Hydralazine 50 mg p.o. t.i.d.
5.  Plavix 75 mg p.o. q.d.
6.  Edecrin 25 mg p.o. q.d.
7.  Singulair 10 mg p.o. q.d.
8.  Norvasc 10 mg p.o. q.d.
9.  Insulin 24 units NPH in the a.m. and then 4 units p.m.,
    regular insulin 4 units q.a.m. and 6 units q.p.m.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature is 99.8, heart rate 79 to
91, normal sinus rhythm, blood pressure 106 to 138 over 57 to
60 on Nitroglycerin intravenous drip.  The patient was on
assist control ventilation 600 times ten with 10 of PEEP,
FIO2 of 0.8.  In general, she was intubated and sedated.  Her
head, eyes, ears, nose and throat examination revealed an OG
tube as well as endotracheal tube.  Her pupils are equal,
round, and reactive to light and accommodation.  Her neck
showed elevated neck veins.  Her chest revealed decreased
breath sounds at the bases along with crackles.  Her heart
had distant sounds, regular rate and rhythm.  The abdomen was
soft, positive bowel sounds.  Extremities 2+ edema,
pneumoboots on.  Neurologically she was sedated.

LABORATORY DATA:  Hematocrit 25.7, white count 5.7, platelets
236,000.  TSH reviewed was 2.1.  Blood urea nitrogen 43 and
creatinine 2.5.  Troponin 3.5, CK 75 and the next one was 76.
Arterial blood gases before she was intubated 7.45/31/77.

Chest x-ray showed worsening effusions which layered
bilaterally, upwards on redistribution, hilar congestion.

Electrocardiogram showed a left bundle branch block with
normal sinus rhythm at 77 beats per minute with leftward
axis.

Cardiac catheterization from [**2131-6-15**], showed that it was
indicated for a woman with intermittent chest pressure and
congestive heart failure  Her right atrium was 8, right
ventricle 60/18 mmHg, pulmonary artery 60/25/38.  Her
pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) equals 25 mmHg.
Her cardiac output was measured at 8.1, her cardiac index
4.6, SVR 612, PVR 128.  Arteriography revealed a mid 60% and
distal 50% right coronary artery lesion and after
intervention her mid right coronary artery lesion was 40%
stenosed.  Her left coronary artery filled at normal left
main.  Her mid left anterior descending had a 90% stenosis.
Her proximal left anterior descending had 50% stenosis.  She
had a mid left anterior descending stent placed, 2.25 by 18
millimeter stent was deployed which showed 20% residual
stenosis with timi free flow.  Comments from this study
showed that she had a right dominant system, three vessel
disease, 90% mid left anterior descending and that her
hemodynamic response revealed pulmonary hypertension.  She
had her mid left anterior descending lesion stented and
nothing else was stented.

IMPRESSION:  A 53 year old woman with a history of coronary
artery disease, status post myocardial infarction, congestive
heart failure, dinephropathy, diabetes mellitus and diabetic
nephropathy who was admitted in acute pulmonary edema
requiring intubation and CCU care.  Etiologies of her
pulmonary edema include ischemia, worsening mitral
regurgitation, diastolic dysfunction, volume overload from
increased intake and decreased output, noncompliance or
inadequate dosing of medications and infectious etiologies,
pneumonia, which might have caused volume shift in her.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  Pulmonary edema - Initially the patient was treated with
diuresis, Morphine, nitrates, oxygen, and this resulted in
some improvement in her symptoms.  On [**2131-7-5**], diuresis was
held secondary to increase in her creatinine.  Her pneumonia
was treated.  On [**2131-7-6**], she was extubated but also started
on Vancomycin for single dose because she had staphylococcus
in her nasopharynx and then on [**2131-7-9**], once she had been
transferred to the floor, she was tolerating room air and her
standing dose of Edecrin.  In other words, her pulmonary
edema had resolved.

2.  Congestive heart failure - An echocardiogram was done on
[**2131-7-4**], which revealed moderate global hypokinesis, mild
left ventricular dilatation, right ventricular overload, 1 to
2+ mitral regurgitation, severe pulmonary hypertension, and
an injection fraction of 30 to 35%.  On [**2131-7-5**], attempts at
giving her Hydralazine were halted in favor of giving her
preload reduction with Nitroglycerin.  Beta blockers had not
yet been added, nor had ace inhibitors on [**2131-7-6**].  She was
back on Hydralazine and diuresing as tolerated on [**2131-7-9**].
She was maintained on diuresis and those medications.  On
[**2131-7-11**], she was restarted on Cozaar 50 mg p.o. q.d.

3.  Coronary artery disease - On [**2131-7-4**],
