History of Present Illness:
87 y/o F NH resident with PMH of CAD, dCHF, COPD on home O2 p/w
LLQ pain. The pain, which was new for her, began the night prior
to admission, as a severe intermittent sharp pain [**8-24**]. She
distinguishes this from pain she often feels in her right
abdomen after meals. She reports having been treated for a UTI
which caused her to have urinary frequency and dysuria, but that
the infection came back. The pain was unrelated to meals, and
was associated with nausea, as well as vomiting the morning of
admission. She also noted diarrhea, but unrelated to the
abdominal pain. She did not have CP, SOB, cough, wheezing,
orthopnea, hematuria, or edema. Blood work at the NH revealed
WBC 20,000 so the patient was referred to the ED.
In the ED T102.8 HR 97 BP 55/35 RR 24 92% RA. She received 2 L
NS, repeat BP was 101/45. Rec'd additional 3L NS without much
improvement in BP. UOP 150 cc in 3.5 hr. Blood and urine
cultures were sent. Rec'd [**Month/Year (2) 1378**] 750 IV, vanco 1 g IV, flagyl
500 mg IV for LLL infiltrate on CXR and +U/A. The patient is
DNR/DNI, and refused central line placement. She was transferred
to the ICU for further management of hypotension. V/S upon
transfer to the ICU T 96.2 HR 82 BP 85/40 RR 18 O2sat 99% 4LNC.

EKG - SR HR 96 LAD RBBB (old) TWI V4-V6 (new), no ST elev/depr.
c/w exam [**2147-11-7**]

Imaging:
[**2149-7-27**] CXR: (dictation) cardiomediastinal silhoutte unchanged,
hazy opacity at LL base effusion/atelectasis vs. infiltrate,
likely small right pleural effusion.

[**2149-7-27**] CT ABD:no evidence of diverticulitis or bowel
obstruction. moderate stool in rectum. moderate left
hydronephrosis and hydroureter, with prominent perinephric and
periureteral stranding. possible obstructing 6 mm stone at left
UVJ, though eval limited by artifact from left hip prosthesis.
Given clinical and UA findings, concerning for obstructive
pyelonephritis, though without IV contrast, this cannot be
confirmed. cardiomegaly and extensive vascular calcification.
large hiatal hernia.

[**7-30**]: Abd/pelvis CT:
1. Renal ureteric and bladder calculi. The calculus in the left
mid-ureter
region appears to have increased in size from 6 mm to 8 mm.

2. Moderate left hydronephrosis and hydroureter with perinephric
and
periureteral inflammatory stranding.

3. Newly developed peripancreatic fat stranding is concerning
for acute
pancreatitis.

4. Mild intra-hepatic biliary duct dilatation, most likely
secondary to
previous cholecystectomy. The common bile duct is mildly dilated
with
presence of stone.

5. Lung bases consolidations bilaterally, slightly increased on
the right
side than the previous examination.

6. Calcified lung granulomas which are stable from the previous
examinations.

7. Extensive vascular calcification consistent with significant
atherosclerotic disease. There is also saccular infrarenal
abdominal aortic
aneurysm.

8. Large hiatal hernia.


[**2149-7-31**] ECHO:
IMPRESSION: no clear-cut evidence of endocarditis or abscess.
The non and right cusps of the aortic valve have focal
thickening and calcification, most likely representing age
related changes. A chronic, healed vegetation is also a
possibility but not likely. Mild focal LV systolic dysfunction.
Diastolic dysfunction. Mild mitral regurgitation. Moderate
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2147-10-3**],
the calcifications on the aortic valve are slightly larger.
Diastolic dysfunction is now evident. There is now pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. The other findings are similar.

[**8-2**] CXR: FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**7-28**], there
is little change.  Enlargement of the cardiac silhouette
persists with mild prominence of interstitial markings that
could reflect elevated pulmonary venous pressure, chronic lung
disease, or both. Left basilar opacity most likely represents a
combination of effusion and atelectasis, though superimposed
infection cannot be excluded. The right lung remains clear.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 87 y/o F h/o CAD, COPD, HTN a/w sepsis in the setting of
UTI with c/f obstructive pyelonephritis, and PNA.  She was
admitted to the ICU [**Date range (1) 34617**].
.
#klebsiella bacteremia/ urosepsis - obstructing left-sided stone
and +U/A.  Has had multidrug resistant urinary pathogens in the
past, including Klebsiella and Proteus sp. that were sensitive
to meropenem and zosyn. Diverticulitis or colitis less likely
based on CT findings.  4/4 bottles GNR returned while in the
[**Hospital Unit Name 153**].  Patient was treated with meropenem for hx ESBL UTIs.  We
also covered for PNA with [**Last Name (un) 2830**], vanco, and azithro given
possible infiltrate. Her antibiotics were narrowed to meropenem
when cultures finalized. Her BC on [**7-29**] was still + GNR, BC from
[**7-31**] and [**8-1**] with no growth to date. She will need to remain on
total 2 week course of antibiotics (Meropenem started [**7-27**] so
should complete course [**8-11**]. A PICC line was placed under IR on
[**2149-8-4**] for administration of IV antibiotics.

#Obstructive ureteral stone: had stone on left urinary system.
Urology attempted  perc IR nephrostomy but were unsuccessful so
she went to the OR on [**8-1**] for cystoscopy and stent placement.
She was on flomax for 4 days per urology recommendations but was
stopped after stent placement.  She has had blood-tinged urine
after procedure. HCT remained stable. This should clear over
next couple days. She will need outpatient urology follow up.
Please see appt scheduled.
.
#Diarrhea - she had several loose stools in the setting of
multiple bowel meds while on her home narcotics. She was not OOB
very much due to her illness, so her pain was much better, not
requiring the opioids. Three c. diff samples were negative.
Bowels stabilized. She then had not had BM for two days and
bowel meds were restarted.

#ARF - b/l Cr 0.8; BUN:Cr ratio c/w pre-renal phy
