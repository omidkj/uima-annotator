Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2123-9-9**] - 1. Aortic valve replacement with a 23-mm [**Doctor Last Name **]
Magna Ease aortic valve bioprosthesis.
2. Coronary artery bypass grafting x2 with left internal mammary
artery to the left anterior descending coronary artery; reverse

History of Present Illness:
76 year old female with known aortic stenosis who presented with
acute onset of chest discomfort and shortness of breath in
[**2123-6-28**]. She was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] and found to now have
severe aortic stenosis with mild left ventricular hypertrophy.
She also developed atrial fibrillation during the her hospital
stay which resolved with a dose of diltiazem. During the
admission, black tarry stools were noted suggesting a
gastrointestinal bleed. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1940**] was consulted and an EGD
showed only mild gastritis with a duodenal ulcer. She was
evaluated by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 914**] who felt and aortic valve replacement
was warranted however wanted her GI issues resolved prior to
proceeding. She returned to the EDon [**2123-8-17**] with shortness of
breath.

Pertinent Results:
ECHO [**2123-9-9**]:
PRE-BYPASS:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. No spontaneous echo contrast
or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium or left
atrial appendage. The left atrial appendage emptying velocity is
depressed (<0.2m/s). No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the
body of the right atrium. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D
or color Doppler. There is moderate symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy.
The left ventricular cavity size is top normal/borderline
dilated. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF>55%). with normal free wall contractility.
There are simple atheroma in the ascending aorta. There are
simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. There are
three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets are
severely thickened/deformed. There is critical aortic valve
stenosis (valve area <0.8cm2). Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is
seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are moderately thickened. Mild to
moderate ([**11-29**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is no
pericardial effusion.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 914**] was notified in person of the results before
surgical incision.

POST_Bypass:
The patient is AV paced on a low dose phenylephrine infusion.
There is a well seated bioprosthetic valve in the aortic
position. The mean gradient across the prosthetic valve is
5mmHg. The remaining valves are unchanged. Biventricular
function is maintained. The aorta remains intact. Overall LVEF
55%.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on 10/ 13/11 for surgical
management of her aortic valve and coronary artery disease. She
was taken to the operating room where she underwent coronary
artery bypass grafting to two vessels and an aortic vlave
replacement using a 23-mm [**Doctor Last Name **] Magna Ease aortic valve
bioprosthesis. Please see operative note for details.
Postoperatively she was taken to the intensive care unit for
monitoring. She was transfused for postoperative anemia. Over
the next several hours, she awoke neurologically intact and was
extubated. On postoperative day one her beta blockade, aspirin,
and a statin were resumed. She was started on amiodarone for
transient atrial fibrillation.  She was then transferred to the
step down unit for further recovery. Her epicardial wires were
removed. After chest tube removal she had bilateral
pneumonthoraces which remained stable on multiple chest
radiographs over several days.  For anemia she was started on
folic acid and iron.  By post-operative day six she was ready
for discharge to [**Hospital 4470**] Rehab.  All follow-up appointments
were advised.
