Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 58 F w/rheumatoid arthritis, HTN transferred fr
OSH after p/w respir distress, intubated, & became septic
w/strep pneumo in blood Cx.

She was found to have ARDS/Pulm  likely from initial CAP. She
had Apache score 26 so started on APC (Zygris) x 96 hrs (started
[**12-10**]). She was continued on propofol and placed on a paralytic
(chose Cisatracurium due to sepsis & multiorgan failure) due to
dyssynchronous breathing w/vent.
.
# ID/Sepsis: HPI c/w CAP; bacteremic/septic at OSH. Micro fr OSH
w/pan-sensitive Strep pneumo so changed Abx to levoflox &
ceftriaxone for double coverage.
.
# HypoTN: likely fr sepsis & dehydration. She was started on
IVF, vasopressin, and titrate levophed along with stress dose
steroids (hydrocort 50 mg IV q6h).

For H/o moderate EtOH consumption ([**2-25**] glasses wine/day): her
thiamine and folate were supplemented.
.
She was found to have ARF: creat was 3.3 @ OSH, now 1.3 after
hydration. Good UOP. Renal U/S @ OSH WNL.
.
She was started on IV protonix (NPO & on steroids) and
pneumoboots. A R fem line (double lumen) & L A-line were placed
[**12-9**] @ OSH. Also 1 PIV.

multiorgan failure.
