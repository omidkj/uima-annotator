surrounding his fall, but awoke at home the next day and was
unable to move his lower extremities. He complained of back pain
and was initially seen at [**Hospital 8641**] Hospital where a CT scan
revealed an L1 burst fracture without obvious spinal cord
damage. He was then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for continued care.

Pertinent Results:
TRAUMA #2 (AP CXR & PELVIS POR   Clip # [**Clip Number (Radiology) 70280**]
IMPRESSION:  Limited study.  Tortuous aorta.  Opacity in the
right apex, which may represent atelectasis, consolidation, or
contusion.  Further assessment by CT scan is recommended if
clinically indicated.
------------

CT T-SPINE W/O CONTRAST   Clip # [**Clip Number (Radiology) 70281**]
IMPRESSION:
1.  L1 burst fracture with posterior retropulsion of a fracture
fragment in the spinal canal.  There is greater than 50% loss of
the spinal canal diameter at this level.
2.  No additional fractures are seen.
3.  Destruction of the posterolateral aspect of the right sixth
rib, with
associated soft tissue density.  Characterization is limited as
this lesion is at the perimeter of the field of view.  While
this may represent scar from prior resection, further evaluation
with CT chest is recommended when the patient's condition
stabilizes.
4.  Status post esophagectomy with gastric pullthrough.
5.  Emphysema.  Pleural calcification along the right lung base
is consistent with prior asbestos exposure.
6.  Left adrenal adenoma.
7.  Atherosclerosis.
8.  Diverticulosis.
--------

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST   Clip # [**Clip Number (Radiology) 70282**]
IMPRESSION:  No evidence for hemorrhage, mass effect, or acute
ischemic
changes.

L-SPINE (AP & LAT)   Clip # [**Clip Number (Radiology) 70283**]
IMPRESSION:
L1 vertebral body compression fracture.  The degree of vertebral
body collapse is unchanged.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] as a trauma transfer from [**Hospital 8641**]
hospital after a fall down stairs resulting in amnesia to the
event and an L1 burst fracture diagnosed at [**Location (un) 8641**]. He was
intubated in the emergency department after sudden onset of
respiratory distress secondary to aspiration following the
administration of Ativan. He was then transferred to the Trauma
SICU on ventilator support.He remained on ventilatory support
secondary to a significant pneumonitis and was treated with
Ceftriaxone IV; this was later changed to Ciprofloxacin, he has
3 more days to complete his course. He was eventually extubated
and then required re-intubation secondary to acute respiratory
distress and declining mental status. On HD # * he was
successfully extubated and transferred to the regular nursing
unit. He has required nasal oxygen at 2-3 L/min with saturations
>93%; his FiO2 requirements have been decreased because of his
history of COPD and should be eventually weaned off. He was
started back on his Albuterol and [**Doctor First Name **] as this was part of
his home medication regimen; Albuterol neb treatments have been
administered intermittently during his hospital stay.

He was evaluated by the Orthopedic Spine service, who determined
that his fracture was nonoperative in nature and he was fitted
for a TLSO brace; this is to be worn at all times. He will
follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1352**], Spine Surgery, in 2 weeks. Neuro
exams off sedation remained stable throughout his stay,
consistently moving all extremities.

His blood pressure was elevated throughout his hospital stay; he
initially required IV Lopressor & Hydralazine. He was later
changed to oral Diltiazem and HCTZ; it is likely he will require
further adjustment of his medications to control his blood
pressure during his rehab stay.

He was also noted to be agitated during his initial
hospitalization and required  Haldol and was also placed on
Ativan per CIWA scale for alcohol withdrawal. He was also
started on a clonidine patch for DT prophylaxis. His mental
status currently is awake, alert, oriented X2, cooperative with
care. He is likely experiencing a delirium related to his fall
and recent respiratory infection (head CT imaging was negative
for any intracranial processed).

He was evaluated by PT & OT and it was recommended that he go to
a short term rehab facility in order to improve function.
