Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 83598**] was admitted on [**2146-11-25**] for Percutaneous
tracheostomy tube, 7-0 per Portex Per-Fit. Bronchoscopy with
aspiration.  He tolerated the procedure transferred to the ICU
for airway and hemodynamic monitoring.  He responded to  fluid
challenges for SBP in the 80-90's.  With aggressive pulmonary
toilet and nebs he titrated to TM Fi02 35% oxygen saturations in
the high 90's.  POD 1 he transferred to the floor in stable
condition.  On [**2146-11-28**] he was taken for Rigid and Flexible
bronchoscopy. Given the complexity of the stenosis as well as
the
patient's underlying co morbidities including his severe
obstructive respiratory disease, he is not amenable for any
further intervention or surgical approach at this time,
therefore, we would recommend keeping the tracheostomy tube
in place for the time being without any further intervention.
On [**2146-11-29**] he was seen by speech and swallow.  At this time he
did not tolerate PMV as indicated by 02 de sats to 87-88%,
manometer pressures increased to +20 cm H20 and symptom ic.  A
bedside swallow study was performed without signs or symptoms of
aspiration with all trialed consistencies.  He was discharged to
home with VNA and on a regular solid thin liquid diet.  He will
follow-up with Speech and Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 5586**] as an outpatient.
