History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 65yo male with PMH significant as listed below
who was transferred from OSH for management of an NSTEMI. Per
patient, he woke up with chest pain. He localized the pain to
the right side of his chest and described it as a pressure in
his chest which remained constant until he presented in the
emergency room at the OSH. Troponins at that time came back at
2.85, 3.68, and then 2.83. He was started on Nitro gtt, Heparin
IV, ASA, Plavix, Atenolol, and Lisinopril with improvement of
his symptoms. EKG did not demonstrate significant changes.
Patient admits to some worsening SOB but denies any fevers,
chills, PND, or orthopnea. On further questioning, patient does
admit to worsening fatigue in regards to his activity over the
past 6-8 weeks. He was stablized and transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**]
for cardiac catheterization.

[**2159-10-30**] Cardiac Cath:
1. Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system
demonstrated 2 vessel coronary artery disease. The LMCA had
60-70%
stenosis. The LAD was patent. The LCX had a 90% stenosis
proximally. The
RCA was occluded proximally and was filled by collaterals. The
left
subclavian artery had a 40-50% stenosis. The left renal artery
had an
80% stenosis at its origin. The right kidney was not visualized.

2. Limited resting hemodynamics were performed. The left sided
filling
pressures were mildly elevated (LVEDP was 17mmHg). The systemic
artery
pressures were within normal range measuring 133/67mmHg. There
was no
significant gradient across the aortic valve upon pull back of
the
catheter from the left ventricle to the ascending aorta.
[**2159-10-31**] Renal Ultrasound:
The left kidney measures 11.7 cm and demonstrates unremarkable
echotexture without evidence of stones, hydronephrosis, or mass.
Appropriate Doppler flow is demonstrated to the left kidney
without evidence of stenosis. The right kidney is small and
atrophic, measuring 8.9 cm without any Doppler flow detected.
This correlates with lack of visualization on angiography study.
The right kidney is otherwise unremarkable without evidence of
stone, hydronephrosis, or mass.
[**2159-10-31**] Carotid Ultrasound:
No significant right ICA stenosis(graded as less than 40%).
Approximately 60-69% left ICA stenosis.
[**2159-10-31**] Echocardiogram:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is an inferobasal left
ventricular aneurysm. There is mild to moderate regional left
ventricular systolic dysfunction with basal inferior and
inferolateral akinesis and hypokinesis of the mid inferior and
inferolateral segments. The basal inferolateral segment is
aneurysmal. Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left
ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve
leaflets are moderately thickened. There is moderate aortic
valve stenosis (area 1.0-1.2cm2), best seen on image 101. Trace
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
structurally normal. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild
(1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The estimated pulmonary
artery systolic pressure is normal. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
[**2159-11-2**] Head CT Scan:
1. No acute intracranial hemorrhage. 2. Chronic right frontal
cortex and right basal ganglia infarcts with associated right
ventricular dilation and right temporal lobe encephalomalacia.
[**2159-11-7**] Chest CT Scan:
1. Left lower lobe nodule, lung carcinoma until proved
otherwise. No good evidence for metastasis, aside from small
liver lesion warranting axial imaging. 2. Small bilateral
pleural and pericardial effusions, more likely related to
cardiac decompensation than malignancy. 3. Aortic and mitral
valvular calcification, hemodynamic significance indeterminate,
but conceivably significant. 4. Atherosclerotic calcification,
including coronary arteries, aorta and splanchnic vessels. 5.
Granulomatous calcifications, peripancreatic, lower mediastinal
lymph nodes in liver.
[**2159-11-9**] PET Scan:
1. Abnormal FDG-avidity in a 12mm left lower lobe pulmonary
nodule
highly concerning for lung carcinoma. 2. Mild to moderate FDG
uptake in the
left adrenal gland. No corresponding nodule identified on CT.
Attention to
this region on follow-up studies is recommended. 3. Bilateral
pleural
effusions and moderate pericardial effusion. 4. Increased
FDG-avidity
throughout the aorto-bifemoral graft.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was admitted under cardiology and underwent cardiac
catheterization which revealed severe multi-vessel coronary
artery disease, left renal artery stenosis and moderate
subclavian stenosis. Based upon the above results, cardiac
surgery was consulted. Prior to surgical intervention, extensive
preoperative evaluation was performed given his multiple medical
issues. Given the complexity, his hospital course will now be
broken down by systems.

CARDIAC: He remained pain free on medical therapy which included
intravenous Heparin. Preoperative echocardiogram
