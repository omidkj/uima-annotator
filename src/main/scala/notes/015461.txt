Preliminary Cardiac Catherization Report:
BRIEF HISTORY:
44 y/o female with CAD s/p MI '[**67**] s/p stent to LAD (unknown if
was BMS
versus DES), also h/o cocaine abuse.  Developed crushing chest
pain
approximately 2 hours after cocaine abuse this morning, to OSH
ER with
anterolateral STEs and reciprocal depressions, transferred for
cardiac
catheterization.

INDICATIONS FOR CATHETERIZATION:
STEMI

PROCEDURE:
Left Heart Catheterization: was performed by percutaneous entry
of the
right femoral artery, using a 5 French right [**Last Name (un) 2699**] catheter,
advanced
to the ascending aorta through a 6 French introducing sheath.
Coronary Angiography: was performed in multiple projections
using a 5
French JL4 and a 5 French JR4 catheter, with manual contrast
injections.
Percutaneous coronary revascularization was performed using
placement of
bare-metal stent(s).
Conscious Sedation:  was provided with appropriate monitoring
performed by
a member of the nursing staff.

**PTCA RESULTS
  LAD

PTCA COMMENTS:     Initial angiography revealed a totally
occluded mid
LAD at the previous placed stent which was filled with thrombus.
We
planned to treat this with thrombectomy, PTCA and stenting. A 6
French
XB LAD 3.5 guide provided good support for the procedure.
Heparin and
Integrillin were used for anticoagulation. A prowater wire
crossed the
lesion with minimal difficulty. thrombectomy of the mid LAD with
an
export catheter re established flow. The lesion was dilated with
a 3.5 x
15 mm NC [**Male First Name (un) **] balloon at 16 ATMS. A 3.5 x 28 mm Vision BMS was

deployed in the mid LAD at 14 ATMS. Final angiography revealed
no
residual stenosis in the stent, no dissection and TIMI III flow.
The
patient left the cath lab with minimal chest pain and in stable
condition.
