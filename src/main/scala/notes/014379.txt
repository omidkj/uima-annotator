SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  Patient is a 24-year-old male,
who presented to [**Hospital1 69**] on
[**2119-12-11**] for a right donor hepatic lobectomy to his
stepfather, [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 52125**].  The patient was taken to the
operating room, and the operation went well without any
complications.  An epidural was placed for adequate pain
control.  Intraoperatively, two JP drains were placed.
Serial hematocrits were drawn, which were stable.  Patient
was extubated.  Initially, it was thought that the patient
would be closely monitored in the Intensive Care Unit for the
first initial postoperative days.  Placed on Unasyn for 48
hours postoperatively.  His fibrinogen level were noted to be
124 and 226.  His INR was 1.7.  He did receive 2 units of
FFP.

On postoperative day one, the patient had a duplex ultrasound
of his liver, which is normal in appearance.

His postoperative course was notable for several episodes of
fever spikes.  This was attributed to atelectasis.  Patient
was pancultured, all of which was negative aside from a
sputum sample, which grew out yeast.  Patient had been placed
on empiric Zosyn during this time, however, by the time of
discharge, he was placed on levofloxacin and fluconazole for
a total of 10 days.

On postoperative day two, the epidural was discontinued.  He
was placed on Morphine and Percocet for pain control,
however, this was eventually changed to Darvocet and
Dilaudid, which provided better pain control.  Patient's diet
was advanced as tolerated slowly.

On postoperative day three, the patient's total bilirubin had
slightly increased.  An ultrasound was checked, which was
normal.  From their end, his liver function tests trended
downward and were within normal limits by the time of
discharge.

Of note, during one of the patient's febrile episodes, a CAT
scan of the abdomen was obtained, which ruled out an
intraabdominal abscess.  By postoperative day 10, it was
thought that the patient was stable for discharge.  He was to
be discharged on a 10 day regimen of levofloxacin and
fluconazole.
