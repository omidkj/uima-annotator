CXR [**1-25**]:

FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**1-24**], there is little
change in the appearance of the tracheal Y-stent. No evidence of
acute pneumonia, vascular congestion, or pleural effusion. There
is some apparent narrowing of the lower cervical airway with
buckling at the clavicular level.
.
EKG: HR 95. Normal axis. Lead 3 QRS flipped from prior, no other
acute changes. Poor R wave progression.

Imaging:
[**1-27**] CXR:

Two views of the chest are compared with the prior study from
[**2114-1-25**]. Heart and mediastinum are within normal limits. There
is minimal atelectasis at the left lung base. There is mild
eventration of the right hemidiaphragm, not appreciably changed
from the prior study. Lungs are grossly clear, otherwise.


Brief Hospital Course:
61 y/o F Asthma, recurrent upper with respiratory tract
infections, moderate-severe tracheobronchomalacia who came to
the hospital for scheduled y-stent placement. Following
procedure patient developed tachypnea and was admitted to the
ICU for monitoring. On [**2114-1-25**] she was called out from the MICU
to the floor after her respiratory status had improved. Her
brief hospital course was notable for:

# Tracheobronchomalacia: On admission patient had an audible
upper airway wheeze. Patient describes upper airway wheeze prior
to trach, however following Y stent procedure worsened thought
to be due to bronchospasm. She received one dose of
racepinephrine in the MICU with improvement and was further
treated with albuterol, ipratropium q6hr, solumedrol 80 mg q8hr
IV with remarkable improvement in the morning. For stent care
mucinex 1,200 mg [**Hospital1 **], benzonatate 100 mg TID prn were continued,
NAC was initially held due to bronchospastic properties but
restarted on the floor.  Patient was on a prednisone taper
starting at 60mg po and tapered by 10mg daily.  She was bronched
again on the day of discharge with findings of patent stent and
mild thick secretions.  Patient was discharged on mucinex 1,200
mg [**Hospital1 **], benzonatate 100 mg TID and NAC and has follow-up
scheduled with IP.

# Tracheobronchitis: She spiked a fever once after stent
placement, and this was thought to be secondary to
tracheobronchitis given normal CXR and clear appearing lungs on
repeat bronch.  Patient was treated with 5 day course of
antibiotics (initially Zosyn and transitioned to [**Hospital1 1378**]).

# Thrush: Seen on bronchoscopy during Y stent placement.  This
was treated with oral fluconazole for a total of 5 days.

# Diabetes: Lantus and sliding scale were continued.  Her sugars
were erratic after steroids but slowly improved with taper.

# Asthma: She was on the above regimen for TBM and restarted on
her Advair.

# Hypercholesterolemia: Continued simvastatin
