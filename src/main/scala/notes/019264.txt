HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 80 year-old
female with a history of COPD, diastolic CHF admitted for
respiratory distress and hypertension. Per the patient's
[**Year (4 digits) 802**] the patient had been increasingly somnolent over the
few days prior to admission possibly due to the initiation of
new anti-anxiety meds Trazodone and Effexor. The patient had
no new complaints. She did, however, have her chronic
abdominal pain for which she has had a thorough workup
revealing nothing. The patient was denying any fever, chills,
cough, dysuria, diarrhea, melena or bright red blood per
rectum. Patient was recently discharged from [**Hospital3 **]
after a COPD exacerbation and she is on a steroid taper as of
admission. Of note, the patient prior to admission was
recently treated with 7 days of antibiotics for a UTI. On the
night of admission the patient was found to be short of
breath at senior living home with O2 sats in the 80s and EMS
was called. On arrival the patient was lying in bed on
nebulizer treatment responsive only to sternal rub with
audible rhonchi and wheezes. She was given Combivent, Lasix
and placed on a nonrebreather and brought to [**Hospital1 18**] Emergency
Department. On arrival the patient was tachypneic to the 30s,
82% on room air and improved to 100% on nonrebreather. Given
her history of CHF she was placed on BiPAP at 15 and 5 and
FIO2 titrated to keep O2 sats below 90s given her COPD. She
was also given Solu-Medrol, Albuterol/Atrovent nebs, Lasix 40
mg IV, aspirin. The patient had a temp of 104.8 rectally and
she was given Zosyn x 1. Patient then noted to be hypotensive
to the 80s and she was given a 500 cc bolus and responded
with systolics in the 100s. She then dropped her blood
pressure again to 73/53 with a heart rate in the 130s and
sepsis protocol was initiated. She had right IJ placed and
Levophed was started. The patient received a total of 2
liters of normal saline in the ED.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  This is an 80 year-old female with a
history of severe COPD, CHF and 2 out of 2 subaortic stenosis
who presented with respiratory distress. So essentially the
patient presented in respiratory distress that was felt to be
the likely combination of CHF exacerbation and COPD flare,
question of pneumonia given bandemia and fever, but no clear
infiltrate was seen on chest x-ray and lungs were clear on
exam. No witnessed aspiration, but the patient's altered
mental status over a few days make aspiration likely. Patient
was continued on Atrovent and Albuterol nebs and Solu-Medrol.
Diuresis was held given the patient's hypotension with plan
on initiating diuresis once the patient's blood pressure was
stable. She was covered for pneumonia with Vanc and Zosyn and
given BiPAP to improve her symptoms of CHF. In terms of her
hypotension and shock the patient's shock differential was
considered to be sepsis versus cardiogenic shock versus renal
insufficiency though likely sepsis given bandemia. Cardiac
enzymes negative x 1. Vanc and Zosyn were given for presumed
pneumonia. During which blood cultures were drawn and
followed. Patient was given aggressive fluids and kept on
pressors that being Levophed. Cord stem test was done and her
response was found to be ineffective. Solu-Medrol was given
for COPD flare. The patient's goal for DVP of 8 to 12 not
greater then 65, grid greater then 30, holding all
hypertension meds. These were the plans for her initial stay
once she was admitted on [**8-11**], however, the patient's
respiratory status continued to decline. She was not
responding to BiPAP. Her CO2 continued to increase as she was
not ventilating well. She was continued to be treated on Solu-
Medrol, antibiotics, albuterol and Atrovent nebs, however, as
her respiratory status began to decline the [**Hospital 228**] health
care proxy her [**Name2 (NI) 802**] [**Name (NI) **] felt that the patient's wishes would
be most consistent with being placed on comfort measures
only. Eventually on [**2122-8-14**] the patient was made CMO by
patient's [**Year (4 digits) 802**] [**Name (NI) **] her health care proxy. She was placed on
a morphine drip and other medical interventions were
withdrawn, the goal being to make the patient as comfortable
as possible.

Following her being placed on CMO, the patient appeared to be
comfortable on her morphine drip. Eventually the patient did
expire at 10:15 p.m. on [**2122-8-14**] of respiratory failure.
