Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 165**]
Chief Complaint:
falls, weakness, headache and dizziness accompanied by n/v and
diarrhea


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2172-6-1**] Cardiac catheterization

[**2172-6-5**] Urgent coronary artery bypass graft x5; left internal
mammary artery to left anterior descending artery and saphenous
vein grafts to posterior descending artery, obtuse marginal,
diagonal 1 and 2. Endoscopic harvesting of the long saphenous
vein.


History of Present Illness:
65 year old famale with a known history of CAD s/p MI, [**2154**] and
angioplasty of RCA lesion, s/p RCA stent [**2156**], s/p [**2158**] angiojet
and stenting of the mid-RCA .5
x 15 mm, Multilink stent, s/p [**2159**] mid RCA using one 3.5mm x
25mm Multilink stent, s/p IMI in [**2170**] at [**Hospital3 **]. She
presented to ED on [**2172-5-20**] with reports of frequent falls,
weakness, headache and dizziness accompanied by nausea, vomiting
and diarrhea for one week. A CT of the head showed cortical
atrophy, old lacunar infarcts bilaterally in the basal ganglia,
small vessel disease, some asymmetry of the periventricular
white matter to the anterior [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the right frontal lobe. She
was started on a course of prophylactic antibiotics for recent
testing which came back negative for C-diff which she has
completed. She was admitted for hydration and developed chest
pain shortly after her admission. She was found to be in atrial
fibrillation and was admitted to the ICU, was started on
amiodarone and converted to SR. She continued to have chest
discomfort and subsequently underwent a stress test that
revealed an inferior defect with inferior infarct. Troponins
were drawn
(beginning [**2172-5-23**] 3.07, 3.47, 2.68, 3.53, 4.07) and patient
ruled in for NSTEMI. An echo done on [**2172-5-23**] showed an EF of
50-55%. After her chest pain was brought under control and she
was subsequently transferred to the telemetry floor and has done
well for the past week. She presently denies chest pain. She was
transferred for further evaluation and for a cardiac
catheterization. She was found to have three vessel disease. She
is now being referred to cardiac surgery for revascularization.

Pertinent Results:
[**2172-6-1**] Cardiac Catheteization
1.  Selective coronary angiography of this right-dominant system

demonstrated severe 3 vessel coronary artery disease.  The LAD
and LCx
had seperate ostia.  The LAD had an 80% mid-vessel lesion prior
to an
aneurysm with collaterals to the RCA and LCx.  The LCx was
occluded
after an OMB.  The RCA was occluded and filled via collaterals
from the
LAD and LCx.
2.  Limited resting hemodynamics revealed severe systemic
systolic
arterial hypertension.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Severe systemic systolic arterial hypertension.
3. CABG evaluation; discontinue Clopidogrel

[**2172-6-2**] Carotid Ultrasound
There is less than 40% stenosis within the internal carotid
arteries bilaterally. No flow within the right vertebral artery

ECHO [**2172-6-5**]
Pre Bypass: The left atrium is mildly dilated. The left atrium
is elongated. The left ventricular cavity size is normal for the
patient's body size. There is mild to moderate regional left
ventricular systolic dysfunction with inferobasal dyskinesis,
inferior mid hypokiensis, Lateral hypokinesis is seen at the
base and mid level. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. LVEF 40%. There are complex (>4mm) atheroma
in the aortic arch. The descending thoracic aorta is mildly
dilated. There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending
thoracic aorta. There are three aortic valve leaflets. The
aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is
borderline moderate aortic valve stenosis (valve area 1.2cm2 by
contiuity and plainemtry ). Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild to
moderate ([**2-2**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.

Post bypass: Patient is on phenylepherine and .02 mcg/kg/min
[**Last Name (LF) 21313**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] and later Apaced. LV function is preserved at
40%. MR is now moderate. AS and AI are unchanged. Aortic
contours are intact. Remaining exam is unchanged. All findings
discussed with surgeons at time of the time of the exam.

Final Report
HISTORY: Short of breath.

CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW: Compared with [**2172-6-10**] and
allowing for
differences in technique, I doubt significant interval change.
Again seen is
evidence of prior sternotomy, with cardiomegaly; left base
opacity, consistent
with left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation; probable
pleural fluid;
upper zone redistribution and mild vascular blurring, consistent
with mild
CHF; and blunting, atelectasis and scarring at the right lung
base. Right IJ
central line tip overlies mid SVC. No pneumothorax detected.

Brief Hospital Course:
Transferred in from outside hospital for cardiac catheterization
after ruling in for non ST elevation myocardial infarction.
Cardiac catheterization revealed significant coronary artery
disease and surgery was consulted.  She underwent preoperative
workup including echocardiogram and carotid ultrasounds.  On [**6-5**]
she was brought to the operating room and underwent coronary
artery bypass graft surgery.  See operative report for further
details.  She received cefazolin and vancomycin for
perioperative antibiotics and was transferred to the intensive
care unit for post operative management.  In the first twenty
four h
