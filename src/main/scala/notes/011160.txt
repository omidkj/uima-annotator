History of Present Illness:
48 year old female with COPD and alcohol abuse, who initially
presented to OSH with altered mental status. She has been having
5 days of fevers, chills, achiness, nausea, and weakness. She
was found at home with altered mental status by her friend and
was brought to OSH [**Name (NI) **]. At the OSH she was found to be in
multiorgan failure, with transaminitis in the 10,000s, INR 3.8,
ammonia 540, creatinine 3.6, and lactate of 13. She was
hypotensive initially to the 60's. Blood pressure was responsive
to 4L of IV fluids with improvement to the 90's. She was given
zosyn, protonix 40mg IV and D50 for hypoglycemia in the 20's.
She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.
.
In the ED, initial vs were: 96.8, 116, 92/41, 21, 100% 2L. Her
blood pressures remained low, as low as in the 70s, despite the

right IJ central line placed. She denied chills, pain, nausea,
vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, chest pain, some shortness of
breath. No
rash, no joint pain. Lactate was slightly improved at 8.1. ED
did not give any further IV fluids because of poor kidney
functions and low urine output despite IV fluid resuscitation at
OSH. Her mental status was noted to be somewhat more improved,
as she was not as lethargic as she had been. Awake and
conversive. She received vancomycin. Hepatology and transplant
surgery evaluated the patient in the ED. Patient was transferred
to the ICU for further workup. Vital signs on transfer were:
