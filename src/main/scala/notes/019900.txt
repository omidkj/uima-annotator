Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
amiodarone / lisinopril

Attending:[**Doctor First Name 3290**]
Chief Complaint:
GI bleed


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Endoscopy
Bronchoscopy
Tracheostomy placement


History of Present Illness:
The patient initially presented to [**Hospital1 **] via ambulance
following being found by his wife to have melena and hematemesis
at home. There, he evidently endorsed generalized weakness, but
denied chest/abdominal pain, fever, or dyspnea. Cordis and 18
gauge placed. Initial lactate was 8 and hematocrit 19. The
patient was resuscitated with 6 units of pRBCs, 2 units of FFP,
and calcium gluconate. As volume was added, the patient was kept
on phenylephrine to keep SBP > 85. The patient was
intubated--difficult intubation with grade 3 view. Octreotide
and pantoprazole drips started. Ceftriaxone also started. A FAST
exam showed fluid in the [**Location (un) **] pouch, which may have been
ascites or blood. Patient had atrial fibrillation on EKG.

In the Emergnecy Department here, the patient underwent trauma
scans, which did not reveal acute problems with head or spine.
The patient did have RLL collapse and secretions in the right
lower lobe bronchus on CT chest. CT abdomen showed attenuation
of liver and edema of gallbladder.
.
On arrival to the MICU, the patient was intubated and sedated.
The Liver service performed endoscopy and saw a substantial
ulcer on posterior wall of duodenum, though the ulcer was not
actively bleeding. No varices.

Past Medical History:
Atrial fibrillation
Hypertension
Alcohol abuse,
Hyperlipidemia.
Hemochromatosis, hereditary.
Polio-induced lower extremity weakness.
Frequent falls, last a few weeks ago caused by loss of balance.
Chronic venous stasis felt to be secondary to venous
insufficiency as opposed to cardiac causes.


Social History:
He is a current smoker.  He has had a problem with alcohol abuse
in the past.  He is currently drinking [**3-17**] drinks a night and
probably more.  He is currently smoking a pack-a-day.  This is
down from 2 packs-per-day in the past.

Family History:
Father and brother had hemachromatosis. Brother and mother have
diabetes.

Endoscopy [**2124-5-11**]:
Duodenum:  Excavated Lesions A single cratered non-bleeding 30
mm ulcer was found in the posterior bulb.
Impression: Granularity and nodularity in the fundus compatible
with portal hypertensive gastropathy
Ulcer in the posterior bulb
Otherwise normal EGD to second part of the duodenum

[**2124-5-14**] CXR:
IMPRESSION: Endotracheal tube at the level of the clavicles, 9.9
cm above the carina, could be advanced ~ 3-5 cm. Well-positioned
nasogastric tube. Right lower lung opacification may represent
collapse. Small right pleural effusion. Asymmetry in
opacification of bilateral upper lobes, right greater than left,
may reflect patient positioning or possibly layering effusion.
See immediately subsequent CT.
.
[**2124-5-14**] CT head:
IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial pathology. Left frontal lobe
encephalomalacia.
.
[**2124-5-14**] CT torso:
IMPRESSION:
1. Endotracheal tube tip is 6 cm from the carina and needs
further
advancement. Nasogastric tube in the proximal stomach.
2. Secretions within the bronchus intermedius, with
near-complete occlusion of the right lower lobe bronchus and
collapse of the right lower lobe and partial collapse of the
right middle lobe.
3. Small amount of simple abdominal and pelvic ascites.
4. Cirrhotic liver. Heterogeneous attenuation of the liver,
underlying focal liver lesions cannot be excluded. Recommended a
non-emergent liver ultrasound or a contrast-enhanced CT for
further evaluation.
5. Distended gallbladder with small amount of sludge. Mild
gallbladder wall edema is likely due to third spacing.
.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST [**5-16**]:
IMPRESSION: Motion-limited study, with no acute intracranial
process. If
clinical concern for infarct is high, MRI is more sensitive.
.
MR HEAD W/O CONTRAST [**5-18**]
FINDINGS: There is no evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage
or mass
effect. In the left frontal lobe, there is an unchanged area of
encephalomalacia, previously described by CT. No diffusion
abnormalities are detected to suggest acute or subacute ischemic
changes. The basal ganglia are notable for high signal intensity
on T1, which is compatible with hepatic encephal
