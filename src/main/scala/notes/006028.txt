Admission Date:  [**2114-11-20**]     Discharge Date:  [**2114-11-21**]

Date of Birth:   [**2094-5-22**]     Sex:  M

Service:  CARDIAC

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 20-year-old
male with recently diagnosed dilated cardiomyopathy of
unknown etiology who presented from clinic with a one week
history of nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and progressive
fatigue and dyspnea.  The patient is status post a recent
hospitalization at [**Hospital6 256**] from
[**10-25**] to [**2114-10-30**] for evaluation and management
of a newly diagnosed dilated cardiomyopathy.  The patient had
previously presented to an outside hospital with a several
month history of progressive fatigue, dyspnea, paroxysmal
nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, shortness of breath, and cough.
The patient was found to have a severely dilated left
ventricle with global hypokinesis, severely depressed left
ventricular systolic function with an ejection fraction of
20% and 4+ mitral regurgitation.  The prior work-up was
unrevealing and included work-up for ischemia, anemia,
thyroid abnormality, toxin alcohol use, rheumatologic
etiologies, as well as infectious etiologies.  Patient was
discharged home on a cardiac regimen including Lisinopril,
Lasix, Toprol XL, and Coumadin.

After discharge, patient reports persistent fatigue with
subacute onsets of nausea, nonbilious, nonbloody vomiting,
epigastric abdominal pain and diarrhea with progressive
fatigue, orthopnea, dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal
dyspnea, and shortness of breath.  The patient reports a
recent persistent cough productive of blood tinged yellow
sputum, and cold sweats, however, denies fever and chills.

The patient is reportedly compliant with his medications, and
was recently decreased on his Lasix dose from 40 to 20 mg po
q.d.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  History of depression with prior suicide attempt.
2.  Idiopathic cardiomyopathy of unknown etiology with
echocardiogram on [**2114-10-26**] demonstrating one severely
dilated left ventricle with ejection fraction of 20% and
severe global left ventricular hypokinesis.
3.  Global right ventricular free wall hypokinesis with
normal right ventricular size.
4.  Moderate left atrial dilatation.
5.  Severe 4+ mitral regurgitation.
6.  Borderline pulmonary hypertension.
7.  Trace aortic regurgitation.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1.  Lasix 20 mg po q.d.
2.  Lisinopril 20 mg po q.d.
3.  Toprol XL 25 mg po q.d.
4.  Coumadin 2.5 mg po q.d.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives with his family and is
currently unemployed.  Patient reports a prior eight pack
year tobacco history, quit in [**2114-10-2**].  Patient also
reports a prior two to three drink per month alcohol history,
quit in [**2114-10-2**].  The patient denies prior or current
intravenous drug use, as well as cocaine use.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Notable for cardiac disease with a father
who had a myocardial infarction at the age of 52.

PHYSICAL EXAM ON ADMISSION:  Temperature 96.3.  Heart rate
112 regular.  Blood pressure 93/55.  Respiratory rate 25.
Oxygen saturation 99% on room air.  In general, patient is a
well-developed, well-nourished young male in no acute
distress who appears fatigued.  Head, eyes, ears, nose and
throat exam:  Normocephalic, atraumatic, anicteric sclera,
pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light and
accommodation, extraocular movements intact bilaterally,
moist mucous membranes, clear oropharynx.  Neck exam:  Supple
with 7 cm of jugular venous distention with no
lymphadenopathy.  Pulmonary exam:  Notable for bibasilar
rales with no wheezes or rhonchi appreciated.  Cardiovascular
exam:  Regular rate and rhythm, [**3-7**] holosystolic murmur at
the apex, radiating to the axilla, S3 and S4 present.
Abdominal exam:  Normal active bowel sounds, tenderness to
palpation of the epigastrium with no guarding or rebound,
soft, no hepatosplenomegaly appreciated, no costovertebral
angle tenderness.  Extremities:  2+ distal pulses bilaterally
with no cyanosis, clubbing or edema.  Skin exam notable for
hypopigmented lesions in the anterior neck bilaterally.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Negative for rash, urinary symptoms, easy
bruising or bleeding.  Positive for decreased appetite with
unintentional approximate five pound weight loss over the
last month.

LABORATORIES AND STUDIES ON ADMISSION:  CBC with a white
blood cell count of 11.2, hematocrit 42.9 with an MCV of 89
and platelet count of 227,000.  Chem-7 with a sodium of 131,
potassium 4.5, chloride 96, bicarbonate 23, BUN 29,
creatinine 1.3.  Coag studies with a PT of 30.9 and an INR of
6.3.  LFTs with an AST of 18, ALT of 35, alkaline phosphatase
46, amylase 24, total bilirubin 0.5.  Chest x-ray on
admission notable for cardiomegaly with vascular engorgement
consistent with congestive heart failure (improved compared
with previous chest x-ray of [**10-26**]) with probable small
bilateral pleural effusions.  Electrocardiogram on admission:
Sinus tachycardia at 109, normal axis, intraventricular
conduction block with normal PR interval, left ventricular
hypertrophy, T wave inversions in the lateral leads, and
biphasic T waves in the inferior leads.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was started on digoxin 0.125 mg
po q.d. for inotropic support and intravenous Lasix 20 mg po
b.i.d. for diuresis.  The patient diuresed approximately 1.5
liters after 40 mg of intravenous Lasix with a dramatic
improvement in his symptoms.  The patient continued to
maintain adequate oxygen saturations on room air.  The
patient developed several episodes of emesis early in the
admission, however, his nausea and vomiting was subsequently
well-controlled with droperidol.  The patient tolerated oral
intake without further nausea or vomiting.  There were no
episodes of diarrhea during the admission.  The patient
remained afebrile without signs of infection.

The patient's Coumadin was discontinued on admission and the
patient subsequently received vitamin K (10 mg subcutaneous,
5 mg po) for an INR of 6.3.  The INR on the morning of
hospital day number two was elevated at 5.4.  Given the
patient's symptomatic improvement and persistent elevated
INR, the Swan-Ganz catheter placement for hemodynamic
monitoring and the potential for milrinone support, was
deemed unnecessary and the patient was subsequently
discharged to home.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Good.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
1.  Lasix 40 mg po q.d.
2.  Digoxin 0.125 mg po q.d.
3.  Lisinopril 10 mg po q.d.
4.  Toprol XL 25 mg po q.d.

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:  The patient was discharged to home
with instructions to follow-up with the [**Hospital 197**] Clinic on
[**2114-11-24**] for blood work and instructions on when to
restart his Coumadin.  The office of Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] will call the
patient for a follow-up appointment one week post discharge.

DIAGNOSES ON DISCHARGE:
1.  Nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy of unknown etiology.
2.  Congestive heart failure exacerbation.
3.  History of depression, status post suicide attempt.
