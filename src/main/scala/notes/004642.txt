Attending:[**Known firstname 922**]
Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea on exertion


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2159-10-18**]: Left mini thoracotomy and placement of epicardial left
ventricular pacing leads x2.  The leads are the following: They
are [**Company 1543**] leads, model number 5071, serial number
[**Serial Number 89470**].  The second 1 is same model number, serial number
[**Serial Number 89471**].
Placement of biventricular pacer defibrillator. The data
on the pacer defibrillator is the following:  It is a
[**Company 1543**] Protecta device, XTCRT-D,  model number D314TRG,
serial number [**Serial Number 89472**].


History of Present Illness:
He underwent ICD placement in [**2154**] for primary prevention. At
that time and attempt to place an LV lead was unsuccessful. He
has never required any ICD shocks. Interrogation in [**Month (only) 216**]
revealed no sustained tachyarrhythmias or device therapies.
Battery voltage was good. Pacing and sensing thresholds and
impedances were stable.  He has been feeling relatively well
since that time but has over the last couple of years noted some
increased shortness of breath with exertion. His Aldactone was
increased without improvement. He is now referred for upgrade to
BiV ICD. His Fidelis lead will be explanted as this has been on
recall.

He denies any LE edema, PND, dizziness, or lightheadedness. He
denies any ICD therapies. He reports moderate shortness of
breath after walking 25 feet on either a flat surface or with
any  incline. Bending over also provokes shortness of breath. He
denies any chest pain.

chamber [**Company 1543**] Virtuoso ICD placed in [**Hospital3 **] in 1/[**2154**].
Failed placement of LV lead at that time. Fidelis lead
placement.
2.  Coronary artery disease status post MI and subsequent
three-vessel CABG, [**2143**].

[**2159-10-21**] CXR:
FINDINGS: A left-sided generator pack with lead tip positioned
in the right atrium and right ventricle appears stable. Two
epicardial pacing leads project over the left contour of the
heart, stable. No pneumothorax is present. The heart remains
moderately enlarged with mild edema. A small left pleural
effusion is present. No consolidations are present.

[**2159-10-18**] Echo:
No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the left atrial
appendage.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed
(LVEF= 20 - 25%). There is akinesis of the inferior wall and
hypokinesis of all other walls.
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
A pacmaker wire is seen in the RV.
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
The aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened.
There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is
seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is
moderate thickening of the mitral valve chordae. Trivial mitral
regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was admitted on [**2159-10-18**] following left mini
thoracotomy and placement of epicardial left ventricular pacing
leads and biventricular pacer defibrillator. He was extubated in
the operating room, and transferred to the CVICU for invasive
monitoring.  On postoperative day one, chest tube was removed
without complication. His device was interrogated and found to
functioning within normal limits.  He maintained stable
hemodynamics and transferred to the step down unit. Chest tubes
and pacing wires were removed per cardiac surgery protocol.  He
was restarted on his home diabetic medications with insulin
sliding scale to maintain blood sugars < 150. Foley initially
remained for low urine output. He was given IV lasix with a good
response. He was also transfused with PRBC to maintain
hematocrit near 30%. On postoperative day three, the foley was
removed and he was voiding small amounts with increased
frequency. On POD 5 he urinated 25 cc and was straight cath'd
for 600 cc and foley was left in place. Flomax was started at
this time. He was seen by a urologist in the past with a history
of history of BPH and Prostate cancer and appointment was made
for follow up appointment with outpatient urologist for next
week.  He is to go home with a Foley catheter leg bag and follow
up next Mon with urologist for voiding trial. He remained on
intravenous Cefazolin per EP recommendations and changed to po
Keflex for a total of 7 day course.  He had a positive UA on
[**2159-10-23**] and was started on Cipro x 3 days with urine culture
results pending at the of discharge. He was transfused 1 unit
RBC for intravascular depletion and rising BUN and creatinine.
His diuretics were discontinued and renal function was stable at
the time of discharge. Physical therapy evaluated him for
strength and mobility.  He was ambulating with minimal
assistance, his incision was healing well and he was tolerating
a full po diet at the time of discharge on POD5.  He was felt
safe for discharge home at this time with all appropriate follow
up appointments made.
