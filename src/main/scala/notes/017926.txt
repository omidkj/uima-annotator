HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 45-year-old
male with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
and obstructive sleep apnea who underwent uvulopalatotectomy
in [**2165**].  This was complicated by hemorrhage and a

Subsequently, he has had multiple dilatations for the
tracheal stenosis.  He is now here for tracheal
reconstruction.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
 1.  Obstructive sleep apnea, status post uvulopalatotectomy.
 2.  Tracheostomy for two weeks in [**2165**].
 3.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
 4.  Hypertension.
 5.  Atrial fibrillation.  The patient has failed several
direct cardioversions.
 6.  Alcohol abuse.
 7.  History of cardiac catheterization in [**2169-6-28**]
with an ejection fraction of 69% and clean coronaries.
 8.  Kidney stones.
 9.  Umbilical hernia.
10.  Gastroesophageal reflux disease.

p.o. q.d., Coumadin (which has been held).

ALLERGIES:  PENICILLIN.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient underwent a rigid bronchoscopy
and direct laryngoscopy, tracheal resection and
reconstruction on [**2170-4-4**].  His intraoperative course was
uneventful.  He was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit
postoperatively in an intubated condition.  He remained
intubated overnight and was in a stable condition.

He was extubated on postoperative day one.  He remained in
atrial fibrillation at this time.  He was started on a
diltiazem drip for the atrial fibrillation with a rate
of 150s.  He underwent a bronchoscopy which showed mild
anastomotic edema and was therefore continued on diuresis.
He remained in the Intensive Care Unit for the next few days
slowly improving with aggressive respiratory treatment.  His
Coumadin was restarted on postoperative day three.  He was
continued on antibiotics of vancomycin and Flagyl which had
been started in the initial postoperative period.

On postoperative day six, he complained of some left lower
extremity pain.  He underwent a lower extremity noninvasive
study which revealed a left lower extremity deep venous
thrombosis.  At this point, he was started on Lovenox as he
was not yet therapeutic on his Coumadin.

On [**2170-4-10**], he underwent another bronchoscopy which
again revealed mucosal edema at the anastomotic site.  In the
next few days in the Intensive Care Unit were essentially
uneventful as he slowly improved, and his respiratory
function was slowly improving.

He was deemed ready for transfer to the regular floor on
postoperative day eight.  He was stable on the floor over the
next few days.  His Coumadin was continued until it reached a
therapeutic level, and at that point the Lovenox was stopped.
He continued to have left leg pain secondary to the deep
venous thrombosis and was treated with a morphine
patient-controlled analgesia.  He had aggressive respiratory
toilet as well at this point.  His clinical condition slowly
improved, and he started ambulating, and his respiratory
function improved as well.

On postoperative day 16 ([**2170-4-20**]), he went back to the
operating room for a bronchoscopy.  At that time, his airways
were clean, and there was no mucosal edema.  He was now ready
for discharge home on Coumadin.
