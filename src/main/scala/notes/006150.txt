on [**2141-7-15**]. Likely COPD exacerbation in the setting of
pneumonia, with a component of acute carbon dioxide retention
from her sedating medications. Unlikely PE with negative LENI
for DVT. Did not appear volume overloaded. Pt was given advair,
tiotropium, albuterol PRN and started on prednisone 60mg Daily
as well as Levaquin.  Pt recieved one dose vancomycin as well.
Pt discharged on prednisone taper and 3 more days levofloxacin.

 dose of lisinopril.

4. Schizoaffective disorder:  Pt continued on outpatient regimen
of carbamazepine, klonapin, loxapine, risperdal, neurontin,
dilantin.
.
5. Tobacco abuse: Pt repeatedly asked to go for a smoke but was

the hospital because you are still being treated for pneunomia

intubation.  Also, given your history of seizure, we did not
complete an evaluation of this problem including EEG. You

leaving at this time.  This was also described with your
healthcare proxy [**Name (NI) 5969**] [**Name (NI) **] at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 79642**] who also
