Imaging:
CXR [**1-4**]
IMPRESSION: Curvilinear opacity in the right lung base, most
likely
represents an area of plate-like atelectasis and less likely
subdiaphragmatic free air within diaphragmatic eventration;
either way, attention on abdominal exam is recommended, and if
clinical concern for surgical abdomen exists, abdominal CT may
be considered. These findings were discussed with, [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 3403**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **],
at 10:36 a.m. on [**2162-1-4**] by [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 449**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 11623**] over the phone.

CXR [**1-4**]:
FINDINGS/ IMPRESSION: There has been interval placement of an
endogastric
tube with the side port projecting over the gastric bubble.
Again is seen a
curvilinear density projecting over the right lower lung with
lucency beneath it, but lung markings are also noted beneath it.
Examination of prior exams shows no diaphragmatic eventration,
and this likely represents an area of atypical atelectasis as
opposed to subdiaphragmatic free air. Otherwise, there has been
no change from prior exam.

EGD [**1-4**]:
Esophagus: Normal esophagus.
Stomach:
Contents:	A large amount of old blood and clots were seen in the
stomach fundus which was thick and difficult to suction through
the endoscope. No active bleeding was seen.
Duodenum: No ulcers seen in the duodenal bulb or second portion
of the duodenum.
Impression:
Blood in the stomach
No ulcers seen in the duodenal bulb or second portion of the
duodenum.
Otherwise normal EGD to second part of the duodenum

EGD [**1-5**]:
Esophagus: Normal esophagus.
Stomach:
Contents:	Old blood that was seen on prior endoscopy was no
longer seen in the stomach likely due to erythromycin which the
patient received prior to the procedure. Excavated Lesions	Two
cratered ulcers with visible vessel and stigmata of recent
bleeding were seen in the cardia of the stomach.  Two endoclips
were successfully applied to one ulcer and one endoclip was
applied to the second ulcer in the cardia for the purpose
