History of Present Illness:
84 yo m hx of CHF EF of 40% who was transfered form rehab due to
worsening of SOB and ARF.  He was recetly admitted from
[**Date range (1) 1424**] and discharge to rehab. He was on lasix 80mg [**Hospital1 **], then
2 days ago, lasix was adjusted to 80mg AM and 40mg PM. Per rehab
his Cr has been trendeding up and his dypsnea has been
worsening. At discharge his Cr was 0.9, then 1.1 and now 2.2
today. UO has been decreased per pt. Wt gains of 2 lbs over last
few days.
.
During his last hopsitalization he was treated for a sternal
wound infection from his CABG on [**6-16**]. On [**7-23**] he had a
debridement and wound closer, with pacer lead removal on [**7-23**].
Epicardial leads were paritally removed. Old PPM remained in
place. He also had a flap closure. Culture of his infeciton
showed MSSA. He developed AIN, so his antibiotics were changed
to vancomycin. He will be on lifelong suppresive therapy after
his regiment of IV therapy. Hardware in the sternum is in place.
His stay was complicated by CHF and ARF from diuresis, later
this improved to a Cr of 0.9 and he was sent to rehab.
.
On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or
red stools. Denies recent fevers, chills or rigors. All of the
other review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
palpitations, syncope or presyncope.
.
In the ED, initial vitals were 96.8 67 128/58 20 94% 3L NC. Pt
was given 250mg IVF over 2 hours. Pt's oxygen was increased to
4L. On transfer temp 97.9 67 120/45 18 96% 4 liters. CXR with
pulm edema. Pt admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 196**].

[**8-31**] CXR:
Studies:
The patient's sternotomy fixators are unchanged in appearance.
The pacemakerleads are unchanged in appearance as well. The
temporary pacemaker leads projecting at the expected location of
the left epicardium are unchanged as well. Left PICC line tip is
obscured by the pacemaker but is most likely not extending
beyond the junction of the axillary vein and the subclavian
vein. Bilateral pleural effusions have slightly improved.
Bibasilar atelectases are unchanged.
.
[**8-31**] LENIs:
IMPRESSION: No evidence of deep vein thrombosis in the right
leg.

[**9-2**] CXR
Portable chest is compared to multiple prior examinations.
Sternal plates,
dual-lead pacer is present. Mild-to-moderate congestive failure,
new from
prior study from [**2103-8-31**]. Right IJ Cordis terminates in the
superior vena cava. No pneumothorax.

ECHO [**9-3**]: EF 30-35%. Suboptimal image quality. Regional left
ventricular systolic dysfunction c/w multivessel CAD. Pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. Severe tricuspid regurgitation.
Mild-moderate mitral regurgitation. Compared with the prior
study (images reviewed) of [**2103-8-14**], regional left ventricular
systolic dysfunction appears to be more extensive, and the
severity of mitral regurgitation, tricuspid regurgitaiton, and
PA systolic pressure are all increased.

[**9-9**] AP-L & Decubitus CXR
The decubitus images in both the left position show moderate
bilateral pleural effusions. The right effusion is minimally
more extensive than the left effusion. With respect to the
sternal fixations, the size of the cardiac silhouette and the
aspect of the lung parenchyma, today's images
provide no new information.

[**9-10**] Tunneled Catheter
IMPRESSION: Uncomplicated placement of a tunneled hemodialysis
catheter
through the right internal jugular venous approach. The line is
ready for
use.

[**9-13**] CXR: Summarized: Effusion on the Left, and decreased/absent
Pleural Effusion on the R.  For a full report, please see

Brief Hospital Course:
84 yoM with hx of CAD s/p recent CABG c/b sternal wound MSSA
infection, CHF and ARF, now presenting with dyspnea and [**Last Name (un) **].
.
Active Issues Upon Discharge:
# [**Last Name (un) **]: Thought to be multifactorial, with the underlying
precipitant AIN secondary to the significant nephrotoxic
antibiotic load the patient received for MSSA treatment;
decreased effective circulatory volume due to CHF decompensation
was likely to also be a contributor to pre-renal
pathophysiology. On presentation, the patient was hyperkalemic,
prompting the administration of Kayexalate, which normalized his
potassium. Following consultation with Infectious Disease and
Nephrology, IV vancomycin was stopped during the 6th of 8 weeks
of treatment; at this time, the patient's vancomycin trough was
supratherapeutic. To optimize volume status and forward flow,
CVVH was started and continued until the patient was net -10L;
the patient's home acetazolamide and furosemide were held.
Hemodialysis was started and patient remained oliguric after two
sessions. As a result, a tunneled hemodialysis catheter was
placed and patient was set up for outpatient hemodialysis.
Of note, he has made minimal urine during his hospital stay.
His largest urine output was 250 cc.  However, the day before
discharge he had no urine output.
