Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 6180**]
Chief Complaint:
Abdominal pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
80M Chinese-speaking with Hepatitis B, hepatoma s/p
Radiofrequency ablation on [**2142-5-3**] who presented to ED with
abdominal pain that patient thought was constipation (no BM x
few days). He was having an annual physical in [**Month (only) 547**] with AFP
checked due to history of hepatitis B. This was elevated to
4527.  He has a long history of hepatitis B as does his wife and
two sons.  [**Name (NI) 6**] ultrasound was done on [**2142-3-21**] that showed a five
centimeter mass in the left hepatic lobe and two masses in the
right hepatic lobe, the largest measuring two centimeters.  No
biopsy was done, but due to the history and the AFP it is
assumed that he has hepatocellular carcinoma. The patient was
seen by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] on [**2142-4-6**] for treatment options. Patient
underwent RFA on [**2142-5-3**]. Patient tolerated this procedure well
initally. Pt returned to [**Location **] c/o abd pain and decreased [**Known firstname **] intake
over 2 weeks PTA. Denied N/V, diarrhea, BRBPR, or respiratory
Sx.
.
In ED, T100.3, WBC 16.5 w/neutrophilia, lactate 5.4, and became
hypotensive to SBP 80s so started on sepsis protocol. Central
line placed, given 9L IVF, started on levophed x3hrs,
vanco/levo/flagyl for suspected GI vs resp source.
.
Pt admitted to MICU for sepsis.

Past Medical History:
-Hepatitis B
-Hepatoma: Dx [**2142-3-21**]; s/p radiofreq ablation [**2142-5-3**]; followed
by [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]
-diabetes mellitus, type 2, Dx last yr, no meds just diet &
exercise
-?glaucoma
-hearing loss


Social History:
He does not smoke or drink.


Family History:
Significant for father with liver cancer who died at age 85.


Physical Exam:
GENERAL:  Mildly ill appearing male, in no acute distress.
VITAL SIGNS:  T: 97.6, BP: 147/62, HR: 73-103, O2sat 96% on 2L
HEENT:  Unremarkable.  Sclerae are anicteric, conjunctivae pink.

Oropharynx is without lesions or erythema. MMM
LYMPHATICS:  No cervical, supraclavicular, axillary, or inguinal
adenopathy.
NECK:  Supple, L IJ in place.
LUNGS:  Bronchial BS on the R, fine rales at L base. No wheezes
or rhonchi.
HEART:  Regular rate and rhythm.  PMI nondisplaced.
ABDOMEN:  Mild distension with normal bowel sounds.  Liver edge
is palpable one centimeter below the right costal margin. No
ascites appreciated.
EXTREMITIES:  Without clubbing, cyanosis, hands and feet with
trace edema. Warm and well perfused.


Pertinent Results:
CXR [**2142-5-20**]:
There is continued mild congestive heart failure with slightly
increased moderate-sized right pleural effusion. There is
continued opacity in both lower lobes indicating atelectasis.
The possibility of superimposed pneumonia cannot be excluded.
The right jugular IV catheter remains in place. No pneumothorax
is identified. There is diffuse dilatation of the bowel,
probably due to ileus. Please correlate clinically.
.
CT abd [**2142-5-18**]:
IMPRESSION:
1) No evidence of hematoma or abscess.
2) Hypodense areas in the liver consistent with post-RF ablation
changes.
3) Focus of enhancement adjacent to the right lobe RF ablations
site, raising concern for persistent hepatoma.
4) Likely bibasilar atelectasis, although the presence of
infection cannot be entirely excluded.
.

RUQ Ultrasound ([**2142-5-18**])
IMPRESSION:
1) Multiple areas of heterogeneous echotexture consistent with
prior RF ablations sites.
2) No intra or extra-hepatic biliary ductal dilatation.
3) Gallstones, with gallbladder wall thickening and edema, which
can be seen in cirrhotic states

ECHO ([**2142-5-22**])
The left atrium is normal in size. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is small.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%). The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mitral
regurgitation is present but cannot be quantified. The tricuspid
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Tricuspid regurgitation is
present but cannot be quantified. There is moderate pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is a trivial/physiologic
pericardial effusion.


Brief Hospital Course:
The patient is an 80 yo chinese-speaking male with hepatitis B
and hepatoma s/p radiofrequency ablation on [**2142-5-3**] who was
admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2142-5-18**] with enterococcus bacteremia and
sepsis admitted to the ICU on the MUST protocol.  He found to
have adreanl insufficency and started on steroids.  He
clinically improved and was sent to a regular medicine floor.
He was doing well until [**2142-5-24**] when he felt increased SOB.  CXR
showed a greated increased right pleural effusion.  He continued
to become tachycardiac and O2 requirements increased from 2L NC
to 100% NRB.  His BP dropped to the 70's and he was intubated
and readmitted to the ICU.  The patient was then intubated.  A
thorocentesis produced 1.8L of bloody fluid from the right lung.
 The hypotension initially required levophed but was eventaully
able to be stabalized with aggressive IV fluids and IV steroids.
 Antibiotics were taped to ampicillin upon culture sensitivites.
 After several days of fluid resusitation, the patient became
increasingly fluid overloaded.  He was diuresed with IV lasix
for several days as his BP would tolerate.  On [**2142-6-1**] the
patient began to be weaned off sedation and was able to breath
spontaneously over the ventilatior.  He was successfully
switched to CPAP and later that day successfully ventilated.
