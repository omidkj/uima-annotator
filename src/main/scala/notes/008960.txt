Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2817**]
Chief Complaint:
PNA, aortic stenosis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2182-4-30**] Intubation at other hospital
[**2182-5-8**] Bronchoscopy at other hospital
[**2182-5-14**] Tracheostomy
[**2182-5-14**] PEG tube placement


History of Present Illness:
75F h/o COPD, severe AS, admitted [**4-29**] to OSH with 1 week of
weakness, shortness of breath, and decreased oral intake. She
was ultimately found to have RLL PNA, GPC bacteremia, and CHF,
resulting in transfer to the ICU and subsequent intubation. She
is transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] because of difficulty extubating.
.
As above, she presented on [**4-29**], VS= 98.0 138/70 78 18. CXR
revealed RLL consolidation and bilateral pleural effusions. WBC
17.4, HGB 11.8, Na 121, Cre 0.8. She was admited to the medical
floor for treatment of PNA and hyponatremia, with
CTX/azithromycin, and gentle IVF hydration.
.
On [**4-30**], pt desaturated to the the 80s, with BP 180-200, she was
placed on BiPaP and transferred to the ICU and ultimately
intubated. Blood cultures from [**4-29**] returned positive for GPCs x2
sets (strep salivaria), for which ID consult obtained, and
patient started on vancomycin 1g Q12H, azithromycin stopped. Per
discharge summary, she was intermittently diuresed in the ICU
with lasix.
.
Cardiology consult was obtained given concern for CHF on CXR and
known severe aortic stenosis. Recs were to rule out endocarditis
with TTE, and obtain renal and pulmonary consults. TTE on [**4-30**]
was obtained which revealed normal LV function and critical AS
(0.2cm). Repeat TTE on [**5-7**] raised concern for mitral valve
vegetation. After discussion of possible valvular intervention,
pt was referred to [**Hospital1 18**] given her previous valvular surgery
here.
.
On [**5-8**] pt was noted to have moderate amounts of blood from her
ET tube. An emergent bronchoscopy was performed, while pt was on
coumadin and lovenox, which revealed bleeding from the inferior
segment of the lingula on teh left, into which 10mL of
epinephrine were injectied in addtion to cautery. An area of
exposd vessel was also noted at the carina beween the anterior
an lateral subsegement of the LLL was also cauterized. CXR at
that time revealed an effusion on teh right side which was
drained via thoracentesis, removing 800cc of yellow fluid.
.
A urology consult was obtained given hydronephrosis [**2182-4-30**] (R
kidney 10.9, left 10.2, with mild hydronephrosis), which
recommended monitoring the patients creatinien and consideration
of CT ABD/PEVLIS.
.
Pt was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] today given difficulty weaning from
the ventilator, concern for contribution from critical AS, and
consideration of valve surgery.
.
Upon arrival to the MICU, pt is off all sedation, and pulling at
tube. She was given propofol to facilitate sedation.

[**2182-5-9**] ECG: Sinus rhythm with frequent atrial premature beats
and occasional atrial bigeminy. Left anterior fascicular block.
Possible prior anteroseptal myocardial infarction. Compared to
the previous tracing of [**2178-10-28**] there is frequent atrial
ectopy. The other findings are generally similar.
.
[**2182-5-9**] CXR:
1. ET tube in standard position.
2. Findings consistent with pulmonary edema and emphysema and
persistent
right pleural effusion.

[**2182-5-10**] Abd U/S:
1. Gallbladder sludge with wall thickening, which may be
secondary to the patient's low albumin. No cholelithiasis. No
specific sign of cholecystitis.
2. Urothelial thickening involving the renal pelves bilaterally,
right
greater than left, and given the bilateral findings, this may
represent
chronic urinary tract infections, particularly fungal. Clinical
correlation is recommended. Also increased echogenicity of the
kidneys bilaterally, likely reflecting chronic medical renal
disease.
3. Subtle diffuse hepatic nodularity, suggesting the possibility
of chronic liver disease.
4. Bilateral pleural effusions and minimal ascites.
.
[**2182-5-10**] TTE:
The left atrium is normal in size. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is
unusually small. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
normal (LVEF 70%). The right ventricular cavity is dilated with
focal hypokinesis of the apical free wall. The aortic valve
leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. The mitral valve
leaflets are moderately thickened. There is a large globular
mass on the posterior mitral valve leaflet. There is severe
mitral annular calcification. There is moderate thickening of
the mitral valve chordae. There is mild functional mitral
stenosis due to mitral annular calcification. Moderate (2+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the
severity of mitral regurgitation may be significantly
UNDERestimated.] The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. The supporting structures of the tricuspid valve are
thickened/fibrotic. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion. Compared with
the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2178-10-20**], the left atrial myxoma is no longer present. There is now
a mass on the posterior mitral leaflet consistent with
endocarditis.
.
[**2182-5-10**] CT CHEST:
Gravity-dependent consolidative opacities bilaterally with high
attenuation material in the left base suggestive of hemorrhage.
This is consistent with combination of atelectasis, hemorrhage,
and infection.

[**2182-5-17**] MRI BRAIN:
There are multiple small areas of acute infarct seen in both
supra- and infratentorial regions. In both cerebral hemispheres,
multiple small areas of infarcts are seen in the frontal,
parietal and occipital lobes as well as in the periventricular
region and both thalami. In the posterior fossa in both
cerebellar hemispheres, left middle cerebellar peduncle and
right side of the pons demonstrate foci of acute infarct seen.
There is a small area of blood product seen in the left parietal
subcortical region as seen on the previous CT. There is no
midline shift or hydrocephalus. Mild brain atrophy is seen.
Suprasellar and craniocervical regions are normal on the
sagittal images. Fluid is seen in both mastoid air cells which
