Chief Complaint:
transfer from ortho s/p embolic stroke

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
R femur fracture repair

History of Present Illness:
58 yo with DM, CAD, HTN s/p mechanical fall admitted [**2158-1-19**] to
ortho for distal right femoral fracture, went for ORIF today
with unremarkable intraop course until ~1hr into the procedure
when she suddendly developed acute onset of hypotension and
hypoxia, intraop TEE revealed dilated RV/RA and impaired wall
motion and large ASD, concerning for acute embolic events.  Pulm
angiogram by IR showed no clear PE but ?decreased flow to right
pulm artery. IR did inject 50mg TPA into pulm artery and started
her on NO for pulm hypertension. Venogram showed DVT but IR did
put in a temp IVC filter. Initial PA mean presssure was around
28 but later improved to around 17.  EKG with more right-ish
axis but otherwise no evidence of acute ST/T changes.

Brief Hospital Course:
58 yo with DM/CAD admitted to MICU with acute intraop
hypotension and hypoxia, due to fat embolization.  She was given
tPA and started on IV heparin in the OR by IR and had an IVC
filter placed as well.  Her hemodynamics improved quickly and
she only required transient pressor support.
.
1. Ortho: Pt was admitted to the hospital and was taken to the
OR after being cleared by medicine for ORIF.  Her post-op course
was complicated hypoxia and hypotension and she was transferred
to the MICU.
.
2. Neuro: Pt was transferred to the MICU post-op after becoming
acutely hypotensive and hypoxic.  An MRI/MRA revealed numerous
embolic strokes among different teritories including cerebrum,
cerebellum and brain stem.  An IVC filter was placed.  It was
then determined that the embolic strokes were [**1-18**] fat emboli via
a patent foramen ovale.  On [**2-5**], it was noted that the pt had
increased right-sided weakness and a head CT was done which
revealed hemorrhagic transformation of infarcts within left
occipital, temporal, parietal and right parietal. Pt was
evaluated by neurosurgery and neurology who recommended
conservative management. Anticoagulants were stopped.  In
addition, an EEG revealed non-convulsive status. She was loaded
on dilantin and depakote.  After depakote load, she was found to
still have a very active EEG so she was started on propofol
until she broke out of status.  Over the next several days, pt
was weaned off sedation and it was determined by hourly EEGs
that she was no longer having any seizure activity.  It was
extremely difficult to obtain therapeutic levels of dilantin and
depakote. Patient has required continued level checks with
titration to maintain theraputic levels. She has regained no
function during her MICU stay.

3. Respiratory failure: Pt was transferred to the MICU [**1-18**]
hypoxia.  She was later found to have a PE [**1-18**] fat emboli.
During her stay in the MICU, she would not tolerate a wean off
the vent and she was eventually trached due to her thick resp
secretions and poor mental status.  She was then weaned off the
vent onto trach mask.  She occasionally became hypoxic on the
floor [**1-18**] mucous plugging and would require brief stays in the
MICU for mechanical ventilation. During her MICU re-admission
for respiratory distress requiring vent, she was weened several
times but could not tolerate trach blow by for longer than 24
hours. Additionaly, she was requiring frequent suctioning.
Ultimately, it was determined that she would require long term
weening in a rehab facility.

4. Hypotension: Pt had multiple episodes of hypotension
requiring pressors during her hospital stay.  Several episodes
were due to mucous plugging and resolved after a rest on the
ventilator.  Other episodes of hypotension were due to sepsis
and as her infection was treated, she was weaned off pressors
and her MAPs remained in the 70s. Several days prior to
discharge, her pressures were stable and required no interval
interventions.

5. FEVER: Pt completed a 8 day course of cefepime for ventilator
associated pneumonia.  Her blood culture on [**1-29**] and [**1-30**]
revealed coag-neg staph resistant to oxacillin so her right IJ
was discontinued and she was started on vancomycin for
line-assoc bacteremia.  A TEE was negative for endocarditis.
During one of her re-admissions to the MICU when the pt was
hypotensive and febrile, cultures were drawn and she was found
to have klebsiella and pseudomonas growing in her sputum so she
was started on zosyn.  Blood cx were negative.  The pseudomonas
later became resistant to zosyn so the pt's antibiotics were
changed to imipenem.  After two days of imipenem, she was found
to have c diff and imipenem was discontinued with meropenem
being resumed for the multiresistant pseudomonas and klebselia.
She will complete a 14 day course of Flagyl and meropenem.
Patient additionaly grew out resistant pseudomonas from a PEG
swab site. Gent was added after this second strain of
pseudomonas grew out with multiple resistant strains. She will
complete a 5 day course of gentamicin. Stop dates have been
provided on her medication d/c information. Patient remained
afebrile x5 days prior to discharge with WBC trending down.

6. CAD: In OR pt became acutely hypotensive and hypoxic. TEE
showed RV enlargement with hypokinesis with PASP high 40s with
right to left shunting across ASD. IR did pulmonary angiogram
which showed slow flow in RPA, but no definite thrombus.  She
was given TPA and had an IVC filter placed, despite no clear DVT
on Venogram.
On admission to the ICU, she was hypotensive requiring levophed.
 Cardiac enzymes were sent and found to be positive (MBI 7.5).
Echo showed RV dilation with hypokinesis - bowing into left
heart.  LV with possible inferior wall motion abnormalitiy.
These findings were likely consistent with fat embolus causing
acute pulmonary HTN with RV pressure overload. She has remained
on ASA prophylactically during her MICU stay.

7. Renal Failure: Pt's baseline creatinine is approxi
