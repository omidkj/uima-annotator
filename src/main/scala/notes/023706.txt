Laboratories: Labs sent from nursing home were remarkable for
WBC 32.7, Hct 35, Plts 224; BUN 29/Cr 0.9; [**Hospital1 18**] ED labs notable
for WBC 26, electrolytes wnl, BNP 7220. UA 21-50 wbc, mod
bacteria. See below for rest of labs.

ECG: Sinus rhythm 77 with PACs, incomplete LBBB. No prior for
comparison.

Imaging:
CT torso with contrast ([**2-1**]):
1. No central pulmonary embolus.
2. Bilateral lower lobe opacities, with dense consolidation
opacification of the posterior basal segment of the left lower
lobe, concerning for pneumonia.
3. Pulmonary edema with effusions.
4. Severe vascular calcifications.
5. 2.2 cm right groin pseudoaneurysm at the confluence of the
aorto-femoral graft and native artery.
6. Indeterminant 4.4 cm left adrenal mass. This can be further
evaluated
with an adrenal protocol CT on a non-emergent basis.
7. Mediastinal lymphadenopathy.

RUE US ([**2-1**]): no evidence of right upper extremity DVT


Brief Hospital Course:
78F with h/o stroke with R hemiparesis and aphasia presents with
hypoxia, volume overload/CHF, and hypotension.

# Sepsis - On admission she met SIRS criteria with T101, WBC 26,
hypoxia, and hypotension. She was started on pressors in the ED
and quickly weaned off pressor support the next morning. The
suspected source was aspiration PNA given her CT evidence of
bilateral opacities.  She was treated with vanc and zosyn (day 1
= [**2-1**]); flagyl was initially started for empiric C diff
coverage however given the lack of diarrhea of findings of
colitis on CT abdomen it was stopped.

She will continue Vanc and Zosyn for nursing home acquired pna
for a 10 day course.  Blood and urine cultures have been NGTD.


A speech and swallow evaluation was performed given concern for
aspiration as the source of the patient's sepsis.  The bedside
and videoswallow did not reveal any evidence of aspiration or
silent aspiration.  The patient may aspirate her gastric
contents when supine but changing her diet will not decrease the
occurrence of this.  Strict aspiration precautions when patient
eating.

# CHF systolic , acute: EF 45%.  CT chest showed pulmonary edema
with effusion.  Patient's ace-I restarted and the patient was
diuresed with resumption of her home lasix dosage on discharge.

# CAD s/p CABG: EKG without signs of active ischemia, two sets
of enzymes negative.  She was continued on ASA, Plavix, statin.
Her metoprolol was initally held given her hypotension and was
restarted once her SBPs were stable.

# stroke with aphasia: The patient presented with bilateral
lower lobe pna suspicious for aspiration.  Speech and swallow
exam ordered to assess aspiration risk.  She was continued on
her outpatient regimen of baclofen, oxybutynin, lidoderm,
neurontin for chronic pain on the hemiparetic R side.

# depression: She was continued on her outpatient regimen of
paroxetine and buspirone.

# ? RIJ/RSC DVT: US showed no evidence of DVT

#  Pseudoaneurysm: 2.2 cm right groin pseudoaneurysm was seen on
CT at the confluence of the aorto- femoral graft and native
artery.
-Patient will likely need outpatient vascular surgery evaluation
pending family's goals of care. This finding was discussed with
the patient, her family and their nurse practitioner.

# Incidental adrenal nodule: 4.4 cm left adrenal mass was noted
on CT on admission.
Previously known finding that has been thorughly evaluated
previously.  Family, patient and nurse practitioner aware of
findings.  No desire for further inpatient evaluation per
family.
