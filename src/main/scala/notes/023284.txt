Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1167**]
Chief Complaint:
CHF exacerbation

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
This is a 24-year-old gentleman with PMH significant for
non-ischemic cardiomyopathy, diagnosed 2 years ago, (EF 20-25%)
s/p AICD placement, morbid obesity and sleep apnea, recently
discharged from [**Hospital1 18**] after treatment for multi-focal pneumonia
who presents with shortness of breath and edema.
.
During his recent hospitalization [**9-27**] to [**9-30**], he was treated
for PNA in the ICU with ceftriaxone and azithromycin. He did not
require intubation and there was not concern for sepsis. He was
discharged on Azithromycin for one more day and Cefpodoxime that
is supposed to be stopped [**10-8**]. Upon discharge, Digoxin and
Torsemide were held in the setting of renal failure.
.
For the last 2 days has had dyspnea on minimal exertion.  Feels
like he's very edematous, lower extremity edema, "feels swollen
all over."  No fever, no chills, and his cough that he had prior
to last hospitalization has resolved. No changes in bowel
habits. He denies chest pain but does say that he has had some
chest tightness. He also has orthopnea (cannot tolerate lying
down)--has to sit up in chair, which prevents his sleeping.  He
says that he has not urinated very much in the last few days. He
denies changes in his diet recently. Weight today 391 lbs. At
baseline, the patient walks around while working at [**Hospital1 778**], does
light exercise in the gym, can lie flat to sleep. He says that
he eats a lot of carbs in his diet but also vegetables and
doesnt eat junk food.
.
In the ED, vitals were Temp:98.6 HR:103 BP:165/121 Resp:28
O(2)Sat:99. The patient had "coolish" extremities. Tmax in ED
100.3.  Lactate 2.8. CXR showed residual right-sided PNA and
some vascular congestion, but not overt pulmonary edema. He weas
given 80 IV Lasix and did not put out much urine to that. Lasix
gtt was not started given low BPS.  Blood pressure then dropped
to 60s/40s but asymptomatic, now back to SBPs in 90s without
intervention. Received 1 dose of levoquin.  Access: 1 20gauge
IV.


Past Medical History:
1. Presumed Idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy
- diagnosed [**11-27**] when he presented to [**Hospital1 18**] with cough, fever,
and increasing SOB. Chest CT showed bilateral lung infiltrates
and enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes consistent with multifocal
pneumonia, and echocardiography showed moderate to severe
global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 25-30%), with
normal valve function, and no pericardial effusion. Lab work
for RSV was positive, while HIV, influenza, EBV, CMV, Lyme and
multiple blood cultures were unremarkable.
- last ECHO on [**2193-3-13**] showed severely dilated LV cavity with
severe global hypokinesis (LVEF = 20-25%).
2. Childhood asthma
3. Morbid obesity
4. Sleep apnea - on CPAP but has not been using it
5. Moderate pulmonary hypertension
6. Fatty Liver by CT. Obese and hx of EtOH. INR 1.4-1.7 since
[**5-29**]; Bili 1.7; HCV neg; HBV immune.

Social History:
Works as security guard at [**Hospital1 778**], as well as wrestling coach.
Lives at home with his parents and brother [**Name (NI) 3535**]. Drinks ETOH
occasionally. Denies tobacco. No current illicit drug use though
he previously used cocaine.


Family History:
Father and mother both have diabetes. Four healthy sisters. [**Name (NI) **]
family history of SCD or cadiomyopathy.


Physical Exam:
General: Alert, oriented, diaphoretic
HEENT: Sclera anicteric, MMM, oropharynx clear, PERRLA
Neck: JVP unable to localize given obese neck
Lungs: Clear to auscultation bilaterally, no wheezes, rales,
ronchi
CV: s1s2 heard, heart sounds distant, no murmurs appreciated
Abdomen: Obese, NTND, trace ankle edema, non-pitting. No
abdominial bruits.
Extrem: No stasis dermatitis.  1+pitting ankle edema. Dorsalis
pedis 1+ bilaterally.

Interval change in exam: Throughout period of diuresis,
patient's ankle and abdomenal edema drasticly decreased.

Pertinent Results:
STUDIES:

[**2193-10-4**] ECHO
The left atrium is markedly dilated. The right atrium is
markedly dilated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is severely dilated.
There is severe global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF =
10-15%). No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
The right ventricular cavity is moderately dilated with moderate
global free wall hypokinesis. There is no aortic valve stenosis.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. The
pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Massively dilated left ventricle with severe global
systolic dysfunction. Mild aortic and mitral regurgitation.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2193-3-13**],
left ventricle has further dilated and systolic function appears
to have slightly deteriorated.

[**2193-10-10**] ECHO
The left atrium is normal in size. The left ventricular cavity
is severely dilated. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a
focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. There is
severe global hypokinesis (LVEF= <20 %). No masses or thrombi
are seen in the left ventricle. Right ventricular chamber size
is mildly dilated with moderate global free wall hypokinesis.
The aortic valve is not well seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
structurally normal. Mitral regurgitation is present but cannot
be quantified. There is a very small pericardial effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2193-10-4**],
left ventricular systolic function may be minimally improved

Brief Hospital Course:
CHF Exacerbation: Mr. [**Known lastname 32362**] is a 24 yo man with non-ischemic
cardiomyopathy who presented in CHF exacerbation with extensive
edema after his torsemide was held on discharge during a prior
admission for pneumonia. He was diuresed with a lasix drip,
milrinone, acetazolamide, eplerenone, metolazone. His admission
weight was 391 lbs and his discharge weight was 330 pounds. He
was agressively repleted with potassium during his stay given
his diuresis. Upon discharge, his shortness of breath had
improved and his edema had also much improved. He was discharged
on torsemide 60mg daily. He will followup with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 437**] in a
few days. He will also continue potassium supplements 40mEQ [**Hospital1 **]
until he sees Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 437**]. He was encouraged to follow up with
Nutrition with the goal of losing weight to further optimize his
heart function. He should review this at his next PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) **].
.
#Prior PNA: Throughout hospitalization, pt remained afebrile and
asymptomatic. Had persistent leukocytosis (WBC [**11-5**]) despite
negative workup. Urine and blood cx negative.
.
#Transaminitis: Had elevated LFTs (ALT 900s, [**Female First Name (un) **] 3.4) but
asymptomatic with no abdominal pain. Likely secondary to liver
congestion and decreased forward flow. Trended down during
hospitalization after aggressive diuresis.
.
#Coagulopathy: INR 1.8 on admission and decreased to 1.2 by day
of discharge. Likely secondary to hepatic congestion.
