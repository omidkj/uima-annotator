Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1148**]
Chief Complaint:
Melena and coffee ground emesis.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Revision of TIPS
Embolization of duodenal varix
EGD
Intubated
Bronchoscopy

History of Present Illness:
46 year old female with a history of alcohol and HCV cirrhosis,
esophageal and duodenal varices, multiple GI bleeds, status post
TIPS.  Recently admitted on [**8-9**] with hematemesis and
melena.  Per report, on day of admission [**8-25**], the patient had
originally experienced episodes of vomiting "coffee ground"
material, which was preceded by abdominal pain. When found by
EMS, she was in bed dry heaving, having dark color diarrhea, and
only oriented to name. In ED, she was intubated for airway
protection and transferred to the ICU. She underwent EGD, which
revealed a large duodenal varix as culprit, that was unable to
be banded or injected. She then underwent embolization, followed
by TIPS revision. Her Hct was stable afterwards. She was also
noted to be difficult to wean off the ventilator, and was noted
on bronchoscopy to have a pneumonia that was likely secondary to
aspiration. She was treated for 7 days with vancomycin and
aztreonam.  When she was transfered to CC-7 from the MICU on
[**9-3**] she was being actively diuresed.

STUDIES:
ENDOSCOPY [**8-26**]: Varices at the lower third of the esophagus.
Congestion and erythema in the antrum; stomach body and fundus
compatible with gastroapathy. Erythema and friability in the
first part of the duodenum compatible with duodenitis. Varices
at the second part of the duodenum.
.
HEAD CT [**8-26**]: No evidence of acute intracranial process.
Widespread sinus opacification.  However, this could be seen in
intubation.  Subcutaneous left parietal nodule, unchanged.  It
measures 13 mm in diameter and may represent a sebaceous cyst.
.
BRONCHOSCOPY [**8-28**]: INDICATION:  Respiratory failure with
left-sided atelectasis,hypoxemia, lack of chest rise on the
left.  NOTED:  The
airways were examined to the subsegmental level bilaterally
and there were no endobronchial lesions seen. The right side
was within normal limits, however, the left side was
completely obstructed by tenacious and copious thick
secretions which were therapeutically aspirated. Subsequent
to the bronchoscopy, the airways on the left side were patent
and the patient had good chest rise on the left.


Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 46 year old female with alcohol and questionable HCV
cirrhosis and portal hypertension, admitted for variceal bleed
and status post TIPS revision and varix embolization.  Stable
hematocrit over the past several days.
.
1) GI Bleed:
-Emergent EGD on [**8-26**] revealed grade 1 varices in distal [**12-12**] of
esophagus that were not bleeding; portal gastropathy was noted.
The protruding second part of the duodenum showed stigmata of
recent bleed.  The varix was smaller than on prior EGD,
consistent with recent embolization.  No bleeding was visualized
so no intervention was performed.  Despite no evidence of bleed,
hematocrit fell from 31 on [**8-23**] to 21 on [**8-25**].  Patient was
continued on octreotide gtt and protonix gtt; she also received
6 units packed RBCs and 6 units FFP.
- On [**6-18**] the patient's pre-TIPS gradient was 13mmHg and
post-TIPS gradient was 9mmHg. On [**8-28**] patient underwent TIPS
revision and repeat embolization.  If patient rebleeds, then
injection of glue (experimental) will be considered.  Once
transferred from the MICU, she continued proton pump inhibitor,
[**Hospital1 **].  Her hematocrit stayed stable in high 20's (nadir was 20-21
during acute GI bleed).
.
2) End stage liver disease:
-Etiology likely from alcoholic or HCV cirrhosis.  Patient was
followed by GI
