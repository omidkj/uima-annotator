History of Present Illness:
HPI: 20 year old female with MPGN s/p renal transplant ([**7-13**])
and recurrent MPGN who was recently admitted for renal failure
as well as hypertensive emergency who re-presents with
hypertensive emergency.
.
She initially presented from [**Hospital1 336**] to [**Hospital1 18**] transfer in [**1-15**] for
ARF. She also developed severe HTN to the 200s resulting in
adjustment of her BP medications. She was also found to have
hemolytic anemia thought [**1-9**] to her malignant HTN according the
heme/onc. She was treated supportively with PRBCs as well as
plasmapheresis for her MPGN. She also went for embolization of
an AVF in her transplant kidney which occurred as a result of
her transplant. Though this resulted in an increased Cr, HD was
not required and she was discharged with close follow up.
However, the patient returned one day later when she was found
to have SBPs in the 200s by her PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) **] was re-admitted to the
ICU for BP monitoring and further titration. She was also found
to have HTNive retinopathy as well. The decision was made during
that admission to start HD which she tolerated well. She did
require 1 unit PRBCs for persistent anemia thought [**1-9**]
hemolysis.
.
She was then doing well on HD until the day prior to this
admission. On sunday she developed coarse cough we no real
productive sputum. She also felt generally unwell but denied
overt fever, ST, HA, CP, abd pain, myalgias. Her coughing spells
did cause her to have nausea and she vomited at home. She went
in to see her PCP on monday who recorded a T 100.8. Rapid strep
and flu were negative. CXR was also taken and there was ? of
small infiltrate. No antibiotics were given. She then went for a
full HD session, continued to feel unwell, and presented to the
ED. Of note, her family has been sick with the cold and her
mother was diagnosed with the flu. She reports good adherence to
her medications, but did not use her clonidine patch this
weekend and is unsure if her vomitting prevented good digestion
of her pills.
.
In the ED, T 99.2, HR 92, BP 155/108, RR 16, 100%RA. CXR was
done. She was given Levaquin, Vanco. She was noted to have T
99.6, mild HA and nausea. Pt noted to have BP 189/102 at 0515.
She was given 25mg Hydralazine. At 0640 BP 210/129. Given Cozaar
50mg, Captopril 25mg, Labetolol 20mg IV. BP did not improve and
was started on Labetolol gtt ([**1-11**]). She was started on Nipride
at 1015 (3mcg/hr). At 1030 BPs improved to 140-180/74-108.
.
On arrival to the ICU, she states that she feels about the same.
Her eyes are closed. She denies CP, vision changes, HA.

[**6-/2178**], pt presented with uncontrolled BP requiring ICU
admission for Isradipine drip. Repeat biopsy showed a type 1
MPGN. Negative HepC,HepB,[**Doctor First Name **], and renal U/S from NMEC showed
stable AVF. Her creatinine peaked to 4's and she was started on
steroids, prograf and cellcept. In [**1-/2179**], she required 3
sessions of HD through a right upper chest catheter. Creatinine
slowly recovered to 3.2. Plasmapheresis was then initiated with
plan to then treat with Rituximab. She only underwent 3 sessions
