Brief Hospital Course:
1) Respiratory Distress: When the patient arrived on the floor
she had oxygenation saturation in the high 90s on room air. We
stopped her clindamycin and azithromycin after reviewing her CXR
and feeling that pneumonia was not likely. Attempts were made to
rule out flu by the MICU team, but unable to obtain a sample
from the patient. We continued to wean her off her Ipratropium
and Albuterol nebs. The day prior to discharge the patient did
not need any nebulizer treatments. We had also started a
prednisone taper and the patient was tolerating that well. As an
outpatient she was to use the following prednisone taper:
Prednisone 40mg for 3 days [**8-6**] - [**8-8**]
Prednisone 20mg for 4 days [**8-9**] - [**8-12**]
Prednisone 10mg for 4 days [**8-13**] - [**8-16**]
Prednisone 5mg for 4 days [**8-17**] - [**8-20**]
The patient also had a follow up appointment with her PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) **]
the day of discharge she stated that she was breathing well and
she was anxious to go home. We also recommended that she
continue using her home bronchodilator treatments.
.
2)History of seizures: The patient's Phenytoin level was sub
therapeutic on admission.  She was started on her home dose and
her phenytoin level was therapeutic on discharge.
.
3)Psychiatric history: The patient's last diagnosis in recent
OMR note: Adjustment Disorder with Mixed Emotional Features &
Personality Disorder NOS. We continued her on her home regimen
of Citalopram and Quetiapine.
.
4) Chest Pain: After continuous nebulizer treatments and
difficulty breathing patient developed reproducible right sided
chest pain.  She was ruled out for an MI with serial cardiac
enzymes. Her chest pain was likely musckuloskeletal. She was
initially treated with IV morphine but then weaned to Motrin
800mg TID.
