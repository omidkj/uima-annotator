ECG ([**2104-6-19**]): Sinus tachycardia. Right bundle-branch block.
There are tiny R waves in the lateral leads consistent with
possible myocardial infarction. Non-specific ST-T wave changes.
No previous tracing available for comparison.

ERCP ([**2104-6-20**]): Major papilla was found within a large
diverticulum.
Cannulation of the biliary duct was successful and deep after a
guidewire was placed. A single 5 mm stone was seen at the distal
biliary tree. Large extravasation was noted at the ducts of
Luschka. Otherwise, normal biliary tree. A sphincterotomy was
performed in the 12 o'clock position using a sphincterotome over
an existing guidewire. The stone was extracted successfully
using a balloon. A 7cm by 10FR Plastic stent biliary stent was
placed successfully.

ULTRASOUND ([**2104-6-20**]): Successful percutaneous drainage of a
biloma in the gallbladder fossa. Sample of the drained bile was
sent for microbiological analysis.

CXR ([**2104-6-20**]): Low lung volumes with mild pulmonary interstitial
abnormality, which could represent edema or chronic thickening.
Comparison with prior radiographs is recommended to aid in this
differentiation.

KUB ([**2104-6-21**]): There is a catheter projecting over the right
upper abdomen. There is air seen throughout the colon, and there
are few air-filled loops of small bowel which are non-enlarged.
Air and stool seen within the rectum. Air within the stomach.
There is a nonspecific bowel gas pattern without definite signs
for bowel obstruction. There is no free intra-abdominal gas seen
on the left side down decubitus films.


Brief Hospital Course:
1. Sepsis: Hypotensive on admission with concern for sepsis.
Started on broad specturm antibiotics with levofloxaxin,
metronidazole and vancomycin. Underwent bedside drainage of her
biloma and ERCP with sphincterotomy, stone extraction, and
biliary stent placement. Antibiotics were narrowed to
cipro/metronidazole as CXR here did not show evidence of
pneumonia.  Blood cultures from OSH as well as here were
negative to date of discharge.  She will complete 10 days of
antibiotics (to complete through [**2104-6-29**]), which will be
transitioned to po upon discharge.

2. Biloma: Underwent drainage with IR at bedside the evening of
admission. Bile cultures were without growth.  Biliary drainage
decreased to about [**10-27**] ml/day over last 3 days of admission,
so this was removed prior to discharge.

3. Hypoxia: At the OSH there was concern for pneumonia. Imaging
here showed low lung volumes with mild pulmonary interstitial
abnormality, which could represent edema or chronic thickening.
Oxygen was weaned.

4. Nausea: After initial concern for ileus or obstruction, KUB
was obtained. When this showed no evidence of obstruction, diet
was advanced slowly.

5. Transaminitis: Pt had mild transaminitis, found due to lower
abdominal cramping which was later thought to be due to
constipation, this was downtrending at discharge with no WBC or
focal exam findings.

6. Coronary artery disease: Non obstructive disease. Continued
aspirin and pravastatin. Metoprolol was initially held then
restarted; lisinopril also held and restarted just prior to
discharge.

7. Hyperlipidemia: Continued pravastatin

8. Malnutrition, moderate: Nutrition consulted.

9. Right IV infiltration: Noted after IV vancomycin
administration. Improved with arm elevation.

10. Anxiety: Continued alprazolam.

11. Constipation: started on colace as well as prn miralax.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
- Patient was DNR ok to intubate throughout this admission
- Complete 10 days of antibiotics Cipro and Flagyl through
[**2104-6-29**]
- Change dressing at previous biliary drain site daily
- follow up ERCP in 4 weeks as scheduled
