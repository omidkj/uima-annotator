HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 31-year-old gentleman
with HIV with recently undetectable viral load and CD4
greater than 200, which is complicated by HIV nephropathy and
HIV cardiomyopathy and a remote [**Doctor First Name **] infection as well as the

HOSPITAL COURSE:  This is a 31-year-old gentleman with HIV
admitted with pneumonia.

1. Pneumonia:  Patient had chest x-ray and history which were
consistent with community acquired pneumonia initially
started on levofloxacin.  Initially not concerned for PCP as
had been compliant with his medicines and stable CD4 count,
and on prophylaxis, although on single strength Bactrim,
G-6-P-D deficiency, and nonelevated LDH.

Patient was admitted initially for his pneumonia because of
hypoxemia.  Was eventually treated with levofloxacin to
complete a two week course.  However, was also hydrated in
the Emergency Room secondary to presumed insensible loss with
a fever, and was transferred to the floor, where he completed
his fluids, and had stable gas of 7.48, 58, 72 on the floor
on room air, which was stable.

However, patient was then taken to hemodialysis day of
admission for his scheduled dialysis and went into acute
respiratory distress.  Patient had a blood gas taken at that
time, which showed gas of pH of 7.36, CO2 of 42, and pO2 of
61.  Chest x-ray at that time showed asymmetric right sided
pulmonary edema.  Patient also at that time was noted to be
tachycardic into the 140s, had a blood pressure up to 202/128
and was concerned for flash pulmonary edema.  Was eventually
ultrafiltrated via dialysis and then was transferred to the
MICU for further observation.

Patient also received one dose of prednisone for concern for
acute PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **], as patient was improving with diuresis
via ultrafiltration, the patient was not continued on
treatment doses for PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] was back to his home regimen of
prophylaxis.

Over the course of his MICU stay, the patient had 6 kg of
weight ultrafiltrated, and otherwise remained stable
throughout the rest of his stay.  His oxygenation improved
after some nebulizer treatments and was nonrebreather and
essentially weaned back down to room air.  By the time of
discharge, had been ambulating and not requiring oxygen for
36 hours prior to discharge without any desaturations.

Patient also had two induced sputums sent for PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 6643**] were
negative, and patient was continued on his levofloxacin to
complete a two week course and this was stable.

2. End-stage renal disease with HIV nephropathy:  This was
stable and patient after his MICU stay continued on his
[**Name10 (NameIs) 766**], Wednesday, Friday regimen, and will follow up with
his renal nephrologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1860**] as an outpatient.

3. For patient's CHF, known ejection fraction of 20-25%
secondary to his HIV.  Was continued on his ACE inhibitor and
beta blocker, which were tolerated well and no further signs
of overload throughout the rest of his stay, and will follow
up with the CHF team as an outpatient.

4. HIV:  Stable with a CD4 count greater than 200 and
undetectable viral load.  Will continue HAART and continue
Bactrim prophylaxis.  Continue to monitor for concerns for
toxicity from HAART with history of MICU admission for lactic
acidosis and hepatic failure on Stavudine.  This will be
continued to be followed by patient's nephrologist and PCP.

5. Anemia:  This is secondary to his renal disease.  No
evidence of hemolysis.  Reticulocytes normal.  Patient was
continued on his Procrit at hemodialysis.

6. GERD:  Patient's abdominal symptoms were stable over the
course of his stay, and was continued on his proton-pump
inhibitor.

7. Nutrition:  Patient was continued on renal diet, and
continued to follow electrolytes.  He did have evidence of
hyperkalemia on day of flash edema, which improved with
dialysis of 0 K dialysis.  This was determined to be
secondary to acid-base changes.

8. Prophylaxis:  Patient was ambulating throughout his stay
and continued on his proton-pump inhibitor.

1. Pneumonia.
2. Pulmonary edema.
3. End-stage renal disease.
4. Congestive heart failure with ejection fraction of 20-25%.
5. Human immunodeficiency virus.
