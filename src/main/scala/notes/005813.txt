Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Penicillins / Prednisone

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1990**]
Chief Complaint:
S/P Fall, PNA, hypotension

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
54 YO M CAD, chronic, likely diastolic CHF who presented 3 days
after being pushed down several stairs with left wrist and ankle
pain as well as hypotension and acute renal failure. The patient
was pushed down several stairs 3 days PTA and land on his left
side injuring his left ankle, wrist and ribs. He denies any LOC
or trauma to his head. For the next 3 days he stayed in bed for
12-14 hours at a time. He was however, able to take his home
meds each day. He was experiencing chills and nightsweats. He
got up and almost fell [**1-14**] generalized weakness. Shortly after
this incident, he decided to present to the ED. In the ED, his
SBP was 90/60 so a LIJ was placed and he received 3L NS. Labs
were notable for creatinine 2.1 from 1.2 in [**8-21**]. A CXR was c/f
possible PNA so he was also given vanc/zosyn and transferred to
the MICU. In the MICU, he was given an additional 2L fluid,
continued vanc/levo. His home anti-hypertensives as well as
diuretics were held. Given his generalized malaise and NS, he
was placed on droplet precautions for r/o flu.
.
At the time of transfer, he is c/o severe left ankle pain but
has no other specific complaints. He also tells me that he was
taking naprosyn 1-2 times daily for at least 1 week. He was
given this at his rest home/residence. He did not realize he was
getting it until recently and asked that they stop giving it as
he was told never to take NSAIDs when was hospitalized with ARF
in the past.
.
Review of sytems:
(+) Per HPI, slight cough productive of green phlegm
(-) Denies fever, recent weight loss or gain. Denies headache,
sinus tenderness, rhinorrhea or congestion. Denied shortness of
breath. Denied chest pain or tightness, palpitations. Denied
nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation or abdominal pain. No
recent change in bowel or bladder habits. No dysuria. Denied
arthralgias or myalgias.

5) etoh abuse
6) Gout
7) CRI, baseline Cr 1.2; per patient [**1-14**] longterm NSAID use

   RESPIRATORY CULTURE (Preliminary):

Imaging:

[**10-21**] EKG: Rhythm may be sinus but consider also ectopic atrial
rhythm. Probable left atrial abnormality. Left axis deviation
may be due to left anterior fascicular block and consider also
possible prior inferior myocardial infarction. Anterolateral
lead ST-T wave changes are non-specific but cannot exclude
myocardial ischemia. Clinical correlation is suggested. Since
the previous tracing of [**2143-8-15**] there is no significant change.

[**10-21**] CXR:
Findings suggestive of mild congestion with left basilar opacity

reflecting either atelectasis or pneumonia/aspiration. If there
is strong
clinical concern for rib fracture, consider dedicated rib series
with skin
marker indicating the site of pain.

[**10-21**] Left hand/wrist x-ray:
No acute fracture or dislocation. Likely chronic triquetral
fracture, soft tissue swelling, osteoarthritis at the
radiocarpal joint.

[**10-21**] Left foot/ankle x-ray:
Bones are slightly demineralized. Mild degenerative disease is
seen at the
first MTP joint with adjacent areas of calcification, likely
chronic.
Retrocalcaneal spur is noted. Mild dorsal spurring along the mid
foot is seen on the lateral view of the foot. The ankle mortise
is symmetric and talar dome is smooth. No soft tissue
abnormalities are seen. No acute fracture or dislocation is
seen.

IMPRESSION: No acute findings.

[**10-23**] CXR:
There has been prior median sternotomy and coronary bypass
surgery.
Heart is upper limits of normal in size and there is a slight
upper zone
vascular re-distribution. Right-sided perihilar haziness,
peribronchial
cuffing are again demonstrated as well as a small amount of
fluid within the fissures. Within the left base, there is a
slightly improved appearance of streaky peribronchiolar
opacities with a predominantly linear orientation accompanied by
some bronchial wall thickening. This may be due to airways
related infection.


Brief Hospital Course:
54 YO M w CAD, CHF, CRI being called out from short stay in MICU
for hypotension, bradycardia and hypothermia who likely has
pneumonia after s/p fall 3 days prior to admission.

# Hypotension: Resolved. Patient presented to ED with SBP in 90s
and was briefly in the MICU for possible sepsis picture without
requirement of pressors. He was not thought to be septic given
good urine output and clinical appearance and transferred to the
floor for management. He did receive 5L of IVF while in the ED
and MICU. His hypotension was likely hypovolemia from poor PO
intake, insensible losses in the setting of chills and
nightsweats, and continued lasix and other anti-hypertensive
usage while at home.  His carvedilol was restarted and decreased
to a dose of 12.5mg [**Hospital1 **].  His lisinopril was held during
admission and should not be restarted until he meets with his
PCP.  [**Name10 (NameIs) **] cultures are still pending but urine culture from
admission was negative.  HIV test was also pending at time of
transfer to rehab.  Patient will be called and notified of
result.

# Pneumonia: Patient complained of subjective fever and chills
with night sweats at home as well as productive cough prior to
admission.  His CXR on admission showed questionable left lower
lobe pneumonia which may have been from aspiration surrounding
fall or post viral. Flu was ruled out with negative DFA. He was
stable on room air. Repeat CXR showed mild fluid overload (in
setting of holding his lasix) and questionable airways related
infection in LLL.  Treatment was started with [**Name10 (NameIs) 1378**] and
vancomycin
