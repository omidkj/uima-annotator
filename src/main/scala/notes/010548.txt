Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1943**]
Chief Complaint:
Fever, altered mental status

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Lumbar puncture

History of Present Illness:
(Pt obtunded; history obtained through OMR, group home and ED)
51 year-old man with schizophrenia and HTN who was last seen
leaving group home this morning.  Approximately 2-3pm he was
found in field near group home by some kids playing baseball.
EMS was called and brought him to the ED.  Per EMS patient was
somnolent, tremulous and with non-sensical speech.  Per group
home the patient had reported general malaise for 3 days PTA and
had been running low grade temperatures.  He was felt to have a
normal mental status the evening prior to admission.  This
morning he awoke, took his medications and went out for some
time as is his usual habit; he generally returns to the group
home in time to take his evening medications.  He recently had
some teeth extractions, but no other instrumentations or
surgeries.  At baseline, he is alert, gets assistance with meds
but otherwise fairly functional and generally very polite and
hyper-religious as a part of his schizophrenia.

In the ED, initial vs were: T 102.7 HR 129 BP 128/110 RR 22
O2Sat 100 FS 129.  On arrival to the ED, the patient had a
generalized tonic-clonic generalized seizure that lasted
approximately 30 seconds and was self-terminating.  It was
witnessed by the ED staff.  He was alert, oriented to person
only and with non-sensical speech per ED staff.  Head CT and
neck CT scan were negative.  His rectal temp was noted to be
105.1 so Toxicology consulted for extremely high fever due to
concern re: possible NMS given his psychiatric regimen.  They
felt his symtpoms were more consistent with an infectious
eitology.  Patient was given CeftriaXONE 2g IVx1, Vancomycin 1g,
Acyclovir 800 mg IV, Ampicillin Sodium 2 g IV, and tylenol 1gm
PR.  He was given ativan total of 4mg IV, 2mg for sedation in
order to perform the LP and 2mg for tremors.  LP performed and
opening pressure was 27.5.  CSF was yellow-tinged but clear
consistent with bacterial infection.  VS prior to transfer are T
102 HR 100-110 BP 140/70s O2sat 99% 3L.

IMAGING:
CXR [**2104-4-2**]: IMPRESSION: Elevated left hemidiaphragm with left
basilar atelectasis versus pneumonia. Consider lateral view to
aid in evaluation.

CT HEAD [**2104-4-2**]: -IMPRESSION:
1. No acute intracranial process.
2. Chronic sinusitis of the right maxillary sinus.

CT C-SPINE [**2104-4-2**]: -IMPRESSION:
No acute fracture or traumatic malalignment. If there is a
clinical concern for spinal cord injury, an MRI can be performed
for further assessment.

EEG [**2104-4-3**]:
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG in the waking and drowsy states due to
the
bilateral independent areas of mixed frequency slowing and due
to the
lower voltage background and loss of normal frequencies broadly
on the
right. The slowing suggests bilateral areas of subcortical
dysfunction
but cannot specify the etiology. Vascular disease is one
possibility.
The widespread lower voltage and loss of background frequencies
on the
right suggest a widespread cortical dysfunction. This could come
from
cortical loss itself (e.g. with vascular lesions) or, less
frequently,
from material interposed between the brain and recording
electrodes,
such as subdu
