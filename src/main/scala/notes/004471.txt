Respiratory Distress

none

History of Present Illness:
This is a 68 year old male with history of severe COPD on 4L
home O2, CAD, HTN, Hyperlipidemia, and GERD who called EMS this
evening for worsening shortnesss of [**First Name3 (LF) 1440**]. Per the patient he
had increased frequency of urination throughout the day
yesterday. This was without any burning with urination or
malodorous, cloudy, or bloody urine. He denied any inability to
completely void or obstructive symptoms and reported that his
increased urination had resolved as of yesterday morning. Then,
later in the evening of [**9-27**] he had increased shortness of
[**Date Range 1440**] so he called EMS. He denies any chest pain, fevers,
chills, or night sweats. No hemoptysis. He reports continued
baseline thick sputums but doesn't think this was worse over the
last few days. He denies any leg swelling, orthopnea, or PND. He
reports no chest pain associated with this.
In the ED the patient was alert and oriented *3 at presentation
and was quite interacting laughing and joking with the staff
despite an O2 sat in the 80's on room air. He was also noted at
that time to by hypotensive to SBP's in the 70's-80s. After 2
liters of fluid his SBP's improved to the 100's and his
respiratory status improved dramatically after receiving
supplementary O2, inhalers, and one dose of azithromycin.
Currently, he reports his breathing status is coming back to his
baseline.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Notable for left sided groin pain that he
reports has been going on for the last couple of days. Denies
fevers, chills, weight loss, chest pain, shortness of [**Date Range 1440**].
Denies cough. No [**Date Range **], hematochezia, hematemesis, or abdominal
pain. No dysuria or hematuria. No weakness or dizziness though
patient is not particularly physical active at baseline.

Imaging:
CXR: CHEST, PORTABLE UPRIGHT FRONTAL VIEW: The lungs are
hyperinflated and lucent consistent with COPD. There is no focal
airspace consolidation or effusion. A horizontally oriented
linear lucent band across the inferior mediastinum corresponds
with the [**Month/Day/Year 499**] when compared to the previous chest CTA. The
aorta is markedly tortuous with vascular calcifications. Heart
size is normal. Hilar and mediastinal contours are stable.

IMPRESSION: COPD. No pneumonia.


Brief Hospital Course:
68 y.o. male with COPD, CAD, Hypertension, and Hyperlipidemia
presenting with increased shortness of [**Month/Day/Year 1440**] at home and found
to be hypoxic.

#) Respiratory Distress/ COPD Exacerbation: Unclear precipitant,
but he does report that his granddaughter who lives with himself
and his wife had a cold last week and does have a dry cough.
Likely viral illness precipitating exacerbation of RAD/asthma
component. No pneumonia on CXR. No swelling, JVD, or signs of
heart failure. Given dramatic improvement on measures
implemented so far will continue to treat for COPD exacerbation
and monitor. Given lack of headache/fever/myalgias or any active
viral prodrome did not feel inclined to test for flu at this
time as minimal presentation in MA so far and very unlikely to
be consistent with this.  Continued on azithromycin 500 mg daily
and home inhalers. Patient switched from methylpred to 40 mg PO
prednisone daily starting on [**2107-9-28**].  Continued on albuterol
and albuterol/ipratroprium short acting nebs PRN, as well as
montleukast, fluticasone-salmeterol, and tiotroprium.  After
transfer out of the MICU, his steroid taper was increased to
prednisone 60mg daily, with planes for a slow taper down to 20mg
daily, which he will continue.  Additionally, he was continued
on azithromycin to complete a 5 day course.  After two days on
the floor of continued nebulizer treatments, steroids and
antibiotics he felt that his breathing had returned to his
baseline and he felt that he was ready for discharge.

#) Hypotension: Patient had brisk response to fluids and
appeared dry on presentation. After fluid resuscitation his
blood pressure stabilized and after transfer to the floor he had
no further episodes of hypotension.  At the time of discharge,
his blood pressure had increased and he was instructed to
restart his lisinopril when he returned home.

#)Acute renal failure: Patient's Cr on admission was 2 from
baseline of 0.6-0.7.  Given dehydration and hypotension, it was
thought that there was a component of pre-renal but also concern
for hypoperfusion due to the hypotension.  Urine studies and a
renal ultrasound were performed but his renal function rapidly
returned to his baseline with fluid resuscitation.

#) History of CAD: No signs of active ischemia on admission, but
did have slight increase in troponins with normal CK's, likely
due to strain in the setting of hypotension and decreased
clearance with his acute renal failure.  Continued his
outpatient CAD medications, while in the hospital.

#) Chronic Pain: Remained stable, continued home regimen of
oxycodone/APAP and fentanyl patch.

#) Code Status: DNR/DNI
