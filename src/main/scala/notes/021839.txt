Pertinent Results:
CXR (Portable) [**2175-11-30**]: Mild cardiomegaly is exaggerated by
lordotic positioning. There may be very mild pulmonary edema.
Conventional radiograph should be obtained for confirmation.
Atelectasis at the left lung base is mild. Pleural effusion is
small if any. No pneumothorax.
.
Cardiac catheterization [**2175-12-1**]:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Severe diastolic ventricular dysfunction.
3. Moderate primary pulmonary hypertension.
.
Echocardiogram: The left atrium is moderately dilated. Left
ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There
is moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
hypokinesis of the distal half of the anterior septum, anterior,
lateral wall, and apex. There is mild hypokinesis of the
remaining segments (LVEF = 35 %). No masses or thrombi are seen
in the left ventricle. Right ventricular chamber size and free
wall motion are normal. The ascending aorta and aortic arch are
mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
structurally normal. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild to
moderate ([**11-25**]) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is moderate
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
effusion.
IMPRESSION: Normal left ventricular cavity size with regional
dysfunction c/w multivessel CAD. Moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. Mild-moderate mitral regurgitation.
Dilated thoracic aorta.
.
Carotid Duplex:
1. Less than 40% stenosis of the right internal carotid artery.
2. 80-99% stenosis of the left internal carotid artery.


Brief Hospital Course:
62 year old male with PMH significant for CAD, HL, DM and HTN
who presented with 7-10 days of shortness of breath, found to
have had an anterior MI. Prior to be taken to the operating room
the patient underwent cardiac catheterization which showed that
he had three vessel disease and severe diastolic dysfunction.
Initially after his catheterization he was diuresed in the CCU
with a swan ganz catheter in place, carotid ultrasounds which
showed an 80-99% stenosis of his left ICA.

He was taken to the operating room for a coronary artery bypass
graft surgery on [**2175-12-6**].  See operative note for details. He
was transferred to the CVICU in stable condition.  He was weaned
off epinephrine on post operative day 1 and neosynephrine was
weaned post operative day 2 with good hemodynamics (cardiac
index >2).  He was extubated post operative night without
incidence.  Chest tubes and pacing wires were removed per
caridac surgery protocol.  He was noted to have a small left
apical pneumothorax on the post chest tube CXR, which remained
stable and he maintained good oxygen saturation.  He was
transferred to the floor on post operative day 2 in stable
condition.

Postoperatively on day #2 in the evening after a visit to the
bathroom, he was sitting in a chair and underwent sudden
ventricular fibrillation and was initially
defibrillated successfully with 300 Joules.  He was intubated on
the step down unit and transferred to the CVICU.  Recurrent
attacks of ventricular fibrillation occurred after he was
transferred to the unit. Subsequent resuscitation was continued
in the ICU. He was put on ECMO after multiple internal cardiac
massage after opening the chest in the intensive care unit
failed. Subsequently he was
taken to the operating room in ventricular fibrillation on ECMO
for conversion to cardiopulmonary pass and for arresting the
heart to see if recovery happens.  There the ECMO subcu was
converted to a full cardiopulmonary bypass. A left ventricular
vent was also inserted along with pulmonary artery vent for
complete decompression of the heart. After 1 hour of arrest on
cardiac pulmonary bypass and active pharmacological
resuscitation and correction of blood gases, etc., multiple
attempts were made to wean him off the cardiopulmonary pass but
were unsuccessful. Heart was
repeatedly going into ventricular fibrillation and could not
maintain any meaningful hemodynamics. Both the right ventricle
and the left ventricle were globally affected. The 3 vein grafts
seemed soft and pliable with no evidence of
occlusion seen externally. The mammary artery, as well, seemed
to be patent. After many hours of resuscitation, finally further
attempts were stopped and the patient was declared.
