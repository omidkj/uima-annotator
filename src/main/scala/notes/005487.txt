Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 65686**]
Chief Complaint:
syncope

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
82F with HTN and GBM s/p resection, chemo, and radiation
discharged 2 days ago from OMED admitted to the MICU for
syncopal episode with NSTEMI and relative hypotension. The
patient has a history of GBM s/p resection [**2136-12-30**] and
chemo/radiation who was admitted to the OMED service for
pancytopenia. She was discharged home on [**2137-4-5**] on new
medications for neutropoenia: Ciprofloxacin 500mg [**Hospital1 **], Fluc
200mg qd and Acyclovir 400mg TID. She was instructed to stop
hctz, Lisinopril and Keppra (because they thought this
contributed the cytopoenia).
.
Last night, per ED history, the patient was walking to the
bathroom and prior to reaching the toilet had a sudden syncopal
event with fall and headstrike to bathroom wall with +LOC. Per
the patient, she was sitting on the toilet and felt an
overwhelming "warmth" and premonition of illness. She does not
recall falling off the toilet or striking her face but she does
know that this happened. Of note, she had incontinence to stool
but no frank seizure-like movements or tongue biting (witnessed
by her daughters). She was sent to hospital for syncope workup.

.
ED COURSE:
In the ED, initial VS were 97.4, 100, 106/63, 18, 96%. EKG
revealed STD in V2-V6 as well as II, III, and AVF. Labs were
significant for a white count of 2.9 with differential of 48%
neutrophils, hematocrit of 26.0, and platelet count of 21. Serum
chemistries were unremarkable. Troponin-T was 0.56, CK 291, MB
36. Cardiology was consulted and felt her elevated trop without
cardiac symptoms was likely the result of demand-like ischemia
in the setting of possible hypotension. She also underwent
multiple radiographic investigations:
1. CTA Chest With and Without Contrast: no PE.
2. CT C-Spine Without Contrast: no acute process.
3. CT Head Without Contrast: no acute intracranial process.
4. Pelvic XR: ordered and pendin
Her UA was significant only for an elevated Sp.Gravity.
.
Of note, patient entered to ED with BP's in the 100's
systolically which dropped to the 80's. She had two peripheral
IV's placed and was fluid responsive to 2LNS. She was also
initiated on vanc/cefepime for concern of possible sepsis.
Discussion between cardiology team and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 60181**] (her
neuro-oncologist) felt that patient would be best served on on
the West MICU given her multiple comorbidities.
.
On arrival to the MICU, she is pleasant and conversant. Denies
any pain. She is noted to desaturate to 85 on shovel mask with
laboured breathing.
