Brief Hospital Course:
# Cellulitis/Rhabdomyolysis: Pt was found down with fevers,
erythema and elevated CK concerning for severe soft tissue
infection.  He was imaged and sent to the ICU for initial
management.  After 24hrs in ICU, pt was clinically improving and
felt most likely to have a simple cellulitis with an associated
CK elevation.  Given his history of MRSA, he was treated with
Vanc/Ceftriaxone for a 8 day course.  He remained afebrile with
normal WBC and blood Cx remained negative for growth.  He had an
u/s of his left buttock to evaluate induration and it was
negative for any fluid collection.   Elevated CKs were thought
more likely due to muscle breakdown given the many hours he was
down and pt was aggressively hydrated with rapid improvement in
CKs.  PT was consulted to help with mobilization and pt was
given a cane to use at home.
.
# Withdrawal: Pt was noted to have withdrawal like symptoms on
day 3 of hospitalization.  He was notably diaphoretic,
tachycardic, tremulous and hypertensive.  He denied abusing ETOH
but admitted to Ativan abuse (many tabs per day) and he was
treated with Diazepam and CIWA monitoring.   The benzo abuse
helped explain the amount of time he was down without calling
for help and having developed rhabdo. Addictions and Social Work
were consulted and pt was able to rapidly wean from Diazepam.
PCP was notified and pt has follow up scheduled with his primary
psychiatrist.   Pt was strongly encouraged to avoid ETOH and
benzos.  He was not given any benzo prescriptions on discharge.
.
# Urinary retention: Pt was treated with doxazosin 2mg qhs and
has complete resolution of symptoms.  He was encouraged to keep
his follow up appointment with Urology.
.
# Hypertension: BP were noted to be elevated even after getting
withdrawal symptoms under control.  Pt was started Lisinopril
10mg daily and was scheduled to follow up with his PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**9-9**].
 He was instructed to get labs drawn at that time to follow up
on his electrolytes.
.
# Pain control: Pt was noted to have a high narcotic
tolerance/requirement and after discussion with PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] was
discovered that he was on a Suboxone contract.  Pt was treated
with po/iv dilaudid while in house and was discharged without
any prescriptions for pain medications.  He was continued on
Neurontin 1600mg TID which seemed to help with his pain control.
.
# Asthma: Pt was continued on Advair [**Hospital1 **] with Albuterol and
Ipratropium nebulizers PRN.
