Pertinent Results:
[**2105-10-15**] CT CHEST W/CONTRAST:
1. Displaced fractures of the left anterolateral 3rd through 6th

small left pneumothorax.
2. Nondisplaced sternal fracture without significant hematoma or
vascular
injury.
3. Trace left-sided pleural effusion measuring simple fluid
density.
4. Significant subcutaneous emphysema over the left anterior
chest wall.

[**2105-10-15**] CT C-SPINE W/O CONTRAST:
Possible nondisplaced fracture of the left transverse process of

T1. No other fractures identified. Mild anterolisthesis of C6 on
C7, age
indeterminate, may be due to degenerative change.

[**2105-10-16**] ANKLE (AP, MORTISE & LAT) BILAT PORT:
Right distal fibular fracture.

[**2105-10-16**] Echo:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size
and regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%).
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened (?#). There is no
aortic valve stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Normal global and regional biventricular systolic
function. Mild mitral regurgitation. Moderate pulmonary
hypertension.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 32734**] was admitted on [**2105-10-15**] under the acute care
surgery service to the trauma ICU for further evaluation and
management of her injuries. She remained hemodynamically stable
on [**2105-10-18**] and was transferred to the surgical floor.

She had a significant forehead laceration was sutured on
admission. Sutures were removed prior to discharge and site
remained clean and dry at the time of discharge.

Neuro: A thoracic epidural was placed on [**2105-10-16**] for pain
management given her rib fractures, which was removed on
[**2105-10-19**]. She was transitioned from IV to PO analgesics. By the
day of discharge on [**2105-10-26**], her pain was well-controlled with
scheduled tylenol and prn tramadol and low dose oxycodone. On
[**2105-10-21**], Ms. [**Known lastname 32734**] was triggered for a transient episode of
altered mental status. Urine cultures were sent which were
negative. A chest xray was obtained which stable showed
bibasilar atelectasis and no evidence of infiltrate. She
remained hemodynamically stable during this episode, which
resolved quickly without intervention. She remained alert and
oriented at her baseline mental status upon discharge.

Cardiac: Her vital signs were monitored routinely throughout her
hospitalization. On arrival to the ED, her ECG showed rapid
atrial fibrillation with RVR (history of known atrial
fibrillation). She was rate controlled initially with IV beta
blockers in the ICU, and was then transitioned to her home
cardiac medications. She remained in atrial fibrillation at her
baseline throughout her floor course, with adequate rate control
in the 60s and 70s. A bedside echo was performed to evaluate her
cardiac function on [**2105-10-16**] (see pertinent results section). On
[**10-24**], she became slighly hypotensive down to a systolic BP of
80 with diuresis. On [**10-25**] albumin was given and her systolic BP
remained > 100 thereafter.

Pulm: A pigtail CT was placed on admission given her left sided
pneumothorax. It was removed on [**10-18**], with the post-pull chest
xray showing no evidence of pneumothorax. Subsequent chest xrays
showed bibasilar pleural effesions, and aggressive pulmonary
toileting and incentive spirometry were encouraged. A chest xray
on [**10-25**] revealed mild pulmonary edema, and gentle diuresis was
continued with lasix. She was also started on nebulizers as
needed. Her O2 therapy was weaned and her O2 sats remained in
the high 90's on 3L of NC at the time of discharge.

GI: On admission she was kept NPO and given IV fluids for
hydration. On [**10-16**] she was placed on a regular diet. On [**10-18**],
she began to develop nausea. She continued to have intermittent
episodes of nausea/vomiting, and a KUB on [**10-19**] showed evidence
of an ileus. She was given a 1X dose of methylnaltrexone as well
as a dulcolax suppository, and she subsequently had multiple
bowel movements. She subsequently had multiple episodes of
diarrhea, and stool samples were sent for c. diff and she was
empirically started on oral flagyl. She continued to be
intermittently nauseated and a repeat KUB was obtained on [**10-23**]
which showed continued evidence of an ileus with dilation of the
stomach, small, and large bowel. On [**10-25**] she was c. diff
negative x's 3 samples and flagyl was discontinued. On [**10-26**],
she denied any further nausea and vomiting, and was tolerating a
regular diet with no abdominal pain.

GU: U/A on admission was suspicious for a UTI and she was placed
on a 3 day course of oral ciprofloxacin. A repeat U/A [**10-18**] was
normal. A foley catheter was placed for urine output monitoring
on admission. It was removed on [**
