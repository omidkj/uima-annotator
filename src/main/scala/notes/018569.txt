History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 55 year-old woman with past medical history
significant for h/o TBM, paradoxical vocal fold movements
(PVFM), GERD, HTN, and OSA on home CPAP. Patient states she was
at work in [**Hospital3 4298**] this morning and felt suddenly
anxious, very short of breath and with a coughing fit. She tried
used her nebulizer but without relief. Her boss became very
concerned and called '911' and she was transfered to the ED in
[**Hospital3 4298**]. She describes associated sharp sternal pain
and back pain and pain on inspiration. Pt also had 3 'coughing
attacks' the day prior to admission which resolved with
nebulizers. She denies any associated chest pains, dizziness,
palpitations. No fainting episodes.

On additional history she explains that she has had "breathing
troubles" since [**2198-4-13**] after she had developed acute
angioedema and anaphylaxis that was attributed to lisinopril. Pt
reports that these coughing episodes are not associated with a
known trigger, a particular location or time of day. Further
workup by IP demonstrated tracheo-bronchomalacia and she had a
silicone Y stent placed with subsequent removal after recent
flexible bronchoscopy on [**5-10**] which demonstrated severe
granulation tissue at the right distal end of the Y-stent.

To date, she has had multiple hospital and ICU admissions (one
intubation) during this past year, with prior bronchoscopy also
demonstrating paradoxical vocal fold movements.

At OSH emergency room the patient was given 125mg IV solumedrol,
racemic epinephrine, combivent nebs and a total of 9mg ativan
over several hours. She was placed on 6L nasal cannula at OSH
with improvement on her dyspnea and stridor. En route to [**Hospital1 18**]
ED patient was given additional 75mg fentanyl and 4mg Zofran
with med-flight team.

In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, initial vs were: T afebrile, HR 103, BP
138/112, RR 24 and O2 sats 94% on 6L nasal canula. She was given
some additional racemic epinephrine nebs and duonebs in ED.
Given Levaquin 750mg IV x1 for question of LLL infiltrate on
portable CXR. She has no recent
fevers or leukocytosis on labs.

On arrival to ICU, initial vitals were: T 96.9F, HR 105, BP
150/88, RR 18 and O2 sat 94% on 5L NC. She appeared very anxious
but able to speak full sentences without minimal shortness of
breath.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 55yo F with TBM, OSA on home CPAP, HTN, and
questionable paradoxical vocal cord dysfunction who was admitted
to ICU as OSH transfer for acute dyspnea and stridor.

# PVFM, paradoxical vocal fold movement: ENT assessment again
shows PVFM.  Mainstay of treatment is outpatient Speech/Voice
therapy. The patient saw, Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 449**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] at [**Hospital1 2025**] for a second
opinion and was also recommended to have speech therapy.

This patient has had frequent admissions for this same issue.
IP, Psychiatry, ENT, and Speech Therapy were all consulted to
help with developing a longterm plan and also to try to
formulate a more successful outpatient plan.

Here are some interventions and recommendations:

1. Metoprolol was discontinued for concern of bronchospasm as a
side effect.
2. Psychiatry provided relaxation techniques and recommended
outpatient Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (see Dr.[**Name (NI) 60808**]
note). Also increase dose of SSRI and for patient to use fast
acting anxiolytics.
3. IP recommends maximizing Asthma and GERD treatments to
minimize coughing.  Coughing is one of her major stimuli for
going into an acute dyspneic episode.
4. ENT recommends further speech/voice therapy
5. Speech Therapy recommends more aggressive outpatient speech
therapy (3-4 sessions weekly)

A consensus letter will be prepared by this author and Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]
[**Name (STitle) **] to outline a proposed treatment plan for the [**Location (un) 7453**] providers to try to reduce unnecessary helicopter
transfers.  The patient is nearly 100% successful in having her
episodes resolved in the hospital with relaxation techniques,
neb treatments, and use of anxiolytics.

If outpatient management fails, then future disposition to
[**Hospital 3058**] rehab should be considered.
