Physical Exam:
VS: 65.6 116/57 56 20 99%RA
HEENT: EOMI, PERRL, OP benign
Neck: Supple, FROM, R Carotid Bruit, Well healed small scar
Lungs: CTAB -w/r/r
CV: Hard to hear, -c/r/m/g
Abd: Soft, NT/ND +BS
Ext: Warm, decreased PP, trace bilat edema

Pertinent Results:
Echo [**5-22**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated. The left
ventricular cavity is severely dilated. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is moderately-to-severely depressed (ejection
fraction 30 percent) secondary to extensive apical akinesis with
focal dyskinesis. There are focal calcifications in the aortic
arch. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but
aortic stenosis is not present. Trace aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is
no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired
relaxation. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial
effusion.
CXR [**5-26**]: Median sternotomy wires are seen. The distal portion
of a vascular sheath in the internal jugular vein is again seen
and high. Previously, there was a kink within the sheath;
however, the portion of the kink has been excluded on this
study, and it is unclear whether or not the catheter kink has
been readjusted. There is marked cardiomegaly which is increased
since the previous study. There are some linear densities seen
at the base most consistent with subsegmental atelectasis. No
focal consolidation is seen. There are no signs for overt
congestive heart failure.

Brief Hospital Course:
As mentioned in the HPI, Mr. [**Known lastname 34909**] was electively admitted
prior to surgery and underwent usual pre-operative work-up. He
also had a psychiatry and cardiology/EP consultation. Following
consent and stable lab work, he was brought to the operating
room on [**2192-5-23**] where he underwent a coronary artery bypass graft
x 6. Please see operative report for surgical details. He
tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to the CSRU for
invasive monitoring in stable condition. He did require
Amiodarone bolus and drip when coming off CPB secondary to VT.
Very early on post-op day one he was weaned from sedation, awoke
neurologically intact and extubated. Chest tubes were removed on
post-op day two. Beta blockers and diuretics were started and he
was gently diuresed towards his pre-op weight. He was transfused
multiple times with PRBCs secondary to low HCT. At time of
discharge HCT was 28.1. Throughout CSRU post-op course he had
multiple episodes of VT/Atrial Fibrillation and remained on
Amiodarone. Mr. [**Known lastname 34909**] remained in the CSRU until post-op day
four when he was transferred to the cardiac surgery step down
floor. Physical therapy worked with Mr. [**Known lastname 34909**] during entire
post-op course for strength and mobility. Mr. [**Known lastname 34909**] continued
to have episodes of atrial fibrillation and thus coumadin was
started for anticoagulation. He remained stable and was
discharged to his rest facility on post-op day seven with the
appropriate follow-up appointments. He will take coumadin daily
for a  goal INR of 2.0-2.5. His last dose was today [**2192-5-30**] of
5mg and he will have his blood (PT/INR) checked tomorrow with
results sent to Dr.[**Name (NI) 1912**] office for continued dosing.
Amiodarone will be continued on a wean starting today ([**2192-5-30**])
which will be 400mg twice daily for 6 days, then 400mg once
daily for 7 days, then 200mg once daily thereafter.
