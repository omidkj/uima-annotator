Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3705**]
Chief Complaint:
cough, sob x 2days

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
70 year-old man w/ systolic CHF, CAD s/p 5V CABG, Afib
(coumadin/dig), type II DM, hypothyroidism, chronic renal
failure, who was transferred from an [**Hospital3 **] ED for
hypotension, coagulopathy, fever. He initially presented to
[**Location (un) 4444**] health clinic on [**3-12**] with 2 days of SOB, worsening
DOE, orthopnea, dry cough. At the clinic, the pt was given 80mg
IV lasix for presumed CHF exacerbation. He was then sent to
[**Hospital3 2783**] where he was found to have gross
coagulopathy (PT 215, PTT 109, INR 8.2), possible PNA, and fever
(?101). At the OSH, he became hypotensive w/ SBP of 50's. He was
given NS 250ml x 2 and levaquin 750mg for empiric tx of presumed
pna, although the CXR was read as normal. CE were neg. Lacate as
2.44. Blood cx were collected. Of note, pt. had 2 recent med
changes (metformin->actos, tricor -> [**Hospital3 107356**]).
In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED: initial vitals were- T 99.2 BP 92/56 HR 70 RR
20 02sat 99% on 4L. The pt again became hypotensive and was
given 2L of NS. After IVF, he developed SOB (02 sat 90% on 3L)
and was briefly required a NRB. He was given 2u of FFP and
started on peripheral levophed. He was given 1g of ceftrioxone
and admited to the MICU for further management. On arrival to
the MICU pt. had a new pruritic, erythematous rash on abdomen
chest and knees, which responded to benadryl/famotadine.

ROS: denies fevers, chill, sick contacts. Admits to dry cough.
denies urinary symptoms or diarrhea. Notes a recent fall with
fractured R 6th rib. DOE w/ 1 flight of stairs, orthopnea, PND
over the past 2 days. Denies poor wound healing or bleeding
recently.

[**2167-3-12**] Renal U/S: IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of hydronephrosis. Nonobstructing 7 mm left renal
calculus.
2. 8-10 mm echogenic foci with tram tracking appearance in the
right kidney suggestive of an intraureteral stent but may also
represent renal calculi in the absence of such history. Clinical
correlation is recommended.

[**2167-3-12**] CXR: IMPRESSION:
1. Vague increased patchy opacity in the right lower lung. This
may be the area where prior pneumonia has been seen. Comparison
with prior would be helpful.
2. No evidence of congestive heart failure.

[**3-12**] ECG: Atrial fibrillation with moderate ventricular
response. Occasional ventricular
premature beats. Poor R wave progression suggests possible prior
old
anteroseptal myocardial infarction. Modest inferolateral ST-T
wave changes
which are non-specific. Compared to the previous tracing of
[**2153-2-28**] there is no significant diagnostic change.

[**2167-3-12**] ECHO: The left atrium is moderately dilated. There is
mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity
size. Overall left ventricular systolic function is moderately
depressed (LVEF= 30-40 %). [Intrinsic left ventricular systolic
function is likely more depressed given the severity of valvular
regurgitation.] Right ventricular chamber size is normal. with
depressed free wall contractility. [Intrinsic right ventricular
systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of
tricuspid regurgitation.] The aortic root is moderately dilated
at the sinus level. The ascending aorta is moderately dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. There
is moderate to severe aortic valve stenosis (area 0.8-1.0cm2).
No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. There is
severe mitral annular calcification. There is a minimally
increased gradient consistent with trivial mitral stenosis.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic
shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may be
significantly UNDERestimated.] Moderate [2+] tricuspid
regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial effusion.

   RADIOLOGY  Final Report

CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2167-3-17**] 11:36 AM

CHEST (PA & LAT)

Reason: Please evaluate for interval change

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
70 year old man with Aortic Stenosis, CAD, s/p CABG, a/w
influenza and pneumonia
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
Please evaluate for interval change
INDICATION: Aortic stenosis, now with influenza, and persistent
cough.

CHEST, TWO VIEWS: Comparison with [**2167-3-12**]. In the
interim, a small right pleural effusion has accumulated.
Cardiac, mediastinal, and hilar contours are unchanged, with
cardiomegaly again noted. The interstitial abnormality
throughout both lungs including [**Last Name (un) 16765**] B-lines and indistinct
pulmonary vasculature can represent interstitial changes from
chronic cardiac failure. There are no focal consolidations.
Osseous structures including midline sternotomy wires and CABG
staples are unchanged.

IMPRESSION: Small right pleural effusion and chronic
interstitial changes, which can be seen in chronic heart
failure. No focal consolidations. Findings discussed with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] by phone at 2:00 p.m., [**2167-3-17**].

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 70 yo M w/ CHF, Afib, CAD s/p CABG, DMII, acute on chronic
RF, recent DOE and cough, transferred from OSH for hypotension,
fever, gross coagulopathy, acute on chronic RF.

# Fever and pneumonia due to influenza A: The patient's DFA was
positive for flu.  In ICU started empirically on levaquin for
pneumonia and then transitioned to unasyn.  After stabilization,
patient was transferred to the floor for management.  Kept on
droplet precautions for influenza and continued on unasyn
overnight.  Then transitioned to PO augmentin
