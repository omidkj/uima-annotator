Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3283**]
Chief Complaint:
Fatigue

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
ICU stay, Intubation, Mechanical Ventilation
CT guided biopsy of liver.

History of Present Illness:
65 yo M with h/o duodenal ulcer and GERD p/w BRBPR who was
recently diagnosed with a splenic flexure mass, most likely
originating from the kidney who presents with fatigue, chills,
shortness of breath and decreased appetite. The pt reports that
for about one week now he has had decreased appetite and has
only been able to soft foods and liquids. Last Friday he started
to notice worsening SOB but only with ambulation associated with
a mild, dry cough. Today in the afternoon he started to note
chills and rigors and decided to come into the hospital.
.
In the ED, VS were 101.9, HR 124, BP 139/61, RR30, O2Sat 93RA. A
CXR showed b/l LL infiltrates R>L. The patient was given
Levofloxacin and Ceftriaxone for PNA. Lactate was found to be
elevated at 7.8. He was given 4L of NS. Lactate decreased to
2.7. A CT abdomen was done whihc confirmed the large LUQ mass
but did not show signs of other pathology, specifically an
ischemic bowel. The patient continued to be tachycardic but was
never hypotensive in the ED (lowest BP 92/66). His O2
requirements remained at 3L with O2 sats 96-99.
.
ROS: positive for about 15lb weight loss in last 2 weeks. The
patient also reports intermittent abdominal pain, present for
weeks, but worsening since discharge from the hospital. He
reports that the pain is worse when lying on the R side and
about 15-20min after eating especially cold foods. Pt denies HA,
vision changes, CP, N, V, D, changes in the color of his stool
or urine and specifically melena or BRBPR. He also denies
myalgias or arthralgias.

CT ABDOMEN
1. Marked short-interval progression of extremely large and
aggressive left upper quadrant mass that appears to arise from
the tail of the pancreas with new compression of the stomach and
near-complete encasement of the splenic flexure of the colon.
Frank infiltration of the stomach and colon cannot be excluded.

2. Previously reported splenic vein thrombus now extends to the
portal venous confluence and there are now new enlarged
collateral vessels present within the anterior abdomen. The
presence of splenic thrombosis at time of presentation also
favors a pancreatic origin of this mass.

3. Innumerable new liver metastasis with interval growth of two
dominant metastases compared to CT of only two weeks ago.
Multiple lung metastases and left hilar nodal masses, as
described.

4. No CT evidence of mesenteric ischemia.

CTA CHEST
1. No pulmonary embolus.

2. Multiple nodules/masses scattered throughout the lungs
consistent with metastases. Mediastinal and hilar
lymphadenopathy.

3. Small bilateral pleural effusions and adjacent atelectasis.
Scattered ground-glass opacities seen throughout both lungs with
more focal consolidative process within the right lower lobe
which may represent infection.

4. Diffuse hepatic metastatic lesions and splenic flexure mass,
better evaluated on CT abdomen and pelvis of [**2105-2-22**].

5. Asymmetric enlargement of the left lobe of the thyroid.

BIOPSY: CYTOLOGY
POSITIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS
  consistent with poorly-differentiated malignant neoplasm,
  see note.


Brief Hospital Course:
PNEUMONIA / GRAM POSITIVE ROD BACTEREMIA:
The patient was admitted to the MICU from the ED for an elevated
lactate and concern for early/evolving sepsis, with new RLL
pneumonia. He was fluid resussitated and empirically started on
vanco, cipro, and cefepime for antimicrobial coverage. His
lactate level dropped over the course of several hours. Imaging
showed interval progression of his flank mass, including more
hepatic lesions and extension of his splenic vein thrombosis,
previously seen but not anticoagulated given his admission for
GIB. Blood cultures grew out gram positive rods, and he was
continued on his empiric antibiotics. Overall, he was
hemodynamically stable, lactate cleared, and he was transferred
to the floor.

He was later readmitted to the medical intensive care unit with
respiratory distress. He was intubated for respiratory distress.
He had low negative inspiratory pressures. He was extubated but
required high oxygen amounts, including non-rebreather. His CXR
was consistent with aspiration or hemorrhage, along with several
metastatic desposits.

METASTATIC CARCINOMA, UNKNOWN PRIMARY
The patient was found to have a malignant lesion, large in size
and diffusely metastatic to liver, peritoneum, and lung, on
prior admission last month. On admission, he had interval
progression and increase in number of his liver lesions. He
underwent CT guided biopsy of one liver lesion. Final pathology
was pending at time of discharge, but consistent with a very
poorly differentiated carcinoma.

Given the patient's extensive tumor burden, and in conjunction
with palliative care consultation and help from the patient's
primary care physician, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] decision was ultimately reached by
his health care proxy and family to make the patient comfort
measures/comfort care only. He was transferred to the floor of
the hospital where he expired.
