at [**Hospital 38**] Rehab facility.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Central line with cordis placement for SGC in the Rt. femoral

History of Present Illness:
Pt. is an 86 yo male with h/o chronic afib, cad, recently
discharged from [**Hospital1 18**] ([**Date range (1) 7154**]) s/p pericardial window for
tamponade. Pt. was discharged to the [**Hospital 38**] Rehab. facility
where after spending less then 24 hours at the facility he began
experiencing increasing SOB with oxygen sats dropping into the
80's on room air.  The pt. required NRB and at the ED his oxygen
sats improved on BIPAP.  CXR showed mild failure, B/L effusions
R>L, and no ischemic ECG changes. He got 50 mg IV ethacrynic
acid in ED. He spiked a fever of 102 and levofloxacin was
started in the ED. Repeat ECHO in ED was unchanged from the one
at discharge. Admitted to CCU for diuresis and close monitoring.

CXR [**2144-6-18**]
1) Congestive heart failure with bilateral pleural effusions.
2) Bibasilar atelectasis/consolidation.

ECHO [**2144-6-18**]
The left atrium is markedly dilated. The right atrium is
markedly dilated. No
atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Overall
left ventricular
systolic function is moderately depressed (ejection fraction
30-40 percent)
secondary to extensive severe apical hypokinesis, and at least
mild
hypokinesis of the rest of the left ventricle. The right
ventricular free wall
is hypertrophied. The right ventricular cavity is dilated. Right
ventricular
systolic function appears depressed. There is abnormal septal
motion/position
consistent with right ventricular pressure/volume overload. The
aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Moderate to severe
(3+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The mitral regurgitation jet is
eccentric. The
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The supporting
structures of
the tricuspid valve are thickened/fibrotic. Moderate to severe
[3+] tricuspid
regurgitation is seen. There is severe pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension.
There is a small posterolateral pericardial effusion, as well as
a moderate
sized loculated pericardial effusion subtending the right atrial
free wall.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade. No right
atrial or right
ventricular diastolic collapse is seen. Echocardiographic signs
of tamponade
may be absent in the presence of elevated right sided pressures.


Compared with the findings of the prior study (tape reviewed) of
[**2144-6-11**],
no major change is evident.


Brief Hospital Course:
Pt. was admitted to the CCU for diuresis and close monitoring.
Pt. was started on Ceftriaxone and Azithromycin, and the
levofloxacin was d/c'ed.  Blood cultures came back positive for
coag. + staph. aureus X 4.  Vanco was started and then switched
to nafcillin + levo after sensitivities and ID consulted.  Also
initially treated for CHF exacerbation w/ natrecor, ethacrynic
acid.  Pt. became lethargic, had inc. in creatinine, metabolic
alk. secondary to diuresis, and was hypoventilating.  Began
fluid boluses to inc. volume status . Attempted SGC, however was
unable to pass tricuspid valve secondary to severe TR.  Renal
fxn continued to deteriorate, and the pt. had worsening of the
pleural effusions.  The patient also developed black melanotic
stools and was given 1 unit of PRBC's.  The team had a
discussion with  Mr. [**Known lastname **] and his family, and it was decided to
no longer persue aggressive invasive procedures.  Mr. [**Known lastname **]
continued to have worsening acute renal failure and respiratory
distress and it was decided after further discussion with the
family to make Mr. [**Known lastname **] DNR/DNI with comfort measures only.
All his medications/treatments were stopped except for morphine
prn pain and comfort, oxygen, and foley. Mr. [**Known lastname **] passed away
at 0200 on [**2144-6-27**]
