History of Present Illness:
78 y/o F with a hx of PMR on chronic steroids, type 2 DM, CHF
w/EF 50%, DVT [**9-14**] who presents with a one day history of
diarrhea.  Pt reports she woke up in the middle of the night a
day ago and had diarrhea.  She had six episodes throughout the
course of the day and felt weak.  She had no other symptoms,
including nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, fever, chills,
cough, shortness of breath, chest pain, dysuria, urinary
frequency, or any other complaints.  No recent travel or change
in eating habits.
*
In the ED here, she was febrile to 101, hypotensive to 88/49,
tachy in the 100s.  Cultures were drawn and she was given
levofloxacin and flagyl given the abdominal pain.  Her initial
lactate was 2.9, she had a WBC count of 20 with a left shift and
8% bands, and her creatinine was elevated at 1.3 from 0.9 3
months ago.  An abdominal CT was done to r/o an abscess (given
that she's on chronic steroids) and it showed diverticulosis but
no diverticulitis, as well as stable dilation of her CBD.  She
was given 2 liters of IVF and her lactate worsened to 4.  She
remained hypotensive in the 80s-90s.  She was mentating and
making urine throughout.  At this point, because of the lactate
and hypotension, she was placed on the sepsis protocol.  A
central line was placed, and a mixed venous sat was monitored
(low 70s).  She received an additional 2 liters of NS and her bp
remained in the 90s.

CT abd: ABDOMEN CT WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: Two calcifications
are again visualized in the right breast. There is mild
atelectasis at the visualized lung bases. The liver,
gallbladder, spleen, adrenal glands, and kidneys appear
unremarkable. Pancreatic duct is dilated throughout, unchanged
compared to the previous study. There is no free fluid or
peripancreatic fat stranding. Small bowel and colon loops are
normal in caliber without evidence of wall thickening. A clip is
again noted in the inferior vena cava, related to pulmonary
embolism prophylaxis. There is no free air.
PELVIS CT WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: There are diverticula in
the sigmoid colon without evidence of diverticulitis. The
bladder and rectum appear unremarkable. The uterus is absent.
There is no free fluid.
BONE WINDOWS: Degenerative changes are again seen in the spine.
CT RECONSTRUCTIONS: Multiplanar reconstructions confirm the
findings demonstrated on the axial images. Value grade is 2.
IMPRESSION:
1. Diverticulosis without evidence of acute diverticulitis.
2. Stable appearance of the dilated pancreatic duct without
evidence of peripancreatic inflammation.

CXR: FINDINGS: AP upright portable view of the chest. The right
internal jugular central venous line terminates in the inferior
portion of the right atrium. It should be pulled back by at
least 7 cm. There is no pneumothorax. There is persistent
elevation of the left hemidiaphragm and associated left lower
lobe atelectasis. The remainder of the lungs are clear. Heart
and mediastinal contours are stable. There is no pulmonary
edema. Surgical changes are noted in the right shoulder.

IMPRESSION:
1. Central venous line malposition with tip in the right atrium,
which should be pulled back by at least 7 cm.
2. Stable left lower lobe atelectasis. No new pulmonary
opacities to suggest pneumonia.

RLE u/s: no DVT


Brief Hospital Course:
A/P:  78 y/o F w/PMR on chronic steroids admitted with diarrhea,
fever, hypotension, elevated lactate and bandemia.
*
1. presented in septic shock; adequately rescussitated in MICU
(code sepsis). Was stable After 10 hours in MICU (no pressors,
just fluid rescusitation and abxs). She was transferred to a
floor bed and was stable for 24 hours. She was changed from
levofloxacin to Zosyn for suspicion of adverse reaction to levo,
having a swollen neck and wheezing. She received benadryl,
pepcid ans [**Last Name (un) **] dose steroids were continued.
.
On the afternoon of [**2200-9-20**], she became confused and combative.
unresponsive. An ABG was drawn which revealed a pH of
7.00/30/167 with lactate of 17. She was given 3 amps of bicarb
and fluids and started on heparin for potential PE (stopped
after initial bolus given). A femoral line was attempted but the
wire could not be threaded. She was given 1 dose of vanco and
gentamycin and the zosyn was continued. Repeat ABG was
7.26/30/259 with a lactate of 9.6. She was transferred to the
MICU.
.
In the MICU, she was found to have a hct of 22. The source of
lactic acidosis was likely due to hyperperfusion from ongoing
sepsis and acute bleed. Given that source of sepsis was not
entirely clear (dirty u/a without urine cx) and with a concearn
for occult bleed, CT abd was repeated. It showed a large
perihepatic bleed. no RP bleed. Labs were consistent with shock
liver. Hepatology was consulted. In their opinion, this was
aspontaneous RP bleed due to shock liver from ongoing sepsis. Pt
was supported with blood products and fluids. [**2-1
