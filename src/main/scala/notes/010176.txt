Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 7539**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest Pain
Acute ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
1. Cardiac Catheterization with placement of 2 drug eluting
stents to LAD


History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 56 yo Male with no known significant cardiac or
medical history who first noted chest pain approximately three
days prior to admission. According to the patient, he has never
in his life experienced chest pain, with exertion or at rest.
However, over the last three days the patient has experienced
bouts of chest pain [**2160-5-26**] that were bandlike across his chest.
This pain was not induced with exercise, was not easily
reproducible, and would usually self terminate after
approximately 30 minutes without specific intervention. The
patient reported these episodes were unpredictable but not
really increasing in frequency or intensity over the last three
days. They were not associated with SOB, radiating pain or
diaphoresis. Of note, yesterday a.m. the patient experienced a
similar episode of pain that self terminated. He then drove to
the gas station and while parked, reports he passed out across
the front wheel for an unknown duration of time. This event was
witnessed by a gas station attendant who called EMS. The patient
denied associated chest pain, SOB, N/V with this event but did
report some associated diaphoresis. The patient recovered from
this event and despite urging from EMS, declined to go to the
hospital and drove home. Early this a.m., around 2:00 a.m. the
patient was woken with similar pain, but more severe than
previous, now rated to be [**7-29**]. Again however the patient denied
associated radiation, SOB, diaphoresis. The patient drove
himself to [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 745**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 66493**] where he was evaluated and found to be
suffering an acute anterior MI.
.
ECG performed at NW was remarkable for atrial bigeminy with ST
elevation in the precordial leads, most pronounced in V2-V4
without any reciprocal depressions (largest, 3-4mm in V2-V3).
Subsequent ECG revealed sinus bradycardia with rate of 57 bpm
and persistent STE in V1-V5. At NW, patient was treated with:
O2, ASA 324mg qd, Hep gtt, Metoprolol, SL NT and transferred to
[**Hospital1 18**].
.
Allergies:
PCN ?????? hives, fever
.
Review of Systems: Patient denies significant limitation at home
physically. He reports he can walk one mile without pain or
shortness of breath. Sleeps with one pillow, stable for years.
Denies PND or significant DOE. Prior to three day stuttering
course of chest pain as above, never suffered chest pain.

Past Medical History:
Obesessive Compulsive Disorder
Depression
Restless Leg Syndrome
s/p appendectomy for perforated appendix - [**2142**]
s/p strabismus surgical repair
s/p trauma R wrist with median nerve injury

COMMENTS:
1. Selective coronary angiography of this left dominant system
revealed a single vessel coronary artery disease. The LMCA had
10% ostial stenosis. The LAD had 99% mid segment stenosis with
TIMI 1 flow. The LCX and RCA had no angiographically significant
coronary artery disease.
2. Resting hemodynamics demonstrated midly elevated right and
left sided pressures (mean RA pressure was 12mmHg, mean PCWP was
19mmHg). There was no evidence of pulmonary hypertension.
Cardiac index was low at 1.6 L/min/m2.
3. Successful treatment of mid-LAD with two overlapping Cypher
drug-eluting stents (3.5 x 23 mm more proximally and 3.0 x 33 mm
more distally). Final angiography demonstrated no residual
stenosis, no angiographically apparent dissection, and normal
flow (See PTCA Comments).
.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Single vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Mild-moderate diastolic dysfunction.
3. Cardiogenic shock.
4. Successful placement of drug-eluting stents in mid-LAD.
