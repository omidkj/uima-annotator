Bilateral LE duplex ([**3-19**])

IMPRESSION:
1. Improvement of thrombotic burden on the left, with now only
focal
non-compressibility of the common femoral vein seen at the level
of the
greater saphenous junction. Note, however, that the left deep
femoral vein
was not well imaged.

2. Redemonstration of extensive right lower extremity deep
venous thrombosis, involving the entirety of the right
superficial femoral vein, popliteal vein, and calf veins. Normal
flow is seen in the right deep femoral vein and right common
femoral vein.

ECHO [**3-15**]: Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of
[**2102-10-3**], [**Last Name (un) 29217**] wall motion abnormality appears similar.
Tricuspid regurgitation is now more prominent and estimated
pulmonary artery pressure is now higher.


Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the Vascular Surgical Service for
evaluation and treatment on [**2107-3-10**]. Upon arrival patient was
started on broad spectrum atbx for his infection. He was
afebrile with stable vital signs.

Left LE: The patient was seen by podiatry upon admission. He was
taken to the operating room on [**2107-3-12**] for washout/debridement by
podiatry. Post-operatively the patient was kept on broad
spectrum atbx and was monitored. The wound was packed with
wet/dry dressings. Ultimately, due to extensive infection and
damage to the lower extremity, the patient underwent a L BKA on
[**2107-3-22**], which went well without complictation. (please see
operative report for further details). Post-operatively, the BKA
site healed well and remained clean, dry, and intact. Atbx were
continued for a few days post-op and then discontinued.

Neuro: The patient received IV dilaudid with good effect and
adequate pain control.  When tolerating oral intake, the patient
was transitioned to oral pain medications with intermittent IV
dilaudid for breakthrough pain. This regimen kept the patient
comfortable during his stay.

CV: The patient remained stable from a cardiovascular
standpoint; vital signs were routinely monitored.

Pulmonary: The patient was doing well initially, but prior to
his scheduled amputation, patient's O2 requirement increased,
and he was noted to be slightly short of breath. Patient has
history of DVTs in the past, so LE duplex was performed. This
showed extensive thrombosis bilaterally. The patient was
promptly started on heparin drip for presumed PEs. Due to his
upcoming amputation, and the inability to be anti-coagulated
post-op, an IVF filter was placed on [**2107-3-21**] for further
protection from PEs. Patient was started on heparin drip after
amputation and this was titrated to a goal PTT of 50-70. He was
transitioned to coumadin with a goal INR of [**1-13**]. His respiratory
status improved throughout his stay and he was weaned off of
oxygen prior to discharge.

GI/GU/FEN: Post-operatively, the patient was initially NPO with
IV fluids. Diet was advanced when appropriate, which was well
tolerated.  Patient's intake and output were closely monitored,
and IV fluid was adjusted when necessary.  Electrolytes were
routinely followed, and repleted when necessary. The patient had
a prior renal transplant. As such, the nephrology service was
involved and dosed his FK levels and other immunosupressants
during his stay. Patient's creatinine was elevated during his
stay, and nephrology felt that this was due to a combination of
cardiorenal syndrome from volume overload and interstitial
nephritis due to nafcillin. The patient's creatinine was closely
monitored. Diuresis was attempted to keep patient fluid
negative. All other nephrotoxins were discontinued. Patient's
kidney function remained stable throughout his stay, and urine
output was okay. Per renal recs he is to have 80mg of lasix
daily upon discharge.

ID: The patient's white blood count and fever curves were
closely watched for signs of infection.   The patient was kept
on broad spectrum atbx until after his amputation. The patient
remained afebrile with stable vital signs. His WBC remained
normal as well.

Endocrine: The patient's blood sugar was closely monitored
during his stay. He was in the 300-400s upon admission. [**Last Name (un) **]
was consulted and patient was started on an insulin drip. He was
transitioned to sliding scale [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) **] recommendations when
blood sugars began to improve. Prior to discharge, patient was
in normal range.

Hematology: The patient's complete blood count was examined
routinely; He received 3 units of blood total during his stay
for low HCT of 22 on [**2107-3-23**] and then a again on [**2107-3-25**]. His
HCT increased appropriately prior to discharge.

At the time of discharge, the patient was doing well, afebrile
with stable vital signs.  The patient was tolerating a regular
diet, voiding without assistance, and pain was well controlled.
The patient received discharge teaching and follow-up
instructions with understanding verbalized and agreement with
the discharge plan.
