Pertinent Results:
[**3-14**] Echo: PRE-BYPASS: The left atrium is moderately dilated.
Moderate to severe spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body
of the left atrium. No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the
body of the right atrium. A left-to-right shunt across the
interatrial septum is seen at rest. A small secundum atrial
septal defect is present. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and
cavity size are normal. Right ventricular chamber size and free
wall motion are normal. There are simple atheroma in the aortic
root. There are simple atheroma in the ascending aorta. There
are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. The aortic
valve leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. There is severe
aortic valve stenosis (valve area 0.8-1.0cm2). Moderate to
severe (3+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are moderately thickened. There is moderate thickening
of the mitral valve chordae. There is severe thickening of the
mitral valve chordae. There is mild valvular mitral stenosis
(area 1.5-2.0cm2). Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion. POST CPB: 1. Preserved
[**Hospital1 **]-ventricular systolic function. 2. Bioprosthetic valve in
aortc position. Well seated, stable and has good leaflet
excursion. 3. No AI, Peak gradient = 18 mm Hg. 4. MR is now
trace to mild. 5. Intact aorta and no other change.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 50183**] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2113-3-12**] for surgical
management of her cardiac disease. She was placed on heparin as
she had been off Coumadin in preparation for surgery. She was
worked-up in the usual preoperative manner. On [**2113-3-14**], she was
taken to the operating room where she underwent right axillary
artery cannulation with and aortic valve replacement and
coronary artery bypass grafting to one vessel. Please see
operative note for details. Postoperatively she was taken to the
intensive care unit for monitoring. Over the next 24 hours, she
awoke neurologically intact and was extubated. She was weaned
from all vasoactive medications.  The EP service interrogated
her pacemaker without changing any settings.  She was later
transferred to the step down unit for further recovery. She was
gently diuresed towards her preoperative weight. Chest tubes and
pacing wires were removed per cardiac surgery protocol. Coumadin
was resumed for her chronic atrial fibrillation and she is to
have an INR drawn on [**3-20**] with results called to the [**Hospital 197**]
Clinic.  She was receiving her home dose of 3 mg po daily.  The
physical therapy service worked with her daily to increase
strength and endurance.  On post operative day 5 she was
tolerating a full oral diet, ambulating without difficulty and
her incisions were healing well.  It was felt that she was safe
for discharge home with visiting nurse services at this time.
