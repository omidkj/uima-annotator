Service:  MICU

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Brought to outside hospital for decreased
urine output.  Transferred to [**Hospital1 188**] for acute myocardial infarction.  Transferred to the
Medical Intensive Care Unit Service for respiratory failure.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 84-year-old
male with diabetes and chronic lymphocytic leukemia, whose
daughter brought him to [**Hospital1 69**]
[**Location (un) 620**] on [**2145-7-24**] because he had not been urinating
during the past day.

In their Emergency Department, he was hypotensive to the 80s
and was started on dopamine.  He was hypoxic to 88% on four
liters.  He had a white blood cell count of 27,000 (with 21%
bandemia).  His creatinine there was 4.5.  A chest x-ray
showed bilateral lower lobe infiltrates.

On [**2145-7-25**] he dropped his blood pressure to the 70s, had
oxygen desaturation, and experienced substernal chest pain,
and had electrocardiogram changes.  He was transferred to the
Coronary Care Unit at [**Hospital1 69**]
[**Location (un) 86**] for further management.

At [**Hospital1 69**], his
electrocardiogram was ventricularly paced at 90 beats per
minute.  His initial troponin was 3 which trended down to 1.
He was continued on dopamine, and antibiotics were changed
from levofloxacin and ceftriaxone.

 1.  Chronic lymphocytic leukemia.
 2.  Non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.

 8.  Coumadin.
 9.  Lipitor 5 mg p.o. once per day.
10.  Prednisone 5 mg p.o. once per day (times one month).

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

FAMILY HISTORY:   Father died at the age of 76 and mother
died at the age of 86 from cardiac conditions.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient has never smoked.  Occasional
social alcohol.  He lives with his wife, daughter,
son-in-law, and grandson in [**Name (NI) 1411**], [**State 350**].

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:   At baseline, during the past year, he is
always tired and sleeping.  He has a very poor appetite.  He
has had a 15-pound weight loss during the past eight months.
His mobility is poor, and he is only able to walk about 15
feet with a walker.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Physical examination
on [**2145-7-26**] revealed blood pressure was 88 to 140/47 to
70, temperature was 99.8, heart rate was 62 to 90, and oxygen
saturation was 98% on 12 liters cool-nebulizer mask.  In
general, he was a pleasant and chronically ill-appearing
male.  Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat examination
revealed the oropharynx was dry.  Chest examination revealed
left-sided crackles one half of the way up.  The right side
was dull to one half of the way up.  There were prominent
expiratory wheezes.  Cardiovascular examination revealed a
regular rate and rhythm.  Normal first heart sounds and
second heart sounds.  A 3/6 systolic murmur.  The abdomen was
soft, nontender, and nondistended.  There were positive bowel
sounds.  Extremity examination revealed 2+ edema to the
ankles.

PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:  Laboratory
values were significant for a white blood cell count of 39.6
(on [**2145-7-26**]).  Creatinine was 4.4 (on [**2145-7-26**]).

PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  A cardiac echocardiogram on
[**2145-7-26**] revealed a left ventricular ejection fraction of
greater than 55%.  The left ventricle was moderately dilated
with severe right ventricular hypokinesis.

HOSPITAL COURSE BY ISSUE/SYSTEM:  The patient was admitted to
the Coronary Care Unit Service.  His troponin levels trended
down, and the elevated troponin levels were felt to be due to
a demand ischemia from hypotension.  He was able to wean off
dopamine on [**2145-7-26**].

Given the large right pleural effusion, a computerized axial
tomography of the chest was performed which showed a large
right-sided loculated pleural effusion.  A bedside chest tube
placement was attempted but was not successful.

Therefore, the patient went to the operating room where a
video-assisted thoracoscopy with decortication and drainage
was performed by the cardiothoracic surgeon.  Three chest
tubes were left in place.

Postoperatively, the patient remained intubated.  He was able
to wean off the ventilator after about four days.  Status
post extubation, he had frequent episodes of mucous plugging
especially at night where he would have significant
desaturations.  He often required deep nasotracheal
suctioning in order to clear these secretions.

In addition, a swallow study was performed which showed that
he had significant aspiration problems and was not safe to
take anything by mouth.  Therefore, a percutaneous endoscopic
gastrostomy tube was placed by Interventional Radiology.

Postoperatively, the patient did have improvement in his
white blood cell count; but again, he had frequent episodes
of plugging.  A computed tomography scan of the chest showed
that he had a large right-sided intraparenchymal lung
abscess.  Given his debilitated condition, he was deemed not
a surgical candidate at this time.  He was continued on
intravenous antibiotics for the abscess.

During the patient's post extubation course he continued to
have a very weak cough, and every day had significant
difficulty attempting to clear his secretions that were
causing hypoxia.  He was extremely debilitated and was too
weak to even get out of bed.

Given his overall extremely poor condition, as well as likely
poor future quality of life, the patient expressed that he
did not wish to continue with further aggressive care.  His
wife and daughter also expressed that if he were to
experience mucous plugging again that the patient not be deep
suctioned but instead that comfort should be his primary
goal.  Several hours thereafter, the patient expired in the
afternoon of [**2145-8-5**].

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Myocardial infarction.
2.  Pneumonia.
3.  Lung abscess.
4.  Empyema with fistula.
4.  Aspiration; requiring percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy
tube platelet count.

PROCEDURES PERFORMED:
1.  Bronchoscopy.
2.  Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube placement.
3.  Video-assisted thoracoscopy with decortication and
placement of three chest tubes.
