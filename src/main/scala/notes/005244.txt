Brief Hospital Course:
A/P:  77 year-old male with alcohol intoxication and elevated
anion gap, lactic acidosis.

1.  Alcohol intoxication - The patient presented after ingesting
a pint of vodka and a 6 pack of beer.  He claims that he does
this about once a month.  He didn't not have any signs of
withdrawal during the hospital stay.  He was maintained
thiamine, folate, and a multivitamin.  Social work was
consulted, but the patient refused referral to services.

2.  Metabolic acidosis - His anion gap was attributed to ethanol
ingestion given that his osmolar gap was normal.  He also had an
elevated lactate to 7.3 on admission, which was attributed to
hypoperfusion in the setting of alcohol ingestion.  The anion
gap resolved and the lactate level decreased with aggressive
fluid resuscitation.  He never had any signs of infections given
that he was afebrile, normal white count, negative CXR and UA.
There was also an initial concern that he may have ischemic
bowel; however, his abdomen was benign and he had non-bloody
stool.

3.  Hypertension - His blood pressure was generally elevated and
typically ranged from 130-170's systolic.  His outpatient
lisinopril was increased from 20 to 40 mg on the day of
discharge.

4.  Emphysema - He oxygenated well on room air throughout the
admission.  He was maintained on his outpatient Atrovent MDI
throughout the admission.

5.  Hyperlipidemia - His Statin was initially held until his
LFTs were normal.

6.  Depression - Initially, there was concern for suicidal
ideation; however, the patient repeatedly denied suicidal and
homicidal ideation.

7. Anemia - His hematocrit dropped after he received aggressive
fluid resuscitation.  This was attributed to hemodilution.

8.  FEN - He was maintained on a low sodium diet.  He was
aggressively fluid resuscitated and his potassium, magnesium,
and phosphate were repleted.

9.  Prophylaxis - He was maintained on subcutaneous heparin,
PPI, and a bowel regimen.

10.  Code - DNR/DNI
