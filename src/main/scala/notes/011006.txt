Service:

HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a [**Age over 90 **]-year-old white
female, who was brought to the emergency room by her daughter
for the chief complaint of chest pain and inability to walk.
The patient reportedly fell down her stairs while living
alone approximately five to seven days prior to admission at
which time she mistook her stairs for being the doorway to
the bathroom.  She reportedly fell approximately six steps.
She was seen in the emergency room at the [**Hospital1 346**] at that time with a chest x-ray
obtained, which was reportedly negative.  She then stayed
with her daughter for the past week, prior to re-admission.
During the past week, the patient has needed assistance with
walking and complained of continued chest-wall pain, as well
as bilateral hip pain.  She reportedly hallucinated briefly
on a narcotic, which was given to her for the pain, but she
has, otherwise, been alert, oriented, with no headache.  She
also reportedly fell approximately one month ago, but details
are unclear from the daughter regarding the fall a month ago.
She denied any neck pain at the time of admission.

PREVIOUS MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  History of mild chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
2.  History of hypertension.
3.  History of pacemaker implant and a prolonged history of
osteoporosis.
4.  History of breast cancer status post left mastectomy in
[**2182-11-11**].
5.  History of mild left leg weakness, previously treated at
a rehabilitation and reportedly getting around well on a
walker.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1.  Zestril.
2.  Celebrex.
3.  Tiazac.

ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  History revealed positive history of tobacco
use in the past.  The patient denied alcohol use.  The
patient had been living alone, but did stay with her daughter
in the past week prior to admission.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On physical examination the patient
was noted to be a well-developed, well-nourished
elderly-appearing female in no acute distress.  Vital signs
were stable with the temperature of 98.7, heart rate 68,
respirations 16, blood pressure 178/84.  Neck was supple.
The entire physical examination, including the head, eyes,
ears, nose, throat, heart, lungs, and abdomen was essentially
unremarkable.  The heart rate was regular rate and rhythm,
resolving ecchymosis of the right side of the face.  There
was neck tenderness and no TLS spine tenderness.  She was
alert and oriented to the [**Hospital1 188**].  She knew that the month was [**Month (only) 404**].  She though
that the year was 2100.  She could not report the months of
the year backwards.  She withdrew all four extremities and
moved all four extremities spontaneously.  There was no
evidence of pronator drift.  The plantar response was
downgoing in bilateral toes.  She was not highly cooperative
for formal strength and sensory testing.  The right pupil was
3-mm reactive to 2.5; the left was reactive to 2.5 to 2.
Extraocular movements were full.  Face was symmetrical.
Tongue and palate were midline.  The CT scan, at the time of
admission, showed bilateral chronic subdural hematomas with a
small component of more acute appearing subdural in the
posterior right frontal area.  White count, at the time of
admission, was 8.0; hematocrit 39.4; platelet count 246,000;
Chem 7 was obtained, which was within normal limits with the
exception of a mildly elevated BUN of 30, creatinine 0.7,
glucose 103, cholesterol 193.  The urinalysis showed greater
than 50 white blood cells, 21 to 50 red blood cells, blood
moderate on dipstick and nitrates negative.

Due to the clinical findings and CT scan findings at the time
of being seen in the ER, the patient was admitted initially
to the Trauma Service on the day of admission [**2183-2-24**].  She remained stable and she was subsequently
transferred to the Neurosurgical Intensive Care Unit.  She
was also transferred to the Neurosurgical Service.  She
remained in the Intensive Care Unit for approximately the
first 48 hours of admission.  She was seen daily in
consultation by the physiotherapist, and occupational therapy
service.  She was transferred out to the floor on the [**2-27**] with continued physiotherapy and occupational
therapy.  The patient was subsequently considered stable
neurologically and yet was noted to require continued
rehabilitation and aggressive physiotherapy.  The patient was
felt not to be safe for home discharge unless there was going
to be a 24-hour caregiver available.  The patient's mental
status remained at baseline level of confusion with decreased
cognition throughout the hospitalization.  Arrangements were
made for the patient to be transferred to a rehabilitation
hospital at the time of discharge.  The plan at the
rehabilitation hospital was to continue with aggressive
physical therapy with the goals of maintaining and achieving
activities of daily living independently.  Arrangements were
made for a CT scan followup to be obtained in approximately
three weeks' time for further followup.  The patient was
subsequently discharged with recommendation that the
rehabilitation hospital and/or family call Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]
office at the [**Hospital 4415**] (as he was the
crosscovering admitting physician for this [**Hospital3 **]
admission).
