HISTORY:  Baby Girl [**Known lastname **] is a newborn 32 and [**5-4**] week twin
admitted to the NICU with prematurity and respiratory
distress. She was born at 1:56 a.m. on [**2154-3-30**], as the
1685 gram product of a 32 and [**5-4**] week twin gestation to a 34-
year-old gravida III, para 0 to II, woman with EDC [**2154-5-21**]. Prenatal labs included blood type O positive, antibody
negative, RPR nonreactive, rubella immune, hepatitis B
surface antigen negative and GBS unknown. Maternal history
was notable for 1 previous TAB and 1 previous ectopic
pregnancy. This pregnancy was notable for IVF assisted di/di
twin gestation with concordant growth. The pregnancy was
complicated by cervical shortening prompting admission from
[**2-20**], through [**3-25**], with betamethasone treatment
at approximately 24 weeks and gestational diabetes-diet
controlled. At clinic visit on [**2154-3-29**], the mother was
noted to have elevated blood pressure and was referred for
evaluation. She was found to have borderline blood pressures
without other evidence of preeclampsia, mild cervical
dilation and irregular contractions and was admitted for
evaluation. Ultrasound showed BPP [**9-4**] twice with normal
amniotic fluid volumes, EFW 31% and 18%, and vertex/breech
presentation.

Early on the morning of delivery, the mother experienced
spontaneous rupture of membranes of twin #1, and was found to
be fully dilated. Due to vertex/breech presentation, she was
taken for urgent C-section. No maternal fever was noted, and
she was not given intrapartum antibiotics. C-section was
performed under general anesthesia. Rupture of membranes had
occurred 1 hour prior to delivery. At delivery, Baby Girl
[**Known lastname **] emerged with moderate tone and weak cry requiring
vigorous stimulation and blow by oxygen. Apgars were 7 and 7
and the infant was brought to the ICU. In the ICU, moderate
work of breathing was noted and the infant was begun on CPAP.

Admission weight was 1685 grams, 25-50th percentile, head
circumference 30 cm, 25-50th percentile, length 45 cm, 50-
75th percentile.

Physical examination at discharge: Vital signs stable. The
baby is [**Name2 (NI) **] and comfortable in an open crib. She appears
nondysmorphic. Clavicles intact. Red reflex present
bilaterally. Mucous membranes moist. Cardiovascular: She has
a regular rate and rhythm. There is a 2/6 systolic benign
sounding murmur which radiates to the back and the axilla
consistent with a PPS murmur. Respiratory: She is comfortable
breathing room air, clear breath sounds on auscultation, no
retractions. Abdominal exam is benign. She is moving all
extremities equally. She is warm and well perfused. Back is
straight, no [**Hospital1 **]. External genitalia is female. Anus is
patent. Tone appears appropriate for age. She is active and
alert with a strong suck and grasp. Hips are stable.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  By systems:
Respiratory: On admission, she was noted to have moderate
work of breathing and started on CPAP. She remained on CPAP
through day of life 5 and was transitioned to room air at
that point. She has remained stable in room air since that
time.

Cardiovascular: She has remained hemodynamically stable. She
has a soft benign sounding murmur which radiates to the
axilla and back. It is most consistent with a peripheral
pulmonic stenosis murmur. Blood pressures have been
reassuring and EKG as well as an x-ray of the chest were also
reassuring.

Fluid, electrolytes and nutrition: She was initially made NPO
due to respiratory distress. Feeds were started on [**2154-4-2**], of breast milk. Feeding volume was gradually advanced.
She reached full feeds by day of life 6. Initially, she was
also on parenteral nutrition which was gradually weaned off
as her feeds reached full volume. She has been gaining weight
on breast milk or special care formula. Maximum calories
attained are formula with 26 calories per ounce. She was
weaned to 24 calorie per ounce feeds prior to discharge and
has continued to grow. At the time of discharge, she has been
taking full p.o. feeds for 72 hours. Screening labs on [**4-25**], showed a calcium of 10, phosphorus of 6.6 and alkaline
phosphatase of 288.

Her weight on the day prior to discharge is 2.73 kilograms
and on the day of discharge ([**2154-5-4**]) her weight was 2745
grams.  Head circumference and length measured on [**2154-4-22**] was 33 cm and 47.5 cm, respectively.

GI: Baby Girl [**Known lastname **] was started on phototherapy on day of
life 2. Initially, the peak bilirubin total was 8.6 and it
gradually decreased on phototherapy. Phototherapy was
discontinued for the first time on [**2154-4-5**]. It was
subsequently restarted with a peak total bilirubin of 10/0.4
on [**2154-4-8**]. Phototherapy was subsequently discontinued
for good on [**2154-4-10**].

Hematology: The patient was started on ferrous sulfate on
[**2154-4-9**]. Her initial hematocrit was 50.6. She was
never transfused.

Infectious disease: She was started on ampicillin and
gentamicin on admission. The antibiotics were discontinued
with blood cultures negative at 48 hours. There have been no
concerns for infection throughout the remainder of
hospitalization.

Neurology: She did not require a screening head ultrasound.
Her exam is nonfocal and reassuring.

Sensory: Audiology hearing screening was performed with
automated auditory brainstem responses prior to discharge and
she passed in both ears.

Ophthalmology: The baby did not require an ophthalmology
exam.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Good.  She was stable with vital
signs within normal limits. She is gaining weight.

DISCHARGE DISPOSITION:  To home.

CARE/RECOMMENDATIONS:
1.  Feeds at discharge will be breast milk or Similac 24
    calories per ounce.
2.  Medications will include ferrous sulfate (concentration 25
    mg/ml) at 2 mg/kg/day which is approximately equivalent
    to 0.25 mL PO once a day.
    Iron and vitamin D supplementation: Iron supplementation
    is recommended for preterm and low birth weight infants
    until 12 months corrected age. All infants fed
    predominantly breast milk should receive vitamin D
    supplementation at 200 international units which may be
    provided as a multivitamin preparation daily until 12
    months corrected age.
3.  Car seat screening performed prior to discharge and she
    passed.
4.  State newborn screens have been sent per protocol and no
    abnormal results have been reported.
5.  Baby Girl [**Known lastname **] received her hepatitis B vaccine on
    [**2154-4-19**].
6.  Immunizations recommended:
    a.  Synagis RSV prophylaxis should be considered from
        [**Month (only) **] through [**Month (only) 958**] for infants who meet any of
        the following 4 criteria: 1. Born at less than 32
        weeks, 2. Born between 32 and 35 weeks with 2 of the
        following: Daycare during RSV season, a smoker in the
        household, neuromuscular disease, airway abnormalities
        or school age sibling, 3. Chronic lung disease or 4.
        Hemodynamically significant CHD.
    b.  Influenza immunization is recommended annually in the
        fall for all infants once they reach 6 months of age.
        Before this age and for the first 24 months of the
        child's life, immunization against influenza is
        recommended for household contacts and out of home
        caregivers.
    c.  This infant has not received Rotavirus vaccine. The
        American Academy of Pediatrics recommends initial
        vaccination of preterm infants at or following
        discharge from the hospital if they are clinically
        stable and at least 6 weeks but fewer than 12 weeks
        of a
