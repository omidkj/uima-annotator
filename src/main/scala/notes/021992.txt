Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1854**]
Chief Complaint:
Brain Lesion: Oligodendroglioma

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Neurosurgery: Right craniotomy for tumor resection [**2104-2-18**]
Vascular surgery: IVC cage placement [**2104-2-21**]


History of Present Illness:
This is a 25 year old man who is a marine who noted left
dysmetria when stationed in Afganistan. He was on leave in
[**State 5864**] and he suffered from one generalized TC convulsion on
[**2104-1-18**]. He had been seizure free on Dilantin since that time. He
underwent an incomplete resection of a right brain lesion in
[**State 5864**] and had a temporary resevoir for the cystic component. He
returned to the east coast and was diagnosed with a PE and had
an IVC filter placed on [**2104-2-8**] at [**Hospital1 18**], Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 23155**]. He saw
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in the [**Hospital 4695**] clinic and he recommended further
decompression of his tumor.

Past Medical History:

Seizure
PE s/p IVC filter [**2104-2-8**]

Social History:
Marine, recently served in Afganistan. Denies tob.
Social EtOH, no other drugs.


Family History:
NC

Physical Exam:
On discharge:

He is alert and oriented to person, place, and time. [**Last Name (LF) 2994**], [**First Name3 (LF) 2995**]
[**5-21**], no pronator drift. Head incision is C/D/I, dissolveable
sutures. He is OOB and ambulating.

Pertinent Results:
CT head [**2104-2-18**]:
Subtotal resection of right oligodendroglioma, with residual
postoperative hemorrhage. Recommend MRI to assess for residual
tumor bulk.

MRI brain [**2104-2-19**]:
1. Subtotal resection of right oligodendroglioma, with residual
surrounding tumor.
2. Post-resection central and subdural hemorrhage.
3. Acute infarct versus post-surgical cytotoxic edema in
superior right
frontal lobe.
4. Unchanged inferior cerebellar tonsillar displacement.

LENS [**2104-2-20**]:
Non-occlusive thrombus in the right iliac vein.

CTA chest [**2104-2-21**]:
1. Extensive new pulmonary emboli in the right lower lobe artery
and
posterior/lateral segmental arteries of the right lower lobe.
2. Associated pleural effusion, atelectasis, and likely
pulmonary infarction in the right lung base.
3. Apparent resolution of left lower lobe pulmonary embolus.
4. Mild right hilar lymphadenopathy.

CTA/V abdomen [**2104-2-21**]:
1. Small right pleural effusion with adjacent right lower lobe
atelectasis
and likely pulmonary infarction, as seen on earlier same day CTA
chest.
2. IVC filter in place as noted above, with the superior tip of
the filter
1.3 cm below the lowest renal vein.
3. Large IVC clot burden seen extending from the confluence of
the iliac
veins, through the infrarenal IVC filter, and extending
superiorly beyond the tip of the IVC filter for 3.2 cm, just
beyond the level of the inferior renal vein. Of note, iliac
veins below the iliac crests are not assessed.
4. Stranding along the right iliac vessels and the lower IVC
likely due to
thrombosis.

CT head [**2104-2-22**]:
Stable post-op CT. Increased vasogenic edema noted.

Bil. Upper Ext US [**2104-2-22**]:
IMPRESSION: Distal left basilic vein thrombus.

CT Head [**2104-2-23**]:
IMPRESSION: Stable post-surgical changes from the partial
resection of the
large right frontal mass.

Ct L-spine [**2104-2-23**]:
1. No fractures or alignment abnormalities.
2. Retroperitoneal stranding, could be related to chronic venous
thrombosis with a potential non-occlusive thrombus in the left
common iliac vein, subptimally evaluated in non-contrast
setting.

CT Abdomen/pelvis [**2104-2-26**]:




Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 9449**] was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2104-2-18**]. He was taken to the
OR by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for a stereotactic approach to further
decompression of right sided lesion previously classified at
oligodendroglioma. Post-op imaging was consistent with surgery
and continued midline shift. He was monitored closely in the
PACU overnight without event. He was on Decadron with plan to
taper after 2 days to 4mg Q6hrs. HE was on Mannitol with a 2 day
taper. Floor orders were written on [**2104-2-19**] as he was
neurologically intact. SQ heparin was started.

He had a fever to 101.2 on [**2104-2-20**]. LENS studies showed
Non-occlusive thrombus in the right iliac vein. He already had
an IVC filter. Hematology was consulted. They were considering
future Lovenox use. He developed midsternal chest pain overnight
into [**2104-2-21**]. CTA chest was ordered.

There was a question of an iodine allergy when the CTA was
ordered. The history is as follows. He was started on Dilantin
in early [**Month (only) 404**]. He developed a PE and had an IVC filter placed
on [**2-8**]. He had contrast during this admission. He developed a
truncal rash later in the week and took Benadryl. His rash
recently resolved when we transitioned him to Keppra and Dc'ed
the Dilantin. He never had an anaphylactic reaction. The time
course for the development of the rash seems more consistent
with a Dilantin rash than an iodine allergy. After discussions
with the radiology department, he was cleared for the CTA. CTA
showed extensive right PE. Vascular surgery was re-consulted.
They recommended bilateral UE LENS and a CTV of the abdomen to
evaluate patency and placement. Transferred to the SDU with
telemetry and continuous O2 saturation was initiated.

CTA/CTv of the abdomen showed that the IVC filter was no longer
patent. He was taken to the OR with vascular surgery and a cage
was placed. He was started on a heparin drip for a goal PTT of
40. No bolus was given as he was at high risk for ICH. HE was
transferred to the SICU for Q1 hr neuro checks.

On [**2104-2-22**] he was neurologically intact. He continued to have
midline LBP thought to be a result of immobility. Imaging was
deferred in the acute ICU setting. Flexeril was prescribed.  CT
head in the morning showed increase in vasogenic edema but
stable.

On [**2104-2-23**] Lumbar spine CT was done and was negative for any
fractures or malalignment. Coumadin was started.  On [**2104-2-24**] he
was transferred to the floor and was walking the halls. He
remained on the Heparin drip and his Coumadin dosing was
increased. On [**2104-2-25**] his coumadin was discontinued per
Hematology. On [**2-26**] his PTT was 80 and his heparin was held.
Follow up PTT was 30 and hematology recommended starting Heparin
again at 2100 with Coumadin 5mg QHS. CTA Abdomen/Pelvis to
evaluate the cage/filter showed no new thrombus.
He has a recurrence of CP during the afternoon of [**2-26**]. His VS
were stable and he was not complaining of SOB. IT was similar in
quality to pain that he had previously. A chest X-ray was
ordered. This showed no acute pulmonary issues. His heparin was
discontinued the evening of [**2104-2-26**]. Lab work on [**2-27**] showed INR
2.8 PTT 30. Hematology cleared him for DC on [**2104-2-27**]. Vascular
surgery cleared him for discharge on [**2104-2-27**] as well and he was
discharged to home.
