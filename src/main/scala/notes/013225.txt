pseudomonas in sputum.  He was started on high dose
corticosteroids and standing nebs with q1 hour suctioning.  PICC
line was placed.  He was attempted to be weaned to po prednisone
but he did not feel comfortable, so was d/c with IV solumedrol.

Brief Hospital Course:
1. Lethargy/COPD: elevated pCO2 at admission, patient connected
to ventilator the night of admission, but disconnected am
[**2126-6-20**].  It is possible his hypercarbia is related to his
capped tracheostomy and/or a component of sleep apnea related to
his underlying tracheobronchomalacia and hemi-diaphragm
paralysis.  Since his disconnection from the ventilator, his
tracheostomy has remained uncapped at night with trach collar,
and he has continued on 1-3L nasal cannula. It is possible that
he may have a component of obesity/hypoventilation syndrome. His
primary pulmonologist recommended an outpatient sleep study,
which has been ordered. The pt will be contact[**Name (NI) **] with an
appointment. CXR showed questionable infiltrate, and pt was
started on empiric Meropenem/Vancomycin for presumed
tracheobronchitis. Sputum culture grew only sparse Pseudomonas,
and pt is likely colonized given his history of multi-drug
resistant Pseudomonas and MRSA. Hence, PICC order and
antibiotics were discontinued prior to discharge. Pt remained
afebrile throughout his stay. Pt was initiated on Prednisone
30mg PO daily ([**6-21**]), and steroids were tapered by 5mg daily to
ultimately 20mg daily at discharge. Per primary pulmonologist,
Dr. [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) 4507**], pt will continue on 20mg daily for a least one
week, and dose should then be decreased to alternating 20mg/15mg
daily as tolerated. Pt was placed on standing Ipratropium nebs
q6h, and Albuterol nebs q4 PRN. He has an appoi
