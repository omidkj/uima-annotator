History of Present Illness:
Pt is 67 y/o woman with PMH of CAD, last echo [**2172-12-22**] showing EF
60% with 13mm aortic valve with h/o aortic stenosis, HTN, Type
II DM complicated by diabetic neuropathy, retinopathy, h/o ESRD
on HD (three times per week, last dialyzed on [**2172-11-29**]), h/o L
fem-[**Doctor Last Name **] bypass s/p L BKA for severe PVD, h/o right heel foot
ulcer, h/o indwelling dialysis cathether growing MRSA recently
and subsequent left IJ placed for HD, h/o multiple line
infections and infections of dialysis catheter sites with MRSA,
who presented to [**Hospital3 **] on [**2172-12-12**] with CC of [**10-26**],
sharp, low back pain and fever.  Blood cultures drawn
demonstrated gram positive cocci in pairs and clusters.  A TEE
was attempted but she desatted and was felt to be 'unstable.'  A
TTE was inconclusive, but given her harsh systolic murmur and
blood cultures, was presumed to have endocarditis.  She was
started on Zithromax, and CTX originally on admission, and after
blood cultures came back positive on [**2172-12-20**], she was started on
IV vancomycin w/ d/c of zithromax.  It appears she was in the
ICU during her stay at [**Hospital1 46**] X 1 week then transferred to
medical floor.  Her back pain continued to worsen despite abx.
MRI of the spine revealed L3-L4 discitis, osteomyelitis with
epidural abscess and cauda equina compression with probable
multiple lumbar radiculopathy.  She was seen by NSGY who felt
her unstable to have the procedure done at [**Hospital3 3583**],
given her PMH.  Vascular surgery accepted her here at [**Hospital1 18**] for
transfer.  She was admitted yesterday to vascular service, made
NPO, IVF, Vanco X1, levoflox and metonidazole started, and spine
consulted with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 363**] attending.  Renal was also consulted,
and she was dialyzed on [**2172-12-29**].

.
Recent Imaging:
CXR [**1-31**]:
1.  No evidence of pulmonary edema.
2.  Right middle and lower lobe opacities, which may relate to
pneumonia given the history of bacteremia.  Adjacent pleural
effusion.
3.  Right PICC line now terminates within the right subclavian
vein near junction with brachiocephalic vein.
.
CT head [**2083-1-29**]:
1.  No evidence of intracranial hemorrhage.
2.  Ongoing evolution of prior infarction in the right occipital
lobe.
3.  Questionable blurring of the [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter
differentiation in the posterior right sylvian fissure, which
may represent an area of new acute infarction.
4.  Sinus disease
.
MRI head [**2173-1-30**]: Except for nonvisualization of the distal
portion of the right posterior cerebral artery, no other
abnormalities are seen on the MRA of the head.

Brief Hospital Course:
In summary, patient is a 67 y/o woman with hx of CAD (EF 60%),
AS (AV 1.3 cm2), HTN, DM2 c/b diabetic neuropathy, retinopathy,
h/o ESRD on HD, severe PVD s/p L BKA, admitted from OSH with
MRSA bacteremia [**2-18**] HD line infection, also with back pain and
fevers. Patient treated with Azithromycin and Ceftrixone then
changed to IV Vanco. Also ?BE given murmur on exam, TEE
inconclusive. Back pain persisted despite Antx treatment, MRI
performed which showed L3-L4 discitis, osteomyelitis w/epidural
abscess and cauda equina compression. Patient was then
transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management, admitted to vascular
surgery, treated with IVF, Vanco, Levo, Flagyl, and spine
service consulted (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 363**]. Renal was also consulted, and
dialysis initiated. Ortho and general [**Doctor First Name **] were consulted for
her spinal abscess and psoas abscess respectively. Patient was
taken to the OR on [**12-31**] for a total laminectomy of L2, L3 and
L4, as I&D of epidural abscess, which later grew out coag
positive staph. On [**1-1**], IR drained the psoas abscess with
removal of 30cc of fluid, gram stain showing 2+PMNs, no bact,
culture growi
