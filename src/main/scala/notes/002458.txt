Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 11291**]
Chief Complaint:
Increased seizure frequency

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
31RHM with global developmental delay and intractable epilepsy
with complex partial and secondary generalised seizures
secondary to bilateral nodular periventricular heterotopias on 4
AEDs at baseline presents with seizure clusters in the setting
of a likely URI possibly viral similar to his previous admission
in 10/[**2116**].

Patient has a somewhat similar presentation to his recent
admission in [**9-1**]-7/[**2116**]. At that point, his last cluster had
not been for over 1 year and had one additional admission to
[**Hospital3 **] in setting of PNA and flu and was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] for
seizures in [**2112**]. Since then there has been  He has never been
in status epilepticus or admitted to ICU/intubated for seizures.


Patient had been unwell with nasal congestion and a cough for
the past 1 week. He had a CXR which was apparently negative and
received Flonase which improved symptoms and has a mild residual
cough. This seems to be a common precipitant for seizures. He
also had "low grade fevers" to low 99s per mother and apparently
small increases in temperature from his baseline of 97.5F can
also lower seizure threshold. His mother also noticed at times
that he was sweating.

His seizures started on Friday having had no seizures for
perhaps over 1 month. He had two brief typical seizures on going
to bed on Friday [**4-29**] and then had two more brief (up to 30s)
seizures on Saturday morning. Then by 14:30 on [**4-30**] he started
having a cluster and was having seizures every 5-10 minutes. He
would also have breaks when he would not seize for an hour or
two then go
back to seizing. For his seizures, his mother gave him 6mg
diazepam x1 on [**4-30**]. He also had a seizure while in a chair when
he fell and hit his head sustaining a small bruise around his
left eye. He slept through the night seizure free until [**5-1**] at
0300 when he started having a further cluster of seizures every
5-10 minutes and lasting up to 30-45s each. He was given 10mg po
diazepam then there was a gap of [**1-30**] hours when it appeared that
his seizures had stopped but then recurred at 7-7:30pm when he
had a further persistent cluster of similar duration and hit his
chin against a wastebasket falling out of bed around this time.
After a further 5mg po diazepam at home, EMS were called and he
was taken to [**Hospital3 **] Hospital.

At [**Hospital3 **] Hospital, he was noted to have seizures every [**4-7**]
minutes and was loaded with IV valproate 500mg and given a
further 10mg diazepam (5mg IV and 5mg po). Vitals were stable at
OSH and BP on transfer was 96/53. Had a CT head scan there was
reported as normal.

On transfer to [**Hospital1 18**], he was noted to be seizing every [**1-31**]
minutes brief 10-20s episodes of his typical seizures involving
rolling from left to right and moving legs and writhing arms,
neck will extend and will occasionally grunt and slightly foam
at the mouth. On resolution of his seizure, he will return back
to
baseline. He was also hypotensive to SBP 80 after 2mg IV
midazolam and 200mg IV vimpat. This was treated with IVF and
eventually recovered to the 90s with lowest recorded SBP 70s
although on repeat this was 80. He was never symptomatic with
his hypotension. Given persistence of seizures he was due to
receive a further 200mg IV vimpat in the ED but as this was not
ready from pharmacy had to be given in the ICU. Due to concerns
regarding possible infection he was treated with IV ceftriaxone
2g empirically.

Typical semiology is described below and involves often starting
with a warning gutteral noise and then proceeding to flailing of
the legs and arms some times with head turn to the right, back
can arch and neck extends, his pupils dilate and extends his
neck stares and looks up and eyes roll and latterly can make
further grunting noises and then after a duration of currently
up to 30-45s (at most up to 90s and only once had a prolonged 10
minute episode at the time of seizure diagnosis of 10 minutes).
Please see below for prior semiologies. With me, he was having
seizures as described every 3-5 minutes and lasting [**9-17**]
seconds with return of consciousness in between which is
typical. His last
seizure was more than 1 month ago but he can have sporadic
seizures, generally at least once per month in the setting of
any intercurrent illness. Post-ictally he is briefly tired and
his speech can be slurred or has difficulty getting the words
out although this is transient and only lasts maximum 23 minutes
until he is back to baseline.

He walks, talks in simple sentences and needs partial assistance
with dressing and assistance toileting and bathing and can feed
himself. Full details under social history.

Currently, patient is drowsy appropriately and patient was noted
to be coughing slightly not productive and with nasal
congestion. He was not sweaty but was pale. Now with complex
partial seizures every 3-5 minutes lasting currently 10-20s.

On neuro [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] mother, the pt denied headache, loss of
vision,
blurred vision, diplopia, dysphagia, lightheadedness, vertigo,
tinnitus or hearing difficulty. Denies new difficulties
producing
or comprehending speech. Denied focal weakness, numbness,
parasthesiae. No bowel or bladder incontinence or retention.
Denies new difficulty with gait.

On general review of systems, per mother the pt denied chills.
No
night sweats but motehr did note sweating no recent weight loss
or gain. Denied shortness of breath. Denied chest pain.  Denied
nausea, vomiting, constipation or abdominal pain. Per motehr had
one episode of loose stools and Rx with immodium. No recent
change in bladder habits.  No dysuria. Denied arthralgias or
myalgias. Denies rash.

Past Medical History:
Recent epilepsy history:
At his last admission, this presentation was similar with a
likely URI prodrome of cough and congestion without fevers or
chills leading to clusters of typical seizures with return to
his
mental status baseline in between events. At that point had
received significant diazepam (20mg) as has significant
paradoxcal behavioural problems with lorazepam. As below, at
that
time, he was started on standing diazepam 5 mg q6hr, Banzel dose
increased to 400 mg [**Hospital1 **]. He did not have too much benefit from
these changes and continued to seizure approximately 3-5 times
per hour. Due to his extensive history of allergic reactions to
antiepileptics, he was loaded with Vimpat as he was naive to
this
medication. His seizures were significantly more controlled on
this medication within just 3 days. He was discharged on a
diazepam taper and off vimpat.

Previous semiologies:

1) Drop attacks - where he will sudenly drop withouut warning to
the floor
2) Complex partial - rolling and staring with eyes rolling
upwards and per documentation at last admission also involved
head turning to the right which is usual and also with back
arching, tonic flexion of arms with kicking movements of legs.
3) GTC - more vigorous form of above with violent clonic shaking
of all 4 limbs
4) Staring spells which can last perhaps only 2 seconds


PMH:
- epilepsy: diagnosed age 18 though was likely having
undiagnosed seizures since childhood [**12-30**] bilateral nodular
periventricular heterotopias (thus Phase I evaluation at CHB was
aborted)
- Past anticonvulsants tried include Dilantin, tried about 8
years ago, which led to retained fluids and a high fever.
Tegretol was apparently never used because it was said that he
should not be on Tegretol due to a Dilantin cross reaction.
Phenobarbital and lorazepam have both led to "crazy behavior" in
the past, according to the mother.  [**Name (NI) 51350*
