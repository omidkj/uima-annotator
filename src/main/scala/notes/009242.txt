Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 106**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of Breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac catheterization [**2148-9-25**] and [**2148-9-30**]
IR guided PICC line [**2148-9-26**]


History of Present Illness:
45 y/o female with known CAD s/p CABG [**2140**] presenting to [**Hospital1 18**]
upon transfer from [**Hospital1 34**] for shortness of breath.  She was
recently admitted to [**Hospital1 34**] (discharged on [**9-17**]) with CHF and
eventually transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for management. She was
medically managed and discharged home. This most recent episode
began two nights ago.  She had some shortness of breath that
resolved after she took her home dose of lasix (20mg).  Denied
any symptoms over the day yesterday but then  woke up over night
and felt quite short of breath. She took 20mg PO lasix but said
she "could not urinate".  Symptoms progressively worsened so she
called 911 and was taken to [**Hospital1 34**]. Upon arrival to [**Hospital1 34**], O2 sat was
80% with rapid respirations.  The patient was started on CPAP
and sats increased to 100%. The patient was also given 20mg IV
lasix at [**Hospital1 34**].  Remained pain free.  Then transferred for cardiac
catheterization.  Prior to transfer to [**Hospital1 18**] the patient was
changed to non rebreather and was satting 98-100%.
.
Upon arrival to [**Hospital1 18**], patient underwent cardiac cath, which
showed no changes from her previous cath.  No intervention
performed given results.  ECHO today: "compared with the prior
study (images reviewed) of [**2148-9-3**], the inferolateral wall
systolic dysfunction is more evident and the severity of mitral
regurgitation has decreased slightly."
.
Upon arrival to CCU, patient was comfortable.  Reported
improvement of her symptoms but still was requiring
non-rebreather.  Satting 96%.  Denies any chest pain, syncope,
headaches or dizziness.  VS: BP- 102/45, HR- 78, RR- 17, O2- 96%
on NRB.
.
On review of systems, she denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. She denies recent fevers, chills or
rigors. She denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the
other review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, ankle edema,
palpitations, syncope or presyncope.  Reports orthopnea and
shortness of breath.

Pertinent Results:
Cardiac Cath [**2148-9-25**]:
COMMENTS:
1. Coronary angiography in this right dominant system revealed
diffuse multivessel coronary artery disease.  The LMCA had no
significant
stenosis.  The LAD had a 70% mid-portion stenosis after the D1
branch
with competitive flow from a patent LIMA that filled the distal
vessel.
The LCX had severe diffuse disease in the mid-portion extending
into a
distal branching OM that was unchanged compared with prior caths
in [**2145**]
and [**2141**] performed after known SVG-OM occlusion.  The RCA was
not
injected.  The SVG-->R-PDA was patent with filling of a
diffusely
diseased distal RCA.  The LIMA-LAD was patent.
2. Resting hemodynamics performed on intravenous nitroglycerine
revealed
slightly [**Year (4 digits) **] left and right filling pressures with mean RA
pressure
of 10 mmHg and mean PCWP of 15 mmHg.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Diffuse coronary artery disease.
2. Slightly [**Year (4 digits) **] left and right filling pressures on IV
nitroglycerine.
.
Cardiac echo [**2148-9-25**]:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The estimated right atrial
pressure is 0-5 mmHg. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is mild regional left
ventricular systolic dysfunction with inferolateral hypokinesis
and distal anterior hypokinesis. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%). The estimated
cardiac index is high (>4.0L/min/m2). Transmitral Doppler
imaging is consistent with Grade II (moderate) LV diastolic
dysfunction. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally
normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis. No
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Moderate
(2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. The end-diastolic pulmonic
regurgitation velocity is increased suggesting pulmonary artery
diastolic hypertension.
.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2148-9-3**], the
inferolateral wall systolic dysfunction is more evident and the
severity of mitral regurgitation has decreased slightly.
.
Cardiac Cath [**2148-9-30**]:
1. Limited angiography in this right dominant system
demonstrated multi
vessel disease. The LCx was diffusely diseased in the mid to
distal
vessel. The RCA was not injected.
2. Successful PTCA of the LCx with a 2.0
