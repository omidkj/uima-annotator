Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 832**]
Chief Complaint:
Abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation/Sedation to allow medical care early in hospital
course

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 90100**] is a 24 year-old woman with recent diagnosis of SLE
vs possible Crohn's on steroid taper and pervasive development
disorder (resides in a group home) who presents with worsening
abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.  She was noted
to be vomiting starting last night.  She has been having
diarrhea, no BRBPR or melena. The mother feels that she is in
pain as she brings her knees up to her chest. She was doing very
well since [**Month (only) 404**] until 2 weeks ago when she developed
nausea/vomiting thought to be from Plaquenil. This was changed
to Azathioprine a few days ago at 25mg. Her Prednisone was
increased to 10mg.  Her symptoms began this weekend as above.
Howevever, her symptoms are different than in [**Month (only) 404**], given her
emesis is clear and she is having watery diarrhea.  Per her
mother, there is no reported fever/chills, CP/SOP/ cough, or
rash.  She also denies recent sick contacts.

She was seen at Health Alliance this morning at 3 AM. CT showed
no obstruction but diffuse colitis.  Pt received zofran, reglan
(with benadryl), and hydrocortisone 100mg prior to transfer.

In the ED, initial VS were: 98 106 122/90 14 99%.  Exam was
notable for soft abdomen, guaiac negative.  Labs were notable
for WBC 8.5. ESR, CRP pending.  GI was consulted.  Currently she
is doing well with no clear abdominal pain.

Past Medical History:
- SLE vs Crohns Disease, followed by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 679**] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1667**].
Admitted [**12-29**] for colitis/SBO.  Improved on steroids.  Imuran
also started.
- Pervasive developmental disorder
- OCD
- Bipolar disorder
- Question of seizure disorder

Social History:
She is single, lives in a group home in [**Location (un) 16843**], with
visitations from the family on weekends. She does not smoke,
does not drink.

Family History:
There is a family history of colitis, Crohn's, ADHD, Tourette's
and Asperger's in the family.

Physical Exam:
VS: T 98.2, BP 104/75, HR 111, RR 16, 100%RA
Gen: well appearing, smiling, NAD
HEENT: anicteric sclera, MMM, OP clear
Neck: supple no LAD
Heart: Tachy, regular, no m/r/g
Lung: CTAB though exam limited by cooperation
Abd: soft NT/ND +BS no rebound or guarding
Skin: no obvious rashes though exam limited by cooperation
Ext: no pitting edema, warm
Neuro: alert, non-verbal, smiles and reactive.  Would no
cooperate with rest of exam.

Pertinent Results:
LABS:

C3: 94
C4: 8
Anti dsDNA: negative
Beta-2-Glycoprotein Ab: IgM elevated; IgG and IgA normal

C. diff PCR: Negative
Sputum [**2123-4-8**]: +MSSA, +EColi
Blood Cx [**2123-4-8**]: +Coagulase negative staph aureus
Urine Cx [**2123-4-8**]: +EColi

CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST [**2123-4-7**]:
1. Diffuse colitis, infectious, inflammatory, or vasculitis
etiologies should be considered. There is associated abdominal
ascites, and small bowel dilatation.
2. Small bowel acute on chronic inflammatory change with dilated
loops and
wall edema. Favor inflammatory vs. vasculitis, though findings
are not
specific for either. No small bowel transition point is seen to
suggest a
mechanical bowel obstruction, and any component of partial
obstruction is
likely to be functional as the result of inflammation.
3. No CT signs of vasculitis of the abdominal vessels and no
arterial or
venous occlusion.
4. Small right pleural effusion.

SIGMOIDOSCOPY [**2123-4-8**]:
- Moderately severe colitis with likely pseudomembrane in the
sigmoid and descending colon (biopsy, biopsy)
- Loss of vascularity in the rectum
- Internal hemorrhoids
- Otherwise normal sigmoidoscopy to splenic flexure

RECS: Await pathology report. Likely C.diff colitis, but cannot
rule-out Crohn's disease based on endoscopic appearance alone.
Send stool studies for C.diff toxin/PCR, and would initiate
empiric therapy for C.diff colitis with PO/PR Vancomycin. Would
recommend against increasing steroid therapy for now given the
concern and high likelihood for C.diff colitis, unless
histologic evaluation appears otherwise.

SIGMOID AND DESCENDING COLON BIOPSIES:
- Colonic mucosa with abundant surface mucin (highlighted by
mucicarmine stain).
- No pseudomembranes, vasculitis, or cryptitis seen (additional
levels were examined).

PORTABLE ABDOMEN [**2123-4-12**]:
Unchanged prominent loops of small bowel with some contrast seen
in the
ascending as well as descending colon likely representing
essentially
unchanged partial small bowel obstruction

Brief Hospital Course:
24 year-old woman with SLE, pervasive developmental disorder,
who presented with nausea and vomiting feculant material [**1-20**]
recurrent ileus vs. partial SBO associated with a probable
vasculitis-induced colitis. Management is complicated by
behavioral issues (pulling out all lines), requiring sedation
and intubation to enable medical management.  Decompression with
[**Last Name (un) **]-gastric tube was performed. CT demonstrated bowel wall
thickening suggestive of colitis. C.diff toxin and C.diff PCR
were negative. Given patient's h/o lupus, there was concern for
a possible vasculitic process.  Patient was started on a course
1000 mg Methylprednisolone x3d followed by a taper. Of note,
azathioprine, which she had been on for lupus treatment, was
transiently held. Flex [**Last Name (un) 65**] was performed to determine the
etiology of colitis.  Biopsies were non-dagnostic and did not
demonstrate signs of vasculitis, cryptitis or psuedomembranes.
Nonetheless, it was the opinion of the rheumatology consult
service that this likely represent vasculitis-associated colitis
and her symptoms improved with ongoing prednisone and restarted
azathioprine use. The patient will continue on 30mg daily of
prednisone and 75mg daily of azathioprine with calcium, vitamin
d, atovaquone prophylaxis with weekly blood draws for
azathioprine toxicity monitoring. She will follow-up with
rheumatology in approximately 1 week. Symptomatically the
patient had significant improvement with apparent improvement in
abdominal pain and distention.

He hospital course was complicated by pneumonia, with sputum
growing out GI flora consistent with aspiration PNA, as well as
UTI with EColi.  She was treated with Meropenem for 8 days
([**Date range (1) **]).  Treatment with Vancomycin was planned for 14 days
([**Date range (1) 90101**]), but the patient pulled out her IV access and was
converted to PO Linezolid.  The patient will reufse PO meds
sometimes, so because of clinical stability and difficulty with
administering IV or PO meds, treatment for Coag-neg staph was
stopped at 12 days (stopped [**4-21**]).

Ms. [**Known lastname 90100**] was followed by Psychiatry during her admission for
behavioral issues and developmental disorder. In addition to her
Klonopin she received PRN Valium.

On [**4-23**], she was noted to have increased agitation and stated she
had abdominal pain. She was also unable to void. Foley catheter
was placed which found the bladder to be retaining 900cc urine.
She was given a voiding trial on [**4-25**] and failed, so Foley
catheter was replaced. Subsequently the patient pulled her foley
catheter and repeat post-void residual measurement revealed
<100cc residual on multiple repeat measurements. It appears that
the patient's urinary retention resolved. She has no signs of
ongoing urinary difficulty. For recurrent abdominal complaints
or changes in urinary patterns, this issue should be
re-investigated.

The patient had signs of a significant fungal infection of the
perineum and intercrural region. Attempts were made at treating
this with antifungal powder however the patient intermittently
refused
