Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 922**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2125-10-8**] - Coronary bypass grafting x4 with left internal mammary

the first diagonal coronary; reverse saphenous vein graft from

[**2125-10-4**] - Cardiac Catheterization

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 107057**] is an 85 year-old male with history of hypertension,
hypercholesterolemia, colorectal cancer s/p hemicolectomy in
[**2125-7-8**] admitted following cardiac catheterization for left
main disease where patient was found to have 80% blockage of
left main. The patient was admitted for cardic surgery
evaluation and further managment.
.
For more than three months, Mr. [**Known lastname 107057**] has experienced exertional
substernal chest pain for more than three [**Last Name (un) 94303**], that is worse
after eating a large meal. He initially attributed his symptoms
to indigestion because his symptoms were relieved by burping and
he did not seek out medical treatment. He underwent an exercise
tolerance test on [**2125-9-24**] where he exercised for four
minutes achieving 89% of his predicted max heart rate without
anginal symptoms. The resting EKG showed voltage for LVH. There
was also 2-[**Street Address(2) 79078**] depression noted. The nuclear
portion shows a fixed perfusion abnormality at the inferolateral
wall with mild hypokinesis of the inferior wall and an LVEF of
54%.
.
Of note, he had a post surgery chest CT recently that revealed a
right upper lobe lung mass and a 1cm hilar adenopathy. He is now
referred for a cardiac catheterization with a possible radial
approach given the possibility of a future pulmonary diagnostic
procedure.
.
On the floor the patient feels well post catheterization. He
denies chest pain, shortness of breath, bleeding from the
catheterization site.
.
On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains,
cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools. He denies recent
fevers, chills or rigors. He denies exertional buttock or calf
pain. All of the other review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,
ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

PULSES:

Pertinent Results:
[**2125-10-8**] ECHO
Pre CPB: No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the
body of the left atrium or left atrial appendage. No atrial
septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular
wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. There are
simple atheroma in the aortic arch. There are complex (>4mm)
atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. There is no aortic
valve stenosis. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. There is
calcification of the aortic valve resulting in incomplete
opening between the LEFT and NON coronary cusps, although this
does not result in significant stenosis, there is mild aortic
insufficiency which originates at this same location and has a
central component. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial
mitral regurgitation is seen. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 914**] was notified in person
of the results. Post CPB: Left ventricular systolic function
continues to be normal. Trivial mitral regurgitation and mild
aortic regurgitation persist. The thoracic aorta is intact.

[**2125-10-5**] Carotid Ultrasound
Significant plaque with a right 70-79% carotid stenosis. On the
left there is less than 40% stenosis.

[**2125-10-4**] Cardiac Catheterization
1. Selective coronary angiography in this right dominant system
demonsratrated left main and three vessel coronary artery
disease.  The
LMCA had a distal 80-90% stenosis that extended into an 80%
stenosis of
the proximal LAD.  The LCX was 100% stenosed proximally.  The
RCA was
100% stenosed in the proximal vessel with a network of bridging
right to
right collaterals providing distal blood flow.  There were also
right to
left collaterals.
2. Limited resting hemodynamics revealed moderate systemic
arterial
systolic hypertension with SBP 153 mmHg.  The left ventricular
filling
pressure with elevated with LVEDP 15mmHg.
3. There was no evidence of aortic stenosis on careful pullback
of the
JR catheter from the left ventricle to the ascending aorta.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 107057**] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2125-10-4**] following his
cardiac catheterization which revealed severe left main disease.
Heparin was started as he had a known pulmonary embolism. Given
the severity of his disease, the cardiac surgical service was
consulted for surgical evaluation. He was worked up in the usual
preoperative manner including a carotid ultrasound which
revealed a 70-79% right internal carotid artery stenosis and a
less then 40% stenosis on the left. On [**2125-10-8**], Mr. [**Known lastname 107057**] was
taken to the operating room where he underwent coronary artery
bypass grafting to 4 vessels. Please see operative note for
details. Postoperatively he was taken to the intensive care unit
for monitoring. Over the next several hours, he awoke
neurologically intact and was extubated. On postoperative day
one, he was transferred to the step down unit for further
recovery. Mr. [**Known lastname 107057**] was gently diuresed towards his preoperative
weight. The physical therapy service was consulted for
