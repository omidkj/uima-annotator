History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 80994**] is a 68-year-old
gentleman with a locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer.
His initial mediastinal staging via mediastinoscopy was done
at an outside institution and was negative for any
mediastinal metastatic nodal disease. He was initially
thought to be unresectable due to mediastinal involvement
with the proximal central tumor but he had a marked response
to chemo radiation and therefore presented for resection. His
restaging with PET and head MRI was negative for advance
disease.

chemotherapy and radiation, HTN, COPD, Depression, Anxiety

CXR:
[**2166-2-25**] Heart size is normal. The mediastinum is shifted to the
left due to left upper lobe lobectomy. No obvious pneumothorax
has been demonstrated. The post-surgical changes of left ribs
are expected. There is interval decrease in subcutaneous air
collection. Small amount of right pleural effusion is unchanged.

[**2166-2-22**]: One of the two left chest tubes has been removed and
there is no PTX seen.  The residual more medially placed left
chest tube has been pulled back somewhat, with its tip just
above the level of the aortic knob. Subcutaneous emphysema is
identified. Right pleural effusion is seen as was noted
previously. There are some increased interstitial markings but
no new consolidation
[**2166-2-21**]: There is no appreciable left pleural air or fluid. Two
apical pleural tubes unchanged. Mild atelectasis at the base of
the right lung has recurred.
[**2166-2-20**]:Interval worsening in the left apical pneumothorax
without signs
of tension.


Brief Hospital Course:
68 year old male diagnosed Stage III NSCLC in [**9-/2165**] that was
deemed un-resectable prior to chemoRT, s/p chemotherapy x5 and
radiation treatment x16.  He was brought to the OR on [**2-19**] for
thoracotomy, left upper lobectomy, pulmonary artery patch
angioplasty, intercostal muscle flap buttress and mediastinal
lymph node dissection.  During the procedure the left vagus
nerve appeared involved in the tumor and was sacrificed.  ENT
was consulted and found the left TVC to be immobile in the
paramedian position.  The right true vocal fold is WNL and
mobile.  Pt is s/p Gelfoam injection [**2166-2-20**] with good midline
approximation.  Since that time, he has worked with voice
therapy as well as the speech and swallow team and was approved
for a regular diet and has done quite well with respect to PO
intake and strengthening of his voice. His CT was removed on [**2-25**]
and post pull CXR demonstrated no PTX and good lung volumes.
Mr. [**Known lastname 80994**] has worked hard to rehab himself on the floor,
taking several walked each day.  From POD [**2-24**] his O2 requirement
has decreased from 4L to RA at rest and with 83% with activity,
therefore he was discharged to home with oxygen 1-2L for
ambulation, titrate to off as tolerates.   He continued to make
steady progress and was discharged to home with a visiting
nurse.  He will follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 1837**] and his PCP for further coumarin management.
