Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 9554**]
Chief Complaint:
dyspnea, peripheral edema

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
1. Right heart catheterization


History of Present Illness:
54 yo man currently undergoing evaluation for heart transplant
for severe cardiomyopathy previously treated with weekly
nesiritide infusions in [**Hospital 1902**] clinic admitted [**3-8**] with
progressive dyspnea, LE edema, and weight gain (home scale up to
315 lbs from 298) over the past two weeks.  Three weeks prior to
admission, pt was admitted to OSH for diuresis with furosemide.
Patient states his LE edema improved but was not diminished to
the same degree as it was following his hospitalization here in
[**1-28**].  Since his discharge from the OSH two weeks ago, he has
had progressive exertional dyspnea and LE edema despite
compliance with his sodium and volume restriction.  He phoned
the [**Hospital 1902**] clinic [**3-8**] and was referred for hospitalization for
tailored diuresis.

Also of note, on [**3-8**] he noted maxillary > frontal sinus pain
with nasal discharge (initially brown, now chartreuse per
patient) and cough productive of similarly colored sputum.  No
f/c/s.  Symptoms are persistent but improving.  He has been
taking naproxen and OTC decongestants for relief.

He denies increasing orthopnea, chest pain, palpitations,
abdominal pain, n/v, diaphoresis, or dysuria.

Brief Hospital Course:
54 yo man with severe dilated cardiomyopathy admitted for
tailored diuresis, now nearly at his baseline clinical status.

1. Congestive Heart Failure: Patient with known, severe,
non-ischemic, dilated cardiomyopathy as per HPI.  Precipitant
for deterioration in cardiac function on admission unclear,
although patient may simply have severe CHF refractory to
outpatient control.  No symptoms to suggest cardiac ischemia.
Recent NSAID and probable viral sinusitis may have been
contributing factors.  Since admission, right heart cath
demonstrated elevated right and left sided filling pressures and
a depressed cardiac index.  Attempted tailored diuresis with
milrinone resulted in an increased cardiac index and decreased
PCWP but was complicated by acute renal failure due either to
peripheral vasodilatation and poor renal perfusion or
obstructive nephropathy (the patient's Foley catheter may have
been obstructed).  Since the milrinone was stopped on [**5-10**], his
renal function has returned to baseline, and he has diuresed
well.  His net fluid balance this admission is roughly three
liters negative.  His PA catheter has been removed and he is
stable for transfer to the floor.
  - Furosemide 80 mg twice daily, carvedilol 25 mg twice daily,
ASA 81 mg daily
  - Spironolactone 25 mg once daily, lisinopril 20 mg once
daily, metolazone qFri
  - Daily weights
  - Continue fluid and sodium restriction
  - No further NSAIDs
  - Transplant evaluation unremarkable to date

2. Sinusitis: Most likely viral given course of symptoms
(gradually improving), although exquisiste maxillary sinus
tenderness suggests possible bacterial superinfection,
especially given colored nasal discharge.  Symptoms persist but
are improving.
  - Doxycycline 100 mg twice daily for three more days
  - Continue saline and steroid nasal sprays (pt instructed re:
proper usage)
  - Consider sinus CT if symptoms do not continue to improve

3. Acute Renal Failure: Creatinine now back at baseline.
  - Lisinopril dose increased today
  - Recheck BUN and creatinine in the morning

4. Diabetes: Adequacy of outpatient control not clear.
  - Continue twice daily NPH, add RISS while in-house
  - Restart outpatient glyburide
  - Continue gabapentin for neuropathic pain

5. Hypothyroidism: Continue levothyroxine 250 mcg daily

6. Gout: Patient reports gouty attacks have been precipitated by
high-dose furosemide in the past.  He reports that plans to
transition from colchicine to allopurinol have been thwarted by
recurrent hospitalizations.  He has, however, been stable off
colchicine thus far.
  - Continue to hold colchicine
  - Plan outpatient transition to allopurinol

7. Proph: Low-sodium diet, OOB

8. F/E/N: Fluid and sodium restriction as above.  Recheck AM
lytes.

9. Access: Peripheral IVs.

10. Code: Full.

11. Dispo: Possible discharge tomorrow.
