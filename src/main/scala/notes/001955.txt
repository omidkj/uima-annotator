HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 55-year-old
female from [**Hospital3 11148**] [**Hospital3 **] who presents with
shortness of breath.  She has extended medical history and
she has been in the rehabilitation facility for failure to
thrive.  Subsequently, she was discharged to [**Hospital3 **]
facility.  While at assisted-living facility she had an
episode of shortness of breath and breathing difficulties.
She was brought to the emergency [**Hospital1 **] for evaluation.  While
in the emergency department she had an oxygen saturations of
80% on room air and then 97% on 100% nonrebreather.  Of note:
On the ambulance call-in sheet, the patient was also "not
herself," as reported by the assisted-living facility.  There
was a question of mental status change.  ABG showed pH of
7.28, pCO2 of 59, and pO2 80.  She was intubated for
respiratory depression.

MAP 68, respiratory rate 14, FIO2 100%.  Ventilation at tidal
volume of 500 and respiratory rate of 14.  FIO2 of 100%.
GENERAL:  She is a thin, elderly-appearing woman, curved in

atraumatic, pupils equal and reactive to light.  Light
lateral deviation of the right eye, does not follow finger,
intubated.  NECK:  No jugulovenous distention.  CHEST:  Bowel

regular rate and rhythm.  ABDOMEN  Soft, positive bowel
sounds, nondistended, nontender.  Suprapubic catheter site
clean.  EXTREMITIES:  No edema, 1+ peripheral pulses.
NEUROLOGICAL:  Blinks to command, minimally responsive,
spontaneously.  Bilateral fine hand tremor.

LABORATORY DATA:  Laboratory data revealed the following:
White blood count 17.3, hematocrit 37.2, platelet count
249,000, 85% polys, 13% lymphs, 2% monocytes.  PT 15.4, INR
1.6, PTT 29.9.  The Chem 7 revealed sodium 144, potassium
4.1, chloride 105, bicarbonate 23, BUN 9, creatinine 0.6,
glucose 119, calcium 9.3, magnesium 1.6, phosphorus 5.1.  The
serum toxicology was negative.  Urinalysis showed positive
nitrites, moderate leukocyte esterase, many bacteria, 6 to 10
white blood cells, 11 to 20 red blood cells.  The gas, when
intubated was 7.3 pH, pCO2 52, with a pO2 of 448.  The blood
cultures times two and urine cultures, taken at that time,
revealed the following:  Chest x-ray in the ED:  The
endotracheal tube 6.5 cm above the carina, no pneumonia,
increased right hemidiaphragm and emphysema and the head CT
was negative.  The EKG showed normal sinus tachycardia 104
with axis of about 90% with the baseline, no ST and T-wave
changes.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  In the ED, on [**6-27**], the patient's
blood pressure continued to trend downward despite IV fluid
hydration and boluses.  Systolic blood pressure was 65/38.
Discussion with the family revealed that the patient did not
want resuscitation and the sister [**Name (NI) **] did not want any
invasive procedures performed including central lines and the
IJ subclavian and femoral.  She also did not chest
compression or electrical shock should there be a cardiac
event.  After extensive discussion again with the family, it
was decided to make her do not resuscitate and focus on
comfort.

On [**2175-6-27**], secondary to the hypotension, Hydrocort was
started and no central access or pressors were begun due to
the family wishes.  The labs at that time showed a white
blood cell count of 18.1, hematocrit 29.5.  The patient was
febrile with an increased white blood count and started on
Ampicillin and Levofloxacin for positive urinalysis until
sensitivities came back.  On [**6-28**] the urine showed
Gram-negative rods.  Blood culture showed no growth.  The
patient was extubated on [**6-28**].  On that same day she
was afebrile.  White cell count was still elevated to 17.5.
Urine culture on [**2175-6-26**] showed a Gram-negative rods of two
morphologies with greater than 100,000 organisms, however, it
showed contamination with mixed skin and genital flora and
the clinical significance was uncertain.

Blood culture from [**2175-6-26**] was negative.  Blood culture
times two from [**2175-6-26**] was negative.  On [**2175-6-27**] the
sputum grew out moderate growth of Staphylococcus aureus
coagulase positive, Methicillin-sensitive and rate growth of
Aspergillus fumigatus.

The patient was originally started on Vancomycin for the
Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia until sensitivities came
back.  She was also continued on Levaquin.  It was felt that
the urosepsis lead to hypotension and that the Staphylococcus
was secondary to intubation.  The patient was transferred to
the floor to the [**Company 191**] team.

The patient was seen by the Psychiatric Department on
[**2175-6-29**], who made some suggestions about her management.
On [**2175-6-29**], the Staphylococcus aureus was sensitive to
Oxacillin so the Vancomycin was discontinued and she was
started on Oxicillin one gram q.8h.

She had a swallowing study on the 14th because of the concern
about a swallowing risk.  She was continued on Depakote,
Effexor, and Klonopin.  She did not require Haldol as she was
not agitated.

Although the patient had aspergillus in her sputum she did
not immunocompromise, no neutropenia, no known cavity disease
in the lung.  However, chest CT was ordered to further
assess.  CT of the abdomen done on [**2175-7-2**] showed 1 cm left
apical nodule and nonspecific left apical and right middle
lobe scarring.  There was no evidence of ABPA or an
aspergilloma.  The absence of neutropenia, these findings are
unlikely to represent invasive aspergillosis. Recommend
follow up in two to three months as a neoplastic process
cannot be excluded.  Bilateral pleural effusions and
atelectasis.  Mild emphysema.

Infectious Disease was consulted and felt that the positive
aspergillus in the sputum is likely colonizer in the setting
of pre-existing lung disease and emphysema, so there is no
need to start treatment yet for Aspergillosis now.
Infectious Disease also recommended a total of 10 to 14 day
course of Levaquin.  On a note by Infectious Disease date
[**7-5**], they state that due to the patient and the
family's wishes, the patient is not to have any further
diagnostic procedures and will not pursue investigation of
left apical nodule any further.

The Department of Neurology was contact[**Name (NI) **] on [**7-5**],
regarding placement of the suprapubic catheter.  However,
they eventually declined to see the patient as she is to get
services at [**Hospital3 **] and they stress that she
return there to continue with the Foley for now.  The
patient's neurologist at the [**Hospital3 **],
Dr.  [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 98503**], [**Telephone/Fax (1) 98506**] called regarding the
patient's movement disorder and torticollis.  Neurology
suggested Benadryl 25 t.i.d. for torticollis.  The patient
reported failing Botox injections.
