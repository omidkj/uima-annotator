ELECTROCARDIOGRAM PERFORMED ON: [**2158-7-24**]
Sinus tachycardia with complete heart block and independent
question
fascicular/ventricular escape rhythm. Diffuse ST-T wave
abnormalities - cannot
exlucde ischemia and/or metabolic/drug effect. Clinical
correlation is
suggested. Since the previous tracing earlier this date second
degree block
appears to have progressed to complete heart block and with
evident change in
QRS morphology.

ECHO CARDIOGRAM PERFORMED ON: [**2158-7-26**]
Left Ventricle - Ejection Fraction: 35% to 40%
Overall left ventricular systolic function is moderately
depressed. Resting regional wall motion abnormalities include
inferior and iseptal hypokinesis. Right ventricular chamber size
appears mildly dilated with borderline free wall hypokinesis.
The aortic root is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is a minimally increased gradient
consistent with minimal aortic valve stenosis. Trace aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Mild to moderate ([**12-16**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
On arrival at [**Hospital1 18**], pt able to give some hx & satting high 90s
on NRB. SBP initially 220s so started on nitro drip. Rhythm
initially 2:1 AV block. ECG w/prominent R in V2, + <0.[**Street Address(2) 1755**]
depress. In [**Name (NI) **], pt became diaphoretic, sats fell to the low 90s
on NRB, became agitated & was emergently intubated. Antibiotics
were started empirically for possible pneumonia in the setting
of pulmonary edema.
Rhythm became CHB transiently & SBP then dipped to ~80mmHg.
Unable to transcutaneously pace & started on dopamine. Rhythm
spontaneously went back to 2:1 AV block. Pt went emergently to
the cath lab coronary/hemodynamics eval. Discovered to have an
ejection fraction of around 20% and a cardiac index of 1.9. A
temporary pacing wire was placed.

The pt did well with the temporary pacer and was subsequently
extubated. EP conducted a conduction study of the heart and
replaced the temporary wire with a permanent DDD pacemaker. The
pt has done well with the pacemaker, and a cardiac medication
regiment has been established.

The patient has experienced episodes of dysuria, for which
urology was consulted given the patient's history of prostate CA
for which he is presently not receiving treatment. The pt
received some symptomatic relief with pyridium. Outpatient
urological follow-up of the prostate CA is strongly recommended.
