History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 47 yo female with h/o HTN, osteoporosis, sleep
apnea and severe COPD with FEV1 of 13 % who orginally presented
on [**12-13**] with 2-3 weeks of increasing dyspnea that has limited
her ability to the point she had difficulty ambulating even a
few steps and had increased her home 02 from 2-4L in this [**3-19**]
week period. The day prior to admission she had some rhinorrhea
and cold sx. She was admitted to the ICU due to increased work
of breathing. She was briefly on CPAP, but was quickly weaned to
NC and was stable. Previous symptoms suggestive of URI and
possible COPD exacerbation. Ruled out for flu by nasal aspirate.
Given stressed dosed steroids and started on Levofloxacin to
complete a 7 day course. Pt ruled out for PE with CTA and MI by
cardiac enzymes. For remainder of her ICU stay she was on 5 L of
NC as per her new baseline. in addition, she has chronic
tachycardia and was started on diltiazem.
.
On transfer from the ICU, she reports that her breathing seems
to be at baseline. She was able to get up and walk about 50 feet
with PT. Denies CP, worsened SOB, palpitations, headache, N/V.
She has her chronic back pain. She does report some abdmiinal
fullness and crampimg which has improved today after a BM with
bowel regimen
.
ROS: Positive as above and also for occasional feeling of
lightheadedness on standing, occasional sharp substernal chest
pain (isolated episodes, 2-3 times in the last several weeks)
now resolved. Otherwise she has no symptoms of vomiting,
headache, dysuria, abdominal pain, cough, change in sputum
(always yellow), passing out.
.
In the ED: patient's intial vitals were HR 140, BP 110/80, RR
30, 02 sat 100% RA. She received Xoponex, Combivent neb x 1,
Ativan, Methylprednisolone, 1 L NS, magnesium. Additionally
blood cultures were sent. Patient had increasing work to breathe
and then required CPAP.
.
On admission to the ICU, the patient required CPAP, but was able
to answer questions appropriately and did not have any acute
symptoms of pain or dyspnea. She was quickly weaned to nasal
canula and felt that her breathing had improved.

CTA CHEST W&W/O C &RECONS  [**2151-12-13**] 11:55 PM

INDICATION: 37-year-old woman with COPD and increasing dyspnea
on exertion in the setting of chest pain. Evaluate for pulmonary
embolism.

CTA OF THE CHEST: No filling defects or pulmonary emboli are
identified within the pulmonary arteries to the level of the
segmental branches. Scattered aortic calcifications are seen,
however the aorta is within normal caliber and contour
throughout its course.

CT OF THE CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST: Soft tissue window images
demonstrate no pathologically-enlarged mediastinal, hilar, or
axillary lymphadenopathy. The heart and pericardium are normal
in appearance. No pleural or pericardial effusions are seen.
Lung window images demonstrate no pulmonary nodules or
parenchymal consolidation. Scattered emphysematous changes are
seen diffusely throughout the lungs.

Limited images of the superior portion of the abdomen
demonstrate a cyst with calcification within the superior pole
of the left kidney. The visualized parts of the liver, spleen,
right kidney, adrenal glands, and pancreas are within normal
limits.

BONE WINDOWS: Compression deformities are seen within several
mid thoracic vertebral bodies, of indeterminate age.

CT RECONSTRUCTIONS: Multiplanar reconstructions were essential
in delineating the anatomy and pathology.

IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
2. Extensive emphysematous changes are seen bilaterally.
3. Hypodensity within the superior pole of the left kidney with
wall calcification likely represents a complex cyst.
4. Multiple compression farctures of the thoracic vertebrae.
.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2151-12-13**] 12:46 PM

INDICATION: Shortness of breath.

FINDINGS: Allowing for apical lordotic projection,
cardiomediastinal contours are within normal limits. There are
no focal areas of consolidation within the lungs, and no pleural
effusions are identified on this single projection. Attenuation
of the upper lobe vasculature is suggestive of underlying
emphysema.

IMPRESSION: Emphysema. No pneumonia.


Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 47 yo with COPD admitted with increasing respiratory
disress now stable at baseline and transferred to floor.
.
# Respiratory distress- As the patient has severe disease and
has a history of intubation and severe decompensation, the
patient was felt to require MICU care but rapidly improved. The
cause for her decompensation is likely a viral infection given
her recent fatigue and shortness of breath coupled with her
occasional rhinorrhea. Already r/o flu and r/o MI. (Of note,
bronchial washing in OMR were logged incorrectly and are not
from this patient) Will continue to treat for COPD

next 3 days
- completed 7 days Levofloxacin for COPD exacerbation
- Ipratroprium, atrovent q6h prn
- continue home pulm meds: montelukast, advair 500-50,
tiotropium 18mcg daily
- viral cultures negative
- RISS while on steroids
.
# Tachycardia: Patient with chronic history of sinus
tachycardia. Cause unclear. Fluid resuscitated. TFTs checked.
- Continue dilt
.
# Osteoporosis: Patient with history of persistent fractures as
a result of persistent steroid administration.
- Continue Forteo as per outpatient regimen
- Con't Vitamin D and calcium
