History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 58834**] is a 42-year-old gentleman with a history of anxiety
who was in his usual state of health until roughly three weeks
ago.  At that time he started to feel increasingly fatigued.  He
noted that he was short of breath, even with minimal exertion,
which was unusual for him.  He also started to develop chills
and drenching night sweats.  About two weeks ago he started to
notice a pain in his left side. Last week he saw his PCP who
thought he had a URI and a muscle strain and he was started on
Avelox and Percocet.  Since then he has had intermittent nausea
and vomiting.  This was thought be secondary to the Avelox so
his antibiotics were switched two days ago (he cannot recall to
what).  He has continued to have nausea with minimal vomiting.
His appetite and po intake have been poor.  For the last week he
has had fevers nightly to 100.2 and the drenching night sweats
have continued.  He returned to his PCP on day of admission who
sent a CBC which was significant for anemia and
thrombocytopenia, as well as a WBC of 16 with an abnormal
differential. He was sent in the ED for further evaluation.  Per
patient's report, he has had "normal blood work" in the past and
has never been anemic.
.
Prior to the last few weeks, he was feeling well. He has not had
any other illnesses recently. He denies any headaches or visual
changes. He has shortness of breath when climbing up the stairs
or performing basic ADLs. He notes intermittent chest tightness
that "comes and goes" which is more chronic for him. He had an
episode of diarrhea yesterday.  No blood in his stool. No
urinary symptoms. No gingival bleeding or epistaxis. He has not
noted any rash. No lower extremity edema.

Past Medical History:
Anxiety and seasonal allergies

ECHO [**9-9**]:
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion
abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF 60-70%). Tissue Doppler
imaging suggests a normal left ventricular filling pressure
(PCWP<12mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The aortic root is moderately dilated at the
sinus level. The ascending aorta is moderately dilated. The
aortic arch is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no
aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve appears structurally
normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is no mitral
valve prolapse. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not
be determined. There is no pericardial effusion.

CT TORSO [**9-10**]
IMPRESSION:
1. Enlarged and fatty liver.
2. Massive spleen. Nonspecific hyperdensity in the posterior
aspect of the
spleen.
3. Prominent lymph nodes in the porta hepatis, and portacaval
lymph node,
with a large number of small retroperitoneal lymph nodes.
4. Left kidney is low positioned, but likely from an enlarged
spleen.
5. Small left fat-containing hernia.
6. Transverse colon compressed below the tip of the spleen, of
uncertain
clinical significance, correlate with clinical symptoms (if
any).

MRI HEAD [**10-3**]:
IMPRESSION: Focal acute infarction which appears to be
cortically-based, in a
non-arterial vascular distribution involving the left frontal
and parietal
lobes. Susceptibility artifact in the overlying veins and
superior sagittal sinus is concerning for venous thrombosis. The
findings likely represent acute venous infarction. A tiny focus
of T1 hyperintensity in the left temporal lobe may represent a
small focus of hemorrhage, which progresses rapidly to become
much larger on the subsequent head CTs.
A wet [**Location (un) 1131**] was given by the resident to Brit Guims at 5:10
p.m. on [**2117-10-3**] stating "Cortically based infarct DWI/ADC
abnormality in the left parietal area involving pre- and mainly
post-central gyrus area consistent with acute infarct. GRE
blooming in the left M4 cortical branches may indicate clot and
seen to vertex."

An additional [**Location (un) 1131**] describing the venous nature of the acute
infarct and acute thrombosis of cortical veins and the superior
sagittal sinus was given to Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 3461**] [**Name (STitle) 12332**] (Neurology
service) at 11:00 a.m. on [**2117-10-4**], and the findings were fully
discussed with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], shortly
thereafter.

CT HEAD [**2117-10-4**]:
Large hemorrhagic transformation of left MCA territory infarct
with severe increased edema and rightward shift of midline
structures to 7 mm, up to 4 mm. New hyperdense focus medial to
existing hemorrhage measuring 4 x 5 mm. Possible left uncal
herniation also.

CT HEAD [**2117-10-6**]:  Stable extent of large hemorrhage in the left
frontoparietal lobes with stable rightward shift of midline
structures. No new areas of hemorrhage seen.

CT head [**2117-10-16**]:
1. Evolution of left frontoparietal hemorrhage with increased
rightward shift from 6 to 12 mm.
2. No new hemorrhage.
3. Basal cisterns are preserved.
4. Enlargement of temporal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of right lateral ventricle is
suggestive of subfalcine herniation.

CT abdomen and pelvis with contrast [**2117-10-27**]:
1. Splenomegaly with a moderate-to-large wedge-shaped area of
hypoperfusion
and a smaller ovoid area posteriorly of hypoperfusion, both of
which most
likely represent splenic infarct.

2. Minimally prominent bowel wall involvin
