CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2177-11-2**] 5:19 PM

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST

Reason: Please assess for bleed/fracture

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
73 year old man with motorcycle crash - trauma
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
Please assess for bleed/fracture
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.

INDICATION: Trauma.

TECHNIQUE: Head CT without contrast.

FINDINGS: A mild-to-moderate amount of subarachnoid hemorrhage
is visualized in the left temporo-parietal area. Additionally
there is a moderate amount of hemorrhage in the lateral
ventricles. Areas of low attenuation are visualized in the grey
and white matter of the right frontal and parietal lobes. There
are multiple small areas of density seen in the right
frontoparietal lobe region as well of unknown etiology. Most, if
not all, of these are probably subarachnoid in location. There
is evbidence of prior surgery with fixation in the cervical
spine on the scout view.

IMPRESSION:
1. Mild-to-moderate amount of subarachnoid hemorrhage in the
anterior cranial fossa.
2. Moderate amount of hemorrhage in the lateral ventricles.
3. Encephalomalacia right hemisphere, probably remote. Clinical
correlation suggested.
4. Densities in right anterior cranial fossa, possibly
Pantopaque or calcifications.

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2177-11-16**] 9:13 AM

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST

Reason: interval change

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
73 year old man with mental status changes
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
interval change
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.

HISTORY: Mental status change.

COMPARISON: Head CT from [**2177-11-11**].

TECHNIQUE: Non-contrast head CT.

HEAD CT WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: There has been minimal decrease in
the amount of intraventricular blood demonstrated within the
occipital horns bilaterally, as well as within the sulci of the
left frontoparietal region. Again demonstrated is a low-density
right frontal subdural collection, which is stable in appearance
since the prior examination. Stable areas of low attenuation are
demonstrated within the right frontal, temporal, and parietal
regions with associated encephalomalacia, unchanged since the
prior exam. Tiny punctate calcifications are also again seen
within the right hemisphere.

There are no new areas of intercranial hemorrhage or mass effect
demonstrated. There is no shift in midline structures. The
ventricles are stable in size.

There is interval improvement in the degree of mucosal
thickening seen within the sphenoid and ethmoid sinuses. There
is continued opacification of both mastoid air cells.
Surrounding osseous and soft tissue structures are unchanged.

IMPRESSION: Minimal decrease in amount of intraventricular and
subarachnoid blood. Stable appearance of the ventricles. Stable
right frontal low-density subdural collection. No new areas of
hemorrhage or mass effect identified.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2177-11-16**] 8:27 AM

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)

Reason: fevers, secretions

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
73 year old man with trauma.
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
fevers, secretions
CHEST, SINGLE AP FILM

History of trauma with fever and increased secretions.

The tracheostomy tube is 5 cm above the carina. Left subclavian
CV line is in distal SVC. No pneumothorax. There are multiple
left-sided rib fractures with a small left pleural effusion and
atelectasis at the left lung base. Status post fusion lower
cervical spine. A focal opacity in the right lower zone is
likely composite rib and vascular density.


Brief Hospital Course:
Patient admitted to the trauma service. Neurosurgery and
Orthopedics immediately consulted. Patient loaded with Dilantin,
ICP bolt placed because of low GCS 4. He underwent serial head
CT scans which were stable. His pubic symphysis diastasis was
evaluated by Orthopedics; no surgical intervention. He underwent
tracheostomy and percutaneous PEG placement on [**2177-11-13**]; his
TF's are currently being cycled (see page 1 diet section).
Respiratory therapy has been following for his copious
secretions; does require frequent suctioning and he is on trach
mask. He does have a history of sleep apnea and uses CPAP at
home. Physical and occupational therapy were consulted and have
recommended acute rehab stay post hospitalization.
