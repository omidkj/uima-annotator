Service: SURGERY

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2836**]
Chief Complaint:
Respiratory distress

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Thoracentesis

History of Present Illness:
82 year-old woman with hypothyroidism, obesity, recent admission
last month for pneumonia (treated with Vanco and Zosyn),
admitted with SOB and hypoxia to 88%.  She reports increased new
lower extremity edema over the past few days.  She denies cough,
lightheadeness, nausea, vomiting, fevers, chills, or abdominal
pain.

Of note, patient was discharged from the [**Hospital1 882**] on [**1-30**] for
pneumonia.  At this time, her BUN was 11 and Cr 1.1.  She
completed a course of Vanco and Zosyn on [**2-2**].  While at
rehab, she was continued on Lasix 40 mg daily and her Creatinine
was noted to steadily rise.  On [**2-5**], she was found to be
coughing so was started on Avelox (completed [**2-13**]) for
empiric PNA treatment.  On [**2-8**], Her BUN was 34 and Cr 2.5
and so her lasix was lowered to 20 mg daily.  Her lasix was
ultimately stopped on [**2-13**] when she was found to have a BUN
of 43 and Cr of 3.2.  Her WBC was found to be rising on [**2-16**]. At that time, she was noted to have a rash on her back and
worsening LE edema.

Upon arrival to the ED, her vitals were T 98.1, HR 97, RR 22,
98% on 3LNC (88% on RA), BP 111/79.  In the ED, she was
hypotensive to the 80s transiently, but responded to IVF
boluses.  Her CXR was difficult to interpret but showed LLL
opacity with effusion and she was treated for PNA with Vanco and
Cefepime.   Given her elevated LFTs, A RUQ was performed which
demonstrated gallstones but could not rule out cholectysitis.
She was seen by surgery who felt her presentation was not
consistent with cholectysitis (no abdominal pain, fevers) and
therefor did not recommend surgical intervention.

Past Medical History:
- Hypothyroidism
- Obesity
- Iron deficiency anemia
- Thoracic aorta aneurysms
- H/o gallstones
- H/o pancreatic pseudocysts and radiographic evidence of
pancreatitis without clinical symptoms (noted [**2125-1-26**])
- Recent LLL CAP with planned Vanco/Zosyn course to end [**2125-2-2**]
- H/o renal failure in [**Month (only) **] due to "accidentally taking too much
lasix"

Social History:
Patient currently residing at rehab facility after
hospitalization for PNA.  She is married.  She denies alcohol or
tobacco use.

Family History:
History of pancreatic cancer in family

[**2125-2-20**]: UPEP abnormal

[**2125-2-21**]: PLEURAL FLUID CYTOLOGY: No malignant cells

[**2125-2-23**]: BONE MARROW BIOPSY: PENDING

IMAGING:
CXR [**2125-2-19**]:
1. Large left lung base opacification, combination of
consolidation and large
left effusion.
2. Likely small right effusion.
3. Central venous congestion.

ABDOMINAL ULTRASOUND [**2125-2-19**]:
IMPRESSION: The constellation of cholelithiasis, peri-pancreatic
fluid, and
lab evidence of pancreatitis is consistent with gallstone
pancreatitis.

CT ABDOMEN AND PELVIS [**2125-2-20**]:
1. Diffuse enlargement of the pancreas with areas of hypodensity
that could
represent pseudocysts, although these are not well delineated
given lack of IV contrast. Note that a pancreatic mass cannot be
excluded. There are several focal fluid collections, likely
representing pseudocysts, including within the gastrohepatic
ligament, left upper quadrant, and likely splenic subcapsular.
There is small abdominal and moderate pelvic ascites. There is
apparent thickening of the distal stomach/proximal duodenum,
with apparent mass effect from the pancreatic head enlargement.
2. Cholelithiasis.
3. Cecal and proximal ascending colonic thickening, which may be
infectious
or inflammatory, but ischemia cannot be excluded.
4. Large left pleural effusion and left lower lobe collapse.
Small right
pleural effusion and compressive atelectasis.

ECHO [**2125-2-21**]: No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color
Doppler. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and
global systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%). Due to
suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality
cannot be fully excluded. There is no ventricular septal defect.
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is
not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is
seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The
pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
There is no pericardial effusion.

BILATERAL LOWER EXTREMITY DOPPLERS [**2125-2-22**]:
1. Left distal popliteal vein DVT. Left posterior tibial vein
showed
decreased flow consistent with thrombus.
2. Right and left calf veins not clearly evaluated.


Brief Hospital Course:
82 year-old woman presents with gallstone pancreatitis with
peripancreatic fluid with concomitant pleural effusion which is
likely an extension of abdominal cavity fluid. Other active
issues that the patient presented with are acute renal failure,
LLE DVT, and abnormal UPEP.

hospital course: The patient arrived in respiratory distress and
hypoxic [**12-26**] CHF and pleural effusion.  A thoracentesis was
performed on [**2125-2-21**] and one liter of transudative fluid was
aspirated.  She was placed on Vanco, Cefepime, and Flagyl to
cover both pneumonia and cholangitis.  ERCP consult was obtained
and deferred EUS or ERCP until clinical status improved.
Pancreatitis was treated conservatively.  CT scan performed and
noted that her CBD was dilated, question if this is
post-obstructive changes. Patient also had truncal rash that was
non pruritic, drug rash-like, but there is not a clear offending
medication.  This was followed conservatively. Acute renal
failure did not resolve after hydration, renal was consulted and
followed noted that this is ATN with uric acid crystals.  SPEP
noted to have possible polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia.  UPEP
showed heavy chain bands, so heme-onc was consulted.  LLE DVT
found and heparin gtt started.  Post-pyloric feeding tube was
placed because of pancreatitis.  The patient was stable for
transfer to the floor.  After being transferred to the floor,
she became tachypneic, tachycardic with mild hypotension and
thus was transferred to the trauma ICU.  This was thought to be
due to PE for which she was treated with a heparin gtt.  She was
intubated on [**3-7**] and cardioverted for rapid afib and started on
pressors.  She remained in the TSICU for the remainder of her
stay.  She was intubated and sedated.  She required pressors for
hypotension and amiodarone for paroxysmal afib.  She continued
to have a significant vent requirement with high peep due to
pulmonary edema. She receieved a trach on [**3-15**].  She had a
dobhoff tube placed and was fed enterally.  She h
