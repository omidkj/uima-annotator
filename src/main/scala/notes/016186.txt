History of Present Illness:
Mrs. [**Known lastname **] is a 75 year old female with history of mitral valve

regurgitation. LV gram showed an LVEF of 40%. Based upon the
above, she was transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] for cardiac surgical
intervention.

Coronary Artery Disease - prior PCI/stenting to LAD and Diag
History of remote MI

Denies history of tobacco and ETOH. She is a retired textile
worker. She currently lives with her daughter.

Strong family history of premature coronary artery disease. Two
brothers died of MI at ages 51 and 57. Father died of MI at age
55. Mother died at age 77 of a stroke.

   RADIOLOGY  Final Report

CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2129-7-18**] 9:52 AM

CHEST (PA & LAT)

Reason: evaluate effusion

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
75 year old woman with MR
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
evaluate effusion

TWO VIEWS OF THE CHEST ON [**7-18**]

Two views of the chest were obtained and compared with the
previous study on [**7-14**]. The main pulmonary artery line has been
removed but a right jugular catheter remains in place. The tip
appears to be in the right atrium. The left pectoral battery
apparatus and the right ventricular lead noted. The right lung
is clear. There is a small right basal effusion. The left heart
border and diaphragm are obscured by a larger left pleural
effusion and possibly some left lower lobe atelectasis or
infiltrate. Artificial mitral valve has been placed.

CONCLUSION: Main change is the removal of the pulmonary artery
line. The lungs are clear with the exception of the bilateral
effusions and what could be some left lower lobe atelectasis or
infiltrate.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify
I was present in compliance with HCFA regulations. No TEE
related
complications. The TEE probe was passed with assistance from the

anesthesioology staff using a laryngoscope. The patient was

Conclusions:
Pre-CPB:
1. No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the left atrial
appendage.
2. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
3. There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The
left
ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function
is severely depressed (LVEF=25 - 30 %).
4. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal.
5. There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
6. There are three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve
leaflets are
moderately thickened. There is mod
