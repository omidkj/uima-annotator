Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1042**]
Chief Complaint:
Fatigue, lightheadedness, CP, SOB and fever

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
 61 female with a h/o right Wilms tumor, s/p nephrectomy on the
R in [**2078**] and nephrectomy on the L on [**1-4**]/008 for a lower pole
renal mass with pending pathology who now presents with SOB, CP
and fever. The patient reports that she was suffering from
constipation and took a dulcolax which resulted in a large BM
this morning around 2am. She started to feel fatigued and
lightheaded afterwards. THen she developed a fever to 102 and
chest pain that was sharp and located over her R sternum and L
shoulder. It was pleuritic and non radiating. She also started
to develop mild SOB and was brought to the ED. Reportedly at
home her BP was high over the last days after she was discharged
from the hospital, ranging between 150 and 180 systolic.
.
Of note, she underwent L nephrectomy on [**1-4**] and has been doing
fine since. The operation and postoperative phase went without
complications. She has been doing well at home afterwards and is
able to ambulate a flight of stairs without complications. He
was dialyzed yesterday without complications
.
On arrival in the ED she was hypotensive with blood pressure of
106/52 which then decreased further to 76 over palp systolic.
Other Vitals 98.3 100 95%on 2LNC. CT significant for large
pleural effusions b/l and moderate to large pericardial
effusion. More focal opacity again seen in the right lower lobe.
Again findings are suspicious for endobronchial lesion with
post-obstructive pneumonia although infectious pneumonia and
aspiration cannot be excluded. Also large amount of
pneumoperitoneum, possibly post-surgical. The patient also
received Ceftriaxone, Azithromycin and Zosyn. She received one
dose of dexamethasone due to her absolute adrenal insufficiency.
She received Tylenol, Fentanyl 50mcg and Morphine 2mg for pain.

.
On ROS, she denies recent antibiotic use other than one
preoperative dose of antibiotics. Otherwise she denies abdominal
pain, changes in the color of her stool or urine. She denies any
sick contacts.

CTA CHEST W&W/O C&RECONS, NON-CORONARY  [**2101-1-13**] 7:39 PM

CTA CHEST W&W/O C&RECONS, NON-; CT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST

Reason: LT NEPHRECTOMY, NOW RT PLEURITIC CP, FRVER.
Field of view: 38 Contrast: OPTIRAY

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
61 year old woman with recent L nephrectomy, now with R
pleuritic CP, fever, dyspnea.
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
evaluate for PE, evaluate for intraabdominal process.
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.

INDICATION: 61-year-old woman with recent left nephrectomy, now
with right pleuritic chest pain, fever, dyspnea.

COMPARISON: CT of the chest [**2101-1-1**], CT of the abdomen
[**2100-11-30**].

TECHNIQUE: MDCT-acquired axial images of the chest, abdomen and
pelvis were obtained with IV contrast. Images of the chest were
also obtained without IV contrast. Multiplanar reformatted
images were also displayed.

CT OF THE CHEST WITH AND WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: There is a new
moderate-to- large pericardial effusion. The pericardial
effusion measures of simple fluid attenuation, no definite
enhancing wall is identified.

Multiple prominent mediastinal lymph nodes are again seen,
slightly larger compared to prior chest CT. Enlarged right hilar
lymph node (3A:37) measures 17 mm in short-axis dimension,
little changed from prior.

New large bilateral pleural effusions with associated
atelectasis are identified. A more focal consolidation is again
seen within the right lower lobe. Previously described multiple
pulmonary nodules are not well evaluated on the current study.

There is no evidence of pulmonary embolism.

CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST: There is a large amount of
pneumoperitoneum, possibly post-surgical in nature. Free fluid
seen scattered throughout the abdomen and pelvis, also
presumably post-surgical. The liver, pancreas, spleen appear
unremarkable. Patient is status post bilateral nephrectomies. No
definite recurrent mass is identified within the nephrectomy
beds.

Visualized portions of bowel appear unremarkable. There is no
evidence of obstruction. Normal appendix is identified.

Surgical staples seen in the anterior left abdominal wall.

CT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST: The rectum, sigmoid, bladder
appear unremarkable. Heterogeneous enhancing uterus consistent
with fibroid uterus is noted. Free fluid seen tracking into the
pelvis.

BONE WINDOWS: No suspicious lytic or blastic lesions are
identified.

IMPRESSION:
1. New moderate-to-large pericardial effusion.
2. New large bilateral pleural effusions with associated
atelectasis.
3. Focal opacity again seen in the right lower lobe. Again
findings are suspicious for endobronchial lesion with
post-obstructive pneumonia although infectious pneumonia and
aspiration cannot be excluded. As previously recommended,
dedicated bronchoscopy could be helpful for further evaluation.
4. No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
5. Large amount of pneumoperitoneum, possibly post-surgical.
6. Free fluid in the abdomen, presumably post-surgical.

The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2101-1-13**] 12:56 PM

CHEST (PA & LAT)

Reason: Evaluate for PNA

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
61 year old woman with fever, R chest pain. Recently postop
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
Evaluate for PNA
INDICATION: Fever, right-sided chest pain.

COMPARISONS: [**2101-1-4**].

CHEST, PA AND LATERAL: A dual lumen left internal jugular
approach hemodialysis catheter tip is within the SVC in
unchanged position. There are new, patchy airspace opacities at
the left lung base with a left-sided pleural effusion. A small
right-sided pleural effusion is also likely. Pulmonary
vasculature is within normal limits. Numerous surgical clips
within the abdomen and surgical staples overlying the left flank
are again identified. Free intraperitoneal air is consistent
with recent postoperative status.

IMPRESSION: Interval development of patchy airspace opacity at
the left lung base concerning for pneumonia giving the history.
Left-sided pleural effusion and likely small right-sided pleural
effusion. No evidence of CHF.
