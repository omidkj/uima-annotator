Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2932**]
Chief Complaint:
leg weakness

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
79 year old male male with h/o inoperable 6 cm AAA, severe AS
(0.9 cm), alcoholic cirrhosis, stable liver lesion x 3 years,
who was in his USOH until 3 months ago, when he developed
progressively worsening upper back and bilateral shoulder pain.
He went to see his PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] he was noted to have a 10 lb
unintentional weight loss over one year, but ROS otherwise
negative. Labs checked at that time were normal, except for an
elevated AFP of 450. An abdominal u/s demonstrated a stable
liver lesion of three years (never biopsied at patient's wishes)
and a new bladder lesion.  He was treated with multiple,
different regimens for his back pain, including Motrin,
Xanaflex, Toradol, and most recently oxycodone without relief.
On day of admission, the patient's granddaughter, who is a RN,
called the patient's PCP reporting that he fell yesterday from a
standing position onto right side, and was now unable to get up
from the couch and unable to urinate. At home, he was also noted
to be hypotensive to 60/palp by his granddaughter. [**Name (NI) **] PCP's
advice, the patient was then taken to the [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]. He had a
lumbar spine MRI which was reportedly normal.  In the OSH ED,
800 cc of urine was drained by a foley. His BNP was elevated to
1600, troponin of 0.3 with no ischemic changes noted on his EKG.
His creatinine was also noted to be elevated to 2.1 from a
baseline of 1.0. The patient was also noted to be hypoxic at
86%/2LNC with an ABG of 7.42/24/50. He was subsequently placed
on 15 L of O2, with a SaO2 of 91%. CXR was consistent with
pneumonia and congestive heart failure. At the OSH, he received
250 mg Levoflox x 1, Lasix 20 mg IV x 2, and lovenox SC for
elevated troponin prior to transfer to [**Hospital1 18**] ICU for further
management.

1. 6 cm AAA - inoperable
2. severe AS (0.9 cm)
3. alcoholic cirrhosis
4. h/o liver lesion x 3 yrs

8. Active EtOH use


Social History:
He lives at home alone in a [**Location (un) 1773**] apt, able to ambulate
at baseline up the stairs and 30-50 yards without dyspnea.
Former 20 ppy history, quit 20 years ago. Still drinks [**2-7**] pint
per day per family (pt denies), last drink likely 2 days PTA.

Brief Hospital Course:
79 y/o male with AAA, EtOH cirrhosis, critical AS, p/w LE
paresis found to have cord compression at T4 due to metastatic
cancer (multiple spinal, liver, bladder) of unknown primary

1. Spinal cord compression: Spine MRIs showed T4 infiltrated
with associated compression fracture and cord compression.
Multiple other lesions noted throughout thoracic vertebra T2-T8.
The patient was started on IV decadron. Given worsening lower
extremity functioning, the patient was transferred to the [**Hospital Ward Name **] medical service for urgent radiation. He had minimal if
any improvement with radiation. Neurosurgery evaluated him for
possible surgery, but felt he was not a good operative candidate
given critical aortic stenosis and 6 cm AAA.

2. Metastatic cancer to spine (unknown primary). Given known
liver lesion and markedly elevated AFP (865), hepatocellular
carcinoma was suspected. Other possibilities include bladder
cancer (given bladder mass), although urine cytology showed only
degenerated epithelial cells. SPEP showed a small monoclonal
band (most polyclonal) and UPEP was negative. PSA was within
normal limits. Initially, a full metastatic work-up (chest CT,
bone scan) was planned with possible IR-guided biopsy (spine vs
liver).  However, given underlying medical problems (critical
AS), poor prognosis (multiple metastases), worsening medical
status (worsening transaminitis, thrombocytopenia, possible DIC,
CHF in setting of severe AS, demand ischemia), the patient was
felt to be unlikely to tolerate both invasive diagnostic testing
and chemotherapy. A family meeting was held, and the decision
was made to pursue comfort-oriented care with a plan to
transition to hospice. The patient's mental status gradually
declined, and he passed away on [**2107-9-16**].
