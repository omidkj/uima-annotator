Allergies:
Penicillins / Lopressor

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3326**]
Chief Complaint:
hematemesis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
EGD s/p sclerotherapy


History of Present Illness:
81y/o M with h/o diverticular bleed presented to ED with melena
and BRBPR x1 day.  Pt felt lightheaded, but denied CP,
palpitations, or dyspnea at rest. + DOE.  Denied N/V.  Pt was
noted to be guaiac positive on ED exam.  Hct had dropped from
41.9 in [**7-14**] to 33.7.  NG lavage was performed, which revealed
active bleeding that did not clear - 1000cc lavage was
performed.  Pt was noted to have ST depressions in V2-V3 and
elevated troponin to 0.15.  Pt was transfused 5 units PRBCs.
EGD revealed esophageal varices and active bleeding.  Banding
was attempted but unsuccessful.  Profuse bleeding was noted
during EGD, and pt had episodes of frank hematemesis.  He was
therefore intubated and sedated.

In the [**Name (NI) **], pt rec'd 6 units PRBC and 5 units FFP (INR 2.9 on
presentation).  He also rec'd protonix 40mg IV x1, sandestatin
200mcg IV x1, levofloxacin 500mg IV x1, propofol gtt,
succinylcholine/etomidate, vitamin K sc, and octreotide gtt.  He
was given a total of 6 units FFP, as well, as well as a bag of
platelets, and taken to IR for emergent TIPS.

At IR, pt was noted to have small systemic-portal pressure
gradient (10mm Hg), with elevated Pra (25mm Hg) and portal
pressures of 35mm Hg.  Varices did not fill with injection of
dye into the portal vein.  TIPS was not performed.

Past Medical History:
1. Atrial fibrillation on Coumadin.
2. Type 2 diabetes, with peripheral neuropathy.
3. Coronary artery disease status post stent [**6-/2115**]: 90% LCx, 80%
OM2; returned with prox LCx occlusion and restenosis of OM2 -
restented; then had in-stent thrombosis/reocclusion of LCx,
treated successfully with PTCA.
[**9-/2118**]: NQMI and repeat catheterzation which revealed a moderate
mid-LAD stenosis, a 30% proximal LCX stenosis, a normal RCA and
an 80% D1 stenosis. He was treated medically.
[**4-/2119**]: Recurrent unstable angina and repeat catheterization
revealed 30% stenosis in the mid LCX and OM 1, 50% stenosis in
the mid LAD, and 60-70% stneoses in the distal LCX and D1. Once
again he was treated medically.
[**1-11**]: NSTEMI, admitted, CK peak 462, trop peak 0.09. In the
setting of acute bronchitis; no intervention performed.
P-MIBI [**2-12**]: There is a moderate, fixed defect involving the
basilar portion of the lateral wall. EF 52%.
Echo [**1-11**]: EF > 55%. LA, RA dil. Mild regional left ventricular
systolic dysfunction. Inferolateral akinesis and basal inferior
akinesis. Right ventricular systolic function is probably
presrved. 1+ MR. Moderate pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension.
4. Hypertension.
5. Diverticulosis, with h/o GI bleed.
7. Status post cataract extraction c/b infection and vision
loss.
8. Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
10. History of retroperitoneal abscess.
11. History of tuberculosis in the past status post thoracotomy.

12. BPH, s/p TURP in [**2122**].
13. Neurogenic bladder with h/o urinary retention.
12. Emphysema, but mixed obstructive and restrictive picture
[**3-16**]: FEV1 67%, FVC 85%, FEV1/FVC 79%. TLC 81%, RV 74%, severely
reduced DLCO.
12. Lung nodule incidentally discovered on CT thorax s/p rib
fractures, PET scan c/w benign process, awaiting interval f/u
CT.
13. [**2-13**] Abdominal US: Diffuse heterogeneous liver, in
conjunction with a markedly dilated portal vein suggesting
intrinsic liver disease and likely portal hypertension.

His father died at age 60 of CAD and one brother died at age 68
of diabetes and CA.

CXR:
The ET tube is about 4.5 cm from the carina. The heart size is
borderline normal. The aorta is tortuous. There are bilateral
diffuse emphysema with interstitial thickening predominantly in
the left lung. There are no pleural effusions. There is no
pneumothorax.

EKG: 80bpm, atrial fibrillation, early R wave progression; ST
depressions in V2-V3 (1mm), nl intervals

IR study: RA pressure 25mm Hg, portal pressure 35mm Hg, no
gastroesophageal varices demonstrated; no filling of varices
with infusion of dye into portal vein
*********
CT abdomen [**10-3**]
1. Patent portal vein. Please note that this examination does
not determine the direction of flow within the portal vein.
2. Focal areas of hyperdensity and linear hypodensity within the
right lobe of the liver, findings that likely relate to the TIPS
attempt of one day prior.
3. Bilateral pleural effusions and bibasilar atelectasis.
4. Stable size of 11-mm left lower lobe pulmonary nodule.
Continued followup is recommended.
5. Ascites.
6. Sigmoid diverticulosis without evidence of diverticulitis.
7. Thickening of the bladder wall. Clinical correlation is
recommended.
**************
[**10-8**] US LIVER
:
1. Heterogenous liver without evidence of focal mass.
2. Distended portal vein that appears patent with normal flow.
Extrahepatic vasculature system is not visualized.
3. Mild splenomegaly.
4. Small amount of ascites that is too small to mark for tap.

****************
CXR [**10-8**]
: AP chest compared to chest films since [**10-3**], most
recently [**10-6**]:

Heterogeneous opacification in both lower lobes has developed
over the past 48 hours accompanied by small right pleural
effusion. Presumptive diagnosis is aspiration. Borderline
cardiomegaly is stable. Upper lobe pulmonary vasculature is not
enlarged and this argues against congestive heart failure. ET
tube, right supraclavicular central venous line in standard
placements. Nasogastric tube passes to the region of the
pylorus. No pneumothorax.

[**2126-10-11**] Video Swallow
[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
81 year old man with recent extubation, question of aspiration
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
pls evaluate for aspiration
INDICATION: Dysphagia, evaluate for aspiration.

VIDEO OROPHARYNGEAL SWALLOW: Fluoroscopic guidance was provided
for the performance of video swallow examination by speech
pathologist. The patient was given thin and nectar thickened
barium liquid, barium pudding, cookies soaked in barium, and a
barium tablet. There was mild to moderate residue in the
vallecula and piriform sinuses. No penetration or aspiration
occurred during swallowing. There is normal laryngeal elevation
and epiglottic deflection. A 12.5 mm barium tablet passes freely
through the esophagus with transient hold up at the
gastroesophageal junction.

IMPRESSION: Mild residue in the vallecula and piriform sinuses
without aspiration or penetration. Please refer to dedicated
speech pathologist report for further evaluation.


Brief Hospital Course:

liver disease.
