History of Present Illness:
77 yo female with extensive PMH including CABG in [**2192**].
Originally seen in [**12-15**] when she had right heart failure/ascites
and was admitted to hospital directly from clinic with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 1290**]. Had a lead extraction at that time with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 914**]
with hope that TR would resolve if lead was removed. Echo [**2-13**]
still showed severe TR. Seen again on [**2-29**] with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] with
last paracentesis done approx. 2 weeks ago prior to PAT. Had
treatment for vertigo earlier in [**Month (only) 958**]. Admitted now for pre-op
workup.

RADIOLOGY  Final Report

CT CHEST W/O CONTRAST
Reason: ? effusion and ? loculated LUL vs infiltrates with low
grade
[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
77 year old woman with s/p tvr
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
? effusion and ? loculated LUL vs infiltrates with low grade
fevers
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: Renal failure
PROCEDURE: CT chest without contrast on [**2196-3-28**].
COMPARISON: [**2196-3-15**] and multiple previous chest
radiographs in between.
TECHNIQUE: Contiguous axial images were obtained from the
thoracic inlet to the subdiaphragmatic area without contrast.
Thinner slice 5 mm and 1.25 mm images were reconstructed in the
axial plane at different window algorithms. Sagittal/coronal
reformatted images were also obtained for further evaluation.
HISTORY: 77-year-old woman with status post TVR questionable
loculated left upper lobe collection versus infiltrate.
FINDINGS:
An endotracheal tube ends 4.5 cm from the carina, a feeding tube
terminates in the stomach, a left transsubclavian PICC line in
the left subclavian vein, and a single lead from a left
pacemaker in the right atrium close to the tricuspid valve.
Four previous chest drainage catheters approaching from the
right subxiphoid location have been removed. Expansion of the
left lung has improved with a decrease in the basal component of
left pleural effusion/hemothorax. However, along the left
lateral costal surface is a persistent high attenuation pleural
or extrapleural collection now containing air as well as fluid.
Another relatively high-density (50 [**Doctor Last Name **]) collection centered in
the anterior mediastinum where the chest tubes previously
coursed has enlarged, now 9cm across and at the site of previous
chest tube entry is a smaller (3cm) loculated hematoma (2:48).
Right pleural effusion is smaller, and atelectasis has improved
minimally. The aerated portions of both lungs are unremarkable.
Although this study is a non-contrast examination yet, there is
an aortic dissection denoted inward displacement of the intimal
calcification extending from the aortic arch into the descending
thoracic and abdominal aorta.
Transverse diameter of the descending aorta, 2.5 cm, (2:54) is
unchanged from the prior examination.
The bony structures do not show any lesions suspicious for
malignancy and/or infection. The limited evaluation of the
abdomen shows a decreased ascites.

IMPRESSION:
1. Enlarging retrosternal/mediastinal hematoma. Stable to
slightly increased, loculated left pleural or extrapleural
collection; new gaseous contents presumably due to chest tube
manipulation.
2. Decreased left basal pleural effusion and/or hemothorax and
right basal pleural effusion with better re-expansion of the
left lung than the right.
3. Chronic thoraco-abdominal aortic dissection.
4. Decreased abdominal ascites.
5. Transsubclavian left PICC line ends in the left subclavian
vein.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST
Reason: assess for cva/bleed
[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
77 year old woman s/p tvr
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
assess for cva/bleed
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.
INDICATION: Status post TVR with change in mental status. Please
evaluate for stroke or hemorrhage.
COMPARISON: Non-contrast head CT of [**2196-3-15**].
FINDINGS: There has been interval development of hypodensity in
the right cerebral hemisphere involving primarily the right
parietal lobe and right occipital lobe extending to the cortex.
These findings are consistent with a subacute embolic
infarction. There is no evidence of hemorrhage, mass effect,
shift of normally midline structures, or hydrocephalus.
Periventricular white matter hypodensity is consistent with
chronic microvascular ischemic changes. The surrounding osseous
structures are unremarkable. The imaged paranasal sinuses are
well aerated.
IMPRESSION: Evolving subacute infarction in the right cerebral
hemisphere, which given its distribution is most likely
secondary to embolus.
At the time of dictation, these findings were discussed with the
cardiovascular team caring for the patient.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

Conclusions
PRE-BYPASS:
1. The left atrium is markedly dilated. No thrombus is seen in
the left atrial appendage. The right atrium is moderately
dilated. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
2. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
3. The right ventricular cavity is dilated with depressed free
wall contractility. There is abnormal diastolic septal
motion/position consistent with right ventricular volume
overload.
4. There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch. There are
simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
5. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with
good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. 6. The
mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral
regurgitation.
7. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Severe
[4+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. The septal leaflet is
restricted and does not coapt with the anterior leaflet. The
tricuspid regurgitation jet is eccentric and may be
underestimat
