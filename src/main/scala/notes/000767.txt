by acute abdominal infections.  She was found to have a
gangrenous right colon status post colectomy with end
ileostomy, second look on [**10-23**] small bowel resection and end
ileostomy preceded by third look, found to have small bowel
perforations times two.  She had multiple bowel resections
with end jejunostomy.  She was placed on a tracheostomy on
[**11-9**] and was noted to have positive Klebsiella sputum
Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas

temperature around 103.0 F., mild abdominal pain, nausea,
vomiting.  No diarrhea and no bright red blood per ostomy.
She was cultured on [**2167-11-4**], and found to have GPCs in
blood and was sent to [**Hospital1 69**].
In the Emergency Room, the patient was noted to be
hypotensive at 80/47, was given Solu-Medrol 125 intravenously
times one, started on Linezolid, Ciprofloxacin and
Ceftazidime with aggressive intravenous volume resuscitation.
Temperature at that time was 103.0 F., heart rate 92;
respiratory rate 23, 92% on three liters nasal cannula.

The patient was admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit
Service for septic shock physiology.

LABORATORY:  She was anemic with a hematocrit of 27.5, white
blood cell count of 13.5 without left shift, hyponatremic at
122.  Potassium 3.8, chloride 86, bicarbonate 27, BUN 15,
creatinine 0.8, glucose 159, lactate 2.3, ALT 27, AST 35,
alkaline phosphatase 110, amylase 52, lipase 19, total
bilirubin 0.7.

Sinus tachycardia on EKG at a rate of 130.  Reciprocal S
waves leads I, II, AVL, V5, V6, right bundle branch block.

Echocardiogram on [**2167-10-20**] revealed an ejection fraction of
greater than 55%, left atrial mild dilatation.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  This is a 70 year old female with coronary
artery disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease status
post lengthy surgical admission requiring multiple bowel
resections, who presented from a rehabilitation facility on
TPN via PICC.  The patient was admitted for a sepsis
protocol.
1.  Started on Dopamine a.d., weaned off [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) **] of greater
than 70; started on Vancomycin to cover Methicillin resistant
Staphylococcus aureus possible line infection.  Outside
hospital microdata revealed six out of six enterococcus
species; later speciated to be pan sensitive as well as three
cultures positive for fungal, later speciated to be C.
albicans.  Repeat blood cultures were drawn on [**12-2**]
and [**1-10**], of which only [**1-5**] revealed C. albicans moderate
growth.

The PICC line was discontinued and culture of tip grown again
positive for fungemia and bacteremia.  In light of high grade
sepsis, the patient was continued on Linezolid initially and
transitioned to Vancomycin to cover enterococcus species.
She was initially started on a dose of amphotericin
transitioned to intravenous fluconazole.  Transthoracic
echocardiogram and transesophageal echocardiogram revealed no
presence of endocarditis or vegetations.

An ophthalmology consultation was obtained to rule out fungal
retinopathy which was negative.  The patient was weaned off
pressors on hospital day one and stabilized.  She was
afebrile on hospital day one with a decreasing white count
and no true evidence of leukocytosis or intra-abdominal
process.  A CT scan of the abdomen was obtained given
patient's multiple anastomoses with concern for abdominal
abscess and/or free fluid collection.  CT scan of the abdomen
revealed no abscess, no fluid collection and no
intra-abdominal process.  Empiric antibiotic coverage was
discontinued at that time.

The patient was weaned off pressors and successfully volume
resuscitated and given one unit of packed red blood cells as
well as normal saline boluses to maintain MAP.  The patient
remained afebrile throughout hospital days two through ten
with no leukocytosis, no physical examination findings
suggestive of intra-abdominal process.  Culture data remained
no growth to date after [**1-6**].  A PICC line was placed on
[**2168-1-12**] via Interventional Radiology.

The patient has per report a history of a penicillin allergy.
On questioning, the patient's allergies were small facial
rash.  Given lack of anaphylactic reaction or hives, a trial
of Ampicillin was performed with 250 mg intravenously times
once.  The patient did not have pruritus, rash, hives or any
evidence of hemodynamic compromise.  Transition from
Vancomycin to Ampicillin 2 grams three times a day was made.
The patient to continue on Intravenous Ampicillin times two
weeks and transition to amoxicillin for an additional two
more weeks at rehabilitation facility.

Anti-fungal [**Doctor Last Name 360**], fluconazole was transitioned from
intravenous to p.o. without sequelae.  Will continue on
fluconazole for remaining four week course as well to be
terminated at same time as amoxicillin.

Note:  In rehabilitation facility, PICC line may be removed
once completion of Ampicillin therapy.

2.  Cardiac:  The patient has a history of percutaneous
transluminal coronary angioplasty with stent.  At outside
hospital EKG with deep S waves and tachycardia.  Cycled
enzymes revealed small troponin leak of 0.04.  In light of
sepsis, likely due to demand ischemia without significant EKG
changes.  Continued on a beta blocker titrated up, metoprolol
and an addition, Lisinopril once blood pressure stabilized
was made.  Hemodynamics remained stable throughout remaining
hospital course.  One event on Telemetry in the Medical
Intensive Care Unit pertinent for a 25 beat of nonsustained
ventricular tachycardia.  Electrolytes were repleted
appropriately.  No further events were recorded on Telemetry.

The patient would benefit from outpatient stress test once
intravenous antibiotics are complete.

3.  Gastrointestinal:  Status post multiple bowel surgeries.
The surgical team is following.  No significant findings on
examination, although in light of extent of resection, the
patient was unable to meet p.o. nutrition requirements on her
own.  The decision to place a G-tube was made on hospital day
seven.  G-tube was placed by General Surgery.  The patient
tolerated the procedure well and began continued tube feeds
with goal of cycle tube feeds at night to meet 100% of
nutritional requirements.  The patient will be able to eat
duri
