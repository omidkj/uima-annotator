Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1974**]
Chief Complaint:
diarrhea, lethargy

History of Present Illness:
This is a 87 y/o female with PMH sig for Parkisons Disease,
Dementia, h/o Recurrent UTIs, with recent [**Hospital1 18**] admission
[**2197-8-5**]->[**2197-8-9**] for hypotension and UTI. During this admission,
she was admitted for lethargy and found to have a systolic BP in
the upper 50s. Her hypotension resolved by the time she was
admitted to the medical team, and the thought was that it may
have been d/t medicince effect from changes in her
antihypertensive. Her EKG was without evidence of acute ischemia
and she ruled out for a myocardial infarction. Her lisinopril,
atenolol and norvasc were decreased and she remained
normotensive on this admission. In addition, she was found on
urine culture to have a Urinary tract infection with E. coli.
She was treated with levofloxacin, to complete a 7 day course.
.
She now presents from NH with hypotension, increasing lethargy,
diarrhea and fever. ROS and HPI are extremely limited as patient
is not able to relate history. Initial VS in the ED: 100R, 74,
61/30 24 95% RA. Initial Lactate was 3.4 which decreased to 2.5
after IVF fluids. Labs revealing for new leucocytosis (WBC of
19.9 from 6.2 on discharge) along with new ARF (1.2-->2.8)
.
In the ED, the pt was given CTX (which the E coli is susecptible
to) along with Flagyl. She received aggresse IVF resuscitation
with increased in her BP to 110s systolic.

Brief Hospital Course:
1) SEPSIS:
Pt was initially treated on floor for UTI but then transferred
to the ICU for septic shock with hypotension, decreased urine
output.  Pt was put on broad spectrum antibiotics to cover UTI
as well as C diff.  She was on ceftriaxone for E/ coli UTI as
well as IV vanco.
Her hypotension resolved.  She remained AF and WBC normalized.
Her repeat urine cultures were negative and she completed 10d
course of ceftriaxone for the UTI.
.
2) C DIFF:
Pt had positive C diff toxin early in the admission and was
started on flagyl and PO vanco.  However, treatment of her Cdiff
was prolonger by intervening antibiotics for other infections.
At discharge she requires about 8 more days of vanco and flaygl.
.
3) GI BLEED:
Pt also developed a lower GI bleed while in the ICU. Her hct
remained stable but she had BRBPR.  A colonoscopy showed C diff
colitis and ischemic colitis resulting in friable mucosa.  As
her sepsis resolved and c diff was treated, she had no further
lower GI bleed.
.
4) ANEMIA:
Initially, her HCt was around 30 and stable.  By discharge, it
ranged from 23 to 25 but was stable.  Iron studies show anemia
of chronic disease.  There is no active bleeding.
.
5) PNEUMONIA:  After leaving the ICU, pt developed an elevated
WBC.  CXR showed possible pneumonia so she was treated with
ceftriaxone and vanco initially and then switched to cipro.  Her
WBC normalized and resp secretions decreased.
.
6) PICC site infection:  She developed exudate at site of PICC.
Culture showed pseudomonas.  Treated with cipro.  PICC changed
to new site.
.
7) cardiac arrhythmia:
EKG [**8-25**] appeared to be possible a-fib c RVR (105) and compared
to prior EKG done on admission which was read by a cardiologist
(sinus rhythm c freq. atrial ectopy), does appear to be more
irregularly irregular. Pt without symptoms during this episode.
Subsequently in NSR c frequent PACs. Thus do not believe a-fib
an element to pt's hypotension. If pt does go into a-fib, would
not be a good candidate for anticoagulation given current
bleeding from below and fall risk.
.
8) HTN: Holding home antihypertensives (amlodipine 2.5 mg,
lisinopril 2.5 mg, atenolol 12.5 mg [**Hospital1 **]) given overall
malnutrition, initial hypotension.  Can be restarted as outpt
once BP in stable range.
.
9) Dementia/Parkinsons:  For much of the hospitalization,
sinemet was held due to inability to take POs.  This was
restarted once PEG placed.
.
10) MALNUTRUTION:  Pt suffered from severe malnutrition, likely
long standing and exacerbated by acute illness.  Albumin<2.0.
She was likely not getting sufficient nutrition PO.  She is also
high aspiration risk and should not take any POs.  PEG placed
and started on TFs.
.
11) ANASARCA:  DEveloped while in septic shock but persisted due
to hypoalbunemia.  Did not attempt diuresis given low albumin.
Once nutritional status improved, expect some degree of
autodiuresis which can be assisted with diuretics if needed.
.
12) CODE STATUS:  Initially full code, after family meeting week
before discharge, made DNR/DNI
