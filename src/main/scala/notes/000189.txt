CC:[**CC Contact Info **]
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
CT Guided Thoracentesis
Bronchoscopy
Central line placement

History of Present Illness:
75 yo F w/PMH R pleural effusion, CAD, CHF (EF 55), DM, ESRD on
HD recent admission from [**Date range (1) 96973**] w/MRSA sepsis on
vancomycin(??osteomyelitis) now admitted for fever, shortness of
breath and cough.
.
At the NH, her fever was found to be 102.8. On presentation to
ED, her VS were T98.3 P68 BP106/41 R 14 and 96% on 2L. She
received 2L of NS and zosyn in ED.
.
Patient went for bronchoscopy today for RLL collapse which
showed severe tracheobronchomalacia on tidal respiration.
Pigtail was unable to be done. She then went to dialysis which
removed 1.5L of fluid. Dialysis was stopped early because she
was shivering and feeling cold. Upon return to the floor, she
required increased oxygen support, 92% on 6L(95% on 2L the same
AM), tachypneic to 40s and also hypertensive to 170s. Her ABG
showed 7.32/63/60 on 6L. She was given nebs x1 with no
improvement.
.
The patient reports increased cough, occassionally productive of
clear phlegm/sputum over the past several days. She also notes
increasing shortness of breath. She denies chest pain, PND,
orthopnea, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, urinary
symptoms(she does have minimal urine output), headahce,
dizziness.

[**7-29**] transudative (attempted tap x 3 without success, on fourth
attempt were able to remove 200cc only) - on 2L oxygen at NH
- CAD: cath [**11-26**] with 3VD, s/p cypher [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] 2 to RCA.

[**11-26**] on HD since [**12-28**] (baseline creatinine ([**2-24**])
- Severe lumbar spondylosis and spinal stenosis s/p laminectomy

in [**2110**]
- Basal Cell Carcinoma
- Osteomyelitis T5-T6 on suppressive vancomycin for 3 months
([**2113-4-13**] was day 1)
- MRSA bacteremia from HD line infection
- Admission [**Date range (1) 96974**] for MRSA sepsis. At that time, the
patient had back pain and their was concern for osteomyelitis.
She refused an MRI so was discharged on 6 weeks of abx.

CTA Chest: IMPRESSION:
1. Almost complete atelectasis of the right lung due to
secretion in right main bronchi.

2. Longstanding loculated right pleural effusion with
homogeneous pleural thickening, unchanged.

3. Steadily increasing mediastinal lymph nodes, and pleural
thickening might have a benign explanation due to longstanding
pleural effusion. An indolent malignancy such as lymphoma cannot
be excluded, justifying thoracentesis and cytologic cell-block
examination.
.
CXR [**2114-12-7**]:
Portable AP chest radiograph compared to [**2114-12-3**].

Left PICC line tip terminates at the junction of the
brachiocephalic vein and SVC. The left lung is unremarkable. The
right pleural effusion again demonstrated with adjacent lung
atelectasis, slightly increased comparing to the previous film.
No evidence of pneumothorax is present.
.
Cytology: Negative for malignant cells

Brief Hospital Course:
75yo F with ESRD on HD, CAD, CHF, HTN, chronic right sided
effusion and R lung collapse, s/p bronch showing
tracheobronchomalacia, transferred to MICU for acute
exacerbation of hypoxia.
.
MICU COURSE:
# Acute exacerbation of hypoxia - correctable w/ O2(baseline
home O2 2L: initial DDX on admission included acute mucus plug,
worsening pneumonia/pulmonary edema, worsening collapse,
fever/high metabolic rate, PE. CXR show persistent RML and RLL
collapse, no PTX; bronch [**11-28**] show severe TBM.  Patient was
given aggressive pulmonary toillette.  There was some
improvement in her hypoxia however she continued to require
oxygen.  She underwent a CT guided thoracentesis with pigtail
placement which revealed a transudate.  There was a concern for
trapped lung and not much improvement in her oxygenation.  She
was also treated with vanc/zosyn for 7 days for possible PNA.
.
# Longstanding loculated right pleural effusion with homogeneous
pleural thickening w/ enlarging mediastinal [**Doctor First Name **] - As above pig
tail placed under CT guidance but no relief.  Likely trapped
lung.
.
# ESRD on HD QMWF: last HD [**11-28**].  Renal followed patient while
she was admitted.  Continued epogen, calcitriol, folic acid.
# CAD: continue on plavix
# DM- continue on insulin sc
# thrombocytopenia: DIC lab negative, patient has history of
HIT.
# Anxiety:continued on citalopram, clonazepam
# spinal stenosis: on morphine at baseline
# PPX-PPI, pneumoboots
# code- DNR/DNI.
-----
During the day [**12-4**] patient went into A. fib with RVR upto 160s
and dropped her systolic bp to 60s.  Given patients prior wishes
and after discussion with the family and PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) **], the
decision was made to change her goals of care to comfort
measures. All her regular medications were discontinued and she
was started on a morphine drip with titration to comfort. The
patient was transferred to the medical floor where this care
goal was continued. This was confirmed with family. On HOD #11,
patient expired.
