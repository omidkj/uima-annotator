No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 425**]
Chief Complaint:
s/p PEA arrest

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **] yof with history of HTN, DM, hypothyriodism, BIBEMS to OSH ED
s/p witnessed PEA at home.  Per report, she was in her usual
state of health till 2pm on [**2141-12-2**], after returning from
shopping all day.  Her husband fell onto her and caused her to
fell.  She banged her head against the wall on her way down.
Her granddaughter was present during this time and called 911.
Fire department arrived in 2 minutes, found patient to be
non-responsive without a pulse and apnec.  She received CPR via
BLS for 2 mins.  When ACLS arrived noted patient to be
unresponsive, in sinus brady, no shock was delivered.
.
Once arrived to OSH ED, she was given 80 of succ and 80 of
propofol for RSI (7.5, 24cm at lip, position confirmed - 1 cm
from carina).  Repeat rhythm was in NSR rate of 60-40.  Head CT
was wnl, noted for C3-C6 fusion.  Abd US noted to have calcified
aorta without dissection.  Patient was noted to be unresponsive
per report of OSH, and not moving her limbs.  Cooling was
initiated at 1645 for a baseline of 35 with a goal of 33, this
was done with 2L of cold NS.  Patient was given veccuronium,
versed, propafol.  EKG showed sinus, first degree AV block,
normal ST-T waves, LAD.  Labs were significant for WBC of 5.7,
H&H of 8.8 and 26.7.  Chem7 was Na 137, K 4.4, Cl 107, HC03 21,
BUN 31, cr 1.2, glu 154.  Trop of 0.01.  ABG of 7.38, pCO2 of
38, pO2 483, HCO3 23.  At this point, she was transferred to
[**Hospital1 18**] for further managment.
.
In our ED, her inital vitals were: brady 30-40 SR, BP 130-140,
sats 100% FiO2 of 40%, PEEP of 5.  Temp was noted to be 32.8C
with ice packs, and HR showed persistent bradycardia, cooling
was temporarily stopped, then restarted.  Echo was performed in
the ED by cardiology fellow: The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion
abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). The right ventricle
appears slightly enlarged but is contracting well; [**Last Name (un) 13367**]
sign is absent. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. There is a very small
pericardial effusion. There are no echocardiographic signs of
tamponade.  Labs were similar to OSH.  pH of 7.45, PCO2 26, PO2
175, HCO3 of 17.  Lactate of 0.9.  Access 18x2, 20.  I/O
1.5L/1.25.

ECHO [**12-2**] There is symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The
left ventricular cavity size is normal. Due to suboptimal
technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be
fully excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
normal (LVEF 65%). There is no ventricular septal defect. The
right ventricular free wall is hypertrophied. The right
ventricular cavity is dilated with borderline normal free wall
function. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate [2+] tricuspid
regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure
could not be determined. There is a very small pericardial
effusion. There is an anterior space which most likely
represents a prominent fat pad.

CXR [**12-2**] Single supine AP portable view of the chest was
obtained.
Endotracheal tube is seen, terminating approximately the 3.3 cm
above the
level of the carina. Nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the
level of the diaphragm, distal aspect not included on the image.
Right perihilar opacity may relate to atelectasis or
consolidation from aspiration, less likely infection. The left
lung is clear. No large pleural effusion is seen, although a
trace effusion may be difficult to exclude. The cardiac
silhouette is mildly enlarged. The aorta is calcified and
tortuous.

Brief Hospital Course:
[**Age over 90 **]yo F with history of HTN, DM, hypothyroidism presents s/p
cardiac arrest on cooling protocol, now deceased.

#PEA arrest - Patient was found to be pulseless after her
husband fell on top of her prior to admission.  She received CPR
in the field but no medications or shocks.  She was brought to
an OSH where she was intubated and received 2L of chilled NS for
post-arrest cooling protocol, she was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for
further management.  The precise etiology of her arrest is not
known, however it is not thought to be ischemic.  Here, she was
started on dopamine for hypotension and cooling protocol was
continued for 24 hours via Arctic Sun.  She was rewarmed and
sedation was weaned, her mental status began to slowly improve.
TTE after cooling showed a preserved EF with no wall motion
abnornalities.  There was briefly concern for PE on her repeat
TTE, but CTA chest did not show a PE.

#Neurologic status - She was reported to be not moving her
extremities in the field prior to arrival at the OSH, which is
why the cooling protocol was initiated after her arrest.  After
rewarming was complete, versed and fentanyl were weaned and her
mental status slowly improved, although she had movement in all
4 extremities.  Head CT did not show any acute changes.
Continuous EEG during and after cooling did not show evidence of
seizure.  Neurology was consulted and they felt that sh
