CXR [**1-26**]: Lungs are hyperexpanded consistent with emphysema.
Lungs are clear without consolidation or pleural effusion.  The
heart size is normal. There is no hilar or mediastinal
enlargement.  Aortic tortuosity is unchanged. Aortic arch
calcifications are noted.  Pulmonary vascularity is normal.
IMPRESSION: Emphysema. No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.


Brief Hospital Course:
65 year old woman with a history of COPD, schizophrenia,
presented with tachypnea without dyspnea and no documented
desaturations.
.
#. Tachypnea: there was no acute process on CXR, no history of
fevers, and normal WBC count. She unlikely had a pneumonia.
However, at presentation, COPD exacerbation seemed likely and
she was treated with levofloxacin, prednisone, and standing
nebulizers.  D dimer was elevated but has also been elevated on
prior admissions. There was a very low likelihood of PE so she
did not have a CT scan.  Although she had oxygen saturation of
90's during the course of her admission, this was thought to be
her baseline secondary to severe baseline COPD and continued
smoking. Given her unusual presentation and lack of any
indications to suggest infection, tachypnea was felt to be most
likely secondary to anxiety/psychiatric illness.  She was ruled
out for a cardiac event with two negative cardiax enzymes. The
urine toxicology and serum toxicology were negative and liver
function tests were within normal limits.  Sputum culture sent,
and results are pending at the time of discharge. The patient
requested discharge upon transfer to the floor as she felt great
with no dyspnea or tachypnea. Her O2 was 92 on RA with
ambulation without tachypnia or SOB. She was discharged based on
her request.
.
# Weakness: Unclear cause of weakness, although patient's poor
effort on exam suggests that psychiatric illness may be playing
a role.  Physical therapy evaluation requested.
.
#. Schizophrenia: Psychiatry evaluated patient and confirmed
medications; meds intially held, but then restarted on home dose
abilify and trazodone.
.
#. MAT: Continued diltiazem, ASA.
