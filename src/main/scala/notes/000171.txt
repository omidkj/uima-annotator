History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 59yo male with history of insulin dependent DM,
on albuterol inhaler at home, who presented to ED with 3 day
history of fever, dyspnea, and non-productive cough.  Patient
had called EMS tonight for increased coughing, and was brought
to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation.  Patient reports receiving a
flu vaccine on Thursday prior to admission. After receiving the
flu shot, patient reports developing subjective fever without
chills. For the past 3 days, the patient has noticed cough with
white sputum production. In the past day or two, he reports
muscle aches making him unable to bend down to tie his shoes. He
denies DOE or dyspnea at rest. He has not noticed rashes. He
denies sick contacts. [**Name (NI) **] has had poor appetite the past 2 days.
He denies nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain.
.
In the ED, initial VS were: 100.1 96 173/84 24 100% 15L, though
his respiratory rate decreased with talking (to 30s).  Patient
denied any CP.  Exam notable for tachypnea and rhonchi.  Labs
notable for leukocytosis with WBC 12.9 with 78% N, 15.9% L. In
the ED, the patient was started on ceftriaxone and azithromycin.
He also received albuterol/ipratropium nebs times 2 in the ED
and was started on IV methylprednisolone. Blood and urine
cultures were drawn as well; UA from the ED was not concerning
for UTI. CXR was limited secondary to body habitus, though there
was no appreciable consolidations or effusions.
.
VS prior to transfer: 98 159/61 100% CPAP RR 45, when talking RR
30s.
.
On arrival to the MICU, patient has CPAP in place; VS upon
arrival to the MICU: T 100.0 (Ax) HR 97 BP 125/77 RR 31 (RR
decreased to 20s w/ conversation) O2 Sat 96% via FM at 8L.
Patient reports that he feels better since arrival in the ED. He
is currently receiving nebulizer treatment via FM.
.
Of note, the patient has never formally been diagnosed with
asthma, though he uses his albuterol inhaler twice daily. He is
currently not using CPAP at home as insurance is no longer
covering this. Patient had ECHO in [**4-/2109**] that did not show
evidence of pulmonary HTN. PFTs have been variable in the past
and show a restrictive pattern.
.
Review of systems:
(+) For urinary frequency.
(-) Denies chills, night sweats, recent weight loss or gain.
Denies headache, sinus tenderness, rhinorrhea or congestion.
Denies chest pain, chest pressure, palpitations, or weakness.
Denies nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, abdominal pain,
or changes in bowel habits. Denies dysuria or urgency. Denies
rashes or skin changes.


Past Medical History:
-- DM, insulin dependent; complicated by retinopathy and renal
insufficiency
-- HTN with ECHO ([**4-/2109**]) evidence of LV Hypertrophy
-- HLD
-- Obesity
-- Hypercalcemia
-- Sleep Apnea on CPAP
-- renal insufficiency [**2-6**] poorly controlled DM
-- retinopathy [**2-6**] poorly controlled DM
-- glaucoma
-- Restrictive lung disease on PFTs, which was thought to be due
to his obesity. Of note, PFTshave been somewhat unreliable due
to inadequate test performance. Suspicion for parenchymal lung
disease is minimal on pulmonary note from [**12-14**].


Social History:
Lives in [**Location 686**]. Unemployed (former merchant marine).
Married with 7 year-old boy.
