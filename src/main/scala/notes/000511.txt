significant for ETOH level of 239. He had a normal WBC count,
HCT of 29, Chem 7, LFTs unremarkable and troponin negative x1.
Serum and urine tox negative. UA negative. ABG 7.36/47/64 with
lactate of 2. Patient was initially volume recussitated with 4L
of NS with improvement of blood pressures to the 80s. He was

Radiology Report CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST Study Date of
[**2192-6-20**] 4:05 PM
IMPRESSION:
1.  No evidence of pulmonary embolism although evaluation of
subsegmental
arteries in right lower lobe is suboptimal due to patient
respiratory motion.
2.  Prominent bilateral hilar and mediastinal lymph nodes some
of which are enlarged. Recommend clinical correlation with
history of prior infection, inflammatory process, or concern for
malignancy and further evaluation per clinical history.
Findings should be followed-up.
3.  Cardiomegaly without pericardial effusion or acute aortic
syndrome.
4.  Thickened-appearing bladder wall. Correlate with urinalysis.
