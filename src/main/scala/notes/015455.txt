History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **] year old male with DM, CKD, CAD, CHF (EF 25%) p/w acute on
chronic renal failure and hypotension (SBP 50s).  He was being
diuresed with Lasix 100 mg PO BID and zaroxolyn 5 mg PO BID at
[**Hospital 100**] Rehab for CHF exacerbation with good urine output for 1.5
weeks, but was noted to have rising creatinine starting [**12-1**]
(2.0), which was up to 4.2 on [**2113-12-5**].  He also has had waxing
and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] mental status x 1 week, different from his normal
clear MS per his son.  [**Name (NI) 8389**] was placed the day prior to
admission and the patient had only about 75ml of urine despite
an 800cc fluid challenge.  A left midline was also placed on
[**2113-12-5**].  He was given an additional 250cc fluid with no
response.  He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further w/u of renal
failure.

Of note, he completed a course of Levofloxacin on [**2113-12-2**] for a
RLL Pna.  He was noted to have loose stool on [**12-4**], with
negative Cdiff toxin on [**2113-12-4**].

Upon arrival to [**Hospital1 18**] ed, vitals were T98.7  BP 50s/palp, HR 62
RR 17, 91% 6L NC.  Per [**Hospital 100**] Rehab his baseline BP is 120/60.
A fresh foley was placed in the ED and about 700-800cc bloody
urine returned.  U/A was postive for blood and moderate leuks.
He received 1.5L NS and started on dopamine via a PICC line.  He
received a dose of vanco and zosyn to cover broadly for sepsis.
 He was sent for CT abdomen with oral contrast prior to
admission to MICU.

Studies:
CXR [**2113-12-6**]: Mild CHF; Despite the given history, a right-sided
PICC is not seen.

Abd x-ray [**2113-12-6**]: Non-obstructive bowel gas pattern with
moderately dilated stomach.

CT abd w/oral contrast only, [**2113-12-6**]:
1.  Nonspecific inflammatory stranding and fascial thickening
around the right kidney and proximal right ureter without
hydronephrosis or stones.  Assessment for underlying infection
or urothelial mass is significantly limited without IV contrast,
and cannot be excluded.
2.  Bilateral renal cysts.
3.  Marked prostatic enlargement with evidence of chronic
bladder outlet obstruction including bladder wall thickening and
trabeculation.  Assessment for underlying bladder wall mass is
limited without IV contrast and given the decompressed state of
the bladder.
4. Consolidation at the visualized lung bases, left greater than
right, concerning for pneumonia/aspiration.
5. Lipoma along the proximal right femoral metadiaphysis

Brief Hospital Course:
[**Age over 90 **] y.o. man with CAD, CHF, DM, p/w hypotension and acute on
chronic renal failure.

Hypotension: The patients hypotension was originally thought
most likely secondary to sepsis.  He was started on
vanco/cefepime/flagyl.  Suspected sources were urosepsis given
retained urine (and positive UA) or colitis (cdiff) given recent
abx and diarrhea.  The patient was hydrated and briefly on
dopamine for hypotension.  This was quickly weaned off and the
patient was volume resusitated.   His urine eventually grew
Proteus sensitive to ceftriaxone (see results section for full
sensitivies).  His vancomycin was discontinued.  He remains on
flagyl for now until stool cultures are able to be sent (did not
have BM while at [**Hospital1 18**]).

Acute on chronic renal failure: Baseline cr 1.6.  The patient
was admitted with a creatinine of 4.6.  He was likely pre-renal
secondary over diuresis while at rehab and infection
(urosepsis).  The patient creatinine was trending down at the
time of discharge after volume resusitation.

Urinary Retention: The patient had urinary retention at the time
of admission and needed a foley placed.  His prostate was noted
to be large on CT abdomen.  A foley was kept in at the time fo
discharge.  He was started on proscar and will need follow up in
the [**Hospital 159**] Clinic in [**12-6**] weeks.

Altered mental status: likely multifactorial, including
infection, toxic metabolic (uremia).  Was slowly improving at
the time of discharge.

CHF, ef 25%: Per [**Hospital1 1501**] records, dry weight around 260-264 lbs.
Admission wt 255.  Bibasilar crackles are likely chronic.  His
carvedilol, lisinopril, lasix, and metolazone were held on this
admission because of his hypotension.  These should all be added
back as tolerated.
