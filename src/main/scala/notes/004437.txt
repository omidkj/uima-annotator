Allergies:
Percodan

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 11495**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
s/p cardiac cath x 2


History of Present Illness:
58 y/o male with PMH significant for hyperlipidemia and atrial
fibrillation was driving near [**Hospital3 **] when he experienced [**9-21**]
substernal crushing chest pain, shortness of breath associated
with profuse sweating.  He says the pain persisted, unabated,
for 15 minutes, wherein he pulled off the road to the nearest
emergency room at [**Hospital6 33**].  He states he has never
had a pain like this before.  At [**Hospital1 34**], he was given MSO4, NTG SL
X3, NTG gtt, ASA and hep gtt without relief.  His vitals at the
time were 131/97 HR 68, no murmur or extra heart sounds were
appreciated on exam there.
.
His swan was pulled after cath, and he has no CP/SOB currently.
No palpitations/N/V.  No diaphoresis.  Only complaint is
persistent cough.
.
He says that his cardiologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 62285**], at [**Location (un) 511**] Med
Center, did a stress MIBI one month ago, which was WNL.  The pt
has h/o Afib, rate controlled with toprol and rhythmol, no
anticoagulation, although he says his cardiologist was going to
start anti-coag.  He reports being started on digoxin in the
past, without benefit.  He intermittently feels palpitations
with his Afib, usually occurring 2x/month.  He has never been
cardioverted.  He sleeps on 1 pillow. No PND.  No peripheral
edema per pt.

Pertinent Results:
Coronary Cath ([**2133-7-30**]). Selective coronary angiography in the
co-dominant circulation revealed two vessel disease. The LMCA is
without angiographically apparent flow limiting disease. The
proximal LAD is without flow limiting disease, but the mid LAD
has an 80% stenosis after the take-off of the D1. The distal LAD
has a 30-40% stenosis. The D1 has mild luminal irregularities.
The LCx was totally occluded with thrombus proximally before any
branches. The RCA was without flow limiting disease
throughout its course. The R-PDA and R-PL were also without
significant
flow limiting disease. There was back filling of the L-PDA and
LCx via
collaterals from the distal RCA, however, the OM was not filled.

2. Resting hemodynamics from right and left catheterization
demonstrated
moderate pulmonary arterial hypertension (59/30mmHg) and
elevated right
and left heart filling pressures (RVEDP=22mmHg, mean
PCWP=34mmHg). Very
large v waves (53mmHg) were noted on the PCWP tracing indicating
severe
mitral regurgitation. The calculated cardiac output by the Fick
method
was 4.2 L/min with a cardiac index of 1.8.
3. Successful thrombectomy and PTCA of the LCX and OM1. Final
angiography revealed the LCX and all of its branch vessels
except for
the lPDA to be widely patent with no residual stenosis, no
apparent
dissection and normal flow (see PTCA comments).

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Two vessel coronary artery disease with co-dominant
circulation.
2. Severe mitral regurgitation given large v waves on PCWP
tracings.
3. Depressed cardiac output (CI=1.8)
4. Elevated right and left heart filling pressures.
5. Moderate pulmonary arterial hypertension.
6. Succesful thrombectomy and PTCA of the LCX and OM1.

Coronary Cath ([**2133-8-3**]): 1. Selective angiography of the left
coronary circulation revealed 2
vessel disease. The LMCA had mild luminal irregularities. The
LAD had a
70% stenosis just after D1. The LCX was free of significant
angiographic
disease until the distal vessel where the site of occlusion at
the
completion of the procedure on [**2133-7-30**] had recanalized and was
now
subtotally occluded.
2. Limited resting hemodynamics revealed normal systemic
arterial
pressures.
3. Successful direct stenting of the LAd witha 3.5 x 18 mm
Cypher DES
which was postdilated proximally to 4.0 mm. Final angiography
revealed
no residual stenosis, no apparent dissection, and normal flow
(see PTCA
comments).
4. Successful PTCA of the distal LCX. Final angiography revealed
a 30%
residula stenosis, no apparent dissection and normal flow (see
PTCA
comments).
5. Successful closure of the left common femoral arteriotomy
with an 8
French Angioseal device.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Two vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Successful placement of a drug-eluting stent in the LAD.
3. Successful PTCA of the LCX.

INTERPRETATION:
Findings:
LEFT ATRIUM: Moderate LA enlargement.
RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Normal RA size.
LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thicknesses and cavity size.
Moderate regional
LV systolic dysfunction.
LV WALL MOTION: Regional LV wall motion abnormalities include:
basal inferior  - akinetic; mid inferior - akinetic; basal
inferolateral - akinetic; mid inferolateral - akinetic; septal
apex - hypo;
RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.
AORTA: Normal aortic root diameter. Mildly dilated aortic arch.
No 2D or
Doppler evidence of distal arch coarctation.
AORTIC VALVE: Normal aortic valve leaflets (3). Trace AR.
MITRAL VALVE: Normal mitral valve leaflets. No MVP. Mild (1+)
MR.
TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets with trivial
TR. Normal PA  systolic pressure.
PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflets
with
physiologic PR.
PERICARDIUM: Trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
GENERAL COMMENTS: Based on [**2124**] AHA endocarditis prophylaxis
recommendations,  the echo findings indicate a low risk
(prophylaxis not recommended). Clinical decisions regarding the
need for prophylaxis should be based on clinical and
echocardiographic data.
Conclusions:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There is moderate
regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with severe
hypokinesis of the basal half of the inferior and inferolateral
walls and distal septum. The remaining segments are mildly
hypokinetic. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal.  The aortic arch is mildly dilated. The aortic
leaflets (3) are thin and mobile. Trace aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. There
is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is
normal. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
58 y/o man with h/o hyperlipidemia, atrial fibrillation,
admitted for chest pain, thrombectomy in cath for LCX lesion
with 80% LAD lesion not stented, complicated by elevated PCWP
and V waves, with concern for papillary dysfunction.
1.  Cardiac:
A. Coronary: Pt underwent thrombectomy of LCX artery, which
showed the presence of thrombus, but no underlying coronary
lesion.  Thrombectomy was performed, with embolization into
distal LCX and OM1, with occlusion of the LPDA.  The patient was
also noted to have an 80% LAD lesion, which was not believed to
be contributing to the patient's symptoms.  He was continued on
Aspirin, integrillin x 18hours, and plavix.  Upon resolution of
the problems below, he was taken back to the cath lab on [**8-3**],
with cypher stents placed in the LAD and LCX into the LPDA.  He
tolerated both procedures well and is discharged on plavix,
aspirin, statin, as well as toprol XL.
