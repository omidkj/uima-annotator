EKG [**1-3**]
Sinus tachycardia. Otherwise, normal tracing. No previous
tracing available for comparison.
.
[**1-3**] CXR
IMPRESSION: Left basilar opacification may be atelectasis
although pneumonia cannot be completely excluded. Consider
repeat PA and lateral with encouraged inspiration. Repeat
lateral may help locate the tip of the OG tube which is only
seen to the level of the distal esophagus.
.
[**1-5**] CXR
FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient
has been
extubated. The nasogastric tube has also been removed. The size
of the
cardiac silhouette is unchanged. There is unchanged atelectasis
at the left lung base. No evidence of pneumothorax, no newly
appeared focal parenchymal opacity. An older very subtle opacity
at the bases of the right upper lobe is slightly better seen
than on the previous examination.


Brief Hospital Course:
Assessment and Plan: 67 hypertension and heavy alcohol use who
presents from home with hematemasis and melena.

Upper gastrointestinal bleeding: On admission to the MICU
patient was tachycardic with stable blood pressure. He was
started on IV pantoprazole, an octreotide drip, and 3 large bore
IVs were placed. Upper endoscopy showed ulcer in stomach with
nearby vessels suspicious for recent bleed, which was injected
with epinephrine and electrocautery was performed. Patient was
intubated during procedure due to difficulty tolerating
procedure (not due to hypoxia or respiratory distress). Hct's
were serially checked and stable. No further episodes of
bleeding. He was transfered to the floor on [**2190-1-6**].

On arrival to the floor her was asymptomatic and hemodynamically
stable.  His diet was advanced and he was switched to oral
medications.  H. pylori serology was positive and he was treated
with pantoprazole, clarithromycin and ammoxicillin. He had an
epsiode of melena with some bright red blood on [**2190-1-7**].
Serial hematocrits were stable between 28 at 31% and he had no
repeat episodes of melena or hematochezia.

Pneumonia: Patient had L sided infiltrate on CXR, subjective
productive cough, and temperature of 100.3 and a sputum gram
stain was positve for Moraxella. He was started on a five day
course of levofloxacin.  Once H. pylori serologies were
positive, he was started on triple therapy and levofloxacin was
stopped as amoxicillin and clarithromycin provided adequate CAP
coverage.

Wheezing/Hypoxia: On arrival to the floor, patient had
significant bilateral wheezing and was dependent on supplemental
oxygen, with an oxygen saturation of 95% on 3L NC.  Of note, he
describes becoming short of breath at home walking up one flight
of stairs, and that this has been a chronic problem for many
years.  He was treated with his home dose of
salmeterol/fluticasone, and given albuterol/ipratropium
nebulizer treatments.  His breathing improved substantially, and
was able to ambulate with assistance and supplemental oxygen on
the floor.  He will likely require pulmonary function tests and
further treatment for possible COPD as an outpatient.  He was
discharged with supplemental oxygen and home physical therapy.

Hypertension: Patient was hypertensive on arrival to the floor
with SBP 140-170.  He was restarted on his home dose of
lisinopril 40mg PO daily, and his blood pressure decreased to a
SBP of 110-140.

History of alcohol abuse: No history of withdrawal. Last drink
per repo
