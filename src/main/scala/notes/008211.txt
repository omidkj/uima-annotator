Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 348**]
Chief Complaint:
found down, admitted earlier [**12-4**] with SOB

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation, chest tube placement (bilateral), central line
placement, PICC placement, IV antibiotics


History of Present Illness:
64M homeless h/o COPD, asthma, EtOH abuse who was BIBA on [**12-4**]
complaining of SOB for 2 days and admitted to the MICU for
elevated lactate 4.5 and presumed COPD flare. See [**2104-12-4**]
resident admission note summarized this admission. Briefly, he
was hypoxic in the ED to 83% but improved on 2L NC. The patient
became agitated and was given 2mg ativan and admitted to the
ICU. On arrival he was somnolent but arousable to touch. He was
started on treatment for COPD flare with steroids, inhalers, and
antibiotics. Later in the evening he awoke and demanded to sign
out AMA. Bedside evaluation by the resident and attending was
performed and it was deemed that he was A&Ox3 and understood the
risks and benefits of leaving the hospital, including imminent
death. He was given a nebulizer treatment prior to leaving and
was escorted to the lobby by his nurse.

In the lobby, the nurse reported that the patient stated he felt
unwell and then quickly slumped to the ground. He was
incontinent of urine and there were some myoclonic movements of
his left arm. A code blue was called. He initially had a pulse
and was breathing spontaneously and so he was transported to the
ED. In transit, he developed PEA arrest and CPR was initiated
and he was intubated. He was given 3 rounds of epinephrine and
atropine. After brief asystole he converted to VT and was
shocked 3x with restoration of perfusing rhythm (total code time
estimated at 15 min). Amiodarone was also given. A right femoral
line was placed. Given hypotension he was started on
neosynephrine gtt with improvement. CXR revealed a right
pneumothorax and a tube thoracostomy was performed. He was
initiated on the Arctic Sun protocol and received vecuronium
bolus. Labs notable for lactate 8.3, K 6.0, ABG 7.29/36/129.
Admitted to ICU for further management.

ROS: Unable to assess due to intubation, sedation.

STUDIES:
[**2104-12-4**] ECG: Sinus tachycardia. Inferior wall myocardial
infarcin, age indeterminate.  Prolonged Q-T interval compared to
the previous tracing of [**2104-3-30**].

[**2104-12-5**] CXR: IMPRESSION: Right pneumothorax with probable
tension. Findings were discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in the ED
immediately upon completion of the exam.

[**2104-12-5**] CXR: IMPRESSION:
1. Interval placement of right pleural tube that appears to be
located in the medial sulcus and may need to be pulled back.
2. Smaller right pneumothorax, with new extensive right chest
wall
subcutaneous emphysema.
3. Resolving right mid lung contusion.

[**2104-12-5**] CXR: There is a new large left tension pneumothorax
with complete collapse of the left lung. The cardiomediastinal
structures are shifted towards the right side. ET tube and NG
tube remain in place. There is new left subcutaneous emphysema.
Right subcutaneous emphysema has increased. There is a small
right pneumothorax, and right chest tube remains in place.
This examination was read in conjunction with the followup study
performed 20 minutes after this, and in the followup study,
there is a chest tube in the left chest with almost complete
re-expansion of the left lung.

[**2104-12-6**] Head CT without contrast - IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of acute intracranial abnormalities.
2. Fluid in the paranasal sinuses, which is a common finding in
intubated
patients. Superimposed infection cannot be excluded by imaging.

[**2104-12-7**] CXR: ET tube is in good position with its tip about 4.5
cm above the carina. Bilateral tubes are seen. Extensive
subcutaneous emphysema. No convincing evidence of pneumothorax
on either side. Likely background COPD. NG tube in good
position. No real change from the prior radiograph.

[**2104-12-8**] IMPRESSION: Uncomplicated fluoroscopically guided PICC
line exchange for a new 5 French double-lumen PICC line. Final
internal length is 43 cm, with the tip positioned in the SVC.
The line is ready to use.

[**2104-12-9**] EEG: IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to a very low voltage
theta/delta pattern sustained throughout the recording and
suggestive of a diffuse mild to moderate encephalopathy.

[**2104-12-10**] KUB: FINDINGS: The NG tube tip is seen in the expected
location of the distal stomach. There is no ileus, obstruction,
or massive free air. There are no radiopaque densities to
suggest renal stones. The bones are normal. The lung bases are
not well visualized.
IMPRESSION: NG tube tip in expected location. No ileus or
obstruction.

[**2104-12-12**] CXR: Chest tubes remain in place, without evidence of
large pneumothorax. Left retrocardiac opacity persists, possibly
representing subpulmonic effusion and to a lesser extent
atelectasis. Subcutaneous gas continuing to decrease.

[**2104-12-16**] TTE: The left atrium is dilated. The estimated right
atrial pressure is 0-5 mmHg. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF>55%). There is no left ventricular outflow obstruction at
rest or with Valsalva. Right ventricular chamber size and free
wall motion are normal. The aortic root is moderately dilated at
the sinus level. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis. Mild (1+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. No mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no pericardial effusion.
