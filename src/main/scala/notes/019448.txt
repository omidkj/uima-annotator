CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Left carotid stenosis.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 78 year-old gentleman
who was initially evaluated for carotid stenosis for
potential carotid stenosis for potential carotid stenting but
he was not a candidate for stenting. He would require a left
carotid endarterectomy. The patient is now admitted for a
left carotid endarterectomy. The patient's previous history
is significant for a parietal stroke in [**Month (only) 216**] of this year
from which he fully recovered.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Xanax 1 mg at bedtime, Lasix 40 mg
daily, Coreg 3.125 mg b.i.d., Bilan 80 mg q.d., Coumadin 5 mg
q.d. which had been held for 4 days.

PAST ILLNESSES:  Includes left parietal cerebrovascular
accident in [**2136-8-20**], a history of chronic atrial
fibrillation, anticoagulated. History of coronary artery
disease, status post coronary angioplasty of the right
coronary artery in [**2134**], history of congestive heart failure
compensated in [**2135**]. History of type 2 diabetes. History of
left vocal cord cancer, status post resection in [**2133-8-20**], History of squamous cell carcinoma of the left thorax
and leg, status post excision, history of Factory D Leiden
deficiency. History of hypertension.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is married and lives with his
wife. [**Name (NI) **] admits to 3 drinks per day and is a former tobacco
user. Has not smoked since [**2126**].

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs: Blood pressure 122/59,
heart rate 80, respirations 16, O2 saturation 95% on room
air. General appearance: This is a white male in no acute
distress and oriented x3. Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat
examination was remarkable for left carotid bruit. Heart is
irregular-irregular rhythm with a I/VI systolic ejection
murmur. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Neurological examination is intact.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the
preoperative holding area on [**2136-10-2**]. He underwent
a left carotid endarterectomy without complication and was
transferred to the post anesthesia care unit in stable
condition. Patient developed atrial fibrillation and
bradycardia requiring Neo-Synephrine support. His rule out
was negative. The patient developed on [**2136-10-4**] at
about 3 A.M. in the morning mental status changes associated
with hypoxia with a pCO2 of 80 and CO2 of 67. The chest x-ray
showed possible [**Location (un) 22533**] hump. The patient was begun on IV
heparin. CTA was obtained which showed a left lower lobe
pulmonary embolus. Patient became aphasic with right sided
flaccidness. The heparin was discontinued. CTA of the head
was obtained which showed a large hemorrhagic stroke. He was
given 2 units of fresh frozen plasma and a unit of platelets.
He required Neo-Synephrine and dobutamine for blood pressure
control. Neurosurgery was consulted. The patient was begun on
a Dilantin load and he underwent on [**10-5**] a left
parietal frontal craniotomy with evacuation of hemorrhage.
Intraoperatively the patient experienced asystole but  was
resuscitated. Inferior vena cava filter was placed. Because
of history of atrial fibrillation the patient was admitted to
the thoracic Intensive Care Unit for continued care. The
patient continued on a prednisone taper. He developed
transient thrombocytopenia. His heparin dependent antibodies
were negative. EPS was consulted secondary to the patient's
atrial fibrillation and bradycardia. They felt that a
pacemaker was not indicated at this time although external
pacemaker leads were applied. A nasogastric tube was placed
on [**10-6**] and tube feeds were begun. The patient was
noted to have a left neck hematoma which was stable. A
[**10-7**] a CPAP was tried. The patient failed. The
patient was begun on Zosyn for gram negative rods in his
sputum culture and a right lower lobe infiltrate on chest x-
ray. White count at that time was 7.4. Levofloxacin was added
on [**10-9**] to his Zosyn for broader pseudomonas coverage
in his sputum. On [**10-10**] the patient was finally
extubated. A swallowing study was done at the bedside. The
patient did show signs of aspiration with delayed swallowing.
The study was terminated because of concern for respiratory
compromise and the patient remained n.p.o. on tube feeds. On
[**10-11**] the patient self discontinued his tube feed and
his arterial line. The Dobhoff was replaced. IV
heparinization was started slowly. On [**10-13**] the
patient was transferred to the vascular Intensive Care Unit
for continued monitoring and care. Physical therapy and
occupational therapy evaluations were begun. On [**10-15**]
the patient desaturated to an O2 of 59%. He was transferred
to the Intensive Care Unit. He required IV Lasix and
Lopressor for rate control. And nebulizers and aggressive
pulmonary care. On [**10-16**] patient remained in the
Intensive Care Unit. Stool for C difficile was sent and
patient's stool was positive and patient was started on
[**Month (only) 63237**]. On [**10-17**] a repeat swallow was attempted but
held secondary to the patient being n.p.o. for a PEG
placement.

On [**9-21**] the patient underwent endoscopic percutaneous
gastric tube placement. The patient continued to do well,
tolerated his tube feeds. On [**10-21**] patient was
transferred to the vascular intensive care unit for continued
monitoring and care. On [**2136-10-23**] physical therapy
continued to work with the patient. IV heparin and
Coumadinization conversion was continued. Renal screening was
begun. The patient will be discharged to rehabilitation when
he is in a steady therapeutic INR state of 2 to 3.0. The
patient will follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] as directed post
discharge from rehabilitation. He should follow up with his
primary care physician.
