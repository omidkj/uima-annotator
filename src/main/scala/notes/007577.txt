History of Present Illness:
73 year old male with oxygen-dependent COPD and hypertension
presenting from work with fever, chills and chest heaviness. The
patient is followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and uses 2L of oxygen at
baseline. He was in his usual state of health until this morning
at work, when he developed rigors and felt feverish. He noticed
a central chest heaviness, a cough productive of yellow sputum
(previously dry), shortness of breath and felt overall unwell.
He called EMS and was brought to the ED.

He denied headache, lightheadedness, blurred vision, difficulty
swallowing, left chest pain, radiation of his chest heaviness,
abdominal pain, n/v/d/c. He does endorse urinary urgency
starting last night, but denies hematuria or dysuria.

In the ED, initial vitals were: 103.3 140/81 118 22 90% NRB. He
was unable to tolerate removal of the NRB, with instant
desaturation to low 80s on room air. His oxygen was titrated and
stabilized at 87-90% on 50% venti mask. He was given 2 L IVF
with improvement of his HR to 90s. CXR was without infiltrate
and CTA was negative for PE or infiltrate. He was given 750 mg
Levofloxacin, nebulizers, acetaminophen 1 gram, motrin 600 mg
and 125 mg IV Solumedrol. He is transferred to the ICU for
further management.

Currently, he feels "much better," and has no specific
complaints. The chest heaviness has resolved and his breathing
feels more comfortable. He received the pneumovax and influenza
vaccine.

seen to account for these symptoms.

Cx and resp. viral screen negative.


Brief Hospital Course:
73 year old male with oxygen dependent COPD, OSA and
hypertension presenting with fever and hypoxia.

Fever/hypoxia: Clinically consistent with bacterial vs. viral
infection leading to flare of chronic lung disease. No
infiltrate on CXR.  Rapidly improved with levofloxacin and
steroids/nebs, to baseline.

Urinary symptoms: UA showed mod leukocytes and some WBC, however
without bacteria. Unforunately, no urine culture was sent.
Levofloxacin will likely treat typical organisisms.  Have
advised that pt. f/u with his urologist for ? urodynamics,
prostate eval as this may represent secont UTI for him without
known urogenital pathology.
