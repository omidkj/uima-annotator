Brief Hospital Course:
67 yo M with history of lung cancer and left sided CVA with
right-sided hemiparesis and aphagia discharged last week and
sent to Spauliding now presenting with fever, tachycardia and
shortness of breath.

Patient was initially admitted to the ICU with respiratory
distress.  He has a history of COPD discharged on [**3-18**] for
apparent flare.  Had not been receiving Atrovent at [**Hospital1 **].

# Respiratory Distress. Initially admitted to the ICU.  While in
the ICU, he was continued on Atrovent and Albuterol nebs, as
well as Spiriva.  Treated with Vancomycin and Zosyn for HAP and
started on burst course of steroids for COPD flare.  Respiratory
status stabilized the morning of admission and transferred to
hospital floor.  Cont'd on albuterol, atrovent and switched to
Advair.  Vancomycin stopped, continued on Zosyn via PICC line
placed by IR.  Pred burst planned for taper at rehab.  O2
requirement weaned to 2L at discharge.
.
# Mental Status. On arrival to hospital floor pt was alert and
awake and later became somnolent in the afternoon.  Vital signs
continued to remain normal and cardiac workup, CT head, and lab
tets were negative for cause of AMS changes.  Pt slept well the
first night and was not somnolent aferwards.  Pt noted to be
awake and alert remainder of the hospitalization.
.
# Fever/Elevated WBC. Elevated WBC noted to be decreasing during
the hospitalization, with no fevers noted after starting
antibiotics.  CXR/CT scan suggestive of RLL infiltrate, UA and
UCx positive for UTI.  Pt initially tx'd with Vanc/Zosyn with
d/c on Zosyn.  Afebrile with equivocal WBC count in context of
steroids.
.
# Urinary Tract Infection. UA/UCx positive for staph negative
strep UTI.  Sensitive to penicillins, covered with Zosyn for
concomittant PNA.  Foley changed in ICU.
.
# S/p left MCA stroke/Anticoagulation. Initial INR
subtherapeutic.  Likely related to preious admin of Levoflox and
Coumadin increasing warfarin blood levels in last
hospitalization.  In absence of Levoflox started on 5mg Coumadin
with therapuetic range achieved.
.
# Diabetes Mellitus. Sugars continued to remain in 200s/300s as
prednisone cont'd with increased tube feeds.  Lantus/ ISS
increased to match sugars with reasonable control achieved on
d/c.  Will need to address coverage as prednisone is tapered in
rehab.
.
# Hyperlipidemia. Pt was continued on statin.
.
# CAD s/p MI and angioplasty in [**2145**]. Pt was continued on ASA
and Lopressor with target BPs acheived.  EKGs showed no interval
changes with no rises in CEs noted.
.
# FEN. PEG tube on admission.  Tube feeds brought to goal with
lytes repleted PRN.
