Service:  NEUROSURGERY
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 77-year-old man
who reportedly was observed by his family to have slipped and
fallen backward on the ice when getting out of his car.  He
hit the back of his head and reportedly had three to four
minutes of loss of consciousness.  EMS was called and the
room where he reportedly was initially confused but easily
arousable, opened his eyes and followed commands.  A CT was
done at 11:20 the morning of admission which was positive for
subarachnoid hemorrhage and small bifrontal subdural
collections.  The patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 346**] for further management.  Just prior
to transfer the patient became more somnolent with decreased
intubated and sedated on propofol at 40 mcg per kg per
minute.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1. Noninsulin dependent diabetes
mellitus.  2. Hypertension.  3. Glaucoma.  4. Cataract.  5.
Macular degeneration with decreased vision in the left eye.

MEDICATIONS:  1. Lisinopril 20 mg p.o. q. day.  2. Glyburide
10 mg q. day.  3. Metformin 1 gram b.i.d.  4. Atenolol 50 q.
day.  5. Ditropan 5 mg b.i.d.  6. Enteric-coated aspirin 325
p.o. q. day.  7. Timolol 0.5% and Xalatan 0.005% OU q. day.

The patient's outside CT showed subarachnoid hemorrhage in
the basal cistern extending beneath the bilateral frontal
lobes with small bifrontal inferior pole subdural hematoma.
No midline shift, no blood in the ventricles and no
effacement of the ventricles.  The patient was admitted to
the neurologic intensive care unit.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient's temperature the following day
after admission was 103.7.  He was continued on propofol but
opened his eyes to command and voice, moved all four
extremities with antigravity strength.  Pupils were 2 down to
1 mm on the left and 2.5 down to 2 on the right.  The patient
continued to be monitored closely and had an ICP monitor
placed on the day after admission for ICP monitoring
purposes.  His ICP was 12 after placement of [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]
catheter.

He was seen by the surgical service due to a dropping
hematocrit.  The patient also has a history of thalassemia
with splenomegaly.  He had an abdominal CT which was negative
for a splenic laceration.  The patient also had a chest x-ray
which showed no pneumothorax with line in good placement.

On [**2-4**] the patient had an episode of his heart rate
dropping down to the 40s, question of AV dissociation.  Blood
pressure was down to the 80s.  The patient's Nipride was shut
off.  He had an EKG.  His blood pressure came back up and his
heart rate came back up to the 50s to 70 range.  He was back
in a first degree AV block.

Neurologically the patient was sedated on propofol, although
propofol was shut off q. 1 hour for examinations.  The
patient opened his eyes to voice, spontaneously blinking and
wiggling toes to commands.

The patient had positive Gram-negative rods in his sputum
from the 5th.  He was on levofloxacin for positive sputum
culture.  The patient continued to be intubated.  Pupils were
left 3 down to 2.5, right 3.5 down to 3.  He opened his eyes
to voice, localized in the upper extremities, wiggled toes to
command.

The patient had an MRI of the head and cervical spine.  The
MRI of the cervical spine was negative for ligamentous
injury.  Cervical spine was cleared and the cervical collar
was removed.

The patient continued to be intubated, opening his eyes
spontaneously, following commands with the right hand, and
localizing the upper extremities and wiggling toes to
commands on the lower extremity.

MRI of the brain showed a small left parietal area of
restricted diffusion consistent with an infarct, otherwise
MRI was unchanged.

On [**2182-2-16**] the patient went into atrial fibrillation.
Cardiology was consulted and the patient was cardioverted.
On the 15th his EKG was stable.  His heart rate was 75 and
sinus rhythm although he had problems with prolonged [**Name (NI) **].  He
was started on amiodarone at 400 mg p.o. b.i.d.

He also had difficulty with blood glucoses.  He was on an
insulin drip while in the intensive care unit.

He also had a sputum culture which was positive for E. coli
so currently the patient is receiving levofloxacin and
erythromycin for antibiotic coverage for his sputum.

He also spiked a temperature to 103 on [**2182-2-17**].  He was
fully cultures.  He continued on antibiotics for aspiration
pneumonia and adult respiratory distress syndrome.  His line
was changed over a wire.  Several attempts were made at
trying to extubate and wean the procedure although he failed
and required tracheostomy placement which was done on
[**2182-2-20**] without complications.  Currently he is being weaned
from the ventilator although still requiring some ventilator
support at night and has to intermittently be on a
tracheostomy collar.

Neurologically the patient is awake and attentive, follows
simple commands to move all four extremities.  He is now
trached and PEG'd.  Temperature is 100.1.  His white count is
14, hematocrit 31.1, platelet count 206, sodium 141, K 3.7,
chloride 104, CO2 29, BUN 25, creatinine 0.8, glucose 180 and
he is stable at this point from a neurologic standpoint and
is stable from a respiratory standpoint, currently receiving
fluconazole for antibiotics and vancomycin and Zosyn for his
positive sputum culture with Corynebacterium, 1+
Gram-positive cocci in pairs; also a positive urine culture
for yeast, negative catheter tip; currently receiving
levofloxacin and vancomycin for positive sputum culture.  He
is also methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus positive
from just a screening culture from his naris.

The patient's condition is stable at this time and he is
ready for discharge to rehabilitation.  He will need to
follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1132**] in three to four weeks' time with a
repeat head CT at that time.
