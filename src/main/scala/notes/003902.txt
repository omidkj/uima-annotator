Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 358**]
Chief Complaint:
Hypotension and hypoxia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Central Line Placement [**2118-2-4**] and removal on [**2119-2-7**]

History of Present Illness:
71 F with HTN, dyslipidemia, recent pacer placement for sinus
arrest complicated by recurrent hemorrhagic pericardial
effusions, admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] for episode of hypoxia in the
setting of worsened chest pain and DOE; on [**2-3**] she is
transferred to the ICU for hypotension, new O2 requirement and
confusion.
.
She was reportedly doing well at rehab s/p hemorrhagic
pericardial effusion after PPM placement, until the day prior to
presentation, when she developed worsening chest pain and SOB.
She reported that the pain felt like it was "going around her
heart", was sharp, worse with deep inspiration, and radiated to
the left jaw. She also had SOB, with worsening DOE while walking
at rehab. She otherwise denied n/v, diaphoresis. No lower
extremity pain or swelling. She was found to have an O2 sat of
69% on RA. She was placed on a NRB with improvement in O2 sat to
89%. Sent to ED for evaluation.
.
ED Course: O2 sats >97% on 3L by NC, and SBP remained > 100. She
had a bedside focused echo which showed a "small effusion and no
wall motion abnormalities." Pulsus measurements in the ED
remained < 10 mm Hg. A subsequent formal TTE showed a small to
moderate circumferential pericardial effusion that was echo
dense, consistent with "blood, inflammation or other cellular
elements", without echocardiographic signs of tamponade. Overall
EF 70%. She also received a V/Q scan for an elevated D-dimer
(h/o contrast allergy) which showed multiple large and small
matched defects through out all lobes of the lungs, consistent
with COPD. It also showed an unmatched defect (greater on
perfusion) in the posterior left lower lobe, thought related to
shifting effusion upon position change from ventilation to
perfusion. The study was read as intermediate probability.
.
Hospital Course: patient was admitted to medical service. Today
([**2-3**]) patient had trigger episode with hypotension responsive to
IVF (75/48), new O2 requirement (96% on 2L), mental status
changes - found to be cool and diaphoretic; this prompted her
transfer to the ICU team. ABG at the time was 7.33/43/145.
.
Recent [**Last Name (un) 1724**] Course: Initially presented to [**Hospital3 **] with
syncope and found to have sinus pause with junctional escape of
35. She received PPM on [**1-10**] @ [**Last Name (un) 1724**]. On [**2119-1-13**] (2 days after
discharge for pacer implantation) came back to [**Last Name (un) 1724**] with chest
pain and palpitations and was found to be in atrial fibrillation
with a rapid ventricular response of 190. She was electrically
cardioverted, but remained hypotensive. She was found to have a
pericardial effusion with tamponade. A pericardiocentesis
drained 200 cc of hemorrhagic fluid. However, she had recurrent
effusion later that same day, and ultimately underwent
mediastinotomy, where she was found to have a small bleeding
vessel "at the site of her prior pericardiocentesis." Her atrial
lead could also be seen in the atrium, though it was noted not
to be protruding through, and was oversewn. Also of note, she
was evaluated here for SIADH - found to have normal urine Osm
(656) and low serum Osm (278), urine Na of 81; this resolved
spontanteously. She was discharged to [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 1820**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] at [**Location (un) 78090**] on [**2119-1-23**].

Pertinent Results:
[**2-1**] VQ Scan: INTERPRETATION:
Ventilation images obtained with Tc-[**Age over 90 **]m aerosol in 6 views
demonstrate multiplelarge and small defects through out all
lobes of the lungs, consistent with COPD.
Perfusion images in the same 6 views show matched defects with
the ventilation scan with a somewhat greater sized perfusion
defect seen in the posterior leftlower lobe, likely related to
shifting effusion upon position change fromventilation to
perfusion.
Chest x-ray shows a small left pleural effusion.
The above findings are consistent with an indeterminant
probability scan.
IMPRESSION: Indeterminant probability scan. Severe COPD.

[**2-5**] CXR:Comparison is made with prior study performed a day
earlier.
There has been progressive interval increase in
small-to-moderate right pleural effusion, moderate left pleural
effusion is unchanged as is left lower lobe retrocardiac
atelectasis. Left transvenous pacemaker leads terminate in the
standard position in the right atrium and right ventricle. Right
subclavian catheter tip remains in the proximal right atrium.
The aorta is elongated. Cardiac size is top normal. There is
engorgement of the pulmonary vasculature with no overt CHF.
Patient is post median sternotomy.

[**2119-2-1**] EKG: Sinus rhythm. T wave inversion in leads VI-V2 and T
wave flattening in leads aVL and V3 which is non-specific.
Ischemia should be considered. Clinical correlation is
suggested. No previous tracing available for comparison.

[**2119-2-3**] ECHO: The left ventricular cavity is small. Left
ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve is not well seen. There is a moderate sized
pericardial effusion subtending the apex, right ventricular free
wall, and lateral wall. The effusion is echo dense, consistent
with blood, inflammation or other cellular elements. There are
no echocardiographic signs of tamponade. No right atrial or
right ventricular diastolic collapse is seen.

Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed)
of [**2118-2-2**], the findings are similar.
