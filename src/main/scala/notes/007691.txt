History of Present Illness:
59M history of nonischemic cardiomyopathy (EF 40%), ICD, recent
admission to CCU with ablation of V. tach, discharged 9 days ago
who complains of 15 pound weight gain, worsened dyspnea and
orthopnea since that time. No infectious symptoms. on torsemide
and spironolactone at home. He saw Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]/Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in
the office on [**2206-10-17**] for evaluation, at which time they
increased his torsemide 30mg Qdaily to 50mg Qdaily (he was
discharged on a dose of torsemide 30mg QOD, but had been taking
it daily). This is in addition to his spironolactone. Per
patient, he felt worse over the weekend with fatigue, SOB,
orthopnea. Cr on office visit [**10-17**] was 1.8-->3.7 today.

In the ER, intial VS 96.4 73 95/70 12 94% RA. On exam, lungs
clear, edema up to the abdomen. chest x-ray consistent with some
failure but not significantly changed from prior. BNP improved
from prior (799 from [**2156**] a year ago). Blood pressure 70s
systolic, with its baseline is 80s, mentating well. Blood
pressure did transiently dip down to 69/50, after which he was
given 200cc IVF with response to 78/57. bedside u/s showing

CXR
IMPRESSION:
1. Cardiomegaly, although pericardial effusion cannot be
excluded; consider echocardiogram - discussed with [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] at
9:21 am on [**2206-10-20**] over the phone.
2. Low lung volumes with bibasilar atelectasis.
.
ECHO
[**2206-10-20**]
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
There is a moderate to large circumferential pericardial
effusion with right ventricular diastolic collapse, consistent
with impaired fillling/tamponade physiology.

IMPRESSION: Moderate to large circumferential pericardial
effusion with echo evidence of increased pericardial
pressure/tamponade physiology.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2206-10-11**], the
pericardial effusion and tamponade findings are new.
.
[**2206-10-20**] - echo
Initial images at 10:16am demonstrate right ventricular cavity
dilation with a small (>1cm) anterior pericardial effusion. The
effusion is much smaller than the echo earlier in the day and
the right ventricular cavity is much larger.

10:29am images demonstrate a similar small anterior pericardial
effusion.

10:44am images demonstrate akinesis of the heart without very
small anterior pericardial effusion. The right ventricular
remains dilated.

Brief Hospital Course:
59M history of nonischemic cardiomyopathy (EF 40%), ICD, recent
admission to CCU with ablation of V. tach, discharged 9 days ago
who complains of 15 pound weight gain, worsened dyspnea and
orthopnea since that time.  In the [**Name (NI) **], pt was found to be
hypotensive and in right sided heart failure.  A bedside echo at
6:00 am was performed that showed pericardial effusion, pt was
given IVF given preload dependent state.  Cardiology was
consulted and repeat echo performed at 7:14, and pt was brought
to the cath lab for drainage of effusion.  INR was elevated, so
ffp was ordered to reduce chance of bleeding during procedure.
.
In holding area, pt was in respiratory distress and hypotensive
to 80's systolic, with levophed infusion.  Pt was urgently
prepped and drapped, could not lie flat b/c respiratory
distress.  Pericardiocentesis was performed with subxyphoid
approach and 400cc bloody fluid was aspirated, blood pressure
improved to 120's systolic and levophed was reduced.
Echocardiographic confirmation of catheter position was diffult
to determine and pt grew hypotensive and apneic.  CPR was
started and pt was rapidly intubated.  Pericardial catheter was
removed post cutdown to xyphoid and needle accessed pericardial
space and an additional 120cc of fluid was removed.  Echo
confirmed effusion had resolved, but at this point pt was in PEA
arrest.  C-[**Doctor First Name **] was present and determined that ECMO futile.  Pt
expired at 10:27AM. Medical Examinerwas notified to request
autopsy and case was declined by Dr.
[**First Name (STitle) **] at 11:15 AM.  Family was notified of patient's passing by
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
