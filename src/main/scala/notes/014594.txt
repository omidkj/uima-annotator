.
Head CT [**5-29**]: Left subdural hematoma involving the entire left
convexity and left middle cranial fossa, with subfalcine
herniation to the right of [**2-2**] mm. Apparent effacement of the
left suprasellar cistern may be due to oblique patient
positioning but is concerning for early uncal herniation.
.
B/L LENIs [**5-29**]: neg
PCXR [**5-29**]: Clear lungs. No rib fractures.
EKG: Normal sinus rhythm. Occasional PACs.
CT C-spine [**5-30**]: Severe degenerative changes of the cervical
spine. Loss of the normal cervical lordosis. Anterolisthesis of
C4 on C5 is likely secondary to degenerative changes
.
EEG [**6-1**]: This is an abnormal portable EEG due to the presence of

bursts of sharp slowing and delta frequency slowing over the
entire left
hemisphere and increased voltage gradient over the left
hemisphere
throughout the recording. Additionally, the background over the
right
hemisphere is mildly slow and disorganized. The first
abnormality
suggests subcortical and possible cortical dysfunction diffusely

affecting the left hemisphere, predominantly over the left
fronto-central region. The second abnormality suggests a
widespread
mild encephalopathy with subcortical and cortical dysfunction.
There
were no clear epileptiform discharges recorded.
.
MRI [**6-2**]: No acute infarcts. Stable small left subdural hematoma
and pneumocephalus after recent subdural hematoma evacuation.
Small vessel ischemic changes.
.
Carotids [**6-2**]: No evidence of hemodynamically significant
stenosis in the carotid arteries bilaterally. Nonvisualization
of the left vertebral artery.
.
KUB [**6-4**]: 1. Marked dilatation of large bowel with the cecum
measuring 12 cm. This may represent colonic ileus, although, a
low rectal obstruction cannot be excluded. Continued interval
followup is recommended.
.
ECHO [**6-4**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial septal
defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Right ventricular chamber
size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic root is mildly
dilated. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic arch
is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Mild (1+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild to moderate
([**12-2**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is mild pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
.
CTA [**6-5**]: 1. Multiple small subsegmental pulmonary emboli within
the right upper and right lower lobes.
2. Right lower lobe pulmonary nodules are unchanged from the
PET/CT of [**2109-9-18**].
.
Head CT [**6-6**]: No change since the prior examination in the size
of the small left subdural collection, status post evacuation of
a subdural hematoma. No midline shift. No new hemorrhage.
.
KUB [**6-6**]: Nonspecific bowel gas pattern with nondilated loops of
air-filled small and large bowel.
.
Head CT [**6-9**]: Stable appearance of a small left subdural
collection status post evacuation of a subdural hematoma. No
midline shift or evidence of new hemorrhage


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr [**Known lastname **] was admitted to the NeuroICU for Q1 Neurochecks, he
was prepared for surgery on HD#2. Due to his significant
pronator drift and cofounding MS which could impaired his exam
he was consented for a left sided craniotomy for subdural
evacuation. Post operatively he was awake, alert and orientated
X3 with right sided weakness, his dressing was dry and intact. A
head CT postoperatively showed subdural removed with air in the
space. On POD#1 he was found to have right sided weakness and a
repeat head CT showed some reaccumulation of blood in the
subdural space he was transferred to the neurological floor.
.
On POD#2 he was found to have garbled speech and significant
right sided hemi-paresis, he was brought for an emergent head CT
which showed stable amount of blood. He was transferred to the
Neurostep down unit for closer neurological exam. An MRI done
was of poor quality but did not show stroke. An EKG showed
normal sinus rhythm. A chest Xray was done and showed right
infrahilar mass that on a followup CT was shown to be
insignificant stable findings from previous studies. An EEG was
done and showed no epileptiform focus. His vital signs remained
stable. On POD#3 the neuro exam improved in the morning to
a&ox3, but again fluctuated to disoriented and aphasic aphasic
