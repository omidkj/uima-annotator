Intubation

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 25661**] is a 39 year old woman with a history of morbid
obesity, obstructive sleep apnea, and COPD on home O2 that
presented to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED complaining of shortness of breath for
about 1 week and a productive cough. Her vital signs were
initially T 102 HR 116 BP 112/palp and 96% on O2 (route/quantity
unknown) and 76% RA and she could only speak in short phrases.
Initial ABG was 7.34/71/58.
She was started on bipap, and given
azithro/ceftriaxone/solumedrol. Her BP dropped and responded to
IV fluids. She ultimately received 5L NS. A foley was placed at
10:30pm and 380cc returned.

Pertinent Results:
EKG: Sinus tach 148bpm, normal axis, no st/t changes.
.
Imaging:
CXR 7:30pm: Tip of the newly placed endotracheal tube is at the
level of the sternal notch between 3 and 4 cm from the carina.
Nasogastric tube can be traced as far as the mid esophagus, but
largely because of technical limitations in imaging in a patient
of this size I cannot be sure it passes any further. Severe
cardiomegaly is longstanding finding. There may be a
moderate-sized right pleural effusion layering posteriorly, but
there is also a suggestion of worsening consolidation in the
right lung and vascular congestion on the left. All in all
findings suggest pneumonia and acute decompensation of chronic
cardiac insufficiency. Findings were discussed by telephone with
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] at the time of dictation.
.
Swallow study [**4-5**]:  No aspiration on bedside swallow study,
with functional swallow for thin liquids and regular consistency
solids.  Recommend:  Begin PO diet of thin liquids and regular
consistency solids.  Give pills whole with thin liquids.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 39F with supermorbid obesity, COPD on home o2, presented
with worsening shortness of breath, fevers, tachycardia,
intubated for respiratory failure.
.
# Respiratory failure: Pt was intubated for hypercarbia/hypoxia
and oxygenated and ventilated well on AC.  Pt was continued on
CTX and azithro (both started [**3-28**]) but discontinued azithro
after 4 days due to elevated INR thought to be interaction
between azithro and coumadin.  The patient was continued on MDI
as well.  Plan to continue CTX and wean vent.  The patient was
extubated on [**4-3**], but developed respiratory distress with
hypoxia and tachycardia soon after the tube was pulled.  She was
placed on non-invasive ventilation, and it was thought that she
may need to be reintubated.  The patient refused, however, and
this decision was discussed with her mother and sister (her code
status, however, is full, confirmed on day of discharge).  An
A-line was place for closer ABG monitoring, and the patient was
able to be maintained on non-invasive ventilation.  She was
eventually transitioned to a 50% face mask.  She was provided
with her home C-PAP settings overnight, and her home machine was
brought in prior to transfer to the floor.  She completed a
total of ten days of Ceftriaxone for CAP.  On day of discharge
she has been saturating 94% on 4L O2 consistently for the few
days prior to discharge.  She desaturates with transfers and
should therefore have increased oxygen with activity.  She is on
2L oxygen at home.  She also uses nebulizers as needed at home.
She was kept on standing NEBs Q6 hours here, but will be
transitioned back to her Advair and fluticasone inhalers at
rehab, with NEBs PRN.
.
# History of DVT/?PE: On chronic lifelong anticoagulation.  Pt
was initially continued on lower dose coumadin, but due to
elevating INR (5), coumadin and azithromycin was discontinued.
Despite discontinuation of azithro and coumdin, INR continued to
rise on [**4-1**] (to [**8-16**]), so pt received FFP and vit K as central
line placement was also intended to occur.  Her heparin drip was
restarted once her INR was below 2, and she was maintained on
the drip until Coumadin could be restarted.  Once she passed a
speech and swallow eval, her Coumadin was restarted at 5mg qhs
and increased to 6 mg po qhs.  The pt will remain on heparin gtt
for 48 hrs after INR is [**2-10**].
.
# Hypertension- The patient was started on IV lopressor for
persistent hypertension, and this effectively lowered her blood
pressure.  She was changed over to oral Lopressor once her
speech and swallow eval was completed.  Given that she did not
have a prior diagnosis of hypertension, her blood pressure may
normalize once her breathing has stabilized and her infection
has cleared.
.
# F/E/N: NPO initially and started tubefeeds via OG.  The tube
feeds were then held in anticipation of extubation, and
following extubation, the patient underwent a speech and swallow
evaluation which she successfully passed.  She was placed on a
regular, low sodium diet with thin liquids, however can resume
regular liquids at rehab.
.
# Code: Full, addressed with patient on discharge.
