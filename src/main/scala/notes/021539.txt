Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1505**]
Chief Complaint:
transfer from OSH for severe MR / SOB

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac Catheterization [**2110-3-13**]
[**2110-3-17**] MV repair ( 26mm [**Company 1543**] 3D Profile ring)/ cabg x1 (
SVG to RCA)

History of Present Illness:
76 yo F with h/o COPD, PVD and HTN presented to OSH on [**3-10**] with
SOB, thought to be PNA vs. COPD exac. Pt reports being in her
usual state of health (active, without O2 requirement or
dyspnea) until developing acute onset shortness of breath
worsening over several minutes after walking her dog on [**3-10**]. She
describes difficulty catching her breath and diaphoresis,
without any associated pain, nausea. Based on initial workup was
thought to be due to pneumonia, COPD exacerbation and CHF and
thus was treated with abx, steroids, diuresis. Was then noted to
have severe MR murmur, with associated elevated BNP (663). ECHO
revealed 4+ MR and could not rule out flail leaflet. She had EF
75% without WMA. ECG and CE also without evidence of ischemia.

Hospital course also significant for lack of fever, but
leukocytosis to 24 in setting of steroids. Creatinine also
increased to 1.6 on diuresis.

Vital Signs on transfer: afebrile, 104/43, 80 SR, 20, 95% on
2liters

On review of systems completely negative other than mentioned in
HPI including history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis,
pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias,
joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools. She
denies recent fevers, chills or rigors, exertional buttock or
calf pain.

Conclusions
Prebypass

No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Regional
left ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). [Intrinsic left
ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the
severity of valvular regurgitation.] Right ventricular chamber
size and free wall motion are normal. There are simple atheroma
in the descending thoracic aorta. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is
partial mitral leaflet flail. An eccentric, anteriorly directed
jet of Severe (4+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Severe [4+]
tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in person of the results on [**2110-3-17**]
at 1430.

Post Bypass

Patient is AV paced and receiving an infusion of phenylephrine,
epinephrine and milrinone.

LVEF is globally reduced to 35%

Annuloplasty ring seen in the mitral position. Appears well
seated and there is mild mitral regurgitation. Mean gradient
across the mitral valve is 4 mm Hg. There is no systolic
anterior motion.

Aorta appears intact post decannulation. Mild aortic
insufficiency persists.

The tricuspid regurgitation is now mild to moderate

Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **] aware of post bypass findings.
  I certify that I was present for this procedure in compliance
with HCFA regulations.

Brief Hospital Course:
# SOB: This was thought likely due to severe acute MR leading to
pulmonary edema. Had been getting moxifloxacin at OSH but post
diuresis CXR showed no evidence of infection. CXR showed no
infiltrate. Antibiotics were discontinued. Steroids were
discontinued as well. Patient remained afebrile and euvolemic
prior to surgery.

# Mitral Regurgitation: Possible etiologies include 1. ischemia
although never had CP has significant RFs inc. HTN, HL, family
history, and with RCA at 70-80% stenosis could have infarcted
posterior leaflet 2. Infection but denies recent sick symptoms
inc. fevers and no signs endocarditis on exam, 3. Trauma but
patient denies history of trauma. CT surgery was consulted and
recommended MVr vs MVR. Patient had pre-op carotid studies
showing 40-59% stenosis bilaterally as well as chest CT and CXR
that showed a pulmonary nodule that will need to be follow up as
an outpatient in a few months.

# CAD: No h/o CAD, no h/o CP per patient. Had cardiac cath (via
radial artery as has bilateral LE bypasses) to assess severity
of valve disease and CAD for potential bypass in conjunction
with MVR if necessary. cath with mild LCX and LAD disease and
tight RCA disease not intervened upon.  Has RCA with significant
stenosis by numbers (no pressure or IVUS done). Plan to have 1
vessel CABG during MV surgery. Continued asa, statin.

After cath done, pre-op workup completed. Underwent surgery with
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on [**3-17**]. Transferred to the CVICU in stable
condition on epinephrine, milrinone, and propofol
drips.Extubated the next day but developed acute renal
failure.Had rapid A Fib and was treated with amidoarone drip and
subsequent oral dosing. EP was consulted for management.
Creatinine continued to decline and she was transferred to the
floor on POD #5 to begin increasing her activity level. Coumadin
was started for A Fib. ACE-I added for tighter BP control. EF
noted to be approx 35% post-CPB in OR.
Chest tubes and pacing wires removed per protocol. Cleared for
discharge to rehab on POD #9. Target INR is 2.0-2.5 for A Fib.
