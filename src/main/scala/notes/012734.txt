Chief Complaint:
PICC placement

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Guided aspiration of abdominal abscess by interventional
radiology.
Removal of three abdominal JP drains by interventional
radiology.


History of Present Illness:
This is a 25 yo female who has a complicated course post ERCP
pancreatitis who now is admitted for pulmonary embolism.  She
orginally had a cholecystectomy for abd pain, but she retained a
stone which required an ERCP for removed.  This was complicated
by post-ERCP pancreatitis for which she was aggressively
hydrated and developed respiratory failure.  A mediastinal mass
was discovered and she had a biospy done.  She developed a
pneumonthorax from the procedure.  She also underwent an
exploratory laparotomy and developed abdominal abscesses as a
result.
.
She was at rehab in [**Hospital1 **] on a course of Zosyn and JP drains
to treat her abdominal abscess.  She came to [**Hospital1 18**] to replace
her PICC line, but at IR, she was discovered to have bilateral
upper extremity DVTs and left lobar artery pulmonary embolism.
She was admitted to the MICU briefly to start heparin and to
monitor her complicated course, and then transferred to the
medical floors for further management.

PICC PLACEMENT & VENOGRAM:
Successful placement of a 21-cm 5 French double-lumen PICC by
way
of the right brachial vein with the tip in the right axillary
vein.
Bilateral venograms demonstrating occlusion at the level of the
subclavian/axillary junction, with multiple collaterals.
.
CT CHEST W CONTRAST:
1.  Pulmonary emboli involving the branch point of the left
lower lobe pulmonary artery branching into segmental arteries,
extending into subsegmental branches.
2.  Small-to-moderate left pleural effusion.
3.  Fatty liver.
.
CT ABDOMEN & PELVIS:
Drainage catheters unchanged in position.   Presacral fluid
collection is mildly enlarged. Otherwise, multiple abdominal and
pelvic fluid collections are unchanged in size and appearance.
.
FOLLOW UP CT ABD AND PELVIS [**2140-10-11**]:
IMPRESSION: Three drainage catheters remain well positioned
within multiloculated abdominal/pelvic fluid collections, which
are all slightly smaller by several millimeters in each
dimension. Presacral collection also slightly smaller, and is
likely interconnected to pockets containing catheters. The only
collection which is slightly larger is located in the space of
Retzius, but it also appears to be interconnected with the other
pockets.


Brief Hospital Course:
25 yo female with post ERCP pancreatitis complicated by
abdominal abscess admitted for bilateral upper extremity DVTs
and PE.

.
# DVT and PE - likely secondary to immobilization or multiple
PICC's.  She was started on heparin and then transitioned to
lovenox.  She stayed on lovenox during her hospital course
because it would be easier to stop if she were to have any
procedures regarding her abdominal abscess and JP drains.  On
discharge, she will continue loveonox for 3 more weeks until her
flouroquinalone/bactrim course is completed, in case she needs
more procedures, and then she should be switched to coumadin
after 3 weeks.
.
# ABDOMINAL FLUID COLLECTION - Patient came into hospital with 3
abdominal JP drains and course of Zosyn.  She had constant low
grade fevers throughout her hospital course likely from the
abdominal abscess.  A CT scan of the abdominal on [**2140-10-11**]
revealed communicating abscesses that were a few millimeters
smaller in size compared to admission abdominal CT scan on
[**2140-10-3**].  Cultures from all 3 JP drains grew out
stenotrophamonas sensitive to Bactrim.  Infectious disease was
consulted and the thought was that this could be a contaminant.
Interventional radiology got a sample from her abscess by
aspiration and that culture also grew stenotrophomonas.  Surgery
was consulted, and the thought was that there is no need for
surgical intervention at this time.  Her abscesses would be
treated conservatively.  Her JP drains were pulled by IR to
optimize the efficacy of Bactrim because stenotrophamonas
quickly becomes resistent and the JP drains are colonized.
Zosyn was discontinued and bactrim and ciprofloxacin were
started per ID recs on [**2140-10-18**].  Pt would continue on
bactrim/flouroquinolone for three weeeks, and follow up with Dr.
[**First Name (STitle) **] from infectious disease and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] from surgery
in four weeks-- already scheduled.
.
# C-DIFF -  patient was Cdiff positive presumably from her
anitbiotics course.  Per ID recommendations, she would be on
flagyl for 2 weeks after the Zosyn was stopped.  Her last dose
would be on [**2140-10-20**].
.
# NAUSEA AND VOMIT - she had intermitted nausea and vomit of
unclear etiology.  There was no abdominal pain or change in
diarrhea.  Possible explanation include irritation from the
abdominal abscess or antibiotics.
.
# EDEMA - she had dramatic edema from fluids that was given to
her from her last hospital course for pancreatitis.  She was on
lasix and her edema improved on the lower extremities.  However,
she continues to have edema in her upper thighs and abdominal.
Physical activity was encouraged, and PT worked with her with
improvement.
.
# BED SORE ULCERS PPX - she has a superficial ulcer on her right
heel from immobilization.  She used lamb skin boots to protect
heel and ambulation was encouraged.
.
# FEN - she was on a regular diet and per nutrition
recommendations, she had juice-based supplements.  She was on a
daily multivitamin.
