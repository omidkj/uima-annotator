Service: NEUROSURGERY

Allergies:
Ampicillin / Gentamicin

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1854**]
Chief Complaint:
Transfer from TICU s/p craniotomy for SDH, also with suspected
aortic abcess

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Status-post right craniotomy for evacuation of subdural hematoma


History of Present Illness:
70M with PMH of Hep C, HTN, HL, aortic and tricuspid valve
endocarditis s/p AVR and TVR on [**2178-12-17**] with a week of
progressive weakness, fatigue and headache. Recently admitted
[**9-24**] with persistent endocarditis, he has not felt well since
that admission. TTE on [**11-26**] showed recurrent aortic root
abscess. He had an MRI performed on the morning of [**11-27**] that
showed a R sided acute on subacute SDH. He had a head CT/CTA
which showed no vascular malformation and he was brought to the
OR for emergent craniotomy and evacuation. He had 2 packs of
platelets intra-operatively as he was on daily ASA. Initial plan
was for TEE, however AMS and weakness likely [**1-18**] SDH and Dx of
aortic root abscess confirmed by TTE.

70M with PMH of Hep C, HTN, HL, aortic and tricuspid valve
endocarditis s/p AVR and TVR on [**2178-12-17**] with a week of
progressive weakness, fatigue and headache. Recently admitted
[**9-24**] with persistent endocarditis. Saw Dr[**Doctor Last Name **] today who
wrote: "Today in clinic, [**Known firstname 5279**] feels "terrible" - no energy,
dizzy, headache, felt very cold yesterday (despite temp in his
apartment being 79). He has not felt well since admission in
[**Month (only) 359**]. Given these symptoms and his history of recurrent
endocarditis, will check blood cultures, CBC, chem 7 and get him
into hospital. Probable TEE in am."
.
The patient denies fevers, chills or nightsweats and no CP. He
also denies paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle
edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope. he does endorse
worsening headache x 4 days. Of note, he underwent
EGD/Colonoscopy done for reflux and screening, respectively on
[**11-22**]. Findings were only significant for diverticulosis of the
sigmoid colon. He felt worse after this and the next day the
headache began.
.
Of note, his Abiotrophia endocarditis occurred about a year ago
and then again in [**Month (only) 359**], and he does have a porcine valve at
this time. He was about to complete a six-week course of
ampicillin and gentamicin in [**Month (only) **] when he noted diffuse
pruritus. He saw ID, who advised him to stop the Amp/Gent and
wrote: "So, therefore, we will try to do vancomycin for three
days. We will start at a gram every 24 hours given his renal
insufficiency, and this is a dose that he had used in the past.
After stopping the vancomycin, we will switch him to
moxifloxacin 400 mg daily for suppression, and we will need to
determine the duration of this at a later date." Echo done
(prelim) showed: Aortic root abscess with moderate aortic
regurgitation, bioprosthetic aortic valve replacement with
likely vegetation although not well seen and higher than
expected transvalvular gradient. Tricuspid valve replacement
well seated with normal gradients. Low-normal left ventricular
ejection fraction (EF 50-55%). WBC 7.6, afebrile in clinic
today.
.
On review of systems, s/he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. S/he denies recent fevers, chills or
rigors. He denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the
other review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,
ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

Pertinent Results:
EKG: sinus at 63, mildly irregular but no apparant PACs or PVCs,
no ST elevations. ST depression III, QtC 413. Unchanged from
[**10-15**]

2D-ECHOCARDIOGRAM: [**11-26**]
- Left atrium mildly dilated, mild LVH with normal cavity size
and global systolic function (LVEF>55%). Ascending aorta is
moderately dilated. Aortic arch is mildly dilated.
- A bioprosthetic aortic valve with mild (1+) paravalvular
aortic valve leak is present, through a relatively echolucent
area at the aortic annulus, adjacent to the right sinus of
Valsalva. The bioprosthesis itself is seated normally, without
evidence of dehiscence.
- A bioprosthetic tricuspid valve well seated, with normal
leaflet motion and transvalvular gradients. The severity of
tricuspid regurgitation seen is normal for this prosthesis.
- Estimated pulm artery systolic pressure is normal; borderline
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.

MRI Head: [**11-27**]
Right sided subacute subdural hematoma which extends from
frontal
to occipital region is new since previous CT of [**2179-10-16**]. The
SDH is 15-mm in width with a midline shift.

CTA Head: [**11-27**]
- Right-sided subdural hematoma with mass effect and midline
shift.
- Except for vascular displacement due to mass effect from the
hematoma, no abnormalities are seen on CT angiography of the
head. No abnormal vascular structures or aneurysm identified.

CT Head: [**11-27**]
- Interval right craniotomy with expected post-surgical change
with
decreased mass effect. No evidence of new acute intracranial
hemorrhage or major vascular territory infarction.
