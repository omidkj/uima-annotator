Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1145**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest pain and dizziness

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac Catheterization

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 23**] is a [**Age over 90 **]-year-old woman with a pmhx. significant for
coronary artery disease, PMR on prednisone, COPD, asthma, and
hypercholesterolemia who is admitted to the CCU in the setting
of acute ST-segment elevation MI.  Patient saw her PCP urgently
this AM for episodes of dizziness.  During visit, Ms. [**Known lastname 23**]
complained of new onset chest pain, radiating to the back and
akin to an "upset stomach."  Patient also had episode of
bradycardia while ambulating around the office.  An EKG was
performed, which showed ST elevations in I, aVL, V2, V3, V4, V5,
and V6.  Patient was emergently tranferred to the ED and from
there, to the cath lab.  Catherization showed an occluded LAD,
which was difficult to engage; the vessel was perforated (though
contained) during the procedure, and there was no intervention.
Patient received Bivalarudin in cath lab.

ECHO performed emergenty in cath lab was negative for tamponade.
 Patient was transferred to CCU for further monitoring and
medical management of ACS.  Upon arrival to CCU, inital vitals
were: T 95.5, HR 85, BP 118/53, RR 15, SP02 99% on 2LPM.
Patient remained hemodynmaically stable and was started on ASA
81mg, Plavix, and BB.
.
Review of systems is positive for dizziness and subsequent fall
about 1.5 weeks ago.  Patient sustained injuries to her left leg
at that time and was started on antibiotics.  Aside from this
morning, patient denies additional episodes of chest pain,
nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, fevers, chills, PND, orthopnea,
palpitations, syncope, or other concerning signs or symptoms.

Physical Exam:
Physical Exam: [**2157-10-11**]
GENERAL: Elderly woman sitting in chair, no acute distress
HEENT: Somewhat dry mucous membranes
NECK: Supple with normal JVP
CARDIAC: PMI located in 5th intercostal space, midclavicular
line. RR, normal S1, S2. No murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
LUNGS: Mild kyphosis, clear to auscultation bilaterally
ABDOMEN: Soft, NTND, protuberant. No HSM or tenderness. No
abdominial bruits.
EXTREMITIES:  Warm, well-perfused. Dark hematoma over left
patella, healed open areas on left shin. Severe ecchymosis over
bilat legs left> right. No open areas or evidence of cellulitis.


Pertinent Results:
STUDIES:
[**10-5**] Catheterization:
COMMENTS:
1.Selective coronary angiography in this right dominant system
demonstrated one vessel coronary artery disease.  The LMCA had
no
angiographically apparent disease.  The LAD was totally occluded
after
the first diagonal branch.  There were left to left collaterals
filling
the distal LAD.  The LCX and RCA both had minimal disease.
2. Limited resting hemodynamics revealed nomotension.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. One vessel coronary artery disease.

[**10-6**] ECHO:
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. There is moderate regional left
ventricular systolic dysfunction with near akinesis of the
distal one-third of the left ventricle. There is an anteroapical
left ventricular aneurysm. The function of the basal segments is
vigorous and as a result there is a resting left ventricular
outflow tract obstruction. The right ventricular cavity is
mildly dilated with borderline normal free wall function. The
aortic valve is not well seen. Trace aortic regurgitation is
seen. There is a small to moderate sized pericardial effusion.
No right atrial or right ventricular diastolic collapse is seen.


IMPRESSION: Mid-LAD infarction with hyperdynamic basal function
causing an LVOT gradient. No pericardial effusion or evidence of
tamponade.

CXR [**10-8**]:
FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no
relevant
change. Moderate cardiomegaly, minimal pleural effusions, mild
retrocardiac
atelectasis. Minimal signs suggesting overhydration. No newly
appeared focal
parenchymal opacities.


Brief Hospital Course:
This is a [**Age over 90 **]-year-old woman with a history of CAD (by history),
COPD, and PMR who is transferred to CCU from cath lab in setting
of ST elevation MI.
.
# STEMI:  The patient presented in his PCP's office with ST
elevations anteriorly and laterally.  Catheterization showed
complete occlusion of LAD after diag branch, and attempted
percutaneosu intervention was unsuccessful.  based on ECG
appearance we suspected this may have been an older occlusioin
with more recent occlusion proximal to first diagonal that was
no recanalized. Decision was made to optimize patient medically
for CAD. She had some shortness of breath after Cath which
required NC O2 but she was weaned and on discharge she was
breathing comfortably on room air.
.
# CONTAINED LAD PERFORATION:  During cardiac cath, LAD was
perforated, though contained within lumen.  ECHO performed
immediately afterward showed no evidence of effusion.
.
# CHF: Patient with LVEF of 30-35% with hyperkinesis of the
basal left ventricular segments and evidence of left ventricular
outflow tract obstruction ([**Male First Name (un) **]). On repeat ECHO there was
akinesis of the distal third of the ventricle and an apical
aneurysm. Patient was bridged from heparin to coumadin with
planned course 3-6 months.
.
# ATRIAL FIBRILLATION: Developed Afib with RVR on two episodes
during admission. She was rate controlled with Metoprolol and
Diltiazem. Long-term anti-coagulation was discussed and pt was
sent home on coumadin. However, decision was made not to
continue plavix given increased risk of GI bleed.
.
#  LOWER EXTREMITY INFECTION:  Patient presented to ED on [**9-27**]
with lower extemity cellulitis in the setting of a fall.  She
was started on clindamycin, which was switched by PCP to
[**Name9 (PRE) 1378**].  As per patient, she has completed antibiotic course
prior to admission.  No fever, mild white count, asymptomatic.
.
#  GERD:  Continued ranitidine
.
#  COPD/ASTHMA:  Continued Spiriva, albuterol and atrovent
.
#  POLYMYALGIA RHEUMATICA: Continued prednisone 5mg QD
.
#  HYPOTHYROIDISM:  Continued levothyroxine 75mg QD
