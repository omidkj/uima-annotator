Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 689**]
Chief Complaint:
atrial fibrillation

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac catheterization
Colonoscopy


History of Present Illness:
56M w/ multiple medical problems including CAD s/p multiple PCI,
CHF with EF 45%, PAF, DM Type I, ESRD on HD s/p [**First Name3 (LF) **] transplant
x2 who presented to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2182-7-16**] after several episodes of
atrial fibrillation and hypotension during HD and is now
transferred to medicine for GI bleed.
.
He was originally admitted to [**Hospital3 3765**] on [**2182-7-13**] with
complaints of R knee pain after a fall to his right side.  He
was seen by Rheumatology and there was a concern for possible
gout or pseudogout.  During that admission, he underwent HD per
his normal schedule and during HD on [**7-15**] he went into a fib
with a ventricular rate of 130-140. He had severe chest pain
across his entire chest w/ radiation to his shoulders, jaw, and
back. He also noted SOB and a need to move his bowels during
this episode. He was given IV amiodarone during this episode but
remained in a fib for several hours before spontaneously
converting to sinus rhythm.  He was hypotensive to the 80's with
elevated JVP and was given IVF and stress-dose steroids for
possible adrenal insufficiency.  An echocardiogram revealed EF
55% with possible inferior HK.  His cardiac enzymes were checked
and were normal.
.
On the day of transfer on [**7-16**], during HD he again had an
episode of a fib associated with the same chest discomfort and
hypotension. He received 200mg of amiodarone, 2.5mg iv lopressor
x2, dilaudid, and ativan for this episode but remained in a fib
up until the time of transfer to [**Hospital1 18**]. He was also briefly
hypotensive to the 80s and started on neosynephrine in the ICU
there.  On transfer, the pt reported dull chest pain that was
pleuritic. He denied other symptoms.
.
On admission to [**Hospital1 18**] CCU, the patient stated that he had been
on 200mg of amiodarone since last [**Month (only) 205**] when his colostomy was
reversed. He had mild chest pain during HD for the past few
weeks but the episodes during his previous hospitalization had
been much more severe. There were no recent changes in his
dialysis treatment. He had a mild non-productive cough over the
week prior to admission but denied fever, diarrhea,
constipation, nausea, decreased PO intake, or HA. He has had
chronic abdominal pain for the past year. His knee pain began
about 2 weeks ago and had responded well to NSAIDs. He stopped
his NSAIDs because he was told that they can cause GI bleeds if
taken for too long.

Pertinent Results:
IMAGING:
Cath ([**2182-7-17**]): The left anterior descending coronary artery
has mild diffuse disease in the proximal, mid, and distal
portions.  The ramus is a branching vessel that has a 70-80%
stenosis at the upper pole. The left circumflex artery is the
dominant vessel and is patent in the proximal portion. There is
60% in-stent restenosis in the mid-circumflex artery and the
distal circumflex has diffuse disease. OM1 and OM2 are small
vessels.  OM3 has a 100% occlusion that is likely chronic. The
right coronary artery is non-dominant and has a 70% proximal
occlusion, the mid and distal vessel is without significant flow
limiting disease. Left heart catheterization revealed normal
diastolic filling pressures.
.
Echo ([**2182-7-17**]): Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
preserved global and regional biventricular systolic function.
Elevated LVEDP. Pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. Mild
mitral regurgitation.
.
Femoral Vascular US ([**2182-7-18**]): No evidence of arteriovenous
fistula or pseudoaneurysm.
.
KUB ([**2182-7-19**]): Limited study. Mild ascites.No  acute pathology
is demonstrated.
.
Abd CT ([**2182-7-20**]): Liver heterogenous attenuation throughout with
two discrete foci of increased attenuation.  One anteriorly in
segment 8, the other more posteriorly in segment 6 and
laterally. Splenomegaly and the spleen measures nearly 16 cm in
craniocaudad direction.  In addition, peripherally there is a
wedge-shaped area of hypoattenuation. This likely reflects the
vascular phase of enhancement, but would also be consistent with
a splenic infarct. Both native kidneys are markedly shrunken and
atrophic. There is evidence of marked osteopenia.  In addition,
multilevel fractures are identified, including the pelvic bones,
left iliac bone and left femur.

Brief Hospital Course:
1. Atrial fibrillation:  The patient was transferred to the CCU
from the OSH with a recent history of atrial fibrillation and
hypotension complicating his hemodialysis treatments.  This was
considered potentially related to his coronary artery disease
and ischemia.  On hospital day 2, he underwent cardiac
catheterization, which revealed disease in LCx and OM3. The plan
was for medical management, without intervention. The pt was
then evaluated by EP for possible ablation. EP recommended
increasing amiodarone and not doing ablation at this time. His
amiodarone and beta blocker doses were titrated and he remained
in normal sinus rhythm throughout the remainder of his
hospitalization, with the exception of one episode of atrial
fibrillation during dialysis.
.
2. CAD: As noted previously, the patient underwent cardiac
catheterization on transfer from the OSH. The left main was
calcified and widely patent.  The left anterior descending
coronary artery had mild diffuse disease in the proximal, mid,
and distal portions.  The ramus had 70-80% stenosis at the upper
pole and the left circumflex artery was patent in the proximal
portion with a 60% in-stent restenosis in the mid-circumflex and
diffuse disease in the distal circumflex. OM3 had a 100%
occlusion that is likel
