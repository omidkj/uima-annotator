Admission Date:  [**2167-11-20**]       Discharge Date:  [**2167-11-30**]

Service:  CARDIOTHORACIC SURGERY

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:   This is a 76-year-old man who
has about a three to four year history of palpitations and
paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia.  Since being placed
on cardiac medications, the frequency of these episodes has
decreased significantly.  The last episode was six to seven
weeks ago.  These palpitations will generally last ten to 30
seconds at a time, and are not related to any specific
activity.  Over the past several months, the patient has
developed new onset exertional symptoms.  He was a very
active man, and quite involved in golfing and swimming.  He
has been noting upper mid-chest pressure with swimming, or
after walking ten minutes at a brisk pace.  These symptoms
always resolve with rest.  Prior cardiac testing has
included:  Echocardiogram on [**2167-7-9**], which showed an
ejection fraction of 60% with mild left ventricular
hypertrophy and trace mitral regurgitation.  Exercise stress
test on [**2167-11-10**] with eight minutes of [**Doctor First Name **] protocol, no
anginal symptoms, electrocardiogram with [**Street Address(2) 1766**] depressions
inferolaterally.  Imaging revealed a medium in size, moderate
in degree, reversible anteroseptal defect.  There was also a
small inferoapical reversible defect.  Ejection fraction of
55%, with mild anteroseptal wall hypokinesis.

Subsequent cardiac catheterization on this admission showed
severe triple vessel coronary artery disease at which time
Cardiothoracic Surgery was consulted for a coronary artery
bypass graft.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 70**] met with the patient and
explained the risks and benefits to the patient, and it was
decided to proceed with an operation.

On [**2167-11-23**], the patient was brought to the operating room,
where a coronary artery bypass graft x 3 was performed.  The
left internal mammary artery was brought to the left anterior
descending, saphenous vein graft was brought to the distal
right coronary artery, and saphenous vein graft was brought
to the obtuse marginal.  Cardiopulmonary bypass time was 80
minutes.  Cross-clamp time was 46 minutes.  The patient
tolerated the procedure well, and was brought to the CSRU in
stable condition, extubated.

On postoperative day two, the patient continued to do well,
and had his chest tube and Foley removed.  His Lopressor was
increased to 50 mg by mouth twice a day secondary to
tachycardia in the 110s to 120s.  His tachycardia persisted
for several days after, without symptoms.  The patient had no
temperature and no specific complaints of pain.  His blood
pressure remained in the 130s to 140s/60s.

On postoperative day number five, the patient was started on
atenolol 100 mg and Diltiazem 240 mg by mouth once daily, at
which time his heart rate was found to be in the 70s with a
blood pressure in the 100 to 110s/60s.  The patient did quite
well, and was discharged in good condition without any other
events.
