Service: CARDIOTHORACIC

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1505**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2133-1-16**] Aortic Valve Replacement(21mm St. [**Male First Name (un) 923**] Porcine Tissue
Valve)


History of Present Illness:
This is a 84 yoM with PMH of Hypertension, Aortic Stenosis,
Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation, Congestive Heart Failure who is
transferred from [**Hospital **] Hospital for Cardiac catheterization
for evaluation of Aortic Stenosis and possible need for surgical
correction.
.
The patient reports that he has never had SOB.  His SOB began
the day of his 1st admission to [**Location (un) **].  The patient states
that he was lying in bed and became SOB, he denies CP,
palpitations, N/V or diaphoresis.  He called EMS and was
admitted to [**Location (un) **] and discharged with a diagnosis of CHF.  The
patient states that he was feeling much better when he got home.
 The following day he awoke from sleep with bad SOB.  He tried
walking to the bathroom but was severely SOB and called EMS.
Again, he denied CP, palpitations, N/V or diaphoresis.  He also
denies recent fevers, chills, or cough.  Prior to these episodes
he denies DOE.  The patient states he was very active and was
able to perform activities such as mowing his lawn for 2 hours
without SOB.
.
Per report from [**Location (un) **], Aortic valve area is 0.9cm2 with a mean
gradient of 71mmHG.
Patient is now s/p cardiac cath.  Currently he denies SOB, CP,
orthopnea, palpitations, N/V or diaphoresis.  He has no other
complaints.
.
On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or
red stools. He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors. He denies
exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other review of
systems were negative.
.
*** Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest
pain, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

[**2133-1-13**] Cardiac Cath:
1.  Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system

revealed single vessel coronary artery disease.  The LMCA had no

angiographically apparent flow-limiting stenoses.  The LAD had a
distal
100% occlusion with collaterals from the RCA.  The LCX had a 40%

proximal stenosis.  The RCA had no angiographically apparent
coronary
artery disease.
2.  Resting hemodynamics revealed normal right sided filling
pressures
with RVEDP of 7 mm Hg.  There were mildly elevated left sided
filling
pressures with LVEDP of 22 mm Hg and PCWP mean of 20 mm Hg.
Cardiac
index was preserved at 2.7 l/min/m2.  There was moderate to
severe
aortic stenosis with mean gradient of 33 mm Hg and calculated
valve area
of 0.7 cm2.  There was mild pulmonary arterial hypertension of
41/17 mm
Hg.  Systemic arterial pressure was normal at 136/71 mm Hg.
3.  Left ventriculography was deferred.

[**2133-1-14**] Carotid Ultrasound:
Minimal plaque with bilateral less than 40% carotid stenosis.

[**2133-1-14**] Transthoracic ECHO:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Color-flow imaging of the
interatrial septum raises the suspicion of an atrial septal
defect, but this could not be confirmed on the basis of this
study. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The
left ventricular cavity size is normal. There is mild to
moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with mid
to distal septal, anterior and apical hypokinesis. No masses or
thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. There is no ventricular
septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets are severely
thickened/deformed. There is moderate to severe aortic valve
stenosis (area 0.8 cm2). Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild to moderate
([**12-10**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The estimated pulmonary
artery systolic pressure is normal. There is no pericardial
effusion.

[**2134-1-18**] Chest CT Scan:
1. No evidence of sternal dehiscence or sternotomy wire
fracture.
2. Subcutaneous air, pneumomediastinum, and pneumopericardium
consistent with post-surgical state. Small right basilar
pneumothorax.
3. Small bilateral effusions and bibasilar atelectasis.

Brief Hospital Course:
On admission, he underwent cardiac catheterization which
confirmed aortic valve stenosis. Angiography revealed a right
dominant system and single vessel coronary artery disease(see
result section for further detail). Cardiac surgery was
consulted and additional preoperative evaluation was performed.
A carotid ultrasound showed only minimal disease while
preoperative echocardiogram showed an LVEF of 45%, mod-severe
aortic stenosis with mild aortic insufficiency, and only mild to
moderate mitral regurgitation. Preoperative workup was otherwise
unremarkable, and he was cleared for surgery.

On [**1-16**], Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] performed an aortic valve
replacement. Given his hospital stay was greater than 24 hours,
Vancomycin was utilized for perioperative antibiotics. For
surgical details, please see seperate dictated operative note.
Following the operation, he was brought to the CVICU for
invasive monitoring. Within 24 hours, he awoke neurologically
intact and was extubated without incident. He was noted to have
a slight decline in renal function. His creatinine peaked to 1.8
on postoperative three. Due to mild hypotension, he was
gradually weaned from Neosynephrine. His hemodynamics gradually
improved and he eventually converted back to atrial fibrillation
and was restarted on Coumadin. On postoperative day four, he was
transferred to the SDU for further care and recovery. His renal
function continued to improve. Over several days, medical
therapy was optimized and he continued to make clinical
improvements with diuresis. He remained in a rate controlled
atrial fibrillation and tolerated low dose beta blockade. By
postoperative day seven, he was medically cleared for discharge
to rehab. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 40075**] will continue to monitor his INR as an
outpatient.
