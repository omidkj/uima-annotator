Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 11495**]
Chief Complaint:
chest pain and shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
1)Cardiac catheterization with stenting of left circumflex
artery with DES
2)Surgical exploration of the retroperitoneal space

History of Present Illness:
The patient is an 82 yo female with HTN, CAD s/p MI x 2 (94 and
99), CHF (EF 55-60% [**2148**]), afib, NSVT, COPD with recent flare
who presented to [**Hospital3 3583**] with an episode of rest angina,
was found to be in rapid afib with rate 140 and returned back to
NSR after Diltiazem. She was found to have a TnI of 0.3 (pos
>.4, neg < .04), so she was sent to [**Hospital1 18**] for cardiac
catheterization.
.
She had been admitted there approximately three weeks ago for a
COPD exacerbation and had been home for a week when these
symptoms began.  She was going to walk her dog when she
developed sudden onset chest pressure, similar to anginal and
pre-infarct sx she had before.  She took two ntg that failed to
relieve her sx, so she went into [**Hospital3 3583**].  There she was
in rapid afib with rate 140 and was initially rate controlled
with Diltiazem and spontaneously converted to NSR.  She also was
found to have ST-depressions in V5-V6 and a TnI of 0.3 (with
normal CKs) so was sent to [**Hospital1 18**] for cath.
.
Here, at the time of cath, she was found to have severe PVD with
an occluded right iliac and a narrowed aortic lumen; she had a
cypher stent placed in the LCX.  Immediately post-cath, she
denied ongoing sx.

ROS: Denies LH, chest pain, palpitations, orthopnea, pnd, le
edema, dyspnea, cough, sputum, wheeze, abd pain, n/v/d, dysuria,
hematuria, or frequency.  She is, however, constipated.

[**11-25**] Cath: COMMENTS:
1. Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system
revealed a single vessel CAD.  The LMCA was patent.  The LAD had
mild
non-obstrcutive disease.  The LCx had an 80% proximal stenosis.
The RCA
had a 30% proximal and a 50% distal stenoses.
2. Resting hemodynamics revealed a normal left sided filling
pressure.
There was a moderate systemic arterial hypertension with SBP of
160 mm
Hg.
3. Left ventriculography was deferred.
4. There was difficulty with right femoral access.  Having
obtained a
femoral access on the left, an abdomianl aortography revealed an

occluded right external iliac artery and a 60% stenosis at the
origin of
the right common iliac artery.  Left iliac artery was patent.
There was
a diffuse aortic atherosclerosis with a 70% distal stenosis, an
infrarenal aneurism and a 20 mm Hg gradient.
5. The lesion in the proximal LCX was predilated with a 2.0 mm
balloon
and stented with a 2.5 mm Cypher stent with lesion reduction to
80%. The
final angiogram showed TIMI III flow with no residual stenosis,
no
dissection and no embolisation. (see PTCA comments)

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. One vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Normal LV diastolic function.
3. Occluded right external iliac artery, stenosed right common
iliac
artery.
4. Diffuse aortic atherosclerosis; distal aortic stenosis;
infrarenal
aneurism.
5. Succesful stenting of the LCX lesion (drug eluting)
.
CT abd and pelvis: IMPRESSION:
1. Largest right-sided retroperitoneal hematoma extending from
the base of the right kidney downward into the right groin with
a likely active extravasation overlying the right common iliac
vessel.
2. Small hypodensities within the right and left lobes of the
liver not completely characterized in this study characterized
on this study.
3. Bilateral low density kidney lesions not completely
characterized on the study. If there is further clinical concern
ultrasound can be performed both on the liver and kidneys for
better evaluation not emergently.
4. Adrenal adenoma.
.
TEE:
Conclusions:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. No mass/thrombus is seen
in the left  atrium or left atrial appendage. Left ventricular
wall thicknesses are normal. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is mildly depressed. The calculated  myocardial
performance index was 0.35 (MPI A = 4460. ms; MPI B = 331 ms).
Tissue velocity imaging E/e' is elevated (>15) suggesting
increased left  ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
Transmitral Doppler and tissue  velocity imaging are consistent
with Grade II (moderate) LV diastolic  dysfunction. Resting
regional wall motion abnormalities include mild inferior  wall
hyppokinesia.. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are  normal. There is no mass/thrombus in the right
ventricle. The aortic root is  moderately dilated. The ascending
aorta is mildly dilated. There are complex  (>4mm) atheroma in
the ascending aorta. There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in  the
aortic arch. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally
normal with
good leaflet excursion. Moderate (2+) aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral  valve leaflets are structurally normal. Mild
(1+) mitral regurgitation is  seen. The left ventricular inflow
pattern suggests impaired relaxation. There  is mild pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is a small to moderate
sized pericardial effusion. The effusion appears loculated.


Brief Hospital Course:
This is an 82F with CAD, CHF, pAfib, h/o nsvt, PVD, and a recent
COPD flare admitted to [**Hospital3 3583**] with afib with RVR and
demand ischemia. She was transferred here and received a LCX
DES. Post cath the pt became hypotensive and received ~2L NS
with little response in BP. She complained of some LBP and was
diaphoretic with nausea. Dopamine was started and the patient
had a CT scan which showed a large right-sided RP bleed.
Vascular surgery was consulted, did an angiogram which did
