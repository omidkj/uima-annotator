Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 618**]
Chief Complaint:
R sided weakness, N/V, aphasia


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
Pt. is a 50 year old woman, listed in OSH records as having
no PMH, who is transferred for further management of ICH.

Husband reports that pt. had been in her USOH all day today.
She
did not complain of any headache, and she was not confused or
lethargic, or not herself.  Around 7:00 he was in the house and
she came in from the back yard and said "I can't move my right
arm.  I think I'm having a stroke."  She slumped down on a
chair.
He called EMS right away.  By the time they got there he felt
that she was slurring her speech somewhat.

Per OSH records, pt. was brought in to their ED at 7:30.  EMS
described that they saw a R facial droop, R sided weakness, and
aphasia on their exam.  She vomited en route to the hospital.
Ot
the hospital CT scan showed a large L BG hemorrhage with midline
shift.  She was intubated at 8:30 (with etomidate, lidocaine,
succ) and given 50 g Mannitol and 80 mg IV Lasix.  Her exam is
listed at pipoint pupils bilaterally, R facial droop, R
hemiparesis, and aphasia.  Her initial BP was 240/150 and she
was
given Labetalol 20 mg IV x 2, then started on a Labetalol gtt at
1 mg/min for BP control.  She was transferred here for further
management.

Pertinent Results:
[**2114-7-22**] CT head without contrast.
Large left basal ganglia intraparenchymal hemorrhage with
intraventricular extension with associated midline shift,
vasogenic edema and mass effect upon the pons and third
ventricle.

[**2114-7-24**]  MR [**First Name (Titles) 430**]
[**Last Name (Titles) **]: Large hemorrhage is again seen in the region of the
left basal ganglia and left thalamus. This is associated with
diffuse cerebral edema and effacement of sulci. Again seen is
approximately 1.4 cm rightward shift of normally midline
structures. Left uncal herniation is redemonstrated, along with
cerebellar tonsillar herniation. There are punctate cerebellar
hemorrhages that were not appreciated on CT.

Infarction is again seen in the left parietal lobe in the
distribution of the MCA. There is also infarction in the left
occipital lobe in a watershed distribution. There is a region of
infarction in the left basal ganglia which is not involved by
the hemorrhage. There is a region of infarction in the right
frontal lobe anterior watershed distribution and several small
areas of infarction of the right deep white matter consistent
with deep watershed distribution.

IMPRESSION:
1. Multiple regions of infarction as described above.
2. Large hemorrhage in the left basal ganglia and thalamus is
redemonstrated. There are also punctate hemorrhages in the
cerebellum.
3. Subfalcine herniation with 1.4 cm shift to the right. Left
uncal herniation is again seen, along with cerebellar tonsillar
herniation.
4. Due to distortion of the basal ganglia and arterial
contamination, the deep cerebral veins are not well visualized
and thrombosis cannot be ruled out. It is possible that the left
internal cerebral vein may be compressed or distorted by
hemorrhage versus thrombosed.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the NeuroICU.  Her exam deteriorated
over the course of her stay.  Her right pupil became enlarged
and unresponsive to light.  Based on the catastrauphic bleed and
subsequent ischemia due to left MCA compression by the bleed the
patient's family decided to refocus the goals of care on
comfort.  The patient passed away shortly after discontinuing
life prolonging measures.

Medications on Admission:
