Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1973**]
Chief Complaint:
Fall

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Right hip hemiarthroplasty

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 17562**] is an 80 year old female with a history of previously
undiagnosed emphysema (no pulmonary function tests on record)
who was transferred from an outside hospital after a right
femoral neck fracture status post mechanical fall.  She was
outside on [**2121-8-18**] walking her dogs when she missed a
brick step, falling to her right side. She was able to ambulate
afterwards into her home, where she called the ambulance. She
did not hit her head, denies loss of consiousness, and has full
recollection of the event. She denies headaches/visual changes.
She was taken to an outside hospital, found to have right hip
fracture and an increasing oxygen requirement. She got 2mg IV
dilaudid and was transferred to [**Hospital3 **] for further care.

In the [**Hospital3 **] Emergency Department, her initial vital signs
were 98 80 172/105 18 87% RA. She was put on 4L NC, with
saturations improving to 92%. She was then placed on facemask
with Fi02 50%, satting at 96%. She was given Zofran once for
nausea. The ED ordered a CT thorax, which was negative for PE
but did demonstrate severe emphysema as well as a large hiatal
hernia. Ortho was consulted.  She underwent right hip
arthroplasty on [**2121-8-19**] without complication under general
anesthesia. She had 200 mL EBL, received 800 mL LR with 200 mL
urine output (net positive 400 mL). She was intubated and
extubated without difficulties. In the peri-operative period,
she received ancef x 2 doses.

In the PACU, she had persistent requirement of facemask and
nasal cannula for adequate oxygenation. At one point, she was
weaned to 4 L NC with pOx 86-90 but upon falling asleep was
requiring facemask and nasal cannula in high 70s/low 80s. She
was given duoneb x 1 with minimal imiprovement.

ROS otherwise positive for intermittent GERD and occasional
urinary frequency at night. Ms. [**Known lastname 17562**] has "lung problems" at
baseline, as per her PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) **] has an extensive smoking history,
but quit 10 years ago. As per patient, she has never required
oxygen and has never been diagnosed with COPD. She does become
'fatigued' with exertion however. Denies chronic cough. Denies
wheezing. Denies paroxysmal nocturnal dyspena or orthopnea. She
was transferred to the floor on [**2121-8-21**] after her oxygen
saturations improved.

Past Medical History:
- Hiatal hernia: has known about this for quite some time, s/p
EGD last month to evaluate. Patient has intermittent GERD, was
offered surgery by GI but refused.
- emphysema: no formal PFTs on record
- denies other medical history


Social History:
Lives in [**Location 3615**] with partner, works as real estate [**Doctor Last Name 360**],
150 pack year smoking history, quit 10 years ago. 1 drink/day.
No drugs. At baseline walks without assistive devices



Family History:
father - diabetes, mother - healthy brother - died of MI in his
50s

IMAGING:
CXR [**2121-8-19**]: No acute cardiothoracic process.  Large hiatal
hernia containing at least stomach.

CT Chest [**8-19**]- INDICATION:  80-year-old with hypoxia after fall
(hip fracture).
TECHNIQUE:  CT angiography of the chest was obtained with
arterial phase
imaging. Axial, coronal, sagittal and oblique reformats were
acquired.
COMPARISON: None.
FINDINGS:
CTA OF THE CHEST:
There is no pneumomediastinum, mediastinal hemorrhage,
pericardial or large
pleural effusion.  There is no pulmonary embolism.  There are
moderate-to-severe atherosclerotic calcifications of the
thoracic aorta and
the coronary arteries. Moderate-to-severe centrilobular
emphysema is seen most pronounced in the upper lobes. There is a
right azygos lobe (incidental finding).
There is a large Bochdalek hernia containing fat, stomach
(upside down
stomach), and colon (with diverticula) without evidence of bowel
obstruction or gastric strangulation. This large hernia causes
streak-like atelectasis of the right lower lobe. The partially
visualized abdomen demonstrates a left liver lobe cystic lesion,
likely a simple cyst or hemangioma.
BONES:  There is moderate to severe osteopenia.  There are no
suspicious lytic or sclerotic bony lesions.

IMPRESSION:
1. Large hiatal hernia containing fat, stomach (upside down
stomach), and
colon (with diverticula) - no obstruction or acute findings.
2. No pulmonary embolism.
3. Severe atherosclerotic disease of the thoracic aorta and
coronary arteries.
4. Severe centrilobular emphysema.
5. Left liver lobe cystic lesion, likely cyst or hemangioma.
6. Moderate to severe osteoporosis.

[**2121-8-20**] Hip XRay:
INDICATION:  80-year-old after fall.
FINDINGS:  There is a fracture of the right femoral neck
fracture with varus angulation.  No fracture of the pelvic
bones, femur, proximal tibia of fibula. There are mild
degenerative changes of the right knee joint with joint space
narrowing.  Atherosclerotic calcification are seen at the
superifical femoral and popliteal arteries.
IMPRESSION:  Right femoral neck fracture with varus angulation.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 17562**] is an 80 year old female with a history of previously
undiagnosed emphysema (no pulmonary function tests on record),
transferred from an outside hospital after a right femoral neck
fracture status post mechanical fall, who had an uncomplicated
right hip hemiarthroplasty on [**8-19**], with post-operative course
complicated by hypoxemia.

ACTIVE ISSUES:
#Right femoral neck fracture- Patient transferred from OSH to
[**Hospital1 18**] for right hip hemiarthroplasty. No complications during
the surgery, EBL 200 cc. She was monitored in the MICU
afterwards due to hypoxemia (below). No evidence of vascular
compromi
