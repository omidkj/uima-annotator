and occasionally at rest. He also admited to exertional
shortness of breath. He denied syncope, orthopnea, PND, and
pedal
edema. Also admitted to intermittent palpitations from his
chronic atrial fibrillation, and described occasional
lightheadedness. Despite above symptoms, he remains extremely

unsteady gait and recent falls. He recently recovered from a

Pertinent Results:
TEE [**3-10**]: Conclusions
PRE-BYPASS:
The left atrium is markedly dilated. Mild spontaneous echo
contrast is seen in the body of the left atrium. [**Month/Year (2) **] to
severe spontaneous echo contrast is present in the left atrial
appendage. The left atrial appendage emptying velocity is
depressed (<0.2m/s). No thrombus is seen in the left atrial
appendage. The right atrium is markedly dilated.

There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. Due to
suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality
cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%). [Intrinsic right
ventricular systolic function may be depressed given the
[**Month/Year (2) 1192**] tricuspid regurgitation.]

There are focal calcifications in the aortic arch. There are
simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. The three
aortic valve leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. There is
critical aortic valve stenosis (valve area <0.8cm2). No
ascending aortic aneurysm is seen.

Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets
are mildly thickened. [**Month/Year (2) **] (2+) mitral regurgitation is
seen.

[**Month/Year (2) **] [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
POST-BYPASS:
The aortic bioprosthesis is well seated and functioning well
with a residual mean gradient of 10 mm of Hg across the valve.
No peri valvular leaks seen. LVEF 50%.
Mild to [**Month/Year (2) **] MR. Mild to [**Month/Year (2) **] TR. Dilated IVC like
prebypass.
RV function appears normal. Intact thoracic aorta.

CXR: [**2161-3-11**]:  All the lines with the exception of the right
internal jugular sheath have been removed. There is no
pneumothorax. Volume loss at the left lung base may be slightly
worse.

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient was admitted to the hospital on [**3-9**] from OSH long
standing history of AS. On [**3-10**] he was brought to the operating
room  where the patient underwent aortic valve replacement.
Please see intraoperative note for further details.` Overall the
patient tolerated the procedure well and post-operatively was
transferred to the CVICU in stable condition for recovery and
invasive monitoring. He initially required vasopressor and
phenylephrine for blood pressure support. Slow to wean from
ventilator but eventually weaned and extubated without
difficulty. On POD#1 he was extubated and off pressors.  He has
long history of rate control atrial fibrillation. Low dose
Lopressor, diuretics and ACE were initiated. His pre-operative
dose of prednisone for thrombocytopenia was restarted. He was
mildly confused post-operative and given his history of mild
dementia his Aricept was started and his mental status improved.
He transferred to the floor in POD#2.  Pacing Wires and chest
tube were removed per protocol. Anticoagulation therapy was
started.  He was evaluated by the physical therapy service for
assistance with strength and mobility.  He continued to make
steady progress and was discharged to [**Location (un) 15739**] Manor in NH
[**Telephone/Fax (1) 92122**] on [**2161-3-14**].  He will follow-up as an outpatient.
