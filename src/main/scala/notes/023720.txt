History of Present Illness:
Pt is a 57 year old male with a h/o htn admitted to [**Hospital 6451**] hospital on [**2-13**] with chest pain, viral symptoms,
dehydration, and acute renal failure. At the time of
presentation, he was complaining of 1 week of cough, congestion,
diarrhea, vomiting, and weakness. His cough was noted to be
productive of greenish-red sputum. He also noted some atypical
chest pain, occurring with coughing. with creat up to 3.4/bun
126.

At the OSH, he troponins were mildly elevated in the setting of
ARF but CKs were negative. ECG had ? of mild inferior ST
depressions. A pulmonary consultation was obtained for URI
symptoms and ? hemoptysis and he was started on levofloxacin for
bronchitis. Patient symptoms improved w/ abx and hydration on
the floor. A renal consultation was obtained and ARF was felt to
be due to dehydration. He ace inhibitor, hctz/triamterene were
held and his creat improved to 1.0 with IVF hydration. On
[**2122-2-16**] an ETT-MIBI was performed on which he completed 5
minutes of [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] protocol w/ 5/10 chest pain, 3mm global ST
depression, and nuclear imaging showed EF 31% with fixed
inferior and reversible anterior defects. He was then
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for catheterization.

In [**Hospital1 18**] cath lab, patient was found to have 2V CAD w/ 95% LAD
lesion and TO RCA w/ L->R collaterals. No intervention was
performed and CT surgery was consulted for potential CABG. Upon
transfer to the floor, patient is asymptomatic. He denies any
current chest pain or discomfort, SOB, nausea, diarrhea,
constipation. He does note a mild persistent cough.

On ROS, he notes a chest sensation similar to what he felt
during his ETT over the last several months with heavy exertion
ass with SOB. He denies any frank chest pain. No orthopnea, PND.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify I was present in compliance with HCFA
regulations. The patient was under general anesthesia throughout
the procedure. The TEE probe was passed with assistance from the
anesthesioology staff using a laryngoscope. No TEE related
complications.
Conclusions
Pre-CPB: No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the left atrial
appendage. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
severely depressed (LVEF= 25 - 30 %). with mild global RV
hypokinesis.The LV shows hypokinesis or akinesis of all walls
except the lateral wall.
There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending thoracic
aorta.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with
good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral
