Brief Hospital Course:
MICU Course:
The patient was admitted to the MICU due to black stools.  A
rectal exam done in the MICU revealed hard black stools that
were guiac positive.  He had no bowel movements while in the
MICU.  He was kept NPO and was given IV fluids and IV PPI.  He
had no melena or BRBPR.  He had mild abdominal pain, no nausea
or vomiting.  Serial HCTs were checked and were stable.  GI was
consulted in the morning on [**2131-10-15**].  The patient was otherwise
hemodynamically stable and asymptomatic.  He was continued on
his home medications with the exception of his blood pressure
medications and diuretics due to concerns for bleeding and
hemodynamic instability.  He was then called out the floor.
.
Hospital [**Hospital1 **] Course:
The patient was transfered to the floor. His HCT remained
stable; he did not require any transfusions. EGD and
colonoscopy were performed, which only demonstrated some mild
gastritis. Aspirin was decreased from 325mg daily to 81mg daily
and plavix was discontinued. Pantoprazole 40mg [**Hospital1 **] was started.
He had some residual symptoms of orthostasis but no further
bleeding or drop in HCT. As a result, lasix was decreased and
zaroxyln, spironolactone were stopped.  He was also noted to
have a UTI and was prescribed a course of Ciprofloxacin. He was
discharged with PCP and GI follow up.

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted with melena (dark stool that contains blood).
You remained hemodynamically stable during your hospitalization.
You received a colonoscopy and an EGD that revealed no frank
bleeding, but that did reveal gastritis (inflammation in the
wall of the stomach). You will need to see a gastroenterologist
approx. two to three weeks after discharge to follow-up on your
hospitalization.
.
You were additionally noted to have a urinary tract infection on
urinanalysis. You were started on an antibiotic to treat this
infection. Thus far, your urine cultures have not grown-out an
organism responsible for your UTI, and you will want to ask your
PCP to check on the final results at your follow-up appointment.
You will need to continue to take your antibiotic,
Ciprofloxacin, for another 5 days.
.
You were noted to be anemic (lower hemoglobin in the blood than
is typical) on admission. Your hematocrit, a laboratory value
used to track anemia, ranged from 27.5 to 33.
