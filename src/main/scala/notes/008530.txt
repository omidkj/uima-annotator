BRIEF HISTORY:
[**Known firstname 41028**] [**Known lastname **] is a 75 year old woman with hypertension,
hyperlipidemia,
prior tobacco use and positive family history of CAD. She has a
prior
history of CABG (LIMA to ramus, SVG to LAD, SVG to OM).  While
undergoing a bronchoscopic procedure for ablation of a bronchial

carcinoid tumour, the patient suffered a cardiac arrest.
Resuscitation
was begun, TEE revealed that there was air in the left
ventricle. The
patient was placed on extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation and
transferred emergently to the cath lab.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Two vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Patent SVGs to LAD and OM2.
3. Air in left ventricle

UNILAT UP EXT VEINS US LEFT  [**2122-7-27**] 10:37 AM

UNILAT UP EXT VEINS US LEFT

Reason: LUE SWELLING

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
75 year old woman with New onset of left upper ext swelling with
history of CVL on that side
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
? left upper extrem DVT
INDICATION: 75-year-old female with history of new-onset left
upper extremity swelling and history of central venous catheter
on that side.

COMPARISON: Left upper extremity ultrasound dated [**2122-7-24**].

LEFT UPPER EXTREMITY ULTRASOUND: Grayscale, color flow and
Doppler ultrasound of the left internal jugular, subclavian,
brachial, cephalic and basilic veins were obtained. Color flow
and Doppler ultrasound only of the axillary vein was performed.
Although compression of the axillary vein was not performed,
relative loss of color flow was demonstrated within the axillary
vein. Normal flow, augmentation, compressibility and waveforms
were demonstrated in the right internal jugular, brachial veins
were seen. The cephalic vein was not previously imaged and
demonstrates non-compressibility consistent with intraluminal
thrombus.

IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of left axillary DVT extension.
2. Limited exam of the left axillary vein. No visualized
thrombus is seen, with demonstrated normal wall- to wall flow.
If clinical concern persists, reimaging with axillary vein could
be performed at no additional charge for the patient.
3. Intraluminal thrombus of the left cephalic vein, which was
not previously imaged.
RADIOLOGY  Final Report

BILAT LOWER EXT VEINS  [**2122-7-27**] 10:37 AM

BILAT LOWER EXT VEINS

Reason: LLE CLOT

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
75 year old woman with New onset of left lower ext swelling with
history of CVL on that side
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
? left lower extrem DVT
INDICATION: 75-year-old female with new onset of left lower
extremity swelling, and history of central venous catheter
placement. Evaluate for left lower extremity DVT.

COMPARISON: Left lower extremity ultrasound dated [**2122-7-24**].

LEFT LOWER EXTREMITY ULTRASOUND: Grayscale, color flow, and
Doppler imaging of the left common femoral, superficial femoral,
and popliteal veins were performed. As previously indicated,
thrombus is seen extending from the popliteal vein through the
superficial femoral vein, and into the common femoral and
greater saphenous vein. There has been no significant interval
resolution or progression of the identified thrombus. Although a
normal waveform is demonstrated within the mid and distal
superficial femoral vein, no visualized color flow is
demonstrated, and no compression was visualized.

IMPRESSION: Essentially occlusive thrombus extending from the
popliteal vein through the mid superficial femoral vein.
Partially occlusive thrombus in the greater saphenous, and
common femoral veins. These findings are unchanged from prior
study dated [**2122-7-24**].





Brief Hospital Course:
BRIEF HISTORY:
[**Known firstname 41028**] [**Known lastname **] is a 75 year old woman with hypertension,
hyperlipidemia,
prior tobacco use and positive family history of CAD. She has a
prior
history of CABG (LIMA to ramus, SVG to LAD, SVG to OM).  While
undergoing a bronchoscopic procedure for ablation of a bronchial

carcinoid tumour, the patient suffered a cardiac arrest.
Resuscitation
was begun, TEE revealed that there was air in the left
ventricle. The
patient was placed on extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation and
transferred emergently to the cath lab. There was a visible
pocket of air in the left ventricular cavity. A pigtail catheter
was advanced into the LV and used to aspirate the air. There was
reduction in the appearance of the air pocket on fluoroscopy.
When maximal efforts to aspirate the air were completed, the
patient
was defibrillated with one shock and sinus rhythm was restored.
Small
doses of levophed were used to maintain blood pressure. The
patient was
placed on the ventilator with good oxygenation and CO2 exchange.

Uncrossmatched blood was administered with improvement in
filling
pressures. Fluroscopy did not reveal any evidence of
pneumothorax. The patient was transferred to surgery for removal
of the ECMO
cannulas.
Patient supported in ICU and successfully extubated and weaned
of pressors and transferred to floor. Pt made DNR/DNI per her
wishes in agreement w/ family. Was recovering well and
approaching discharge to previous inpatient facility.
POD#8- Pt found unresponsive w/ agonal respirations with stable
hemodynamics. Family wished no further intervention and comfort
measures to be a priority and were initiated. Pt expired at 1806
with family at bedside. Pronounced by thoracic team. Attending
physician [**Name Initial (PRE) 23491**].
