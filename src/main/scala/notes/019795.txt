Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5790**]
Chief Complaint:
Right lower lobe lung cancer


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2124-12-15**]: Flexible bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage,
right thoracotomy and right lower lobectomy with sleeve
bronchoplasty (tubular bronchoplasty of the right middle lobe
for reanastomosis), mediastinal lymph node dissection,
intercostal muscle flap buttress, and pericardial flap buttress.

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 7168**] is a 63-year-old gentleman with a right lower lobe
squamous cell carcinoma with endobronchial invasion at the level
of the superior segment and distal bronchus intermedius. He had
undergone previous cervical mediastinoscopy which was negative
for any mediastinal nodal disease. He then underwent 8 weeks of
pulmonary rehab. He symptomatically felt much better though his
post rehab pulmonary function tests were still severely impaired
with an FEV1 of 47% of predicted and a DLCO 50% of predicted.
His cardiopulmonary exercise testing, however, revealed a VO2
max of 21.8 mL/kg per minute.  He was admitted for lobectomy or
possible bilobectomy with the help that we could simply do a
right lower lobectomy; but in order to get an adequate bronchial
margin, this would likely require a tubular bronchoplasty or
reanastomosis of the right middle lobe onto the bronchus
intermedius.


Past Medical History:
1.  COPD, currently undergoing pulmonary rehab to pursue
surgical
resection of the right lower lobe squamous cell carcinoma.
2.  History of pneumonia treated with antibiotics as described
above.
3.  Abdominal hernia
4.  Hypertension.
5.  Cervical spine surgery.  The details are not available to us
at this time.
6.  Basal cell carcinoma.
7.  History of polypectomy in [**6-/2118**] on colonoscopy. 3-cm as
well as a 1 cm inflammatory polyp.


Social History:
The patient is married and accompanied by his wife. [**Name (NI) **] has two
children. 80-pack-year history of tobacco. He quit approximately
three months ago. Prior heavy alcohol consumption; he quit at
the time of his diagnosis. He worked in a nuclear power plant in
[**Location (un) 3320**], [**State 350**] for approximately 24 years. The patient
describes having significant radiation exposure during that
period of time.


Family History:
There is no family history of any carcinomas.

Brief Hospital Course:
Pt was admitted on [**2124-12-15**] and taken to the OR for flexible
bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage, right thoracotomy and
right lower lobectomy with sleeve bronchoplasty (tubular
bronchoplasty of the right middle lobe for reanastomosis),
mediastinal lymph node dissection, intercostal muscle flap
buttress, and pericardial
flap buttress. A paravertebral catheter was placed for pain
control w/ PCA w/ excellent effect. 2 chest tubes were placed at
the time of surgery for drainage and to assist w/ lung
re-expansion.

[**Name (NI) **], pt was admitted to the ICU for invasive respiratory and
hemodynamic monitoring.
POD#2 Went into rapid afib; he was placed on IV lopressor, then
IV amiodarone was added for conversion and better rate control
w/ good effect. Chest tubes w/ moderate serosang output.
Continued to require aggressive pulmonary tiolet.
POD#4 Transferred to floor from the ICU. Removed one chest tube.
 Eval by PT.
POD#5 Mucous plug w/ desats. Transferred back to ICU. Attempted
flex bronch but secretions too thick. Intubated and re-bronched
w/ thick secretions of right and left bronchial tree. Started on
vanco/zosyn empirically. Anastomotic site intact.
