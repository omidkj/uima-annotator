Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1267**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2122-10-8**] Cardiac Catheterization
[**2122-10-12**] Placement of an IABP
[**2122-10-12**] Aortic Valve Replacement(19mm St. [**Male First Name (un) 923**] Porcine) and
Three Vessel Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting(LIMA to LAD, SVG to

History of Present Illness:
Mrs. [**Known lastname **] is a 88 year old female with a history of aortic
stenosis who presented to an outside hospital on [**2122-10-5**] with
acute shorteness of breath. She was found to have acute
pulmonary edema thought to be secondary to dietary indiscretion,
aortic stenosis, and URI. She was found initially to have
hypertension treated with biPAP and lasix with improvement of
her breathing. While admitted the patient did have cardiac
enzyme elevation that was thought to be secondary to LV strain
rather than acute coronary syndrome. Upon arrival to the [**Hospital1 18**],
the patient is asymptomatic. She had no shortness of breath,
chest pain, nausea or vomiting. She reported that she has had no
dyspnea in 12 hours and has been off 02 since arrival to [**Hospital1 18**].
She confirms that she had high salt intake prior to the
admission to the OSH but otherwise has had no change in her
medications or symptoms including no preceeding chest pain,
nausea or palpitations. ROS + for increasing cough without
sputum prior to admission negative except as above including no
bleeding, syncope, fatigue, fever, chills, nausea, vomiting


Past Medical History:
Chronic Diastolic Cardiac Dysfunction
Hypertension
Aortic stenosis
Dyslipidemia
Glaucoma
s/p appendectomy, left knee surgery, cataract surgery and
hysterectomy


Social History:
Distant smoking history, occ etoh, no illicits, lives alone in
Rye, has daughter who is HCP [**Name (NI) **] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 95201**] or [**Telephone/Fax (1) 95202**]

Family History:
No family history of early cardiac events or sudden death.

[**2122-10-8**] Cardiac Cath:
1. Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system
demonstrated 3-vessel coronary artery disease. The LMCA was
heavily calcified with an ostial stenosis of 40-50% and a distal
stenosis of 30-40%. The LAD was heavily calcified with a
proximal 30% stenosis and a mid 70% after the take off of a
modest D1. The LAD had diffuse disease in the mid to distal
portion of the vessel. The LCX was heavily calcified with
diffuse disease to 50% proximally with a mid stenosis of 60-70%
before an aneurysmal segment from which small OM3 and a large
OM4 arose. The OM5/LPL had a proximal tubular stenosis of 60%. A
small high OM1 has a moderate stenosis at its origin. The RCA
was heavily calcified with diffuse disease throughout to 60% mid
vessel. The RPDA had a proximal 70% stenosis.
2. Resting hemodynamics revealed mildly elevated left
ventricuHg. There was mild systolic pulmonary artery pressures
with 32 mmHg. The cardiac index was normal at 2.3 L/min/m2.
There was mild systolic arterial blood pressure at 140 mmHg with
a systemic vascular resistance of 1897 dynes/s-1/cm-5. There was
severe aortic stenosis with a mean gradient of 67 mmHg and a
calculated valve area of 0.5 cm2 (based on an assumed VO2 and an
UNDERESTIMATE in the setting of aortic regurgitation).
3. Left ventriculography showed a preserved ejection fraction at
71% with normal regional wall motion and a stroke volume index
of 49 mL/m2.

[**2122-10-9**] Carotid Ultrasound:
Less than 40% right ICA stenosis. 40-59% left ICA stenosis.

[**2122-10-9**] Chest CT Scan:
1. Moderate cardiomegaly with coronary artery and aortic
calcifications, as well as calcification of the aortic valve and
milder calcification of the mitral annulus. No evidence of acute
pulmonary infection or pulmonary edema. Small right greater than
left pleural effusions with associated compressive atelectasis
in the lower lobes. 2. Incidentally noted small pulmonary
nodules measuring up to 4 mm. In a patient without strong risk
factors for intrathoracic malignancy, no followup is recommended
per the [**Last Name (un) 8773**] guidelines.
