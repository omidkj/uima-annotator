Chest x ray [**2148-7-29**]:

Portable AP chest radiograph was compared to [**2148-7-16**].

torso have improved in the interim. There is no appreciable
pleural effusion or pneumothorax.

Brief Hospital Course:
MICU COURSE:
53 year old male with Hep B, new diagnosis of HCC with invasion
to IVC and right atrium and right multifocal PE previously
Lovenox who is admitted to MICU with GI bleed.

# GI bleed: GI was consulted and EGD revealed bleeding duodenal
ulcer, s/p epinephrine injection. No eseophageal varices were
seen. H. Pylori positive on Ab test. Lovanox was held in setting
of GI bleed.  He was given a total of 5 UPRBC, FFP and Vit K. He
continued to have episodes of melena but HCT stabalized at 26
suggesting no further bleeding. Based on a detailed discussion
of the risks and benefits and benefits of treating his H pylori
with hepatology a decision was made to start him antibiotic
therapy.

#HCC:  The patient has a recent diagnosis of HCC. Disease is
extensive infiltrating IVC and right atrium.  Pt was offered
chemo, but has refused at this time given extent of disease. He
was in the process of being transferred to hospice care. He was
scheduled to see Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], onc as outpatient on the day of
admission. He was seen by palliative care and although he wished
to treat his acute GI bleed, he decided not want to pursue
treatment for his HCC.  His goals included getting home to be
with his family.

#Multifocal pulmonary emboli:  Given malignancy infiltration
into IVC and right atrium, uncertain if the embolies are due to
cancer infiltration or thrombus. He was started on lovenox
recently, but now presented with GI bleed. His anticoagulation
was held in the setting of bleeding. It was not thought that an
IVC filter would be helpful in this case give that malignancy is
infiltrating into right atrium. He was kept on pneumoboots for
prophylaxis.

# DM: recent HgA1c of 8.6% on insulin at home (as per family 6
units at home) He was continued on insulin sliding scale.

# Pain: diffuse abd pain, tx with morphine prn with some effect,
it was changed to dilaudid with improved affect. Pt c/o pain in
the RUQ which is similar to chronic pain. He was encouraged to
ask for pain medications as needed so that his requirement could
be estimated. Abd pain improved during MICU stay. Palliative
care followed.  Patient was changed to a po regimen SL morphine
in order to prepare him for potential hospice transfer.

# code status: DNR/DNI - 90 min family meeting held upon arrival
to the floor. [**Name (NI) **] HCP did not want agressive meausures c/w
with note of [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1764**] on [**7-24**].
.
Disposition: hospice/[**Hospital1 1501**] in [**Location (un) 2251**] should patient become
stable.
