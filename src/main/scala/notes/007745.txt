CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Hypoxia, hypotension.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Patient is a [**Age over 90 **]-year-old female
with recent admission for colonic obstruction, deep venous
thrombosis complicated by GI bleed on heparin who developed
80s and increased to 92% on two liters.  She was also noted
to have a decreased blood pressure to 70/palp which improved
with IV fluids.  In the emergency room, blood, sputum and
urine cultures were sent.  The patient was started on
Ceftriaxone, Flagyl and Vancomycin for aspiration pneumonia.
Chest x-ray demonstrated white out of the right lung with
some left lower lobe collapse versus consolidation.  ABG on
aspiration in the past.

ABG 7.27, 62, 172 on nonrebreather.  Lactate at 1.3.

Chest x-ray with persistent right pleural effusion with
increase in size, near complete opacification of the right
hemithorax.  Left lower lobe consolidation versus collapse.

EKG per report, normal sinus rhythm with a rate of 63, left
bundle branch block and paced.

SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  CLOSTRIDIUM DIFFICILE COLITIS:  Patient was admitted to
the Intensive Care Unit and intubated secondary to worsening
respiratory status.  She had positive Clostridium difficile
which was treated with IV and p.o. Flagyl and Vancomycin for
one week.  She became hypotensive requiring pressors and
remained intubated for one week in the Intensive Care Unit.
The patient gradually improved.  After over 20 liters of IV
hydration, she came off pressors.  She had no other culture
date indicating sepsis.  Patient's Clostridium difficile
toxin cleared.

2.  RESPIRATORY FAILURE:  Patient originally required
intubation for hypoxia and acidosis.  That resolved initially
and she was extubated after seven days.  The patient went to
the floor for three days, developed increasing respiratory
and collapse of the right lung secondary to secretions.  The
patient was brought back to the Intensive Care Unit and
intubated on the 15th.  She underwent two thoracenteses each
withdrawing 1500 cc of fluid.  The pleural effusions were
exudate.  Cytology was negative.

Patient was gradually weaned off the ventilator again and
extubated.  She continued to have persistent respiratory
distress requiring frequent suctioning.  She was diuresed.
The patient had an extremely weak cough and was unable to
clear her secretions adequately.  She continued to have
atelectasis and collapse after her second extubation.

3.  CODE STATUS:  Multiple family discussions were held with
[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Known lastname 4640**] and [**Last Name (un) 16514**] [**Last Name (un) 16515**], her husband.  The family
initially wanted everything done in order to prolong her
life.  She was aggressively treated with intubation and
pressors for two weeks.  After her second extubation and
realization that she is too weak to clear her secretions and
continues to having difficulty with plugging and concerns for
future aspiration pneumonias, the family discussion with Mr.
[**Name14 (STitle) 16515**] and [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Known lastname 4640**], the decision was to make her a DNR,
DNR with no further intubations. She was continued on Lasix
and given Morphine for comfort.

Discharge status will be updated on an addendum.  Discharge
condition will be updated.
