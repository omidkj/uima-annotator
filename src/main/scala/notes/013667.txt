Allergies:
No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 905**]
Chief Complaint:
Lethargy

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation, Hemodialysis


History of Present Illness:
63 yo M with diabetes, CKD, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation s/p
recent ablation ([**11/2141**]) found down by family members for
uncertain duration. Altered, hypotensive, bradycardic, and with
fingerstick of 134 with EMS.
.
Upon arrival to the ED vitals were: T 96.7, HR 38, BP 125/73, RR
13, O2Sat 100% NRB. Had sinus brady upon arrival with QRS of
168. Got calcium and multiple amps of bicarb. Was intubated with
8.0 tube, though difficult intubation. With 5+ bicarb pushes,
QRS narrowed and HR increased. Because of these findings,
patient placed on bicarb drip. Toxic ingestion was entertained
and toxicology consult was called. Given hypotension and
bradycardia, patient started on dopamine at 10 mcg. Given
hypotension, was given 4L NS, had RIJ central line place, and
Vanc/Zosyn for epiric treatment of sepsis. 600 mg aspirin given
for potential MI. Patient had multiple imaging studies in ED
including CT head, CT c-spine, CT chest/abd/pelvis, all had
essentially and CXR. Vitals prior to transfer to the MICU were:
HR 70, BP 162/67, RR 23, O2Sat 100% on AC 550 by 20 with PEEP 5
and FiO2 100%.

CXR:
1. Endotracheal and nasogastric tubes in appropriate position.
2. Low lung volumes. Perihilar opacities may relate to pulmonary
edema,
although underlying aspiration cannot be excluded.
3. Enlarged cardiac silhouette. Prominent superior mediastinum,
may relate
to supine, AP technique. Recommend clinical correlation and
consider CT as
clinically warranted.

CT Chest:
1. Moderate bibasilar dependent atelectasis with focal
consolidations, which
may represent aspiration. Enlarged pretracheal lymph node,
likely reactive.
2. Numerous mesenteric and paraaortic lymph nodes.
3. Small sacular aneurysm of the infrarenal portion of the
aorta, measuring
2.6 cm in transverse diameter (on coronal image). Follow-up
ultrasound in 6
months can be performed to assess stability, given the lack of
comparison
studies.
4. Small hiatal hernia.
5. Fat-containing left inguinal hernia.

TTE:
IMPRESSION: stiff left ventricle with impaired relaxation and
preserved ejection fraction; moderate pulmonary hypertension
with a dilated hypocontractile right ventricle

Renal U/S: Normal renal ultrasound as described.

Brain MRI:
IMPRESSION:
1. A small focus of subacute hemorrhage seen in the right
occipital lobe not visualized on CT but seen as T1
hyperintensity on MR images with restricted diffusion in the
center on diffusion-weighted images.
2. Moderate-to-severe changes of small vessel disease and brain
atrophy seen.
3. Chronic infarcts in cerebellum and pons.
4. No MRI signs of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome.



Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 63 year old gentleman with diabetes, CKD, paroxysmal
atrial fibrillation s/p recent ablation ([**11/2141**]) found down by
family members for uncertain duration. Altered, hypotensive,
bradycardic, found to be acidemic, hyperkalemic on admission.
.
# ACIDEMIA/ACUTE ON CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE: On admission, patient
was tested for ingestion, and had negative serum ethanol,
methanol, aspirin and ethylene glycol.  Etiology of renal
failure felt to be acute on chronic in the setting of
over-diuresis due to recent increase in dose to 160mg [**Hospital1 **] from
120 qAM, 80qPM.  Renal was consulted on admission and placed a
temporary L IJ dialysis line.  Renal ultrasound was normal. His
renal failure, hyperkalemia gradually resolved without dialysis.
 Patient maintained good urine output throughout his ICU stay.
His renal function continued to improve with creatinine on
discharge 2.8. He was discharged on 80mg [**Hospital1 **] lasix.
.
# RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Intubated for airway protection in ED
given obtunded state. He was weaned from the ventilator and
extubated without complication. He was completeley weaned off
oxygen by discharge.
.
# Uremic Metabolic Encephalopathy: On admission neurology was
consulted.  EEG  was consistent with metabolic encephalopathy
and MRI demonstrated mp evdidence  of PRES. It is thought that
his acute change in mental status was most likely secondary to
uremia.  As his renal failure returned to his baseline, his
mental status improved. A small focus of subacute hemorrhage was
seen in right occipital lobe was visualized and on review by
neurology felt to be chronic. Chronic small vessel disease and
brain atrophy also noted.
.
# ATRIAL FIBRILLATION: While in the ICU, a 20-minute episode of
A-fib with RVR to 180s initially, then > 150s sustained. BP
initially fell to 90s but then rebounded without intervention.
The patient received 5mg IV metoprolol and returned into normal
sinus rhythm and was countinued on coumadin and restarted on
oral metoprolol.
.
# HYPERTENSION: The patient's extubation complicated by
significant hypertension with systolic blood pressures into the
220s. His home dose of hydralazine was increased and metoprolol
uptitrated.
.
# Elephantiasis verrucosa nostra: Dermatology was consulted and
recommended AmLactin lotion [**Hospital1 **] and leg wraps.
.
# HYPERNATREMIA: Patient was initially hypernatremic to the 150s
consistent with over diuresis.  This resolved with IV D5W.
.
# TROPONIN ELEVATION: Troponin T was elevated at 0.23 secondary
to demand ischemia.  Echocardiogram demonstrated diastolic
dysfunction, but no focal wall motion abnormalities of the LV.
.
# DIABETES MELLITUS TYPE 2: The patient was treated with insulin
sliding scale while admitted.  He was discharged on his home
dose of novalog and nph.  He was instructed to regularly check
his fingersticks and to call his physician if his blood sugar
was 60.
.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
# Medical Mangagement: Increased hydralazine to 75mg tid, lasix
80mg [**Hospital1 **], recommend outpatient evaluation of slee
