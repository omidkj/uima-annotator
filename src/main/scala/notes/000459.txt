IVC filter placement

History of Present Illness:
This is a 24 year old man admitted to the Neurosurgery Service
on
[**2111-5-14**] following flu like symptoms including neckache and
headache. Imaging of head and spine demonstrated Chiari
malformation/cervical and thoracic syringomyelia. Suboccipital
craniectomy was performed on [**2111-5-22**]. Post operative course was
complicated by R pulmonary artery PE. He was also treated for
possible pneumonia. There was some L arm weakness and L sided
arm
and leg numbness several days post operatively without clear
cause identified despite CT brain/repeat imaging of c-spine. He
was discharged to rehab on [**2111-6-2**].

He had been progressing well at rehab. INR had been low (1.45)
and increased coumadin given.  Also covered over last several
days with therapeutic doses of lovenox. Rehab
notes indicate anticipation of discharge home today. Unable to
participate in OT today due to neck pain and referred for MRI.
The patient notes increasing neck discomfort and headache over
the last 2 days. He has persistent LUE weakness much the same as
previously. Denies fall at rehab.

MRI was performed  at [**Hospital1 **] which showed postoperative
changes and small R paraspinal hematoma.  He was transferred
here
for further care.

The patient admits to some low mood recently.  Overwhelmed by
current illness. Appetite has been okay. He has no complaints of
fever, cough, rhinorrhoea, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, urinary
symptoms.

OSH MRI of c-spine shows rounded fluid collection in paraspinal
muscles on R side of cervical spine with fluid level. Possible
hematoma ?acute versus subacute. Post-operative changes with
seroma.

CT neck:
Large complex fluid collection in the surgical bed with
characteristics consistent with new hemorrhage in this region.
The mild enhancement could be post-operative, though infection
cannot be excluded.

NCHCT:No intracranial hemorrhage.  Postsurgical change in the
4th
ventricle, posterior fossa, and C1 related to recent surgery for
chiari malformation.

CXR: decr lung volumes, no consolidation

MRI c-spine [**6-10**]:
New hemorrhage into the fluid collection within the surgical
bed, causing increasing compression of the cervicomedullary
junction and an increase in the size of the syrinx. The new
enhancement of the dural graft could represent inflammation or
infection.


Brief Hospital Course:
24y man s/p posterior decompression for [**Doctor Last Name 1193**] Chiari
Malformation type 1 on [**2111-5-22**] with increasing
neck pain and headache. Examination showed progressive LUE
weakness and MRI of c-spine showed hematoma in operative site.
On the day of admission, he had decreased O2 saturation in ABG;
CTA done and acute PE was ruled out. Aspiration pneumonia was
indicated and is treated with ceftriaxone for 10 days. His ABG
improved to normal after the surgery.
Bilateral lower extremity ultrasound was also performed which no
evidence of DVT. The patient was taken to the OR for evacuation
of hematoma on [**2111-6-10**], following reversal of INR and IVC filter
placement.
The following day ([**6-11**]) patient was extubated, placed in a soft
collar and transferred to the step down unit. A hematology
consult was then obtained. Hematoloy recommended coumadin for
possible hypercoagulable state for 6 months while pulmonology
recommended no anticoagulation. After thorough discussion, it
was agreed that the patient should be anticoagulated and a
heparin drip was to be started POD 7 to reduce the risk of head
bleed. On [**6-12**] a speech and swallow consult was obtained and
after performing a bedside swallow they recommended that the pt
be advanced to a diet of thin liquid (by cup) and soft
consistency solids and pills were to be given whole or crushed.
Culture from the operating room showed no growth, blood culture
showed no growth; and sputum cultures were positive for GNR and
GPC, which was treated with ceftriaxone and placed on aspiration
precautions. On [**6-13**] patient's surgical drain was removed.
Patient is to continue on ceftriaxone until [**2111-6-20**] and to have
his soft collar in place for 2 weeks
