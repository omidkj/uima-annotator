Chief Complaint:
fatigue and progressive failure to thrive at home

endotracheal intubation
bone marrow biopsy
upper endoscopy


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname **] is a very nice 54 YO gentleman with CAD s/p MI
and h/o endocarditis s/p bioprosthetic AVR with recent history
of GIB requiring 6 RBC units comes to the emergency room with
fatigue and progressive failure to thrive at home. He was in his
prior state of health until 6 weeks ago when he presented to OSH
([**Doctor Last Name 4320**] Family in [**Location (un) 7661**]) with UGIB and required 6 RBC units. He
underwent an EGD, which showed an esophageal varix and did not
undergo any other procedure. He wast stabilied and sent home.
Since then, he has been dealing with severe neck pain and
headache that has progressed. It has been very difficult to
control even with narcotics. Patient was refered to our Spine
center and underwent MRI, which showed disc bulge at pretty much
all levels as well as This is suspicious for diffuse
infiltrative process or marrow abnormalities. Clinical
correlation is recommended to exclude metastatic disease or
myelodysplastic syndrome. He move at home with his brother, who
is his current primary care taker and has continued to
deteriorate. Currently he is bed-bound and needs help with all
his ADLs. His symptioms are mostly due to weakenss and pain. He
has had poor apetite and poor PO intake and has lost 15 pounds
within this time. He has had 3 falls due to weakness in the last
3 weeks without any head trauma or LOC. His PCP sent him to our
hospital to get an outpatient MRI given that his pain has
worsened significantly in his cervical spine, but given that he
was feeling very weak and deteriorating fast he was taken to our
ED.
.
In the ED his initial VS were: T 95.6 F, HR 107 BPM, BP 142/105
mmHg, RR 16 X', SpO2 97% RA. He looked cachectic, had clear
lungs, was very sleepy, but arousable, underwent NG lavage which
showed coffee ground and minimal bright red blood. He had brown
stools in the rectal vault that were guaiac positive. His labs
weere significant for WBC 9.5, HCT of 22 with PLT 216. His INR
was 1.1 with PTT of 25. Sodium was 117, K 4.6, Cl 82, AG 10, UA
was negative, BC were drawn. BUN 28, cr 0.6. He was with HR in
90s and BP in the 90s throught most of his ED stay. His repeat
HCT came back as 20 with Na of 117. GI was consulted, but felt
that his neck issues and hyponatremia were more improtant than
GIB and therefore scope was partially contraindicated in this
scenario and recommended correction of hyponatremia and further
evaluation of his spine. He is admitted to the ICU for further
work up. His VS prior to transfer are: 103 94/59 24 95% and he
has 3 18G peripherals. He is T&C.

MR [**Name13 (STitle) **] W &W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2174-5-9**] 5:32 PM
IMPRESSION:
1. Diffuse abnormal osseous marrow signal concerning for an
infiltrative
process such as myeloma, lymphoma, leukemia or metastases.
2. Likely pathologic fracture of the T12 vertebral body with
severe spinal
canal narrowing as described. More focal abnormal enhancement
within the
posterior elements of T12 and L1 suggests more severe osseous
involvement at these levels.
3. Circumferential epidural and dural enhancement at the L3 and
L4 levels is also suspicious for an infiltrative process such as
myeloma, lymphoma,
leukemia or metastases.
.
CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST Study Date of [**2174-5-10**] 1:56 PM
IMPRESSION:
1. Left lower lobe pneumonia.
2. Left upper lobe densities likely reflecting early pneumonia.
3. No evidence of malignancy on this study. However, given the
presence of a bony lesion within a recent cervical spine study,
a followup chest examination should be obtained following
resolution of the pneumonia to rule out an underlying mass.
4. Small bilateral pleural effusions.
5. Multiple hepatic cysts.
6. Hypod
