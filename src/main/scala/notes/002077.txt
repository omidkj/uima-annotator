History of Present Illness:
63 y.o man with history of type II [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **]-[**Last Name (Prefixes) **]'s disease and
history of GI bleeds presents with 2 week history of dark
stools.  The patient reports that 2 weeks ago he had a nosebleed
that lasted longer than his usual ones.  He then noticed that

had no real complications aside from epistaxis until [**1-2**] when
he developed dyspnea, presented to the ED, and was found to have
UGIB with hct 15. He underwent EGD with clipping of the duodenal
blub and then required angiography with gastroduodenal artery
coiling, Humate 6, IVIG, and 16units pRBCs before his hct
stabilized at 22. After discharge he was seen in heme/onc clinic
and received IV iron for continued anemia. His hcts trended from
22-33 over the last two months.
.

Brief Hospital Course:
1. GI bleed: The patient does not have a clear inciting event
although clearly his vWD causes him to be at high risk for
bleeding.  Upon admission to the ICU, hematocrits were closely
monitored every 6 hours with a transfusion goal of HCT >25. He
was placed on a protonix drip, GI was consulted who recommended
upper and lower endoscopy, so the patient and was prepped with
Moviprep. On [**3-20**], he underwent upper endoscopy which revealed
erythema in the gastroesophageal junction compatible with mild
esophagitis but otherwise normal EGD to second part of the
duodenum. Colonoscopy showed diverticulosis of the sigmoid colon
and descending colon, grade 2 internal hemorrhoids and a
pigmented raised area noted at 40 cm in sigmoid colon. No clear
hx of tattoo from previous polypectomy site. Given bleeding
disorder and melena this site was not biopsied. Otherwise normal
colonoscopy to terminal ileum.  He underwent MRE that showed
normal small bowel. The patient received a total of 6U pRBC and
his Hct stablized at 26. He was hemodynamically stable and
transferred to the floor.  On the floor the patient Hct remained
stable and stools were guaiac negative. The patient was followed
by GI with plans for outpatient capsule endoscopy and GI
follow-up
-- patient needs an outpatient capsule endoscopy
-- repeat CBC in Hem/[**Hospital **] clinic on [**3-26**]
*** patient needs evaluation of the pigmented raised area in the
sigmoid colon. No history of tattoo and possible melenoma.

2. [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] disease: Heme/Onc team was consulted as the
patient previously had received Humate-P and IVIG during his
last admission. He was treated with IVIG x2 days and had factor
VIII, vWF antigen and cofactor levels checked.  He was closely
followed by Hem/Onc.  His bleeding stopped and remained stable.
He will have repeat labs checked on [**2195-3-26**] and follow-up in
Hem/[**Hospital **] Clinic.

3. Nosebleeds: ENT evaluated and did not see evidence of active
bleeding.  He was continued on nasal
