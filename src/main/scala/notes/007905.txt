History of Present Illness:
86 year old caucasian female with CHF, CAD, basal artery
stenosis, hiatal hernia, esophageal ulcer, MR transferred from
[**Last Name (un) 4068**]. She has history of CHF, CAD with basal artery

Ct head: IMPRESSION: No acute hemorrhage or mass effect.
Ct leg:
IMPRESSION: Large hematoma in the left calf.

ECHO [**2149-2-26**]
Conclusions:
The left atrium is dilated. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal.
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function may be more
depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.] Resting
regional wall motion
abnormalities include inferolateral hypokinesis. Estimated left
ventricular ejection fraction ?45%. Right ventricular chamber
size is normal. Right ventricular systolic function is normal.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. Mild (1+)
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The  mitral regurgitation jet is eccentric. The tricuspid valve
leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is  an anterior space which most likely
represents a fat pad, though a loculated  anterior pericardial
effusion cannot be excluded

CT chest w/o contrast [**2149-2-27**]
IMPRESSION:
1) Minimal interstitial pulmonary edema and small bilateral
pleural effusions, consistent with mild or resolving congestive
heart failure.
2) Large posterior diaphragmatic hernia of Bochdalek, which
accounts for the left-sided lucencies on previous chest
radiographs.
3) Numerous small shotty mediastinal lymph nodes, probably
reactive. .
4) 3-mm nonobstructing stone versus granuloma in the right
kidney. Multiple calcified liver and spleen granulomas.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P 86 year old with CAD, CHF, basal artery insuffiency came in
s/p fall, admitted for further evaluation of leg pain.
1) S/P mechanical fall
-CT head neg for intracranial bleed. X-rays of the pelvix and
lower extremity were negatve for fracture from OSH reports.  MRI
hip was done in the ED at [**Hospital1 18**] ED which r/o fracture.  Ct of
leg on [**2-26**] confirmed the development of a left calf hematoma

#Psych
-give haldol 1-2mg PRN for agitation, hold nortryptylline per
psych, Continue prozac
-A psych consult was called on admission due to pateint's
history of agitation/confusion and visual/auditory
hallucinations s/p recent passing of her husband.  Pt thought to
have delerium +/- depression

#CV-
Overnight from [**Date range (1) 61132**], she had an episode of hypotension
(systolic 60-70's) (pt's BP in the ED the day previously was
130/60) and received 1-2 L of fluid boluses with minimal
improvement of her hypotension; ABG w/ PO2 75. This AM,
hypotensive (MAP ~low 60's, systolic 70-80's) hypoxic again to
sats in hi 70's to lo 80's (ABG x2 were likely venous w/ PO2 29,
32) which improved with 100% NRB. Incidentally her BP improved
on the NRB as well. Hct this AM 24.7 from 28 (at [**Last Name (un) 4068**]) without
dilution of CBC or completion of blood transfusion. Levaquin and
Vanco were given to cover for possibility of infection.  Pt was
transferred to ICU for closer monitoring and managment. Cardiac
enzymes were sent which ruled in strongly for myocardial
infarction.  A CXR showed evidence of congestive heart failure
and ? LLL opacity.  A CT chest without contrast was done which
showed evidence of pulmonary edema and large posterior
diaphragmatic hernia of Bochdalek, which accounts for the
left-sided lucencies on previous chest radiographs. CT of
patient's left leg was done as this showed edema and echhymosis.
A large calf hematoma and edema was observed.  As pt had
evidence of myocardial infarction and CHF, an echo was done
which showed EF?45%, mod pul art systolic HTN, 2+MR,
infero-lateral HK.   A cardiology consult was obtained for
management of NSTEMI.  Family was clear that aggressive measures
were not to be taken and DNR/DNI status was confirmed. Medical
managment of MI was requested.  The cardiology service
recommened the following:  1) HCT > 30
2) ASA  3) Plavix once bleeding issue is resolved  4)
Metoprolol, titrate up as tolerated  5) ACE  6) Lipitor  7) Hold
off heparin given bleeding concerns.  These recommendation were
followed.

On [**2-27**], a family meeting occurred and comfort was decided to be
the primary goal of the patient's care from that point forward
given her critical status and recent  deterioration in overall
condition.  A morphine gtt was started on [**2-27**]  and the patient
expired at 9:13 am on [**2-28**].

[**Name (NI) **] pt was covered with Vanc/levofloacin out of concern for
hospital acquired pneumonia +/- sepsis given pt hypoxia and
hypotension.  Blood and urine cultures showed no growth.  No
further evidence of infection was identified. NSTEMI accounted
for HD changes/

HEME- given hematocrit drop leading to demand ischemia.
