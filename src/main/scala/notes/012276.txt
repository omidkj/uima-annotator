Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1167**]
Chief Complaint:
Acute on Chronic Diastolic congestive heart failure

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Left knee arthrocentesis
right heart catheterization

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 98957**] is a 56 year old gentleman with signficant PMH of
CAD s/p MI in [**2175**] with DES to RCA and DES to LCx, systolic CHF
with last LVEF 25-30% and multiple admissions for sCHF
exacerbations who presents as direct admission for refractory
volume overload due to sCHF.

Patient is followed closely for his sCHF by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 437**] and is
frequently seen in the CHF outpatient infusion clinic. His last
visit was on [**4-19**] where his weight was 265 (baseline 250) and he
received 80mg IV lasix and 5mg po metolazone. He says that he
has had progressive weight gain and DOE over the last several
months, but notes no acute changes within the last several
weeks. His legs are progressively becoming more edematous and he
describes them currently as 'hefty'. He has consistent 2 pillow
orthopnea and denies PND. He can walk approximately 1 block
before becoming shortness of breath. He denies any anginal or
claudication pain. He does report eating a fair amount of
'processed' foods. Notably, he was admitted [**Date range (1) 51038**] for CRF
and hyperglycemia. During this admission, he reportedly made
trips off the floor to the cafeteria, and his dietary compliance
was questionable.

On arrival to the floor, patient is ambulatory and out of bed
upon entering the room. He has no complaints except for chronic
back and knee pain and is asking for dilaudid.

RADIOLOGY:
[**2187-4-23**]   Radiology CHEST PORT. LINE PLACEM
Portable upright frontal chest radiograph demonstrates interval
placement of a left upper extremity PICC, the tip of which
projects over the upper SVC.  Multiple blebs are again noted in
the peripheral right upper lung, better seen on CT from [**2186-6-23**].  The cardiac silhouette is top normal in size, accentuated
by portable technique.  The pulmonary vasculature appears mildly
engorged.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The
mediastinal contours are normal.
IMPRESSION:
1.  Interval placement of left upper extremity PICC, the tip of
which is in the upper SVC.

2.  Interval decrease in heart size from [**2186-11-19**]; the
pulmonary
vasculature is minimally engorged.

ECHO TTE [**2187-4-24**] ON MILRINONE;

Conclusions
Poor image quality. The left atrium is moderately dilated. No
atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is
mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular cavity size is top normal/borderline dilated. There
is mild to moderate regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction with infero-septal, inferior and infero-lateral
hypokinesis suggested. There is no ventricular septal defect. RV
systolic function is difficult to assess but appear borderline
in some views. The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus
level. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal
with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic
regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation
is seen. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be
determined. There is no pericardial effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2187-2-22**],
LVEF has improved and LV systolic dysfunction now appears more
regional than

RIGHT HEART CATH [**2187-4-25**]:

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Moderate elevation of the wedge pressure consistent with
moderate
left ventricular diastolic heart failure.
2. Severe pulmonary hypertension with marked resipiratory
variation.
3. Moderately elevated pulmonary vascular resistance.
4. Normal cardiac output and index on milrinone.

PORTABLE ABD XRAY [**2187-4-27**]:
FINDINGS:  Study is limited due to the patient's extreme
obesity.  However, no signs of obstruction or ileus are noted.
The lungs show pulmonary edema and cardiomegaly. PICC line
terminates in appropriate posistion.  No obvious pleural
effusions are noted.  No free air or obstructive pattern.  Bony
structures are unremarkable.

IMPRESSION:
1.  Pulmonary edema and cardiomegaly.
2.  No evidence of obstruction or ileus.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 98957**] is a 56 year old gentleman with diabetes mellitus
(DM), coronary artery disease (CAD), and stage III systolic
heart failure (sCHF) who presented as a direct admission for
milrinone and lasix drip for refractory edema.

ACTIVE PROBLEMS:
# Refractory edema: Likely due to worsening chronic sCHF. Liver
synthetic function was intact making HCV associated cirrhosis
unlikely. Diuresis was achieved with lasix gtt augmented with
milrinone gtt as below. Weight on admission was 119.75 kgs.

# Acute on chronic systolic function: Patient with sCHF and LVEF
25-30 % in [**2187-2-18**]. Primarily has right sided symptoms at
this time given his gross peripheral edema and clear lungs on
admission. Home regimen includes torsemide 100mg daily,
spironolactone 25mg daily, carvedilol 25mg twice daily and
valsartan 40mg daily. We initially continued his carvedilol and
valsartan, but held
