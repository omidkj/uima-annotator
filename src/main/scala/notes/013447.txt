Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 165**]
Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea on exertion, fatigue, weakness

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2130-11-14**] Aortic Valve Replacement(21mm Pericardial) and Two
Vessel Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting(SVG to PDA, SVG to Ramus)


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 61 year old male with known aortic stenosis. He
has had recent development of congestive heart failure. Serial
ECHOs displayed worsening aortic stenosis and mitral
regurgitation. His most recent ECHO is from [**10-9**] which revealed
severe AS with [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Location (un) 109**] of 0.5cm2 and mean gradient of 51mmHg.
There was moderate AI, moderate MR, and mild TR. His LVEF was
estimated at 60%.
In [**2130-3-3**], he underwent cardiac catheterization which revealed
severe two vessel coronary artery disease. He underwent
successful PTCA of the RCA at that time but the circumflex
lesion PTCA was unsuccessful. The LAD had minimal disease at
that time. Given his worsening symptoms, and the severity of his
aortic stenosis, he was referred for cardiac surgical
intervention.

Social History:
Social history is significant for the remote tobacco use (in
college).  Admits to [**3-5**] scotch drinks per night. Married, lives
with wife.

or sudden death.

Pertinent Results:
[**2130-11-14**] Intraop TEE:
Pre Bypass:
The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size.
Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There
are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. There are
three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets are
severely thickened/deformed. There is severe aortic valve
stenosis (area <0.8cm2). Moderate (2+) aortic regurgitation is
seen. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The mitral
annulus, left atrium and left ventricle is normal in size. There
is no prolapse or flail segments seen in the mitral valve. There
is no pericardial effusion.
Post Bypass:
Left and right ventricular function is preserved. The aorta is
intact. An aortic valve prothesis is in good position and has a
mean gradient of 7 mmHg. There is trivial aortic regurgitation.
The is mild mitral regurgitation. The remainder of the exam is
unchanged.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was admitted and underwent an aortic valve replacment
and coronary artery bypass grafting surgery by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **].
Please see operative note for surgical details. Following the
operation, he was brought to the CVICU for invasive monitoring.
Within 24 hours, he awoke neurologically intact and was
extubated without incident. He required several units of PRBC's
to maintain hematocrit near 30%. On postoperative day two, he
was transferred to the step down unit for further recovery. He
was gently diuresed towards his preoperative weight. The
physical therapy service was consulted for assistance with his
postoperative strength and mobility.  Chest tubes and pacing
wires were discontinued without incident.  The patient developed
atrial fibrillation (of which he has a history).  He was treated
with amiodarone, beta blocker, and anticoagulation.  By the time
of discharge, the wound was healing, the patient was ambulating
with assistance and pain was controlled with oral analgesics.
He was discharged in good condition to rehab on POD 5.
