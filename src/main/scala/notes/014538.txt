Service: CARDIOTHORACIC

Allergies:
Ticlid / Morphine / Percocet / Codeine

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1505**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2146-7-27**]
1. Aortic valve replacement with a 25-mm Biocor Epic tissue
    heart valve.
2. Mitral valve repair with a mitral valve annuloplasty
    with a 30-mm [**Doctor Last Name 405**] band.
3. Coronary artery bypass grafting x2; with left internal
    mammary artery graft to left anterior descending, and
    lesser saphenous vein graft to the posterior descending
    artery.


History of Present Illness:
73M w/ hx of critical AS, CAD, PAD and recent NSTEMI with CHF
exacerbation last week ([**2146-7-10**] - [**2146-7-13**]) discharged on medical
management now returns with complaint of increased SOB. He
reports doing well for the first few days after discharge,
however he began to experience significant SOB and fatigue with
minimal activity. He reports eating Italian sausages and fast
food yesterday prior to the development of these symptoms during
the day. When going to bed last night, he had difficulty
sleeping due to SOB and had to sit up to catch his breath. He
ended up spending much of the night sitting up in a chair. At
the urging of his wife, he came to the [**Name (NI) **] today for further
evaluation and management.

On arrival to the [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] EKG was performed which noted the
presence of LBBB. This is a stable finding in this patient,
however a code STEMI was called and he was rushed to the cath
lab. On arrival to the cath lab, his EKG was again reviewed and
the stable LBBB was noted. He therefore did not undergo
catheterization. He is now sent to the floor for a presumed CHF
exacerbation and probable consultation with cardiac surgery for
expedition of his planned AVR and CABG. He denies any associated
chest pain, nausea, vomiting, abdominal discomfort, increased
edema, headache, fevers, vision changes, or other comlaints.

Comparison is made with prior study, [**7-10**].

Mild-to-moderate cardiomegaly is stable.  There has been
improvement in now
mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema.  There is no pneumothorax or
enlarging
pleural effusions.

[**2146-7-26**] EKG:
Atrial fibrillation with a controlled ventricular response. Left

Conclusions
PRE-CPB:
The left atrium is markedly dilated. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler.

There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The
left ventricular cavity size is normal. There is mild global
left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 45 %). The right
ventricular cavity is moderately dilated with normal free wall
contractility.

There are simple atheroma in the ascending aorta. There are
simple atheroma in the aortic arch. There are simple atheroma in
the descending thoracic aorta. No thoracic aortic dissection is
seen. There are three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve
leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. There is critical
aortic valve stenosis (valve area <0.8cm2). Trace aortic
regurgitation is seen.

The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The mitral valve
leaflets do not fully coapt. Severe (4+) central mitral
regurgitation is seen.

Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified of findings at time of study.

POST-CPB:
There is a bioprosthetic valve in the aortic position. The valve
is well seated with normally mobile leaflets. There are no
apparent paravalvular leaks. There is no AI. The peak gradient
across the aortic valve is 14mmHg, the mean gradient is 6mmHg.

A mitral annuloplasty ring is seen, consistent with mitral valve
repair. There is no residual mitral regurgitation.

The left ventricular systolic function remains mildly depressed,
estimated EF=45%. The right ventricular systolic function is
preserved.

Other valvular function is unchanged.

There is no evidence of dissection.
  I certify that I was present for this procedure in compliance
with HCFA regulations.
