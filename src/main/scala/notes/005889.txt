Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2751**]
Chief Complaint:
tachypnea, hypotension, respiratory distress


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Tracheal intubation


History of Present Illness:
45 M w metastatic RCC (papillary vs clear cell) to lungs & L
pleural effusions s/p multiple chemo regimens (most recently
cycle 10 of bevacizumab + erlotinib on [**2158-4-13**]), presents after
a recent admission to [**Hospital1 18**] for PNA with fevers, tachypnea,
cough, SOB.
.
The patient was most recently admitted from [**2158-4-10**] to [**2158-4-14**]
for similar symptoms.  He was started on a 14-day course of
unasyn & doxycycline but was ultimately discharged on augmentin.
 He did not, however, complete a 14-day course; opting to stop
antibiotics on [**4-18**] in hopes of being considered for a clinical
trial.
.
Subsequent to his penultimate admission, he was screened for a
clinical trial for a novel anti-PDL1 antibody that required him
to hold his tarceva for 3 weeks. During this time, he appears
to have clinically deteriorated.  His current symptoms include
dyspnea on exertion, chills, night sweats, extremely poor PO
intake.  He notes that he woke from sleep two days earlier
gasping for breath.  During this time, his friends have been
giving him IVF fluids.  Yesterday, he was set up with 5L home
oxygen by face mask and he states that he has been sleeping
comfortably.
.
The patient also reports several days of crampy abdominal pain &
diarrhea.
.
Today, the patient presented to heme/onc clinic for a follow up
appointment with shaking chills and fevers.  His oxygen
saturation was noted to be 89% on RA.  He was started on 5L
oxygen via FM and his oxygen subsequently rose to 97%.  BP was
noted to be 81/39 with HR 117, temp 100.6.  He denied dizziness
and lightheadedness.  he was given 1 L NS but his BP persisted
in the 80s/40s.  Given his clinical picture he was referred to
the ED for further evaluation.
.
In the ED, the patient was given a total of 4L of IVF.  He was
given 125 mg PO vanco, 500 mg IV flagyl, 750 mg IV levofloxacin.
 He had a CXR and CT that showed enlarged pleural effusion on
the left.  As such, IP was called and a thoracentesis was
performed.  250 cc of serous fluid was drained.
.
Vital signs at the time of transfer: 97.4  108  99/56  27  94/RA
.
On arrival to the ICU, the patient states that he is thirsty but
that his breathing has improved dramatically.
.

IMAGING:
CXR [**5-10**]: Increasing opacity in the left lower lung, concerning
for
worsening consolidation and effusion. Extensive metastatic
disease within the chest. Refer to subsequent CT for further
details.

CTA Chest/Abd/Pelvis [**5-10**]:
1. Extensive metastatic disease within the chest, including
mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy and extensive pulmonary
nodularity and both hilar and perihilar consolidations.
Increased consolidations in the left lower lobe, lingula and
right lower lobe likely account for acute symptoms of tachypnea.
 Slight increase in left loculated pleural effusion and interval
development of a small right pleural effusion.
2. Metastatic disease burden in the abdomen appears overall
stable with
retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy. Small volume ascites is new
from prior exam with mild bowel wall thickening along the distal
colon, likely indicative of colitis (inflammatory versus
infectious, versus ischemic).
3. No central PE identified.

CXR [**5-12**]: Tip of the new left PIC line projects over the low
SVC.
Severe consolidation in most of the left lower lung and in a
smaller region of the right lower lung has improved slightly on
the left, worsened slightly on the right. Previous pulmonary
edema has improved. Extensive pleural mass surrounds the left
lung and small pleural effusion and is collected in a
nondependent fashion, probably unchanged in overall volume since
the earlier study. Small right pleural effusion layers
dependently. Heart size is normal, but mediastinal contours and
the enlarged left hilum reflect extensive central lymph node
enlargement.
