History of Present Illness:
66M with CAD s/p CABG, VF arrest s/p AICD, ischemic CMP (LVEF
20-25%), AF/flutter s/p ablation admitted with symptomatic
hypotension. Of note the pt was admitted from [**4-24**] through [**5-3**]
to [**Hospital1 1516**] for progressively worsening shortness of breath and
weight gain and found to have an acute systolic CHF
exacerbation. During the admission the pt denied chest pain,
Trop 0.14, CK-MB was 3, and EKG revealed non-specific findings.
BNP 2218. CXR with pulmonary edema. No clear preciptant was
identified though it was likely due dietary indiscretion and med
non-compliance. Pt was diuresed with lasix gtt and once daily
dosing of Diuril. Of note wt on admission was 221.7 lbs and was
diuresed to a wt of 178.2lbs (43.6 lbs change, below his dry
weight). On d/c Cr had increased from 1.1 to 2. The pt was
discharged on lasix 80mg [**Hospital1 **]. The pt was discharged yesterday.

Today the pt was seen by his VNA to whom he reported feeling
very lightheaded and tired. His BP was 60/30. He drank water and
repeat pressure with 72/40. She recommended he go to the ED and
he refused.
The VNA rechecked readings 60/30 sitting and 50/30 standing.
Patient got home last night. Also of note the pt had not filled
his bactrim or dabigitran. The pt's PCP then called the pt and
spoke to his granddaughter and instructed her to bring him to
the ED.

the 80s, starting to feeling better. 100% on 2L. Lactate. UA
negative. CXR clear. Little lightheadedness. ECG stable. Vitals
prior to transfer Afebrile, 90/48 7616 97%2:.

On arrival to the CCU (MICU 7 border) the pt denies
lightheadedness, chest pain, shortness of breath.

On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. S/he denies recent fevers, chills or

other review of systems were negative.

chest pain, -dyspnea on exertion, -paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea,
+orthopnea, +ankle edema, -palpitations, -syncope or
+presyncope.

PORTABLE UPRIGHT AP VIEW OF THE CHEST: A right-sided pacemaker
device is
noted with lead terminating in the right ventricle. Abandoned
left-sided
pacer leads are also noted. The patient is status post median
sternotomy and CABG. Mild cardiomegaly persists. The mediastinal
and hilar contours are stable. Pulmonary vascular congestion is
present without pleural effusions or pneumothorax. No focal
consolidation is present. There are no acute osseous findings.


Brief Hospital Course:
66 year old male with CAD s/p CABG, VF arrest s/p AICD, ischemic
CMP (EF 20-25%), AF/flutter s/p ablation with recent admission
for acute systolic CHF with aggressive diuresis admitted with
hypotension and [**Last Name (un) **].

1. Hypotension due to hypovolemia due to overdiuresis.  Patient
was noted to be hypotensive at home by visiting RN. Admitted to
CCU. Hypotension resolved with one unit of PRBC and 500 cc of NS
bolus.  Subsequently blood pressure remained stable throughout
hospital course.

BID held on admission. Continued on metoprolol succinate 50 mg
po qdaily. Lisinopril 5 mg po qdaily held due to [**Last Name (un) **]. Was given
IV lasix 60 mg x 1 early morning of [**2122-5-6**] and = restarted
home lasix 120 mg po BID evening of [**2122-5-6**]. Pt was discharged
on above regimen with plans to follow up wtih cardiology
regarding the initiation of lisinopril.

3. Complicated Urinary Tract Infection: Urine analysis was
normal. Urine culture showed no growth. Bactrim was discontinued
due to [**Last Name (un) **] and did not require any antibiotics as patient was
asymptomatic.

4. CAD s/p 4V CABG: Currently chest pain free. ECG unchanged.
Cardiac enzymes negative.  Continued on atorvastatin 40 mg PO
daily.  Metoprolol succinate 50 mg po qdaily changed to
metoprolol tartrate 25 mg po BID.  Lisinopril 5 mg po qdaily
held due to [**Last Name (un) **].  He was continued on aspirin 81 mg po qdaily.

5. Atrial Fibrillation/Flutter s/p Ablation: Currently with good
HR control on metoprolol 25 mg po BID. Anticoagulated with
dabigatran which was held on admission. Restarted dabigatran at
75 mg po BID on [**2122-5-6**].

6. Hypovolemic Hyponatremia: Resolved with volume repletion.

7. IDDM: A1c 7.6% on [**2122-4-10**]. FSG currently in mid-100s.
Continue home dose Lantus 30 units QAM.  Continue Pregabalin 75
