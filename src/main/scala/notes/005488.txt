shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:

History of Present Illness:
53 yo F with diastolic CHF, CAD, DM, Hep C, presents with
progressive dyspnea on exertion and chest pain.  The patient has
been having progressive dyspnea over the past 3-4 weeks.  The
symptoms are worsened by even mild activity such as sweeping the
floor.  She also has been having intermittent L chest pain with
out radiation or diaphoresis.  This pain worsens with activity
and improves with rest.  Furthermore the patient has been having
a productive cough with brown sputum.  Patient is a difficult
historian.
.
Denies fevers, chills, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea.  Reports no
change in her chronic abdominal pain or chronic orthopnea.
Patient speaks slowly with a flat affect.
.
In the ED patient was given 60mg IV lasix, levoflox 500mg IV.

Agree with Nightfloat admission note. The patient is not able to
provide a fully consistent history. She mentions feeling more
ill over the past several weeks, which has included increased
SOB as well as intermittent chest pain. She believes the CP
radiates to both arms is described as sharp rather than
sqeezing. She has noted increased SOB when performing her daily
activities, she is highly sedentery recently, no stairs or walks
outside of the home. She is currently chest pain free. No
fevers, chills, no cough or wheezing.

[**2101-5-5**] ECHO
1. The left atrium is moderately dilated. The left atrium is
elongated.
2. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. The left ventricular cavity
is unusually small. Left ventricular cavity size could not be
determined. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF>55%). [Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is
likely more depressed given the severity of valvular
regurgitation.]
3. Right ventricular chamber size is normal. Right ventricular
systolic
function is normal. Abnormal septal position consistent with RV

pressure/volume overload.
4. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+)
aortic
regurgitation is seen.
5.The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is
moderate mitral stenosis. Mild to moderate ([**1-17**]+) mitral
regurgitation is seen.
6. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
7.There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
8.There is no pericardial effusion

[**2101-5-6**] Stress Test
This 53 year old type 2 IDDM woman was referred to
the lab for evaluation of chest discomfort and shortness of
breath. Due
to PVD, the patient was infused with 0.142 mg/kg/min of
dipyridamole
over 4 minutes. No arm, neck, back or chest discomfort was
reported by
the patient throughout the study. There were no ST segment
changes
during the infusion or in recovery. The rhythm was sinus with
frequent
isolated vpbs. Appropriate hemodynamc response to the infusion.
The
dipyridamole was reversed with 125 mg of aminophylline IV.
IMPRESSION: No anginal type symptoms or ischemic EKG changes.
Nuclear
report sent separately.

[**2101-5-9**] Cardiac Catheterization
1. Selective coronary angiography showed a co-dominanat system
with
calcified Left Main Coronary Artery. The LAD had a 50%
mid-vessel hazy
lesion. LCX had a severe 90% lesion at its origin and a 50% OM
lesion.
RCA was chronically totally occluded proximally but was a
smaller vessel
with an acute marginal branch and modest L->R collaterals.
2. Left ventriculography showed preserved ejection fraction
(58%) which
is depressed given the degree of mitral regurgitation (3+).
Inferior
wall was hypokinetic.
3. Hemodynamic assessment showed a 9 mmhg gradient across the
mitral
valve consistent with moderate mitral stenosis. There was no
gradient
across the aortic valve. Pulmonary pressures were moderately to
severely
elevated with Pap 85/38. PCWP was 35 mm Hg.

[**2101-5-14**] CXR
Right internal jugular vascular sheath remains in standard
position. There is stable [**Month/Day/Year **] widening of the cardiac
and mediastinal contours. Vascular engorgement and perihilar
haziness is again demonstrated. Bibasilar atelectasis and
pleural effusions, small on the left and moderate on the right
are without change. Overall, there has not been a significant
change allowing for technical differences.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 39008**] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2101-5-5**] for evaluation
of chest discomfort and dyspnea. A stress test was performed
which was normal however the nuclear images revealed a
reversible defect in the left anterior descending artery
territory. Plavix was started and her lipitor was increased.
Lasix and an ace inhibitor were started for congestive heart
failure symptoms. She developed another episode of chest pain
which suggested the possibility of unstable angina. A cardiac
catheterization was performed which was significant for three
vessel coronary artery disease, mixed mitral valve stenosis and
regurgitation and left ventricular ejection fraction of 58%. An
echocardiogram was performed which showed a dilated left atrium,
a normal left ventricular ejection fraction, 1+ aortic
regurgitation, moderate mitral valve stenosis, moderate mitral
valve regurgitation and moderate pulmonary hypertension. Heparin
was started and her plavix was stopped. Given these findings,
the cardiac surgery service was consulted for surgical
evaluation. Mrs. [**Known lastname 39008**] was worked-up in the usual preoperative
manner. On [**2101-5-12**], Mrs. [**Known lastname 39008**] was taken to the operating room
