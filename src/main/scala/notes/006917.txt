Attending:[**Name (NI) 9308**]
Chief Complaint:
shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Pericardiocentesis
Pericardial Window
Thoracostomy


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 5057**] is 77M with h/o HTN, HLD, COPD, and newly diagnosed
NSCLC c/b pericardial effusion wtih tamponade s/p
pericardiocentesis in [**8-/2132**] and s/p one round of
taxol/carboplatin chemotherapy, recent new heart failure
diagnosed in [**9-/2132**] (EF 40-45%), who is presenting with
worsening SOB and DOE for the last few days.  As per the
patient's wife, the patient has been having worsening dyspnea on
exertion for the last few days, that acutely worsened earlier
today when he was walking up the stairs.  In addition, also
reports having worsening orthopnea over the last few days as
well (he usually uses one pillow at night, but reports that for
the last few days he has been using two pillows).  Pt also
reports decreased PO intake for the last few days.

Denies any chest pain, no anginal like symptoms, denies any
increasing swelling in legs.  Denies any wheezing, reports that
this shortness of breath does not feel like his COPD.  Denies
increasing use of his nebs.  He uses 2L NC at home at his
baseline.
..
Of note, the patient was admitted to CCU at the end of [**Month (only) 216**]
for pericardial effusion with e/o tamponade physiology s/p
pericardiocentesis taking out ~1L of bloody fluid, malignant
cells found on cytology.  The patient was also found to have new
heart failure in [**9-/2132**], with EF 40-45% (previous ECHOs with EF
>55%).  Was thought that his heart dysfunction could be
secondary to mid LAD ischemia, with suggestion of cardiac cath.
..
Denies any chest pain, shortness of breath, recent
fevers/chills, coughing.  Does report having L shoulder and arm
pain yesterday, that self resolved in 20 minutes; reports having
this pain in the past, but usually responds to Tylenol.  Does
not report any associated diaphoresis, chest pain.  Denies any
n/v, abdominal pain, no changes in his BMs, no numbness or
tingling, no headache, no changes in vision, no night sweats.
..
On initial evaluation in the ED, the patient was in respiratory
distress, breathing at a rate of 30 and was triggered for
hypoxia.  Was started on NRB at 10-15L, satting mid 90s.
..
EKG in ED showing RBBB, no STE, mild depression V4-6, HR 106,
NSR.  There was question of irregular rhythm while patient en
route to ED, but has been in NSR since he has been here.
D-dimer elevated to 19,998 and BNP 8510.  Trop 0.55, creat 1.9.
Heparin drip was started out of concern for PE; no CTA done
because of ARF.  A bedside ECHO showed no recurrence of
pericardial effusion.  Pt was admitted to CCU for possible cath
out of concern for latent LAD thrombosis.
..
On transfer to CCU, patient satting 100% on 3L NC, with HR in
low 100s, breathing at 20-22.
