Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 663**]
Chief Complaint:
intertrochanteric femur fracture status-post fall

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
-Open reduction internal fixation of left hip [**2140-2-1**]
-Intubation


History of Present Illness:
 Ms [**Known lastname 24834**] is an 88yo with a history of HTN, diastolic CHF,
aortic stenosis (valve area .8-1cm), osteoporosis and afib not
on anticoagulation now presenting after landing on her left side
after a fall.  She was in a [**Doctor Last Name **] about to get out to go to church
when the [**Doctor Last Name **] continued to roll a few inches while she was
standing inside causing her to fall on to her left side.  She
says this was purely mechanical and denied any preceding
prodrome of dizziness, chest pain, sob, or palpitations.  She
denied loss of conciousness.  She notes the pain was immediate
and [**10-3**].  At no point does she recall losing sensation in her
left leg/foot, and does have motor function which is limited
from pain.
.
In the ED, initial vs were: 98.5, 63, 103/87, 18, 97% RA. EKG
unchanged from prior.  Patient was given 6mg IV morphine for
pain control. Radiographs of her, L elbow, shoulder, hip and
knee were obtained, demonstrating a minimally displaced
intertrochanteric L femur fracture.  Ortho saw the pt and say
she will need surgical repair but would like her medically
optimized before this.
.
On the floor,  VS were: T: 97.1  BP: 122/70  HR: 56  RR: 16  O2
95% RA
She reports being in [**10-3**] pain currently but does not look
visibly distressed

STUDIES:
.
Left hip xray [**1-31**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. Left minimally displaced intertrochanteric femoral fracture.
2. Possible irregularity at the left tibial plateau, for which
dedicated knee radiographs should be performed.
3. Vascular calcifications.
.
Shoulder/elbow xray [**1-31**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. Minimal shoulder degenerative changes with unchanged calcific
tendinitits.
2. Possible small left elbow joint effusion, although no
fracture is
definitely identified.
.
EKG [**1-31**]:
Sinus bradycardia with A-V conduction delay. Intra-atrial
conduction delay. Probable left ventricular hypertrophy. Lateral
lead ST-T wave abnormalities with borderline [**Month/Day (4) 5937**] interval may be
due to left ventricular hypertrophy but clinical correlation is
suggested. Since the previous tracing of [**2138-7-23**] there is
probably no significant change.
.
Post-op hip xray [**2-1**]:
FINDINGS AND IMPRESSION: Multiple intraoperative fluoroscopic
images of the left hip. Status post ORIF of the left hip with
short intramedullary nail and hip screw. The hardware appears
intact. Improved alignment of the
intertrochanteric fracture. No definite dislocation. Total
intraoperative
fluoroscopic imaging time 119.1 seconds. Please see operative
report for
further details.


Brief Hospital Course:
88 yo female with PMH of CAD, CHF, PAF, AS, presenting s/p
mechanical fall with subsequent left intertroch fracture s/p
ORIF, transferred back to medicine for management of medical
issues.
.
# Left hip fracture s/p ORIF:  The description of the fall seems
to be mechanical as there was no preceding prodrome to suggest
syncope and no loss of conciousness or cardiac symptoms to
suggest arrhythmia.  Left femur XR in the ED showed
intertrochanteric fracture.  Pt was admitted to medicine prior
to surgical repair given her comorbidities of a.fib, CHF, and
severe AS.  She was deemd high-risk for surgery, but given the
high morbidity/mortality from immobility of an unrepaired hip
fracture, the decision was made to procede to ORIF.  On [**2-1**] she
underwent open reduction internal fixation of her left femur
fracture.  She tolerated the procedure and anesthesia well
without intraoperative complication.  After the procedure she
remained intubated and was monitored in the ICU as prophylaxis
due to concern of possible flash pulmonary edema due to
interoperative fluids.  At 11pm on [**2-1**], she was extubated and
she was transfered back to the medical floor on [**2-2**].   She
received routine post op care and pain was controlled with
standing tylenol and IV morphine which was eventually weaned to
a PO regimen, and eventually just standing tylenol.  She was
started on lovenox 30mg SC daily which should be continued for 1
month.  She worked with PT and progressed quite well and this
should be continued at rehab.
.
#Hct drop:  Pt with steady Hct drop from 38.1 on admission to
25.7 on discharge.  No sign of bleed and surgical site does not
appear to have hematoma.  We recommend trending this at rehab
until it stabilizes.
.
# A fib:  Pt with history of PAF, rhythm controlled on
amiodarone.  Of note, she has not anticoagulated given history
of GIB.  She was continued on home amiodarone as well as asa-81
and remained in NSR throughout admission
.
# Severe AS:  Pt with sever AS, valve area 0.8-1.0 cm2 and
aortic valve gradient 56 mmhg on Echo in 4/[**2138**].
Symptomatically she denied any CP or SOB, however does have
persistent fatigue which has been her baseline.  Given her
severe AS she is preload dependent and BPs were closel
