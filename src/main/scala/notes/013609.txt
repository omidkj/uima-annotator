**FINAL REPORT [**2113-1-3**]**
   URINE CULTURE (Final [**2113-1-3**]):    NO GROWTH.

=============
Radiology
=============
CT Head [**1-2**]
1. Mucosal thickening of the left maxillary and ethmoid sinuses
with an
air-fluid level in the left maxillary sinus.
2. No acute bleed or masses present.

=============
Cardiology
=============
[**1-5**] Echo
Suboptimal image quality. Overall left ventricular systolic
function cannot be reliably assessed (it does appear depressed
in certain views with possible infero-lateral hypokinesis).
There is abnormal septal motion/position. The diameters of aorta
at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. Trivial
mitral regurgitation is seen. Tricuspid regurgitation is present
but cannot be quantified. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure
could not be determined. There is no pericardial effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2112-1-18**], no
definite change. If indicated, a repeat study with echo contrast
(Definity) may assist in assessment of LV function.

Brief Hospital Course:
63 yo M with  bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, rheumatoid
arthritis, COPD, CHF, diabetes mellitus, peripheral vascular
disease, hypertension, CKD and questionable pulmonary embolism
admitted for syncope now s/p MICU for for acute on chronic
respiratory acidosis.
.
# Hypercarbic respiratory failure: Unrespeonsive upon arrival on
the floor. Likely related to a h/o sleep apnea and hx of COPD,
however no PFTs on record.  Minimal emphysema on CT scan, but
exam consistent with COPD given wheezing, pursed lip [**Year (4 digits) 4605**],
decreased breath sounds. Started treatment for COPD flare.
Patient also underwent a sleep study in house which showed
Cheynes-[**Doctor Last Name **] [**Doctor Last Name 4605**] pattern, with intermittent
desaturation. The recommendation was night time oxygen and slide
sleeping. Had an echo that was a poor quality but systolic CHF
was not thought to be a significant contributor. Continued
albuterol, ipratropium, advair in house but resumed home
inhalers prior to discharge. Continuous O2 sats, titrate to O2
sats to range 88-92% given chronic CO2 retention.  Encouraged
incentive spirometry. Resumed 10mg PO lasix per home regimen.
Patient should have outpatient PFTS.
.
# Somnolence: Most likely due to CO2 retention in the setting of
obesity hypoventilation/COPD.  Pt showed significant improvement
with initiation of BiPAP.
Mental status cleared in the morning with Bipap and did not
require Respiratory support for the rest of the day. TSH, Utox,
LFTs normal. CT head was negative. On HD#2, BiPAP trial while
patient somnolent and after BiPAP x 1 hour ABG 7.23 / 89 / 90.
Switched to nasal CPAP x 10-15 minutes ABG 7.27 / 78 / 51.
Thought to be multifactorial in the setting of renal failure,
uremia and hypercarbia. Confirmed with pharmacy that psych meds
are hepatically cleared, so unlikely to have worsen
