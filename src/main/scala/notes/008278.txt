Brief Hospital Course:
# Upper GI bleed: Patient presented after two significant
episodes of hemoptysis and was initially admitted to the medical
ICU. He received a total of 6 units of pRBC during his ICU stay
and his Hct stabilized ~28. He was kept on 8mg/hr pantoprazole
drip, then transferred to 40 mg IV BID. His extensive home blood
pressure medications including metolazone, metoprolol,
torsemide, warfarin, aspirin, and ramipril were held. He was
given erythromycin and an emergent EGD was performed in the ICU
which showed erosive gastritis and duodenitis but no active
bleeding. He had no further episodes of hematemesis or
hemoptysis, with stable vital signs, and so was transferred to
the medical floor. There, his Hct remained stable and he did not
require any more transfusions. He was found to be positive for
H. pylori and discharged with a 14 day dose of triple therapy
with amoxicillin, clarithromycin, and omeprazole (the last of
which he will continue).
.
# Pulmonary hypertension: His medications Ambrisentan and
Sildenafil were initially held while his active GIB was managed.
He was restarted on sidenafil at his home dose upon transfer to
the floor. Patient has a chronic 3.5 L home oxygen at baseline
but did not require more than 2L oxygen during this
hospitalization with oxygen saturation >95%. On discharge,
ambrisentan was discontinued after extensive discussion between
his outpatient cardiologist, primary care physician, [**Name10 (NameIs) **]
inpatient geriatrics attending.
.
# Hypertension/Cor Pulmonale: His medications including
including metolazone, metoprolol, torsemide, and ramipril were
initially held in the context of his GIB. His blood pressure
remained stable, ranging from 90-110/65-75, with HR ranging
80-90s. This raised the question of whether patient needs his
extensive medication regimen at baseline. After extensive
discussion with his outpatient cardiologist, primary care
physician, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] inpatient geriatrics attending, the decision was
made to discharge him without his hypertensive medications. His
primary care physician agreed to manage his hypertensive
medications as an outpatient and followup appointment was made
for 3 days after discharge.
.
# Benign prostatic hyperplasia: Initially, Tamsulosin was held
for his acute GIB. It was restarted after patient was
transferred to the medical floor. In the contect of his lowish
blood pressure, the Geriatric attending decided, after
consultation with patient's primary care physician, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] stop this
medication.
.
