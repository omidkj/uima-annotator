2 day h/o increased chest tightness, wheezing, and SOB similar
to symptoms from previous asthma exacerbations. Pt states that
at baseline, her asthma is poorly-controlled, and she uses her
albuterol inhaler 5-6 times/day even when she is not
experiencing a flare with a normal peak flow around 500. Her
last flare was 2 wks ago, when she was hospitalized in the MICU
at [**Hospital1 756**]. Three wks prior to that, she was hospitalized for
asthma flare 3 wks for similar Sx. Pt had been on oral
prednisone 40 mg daily x 5 weeks from mid [**Month (only) 547**] to mid [**Month (only) 116**] but
has not taken any since. Over the last 2 days, she has been
using her nebulizers q10-15 minutes without improvement. Pt has
not been able to determine any particular trigger(s) for her
asthma flares. On ROS, pt denies URI Sx, T100 yesterday with
chills but no fever since, +cough nonproductive c/w her asthma,
+bilateral rib and abd pain secondary to coughing. Denies GERD
Sx. Has air conditioning at home, no pets, no shag carpets. Two

Brief Hospital Course:
ASTHMA - Pt came in with severe asthma flare with unclear
precipitant.  [**Month (only) 116**] not be the case, but did find out from family
memebrs that pt lives around smokers and may actually [**Month (only) **]
herself from time to time.  This was not corroborated with pt
however.  No CXR or PE findings to suggest PNA, so we held
Doxycycline or other antibiotics.  Considered infections such as
PCP given chronic steroid tapers, but again, nL sats, no fever,
and no infectious sxs(plus clear CXR) make this unlikely.  Pt
was essentially on continuous nebs overnight in ICU.  Once she
improved, she was trasferred to floor on q3-4 hour
nebs(Duonebs). Pt on Solumedrol 80 IV q8h in the ICU. She was
changed to PO Prednisone at 80 mg qday on the floor. Also
restarted outpatient Advair, Singulair.  She continued  to have
very poor air mov't and wheezing, although she said she was
basically at her baseline.  Her O2 sats remained 98-100% on RA
throughout.  Peak flows were initially ~250.  We added cromolyn
to her regimen.  After several days of this treatment, she was
feeling better, breathing more comfortably, and her PF had gone
to 500.  She was discharged home with a prednisone taper over 2
weeks.  She also wishes to transfer her care here, so she was
set-up with Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **] in 2 weeks and an appointment for PFTs.
She was also told to avoid triggers such as [**Last Name (STitle) **].
[**Hospital1 112**] records were obtained as well which showed a recent
admission for very similar symptoms and confirmed that she is
able to perform PFs of 500 when she is stable for discharge.
.
ANEMIA - Pt has an unclear baseline Hct.  She was in 35-38 range
during admission.  This could be explained bu menstruation in a
young female.  She is on iron supplements, and these were
continued.  Fe studies were sent which did show Fe of 20 and
ferritin of 18.  Given this, c/w Fe def, these were continued.
In addition, B12 was checked and was borderline low at 242.  She
was started on B12 1000 mcg qday.  This will be continued and
duration of therpay can be determined by her PCP Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **].  She
doesn't seem to be symptomatic from this Hct.
.
HEADACHE:Pt had a severe headache while here that waxed and
waned.  It seemed to coincide with nebs per pt, and possibly
with high dose steroids as well.  Neuro exam remained stable,
although she did c/o blurry vision on and off.  This did not
respond well to multiple different pain killers.  No signs of
meningitis.  This gradually faded while she was here.  Pt later
reports a FH of migraines, and fact that she has been having
headaches on and off for some time.  Believe could be migraine v
tension HA v viral illness that may have actually caused asthma
to flare in the first place.
.
NAUSEA:Pt also had [**Month (only) **] appetite and nausea while here. Resolved
by D/C.  Again, could be due to viral illness.  She reports that
she always gets nauseous with her HAs also.  Could support dx of
migraine.  No obvious BP elevation with nebs to explain above
HA.  She was eating well by D/C.
.
Sent out on her previous meds, plus Cromolyn, B12, and
prednisone taper.  She will f.u with Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **], and will need to
establish care with a pulmonologist as well in the near future.
Told to call or return if she has worsening SOB/wheezing not
controlled by meds.
