History of Present Illness:
 Pt is 42 yo m with h/o anoxic brain injury in [**2107**], who p/w L
ear pain/swelling. [**Name (NI) 1094**] mother reports that pt has had breathing
problems the past 3 weeks, and has had L ear pain/swelling for
months. He has been treated with several course of prednisone,
per mother. [**Name (NI) **] pt's mother, pt has had fevers and cold sweats
"off and on" for months. She says she is currently "being
investigated" because hospitals are "making her look like the
bad one." She insists that her son "is sick and has an
infection" and was not treated appropriately at [**Hospital1 **]
recently.
.
In the [**Name (NI) **], pt was found to be tachypnic and had labored
breathing. Because of wheezing on exam, he was given
Alb/atrovent nebs and Solumedrol 40mg IV. He was tried on BiPAP,
however his ABG was 7.23/81/162, and he was becoming more
somnolent. He was then given Propofol and intubated for
hypercarbic resp failure. He was given Clinda IV and Levoflox IV
because of small dental abscesses seen on neck CT.


Past Medical History:
- Anoxic Brain Injury: complicated by cortical vision loss,
seizures, cognitive dysfunction, myoclonus (prolonged [**Hospital1 112**]
admission in [**2107**] after presumed drug overdose per reports),
followed by behavioral neurology
- Type 2 Diabetes: Previously followed by [**Last Name (un) **] (last visit
note dated [**2109-11-4**]) with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]. Had been on insulin, now

injury
- Chronic low back pain

Neck CT w/contrast
IMPRESSION:
1. Periapical lucency involving the right maxillary second molar
([**Doctor First Name **] tooth #2), with thickening of the suprajacent buccal soft
tissues. Findings may represent a periapical abscess with
gingivitis and soft tissue extension.
2. No associated fluid collection to suggest soft tissue
abscess.
3. Mucosal thickening within the right frontal and maxillary
sinuses, likely chronic inflammatory in etiology.
.
Admission CXR: Patchy retrocardiac airspace opacity concerning
for evolving pneumonia or aspiration.
.
[**2111-2-24**]
SINGLE AP SUPINE CHEST RADIOGRAPH: Exam is limited by
respiratory motion. A left retrocardiac opacity persists and may
represent pneumonia or atelectasis. No CHF or pleural effusions.
ET tube is in unchanged position. NG tube descends below the
diaphragm, however the tip is not seen due to motion artifact
over the abdomen. Old left rib fracture is noted.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of CHF. Equivocal left lower lobe
pneumonia. Exam is limited by respiratory motion.
.
Panorex
IMPRESSION:
Suboptimal evaluation due to technique precludes evaluation of
the mandibular or maxillary alveolus. Recommend dedicated dental
radiographs if there is a particular area of concern.

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 42 yo m with h/o anoxic brain injury, p/w hypercarbic
resp failure and possible small dental abscesses.  The patient
was admitted to the ICU and the following issues were addressed:
.
1. Hypercarbic resp failure: Likely initial insult of decreased
resp drive due to narcotics/benzos. Initially placed on
Vanco/Levo/Clinda in Emergency Department for concern for sepsis
(re: PNA) in setting of hypercarbia and hypotension. Chest Xray
without signs of pneumonia. Hypotension resolved quickly. Likely
has component of chronic CO2 retention as well. Was extubated
the day after admission and initially very agitated thought to
be secondary to benzo withdrawl vs. baseline poor mental status.
Psychiatry was consulted for assistance with patient's extensive
medication list. He was initially placed on IV valium and haldol
instead of his home regimen of Klonopin and seroquel as patient
was combative and refusing to take po medications. Patient
became calm and cooperative with the medication regimen and was
switched back to all home meds with the exception of decreased
narcotics (placed on low dose fentanyl patch) and [**12-23**] klonopin
dose. Both adjustments were made re: concerns of respiratory
depression on presentation. Patient was at baseline mental
status per his sister at the time of transfer to the floor.  His
home medications were continued home medications although with
decreased Klonopin dose from 1 tid to 0.5 tid and changed paxil
to lexapro  (home meds: seroquel, baclofen, klonopin, paxil).
He was started on a low dose fentanyl patch which was titrated
upwards as needed for pain control.
.
2. L ear/facial pain: Likely secondary to right sided dental
abscesses seen on neck CT. Possibly due to poor oral hygeine in
setting of diabetes. Has been chronic infection per pt's mother.
Initially on vanc/levo/clinda in ED, changed to augmentin and
completed an 8 day course.  Dental was consulted after panorex
was ob
