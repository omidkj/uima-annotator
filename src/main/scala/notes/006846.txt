History of Present Illness:
 89-year-old female with past medical history of atrial
flutter on coumadin presents after being found unresponsive on
the ground.  She was recently admitted on [**2121-6-10**] after a fall
without any loss of consciousness; during that admission, she
was
cardioverted and placed on amiodarone and discharged to rehab.
She returned home from rehab on [**2121-6-30**].  Her family last talked
to her last night around 10 PM and she did not have any
difficulty understanding or producing speech.  She was found
this
morning by her neighbor [**Name (NI) 14878**] and she was unresponsive.

She was brought to the ED where CT demonstrated a large right
temporo-occipital intraparenchymal, intraventricular, subdural,
and subarachnoid hemorrhage with 16mm R-->L midline shift, and a
left occipito-parietal subarachnoid hemorrhage.  She was
intubated with propofol sedation.  INR was 1.9, so she received
FFP x2 and vitamin K 10 units.  She received phenytoin 1g IV.
SBP was in the 200s, and lowered to <160 with labetalol IV.
Neurosurgery was consulted but the family requested no
neurosurgical intervention.

Code status was discussed with the family; they would like to
continue full code status currently but may reconsider over the
next several days.
