HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This 72 year old white male has
extensive coronary artery disease with many angioplasties and
stents and brachy-therapy.  His last intervention was in
[**2129-1-22**] and he presented with chest pain on [**3-27**] to
the [**Hospital6 256**] Emergency
Department.  He has had six percutaneous coronary
interventions and he presented to the Emergency Room after
describing a three to four week history of anginal symptoms
which have been increasing in frequency.  These symptoms
occurred with activity and were relieved with sublingual
nitroglycerin.  He was admitted and his cardiac enzymes were
negative but he did have chest pain with significant ST
depressions and was started on a heparin and nitroglycerin
drip and was also started on Integrilin.  He underwent
cardiac catheterization on [**3-28**] which revealed a 60%
lesion involving the origin of the second diagonal, a 70%
distal left anterior descending lesion, 70% lesion at the
origin of the stented first diagonal with patent stents in
the first diagonal with a 30% stenosis.  There was a 90% left
circumflex lesion in the obtuse marginal 1 stent, a 50%
proximal left circumflex lesion, a 50% inferior branch of the
obtuse marginal 1, and a 40% mid right coronary artery
lesion.  A cutting balloon was applied to the obtuse marginal
1 with adequate results but was noted to have increase in his
inferior sub branch ostial stenosis of 80%.  He continued to
have further episodes of chest pain without electrocardiogram
changes but was referred for coronary artery bypass graft.
He was discharged to home and readmitted on [**4-13**] for
coronary artery bypass graft.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for history of coronary
artery disease, status post PCI times six, most recently in
[**2129-1-22**], history of hypertension, history of
hypercholesterolemia, history of gastroesophageal reflux
disease, history of Hashimoto's thyroiditis, history of
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, history of benign
prostatic hypertrophy, status post inguinal hernia repair.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Atenolol 25 mg p.o. q. day;
Nitropaste 0.8 transdermal q. day; Plavix 75 mg p.o. q. day;
Lipitor 20 mg p.o. q. day; Aspirin 325 mg p.o. q. day;
Folgard 1 tablet p.o. q. day; Protonix 40 mg p.o. b.i.d.;
Flomax 0.4 mg p.o. q.h.s.; Synthroid 150 mcg p.o. q. day

SOCIAL HISTORY:  He has a remote smoking history, 80 pack
years and quit in [**2128-4-21**].  He has occasional alcohol use,
remote history of cocaine greater than ten years ago and
denies any intravenous drugs.  Works as an independent
editor.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Significant for coronary artery disease.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Unremarkable.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On physical examination he is a well
developed, well nourished white male in no apparent distress.
Vital signs are stable.  Afebrile.  Head, eyes, ears, nose
and throat examination, normocephalic, atraumatic,
extraocular movements intact.  Oropharynx benign.  Neck was
supple.  Full range of motion, no lymphadenopathy or
thyromegaly.  Carotids, 2+ and equal bilaterally without
bruits.  Lungs clear to auscultation and percussion.
Cardiovascular examination, regular rate and rhythm, normal
S1 and S2 with no rubs, murmurs or gallops.  Abdomen was
soft, nontender with positive bowel sounds, no masses or
hepatosplenomegaly.  Extremities, without cyanosis, clubbing
or edema.  Pulses were 2+ and equal bilaterally throughout.
Neurological examination was nonfocal.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  On [**4-13**] he underwent operative coronary
artery bypass graft times four with left internal mammary
artery to the left anterior descending, reverse saphenous
vein graft to the distal left anterior descending, obtuse
marginal and diagonal.  The patient tolerated the procedure
well and was transferred to the CSRU.  He was extubated and
he had some postoperative electrocardiogram changes.  He then
had an echocardiogram which revealed a decreased ejection
fraction.  He underwent cardiac catheterization on [**4-14**],
postoperative day #1 which revealed the left main had mild
disease, left anterior descending had moderate disease.  The
left circumflex was having anomalous origin and the obtuse
marginal graft was patent.  The right coronary artery had
mild disease.  The saphenous vein graft to the diagonal was
patent.  The saphenous vein graft to the left anterior
descending was patent and the left internal mammary artery to
the left anterior descending had a 40% stenosis with a
question of it being at the pericardial entry.  He was felt
to have very poor targets and no further treatment was
warranted.  He was started on an ACE inhibitor.  He was seen
by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] who wanted him to have a follow up echocardiogram
in one month and have electrophysiology see him as he had a
six beat run of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia on
postoperative day #4.  He was eventually transferred to the
floor in stable condition.  He was restarted on Plavix and
had his wires out on postoperative day #3.  He continued to
progress and was discharged to home on postoperative day #7
in stable condition.  He did have a couple of episodes of
light hypotension prior to discharge but this resolved with
increased p.o. intake and decrease in his Lopressor and
changing him to Atenolol.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
1.  Pravachol 20 mg p.o. q. day
2.  Flomax 0.4 mg p.o. q.h.s.
3.  Lisinopril 5 mg p.o. q.h.s.
4.  Atenolol 25 mg p.o. q. day
5.  Ecotrin 325 mg p.o. q. day
6.  Protonix 40 mg p.o. b.i.d.
7.  Plavix 75 mg p.o. q. day
8.  Imdur 60 mg p.o. q. day
9.  Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d.
10. Percocet 1 to 2 p.o. q. 4-6 hours prn pain
11. Levoxyl 150 mcg p.o. q. day

LABORATORY DATA:  Laboratory data on discharge revealed
hematocrit 34.5, white count 7,300, platelets 378, sodium
133, potassium 4.3, chloride 117, carbon dioxide 25, BUN 12,
creatinine 1.0, blood sugar 85.

FOLLOW UP:  He will be followed in one to two weeks by Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 42169**], four weeks with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and four weeks with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] for a cardiac echocardiogram.
