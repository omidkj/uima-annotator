Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 107314**] is a 20yo man with PMH of ? CHF, afib on
coumadin, who
presents with fever and SOB, admitted for PNA.
.
# PNA - febrile to 104 in the ED, with LLL infiltrate on CXR. No
HAP risk factors. Started on broad coverage, narrowed to
levaquin on discharge. Started on NIPPV, rapidly transitioned to
NC and room air by the time of discharged. Sent home after 3
nights, > 48 hours afebrile, to complete 7 days of antibiosis
with chest PT and incentive spirometry for poor secretion
clearance

.
# Hypoxemia - likely multifactorial from PNA + contribution from
acute CHF exacerbation. Responded to brief NIPPV, O2 by NC, and
aggressive pulm toilet. Discharged on room air
.
# acute CHF, ? diastolic - echo from [**2141**] showed preserved EF.
Current presentation (CXR, vigorous repsonse to IV lasix and
improvement on CPAP, LE edmea and mildly elevated JVP) do
suggest some component of volume overload.

-- renally dose medications
.
# Afib:
restarted diltiazem. taught caretakers to no crush the XR
formulation
.
# Dementia
-- continue namenda
