History of Present Illness:
The pt is a 72 year-old right-handed woman with a history of
hypertension who presented as a transfer from an OSH with an
ICH.
.
The pt was unable to offer a history at the time of my
encounter. Therefore, the following history is per the medical
record and the pt's husband.
.
The pt had been otherwise in her usual state of health and was
without complaint until approximately 7:30pm on the evening
prior to transfer.  At that time, she finished her dinner and
told her husband that her left leg felt "numb."  He noticed that
she had some difficulty walking, but was able to do so and went
to rest on the couch in their living room.  When her husband
went back to check on her at around 9pm, he noticed that she had
a left facial droop and was slurring her words.  He intended to
bring her to a local ED, but the pt was initially reluctant.  He
subsequently called 911 and she was taken to an OSH.
.
At the OSH, she was noted to have a flaccid hemiparesis on the
left. She underwent a CT scan which showed a right putaminal
hemorrhage.  Reportedly, she became progressively somnolent and
was intubated for airway protection (received etomidate,
succinylcholine, lidocaine for intubation at 2330).  She was
subsequently given 4mg of ativan (at 2327 and 2348) and 1g of IV
dilantin (at 2330)- no convulsive activity documented. She was
also given 15mg of IV labetalol at the OSH for BP of 168/108 on
arrival. No subsequent vital signs documented. Per the ED
resident, the pt was given an indeterminate amount of IV ativan
en route from the OSH (no EMS report could be found).
.
The pt was unable to offer a review of systems.

Social History:
Retired but worked in business, mostly for non-profit
organizations. No history of tobacco or illicit drug use.
Occasional alcohol use.

Radiologic Data
MR CONTRAST GADOLIN  [**2124-5-3**] 1:27 PM
IMPRESSION:
1. Right putaminal hemorrhage without underlying mass, with
imaging features strongly favoring a hypertensive etiology.
2. Patent circle of [**Location (un) 431**] and major tributaries.
.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2124-5-3**] 12:54 AM
FINDINGS: There is a 4.3 x 4.0 x 2.1 cm parenchymal hemorrhage
involving the right putamen and subinsular white matter. Noted
is a dependent blood-fluid level, dorsally. There is no
significant associated shift of normally midline structures. The
ventricles appear normal in size and are symmetric. No
hemorrhage is identified within the basal cisterns or
ventricles. There is no evidence of hydrocephalus. Osseous and
soft tissue structures are unremarkable. There is fluid within
the right maxillary sinus. The orbits are unremarkable.
IMPRESSION: 4.3 x 4.0 x 2.1 cm parenchymal hemorrhage involving
the right putamen and subinsular white mater. This is a typical
location for hypertensive bleed.
.
CHEST (SINGLE VIEW)  [**2124-5-3**] 12:52 AM
IMPRESSION: Endotracheal and nasogastric tubes in appropriate
position. Retrocardiac opacity concerning for pneumonia.
.
EEG [**2124-5-3**]
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG, due to a markedly reduced voltage
record with
some rare alpha activity biposteriorly in most delayed portions
of the
record. The precentral beta represents an Ativan effect related
to
medication administered earlier to the patient. The record
overall
suggests a mild to moderate encephalopathy with excessive
drowsiness and
slowed and poorly sustained posterior background rhythm's.
.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2124-5-4**] 3:41 PM
CONCLUSION: No change in the appearance of the brain since
[**2124-5-3**]. Right putaminal hemorrhage with surrounding edema. No
evidence of new hemorrhage.
.
CXR [**5-14**]:Left subclavian vein catheter and tracheostomy tube
appear unchanged in position. There is a left retrocardiac
opacity, which appears stable and may represent atelectasis
and/or consolidation. There are atelectatic changes at the right
lung base. There probably is a small pleural effusion on the
left.
.
CXR [**5-5**]:
The endotracheal tube and NG tube remain in satisfactory
position. There are relatively low lung volumes. There is
persistent left lower lobe opacity, which could reflect
aspiration or pneumonia. There is also persistent left-sided
effusion. No other significant changes are identified.


Brief Hospital Course:
Patient was admitted to the neuro ICU, sedated, intubated, and
with a diagnosis of R putaminal hemorrhage. Different
