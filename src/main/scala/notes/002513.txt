Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3705**]
Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 41058**] is a 79 year old female with a complex past medical
history significant for ANCA vasculitis on chronic prednisone
15mg, essential thrombocytosis and hypertension who presents
with a 10 day history of congestion, 5-day history of throbbing
headache, cough, pleuritic chest pain and worsening dyspnea.
The patient was reportedly in her normal state of health until
approximately 10 days ago, when she began to experience nasal
congestion which is like her usual ANCA vasculitis flare.  She
was told to increase her prednisone to 20mg daily and was
started on azithromycin by her PCP for her flare.  She improved
over next few days but started worsening five days ago with
cough, pleuritic chest pain and worsening shortness of breath.
She started another course of azithromycin along with
continuation of her steroids.  Last night at dinner, she had
acute worsening of her shortness of breath which prompted her to
call EMS.  She required 100% NRB and thus was transferred to
[**Hospital1 18**] ED as she was thought too unstable to make it to [**Hospital1 336**].

Of note, she describes this episode of acute
SOB/cough/congestion as similar to past "flares" of her
vasculitis.  These episodes usually occur every 3 months for
which her dose of prednisone is increased and she takes a
z-pack.  Her symptoms were not responsive this time to this
regimen. She does not take Bactrim for regular PCP pneumonia
prophylaxis.

Additionally, she reports she took a long flight to [**State 108**] 2
weeks ago.  No sick contacts or travel out of the country.

STUDIES:
CXR ([**12-2**]): Fullness of the hila and prominence of the
interstitial markings, suggest mild pulmonary edema. Patchy
retrocardiac opacity may relate to edema, although underlying
consolidation cannot be excluded.
.
CXR ([**12-4**]): Mild pulmonary vascular congestion. Increased
density in the left lower lobe suspicious for underlying
pneumonia. Clinical correlation is recommended.

Brief Hospital Course:
79 year old female with ANCA vasculitis on chronic prednisone,
essential thrombocythemia and hypertension who presents with a
10 day history of congestion, 5-day history of cough, pleuritic
chest pain and worsening dyspnea admitted on [**2157-12-3**] and
discharged on [**2157-12-4**].

# Worsening dyspnea, multifactorial.  Likely flare of vasculitis
in the setting of possible community acquired pneumonia.  This
is also complicated by pulmonary edema seen on CXR, elevated
BNP, and plateaued troponin values.  Her initial symptoms were
similar (rhinorrhea, post-nasal drip, ear pain) to prior
vasculitis flare.  Because of her requirement of NRB, she was
transferred to the MICU for respiratory status management.  She
was ruled out of MI given unchanged EKG and initial negative
troponin.  Repeat troponins were mildly elevated, but likely in
the setting of her CKD and possible demand that she had
initially.  PE was considered given her underlying ET and sudden
onset, but her symptoms improved with treatments of pneumonia,
pulmonary edema, and vasculitis.  Patient's symptoms improved
with antibiotics (vancomycin and levofloxacin in the ED and then
levofloxacin for the rest of her stay), prednisone, as well as
diuresis with IV
