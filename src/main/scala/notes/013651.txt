Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5893**]
Chief Complaint:
Altered mental status

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Right thoracentesis under US guidance

History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **] y/o F with PMHx of Afib, s/p PCM, CAD s/p MI, PVD and CVA who
was transferred from NH for unresponsiveness. Per report, pt has
been in her usual state of health and this morning, she awoke
and ambulated with her [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 56231**] to breakfast.
However, she became notably unresponsive while waiting for her
breakfast. Her initial BS was 84, SBP 140s-180s, 84% on RA and
withdrew to sternal rub. She appeared to be moving extremities
but was overall unresponsive. EMS was called and pt was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] ED.
.
In the ED, initial vs were: T 98.8 P 70 BP 105/56 R 20-24 O2sat
96% on 3L. Pt was noted to desat on 3L but was repositioned and
sats came back up. Pupils were notably pinpoint but reactive.
Head CT was negative for ICH, CTA was negative for PE but
revealed large right pleural effusion. Urine tox screen was
negative. Urine and blood Cx were sent and pt was given
Levofloxacin, Ceftriaxone and Vancomycin for possible PNA.
.
On arrival to the ICU, pt was minimally responsive. She
withdraws to sternal rub but does not respond to verbal stim.
She was given Narcan 0.6mg without any significant
.
Of note, pt ambulates [**Hospital1 56231**] at baseline. She completes
most ADLs [**Hospital1 56231**] and is very hard of hearing. She can
read english but speaks russian. Pt interacts appropriately with
neice but is not oriented at all times. Her baseline is slurred
speach and difficulty swallowing.
.

Culture Data
[**2102-6-13**]: Urine--Klebsiella >100,000 ORGANISMS/ML.
Pending cultures: blood culture
.
CTA w/ and w/o contrast ([**2102-6-13**]):
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
2. Moderate-to-large in size right pleural effusion and small
left pleural
effusion.
3. Scattered areas of linear atelectasis involving the right and
left lower lobes and the right middle [**Month/Day/Year 3630**].
4. Enlarged heterogeneous appearance of the thyroid, most
compatible with
multinodular goiter.
5. Enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes of uncertain etiology, could
be reactive in nature.
6. Borderline enlarged main pulmonary trunk measuring 3.3 cm,
compatible with pulmonary hypertension.

CT head ([**2102-6-13**]): No evidence of hemorrhage. Extensive
encephalomalacic changes. However, given the lack of prior
studies and the appearance of white matter changes in the right
frontal [**Last Name (LF) 3630**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] acute component of abnormality cannot be
exlcuded. In addition, identification of any small areas of
acute infarction is difficult given the extensive white matter
changes. Hence, MR [**Name13 (STitle) 430**] with DWI can be considered for better
assessment.
.
ECHO [**2102-6-16**]: severe pulmonary hypertension; moderate-to-severe
tricuspid regurgitation; dilated, hypocontractile right
ventricle
.
[**2102-6-21**] Right thoracentesis: 3+ PMNs, no micro organisms seens,
cytology and cultures pending

Brief Hospital Course:
[**Age over 90 **] y/o F with PMHx of Afib, CAD s/p MI and PVD who presents with
altered mental status.
.
Altered mental status: The patient intially presented with
altered mental status of unknown etiology with a Ddx of acute
CVA or intracranial hemorrhage, infection, post-ictal state,
opioid toxicity, hypercarbia, or pulmonary embolism. The patient
had a CTA with contrast that r/o a PE. A CT of the head revealed
old infarcts, however, new infarcts could not be excluded.
Neurology consulted on the patient and suggested a MRI given
difficulty in recognizing acute infarct on CT, however, patient
cannot get an MRI due to her pacemaker. A U/A revealed a UTI and
a urine culture revealed pan-sensitive Klebsiella. After a
course of antibiotics, the patient's mental status improved. A
RPR, TSH, B12 and folate were all within normal range.
.
Acute diastolic heart failure/pleural effusion: The patient had
a TTE showing LVEF=65=70% with no LVH. While in the the ICU, the
patient developed an acute episode of respiratory distress and
her BNP was elevated ~16,000 (on admission~3000). A Lasix gtt
was started and the patient's oxygenation improved. The patient
has a right>left pleural effusion, likely secondary to her
diastolic heart failure. The effusion was previously noted in an
admission to [**Hospital1 2025**] on [**12-26**] and it was treated with diuresis then.
Because of continued hypoxia and episodes of desaturation during
this admission, patient underwent IR guided thoracentesis during
which 1.2 L of serosanguinous fluid was removed from the right
pleural space.
.
#Hypoxia: Pt's hypoxia attributed to her chronic pleural
effusion and underlying pulmonary hypertension. Initially, there
was a possibly of PE, but CTA with contrast ruled out any PE.
The hypoxia is not responsive to oxygen therapy which raises the
possibility of a R-->L cardiac shunt or an intrapulmonary shunt.
A CT of the chest revealed atelectasis of the RLL which can be
contributing to her hypoxia. The effusion was drained [**2102-6-21**]
with improvement in oxygenation.  Patient was tried on BiPap but
did not tolerate the mask due to skin breakdown on bridge of
nose.  Concomitant face mask and nasal canula were used to
maintain her saturation.  Because of continued episodes of
desaturation, patient underwent thoracentesis of the right
pleural effusion with improvement of oxygenation status, able to
oxygenate well just on supplemental oxygen by nasal cannula.
Patient was discharged saturating 94% on 6L of O2 back to
nursing home.

# UTI: Pt with grossly positive UA and mental status changes, so
she w
