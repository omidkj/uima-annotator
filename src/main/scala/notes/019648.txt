Brief Hospital Course:
The patient 54 yeare gentleman who presented with an extensive
pulmonary history complicated by persistant episodes of
shortness of breath. He was admitted to the hospital for stent
removal on [**2183-7-29**]. The patient tolerated removal of two stents
(one in the left main stem bronchus the other in the trachea) by
interventional pulmonology; the procedure went well and the
patient and was transferred to the regular hospital floor.
Please see the operative note for further detail. While on the
regular hospital floor the patient underwent preop testing  by
the medicine team and was stabilized prior to tracheoplasty. The
patient was on all his home medications inaddition to IV
vancomycin, itraconazole, and levaquin. The patient was on broad
spectrum antiobiotics for a history of MRSA, aspergillus from
pulmonary secretions and levaquin for empirical coverage for
sinusitis and tracheobronchitis.(The itraconazole was added to
cover for a sputum sample that grew aspergillus in [**5-23**], the
levaquin was supposed to prophylactically cover for sinusitis
and tracheobronchitis while the Vanco was prescribed to cover
MRSA cultured from sputum.) Patient went to the operating room
on [**2183-8-1**] for a tracheoplasty and percutaneous trach, the
patient tolerated the surgery well please see the operative note
for additional detail. After being stabilized in the PACU the
patient was transferred to the Cardio-Pulmonary ICU. The patient
was followed closely by interventional pulmonology with multiple
flexible bronchoscopies in order to suction his airways. The
patient was also followed closely and seen every day by the
[**Last Name (un) **] Diabetes Center for blood sugar control. On post op day
one the patient was intubated on 40% FIO2 with chest tube to
water seal and an epidural catheter for pain control. The
patient was bronched by IP and had scant secretions. On post op
day 2 the patient experienced some anxiety for which he recieved
ativan prn. The patient remained mechanically ventilated, abg
was still acidotic, patient's mobility improved. On post op day
three patient had speech and swallow study, they recommended a
soft solid diet with thin liquids. Medications should be taken
with water, patient must be sitting fully upright anytime he
eats or drinks to prevent aspiration. The patient was weened
from the vent and had his trach changed from a #6 shiley to a #7
portex. On postop day six the patient worked well with physical
therapy. Patient was put on a trach collar and started on lasix
for diuresis. Patient's levaquin was discontinued on post op day
6. On post op days 7 through 10 the patient continued to be
bronched periodically by interventional pulmonary team in order
to clear his secretions. The patient's humalog sliding scale was
tightened for improved blood sugar control. Physical therpy
worked with the patient to improve strength and help with
transfers from bed to chair. The patient continues to require
CPAP with pressure support, latest setting were tidal volume of
530, RR 16, PS 12, PEEP 8. Patient grew out a positive sputum
culture for MRSA on [**8-4**] and will require an additional three
weeks of linazolid or IV vanc. The patient grew out aspergillus
in early [**Month (only) **] for which he is being covered with Itraconazole.
It is very important that the patient's mesh tracheoplasty graft
not become infected therefore fastidious antibacterial
precautions are necessary. [**Last Name (un) **] diabetes center recommends the
patient be on a humalog sliding scale prior to breakfast, lunch
and dinner in addition to 40U of lantus qhs. The patient will
require acute respiratory rehab upon transfer to [**Hospital1 54543**]. He is on all oral medications and has no further
acute surgical issues. The patient should call in order to
schedule a follow up appointment with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 952**] ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 54544**].
