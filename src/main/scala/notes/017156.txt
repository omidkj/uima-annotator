History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Known lastname 13469**] is a 69yo gentleman known to the hospital
medicine and ICU team who was recently admitted with weakness
and aspiration and who now presents with hypotension.

Mr. [**Known lastname 13469**] was admitted [**Date range (1) 63728**] with c/o weakness.  During
that admission, he briefly stayed in the ICU overnight for
concern of pneumonia, which resolved quickly and was therefore
felt to represent aspiration pneumonitis.  A Chest CT done
immediately after his ICU stay documented resolution of his left
lower lobe consolidation but persistent atelectasis and
bronchiectasis consistent with recurrent aspiration.

He was discharged on [**12-14**] but states that he was not feeling
well at the time he left the hospital.  He went to his shelter
at [**Hospital1 **] and noted that he was feeling weak and lightheaded.
He reports having a poor appetite but eating yoghurt and taking
in fluids nonetheless.  He states that as part of his intake at
[**Hospital1 **], his blood pressure was checked and was found to be
"very low."  He was therefore sent to the ED for evaluation.

In the ED, initial VS were:  97.0   50/37   58   16   99% RA.
He was alert and oriented and reported chest pain to some but
not all of his examiners.  Labs revealed Na 131, K 5.3 with
BUN/Cr of 37/4.0 and an anion gap of 16.  Lactate was elevated
at 2.4.  A FAST ultrasound was negative for bleed and CXR did
not show infiltrate.  He was given 2g of calcium gluconate and
6L of IVF and a subclavian line was placed.  He was making
urine.  He was given 10mg of IV decadron for concern of adrenal
insufficiency.  While he was in the ED, he denied suicidality or
ingestion of pills, even after he was seen in his room with an
open bottle of colace spilled in front of him.  He was started
on dopamine just prior to being sent to the ICU.

Upon arrival to the ICU, he was resting comfortably in bed and
asking for ginger ale.  He denied chest pain.  He stated he had
had an episode of non-bloody emesis en route to the ICU,
although this was not reported by the staff who transferred him.
 He also denied suicidality or medication overdose.

Studies:

[**2132-12-15**] Normal sinus rhythm. Tracing is within normal limits.

[**2132-12-15**] CXR: Persistent vague opacity in the left lower lung
likely represents atelectasis or pneumonia.

[**2132-12-15**] CXR: 1. Left subclavian catheter terminates at upper
SVC without pneumothorax.  2. Vague increase in left lung base
opacity may represent atelectasis vs pneumonia.

+/- renal failure and aspiration presented with hypotension,
bradycardia and acute renal failure, which is thought to be due
to beta blocker and ACE inhibitor over dose.

#. Hypotension: He presented with hypotension felt to be relate
