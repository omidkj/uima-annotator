shortness of breath

History of Present Illness:
74 yo man with h/o COPD (steroid dependent, on home 2-3L 02) who
was in his USOH until 3d PTA when he became progressively short
of breath, with DOE requiring up to 4L 02 at home. At 2am the
morning of admission he noted increased dyspnea, chills, feeling
hot and cold. Temperature was not taken. Patient had no chest
pain, abdominal pain, dysuria, increased cough, or increased
peripheral edema. Denies sick contacts. At 5am, his wife called
911 and was sent to [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**]. Per initial EMS he had sat 80%,
SBP 80, placed on high flow mask. On arrival at the ED he had a
temp of 102 his sat was 96% on NRB, BP 220/130 HR 102 . Initial
ABG 7.38/66/74 (on NRB). CXR concerning for heart failure. Blood
and urine cultures sent. He rec'd 500cc NS, 80mg IV lasix, 125mg
solumedrol IV, ceftriaxone 1gm iv, azithromycin 500mg iv,
combivent nebs, and was intubated after attempted BIPAP (with
etomidate/succ/versed).
Labs showed CO2 37.5, creat 1.3, CK 130, MB 2.2, Index 1.7, Trop
0.04, BNP 798m WBC 12.6 (83% PMN, 6 bands), hct 41.3, UA neg. He
was transferred ED to ED for ICU admission. On arrival in the
[**Hospital1 18**] ED, he was febrile at 104, had L IJ central line placed
and was transferred to the ICU for further management of his
respiratory failure.

Pertinent Results:
[**8-10**] echo:Conclusions:
The left atrium is dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is mildly dilated.
There is mild
regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
inferolateral
akinesis/hypokinesis. Overall left ventricular systolic function
is mildly depressed.
__
CT CHEST
1.  Dependent lower lobe consolidation and ground-glass
attenuation
accompanied by multilobar, diffuse bronchiolitis (tree-in-[**Male First Name (un) 239**]
pattern),
consistent with diffuse infectious process.  In the setting of
hiatal hernia, aspiration pneumonia is also possible.

2. Tracheobronchomalacia difficult to quantify due to lack of
standardized
breathing instructions.  If warranted clinically, once the
patient's acute
infection has resolved, dedicated CT trachea could be obtained
to better
assess this finding.

3.  Emphysema.

4.  Increased number of mediastinal lymph nodes, likely
hyperplastic in the setting of acute infection.  These could
also be reassessed at the time of followup CT.

5.  Diffuse coronary artery calcifications.

6.  Small cystic lesions in the liver and kidneys, incompletely
characterized.
These could be more fully characterized by ultrasound if
warranted clinically.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 74 yo man with h/o COPD (steroid dependent, on home 2-3L
02), dilated LA, MR who was admitted for progressive dyspnea and
respiratory failure likely due to PNA, acute flash pulmonary
edema.
#) Respiratory failure: multifactorial with PNA (new infiltrate
on CXR, cough with sputum), flash pulmonary edema from likely
dietary indiscretion in setting of chronic CHF, COPD
exacerbation. Patient has good 02 sat on home 02 2-3L NC.
#1 PNEUMONIA -rx'd for community acquired pneumonia with CTX and
Azithro
-infiltrate on CXR is improved, remained afebrile, WBC stable.
Extubated [**8-12**], and ultimately transferred to the general floor
on [**2163-8-14**].
-he remained stable on home O2 regimen of 2L NC.
-completed 5 day course of azithromycin
.
.
#) COPD exacerbation- s/p multiple hospitalizations requiring
steroid tapers and prednisone 10mg at home at [**Date Range 5348**]
-treated for component of copd exacerbation as well
- on prednisone 60mg PO QD with slow taper
- continue albuterol/ipratroprium/beclomethasone MDI
-slow prednisone taper
    -prednisone 60mg po qd x 4 days
then-prednisone 40mg po qd x 7 days
then predisone  20mg po qd x 7 days
then prednisone 10mg po qd and continue (home dose)
.
#) CHF - with preserved EF per last ECHO with dilated LA.
- diuresed with improvement in symptoms,
- continued beta blocker, ACE inhibitor
.
#) Atrial fibrillation: HR ranged from 71-125. -some elevated HR
with activity but remained asymptomatic and mainly rate
controlled throughout the day.
-currently on metoprolol 25mg po bid, but could titrate up as
needed for improved rate control.
.
#) Anticoagulation: -had supra therapeutic INR to 8.0, no
significant bleeding complications, coumadin was held and
treated with vit.K.
had some hematuria which resolved.
-home dose coumadin should be restarted.
-start coumadin 2.5 mg po qd and titrate up
- follow INR
.
#) CAD: EKG unchanged, cardiac enzymes negative x3
- continued aspirin, statin, lopressor, lisinopril
.
#) Neuropathy with chronic pain
- continue home fentanyl patch, gabapentin
.
#) Depression
- continue home sertraline
