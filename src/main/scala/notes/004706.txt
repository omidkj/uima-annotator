HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 53 year old
woman transferred to the [**Hospital6 256**]
from the [**Hospital6 **] following an Intensive Care
Unit admission for cardiopulmonary arrest at home.  The
patient was reported to have had increasing shortness of
breath and dyspnea on exertion for two days prior to
[**2138-10-6**] when she was found down on the ground at
home.  911 was called and the patient later shocked back to a
normal sinus rhythm from asystole documented on an automated
external defibrillator.  She was also intubated in the field.
 Her transfer to the [**Hospital6 256**]
from the [**Hospital6 **] was delayed by some
difficulties in transferring her because of her ventilator
dependence.  The patient has a history of Hodgkin's lymphoma
status post mantle radiation in the 70s complicated by
radiation pulmonary fibrosis.  The patient also developed
some constrictive pericarditis that required a pericardial
window in the 80s.  The patient has a history of progressive
dyspnea on exertion over the past five years with oxygen
dependence over the past two years.  She also has recurrent
congestive heart failure.  During the spring of [**2138**], the
patient presented with increasing shortness of breath and
severe orthopnea which was later found to be secondary to
fibrotic entrapment of her left lung.  The patient later
underwent decortication of her left lung in [**2138-6-7**].  She
was later discharged to a rehabilitation facility where she
suffered a cardiopulmonary arrest later in [**2138-6-7**].  The
patient was resuscitated and transferred to the [**Hospital6 1760**] where she recovered after a
period in the Intensive Care Unit.  She has since then had
recurrent problems with aspiration pneumonia.  She was
ultimately discharged home.  She appeared to be doing well
until the current episode of cardiopulmonary arrest.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1.  Status post Hodgkin's disease with
radiation therapy; 2.  Restrictive lung disease, status post
lung decortication in [**2138-6-7**]; 3.  Status post
cardiopulmonary arrest in [**2138-6-7**]; 4.  Status post
restrictive pericarditis with pericardial stripping in [**2128**];
5.  Status post multiple episodes of aspiration; 6.  Status
post tracheostomy; 7.  Left ventricular systolic dysfunction
with an ejection fraction of 30%; 8.  Hypothyroidism; 9.
Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1.  Versed infusion at 14 mg/hr
2.  Aspirin 325 mg per gastrostomy tube q.d.
3.  L-Thyroxine 100 mcg per gastrostomy tube q.d.
4.  Ranitidine 150 mg per gastrostomy tube q.d.
5.  Peri-Colace b.i.d.
6.  Metronidazole 500 mg per gastrostomy tube t.i.d.
7.  Vancomycin 1 gm intravenously q. 12 hours
8.  Lasix 5 mg intravenously q.d.
9.  Ceftriaxone 1 gm intravenously q.d.
10. Albuterol/Atrovent metered dose inhalers 10 puffs q. 4
hours
11. Ventilator with the following settings:  SIMV at 12 with
PF of 18; PV of 400 cc; positive end-expiratory pressure of
5.

ALLERGIES:  Intravenous dye.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient does not have a smoking history.
The patient lives with her significant other and has a very
strong social support system.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was transferred from the [**Hospital6 11241**] to the [**Hospital6 256**] on
[**2138-10-15**].  She was admitted to the Cardiac Surgery
Intensive Care Unit.  She was kept on a ventilator and
received aggressive respiratory therapy.  On [**2138-10-17**], the patient was taken to the Operating Room for an open
tracheostomy tube placement as well as a flexible
bronchoscopy with tracheobronchial aspirations.  The patient
required a repeat flexible bronchoscopy on [**2138-10-21**]
following an episode of emesis during which he aspirated.
During the period between [**2138-10-21**] and [**2138-11-11**] the patient remained in the Intensive Care Unit.
Although efforts were made to extubate her as early as
possible, she continued to have thick yellow secretions that
required frequent suction by respiratory therapy.  Due to the
problem with aspiration, the patient was ultimately taken to
the Operating Room for the placement of a jejunostomy tube.
While in the Intensive Care Unit the patient received
physical therapy.  Towards the end of her Intensive Care Unit
admission she would tolerate significant periods of time off
of the ventilator and began to ambulate.  By [**2138-11-12**]
the patient was deemed stable enough for transfer to
Cardiothoracic Surgery Floor.  She was left off of the
ventilator.  Discharge planning was initiated with an aim of
having the patient transferred to a rehabilitation facility
for continued physical therapy, respiratory therapy, and
close monitoring.
