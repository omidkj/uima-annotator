History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 2816**] is a 73 yo female with PMH significant for ILD on
[**1-27**].5L home O2, diastolic CHF, cor pulmonale, s/p liver
[**Date Range **] on immunosuppression, post-[**Date Range **]
myeloproliferative disorder s/p CHOP and rituximab who was
initially admitted to hospital after a mechanical fall for pain
control who is now being transferred to the MICU for
hypercarbic/hypoxic respiratory failure in the setting of
emesis. Patient was initially admitted to the medicine service
on [**12-10**] for a mechanical fall. She stated that prior to her
fall she was in her USOH without any change in her baseline
respiratory status or other new symptoms. She stepped on her
scale and then lost her balance and landed on her low back. She
was then brought to [**Hospital1 18**] ED. There was no head trauma or LOC by
report. Here, spine films revealed no acute fracture. She was
being treated with PT and pain control. She was not receiving
any opiates due to underlying lung disease. She did received
tylenol, ibuprofen, and lidoderm patch.
.
Yesterday evening, the patient triggered after an episode of
nausea and vomiting as well as a drop in her O2 saturation.
Changed to face mask with improvement in O2. She remained
hemodynamically stable. No CXR or ABG was performed. Changed to
40% ventimask and satting in mid-90s. At 10:30 this am, looks
ashen, cyanotic, and lethargic on 4 L of 50% venti. O2 in high
70s at that time. Sleepy but arousable. Increased O2 to 15L on
50% ventimask. Given nebs. On exam, tight air movement and
cracklie but not significantly different from baseline. Initial
gas 7.29/97/113 on 15L 50% ventimask. Last ABG in system
7.43/47/73 in 3/[**2124**]. Mental status improved with increase in
oxygenation. She was given solumedrol 100 mg IV Q8H. Reevaluated
in 1 hr, still lethargic but arousable. Repeat ABG 7.28/108/79
on 15L 50% ventimask. CXR performed on floor, showed some
diffuse fluffiness. She received 40 mg IV lasix. She continues
to have intermittent nausea and vomiting with 2-3 episodes of
emesis since yesterday evening.
.
n the MICU, she was intubated on [**12-12**] for worsening
hypercarbia. That evening she spiked a fever, went into AF vs
MAT with HRs into the 160s, and hypotension to the 80s. She did
not tolerate beta blockers at that time and was started on an
amiodarone gtt. She was also started on empiric vancomycin and
zosyn for possible aspiration pna. She received aggressive
volume resuscitation and converted to NSR the following morning.
Her amiodarone was discontinued given concern for worsening lung
and liver disease. Her beta blocker was uptitrated. Antibiotics
were briefly discontinued on [**12-14**] and restarted on [**12-15**]. She
was eventually diuresed and was able to be extubated on [**12-16**].
She was called out to the medical floor on [**12-17**].
.
While on the medical floor, she was continued on vancomycin and
zosyn for presumed aspiration pna. She had no microbiology data
to help guide therapy. She was continued on diuretics but has
run I/O even per documentation. While on floor, SBPOs 100s, HRs
80s, RR 20s, O2 90s on 3LNC.
.
On the evening of transfer, trigger called for increased work of
breathing. Upon floor evaluation, patient denied any subjective
SOB. O2 requirement the same at 90s n 3LNC and no significant
change in RR. However, at ~ MN, patient went into irregular SVT
(AF vs MAT) to 150s, T100.3, with SBPs into 90s, RR increased to
30s, and O2 sats low 90s on 4-6L. She received lopressor 5 mg IV
x 2 without significant change in her HR and decrease in SBP to
80s. CXR repeated without significant change compared to this
am. ABG showed 7.35/73/54.

Brief Hospital Course:
73 yo female with PMH significant for ILD on home O2, diastolic
CHF, cor pulmonale, s/p liver [**Month/Day/Year **] on immunosuppression,
post-[**Month/Day/Year **] myeloproliferative disorder s/p CHOP and
rituximab who was initially admitted to hospital after a
mechanical fall for pain control who was transferred to the MICU
for hypercarbic/hypoxic respiratory failure in the setting of
emesis

# Respiratory failure: In the setting of witnessed emesis prior
to decompensation, pt treated for aspiration/hospital acquired
pneumonia. Weaned from vent and extubated on 4L NC.  Called out
to floor.  Developed acute respiratry distress and transferred
back to MICU. Completed course of abx for HAP/aspiration PNA,
but restarted based on evolving CXR. Eventually in setting of
renal failure pt developed worsening resp status and was placed
on CPAP.  When pt became obtunded discussion with HCp - pt's
daughter it was decided to not intubate and pt passed away from
respiratory failure
.
# Tachycardic arrhythmia: Pt had sinus tachycardia to SVT on
[**12-13**] ? of A-fib vs. MAT. Had resolved when pt was transferred
back to floor from MICU.  On transfer back to the MICU pt's
cardiac issues were managed with toprol.
.
# S/P Fall/Pain control: no evidence of fracture. C/o back pain
initially but pain issues were resolved on second transfer back
to ICU. Pt followed after extubation.
.
# DM: Good FSBG control while hospitalized.
.
# ILD: Pulmonary followed as inpt. Treated pt's PNA.
Alb/atrovent nebs PRN.
.
# PTLD: No known active issues during hospitalization.  LFTs
were normal. Tacrolimus levels were followed.
.
# HTN: On toprol as inpt.
.
# Hypothyroidism: Continued on levothyroxine
.
# Access: PICC line was placed during hospitalization for abx
therapy.
.
# FEN: After aspiration episode, eval'd by speech and swallow.
Made NPO when transferred back to ICU b/c of respiratory
distress and concern for aspiration.
.
# Prophylaxis: Heparin SC 5000 tid, PPI, and Bactrim
.
# Code status: DNR/DNI - intially pt's status was DNR and okay
to intubate, but after discussion with pt's family decision was
made to make pt DNR/DNI.

# Pt passed away from respiratory distress after she was
dependent on non invasive ventilation, then became obtunded and
would have required intubation. After several family meetings
with her primary Pulmonologist Dr.[**Last Name (STitle
