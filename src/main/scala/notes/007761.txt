PATIENT/TEST INFORMATION:
Indication: Mitral valve bioprosthesis (#31).
Hypotension.Evaluate valvular function. ?Tamponade
Height: (in) 68
Weight (lb): 180
BSA (m2): 1.96 m2
BP (mm Hg): 90/50
HR (bpm): 88
Status: Inpatient
Date/Time: [**2133-10-5**] at 06:53
Test: Portable TEE (Complete)
Doppler: Full Doppler and color Doppler
Contrast: None
Tape Number: 2007W000-0:00
Test Location: West SICU/CTIC/VICU
Technical Quality: Adequate




REFERRING DOCTOR: DR. [**First Name (STitle) **] R. [**Doctor Last Name **]

MEASUREMENTS:
Mitral Valve - Mean Gradient: 4 mm Hg

INTERPRETATION:

Findings:

LEFT ATRIUM: No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus in the
body of the [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **]
LAA. Good (>20 cm/s) LAA ejection velocity.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Dynamic interatrial septum.
Small secundum
ASD.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Low normal LVEF.

AORTA: Focal calcifications in ascending aorta. Simple atheroma
in descending
aorta.

AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (3). No
masses or
vegetations on aortic valve. Trace AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Bioprosthetic mitral valve prosthesis (MVR). MVR
well seated,
with normal leaflet/disc motion and transvalvular gradients. No
mass or
vegetation on mitral valve. No MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets with trivial
TR. No mass or
vegetation on tricuspid valve.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflets.
Physiologic
(normal) PR.

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify
I was present in compliance with HCFA regulations. The patient
was monitored
by a nurse [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 9833**] throughout the procedure. The patient
was monitored
by a nurse [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 9833**] throughout the procedure. The patient
was sedated for
the TEE. Medications and dosages are listed above (see Test
Information
section). No TEE related complications.

Conclusions:
No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of
the left
atrium or left atrial appendage. A small secundum atrial septal
defect is
present. Overall left ventricular systolic function is low
normal (LVEF
50-55%). There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic
aorta. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. No masses or
vegetations are
seen on the aortic valve. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. A
bioprosthetic
mitral valve prosthesis is present. The mitral prosthesis
appears well seated,
with normal leaflet/disc motion and transvalvular gradients. No
mass or
vegetation is seen on the mitral valve. No mitral regurgitation
is seen. There
is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Normal functioning mitral valve prothesis.
Low-normal left
ventricular function. Small secundum atrial septal defect.
Simple
atherosclerotic plaque in thoracic aorta. No pericardial
effusion.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2133-10-20**] 8:51 AM

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)

Reason: r/o inf, eff

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
83 year old man with sternal plating now s/p trach /PEG
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
r/o inf, eff
HISTORY: 83-year-old male with sternal plating, now status post
tracheostomy and PEG tube placement. Rule out infiltrate and
effusion.

COMPARISON: Radiograph [**2133-10-16**].

SINGLE PORTABLE VIEW OF THE CHEST: There is again demonstrated
bilateral diffuse interstitial process, with no significant
change from the previous radiograph. There is a small left
pleural effusion. The tracheostomy tube remains approximately 6
cm above the carina, with no significant change in position. No
pneumothorax is identified. The cardiomediastinal contours are
unremarkable.

IMPRESSION:
1. Diffuse bilateral interstitial process, with no change since
[**2133-10-16**].
2. Small left pleural effusion.
