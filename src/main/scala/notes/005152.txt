Date of Birth:  [**2051-7-9**]        Sex:  F

Service:  GYN


ADMISSION DIAGNOSES:  Malignant ascites.

Carcinomatosis.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:  Metastatic primar peritoneal
carcinoma.

Bilateral pleural effusions.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 68-year-old
gravida 4, para 4 0-1-4, who presented on [**2119-9-13**] as a
transfer of care from [**Hospital3 7571**]Hospital.  The patient
had been diagnosed with possible ovarian cancer one month
prior to presentation when she presented to her primary care
physician with increasing shortness of breath and abdominal
distention.  A paracentesis was performed at that time
secondary to increasing shortness of breath and ascites with
positive malignant cells on cytology.  The patient's CA-125
was 24,890.  A CEA was obtained, which is 1.2.  The patient
was transferred on [**2119-9-13**] to [**Hospital1 188**] for preoperative care with plan for tumor debulking.

The patient underwent a preoperative chest x-ray, which
revealed bilateral pleural effusions, which were consistent
with the pleural effusions seen on her chest CT with the
right greater than left pleural effusions.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Status post multiple fractures after a
car accident, status post surgical repair.

PAST OB HISTORY:  NSVD x4.  Delivery one set of twins.  SAB
x1 status post D and E.

PAST GYN HISTORY:  Patient has been menopausal since age 45.
She has had no postmenopausal bleeding, normal Pap smears.
Her last mammogram was greater than five years.  The patient
was unsure of her last Pap smear.

FAMILY HISTORY:  The patient denied breast, ovarian, and
colon cancer.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  She denied tobacco, alcohol, or drug use.

MEDICATIONS:  She presented on [**2119-9-13**] on:
1. Lasix 40 mg p.o. q.d.
2. Levaquin 500 mg p.o. q.d.
3. Lexapro 10 mg p.o. q.d.
4. MS Contin 15 mg b.i.d. for pain.


ALLERGIES:  She is allergic to sulfa.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs on presentation:
Temperature 97.6, blood pressure 100/60, heart rate of 96,
respiratory rate 16, and saturating 94-95 percent on 2
liters.  Physical examination on presentation:  She generally
is in no apparent distress.  Cardiovascular examination is
regular, rate, and rhythm.  Pulmonary examination was clear
to auscultation bilaterally.  Abdomen was soft, nontender,
and distended secondary to ascites.  Sterile vaginal
examination was limited secondary to body habitus.  There is
palpable cervix and vagina, which were within normal limits.
Her rectal was guaiac negative with no masses.  Extremities:
There is trace edema bilaterally.  No erythema.

LABORATORY EVALUATION ON PRESENTATION:  Her white blood cell
count was 7.2, hematocrit was 33.5 percent, platelets were
476.  Her coagulation profile was within normal limits.  Her
Chem-10 was within normal limits.  Her ALT, AST, amylase, T
bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, and albumin were all within
normal limits.

A preoperative chest x-ray was obtained at [**Hospital3 **] on
[**2119-9-13**], which showed bilateral pleural effusions consistent
with prior imaging.

BRIEF HOSPITAL COURSE:  Primary peritoneal carcinoma:  The
patient was taken to the operating room on [**2119-9-14**] and
underwent cytoreductive surgery including total omentectomy
and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy and drainage of ascites.
Surgery was uncomplicated with a blood loss of 300 cc and
approximately 4 liters of ascites drained.  The patient was
admitted to the ICU postoperatively secondary to difficulty
with oxygenation and pain control issues.  Patient's
pathology and cytology from the surgery are consistent with
metastatic primary peritoneal carcinoma Stage IV papillary
serous pathology.

Postoperative course:  On postoperative day number one, the
patient was transferred to the ICU secondary to oxygenation
issues.  She required 4 liters nasal cannula with 100 percent
face mask to keep her O2 saturations approximately 94-96
percent.

On postoperative day number two, after being called out from
the ICU, the patient was found to have an acute desaturation
in her oxygen status.  Her O2 saturations declined to 88
percent on room air, improved to 94 percent on 4 liters.  Her
urine output was also found to be borderline less than 30
cc/hour.  Initially, her pH was 7.47, bicarb is 34, PO2 is
65, base access was 7.  After diuresis, the repeated pH was
7.46, PO2 was 77, PCO2 is 46, calculated bicarb was 34.
Patient underwent a chest x-ray, which showed worsening
bilateral pulmonary effusions.  She was continued on IV
Lasix.

On postoperative day number three, she had a decline in her
oxygenation again.  She underwent a CTA to rule out a
pulmonary embolus, for which she was ruled out.  She also had
some mild chest pain for which she underwent serial cardiac
enzymes, which came back negative.  EKG was obtained, which
was also unchanged from baseline.

On postoperative day number four, the patient was evaluated
by the Medicine consult team and a repeat chest x-ray showed
worsening of her right pleural effusion.  She underwent a
therapeutic thoracentesis with removal of approximately 2
liters of fluid.  This was sent for cultures and cytology.

On postoperative day number five, she underwent a chest x-ray
post thoracentesis, which showed a very small pleural
effusion.  However, she appeared clinically stable at
approximately 94 percent on 4 liters nasal cannula.  This was
then followed up by a repeat chest x-ray on postoperative day
four, which showed no change in the pneumothorax.

On postoperative day number six, her chest x-ray was
repeated, which showed no change in her pneumothorax, and
still remains small and the patient remains clinically
stable.  Per the Medicine consult team, the patient remained
on oxygen supplementation 100 percent by face mask and the
plan was for followup on postoperative day number seven on
[**2119-9-21**] with repeat chest x-ray.

Plan per the Medicine consult team is if chest x-ray is
improved, patient should be weaned off her oxygen as
tolerated.  However, if the pneumothorax starts to increase
or worsen, plan for pleurodesis.

GI:  The patient initially had nausea and vomiting
postoperatively, which resolved and she was able to tolerate
regular diet prior to discharge.

Disposition:  The patient is being discharged to [**Hospital6 57874**] for medical management postoperatively
while concurrently being evaluated for chemotherapy.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Stable.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:  Primary peritoneal carcinoma metastatic
disease.

Bilateral pleural effusions.

Pneumothorax.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1. Dilaudid p.o. as needed for pain.
2. Motrin p.o. as needed for prn pain.



FOLLOW UP:  The patient is to followup with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2406**] for a
postoperative visit as scheduled and to receive chemotherapy
at [**Hospital6 17032**].
