HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mrs. [**Known lastname 33749**] is a 72 -year-old
woman who is followed by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] of the UMG who was
admitted to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 519**] on [**8-2**] in the early morning with a
probable gallstone pancreatitis.  Mrs. [**Known lastname 33749**] underwent a
left carotid endarterectomy by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1476**] on [**7-31**].  At
home, on [**2138-8-1**], Mrs. [**Known lastname 33749**] experienced sudden
onset of an upper abdominal pain with limited emesis.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  She had nausea, vomiting, fever or
chills, and sweats.  She complains of diarrhea, but denies
any melena, hematochezia, or bright red blood per rectum.
She has not had any prior history of a right upper quadrant
pain or indigestion.  There were no relieving factors;
however, the pain was exacerbated by food ingestion.  There
were no urinary symptoms described by the patient.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Coronary artery disease status post myocardial
infarction, congestive heart failure, and on [**2138-2-20**],
percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty with stent.
2.  History of Helicobacter pylori positive upper
gastrointestinal bleed.
3.  Cerebrovascular accident with right sided hemiparesis.
4.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and 30 pack year
smoking history.
5.  A question of chronic renal failure.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:
1.  Left carotid endarterectomy.
2.  Appendectomy.
3.  Right ankle open reduction and internal fixation.

ADMITTING MEDICATIONS:  Lasix, Prevacid, lisinopril,
Albuterol, Atrovent, Flovent, aspirin, Paxil, and Diltiazem.

ALLERGIES:  She has allergies to Levaquin and penicillin
which cause a rash.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission, her temperature was 98.1
F and she was afebrile without chills.  Her blood pressure
was 168/77, heart rate was 106, respiratory rate was 23, and
saturations were 95% on four liters.  She was alert and
oriented times three.  Her lung examination was clear to
auscultation bilaterally.  Heart examination was regular rate
and rhythm.  The abdominal examination showed a soft, obese
abdomen with positive right upper quadrant tenderness,
including a positive [**Doctor Last Name 515**] sign.  She also had percussion
tenderness.  There was a question of a palpable gallbladder
in the right upper quadrant.  The rectal examination was heme
positive with good rectal tone.  The pulses were palpable
bilaterally equally.

PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES:  On admission, the CBC showed an
elevated white count of 20.2 with a hematocrit of 35.8 and
platelets of 33.8.  She had 71% neutrophils and a bandemia of
14%.  Sodium was 137, potassium 5.5, chloride 102,
bicarbonate 19, BUN of 32, and creatinine was elevated to
1.7, with a baseline of 1.0 to 1.4.  Her glucose at the time
was 143.  Liver function tests showed an ALT of 13, AST of
29, and alkaline phosphatase of 79, and a total bilirubin of
0.5.  Amylase was elevated significantly to 571 and lipase
was 1,365.  A urinalysis showed 3 to 5 white blood cells with
moderate bacteria, and less than 1.0 epithelial cells per
high power field.

CT scan as per Dr.[**Name (NI) 1745**] review with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] showed
moderately dilated gallbladder with a vascule over the liver,
mild diffusely intrahepatic ductal dilation, generous common
bile duct at 6.0 mm.  The pancreatic head looked questionably
enlarged with atrophy otherwise.  The ducts were normal.  The
colon was probably normal with or without focal thickening.
There was nothing to suggest cholecystitis.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the General
Surgery team into the Intensive Care Unit for IV hydration,
antibiotics, and for a decision as to whether or not the
gallbladder would receive a percutaneous drain, versus an
endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography
sphincterotomy, versus a laparoscopic cholecystectomy.  In
addition, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1476**] and the Vascular service team will be
following the patient in house as well.

Overnight in the Unit, the patient was stable, but was
continued with tender, right upper quadrant pain.  She had
one episode of nausea.  By hospital day two, her white count
had decreased to 14 and her lipase had significantly
decreased to 28.  The liver function tests were still normal
when repeated, as per the previous day, and amylase was down
to 45 as well.  Mrs.[**Known lastname 33756**] urine output on postoperative
day two was approximately 30-70 cc/hr and she had two bowel
movements.  She continued to be NPO.  She was started at
Flagyl and ceftriaxone at the time because of her Levaquin
allergy, as prophylaxis and treatment for a potential
gallstone pancreatitis.

Because the patient was felt to still be somewhat unstable,
the decision to perform an interventional procedure was
delayed until postoperative day three.  On [**8-4**], an
ultrasound was performed to reevaluate the gallbladder which
showed a mildly distended gallbladder with sludge.  However,
there were no gallbladder stones or thickening, and there was
no pericholecystic fluid.  Mrs.[**Last Name (un) 33756**] vital signs
continued to be stable and her white count continued to fall
from 14.3 to 13 by hospital day four.  The panel 7 continued
to be normal and the amylase and lipase continued to be also
within normal limits at 51.  Stool was sent for Clostridium
difficile that was negative and a urinalysis was also
negative at this time.

Because of the recent carotid endarterectomy, there was much
discussion as to the appropriate management of her condition.
Because she had become stable in the Intensive Care Unit on
[**8-5**], she was transferred to the floor.  There was a
coughing spell on transfer and respiratory therapy helped.
In addition, Mrs. [**Known lastname 33749**] was to have a laparoscopic
cholecystectomy on [**8-5**].  Her laparoscopic
cholecystectomy occurred at approximately 03:00 PM on [**8-5**] and was uneventful.

Mrs. [**Known lastname 33749**] remained on perioperative antibiotics and had a
postoperative hematocrit of 29.5.  By hospital day six, her
hematocrit had returned to 35.3 and she was recovering bowel
function, such that her diet was advanced.  Case manager had
screened her for rehabilitation and on hospital day seven,
her antibiotics were discontinued and she was advanced to a
full diet.  She will be discharged to home with a home
nursing care for taking care of her today, on [**2138-8-7**].

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Stable.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  To home with nursing care.

FOLLOW-UP:  She will follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 519**] in two weeks and
with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1476**] from Vascular in approximately three weeks.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  Percocet one to two tablets po q four
to six hours prn, Colace 100 mg po bid, Serevent two puffs po
bid, Combivent two puffs po tid, Flovent two puffs po bid,
Lasix 40 mg po q day, Ativan 0.5 mg q six hours po prn

hours, Paxil 20 mg po q day, and Flomax 0.4 mg po bid.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Status post right carotid endarterectomy.
2.  Status post laparoscopic cholecystectomy for treatment of
a presumed gallstone pancreatitis.
