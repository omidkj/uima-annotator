Chief Complaint:
Elective Admission for Spinal Surgery


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
elective spinal fusion of T11-S1 with L3 osteotomy


History of Present Illness:
70 y/o female with a h/o HTN, Raynaud's, and scoliosis s/p
multiple surgeries, who is transferred to medicine following
elective spinal fusion of T11-S1 with L3 osteotomy, complicated
by pulmonary embolism with hypotension and flash pulmonary
edema.
.
Postoperatively, the patient initially developed hypotension
requiring transient pressor support and peri-operative blood
loss requiring a total of 6 units of PRBCs. Pressures stabilized
and the patient was transferred to the ortho/spine floor.
However, on [**6-22**], she again triggered for hypotension to 70/40.
She was also noted to have elevated creatinine to 2.6 from a
recent baseline of 1.5, but a prior baseline of 0.9-1.1. She was
also bolused several liters for low UOP with no improvement in
her blood pressure. Medicine consult was obtained at that time.
The patient underwent EKG that showed S1Q3T3 pattern with right
heart strain.  She underwent echo that showed a dilated globally
hypokinetic right ventricle, new moderate pulmonary
hypertension, and moderate TR.  LENIs were negative.  With
persistent hypotension the patient then underwent V/Q scan that
showed pulmonary embolism.  The patient was started on a heparin
drip without bolus, as she had just completed spinal surgery.

.
The patient then went into flash pulmonary edema, and was
transferred to the MICU.  She was diuresed, and did not require
intubation.  The patient diuresed well on 10 mg IV lasix [**Hospital1 **].
.
She currently complains of some wheezing and lower extremity
edema.  She is otherwise without pain and states that she
shooting pain down her legs, with which she first presented, has
resolved.

IMAGING:
CXR ([**6-21**]) - Small left pleural effusion and new left infrahilar
consolidation are most readily explained by atelectasis, but
there is no way to exclude pneumonia. The upper lungs are clear.
 The heart is top normal size.  No pneumothorax.
.
CXR ([**6-22**]) - Heart size and mediastinum are unchanged in
appearance including cardiomegaly. Bibasal atelectasis and
bilateral pleural effusion is unchanged.  No appreciable
pneumothorax is seen.
.
ECHO [**6-22**]
There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The
left ventricular cavity size is normal. Regional left
ventricular wall motion is normal. Left ventricular systolic
function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%). The right ventricular cavity
is mildly dilated with moderate global free wall hypokinesis and
apical sparing (+ Mconnells sign for acute pulmonary embolism).
No aortic regurgitation is seen. No mitral regurgitation is
seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There
is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a
very small pericardial effusion. There are no echocardiographic
signs of tamponade.
.
ECHO [**6-23**]
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are
normal. The left ventricular cavity is unusually small. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50%). The
right ventricular free wall thickness is normal. The right
ventricular cavity is dilated with depressed free wall
contractility. There is abnormal septal motion/position
consistent with right ventricular pressure/volume overload. The
ascending aorta is mildly dilated. There are focal
calcifications in the aortic arch. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Moderate to
severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid
regurgitation is seen. [In the setting of at least moderate to
severe tricuspid regurgitation, the estimated pulmonary artery
systolic pressure may be underestimated due to a very high right
atrial pressure.] There is a small pericardial effusion. There
are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed)
of [**2201-6-22**], the appearance of mitral regurgitation is
increased
