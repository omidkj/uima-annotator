History of Present Illness:
68 yo F with COPD, CHF, admitted for SOB and hypoxia.  Pt c/o
one week history of cough, mild increased SOB and nasal
congestion.  Did briefly have sore throat, but this has since
resolved.  States SOB was most notable when trying to speak in
long sentences, but otherwise she didn't note DOE.  To myself,
denied fever, chills, N/V/D.  Has CP at baseline with movement,
some medication helps but she's not sure which one.  No sick
contacts.

Patient was then interviewed by another physician and reported
cough x 48 hours.  Woke up the morning of admission and felt
acutely SOB, she was given a nebulizer which helped.  Nurse [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 108813**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] noted patient was 'blue'.  Also developed CP which
she states persisted until she reached the ED, when she was
given some medication that helped (unsure which one).  She had
been developing increased LE edema, and occasionally eats too
much salt in her diet.  [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) 2299**] house report desatted to 88%
on RA, and came up to 95 on 2L NC, HR 125 and A&O x 3.

Upon presentation to the ED VS 97.6, 115/75, 118, 20 and satting
96% on 3L.  Physical exam notable for decreased BS b/l with
expiratory wheeze.  EKG with LBBB which was confirmed to be old
by d/c sum from OSH.  CXR notable for cardiomegaly and/or
pericardial effusion with  cardiogenic pulmonary edema.  She was
treated with Combivent nebs x 3, prednisone 60mg po,
Azithromycin, Levoquin 750 mg, IV NS x 500cc and Lasix 40mg IV.
Urinated a total of 1150 cc.

Upon presentation to the floor, she denies any further SOB, and
provides the history as stated above with various discrepencies
upon retelling.

Persistent cardiomegaly is noted with accentuation of the edema
seen in both lungs, indicative of underlying heart failure. The
costophrenic angles are rather mildly blunted secondary to a
small pleural effusion. There is more opacification in the left
retrocardiac area concerning for a new atelectasis. The left
hemidiaphragm is more elevated on today's examination. This
could be either related secondary to the new left lower lobe
atelectasis. However, the gastric bubble is overly distended on
today's examination when compared to the previous study.
IMPRESSION:
1. Persistent cardiomegaly and pulmonary edema indicative of
cardiogenic [**Last Name **] problem.
2. Blunting of the costophrenic angle secondary to small
effusions.
3. The elevated left hemidiaphragm is either secondary to a new
left lower lobe atelectasis or it could be mass effect from an
overly distended gastric bubble.

 TTE (Complete) Done [**2200-4-18**] at 10:38:20 AM      FINAL
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated. The estimated right atrial pressure is 0-5
mmHg. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. There is severe global
left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 20-30 %). There is no
ventricular septal defect. Tissue synchronization imaging
demonstrates significant left ventricular dyssynchrony with the
septal wall contracting 130 ms later than the lateral wall. The
right ventricular cavity is dilated with depressed free wall
contractility. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally
normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no
mitral valve prolapse. Moderate to severe (3+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The left ventricular inflow pattern
suggests a restrictive filling abnormality, with elevated left
atrial pressure. There is a small pericardial effusion. The
effusion appears loculated, subtending the right atrial free
wall. There is brief right atrial diastolic collapse. However,
no signs of frank tamponade.

PERSANTINE MIBI STRESS TEST
INTERPRETATION:

The left arm is down. The image quality is fair-to-good.

Left ventricular cavity size is markedly dilated with an
estimated end diastolic
volume of 245 cc.

Rest and stress perfusion images reveal an apparent fixed
reduction in counts along the distal anteroseptal wall, but this
appearance mostly resolves with attenuation correction and
accordingly is most likely artifactual. An apparent reduction in
counts along the basal inferior wall resolves with attenuation
correction, also suggesting an artifact related to soft tissue
attenuation.

Gated images reveal marked global hypokinesis.

The calculated left ventricular ejection fraction is 21%.

No prior studies are available.

IMPRESSION: 1. No definite focal perfusion defects.
2. Markedly dilated left ventricle with global hypokinesis.
Ejection fraction of 21%.


Brief Hospital Course:
68 year old female with acute SOB and history of CHF and COPD,
ultimately developing hypercarbic respiratory failure, thought
to be secondary to CHF exacerbation. Her heart failure
medications were adjusted for optimal medical management and
further workup deferred to outpatient setting.

HYPERCARBIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE
Likely multifactorial and true history difficult to assess.  Her
dyspnea initially improved in the ED after steroids, antibiotics
and diuresis, but she decompensated on the medical floor and was
transfered to the intensive care unit where she required
intubation.  Pneumonia was considered, but there was no clear
evidence on CXR, she was afebrile and had no leukocytosis.  CTA
to rule out a PE was done and negative.  No history of
aspiration.  Given exam and history her presentation was thought
to be most consistent with CHF, and she was treated primarily
for this etiology.

CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE
ACUTE ON CHRONIC SYSTOLIC AND DIASTOLIC
She was started on low dose metoprolol 12.5 mg po BID and gentle
diuresis was pursued.  With two days of both po and IV Lasix,
she had notable decreased swelling in h
