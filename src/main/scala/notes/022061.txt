Staphylococcus coagulase negative in blood cultures

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to medicine for intractable nausea and
vomiting. Her symptoms triggered an episode of diabetic
ketoacidosis. These were treated with zofran, reglan, ativan and
an insulin sliding scale. She required a one-day ICU stay for
close monitoring and aggressive management. Upon transfer to the
floor, the patient's symptoms resolved and she could maintain
good oral intake. Although she remained asymptomatic and
afebrile throughout, she was found to have a gram positive
coagulase negative bacteremia at the site of her dialysis line
on [**12-9**]. The line was removed on [**12-12**] and a temporary femoral
line was inserted. She received renal doses of vancomycin. A
second tunneled line was placed on [**12-15**] after her blood
cultures were cleared for more than two days. The procedure was
successful and the patient was discharged on [**12-16**] on her usual
medications and with an appointment to visit Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] of
transplant surgery to schedule an arteriovenous fistula
placement. She will continue to take vancomycin for one week
post-discharge.

Discharge Instructions:
You were hospitalized for an episode of nausea, vomiting and
abdominal pain. This caused your diabetes to be out of control
and required a short stay in the ICU. Your problems were
aggressively treated with intravenous medications and an insulin
sliding scale. Blood drawn from your dialysis line revealed some
microbes which required antibiotics and the removal of your
line. A dialysis line was replaced today prior to your
discharge. You must continue your vancomycin for another 10
days. This will be given to you during the dialysis sessions. It
is important that you follow up with your primary care provider
within one week of discharge.

develop:
* uncontrolled nausea, vomiting
