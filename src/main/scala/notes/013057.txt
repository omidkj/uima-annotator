Service:  Medical Intensive Care Unit

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname **] is an 84-year-old
gentleman with medical history significant for atrial
fibrillation treated with Coumadin and glaucoma.  He
presented to the [**Hospital1 69**]
Emergency Room on [**8-12**] from [**Hospital3 4527**] Hospital for
treatment of a subdural hematoma following a fall.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs, temperature 98.8, heart
rate 92 and regular.  His blood pressure is 123/67,
respiratory rate 29 and he is saturating at 98% on 40% trach
collar. General appearance, Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a well developed,
well nourished elderly gentleman with tracheostomy.  He is
mildly agitated but in no acute distress.  He has a well
healed craniotomy scar on the right side.  His pupils are
equal, round and reactive to light.  His oral pharynx is
clear and dry.  His sclera are anicteric.  Neck, supple with
no jugulovenous distension or lymphadenopathy.
Cardiovascular, Mr. [**Known lastname **] is tachycardic with occasional
premature beats.  There are no murmurs, rubs or gallops
appreciated.  Chest, coarse breath sounds throughout
consistent with tracheostomy.  He has mildly decreased breath
sounds in his left lower lobe and occasional faint expiratory
wheezes on his right side.  Abdomen, soft, mildly distended,
nontender, tympanitic with normal bowel sounds.  PEG site is
clean, dry and intact.  Extremities, Mr. [**Known lastname **] has 1+
pitting edema bilateral and symmetrical in his upper
extremities, no edema in his lower extremities.  He has a
PICC line in his left antecubital fossa which is clean, dry

erythema.

LABORATORY DATA:  Mr. [**Known lastname **] has a non contrast CT of the
head on [**8-14**] which [**Month/Year (2) 3780**] a drainage catheter within
the right subdural fluid collection, probably representing a
chronic subdural hematoma.  There was persistent subdural
collection associated with mass effect and shift of the
midline structures.  Mr. [**Known lastname **] also had a follow-up CT of
the head, non contrast on [**8-17**] which showed decrease in size
of the subdural hematoma and decrease in the midline shift.
He also had another CT of the head, also non contrast on [**8-19**]
which showed no significant change in the size of the
subdural collection overlying the right cerebral hemisphere
with increased interval size in air fluid levels of the
paranasal sinuses.  On [**8-27**] Mr. [**Known lastname **] [**Last Name (Titles) 1834**] another CT
of the head, non contrast, which [**Last Name (Titles) 3780**] slight increase
in anterior portion of the right subdural collection as well
as a more prominent right posterior subdural collection.
There was interval improvement of the sinuses.  Other studies
of note: On [**8-26**] Mr. [**Known lastname **] [**Last Name (Titles) 1834**] a right upper quadrant
ultrasound which [**Last Name (Titles) 3780**] a 1.6 cm stone in the
gallbladder, adenomyomatosis, slightly thickened gallbladder
wall and edema suggesting cholecystitis.  On [**9-7**] Mr. [**Known lastname **]
[**Last Name (Titles) 1834**] a portable chest x-ray which [**Last Name (Titles) 3780**] an
enlarged heart with pulmonary venous engorgement and early
perihilar pulmonary edema and a possible opacification at the
left base, either consolidation or pleural effusion.  On [**9-9**]
Mr. [**Known lastname **] had laboratory studies drawn which included the
following:  A complete blood count showing a white blood cell
count of 10,200, hematocrit 32.5 and platelet count 257,000.
He had a PT of 13.5, PTT 25.2 and INR 1.3.  His chemistry 7
was as follows:  Sodium 143, potassium 3.6, chloride 107, CO2
30, BUN 12 and creatinine 1.4.  His glucose was 161.  His
calcium was 8.8, magnesium 1.7 and phosphorus 1.9.  His total
bilirubin on this date was 0.9, AST 29, ALT 17 and alkaline
phosphatase 114.

Microbiology studies:  During the course of his stay, Mr.
[**Known lastname **] grew Enterobacter, enterococcus and Methicillin
resistant staphylococcus aureus from his sputum cultures.

Urinalysis: Mr. [**Known lastname **] [**Last Name (Titles) 3780**] the presence of
eosinophils on his urinalysis from [**9-7**].  Mr. [**Known lastname **] had an
EKG which showed sinus rhythm with occasional atrial
premature beats and left axis deviation.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  On [**8-12**] to [**8-13**] the patient was admitted to
the neurosurgical ICU for evacuation of his subdural
hematoma.  He subsequently had a subdural drain placed
followed by craniotomy membrane excision for evacuation of
the subdural hematoma.  For the craniotomy procedure Mr.
[**Known lastname **] was intubated and following this procedure, there was
difficulty extubating Mr. [**Known lastname **].  Each extubation attempt
initially in the neurosurgical ICU was associated with
agitation and episodic hypertension and tachycardia by Mr.
[**Known lastname **].  These episodic periods of agitation prevented his
extubation.  During that time he also developed fevers and
grew Enterobacter, enterococcus from his sputum.  In
addition, Mr. [**Known lastname **] on x-ray was noted to have pulmonary
edema and echocardiogram [**Known lastname 3780**] normal ejection
fraction.  In addition, Mr. [**Known lastname **] complained of right upper
quadrant pain during his time in the neurosurgical ICU.
Right upper quadrant ultrasound [**Known lastname 3780**] cholelithiasis
and cholecystitis, however, he was determined not to be a
surgical candidate and instead was treated with antibiotics
and pain medications.  Serial CT scans of Mr. [**Known lastname 9149**] head
read by the neurosurgical team [**Known lastname 3780**] stability of the
subdural hematoma and on [**8-29**] he was transferred to the
medical ICU for failure to wean from the ventilator and
episodic agitation and hypertension in addition to management
for his presumed Enterobacter and enterococcus pneumonia.
Following his transfer to the medical Intensive Care Unit,
Mr. [**Known lastname **] grew Methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus
from his sputum.  He was treated with Levofloxacin followed
by Zosyn and Flagyl and Ampicillin for 7 days respectively
for presumed GI infection related to his cholecystitis.
During the subsequent days, Mr. [**Known lastname **] was successfully
weaned from his ventilator and tolerated his trach collar
without requiring ventilatory support.  His pneumonia
improved with decrease in number of secretions and he was
diuresed with improvement in his pulmonary edema by x-ray.

Cardiovascular:  Mr. [**Known lastname **] [**Last Name (Titles) 3780**] episodes of
hypertension and tachycardia with occasional premature atrial
beats related primarily to his agitation.  He was placed on a
standing dose of Lisinopril 10 mg once a day and Metoprolol
12.5 mg [**Hospital1 **] with fairly good control of his blood pressure
except during periods of agitation.  He was not treated for
his intermittent atrial fibrillation as his blood pressure
remained stable throughout his stay in the medical Intensive
Care Unit.

Infectious Disease:  As mentioned above, Mr. [**Known lastname **] has been
treated with Levofloxacin for roughly a total of 20 days for
his pneumonia.  He is also being treated with Zosyn for a
total of 10 day course for the pneumonia.  In addition, he
received 7 days of Flagyl and 7 days of Ampicillin for
empiric coverage related to his cholecystitis.

GI:  For his MRSA, Mr. [**Known lastname **] received a percutaneous
enterojejunostomy tube on the [**7-8**] and has
tolerated tube feeds well without residual.  His
cholecystitis has been treated with antibiotics and pain
medications from which he has been weaned by the [**7-9**].

Neurologic:  As mentioned before, Mr. [**Known lastname 9149**] subdural
hematoma has been deemed stable by the neurosurgical team.
He continues to be delirious with episodic agitation,
gradually decreasing in duration, although he continues to be
agitated up to 3-4 times per day for up to an hour at a time
associated with hypertension and tachycardi
