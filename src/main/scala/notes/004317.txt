Pertinent Results:
[**2199-1-10**]  CXR: Subsegmetnal atelectasis is seen in the lingula.
Otherwise, no consolidation or edema is evident. The mediastinum
is distorted due to low lung volumes. The cardiac silhouette
similarly so, but remains likely top normal for size, accounting
for patient and technical factors. No effusion or pneumothorax
is noted. The osseous structures are unremarkable.

[**2199-1-16**] V/Q scan: Normal perfusion and ventilation scan.

Brief Hospital Course:
# Respiratory Failure: Pt with history of tracheobronchomalacia
and COPD presents with acute respiratory distress and then
failure. She recently had her Y-stent removed due to granulation
tissue occluding the stent. Possible worsening of her TBM
causing occlusion of her airways. Other possiblities include
pneumonia secondary to aspiration given cough/secreations on
BiPAP. Additionally, COPD/bronchospasm may be contributing to
her respiratory status.  Patient was intubated and sedated;
treated with broad coverage antibiotics, nebulizers and
steroids. She was subsequently seen by IP who felt that placing
new stent was not necessary at this time. Patient completed
course of vancomycin / Cefepime for 8 days, and with round the
clock inhalers. Patient was extubated without difficulty and
continued to improve. Sputum cultures, blood cultures remained
negative and no clear precipitant was found for this event.

At time of discharge, patient was maintaining oxygen saturation
of 98% on room air.
.
#. Hypotension / Blood pressure: Noted on admission, Likely
multifactorial in setting of PEEP, possible infection,
hypovolemia. Patient improved with above workup and quickly
became hypertensive as per her baseline. At time of discharge,
patient was initiated on all home medications.
.
#. Anemia: Pt. had down trending Hct over the course of her
admission from 36 down to 30. This was thought multifactorial
including critical illness with frequent phlebotomy. Her
admission Hct was also likely hemoconcentrated given her
subsequent drop in creatinine and Hct after fluid resucitation.
She should have B12, folate and iron studies as an outpt.

# Dizziness: Prior to discharge, the pt began complaining of
dizziness with with lateral head movement.  Orthostatics were
negative and neuro exam was remarkable for onset of dizziness
with R lateral head movement.  No nystagmus could be elicited.
The pt was started on meclizine PRN for peripheral vertigo and
instructed to follow up with her primary care doctor if her
symptoms did not resolve.
