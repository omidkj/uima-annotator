HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname **] is an 83-year-
old woman with a history of pulmonary embolism who was on
Coumadin who was status post a mechanical fall with loss of
consciousness. The patient was taking out the garbage when
she fell. She does not remember the incident but was found by
a neighbor and brought to [**Hospital6 2018**]. On examination, she was found to have a small left
subdural hematoma and an INR of 2.9, as well as a left
forehead laceration.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Positive for congestive heart failure,
hypertension, Parkinson's, stroke and pulmonary embolism.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Coumadin, Lasix, spironolactone,
Mirapex, Sinemet, Ocuvite and Xalatan.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  She denied any visual changes, speech
changes, chest pain, shortness of breath, nausea, vomiting,
diarrhea, bowel or bladder changes.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 96.8, blood pressure
138/61, heart rate 83, respiratory rate 18 with 100 percent
saturation on room air. She was alert and oriented times
three. Speech was fluent. She was appropriate. She followed
commands. Naming and repetition were intact. Extraocular
movements were intact. Pupils were four to two bilaterally
and brisk. Face was symmetric. Tongue was midline. She had
equal palate elevation. Motor exam showed her to be [**5-19**]
bilaterally in the upper and lower extremities. Sensation was
grossly intact bilaterally. Toes were downgoing bilaterally.
Reflexes were two plus bilaterally, biceps one plus at
brachioradialis, one plus at knee and ankle.

LABORATORY DATA:  At the time of admission, sodium 139,
potassium 4.6, chloride 102, bicarbonate 28, BUN 38,
creatinine 1.1, glucose 104, white blood cell count 5.1,
hematocrit 37.1, platelets 233, PT 21.3, PTT 34.0 and INR of
2.9. CKs were 83 and troponin was less than 0.01.

CT scan did show a left convexity, small subdural hematoma
and chronic small vessel disease.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  She was admitted to Neurosurgery in the
Neurology Surgical Intensive Care Unit. She was given fresh
frozen plasma to reverse her INR with a goal to be less than
1.3. Her systolic blood pressure was maintained at less than
140s. She was monitored with every one hour neurologic
checks. She was also seen in evaluation by the Trauma team
who cleared her cervical spine both by CT scan and
clinically. It was also requested that she be seen by
Hematology for question of an inferior vena cava filter now
that she could no longer have Coumadin. As her pulmonary
embolism was greater than six years ago, they feel that she
was adequately treated and did not need an inferior vena cava
filter or further Coumadin treatment. They did recommend
subcutaneous heparin for deep venous thrombosis prophylaxis
which was started. She was followed with repeat head CTs
which were stable. She was found to have a hematocrit drop to
26.4 on [**2117-12-25**] and did receive two units of packed red
blood cells for this. A post transfusion hematocrit came up
to 31.4 and remained stable. She continued to do well and was
transferred to the floor on [**2117-12-27**]. She was seen by both
Physical Therapy and Occupational Therapy to assess need for
possible rehabilitation placement before returning home.
Plans are unknown for discharge. An addendum will be
dictated.
