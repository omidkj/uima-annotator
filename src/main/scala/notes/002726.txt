Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 8810**]
Chief Complaint:
shortness of breath, fever

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Chest tube placement

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 24735**] is a 63 y/o M with a history of AML s/p allo SCT
[**10/2144**], chronic GVHD (liver, skin, ?lung) on prednisone and
cyclosporine who presents from home with fever and worsening
shortness of breath after bronchoscopy/biopsy on the day prior
to admission. He reports that there were no immediate
complications following the procedure. The next morning, the
patient reports worsening dyspnea and the onset of fever. Per ED
report, the patient's wife also reports that he has had altered
mental status on the day of admission.
.
Of note, the patient was recently seen by pulmonary in
consultation for daily productive cough over at least five
months.  He was prescribed moxifloxacin for ten days after a CT
chest ([**2146-8-30**]) demonstrated mosaic ground-glass attenuation
with bronchiectasis throughout and in left lower lobe a
tree-in-[**Male First Name (un) 239**] pattern also notable for a lingular consolidation
(pulmonary read). There was also diffuse mosaic attenuation
affecting small airway obstruction and the thought that this
could be a transplant-related bronchiolitis obliterans.  The
patient completed the moxifloxacin without change in his
respiratory symptoms.  He subsequently underwent bronchoscopy
with transbronchial biopsy on the day prior to admission.
.
In the ED inital vitals were, 120 25 97% on NRB 156/86. Exam
significant for diffuse rhonchi throughout, alert and oriented
to person place and month but easily distractible and answers
questions slowly. Labs were significant for Na 125, WBC 13.4,
lactate 2.6. Chest x-ray revealed large left pneumothorax
without mediastinal shift. A 28 French chest tube was placed in
the ED, and
repeat chest x-ray showed lung re-expansion, with the chest tube
curving inferiorly. Patient was given vancomycin, zosyn,
azithromycin (BAL from [**10-19**] showing Moraxella Catarrhalis, G+
cocci in pairs and chains, and G- diplococci). He recived
fentanyl 250 mg IV X 1 during the chest tube insertion. He was
also given stress dose Solu-Medrol 125 mg IV X 1.
.
On arrival to the ICU, the patient reports improvement in his
breathing, he is A+OX3. Denies any SOB, cough, sputum.


Past Medical History:
1. AML s/p allo SCT D+105:
- [**3-/2144**]: presented to [**Hospital **] hospital with fatigue and
weakness. His Hgb was 4.9, WBC 14.8 (16% neutrophils, 2%
bands,26% lymphocytes, and 55% monocytes). BMBx was notable for

a population of monoblasts and promonocytes which appeared to
approach 20%. He was diagnosed with AML-M5. Cytogenetics were
notable for +8.
- initially treated with 7 and 3 (idarubicin and ARA-C, however,

day 14 marrow showed persistent blasts. He was enrolled in the
randomized trial of HiDAC with or without clofarabine and began

treatment on [**2144-4-27**]. This course was c/b fevers to 105, rashes,

LFTs 300s.
- [**2144-6-23**]: Bone marrow showed a mildly hypercellular erythroid

dominant bone marrow with no morphologic evidence of leukemia.
- [**2144-8-17**]: received single cycle Dacogen due to donor issues
- [**2144-11-5**]: started reduced intensity conditioning with
Fludarabine-Busulfan and ATG. Day 0 was [**2144-11-12**]. He received
one bag CD34/kg x 10e6= 8.40. His post-transplant course was
uncomplicated with the exception of a mild transaminitis. He was

discharged to the apartments on Day +14.
