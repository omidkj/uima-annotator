Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2901**]
Chief Complaint:
dyspnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
1. Cardiac catheterization [**2163-1-12**]
2. Cardiac stenting of left main coronary artery and right
coronary artery [**2163-1-12**]
3. Tunneled hemodialysis line placement [**2163-1-17**]

History of Present Illness:
Mrs. [**Known lastname **] is a 76 year old woman with CAD (S/p BMS to mid
LAD in [**2159**]), sCHF (EF 40%), PVD s/p R axillobifemoral bypass
with graft which the fem-fem is now occluded, carotid
endarterectomy x 2 on the left last in [**2158**], s/p SMA PCI, COPD
(on 2L NC), PEs on coumadin who presents intubated/sedated from
[**Hospital3 **] in setting of acute pulmonary edema,
respiratory failure, oliguric [**Last Name (un) **], and critical left main
disease.
.
Patient was transferred from [**Hospital3 1443**] Hospital.  She
had recently been discharged after treatment of pneumonia
(unknown antibiotic course), and while at home in days after
discharge, developed progressive dyspnea and possible fever.
She denied sputum production or cough.  BNP on admission was
1000, up from 600 during previous admission for pneumonia.  She
was started on Zpack, ceftriaxone, and levofloxacin for
pneumonia/COPD exacerbation, and given IV lasix 20mg tid for
pulmonary edema.  She does not take lasix as an outpatient.  She
was noted to have a Cr of 1.4 on admission, which rose to 4.8
with diuresis.  Lasix was discontinued and renal consult was
obtained, who recommended stopping lasix, giving IVF for
pre-renal azotemia, and changing levofloxacin to ampicillin.
She was also found to have an enterococcus UTI and started on
unasyn.  ID and heme/onc consultations were obtained for
leukocytosis 19 with left shift.  Both agreed that leukocytosis
was likely reactive, but to treat pneumonia and UTI, and to
follow-up with outpatient records.  Patient does have chronic
leukocytosis and thrombocytosis noted during prior admission to
[**Hospital1 **] as well.  Per heme/onc consultation at that time, pattern
appeared less likely to be MDS, more likely to be reactive,
possibly related to iron deficiency as well.  Patient was
initiated on HD 4 days prior to transfer, received third run of
HD today, during which she developed acute left-sided chest
pain, [**8-31**], not radiating.  She developed severe respiratory
distress, was intubated, had then noted to have new
inferiorlateral ST depressions on her EKG (I and aVL and V6)
then goes to cath lab where they find 90% LM, 70% RCA, but no
interventions were performed.
She was transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] CCU for further management.
.
Unable to obtain ROS as patient is intubated.

TTE [**2163-1-9**]:
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. LV systolic function appears moderately-to-severely
depressed (ejection fraction 30 percent) secondary to akinesis
of the septum and hypokinesis of the anterior free wall,
inferior free wall, and lateral wall. Contractile function of
the posterior wall appears preserved. Right ventricular chamber
size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets
are mildly thickened (?#). The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The left ventricular inflow pattern
suggests impaired relaxation. The tricuspid regurgitation jet is
eccentric and may be underestimated. There is mild pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a
prominent fat pad.
