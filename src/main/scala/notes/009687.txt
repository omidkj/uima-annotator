Service:   C-Med

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 52-year-old
male with past medical history significant for multiple
admissions for substernal chest pain.  The patient was
initially seen in Montreal in [**2164-11-1**] while on vacation
for complaints of substernal chest pain and had a cardiac
catheterization which revealed clean coronaries and CPK and
troponins which were negative.  Ejection fraction at that
time was measured at approximately 30%.  The patient left AMA
and was readmitted later that month to [**Hospital1 190**] on the C-Med service for recurrent substernal
chest pain.  A TEE was done which showed an EF of
approximately 15-20% and there was presence of a left atrial
thrombus.  The patient had a fixed anteroapical inferolateral
and septal defect at that time.  The patient has most
recently had three serial admissions over the course of
[**2165-1-1**] for recurrent substernal chest pain.  CK and
troponin continued to be negative throughout.  A TEE was done
again on [**2165-1-7**] at [**Hospital1 69**] which
again showed his EF to be approximately 15-20%.  There was a
dilated left atrium but there as no evidence of thrombus.
There was a dilated right atrium, dilated left ventricle and
depressed left ventricular systolic function, 2+ MR, 2+ TR
and normal right ventricular function.  The patient was in
atrial fibrillation at the time and cardioversion was done on
[**1-7**].  On [**1-11**] in the morning the patient called EMS for
complaints of shortness of breath.  The EMS notes show
respiratory rate of 30 and oxygen saturation of 99% but in
the Emergency Room the patient's O2 sat fell to 61% and chest
x-ray was consistent with CHF.  The patient was urgently
intubated in the Emergency Room and ruled out for PE by CTA.
The patient was admitted to the CCU initially for Swan and
management of CHF.  The patient received 60 mg of Lasix,
Aspirin 325 mg in the Emergency Room.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1) History of Cocaine use back in the
[**2143**]'s.  2) History of alcohol abuse, also in the 80's.  3)
Cardiomyopathy.  4) Coronary artery disease, status post MI
times two, most recently in [**2161-9-1**] with cardiogenic
shock.  The patient had a stent to the LAD at that time.  In
[**2149**] the patient had an MI which was treated with TPA.  5)
Congestive heart failure, EF of 15-20%.  6)
Hypercholesterolemia.  7) AICD placement in [**2162**] for V tach
and syncope.  This was performed at [**Hospital1 2025**].  8) Anxiety
disorder.

ALLERGIES:  Amiodarone causes pruritus.

MEDICATIONS:  On admission, Digoxin, Coumadin, Isosorbide
Dinitrate 10 mg po tid, Enalapril 20 mg po q d, Lipitor 40 mg
po q d, Paxil 80 mg po q d, Carvedilol 25 mg po bid,
Klonopin, Trazodone, Prilosec 40 mg po q d.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Significant for coronary artery disease.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Patient denied any current tobacco or
alcohol use.  Patient works in the pizza business.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs show heart rate of 76,
blood pressure 89/63, O2 saturation 100% on SIMV 650/25 100%
FIO2 with 5 of pressure support and 5 of PEEP.  In general
the patient is an intubated and sedated middle aged male.
HEENT shows mucus membranes to be dry, the upper lip is
bloody, the extraocular movements are intact.  Pupils are
equal, round and reactive to light.  The lungs have diffuse
rales bilaterally, left greater than right.  The heart has a
regular rate and rhythm, there was a 2/6 systolic ejection
murmur.  The abdomen was soft, nontender, non distended,
there were normoactive bowel sounds.  There was no rebound or
guarding.  Extremities are without clubbing, cyanosis or
edema.  The pulses are 2+ in the left lower extremity and 1+
in the right lower extremity.  The neuro exam is grossly non
focal.

LABORATORY DATA:  On admission show a white count of 13.1,
hematocrit 34.7, platelet count 278,000, sodium 142,
potassium 4.4, chloride 105, CO2 19, BUN 20, creatinine 1.4,
glucose 210, INR 3.1, PTT 31.2, Dig level on the 10th was
0.8.  CK is 316 with MB of 2, troponin less than 0.3, tox
screen is positive for Benzo.

RADIOLOGY:  Chest x-ray shows an ICD in place, there was mild
to moderate congestive heart failure.  CTA shows basilar
ground glass opacities with septal thickening.  There was no
evidence of pulmonary embolus.

EKG showed a tachy/atrial rhythm.  The patient is V paced.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the CCU for
Swan and for management of CHF.  He ultimately never had the
Swan placed but was empirically diuresed while in the CCU
with improvement in his oxygenation status.  He also was
started on Ceftriaxone for a presumed pneumonia given a
sputum gram stain which showed 3+ gram positive cocci in
pairs and chains.  The patient's ventilator was weaned on the
second hospital day with hope of extubation, however, when
his pressor support was decreased to 10, his respiratory rate
increased into the 40's and he became agitated, therefore his
pressure support was again increased to 15.  He was
successfully extubated on the third hospital day and
transferred out to the C-Med service for further management.
At that time he had fully ruled out for MI with negative
enzymes.  He clinically was dry on exam, chest x-ray no
longer showed pulmonary edema.  He was oxygenating well.  The
Ceftriaxone was discontinued as the final sputum culture only
grew oral flora and there was never a definite infiltrate on
chest x-ray.  The patient had cardiac catheterization on
[**2164-1-15**] which showed normal coronaries.  Aldactone was added
to the patient's other medications for his severe congestive
heart failure.  He was to follow-up with his physician at [**Name9 (PRE) 2025**]
for possible heart transplantation in the future for his
severe cardiomyopathy.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Stable.

DISCHARGE FOLLOW-UP:  The patient is to follow-up with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] at [**Hospital3 2576**] [**Hospital3 **] for possible transplant
options on [**2165-1-15**].

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  Enalapril 20 mg po q d, Paxil 80 mg
po q d, Digoxin 0.125 mg po q d, enteric coated Aspirin 325
mg po q d, Prilosec 40 mg po q d, Lasix, Carvedilol 25 mg po
bid, Trazodone, Ditropan, Aldactone 25 mg po q d, Coumadin,
Isordil 10 mg po tid.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Congestive heart failure.
2.  Cardiomyopathy.
3.  Respiratory failure.
