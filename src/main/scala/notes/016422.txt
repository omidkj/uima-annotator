Admission Date:  [**2171-11-25**]     Discharge Date:  [**2171-12-12**]

Date of Birth:   [**2102-12-5**]     Sex:  F

Service:  MICU [**Location (un) **]

HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 68-year-old
female with a history of hypertension and diabetes
transferred from [**Hospital3 **] Hospital with worsening
hypoxia, hypotension.  The patient originally presented with
symptoms of cough and congestion since early [**Month (only) 359**].  The
patient had been treated symptomatically and went on a cruise
to [**Country 6607**] in early [**Month (only) 359**].  Upon return, she saw her primary
care physician due to persistent cough and malaise also with
productive sputum, sweats, and a fever to 101.  She was found
to have an oxygen saturation in the high 70s.  A chest x-ray
revealed bilateral lower lobe infiltrates.

She was admitted to the hospital and treated with Unasyn and
Azithromycin.  The patient's oxygen saturation improved to
94% and she was discharged around [**2171-11-15**] on a
course of levofloxacin.  At her follow-up appointment the
following week, the patient was again experiencing dyspnea
and also complaining of diarrhea and persistent fevers.  She
was again found to have oxygen saturations in the 70s and the
patient was readmitted.

Throughout her hospital course at the outside hospital, the
patient had an increasing oxygen requirement.  Chest x-rays
and chest CTs were consistent with bilateral basilar
infiltrates and also patchiness in the upper lobes.  She was
transferred to the MICU with increasing hypoxia.  She was
also noted to have new atrial fibrillation and she was
started on Lovenox for anticoagulation.  She experienced
decreased oxygen saturations and was intubated for
respiratory failure prior to transfer to the [**Hospital3 **]
Hospital.

The patient was transferred to the Medical Intensive Care
Unit at [**Hospital6 256**].  At the time of
arrival, she was intubated and hypotensive and was started on
pressors upon admission.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Hypertension.
2.  Diabetes.
3.  Hypercholesterolemia.
4.  Irritable bowel.
5.  Allergic rhinitis.
6.  History of diverticulitis.
7.  History of positive PPD.
8.  Status post TAH/BSO.
9.  Status post cholecystectomy.
10. Status post ORIF of the left ankle.
11. History of cataract surgery.

ALLERGIES:   Keflex, sulfa, Flagyl, Norvasc, and Demerol.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Vital signs:  Temperature
100.7, pulse 132, blood pressure 84/55, respiratory rate 19.
She was intubated, withdrawing to pain for stimuli,
intermittently agitated.  She was tachycardiac but regular,
normal S1, S2.  Lungs:  Decreased breath sounds at the bases
bilaterally and crackles also at the right base.  No
wheezing.  Abdomen:  Soft, nontender, with good bowel sounds.
Skin:  Notable for a right forehead bruise with a raised
ecchymotic area with swelling status post a fall at the
outside hospital.

LABORATORY/RADIOLOGIC DATA:  On admission, the patient's
white count was 14.5, hematocrit 33.

On admission, the chest x-ray showed bilateral pulmonary
process.

Chest CT was with extensive pneumonia bilaterally involving
the lower lobes and lower portions of the upper lobes.

Head CT was negative.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was treated with broad spectrum
antibiotics for presumed pneumonia.  The patient was also
treated with p.o. vancomycin due to persistent diarrhea.
However, all cultures obtained during the patient's admission
remained negative.  This included cultures from two pleural
taps as well as one bronchoscopy.  The patient remained
ventilated throughout her course.

The patient did show clinical improvement and around [**2171-12-9**] there were thoughts of weaning the patient with
possible extubation as she had been off pressors for three
days and had been afebrile for the prior two days.  Her
respiratory status was stable with good oxygenation.
However, just after this the patient's clinical course
declined.  She was again started on broad spectrum
antibiotics including the fact that she had been on acyclovir
for external HSV infection; however, she continued to
decline.  She had an increasing pressor requirement.  She
also developed elevated liver enzymes and acute liver failure
as well as acute renal failure becoming anuric.

As the patient continued to require pressor support and had
then developed evidence of bleeding as demonstrated by a
decreased hematocrit requiring blood transfusions, the
decision was made by the medical team and with the patient's
extensive family who were very involved in her care to
withdrawal pressor support on [**2171-12-12**].  Shortly
after withdrawal of pressor support, the patient became
asystolic and was declared.  The patient's family was
present.  The patient's family declined a postmortem
examination.
