Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 290**]
Chief Complaint:
dysphagia, chronic cough

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
EGD
Bronchoscopy

History of Present Illness:
77yo with no significant PMH with chronic cough x 2 months who
has been undergoing work-up by GI and Pulmonary for possible
neoplasm and TE-fistula, now being admitted for observation
after unsuccessful EUS re-look today.
.
Story starts in late [**Month (only) 216**], when she began devloping cough and
dysphagia for solids associated with intermittent sharp pains
radiating to the back as well as belching; she also notes having
anorexia. The cough was worked-up by her PCP with concerns for a
pulmonary infectious process; she underwent a course of
levofloxacin, a CXR, cardiac ECHO, and CT-Chest on [**10-7**] which
showed, among other findings, extensive mediastinal LAD and
ground glass opacities. She subsequently underwent GI work-up
with EGD in late [**Month (only) 359**] followed by the EGD today. Through this
interval, her symptoms have worsened and as a result of her
dysphagia and anorexia she has had an involuntary 20lbs weight
loss.
.
Findings from EGD today [**2104-10-30**]:
Esophageal/pleural fistula on EGD today.  Large cavitation seen,
to be fistulizing into lung, on endoscopy today.  Mucosa is
spared, unlike usually with Ca.  DDx: adenoCa (GI vs lung) on
differential, but could also be the reverse with GI penetrating
to the lung.
.
Previous EGDs:
[**2103-8-3**]
Large hiatal hernia
Polyps in the fundus
Small nodular raised lesion with possible erosion on top, no
stigmata or visible vessel noted in the duodenum
Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum
.
[**2103-9-11**]
A medium size hiatal hernia was seen.
Multiple gastric polyps seen in the fundus and body
A small nodular submucosal lesion was seen in the duodenal bulb
with a small central raised area. Two cold forceps biopsies were
performed using a jumbo forcep for histology.
A 0.6cm X 0.4cm sub-mucosal lesion was seen in the duodenal
bulb, originating from the muscular layer.
Differential diagnosis includes GIST, Leiomyoma, Sarcoma
.
[**2104-10-16**]
Tubular sub-epithelial mass / buldge in the upper third of the
esophagus.
Food impaction in the mid and lower esophagus - this was pushed
into stomach. Assessment of esophageal wall could not be made
due to debris coating esophageal wall.
(foreign body removal)
Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum
.
[**2104-10-16**]
Food in the lower third of the esophagus
Mass in the middle third of the esophagus
The food bolus was unable to be removed due to patient poor
tolerance of procedure with desaturation of O2. Patient will
need procedure with anesthesia
Otherwise normal EGD to lower third of the esophagus
.
CT Chest [**2104-10-7**]:
1. Widespread new compared to prior radiograph areas of
peribronchovascular ground-glass opacities. Differential
diagnosis would include cryptogenic organizing pneumonia,
vasculitis, infection (less likely). Given the lack of those
abnormalities on the recent chest radiograph, neoplasm is
unlikely.
2. Huge hiatal hernia containing most of the stomach. Most
likely loculated peritoneal effusion at the level of the hiatus
as described.
3. Extensive mediastinal lymphadenopathy including right upper
paratracheal area, most likely reactive to the parenchymal
process.
4. Evidence of air trapping especially on the left that might be
related to narrowing of the left main bronchus by the large
hernia. Tracheomalacia is also suspected.
5. Bilateral pleural effusions, most likely secondary to the
parenchymal
process.
6. Small liver hypodense lesion, most likely cysts.

Reports:
CT abdomen/pelvis/chest ([**11-13**])

IMPRESSION:
1. Extensive esophageal mass abutting the pulmonary artery, left
atrium and aortic arch with circumferential thickening of the
esophagus and proximal air-fluid levels.
2. Extensive paraesophageal, mediastinal and hilar adenopathy.
3. Left upper lobe pulmonary nodule.
4. Right lower lobe pulmonary embolus
5. Liver metastases.
6. Metastatic retroperitoneal adenopathy.
7. extensive subcutaneous edema and gas formation within the
anterior
abdominal wall on left side in the region of the J-tube (series
301B image 59) concerning for gas-forming infection vs tube
leakage.

[**11-18**] abdominal tissue bx
Left abdominal wall:
Skin and subcutaneous tissue with focal fat necrosis and acute
and chronic inflammation.

[**11-23**] Head CT
No acute intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect. Partial
opacification of the mastoid air cells, which is new since the
prior study and may be related to recent intubation. MR can be
considered for better
assessment of parenchymal abnormalities related to
metastases/infarction, if not CI.
