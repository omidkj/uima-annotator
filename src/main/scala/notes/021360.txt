History of Present Illness:
53 yo female with a hx of AML s/p alloBMT from SD, HTN,
hyperlipidemia admitted for increasing shorteness of breath and
infiltrate on chest CT. Pt seen on [**4-28**] complaining of
increasing dry cough and shortness of breath despite a 12 day
course of azithromycin. It was felt that her cough was possibly
due to her chronic GVHD so her prednisone was increased from 20
to 30mg. She denied any fever or chills, SOB at rest, chest
pain, tightness, PND, orthopnea or LE edema. Shortness of breath
has been very slowly progressing over the past 2-3 months but
much worse over the past week. She reports wheeze which was
improved with her inhalers. She also had a chest CT on [**4-28**]
which showed left lower lobe infiltrate. Her dyspnea on exertion
continued over the week and after being seen in clinic today
with tachypnea decision was made for admission for further
workup.

Brief Hospital Course:
Shortness of breath-Infiltrate on chest CT was thought to
represent CAP although pt at risk for PCP and fungal PNA with
chronic immunosuppression. It was less likely viral in origin
with focal infiltrate. Nasal aspirate for RSV, influenza, and
paraflu were negative. Pt had bronchoscopy on [**2160-5-3**] which
revealed nl airways and sent for PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] viral panel, AFB,
bacterial and fungal GS and Cx as well as legionella Ag screen
although develped rt sided pneumothorax post procedure. Chest
tube was placed by CT [**Doctor First Name **] but she cont to have an air leak so
Heimlich valve was placed on [**5-11**]. SOB was not acute in nature
and no effusion seen on chest CT so CHF and PE were unlikely
although we obtained TTE which was normal. We initially started
her on levofloxacin to cover CAP and added vancomycin when GPC
seen on BAL but these were stopped on [**5-9**] since she was never
febrile and CXR's showed no infiltrate. We cont her on Px dose
bactrim since PCP DFA on bronchoscopy was negative. There was
thought to be a component of GVHD to her SOB with possible
bronchiolitis obliterans but we tapered her prednisone to 15mg
[**Hospital1 **]. There also appeared to be some airway inflammatory
component with wheezing so we cont on outpt inhalers with
addition of nebs. We treated her cough symptomatically with
robitussin with codeine and humified air. Aspergillis grew from
BAL and  voriconazole was started. Chest tube removed [**5-14**].
Dyspnea improved by time of discharge.
.
GVHD-Pt eye symptoms appeared worse per her report, although
unilateral nature suggested acute injury. We cont on outpt dose
mycofenolate and prednisone as above.
We cont artificial tears and outpatient vigamox and lotemax eye
drops, with tacrolimus lip balm.
.
HTN-Pt was hypertensive on admission so we changed carvedilol to
procardia XL with good response. Pt then became tachycardic of
unclear etiology although she is mildly hypoxic with known lung
disease and pain associated with chest tube. ECG revealed sinus
tach with TSH normal and will consider CTA as part of
tachycardia workup.

Aniety-Cont on outpt celexa and ativan prn

HSV-Pt has no oral lesions at this time but will cont famvir for
