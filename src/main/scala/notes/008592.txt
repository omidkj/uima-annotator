Brief Hospital Course:
68 year old white female S/P SAH clipping on the [**2103-4-25**]. She
had a ventricular drain placed in the right ventricle  She was
able to follow commands off propofol wiggling the toes, until
[**4-27**] where she was noted to not follow any commands but could
still move all four extremities spontaneously and symmetrically.
 A metabolic workup and repeat NCHCT was done that reportedly
showed no abnormalities except for new right caudate and
anterior corpus callosum hypodenisty. MRI brain on [**4-28**] did not
show any new infarcts.
EEG was done on [**4-29**] showed focal seizure activity/PLEDs over
the right fronto- central region. Patient was given 2 mg Ativan
and loaded with 1500 mg dilantin and continued on 100mg TID and
Keppra 500 mg [**Hospital1 **], and placed on a continues bedside EEG.
Repeat head CTA on [**2103-4-29**] demonstrated new evolving infarct on
caudate/anterior corpus callosum. Brainstem reflexes and
extensor posturing remained intact.
[**2103-5-1**] bedside EEG monitoring showed nonconvulsive status
epilepticus involving right > left lobes. Keppra/dilantin
increased due to status epilepticus on [**5-2**] per neurology.
[**2103-5-5**] patient condition complicated by PE/DVT anticoagulation
therapy instituted and ICV filter placed on [**2103-5-5**]. patient had
peg and trach placed on [**5-23**]. She had GI bleed on [**5-28**] and was
found to have bleeding from diverticulum on colonoscopy. she was
transfered to step down on [**5-29**]. She had serial head ct which
continued to show infarcts in the midline affecting the genu of
the corpus collosum and anterior cingulate cortices bilaterally.
She had an LP done on [**6-22**] which showed an opening pressure of
16. after discussion with the other neurosurgical attendings the
patient was preoped for the OR for  VP shunt. On [**6-27**] the
patient dropped her saturation levels, surgery was cancelled and
she was sent for ultrasound of her legs and CTA of chest to r/o
new PE and DVT's both tests were negative. Patient was seen by
medicine consult for management of sinusitis/klebsiella UTI/?
Pneumonia with bilat pleural effusions. Bactrim was used to
treat both UTI and sinusitis and they did not feel it was
necessary to treat for pnemonia. Neurologically she started
opening her eyes and tracking, and occassionally sticking out
her tongue to command. she remains on keppra/dilantin/phenobarb.
She was seen and evaluated by Dr [**First Name (STitle) **] the Behavior
neurologist who's recommedations have not been finalized.
Because of improving neurologic status the vp shunt will be
postponed until needed.  Beginning earlier in the week of the
[**4-7**], her neurological status as per nusring staff and
family members improved, such that she intermittently tracked,
responded with semi-purposeful movements to suctioning and
response ot pain.  She is considered stable for discharge to a
skilled rehab facility at this time.
