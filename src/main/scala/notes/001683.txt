A DFA returned positive and was started on tamiflu.  His IUC
course was signficant for IV solumedrol, antibiotics (7 days
azithromycin) and positive pressure ventilation.  He was
extubated [**5-10**] without complication, when his azithro stopped
also.  Finished day #[**6-18**] of tamiflu.  Was on 6 days of IV
solumedrol, now on oral prednisone.  In ICU, he did not require
