Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 618**]
Chief Complaint:
Right facial droop, left face and arm numbness


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
-Status post tracheostomy
-Status post PEG
-Status post dental extraction of 3 teeth

History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 56 year old right handed female with pastmedical
history of breast cancer 10-15 years ago, pleural effusion, DVT
and PE who presented to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2114-9-17**] for evaluation of left
face and arm numbness and right facial
droop.

Patient was in her usual state of health until about one week
ago when she reports having "the flu". She then had several days
of nausea and vomiting and malaise. Two days prior to admission
her daughter her right eye was "droopy". On evening prior to
admission, her whole right face was drooped. Then, on morning of
admission, she awoke at 6am with left arm and face numbness.
This
was associated with a vertiginous sensation as well. Daughter
noted that her speech was slurred. No nausea or vomiting,
headaches, blurry vision, double vision, lightheadedness,
paresthesias, weakness or incoordination. She went to [**Hospital1 56809**] for evaluation. Head CT there with pontine
hemorrhage.

Transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation. On initial arrival,
heart rate 70-80s and sinus, BP 138/90, oxygen 93/RA and 98%/2L.
While in ED, she received 2 units of FFP. However, she reported
that her symptoms worsened. She felt that her speech was more
slurred, she was having difficulty managing her saliva and
secretions, and had vertical diplopia. Repeat head CT showed
interval worsening in the size of her bleed, from 8-12 mm. While
in ED, she went into atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular
response; Diltiazem 20mg IV resulted in rate control.

After arrival to the neurology floor, she continued having
difficulty managing her secretions. On several occasions, her
oxygen saturation drooped into the 80s. She was transferred to
the ICU for closer monitoring. She received Factor VIIa. She was
electively intubated in early am on [**9-18**].

-----
CT head w/o contrast [**2114-9-17**]: A rounded hyperdensity is again
noted in the right pontomedullary junction. This is slightly
larger than on the prior study, now measuring 12 x 11 mm in
size. In addition, this extends slightly more superiorly into
the pons and slightly more inferiorly into the medulla. No new
areas of hemorrhage are identified. Streak artifact is again
identified within this area which limits evaluation of
surrounding edema. There is no mass effect or hydrocephalus.
[**Doctor Last Name **]-white matter differentiation remains preserved. The osseous
structures are normal.
-----
MRI head w/o contrast and MRA head [**2114-9-17**]: Multiplanar T1 and
T2W images of the brain was obtained. MRA of the Circle of
[**Location (un) 431**] was performed. Correlation is made to the CT examination
dated [**2114-9-17**]. As seen on the CT examination, there is
a small 1 cm lesion of increased T2 signal along the right
pontomedullary junction which demonstrates magnetic
susceptibility on gradient echo images suggestive of a small
cavernoma or a calcified lesion due to the increased density
seen on the CT exam and magnetic susceptibility. FLAIR images
demonstrate a similar but smaller lesion near the left middle
cerebellar peduncle. Additional evaluation of the brain with
Gadolinium enhanced MRI in both axial and coronal planes would
be recommended. The ventricular system is symmetrical without
hydrocephalus. The 4th ventricle is in the midline. There is
normal signal flow void within the intracranial portions of the
carotid and basilar arteries. MRA of the Circle of [**Location (un) 431**]
demonstrates patent distal vertebrobasilar circulation. No
aneurysms are seen along the posterior circulation. The
visualized anterior, middle, and posterior cerebral arteries are
patent. The exam is insensitive to detect tiny aneurysms less
than 3 mm in diameter.
-----
CT Chest, Abdomen, Pelvis [**2114-9-20**]:
CT OF THE CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST: There are multiple enlarged
lymph nodes in the left supraclavicular and prevascular regions,
the largest is in the left supravicular region measuring
approximately 12 x 19 mm. The patient is intubated. The trachea
and left main stem bronchi and its tributaries are widely
patent. There is obstruction within the central right airways
with complete opacification of the more distal airways and the
entire right lung. There is a mixed low and high attenuation
density of the collapsed right lung. There is a small loculated
effusion at the posterior inferior right thoracic cavity with a
thickened wall. The distal right main pulmonary artery is
obstructed. Posterior atelectatic changes are noted within the
left lung. At the superior aspect of the superior segment of the
left lower lobe there is a pleural based nodular density
measuring approximately 6 x 10 mm. The patient is status post
right mastectomy and surgical clips are noted in the right
axilla consistent with lymph node dissection. A porta cath is
noted in the superior left chest wall.

CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST: The liver, pancreas, spleen,
adrenal glands, kidneys, ureters, and small/large bowel loops
are unremarkable. There is layering high attenuation material
within the gallbladder suggestive of layering sludge. There is
gallbladder wall thickening or gallstones. There is no
lymphadenopathy or free fluid.
