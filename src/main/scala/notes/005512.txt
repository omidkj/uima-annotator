Brief Hospital Course:
73 y/o woman presented to OSH in respiratory failure, intubated
(for less than 24 hours), diuresed, and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] on
[**2155-2-16**].  Cath revealed 2vCAD, Echo: EF 35%, 2+MR.  She remained
on the medical service, underwent the usual pre-operative
testing, and was taken to the OR on [**2155-2-21**].  She was taken to
the CSRU on Neo, Epi and propofol gtts.  She weaned from the
ventilator and was extubated the evening of surgery.  She then
had an episode of severe coughing, after which she dropped her
BP, and had sudden increase in chest tube output.  After
emergent reintubation, an open chest resuscitation was
initiated.  A bleeding site was identified and repaired, and her
chest was subsequently closed.
Over the next few days, she remained somewhat hypotensive,
requiring pressors and inotropes.  Her renal status
deteriorated, the renal medicine service was consulted, and CVVH
was initiated.  After discontinuation of sedation, she remained
unresponsive.  A neurology consult was obtained due to continued
decreased level of responsiveness.  Their opinion was that she
had minimal brainstem function, with a very poor prognosis for
any meaningful neurologic recovery.  This was discussed with the
family by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on multiple occasions throughout the
course of the next few weeks.  The family wanted to continue
aggressive care despite the poor prognosis.  She developed
atrial fibrillation which was treated with amiodarone.  Her
vasopressors and inotropes were ultimately weaned off, and she
has remained hemodynamically stable.
She underwent tracheostomy, PEG, and tunnelled dialysis catheter
on [**2155-3-12**].  She remains on ventilator support, being tube fed,
and dialyzed 3x/week.  She is ready to be transferred to a long
term care facility.
