History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **] year old female with likely advanced gallbladder carcinoma,
vascular dementia, and CVA with subsequent aphasia who presents
with fever and productive cough at home.  She was recently
discharged directly from the ICU on [**2145-7-21**] after a one day
admission for respiratory distress in the setting of 7 days of
decreased PO intake, cough, and sputum production.  CXR on that
admission showed trace left pleural effusion but no clear
evidence of pneumonia or other acute intrathoracic process.  Her
respiratory distress resolved overnight, and she was weaned off
supplemental oxygen.  Her symptoms were thought to be related to
possible aspiration and difficulty clearing secretions.  During
her stay, she received Ceftriaxone and Levofloxacin, but was
discharged off antibiotics given the lack of clear evidence for
pneumonia.
.
Since her discharge, her daughter has noted continued altered
mental status compared to prior baseline.  The patient has not
been eating or drinking for almost a week.  At baseline she is
bed bound, and reportedly speaks sporadically, but this was not
observed during recent admissions.  She reportedly spiked fevers
soon after discharge and continued to have a cough and increased
secretions.  She was seen by her VNA the day after discharge and
by her visiting NP [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 4457**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 10686**] the day after that.  Per her
daughter, the patient has not had any nausea, vomiting,
abdominal pain, or diarrhea.  She was brought to the ED today
due to family concern regarding her cough and poor PO intake.
.
In the ED, initial vital signs were T 101.3, BP 162/64, HR 88,
RR 24, SpO2 100% on NRB, and FBG 151.  She triggered for
nonresponsiveness on arrival.  Labs showed WBC 17.7, trending
down slightly from prior admission, Hct stable at 32.4, Na 160
up from 146 on [**2145-7-21**], anion gap 18, bicarb 22, lactate 1.5,
creatinine 0.6 near baseline, and troponin <0.01.  UA showed no
evidence of UTI, though prior culture grew Enterococcus
~8000/ml.  CXR showed no acute process.  She was given
Vancomycin and Zosyn for possible pneumonia.  She also received
1000 ml normal saline.  She was admitted to the ICU for further
management.  Vitals prior to transfer were T 97.7, BP 144/67, HR
77, RR 22, SpO2 96% on 2L.
.
Once in the ICU, she remained minimally responsive and
nonverbal.  She did not appear to be in any respiratory distress
or discomfort.  The events of the last few days were confirmed
as above with her primary caretaker.

Brief Hospital Course:
[**Age over 90 **] year old female with likely advanced gallbladder carcinoma,
vascular dementia, and CVA with subsequent aphasia who presents
with fever and productive cough after recent discharge on [**2145-7-21**]
after being admitted for respiratory distress, likely due to
aspiration.
.
# Aspiration / Pneumonia: She is at high risk for aspiration
given her mental status.  On her prior admission, it was thought
that her respiratory distress was due to aspiration and
difficulty clearing secretions.  Based on her CXR and rapid
improvement, this was likely an aspiration pneumonitis rather
than pneumonia.  She was discharged without antibiotics and
spiked several subsequent fevers concerning for infection.
Repeat CXR the morning following admission showed possible
consolidation.  Sputum samples and other cultures were
unrevealing.  Her WBC count was elevated to 28.1 from her
baseline 15-17.  Given the likelihood of aspiration-associated
pneumonia in the context of prior treatment with ceftriaxone and
levofloxacin, she was started on antibiotic therapy with
vancomycin and Zosyn. Her respiratory status improved and
following 3 days of IV antibiotic therapy she was discharged
home with PO levofloxacin for a total 7 day course. This
medication can be crushed and delivered in food every other day.
.
# Leukocytosis: The most likely source of her increased
leukocytosis on presentation was thought to be aspiration
penumonia.  Other possible causes considered were UTI, C diff,
and hepatobiliary disease secondary to her underlying presumed
malignancy.  A urine cult
