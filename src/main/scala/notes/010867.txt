Seizures and altered mental status.

History of Present Illness:
[**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 13013**] is a 56-year-old right-handed man with history of
glioblastoma, staus post resection and VP shunt, who presented
on [**2103-2-6**] with seizures.  He has a history of a prolonged
hospitalization from [**2102-11-14**] to [**2102-12-7**], during which time he
was treated for Pnuemocystis pneumonia.  He also had pulmonary
embolism initially treated with LMWH and then with an IVC filter
following bleeding in his tumor bed, and suffered a PEA arrest
complicated by flail chest and prolonged intubation.  He also
developed C. difficile at [**Hospital1 **] [**Hospital1 **] and
continues on IV metronidazole and PO vancomycin in addition to
an ESBL pneumonia for which he was treated with IV vancomycin
and IV ertapenem (now on meropenem).

Of note, he had no previous generalized tonic-clonic seizures
prior to this admission (although seems he had a temporal lobe
seizure with secondary generalization at the time of his PEA
arrest back in [**Month (only) **]) but did suffer what sounds like
temporal lobe seizures before glioblastoma diagnosis, which
presented as recurrent uinidentifiable but horrible smells.  On
this admission, he suffered a 2.5 min tonic-clonic seizure at
his [**Hospital1 **] [**Hospital1 **] on [**2103-2-5**] and after
transfer to [**Hospital3 417**] Hospital ED on [**2103-2-6**] had a further
2-minute seizure.  At this point he was loaded with 1000 mg IV
phenytoin and 2 mg IV lorazepam and was post-ictal after this.
Head CT showed 4 mm leftward midline shift and a right insular
intraparenchymal hemorrhage (later found to be old) and due to
concern for these CT findings he was transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**].

In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, he underwent repeat head CT which was unchanged
and chest X-ray showed atelectasis but could not rule out
pneyumonia.  His mental status improved over his ED course.
Neurolgoy was consulted and recommended pursuing an infectious
workup with urinalysis and his valproic acid dose was unchanged
in dose but given via the IV route due to concern for aspiartion
and was admitted to neuro-oncology for further care.  He had no
further seizures and has passed [**Last Name (un) 8692**] Speech and Swallow
evaluation on [**2103-2-6**] a.m.  Per Neurology notes, his valproic
acid dose was seemingly increased but I see no record of this,
an EEG had also been recommended by his neuro-oncologist Dr.
[**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **] [**Initial (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 724**].
His mental status improved and per oncology has been oriented to
person and place with intermittent communication but now seems
much better and at baseline per his relatives.  [**Name (NI) **] triggered on
[**2103-2-6**] when he desaturated to 80% on 4L and had worsening
problems regarding [**Name2 (NI) 84003**] thick secretions improving with
vigorous suctioning and chest PT and regular nebulizers.  Chest
X-ray was relatively unchanged and indeed has been pretty
unimpressive sice admission with certainly no florid
consolidation to be seen.  He had no WCC response but is
immunosuppressed by long term steroids.  He was transferred to
the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for bronchoscopy wich required pre-procedure intubation
and IP noted copious ++ thick secretions on BAL which were sent
for atypical and atypical pathogens.  He was given propofol and
suxamethonium and plan is for transfer back to OMED once
stabilised and if his respiratory status is stable.  On review
post-extubation on the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], his [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] admission vitals were
temperature 98.2 F, pulse 89, blood pressure 117/90, respiration
24, and O2 saturation at 96% on 6L O2. On review he was on 4L O2
via NC and a shovel mask at 40% maintaining sats at 93%.  He
noted still very troublesome cough with copious secretions
although felt a bit better post bronchoscopy.  He was alert,
oriented and mentating well, wife felt he was at his baseline.
Otherwise patient noted lower sharp abdominal pain since
admission to [**Hospital1 **] (of not previosuly had pain due to his VP shunt)
and a 10-day history of severe right knee pain, neck pain since
admission and 2 weeks of lower back pain.  Of note, he had
limited mobility at rehabiltiation but had managed to use a
walker.

Review of Systems:
CVS - NO CP/SOB
RS - Cough ++ with sputum + no hemoptysis or wheeze
GIS - Nausea no vomiting, diarrhea 3x/day and some lower [**Last Name (un) 103**]
pain as above
[**Male First Name (un) **] - catheterised
CNS - no further fits, no numbness, weakness and reduced
mobility at baseline but not worse
ES - No fevers but does feel cold and no rigors
HS - No bleeding but bruises notable on abdomen but not new

Past Medical History:
Past Oncologic History:
- [**12-21**] developed headaches and leg weakness and CT at [**Hospital3 9683**] showed right temporal lobe mass.  Started on
dexamethasone. Underwent subtotal resection of the R temporal
lobe mass by Papavassilious on [**2101-12-30**], path positive for GBM
- received temozolamide chemo-radiation, followed by adjuvant
temozolomide (4 cycles)
- ventriculoperitoneal shunt placed [**2102-8-1**]
- started Procarbazine, CCNU, and Vincristine (PCV) on [**2102-8-23**]
- cycle 2 of PCV on [**2102-10-10**]
- prolonged hospitalization from [**2102-11-14**] to [**2102-12-7**], during
which time he had:
--Pneumoncystis pneumonia
--s/p PEA arrest and flail chest from compression
-- PE s/p IVC filter, was previously on lovenox
- he was discharged to NE [**Hospital1 **], and while there was diagnosed
with C. difficile, ESBL PNA
- plan was to treated with Avastin but this was delayed due to
ICH
Per wife has had 3 IC bleeds post craniectomy and as such has
meant that anticoagulation was contraindicated.
Per C. difficile, had been treated with a prolonged course of
oral antibiotics and had relapsed a few days post
discontinuation of treatment whereupon this was restarted.

Other Past Medical History:
Previous left knee cartilage operation

Social History:

healthy.
