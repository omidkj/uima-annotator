History of Present Illness:
The pt is a 84y/o F with a PMH of traumatic subarachnoid
hemorrhage, prior CVA with persistent speech, mixed valvular
disease with preserved systolic function, DM type 2, and atrial
fibrillation presenting with hypoxia. ? increased L sided
weakness from baseline. The patient was at her nursing home when
her daughter visited her at ~5pm on [**2107-2-23**]. She noticed her
mother [**Name (NI) 15598**]'t look well while she was being fed by one of the
staff. The daughter noticed that her face was angled funny and
her mother complained of right sided face pain. A few minutes
later the breathing became difficult. The daughter stated that
she then asked that her mother be transferred to the hospital.
.
The patient was recently admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2107-2-3**] with
hypoxia, secondary to aspiration event. She required a MICU stay
with intubation due to worsening respiratory distress in the
setting of mucus plugging and lobar collapse treated with
bronchoscopy. Her presentation was ultimately attributed to
aspiration pneumonitis. At that time she also was noted to have
AF with intermittent RVR, and CHF with bilateral pleural
effusions. She was treated with aggressive diuresis, with
subsequent metabolic alkalosis diamox was added to furosemide.
Diltiazem was titrated, as well as Digoxin for HR control and
low dose lisinopril was also started. She was also treated with
a 7 course of ceftazidime for Pseudomonal UTI.
.
In the ED, initial vitals were T:98.2 HR: 72 BP: 139/59 RR: 24
O2Sat:100%NRB. Patient received Vancomycin 1gm IV, Zosyn, lasix
40mg IV X2. CXR demonstrated pulmonary edema and b/l effusions.
She was intially placed on CPAP given hypoxia and tachypnea
however following lasix she was weaned to 5L NC. Vitals prior to
transfer to medical floor: T 100.0, BP 132/46, HR 70, RR 29,
100% on 5L NC.
.
On arrival to the medical floor, the patient was sleeping
peacefully and looked at her baseline according to her daughter.
The patient's daughter stated that normally her mother does not
walk and rarely gets out of bed. She is able to have a
conversation but occasionally appears to hallucinate and talk to
people not in the room.
