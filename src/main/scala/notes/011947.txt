Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3705**]
Chief Complaint:
lower extremity weakness

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2125-1-22**]: cervical spine traction / [**Location (un) **] [**Doctor Last Name **] tongs
[**2125-1-26**]: C5/6/7 corpectomies and C4-T1 anterior fusion
[**2125-1-31**]: C3-T3 Posterior Fusion
[**2125-2-8**]:  Tracheostomy

History of Present Illness:
56 yo F with cervical myelopathy s/p extensive posterior
decompressive laminectomy C3-C7, foraminotomy 3 years prior with
progressive leg weakness and increased falls over several
months. She had recent admission for similar complaints in
[**Month (only) **] and underwent cervical MRI but left AMA for financial
reasons. Since that time, her condition has worsened. At home,
she has minimal
ability to ambulate and has been using wheelchair at home
intermittently since [**Month (only) **] of last year.  She continues to
have moderate-severe neck pain as well requiring opioids.
She was readmitted to [**Hospital1 **] on [**2125-1-16**] at which time her
neurodiagnostics were reevaluated. On further review, there was
question of a fibrous scarring band at C5-C6 that might be
acting as a compression anchor on the cord. NSurg also felt that
she had pathologically brisk reflexes and upgoing toes b/l and
recommended repeat MRI cervical spine w/ contrast (report not
available). Neurology and Nsurg noted edema around cord at
C6-C7. Recommended IV steroids and continued neck brace as well
as transfer to [**Hospital1 18**].
Pt wears soft C-collar at all times and requires significant
pain medication (percocet, flexeril, vistaril). She is noted to
be a 1-assist to commode with unsteady gait.

Pertinent Results:
[**1-23**] C-spine Xray: HISTORY: Spondylolisthesis in traction.
7 AP and lateral radiographs of the cervical spine show little
change in the appearances including the grade 3 anterolisthesis
with deformed C6 body on C7 since exam [**2125-1-19**].

[**1-24**] C-spine Xray:
This is the second of four similar radiographs of the cervical
spine obtained over 14-hour interval. The grade 2
anterolisthesis of C6 on C7 and grade [**12-11**] anterolisthesis of C4
on C5 are little changed allowing for differences in rotation.

[**1-24**] C-spine Xray: The patient is status post posterior fusion
spanning C3-C6. There is again seen grade II anterolisthesis of
C4 over C5 which measures 9 mm and is stable. There is also
anterolisthesis of C6 over C7, which measures 11 mm and is also
relatively stable. Degenerative changes with loss of
intervertebral disc height at multiple levels is seen. There is
sclerosis of the C7 vertebral body. Overall, there has been no
appreciable change.

[**1-24**] C-spine Xray:
Single side lateral film of the cervical spine shows posterior
fusion hardware extending from C3 through C6. There is osseous
anterior fusion of C2 and C3 as well as C5 and C6. There is a
grade 2 anterolisthesis of C4 on C5 and C6 on C7 with appearance
unchanged from similar bedside exam 23 minutes earlier.

[**1-25**] portable chest Xray: No significant changes since prior
study. Lungs are well expanded and clear bilaterally. There is
no pleural effusion, masses or lesions.  There is no
pneumothorax. The cardiomediatinal silhouette is within normal
limits and stable. Pleural surfaces and osseous structures are
unremarkable.

[**1-26**] CT cervical Spine: IMPRESSION:
Limited study due to streak artifact from hardware demonstrates
new
anterior cervical discectomy and fusion from C4 to T1. Expected
postoperative changes.

[**1-29**] Chest Xray: As compared to the previous radiograph, there
has been a cervical fusion. There is no evidence of pneumonia or
other pathologic changes in the lungs. Unchanged mild symetrical
apical thickening. Normal size of the cardiac silhouette. No
pleural effusions, no pneumothorax.

[**1-30**] Lower extremity doppler US: no evidence of DVT

[**1-31**] CT C-spine-
1. C4-T1 anterior and C3-T3 posterior fusion. Increasing
