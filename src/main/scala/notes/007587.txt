History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 18473**] is a 45 year old male with PMHx significant for
lupus, ESRD on hemodialysis (Tues/Thurs/Saturday) awaiting renal
transplant, and congestive heart failure secondary to severe
mitral regurgitation, who was recently admitted for shortness of
breath and chest pain with flat cardiac enzymes. During his last
admission his shortness of breath was attributed to his mitral
regurgitation and chronic renal failure. He was evaluated by
cardio-thoracic surgery and was found to be a surgical
candidate; however he left before complete evaluation given his
mother's death. He subsequently presented to the ED with
worsening dyspnea and shortness of breath at rest.  Has had
multiple admissions for same complaints. Patient stated that he
had severe orthopnea. His chest pain was unchanged for the past
several months. He was subsequently admitted for management of
dyspnea and workup for mitral valve surgery.

Pertinent Results:
Chest CT Scan [**2174-10-27**]:
Moderate nonhemorrhagic layering left and small nonhemorrhagic
layering right pleural effusions. Associated left greater than
right bibasilar opacification, likely atelectasis. Moderate
cardiomegaly.

TEE [**2174-11-1**]:Conclusions
PREBYPASS
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. The left
ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. Regional left
ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). [Intrinsic left
ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the
severity of valvular regurgitation.] The right ventricular
cavity is mildly dilated with borderline normal free wall
function. The descending thoracic aorta is mildly dilated. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. Moderate (2+)
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
moderately thickened. The mitral valve leaflets do not fully
coapt. Severe (4+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Moderate [2+]
tricuspid regurgitation is seen.

POSTBYPASS
The patient is receiving epinephrine infusion at 0.3 ucg/kg/min

LV systolic function is borderline in the setting of inotropes.
RV systolic function now appears normal. There is a ring
prosthesis in the mitral position. Residual MR is now mild to
moderate. (1+-2+). The AI and TR are unchanged from prebypass.
The remaining study is unchanged from prebypass.

Cardiac Cath [**2174-10-28**]:
1. Coronary angiography in this right dominant system
demonstrated no
angiographically-apparent flow-limiting stenosis. The LMCA was
patent.
the LAD had a mid 30% stenosis and a 40% D1. The LCX was patent.
The RCA
had a proximal 30% stenosis.
2. Resting hemodynamics revealed elevated right and left sided
filling
pressures with RVEDP 13 mmHg and LVEDP of 22 mmHg. Thre was
moderate
pulmonary arterial systolic hypertension with PASP of 58 mmHg.
The
cardiac index was preserved at 2.9 l/min/m2. There was normal
arterial
systolic and dyastolic pressures at the aortic level 98/64 mmHg.
3. Left ventriculography was deferred.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr [**Known lastname 18473**] was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2174-10-16**] for evaluation
of Mitral Valve replacement. His preoperative workup included
tooth extraction by OMFS. Cardiac cath revealed no obstructing
coronary lesions. Renal was consulted as Mr.[**Known lastname 18473**] has end
stage renal disease, is hemodialysis dependent and is awaiting
transplant.

On [**2174-11-1**] he was taken to the operating room and underwent
Mitral valve repair with mitral valve annuloplasty with a 30-mm
Physio II annuloplasty ring and a
mitral valve commissuroplasty with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]. Cardiopulmonary
Bypass time= 79 minutes. Cross Clamp time=46 minutes. Please
refer to operative report for further surgical details. Of note,
his tunnel line catheter was noted to be  displaced while
prepping. It was sutured down for protection. He tolerated the
procedure well and was transferred to the CVICU intubated and
sedated. He awoke neurologically intact and weaned to
extubation. He was weaned off inotropic and pressor support and
ultimately started  diuresis.Postoperative heart block was noted
and Beta-blocker held. POD#1 he was started on CVVHD secondary
to hyperkalemia and volume removal. With improving hemodynamic
stability CVVHD was converted to hemodialysis. Steroids were
resumed for his SLE. Anticoagulation was resumed for atrial
fibrillation. All lines and drains were removed per protocol.

POD#3 he was transferred to the step down unit for further
monitoring. Multiple attempts to gain access via IR/Transplant
team were attempted and thwarted by the patient. A temporary
groin catheter was placed and HD was resumed. During this time,
anticoagulation was held for placing indwelling catheter.
Mr.[**Known lastname 18473**] was placed empirically on antibiotics for temperature
spikes and was fully cultured.  A positive urine culture grew
Proteus while all other cultures are no growth to date.

[**11-15**] He was taken to the OR for IR tunnel line placement in his
right groin. Post procedure anticoagulation was resumed for SLE
as well as atrial flutter/line patency.
Physical Therapy was consulted for evaluation of strength and
mobility. On [**11-16**], a portion of his sternal wound was opened at
bedside for developing drainage. He was placed on IV vanco and
cefepime x 2 weeks per the recommendation of Infectious Disease.
On the day of discharge his ABx regimenwas simplified to vanco
and ceftaz with HD to comeplete a 2 week course. Wound cultures
had no growth at the time of discharge. He was cleared for
discharge to home with services on POD #17. All follow up
appointments were advised. Social work was following an
