History of Present Illness:
66 yo F critical AS (valve area 0.6), CAD s/p PCIx4, severe
diastolic CHF, severe pulmonary [**Hospital 2754**] transferred from [**Hospital **] with respiratory distress. She was in USOH until 1 day
PTA, when she devleoped SOB. EMS came and pt was able to walk
out of the house to meet them. Shw was given Nitro SL, lasix,
and oxygen by NRB en route to hospital and her respiratory
condition deteriorated. She was intubated in the ED, with ABG
7.01/60/83. She was given insulin gtt. She ws given ativan and
morphine for sedation when she became agitated and pulling at
tubes.

valve surgery. The pt is a Jehovah's witness, so she refuses
blood products. She started EPO in [**Month (only) 547**], with the plan to
optimize her for an elective aortic valve replacement

LMCA: patent
LAD: 90% mid
LCX: 90% ostial OM1 and thrombus after the stent
RCA: 80% mid after the stent
no stent placed, awaiting AVR/CABG.
RHC: CVP 19, PA 43/26. PCWP 24. CO 3.72 CI 2.41
.
COMMENTS:     1. Selective coronary angiography demonstrated
three
vessel coronary artery disease in this right dominant
circulation. The
LMCA was without angiographically apparent flow limiting
disease. The
LAD had a 90% stenosis in the mid vessel prior to the diagonal
branch.
The LCX circulation had a 90% stenosis at the ostium of the OM1
and
thrombus in and distal to the previously placed OM1 stent. The
OM2 was
without flow limiting disease. The RCA had a patent ostial stent
and had
an 80% mid RCA stenosis near the site of the previous PTCA.
2. Resting hemodynamics from right heart catheterization
demonstrated
elevated right and left sided filling pressures (RVEDP=19mmHg
and mean
PCWP=24mmHg). There was mild pulmonary arterial hypertension
present
(43/26). Cardiac output and index were mildly depressed at 3.7
L/min and
2.4 L/min/m2 respectively.
3. Left ventriculography was not performed due to elevated
filling
pressures.
4. PTCA of the previously placed OM1 stent using a 2.5mm balloon
with
excellent results (see PTCA comments).

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Elevated right and left sided filling pressures.
3. NSTEMI treated with PTCA of previously placed LCX-OM1 stent.
.
Cath [**2150-9-3**]:
COMMENTS:     1. Cardiogenic shock due to a combinatin of
Myocardial
infarction, myocardial ischemia, Severe AS and impaired LV
function.
2. Possibility of ongoing ishchemia from the LAD an the RCA
lesions.
3. Critical clinical state due to above and other co-morbities
3. Issues with blood transfusions as patient is a Jehova's
witness.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Severe aortic stenosis.
3. Severe systolic ventricular dysfunction.
4. Successful PCI and bare metal stent placement on the LAD and
the RCA
with no complications


Brief Hospital Course:
A/P
66 yo F critical AS (valve area 0.6), CAD s/p PCIx4, severe
diastolic CHF, severe pulmonary [**Hospital 2754**] transferred from [**Hospital **] with respiratory distress and demand ischemia. During
hospitalization, recieved angioplasty x2. Plan is to consider
surgery for AVR.
.
1. Cardiac:
Coronaries:
On the evening of admission, the pt arrived at the CCU with ECG
not suggestive of acute infarct, the Cardiac enzymes were found
to be elevated, and in the setting of sudden onset of SOB,
hemodynamic decompensation, and known h/o CAD, this was assessed
as concerning for acute infarct, pt was sent emergently to the
cath lab. In cath lab, pt was found to have 3 vessel dz with 90%
OM1, no thrombus. This lesion was ballooned, not stented with
the plan for possible AVR/CABG. After discussions with CT
surgery, the decision was made to return to cath for stenting
to LAD and RCA on [**9-3**]. There were no complications. The pt was
extubated a couple of days prior to disharge. She was
hemodynamically stable and tranferred out of CCU for one day of
additional monitoring.
.
Pump/:
The pt arrived on decompensated heart failure likely [**1-28**] acute
MI on top of chronic severe AS. The pt required mechanical
ventilation and diuresis for the first week of hospitalization.
Right heart cath confirmed elevated filling pressures, PCWP 24
CVP 19. BB, ACE were held during the hospitalization because the
blood pressure could not tolerate. Plan is to consider valve
surgery for critical AS. This decision is complicated by the
patient's status as a Jehovah's Witness, she will not accept
blood transfusion.
.
Rhythm:
Sinus rhythm.
.
2. MRSA PNA:
The pt had a fever to 101 and a WBC 19.3 on admission. She was
required mechanical ventilation for prolonged respiratory
failure for the first week in the hospital. This was related to
decompensated heart failure and MRSA PNA. She completed a course
pf empiric antibiotics for MRSA PNA.
.
3. GI bleed:
NG tube was guaiac positive, with small coffee grounds initially
at CCU. After the first hour, the NG lavage showed no gross
blood.
-follow crit. follow NG lavage for blood.
.
4. diabetes:
the pt was managed with RISS. She will resart her home NPH
regimen as an outpatient.
