Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 43784**]
Chief Complaint:
Fever, abdominal pain, sreosanguinous wound discharge

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Reexploration and irrigation of abdominal incision

History of Present Illness:
This patient is a 34-year-old
female who underwent a supracervical hysterectomy and left
salpingectomy on [**2142-12-3**]. She was discharged home on
[**2142-12-5**]. She presented to the office on [**2142-12-6**]
complaining of watery drainage from her incision. Her wound
was opened and a moderate amount of serous fluid was drained.
Her wound was packed and she was arranged to have visiting
nurse visits for wound dressings at home. On [**2142-12-7**], the
patient felt well, however, on [**2142-12-8**] she presented to
the emergency room at [**Hospital3 1443**] Hospital with
abdominal pain and some vomitting. Abdominal CT scan showed
some dilated loops of small bowel suggesting a small bowel
obstruction and she was noted to have copious watery drainage
from her incision. There was concern for possible wound
dehiscence and so she was transferred to the emergency room
on the [**Hospital Ward Name 517**] of [**Hospital1 **] Hospital. While at
[**Hospital3 1443**] Hospital, pt received up to 22mg Morphine
sulfate for pain management.

On her initial assessment at emergency room at [**Hospital1 **], it was
difficult to examine her, and because of the watery discharge,
surgical consult was obtained.  Recommendation was made for
exam under anaesthesia. It was felt appropriate to take this
patient back to the operating room for wound exploration under
anesthesia to get adequate assessment and ensure fascia is
intact and to rule out dehiscence.  The appropriate consent
was obtained and she was taken to the operating room.

CT Abd/Pelv [**12-8**]
IMPRESSION:
1. Findings consistent with a small-bowel obstruction with
transition point in the right lower quadrant.
2. Bibasilar dependent atelectasis.
3. Stranding and superficial gas within the patient's known
[**Last Name (un) 22790**] incision. Small amount of phlegmonous change/fluid
is demonstrated along the left aspect of the wound. Underlying
infection cannot be excluded. No drainable collections or
protrusion of bowel is identified.

CXR [**12-8**]
The ET tube tip is in satisfactory position, approximately 2.6
cm above the carina. An NG tube is present, tip over fundus.
There are dense diffuse bilateral alveolar infiltrates with air
bronchograms.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was taken to the operating room on [**12-8**] for
exploration of surgical incision and placement of wound vacuum.
See operative report for details. The procedure was complicated
by hypoxia following extubation requiring reintubation and ICU
admission.  The remainder of her post operative course is as
follows.

Respiratory failure - her respiratory complications were thought
to be multifactorial in etiology with underlying asthma,
obesity, tobacco use, and possible obstructive apnea, in the
setting of two intubations within a week.  She had no evidence
of cardiac etiology with normal echocardiogram.  These findings
were also not consistent with pulmonary embolism.  She was
initially treated for presumed pneumonia with levofloxaxin.  She
remained afebrile after antibiotics were discontinued.  Serial
chest x-rays showed persistant consolidation in the lower lung
fields R>L, however, these were attributed to atelectasis.  She
remained without cough, fever, or leukocytosis.  She remained
intubated for 4 days post operatively. She was seen by the
pulmonary service who recommended outpatient evaluation with
repeat CXR and sleep studies.

Wound care - she was followed by the general surgery service for
management of her wound vacuum.  Her inicision continued to heal
well and she will continue with outpatient wound care with wet
to dry dressings and wound vac.  She had no evidence of wound
infection.

Partial small bowel obstruction - A nasogastric tube was placed
and remained for 5 days post operatively.  She had signs of
clinical improvement. Her diet was advanced and she had normal
bowel movements and flatus and no further nausea or distention.

Post operative pain - the patient was followed by the pain
medicine service for management of post operative pain in the
setting of prior narcotic tolerance.  She was well managed on
morphine PCA and then oral dilaudid.  She will have pain
medications prescribed by her PCP as an outpatient.
