LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION:  White blood count 16.2,

PTT 26.6.  Sodium 140, potassium 4.3, chloride 100,
bicarbonate 27, BUN 9, creatinine 0.7, glucose 137.  CK #1
61, troponin less than 0.3.

Arterial blood gas with a pH of 7.06, pCO2 of 103, pO2 of
105, bicarbonate 31.

IMPRESSION:  Patient is a 68-year-old male with long standing
tobacco use likely with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
now exacerbation possibly with overlying congestive heart
failure admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for
further management.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  PULMONARY:  Patient was started on Albuterol and Atrovent
nebs as well as given a dose of Lasix in the Emergency
Department as well as IV Solu-Medrol 125 mg IV times one in
the Emergency Department and was started on C-PAP.  He was
transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit.  While there,
he was continued on nebulizers as well as IV Solu-Medrol with
significant improvement in his respiratory status with blood
gas returning to 7.39 with pCO2 down to 41 and pO2 at 99,
bicarbonate 26 within several hours of admission into the
Medical Intensive Care Unit.  The Solu-Medrol was switched to
Prednisone and the nebs were switched to p.r.n. then switched
to a MDI.

The following day the patient was transferred to the Medical
Floor where he was breathing significantly better.  He was
started on Erythromycin p.o. for antibiotic coverage for
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation and on
discharge patient is saturating at 95 to 96% on room air in
no respiratory distress.  He will be continued on a
Prednisone taper as an outpatient as well as Albuterol and
Atrovent MDIs.

2.  CARDIOVASCULAR:  Patient was noted to have rales on exam
and responded well to Lasix.  He was noted to have a
depressed ejection fraction on an echocardiogram that was
done on [**12-23**].  Ejection fraction was less than 20%
with global left ventricular hypokinesis.  Etiology at this
point is unclear, however it will warrant an outpatient
evaluation including possible work up for coronary artery
disease, however on admission, the patient was ruled out for
myocardial infarction by enzymes with no events on Telemetry.
Etiology may likely be alcohol related cardiomyopathy.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation.
2.  Congestive heart failure.
3.  Cardiomyopathy, unclear etiology.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Good.  Patient is saturating well on
room air and is to be discharged home with follow up with the
primary care physician which will be set in the [**Hospital 191**] Clinic.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Prednisone 60 mg p.o. q. day for three days post
discharge, no taper.
2.  Erythromycin 500 mg p.o. q. day times four days.
3.  Albuterol and Atrovent MDIs.
4.  Lisinopril 2.5 mg p.o. q. day.
