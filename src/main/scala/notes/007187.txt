Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
intubation

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 55594**] is a 63 year old diabetic woman with chronic and
progressive hypoxemia over the course of several years felt to
be secondary to CEP and IPF who was transferred from [**Hospital 100**]
Rehab after she was found to confused and hypoxic this morning.
She was found to have SpO2 of 55%, down from baseline SpO2 in
the 70's-80's.  Per their transfer note, she has had a dry,
non-productive cough and no recent fevers or chills.  Attempt to
contact HCP [**Name (NI) 915**] regarding her code status was unsuccessful,
and she was transported to [**Hospital1 18**].
.
Upon arrival to [**Hospital1 18**] ED, HR 105, BP 160/101, RR 20, SpO2 74% on
6L NC.  SpO2 improved to 90% on 40% ventimask.  She was reported
to be drowsy and confused but arousable and oriented x 3.  ABG
on arrival was 7.38/59/34. She confirmed her code status to be
full code, and she was subsequently sedated with etomidate/succ
and intubated.  A propofol gtt was started and BP dropped to
78/44 after bolus for agitation.  BP's improved with 1.5 L IVF
bolus.  She received Decadron 10 mg IV, Metronidazole 500 mg IV,
and Levofloxacin 750 mg IV.  CXR and CTA were performed.


Past Medical History:
1) Ephysema: [**4-10**] PFT's with FEV1 of 2.69 liters (106%
predicted) and an FVC of 3.5 liters (101% predicted).  Her
FEV1/FVC ratio is 76.80 (105% predicted).  These data are within
the normal range but with a progressive decline since her most
recent study from [**9-7**].
2) IPF
3) Chronic eosinophilic pneumonia, diagnosed based on hypoxia,
peripheral infiltrates, peripheral eosinophilia as pt declined
bronch)
4) Severe OSA, intermittently compliant with BiPAP.  CPAP best
at pressures of [**8-11**] cm and BiPAP at 13/9 with 2 liters of O2.
5) Diabetes mellitus, type II
6) Osteomyelitis/L foot ulcer/Charcot Foot s/p exostectomy
plantar tarsal bone, left foot and hardware removal left foot in
[**2125-1-2**], s/p MRSA wound infection treated with Daptomycin
7) Chronic renal insufficiency
8) Acute methemoglobunemia [**2-3**] hurricaine spray
9) HTN
10) Hyperlipidemia
11) Diastolic CHF ECHO [**2-/2125**]; LVEF>55%
12) h/o lung nodules (7 mm spiculated LUL nodules, 6mm RUL
nodule)
13) Psoriasis
14) Hypothyroidism
15) h/o positive PPD
16) h/o compression fractures
17) Breast cancer, dx in [**2100**], s/p partial R mastectomy
18) Peripheral neuropathy
19) Depression, previous h/o hospitalization
20) Urge incontinence


Social History:

2 hernia repairs as a child


Family History:
Noncontributory

Physical Exam:
VS: T 99, HR 97, BP 145/89, RR, SpO2 97% on FiO2 100%
Gen: elderly WF, intubated, awake, attempting to communicate
with hand motions
HEENT: intubated, dry mucous membranes, PERRL, sclerae anicteric
CV: RRR, nl S1 and S2, distant heart sounds, no appreciable
murmur
Resp: diminished breath sounds, prolonged expiratory phase, no
expiratory wheezes, no rales or rhonchi
Abdomen: obese, soft, non-tender, non-distended
Extrem: WWP, left Charcot foot/ankle with loss of plantar arch,
contracted toes; bilateral lower extremity erythema, 1+ lower
extremity edema to mid shins


Pertinent Results:
.
EKG: sinus rhythm, rate 75, normal intervals, normal axis; TWI
in I, aVL, V2-V6; Twave flattening in II; 1mm ST elevation in
aVR
.
IMAGING:
CXR [**2125-5-28**]: Mild cardiomegaly is stable. ET tube is 4 cm above
the
level of the carina. A nasogastric tube tip extends to the
stomach, however the sidehole remains above the GE junction. The
right lateral chest wall is excluded from the radiograph. Dense
retrocardiac opacity is noted likely due to atelectasis,
however, a focal infectious process cannot be completely
excluded. There is marked prominence of the pulmonary
interstitium, likely acute pulmonary edema superimposed on
emphysema. No sizable left pleural effusion is seen. There is no
pneumothorax.
IMPRESSION:
1. Satisfactory position of the endotracheal tube. NG tube needs
advancement by at least 8 cm.
2. Acute pulmonary edema, likely cardiogenic in etiology.
3. Left retrocardiac density as above. Likely atelectasis,
however
pneumonia cannot be excluded.
.
CTA CHEST [**2125-5-28**]: There are no filling defects in the main
segmental pulmonary arteries to suggest bilateral pulmonary
embolism. The evaluation of distal segmental branches,
especially to lower lobes is limited. Pulmonary artery remains
significantly enlarged. The heart size remains enlarged. Again
noted is a calcified and non-calcified plaque in the aorta. Some
of the noncalcified plaque is ulcerated. There is no pericardial
or pleural effusion. Coronary calcification involves LAD, RCA,
and circumflex. Diffuse bilateral septal thickening has
developed in the interval, when compared to the prior study.
There is severe extensive emphysema, involving the entire lungs,
more pronounced in the upper lobes, right greater than left.
The airways are patent to the segmental levels bilaterally.
Limited
evaluation of upper abdominal organs is unremarkable. The
patient is post right mastectomy. Several mediastinal lymph
nodes are present, measuring up to 14 mm in the prevascular and
lower paratracheal
station. There is a left hilar node, measuring 13 mm in short
axis diameter. Enlarged right hilar nodes are also present.
BONE WINDOWS: Demonstrate no concerning lytic or sclerotic
lesions. The compression fracture of T8 vertebral body is
unchanged in extent. Extensive degenerative changes of the right
glenohumeral joints are again noted.
IMPRESSION:
1. Interval development of diffuse bilateral septal thickening,
most likely secondary to cardiogenic edema, given acute
presentation. However, in a patient with apparent history of
breast carcinoma (not provided but surmised from images), septal
thickening may also be due to lymphangitic tumor spread.
2. Mediastinal lymphadenopathy.
