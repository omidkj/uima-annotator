Admission Date:  [**2200-3-3**]       Discharge Date:  [**2200-3-8**]

Date of Birth:   [**2131-12-24**]       Sex:  F

Service:  CARDIOLOGY

HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 68-year-old
female with a past medical history significant for type 2
diabetes, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia.  One day prior to
admission, the patient developed the gradual onset of
substernal chest pressure.  She experienced severe [**8-29**] pain
with no radiation.  She did have associated symptoms of
diaphoresis and shortness of breath.  She self-medicated with
one aspirin.  Subsequently, the patient was unable to sleep
due to persistent symptoms and progressive shortness of
breath.  She then called her neighbor who called 9-1-1.

In the ambulance, the patient was given two sublingual
nitroglycerin and put on oxygen.  She arrived at [**Hospital1 **]
Emergency Department where her EKG revealed ST elevations in
leads V1 through lead V4 and left axis deviation.  She was
treated with Fentanyl, nitroglycerin, Integrelin, and heparin
drips.  She was subsequently transferred to [**Hospital6 1760**] for further management.

On arrival to [**Hospital3 **] Hospital, her EKG showed left axis
deviation, ST elevations in leads V1 through V4 and ST
depressions in the inferior leads.  The patient was
subsequently taken to the Catheterization Laboratory where
she was found to have a 100% proximal LAD occlusion which was
stented without complication.  She also had a mid RCA lesion
of 50% and a 40% distal RCA lesion.  Her left main coronary
artery was within normal limits.  In the Catheterization
Laboratory it was also noted that she had elevated cardiac
pressures including a capillary wedge pressure of 27.  At the
conclusion of the catheterization procedure, the patient was
stable and transferred to the CCU for observation and
management.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Vital signs:  The patient
was afebrile, pulse 96, blood pressure 135/80, respiratory
rate 16, 97% on 2 liters oxygen.  The patient appeared very
well, in no acute distress.  She had no carotid bruits.  Her
carotid upstroke was brisk.  She had no appreciable JVD.
Cardiac:  Holosystolic murmur at the apex and also a systolic
ejection murmur at the base.  Her S1 and S2 heart sounds were
within normal limits.  She had no gallops.  Lungs:  Clear
bilaterally anteriorly.  Abdomen:  Soft, nontender.  Groin:
Her right groin had no hematoma and no bruits.  Extremities:
Notable for trace lower extremity edema and 2+ pulses
bilaterally.  Neurologic:  Nonfocal with her motor and
sensory function grossly intact.

LABORATORY DATA:  An echocardiogram was performed which
showed a 35-40% ejection fraction.  It also showed apical
akinesis.  A subsequent chest x-ray revealed mild pulmonary
edema and cardiomegaly.  Her mediastinum was within normal
limits.

Her Chem-7 was within normal limits including her renal
function, BUN 28, and creatinine 0.8.  Her hematocrit was
29.5 which remained stable.  Her peak CK level was 3,200,
troponin I peak 1.2.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Throughout her hospital course, her
cardiovascular status remained stable.  The patient required
no hemodynamic support.  Her heart rate and blood pressure
were treated with Lopressor and Captopril during her
admission.  These medications were titrated for a goal heart
rate in the 60s and a blood pressure goal of 120 systolic.
She was also treated with aspirin and statins.

During her hospital course, she did develop intermittent
shortness of breath consistent with congestive heart failure.
She was treated with loop diuretics which improved her
respiratory status over the course of her admission up until
discharge.  At no time did the patient develop an arrhythmia
during her hospital course and she had a signal-average EKG
performed during her admission which will be interpreted at a
later date.

Her hematocrit remained stable throughout her admission.  Due
to her history of diabetes, she was initially started on an
insulin sliding scale and subsequently changed back to her
oral home medications.  Due to her improved respiratory
status with diuresis and resolution of her pulmonary crackles
on examination, the patient was deemed stable for discharge
on the date of [**2200-3-8**].

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Plavix 75 mg q.d.
2.  Atorvostatin 20 mg q.d.
3.  Aspirin 325 mg q.d.
4.  Toprol XL 50 mg q.d.
5.  Zestril 5 mg q.d.
6.  Warfarin 2 mg q.d.
7.  Glyburide 5 mg b.i.d.
8.  Avandia 4 mg b.i.d.
9.  Metformin 500 mg five pills per day, two with breakfast,
two with lunch, and one with dinner.
10. Lasix 20 mg q.d.

FOLLOW-UP:  The patient has the following appointments
scheduled:  1)  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 7986**], PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] Tuesday, [**2200-3-11**] at
2:30 p.m.  At that time, she will need her INR and PT checked
with Coumadin dosing and a referral to see a cardiologist at
a later date.  2)  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 911**] at [**Hospital1 18**] scheduled for [**2200-3-21**] at 10:00 a.m.  At this time, she will need her blood
pressure and heart rate medications titrated.  She will also
need her signal-average EKG interpreted.
