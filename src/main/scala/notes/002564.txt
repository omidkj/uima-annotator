History of Present Illness:
History of Present Illness
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 58 yo woman with a history of HCV cirrhosis s/p
TIPS [**3-5**] who presents with increased abdominal distension.
.
She previously had refractory ascites in early [**2145**], and
underwent placement of TIPS for this reason. She was then doing
well and was without significant ascites on aldactone. Lasix was
added [**11-4**] for some edema. Subsequently her ascites continued to
worsen. She was getting therapeutic paracentesis with removal of
[**7-4**] L each time every two weeks. US [**11-18**] showed increased
velocity in the TIPS.
.
She was recently admitted to [**Hospital3 **] [**Date range (1) 40579**] with
increasing SOB, received 60 mg lasix underwent removal of 10 L
of ascitic fluid, with resolution of SOB. Creatinine at that
time on admission was 1.8. She had an ultrasound with Doppler
[**12-12**] showing increased flow in the TIPS.
.
She was doing well until [**12-18**] when she presented for routine
labs and was found to have renal failure beyond her baseline
(creatinine 2.0 elevated from recent b/l 1.5) and hyperkalemia
to 5.4 with peaked T waves. She received kayexalate, insulin,
bicarb, D50 and was admitted. Diuretics were held. Because of
concern for TIPS occlusion, she was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for
possible revision.
.
On acceptance to the medicine team, she complains of epigastric
pain, worse with lying and accompanied by a sour taste. She
denies fevers, chills, change in bowel movements or blood in BM
(baseline 4 BM/day on lactulose). Also no chest pain or
shortness of breath. No urinary symptoms.
.
Upon admission to [**Hospital1 18**], plan was to proceed with TIPS revision.
 The day of admission to the MICU, she underwent TIPS revision
and had a 6L paracentesis.  Intraoperatively you way hypotensive
to SBP 70s, treated with 1L 5% albumin and neo gtt without
complication.  [**Name (NI) **], pt again became hypotensive to
the 70s, asymmptomatic and resolve with 50g 25% albumin and
500cc NS.   In total in [**Name (NI) 13042**], pt received 1400cc NS, 800cc
Bicarb/D5W and 200cc of 25% albumin.  EBL 147ml.
.
Upon transfer to MICU, patient confirms story as above.  States
she's had some mild abdominal pain.

LIVER OR GALLBLADDER US [**12-21**] (to evaluate TIPs)
IMPRESSION:
1. Patent TIPS with velocities of 100 to 180 cm/s.
2. There is a lack of wall-to-wall flow in the mid to distal
TIPS, suggestive
of neo-intimal hyperplasia.

exam.
4. Splenomegaly.


Brief Hospital Course:
A 57 yo woman with HCV cirrhosis s/p TIPS is transferred from
OSH with refractory ascites for consideration of TIPS revision.

.
# Ascites: The patient had large ascites on exam but was not
uncomfortable. Last therapeutic tap had been [**12-13**]. Ultrasound
showed lack of wall-to-wall flow in the mid to distal TIPS,
suggestive of neo-intimal hyperplasia.  Given the history of
apparent improvement in ascites after placement and subsequently
after revision of TIPS, she underwent TIPS revision with 10 mm
balloon and improved flow. Follow-up US two days later showed
patent tips.  Paracentesis of 6 L was done at the time of
revision, and an additional 11.25 liters were taken off two days
later, with albumin replacement each time.  Diuretics were held
for elevated creatinine.  PPI was continued for reflux symptoms
likely secondary to ascites.
.
# Hypotension:  Intraoperatively while under general anesthesia,
patient was hypotensive with SBP 70s.  This continued in the
[**Month/Year (2) 13042**] post-operatively.  Initial hypotension likely related to
anesthesia and fluid shift from large volume paracentesis.  She
was transferred briefly to the MICU, where blood pressure
returned to baseline SBP 90s with IVF and albumin.
.
# Acute renal failure: Creatinine at OSH was increased from
baseline 1.5 to 2.0. On admission, creatinine was 1.7. Diuretics
were held. Urinary sodium was <10, consistent with prerenal vs
HRS.  She was given albumin at the time of paracentesis, and
creatinine trended down to 1.5 prior to discharge.  She was
discharged off all diuretics with plans for lab tests in 3 days
to monitor kidney function given that she had large volume
paracentesis on the day of discharge.
.
# UTI: She had had a recent E Coli treated with Bactrim at an
outside hospital.  UA and cultures here were negative.
.
# Hyponatremia: Sodium was near baseline. She was asymptomatic.

.
# DM: Lantus was continued at home dose; she was given regular
insulin as needed.
.
# Pancytopenia: Hematocrit and platelets were at baseline.
.
# Depression/Anxiety. Mirtazapine and trazadone were continued.
.
# Seizure disorder:  Carbamazepine was continued.
.
