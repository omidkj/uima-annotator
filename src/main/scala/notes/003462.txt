Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5755**]
Chief Complaint:
nausea, vomiting

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none


History of Present Illness:
55 yo woman s/p head injury 1.5 weeks ago who presented with
n/v/lethargy. She has been having ongoing nausea and vomiting
and decreased PO intake for a few months [**1-3**] decreased taste in
her mouth. She reports she has not been eating because the man
that lives with her is eating all of her foods.  She has been
taking her diuretics as prescribed. In the ED, she got 3L IVF
and Levo/Amp/Flagyl.  A CT of the head was unremarkable and CT
of the abdomen showed a distended gallbladder with sludge but no
evidence of cholecystitis.  She was admitted to the ICU for
hypotension.

Pertinent Results:
ECHO [**2126-6-25**]:
The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
are normal. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. Left ventricular systolic
function is
hyperdynamic (EF 70-80%). Tissue velocity imaging demonstrates
an E/e' <8
suggesting a normal left ventricular filling pressure (<12mmHg).
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. There is no
ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and
free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion. There is
no aortic valve stenosis. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. There
is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.

SYMPTOMS: ATYPICAL PEAK INTENSITY: 1
ST DEPRESSION: NONE
INTERPRETATION: 55yo female with history of depression and
orthopedic surgeries is referred to the lab for evaluation of
chest pain
and recent NSTEMI. The patient was administered 0.142mg/kg/min
of
Persantine IV over 4 minutes. The patient complained of breif
chest
pressure for 30 seconds after the infusion was finished. There
were no
ST segment changes during infusion or recovery. The rhythm was
sinus
with one APC. The hemodynamic response to Persantine was
adequate. Three
minutes after MIBI injection, the patient was administered 125mg

aminophylline IV.
IMPRESSION: Transient atypical chest pain with no ischemic EKG
changes.
Nuclear report sent separately.
.
IMPRESSION:
No evidence of myocardial perfusion defect at peak pharmacologic
stress.  Normal left ventricular cavity size and systolic
function.
.
EKG [**6-20**] NSR @ 80 bpm, normal axis, QTC mildly prolonged at 445
(415 in '[**10**]), [**Street Address(2) 4793**] dep V4-5 o/w no ischemic changes
.
Imaging:
[**6-20**] Abd U/S: No evidence of hydronephrosis. Small amount of
gallbladder sludge without evidence for cholecystitis.
.
[**6-20**] Head CT: No evidence of intracranial hemorrhage. Thickening
of the bony wall of the right maxillary sinus now with interval
development of mucosal thickening in the right greater than left
maxillary sinuses consistent with history of chronic sinusitis.
.
[**6-20**] CXR: No free intraperitoneal air. The lung bases are clear.
The heart size is normal. The visualized osseous structures are
unremarkable. At the most inferior aspect of the image, there
are two circular metallic densities within the intervertebral
disc space, likely representing spacers.
.
[**6-20**] CT Abd/pelvis w/o contrast: No evidence of pancreatitis or
appendicitis. Mildly distended gallbladder with no surrounding
fluid collections. Some air-fluid levels within a stool filled
colon with mild distention. These findings are suggestive of
gastroenteritis
.
[**6-21**] CXR PA/lat: Nasogastric tube terminates in the stomach.
Diffuse interstitial edema, likely due to fluid overload

Brief Hospital Course:
# Hypotension:
Likely due to severe dehydration in the setting of poor po's,
gastroenteritis, and concurrent diuretics.  Cortisol stim test
appropriate (34->53).  Cultures were all negative (1 set of
cultures with coag neg staph, thought to be contaminant; all
other blood cultures negative) and no evidence of infection
identified.  LFTs bumped but attributed to shock liver;
hepatitis panel was negative (Hep Bs Ab and Ag, Hep C ab, and
Hep A ab negative).  ECHO shows hyperdynamic heart without
significant valvular disease.  P-MIBI showed no inducible
ischemia.  Patient has about [**1-4**] bowel movements per day.  She
was encouraged to drink plenty of fluid and to avoid further use
of diuretics.  On the day of discharge, bp standing 93/56 (she
was not orthostatic).  She was mentating normally and making
good urine.  She will follow-up with her primary care doctor [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 61447**]y for a repeat blood pressure check.
.
# Demand ischemia:
Patient had troponin peak of 0.22 in the setting of her
hypotension.  Her CK and MB remained flat.  Cardiology was
consulted when patient developed acute pulmonary edema in the
setting of aggressive IVF resuscitation.  They suspected CHF due
to aggressive resuscitation + mild demand ischemia with the peak
in troponin due to her acute renal failure.  They recommended an
ECHO which showed a hyperdynamic heart.  Given persistent low
blood pressure, her stress was done in house and showed no
evidence of inducible ischemia.  Her beta blocker and aspirin
were thus discontinued.
.
# ARF:
Patient bumped her creatinine to 7.6 in the setting of
hypotension and dehydration.  She denied recent NSAID use.
Renal was consulted and noted muddy brown casts on micro exam,
consistent with acute tubular necrosis.  No rbc or wbc casts
were seen and urine eos were negative.  A renal ultrasound
showed no evidence of hydronephrosis.  Her creatinine improved
to 1.0 by the time of discharge.  SPEP and UPEP were negative.
.
# Transaminitis:
Likely due to shock liver.  Peak AST 211 (35 on day of
discharge) and peak ALT 190 (42 on day of discharge).  Hep panel
was negative.  Her statin, zetia, and topamax were held.  Her
topamax was restarted on the day of discharge.
.
# Fever:
