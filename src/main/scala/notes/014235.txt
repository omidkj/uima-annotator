Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 9449**] was admitted from an OSH to the vascular service and
placed in the CVICU with a left carotid pseudoaneurysm. She was
tachycardic on admission with a known  history of afib with poor
rate control. She was started on an amiodarone gtt. She was also
started on prophylactic antibiotics.  A cardiology consult was
obtained given the afib with rvr. They recommended diuresis and
rate control with IV metoprolol.  She underwent preop
evaluation, was consented and taken to the OR for L CA
pseudoaneurysm resection--ligation L ICA/CCA.  She tolerated the
procedure well and was transfered back to the CVICU post
operatively. She was still quite hypertensive and tachycardiac
overnight and was managed with IV gtts.  On POD 1 she was
transitioned to oral medications. She was neurologically intact
and doing well. Her rate control was decent although she
continued to have bursts of tachycardia throughout her stay.
Her home medications were confirmed with her daughter and her
home pharmacy and they were all resumed accordingly.  The
patients daughter reported she had a long history of afib with
difficulty controlling and had failed cardioversion x 3 as well
as multiple medication regimens. When hemodynamically stable and
rate controlled she was transfered to the vascular floor. She
continued to be monitored closely. She began working with PT,
her JP drain was removed and her coumadin restarted. She
continued to show improvement. PT worked with her daily and
ultimately cleared her for home with PT.  She was placed on
lovenox injections in conjunction with her coumadin until her
INR is therapeutic. She continued to have short [**Last Name (un) 24048**] of rapid
afib which spontaneously resolved. Discussion with her PCP
revealed this is baseline for the patient.  She had a wound
culture which ultimately grew no organisms, as well as two urine
cultures, one which grew nothing, the second which grew minimal
yeast. By POD 5 she was able to ambulate independently, was
tolerating a regular diet and voiding without difficulty. She
was cleared by PT for home with services. Her bp and rate were
felt to be at baseline, and her wound was clean and healing
nicely.  She was deemed stable for discharge home with close
follow up both in the vascular clinic and with her pcp.
