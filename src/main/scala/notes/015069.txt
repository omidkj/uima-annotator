Chief Complaint:
Delerium


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
IR Guided Abscess Aspiration

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 42484**] is an 80 y/o man with PMHx CVA with residual L
hemi-neglect and cognitive deficits and Crohn's disease s/p
recent laparotomy/end ileostomy ([**2167-3-12**]) for SBO as well as
ongoing steroid taper and Abx for intraabdominal abscess who was
brought to the ED due to confusion and decreased level of
alertness. At the time of most recent d/c ([**2167-4-10**]), pt was sent
home on IV Cipro/Flagyl for multiple intraabdominal abscesses
which were not amenable to IR guided drainage. He subsequently
presented to the ED on [**4-11**] with AMS and RUE swelling. RUE
ultrasound at that time showed brachial vein thrombus. His PICC
was pulled, antibiotics were changed to PO Cipro/Flagyl and the
pt was started on Lovenox and sent back to rehab. On the morning
of [**4-13**], his daughter visited him and noted he was altered - not
speaking, not interactive from a baseline of A/Ox3, interactive
with occasional confusion and inapproproate responses to
questions. For this, he was sent to the ED for evaluation.
.
In the ED, initial VS were:
T 97.9, pulse 68, BP 125/71, O2 99% RA.
Labs notable for WBC 17.4 (94% PMN, no bands), lacate 3.1 and
HCT 33.5 (baselione 20s). He received IV Vanc/Zosyn. He also
received 2L NS for his elevated lactate. Head CT showed 12-mm
left subdural collection with heterogeneous attenuation,
suggesting a subacute or chronic component with foci of
hyperdensity which may represent acute blood. Additionally a
large right parieto-temporal CSF density structure of
indeterminate etiology, thought to represent a large arachnoid
cyst, was observed. CT Abd/Pelvis showed stable to minimally
decreased size of air-containing left lower quadrant/pelvic
fluid collection. Neurosurgery was consulted and felt there was
no need for urgent neurosurgical intervention. Given initial
elevated lactate and WBC count, patient was admitted to the MICU
given concern for early sepsis. On arrival to the MICU, lactate
was rechecked: 1.9. Given his response to IVF and absence of a
pressor requirement, pt was called out to medicine [**2167-4-14**].
.
On arrival to the floor, initial VS were:
T 97.5 BP 105/68 HR 75 rr 18 O2 Sat 99% RA
Pt denies CP/SOB/N/V/HA. No complaints at this time. He is
A/Ox3, appropriate and interactive.
.
ROS: Denies fever, chills, night sweats, headache, vision
changes, rhinorrhea, congestion, sore throat, cough, shortness
of breath, chest pain, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting,
diarrhea, constipation, BRBPR, melena, hematochezia, dysuria,
hematuria.

Brief Hospital Course:
Primary Reason for Admission:  Mr. [**Known lastname 42484**] is an 80 y/o
gentleman with Crohn's Disease s/p laparotomy/end ileostomy
([**2167-3-12**]) for SBO c/b multiple intraabdominal abscess on steroid
taper and IV antibiotics, recent RUE thrombus at PICC site as
well as subacute SDH admitted to the MICU for elevated lactate
concerning for sepsis.
.
# Delerium/Encephalopathy: His altered mental status was ikely
multifactorial; contributing factors include delerium and
toxic/metabolic encephalopahy. His mental status waxed and waned
initially, but had normalized by the time of d/c. Given his
multiple recent hospitalizations and poor neurologic substrate,
delerium risk is very high. The precipitating factor for his
acute mental status change was most likey his intra-abdominal
infections given his AMS started in the setting of PICC
associated thrombus, which may have affected systemic delivery
of IV antibiotics. His AMS worsened when placed on PO
antibiotics, which is not unexpected given his extensive bowel
resection and evidence of undigested pills in his ostomy on CT
scan. He was initially started on Vanc/Zosyn in the MICU.
Antibiotics were narrowed to IV Cipro/Flagyl on arrival to the
floor and his mental status normalized, but once VSE and
presumptive strep bovis grew, we put him on vancomycin. He
occasionally refused to speak with staff and family, though this
was due to frustration with his multiple medical problems and
not due to an organic problem, and was resolving by discharge. .

.
# Abscesses/Leukocytosis: Pt was initially admitted to the MICU
with leukocytosis and elevated lactate concerning for early
sepsis. Broad spectum antimicrob
