Admission Date:  [**2142-5-24**]     Discharge Date:  [**2142-5-27**]

Date of Birth:   [**2065-10-5**]     Sex:  F

Service:  Coronary Care Unit

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 76-year-old
female with a history of hypercholesterolemia presenting with
shortness of breath on the day prior to admission.

She called the Emergency Medical Service who took her to the
[**Hospital3 417**] Hospital.  In the Emergency Department there,
she was found to be in congestive heart failure with severe
respiratory distress.  She was subsequently intubated, and
her initial arterial blood gas was 7.17/50/83.  She was given
80 mg of intravenous Lasix with a good 800 cc of urine output
initially.  Her electrocardiogram showed a new left
bundle-branch block, and her cardiac enzymes were negative
except for a mildly elevated troponin.  The patient was given
medication for agitation, and her blood pressure was noted to
drop to a systolic blood pressure in the 80s.  The patient
was given some intravenous fluids initially and then started
on a dopamine drip for blood pressure maintenance.

The patient was transferred here for emergent cardiac
catheterization after a bedside echocardiogram was performed
with a read of an ejection fraction of 10% to 20%.

Her cardiac catheterization here revealed minimal coronary
artery disease, with a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of
25, moderate mitral regurgitation, and an ejection fraction
of about 30% to 40% (on dopamine).  The patient was quickly
weaned off dopamine to a pressure support of [**5-30**] on the
ventilator.  She still continued to have good urine output
after the 80 mg of Lasix at the outside hospital.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Ventilator AC 600 X
16, FIO2 of 100%, positive end-expiratory pressure of 5.
Drips:  dopamine 5 mcg/kg per minute.  Vital signs revealed
her temperature was 96.5 degrees Fahrenheit, her heart rate
was 87, her blood pressure was 111/50, her respiratory rate
was 14, and her oxygen saturation was 96%.  Generally, she
was in no acute distress.  She was intubated and sedated.
Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat examination revealed the
mucous membranes were moist.  Cardiovascular examination
revealed a regular rate and rhythm.  A [**3-2**] holosystolic
murmur at the apex.  Pulmonary examination revealed some
bibasilar crackles.  The abdomen was soft, nontender, and
nondistended.  There were normal active bowel sounds.  The
extremities were without edema.  Dorsalis pedis and posterior
tibialis pulses were 2+.  A right groin venous sheath was in
place.

PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:  White blood
cell count was 11, her hematocrit was 38.4, and her platelets
were 177.  Sodium was 145, potassium was 3.5, chloride was
112, bicarbonate was 21, blood urea nitrogen was 20,
creatinine was 1.4, and her blood glucose was 119.  Calcium
was 8.1, her phosphate was 4.4, and her magnesium was 1.8.
Creatine kinase was 124.  Troponin T was less than 0.05.
Arterial blood gas was 7.34/43/110.  BAT high of 82.

PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  Electrocardiogram revealed a
left bundle-branch block, a normal sinus rhythm, and a heart
rate of 106.  A new left bundle-branch block from [**2139**].

A chest x-ray was consistent with congestive heart failure.

Catheterization revealed a right atrial pressure of 10,
pulmonary artery pressure of 42/28, and pulmonary capillary
wedge pressure of 25.  Oxygen saturation of 81%, FVC
saturation of 82%.  No significant coronary artery disease.
A small right coronary artery in a left-dominant system.
Mild-to-moderate depressed left ventricular function.
Cardiac output of 7.8.  Cardiac index of 4.3.  Systemic
vascular resistance of 872.

An echocardiogram revealed an ejection fraction of 20%,
severe left ventricular dilatation, and hypokinesis.  Mild
aortic root dilatation.  Moderate-to-severe mitral
regurgitation (3+).

SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE BY ISSUE/SYSTEM:

1.  CARDIOVASCULAR ISSUES (PUMP):   The patient with an
ejection fraction of 25% to 30% by echocardiogram.  The
patient was continued on aspirin, Toprol 25 mg, Lipitor, and
Valsartan.  The patient was ruled out for a myocardial
infarction with cycled enzymes and telemetry.

In terms of her new left bundle-branch block, this may be a
degenerative change.  The patient was ruled out for a
myocardial infarction without events on telemetry.

2.  PULMONARY ISSUES:  The patient with respiratory arrest,
suspicious for flash pulmonary edema in the setting of
possible underlying diastolic dysfunction with severe
hypertension with systolic blood pressures in the 180s to
190s in the ambulance.  Although, after diuresis, the patient
weaned easily off of the ventilator and was saturating well
on room air.  She responded well to intravenous Lasix and
will be continued on 40 mg of by mouth Lasix as an
outpatient.

The patient was instructed to weigh herself daily and notify
her doctor if she gained more than three pounds at a time.

3.  ACUTE RENAL FAILURE ISSUES:  Superimposed on chronic
renal insufficiency.  The patient with a likely baseline
creatinine of 1.3 and likely acute worsening of her
creatinine secondary to hypotensive episodes.  The patient's
creatinine improved to a baseline level of 1.3.  She likely
has chronic renal insufficiency secondary to atherosclerotic
disease.

4.  PERNICIOUS ANEMIA ISSUES:  The patient was continued on
B12 while she was in the hospital.  Her hematocrit remained
normal.

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  Stable.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  The patient was discharged to home with
home [**Hospital6 407**] services.

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS/FOLLOWUP:
1.  The patient was instructed to follow up with her Dr.
[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] of Cardiology in one to two weeks.  She was to
call telephone number [**Telephone/Fax (1) 3183**] to schedule an
appointment.
2.  The patient was also instructed to follow up with Dr.
[**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 284**] regarding the possible need for a
pacemaker in the future.  She was to call telephone number
[**Telephone/Fax (1) 285**] for an appointment.
3.  The patient was also instructed to follow up with her
primary care provider (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 55973**] in one to two weeks.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
1.  Aspirin 81 mg by mouth once per day.
2.  Lipitor 20 mg by mouth once per day.
3.  Lasix 40 mg by mouth once per day.
4.  Toprol 25 mg by mouth once per day.
5.  Spironolactone 25 mg by mouth once per day.
6.  Valsartan 80 mg by mouth once per day.
7.  Ciprofloxacin 500 mg by mouth once per day (times three
days for a urinary tract infection).
