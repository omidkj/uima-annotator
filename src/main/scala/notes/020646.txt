Blood and urine cultures were negative as was wound culture from
R 2nd toe.
.
CT Head: negative
.
Echo:
The left atrium is elongated. No atrial septal defect is seen by
2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity
size, and global systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%). Due to
suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality
cannot be fully excluded. There is no ventricular septal defect.
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
The diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels
are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is
no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There
is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.
.
Renal U/S:
IMPRESSION:
1. Normal right kidney.
2. Linear hyperechogenic focus in left kidney likely represents
crystals in
caliceal diverticulum.
3. Incidental note of fatty liver infiltration. Other forms of
liver disease
and more advanced liver disease including significant hepatic
fibrosis/cirrhosis cannot be excluded on this study.
.
RUQ U/A:
IMPRESSION:
1. Echogenic liver consistent with fatty infiltration. Other
forms of liver
disease and more advanced liver disease including significant
hepatic
fibrosis/cirrhosis cannot be excluded on this study.
2. No gallbladder present.
3. Doppler assessment of the main portal vein shows patency and
hepatopetal
flow.

Brief Hospital Course:
71 year old female with DM and HTN admitted with hypotension,
hypoxia, hypoglycemia and delirium in setting of recent fall.
.
#. Hypotension: Unclear if hypovolemia, sepsis or medication
effect. Treated with vancomycin, ceftriazone and azithromycin
initially for suspected pneumonia. After fluid boluses
hypotension resolved and she remained hemodynamically stable.
TTE without abnormality and ruled out for MI. Patient was
restarted back on her anti-hypertensives on the floor without
recurrence.
.
#. Hypoxemia: Likely secondary to pneumonia. Patient with CXR
with possible developing pneumonia and brown sputum. Treated
with ceftriaxone and azithromycin. Legionella antigen negative
so azithromycin discontinued. After transfer to the floor, the
patient was diuresed with IV Lasix after CXR showed worsening
pulmonary edema. She completed a 7-day course of ceftriaxone.
.
#. Hypoglycemia: Thought to be secondary to antiglycemics in
setting of acute renal insufficiency. The patient required D50
amp and infusion with D10W fluid. With improvement in kidney
function and holding antiglycemics the patients blood sugar
improved.
.
# Diabetes: The patient was on sliding scale humalog insulin on
the floor. On discharge, home metformin and glyburide were
restarted.
.
#. Acute kidney injury: Likely secondary to pre-renal etiology.
Initially nephrotoxic and antihypertensives held. Creatinine
improved with IVF from 3.5 to 1.0. Renal ultrasound showed no
hydronephrosis but did show a caliceal diverticulum with some
crystals.
.
#. Delirium: Mental status improved with correction of
hypovolemia and low b
