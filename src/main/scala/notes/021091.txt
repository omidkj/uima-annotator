Brief Hospital Course:
[**Age over 90 **] year old female with hypertension, hyperlipidemia,
hypothyroidism; presenting with extensive bilateral PE and high
O2 requirement.

#Pulmonary embolism. CTA showed massive bilateral filling
defects and R heart strain. Trigger unknown, but given cachexia
and age would be concerned for malignancy.  Ambulatory at
facility at baseline.  Unlikely to be primary hypercoaguable
state at her age.  No identified meds that would put her at
risk. She was hemodynamically stable with high O2 requirements.
She was started on IV heparin drip.  LENI's showed nonocclusive
thrombus involving the left superficial femoral
vein. TTE showed LEF 55% and most significant for markedly
dilated and hypokinetic RV, mod-severe TR, and mod pulm HTN. An
IVC filter was placed to prevent further clot burden.  IV
heparin was transitioned to lovenox for faciliation of
outpatient therapy.

#UTI - Patient was note dto have a positive urine culture for
pansensitive Ecoli.  She denied urinary symptoms, but due to her
incontinence and inability to assess dementia from baseline was
treated with at 3 day course of clinidamycin.

#Dysphagia - Patient was noted to have coughing with po intake
of nectar thick liquids.  It is unclear if her dysphagia is a
consequence of deconditioning from her acute illness and/or a
chronic change due to her dementia.  Speech and swallow was
consulted and recommended a video study.  Prior to the study,
patient and daughter discussed what they would want if patient
was aspirating on food and/or liquids, and pt wanted to be
allowed to eat anyway.  She was discharged to rehab with
instruction to include swallow therapy during her stay with
supervision during meals.

#Weakness - Pt was noted to be deconditioned due to her PE
during her hospitalization.

#Tachycardia/palpitations. In setting of acute PE.  Her heart
rate and her symptoms inproved with gentle hydration and
initiation of anticoagulation.

#Leukocytosis.  Initial WBCs 14K which improved to 8 without
intervention.  Likely stress response to PE and hypoxia.

#Dementia/bipolar. She was continued on home risperdal and
mirtazepine.

#Hiatal hernia.  NGT placed in ED for decompression out of
concern that this was leading to symptoms.  This was
discontinued on arrival to the MICU.

#Code:  Pt and daughter both confirm DNR/DNI status
