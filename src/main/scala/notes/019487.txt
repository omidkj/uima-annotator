Hip pain and drainage from prior surgical site

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Abscess drainage, washout, hardware removal, and antibiotic
spacer placement in the OR in the left hip.


History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 76yoF with multiple medical problems including CAD
s/p CABG, DM2, AS s/p bovine AVR, HTN, HLD and a left hip
hemiarthroplasty s/p infection/abx/washout/suppressive abx over
the last year, who was admitted [**7-29**] with a several week history
of left hip pain, which evolved to include edema, pain, and
finally mucopurulent drainage from her previous surgical
incision site. She underwent abscess drainage, washout, hardware
removal, and antibiotic spacer placement in the OR late on [**7-30**],
complicated by an intraoperative blood loss estimated at 1000cc.
She received 2 units PRBC. Tissue culture is having sparse coagu
negaitve sptaph. Last year tissue culture grew a coag negative
staph lugdunensis. Wound vac and drain were placed in the site.
ID is seeing her and has her on vancomycin 750mg Q12.
.
Post-operatively, she developed a dense delirium last night,
accusing staff of trying to kill her, pulling at IV lines and
her wound vac. Took a few swings at staff. Received IV haldol
0.5mg x 2 with good effect. QTC at 410. She has suffered post-op
delirium in previous surgeries, tends to wane in 2 days.
.
She has numerous metabolic derangements: hyperglycemic with AM
glucose 576 (though FSG shortly thereafter was 300 without any
interval insulin administered). Hyperkalemic with K=5.7 (no EKG
change). Hypomagnesemic. Tachycardic and dry-appearing with HCT
25ish. Complaining of some left hip pain.

Pelvis and dedicated left Hip X-Ray: [**2205-7-29**]
FINDINGS: AP view of the pelvis and three dedicated views of the
left hip obtained. Long stem left hip bipolar hemiarthroplasty,
cerclage wire, and greater trochanter hook device are in similar
position to prior. Lucencies surrounding the cement-bone
interfaces of the intertrochanteric region and proximal femur
are similar to prior, accounting for positioning. No evidence of
new osseous fracture. Diffuse demineralization is again seen.
Vascular calcifications and radiopaque pills in the right lower
quadrant are similar to prior. Numerous metallic clips over the
medial thigh soft tissues.
IMPRESSION: Stable position of left femoral hardware with
cement-bone.Preliminary Reportinterface lucencies similar to
prior.

CXR: [**2205-7-29**]
FINDINGS: The patient is status post aortic valve replacement
and probably coronary artery bypass graft surgery as well as
placement of fix
