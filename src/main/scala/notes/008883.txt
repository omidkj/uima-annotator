who gives most of the history. This morning the patient was
difficult to arouse. She woke up briefly to eat breakfast, but
went back to sleep without taking any of her medications today.
The husband tried to call the house at 11:30 AM, and the pt did
not answer the phone. He called the police for a well being
check, and due to patient confusion, ambulance was called to
bring the pt to the ED. The husband denies any witnessed seizure
activity. He states that the pt had been arousable at home but
confused. She has not had any recent illness. The pt denies CP,
SOB, d/c, nausea, headache. The husband has noted jerking of the
pts upper extremities over the past day.

Of note, pt had a similar presentation in [**3-1**] during which she
was admitted for confusion felt to be due to opiate
intoxication. She was treated with frequent narcan and haldol
during that admission, with recommendation for only bolused
morphine rather than basal dose on her PCA.
.
On arrival to the ED, the pt was diaphoretic and responsive only
to painful stimuli. Her pupils were noted to be pinpoint with T

Narcan 0.4 mg IVx1 and 3 L NS with improvement in

unresponsive with RR of 6. She was given Narcan 1 mg IV with
increase in responsiveness and increase in RR.
