CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Abdominal aortic aneurysm.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Patient was referred to Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 1476**] by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 109430**] at [**Location 1268**] VA for an abdominal
aortic aneurysm of 5.5 x 4.5 cm.  Patient is well known to
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1476**], who did previous arterial reconstruction on the
lower extremities bilaterally.  Patient admits to half a
block claudication on both calves, but some of this he
relates to his back and spine disease.  He feels at this time
given consideration, we are not sure as the growth rate of
the aneurysm, and he should undergo elective repair.  The
patient now is admitted for elective abdominal aortic repair.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
2. History of arrhythmias, which she takes quinidine tablets
two q day as well as Lanoxin.
3. He uses Serevent and Azmacort for his chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease.
4. Hypertension, which he is on Lasix for.

ALLERGIES:  He denies any allergies.

MEDICATIONS:
1. Aspirin 325 mg daily.
2. Lanoxin 0.1 mg daily.
3. Quinidine 324 mg tablets two [**Hospital1 **].
4. Lipitor 40 mg qid.
5. Lasix 20 mg q day.
6. Lisinopril 5 mg q day.
7. Albuterol, Azmacort, Serevent, and Atrovent inhalers.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:
1. Bilateral fem-tibial bypass in [**2185**] and in [**2184**].
2. Status post bronchoscopy.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  This is an elderly male in no acute
distress.  The patient has difficulty with word finding.
Does have a resting tremor, is hard of hearing.  Chest:
Diminished breath sounds throughout without adventitious
sounds.  Carotids are without bruits.  Cardiac examination:
Regular rhythm, no murmur.  Abdominal examination is benign
except for a pulsatile mass at the mid abdomen with no
abdominal bruits.  Extremities show bilateral pitting edema
with diminished hair on the lower extremities, and
extremities slightly cooler.  Pulse examination demonstrates
4+ femorals bilaterally.  On the left side, he has no pulses
below the femoral level.  On the right side, he has a patent
graft to the posterior tibial artery with a [**4-7**]+ posterior
tibial pulse.

PREOPERATIVE LABORATORY WORK:  Electrolytes:  BUN 20,
creatinine 1.4, potassium 4.1.  LFTs:  ALT, AST, 18 and 16
respectively, alkaline phosphatase 89, total bilirubin 0.4,
albumin 3.8, globulin 2.4.  Complete blood count:  White
count 8.2, hematocrit 34.5, platelets 176 k.  PT and PTT were
normal.

ELECTROCARDIOGRAM:  Showed a sinus rhythm, normal axis with
interventricular conduction defect, nondiagnostic Q waves in
II, III, aVL, aVF, V5 and 6.

CHEST X-RAY:  Consistent with chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease.

The patient underwent a cardiac catheterization on [**2195-8-14**]
which demonstrated single vessel disease involving the right
coronary artery with bridging collaterals.  The right
coronary artery is dominant system.  Left main trunk was
without disease.  The left anterior descending artery had
mild luminal irregularities about 20%.  Left circumflex was
without critical disease and supplied collaterals to the
right coronary artery.  The right coronary artery was totally
occluded proximally.

Patient was admitted to the preoperative holding area, and
underwent on [**2195-8-26**] abdominal aortic aneurysm repair with a
16 x 8 graft and a right renal artery bypass.  Patient was
transferred to the PACU in stable condition.  Patient had an
episode of hypertension requiring fluid bolus and 1 mg of
Neo-Synephrine.  He did receive 1 unit of packed red blood
cells intraoperatively.  His postoperative hematocrit was 37.
He otherwise was doing well.

Patient was extubated.  Gasses were 7.33, 45, 130, 25, and
-2.  His systolic blood pressure remained 90-110 with
adequate urinary output.  Patient was transferred to the VICU
for continued monitoring and care postoperative day one.
There were no further overnight events.  He was afebrile.
His systolic blood pressure was 104, diastolic 47.  CVP 13,
PA 36/18.  Index was 3.44.  Examination was unremarkable.
Wounds were clean, dry, and intact.  Abdomen was soft,
nondistended, palpable femorals, and dopplerable PTs
bilaterally with absent DP on the left and dopplerable DP on
the right.  Patient remained with epidural in place, and was
followed by the Acute Pain Service.

On postoperative day three, he was off his perioperative
Kefzol.  His systolic blood pressure improved to
134/diastolic 53, CVP 15, PA 41/18.  BUN and creatinine
remains stable.  Hematocrit was 30.5.  His examination
remained essentially unchanged.  He had no bowel sounds and
did not pass flatus.  IV fluids rate was decreased.  He
remained on bed rest and in the VICU.

Postoperative day three, onset of burping, but no flatus was
passed.  Hematocrit drifted to 26.5.  BUN was 26, creatinine
1.0, and IV fluids were D5 and half at 125 cc/hour.
Electrocardiogram was obtained, was a normal sinus rhythm at
70 with no acute changes.  He remained NPO.  He was
transfused 2 units of packed red blood cells with a
hematocrit of 26.5 with Lasix between.  He did show some
thrombocytopenia.  His Heparin was discontinued, and HIT was
sent.

Postoperative day four his post-transfusion hematocrit was
28.3.  He still had no bowel movements.  Continued on the
epidural.  He remained in the VICU.  He did require on
postoperative day five, additional Lasix dosing for elevated
central venous pressure secondary to volume overload.  With
adequate diuresis, his hematocrit remained stable at 29.
Abdomen remained mildly distended, but soft.  Wounds were
clean, dry, and intact, and bowel sounds were heard.
Electrolytes repleted as necessary.  PA catheter was changed
to triple lumen catheter.  Ambulation to chair was begun.  He
was continued NPO.  Epidural catheter was discontinued, and
he was converted to IV IM medications.

Postoperative day six flatus with bowel movement, significant
diuresis.  His HIT antibody was negative.  Heparin was
restarted for DVT prophylaxis.  Hematocrit was 31 and stable.
BUN 27, creatinine 1.0.  Examination was unremarkable.
Ambulation was continued.  He continued to be monitored in
the VICU.

Physical Therapy was requested to see the patient and they
felt that he was limited by a decrease endurance, and the
need for supplemental O2, they would continue to see the
patient and recommend that he be discharged to rehabilitation
when medically stable.

Patient with a low grade temperature on postoperative day
seven and a white count of 20.0.  Urine was obtained which
was negative.  Wounds were clean, dry, and intact.  A chest
x-ray was obtained which showed a right and left lower lobe
pneumonia.  Sputum showed 3+ oropharyngeal with greater than
25 polys and less than 10 epithelials.  He was begun on
levofloxacin.

On postoperative day seven, the patient was requested a
DNR/DNI because of some depression related to his slow
postoperative progress.  This was signed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1476**].

Postoperative day eight, he had positive blood cultures for
gram-positive cocci [**5-8**] and positive sputum for Staph-coag
positive, gram-negative rods.  Vancomycin was added to his
antibiotic regimen.  Lungs were noted to be clear with poor
air movement.  Abdomen was soft with bowel sounds.  Pedal
pulse examination remained unchanged, although there remained
some mild edema.  The Foley was discontinued.  He was
continued to be seen by Physical Therapy.

On postoperative day #9, the patient was transferred to the
regular nursing floor.  He remained with a low grade
temperature of 99 to 98.5.  His white count came down to 7.8.
BUN and creatinine remained stable at 21 and 0.9.  Vancomycin
was discontinued secondary to sensitivity of organisms on
culture.  Patient's blood cultures were finalized as Staph
coag positive sensitive to clindamycin, erythromycin,
gentamicin, levofloxacin, oxacillin, resistant to penicillin.
Anaerobes were also positive.  Urine culture grew
Enterococcus which was sensitive to ampicillin, levofloxacin,
nitrofurantoin, and Vancomycin.  Patient was continued on
levofloxacin until discharge.
