Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2159**]
Chief Complaint:
Pt originally transferred [**2191-6-7**] from [**Hospital3 25148**] in NH to
MICU for management of respiratory failure, hemodynamic
instability, pericardial tamponade, ?adrenal hemorrhage.
Transferred to medical floor on [**2191-6-14**].

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Pericardiocentesis [**2191-6-8**]

History of Present Illness:
69F transferred on [**2191-6-7**] from [**Hospital3 25148**] in NH to MICU
for management of respiratory failure, hemodynamic instability,
pericardial tamponade, and ?adrenal hemorrhage. Pt had been at
[**Hospital1 **] for evaluation/tx of chest pain on [**2191-5-17**].  She had
negative MIBI on [**5-18**], and later in her hospital stay developed
worsening CP and was found to have pericardial effusion on echo.
 She began to develop pericardial tamponade, resp failure, and
hypotension with a question of adrenal hemorrhage, and was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management on [**2191-6-7**].
.
At [**Hospital1 18**] the pt underwent cardiac cath on [**6-8**] for
pericardiocentesis. She also had an elevated WBC count to 79.8
with 99% neutrophils. CT scan showed colitis and she was
continued on antibiotics while C.diff Cx were sent.  Despite the
unclear etiology of her cardiac tamponade and sepsis-like
physiology, the patient's hemodynamic status improved
over the course of the next two days. In the afternoon of [**6-11**],
the patient self-extubated; following extubation her ABG was
7.40/138/75. Over the course of the evening and following day
[**6-12**],
she was intermittently agitated, crying out to/naming people not
in the room, and was unable to follow commands or recall
her name.  Since that time the pt has been followed by
Psychiatry, receiving Valium and now Haldol, with improving
mental status / decreasing agitation.  HD status has been
improving, though with somewhat labile BPs.  Pulmonary status
improving with reduced O2 requirements.

Brief Hospital Course:
69W w/MDS admitted to OSH [**5-17**] with her usual complaint of chest
pain at ECF which was relieved with ntg in OSH ED.  She was
anemic w/hct 25.4.  Her hospital course was notable for
dementia.  CTA showed large pericardial efussion w/?adrenal
hemorrhage.  Also of note, her WBC increased from Bl of 1.9 to
42.5 this AM and to 64.4 at time of xfer.  She had negative MIBI
[**5-18**].

#hypoxic resp insufficiency.  Pt. w/ pneumonia/atelectasis as
likely precipitant.  ?ARDS.  Pt. self extubated 2 nights ago.
- Check ABG
- Check CXR today
- Cont IV abx. Cont Zosyn/Flagyl for pneumonia
.
Hypotension-resolved, due to  sepsis and tamponade, s/p
pericardiocentesis with transient improvement.  source of infxn:
abd vs lung
-cont IV abx to cover cdiff. (zosyn/flagyl)
-keeps MAPs>60s, gently diurese (total body overloaded)
-TTE: effusion stable
.
HTN - pt. w/ increased bps throughout the night - worse w/
agitation.  Pt. not tolerating home bp meds so will continue IV
lopressor.  Will increase this dose
.
Infx: colitis on CT.  cdiff spec pending (x3)- so far negative,
but 1 specimen is pending
.
Elevated WBC- acute leukemic process unlikely.  WBC elevation
likely a leukemoid rxn [**3-10**] infection, likely cdiff.  This is
resolving
-cont to trend

FEN- NPO for now.  On TFs.  Repleting lytes.
.
Code- presumed full
.
Dispo- ICU
.
Access- PIV, TLC, Will d/c A-line b/c pt. pulling at it and pt.
doing well after extubation
.
Psych - pt. w/ depression, ? bipolar - re-started some of pt's
home meds, but she will not consistently take these meds by
mouth
- consider psych consult

Dispo - pt. not requiring ICU care so can consider call out to
the floor w/ a sitter.
