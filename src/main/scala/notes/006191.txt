History of Present Illness:
46yo woman with reported history of autoimmune hepatitis
presented to [**Hospital6 7472**] Emergency Department on
[**2125-2-10**] with complaint of altered mental status. She was
reportedly brought to the ED by her husband on account of
confusion and behavior change (gradual change over about one
week per report). In ED, she was described as agitated and
fighting the ED staff. She was given Ativan and Haldol and
sedated. She was intubated. She was found to be markedly
jaundiced and to have evident bleeding from her nose and mouth.
Otherwise, her husband reported that she had been generally
feeling unwell for the preceding several days. He otherwise
denied her having headache, dizziness, weakness, bleeding,
nausea/vomiting, diarrhea, fever, chills, cough, runny nose,
abdominal pain, dysuria or frequency. He also denied any
depresed mood or suicidal ideation. No reported intentional
ingestion.
.
Her physical exam there was notable for the following: she was
sedated afer receiving Haldol and Ativan. Her vitals were: 36.9,
88, 131/45, rr 30, 90% on RA. She was jaundiced. She had icteric
sclerae. She had ecchymoses on her face and chest. She had blood
in her nose and mouth. Otherwise, lungs were clear to
auscultation. Heart exam normal. Her labs were notable for INR
of 50.7, BUN 53, creat of 6.5 (baseline of 0.9 nine months ago).
Na of 132, K 3.5, Cl 98, bicarb 14, Ca 6.9. T bili of 39.7.
Direct bili 24.9. Indirect bili 14.8. Alk phos 192. Wbc 17.8.
Hct of 27.7. Plts 109. AST 90, ALT 28. Albumin 2.3. Lactate 7.4.
Ammonia 298. EKG was NSR, no acute ischemic findings. She had NG
lavage with "large amount of blood return".

There, she was treated with the following:
. 4units FFP
. 10mg vit K
. solumedrol 100mg
. zosyn
. lactulose 30ml
.
Here, she is intubated, sedated, minimally responsive; no
further history able to be obtained.

Liver Bx at that time c/w autoimmune hepatitis.
2. prior history of cholecystitis and cholelithiasis

Social History:

smoking, ETOH abuse ([**12-19**] glasses of wine weekly), or other
illegal drugs of abuse. She lives in [**Location (un) 3844**].

Brief Hospital Course:
46yo woman with prior history of autoimmune hepatitis/?NASH now
transferred from outside hospital with acute on chronic liver
failure, consumptive coagulopathy, and evolving multisystem
organ failure.
.
# Respiratory Failure: Intubated for airway protection, not
primary respiratory failure. Although over the course of [**2-11**],
patient became more hypoxic likely with a component of
non-cardiogenic pulmonary oedema from all the blood products as
well as aspiration of blood from coagulopathy. Increased PEEP
and decreased TV per ARDSnet protocol.  Patient had an
additional episode of hemoptysis on HD # 9 with suctioning of
copious blood. Covering infectious respiratory issues with
vancomycin (dosing w/daily levels) and Zosyn. A TTE did show
moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. She required
significant and increasing PEEP throughout her hospitalization
to maintain adequate ventilation.
.
# GI: Multiple issues including fulminant liver failure, GIB,
and concern for bowel edema/infection.
1. Liver failure: Likely acute on chronic hepatic failure of
unclear etiology, ? auto-immune hepatitis. Hepatitis, CMV, EBV
serologies all negative. AMA, [**Last Name (un) 15412**] negative. HIV negative.
Ceruloplasmin w/in normal limits. Alpha-1 antitrypsin level
high. There was some suggestion in previous chart of ETOH use,
but pt's husband adamantly denies history. Abdominal ultrasound
showed elevated velocities and elevated diastolic flow in the
hepatic arteries - ? uncertain significance. The systolic
upstrokes were brisk, ? liver hyperemia vs a proximal stenosis.
Liver transplant team consulted and would like to transplant
once urgent issues are stable, but pt is not a candidate as on
CVVH, on pressors, septic. In the setting of worsening
multi-system organ failure, prognosis is extremely poor and pt
is not a candidate for transplantation. A family meeting with
the pt's husband was held on HD #9 and it was decided to not
escalate any further care.  Patient expired due to complications
of liver failure.
.
2. GIB: Pt with continuous bright blood from OG tube since
admission. GI following and no safe indication for endoscopy or
empiric tx for varices at this time. Bleeding likely related to
coagulopathy, and hope to improve as coags improve. Pt had
repeat UGIB on HD#9 with copious fresh blood suctioned from her
OG. After discussion with her husband and the GI service, it was
determined that EGD is not indicated and is not keeping with the
goals of care at this time. She will not receive further blood
products.
.
# Cardiovascular: Pt with tachycardia, hypotension and
persistent pressor need, likely multifactorial related to
multisystem organ failure, sepsis, and dysautonomia. BPs
adequate on pressors to allow diuresis w/CVVH, getting large
volume infusions of blood products. [**Last Name (un) **] stim was depressed,
started [**2-12**] pm on hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone. Initially
weaned off levophed and vasopressin but had persistent BP drop
on [**2-18**] and required reinstitution of levophed. Per pt's husband,
will now have no further escalation of care.
.
# NEURO: Pt had ICP bolt placed for question of monitoring in
setting of acute fulminant liver failure. Now felt to be
acute-on-chronic liver failure, with normal head CT (no evidence
of mass or ICH) and no longer needing bolt. Since bolt has been
discontinued, will stop FFP transfusions and frequent
coagulation monitoring.
.
3. BOWEL WALL EDEMA: CT abdomen with diffuse bowel wall edema,
could be related to general anasarca but cannot r/o
infection/infarction. Pt abdomen distended, firm. Bladder
pressure 13, will continue to monitor daily. Transplant surgery
following but pt is not a candidate for any aggressive
intervention. On abx.
.
# Coagulopathy: With clinically evident bleeding from oral
mucosa and with melena on exam and positive gastric lavage.
Likely consumptive related to whole disease process. Requiring
large volumes of FFP, platelets, pRBCs for ICP monitoring
protocol. Will stop FFP transfusions, as bolt has been removed >
24 hrs. Holding off on heparin SC.
.
# Acute Renal Failure: By outside records, had prior normal
baseline about 9months ago of 0.9; now presented with Creat of
6.5 and anuric.  Started on CVVHD which was eventually stopped.
.
# DNR/DNI, no escalation of care.
.
