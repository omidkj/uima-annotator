Service: CARDIOTHORACIC

Allergies:
Procardia / Isosorbide

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1267**]
Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2106-3-10**] Three Vessel Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting utilizing
left internal mammary to left anterior descending, and vein
grafts to ramus intermedius and posterior descending artery

History of Present Illness:
This 79 year old man has a history of emphysema and an IMI in
[**2085**]. He has never undergone cardiac catheterization and through
the years has been managed on medication only without any
symptoms. He denies any recent chest pain or change in activity
tolerance but does note stable shortness of breath with moderate
exertion which he attributes to his pulmonary disease. This can
occur with climbing two to three flights of stairs, bending down
to pick something up or walking up an incline. The patient is
very hard of hearing and was recently scheduled to have a right
cochlear implant at the [**Location (un) 10866**]. In preparation for
surgery, he was referred for cardiovascular  preoperative
testing as noted below. Because of the results of his testing,
his surgery has been cancelled and the patient has elected to
come back to [**Location (un) 86**] for further cardiology care. Patient denies
PND, orthopnea, edema. He does note some bilateral calf
discomfort with walking approximately five minutes at a fast
pace. The left leg is worse than the right.
Cardiac catheterization on [**2106-3-5**] revealed severe three vessel
disease. Left ventriculography showed a depressed ejection
fraction(46%) with posterobasal akinesis. Coronary angiography
was notable for a right dominant system; the LAD had an 80%
ostial lesion; the ramus had an 80% stenosis; while the
circumflex and right coronary arteries were totally occluded.
Based on the above results, he was referred for cardiac surgical
intervention.

Past Medical History:
Coronary Artery Disease, Prior IMI, Congestive Heart Failure,
Mild to moderate aortic insufficiency, Mild mitral
regurgitation, Emphysema, Hypertension, Hyperlipidemia,
Peripheral Vascular Disease with claudication, Vertigo, Gout,
GERD, Deafness - s/p Cochlear implant, s/p Labyrinthectomy, s/p
Discectomy, Varicocele, s/p Shoulder surgery

Social History:
Patient is married with six children. He lives half of the year
in [**State 108**] and half the year in [**Hospital1 392**]. He previously worked as
an elevator mechanic. Patient's hearing is extremely poor and he
is quite dependent on his wife for communication. He requires
that you speak in a very loud, slow voice as words sound garbled
to him. He does rely on lip [**Location (un) 1131**] to assist in his
communication.

Family History:
Uncle with angina his 60's.

Physical Exam:
Vitals: BP 165/76, HR 64, RR 16, SAT  98% on room air
General: pleasant, well developed male in no acute distress
HEENT: oropharynx benign, upper dentures
Neck: supple, no JVD,
Heart: regular rate, normal s1s2, no murmur or rub
Lungs: clear bilaterally
Abdomen: soft, nontender, normoactive bowel sounds
Ext: warm, no edema, no varicosities
Pulses: 2+ distally
Neuro: nonfocal, hard of hearing

Pertinent Results:
[**2106-2-2**] ETT: 4 minutes 27 seconds [**Doctor First Name **] protocol, 85% max PHR,
stopping due to shortness of breath and fatigue. Immediately
post
exercise the patient was noted to have diffuse pulmonary
wheezing. EKG did not reveal evidence of ischemia with stress.
Imaging was notable for an inferior lateral perfusion defect
that
was moderately reversible. EF noted at 55%.
[**2106-2-2**] echo: Mild concentric LVH with an LVEF of 50-55%.
Moderate MR, moderate AI, mild TR, mild pulmonary hypertension.
[**2106-2-8**] carotid u/s: no significant disease noted.
[**2106-2-8**] ABI's: moderate to severe stenosis of the superficial
femoral and popliteal arteries bilaterally. ABI's 1.0.
Echo [**2106-3-10**]:PRE-CPB: There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is mild global left
ventricular hypokinesis. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%). The ascending aorta is
mildly dilated. There are simple atheroma in the descending
thoracic aorta. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no aortic valve stenosis. Mild to moderate ([**1-18**]+)
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is slight retraction of both mitral
valve leaflets. Moderate (2+) central mitral regurgitation is
seen with systolic blood pressures of around 150 mmHg. At lower
SBP (around 110) the MR is mild to moderate. POST-CPB Normal
biventricular systolic function. Valvular abnormalities noted in
pre-CPB study remain.
CXR [**3-17**]: No CHF with stable left pleural effusion. Sternal wires
in unchanged position.

Brief Hospital Course:
On the day of admission, Mr. [**Known lastname 32793**] [**Last Name (Titles) 1834**] three vessel
coronary artery bypass grafting by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]. The operation was
uneventful - see operative note for further details. Following
the operation, he was brought to the CSRU. Within 24 hours, he
awoke neurologically intact and was extubated. He maintained
stable hemodynamics and transferred to the SDU on postoperative
day two. He experienced bouts of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation
which was treated with Amiodarone. He remained mostly in a
normal sinus rhythm and did not require Warfarin
anticoagulation. On postoperative day five, he displayed new
onset paranoia with visual hallucinations. The timing of his
symptoms did raise the possibility of adverse reaction to
Percocet. He intermittently required Haldol and was assigned to
a one on one sitter for safety. The psych service was consulted
and felt this event was related to narcotic analgesia. Opiates,
benzos and anticholinergics were avoided. Over the next 24
hours, his mental status improved and by discharge, returned to
baseline. Over several days, he continued to make clinical
improvements. Because of some mild sternal drainage, he was
empirically placed on antibiotics. He was eventually cleared for
discharge to home with VNA services on postoperative day 8. At
discharge, his BP was 132/65 with a HR of 88. He will follow-up
with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and his Cardiologist and PCP.
