Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Tapazole

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 348**]
Chief Complaint:
Nausea and vomiting
Transferred to MICU for Medical Complexity

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 58 yo M with DM 1 and ESRD on HD (last HD
yesterday) who presented with nausea and vomiting since this
morning. At that point, his blood sugar was >400, which improved
to 250 after 4 units humalog.

In the ED, the vitals were 97 87 137/88 24 100%. He refused exam
including rectal exam, multiple lab draws and an ECG. His legal
[**First Name3 (LF) 18297**] was not called. He was noted to have coffee grounds
emesis and GI was called. He refused NG tube. He eventually
allowed labs which were notable for a hematocrit of 35, a
respiratory alkalosis and a metabolic acidosis. He eventually
allowed an ECG which showed T wave inversions in the anterior
leads. He was not given any aspirin given concern for GI bleed.
His only access was a 22 gauge and he refused attempts at
additional access.

His father reports that he was recently hospitalized at [**Hospital1 2177**]. He
was admitted threre for hypoglycemia. He was discharged to HD on
saturday and was feeling unwell afterwards. At that time his
blood sugar was 17. He did not complain of nausea/vomiting until
the morning of admission. His father did not observe the emesis
but was not told that there was blood or coffee grounds. He is
not aware of whether the patient had hematochezia or melena.

IMAGING:
CXR [**2129-9-18**]:
Previously noted right basilar consolidative opacity has
essentially resolved. There are mild patchy opacities at the
lung bases most likely reflective of atelectasis though early
infection cannot be completely excluded.

ECHO [**2129-9-19**]
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or
color Doppler. The estimated right atrial pressure is 0-5 mmHg.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular cavity size is top normal/borderline dilated. There
is severe global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 15 %). No
masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. There is no
ventricular septal defect. The right ventricular cavity is
moderately dilated with severe global free wall hypokinesis. The
diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are
normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There
is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests a restrictive
filling abnormality, with elevated left atrial pressure. The
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The pulmonary
artery systolic pressure could not be determined. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. There are no
echocardiographic signs of tamponade.

MICROBIOLOGY:
[**2129-9-19**] BCx: no growth
[**2129-9-19**] MRSA screen: positive

Brief Hospital Course:
58 yo M with DM1, ESRD presenting with nausea/vomiting and ECG
changes, found to have new systolic heart failure with EF of
15%. Had a hypoglycemic episode in the hospital to 12,
transferred to MICU for monitoring. Nausea resolved and blood
glucose better controlled with new regimen and improved
appetite. Family meeting was had to discuss goals of care in
light of his frequent hospitalization for hypoglycemia and this
new systolic heart failure. Patient was made DNR/DNI after the
discussion with his mother and his father (who is his [**Month/Day/Year 18297**]).
Decision was also made that patient cannot return home as it was
considered to be an unsafe environment, so he is being
discharged to rehab.

# Systolic heart failure: The patient presented with symptoms
and ECG changes concerning for ischemia for which Cardiology was
consulted. While there was low suspicion for ACS, an ECHO was
ordered and showed global hypokinesis and EF<15%. Cardiology
recommended cardiac catherization, but patient stated that he
would rather follow up with an outside cardiologist for cardiac
cath and work up of his heart failure. He was started on low
dose ace-inhibitor during his hospitalizat
