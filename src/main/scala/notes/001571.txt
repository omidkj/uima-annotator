Pertinent Labs/Studies:
.
ECG: Sinus tach at 110 bpm. nl axis, borderline QT prolongation.
QT 360. No ST/T changes.
.
Imaging:
[**2169-6-2**] - Portable Chest
The left subclavian line tip is in the level of the junction of
brachiocephalic vein and superior vena cava.  There is no
pneumothorax or apical hematoma.  The heart size is normal.
Mediastinal widening seen on the current chest x-ray is most
probably due to supine position and relatively low
lung volumes.  To exclude hematoma, an erect chest PA and Lat
films should be obtained. The lungs are clear.  There is no
pleural effusion.
.
[**2169-6-2**]: Portable Chest - IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary
process.
.
[**2169-6-6**]: Transesophageal Echocardiogram:
Intravenous sedation was administered as described above. The
patient developed asymptomatic hypotension with a systolic blood
pressure of 70 mm Hg. The patient remained alert and interactive
and did not appear to be sedated. Blood pressure normalized
quickly with intravenous fluids. The patient requested that we
try to complete the test. One attempt was made at passing the
TEE probe, however, the patient was unable to swallow it. The
test was terminated. If a TEE is still clinically necessary, an
anesthesiologist will be needed to provide deeper sedation and
blood pressure support.
.
[**2169-6-6**] - Echocardiogram (TTE)
Conclusions:
1. The left atrium is mildly dilated.
2. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Regional left
ventricular wall motion is normal. Left ventricular systolic
function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
3. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. No aortic
regurgitation is seen.
4. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial
mitral
regurgitation is seen.
5. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
6. No evidence of endocarditis seen.
7. Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2169-5-3**],
there is no significant change.
.
[**2169-6-7**]: IMPRESSION: Successful placement of a 40cm single lumen
left brachial vein PICC line. The tip is in the SVC. The line is
ready for use.
.
[**2169-6-7**]: Chest Pa/Lat - IMPRESSION:  Small right pleural
effusion.  Prominent mediastinum likely due to mediastinal fat.
.
[**2169-6-8**]: IMPRESSION:  Successful placement of a 46 cm
single-lumen PICC through the left brachial vein with the tip in
the superior vena cava.  The line is ready for use.
