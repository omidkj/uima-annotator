Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2777**]
Chief Complaint:
wound and aortic graft infection

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
1. Removal of infected aortic graft, aorto left femoral bypass
using femoral vein, right iliofemoral bypass using thigh femoral
vein, sartorius flap myoplasty of the left femoral anastomosis.

2. Planned staged delayed closure of open abdomen.

3. Abdominal washout and closure of abdomen

4. Placement of percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy wound tube.


History of Present Illness:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 61643**] is a 53 yr old F well known to the vascular surgery
service. She has a history significant for aortobifemoral bypass
in [**2154**] with subsequent right iliofemoral bypass and revision of
anastamosis for graft infection in [**5-3**] with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
She subsequently had multiple admissions for wound infections of
her right groin with exposed graft material. Her most recent
hospitalization was a 7 week hospital stay from [**2160-8-24**] to
[**2160-10-24**]. This resulted in VAC placement and eventual healing
of her right groin wound. She presents today with skin breakdown
of the right groin incision x 1 day and reports a small amount
of purulent drainage. She denies any fevers, chills or other
constitutional symptoms. She denies any ischemic pain or
claudication. Her ROS is otherwise WNL.

12. PVD
13. Question of ADEM (acute disseminated encephalomyelitis)
versus vascular disease. Per neurology note, she has undergone
MRI of her brain in [**2153**] and [**2155**] without any new findings. This
makes the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis highly unlikely. From
Dr.[**Name (NI) 98002**] note, back in the early [**2150**], there was some
question that she had, acute demyelinating event, which
typically is just one flare similar to that seen in MS, but no
recurrence. Alternatively, her symptoms might have a vascular
nature. She remains on Plavix for this reason.

CTA abd/pelvis ([**2161-1-18**]):
1. In this patient status post aortofemoral bypass complicated
by revision of right iliofemoral bypass, there is an open right
groin wound extending up to the level of the graft. The soft
tissue density lesion surrounding the graft at the right femoral
anatomosis to the level of the common femoral artery bifurcation
is stable. An infection cannot be excluded in this region. No
drainable fluid collections are seen.

2. Unchanged appearance of the graft in the lower extremity
vessels. Patent aortoiliac bifemoral graft. Chronically occluded
right SFA with distal  reconstitution of the right popliteal
artery. Stable aneurysm of the left common femoral artery,
patent left common, superficial and profunda femoral arteries.

EKG ([**2161-1-19**]): Sinus rhythm. Delayed R wave progression is
non-specific and may be within normal limits. Since the previous
tracing of [**2160-9-19**] delayed R wave progression has replaced early
precordial QRS transition.

EEG ([**2161-1-31**]): This EEG gives evidence for a continuous severe
disturbance
of fucntion over the entire left hemisphere that appears maximum
centrally and temporally. There is some relative preservation of
the background rhythm posteriorly but there is a striking
difference between the two hemispheres. Additionally, there are
clear interictal epileptic discharges from the left mid-temporal
region although no sustained seizure discharges were observed or
noted.

MRI/MRA brain/neck ([**2161-2-1**]): Large acute left middle cerebral
artery territory infarct. Near-complete occlusion of the left
internal carotid artery.

Echo ([**2161-2-2**]): The left atrium is normal in size. No
thrombus/mass is seen in the body of the left atrium. No atrial
septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color
Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers. Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are
normal (LVEF >55%). No masses or thrombi are seen in the left
ventricle. There is no ventricular septal defect. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good
leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. No masses or
vegetations are seen on the aortic valve. No mass or vegetation
is seen on the mitral valve. The estimated pulmonary artery
systolic pressure is normal. There is no pericardial effusion.

EEG ([**2161-2-3**]): This almost four-hour recording continues to show
persistent slowing over the left hemisphere maximum over the
more anterior central regions but it does seem to affect the
posterior background regulation. Also, occasional interictal
epileptic activity in the form of spike wave discharges are
noted from the left temporal region. The background on the right
is also borderline slow suggesting perhaps a more diffuse
generalized encephalopathy.


Brief Hospital Course:
Patient was admitted to the Vascular Surgery service with an
infected aortic graft and was taken to the OR for removal of
infected aortic graft, aorto left femoral bypass using femoral
vein, right iliofemoral bypass using thigh femoral vein,
sartorius flap myoplasty of the left femoral anastomosis on
hospital day 3.  This was complicated by delayed closure of
abdomen and she underwent staged abdominal closure and left MCA
stroke.  She later underwentplacement of percutaneous endoscopic
gastrostomy tube for nutrition.

Neuro: She was initially intubated and sedated in the ICU
pending abdominal closure.  When sedation was withdrawn she did
not wake up and she was found to have experienced a left MCA
stroke.  She was initially placed on nicardipine drip and SBP
was maintained <150.  She was transi
