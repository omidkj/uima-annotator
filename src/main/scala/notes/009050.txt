Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7651**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest pain of sudden onset.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac catheterization and placement of drug-eluting stent to
RCA


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 54731**] is an 81yo M with history of HTN, questionable
dyslipidemia and OSA, admitted to 6-CCU on [**2132-8-18**] via ED, w/
complaint of one hour episode of substernal chest
pressure/tightness radiating up into the neck awaking him from
sleep.  The pain was associated with diaphoresis but no
shortness of breath.  His wife gave him a full aspirin and the
pain went away.  She called EMS, and he was chest pain free upon
available to the ER.
.
In the ER, initial vitals were 97.5, 84, 162/80, 16, 97% 2L NC.
Initital EKG showed first degree AV block and ST elevations in
the inferior leads.  While in the ED, his CP recurred, and he
was sent to the cath lab as a [**Year (4 digits) **].  He was plavix loaded with
600mg, started on heparin drip and given morphine.  Patient was
hemodynamically stable the whole time with heart rates in the
80s and blood pressures 150s-160s/80s.
.
In the cath lab, he had a subtotal ostium PL branch RCA lesion
and DES was placed.  He developed increased respiratory distress
with some coughing and questionable SVT with cough.  Patient
received lasix 20mg IV for this and was transiently on NRB.  His
PCW on cath was 33.
.
On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
He denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other
review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of current
chest pain, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle
edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.  Upon reflection, he
has felt more fatigued that usual with exertion but denies frank
dyspnea.

IMAGING
[**2132-8-18**] CARDIAC CATH:
1. Coronary angiography in this right dominat system
demonstrated single
vessel disease. The LMCA was patent. The LAD had <50% proximal
stenosis,
and diffuse irregularities. The LCX had no angiographically
apparent
disease. The RCA had a subtotal ostium occlusion posterolateral
branch.
2. Resting hemodynamics revealed elevated right and left sided
filling
pressures with RVEDP of 16 mmHg and PCW of 33 mm Hg. There was
moderate
pulmonary arterial systolic hypertension with PASP 54 mm Hg. The
cardiac
index was low at 2.2 L/min/min2. There was normal arterial
systolic and
mildly elevated diastolic pressures at the aortic level with sBP
136
mmHg and DBP of 94 mmHg.
3. Left Ventriculography was differed.
4. Successful PTCA and stenting of the distal RCA into the PL
branch
with a 3.0 x 18 mm Promus DES (see PTCA comments).
5. Successful LFA AngioSeal (see PTCA comments).
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Single vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Moderate biventricular diastolic dysfunction.
3. Moderate pulmonary arterial hypertension.
4. Successful PCI of the distal RCA into the RPL with a 3.0 x 18
mm
Promus DES.
5. Successful LFA AngioSeal.
.
[**2132-8-18**] ECG: Sinus rhythm. A-V conduction delay. ST segment
elevations in
leads II, III and aVF with ST segment depressions in leads V2-V3
and V5-V6
and leads I and aVL consistent with acute transmural ischemia in
the
inferoposterior distribution. Relatively flat ST segment in lead
V1
raises suspicion for acute right ventricular infarction.
Compared to the
previous tracing ST segment changes are new.
.
[**2132-8-18**] Trans-thoracic Echocardiography
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is mild
to moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
severe hypokinesis of the basal inferior and inferolateral
walls. The remaining segments contract normally (LVEF = 45-50
%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal. The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
The ascending aorta and arch are mildly dilated.The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
present. Mild to moderate ([**11-25**]+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild to moderate
([**11-25**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary artery
systolic pressure could not be determined. There is no
pericardial effusion.
.
IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
regional systolic dysfunction c/w CAD (PDA distribution).
Mild-moderate aortic regurgitation. Mild-moderate mitral
regurgitation. Dilated thoracic aorta.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 54731**] is a 81yo M with history of HTN and OSA, who was
admitted with an inferior [**Known lastname **].
