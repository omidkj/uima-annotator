Admission Date:  [**2195-7-5**]     Discharge Date:  [**2195-7-8**]


Service:  CCU

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a [**Age over 90 **] year old male with
three vessel coronary artery disease with a history of atrial
fibrillation, congestive heart failure and ejection fraction
of 55%, chronic renal insufficiency, and hypertension, who
was sent to the Emergency Department from home after being
noted to have shortness of breath at home.  Very scant
records, but per the home health aid, the patient was found
to be mottled with rales half way up.  The patient received
sublingual Nitroglycerin times two and 80 mg of Lasix
intravenous with urine output.  In the Emergency Department,
the patient was noted to be in pulmonary edema and also
developed sustained ventricular tachycardia for two minutes
with hypotension.  He was started on Amiodarone drip.  The
patient was also put on BiPAP for signs of hypoxia.  At that
point, there was discussion with the family and with the
patient and he was confirmed to be DNR/DNI, no shocks, no
pressors, no catheterizations.  The patient was then
transferred to the CCU where his blood pressure was 96/54,
heart rate 70, respiratory rate 16, 100% nonrebreather mask.
The patient denied chest pressure or chest pain and states
that his shortness of breath had improved.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission, in general, the patient
was responsive to voice, breathing more comfortably,
temperature 97.4, blood pressure 97/47, heart rate 79,
respiratory rate 20, oxygen saturation 100% on nonrebreather
mask.  Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat - The pupils are
equal, round, and reactive to light and accommodation.
Extraocular movements are intact.  Sclera nonicteric.  Neck
was supple with jugular venous distention at eight
centimeters.  The lungs had decreased breath sounds at the
bases, rales two thirds of the way up.  Cardiovascular was
regular rate and rhythm, with II to III/VI systolic ejection
murmur at the left lower sternal border.  The abdomen was
soft, nontender, nondistended.  Hemoccult positive per the
Emergency Department.  Extremities showed no edema.

LABORATORY DATA:  White blood cell count was 18.1, hemoglobin
13.6, hematocrit 43.0, platelet count 276,000.  Sodium 139,
potassium 4.5, chloride 102, bicarbonate 16, blood urea
nitrogen 36, creatinine 1.5, glucose 313.  CK 194, troponin
1.1, and Digoxin level was less than 0.3. The urinalysis was
within normal limits.

The first electrocardiogram at 3:15 a.m. showed atrial
fibrillation at 105 beats per minute with a left axis
deviation, wide QRS complexes with frequent ectopy, ST
depressions in V4 through V6.  The electrocardiogram at 6:55
a.m. showed a sinus rhythm at 70 beats per minute with left
axis deviation, prolonged PR interval.  This was post
Amiodarone.  ST depression 2.0 millimeters in V4 through V6
and in aVL.  Chest x-ray showed pronounced congestive heart
failure with volume overload and bilateral small pleural
effusions.

On [**2195-7-6**], the patient ruled in with a peak CK of 432 and
MB fraction of 79. The Amiodarone was discontinued and Heparin
was started. Lopressor dose was increased and the patient also
was noted to have some intermittent nonsustained ventricular
tachycardia, three beats on the monitor.  On the evening of
[**2195-7-6**], the Metoprolol was held for bradycardia and in
addition, there was an echocardiogram that was performed
which showed severe impairment in the left ventricular
function compared with the echocardiogram of [**4-14**].  Of note,
the echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction of 20 to 30%
with anteroapical hypokinesis, mild aortic insufficiency,
mild to moderate mitral regurgitation, diastolic dysfunction,
severe dilation of the left ventricle with a normal
thickness.  As a result of the low ejection fraction, the
patient was then started on Lisinopril 5 mg p.o.  He
tolerated this quite well.  On [**2195-7-7**], the patient
continued to remain hemodynamically stable and remained in
normal sinus rhythm.

His discharge plans were discussed and there was an extensive
discussion regarding anticoagulation, however, it was felt
that at this time given the patient's age and risk of falling
that anticoagulation would not be opted for despite the fact
that the patient has atrial fibrillation as well as wall
motion abnormalities.  The final decision regarding
anticoagulation will be up to the patient's primary care
physician, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1266**].  The patient was advised to
follow-up with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1266**] in two to three days for
renal function tests as the patient was started on once daily
Lisinopril 5 mg tablet one tablet p.o. once daily.
