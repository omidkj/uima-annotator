hypotension with a BP of 80/60.  During this hypotensive
episode, the pt was asymptomatic without lightheadedness,
dizziness, chest pain or shortness of breath.  Her BP responded
to a 1 liter bolus of LR and she was transferred to the ICU for
more intensive monitoring.  Serial Hcts were checked which
remained stable.  EKG and cardiac enzymes were also checked
which were normal.  She remained normotensive and continued to
have adequate urine output and was transferred to the floor the
following day.  She had a barium swallow/upper GI study on
post-op day 1 which revealed no evidence of contrast
extravasation or obstruction.  She was started on a Stage 1

was well controlled on oral pain medications.  For the pt's
