History of Present Illness:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 13469**] is a 66 year-old female with primary sclerosing
cholangitis and cirrhosis awaiting liver transplant (MELD 18)
who presented to [**Hospital 3585**] clinic with lethargy, confusion and
dyspnea.  Per her daughter who brought her to the clinic, she
has been increasing sleepy over the previous 3 days with a
decrease in her activity level throughout the day.  She has been
drinking but has not been eating much.  She last ate yesterday
morning.  She did not hear of any other complaints including no
complaints of fevers, chills, nausea, vomiting, chest pain,
shortness-of-breath.  She presented for her routine follow-up
today with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 10924**] and was found to have a blood pressure in
the 80s with confusion and dyspnea was sent emergently to the
emergency department.

She was last seen by [**Doctor Last Name **] on [**2166-12-17**] where she
had dyspnea but did complain of increased pruritus, weight gain,
and difficulty with thoughts.  She was continued on Lasix 40 mg
and Aldactone 100 mg and noted to not be taking Rifaximin (not
covered by insurance) or Lactulose (history of colitis).  She
was started on Augmentin for prophylaxis, magnesium leg cramps,
and naltrexone for itching.

In the ED, her initial BP vitals were 96.5, HR 70, BP 105/38, RR
14 with an O2 sat 100% on 6 liters.  Chest xray showed no acute
cardiopulmonary process and a RUQ US showed only cholelithiasis,
no signs of cholecystitis.  She became increasing dyspneic and
agitated and was intubated in the emergency room.

CXR [**2167-2-15**]: Two views. Comparison with the previous study done
[**2167-2-11**]. There is blunting of the right costophrenic sulcus
consistent with a small effusion.  The lungs are otherwise
clear. The heart is at the upper limit of normal in size. The
aorta is tortuous and calcified. Mediastinal structures are
otherwise unremarkable. The patient has been extubated. A
feeding tube remains in place. A right internal jugular catheter
and left PICC line has been inserted and terminates in the
region of the upper superior vena cava.
.
ECHO [**2167-2-6**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular
wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. Regional left
ventricular wall motion is normal. Left ventricular systolic
function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%). Right ventricular chamber
size and free wall motion are normal. The diameters of aorta at
the sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is mild aortic
valve stenosis (valve area 1.2-1.9cm2; gradients are higher than
usually seen in mild AS because of high stroke volume/cardiac
output). No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. There is mild
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
effusion.

IMPRESSION: Hyperdynamic left ventricular systolic function.
Mild aortic stenosis. Mild pulmonary hypertension.
.
CT head [**2167-2-5**]: IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial hemorrhage.
.
RUQ ultrasound [**2167-2-5**]: IMPRESSION: Cholelithiasis without
evidence for cholecystitis. Unchanged mild intrahepatic biliary
dilatation in the left lobe.
.
Fluoro guided NJ tube placement [**2167-2-9**]: IMPRESSION: Removal of
the patient's OG and Dobhoff tube with placement of a feeding
tube with the tip now in the proximal jejunum.
.
ECG [**2167-2-12**]: Baseline artifact. Sinus rhythm. Diffuse mode
