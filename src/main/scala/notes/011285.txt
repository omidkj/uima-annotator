Pertinent Results:
IMAGING:
[**11-14**]: CT Head: Small bifrontal subdural hemorrhages. Small right
frontal subarachnoidhemorrhage. Left-sided occipital bone
fracture with extension into the rightsphenoid sinus and right
sphenoid sinus hemorrhage.
[**11-14**]: CT cystogram: 1) Extraperitoneal hematoma adjacent to left
superior pubic rammus fracuture, intracystic hematoma. small
contrast extravasation at that site --> focal extraperitoneal
bladder rupture
2) left superior and inferior pubic rami, right parasymphyseal
and left sacral fractures
[**11-14**]: CT C-Spine:Skull base fracture through the left side of
the occipital bone with extension to the right sphenoid sinus
and right sphenoid sinus hemorrhage. Otherwise, no traumatic
cervical spine injury.
[**11-14**]: CT Torso: 1. Left hemi-sacral and superior and inferior
pubic rami fractures, consistent with a lateral compression
(type I) fracture. There is also a right parasymphyseal pelvic
fracture. No associated hemorrhage is visualized in the pelvis.
Left clavicular fracture with no visualized associated
hemorrhage.
[**11-14**]: CXR: There is a minimally comminuted fracture involving
the distal left clavicle. No displaced fractures are noted
elsewhere.
[**11-14**]: L Elbow: Position was somewhat limited. However, grossly
no fracture or dislocation is evident. Alignment is anatomic. No
large joint effusion is noted. A very thin linear opacity
projects just proximal to the olecranon on lateral view in an
area of mild soft tissue swelling. Correlate clinically for
possible embedded radiopaque foreign body.
[**11-14**]: R Knee/Tib/Fib: Nondisplaced fracture of fibular head

Brief Hospital Course:
She was admitted to the ACS service and transferred to the
Trauma ICU for hemodynamic monitoring and Q1H neuro checks. She
was seen by neurosurgery and loaded with Dilantin which will
continue for 7 days for prophylaxis. Serial head CT scans were
done, repeat imaging showing no new foci of intracranial
hemorrhage, no developing hydrocephalus and no intraventricular
hemorrhagic extension. Her mental status is wake, alert and
oriented x3.

She was also evaluated by Orthopedics for her left clavicle
which was closed treated with a sling; her sacral fracture was
non operative and her right knee avulsion fracture was treated
with a hinged knee brace. She may weight bear as tolerated on
all extremities and follow up in [**Hospital 1957**] clinic in 2 weeks.

She was noted with an extraperitoneal bladder injury requiring
that a Foley catheter remain in place for at least 7 days. She
will have an outpatient cystogram and follow up in [**Hospital 2536**] clinic
