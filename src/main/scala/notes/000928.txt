Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2186**]
Chief Complaint:
Saddle pulmonary embolus

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
IVC filter placement by interventional radiology [**2183-5-30**]

History of Present Illness:
Pt is a 79 y/o F with unknown PMHx, who presented to the ED with
generalized weakness and DOE for the past week. She presented
earlier this week to her PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 1023**] was planning ot see her in
follow-up on Friday. However, her symptoms progressed, and she
ultimately presented to an OSH ED today, where she was found to
have a large saddle pulmonary embolus. While at the OSH, she
received 100 mg tpa. She was hypoxic to the 80's on NC and was
placed on NRB.

On arrival to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, she was started on a heparin gtt
after her tpa was completed. Labs were significant for troponin
0.11, BNP 3456, lactate 4.8. Per report, K was low at OSH;
repeat here was 5.2 but was hemolyzed. WBC 18.7. CXR was
unremarkable. Bedside ultrasound was performed and "generous" RV
with some septal bowing during systole. ECG showed TWI in V1-V4.
BP's were borderline in the ED; she received a total of 1 L NS.
VS prior to transfer BP 98/50, HR 75, 100% on NC.

On arrival to the MICU, the patient endorsed some mild SSCP that
was non-radiating. She reports chronic BLE swelling and
tightness, which has been worse recently (R>L). No other
complaints.

Past Medical History:
- lower extremity edema
- HTN
- "phlebitis" vs. DVT during her pregnancies
- GERD
- insomnia

CHEST X-RAY ([**2183-5-28**]): Single AP portable chest radiograph was
provided.  Subtle hazy opacity at the right base which may
represent atelectasis; however, early infection cannot be
excluded.  The lungs are otherwise clear.  There is no pleural
effusion or pneumothorax.  Heart size is top normal; however,
this may be due to AP projection.  There are no acute skeletal
abnormalities. IMPRESSION:  Subtle hazy opacity right base is
most likely atelectasis but cannot exclude early infectious
process.

LOWER EXTREMITY DOPPLER [**2183-5-29**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. Deep venous thrombosis involving the right mid femoral vein
extending into the popliteal vein.  No evidence of below-knee
DVT on the right side.
2. On the left side there is non-occlusive thrombus in the
popliteal vein
extending into the left peroneal vein.

ECHOCARDIOGRAM [**2183-5-30**]:
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF 65%). The right ventricular free wall is hypertrophied.
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with depressed
free wall contractility. There are focal calcifications in the
aortic arch. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened
but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial
mitral regurgitation. There is no mitral valve prolapse. There
is no pericardial effusion.

IVC FILTER PLACEMENT [**2183-5-30**]:
IMPRESSION:
1.  Placement of a Bard Eclipse IVC filter into the infrarenal
inferior vena cava via a femoral approach.
2.  No evidence of IVC thrombus or IVC duplication anomalies on
IVC venogram which preceded IVC filter placement.

Brief Hospital Course:
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
[ ] Restarting home antihypertensives as patient's clinical
status stabilizes. Pt was restarted on 5 mg of lisinopril (20 mg
daily at home). Her metoprolol was held as we did not want to
interfere with compensatory tachycardia if pt needed it (home
dose 50 mg metoprolol succinate daily). She had recently been
started on diltiazem, which was stopped.
[ ] Lasix was also held as we did not want to decrease her
preload, and the recently increased swelling were thought to be
due to DVT. It can be restarted in the future if lower extremity
swelling does not improve with treatment of DVT.
[ ] Patient will need to make sure that her cancer screening is
up to date as an outpatient to rule out hypercoagulable state.
Hypercoagulable work up is not recommended during this acute
episode of clot, but can be considered in the future.
[ ] Patient will also need an appointment with interventional
radiology to remove the retrievable IVC filter in about [**3-28**]
weeks. IR is aware and will be contacting the patient to make
the appointment.
============================

79 yo F with PMH of chronic lower extremity swelling and HTN who
presented to the ED with generalized weakness and DOE for the
past week, found to have saddle PE and bilateral DVT, now s/p
TPA and on heparin gtt/coumadin. Pt also had troponin leak to
0.11 and evidence of right heart strain on bedside
echocardiogram so underwent IVC filter placement to prevent
further clot burden. She was continued on heparin gtt/coumadin
until her INR was therapeutic.

# PE/bilateral DVT: Pt is now s/p TPA and on heparin
