Allergies:
Sulfa (Sulfonamides)

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1145**]
Chief Complaint:
shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
cardiac catheterization, intubation

History of Present Illness:
86 yo F with h/o HTN, CAD s/p remote CABG, DM who presents from
NH with acute SOB and diaphoresis, transferred here for NSTEMI,
admitted to CCU s/p cath on IABP, pressors, and intubated.  She
received lasix and NTG at [**Hospital1 18**] [**Location (un) 620**] and was transferred
here.  Her ECG on arrival showed [**Street Address(2) 2051**] depressions in V4-V6,
II, avF.  Cardiac enzymes were positive with CK 827/105/12.7 and
Trop 1.02.  CXR showed edema and RUL infiltrate; she was given
ceftriaxone 1g, azithromycin 500, and clindamycin 600 and lasix
40IV.  She received ASA, plavix 600, and heparin bolus.  She
underwent catheterization, showing severely elevated left and
right-sided filling pressures (mean PCWP 30, giant v-waves).
Grafts from SVG-> LAD and SVG -> RCA were patent.  LAD had
diffuse proximal disease.  No prior LCx graft was found; LCx had
90% proximal occlusion and mid 70% which were stented.  ACT
returned as 85 (later attributed to heparin infiltration in
peripheral IV).  The patient became hypotensive and went into
respiratory distress.  Her LCx was found to have a fresh
thrombus, as well as new thrombus in the LMCA.  She was
intubated and placed on a balloon pump.  Dopamine and levophed
were started.  Integrillin was started.  The LCx was restented
twice.
.
On arrival to the floor the patient was noted to be
significantly oozing from the groin.  Vascular surgery was
consulted and applied Femstop to stop bleeding.  She received 1
unit pRBCs.  Integrillin gtt was stopped.  dopa @ 5, levo @ 0.16

Micro:
Fungal Swab:
FUNGAL CULTURE (Preliminary):
      NO FUNGUS ISOLATED.
      A swab is not the optimal specimen for recovery of
mycobacteria or
      filamentous fungi.  A negative result should be
interpreted with
      caution.  Whenever possible tissue biopsy or aspirated
fluid should
      be submitted.
.
Chest X Ray [**2101-8-15**]:
Severe pulmonary edema has worsened again obscuring the cardiac
silhouette which is not particularly large. There is more
mediastinal vascular engorgement and at least small bilateral
pleural effusions are presumed. No pneumothorax. ET tube and
nasogastric tube in standard placements.


Brief Hospital Course:
<b>Assessment and Plan:  86 yo F with h/o HTN, CAD s/p remote
CABG, DM who presents from NH with acute SOB and diaphoresis,
transferred here for NSTEMI, admitted to CCU s/p cath on IABP,
pressors, and intubated.
.
Cardiac:
Pump: The patient developed cardiogenic shock while in the cath
lab, requiring placement of IABP and support with pressors.  CI
and SVR gradually improved, allowing discontinuation of the IABP
and pressors. The patient remained volume overloaded and was
therefore diuresed with IV lasix and responded very well.
However, she continuously dropped her BP and required
intermittent fluid boluses to maintain her BP.  Blood
transufions were also given during her episodes of hypotension
to encourage fluid mobilization and maintain her hematocrit.
Her CXR initially improved.  However, she did continue to have
patchy infiltrates despite good duresis.  At the time of her
death, she did have diffuse course breath sounds.
.
Ischemia: She had an infero/anterolateral MI, was s/p cath for
NSTEMI and LCx stenting. The patient was not treated with
intergrillin due to bleeding/oozing from groin sites. She was
continued on aspirin, and plavix.  Atorvastatin 80 mg qday was
held for 2 days post cath for concern of drug fever, however, as
her fevers continued without the medication it was restarted.
She was started on a betablocker despite transient hypotension.
The CCU team stopped following her cardiac enzymes, and
continued her medical regimen up until the time of her death.
.
Rhythym: The patient had an episode of SVT (afib vs aflutter) on
[**2101-8-11**], which broke with metoprolol IV and PO.  She was then
continued on metoprolol.  She was monitored on telemetry
throughout her hospitalization.  She maintained her rhythm up
until her death, eventually ending in asystole.
.
Respiratory failure: The patient was intubated in the cath lab.
She was thought to be in heart failure post cath, and so was
diuresed with IV lasix, however, ARDS was also on the
differential given he
