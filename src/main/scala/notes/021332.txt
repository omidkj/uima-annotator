Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 562**]
Chief Complaint:
dental abscess s/p I&D

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
incision and drainage of dental abscesses X 2 by OMFS

History of Present Illness:
Ms [**Known lastname 81697**] is a 70 year-old female with pmh of chronic
vertigo secondary to a concussion, hypertension, and depression
who was admitted on [**7-12**] after undergoing I&D of a dental
abscess.  She states she developed right lower, back gum pain
last Tuesday which worsened over the course of the week.  She
felt it starting invovling her "glands" in her neck, first on
the right side, but then progressively to her left side.  She
admits to pain with swallowing.  She denies history of dental
abscess, fevers, chills, or other symptoms.

She went for the I&D of her abscess by OMFS without
complication.  She was admitted to trauma surgery afterwards,
however since her infection was not traumatic, she was
transferred to medicine for further care.

Currently she admits to occasional pain which responds to
morphine as well as pain with swallowing and nausea.  She also
has occasional SOB, but no CP.  Slight cough.

Review of Systems:
(+) Per HPI
(-) Denies chest pain or tightness, palpitations. Denied
vomiting, diarrhea, constipation or abdominal pain. No recent
change in bowel or bladder habits. No dysuria. Denies
arthralgias or myalgias.  No numbness/tingling in extremities.
No feelings of depression or anxiety. All other review of
systems negative.

Past Medical History:
HTN
HLD
Depression
Chronic vertigo secondary to a head inury sustained 20 years
while playing volleyball

Social History:
She lives alone.  She is unable to work due to her chronic
vertigo.  She smokes [**3-6**] cigarettes per day.  Denies drug or
alcohol use.

CT neck [**7-19**]
FINDINGS: A large heterogeneous collection in the submandibular
space has
decreased in size. The largest rim-enhancing pocket measures 4.3
x 0.9 cm,
decreased from 5.0 x 1.6 cm. There is edema surrounding this
lesion,
decreased from prior. Additional drains have been instilled in
the interval.  Posterior and leftward shift of the airway
persists, although decreased and difficult to exactly determine
now the patient is intubated. Air-fluid level is in bilateral
maxillary sinuses. A likely orogastric tube is also seen.
Retropharyngeal tissues are difficult to assess status post
intubation. No mediastinal fat stranding or area of focal
consolidation is seen in the lung.  No cervical lymph nodes are
pathologically enlarged. No thrombosis of the neck vessels is
demonstrated. There are no osseous findings to suggest
osteomyelitis.

IMPRESSION: Interval decrease in large submandibular abscess
with apparent
decrease, but persistent displacement of the airway which is now
intubated.  For the detection of osteomyelitis, MR is more
sensitive.

CT neck [**7-12**]
FINDINGS: There is a hypodense collection containing foci of air
immediately adjacent and medial to the right submandibular gland
and lateral to the right mylohyoid muscle consistent with an
abscess, with the largest pocket measuring 12 x 16 x 29 mm.
There is no evidence of odontogenic infection or sialolith.
There is no evidence of retropharyngeal abscess. The airways
appear patent.  There is some fluid within the right pyriform
sinus.

No cervical lymph nodes meet CT size criteria for pathologic
enlargement. The carotid vessels and their branches appear
unremarkable. The great vessels appear unremarkable. There is no
mediastinal or hilar lymphadenopathy.

The visualized lungs show mild emphysematous changes.

Degenerative changes are seen within the cervical spine, most
prominent at
C4-C5, C5-C6. There is no evidence of prevertebral soft tissue
swelling.

IMPRESSION:
1. Abscess, medial and adjacent to the right submandibular gland
and lateral to the right mylohyoid. No definite odontogenic
infection or sialolith identified.
2. Fluid within the right piriform sinus.
3. Degenerative changes at C4-C5 and C5-C6 with no prevertebral
soft tissue swelling.

CXR [**7-22**]
FINDINGS: Cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged. Endotracheal
tube has
been removed and other support devices are unchanged in
position. Worsening of bibasilar atelectasis and persistent
small bilateral pleural effusions.

         This organism may develop resistance to third
generation
         cephalosporins during prolonged therapy. Therefore,
isolates that
         are initially susceptible may become resistant within
three to
         four days after initiation of therapy.  For serious
infections,
         repeat culture and sensitivity testing may therefore be
warranted
         if third generation cephalosporins were used.
