abdominal pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Echocardiography

History of Present Illness:
59 year old man with PMH significant for CAD s/p CABG and
stents; atrial fibrillation; ETOH abuse; and pancreatitis.
Presented to ED w/ severe [**9-4**] epigastric pain radiating to
back.  Admitted to ED with suspected severe pancreatitis
recurrence.
.
In the ED, VS were 98.8 73 [**Telephone/Fax (2) 51055**]% RA. Labs were
significant for a lipase of 4276 and an amylase of 761. He also
had an anion gap of 28. A surgery consult was obtained but did
not feel that pt had current surgical needs.  Imaging revealed
uncomplicated pancreatitis.
.
He was initially planned to be admitted to the floor, but then
CXR showed new pulmonary edema, and there was concern over
giving iv fluids on the floor and so Mr. [**Known lastname 51051**] was admitted
to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for further monitoring and treatment. [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] course
included:
-Aggresive IVF and dilaudid PCA for pain control
-Increasing abdominal distension, pt passing flatus, NGT was
placed for decompression which he self-dc'd c/o severe
discomfort.
- TTE showed mild LVH, preserved biventricular systolic function
- He was placed on a CIWA scale for DT but did not need any
valium
- Electrolytes were aggresively repleted
.
He was called out to the floor on [**11-8**] but did not receive a
bed until [**11-10**] at 11pm.
.
On [**11-11**] in a.m. of admission to main team on floor, he c/o very
little abd pain ([**1-4**] epigastric), was able to ambulate w/o
difficulty and Foley to d/c'ed; requesting PO intake.


Past Medical History:
1. Atrial fibrillation- Pt developed atrial fibrillation
approximately twelve years ago. He reports that he was
anticoagulated on coumadin for several years. He was then placed
on amiodarone following his CABG in [**2120**] and converted to sinus
rhythm. He was then taken off the anticoagulation and has
remained in sinus rhythem per his report.
2. Coronary artery disease- Pt is s/p one vessel CABG from the
LIMA to the LAD on [**2121-10-17**]. He then went to cardiac cath on
[**2121-10-20**] at which time three stents were placed to the RCA and
one to the distal circumflex. He has not had any further stress
tests since that time. His cardiologist is Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 122**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].

3. Pancreatitis- First episode of pancreatitis was in [**2103**]. He
has had approximately 10 flares since that time. He reports that
his current pain is epigastric when in the past his
"pancreatitis" pain was more localized to his left lower
abdomen/flank.
4. Ethanol abuse- Pt denies any history of DTS. He reports that
he normally quits drinking for a couple of months each winter
with [**Last Name **] problem. However, there is a record of an episode of DTs
at an OSH in [**2119**]. He attributes these symtpoms to receiving too
much ativan.
5. Hypertriglyceridemia
6. Hypertension
7. Gout
8. Spinal stenosis
9. MRSA infection- Pt had a MRSA PNA at an OSH when he was
intubated during an episode of pancreatitis. He had a sputum
positive for MRSA here at [**Hospital1 18**] in [**2120**].

Social History:
5 pack-year smoking hx, quit 30 years ago.  Longstanding hx of
EtOH consumption, three double-EtOH drinks/day.  Works as
insurance salesman.

Family History:
Significant for hypertriglyceridemia though no FH of early-onset
CAD


Physical Exam:
VS 99.5 90  154/94 24  93% RA  UOP 775 cc on morning of [**11-11**],
substantial increase over ED
Gen/psych- AOX3.  He is alert and ambulating.  He has some
insight into his illness though seems confused into thinking
that some of our interventions are causing the problems which
they are actually treating.  Seems intermittently agitated, not
at staff but very frustrated about his general health, observed
in one case to rip shirt cuff off arm when having difficulty
undoing a button.
HEENT- NC/AT. EOMI. Anicteric sclera. Moist mucous membranes.
NECK: JVP at 2 cm above sternal notch
Cardiac- RRR nl S1 S2. No m,r,g.
Pulm- Decreased bibasilar breath sounds with faint wheezes at R
base. No rales or rhonchi.
Abdomen- Soft but visibly distended. Mildly tender to palpation
in epigastric region while not complaining of significant pain.
No rebound tenderness or guarding. Positive bowel sounds.
Extremities- Warm. No c/c/e.

Brief Hospital Course:
59 year old man with PMH significant for CAD s/p CABG and
stents; atrial fibrillation; ETOH abuse; and recurrent
pancreatitis admitted with active severe pancreatitis.
.
## GI
.
#. Pancreatitis: Due to EtOH. Amylase and lipase steadily
improved since admission to nearly normal levels.  No
complication seen on abdominal CT. He initially had prerenal
azotemia and was bolused, urine output fully recovered by day of
discharge.
- Able to tolerate PO clears by day prior to discharge, no
epigastric pain reported on discharge on [**11-12**], able to ambulate
well.
- dilaudid PCA initially, d/c'ed on [**11-11**].
- Had some minor non-bloody diarrhea night before discharge
perhaps s/p stool softeners and laxatives; K repleted and bowel
regimen d/c'ed.

## Pulmonary
.
# Low Grade Fever:
- Initial suspicion of ? aspiration pneumonia based on CXR w/
RUL infiltrates but CXR gradually resolved over course of stay.

- Continued w/ some low grades temps and fever until day prior
to admission when temp fully normalized.

# Pulmonary edema:
- Found to be volume overloaded on exam and by CXR early in
stay, perhaps s/p aggressive initial rehydration in wake of
prerenal azotemia on admission.
- TTE showed normal EF and no sign of diastolic dysfunction but
sub-optimal windows.
- Excellent urine output by day before discharge w/o need for
diuresis.
.
# Wheezes on Lung Exam:
- No prior hx of such wheezes. No h/o COPD. Improved with
albuterol nebs.
- Could be due to volume overload, but could also be from
metoprolol.
- Received nebs prn.
- Consider pulmonary function tests as an outpatient
.
##Neuro/psych/tox
.
# EtOH abuse- Mr. [**Known lastname 51051**] has a history of ETOH withdrawal per
records and required prolonged intubation for this at an OSH. He
has a reported history of allergy to ativan, but this actually
seems to have been a result of oversedation from too much ativan
administered.
- He was maintained on a diazepam CIWA scale for ETOH withdrawal
throughout hospitalization. Given hypertension and tachycardia
on admission, treated with diazepam 10iv x 1 and monitored
throughout.
- On [**11-11**] he had a ? withdrawal picture pulling out IV and
becoming somewhat agitated in late afternoon, mildly
diaphoretic.
- On morning of [**11-12**] he vigorously expressed desire to leave
hospital, became somewhat agitated.  However, though
hypertensive in both cases of agitation, he had no tachycardia.
Seemed frustrated with situation but aware and no indication of
MS changes or confusion.  No indication of DT.
- Placed on fall precautions.
- Given thiamine and folate qd
