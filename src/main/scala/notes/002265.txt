Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4358**]
Chief Complaint:
cold like symptoms


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
endotracheal intubation
Right internal jugular vein central vein catheter placement
arterial line placement
bronchoscopy

History of Present Illness:
25 yo F with no significant PMH presented to OSH with cold-like
symptoms which progressively worsened to multilobar pneumonia
per report, transferred here for persistent hypoxia requiring
NRB and blood tinged sputum ? need for bronchoscopy.
.
Per report, patient was seen in [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] x 2 over this week
with cold like symptoms.  Her symptom started on [**9-2**] with body
ache, headache, and mild nasal congestion/rhinorrhea, so she
went to the ED on [**9-3**].  She was discharged with ibuprofen.
Then developed fever up to 102-103 with dry cough, dizziness,
lightheadedness with changing positions.  She was noted to be
hypotensive in the ED again on [**9-5**], got IVF, and got admitted.
 Since her admission to [**Hospital1 **] medicine floor, she has received
CTX and azithromycin for atypical pneumonia/multilobar
pneumonia.  She reports that her ache and HA are gone,
temperature is better, but breathing and cough have worsened
since [**9-5**].  She reports that her sputum is not thick but is
tinged with blood, pink in color.  She has a mild sore throat
now.  She desatted down to 78-80% on 6L, for which rapid
response was called.  Her O2 requirement has gone up over the
last 24 hours, requiring NRB from 2L initially.  Given her
leukopenia, persistent fever with Tm 105.3 ([**9-5**]), worsening
hypoxia, patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further
management.
.
Of note, patient reports + sick contact in school where multiple
kids have called in sick.  No sick contact at home.  She lives
in a dorm.  Traveled recently to [**Country 14635**] in [**2-/2125**], [**Location (un) **] [**11/2124**],
[**Location (un) 7349**], [**Location (un) 5354**] over the last couple of years.  No known TB
exposure.
.
Currently, patient reports feeling somewhat difficult with
breathing, coughing frequently, mild sore throat.

Echo:
The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thickness,
cavity size and regional/global systolic function are normal
(LVEF >55%). There is no ventricular septal defect. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good
leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic
regurgitation. There is no aortic valve stenosis. The mitral
valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral
regurgitation. There is no mitral valve prolapse. The pulmonary
artery systolic pressure could not be determined. There is no
pericardial effusion.

RUQ ultrasound:
FINDINGS: The liver is normal in appearance with no focal liver
lesion. No biliary dilatation is seen and the common duct
measures 0.3 cm. The portal vein is patent with hepatopetal
flow. There is some sludge seen within the lumen of the
gallbladder; however, no gallstones are identified. The pancreas
is unremarkable but is only partially visualized. The spleen is
unremarkable measuring 11.5 cm. A small splenule measuring 1.9
cm is seen at the inferior tip of the spleen. No hydronephrosis
is seen. The right kidney measures 10.4 cm and the left kidney
measures 11.2 cm. The visualized portion of the IVC is
unremarkable. No AAA is identified. No ascites is seen in the
abdomen. There are right and left pleural effusions.
.
IMPRESSION:
1. Unremarkable son[**Name (NI) 493**] appearance of the abdomen.

FINDINGS: The tip of the endotracheal tube is 3.9 cm from the
carina. A
nasogastric tube courses through the esophagus and entering into
the expected location of the stomach but the tip is beyond the
field of view. Bilateral hazy lung opacities are present with
prominence of the pulmonary vasculature bilaterally. Bibasilar
consolidations are present. Bilateral layering pleural effusions
are present. No pneumothorax is present.
.
IMPRESSION:

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms [**Known firstname 91468**] is a 25 year old female with no significant PMH who
presented with multilobar pneumonia with hypoxia and increased
O2 requirement requiring intubation for respiratory failure.

# RESPIRATORY FAILURE:
Patient was admitted to MICU from the outside hospital. During
her initial hours, she became profoundly hypoxemic requiring
intubation. Clinical picture was consistent with ARDS thought
