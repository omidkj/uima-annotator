HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 52-year-old
male admitted to an outside hospital on [**4-7**] for a four-day
history of dyspnea.  The patient was found to be in pulmonary
edema, and further review of systems indicated that the
patient had nausea and vomiting  four days prior to the
outside hospital admission.  The patient also had the
sensation of abdominal discomfort at that time.

Although no labs were available from the outside hospital,
the patient reportedly had a flat CK but positive troponin,
suggesting nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain were symptoms
of acute myocardial infarction.  At that time, the patient
was treated with intravenous Lasix, heparin drip, Aspirin,
ACE inhibitor, Metoprolol, Plavix, and Zocor.

His dyspnea improved, but a TTE at the outside hospital
showed an ejection fraction of 50 percent with severe
inferior-posterior lateral akinesis/hypokinesis.  Earlier
this morning, the patient had epigastric discomfort, similar
to that which he experienced recently and was transferred to
[**Hospital6 256**] for cardiac
catheterization.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Type 2 diabetes.  2.  Hypercholesterolemia.  3.
   Hypertension.  4.  Bipolar disorder.  5.  Recent dental
   infection.


MEDICATIONS ON TRANSFER:  Lopressor 12.5 b.i.d., Lisinopril
2.5 q.d., Plavix 75 q.d., Zocor 80 q.d., Lasix 40 p.o. q.d.,
Aspirin 325 q.d., Protonix 40 q.d., Depakote 2500 q.a.m.,
Lamotrigine 1000 mg p.o. b.i.d., Gabapentin 300 h.s., Augment
500 t.i.d., Duragesic 15 mg transdermal q.72 hours, regular
Insulin sliding scale.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  He smokes [**11-28**] 1/2 packs per day.  He quit
alcohol four years ago.  He has a remote cocaine history.
His father passed at age 65 secondary to myocardial
infarction and cerebrovascular accident.  His mother is alive
at 85.

The patient was brought to the Cardiac Catheterization
Laboratory.  Cath showed a mildly diseased left main,  mild
diffuse disease in the left anterior descending coronary
artery, and a totally occluded proximal left circumflex with
right-to-left and left-to-left collaterals to the first
obtuse marginal.  The patient subsequently had a left
circumflex stent placed.  He was also noted to have normal
cardiac input and cardiac index.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs:  Temperature 100, blood
pressure 137/80, heart rate 97, respirations 14.  General:
He was a disheveled-appearing male in no acute distress.  He
had poor dentition with no purulence drainage in his mouth.
HEENT:  His JVP was 9 cm.  Lungs:  He had crackles one-half
of the way up bilaterally.  Heart:  Regular rate and rhythm.
No murmurs, rubs, or gallops.  Extremities:  He had 2+ pulses
throughout and had no peripheral edema.

Electrocardiogram at the catheterization laboratory showed
normal sinus at 95, right atrial abnormality, normal axis, T-
wave inversions in I, II and AVF, V4-V6, as well as 1-2 mm ST
segment depressions in V2-V4.

An echocardiogram on [**2166-4-8**], showed an ejection
fraction of 30 percent with severe hypokinesis and akinesis
of the inferior wall, severe hypokinesis of the
posterolateral wall, [**11-29**]+ mitral regurgitation, 2+ tricuspid
regurgitation, and mild pulmonary hypertension.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. Coronary artery disease:  The patient was continued on
   Aspirin, Plavix, and Integrelin for 18 hours.  He was also
   continued on Lipitor 80 mg p.o. q.d.  His cardiac
   medications were subsequently titrated.  Eventually his
   medications were titrated up, and he was switched to
   Lisinopril 5 mg p.o. q.d., Lopressor 37 mg p.o. b.i.d.,
   and was given Lasix p.r.n. for edema.

During the rest of his hospitalization, his coronary artery
disease issues remained stable.

2. Infectious disease:  The patient spiked a fever on [**2166-4-14**] to over 102 degrees.  As noted, the patient had a history
   of a recent dental infection and had been started on Augmentin
   500 mg t.i.d. by the outside hospital.  Blood and urine
   cultures were subsequently sent and were unrevealing.

The Cardiac Care Unit Team empirically added Clindamycin for
better anaerobic coverage.  The Coronary Care Unit Team
requested an inpatient dental consult.  The Dental
consult felt that he did not have a dental abscess, and
Panorex films that obtained were unrevealing.

An Oromaxofacial Surgery consult was also obtained, and they
felt that while the patient had chronic dental issues, they
did not believe that his teeth were the cause of fevers (and
they represented chronic infection).

Subsequent work-up of the fevers included placement of a PPD
which was negative.  The patient also reported a mild cough
and a [**12-31**] week history of chronic night sweats.  A chest x-
ray was obtained which showed a very large left-sided pleural
effusion.  This was eventually tapped and was exudative in
nature.

The patient three induced sputums  which did not
grow any acid-fast bacilli.  Furthermore, as mentioned
previously, he had several series of blood and urine cultures
which were all pending to date.  Studies from the pleural
fluid showed no organismss.  There were no AFB on
direct smear from the fluid, and fluid cultures were also
negative.

The patient subsequently returned for an addition
thoracentesis, as a CAT scan of the chest (after the initial
thoracentesis) showed that the remaining fluid had become
loculated.  An addition 900 cc of fluid was drained.  A chest CT
was obtained to evaluate for possible malignancy or granulomatous
disease suggestive of tuberculosis.

 CT of the chest showed a small right-sided pleural
effusion, a tiny patchy opacity within the right lower lobe,
and a loculated left-sided pleural effusion which was lying
the major fissure.  There were also patchy ground glass
opacities in the left lung.  There was a tiny nodule in the
left lower lobe.  There were also noted to be mild
cardiomegaly.  There was also a small pericardial effusion,
as well as nonpathologically enlarged mediastinal and
axillary nodes.  There was no significant axillary
mediastinal hilar adenopathy.

To complete his Infectious Disease work-up, a sinus CT was
also obtained, as the patient had also been complaining of
some sinus pain.  This showed minimal mucosal thickening in
the right maxillary sinus.  The remainder of this study was
unremarkable.

3. Endocrine:  The patient was continued on sliding scale
   Insulin, as well as his outpatient dose of Glyburide.

4. Psychiatric:  He was continued on all of his outpatient
   psychiatric medications.  Also Celexa was added 20 mg p.o.
   q.d.

Because the patient's acute coronary issues had been
intervened upon, the patient was transferred to the Medicine
Team for resolution of the patient's infectious disease
issues, as well as the issues regarding his pleural effusion.

This dictation covers the [**Hospital 228**] hospital course from [**2166-4-11**], through [**2166-4-17**].  The remainder of the
[**Hospital 228**] hospital course will be dictated by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]
