History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 73 year-old man with a 4.5 x 4.5 cm mod-poorly
differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of the RUL with possible
N1 nodal met based on FDG avidity on PET scan and negative N2
nodes by mediastinoscopy ([**2199-7-10**]). Distant metastatic work up
has been negative. Due to presence of enlarged hilar lymph node,
open right upper lobectomy was recommended. Patient's
cardiologist was consulted for recommendations regarding newly
diagnosed atrial fibrillation.

Past Medical History:

years.

Pertinent Results:
CXR:
[**2199-8-22**]: The tracheostomy is in place. The tip is approximately
6 cm above the carina. The right PICC line tip is at the level
of low SVC. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged. There is
no change in the right basal consolidation, left basal
consolidation and fluid collection in the right upper
hemithorax.  All those findings are unchanged compared to prior
study with no new abnormalities that potentially may explain the
inability to wean from ventilation

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was admitted on [**2199-7-26**] for Right thoracotomy via
Right upper lobectomy.
with Mediastinal lymph node dissection.  He was extubated in the
operating room monitored in the PACU prior transfer to the
floor.  On [**2199-7-27**] he was noted to have increased "facial
edema" and subjective respiratory distress. Exam showed
increased subcutaneous emphysema tracking on the right tracking
to his face. Both chest tubes were to water seal with a large
leak. He was transferred to the TICU.  The chest tube were
placed to suction, with improvement in his respiratory status.
On [**7-28**] he developed respiratory distress with oxygen
saturations in the low 80's on face mask.  He was placed on a
non-re breather. Taken back to OR to evaluate for bronchial
leak/repair parenchyma leak.  He underwent Redo thoracotomy.
Creation of pleural tent. Application of tissue sealant to lung
parenchyma and Therapeutic bronchoscopy.  On [**2199-7-30**] he was
extubated, developed subcutaneous emphysema requiring
re-intubation.  On [**2199-8-1**] he had Flexible bronchoscopy which
showed continuous bronchopleural fistula that only improves with
complete occlusion of the right lower lobe.  He continued to
have respiratory distress with a large amount of secretions.  On
[**2199-8-3**] he underwent Flexible bronchoscopy, therapeutic
aspiration of secretions. Bronchoscopic guidance for
percutaneous tracheostomy tube placement(#8 Portex
nonfenestrated). On [**2199-8-4**] flexible bronchoscopy with clot
removal from left bronchus.

Respiratory: He tolerated Trach mask trial during the day with
CPAP [**4-6**] 60% overnight. Oxygen saturations 93-99%. Desaturates
with disconnection of T-tube. Thick blood tinged secretions
diminished with aggressive pulmonary toilet, nebs and chest PT.

Chest tubes: 2 chest tubes placed within the pleural tent to
suction for persistent air leak. they were placed to water-seal.
 On [**2199-8-5**] one chest was clamped for six hrs.  Follow-up chest
x-ray showed no pneumothorax subsequently the chest tube was
removed.  The remainder chest was removed on [**2199-8-7**].

Cardiac: atrial fibrillation with rate of 70-130's. Diltiazem
drip was started and converted to PO once able to tolerate with
good rate control 60-80's.  Blood pressure 100-130's.
Anticoagulation with Aspirin 325 mg.

GI: PPI & bowel regime

Nutrition: Tube feeds Novasource Renal with 35 g beneprotein
Goal 45 mL/hr via NGT.  Seen by nutrition whom recommended Boost
Control @ 85 ml/hr which he tolerated and converted to PO
without difficulty.

Speech: he was seen by speech for PMV and swallow evaluation.
He was cleared for PO diet: nectar-thick liquids and pureed
solids, Medications crushed with puree which he tolerated.  The
PMV he was unable to tolerate for any length of time.  He is
able to phonate around the #8 Portex non-fenestrated trach.

Renal: developed ATN peak CRE 2.8 base 1.2 secondary to
hypotension and low urine output.  Renal was consulted who
recommended increasing free water, prevent hypotension and
monitor renal function closely.  Renal US on [**2199-8-15**] showed no
renal stenosis or hydronephrosis. His foley was removed [**2199-8-22**]
and he voided without difficulty.

Endocrine:  DMT2 BS mid 200's initially on insulin drip
converted to NPH.  [**Last Name (un) **] was consulted and recommended changing
to Lantus [**Hospital1 **] with sliding scale adjusted as needed.  His blood
sugars improved over the course of his hospitalization.

Heme: Over the course of his hospitalization he was transfused x
3 for a HCT < 30.

Neuro: while in TSICU, intubated/sedated he develop delirium.
Geriatrics was con
