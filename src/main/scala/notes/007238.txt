has a history of coronary artery disease.  He is status post
CABG times two with left [**Female First Name (un) 899**] in [**2147**] and status post PTCA and
stenting to the left circumflex.  He has had several weeks of
chest pain at rest which is relieved promptly with sublingual
nitroglycerin.  He had a Persantine exercise tolerance test
on [**2165-10-11**] without symptoms or EKG changes which showed an
LVEF of 30-35%, moderate to severe ischemic dilatation,
severe partially reversible inferior wall defect, and mild
reversible inferolateral defect and akinesis of the septum.

He underwent a cardiac catheterization at [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2165-10-18**]
which revealed that the LV had 1+ MR and a LVEF of 35%.  The
LAD had an ostial 90% lesion.  The left circumflex was a
codominant vessel with mild paroxysmal disease from 60% left
main lesion.  The left main had a diffuse 60% lesion with
moderate calcifications.  The RCA was a codominant vessel
which was 100% occluded proximally.  The saphenous vein graft
to the RCA was proximally occluded.  The LIMA to the LAD was
patent without critical lesions.  His left subclavian artery
had an ostial 80% lesion.  His right subclavian artery had a
90% lesion at the origin.  He had a stent of his left
subclavian on that same day.

He was now admitted for redo CABG.  He had an echocardiogram
in [**9-11**] which revealed an EF of 50%, 2+ MR and trivial TR.
