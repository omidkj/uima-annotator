Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Taxol

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4057**]
Chief Complaint:
Reason for admission to ICU: Hypotension

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
44yo M w/ widely metastatic lung cancer released [**2198-9-14**] from
the federal prison hospital in [**Doctor First Name 5256**] on compassionate
care, then flew to [**Location (un) 86**] for transfer to [**Hospital1 18**] where he had
syncope at [**Location (un) 6692**] airport. Of note, hx limited by by pt's
discomfortable/SOB while talking as well as no records from
prison hospital.  Pt has been in prison hospital since [**Month (only) 956**],
when he was diagnosed with metastatic lung CA. Pt reports that
the cancer is an adenocarcinoma. Pt knows of abdominal, adrenal
& [**Last Name (un) 2043**] mets only. His treatment has included chemo & radiation.
Pt has received ? mult chemotherapies, though only recalled
Taxol, which he states he had an allergic reaction to--causing
flushing & discomfort. Pt has received XRT to chest & abdomen.
Last radiation tx was a few days ago.
.
His current issues include:
- Pain involving chest wall, abdomen, and back. Chest pain is
generalized discomfort, non-radiating, not associated w/
palpitations or activity. Abdominal pain diffuse, no change in
bowel or bladder habits. Occasional N/V. No blood noted in
emesis/stool. Of note, these issues have been stably present for
months.
- Hypoglycemia, which has been present for an unknown period,
but has been treated with a D5W drip at OSH hospital. Pt arrived
to the ED on D5W drip and may have been getting it during his
flight to [**Location (un) 86**]. No h/o diabetes.
- Lower extremity DVTs & LUE DVT for which pt has been on
lovenox [**Hospital1 **] (per his report). He states that he was soon to
complete tx.
- Shortness of breath w/ talking or activity associated with dry
cough.
- Fatigue/generalized weakness/weight loss, which have rapidly
progressed since patient's diagnosis with CA in [**Month (only) 956**]. Pt
reports having lost >50lbs?. Does have an appetite. Has not been
out of bed much.
.
In the [**Name (NI) **], pt was afebrile HR 80s & SBP 90s (pt believes his SBP
has been in the 90s for a few months). An initial FS was 70; pt
was given D5 & glucose improved to 135. He was given vanc, levo,
flagyl for possible infection. He had a head CT which showed
vasogenic edema, possibly from a met. CXR showed apical bullous
disease & small b/l pleural effusions.
.
Upon inital admission to the floor, pt noted to be tachypneic w/
RR up to 26 while talking. SBP dropped into 70s from 80s-90s. 02
sats 98% RA. Pt mentating clearly. Given 1L NS & SBP increased
the 90s. FSBS 71 while on D5 1/2NS at 150cc/hr, then given 1 amp
of D50 with improvement of glucose to 146.
.
He was then transferred to the MICU the morning after initial
admission ([**9-15**]) for persistent hypotension & tachypnea as well
as closer monitoring of his FSBS given reported hypoglycemia.
.
On arrival to the MICU, pt reported feeling "ok." He has stable
chest wall, abdominal, and back pain. No HA/vision changes. +
SOB with exertion or speech. He denies lightheadedness, visual
changes, chest pain, vomiting and diarrhea.
.
Was treated with IVF, and tx'd to OMED service, on arrival to
floor on OMED, was transiently hypotensive to 76, and triggered
althought asymptomatic, transferred to ICU where BP was 86, but
also noted to be hypoglycemic to 47


Past Medical History:
1) Metastatic Lung CA - adenocarcinoma per pt
- Patient has been treated at [**Hospital 100109**] Medical Facility, NC while
in Prison. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 6483**] radiation oncologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] medical
oncologist. Possible adrenal/abdominal mets. History of XRT to
chest/abd, ? adrenals. [**Month (only) 116**] have some tracheal compression due to
CA. No history of intracranial mets as per patient.
2) DVTs - patient has had DVTs in both legs & left arm. Has been
getting lovenox.

Social History:
Patient recently released from federal prison, returning home to
[**Location (un) 86**] to be closer to his family. His mother, [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) 100110**], &

Pertinent Results:
Radiology:
CXR [**2198-9-14**]
A right-sided Port-A-Catheter is identified in the upper SVC.
There is right apical hyperlucency, most likely representing
apical bullous disease. The patient is extremely rotated on this
exam. There are bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than
right, which are unchanged. There is bibasilar atelectasis. The
mediastinal contour is grossly unremarkable. There are no focal
consolidations. IMPRESSION: Right apical lucency likely
secondary to bullous disease. Unchanged appearance of
atelectasis and pleural effusions as described above.
.
CT Head [**2198-9-14**]
There is no intra-axial or extra-axial hemorrhage. There is a
small focus of hypodensity in the right posterior lobe near the
high convexity which may represent a focus of vasogenic edema.
No definite underlying lesion is seen, though evaluation for
metastatic disease is limited on this non-contrast study. No
additional areas of similar hypodensity are seen to suggest
additional lesions in the brain. There is no hydrocephalus or
shift of normally midline structures. The paranasal sinuses,
mastoid air cells, and middle ear cavities are clear. The
calvarium is intact, without evidence of suspicious lytic or
blastic lesion.
IMPRESSION: Focus of suspected vasogenic edema in the right
posterior frontal lobe near the high convexity, concerning for
metastatic disease from patient's known lung cancer. Further
evaluation with MRI is recommended. No acute intracranial
hemorrhage.
.
BILAT LOWER EXT VEINS Study Date of [**2198-9-15**]
1.  Acute occlusive DVT involving the left common femoral vein,
greater saphenous vein, and superficial femoral vein.
2.  Occlusive thrombus, likely subacute/chronic, involving the
right greater saphenous and superficial femoral veins.
Non-occlusive thrombus within the right common femoral vein.
.
UNILAT UP EXT VEINS US  Study Date of [**2198-9-15**] 8:53 AM
Non-visualization of the left internal jugular vein, presumably
thrombosed, as well as thrombosis of the left subclavian vein.
The left brachial vein is patent as well as the right subclavian
vein.
.
MR HEAD W & W/O CONTRAS Study Date of [**2198-9-15**] 9:45 AM
1.  Significantly limited study due to patient motion and lack
of post-gadolinium T1-weighted images.
2.  T2 hyperintensity of the right frontal lobe involving the
right motor cortex surrounding a smaller area of even more T2
hyperintensity, which may show some enhancement.  These findings
are suspicious for metastasis.
.
IVC GRAM/FILTER Study Date of [**2198-9-15**] 6:36 PM
Uncomplicated IVC filter placement from the right internal
jugular venous approach.
.
CT CHEST W/CONTRAST Study Date of [**2198-9-16**] 1:25 PM
1.  Extensive metastatic disease.
2.  Bilateral pulmonary emboli.
3.  Bilateral pleural effusions, left > right, with bibasilar
opacities likely representing atelectasis.
4.  Partially occlusive thrombus within the superior vena cava.
5.  No definite pericardial involvement with tumor.
6.  Extensive vertebral destruction primarily T3 and T4
vertebral bodies by in
