Allergies:
Amoxicillin / Nortriptyline

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2763**]
Chief Complaint:
hypoxia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
intubation

History of Present Illness:
 This is a 64yo female h/o CHF (EF 55%), COPD, obesity
hypoventilation, OSA with CPAP (almost no compliance) who was
brought in by EMS today from ALF with hypoxia and AMS.
According to EMS and a note in the computer, patient has been
having chest pain that radiates to her jaw at times although
patient denies this at this time.  Pt was recently admitted here
in [**Month (only) 547**] with a similar presentation.  Of note, pt has been
noted to desaturate to mid-80s on prior admissions. Also, she
continues to smoke 1 ppd; she is not allowed to use home oxygen.

.
In the ED, initial VS were 96.8 70 120/63 22 100%. Patient has
no complaints and cannot offer further history. Pt denied chest
pain, denies taking too much of her tramadol. She does not want
to use a nasal cannula or the non-rebreather and refuses [**Month (only) **]
testing. During her recent admission for similar presentation,
she was thought to be in CHF exacerbation and her mental status
was thought to be due to potential hypercarbia in the setting of
not using her BiPAP at night for sleep apnea.  On exam here, she
was noted to have crackles at bases, answered all questions,
sleepy but oriented.  She was hypoxic to low 80s without NC, but
recovers to high 80s-low 90s with 4L NC.  Labs only remarkable
for WBC 13.  UA is pending, normal lactate.  CXR showed pulm
edema c/w CHF.  EKG with no change from baseline.  Pt was given
IV Lasix 20mg to which she urinated 1100cc. Also given Levaquin
for potential pneumonia given elevated white blood cell count
and inability to view infiltrate in the setting of edema on
chest x-ray.
Pt was then admitted to ICU because patient has hypoxia and will
not keep her NC on so will need constant reminder and nursing.
Vitals prior to transfer: Temp 97.6, Pulse 87, RR 20, BP 116/85,
O2 Sat 86-92 on O2 Flow 4L.
.
On arrival to the MICU, pt is sitting in bed, appears agitated.
Denies chest pain.  Complains of cold/cough for last 1 week.
Admits to fever to 100 at home.  Denies abd pain, diarrhea,
dysuria.

blood culture pending
.
CXR: (admission)
SINGLE PORTABLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST:  Lung volumes are low
resulting in vascular crowding.  However, despite this, there is
evidence of mild to moderate pulmonary vascular congestion.
Cardiac silhouette is enlarged despite the portable technique.
Probable small bilateral pleural effusions.
No focal consolidation is seen to suggest pneumonia.  No
pneumothorax is
evident although the lung apices are obscured by overlying soft
tissue.
IMPRESSION:  Mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema.

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 64yo female h/o dCHF (EF 55%), COPD, obesity
hypoventilation, OSA with CPAP (almost no compliance) now here
with chest pain that has resolved on arrival here as well as
hypoxia.

# Respiratory failure: likely multifactorial, including COPD
exacerbation (tight on exam) potential pneumonia contributing
(fever and cough, though CXR not entirely convincing), dCHF with
volume overload (pulm edema on CXR). This overlies chronic
issues of obesity hypoventilation syndrome and OSA (noncompliant
with CPAP). Patient with negative troponin x3 ruling out ACS.
Patient was intubated overnight [**5-7**] for increased work of
breathing, then successfully extubated [**5-8**]. She was continued
on duonebs q6 hrs and albuterol q2 hours prn. She was initially
treated with IV solumedrol which was subsequently transitioned
to po prednisone. She was also initially started on antibiotics
for HCAP given fever, respiratory distress, and leukocytosis.
However, given clinical improvement and lack of consolidation on
CXR, antibiotics were changed to levofloxacin for COPD
exacerbation.
She was transferred to the floor early in the morning on [**5-12**],
but returned later in the morning due to hypoxemia [**1-15**] to
nonadherence to oxygen by NC and somnolence with pCO2 ranging
from 72-78 torr.
.
The patient was sent back to the ICU due to this hypoxia where
she was stabilized again on a nasal cannula, and over the course
of 2 additional days she had significant improvement in her
mental status, ambulatory status, and most importantly,
improvement in her respiratory status, maintaining o2
saturations in the low 90s.  She does have dyspnea on exertion,
but this is baseline for the patient.
.
# UTI ?????? urine culture shows >100K MDR E. Coli. Patient was
started on treatment with meropenem. However, repeat UA and
urine culture showed no infection, so the meropenem was stopped
[**5-11**].
.
# Agitation: Initial presentation consistent with delirium in
the setting of infection, hypoxia.  Also, pt has h/o agitation
and noncompliance at baseline. While in the MICU patient was
intermittently put in wrist restraints and treated with IV
haldol for her agitation.
.
# dCHF: Initially held beta blocker and ACE given SBPs in low
100s with propofol. Her ACEi and beta blocker were gradually
added back as pressures stabilized.

# CAD/HTN: Initially held ACE, beta blocker, spironolactone,
isosorbide. Her plavix was continued. She was gradually
restarted on her home medications.
.
# Depression: continued home aripiprazole, fluoxetine
.
# DMII: on metformin at home. Blood sugars were controlled with
insulin sliding scale while in house.
.
# Chest pain: resolved on arrival to ED. EKG similar to
baseline. Trop negative x 3.
