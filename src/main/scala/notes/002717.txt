[**2146-7-26**] CXR:Comparison demonstrates that the multiple linear
atelectasis and local right- sided pleural thickening is related
to the most recent mitral valve replacement. A linear left lower
lobe posterior segment atelectasis that is present now was not
found on the preoperative examination. There is, however, no
evidence of any significant CHF, nor are there any new
parenchymal infiltrates identified.


Brief Hospital Course:
Pre-operative:
CHF: symptoms may be worsening, perhaps [**1-20**] Mitral failing
valve. LV systolic diameter abnormal, necessitating valve
replacement before permanent damage ensues.  She was continued
on her lasix/ACEI and remained clinically euvolemic.  Valve
replacement as below.
MV: Cardiac surgery was consulted for consideration of
replacement of the mitral valve.  She underwent pre-operative
workup, including UA, CXR, CT of the head, and carotid US.  All
were normal.  CT of the head showed evidence of old stroke.  She
was taken for surgery on [**2146-7-19**].
PVD: Vascular surgery was consulted for input on her Left lower
extremity non-healing ulcer.  They felt that it was not infected
and recommended continued wet to dry dressing changes.  It was
not felt that this would be a contraindication to surgery.
IVDU: Methadone and percocet were continued in-house as per her
outpatient regimen.
CVA: she sustained a stroke during aortic valve surgery and has
been on tegretol since that time for seizure prophylaxis.  This
was continued in-house.
Disposition: She was taken for Mitral valve replacement on
[**2146-7-19**] and transferred to the cardiac surgery service at this
time.

Taken to the operating room on [**2146-7-19**], for a mitral valve
replacement ([**Street Address(2) 11599**]. [**Male First Name (un) 923**] mechanical) via right thoracotomy
with rib removal.  Post-op, she was transferred to the cardiac
surgery recovery unit in stable condition, on Epinephrine and
neosynephrine gtts.  Sedation and vasopressors were weaned off,
but she was slow to wake.  On POD # 2, the neurology service was
consulted due to continued decreased responsiveness.  EEG at
that time did show some seizure activity, and tegretol was
subsequently increased.  MRI showed multiple [**Last Name (un) **] appearing
infarcts, with no acute lesions.  She began to awaken over the
next few days, had remained hemodynamically stable, and was
ultimately transferred to the post-op telemetry floor on POD #
5.  Anticoagulation was started with heparin, and transitioned
to Coumadin as her INR increased.
A wound care consult was obtained for her foot ulcer, and
Silvadene dressings were recommended.  Physical  therapy was
begun, but the patient is slow to progress with ambulation and
stability.  Her Methadone dose had been decreased during her
post-operative course (from her pre-op dose of 30 mg daily) to
10 mg daily due to her decreased mental status and overall
sedation.  She has remained hemodynamically stable, and is ready
for discharge to rehab for physical therapy and progression to
independent ambulation.
