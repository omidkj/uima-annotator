Service: NEUROLOGY

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2569**]
Chief Complaint:
mumbling speech, disorientation

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Nasogastric tube placement


History of Present Illness:
87yo female with PMH significant for HTN presented with mumbling
speech, left facial droop, and agitation. She had worsening in
her hypertension over 2weeks (SBP 240s) requiring an increase in
her HTN meds (lisinopril to 20mg QD). After her visit to her
internist for HTN on [**2115-8-14**], she had an episode of slurred
speech (muffling) which improved over the night. In the
afternoon on [**8-17**], her daughter noticed again her slowed and
muffled speech. She also became "weak", such that she could not
stand up, and had a left facial droop around 430pm. She was
brought to [**Hospital3 **] ED, where head CT was reported to be
normal. For further management, she was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]. On
arrival in the ED, her BP was 265/97 and HR 67. A nitro drip was
initiated with resulting SBP falling to the 190s. In the ED, she
also received ativan for agitation.

ROS was negative for fever, vomiting, palpitations, nausea,
chest pain, SOB, abdominal pain, or recent trauma or falls.

Imaging:
HCT [**2115-8-17**]: 1. Limited exam, but no definite acute intracranial
hemorrhage is visualized.
2. Evidence of chronic microvascular ischemia.
3. Increased distance between the anterior arch of C1 and the
odontoid process, measuring up to 5 mm.

HCT [**2115-8-25**]:
Chest CT: Spiculated mass in the right lower lobe, measuring
approximately 5 cm, without an associated pleural effusion. No
adjacent lymphadenopathy is seen in the mediastinum. Findings
are most concerning for a primary neoplasm. Additional small
scattered pulmonary lesions are indeterminate.

CT c-spine: 1. Widening of the atlantoaxial distance with at
least moderate spinal canal narrowing at this level. These
findings could be due to ligamentous laxity such as could occur
with rheumatoid arthritis. Please correlate with the [**Hospital 228**]
medical history.
2. There is calcification of portions of the transverse
ligament.

Repeat HCT [**2115-8-19**]: No evidence for acute intracranial hemorrhage
or mass effect. Chronic periventricular changes as noted on the
patient's prior brain MRI.

EEG: BACKGROUND: Included a well-formed [**9-25**] Hz alpha frequency
in
posterior areas bilaterally during wakefulness. Much of the
background
was obscured by movement artifact.
HYPERVENTILATION: Could not be performed.
INTERMITTENT PHOTIC STIMULATION: Could not be performed.
SLEEP: The patient appeared to remain awake throughout the
recording.
CARDIAC MONITOR: Showed a generally regular rhythm.
IMPRESSION: Largely normal EEG in wakefulness. Large portions of
the
recording were obscured by movement artifact. Nevertheless,
there were no areas of prominent focal slowing. No epileptiform
features were seen.

CXR [**2115-8-18**]: Pneumonia or aspiration of the right basilar chest.
A lateral view will be helpful in placing the consolidation in
the right middle or lower lobe.

Repeat CXR [**2115-8-25**]: There has been interval removal of the
feeding tube. On today's study, the opacity in the right lower
lobe has a more mass-like appearance and measures 3.5 cm and is
worrisome for malignancy. This would be better assessed with CT
scan. Otherwise, the lungs are clear. There is residual contrast
seen throughout the colon with multiple diverticula.

MRI:  No evidence of an acute infarct. Chronic microvascular
ischemic changes. Increased atlanto-axial distance. It should be
correlated with the patient's history. Does the patient have a
history of rheumatoid arthritis. Correlation with the cervical
spine CT could be obtained if further evaluation is needed.

MRA brain: 2-mm aneurysm at the cavernous portion of the left
internal carotid artery. O/w nl.

MRA neck: Narrowing at the right internal carotid artery origin


Brief Hospital Course:
87yo woman with PMH significant for HTN, EtOH abuse, likely
dementia, presented with left facial droop, possible left
hemiplegia, slurred speech, and disorientation. The etiology of
this is likely secondary to hypertensive encephalopathy though
infection (pneumonia), metabolic derangement may be
contributory. Stroke and seizure is unlikely given MRI and EEG
findings.

Hospital course is reviewed below by problem:

1. Encephalopathy: MRI did not show any areas of restricted
diffusion on DWI, but did show extensive periventricular white
matter disease seen on FLAIR. EEG had no epileptiform activity.
Blood pressure was initially controlled by nipride gtt, with
goal SBP<140, however at first she seemed to get worse
(somnolent, dysarthria, disorientation) when her BP was lowered
to 160. The initial goal was thus SBP between 170 and 185. Once
she was stabilized on that level, her BP goal was lowered. Her
BP was eventually controlled with SBP<150. She was started on
ASA 325mg daily. HbA1C was 5.1. Lipid panel was slightly
elevated so lipitor 20mg daily was started. She ruled out for an
MI. CXR showed RLL infiltrate (see below), so she was started on
levofloxacin. Physical therapy and occupational therapy worked
with her during her hospitalization. She was oriented, no longer
dysarthric, with full strength but residual left facial droop
and mild left pronator drift on discharge.

2. RLL infiltrate: She was found to have a RLL infiltrate on
initial CXR and was started on levofloxacin on [**8-18**] (as well as
ceftriaxone and flagyl x 1 in the ED). She remained afebrile
until [**8-24**], when she had an isolated temperature to 101. She had
a repeat CXR which was concerning for a mass. Chest CT confirmed
the presence of a spiculated mass in the RLL. Pulmonary service
was consulted. They recommended a CT-guided trans
