Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 64**]
Chief Complaint:
L knee pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2131-1-11**] Left total knee arthroplasty


History of Present Illness:
I met with [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Known lastname **] today.  He earlier in the day had met with
Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) 7376**] to consider whether or not any additional
procedures can and should be done to his left knee, which has
been persistently problem[**Name (NI) 115**] and painful despite many
operations
over many years.  He has been told that nonsurgical management
is
best.  As for his ipsilateral left knee, which Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] has
referred to me for treatment, it will be best served with a
total
knee arthroplasty.  I refer to the note from [**2130-11-9**],
which extensively outlines their conversation six weeks ago and
his referral in my direction.  Basically, this patient has had
eight different arthroscopic procedures performed on the left
knee.  He originally had discoid meniscus, subsequently
developed
osteoarthritis, and at this point has had no improvement with
the
most recent couple of meniscectomies/chondroplasties.  This is
not, however, his only problem.  [**Name (NI) **] is disabled for the past
several years with a combination of ankle pain and knee pain.
He
is status post lumbar surgeries with radicular symptoms and
polyneuropathy.  He has also had cervical spine operations in
the
past.

[**2131-1-13**] - xrays of L knee show good hardware alignment without
complication

[**2131-1-13**] - CXR - no acute cardiopulmonary changes

[**2131-1-13**] - CT PE IMPRESSION:
No evidence of large central filling defects within the
pulmonary
arteries. However, given suboptimal contrast administration,
more distal
pulmonary emboli within the segmental and subsegmental arterial
branches
cannot be excluded. Repeat study could be performed if
clinically indicated.

[**2131-1-16**] - ECHO
The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal
cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion
abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Right ventricular chamber
size is normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic
stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Normal left ventricular
cavity sizes with preserved global systolic function.

[**2131-1-16**] - LE doppler
IMPRESSION: No evidence of DVT.

[**2131-1-17**] - CXR
FINDINGS: The monitoring and support devices are in unchanged
position. The right upper lobe is now better ventilated than on
the previous radiograph.  The size of the cardiac silhouette is
unchanged. The remaining lung  parenchyma has identical
appearance. Small retrocardiac areas of hypoventilations, but no
newly appeared focal parenchymal opacities suggestive of
pneumonia. The left costophrenic sinus is not completely
depicted, costophrenic sinus is without signs of pleural
effusion.

[**2131-1-17**] - CT PE
1. Limited study for the evaluation of pulmonary embolism due to
body
habitus, breathing motion artifact, and poor opacification of
the pulmonary
artery. No evidence of central or lobar pulmonary embolism.
Although the
study is sub-optimal, the previously described questionable
filling defect in
the left lower lobe branch of the pulmonary artery are not
confirmed in this
study.

2. Endotracheal tube terminates at 2.6 cm above the carina.

3. Bilateral small upper lobe atelectasis, right greater than
left.

4. Fatty liver.

[**2131-1-18**] - CXR

Moderate cardiomegaly is unchanged. There are low lung volumes.
Biapical
medial atelectases are unchanged. There are no pleural
effusions. Left IJ
catheter tip is in the left brachiocephalic vein.


Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted on [**2131-1-11**] and, later that day, was
taken to the operating room by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for L TKA without
complication.  Please see operative report for details.
Postoperatively the patient did well.  The patient was initially
treated with a PCA followed by PO pain medications on POD#1.
The patient received IV antibiotics for 24 hours
postoperatively, as well as lovenox for DVT prophylaxis starting
on the morning of POD#1.  ***The patient was placed in a CPM
machine with range of motion that started at 0-45 degrees of
flexion before being increased to 90 degrees as tolerated.***
The drain was removed without incident on POD#1. The Foley
catheter was removed without incident. The surgical dressing was
removed on POD#2 and the surgical incision was found to be
clean, dry, and intact without erythema or purulent drainage.

While in the hospital, the patient was seen daily by physical
therapy. Labs were checked throughout the hospital course and
repleted accordingly. At the time of discharge the patient was
tolerating a regular diet and feeling well.  The patient was
afebrile with stable vital signs. The patient's hematocrit was
stable, and the patient's pain was adequately controlled on a PO
regimen. The operative extremity was neurovascularly intact and
the wound was benign. The patient was discharged to
rehabilitation in
