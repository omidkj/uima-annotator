Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 618**]
Chief Complaint:
Acute Left Upper Extremity Weakness and New-Onset Seizure in the
setting of Dialysis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
* Intubation
* Bronchoscopies

History of Present Illness:
79 yo F with hx ESRD on HD T,Th,S, IDDM, HTN, HLD, and
diastolic dysnfunction, sent via ambulance to the [**Hospital 8**]
Hospital from HD [**11-11**] for concern of cyanosis, left arm
twitching
and weakness.  Patient is unable to provide history and history
is obtained from chart review and son, [**Name (NI) **] ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 77884**]),
contact[**Name (NI) **] via telephone.  The patient normally gets dialysis on
Saturday but was postponed to Sunday this week due to the
holiday.  As per her son, she had a mild cough over the last 2-3
days but was otherwise in her usual state of health.  After
approximately one hour of hemodialysis, the patient was noted to
have an acute onset of left arm pain, weakness as well as facial
cyanosis with shortness of breath.  She also complained of
headache and an impending sense of doom.   She was started on 6L
nasal cannula and had bp 180/90 and HR 95.  She had an O2 sat of
94% (but unclear whether or not was on O2).  She had stated all
of her symptoms had improved with oxygen.  She was also noted to
have left arm jerking which as per patient started after being
"pricked with needles many times" prior to dialysis.  She had
also reported some left suprascapular pain present over the past
several days, occasionally radiating to the left temple and
sharp, non-radiating left forearm pain.  She was sent to the
[**Hospital 8**] Hospital Emergency Department for further evaluation.
There she had complained of left neck pain and pain at the left
elbow as well as LUE weakness.  As per assessment in the ED she
was noted to have 4+/5 LUE and LLE strength and downgoing toes.
A subsequent note stated 2/5 strength in the LUE with mute toes.

In the ED she had a CT head which was negative for any acute
intracranial process and received ASA 325 mg x1 and she was
transferred to the floor.  On arrival to the medical floor, the
patient was noted to have continued jerking movements of her
left
arm.  She was alert and oriented and complained of left arm
weakness.  This transformed into a gneralized grand mal seizure
with LOC but no tongue biting or incontinence around 8 PM,
lasting "minutes" and received 2.5 mg ativan IV.  Since episode
she remained unconscious with response only to painful stimuli.
She had a repeat CT head which was negative.  She was examined
by
neurology and reported to be somnolent and grimaces to deep pain
but moving only the right side of her body.  ROS as per chart
review was also notable for chest pressure, vomiting x1 and
transient blurry vision, "difficulty forming words and
formulating words," and increased frequency of urination.  She
was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further care.

Physical Exam:
Physical Exam;
VS; T 99.2, BP 123/55, P 73, RR 24, 95% on 4L
Gen; lying in bed, eyes closed, NAD
HEENT; NC/AT, no nuchal rigidity.
CV; RRR, +S1,S2, no murmurs
Pulm; Faint bibasilar crackles
Abd; soft, NT, ND
Extr; no edema.  Radial pulses equal and symmetric.
Neuro;
Mental status; lying in bed, eyes closed.  Sometimes will open
eyes briefly to voice (for seconds) and other times requires
light pressure to arouse.  Briefly mumbled phrase likely in
Portuguese but otherwise nonverbal.  Appeared to squeeze hands
to
command but did not follow other commands (but also ? of
language
barrier).
CN; PERRL 3mm-->2mm.  Upon opening eyes, are in mid position and
vestibulo-occular reflex intact.  Corneals present.  Left
nasolabial fold flattening.
Motor; Normal bulk and tone.  Occasional rhythmic flexion of
left
forearm witnessed during encounter, lasting for approx 20-30
seconds then resolving spontaneously, occurred twice.
Spontaneous movement in RUE, RLE and LLE and withdrew LUE
minimally to pain.  Would not follow commands for motor
assessment but when arms are held outward, her arm on left falls
to bed more briskly than on right.
Sensory; withdraws all extremities to noxious stimuli
Reflexes; trace in bicep, tricep, brachioradialis, 0 in
patellars
and achilles b/l.  Toes are mute.
Coordination; unable to assess
Gait; unable to assess

Imaging:

CXR: [**2172-1-16**]:
The ET tube tip is 6 cm above the carina. The NG tube tip is in
the stomach.  The right central venous line tip is at the level
of mid SVC.

There is interval improvement in pulmonary edema which is still
moderate. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable. No
appreciable pleural effusion is
seen, although is most likely present bilaterally.

CXR: [**2172-1-13**]:
Indwelling devices are in standard position, and
cardiomediastinal
contours appear unchanged. Improving perihilar areas of
atelectasis, but
development of streaky peribronchiolar opacities at the right
lung base, which could be due to aspiration, atelectasis or
developing infectious pneumonia.

MRI/A head and neck [**2172-1-13**]:

1. Subacute cortical infarcts involving the right frontal lobe,
predominantly
the precentral gyrus, as well as the focal area within the left
precentral
gyrus. The distribution suggests a proximal source.

2. Multifocal intracranial atherosclerotic disease is most
severe within the
cavernous segment of the left internal carotid artery where
there is moderate
stenosis without high-grade stenoses or intracranial vascular
malformation.

3. Extensive chronic microvascular white matter ischemic disease
with an old
lacunar infarct within the pons.

4. Bone marrow signal within the calvarium and cervical spine is
more
hypointense than expected on T1-weighted imaging and should be
correlated with
any history of anemia, smoking or myeloproliferative processes.


CXR [**2172-1-13**]:
AP chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest radiographs:

Heterogeneous opacification in the left mid and lower lung and
right lower
lobe could represent asymmetric pulmonary edema, but pneumonia
is more likely,
particularly on the right. Heart is borderline enlarged.
Thoracic aorta is
generally large and heavily calcified but not focally
aneurysmal.
Supraclavicular central venous infusion catheter ends low in the
SVC. No
pneumothorax or appreciable pleural effusion.

EEG [**2172-1-13**]:
This is an abnormal portable EEG due to slowing and
