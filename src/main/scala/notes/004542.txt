   WOUND CULTURE (Final [**2188-8-26**]):    No significant growth.

Stool.
   CLOSTRIDIUM DIFFICILE TOXIN ASSAY (Final [**2188-8-22**]):
      FECES NEGATIVE FOR C. DIFFICILE TOXIN BY EIA.
      Reference Range:  Negative.
.
MRI Pelvis:  Slight improvement of right sacroiliitis at the
inferior/posterior aspects of the joint, with unchanged
appearance at the
anterior/superior aspect of the joint.  No drainable fluid
collection.
.
CT C-spine:  Question of rotation versus rotary subluxation of
C1 on C2. Cervical spondylosis.  Other findings as noted above.
.
CT head: Technically limited study due to patient motion.  No
definite signs for an intracranial hemorrhage.
.
CT C-spine (flex/ext): Degenerative changes, particularly at
C4-C5 and C5-6.  No evidence of instability.
.
EEG: This is an abnormal EEG in the drowsy state due to the
presence of diffuse background slowing as well as bursts of
generalized [**1-7**] Hz slowing. These abnormalities suggest an
encephalopathy, which may be seen with medications, toxic
metabolic abnormalities or infections.
.
U/S chest: Ultrasound of the right anterior chest wall in the
site of the previous Port- A-Cath was performed.  In the
subcutaneous area, note is made of an area of low echogenicity
which measures 0.8 x 0.8 x 1.8 cm.  This represents a small
pocket of fluid which may be resolving post Port-A-Cath removal.
.
MR [**Name13 (STitle) 2854**]:  Mild degenerative changes.  No evidence of discitis
or
osteomyelitis in the thoracic region.  No evidence of spinal
cord compression or abnormal intrinsic signal within the spinal
cord.
.
MR [**Name13 (STitle) **]:  Signal changes within the L5-S1 disc with subtle
enhancement are suspicious for early changes of discitis.  No
epidural mass or epidural phlegmon seen or paraspinal abscess
identified.  Mild degenerative changes. Findings suggestive of
previous fusion at L4-L5 level.
.
Video oropharyngeal swallow: Mild oropharyngeal dysphagia
resulting in trace aspiration of thin liquids.  A small
esophageal web is noted.
.
Barium swallow:  Limited study. No obstruction or strictures
within the esophagus.
.
TTE: The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity size, and systolic function are normal (LVEF
70%). No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. There
is no ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size
and free wall motion are normal. There are three aortic valve
leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened. No
masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve. There is no
aortic valve stenosis. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. No mass or
vegetation is seen on the mitral valve. The estimated pulmonary
artery systolic pressure is normal. No vegetation/mass is seen
on the pulmonic valve. There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed)
of [**2188-7-23**], no major change is evident. The absence of a
vegetation by 2D echocardiography does not exclude endocarditis
if clinically suggested.
.
TEE: 1. The left atrium is dilated.
2. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left
ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
3. There are mobile, complex (mobile) atheroma in the aortic
arch.
4. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
5. No echocardiographic evidence of endocarditis is seen.
.
CXR [**2188-9-1**]:
No evidence of pneumonia or failure is present.
