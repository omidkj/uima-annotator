Admission Date:  [**2201-8-21**]       Discharge Date:  [**2201-8-27**]


Service:  CCU

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Unstable angina.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 83-year-old
Russian-speaking gentleman with a history of coronary artery
disease, status post LAD stent on [**3-2**].  His history is also
significant for CHF exacerbation secondary to ischemic
cardiomyopathy, an EF of less than 30% with 2+ mitral regurg.
On admission, he presented through EMS with a complaint of
unremitting 10/10 chest pain associated with shortness of
breath and diaphoresis.  EKG revealed an A-paced rhythm with
left bundle branch pattern at a rate of 65.  QTC was 498 and
was AV paced.  There were no changes from previous studies.
On the first set events, the cardiac troponin-T was 0.07 and
the CK was 191.

In the Emergency Department, the patient received morphine,
sublingual Nitroglycerin, Combivent inhaler, Solu-Medrol 125,
Nitroglycerin drip, heparin drip, Lopressor x 3 does, and
Mucomyst.  With his unremitting pain, the patient was taken
to cardiac catheterization.  Prior to this, he required
intubation due to worsening dyspnea from pulmonary edema.
Following the cardiac cath, the patient was admitted to the
CCU for further care.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Not obtained.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives with wife who has
[**Name (NI) 2481**] disease.  He has two daughters who are involved.
Occasional alcohol.  One cigarette per day.  No illicit
drugs.

LABS ON ADMISSION:  White blood cell count 10.6, hemoglobin
13.3, hematocrit 43, platelets 229.  PT 12.7, PTT 24.2, INR
1.1.  UA - straw colored, specific gravity 1.019, negative
nitrites, negative leukocytes.  CK 191, cardiac troponin
0.07.

Cardiac echo from [**2201-7-27**] showed a mildly dilated LA,
normal left ventricular wall thickness, mild decreased left
ventricular function apically inferior, and inferolateral.
Septal akinesis with midseptal hypokinesis.  Normal right
ventricular chamber size and wall motion.  Moderately dilated
aortic root.  A 2+ mitral regurg.

Cardiac cath results from [**2201-8-21**] - selective coronary
angiography with a left dominant system revealed three-vessel
coronary artery disease.  The main coronary artery was
patent.  The LAD had mild in-stent restenosis of
approximately 30%.  There was reversal of flow seen in the
septal perforating branches and mild diffuse disease in the
mid-LAD.  The first diagonal branch had an ostial 95%
stenosis which had been seen on a previous catheterization.
The second diagonal branch had midluminal irregularities.
The left circumflex coronary artery had mild plaquing
proximally with luminal irregularities extending into the
first obtuse marginal branch.  The second obtuse marginal was
diffusely diseased with a 90% stenosis in the more basal
branch.  The RCA was a small nondominant vessel with an
ostial 90% stenosis.  The large acute marginal branch had no
significant stenosis.  Resting hemodynamics revealed severely
elevated right-sided filling pressures with a mean RA
pressure of 25 mmHg and an RV-EDP of 44 mmHg.  Left-sided
filling pressures were severely elevated with a mean
pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 34 mmHg.  The RCA was
successfully stented.

HOSPITAL COURSE - 1) From the Cardiac Catheterization
Laboratory, the patient was transferred to the CCU intubated
and sedated.  In the CCU, the patient was hypotensive with a
systolic blood pressure to the 60s.  He received a propofol
bolus, 250 cc of fluid, and dopamine.  The dopamine was
quickly weaned off and pressures held in the 90s.  A Swan was
then placed in the femoral vein.  The patient was continued
on Lipitor, aspirin and Plavix.  His blood pressure
medications were held until his blood pressure was controlled
off dopamine.  By [**2201-8-23**], the patient was able to be
started back on his beta blocker and ACE inhibitor.  The
medications were titrated up.

2) CARDIAC RHYTHM:  The patient has a questionable history of
atrial fibrillation and was continued on amiodarone
throughout the admission.  He has a DDD pacer which is
functional.  He was monitored on tele throughout the
admission.

3) CARDIAC PUMP:  A cardiac echo was obtained on the day of
admission.  It was a limited study but revealed the left
ventricular cavity size to be normal.  The apex was akinetic.
The septum was hypokinetic.  There was a moderate left
ventricular systolic dysfunction.  The right ventricle was
normal in size and function.  There was a very small
pericardial effusion.  The patient's volume status was kept
even to slightly negative during admission.

4) PULMONARY:  The patient with respiratory impairment
secondary to pulmonary edema.  On [**2201-8-22**], the patient was
started on clindamycin for aspiration pneumonia.
Successfully extubated on [**2201-8-22**] ended well with little
to no oxygen requirement.

5) RENAL:  The patient has chronic renal insufficiency.  He
was given Mucomyst and IV hydration prior to the cardiac
cath.  His creatinine was monitored throughout the
hospitalization and trended down nicely following the cardiac
cath.

6) GI:  The patient was started on Protonix for GI
prophylaxis.

7) PSYCH:  The patient with a long history of anger
management issues/PTSD.  Also a history of depression and
apathy.  The patient had many episodes of agitation during
the hospitalization.  His family believes this is due
primarily to his inability to understand English and
difficulties in communication between the patient and staff.
He was given a variety of medications during periods of
agitation including very low doses of ativan and Olanzapine.
However, the patient was sedated for long periods of time
following these medications and they should be avoided.  On
[**2201-8-25**], all psych medications and sedatives were
discontinued.  By the morning of [**2201-8-26**], the patient was much
more alert and responsive.  His confusion had lessened, and he
was oriented to his family and himself.

facility.
