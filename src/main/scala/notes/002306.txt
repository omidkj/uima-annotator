Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 358**]
Chief Complaint:
Chief complaint:Respiratory distress

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation and mechanical ventilation


History of Present Illness:
67F with extensive cardiac history and COPD with
post-intubation tracheal stenosis, s/p tracheal decannulation
and tracheocutaneous fistula. Discharged from ENT service [**9-20**]
after tracheocutaneous fistula closure; her hospital course was
complicated by respiratory failure requiring intubation, MRSA
bacteremia/RLL PNA completed a course of vancomycin, discharged
home with BiPap at night on a course of bactrim. Has history of
pseudomonas PNA. Overnight on evening of admission had acute SOB
after getting up OOB to use bathroom. Reports feeling very
anxious, put on CPAP, able to sleep for an our, awoke again with
severe SOB and presented to OSH ED. Reports jaw pain is her
anginal equivalent but did not experience this during the
episode. No chest pain. Has been coughing, producing white
sputum, though no more than prior to last discharge. Subjective
fevers this afternoon. No chills. Slight right hip pain although
not new. On 2L 02 at home, able to ambulate and climb stairs
without difficulty. No note of LE swelling or recent weight
gain.
Initially presented to [**Hospital 2725**] hospital, found to have RLL PNA
on CXR and new leukocytosis, transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] ED. In our ED,
tried off BiPap, desatted to 80s on NRB. Got CTX, azithromycin
lasix and 500NS at OSH at [**Location (un) **] was flown here. In our ED,
initial VS 98.5 HR 80s BP 95/44 20 98% BiPAP, given 1 dose of
levaquin.

chronic wean facility but unable to decannulate. Bronchoscopy
revealed tracheomalacia of subglottic region.

Peep/PS 6/6 TVs 400s.
General: Awake, alert, mildly anxious, tachypneic.
HEENT: NCAT, MM dry. Hoarse voice
Neck: supple, inspiratory wheeze on ascultation of trachea
(louder than in lungs), + JVD with HJR. s/p tracheocutaneous
fistula repair with bandage c/d/i, incision still partially open
with sm amount white drainage. No surrounding erythema. No
crepitus.
Pulmonary: No crackles, inspiratory wheeze. Decreased at right
base.
Cardiac: Distant. RR, nl S1 S2, no murmurs, rubs or gallops
appreciated
Abdomen: soft, NT, ND, normoactive bowel sounds, no masses or
organomegaly noted
Extremities: No edema, 2+ radial, DP pulses b/l
Neurologic: Alert, oriented x 3. Able to relate history without
difficulty. Cranial nerves II-XII intact. Normal bulk, strength
and tone throughout. No abnormal movements noted. No deficits to
light touch throughout.
Per ENT note:
FOE: nasopharynx unremarkable. Moderate supraglottic edema at
the level of the false cords. No erythema or exudates. Bilat
true vocal folds with no edema, movement is symmetric. Good
approximation. Scant pooling of thick mucus in the pyriform
sinuses bilat.

Imaging:
.
CXR: Persistent RLL infiltrate. Fluid overload worse than prior
([**9-20**])
.
TTE [**2138-9-12**]: The left atrium is moderately dilated. There is
mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. Due to suboptimal technical
quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully
excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic function is grossly
normal (LVEF 60%). However, the basal inferior wall is
dyskinetic and tha posterior wall is hypokinetic. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
number of aortic valve leaflets cannot be determined. The aortic
valve is not well seen. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the
severity of mitral regurgitation may be significantly
UNDERestimated.] The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests
impaired relaxation. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure
could not be determined. There is no pericardial effusion.
.
EKG:
Sinus rhythm at 92 nl axis, nl intervals. Q waves in II, III,
aVF. TWI V4-V6. Early r-wave progression. No change from prior.



Brief Hospital Course:
MICU COURSE:
Pt was transferred from OSH ED on [**9-22**] in respiratory distress on
bipap.  Bipap was weaned off during the first hospital day. CTA
negative for PE. She was initially treated with Vanc/Levo/Zosyn
for ?PNA; these were discontinued on [**9-25**] as no clinical evidence
of infection.  She was also initially treated with IV steroids
per ENT for upper airway edema. On [**9-24**] the patient developed
sudden onset respiratory distress and desatted into the 50s.
She was emergently intubated. This was thought to be due to
flash pulmonary edema vs mucous plug.  She subsequently did
well, and was taken to the OR for bronchoscopy on [**9-25**]; no upper
airway etiology of her respiratory failure was found.  She was
extubated for the procedure but reintubated due to
lethargy/sedation post procedure.  She was then extubated on
[**9-26**].
Of note, she developed a small troponin leak in the setting of
her respiratory distress. She was continued on her home cardiac
medications.

MEDICAL FLOOR COURSE:
## Respiratory distress:  Patient was stable on xfer to the
floor.  Her O2 requirement was weaned and she was back to
baseline 2L NC prior to discharge.
.
## ARF:Ddx includes pre-renal in setting of possible infection
vs ATN/AIN from meds given during last hospitalization.
Stabilized prior to discharge.
.
## CAD: No evidence for ischemia on ecg.  Had slight trop leak
in setting of acute resp decompensation in the ICU.  Thought not
ACS.  Continued home meds.
.
## CHF:Clinically and by CXR and BNP pt appeared moderately
volume overloaded on presentation.  She was diuresed and
discharged on home meds.
.
## COPD:Treated for exacerbation
.
## Depression/anxiety:
-ativan needed to be scheduled given her severe anxiety.
-Continued home lamotrigine, quetiapine, sertraline
.
## OSA:
-BiPAP or CPAP at night
.
## Hyperlipidemia:
-Continued statin
.
