Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 106**]
Chief Complaint:
vomiting, diarrhea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
left IJ central venous catheter; PICC

History of Present Illness:
HPI: 86 y/o F h/o CAD, CHF, DM, AFib on coumadin, and chronic c.
diff colitis on PO vanco a/w vomiting and diarrhea x 2 days. She
began having more frequent formed BM's approx. 1 week PTA, at
which time the patient's daughter increased vancomycin from 250
mg daily to QID. However it is unclear whether this was given as
there was a new home health aide caring for the patient. 2 days
PTA she developed anorexia and nausea associated with poor oral
intake, had a few episodes of non-bloody vomiting and [**9-30**]
non-bloody episodes of diarrhea. Notably, she has not vomited
during past bouts of C. diff. She has not had fever, chills, URI
symptoms, abdominal pain, sick contacts, recent antibiotics
(other than PO vanco) or recent travel.
.
Over the past two weeks, she had had a [**12-21**] lb. weight gain and
has felt more lethargic, reportedly similar to how she has
during past episodes of fluid retention. Per the home health
aide, the patient has had more labored breathing and O2sats in
the low 90s on room air, requiring oxygen in the daytime, a rare
occurence for her. The daughter reports increasing her dose of
lasix to as much as 160 mg daily in an attempt to remove some
fluid. The patient has stable chronic 5-pillow orthopnea and
uses 2 L oxygen at night. She has not had dizziness,
lightheadedness, CP, palpitations, cough, SOB, or DOE. She was
seen in cardiology clinic the day prior to admission, at which
time routine labs revealed BUN 38/Cr 2.1/K 5.9. She was
instructed by her cardioligst's office to stop taking the [**Last Name (un) **],
potassium, and diuretics and to come to the ED.
.
In the ED, initially afebrile HR 83 BP 100/48 RR 20 O2sat 96% RA
100% 4LNC. She was reportedly guaiac negative. K+ peaked at 6.9
(D50 & insulin given) f/b 5.2. WBC 11.3 with 83% PMNs, no bands.
Lactate 5.5 f/b 4.1. INR 3.4. A left IJ was placed. She was
given just 1 L NS in light of severe systolic dysfunction. SBP
never dropped below 100, MAP ranged 55-78, with HR 50's-70's.
CVP ranged 6-11 cmH20, ScvO2 65-78. She had minimal urine
output. She was treated with IV flagyl for presumed C. diff
colitis, and IV ampicillin and cefepime for +U/A. CXR revealed
bilat effusions R>L and cephalization c/w CHF. Abd/pelvis CT w/o
contrast preliminarily showed intraperitoneal free fluid and
colonic wall thickening predominantly on the right c/w
third-spacing or infectious colitis. She was transferred to the
ICU for observation and further management of CHF and ARF.
.
In the ICU, patient had a TTE which showed worsening of her EF
to 15%, pulmonary hypertension, and severe aortic stenosis.  On
[**7-8**], patient was started on hydralazine to decrease afterload.
On [**7-9**], lasix and albumin were added, and patient's UOP
increased to 40 cc/h. Patient's progress notes were reviewed.

Pertinent Results:
CXR - There is multichamber cardiomegaly with bibasilar
effusions and some upper lobe venous diversion. The findings are
suggestive of congestive heart failure. A left-sided unipolar
cardiac pacemaker is seen with the tip projected over the right
ventricle. There are degenerative changes noted in the thoracic
spine.
.
CT ABD/PELVIS w/o contrast (prelim) - large right pleural
effusion and small left effusion with right lower lobe opacity
could reflect atelectasis or pneumonia; intraperitoneal free
fluid and colonic wall thickening predominantly on the right,
could reflect third spacing other differential includes
infectious colitis, including C diff. Study not equipped for
evaluation of bowel ischemia due to lack of IV contrast which
remains in the differential
.
TTE [**7-5**] - The left atrial volume is markedly increased
(>32ml/m2). The right atrium is markedly dilated. No atrial
septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
There is severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction
with akinesis of the inferior wall, mild hypokinesis of the
basal inferolateral, lateral and anterolateral segments and
severe hypokinesis of the other segments. There are three aortic
valve leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets are severely
thickened/deformed. There is severe aortic valve stenosis (area
<0.8cm2). Moderate (2+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The mitral valve shows
characteristic rheumatic deformity. Mild to moderate ([**12-21**]+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the
severity of mitral regurgitation may be significantly
UNDERestimated.] Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation
is seen. There is severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Significant pulmonic regurgitation is seen. There is a small
posterior pericardial effusion. There are no echocardiographic
signs of tamponade. Echocardiographic signs of tamponade may be
absent in the presence of elevated right sided pressures.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2134-9-21**],
overall LV systolic function may be slightly worse. The
esitmated pulmonary artery systolic pressures are now higher.
The degrees of valvular abnormalities are similar. There is a
small pericardial effusion seen on the current study that was
present on the prior but not mentioned in the report.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 86 y/o F h/o CAD, CHF, DM, AFib hypertherapeutic on
coumadin, and chronic c. diff colitis on recently elevated dose
of PO vanco a/w vomiting and diarrhea with evidence of colitis,
and acute on chronic renal failure in the setting of escalating
diuresis.
.
#Acute on chronic renal failure - Patient presented with acute
on chronic renal failure. Her Cr has been steadily improving,
and yesterday, her Cr was 1.4 (baseline). Patient's UOP has been
increasing, and she put out 700 cc yesterday.
- Goal UOP >20-30 cc/h
- Holding K
- Continue Lasix 40 mg PO BID
- Begin Metolazone 2.5 mg daily
.
#Acute on chronic systolic heart failure - TTE revealed worsened
valve and LV function c/w exam [**9-24**]; substantial pleural
effusions but no respiratory compromise. CEs negative, ECG
unchanged, no new findings on TTE so unlikely recent ischemic
event precipiated this decompensation.
- Continue BB and [**Last Name (un) **], Lasix, and Metolazone
- Titrate O2 to maintain sat >92%.
- Continue digoxin
.
# possible Burisitis- patient with reproducible pain with
lifting left leg, but not with bending left knee localized to
top of femur, likely musculoskeletal, ordered x-rays soft
tissue/ bone to reassure daughter (no like pain in right leg)
- femur xr showed degenerative changes, f/u as outpt
.
#. UTI: Patient had a U/A yesterday which showed moder
