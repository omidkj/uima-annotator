Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2387**]
Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Right renal artery catheterization and stenting
Right renal artery gelfoam embolization
Temporary hemodialysis line placement
Exploratory laparotamy
Right hemicolectomy
Intubation and mechanical ventilation

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 71 year old with DM2, HTN, HLD, extensive
vasculopathy including CAD s/p RCA stent [**2161**], bifemoral disease
s/p L common iliac stent x 2, aortic stent who was transferred
from [**Hospital3 1280**] Hospital for stenting of renal artery stenosis.
Catheterization occurred on [**2172-3-31**] and was complicated by
post-procedure hypotension and retroperitoneal bleed. She was
hypotensive to SBPs in 40s tachycardic to 140s. Due to concern
for perinephric/RP bleed a massive transfusion protocol was
initiated. Ms. [**Known lastname **] was intubated, a dirty right femoral trauma
line was placed, and she was maintained on pressors (ultimately
requiring 3 pressors - dopamine, levo, and neo). ACT was 150,
and 10 of protamine was given.
Ms. [**Known lastname **] was taken emergenty for CTA of the abdomen which
demonstrated a large perinephric hemorrhage with extension into
the retroperitoneum. She was taken to IR where 3 peripheral
branches of the right renal artery was embolized, and a HD line
was placed under sterile procedure in the RIJ. In total 11 units
of PRBCs, 4 of FFP and 2 of platelets. Due to persistent
hyperkalemia (K of 6.4) she was given calcium gluconate, insulin
and dextrose. Several amps of bicarb were administered for
persistent lactic acidosis (HCO3 ~18-19) with ABG
7.17/43/116/17. Increasing abdominal girth and increasing peak
pressures to 40 were noted during the procedure, and surgery was
consulted for possible compartment syndrome.
.
Ms. [**Known lastname **] initially presented to [**Hospital1 **] on Thursday when her
BP was elevated to 200s whilst recieving procrit, per the family
her BP was in the 150s at home. She was treated for a CHF
exacerbation thought to be secondary to flash pulmonary edema.
Her BP was managed with labetalol 600 [**Hospital1 **], Isosorbide
Mononitrate 90 mg QD, Hydralazine 25mg [**Hospital1 **], and Lasix 80 mg QD.
RUS demonstrated > 60% stenosis of the R renal artery. While at
[**Hospital1 **] they were able to diurese her and improve her
respiratory status, but her renal function worsened from a
baseline Cr of 2.4 to 3.8 on transfer. Upon transfer to [**Hospital1 18**],
vitals were 97.7 163/67 84 20 91/2L.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,
ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

Pertinent Studies:
CT abdomen
IMPRESSION:
1. Multiple foci of active extravasation from the right kidney
with extensive
perinephric, and other retroperitoneal hematoma as well as
extension of
hematoma into the mesentery.
2. Moderate bilateral pleural effusions as well as moderate
pericardial
effusion, likely related to recent volume resuscitation.
3. Extensive vasculopathy as delineated above.
4. Heterogeneous hepatic attenuation, raising the possibility of
partial
hepatic infarction.

TTE:
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
There is trivial pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Emergent study with poor parasternal and apical
views. With this limitation, the study is notable for normal
biventricular function and trivial pericardial effusion. Cannot
assess for mitral or tricuspid regurgitation.

Embolization Report:
HT RENAL ANGIOGRAM AND GELFOAM EMBOLIZATION, FOLLOWED BY
