Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5141**]
Chief Complaint:
hypoxia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
thoracentesis

History of Present Illness:
75 YOM with history of HTN who had progressive DOE and fatigue
over the fall with two courses of ABX for PNA with no
improvement.  He was sent for a CT of the chest [**2182-1-18**] which
revealed findings consistent with lung cancer in the left field
with metastases to the right lung, liver, bones and likely
adrenal glands.  He underwent a left sided thoracentesis on
[**2182-1-24**] with removal of 2L of fluid.  The cytology from the
pleural effusion showed adenocarcinoma with immunostains of the
tumor cells positive for CK7, [**Last Name (un) **]-31 and TTF-1.  He subsequently
underwent MR of the head and thoracic spine on [**2182-1-30**] which
showed diffuse metastasis.
.
He went to [**Hospital **] clinic this afternoon with progressive worsening
of dyspnea. Had 2 L taken off and was direct admitted to floor
for observation overnight and plan for pleuradesis or possible
pleurex cath placement in the morning with subsequent transfer
to OMED.
.
On arrival to the floor he was sattign 84% on NRB and nursing
triggered and transferred the patient to MICU six.
.
On arrival to the MICU he is comfortable lying on his right side
with O2 sats of 955 on NRB. He had minimal pain at the site of
the thoracentesis.

CTA CHEST [**2182-2-1**]
1. Acute pulmonary embolus in the right main pulmonary artery
with extension
to the right upper, right middle, and right lower lobe segmental
and
subsegmental pulmonary arteries. Additionally, there is a focal
opacity in
the right lower lobe which can be representative of a developing
infarct
versus a developing pneumonia.
2. Large left perihilar mass with extension and circumscription
to all lobes of the left lung and complete collapse of the left
lower lobe. Additionally, hypodense foci within the collapsed
left lower lobe are highly suggestive of tumor. Evidence of
lymphangitic carcinomatosis is visualized in the left upper
lobe. Hilar and mediastinal lymphadenopathy is associated with
this tumor.
3. Two right lower lobe nodules which may be representative of
metastatic
foci, but are of unclear etiology. Additionally, there is
thickening of the anterior right pleura, which may be
representative of a metastatic focus.
4. Bilateral small pleural effusions.
5. Although severely limited evaluation of the abdominal
structures, the
non-opacified visualized portion of the upper abdomen
demonstrates a
hypodensity in the right lobe of the liver which may be
representative of a metastatic focus. Further characterization
with a dedicated abdominal study is recommended.

[**2182-2-1**] LENIs
Left peroneal vein thrombosis. Right lesser saphenous
(superficial) vein thrombosis.

[**2182-2-2**] TTE
The left atrium is elongated. Left ventricular wall thickness,
cavity size, and global systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%).
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion
abnormality cannot be fully excluded. The right ventricular
cavity is moderately dilated with mild global free wall
hypokinesis. There is abnormal systolic septal motion/position
consistent with right ventricular pressure overload. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is
not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. Moderate [2+]
tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is severe pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
Severe pulmonary hypertension. Moderately dilated right
ventricle with mild global systolic dysfunction. Normal global
left ventricular systolic function. Moderate tricuspid
regurgitation.

[**2182-2-1**] CXR:
FINDINGS: There continues to be large left pleural effusion and
there is a new right pleural effusion. There is hazy vasculature
bilaterally, left greater than right, compatible with fluid
overload. There continues to be some rightward mediastinal shift
similar compared to the film from the prior day.

[**2182-2-2**] CXR:
FINDINGS: There is complete opacification of the left hemithorax
with mediastinal shift towards the left. This is compatible with
increased fluid and associated volume loss. Right lung is clear
with the exception of some lower lobe alveolar infiltrate
medially similar in appearance to the CT scan from the prior
day.
IMPRESSION: Increased collapse of the left lung with complete
opacification of the left hemithorax.

[**2182-2-3**] CXR:
Compared to the prior study, there is no significant interval
change in complete opacification of the left hemithorax and
mediastinal shift to the left. There is a right lower lobe
infiltrate, similar in size compared to the study from the prior
day.

[**2182-2-11**] CT Head:
FINDINGS: There is no evidence of hemorrhage, edema, mass
effect, or infarction.
