History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 84119**] is an 85 year-old woman with resp failure/vent
dependent s/p trach, recent PEs, sCHF (EF 25%), AF, and PVD who
is transferred from rehab because of unresponsiveness and low
tidal volumes and is admitted to MICU for further management.
.
She was discharged on [**2169-1-13**] from the thoracics service after
presenting from an OSH with tracheal laceration in the setting
of traumatic intubation and sub-cutaneous emphysema
post-intubation.  Her recent history prior to that includes a
fall on [**10-31**] with a C2 odontoid fracture and diagnosis of PEs
in the setting of dyspnea on [**2168-12-10**] requiring intubation
(complicated by trach injury) for hypercapnea.  On the thoracics
service, she [**Date Range 1834**] multiple bronchoscopies and trach
placement ((#7 [**Last Name (un) 295**]) and revisions with clot demonstrated in
posterior trachea and trach dislodgement.  She was discharged on
trach cpap with cmv onvernight.  She was transitioned from CMV
ventilation to CPAP, and was able to tolerate trach collar for
unspecified periods of time.
.
At rehab, she had AMS/unresponsiveness which is different from
her baseline, and low tidal volumes on pressure support and was
transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.  ABG 7.24/44/91
(?may be an error) and 98.6 74 26 95/61 92% on fio2 40% per
rehab notes.
.
In the ED, vital signs were initially: 99 61  106/49 100% on
vent. CXR showed  pleural effusions but no acute findings and IP
was consulted and felt trach was in good position and she did
not need urgent intervention.  Thoracics was also notified and
will follow the patient.  Head CT neg.  UA was grossly positive
and cipro was started.  She was also on a heparin gtt on arrival
and this was stopped when coags returned within INR 6.  She was
then admitted for further management.
