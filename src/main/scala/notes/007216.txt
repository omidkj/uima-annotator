Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 13260**] was admitted and underwent mitral valve repair by
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1290**]. For surgical details, please see seperate
dictated operative note. Following the operation, she was
brought to the CSRU for invasive monitoring. Within 24 hours,
she awoke neurologically intact and was extubated. Her CSRU
course was uneventful and she transferred to the SDU on
postoperative day one. Chest tubes and wires were removed
without complication. She tolerated low dose beta blockade and
continued to improve with diuresis. Given persistent systolic
blood pressures in the 90 - 100mmHg range, her preoperative ACE
inhibitor was not resumed. Several self limiting bursts of
paroxysmal were noted but she remained mostly in a normal sinus
rhythm. She continued to make steady progress and was cleared
for discharge to home on postoperative day four. At discharge,
her oxygen saturations were 96% on room air and her chest x-rays
showed only small bilateral pleural effusions. Her sternum was
stable and all surgical incisions were clean, dry and intact.
