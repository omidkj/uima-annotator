Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5790**]
Chief Complaint:
Left lung cancer.


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Flexible bronchoscopy, left thoracoscopy, left thoracotomy and
left pneumonectomy, mediastinal lymph node dissection.


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 75909**] is a 57-year-old gentleman with a proximal left lung
cancer which had
obstructed the distal left mainstem. He also had a positive 4L
lymph node on TBNA. He received neoadjuvant chemotherapy and
radiation and had an excellent response radiographically. We
restaged him with cervical mediastinoscopy which was negative
for any persistent mediastinal nodal disease. There
was evidence of sterilized tumor in the 4L lymph node station.


Past Medical History:
1. T3N2 squamous cell carcinoma of the left main stem bronchus
diagnosed [**11-21**].  The initial tumor was a large, necrotic,
friable mass that completely occluded the left mainstem
bronchus; it was associated with left lung collapse and
bilateral hilar and right paratracheal adenopathy.  The tumor
was debrided and a stent was placed in early [**11-21**].  Treatment
with combination chemotherapy and XRT was started on [**2150-11-30**].
2. Pulmonary embolism [**11-21**].
3. Post-obstructive pneumonia [**11-21**].
4. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
5. Latent tuberculosis.
6. Pneumonia [**11-21**].

Social History:
70-pack-year smoking history.  He is living with his daughter,
[**Name (NI) **].  [**Name2 (NI) **] has three children, two daughters and one son, and he

[**2151-3-4**] Echocardiogram: Conclusions
The left atrium is mildly dilated. No spontaneous echo contrast
is seen in the left atrial appendage. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%). Transmitral and tissue
Doppler imaging suggests normal diastolic function, and a normal
left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). with moderate
global free wall hypokinesis. The ascending, transverse and
descending thoracic aorta are normal in diameter and free of
atherosclerotic plaque . The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic
regurgitation. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with
trivial mitral regurgitation.

CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2151-3-10**]
IMPRESSION:
1. Similar appearance of left pneumonectomy space compared to
recent postoperative radiograph but gradual increase in fluid
since earlier radiographs.
2. Mild interstitial edema within the right lung.


Brief Hospital Course:
Pt was admitted and taken to the OR for left pneumonectomy for
lung cancer. An epidural was placed for pain control w/ good
effect. Pt was transferred to the ICU for post op management
including brief IV vasopressor support. [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] drain was placed
in the left chest at the time of the operation and was d/c'd on
POD#1.
POD#1 an NGT was placed for decompression of a large gastric
bubble and was removed w/in 24 hrs. Pt was started on sips and
diet was progressed and [**Last Name (un) 1815**] well.
POD#3 epidural was d/c'd and pt was transferred out of the ICU.
He progressed well and steadily w/his post op recovery. On POD#4
pt had brief non-sustained episodes of Afib. Cardiology was
consulted and pt was treated w/ lopressor and amiodarone w/ good
response and conversion to NSR. Anticoag w/ IV heparin was
initiated for known PE. Pt had been on lovenox prior to surgery.
At the time of discharge pt was on coumadin w/ lovenox bridge.
He was ambulatory w/ sats 97% on room air.
