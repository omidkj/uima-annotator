Chief Complaint:
Chief Complaint: Seizure
Reason for MICU transfer: s/p intubation for combative
post-ictal state


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Endotracheal intubation

History of Present Illness:
This is a 58 year old gentleman with a history of recurrent
syncope and systolic heart failure (EF 35%) who presented to the
ED for pre-syncope w/u and was observed to have a tonic clonic
seizure with combative post-ictal state who was intubated for
airway protection.
.
In brief, he reports working outdoors yesterday in 90 degree
weather at his lumber construction company where he works as a
foreman. At 1 Pm he reported feeling light headed almost passing
out prompting him to go to [**Hospital 4199**] Hospital for evaluation.
After inital evaluation, he was going to be admitted for
cardiovascular w/u when he asked to be discharged to [**Hospital1 18**] where
his care is managed.
.
At [**Hospital1 18**] ED, initial vitals were: 98.8 95 151/83 18 98% 2L Nasal
Cannula.  Initial labs demonstrated troponin < 0.01, baseline
cbc and unremarkable chem10.  His reported presentation appeared
to be consistent with heat syncope.  He was observed overnight
in the ED with plan for IV hydration and discharge home in the
morning. This morning he was noted to have a generalized tonic
clonic seizure that lasted approximately 5 minutes which
resolved without intervention. His post ictal state was notable
for being unresponsive to verbal stimuli and significant
combativeness. Six people including security and 6mg IV ativan
did not sedate him.  He was noted to desat and was placed on a
non-rebreather. He was ultimately intubated for airway
protection.  A CT scan demosntrated no intracranial injury and
mild age inappropriate prominenence of the sulci which appeared
stable compared to prior imaging. A serum and urine tox screens
were added on to his prior samples and were notable for a
positive urine cocaine and negative for etoh.  Neurology was
consulted who evaluated and determined the patient and felt the
patients seizure was likely triggered by recent cocaine
ingestion, possible etoh withdrawal (despite negative tox
screen).  The description of prior episodes of
syncope/presyncope were felt to unlikely represent seizures and
did not appear to be related to the GTC today. Given absence of
findings on CT scan, his presenting seizure was felt to
represent an induced event rather than primary epilepsy.
Menigitis/encephalitis was considered, however given the absence
of infectious signs and absence of fever, a lumbar puncture was
not immediately recommended or pursued. Admission to the medical
ICU was obtained in the setting of the patients intubated state.
 Vitals on transfer were:
Meningitis/Encephalitis, given the lack of infectious
signs/symptoms, is very unlikely in this case but there would be
a low threshold for LP and empiric meningitis coverage if he
were
to develop fever.
.
On arrival: 98.4 73 141/80 95 100% on CMV Fio2 of 50%, RR 18,
PEEP 5 and Tv 500.
.
His wife was called who reported a recent history of 5
syncopal/presyncopal events 'blacking out' in the setting of
abstinence of etoh. Prior w/u at OSH and by his cardiologist
have revealed evidence of cardiomyopathy (EF 35%) attributed to
multivessel CAD vs etoh.  He used to drink 30 beers per day but
has cut back to 1 6pack and 2 nips per day. She reports he may
drink additional etoh at work where he is 6am-4pm in the
presence of friends.  Unsure if he does cocaine but she is aware
that cocaine does occur at work.  During the past 3 days he has
been especially tired at work and has not had any of the beer in
the fridge which is unuual. Believes last drink was a 2 pm two
days ago. Also notes significant decrease in short term memory,
family needs to write notes every where around the house for
directions. Has noted work more stressful given difficulty w/
memory and aging

EKG ([**2153-7-5**]):  NSR, LAD, LVH w/ ST flattening in lateral leads

AP CHEST X-RAY ([**2153-7-5**], prelim read): Endotracheal tube is in
the lower trachea near the carina. An enteric tube traverses
through the stomach. Lung volumes are low. Mild left basilar
atelectasis. The lungs are otherwise without a focal
consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax.
Cardiomediastinal silhouette appears moderately enlarged.
IMPRESSION:
1. Endotracheal tube appears in the lower trachea near the
carina. Retraction by 2.0 cm is recommended.
2. Moderate cardiomegaly.

NON-CONTRAST HEAD CT ([**2153-7-5**], final): There is no evidence of
acute hemorrhage, edema, large vessel territorial infarction,
shift of normally midline structures. The ventricles and sulci
again appear prominent for the patient's age, but stable.
[**Doctor Last Name **]-white matter differentiation appears well preserved. No
acute fractures are identified. Mild mucosal thickening is noted
in the ethmoidal and right maxillary sinuses.
IMPRESSION:
1. Stable appearance in comparison to the prior study with no
acute
intracranial process identified.  If clinical suspicion for an
acute
infarction is high, MR is the recommended study of choice.
2. Again identified is age-inappropriate prominence of sulci and
ventricles.

LIVER/GALLBLADDER ULTRASOUND ([**2153-7-5**]):
IMPRESSION:  Echogenic liver consistent with fatty infiltration.
 Other forms of liver disease and more advanced liver disease
including significant hepatic fibrosis/cirrhosis cannot be
excluded on this study.
