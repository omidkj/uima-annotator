Pertinent Results:
[**2137-5-7**] Intra-op TEE:
Conclusions
PRE-BYPASS: The left atrium is mildly dilated. No spontaneous
echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium
or left atrial appendage. No spontaneous echo contrast is seen
in the body of the right atrium. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal
(LVEF 50-55%). The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated
with normal free wall contractility. There are simple atheroma
in the ascending aorta. There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the
descending thoracic aorta. There is severe aortic valve stenosis
(valve area 0.8-1.0cm2). Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is
moderate thickening of the mitral valve chordae. There is no
pericardial effusion.

POST CPB:
1.Preserved [**Hospital1 **]-ventricular systolic function
2. A bioprosthetic valve is identified in aortic position. Well
seated and good leaflet excursion. Np AI. Peak transvslvular
gradient of 45 mm Hg, with carfiac output = 6.5 liters/min.
3. MR is now mild.
4. No other change

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was brought to the Operating Room on [**2137-5-7**] where
she underwent an Aortic Valve Replacement (#21 mm Biocor apical
tissue valve)with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  Overall the patient tolerated
the procedure well and post-operatively was transferred to the
CVICU in stable condition for recovery and invasive monitoring.
POD 1 found the patient extubated, alert and oriented and
breathing comfortably.  The patient was neurologically intact
and hemodynamically stable, weaned from inotropic and
vasopressor support.  Beta blocker, Statin, aspirin, and
diuresis was initiated and the patient was gently diuresed
toward her preoperative weight. POD#3 Mrs.[**Known lastname 110087**] was
transferred to the telemetry floor for further recovery.  Chest
tubes and pacing wires were discontinued without complication.
The patient was evaluated by the physical therapy service for
assistance with strength and mobility.  By the time of discharge
on POD #6 she was ambulating freely, the wound was healing and
pain was controlled with oral analgesia.  The patient was
discharged to [**Doctor First Name 37**] House Rehab & Nursing Center in
[**Location (un) 38**] in good condition. All follow up appointments were
advised.
