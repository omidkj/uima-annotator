Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1257**]
Chief Complaint:
Headache

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Bilateral Placement of External Ventricular Drains

History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 64 year-old male with a h/o HTN and
hypercholesterolemia who stopped his medications secondary to
financial difficulties who was transferred from [**Hospital3 **]
for a ICH.  Per report, he was at a wedding this evening when he
suddenly became confused and combative complaining of severe
headache.  He presented to [**Hospital3 3583**] via EMS and continued
to be combative and confused. He was moving all extremities but
was complaining of severe headache located in the back of his
head.

He was intubated and a head CT there showed, per report, a large
IVH with blood in the 3rd and 4th ventricles possibly coming
from the right caudate head, temporal horns mildly enlarged with
hydrocephalus and cerebral edema.  He has elevated blood
pressures with SBPs in the 250s that was non-responsive to
labetalol, but responded to propofol.  At this time, he was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].

In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, he was hypertensive on arrival with BP 180s,
intubated and sedated on propofol.

Past Medical History:
HTN
hypercholesterolemia

Social History:
The patient lives alone and has no children.  Per sister who was
at the bedside the patient has been estranged from his family
for ~8 years after a dispute over their house after their
parent's death.  The sister reports the patient having a history
of isolating himself and holding grudges.  He cleaned
homes and worked for himself.  He had a number of friends.  [**Name (NI) **]
has, per report, no smoking history, occasional etoh use and no
known drug use.  There is not an official HCP however there is
next of [**Doctor First Name **] in the greater [**Location (un) 86**] area  [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) **], sister
[**Telephone/Fax (1) 83725**]

Family History:
Per sister there is a significant family history of heart
disease.  Other family members with DM.  Also FH of difficult to
control HTN and ICH.

CT head [**2170-11-25**]:
1. Extensive intraventricular hemorrhage, likely with the right
basal ganglia source making hypertensive hemorrhage most likely.
Underlying mass or vascular lesion are additional causes, and
MRI is more sensitive for the detection.
2. Possible enlargement of the ventricles, although no remote
study is
available for confirmation.
3. Sulci are not well visualized, and this can be seen with
diffusely
elevated intracranial pressure. However, with the exception of
possible right ambient cistern asymmetry, there is no definite
effacement of the basal cisterns. Therefore, determination of
elevated intracranial pressure is somewhat equivocal; correlate
with patient's symptoms and consider followup and when
clinically necessary indicated.

CT C-spine [**2170-11-25**]:
No fracture or malalignment.

CXR [**2170-11-25**]:
1. Satisfactory placement of lines and tubes.
2. Evident moderate CHF

CTA head [**2170-11-25**]:
1. Intraventricular hemorrhage extending from right caudate
head. Bilateral frontal approach ventricular drains as described
above. Decreased size of the ventricles.
2. Except for tortuous vertebrobasilar system, no other
abnormalities are
seen on CT angiography of the head.

CT head [**2170-11-27**]:
1. Significant intraventricular hemorrhage involving the entire
ventricular system, unchanged in appearance from that noted on
most recent prior.  Involvement of the right caudate nucleus is
once again noted. 2. Bilateral transfrontal ventriculostomy
catheters are once again noted, unchanged in position from most
recent prior. Slight decrease in size of the left ventricle is
noted.
3. Persistent sulcal effacement and decreased conspicuity of
fissures
consistent with cerebral edema. Correlate clinically/ICP.

CT head [**2170-11-28**]:
1. Hemorrhage involving the entire ventricular system, unchanged
in
appearance from that noted on [**2170-11-27**]. The original
hemorrhage
appears to be centered within the head of the right caudate
nucleus suggesting hypertension as the likely cause of the
intraventricular hemorrhage.
2. Bilateral transfrontal ventriculostomy catheters are once
again noted,
unchanged in position from the most recent prior. The ventricles
are overall unchanged in size compared to the most recent prior.


Renal u/s with Doppler [**2170-12-1**]:
1. Limited study due to the patient's body habitus and portable
technique. No evidence of renal artery stenosis as described
above.
2. Echogenic liver, compatible with fatty infiltration. Please
note types of liver disease such as hepatic fibrosis or
cirrhosis cannot be excluded.

CT head [**2170-12-3**]:
Slight interval decrease in amount of intraventricular
hemorrhage. No new
hemorrhage is seen.

Echo [**2170-12-5**]:
Suboptimal image quality. Mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with preserved global biventricular systolic
function. No valvular pathology or pathologic flow identified.
Dilated ascending aorta.

LENIS [**2170-12-6**]:
1. Extensive left lower extremity DVT.
2. Technically limited study without definite evidence of DVT in
the right
lower extremity.

EEG [**2170-12-6**]:
Abnormal portable EEG due to the widespread uniform alpha to
beta frequency patterns. This generally represents medication
effect. There were no focal abnormalities (although
encephalopathies can obscure focal findings, as can
medications), and there were no epileptiform features.

Echo [**2170-12-6**]:
Normal right ventricular size and global systolic function. At
least mild left ventricular systolic dysfunction. Small
pericardial effusion.

Chest CTA [**2170-12-6**]:
Acute pulmonary emboli involving the right interlobar pulmonary
artery
extending into the right lower and middle lobar branches,
without evidence of right cardiac strain. Small-to-moderate
pericardial effusion.

RUE u/s [**2170-12-6**]:
Small amount of non-occlusive thrombus around the right PIC
catheter in the cephalic vein. Remainder of right upper
extremity veins are patent.

RUQ u/s [**2170-12-6**]:
No evidence of cholecystitis and no biliary dilatation seen.

Head CT [**2170-12-10**]:
1. Interval decrease in size of frontal and temporal [**Doctor Last Name 534**]
intraventricular
hemorrhage.
2. Unchanged opacification of the right maxillary, ethmoid, and
sphenoid
sinuses as well as the right nasal cavity.

Head CT [**2170-12-11**]:
Unchanged intraventricular hemorr
