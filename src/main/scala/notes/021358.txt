History of Present Illness:
66yo F with who presented with hyperkalemia (7.6) and DKA
(glucose 1249, + acetone and UA with ketones) with leukocytosis,
elevated lactate (6.9), and AG of 39. In ED patient was given
IVF's (6L) , insulin drip, and bicarb, as well as vanc 1gm/levo
500/flagyl500) for broad coverage. Of note, patient had been
recently admitted to ED with hypoglycemia, and an admission
prior to that for DKA. THe MUST protocol was initiated, and the
patient was sent to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for management.
.
In the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] the patient pt was treated with an Insulin gtt and
once her gap closed and plasma glucose fell below 250 mg/dL, she
was transitioned to SC insulin and D5W. [**Last Name (un) **] was consulted and
her serial cardiac enzymes ruled out cardiac ischemia as
precipitant of DKA. She was noted to be in ARF which responded
to fluid resuscitation. Psych and social work were consulted due
to concern for her underlying psychiatric disorder contributing
to medical noncompliance.
.
Currently the patient is without complaints. Specifically, she
denies chest pain, SOB, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea,

Brief Hospital Course:
The pt is a 66y F with Type I DM who presentes with recurrent
DKA after a recent ICU admission for DKA. The patient was
admitted in DKA with serum glucose of 1208.  The etiology was
thought to be likely inadequate insulin intake (noncompliance).
The pt was treated with an Insulin gtt and once her gap closed
and plasma glucose fell below 250 mg/dL, she was transitioned to
SC insulin and D5W. [**Last Name (un) **] was consulted and her serial cardiac
enzymes ruled out cardiac ischemia as precipitant of DKA. She
was noted to be in ARF which responded to fluid resuscitation.
The pt recovered well from her acute episode of DKA. due to
concern for recurrent episodes of DKA (this is the pt's 5th
admission for DKA over the last 6 months; presents to [**Hospital1 18**] and
other hospitals), social work was consulted. Psych was asked to
evalaute the pt due to concern for her underlying psychiatric
disorder contributing to medical noncompliance however they felt
that she was capable of making medical decisions and was not in
the midsts of a manic episode.  [**Last Name (un) **] made several adjustments
to her insulin regimen, however she continued to have swings in
her blood sugars from 100 to 260 without going back into DKA.
She was told to follow up with her [**Last Name (un) **] nurse [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **].
[**Name10 (NameIs) **] was sent home with VNA.
.
Of note, the J-wire for a central line kit was noted to be in
her venous system from her last admission.  This was removed by
interventional radiology through her IJ central line without
complications.  Presumably this was left in her from a femoral
line she had placed during her last admission 1.5 weeks prior.

She does have an anemia of chronic inflammation/disease.  Her
reticulocyte count is low.  Endocrine suggested that she may
have low Epo levels from autonomic dysfunction.  This lab can be
checked in the clinic.  If low she may benefit from Epo
injections.
