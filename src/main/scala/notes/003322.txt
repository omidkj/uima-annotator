History of Present Illness:
78 yo M with PMHx of ETOH use and HTN, was transferred to our ED
from the OSH ED for management of frostbite of hands, knees and
feet. He was in his USOH until yesterday evening when he had a
few drinks in the bar, then was unable to open the door to his
house and fell asleep in his doorsteps last night. ? fall from
the porch.   He woke this morning, got into the house, slept
some more, then woke up with increasing pain in his hands, feet
and knees.  He presented to the OSH ED on [**2123-1-24**] where his work
up was significant only for the abovementioned frostbite, for
which he was trasnferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED.
.
In our ED, he was evaluated by plastics (conservative
management).  He was also found to be withdrawing from ETOH
(tachycardic, hypertensive, hyperthermic and tremulous).  He was
given a total of 30 mg of Valium.  His respirations were noted
to be coarse, his O2 sat was 91% on RA, then 95% on a few liters
NC, then 100% on NRB.  CXR showed bibasilar atelectasis vs PNA.
His Tm was 102 rectally during a withdrawal episode. He was
given empiric ABXs (Vanc and Levofloxacin) here (got Unasyn at
the OSH).  Head CT neg.
.
For the first several hours of the ED stay he was found to have
no UOP.  He got a total of 3.5 L fluids.  Bladder scan showed
significant urinary retension.  Foley was changed to 20F: he put
out 1 L (with some hematuria and clots), then his SBP dropped to
70s--> spont back up to 100s.  Repeat CXR in the ED without
significant change. The pt then began to have coffee ground
emesis and the pt was intubated for airway protection (copious
oral secretions noted).

ROS prior to intubation: raspy voice; coughing up thick sputum;
loss of sensation in his fingers and his R great toe.
In the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] [**2123-1-24**] pt initially hypotensive upon arrival w/ SBP
70s but responded to IVFs without pressor requirement. Pt had
[**Hospital1 **] dressing changes for his frostbite wounds and was by
plastics.  He was extubated without complications on [**2123-1-25**].
Due to refusal to eat his NG tube was continued for medication
administration.  As his ankle was notes to be painful, X-rays
were performed and showed ankle fracture - ortho was contact[**Name (NI) **]
for evaluation with plans to cast.  Due to hypertension
metoprolol was started.  Out of concern for cellulitis
associated with frostbite as well as to cover possible
aspiration pneumonia, Unasyn was initiated. Regarding bloody
emesis, hct remained stable, GI consulted with plan to perform
EGD once stable.

Pertinent Results:
ABDOMEN ULTRASOUND: The liver is diffusely echogenic consistent
with fatty infiltration. No nodular outer contour is
appreciated. There is no intra or extrahepatic ductal
dilatation. The common bile duct measures 3 mm. The gallbladder
contains several stones. There is no gallbladder wall
thickening. There is a large cyst in the upper pole of the right
kidney, measuring up to 9 cm in diameter. A single thin
septation is seen within the cyst. The right kidney is otherwise
unremarkable. Two simple cysts are present within the left
kidney, with the largest at the lower pole measuring 1.8 cm in
diameter. The spleen is unremarkable. The pancreatic head is
normal.
IMPRESSION:
1. Echogenic liver consistent with fatty infiltration. Other
forms of liver disease and more advanced liver disease including
significant hepatic fibrosis/cirrhosis cannot be excluded on
this study.
2. Cholelithiasis.
.
RIGHT ANKLE: AP, oblique, and lateral views. Osseous detail is
obscured by the overlying cast. The distal fibular fracture is
again seen, with minimal distraction of the fracture fragments.
The ankle mortise is preserved. Pes planus is again noted.
Vascular calcifications are also again noted.
.
EGD ([**2123-2-2**]): ulceration of esophagus and stomache, antral
gastritis
.
ECHO:
MEASUREMENTS:
Left Atrium - Long Axis Dimension: *5.7 cm (nl <= 4.0 cm)
Left Ventricle - Septal Wall Thickness: *1.4 cm (nl 0.6 - 1.1
cm)
Left Ventricle - Inferolateral Thickness: *1.4 cm (nl 0.6 - 1.1
cm)
Left Ventricle - Diastolic Dimension: 4.7 cm (nl <= 5.6 cm)
Left Ventricle - Ejection Fraction: >= 70% (nl >=55%)
Aorta - Valve Level: 2.2 cm (nl <= 3.6 cm)
Aorta - Ascending: *3.7 cm (nl <= 3.4 cm)
Aortic Valve - Peak Velocity: 2.0 m/sec (nl <= 2.0 m/sec)
INTERPRETATION:
Findings:
LEFT ATRIUM: Moderate LA enlargement.
LEFT VENTRICLE: Mild symmetric LVH. Normal LV cavity size.
Suboptimal
technical quality, a focal LV wall motion abnormality cannot be
fully
excluded. Hyperdynamic LVEF.
RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.
AORTA: Normal aortic root diameter. Mildly dilated ascending
aorta.
AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets. No
valvular AS. The
increased transaortic gradient related to high cardiac output.
No AR.
MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. No MR.
TRICUSPID VALVE: Tricuspid valve not well visualized.
PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Pulmonic valve not well seen.
PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.
GENERAL COMMENTS: Suboptimal image quality - poor echo windows.

Conclusions:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric
left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Due to  suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall
motion abnormality cannot be fully  excluded. Left ventricular
systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%). Right  ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The ascending
aorta  is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no  valvular aortic stenosis. The increased
transaortic gradient is likely related  to high cardiac output.
No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve  leaflets are
mildly thickened. No mitral regurgitation is seen. There is no
pericardial effusion.



Brief Hospital Course:
Briefly, this is a 78 yo with h/o ETOH abuse who presented with
frostbite on hands, broken right ankle, and hematemesis
secondary to stomach/esophageal ulcers and gastritis. On arrival
the pt was admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] s/p intubation in the ED for
respiratory distress and airway protection.
.
1)ETOH abuse: He was written for CIWA protcol but never required
any valium.   He was started on daily thiamine and folate. He
was started on metoprolol 12.5 mg po tid for likely both
underlying baseline HTN and perhaps minor withdrawl. Social work
was consulted
.
2)Respiratory Distress: Initially in the [**Name (NI) **] pt had appearance of
increased resp. distress but was satting at 100% on NRB;
subsequently was intubated for airway protection in the setting
of coffee ground emesis.  Pt may have had another aspiration
event or had flash pulmonary edema s/p fluid resuscitation at
that time.  The pt was extubated [**1-25**] without diffficulty,
satting 100% on 50% shovel mask. TTE showed some mild diastolic
dysfunction with EF >70%, mild symmetric LVH; perhaps explaining
flash edema on admission.  Given mild rales on exa
