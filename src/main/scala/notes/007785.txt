History of Present Illness:
82yo M h/o Afib on coumadin, CAD who was gambling with his
wife yesterday at [**Name (NI) 71907**] and was riding the bus home when his
wife noticed that he became silent, responding only minimally to
her questions and saying he felt "lousy". He then vomited three
times around 7:15pm but had no change in his level of alertness.
He was brought to [**Hospital3 10310**] by EMS.

In EMS, his bp was 180/100 and his exam was described as a R
gaze
palsy, R drift and R facial droop.

Head CT found an IVH and he was transferred here. CBC there was
normal. INR 3.2 and he was given vitamin K.

In our ED, bp ranged from 160-210 and the patient was given
nipride briefly. He was loaded with dilantin 1g IV and also
given
2U FFP, proplex 2 vials, labetalol 20mg IV x 1 and admitted to
the neuro-ICU.

His ICU course has been complicated only by Afib with RVR. His
alertness has not changed and he has had no N/V. After speaking

DNR/DNI status.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the neuro-ICU after discovery of a
large intraventricular bleed. His anticoagulation was reversed
and his neurologic status remained stable, with only minimal
development of hydrocephalus. On HD#2, [**Name (NI) 5041**] was considered but
anesthesia felt that there was considerable risk of respiratory
failure with sedation required for the procedure and the family
did not wish to reverse his DNR/DNI status. Hospital course was
complicated by pneumonia and on HD#6, the patient spiked a fever
and went into respiratory distress, with respiratory rate in the
40's. After discussion with the family, the patient was made
CMO, as they felt this was consistent with his wishes. The
patient subsequently expired, with family at the bedside, and
autopsy was declined.
