Chief Complaint:
A Fib with RVR

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is an 81 year old man with multiple medical
problems transferred to ICU for suctioning to protect airway.
He has multiple medical problems, including complicated post-op
course after CABG on [**11-25**], recently discharged to [**Hospital 100**] Rehab,
who presents with increasing lethargy and rising white blood
cell count for further evaluation and workup.  His most recent
admission included MVR/CABG with post-op course complicated by
pneumothorax s/p R CT, respiratory distress, left pleural
effusion s/p thoracentesis, mental status changes, MSSA
pneumonia/bacteremia, tracheostomy/PEG, diarrhea. During that
hospitalization, he completed a course of Flagyl (empiric for C.
diff, ultimately negative), ciprofloxacin (for Enterobacter in
the sputum), and nafcillin (for MSSA pneumonia/bacteremia).  At
rehab, he was being treated for cellulitis/abscess around the
tracheostomy site (with wound dehiscence), as well as for MRSA
in sputum, with vancomycin. His white blood cell count has been
rising, and ID consult at rehab was concerned for mediastinitis.
In addition, he has had a change in mental status since his
recent hospitalization (per his family).

Initial WBC was 22 with 88% neutrophils, no bands.  His CT head
was negative for bleeding but revealed evidence of sinusitis.
His CT torso revealed b/l pleural effusions, L>R, but no
evidence of mediastinitis or fluid collection.  He was on
vancomycin already for MRSA in sputum at rehab, and this was
continued to cover for cellulitis.  Flagyl was added for emperic
coverage Cdiff.  He triggered on the floor twice for Afib with
RVR, which responded to IV nodal agents (15mg dilt and 5mg
metoprolol).  He also was requiring frequent suctioning from his
trach and thus was transferred to MICU for increased nursing
needs.


Past Medical History:
- CAD s/p MV repair/CABG on [**2141-11-24**], complicated post-op
course; post CABG echo demonstrated EF 55%
- S/p trach/PEG
- Hx of MSSA pneumonia/bacteremia
- Diabetes - A1c 7.3 in [**2141-9-2**]. alb/Cr ratio 800 in [**2141-10-2**].

Social History:
Social history is significant for quitting tobacco over 35 years
ago. There is no current alcohol abuse. Worked in a cemetery;
never married; never had kids.


Family History:
Father died of influenza, mother died of old age.  There is no
family history of premature coronary artery disease or sudden
death.

NEURO: Oriented to hospital, [**2142**]


Pertinent Results:
STUDIES:
CT Chest/Abd/Pelvis [**2142-1-5**]: 1. Slight increased overlap of the
osseous structures at the sternotomy site suggests the
posibility of movement. 2. Large left pleural effusion with
complete left lower lobe collapse, which is stable. There may be
a loculated component to the left pleural effusion and there is
suggestion that the effusion may be entirely simple. There is
increased size of a now moderate right pleural effusion. 3. No
fluid collection in the mediastinum surrounding the tracheostomy
site. 4. Dense three-vessel coronary artery calcification and
abdominal atherosclerotic plaque.  5. Stable right
nonobstructing colonic inguinal hernia and new left colonic
inguinal hernia. Neither bowel loop protrudes significantly into
the respective inguinal canals and there is no sign of
obstruction or entrapment. Correlate with clinical exam. 6.
Stable right [**Month/Day/Year **] nodule. 7. Interval development of tiny
stones in the gallbladder.

CT Head [**2142-1-5**]: 1. No acute intracranial abnormality detected.
2. Near-total opacification of the mastoid air cells bilaterally
which has increased since previous study. There is an air-fluid
level within the left maxillary sinus with aerated secretions
which is also noted in study from [**Month (only) **] which may be
consistent with acute sinusitis.

ECHO [**2142-1-8**] - The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left
ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There
is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with mild
hypokinesis of the inferior wall. The remaining segments
contract normally (LVEF = 50-55 %). Right ventricular chamber
size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. A mitral valve annuloplasty ring is present.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is borderline
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction
with good global function. Mild mitral regurgitation. Borderline
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. Bilateral pleural
effusions. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS:
Based on [**2141**] AHA endocarditis prophylaxis recommendations, the
echo findings indicate prophylaxis is NOT recommended. Clinical
decisions regarding the need for prophylaxis should be based on
clinical and echocardiographic data.

[**2142-1-10**] RUQ U/S - The liver is normal in echotexture without
focal lesion identified. There is no intra- or extrahepatic
biliary dilatation with the common bile duct measuring 3 mm. The
gallbladder is not distended and there is no pericholecystic
fluid or wall edema. In comparison to the previous study there
is significantly less sludge. A tiny echogenic shadowing foci in
the dependent portion of the gallbladder could represent a few
crystals.  IMPRESSION: No evidence of acute cholecystitis.
Interval improvement in gall bladder sludge, but not complete
clearing.

Brief Hospital Course:
81yo M with complicated recent hospitalization now with altered
mental status, cellulitis at tracheostomy site, Afib with [**Hospital 26875**]
transferred to ICU for airway protection/suctioning.

THE PATIENTS FAMILY HAS CONSENTED TO DO NOT HOSPITALIZE ORDER.
They feel the patient would not want further interventions.  The
plan is to complete the current course of antibiotics but that
no further interventions should be perfo
