CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Lethargy and fevers as well as ruptured
abdominal aortic aneurysm.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 75 year-old
Venezuelan Spanish speaking male who developed a temperature
of 103 and was seen in the Emergency Department at [**Hospital1 1444**] and diagnosed with
bacteremia, but was found to have a ruptured abdominal aortic
aneurysm two days after admission.  He presented to the
Emergency Room on [**7-3**], complaining of increased
weakness, inability to sleep, decreased appetite and
intermittent fevers.  He also complained of low back pain
that was intermittent and less then approximately two hours
as well as abdominal pain.  He was examined by the Emergency
Room team with a chest x-ray performed to rule out pneumonia,
which was negative for effusions, infiltrates, however, there
was a lesion in the right lower lobe on the lateral view and
a CAT scan was recommended.  He was also given the diagnosis
of pyelonephritis and as he was extremely febrile with a
temperature of 103 and appeared quite lethargic he was
admitted to the Medical Service.

Apparently the patient was seen at [**Hospital 2725**] Hospital on
[**6-27**] with similar symptoms and was also admitted at that
time.  Blood cultures from that hospital admission revealed
beta hemolytic strep in one out of two bottles obtained.  It
is unclear as to how the diagnosis of pyelonephritis was made
other then physical examination as no urinalysis was
performed in the Emergency Room.

The patient was admitted and started on intravenous
antibiotics, which included Levaquin 500 mg q.d.  At the time
of his admission and evaluation in the Emergency Room his
vital signs revealed an elevated temperature, which came down
to 97.4, heart rate 95, blood pressure 120/70 with an O2 sat
of 97%.  His laboratories at the time revealed an elevated
white blood cell count at 18.2, hemoglobin 13.4, hematocrit
41, platelet count 387, sodium 130, potassium 4.2, chloride
91, bicarb 26, BUN 20, creatinine .7.

After the patient was admitted he still began to show signs
of increased abdominal distention as well as flank pain and
showed no signs of improvement with antibiotics.  A CAT scan
with contrast of his chest, abdomen and pelvis was performed
shortly later on that evening at approximately 11:00.  This
revealed a large infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm that
extended approximately from the level of the renal arteries
to approximately 1.5 cm above the bifurcation of the common
iliac arteries.  The maximum diameter was noted to be 7 cm.
There was noted to be high density contrast fluids
surrounding the aorta and extending down into the
retroperitoneum into the pelvis.  Apparently this was called
to the house officer at the time of the [**Location (un) 1131**] ___________
