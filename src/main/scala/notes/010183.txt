Images:
CXR [**2130-8-29**]: IMPRESSION: Low lung volumes are somewhat limited
evaluation, but no evidence for acute process.

CT Abdomen/Pelvis [**2130-8-29**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of acute abdominal process.
2. Right lateral ninth rib sclerotic lesion appears
nonaggressive, but correlate with any history of prior
malignancy or bone scan.
3. Abdominal aortic atherosclerotic disease, with focal celiac
artery
aneurysm.
4. Degenerative change, spinal stenosis, and compression
fracture of T11.

EKG:  V-paced, no ST changes

Brief Hospital Course:
1. Hypotension secondary to hypovolemia secondary to decreased
oral intake in weeks leading up to hospital admission.  The
patient's blood pressure responded very well to IV fluid
resuscitation. No pressors were required after fluid
resuscitation.  Parkinson's disease can be associated with
autonomic insufficiency, but this is unlikely the cause of Mr.
[**Known lastname 17113**] hypotension at this time. Once he became euvolemic, he
demonstrated no orthostatic changes to his blood pressure.
Sepsis was considered, but the patient remained afebrile, vital
signs stable, and no clear infection.  Though the urine culture
on [**2130-8-29**] had 10,000-100,000 colonies of staph aureus and group
B strep, the patient had no urinary complaints suggesting
urinary tract infection.  Echocardiogram was negative for
pericardial effusion and demonstrated good systolic function
with ejection fraction of >55%.  The patient's systolic blood
pressures were stable in 120's on day of discharge.  No HTN
medications were restarted at time of discharge.

2. Acute renal failure secondary to hypovolemia.  The renal
function returned to its baseline (creatinine 1.5) after fluid
resuscitation and resolution of hypotension.  The patient does
have symptoms of prostatism with symptoms of difficulty
urinating and dribbling stream. Post-void residual showed about
100cc of urine retention (done by bladder scan).  Renal
ultrasound showed no hydronephrosis.  Post-obstructive uropathy
was not the cause of the patient's acute renal failure.

3. Asymptomatic bacteruria. No antibiotic therapy initiated.  Pt
to contact his primary care physician if symptoms of fever,
hypotension, dysuria, increased frequency develop.

4. Hyperkalemia secondary to acute renal failure. Supplemental
potassium, spironolactone, and benazepril were held.
Hyperkalemia was not an issue after renal failure resolved.

5. CHF: stable. Carvedilol, Benazepril, Spironolactone, and
Furosemide were held for hypotension.  Reinitiation of
medication to be determined at next visit with PCP that was
suggested for the week following discharge.

6. HTN: all anti-hypertensive medications held for hypotension.

7. Prior CVA: stable

8. Type 2 DM: stable

9. Alzheimer's: stable

10. Gout: stable. Allopurinol held because of acute renal
failure.

11. Parkinsons: stable

12. Code status: DNR/DNI
