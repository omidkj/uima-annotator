History of Present Illness:
This 69 year old female with dilated cardiomyopathy with LVEF
20-25%, moderate mitral regurgitation, moderate tricuspid
regurgitation and moderate aortic stenosis presented for right
and left heart cardiac cath in the setting of prorressively
worsening dyspnea and fatigue. She initially presented in [**Month (only) 116**] of
[**2169**] to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in [**Location (un) 5450**], NH for evalution of her
progressive SOB. The plan was medical treatment at the time and
to have cardiac cath. She did not want to have cardiac cath and
she was lost of follow-up.

Her dyspnea  has progressively worsened over the last few weeks.
She can walk [**Age over 90 **] yards on the flat at her own pace, and up 1
flight of stairs at home, but has to sit down then. She
occasionally gets associated pressure in the upper chest. She
was referred for a right and left side heart cath. Her cardiac
catheterization showed left main disease w/70-80% occlusion, LAD
50% and Circ 99%. Her recent echo also showed dilated left
ventricle with severe global systolic dysfunction, probable
aortic stenosis w/ mild to moderate aortic regurgitation,
moderate to severe mitral regurgitation.

Pertinent Results:
TTE [**2171-11-20**]
LEFT ATRIUM: Moderate LA enlargement. No thrombus in the LAA.
RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: A catheter or pacing wire is
seen in the RA and extending into the RV. No ASD by 2D or color
Doppler.

cavity. Severely depressed LVEF. False LV tendon (normal
variant).
RIGHT VENTRICLE: Mildly dilated RV cavity. Mild global RV free
wall hypokinesis.
AORTA: Focal calcifications in aortic root. Normal ascending
aorta diameter. Normal descending aorta diameter. Simple
atheroma in descending aorta. No thoracic aortic dissection.
AORTIC VALVE: Moderately thickened aortic valve leaflets.

normally. Moderate AS (area 1.0-1.2cm2) Moderate (2+) AR.

valve annuloplasty ring. Mild mitral annular calcification. Torn
mitral chordae. Severe (4+) MR.
TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets. Moderate [2+]

Mild PR.
GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I Conclusions
PRE-CPB:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. No thrombus is seen in
the left atrial appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D
or color Doppler.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF= 20-25
%). The basal inferoseptal wall appears diskinetic. All
mid-papillary segments except for the anterior and anterolateral
segments appear severely hypokinetic. The right ventricular
cavity is mildly dilated with mild global free wall hypokinesis.

There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. No
thoracic aortic dissection is seen. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) are moderately thickened. There is moderate aortic valve
stenosis (valve area 1.0-1.2cm2). Moderate (2+) aortic
regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Torn mitral
chordae are present. The mitral leaflets fail to coapt, leading
to severe (4+) mitral regurgitation. This is likely due to LV
dilation.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
POST-CPB:
A mechanical valve is seen in the aortic position. The valve
appears to be well-seated with normally mobile leaflets. There
are no paravalvular leaks. There is no AI. The peak gradient
across the aortic valve is 27mmHg, the mean gradient is 11mmHg
with CO of 4.7.
A mitral valve annuloplasty ring is present. There is mild
mitral stenosis with mean gradient of 4mmHg across the mitral
valve. The mitral regurgitation is now mild.
The patient is on milrinone, vasopressin, norepinephrine and
epinephrine infusions. The LV systolic function remains severely
depressed, estimated EF=25%. The RV systolic function appears
mildly improved from pre-bypass.
The tricuspid regurgitation remains moderate.




Brief Hospital Course:
Following admission she was diuresed with a Lasix drip at 10-15
mg/min which was then switched to torsemide.  More than 5L were
diuresed with weight loss of about 3 kg.  Her JVD returned to
near normal, breathing much easier, and she was no longer
tachypneic. Additionally she underwent cardiac catheterization
for preoperative evaluation [**11-12**] and was found to have coronary
artery disease, she had no chest pain preoperatively.

She had a dental consult and subsequently had teeth extracted
on[**11-17**] in preparation for valve surgery. She had a right leg
ulcer on her shin from traumatic injury over one month ago.
Dermatology performed a biopsy with cultures growing out
pan-sensitive pseudomonas. The wound does not appear infected
with clean base and edges.  She was treated with cefepime as
recommended by infectious disease for 3 days peri operatively.

Additionally surgery was delayed due to increased creatinine
which peaked at 2.1 on [**1-19**] with BUN 39, the diuretic was held
over the next few days and creatinine decreased to 1.6 on [**11-20**]
and she was taken to the Operating Room.

She underwent aortic valve replacement, mitral valve repair, and
coronary artery bypass graft. See operative report for further
details. She was taken to the intensive care unit on
vasopressin, Milrinone, norepinephrine and Propofol.  She
remained intubated overnight due to hemodynamic instability and
was able to be weaned and extubated on post operative day one.
Additionally her inotropes and pressors were progressively
weaned as tolerated and discontinued on Day 3 with stable
hemodynamics. She went into a rapid atrial fibrillation and
given an Amiodarone bolus and drip on POD#3. She converted to a
sinus rhythm later in the day and was started on low dose beta
blockers.  Hydralazine was started for afterload reduction as
blood pressure tolerated (ACE-I was not started
