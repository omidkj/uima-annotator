CXR [**3-22**]:
IMPRESSION: Persistent opacity in the retrocardiac left lower
lobe has the appearance of atelectasis. Small left-sided pleural
effusion. Stable cardiomegaly.
.
CXr [**3-23**]: In comparison with study of [**3-22**], there is diffuse
perihilar haziness extending out toward the periphery,
consistent with pulmonary vascular congestion. Substantial left
pleural effusion persists, and there has been development of a
right-sided effusion as well.
.
CXR  [**3-26**]: In comparison with earlier study of this date, the
degree of prominence of the pulmonary vessels is substantially
decreased. The right hemidiaphragm is now sharply seen. The
retrocardiac opacification consistent with atelectasis or
effusion is again noted.
.
CXR [**3-29**]: Dense opacity at the left lung base has increased, now
completely obscuring the left hemidiaphragm, consistent with
effusion. Increased opacity in the retrocardiac region is
consistent with atelectasis given increased leftward shift of
the mediastinum. Left-sided [**Month/Year (2) 4448**] is again noted with leads
unchanged. There is a rightward curvature of the upper lumbar
spine representing either scoliosis or positional factors given
recent comparisons do not include this region.
.
Echo: The left atrium is mildly dilated but quite elongated.
There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The
left ventricular cavity size is normal. There is moderate global
left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 25-30 %). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The ascending
aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets are severely
thickened/deformed. No aortic regurgitation is seen. There is
severe aortic stenosis ([**Location (un) 109**] 0.4 cm2). The mitral valve leaflets
are mildly thickened. There is moderate thickening of the mitral
valve chordae. There is a minimally increased gradient
consistent with trivial mitral stenosis due to mitral annular
calcification. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due
to acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may
be significantly UNDERestimated.] The tricuspid valve leaflets
are mildly thickened. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic
pressure is normal. There is no pericardial effusion.
.
Cardiac Cath and Valvuloplasty:
 1. Initial angiography in this left-dominant circulation
revealed the following:Left coronary artery with diffuse
moderate
calcification. LM minimal luminal irregularity. LAD: mid 50-60%
re-stenosis in area of prior ptca site. Otherwise, the LAD had
mild
diffuse luminal irregularity. The LCx and marginals were large
vessels
free of significant disease. The diagonals were normal. The RCA
was
known to be occluded and not injected. It filled via collaterals
from
the left system.
2. Hemodynamics revealed a central aortic pressure
pre-valvuloplasty of
111/69. There was a peak to peak gradient across the aortic
valve of
70mm Hg which improved s/p valvuloplasty to 36mm hg. Fick
Cardiac output
improved from 2.83 to 2.96 post procedure.
3. The aortic valve was crossed with an 035 straight glidewire.
Our
pigtail catheter was inserted into the LV and pressures measured
as
above, confirming critical aortic stenosis. Heparin was used
prophylactically for the procedure. A stiff amplatz wire was
then
exchanged over our pigtail catheter. A 20 mm, 8 french
compatible tyshak
II 6cm balloon was then inflated x 3 total inflations. There was
still a
residual gradient of 45mm hg. Thus, the valve was dilated with a
22 mm,
8 french tyshak ii balloon x 2 total inflations. Final pressure
showed a
reduction in the peak to peak gradient across the aortic valve
to 36mm
Hg. The patient tolerated the procedure well and left the lab
free of
angina and in stable condition.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. One vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Critical aortic stenosis
3. Successful aortic valvuloplasty


Brief Hospital Course:
Pt was admitted with chest pain.  However by admission, chest
pain had resolved with SL nitroglycerin x 2.  Pt had negative
cardiac markers x 3, q8 hours.  No ischemic ECG changes noted.
She was thought to be dry on exam. Lasix and lisinopril were
held. That evening, she developed respiratory distress and was
found to be in acute congestive heart failure. She had severely
labored breathing, extensive rales and pulmonary edema on CXR.
She was also hypoxic. She was transfere
