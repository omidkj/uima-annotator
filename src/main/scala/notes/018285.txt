Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2181**]
Chief Complaint:
Suicide attempt, overdose, NSTEMI

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac catheterization
Intubation
PICC line placement

History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 59 yo woman with PMH severe depression, migraine
has, recent weight loss w/ negative work up who presents from
[**Hospital3 **] today after suicide attempt, c/b NSTEMI.
Patient initially presented to [**Hospital3 **] on [**2108-3-18**] after
overdosing on pills.  She apparently called her grandson stating
that she had taken "45 pills".  On evaluation of her pill
bottles, it appears as though she took Zyprexa and Adderall.
She was found minimally responsive by her husband at 2pm on
[**2108-3-18**] who called EMS.
On arrival at [**Hospital1 **], patient was intubated, given charcoal and
NG lavage, and admitted to ICU for managment.  On admission, pt
was noted to be tachycardic, but vital signs otherwise stable.
Labs were essentially WNL.  Tox screen was negative for benzos,
cocaine, tricyclics, marijuana, opiates, amphetamines, asa,
small amt + of tylenol at 1.7.  Initial EKG demonstrated sinus
tachycardia at [**Street Address(2) 65762**] depressions in V1 and diffuse ST
elevations with PR depressions.  In terms of her overdose,
poison control was contact[**Name (NI) **] and patient was monitered for
neuroleptic malignant syndrome and anticholinergic effects which
was of concern with her Zyprexa overdose, but did not exhibit
any of these signs.  She was otherwise maintained with
supportive care.
Patient was also noted to have Troponin trend from 0.09 night of
admission to 0.03 to 4.5.  EKG on 2nd day of hospitalization
demonstrated ST elevations in lateral leads which were more
pronounced than on admission.  Patient was not placed on heparin
gtt as it was believed that this troponin elevation was more
likely [**2-9**] strain, as patient had had recent cardiac w/u as
outpt that was negative.
Hospital course otherwise notable for some hypoxia with
borderline O2 sats on 100% FiO2- CXR at that time demonstrated
some evidence of aspiration pna and ?CHF.  Pt's WBC also rose to
16.  Patient was therefore started on unasyn for broad spectrum
coverage.  Patient also developed hypotension, thought ?[**2-9**] pna,
and pt was placed transiently on neosynephrine for BP control,
although was off pressors on transfer to [**Hospital1 **].
Patient was therefore transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for managment of her
MI and her pulmonary status.
Currently patient is intubated and sedated.

Past Medical History:
(per OSH records):
1.) Depression
2.) Migraine HA
3.) Chronic pain
4.) 100 lb weight loss over past year - pt has undergone
extensive w/u including colonoscopy, GYN exam, HIV test, cardiac
w/u, stool studies, celiac studies negative.  Also had abd CT
negative, Chest CT demonstrated LUL nodule which was monitered.
Had recent scan that demonstrated increase in size of LUL nodule
from 3mm->7mm, PET scan in [**12-11**] negative - scheduled to have
repeat Chest CT this month.


Social History:
Patient is married, lives w/ husband and 14 [**Name2 (NI) **] grandson.  +
family stress due to death of her son from heroin overdose about
2 years ago.  Also has daughter w/ current substance abuse
problems.  Remote tobacco history.

name, able to squeeze fingers per nurse

Imaging:
[**2108-3-19**] CXR:
IMPRESSION:
1. Left lower lobe pulmonary opacity, likely representing
aspiration.
.
[**2108-3-19**] Cardiac catheterization:
COMMENTS:
1. Selective coronary angiography revealed a right dominant
system with
patent LMCA, LAD that had mild 30% mid vessel lesion, LCx that
was
without obstructive disease and the RCA had a mid vessel 60%
lesion.
2. Left ventriculography was deferred.
3. Hemodynamic assessment showed low normal RAp, elevated PaP
with
marked respiratory variation and normal PCWP. The CI was 2.4.
There was
systemic hypotension with narrow pulse pressure. This was
consistent
with septic shock.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. One vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Normal ventricular function.
.
[**2108-3-20**] ECHO:
Conclusions:
The left atrium is elongated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
are normal.  The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed
(ejection fraction 20-30 percent) secondary to extensive apical
akinesis, with contractile function improving toward the base of
the heart. A left ventricular mass/thrombus cannot be excluded.
There is no ventricular septal defect. The right ventricular
free wall is hypertrophied. The right ventricular cavity is
dilated. Right ventricular systolic function is borderline
normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal
with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The
mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. There is no
mitral valve prolapse. No mass or vegetation is seen on the
mitral valve. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There
is severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.
.
[**2108-3-21**] CXR: IMPRESSION: Interval improvement of pulmonary
edema. Interval improvement of bibasilar opacities, which may
represent residual changes from aspiration.
.
[**2108-3-22**]: CT Chest with Contrast:
IMPRESSION:
1. Bilateral lower lobe consolidation worrisome for multifocal
pneumonia. Given the distribution, aspiration is also a
consideration. Followup after an appropriate clinical interval
post-treatment is recommended to demonstrate complete
resolution.
2. Bilateral pleural effusions, and interlobular septal
thickening that may suggest fluid overload.
3. 3 mm nodule in the right lower lobe. In the absence of known
primary mal
