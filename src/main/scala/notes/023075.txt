Admission Date:  [**2168-10-4**]       Discharge Date:  [**2168-10-11**]


Service:  ACOVE

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a [**Age over 90 **] year-old man
with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,
asbestos exposure and a positive smoking history who presents
with increased shortness of breath, status post bronchoscopy
one day prior to admission. The patient has had a cough for
about one year and has been intermittent, but with copious
sputum production.  He has otherwise had no other systemic
symptoms.  His weight has been stable.  His primary care
physician has placed on cyclic antibiotics over the past six
months with Cipro with improvement in cough, but no change in
the sputum.  He was referred to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 575**] for pulmonary
function tests and a chest CT.  The chest CT revealed a left
hilar mass that was 3.2 by 2.3 cm causing depression of the
bronchus to 2 mm in the transverse diameter as well as left
upper lobe consolidations.  There was also diffuse
lymphadenopathy.  The patient had proceeded to bronchoscopy
on the day prior to admission and biopsies were taken.  He
was found on the day of admission on the ground by his family
and presented to the Emergency Department with fevers of 102,
chills, diaphoresis and shortness of breath that was much
worse then at baseline.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Likely bronchogenic CA as above.  Cytology was negative
at the bronchoscopy.
2.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
3.  Coronary artery disease, although the patient denies
this.
4.  Hypertension.
5.  Hypothyroidism.
6.  Status post gastrointestinal bleed in [**2166**].
7.  Status post lysis of adhesions for an SBO in the past.

ALLERGIES:  Tetracycline.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1.  Singulair 10 q.d.
2.  Norvasc 5 q.d.
3.  Levoxyl .25 q.d.
4.  Aldactone 25 q.d.
5.  [**Doctor First Name **].
6.  Combivent.
7.  Flovent.
8.  Cipro.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is widowed.  He is a retired
electrician with asbestos exposure.  He lives with his son in
[**Name (NI) 5110**].  He has a fifty pack year smoking history.  He
quite several years ago.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Notable for emphysema in his father.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On examination in the Emergency
Department his vital signs were 98.2.  Pulse 100.  Blood
pressure 81/36.  Respiratory rate 40.  Satting at 87% on room
air.  In general he was an elderly man in moderate to severe
respiratory distress with accessory muscle use.  Neck
examination he had pupils that were reactive with a left
greater then right.  Extraocular movements intact.
Oropharynx was dry.  His neck revealed no jugulovenous
distention.  His lung examination was notable for coarse
bilateral rhonchi on exhalation left greater then right with
poor aeration throughout.  Cardiac examination he had normal
S1 and S2, although they were distant.  No murmurs, rubs or
gallops.  His abdomen was soft, nontender, protuberant with
no hepatosplenomegaly.  His extremities had no clubbing,
cyanosis or edema.  He had 2+ pulses.  His neurological
examination was nonfocal.

LABORATORY:  White blood cell count of 18.6, 51 polys, 34
bands, 6 lymphocytes and 8 monocytes.  His hematocrit was
42.2, platelets 329.  His chem 7 was notable for a sodium of
135, potassium 4, chloride 95, bicarb 23, BUN 45, creatinine
2.8 up _________ 1.4, glucose 163.  His lactate was 7.5.
Urinalysis was performed and was negative.  He had a
bronchoalveolar lavage done on the day prior to admission
that was reportedly negative.  Sputum at one point was
positive for heavy Pseudomonas growth.  Chest film was
performed that showed worsening post obstructive collapse
versus pneumonia around the left hilum that was found to be
post obstructive.  His electrocardiogram showed no change
from previous.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  1.  Pneumonia:  The patient was given
vigorous fluid resuscitation in the Emergency Department
given 2 grams of Ceftazidime, 500 Levofloxacin and 500 of
Flagyl as well as stress dose steroid with Solu-Medrol 125.
His blood pressure improved while in the Emergency Department
to 117/56.  He was transferred to the [**Hospital Ward Name 332**] Intensive Care
Unit for further management.  The patient was started on
Ceptaz 1 gram q 24 and Levofloxacin 250 q 48 based on his
renal function.  This was done in order to double cover for
Pseudomonas, which he has been infected in the past.  Over
the next two days the patient's respiratory status improved
significantly and his oxygen requirement dropped notably.  On
the second day of admission he was able to be transferred out
of the unit onto the floor.  While he was on the floor he was
afebrile with a normal blood pressure throughout and he will
need to finish a fourteen day course of Ceftazidime and
Levofloxacin.

2.  Hypotension:  The patient was hypotensive in the
Emergency Department.  This was likely secondary to sepsis
from the pneumonia.  He was given vigorous fluid
resuscitation with normalization of his blood pressure and by
discharge his blood pressures were stable in the 140s to 150
range.  In fact, he will be restarted on his outpatient
medications on Norvasc 2.5 lower then his baseline.

3.  Renal failure:  The patient likely had prerenal azotemia
from his hypotension and hypovolemia.  His urine electrolytes
were suggestive of prerenal azotemia.  His creatinine
improved over the course of his admission down to 1.4, which
was his baseline.  Further evaluation was not undertaken.

4.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease:  The patient has a
history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and per his
primary care physician who knows him well has persistently
wheezed over the last several years.  He was continued on his
steroid and inhalers with a marked improvement in his
clinical examination.  At discharge he was requiring only 2
liters nasal cannula and was satting in the mid 90s with
barely any wheezing.  As he was initial treated with stress
dose steroids these will be weaned off going down by 20 every
two days so on [**10-12**] he should have 20 mg of Prednisone, [**10-13**]
20 mg of Prednisone and then Friday off Prednisone.  When the
oral steroids are stopped he should be restarted with his
Flovent inhaler.

5.  Endocrine:  The patient had hyperglycemia while on the
steroids.  He was treated with a regular insulin sliding
scale.  This can likely be discontinued when his steroids
have been discontinued.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Fair.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  To rehab facility.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Ceftazidime 1 gram intravenously q 24, last dose
[**2168-10-19**].

4.  Protonix 40 po q day.
5.  Synthroid 25 micrograms po q day.
6.  Albuterol and Atrovent nebulizers q 4 hours prn.  These
can be changed to MDIs when the patient is stable to take
them.
7.  Colace 100 po b.i.d.
8.  Senna two tabs po b.i.d.
9.  Insulin sliding scale to be done until the patient is off
steroids.
10.  Artificial tears one to two drops OU prn.
11.  Prednisone 40 mg po q day, should be 20 mg on [**10-12**] and
[**10-13**] and then off on Friday.

13.  Singulair 10 mg po q day.

FOLLOW UP PLANS:  The patient will see Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 952**] of
cardiothoracic surgery on [**2168-10-20**] at 10:00 a.m.  He will
then see Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 575**] on [**2168-10-20**] at 11:30 a.m. for further
