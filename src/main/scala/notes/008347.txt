Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 465**]
Chief Complaint:
  large IPH


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
External ventricular drain placement and removal.
G-tube placement


History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 70 year old man with a h/o prior stroke now
presenting with a large IPH.  The patient is unable to give a
history so details are taken from his medical record.  He was in
his usual state of health until right after dinner, he arose
from
the table and then collapsed to the ground.  He was "out of it"
for about a minute.  When he came to, he was agitated and
confused.  EMS was called and he was taken to Caritas [**Hospital 39167**].  A head CT there revealed a small amount of right
parietal subarachnoid blood.  During his stay there, he also
vomited and was intubated for aspiration protection.  He was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further care.


Past Medical History:
-atrial fibrillation
-CAD s/p CABG
-h/o rectal polyps
-h/o old left parietal stroke
-h/o sleep apnea


Social History:
-lives with wife
-no tobacco or alcohol use


Family History:
unknown

.
CT C-spine [**2115-4-13**]:
1. No evidence of cervical spine fracture.
2. Multilevel degenerative changes. There is intervertebral disc
space narrowing at C6-7, and mild, probably degenerative, grade
I anterolisthesis of C5 on C6.
3. Nasogastric tube is coiled within the supraglottic region.
4. Evidence of pulmonary edema at the lung apices.
5. Left subclavian vascular stent.
.
CT head w/o contrast [**2115-4-13**]:
The epicenter of hemorrhage is probably posterior to the
splenium of the corpus callosum, with extension of hemorrhage
into the lateral ventricles, and right ambient cistern.
Subarachnoid blood is seen within right parietal sulci and there
is a potential subdural component between the cerebral
hemispheres and along the tentorium. Though the epicenter of the
hemorrhage is somewhat unusual, the differential diagnosis
includes hypertensive hemorrhage, hemorrhage related to an AVM,
neoplasm, amyloid angiopathy and idiopathic.
.
pCXR [**2115-4-13**]:
A trauma board obscures detail. An endotracheal tube is in
place, with the tip approximately 7.9 cm from the carina. Of
note, a nasogastric tube is not visualized, and was seen coiled
within the pharynx on the accompanying cervical spine CT. There
are sternotomy wires and mediastinal clips consistent with prior
CABG. The heart may be mildly enlarged. The aorta is calcified.
There are increased interstitial markings within the lungs,
suggesting some degree of pulmonary edema. A pacer pad over the
right hilar region obscures some detail. No definite pleural
effusion or pneumothorax. A stent in the left apical chest is
seen
.
ECG [**2115-4-13**]: Atrial fibrillation. Inferior/lateral ST-T wave
changes. Intraventricular conduction delay. Clinical correlation
is suggested. No previous tracing available for comparison.
.
CT head w/o contrast [**2115-4-14**]:
Again noted a rounded area of hemorrhage located within the
midline posterior to the level of the lateral ventricles,
measuring approximately 4.3 x 3.5 cm on today's study, compared
to 4.5 x 3.4 cm previously, not significantly changed in axial
dimensions. Again seen extension of the hemorrhage into
occipital horns of the lateral ventricles bilaterally. Today it
is also seen within right and left ambient cisterns.
Subarachnoid and subdural components of the hemorrhage are not
changed. There is no shift of normally midline structures.

There has been interval placement of a right ventriculostomy
tube. There is a small focus of air in the right frontal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of
the lateral ventricle, consistent with recent manipulation. An
air-fluid level is seen in the maxillary sinus on the right and
the left. The mastoid air cells are well aerated.
.
CT head w/o contrast [**2115-4-15**]:
No significant interval change in unusual location and
distribution of intracranial hemorrhage. Absent a history of
trauma or anticoagulation, amyloid angiopathy should be
considered, though the deep white matter location and
intraventricular extension would be atypical.
.
pCXR [**2115-4-16**]:
Comparison to prior film from earlier the same day demonstrates
worsening of interstitial and alveolar opacities bilaterally
likely representing edema. New retrocardiac density is likely
also secondary to underlying edema, however, a focal infectious
consolidation cannot be excluded. Small new pleural effusions
may be present bilaterally. Cardiomegaly is again noted and the
remainder of mediastinal contours are unchanged. Midline
sternotomy wires and surgical mediastinal clips are seen.
.
CT head w/o contrast [**2115-4-17**]:
No change from the prior examination with a large
intraparenchymal hemorrhage centered about the splenium of the
corpus callosum. Unchanged amounts of intraventricular and
subarachnoid blood. Encephalomalacia in the region of the left
parietal lobe.
.
pCXR [**2115-4-17**]:
Cardiomediastinal silhouette remains enlarged. There are
sternotomy wires and mediastinal clips in place. There has been
an interval improvement of interstitial and alveolar opacities
bilaterally, likely represented CHF. Previously noted
retrocardiac density has improved as well. There is no sizable
left pleural effusion. Right costophrenic angle is excluded on
this study. The feeding tube is seen coiled in the esophagus.
.
CT head w/o contrast [**2115-4-18**]: No significant short interval
change. The ventricles are unchanged in configuration compared
to one day ago.
.
CXR Pa/L [**2115-4-20**]:
There is a dense alveolar infiltr
