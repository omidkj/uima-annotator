History of Present Illness:
HPI: 44 y/o male who was found by maid at motel 6 slumped over
table breathing at RR 4-5/min. He was brought to OSH given
narcan and regained conciousness. He admitted to taking heroin
and then methadone because he felt unwell. He also admitted to
drinking vodka. Estimated time down is 2 days. At OSH there was
also ? of anterior MI so patient was started on ASA, BBlocker,
heparin. His Hct at the OSH was 51, WBC 29 N76 Bands 16 L 4,
etoh level 2.3 and CPK [**Numeric Identifier 46721**]. Patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]
for more critical care managment. Patient was started on
dopamine at OSH and kept on dopamine intitally in ED then weaned
off. He had a lactate of 4.7 and was also hyperkalemic. He was
given calcium gluconate 3g, 3 amps HCO3, 30g kayexalate, insulin
with dextrose and empirically treated with vanc/levo/flagyl. His
EKG on arrival showed ST elevation and peaked Ts in V2-V4 and
TWI in V6 along with widened QRS. Cards saw EKG and felt that
patient has LBBB and does not have MI, increased enzymes in
setting of rhabdo and renal failure. Also at OSH patient was
noted to have left LE pain. In the ED patient found to be waxing
and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] mental status ABG sent which came back 7.17/74/85,
decision made to intubate patient and pt went to MICU.
.
MICU Course:
When patient admitted to MICU his respiratory acidosis was
quickly corrected by increasing MV on ventilator.  Patient
however still hypoxic and hyperkalemic.  Hypoxia was felt to be
due to pulmonary congestion and hyperkalemia due to renal
failure.  Patient K+ did not improve once acidosis corrected so
patient was started on hemodialysis.  After HD patient hypoxia
improved and he was quickly weaned from the ventilator.  On
day#4 patient was extubated and continued to do well off the
ventilator.  Patient had an echo which showed severe global
hypokinesis with an LVEF 20-25%.  Patient CK continued to trend
down slowly while in the ICU and peaked at 100,000.  While in
the ICU patient noted to have LLE swelling.  He had LENI done
which was negative but his LLE continued to swell and became
tense and painful.  A repeat LENI was done and ortho was
consulted to rule out compartment syndrome.  While patient was
intubated he spiked temps and was started on levo/flagyl/vanco.
His urine and blood culture data was negative, but his sputum
gram stain grew back gram positive cocci and rods.  Patient had
CT scan chest/abd which was negative for source of infection.
After extubation and off propofol patient became very agitated
and seemed to have alcohol withdrawal or DT.  He was put on CIWA
scale and initially required high doses of valium. He was
started on standing Valium in addition to CIWA. His BUN/Cre did
not improve even with dialysis and patient remains anuric.

Operative note [**2103-9-28**]:
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Left leg compartment syndrome,
status post open fasciotomy.

POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Left leg compartment syndrome,
status post open fasciotomy.

PROCEDURES: Irrigation and debridement left leg, second look
with partial closure and reapplication of the VAC dressing.

OPERATIVE INDICATIONS: Mr. [**Name13 (STitle) 4643**] is a 44-year-old gentleman
who developed a compartment syndrome as a result of
compression in the midst of a heroin overdose. I had
released the compartments on [**2103-9-26**]. Please see the
dictated operative note for details of that procedure. This
was a planned second look with further irrigation and
debridement and attempted closure if possible. I discussed
the risks, benefits and alternatives of this procedure with
the patient and he wished to proceed.

OPERATIVE FINDINGS: Entire anterior compartment muscle
necrosis. Viable lateral and deep posterior compartments.

OPERATIVE TECHNIQUE: The patient was taken to the operating
room and placed on the table in the supine position. After
general endotracheal anesthesia was obtained, a small bump
was placed underneath the left hip. The left lower extremity
was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion and a
time-out was performed per protocol. The prior VAC dressings
had been removed prior to prepping the leg. Upon further
inspection, the entire anterior compartment muscle tissue was
necrotic. It was [**Doctor Last Name 352**] in color without any contractility
using the [**Last Name (un) 4161**]. However, the remaining compartments all had
very healthy good viable muscle with the exception of some
small amount of necrosis within the soleus, in the
superficial posterior compartment. After the wounds were
irrigated gently with bulb irrigation, the necrotic tissue
was removed. Again this included the majority of the anterior
compartment musculature. The neurovascular bundle was
identified and a good dopplerable pulse was obtained from the
anterior tibial artery. Similarly, the posterior
neurovascular bundle was also identified and found to provide
a good pulse as well. The wound was then reirrigated again
using gentle bulb irrigation. Attention was then turned to
closure. There was an area of skin overlying the anterior
compartment that was somewhat bruised, likely from a
compression during the evolution of this process. It was
however, still viable and did blanch and refill with
compression. Thus, I was able to perform a partial closure of
the lateral wound from top down and from the bottom up,
leaving only a small area in the center that was left open. 2-
0 nylon stitches were used for this closure. Less of the
closure could be performed for the more medial incision
likely because of the presence of more viable good muscle
tissue. The
