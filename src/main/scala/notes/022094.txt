Chief Complaint:
Chest pain


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
tracheal intubation
arterial cannulation


History of Present Illness:
61yoF with h/o HTN but no other known cardiac disease who
presented to ED with two episodes of chest pain starting
yesterday.
.
History is limited and gathered from her father who states that
for the past 1.5 yrs she has been under a "tremendous" amount of
pressure from her job, such that they call and email her 7 days
a week and she is always under a "great amount of pressure."
Furthermore, her executive director is "very mean" to her. She
has also been very involved in caring for one of her friends who
has cancer and has a lot of anxiety and this has been
burdensome. On the day of presentation, she had a situation at
work that was very upsetting to her, and her father picked her
up at work. She thought she was having an anxiety attack, and
her father notes her face was moist and she was c/o pressure in
the front of her chest radiating to her upper and lower back,
then to her throat. She did not want to go to the hospital
because she felt she was just being emotional. After several
hours, she started feeling better and her dad dropped her off.
Then he was called later becuase the pain returned. She took 1
baby ASA and unclear HTN medication. During second episode, she
reported to the ED that she had vision changes described as
seeing jagged images which has since resolved. +diaphoresis,
-N/V, -abdominal pain.
.
In the ED: she triggered for hr 140s and 99/83. She was
diaphoretic and pale. EKG showed sinus tach 140's with some
concern for anteroseptal MI. She was given Metoprolol 5mg IV and
her hr came down to 100's, however the pain continued, was
worsening, and ? more in her back. There was concern for
dissection, but has an allergy to iodine listed, so unable to
scan with contrast. She then acutely became more hypotensive to
the 50's systolic so Dopamine gtt and Neo gtt were started. She
was noted to vomit copious amounts just before she was intubated
(was difficult intubation) with Etomidate and Succinylcholine
for sats in the 70's. L femoral line, arterial line, OG, and
Foley placed. >2L IVF's were eventually given, then 40 mg IV
Lasix was given for pulmonary edema after repeat CXR. She was
transferred on Dopamine and Levophed, Versed and Fentanyl gtt's.

.
Vitals before transfer: HR 120s, BP 100s/60s.

Brief Hospital Course:
61yoF with no know cardiac history who presented with acute
chest pain and admitted to CCU intubated and hypotense and found
to have acute systolic heart failure consistent with Takotsubo's
stress induced cardiomyopathy. Her course has been complicated
by hypoxia likely due to aspiration pneumonitis and pulmonary
edema from volume resuscitation.
.
Takotsubo's Cardiomyopathy.  Pt had no significant cardiac
history and has been under significant emotional stress.  Echo
on presentation showed apical akinesia with presevation of
basilar portion of LV, consistent with takotsubo's
cardiomyopathy.  CT ruled out aortic dissection and aneurysm.  A
repeat echo on HD2 revealed improvement in systolic function,
but characteristics of takotsubo's still present.  Pt was
started on lovenox bridge to coumadin to anticoagulate for
akinetic LV.  Pt will need anticoagulation for one month.  She
was also started on metoprolol and aspirin.  Her lisinopril was
continued at home dose of 10mg daily.

Cardiogenic shock: In [**Name (NI) **] pt was given several liters of IVF
after being given metoprolol for sinus tachycardia.  Excess
intravascular volume in setting of heart failure caused pt to
decrease sv and become hypotensive requiring intubation and
pressure support.  After starting diuresis in CCU, pt was weaned
off of pressors and subsequently extubated on HD2.  Pt was
euvolemic by hospital day 3 and diuresis was stopped.  On echo
and ekg, there was no evidence of RV strain and no evidence of
historical substrate suggestive of PE.
.
Aspiration pneumonia:  Pt vomited prior to intubation and CT
chest showed evidence of heterogenous consolidations.  Pt was
started on broad spectrum antibiotics and on hospital day two
she was transitioned to levaquin.  She remained afebrile and wbc
treded down from 23K to 7K.  She was discharged with an
additional two days of levaquin to complete a 7 day course of
antibiotic therapy.
.
Hypertension: After pt became hemodynamically stable, she was
restarted on antihypertensive regimen with the following
changes: HCTZ was discontinued and metoprolol succinate 25mg
daily was started.  Pt was continued on her home regimen of
lisinopril 10mg daily.
.
