Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was a 72 yo male with severe COPD, RML, LUL wedge
resection,and neck XRT presented with a 2 history of increased
SOB and cough. He had been on ceftriaxone from [**Date range (1) 90581**] and then
levofloxicin for 10 more days.   The patient was at risk for
resistent organisms and also the risk of aspiration was great
and given neck XRT, impaired ciliary clearnance increases risk
of pseudomonas. On admission the patients ABG is remarkable for
PaCO2 of 90, but with a pH of 7.39; for chronic resp, acidosis,
expect his bicarb to be 39; thus he had a met alk as well.
Patient does not give any history of nausea/emesis(as one might
expect in Theoph toxicity).  The patient had clearly documented
DNR/DNI status at the nursing home and his signed forms were
faxed over. The patient was initally admitted to the medical
intensive care unit.  He was started on vanco and zosyn for
broad coverage and started on methylprednisolone q8 for
management of his COPD flare.  It was unclear if there was a
superimposed PNA.  The ICU team felt that BiPAP was not
indicated as it could serve only be a bridge to intubation and
intubation was against the patient's wishes.  The patient was
maintained on NC and fasemask O2.  He was transferred to the
medical floor there was no further intensive interventions.  He
continued to be tachypnic and require increasing amounts of
oxygent to maintain O2>88%.  He was given morphine for worsening
SOB.  Multiple attempts were made to contact family members, but
none could be reached.  The nursing home reported that the
patient had not had contact with any family member in over 1
year.  The patient expired on [**2172-2-2**] at 4:55PM.  Further
attempts were made to contact family members without success.
No autopsy was performed.
