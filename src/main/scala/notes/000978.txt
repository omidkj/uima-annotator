History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 80837**] is an 82 year old woman who has been followed for
some time for aortic stenosis and mitral regurgitation.  She
recently became symptomatic with a syncopal episode.  She

Her family history is unremarkable.

Physical Exam:
At the time of admission, Ms. [**Known lastname 80837**] was found in no acute
disress.  Her skin exam was unremarkable, as was her head, ears,
eys, nose, and throat examination.  Her neck was supple with
full range of motion.  Her lungs were clear to ausculatation
bilaterally.  Her heart was of regular rate and rhythm and a
grade III/VI systolic ejection mumur was appreciated.  Her
abdomen was soft, non-tender, and non-distended.  No edema or
varicosities were noted.  Her neurological exam was grossly
intact.  Her femoral, dorsal pedis, posterior tibial, and radial
pulses were noted to be 2+ bilaterally.

Findings
LEFT ATRIUM: Mild LA enlargement.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thickness, cavity size, and
global systolic function (LVEF>55%). Suboptimal technical
quality, a focal LV wall motion abnormality cannot be fully
excluded. No resting LVOT gradient.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTA: Normal aortic diameter at the sinus level. Normal aortic
arch diameter.

AORTIC VALVE: Bioprosthetic aortic valve prosthesis (AVR). AVR
leaflets move normally. Normal AVR gradient. Trace AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. Moderate
mitral annular calcification. Mild (1+) MR. [Due to acoustic
shadowing, the severity of MR may be significantly
UNDERestimated.]

TRICUSPID VALVE: Mildly thickened tricuspid valve leaflets. Mild
to moderate [[**1-15**]+] TR. Borderline PA systolic hypertension.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflet.
No PS. Physiologic PR.

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: Bilateral pleural effusions.
Conclusions
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function are normal
(LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall
motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. A bioprosthetic
aortic valve prosthesis is present. The aortic valve prosthesis
leaflets appear to move normally with normal gradient for this
prosthesis. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral
regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.] The
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is
borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Well seated aortic bioprosthesis with normal
gradient, but trace aortic regurgitation. At least mild mitral
regurgitation. Normal biventricular cavity sizes with preserved
global biventricular systolic function.

CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS:
Based on [**2160**] AHA endocarditis prophylaxis recommendations, the
echo findings indicate prophylaxis IS recommended. Clinical
decisions regarding the need for prophylaxis should be based on
clinical and echocardiographic data.

Brief Hospital Course:
  On [**2162-2-12**] Ms.[**Known lastname 80837**] was taken to the operating room and
underwent an aortic valve replacement with a 21mm [**Company 1543**]
Mosiac Ultra Porcine valve and coronary artery bypass grafting
times four (LIMA to LAD, SVG to DIAG, SVG to OM, and SVG to
PDA).Please refer to  Dr[**Last Name (STitle) **] operative report for further
details. She tolerated the procedure well and was transferred in
critical but stable condition to the surgical intensive care
unit. She awoke neurologically intact, pressors were weaned and
she was extubated by post-operative day one. All lines and
drains were removed in a timely fashion. Ms.[**Known lastname 80837**] was
transferred to the surgical step down floor on post-operative
day two. There she was found to be in atrial fibrillation and
was placed on amiodarone.  Due to  hypotension she was
transferred back to the surgical intensive care unit for fluid
status management and tenuous pulmonary status.  POD#6 Chest Ct
scan performed to evaluate tracheal malacia. Scan revealed a
sizeable left pleural effusion. left thoracentesis was done,
which drained 700cc serosanguinous fluid. Anticoagulation was
started with
