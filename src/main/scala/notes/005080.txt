History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 87355**] is a 53F with a history of Down syndrome and
hypothyroidism who presented earlier today to [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] from
her group home with increasing dyspnea, productive cough x 5
days, and vomiting/diarrhea x 1 day (she was incontinent of
stool, which is new for her; stool appeared brown). She lives in
a group home with one other roommate and 24-hour caregivers; her
siblings are also involved.

According to her family, she has been having some mild problems
with her breathing for the last several months (DOE with walking
short distances such as from a parking lot to a store, which was
new). She had seen her PCP and was told that she may have
"sports-induced asthma" but per family it does not sound as
though she has been treated for asthma and the family is not
aware of PFTs or other work up. She has had poor appetite
(making excuses to avoid eating foods she has previously loved)
and has lost visible weight though exact amount is not known.
She was recently started on Zoloft a few weeks ago. She has also
had complaints of chronic gas/bloating and abdominal pain and
was planned for outpatient CT abdomen last week on Thursday. She
took PO contrast at home prior to this study, which caused
diarrhea. The patient became very upset after the diarrhea and
refused to get in the ambulance for transport, so the study was
never performed. She has had diarrhea since that time. Around
the same time, she developed a cough and acutely worsening SOB.
According to family, they were not aware she had been sick until
yesterday, when she had vomiting/diarrhea and worsening SOB.
Today, she was looking more sick so was brought to [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] ED
for evaluation.

At [**Location (un) 620**], Temp: 98.7 HR: 100 BP: 142/114 Resp: 18 O(2)Sat:
97%. Patient was tachypneic and wheezing, improved with BiPap
and nebulizer treatments. She received vancomycin, azithromycin
and ceftriaxone, 2u pRBCs (Hct 20.9), 3L NS, and 125mg IV
solumedrol. CXR showed multifocal PNA v septic emboli and
bedside Echo showed hyperdynamic EF 70% without obvious septal
defects or vegetations. In our ED, initial VS were: 92, RR 19,
114/88, 100% on NRB at 10L. Labs notable for WBC 18.1 (88%N,
2%B), Hct 25.9 (bl 43), Cr 2.5 (down from 2.8, bl 0.9), HCO3 18,
lactate 2.1, ABG 7.35/44.0/198 (at [**Location (un) 620**]). Exam notable for
yellow guaiac positive stools and rhonchorous breath sounds
bilaterally.
.
On arrival to the MICU, patient was anxious and tachypneic,
initially 76-85%RA but improved to 100% on NRB. When her sister
was asked to leave the room, she became more anxious and was
briefly noted to have cyanotic mucous membranes and RR to 40;
she calmed down when sister returned and sats responded promptly
to oxygen.

Past Medical History:
Down Syndrome (trisomy 21)
Hypothyroidism
Chronic flatulence/abdominal pain
? Asthma - increased wheeze/DOE x 1 month, felt to be
exercise-induced asthma
