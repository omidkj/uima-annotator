History of Present Illness:
CHIEF COMPLAINT: Chest pain
.
EVENTS / HISTORY OF PRESENTING ILLNESS: [**Age over 90 **] year old male with
CAD (s/p CABG and multiple stents to the venous grafts),
hypertension, type II diabetes, and chronic renal insufficency
who presented with suddent onset chest pain and respiratory
distress starting at 6a.m. on day of admission. The patient felt
this was the same type of pain as his past myocardial
infarction. The patient did not have nausea or vomiting.
.
In the ED, vital signs were as follows: HR-108-120, BP:
128-254/100-164, RR: 32, O2sat: 93-100% on CPAP at 5cm H20. On
exam, patient was diaphoretic with cool extremities, there was
JVD, bibasilar rales, and bilateral pedal edema. EKG showed ST
elevations in aVR and V1-V3. Cardiac enzymes showed a CPK of
125, MB-8, and Trop T 0.21. The patient was given morphine,
Aspirin 325mg, metoprolol, Plavix 600mg, integrillin, heparin
drip, nitro drip, Lasix 40mg. The patient continued to have
respiratory distress an arterial blood gas showed a ph of 7.15,
pC02 of 54, and a pO2 of 74 and was therefore intubated with an
8.0 ETT with ventilator settings of Assist control mode with a
respiratory rate of 12, tidal volume of 550ml, and PEEP of 7.5,
and FiO2 of 100% and an NG tube was placed. He was then brought
urgently to the catheterization lab.
On review of symptoms, he was intubated/sedated and unable to
obtain history.

Pertinent Results:
EKG ([**2103-7-21**]): Sinus Tachycardia with a rate of 117bpm. Nml PR
and QRS intervals. Mildly prolonged QT interval. Nml axis. LVH.
ST elevations in aVR, V1-V3. ST depressions in I, II, aVF,
V5-V6. T wave inversions in I, and aVL. Compared to prior EKG:
Sinus Tachycardia, worsening of ST elevation in aVR and V1-V3.
Though, in the past, minimal ST elevations were present in those
leads.
.
CXR ([**2103-7-21**]): The cardiac silhouette size remains borderline
enlarged but stable. Extensive degenerative changes are noted
throughout the thoracic spine.  There is mild cardiogenic
hydrostatic edema with small bilateral pleural effusions.
.
CARDIAC CATHETERIZATION ([**2103-7-21**])SVG-RCS with 40% stenosis.
SVG-OM with previous stent occluded and thrombus. SVG-OM
thrombectomy with balloon angioplasty (22atms)resulting in
normal flow. LVEDP 25. Right renal artery with no critical
lesions. Left renal artery with mild ostial disease.
.
ECHO ([**2103-7-21**]): Dilated LV with LVEF depressed (20%) Inferior
akinesis/hypokinesis, anterior hypokinesis, septal
akinesis/hypokinesis, and apical akinesis/dyskinesis. Nml RV
size with depressed RV funcion. No AS. No pericardial
effusion/tamponade.
.
ECHO ([**2103-7-23**]):  Mild LA enlargement.  Mild symmetric LVH with
normal cavity size.  There is mild hypokinesis of the distal
septum and distal inferior wall.  Left ventricular ejection
fraction of 30-35%.  Mild RA dilation.  Normal RV chamber size
and mild RV hypokinesis.  Trace AR, ([**1-2**]+) MR, (1+) TR.
Compared to study on [**2103-7-21**], there is improvement in LV
function.

Brief Hospital Course:
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN, AS REVIEWED AND DISCUSSED IN MULTI
DISCIPLINARY ROUNDS : Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a [**Age over 90 **] year old man with a
history of CAD (s/p CABG and mult. stent placements), type II
diabetes, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia who presented with
chest pain and shortness of breath and found to have an ST
elevation myocardial infarction based on EKG and cardiac
enzymes.  Status post cardiac catheterization with thrombectomy
and balloon angioplasty of the SBG-OM graft.
.
CAD/STEMI:  Patient is s/p cardiac cath with thrombectomy and
balloon angioplasty of the SBG-OM graft.  Cardiac enzymes were
cycled with a peak CPK of 773 and a peak CK-MB of 95.  The fact
that the patient had thrombosis of a bare metal stent in the
SBG-OM graft while on a home dose aspirin and Plavix is
concerning for some sort of hypercoagulable state.  The patient
was therefore started on Plavix 75mg PO BID.  The patient was
continued on aspirin 325 mg daily, contin
