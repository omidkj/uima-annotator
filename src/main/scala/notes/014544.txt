History of Present Illness:
82 [**Last Name (un) **] with PMH of HTN who presents as a transfer from [**Hospital **]
hospital for evaluation for CABG in setting of NSTEMI.
Per family she developed URI symptoms early in [**Month (only) **] which
lasted for several days but resolved.  However, she did not feel
"well" for rest of the month, and noted to have cough symptoms
return 3 days PTA which worsened to the point where she called
EMTs yesterday after developing SOB, and was brought to [**Location (un) **]
where she had CXR which was significant for pneumonia.
Treatment with IV levoquin initiated.  She was intubated in the
ED for resp distress and unresponsiveness. Of note there was
also a question of CHF complicating her picture, and pt noted to
have refractory hypotension requiring initiation of dopamine
during admission.  Cardiac enzymes were followed and  noted that
tropI was trending up to >100 and CK MB of 73.3 with EKG with
lateral ST depressions.  She was plavix loaded, given ASA, and
started on heparin ggt.  She was taken to cath where she was
found to have 90% ostial lesion 90% LAD occlusion, and 80%
distal RCA with a widely patent LIMA visualized for bypass.
During the procedure, she was noted to be hypotensive with SBPs
of 50s and in cardiogenic shock.  Balloon pump was placed at
this time.
She has been transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for evaluation of CABG for her
critical 2VD.  On transfer, she is on dopamine ggt at
20mcg/kg/min, fentanyl at 50mcg/hr, versed at 5mg/hr, and
heparin ggt at 1200 u/ hr.

ECHO [**12-22**]:
The left atrium is normal in size. The left atrium is elongated.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left
ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There
is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
anterior hypokinesis. The remaining segments appear to contract
normally, though images are suboptimal (LVEF = 40%). The right
ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with normal free wall
contractility. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened
(?#). The study is inadequate to exclude significant aortic
valve stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is mild
functional mitral stenosis (mean gradient 5 mmHg) due to mitral
annular calcification. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
[Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation
may be significantly UNDERestimated.] There is moderate
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
effusion. There is an anterior space which most likely
represents a prominent fat pad.
IMPRESSION: Mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction,
c/w CAD. Cannot exclude hemodynamically-significant aortic
stenosis. Moderate pulmonary hypertension.

ECHO [**12-24**]:
The left atrium is normal in size. Regional left ventricular
wall motion is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is normal (LVEF>55%). There is no ventricular septal
defect. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened.
There is mild aortic valve stenosis (valve area 1.2-1.9cm2).
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Normal global and regional biventricular systolic
function. Calcific aortic valve disease with mild stenosis/mild
regurgbitation. Mild mitral regurgitation. Mild pulmonary
hypertension.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2193-12-22**],
anterior hypokinesis is no longer appreciated (prior study
technically-suboptimal).

Echo [**12-30**]:
 Conclusions
No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of
the left atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of the right
atrium/right atrial appendage. Right atrial appendage ejection
velocity is good (>20 cm/s). No atrial septal defect is seen by
2D or color Doppler. Overall left ventricular systolic function
is normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free
wall motion are normal. There are simple atheroma in the
descending thoracic aorta. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are
mildly thickened. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Preserved biventricular global systolic function.
Mild mitral regurgitation. Mild aortic regurgitation.
Mild-moderate tricuspid regurgitation.

FINDINGS: The examination is markedly limited by patient body
habitus and
inability to position as well as bandage material. There is no
gross evidence of intra- or extra-hepatic biliary dilation. The
common hepatic duct measures 4 mm. The portal vein is patent
with flow in the appropriate direction. The gal
