Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Compazine / Codeine / Atenolol

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 898**]
Chief Complaint:
10 days of chest pain and lower extremity swelling

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 58 y.o. male withh h/o PE, s/p IVC filter,
malignant hypertension, hepatitis B and C and multiple
psychiatric diagnoses who initially presented to [**Hospital1 18**] with a
chief complaint of pleuritic chest pain for 10 days.  He
described the pain as burning, in his heart, radiating across
the precoridum to the right shoulder, non-exertional, but
associated with occasional shortness of breath. He did not
report nausea, vomiting or diaphoresis. He had also noted the
onset of bilateral lower extremity edema at this time.  He did
not report recent immobilization or long plane rides, car rides
or recent surgeries.  He was taking his coumadin but he did not
know his dose and had not had his INR checked recently. He
presented to his PCP solely for medication refills.  Per the
patient his PCP checked and ECG and then referred him to the
emergency room. On review of systems 2 weeks of diarrhea, no
abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting.

Presented to his PCP only to get his meds refilled, not b/c of
these symptoms. Apparently Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3357**] took EKG and something
looked off so he referred patient to ED.

Pertinent Results:
ECHO [**4-2**]: 1. The left atrium is mildly dilated. 2. Left
ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular
cavity size is normal. Regional left ventricular wall motion is
normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF>55%). 3. Right ventricular chamber size is normal. Right
ventricular systolic function is normal. 4.The aortic valve
leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion. No aortic regurgitation is seen. 5.The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. No mitral regurgitation is seen.
6.There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. 7.There
is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. Compared with the
findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2106-3-24**], no
change.
.
NON-CONTRAST HEAD CT SCAN [**4-2**]: There is no evidence of acute
intracranial hemorrhage or shift of the normally midline
structures. The ventricles and cisterns are normal. There is
hypodensity within the right frontal periventricular white
matter, consistent with chronic microvascular ischemia. There
may be a small lacunar infarction within the white matter
adjacent to the right caudate head, also unchanged. Otherwise,
the density values of the brain parenchyma are normal, with
preservation of the [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter differentiation. The
visualized paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are clear.
Osseous and soft tissue structures are unremarkable.
.
LENI: No evidence of deep vein thrombosis.
.
ESOPHAGRAM:
1. Esophageal dysmotility.
2. Likely aspiration after the swallow suggested by a small
amount of contrast seen within the vocal cords and upper airway
after the swallow, corresponding to the patient's coughing. If
further evaluation is required, a modified barium swallow/video
oropharyngeal swallowing study might be of additional use.
3. Small hiatus hernia

Admission CT of chest ([**2106-3-22**]:
IMPRESSION:

1. Filling defects in segmental branches of the left lower lobe
pulmonary arterial system, new compared to the previous study,
consistent with pulmonary embolism. This was relayed to the
emergency board dashboard and flagged for urgent attention, and
discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].

2. Interval improvement in several subtle areas of ground-glass
opacity seen in the previous study with multiple areas of
atelectasis on the current study.

3. IVC Filter is satisfactory position.


Brief Hospital Course:
A/P 58 y.o. male with malignant hypertension, hep B, hep C, PE,
s/p IVC filter placement presents with chest pain leg swelling
and found to have pulmonary embolus while subtherapeutic on
coumadin.
*
Pulmonary Embolus:
The patient was found to have a left lower lobe pulmonary
embolus which was new compared to his previous study. His IVC
was found to be in a satifactory position. We thought that this
was probably secondary to poor compliance with his coumadin
since his INR on admission was 1.1 and he could not recall his
dose of coumadin and he had not had his INR checked recently. Of
note his INR on admission was 1.1 and the patient did not know
his dose of coumadin and had not had his INR
