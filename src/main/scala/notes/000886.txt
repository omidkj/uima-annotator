ADMISSION DIAGNOSES:
1.  Coronary artery disease.
2.  Aortic stenosis.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Coronary artery disease.
2.  Aortic stenosis.
3.  Status post coronary artery bypass graft times one with
saphenous vein graft and left radial artery composite, atrial
valve replacement with 19 mm [**Last Name (un) 3843**]-[**Known firstname **] valve.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 80-year-old
man with known coronary artery disease.  He reports having
shortness of breath with exertion since [**2148**], but this has
gotten worse over the past month.  He states that he has
dyspnea after climbing one flight of stairs, with carrying
ten pound trash barrels.  He denies any chest pain.  He
denies claudication, orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea,
edema or lightheadedness.  The patient is now referred for
cardiac catheterization.  A previous cardiac catheterization
had shown a 70% apical LAD lesion, 90% circumflex lesion with
a subtotally occluding OM2, a 40-80% proximal RCA lesion and
a 60% MRCA lesion.  The patient had stenting of the OM1,
distal circumflex/OM3 and PTCA of the small OM2.
Persantine/Myoview in [**2150-7-26**] was negative for angina
and an uninterpretable EKG.  Negative for perfusion defects
with a calculated ejection fraction of 50-55%.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Peripheral vascular disease.
2.  Nonhealing left foot ulcer.
3.  Nephrolithiasis.
4.  Small bowel obstruction.
5.  Left superficial femoral artery to posterior tibial
bypass [**2149-4-1**].
6.  Vein patch angioplasty of bypass [**2150-8-13**].
7.  Laparoscopic cholecystectomy [**2145**].

MEDICATIONS:
1.  Accupril 10 mg q. day.
2.  Lopressor 25 mg b.i.d.
3.  Glucophage 1000 mg b.i.d.
4.  Aspirin 325 mg q. day.
5.  Insulin NPH 52 units q. a.m., 22 units q. p.m.
6.  Insulin regular 8 units q. a.m.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient is an elderly gentleman in
no acute distress.  Vital signs are stable, afebrile.  HEENT
is atraumatic, normocephalic.  Extraocular movements intact.
Pupils equal, round and reactive to light.  Anicteric.
Throat is clear.  Neck is supple, midline with no masses or
lymphadenopathy.  Chest is clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Cardiovascular is regular rate and rhythm without murmur, rub
or gallop.  Abdomen is soft, non-tender, non-distended
without mass or organomegaly.  Extremities are warm,
noncyanotic, nonedematous.  There are venous stasis changes
in the legs.  The patient also has scars consistent with his
left SFA to PT bypass grafts.  Neuro is grossly intact.

LABS ON ADMISSION:  CBC:  9.4/12.2/35.9/159.  Chemistries:
142/4.6/104/27/22/0.9.  INR 1.1.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted for cardiac
catheterization which revealed calculated ejection fraction
of approximately 50% and normal wall motion.  Findings showed
codominant coronary artery system with severe two vessel
coronary artery disease and severe aortic valve stenosis.
There was also found to be biventricular diastolic
dysfunction and moderate pulmonary hypertension.  The patient
was recommended for urgent revascularization surgery.

On [**2151-1-5**], the patient was taken to the Operating
Room for coronary artery bypass graft times one with
composite saphenous vein graft of the left radial artery to
the left posterior descending artery, he also had aortic
valve replacement performed with a 19 mm pericardial
[**Last Name (un) 3843**]-[**Known firstname **] valve.  The patient tolerated the
procedure well with no complications.  On postoperative day
zero, the patient was transfused two units of packed red
blood cells for an hematocrit of 21.7 in the CSRU.  The
patient was also noted to have increased chest tube outputs
for which he was given protamine, four units packed red blood
cells and two units of platelets.  The patient remained
intubated and had very thick secretions which were frequently
suctioned.  The patient was extubated on postoperative day
one, but reintubated subsequent to difficulty with
respiration.  The patient was again extubated on
postoperative day two and seemed to tolerate this well.
Levophed and dobutamine were both weaned off.  On
postoperative day four, the patient was transferred to the
floor without further complication.  He was noted to be quite
edematous and his remaining hospital course essentially dealt
with his diuresis.  He was initially found to be poorly
responsive to Lasix and his Lasix dose was increased to 8 mg
b.i.d.  He remained unresponsive to this with only slightly
negative I&O balance.  Chest x-ray showed the patient was
moderately wet and a bedside echocardiogram revealed that
there was a high transaortic gradient but no wall motion
abnormalities.  Mild mitral regurgitation was also detected
at that time.  Lasix was increased to 120 mg b.i.d. on
postoperative day seven and a formal echocardiogram was
performed.  Formal echocardiogram again showed a high
transaortic gradient as well as very mild global hypokinesis
of the left ventricle.  No focal wall motion abnormalities.
Aggressive diuresis was continued at 120 mg of Lasix p.o.
b.i.d.  The patient responded to this well and had
improvement in his clinical symptoms of extremity edema as
well as wheezing.  The patient continued to work with
physical therapy and was ultimately discharged on
postoperative day nine tolerating a regular diet, adequate
pain control on p.o. pain medications and showing improvement
in his clinical symptoms of volume overload.  The patient had
no further anginal symptoms during his hospital stay or at
the time of discharge.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON DISCHARGE:  General:  No acute
distress.  Vital signs are stable, afebrile.  Chest clear to
auscultation bilaterally.  Cardiovascular is regular rate and
rhythm with a 2/6 systolic ejection murmur.  The patient's
abdomen is soft, non-tender, non-distended.  The patient does
have 1+ peripheral edema.  There is no sternal click or
sternal discharge.  There is mild serosanguinous drainage
from the right lower extremity saphenous vein graft wound.
There is only minimal erythema.

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  Good.

DISPOSITION:  To home.

DIET:  Cardiac and diabetic.

MEDICATIONS:
1.  Lopressor 50 mg b.i.d.
2.  Lasix 120 mg b.i.d. times ten days.
3.  Keflex 500 mg b.i.d. times ten days (renal dose).
4.  Potassium chloride 20 mEq b.i.d. times ten days.
5.  Colace 100 mg b.i.d.
6.  Aspirin 325 mg q. day.
7.  Glucophage 500 mg b.i.d.
8.  Percocet 5/325 one to two q. 4h. p.r.n.
9.  Amiodarone 400 mg b.i.d.
10. Isosorbide mononitrate 60 mg q. day.
11. NPH insulin 15 units q. a.m. and 10 units q. p.m.

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:  The patient is to continue elevating
his legs at rest and ambulating and incentive spirometry.  He
is to follow up with Cardiology in one to two weeks' time and
address the need for continued diuresis as well as adjustment
of cardiac medications at that time.  The patient should
follow up in four weeks with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
