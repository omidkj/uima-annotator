HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 61-year-old gentleman
with a history of shortness of breath which has increased
over the past several days prior to his admission.

He has known history of coronary artery disease and a prior
percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty.  He is also
noted to have congestive heart failure on his initial
evaluation at [**Hospital6 3872**] and elevated troponin

occluded left anterior descending proximal to his prior left
anterior descending stent, a 90 percent obtuse marginal
lesion, and an 80 percent proximal posterior descending
artery lesion.  Ventriculography was not performed as the
patient had depressed left ventricular function.  The patient
was transferred to [**Hospital1 69**] for
coronary artery bypass grafting.

tibial pulse on the right.  No palpable dorsalis pedis pulse
on the right.  He had a 2 plus posterior tibial pulse on the
right.

PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION:  Preoperative
laboratories revealed white blood cell count was 6.3,
hematocrit was 31.1, and platelet count was 159,000.  PT was
16.5, PTT was 37.4, and INR was 1.7.  He had hematuria
present in his urine, but otherwise had a negative
urinalysis.  Sodium was 118, potassium was 3.2, chloride was
89, bicarbonate was 23, anion gap was 9, blood urea nitrogen
was 16, creatinine was 1, and blood glucose was 705.  Calcium
was 7.5, alkaline phosphatase was 33.6, magnesium was 1.8.
Hemoglobin A1C was 7.4 percent.

RADIOLOGY:  A preoperative chest x-ray showed cardiomegaly
and small bilateral pleural effusions.

A preoperative electrocardiogram showed a sinus rhythm at 66
with first-degree atrioventricular block and a question of
left ventricular hypertrophy.  Please refer to the EKG report
dated [**2136-11-29**].

SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was referred to Dr.
[**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **] [**Initial (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 70**].  On [**11-30**], he underwent coronary
artery bypass grafting times three with a left internal
mammary artery to the left anterior descending, a vein graft
to the posterior descending artery, sequence to the obtuse
marginal.  He was transferred to the Cardiothoracic Intensive
Care Unit in stable condition on a Neo-Synephrine drip at 0.3
mcg/kg per minute and a titrated propofol drip.

On postoperative day one, he was A paced for bradycardia
overnight.  He began Lasix diuresis.  He was hemodynamically
stable.  His blood pressure was 108/47.  He was on an insulin
drip at 3 units per hour and begun on aspirin therapy.

Postoperative laboratories were as follows.  White blood cell
count was 10.5, hematocrit was 26.6, and platelet count was
158,000.  Potassium was 3.9, blood urea nitrogen was 17,
creatinine was 0.8, with a blood sugar of 75.

He remained in the Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit.  He
was receiving morphine and Percocet for pain.  He was
extubated successfully.  He had some stridor overnight, for
which he received a cool nebulizer.  Lasix diuresis was
begun.

On postoperative day two, his pacer was turned off.
Lopressor beta blockade was given.  His white blood cell
count rose slightly to 12.6.  His creatinine was stable at 1.
He was off all drips.  His examination was unremarkable.  The
incisions were clean, dry, and intact.  The chest tubes were
discontinued.  He was evaluated by Case Management.  On
postoperative day two, he again had some stridor overnight
and was given some steroids in addition to the cool
nebulizers.  His Foley was discontinued.

On [**12-3**], he was transferred out to the floor to begin
working with Physical Therapy and the nurses to increase his
activity level.  He was encouraged to continue to ambulate
and to use his incentive spirometer.  He was also seen by the
[**Last Name (un) **] Service in consultation for management of his blood
sugars, and these recommendations were appreciated by the
Cardiac Surgery team.  He also had a full evaluation by
Physical Therapy, and he was doing extremely well with his
postoperative ambulation.

His Lopressor was increased to 25 mg twice daily on
postoperative day four.  He was also started again on his
statin therapy and restarted on Plavix.  His examination was
unremarkable.  He cleared a level V on postoperative day five
and was deemed safe to be discharged home with VNA services.

Discharge laboratories were as follows.  White blood cell
count was 11.3, hematocrit was 28.2, and platelet count was
234,000.  Sodium was 136, potassium was 4, chloride was 108,
bicarbonate was 27, blood urea nitrogen was 34, creatinine
was 1, and blood glucose was 94.  He was alert and oriented
with a nonfocal examination.  The lungs were clear
bilaterally.  His heart was regular in rate and rhythm.  His
incisions were clean, dry, and intact.  He had positive bowel
sounds.  He had 1 plus peripheral edema in his legs.
