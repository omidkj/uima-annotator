Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1838**]
Chief Complaint:
Intracranial hemorrhage transferred for OSH

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
PEG tube.


History of Present Illness:
81 year-old man with a history of atrial fibrillation and aortic
valve replacement on warfarin, stroke in [**2173**], seizure disorder
(two generalized tonic-clonic seizures in life, last in [**2184**]),
who presents as a transfer from [**Hospital **] Hospital for
evaluation
of a left basal ganglionic hemorrhage.

The patient was  in his usual state of health until this
morning,
when his wife noted that he fell forward and to the right while
bending over at the edge of the bed to put his socks on.  She
did
not witness any head trauma, but cannot exclude the possibility
either.  She states that he was weakly walking thereafter, and
she felt that she had to accompany him as he walked downstairs.
In the kitchen, he urinated on the floor, though he did not seem
to realize that this had occurred.  Concerned, his wife drove
him
to [**Name (NI) **] hospital for further evaluation and management.

At [**Hospital1 **], his laboratory evaluation was notable for a
platelet count of 147 and an INR of 1.96.  Urinalysis was
negative and EKG revealed sinus bradycardia, RBBB, and left
ventricular hypertrophy, all of which were apparently noted on
prior EKG.  CXR showed no acute abnormalities.  However,
non-contrast CT of the head revealed a left basal ganglionic
hemorrhage with 4 mm of shift and intraventricular spread.  The
patient was given 10 mg Vitamin K (5 mg IV and 5 mg IM), 2 units
of FFP, 5 mg Norvasc, 5 mg of Lopressor x 2, and a 1 gram load
of
Dilantin.  He was transferred to [**Hospital3 **] for further
evaluation; his wife noted that he has become more somnolent and
dysarthric since arrival.

Review of Systems:
He denies headache, fevers, nausea, vomiting, chest pain,
dyspnea, focal weakness, numbness, and tingling.  His wife notes
that he has been declining since the year began, and that there
is occasional evidence of mild confusion (she cannot cite
specific evidence, and only states that he is "not with the
program" at times.


Past Medical History:
-Aortic valve replacement and reported atrial fibrillation on
warfarin
-Stroke in [**2173**], presented with left arm numbness, no residual
deficits according to wife
-Seizure disorder: Had two seizures in life.  The first occurred
while he was an infant and the second was a generalized
convulsive seizure in [**2184**] in the setting of Paxil use and
alcohol consumption.  He remained seizure free for 2 years and
Dilantin was discontinued without further recurrence in [**2187-1-1**].
-Coronary artery disease s/p CABG in [**2183**]
-Multiple abdominal aortic aneurysms s/p repair in [**2184-12-1**]
-Hospitalized with urinary tract infection in [**Month (only) 958**]
-Orthostatic hypotension
-Bradycardia (baseline heart rate ~50 bpm according to his wife)
-Depression
-Remote spinal surgery nearly 45 years ago
-Dyslipidemia
-BPH


Social History:
He is retired ([**2170**]) from a clerical job with the state.  He had
a long history of tobacco use, but quit in [**2173**].  No reported
alcohol or drug use.


Family History:
A granddaughter and cousin have seizures, otherwise no known
neurologic history

Physical Exam:
Vitals: T 97.7 F  BP 142/55   P 47-52  RR 16    SaO2 97 4LNC
General: elderly man, appears restless in bed
HEENT: NC/AT, sclerae anicteric, MMM, no exudates in oropharynx
Neck: spondylotic, no nuchal rigidity, no bruits
Lungs: poor effort with decreased breath sounds
CV: bradycardic, regular rhythm, systolic murmur noted
Abdomen:  softly distended, non-tender, bowel sounds present
Ext: warm, no edema, pedal pulses appreciated
Skin: no rashes

Neurologic Examination:
Mental Status:
Somnolent, but arousable and opens eye to calling his name
("[**Doctor First Name 12239**]"), tends to keep eyes closed.  He is oriented to person
only and inattentive.  His speech is hypophonic and dysarthric,
difficult to understand.  Many of his answers are not
appropriate
to the question posed.  He appears to pay less attention to the
right side of space, though it is difficult to ascertain whether
this represents neglect given somnolence.

Cranial Nerves:
Fundoscopy was technically limited; blinks to threat
bilaterally.
Pupils equally round and reactive to light, 3 to 2 mm
bilaterally.
Extraocular movements intact, to left and right on horizontal
gaze, but limited on vertical gaze.  No nystagmus.  He reports
facial sensation intact to light touch bilaterally.  Right upper
motor neuron pattern facial weakness is noted.  Hearing: Turns
to
examiner on calling his name.  Palate elevates midline.  Tongue
protrudes midline, no fasciculations.  Would not comply to test
CN trapezius or SCM strength.

Sensorimotor:
Normal bulk throughout with evidence of paratonia bilaterally.
Right pronator drift.  No tremor.

He withdraws to noxious less briskly in the right arm and leg
than on the left side.

Reflexes:
Did not relax appropriately for adequate assessment, though
right
toe upgoing and left toe downgoing.

Coordination: Unable to follow commands to perform FNF or HKS.

Gait: Deferred, given that the patient was taken for urgent head
imaging.

Brief Hospital Course:
81 year-old man with a history of atrial fibrillation and aortic
valve replacement on warfarin, stroke in [**2173**], seizure disorder
(two generalized tonic-clonic seizures in life, last in [**2184**]),
who presents with left basal ganglionic hemorrhage.

He was admitted to the ICU overnight for observation. His exam
and vital signs remained stable.  Repeat head CT the following
AM showed movement of blood from the foramen to the 3rd
ventricle with no increased blood.  Plan is for MRI with and
without contrast to evaluate for possibility of an underlying
mass and MRA head and neck to exclude vascular malformation.
This can be done when he's better able to cooperate and hold
still.  Neurosurgery consulted in the ED and will follow.
Routine laboratory evaluations, including cardiac enzymes, LFTs,
toxicologies, and urine studies were wnl.  All anti-coagulant
and anti-platelet therapy were held. SubQ heparin was started
48hr after his intracerebral hemorrhage.  Goal systolic blood
pressure 120-160 was maintained without intervention after
nicardipine drip for 2 hours overnight.

Code is DNR/DNI.

He received a PEG on 06 17 09 without complications. His
anticoagulation will be held given his bleed in the brain. Will
resume antiplatelets (aspirin 81 qd) on [**7-25**].

Please, give Jevity 1.2 tonight and change to Fiber-source HN 15
ml/hr; Advance rate by 10 ml q4h Goal rate: 65 ml/hr tomorrow.


Medications on Admission:
-Warfarin: 5 mg on MWThF, 2.5 mg on SuTuesSa.  INR on [**6-13**] was
1.6, on [**6-20**] was 2.2, and on [**7-2**] was also 2.2.  He forgot
to
take his warfarin dose yesterday.
