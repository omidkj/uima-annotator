abdominal hysterectomy and oophorectomy for endometrial cancer
with postoperative radiation therapy. She subsequently developed
hepatic metastases and some
thickness in her posterior bladder wall on CT scan. The liver
metastases were confirmed by biopsy.

urine along with pneumaturia. She presented to [**Hospital **] [**Hospital **]

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 26825**] was admitted to the GYN onc service under the care of
Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 1022**].  Given a presumed colovaginal fistula, a general
surgery consult was obtained for evaluation of surgical
management.  Given the course of her cancer, it was felt that
any procedure would be palliative in nature.  A  Urology consult
was also obtained and agreed that the colovaginal fistula should
not be repaired but the patient's symptoms would be best managed
with a diverting colostomy.

On HD#3, Ms. [**Known lastname 26825**] was taken to the OR by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for a
diverting loop colostomy.  She tolerated the procedure well,
please see Dr.[**Name (NI) 6218**] Operative Note for detail.  She was
transferred to the Purple Surgery service under the care of Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **].

On POD#3, some erythema was noted around the stoma site.  The
stoma was pink and patent.  She was started on Keflex for
empiric coverage for a presumed wound infection.  By POD #4, Ms.
[**Known lastname 26825**] had stool and liquid output from her [**Known lastname 9341**]; the erythema
was signifcantly less than the day before.  Over the next 24
hours, however, Ms. [**Known lastname 26825**] was noted to have high [**Known lastname 9341**] output.
She was checked for C. Difficile on POD #5, but these results
were negative.

By POD #6, Ms. [**Known lastname 26825**] felt well and was discharged home with
services.
