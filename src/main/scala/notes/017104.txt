Brief Hospital Course:
Mr [**Known lastname **] was admitted to the Trauma SICU his BP was kept
strictly less than 140, he was started on Dilantin, repeat CTs
should stable extensive parafalcine hemorrhage, hemorrhage
within the right sylvian fissure and along the superior aspect
of the tentorium. Additionally, intraparenchymal hemorrhages
within the right temporal lobe , left frontal lobe and along the
anterior aspect of the right frontal lobe are all unchanged. No
new areas of intracranial hemorrhage identified. The subgaleal
hematoma in the left parieto-occipital region and soft tissue
thickening in the left frontal region are also stable. The
ventricles are stable in appearance, without shift of normally
midline structures.   He was given large amount of Ativan for
evidence of alcohol withdrawl.  He would open his eyes mumble of
few words, move his left side spontaneously but not his right
side.  He had a CTA to rule out anuersym source for blood for
which was negative.

He was moved out of the ICU on [**5-7**] where he seemed to be
improving neurologically, moving left side more awake, regarding
examiner.  The morning of [**5-8**] he found to unresponsive. He was
quickly transferred to the ICU where he had respiratory distress
and need to be intubated.  A repeat CT was unchanged, he had an
MRI that was suboptimal but no strokes seen except possible flow
void in midbrain.  An EEG was done which showed encephalopathy.
He was treated for Zosyn for Vanco for presumed aspiration
pneumonia.  On [**5-12**] he appeared to herniate his brainstem for no
apparent reason.  His CT showed no new bleeds or changes.  A
