History of Present Illness:
67M with history of metastatic renal cell cancer presented
to an outside hospital [**2145-11-28**] with BRBPR.  He was
anticoagulated with coumadin for a mechanical valve and his INR
was 3.9, his hematocrit on admission was 24.  He was transfused
roughly 2 units pRBC, 4U FFP and given vitamin K.  He underwent
an upper endoscopy [**2145-11-30**] which demonstrated gastritis,
duodenitis and an actively bleeding duodenal ulcer which was
clipped.  He was discharged home on [**2145-12-2**] and returned on
the same day with abdominal pain and bright red blood per
rectum.
He underwent another EGD [**12-3**] which did not show evidence of
bleeding, but he did undergo a colonoscopy which demonstrated a
splenic flexure mass which is hypervascular, consistent with a
hypernephroma.  His hematocrit on discharge to [**Hospital1 18**] is 27.4.
He
is transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.

***HEPARIN DEPENDENT ANTIBODIES-PND

Brief Hospital Course:
67 y/o male admitted from OSH with recent GI bleeding.
Outpatient scope and reports were reviewed and an abdominal CT
was showing:
- Invasion into the hepatic flexure colonic wall by a tumor
closely associated with and possibly arising from the large
segment V-VI hepatic mass.
Colonic wall thickening from the cecum to the proximal
transverse colon, proximal and distal to this mass.
- Increase in size of multiple perihepatic masses adjacent to
the inferior
aspect of the liver in comparison to the prior study.
Due to concern for thrombus risk in his prosthetic aortic heart
valve, heparin was started and then bridged back to coumadin
when it appeared he was not having large amounts of bleeding.
He was receiving blood transfusions almost daily to maintain his
hematocrit 26-30%
Sutent 50 mg was started on [**12-11**], which was the dosage
recommended by his Oncologist Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 76148**].  His records had been
reviewed by oncology at this institution and it was determined
that this was the most appropriate medication given the type of
tumor although there was a risk for bleeding.
On [**12-16**] he was ordered for bowel prep to attempt a colonoscopy
on [**12-17**] and on the morning of [**12-17**] he had multiple large
volume bowel movements that were very bloody. He was transfused
4 units pRBCs on [**12-17**] units on [**12-18**], FFP and platelets x 1.
His Hct was as low as 9.4% and was restabilized at 30%.
On the evening of [**12-17**] an arteriogram was performed. Please see
the report for details. He had Coil and Gelfoam embolization of
the 3rd to 4th order inferior branch off the replaced right
hepatic artery resulting in occlusion of one of the
arteries supplying hepatic/hepatic flexure mass.
Following the procedure his hematocrit has remained 28-33%. He
received an additional 2 units on [**12-22**]. Bowel movements since
the time of the procedure have been brown with no evidence of
bleeding.
His coumadin was only held on the 11th and he has otherwise
received 8 mg daily with goal INR 1.5-2 (has aortic valve).
Platelet count trended down over the past few days since [**12-17**]
when he was 196. Platelet count decreased to 69-79 range.
He was started on methadone for pain management as he was
requiring frequent dosing of dilaudid. Dilaudid usage has
decreased.
All other home medications were maintained.

He is going home today on coumadin 8mg daily and sutent 50mg
daily. He will get daily cbc and inr with results called to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 76149**] office [**Telephone/Fax (1) 19102**] (fax [**Telephone/Fax (1) 76150**]).

At time of discharge, vital signs were stable. He was ambulatory
and tolerating a regular diet.
