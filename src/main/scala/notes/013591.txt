History of Present Illness:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 42950**] is a 66 y/o F with hx CAD (s/p CABG with
LIMA-->LAD, SVG-->DM1 in [**2150**]; DES to mid-proximal RCA [**2154**]; and
BMS to proximal LCx [**2156**]), dHF, DM, HPL, Stage III CKD who
presented to OSH with CP, cough, and SOB.  She reports that over
the last two weeks she has had increasing SOB with minimal
activity, weight gain, cough and fleeting CP relieved with SL
Nitro.  She was treated prior to presentation for a PNA with 7
days of clarithromycin.  At baseline, she is minimally active
requiring assistance with cleaning the house and grocery
shopping.  Per her daughter, she never full bounced back from
the CABG in [**2150**].  Prior to admission on [**8-3**] she reports that
she was shaking and felt feverish and shaky, she checked her
temperature and it was 99.6.  She also had increasing left-sided
sharp CP that radiated down her left arm, she took SL Nitro x 3
but had continued CP and was taken to the OSH by her daughter.

At the OSH, vitals were 98.6, 78, 136/62, 22, 96%RA.  EKG showed
NSR 72BPM LBBB unchanged from prior EKG.  CXR showed
cardiomegaly but was otherwise clear.  She had a leukocytosis to
18.7-->10.8 which was attributed to acute gout.  Glucose 243,
BNP was 2443-->3229, Cr 1.5-->2.1 (baseline 1.3-1.5), TnT and CK
were negative, no CK-MB reported.  She was treated with ASA,
Nitroglycerin paste and SL Nitro, continued on [**Month/Year (2) **] and
Bumex.  Patient reports she is down 9lbs since presenting to
OSH.  On the morning prior to transfer TNT <0.01 and CKMB 9,
Index 4.  Around 6pm [**8-4**] she had sudden onset [**9-2**] CP and
diaphoresis.  She was started on a Nitro gtt and transferred to
[**Hospital1 18**] for further management.

Vitals on transfer were T98.1 BP94/47 RR16 HR65 O297%

On arrival to the floor, patient was comfortable, in NAD,
speaking in full sentences and had no c/o.

2-D ECHOCARDIOGRAM [**2161-8-5**]:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is top
normal/borderline dilated. Due to suboptimal technical quality,
focal wall motion is difficult to assess but there appears to be
apical akinesis, marked inferolateral hypokinesis, and moderate
hypokinesis of the remaining walls. A left ventricular thrombus
cannot be excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic function
is severely depressed (LVEF= 25-30 %). Tissue Doppler imaging
suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure
(PCWP>18mmHg). The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened
(?#). There is mild aortic valve stenosis (valve area
1.2-1.9cm2). No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is
seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral
regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.] There is
severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.

([**8-5**]) [**Month/Year (2) **]:
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel native coronary artery disease.
2. Known occluded SVG-D1 and patent LIMA-LAD.
3. Successful PTCA and stenting of the Cx with a DES.
4. Successful PTCA and stenting of OM1 with a DES.
5. Mild systolic heart failure.
6. Elevated pulmonary capillary wedge and right ventricular
filling
pressures.
7. Pulmonary hypertension.
.
([**8-5**]) CXR:
IMPRESSION:  Severe cardiomegaly, in particular dilatation of
the pulmonary arteries are longstanding.  Pulmonary edema is
mild.  There is no appreciable pleural effusion.
.
([**8-14**]) CXR:
Again, the heart is grossly enlarged.  The left pleural effusion

likely is stable. Right lung appears grossly clear.  Bilateral
pulmonary
opacities are consistent with pulmonary edema which is slightly
improved since the prior study.  The patient is status post
median sternotomy.

Brief Hospital Course:
66 y/o F with hx CAD (s/p CABG with LIMA-->LAD, SVG-->DM1 in
[**2150**]; DES to mid-proximal RCA [**2154**]; and BMS to proximal LCx
[**2156**]), DM, HPL, Stage III CKD who presented to OSH with CP,
cough, and SOB, likely [**12-25**] unstable angina now with elevated TnT
and CK-MB without EKG changes which is c/w NSTEMI.  Likely that
she was having UA prior to presentation to OSH and her event
occurred around 10pm on [**8-4**] prior to transfer to [**Hospital1 18**].
.
# NSTEMI:  Initially at OSH patient did not have troponin or
CK-MB leak, but in setting of acutely worsening CP prior to
transfer requiring Nitro gtt and then found to have
significantly elevated CM with no EKG changes, she has likely
suffered a NSTEMI.  She was taken for cardiac catheterization,
which showed occluded LAD (old), 90% proximal instent restenosis
of Lcx, 70% mid Lcx stenosis, 50% mid RCA in prior stent, and
patent LIMA to LAD.  Successful PTCA and stenting of the Cx with
a DES and succssful PTCA and stenting of OM1 with a DES. After
the cardiac catheterization, she continued to complain of less
intense chest pain.  She was medically optimized with the
following medications: ASA 81, Prasugrel 10 mg , Atorva 80,
Metop 12.5mg [**Hospital1 **]. Post [**Hospital1 **] chest pain would improve after
starting ranolazine 500mg [**Hospital1 **]. In subsequent days, the patient's
functional status and ches
