Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 56 year old gentleman with DM Type I and a history of
3 vessel coronary disease (seen in [**2114**] cath.), ischemic
cardiomyopathy (EF of 25 % on echo this admission), aortic
stenosis ([**Location (un) 109**] 0.9 cm), PVD s/p b/l AKA, s/p renal transplant
(baseline Cr 1.2 to 1.4) who was admitted for hypotension and
nausea.  PTA he had been in heart failure clinic on [**9-14**] where
SBP noted to be in 200's; his hydralazine dose was doubled and
his lasix dose increased.  On presentation to ED SBP noted to be
60's pulse in 60s. Also Given INsulin/D50, Kayexalate, Ca for K
of 6.1. Started on dopa, central line placed. Given
vanc/levo/flagyl/hydrocort, 1 am Nabicarb.  Pt admitted to MICU,
intubated.  Started on 2 pressors for blood pressure support
with gentle IVF.  Per cardiology service recommendations, a
Swan-Ganz catheter was placed to help determine etiology of
hypotension.  Initial Swan numbers revealed elevated PCWP of 23,
PAP of 63/23, CVP 9, and SVR of 1300 consistent with cardiogenic
shock and L ventricular overload.  Echo peformed on [**9-22**]
revealed no significant changes from prior with EF of 25%,
degree of AV stenosis was essentially unchanged.  Pt weaned off
pressors and began lasix diuretic therapy for CHF exacerbation.
His estimated PCWP has trended down since then with creatinine
today 1.8 down from 2.2.  Serial chest x-rays revealed resolving
pulmonary edema.

Pt also being followed by renal service for elevated creatinine
and for his status post renal transplant in [**2105**].  The patients
creatinine was elevated on admission but slowly trended back to
normal range by discharge.  He was maintained on his
immunosuppressive therapy of azathioprine, prednisone, and
cyclosporine.  Per his nephrologist Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **], his cyclosporine
levels were adequate.  There was some concern for rejection on a
renal ultrasound but the patient's creatinine had returned to
his baseline

Pt was extubated [**9-30**].  Pt is now off pressors with stable
blood pressure, breathing normally on room air.  Swan Ganz
catheter d/c'd [**2119-10-2**].  Last readings were PAP of 54/21 CVP
of 7.  He was transferred to the floor.  His stay was relatively
uneventful.  His blood pressure was generally stable (SBPs in
100-110 range).  His blood sugars were noted to trend downward
and was found to be 31 in morning of [**10-6**].  This resolved with
[**12-18**] Amp of D50 (to 131); his insulin sliding scale was converted
from regular to humalog; his NPH dosing was adjusted to 10 units
in the morning and 5 units at bedtime.  Pt was also noted to
have a hematocrit  that had trended down from 28 to 25 over the
prior week.  Per renal service, this was felt to be secondary to
his renal disease and his Epogen was therefore doubled in
dosing; in addition, the patient received one unit of blood
before his discharge; blood was given with Lasix.

In summary, this is a 56 year-old type I diabetic male with 3
vessel CAD, ischemic cardiomyopathy with EF 25%, aortic
stenosis, s/p b/l AKA,  admitted for hypotension after increases
in blood pressure medication and admitted to MICU for
hypotension, intubated for respiratory distress.  Found to be in
cardiogenic shock necessitating pressor support and in CHF.  Now
off pressors, blood pressure w.n.l. breathing on room air with
no sign of volume overload on physical exam. Infectious workup
has been unrevealing.

Issues and pal
1) Cardiovascular
.
Perfusion: Three vessel disease not amenable to PCI, not
candidate for CABG
-continue aspirin and plavix
-continue lipitor (40)
-started smaller dose of beta blocker (metoprolol 12.5)
.
Pump:  EF 25%, aortic stenosis ([**Location (un) 109**] 0.9), CHF seems to be class
II.  Status post cardiogenic shock--now resolved, appears
secondary to increase in his blood pressure medications.
-continue lasix at 40 mg PO BID
-continue digoxin at 0.0625 mg every other day, check digoxin
levels regularly
-avoid lisinopril given renal disease
-continue hydralazine at 25 mg PO TID
-please restart isordil and uptitrate as his pressure tolerates.
-will follow up with [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] of [**Hospital1 **]
Outpatient Heart Failure service.
Rhythm: NSR occasional PVCs
-low EF, pt may benefit from ICD placement; per attending Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **], patient has declined this option understanding that he
remains at increased risk of SCD.
.
PVD: s/p b/l amputations
-continue aspirin and plavix
-will need physical therapy from extended hospital stay
.
2) Renal disease, s/p transplant, creatinine now at baseline
-continue azathioprine, cyclosporine, please have nephrologist
follow this patient.  Dr.[**Name (NI) 4849**] is his primary nephrologist.
-CSA levels to be checked regularly
-if creatinine levels rise, please check renal ultrasound
-renally dose all medications
.
3) Anemia.  Status post 1 pRBC transfusion prior to discharge
-have increased epogen from 4000 to 8000 qMWF
-monitor hct
-if pt needs further transfusion, please give Lasix (40 mg IV)
before and after transfusion to prevent volume overload.
.
4) Diabetes, (type I)
-In setting of renal insufficiency and renal transplant will
need to be on Humalog Sliding Scale.  Also should continue NPH
10 units qAM, 5 units qPM.
.
5) FEN: Diabetic/cardiac healthy; please continue sodium and
fluid restriction.
.
6)Prophylaxis should include Hep SC, PPI
.
7) Code: Full
.
8) Disposition:  Was seen by physical therapy who recommended
rehabilitation.  Patient is being discharged to [**Hospital **]
[**Hospital **] Hospital.
