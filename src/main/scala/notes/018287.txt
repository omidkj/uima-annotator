Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1674**]
Chief Complaint:
hyperglycemia, PE

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none


History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 77yoM with HTN, hypercholesteremia, pancreatic
cancer (s/p bypass) and renal cell carcinoma who was sent in by
his visiting nurse [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] BS into the 400's over the past
few days. In mid-[**Month (only) 958**] he was started on steroid to help
increase his appetite. He did not check blood sugars but
approximately 2 weeks ago he developed chills and shakes and was
brought to the [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 392**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] where he was found to have a pneumonia
and [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] blood sugar. He was treated with antibiotics but no
intervention was done for his blood sugars. Since being
discharged his family has been checking his BS and they have
been [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] and his metformin was increased from 500 [**Hospital1 **] to
850 mg [**Hospital1 **] with 425mg prn by his oncologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] at [**Hospital1 2025**].
However, he continued to have [**Hospital1 **] BS and was noted to be
more tired with decreased PO intake and dehyration. He was also
sleeping 80% of the time over the last 2 weeks. Last evening his
sugar was in the 500s and this a.m. he was seen by his VNA who
recommended evaluation.

In the ED vitals were 98.8, 75, 150/64, 14, 100% RA. FS 330 and
given 6units SQ insulin and 1L NS. Urine and blood cultures
sent. Received levofloxacin 750 mg IV x 1. EKG with TWI in
inferiolateral leads and cardiac enzymes were sent. The patient
also related some increasing SOB today as well as intermittent
chest discomfort over the past few days, and a CTA was performed
which showed a large pulmonary embolism. Bedside ECHO done by
the ED attending showed some evidence of right heart strain per
the ED resident, but no documentation of this. He was started on
heparin and tranferred to the ICU for monitoring.

Currently the patient has left flank discomfort but no chest
pain or pleuritic pain. Not SOB. + abdominal pain and tenderness
that is chronic for pancreatic cancer. Decreased appetite. No
fevers, chills, nausea, emesis, dysuria, or other symptoms.

Went to [**Hospital1 2025**] for 2nd opinion who agreed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
Admission in [**2-3**] for nausea/emesis and found to have
gastric/small bowel obstruction and underwent surgery (specifics
unclear as history is from son) to relieve obstruction.  Had
Gtube for some time but no longer.

Pertinent Results:
[**2175-4-18**] CTA CHEST:
IMPRESSION:
1. Massive pulmonary embolism with pulmonary emboli noted within
the main, right and left pulmonary artery and their subsegmental
branches. This is associated with the straightening of the
ventricular septum, which suggests increased right heart
pressure.
2. Diffuse panlobular emphysema of both lungs with multiple
bulla.
3. Massive ascites.
4. Enhancing lesion in the liver dome is new compared to prior
abdominal CT and is concerning for metastasis.

Lower ext u/s:[**Doctor Last Name **]-scale and Doppler son[**Name (NI) 1417**] of bilateral
common femoral, superficial femoral, and popliteal veins were
performed. There is non- occlusive thrombus formation in the
left deep femoral vein with flow detected around the thrombus.
The remaining vessels are patent. In the right lower extremity,
there is non-occlusive thrombus formation in the superficial
femoral vein. The remaining vessels are patent.
IMPRESSION: Bilateral non-occlusive DVT.

ECHO:
The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. Left
ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global systolic
function are normal (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical
quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully
excluded. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus
level. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets
are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial
mitral regurgitation is seen. The left ventricular inflow
pattern suggests impaired relaxation. There is borderline
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a small
pericardial effusion located posterior to the basal
inferolateral segment of the left ventricle. There is a small
amount of fluid anterior to the right ventricle also. There are
no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.

IMPRESSION: Small pericardial effusion located posterior to the
inferolateral wall with some fluid also anterior to the right
ventricle. No echo signs of tamponade. Normal global
biventricular systolic

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient is a 77 y.o.m. with HTN, hypercholesteremia,
pancreatic cancer, renal cell cancer and recent pneumonia who
presents with hyperglycemia and was found to have a pulmonary
embolism.

# Pulmonary embolism ?????? The patient's major risk factor is most
likely malignancy.  Given malignancy, large PE, pt was treated
with Lovenox.  While awaiting assurance of coverage for long
term lovenox by his insurance, he was started on coumadin, in
the case that the Lovenox was rejected.  He received 2 days of
coumadin and had a heightened response to INR 5.3 after only 2
doses of coumadin.  When insurance accepted Lovenox treatment,
plan was to discharge on Lovenox [**Hospital1 **], given his supratherapuetic
INR, visting nurses agreed to check his INR at home over then
next 3 days and to start Lovenox only once INR below 3.0.
LENI U/S showed b/l femoral vein thrombus. No IVC filter was
pursued, this was discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], his primary
oncologist.
ECHO showed small pericardial effusions but no tamponade and no
evidence of right heart strain from the PE.

# Hyperglycemia- The was likely in the setting of recent
infection, steroids, worsening pancreatic function.  He was on
Lantus while in the ICU with good response.  Given the family's
wish to avoid insulin if possible, he was trialed on higher
doses of metformin with good effect.  Visiting nurses w
