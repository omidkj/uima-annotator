CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Transferred for PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 1064**].

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  A 36-year-old woman with a
history of hypertension, depression presented to [**Hospital3 9683**] with a five day history of shortness of breath and
sputum production on [**12-16**].  Chest x-ray demonstrated
bilateral interstitial infiltrates, and bronchoscopy
performed on [**12-23**] was positive for PCP.  [**Name10 (NameIs) **] began treatment
with Bactrim and steroids.

Hospital course at the outside hospital was complicated by
renal failure.  Creatinine increased to 2.4.  Mental status
changes.  Eventually on [**12-22**], the patient was diagnosed with
HIV.

Towards the end of [**Month (only) 1096**], the patient developed
progressive hypoxia with oxygenation of 90-92% on 100%
nonrebreather with change in mental status.  Negative head
MRI and CT scan.  Just prior to time of transfer, the patient
was intubated for progressive hypoxia.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Hypertension.
2. Depression.
3. New HIV/AIDS, diagnosed with CD4 count of 82 as described
in history of present illness.

HOME MEDICATIONS:
1. Zoloft.
2. Advil.
3. Aldomet.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  [**Name (NI) **] mother living outside of the
country.  [**Name (NI) **] father and stepmother involved in her car
locally.

VITAL SIGNS:  Temperature 98.0, blood pressure 160/109, heart
rate 108-131, respirator AC tidal volume 700 x12
breaths/minute and 100% FIO2 with a PEEP of 5.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  In general, intubated, sedated.
Cardiovascular:  Tachycardic, S1, S2.  Pulmonary:  Clear to
auscultation, laterally scant crackles bilaterally at the
bases.  Abdomen:  Normoactive bowel sounds, soft, nontender,
nondistended.  Lower extremities:  No edema.

LABORATORY VALUES:  Sodium 128, potassium 4.9, chloride 97,
bicarb 19, BUN 17, creatinine 1.5, glucose 151, white count
12.9, hematocrit 34.8, platelets of 273.  LFTs within normal
limits with an albumin which was less than 1.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. ID:  The patient with a new diagnosis of HIV with
presenting illness of PCP.  [**Name10 (NameIs) **] was continued on Bactrim
and steroids.  Dapsone was given initially, but discontinued.
Eventually, the patient was started on pentamidine for
further treatment.  Open lung biopsy was considered, however,
given her known diagnosis and tenuous state, the decision was
to not proceed.

HAART therapy was considered, however, not initiated
secondary to concerns of worsening of her condition from
reactivating her immune system.

2. Renal:  Renal biopsy performed at the outside hospital was
consistent with HIV nephropathy.  Her renal function improved
while hospitalized.  Initially, however, eventually declined
secondary to hypotension.

3. Cardiovascular:  Patient developed hypotension felt
secondary to sepsis requiring fluid and eventually maximum
pressure support.

4. Pancytopenia:  The patient underwent bone marrow biopsy
which was suggestive of an early myelodysplastic syndrome
versus changes associated with HIV/AIDS.

5. Endocrine:  The patient was maintained on insulin drip as
well as hydrocortisone and Florinef for sluggish [**Last Name (un) 104**] stym
results.

6. Fluids, electrolytes, and nutrition:  The patient was
maintained on total parenteral nutrition.

7. Neurologic:  The patient required high doses of propofol,
Versed, and Fentanyl to maintain sedation over her
hospitalization course.

8. Pulmonary:  The patient's hypoxia continued to worsen and
despite maximum ventilatory support, she was unable to remain
oxygenated.  The patient developed some air leak and given
the combination of PCP and air leak as well as her overall
poor condition, and poor prognosis, the decision was made to
move to DNI/DNR care.

On [**2161-1-21**], Ms. [**Known lastname 47156**] developed refractory hypotension
despite max doses of levo and Neo-Synephrine, which then
developed into bradycardia, and hypoxia, and asystolic
arrest.

She passed away at 1:09 pm.  Her family was notified of her
critical condition when her blood pressure dropped and
notified of her demise upon arrival to the hospital.  They
did agree to a postmortem examination.
