Service:  [**Last Name (un) **]


HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 63 year old
Creole speaking African American male with a history of
hypertension, chronic renal insufficiency, who originally was
admitted via the Emergency Department at [**Hospital6 **] on [**2129-4-13**], with epigastric pain originally thought
to be secondary to myocardial infarction.  He was immediately
started on Heparin and subsequently had a hematocrit drop
from 33.0 to 12.0.  CT scan performed at that facility showed
a large liver mass and hematoma adjacent to that.  This was
presumed to be the cause of the bleed. He was then
transferred to [**Hospital1 69**] for
further evaluation.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Hypertension.

Asthma.

Noninsulin dependent diabetes mellitus.

Chronic renal insufficiency.

Sleep apnea.

Diverticulosis.

Avascular necrosis.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  The patient is status post hip
operation of unknown type.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1. Theophylline unknown dose.
2. Lasix unknown dose.
3. Nifedipine unknown dose.
4. Clonidine patch unknown dose.
5. Flovent unknown dose.
6. Albuterol unknown dose.
7. Protonix unknown disease.
8. Glyburide unknown dose.


ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient denies any tobacco or alcohol
use.  He lives with his wife and works as a laborer at one of
the local care groups.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On presentation, temperature maximum
was 98.6, pulse 110, blood pressure 139/74, respiratory rate
18, oxygen saturation 98 percent on two liters.  In general,
the patient is described as a moderately obese African
American male in no acute distress.  He is awake, alert and
oriented times three.  Head examination - The pupils are
equal, round and reactive to light and accommodation
bilaterally.  Sclera nonicteric.  Cranial nerves II through
XII are grossly intact.  There is no evidence of any
lymphadenopathy in the anterior posterior lymph node chains.
[**Last Name (un) 55489**] node is likewise noted to be noninflamed and
nontender.  Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Cardiac examination shows regular rate and rhythm.  The
abdomen is noted to be moderately distended with some diffuse
tenderness.  Extremities are warm and well perfused with no
evidence of any edema or swelling.

LABORATORY DATA:  On presentation to the [**Hospital1 346**] are sodium 141, potassium 5.3,
chloride 108, CO2 20, blood urea nitrogen 28, creatinine 3.5,
glucose 160.  Hematocrit at outside hospital was 12.6 and
hematocrit at [**Hospital1 69**] was 32.2.
Prothrombin time is 13.1 and partial thromboplastin time 26.0
with INR of 1.0.

RADIOLOGY:  CT scan performed at [**Hospital3 **] shows a large
abdominal hemorrhage and a perihepatic hematoma.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  On [**2129-4-14**], the patient was taken to the
operating room and underwent exploratory laparotomy,
evacuation of abdominal hematoma, liver biopsy and ligation
of common hepatic artery and replaced left hepatic artery.
The procedure was said to have been well tolerated although
fluid requirements were noted to be six units of packed red
blood cells, two units of platelets and two units of fresh
frozen plasma.  Blood loss was estimated at 6000cc.  The
patient was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit still
intubated but stable.

Soon after surgery, a renal consultation was requested and
this confirmed chronic renal insufficiency with hemodialysis
not considered to be necessary at that time.  Renal
ultrasound performed showed no obstructive lesions or
abnormalities in the kidneys  During postoperative day number
two, blood product requirements remained extremely large
including nine units of packed red blood cells, multiple
units of fresh frozen plasma and platelets.  On postoperative
day number two, Swan-Ganz catheter was placed.  Soon after
this, controlling hypertension became the main challenge with
this patient delaying his extubation.  Ultimately,
hypertension would necessitate Nitroglycerin, Lopressor,
Hydralazine, Clonidine and an ace inhibitor.  On
postoperative day number two, the patient was started on TPN.
On postoperative day number three through six, unit care was
further complicated by the development of a pneumonia
confirmed by x-ray.  Cultures of the sputum showed
pansensitive Klebsiella and the patient was started on
Levofloxacin originally 500 mg p.o. once daily and ultimately
titrated down to 250 mg p.o. once daily given renal
insufficiency.  By postoperative day number eight, blood
pressure was finally controlled with a Nipride drip and the
patient was successfully extubated.

On postoperative day number nine, Dicarbine had been weaned
off and the patient was transferred out of the Intensive Care
Unit to the floor.  On the floor, the patient's TPN was
gradually weaned off.  His diet was then advanced from sips
to clear and on to a regular diet.  On postoperative day
number ten, examination of the patient's surgical wound
showed a small area of drainage at the apex of the wound.
Four surgical staples were removed and the area was packed
with a dry gauze sponge.  No large amounts of purulent
material or wound breakdown were ever found.  On
postoperative day number ten and eleven, the patient was
evaluated by physical therapy team.  The patient's
conditioning was good up to the time and it was felt that the
patient was a good candidate for acute rehabilitation
following discharge from the [**Hospital1 188**].  On postoperative day number eleven after evaluation
by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] and the rest of the surgical team, it was
deemed that the patient was fit for discharge to
rehabilitation.

While final pathology was not available at the time of this
dictation, preliminary pathology and operative findings were
consistent with unresectable primary hepatocellular
carcinoma.  These findings and the prognosis were shared with
the patient and his family.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:  Hepatocellular carcinoma unresectable.

Status post laparotomy and liver resection.

Hypertension.

Asthma.

Noninsulin dependent diabetes mellitus.

Chronic renal insufficiency.

Sleep apnea.

Diverticulosis.

Avascular necrosis.

FOLLOW UP:  The patient should follow-up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] in
two to three weeks to have his staples removed and wound
check.  The transplant coordinating nurse will contact him at
rehabilitation to set this up.

Physical therapy as directed.

The abdominal wound should be repacked twice a day with dry
gauze.
