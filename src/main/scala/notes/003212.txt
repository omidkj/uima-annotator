Brief Hospital Course:
Just prior to admission, patient underwent hemodialysis. He was
then directly admitted to floor, then to the CSRU for Swan
placement and evaluation of pressures and volume status. He was
subsequently started on a Nitro drip for pulmonary hypertension.
He remained hemodynamically stable. The following day, he
underwent a MV repair with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], and was transferred to
CSRU in stable condition on epinephrine, milrinone, insulin, and
propofol drips. He awoke neurologically intact and was extubated
on POD#2. He continued on his regular dialysis schedule. His
inotropic support was gradually weaned over several days. An
echocardiogram on POD#4 revealed only trivial MR and a LVEF of
55% - improved from prior studies. He otherwise maintained
stable hemodynamics and remained in a normal sinus rhythm.
Medical therapy was optimized and he was transferred to the
floor on POD#7. He was followed closely by the renal and
cardiology services. He worked daily with physical therapy. He
continued to make clinical improvements and was cleared for
discharge to home on POD#8. At time of discharge, he was
tolerating room air and his chest x-ray showed improved aeration
and CHF with only a small residual left pleural effusion. He had
adequate pain control with Dilaudid.
