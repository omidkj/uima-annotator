Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Motrin / Codeine / Nortriptyline

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1070**]
Chief Complaint:
abdominal pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Dialysis,
midline placed

History of Present Illness:
65y/o M with PMH of HIV/AIDs on HAART (VL undectable and CD4 392
in [**6-16**]), ESRD on HD, DM2, PVD recently admitted with line
sepsis treated with vancomycin and now presenting with abd pain
X 5days. He says the pain is all over his abdomen. Denies N/V.
No fever/chills. Denies constipation or diarrhea. He took
percocet at home and says that it did not help.
.
In the ED, his initial vitals signs were T 98.3, BP 162/106, HR
130, RR 18, O2sat 100% RA. He was given dilaudid for pain
control. They felt he might have melana in his rectal vault and
a GI consult was obtained. CT abdomen/pelvis without contrast
was performed and showed a question of pancreatic mass. GI
repeated the rectal exam and said it was guiac positive brown
stool with no melana. He was admitted to the ICU for further
care.
.
Currently, he is lethargic but easily arousable. Says his pain
is much improved. Denies fevers, chills, nausea, vomiting. No
chest pain, no shortness of breath. No diarrhea, no
constipation.
.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2126-12-1**] 6:12 AM
IMPRESSION: No free intraperitoneal air

CT ABDOMEN/PELVIS W/O CONTRAST [**2126-12-1**] 6:31 AM
IMPRESSION:
1. A 4.3 x 4.1 cm ill-defined soft tissue in the pancreatic
head.
2. Bilateral pleural effusion and compressive atelectasis.
Cannot exclude
consolidation.
3. Large hiatal hernia.
4. Stable compression deformity involving L3 and L4 with
narrowing of the
spinal canal at this level. MRI is recommended for further
characterization.
5. Right renal hypodensity, not fully characterized in this
non-contrast
study.
6. Residual left groin hematoma.
7. No evidence of free air or bowel obstruction.

Portable TTE (Complete) [**2126-12-2**]
The left atrium is moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric
left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. Due to
suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality
cannot be fully excluded. There is mild-moderate global left
ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 35-40 %). Systolic function of
apical segments is relatively preserved (suggestive of
non-ischemic cardiomyopathy). Right ventricular chamber size is
normal with mild global free wall hypokinesis. The aortic valve
is not well seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial mitral
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is a very small pericardial effusion without
evidence for hemodynamic compromise.

IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with mild-moderate global hypokinesis
with relative preservation of apical segments most suggestive of
a non-ischemic cardiomyopathy. Mild right ventricular free wall
hypokinesis. Moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2125-11-17**],
biventricular systolic function is now depressed (global). The
estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is similar.

CT ABD W&W/O CON [**2126-12-2**]
IMPRESSION:
1. Bilateral pleural effusion and adjacent
atelectasis/consolidation.
2. Large hiatal hernia.
3. Atrophic kidneys with multiple bilateral hypoattenuating
lesions too small
to fully characterize.
4. Slightly heterogeneous appearance of the pancreatic head
although without
discrete mass. These findings may relate to focal fatty
infiltration. MRI
may be helpful for further characterization.
5. Diffu
