History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] (Eu Crit [**Doctor First Name **]) is a 79 yo M with h/o CAD s/p CABG,
HTN, HL who presents after MVC with IVH.The patient was driving
and apparently hit a telephone pole. He remembers driving but
cannot remember any events leading up to the crash, or any
abnormal symptoms. He was brought to OSH ED where head CT showed
IVH. He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] where he was hypertensive on
arrival SBP>200. In the ED he received labetalol and phenytoin.
Trauma was consulted. R wrist had laceration, irrigated and will
be monitored only by plastics. FAST showed a question of LUQ
cyst, so CT abdomen was done. Neurosurgery was consulted for
IVH.
The patient is currently denying headache, N/V, vision
changes,numbness, weakness or tingling.

CT Head [**2-16**] - Overall stable extent of intraventricular
hemorrhage and probable concurrent subdural hemorrhage along the
tentorium cerebelli. Stable ventricular size. No new hemorrhage

Chest CT [**2-16**] -
1. No acute rib fracture.
2. 6-cm mass-like lesion along the right basilar lateral region,
with
heterogeneous attenuation, not acute hematoma, could be neoplasm
or unusual rounded atelectasis.
3. Heterogeneous collection medial to the right middle lobe,
could represent an old hematoma or postinfectious phlegmon.
Recommend correlation with prior history of trauma.
4. Moderate volume loss of right hemithorax with pleural
thickening, of
uncertain chronicity and etiology.
5. Status post CABG, with significant coronary artery
calcifications
involving all three vessels.
6. Simple cholelithiasis without acute cholecystitis.

Ct head [**2-18**] - 1. Interval development of hydrocephalus.
  2. Stable appearance of intracranial hemorrhage with interval
redistribution
of clot

CT head [**2-19**] - 1. Unchanged hydrocephalus with intraventricular
hemorrhage. New right frontal approach ventriculostomy catheter.

2. Small subarachnoid hemorrhage in the right parietal lobe

CT head [**2-20**] - 1. Unchanged hydrocephalus with intraventricular
hemorrhage. New right frontal approach ventriculostomy catheter.

2. Small subarachnoid hemorrhage in the right parietal lobe

CT head [**2-22**] - Mildly decreased ventriculomegaly. See details
above. The tip of the catheter
is in the septum pellucidum close to the left foramen of [**Last Name (un) 2044**],
unchanged

CT head [**2-25**] - Status post removal of ventricular drain with
interval mild
prominence of the ventricles compared to most recent CT head. An
interval
increase in amount of free air in the right frontal and temporal
[**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the ventricle. Similar focus of subarachnoid hemorrhage
along the right occipital and pariteal gyri. Similar
intraventricular hemorrhage.
CT head [**2-26**] - Resolving intraventricular hemorrhage and nearly
resolved right subarachnoid hemorrhage. Persistent air in the
right lateral ventricle status post removal of ventriculostomy
catheter.

CT head [**2-26**] - 1. The new right frontal approach
intraventricular catheter terminates in the left frontal [**Doctor Last Name 534**].
Minimal decrease in the size of the lateral ventricles.
2. Minimal new blood adjacent to the catheter tip.

3. Unchanged residual blood in the right lateral ventricle
atrium and in few right parietal sulci

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] Neurosurgery service after an
IVH caused an MVA. CTA ruled out aneurysm. CT chest was done for
rib pain and this showed multiple lung abnormalities. the family
was informed and they agreed. On [**2-17**], patient was seen to be
neuro intact. On [**2-18**], in am rounds, he was seen to move all
extremities, but non verbal with no eye opening, no commands. A
stat head ct revealed hydrocephalus and an abg showed no CO2
retention. He was then transferred to the ICU and an EVD was
placed and leveled at 10.

On [**2-19**], a repeat head CT shows decreased IVH, but ventricles
were still plump. EVD at 10 with low ICP pressures. His exam was
improved, he was A&Ox3 and full strength throughout, but still
somewhat lethargic. He remained int he ICU for neuro monitoring.
On [**2-20**], patient reported nausea, he was seen to be more
lethargic and  confused, a repeat head CT was done which showed
slight 1mm increase in 3rd ventreicle.

On [**2-21**] his mental status improved and his EVD was raised to 20.
His Aspirin and SQH were started. His ICP's remained low and his
EVD was clamped on the morning on [**2-22**]. CT in the afternoon
showed no increase in ventricular size. The drain remained
clamped. Pulmonology saw the patient for his newly discovered
lung lesions and they recommended a PET CT and CT guided FNA
with outpatient clinic follow up. Overnight, patient's EVD
became disconnected. Exam was unchanged and the drain was
reconnected sterily.

On [**2-23**], patient was alert and oriented x3, follows all commands
and full strength. His EVD remained clamped overnight and
patient's exam remained intact. His EVD was removed and he was
transferred to step down. PT consult was placed.

Over the weekend, patient was seen to have drainage from EVD
site. A dressing was placed and was saturated on Sunday morning.
A repeat head CT showed increase in ventricle size. On [**2-26**],
patient exam worsened, he was more lethargic and difficult to
arouse. He was taken to the OR for VP shunt placement. In OR,
opening pressure was observed to be 38. Shunt was placed with
the assistance of general surgery and no complication were
observed. Post operatively, patient was more alert and ansering
questions appropriately. Head CT was stable and he was
transferred to the floor. On [**2-27**], patient was stable, PT was
consulted and he was being screened fo
