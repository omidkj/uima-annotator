History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 931**] is a 47 yo male with h/o DM, kidney/pancreas
transplant in [**2183**] and recent STEMI that was medically managed
in late [**12-18**] who was transferred from OSH with SOB. Hx was
obtained mostly from notes as pt quite somnolent on exam. Pt
presented to OSH today with c/o 2 weeks of progressive dyspnea
and pedal edema. His sats were 70% on RA and 92% on NRB with RR
40. He was placed on Bipap with sats 94-95% and CXR showed
whiteout in his lungs. He was treated with Rocephin,solumedrol
125 mg, 80 mg IV lasix, ativan and nitro gtt. Additionally, his
troponin T was noted to be 1.17, proBNP 70,000 (baseline
30,000), WBC 21.8 with a left shift. ABG there was 7.39/32/71.
He was then transferred to [**Hospital1 **].
.
Upon arrival to the ER here his blood pressures were stable. His
sats were 98% on 15L NRB. Since he appeared to be using his
ascessory muscles he was switched to BIPAP with sats of 95%. An
additional 80 of IV lasix was administered at that time and he
put out 1.1L over the past 6 hours. CXR was done and showed
evidence of PNA. Additionally in the ER troponin was noted to
elevated and ST elevations were seen on EKG. After d/w cards it
was determined the trop was trending down from previous STEMI
and ST changes were residual from previous STEMI.
.
Currently patient is on BIPAP and answering questions
periodically and falling back asleep.


Past Medical History:
STEMI (admitted [**Date range (1) 26574**]) decided to medically manage in
the setting of renal failure and Cr of 6 and the fact that event
had likely occurred several days prior. MIBI showed EF of18%.
DM1 x 12 yo- pt has been off insulin and no longer checks BS
R toe amputation
Osteopenia
Urethral stricture
Penile implant
Sleep apnea history
bilateral IVH in [**2195**]
Kidney/pancreas transplant [**2183**]:
His kidney transplant is present in his RLQ, pancreas transplant

is in his LLQ (enteric conversion was performed where pancreas
was moved from bladder to GI).
Rejection [**2183**]
Recent admit for elevated Cr thought [**3-16**] to lasix and ACEI as
well as recent STEMI


Social History:
No ETOH, 20 pky smoker, quit [**2183**] before transplant, smokes
marijuana rarely, no heroin, no cocaine. Married with 2
children, works for [**Company 11293**].


Family History:
Brother - deceased from MI at age 52, also had diabetes s/p
transplant
Father - deceased from MI at age 53

Pertinent Results:
EKG: NSR with LAD; TWI in I,AVL,V2-V6 (new in V2,V3)
q in v2-v5; persistent ST elevations V3-V5 (present previously
in V3,V4).
.
CXR [**2198-2-10**] prelim read: Worsening airspace opacities likely
representing consolidation with some element of edema;
pneumonia. No effusions.
.
Exercise MIBI [**12-18**]:
1. Moderate, predominantly fixed perfusion defect involving the

mid-distal anterior wall, the apex, and the distal septum. 2.
Marked left ventricular enlargement. 3. Severe global
hypokinesis, with superimposed apical dyskinesis. LVEF=18%.
.
ECHO [**2198-1-1**]:
Moderate aortic valve stenosis, AoV area 0.8 cm2. Mild symmetric
left ventricular hypertrophy with regional systolic dysfunction
c/w CAD (mid-LAD territory), EF 30%. Moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension, PASP 48mm Hg.
.
LENI [**2198-2-13**]: Possible old, nonocclusive thrombus within a
duplicated left superficial femoral vein. Remainder of the deep
veins in the lower extremities bilaterally are unremarkable.
.
RENAL U/S [**2198-2-13**]:
1) Tardus parvus waveforms within the segmental arteries
supplying the renal parenchyma with decreased resistive indices
suggestive of parenchymal hypoperfusion.
2) No hydronephrosis.
.
TTE [**2198-2-13**]:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. The estimated right
atrial pressure is >20 mmHg. The left ventricular cavity is
moderately dilated. Overall left ventricular systolic function
is severely depressed. Transmitral Doppler and tissue velocity
imaging are consistent with Grade II (moderate) LV diastolic
dysfunction. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic
valve leaflets are moderately thickened with mild to moderate
aortic stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. Significant pulmonic Regurgitation is
seen. The end-diastolic pulmonic regurgitation velocity is
increased suggesting pulmonary artery diastolic hypertension.
There is a small pericardial effusion. There are no
echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
.
CT HEAD [**2198-2-28**]: 1.  No evidence of acute intracranial
hemorrhage.  Stable appearance of the brain compared to [**2195-9-2**].

2.  New opacification of the mastoid air cells bilaterally and
right middle ear cavity in this intubated patient.
.
RENAL U/S [**2198-3-11**]: Overall stable appearance of the renal
transplant with tardus-parvus waveforms within the parenchymal
segmental arteries suggestive of parenchymal hypoperfusion.


Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 47 yo male with h/o DM, kidney/pancreas transplant in [**2183**]
and recent STEMI that was medically managed in late [**12-18**] who
was transferred from OSH with SOB, likely PNA and CHF
exacerbation.
.
1) Respiratory failure: Patient's sats were in the 70s on RA at
OSH. CXR showed whiteout c/w bilateral patchy PNA +/- CHF
exacerbation. Following admission, patient was initially
maintained on BiPAP for what appeared to be increased work of
breathing, though sats were stable at the time. On transfer to
[**Hospital1 18**], patient failed to improve clinically with diuresis,
making CHF seem less likely to be the etiology of his
respiratory failure. Bilateral patchy infiltrate was visualized;
this atypical pattern for community-acquired pneumonia raised
concerns for PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. fungal vs. multifocal bacterial pneumonia
in this chronically immunosuppressed host.  On HD#2, he was
intubated for respiratory distress. Diagnostic bronchoscopy and
BAL were performed with unrevealing culture data.  He was
initially was treated empirically for PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] Bactrim
discontinued due to nephrotoxicity and highly sensitive BAL
negative for PCP.  [**Name10 (NameIs) **] was treated with a 10-day course of
levaquin and vancomycin for broad spectrum coverage as no
organism was isolated.  Serum fungal markers negative for
aspergillus, equivocal for beta-glucan.  Patient remained
ventilator-dependent from [**2-12**] - [**3-1**], on CPAP + PS with ongoing
high ventilatory requirements likely due to fluid overload which
was compounded by acute oliguric on chronic renal failure.
Course was complicated by a MSSA ventilator-acquired pneumonia
which was treated with 8 days of vancomycin and zosyn.
Following improvement of renal function, we diuresed
aggressively with lasix gtt and lasix boluses.  On [**3-1**], he was
extubated despite poor prognostic indicators due to the
chronicity of his vent-dependence, with plan for tracheostomy if
he did not tolerate non-invasive respiratory support.  He was
transitioned to face-mask O2 and ultimately did not require the
planned
