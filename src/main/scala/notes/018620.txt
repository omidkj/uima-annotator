patient also had an impressive pelvic mass which was thought to
be an uterine fibroid, and a combined approach for her
hysterectomy and esophagectomy was scheduled for the patient who

A left-sided chest tube has been removed. There is a tiny
residual left
apical pneumothorax. There is a patchy opacity in the lingula
and a small
residual left pleural effusion. There is a small left lower lobe

consolidation. There is a small right pleural effusion with
atelectasis at
the right base. A right large bore catheter terminates in the
superior vena
cava. Two access needles are present. There is a right middle
lobe
infiltrate, unchanged from prior study. Heart is top normal in
size.
Mediastinum is within normal limits. There is a faint right
upper lobe
infiltrate as well. None of these have changed since prior
study.
