PECIMEN SUBMITTED: LEFT BKA REVISION.

[**2106-2-8**] [**2106-2-9**] [**2106-2-11**] DR. [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 12033**]/nwf
Previous biopsies:    [**Numeric Identifier 22944**]  LEFT BKA.
  [**Numeric Identifier 22945**]  DISC MATERIAL/lb.

DIAGNOSIS:

Bone and tissue, left below-knee amputation revision (A-E):

Acute and chronic osteomyelitis.
Changes consistent with prior surgical procedure.

INDICATIONS FOR CATHETERIZATION:
NSTEMI, chest pain
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Moderate systolic and diastolic left ventricular dysfunction.
3. Successful PCI of the RCA with two drug-eluting stents.
COMMENTS:
1. Selective coronary angiography showed a right dominant system
with
thjree vessel disease. The LMCA was angiographically without
disease.
The LAD had a distal 70% stenosis. The LCX was small and had a
subtotally occluded AV branch. The RCA was diffusely diseased
and had a
focal mid 95% stenosis. The distal RCA had 70% stenosis prior to
bifurcation.
2. Limiting resting hemodynamics showed moderately elevated left
sided
filling pressures (LVEDP 22 mmHg). There was no gradient across
te
aortic valve. Left ventricolography showed no significanyt
mitral
regurgitation. There was inferobasal akinesis. The calculated
contrast
ejection fraction was 41%.
3. Successful PCI of the mid and distal RCA with a 2.5 x 28 mm
Cypher
DES and a 2.5 x 8 mm Cypher DES (respectively).
4. Unsuccessful attempt to cross into the LCX/OM.

Findings
LEFT ATRIUM: Mild LA enlargement.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: A catheter or pacing wire is
seen in the RA.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thickness. Mildly dilated LV
cavity. Moderate regional LV systolic dysfunction. [Intrinsic LV
systolic function depressed given the severity of valvular
regurgitation.] No resting LVOT gradient.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTA: Normal aortic root diameter.

AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS.
Trace AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. No MVP.
Mild mitral annular calcification. Mild thickening of mitral
valve chordae. Moderate (2+) MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Mildly thickened tricuspid valve leaflets. Mild
[1+] TR. Mild PA systolic hypertension.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflets
with physiologic PR.

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.
Conclusions
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity is mildly
dilated. There is moderate regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction with thinning and hypokinesis of the inferior and
infero-lateral walls. Right ventricular chamber size and free
wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Trace aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Moderate (2+)
mitral regurgitation
