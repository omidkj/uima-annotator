ADDENDUM TO DISCHARGE SUMMARY# [**Serial Number 14266**]:  The patient was
originally thought to not have a septic joint and was going
to be DC'd to [**Hospital 3058**] rehab at [**Hospital 38**] Rehab where there
was a dialysis bed available.  At that time, the patient had
an increase in his white blood cell count up to 22, and the
patient had increased pain in his left shoulder.  Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **]
from orthopedic surgery returned to the bedside and did a tap
of the glenohumeral joint which revealed 47,000 white blood
cells and trace crystals that were nondiagnostic for gout.
Per orthopedic surgery, the patient was taken to the OR for
washout of the left shoulder joint on [**2180-10-25**].
Intraoperatively, the patient became hypotensive and required
resuscitation.  The patient was discharged from the OR to the
ICU where he had a short stay and recovered well,
postoperative course being unremarkable.  The patient was
discharged to the floor on [**2180-10-28**], and his postop course
there was unremarkable.  On [**2180-10-30**], the patient is
reporting improved function in the left arm.  There is a
Hemovac drain in place that will be DC'd on [**2180-10-30**] prior to
discharge to rehab.  The patient's white count is trending
downward.  The patient is to be discharged to [**Hospital 3058**]
rehabilitation center prior to going home.

In addition, the patient was found to have a 2.5 cm
smooth-walled cavitary lesion in the periphery of the left
lower lobe on a CT of the chest located in the subpleural
space.  Per report, the radiologic characteristics are not
typical for a cavitating tumor.  In the absence of additional
lesions, septic embolus is less likely.  Findings are most
consistent with an infectious process.

Infectious disease was consulted, and their recommendations
included DCing to rehab with 6+ weeks of IV antibiotic
therapy.  The patient is to receive 1 gm of vancomycin IV q
hemodialysis, equaling three times a week.  The patient was
stable to go per orthopedics, as well as per the transplant
surgery service.

The patient is to follow-up, as noted before, with Dr.
[**First Name (STitle) **] on [**2180-11-2**] at 10:40 am, and with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] in
the Orthopedic Surgery Clinic; please call for follow-up.
