CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2102-2-6**] 10:26 AM
CHEST (PA & LAT)
Reason: evaluate effusion right

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
23 year old man s/p AVR
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
evaluate effusion right
INDICATION: Status post 23 year status post AVR, evaluate for
right effusion.
COMPARISON: [**2102-2-2**].
FRONTAL & LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS:
Tracheostomy tube again seen with tip approximately 3.5 cm from
the carina. Median sternotomy wires again noted. Pacing leads
again seen in unchanged position. Cardiac and mediastinal
contours appear stable. No focal consolidations are seen within
the lungs. Loculated right pleural effusion appears relatively
unchanged. New small amount of free air is seen under the right
hemidiaphragm, improving left basilar atelectasis and effusion
also again noted.
IMPRESSION: Persistent loculated right pleural effusion. A small
amount of free air noted under the right hemidiaphragm,
consistent with patient's recent history of PEG placement.

Cardiology Report ECHO Study Date of [**2102-1-16**]
PATIENT/TEST INFORMATION:
Indication: Aortic valve disease. Endocarditis. Evaluation for
abscess. Left ventricular function. Right ventricular function.

Status: Inpatient
Date/Time: [**2102-1-16**] at 14:14
Test: Portable TEE (Complete)
Doppler: Full Doppler and color Doppler
Contrast: None
Tape Number: 2007W000-0:00

REFERRING DOCTOR: DR. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 177**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]
MEASUREMENTS:
Aortic Valve - Peak Velocity: *3.0 m/sec (nl <= 2.0 m/sec)
Aortic Valve - Peak Gradient: 36 mm Hg
INTERPRETATION:
Findings:
The patient was intubated and sedated with infusions of
midazolam and fentanyl during the procedure.
This study was compared to the prior study of [**2102-1-5**].
LEFT ATRIUM: Normal LA size.
RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: A catheter or pacing wire is
seen in the RA and extending into the RV. No ASD by 2D or color
Doppler.
LEFT VENTRICLE: Severely dilated LV cavity. Depressed LVEF.
RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size. Severe global RV free
wall
hypokinesis.
AORTA: Normal ascending, transverse and descending thoracic
aorta with no
atherosclerotic plaque.
AORTIC VALVE: Bioprosthetic aortic valve prosthesis (AVR). AVR
well seated, normal leaflet/disc motion and transvalvular
gradients. No masses or vegetations on aortic valve. Trace AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Normal mitral valve leaflets with trivial MR. [**Name13 (STitle) **]
mass or
vegetation on mitral valve.
TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets. No mass or
vegetation on
tricuspid valve. Mild [1+] TR.
PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Thickened pulmonic valve
leaflets. No
vegetation/mass on pulmonic valve. Significant PR.
PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.
GENERAL COMMENTS: Local anesthesia was provided by benzocaine
topical spray.  The patient was sedated for the TEE. Medications
and dosages are listed above  (see Test Information section). No
TEE related complications. 0.2 mg of IV glycopyrrolate was given
as an antisialogogue prior to TEE probe insertion.
The patient appears to be in sinus rhythm.
Conclusions:
The left atrium is normal in cavity size. No atrial septal
defect is seen by  2D or color Doppler. The left ventricular
cavity is severely dilated with  severe global hypokinesis.
There is severe global right ventricular free wall  hypokinesis.
The ascending, transverse and descending thoracic aorta are
normal in diameter and free of atherosclerotic plaque. A
bioprosthetic aortic  valve prosthesis is present. The aortic
prosthesis appears well seated, with  normal leaflet motion. No
masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve. Trace aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears structurally
normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. No mass or vegetation
is seen on the mitral valve. The pulmonic valve leaflets are
thickened. No vegetation/mass is seen on the pulmonic valve.
Significant pulmonic regurgitation is seen. There  is no
pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Well seated aortic valve prosthesis with no echo
evidence of
abscess or vegetation. Severely dilated left ventricular cavity
with severe  global hypokinesis. Severe right ventricular free
wall hypokinesis.

Compared with the post-operative images from the prior study
(images reviewed)
of [**2102-1-5**], the findings are similar.




Brief Hospital Course:
He was admitted to the cardiac surgery ICU [**2101-12-24**]. He failed a
spontaneous breathing trial and remained intubated with tube
feeds. He was seen by infectious disease and placed on
vancomycin, unasyn, gentamicin and doxycycline. TEE on [**12-25**]
showed abscess at confluence of anterior mitral leaflet and
posterior aspect of aortic root, markedly thickened and
edematous anterior aortic root, a bicuspid AV, wide open AI,
large vegetation on AV.EF 30%. On [**12-26**] he was extubated and
reintubated for respiratory distress. A thoracentesis was
performed for 1600 cc. He was seen by general surgery for his
chole tube, with recommendations to complete cardiac surgery
first and then perform chole in [**1-28**] months. He was seen by
cardiology for his PPM. Bronchoscopy on [**12-29**] showed no lesions,
bleeding or secretions. BAL was done. He had a temp of 102.5 and
was f
