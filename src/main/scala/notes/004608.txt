HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 86-year-old woman
with history of hypertension and no known coronary artery
disease who presents to [**Hospital6 256**]
from an outside hospital, [**Hospital3 **], following an
episode of chest pain on the day of admission.  Patient
reportedly was walking down the stairs in the a.m. of
admission when she reported [**8-28**] chest heaviness with left
arm radiation, nausea, and diaphoresis.  Pain reportedly
resolved spontaneously.  Emergency medical services were
called.  Initial EKG showed 1 to 1.[**Street Address(2) 1755**] elevations in 2,
3, and aVF.

The patient was taken to [**Hospital6 3105**], reporting
4/10 chest pain, and subsequently received 2 mg of Morphine
with subsequent hypotension into the 70s requiring a 250 cc
normal saline bolus with adequate response.  Subsequently,
the patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].  When en route the
patient had a questionable episode of nonsustained
ventricular tachycardia, however was otherwise asymptomatic.
She was given aspirin, Heparin, Lasix intravenously and
prepared for catheterization the next day.

ALLERGIES:
1.  Penicillin-unspecific reaction.
2.  Codeine-hives.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Multiple pneumonias over the last two years.
2.  Hypertension.
3.  Status post colectomy for colon encapsulated cancer in
[**2122**].
4.  History of hysterectomy.
5.  Hemorrhoids.
6.  Osteoporosis.
7.  Cataracts with bilateral eye surgeries.

MEDICATIONS:
1.  Norvasc 5 q.d.
2.  Albuterol inhalers.
3.  Fosamax at home.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Denies alcohol, denies tobacco.  Social
alcohol use.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Mother with myocardial infarction in her
80s.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Vital signs:  95.3 F,
124/50, 65, 18, 100% on 3 liters.  Exam is remarkable for
right surgically repaired pupil.  Lungs sounds are clear to
auscultation bilaterally.  Heart is regular rate and rhythm.
Abdomen is soft, nontender, nondistended.  There is no
evidence of peripheral edema.  2+ pulses distally, radial and
posterior tibial.  Neuro exam:  Patient is alert and oriented
times three.

LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION:  Patient had CK of 307, MB
fraction of 23, index of 7.5, and a troponin T of 0.42.

A chest x-ray showed no effusions with mild increased
interstitial markings in the right middle lobe.

EKG from the outside hospital was notable for [**Street Address(2) 4793**]
elevations in 2, 3, and aVF.  At [**Hospital1 18**] EKG showed normal
sinus rhythm, rate 56, poor R wave progression with no
evidence of ST elevations.

SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  This is an 86-year-old female
with a history of hypertension and no known prior coronary
artery disease who presented on the day of admission with
chest pain, nausea, vomiting, diaphoresis, inferior ST
elevations, and positive CK-MB and troponins consistent with
an inferior MI.  Review by problem:

1.  Status post MI:  On presentation to [**Hospital1 18**] from [**Hospital6 23267**] the patient denied current chest pain, and
EKG showed no evidence of acute ST changes.  Patient was
transferred to the CCU for monitoring, was started on aspirin
and Heparin, given Plavix load, started on Integrilin drip,
and was scheduled for a catheterization within 24 hours.

Cardiac catheterization showed a right dominant system
revealing two-vessel coronary artery disease of the left
anterior descending and right coronary artery.  Left
ventriculography demonstrated depressed ventricular function
and inferior apical hypokinesis.  Successful stenting of the
proximal mid RCA with a Hepacoat stent was performed.  Final
angiography showing no residual obstruction, dissection, and
good flow.

The patient was subsequently transferred back to the CCU and
then to the floor without further complication.  She was
continued on her current medical management and continued on
aspirin, statin, Plavix, ACE inhibitor, and beta blocker with
nitroglycerin as needed for chest pain.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Stable, breathing comfortably on room
air, and ambulating without assistance.

DISPOSITION:  Will be discharged home with services for blood
pressure checks and medication management/compliance.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Aspirin 81 mg tablet p.o. q.d.
2.  Atorvastatin 10 mg p.o. q.d.
3.  Plavix 75 mg p.o. q.d.
4.  Lisinopril 2.5 mg p.o. q.d.
5.  Atenolol 25 mg p.o. q.d.
6.  Nitroglycerin 0.4 mg tablets p.r.n. for chest pain.
7.  Folic acid.
8.  Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d.
9.  Albuterol inhaler.
10. Protonix 20 mg p.o. q.d.
11. Ipratropium inhaler q. four to six as needed for
shortness of breath or wheezing.
12.  Fosamax 70 mg tablet p.o. q. week.

for continued management of cardiac regimen for an outpatient
stress test.
2.  Patient was instructed to contact her primary care
physician within one week.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Inferior myocardial infarction.
