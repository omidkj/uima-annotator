Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 165**]
Chief Complaint:
shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Coronary artery bypass grafting times four (LIMA>LAD, SVG>OM,
SVG>Diag, SVG>PDA), MV repair (#28 ring) [**2164-6-4**]


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 65 year old male with a past medical history
significant for rheumatic fever, tobacco use and asthma who
presented with shortness of breath which began on Sun [**5-27**]. He
reported no associated chest pain. He initially thought it to be
an asthma exacerbation but the following day presented to an
outside hospital with persistent shortness of breath.  He was
given oxygen and Ativan, with resolution of symptoms.  He was
found to have a troponin of 11.[**Street Address(2) 112237**] elevations. He was treated with Lopressor, ASA,
Heparin drip and cardiology was consulted for cardiac
catherization.  He was also noted to have diffuse infiltrates on
chest radiograph with a leukocytosis of 13.4.  He was treated
with Levaquin for presumed pneumonia. A cardiac catheterization
today revealed three vessel coronary artery disease.  He was
given Plavix.  He was tranferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for surgical
evaluation and Plavix washout.

Findings
LEFT ATRIUM: Dilated LA. All four pulmonary veins identified and
enter the left atrium.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Normal RA size. No ASD by 2D or
color Doppler.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Moderate-severe regional left ventricular
systolic dysfunction.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTA: Normal aortic diameter at the sinus level. Mildly dilated
ascending aorta.

AORTIC VALVE: Normal aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS. No AR.

GENERAL COMMENTS: Written informed consent was obtained from the
patient. The patient was under general anesthesia throughout the
procedure. The TEE probe was passed with assistance from the
anesthesioology staff using a laryngoscope. No TEE related
complications. The patient appears to be in sinus rhythm.
patient.
Conclusions
The left atrium is dilated. No atrial septal defect is seen by
2D or color Doppler. There is moderate to severe regional left
ventricular systolic dysfunction with apical akinesis, severe
hypokinesis in the inferolateral, inferior, and inferoseptal
walls. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. An eccentric, posteriorly directed jet of
Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is
no pericardial effusion.
Post bypass
The patient is s/p CABGX3 with mitral annuloplasty ring.
The patient is on a Norepinephrine drip at 0.2 mcg/kg/min
,milrinone drip at 0.125 mcg/kg/min
The cardiac index is 3.3
There is a well seated mitral annuloplasty ring with no
paravalvular leaks present.There is mild valvular mitral
regurgitation present.
The mean gradient across the mitral valve is 9 mmhg with a peak
gradient of 29 mmhg across the mitral valve
The ejection fraction is 35%

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was brought to the Operating Room on [**2164-6-4**] where
the patient underwent a coronary artery bypass grafting times
four (LIMA to LAD, SVG>OM, SVG>Diag, SVG>PDA), mitral valve
repair.  Please see the operative note for details.  Overall the
patient tolerated the procedure well and post-operatively was
transferred to the CVICU in stable condition for recovery and
invasive monitoring.  POD 1 found the patient extubated, alert
and oriented and breathing comfortably.  The patient was
neurologically intact and hemodynamically stable, weaned from
inotropic and vasopressor support.  Beta blocker was initiated
and the patient was gently diuresed toward the preoperative
weight.  The patient was transferred to the telemetry floor for
further recovery.  Chest tubes and pacing wires were
discontinued without complication.  The patient was evaluated by
the physical therapy service for assistance with strength and
mobility.  By the time of discharge on POD four the patient was
ambulating freely, the wound was healing and pain was controlled
with oral analgesics.  The patient was discharged to home in
good condition with appropriate follow up instructions.
