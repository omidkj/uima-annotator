History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 56752**] presented from the [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] in NH where he presented
for evaluation of subjective fever and mild abdominal
discomfort.  He noted that he had been feeling nauseous for the
past week, correlating with when he began taking his AZT.  This
was discontinued but his sensation of nausea has persisted.  Two
days PTA, he began feeling a mild discomfort in the
periumbilical region which has persisted.  The pain is
intermittent and mild, unchanged with eating or position.  He
denied diarrhea, BRBPR, recent dietary changes, or other
symptoms.  In the ED at the [**Hospital1 **], he was noted to have a
temperature of 100.2F and was given a dose of ceftriaxone prior

Micro data:
Over 90 cultures of various types were drawn.  Positives
include:
[**2-16**]  sinus aspirate Aspergillus [**Country 11730**]
[**2-24**]  sinus aspirate Aspergillus [**Country 11730**] (subsequent culture
negative)
[**3-4**]  + VRE on screening rectal swab
[**3-17**]  R neck wound swab positive for VRE

Imaging:
[**2130-1-30**]: CT Sinus: IMPRESSION:
1) Left nasal cavity lesion with mixed attenuation, as described
above. An MR is recommended for better evaluation of this
lesion.
2) Maxillary retention cyst and mild ethmoid sinus mucosal
thickening.

CT TORSO [**1-30**]: IMPRESSION:
1) A 3-4 mm vague nodule in the right upper lobe, new since the
previous exam. This is nonspecific and may represent infection
or lymphoma. Attention to this can be paid on followup.
2) Small hypodense focus within the left kidney, also
nonspecific, which may represent lymphoma.
3) No etiology for left upper quadrant pain or diarrhea
identified.

PET [**1-30**]: IMPRESSION:
1) Unchanged size, but decreased maximum SUV levels of the nasal
cavity mass.
2) Increased FDG activity within the right submandibular node
which appears new compared to the prior study.
3) Three focal new hepatic areas of increased FDG uptake
representing distant metastatic involvement.

[**2130-2-13**] CT abdomen/pelvis:
IMPRESSION:
1. Multiple bilateral low-density lesions within the kidneys, in
retrospect probably unchanged since [**2130-1-30**]. These have
not progressed in the interval and are most likely related to
lymphomatous involvement of the kidneys.
2. Vague stable lung nodules, with a new small focal patchy
density within the left lung, probably due to focal atelectasis.
3. No clear explanation for the ongoing fevers identified.

[**2130-2-15**] MRI abdomen:
IMPRESSION: 1. Small subcapsular lesion within the posterior
right lobe of the liver, with two prominent adjacent draining
veins. This lesion may be related to prior biopsy or trauma.
Please correlate with past medial history. Metastatic disease is
not excluded, but the appearance would be most unusual for a
metastatic lesion .
2. Small delayed phase enhancing lesion within the dome of the
liver, most consistent with a hemangioma, but too small to fully
characterize.
3. Multiple hypoenhancing lesions throughout both kidneys,
consistent with lymphoma, and unchanged compared to CT [**2-13**], [**2130**].

[**2-17**] MR head:
IMPRESSION: Stable appearance of the brain, compared to the
previous MRI of [**2129-12-17**]. No abnormal intracranial
enhancement.
Decreased size of the intranasal mass since the [**Month (only) 1096**] MRI.

[**2-18**] CT torso:
IMPRESSION:
1) Diffuse bilateral increased thickness of the pulmonary
interlobular septa, new compared to the prior study of [**2130-2-13**].
This has the appearance of interstitial pulmonary edema.
Lymphangitic spread of tumor or lymphoma is in the radiologic
differential diagnosis. This appearance would be atypical for
infection but in the presence of possible mild bronchial wall
thickening, infectious process cannot be entirely excluded. No
intra-abdominal abscess is identified.
2) Vague right upper lobe nodule, stable.
3) Stable bilateral rounded ill-defined hypodensities in the
kidneys, stable compared to the prior study.
4) Apparent left varicocele. If clinically indicated,
correlation with ultrasound examination may be performed.

[**3-5**] CT chest:
IMPRESSION:
1) Interval formation of bilateral dependent areas of
consolidation in the lower lobes suggestive of aspiration with
or without overlying pnuemonia.
2) Persistent and increased interstitial and alveolar opacities
bilaterally. Persistent thickening of the interlobular septa.
The differential includes ARDS or less likely interstitial
pulmonary edema or lymphatic spread of tumor or lymphoma.
3) Stable appearance of rounded hypoattenuating areas within the
kidneys. These have increased in the short interval ([**2130-1-30**])
and may represent multifocal pyleonephritis, lymphoma or less
likely infarcts.
4) No evidence of pulmonary embolism.

[**2130-3-9**] RUQ ultrasound with Doppler:
IMPRESSION:
1) Normal-appearing liver with patent portal and hepatic veins.
2) Gallbladder contains s
