BRIEF SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  Patient is a 70-year-old
male, who presented to [**Hospital1 69**]
on [**2125-1-2**] after having slipped and fallen while
walking.  His complaints were of only right chest pain and
flank pain.  He was brought in for further evaluation.
Immediate imaging were obtained.  A chest x-ray did not
reveal any whitening of his mediastinum.  There was no
pneumothorax.  He did undergo a chest CT, which revealed
fractures of his right fifth, sixth, and seventh lateral ribs
without any evidence of pneumothorax.  A CT of his C spine
revealed no fracture or subluxation.  There was, however,
extensive degenerative changes.  A CAT scan of the abdomen
did not reveal any intraabdominal injury.

The patient was admitted to the Trauma service, and given
initially Morphine for pain control.  Aggressive respiratory
therapy which included incentive spirometry, pulmonary
toilet, chest CT as well as nebulizers were started.  Pain
service was contact[**Name (NI) **] to assist with adequate pain control.
Patient was placed for a few days on an epidural.  While the
patient was on the floor, it was noted that he had declining
respiratory status secondary to pain and rib fractures.

A chest x-ray was obtained, which showed bibasilar
atelectasis as well as some patchy consolidation, which was
new from his prior chest x-ray.  It was thought best that the
patient be transferred to the Intensive Care Unit for closer
monitoring.  It was difficult for the patient to clear his
secretions, and given a desaturation, it was thought best
that the patient be intubated for a few days, though his
respiratory status improved.

On transport to the Intensive Care, it was noted that the
epidural had fallen out, and it was replaced.  A sputum
sample was sent, which later revealed Hemophilus influenza as
well as Streptococcus pneumonia.  He was started on a 14 day
course of Levaquin.  He was a short course of tube feeds.  He
was eventually weaned to extubation, and extubated on
hospital day seven.  He continued to remain in the Intensive
Care Unit for a few more days secondary to desaturations into
the 80s.  After aggressive chest PT and pulmonary toilet as
well as suctioning, it was felt that the patient was stable
enough for transfer back to the floor.  Serial chest x-rays
showed improvement in the consolidation.  Patient was
actually switched to a p.o. regimen for pain control, which
was adequate.

He had complained of some chest pain as well as some mild
shortness of breath.  An EKG was obtained which was within
normal limits, and he remained clinically stable.  He was
thought to continue with aggressive pulmonary care.  His diet
was advanced which was tolerated.  Physical Therapy and
Occupational Therapy evaluated the patient.  It was thought
best that the patient be discharged to a rehabilitation
center after his hospital course.  It was felt that the
patient was stable for discharge on hospital day 14 for
further respiratory therapy.
