Thoracentesis

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 106273**] is a [**Age over 90 **] yo M with h/o metastatic prostate cancer,
hypothyroidism, and diastolic CHF, who was recently discharged
from [**Hospital1 18**] in [**2-/2168**] s/p fall and with concern for C1 and C7
fractures, who now presents from [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] with hypoxia and
evidence of R-sided pleural effusion on CXR.
.
The patient was discharged to [**Location (un) **] Independent Living
[**2168-2-17**], a skilled nursing facility, and reports that he has
had significant difficulty carrying out his activities of daily
living, and even taking part in his leisure activities as well.
Last night, the patient endorses that his breathing became
significantly more difficult, and due to this noticeable
shortness of breath, the patient's nurses called an ambulance
and had him taken to the [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] ED.
.
At [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**], Mr. [**Known lastname 106273**] had an O2 Sat in the 80s and
underwent imaging that showed a large right-sided pleural
effusion. The patient was then placed on 2L oxygen by NC and was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further care.
.
In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, initial VS were: T 98.4 HR: 88 BP: 97/61 RR: 22
O2Sat: 97 on 3L NC.  Due to findings on CXR, the patient was
admitted to the MICU for management of his pleural effusions
(which have shown to be malignant effusions in the past), given
that the Interventional Pulmonart team was unable to perform the
procedure this evening.
.
On arrival to the MICU, patient's VS were: T 98.3 HR: 90 BP:
110/57 RR: 22 O2Sat: 97 on 3L NC.  The patient had no other
concerns or complaints.
.

IMAGING/STUDIES:
================
.
[**2168-4-3**] Radiology CHEST (PORTABLE AP:
IMPRESSION:
Compared with [**2168-4-1**] at 19:17 p.m., a tiny curvilinear
density at the right lung apex is again noted. I doubt, but
cannot entirely exclude, a tiny right apical pneumothorax. No
interval change is identified.

Otherwise, no significant change is detected. Again seen is
prominent
cardiomediastinal silhouette; R>L effusions with underlying
collapse and/or
consolidation; unusual appearance to the right posterior ribs
and right chest wall, unchanged. Bilateral effusions are grossly
stable in size.
.
[**2168-4-1**] Radiology CHEST (PORTABLE AP):
IMPRESSION:
1. Bilateral effusions and parenchymal changes essentially
unchanged compared with earlier the same day.
2. Possible tiny right apical pneumothorax.
3. Abnormal increased density along right chest wall is
unchanged, but of
uncertain etiology. If clinically indicated, CT could help to
further
characterize this abnormality.
4. Poor visualization of the right posterior fifth and sixth
ribs. Has there been prior surgical resection? Otherwise, rib
lesions would be suspected.
.
[**2168-4-1**] Radiology LIVER OR GALLBLADDER US:
IMPRESSION:
-No biliary dilatation is seen. Cholelithiasis. There are no
specific signs of cholecystitis or other sources of infection
-Bilateral pleural effusions and trace ascites
-Splenomegaly
-Simple right renal cysts
.
[**2168-4-1**] Radiology CHEST (PORTABLE AP):
IMPRESSION:
Moderate right pleural effusion has markedly decreased in
amount. There is no evident pneumothorax. There are persistent
low lung volumes. A small left pleural effusion has increased.
Left lower lobe and left mid perihilar opacities have increased
since [**2-14**], unchanged from the prior study, could be
worsening atelectasis and pleural effusion, but superimposed
infection cannot be excluded. Opacity in the right lower lobe is
a combination of pleural effusion and adjacent consolidation,
could be atelectasis and/or pneumonia. The patient has known
osseous mets.
.
[**2168-3-31**] CHEST (PORTABLE AP):
IMPRESSION:
Large right pleural effusion has recurred, displacing the
mediastinum slightly to the left of midline. Osseous metastasis
involving right ribs are longstanding. Heart is at least mildly
enlarged and there is some engorgement of the vessels in the
left lung.
.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 106273**] is a [**Age over 90 **] yo M with h/o metastatic prostate cancer,
hypothyroidism, and diastolic CHF, who was recently discharged
from [**Hospital1 18**] in [**2-/2168**] s/p fall and with concern for C1 and C7
fractures, who now presents from [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] with hypoxia and
evidence of R-sided pleural effusion on CXR now s/p
thoracentisis with possible HCAP.

ACTIVE DIAGNOSES:
=================

#) HYPOXEMIA/PLEURAL EFFUSION/CONCERN FOR HCAP: Patient was
admitted to the MICU with recurrent R-sided pleural effusion
with hypoxia requiring no more than 4LNC. Thoracentesis was
performed at bedside with drainage of 1.5L of fluid with
negative gram stain, exudative chemistry, and lymphocyte
predominance with cytology pending at the time of discharge
though overall felt to be c/w prior malignant pleural effusion.
His breathing improved and he felt clinically well but was
occasionally hypotensive to as low as the 70's systolically,
asymptomatic the whole time. Additionally, despite not having
fevers, elevated lactate or a white count, he had a significant
bandemia which was ne
