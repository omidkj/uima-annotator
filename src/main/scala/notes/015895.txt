PRE-BYPASS:
1. The left atrium is moderately dilated.
2. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
3. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 45 %) with noted
hypokinesis of the apical anterior segment and apex.
4. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal.
5. There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch. There are
simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
6. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is
no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen.
7. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate to
severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen with provocative
maneuvers (Trendelenberg and phenylephrine bolus).
8. There is mild to moderate tricuspid regurgitation.

POST-BYPASS:
Pt removed from cardiopulmonary bypass on phenylephrine infusion
and AV paced.
1. No mitral regurgitation is noted after mitral valve
annuloplasty. MVA by PHT is 2.4cm2. The annuloplasty ring is
well seated.
2. Biventricular function is unchanged LVEF 40%, no new wall
motion abnormalities are noted.

[**2190-2-18**] ECHO
The chest tube, Swan-Ganz catheter, endotracheal tube,
nasogastric tube, and mediastinal drains have all been removed.
No pneumothorax. Some residual atelectatic changes at the left
and possibly also right bases.

3. Mild to moderate tricuspid regurgitation is unchanged.
4. Aortic contours are intact post-decannulation.

PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:  Coronary artery disease, moderate
mitral regurgitation.

BRIEF HISTORY:  This is a 76 year-old female patient, known
coronary artery disease with recent non-ST elevation
myocardial infarction on [**12-17**].  She was also known to have
mitral regurgitation with medical management. Recently, her
symptoms increased and surgery was advised.

FINDINGS:  Her coronary angiograms showed an 80% stenosis of
the left anterior descending. Intraoperative echo showed a
moderate mitral regurgitation. This appeared to be central
with the defect being at the mid posterior leaflet. It was
decided to do a band annuloplasty on this patient.  The 26
[**Doctor Last Name **] [**Doctor Last Name 405**] band was used for the annulus.  The pump
time was 70 minutes; cross clamp time 48 minutes.

OPERATIVE DETAIL:  The chest, abdomen and lower extremities
were scrubbed with Betadine and prepped with Betadine
solution. The chest was opened through a midline sternal-
splitting incision. Hemostasis was secured along the sternal
borders and the left internal mammary artery was taken down.
This artery was small but had good flow. The heparin was
given. The pericardium was opened.  The patient was
cannulated with an ascending aortic cannula in the distal
ascending aorta and a 3 stage venous cannula into the right
atrium. A cardioplegia needle was inserted into the ascending
aorta which will also be used for de-airing. The temperature
was allowed to drift down and an aortic cross clamp was
placed in the distal ascending aorta and cold antegrade blood
cardioplegia was now given.  The heart was arrested and a
total of 1000 ml was infused.  The left atrium was opened and
the [**Doctor Last Name 405**] retractors were placed for exposure. The central
jet was noted.  Then 2-0 non-pledgeted Ethibond sutures were
placed along the posterior annulus from one commissure to the
other. [**Doctor Last Name 405**] 26 band was then sutured and seated over the
posterior annulus. The sutures were tied and on testing once
again, there was no central jet. The left atrium was then
sutured in a single layer with 3-0 Prolene. During the cross
clamp time, a further 400 ml of cold blood cardioplegia was
given through the antegrade cannula. The patient was rewarmed
and the LAD vessel was exposed.  There was diffuse disease
and the internal mammary artery was then anastomosed end-to-
side using 8-0 Prolene. The aorta cross clamp was removed in
the head down position and de-airing measures were taken.
Atrial and ventricular pacing wires were placed and atrially
paced. For a brief period, the EKG showed an ischemic pattern
of the inferior leads; however, this reverted back to
baseline.  The hemostasis was checked with [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) 30565**]
expander and the patient was taken off from bypass with some
Nor-epinephrine. The heparin was reversed with Protamine and
successfully decannulated from the cardiopulmonary bypass
machine. Chest tubes were placed through separate incisions;
one in the left pleural and 2 in the mediastinum.  Once
again, hemostasis was checked and chest wall was then closed
in layers. The sternum was approximated with stainless steel
wires, followed by Monocryl for the fascia and subcutaneous
tissues.  The skin was closed as a subcuticular stitch with
Monocryl. The needle and sponge counts were correct. The
patient tolerated the procedure well and went to the
cardiovascular intensive care unit in stable condition.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2190-2-16**] and taken to
the operating room where she underwent single vessel coronary
artery bypass grafting and a mitral valve repair. Please see
separate dictated operative note for details. Postoperatively
she was transferred to the ICU in stable condition. She was
extubated later that same day. She was weaned from her
vasoactive drips and transferred to the floor on POD #1 for
further recovery. She was gently diuresed towards her
preoperative weight. The physical therapy service was consulted
for assistance with her postoperative strength and mobility. She
