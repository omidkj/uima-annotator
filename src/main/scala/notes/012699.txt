Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 800**]
Chief Complaint:
Transfer from [**Hospital 8641**] Hospital with respiratory failure due to
pneumonia and myocardial infarction.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Broncheoalveolar lavage ([**2124-1-2**])
Endotracheal extubation
Central venous line placement


History of Present Illness:
48 year-old man with HIV/AIDS (CD4 28, VL 65 [**2123-11-4**]; compliant
with HAART), CAD, chronic systolic and diastolic CHF (EF 30%)
who presented to [**Hospital 8641**] Hospital with respiratory failure and
NSTEMI. He presented to the office of his PCP [**12-17**] for a
three-week history of productive cough and was started on
levofloxacin 750 mg without improvement. He was admitted to
[**Hospital 8641**] Hospital [**2123-12-27**] with dyspnea and was intubated in the
ED. Partner states he was febrile to 102 the day of admission.
Chest x-ray with pulmonary edema but no significant
consolidation. He was started on vancomycin/zosyn and continued
on levofloxacin for broad coverage of pneumonia. Afebrile
without leukocytosis during admission.
.
BNP 1041. EKG showed lateral TWI. Cardiac enzymes: [**12-28**] 02:30
CK 348, MB 15.8, troponin I 2.77 -> [**12-28**] 08:00 CK 1514, MB
116.6, troponin I 39.19. He was started on heparin gtt and
integrillin gtt immediately prior to transfer in addition to
home aspirin 325 mg and plavix 75 mg. He was given lasix 40 mg
IV Q8H, however, urine output is not noted.
.
On arrival, the patient had respiratory distress on SIMV with
accesory muscle use, increased expiratory phase, and diffuse
wheezing.

Review of Systems: Unable to obtain.

two mid-LAD lesions; all of them stented); BMS to RPLB in [**3-/2118**]
(in the setting of positive stress and angina); DES to mid-LAD
(in-stent restenosis; in the setting of worsening fatigue and
exertional dyspnea)
- Diastolic and systolic congestive heart failure (LVEF 37-50%,
depending on study; 30% last TTE [**12/2122**])
- Hypertension
- Dyslipidemia
- Hypertriglyceridemia
- Severe peripheral neuropathy, thought secondary to stavudine;
on very large narcotic regimen
- C5-C6 diskectomy and fusion in [**2110**]
- Emphysema
- Depression

Social History:
The patient lives in [**Location (un) 3844**] with his long-term partner.
[**Name (NI) **] has smoked [**Date range (1) 8642**] ppd for the past 30 years. He does not
drink alcohol and has no history of drug use including IV drug
use.

Family History:
He denies any family history of cancer or lung disease.  His
mother has diabetes and coronary artery disease.  He reports
that multiple family members have had MIs at early ages.

HEENT: No scleral icterus or conjunctival erythema, pupils equal
round and reactive to light, ET tube in place
Neck: No cervical or clavicular lymphadenopathy, no JVD
Chest: Scattered faint expiratory wheezing with mild bibasilar
rales; moderately-restricted air movement; no egophony; no
dullness to percussion
Cardiovascular: Borderline tachycardic, regular; normal s1s2; no
murmurs or rubs; nondisplaced PMI
Abdomen: Moderately distended; nontender; normal bowel sounds;
no hepatosplenomegaly
Extremities: 2+ pitting edema bilaterally to the lower shins; 2+
PT pulses; warm, well-perfused; no cyanosis or clubbing
Skin: No lesions, no jaundice
Neuro: Sedated, moving all extremities well

[**12-29**] CT abd:
1. No evidence of hemorrhage in the chest, abdomen or pelvis.
2. Bilateral pleural effusions and consolidations, concerning
for infection.
3. Compression changes in the thoracolumbar spine as detailed
above.
.
[**12-29**] Echo:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is
moderately dilated. No masses or thrombi are seen in the left
ventricle. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
severely depressed (LVEF= 20-25 %) with global hypokinesis and
regioanl akinesis of the mid to distal anterior wall, septum,
apex and the entire inferior wall. There is no ventricular
septal defect. The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated
with borderline normal free wall function. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets
are mildly thickened. At least moderate (2+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
.
[**1-10**] Echo:
The left atrium is dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is
moderately dilated. There is an inferobasal left ventricular
aneurysm. A left ventricular mass/thrombus cannot be excluded.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed
with thinning and akinesis/aneurysm of the inferolateral wall
and akinesis of the mid to distal anterior septum, anterior wall
and apex. (LVEF= 20-25 %). Right ventricular chamber size and
free wall motion are normal. The aortic root is mildly dilated
at the sinus level. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic
regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse. Moderate (2+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity
of mitral regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.]
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: RV size and function appear normal. Severely reduced
LV systolic function with akinetic/aneurysmal inferolateral wall
and akinesis of the mid-LAD territory. There may be a thrombus
in the LV apex but this appearance may be due to near-field
artifact. IV echo contrast could not be used due to the
[**Hospital 228**] medical issues. A cardiac MR may help to clarify. At
least moderate mitral regurgitation, probably due to tethering
of the posterior mitral valve leaflet.
.
[**1-15**] MR [**Name13 (STitle) 2853**]:
The study is motion degraded. There is apparent fusion at C5-C6,
which is
likely post-surgical. No malalignment is noted. There is
increased signal
within the C6 vertebral body on both T1- and T2-weighted images,
which may
represent post-fusion sequela. There is no marrow edema on the
STIR images.
Axial images are markedly motion degraded.
At C4-C5, there appears to be a disc osteophyte complex with
mild central
stenosis and mild right and moderate left foraminal narrowing.
At C5-C6, there is mild bilateral foraminal narrowing, but no
significant
central stenosis.
At C6-C7, there is a disc osteophyte complex with mild central
stenosis and an indentation of the anterior thecal sac. There is
moderately severe left and moderate right foraminal narrowing.
At C7-T1, evaluation is limited.
IMPRESSION: Post-surgical changes as described. Additionally,
there are
spondylotic changes at C4-C5 and C6-C7 as detailed above.

Brief Hospital Course:
A 47 year-old man with advanced AIDS, CAD, [**Hospital 1902**] transferred from
OSH with respiratory failure, acute coronary syndrome.  Hospital
course by problem:
.
1. Respiratory distress/VAP/pulmonary embolism: Patient
transferred from outside hospital intubated due to respiratory
distress. Severe COPD on imaging and ventilator mechanics
continue to be consistent with obstructive disease.  Patie
