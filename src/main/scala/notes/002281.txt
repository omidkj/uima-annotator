CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Shortness of breath times four days.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 71 year-old male with
a history of coronary artery disease status post coronary
artery bypass graft and mitral valve prosthetic replacement,
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, who presents with
shortness of breath progressive over the past four days after
undergoing a transesophageal echocardiogram several days
prior to admission.  He denies orthopnea, reports increased
O2 requirement at home now.  Use to use it intermittently now
24 hours a day.  He also reports a chronic cough with yellow
sputum, which is mostly unchanged.  He denies fevers or
chills, nausea.  He has not slept well in the past couple of
nights, because he has been huffing and puffing.  He notes
that his chronic lower extremity edema is unchanged.  He
denies chest pain, palpitations, diaphoresis, nausea,
vomiting, rhinorrhea or sore throat.  He states his weight is
stable.  In the Emergency Department the patient received
Atrovent and Albuterol nebulizers times three, Solu-Medrol,
aspirin and Lasix 40 po.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Temperature 98.6.  Blood
pressure 122/54.  Heart rate 60.  Respiratory rate 26.
Oxygen saturation 99% on 2 liters.  General, this si a
pleasant elderly gentleman in mild respiratory distress who
can speak in full sentences.  HEENT anicteric sclera.  Mucous
membranes are moist.  Neck no LAD.  JVP 8 to 9 cm.
Cardiovascular regular rate and rhythm.  Normal S1 and S2
with a 2 out of 6 systolic murmur at the left lower sternal
border.  Chest decreased breath sounds on the right, diffuse
wheezes, increased expiratory phase.  Abdomen soft, nontender
with positive bowel sounds.  Liver edge is 2 cm below the
costal margin.  Extremities with 2 to 3+ pitting edema left
greater then right to the knees with good dorsalis pedis
pulses.  Neurological alert and oriented times three.  Pupils
are equal, round and reactive to light.  5 out of 5 strength
throughout and downgoing toes.

LABORATORIES ON ADMISSION:  White blood cell count 7.4,
hematocrit 33.1, platelets 100, sodium 142, potassium 5.0,
which was hemolyzed, BUN 25, creatinine 1.5, glucose 183.
Chest x-ray showed a right pleural effusion unchanged,
possibly a small left pleural effusion.  Electrocardiogram
showed sinus tachycardia with frequent premature atrial
contractions, left axis deviation of the right bundle branch
block and a left anterior vesicular block.  T wave inversions
in V1 and V2 all unchanged.

HOSPITAL COURSE ON THE MEDICINE [**Hospital1 **]:  1.  Chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease flare:  The patient was treated
with nebulizer and intravenous steroids.  Left ventricular
pseudoaneurysm with thrombus as noted on transesophageal
echocardiogram.  Anticoagulation was held, because of recent
gastrointestinal bleed.

2.  Mitral valvular regurgitation with mild paravalvular
leak:  CT surgery was consulted and they did not advise any
acute intervention.

3.  Coronary artery disease:  The patient did not have
evidence of ischemia by history or electrocardiogram, but he
was ruled out for a myocardial infarction by enzymes and he
was continued at this point on his aspirin and statin as
beta-blocker was held, because of his chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease flare.

4.  Carotid stenosis with left stent:  The patient was
continued on a baby aspirin, but [**Name (NI) **] was held, given the
history of gastrointestinal bleed.

On [**2193-4-10**] the patient developed the acute onset of chest pain
and shortness of breath with oxygen saturations in the 70s.
The patient was subsequently transferred to the Medical
Intensive Care Unit for management of his respiratory
failure.  This portion of his hospital course is detailed in
a separate discharge summary addendum.

HOSPITAL COURSE FROM DAY [**2193-4-29**] TO [**2193-5-2**]:  At this time
the patient is back on the Medicine Floor and his clinical
condition is improving.

1.  Anemia and blood loss:  As noted the patient had a
history of gastrointestinal bleed on anticoagulation in the
past and had a slew of heme positive stools, melena and
hematocrit drop, which required approximately one unit of
packed red blood cells per day for several days to maintain
his hematocrit above 28.  His stools became heme negative and
his blood count stabilized at approximately 32.  He underwent
esophagogastroduodenoscopy with push enteroscopy on [**2193-5-1**].
No clear source of his bleeding was found.  He was noted to
have significant chronic gastritis, but without acute
bleeding.  He was also noted to have a small red vessel in
his jejunum that was not currently bleeding.  No
interventions were undertaken.  GI's recommendation was that
if the patient continued to have a stable hematocrit over
time consideration could be given to restarting
anticoagulation with the risk that he may bleed again.  At
the time of discharge his hematocrit was stable at 32 and he
had a guaiac negative stool.

2.  Thrombocytopenia:  Stopping the Linezolid correlated with
improvement in the patient's platelet count up to 69 on the
day of discharge.  He had been restarted on his Nexium
several days before discharge and this did not seem to impact
his platelet counts.  It was felt that Linezolid was the
culprit.  It is expected that his platelet counts will
continue to rise over time.

3.  Atrial fibrillation:  As noted the patient had recurrent
atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate and
hypotension in the MICU.  He was continued on his Amiodarone
and Digoxin.  The Amiodarone was decreased from 400 b.i.d. to
300 b.i.d. on [**2193-5-1**].  He should continue on 300 b.i.d. for
a total of 14 days at which time he should be changed to 400
q.d. recommended for one month, but in fact the patient
should probably see his cardiologist before stopping this
dose of 400 q day.  He will continue on the Digoxin 0.125
q.d.  His Digoxin level had been stable at therapeutic range
at 1.2 as of a couple of days ago.  Beta-blocker is being
held at this time given the patient's chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease though since his flare seems to have
resolved one could consider restarting a beta-blocker in the
near future.  He is not anticoagulated at this time given his
risk of gastrointestinal bleeding, though he obviously
remains at risk for clot given his known left ventricular
thrombus, known left superficial femoral vein deep venous
thrombosis status post IVC filter and his atrial
fibrillation.

4.  Diarrhea:  Appears to have resolved at this time.  There
was hig
