History of Present Illness:
55 yo [**Male First Name (un) 4746**] with h/o hypocellular MDS presenting with GNR
bacteremia.  Patient was seen in clinic on the day prior to
admission and reported low grade temps as high as 100.4 with one
15" episode of shaking chills. In clinic his tmax was 100.7.
Blood cultures were drawn via PICC and peripherally. CXR done
done in clinic was improved since hospitalization. Patient
complained also of a productive cough of yellowish clear sputum
with rhinnorhea. PICC line was non-tender. Insertion site was
unchanged with slight erythema. Dose of iv vanco 1.25grams
given. He was restarted on clindamycin 450mg po tid, flagyl
500mg tid and bactrim 1 tab DS po bid. Patient also received one
bag of platelets for a count of 10. At midnight, the micro lab
reported the blood cultures grew GNR. The patient was called and
asked to come into the ED.


Past Medical History:
- Myelodysplastic syndrome:  MDS was diagnosed in [**6-/2180**] and
initially treated with danazol and aranesp. In [**6-/2181**] patient
was hospitalized for bilateral lung aspergillus infection and
enterobacter bacteremia. Port-o-cath placed [**8-/2181**] with three
subsequent hospitalizations for line infection, including
discharge [**2181-12-14**] with Staph epi infection. Most recent
admission was [**Date range (1) 34838**]/05 with pna and bacteremia
/Stenotrophomonus treated with a course of bactrim and
port-o-cath removal. During this course, pulmonary nodules were
visualized and the patient was treated empirically
w/voriconazole. Patient was most recently admitted [**2182-4-9**] to
[**2182-4-27**] with fevers and was found to have micrococcus and CNS in
his urine and blood. He went into respiratory distress. He was
discharged home on 2L of oxygen, flagyl, clindamycin and
vancomycin. These antibiotics were discontinued [**2182-5-3**] by his
oncologist. Patient was then maintained on voriconazole and
bactrim t.i.w. and vanco lock infusion.
- Prior hospitalization complicated by Afib
- Hypertension
- Remote history of kidney stones
- Hx Sweet's syndrome

      ENTEROBACTER CLOACAE.    FINAL SENSITIVITIES.
         Trimethoprim/sulfa sensitivity confirmed by
[**Doctor Last Name 3077**]-[**Doctor Last Name 3060**].
         This organism may develop resistance to third
generation
         cephalosporins during prolonged therapy. Therefore,
isolates that
         are initially susceptible may become resistant within
three to
         four days after initiation of therapy.  For serious
infections,
         repeat culture and sensitivity testing may therefore be
warranted
         if third generation cephalosporins were used.

Brief Hospital Course:
55 y/o M w/ MDS transforming into AML, neutropenic, presenting
with gram negative sepsis.
.
1. Sepsis. GNR 4/4 bottles from [**2182-5-21**]. Imipenem and Gent were
used to cover GNRs. High dose IV Bactrim was given for treatment
of possible stenotrophomonos, High dose vancomycin (1g tid due
to patient's high vanc metabolism) was given for micrococcus.
Pt given stress dose steroids as patient on chronic steroids at
home. Levophed prn for MAP>60.  UA neg, Urine cx neg, blood cx
neg after [**2182-5-21**]. PICC line sample from [**2182-5-24**] with GNRs,
possible source or was seeded, removed.  Pt discharged on
levofloxacin PO.
.
2. Hypotension: Likely [**1-16**] Sepsis, possible dehydration as ARF
was pre-renal. Initially received 11 L IVF. Also volume
repletion w/PRBC x 2 units.  Weaned off levophed after one day
in MICU.
.
3. Pancytopenia: Counts decreased from baseline, likely [**1-16**]
infection. Placed on neutropenic precautions, proph voriconizol
for aspergillosis, getting bactrim.  Received 2 units of PRBCs
and 1 bag of platellets in MICU and 1 bag before discharge.
.
4. Hypoxia: CXR showed pna and chf.  CXR findings consistent
with known recent pna.  hypoxia resolved after two days and Pt
was weaned of supplemental oxygen.
.
5. LE edema:  secondary to large IVF volume.  given lasix IV
prn.
