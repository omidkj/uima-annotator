altered mental status

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none


History of Present Illness:
82 year old female with significant PMH including DM type 2,
HTN, atrial fibrillation, CAD, COPD and pulmonary fibrosis who
is transferred from [**Hospital 1562**] Hospital for continued management
of [**Last Name (un) **], altered mental status, resolving sepsis and afib with
recent digoxin toxicity.
.
History was obtained from chart as patient is unable to provide
information.  She initially presented to [**Hospital 1562**] Hospital on
[**4-24**] with fever to 101, malaise and chills.  She was seen in the
ED there and was diagnosed with a UTI based on a mildly positive
UA.  She was put on Keflex PO for 2 days without improvement.
Urine culture showed mixed flora.  She re-presented with several
days of loose stool and continued fevers to 101 and chills.  She
denied any localizing symptoms, but did endorse anorexia for 5
days.
.
At [**Hospital1 1562**], she was found to have a pseudomonal UTI and
subequently developed hypotention, fever and presumed
pseudomonal urosepsis.  She was treated initially with
doxy/levaquin prior to culture, then with Cefepime which was
switched to Imipenem.  On the second day of hospitalization, she
developed acute respiratory failure requiring intubation and
transfer to the ICU. This was thought to likley be flash
pulmonary edema and cardiogenic in nature.  She required
pressors in the ICU and was extubated 6 days prior to transfer.
She did not require further pressors.  She was then transferred
to the medical floor.  She was found to be confused without
focal neurologic deficits and was seen by Neurology who felt
supportive care with MRI and possible EEG after stabilization
would be indicated.  She was also found to have an NSTEMI
thought to be demand related as well as rapid afib treated with
digoxin.  This led to junctional bradycardia which was treated
with digibind on the morning of transfer.  She also developed
acute renal failure with a peak creatinine of 3.8.  She was
treated with hydration.  Nephrology at OSH thought this was
likely ATN due to sepsis.  This has begun to improve.  She
additionally has had intermittent nausea and vomiting as well as
elevated lipase/amylase.  No source was found on abdominal US.
She had loose stools and a negative C. Diff x1; however, she was
empirically started on PO vancomycin.  And finally, she was
found to have swelling in her left arm after infiltration of an
IV and was found to have a DVT of L cephalic vein.  Given
thrombocytopenia, a HIT Ab was drawn which was equivocal and IgM
APLA was positive, she was started on an Argatroban drip.  She
was given 2 units prbcs for a low Hct at 23%.
.
On the floor, the patient is alert but not oriented.  She is
weak but able to follow simple commands.  She states she feels
weak but denies any pain.
.
Review of sytems: Patient is unable to provide.  Denies pain,
shortness of breath.  She does endorse weakness and malaise.

EKG:  Probable sinus tachycardia with atrial premature beats.
Left bundle-branch block. No previous tracing available for
comparison.

CHEST PORT. LINE PLACEMENT [**2131-5-5**]    IMPRESSION: PICC line at
right SVC/RA junction.

Cardiac Echo: Conclusions
The left atrium is dilated. A small secundum atrial septal
defect is present. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity
size are normal. There is mild regional left ventricular
systolic dysfunction with moderate to severe hypokinesis of the
inferior and inferolateral segments and of the mid to distal
lateral segments. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The diameters of aorta at the sinus,
ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is a trivial/physiologic
pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Mild focal LV systolic dysfunction consistent with
CAD (inferior ischemia/infarction). Mild mitral regurgitation.
Mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. Small secundum ASD.



Brief Hospital Course:
82 year old woman with PMH significant for HTN, DM type II, PVD,
CAD, [**Hospital 9215**] transferred from OSH for continued management of
hypertension, resolving sepsis, [**Last Name (un) **], afib with RVR and diarrhea.
