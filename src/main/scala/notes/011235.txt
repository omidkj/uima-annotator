History of Present Illness:
Pt is a 60M with history of cirrhosis [**3-4**] HCV c/b
encephalopathy, SBP, varices, PV thrombosis; DM; HTN presented
with dyspnea x 4 days and left sided chest pain and
back/shoulder pain, found to have large left sided pleural
effusions. Per records, patient fell ~ 2 weeks ago, no known
injury at that time. Had been fine after fall except for some
weakness, no other known traumas. Went to PCP today with 4 day

left sided large pleural effusion with possible loculation and
resolving hemothorax; also with patchy RML infiltrate that could
represent early PNA. Labs notable for HCT 24.2, INR 3.3,
creatinine 2.4. Recieved morphine 4 mg IV for pain, Levoquin 500
mg IV x 1 and Vitamin K 10 mg. Admitted to floor for further
management.

changes, rhinorrhea, congestion, sore throat, cough, abdominal
pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, BRBPR, melena,
hematochezia, dysuria, hematuria.

STUDIES:
ECHO [**2195-7-22**]
IMPRESSION:
Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved
regional and global biventricular systolic function. Moderate
pulmonary hypertension.

CT CHEST [**7-21**]
IMPRESION:
1. Multifocal pneumonia, progressed since [**7-16**], could be
bacterial, viral, eosinophilic or cryptogenic. 2. Moderate
residual of left pleural effusion, slightly smaller than on [**7-16**] following removal of the left pleural drain. Previous severe
atelectasis left lower lobe has improved. 3. Extensive
atherosclerosis, including coronaries. 4. Probable anemia.

CXR [**2195-7-14**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. New moderate left pleural effusion with associated
atelectasis.
2. Possible healing right anterior rib fractures. This can be
further
evaluated with dedicated radiographs if clinically indicated.

PLEURAL FLUID FOR CYTOLOGY:
Pleural fluid: NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.

CT CHEST [**2195-7-14**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. Large left pleural effusion, partially loculated, suggestive
of resolving hemothorax. Compressive atelectasis in the left
lower lobe. Scattered ground-glass opacities in the lungs likely
represent early pneumonia.
2. Cirrhotic liver with ascites. Portal hypertension with
splenomegaly.
3. Multiple bilateral rib fractures as detailed above.

CT CHEST [**2195-7-16**]:
IMPRESSION:

1. Interval decrease in the uppermost portion of the left-sided
effusion with improved aeration of the left upper lobe. Minimal
residual pleural effusion where Pleurex catheter terminates;
however, effusion is seen above and below the tip of the
catheter and may be due to loculation or catheter obstruction.
Near complete opacification of the left lower lobe.
2. Worsening multifocal parenchymal opacities. Given the
short-interval
progression, infection is most likely.
3. Anemia.
4. Findings compatible with cirrhosis and portal hypertension.
5. Cholelithiasis.

CXR [**2195-7-19**]:
IMPRESSION:
1) Slight difference in configuration of left chest tube. No
pneumothorax
detected.
2) Left base pleural fluid and underlying collapse and/or
consolidation
grossly stable.
3) Multifocal opacities in the right lung and left mid and upper
zones again seen.
