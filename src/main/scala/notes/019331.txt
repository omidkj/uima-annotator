Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 20146**]
Chief Complaint:
dyspnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Temporary Dialysis catheter placement


History of Present Illness:
76 yo woman with CKD (AV fistula placed on [**2147-4-13**]) but not yet
on dialysis, CAD, dCHF, extensive PVD and DM, who presents with
chief complaint of dyspnea for 3 days.  Patient notes
concominant cough, weight gain, lower extremity edema.  Also
reports pink-tinged sputum and occasional nausea.  She denies
fevers, chills, rhinorrhea, congestion or sick contacts.
.
Of note, patient had a recent admission for renal failure in the
setting of presumed infectious diarrhea.  She was evaluated for
dialysis during this admission but was felt this was not yet
necessary.  She was discharged off of her Valsartan (due to
renal failure) and Carvedilol (due to symptomatic bradycardia).
Since that admission, she saw her vascular surgeon who felt she
was retaining more fluid.  She also saw transplant surgery for
her fistula.  They felt it was maturing but not yet ready to use
for dialysis.
.
In the ED, initial VS: 98 87 120/70 24 99% RA (then down to 80s
in triage). Labs notable for creatinine 2.5, WBC 9.0, BNP [**Numeric Identifier 61448**],
INR 6.6. EKG: 1mm STD I, avl, v4-6, new vs prev. Posterior
didn't show ST elevations. Troponin 0.03. Cards consulted and
said: likely demand ischemia associated with CHF.   CXR shows
florid pulmonary edema, compatible with CHF.  U/A with >182 WBC.
Patient given 40 IV lasix urinated 450, and then given Zosyn.
Per report she is admitted to the MICU because when she turns on
her side, sats down to the 60s.  Then developed 100.6, 77 129/70
21 95% on 4L.

CXR: HISTORY: Volume overload.

FINDINGS: In comparison with study of [**5-13**], there is continued
and possibly even worsening florid pulmonary edema consistent
with severe CHF. Enlargement of the cardiac silhouette persists.
Bilateral pleural effusions are again seen.


Brief Hospital Course:
# Dyspnea: Patient with weight gain, lower extremity edema, CXR
consistent with volume overload, BNP elevated to >[**Numeric Identifier 7923**]
therefore likely acute on chronic dCHF exacerbation [**2-15**] stopping
carvedilol and Valsartan. PE unlikely with INR of 6.9.
Infectious unlikely as no fever or leukocytosis, no sick
contacts but could not rule out consolidation on CXR.  Patient
required intermittent bipap over the first 48 hours of
admission.  Also empirically treated for pneumonia with
Ceftriaxone and Azithromycin though this was stopped when the
patient remained afebrile without leukocytosis and repeat CXR
did not show any underlying infiltrate.  EC
