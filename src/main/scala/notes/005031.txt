Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 13024**]
Chief Complaint:
fever

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
44 y/o M with hx of HIV, scleraderma and IPF who presented to
the ER with sudden onset fevers and chills at 11am the morning
prior to admission.  He was in his usual state of health until
he started rigoring, had body aches, mild headache and a fever.
He has a cough at baseline that he says has not changed.  He has
no productive sputum.  His headache is mild and only started
once rigoring.  He denied photophobia, vision changes, neck
stiffness, weaknes, numbness or tingling in his extremities.
.
In the ED, initial vs were T 100.4, p 107, bp 111/67, r 16, 95%
on RA. Patient was given vanco 1 gm, ceftriaxone 2 gm, acyclovir
900 mg.  He had an LP that showed 3 WBCs with 10% polys, 90%
lymphs.  Glucose was 60, protein 38.  A head CT was normal.  He
was also given levofloxacin 750 mg and bactrim IV.  He had a
chest CT that showed progression of his ILD, and could not rule
out infiltrative process.
.
During his time in the ED, his blood pressure dropped.  He was
initially with SBPs in the 120s and then around 4 am after
breaking a fever to 101, his SBPs were in the 70s-80s.  He had
received about 3L at that time, and received another 3L NS with
a slight increase to SBPs in the 80s-90s.  Throughout his
hypotension, he was mentating and feeling well.  He did note
that his eyes turned red while in the ED with some watery
drainage.  No pus drainage, so pain, vision changes, or eye pain
with movement.  He is tachypneic, although asymptomatic.  This
is new for him.
.
Of note, he has just started bactrim two days ago and has taken
one pill.  He is compliant with his HIV meds and has been on
them for a long period of time.  There were no other new meds.
He does not know his most recent CD4 count.
.
On the floor, he continues to feel well without specific
complaints.

==========================
IMAGING:

CT CHEST:
CT CHEST WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: There is increase increase in
nodular opacities in both lung apices since [**2137-4-27**], concerning
for acute infectious etiology in this setting. There is an
overall progression of pre-existing fibrotic changes with
predominance in the lower lobes bilaterally and in the right
middle lobe. Post-surgical change is also seen in the right
middle lobe at a site of prior VATS, with suture material seen.
Traction bronchiectasis is again seen at both lung bases.
Extensive mediastinal lymphadenopathy is again seen, which also
appears
somewhat increased since [**2137-1-27**]. The pulmonary arterial
size is
borderline, but not changed since the prior study measuring 3.3
cm (2:26).  The esophagus demonstrates changes consistent with
known scleroderma. There is again thymic hypertrophy, unchanged.

Osseous structures appear unremarkable.
IMPRESSION:
1. Multiple findings related to known history pathologically
proven UIP in
the setting of progressive systemic sclerosis.
2. Right greater than left lung apex increase in nodular opacity
suggestive of superimposed acute infectious etiology.

CT HEAD:
FINDINGS: There is no acute intracranial hemorrhage, mass
effect, edema, or major vascular territorial infarct. The
ventricles and sulci are normal in size and configuration. There
is no shift of normally midline structures.  The [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white
matter differentiation is well preserved. The visualized
paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are clear. There is no
acute fracture.
IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial process.

CXR ([**2138-3-27**]) - IMPRESSION: Stable lower lobe interstitial lung
disease as previously described. Since the prior exam, there are
persistent bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left.
Please note, not mentioned above, there are chain sutures
identified in the lower right hemithorax consistent with prior
resection.

CXR ([**2138-3-28**]) - Bilateral opacities are present in both bases
which were not seen on the prior
chest x-ray of [**3-27**]. Bilateral effusions are present and the
overall pattern more suggests failure rather than pneumonia.

CXR ([**2138-3-29**]) - Increasing hazy opacification of the mid and
lower lungs, superimposed on chronic fibrotic changes in the
lung bases could be due to developing atypical infection. Early
follow-up is recommended.

CXR ([**2138-3-30**]) - IMPRESSION: Generalized clearing with persistent
chronic changes.

Brief Hospital Course:
44 y/o M with hx of HIV, systemic scleroderma, ILD with UIP and
hypothyroidism who presents with fevers, rigors admitted to the
MICU for hypotension

#HYPOTENSION: He was found to be hypotensive in the Emergency
Department with SBPs in the 70s with limited improvement to
fluid boluses and so was transferred to the MICU for further
management. The hypotension was thought to be due to a
distributive process due to concern for infection. In the ICU,
he remained hemodynamically stable off vasopressors, with
intermittent episodes of hypotension that responded to fluid
boluses. Once called out the floor, the patient did not have any
further hypotensive episodes.

# FEVER: There was concern for an infectious process in this
immune compromised patient. The only localizing symptom was a
chronic cough.  Chest CT was concerning for pulmonary process
although difficult to interpret in the setting of his ILD.
