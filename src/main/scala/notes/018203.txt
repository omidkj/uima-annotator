Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was taken emergently to the operating room for
repair of aortic disruption (see operative note for details).
Postoperative TEE showed the thoracic aortic stent graft in good
placement with no aortic disruption visualized. The patient was
taken to the CSRU for immediate post-op care. He was transferred
to the Trauma ICU on post op day one. A CT scan of the head
showed foci of intraventricular hemorrhage within the posterior
horns of the lateral ventricles bilaterally. There were no
c-spine fractures identified on imaging. Fractures of the right
1st rib and left 4th, 5th, and 12th ribs were seen as well as
left transverse processes of T1 and T2. Neurosurgery,
ortho-spine, vascular, and trauma surgery teams followed the
patient's progress. The patient developed new onset atrial
fibrillation and was treated with Amiodarone. He developed
increasing O2 requirements requiring increased ventilatory
support. He also developed a fever and underwent a fever workup
while starting empiric antibiotic treatment. His neurologic
status did not improve, and a neurology consult was obtained.
The neurological consult impression was that MRI findings and
clinical exam could be consistent with diffuse axonal injury.
The patient remained in a comatose state. Attending physician,
[**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], had extensive discussions with the patient's
two sons who decided to withdraw care in accordance with the
patient's advance directive. On hospital day 8, the patient was
made "comfort measures only" as agreed upon by his two sons and
attending physician. [**Name10 (NameIs) **] patient expired at 1:30am on hospital
day 9.
