IMAGING:
* Chest CT [**2125-4-28**]: A 1.3 x 1.6 cm left upper lobe nodule is
re-demonstrated, abutting a left rib without causing cortical
breakthrough. Throughout the lungs are multiple cysts, mostly
peripherally based in the lateral lobes and apparent
honeycombing adjacent pattern although this may also represent
pneumonia in emphysematous lung. In the right lower lobe, there
is a spiculated focus of increased opacification. There are
small bilateral pleural effusions. There are prominent
prevascular nodes measuring to 9 mm in short axis dimension.
Subcarinal nodes are enlarged at 1.5 cm maximal short axis
diameter. A paratracheal node measures to 1.7 cm, and bilateral
hilar nodes are also noted, most on the left. Heart and great
vessels are essentially unremarkable excepting for vascular
calcifications and some atherosclerosis. There is a central line
with its tip terminating in the mid-to-lower SVC. The visualized
abdomen, the spleen, liver, and adrenals appears are normal. The
pancreas is atrophic. There is a 5.2 cm low-attenuation cystic
lesion in the right kidney. Again seen is a moderate hiatal
hernia.
.
* CXR: The patient has known emphysema and interstitial lung
disease. As best can be determined, without comparison x-ray at
this institution, there is a superimposed process. Given the
underlying emphysema, edema may assume atypical configuration
and the overall appearance may be due to failure. However, the
more confluent areas particularly in the lingula in left lower
lobe raise the concern for possible pneumonia as well.
.
* PET scan [**4-24**]:
1. 13 mm nodule in the left upper lobe with SUV of 5.5
representing known lung cancer, with multiple mediastinal nodes
with FDG avidity as described above.
2. A focal uptake in the left nasopharynx with SUV of 11.2 of
unknown significance, for which clinical correlation and
possible direct visualization is recommended.
3. A focal area of FDG uptake with the SUV of 5.4 in the
vertebral body of T8 without CT correlate, suspicious for
metastasis. 4. Bilateral peripheral parenchymal opacities with
cystic changes and
bronchiolectasis with the SUV ranging from 3.7-5.5, likely due
to interstitial lung disease such as drug related lung disease
with inflammatory activity. Superimposed infection cannot be
totally excluded and clinical correlation is recommended.
5. Uptake in the left proximal femur is noted with the SUV of
2.8, representing known metastasis, proven on biopsy.
.
Cytology lefet femur [**2125-3-8**] - POSITIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS
(consistent with metastatic adenocarcinoma).
.
Pathology L fever - [**3-8**] - Metastatic, poorly-differentiated
carcinoma with focal necrosis (This immunophenotype is
compatible with a lung origin and raises the possibility of a
poorly differentiated squamous carcinoma or large cell
neuroendocrine carcinoma.)
.
TTE [**2125-4-26**]:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity is mildly
dilated. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall
motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Tissue
Doppler imaging suggests a normal left ventricular filling
pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). The right ventricular cavity is mildly
dilated with normal free wall contractility. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion. There is an
anterior space which most likely represents a fat pad.
IMPRESSION: Mild biventricular cavity dilation with grossly
preserved biventricular systolic function. Moderate pulmonary
hypertension.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 14887**] was a 70-year-old man with likely non-small-cell lung
cancer with metastasis in left femur, status cycle 2 of
carboplatin and paclitaxel on [**2125-4-12**], who was admitted after
fainting in his oncologist's office with hypotension.
.
# Pneumonia with septic shock: The patient had SBP in the 70s on
admission and was admitted to the ICU. Chest imaging studies
revealed bilateral honeycombing pattern, concerning for
pneumonia in the setting of emphysematous lungs versus pulmonary
fibrosis. His BP quickly stabilized after IVF, initiation of
antibiotics, and discontinuation of furosemide. His sputum
culture was negative. Urine Legionella antigen was negative. He
was started on cefepime and azithromycin but spiked a fever, and
vancomycin was added. He quickly defervesced. Pulmonary was
consulted and thought that a bronchoscopy was not indicated at
this time. There was a concern for a chronic underlying lung
dise
