CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2133-3-14**] 12:10 AM

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST

Reason: please assess for bleed

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
[**Age over 90 **] yo M presents with weakness. found to be in afib.
anticoagulated INR 12
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
please assess for bleed
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: creat

INDICATION: [**Age over 90 **]-year-old male with weakness and AFib with an INR
of 12.

COMPARISON: [**2133-3-2**].

TECHNIQUE: Non-contrast head CT.

FINDINGS: There is no hemorrhage, edema, mass effect,
hydrocephalus, or evidence of acute vascular territorial
infarct. The ventricular and sulcal prominence remains
unchanged. Hypodensities in the external capsule bilaterally are
stable and suggestive of lacunar infarct. The osseous structures
demonstrate no fractures. There is mucosal thickening within
multiple ethmoid air cells, the frontal air cells, as well as
maxillary sinuses with an 8-mm retention cyst in the left
maxillary sinus. The middle ear cavities and mastoid air cells
are clear. The soft tissues are unremarkable.

IMPRESSION: No hemorrhage or mass effect.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)

Reason: chf, pna

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
[**Age over 90 **] year old man with tachy, wide compl, rales
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:

CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON [**2133-3-13**]

Compared with prior study from [**2132-1-20**].

CLINICAL HISTORY: [**Age over 90 **]-year-old man with tachycardia, rales,
evaluate for CHF or pneumonia.

FINDINGS: Portable upright chest radiograph is obtained. Midline
sternotomy wires are again noted as is the dual-lead right chest
pacemaker with lead tips in the proximal location of the right
atrium and right ventricle. The patient is slightly rotated to
the left, which somewhat limits evaluation. The
cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable with mild cardiac
enlargement again noted. There is a layering left pleural
effusion noted. Bibasilar atelectatic changes are noted as well.
There is no overt CHF. No definite pneumothorax is seen,
although the patient's chin overlies the left lung apex,
somewhat limiting evaluation. The visualized osseous structures
appear stable and intact.

IMPRESSION:

1. Stable cardiomegaly with left pleural effusion and bibasilar
atelectasis.
.
Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and
intraventricular
conduction defect with secondary ST-T wave abnormalities.
Compared to the
previous tracing of [**2131-12-28**] atrial fibrillation is new.

.
The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right atrium is
markedly dilated. The estimated right atrial pressure is
10-20mmHg. There is moderate symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. There
is severe global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 25-30 %).
Right ventricular chamber size is normal. with mild global free
wall hypokinesis. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. A
bioprosthetic aortic valve prosthesis is present. The aortic
valve prosthesis has normal transvalvular gradients. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is severe mitral
annular calcification. There is a minimally increased gradient
consistent with trivial mitral stenosis. Trivial mitral
regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity
of mitral regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.]
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is mild
estimated pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2132-1-17**],
biventricular function is worse and the trans-aortic gradient
has decreased,
