History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 86245**] is a 37 year old lady transferred from [**Hospital1 5979**] because of a supraventricular tachycardia that has
developed in the setting of allergic rhinitis/URI/asthma
(unclear diagnosis per records). The patient reports that she
developed an asthma exacerbation/cough prior to admission which
triggered an episode of tachycardia which was self limited.
Later that evening, she developed a second episode of slower
tachycardia with chest pressure and presented to the ED.
.
At the [**Hospital3 **] ER, the patient was found in to have
tachycardia at a rate of 203, given Adenosine and converted back
to Normal sinus rhythm. On arrival to their medical floor, VS:
98.0 90/58 82 13 96% RA. An echo was performed, but no result is
included. She developed one episode of tachycardia after
xopenex/albuterol, after which she was started on Verapamil for
rate control. She was maintained on certirizine/prednisone with
Flovent started for what appears to be an asthma exacerbation.
The decision was made to transfer to [**Hospital1 18**] for an EP work up.
.
On arrival to the floor, the patient feels well and is without
complaint. She corroborates the story above. She is quite
concerned about details of the procedure, and also about
alternatives to blood transfusions as she is a Jehovah's
witness. She denies any chest pain or dyspnea at this time.
.
On review of systems, she denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.

Brief Hospital Course:
37yoF w/ WPW s/p ablation who presents to CCU in the setting of
questionable anaphylaxis secondary to protamine reversal
following procedure.
.
# Allergic reaction to protamine. Acute onset in EP lab with SOB
and skin flushing, noted immediately after protamine given. Pt
was treated with epinephrine, solumedrol and benedryl. She was
monitored in the CCU overnight after reaction and did not have
any reoccurance of symptoms. She was discharged with 40 mg
prednisone for total of 5 days, Famotidine x 5 days and Benedryl
prn.
.
# SVT/WPW s/p ablation: Patient now back in NSR. Was tachycardic
to 110-120's with strenuous activity but has not tolerated nodal
agents in the past (self-d.c'ed) so none were started at
discharge. Pt instructed to call her cardiologist if she
experiences palpitations, light headedness or any similar
symptoms. Had some bleeding from right groin follow
catheterization and vagal reaction with sheath removal. Right
groins with moderate hematoma, Left with mild hematoma, stable
on d/c with some tenderness. Given aspirin allergy, pt was
started on Plavix every day for one month s/p ablation. She was
given a cane to ambulate by PT because her groin was tender and
she had old right knee pain.
.
# Asthma/Allergic Rhinitis: Albuterol and Xopenex appeared to
aggrevate SVT. Pt was started on Flovent inhaler [**Hospital1 **] and
continued on Claritin. Pt was told to avoid Albuterol until
after she sees her cardiologist. On day of discharge, she has
mild wheezes and cough but no evidence of infection or
respiratory distress. Tol activity on RA with stable O2 sats.

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to the hospital because of an episode of
tachycardia, fast heart rate.  You underwent an
electrophysiologic study and bypass tract ablation.  While you
were here you had some tachycardia so you were restarted on
Metoprolol to control your heart
.
You did have an allergic reaction to a medicine called protamine
during your procedure.  You received epinephrine and other
medicines to treat the reaction.  You were watched in the ICU
