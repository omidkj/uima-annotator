HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted on [**2120-3-26**], taken
directly to the Operating Room where a craniotomy and
clipping of his left MCA aneurysm was performed.  The patient
was sent to the Intensive Care Unit postoperatively for close
observation.

As the patient began to wake up it was evident that the
patient had developed a postoperative aphasia.  The patient
was treated with dexamethasone as well as Dilantin
postoperatively.  The patient did well postoperatively with
the exception of his aphasia for which the patient stayed in
the ICU for some time in an attempt to discern the cause and
be alert for other possible problems.

Over the course of the stay, the patient was placed on
high-dose intravenous fluids in order to increase his blood
pressure which subsequently improved his aphasia.  It was,
therefore, determined that a higher blood pressure would aid
in maintaining better blood flow to his brain speech centers.

Once determined the patient was found to be stable and the
aphasia improving, the patient was discharged to the regular
Neurosurgical Floor where he continued to do well.  During
the course of his stay, his mental status examination and
physical examination continued to be very good.  His aphasia
continued to improve.

The patient was slowly weaned off of his IV fluids which he
tolerated well.  Periodically, over the course of his
weaning, his blood pressure would become slightly lower.  For
that reason, his blood pressure medication regimen was
altered such that he will only be taking only one-quarter of
his at-home Atenolol dose on discharge.

On [**2120-3-28**], the patient had an angiogram to ensure
appropriate patency of his cranial arteries which was
confirmed. The patient did have mild narrowing of his MCA,
although patency was evident.

It is now [**2120-4-2**], and the patient is doing quite well.  He
is being discharged home.  He will be sent home with Percocet
for pain, Colace for constipation.  He will be sent home with
Dilantin 100 mg t.i.d. as well as Atenolol 6.25 mg once a
day.  The patient is not to restart his home medications as
they include blood thinners and hypertensive medications.  He
is to restrict himself to the medications that he is being
discharged on.

Before discharge, he will have his staples removed.  He is to
follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1132**] in one week.  He may observe regular
activity, although he should not drive while on pain
medication.  The patient may start showering tomorrow.
