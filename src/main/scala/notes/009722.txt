History of Present Illness:
30 y/o M with PMH treated malaria [**2137**] now presents with 1 day
history of midsternal chest pain, intense, nonradiating, rated
[**10-8**] in intensity.  Chest pain was associated with shortness of

lying down and improved with sitting up/leaning forward.  Pt
took tylenol x 2 at home with some improvement in symptoms.
Then presented to the ED for further evaluation.

days ago.  Denies BRBPR, no melena, no weakness, no easy
bruising, no cough or nasal congestion, no dysuria.  Last travel

friend noticed diffuse maculopapular rash on bilateral upper
extremities, trunk, lower extremities yesterday which has since
resolved except for mild rash on left shoulder today.

In ED, EKG with diffuse ST elevations throughout precordium and
inferior leads and BP initially 60/palp.  STAT echo by
cardiology showed no pericardial effusion, no gross [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] 50%.

Brief Hospital Course:
30 yo male with admitted with meningococcemia/shock, with 21 day
MICU stay and complicated hospital course:

1.)Shock -- Pt went into shock intially requiring [**4-1**] pressors
shortly after admission - with septic and cardiogenic
components. [**4-3**] blood culture bottles grew gram negative
diplococci which were identified as meningococci. He was treated
with ceftraixone and vancomycin for a total of 10 days. Several
days after admission he was found to have developed a
pericardial effusion, and developed atrial flutter. He has been
stable of pressors since hospital day 6. The flutter has also
resolved (see below).

2.) Atrial flutter -- During his MICU stay he developed atrial
flutter likely secondary to his pericardial effusion. He did not
convert with DC coardioversion. Initially he required a
diltiazem drip, and was transitioned to po diltiazem at 90mg
QID. One time after leaving the MICO the patients rate went up
to the 150's/160's and he required 15mg IV diltiazem to slow his
rate. Of note: his rate was not very responsive to IV beta
blockers. He spontaneously converted to NSR on 6?30?05, and has
been stable in sinus rhythm at a rate of 80's - 100's since,
still on the po diltiazem. He was not anticoagulated during his
aflutter becasue he was in DIC, and had an INR > 2.0. He is now
on aspirin 325 daily per cardiology recommendations. He was
followed by cardiology throughout his stay.

3.)Depressed EF -- On admission he was found to have a markedly
reduced EF. As it was global in nature, this was probably from
severe metabolic derangements. He greatly improved on dobutamine
and has now been weaned off. Repeat echo's show EF of 50-55%.

4.)Pericardial effusion -- several days after admission he was
found to have developed a pericardial effusion. The was drained
in the OR by thoracic surgery, and he is s/p pericardial window
and chest tube. The chest tube was removed [**2140-7-27**] since it was
draingin less than 100cc/24 hour period. The patient developed a
small L sideed pneumothorax, which is resolving, and a
pneumomediastinum, which is fully resolved. He also has a left
pleural effusion which has enlarged slightly since removal of
his chest tube. He is continuing to dran a small-moderate amount
of fluid to the bandage at his chest tube site.

5.)Respiratory failure -- Hypoxemic, Initially from volume/pulm
edema, ? of early ARDS, DIC obstructing pulmonary vasculature.
Intubated on admission, and extubated [**2140-7-23**]. Now breathing
well, with good oxygen saturation on room air, no shortness of
breath.

6.)ARF -- Likely from ATN secondary to hypoperfusion/shock.
Creatinine was 2.3 on admission, peaked at 7.8 on [**2140-7-18**], and
is 1.5 on discharge. Pt was initially treated with CVVH,
transitioned to intermittant hemodialysis, and off HD altogether
as of [**2140-7-25**]. His urine output has been excellent, and he has
had no trouble voiding without a foley catheter. Pt also had
hyperphosphatemia; now resolved. Renal followed him throughou
