Chief Complaint:
Fatigue

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
DC cardioversion
EGD


History of Present Illness:
This is an 87 y/o female with significant medical history of
paroxysmal atrial fibrillation s/p cardioversion in [**2138**],
tricuspid regurgitation and right sided heart failure p/w
lightheadness with movement, nausea and fatigue in setting of
INR of 9.7 and ARF. Patient has had these symptoms for the past
3-4 days and noted to be dyspneic after walking [**12-27**] steps.

The patient was recently admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2141-12-7**]
with initial presentation with lightheadedness, dizziness, and
nausea and was found to be in atrial fibrillation with rapid
ventricular response. Initial plans for TEE and cardioversion
could not be done as she was unable to swallow the TEE probe.
Plan was to rate control, maintain INR > 2 for a month and
cardiovert.

Diltiazem was added 120 mg daily and metoprolol was increased
from 75 [**Hospital1 **] to 100 [**Hospital1 **]. The night of her discharge she was noted
to feel more tired per her daughter. She progressively became
more tired with decreased PO in setting of nausea through the
course of the week, worse in the past 3-4 days. Noted to have
decreased uop at home. She denies
cp/palpitations/orthopnea/PND/fevers/chills. Came to the ED for
further evaluation.

In the ED, initial vitals were T 97.3 HR 74 BP 96/62 RR 18 O2:
80% RA (per report this was a poor pleth and patient without any
respiratory distress). She was found to have an elevated INR of
9.7 and was given 5mg PO vitamin K. Found to have BNP of 2508.
As well as ASA 325mg. CXR showed no pulmonary edema and no
evidence of inflitrate. Bedside echo showed no evidence of
pericardial effusion. Vitals prior to discharge were 97.5 HR 71,
BP 109/80 RR 12 98% on 4L
.
On the floor, patient triggered for hypoxia O2sats in low 80s on
RA and bp 84/61. Patient appeared quite volume down. She was
given IVF boluses that apparently showed some degree of fluid
responsiveness to sbp 91. However, after 2 liters bp continued
to drift back down to sbp in the low 80s. She was given a total
of 4 liters NS with minimal UOP. Her bp ultimately increased to
sbp of 104.

another required a pacemaker for unknown reason.

Brief Hospital Course:
This is an 87 year old female with history of Afib w/RVR
awaiting DC cardioversion as  outpatient, right heart failure in
setting of severe tricuspid regurgitation presented with
malaise, nausea/anorexia, hypotension (sbp's in the 80s),
bradycardia to the 50s on multiple nodal agents, and
intermittent hypoxia.

HYPOXIA: Patient initially presented intermittently hypoxic that
did not correct with oxygen. Her hypoxia was exacerbated by her
initial presentation with hypotension with systolic blood
pressures in the 80s in setting of recent addition of multiple
nodal agents. Patient had a recent increase in her home
metoprolol from 75 [**Hospital1 **] to 100 [**Hospital1 **] and new addition of diltiazem
(120 mg daily) all in the setting of new afib with RVR. With
history of severe right heart failure and addition of IV fluids
to help correct her hypotension, the overall increase in right
heart pressures with low systemic blood pressures caused an
ideal setting for a significant right to left shunt.

An echocardiogram was performed with bubble study that showed a
patent foramen ovale causing this right to left shunt that
ultimately was thought to be the cause of her intermittent
hypoxia. Her hypoxia was corrected with positional changes and
maneuvers, such as valsalva, to decrease venous return and
minimize the shunt. She was slowly and gently diuresed to
decrease her right sided pressures and midodrine was added to
increase her left sided pressures. Her hemodynamics improved
considerably and she was no longer hypoxic.

PFO closure was planned. Patient was admitted with an elevated
INR of 10.8, thought secondary to poor nutrition. Coumadin was
held during admission and her INR slowly drifted down to 5.0.
Since it was not drifting down as quickly as was desired to
perform this procedure, she was given 5 mg of Vitamin K. Her INR
normalized to 1.5. She was started on Heparin drip in setting of
recent cardioversion approximately five days prior until her PFO
closure.

 In the setting of supratherapeutic PTTs the patient developed
several melanotic stools. Her hematocrit dropped from 41.1 to
31.6 in 24 hours. Her heparin drip was stopped and GI was
consulted. Her hematocrit stabilized in the low 30s and she did
not need a blood transfusion. Since she will need
anti-coagulation in the future, it was felt that an EGD should
be performed during this admission.  Her EGD showed erosive
gastritis,  two cratered 10-15 mm ulcers in the duodenal bulb.
Both ulcers had evidence of a visible vessel which were not
actively bleeding. These ulcers were cauterized with no further
signs of active bleeding. She was continued on pantoprazole 40
mg [**Hospital1 **] and she was empirically started on H.pylori treatment.
Given her high risk of stroke post-cardioversion she was
re-started on coumadin 24 hours post EGD. She was closely
monitored and had no signs of bleeding. She was discharged with
close INR and Hematocrit follow up with her PCP.

HYPOTENSION: Felt to be secondary to anorexia and nausea for
several days prior to admission in setting of increasing
metoprolol and adding diltiazem. Most likely the loss of the
right atrial "kick" and known RV dysfunction meant that she was
not able to move fluids through the pulmonary system and back to
the right atrium. She was maintained on midodrine prn sbp <130.
She remained normotensive through remainder of admission.

ACUTE ON CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE: Peaked to 2.6 on admission. It
was felt it was secondary to pre-renal etiology given prolonged
hypotension prior to admission. Once hemodynamics improved,
renal function improved as well. Creatinine on discharge was
1.4. Further follow up should be performed in the outpatient
with her PCP next week.

PAROXYSMAL ATRIAL FIBRILLATION: History of PAF with DCCV in
[**2138**]. Reportedly has been in sinus until [**12-3**] where she was
admitted for afib with RVR. Patient was planned to have an
outpatient DC cardioversion after 3 weeks of anticoagulation,
but subsequently was admitted. After her blood pressure and
hypoxia was corrected the patient had a DC cardioversion during
this admission. She was subsequently started on Dronedarone. It
was felt amiodarone
