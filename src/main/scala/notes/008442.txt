Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 8487**]
Chief Complaint:
Hemoptysis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
47 yo previously healthy female beyond h/o aspergillosis in
[**2158**], treated with antimicrobials for at least one year by an
infectious disease doctor [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 12017**], NH (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]. She
reports she has been feeling very well since then, however
developed cough approx 11 days ago. She reports daily episodes
of a small amt of bloody sputum upon waking up in the morning,
but denies associated sx of fevers/chills, no brown/yellow
sputum, no SOB, no chest pain. She further denies other URI sx
and she denies sick contactss. She has been able to do a cardio
workout at the gym without difficulty. She called her ID doctor
who treated for aspergillus upon onset of her hemoptysis. He
recommended going to the ER for further evaluation, however she
was concerned about inability to afford the copay for ED visit.
Instead she provided sputum samples that apparently couldn't be
processed because she did not refrigerate them.
.
Last night, she reports a coughing fit w/ more substantial
episode of hemoptysis at home (perhaps half cup of bright red
blood). She presented to [**Hospital 8641**] Hospital and coughed up 100cc of
hemoptysis per report. Otherwise she nauseated all day due to
anxiety, no vomiting. Review of systems otherwise negative.
.
Of note, she reports multiple respiratory infections as child
and through adulthood requiring antibiotics at least once yearly
(sometimes extended courses d/t unsuccessful 1st course of rx).
She does not have asthma. She denies any weight loss, fevers,
night sweats. She denies rashes. UOP has been normal, nonbloody,
not foamy. She has had multiple industrial exposures and reports
she previously worked in factory making test tubes of
fiberglass. Ovens used there contained asbestos, but she reports
she always wore appropriate protective mask/respirator whenever
required at work. For the last 3 years, she has worked in a
factory making computer chips with the chemical thixotropic. She
denies TB risk factors including no travel, incarceration,
homelessness, contacts. PPD was placed 4 years ago in the
setting of hemoptysis and reportedly was negative.
.
She reports that 4 years ago she developed hemoptysis in the
setting of "lung congestion". She underwent bronchoscopy at that
time and reports MDs were initially concerned for TB; tests
however came back negative for this. PPD and HIV reportedly
negative at that time. It was at that time that she was
diagnosed instead with pulmonary aspergillosis. She says that
she was followed by ID in [**Location (un) 12017**] and reports having taken 7
pills daily for a year, but she is unsure of the medication
names. As above, she reports she has been doing well since then.

.
In the ED, her VS were T: 98.0 BP 145/85 HR 70 RR 17 O2sat 98%.
A pulmonology c/s was requensted in the ED. PPD placed in R
forearm. CT chest showed a cavitating lesion measuring 1.4 cm
with thick walls consistent with possible fungal infection. Labs
revealed a normal hct and normal renal function. She was in no
respiratory distress.
.
ROS: The patient denies any fevers, chills, weight change,
+nausea and poor appetite in setting of anxiety with hemoptysis,
no vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, constipation, melena,
hematochezia, steatorrhea, chest pain, shortness of breath,
orthopnea, PND, lower extremity edema, cough, urinary frequency,
urgency, dysuria, lightheadedness, gait unsteadiness, focal
weakness, vision changes, headache, rash or skin changes.

   GRAM STAIN (Final [**2162-12-3**]):
      <10 PMNs and <10 epithelial cells/100X field.
      2+   (1-5 per 1000X FIELD):   MULTIPLE ORGANISMS
CONSISTENT WITH
                                    OROPHARYNGEAL FLORA.
      QUALITY OF SPECIMEN CANNOT BE ASSESSED.

      SPARSE GROWTH OROPHARYNGEAL FLORA.
      ASPERGILLUS FUMIGATUS.

   FUNGAL CULTURE (Preliminary):

   ACID FAST SMEAR (Final [**2162-12-4**]):
      NO ACID FAST BACILLI SEEN ON DIRECT SMEAR.
      This is only a PRELIMINARY result.  If ruling out
tuberculosis, you
      must wait for confirmation by concentrated smear.
      DUE TO DUPLICATE SPECIMEN concentrated smear not
available.

   ACID FAST CULTURE (Final [**2162-12-4**]):

      SPECIMEN COMBINED WITH SAMPLE # 261-2492V, [**2162-12-3**].
      MULTIPLE SPECIMENS COLLECTED ON DIFFERENT DAYS ARE

[**2162-12-2**] CTA chest:
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism within a segmental or large
subsegmental branch.
2. Scattered centrilobular nodules, with bronchiectasis in the
left lower
lobe and lingula. These findings can be consistent with
aspergillus
infection. Although there is no convincing evidence for invasive

aspergillosis, the presence of nodules suggest an active
endobronchial
process, and developing mycetomas within bronchiectatic segments
cannot be
excluded, particularly in the left base (3:82).



Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 42210**] is a 47 yo female with hx of treated aspergillosis
[**2158**] who presents now with hemoptysis.
.
# Hemoptysis: Upon admission to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] the source was almost
certainly pulmonary based on CT findings. Pt w/ hx of
aspergillosis, mycobacterium scofulaceum with unknown risk
factors. Cavitary lesion on CT scan may be consistent with
recurrence of aspergillosis, m. scofulaceum  also w/
bronchiecta
