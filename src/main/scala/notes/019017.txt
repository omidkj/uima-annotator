Pertinent Results:
CTA ABD W&W/O C & RECONS  [**2190-4-4**] 1:00 PM
IMPRESSION:
1. There is a 7.3 cm x 7.5 cm contained hematoma within the
surgical bed of recent appendectomy, just inferior to the suture
line. There is a hematocrit effect indicating recent bleed
without evidence of active extravasation.
2. Moderate amount of high density free fluid within the abdomen
and pelvis, suggesting intra-peritoneal extension of the bleed
into the abdomen and pelvis.
3. Airspace opacity within the lingula consistent with pneumonia
or atelectasis.
4. Small right pleural effusion with associated relaxation
atelectasis.
5. Multiple compression fractures within the spine with
post-vertebroplasty changes at L1, L3, and L5. These fractures
are old and no evidence of acute fracture is identified.

CT CHEST W/CONTRAST  [**2190-4-5**] 2:24 PM
IMPRESSION:
1. Simple-appearing right pleural effusion with adjacent
atelectasis, without evidence of hemorrhage or enhancement.
2. Persistent hemorrhagic ascites around the liver and spleen.
3. Hypodensities within the kidneys seen bilaterally, better
characterized on the prior multiphasic study from [**2190-4-4**].
.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2190-4-6**] 8:36 AM
CONCLUSION: Relatively stable appearance as compared to
yesterday. No pneumothorax.
.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2190-4-14**] 3:19 PM
IMPRESSION: Increased right pleural effusion and adjacent
opacity representing atelectasis and/or consolidation. Interval
increase in the left retrocardiac opacity and left pleural
effusion as well.
.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2190-4-16**] 9:48 AM
SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW OF THE CHEST: When compared to prior
study performed the day before, there has been mild interval
increase in moderate right pleural effusion and associated right
lower lobe atelectasis. Three right chest tubes remain in place.
There has been interval improvement with better aeration of the
left lower lobe. There is no pneumothorax. Cardiomediastinal
contour is unchanged with right cardiac border obscured by
pleural and lung abnormalities. Pacemaker leads in unchanged
position. NG tube tip is in the stomach.
.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2190-4-21**] 5:45 PM
IMPRESSION:
1. Probable small increase in size of right-sided pleural
effusion with increased right lower lobe
atelectasis/consolidation.
2. Stable appearance to retrocardiac opacity and lines and
tubes.
3. Small left apical lucency is likely related to technical
artifact from lordotic view with pneumothorax felt unlikely.
This may be reevaluated on followup radiographs. If there is
clinical concern, a repeat radiograph may be obtained sooner.
Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] was paged at approximately 6:30 to discuss these
findings.
.
CT CHEST W/O CONTRAST  [**2190-4-23**] 1:30 PM
IMPRESSION:
1) Previously seen right loculated effusion. This has been
evacuated, and there are tiny bilateral pleural effusions
present. Consolidation in the right lower lobe has progressed as
has the consolidation in the left lower lobe.
2) Right upper extremity fat containing mass inadequately
assessed on this study.
.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2190-4-26**] 9:59 PM
IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**4-20**] through 5:
Mild pulmonary edema has worsened and small bilateral pleural
effusions, right greater than left, have increased since [**4-22**]. Heart size top normal. No pneumothorax. New tracheostomy tube
abuts the lateral wall of the trachea and should be evaluated
clinically. Tip of a right jugular line projects over the
superior cavoatrial junction. Patient has had median sternotomy
and at least a mitral valve replacement. Transvenous right
atrial and right ventricular pacer leads are continuous from the
left axillary pacemaker and unchanged. No pneumothorax.
.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2190-4-29**] 8:58 AM
INDICATION: Status post right-sided VATS procedure.
AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in
semi-upright position, and analysis is performed in direct
comparison with a similar study dated [**2190-4-27**]. Status
post sternotomy and aortic valve replacement as before.
Permanent pacer with dual electrode system in unchanged
position. Tracheostomy cannula in place. Pulmonary vasculature
with bilateral considerable perivascular haze and diffuse
densities on the bases consistent with bilateral pleural
effusions. No significant interval change is identified during
the recent examination interval [**4-27**] through [**4-29**].

Brief Hospital Course:
He was admitted on [**2190-4-4**] and he was transfused 3 FFP and 1
unit PRBC, and 10mg Vit K.

Resp: On CT, he was noted to have right sided pleural effusion
with associated relaxation atelectasis. On [**4-5**], he had a
increasing moderate size pleural effusion and he had a US guided
tap for ~400cc fluid. He received Lasix for the effusion with
good effect.
Thoracic Surgery then placed a CT on the right side for the
effusion. He received TPA x 3 on three consecutive days. A
repeat CT on [**2190-4-9**] showed Right basal chest tube in place,
with overall decrease in amount of right pleural fluid, with
small loculated component along the right major fissure. Also,
interval increase in size of small left pleural effusion.
He was transferred to the ICU for respiratory distress on and
was eventually intubated.

Due to the persistent effusion and repeated taps and tPA of the
chest tubes on the right side, the Thoracic team took him to the
OR on [**2190-4-14**] for a VATS. He had a Right-sided pneumonia and
right
complex parapneumonic effusion. Right vats decortication,
pleural biopsy and
flexible bronchoscopy.
He was managed by the Thoracic Surgery Service in regards to the
chest tubes.

On [**2190-4-20**] he had a Flexible bronchoscopy for Respiratory
failure, ventilator-
associated pneumonia, and moderate-to-severe tracheal
bronchomalacia.

He was extubated on [**2190-4-22**], but was unable to tolerate for any
extended time. He had to be re-intubated.

On [**2190-4-26**], he had a Trach/PEG placed. He contiued to need good
respiratory care
