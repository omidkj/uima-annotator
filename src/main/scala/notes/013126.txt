NOTE:  This discharge summary will cover the [**Hospital 228**]
hospital course from [**2123-6-7**] to [**2123-6-10**].

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  Congestive heart failure:  The patient's
Hydrochlorothiazide was discontinued due to concern for
possible hypouricemia.  Her Bumex was changed from 5 mg p.o.
Twice a day to 4 mg p.o. twice a day as her creatinine began
to rise and there was concern that she was being over
diuresed.

2.  Chronic renal failure: The patient's creatinine bumped
from 2.8 to 3.1 in the setting of increasing her diuretic
dose; therefore, her Bumex was bumped back down to 4 mg p.o.
twice a day.

3.  Infectious disease:  An infectious disease consult was
obtained regarding length of treatment and duration of
antibiotics for treatment of her Methicillin resistant
Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia.  They recommended
continuing her on Oxacillin two grams intravenous q. six
hours until [**2123-7-1**].  After a long debate between the
infectious disease service and the renal service regarding
whether or not to leave her Hickman catheter in, it was
decided that since she may need dialysis in the future,
despite the risks of infection, that her Hickman should
remain in place.

4.  Musculoskeletal:  Her Dexamethasone was tapered from 2 mg
p.o. q. day to 2 mg alternating with 1 mg q.o.d.  Next, week,
she will begin Dexamethasone, 1 mg p.o. q. day.  The
following week, she will begin at .5 mg p.o. q. day and then
stop.  Additionally, she underwent an IR guided tap of her
left shoulder, as there was concern for possible septic
arthritis, given the fact that she had a MSSA bacteremia;
however, no fluid was obtained from the tap and, therefore,
it was felt that it was an extremely low possibility that she
had MSSA septic arthritis.
