ECHO:Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with regional
systolic dysfunction. Mild aortic regurgitation. Pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. Dilated ascending aorta.
Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable
for review) of [**2178-3-24**], the regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction is new and c/w multivessel CAD or Takotsumo
cardiomyopathy. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure
is higher. The ascending aorta dilation is similar.
.
MRI/MRA head:
1. Infundibulum at the origin of the left posterior cerebral
artery P1 segment versus sub-3-mm aneurysm in this area. A CTA
of the head would be valuable in clarifying this issue.
2. Extensive bilateral white matter T2/FLAIR hyperintensity
consistent with small vessel ischemic disease.
3. Incompletely evaluated degenerative change of the upper
cervical spine.
.
Cardiac catheterization:
1. Non-obstructive CAD with 40% proximal LAD thrombus likely
representing resolved thrombus.
2. Elevated left sided filling pressures.
3. Mild pulmonary arterial hypertension.


Brief Hospital Course:
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN, TO BE REVIEWED AND DISCUSSED IN
MULTIDISCIPLINARY ROUNDS:
.
89F with PMH of CAD s/p DES to OM [**2178**], HTN, hyperlipidemia
presents with 1 week of shortness of breath.
.
# CAD/Ischemia: Patient presented with one week of shortness of
breath but denied chest pain. Noted to have diffuse, nonspecific
ST elevations on ECG. Underwent cardiac catheterization
significant for patent stent and 40% proximal LAD thrombus. Pt
had persistent ST elevations post cath. Unclear etiology. No
evidence of pericarditis clinically. ESR was slightly elevated
making myocarditis unlikely. No apical ballooning noted on ECHO
but patient did have diffuse hypokinesis making stress
cardiomyopathy a possible etiology of her ECG changes. No
evidence of aneurysm. Patient was continued on aspirin, statin,
started on ace inhibitor and bblocker was titrated. Her plavix
was discontinued as her stent was placed in [**2178**].
.
# Pump: Echo with EF of 25%. Patient required nasal cannula and
was decompensated heart failure with pulmonary edema. She was
treated with diuresis and discharged on double her home dose
lasix. An ace inhibitor was added for afterload reduction.
.
# Rhythm: Patient had one episode of afib with RVR complicated
by hypotension converted to sinus rhythm s/p amiodarone load.
Remained in sinus on telemetry for duration of stay. Discharged
on amiodaron 200mg daily. Toprol was titrated up as tolerated by
her blood pressure.

.
# HTN:  Titrated her toprol and lisinopril as tolerated by blood
pressure.
.
# Pansensitive E.coli UTI: Treated with 5 days of bactrim. Foley
was removed. Symptoms improved.
.
# Chronic kidney disease: Presumed chronic kidney disease. Hx of
partial nephrectomy. Creatinine remained stable in setting of
diuresis.
.
# FEN: cardiac/heart healthy diet; replete lytes PRN

.
# Code: Full, discussed with patient and husband
.
# Communication: patient and husband ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 97554**] (home);
