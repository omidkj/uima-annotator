EKG [**12-28**] - Rhythm is most likely sinus rhythm with frequent
atrial premature beats. Diffuse ST-T wave changes which are
non-specific. Compared to the previous tracing of [**2131-10-27**] there
is no significant diagnostic change.

Chest x-ray [**12-28**] - No significant change since the prior
examination. Appearances are suggestive of mild CHF. Followup
radiography is recommended post-diuresis.

Chest x-ray [**12-31**] - IMPRESSION: Subsegmental atelectasis


Brief Hospital Course:
# Dyspnea: Complicated picture likely multifactorial. Patient
not taking BiPAP at home, also patient with upper respiratory
symptoms and sounds congested on exam.  Initially concern for
COPD exacerbation in the MICU and recieved 1 dose of prednisone
but this was stopped.  Also with chest x-ray there is some
suggestion of mild CHF and patient has gotten one time doses of
diuresis.  Of note, patient also requires home oxygen and BiPAP
at night, but known not compliant with BiPAP which likely was a
contributing factor to this exacerbation. Pt was at her baseline
CO2 on ABG. PE was initially on the differential and in the MICU
they got a d-dimer which was elevated however no additional
studies were completed afterwards as apparently patient was
unable to tolerate CTA and there was felt to be low likely of
PE. CXR demonstrated no active infection and no leukocytosis on
admission. Received lovonex 125 mg IV once in ED. On transfer to
the floor, patient was restarted on home lasix dose of 80 mg PO
daily, as patient with stable creatinine. repeat chest x-ray
demonstrated no evidence of chf or infiltrate and mild bilateral
atelectasis. Patient was continued on BiPAP at night and setting
were adjusted as per respiratory therapy to optimize patient's
oxygentation.  Patient was continued on home COPD medications as
well as standing nebulizers and PRN. On discharge patient with
stable oxygen requirement and appears at baseline level of
comfort
.
# Altered mental status: Unclear what initial presentation was
in the MICU but on transfer to the floor, orientation at
baseline. Initial change in mental status may be secondary to
hypercarbia in the setting of BiPAP non-compliance and multiple
medications including oxycodone. Oxycodone was discontinued . No
white count or fever to suggest infection. Recieved small dose
of narcan. Ucx negative and blood cultures no growth to date.
Avoided sedating medications for pain control.
.
# Neck pain: Pain is chronic and likely musculoskeletal vs. DJD
changes. [**Month (only) 116**] have nerve  impingement in the C2 region based on
her pain. Normal strenth.  CT C spine done on [**10-26**] as
outpatient which  showed degenerative changes and limited study
due to cervical  positioning in lateral film. Pt cannot have MRI
of her C spine  due to her ICD.  For pain control patient was
started on round the clock tylenol as well as a lidoderm patch.
Patient noted to be somewhat somnolent on standing tramadol at
50 mg PO BID, so changed patient to 25 mg PO BID PRN with goal
that nursing frequently observe patient for pain. This is
obviously difficult given patient is Farsi speaking. Avoid
narcotics.
.
#CAD: h/o CABG. No chest pain or EKG changes.
Patient was continued on ASA, statin, Toprol XL.
.
# Chronic diastolic CHF: possible that patient with CHF
exacerbation as discussed above.  Patient was continued on home
lasix, beta-blocker, statin.  Given history of CHF patient was
also started on a low dose lisinopril.
.
# DMII, controlled.
While patient was in house, held home glyburide, continued
insulin sliding scale. glyburide was started again on discharge.

.
#HTN: BP appears well controlled
continued outpatient meds, added acei
.
# Hypothyroidism: Continued levothyroxine, tsh was normal
.
# Anemia: Currently stable in 30s. Patient has previously had
