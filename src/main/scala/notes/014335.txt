Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 297**]
Chief Complaint:
Reason for initial admission at OSH: CVA with hypercapnic coma
.
Reason for transfer: Revision of trach tube occlusion
.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Bronchoscopy

History of Present Illness:
HPI: 76 yo F with a h/o COPD, a fib, NSTEMI, recent trach/PEG
after chronic intubation being transferred from OSH for revision
of trach tube. Per OSH records, upon her initial presentation to
the OSH in [**2173-7-6**], pt had been feeling unwell for a few days. A
neighbor drove the pt to the hospital. Pt feelin weak and
off-balance. O2 sat 87% at the time, other vitals unavailable.
ABG: pH 7.06, PCO2 164, pO2 unavailable. Pt was intubated, with
improved ABG of pH 7.4, pCO2 58 over unclear time period. Also
of note CT head performed in the ED demonstrated small
infarction in the region of the right PCA of unclear age with no
focal deficits.
.
Pt transfered to the MICU. Her course was further complicated by
an NSTEMI for which she was started on lovenox/ASA. Echo at the
time revealed LVH, AI, mild pulmonary htn, good levf with no
evidence of wma. On lovenox/asa pt developed hemoptysis.
Bronchoscopy revealed RML hemorrhage, which resolved once the
medications were discontinued. Pt later developed evidence of
PNA, BAL from original bronch grew out Pseudomonas and Serratia.
Pt started on 6 week course of cipro.
.
Pt could not be weaned and, after family meeting, it was decided
for pt to be trached/PEGd. This was done on [**2173-7-20**].  Pt doing
well after this until one week PTA when she was noted to be
desatting and having low tidal volumes. This appeared to be
positional. ENT consulted and tracheoscopy performed which
demonstrated intermittent tube occlusion at the distal end with
a granuloma.
.
Pt transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.

Brief Hospital Course:
Impression: 76 yo F with a h/o COPD, a fib, NSTEMI, recent
trach/PEG after chronic intubation being transferred from OSH
for revision of trach tube.
.
Hospital Course:
.
Airway obstruction: On admission interventional pulmonology was
consulted and the patient received bronchoscopy at bedside. The
bronch demonstrated that the trach tube was eroding into the
posterior membrane which was necrotic, possibly pressure
necrosis. There was no evidence of granulation tissue, however
there was some redundant tissue that bowed up just distal to the
distal end of the trach tube. On [**8-19**] the patient's trach tube
was replaced by a Shiley 8 mm X 105 mm, though there was still
some evidence of redundant tissue at the distal end of the new
tube.
.
Respiratory failure: The patient is chronically venilator
dependent on trach. The patient was attempted on multiple
pressure support trials which were unsuccessful. Her vent
settings were optimized throughout her hospitalization for
optimal ventilation/oxygenation. However, the patient continued
to desaturate due to respiratory failure and pneumonia. The
patient died on [**2173-8-31**] after a family meeting was held and a
morphine drip has been initiated.
.
PNA: On transfer the patient was on a 6-week course of
ciprofloxacin. This was discontinued. However on [**8-20**] the
patient began spiking low-grade temps in the setting of CXR
significant for left lower lobe consolidation and leukocytosis.
The patient was started on cefepime and vancomycin. Sputum
cultures grew out Pseudomonas as well as stenotrophomonas, for
which bactrim was added. The pneumonia was adequately treated.
However, the patient continued to have respiratory distress as
described above.
.
Anemia: The patient's lab work was consistent with anemia of
chronic disease. Her hematocrit remained low-stable throughout
the admission.
.
HTN: The patient had a labile blood pressure throughout the
admission. Episodes of hypertension appeared to correlate with
her level of anxiety/agitation. The patient was maintained on
metoprolol from admission. Diltiazem was added as below.
.
Atrial fibrillation: The patient has known chronic A fib. She
was rate-controlled on metoprolol and diltiazem, which was a
newly added medication. She was started on a heparin drip and
remained therapeutic.
.
CAD: The patient was continued on a BB, statin, and ASA
throughout the admission.
.
anxiety: The patient was continued on citalopram, with ativan as
needed throughout the admission.
.
ppx: The patient was placed on pneumoboots, a ppi, and SC
heparin throughout the admission.
.
FEN: The patient received TFs thorughout the admission.
.
access: R PICC, L A-line
