Brief Hospital Course:
Patient was admited to the regular hospital floor s/p open
cholycystectomy, panniculectomy and gastrectomy. On post day one
the patient was following a regular post operative coarse with a
PCA for pain, foley catheter to monitor urine output and an NGT
to decompress the resection from above. On the night of
postoperative day one to day two the patient experienced low
urine output and was bolused nearly four liters of fluid. She
was monitored with serial hematocrit checks which remained
stable. The patient encountered respiratory compromise from
acute renal failure was transferred to the ICU where her urine
output, CVP and general health were closely monitored. The
patient stayed in the ICU for four days until her creatinine
trended down from 2.2 to 1.4 and she was reliably making urine.
The patient's oxygen requirement was also decreased to 2L nasal
cannula prior to transfer to the floor on post op day six. While
on the regular hospital floor the patient tolerated a regular
diet, was able to urinate on her own, and maintained excellent
pain control. Her abdominal incision appears clean, without
evidence of infection or cellulitis. She will be discharged with
a JP drain, the drain is to remain inplace and its output should
be monitored and recorded. The patient is also taking lasix,
this is not one of her prior home medications, therefore this
med ought to be discontinued in three to fours days from
discharge.
