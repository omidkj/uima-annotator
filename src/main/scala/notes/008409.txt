Chief Complaint:
SOB/cough

Liver biopsy

History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 54 yo M with a h/o AML s/p a matched related
allogeneic stem cell transplant on [**2171-1-8**] with busulfan and
Cytoxan conditioning with complications of CMV viremia, GVHD,
hemorrhagic cystitis, and disseminated TB with 2 recent
admissions with pericardial effusion and tamponade, s/p window
on [**2172-1-10**]. The patient presented to the ED today with SOB and
cough x 1 week. The patients wife reports that over the past [**5-16**]
days the patient has had fevers to 101, fatigue, weakness, and
persistent cough with blood tinged sputum.
.
Of note, the patient was recently admitted on [**2171-12-4**] with
shortness of breath, cough, and peripheral edema. He was found
to have a pericardial effusion with early tamponade physiology.
The effusion was drained for a total of 1300cc's of fluid. It
was felt the more likely etiology as a viral process although no
specific etiology has been found. Recent AFB smears have been
negative but a recent culture has grown positive for
Xanthamonas. He also was noted for persistent positive B-glucan
and Mr. [**Known lastname 63305**] was treated with Bactrim to cover both PCP and
[**Name9 (PRE) 63311**]. Unfortunately, the patient required another urgent
admission ([**Date range (3) 63312**]) with pericardial effusion and
tamponade. This was drained again and a window was place. There
was no infectious etiology identified and the thought was this
could be related to GVHD. During this admission, his antibiotics
were changed to prophylactic doing for PCP with Bactrim. Since
that time, the patient has been slowly improving and was about
to restart photopheresis therapy for GVHD.
.
In the ED today, initial vitals were T99.8, HR 191 BP 91/65 RR25
O2 100% NRB (77%RA). Initially found to have a glucose of 49. He
received 1 amp D50. He became hypotensive to the 70's and
neosynephrine was initialed. He was them emergently intubated
(received etomidate 20/Succ 120mg). His HR remained in the
160's-170's and he was cardioverted (100J) and converted to
sinus tacycardia (HR 120's-130's). A RIJ was placed for code
sepsis. His BP remained low and levophed was started. He
received 3L NS, vanocmycin, ceftaz, flagyl, and levofloxacin. A
CXR was concerning for RUL PNA and fluid overload. Cardiology
was consulted and performed a bedside ECHO which revealed a
loculated effusion unchanged from prior ECHO on [**2172-2-20**]. He also
received a unit of FFP after the line placement.


Past Medical History:
ONC HISTORY (per OMR):
1. Diagnosed in early [**8-/2169**] with nightly fevers. BM bx
revealed AML. Flow cytometry showed aberrant expression of CD2,
CD7, HLA-DR, CD 34, dim CD33, CD 117, and CD 71. CT scan
revealednecrotic lymph nodes in the superior mediastinum and
periportalregion, and multiple low attenuation lesions in the
liver and spleen concerning for microabscesses from a
disseminated infection.
2. [**2169-8-17**]: Induction chemotherapy with cytarabine and
idarubicin complicated by persistent fevers and extensive workup
ultimately revealing disseminated tuberculosis infection. His
course was also complicated by rapid atrial fibrillation and
hypotension and the development of a severe cardiomyopathy.
3. S/P one dose of high-dose ARA-C at 1.5 mg per meter squared,
lowered dose due to his disseminated tuberculosis, and then he
received a second course of HiDAC at 3 gram per meter squared
dose and developed acute onset of gait instability. No further
chemotherapy given.
4. Relapsed in 7/[**2170**]. [**Year (4 digits) **] re-induction with ME on [**2170-8-13**].
Noted for pulmonary nodules which were suspicious for
aspergillus and empirically treated with Voriconazole with
improvement noted on CT.
5. Admitted on [**2170-10-25**] for maintenance therapy while awaiting
BMT. However, upon admit he was again found to have blasts. He
proceeded with Idarubicin and Cytarabine(7+2) butdid not achieve
a remission.
6. S/P High dose Ara-c with remission.
7. [**Year (4 digits) **] sibling related allo transplant on [**2171-1-8**]. Allo
course c/b increased LFTs of unclear etiology, possibly from
chemotherapy, renal failure attributed to CSA, and received only
1 dose of MTX due to mucositis.
8. Post transplant course complicated by asymptomatic CMV
viremia and
viral/URI syndromes.
9. In [**2171-5-12**] developed diarrhea with e/o GVH on endoscopy.
He also
had hematuria, but no evidence of BK virus. He started
photopheresis.
Diarrhea abated but LFTs rose. Therapy attempted for GVH of
liver using pulse of prednisone and increase in CellCept with
stabilization but no significant improvement.
10. Received 1mg of Pentostatin on [**2171-6-14**].
11. Liver Biopsy c/w GVHD. Started Rituxan for 4 weeks in
5/[**2171**].

rifabutin

Social History:
He is married and lives at home with his wife & children. He is
