IMAGING:
----------------
CT T-Spine(Post-op):
FINDINGS:
The patient is status post posterior fusion extending from
T5-T11. There is significant artifact arising from metallic
components within the hardware. At the level of T6, the surgical
screws terminate lateral to the vertebral body on both sides. At
the level of T7, the left screw terminates laterally to the
vertebral body. At level T9, the left surgical screw is located
laterally to both the left pedicle as well as the vertebral body
throughout its entire length. The remaining screws appear intact
and appropriately positioned, with no evidence of loosening.
There is an old left 1st rib fracture (T1). The overall
configuration of the
vertebral bodies is unchanged from prior CT examination from
[**2137-8-13**]. The T8 compression fracture is unchanged in appearance
from prior
examination, and still demonstrates retropulsion.
IMPRESSION:
1. Stable T8 compression fracture.
2. Multiple surgical screws seen in levels T6, T7, and T9 do not
terminate in the vertebral bodies. At level T9, the left
surgical screw is located
completely lateral to both the pedicle and vertebral body.
3. There is no evidence of hardware loosening.

EKG [**8-28**]:
Sinus rhythm. Left axis deviation. Inferior myocardial
infarction of
indeterminate age. Compared to the previous tracing of [**2137-8-23**]
there is no
significant difference.

KUB [**8-31**]:
FINDINGS:
There is marked gaseous distention of the colon and small bowel.
Air is seen in the rectum. This finding likely represents ileus.
Stool is seen in the cecum.

CT Abdomen/Pelvis [**8-31**]:
CT ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST: There is trace left pleural
effusion. Dependent atelectatic changes are also noted in the
lung bases. The patient has had prior CABG. No pericardial
effusion is seen. An NG tube is seen coiled in the fundus of the
stomach. The liver, spleen, pancreas, adrenal glands, kidneys,
and ureters are unremarkable except to note a 2.7 cm cyst in the
interpolar left kidney. The patient is status post
cholecystectomy. Atherosclerotic calcifications are noted along
the abdominal aorta, without aneurysmal dilatation. No lymph
node
enlargement is seen meeting size criteria for adenopathy. The
stomach and small bowel are not dilated. Orally administered
contrast has reached the mid to distal small bowel. The colon,
however, is distended, measuring up to 8.1 cm at the hepatic
flexure. Air-fluid level is noted throughout the colon, a
nonspecific finding. No bowel wall thickening, pneumatosis
intestinalis, or free air is noted within the abdomen. There is
trace fluid in the pelvis and also along the paracolic gutters
bilaterally;
fluid is noted to be closely associated with the colon along the
right
paracolic gutter (2:56, 301b:31).
CT PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST: Gas is noted within the urinary
bladder, which is collapsed, with Foley catheter in place. The
prostate is enlarged, measuring up to 5.6 cm in transverse
dimension. The rectosigmoid colon appears normal in caliber but
is also noted to have air-fluid level. No free air or adenopathy
is noted within the pelvis. Trace fluid is seen within the
pelvis.
OSSEOUS STRUCTURES: Patient is noted to have had recent spinal
fusion with
bilateral pedicle screws and fusion rods noted from the
visualized T5 through T11, spanning across T8, where there has
been loss of vertebral body height compared to [**2137-6-13**], now to
approximately 50%, similar to that seen on pre-operative CT
T-spine of [**2137-8-13**]. Bone graft donor site is noted along the
right iliac crest, with multiple small bony fragments and
subcutaneous gas noted within the site. Subcutaneous gas is also
noted along the left lower anterior abdominal wall. Sclerotic
focus in the left iliac [**Doctor First Name 362**], and also smaller focus on the
right, are not changed from the recent comparison study.
IMPRESSIONS:
1. No definite features of colitis, such as wall thickening or
loss of normal haustral pattern. However, there is abnormal
fluid-filled distention of the colon with paracolic fluid,
particularly along the proximal colon, concerning for colitis.
No free air, pneumatosis or small bowel obstruction. Patent
large mesenteric vessels. Clinical correlation recommended.
2. Status post CABG and cholecystectomy.
3. Trace left pleural effusion with bibasilar dependent
atelectasis.
4. Status post T-spine fusion with burst fracture and
retropulsion at T8
unchanged from [**2137-8-13**].
5. Subcutaneous gas at the right iliac crest donor site. Given
recent
surgery on [**2137-8-29**], findings likely postoperative in nature.
6. Bubbles of gas along the left lower anterior abdominal wall,
probably due to recent injections.





Brief Hospital Course:
Patient is 64M who presented on [**2137-8-28**] for elective admission
for thoracic spine fusion for a known T8 fracture.
Post-operatively, he was taken to the PACU for post-anesthesia
monitoring. Approximately 3hours after surgery, he complained of
a "brick sitting on his chest", which he stated was reminiscent
of a prior MI. A stat EKG, enzymes, and aspirin were given.  EKG
did not reveal any acute changes, and a set of three enzymes did
not reveal any evidence of cardiac event. He was then
transferred to the neurosurgery floor.  On POD#1, his Foley
catheter was removed, pain medications further adjusted, and
assisted to get OOB to work with nursing and physical therapy.
He was determined to be safe for disposition to home.  However,
on the morning of [**8-31**], he was significantly nauseated and
developed abdominal distention.  A KUB image was obtained, and
findings consitent with post-operative ileus were found.  A
[**Last Name (un) 1372**]-gastric tube was placed for decompression, and he was
placed on bowel rest(NPO). Later in the afternoon, he was found
to be febrile to 101, mildly tachycardic, and still not quite
feeling well despite NGT placement, so he was transferred to the
ICU for further management and evaluation.  A CT of the abdomen
and pelvis was performed, which did NOT show any free air, or
mesenteric obstruction.  There was however findings that could
be consistent with colitis.  General surgery was consulted for
further management. They placed a rectal tube to further
facilitate mesenteric decompression, and propylactic antibiotics
Unasyn/Flagyl) were started. The patient improved significantly
over the next several days. His rectal tube and foley wer
removed on [**2137-9-3**] and his TLSO was refitted. He was
transferred to the neurosurgical floor on [**9-4**] and the general
surgery team removed his NGT. His diet ws slowly advanced late
that day and he was tolerating a regular diet by [**9-5**]. On
[**2137-9-6**] he was afebrile and tolerating a diet well. He was
ambulating with his TLSO in place. There was 3 additional
staples placed in the inferior portion of his incision due to
