History of Present Illness:
56 year old female with a past medical history significant for
multiple sclerosis in a wheelchair, and DVT on coumadin who
presented with shortness of breath. [**Doctor Last Name 402**], her personal care
attendant, reports on Friday patient had some coughing, but no
shortness of breath. She got chest physical therapy and some
suctioning and felt better. On Saturday, she was slightly worse
with some cough, and shortness of breath, that improved
suctioning and pulmonary treatments. Today she had wheezing,
short of breath, and coughing. A neighbor was somehow notified
of shortness of breath and called EMS. EMS found patient 84 %,
placed on NRB then was 100%.

In ED, patient was alert, able to nod head to questions. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]
[**Doctor Last Name 402**] baseline is limited communication, mostly non-verbal.
Noted to have noisy upper respiratory sounds. Guaiac negative.
Underwent nasotracheal suctioning without significant
secretions, but with re-positioning appeared to throw up G-tube
feeds. Placed NGtube and suctioned tube feeds. Clinically felt
to aspirate. Portable CXR L basilar retrocardiac PNA. EKG sinus
tach at 118. Got Levoquin 750, flagyl, tylenol and toradol. Got
2.5 L fluid. Vitals Rectal 99.0, HR 106, BP 119/63, RR 18-20,
o2sat 96% 6 liters. Planned for unit transfer, then noted blood
in her airway, unclear source but suspected NG tube and got
intubated for airway protection. ED spoke with ENT, packed her
mouth and sent to ICU for further care.


Past Medical History:

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 56 year old female with advanced multiple sclerosis
admitted for pneumonia.

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient required intubation related
to her underlying PNA.  She also developed lobar collapse versus
segmental atelectasis on imaging when she was initially weaned
to pressure support.  Sedation was weaned off but extubation was
problem[**Name (NI) 115**] due to weakened gag reflex, underlying muscle
weakness secondary to advanced multiple sclerosis, volume
overload, copious oral secretions, and lack of cuff leak.  She
received a course of dexamethasone given her absence of cuff
leak.  Further diuresis was attempted but was limited by the
patient developing hypotension.  She was extubated on [**4-28**] after
a 4 day trial of PSV.  After exutbation, she still had a high
oxygen requirement and need for frequent suctioning of oral
secretions. Her saturation would improve with repositioning,
chest PT, and suctioning which suggested that she may have had
intermittent mucous plugging.  She also had some pleural
effusions on imaging.  The patient confirmed that she would not
want to be re-intubated and her code status was changed to
DNR/DNI.  She required aggressive chest PT, scopolamine patches
as needed to reduce oral secretions, as well as ipratropium,
albuterol, Mucomyst, and fluticasone MDIs to improve her
pulmonary status.  An insufflator/exsufflator was also initiated
to stimulate cough to further help to bring up secretions.  She
was also continued on her home biPAP of [**9-23**] at night.  Her
fluticasone MDI was discontinued prior to discharge given the
association of steroids with increased incidence of pneumonia.
She may benefit from intermittent scopolamine patches to help
decrease her oral secretions.

2. PNA:  Most likely community acquired with an aspiration
component given her altered gag reflex and observation in the ED
of tube feeds in her mouth.  She was orginally on levofloxacin,
ceftiaxone, and flagyl.  Ceftriaxone was discontinued [**4-23**].
Flagyl was changed to clindamycin to cover for celllulitis as
detailed below.  She completed a 7 days course of levofloxacin
and was continued clindamycin to treat both her cellulitis and
aspiration.

3. Leukocytosis/Fevers:  The patient developed leukocytosis on
[**4-29**] in addition to some low-grade fevers.  She has had no other
localizing sources of infection other than her PNA and improving
cellulitis.  Her fevers may possibly be due to atelectasis, but
C. diff was also ruled out given the administration of
antibiotics.  Her PICC was placed on [**4-24**].  She has not had any
fevers for a few days prior to disch
