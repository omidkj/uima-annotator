History of Present Illness:
78 yo F with PMHx of anxiety, chronic pain, and baseline memory
problems that who is being transferred from [**Hospital 189**] Hospital for
continued management of Cdiff collitis. Entire history obtained
from daughter [**Name (NI) 5627**] and records from OSH. Her mental status is
important. Her baseline is functionally independent of ADLs and
IDLs and lived alone. However she has been treated for dementia,
daughter says this was never confirmed and she took her off
Aricept after 2 months of memory not improving.

In summary, patient was admitted to [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 189**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] for the
first [**2110-2-21**] for concern over profuse diaphoresis treated with
IV levaquin and discharged on ciprofloxacin for UTI (culture
negative per dtr) which was subsequently stopped by daughter the
day after discharge. On Friday [**2110-2-23**] patient was found
wandering with keys in hands confused, outside in cold. Dtr was
called and she was put back in bed. She takes a lot of pain
medications at baseline and dtr was concerned that she took to
many but this was not true. The next morning, patient was found
sitting in couch in her own feces still confused. Family brought
her to the ED on [**2110-2-24**].

At the OSH, they found her to be Cdiff positive and started her
on PO Vanc and IV flagyl with lactobacillus. She clearly was not
mentally at baseline, AAOx1 and periodically agitated. She had a
head MRI that showed 2 small parieta and occiptial CVAs per dtr.
LP was performed and negative for meningitis. [**Hospital **] hospital
course was complicated by bandemia, sinus tachycardia, delirium,
hypoalbumenia, and thrombocytopenia with concern of septic
physiology. She received 12 U of platelets. She was also found
to have a VRE UTI. For her Cdiff, surgery and GI was consulted.
GI did a flex [**Hospital 65**] that showed pseudomembranous colitis with some
healthy bowels. CT scan showed pancolitis. Surgery suggested a
total colectomy but no evidence of pneumatosis was seen. No
evidence of toxic megacolon or ischemic bowel by sigmoidoscopy
and surgery was held off. For a day or so patient was treated
with ceftazidine but bandemia worsened and it was held off. Last
stool culture negative for Cdiff but positive for [**Female First Name (un) 564**]
Albicans. She had a picc placed and was received TPN. Delirium
was bad that she would try to get out of bed and required a
zipper-incased bed for restraints. She was r/o for PE by CTA.

Currently, patient reported thirst and fatigue but denied fever,
chills or abdominal pain. She did seem aggitated and wanted to
be "left alone."

[**2110-3-8**] KUB FINDINGS: Substantial dilatation is seen involving
predominantly colon.However, there is some small bowel
dilatation as well. The appearance is difficult to assess on
plain radiographs and CT would be necessary for more accurate
evaluation of the situation within the abdomen.
.
[**2110-3-17**] KUB:IMPRESSION: Gastric distension which may be related
to air swallowing. Slightinterval decrease in colonic distention
without thumbprinting or mucosal wall thickening. No free air.
.
1/26/09RUE U/SIMPRESSION: Focal, non-occlusive thrombus around
the right PICC in the axillary vein. Thrombus does not extend
proximally or distally. The subclavian and brachial veins are
clear.

[**3-25**] ECHO
IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Dilated left ventricular
cavity and regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction
consistent with coronary artery disease. At least moderate
aortic regurgitation (may be underestimated due to tachycardia
and frequent ectopy). Mild to moderate mitral regurgitation.

[**3-26**] LUE U/S
IMPRESSION: Patent left-sided vessels surrounding left PICC. No
evidence of left upper extremity DVT. Left basilic and cephalic
veins not identified.

CLOSTRIDIUM DIFFICILE TOXIN A & B TEST (Final [**2110-3-25**]):
      Feces negative for C.difficile toxin A & B by EIA.
