Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2962**]
Chief Complaint:
Abnormal stress test, s/p elective cardiac catheterization

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
cardiac catheterization

History of Present Illness:
Patient is an 88 year old woman with no prior known CAD, history
of hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, descending thoracic
aortic aneurysm, who presents for elective cardiac cath.
The patient was in her USOH until 3 weeks PTA when she began
experiencing SOB at rest and with exertion, fatigue. She
experiences these symptoms primarily first thing in the morning
when she wakes up. They occur at rest and with exertion. It is
not associated with CP, nausea, diaphoresis, back pain. ROS
otherwise notable for lower extremity edema over past few
months, occasional palpitations for past couple years. She
denies any chest pain or pressure, nausea, diaphoresis,
claudication, orthopnea, PND, lightheadedness, any other
symptoms.
.
She saw her PCP, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) 24717**] for outpt stress. on [**6-11**], it showed
basal to mid lateral wall infarct, EF 56%, mid lateral wall
hypokinesis. Therefore, sent for elective cath.
.
Cath done today ([**2137-6-21**]) notable for 3VD. She received BM stent
to the LAD. Cath was complicated by vagal response during radial
approach. She became brady and hypotensive. Atropine 1mg x2
given. Dopamine gtt started. She went into afib/flutter. DCCV x2
without effect. Amio given and dopa stopped. Neo was started
then she underwent DCCV x2 again with no effect. She
spontaneously converted to NSR and her bp improved. Neo weaned
to off.
.
Currently, she complains of bilateral leg pain. no SOB, CP, abd
pain, headache, difficulty with speech.
.

disease or sudden death.

Pertinent Results:
EKG precath: sinus brady. nl axis. nl intervals. TW flattening
aVL.
EKG postcath: NSR, nl axis, nl intervals, TW flattening aVL,
biphasic P waves V1
.
ETT performed on [**6-11**] date demonstrated: abnormal perfusion c/w
infarct involving the basal to mid lateral wall with mild degree
of peri-infarct ischemia. Low noraml left ventricular systolic
function with EF 56% and hypokinesis of the lateral to
mid-lateral wall.
Patient exercised on a modified [**Doctor First Name **] protocol to 78% of her
maximum predicted heart rate. Nuclear imaging was significant
for a basal to mid lateral wall infarct with a mild degree of
peri-infarct ischemia. EF 56% with basal and mid lateral wall
hypokinesis.
.
CARDIAC CATH:
LMCA: mild plaques
LAD: 99% heavy calcified prox stenosis with 70% mid LAD
stenosis, D2 70% stenosis
LCX: TO prox with collaterals
RCA: 80% ostial stenosis
s/p BM stent to LAD stenosis
.
ECHO:
The left atrium is elongated. The right atrium is markedly
dilated. The
estimated right atrial pressure is 16-20 mmHg. Left ventricular
wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. There is
moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
inferolateral
akinesis and inferior hypokinesis. Overall left ventricular
systolic function
is moderately depressed. The right ventricular cavity is
dilated. Right
ventricular systolic function is normal. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are
mildly thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis. Mild (1+)
aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Mild
(1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary
artery systolic
hypertension. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial
effusion.
.

Brief Hospital Course:
Pt is an 88 year old woman with no prior known CAD, history of
hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, descending thoracic aortic
aneurysm, who presents for elective cardiac cath. Cath showed
3VD and successful stenting of the LAD with a bare metal stent.
She became transiently hypotensive and brady which was c/w vagal
episode. She then went into afib/flutter in the setting of dopa
gtt. She spontaneously converted after amio gtt started and
after 4 rounds of DCCV.
.
#) CAD: no prior disease despite many risk factors. Cath as
above shows 3VD now s/p stent x2 to LAD.
 continue ASA 325, plavix 75, metop at 25 [**Hospital1 **], statin, ACEi
- Follow up with outpatient cardiologist
.
#) Rhythm: Had both atrial fibrillation with RVR and evidence
for AVNRT during admission. Currently controlled with
metoporolol [**Hospital1 **] and also began Amiodarone with anticoagulation.
She tolerated the medications well. Her tachycardias were not
associated with hypotension on the floor. She was discharged
with [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]-of-Hearts monitor and follow up appointment with Dr.
[**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] of EP.
.
#) Pump: Mildly overloaded on exam postcath. This improved with
restarted normal lasix dose. Continued [**Last Name (un) **]. Post cath echo:
moderate regional left ventricular dysfunction with
inferolateral akinesis and inferior hypokinesis. Mod depressed
function. Will continue with low dose outpaient Lasix.
.
She was discharged to extended care facility who will follow her
INR in conjunction with her PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) 42276**]. She will follow up
with EP here for her supraventricular tachycardias.
