Findings
LEFT ATRIUM: Elongated LA. Dilated LA. Mild spontaneous echo
contrast in the body of the LA. Good (>20 cm/s) LAA ejection
velocity.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: A catheter or pacing wire is
seen in the RA and extending into the RV. No ASD by 2D or color
Doppler.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Wall thickness and cavity dimensions were
obtained from 2D images. Normal LV wall thickness. Mild regional
LV systolic dysfunction.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTA: Focal calcifications in aortic root. Normal ascending
aorta diameter. Simple atheroma in ascending aorta. Focal
calcifications in ascending aorta. Normal aortic arch diameter.
Simple atheroma in aortic arch. Normal descending aorta
diameter. Complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending thoracic
aorta. Focal calcifications in descending aorta.

AORTIC VALVE: Three aortic valve leaflets. Severely
thickened/deformed aortic valve leaflets. Severe AS (area
0.8-1.0cm2). Mild to moderate ([**1-23**]+) AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Moderately thickened mitral valve leaflets.
Moderate mitral annular calcification. No MS. [**Name13 (STitle) 15110**] to co-existing
AR, the pressure half-time estimate of mitral valve area may be
an OVERestimation of true area. Moderate (2+) MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Tricuspid valve not well visualized.
Physiologic TR.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Pulmonic valve not well seen.
No PR.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify I was present in compliance with HCFA
regulations. The patient was under general anesthesia throughout
the procedure. No TEE related complications. Suboptimal image
quality. The patient appears to be in sinus rhythm. Results were
Conclusions
PRE BYPASS The left atrium is elongated. The left atrium is
dilated. Mild spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body of
the left atrium. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color
Doppler. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. There is
mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
moderate apical and distal anteroseptal hypokinesis. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There
are simple atheroma in the ascending aorta. There are simple
atheroma in the aortic arch. There are complex (>4mm) atheroma
in the descending thoracic aorta. There are three aortic valve
leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets are severely
thickened/deformed. There is severe aortic valve stenosis (valve
area 0.6 cm2). Mild to moderate ([**1-23**]+) aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are moderately thickened. Due to
co-existing aortic regurgitation, the pressure half-time
estimate of mitral valve area may be an OVERestimation of true
mitral valve area. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in person of the results in the operating
room at the time of the study.

POST BYPASS The patient is in sinus rhythm. The right ventricle
displays normal systolic function. The left ventricle displays
slightly improved systolic function compared to pre-bypass
study. There is still apical and anteroseptal hy
