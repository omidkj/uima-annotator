Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4588**]
Chief Complaint:
Wheezing and back pain.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Non Invasive Positive Pressure Ventilation

History of Present Illness:
85 yo woman with PMHx sig. for afib on coumadin, CAD s/p MI
([**2178**]), sCHF (EF 30-35% TTE [**2178**]), OA and remote hx of GIB
([**2178**]) and anxiety who preseted to [**Hospital1 **] ED in setting of new
onset of dyspnea and b/l infrascapular back pain.
.
Pt. was in USOH until the night prior to admission, when she
developed sudden onset upper back pain, bilateral in nature,
sharp [**7-30**] w/o radiation.  She tried to move around to make
herself feel better but unable to do so.  Around the same time,
she developed SOB. This was a rest, she had difficult time
taking a deep breath felt to be due to pain in her back.  Given
these symptoms, she called for help and EMS was called (lives at
ALF).
.
Of note, she reports symptoms of congestion, HA and intermittent
cough productive of clear sputum.  Pt. treated these with
decongestants with mild relief.  She denies fever, chills,
sweats.  She denies PND, orthopnea, or frank CP, n/v,
diaphoresis. Notes no recent dietary changes.  She does report
increasing hip pain for which she took endocet. No other
medication changes.
.
Initial VS in the ED BP 231/89 98.7 77 24 100% 15L nrb.  Was
treated with Nitro gtt (now at 0.07) with resultant BP 150/60
but continued to have increase WOB.  Labs were notable for
leukocytosis to 14K, HCT 32% and 2.4 INR, bicarb of 25.
CXR showed bibasilar opacities and given recent prodrome, she
was treated with Levofloxacin 750mg IV, Duonebs and NTG gtt as
above.  She was started on Bipap given persistent hypoxemia
(6LNC) and incr. WOB. UOP was 1600cc, thus no lasix was give.
BiPAP 40% and PS 10 PEEP .
.
On arrival to the MICU, SBPs in 220s and O2 sat 94 on NRB.  Pt.
appeared tachypneic, with increased WOB, unable to speak full
sentences.  ABG showed 7.51/37/87 on NRB. Noted to have b/l
crackles, + JVD.  Treated with Nitro gtt, lasix 20mg IV,
duonebs, methylprednisone of 125mg IV and placed on BiPAP 5/5 w/
ABG 2hrs later showing 7.55/34/89.  Pt. was c/o of subscapular,
b/l pain [**5-29**] and arthritis pain in her b/l hips.
.

Imaging:

CXR on admission:
IMPRESSION: Bibasilar opacities, right greater than left, may
indicate
developing infectious process.

CXR [**2-7**]:
FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no
relevant
change. Mild interstitial edema. Moderate cardiomegaly. No
pleural
effusions. No evidence of pneumonia.

CTA chest [**2-5**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. No acute aortic pathology or central pulmonary embolism.
2. Cardiomegaly with biatrial enlargement. Reflux of contrast in
the IVC,
suggestive of right heart failure.
3. Prominent mediastinal lymph nodes are nonspecific, but can be
seen in CHF;
these are larger and more numerous than on the prior study.
4. Wedge compression deformity in the mid thoracic spine is
increased since
[**2178**], although the exact acuity is unknown.

TTE:
The left atrium is markedly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF 65%). The right ventricular free wall is hypertrophied.
The right ventricular cavity is dilated with depressed free wall
contractility. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. An eccentric,
posteriorly directed jet of Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation
is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral
regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.] Due to the
eccentric nature of the regurgitant jet, its severity may be
significantly underestimated (Coanda effect). Moderate [2+]
tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed)
of [**2179-6-3**], left ventricular systolic function is
significantly improved.

Radiology Report CHEST (PA & LAT) Study Date of [**2181-2-11**] 2:25 PM

FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**2-7**], the patient has
taken a
somewhat better inspiration. There is continued enlargement of
the cardiac silhouette without vascular congestion or acute
pneumonia. Streaks of atelectasis are seen at the right base.
There is substantial wedging of a mid to lower thoracic vertebra
that was not well appreciated on the study of [**2179-6-18**].

Cardiovascular Report ECG Study Date of [**2181-2-9**]  11:48:22 PM
Atrial fibrillation with a controlled ventricular response. Left
axis deviation consist
