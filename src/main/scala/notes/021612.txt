Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5893**]
Chief Complaint:
Ascending cholangitis
ERCP

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
ERCP [**2180-7-28**]

History of Present Illness:
82 yo w/ hx of afib (on coumadin, which is currently on hold),
COPD, s/p ORIF of left femur fracture and reccent IVF filter
placement for a rectus sheath hematoma who is admitted from
[**Hospital3 4107**] for urgent ERCP in the setting of septic shock.

Patient was admitted to [**Hospital6 33**] after fall ahd SOB,
found to have left femur fx, requiring ORIF on [**2180-6-29**],
subsequently required about 10 units pRBC.  Course was also
complicated by AF/Aflutter. She was transferred from [**Hospital 38**]
Rehab.

Patiet was admitted from [**Hospital 38**] Rehab on [**7-14**] for evaluation
of acute shortness of breath and found to have have afib with
RVR.  During this hospitalization she was found to have a RML
and LLL infiltrates on CXR and was treated for a COPD
exacerbation initially with IV solumedrol and levaquin though
this was transitioned to PO prednisone and Cefazolin after
sputum culture grew E coli resistant to levaquin.  Culture also
grew [**Female First Name (un) **] and she was treated with diflucan/cefzolin for a
total 5 day course which ended on [**7-25**].  During this
hospitalization she was also found to have had an acute drop in
her HCT per report (but [**Hospital1 **] record has Hct 25.3-29 from
[**Date range (1) **]) and found to have a large rectus sheath hematoma on
CT ab/pelvis.  This finding lead to the discontinuation of her
coumadin, the starting of lovenox and the placement of an IVC
filter on [**7-19**].  She was seen by cardiology during this
admission for her afib w/ RVR which was felt to secondary to
acute anemia and COPD.  She was discharged on [**7-25**] back to rehab
in no respiratory distress and on 2L NC and was immediately
readmitted for complaints of transient unresponsiveness,
shortness of breath hypoxia.  She was given one 125 mg of IV
Solu-Medrol in the [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] and placed on BiPAP.

It is not clear from the medical record what her presenting
vital signs were, but by reprot she was found to have a normal
WBC (6.2) with a 36% bandemia and required pressor support with
levophed and was started on vancomycin/imipenem/cilastatin.  Her
presenting labs were notable for a TBili of 7 (D 4.11), AP 220,
ALT 125, AST 109.  Her HCT was 37.1 and plt 213.  Troponins were
initially elevated at 0.16 (subsequently trended down) with a
non-ischemic appearing EKG by report.  A CT abdomen was
performed (no RUQ US) and showed known gallstones without a
distended gallbladder or inflammatory changes to suggest acute
cholecystitis.  The common duct measured between 8 and 10 mm in
size with no obvious dilatation of intrahepatic ducts.

Over the next 24 hours levophed was weaned off and blood
cultures returned positive for e coli resulting in the
discontinuation of vancomycin.  A CTA Chest was also performed,
but did not show evidence of pulmonary embolist.  ECHO was
performed and showed a perserved EF by report but no offical
read is currently available.  Due to pressence of IVC filter
MRCP could not be obtained and the patient transferred for ERCP
evaluation.

IMAGING:
-[**7-28**] CXR:
There is mild-to-moderate cardiomegaly.  The aorta is tortuous.
The
mediastinum is widened due to tortuosity of the vessels.
Bibasilar
atelectasis are larger on the right side.  There is mild
vascular congestion.  Right greater than left perihilar and
right upper lobe opacities are worrisome for pneumonia.

-[**7-28**] CXR line placement:
ET tube tip is 4.1 cm above the carina.  Compared to prior study
there is mild interval increase in bilateral opacities.

-[**7-29**] CXR:
The patient has been extubated.  Mild-to-moderate cardiomegaly
and tortuous aorta are unchanged.  Small bilateral pleural
effusions are unchanged.  Bibasilar opacities larger on the
right side have minimally increased, could be due to atelectasis
or pneumonia.  Opacities in the upper lobes bilaterally right
greater than left have minimally increased likely infectious in
etiology.  There is mild vascular congestion.  The patient has
history of COPD.

-[**7-29**] CXR RIJ Line Placement:
FINDINGS:  In comparison with the earlier study of this date,
there has been placement
