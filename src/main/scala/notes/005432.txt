Admission Date:  [**2123-4-13**]       Discharge Date:  [**2123-4-20**]


Service:  CCU

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Chest pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname 46218**] is an 81-year-old male
with a history of hypertension and diabetes, who is status
post percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty on [**2123-4-7**].  The patient underwent successful percutaneous
transluminal coronary angioplasty stent of the proximal left
anterior descending artery and first diagonal and was
discharged to home with visiting nurses.  The patient was
noncompliant with discharge medications and did not continue
on Plavix therapy as instructed.

The patient presented to the Emergency Department on the
morning of admission with one hour of substernal chest pain,
[**4-17**]; similar to his prior myocardial infarction with
electrocardiogram showed ST elevations with
.................... in V1, V2, and V4 with reciprocal
depressions in II, III, and aVF.

The patient was taken emergently to cardiac catheterization
for presumed in-stent thrombosis.  The patient's procedure
was complicated by hemodynamic instability, ultimately
requiring intubation and maximal pressor support.  Angio-Jet
thrombectomy in both left anterior descending artery and
first diagonal for extensive thrombosis, in-stent dilation in
the left anterior descending artery with placement of a
Hepakote stent overlapping the aspects of his left anterior
descending artery stent.  The patient with profound
cardiogenic shock and was transferred to the Critical Care
Unit in tenuous condition.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Hypertension.
2.  Type 2 diabetes.
3.  Prostate cancer; status post surgery in [**2113**].
4.  Status post appendectomy.
5.  Coronary artery disease; status post stent to the left
anterior descending artery and first diagonal on [**2123-4-10**].

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS ON TRANSFER:
1.  Epinephrine drip.
2.  Dopamine drip.
3.  Levophed drip.
4.  Aspirin 325 mg p.o. once per day.
5.  Plavix drip.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives at home with his wife and
disabled son.  [**Name (NI) **] has a remote 5-pack-year tobacco history.
No alcohol.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Temperature was 90,
heart rate was 105, mean arterial blood pressure 61,
respiratory rate was 16, and oxygen saturation was 99% on
AC-750 100%, positive end-expiratory pressure 5.

PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:  White blood
cell count was 20.6, hematocrit 32.5, and platelets were 156.
Prothrombin time was 18, INR was 2.1, and partial
thromboplastin time 150.  Sodium was 119, potassium was 2.9,
chloride was 92, bicarbonate was 10, blood urea nitrogen was
25, creatinine was 1.2, and blood glucose was 924.  Calcium
was 5.9, phosphate was 3.5, and magnesium was 1.5.  Initial
creatine kinase was 164 with a peak of 5833 on the second day
of admission.  Lactate level was 8.3.  Arterial blood gas
revealed 7.3/123/97.

HOSPITAL COURSE BY ISSUE/SYSTEM:

1.  CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM:  (a)  Hemodynamics:  The patient
was maintained on initially full pressure support and
intra-aortic balloon pump to treat his cardiogenic shock.
The patient was able to be weaned to single pressor,
Levophed, within the first 24 hours.  He was maintained on an
intra-aortic balloon pump until [**2123-4-16**].  The patient was
maintained on aspirin and Plavix; initially ReoPro and
heparin.

The patient's low-density lipoprotein on a prior admission
was 102.  He was started on Lipitor 10 mg p.o. once per day
at the time of discharge.  He will need repeat liver function
tests in six weeks.  The patient was maintained on Plavix and
aspirin throughout his hospitalization stay.  His cardiac
enzymes continued to trend down.  His overall condition
improved.

(b)  Pump:  The patient underwent an echocardiogram on the
day prior to discharge which demonstrated an ejection
fraction of 25% to 30% with mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy, severe regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction, basal anterior hypokinesis, mid anterior
akinesis, basal anteroseptal hypokinesis, mid anteroseptal
akinesis, basal inferoseptal hypokinesis, mid inferoseptal
hypokinesis, anterior apex akinetic, septal apex hypokinetic,
inferior apex akinetic, apex dyskinetic, 1+ mitral
regurgitation, trivial physiologic pericardial effusion, and
mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.

The patient was maintained on anticoagulation given his areas
of akinesis and transitioned to Coumadin.  He will need
further management of his INR with discontinuation of his
heparin drip once his INR is 2 to 3.

The patient was maintained on an ACE inhibitor which was
titrated up to 37.5 (captopril) at the time of discharge.
The patient was slowly started on low-dose beta blocker
(carvedilol) 3.125 twice per day at the time of discharge.
Given his volume overload, his beta blocker was started with
plans to gently increase.

(c)  Rhythm:  The patient demonstrated a junctional
arrhythmia during his first three days status post procedure.
However, this resolved, and he was in a normal sinus rhythm
throughout the remainder of his hospitalization stay.

2.  INFECTIOUS DISEASE ISSUES:  The patient was noted to have
aspiration pneumonia at the time of cardiac catheterization
and was begun on treatment with levofloxacin and Flagyl.  The
patient had an elevated white blood cell count in the early
days of his admission; however, he remained afebrile.  He
should continue on six days of levofloxacin and Flagyl.

3.  PULMONARY ISSUES:  The patient with good respiratory
function and was able to weaned from the ventilator on [**4-16**]
without complications.  The patient did experience some
congestive heart failure with fluid overload and wheezing;
likely cardiac in origin.  Will continue to diurese him at
rehabilitation.  He was also started on albuterol and
Atrovent nebulizers as needed.

3.  ENDOCRINE ISSUES:  The patient presented with profound
hyperglycemia requiring an insulin drip.  The patient's
glucose values normalized within the first 24 hours of
admission, and he was well controlled using sliding-scale
insulin thereafter.

4.  CREATININE ISSUES:  The patient had a initial increase in
creatinine from baseline of 1 to a peak of 2.  He maintained
good urine output throughout his hospitalization.

5.  PROPHYLAXIS ISSUES:  The patient remained on a proton
pump inhibitor and intravenous heparin therapy while
hospitalized.

6.  DIET ISSUES:  A 2-gram sodium heart-healthy diet.

7.  PHYSICAL THERAPY ISSUES:  Physical therapy was initiated
and will need to be continued at rehabilitation.

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  Condition on discharge was stable.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
 1.  Aspirin 81 mg p.o. once per day.
 2.  Plavix 75 mg p.o. once per day.
 3.  Coreg 3.125 mg p.o. twice per day.
 4.  Captopril 37.5 mg p.o. three times per day.
 5.  Protonix 40 mg p.o. once per day.
 6.  Levofloxacin 500 mg p.o. once per day (times six days).
 7.  Flagyl 500 mg p.o. three times per day (times six days).
 8.  Warfarin 5 mg p.o. once per day (please monitor INR once
per day and stop heparin drip when INR is between 2 and 3 and
continue to check INR every three to four days and adjust
warfarin dose as needed).
 9.  Albuterol nebulizer q.4-6h. as needed.
10.  Atrovent nebulizer q.4-6h. as needed.
11.  Lasix 40 mg intravenously twice per day (times three
days).
12.  Lasix 40 mg p.o. p.o. twice per day (to start after
intravenous dose is completed).
13.  Quetiapine 25 mg p.o. q.h.s. as needed.
14.  Sliding-scale insulin.
15.  Lipitor 10 mg p.o. once per day.
16.  Heparin drip.

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS/FOLLOWUP:
1.  The patient was to follow up with his primary care
physician (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 11302**]; to be scheduled two weeks after
discharge from rehabilitation.
2.  The patient will need a follow-up echocardiogram in
approximately six weeks to evaluate cardiac function.
3.  The patient will need followup to determine length of
course of anticoagulation therapy.
4.  The patient will need follow-up liver function tests in
six weeks, as he was started on Lipitor 10 mg p.o. every day.
5.  The patient will need followup of INR while the patient
is on warfarin
