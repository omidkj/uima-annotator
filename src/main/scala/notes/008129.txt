Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1167**]
Chief Complaint:
Increasing dyspnoea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
This is a 78 year old male with a history of congestive heart
failure and EF of 20%, who is now presenting with increasing
dyspnea. He says that over the past 2-3 days, he has had
increasing dyspnea. Denies orthopnea or PND. Also states his
urine output has decreased, with associated poor PO intake. He
went to see his PCP given his symptoms. His PCP noted his blood
pressure to be 80s systolic. He also has a history of chronic
kidney disease with a baseline creatinine of 1.5, which has now
worsened to 2.1. He recently had a cardiac catheterization in
[**2112-10-21**], with BMS to the mid-LAD lesion.
In the ED, he continued to have lower blood pressures, with
systolic around 90. He was not dizzy or lightheaded; no fluids
were given in the setting of likely pulmonary edema. An EKG
showed no new changes; troponin was obtained which was at
baseline.
On the floor, he was saturating at 100% on 2 L. He denied
orthopnea, PND, or shortness of breath (was at baseline). Did
endorse continued leg swelling that he feels is above his
baseline.

ECG Study Date of [**2112-12-28**]  5:49:54 PM

Normal sinus rhythm. Intraventricular conduction delay with a
QRS duration of 114 milliseconds. Low voltage in the limb leads.
Poor R wave progression. Left atrial abnormality. Prior inferior
wall myocardial infarction and possible anterior wall myocardial
infarction. Compared to the previous tracing of [**2112-11-9**] no
diagnostic interval change.

TTE (Complete) Done [**2113-1-2**] at 11:03:01 AM
Conclusions
The left atrium is moderately dilated. The estimated right
atrial pressure is 10-20mmHg. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
and cavity size are normal. There is severe global left
ventricular hypokinesis with mild apical dyskinesis (LVEF = 20
%). No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. Tissue
Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling
pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size is normal
with moderate global free wall hypokinesis. [Intrinsic right
ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the
severity of tricuspid regurgitation.] The diameters of aorta at
the sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. No aortic regurgitation
is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There
is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild to moderate ([**1-23**]+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid
regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Normal biventricular cavity size with severe global
biventricular systolic dysfunction c/w multivessel CAD or other
diffuse process. Pulmonary artery hypertension. Moderate to
severe tricuspid regurgitation. Increased PCWP.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2112-8-15**],
the left ventricular cavity is smaller and the estimated
pulmonary artery systolic pressure is lower. The other findings
are similar.

LIVER ULTRASOUND:FINDINGS:  Gallstones.Unremarkable liver, with
normal Doppler findings.

Brief Hospital Course:
# Cardiomyopathy/Chronic systolic congestive heart failure: EF
of 20%. Unclear [**Name2 (NI) 28217**] of acute exacerbation but likely that pt
was failing at home and poor memory impaired adherance to
medication regimen. Lisinopril was stopped at his last admission
due to hyperkalemia and aldactone has been held. Weight 143
pounds on admission with 3-4+ peripheral ede
