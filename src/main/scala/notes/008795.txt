History of Present Illness:
70 year old woman with prior RCA stent three years ago, COPD,
hypertension, hyperlipidemia and breast cancer, recently came
off of plavix as she had been "feeling poorly on it", admitted
on [**2-7**] with chest pain x several days for elective cath in LGH.
Ruled out by troponins but EKGs did show depressions in the
'lateral leads'.
.
Pt was seen in office by cardiologist Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 61478**] w/ CP but no
SOB other than baseline. No fevers, chills, n/v, no abdominal
pain were reported. Last cath w/ stent 3 yrs back to RCA. She
has been having on and off pain, not related to exertion,
relieved w/o intervention, mostly in the back but radiating to
the front as well. Statin was recently changed to gemfibrizil as
pt felt lousy and pt had decided to stop taking plavix as it had
been more than 2 years since last cath. Had stress test last
month for evaluation for urethral stenting for hematuria which
was negative, so she went on to have the surgery.
.
Underwent diagnostic cath today via left radial: RCA diffusely
diseased with patent stent, patent OM but Cx occlusion more
distally, LAD with 70% proximal LAD vessel. Just after LV gram
around 11:15am, patient had severe chest and upper back pain
with drop in systolic pressure to 80. Pt also became unconcious.
LAD was found completely occluded. Attempts to get wire down LAD
were unsuccessful. IABP was placed in RFA. Pt was intubated and
currently on assist only. Ephedrine 10mg was given, and the pt
was started on Neo at 50mcg/min and angiomax (bivalirudin). SBP
107. Nurse reported LV gram to be "poor". She was transferred
straight to [**Hospital1 18**] cath lab via ground transport for attempt to
open LAD. VS on transfer: 108/50, HR 90 SR, intubated w/ assist,
"oxygenating well".
.
On review of systems, she denies any history of stroke, TIA,
deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time
of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. She denies recent fevers, chills or
rigors. S/he denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the
other review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of dyspnea on
exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema,
palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

Studies:
Cardiac Cath [**2101-2-9**]:
1. Cardiogenic shock, IABP in situ. [**Hospital **] transfer from
[**Hospital1 5979**]. Acutely occluded LAD with dissection following
attempted PTA.
2. LAD wired with difficulty. Successful BMS x 2 to proximal and
mid
LAD. Plaque shift resulting in occluded proximal LCX. LCX
successfully
stented with BMS. Integrilin IC bolus.
3. Right heart cath - PA 41/25, RV 47/10, RA mean 15. AO 88/31.
4. Intubated, sedated, ventilated, pressor support on transfer
to CCU.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Two vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Successful PCI of occluded / dissected proximal and mid LAD
using two
Integrity 3.0 x 30 mm overlapping BMS stents. Plaque shift into
proximal
LCX which required additional Integrity 2.5 x 26 mm BMS. Overall
good
result with patent LAD and LCX with TIMI 3 flow and no apparent
dissection.
3. Echocardiogram done during procedure to outrule pericardial
effusion
shows markedly depressed LV systolic function.
4. Transferred to CCU - intubated, sedated, ventilated, pressor
support,
IABP in situ.
