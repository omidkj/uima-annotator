Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3021**]
Chief Complaint:
Acute renal failure, severe hyperkalemia.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Bilateral nephrostomy tubes, [**2118-9-27**].

History of Present Illness:
71yo male with castrate resistant metastatic prostate cancer and
stage III CKD presents after being found to have acute renal
failure and hyperkalemia on routine labs at OSH.  Per pt, went
to oncologist yesterday with complaint of general weakness and
increased SOB at rest with resultant labs.  The patient states
he had noted no urine output for the last 5 days.  He also
admits to a productive cough for the last 8 weeks as well as new
SOB.  He is not on any home oxygen.  He also reports
intermittent nausea and occasional vomiting.  He was sent to
[**Hospital1 6687**] ED where he received kayexelate and lisinopril 40mg
prior to transfer to [**Hospital1 18**].
.
In ER, initial VS: T- 98.5, HR- 72, BP- 143/89, RR- 24, SaO2 89%
on RA.  Labs pertinent for BUN/Cr 107/13.7 with potassium of
6.7.  UA showed small leukocytes, 56 WBC, large blood and >182
RBCs.  CXR demonstrated mild pulmonary edema.  EKG with low
voltages but sinus rhythm at a rate of 80, NA/NI, no peaked
T-waves.  Bedside u/s revealed a small pericardial effusion with
no tamponade physiology.  U/S also demonstrated bilateral
massive hydronephrosis.  He was noted to have minimal foley
output.  For hyperkalemia, he was given dextrose, insulin,
calcium gluconate, and he received duonebs for SOB.  Urology was
consulted and recommended CT to assess for level of ureteral
obstruction and to continue foley decompression of the bladder.
Renal agreed with CT and urgent decompression of obstruction,
with no indication for urgent dialysis but to give kayexelate
for hyperkalemia and expect post-obstructive diuresis. Oncology
was consulted and stated they would follow along.  IR agreed to
take patient for urgent bilateral percutaneous nephrostomy
placement.  Vital signs on transfer were HR 90, afebrile,
satting 92-94% on 2L NC, 88% on RA, BP 141/78.
.
In the ICU, initial vital signs were T- 97.3, HR- 85, BP 127/70,
RR- 17, SaO2- 91% on NC.  Patient reports symptom improvement
after IR procedure.  Denies fevers, chills with some shortness
of breath that has also improved.

CXR [**2118-9-27**]: IMPRESSION:
1. Moderate right pleural effusion.
2. Bibasilar opacities at the lung bases, likely atelectasis,
cannot exclude superinfection.
3. Engorgement of the vessels centrally.
4. Enlarged cardiac silhouette.
.
[**2118-9-27**] CT ABD/PELVIS: IMPRESSION:
1. Worsening moderate-to-severe bilateral hydronephrosis and
proximal
hydroureter, with the ureters compressed and/or encased by
extensive
retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy which may be slightly increased
in size compared to prior.
2. Bilateral large pleural effusions, worse on the right with
bibasilar atelectasis.
3. Small amount of free fluid in the pelvis with presacral
edema.
4. T12 and L1 vertebral body sclerotic osseous metastases,
similar to outside CT from [**2118-7-19**]. Mild loss of height
of T12 vertebral body is stable compared to [**2118-7-19**];
however, is new from [**2117-11-11**].
6. Cholelithasis.
7. Diverticulosis.
.
[**2118-9-28**] CXR: IMPRESSION: Worsening of pleural effusions and
pulmonary edema that may be due in part to technical differences
between this and the prior study.
.
[**2118-9-30**] CXR: IMPRESSION:
1. Stable bilateral pleural effusions, moderate on the right and
small on the left. Improved pulmonary edema.
2. Stable mediastinal widening corresponding with known
adenopathy.
.
[**2118-9-30**] ECHO: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy,
LVEF>55%, mildly dilated RV, ascending aorta is mildly dilated,
at least mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.

Brief Hospital Course:
71yo man with metastatic prostate CA and stage III CKD who was
transferred from OSH for [**Last Name (un) **] and hyperkalemia due obstructive
uropathy.  Bilateral percutaneous nephrostomy tubes were placed
[**2118-9-28**].
.
# Acute kidney injury due to obstruction: Resolved s/p bilateral
nephrostomy tube placement [**2118-9-28**].  Urology and Nephrology
consulted.  Post-obstructive diuresis slowing.  Aspirin held
because of macroscopic hematuria post-nephrostomy placement.
.
# Hyperkalemia: Resolved s/p Kayexylate, insulin/glucose,
calcium.
.
# Prostate CA: Started abiraterone [**2118-9-26**].  Leuprolide given
last week.  XRT started Monday [**2118-10-3**], finishes Friday
[**2118-10-7**].  Continued prednisone, but dose increased for COPD
exacerbation, plant to taper down slowly to baseline 5mg [**Hospital1 **].
Restarted abiraterone (Zytiga) 1000mg PO daily [**2118-10-3**] per
primary oncologist.
.
# Hypoxia and right-sided pleural effusion: CXR with moderate
new right pleural effusion and vascular congestion.  Cough
x6wks.  Sputum culture grew Moraxella catarrhalis, started
levofloxacin for possible pneumonia.  Echo normal.  COPD
exacerbation given prominent wheeze, cough, and smoking history.
 O2 needs resolved since increase in prednisone.  Continued
prednisone taper.  Changed nebs to prn and discharged with a
nebulizer.  Continued levofloxacin, renally dosed, for Moraxella
pneumonia.  Held diuretics while auto-diuresing.
.
# Pulmonary edema: Improved with post-obstructive diuresis.
Held on furosemide while auto-diuresing.  Now off O2.
.
# Hypertension: Outpatient
