History of Present Illness:
Ms [**Known lastname 3501**] is a 61 yo W s/p St. [**Male First Name (un) 923**] aortic valve replacement for
severe AI by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2230**] in [**2138**] who presented to her PCP five
days ago for annual checkup and for SOB. At that time, she had
experienced months of increasing SOB, notable over the past
several weeks. Echo was obtained which showed valve dysfunction.
She was thus taken to cath where fluoro demonstrated a St. [**Male First Name (un) 923**]
aortic valve w/ one dysfunctional valve. She is transferred to
[**Hospital1 18**] for further care.

Pertinent Results:
Echo [**6-27**]: The left atrium is moderately dilated. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. A
bileaflet aortic valve prosthesis is present. The transaortic
gradient is higher than expected for this type of prosthesis.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial effusion.
Head CT [**6-29**]: No acute intracranial hemorrhage, mass effect, or
major vascular territorial infarction.
Head MRA [**6-29**]: Normal MRA of the head.
Echo [**6-29**]: Thickening of the anterior leaflet of the mechanical
aortic valve. Likely frozen leaflet in the "closed" position.
Echo [**6-30**]: Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and
systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal
technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be
fully excluded. A mechanical aortic valve prosthesis is present.
The aortic prosthesis appears well seated, with normal
leaflet/disc motion and transvalvular gradients. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. Compared with the prior study (images
reviewed) of [**2142-6-29**], the overall findings are similar (a peak
gradient was not obtained on the prior study of last evening,
but valve mobility is similar). The aortic valve gradients are
reduced from the studies of the morning of [**2142-6-29**].

Brief Hospital Course:
As mentioned in the HPI, Ms. [**Known lastname 3501**] was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] on
Heparin and admitted with immediate cardiac surgery
consultation. Initially obtained Echo, ECG, blood work and
cultures. Heparin was continued and she awaited thrombolysis. A
repeat Echo was performed (TEE) which revealed a "frozen" valve
leaflet in the closed position secondary to a thrombus. On
hospital day four she was transferred to the CSRU for
thrombolysis with tPA. During tPA she developed new aphasia and
a head CT was performed. Followed by an immediate neurology
consult. CT was negative and she then underwent a MRA. Which was
also negative. Heparin was continued and she was then started on
Coumadin. Which was titrated for a goal INR of [**3-2**].5. She
remained in the CSRU for several days secondary to requiring BP
support with Neo-Synephrine. On hospital day six she was
transferred to the telemetry floor. Her aphasia following tPA
slowly improved and resolved (most likely representing TIA from
embolus). Over the next several days she remained in the
hospital for anticoagulation and awaited her INR to become
therapeutic. She was discharged on hospital day 11 with
follow-up in [**Hospital 197**] Clinic with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3497**] on Monday [**7-9**]. As
well as other appropriate follow-up appointments.
