Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1253**]
Chief Complaint:
hemoptysis, dyspnea, chest pain


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
The pt is a 32yo man with a h/o IVDU who went to
[**Hospital1 **] ED for evaluation of hemoptysis, dyspnea, and
chest pain. The pt has had 3 days of cough with hemoptysis and
dyspnea, which has limited him substantially. He coughs up
"globs" of bright red blood, but denies any clots. He has had an
associated wheeze, and acknowledges bilateral sharp pleuritic
8/10 chest pain with coughing. He did have a fever as well, a
few days prior to the onset of these symptoms, but has continued
to have chills and sweats since then. He does acknowlege most
recent IVDU 10 days ago.
.
He went to OSH ED for evaluation, where he was noted to be
febrile to 104, diaphoretic, and hypoxic to 88% on RA. He was
given Tylenol, and blood Cx were drawn x3. CXR showed multiple
bilateral nonspecific rounded lung opacities, and CTA showed no
PE, but revealed patchy bilateral parenchymal opacities
throughout both lungs with suggestion of cavitation, most likely
due to septic emboli, with extensive mediastinal
lymphadenopathy. ECG was unremarkable. Labs revealed WBC 12.9
with neutrophilic predominance, and Na 123. He was given Zosyn
3.375mg IV, Vancomycin 1g IV, and 2L NS IVF, and transferred to
[**Hospital1 18**] ED. On arrival to the ED, VS - Temp 99.8F, BP 132/76, HR
98, R 18, SaO2 99% 4L NC. Blood Cx sent x2, Fungal Cx also sent.
UA negative. SBP decreased to 80s, so he received an additional
3L IVF, and a RIJ CVL sepsis line was placed. Labs were sent and
he is admitted to the MICU for further care.
.
On the floor, the pt also notes mild upper abdominal pain,
epigastric, without nausea, or vomiting. He does acknowledge
diarrhea, but denies any melena, hematochezia, or BRBPR. He also
has a right wrist fracture that he sustained after a fall [**2-12**]
days ago, which is currently casted.

OSH CTA CHEST: FINDINGS: No evidence of PE. Multiple bilateral
rounded opacities throughout both lungs, soome of which appear
slightly cavitary, could represent septic emboli. Neoplastic
process difficult to exclude. Right lung base infiltrate. Trace
right pleural effusion. Heart and great vessels normal.
Extensive mediastinal adenopathy. Visualized abdomen normal.
Soft tissues and bones are normal. IMPRESSION: No evidence of
PE. Patchy bilateral parenchymal opacities throughout both lungs
with suggestion of cavitation. Most likely due to septic emboli.
Extensive mediastinal lymphadenopathy.
.
OSH CXR: FINDINGS: Multiple bilateral rounded opacities.
Nonspecific, could relate to infectious, inflammatory, or
neoplastic process. No cardiomegaly. Mediastinal silhouette
normal. No fractures. IMPRESSION: Multiple bilateral nonspecific
rounded lung opacities.
.
TEE [**2167-6-10**]:
The esophagus was intubated on the third attempt due to a
prominent gag reflex. The patient was dry retching during the
majority of the procedure. The TEE was performed and five
minutes after the procedure ended the cardiology fellow and MICU
team noticed that he was hypoxic with O2 sats between 80-90,
tachycardiac, hypertensive and wheezing on examination. He
responded to 100% O2 face mask. Methemoglobinemia was ruled out
on the basis of an ABG with birght red blood and a METHgb level
of 0. He responded to the oxygen, IV morphine, and 10 mg IV
lasix. We felt that he most likely had an aspiration event given
prominent gagging during the procedure.
.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
The right ventricular cavity is moderately dilated with normal
free wall contractility. There is abnormal septal
motion/position consistent with right ventricular
pressure/volume overload. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion. No masses or
vegetations are seen on the aortic valve. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
structurally normal. No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral
valve. No mitral regurgitation is seen. Trivial mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is a large, multilobulated
vegetation on the tricuspid valve (measuring 0.6 x 2.9 cm in
largest dimensions) with associated flail tricuspid valve
leaflet and torn chordae. No definite tricuspid valve abcess is
seen (can not be fully exlcu
