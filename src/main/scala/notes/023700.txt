Date of Birth:   [**2067-7-27**]       Sex:  F

Service:  CARDIOTHOR

REASON FOR ADMISSION:  The patient is a 65 year old woman who
is a postoperative admission; she is admitted directly to the
Operating Room for a mitral valve replacement and is seen in
preadmission testing.  The patient's chief complaint was a
decreased exercise tolerance and an increase in fatigue since
[**Month (only) 359**] of last year.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 65 year old
woman who was in her usual state of health until [**2132-1-23**] when she began to experience decreased exercise
tolerance.  She also developed substernal chest pain in
[**2132-11-22**] for which she was brought to the Emergency
Room of [**Hospital1 69**].  She ruled in
for a myocardial infarction and was found to be in mild
congestive heart failure at that time.  She was also found to
have mitral regurgitation and atrial fibrillation.  She has
continued to have decreased exercise tolerance since her
myocardial infarction and was referred to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for
evaluation of mitral valve repair.

A cardiac echocardiogram done in [**2133-2-22**], showed a
left atrial enlargement, right atrial enlargement and
ejection fraction of 55%, focal root and ascending aortic
calcifications, three plus mitral regurgitation and mild
tricuspid regurgitation.  Mild pulmonary hypertension.

Cardiac catheterization done in [**2132-11-22**], showed a
right dominant system with occlusion of the distal left
anterior descending status post thrombectomy and percutaneous
transluminal coronary angioplasty of the distal left anterior
descending at that time.

LABORATORY:  White blood cell count 4.7, hematocrit 37.5,
platelets 291.  Sodium 138, potassium 4.4, chloride 101, CO2
29, BUN 20, creatinine 0.8, INR 3.0.

Chest x-ray with no pleural effusions, resolution of
congestive heart failure pattern.  Degenerative changes of
skeletal structures, left atrial enlargement consistent with
history of mitral valve disease.  No active pulmonary
process.

Electrocardiogram is sinus rhythm, rate of 66, PR is 180; QRS
100, QT 464.  T waves in III and F with non-specific ST
changes.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  As stated previously, the patient was a
direct admission to the Operating Room where she underwent a
mitral valve replacement with a #31 [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1495**] [**Male First Name (un) 923**] Mechanical
Valve and a Mays.  Her bypass times was 140 minutes with a
cross clamp time of 103 minutes.  Please see the Operating
Report for full details and summary.  She had an mitral valve
replacement and Mays.  She tolerated the procedure well and
was transferred from the Operating Room to the Cardiothoracic
Intensive Care Unit.  At the time of transfer, the patient
was in a sinus rhythm at 74 beats per minute with a mean
arterial pressure of 64.  She had Neo-Synephrine at one point
at 5 mics per kg per minute and propofol at 20 mics per kg
per minute.

The patient did well in the immediate postoperative period,
however, within an hour of arrival in the Intensive Care
Unit, she did start to have a problem with excessive chest
tube bleeding.  Her ACT was mildly elevated for which she was
treated with Protamine.  Her INR was mildly elevated for
which she was treated with fresh frozen plasma.  In addition,
the patient received two units of packed red blood cells and
a bag of platelets, following which the patient's chest tube
drainage dissipated.  The patient remained hemodynamically
stable throughout that period.

On postoperative day one, the patient continued to be
hemodynamically stable.  Her sedation was discontinued at
that time.  She was weaned from the ventilator and
successfully extubated.  Her chest tubes and Swan-Ganz
catheter however were left in place at that time for further
monitoring.

On postoperative day two, the patient remained on a low dose
Neo-Synephrine infusion to maintain an adequate blood
pressure.  She remained hemodynamically stable.  Her beta
blockade was begun in the late afternoon of postoperative day
two following a weaning of her Neo-Synephrine as was her
diuretic therapy.  Additionally, the patient was begun on
Coumadin on postoperative day two.

On postoperative day three, the patient remained
hemodynamically stable off of all vasoactive intravenous
infusions.  Her chest tubes were removed as was her temporary
pacing wires and she was transferred to the floor for
continuing postoperative care and cardiac rehabilitation.

Over the next several days, the patient had an uneventful
postoperative course.  She received Coumadin daily with an
attempt to increase her INR to the therapeutic range of 3.0
to 3.5.  Additionally she was on a heparin infusion during
that period of time.  With the assistance of the nursing
staff and the Physical Therapy staff, the patient's activity
level was increased.

On postoperative day seven, the patient's INR had increased
to 1.9.  Up to that point, she had received Coumadin 5 mg
times three consecutive days, followed by Coumadin 7.5 mg on
[**5-21**] and 30th.  At this point, we anticipate that the
patient's INR will be in the mid 2.0 range on Saturday, [**5-23**], and at that point she will be considered for discharge to
home with daily INR checks until she reaches her goal INR of
3.0 to 3.5.

At the time of this dictation, the patient's physical
examination is as follows:  Vital signs with temperature of
99.0 F., heart rate 70 in sinus rhythm; blood pressure 95/45;
respiratory rate 20; O2 saturation of 96% on room air.
Weight preoperatively was 73 kilograms.  At discharge her
weight is 75.8 kilograms.

Laboratory data was white blood cell count of 8.7, hematocrit
29, sodium 142, potassium 4.5, chloride 106, CO2 31, BUN 12,
creatinine 0.7, gluco
