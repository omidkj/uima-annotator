who was admitted from the Emergency Department on [**2163-4-23**]
complaining of three to four [**Known lastname **] of chest pain prior to
admission associated with shortness of breath and nausea and
vomiting.  He ruled in for a non ST segment myocardial

7. Lasix.
8. Allopurinol.


HOSPITAL COURSE:  Briefly, the patient was admitted to the
Cardiology [**Hospital Unit Name 196**] Service where he underwent a cardiac
catheterization which found three vessel disease with an
ejection fraction of approximately 35 percent.  An
echocardiogram showed 3+ mitral regurgitation.  On the
Cardiology Service, due to his chronic renal insufficiency
with a baseline creatinine of 7.4, he was started on Natrecor
and Lasix drip and was consulted by the Renal Service.
During this time, he went into some paroxysmal atrial
fibrillation and was treated with a heparin drip by
Cardiology.

Cardiac Surgery was consulted on [**2163-5-3**] and agreed that a
coronary artery bypass grafting was indicated.  However, the
patient was to have several trials of two to three [**Known lastname **] worth
of hemodialysis in order to optimize the patient for surgery.
The risks and benefits were explained to the patient and the
family by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and the patient had a repeat
echocardiogram on [**2163-5-5**] which showed an EF of 20 percent
and the mitral regurgitation had gone down to 1-2+.

The patient was taken to the Operating Room on [**2163-5-6**] where
he underwent an RF Maze procedure with radiofrequency ablation
of the pulmonary veins for atrial fibrillation and
CABG times four with LIMA to the LAD,
saphenous vein graft to the diagonal 1, saphenous vein graft
to the OM1, and saphenous vein graft to the OM2 branch.  The
procedure was uncomplicated until the end of the operation
where after the patient was decannulated from cardiopulmonary
bypass, he went into an acute right ventricular failure and
had to be reheparinized and placed back on cardiopulmonary
bypass.  His total cross-clamp time was 87 minutes and his
total cardiopulmonary bypass time was 128 minutes.  An intra-
aortic balloon pump was placed intraoperatively.  Please
refer to the operative note for specific details and this
facilitated him coming off of cardiopulmonary bypass.

He was transported to the Cardiac Surgery Recovery Unit in
critical condition on milrinone, Levophed, epinephrine,
vasopressin, and Amiodarone drips.  Later on that night, the
patient went into ventricular tachycardia and was able to be
successfully cardioverted out of it.  The patient had his
epinephrine drip weaned off and an Electrophysiology consult
was obtained.  The patient was also being followed closely by
Renal and CVVH was instituted on postoperative [**Known lastname **] number
two.

Around postoperative [**Known lastname **] number three, the patient had
another ventricular tachycardia episode which was
successfully cardioverted at the bedside.  An echocardiogram
did not show any significant change in his cardiac status and
the milrinone and epinephrine drips were weaned off.

On [**2163-5-10**], the patient was seen by Electrophysiology
who recommended that the patient go to the Cardiac
Catheterization Laboratory to evaluate any possible coronary
arterial etiology for his recurrent postoperative ventricular
tachycardia.  During the catheterization, the patient was
shown to have an occlusion of his LAD territory, OM1, and OM2
territory.  The diagonal 1 graft was patent.  The patient
underwent percutaneous angioplasty of the LAD and the OM3
branches in the Catheterization Laboratory.  Because the
patient's platelet count had decreased to the mid40s, it was
felt that the patient could have heparin-induced
thrombocytopenia.  Hence, all heparin was stopped in the
patient's line and he underwent an Argatroban drip therapy.

The first HIT test came back negative; however, subsequent
test came back positive and the patient had heparin-induced
thrombocytopenia.  The patient was maintained intermittently
on epinephrine and Levophed drips in addition to lidocaine
and Amiodarone.  The patient had been started on tube feeds
on [**2163-5-12**], but was unable to tolerate this well.  It was
noted on LFT examination that the patient had a total
bilirubin of 4.5.  The patient went into another episode of
ventricular tachycardia on [**2163-5-13**] associated with paroxysms
of atrial fibrillation.  He was able to be successfully
cardioverted out of both ventricular tachycardia and out of
atrial fibrillation with bedside cardioversion.  His CVVH was
being tolerated with no net fluid removal at that time.
However, the patient intermittently continued to have
episodes of ventricular tachycardia on [**2163-5-15**].

On [**2163-5-16**], the intra-aortic balloon pump was able to be
successfully taken out.  On LFT examination, it was noted
that his alkaline phosphatase had increased from a level of
approximately 270 from [**2163-5-10**] all the way up to well
over 1,000 by [**2163-5-18**].  A GI consultation  was obtained and
an ultrasound was obtained of the abdomen which did not show
any evidence of cholecystitis, no evidence of extrahepatic
biliary obstruction.  However, the GI consult felt that this
was consistent with an episode of cholestatic jaundice and
recommended that the patient be placed on Ursodiol therapy.

Meanwhile, the patient's heparin-induced antibody from the
second sample was found to be positive, as mentioned
previously.  The patient was maintained on an Argatroban drip
and was requiring intermittent doses of Levophed and
Pitressin.  The patient was still on a ventilator but was
able to be changed to CPAP with pressure support by
postoperative [**Known lastname **] number ten.

However, on [**2163-5-21**], the patient was given a trial of
extubation and failed approximately ten minutes thereafter,
needing to be urgently reintubated.  The patient was
maintained on the pressors, as mentioned.  However, the
Levophed was able to be subsequently weaned off by [**2163-5-23**]
and the patient was just maintained on Amiodarone and Neo-
Synephrine.  The lidocaine had been weaned off per
Electrophysiology's recommendations.  However, because the
patient's alkaline phosphatase had continued to stay in the
mid-thousand range and the total bilirubin had progressively
steadily increased to 20, a Surgery consult was obtained and
a follow-up ultrasound was obtained on [**2163-5-25**] which
actually showed distended extrahepatic biliary tree up to 1.5
cm, felt to be consistent with an extrahepatic biliary
cholestatic versus obstructive process.  An ERCP was
recommended by General Surgery.  GI was following and felt
that this would be too high risk given the patient's
recurrent episodes of ventricular tachycardia and unstable
hemodynamics.  The patient was maintained on Ursodiol therapy
at this time.
