CXR: [**2132-7-27**]
FINDINGS: Lateral blunting of the right costophrenic sulcus is
stable and unchanged compared to the most recent examination.
This is likely scondary to pleural thickening. The cardiac
silhouette is moderately enlarged. The pulmonary vasculature is
mildly prominent. Prominence of the central pulmonary arteries
is unchanged compared to the most recent examination. Right
apical pleural thickening is unchanged. A small calcified focus
projected over the right clavicle consistent with calcified
granuloma is also unchanged compared to previous examinations.
The lungs are grossly clear. There are no pleural effusions. The
soft tissues and osseous structures are unremarkable.
IMPRESSION: No direct evidence of CHF. Evidence of probably
interstial lungn disease in the mid-lower lungs with associated
prominent hila/bilateral lymphadenopathy. Pulmonary arterial
prominence likely reflects underlying pulmonary hypertension.
Relatively unchanged examination compared to most recent
radiographs of [**2131-9-4**].

oliguria improved with volume and natrecor. He was followed
closely by Renal. He was extubated on POD #2. His creatinine
continued to worsen, he continued on diuril and torsemide and a
dialysis catheter was placed. CVVH was started on [**8-13**] to aid
in fluid removal. He was started on amiodartone and coumadin for
atrial fibrillation. His kidney function and urine output
improved and CVVH was stopped. He was transferred to the floor
on POD #12. He was started on vancomycin and levofloxacin for
erythema of his sternal incision, which improved and the vanco
was discontinued. He was ready for discharge to rehab on [**8-25**]
