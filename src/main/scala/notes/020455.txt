History of Present Illness:
52yo M with h/o COP, dCHF, PE not on Coumadin who presents from
home with hypoxia and SOB x1 week, per advice of his PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **].
[**Last Name (STitle) **]. [**Location (un) 1110**] [**Location (un) 269**] informed him of recent abnormal labs incl Na
133, Cr 2.0 and Ca [**38**].6.  He has been increasingly hypoxic and
dyspneic this past week with sats [**Location (un) 1131**] between 86%-90% on
room air. He unfortunately continues to refuse home O2 for his
chronic lung and heart disease. Pt states today sat dipped to
73%. Also endorses worsening bilat leg swelling x few weeks.
Denies fevers, CP, n/v/d, cough.
.
In the ED, initial vs were T 98 HR 92 BP 90/37 RR 16 O2 sat 88%
on RA. Pt was noted to have diffuse wheezing, bilat LE pitting
edema to knees with diffuse redness.  Pt was given nebs and 125
mg solumedrol for COPD exacerbation.  Of note, pt is on
Prednisone 20mg daily at home.  BNP was 139.  LENIs showed no
DVT, however it was a  poor study.  CXR showed some interstitial
edema, left pleural effusion.  EKG showed NSR, mild ST
depressions in V4-V5. TnT was 0.03.  Cr was noted to be 2.5
(baseline of 1.0).  Since pt has h/o PE not on Coumadin, there
was suspicion of PE, however, given renal failure, CTA not
pursued.  Lactate was 6.2, then went down to 4.5 after 1L NS.
Pt was planned to be given Vanc for LE cellulitis (though not
actually given prior to transfer) and Levaquin for possible
pneumonia.  Pt also received Dilaudid IV 1mg x2 for pain.  Pt
was transferred to ICU for close monitoring of respiratory
status and possible sepsis given elev lactate.  On transfer, VS
were T 98.0 HR 90 RR 20 BP 113/56 O2 sat 94 % on 4L NC.
.
Upon arrival to the ICU, pt is doing well, but complains of
lower ext pain.  States he is on Oxycontin and Oxycodone at home
but did not receive any since early this morning.  Did get some
IV Dilaudid in the ED, with good response.  Pt denies fevers.
States his breathing is reasonably well currently.  Denies
worsening of his baseline cough.  Denies sick contacts.

Imaging:
CXR ([**9-11**]): IMPRESSION: Relatively stable bilateral upper lung
patchy opacities are consistent with history of cryptogenic
organizing pneumonia. However, there is a new focal
opacification in right middle lobe, atelectasis versus
infectious process.
.
Ultrasound bilateral lower extremities ([**9-11**]): IMPRESSION:
Extremely limited evaluation given patient's body habitus and
inability to properly position the patient due to patient
discomfort. The common femoral veins could not be assessed
bilaterally. Very limited assessment of the superficial femoral
veins and left popliteal vein demonstrate no clear evidence of
thrombus in these veins, however compression was not assessed.
Otherwise, DVT can not be excluded.

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 52yo M with h/o COP, dCHF, PE not on Coumadin who
presents from home with hypoxia/SOB as well as bilateral lower
extremity edema, erythema and pain.
.
# Hypoxia: Hypoxic hypercarbic respiratory failure.  DDx on
admission included ACS, pneumonia, COP flare, CHF exacerbation,
PE, or volume overload.  The EKG in the ED showed ST depressions
in V4-V5 and TnT 0.03, although the patient denied chest pain
and showed no further symptoms, increased troponin level, or EKG
changes.  The troponin was therefore thought to represent demand
ischemia.  A CXR showed a new infiltrate, however, the patient
had no fever or cough.   PCP less likely given Bactrim ppx.
Legionella testing came back negative.  He was treated with a
single dose each of levofloxacin and vancomycin, but these were
discontinued given his rapid improvement.  Alternatively, this
can be a COP/BOOP flare given his underlying chronic lung
disease.  He was given one dose of increased prednisone, then
maintained on his home dose.  PE was also on the differential,
with immobility [**3-6**] recent hospitalizations, increased LE edema.
 Ultrasound of the lower extremities was negative, which is
reassuring, however this was a poor study given body habitus.
His pain resolved with diuresis. CTA was not able to be pur
