Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5018**]
Chief Complaint:
brought to hospital for speech difficulties

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
s/p IV tPA


History of Present Illness:
The pt is a 81 year-old right-handed man with a history of
HTN, DM, and CKD who presents with sudden onset of aphasia.
According to his family, he was at home, talking to his wife and
friends with no difficulty between 2:30 and 3pm.  Around 3pm
they
went to get into the car to go visit his son.  His wife turned
to
him, and asked him if he was going to put on his seatbelt, and
he
responded by saying 'ah..ah...ah' and did not seem to be able to
produce any other words.  His wife decided to continue the plan
to drive to see his son, but when he arrived and his children
saw
him and heard the story, they immediately took him to the
nearest
hospital.  There he was noted to have minimal speech, producing
either no response or stating 'I don't know' in response to most
questions.  By report he did not initially have any face or arm
weakness.  He had a NCHCT which showed no signs of hemorrhage.
The outside hospital initially discussed transferring him for IA
tPA, however on discussion with our hospital, as he was still
within the IV tPA window, the recommendation was to start with
IV
tPA, which he recieved at 17:30.  According to his family, while
he was receiving the bolus, he initially did develop a slight
right facial droop that then improved.  They report that since
the tPA he seems slightly more alert, and seems to have improved
comprehension of commands, but still has significant difficulty
producing speech.

Mr. [**Known lastname **] was recently discharged following a week long
hospitalization for fever and pneumonia.  He was admitted on
[**6-12**]
with fever to 101, found to have strep viridans pneumonia and
bacteremia.  He was treated with ceftriaxone and azithromycin,
followed by a course of levofloxacin.  During his
hospitalization
he underwent an echocardiogram which showed no signs of
vegetations, and his blood cultures cleared.  Since discharge
from rehab on [**6-23**], he reportedly had been doing well at home.

Neurologic:
-Mental Status: Alert, answers 'I don't know' in response to all
orientation questions, but can select the correct answers when
given choices.  Unable to repeat even single words correctly
(says 'tat' for cat, 'gog' for dog, and is unable to even
attempt
multi-word or multi-syllable options).  When asked to write it
is
shaky, difficult to read, looks like 'Rhughh Hally' when asked
to
write his name.  Answers 'I don't know', and then starts
counting
when asked to read.  Unable to identify any objects on the NIH
stroke card, but points to them and counts them correctly.  When
asked to point to a specific object, or if an object is present,
states 'I don't know.'  Able to follow simple midline commands
'stick out your tongue' and simple, but not complex appendicular
commands (can show right thumb, and can pick up left hand, but
is
unable to show two fingers, instead just starts counting his
fingers).

-Cranial Nerves:
I: Olfaction not tested.
II: PERRL 2 to 1 mm and brisk.  Poor cooperation with visual
field testing, but appears to look towards moving targets in all
fields though seems to have difficulty tracking. Unable to fully
visualize fundi.
III, IV, VI: EOMI without nystagmus.
V: Facial sensation intact to light touch.
VII: Slight right facial droop
VIII: Hearing intact to finger-rub bilaterally.
IX, X: Palate elevates symmetrically.
[**Doctor First Name 81**]: 5/5 strength in trapezii and SCM bilaterally.
XII: Tongue protrudes in midline.

-Motor: Normal bulk, tone throughout. No clear pronator drift
bilaterally, but has difficulty with positioning.  Slight
resting
tremor noted in the right hand. No asterixis noted.

Plantar response was flexor bilaterally.

-Coordination: No clear dysmetria, however has difficulty
targeting objects, instead simply touches his nose, and then
reaches towards the midline, then back to his nose, rather than
attempting to touch the target.

Diagnostic Studies:

EKG: no acute ST or t wave changes, a. fib noted on one of the
EKGs

CXR ([**2172-6-27**]): Mild-to-moderate cardiomegaly, and mild vascular
congestion. No evidence of pneumonia.

MRI/MRA head and neck: Area of acute infarction within the left
frontal lobe, with numerous, probably chronic infarcts
distributed within both cerebral hemispheres. Likely
superimposed amyloid angiopathy. Minor atherosclerotic vascular
abnormalities

CT head ([**6-28**]): Left occipital and left frontal intraparenchymal
hematomas, with trace right subarachnoid blood

CT head ([**6-29**]): No change in left frontal and occipital
parenchymal hemorrhages with surrounding mild edema and minimal
subarachnoid hemorrhage

CT head ([**7-1**]): Slight increase in the smallest hemorrhage in the
right frontal lobe. Slight decrease in left frontal and
occipital parenchymal hemorrhages. These hemorrhages are likely
related to underlying amyloid angiopathy

CT head ([**7-3**]): final read pending. There does not appear to be
any changes [**Last Name (un) **] in hemorrhage size since prior CT.

TTE: Suboptimal image quality. Mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with preserved global biventricular systolic
function. Dilated ascending aorta. No definite structural
cardiac source of embolism identified. No ASD or PFO. Left
Atrium mildly dilated.




Brief Hospital Course:
  Mr. [**Known lastname **] was transferred from OSH after receiving IV tpA for
acute onset of nonfluent aphasia. Upon arrival here, he was
noted to have a nonfluent aphasia and mild right hemiparesis. He
was initially admitted to the ICU for monitoring s/p tPA. He
clinically remained stable. He had MRI which not only showed the
expected L MCA stroke (he had an acute left fronto-temporal
stroke), but also an acute right cerebellar stroke. He was also
noted to have multiple old infarcts. There was no flow limiting
stenosis or thrombus noted on MRA. He had no documented history
of a. fib, but there was one EKG which looked like a. fib. Given
this and the b/l infarcts noted, he likely has cardioembolic
etiology of his strokes. TTE was performed and did not show any
ASD or PFO, nor any clear cardiac etiology of stroke. Optimally,
he would be anticoagulated for the likely cardioem
