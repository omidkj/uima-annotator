History of Present Illness:
History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 55yo F w/hx of MS, severe COPD presented as a
transfer from [**Hospital3 **] for R femur fracture after walking
down the stairs in her house.  In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, she was felt to
be in respiratory distress and was admitted to the ICU for
further monitoring.
.
The patient states that she was walking down her stairs on the
day PTA [**2164-10-12**] when she felt a snapping sensation.  She had no
pain and was able walk down the stairs and to her chair.  She
fell asleep and arose the next morning unable to stand.  She
went to the [**Hospital3 **] ED where she was found to have a R
hairline femur fracture with lipohemarthrosis.  She was then
transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED for further management.
.
In the ED, initial vs were: T 98.3 P 81 BP 154/74 R 18 O2 sat
94% on 2L. Patient was given duonebs X 3, dilaudid 1mg IV X 1.
A CXR showed severe emphysema without acute process.  She was
evaluated by orthopedics who put her R leg in a knee
immobilizer.
.
Upon arrival to ICU, the patient was in moderate respiratory
distress and using accessory muscles to breath.  O2 sats
initially 80% on 2L while transporting her to the bed and with
talking.  O2 sats improved over next 30 minutes to 88-90% on 3L
after not talking.


Past Medical History:
-MS, relapsing and remitting, pt states no current symptoms
-Hypertension
-COPD on 3L home O2
-Anorexia of unclear etiology
-Cardiomyopathy in [**2161**] (unclear etiology, EF recovered on echo
[**2162**])

Imaging:
Femur XRAY ([**10-14**])
R femur fracture: Right femur fracture.

Proximally, a fixation plate and screw complex is noted
supporting the hip
and distally there is a minimally displaced oblique vertical
fracture at the lateral aspect of the distal metaphysis of the
femur. The distal fragment overall shows good apposition with
the proximal fragment and the distal fragment shows slight
deviation anterolaterally from its donor site. There is no
additional fracture site more proximally.

Echo ([**10-16**])
The left atrium is normal in size. There is probably mild left
ventricular hypertrophy (views are suboptimal). The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). The right ventricular
free wall is hypertrophied. The right ventricular cavity is
dilated with probably normal free wall contractility. The aortic
root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. The aortic valve
leaflets are mildly thickened (probably trileaflet). There is no
aortic valve stenosis. The mitral valve appears structurally
normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. The tricuspid valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is at least moderate to
severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.


Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 55 yo F w/hx of severe COPD who presents with R femur
fracture and difficulty breathing.
.
#. Respiratory Status: On admission, patient was comfortable on
3L NC which is home rate. Differential included COPD
exacerbation vs. worsening of respiratory status secondary to
pain and femur fracture. She does not signs of PNA or infection
on CXR and no other symptoms of fever or cough. Respiratory
status is most likely baseline. Unclear why she has such severe
lung disease given relatively [**Name2 (NI) 15403**] smoking history, but she
was only taking an albuterol inhaler at home. On [**10-14**], patient
developed increased work of breathing. ABG had increased PaCO2
to 100s, put on BiPAP, repeat ABG showed same PaCO2 100s, and pt
intubated. She was maintained on albuterol nebs, ipratropium
nebs, and budesonide nebs.  After intubation pressures dropped
to 60/40's, started on pressors, which were soon after weaned.
Extubation was attempted on [**2164-10-20**], but patient failed and was
reintubated less than an hour later [**3-19**] hypoxia/increased work
of breathing.  She became hypotensive again after reintubation
and was again started on 3 pressors, which were eventually
weaned. She was also started on steroids at that time (IV
methylpred eventually switched to PO prednisone-will require 2
wk taper). It was decided that she could not tolerate extubation
[**3-19**] poor respiratory reserve and she was taken for trach/PEG on
[**2164-10-25**].  It should also be noted that she completed a seven day
course for presumed ventilator associated pneumonia with
vanco/cefepime/ciprofloxacin.

.
#. Femur Fracture: Likely secondary to osteoporosis and possibly
from prior steroid use. Unclear why she is not on calcium and
vit D and/or bisphosphonate.  She was started on these inhouse.
She was taken to the OR on [**2164-10-16**] for ORIF of right distal
femur. She was started on prophylactic lovenox 30mg [**Hospital1 **] on
POD#1. She will need her staples removed on [**10-30**] (2 weeks post
op).
.
#. Cardiac: On admission, ectopy on ECG-Likely secondary to low
electrolytes. Electrolytes were aggressively repleted. Concerned
that labile bp's could be [**3-19**] ischemia, got ekg which looked
same as priors (inflat q waves) and trop which were neg.   Got
OSH records which showed that pt had recent NSTEMI in [**7-24**]
and also has cardiomyopathy c EF of 20%. Repeat Echo showed
EF>55%, mild LVH, normal LVEF, dilated RV, with moderate to
severe PA systolic HTN.
.
#. Anemia: Likely [**3-19**] iron deficiency. Hct at OSH was 37 in [**Month (only) **]
[**2164**]. Hct inhouse ranged 24-28. Vitamin B12 and folate were
