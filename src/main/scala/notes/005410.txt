Brief Hospital Course:
Pt was admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**]. On admission, pt was intubated and
placed on AC ventilation. ABGs were drawn which showed a
respiritory acidosis which improved with decreased respiratory
rate. On first night of admission, her oxygen requirment was
weaned to FIO2 of 40%.

Pt had oliguric renal failure likely related to her arrest. Pts
urine outpt remained less than 20 cc/hr durign her stay.

Neuro exam on admission showed only spontaneous respirations as
the only brainstem function in tact. The next day her exam
remained unchanged. Neurology was consulted and stated the
prognosis was poor and pt would not lilely recover any brain
function.

Pt s daughter and granddaughter were at bedside on admission.
They were informed on the grim progrnosis. Pts HCP [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) 449**]
arrived following day. On ICU day 3, a family mtg was held to
determine the plan of care and it was decided to extubate the pt
and make her comfortable. Pts PCP Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 3694**] from [**Hospital1 112**] was
informed and was on hand for the family mtg. Pt passed away on
[**2179-11-18**] at 1 50 pm. There was no repsonse to name, noxious
stimuli, no herat sounds or respiration for 1 minute, and no
corneal reflex. The family declined an autopsy. Paper work was
completed and sent to admitting.
