Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 443**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest discomfort, shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
84-year-old female with CAD s/p CABG in [**9-18**] (LIMA-LAD,
SVG-OM1), CHF, ESRD on HD, DMII, PAF who is transferred from
outside hospital for cardiac catheterization.
.
The patient recently presented to [**Hospital3 **] with a CHF
exacerbation and developed worsening renal failure requiring
initiation of hemodialysis. She was discharged to rehab and
developed chest discomfort, epigastric discomfort and
progressive shortness of breath. She represented to [**Hospital1 **] where she admitted to the ICU. She had evidence of
moderate CHF on CXR and was also in atrial fibrillation. She was
started on a diltiazem drip which was discontinued with
metoprolol tartrate PO for rate control. Her oxygen saturation
was 94-97% on 5 liters of O2. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4469**] was worried that the
CHF could be related to ongoing ischemia and transferred the
patient to [**Hospital1 18**] for cardiac catheterization.
.
Vital signs on transfer were afebrile, BP 149/46, HR 65 SR, RR
21, SaO2 94-97% on 5 liters.
.
On review of systems, she denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. She denies recent fevers, chills or
rigors. She denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the
other review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for current absence of
chest pain. Reports dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal
dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema.

Pertinent Results:
Transthoracic Echo [**2190-3-27**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal
cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
Doppler parameters are most consistent with Grade II (moderate)
left ventricular diastolic dysfunction. Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
present. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is mild
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
normal global and regional biventricular systolic function.
Moderate diastolic LV dysfunction. Mild mitral regurgitation.
Mild pulmonary hypertension.

CXR [**2190-3-26**]: There are median sternotomy wires. Right-sided
dual-lumen central venous catheter with distal tip at the
cavoatrial junction. Cardiac silhouette is within normal limits.
There is increased opacity at the right lung base with
obscuration of the right hemidiaphragm and costophrenic angle,
most likely in keeping with a moderate-sized pleural effusion.
There is blunting of the left costophrenic angle, in keeping
with a mild subpleural effusion. There are increased linear
opacities, vascular distention and parahilar opacities in
keeping with moderate CHF. No evidence of pneumothorax.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is an 84 year old woman with past medical history of
DM, HTN, CKD, hyperlipidemia and CAD s/p CABG x2
LIMA->LAD,SVG->OM1 who initially presented to an outside
hospital with chest discomfort and shortness of breath.  She was
transferred here for possible cardiac catherization as her
symptoms were thought to be ischemic in nature.

#.Acute on Chronic Diastolic Congestive Heart Failure:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to the hospital with an acute
exacerbation of her congestive heart failure. She was noted to
have diffuse crackles in both lungs and 1+ pitting lower
extremity edema on admission.  A transthroacic echo was done on
[**2190-3-27**] which revealed Diastolic dysfunction with EF of >55%.
She underwent multiple hemodialysis treatments with removal of
fluid and subsequent improvement of her symptoms.

# Coronary Artery Disease:
Patient is s/p CABG x 2 - SVG-OM and LIMA-LAD.  Her chest
discomfort was thought to be anginal in nature, however it was
believed that this was likely due to her atrial fibrillation and
RVR and more related to demand ischemia rather than acute plaque
rupture.  The decision was made to medically manage her coronary
artery disease, and she was discharged on metoprolol for rate
control, hydralazine for afterload reduction and isosorbide
mononitrate for anginal symptom control.

# ESRD currently on Hemodialysis
She was started on Hemodialysis at [**Hospital3 **] and was
transferred with a right sided tunneled IJ Quinton catheter in
place.  She was followed by the Nephrology team and received
regular Hemodialysis during hospitalization.  There is still
potential for recovery of her renal function in the future,
though she will need dialysis for the near future.  She has had
a Chest Xray and a PPD was placed on [**2190-3-30**] in preparation for
outpatient hemodialysis.  She will need an outpatient
nephrologist.  PPD will need to be read on [**4-1**] or [**4-2**].

# Paroxsymal atrial fibrillation:
The patient initially presented in atrial fibrillation with RVR
at an outside hospital, where she was placed on diltiazem drip.
On transfer she was still in atrial fibrillation and rate
controlled with metoprolol, also on amiodarone for rhythm
control.  She converted to normal sinus rhythm during
hospitalization.  She was also started on w
