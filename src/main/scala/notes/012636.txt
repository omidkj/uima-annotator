Allergies:
Ergotamine / Hydralazine / Paxil

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3561**]
Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea and fatigue

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
BiPAP

History of Present Illness:
85 year old female with chief complaint of tachypnea and
coughing-up blood. Pt has had a cough for about 1 week and had
been more fatigued. She has also been having constipation for
several days and last night while having a BM began coughing.
With this had tachypnea and coughing up bright red blood last
night (about a tsp mixed with mucus) and then flet better. She
was going to her PCP this AM and had another episode of
hemoptysis in the car. At her PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] was hypoxic to 85 on RA,
with a baseline of 96% with no oxygen at home.  She was
tachypneic to 40s. She was sent to the ER.
.
In the ED, initial vs were: T -98.2. HR- 68, BP- 164/54, O2- 93
on RA. Patient was given ASA 325mg, Vanco 1g, and Ceftriaxone 1
g IV.
She had one episode of about a tsp of hemoptysis mixed with
mucus. She was placed on a non-rebreather and was sating 100%.
She was changed to a nasal canula. She was at MS A&O x 1. She
had an EKG that showed LVH, new V4-V6 ST depressions which cards
thought was strain. She had a negative UA. CXR showed a new left
effusion compared to [**2108**]. No nebs were given. Again became
tachypneic with HTN 180s. EKG showed larger ST depressions in
lateral leads and STE in V1-V2. Cards thought this was still
related to strain. CTA was done that showed no PE, but did show
PNA in LLL and left effusion. She was started on BIPAP and
transferred to the ICU. VS at transfer: HR 63 BP 133/46 RR 19 O2
100 BIPAP 15/5 FIO2 60%. Pt is DNR/DNI.

some degree of resolution since prior, less STE in V1 and V2


Brief Hospital Course:
MICU COURSE:
85 yo f with hx of COPD, Dementia, HTN, admitted from ER with
dyspnea and hemoptysis in setting of new PNA and with EKG
changes.

1. Dyspnea: Long history of COPD and now with worsening cough,
shortness of breath, and hemoptysis.  CXR with new left pleural
effusion and CTA with LLL consolidation, likely representing
pneumonia.  CTA negative for PE. The patient was originally
admitted to the MICU for tachypnea requiring bipap.  In the
MICU, bipap was weaned and she was on 4 L NC.  Pneumonia treated
with ceftriaxone and azithromycin.  She was started on RTC
ipratropium and albuterol nebs.  Given her hemoptysis, dyspnea,
unilateral pleural effusion, and signficiant smoking history,
there is some concern for lung cancer. The patient's HCP was
told of this concern, but would like to defer this work up.  The
patient maintained oxygenation with NC and was felt ready to be
transferred to the floor on [**9-18**]. Goal O2 sat > 92%

2. EKG changes: Compared to a prior EKG from >5 years ago, the
patient was noted to have new ST depressions and elevations
concerning for ACS.  She has a background of moderate aortic
stenosis and mild MR.  She was noted to have dynamic changes in
the ED when she became tachypneic and was hypertensives with
changes in the lateral and precordial leads.  Cardiology was
consulted and thought that these EKG changes were due to cardiac
strain.  Pt was given 325 mg ASA, continued on her home statin,
[**Last Name (un) **] and CCB.  Telemetry was monitored. EKGs were cycled. CEs
were also cycled and troponin was felt to be elevated due to
renal failure. CK and MBs remained flat.  Echo was obtained
while in the ICU.

3. Hypertension: BP was elevated in ER during tachypnea.
Continued home amlodipine.  Home [**Last Name (un) **] was changed to Valsartan.

4. Dementia: pt has chronic dementia, per family she is at
baseline A&O x 1. Continued Aricept.

5. Chronic renal failure: Cr is at baseline 1.8. [**Month (only) 116**] worsen in
setting of having a CTA. Monitor renal function.

6. Anemia: stable, chronic

7. Lung Nodules: Seen on chest CTA, long hx of smoking
concerning for cancer risk. Will need out pt follow up

8. Osteoporosis: chronic. Continue Ca and Vitamin D.  Fosamax
weekly on Sundays

# FEN: replete electrolytes, will start diet once off BIPAP
# Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin
# Access: peripherals
# Code: DNR/DNI, confirmed
# Communication: HCP is her daughter, copy of paperwork in chart

=====
The patient was then transferred to the floor.  On the floor,
she was noted to be tachypneic, hypoxic, and tachycardic.  ABG
was completed. EKG with new ST elevations.  She was transferred
back to the MICU.  In the MICU, she was maintained on
non-rebreather.  Cardiology was consulted for STEMI.   Patient
was accepted onto CCU service.  She was then noted to go into
rapid AFib. Metoprolol IV x 1 and dilt IV x 1 were given.  She
converted to NSR.  However, before transfer could occur to CCU,
the patient was noted to become hypotensive and began to become
bradycardic. She PEA arrested, and because she was DNR/DNI, no
resuscitative measures were completed.  Family was at bedside at
the time of death at 6:45 PM on [**2110-9-18**].
