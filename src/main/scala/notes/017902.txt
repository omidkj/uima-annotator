History of Present Illness:
Mr [**Known lastname **] was transferred from [**Hospital3 25148**] Center on [**12-20**]
for an intracranial bleed. Mr [**Known lastname **] is a 79-year-old right
handed man with
atrial fibrillation previously on coumadin (and ASA). According
to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 81916**] note (because the patient is currently
intubated and ventilated), he had a history of multiple falls,
and

hip
and leg pain. There was no reported head trauma. On [**12-20**] he was
found to be confused, speaking nonsensical words, and his brain
imaging showed a hemorrhage in the left lateral ventricle. His
INR was 1.9, and he received vitamin K, and 1U of FFP.
He was then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**], where he was admitted to
Neurosurgery.

Brief Hospital Course:
TRANSFERRED TO Neurology ICU team: [**12-24**]
1. EEG 11/ 30 to 12/ 02: negative for seizures. Dc'd PHT. He was
on ETOH withdrawal.
2. AF:
*Off AC, but started ASA 81 qd on 12/ 01.
*Rate control was difficult: on metoprolol, diltiazem, and
digoxin,
3. HTN: difficult to control: on clonidine, labetalol, HCTZ,
amlodipine,  plus the above mentioned agents. Required a NTG
drip for 2 hours on 12/ 09/ 08
4. ID:
UTI (U cx EColi pansensitive) was treated and resolved. in
addition,  he had an  aspiration PNA (RUL)treated for 7 days.
Sputum cx: GRAM POSITIVE COCCI IN PAIRS AND CLUSTERS. Started on
Nafxillin 2 g q6h on 12/ 03 (evening), stopped vancomycin and
Zosyn on 12/ 04).
5. Extubated (12/ 04)
6. DVT  ppx: on hep sc 5000 tid started on 12/ 01.
7. Contact[**Name (NI) **] family: health care proxy confirmed he is Full code

This 79 yo man was admitted with bilateral intraventricular
hemorrhage to the ICU intubated. His ICU course was complicated
by PNA and UTI that were treated with full courses of
antibiotics. His ICU course was also complicated by persistent
HTN and tachycardia. Cardiology was consulted and his rate and
BP were controlled with a panoply of pharmacological agents,
which were eventually titrated to an oral regimen that could be
administered on the general floor. Efforts to elucidate
secondary causes of HTN were unrevealing. Once transferred to
the general floor, he remained afebrile and his BP and HR
remained well controlled. His lipid panel was elevated and so
his dose of home pravastatin was increased. Per discussion with
both his family and PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] history of multiple falls recently
precludes him from re-starting his coumadin despite his AF. His
neurological exam on discharge was notable for ongoing
disorientation, mild right NLF flattening, moving all ext
antigravity, though probably with some weakness R > L, upgoing
toes bilaterally, and able to transfer from bed to chair with
max assist, but unable to functionally ambulate.
