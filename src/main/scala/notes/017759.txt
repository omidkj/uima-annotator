CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Abdominal aortic aneurysm.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient was referred to Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 1391**] for evaluation of abdominal aortic aneurysm. She now
is admitted for elective open abdominal aortic repair with
ventral herniorrhaphy. Initial findings of the aneurysm was
on a x-ray for workup for a UTI.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Includes rheumatoid arthritis,
prednisone dependent and on methotrexate; ischemic heart
disease with a myocardial infarction in [**2155**], stress test
done on [**2159-11-18**] was without ischemic changes, no
perfusion deficits, ejection fraction was 72% with no wall
motion abnormalities; also history of GERD; history of
urinary tract infections, treated; history of skin cancer;
history of MRSA infections; history of UTI sepsis with
hypotension.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Includes coronary artery angioplasty
with stenting to the right coronary artery, proximal mid RCA
and distal RCA in [**2156-3-29**]; knee replacements; closed
reduction of a olecranon process fracture; open
reduction/internal fixation in [**2157**]; hernia repair; a gastric
repair; a pelvic fracture in [**2158-8-30**]; hysterectomy.

ALLERGIES:  A history of multiple drug allergies; which
include DEMEROL causing nausea and vomiting; LOPRESSOR
causing hypotension; PENICILLIN manifestation no documented;
all "[**Last Name (un) **] DRUGS like i.e., NOVOCAINE/LIDOCAINE."

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Aspirin 81 mg daily, atenolol 50
mg daily, Atrovent puffer 2 daily, Colace 100 mg daily, folic
acid 1 mg daily, Lipitor 20 mg daily, lorazepam 0.5 mg [**12-31**]
tablet daily, prednisone 5 mg in the morning and 2 mg in the
evening, Protonix 40 mg daily. Other medications include
Actonel 35 mg daily, methotrexate 2.5 mg 6 tablets q. Friday,
multivitamins, vitamin D and oyster calcium.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  VITAL SIGNS: Blood pressure was
174/84, heart rate was 88, O2 saturation 96% on room air. The
patient is 58 inches in height and is 161 pounds (or 73.818
kilograms). GENERAL APPEARANCE: A white female in no acute
distress. Pupils are equal, round and reactive to light and
accommodation. There are no tremors. HEART: A regular rate
and rhythm. Normal S1 and S2 without any extra heart sounds.
There are no carotid bruits. LUNGS: With rales/crackles at
the bases bilaterally. ABDOMEN: Protuberant, soft, nontender;
without bruits. Abdominal aortic prominence could not be
felt. EXTREMITIES: Show some pedal edema with dopplerable
pedal pulses bilaterally.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the
preoperative holding area on [**2160-2-18**]. She underwent
abdominal aortic repair on a infrarenal aortic aneurysm with
a tube graft and a ventral hernia repair secondary to
compartment separation. The patient tolerated the procedure
well and was transferred to the PACU intubated in stable
condition. She did have some episodes of hypotension
requiring fluid boluses. The patient failed to be extubated
and was transferred to the surgical intensive care for
ventilatory support. The patient required aggressive diuresis
for volume overload and transfusion for blood loss anemia.
The patient remained in the ICU. The patient was extubated on
postoperative day #5. She continued to do well. Her blood gas
was 7.37/46/86/28/0. WBC was 10.6, hematocrit 28.2, BUN 23,
creatinine 0.8. The patient continued to remain with JP
drains in place. She was transferred to the VICU for
continued monitoring and care. She was transfused 1 unit of
packed red blood cells for her hematocrit of 23.9 and
diuresed. She did have some episodes of SVT which responded
to beta blockade. The patient's NG was removed, and sips of
clear liquids were begun on [**2160-2-26**]. The patient
tolerated these. She did have active bowel sounds, but denied
passing flatus. She did require continued diuresis for her
postoperative volume overload. The patient was evaluated by
physical therapy, and felt that she was a good candidate for
rehab at the time of discharge prior to being discharged to
home. Ambulation was begun on [**2160-2-26**] to a chair;
and on [**2160-2-27**] ambulation in the [**Doctor Last Name **] was begun. JP
drainage was monitored and if less than 100 cc for 24 hours
would consider discontinuing the JP's.

DISCHARGE DISPOSITION:  The patient will be transferred to
rehab when medically ready.
