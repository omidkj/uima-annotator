REASON FOR ADMISSION:  Admission for hypertrophic obstructive
cardiomyopathy alcohol septal ablation.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a pleasant 74-year-old
female with a history of hypertrophic obstructive
cardiomyopathy with a left ventricular outflow tract gradient
of 60, congestive heart failure, severe mitral regurgitation,
paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, and diabetes, who has been
admitted multiple times ([**2127-6-17**], [**2127-7-9**], [**2127-7-11**]) with a
CHF exacerbation.  She now complains of increasing symptoms
of congestive heart failure (orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal
dyspnea at rest and with exertion, peripheral edema) over the
past five days.  She denies dietary indiscretion.  During her
last admission, her Zaroxolyn was discontinued.

She has had some edema of her lower extremities bilaterally
for the past few weeks.  Of note, she was started on
ciprofloxacin p.o. b.i.d., now on day five of 10 for left
upper extremity cellulitis.  She has not taken Coumadin since
[**2127-7-21**].

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Ten systems were reviewed and were
negative as above.  The patient denies cough, fever, chest
discomfort, palpitations, or lightheadedness.

PHYSICAL EXAM AT TIME OF ADMISSION:  Blood pressure was
134/41, heart rate was 68 and regular, respiratory rate is
14, temperature of 98.1, oxygenation of 93% on room air.
General:  Pleasant female sitting up in no apparent distress
alert and oriented times three.  HEENT:  Pupils are equal,
round, and reactive to light and accommodation.  Extraocular
movements are intact.  Moist mucous membranes.  Oropharynx
benign.  Anicteric sclerae.  No jugular venous distention was
noted.  Lungs:  Minimal crackles [**11-23**] of the way up
bilaterally.  Cardiovascular:  Nondisplaced point of maximal
impulse, regular, rate, and rhythm with a normal S1 greater
than S2, [**1-23**] blowing systolic ejection murmur at the apex and
[**1-23**] holosystolic murmur at the base that increased with
Valsalva maneuvers.  Abdomen is soft, nontender, nondistended
with positive bowel sounds, no hepatosplenomegaly or bruits.
Extremities:  1+ pitting edema to the ankles bilaterally.
Skin:  Consistent with mild sunburn over the upper chest, no
bruises or rashes.

STUDIES:  Laboratories:  White blood cell count 11.6, 80.2%
neutrophils, 14.3% lymphocytes, 4.3% monocytes, 0.8%
eosinophils, hematocrit 36.9.  INR was 4.8, glucose 66, BUN
55, creatinine 1.4.  Sodium 134, potassium 2.9, chloride 90,
bicarb 31.

CONCISE SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted
to the [**Hospital Unit Name 196**] Service, placed on telemetry.  Cardiac enzymes
were cycled.  Patient was placed on standard CHF protocol
with a low sodium fluid-restricted diet.  Head of the bed
elevated at 45 degrees.  Lower extremities elevated while
patient in bed.

1. Coronaries.  In preparation for the HOCM septal ablation,
the coronary arteries were imaged with cardiac
catheterization and were found to have no significant
lesions.  The patient's cardiac enzymes were stable prior her
septal ablation.

CHF:  The patient had daily weights and ins and outs
monitored.  She was continued on Toprol XL, Lasix,
spironolactone, Zaroxolyn.  Serial chest x-rays at three
different points throughout her hospital course demonstrated
no evidence of congestive heart failure.  The patient's lower
extremity edema improved after gentle diuresis.

Electrophysiology:  The patient remained in an A-V paced
rhythm.  Her Coumadin continued to be held secondary to
supertherapeutic levels.  The patient was maintained on
amiodarone, Toprol XL, and a calcium-channel blocker.
Telemetry was monitored on a daily basis without any
abnormalities.

Diabetes mellitus:  The patient was placed on Glipizide XL 5
mg p.o. q.d. and placed on an insulin-sliding scale.  Her
glucose control remained adequate throughout her hospital
stay.

2. Upper extremity cellulitis:  The patient was continued on
ciprofloxacin 500 mg p.o. b.i.d.

3. Hypokalemia:  The patient was profoundly hypokalemic and
was as low as 2.5 mEq/L at various points in her hospital
stay despite aggressive p.o. potassium repletion.  The
patient refused to take intravenous potassium chloride,
although on [**2127-7-25**], on the date of her septal ablation, she
did allow potassium chloride to be repleted through a
concentration of 40 mEq of potassium in a 500 cc 1/2 normal
saline bag at 50 cc/hour.

4. Electrolytes:  The patient's renal function was monitored
throughout her hospital course, and remained stable.

5. Hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy:  The patient
underwent an alcohol septal ablation on [**2127-7-25**] without
complication with minimal right groin bleeding postprocedure
that quickly resolved.

Summary of alcohol septal ablation:
1. Coronary angiography of the right side dominant system
revealed no significant obstructive disease.  The left main,
left anterior descending artery, left circumflex, right
coronary arteries, and mild luminal irregularities without
significant obstructive disease.
2. Resting hemodynamic measurements at baseline revealed a
left ventricular outflow gradient at 45 mm Hg.  Right and
left sided filling pressures were severely elevated with a
right ventricular end diastolic pressure of 50 mm Hg.  Left
ventricular end diastolic pressure of 20 mm Hg.  Pulmonary
artery pressures were moderately elevated to 55/25.  Cardiac
index was mildly reduced at 2.3 liters/minute/meters squared
calculated by the Fick equation using assumed oxygen
consumption.  On pullback across the aortic valve, the
gradient was confirmed to be isolated to the left ventricular
outflow tract with no appreciate gradient across the aortic
valve.  On dobutamine at 5 mcg/kg/min IV drip, hemodynamic
measurements revealed worsening of the left ventricular
outflow gradient to 100 mm Hg.
3. Septal ablation was successfully performed by injection of
ethanol into three septal perforators under fluoroscope and
echocardiographic guidance.
4. Post-procedure hemodynamic measurements revealed
resolution of the left ventricular outflow gradient.  Final
hemodynamic measurements reveal a residual outflow gradient
of less than 10 mm Hg.  An echocardiogram was performed on
[**2127-7-28**].  The results are still pending at the time of
dictation.  By verbal report, the cardiac catheterization
findings were confirmed.

The patient's prior medications used to control her CHF and
cardiomyopathy were gradually weaned beginning with the
Lasix, which was weaned on [**2127-7-26**], and the verapamil which
was weaned on [**2127-7-28**].

6. Hematological:  The patient's Coumadin was restarted on
[**2127-7-26**] with a target INR of 2.0 to 3.0.  On the day of
discharge, the patient's
