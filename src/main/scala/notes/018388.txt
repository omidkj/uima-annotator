cycle 2 Day 17 capecitabine/oxaliplatin admitted with altered

Per brother who lives with patient, she woke up this am around 9
and initially seemed normal but he realized within approxiamtely
one hour around 9am that she was having balance and gait
difficulty as well as difficulty speaking coherently and in
complete sentences. She was also repeating phrases. He did not
note slurred speech. This episode was similar to although less
severe than prior episode in [**Month (only) **] attributed to narcotics.
Since last admitted [**Date range (1) 68940**], he has been monitoring her
narcotic use and she has only take dilaudid 2mg PO x 2 and
morphine 15mg PO x 1 last 24 hours. She also took compazine,
zofran, and meclizine. He does not think she took any other
narcotics or had any other ingestions. She has had no new
medications other than recently being restarted on lasix.

Otherwise, he states she developed dry cough today and has had
rash/sores on lower extremitites since right after she started
2nd cycle of chemo but denies fever, chills, any recent change
in lower extremity edema.

In the ED, initial vs were: 98.2 118 183/76 18 97%RA. Exam was
significant for confusion, asterixis, and erythema bilateral R>L
LEs concerning for cellulitis. CT head was unremarkable and CXR
revealed small to mdoerate right pleural effusion. She received
Vancomycin, Azithromycin and Ceftriaxone for pulmonary vs
skin/soft tissue infection, lactulose for asterixis and elevated
ammonia and potassium for hypokalemia K 3.1. She was reportedly
persistently tachycardic sinus with HR 130s despite 1.5L IVF.
There was concern she would trigger on the floor so she was
admitted to MICU.  VS prior to transfer: 98.2 157/55 121 30
98%RA.

On the floor, she states "I'm fine, thank you" repeatedly or
"I'm ok". She perseverates on words and repeats phrases. Her ROS
is completely negative.
