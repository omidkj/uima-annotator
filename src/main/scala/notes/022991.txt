HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:   The patient is a 74 year old
male with known aortic stenosis who came in to the Cardiac
Catheterization Laboratory for evaluation.  He had eight to
nine years of intermittent chest pain and ruled out for
myocardial infarction in [**2153**].  He has had symptoms of
shortness of breath and palpitations and diagnosed with
atrial fibrillation.  He had been cardioverted in the past
and was managed on Coumadin.  He was found to have aortic
stenosis at that time which was watched carefully.  His
ejection fraction was normal, however, his PA pressures were
elevated and he was found to have severe tricuspid
regurgitation as well.

He denied any claudications or shortness of breath symptoms
at time of presentation, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea or
lightheadedness.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Aortic stenosis.
2.  Atrial fibrillation.
3.  B12 deficient anemia.
4.  Hypothyroidism.
5.  Lower gastrointestinal bleed while on Coumadin requiring
six units, which spontaneously resolved.
6.  Hypertension.
7.  Osteoarthritis.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:
1.  Incarcerated hernia.
2.  Partial colectomy for a small bowel obstruction.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:   On physical the patient is afebrile
and vital signs are stable.  He had a regular rate and rhythm
with a IV/VI systolic ejection murmur in the right upper
sternal border radiating into the carotids.  His lungs were
clear to auscultation bilaterally.  His abdomen was soft,
nontender, nondistended, bowel sounds present.  His
extremities are warm and well perfused with trace edema.

HOSPITAL COURSE:   The patient was taken to the Cardiac
Catheterization Laboratory where the aortic stenosis was
evaluated.  He was found to have clear coronaries at that
time and CT Surgery was consulted.

At the time of consultation, his white blood cell count was
4.5, hematocrit of 32.3, platelet count of 229.  His PT was
13.5, PTT of 26.4, INR of 1.3.  Sodium 145, potassium 4.8,
chloride 111, bicarbonate of 26, BUN of 20 and creatinine of
1.0.  He had a blood sugar of 93.

A Dental consultation was taken at that time and he had teeth
removal on the 18th and due to that, the operation was
cancelled.  However, he was rescheduled for the operation and
was taken to the Operating Room on [**2156-10-22**], where an AVR
pericardial valve was done.  The patient was transferred to
the CSRU postoperatively.

He did well and was able to be weaned and extubated and he
continued to improve.  On [**10-23**], he was transferred to the
Floor.  He did well on the Floor and Physical Therapy was
consulted to assess his ambulation.  He did well with
Physical Therapy, however, due to his age and lack of
endurance, it was felt that he would do best with
rehabilitation placement.

On postoperative day number two, his chest tubes were
removed, his wires were removed and his Foley was removed.
The patient continued to improve on the Floor and is
currently awaiting rehabilitation placement.
