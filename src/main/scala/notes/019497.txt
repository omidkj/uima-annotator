Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 99**]
Chief Complaint:
respiratory distress

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation and Mechanical Ventilation
Continuous venovenous hemodialysis

History of Present Illness:
45 y/o F with hx of HIV and hepatitis C cirrhosis s/p TIPS,
ascites, SBP and encephalopathy who is transferred from the
[**Doctor Last Name 3271**] [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 679**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 4869**] to the MICU for respiratory distress.  The
patient was transferred from an OSH last night for hepato-renal
syndrome and SBP.  She did well overnight except for transient
hypotension that responded to albumin infusion.  She was
continued on cipro for SBP treatment and started on vanco for
broader coverage.  This morning she was on 2L NC and had minimal
urine output.  She was transferred to radiology for CXR and
ultrasound and after transport and lying flat, became tachypneic
and desatted requiring a NRB.  She had an ABG on the floor of
7.20/40/79 and was in obvious distress.  She was given one SLNG
for BP in 160s/110s and started on her diuretics.  Her
respiratory status did not improve.
.
On the floor, she was placed on bipap and tolerated better
except for discomfort from the mask.  She put out minimal urine
to the diuretics.  She was unable to lie flat.  She continues to
complain of shortness of breath.  She denies chest pain, nausea,
vomiting, diarrhea.  She is alert and arousable, but cannot
communicate due to the discomfort from the mask.

Abdominal Ultrasound [**2200-4-4**]
IMPRESSION:
1. Patent TIPS shunt. Full assessment with velocities could not
be obtained
due to the patient's breathing difficulties. The left portal
vein is patent
with hepatopetal flow, with a large a patent umbilical vein.
2. No hydronephrosis; however, imaging of the kidneys is very
limited.
3. Small bilateral pleural effusion. No ascites identified.
.
ECHO [**2200-4-7**]
IMPRESSION: Mildly thickened trileaflet aortic valve with
minimal aortic stenosis. Mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with preserved global and regional biventricular
systolic function. Moderate tricuspid regurgitation. Mild
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. Dilated ascending
aortal.
.
ECHO [**2200-4-25**]:
The left atrium is elongated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is mildly
dilated. Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
The estimated cardiac index is high (>4.0L/min/m2). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There
is mild aortic valve stenosis (valve area 1.2-1.9cm2). The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral
valve prolapse. Mild to moderate ([**1-25**]+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is
mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
normal global and regional biventricular systolic function. Mild
aortic stenosis. Mild to moderate mitral regurgitation. Moderate
tricuspid regurgitation. Mild pulmonary hypertension
.
EEG:
IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal video EEG study due to slowing
and
suppression of the background with GPEDs at approximately 1 Hz.
These
findings are suggestive of severe cortical and subcortical
dysfunction
and may be seen associated with non-convulsive status
epilepticus;
however, there was no evidence of non-convulsive status
epilepticus in
this study.
.
CT HEAD:
There is no evidence of hemorrhage, edema, masses, midline shift
or
infarction. The ventricles and sulci are normal in size and
caliber. The
[**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter differentiation is preserved. The previously
described
inspissated mucus in the right maxillary sinus is not seen on
the current
study. The paranasal sinuses are clear and well aerated. The
mastoid air
cells are clear bilaterally. No fractures or soft tissue
abnormalities are
detected. IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial process.
.
Abomdinal U/S:
1. Patent TIPS shunt with velocities in a reasonable range.
Three-month
followup is suggested. Flow in the left and right portal veins
is away from
the TIPS shunt. Patent umbilical vein is again noted.
2. Scant trace of ascites, insufficient for marking for
paracentesis.
3. Mild splenomegaly.
4. Gallbladder sludge. No biliary dilatation and no focal liver
lesion.


Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 45 year old female with Hep C cirrhosis, HIV on HAART,
admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2200-4-3**] with respiratory distress
due to volume overload requiring intubation and oliguric acute
renal failure likely due to hypotension and hepatorenal
syndrome.  She had a prolonged hospital course complicated by
seizures likely secondary to her hepatic failure and uremia,
progressive deterioration in her liver and renal function,
coagulopathy, respiratory failure requiring intubation, and
hypotension requiring multiple vasopressor support. Multiple
services were involved in her
