History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 29179**] is a 55 year-old man with HCV cirrhosis, ESRD, DM,
CAD s/p perioperative MI and PVD who was originally admitted for
upper extremity gangrene [**2111-1-7**] to vascular surgery service
and underwent left brachial to radial bypass on [**2111-1-12**]. The
procedure was complicated by perioperative MI and cardiac
arrest.
.
He was transferred to medicine on [**2111-1-21**] for ascites and
bradycardia. In the two days prior to admission to the MICU, he
was noted to have increased oxygen requirement (95% on 5L from
2L previously) and SBPs dropping from the 100s -> 80s. He
underwent a diagnostic paracentesis on the day of transfer after
receiving albumin 50g (initially planned for therapeutic tap
given increased abdominal distention); the tap was consistent
with SBP and he was started on ceftriaxone.
.
Of note, he has developed new ascites after having been told
that he "cleared" his Hep C years ago after tx with
ribaviron/interferon in [**2101**] at [**Hospital1 112**]. Noted to have a significant
alcohol history as well, but quit drinking approximately 21
years ago. Abdominal distension has been progressive over the
last month. Had tap on [**1-13**] negative for SBP; cytology not
sent. RUQ US on [**2111-1-20**] showed evidence of cirrhosis and
hypoechoic lesion concerning for HCC.
.
Then on [**1-24**] he was transfered to MICU for bradycardia,
hypotension, demand ischemia, and sepsis. He was intubated at
the time of transfer to MICU. In the MICU he was initially on
pressors. CVVH was initiated. He came off pressors on [**2111-1-26**].
He was extubated [**2111-1-27**]. Pressors were restarted on [**1-28**] and
the pt was reintubated on [**2111-1-29**] with worsening mental status.

.
Blood pressure measurement was a constant issue. BPs are
obtained on the right foreman and are approximately 10mmHg below
the a-line.
.
Repeat paracentesis showed SBP, culture negative, and he was
given meropenem, which he remained on for ESBL Klebsiella UTI.
He was also on empiric vancomycin at that time for possible VAP.

.
The patient's respiratory status remains dependent on the level
of abdominal ascites. O2 sats were as low at 33% from the
femoral and improved with paracentesis leading to a dx of
abdominal compartment syndrome. Sats improved with paracentesis.
Abd distension also worsens his respiratory effort and leads to
hypercarbia for which CPAP is used qhs. To prevent worsening of
respiratory status low volume paracentesis has been recommended
q2-4days.
.
He was extubated again on [**2-1**] and off pressors since [**1-31**]. CVVH
was discontinued and the pt tolerated HD [**2-3**]. Multiple goals of
care conversations have been had however the pt remains full
code.

IMAGING
.
[**2111-2-20**] CXR
FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, there is an
unchanged
course of the left-sided double-lumen central venous access line
on the
right-sided PICC line. Unchanged low lung volumes. Unchanged
moderate
cardiomegaly with minimal overhydration and retrocardiac
atelectasis. On
today's image, there is minimal blunting of the left
costophrenic sinus, so that the presence of a minimal left-sided
pleural effusion cannot be excluded. No other changes.
.
CT ABDOMEN WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:
.
There is left lower lobe atelectasis with minimal right-sided
atelectasis. Trace bilateral pleural effusions. There is severe
cardiomegaly and a central venous catheter is partially imaged,
with tip seen within the right atrium.
