Pertinent Results:
[**4-10**] TEE:
LEFT VENTRICLE: Moderately depressed LVEF. No resting LVOT
gradient.
RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.
AORTIC VALVE: Bioprosthetic aortic valve prosthesis (AVR). AVR
well seated, normal leaflet/disc motion and transvalvular
gradients.
MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. Mild
mitral annular calcification. Mild thickening of mitral valve
chordae. Calcified tips of papillary muscles. No MS. Mild (1+)
MR.
TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets. Normal
tricuspid valve supporting structures. No TS. Mild to moderate
[[**11-17**]+] TR. Moderate PA systolic hypertension.

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: Suboptimal image quality - poor echo windows.

Conclusions
Image quality is limited. Overall left ventricular systolic
function appears moderately depressed (LVEF = 35 %) with
regional variation. The interventricular septum appears severely
hypokinetic (the basal anterior septum appears akinetic)
although postoperative septal wall motion abnormality may also
be present. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. A bioprosthetic aortic valve prosthesis is present.
The aortic valve prosthesis appears well seated, with normal
leaflet/disc motion and transvalvular gradients. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

CXR: [**2201-4-10**]:  No pneumothorax status post chest tube removal.
Bibasilar hazy opacities may reflect new minimal pleural
effusions or artifact secondary to semi-erect patient positiong.


[**2201-4-9**]: CT Head:
1.  Minimally increased MTT with decreased cerebral blood flow
and volume
within the left frontal lobe.
2.  No flow-limiting stenosis, aneurysm, or vascular
malformation detected on the CT angiogram.
3.  No acute intracranial hemorrhage detected on the
non-contrast head CT.
4.  Multinodular goiter, including a dominant 2-cm right lobe
lesion,
warranting further evaluation with ultrasound on an outpatient
basis, if prior imaging was not performed.
5.  Moderate emphysema with a linear right upper lobe opacity,
described in detail on the [**2201-2-26**], examination.
6.  Mild pneumomediastinum and overlying anterior subcutaneous
emphysema
within recent-post-mediasternotomy limits.
7. Deg. spine changes with foraminal stenosis.

Brief Hospital Course:
85 yr old female with history of aortic stenosis who was
randomized to surgical arm of corevalve study. She underwent AVR
#21 tissue valve on [**4-8**] the surgery was performed by Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **].
Overall the patient tolerated the procedure well please see
intraop note for further details. She arrived from the OR fully
vented, AV paced  over SB 50's, lower CI on Milrinime and neo.
History of COPD had mild exp wheezing but extubated wihtout
difficulty. Pressors weaned off then hypertensive once extubated
started on Nitro and betablocker. Once extubated patient was
noted to have right sided weakness. Neuro was consulted and stat
head CTA was obtained which showed subltle area of hypoperfusion
in the left frontal lobe. Her neuro status returned to [**Location 213**]
within 24hrs therefore the head MRI was cancelled.  It was felt
her symptoms were suggestive of spasm. Of note she was weak and
deconditioned preoperatively and continued to be so
post-operatively. Her appetite was poor and she needed a great
deal of ecouragement to eat. She remained hemodynamcially stable
tolerated low dose lasix and betablocker. Pacing wires and Ct
were removed in timely fashion. She was evaluated by the
physical therapy service who recommended discharge to rehab. By
the time of discharge on POD 6 the patient was stable, her wound
was healing and her pain was controlled with Ultram. The patient
was discharged to [**Hospital 38**] Rehabilitation in stable condition
with appropriate follow up instructions advised.
