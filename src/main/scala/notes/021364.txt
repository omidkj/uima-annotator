Service:  [**Year (4 digits) 662**]
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname 108131**] is a 59 year-old
man well known to the Medical Service with multiple medical
problems including end stage renal disease, severe chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease and AIDS who presented to the
[**Hospital1 69**] on the [**11-7**]
discharged on both [**10-26**] and [**11-5**].  The [**10-26**] discharge was for hypercarbic respiratory failure,
increasing potassium and this was secondary to missing
dialysis.  The admission from [**11-2**] to [**11-5**] was
for cellulitis.  Mr. [**Known lastname 108131**] was discharged two days prior
to admission and was to get dialysis the day prior to
admission, but refused to go to dialysis, because he had just
developed difficulty breathing last night per his wife.
Usually he uses 4 liters nasal cannula, but his oxygen
saturation was 88% per his wife.  The oxygen was increased to
5 liters on a face mask and his sats responded to 95%.  On
the morning of admission he felt weak, he slipped on two
stairs and fell on his buttocks and sustained a small
abrasion to his hand.  EMS was initially called upon this
fall and helped Mr. [**Known lastname 108131**] from the floor and subsequently
left.  The patient then developed chest pressure during the
course of the morning and felt like food was getting stuck in
his throat.  He subsequently developed mid sternal chest
pressure with associated nausea.  He then presented to the
Emergency Department.  In the Emergency Department he was
found to be hypercarbic, acidotic and hyperkalemic.  BiPAP
was initiated.  The patient did refuse intubation.  He
received insulin, dextrose, calcium gluconate in the
Emergency Department for his hyperkalemia and he was
subsequently transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit
for urgent dialysis.

he has used alcohol in the past.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Temperature 97.9.  Blood
pressure 109/61.  Heart rate 75.  Respirations 18.
Saturation 100% on BiPAP.  In general, the patient is ill,
cachectic appearing, and agitated and swearing at examiners.
HEENT BiPAP was on.  Mucous membranes are moist.  Neck
supple.  Lungs crackles throughout anterior lung fields.
Cardiovascular regular rate and rhythm.  2 out of 6 systolic
murmur heard best at the apex.  Abdomen soft, but refused
rest of the examination.  Extremities 2+ edema, erythema and
ulcers on his toes bilaterally.  Neurological moving all
extremities, agitated.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON DISCHARGE:  Temperature 96.4, blood
pressure 132/96.  Heart rate 82.  Respirations 20.
Saturation 100% on 5 liters.  In general, no acute distress,
alert and oriented.  HEENT pupils are equal, round and
reactive to light.  Extraocular movements intact.  Oropharynx
is clear.  No thrush.  Neck is supple.  Lungs with bilateral
rhonchi, but moving air in all fields.  Heart regular rate
and rhythm, 2 out of 6 systolic ejection murmur best at the
apex.  Abdomen soft, nontender, nondistended, active bowel

LABORATORIES ON ADMISSION:  White blood cell count 2.3, 73%
neutrophils, 2% bands, 15% lymphocytes, 8% monocytes,
hematocrit 36.9, platelets 82, sodium 138, potassium 7.2,
chloride 102, bicarbonate 24, BUN 82, creatinine 8.8, glucose
108, PT 13.6, INR 1.2, PTT 36.1.  Blood gas 7.05/97/84.
Blood gas number two 7.10/85/58.  Chest x-ray showed
worsening right middle lobe opacity.  No overt congestive
heart failure.  Electrocardiogram was normal sinus rhythm at
89 beats per minute, the PR was slightly prolonged at 220
seconds QRS, slightly prolonged 140 milliseconds,
intraventricular conduction delay, no significant changes
except for an increased PR interval.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  1.  Renal:  Upon admission Mr. [**Known lastname 108131**]
again presented with hyperkalemia, fluid overload and severe
acidosis.  His usual pH runs approx. 7.2.  He was
profoundly acidotic compared to this on admission.  He was
admitted to the MICU and received urgent dialysis the night
of admission. He also received dialysis two more times on the
day after admission.  During the rest of his hospital stay he
continued to receive dialysis on a regular basis.  He did not
present of any other symptoms of fluid overload during the
course of his hospital stay and did well with his dialysis
and tolerated it well.  He was maintained on a renal diet.
He received Renagel and Mepro as previously prescribed as
well as sodium bicarbonate.

2.  [**Known lastname **] of breath:  Mr. [**Known lastname 108131**] [**Last Name (Titles) 7186**] of breath
was most likely attributed to the fluid overload, although
there was no overt congestive heart failure on his chest
x-ray.  He did improve significantly after fluid was removed
with dialysis and he was maintained on his normal home
regimen of oxygen at 4 to 6 liters of nasal cannula oxygen.
His saturations remained excellent throughout the rest of his
hospital stay.

3.  Chest pain:  Mr. [**Known lastname 108131**] initially presented with
substernal chest pain.  He had cardiac enzymes sent to
evaluate if he had an injury to his myocardium.  He had
numerous creatine kinases sent, which were all below 100.  MB
fractions were not performed.  Troponin was initially 0.5,
but slowly raised to 1.4, although this is nonspecific and
does not suggest an acute myocardial infarction especially in
the setting of renal failure.  It was not felt that Mr.
[**Known lastname 108131**] had any sort of myocardial ischemia during this
hospital admission, but that enzyme abnormalities were related
to preexisting cardiomyopathy.

4.  Infectious disease:  Mr. [**Known lastname 108131**] presented with a recent
history of cellulitis.  He still had some erythema of both
his lower extremities and there was also concern for a
pneumonia on his x-ray.  He was treated with Vancomycin.  He
was dosed at dialysis for any hemoconcentration less then 15.
He was also maintained on Levaquin 250 mg every other day.
The antibiotics were stopped on [**2179-11-12**].  Subsequent to this
stopping his antibiotics he remained afebrile and his white
count did not increase.  He was discharged without any active
inflammatory or infectious processes.  He was maintained on
Bactrim for PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 1102**].  Mr. [**Known lastname 108131**
