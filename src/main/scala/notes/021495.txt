Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2167**]
Chief Complaint:
SOB

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
82 yo F w/ reported CHF, CAD, and reported COPD/obstructive lung
disease p/w increasing SOB & decreased exercise tolerance x's 2
weeks. At recent checkup ([**2120-7-9**]) was noted to have crackles on
exam and started on lasix 40mg. On follow-up 2 days later, she
noted symptomatic improvement but no increase in UOP, and lasix
was increased to 60 mg. Home nurse noted O2 sat of 87% today at
rest and 79% with exertion, with O2 sats settling persistently
in the 70's at rest, which prompted the pt to come into the ED.

Of note ROS is remarkable for: stable 2 pillow orthopnea,
diminished exercise tolerance (one room length), chronic
productive nonbloody cough X 3 years and dysuria after
completing a 7 day course of ciprofloxacin recently. She also
endorses lightheadedness on the morning of admission, hx of
falls (last in [**2120-1-20**]), and increasing unsteadiness
recently that she attributes to recent hip replacement.
.
In the ED her vitals were 97.8 111 155/67 24, o2 sat 97% on
Non-rebreather. She received albuterol and ipratropium nebs,
levofloxacin 750mg and furosemide 60mg IV and ASA 81 mg. She
recovered and was saturating 99% on NRB on trnasfer to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].

IMAGING:
[**2120-7-12**] CXR - Pulmonary edema, bilateral effusions. Cannot
exclude retrocardiac opacity.
[**2120-7-15**] CARDIAC ECHO (TTE) - LA & RA are normal in cavity
size. Mild symmetric LVH with normal cavity size. Mild to
moderate regional LV systolic dysfunction with focal hypokinesis
of the inferolateral and anterolatreral walls. The remaining
segments contract normally (LVEF = 40 %). The estimated cardiac
index is normal (>=2.5L/min/m2). RV chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. No AS, mild to
moderate ([**11-22**]+) AR, mild (1+) MR, mild [1+] TR . The pulmonary
artery systolic pressure could not be quantified. There is no
pericardial effusion. IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with regional systolic dysfunction c/w
CAD (LCX terrigory). Mild-moderate aortic regurgitation. Dilated
ascending aorta.
[**2120-7-15**] CHEST (PA & LAT) - Since [**2120-7-12**] and
yesterday, lung volumes remain low. Bilateral subpleural
interstitial markings are still very prominent suggesting severe
interstitial lung disease. Cardiomegaly is unchanged. Bilateral
pleural effusions are small and unchanged, probably related to
residual prior CHF. Incidentally, severe degenerative changes
and deformity of both gleno-humeral joints are unchanged, mostly
prominent on the right. Thoracic deformity with S- shaped
scoliosis is unchanged. Baseline HRCT is recommended for further
characterization of underlying ILD.
[**2120-7-16**] High Resolution Chest CT: IMPRESSION:
1. The pattern of pulmonary fibrosis that favors fibrotic NSIP
over UIP.
2. Signs of cardiomegaly and pulmonary hypertension.
3. Two highly suspicious hypodense liver lesions.
4. Extensive degeneration and destruction at the level of the
shoulder
joints.

Brief Hospital Course:
82 y.o. F w/ CAD, CHF and reported COPD, who p/w hypoxia and
leukocytosis.

Hypoxia: The patient was admitted to the ICU for her hypoxia.
The hypoxia was multifactorial, due in large part to diastolic
CHF exacerbation (BNP [**2111**] on admission); with contributions
from underlying severe interstitial lung disease and possible
CAP given leukocytosis and infiltrate seen on admission CXR. She
ruled out for MI with Cardiac enzymes negative x 3. An echo
showed diminished systolic function EF 40% and inferior
hypokinesis. She was also started on IV diuresis for net
negative goal, with high dose lasix. A course of empiric
antibiotics to cover CAP and MRSA with azithromycin,
ceftriaxone, and vancomycin were started. Nebulizers and
Supplemental oxygen was provided with successful transition from
non-rebreather t
