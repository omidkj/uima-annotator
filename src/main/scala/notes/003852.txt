History of Present Illness:
Pt is an 85 yo lady w/ recent admit for NSTEMI, CHF ?EF, LE
cellulitis, Afib on coumadin, severe AS, who presents from [**Hospital 39437**] ICU w/ LGIB. She initially presented from a subacute
facility on [**2170-6-24**] with "mahogany stools" x 1 day. She had a
hct checked which was 29.9 from 34.2 on [**6-21**]. She was supposed
to have outpatient c scope/sigmoidoscopy, but then started
passing bright red clots and was admitted to the ICU. VS noted
to be BP 116/60, P 60's, sat 98%.
.
She was evaluated with a colonoscopy that showed blood
throughout the colon but "darker" on the right side. Small
polyps noted, but not removed. A larger 1.5 cm polyp noted at 40
cm in sigmoid that was bleeding from its base. This was not
removed [**2-7**] coagulopathy (INR 2.3), but endoloop placed at the
base and three hemoclips placed w/ good hemostasis. Non bleeding
hemorrhoids also noted. Since the procedure, patient has been
"oozing" blood and has required 2 units per day, totalling 7?
units since her admission, 3 units of FFP. She had a pan
positive bleeding scan throughout colon (see report below). She
remained hemodynamically stable throughout her admission and was
transferred here for further evaluation and treatment. Aspirin,
plavix, and coumadin were held. Vitamin K given as well.
Patient has been monitored in the MICU. She received blood
transfusions as well as FFP to reverse her coagulopathy ;
aspirin, plavix and coumadin were all held. She was evaluated by
GI and underwent a colonoscopy whihc demonstrated an AVM as the
cause of bleeding. The bleeding site was cauterized. She was
also found to have diverticulosis of the sigmoid colon that was
non-bleeding. Her hematocrit remained stable. MICU course was
complicated by episodes of desaturation whihc seemed to resolve
spontaneously and were thought to be secondary to mucus plugs.

Brief Hospital Course:
85F with history of NSTEMI, CHF, LE cellulitis, Afib on
coumadin, severe AS, who presented from [**Hospital3 26615**] ICU w/ LGIB.

.
1. GI bleed: Evidence of bleeding on colonoscopy with bleeding
polyp in the colon s/p endoloop placed at the base and three
hemoclips placed w/ good hemostasis but that continue to bleed.
Pt was seen by GI because she continued to have blood loss per
rectum. Given patient's recent MI there was concern for ischemia
if bleeding recurred. Pt was typed and crossed in the event of a
recurrent bleed.
.
2. Aortic stenosis: fluid balance was carefully regulated given
pt' pre load dependent status. Of note, Aortic Valve 0.8 cm;
gradient unknown.
.
3. CAD: Aspirin/plavix were held as was atenolol (pt
bradycardiac). Had recent NSTEMI ([**6-10**]) and CABG [**2161**]. EKG on
[**2170-7-4**] showed previous atrial fibrillation with PVCs, left axis
deviation, IV conduction defect and lateral ST-T changes likely
due to myocardial ischemia. The pt also continued to have a
persistent Trop leak that had been noted at the outside
(referring) hospital. During her admission, the pt did not
complain of any chest pain.
.
4. AF: given pt's GI bleed and relative bradycardia, coumadin
and beta-blocker were held, respectively.
.
5. CHF: EF unknown. We did decide to repeat echo if pt went into
respiratory  distress. We managed the pt's pleural effusions
with Lasix prn and gave her prbc's to prevent further cardiac
strain.
.
6. GI: was on flagyl 250 po tid at the OSH for presumed C.Diff.
She had no wbc elevation. We planned on sending stool cultures
in the event of future diarrhea suggestive of C. difficile. Pt
had a few episodes of LGIB and on colonoscopy was found to have
an AVM in transverse colon that was cauterized.

7. code: After discussion with the family it was decidde that
the patient's code status would be DNR/DNI and CMO.

** The patient expired on [**2170-7-4**] due to progressive respiratory
distress likely due to mucus plugging. She had a progressive
decline in mental status and was eventually at a risk for
aspirating. AFter extensive discussion with the family it was
decided that the staff would provide comfort only measures.
