Brief Hospital Course:
Pt was taken to the operating room for a laparoscopic right
colectomy. The procedure was converted to open because of
difficult adhesions after a previous laparotomy. The remainder
of the procedure was performed without complication and the
patient recovered from anesthesia without difficulty in the
PACU. He was taken to the ICU overnight for observation and
transferred to the floor the following morning. His ICU stay was
significant only for low urine output which improved once the
patient was restarted on his bumex. The patient was seen by the
pain service, and his pain controlled with a PCA which was
converted to PO medications once he would tolerate these.
Additionally, he was seen by the cardiology service, but had no
acute cardiac issues at this time. He was maintained on sips/IVF
until he had return of bowel function at which time his diet was
advanced to regular. On POD 4, the patient was discharged to
rehab to continue his physical therapy. At the time of discharge
he was tolerating a general diet, his pain was well controlled
and his abdominal exam was benign.
