Service:  MED ONCOLO

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:   This is a 59 year old male with
a recently diagnosed pancreatic cancer in [**2142-1-6**],
who is status post chemotherapy, who presented to the
Emergency Department today with complaints of worsening
dyspnea on exertion, new onset of orthopnea and generalized
weakness in the setting of mild bright red blood per rectum.

His dyspnea on exertion began on Thursday and has been
progressively worsening such that he is no longer able to
climb a flight of stairs.  No association with chest pain,
nausea, vomiting, diaphoresis.  He has also had new onset of
orthopnea and is now sleeping in a recliner.  He reports
generalized weakness since Saturday.  He reports orthostatic
symptoms, dizziness when getting up out of chair.

He has no documented coronary artery disease but had an
exercise treadmill test with nuclear imaging in [**2140-1-7**] with moderate reversible inferior perfusion defect.  His
last echocardiogram was also in [**2140-10-6**] with left
atrial enlargement, normal ejection fraction, minimal aortic
stenosis, one plus mitral regurgitation, one plus tricuspid
regurgitation.

Per the patient he was started on by mouth Lasix, unspecified
doses, last week, for fluid in his lungs.  He reports not
feeling greatly shortness of breath at that time and that the
Lasix was started for radiographic findings rather than
symptoms.  His dose was increased over the weekend because of
this progressive shortness of breath and he was told to go to
the Emergency Room on Monday if he did not improve.

He has had intermittent bright red blood per rectum for six
months, usually on toilet paper and sometimes in the stool.
The bleeding is small in amount and chronic.  He denies any
melena.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  He denies fevers, chills, headache, upper
respiratory infection symptoms or cough.  He does have a
chronic intermittent right upper quadrant pain, especially
after eating.  He denies diarrhea, constipation, or
straining; no dysuria.

In the Emergency Room, he had a blood pressure of 75/46 and
an oxygen saturation of 87% on room air on arrival.  His
rectal examination showed a small amount of red blood.  A
nasogastric lavage showed bilious fluid.  Initial hematocrit
was 17 with a potassium of 1.7.  He received three liters of
normal saline, one unit of fresh frozen plasma, 40 mEq of
potassium by mouth and 40 mEq of potassium intravenously.  He
was noted to be in atrial flutter with a controlled rate.  He
was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit.

near complete portal vein obstruction, mild ductal dilatation
of the common bile duct and intrahepatic duct, ascites on a
CT scan from [**2142-4-5**].  He is status post Gemcitabine now
undergoing Gemcitabine and Cisplatin for chemotherapy.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:   Temperature 98.6 F.; heart rate 84
laying down and 109 sitting up; blood pressure 102/49 laying
down, 98/46 sitting up; respiratory rate 24; 97% on three

LABORATORY:  White blood cell count of 8.0, hematocrit of

Chest x-ray showed bibasilar atelectasis, no pneumonia.  An
EKG showed atrial flutter with a rate in the 100s.  Normal
axis, but [**Street Address(2) 2914**] depressions in V4 through V6 with T
wave inversions and no evidence of heart strain.

He had a chest CT scan with angiography done which showed
multiple bilateral pulmonary emboli and possible pulmonary
metastatic disease.

ASSESSMENT:  This is a 59 year old male with a recently
diagnosed pancreatic cancer who presents with shortness of
breath found to have pulmonary emboli on chest CT scan, also
with concurrent bright red blood per rectum.

HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM:
1.  PULMONARY:  The patient had multiple bilateral pulmonary
emboli.  At first it was not clear given his bright red blood
per rectum whether or not he should be started on
anti-coagulation, however, GI was called, who advised to get
an esophagogastroduodenoscopy and colonoscopy within the next
few hours after his admission and defer any anti-coagulation
until after that.

Thus, the patient underwent a colonoscopy and nothing was
seen and he was then started on heparin and Coumadin until
his INR became therapeutic.  At the time of his discharge,
the patient's INR was therapeutic on Coumadin alone.

The patient was also seen to have a question of a pneumonia
based on a follow-up chest x-ray.  He was started on
Levofloxacin and received a five day course.

For his chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, the patient
was continued on Salmeterol inhalers, ipratropium inhalers
and fluticasone inhalers.  At the time of his discharge, his
room air oxygen saturation was 95% sitting, although 87%
ambulatory.  Thus, he was sent home with home oxygen.

2.  GASTROINTESTINAL:  As mentioned prior, the patient was
admitted with some bright red blood per rectum.  The patient
underwent a colonoscopy by the Gastrointestinal Service, who
did not find any lesions.  Thus, it was thought that he was
likely having these bleeds secondary to radiation proctitis.
He was transfused appropriately and his hematocrit
stabilized.

3.  CARDIOVASCULAR:  The patient had a history of presumed
coronary artery disease as he had had a prior positive stress
test in the past and has been placed on Imdur to prevent any
symptoms of chest pain.  The patient demonstrated atrial
flutter and he had been on Diltiazem to help control his
rate.  No further changes were made.  He was ruled out for a
myocardial infarction.

The patient has a history of hypercholesterolemia and was
continued on Atorvastatin.  The patient's blood pressure was
not elevated while he was hospitalized, thus, his usual home
Accupril was held.  It was thought that he would follow-up
with his primary care physician when he would
