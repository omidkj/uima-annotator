HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Patient is a 72-year-old white
male with a history of cardiomyopathy, history of myocardial
infarction 15 years ago, and a five vessel coronary artery
bypass graft 10 years ago, who is transferred from [**Hospital 11066**]
[**Hospital 107**] Hospital after presenting with two weeks of
progressive shortness of breath, chest heaviness, right
scapular pain, and palpitations.  Patient says that for one
or two weeks before presenting to the outside hospital, he
was experiencing shortness of breath mostly at night
associated with bilateral chest tightness.  He denies any
substernal chest pain, diaphoresis, presyncope, or dizziness.

He does admit to having paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, which
is improved with keeping his head elevated.  He sleeps with
one pillow.  He denies any orthopnea.  Patient says
previously he has never had these symptoms.  He denies any
history of chest pain or shortness of breath.  He denies any
exertional symptoms with good exercise tolerance in the past
without chest pain or shortness of breath.  Denies any pedal
edema or abdominal distention.

He has been experiencing episodes of palpitations, which have
lasted a few minutes, relieved with rest, and associated with
shortness of breath.  No chest pain, diaphoresis, or syncope.
Presented to outside hospital on [**12-2**].  Over the
course of the hospitalization, the patient continued to have
shortness of breath, but he ruled out for a myocardial
infarction.  He had an echocardiogram which showed an
ejection fraction of [**10-15**]% with severe mitral regurgitation.
He had a stress thallium which showed minimal no liability of
apical and septal segments.  The patient experienced
supraventricular tachycardia.  He was diagnosed as having
atrial fibrillation/atrial flutter.

He had been taking Quinidine which had been discontinued.  He
was started on amiodarone.  He is also started on ACE
inhibitor.  He had an episode of decreased urine output, and
his creatinine went from 1.5-2.6.  Has decreased by 7.5,
likely secondary to decrease cardiac output and renal
perfusion.

Electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm with a left bundle

IMPRESSION:  This is a 72-year-old white male who has
coronary artery disease who presents with symptoms of
congestive heart failure.

HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEMS:  1. Cardiac.  The patient was in
overt congestive heart failure.  Based on the previous
echocardiogram at the outside hospital, he had a very low
ejection fraction.  Physical examination was significant for
jugular venous distention and peripheral edema.  He did have
some crackles at the base of the lungs.  The initial plan was
for the patient to have a cardiac catheterization on the
second day of admission.

Initially his medications were continued including the
digoxin, the ACE inhibitor.  The Coumadin was held because of
the consenting of a potential procedure.  His aspirin,
nitroglycerin patch, and Lipitor were also continued.  He was
given Mucomyst prior to the catheterization.  He was also
sent for an echocardiogram.

He had a cardiac catheterization on the second day of
admission.  Results from the Catheterization Laboratory are
as follows:  The coronary arteries show a right dominant
system, left main coronary artery had an 80-90% ostial
lesion.  The left anterior descending artery had severe
proximal diffuse disease and then a mid total occlusion.
Left circumflex showed proximal occlusion with the distal A-V
groove vessels filled by left collaterals.  The right
coronary artery was not engaged.

The grafts are as follows:  The saphenous vein graft to the
left anterior descending artery was patent and supplied one
collateral to distal right coronary artery.  The saphenous
vein graft to the first branch of the obtuse marginal was
patent, supplied a large branching vessel collaterals to the
LPL.  Saphenous vein graft to the second obtuse marginal
arteries showed diffuse severe disease but supplied tiny
obtuse marginal.  Saphenous vein graft to the acute marginal
showed diffuse irregularities with ostial 50% stenosis and
the saphenous vein graft to the PDA showed diffuse stenoses
to 60%, but good flow.

Left ventriculography showed 3+ mitral regurgitation with an
left ventricular ejection fraction of 20%.  The aortography
showed 3+ aortic regurgitation with a left ventricular
ejection fraction of 20%.

His pressures were as follows:  His right atrial pressure
mean of 14.  His right ventricle had a pressure of 72/14.
Pulmonary artery was 81/45.  Pulmonary capillary wedge
pressure was 29.  Aortic pressure was 106/61.  His cardiac
index was 1.8 with a cardiac output of 3.75.

Because of his elevated filling pressures, he was given Lasix
80 mg IV and started on dobutamine to improve his cardiac
output.  The End Catheterization Laboratory post dobutamine
numbers were as follows:  The aortic pressure was 113/57 and
the pulmonary artery pressure was 79/38 entirely different to
the numbers previous to the dobutamine.  The cardiac output
after dobutamine was 7.72 and the cardiac index was 2.26
which were substantial increase in both numbers.

Because he was started on dobutamine, he was transferred from
the Catheterization Laboratory to the CCU for post-cath
management.  In the CCU, the patient was managed.  He had a
transthoracic echocardiogram done at the [**Hospital1 346**] which showed left atrial
enlargement, ejection fraction of 20%, and moderate aortic
regurgitation, 4+ mitral regurgitation, mild aortic stenosis,
and moderate pulmonary hypertension, and severe left
ventricular and right ventricular global hypokinesis.

The patient did not have any interventions in Catheterization
Laboratory.  He did not have a balloon pump because of the
severity of his aortic regurgitation.  He was on the
dobutamine to improve diuresis by improving his
cont
