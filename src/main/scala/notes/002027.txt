HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the Medical
Intensive Care Unit for further management of her
hypertensive urgency.  The patient was continued on a
Labetalol drip in the Intensive Care Unit, however, this was
discontinued on [**2174-5-4**], and she was started on her home
medications which include her Moexipril 15 b.i.d., her
Labetalol 1000 b.i.d., her Clonidine 0.6 b.i.d.  The patient
was also started on her Nifedipine initially at 90 mg q. day
which was her home dose.  This was increased to 120 q. day.
The patient had adequate control of her blood pressure on
this home regimen and was transferred out of the Intensive
Care Unit.  The patient also did initially receive some
Hydralazine in the Intensive Care Unit for prn control of
blood pressure.  This was run by the Rheumatology Consultants
and was deemed okay in light of her history.  The patient was
transferred out to the floor.  Once her blood pressure was
stabilized, she was continued on her home regimen with the
noted increase in her calcium channel blocker from 90 to 120
q. day.  She did not need any Hydralazine over night.  She
went to hemodialysis on the day of discharge where her blood
pressures were adequately maintained in the 120s to 130s.
Over night, on the night prior to discharge, her blood
pressures remained adequately controlled with systolic blood
pressures in the 130s to 150s.  The patient did not have any
further symptoms of headache or shortness of breath on the
floor.  She was continued on her 5 mg of Prednisone for her
history of lupus.  The patient also received a right upper
quadrant ultrasound on the day of discharge for further
evaluation of her hepatomegaly in the setting of normal liver
function tests.  The result of this right upper quadrant
ultrasound is still pending.  The patient did receive
hemodialysis on the day of discharge.  Her platelets remained
stable during the course of her hospital stay.  She does have
a history of idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura.  The
patient was consented for a human immunodeficiency virus
test, the result of this is still pending.  The patient will
be discharged on the following blood pressure regimen,
Labetalol 1000 mg p.o. b.i.d., Moexipril 50 mg p.o. b.i.d.,
Clonidine 0.6 mg p.o. b.i.d. and Nifedipine sustained release
120 mg p.o. q. day.  The patient has been scheduled for an
appointment with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] at the [**Hospital 191**] Clinic on [**2174-5-10**] for follow up of her blood pressure.  At that time if

should be considered.
