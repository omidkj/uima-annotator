HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 51-year-old gentlemen
with a known history of coronary artery disease who presented
to [**Hospital6 256**] for elective cardiac
catheterization on [**2100-10-8**].  As of results of
catheterization, he is referred to Cardiothoracic Surgery for
urgent coronary artery bypass graft.

Mr. [**Known lastname 39841**] had a history of having a percutaneous
transluminal coronary angioplasty in [**2091**].  This past [**Month (only) **]
while on [**Hospital3 **], he has a rescue percutaneous transluminal
coronary angioplasty stenting of his distal right coronary
artery for acute myocardial infarction.

On [**10-1**], he had an exercise tolerance test/thallium
where he exercised for nine minutes of [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] protocol and
stopped because of fatigue.  He had electrocardiogram changes
and sharp pain in the early recovery.  Ejection fraction was
calculated to be 46% and he had a moderate partially
reversible inferior defect.

He has done well until recently when he began to notice
recurrent symptoms.  He reports having chest tightness and
shortness of breath when exerting himself such as walking up
a slight incline.  Symptoms resolve with rest.

The patient denies any claudication, orthopnea, edema,
paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, lightheadedness.

Coronary artery disease risk factors:  Hypertension,
cholesterol, tobacco abuse, quit 10 years ago.  Denies
diabetes, positive family history and patient's father died
of an myocardial infarction at age 43.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Osteoarthritis, coronary artery
disease, status post myocardial infarction, renal stones,
recent retinal vein occlusion with minimal carotid artery
disease, sleep apnea, presently on CPAP.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Status post right shoulder surgery
for a rotator cuff injuries, status post surgery for deviated
septum.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Aspirin 325 po q.d., Lipitor 40 mg
po q.d., Toprol 100 po q.d., Wellbutrin 150 mg po b.i.d.,
Prozac 10 mg po b.i.d., Rhinocort 2 puffs q.d., Vitamins,
Accupril 10 mg po q.d.

ALLERGIES:  Sulfa, penicillin, tetracycline cause swelling
and rash, shellfish and dye.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs:  Heart rate 70.  Blood
pressure 108/70.  General:  Appearance, well-dressed,
well-nourished gentlemen appearing his stated age in no
apparent distress.  Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat:  No
jugular venous distention, carotids without bruits.  Lungs:
Clear to auscultation bilaterally.  Cardiac:  Regular rate
and rhythm, no murmur. Abdomen:  Soft, nontender,
nondistended.  Neurological:  Alert and oriented times three,
nonfocal.  Extremities:  Bilateral peripheral pulses.  No
varicosities.

KEY STUDIES:

Results of cardiac catheterization from [**2100-10-17**]:

1.  Left anterior descending with 50% diffuse proximal and
60-70% diffuse mid vessel disease, 80% proximal stenosis of
the first diagonal.  Left circumflex has diffuse disease and
70% stenosis of the first obtuse marginal.  The right
coronary artery has 30% mid vessel and 50% focal occlusion.

2.  Resting hemodynamics revealed mildly elevated systolic
and left ventricular filling pressures.

3.  Left ventriculography revealed mild anterolateral
hypokinesis and severe posterobasal inferior hypokinesis with
an ejection fraction of 35%.

4.  Successful percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty
of OM1 with type C dissection.

BRIEF SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:   The patient was referred
to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 70**] for an emergent coronary artery bypass
graft.  Patient was brought to the Operating Room on the
evening of [**2100-10-17**].  Coronary artery bypass graft
times four vessels and anastomosis between his left internal
mammary artery to the left anterior descending artery.
Radial artery graph was used as a conduit to the first obtuse
marginal  artery.  Saphenous vein graft was used for an
anastomosis to the diagonal and a saphenous vein graft was
used in anastomosis to the right posterior descending artery.
The patient tolerated the procedure well and was brought from
the Operating Room to the Intensive Care Unit on propofol,
nitroglycerin and Neo-Synephrine drip.

In the Intensive Care Unit, the patient was extubated on the
first postoperative day, but remained on a Neo-Synephrine
drip until postoperative day number two, when the
Neo-Synephrine was able to be weaned off.  Once
Neo-Synephrine was taken off, patient had his PA catheter
course introducer removed.  On postoperative day number
three, the patient was transferred to the Patient Care Floor.
By the time the patient reached the floor, his chest tubes
had been removed.  On postoperative day number four, the
patient was out of bed and ambulating to a level 3,
tolerating a diet and his pacer wires were removed.  By
postoperative day number five, the patient was ambulating at
a level 5 and was tolerating a full diet.  His pain was
controlled and was voiding and felt ready to go home.

DISPOSITION:  Discharged home.

CONDITION OF DISCHARGE:  Stable.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Lasix 20 mg po b.i.d. times one week.
2.  KCL 20 mg po b.i.d. while on Lasix.
3.  Colace 100 mg po b.i.d.
4.  Aspirin 81 mg po q.d.
5.  Imdur 30 mg po q.d.
6.  Lipitor 40 mg po q.d.
7.  Ibuprofen 400-600 mg po q. 6 hours.
8.  Percocet 1-2 tablets po q. 4-6 hours.
9.  Wellbutrin 150 mg po b.i.d.
10. Prozac 10 mg po q.d.
11. Lopressor 50 mg po b.i.d.

FOLLOW-UP:  The patient will follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], his
primary care physician, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] three weeks and will see Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 70**] in Clinic in six weeks.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:  Status post coronary artery bypass
graft, four vessels including left internal mammary artery to
left anterior descending, radial artery to OM1, saphenous
vein graft to D1, saphenous vein graft to right posterior
descending artery.
