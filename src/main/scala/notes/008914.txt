History of Present Illness:
60yo man with h/o TB infection diagnosed at [**Hospital1 18**] [**2191**],
reportedly treated with 1yr 4-drug therapy, HTN, hyperlipidemia,
type II diabetes mellitus, and depression/PTSD who presented to
[**Hospital1 18**] ED today with SOB.
.
Per ED records and review of OMR, patient presented to [**Hospital 11074**]
clinic at [**Hospital **] Health Center [**2193-9-3**] with complaints of weeks
of left-sided pleuritic chest pain.  He denies cough and
hemoptysis at that time.  Lab studies and CXR done.  He awoke at
4AM [**2193-9-6**] with shortness of breath and presented to ED.
Initial vitals: T 98.6  HR 120, BP 167/106, RR 12  97%RA.  ECG
showed sinus tachycardia with rate 110 bpm, nml axis, nml
intervals, isolated ST-elevated V3, ST-depression V4-V6,
nonsignificant Q-wave III, no TWI.  In the ED he received
aspirin, levofloxacin, albuterol and atrovent nebs.  Initial CXR
showed LUL cavitary lesion decreasing in size, parenchymal
RUL/LUL changes, increased vascularity and bronchial cuffing; no
effusion.  First set of cardiac enzymes negative with CK 107;
Trop <0.01.  He has no known cardiac disease.
.
The patient became acutely agitated with worsening shortness of
breath.  He did not respond to further nebulizer treatments and
was intubated in the ED for concern of flash pulmonary edema.
He was treated with lasix 40mg iv, solumedrol, and started on
nitroglycerin gtt.  He then received 5mg iv metoprol and became
hypotensive with BP 78/50.  He received a 500cc bolus iv fluids,
nitroglycerin gtt d/c'd.

ECHO [**9-9**]:
1.The left atrium is normal in size.
2.Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. There is severe global left
ventricular hypokinesis. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is severely depressed.
3. Right ventricular chamber size is normal. The views of the
right ventricle are limited to make the proper assessment of the
right ventricle.
4.The aortic root is mildly dilated. The ascending aorta is
mildly dilated. The aortic arch is moderately dilated.
5. The aortic valve is mildly thickened.Trace aortic
regurgitation is seen.
6.The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate (2+)
mitral regurgitation is seen.
7.The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal.
8. No pericardial effusion is present.

Exercise MIBI [**9-10**]:  IMPRESSION: Global hypokinesis with enlarged
left ventricular size consitent with dilated cardiomyopathy. No
perfusion abnormalities. Calculated LVEF of 25%.


Brief Hospital Course:
Brief Overview:  60 yo patient presented to ED with SOB and
developed flash pulmon edema in ED.  After intubation in the [**Name (NI) **],
pt brought up to MICU sedated. He was extubated the next day,
stabilized, r/o'd for TB, and tx to [**Hospital Unit Name 196**] service.  Echo showed
EF 15-20%, stress showed no reversible changes.  Pt was started
on BB, ACEI, continued on ASA and set up for close follow-up
with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 437**] in cards clinic and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 11616**], his PMD.

Course By Systems:
MICU:  Pt was taken, intubated, to MICU.  An a-line was placed,
and the pt was stable overnight. CTA showed no PE. In the am, he
became more awake and agitated, pulling at his tube and trying
to speak. He was extubated and given 40 mg Lasix IV.  Sputum x 2
were neg for AFB and then it was confirmed that the pt had been
adequately treated for his past pulmon TB and w/u was
discontinued.  The pt remained stable, echo was obtained and pt
was transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 196**].

# Systolic heart failure: EF of 15-20%, no LV enlargement on
echo, but dilation seen on stress MIBI.  proBNP on admission of
1252.  The pt was called out from the MICU and remained stable.
Echo showed a severely decreased LVEF (15-20%) without LV
dilation.  Stress MIBI showed no reversible defects but showed
an enlarged ventricle.  In addition, the pt ruled out for MI by
enzymes.  He was diuresed with 20mg of IV lasix with good
diuresis.  He was negative 0.5-1L each day for 3 days.  He was
started on a beta blocker and ace inhibitor.  His breathing
improved, his lungs remained clear, and he had no further
problems as a result of his CHF.  The cause of the systolic CHF
is unknown, however it could be due to longstanding HTN/DM2.
There is also a history of etoh abuse that seems to extend back
25 years with "drinking until I passed out" frequently until the
last few years when he drinks only [**3-14**] drinks/day.  Labs for
hemochromatosis, SPEP/[**Last Name (LF) 66046**], [**First Name3 (LF) **], HIV, lyme titer, and TSH are
pending at the time of discharge.  The patinet was set up with
close follow-up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 437**] in cardiology and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 11616**],
his PMD.
.
# DMII: Held oral agents because metformin is contraindicated
prior to cath and it was unclear if cath would be needed.  RISS
was implemented.  BG was well controlled and the pt was
discharged on his home medications for DM (actos and metformin).

.
# HTN: BB was used to control.  The pt had SBP in the 130's to
140's throughout his course with occasional 120's readings.  On
discharge, the pt was managed with Toprol and Lisinopril.  Due
to a HR in the 60's, the pt was given Toprol 25 (equivalent to
hospital dose) and Lisinopril 20 (increase from inpt acei
dosage).
.
# FEN: Pt was maintained on PO diet of consist carbohydrate and
heart healthy.
