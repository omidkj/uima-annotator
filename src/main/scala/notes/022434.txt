This is a 71 year old patient admitted on [**2200-4-23**].
Discharge date anticipated [**2200-5-16**] was cancelled. This
is a continuation of the hospital course from the discharge
summary, document #[**Numeric Identifier 56754**].

HOSPITAL COURSE, CONTINUED:  The patient's discharge was
delayed. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] of the interventional radiology service
saw the patient regarding vertebroplasty for her lumbar
compression fracture. An MRI was obtained, which demonstrated
a compression fracture of the anterior aspect of the L2
vertebral body, with minimal associated T2 and STIR signal
abnormalities. The remaining vertebral bodies were normal in
height, signal and alignment. There were no epidural
collections seen. The conus medullaris ends at L1-L2, and
there was no spinal cord narrowing. Also noted on the scan
was a large left retroperitoneal hematoma in a patient who is
status post thoraco-abdominal aortic aneurysm repair. There
was some edema in the muscular soft tissues posterior to the
lumbar spine at the levels of L2 to L4. These findings could
reflect dependent changes related to the patient's
longstanding supine positioning. At this point, a
vertebroplasty was deferred.

The patient in the next 24 hours developed onset of abdominal
pain and diarrhea. Abdominal CT was obtained. This CT of the
abdomen and pelvis did not show any evidence of thoraco-
aortic dissection. There was a persisting small bowel
obstruction, which had partially decompressed, and the left
abdominal wall had a surgical site seroma. The thoraco-
abdominal aneurysm repair was stable in appearance. The
appearance of the stenosis of the origin of the SMA, celiac
and right renal arteries was stable. The patient then
proceeded to surgery on [**2200-5-16**], and underwent
abdominal aortogram with selective celiac angiogram,
angioplasty, and stenting of the celiac artery through a left
brachial artery access. The patient tolerated the procedure
well and was transferred to the post anesthesia care unit in
stable condition, and returned to the VICU for continued
monitoring and care. The patient's postoperative day 1 from
her angioplasty and stenting of the celiac artery was
hemodynamically stable. White count was 13.4, hematocrit
31.5, BUN 30, creatinine 1.0. Physical examination was
remarkable for a soft, nontender abdomen with bowel sounds.
The nasogastric tube was removed and the diet was advanced as
tolerated. Ambulation was continued. The patient was
continued on TPN.

Over the next 24 hours, the patient tolerated liquids. The
TPN was continued. Physical therapy continued to work with
the patient. Psychiatry was requested to see the patient
because of a history of depression. The patient's head CT
scan was remarkable for periventricular white matter changes
and an old right insular infarct. Psychiatric felt that the
patient's [**Last Name 16423**] problem was delirium, which was mild and
which was related to surgery and all the perioperative events
in an older woman with underlying structurally abnormal
brain. There was no evidence of anxiety present.
Recommendations were to discontinue the Ativan, give the
patient Haldol 0.5 - 1 mg IV every 4-6 hours p.r.n. for
anxiety or confusion, minimize the use of Dilaudid, or
replace with a non narcotic analgesic. The patient did
experience episodes of somnolence with Ativan and narcotics.
The narcotics were withdrawn, and the Ativan was tapered
accordingly, with improvement in the patient's somnolence.
The patient continued to show improvement, and was
transferred to the regular nursing floor on [**2200-5-22**]. The TPN
was weaned, and she was continued on diet advanced as
tolerated. Case Management was requested to begin screening
for rehab. The finalization of the [**Hospital 228**] hospital course
will be dictated at the time of discharge to rehab.
