Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1711**]
Chief Complaint:
chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none


History of Present Illness:
.
HPI collated via OSH ED, CT surgery, and [**Hospital1 18**] notes and briefly
corroborated with daughter as pt. intubated at time of
admission.
.
82 yo woman with history of COPD, who initially presented to [**Hospital **] for dyspnea and chest pain. Per family had been dyspneic
x 3 weeks with increasing fatigue, wanting to sleep all the
time, with chills, cough but no fever. Dyspnea was exertional
and worse with increasing anxiety. She began to have
intermittent chest pain radiating to back yesterday so went to
[**Hospital3 **] for evaluation. At [**Hospital3 **] she had stable EKG, CT
scan which showed thoracic aortic aneurysm with concern for
dissection/leak. She was also noted to have some wheezes and was
given solumedrol 125mg x 1 (sats 97% on her home o2). SBPs at
that time 130s, so she was started on labetalol, and transferred
to [**Hospital1 18**] for CT surgical evaluation.
When she arrived in ED, VS showed SBP in 70s, 02 sats 97%, HR 68
Labetalol stopped and given IVFs with return of SBPS to
90s-100s. She had bedside ECHO which showed small pericardial
effusion. At this point, pt. was intubated given some borderline
O2 sats, potential for directly going to OR, and for TEE
requested by Cardiac Surgery. Cardiology performed TEE which
showed small effusion without tamponade and large intramural
aortic hematoma with echogenic texture suggestive of chronicity
and no evidence of aortic dissection. Per ED resident, pt. was
felt to be a high risk operative candidate, so decision with
family was for medical management. Pt. remained hypotensive and
started on levophed after placement of IJ in ED.
.
On review of symptoms per OSH ED note, she denied any prior
history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary
embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint
pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools. He denies
recent fevers, chills or rigors. He denies exertional buttock or
calf pain. All of the other review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for chest pain and dyspnea
on exertion as above. No reports of paroxysmal nocturnal
dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or
presyncope.

Pertinent Results:
MEDICAL DECISION MAKING
.
Studies:
CT Chest with contrast: no filling defects, minor atelectasis
without infiltrates, aneurysmal dilatation of ascending thoracic
aorta with with rupture and mediastinal hematoma per OSH
hospital read.
CXR:
SINGLE VIEW CHEST, SUPINE PORTABLE: The ET tube is approximately
3.9 cm above the carina. The NG tube courses below the diaphragm
into the stomach. There is widening of the superior mediastinum,
which correlates to ascending aortic
intramural hematoma with aneurysm formation as seen on outside
hospital CT.
The pulmonary vasculature is within normal limits allowing for
technique.
.
IMPRESSION: Appropriate placement of NG and ET tubes.
.
ECG demonstrated sinus bradycardia at 57, with Qtc 483, stable
from OSH, non specific TWF in inferior and lateral leads with no
old comparison. Per OSH ECG read, has been brady to 47 before.
.
TELEMETRY form [**Hospital3 **] demonstrates 11 episode of SVT, ?
Afib, spontaneously reverted.
.
2D-ECHOCARDIOGRAM performed on [**4-19**] demonstrated:
Transesophageal ECHO:
The left atrium is dilated. No thrombus/mass is seen in the body
of the left atrium. No mass or thrombus is seen in the right
atrium or right atrial appendage. Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function are normal
(LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. The ascending aorta is moderately dilated. A
crescent-shaped, eccentric, laminar thickening of the distal
ascending aorta is seen, which is consistent with an intramural
hematoma or possible thrombosed dissection flap. It measures
18mm in maximal thickness and appears relatively echogenic,
which is suggestive of chronicity. There are complex (>4mm)
atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. The majority of the
descending thoracic aorta and arch is not well seen due to poor
probe contact. [**Name (NI) **] aortic dissection flap is seen. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is no aortic
valve stenosis or regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate [2+]
tricuspid regurgitation is seen. The pulmonic valve leaflets are
thickened. There is a small pericardial effusion, which is
largest at the apex (0.9cm) with no evidence of tamponade or
right ventricular diastolic invagination.
.
IMPRESSION: Moderate dilatation of the ascending aorta with
large eccentric intramural aortic hematoma or thrombosed
dissection flap with echogenic texture suggestive of chronicity.
No evidence of free aortic dissection flap. Small pericardial
effusion with no echocardiographic evidence of tamponade. Normal
biventricular function.

Brief Hospital Course:
# Aortic Aneurysm: Patient was initially transfered from an OSH
with a concern for leaking of known thoracic aortic aneurysm.
TEE done here showed moderate dilatation of the ascending aorta
with large eccentric intramural aortic hematoma or thrombosed
dissection flap with echogenic texture suggestive of chronicity.
No evidence of free aortic dissection flap.  CT surgery was
consulted and they did not recommend surgical interven
