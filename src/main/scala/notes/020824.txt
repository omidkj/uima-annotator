HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 50226**] is an
83-year-old Greek-speaking gentleman, who was at
rehabilitation.  He was transferred to the Medical Intensive
Care Unit from [**Hospital3 **] on [**10-3**] for
hypotension and possible sepsis and then ruled in for a
myocardial infarction.

The patient has known coronary artery disease with a
myocardial infarction in [**2153**], and unstable angina, with
catheterization in [**2158-9-13**] which showed 3-vessel
disease (70% left main, 90% proximal right coronary artery,
95% distal right coronary artery, 70% ramus, and 50% second
obtuse marginal).  An adenosine MIBI done at the same showed
reversible inferior wall and lateral wall defects.  The
patient refused a coronary artery bypass graft at that time.

The patient had a recent admission to [**Hospital 882**] Hospital for
urosepsis from [**9-21**] to [**9-27**].  During that time, he
had intermittent angina with flat creatine kinase levels but
with increased troponin I levels which peaked at 5.8.  The
patient completed a course of levofloxacin two days prior to
admission.

On the day prior to admission, the patient experienced some
left-sided chest pain and was found to have a temperature of
100.6 degrees Fahrenheit.  The patient had complained of
chills and diaphoresis and was noted to be tachycardic to
100.  His blood pressure was 88/50.  He was taken to the
Emergency Department where he received ceftriaxone,
vancomycin, and Flagyl.  His white blood cell count on
admission was 38.2, and his initial creatine kinase was 287.

Electrocardiogram on admission showed a normal sinus rhythm
at a rate of 75 with first-degree atrioventricular block and
right bundle-branch block; which was unchanged from prior
electrocardiogram.

The patient was transferred to the Medical Intensive Care
Unit where his blood pressure improved with fluid boluses and
where he was maintained on antibiotics.  The patient remained
afebrile, and his white blood cell count decreased on
antibiotics.  The patient ruled in for a myocardial
infarction with a creatine kinase that peaked at 642 and a
troponin I that peaked at 1.68.  The patient was placed on
heparin and Integrilin as well as aspirin and a beta blocker.
His diuretics were held.

The patient was sent directly to the Cardiac Catheterization
Laboratory from the Medical Intensive Care Unit for stenting
of his right coronary artery lesion and was admitted from the
Cardiac Catheterization Laboratory to the Cardiology floor.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
 1.  Coronary artery disease.
(a)  Status post non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction in
[**2153**].
(b)  Status post percutaneous transluminal coronary
angioplasty in [**2154-2-11**].
(c)  status post catheterization in [**2158-9-13**] which
showed a 70% stenosis of the left main coronary artery, and
90% stenosis of the proximal right coronary artery, and 95%
stenosis of the distal right coronary artery, and 70%
stenosis of the ramus, and 50% stenosis of the second obtuse
marginal.
(d)  Adenosine MIBI in [**2158-9-13**] showed reversible
inferior wall and lateral wall defects.  The patient has
refused coronary artery bypass graft.
 2.  Congestive heart failure (with an ejection fraction of
58%).
 3.  Hypertension.
 4.  Aortic stenosis with an aortic valve area of 0.87 cm2.
 5.  Parkinson disease.
 6.  Anemia.
 7.  Gout.
 8.  Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.
 9.  Spinal stenosis.
10.  Benign prostatic hypertrophy.
11.  Methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia
in the past.
12.  Osteoarthritis.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
 1.  Neurontin 300 mg by mouth three times per day.
 2.  Colace 100 mg by mouth twice per day.
 3.  Finasteride 5 mg by mouth every day.
 4.  Sinemet 25/100 by mouth three times per day.
 5.  Simvastatin 40 mg by mouth once per day.
 6.  Protonix 40 mg by mouth once per day.
 7.  Heparin infusion.
 8.  Enteric-coated aspirin by mouth once per day.
 9.  Zosyn.
10.  Vancomycin.
11.  Integrilin infusion.

ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives at [**Hospital3 **].
His granddaughter is his health care proxy.  The patient is
wheelchair dependent due to his spinal stenosis.  The patient
is Greek-speaking.  Of note, the patient has received all of
his care at [**Hospital6 1708**].

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:   On physical
examination, the patient's temperature was 98.1 degrees
Fahrenheit, his heart rate was 63 to 75, his blood pressure
was 152/80, his respiratory rate was 16, and the patient's
oxygen saturation was 100% on 2 liters of oxygen.  Physical
examination was notable only for lungs which were clear
anteriorly with no wheezes.  Cardiovascular examination was
regular with a 4/6 systolic ejection murmur at the right
upper sternal border with radiation to the carotids and heard
throughout the precordium.  The abdomen was obese with no
masses or tenderness.  There was 3+ peripheral edema
bilaterally.  It was difficult to evaluate the jugular venous
pulsation due to the patient's obesity.

PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:   On transfer to
the floor, laboratories were notable for a white blood cell
count of 18 (which had decreased from 38.2), his hematocrit
was 27.4 (which had decreased from 32.1), and his creatinine
was 1.2 (which had decreased from 1.4 on admission).

CONCISE SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE BY ISSUE/SYSTEM:  The
patient was admitted to the Cardiology Service.

1.  CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE ISSUES:  The patient has a
history of coronary artery disease, status post
non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction in [**2153**] and 3-vessel
disease (including left main disease).

The patient ruled in for a myocardial infarction on this
admission with a troponin T peak of 1.68 and a creatine
kinase peak of 652.  The patient was maintained on aspirin,
statin, heparin, Integrilin, and a beta blocker.

The patient was taken to the Cardiac Catheterization
Laboratory on [**10-4**].  This catheterization revealed left
main 50% ostial and 50% distal lesions.  Left anterior
descending artery with 40% mid vessel disease.  Left
circumflex with an 80% ostial at the takeoff of the ramus.
The right coronary artery was small and co-dominant with 70%
to 80% lesion.  Moderate aortic stenosis.  No intervention
was pursued given the high ramus takeoff and the 50% left
main disease.  The patient was felt to be at too high a risk,
and it was recommended that he be evaluated for a coronary
artery bypass graft and aortic valve replacement.

Imdur was started status post procedure.  The possibility of
a coronary artery bypass graft was discussed with the patient
who refused a coronary artery bypass graft and preferred
medical management at this time.  The patient was stabilized
on the above cardiac medications with no further recurrence
of chest pain or signs of ischemia.

2.  HYPERTENSION ISSUES:  Initially, the patient's
antihypertensive medications were held due to his low blood
pressure; however, they were restarted during this hospital
stay without any adverse effects.

3.  INFECTIOUS DISEASE ISSUES:  All blood cultures and urine
cultures were negative throughout the [**Hospital 228**] hospital
stay.  The patient remained afebrile with no increased white
blood cell count.  Therefore, his antibiotics were
discontinued on [**10-6**].  He remained without any signs of
infection.

4.  ACUTE RENAL FAILURE ISSUES:  The patient was noted to
have an increased creatinine on admission; however, his
creatinine decreased with intravenous fluids, suggesting a
prerenal etiology.  The patient was given Mucomyst prior to
catheterization, and his ACE inhibitor and diuretics were
held prior to catheterization and restarted prior to
discharge.

5.  DECREASED HEMATOCRIT ISSUES:  The patient was noted to
have a hematocrit which decreased to 27.4.  He did receive
one unit of packed red blood cells in order to maintain his
hematocrit above 30.  His stools were guaiac-positive, but he
was continued on his heparin and Integrilin considering the
setting of acute coronary syndrome.
