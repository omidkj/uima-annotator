Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the ICU for monitoring and serial
hematocrits.
She had normal coagulation panel and her hematocrit dropped from
36 to 27 the lowest.

An urgent GI consult was called and the pt underwent EGD which
demonstrated
Findings: Esophagus: Normal esophagus.
Stomach:
 Contents: Large volume of blood and food particles were seen in
the gastric remnant. Erythromycin was given to facilitate
passage of gastric content, but was minimally successful.
 Excavated Lesions A single large cratered 2 cm ulcer was found
in the GJ anastamosis. A clot suggestive of recent bleeding was
nearby the ulcer. The ulcer was irrigated vigorously with
sterile water. Upon achieving adequate visualization of the
ulcer, a total of 15 cc of 1:[**Numeric Identifier 961**] epinephrine was injected
successfully in increments of 1.5 cc into multiple quadrants of
the ulcer for hemostasis.
Small intestine: Normal small intestine
Impression: Large ulcer at the GJ anastamosis. Hemostasis was
successfully achieved with multiple epinephrine injections.

Recommendations: NPO except essential medications
Serial Hct's.
Protonix 40 mg twice daily
Sulcrafate suspension 1 gm QID
Monitor in ICU setting. Pt is at moderate to high risk for
