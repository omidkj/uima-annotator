Chief Complaint:
worsening shortness of breath, severe aortic stenosis, here to
get corevalve

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
corevalve [**2149-7-8**]

History of Present Illness:
Cardiac Surgeon: Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) **], MD
Cardiologist:  Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], MD

Referring Physician: [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 171**], MD
PCP:[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], MD

Reason for Consult: severe aortic stenosis

Chief Complaint: worsening shortness of breath

HPI: 89 year old gentleman with history of severe aortic
stenosis
followed by serial echocardiograms. In [**Month (only) 205**] he had a lower
gastrointestinal bleed on coumadin and work-up revealed an
adenocarcinoma. Given his critical aortic stenosis, he underwent
an aortic valvuloplasty so that he could undergo a
hemicolectomy.
His valve area improved from 0.68cm2 to 0.82cm2. Postoperative
course was complicated by heparin induced thrombocytopenia. In
regards to his aortic stenosis, he continues to be symptomatic
with increasing fatigue over the last few months, shortness of
breath after going up 5 stairs, shortness of breath with walking
on an incline. He denies chest pain or lightheadedness. Family
reports a decline in his functional status. He was evaluated by
cardiac surgery and deemed to be of prohibitive extreme surgical
risk for conventional surgical AVR. After informed consent, he
was screened for Corevalve TAVR. He met all inclusion criteria
and did not meet exclusion criteria. He is admitted for
transfemoral TAVR procedure.

Cardiac Catheterization: Study Date 	[**2148-6-21**]
Interventional details
Crossed the aortic valve with a straight wire through a 5 French
[**Doctor Last Name **]-1 catheter.  Advanced a 20 mm x 6 cm Tyshak balloon and
inflated while rapid ventricular pacing at 200 bpm to arrest the
heart.  A single manual inflation was performed without
incident.
Peak to peak gradient decreased from 60 mm hg to 25 mm Hg
approximately with an increase in systemic blood pressure.
   Assessment & Recommendations
1.	No significant coronary disease
2.	Sheath out when ACT <180 seconds
3.	8 Hours bed rest.
