Brief Hospital Course:
Assessment and Plan: 79 yo female with PMH DM, hyperlipidemia,
HTN admitted with one week history of chest pain and EKG
changes. S/p cardiac catherization with diagnosis of 3vd.
Potential CABG candidate but had cath instead because of anemia
and no transfusion.  The patient was admitted to the CCU.

1. CAD: Cardiac cath findings: LMCA 50% distal; LAD 80-90%; LCx
OM 80-90%, RCA 100%. Attempt to open occluded RCA, unable to
perform. Recommended consideration of CABG and no PTCA completed
on the first cath. Left ventriculography: LVEF 50%, inferior
hypokinesis. No significant MR. Pt seen by CT surgery but was
unsure of her CABG potential given her Jehovahs Witness beliefs
and her anemia. All caring for the patient explained to her that
given her age and anemia, she would have a very high chance of
needing a life-saving blood transfusion during the CABG. The
patient accepted that this was a risk and decided to undergo a
high risk cath instead of CABG. On [**11-23**] she returned to cath for
intervention - stents to LAD. During her entire stay, she
continued to have intermittent chest pain without changes in
vital signs, cardiac enzymes, or EKG changes. Her Imdur was
titrated up because of this. She was discharged on Imdur,
aspirin, Plavix, Lipitor, avapro, and cardizem, (BB cause
wheezing).
2. DM: continued humalin 25u qam
3. CRI:  given mucomyst peri-cath
4. Anemia: Likely iron deficiency anemia. Started on Epogen and
iron.
5. Code status: FULL code. No blood products (Jehovah's witness)

6. Social: The patient has a large family whom she relies on
heavily for decision making. The discussion about CABG vs. cath
was difficult because her family insisted that there were places
in the country that would do CABG without blood transfusions.
However, it was explained to them by all members of the medical
team, including CT surgery, that her risk was of morbidity or
mortality without blood transfusions was unacceptably high.
