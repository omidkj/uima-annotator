Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 13541**]
Chief Complaint:
Chief complaint:Initially presented to OSH ([**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Doctor First Name **]) with
generalized weakness and chest pain after HD.
MICU admit for:OSH transfer for respiratory distress


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
PICC line placement.


History of Present Illness:
79F with complicated PMH including ESRD on HD 3x/week, CAD, DM,
h/o c. diff. Of note pt was hospitalized at [**Hospital1 18**] last in
[**2130-1-24**] with complicated ICU course with multiple severe
infections (including pseudomonas VAP, CMV viremia and VRE
bactermia), respiratory failure requiring intubation and
eventual tracheostomy and PEG placement. Pt was formerly a
resident of [**Doctor Last Name **] NH, presented from there after HD to St.
[**Hospital **] hospital with complaint of 1 week of generalized weakness
and 1 day of chest pain. At the OSH she was dound to be in AF
with RVR. Ruled out for MI with serial enzymes. Was found to
have a UTI which was treated initially with renally dosed
levaquin. On CXR had evolving LLL infiltrate with pleural
effusion. Per their records she had recently completed a course
of bactrim for an abdominal cellulitis/rash and had been
completing a course of vancomycin for a MRSA infection at her HD
catheter site. She was treated with flagyl prophylactically
while on other abx given hx of c. diff. Had 1/4 bottles blood
cultures + for GPCs, given linezolid x 1 d until cx resulted
CNS, considered contaminant. Was started on zosyn for LLL
infiltrate. Urine cultures resulted as e. coli resistant to
levaquin and zosyn, sensitive to 3rd gen cephalosporins.
Pulmonary service consulted, recommended continuing flagyl,
discontinuing levaquin and zosyn and starting ceftriaxone. On
[**7-15**] while at HD pt had an episode of bradycardia and
hypotension, after which her digoxin was held and metoprolol
dose was decreased. Her PNA coverage was broadened to imipenem
to cover for pseudomonas in setting of worsening CXR. In early
am of [**7-16**] pt had acute respiratory distress with desat to
30-50%, was suctioned, placed transiently on bipap (which she
did not tolerate), CXR showed interval L lung whiteout. Bronch
was offered but refused by the family, pt remained firmly DNI.
On repeat suctioning, large mucous plug extracted and pt recoved
with 02 sats ~100% on NRB. Pt's family requested tx to [**Hospital1 18**] for
continued care.
.
On arrival to [**Hospital1 18**] ICU pt appeared comfortable, VSS, sating
well on NC. Denied pain, stated she was not SOB and that her
breathing was back to baseline. Son stated that she would
occasionally have substernal CP during dialysis that radiated to
her back. Currently denies CP.

CXR: [**2130-7-19**]: Since prior study, there has been no relevant
change in bilateral left greater than right effusions as well as
retrocardiac opacity. The right PICC and dialysis catheter are
in unchanged positions. There is no pulmonary edema.
.
CXR: [**2130-7-17**]: As compared to the previous radiograph, there is
no relevant change. The position of the left-sided central
venous access line is unchanged. Also unchanged is the size of
the cardiac silhouette and the left-sided parenchymal
consolidation with air bronchograms. There is no evidence of
newly occurred focal parenchymal opacities


Brief Hospital Course:
1. LLL pneumonia: At [**Hospital1 18**], she was briefly observed in the ICU,
where she did well and was transferred to the floor 24 hours
later. She had no oxygen requirement, although repeat chest
imaging did demonstrate a left retrocardiac opacity. Repeated
sputum cultures were unrevealing, and blood cultures all
remained negative. She
essentially completed 7 days of various antimicrobial agents for
pneumonia coverage.

2. E. coli lower UTI: She was placed on Meropenem to cover for
her resistant E. coli UTI (ESBL qualities, although still noted
as sensitive to third generation cephalosporins), and will
complete a 7-day course of therapy (last day on [**7-22**]).

3. History of C. difficile colitis: Flagyl PO was continued,
with the plan to continue therapy at least 7 days beyond
completion of the above Meropenem course given her history of C.
difficile colitis.

4. Possible recent line infection: She was continued on
Vancomycin for a period of time, discontinued on [**7-19**] given no
clear evidence of MRSA infection. Repeated blood cultures
remained negative.

5. ESRD on HD: She was followed by the renal service during her
hospitalization, and underwent dialysis three times weekly
(Tu/Th/Sat).

6. Atrial fibrillation: Rate controlled with beta blockade
therapy, which was titrated. Digoxin was NOT restarted. We will
defer the decision to initiate
anticoagulation to you, since her outside physicians elected not
to start it, and I see in her records that she has a prior
history of GI bleeding.

Her other problems remains relatively stable in the hospital.

Medications: Meropenem was continued with a plan for a 7 day
course.  Flagyl was started as patient on multiple antibiotics
and having some diarrhea.  Flagyl course for ten days.
Metoprolol 25 mg [**Hospital1 **].  Can be titrated up to heart rate of 65 as
long as pressure tolerates.
