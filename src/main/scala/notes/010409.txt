Imaging
[**2198-4-20**] Head CT: IMPRESSION: No intracranial hemorrhage is
identified.
[**2198-4-20**] CT C-spine IMPRESSION: No fracture or dislocation is
identified within the cervical vertebrae. Degenerative changes
are seen at multiple levels, most pronounced at the C5-C6 level,
with moderate to severe spinal canal stenosis
CT of Abd/Pelvis IMPRESSION:
1. Small extracapsular hematoma adjacent to the right posterior
liver.
2. Small low attenuation left hepatic focus, which is too small
to be characterized. If the patient sustained trauma to this
area, this could represent a small contusion.
3. Small right pleural effusion.
4. Defect of right L3 lamina, which does not appear to be an
acute finding.
5. Extensive atherosclerotic disease involving the aorta,
mesenteric and renal vessels

EEG [**2198-4-23**] IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal routine EEG due to a
slowed background rhythm with intermittent generalized delta
frequency slowing. These findings suggest deep, midline
subcortical dysfunction and are
consistent with an encephalopathy. Common causes include
infection,
metabolic abnormalities, and medication affects. No lateralizing
or
epileptiform abnormalities were seen.


Brief Hospital Course:
TSICU [**Date range (3) 93066**]
After initial stabilization in the trauma bay, the patient was
taken to the CT scanner for imaging studies. His only
significant injury related to the trauma of the MVC was a small
subcapsular hematoma of his liver. However, the patient began to
develop shortness of breath in the trauma bay after obtaining
his CT scans. He had been supine for a considerable length of
time and was also under a significant stress [**1-3**] the MVC. At no
time did he complain of chest pain. A chest x-ray was obtained
showing possible CHF. An ECG did not show any ischemic changes.
The patient has severe underlying cardiac disease with a
depressed ejection fraction predisposing him to pulmonary edema.
The patients blood pressure climbed to 200/100 and he was
tachypneic and tachycardic. He was treated with IV lasix, oxygen
and started on a nitro drip. Cardiology was called and the CHF
team was consulted for optimal management. The patient quickly
improved, but was monitored overnight in the ICU.

[**Date range (3) 93067**]: The following day the patient was transferred
to the hospital floor and cardiology was consulted regarding his
outpatient heart failure/CV medications. He was continued on his
beta-blocker, ace, and statin, but his asa and plavix were held
[**1-3**] his hematoma. Throughout the [**Hospital 228**] hospital course,
serial HCTs were done and they remained stable indicating no
significant bleeding from the hematoma. The patient was
restarted on his asa and plavix on [**4-22**]. The patient has an
underlying severely compromised cerebral blood as evidenced by
prior MRI/MRA. He had no memory of the accident and neurology
was consulted at the request of cardiology to help optimize his
blood pressure to ensure adequate cerebral perfusion while not
putting extra stress on his heart. Neuro recommended a goal SBP
of >120. The patient also has a L subclavian stent that requires
coumadin dosing. The patient should not be restarted on his
coumadin until 1 week post injury which is Friday [**4-27**]. Once
the patient has a theraputic INR his plavix may be discontinued.
The patient had a urine sample checked and was discovered to
have a UTI. The culture is susceptible to E Coli and bactrim was
prescribed and should be taken for 5 days after discharge.

The patient was evaluated by Physical and Occupational therapy
who found him to have good strength and mobility but to be of
considerable safety risk to himself in that he was unable to
answer appropriately when asked the names/doses of his
medications, what he would do in an emergency and also was noted
to have difficulty in tasks with concentration and memory.
Therefore placement was arranged in a SNIF. On the day of
discharge the patient was tolerating PO, was afebrile, voiding
well, and was agreeable to placement. Cardiology and neurology
were both aware of the patient's discharge planning.
