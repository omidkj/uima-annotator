History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 47417**] is a 63 y/o woman with PMH of stage IV breast
cancer with cutaneous & liver mets who presents to the ED with
worsening dyspnea. The patient states that she began therapy
with Megace on [**2156-7-21**]. Following initiation of therapy she
noticed lower extremity edema which progressed over several
weeks; she discontinued therapy on [**2156-8-13**] but the edema
persisted. Over the past several weeks, she has noticed
increasing dyspnea on exertion. She has 14 stairs in her home
and has noted increased difficulty in climbing them. At times,
she must stop to rest halfway up the flight. She denies
orthopnea, PND, chest pain, palpitations, and
dizziness/lightheadedness. She was given HCTZ to "help with
fluid" per her report; she has been taking 25 mg daily without
much improvement in her edema.
.
In addition, the patient had two separate bleeds from her
external tumor which were substantial per her report. On [**9-13**] and
[**9-20**], the patient bled from her tumor, requiring multiple
washcloths and prolonged application of pressure to stop the
bleeding. She denies any hematuria or blood in her stools.
.
In the ED, the patient was afebrile and 91% on RA; sats
increased to 97-98% on 3L NC. She had borderline low blood
pressures in the 80s/40s but maintained her mentation and urine
output; baseline BPs in the 100s per her report. She has
continued HCTZ as above at home. CTA of the chest demonstrated
no pulmonary embolism but a large R sided pleural effusion.
Blood cultures were sent, and she received levofloxacin 500 mg
IV X 1 for treatment of pneumonia. She also received 1 L NS and
was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for further management. On arrival
to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], the patient states that her breathing is "much
better." She appears comfortable and is only complaining of
chest wall pain and back pain due to "all the moving around."
.
ROS: Feels thirsty. Appetite and PO intake good per her report.
No headache, sore throat, trouble swallowing, nausea/vomiting,
abdominal pain, diarrhea, constipation, bloody stools, dysuria,
or hematuria per her report.

   FLUID CULTURE (Final [**2156-9-27**]):    NO GROWTH.

   ANAEROBIC CULTURE (Final [**2156-9-30**]):    NO GROWTH.

Pleural fluid cytology: Positve for malignant cells consistent
with metastatic breast cancer

Pleural fluid found to be exudative ([**1-14**] lights criteria were
positive)>

CT chest [**2156-9-23**]:
CONCLUSION:
1. No pulmonary embolism or aortic dissection.
2. Large bibasal effusions with passive atelectasis at the lung
bases, more on the right. Small lung nodules in right middle
lobe worrisome for metastases.
3. Extensive metastatic disease involving the breasts and the
subcutaneous tissues of the chest and abdomen.
4. Metastatic disease in the liver and evidence of prior
chemoembolization. Abdominal lymph nodes are incompletely
covered/ assessed on this chest CTA and may be further evaluated
with a dedicated CT abdomen.

CXR [**2156-9-27**] (two days following Thoracentesis).
IMPRESSION: Bilateral pleural effusions, slightly increasing.
