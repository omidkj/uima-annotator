PNA with ceftin. Returned to OSH [**Date range (1) 25885**] with UTI (e coli),
Ciff colitis. Rx'd with levo/flagyl. Hosp course c/b hypoxia of
unclear etiology. D/c'd home on O2. During week PTA, noted to be
weak, fatigued, and diff. concentrating. On night of admission,
noted acute onset SOB. Taken to [**Location (un) **] ED. ABG 7.2/109/180.
Trial of bipap failed. Intubated and sent to [**Hospital1 18**] as no ICU
beds at [**Location (un) **].

Past Medical History:
PMH:
1) ?COPD: no PFTs. prn nebs in past
2) PNA: [**8-1**]. ?RUL
3) AAA: infrarenal. >5 cm. declined surgery

5) LVH on EKG


Brief Hospital Course:
She was intubated on admission for hypercarbic respiratory
failure.  Systemic steroid was started for COPD exacerbation.
She was successfully extubated on hospital day 3.  Echocardigram
obtained on admission showed new systolic heart failure with
LVEF of 15 to 20% and global hypokinesis. Also developed new
atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate shortly after
extubation, controlled with PO medications.

# Pulm: previous hypercarbic resp failure was likely COPD flare
(unclear precipitant, perhaps C diff) & also some component of
CHF. Extubated [**8-30**], currently stable on NC. Was on solumedrol
IV, now on prednisone taper & stable. Continued on albut,
ipratrop ATC, salmeterol, fluticasone

# Rhythm: new Afib w/RVR on [**8-31**], was on metop 100 tid & dilt 60
qid. Pt refusing DCCV and likely wouldn't stay in NSR anyway
given dilated heart. Continue beta blocker, diltiazem. Started
digoxin on [**9-4**] w/good effect. Also started coumadin (for Afib &
poor EF) on [**9-3**], now INR therapeutic. Will need further
titration as outpatient with INR checks.

# CHF: new LV systolic dysfxn (severe LV HK) seen on Echo. EF
15-20%, down from 54% in ??????01. 2+ MR/2+ TR. Likely ischemic given
wall motion abn (global but AK in inf/lat). For dilated CM w/u,
TSH/FT4 WNL, iron studies WNL. Clinically euvolemic currently.
- strict I&O, low-Na+ diet
- restarted low-dose captopril as will help w/remodeling,
titrating up; plan to switch to lisinopril at d/c
- would be candidate for AICD given EF but pt declines any
invasive procedures

# CAD: was likely ischemia causing poor EF, but not ongoing as
cardiac enzymes WNL; Pt/family refusing cath or even stress test
so cont med management for presumed CAD. Cont ASA, Bblocker,
Lipitor.

# ID: C diff dx at OSH; atelec vs PNA vs aspiration on CXR [**8-31**];
WBC WNL, afebrile, no S/Sx infection so will defer Abx for now.
Monitor. Flagyl course ended on [**9-2**].

# AAA: stable, pt defered [**Doctor First Name **] for this yrs ago; cont BP control
# FEN: tolerated POs well
# PPX: hep sc, H2 blocker
# Code: full, confirmed w/family
# Communic: daughter - [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) 10743**] (cell [**Telephone/Fax (1) 25886**],
