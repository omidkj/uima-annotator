Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2485**]
Chief Complaint:
Hypotension

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
bronchoscopy


History of Present Illness:
49 year old female with persistent vegetative state secondary to
a pontine bleed in [**7-/2170**], with tracheostomy and PEG tube, and
history of pseudomonal UTI (also ? history of MRSA), and NSTEMI
with EF 35-40% at [**Hospital1 2177**] in [**9-/2170**], presenting from rehab with
fever and hypotension.
.
Per rehab records, the patient had a fever of 102.5 on the night
of [**4-15**] at around 11 p.m., with BP 101/69 at the time. She was
given vancomycin and ceftriaxone, and had blood cultures drawn.
Over the next hour of so, her BP was noted to decline to 79/42
at which point she received 2 liters of normal saline, and had a
dose of flagyl added as well. A dopamine drip was started at
rehab and she was transported to [**Hospital1 18**].
.
Vital signs on arrival to the ED were T103, HR 113, BP 65/37,
98% on AC, 600x8, 40%, PEEP 5. She recieved 3 liters of normal
saline and had a right IJ precept catheter placed, with mixed
venous O2 sat 92%. She was changed to norepinephrine from
dopamine (started at rehab) after right IJ placed. EKG revealed
sinus tachycardia initially with TWI and ST depressions in
V3-V6, however while there she also experienced atrial
fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, with heart rate
decreasing with fluid administration. Labs were notable for
hematocrit of 22 - she was ordered for PRBC transfusion. She had
a positive UA with mod LE and 11-20 wbcs. CXR demonsrated mild
CHF with a possible infiltrate at the left base. She received
vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and zosyn


Past Medical History:
1) Pontine hemorrhage in [**7-/2170**], with resultant persistant
vegetative state, treated at [**Hospital1 18**] where she received a
tracheostomy and PEG tube.
2) Hypertension
3) Pseudomonal UTI at [**Hospital1 2177**] in 9/[**2170**].
4) NSTEMI, medically managed, at [**Hospital1 2177**] in 9/[**2170**]. EF 35-40% on
echo after the MI.


Social History:
Social History: Former smoker, was previously living with a
boyfriend, now lives at [**Hospital3 672**] rehab.


Family History:
Family History: non-contributory

Physical Exam:
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: 102.6, 115/63, 102 (sinus tach), AC
600x10, 40%, PEEP 5, Pip 27. CVP 14 in ED, ScvO2 96.
GENERAL: Obese hispanic female, unresponsive to painful stimuli,
with tracheostomy, ventilated.
HEENT: Pupils are 2-3 mm and fixed. No occulocephalic reflex.
She has a 2cm ulcer on the right occiput and posterior aspect of
right pinna.
NECK: Trach collar in place, right IJ central line.
COR: RR, tachycardic, no murmurs.
LUNGS: Coarse breath sounds, with scattered rhonchi.
ABDOMEN: G tube (modified foley catheter) in place, no obvious
erythema or exudate. Diminished bowel sounds.
BACK: Large gluteal pressure ulcer with clean borders, no
surrounding erythema, however very deep with exposed underlying
subcutaneous tissues.
EXTR: Large pressure ulcer on posterior left heel with necrotic
eschar. No edema.
NEURO: Pupils not reactive, extremities flaccid with increasing
tone very distally in the DIPs, PIPs, and ankles. Mute plantar
response. Twitching of left lower lip.

[**5-16**] Cxr:
CHEST, AP PORTABLE: The patient has a tracheostomy. The heart is
markedly enlarged with mild pulmonary edema. In addition, there
is a left lower lobe opacity obscuring the left hemidiaphragm
suggesting atelectasis or pneumonia. No definite effusion. No
pneumothorax.

IMPRESSION: Mild congestive heart failure. Left lower lobe
opacity, atelectasis versus pneumonia.
.
EEG [**5-16**]:
IMPRESSION: This was an abnormal routine portable EEG due to the

presence of sharp waves in the right central region, suggestive
an area
of cortical hypersynchrony. These discharges did appear rhythmic
at 1Hz
briefly but no clear clinical correlate was appreciated. At
other
times, twitching the mouth was noted, however only muscle
artifacts were
seen and no clear epileptiform discharges were seen to correlate
with
these movements. However, focal motor seizures involving a very
small
seizure focus may not have a clear electrographic correlate. The
slow
background is suggestive of a diffuse encephalopathy
.
echo [**5-17**]:
Conclusions:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity size, and systolic function are normal
(LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall
motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal.
There is a small to moderate sized pericardial effusion most
prominent inferior to the basal left ventricle and around the
right atrium with minimal fluid anterior to the right ventricle
and around the left ventricular apex. Hemodynamic significance
is not suggested (but can be masked with ventilated patients).
IMPRESSION: Preserved global biventricular systolic function.
Small-moderate pericardial effusion as described above.
.
[**5-24**] echo:
Conclusions:
The left atrium is normal in size. There is moderate symmetric
left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion
abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).  Right ventricular
chamber size is normal. Right ventricular systolic function is
borderline normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic
regurgitation. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with
trivial mitral regurgitation. The pulmonary artery systolic
pressure could not be determined. There is a moderate to large
sized pericardial effusion. The effusion appears
circumferential. The effusion is echo dense consistent with
probable hematoma with partial organization. There is no
definite echocardiographic evidence for tamponade but the right
ventricle may be compressed. Clinical correlation recommended.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2171-5-17**],
the pericardial effusion is now much larger and more organized.

.
[**5-27**] echo:
Conclusions:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and systolic
function (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free
wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion. The mitral
valve leaflets are structurally normal. The estimated pulmonary
artery systolic pressure is normal. There is a moderate sized
(1cm anterior to right ventricle, 1.5cm around LV apex and
lateral to left ventricle), circumferential, partially
echo-filled pericardial effusion with mild right atrial and
intermittent right ventricular diastolic collapse consistent
with impaired fillling/tamponade physiology.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2171-5-24**],
the effusion is similar in size. There is increased echogenicity
of the effusion c/w
progressive organization and right atrial diastolic collapse is
more obvious c/w increased pericardial pressure/tamponade
physiology.
.
[**2171-5-30**] echo:
Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and systolic
function are normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size
and free wall motion are normal.
