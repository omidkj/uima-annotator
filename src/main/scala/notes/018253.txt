Change in mental status, hematemesis

EGD

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 71441**] is a 78 year-old woman with a history of a recent
left-sided stroke with subsequent left carotid stenting and
initiation of warfarin therapy for atrial fibrillation who was
brought in from [**Hospital 100**] Rehab today for deteriorating mental
status.  She is intubated and sedated, and thus unable to
provide her own history.  Per EMS records, she was noted by
staff this morning to be unresponsive around 8am this morning.
She had a FSBG that was >600 at that time, and other labs were
significant for a hematocrit of 19.6 from a baseline of 27, a
creatinine of 3.8 and PT of 23.6.  She was noted at that time to
be responsive only to painful stimuli with a pinpoint right
pupil (midline, reactive left pupil) and left facial droop.
When her labs returned to, EMS was called.  When EMS attempted
intubation, she had a gag reflex and vomitted a small amount of
coffe ground material.
.
Upon arrival to the ED, her heart rate was in teh 80s with a BP
of 100/60 and an O2 Sat of 100%.  She was intubated for airway
protection and, per the ED resident, the patient had a difficult
intubation in that she had episodes of bradycardia requiring
atropine.  GI was called and a gastric lavage via her PEG
revealed coffe ground material without any fresh blood.  She
received 2 units of fresh frozen plasma, 4 units of PRBCs, and
10 mg of SC phytonadione.  A femoral line was placed for
emergent IV access.  She was also given ampicillin/sulbactam for
a dirty urinalysis.
.
Of note, during her recent hospitalization, she was noted to
drop her hematocrit from 32.8 on admission down to a nadir of
24.1; this responded to 29.3 with 2 units of PRBCs on [**2172-11-9**].
Two days later, her hematocrit had drifted down to 26.9 and she
was given an additional 2 units of PRBCs with a response up to
35.0.  By the time of discharge, her hematocrit was back down to
27.2, though stable.

Pertinent Results:
ECG ([**2172-11-29**]):
Normal sinus rhythm at 91 bpm, normal axis, normal intervals, no
obvious ST segment changes, though unsteady baseline may be
obscuring subtle ST segment changes.
.
Head CT w/o contrast ([**2172-11-29**]):
No evidence of intracranial hemorrhage. Marked mucosal
thickening within the nasal cavity and ethmoid air cells without
fluid levels to suggest the presence of acute sinusitis.
Small-vessel angiopathy as described.
.
CXR ([**2172-11-29**]):
The lung volumes are diminished.  No focal consolidation,
pneumothorax or pleural effusion is detected.  The
cardiomediastinal contour is within normal limits.  ET tube
terminates 1.5 cm above the carina.  NG tube enters the stomach.
 The tip has been excluded.
.
[**11-30**] EGD:
Impression:
Normal mucosa in the esophagus
Blood in the fundus
There was some superficial ulceration with a small amount of
oozing from around the G tube. No other bleeding site seen.
Patent rotated for maximum visability given presence of large
clot.
Normal mucosa in the duodenum
Otherwise normal EGD to second part of the duodenum
.
Recommendations: serial hematocrits
[**Hospital1 **] proton pump inhibitor
Repeat EGD if acutely rebleeds
AP CHEST 10:05 P.M, [**12-2**]

HISTORY: Increased wheezing, crackles and dyspnea, assess for
aspiration or pneumonia.

IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**11-29**]:

Lung volumes are very low, and the anatomic detail in the lungs
is obscured by respiratory motion, but there appears to be new
consolidation in the right mid and upper lung consistent with
pneumonia due to aspiration. Moderate cardiomegaly has increased
also and there is no mediastinal vascular engorgement suggesting
cardiac decompensation, though I doubt that edema is present.
Pleural effusion if any is small, decreased since [**11-29**]. No
pneumothorax.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 71441**] is a 78 year-old woman with a recent left-sided
ischemic stroke and subsequent left internal carotid stenting
who presents with altered mental status following a large GI
bleed in the setting of recent initiation of aspirin,
clopidogrel, and warfarin.
.
## Acute blood loss anemia secondary to GI blood loss: Hct on
admission was as low as 15.  She was admitted to the MICU and
monitored with serial Hcts.  She received 4 units of PRBCs
intially with Hct rise to 29. She received an EGD which showed
blood in the fundus and superficial ulceration surrounding the G
tube but no active bleeding. She was continued on [**Hospital1 **] PPI.  Her
aspirin, plavix, and coumadin were initially held. The following
day her plavix and aspirin were restarted.  Aspirin was
decreased to 81 mg.  Her coumadin was held and should likely not
be restarted in the future given multiple episodes of
significant GI bleeds. Following her EGD, her Hct continued to
slowly trend down to 25 and she received another unit of PRBCs
with appropriate response to 30. Upon transfer to the floor her
vital signs were stable and her hematocrit remained between
28-30. She was scheduled follow up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 572**] of GI on [**12-7**]
and neurology to decide on restarting coumadin weighing the
risks of GIB and recurrent stroke.
.
## Altered mental status: Unclear cause.  Had evidence of UTI on
admission. Also potentially secondary to hypoperfusion in the
setting of profound anemia.  Also possible contribution of
uremia given concurrent renal failure.  Head CT without any
acute change. Toxicology scre
