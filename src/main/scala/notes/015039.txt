Chief Complaint:
hypotension

History of Present Illness:
78yo female w/ well-differentiated lung cancer s/p recent cyber
knife radiation, COPD, and Afib on dabigatran here w/ increasing
cough productive of green sputum. Two nights prioir to admission
 she began having fevers. She has a chronic cough, but it
worsened and became productive of green sputum. She always has
some wheezing. Seen yesterday at [**Hospital 392**] rehab and nursing center
and started on ceftriaxone, azithromycin and methylprednisolone
4mg QID. CXR and UA there were normal, WBC count 18K. When her
respiratory symptoms worsened, she was transferred to the ED.

In the ED, initial vs were: T 98.4 P 110 BP 92/59 R 18 O2 sat
100% RA. She spiked to 102.4 and was found to have ronchi at
left base. Exam notable for irregularly irregular heartrate and
a L-sided facial droop on exam. Labs showed WBC count of 32,000,
lactate 1.8. CXR had LLL pneumonia. Got 1gm vanc, 750mg
levaquin. Seen by neurology who thought she had a Bell's Palsy
and recommend a non-urgent MRI head. She dropped her pressures
to SBPs in the 70s-80s. R IJ CVL placed. Got 2L IV fluids, 1gm
Tylenol. Vital signs prior to transfer were HR 105 BP 111/64 on
.03mg/min norepinephrine, O2 sat 99% 2L.

On the floor, she described a vague malaise, but cannot specify
further. She says her breathing is near her baseline. Denies
lightheadedness, chest pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea or
dysuria. She has had occasional constipation. Denies rash,
myalgias or arthralgias. Denies diplopia or weakness. She has
been walking normally.

Imaging:
CHEST (PA & LAT) Study Date of [**2167-1-30**] 2:54 PM
IMPRESSION: Left lower lobe pneumonia, new compared with
[**2167-1-5**].
.
HEAD CT W/O CONTRAST: IMPRESSION:
1. No acute intracranial process. 2. Small vessel ischemic
disease. 3. Prominent sulci and ventricles, likely age-related
involutionary changes.
.
CTA CHEST [**2-1**]: IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of SVC abnormality.
2. New left lower lobe patchy airspace opacity and tree-in-[**Male First Name (un) 239**]
opacity in the right lung suggests multifocal infection.
3. Limited evaluation of the known left lower lobe lung cancer
with new
nodules in the right upper and lower lobes that could represent
metastatic disease versus infection.
4. Cholelithiasis.

CXR [**2167-2-8**] Left lower lobe consolidation is again noted
slightly more prominent on todays study compared to [**2167-2-5**], but markedly improved since initial presentation on [**1-30**], [**2166**]. There is no pleural effusion. Right IJ line projects
over the mid svc.
.
CXR [**2167-2-10**]:There is a right central venous catheter with the
tip overlying the mid SVC.
There is persistent consolidation of the left lung base,
unchanged in
appearance compared to prior. No new focal consolidation is
appreciated.
Fiducial markers are again seen in the posterior basal segment
of left lower lobe overlying an area of known bronchogenic
carcinoma. The bilateral upper lobes and right lung are clear.
The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are within normal
limits. There is no vascular engorgement or pleural effusion.
IMPRESSION:
Stable appearance of the left lower lobe consolidation. Central
venous
catheter with the distal tip in the mid SVC.
.

Brief Hospital Course:
78yo female with history of lung cancer s/p recent radiation
admitted with pneumonia, COPD exacerbation, fever, hypotension,
and atrial fibrillation with RVR on dabigatran. The patient was
evaluated in the emergency room and blood, sputum, and urine
cultures were sent. Admission CXR revealed a LLL pneumonia that
was treated as hospital acquired with vancomycin, cefepime, and
levofloxacin; because she was admitted from a rehab facility.
She was admitted initially to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] with hypotension
requiring levophed and IVF. She was quickly weaned off pressors,
stabalized, and tranferred to the floor the following morning;
where she was treated with frequent nebulizers and po steroids
as well as antibiotics. Though initially stable, the patient
subsequently triggered four times in 24 hours for respiratory
decompensation and afib with RVR requiring transfer back to the
unit. The episodes were manifest by marked wheezing and
tachypnea to the high 20's and low 30's (though the patient
maintained O2 saturation on RA). Her wheezing was treated with
nebulizers and O2. During these decompensations, her HR became
elevated in the 150's to 160's in Afib and she became
hypotensive to SBP's in the high 80's to low 90's with the first
3 episodes (although she maintained mentation and urine output).
During the 4th trigger, the patient remained normotensive
despite her RVR. The patient's HR was controlled initially with
metoprolol po and IV, but she was subsequently changed to
diltiazem at the time of her [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] transfer in case the beta
blocker was contributing to her COPD exacerbation. Wit
