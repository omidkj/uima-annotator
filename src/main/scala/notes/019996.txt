History of Present Illness:
85 year old Russian-speaking found to be hypotensive (SBP 70's)
at home and was brought to [**Hospital1 18**] by daughter. Pt was lethargic
at home, poor oral intake with associated diarrhea past 2 days.
Of note, patient was recently admitted to [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1495**] [**Doctor First Name **]
twice this past month for CHF exacerbation and UTI where she was
started on an antibiotic (unclear from family) and subsequently
readmitted with diarrhea and abdominal pain. She was discharged
with flagyl and per family, had a colonoscopy which was
unrevealing. She had also just completed her antibiotics
(clarithromycin, amoxicillin) for H.pylori gastritis.
.
While in ED, she was still hypotensive (SBP 80's) and was given
6L of IVF. A foley and (L)IJ CVL was placed for more invasive
monitoring. Levophed and empiric antibiotics were started. CT
scan performed concerning for pan-colitis.

IMAGING:
CT abd/pelvis [**2151-3-2**]:
1. Diffuse infectious/inflammatory colitis, incompletely
evaluated due to collapsed bowel and lack of oral contrast.
Pseudomembranous colitis is also a consideration, correlate with
recent medication use.
2. Distended gallbladder with stones and sludge.
3. Small bilateral pleural effusions.
4. Left adnexal cyst 2x2cm with calcification within it.
.
[**2151-3-4**] AP CXR:
As compared to the previous examination, there is a newly
appeared retrocardiac opacity suggesting retrocardiac
atelectasis. The presence of a minimal left-sided pleural
effusion cannot be excluded given the blunting of the left
costophrenic sinus. The course and position of the left-sided
central venous access line indicates position of the catheter
tip in the azygos vein. Otherwise, no relevant changes. Known
configuration of the cardiac silhouette, no newly appeared focal
parenchymal opacity suggesting pneumonia.
.
[**2151-3-5**] ECHO:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. No left atrial mass/thrombus
seen (best excluded by transesophageal echocardiography). No
atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. The
estimated right atrial pressure is 0-5 mmHg. Left ventricular
wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. Due to suboptimal
technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be
fully excluded. There is mild to moderate regional left
ventricular systolic dysfunction with severe hypokinesis of the
inferior wall and abnormal septal motion. There is mild
hypokinesis of the remaining segments (LVEF = 40%). The right
ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with mild global free wall
hypokinesis. The ascending aorta and aortic arch are mildly
dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but
aortic stenosis is not present. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation
is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There
is no mitral valve prolapse. An eccentric, jet of moderate (2+)
mitral regurgitation is seen directed along the interatrial
septum. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is
mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. Significant
pulmonic regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial
effusion.

IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Regional and global left
ventricular systolic suggestive of multivessel CAD or other
diffuse process. Moderate mitral regurgitation suggestive of
papillary muscle dysfunction. Moderate tricuspid regurgitation.
Pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. Right ventricular cavity
enlargement with free wall hypokinesis.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the General Surgical Service on
[**2151-3-2**] for evaluation and treatment of hypotension and severe
diarrhea, with concern of clostridium difficile colitis given
recent multiple antibiotic exposure. Admission abdominal/pelvic
CT revealed findings consistent with diffuse infe
