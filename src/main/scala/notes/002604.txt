History of Present Illness:
47M with history of OSA/COPD, bipolar, schizophrenia presenting
with increased somnolence and respiratory distress. At
approximately 940 this morning, patient was found by staff at
nursing home to be acute SOB with altered MS. [**Name14 (STitle) 103309**] to 53% on
RA. Was placed on 15L O2 non-rebreather, and O2 sat came up to
88%.  [**Name6 (MD) **] by NP, who called EMS.  On EMS arrival, GCS
reportedly 8. Given nebs, BiPAP, manually bagging, then with
improvement to GCS of 11. But even after nebs, poor breath
sounds bilaterally.

Nursing home reports patient has been well and at baseline
(independent except in bathing and dressing) until yesterday,
when we felt fatigued.  This morning he did not come to
breakfast, so staff went to see him in his room, where he was
found to be SOB, as above.  Was oriented and asked to see
doctor, but fatigued and with occassional jerking motions of
hand.  Last med change was increase in metformin on [**7-19**].  No
other recent med changes.  Nurse gives him meds.  No vomiting,
diarrhea, or decreased PO intake.  Has been using BiPAP
consistently for OSA/COPD at night.

In the [**Name (NI) **], pt continued to have poor breath sounds B/L.  He
responded to voice and sternal rubs, not responding to commands.
 No wheezing or crackles, just poor air movement.  He was on
BiPAP in ED, then woke up and complained of back pain, and he
was given 30mg IV Toradol.  First ABG showed PO2 140, PCO2 93,
pH 7.21, bicarb 39.  He then desatted again, and became more
somnolent.  At that point, he was intubated (1 attempt, not
difficult airway).  He does have trach scar (hx of difficulty
weaning from vent).  He had fluffy infiltrates on CXR and very
dry, tea-colored urine.  He got fluid, but was hypotensive.  He
got RIJ line and was started on levophed once placement was
confirmed.  Potassium was 7.7 on arrival, so he was given 10U of
insulin, 1 amp of calcium gluc, 1 amp D50, repeat 7.3.  In ED
was satting 88% on 100% FiO2 on vent with good air movement.
Azithromycin and solumedrol 125 for presumed copd.  In terms of
hi BP, he 75/50 before pressor.  He came up to 101/64 now after
levophed.  His HR was 64, rr18, sat 87%.  Before pt came up to
MICU, he bradyed to 35, then came back up to 70.  ED talked to
cardiology, may have had mobitz 2 or complete heart block when
bradyed, then 1st degree avblock after.  Renal fellow will see
in micu.

On arrival patient is responsive to voice and sternal rub. Does
not follow commands.
