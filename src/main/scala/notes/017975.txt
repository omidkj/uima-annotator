Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2297**]
Chief Complaint:
Altered mental status, respiratory failure.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
This is a 68 yo M with h/o COPD and HTN who initially presented
to the neurology service on [**6-20**] with AMS who is now being
transferred to the MICU for HTN urgency and hypoxia. The pt had
been in his USOH until he returned from [**Country 4754**] approximately
[**2-4**] wks ago and felt fatigued. He subsequently experienced
visual changes, emotional lability, and confusion. An outpt head
MRI/MRA revealed total stenosis of the [**Doctor First Name 3098**] but no ischemic
infarcts. He was then tx'd to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**6-20**] after presenting to
an OSH with slurred speech. Since being on the neurology
service, he has had a EEG negative for szs, rpt MRI/MRA head
without ischemia or temporal lobe enhancement, and LP that was
significant for lymphocytic pleocytosis (WBC 85, 95% lymphs).

Pertinent Results:
IMAGING:

[**2159-7-4**] Evoked Potentials: BRAIN STEM AUDITORY EVOKED POTENTIAL
(08-044): After stimulation of either ear there were very poorly
formed (and likely unreliable) evoked potential peaks including
wave I and probably waves III and V, but the latencies were
extremely difficult to determine. They all appeared to occur
within normal limits.
The study is unreliable but suggests some brain stem activity.
A possible explanation is involvement of the VIIIth nerve
peripherally,
dampening and distorting subsequent peaks.

[**2159-7-1**] EEG: Probably abnormal EEG with no clear overriding
background
rhythm seen largely because of superimposed beta activity which
could be
medication effect. This tracing could be consistent with an
encephalopathic process but further repeat study, as clinically
indicated, would be of further diagnostic benefit. There was no
overt
epileptiform or subclinical electrographic seizure activity
seen.

[**2159-7-13**] EEG: IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal EEG due to the
presence of a slow and disorganized background consistent with a
moderate encephalopathy of toxic, metabolic, or anoxic etiology.
Note is made that with the observed movements, no epileptiform
activity occurred.


Brief Hospital Course:
OVERALL HOSPITAL COURSE SUMMARY:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was transferred to the MICU due to respiratory
failure on the neurology floor from a combination of aspiration
PNA and hypertensive urgency leading to flash pulmonary edema.
In the MICU, his major problems were AMS, respiratory failure,
blood pressure lability, tremors.  These were attributed to
likely encephalitis, possibly viral in etiology.  He had an
extensive neurologic workup for causes of his encephalitis
(labs, imaging, EEG, etc) and all of these results were
negative.  His family brought up the possibility of an anti-NMDA
receptor antibody mediated encephalitis as a possible cause, and
CSF was sent to UPenn for special analysis; the Anti-NMDA Ab was
negative.  After this, his family made him DNR and as he showed
no improvement in the next several days he was eventually made
CMO and extubated on [**7-21**].

<br> HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM:
<br> Altered Mental Status: Patient's mental status rapidly
deteriorated in the MICU. During the first 2 days, he followed
commands, but became unresponsive thereafter. He did not open
his eyes, did not make purposeful movements, and did not
withdraw to pain. Work-up was significant for lymphocytosis on
CSF, two stable MRIs, 2 EEGs that showed no seizure activity,
and evoked potentials that showed some brainstem activity.  A
full panel of encephalitis and prion disease labs were sent.
Labs were negative for Bartonella, Lyme, Erlichiosis, HSV as
well as WNV, EEE, CJD. Also, CSF was sent to UPenn for
evaluation for anti-NMDA antibody encephalities and this was
negative (testicular U/S performed for associated testicular
malignancy in the setting of anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis was
also negative and AFP which can be elevated in this setting was
also negative). Neuro also recommended against brain bx, as
there was no focal lesion. He was sedated on propofol and
fentanyl and propofol was weaned several times to see if his
mental status had changed but he did not exhibit signs of
improvement.  Propofol was weaned on the day before he was
extubated and he still did not show signs of improvement in
mental status.

<br> Respiratory failure: Initially, patient's respiratory
failure was thought to be due to a combination of aspiration PNA
and flash pulmonary edema. With diuresis and broad spectum
coverage, his CXR improved and his leukocytosis and fevers
resolved. However, he was unweanable from the vent due to poor
mental status, blood pressure lability, and heavy sedation
requirements. It is thought that the underlying cause of Mr.
[**Known lastname 78543**] resp failure was neurologic dysfunction. Pt has a hx
of COPD, which was treated with standing albuterol and atrovent
nebs and a steroid taper, with minimal signs of improvement.
Patient's sputum did grow out Klebsiella on [**7-6**] and he was
initially treated with a course of vanc/cipro; cultures were
pan-sensitive and vanc was D/C.  Because repeat sputum on [**7-10**]
grew out GNR he was also started on cefipime, but the cultures
only showed minimal growth of pan-sensitive Klebsiella and
cefipime was D/C on [**7-13**].  Cipro was continued for a total of 10
days.  After the decision was made to extubate on [**7-21**], his PEEP
was weaned and he was kept sedated to a respiratory rate of
[**10-17**].

<br> Blood pressure lability: Pt presented to the MICU with
hypertensive urgency, which led to flash pulmonary edema. As his
mental status worsened, so did his hemodynamic instability. He
was consistently hypertensive to SBPs in the 190s and 200s when
sedation was weaned or when he was agitated. When comfortable
and on BP meds and full sedation, he dropped his SBPs into the
80s and 90s. Metoprolol was tried but this caused the patient to
drop his SBPs and was not continued.
He was maintained on low dose captopril to treat hypertension,
as well as using sedation (propofol) to maintain BPs at a normal
range.  Propofol was weaned several times to see if there was
change in mental status, and most times it was weaned he became
more hypertensive.

<br> Tremors: Pt started tremoring ~5 days into his MICU stay.
It begain with tongue fasciculations, spread to his entire right
side, then progressed to a full-body tremor. 2 EEGs were
performed during a heavily symptomatic (tremor) period and was
read as no seizure activity, but did show disorganized
background activity c/w toxic/metabolic/anoxic encephalopathy.
Tremors are caused by many of the viral encephilitidies and this
was thought to be the most likely cause of his tremor.

<br> Hypernatremia: Patient was initially hypernatremic at
presentation.  This was treated with free water boluses and
resolved.

<br> Hyponatremia: Patient was noted to be hyponatremic (129) on
[**7-13**] and free water boluses were D/C.  He was hyponatremic (130)
on [**7-15**] but a repeat sodium was 140 and this was thought to be
due to lab error.  Sodium was monitored and was within normal
limits after this time.
