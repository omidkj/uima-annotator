Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 759**]
Chief Complaint:
Respiratory Distress


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation


History of Present Illness:
HPI: 58 yo F with adult onset asthma (status several prior
intubations with prolonged wean), severe obstructive lung
disease (COPD, 2L home O2, no home steroids), obstructive sleep
apnea, who was found in respiratory distress satting 50% RA and
was intubated in the field on [**2162-1-24**].  Since that time, patient
has been at [**Hospital 1263**] Hospital.
.
At [**Name (NI) 1263**], pts ABG was 7.11/115/511 on AC at 100%FiO2.  The pt
remained intubated and was placed on IV Solumedrol, nebs, and
Levofloxacin.  She has been occasionally febrile to 100.4 and
was noted to have a vaginal and thick nasal discharge, both of
which were sent for culture.  EKG on admission was "abnormal"
with sinus tach and st depressions in lat and inf leads.  A
D-Dimer was also elevated at the time to 1162.  Patient was
ruled out by 2 negative sets of enzymes.  The team attempted to
extubate patient 1 day prior to transfer on [**1-27**] and removed the
#7 ET tube; patient struggled and was wheezy for a few hours,
and was re-intubated with a #8 ET tube.
.
On day of transfer, patient's family requested transfer to
[**Hospital1 18**].  Her RSBI prior to transfer was <100.  On TP her ABG was
7.41/74/74 on 40%FiO2 prior to transfer.  Her last ABG was
7.36/78/113 on AC/rr12/peep5/FIO2.5/ volumes 600. O2 was weaned
down to 40%.  Of note, throughout admission at [**Doctor Last Name 1263**] patient's
bicarb was elevated at 40, thought to be due to chronic
respiratory acidosis.


Past Medical History:

Pertinent Results:
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2162-1-28**] 9:29 PM

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)

Reason: please eval for infiltrate

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
58 year old woman with COPD, asthma, intubated for respiratory
failure
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
please eval for infiltrate
HISTORY: COPD and asthma, intubated for respiratory failure.

COMPARISON: [**2161-1-17**].

CHEST: AP semi-upright portable view. The endotracheal tube
terminates at least 2.5 cm above the carina. The nasogastric
tube is poorly visualized beyond the mid esophagus secondary to
technique, and it is not certain whether it reaches the stomach.
The lungs appear clear. There is no pulmonary edema or pleural
effusion. Cardiac and mediastinal contours are unchanged and
within normal limits.

IMPRESSION:
1. Satisfactory endotracheal tube position.
2. Suboptimally evaluated nasogastric tube position.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P:
58 yo F with reactive and severe obstructive lung dx (status
several prior intubations with prolonged wean and trach),(2L
home O2, no home steroids), obstructive sleep apnea, who was
found in hypoxic/hypercarbic respiratory distress.  The pt is
transferred from OSH after failure to wean from the vent, now
extubated and doing well on 6L NC.  In the MICU she was treated
as follows:
.
#Hypoxic Hypercarbic Resp. Distress: The patient has a history
of reactive airway disease with severe obstructive lung disease
and obstructive sleep apean.  She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] after
failure to wean from ventilator, this was thought to be
secondary to bronchospasm .  She was maintained on a ventilator
for one day after admission and was successfully weaned from the
ventilator without difficulty, she was continued on nebulizers
and a steroid taper.  She was empiracally started on
levofloxacin for a COPD exacerbation, to complete a 10 day
course.
.
Fever/Leukocytosis: Unclear etiology. Afebrile so far upon
transfer.  Elevated WBC likely due to steroids. Has borderline
dirty UA, probably covered by Levaquin, urine cx pending.
-F/u urine, blood, and sputum cultures

BV: Pt has had foul smelling vaginal discharge, and is being
treated with flagyl 500mg IV bid x 7 days (day [**2-16**])

HTN: continue lisinopril
.
DM: Pt has been on 70/30 in the past; keeping on SSI for now
--continue SSI, qid FS
.
Anemia: Pts baseline hct in [**2160**] was 38-40, hct now 34 with MCV
99-100.
--Iron studies c/w anemia of chronic disease
.
GERD: continue lansoprazole
.

==========================
Once called out to the floor, the patient did well.  She was
successfully weaned to her home O2 dose of 2L w/out problem and
maintained sats ~96% on this level.  She tolerated ambulation
w/out significant desaturations or subjective SOB.  She
continued on her levaquin and flagyl for a COPD flare and BV
respectively.  She also continued on steroids and was d/c home
on a steroid taper w/ close f/u with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and her PCP.
