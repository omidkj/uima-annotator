ABDOMEN U.S. (COMPLETE STUDY) Study Date of [**2173-3-27**] 8:07 AM
IMPRESSION:
1. Echogenic and coarsened liver are consistent with chronic
liver disease.
2. Thrombosis of the left portal vein; main and right portal
veins as well as splenic vein are patent.
3. Small ascites.
.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2173-3-26**] 4:39 PM
IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary process identified.
.
CT ABD [**2173-3-31**] :
1. Large complex mass centered at the gastroesophageal junction
with erosion into the gastric lumen.
2. Innumerable hepatic metastases.
3. Two 7-mm pulmonary nodules in the left lung are
indeterminate. One or both may represent a small focus of
infection, a benign nodule, or metastatic disease.
4. Severe coronary artery calcifications.
.
EGD on [**3-31**]: Mass in the gastroesophageal junction
Normal mucosa in the stomach
The duodenum was not entered due to the findings at the GE
junction. Biopsies were not taken due to elevated INR.
Otherwise normal EGD to pylorus.
.
EUS [**4-1**]: Mass in the gastroesophageal junction and cardia -
this was biopised. EUS of the mass could not be performed due to
constriction of esophageal lumen by tumor. EUS imaged of middle
and upper third of the esophagus were normal.


Brief Hospital Course:
56 yo male with PMHx of ETOH abuse, Afib on coumadin p/w anemia,
RVR, hypotension with h/o melena. New mass seen at GE junction &
e/o metastatic disease on CT scan. Biopsy results pending.
.
# GE junction mass/Anemia: Pt presented with hct drop and EGD
performed on [**3-31**] revealed a large polyploid mass at the GE
junction that was actively bleeding. Pt had a CT performed that
revealed a large complex mass centered at the gastroesophageal
junction with erosion into the gastric lumen and innumerable
hepatic metastases. Patient, family and PCP were explained the
results of these tests and biopsy was pending at time of
discharge.  Pt was eager to return home to family with plan for
outpatient follow up with GI Onc. Hct has been essentially
stable s/p transfusion with pRBCs but had trended down slightly
with multiple transfusions of FFP. Pt had developped antibodies
and blood bank was having difficulty finding an appropriate
match for transfusion. Hct was 26.8 on day of discharge and pt
agreed to have follow up labs drawn and followed up by his PCP
[**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**4-7**].
.
# Afib: Pt presented in A.Fib with RVR in setting of acute
anemia. Pt was initially rate controlled with IV lopressor and
admitted to the MICU where he remained hemodynamically stable on
po BB.  Pt was transferred to the floor and maintained good rate
control with Metoprolol. Coumadin was held on admission due to
GI bleed and supratherapeutic INR.  Pt received Vitamin K for 5
days & a total of 7u FFP to correct his INR for EUS & biopsy.
Pt was explained the risk of bleeding on Coumadin given his poor
synthetic function and the ongoing bleeding seen in the
esophageal mass.  Pt was instructed to stop taking Coumadin and
discuss this with his PCP in follow up.
.
# Cholestatic jaundice: Pt was noted to have a significant
cholestasis with only mild transaminitis. CT abdomen revealed
innumerable mets in the diffusely enlarged liver.  The
overwhelming burden of metastases is likely causing cholestasis
& impaired synthetic function in setting of underlying ETOH
cirrhosis.  Pt was started on Ursodiol 300mg [**Hospital1 **] to help with
pruritis and biopsy was taken of esophageal mass.  Biopsy
results were pending at time of discharge and pt was scheduled
to follow up with GI onc as outpt.
.
# Chronic CHF: Pt has a significant CAD history s/p NSTEMI and
ETOH abuse likely contributing to cardiomyopathy & EF 30%. Pt
maintained his sats well on RA without any evidence of volume
overload on exam. Pt was continued on Metoprolol and Lisinopril
5mg daily.  Pt was instructed to continue taking Lasix prn as he
was doing prior to admission.
.
# Leukocytosis: Pt was noted to have low grade fevers and
significant leukocytosis on admission. ROS was negative and all
blood/urine Cx were NGTD, CXR showed no evidence of infiltrate.
 CT scan showed large esophageal mass and it was thought likely
that the leukocystosis was due his primary malignancy.
.
# ETOH abuse: Pt was a heavy drinker and now reports
significantly less intake, currently drinking [**12-23**] glasses of
wine or beer per day. Pt reports that last drink was 3 days PTA.
 Pt was monitored on CIWA for five days without any ativan
requirements.  Pt was given folate, thiamine, MIV daily and was
counseled on the importance of complete cessation of alcohol
intake.  Social work was consulted.
.
# Hypothyroidism: TSH was in normal range and pt was continue
home regimen of Levothyroxine 25mcg daily.
