HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 37 year old
gentleman with a history of end stage AIDS complicated by
multiple opportunistic infections and long history of
cardiomyopathy of unclear etiology who had been managed for
several weeks as an outpatient with increasing episodes of
diarrhea and a weight loss of approximately ten pounds.

Approximately ten days prior to admission, he had also begun
to develop some shortness of breath associated with some
chest tightness and coughing.  He had been seen in the
Emergency Department where a CT angiogram of his chest had
been performed and revealed a pneumonia and he was treated
over the next week with Augmentin for this.  However, he
continued to have pleuritic chest pain, shortness of breath
and temperature of 102.

On follow-up office visit to his primary care physician, [**Name10 (NameIs) **]
was found to have collapse of the right middle lobe on chest
x-ray.  Given his ongoing pulmonary complaints as well as
diarrhea and poor nutritional status, he was admitted to the
hospital for further workup.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  HIV complicated by end stage AIDS first diagnosed [**2142**],

pancreatitis and complicated by peripheral neuropathy.

ALLERGIES:  Bactrim which leads to an aseptic meningitis.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives in an apartment with his
girlfriend and has visiting nurses once a week.  He is a
current smoker of one pack per week, occasional alcohol and
denies any intravenous drug use.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Unremarkable.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission, temperature was 98.1,
pulse 70, blood pressure 118/80, respiratory rate 18, oxygen
saturation 97% in room air.  Weight is 64.7 kilograms.  On
examination, he was awake, alert and oriented, thin and
comfortable in no acute distress. On head, eyes, ears, nose
and throat examination, the pupils are equal, round, and
reactive to light and accommodation.  Extraocular movements
are intact.  Moist mucous membranes.  He had thrush in his
oropharynx.  The neck was supple with lymphadenopathy and no
masses.  His lung examination revealed decreased breath
sounds at the right base with a few scattered crackles and
otherwise clear.  His cardiovascular examination revealed a
regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 and S2 with no murmurs,
rubs or gallops appreciated.  The abdomen was soft,
nontender, nondistended with positive bowel sounds.  Spleen
tip was palpable.  Extremity examination revealed a palpable
cord over the left medial thigh which was nontender.  He had
no edema and had 2+ pulses.

LABORATORY DATA:  Sodium 142, potassium 4.1, chloride 102,
bicarbonate 23, blood urea nitrogen 25, creatinine 1.1,
glucose 97.  Calcium 9.2, magnesium 1.9, phosphorus 3.4.
White count 4.2, hematocrit 49.9, platelets 206,000.  INR
2.6.  Partial thromboplastin time 33.7.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the Medical
Service for workup of pneumonia and diarrhea and was treated
for a number of complications throughout his hospitalization.

1.  Pulmonary - The patient had been treated as an outpatient
for approximately ten days with Augmentin for presumed right
middle lobe pneumonia which had not been improving.  His
medical regimen at the time of admission included Augmentin,
Ciprofloxacin and Azithromycin.  During his stay, however, he
was found to have bilateral deep vein thrombosis and upon
reread of his CT concern was raised for potential pulmonary
embolism.

For this reason, he underwent a CT angiogram on [**2158-6-6**],
which revealed a large left pulmonary artery embolism as well
as possible right sided pulmonary emboli.  Given his likely
hypercoagulable state and evidence of thrombus despite
presumably therapeutic INR levels, both the pulmonary and
hematology teams were consulted to help guide his therapy.

Placement of an inferior vena caval filter was entertained
given his tenuous respiratory status, known bilateral deep
vein thrombosis and concern that subsequent deep vein
thrombosis could be fatal.  The issues were discussed with
the patient as well as among his attendings and it was felt
that a filter would likely present a nidus for infection as
well as further clot and was generally not worth the risks of
the procedure.

Instead, the patient was placed on Lovenox therapy given
presumed failure to Coumadin therapy although it was noted
that he may have required higher doses of Coumadin, i.e.,
levels greater than 3.5 in order to truly be anticoagulated
with Coumadin. He will, however, be discharged on Lovenox
therapy.

The hematology and pulmonary teams were also concerned about
the use of Epogen and whether a hematocrit of greater than
50.0 may be associated with high risk of thrombosis.  It was
decided to continue Epogen therapy with goal hematocrit to be
maintained less than 40.0.

Throughout his hospital stay, the patient continued to
require intermittent oxygen with saturation documented well
below 88.  For this reason, arrangements were made for him to
continue to receive oxygen therapy at home upon his
discharge.  He was also treated for presumed pneumonia with
Azithromycin and Ciprofloxacin to finish out fourteen day
courses.

2.  Cardiovascular = During his hospital stay, the patient
experienced acute episode of shortness of breath associated
with left sided chest pain.  Electrocardiogram was obtained
which showed significant ST elevations in the inferior leads,
and the patient was transported urgently to the
catheterization laboratory for presumed acute myocardial
infarction.  At catheterization, the patient was found to
have an occluded right coronary artery and received 99
millimeters of stents with good final result.

He subsequently underwent an echocardiogram which showed a
preserved ejection fraction of 50% although he continued to
have right ventricular hypertrophy, right ventricular
dilatation and severe global right ventricular hypokinesis as
a result of his inferior myocardial infarction.  He was also
noted to have a small atrial septal defect of unclear
significance.

He was placed on Aspirin and Plavix and slowly introduced to
an ace inhibitor as his blood pressure tolerated.

3.  Infectious disease - The patient has a long history of
HIV, now end stage AIDS and CD4 count of 2.  His course has
been complicated by multiple opportunistic infections as
detailed above.  During his course, he was treated for
presumed pneumonia which is felt to complicate his pulmonary
emboli.  He was otherwise continued on his extensive
outpatient antiretr
