Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Sulfa (Sulfonamides) / Cefoxitin

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1145**]
Chief Complaint:
VF arrest

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
-Cardiac catheterization revealing minimal coronary lesions
-ICD placement


History of Present Illness:
This is a 53 year old female with history of seasonal allergies
and sigmoidectomy for diverticulitis who presented to the ED
after an out of hospital VF cardiac arrest.  Per report, she was
at work at BU on the day of admission when she collapsed at
approximately 9:15am. A co-worker says that she was seated at
her desk typing and simply slumped over without an obvious
prodrome.  A co-worker started CPR and after the police arrived
on scene they continued CPR and shocked the patient once with an
AED.  When EMS arrived the patient was in VF and required a
total of four shocks before regaining pulse.  There was
approximately fifteen minutes between the time of collapse and
the time pulse was restored per the outside observers.  She was
hypotensive in the field and so was started on dopamine.  Due to
a difficult airway she could not be intubated in the field and
was ventilated with bag valve mask until arrival at the ED.

In the ED the patient was intubated with
etomidate/succinylcholine and after dopamine was stopped she
received amiodarone, ASA PR, and NaHCO3.  Her vitals at that
time were HR 88 and NSR, BP 122/59, RR 19, and O2 Sat of 99% on
100% bag valve mask. She proceeded immediately to the cath lab
where left heart cath showed minimal atherosclerotic disease
without thrombus but with catheter-induced spasm of the proximal
RCA.  Right heart catheterization showed elevated right and left
filling pressures.

Past Medical History:
- sigmoid diverticulitis s/p sigmoidectomy
- appendectomy
- seasonal allergies

Social History:
She does not drink or use alcohol.  She works for BU in
continuing education.  She denies illicit drug use.  She lives
in [**Location (un) **] with her husband.


Family History:
Her brother has hypertension and diabetes mellitus.  No known
family history of premature cardiac disease or sudden death.

COMMENTS:
  1. Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant
system
revealed no angiographically apparent flow-limiting coronary
artery
disease. The LMCA had minimal plaquing. The LAD was patent with
a large
D1 and D2. The distal LAD was tortuous. The LCX had a modest
sized AV
groove giving off tiny OMs and a modest sized high LPL.
Canulation of
the RCA induced vasospasm which was only partially reversed by
intracoronary nitroglycerin injection; mild ostial plaquing
could not be
differentiated from continued vasospasm under these
circumstances. The
RCA gave off a tortuous RPDA with a large RPL-1 and modestly
sized RPL2
and RPL3.
  2. Resting hemodynamics at entry revealed moderately elevated
left
ventricular filling pressures measured at 20 mmHg.
  3. Post-angiography hemodynamics showed mild-moderate
pulmonary
arterial hypertension at 50/233 mmHg. A moderate elevation of
right
atrial at 20 mmHg and capillary wedge pressure at 20 mmHg was
noted.
Cardiac index was high at 4.2 L/min/m2 (using an assumed oxygen
consumption). There was no oxymetric evidence of significant
intracardiac shunting.
  4. Left ventriculography was not performed.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Coronary arteries were free of angiographically-apparent
flow-limiting stenoses.
2. Moderate left and moderate-severe right ventricular diastolic
heart
failure.
3. Mild-moderate pulmonary arterial hypertension.
4. No oxymetric evidence of significant intracardiac shunting

[**9-2**] TTE:
The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. Left
ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There
is moderate to severe global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF
= 25 %). No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular
filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size
is normal. with moderate global free wall hypokinesis. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good
leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve
appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal.
There is no pericardial effusion.

Non-Contrast CT Head:
Technically limited study. No evidence for acute intracranial
process.

Cardiac MRI on [**2137-9-5**]: These results were pending at time of
discharge
Impression:
1. Mildly dilated left ventricular cavity size with normal
regional left
ventricular systolic function. The LVEF was normal at 63%. The
effective
forward LVEF was normal at 57%. No CMR evidence of prior
myocardial
scarring/infarction.
2. Normal right ventricular cavity size and systolic function.
The RVEF was
normal at 66%. No CMR evidence of right ventricular fatty
infiltration/dysplasia.
3. Mild mitral regurgitation. No significant aortic, pulmonic,
or tricuspid
regurgitation.
4. The indexed diameters of the ascending and descending
thoracic aorta were
normal. The main pulmonary artery diameter index was normal.
5. Small right pleural effusion
