History of Present Illness:
72 year old male with unceratin PMH presents after being found
unresponsive and not breathing at home. Family reported that
patient had been wheezing for the past few days. He saw his PCP
and was given ?abx and inhalers, had CXR on [**10-31**] with extensive
chronic changes with nodular interstitial changes but nothing
acutely seen. He had been heard wheezing in bed this a.m. as
early as 7:30a.m. on morning of admission. Sometime between 8
and 8:30 a.m., he was found by family to be unresponsive, blue,
and not breathing but still warm. EMS was called. He was found
to be in either asystolic or PEA arrest, intubated in field and
coded. He got atropine x 2, Epi x 2 and was brought to [**Hospital1 18**] ED
where he receivd more epi/atropine, levoflox, flagyl, 1 amp
calcium gluconate, 10 u insulin, 1 amp D50 and ASA 325 x 1.  He
received CPR both in transport and in the ED. EKG showed diffuse
ST depressions. Given this he was emergently cathed. On arrival
in the cath lab, he was again pulseless and coded. Cath with PA
saturations in the 90's with high PCWP but clean coronaries;
this was likely due to a failure of peripheral/mitochondrial
ability to extract oxygen.  He was on levophed and epinephrine
and intermittently dropping his blood pressures to 50's,
requiring frequent boluses of epinephrine.

At transfer to the ICU, the patient was unresponsive, difficult
to ventilate, in shock, and anuric.  He continued to have
episodes of hypotension requiring boluses of epi every 10 mins.
A subclavin line placed for additional access.

Imaging:
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2142-11-2**] 12:25 PM
IMPRESSION:

1) Repositioning of endotracheal tube, now in standard position;
however, the cuff is likely over distended.

2) Swan-Ganz catheter tip overlies lateral aspect of right hilar
pulmonary artery.

3) Questionable evolving bilateral upper lobe opacities
superimposed upon changes of prior granulomatous infection.
These findings may be due to acute aspiration, infectious
pneumonia including reactivation TB, or asymmetrical edema.
Findings communicated to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 11180**] by telephone on [**11-2**], [**2141**].

Cardiology Report C.CATH Study Date of [**2142-11-2**]
COMMENTS:
1. Selective coronary angiography of this left dominant system
revealed
no angiographically apparent coronary artery disease. The LMCA,
LAD,
LCX, and RCA were all patent with only minimal disease.
2. Resting hemodynamics demonstrated elevated right and left
sided
pressures (mean RA pressure was 33mmHg, mean PCWP was 36mmHg).
There was
severe pulmonary hypertension (mean PAP was 53mmHg). The cardiac
index
was elevated at 7.4 L/min/m2. No significant gradient across the
aortic
valve was noted up on pullback of the pigtail catheter from the
left
ventricle.
3.  Echocardiography in the lab revealed normal ventricular
function
and no signiicant valvular disease and no pericardial effusion
or
evidence of intracardiac shunt.
4. Severe systemic hypotension to 50 mm Hg systolic responding
to
boluses of epinephrine.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Coronary arteries are normal.
2. Non-cardiogenic shock.
.
Cardiology Report ECHO Study Date of [**2142-11-2**]
Conclusions:
At the beginning of this study, left an right ventricular
contractile function
appeared normal to hyperdynamic. At the end of ther study,
during hypotension,
with high dose epinephrine, there was at least moderate global
biventriculart
hypokinesis. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no
mitral valve prolapse. There is moderate pulmonary artery
systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2142-11-3**] 11:03 PM
IMPRESSION:
1. Swan-Ganz catheter from inferior approach with distal tip in
right ventricle. This finding was relayed in a preliminary
report to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4281**] at 11:45 p.m. on [**2142-11-3**] by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
2. There is scarring in the right apex and laterally in the left
upper lung. There may be increased density in the left apex,
which may be indicative of a developing pneumonia. Correlate
clinically.
.
Neurophysiology Report EEG Study Date of [**2142-11-6**]
IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal EEG due to the extremely severe
encephalopathy. No electrographic activity of cerebral origin
was
noted. The usual EEG parameters for brain death protocol were
utilized.


Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was a 72 yr old male who was admitted after being
found down for an unknown period of time, with full
cardiopulmonary arrest.

He required very aggressive hemodynamic and ventilatory support
during his first days in the ICU.  Once his shock had
stabilized, formal testing revealed brain death.  The clinical
examination was confirmed at different times by three
physicians.  An apnea test was confirmatory.  An EEG revealed no
cortical activity.
