Service: NEUROLOGY

Allergies:
No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5018**]
Chief Complaint:
slurred speech and L sided weakness

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
cerebral angiogram and intra-arterial tPA/MERCI

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 35055**] is a 87 yo W with h/o AF who presents with slurred
speech and L sided weakness on rounds this morning.
The patient was admitted for dyspnea presumably due to
pneumonia.
She was hydrated and then developed increased respiratory
distress early this morning. CXR showed CHF, and she responded
to
Lasix. She was last seen at 4am, when RN gave her meds, which
she
took without difficulty. At 8am, intern rounding noticed
severely
slurred speech and not moving L side, so called code stroke.
Upon arrival, patient had eyes closed but was arousable and
interactive. She had L hemiparesis and facial droop, and
dysarthria. Eyes were deviated to the right. There was no
convulsive activity noted by RN or at time of exam. No
incontinence.
Head CT showed hyperdense R MCA, and CTA showed cut off around R
M2 segment. CT perfusion showed increased MTT and also decreased
blood volume in the inferior greater than superior R MCA
territory. Patient was then taken for intervention. On cerebral
angiogram, R MCA appeared to have opened sponataneously.

Of note, she had been switched from coumadin to dabigatran last
month. She took this new med for a couple of weeks then had
massive epistaxis and presented to the ED. For unclear reasons,
dabigatran was stopped at the time of her ED visit (5 days prior
to stroke) and coumadin was not restarted either.


Past Medical History:
1) Atrial fibrillation (on coumadin for appr. 10 yrs, stopped 1
week ago)
2) Mitral regurgitation with normal ejection fraction
3) Gout
4) Ventral hernia s/p repair ([**2122-9-10**]) with subsequent
exploration of wound and vacuum-assisted closure device
placement for cellulitis ([**2122-10-22**])
5) Hx of diverticulosis s/p low anterior resection with omental
flap on [**2121-1-17**]
6) Prior venous ulcers s/p stripping  of  bilateral long
saphenous venous system and split-thickness skin grafting to
ulcers ([**2118-1-17**])


Social History:
Lives in [**Location (un) 55**] in an apartment by herself, uses a walker
or cane to perform her ADLs.  Has two daughters, one living in
the area, and two grandchildren.  She denies any tobacco or EtOH
use.


Family History:
Uncles with diabetes mellitus, father's family with stomach
cancer.


Physical Exam:
ADMSSION EXAM:
Eyes closed, open on command. PERRL 4 to 2mm. Eyes deviated to
the right, moves to midline but not cross midline on dolls eyes.
No nystagmus. Follows midline and R side commands.
Oriented to self, age. Speech severely dysarthric.
Naming intact, repetition intact, comprehension intact.
L facial droop. Tongue midline.
L side 0/5, withdraws purposefully to pain. R side antigravity.

DISCHARGE EXAM:
Awake, alert and interactive. Naming, repetition and
comprehension intact. L neglect.
L dense hemiparesis, hypereflexia and upgoing toe.

IMAGING:
HEAD CT/CTA/CTP: Occluded right middle cerebral artery M1
segment. Large area of likely acute ischemia within the right
middle cerebral artery territory, with limited ischemic
penumbra.

NONCONTRAST HEAD CT (24 HR)
Evolving superior division right middle cerebral artery
territory
infarct, without hemorrhagic transformation at this time.

ECHOCARDIOGRAM
The left atrium is mildly dilated. No thrombus/mass is seen in
the body of the left atrium. The right atrium is moderately
dilated. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal
cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). No
masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. There is no
ventricular septal defect. The right ventricular cavity is
mildly dilated with normal free wall contractility. The
diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are
normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but
aortic stenosis is not present. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. No mass or
vegetation is seen on the mitral valve. Moderate (2+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is
seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.


Brief Hospital Course:
87 yo W with h/o AF not currently anticoagulated p/w dyspnea
then had acute R MCA stroke.

STROKE:
Patient was found to have dysarthria and L sided weakness the
morning following admission. Code stroke was immediately called.
Neurologic examination c/w gaze deviation to the right, with L
hemiparesis (face/arm/leg) and dysarthria, otherwise language
intact. STAT CT head showed R MCA infarct, with perfusion scans
already indicating increased MTT and reduced blood volume. CTA
showed cut-off at M2 segment
There is some calcification in the carotids but no occulsive
disease, and the most likely etiology remains cardioembolism
from atrial fibrillation in setting of stopped anticoagulation.
INR was subtherapeutic. She was outside the window for IV t-[**MD Number(3) 35056**] time of onset could not be reliably established, but was
still a good
candidate for intervention given the lack of changes on
noncontrast CT and the proposed mechanism. She was taken to
angio, where cerebral angiogram of R carotid showed R MCA was
already partially open, the clot had partially resolved
spontaneously but flow was not normal. IA tPA was given, with
some increased perfusion but incomplete recanulation of R MCA.
Later in ICU, pt was able to wiggle L toe.

Patient was admitted to the neuro ICU. She ruled out for MI. She
was monitored for 24 hours with stable neuro exams and stable
noncontrast head CT. She was transferred to floor.
She was restarted on coumadin with aspirin bridge given concern
for hemorrhage risk. She did not recover significant movement of
her left side.
INR at discharge was 2.2, and ASA should be continued for 1
additional day then stopped.

PT/OT recommended acute rehab. Speech/swallow recommended nectar
thick/purees, she was intermittently able to take thin liquids
but did cough/sputter at times. She should be re-evaluated at
rehab facility for this.

HTN:
Home antihypertensives were held and BP remained normotensive.
She can follow up about restarting these meds at her stroke
follow up appt.

PNA:
Patient had PNA on admission and received levaquin. She was
stable on nasal canula and nebulizers. She will complete a 10
day course of levaquin on [**12-23**].
Please repeat CXR in 2 weeks.

CHF:
Patient had CHF on CXR on admission, and received intermittent
Lasix. She was also restarted on home dose lasix daily.

CODE: Patient was full code, confirmed with daughter.
