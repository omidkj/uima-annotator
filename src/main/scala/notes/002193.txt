The patient is a 55-year-old Hispanic female that is mostly
Spanish-speaking who is a smoker who is transferred from the
outside hospital for respiratory failure.  The patient
originally presented with one week of dry, nonproductive
cough, high fevers and chills and productive shortness of
breath.  She was admitted to the outside hospital on [**2191-1-9**]
with reportedly influenza A positivity.  The patient
developed hypoxia, hypercapnia and respiratory failure with
bilateral infiltrates noted on chest x-ray with the
accompaniment of orthopnea, diffuse wheezing and tachypnea. .
The patient was subsequently intubated on [**2191-1-11**].  She then
became hypertensive with cephalic blood pressures 140s/210s
and developed oliguric acute renal failure at the outside
hospital.  The patient was started on broad spectrum
antibiotics including Vancomycin, Levaquin, Amantadine,
Fluconazole, bronchodilators and Lasix.  She was diuresed,
managed on antibiotics and then transferred to the [**Hospital1 1444**] [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] on [**1-15**] for further
management.

The patient was managed in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], extubated on [**2191-1-19**] and
transferred to the Floor on [**2191-1-21**].  Upon her transfer to
the Medicine Floor, the patient denied any chest pain,
shortness of breath, nausea, vomiting, emesis, fevers or
chills.  She had no breathing problems and stated that she
was breathing comfortably.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Otherwise significant for
hyperlipidemia and history of cervical cancer greater than 10
years ago status post total abdominal hysterectomy and
chemotherapy.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 98.9, blood pressure
136/70, heart rate 74, respiratory rate 18, satting at 94% on
6 liters by nasal cannula.  The patient's exam, generally she
is a middle-aged female sitting in a chair in no acute
distress.  The skin is clean, dry and intact.  HEENT is
normocephalic, atraumatic, extraocular movements are intact.
Oropharynx is clear with moist mucous membranes.  Neck is
supple with no jugular venous distention.  Heart is regular
rate and rhythm with no murmurs, rubs or gallops, normal S1,
S2.  Lungs are clear with minimal expiratory bases diffusely
and no crackles noted.  Abdomen is soft, nontender with
normal active bowel sounds.  Extremities:  Without clubbing,
cyanosis or edema, 2+ pedal pulses.  Neuro exam:  Cranial
nerves II through XII are intact.  Strength is [**4-27**] and
symmetric.  Toes are downgoing.  Reflexes are symmetric
throughout.  The patient is alert and oriented times 3.  She
is conversant, answers questions appropriately in Spanish,
follows two step commands.

DATA ON TRANSFER:  White count is 26.5 from a high of 32.7,
hematocrit is 27.3 and platelet count is 641.  Her chem 10 is
as follows:  Sodium 143, potassium 4.4, chloride 105,
bicarbonate 30, BUN 36, creatinine 1.2 (1.2 is the patient's
baseline creatinine), glucose 137, calcium is 8.3, magnesium
is 2.2 and phosphate is 3.7.

Abdominal ultrasound is significant for gallbladder sludge
with no evidence of cholecystitis and otherwise exam is
within normal limits.  Micro:  Blood cultures from [**1-16**], 1/29
times four, no growth to date.  C. difficile is negative
times two.

HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM:
1.  Respiratory failure:  Likely consistent with underlying
previously undiagnosed chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
which was exacerbated by influenza, infection.  The patient
had a negative CTA at the outside hospital.  The patient was
continued on Levofloxacin for atypical community-acquired
pneumonia as well as Amantadine and Vancomycin which was
discontinued on [**1-18**].  The patient was initially continued on
IV Solu-Medrol for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
exacerbation which was started on [**1-15**].  This was changed to
prednisone at 60 mg, one po qd. . The patient was to continue
a very slow prednisone taper outpatient otherwise patient
continued on nebulizer MDIs and by date of discharge, the
patient was free of nebulizer use and was maintained on MDIs.
The patient quit smoking approximately three weeks prior to
admission and was able to abstain throughout her hospital
admission without the need for a nicotine patch.

2.  Infectious Disease:  The patient had a urinary tract
infection which was resistant to E. coli with sensitivity to
Cephalosporin and Nitrofurantoin.  The patient was not given
Nitrofurantoin given that her creatinine clearance was less
than 60.

The patient had a negative penicillin skin test on [**2191-1-17**]
and was started on Ceftriaxone.  The patient also had
leukocytosis which was trending down by the date of discharge
and returned to a low of 23.3 and this was felt secondary to
steroid use.  The patient received her last dose of
Ceftriaxone to complete a seven day course prior to
discharge.  The patient's stool remained negative for C. diff
times two.  Blood cultures remained no growth to date by date
of discharge.  The patient was maintained on contact
precautions secondary to resistant urinary tract infection.

3.  Elevated alkaline phosphatase and GGT:  The patient has a
very benign abdominal exam.  It is felt that this is related
likely to acute illness or medications including Ceftriaxone.
The patient's abdominal exam was consistent with gallbladder
sludge with evidence of cholecystitis and otherwise exam was
within normal limits and reassuring.  Her liver function
tests trended down by date of discharge and should be fold
outpatient to insure they are solving to normal.

4.  Renal:  Acute renal failure again felt secondary to ATN
secondary to dye at the outside hospital or AIN due to
previous medications including Azithromycin, Fluconazole and
gentamicin.  The patient's creatinine remains stable at 1.2.
The patient had very good urine output upon discontinuation
of Foley catheter.

5.  Mental status:  The patient was previously agitated,
possibly secondary to ICU/steroid psychosis infection or
foreign-language barrier.  She was resistant to help and
Ativan prn however by the time of transfer to Medicine, the
patient was very calm, was alert and oriented times 3,
conversant and entirely appropriate.

6.  Cardiovascular:  The patient was diuresed initially
secondary to fluid overload and echo down to 126 was within
normal limits with an ejection fraction of greater than 60%,
no evidence of regurgitation, no other valvular abnormalities
and no evidence of wall motion abnormality noted.  The
patient's lung remained clear.  The fluid goal for her was to
remain euvolemic which she did throughout her
hospitalization.  By the time of discharge, the patient was
satting 96% to 98% on room air with no evidence of fluid
overload.  Her lungs remained clear.  She had no jugular
venous distention.

7.  Anemia:  The patient's iron studies in the past have been
consistent with anemia of chronic discharge but her iron and
TIBC are also less than 100%.  Her hematocrit throughout her
hospitalization remained stable and increased from 27.3 to
30.3.

8.  History of deep venous thromboses:  Lower extremity
Dopplers were negative.  CT Scan was negative at the outside
hospital.  The patient was maintained on subcutaneous Heparin
5000 units q 8 hours.

9.  FEN:  The patient was advanced from clears to cardiac
diet.  She was Reglan initially but tolerated a regular diet
without use of Reglan.  Additionally her hyperglycemia is
secondary to steroid use.  The patient was continued on a
Regular insulin sliding scale.  Her blood sugars ranged from
130s to 190s.
