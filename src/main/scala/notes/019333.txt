Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 134**]
Chief Complaint:
dyspnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
cardiac catheterization

History of Present Illness:
This is a 70 gentleman with history of CABG with LIMA-LAD in
[**2125**], AVR([**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Male First Name (un) 923**]), severe mitral stenosis who was admitted to
CCU for acute anterior MI and cardiogenic shock. He has been
complaining of shortness of breath for the poast few weeks. This
was thought to be related to mitral stenosis. On the night prior
to admission, he had severe SOB in bed with no chest pain. He
went to an OSH in congestive heart failure and hypoxic. He was
also tachycardic to 200 and given adenosine with HR in 150s. He
was then given ASA, heparin, IV NTG. Subsequently, he became
hypotensive to 90/60 and dopamine was started. He was intubated
for airway protection.
On arrival to [**Hospital1 18**] ED, he remains intubated. Echocardiogram
that was done at bedside demonstrated new anterior wall
hypokinesis. However, his INR was found to be 6.5. He was
transiently brought to the unit for reversal and then emergently
to the cath lab.

Past Medical History:
1. LIMA-LAD in [**2125**]
2. AVR(St. [**Male First Name (un) 923**])
3. MS
4. post-op AF
5. hypercholesterolemia
6. hypertension

Pertinent Results:
echo [**2126-4-11**]:
The left atrium is normal in size. Overall left ventricular
ejection fraction is severely depressed (20-30 percent); the
anterior septum, anterior free wall, and apex are severely
hypokinetic/akinetic. Right ventricular chamber size and free
wall motion are normal. A bileaflet aortic valve prosthesis is
present. The aortic prosthesis appears well seated, with normal
leaflet/disc motion and transvalvular gradients. The mitral
valve leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. There is no
mitral valve prolapse. There is moderate thickening of the
mitral valve chordae. There is moderate mitral stenosis, with
markedly elevated mean pressure gradient across the mitral valve
(heart rate is 132 beats per minute). Mitral regurgitation is
present but cannot be quantified. There is moderate pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

cath result [**4-12**]:
1. Selective angigraphy of the LIMA showed it to be widely
patent with
no angiographically apparent disease. Left subclavian
angiography
showed it to be widely patent without apparent disease.

CXR [**2126-4-11**]:
Single AP view of the chest dated [**2126-4-11**] at 10:12 a.m. is
compared with a
single AP view of the chest dated [**2126-4-11**] at 8:46 a.m. An
endotracheal tube
has been placed and terminates 3 cm above the carina. Previously
identified
congestive heart failure has slightly worsened in the last 1.5
hours. No
discrete infiltrates are identified. There is no pneumothorax.

Brief Hospital Course:
70 gentleman with history of CABG with LIMA-LAD in [**2125**], AVR([**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]
[**Male First Name (un) 923**]), severe mitral stenosis who was admitted to CCU for acute
anterolateral MI and cardiogenic shock.Patient presented with
pulmonary edema and hypotensive requiring intubation and
dopamine drip. This is compatible with cardiogenic shock,
differential being ischemia vs sudden decompensation of mitral
stenosis. However, echocardiogram showed acute anterior wall HK,
new decreased EF and unchanged MS, suggesting ischemia.Sepsis
workup was negative. Cardiac catheterization [**2126-4-11**]: cypher to
LMCA and prox LAD, kissing ballon to LAD and LCx. IABP not
placed since iliac angiography showed diffusely small iliac and
femoral vessels. He remained on pressors after the procedure and
hemodynamics were monitored by swan. He was extubated and off
pressors on the second day. He continued on integrillin for 18 h
and plavix for 9 months. He was discharged on aspirin, lipitor,
ACE and metoprolol. Coumadin was also continued for history of
atrial fibrillation and mechanical valve.
