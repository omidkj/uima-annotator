Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 898**]
Chief Complaint:
abdominal pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
83F with hx of DM, CAD s/p CABG, CRI s/p recent admission for
urosepsis admitted [**1-6**] with mild left sided abd pain,
non-bloody emesis and bloody stool. Anoscopy showed hemorrhoids
and dried blood in vault and NG lavage was negative. An abd CT
showed wall thickening beginning in transverse colon and
extending throughout remainder of colon as well as evidence of
recurrent diverticulitis in the rectosigmoid. Given lactate 2.3,
sbp 90s, T 100.7 in ED MUST protocol was initiated. RIJ placed
and she received 7L NS in ED. Se was transiently on Levophed.
She received flagyl/cefepime/vanco for presumed colitis and
possible pneumonia given LLL infiltrate on CXR. She was briefly
on the SICU service, but was transferred to the MICU service on
the same day for further management. While in the MICU, she
received additional 4L NS and 1u PRBC for HCT 25. Given she
remains hemodynamically stable, she is being transferred to the
general medical service for further management.

Brief Hospital Course:
A: 83F with hx of CAD s/p CABG, CRF, DM admitted with abdominal
pain, BRBPR found to have extensive colitis (infectious vs
ischemic) and recurrent rectosigmoid diverticulitis.

1) Abdominal pain/BRBPR: This was most likely related to known
diverticulitis/colitis. Distal colitis was most likely secondary
to infectious etiologies. Ischemic colitis was felt to be less
likely, despite the patient's known cardiovascular disease,
given the distribution of inflammation on CT. Surgery was
consulted, who do not feel surgical intervention was required.
There was no indication for urgent colonoscopy, given acute
colitis/diverticulitis. The patient will require a colonoscopy
as an outpatient, once her acute illness has resolved. Her
abdominal exam was closely monitored, and remained benign at
time of discharge. Her diarrhea resolved prior to discharge.
Her hematocrit remained stable at 29 following transfusion 1
unit of PRBC in the ICU prior to transfer to the floor. E. coli,
Campylobactor, Salmonella, Shigella stool cultures were
negative. C. diff toxin was negative X 1 (unable to produce
additional stool samples), and C. diff toxin B assay was pending
at time of discharge. She was continued on
levofloxacin/metronidazole and will complete a 10 day course for
presumed infectious colitis. Her diet was advanced, and, at time
of discharge, she was tolerating a regular diet. If her diarrhea
resumes following completion of antibiotics, stool samples
should be obtained for C. diff testing.

2) Pneumonia: LLL/lingular infiltrate noted on CXR following
admission. This may have been related to aspiration in the
setting of nausea/vomiting prior to admission, although this may
also have represented a community-acquired pneumonia. As
mentioned above, she was continued on levofloxacin/metronidazole
and will complete a 10 day course, which will cover both
aspiration pneumonia and infectious colitis.

3) Blood loss anemia: The patient's hematocrit remained stable
at 29 following 1u PRBC transfusion [**1-7**] a.m. [**12-19**] iron studies
were not consistent with iron deficiency and vit B12/folate were
not deficient. The patient's hematocrit should be monitored as
an outpatient to ensure stability and, as mentioned above, she
will need an outpatient colonoscopy once her
diverticulitis/colitis has resolved

4) Hypotension: The patient's hypotension on admission was most
likely secondary to  volume depletion given it rapidly
normalized with IV fluid resuscitation. Random cortisol obtain
in the ICU was 47, not suggestive of adrenal insufficiency. At
the time of discharge, the patient's blood pressure remained
stable on anti-hypertensives (required increase of lisinopril to
10 mg daily).

5) Acute on chronic renal failure: Creatinine improved to 0.9
from 2.2 on admission with hydration. The acute renal failure
was most likely related to volume depletion/dehydration in
setting of colitis, although the differential diagnosis includes
ATN in setting of hypotension.

6) Coronary artery disease: Initially held ASA in the setting of
GI bleed, however this was resumed at discharge. Her statin was
continued throughout hospital stay, and ACE inhibitor and
beta-blocker were resumed once she was hemodynamically stable.
There were no ischemic changes on EKG to suggest active
myocardial ischemia.

7) h/o congestive heart failure (EF20%): The patient was
euvolemic at time of discharge, and had been restarted on ACE
inhibitor and furosemide. Her fluid status will need to be
closely monitored as an outpatient to ensure stability, and she
should follow-up with cardiology as an outpatient at the
discretion of her PCP.

8) Type II diabetes: Her glyburide was intially held given poor
PO intake, however this, along with her home dose of 70/30 was
resumed at time of discharge

9) Stroke induced seizures: The patient was continued on her
home dose of Valproic acid.
