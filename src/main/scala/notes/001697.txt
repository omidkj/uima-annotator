Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4654**]
Chief Complaint:
acute shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none


History of Present Illness:
Ms [**Known lastname 4610**] is a [**Age over 90 **] year old woman with a medical history
significant for hypertension and a series of orthopedic
surgeries, but without a known CHF or CAD diagnosis, who comes
today with a two day history of feeling increasingly fatigued
and short of breath.

Starting on Thursday she noticed increasing cough and shortness
of breath. Thursday night ([**1-20**]) she had a difficult time
sleeping because of severe cough; she required three pillows to
decrease her cough and dyspnea. Today she also had a headache
and had mild nausea. She denies any chest pain or chest
tightness or palpitations. This evening, she used her emergency
alert button to summon 911 to bring her to the hospital today
after her shortness of breath worsened to the point of
intolerability.

She says she has been requiring more pillows to sleep on for
about the last month. On reflection she later also realized that
she has been having periodic sweats for about six weeks; however
she has taken her temperature during a number of these episodes
and generally finds it to be in the 96-97 range??????i.e., generally
lower than expected rather than febrile.

She??????s had no recent travel. As part of her past occupation as a
medical social worker she has often been tested for TB and her
last PPD was 1.5 years ago, which was negative. She has two cats
at home, but no other pets; no children at home. Her partner has
been sick for the last week or so, with a cough and what Ms
[**Known lastname 4610**] feels was likely a pneumonia, to which her partner is
often susceptible. Both Ms [**Known lastname 4610**] and her partner got flu
vaccinations this year.

In the ED her vitals were: 101.8 , 127, 173/74, RR 31, 100% on
NRB She received:Nitro drip; 80 mg Lasix x1; 325 mg ASA; 1 gm
ceftriaxone; 750 mg IV levofloxacin; 650 mg Tylenol; morphine 1
mg x2.

On arrival in the MICU her vitals were T 99.6, HR 101, BP
127/64, RR 26, O2 sat 96% on BiPAP FiO2 40%, PEEP 5.

STUDIES:
[**2157-1-25**] Echocardiogram:
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. There is moderate to severe global left ventricular
hypokinesis with more severe hypokinesis of the septum and
inferior wall (LVEF = 25-30 %). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests
an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
Transmitral Doppler and tissue velocity imaging are consistent
with Grade III/IV (severe) LV diastolic dysfunction. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
are mildly thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests a
restrictive filling abnormality, with elevated left atrial
pressure. There is no pericardial effusion

[**2157-1-22**] CT CHEST:
Patchy opacities in the lingula and right lower lobe which given

associated bronchiectatic change and may represent aspiration vs
pneumonia. Ground-glass opacity in a similar distribution as
well as the right upper lobe is nonspecific, however, can be
seen with bronchioalveolar carcinoma and thus recommend
three-six month followup to ensure resolution/stability.

[**2157-1-21**] CXR:  Evidence of mild fluid overload. No pleural
effusion or overt cardiomegaly.

[**2157-1-21**] EKG: Sinus tachycardia with left bundle-branch block.
No previous tracing available for comparison.


Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 4610**] is a highly functioning [**Age over 90 **] year old woman PMH
hypertension admitted fatigue and dyspnea found to have
community acquired pneumonia.

1. Community acquired pneumonia: Multifocal pneumonia on CT scan
with infilrate in RUL, RLL and lingula with 23% bandemia. This
is most likely cause of presenting symptoms of dyspnea and
respiratory distress.  In the emergency department she was felt
to have pulmonary edema clinically and on chest xray and was
briefly on BIPAP and treated with lasix.  In addition she had a
BNP of 4648.  She was admitted to the ICU given her requirement
for BIPAP which was quickly weaned and she was transferred to
the medical floor the following day.  She ruled out for
influenza with nasal aspirate.  In addition, she ruled out for
myocardial infarction with cardiac enzymes x3.  She was treated
with levaquin and improved clinically and was discharged to
complete a 7 day course.  She will need a repeat CT scan in [**4-8**]
months to ensure resolution of her infiltrates.  On discharge
she had an ambulatory oxygen saturation of 96%.

2. Acute on chronic heart failure: She had two episodes during
her admission with hypoxia, diffuse crackles and dyspnea which
improved with lasix and nebulizers consistent with pulmonary
edema.  No chest pain or EKG changes at the time. Possible flash
pulm edema.  Echocardiogram showed systolic dysfunction with an
EF of 25-30% thought likely to hypertensive vs ischemic
