Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 72 yo woman with PMH of CAD s/p CABG, chronic
diastolic CHF, OSA on home BIPAP, DM Type II, HTN, COPD on home
O2 who presented with a fall, dizziness, neck stiffness, and
fever.

# Community Acquired Pneumonia/Sinusitus:  On admission the pt
was febrile to 101.2 with WBC count of 13.3. Urine culture
negative, blood cultures negative at time of discharge. The
patient had a severe productive cough without any visible
infiltrates on CXR, but stable pleural effussion and
cardiomegaly. The pt received meningitis doses of ceftriaxone in
the ER as well as levoquin and flagyl for aspiration PNA. LP was
attempted in the ED, but was unsuccessful. Further LP attempts
were not taken as the patients neck pain is chronic in nature.
In the ICU, the patient had [**Month/Day/Year **] cough, but no hemodynamic
unstability, meningismus or altered mental status. Since
suspected meningitis  was low, patient was only continued on
Ceftriaxone/Azithromicin (started [**10-28**]) for bronchitis. She
also was noted to have acute maxillary sinusitus on head CT.
Patient did not require steroids for COPD flair. Blood cultures
and urine cultures were negative. She will be transitioned to
Levofloxacin upon discharge to complete a 7 day course (she will
need 4 more days of antibiotics).
.
# Dizziness/fall: The patient's fall was described more as lower
extremity weakness with the patient slumping to the ground. Her
lasix was held on admission, and her dizziness improved with the
administration of 500cc NS bolus on admition to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**]. On
hospital day 3, the patient was not orthostatic when evaluated
by PT and her lasix was resumed.
.
#Neck pain: Likely musculoskeletal vs. DJD changes. Patient
being followed by PCP for this reason. Suspect pt may have nerve
impingement in the C2 region based on her pain. Normal strenth
and slighlty diminished reflexes in upper and lower extremities.
CT C spine done on [**10-26**] as outpatient (ordered by PCP) which
showed degenerative changes and limited study due to cervical
positioning in lateral film. Pt cannot have MRI of her C spine
due to her ICD. Ultram was stopped due to pt sleepiness, and pt
was started on oxycodone 2.5 mg every 6 hours as needed as well
as neurontin 100 mg three times a day. She was also started on a
lidoderm patch and standing motrin (which will need to be
discontinued if renal function is unstable). If she has
increased somnolence or hypercarbia, these may need to be
discontinued. If she continues to have pain, consideration in
the future can be given to a steroid injection at a pain clinic
(for the cervical spine).
.
# Urinary Retention: The patient was noted to have post void
residual of 500 cc after 12 hrs of her foley being removed. Her
foley was replaced. Her ultram was discontinued as this was felt
to be contributing. She will need to have voiding trials at
rehab. Again, the oxycodone she is being started on may also
cause difficulty with urinary retention.
.
# COPD/OSA: Pt was at her baseline CO2 on ABG. She was noted to
often remove her BIPAP intermittently at night, and was very
sleepy during the day. Settings: 14/10 with 2.5-3L NC at home.
Her home regimen was continued with tiotropium and albuterol.
The patient should follow up with a sleep clinic for further
evaluation of her BIPAP settings (given her somnolence)to make
sure they are optimized. Consideration in the future can be
given to a stimulant (ie ritalin) if her CHF tolerates and her
psychiatrist is agreeable.
.
#CAD:  She was continued on her asa and statin. Her metoprolol
was restarted HD#2. Per her PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] did not tolerate ACE in past
with hyperkalemia and cough.
.
# Chronic diastolic CHF: EF 50-60%. BNP 482. Mild edema on CXR.
Lasix was restarted on HD#3. She appears euvolemic at this time.
.
# DMII, controlled, no complications: The patients oral
hypoglycemics were held in house initially, but were restarted
when her fingersticks were up to the 300s. She was treated with
insulin sliding scale in house.
.
#HTN:  Treated with her metoprolol.
.
# Hypothyroidism: Continued levothyroxine
.
# Schizophrenia: continued aripiprazole, depakote, and risperdal
.
