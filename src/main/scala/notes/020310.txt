Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1148**]
Chief Complaint:
abdominal pain and shortness of breath after elective
colonoscopy

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
colonoscopy
blood transfusions

History of Present Illness:
63 yo F hx COPD (2L O2 at home), CAD who was admitted on [**5-7**] for
elective polypectomy.  Experienced COPD exacerbation
post-colonoscopy. Her ASA, plavix were stopped 6 d ago.  Pt
developed a small amount of BRBPR after her colonoscopy, then at
about 4 PM, she had a large amount of BRBPR about 1L. She then
was noted to become tachycardiac to 110 and BP dropped to 50's.
Pt placed in T-[**Last Name (un) **] position, BP improved to 90s. Additional IV
access obtained, NS wide open and 2U PRBCs of emergency release
blood were initiated.
Pt transferred to ICU, where 2 additional 18 bore IV's placed
and pt received additional NS. BP on MICU arrival 110's,
improved to 150's with resuscitation at which point NS stopped.
HCT noted to have dropped 10 points since this AM. PRBCs
continued.
Pt notes increased abdominal pain especially when coughing and
increased distention. Pt mentating well throughout, and
extremities warm well perfused throughout.
Pt denies chest pain. Mild increase in SOB after agressive IVF.

No recent fevers, chills, stable O2 at home.

Pertinent Results:
[**2166-5-7**] COLONOSCOPY:
Findings: Protruding Lesions Three polyps were found in the
cecum, ascending colon and splenic flexure. The cecal polyp was
1 cm and sessile. The ascending colon polyp was 2 cm and
pedunculated. The splenic flexure polyp was 4 cm and
semi-pedunculated.
Other procedures: A single-piece polypectomy was performed using
a hot snare over a saline pillow in the cecum.
A single-piece polypectomy was performed using a hot snare in
the ascending colon.
A piece-meal polypectomy was performed using a hot snare in the
splenic flexure.
The polyps were completely removed.
SPOT injection was applied for tattooing with success in the
splenic flexure.

Impression: Three polyps were found in the cecum, ascending
colon and splenic flexure.
The cecal polyp was 1 cm and sessile.
The ascending colon polyp was 2 cm and pedunculated.
The splenic flexure polyp was 4 cm and semi-pedunculated.
A single-piece polypectomy was performed using a hot snare over
a saline pillow in the cecum.
A single-piece polypectomy was performed using a hot snare in
the ascending colon.
A piece-meal polypectomy was performed using a hot snare in the
splenic flexure.
The polyps were completely removed.
SPOT injection was applied for tattooing with success in the
splenic flexure.
.
[**2166-5-7**] CXR: Small right pleural effusion.
.
[**2166-5-7**] PORTABLE ABDOMEN: No evidence of obstruction or free air.
.
[**2166-5-7**] ECG: Sinus rhythm and frequent atrial ectopy. The QRS
morphology in leads V1-V2 again appear to be position related as
compared to the previous tracing  of [**2166-4-28**]. There is now
frequent atrial ectopy. Otherwise, no diagnostic interim change.

.
[**2166-5-8**] PORTABLE ABDOMEN: Significantly dilated loops of large
bowel for which CT can be performed for further evaluation if
clinically warranted.
.
[**2166-5-8**] CXR: Right pleural effusion, stable since day prior. No
consolidation.
.
[**2166-5-8**] ECG: Sinus tachycardia @ 125. Poor R wave progression.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2166-5-7**] the ventricular rate
is faster. Atrial premature beats are absent.
.
[**2166-5-9**] ECHO: No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color
Doppler. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Due to suboptimal
technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be
fully excluded. Left ventricular systolic function is
hyperdynamic (EF>75%). Right ventricular chamber size and free
wall motion are normal. The number of aortic valve leaflets
cannot be determined. There is no valvular aortic stenosis. The
increased transaortic gradient is likely related to high cardiac
output. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The estimated
pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. There is an anterior
space which most likely represents a fat pad.
.
[**2166-5-11**] CT ABD/PELVIS: Uncomplicated cecal bascule, observed with
180 rotation, but without obstruction. This appearance raises
the possibility that recent symptoms could related to transient
torsion of the bascule. No evidence of free air.
.
[**2166-5-11**] KUB: Markedly dilated loops of bowel are again
demonstrated, with large diagonally oriented loop of bowel
extending from the pelvis to the right side of the abdomen
measuring about 13 cm in diameter. This is similar in dimension
to the previous examination. Although possibly due to a colonic
ileus, the a volvulus or other cause of obstruction should be
considered, and further evaluation with CT may be considered as
previously recommended on [**2166-5-8**].
.
[**2166-5-12**] TRANSVAGINAL PELVIS U/S: 1. Fibroid uterus which contains
small fibroids in anterior and posterior fundus.

2. The endometrium measures 5 mm in thickness with no focal
lesion.

3. The ovaries were not visualized.

Brief Hospital Course:
1) Abdominal pain post polypectomy:  Patient initially admitted
for pain control post polypectomy.  This was believed secondary
to post polypectomy syndrome.  Given cipro/flagyl for total 14
days.  Pain improved.  Also had dilation of colon moderately
that improved prior to discharge.  CT scan abdomen/pelvis showed
cecal dilatation, with evidence of underlying cecal malrotation
and hypermobility (ie. abnormal fixation), which may result in
cecal "bascule" or volvulus.  This may place patient at higher
risk of volvulus or malrotation in the future.  No obstruction
seen.  Continue bowel regimen.  Recommend follow up colonoscopy
arraged in 6 months to eval polypectomy site.  Biopsies showed
adenoma.
.
2) GIB: Patient had lower GIB day after admission requring
transfusion 3U PRBCs and transfer to MICU.  Stabilized without
recurrence.  Patient to restart plavix/aspirin now at discharge.
.
3) COPD exacerbation: Worsened after procedure.  Initially
required higher oxygen levels that were then weaned back to home
2L NC.  Continued on nebs.  Discharge again with theophyline.
Steroids were increased initially and then tapered back down to
outpatinet regimen of prednisone 4mg [**Hospital1 **].
.
4) Menorrhagia: Patient had episode menorrhagia after not
receiving premarin for a few days.  Transvaginal ultrasound
revealed largest width of endometrium at 5mm.  Rec follow up as
outpatient and possible referral to gynecology for biopsy.
.
5) CAD/HTN: Continue ASA (held while here), statin.  BP meds
held around time of GIB.  Have discontinued nitro patch and
dyazide as BP well controlled without them.  Can consider
restarting as outpatient if needed.  No cardiac events while
here.
.
6) DM Type 2: Patient had lower insul
