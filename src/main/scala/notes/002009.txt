Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2181**]
Chief Complaint:
UGIB

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
EGD

History of Present Illness:
64 M with history of cirrhosis presumed due to EtOH, PUD s/p
past Billroth [**Hospital 40608**] transfer from [**Hospital3 **] with melena and
BRBPR.  Patient was admitted on [**2172-10-16**] with melena and BRBPR x
2 days.  Also associated with crampy abdominal pain and nausea.
Initial hematocrit 26.5, INR 1.8, developed thrombocytopenia to
60s as well.  Had EGD in ED which showed no varices, obvious
ulcers or tears.  Source thought to be "dusky" patch in stomach.
Stomach filled with blood and unable to visualize duodenum.  Per
HO report 6 units PRBCs given in addition to 2 units FFP (though
nursing reports 10 units PRBCs, FFP and platelets).  Per notes,
repeat EGD performed [**10-20**].  Bright red blood in gastric
reminant without ulceration seen.  Also appears to have had
bleeding scan performed with results unavailable currently.
Continued to have evidence of bleeding during hospital course;
HO reported cessation of bleeding and then restart, though not
clear from notes.  Patient has complained of epigastric area
abdominal pain, but nothing out of ordinary from usual chronic
abdominal pain.  Denies hematemesis.  No chest pain or shortness
of breath.  + occasional palps.  Denies abdominal
swelling/ascites.  Patient also with Afib with RVR (to 160) on
presentation requiring diltiazem gtt with eventual transition to
dilt PO and digoxin PO.  [**Hospital1 **] notes some hypotension (as low
as 84/50 seen in notes) but not requiring pressors at any time.


Sodium 157 today; D5W with K started.  Patient also noted to
have leukocytosis to 24K on [**10-19**], also with slight amylase
elevation, prompting CT (report not included with paperwork; per
HO was normal with ?no ascites; progress notes suggest "air
within thickened gastric remnant - air trapped in folds vs.
contained perforation").  Given zosyn due to leukocytosis and
?concern for bowel ischemia since admission.

IMAGING STUDIES:
ECHO [**2172-10-22**]: The left atrium is elongated. Due to suboptimal
technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be
fully excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
normal (LVEF>55%). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal left
ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse. The pulmonary artery systolic
pressure could not be determined. There is no pericardial
effusion. IMPRESSION: Normal global biventricular systolic
function. Limited study.
.
CXR [**2172-10-22**] AP SEMI-UPRIGHT CHEST: There is a right internal
jugular central venous catheter whose tip extends into the right
atrium. This could be pulled back approximately 3 cm for
placement in the cavoatrial junction if desired. The lungs are
hyperinflated. There is no evidence of pulmonary edema. The
thoracic aorta is tortuous. The heart is enlarged. The osseous
structures demonstrate bilateral abnormalities of the shoulders
and proximal humerus, nonspecific, possibly relating to
neuropathic joint or prior trauma. Please correlate with history
and consider dedicated plain films. In the upper abdomen, note
is made of multiple clips as well as a linear structure possibly
represents an IVC filter.
.
CXR [**2172-10-23**] Since yesterday, right internal jugular catheter
still ends in the very low right atrium, could be pulled back 5
cm to end in the cavoatrial junction. Tortuosity of the a
