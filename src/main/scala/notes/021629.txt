History of Present Illness:
Mrs. [**Known lastname **] is an 85 yo female s/p MV repair on [**2177-8-27**] who has
had multiple TIAs this year with 6 just since [**Month (only) 216**].  She had a
stroke in [**Month (only) **] that lasted for 12 hrs.  Most recent was Fri the
12th with L sided weakness/numbness that last 45 minutes.
Also in [**Month (only) 956**] she had PE and IVC filter. She has been on
coumadin for the pe and has had a stroke when her INR was
suprathrapeutic. She has undergone considerable work-up,
including echo. Echo revealed small mass (thrombus vs
vegetation). Blood cultures were negative.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] saw the
patient in [**Month (only) **] and determined that surgical risk
outweighed
benefit given her age and redo status.
She has subsequently been admitted to an outside hospital.  Echo
reveals an increase in size and complexity of the mass.  She
remains afebrile with negative blood cultures and no stigmata of
endocarditis.  She is transferred for surgical evaluation.

TEE
Pre-CPB: 1 The left atrium is moderately dilated. No spontaneous
echo contrast is seen in the body of the left atrium. The left
atrial appendage emptying velocity is depressed (<0.2m/s). No
thrombus is seen in the left atrial appendage.
2. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.

3. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal.
4. The ascending, transverse and descending thoracic aorta are
normal in diameter and free of atherosclerotic plaque. There are
simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
5. There are three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is no aortic valve
stenosis. Mild to moderate ([**1-25**]+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
6. A mitral valve annuloplasty ring is present. At least 2
vegetations seen on the anterior and posterior leaflets. There
is severe valvular mitral stenosis (area <1.0cm2). Due to
co-existing aortic regurgitation, the pressure half-time
estimate of mitral valve area may be an OVERestimation of true
mitral valve area. Mitral valve area was calculated at 0.8-0.9
cm2. There is moderate functional mitral stenosis (mean gradient
5 mmHg) due to mitral annular calcification. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen.
7. There is no pericardial effusion.
Drs. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and [**Name5 (PTitle) 7772**] were notified in person of the
results.
Post-CPB: On infusion of phenylephrine. AV pacing for prolonged
PR interval. Well seated bioprothetic valve in the mitral
postion. Small inferiolateral perivalvular leak. Small central
leak. Peak gradient 5 mmHg, mean gradient 4 mmHg at cardiac
output of 2.5. Preserved biventricular systolic function. AI and
TR remain [**1-25**]+. Aortic contour normal post-decannulation.

Radiology Report CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2179-11-23**] 9:48
AM
Final Report: Since the prior exam, the bilateral chest tubes
have been removed.  There are very small bilateral apical
pneumothoraces, slightly larger on the right than left.  The
right pneumothorax measures approximately 12 mm and the left
approximately 7 mm.  There is no evidence of tension.  Bibasilar
atelectasis is unchanged.  There is no definite pleural
effusion.  There is no pulmonary edema.  Severe cardiomegaly is
stable.  The mediastinal contours are unchanged.  Sternal wires
are intact.  Mediastinal clips are noted.
IMPRESSION:
1.  Small biapical pneumothoraces after chest tube removal.
2.  Stable bibasilar atelectasis.
3.  Stable severe cardiomegaly.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

DR. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]

Chest CT from [**11-23**]- per verbal report: no official reead at
this time.
Right upper lobe opacity measuring 16x2cm likely hematoma but
cannot be sure.
Substernal fluid collection measuring 6x2cm likely normal
post-op changes
Recommend: followup CT in 6 weeks


Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was transferred from outside hospital after several
TIA's. She had known mitral valve mass vs vegetation and was
preop for redo mitral valve replacement. She brought to the
operating room on [**11-16**] and underwent mitral valve replacement,
please see operative report for details in summary she had: Redo
sternotomy and redo mitral valve surgery with mitral valve
replacement with a [**Street Address(2) 17009**]. [**Hospital 923**] Medical Bicor Epic tissue
heart valve. Her bypass time was 80 minutes with a crossclamp
time of 61 minutes. Overall the patient tolerated the procedure
well and post-operatively was transferred to the CVICU intubated
on levophed and propofol. She initally had moderate amount of
bleeding and required products, she began to manifest tampanade
physiology, an echo was performed which confirmed tamponade. She
returned to the operating room for exploration and removal of
clot and correction of coagulopathy. See operative notes for
details. Once returning from the OR she was hemodynamically
stable and levophed infusion was weaned. She continue to have
moderate chest tube drainage and was given additional red blood
cells and platelets on
