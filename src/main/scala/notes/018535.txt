HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname 51497**] is a 61 year-old male
with a one year history of nonsmall cell lung cancer who was
transferred from an outside hospital to Cardiothoracic Surgery on
[**2145-9-30**].  The patient originally presented to the outside
hospital on [**9-18**] with nausea and vomiting and found to have
a small bowel obstruction.  A CT of the chest also revealed a
right sided pleural effusion as well as an obstructing right
upper lobe mass.  CT scan of the abdomen showed small bowel
obstruction secondary to diffuse abdominal metastases and the
patient underwent exploratory laparotomy with small bowel
resection on [**9-23**].  His postoperative course was complicated
by fevers and he was initially treated with Zosyn.  By report all
blood and urine cultures were negative.  The patient was then
transferred to [**Hospital1 69**] on [**9-30**]
for further management of the right upper lobe obstructing mass.
On admission the patient denies any chest pain, shortness of
breath or dizziness.  He did complain of a cough productive of
clear sputum.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Stage four nonsmall cell lung cancer diagnosed in [**2144-9-3**] status post chemo/radiation with metastases to the
abdomen.
2.  Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.
3.  Small bowel obstruction secondary to abdominal mets
status post small bowel resection.

MEDICATIONS AT HOME PRIOR TO HOSPITAL ADMISSION:  Prednisone
20 mg po q day started by the patient's primary care
physician for shortness of breath.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient was an electrician with the
[**State 350**] National Guard.  He retired last year.  He lives on
[**Location (un) **].  He has never been married and has no children.  The
patient has a 30 pack year cigarette smoking history.  He quit in
the [**2122**].  He drinks every once in a while and denies any
intravenous or recreational drug use.

FAMILY HISTORY:  The patient denies any family history of cancer.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON TRANSFER TO THE MEDICINE SERVICE:
Temperature max 98.9.  Current temperature 98.8.  Blood
pressure 145/84.  Heart rate 97.  Respiratory rate 20.
Oxygen saturation 98% on 1 liter nasal cannula.  In general,
the patient is awake, alert, appears his stated age and in no
acute distress.  He is cooperative with the examination, but
very grouchy.  HEENT examination pupils are round and
reactive to light.  Extraocular movements intact.  Sclera
anicteric.  Oropharynx is clear.  Neck is supple.  Chest
examination coarse breath sounds on the right greater then
left, no wheezing, no dullness to percussion with decreased
breath sounds at the right lung base.  Cardiovascular
examination regular rate and rhythm.  Abdominal examination
soft, nontender, nondistended with good bowel sounds.  A well
healing midline scar with mild erythema.  Extremities no
lower extremity edema.  Neurological examination alert and
oriented times three.  Cranial nerves II through XII grossly
intact.  Strength 5 out of 5 in the upper and lower
extremities.  Sensation intact to light touch in the upper
and lower extremities.

LABORATORIES ON TRANSFER FROM THE CARDIOTHORACIC SURGERY
SERVICE TO THE MEDICINE SERVICE:  White blood cell count is
4.4, hematocrit 26.4, platelets 399, creatinine 0.7, glucose
112.  Chest x-ray shows large medial right upper lobe mass
with opacification at the right heart border due to collapse
or consolidation of the right lower lobe.  There is an
irregular pleural thickening on the right apex as well as the
chest wall.  There is a hydropneumothorax at the right apex.
The left lung is clear with gross interstitial markings.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  1.  Lung cancer:  The patient was transferred
from an outside hospital following small bowel resection for
further management of the right upper lobe obstructing tumor. The
patient was initially admitted to the Thoracic Surgery Service.
Interventional pulmonary was consulted.  On [**10-1**]
interventional pulmonary performed a rigid bronchoscopy with
placement of the right upper lobe stent.  A chest tube was also
placed into the right chest wall for evacuation of the right
pleural effusion.  Steroids, which had been started at the
outside hospital were continued for the patient's wheezing and
dyspnea.  On [**10-4**] the chest tube was removed following
resolution of the pleural effusion.  The patient's steroids were
slowly tapered over the course of a week.  Zosyn had also been
started at the outside hospital for postoperative fever and the
patient was continued on Zosyn intravenously.  He was eventually
switched to Flagyl and Levofloxacin po and received a total of 18
days of antibiotics.  His postoperative fever was believed to be
due initially to postoperative pneumonia, however, the patient
continued to have low grade fevers to 100 despite antibiotics.
Multiple blood cultures and sputum cultures and urine cultures
were obtained, which were all negative. It was believed that the
continued fevers on antibiotics was possibly due to either tumor
fever or a drug reaction to the antibiotics.  Following stent
placement and chest tube removal the patient continued to have
intermittent shortness of breath and worsening cough and he was
taken by interventional pulmonary for a repeat bronchoscopy on
[**10-12**] for removal of mucous plug.  Following this
repeat bronch the patient symptomatically felt better, but
continued to require oxygen by nasal cannula at 2 liters.

Following discussion with the patient, interventional pulmonary
decided to attempt photodynamic therapy.  On [**10-8**] he
received his infusion of Photofrin followed by light treatment on
[**10-12**] and finally a bronchoscopy to clean out necrotic
tissue on [**10-13**].  The patient tolerated this procedure
well without any complications. Throughout the hospital course
the patient was continued on aggressive chest CT, incentive
spirometry, Albuterol nebulizers, Atrovent nebulizers and cough
syrup.  A physical therapy consult was obtained and they
determined that he would require outpatient chest physical
therapy as well as home oxygen therapy.  At the time of discharge
the patient's cough and shortness of breath had much improved and
he was arranged to follow up with outpatient chest physical
therapy.

2.  Fever:  The patient was transferred from an outside hospital
on Zosyn intravenously for postoperative fever.  It was believed
the cause of his fevers to be due to a post obstructive
pneumonia.  He was continued on Zosyn intravenously initially in
his hospital course and was eventually switched to po antibiotics
when the patient was tolerating po well.  He was started on
Flagyl and Levofloxacin to complete the total 18 day antibiotic
course. The patient continued to have low grade fevers to 100
despite these antibiotics.  Multiple blood cultures, urine
cultures and sputum cultures all returned negative.  It was
believed the cause of his continued fevers to be due to either
tumor fever or drug reaction.

3.  Atrial fibrillation:  The patient has a history of paroxysmal
atrial fibrillation, which was detected at the outside hospital.
At [**Hospital1 69**] the patient had one brief
10 second episode of what appeared to be atrial fibrillation. The
patient was asymptomatic during this episode.  The patient had no
further episodes of atrial fibrillation throughout the remainder
of the hospital course.

4.  Small bowel obstruction:  The patient had a small bowel
resection on [**9-23**] at the outside hospital for small bowel
obstruction due to lung metastases.  At the time of transfer the
patient was tolerating po and having bowel movements and he
continued to have [**Last Name **] problem throughout the remainder of his
hospital course.

5.  Diarrhea:  The patient complained of multiple loose bowel
movements - up to four bowel movements a day.  Multiple samples
were tested for C-diff all of which returned negative and the
patient's diarrhea eventually subsided.  No cause was found for
this diarrhea.
