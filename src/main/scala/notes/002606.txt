Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2297**]
Chief Complaint:
Melena, hematocrit drop

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
EGD
Tunneling of temporary HD line


History of Present Illness:
75 yo male with ESRD on HD, trach for resp failure who presents
from [**Hospital **] rehab with a hematocrit drop and melena in his
rectal tube. Per notes he had HD yesterday and received 2 units
PRBCS during HD and hct was 35 during HD. Today hct was
re-checked and was 19. Stools were noted to guaiac positive. INR
was noted to be 4.3 , so pt received 5 mg of vitamin K. VS at NH
were T 97.5 HR 104 BP 108/59 and sats of 98%.
.
In the ER he was noted to have melena in his rectal tube. Hs HR
was initialy in the 90s with BP 108/53. He had a lavage of his
g-tube that was clear and received protonix 40 IV x2. He
received an additional 5 mg of vitamin K and 2 units of FFP
here. He received ~1.5 L of fluid and had starte receiving 1
back of PRBCs prior to txfr to the ICU. While in the ER his SBPs
dropped to the 80s-90s.
.
Upon arrival to the floor, the pt's initial SBP was in the 70s,
with HR in the 120s. This improved to SBP of 90s. The pt
appeared comfortable and denied abdominal pain, chest pain,
lightheadedness or nausea. Said he had fevers several weeks ago
and one recent episode of emesis. He thinks he may have had
black stool for weeks.
.
Of note, pt recently admitted [**Date range (1) 77791**] for new atrial
fibrillation, septic shock (urosepsis), and acute on chronic
renal failure now requiring dialysis and was discharged to
[**Hospital1 **].

Baseline artifact. Probable atrial fibrillation with rapid
ventricular
response. However, there are periods of regularization but no
discernible
flutter waves. There is right bundle-branch block. Since the
previous tracing of [**2150-3-15**] the ventricular response is more
regular.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2150-4-2**]
Tracheostomy tube tip terminates about 9 cm above the carina,
and the cuff is overdistended, as communicated by telephone to
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on [**2150-4-2**]. Heart is enlarged, pulmonary
vascularity is engorged, and there is bilateral perihilar
haziness attributed to pulmonary edema. More confluent left
retrocardiac opacification is present, likely a combination of
atelectasis and moderate effusion, but underlying infectious
consolidation is not excluded. Small right pleural effusion is
also evident.
.
EGD [**2150-4-2**]
Impression: Internal bumper of the recently placed PEG tube was
seen in place. There was a blood clot underneath the bumper
suggesting a site of bleed. It was washed, and did not reveal
any visible vessel or active bleeding.
There was no fresh or old blood (except the clot under the
bumper) seen in the stomach.
There was no fresh or old blood in the duodenum.
Erythema in the first and 2nd part of the duodenum
Otherwise normal EGD to second part of the duodenum
Recommendations:
- Bleeding likely to be from the site of the internal bumper of
the PEG in the setting of high INR, but seems to have stopped
now.
- PPI [**Hospital1 **]
- Watch Hct

TTE (Complete) Done [**2150-4-4**]
The left atrium is moderately dilated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity is
moderately dilated. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal
wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%). The
aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. The ascending
aorta is mildly dilated. The number of aortic valve leaflets
cannot be determined. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately
thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary
artery systolic pressure could not be determined. There is no
pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: poor technical quality due to patient's body
habitus. Moderately dilated left ventricular cavity. Left
ventricular function is probably low-normal, a focal wall motion
abnormality cannot be fully excluded. The right ventricle is not
well seen. Thickened aortic leaflets without frank stenosis.
Pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.

RENAL U.S. PORT  [**2150-4-13**]
IMPRESSION: No hydronephrosis. No collections identified. Thin
cortex bilaterally consistent with chronic interstitial disease.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2150-4-17**]
FINDINGS: The image did not include the lung bases; however,
there is opacification in the right lung base secondary to
atelectasis and effusion. The left lung base cannot be
evaluated. The heart size is mildly enlarged and stable. More
opacification adjacent to the left heart border may indicate
left lower lobe atelectasis. A double-lumen central line tip is
in the proximal-to-mid one-third of the SVC. The tracheostomy
tube projects approximately 5 cm from the carina, unchanged.

Brief Hospital Course:
75 year old male with h/o ESRD on HD, tracheostomy who initally
presented with anemia and melena.  The patient was recently
discharged from [**Hospital1 18**] to rehab.  At rehab, he was found to have
a drop in his hematocrit from 35 to 18.6 associated with
hypotension and tachycardia.
.
# GI Bleed:  On admission, he had melena in his rectal tube and
gtube lavage was reportedly negative. His melena at that time
was felt most likely to LGIB, in the setting of recent
initiation of anticoagulation and supratherapeutic INR.  ASA and
coumadin were held on admission as well as his BB.  The patient
had a tagged red blood cell scan to identify the source of
bleeding, which was negative.  GI was consulted and performed
EGD on admission which demonstrated the source of bleeding to be
most likely from the site of the internal bumper of the PEG in
the setting of high INR, with no active bleeding noted.  Aspirin
and coumadin were held in the setting of active GI bleeding.  He
was transfused 8 units of PRBCs as well as 2 units of FFP on day
of admission, and his HCT remained stable above 30.  Although
his HCT remained stable, he continued to be guaiac positive.  He
was a second EGD on [**4-20**], which showed no source of bleeding.
His ASA and coumadin were restarted.

# Hypotension, Hemorrhagic, Hypovolemic and Septic:  Pt was
initially hypotensive, likely hemorrhagic [**1-17**] GI bleed.  With
