HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 61-year-old female
with end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis, diabetes type 2
controlled by diet with no medications.  She has got a
history of pituitary adenoma status post resection and
subsequent panhypopituitary syndrome.  She was brought in by
EMS to the Emergency Room with changes in mental status and
hypoglycemia, [**Year (4 digits) **] glucose 30.  The patient reportedly had
been difficult to arouse at home.

She has had diarrhea for the last two weeks and has no p.o.
intake in the last few days.  Her sister called EMS because
the patient was confused and slurring her speech.  On
arrival, EMS found that she had a [**Year (4 digits) **] glucose at 30 at 10
a.m.  After being given 1 amp of D50 and 100 mg of thiamine
IV, the patient's glucose rose to 80.  Her mental status
improved and she was taken to the hospital.  She denied
taking any medications for her diabetes.

In the ED, the patient complained of mild chest pressure with
nausea and vomiting.  Her [**Year (4 digits) **] glucose was measured at 47,
and the patient was hypothermic at 95 degrees and hypotensive
at 60 systolic.  She again responded to 100 mg of
hydrocortisone IV and ceftriaxone and Vancomycin empirically
for possible sepsis.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  She is currently living in an apartment with
her sister, 58 years old.  She is separated from her husband,
[**Name (NI) 26864**], and denies any EtOH, tobacco, or drugs.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Mother is [**Age over 90 **] years old with diabetes.  She
has diabetes all along that side of the family.

ALLERGIES:  She has no known allergies.

MEDICATIONS:
1. Lisinopril 10 mg p.o. q.d.
2. Atenolol 25 mg p.o. q.d.
3. Prednisone 5 mg p.o. b.i.d.
4. Tums 500 mg p.o. q.i.d.
5. Protonix 40 mg p.o. q.d.
6. Thiamine.
7. Folate.
8. Levoxyl 50 mg p.o. q.d.
9. Epo q dialysis.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. The patient has had several prior hospitalizations for
hypoglycemia; from [**6-8**] to [**6-10**], she was brought in
with a [**Month (only) **] glucose of 38 with diarrhea and nausea and
vomiting.  On [**4-23**]-30th, she had a [**Month (only) **] glucose of 28,
and was hospitalized, and even required bag ventilation.
2. Also another recent hospital admit is she was hospitalized
with coffee-ground emesis from an upper GI bleed on [**6-27**]
through [**6-29**].  She was scheduled for ERCP as an
outpatient, but later refused.
3. Panhypopituitary syndrome status post pituitary adenoma
resection.  The patient has had prior unstimulated a.m.
cortisol at 34.7, but was placed empirically on 5 mg q.d. of
prednisone.  She is currently also taking 50 mg q.d. of
Levoxyl for hypothyroid.
4. Diabetes diagnosed 20-30 years.  Since going on dialysis,
she has been diet controlled only.
5. Hemosiderosis diagnosed during abdominal MRI 05/[**2100**].
6. End-stage renal disease on hemodialysis Monday, Wednesday,
Friday.
7. Hypertension.
8. Severe coronary artery disease, ejection fraction of 30.
9. Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
10. H. pylori which is treated.
11. Pancreatic cyst that was discovered on [**7-16**] on
MRI.  The head of the pancreas contains a 1.8 cm nonenhancing
lesion of fluid signal intensity.  This may represent IPMT or
residua of prior pancreatitis.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On exam in the field, she was
sleeping, unarousable to sternal rub.  PERRLA.  She had a
positive doll's eye with flaccid tone.  She had vitals of
temperature 93-94.  [**Month (only) **] pressure 95-125/52-67, pulse of
75-83, respirations [**10-18**], and was 100% on room air.  In the
ED, she was a thin, lethargy, elderly female in no apparent
distress.  Her mucous membranes are mildly dry.  Her throat
was clear.  She had no lymphadenopathy and no jugular venous
distention.  She had a regular, rate, and rhythm, 3/6
systolic ejection murmur at the left lower sternal border
with a soft diastolic decrescendo murmur at the aortic valve
area.  Her chest showed bilateral crackles at the bases.  Her
abdomen was soft, nontender, nondistended with good bowel
sounds.  Her right upper extremity showed a thrill with an
A-V fistula with a bruit, and she also had 2+ pulses.  Her
neurologic exam was nonfocal.  Cranial nerves II through XII
intact.  Face symmetric.  Extraocular movements are intact.
Tongue midline.

LABORATORIES ON ADMISSION:  Her Chem-7 showed she had a
glucose of 47.  Patient had a CBC:  White [**Month/Year (2) **] cell count
5.1 to a 75.6 neutrophils.  She had a hematocrit of 35.4 and
platelets of 94.  She had a CK of 95 and a troponin which is
negative.

Her EKG showed a Mobitz I at 65 beats per minute with flat T
waves in V1 to V6.

Chest x-ray showed cardiomegaly with no infiltrate or
congestion.

Head CT showed no masses or bleeds.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Hypoglycemia:  The etiology differential
was insulinoma versus adrenal insufficiency versus renal
hypoglycemia, versus poor liver glycogen reserves, versus
accidental ingestion of diabetes medication.  The patient
denied taking any diabetes medications and her [**Month/Year (2) **] was
negative for sulfonylurea.

In order to address the possibility of insulinoma, the
patient was put on a prolonged glucose fast in which the
patient was made NPO, and her fingersticks were monitored
every four hours until she reached 60 after that one hour.
The test was discontinued either when the patient's [**Month/Year (2) **]
glucose reached less than 45 or when she is symptomatic.
Between 60 and 45 in the fingersticks, the patient's [**Month/Year (2) **]
drawn were levels of insulin, proinsulin, peptide C and beta
hydroxybutyrate.  The results were sent out and will be
reviewed by Endocrine.

Based upon the results of the fingersticks, which was a slow
progression of fingersticks 117 to 89 to 67 to 68 to 72 to
53, to 61 to 60 and then finally to 47, this is suggestive of
low glycogen reserves causing a hypoglycemia when the patient
does not eat enough.

On discharge, the patient was stable, and she was told to
increase her p.o. intake with frequent snacks such as peanut
butter with crackers before bed.  Patient's PCP was also
notified to contact Endocrine regarding the results of the
prolonged fast.

Regarding the patient's hemosiderosis, a Hematology consult
was ordered and they believe that based upon the results of
the iron study, which showed the patient was overloaded with
iron and the MRI at the patient's liver, kidneys, and spleen,
and bone marrow were full of iron, there was a strong
possibility of a iron storage disease as the etiology to the
patient's multiple medical problems.

They discussed the possibility of phlebotomy at hemodialysis
and the patient's nephrologist was notified of this
suggestion by Hematology.

As far as Endocrine, the patient's Levoxyl was increased to
75.

Neurology:  The patient has had several episodes of
nonresponsiveness in which not even sternal rub could wake
her up from sleep.  At the same time, while the patient was
on a monitor, everything was normal.  An EEG was done and it
was found that the patient had a marked metabolic
encephalopathy.  They recommended a sleep-deprived EEG with
sphenoidal electric nodes.  The patient was given the number
of Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], who is a neuro-endocrinologist for followup as
an outpatient of her EEG.

Regarding her hypotension upon admission, it normalized after
receiving IV fluids and glucose.

Regarding the patient's coronary artery disease, the patient
had an echocardiogram that was done.  It showed a profound
global hypokinesia with an ejection fraction of less than 20.
It had gotten worse over the last two years.  Based upon the
results of that, it is unlikely that simple atherosclerosis
is responsible for this.  The differential of amyloidosis and
hemachromatosis.

Regarding physical therapy, a consult was made.  The patient
was cleared by Physical Therapy for a safety evaluation at
home and also home physical therapy every morning after
breakfast several times a week.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1. Prednisone 5 mg one tablet p.o. q.d.
2. Docusate sodium 100 mg one ta
