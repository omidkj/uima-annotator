Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1835**]
Chief Complaint:
Thoracic spinal abscess



Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:

History of Present Illness:
70 yr old gentleman who was recently seen inpatient [**Hospital1 18**]
for thoracic abscess/discitis. He was in initially followed by
ID
at [**Hospital3 **] for several m months for MRSA sepsis and a right
pleural space infection. On [**12-17**] he fell on the right
after shoveling snow sustaining rib  fractures with a
hemothorax,
hypoxemia s/p chest tube placement. He developed high-grade
Staph
aureus bacteremia and infection of his right pleural space.
Pathogen oxacillin -resistant. His hospital course was
complicated by cardiac arrhythmia, NSTEMI, prolonged right
chest
drainage, depression and insomnia. He was on Vancomycin from
[**12-25**] through [**1-23**] via a PICC
line.  One week after stopping antibiotics he developed night
sweats and back pain was seen at [**Hospital3 2568**] and transferred to
[**Hospital1 18**] for neurosurgery evaluation. [**2146-2-21**]. He was ambulatory
and
did not have any bowel or bladder dysfunction. MRI [**2-21**] showed
T9-T10 diskitis,probable osteomyelitis and small fluid
collection, epidural abscess.  IR performed a biopsy on [**2146-2-22**]
Blood cultures and would culture grew MRSA sensitive to
vancomycin.  ESR a nd CRP elevated and imaging confirmed
osteomyelitis. PICC placed and patient dc'd on antibiotics  on
[**2146-3-1**]. Admitted for leg swelling, heart failure on [**5-7**].

Currently complains  of constant severe left sided pain that is
an [**7-7**] on a 0-10 scale.  There are no precipitating or
ameliorating factors. Of note,  he has lost 35 lbs since
[**Month (only) 404**].

On Discharge: Non focal

Pertinent Results:
[**2146-4-15**] CXR : There is no change in the elevation of the right
hemidiaphragm and basilar atelectasis.  There is a small right
effusion.  Pleural effusion has decreased in size.  A
curvilinear opacity in the right base is unchanged.  Exaggerated
kyphosis secondary lower thoracic wedge compression deformities
and partial vertebral body collapse is unchanged.  No Acute
cardiopulmonary process.

OR T-SPINE [**2146-4-16**]: IMPRESSION: Stabilization construct in lower
thoracic spine, in overall anatomic alignment on AP and lateral
views.

CXR [**2146-4-16**]: IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to [**4-15**]:
Left pleural tube impinges on the mediastinum in the midline at
the level of the carina.  Left hemithorax is hyperinflated and
the mediastinum may be shifted slightly to the right,
exaggerated by patient rotation, but the
interfaces projecting over the left lung laterally are skin
folds, not the
pleural edges of pneumothorax.  On the other hand, this is a
supine radiograph and anterior pneumothorax could be missed,
particularly since there is subcutaneous emphysema in the left
chest wall.  When the left pleural tube is repositioned,
recommend a right decubitus view of the left hemithorax to look
for pleural air.

ET tube is in standard placement.  Right jugular line ends in
the region of the superior cavoatrial junction, nasogastric tube
ends in the upper stomach and should be advanced 8 cm to move
all the side ports beyond the GE junction. Left PIC line passes
at least as far as the upper SVC, where it is partially obscured
by the jugular line.

ECHO [**2146-4-17**]: Conclusions
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF= 20-25
%). The right ventricular free wall thickness is normal. The
right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with severe global
free wall hypokinesis. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. Mild
(1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. Mild to moderate ([**11-29**]+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. There is no change in LV
or RV function from prior echo. The patient has a overall LVEF
of 20-25%, with regional wall motion abnormalities present in
the basal, mid, and apical septal and inferior walls as well as
the apex. The RV is mildly dilated with severe free wall
hypokinesis. Mild to moderate TR, mild-mod MR, and trace AI are
unchanged.

CXR [**2146-4-17**]: IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to 11:10 p.m. on [**4-16**]:
The left pleural tube still impinges on the mediastinum at the
level of the carina.  Skin folds project over the left lung in
the upperexpanded
hemithorax.  Subcutaneous emphysema is more pronounced.  To
assess
pneumothorax would require right decubitus chest films since the
patient
presumably cannot tolerate sitting erect.  Atelectasis in the
infrahilar right lung which preceded surgery is still severe.
Mediastinum is unremarkable, although possibly slightly
rightward shifted as before.  Nasogastric tube passes into the
stomach and out of view.  Right jugular line and left PIC line
are central.

CT TORSO [**2146-4-17**]: IMPRESSION:
1. Post operative changes in the form of T9 and T10 corpectomy
with interbody spacer and graft material and T8 to T11 fusion.
There is no evidence of hardware loosening or fracture.
2. Mild anterior epidural soft tissue at T9-T10 level causing
indentation of the thecal sac. Possibility of post operative
fluid collection or hematoma cannot be ruled out. Close
attention to this area on follow up imaging is advised.
3. Minimal retropulsion of the bony fragments at T9-T10 level
with associated ligamentum flavum calcification causing mild
narrowing of the thecal sac. This has improved since the prior
study.
4. Fractures of superior facets of T10 vertebra bilaterally
causing severe
bilateral foraminal stenosis.
5. Subacute fractures of posterior ends of right lower ribs.
6. Left sided hydropneumothorax with pleural effusion and basal
atelectasis on the right side.
7. Left renal calculi.

[**4-18**] ECG: Sinus rhythm with ventricular premature beats and
possibly
multifocal atrial tachycardia. Since the previous tracing atrial
and
ventricular arrhythmias are new. Clinical correlation is
suggested.

[**4-18**] CXR:  ET tube tip is 7 cm above the carina.  Thoracic
hardware is in place.  The NG tube tip is in the stomach.  Left
chest tube is in place.  There is mi
