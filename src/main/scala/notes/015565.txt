Brief Hospital Course:
#Group B strep bacteremia.  She was admitted with back pain and
tachypnea, with high O2 requirement.  On hospital day 2, she was
found to have Group B Streptococcus growing in her blood, pan
sensitive.  She was started on penicillin given pansensitivity.
She was seen by ID, and was evaluated for source of the
bacteremia, with a spinal MRI, abdominal pelvic CT which showed
no abscesses or evidence of osteomyelitis.  In addition, she had
a TTE which showed no evidence of endocarditis.  An HIV test and
IgG levels were recommended by ID, but she refused.  No clear
source of the bacteremia was identified.  She will receive a
total of 2 weeks of penicillin with home IV therapy.  She will
discuss HIV and immunoglobulin testing with her PCP.

#SIRS: The patient was admitted with severe hypoxia.  A chest
xray was unremarkable, and chest CT showed no evidence for PE,
but a possible infiltrate.  She was admitted to the ICU with
concern re: her tachypnea and high oxygen requirement.  She was
initially started on levofloxacin, vancomycin and ceftriaxone.
She improved with treatment of her pain, and this likely
reflected a systemic inflammatory response to her bacteremia.

# Back pain:  The patient had a MRI of her spine to evaluate for
the cause of the pain.  This showed intermittent cervical disk
bulges, but no evidence of other significant pathology.  It also
showed diffuse marrow enhancement, likely due to anemia or other
mild bone marrow suppressing process.  Her back pain was thought
to be musculoskeletal in nature.  She had PT and was ambulating
well without significant difficulty.

# Hypertension:  Her blood pressure remained in good control on
her home regimen.

# Anemia:  She was anemic on admission and persistently.  She
had no evidence of blood loss.  Anemia studies are pending.  She
also had the diffuse vertebral body enhancement seen on the
spinal CT which may need to be further evaluated if she remains
anemic, or has any other symptoms of malignancy.
