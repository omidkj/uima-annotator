Penicillins / Sulfa (Sulfonamide Antibiotics) / caffeine

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2265**]
Chief Complaint:
ASA desensitization

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
placement of DES in LAD with jailing of diagonal vessel

History of Present Illness:
65 year old female with no previous history of CAD, GERD, COPD
admitted to [**Hospital6 **] with chest pain, found to have
95-99% LAD bifurcating lesion, transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for
intervention and ASA desensitization.  Admitted earlier this
week to [**Hospital3 **] for chest pain with negative CT, negative
imaging stress test, and negative nuclear ETT.  Discharged
yesterday ([**10-1**])from [**Hospital3 **], but then brought in by
ambulance to [**Hospital3 **] with recurrent chest pain radiating to
her back and both arms, similar to the symptoms that prompted
her previous admission a few days earlier, CE's negative x 2.
Upon her first admission, she refused cardiac catheterization,
but underwent cath upon the second admission with the above
noted LAD lesion.  Transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for intervention with
necessity for ASA desensitization due to allergy.  Reported to
be chest pain free, with 5 French in RFA, distal pulses intact.
Loaded with 600 mg plavix and IV heparin/Integrillin. In the
cath lab, DES was placed in the proximal LAD, and is now in the
CCU for aspirin desensitization.
.
Pt denies any current chest pain/discomfort, shortness of
breath, or nausea. She reports back pain due to positioning
secondary to her "sciatica pain" that is starting to sit in her
abdomen.
.
On review of systems, she denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, black stools or red
stools. She denies recent fevers, chills or rigors. She denies
exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other review of
systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of paroxysmal
nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope
or presyncope.

Cath report:
1. Coronary angiography in this right dominant system
demonstrated 95%
proximal LAD stenosis involving the origin of a large D1 with
ostial 70%
stenosis. The LMCA, LCx, and RCA had no angiographically
apparent
disease.
2. Limited resting hemodynamics revealed mild systemic arterial
systolic
hypertension with SBP 164 mmHg.
3. Successful PCI of the LAD with 2.5x18mm Promus DES and
overlapping
3.0x8mm Promus post-dilated to 3.0mm distally and 3.25mm
proximally (see
PTCA comments).
4. Procedure complicated by transient closure and dissection of
D1,
which was successfully rescued (see PTCA comments).
5. Manual 8F RFA sheath pull.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. One vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Successful PCI of LAD with DES complicated by transient
closure and
dissection of D1 successfully rescued (see PTCA comments).
3. Plavix for minimum 12 months.
4. Aspirin desensitization immediately in CCU per protocol, and
then
continue indefinitely.
5. Integrillin to continue for 18 hours post-PCI.
6. Hydrate for prevention of contrast nephropathy.
7. Check cardiac enzymes and monitor clinical status closely.
8. Manual sheath pull when ACT<170s.

TTE
The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
and cavity size are normal. There is mild regional left
ventricular systolic dysfunction with akinesis of the mid to
distal septum and hypokinesis of the apex. Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial mitral
regurgitation is seen. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic
pressure is normal. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Normal left ventricular cavity size and wall
thickness with mild regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction as described above. No clinically significant
valvular disease. Normal pulmonary artery systolic pressure.
