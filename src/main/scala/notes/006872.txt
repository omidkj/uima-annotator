History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 71 year old male with a 30 pack-year smoking
history who had workup for some small volume hemoptysis that
started in [**2136-12-6**] and was found to have a 2.8 cm right
hilar mass seen on chest CT suspicious for
malignancy.  In addition, on the CT scan the tumor appeared to
encase the superior pulmonary vein and it was felt that the
patient would likely require a pneumonectomy.  His preoperative
staging showed no evidence of distant or nodal
disease and his pulmonary function tests were acceptable for
pneumonectomy.

[**2137-1-27**] CXR:
Status post right pneumonectomy with an increase in amount of
fluid
accumulating within a right-sided hydropneumothorax. There are
some scattered air-fluid levels within it suggesting pockets of
air and fluid within the mid and lower pleural space. A small
amount of air is seen within the chest wall and neck soft
tissues consistent with subcutaneous emphysema. The left lung is
well inflated and clear. The left heart border and left
mediastinal contours are stable. Overall, there is slightly less
mediastinal shift when compared to the previous study. No
evidence of pulmonary edema.



Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to the hospital and taken to the
Operating Room where he underwent a right thoracotomy and
pneumonectomy. (See formal Op note for details).  He tolerated
the procedure well and returned to the ICU in stable condition.
He maintained stable hemodynamics and his pain was well
controlled.

Following transfer to the SICU he continued to make progress.
He  underwent vigorous pulmonary toilet and was able to use his
incentive spirometer effectively.  His chest tube was removed on
post op day #1 and his right thoracotomy site was healing well.
His IV fluids were minimized and he was also diuresed post
operatively.  His renal function remained normal.

He was transferred to the Surgical floor and was ambulating
independently and eventually off of oxygen. His room air
saturation was 93-96% with ambulation. His appetite was modest
and generally he was feeling better daily.  His blood sugars
were in good control and his pain was relieved with oral
oxycodone and Tylenol.

After an uneventful recovery he was discharged to home on
[**2137-1-28**] and will follow up in the Thoracic Clinic in 2 weeks.
