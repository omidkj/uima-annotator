Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 87302**]
Chief Complaint:
 cellulitis


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
64 y.o female with primary peritoneal carcinoma last round of
Topotecan ending [**2155-7-1**], lung metastases, and recent right
humerus fracture with 2 recent admissions for
cellulitis/dehydration ([**Date range (1) 62150**]/[**2154**]) presenting with
hypotension, decreased p.o intake and mild dyspnea. Her symptoms
have been  gradually worsening over the past 2 days, immediately
post discharge.She endorses decreased p.o intake because she
gets "full very quickly." She also had 3-5 episodes of nausea
and bilious non bloody vomiting the last 2 days. These  symptoms
were associated with chills and slowed mentation. This afternoon
she was noticed by her family to be less responsive, confused
and have labored breathing. She was brought to the emergency
room for further evaluation.
.
Ms. [**Known lastname **] has had 2 recent admissions (discharged on [**2155-7-9**] and
[**2155-7-17**] from [**Hospital1 18**]) for cellulitis around her peritoneal catheter
site. During the first admission she was started on vancomycin
and discarged on this medication; however, when she was admitted
on [**2155-7-14**], her vanc level was 51.6 and this antibiotic was
discontinued. Patient was discharged on [**2155-7-17**] without
vancomycin.
Patient states that her symptoms of malaise, fatigue, and fever
have increased since her discharge on [**7-17**]. Her symptoms are
associated with chills and slowed mentation. On day of admission
she was found by her family to be less rsponsive, confused, and
with labored breating.

Initial vitals in the ED were: 102, 136 99/71 12 91% RA. Patient
was given Zosyn and Vancomycin, rectal tylenol. She had blood
and urine cultures sent. She was given 2 liters of fluid. A FAST
ultrasound revealed complete collapse of IVC consistent with
hypovolemic shock.

In the MICU patient was in no acute distress. She was given a
total of 8L of fluid over the course of about 24 hours. She was
initially started on azithromycin for atypical lung pathogens
(source of fever had not been entirely elucidated) but this was
stopped. A CXR showed "mediastinal contours are similar in
appearance with a bulging appearance, compatible with known
lymphadenopathy. There is ill definition of the vasculature,
bilateral effusions and bilateral lower lobe volume
loss/infiltrate. The overall impression is that of worsening
CHF. An underlying infectious infiltrate cannot be excluded." A
CT chest was done and is still pending.

On transfer from MICU vitals were: 104, 98/61, 97.9, 26, 98% on
2L NC. Patient was comfortable but with anasarca. Put out about
20-30cc of fluid in the last few hours. Upon arrial to 11R
vitals are: 97.2, 98/60, 95, 18, 95% on 2L. She is comfortable,
surrounded by her family. Alert and oriented. Complains of
banging in her right ear.

ROS: Positive for malaise, fatigue, constipation. Hears banging
in her right ear. Denies headache, chest pain, shortness of
breath, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, other other
concerning signs or symptoms.

Review of systems:
Obtained from patient
(+) Per HPI
(-) Denies  night sweats, recent weight loss or gain. Denies
headache, sinus tenderness, rhinorrhea or congestion. Denies
chest pain, chest pressure, palpitations, or weakness. Denies
nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, abdominal pain, or
changes in bowel habits. Denies dysuria, frequency, or urgency.
Denies arthralgias or myalgias.

PAST ONCOLOGIC HISTORY:
[**5-17**] Malignant ascites, extensive peritoneal disease, pleural
effusion and axillary nodes, papillary serous ca, stage IV. CA
[**Telephone/Fax (1) 102264**].
[**2152-6-15**] Carboplatin/taxol x 4
[**2152-8-29**] Expl lap, omentectomy, TAH/BSO, appendectomy with
radical debulking, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 102265**], with all visible disease
removed or separated from adjacent organs. Pathology showed
papillary serous adenocarcinoma involving omentum and
peritoneum. Tumor involved left ovary and tube as serosal and
surface adhesions, with no parenchymal involvement.
[**2152-9-18**] [**Doctor Last Name **]/taxol x 3. CA 125 5.
[**Date range (1) 102266**] No Chemo.
[**5-18**] CT torso: Stable pulm nodules, none new. Evidence of
recurrent disease as demonstrated by soft tissue thickening and
implants within the pelvis, as well as along the right paracolic
gutter, left upper quadrant, and perihepatic regions. New trace
ascites. Nodule along the wall of the gallbladder may represent
a focal peritoneal implant or gallbladder metastasis. CA125 156.
[**Date range (1) 102267**] Carboplatin/Doxil x 6.
[**2153-6-20**] Avastin added.
[**2153-9-3**] CT Torso: No evidence of residual tumor within the
peritoneal cavity. Interval resolution of the ascites and left
pleural effusion. No evidence of residual left axillary
adenopathy. 3 2-mm nonspecific pulmonary nodules. CA 125=7
[**2153-11-5**] Cycle #6 given without Avastin due to HTN, epistaxis.
[**2153-12-4**] CT Torso:
IMPRESSION: No interval change since [**2153-9-3**].
[**2153-12-11**] Avastin as monotherapy for maintenance - last dose
[**2154-4-3**]
[**2154-3-29**] CT Torso: (CA 125 rising) Mild thickening and narrowing
of the distal ileum which is likely due to contraction. Clinical
correlation is recommended. Otherwise, the study is essentially
unchanged since previous examination.
[**2154-5-20**] CT Torso: New recurrent free fluid in the pelvis. New
and enlarging mesenteric lymph nodes. The largest lymph node
measures 12 mm in the small bowel mesentery within the pelvis.
This was not demonstrated previously. Unchanged small bilateral
pulmonary nodules. CA125 = 359
[**7-19**] Evaluated at [**Hospital1 2025**] for clinical trial but patient declined
participation for fear of alopecia.
[**2154-7-31**] Started gemzar. Tolerated poorly after 3 doses.
[**2154-8-21**] CT Torso: Multiple lung nodules range in size from 2-6
mm in the right and left lung. The largest nodule, in the
lingula, is 6 mm. There is bilateral trace pleural effusion and
minimal basilar atelectasis. Thyroid gland is normal. In
addition to subcarinal 3.8 x 3 cm conglomerate lymph node mass,
enlarged lymph nodes are seen in the precarinal (15 mm), right
lower paratracheal (13.3 mm), left parasternal (12 mm), thoracic
inlet (14 mm right side) and right subclavicular regions (12
mm). Multiple other lymph nodes in the prevascular and
presternal region are less than 10 mm in short axis. Note is
made of diffuse smooth thickening of the lower esophageal wall.
The heart is normal size without pericardial effusion.
Atherosclerotic calcification in the left anterior descending
artery is mild. Abdomen/pelvis: Extensive peritoneal,
mesenteric, and omental metastases. Exam severely limited; no
acute process identified. 2. Sigmoid diverticula. The study and
the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.
[**2154-8-23**] Abd ultrasound showed ascites not extensive, too little
to tap.[**2154-8-27**] Cardiac echo done for dyspnea. The left atrium is
elongated. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color
Doppler. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and
regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%). There
is no ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size
and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+)
mitral r
