History of Present Illness:
This 56 year old gentleman has a history of coronary artery
disease and is status post myocardial infarction in [**2180**] and
[**2188**]. He has been experiencing chest pressure for the  past 2
months, intermittent, occurring at rest and associated with
shortness of breath, resolving without intervention.  He
developed chest tightness and shortness of breath on [**2190-3-22**]
which did not resolve and he called 911. He was admitted to
[**Hospital6 3105**] for further work-up. A cardiac
catheterization was obtained which revealed severe three vessel
coronary artery disease. Given the severity of his disease, he
was transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] for surgical management.

CXR
FINDINGS: In comparison with study of [**3-28**], there has been
placement of a
right IJ catheter that extends to the mid-to-lower portion of
the SVC.
Improved lung volumes with small bilateral pleural effusions.
Mild
indistinctness of pulmonary vessels suggests some increased
pulmonary venous
pressure and there are continued mild atelectatic changes.
Gastric dilatation
is not appreciated on the current study.

Echo
Findings
LEFT ATRIUM: Normal LA size.
RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: PFO is present.
LEFT VENTRICLE: Moderate symmetric LVH. Normal LV cavity size.
Normal regional LV systolic function. Overall normal LVEF
(>55%).
RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.
AORTA: Normal ascending, transverse and descending thoracic
aorta with no atherosclerotic plaque. Normal diameter of aorta
at the sinus, ascending and arch levels.
AORTIC VALVE: Normal aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS. No AR.
MITRAL VALVE: Normal mitral valve leaflets with trivial MR.
TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets with trivial
TR.
PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflet.
No PS. Physiologic PR.
PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.
GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify I was present in compliance with HCFA
regulations.
REGIONAL LEFT VENTRICULAR WALL MOTION:
Conclusions
PREBYPASS: The left atrium is normal in size. A patent foramen
ovale is present. There is moderate symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal.
Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
ascending, transverse and descending thoracic aorta are normal
in diameter and free of atherosclerotic plaque to 30 cm from the
incisors. The diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and
arch levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic
stenosis or aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve appears
structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is
no pericardial effusion. Normal diastolic funcition with E' =
8cm/sec. No clot in LAA. Normal coronary sinus. Essentially
normal exam with moderate LVH.
POSTBYPASS: UNCHANGED, Normal systolic funciton with LVEF > 55%,
no SWMA, no valvular abnormalities. No dissection seen after
aortic cannula removed. Good hemodynamics with no swma following
chest closure.

Brief Hospital Course:
Following transfer from an outside hospital for surgical
evaluation he underwent preoperative workup.  On [**3-26**] he was
brought to the Operating Room and underwent coronary artery
bypass graft surgery.  Please see the operative report for
further details.  Of note there was difficulty with catheter
placement and urology was consulted.  He underwent cystoscopy
with urethral dilation with Foley catheter placement by urology
in operating room. He received vancomycin and cefazolin for
perioperative antibiotics and gentamycin due to urethral
dilation.  He was transferred to the intensive care unit for
post operative management. Post operatively he was noted for
collapse of the right upper lobe on postoperstive radiogram and
with increased PEEP levels this reexpanded. His oxygen
saturation level were adequate, despite paO2 of 60s.
Preoperative PFTs demonstarted severly reduced FEV1 and DLCO.
His lungs were stiff in the Operating Room, consistent with his
100+ pack year smoking.  He was weaned from the ventilator on
POD 1 after diuresis.  Pulmonary toilet was aggressively persued
with diuresis.  He remained in the intensive care unit for
respiratory monitoring.  He was started on betablockers for
heart rate management.   Physical Therapy worked with him on
strength and mobility.  He was transferred to the floor on post
operative day three for the
