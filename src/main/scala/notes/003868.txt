Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1515**]
Chief Complaint:
NSTEMI transferred for cardiac catherization

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac Catherization [**2104-11-24**] with drug eluting stents to the
right coronary artery x1 and to the obtuse marginal artery x2.


History of Present Illness:
Pt is a 68 year old M with PMHx HTN, HLD, CAD s/p MI with 4
vessel CABG x4 at [**Hospital 4415**]. He presented to
[**Hospital6 3105**] with chest pain. He initially
presented to [**Hospital6 5016**] with SOB and chest tightness
in 9/[**2104**]. TTE at the time revealed mild TR, mildly elevated
[**Last Name (un) 6879**] 38 mmHg, LVEF 55% and stress test with nuclear imaging
showed abnormal myocardia perfusion with a fixed posterior
lateral defect, without evidence of ischemia or reversibility.
He was discharged but then later presented to Cardiologists
office on [**2104-10-6**] with intermittent chest pain, which did not
appear to be anginal in nature. Patient reports that he has been
having chest pain at night when he lays down in bed and that the
pain is relieved with Maalox. Given perfusion study only few
weeks prior his symptoms were thought to be GERD and he was
started on PPI. Patient returned to cardiologist for follow up
appointment when he was found to be hypertensive with CP c/w
angina. CP occuring with exertion, relieved at rest and
radiating to left arm.
.
Per discussion with patient, he denies ever having CP with
exertion and he is able to ambulate and do light work without
symptoms. He is adament that he only has chest pain when going
to bed at night laying down. The pain requires him to sit up and
maalox relieves symptoms. He describes the pain as pressure like
and also involving his back. He has never had N/V, diaphoresis
with these episodes. The pain is not radiating and is does not
change with position or with respirations.
.
Patient presented to LGH ED after referral from Cardiologist for
CP/SOB. EKG done in ED showed RBB, LAFB, Q waves in inteferior
lead c/w old MI. First topinin came back elevated at 6.29. At
that time he was given chewable aspirin, plavix, and started on
heparin drip. TSH was normal. Met panel was normal except for
AST of 50. CXR without acute process, Trop peaked at 7.17.
.
Cardiac Catherization (L wrist) was performed on [**2104-11-21**] which
showed LIMA to LAD patent, SVG to RCA with tight stenosis at the
ostium/graft and bifurcation (thought to be culprit lesion).
Patient had some chest pain at end of procedure, given 2 mg
morphine, 2 sprays of ntg with improvement in his symptoms. He
was transiently placed on a nitro drip for CP but this was
stopped prior to transfer.
.
Plan was transfer directly to [**Hospital1 18**] cath lab for intervention
today, however the patient was fed beef stew at around 1pm, so
he was transferred to [**Hospital Ward Name 121**] 3 directly. On transfer, patient off
nitro drip and vitals 104/58. Telemetry showed sinus rhythm with
1st degree/bundle hr 50s, 97%RA
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for current absence of
chest pain, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle
edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope. He does described
dyspnea with heavy exertion but denies SOB with light slow
walking (COPD has been an issue in terms of functional
limitations

MRSA SCREEN (Final [**2104-11-27**]):    No MRSA isolated.
.
IMAGING/STUDIES:
.
TTE [**2104-11-24**]:
The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. The
estimated right atrial pressure is 0-5 mmHg. Left ventricular
wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There is mild to
moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
hypokinesis of the inferior and inferolateral walls and near
akinesis of the mid lateral wall. The remaining segments
contract normally (LVEF = 40-45 %). Right ventricular chamber
size and free wall motion are normal. Right ventricular chamber
size is normal. The aortic arch is mildly dilated. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion and no aortic stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. There
is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be
determined. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Normal left ventricular cavity size with regional
systolic dysfunction c/w multivessel CAD. Mild mitral
regurgitation with normal valve morphology.
