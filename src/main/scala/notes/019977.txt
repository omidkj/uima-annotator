Brief Hospital Course:
Pt was admitted electively to hospital, went to OR where under
general anesthesia underwent cranioplasty.  He tolerated the
procedure well. Postoperatively, he had significant nausea and
vomiting and appeared to have some bile coming from his trach at
one point. Thus he was treated with compazine, phenergan,
ondansetron, and metoclopramide with eventual improvement in his
nausea. His Gtube was also left to gravity to avoid further
aspiration. On POD 1, he was transferred to the Stepdown Unit.
His tracheostomy was not changed to a cuffless at this point due
to continued nausea and concern for possible increased
aspiration risk. His laboratory values (Bun/Cr, trop) were
slightly elevated but EKG was WNL so he was given an IVF bolus.
 On POD 2, the patient reported decreased nausea and tube feeds
were restarted, but trach change was deferred at that point. He
was seen by medicine and it was recommended that pepcid be
changed to reglan, erythromycin for GI motility. Laboratory
values improved.
On POD#3 & 4 his nausea was again improved and he was
neurologically stable. Labs were normalized as well.
On POD#5 he denied nausea or emesis. He was seen by
interventional pulmonary and they decided to change his trach to
a #6 cuffless. After remaining stable post exchage he was
cleared to return to his rehab facility. He may be advanced to a
PMV 24 hours post trach change and to a redcap thereafter.
Please do not decanulate patient until he is seen by the
pulmonary team in 2 weeks.
