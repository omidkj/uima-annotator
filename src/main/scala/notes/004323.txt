Studies:
[**6-15**] Tib Fib & Ankle films: No acute fracture.
.
[**6-16**] Abd U/S: Evaluation of the right upper, right lower, left
upper and left lower quadrants of the abdomen demonstrated a
small amount of ascites in the right upper quadrant. The
quantity was not sufficient to mark a spot for paracentesis.
.
[**6-16**] CTA Chest: 1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism. No
consolidation within the lungs.
2. Old compression deformity of a mid thoracic vertebral body.
3. Nodular liver consistent with a cirrhotic liver, associated
small amount of ascites, and likely reactive lymph node at the
gastroesophageal junction.
4. Calcification along the right pectoralis major muscle is
suggestive of a prior hematoma in this region.
.
[**6-16**] CT Head: No evidence of intracranial hemorrhage. Likely old
small infarct in the right cerebellar hemisphere.
.
[**6-16**] CT Abd/Pelvis: 1. Cirrhosis with small amount of
perihepatic ascites tracking into the right paracolic gutter.
2. Extensive wall thickening of the ascending and transverse
colon indicating colitis of indeterminant etiology, possibly
secondary to liver failure.
3. No evidence of pancreatitis.
.
[**6-17**] Femoral Vascular U/S: Findings most consistent with AV
fistula at the site of the femoral puncture.
.
[**6-17**] CT Abd/Pelvis: 1. Fatty cirrhotic liver without enhancing
lesions identified. Perihepatic ascites.
2. Bilateral tiny pleural effusions.
.
[**6-20**] CXR: Left basilar opacity since [**2107-6-16**].
.
[**6-22**] CXR: Left lower lobe collapse, unchanged since [**6-20**],
accompanied by increasing moderate left pleural effusion. No
pneumothorax. Tip of the right PIC catheter projects over the
superior cavoatrial junction. No mediastinal widening. The right
lung clear. Mild cardiomegaly stable. Dilated azygos vein
suggests elevated central venous pressure or volume.
.
[**6-23**] RUQ U/S: 1. Nodular liver consistent with cirrhosis.
2. Moderate amount of ascites.

Brief Hospital Course:
# Abdominal pain: According to past records from [**Hospital1 18**] and from
[**Hospital1 2025**], the patient has a long history of admissions and ED visits
for abdominal pain, as well as a history of narcotic-seeking
behavior.  He has a history of HCV cirrhosis.  The differential
diagnosis of his pain was broad, and included pancreatitis
(although amylase, lipase, and CT findings argue against this),
SBP (paracentesis results were negative), colitis (some chronic
changes noted on CT, no change from prior), and gastritis.  The
patient did have an elevated bilirubin, but RUQ ultrasound was
unrevealing, other than his known cirrhosis.  Chronic mild
elevation of LFTs was felt to be secondary to HCV and EtOH.  The
patient was initially kept NPO and given IV fluids and PPI.  Due
to his somnolence on admission, narcotics were initially
avoided.  Later in the hospital course, the patient was given PO
opiates only, due to his hypercarbic respiratory failure (see
below).  The patient was very demanding and constantly requested
IV pain medications.  He also frequently refused all PO
medications. At time of discharge he was on tramadol po only and
is eating well without significant abdominal pain.  The patient
does claim to have a history of chronic pancreatitis as the
etiology of his pain, so to make a definitive diagnosis he could
be referred for a secretin test.  This can be consider as an
outpatient.
.
# Groin hematoma:  Following placement of a femoral venous
catheter for IV access, the patient developed a hematoma and
became hypotensive.  He was taken to the OR on [**6-18**] given
concern for an AVM.  No AVM was found, but a large hematoma was
evacuated.  A JP [**Month/Year (2) 19843**] was left in place, but on [**6-23**] the patient
pulled this out.  At that time the [**Month/Day (4) 19843**] had still been draining
600-700cc/day.  Serosanguinous fluid continued to [**Month/Day (4) 19843**] from the
site of the JP [**Last Name (LF) 19843**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] vascular surgery recommended placement
of an ostomy bag over the site to collect the fluid and monitor
its volume, as well as to protect the patient's skin.  The
patient's hematocrit remained stable.  Lasix was also restarted
in the hopes that treating the patient's peripheral edema would
help to prevent reaccumulation of fluid in the groin site.
(though albumin is quite low so this may not be successful) The
patient had apparently been on diuretics as an outpatient as
well, but adherence was not certain. Needs follow up with
vascular surgery.
.
#HCV/EtOH Cirrohsis -   Now closer to euvolemic. Continue on
lasix 40 po bid and spironolactone.  Also on lactulose and
rifimaxin with improvement of mental status. Will restart
bactrium SBP prophylaxis.  Paracentesis neg for SBP.
.
#Scrotal cellulitis - Has prior hx of scrotal edema and
bilateral varicoceles per [**Hospital1 2025**] records from [**9-27**].  This admission
was noted to have scrotal erythema and TTP. Started on treated
with levofloxacin and vancomycin when not taking PO. Now will
take a 10d course of cipro.
