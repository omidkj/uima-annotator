Title: REPEAT BEDSIDE SWALLOW EVALUATION
REPEAT BEDSIDE SWALLOWING EVALUATION:

HISTORY:
Thank you for consulting on this 84 y/o female who was admitted
[**2143-11-4**] after chest pain s/p cadiac cath which found 2 vessel
disease. Pt is now s/p CABG x 3, MAZE and [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 30221**] ligation
[**11-12**]. Pt was extubated [**2143-11-15**] and was seen for a bedside
swallow on [**2143-11-18**], followed by a video on [**2143-11-19**]. Pt was
made
NPO after the video swallow due to fatigue and aspiration
combined with overall medical status. Followed up on [**11-25**] but
pt
was reintubated at that time. we were reconsulted after
extubation on [**11-28**] but at that point pt had excess secretions
and was noted to aspirate during oral care. We returned today to
see if pt was ready for a repeat evaluation.

PMH includes NQWMI, known 3VD and RCA stenting [**2138**], HTN,
hyperlipidemia, TIA/CVA, sig family hx of CAD/MI, PAF on
coumadin, mild carotid dz in [**2139**], shingles, gout, ccy, appy,
hysterectomy

EVALUATION:
The examination was performed while the patient was seated
upright in the bed.

Cognition, language, speech, voice:
Pt was A&O x 3 with fluent language. MS and overall status much
improved compared to previous evaluations. Speech was wfl, but
vocal quality was hoarse with low volume. Pt could increase
volume slightly on command, but not to normal volume, concerning
for vocal cord damage. Able to follow all basic commands

Secretions: mild dried secretions in the posterior oral cavity,
could not clear given strong gag reflex

ORAL MOTOR EXAM:
Pt presented with symmetrical facial appearance with adequate
lip
seal and buccal tongue. Tongue was at midline with mildly
reduced
strength, adequate ROM. Palatal elevation mildly reduced but gag
reflex intact.

SWALLOWING ASSESSMENT:
Pt was given nectar thick liquis (tsp, cup) and purees at the
bedside. Oral transit was wfl without oral residue. Pt did not
have overt coughing or throat clearing after the tsps of nectar
thick liquid, then delayed throat clear after the 2nd cup sip of
nectar thick liquid. Pt did not have any signs of aspiration
after purees. Did not give further POs at the bedside. Laryngeal
elevation timely but mildly reduced.

SUMMARY / IMPRESSION:
Pt's swallow function and overall medical status and MS is much
improved compared to previous evaluations. It was recommended pt
been seen for a repeat video swallow, as pt would likely be able
to use compensatory techniques given improved status if needed
to
resume PO intake, whether trials or meals, however per
discussion
with team, pt is scheduled for d/c early tomorrow. If pt is
still
here, would be happy to perform the video swallow prior to d/c
to
rehab, but if not would suggest pt receive the video swallow at
rehab to see if she can be advanced to POs.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
     1. Suggest pt remain NPO until video swallow can be
     completed.
     2. Pt may take ice chips for pleasure if strict oral care
     is maintained.
     3. Video swallow either here tomorrow prior to d/c or upon
     arrival to rehab.

These recommendations were shared with the patient, nurse and
medical team.

REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
r/o inf, eff
AP CHEST, 8:43 A.M. ON [**12-5**]:

HISTORY: Infiltrate and effusions.

IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**12-1**], [**12-3**] and
[**12-4**].

Moderate-sized right pleural effusion has not changed while a
small left pleural effusion has increased in volume since
[**12-3**]. Severe cardiomegaly is stable as is mild
interstitial edema. Nasogastric tube passes below the diaphragm
and out of view. Left subclavian catheter tip projects over the
mid portion of the right atrium. The patient has had median
sternotomy, coronary bypass grafting, and tricuspid valve
replacement. Thoracic aorta is heavily calcified, but not
focally dilated.

Brief Hospital Course:
As mentioned in the HPI, pt presented to the ED with Chest pain.
After stabilization in the ED with appropriate meds and lab
work-up, pt was brought for a cardiac catheterization. Cath
revealed a hazy LMCA, 90% LAD, serial 90% lesion in the OMs, and
no obstructive dz in the RCA except for collaterals to the AM.
Pt. was admitted and received medical management under
cardiology service and consulted cardiac surgery for surgical
revascularization. Prior to surgery pt was started on a Heparin
gtt to keep pt. therapeutic for her A. Fib. Pre-operative labs
were done and an Echo and Carotid u/s were completed. Echo
revealed an EF>55% w/ [**2-3**]+ MR, 2+ TR, and mild pulm. HTN.
Carotid U/S showed less than 40% bilateral ICA stenosis. Pt's
surgery was delayed several days secondary to elevated
