Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Aspirin

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5552**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of Breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Bronchoscopy, Y stent Placement

History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 58 yo F with history of HIV (Last CD4 186 on
[**11-30**]) and recently diagnosed metastatic small cell lung cancer,
presenting with worsening shortness of breath x 5 days. On
admission to the hospital, the patient reported she has had
worsening shortness of breath over the prior 5 days to the point
where she is unable to climb stairs and lie flat. She had been
using her inhalers at home with some relief of symptoms. + cough
with pink tinged sputum 2 days ago. Denied fevers or chills. She
was started on prednisone for these symptoms by her primary
doctor in the week prior to admission. She reports + pleuritic
pain in right chest when coughing. Denied other chest pain,
abdominal pain, urinary complaints, bowel changes, or lower
extremity pain/swelling.

In the ED, initial vital signs were 97.3, HR 109, BP 161/115, RR
40, O2 Sat 97% with neb. O2 sat's decreased to 88% NS. This
improved with continued neb treatments to the mid 90's on 4L.
Original symptoms improved with 2 combivnet nebs. She received
ceftriaxone 1g x 1 and azithromycin 500mg PO x 1 because of
concern for PNA. A CTA was performed and prelim read was no PE.
However, the study showed new mediastinal lymphadenopathy
causing lingular and left upper lobe collapse as well as a
destructive lesion centered in the right third rib with invasion
into the adjacent anterior chest wall and pulmonary parenchyma.


She was initially admitted to OMED but immediately triggered
twice for respiratory distress and was transferred to the ICU.
There, she underwent flexible bronchoscopy which showed that the
right upper lobe was completely occluded with tumor, and also
revealed tumor in the left mid main-stem bronchus with
bronchomalacia of the left mainstem that resulted in complete
occlusion of the airway on exhalation. She was then transferred
to the [**Hospital Ward Name **] for rigid bronchoscopy, which was performed
on [**2170-1-25**]. Endobronchial tumor was debrided with APC and a
Y-stent was deployed successfully. During her ICU course she was
started on levo/flagyl for empiric treatment of post-obstructive
PNA, but given her lack of fevers/WBC/cough, these were d/c'ed
on antibiotic day #4. She was maintained on steroids and a taper
was initiated.

She was transferred back to the OMED service on [**2170-1-27**] for
possible palliative chemo/XRT. At that point her SOB and
associated chest pain had entirely resolved, and that she is in
no pain. She had no F/C and denies any complaints.

At 2:30 AM on [**2170-1-29**], she again was in respiratory distress,
with deep ronchi and desatting down into the low 80s when not
given additional oxygen. She improved with suction; however, a
portable chest x-ray showed severe atelectasis of the right
upper lobe as well as continued near white-out of the left side,
now with even fewer visible lung markings and a more obscured
hemidiaphragm. When asked about intubation, the patient was not
clear on her goals and simply stated that she hoped we didn't
have to do that. She was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for observation
and closer monitoring and nursing care. She was on precautions
for a positive C. diff during this admission, for which she had
been prescribed Flagyl, as below.

. Small cell lung ca: Diagnosed [**9-30**]. Completed her fourth
cycle of chemotherapy with carboplatin and etoposide from
[**2169-12-11**] until [**2169-12-13**].

Social History:
Pt is currently on disability. She used to be a drug and alcohol
counselor. Smoked 2.5ppd x 36 yrs; quit 5 months ago when
diagnosed. No EtOH. History of heroin IV use, cocaine use. Quit
20 years ago. 4 children. She lives with her mother and one of
her daughters.

Family History:
4 children, one son with HIV. Mother: s/p pacer, lymphoma

Physical Exam:
Vitals - HR 89 BP 127/75 RR 26 O2 89% on cool neb oxygen (79-80
on 2.5L when triggered by RN on onc floor)
General - SOB, labored breathing, using accessory muscles of
respiration, not able to use voice, mouthing sentences
Neck - + anterior cervical lymphadenopathy
CV - distant heart sounds, no appreciable murmur
Lungs - extremely loud low-pitched ronchi, unclear air movement
through most of lung fields (i.e., most sounds are projected
upper airway sounds), some air movement at lower right)
Abdomen - soft, NT/ND, BS+

Pertinent Results:
Imaging:
[**2170-1-23**] CXR - Opacity involving the entire left lobe of the lung
is concerning for left lobe destruction.
[**2170-1-23**] CTA - 1. No pulmonary embolus. 2. Marked increased size
of confluent mediastinal lymphadenopathy causing lingular
collapse as well as left upper lobe collapse. Marked increased
size of destructive lesion within the lateral right third rib.
[**2170-1-29**] CXR - verbal report only: significant
atelectasis/collapse of RUL; worsening of opacity and more
obscure hemidiaphragm on left. Only clear region is RLL.

Micro:
[**2169-1-23**] Blood - pending


Brief Hospital Course:
58 yo F with HIV, small cell lung cancer, and HTN admitted with
SOB. Found to have left upper/lingular lung collaspe.

# SOB - She was initially admitted to OMED but immediately
triggered twice for respiratory distress and was transferred to
the ICU. There, she underwent flexible bronchoscopy which showed
that the right upper lobe was completely occluded with tumor,
and also revealed tumor in the left mid main-stem bronchus with

On [**2170-1-29**], she again was in respiratory distress, with deep
ronchi and desatting down into the low 80s when not given
additional oxygen. She improved with suction; however, a
portable chest x-ray showed severe atelectasis of the right

now with even fewer visible lung markings and a more obscured
hemidiaphragm. She was transferred back to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] where a
bronchoscopy was performed and a large mucous plug was removed.
Her respiratory status improved, and she was again called out to
the floor.

On the floor she required interventional pulmonary to perform
one additional bronch on [**2-9**], where additional tumor and mucus
were removed. She received chest PT qid, aggressive mucolytics,
and nebs RTC. She did not plug again but remained with a small
of requirement and a junky exam. Her steroids were tapered as
she briefly experienced some hallucinations thought to be a side
effect.  Respiratory s
