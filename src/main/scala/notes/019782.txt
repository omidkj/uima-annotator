CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2123-6-16**] 8:42 PMTECHNIQUE AND FINDINGS: PA and
lateral chest x-ray dated [**2123-6-16**] is compared to the PA and
lateral chest x-ray of [**2123-3-17**]. There is a new large right
pleural effusion. The heart displays stable enlargement. The
mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. The lungs show
no focal areas of consolidation to suggest pneumonia. There is
mild prominence of the perihilar pulmonary vasculature with
peribronchial cuffing indicating mild congestive heart failure.
Left- sided pacemaker is in unchanged position. The aorta is
calcified throughout its course.

IMPRESSION: Interval development of right-sided pleural
effusion. Mild congestive heart failure. No focal areas of
consolidation to suggest pneumonia.

UNILAT LOWER EXT VEINS LEFT  [**2123-6-16**] 8:03 PM
IMPRESSION: Interval partial recanalization of the left common
femoral, superficial femoral, and popliteal veins.

Cardiology Report ECHO Study Date of [**2123-6-22**]
 Conclusions:
The left atrium is elongated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall
left
ventricular systolic function is severely depressed with global
hypokinesis
and akinesis of the distal anterior wall /antero-septum and
apex. No masses or
thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. Right ventricular
chamber size and
free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets are
severely
thickened/deformed. There is severe aortic valve stenosis. Mild
(1+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There
is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. [Due to
acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may be
significantly
UNDERestimated.] The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. The
pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
There is no
pericardial effusion.

Compared with the findings of the prior report (tape unavailable
for review)
of [**2120-6-28**], the LVEF has significantly decreased and the aortic
stenosis is
now severe.

IMPRESSION: Severe aortic stenosis with severely depressed LVEF.
Regional wall
motion abnormalities c/w CAD (multivessel).

      with mixed fecal flora. Clinical significance of
isolate(s)

Brief Hospital Course:
1) UTI: The patient was found to have a positive UA on
admission. Given her history of ESBL resistant Klebsiella UTIs
in the past, she was treated with imipenem for 7 days per ID
(Started [**2123-6-16**]). Her urine culture showed fecal contamination,
but repeat urinalysis and culture was negative after 5 days of
treatment with Imipenem.

2) CHF with severe AS / pulmonary edema / pleural effusion - On
the second morning of admission, the patient became markedly
hypertensive and hypoxic with ABG showing respiratory acidosis:
7.15/60/129. She had been given fluid boluses overnight for
decreased urine output. She was felt to be fluid overloaded and
also hypertensive which led to pulmonary edema and given lasix
and nitro paste. She had unchanged EKG and a small troponin leak
in the setting of increased demand, CXR showed pulmonary edema
with pleural effusion which was felt to be likely CHF related.
She reponded well to BiPAP while in [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] and was back to room
air for the remainder of admission. She got an echocardiogram
which showed EF of 30% and AV area of 0.7 cm2, worse than
previous echo in [**2120**]. She was converted to long acting Toprol.
An ACE was considered but used with caution given her AS.

3) RLE swelling: The patient had a swollen bump on her left leg
which appeared red, warm and fluctuent. General surgery was
called to I&D this area. It revealed old clot with culture and
gram stain negative on prelim results. She was treated with
morphine for pain in this area after the procedure. Three days
later, it spontaneously started bleeding and surgery was called
to bedside. Pressure was applied. The recommendation was to
discontinue wet to dry dressings as these can remove the scar
tissue and exacerbate bleeding.

4) altered mental status - After beginnig the antibiotic
therapy, the patient returned to baseline per granddaughter
which was cooperative, responsive, and oriented occasionally
only to herself. The night of [**6-22**] pt was less responsive after
1:30 am (got 2 mg morphine at 12:30 am for pain and SOB until 8
am. Head CT was negative and glucose was normal. This resolved
by 9 am so narcotic was most likely cause, and morphine was used
sparingly after this.

5) Bleeding/anemia: Her HCT was stable during admission until
the AM of [**6-21**]
