Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1974**]
Chief Complaint:
hypercapneic respiratory failure

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Bronchoscopy
Intubation


History of Present Illness:
62 y/o female with PMHx of DM, obesity, HTN, angina,
hypercholesteremia who took phenegren and some percocet prior to
admission for episodes of vomiting (She ate dinner on Wed and
started vomiting immediately after). Patient went to sleep and
was then unarousable by family after a few hours so was brought
[**Hospital1 15331**] ED. When she arrived her ABG was 7.17/78/124 on NRB
which resulted in her getting intubated. She was also found to
be hyperkalemic and in renal failure with K 7.24; BUN 29; Cre
4.0. She was given IVF and her BUN and Cre improved to 31/3.1.
She was given glucose and insulin as well as kayexalate and her
K decreased to 5.4. While she was being intubated she was found
to have thick secreations in her airway. Her CXR at the OSH did
not show any obvious infiltrate. Patient was afebrile but did
have a WBC of 11 with 5 bands and was given a dose of
ceftriaxone.  Her renal failure resolved with hydration and she
was extubated [**3-23**] without incident after bronch [**3-4**] revealed
minimal secretions without plugging, although culture revealed
S. aureus (vanco added). LENIs were negative, prompting
discontinuation of IV heparin for possible PE. Labetalol drip
was started for BP control (180s/100s).
She was transferred to the floor [**3-26**] AM without incident.

Social History:
No tobacco, no etoh, no drug use by her history. Married, lives
in [**Location (un) 72241**] with husband and daughter, unemployed, from
[**Name (NI) 4754**]. However, husband continues to smoke.

Family History:

Physical Exam:

Pleasant A+Ox3 elderly female, severely obese, NAD. No carotid
bruits
Lungs CTA B without significant rales or wheezes
RRR S1S2 I/VI benign SEM ULSB
Abd severely obese, ND NT BS+, no rebound or guarding
Extr no pitting edema with 2+ B DP pulses.


Pertinent Results:
[**2138-3-26**] SPEECH/SWALLOW: No s/s aspiration.  [**Month (only) 116**] have reg diet
with thin liquids.  Pills whole with thin liquids.
.
[**2138-3-20**] CXR: Technically limited study with retrocardiac density
which may represent atelectasis versus airspace consolidation.
Engorged vasculature but no evidence of frank edema.
.
[**2138-3-21**] BILAT LE VEINS: No evidence of lower extremity DVT.
.
[**2138-3-21**] CXR: Layering left pleural effusion and left
retrocardiac opacity, representing atelectasis and/or infectious
consolidation. The right hemithorax is not completely imaged on
this study, but is more completely evaluated on the subsequent
and separately dictated chest radiograph.
.
[**2138-3-23**] CXR:  Suboptimal image due to underinflation of the lungs
and blurring artifact. Patchy opacities at both bases,
particularly on the left side may represent airspace
disease/atelectasis. Patchy density appearing in the left hilar
area may also represent airspace disease.
.
[**2138-3-21**] SPUTUM: GRAM STAIN (Final [**2138-3-21**]):
      >25 PMNs and <10 epithelial cells/100X field.
      2+   (1-5 per 1000X FIELD):   GRAM POSITIVE COCCI.
                                    IN PAIRS AND CHAINS.

   RESPIRATORY CULTURE (Final [**2138-3-24**]):
      SPARSE GROWTH OROPHARYNGEAL FLORA.
      STAPH AUREUS COAG +.    SPARSE GROWTH.
      Oxacillin sensitive.

Brief Hospital Course:
1) RESPIRATORY FAILURE:
Initially, concern for pneumonia vs PE.  Pt was noted to have
thick secretions and underwent bronchoscopy.  She was started on
broad spectrum abx (vanco, levo, azithro) for pneumonia.  CXR
was poor but did show infiltrate.  Culture grew out MSSA so abx
were narrowd to levaquin only and she will complete a 10d
course.  In ICU, pt was extubated successfully and upon transfer
to floor her respiratory status was stable.  She remained mildly
hypoxic (mid 90s on RA) but this may be secondary to obesity.
PE was concern and pt was initially on heparin empirically.  A
CTA could not be done given size but LENIs were negative b/l.
Givenn this, her heparin was stopped and she continued to
improved off heparin, PE was not likely.  Pt was also wheezing
so she may have underlying RAD that flared with pneumonia.  She
was started on bronchodilators and inhaled steroids.  These can
be stopped once her pneumonia is cleared given she has no h/o
asthma or COPD.
.
2) ACUTE RENAL FAILURE:
On initialy presentation to [**Hospital3 51058**], pt's Cr was 4.0.
This improved steadily with IVF hydration suggesting a prerenal
etiology.  By discharge, her creatinine was wnl (0.5).
.
3) HTN URGENCY:
After extubation, pt became very agitated and in this setting
SBP went up to 190s with DBP over 100.  She was initially
started on labetalol gtt.  Then PO meds were restarted.
Lopressor and nifedipine were added to her regimen with improved
though not ideal control.  She may need further titration of her
meds to maximize BP control over long term.
.
4) TRANSAMINITIS/ELEV CK:
This was likely due to mild rhabdo from being down.  CKs
improved steadily with supportive care to around 300 several
days before discharge.  Her lovastatin was held, however, and
not restarted at this time.  Her lovastatin can be restarted (or
another statin) by her outpt provider.
.
5) HYPOTHYROIDISM:
Continued on home dose of levothyroxine.
.
6) DIABETES MELLITUS, Type 2:
Initially, placed on SSI in ICU.  Once taking POs, glyburide was
restarted.  Her metformin was not restarted in the hospital
because her BG were very well controlled.  But this may need to
be restarted down the road.
.
6) LEG PAIN:
AFter extubation, pt c/o b/l calf pain.  LENIs were negative for
clot.  Exam did not show tndr, therefore, neuropathic pain from
critical illness is possible.  She was given neurontin which can
be titrated up and oxycodone for pain control.
