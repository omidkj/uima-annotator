Brief Hospital Course:
81 [**Last Name (un) **] with multiple medical problems including CAD, afib, DM,
[**Name (NI) 2091**], UTIs, C. diff, and diastolic CHF who has had recurrent
admissions since her CABG [**4-20**]. She has a history of recurrent
aspirations, and  presented today from her NH with
encephalopathy, respiratory distress, fever, and tachycardia.
Per conversations by ED and ICU housestaff, her daughter and son
in law wanted admission and antibiotics only (no central line or
any other procedures). She was given Vanc, Zosyn, Levofloxacin
and admitted to ICU.

Shortly after arrival to ICU, pt became hypotensive, with SBP
50. Only access is single 20g pphl. Family??????s wishes were for pt
to get antibiotics but no CVL or other procedures or
interventions. Given hypotension, and minimal IV access,
decision made to use IV for Morphine and to make pt comfort
measures only. Antibiotics discontinued, starting Morphine IV
now with goals of care redirected towards comfort. Patient
passed away shortly thereafter.
