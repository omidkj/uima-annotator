Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1838**]
Chief Complaint:
Dense left hemi, globally aphasic.


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
s/p IV tPA [**2135-6-17**]
Neuro-intervention with clot retrieval [**2135-6-17**] - solitaire
stentretriever, MERCI, and baloon angioplasty and right MCA
recanalized (TIMI 2 flow).
PEG tube insertion [**2135-6-23**]

History of Present Illness:
83-year-old right-handed woman presenting with
the above on a background of newly discoverd paroxysmal atrial
fibrillation. She and her daughter were visiting her other
daughter. She was standing, looking out of the window, when she
suddenly said 'oh' and the seemed to try sitting down on a
chair.
However, she missed the chair and instead slowly collapsed
between bed and wall. She did not hit her head. Immediately
afterward she was noted to have a dense left hemiparesis and was
unable to speak. 911 was called and she was brought to
[**Hospital1 **]. There, a CT showed old right temporal
hypodensity suggestive of an old ischemic/hemorrhagic infarct of
unknown age. Given this finding tPA was thought to be
contraindicated. Instead, patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for
further evaluation and care.

hypokalemia

.
Discharge examination:
Very drowsy but responds to sternal rub and can generally follow
simple commands. Eye opening apraxia but fervently cloes eyes
when try to open but can open eyes spontaneously to command
intermittently. Can possibly say her name in a very dysarthric
manner although not consistently and is essentially mute.
Brainstem reflexes intact, (Left eye surgical pupil and fixed at
roughly 4mm and irreular right 2mm reactive) neglects left side,
withdraws to noxious in all limbs with dorsiflexion in left
ankle and extension in left arm. Spontaneous movement on right
wiggles toes and moves right arm reasonably well. Grimaces all 4
limbs. Left plantar extensor.

Radiology:
CTA HEAD W&W/O C & RECONS; CT BRAIN PERFUSION; CTA NECK W&W/OC &
RECONS [**2135-6-17**] 5:58 PM

IMPRESSION:
1.  Head CT demonstrates encephalomalacia in the right temporal
region with
loss of [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter differentiation in the middle cerebral
artery
distribution indicative of an evolving infarct.  No hemorrhage
seen.
2.  CT perfusion demonstrates large area of increased transit
time and
decreased blood volume and decreased blood flow.  The findings
indicate a
large area of ischemia and infarction in the right middle
cerebral artery
territory.
3.  CT angiography of the neck demonstrates no evidence of
vascular occlusion
or stenosis.
4.  CT angiography of the head demonstrates occlusion of the M1
segment of the
right middle cerebral artery immediately distal to the
supraclinoid internal
carotid artery bifurcation.  There is some visualization of the
vascular
structures seen within the right sylvian region likely secondary
to collateral
circulation.

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST	Study Date of [**2135-6-17**] 11:18 PM
IMPRESSION:  Evolving large right MCA territory infarct.
Hyperdensity in the
right temporoparietal cortices, basal ganglia and right frontal
subarachnoid
spaces, can be relate to the recent contrast administration or
hemorrhage.
Recommended followup imaging to exclude hemorrhage.
