History of Present Illness:
65 yo male with very complicated medical history presents to
[**Hospital1 18**] from OSH after developing 6/10 chest pain today at rehab.
States pain began around 3 am while he was lying in bed.
Located substernal, non-radiating, constant for over one hour,
denies any associated nausea, diaphoresis, or SOB.  Denies every
having a similar pain in the past, rates the pain [**8-13**] in
severity.  Patient was recently admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] for a
prolonged hospitalization from [**7-14**] to [**8-20**] for mesenteric
ischemia complicated by myocardial infarction, respiratory
failure, duodenal angioectasia, and presumed MRSA pneumonia.
During that stay, he underwent an exploratory laparotomy,
segmental ileal resection, and mesenteric vessel exploration,
with successfuly stenting of the SMA.  He also underwent
resection of 8 cm distal ileum, terminal ileum and right colon
resulting in ileotransverse colostomy.
.
Following surgery, he was found to have troponin elevation to
.62, with normal CKs, ST depressions on EKG.  He underwent
cardiac cath on [**8-4**] which showed a right dominant system, left
main and 3 vessel disease.  The LMCA had a distal 70% lesion,
LAD had an 80% ostial lesion with mid/distal 80% lesion, and LCx
had an occluded OM2 with collateral filling.  The RCA was
proximally occluded with left coronary collaterals.  He was
evaluated by CT [**Doctor First Name **] for CABG, but thought to be a high risk
candidate given his comorbidities and active illness, and the
decision was made for medical management with reevaluation for
CABG after recovery.  He was unable to be weaned from the vent,
and a trach was placed.  In addition, an IVC filter was placed
for DVT prophylaxis.
.
Today the patient was initially taken to [**Hospital3 12594**], found to have ST depressions in anterior leads on EKG,
positive troponin of 1.76.  He was given lasix for presumed CHF,
heparin, beta-blocker, and aspirin, started on nitro gtt for
persistent chest pain and subsequently became hypotensive.  On
arrival to [**Hospital1 18**] ED, the patient was chest pain free, EKG showed
ST depressions II, V4-V5, TWI II, III, avF, V4-V5.  Initial
vitals were 97.6/ bp 105/92/ 72/ 24/ 98% on 3L.  He became
hypotensive to 70's systolically, LIJ placed and dopamine
started.  Cardiac enzymes here CK 386, MB 29, index 12.7,
troponin 2.2.  BNP [**Numeric Identifier 13168**].  One dose of Vanc given.  Pt
demonstrated signs of altered mental status, and the heparin was
stopped until an emergent head CT could be obtained.  However
this was deferred as the patient was taken to cath lab.
.
Cardiac cath revealed 3-VD, LMCA with 80% distal, diffuse 50-60%
stenosis, apical 70% stenosis.  LAD showed ostial 80%, LCX
diffuse 60-70% stenosis with total occlusion of distal OM1.  BMS
placed in LMCA/LAD, PTCA of OM1.  The patient was changed to
levophed for BP support and transferred to CCU for further
management.
.
On arrival to CCU pt states he is pain free, denies any
complaints.  Further review of symptoms negative for prior
history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary
embolism, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools
or red stools. He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors. He
does note right hand tremor when he is cold and left arm
weakness and numbness since his last hospitalization.  Denies
feeling lightheaded or dizzy.  All of the other review of
systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
positive for chronic dyspnea, no orthopnea, no palpitations,
syncope or presyncope.

2D-ECHOCARDIOGRAM performed on [**2179-9-20**]:
The left atrium is normal in size. The estimated right atrial
pressure is 5-10 mmHg. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with normal cavity size. Due to suboptimal technical
quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully
excluded. There is moderate to severe global left ventricular
hypokinesis (LVEF = 35 %). No masses or thrombi are seen in the
left ventricle. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The aortic root is mildly dilated at the
sinus level. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic
valve leaflets appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is mild
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a trivial
pericardial effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2179-7-29**],
global left ventricular systolic function is more depressed (but
was overestimated on the prior study).
.
CARDIAC CATH performed on [**2179-8-4**] demonstrated:
1.  Coronary angiography in this right dominant system
demonstrated left main and 3 vessel disease.  The LMCA had a
distal 70% lesion.  The LAD had an 80% ostial lesion with
mid/distal 80% lesion.  The LCx
system had an occluded OM2 with collateral filling.  The RCA was

proximally occluded with left coronary collaterals.
2.  Resting hemodynamics revealed normal left ventricular
systolic
pressure of 104 mm Hg and normal LVEDP of 12 mm Hg.  Sytemic
arterial
systolic and diastolic pressures were normal.
3.  Left ventriculography revealed no mitral regurgitation, mild
global hypokinesis, and LVEF of 45%.
.
CARDIAC CATH on [**2179-9-19**]:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Normal ventricular function.
3. Acute anterior myocardial infarction, managed by acute ptca.
4. Successful PCI of the left main-left anterior descending
artery.
5. Successful PCI of the mid left anterior descending artery.
6. Angioplasty of the first obtuse marginal.
