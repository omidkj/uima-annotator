History of Present Illness:
HPI: This is a 76 YO M initially presented to OSH on [**6-4**] with
bilateral cellulitis, lower extremity edema on [**6-11**] was noted to
have respiratory distress failing his routine nightly bipap for
OSA.  At that pt was transferred to CCU for monitoring.
.
His OSH was as follows
- Cellulitis - was treated with unasyn for 11 days then
discontinued on [**6-16**].  A LENI on [**6-17**] was negative for DVT.
.
- Cardiac- His CCU stay was complicated by VT with a code
called, which required dopamine pressure.  In addition a NSTEMI
(peak trop 7.67 on [**6-12**]) occurred treated with aspirin, plavix,
and coreg. Apparently heparin was held [**1-28**] to bleeding from the
tracheostomy. Then the beta blocker was held secondary to
bradycarida.

- Respiratory - On transfer to the CCU a "possibly elective
tracheostomy at this point" which was performed on [**6-11**]. He was
started on CPAP trach mask trials.  He was felt to be fluid
overloaded and diuresed. A left sided pleural effusion developed
and a thoracentesis was performed on [**6-23**], and he was started on
cefazolin.  Sputum cxs grew out proteus with multiple
sensitivies.  A lyme cx taken was negative.
.
- On presentation- the pt is comfortable denies pain, sob,
states his (myasthenia [**Last Name (un) 2902**]) MG is longstanding causing
difficulty with walking/ and breathing at certain pts. Otherwise
no other complaints.

Imaging
.
ECHO [**2151-6-30**]
IMPRESSIOn: Poor echo windows. Cannot reliably assess LVEF.
Normal RVEF. No  pericardial effusion. If clinically indicated a
repeat study with echo  contrast (Definity) may better
characterize LVEF.
.
Chest Portable [**2151-7-3**]
IMPRESSION:
Increased layering of left pleural fluid - positional
differences could explain. No new focal consolidations.
.
[**Last Name (un) **]-INTESTINAL TUBE PLACEMENT (W/FLUORO) [**2151-7-9**]
IMPRESSION:
Successful placement of post-pyloric tube in the third portion
of the duodenum.

Brief Hospital Course:
76 yo male with pmhx significant for morbid obesity, OSA,
trach'd p/w cellulitis with course complicated by NSTEMI.
.
1. Cellulitis- At outside hospital was started on unasyn, then
transitioned to ancef but developed an abx rash, and was changed
to vancomycin by arrival to [**Hospital1 18**]. He was noted to have
bilateral cellulitis with increased lower extremity swelling and
was to finished a 14 day antibiotic course, and monitor for
resolving infection.  He otherwise was treated symptomatically
with aquaphor ointment, and did not spike a fever during his
hospital course. He has residual b/l LE erythema that has been
stable with no other signs of infection.
.
2. HYPOXIA- The patient arrived with a tracheostomy from an OSH,
on AC ventilation, when a trach mask trial was attempted, he
developed increasing tachypnea, anxiety, and chest pain, which
was not cardiac in nature.  With a history of MG a NIF was
performed which demonstrated low values, but his limited ability
for successful trach mask trial, was likely multifactorial, a
sputum culture grew swarming proteus and he was started [**Female First Name (un) **] 8
day course of levaquin, he was to have daily NIFs as there are
rare exacerbations of MG with levaquin, he remained stable.  He
otherwise was maintained on duonebs, and fluticasone was added.
In addition fluid overload was another potential component of
his inability to be weaned from the vent, and he was actively
diuresed with 40mg lasix [**Hospital1 **], but his creatinine became elevated
to 2.2 from 1.1 baseline likely secondary to overdiuresis as his
fena suggestsed a prerenal acute renal failure.  He was
administered fluid boluses to maintain urine output.  Otherwise
IP was consulted for a tracheostomy adjustment and felt he was
maintaining appropriate oxygenation and ventilation and
adjustments were not required. He tolerated weaning to pressure
support with MMV at times but during his hospital course
developed additional hypoxia asso
