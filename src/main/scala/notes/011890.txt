Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2836**]
Chief Complaint:
Increased abdominal pain


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
ERCP

History of Present Illness:
67 yo F with h/o PUD which was c/b gastric outlet obstruction
s/p vagotomy, antrectomy and bilroth II repair [**4-22**] c/b jejunal
stump leak and recurrent liver abscesses s/p drainage and
fistula creation, polymicrobial BSI s/p treatment course of
daptomycin, meropenem, fluconazole (finished course of IV abx on
[**2129-11-17**]) presenting with worsening abdominal pain. Patient has
had an extensive medical course since surgery in [**4-22**] including
multiple hospitalizations and rehab stays and was on IV abx
until [**2129-11-17**]. She was living in an ECF ([**Month/Day/Year 5682**]) until around
when abx were discontinued and went home to live with her
husband. She was doing okay at home, with increasing PO intake
and a stable level of pain and nausea however over the last few
days, her pain has worsened. Per family, on Tuesday last week
patient was admitted to [**Hospital **] Hospital after a fall. Patient
doesn't remember the fall, but she had just taken several pain
medications (incl dilaudid, which she takes every 4 hours 4 mg
without fail) and per her daughter and husband she often gets
confused after taking her medications. She had a workup at
[**Hospital **] hospital which showed no fractures or other process, and
was discharged within a few hours to [**Hospital 5682**] ECF again.
.
Over the last few days at [**Hospital 5682**], paitent has complained of
worsening pain and stable nausea. Denies any vomiting,
constipation, cough, fevers, chills, or other symptoms. She
presented today for worsening pain despite her pain medications.
Pain is stabbing in nature associated with nausea. Also thinks
that her fistual output may be increasing.
.
In the ED, initial VS were 98.8 100 111/60 24 94% ra. ED exam
with diffuse ttp mainly over the RUQ/RLQ. Ostomy site with green
cloudy fluid. Labs notable for WBC 26.1, Hct 27.7 (at baseline),
ALT 131, AST 51, Na 132, HCO3 19, alk phos 1452. CT abd/pelvis
with Left lower lobe opacification compatible with pneumonia,
decreased mid abdominal collection. She received dilaudid 1 mg
IV x 2, zofran as well as IV ativan. Surgery consulted in ED,
recommended CT abd with contrast, CT abd was done which showed
abscesses largely unchanged but LLL PNA. Surgery recommended no
intervention now, admit to medicine for IV abx for PNA with
surgery following. Pt was given dose of vanco/zosyn for HCAP.
.
Currently, patient complains of [**4-21**] pain, much imprved from
when she came in, howver she is not oriented to place or year
having just received IV ativan and dilaudid. Per daughter who
gave most history, patient veyr often gets like this after
receiving pain or anxiety medications.

.
Per Opt ID note:
Subsequent course after initial surgery was complicated by
polymicrobial BSI (Enterobacter cloacae, VRE, MRSA, Clostridium)
and hepatic abscess requiring drainage on [**6-1**] (Enterobacter,
Enterococcus) s/p drain removal and prolonged course of
antibiotic therapy (daptomycin, ertapenem) ending [**7-6**].
.
She was re-admitted on [**7-15**] with a recurrent fluid collection.
Treatment with daptomycin and meropenem was re-initiated.  She
underwent CT guided drainage of that major collection and
cultures grew [**Female First Name (un) 564**] albicans and [**Female First Name (un) 29361**], VRE.  Micafungin
was added to her antibiotic regimen.
.
In the setting of a persistent leukocytosis, she was found to
have a new liver abscess on [**7-30**] and underwent CT guided
drainage with fluid growing VRE, MRSA and yeast. On [**7-28**], her
antibiotics were simplifed to tigecycline, micafungin.  however
due to abdominal cramping which may have been in part related to
tigecycline, her regimen was changed to daptomycin, ertapenem,
and fluconazole on [**2129-8-11**].
.
On [**8-17**] she was readmitted to the hospital for elevation of LFTs
and increasing abdominal pain. CT of the abdomen on [**8-17**] showed
an increased fluid collection in the caudate lobe of the liver
measuring 2.1x2.3cm. Patient had CT guided drainage of the fluid
collection on [**8-19**] and culture results grew Klebsiella pneumoniae
that was pansensitive. Patient was maintained on Daptomycin and
Fluconazole however Ertapenem was changed to Meropenem on [**8-18**].
Decision was made to maintain the patient on Meropenem on
discharge instead of ertapenem for coverage of Enterbacter which
grew previously as she seemed to have improvement in her
abdominal pain, transaminitis, and remained afebrile with
Meropenem. Dosing was changed from q6h to q8h to help ease
administration of the medicine.
.
Antibiotic course:
[**Date range (1) 90350**] Daptomycin, Ertapenem
[**Date range (1) 3047**] Daptomycin
[**Date range (1) 90351**] Linezolid
[**Date range (1) 90352**] Meropenem
[**Date range (1) 29023**] Tigecycline (switched due to abd cramping)
[**Date range (1) 90353**] Micafungin
[**8-11**] abx changed to Daptomycin, Ertapenem, and Fluconazole on
discharge
[**8-18**] Daptomycin and Fluconazole continued from previous discharge
and Ertapenem changed to Meropenem
.
She had a CT of the abdomen on [**11-1**] which showed some minimal
improvement in previously seen fluid collections near the liver
though a new 2cm fluid collection was found in between the loops
of the jejunum (not amenable to percutaneous drainage).  On
[**11-17**], she was taken off Daptomycin, Meropenem.  An was started
on Bactrim DS 1 tab po BID and continue Fluconazole 400mg po
daily.
