Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2297**]
Chief Complaint:
Fever, abdominal pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
1. Debridement of abdominal wall abscess

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 34682**] is a 39 year-old male with h/o Prader-Willi
Syndrome, T2DM, HTN, s/p trach and PEG, recent treatment for c.
diff, recent treatment for VAP and UTI, and recent initiation of
HD [**3-3**] ARF on CRI of unclear etiology, who presents from [**Hospital 100**]
Rehab after experiencing fever and diffuse abdominal pain. On
[**8-26**], his temp was found to be 100.5, with slight tachycardia
to 105. He was given 1 dose vanc IV at HD on [**8-26**] for erythema
and discharge from G-tube site, and restarted on PO vanco for
suspicion of c. diff, although pt had no diarrhea. His vent
settings had been stable at PS 15/5 on FIO2 35% with RR 20-24
and Vt 300-400mL with mod white secretions, but on [**8-27**], RT
noted increased secretions and decreased Vt to 240-300mL with
temp climbing to 102F. CXR was reportedly non-diagnostic [**3-3**]
large body habitus. BCx were sent on [**8-26**], which had no growth
after 24h. Sputum was also sent for culture, and gram stain
demonstrated many GNR and mod GPR, with 5-10 PMNs/HPF and 0-5
epis/HPF. UA was turbid and positive for UTI, with UCx pending.
Wbc was found to be elevated to 32, with elevated alk phos to
500s. Given one dose ceftaz 2gm on [**8-27**] and sent to ED for
further evaluation.
.
Per [**Hospital 100**] Rehab notes, Mr. [**Known lastname 34682**] has bilateral heel decubs.
He also is thought to have possible DVTs, but with inconsistent
exam, d-dimer, and inconclusive LENIs. He is being
anticoagulated, but found to be subtherapeutic on Coumadin 7.5mg
PO qD, and was being treated with IV heparin bridge.
.
In the ED, initial VS were T 102.4F, BP: 124/93, HR: 121, RR:
29, SaO2 96% His initial labs were notable for an elevated wbc
to 32.5 (83% PMN, 5% bands) with lactate 1.8, a mild
transaminitis (AST 59, ALT 73), elevated alk phos at 1178 with a
normal tbili of 0.8, and normal amylase/lipase. INR was elevated
at 1.8. CXR was uninterpretable. Due to his morbid obesity, Mr.
[**Known lastname 34682**] could not undergo CT scan, and had no informative
imaging done. He was given vancomycin and cefepime, and
transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for further management.
.
Mr. [**Known lastname 34682**] was last discharged from [**Hospital1 **] on [**8-2**] after a
prolonged stay for ARF of unclear etiology. After multiple
failed attempts at HD access in OR, had cut-down tunneled L IJ
Perma Cath placed. Also had acetinobacter PNA and Klebsiella UTI
during this admission, s/p Unasyn x 14 days, ending [**7-31**].
Covered prophylactically for recent c. diff with PO vanc, ending
[**8-14**].

Brief Hospital Course:
Plan:
1) Shock:
Patient was admitted in septic shock secondary to abdominal wall
abscess surrounding his G tube insertion site. Patient's
additional sources included acinetobacter pneumonia, VRE in
abdominal wound, pseudomonal pneumonia, and yeast in the
abdominal wound. For antibiotics, patient was started on a
course of caspofungin, tobramycin, and daptomycin. Given
patient's obese body habitus, most radiological imaging is not
useful in this patient. Patient completed a two week course of
antibiotics s/p OR debridement.

2) Respiratory failure:
Patient was started on a trach during his last admission and per
his family would like to maintain current settings. Patient had
moderate secretions during this admission and was started on
daptomycin and tobramycin for treatment of acinetobacter and
pseudomonal pneumonia.

3) Renal failure:
During [**7-5**], patient developed renal failure of unclear etiology
and has been on hemodialysis since [**7-5**]. During this admission,
patient initially required CVVH due to poor renal function and
then was transitioned back to hemodialysis without
complications.

4) h/o DVT:
This diagnosis was made clinically, due to patient's calf pain
and inability to obtain adequate imaging. Patient was
supratherapeutic while taking coumadin and heparin. Given the
risks of maintaining patient on heparin or coumadin, coumadin
was discontinued.

5) Anemia:
Likely secondary to renal failure and chronic phlebotomizing.
Patient's Hct remained stable during this admission.

6) T2DM:
Has always been poorly controlled (HbA1C 11.2 [**3-6**]). Patient's
blood sugars however have been adequately controlled with
current regimen of Glargine 60U with breakfast and sliding scale
insulin. Pt's sliding scale upon discharge was to start with
8units of regular insulin from 121-160 and then increasing by 4
units for every 40 increase in BG above 160.

7) Hypothyroidism:
Patient's TSH suggests hypothyroidism, although unclear the
accuracy of the diagnosis since thyroid levels were assessed
while patient was already in the ICU. Patient was initially
started on just Levothyroxine PO 75 which was then converted to
IV levothyroxine 150 for improved absorption.

8) FEN:
Patient was maintained on Nepro Full strength with Beneprotein,
40 gm/day at a goal rate of 45 mL/hour. Residual Check: q4h Hold
feeding for residual >= : 150 ml
Flush w/ 50 ml water Before and after each feeding
