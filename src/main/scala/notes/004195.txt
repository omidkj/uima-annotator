Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1271**]
Chief Complaint:
Increasing large, chronic left subdural hematoma, associated
with functional deterioration

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 67M with Parkinson's disease diagnosed a few
years ago.  He was referred to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 59664**] on [**2102-10-26**] for
evaluation of mental status changes including gait and balance,
which had been getting progressively worse over the last six
months. He also noted diplopia for nearly a year without any
ophthalmological etiology. He brought multiple studies (MRI/CT)
for evaluation, and it was determined that evacuation of the SDH
would provide the best chance at possibly allieviating symptoms
given the enlarging size of the hematoma.

Past Medical History:
Parkinson's disease, with nighttime hallucinations
L subdural hemorrhage
Hyperlipidemia

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient electively admitted on [**2102-12-18**] for evacuation of chronic
left subdural hematoma complicated by subarachnoid hemmorhage.
[**2102-12-20**]: EEG performed: IMPRESSION: Markedly abnormal portable
EEG due to the slow and disorganized background rhythm and due
to the prominent focal sharp waves in the left fronto-temporal
region and, less frequently, in the right frontal area. A slow
background indicates a widespread encephalopathy. Medications,
metabolic disturbances, and infection are among the most common
causes. This should not come from a subdural hematoma alone in
most cases. There were very frequent sharp waves,
mostly in the left anterior quadrant (and occasionally right
frontally), but there were no repetitive discharges to indicate
ongoing seizures at the time. Finally, there was no prominent
voltage asymmetry
[**2102-12-21**]: IV antibiotics started secondary to gram negative rods
in the sputum.
[**2102-12-22**]: CT performed: IMPRESSION: Compared to the prior study
dated [**2102-12-19**], there has been interval improvement of the
pneumocephalus. There is a persistent left-sided subdural
collection causing mass effect upon the left cerebral hemisphere
and 6 mm midline shift, which is unchanged. Persistent
widespread subarachnoid hemorrhage. Stable focal
intraparenchymal hemorrhage in the left frontal region. Left
subclavian line placed for continued antibiotic treatment.
[**2102-12-25**]: Portable chest x-ray to follow up temp spike to 102:
IMPRESSION:
1. Pulmonary edema with superimposed right middle lobe/right
lower lobe infection and/or aspiration.
2. Left retrocardiac atelectasis, however, pneumonia cannot be
excluded.
3. Lines, tubes and catheters are in satisfactory location.
[**2102-12-26**]: Trach placed in OR, PEG postponed due to fevers.
[**2102-12-30**]: IMPRESSION:
1. Compared to the prior CT, there is slight increased size of
the left-sided subdural CSF intensity collection with midline
shift which has slightly increased with subfalcine herniation.
The right temporal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] is more dilated compared to the previous
study. Extensive subarachnoid hemorrhage and hemorrhagic
contusions are again identified without new hemorrhage.
2. No definite aneurysm is identified but the vascular
structures are less distinctly visualized which could be due to
mild non-occlusive spasm. Proximal basilar artery demonstrates
narrowing which could be due to stenosis as described
previously.
[**2102-12-31**]: Staples removed from cranial wound.
[**2103-1-1**]: Patient received 2U PRBC's for black tarry stool(guiac
negative)
[**2103-1-4**]: Percutaneous Gastrostomy Tube placed.
[**2103-1-5**]: Tube feeds begun without incident.
