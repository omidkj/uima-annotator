Date of Birth:   [**2045-6-9**]       Sex:  M

Service:  CCU

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Shortness of breath.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 73 year old
male with the diagnosis of ischemic cardiomyopathy who awoke
on the morning of admission and presented to an outside
hospital.  He had previously been seen as an outpatient for
shortness of breath one week ago and was diagnosed with CHF
exacerbation at which time his Lasix dose had been doubled
and resulted in a 6 pound weight loss over two days.
Subsequently his urine output started to decline.  In the
emergency room at the outside hospital he was given 80 mg IV
of Lasix which resulted in hypotension and tachycardia with
minimal urine output.  He then received a normal saline bolus
which improved his blood pressure and heart rate.  He was
then transferred to [**Hospital1 69**].

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Coronary artery disease.  History of
postoperative myocardial infarction after surgery.  He has a
pacemaker placed in [**2113**] dual chamber placed after a
bradycardiac episode.  Diabetes type 2 recently started on
glipizide.  Peripheral vascular disease.  Abdominal aortic
aneurysm status post repair.  Colon cancer status post
resection and diverting colostomy in [**2084**].  Melanoma status
post resection.  Congestive heart failure with EF of
approximately 15% attributed to ischemia.
Hypercholesterolemia.  Renal insufficiency baseline
creatinine approximately 2 to 2.5.  Status post right CEA.
Known 100% occluded left carotid artery.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Lasix 40 mg p.o. q.d., Lipitor 40
mg p.o. q.d., captopril 12.5 mg t.i.d., Lopressor 50 mg
t.i.d., glipizide 2.5 mg p.o. q.d., aspirin 81 mg p.o. q.d.,
amiodarone 200 mg p.o. b.i.d.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Stomach cancer.  History of rheumatoid
arthritis and coronary artery disease.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Ex-tobacco use, quit approximately 40 years
ago.  No alcohol use.  Used to work for the telephone
company.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission vital signs were
temperature of 98.7, heart rate 115, blood pressure 114/60,
oxygen saturation 98% on 2 liters nasal cannula.  In general,
an elderly male in no apparent distress.  HEENT PERRL, EOMI,
MM dry, OP clear, poor dentition.  Neck normal carotid
upstroke, bounding carotid pulses, engorged EJV with JVD up
to 10 cm, no thyromegaly, no lymphadenopathy.  Chest diffuse
expiratory wheezes plus rales left greater than right half
way up lung fields.  Heart tachycardiac, regular, [**4-6**]
holosystolic murmur heard best at the left lower sternal
border, left ventricular heave.  Abdomen colostomy in place
without erythema, soft midline scar well healed, bowel sounds
positive.  Extremities positive cyanosis bilateral lower
extremities, dopplerable pulses, 2 to 3+ pitting edema up to
mid-shin, no clubbing.  Neuro alert and oriented times three,
grossly intact.

LABORATORY DATA:  On admission white blood cell count 6.1,
hematocrit 37.4, platelets 163.  Sodium 137, potassium 4.9,
chloride 99, CO2 20, BUN 103, creatinine 3.9, glucose 138.
Magnesium 2.7, phosphate 5.4, calcium 9.4, albumin 3.4.  ALT
36, AST 29, LK 294, LDH 352.  CK 186, MB 7, troponin 0.08.
Urinalysis was clean.  EKG was v-paced with 100% capture rate
of 115 with magnet rate of 60, sinus tachycardia with left
bundle branch block.  Chest x-ray showed cardiomegaly with
preserved redistribution, no infiltrates, blunting of
costophrenic angle on right.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  Cardiac:
A.  Ischemia.  The patient was ruled out for myocardial
infarction.  There were no ischemic issues during this
hospitalization.

B.  Pump.  The patient arrived in congestive heart failure
exacerbation.  He was unable to be adequately managed with
Lasix and Bumex and required Natrecor for adequate diuresis.
Patient diuresed well.  We were able to continue his beta
blocker, aspirin and statin as well as his ACE inhibitor.
His ACE inhibitor was switched from captopril to lisinopril
for more convenient once daily dosing.

C.  Rhythm.  The patient was found to be in a-fib on
admission.  An echo to evaluate for possible cardioversion
showed an apical thrombus, thus, cardioversion was
contraindicated.  He was started on heparin and Coumadin for
this thrombus with an INR goal of 2 to 3.  Heparin was
discontinued prior to discharge when this goal was reached.
EP was also consulted and recommended discontinuation of
amiodarone as atrial fibrillation had occurred while on this
medication.  In addition, low dose digoxin was added for
further rate control and augmentation of cardiac output.

2.  Renal.  The patient came in in acute on chronic renal
failure.  This was felt to be secondary to heart failure
exacerbation with pre-renal failure.  Creatinine peaked at
4.2 well above baseline of approximately 2.5.  This then
subsequently decreased to approximately 2.8 where it stayed
for the remainder of the hospitalization and on discharge.

3.  Of note, during attempted placement of a right subclavian
line, a large hematoma of his neck formed with tracheal
compression.  Otolaryngology was consulted and did not feel
there was a risk of airway compromise.  The hematoma slowly
improved without further management.

4.  GI.  Protonix was continued throughout hospitalization.
There were no GI issues.

5.  Heme.  The patient was started on Coumadin for atrial
fibrillation with apical thrombus.  In addition, his
hematocrit declined and he needed to be transfused during the
hospitalization to maintain hematocrit above 28 as he has
known heart failure and coronary artery disease.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  The patient was discharged to acute rehab
as he was significantly decompensated from this
hospitalization and heart failure exacerbation.

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:  During rehab at home he should
closely follow his 2 gm sodium diet and fluid restriction to
less than 2 liters per day as well as he should weigh himself
daily and if there is a gain of greater than 1 kg or any new
shortness of breath or increased lower extremity edema, his
cardiologist or PCP should be [**Name (NI) 653**] immediately for
management to reduce the risk of further congestive heart
failure exacerbation requiring hospitalization.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d.
2.  Protonix 40 mg p.o. q.d.
3.  Sublingual nitroglycerin 0.3 mg p.r.n.
4.  Lipitor 40 mg p.o. q.d.
5.  Digoxin 0.125 mg p.o. q.d.
6.  Epoetin alfa 5000 units subcu q.week.
7.  Toprol XL 100 mg p.o. q.d.
8.  Lisinopril 5 mg p.o. q.d.
9.  Warfarin 3 mg p.o. q.h.s.
10. Glipizide 2.5 mg p.o. q.d.
11. Salmeterol inhaler one to two puffs b.i.d.
12. Lasix 40 mg p.o. q.d.
13. Trazodone 50 mg p.o. q.h.s. p.r.n.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  CHF exacerbation.
2.  Atrial fibrillation.
3.  Apical thrombus.
4.  Acute on chronic renal failure.
5.  Diabetes type 2.
6.  COPD.
7.  Coronary artery disease.
8.  Peripheral vascular disease.
9.  Anemia thought to be secondary to renal failure.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  He was discharged in stable
condition to rehab.
