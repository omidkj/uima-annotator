Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 21731**]
Chief Complaint:
Fevers

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Transesophageal [**First Name3 (LF) **]


History of Present Illness:
   Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 52yo M with Crohn's disease s/p multiple
surgeries with resultant short gut syndrome and TPN dependency
who was recently admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] for evaluation of low grade
fevers. The pt has a history of multiple line infections, MV
endocarditis and osteomyelitis for which the pt is on chronic
vancomycin.  The pt initially presented to the ED on [**2196-4-21**] at
which time he was started empirically on levofloxacin and sent
home.  Fevers continued at home and the pt was subsequently
admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2196-4-26**] with Tmax of 102 in the ED.  Of
note, the pt also had elevated LFT but with normal US and normal
ERCP. The pt was placed on unasyn with gradual reduction in
fever curve.  At the time, an extensive workup was performed,
however the pt was discharged with continuing low grade fevers.
The pt was discharged on [**2196-4-29**] with continuing low grade
temperatures.
   Since his discharge from [**Hospital1 18**], the pt reports continual low
grade fevers.  The pt has a 24hour RN service who had recorded a
Tmax of 102 this AM as well as sx of disorientation.  The pt
admits to fevers as above but denies any chills, rigors, night
sweats, chest pain, palpitations, abd pain, n/v, head ache,
photophobia, neck stiffness.  The pt admits to chronic diarrhea
secondary to his short gut syndrome but there has not been any
change in his stool frequency or characteristic.  The pt does
report orthopnea and some LE edema which has been ongoing for
over one year.  The pt does report some mild weight gain over
the course of the last couple of months but no change in his
appetite.  The pt denies any heat or cold intolerance, or
flushing.
   In the ED, the blood cultures were drawn, UA and urine
cultures were sent and a CXR was performed.  LFT and ESR was
added on.  A TTE and CT scan of the chest, abd and pelvis was
also performed.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 52yo M with Crohn's disease s'p multiple surgeries
complicated by shortgut syndrome and dependency on TPN with hx
of multiple line infections, endocarditis and osteomyelitis.
.
1.  Fever: Initially felt to be septic with SBP in 90's.
Cultures were initially negative, clear CXR, fungal cx negative.
TEE was performed which showed reappearance of MV [**Month/Day (4) **] and
worsening MR. [**Name13 (STitle) **] was started on daptomycin, ambisome. Then found
to have fungal elements on blood smear, and then had a fungal
culture consistent with malassezia furfur. In addition gram +
cocci seen on the same blood smear and Staph epi grew out of 1
culture. Further identification is pending to determine if it is
a contaminant of the same organism that was present in his
osteomyelitis.Initially had wanted to have his Hickman pulled,
but per IR this would be a very difficult and involved procedure
and they prefer to treat through the line if possible. After ID
conference discussion plan is to treat with ambisome 3mg/kg IV
daily for 6 weeks, daptomycin 400 mg IV daily for 10 more days,
then transisiton to vancomycin 1g IV qod ongoing. He will need
to have f/u fungal cx with lipid supplemented media after 6
weeks to document clearance.

A).  Cards: The pt has a history of endocarditis for which he
has previously undergone medical treatment.  Given the
dependency on TPN, the pt is at significant risk for possible
endocarditis, especially with fungal organisms.  TEE showed
slightly worsened MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 16169**] MV [**Last Name (Titles) **]. Will plan 6
weeks ambisome with f/u cx. Daptomycin 400 mg IV daily for 10
more days, then vancomycin 1g IV qod. Had initially been
diuresed for CHF, now euvolemic.
.
B).  Pulm: The fever is unlikely to be due to a pulmonary source
given his lack of focal signs or symptoms including lack of
cough, sputum.  Initialy appeared in CHF after transfer out of
[**Hospital Unit Name 153**]. Diuresed well, now euvolemic.
.
C).  GI/Liver: Patient's Crohn's disease appears to be stable,
without evidence of a hepatobiliary source by LFTs. No abdominal
pain, and able to take some pos.
.
D).  Musculoskeletal: The pt has a known history of
osteomyelitis for which he is on chronic treatment with
vancomycin QOD (which is an unusual dose given his creatine
clearance would suggest a once daily to [**Hospital1 **] dosing). No neck or
back pain.
.
E).  Lines: As stated above, the pt has an existing Hickman
catheter for his TPN and history of multiple line infections.
Will hold off on pulling Hickman at this time and will need to
be pulled if fungal BCx comes back positive after 6 weeks.
.
4.  Renal: The pt has a history of CKD with creatinine baseline
in 1.2 range, now elevated at 1.8, looks dry on exam, giving IVF
now, will recheck chem 10 tomorrow, K elevated at 5.9 [**5-13**],
giving IVF and recheck today. Will need to have potassium free
TPN on discharge and repeat chem 10 [**5-14**].
.
5.  FEN: low salt diet, replete electrolyts with cautions.
.
6.  PPx: heparin sub Q TID for DVT prophylaxis, protonix for GI
ppx.  Pt does not need bowel regimen given his chronic diarrhea.
.
