History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 62 year0old male well-known to the transplant
surgery service recently discharged home on [**2157-1-15**]. His most
recent admission for management of his anticoagulation with a
supratherapeutic INR to 6.3. He had an orthotopic liver
transplant [**2156-12-8**] complicated post-operatively by a NSTEMI
where he underwent a failed cardiac catheterization on [**2156-12-27**].

He was discharged [**2156-12-29**] and returned on [**2157-1-1**] with
continued chest pain.  During that hospitalization was
emergently taken to the operating room with peritonitis and
where he underwent a exploratory laparotomy, drainage
intra-abdominal abscess, resection necrotic distal common bile
duct and
hepaticocholedochojejunostomy on [**2157-1-3**]. His postoperative
course was complicated by an episode of atiral fibrillation with
spontaneous cardioversion on a diltiazem drip.  On [**2157-1-7**] he
underwent a cholangiogram which demonstrated mild stenosis at
the hepaticojejunostomy anastamosis with mild left greater than
right intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation and mild delay of
contrast passage into jejunal loops with no evidence of biliary
leak.  He was discharged home on [**2157-1-10**] on anticoagulation for
atrial
fibrillation.
.
Today, he presents with diffuse abdominal pain that progressed
tonight approximately 11PM associated with shortness of breath
and chest pain.  The chest pain was similar to what he has
previously experienced, however, the diffuse abdominal pain is
new onset, not localized, associated with increased abdominal
girth, and difficulty with urination.  He reports he has had
intermittent shortness-of-breath since yesterday afternoon but
has significantly worsened tonight.

Brief Hospital Course:
62 y/o male s/p liver transplant and cardiac history who
presented with shortness of breath and diffuse abdominal pain.
He had an episode of rapid AFib in the ER and was given IV
Lopressor. He was transferred to the SICU and was placed on an
Esmolol drip.
Tube cholangiogram was performed: which demonstrated mild stasis
of contrast through the hepaticojejunostomy anastomosis site and
mild dilatation of the intrahepatic biliary ducts. There was no
evidence of biliary leak.
He also underwent U/S guided paracentesis for  small to moderate
ascites found on U/S. Fluid drained was found to have WBC: 1750
RBC: [**Numeric Identifier 2249**] Diff P:66 L:13 Macrophage:21  Culture showed 4+ PMNs
without any bacteria noted. Cultures were negative. A repeat
diagnostic tap was negative. Blood and urine cultures were
negative.  Vanco and Zosyn were started empirically.
Cardiac consultation occurred throughout the remainder of his
hospital stay as he was transferred in and out of the SICU
several times for recurring afib necessitating an Esmolol drip.
Lopressor was increased to 100 tid and amiodarone was increased
to 400mg [**Hospital1 **] with an extra loading dose of 400mg on [**1-27**].
Recommendations included decreasing the amiodarone to qd after a
week. Rhythm converted to sinus with HRs in the 50-52 range with
a SBP range of 94-107. He denied lightheadedness, CP, SOB and
nausea.

PT declared him safe for discharge home.

A PICC line was inserted on [**1-21**] in anticipation of the necessity
of continuing IV antibiotics. The patient had self d/c'd this
line. This was replaced oon [**1-26**]. A portable cxr demonstrated
placement in the SVC. There was some improvement in the
pulmonary edema noted on previous CXRs and there was a L pleural
effusion.

Coumadin 0.5mg qd was resumed. INR was 2.3 on [**1-27**]. [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] of
