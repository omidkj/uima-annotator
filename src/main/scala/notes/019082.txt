History of Present Illness:
This is a 67 yo M presenting with multiple medical problems
including severe MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 8813**] stenosis, who presents with
worsening DOE. He was recently hospitalized at [**Hospital1 18**] from [**3-8**] to
[**3-15**] for bilateral lower lobe PNA's, and during that hospital
course, he was found to have worsening severe MR (4+ with
partial flail leaflet and possible cord prolapse). His [**Month/Day (4) 8813**]
stenosis had a valve area of 0.8. He was also cathed and was
found to have 3VD not amenable to PCI. In the acute setting of
fevers/PNA, CT surgery was deferred until outpatient setting. He
did undergo thoracentesis of his pleural effusion on that
admission which was transudative. He was treated with a 7 day
course of CTX/azithro for the PNA. He was discharged on [**3-15**] and
was to follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2230**] in CT surgery for CABG/MVR/?AVR.
He got surveillance cultures subsequent to discharge that have
been negative to date. However, he was readmitted from [**Date range (1) 6098**]
with fever, diarrhea, and cough, and was found to be
hypotensive. He was treated empirically for C diff despite 3
negative stool toxin A assays. He was briefly on pressors in the
ICU. All stool cultures to date have been negative for C diff,
and pt is to complete his course of flagyl on [**2113-4-6**].
.
He states that beginning yesterday, he noted worsening DOE.
Normally he is able to walk many blocks without becoming SOB,
but yesterday he was quite exhausted even climbing the stairs to
his house. He also noted a 5 lb weight gain and paroxysmal
nocturnal dyspnea. However, denies worsening LE edema or new
orthopnea. No CP. Defintiely feels more lethargic and weaker
than usual. No F/C/night sweats, no N/V. His diarrhea has
completely resolved. Denies unual salt intake and has been
taking his medicines religiously. He called Dr.[**Name (NI) 77980**] office
who prescribed lasix 20mg po daily x 2 days. He noted no benefit
from this and so was advised to present to the ED.
.
In the ED, intial vitals were 98.3, 90, 117/83, 20, 97% RA. CXR
was read as stable cardiomegaly with no acute intrathoracic
pathology. EKG was unchanged from prior. Labs revealed slightly
elevated creatinine of 1.2 (b/l 0.9-1.1), and a proBNP of 4475
(up from 3587 on [**2113-3-8**]). 2 sets of cardiac enzymes were
negative. Cardiac Surgery was consulted for evaluation and
recommended admission to [**Hospital Unit Name 196**] for management of SOB.

Pertinent Results:
[**4-6**] Echo: PRE-BYPASS: The left atrium is moderately dilated. The
left atrium is elongated. No spontaneous echo contrast or
thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium or left atrial
appendage. Mild spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body of
the right atrium. The right ventricular cavity is moderately
dilated with mild global free wall hypokinesis. There is mild
tricuspid regurgitation. The [**Month/Day (4) 8813**] valve leaflets are
moderately thickened. There is moderate [**Month/Day (4) 8813**] valve stenosis
(area 1.0-1.2cm2) by planimetry and continuity equation c/w low
gradient AS. No Dobutamine stress test was done as it was
already done in the cath [**Month/Day (4) **] with the [**Location (un) 109**] going up to 1.67cm2.
Trace [**Location (un) 8813**] regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets
are mildly thickened. There is partial mitral leaflet flail at
the P2 region. Anterior leaflet looks normal. There is an
eccentric jet c/w with Moderate to severe (3+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is a moderate sized pericardial
effusion. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in person of the results
[**First Name9 (NamePattern2) 77981**] [**Known lastname **] at 8AM in the OR before surgery start.
POST-BYPASS: Patient is on milrinone 0.25mcg/kg/min, levophed
0.07 mcg/kg/min, epinephrine 0.03 mcg/kg/min RV has moderate
systolic dysfunction. Mild to moderate TR. LVEF is 35 ro 40%.
There is a mechanical prosthesis in the mitral position well
positioned with a mean gradient of 2mm of HG. The prosthesis is
stable and functioning well. There is a mechanical prosthesis in
the [**Known lastname 8813**] position well seated and a peak of 20mm of HG. There
are no pathological leaks in both the prosthesis.
Thoracic [**Known lastname 8813**] contour is intact.
[**4-15**] CXR: Small right pleural effusion has decreased
substantially, left pleural effusion nearly resolved since [**4-7**]. Mild-to-moderate enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is
stable postoperatively. Aside from mild bibasilar atelectasis,
lungs are clear. No pneumothorax.

Brief Hospital Course:
As mentioned in the HPI, Mr. [**Known lastname **] presented to the ED c/o
worsening DOE. He was admitted under the cardiology service for
medical management. He was given vitamin K for an elevated INR
and continued on empiric Flagyl. He was seen by hepatology for
elevated transaminase and INR, and given more vitamin K for
vitamin K deficiency. He underwent an Echo on [**4-5**] which
revealed severe MR along with [**Month/Year (2) **] Stenosis. He was taken to
the operating room on [**4-6**] where he underwent a Coronary Artery
Bypass Graft x 1, Mitral and [**Month/Year (2) **] Valve Replacement. Please
see operative report for surgical details. Following surgery he
was transferred to the CVICU for invasive management in stable
condition. Within 24 hours he was weaned from sedation, awoke
neurologically intact and extubated. Post-
