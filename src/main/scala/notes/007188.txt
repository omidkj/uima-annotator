History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 41008**] is a 36 year old healthy male with recent travel to
[**Location (un) 13025**] [**Date range (1) 81624**] who was transferred from OSH with
altered mental status, fevers, and seizures. History was
originally obtained from family and medical records as patient
was intubated and sedated for inability to protect airway due to
AMS. According to family, patient had been in his USOH until
returning from [**Location (un) 13025**]. The day following his return, [**1-6**],
he developed high fevers, as high as 104, typically beginning in
the late afternoon and occurred daily. He had significant
chills, nightsweats, decreased appetite and po intake, and was
awakening at night with nightmares and talking in his sleep
which was atypical for him. He denied any HA, vision changes,
numbness, weakness, slurred speech, abdominal pain, nausea, or
vomiting. He did have one episode of diarrhea on [**1-18**]. While in
[**Location (un) 13025**] he did smoke various types of marijuana. He denied any
other illicit drugs or herbs when asked after extubation. His
family denies any significant animal exposures that they know
about and do not think he travelled outside the city of
[**Location (un) 13025**]. They did note that he was "not himself" saying he
wanted to "change his ways" after returning from [**Location (un) 13025**].
.
Several days after developing fevers he also developed a sore
throat and was given Amoxicillin by his PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**1-16**]. Strep
throat screen at that time was negative. On [**1-18**], he noted
severe chills as well as diarrhea above. His girlfriend left him
at home to go to work. He then apparently drove from [**Location (un) 5503**]
to Glouchester on [**1-18**]. He was pulled over by the police for
driving erratically and was then send to [**Hospital3 10310**]
Hospital after providing bizarre answers to police. According to
EMS who transported him, he could not answer any questions
appropriately. His BG in the field was 130.

LP which showed 6 WBCs, 18 RBCs, glucose = 73, TP = 47, Gram
stain pending, 86% lymphocytes on tube 1 on tube 4 0RBCs, 4
WBCs. He was started empirically on ceftriaxone and acyclovir
for possible ecephalitis. He was persistently febrile to 102. At
0500 am [**1-19**], he had a generalized tonic clonic seizure lating
45 seconds and desaturated to the low 80s. ABG at that time was
7.05/38/60. The patient was then intubated. CXR showed no
infiltrate. He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] ICU for further
evaluation and management.

EEG [**2175-1-20**]
ABNORMALITY #1: The background was slow and disorganized,
showing mixed
theta/delta frequency slowing reaching a [**6-15**] Hz maximum.
HYPERVENTILATION: Could not be performed.
INTERMITTENT PHOTIC STIMULATION: Could not be performed.
SLEEP: There were no normal waking or sleep morphologies seen.
CARDIAC: Showed a generally regular rhythm with a mild
tachycardia -
average rate of 96 bpm.
IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal EEG due to a slow background
indicative
of an encephalopthy affecting cortical and subcortical
structures.
Medications, metabolic disturbances, and infection are the most
common
causes. Nevertheless, there were no areas of focal slowing or
epil
