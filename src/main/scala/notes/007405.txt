Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3619**]
Chief Complaint:
dyspnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Bronchoscopy


History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 75-year-old woman with multifactorial pulmonary
disease including right-sided NSCLC s/p resection and
chemotherapy [**2132**], pulmonary MAC infection (currently on month
four of treatment), pulmonary hypertension, and radiation
pulmonary fibrosis who has chronic dyspnea.  She uses four
liters of oxygen by nasal cannula at baseline, and she
chronically participates in pulmonary rehab.  She was in her
USOH until five days ago, when she noted increased exertional
dyspnea.  (Although she had no new symptoms last week, she did
notice that she was more hypoxic than usual after exercising at
pulmonary rehab.)  This dyspnea progressed steadily until today,
when she found that she became dyspneic with minimal exertion
(e.g. brushing her teeth, eating).  She has not had any
associated symptoms; she denies fever, rigors, night sweats,
chest pain or tightness, increase in her baseline morning cough,
new cough or sputum production, wheezing, n/v, lower extremity
swelling, or pain of any kind (including jaw, arm, neck, or
back).

She stopped taking Revatio earlier this week in the setting of
her progressive dyspnea.  She came to the ED today, where she
was found to have new abnormalities on her chest CT as noted
below.  She was given ceftriaxone 1 gram and admitted.

She has had anorexia and an associated ten-pound weight loss
since beginning her MAC medications four months ago.  She has
felt some pressure along the waist of her pants when sitting
upright for the past week, but otherwise has not noticed any
change in the way her clothes fit.  She had transient
palpitations six days ago.  Her ROS is otherwise negative in
detail.  She denies headaches, visual changes, blurred vision,
diplopia, rhinorrhea, sore throat, ear pain, new ear fullness,
odynophagia, dysphagia, abdominal pain, diarrhea, constipation,
rectal bleeding, melena, hematuria, dysuria, myalgias,
arthralgias, or rash.

Past Medical History:
1.  Stage IIIa T2N2 non-small cell right lower lobe lung cancer
resected [**10-20**].  Treated with three cycles of carboplatin and
Taxol and concurrent radiotherapy.  [**1-22**] CT showed a RML
consolidation with effusion; PET-CT showed increased PET
avidity.  Cytology and cultures from a CT-guided aspiration of
this consolidation were negative.
2.  Pulmonary MAC Infection:  [**7-22**] CT showed progressive
cavitation in the right lower lung field along with atelectasis
and bronchiectasis.  Cytology from an [**8-22**] bronchoscopy was
negative; no cultures were sent.  [**8-22**] and [**12-22**] sputum cultures
grew MAC.  Three-drug therapy (rifampin 600 mg 3x/wk, ethambutol
1200 mg 3x/wk, azithromycin 500 mg 3x/wk) was started [**2-24**].
3.  Right-sided breast cancer treated with lumpectomy and
radiation therapy in [**2111**].  Ductal carcinoma in situ was then
diagnosed in [**2132**] and was treated with lumpectomy alone.
4.  Tuberculosis at age 18 (10-month sanatorium stay; treated).
5.  GERD
6.  Anxiety
7.  Hypertension
8.  Benign thyroid nodule
9.  Secondary pulmonary hypertension
10.  Radiation pulmonary fibrosis
11.  Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation
12.  Pericardial effusion
13.  Depression
14.  Remote left knee surgery
[**43**].  Anemia
16.  Pneumonia
17.  Pericarditis
18.  Pericardial effusion c/b tamponade

Social History:
She lives with her husband and their pet dog.  She has no recent
known sick contacts.  She denies use or abuse of tobacco or
illicit drugs.  She has one alcoholic drink per week.

Family History:
Her mother had breast cancer.  Her father had [**Name2 (NI) 499**] cancer.

CXR:  Slightly increased right lower lung parenchymal opacities.
 Increased right-sided pleural effusion.  The left lung is
relatively
clear with a calcified granuloma at the apex is stable and
emphysematous
changes.

CT Chest with and without contrast:  No pulmonary embolism or
thoracic aortic dissection.  Stable thick-walled cavity in the
superior segment of the right lower lobe.  There is complete
opacification of the right middle lobe with multiple air
bronchograms.  The radiation fibrosis in the anterior segment of
left upper lobe is unchanged.  There has been interval
progression of the left lower lobe nodules (likely due to
bronchogenic spread of tumor > infection).

Brief Hospital Course:
75-year-old woman with multifactorial pulmonary disease (NSCLC,
pulmonary MAC infection, pulmonary hypertension, radiation
fibrosis) now with five days of progressive dyspnea and hypoxia
in the setting of a progressively abnormal chest CT scan.

1.  Dyspnea and Hypoxia:  Her CT scan shows significant RML
consolidation with air bronchograms suggestive of pneumonia vs.
collapse.  Although radiographically c/w pneumonia, she did not
have the fever, cough, or leukocytosis that would be expected of
typical pneumonia.  She is not known to be immunocompromised and
has not recently taken immunocompromising medications, so she
should not be at risk for infection with unusual pathogens. The
increased left-sided basilar nodules also raise concern for
recurrent malignancy.  She does have a history of tuberculosis,
but this is quite remote (sixty years ago) and her anti-MAC meds
have anti-tuberculous activity, so this diagnosis seems quite
unlikely.  Progressive MAC seems unlikely, although it cannot be
excluded; the [**1-24**] isolate that was tested was resistant to
rifampin, although synergistic testing showed intermediate
susceptibility to the combination of rifampin and ethambutol.
Her respiratory alkalosis is chronic, albeit slightly worse than
previously.  There is no evidence of recurrent pleural or
pericardial effusions on CT. She was started on ceftriaxone for
a community acquired pneumonia. She was also started on
doxycycline to treat atypical organisms that may now be
resistant to azithromycin given her current 3x/week dosing. She
underwent a bronchoscopy on [**2136-7-6**] which did not show any
intrabronchial obstruction. BAL samples were taken and were
negative for standard organisms, legionella, PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] AFB at the
time of this writing. Post bronchoscopy, she developed hypopnea
and worsening hypoxia, likely related to sedation used during
the procedure. She was initially stabilized with BiPAP and
transferred to the ICU for hypercapnic/hypoxic respiratory
failure. There she was rapidly weened back to her baseline 4L O2
by NC within 24 hours. She was transferred back to the OMED
service on [**2136-7-8**]. She was evaluated by PT and was able to
maintain her oxygen sats greater than 93% on 4 L NC.
She was discharged on Levaquin 500 mg PO daily x2 days to finish
her CAP coverage (QTc interval was checke
