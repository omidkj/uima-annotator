ADDENDUM:  Since the previous dictation, the patient has had
a video swallowing study which showed accumulation of bullous
in the vallecula.  The study was not continued for fear of
further accumulation in the vallecula, which could lead to
frank aspiration.  It was recommended that the patient be
kept on nothing by mouth and continue on tube feeds.  Speech
and swallow evaluation recommends that the patient have a
repeat video swallowing study in approximately one month.

The patient also had bilateral lower extremity venous
Dopplers.  There was concern at [**Hospital1 **] that the patient had
persistent hypoxia which may have been thought to persistent
pulmonary emboli.  There was no evidence of deep vein
thrombosis on bilateral lower extremity Doppler studies.

The patient had her Foley catheter changed and a repeat urine
showed 140 white blood cells and many yeast.  The patient was
started on Diflucan 200 mg orally/per G-tube times the first
day and then 100 mg daily times four days.

If there are any other changes to the [**Hospital 228**] hospital
course, another addendum will be added.
