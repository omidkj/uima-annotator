History of Present Illness:
55 year old woman s/p L4-L5 laminectomy and fusion on [**2172-4-7**],
discharged [**2172-4-12**], who presented to [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **], [**Hospital **] hospital with 3
days of SOB on [**2172-4-23**]. Pt states that she developed SOB three
days prior to admission. She denies CP, palpitations, but does
endorse DOE with recent difficulty reaching the top of her
stairs. Following dinner on [**4-22**] the pt developed worsening SOB
at rest and the pt called EMS. En route to hospital pt was
initally bradycardic, hypotensive and with low sats, BP improved
with non-rebreather and the pt became tachycardic in the low
100's. At OSH pt was given 3L NS and 1u pRBCs for tachycardia
and anemia (OSH hct 26), and pt had a CTA PE protocol that
revealed a large left main pulmonary artery PE extending to
segmental arteries involving all lobes of the left lung, as well
as a right upper lobe apical segmental artery PE, and an
occlusive embolus in the right lower lobe pulmonary artery. The
pt was started on a heparin gtt and transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] ED for
further management. ABG at OSH showed: 7.46/30/53/21.
.
In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, initial vs were: T 98.6 P 88 BP 135/88 R 28 O2
sat 91% NRB. Patient was given morphine and ondansetron and
heparin was continued. Patient was admitted to ICU for further
management.
.
On the floor, patient appears comfortable but tachypnic on NRB.
Reports that she is thirsty.
.
Review of systems:
(+) Per HPI
Also, patient endorses non-productive, non-bloody cough for
three days, constipation (no BM since she was discharged from
the hospital [**2172-4-12**]), and abdominal pain at the site of the
surgical incision.
.
(-) Denies fever, chills, night sweats, recent weight loss or
gain. Denies headache, sinus tenderness, rhinorrhea or
congestion. Denies Denies chest pain, chest pressure,
palpitations, or weakness. Denies nausea, vomiting, diarrhea.
Denies dysuria, frequency, or urgency. Denies arthralgias or
myalgias. Denies rashes or skin changes.

LE Ultrasound:
Grayscale and Doppler son[**Name (NI) **] of the bilateral common femoral,
superficial femoral, and popliteal veins were performed. Within
the right distal femoral vein, inferior to the bifurcation
(SFV), an echogenic clot is seen. Flow was seen around this
clot. The remaining vessels demonstrate normal compressibility,
flow and augmentation.

Outside Hospital CTA Scan:  massive b/l PE

TTE [**4-23**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular
wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic
function are normal (LVEF >55%). The right ventricular cavity is
dilated with mild global free wall hypokinesis. The number of
aortic valve leaflets cannot be determined. There is no aortic
valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral
regurgitation. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There
is no pericardial effusion.

CTA Chest [**4-30**]: IMPRESSION:
1. Minimally increase in large pulmonary artery clot burden on
the right
since 1 week prior. The pulmonary artery remains almost the same
diameter as the aorta suggesting mild pulmonary hypertension.
There are no other signs to suggest right ventricular strain.
2. Left upper lung ground glass opacities may represent
infectious etiology, asymmetric ventilation from pulmonary
embolus or foci of hemorrhage.
3. New small, left greater than right pleural effusions.
4. No RP bleed.
5. Small splenic infarct.


Brief Hospital Course:
55 y/o F with hx of gastric bypass and recent spinal fusion on
[**2172-4-7**] who presents with acute pulmonary embolism.

# Pulmonary embolism (provoked): Per reports from OSH, and per
discussion with radiologists at [**Hospital1 18**] and review of the images,
pt has diffuse PE's bilaterally, with very little lung
perfusion. Pt was started on oxygen and a heparin drip (with
which there was initially some difficulty in obtaining
therapeutic PTT) as well as coumadin. Upon admission she was on
a nonrebreather, but was weaned to facemask and then to nasal
cannula and, on discharge, was on room air during the day with
desaturations overnight requiring her to get home oxygen for
overnight only.
-could consider outpt sleep study
-pt discharged c therapeutic INR, will need close f/u

# s/p laminectomy (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 363**]: Midline incision healing well,
pt still having pain in abdomen, low back.  She was initially
controlled with IV pain medication, but transitioned back to her
home regimen of PO oxycontin and oxycodone.  Ortho recommended
A/P and lateral L-spine films during her admission.  These were
obtained and showed no change in alignment.
-pt to f/u with Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 363**] as outpt

# Pain Management s/p laminectomy: Midline incision healing
well, pt still having pain in abdomen, low back. Ortho is
following along.  Left back pain perhaps due to small splenic
infarct seen on chest CT. Pain service consulted. Tizanidine
continued. Started gabapentin and lidocaine patch.

# Depression/Anxiety:  Pt. was very tearful during admission as
she was not expecting this and has had tremendous stress at home
(her son is in prison).  Social work was consulted for support.
Home anxiety regimen continued. Seroquel increased to 50 qhs. Pt
able to discuss her anxiety and depression at length with this
provider. [**Name10 (NameIs) **] also states that she has never considered hurting
herself and that she believes she is here for a reason.

# splenic infact: unclear etiology
-recommend outpt heme eval

# anemia: iron studies c/w iron deficiency plus anemia of
chronic inflammation. Would recommend starting iron when pt on
less opiates (pt had issues c constipation during
hospitalization, did not want to start iron at this time).
- recommend start iron as outpt
