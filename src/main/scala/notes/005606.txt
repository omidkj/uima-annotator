History of Present Illness:
55 y/o M with CAD s/p stents, [**Hospital 23051**] transferred from [**Hospital1 9191**] after hypoxia and PEA arrest. Per family, the patient
was driving at 2am to pick up his daughter. [**Name (NI) **] en route, he
stopped by the side of the road to urinate. While urinating he
became incontinent of stool, and developed acute onset of
dyspnea, and fell to the ground. ststing " I can't breathe and I
feel like I'm going to die". EMS was called. BS 276 in the
field.  Per family report, while being transported to [**Hospital1 **] the
patient arrested and was resucitated by EMS. However, there was
no documentation of this in EMS log.  Rhythm strip from
ambulance showed  ST depressions V3-V5. No evidence of
hyperkalemia on EKG, PR and QTc within normal limits.   Pt was
tachycardiac to 117 with sat of 80-87% on 100% NRB.
.
On arrival to the OSH,  he was bradycardic at 40, O2 75%,
underwent CPR for two minutes, epinephrine X2, atropine 1 amp
X1, HCO3 2 amps. Post arrest his HR was in the 120's and blood
pressure in the 140s, and he was placed on nitro gtt.  At [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] his ekg showed anterolateral ST depressions, in setting of
hyperkalemia and respiratory acidosis. CXR showed fluid overload
and he was given 40mg lasix IV. BNP 97.  Initial blood gas at
OSH, 6.87/73/76 satting 100% on NRB.  Repeast [**Doctor Last Name **] 50 minutes
later 6.91/88/95 now intubated.  UA negative He was transferred
to [**Hospital1 18**] ED because apparently his records are here.
.
In the ED here vitals were: 123 117/87 100% on FiO2 100%.
EKG showed sinus tachycardia with rightward axis, st depressions
in I, V3-V5. CT head was normal, CTA torso was remarkable for
large bilateral aspirations but no PE or aortic dissection.
Cards was consulted in the ED and felt ekg changes were likely
secondary to hypoxia and acidemia, and given no evidence STEMI,
VF, or VT, cath was not indicated at this time and MICU
admission was appropriate. Labs showed K of 6.8, lactate of 3.3.
 He was given vancomycin and zosyn. He was started on the arctic
sun cooling protocol as well, and transferred to the MICU.
.
In the MICU, patient's CK and troponin continued to rise.  ECHO
showed severaly depressed EF of 20%, both left and right
ventricular dilitation, and inferolateral akinesis and mid to
distal anteroseptal and apical akinesis with hypokinesis
elsewhere.

CTA Chest [**2164-5-1**] - . No evidence of aortic dissection or
pulmonary embolism. 2. Bilateral lower lobe consolidation,
suggestive of massive aspiration. 3. Fatty liver. 4. Right
adrenal nodule, likely adrenal adenoma

CT Head [**2164-5-1**] - No acute ICH

ECHO [**2164-5-1**] - The left ventricular cavity is dilated. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF=
20 %) with inferolateral akinesis and mid to distal anteroseptal
and apical akinesis with hypokinesis elsewhere. The right
ventricular cavity is dilated with mild global free wall
hypokinesis. The aortic valve is not well seen. There is no
aortic valve stenosis. The mitral valve leaflets are
structurally normal. No mitral regurgitation is seen. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. There is at least mild
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension

Bilateral Lower Extremity Doppler US [**2164-5-2**] - No evidence of
DVT in the lower extremities bilaterally

Cardiac Cath [**2164-5-4**] - 1. Coronary angiography in this right
dominant system demonstrated left main and three vessel CAD. The
LMCA had an ostial 60% stenosis and diffuse mild narrowing. The
LAD had diffuse 80% proximal and mid stenoses and 60% mid-distal
stenosis. The LCx had a diffuse 99% stenosis that tracked back
to the LMCA. The RCA had a mid 60% stenosis.
2. Limited resting hemodynamics revealed normal systemic
arterial blood
pressure with SBP 114mmHg and DBP 73mmHg.


Brief Hospital Course:
55M who was admitted with PEA arrest and NSTEMI. He was
successfully cooled with the Arctic Sun and extubated with
return
of excellent mental status. Echo showed biventricular
dilatation and EF 20% with multiple wall motion abnormalities.
Cath revealed severe three vessel coronary artery disease.  He
is
on broad spectrum antibiotics for aspiration pneumonia, which
improved significantly within 2-3 days.
