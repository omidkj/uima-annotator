Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2186**]
Chief Complaint:
Fevers, early sepsis

Major [**First Name3 (LF) 2947**] or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
64 year old male with history of CVA (non-verbal at baseline),
multiple pneumonias (s/p trach/PEG [**3-/2200**]), atrial fibrillation
on coumadin, CDiff s/p colectomy, type 2 diabetes mellitus,
peripheral vascular disease and recent admission for
UTI/?multifocal pneumonia who presents with fevers to 101.9. The
patient initially presented to the hospital for routine G-tube
replacement but had with the fever and ?blood suctioned from old
G-tube, was sent to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED. The patient also has erythema
around the G-tube site and minimal ostomy output.
.
The patient was most recently admitted 5/11-17/[**2200**] for UTI
(Proteus mirabilis, previous Providencia stuartii) and fevers
which was treated w/ Cefepime. The patient has a chronic
indwelling Foley. The patient also had a potential pneumonia
(?aspiration) on CXR with sputum culture growing out
Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Serratia marcescens, Proteus
mirabilis and was treated with Tobramycin and Vancomycin. The
patient had ongoing issues with blood leaking from his trach
site last admission as well, which resolved without
intervention, ?trach site or oropharyngeal trauma/bleed.
.
In the ED, initial vitals were: T99.9, HR83, BP115/67, RR14, 91%
on ?trach mask. The patient is nonverbal at baseline but
endorsed pain and following commands. His blood pressures
gradually drifted to SBP96. He was noted to have active
bronchospasms, so respiratory therapy evaluated the patient. He
received albuterol neb X1, mucomyst 20% 30 mL X1, Vancomycin IV
1 gram X1 and Zosyn IV 4.5mg X1, Tobramycin 520mg X1, Morphine
4mg IV X1. Bronchospasms resolved and the patient was satting
100% on 35% humidified air via trach mask. Two large bore IV
were placed and fluid boluses given as well. CXR showed possible
new LLL infiltrate. CT abdomen/pelvis with contrast showed no
intrabdominal process, likely multi-focal pneumonia. Labs
notable for new leukocytosis to WBC 30.4. Blood and urine
cultures sent. Urinalysis shows mild urinary tract infection.
The patient also received one dose of Flagyl 500mg IV X1.
Lactate 1.3.
Upon transfer, vital signs were: Afebrile, BP115/75, HR66, RR
12-13 (7 and shallow when sleeping), 100% O2 sat on 35%
facemask.
.
ROS: Patient denies shortness of breath, endorses pain in RUE
and ?lower back. Otherwise, denies complaints but difficult to
assess.

CT abdomen/pelvis with contrast:
1. Multifocal ground-glass opacities and consolidation with air
bronchograms worrisome for either multifocal pneumonia or
aspiration.
2. Gastrojejunostomy tube in appropriate position with the
distal tip within the jejunum. No evidence of any peri-catheter
leakage or extraluminal contrast collections.
.
CXR: Along with the patchy opacity noted at the
left lung base on the prior study, there is now a right basilar
opacity. These could reflect confluent edema, atelectasis,
aspiration, or pneumonia from other source, or a combination
thereof. There is superimposed mild interstitial edema as well.

Brief Hospital Course:
64 year old male with history of CVA (non-verbal at baseline),
multiple pneumonias (s/p trach/PEG [**3-/2200**]), atrial fibrillation
on coumadin, CDiff s/p colectomy, type 2 diabetes mellitus,
peripheral vascular disease and recent admission for
UTI/?multifocal pneumonia who presents with fevers to 101.9.
.
# Pneumonia: CXR suggestive of PNA in bilateral lower lobes. He
was given vanco/zosyn/levoflox/tobramycin, (in past, sputum grew
stenotrophomonas). His zosyn was d/c-ed and transitioned to
cefepime; tobramycin was also d/c-ed. He was initialy transfered
to the unit for close monitoring. Had mini-BAL which showed
10-100,000 colonies GNR. This eventually speciated PSEUDOMONAS
AERUGINOSA, SERRATIA MARCESCENS, PSEUDOMONAS AERUGINOSA, and
antibiotic coverage was narrowed from Cefepime and Levofloxacin
to levofloxacin.
- Patient should receive a total of 14 days course of
levofloxacin.

#G-tube: patient was initially brought here for Gtube
replacement, which was performed and tube feeds were restarted
without complications.

#. C diff s/p colectomy: Patient has history of C diff in the
past, and according to [**Hospital1 1501**] records last admission, was most
recently positive [**2200-5-20**], treated with PO Vancomycin. Given
recent antibiosis and significantly elevated WBC, concern for
CDiff despite anatomy. It was doubtful that the patient had a
repeat infection given negative Cdiff and lack of colon. Oral
vancomycin was discontinued.
.
# Atrial fibrillation: On coumadin.
- Please check INR [**5-20**] and adjust coumadin as needed for
therapeutic INR [**1-22**]
.
# Sacral decubitus ulcer (stage 2): Wound care consult
.
# Hypothyroidism: Last TSH checked in OMR is 6/[**2199**]. Likely not
contributing to current issues. Check TSH (caveat, sick
euthyroid) and continued home levothyroxine dose.
.
# Tyle 2 diabetes mellitus: Stable. Also with history of
peripheral neur
