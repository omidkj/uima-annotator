that she had the sudden onset of severe SSCP associated with SOB
last night. The pain began last night.
Associated w/ nausea, vomiting x2 (non-bloody).

R pubic ramus fracture and R humerus fx [**1-26**] fall sustained [**10-30**]



Social History:
Lives with daughter. Denies history of etoh, tobacco. Prior to
fall from chair one month ago was independent for ADLs.

Family History:

of unknown etiology.

Regular s1,s2. IV/VI SEM, radiating throughout the precordium
b/l rales to [**1-27**] lung height.
+bs. soft. nt. nd.
no le edema.


Pertinent Results:
ecg (OSH): 2mm ST elevation in III, 1mm in F. STd in I/L, and
V3-V6.
subsequent ecg in house shows resolution of STe, but remaining
depressions. Follow up on MICU admission shows resolution of
lateral changes, new Qws inferiorly and hyperacute Tws.
.
[**12-15**] TTE: Severely depressed LVEF with regionality c/w CAD.
Severe mitral regurgitation. Moderate pulmonary hypertension.
.
[**12-15**] CT chest/abd:
1. No evidence of aortic dissection, aneurysmal dilatation, or
pulmonary embolism. Bilateral pleural effusions with perihilar
edema and interstitial edema are suggestive of underlying
congestive heart failure.
2. Multiple thoracic wedge compression fractures of uncertain
chronicity and probable nonacute right humeral surgical neck
fracture. Recommend correlation to clinical exam and if acute
fracture is suspected, dedicated imaging to this region.
3. Diffuse coronary and vascular calcifications.
4. Noncalcified sub 5 mm right lower lobe pulmonary nodule.
Given patient's age followup is probably not needed, however, if
clinically indicated, a repeat scan in one year may be ordered
to assess stability if patient has no known primary malignancy.

5. Cholelithiasis without evidence of cholecystitis.
.
[**12-15**] CXR: Probable CHF with pulmonary edema and/or associated
multilobar pneumonia. Incidental note of fracture of neck of
right humerus.
.
Cardiac cath:  1. Selective coronary angiography of this heavily
calcified right dominant system revealed diffuse severe three
vessel and mild-moderate left main disease. The LMCA was heavily
calcified with ostial 30-40% and distal 40% stenoses.  The LAD
had diffuse disease with a proximal-mid 80% lesion after a
small-caliber D1 branch (which itself was subtotally occluded
proximally prior to a bifrucation). A long D2 had a proximal
subtotal occlusion.  The mid LAD had an 80% lesion involving D3
followed by an aneurysm with diffuse disease in a long distal
LAD. Septal
collaterals supplied the RPDA. The LCX had an ostial 40% lesion,
a
proximal 80% lesion, a modest AV groove vessel with mid 50% and
distal
80% lesions before LPLs. Distal collaterals supplied the RPL
system. The
major OM had an aneurysmal bifurcation lesion with 80% stenosis
into the
lower pole. The RCA had a proximal 60-70% lesion and then was
totally
occluded after the conus and atrial branches with only faint
filling of
acute marginal branches via vasa collaterals; the mid-distal RCA
filled
only retrogradely via left-to-right collaterals.
  2. Resting hemodynamics revealed mild pulmonary hyptertension
with PA
pressures 38/14 mmHg. The mean PCW was slightly elevated at 12
mmHg.
Cardiac index was low normal at 2.75 L/min/m2 (based on an
assumed
oxygen consumption). Although the systemic arterial saturation
was low
on 4 L/min NC, it rose appropriately with higher concentration
oxygen
therapy, arguing against significant right-to-left shunting.
  3. Left femoral vascular access was utilized due to a right
pelvic
fracture. The left common femoral artery was calcified. The
patient had
a heavily calcified and tortuous left common iliac artery
looping into
the abdominal aorta (traversed using a Magic Torque wire and a
[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]
[**Last Name (un) 2493**]-Tip introducing sheath).
  4. Left ventriculography was not performed.
.
pelvic Xray:
Evidence of remote trauma involving the right inferior pubic
ramus.  No acute fracture seen.
.

Na 136, K 4.5, bicarb 28, BUN 19. Cr 1.0,

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: [**Age over 90 **] yo f w/ inf STEMI and subsequent pulmonary edema, 4+MR,
and hypotension.
.
1) CV:
A. Coronaries: pt presented with inf STEMI.  Cardiac
cathterization showed severe diffuse three vessel and
mild-moderate left main coronary artery disease; these lesions
were not ammenable to stenting or CABG. She was medically with
heparin gtt x48h, asa 325, plavix 75 QD, lipitor at 40.  She
tolerated metoprolol XL at 75mg daily.  She developed
hypotension with both imdur and lisinopril (which were stopped).
 Her outpatient cardiologist/PCP should restart lisinopril if
her BP can tolerate.
.
B. pump: Ms [**Known lastname **] has left ventricular dysfunction and CHF with
EF 25-30%. She also has papillary muscle dysfunction with 4+ MR,
2+TR. She has had persistant pulmonary edema on exam (L>R) but
this has improved over her course.  She was on aldactone for
class III-VI heart failure but this was discontinued due to poor
po intake and hypotension.
.
C. Rhythm: Ms [**Known lastname **] had no ectopy on telemetry
.
2) hypotension- Ms [**Known lastname **] has been periodically hypotense inhouse
likely [**1-26**] combination of volume depletion in the setting of
severe mitral regurg. She was briefly on levophed which was
d/c'd and she was able to be started on BB.
.
4) pelvis fracture- Ms [**Known lastname **] has a pelivic XR showing remote
trauma of R inf pelvic ramus.  She also has an old RUE humerus
fx s/p sling. ortho was consulted and did not rec any further
imaging or treatment as fx was old.  She was started on lovenox
for anticoag given her pelvic fracture.  She should WBAT with a
walker and limit WB to 10lbs of RUE.
.
5) renal insufficiency- Ms [**Known lastname **]' Cr has ranged between 0.7 and
1.1 largely secondary to very poor po intake and dehydration.-
encourage PO intake
.
6) fen- cardiac diet; very poor po intake [**1-26**] decreased
appetite.
.
8) ppx: senna, pantoprazole, lovenox
.
9) full code- confirmed with patient on [**12-17**]
