Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 17865**]
Chief Complaint:
Hyperkalemia, shortness of breath.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None.

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 76867**] is a very nice 22-year-old woman with MPGN
s/p renal transplant ([**7-12**]) and recurrent MPGN with removal of
transplanted kidney on [**2179-7-7**] who was on PD until [**2181-3-22**] when
she developed peritonitis and recently started on HD who comes
with chest pain and shortness of breath. She was in her usual
state of health until today around 8:00 AM when she woke up and
started with sudden dull retro-sternal chest pain [**7-17**] without
any radiation, associated with shortness of breath. She had
difficulty doing 1 flight of stairs having to slow down her
pace. Her symptoms did not change with position or activity, but
the pain is worse with deep breath. She had chills, did not take
her temperature and also reports non-productive cough. Since she
started HD she has been having bitemporal headache, which is
unchanged and improves with eccedrin. She has not had urine
output for >2 years. She has a glass of [**Location (un) 2452**] juice at least
daily, reports no change in her medications, no muscle
relaxants, changes in diet, having salt-replacement, diuretics,
steroids. She also denies muscle spasm, muscle cramps, etc.
Occasional dry mouth.

Of note, she was admitted on [**2181-3-22**] for abdominal pain and was
diagnosed with peritonitis with WBC [**Numeric Identifier 77069**] and 94% PMNs in her
peritoneal fluid. There were no bacteria seen in gram stain (at
[**Hospital1 18**]) and cultures are negative so far. She was treated with
Vanc/Ceftaz to complete a 2 week course. Her PD catheter was
pulled. The peritoneal cultures from [**Hospital6 2561**] came
back positve for paecilomyces lilanacus in [**12-9**] bottles from the
peritoneal fluid. She was seen by ID who thought it was a
contaminant and subsequent blood cultures have been negative.
The plan was to put PD catheter this week and go back to PD.

In the emergency room her initial VS were T 100.4? (recorded
10.4) F, HR 109 [**Doctor First Name **], BP 185/131 mmHg, RR 20 X', SpO2 100% in RA.
She was in NAD, chest CTAB, no murmurs, abdomen soft,
non-tender, guaiac negative. Her labs were significant for WBC
of 10.5 (85% PMNs, 8% L, no bands), HCT 26.9 at her baseline
(was 21 recently), PLT of 391, K 8.6, Na 142, Cl 100, CO2 26,
Glu 89, lactate 1.5. ECG showed peaked TW with QRS of 70 ms per
report (normal ECG upon review) and no S1Q3T3 or any signs of RV
strain. Patient was administered calcium gluconate 4g, Dextrose
50% 50mL with 10 U of R Insulin, Sodium Bicarbonate 50mEq,
Sodium Polystyrene Sulfonate, 8 mg of IV morphine and 10 mg of
IV compazine. Her repeat labs showed K of 6.7 with creatinine of
8.9 and BUN of 50, INR 1.2, PTT 27.7. Repeat ECG showed
worsening compared to prior (real peak TW), despite therapy. CXR
showed marked interstitial markings with  bibaslilary alveolar
infiltrates. ER attendings thoguht that her clincal picture was
much more compatible with PE compared to healthcare acquired
pneumonia, so he tested her HCG was HCG:<5 and then she
underwent CT chest with contrast, which showed bilateral
ground-glass opacities without evidence of PE. Pt received
Levofloxacin in ER. She was very difficult access and they could
only place a 20G (required femoral stick for labs). Her VS prior
to transfer were HR 122 BPM, BP 167/114 mmHg, RR 25 X', SpO2 95%
RA.

Past Medical History:
1) MPGN: Diagnosed age 9 by biopsy. S/p LRRT in 08/[**2175**]. Post
transplant pt was doing well, but had rising Cr for two year. In
[**6-/2178**] pt presented with uncontrolled BP requiring ICU
admission for Isradipine drip. Repeat biopsy showed a type 1
MPGN. Negative HepC,HepB,[**Doctor First Name **], and renal U/S from NMEC showed
stable AVF. Her creatinine peaked to 4's and she was started on
steroids, prograf and cellcept. In [**1-/2179**], she required 3
sessions of HD through a right upper chest catheter. Creatinine
slowly recovered to 3.2. Plasmapheresis was then initiated with
plan to then treat with Rituximab. She only underwent 3 sessions
of pheresis. She is now transferred her care to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
at [**Hospital1 18**] to an adult clinic. Her transplant was removed on
[**2179-7-7**]. She was started on PD until [**2181-3-22**] when she developed
peritonitis and she was switched to HD (HD tunnelled line -
M/W/F - [**Location (un) 47**]).
2) Peripheral edema and abdominal striae [**1-9**] steroids
3) HTN [**1-9**] steroids and renal disease, multiple admissions for
Hypertensive emergency.
4) H/o Hemolytic Anemia
5) Migraines

Imaging Studies:

CTA chest ([**2181-4-16**])
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of central, segmental or subsegmental pulmonary
embolism.
2. Multifocal mixed ground-glass opacities indicating pulmonary
edema, but
some small nodular opacities raise the possibility of
superimposed infection in the right clinical setting, atypical
etiologies including PCP are possible.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

CXR PA and LAT ([**2181-4-16**])
The heart size is mildly enlarged. The aorta is tortuous. No
pneumothorax is detected. There are new bilateral perihilar and
bibasilar densities which are concerning for fluid
overload/heart failure. Small right pleural effusion is noted.
The dialysis catheter distal tip projects at the expected
location of the cavoatrial junction. The study and the report
were reviewed by the staff radiologist.
