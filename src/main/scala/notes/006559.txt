IMAGING:
CT ABd/Pelvis:
IMPRESSION:
1. Obstructing 5 x 4 x 10 mm stone within the mid to upper right
ureter, with associated hydroureter and hydronephrosis.
2. Unchanged appearance of numerous cystic lesions within
bilaterally
atrophic kidneys.
3. Unchanged appearance of 2.4 x 2.6 cm right adrenal nodule,
most likely an adenoma given stability, despite intermediate
attenuation on current study.
4. Unchanged anterolisthesis of L4 on L5.


Brief Hospital Course:
80 yo F with hypercarbic respiratory failure [**12-19**] fluid overload,
COPD, OSA, acute on chronic dCHF, admitted with respiratory
failure and acute renal failure secondary to an obstructive
renal calculus.  Her hospital course is as follows:
.
# Hypercarbic Respiratory Acidosis: Her admission ABG was
7.22/88/51 on 6L nasal cannula which improved to 7.25/83/54
after 30 minutes of BiPAP.  Her symptoms were likely related to
her end stage COPD as well as her CHF, OSA, and pulmonary
hypertension with cor pulmonale.  Attempted diuresis was
unsuccessful due to her BP and renal failure.  She was initially
on vanco/zosyn which was changed to cipro for her UTI.  There
was no obvious pulmonary infection.  She stabilized with
intermittent BiPAP and 2-6 liters NC.  Her mentation fluctuated
as did her oxygenation, ranging low 80s to low 90s.  We
continued her bronchodilators.  For the rest of her admission
she remained cyanotic.  Upon admission she was lucid and
competent to make the decision to be DNR/DNI.  Therefore, we did
not intubate her.  She finally expired from her hypercarbic and
hypoxic respiratory failure, leading to cardiac arrest, on [**2-27**]
at 12:10 PM.
.
# Acute on chronic diastolic CHF: She appeared fluid overload on
admission with signs of increased pulmonary congestion.
Diuresis was attempted with a lasix gtt with no effect.  We
continued her ASA, beta blocker, and statin.  However, she may
have been intravscular volume dry, though she did not respond to
gentle IVF boluses.  Her repsiratory status eventually
deteriorated die to her co-morbidities.  There were no signs of
cardiac ischemia during her admission.
.
# Hypotension: The patient was 94 systolic on admission, which
increase to 120's after 500ml bolus in ED.  Her BP stabilized
thereafter.  We held her anti-hypertensives in house.
.
# Obstructing Renal Calculus: The patient was found to be in
ARF.  CT scan demonstrated an obstructing renal calculus.  Urine
studies were also consistent with a UTI.  Urology and IR were
consulted.  A n
