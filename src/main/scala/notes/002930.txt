Chief Complaint:
OSH xfer for L-MCA syndrome

PEG tube.

History of Present Illness:
86y RHF with HTN, HL, afib on amio/BB/warfarin(INR=2.4@OSH) was
air-lifted from [**Hospital3 7569**] this morning out of concern for
acute stroke. She was last known well around 7-8am this morning.
She awoke at ~7am in her USOH. Shortly thereafter, she recalls
going to the bathroom. After finishing in the bathroom, she had
difficulty getting up from the toilet (but does not specifically
remember R-sided weakness), and fell between the toilet and the
wall. Her husband found her around an hour later, and first
called her grandson to help move her. They then called 911 to
activate EMS. By report, the OSH assessment was NIHSS=19, but no
details. Her VS and labs were unremarkable, except for 1. her
INR
therapeutic in the mid-2s, 2. elevated T.bili 1.7 and AST/ALT
each in the 50s, unexplained. A NCHCT was performed, which was
negative for e/o hemorrhage, but + for dense Left-MCA sign
(elongated dense mid-to-distal-M1). The warfarin A/C is an
absolute contraindication to IV t-[**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] the patient was
transferred here after conferring with our Stroke Fellow, Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 7741**].

She arrived in NAD with VSS and prominent right-sided weakness,
as reported. My NIHSS on arrival was 14 (see below for NIHSS and
detailed Neurologic exam). I got the above collateral history
from the patient, who was a slightly difficult historian
primarily due to dysarthria, and her daughter, who arrived
shortly after the patient. We got a NCHCT here, which confirmed
absence of hemorrhage; CTA head/neck revealed near-total
obstuction of the distal M1 on the Left, as well as collateral
filling of several distal MCA-distribution vessels; CTP showed
increased MTT throughout the Left MCA distribution, with a
mismatched CBV result (mildly decreased volume in the Left MCA
distribution, in contrast to the dramatically increased MTT; CBF
was moderately decreased). We activated [**Doctor First Name 10788**] (attg/fellow @[**Hospital1 112**])
and anesthesiology, ~5-5.5h out from the onset at that point,
and
had the patient intubated in the ED and sent to [**Doctor First Name 10788**] for
attempted
interventional clot removal.

By the time of intubation, the patient had recovered a modicum
of
RUE movement (she could flex the elbow and wrist weakly, on
command), but exam was otherwise the same as before. The [**Doctor First Name 10788**]
team
was unsuccessful in retrieving the clot. Their angiography
appears to confirm the M1 occlusion as well as collateral late
filling distal MCA-vessels from what appears to me to be a
branch
of the ? middle meningeal artery. A stat NCHCT after the
procedure revealed swelling and hyperintensity in the
caudate/putamen and GP on the side of the infarct, with mass
effect into the R-LV; difficult to tell at this stage how much
is
contrast dye from the [**Doctor First Name 10788**] procedure vs. how much is hemorrhagic
conversion related to the procedure in the setting of INR 1.9.
She was admitted to the "NICU" (formerly SICU-B) and signed out
to the on-call Neurology [**Male First Name (un) **] and the on-call SICU/NICU
resident. This plan was discussed in detail all along the course
of the aforementioned events with the ED team, the patient's
family, the stroke fellow, and the stroke attending (Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **].

CT head [**2159-2-2**]:
HISTORY: Left MCA stroke with hemorrhagic transformation.

Comparison is made with [**2159-1-30**]. Hemorrhage in the left
caudate head and
putamen with surrounding edema is relatively stable. The degree
of effacement  of the left lateral ventricle frontal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] is
unchanged. There is minimal if  any midline shift. No
progression of hemorrhage is seen.
There is opacification of the sphenoid sinuses unchanged.

CXR : [**2159-2-3**]:

Severe cardiomegaly and mild pulmonary edema have improved since
[**2-1**], subsequently unchanged. Pleural effusions are small
if any. Transvenous right atrial and right ventricular pacer
leads are unchanged in standard placements. Right PIC line
passes as far as the upper SVC, but the tip is indistinct. No
pneumothorax.


Brief Hospital Course:
86y F with a Left-MCA distal occlusion could be embolic, given
her known a-fib, although the therapeutic INR mitigates this
probability a bit.  she was admitted to the NeuroICU for further
treatment.   She arrived in NAD with VSS and prominent
right-sided weakness, as reported. NeuroIR team was unsuccessful
in retrieving the clot. Their angiography appears to confirm the
M1 occlusion as well as collateral late filling distal
MCA-vessels from what appears to me to be a branch
off the middle meningeal artery. A stat NCHCT after the
procedure revealed swelling and hyperintensity in the
caudate/putamen and GP on the side of the infarct, with mass
effect into the R-LV   contrast dye from the [**Doctor First Name 10788**] procedure vs.
how much is hemorrhagic. She was transferred to the medical
wards for further care. On the medical wards she had a stable
course. She had a PEG tube placed. On examination she did very
little and this did not improve throughout her course. the
family was made aware that she has a possible poor outcome.

Neurologic:
- She was started ASA ([**1-29**]), and maintain BP goals between 120
and 160.  She appeared to initially be sensitive to a drop in
SBP less than 140.  PT/OT were consulted.  For risk factor
reduction her LDL was 34.  A TTE: EF 55-60%, Mild symmetric LVH,
[**12-17**]+ MR, 3+ TR. Mild PA HTN. No SD. For her afib, initially held
her anticoagulants. Her rate was controlled via her pacer. She
was restarted on her coumadin with an Aspirin bridge. Goal INR
[**1-18**].

Pulmonary:
- On room air. Mouth breather.

Gastrointestinal / Abdomen:
- Famotidine for prophylaxis.  A PEG was then placed on [**2159-2-7**].


Nutrition:
- NPO, on Tube feeds. You will be placed on Jevity 1.2 at goal
rate of 50cc/hr
