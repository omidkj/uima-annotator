Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 13662**] was brought to the Operating room and underwent a
left sided craniotomy after her INR was reversed to 1.3.
Post-operatively she brought to the surgical ICU where her BP
was kept less than 140, INR less than 1.3.  She had a subdural
drain in place.

On [**9-30**] an MRI was done that showed an acute infarction
involving the left MCA (posterior branch and portions of the
anterior branches), left PCA, and left basal ganglia. These
findings suggest compromise, likely embolic, of the M1 branch.
Stable left temporal hemorrhagic contusion.  Acute hemorrhagic
extension of the previously known subacute right PCA infarction.
Stable appearance of bilateral subdural hematomas.

Neurologically her exam was poor, she would withdraw lower
extremeties to painful stimuli, toes were upgoing.  On [**10-2**] she
was noted to be deceberate posturing in upper extremeties which
progessed to posturing of all extremeties, pupils were larger
4.5 and 4.0.  Her JP drain was discontinued on [**10-4**].

On [**10-3**] Ms [**Known lastname 13662**] developed a fever a full fever work up
including a bilateral lower extremetity ultrasound which showed
bilateral DVT's for which she had a IVC filter placed on [**10-5**].
She was also treated for a left lower pneumonia and had a 10 day
treatment of Levo and Cefapime and Fluconazole for yeast in
urine.

Immediate discussions were started with [**Hospital **] [**Known lastname 13662**] health care
proxy, Dr [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 1494**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 42891**] and [**Name (NI) **] [**Last Name (un) **] about the severity
of Ms [**Known lastname 13662**] brain injury and that she would most likely remain
in a persistent vegitative state and not regain consciousness
needing 24 hour nursing care.  Given this information Ms
[**Name13 (STitle) 42891**] wanted to proceed caring for Ms [**Known lastname 13662**] requesting a PEG
and trach.
A head CT on [**10-11**] showed evolution of left middle cerebral
artery infarct. No evidence of new hemorrhage. Residual
bilateral subacute/chronic subdural hematomas. Chronic right
posterior cerebral artery infarct.

Ethics committee was involved however Ms [**Name13 (STitle) 42891**] would not meet
with our team and ethics team, she continued to want full care
to continue.

During the last 2 weeks of her hospital course she would open
her eyes to noxious stimuli and deceberate posture to
suctioning.  She was treated for Staph aureus coag + blood
cultures and needs 14 days total of Vancomycin ends [**10-31**].
 She was also treated for C-Diff for 14 days with Flagyl ends
[**11-2**].

Her tube feeds are at goal of Promote with fiber at 60 hr and
vent settings of CPAP 10 pressure support and 5 of Peep and FiO2
of 40%
