Admission Date:  [**2184-2-16**]     Discharge Date:  [**2184-2-20**]

Date of Birth:   [**2164-8-25**]     Sex:  M


CHIEF COMPLAINT:  The patient was admitted with a chief
complaint of idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 19-year-old male with
persistent cough beginning in [**2183-8-23**].  At that
time he also noted significant weight gain with an increase
in his pants size by two sizes from [**Month (only) **] to [**Month (only) 359**].
From [**Month (only) 359**] to [**Month (only) **] his cough continued, and his pants
size increased another two sizes.  In [**Month (only) **], the patient
noted difficulty lying flat.  He also noted that his cough
became more productive, and in [**Month (only) 1096**] noted the onset
differentiate between vomit or sputum production.  Since
[**2183-10-23**], he also noted increasing fatigue and
decreased exercise tolerance leading him to quit work and
quit school.  He went and saw someone for this cough in
[**2183-12-23**], and he was prescribed bronchodilator therapy
for presumed asthma.  This did not help him.  He returned to
[**Hospital 11074**] clinic three weeks later and was prescribed
antibiotics.  He continued these antibiotics for 10 days
without improvement.

In [**2184-1-23**], he went to an outside hospital in [**State 1727**]
close to where he lived.  They did a chest x-ray there which
showed an enlarged heart.  For this reason, and for his
continuing congestive heart failure symptoms, including
inability to lay flat, dyspnea on exertion, and edema, he was
admitted to the outside hospital from [**2-4**] to
[**2184-2-9**].  He was diuresed 16 liters, and he was
placed on a cardiac regimen.  A number of laboratory tests
were sent to try to determine the etiology of his dilated
cardiomyopathy; all of which were negative, although some
were still pending.  He was discharged on [**2184-2-9**]
and went to see an outpatient cardiologist who desired a
cardiac catheterization and referred him to [**Hospital1 346**] for a cardiac catheterization,
Swan-Ganz catheter placement, and further diuresis.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Bipolar disorder.
2.  Anxiety disorder.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Lisinopril 10 mg p.o. q.d.,
digoxin 0.375 mg p.o. q.d., Coreg 3.125 mg p.o. b.i.d.,
Lasix 40 mg p.o. q.d., BuSpar 10 mg p.o. t.i.d.,
Serzone 150 mg p.o. b.i.d., [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 233**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1002**] replacement.

FAMILY HISTORY:   He has no significant family history.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  He denies any alcohol, drug or tobacco use.
He denies any recent travel.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  On physical
examination vital signs revealed afebrile, heart rate of 98,
blood pressure of 118/74, respiratory rate of 22 to 24,
oxygen saturation of 97% to 98% on room air.  In general, he
was a young obese man in no acute distress.  Head, eyes,
ears, nose, and throat examination revealed normocephalic and
atraumatic.  Pupils were equal, round, and reactive to light.
Extraocular movements were intact.  He was anicteric.  His
oropharynx was clear with no lesions or masses.  His neck was
supple.  It was difficult to assess jugular venous distention
secondary to body habitus.  He had decreased carotid pulses.
Chest examination revealed he was clear to auscultation
bilaterally.  On heart examination, he was tachycardic.  He
had a regular rate.  First heart sound and second heart sound
were normal, and third heart sound was heard at the apex.
Abdominal examination was soft, nontender, and nondistended,
normal bowel sounds.  Extremities revealed trace to 1+ edema
bilaterally of the lower extremities.  Distal pulses were
palpable and 1+ in amplitude.  On neurologic examination, he
was alert and oriented times three; a nonfocal neurologic
examination.

PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:  Laboratory data
revealed a white blood cell count of 8.5, hematocrit of 41.8,
platelets of 275.  PT of 13.5, PTT of 23.6.  SMA-7 revealed a
sodium of 141, potassium of 3.9, chloride of 105, bicarbonate
of 25, blood urea nitrogen of 15, creatinine of 1.1, and
glucose of 106.  Calcium was 9, magnesium of 1.9.  Creatine
kinase of 36.  Digoxin level was 1.2.  Uric acid level
was 10.  The laboratories from the outside hospital to work
up the etiology of the cardiomyopathy included a
thyroid-stimulating hormone of 1.8, a free T4 of 1.46, and a
negative [**Last Name (LF) 9877**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] antinuclear antibody of 1:40, C
reactive protein of 18.2, normal iron studies, and hemoglobin
A1c of 4.9.  B12 and folate studies were normal.  A Lyme
titer was negative.  Serum selenium [**Location (un) **] B, human
immunodeficiency virus, and toxo antibody laboratory tests
were all pending at the time of this Discharge Summary.

RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:   The cardiac catheterization showed no
coronary artery disease.  Right atrial pressure was 20, right
ventricular was 57/22, wedge pressure of 36, left ventricular
end-diastolic pressure was 32.  The catheterization revealed
severe pulmonary hypertension, cardiac output of 6, cardiac
index of 2.4.  It showed a global left ventricular systolic
dysfunction with an ejection fraction of approximately 10% to
15% with no focal wall motion abnormalities.  The mitral
valve and aortic valves were normal.  There was an elevated
left ventricular end-diastolic volume of 111.

Electrocardiogram was read as sinus tachycardia at
approximately 104, normal axis, prolonged P-R intervals,
greater than 200 msec.  There were no Q waves, no left
ventricular hypertrophy.  T waves were inverted in the
precordial leads.  There was good R wave progression.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  This is a 19-year-old male with
idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy leading to severe
congestive heart failure.  The etiology is unknown at this
point in time.  Most likely diagnoses include viral (possibly
[**Doctor Last Name 3271**]-[**Doctor Last Name **] virus, human immunodeficiency virus, or another
virus), sleep apnea, or tachycardia induced.  The patient
denies any exposure or over-the-counter medication usage.  An
a.m. cortisol level will be checked to rule out [**Location (un) **]
disease.  The other laboratories from the outside hospital
will be followed up on.  Plan as follows:

1.  CARDIOVASCULAR:  (a) Pump function:  The patient's ACE
inhibitor will be increased as much as he can tolerate it.  A
diuresis with Lasix will be achieved with a goal of 2 liters
negative per day.  Aldactone 25 mg will be added to the
patient's regimen.  The outside hospital laboratories will be
followed up.  A congestive heart failure consultation will be
obtained in order to connect the patient with heart
transplant services.

2.  OTHER SYSTEMS:  The patient's creatinine and electrolytes
will be followed given diuresis.  The patient's hematocrit
will be followed.  These will be corrected as needed.

HOSPITAL COURSE:   On hospital day two, the patient was
diuresed 2 liters overnight with minimal improvement in his
cardiac output or cardiac index.  The Swan-Ganz catheter was
discontinued.  An a.m. cortisol level returned as normal

On hospital day three, the patient was diuresed another 2
liters and was transferred to the floor.  On hospital day
four, the patient's ACE inhibitor was increased to
lisinopril 40 mg.  The patient was put on 40 mg p.o. q.d. of
Lasix for diuresis with good effect.

On hospital day five, on [**2-19**], the patient was placed
a regimen intended as his discharge output regimen.  This
included digoxin 0.375 mg p.o. q.d., carvedilol 6.25 mg p.o.
q.d., Lasix 40 mg p.o. q.d., lisinopril 40 mg p.o. q.d.,
Aldactone 25 mg p.o. q.d.

The patient spoke with the Congestive Heart Failure Service
regarding heart transplantation, and his outpatient
cardiologist has already made an appointment for him at
[**Hospital6 1129**] to see a heart transplant
specialist.  The patient will seek this route.

DISCHARGE DISPOSITION:  On [**2184-2-20**], the patient will
most likely be discharged on the previously dictated
medications.

DISCHARGE FOLLOWUP:  (His follow-up appointments include)
1.  The heart transplantation specialist at [**Hospital6 2121**].
2.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1
