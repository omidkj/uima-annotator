Brief Hospital Course:
[**Age over 90 **]yo man with recent hospitalizations for C diff, NSTEMI, and
pneumonia presented with hypotension and ARF thought secondary
to persistent c diff colitis with resulting dehydration and
aflutter with rapid ventricular rate.
.
In the ICU, he was started on levophed (which was changed to
neosynephrine and titrated off [**6-24**] at approximately 4pm). He
was started on ceftazidime for possible PNA, vancomycin IV, and
flagyl. He was noted to be in SVT and converted to sinus rhythm
after amiodarone loading. Stool cx was positive for c diff, and
he was changed to flagyl/vanco po, other antibiotics were
discontinued. He was noted to have a Hct of 24 on admission and
received 1 unit PRBC with minimal change in hematocrit, but was
guaiac negative. He was transferred to the general medical floor
on [**2188-6-25**].
.
Summary of hospital course:
1) Atrial flutter: While in the MICU, the patient had
hypotension in the setting of atrial flutter in the 150s, after
which he converted to normal sinus rhythm following amiodarone
drip. Following transfer to the floor, he had several episodes
of atrial flutter in the 140s, converting following IV
metoprolol/dilitazem. The electrophysiology service was
consulted, who recommended titrating up beta blocker as
tolerated by blood pressure. His metoprolol was titrated up
gradually to 50 mg PO BID, amiodarone was continued, and, at
time of discharge, the patient had been in paced rhythm (60s)
without atrial flutter for >72 hours. He will follow-up in pacer
clinic as scheduled. Thyroid function tests revealed an elevated
TSH at 6.3, however but free T4 was within normal limits at 1.2;
recheck as an outpatient in 6 wks.

2. C. diff colitis: The patient was initially on
metronidazole/vancomycin, with improvement in diarrhea.
Metronidazole was discontinued on [**6-29**], and the patient will
continue on PO vancomycin 250 mg PO q6hrs to complete a 3 week
course, after which the dose will be gradually tapered and
pulsed (see discharge medications). Rifaxamin was added to his
regimen on [**7-2**]. In the future, if he should be started on
antibiotics for an other infection, vancomycin 125 mg PO q6h
should be given at the same time. The patient's abdominal exam
was closely monitored throughout his hospital course, and he had
several KUBs (last [**6-26**]) without evidence of megacolon. At time
of discharge, he is having ~ 5 BM/day. His stool output should
be monitored to ensure gradual clearance of infection. The
gastroenterology service followed him throughout his hospital
course

3. Hypotension: The hypotension noted on admission was likely
multifactorial due to C. diff-associated sepsis and cardiogenic
shock from atrial flutter. Cortisol stimulation test in the ICU
was within normal limits, indicating the patient was not
adrenally insufficient. At time of discharge, the patients blood
pressure is stable (sbp 110s-130s).

4. Anemia: At time of discharge, the patients hematocrit is
stable at 30.5 (baseline low-mid 30s). He has a history of GI
bleed, but, while he had several trace guaiac positive stools
during his admission, there was no evidence of significance GI
bleeding. He received 2 units of PRBC during his hospital stay
([**6-24**] and [**6-29**]). Iron studies were consistent with anemia of
chronic disease.

5. Acute renal failure: The patient's creatinine was 2.1 on
admission, improving to ~ 1 on discharge. His renal failure was
likely due to hypovolemia with pre-renal azotemia, with possible
contributor of ATN in the setting of diarrhea and hypotension.


6. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelets dropped to 119 on
[**2188-6-25**], likely due to a combination of dilutional effect (in
the setting of fluid resuscitation) and sepsis. HIT Ab was
negative. At discharge, the patient's platelets are stable at
275.

7. Code status: DNR/DNI. The palliative care followed the
patient during his hospital stay.
