Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was initially admitted to the trauma ICU.
Neurosurgery was consulted from the ED and recommended
conservative management.  Orthopedia surgery was also consulted
and recommended a sling for comfort.  She was started on cipro
for UTI. She did well in the unit and was transferred to the
floor on HD 1.  She triggered for a desaturation event on
[**2124-11-22**] and was transferred back to the unit.  She was
intubated and bronched twice.  Her right lung was nearly [**Last Name (un) 57454**]
out and an aspiration was suspected.  She was extubated on
[**2124-11-23**] and expressed her wish not to be reintubated.  In
conjunction with her family she was made DNR/DNI.  Her
respiratory status continued to decline and on [**2124-11-26**] the
decision was made to change her code status to CMO.  She expired
a few hours later.

CT Cspine ([**2124-11-20**]) - No fracture or malalignment.

CT Chest ([**2124-11-20**]) - Right upper lobe pulmonary opacity,
compatible with contusion injury and/or aspiration(given few air
bronchograms). Underlying infection not
excluded, although felt less likely given history. Adjacent
pleural
thickening. There are adjacent rib fractures as described, both
acute and
chronic. Bibasilar consolidations with secretions in the right
lower lobe bronchus
concerning for aspiration pneumonia. Small bilateral pleural
effusions.  Right clavicular fracture, minimally displaced.
Atherosclerotic disease.  Breast calcifications.

Echo ([**2124-11-21**]) - Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy
with normal biventricular systolic function. Mild mitral
regurgitation. Mild aortic stenosis.
