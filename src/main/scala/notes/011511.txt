   RADIOLOGY  Final Report

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2200-7-8**] 8:51 AM

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)

Reason: effusion

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
63 year old man with s/p aortic stent
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
effusion
AP PORTABLE CHEST, [**2200-7-8**] AT 0849 HOURS.

HISTORY: Status post aortic stent.

COMPARISON: Multiple priors, the most recent dated [**2200-7-4**].

FINDINGS: The study is mildly compromised secondary to
positioning. The left internal jugular approach vascular sheath
has been removed. Left-sided pleural drains have also been
removed in the interval. A right internal jugular approach
central venous catheter remains stable in course and position
with the distal tip just distal to the cavoatrial junction.
There has developed left lower lobe collapse. There are
bilateral pleural effusions more notable on the right with
significant posteriorly layering component. The perihilar haze
previously noted has mildly improved with no significant
superimposed edema at this time. There is a rounded nodular
opacity now projecting within the left lower lobe. No
pneumothorax is evident. Again noted are changes consistent with
prior median sternotomy. The exaggerated descending thoracic
aortic contour is stable and consistent with known preexisting
aortic pathology.

IMPRESSION: Relative clearing of edema with persisting bilateral
pleural effusions, right worse than left. There has been
interval development of left lower lobe collapse with a rounded
opacity near the left lung base, which likely represents
loculated fluid within fissure, "pseudotumor."

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify
I was present in compliance with HCFA regulations. No TEE

throughout the
procedure. The patient appears to be in sinus rhythm. Results

Conclusions:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. The left atrium is
elongated. Mild
spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body of the right
atrium. No atrial
septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular
wall thickness,
cavity size, and systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%). Right
ventricular
systolic function is borderline normal. A dissection flap is
seen in the lower
portion of the thoracic descending aorta. There is flow in the
false lumen.
The patient is s/p graft replacement of the ascending aorta.
Stent material is
seen in the proximal descending thoracic aorta. The aortic valve
leaflets (3)
are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Mild to
moderate
([**2-11**]+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets
are mildly
thickened. Trivial mitral regur
