Penicillins

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2387**]
Chief Complaint:
Ventricular fibrillation and cardiac arrest.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Endotracheal intubation at outside hospital.

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname **] is a 54 year-old gentleman with prior history
of mitral prolapse with myxomatous changes, dyslipidemia who
underwent a possible seizure and then a cardiac arrest with a
tachycardia who now is transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] for further care. Pt
was in his prior state of health and had a normal echocardiogram
and stress test 2 weeks ago (per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and Family) until
[**2159-6-23**] when he was about to interview for a new job. Patient
he was not having any abnormal movements and he did not loose
sphincter control. He did not have a pulse and was not
responsive. Vomit was found in his mouth. CPR was initiated.
When EMS arrived his HR was ~220s in AFib (per report) and
patient was shocked x2 without response. Pt received epinephrine
and atropine. Then he received lidocaine. Then he went into VFib
and was successfully shocked out of it. He was transferred to
the ER of [**Hospital 6136**] Hospital Group, his SpO2 was always >95%
per report. In the ER, his ECG showed sinus tachycardia with
RBBB, ST depression in lateral leads (V2-V6), QS in D3, AVF, D2.
His cardiac enzymes were negative, glucose was 330. Temp 39.4 C.
WBC 7.1, HGB 13.1, HCT 39.5, Trop 0.02. Na 141, K 2.8, Cl 107,
HCO3 12, Gap 22, Glucose 381, BUN 18, creatinine 1.2, calcium
8.1, albumin 3.6, alk phos 53, AST 248, ALT 259, CK 80, PT 12.6,
INR 1. CT scan did not show clearly C3-C4, so patient was kept
in collar. His tox-screen was positive for opioids and
canabinoids. Cool-down protocol was initiated and patient was
admitted to the ICU and kept on it for 24 hours.

He was minimally reponsive afterwards. Pt had serial ECGs that
showed multiple PVCs, changes in axis and AFib. His Trop I
peaked at 2.24 and CK at 5572 with MB of 36.2 and MBI 0.6%.
Patient underwent echocardiogram that shwoed EF 55%, LV mildly
dilated, no wall-motion abnormality, no intra-cardiac thrombus,
LA normal, bicuspid aortic valve, MR [**First Name (Titles) 151**] [**Last Name (Titles) 82966**] changes.

His LFTs were elevated to 300 range and 1:1 ratio, bilirubin of
2.0, albumin of 3.3 normal INR, that were thought to be
secondarely to shock liver. Pt had one episode of hematuria with
aspirin and lovenox, that was thought to be traumatic.

Pt was febrile up to [**Age over 90 **] yesterday and with WBC of 14,000.
Therefore, there was concerned for VAP and he was started on
Zosyn.

CXR ([**2159-6-25**]): The heart size appears to be enlarged, which
might be exaggerated by the low lung volumes. There is left
retrocardiac opacity containing air bronchogram that might
represent infection, aspiration or combination of both as well
as atelectasis. The left hilus appears to be enlarged, which
might be due to low lung volumes and summation of shadows,
although left hilar abnormality cannot be excluded. The right
lung is grossly unremarkable. There is most likely present small
amount of pleural effusion. There is no pneumothorax, at least
within the limitations of this radiograph. Followup with chest
radiograph with better lung volumes is recommended or preferably
PA and lateral whenever patient conditions allow.

CXR ([**2159-7-2**]): Improved lung aeration without new acute
cardiopulmonary process.

Cardiac Cath ([**2159-6-26**]): 1. Coronary angiography in this right
dominantsystem demonstrated no flow obstructing lesions on
angiography. The LMCa had minimal luminal irregularities. The
LAD had mild luminal irregularities on angiography. The Cx had
no angiographically apparent disease. The RCA had a spasm in the
mid vessel that resolved during the catheterization and had no
angiographically apparent disease afterwards.
2. Resting hemodynamics revealed right sided filling pressures.
RVEDP
was 20mmHg. PCWP was slightly elevated at 17mmHg. There was mild

pulmonary artery hypertension with a systolic pressure of 49
mmHg.
3. Oxygen saturation revealed a step off between the SVC and all

[**Doctor Last Name 1754**] of the heart. However Qp/Qs ratio was 0.90 so no
intracardiac
shunt was calculated. FINAL DIAGNOSIS: 1. Coronary arteries are
normal. 2. Mild pulmary hypetension with PASP of 49mmHg 3.
Arterial shunt with step off from aorta to RA

ECHO ([**2159-6-26**]): The left atrium is normal in size. The
interatrial septum is aneurysmal. No atrial septal defect or
patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline
contrast with maneuvers. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are
normal. The left ventricular cavity is moderately dilated.
Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic root is moderately dilated at the sinus level. The
ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic
