Chief Complaint:
DKA

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Mr [**Known lastname 17839**] received a colonoscopy on [**2135-5-27**] for
evaluation of diarrhea.  The colonoscopy showed normal bowel,
though several biopsies were taken.  He also received an EGD on
[**2135-5-31**] that revealed extensive inflammation of the esophagus,
liklely resulting from refluxed stomach acids into the
esophagus.


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 17839**] is a 49 year old gentleman with DMI, CAD, PVD and
ESRD s/p living related donor transplant [**2122**] who initially
presented to the ED on [**5-22**] with a two-week history of diarrhea,
nausea, vomiting and fevers.

The pt states that he was in his USOH until approximately two
weeks ago when he developed diarrhea, which he describes as
loose and watery, non-bloody and without mucous, approximately
[**12-30**] BM/day. He has also been having low-grade temps to 100.2
over the past 1-2 weeks with chills. He was started on an
empiric trial of ciprofloxacin by his PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**2135-5-18**]. He
subsequently developed nausea and bilious emesis over the past
2-3 days with myalgias and increasing fatigue and decreasing po
intake.

The patient reports a chronic cough for the past 6 months, which
is unchanged. Denies HA, neck stiffness, SOB, chest pain, PND,
abdominal pain. He does report decreasing UOP for the past [**3-1**]
days. He had a dental procedure three weeks ago.

In ED, the patient was afebrile with lactate of 1.3. BP was
initially 103/57 with HR 82 and glucose of 443 with anion gap of
25. He was given Vanc/Zosyn and started on an insulin gtt. His
BP subsequently decreased to 85/44 with HR 87 and he was given
hydrocortisone 100mg IV x 1. Anion gap increased to 27 prior to
transfer to MICU.

In the MICU the patient was managed with fluids and insulin gtt.
The cause of his DKA was thought to be either a urinary tract
infection or a community acquired pneumonia. He was also noted
to have elevated cardiac enzymes and his NSTEMI was thought to
be either a precipitant of his DKA or a cuase of his DKA. He
continued to have a mixed acid/base disturbance due to
persistant diarrhea. He was continued on aspirin and beta
blocker for his NSTEMI. He also was noted to have acute renal
failure. His [**Last Name (un) **] was held. He was seen by the renal service who
felt he had prerenal failure with a urine sodium of 10. Today
his insulin gtt was stopped at 7 pm and he received his regular
glargine dose.

CATH [**2135-1-21**]:
 COMMENTS:     1.  Selective coronary angiography of this right
dominant
 system revealed multi vessel coronary disease.  The LMCA was
without
 flow limiting stenoses.  The LAD contained a 90% proximal
lesion before
 becoming totally occluded just after a large septal.  The LCX
contained
 diffuse disease, up to a 95% mid vessel.  OM1 was totally
occluded.  A
 Ramus branch had a 70% proximal lesion.  The RCA was totally
occluded
 proximally.
 2.  Graft aniography revealed a patent LIMA-LAD, SVG-PDA, and
SVG-RI.
 The SVG to OM was totally occluded (could not be engaged and no
seen on  aortogram).  Of note, the SVG-PDA graft was engaged
with [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 17931**]
 catheter.
 3.  Limited resting hemodynamics revealed a central aortic
pressure of
 158/72 (elevated) and an elevated LVEDP of 26mmHg.
 4.  Of note, access was obtained from the left groin as the
patient's
 renal xplant is located on the right.
 FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
 1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
 2. Patent LIMA-LAD, SVG-PDA, SVG-RI.
 3. Occluded SVG-OM.

Brief Hospital Course:
49M with DMI, CAD, PVD and ESRD s/p living related donor
transplant [**2122**] presents with two-week history of diarrhea,
nausea, vomiting and fevers found to have UTI, DKA and acute on
chronic renal failure.

1. DKA: Pt had elevated glucose of 443 with anion gap of 25 with
pH of 7.31 and only trace ketones, suggestive of DKA. UTI is
likely precipitating factor, though has been on ciprofloxacin as
an outpatient for five days.  Can also consider prostatitis.
The patient was aggressively hydrated in the intensive care unit
and transitioned from insulin gtt to glargine with sliding
scale. Anion gap on transfer to medicine floor was 13.  Pt was
eventually restated on glargine nightly with insulin sliding
scale for breakthrough coverage.

2. Hemodynamics: Pt was initially normotensive in the ED, but
became hypotensive. Did not meet SIRS criteria. Hypotension
likely a result of hypovolemia related to diarrhea, emeisis,
decreased po intake and infection. In the MICU, pt was assessed
for adrenal insufficiency which was negative. Once on the floor,
pt was maintained on IVF and throughout his course, BP continued
to rise. Patient was gradually resumed on home antihypertensive
regimen, first metoprolol to 100mg daily, then with the addition
of norvasc, and finally, once creatinine returned to baseline,
with valsartan.

3. ID: The patient presented with pyuria and diarrhea, despite
starting
