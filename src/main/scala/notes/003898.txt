Attending:[**Doctor First Name 5188**]
Chief Complaint:
raw skin around ostomy

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Takedown/reversal of ileostomy with ileorectal anastomosis.


History of Present Illness:
This is a 61 yo woman with h/o colostomy/ileostomy, COPD, morbid
obesity who presents with increased output from wound adjacent
to ostomy. Of note she went home from rehab at the end of [**Month (only) 116**]
(about 2 weeks ago) and things seem to be worse since. She notes
the VNA nurse told her about a week ago she had an open area
adjacent to her ostomy that was draining. She has had such
discomfort from the skin around her ostomy that she has been
unable to keep an ostomy bag on it for the last week or so. She
was seen by someone (? PCP) [**6-12**] who started her on keflex to try
to help the abdominal wall irritation improve (with no sign
change-finished [**6-19**]) and also started her on macrobid for a UTI
(but Ms. [**Known lastname **] took it [**Hospital1 **] instead of QID so is still taking
it even though it was to finish [**6-19**] and took 1/2 dose). She
states she couldnt take it at home anymore so came in. Denies
change in stool consistency, fevers or chills. She feels diffuse
abdominal pain. No nausea or emesis but has been eating less
intentionally so she could reduce her stool output for the last
3 days.

CT Abd
CT ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST: Focal consolidation at the left
lung base is
unchanged, and likely represents atelectasis. There is no
pleural effusion. The heart is normal in size without
pericardial effusion.

In the abdomen, the liver, gallbladder, pancreas, spleen,
adrenal glands,
stomach, and duodenum are unremarkable. The kidneys enhance and
excrete
contrast symmetrically. There is no free air or free fluid in
the abdomen.
The abdominal aorta demonstrates mild atherosclerotic
calcification. Scattered mesenteric and retroperitoneal lymph
nodes do not meet CT criteria for pathologic enlargement.

A percutaneous G-tube terminates in the stomach.

CT PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST: The patient is post colectomy.
Multiple loops of small bowel contain oral contrast, and are not
distended. Contrast extends through the small bowel to the
ileostomy site in the anterior abdominal wall, and passes freely
through the ileostomy. Only a single channel of contrast passes
through the abdominal wall. No contrast-filled enterocutaneous
fistula is identified. A small focus of air within the deep
subcutaneous/muscular layers adjacent to the ileostomy site is
noted, decreased since the prior study. There is no associated
fluid collection to suggest abscess. Stranding is noted in the
subcutaneous tissues.

The urinary bladder, distal ureters, uterus, and adnexa are
unremarkable.
There is no free fluid in the pelvis. There is no pelvic or
inguinal
lymphadenopathy by size criteria.

OSSEOUS STRUCTURES: S-shaped curvature of the spine is
unchanged. There is
no fracture or worrisome bony lesion. Soft tissues are
unremarkable.
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of enterocutaneous fistula at this time.
2. Interval decrease in size of subcutaneous air adjacent to the
ostomy. No associated fluid collection to suggest abscess.

Brief Hospital Course:
In short, Ms [**Known lastname **] is a 61 y/o F with hx of colostomy, COPD,
HTN, DM and obesity who presented from home with inability to
care for her ostomy and worsening skin breakdown around the
site.
.
# Ostomy wound and skin breakdown - patient was evaluated in the
ED with a CT scan showing flow through the ostomy without any
entero-cutaneous fistulas. Wound care nurse at home told patient
there was a fistula. Surgery evaluated her in the ED and does
not think there is a fistula as the wound adjacent to the ostomy
was probed and could not be passed.  The ostomy nurse examined
the patient and recommended some various wound cleaning
suggestions, as well as placing a bag over the ostomy.  She
continued to have pain around her wound throughout her admission
and was treated with dilaudid PO which controlled the pain to an
acceptable level.  The wound did not appear infected.
.
# Nausea and vomitting - the two days prior to discharge, the
patient developed some nausea and vomitting.  It is unclear the
etiology.  She felt better with zofran.  She thinks it was
something in the food that she ate.  She had the same level of
abdominal pain that she had upon admission, and was tolerating
POs and having appropriate output through her colostomy.
Surgery was following along and did serial exams that were not
concerning for an acute abdomen.  She can continue to be treated
wtih antiemetics as needed as long as she has appropriate stool
output and vomit remains non bilious and non bloody.
.
# UTI - had positive UA but culture grew yeast and was likely a
contaminant.  Had one day of cipro and then it was stopped when
culture data returned.
.
# DM - patient takes metformin at home, sugars have been well
controlled, was d/c'ed on lantus previously.  We held the
metformin because of her CKD and put her on insulin sliding
scale.  Her HbA1c was 5.7.  She can stay on insulin for now but
eventually go back on metformin (if her kidney function is ok)
as she would be unlikely to be able to administer insul
