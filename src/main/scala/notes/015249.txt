Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
central venous line

History of Present Illness:
85 yo F with h/o DM2, HTN, PVD, AV block s/p PPM and CM w/ ICD
in place who was found with AMS at home. The patient was
initially admitted after being found in her home, where she
lives with her schizosphrenic son. [**Name (NI) **] [**Name2 (NI) 802**] [**Name (NI) 1154**] is her HCP,
and is a [**Name (NI) 42137**] at [**Hospital1 18**]. She reports that the patient has been
declining over past few months, and has refused nursing home.
On admission, patient was found to have UTI (>100K micrococci)
and was started on ampicillin. She was also noted to have left
ankle venous ulcer, which has been seen by podiatry and vascular
surgery. She was given 1 dose of vanco and zosyn but concern for
infection of ulcer was low so these were stopped.
She had an episode of hypotension to SBP 70's despite aggressive
IVF, also with tenous IV access, and was transferred to MICU.
Upon arrival to MICU, IJ was placed and blood pressure improved
without any futher intervention. A foley catheter was placed to
assess urine output, which has been adequate. The patient had
low grade fevers initially, now afebrile. She complains only of
back pain which is chronic, although communication is difficult
due to severe loss of hearing.

Brief Hospital Course:
85F with DM, PVD, CHF and deafness, admitted for altered mental
status, found to have UTI.
.
#. AMS/UTI: The patient was initially agitated and complaining
of back pain, which is apparently chronic for her. She was given
levaquin given her history of legionella pneumonia. Her CXR was
unremarkable. Her head CT did not show any new lesions. UA
normal but urine culture grew micrococcus/stomatococcus
>100,000. This was considered a UTI and patient was treated with
ampicillin for 7 days. Blood cx all neg. Repeat urine culture
was negative. WBC was normal and patient remained afebrile.
.
The patient's mental status began to return to her baseline. She
demonstrated a significant level of underlying dementia, but
also brief episodes of delirium. During these, the patient would
look around the room, respond to paranoid delusions, and refuse
treatment. It was thought that the patient's underlying
dementia, deficiency in sensory input (severe hearing loss),
resolving infection, and hospital environment all contributed to
delirium. TSH was wnl. RPR was negative. B12 was normal. Vitamin
D levels were pending at discharge, and the patient was treated
empirically with Vitamin D and thiamine supplements. She was
treated with standing Zyprexa zydis in morning and bedtime. The
patient's Lasix was D/Ced since she was felt to be dry,
complaining of thirst and increased BUN. Her Lasix could be
restarted as outpatient if necessary. Appears euvolemic on
discharge.
At discharge, patient was agreeing to treatment, calm,
cooperative, with no complaints. She benefitted from
amplification headphones and may benefit from hearing aids if
she agrees.
.
#. hypotension:
On the medicine floor, the patient had an episode of hypotension
with SBP 70's. The patient was given several IVF boluses, and
when hypotension did not resolve, MICU was called to place
central line and arrange transfer. Left IJ was placed and fluid
resusitation continued during transfer. The patient was started
on vanco/zosyn. When the patient arrived in the MICU,
hypotension had resolved without any further intervention. Blood
pressure remained stable for remainder of course. Vanco/Zosyn
were D/Ced, and patient returned to medicine floor. She remained
hemodynamically stable and afebrile for remainder of course.
.
# Decubitus left heel ulcer
The patient was noted to have a left heel ulcer, unable to be
staged without debridement. Both vascular surgery and podiatry
were consulted. Both recommended holding off debridement or more
extensive treatment until patient's infection resolved and
placement situation stabilized. The patient is known to have
severe PVD, likely not a candidate for revascularization.
Dressing changes with collagenase ointment and multipodus boots
should be continued, feet should be elevated.
The patient should follow-up with podiatry and vascular surgery.

.
# DM
The patient's home oral anti-hyperglycemics were held. The
patient was controlled on HISS, and standing Lantus and Humalog
with meals was added for improved glycemic control.
.
# HTN
The patient's home antihypertensives were held with hypotensive
episode. Home dose of lisinopril and half home dose of
metoprolol was eventually restarted without issues. The patient
was on Lasix at home, but in setting of hypotensive episode,
this was held. A small dose (5 mg [**Hospital1 **]) was tried, but patient
seemed dry and BUN increased. We will hold off Lasix for now
since patient euvolemic.
.
# Chronic systolic CHF.
The patient had a TTE which showed worsening EF from 35-40% in
[**2151**] to 20-25%. The patient was continued on lisinopril and
metoprolol. Home Lasix was held. The patient did not demonstrate
signs of volume overload on physical exam. The patient was
restarted on ASA 81 mg. Ezetimibe was D/Ced since of little
benefit to patient at this stage.
.
# Hypothyroidism.
TSH normal. Continued home dose levothyroxine.
.
# Depression
Continued duloxetine
.
#. Psychosocial:
The patient had been cared for by her son, who suffers from
mental illness. It was unclear if she was reliably receiving her
medications or food. Social work and elder care were involved in
her course. Her [**Year (4 digits) 802**] [**Name (NI) 1154**] is her HCP. The patient's son
should not be responsible for care decisions.
.
The patient was discharged to rehab facility (Roscommons)
