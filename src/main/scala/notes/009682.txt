Images-

xray
RIGHT FEMUR: Diffuse osteopenia. Suboptimal radiograph for
evaluation of a
fracture. No definite fracture or dislocation seen; however
subtle fracture could be missed. On one of the images, there is
overlapping hand with ring, which is limiting the evaluation of
that area.

RIGHT KNEE: Status post total knee arthroplasty. No evidence of
lucency at
the total hip prosthesis. No evidence of fracture or
dislocation. Vascular
calcifications are seen. There is a large calcified fibroid.

IMPRESSION
1. Suboptimal radiograph; however, no definite fracture or
dislocation seen. 2. Vascular calcifications.
3. Calcified fibroid.

IMPRESSION:
No evidence of free fluid or hematoma.

PRELIMINARY READ-
non displaced fracture of the left lesser trochanter. No
hematoma.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient is an 81 year old female with past medical history
of coronary artery disease, aortic stenosis status post Aortic
valve repair, diastolic congestive heart failure, End stage
renal disease on hemodialysis (MWF [**Location (un) **]), diabetes , and
hypertension who presents with left hip pain.

In the ED, VS were : T98.4 BP 104/48 HR 58 RR18 100%RA. She
received tramadol and toradol for pain but was still unable to
ambulate given severe pain. The next morning in the ED her blood
pressure was found to be in the 84/31 -> 78/32. She also had a
Hct drop from 37 to 31 and there was concern that she was
bleeding.  She was given 2L NS while in the ED with some
improvement in pressure and her AM BP meds were held. Hip films
showed osteopenia but no fractures.  CT abdomen and CT thigh
were done to further evaluate her hypotension and the CT thigh
showed nondisplaced fracture of her left lesser trochanter.
Ortho was consulted and felt she did not need surgery and
recommended PT consult and partial weight bearing as tolerated.
She was transferred to the ICU for further management of her
hypotension.

# Hypotension: Her BP improved with 2L of fluid bolus. The
hypotension was thought to be realated to fluid depletion
initially. Her BP meds were stopped. She had several low BPs
into the 80s while asleep, and was given small fluid boluses
without great effect. She went for HD the day after admisison,
she was 7kg above her dry wt, had 1.5 liters removed and BP
actually improved. Therefore, she was likely not fluid depleted,
but more likely was fluid overloaded. Her hct was stable and a
CT of the extremity and abd/pelvis showed no evidence of
bleeding as an explaination. Her amiodarone was restarted but
her metoprolol and hydralazine were held.  When she was
transfered to the medicine floor, her BP meds continued to be
held and her blood pressure remained in the low 100s.  She
should continue to not take her metoprolol as long as her blood
pressures remains low, but this medication can be restarted as
an outpatient if her BP increases.

# Trochanteric fracture: She had a new stable, non-displaced
fracture. Pt was seen by ortho who recommended partial weight
bearing as tolerated and PT, and surgical repair was not needed
at this time. She was treated for her pain with tylenol and IV
morphine with her turning. She continued to improve and did well
on tylenol alone.

# ESRD: Continued on HD M/W/F. Continued on nephrocaps and
sevelamir. Renal followed the pt while admited. She should be
discharged on a new medication:  Sevelamer Carbonate 2400 mg
three times a day with meals.

# Anemia of chronic disease: Iron studdies showed ferretin 1295,
TIBC 161, trasnferin 124.  Pt received EPO at hemodialysis.

# Hypothyroidism: stable. Continued on levothyroxine.  TSH = 3.5

# Atrial fibrillation: She was in sinus rhythm and her
metoprolol was initially was held due to low BP. She was
continued on her amiodarone. She was continued on
anticoagulation.

# Hyperlipidemia: She was continued on her statin
