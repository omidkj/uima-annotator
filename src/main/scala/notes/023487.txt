CHIEF  COMPLAINT:   The patient was admitted for shortness of
breath, hypoxia, and hypotension.

HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 72-year-old
male  with  a  complicated  recent medical course including a
long  hospitalization  beginning  in  [**Month (only) 404**] for respiratory
failure,  CHF,  and  urosepsis.   He subsequently had current
episodes  of  gastrointestinal bleeding secondary to ischemic
colitis  in  [**Month (only) 956**] and [**Month (only) 958**].  He was transferred from the
nursing  home  on  [**5-19**], for evaluation of hypotension,
hypoxia,  and lethargy.  His family states that over the past
three  days,  he  had  been developing cough and shortness of
breath.    At dialysis, he was noted to have coarse crackles.
On  his respiratory examination, an oxygen requirement.  When
he  arrived  in  the  ER,  he  was  hypotensive with systolic
pressures  in  the  70s,  which  was  managed  initially with
dopamine.    In the ER also it was noted that he did not wish
to  be intubated because of his difficulty with extubation in
the   past.    Mask  ventilation  was  initiated  because  of
hypocarbic respiratory failure.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  End-stage renal disease on hemodialysis.
2.    Coronary  artery  disease status post large LAD infarct
[**2149-12-9**].  EF approximately 20%.
3.  Type 2 diabetes mellitus.
4.  Peripheral vascular disease.
5.  Obstructive sleep apnea.
6.  Pseudomonas UTI.
7.  Atrial fibrillation.
8.  Recent gastrointestinal bleeds.

ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.

ADMISSION MEDICATIONS:
1.  Captopril.
2.  Aspirin.
3.  Amiodarone.
4.  Lipitor.

one son who live in the area.

PHYSICAL  EXAMINATION:    Examination revealed the following:
VITAL   SIGNS:    Temperature  100.4,  blood  pressure  90/50
initially,  now  120/70  on dopamine.  Heart rate in the 80s;
100%  oxygen  saturation  on mask ventilation.  GENERAL:  The
patient  is somnolent, but arousable.  NECK:  No JVD.  LUNGS:
Coarse  breath  sounds  bilaterally.   HEART:  Distal regular
rhythm.    No  murmurs,  rubs,  or  gallops.  ABDOMEN:  Soft,
nontender,    nondistended,    normoactive    bowel   sounds.
EXTREMITIES:    1+  lower  extremity edema.  Right subclavian
dialysis  catheter site looks fine.  Bilateral heel decubitus
ulcers,  which  were  dry.  BACK:  He has a stage I decubitus
ulcer.  NEUROLOGICAL:  Examination was briskly nonfocal.

LABORATORY  DATA:    Initial  laboratory  values revealed the
following:  White blood cell 36,000, 87 neutrophils, 4 bands,
hematocrit  39, platelet count 521,000, sodium 137, potassium
4.7,  chloride  103,  bicarbonate 19, BUN 28, creatinine 2.9,
glucose  153.  Initial blood gas revealed the pH of 7.29, CO2
49, pO2 72.

Chest x-ray:  Edema versus chronic interstitial disease and a
right  lower  lobe  pneumonia.   No effusions.  Blood culture
grew group B Strep.

HOSPITAL   COURSE:      The   patient   received   aggressive
antibiotics, as well as blood pressure supporting medications
in the emergency room.  After the patient was admitted to the
MICU a family meeting was held and it was determined that the
patient  would  not be happy returning to the quality of life
from  which  he  came  which was unable to walk and unable to
feed  himself living in a nursing home.  It was unlikely that
he  would be able to regain a high level of functioning if he
had aggressive therapy.  He was made comfort oriented shortly
after  admission.    At  that  time  he  was  maintained on a
morphine  drip with close attention being pain to his symptom
relief.    His  family  remained  at  the bedside and he died
comfortably  on  the morning of [**2150-5-21**].  Autopsy was
offered and discussed, but declined.









DIAGNOSES:
1.  Respiratory failure most likely secondary to pneumonia in
the    setting   of   end-stage   renal   disease   requiring
hemodialysis.
2.  Coronary artery disease status post MI.
