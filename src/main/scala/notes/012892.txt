History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 23505**] is a 82 yoM w/ metastatic prostate cancer who
presented with confusion and generalized weakness. He was
diagnosed with prostate cancer 9 years ago, at which time he
received XRT. 6 years ago, given recurrence, he was started on
Lupron; Casodex was started last year. He was followed by Dr.
[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1968**] at [**Hospital1 2025**], and was recently started on a new protocol
using an amidogen product for bone metastases. Given severe
progressive weakness in both lower extremities and lumbar back
pain, he had a lumbar MRI [**2104-5-15**] (ordered by his neurologist Dr.
[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name (STitle) 23506**]), which showed a tight stenosis at L4/5 and
metastatic lesions at multiple levels, predominalty L5 and S1
with epidural metastases. He was admitted [**Date range (1) 23507**] to [**Hospital1 23508**]. There, he was started on steroids. EMG
revealed generalized neuropathy and acute severe L5-S1
radiculopathy bilaterally, consistent with known
stenosis/epidural metastases. MRI of cervical and thoracic spine
revealed multi-level sclerotic lesions suggesting metastic
disease. A bone scane demonstrated muld lumbosacral uptake,
along with uptake on left lower rib cage, left femur, and right
humerus. He was evaluated by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 23509**] of oncology, who
discontinued Casodex (given elevated LFTs) and referred him to
radiation oncology for radiation treatments - received [**2104-5-22**]
and [**2104-5-23**]. Pt was discharged on [**2104-5-22**] to complete 10
radiation treatments as an outpatient; he also apparently
transferred his oncologic care to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 23509**] and was planning
to follow-up with him as an outpatient.
.
On [**5-24**], his wife noted that the patient was more confused than
usual - having to be reminded about the date or appointments. He
also noted generalized weakness, although he cannot localize
this to specific extremities. This prompted him to present to
[**Hospital1 18**] ED, on [**5-26**] where he was noted to be febrile to 101. He
was admitted and on [**5-27**] an MRI of the L spine was obtained
showing metastasis. Steroids were increased to 4 mg
dexamethasone Q6 and XRT was continued. As he was febrile, a
course of levaquin was started for presumed CAP and UTI as he
had a positive UA.  He was noted to be in renal failure on [**5-27**]
and developed an O2 requirement for which he was diuresed
without improvement. He grew staph from his blood and
antibiotics were switched to vanco and pip tazo.
.
On day of transfer to ICU, the patient was noted to be in a.fib
with rates in the 130's and hypotensive to 95/63. He continued
to be confused. He was noted to have an Aa gradient on his ABG.
He was transferred to ICU for further evaluation and management
of his hypotension.
.
ROS: Currently, patient denies any pain, but admits to shortness
of breath. He denies dysuria. Per report he has had cough,
productive of minimal sputum. No weight loss, night sweats, loss
of vision, sinus pain, sore throat, chest pain, palpitations,
shortness of breath, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, abdominal
swelling, melena, bleeding, dysuria, rash, headache.

[**5-26**] renal u/s: Suggestion of mild left-sided collecting system
fullness, which is incompletely evaluated given suboptimal
patient positioning.  Mild left sided hydronephrosis cannot be
excluded.
.
[**2104-5-26**] CXR: There is some soft tissue density on both sides of
the trachea in the superior mediastinum, with mild tracheal
deviation to the right. The lungs are clear without
consolidation. No pleural effusion is seen. There are
degenerative changes of the spine, but no sclerotic foci are
identified.
.
[**2104-5-26**] Head CT w/o contrast: No acute intracranial hemorrhage
or mass effect.
.
[**5-26**] MRI L spine: Large enhancing mass involving L5 and S1
vertebrae, with prominent compression of the thecal sac and,
less extensively, encroachment into the L5/S1 neural foramina,
compatible with metastatic disease. Additinal foci in the
vertebral body of L4 and left ilium are also concerning for
metastatic disease.
