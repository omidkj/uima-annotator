Service:  [**Hospital Unit Name 196**]

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 79 year-old male who
is status post pacemaker placement in [**2171**] for complete heart
block who presents this admission for pacer and lead
extraction due to infection.  He had been doing well with the
pacer until [**2180-9-10**] when he underwent degenerative
change at [**Hospital3 **].  The following [**2181-5-10**] he
began noticing infection in his pocket site.  In [**2181-8-10**]
he underwent revision of his pacemaker pocket.  Unfortunately
infection recurred and underwent a second pacemaker pocket
revision on [**10-13**].  Since then he has developed
staph epidermitis bacteremia without systemic symptoms.  He
has been treated with intravenous Vancomycin for six weeks.
He presents for a pacemaker lead extraction.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Congestive heart failure EF of 35% status post mitral
valve repair with mechanical valve in [**2174**], status post
pacemaker pocket revision times two.
2.  Status post left brachial PICC placement.
3.  Appendectomy.
4.  Hypertension.
5.  Hypercholesterolemia.
6.  Status post bilateral knee replacement.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives with his wife.  [**Name (NI) **] tobacco
history.  No alcohol history.

ALLERGIES:  Horse serum.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1.  Coumadin 5 mg Saturday, Sunday, Tuesday, Thursday.  Last
dose [**2182-1-27**].
2.  Toprol XL 25 mg po q.d.
3.  Lisinopril 5 mg po q.d.
4.  Digoxin .125 mg po q.d.
5.  Lipitor 10 mg q.d.
6.  Vancomycin 1 to 2 grams q 30 hours.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  In general he is a
pleasant elderly male in no acute distress.  His vital signs
were stable.  His lungs were clear to auscultation
bilaterally.  His heart was regular rate and rhythm with
mechanical S2.

LABORATORY:  His hematocrit was 38.2, creatinine 1.0,
otherwise his laboratory values were normal.  His chest x-ray
showed no acute infiltration or effusion on admission.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  1.  Cardiovascular:  This 79 year-old man
with infected pacemaker pocket was admitted for pacemaker
explantation at its leads.  He was initially started on
heparin while his Coumadin was held in order to have the
pacemaker lead extraction.  Mr. [**Known lastname **] remained off his Coumadin
until [**2-1**] when the patient underwent new pacemaker
implantation into a new abdominal pocket.  On [**2182-2-2**] the
patient then underwent a lead extraction.  Post lead
extraction the patient was continued on his heparin while he
was restarted on his Coumadin to get a therapeutic INR given
that he has a mitral valve replacement.  The patient was
briefly on the CT surgical service after the pacemaker lead
extraction.  He was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 196**] Service on
[**2182-2-2**].  At this time his vital signs were stable.  He had
two JP drains on in the right upper chest draining scant
blood and one in the left upper abdomen with serosanguinous
drainage as well.  His dressings were clean, dry and intact.
At this time his hematocrit was 36.4, creatinine 0.9, INR
1.8.  His Coumadin was restarted per EPREX.  In addition the
Infectious Disease Service was consulted for recommendations
recommendations regarding the duration of his Vancomycin for
the staph epidermitis bacteremia now that his pacemaker leads
were extracted and the old pacemaker was removed from the
pacemaker pocket.

The Infectious Disease Service recommended that the patient
have a TEE, however, a TEE had been attempted during the
pacemaker lead extraction in the Operating Room.  The
anesthesiologist had refused to do a TEE here given the
patient has a history of Zenker's diverticulum.  Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] the attending felt that the patient could be
managed without having a TEE.  In particular Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
felt that the patient did not require any further intravenous
Vancomycin given that the patient had six weeks of
intravenous Vancomycin and discussed this with his primary
care physician [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) 17863**].  The patient was to have his
Vancomycin throughout the hospital stay here and then be
discharged without Vancomycin.  He was to have follow up
surveillance blood cultures one week after discharge off of
Vancomycin to ensure that he did not develop any further
bacteremia.

In terms of his pacemaker pocket on the right upper shoulder
the patient did develop a subcutaneous hematoma and possible
fluid collection.  The patient was taken back to the
Operating Room on [**2-6**] for pacemaker pocket evacuation.  A
new JP drain was placed with good drainage.  The patient's
heparin had been held for 12 hours with the development of
the subcutaneous fluid collection/hematoma per PE
recommendations.  The heparin was restarted cautiously after
the evacuation of the pacemaker pocket.  Unfortunately the
patient did develop a recurrent small hematoma, however, this
remained stable and the drainage from the JP drain tapered
off, therefore the JP drain was removed by the CT Surgery
Service.  After days of remaining subtherapeutic and INR was
therapeutic at 2.7 on [**2182-2-10**] his Coumadin was dosed was
decreased for a goal INR of 2 to 2.5 for the next week given
the bleeding recurrence at the pacemaker pocket.  The patient
was discharged with close follow up with his primary care
physician [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) 17863**].

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Stable.  The patient's hematoma had
remained stable overnight with no further bleeding.  He was
ambulating and pain free.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Status post pacemaker lead extraction.
2.  New pacemaker implantation.
3.  Atrial fibrillation.
4.  Mitral valve replacement.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Ranitidine 150 mg po b.i.d.
2.  Digoxin 125 micrograms po q day.
3.  Aspirin 81 mg po q.d.
4.  Lisinopril 5 mg po q.d.
5.  Tylenol 650 mg po q 4 hours prn pain.
6.  Warfarin 5 mg po q.d.

FOLLOW UP:  The patient is to follow up with his primary care
physician [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) 17863**] on Tuesday [**2-12**] after discharge.  In
addition, he was instructed that he will need to have his INR
checked at Dr.[**Name (NI) 41457**] office three days after discharge to
further adjust his Coumadin dosing and to ensure that he [**Known lastname **]s
not become too supratherapeutic.  In addition, he was to
follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 17863**] in one week after discharge on
Monday [**2-18**] for bacterial cultures to ensure that there is no
sign of infection off the Vancomycin.  He was also to call
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for appointments to follow up
within the week.  He was also instructed that he should call
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 11493**] to follow up after discharge.  He was advised that
if he had any fevers or chills or increased pain at his
pacemaker site that he should call Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 17863**] his primary care
physician immediately for further medical advice.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  To home with services.  The patient is
discharged to home with a home safety evaluation by the VNA
given that he was elderly to ensure that he did not need any
other medical services in the home.
