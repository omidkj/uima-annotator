Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1654**]
Chief Complaint:
Respiratory Failure


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
intubation
laryngoscopy
flexible bronchoscopy


History of Present Illness:
This is a 79 yo M with a past medical history of , who was
brought to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED after being noted to be dyspneic at
[**Hospital 100**] Rehab. In the ED, despite having inspiratory and
expiratory stridor and using accessory muscles with increased
work of breathing, the patient denied shortness of breath. In
evaluation of his airway, there was some concern that he may
have epiglottitis. ENT was consulted and although they noted an
omega-epiglottis, there was no sign of infection. They
recommended 12mg decadron IV Q8h x 3 and bronchoscopy.
.
He was kept in the ED for several hours, and he began to look
tired, with some agitation and the decision was made to intubate
him. He was a difficult intubation, and thick secretions were
noted in his throat, raising the suspicion that he is unable to
clear his airway and that perhaps he had a mucous plug
contributing to his increased work of breathing.
.
Of note, he has had a dry cough for about 3 weeks pta. He had a
CXR which was notable for a lack of an acute intrathoracic
process. He was afebrile and hemodynamically stable while in the
ED.

EKG:  poor baseline. NSR@ 83. No acute ST-T wave changes.

INITIAL CXR [**12-19**]: FINDINGS:AP  upright  portable  chest
radiograph  is  obtained. Evaluation somewhat  limited  by  low
lung  volumes.    The  lungs  are  clear  bilaterally,
demonstrating  no  evidence  of  pneumonia  or  CHF. The
cardiomediastinal silhouette  is  unremarkable. There  is  no
pneumothorax. No  evidence  of  foreign body. Bowel  gas
pattern  appears  unremarkable. Visualized  osseous  structures
are  intact. Degenerative changes  are  noted  in  the  spine.
IMPRESSION: No  acute  intrathoracic  process.
.
MRI [**12-19**] Neck Soft Tissues: FINDINGS:  When compared with prior
MRI dated [**2187-12-5**], there is prominence of the epiglottis.
Multilevel degenerative changes are again noted in the cervical
spine with prominent anterior osteophytes at multiple levels.
IMPRESSION: 1. Prominence of the epiglottis. Clinical
correlation
is advised.  2. Degenerative changes in the cervical spine, not
significantly changed from prior study.

Brief Hospital Course:
.
# Respiratory Failure - Chest xray did not show pneumonia, but
viral infection was suspected in the setting of cough and thick
airway secretions. If exacerbated by dehydration, these could
become thick enough to cause difficulty clearing past an
enlarged omega-shaped epiglottis which was identified on
laryngoscopy.  The increased work of breathing could have been
caused either by a mucous plug caught at the epiglottis, or a
bronchial plug resulting in transient lobar collapse.  He
underwent bronchoscopy by Interventional Pulmonary which showed
thick secretions but no airway lesions.  It does not seem that
this is a lower airway issue as he did very well on minimal
pressure support and was extubated shortly.  He received 3 doses
of Decadron.  He was maintained on chest PT.  HOB was elevated
at all times and he was maintained on aspiration precautions.
He underwent swallow evaluation which showed aspiration with
thin liquids and difficulty with regular solids.  He should also
have strict supervision with eating and reevaluation of
swallowing function if shows any sign of aspiration.  The
possibility of bulbar dysfunction was considered given his
neurologic deterioration over the last couple of months.  As his
respiratory function rapidly returned to [**Location 213**], neurologic
evaluation was deferred to the outpatient setting.  On
discharge, he was requiring daily Physical Therapy and
occasional oral suctioning to assist him in clearing his
secretions.  He oxygen saturation was 97 to 100% on room air.
.
# Dementia/Vertigo - Concern over last few months that this
patient may have [**Last Name (un) 309**] body dementia as he has had progressive
decline with hallucinations with a history of a gait disorder.
Neurologic evaluation deferred as above.  He had occasional
agitation with redirectability at night which did not require
medication.
.
# DM2 - His Actos and glipizide were initially held in the
setting of being NPO.  They were restarted when he began taking
regular po.  He was maintained on [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Doctor First Name **] diet and his
fingersticks were under reasonable control.
.
# Hypernatremia - He developed hypernatremia on the floor, which
was thought secondary to hypovolemia from poor po intake after
extubation.  He was given gentle fluid resuscitation after which
his sodium normalized.  He should be encouraged to take po
(nectar thickened) fluids and have his sodium level rechecked on
[**2188-12-24**].

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted with respiratory distress.  You were
temporarily intubated and placed on ventilator.  You were
evaluated by ENT who found some edema in your larynx, but no
signs of infection.  You underwent bronchoscopy and were found
to have lots of respiratory secretions that were likely from a
viral syndrome.  Your chest xray showed no pneumonia.  After
extubation, you had excellent respiratory status with no oxygen
requirement.  You were evaluated by the Speech therapists who
have modified your diet to prevent aspiration.
.
Please take all of your medications as prescribed.  Please
attend all of your follow up appointments.
.
If you experience difficulty breathing, chest pain, fever, or
other concerning symptoms, please call your doctor or go to the
ER.

Followup Instructions:
Please call your primary care doctor, Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]
([**Telephone/Fax (1) 24024**], to schedule a follow up appointment within the
next 1-2 weeks.  Please discuss Neurology evaluation with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **].
