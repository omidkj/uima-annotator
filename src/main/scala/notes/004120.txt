Service: CARDIOTHORACIC

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1283**]
Chief Complaint:
Presyncope

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2142-10-2**] Aortic Valve Replacement(27mm [**Company 1543**] Mosaic Porcine
Valve). Replacement of Ascending Aorta and Hemiarch(30mm
Gelweave Graft) with Reimplantation of Innominate Artery


History of Present Illness:
This is an 82 year old male with known aortic stenosis and
increasing episodes of presyncope. Recent echocardiogram showed
severe aortic stenosis with [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Location (un) 109**] of 0.8cm2, peak 87 and mean
53 mmHg. There was trace aortic insufficinecy and 2+ mitral
regurgitation. His LVEF was estimated at 70%. Subsequent cardiac
catheterization showed heavily calcified aorta and dilated
ascending aorta, measuring 5.1 centimeters. Angiography revealed
a left dominant system and an 80% lesion in the right coronary
artery. Based upon the above, he was admitted for cardiac
surgical intervention.

[**2142-10-1**] Carotid Ultrasound: No evidence of hemodynamically
significant stenosis in the carotid arteries bilaterally.
[**2142-9-30**] Chest x-ray: Cardiomegaly. Increased linear markings
involving both lung bases. Findings represent atelectasis versus
scarring. Pneumonia is not entirely excluded. COPD. No effusion
detected.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 68565**] was admitted for heparinization and preoperative
evaluation. Workup was unremarkable, and carotid ultrasound
showed only minimal disease of the internal carotid arteries. He
was subsequently cleared for surgery. On [**10-2**], Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1290**]
performed an aortic valve replacement and replacement of his
ascending aorta and hemiarch with reimplantation of his
innominate artery. For additional surgical details, please see
seperate dictated operative note. Following the operation, he
was brought to the CSRU for invasive monitoring. He initially
required atrial pacing for junctional bradycardia. Within 24
hours, he awoke neurologically intact and was extubated on
postoperative day one. Initially hypoxic, he required aggressive
diuresis. Antihypertensives were titrated to maintain systolic
blood pressures less than 120mmHg. Over several days, his heart
rate improved as did his hypoxia. Pacing wires were removed on
postoperative day three and he transferred to the SDU for
further care and recovery. He remained in a rate controlled
atrial fibrillation. Warfarin was resumed and dosed for a goal
INR between 2.0 - 2.5. Warfarin was intermittently held for a
subtherapeutic prothrombin time. He experienced urinary
retention which required reinsertion of a foley catheter. Before
discharge, foley catheter was removed and he was voiding without
difficulty. He remained fluid overloaded with oxygen
requirements. He continued to require aggressive diuresis and
responded well to intravenous Lasix. He concomitantly had a
productive cough. Serial chest x-rays were significant for
improving bilateral pleural effusions with persistent lower lobe
atelectasis. He was empirically started on antibiotics. Sputum
cultures were obtained due to thick, green secretions.
Microbiology showed gram negative rods and gram positive cocci,
for which he was treated with levaquin. Over several days, he
made significant clinical improvements with diuresis. Postop, he
was also noted to have left upper extremity edema. Ultrasound
was obtained which showed no evidence of left upper extremity
deep venous thrombosis. Given his prior history of stroked with
persistent left sided weakness, he worked with physical and
occupational therapies to improve strength and mobility. Medical
therapy was optimized and he was eventually cleared for
discharge to rehab on postoperative day 13.
