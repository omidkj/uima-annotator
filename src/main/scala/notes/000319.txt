Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 358**]
Chief Complaint:
shortness of breath, productive cough

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
PICC line placement


History of Present Illness:
The patient is an 80-year-old female with a past medical history
significant for chronic bronchiectesis, MV-repair/tricuspid
valve replacement, CHF, and atrial fibrillation who presented to
to her primary care physician's office at [**Company 191**] just prior to this
hospital admission complaining of worsening dyspnea and cough.
At baseline, the patient has moderate amount of yellow sputum
and is on 2.5 L oxygen via home NC with typical oxygen
saturations ranging from 95-96%. Prior to presentation she
describes having 3-4 days of extreme fatigue, nausea, weakness
and worsening sputum production that was darker yellow-greenish
in color along with a more frequent cough. She was sent from the
[**Hospital 191**] clinic visit  over to the ED for further workup. In clinic
she had a temperature of 100.3 F, RR 33 and she had notable
accessory muscle use and obvious labored breathing.
.
In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED her vitals were: Temperature of 101.6F, HR 80,
SBP 130s, and oxygen saturations were in the low 90's on 4L NC
and remained in low 90s with higher rates on non-rebreather
mask. Despite her presentation, she had no significant WBC
elevations. On exam, she had rales throughout both lung fields.
On EKG she was V-paced as she has a pacemaker. She also had
evidence of atrial fibrillation on EKG. CXR in ED showed both
RUL and LLL opacities. She was given nebulizer treatments with
little effect. IV Vancomycin and Levofloxacin were also
initiated in the emergency room soon after her arrival. She was
felt to be too unstable for the general medical floor and was
admitted to the MICU service.
.
Following admission to MICU the patient continued to have
increased work of breathing and productive cough with low oxygen
saturations and was felt to be in hypoxic respiratory distress
with some hypercarbia as well as ABG showed a pO2 of 63mmHg and
pCO2 of 49. Fortunately, she did not require intubation but she
was started on non-invasive ventilation. She was mostly
normotensive with a few drops of SBP into the high 80s but she
did not require any pressors. IVFs were used sparingly given her
CHF history. She has a history of resistant pseudomonas so there
was some concern for re-infection, especially since gram
negative rods were found on sputum culture. Urine legionella
testing was sent off as well and she was continued on her
Levofloxacin coverage at time of her transfer to the general
medical floor until urine legionella results returned.
Vancomycin was discontinued at time of transfer out of MICU.
While in the MICU she also underwent daily chest PT and received
ongoing nebulizer treatments.
Upon arrival to the general medical floor she had been
successfully weaned down to 4-5L on nasal cannula with oxygen
saturation levels of 93%-95%. In general, she stated she was
feeling "much better" with more energy and less shortness of
breath at time of her transfer. Despite her CHF history she did
not seem to have any signs of fluid overload as her JVD was
5-6cm and she had no crackles on lung exam and no pedal edema.
She was continued on her usual Coumadin therapy for her atrial
fibrillation and tricuspid valve replacement but she had to hold
her Coumadin for a few evenings due to a high INR. Because of
her bronchiectasis her INR goal is uniquely 2.0 so the team made
note of this fact during her stay.

OTHER TESTS/IMAGING:
.
[**2137-10-14**] EKG :  Rate 80 and ventricular paced with slow atrial
fibrillation noted, no ST changes. Compared with EKG [**2137-6-9**]
.
[**2137-10-14**] CXR: Chronic interstitial lung disease with increased
right upper lobe and LLL opacities which may represent atypical
pneumonia or atelectasis.
.
[**2137-10-16**] CXR: The lungs are again well expanded. Evidence of
bronchiectasis is better seen on CT. Wedge-shaped opacity behind
the left heart appears slightly more consolidative; while this
could represent atelectasis related to impacted airways, if the
patient had fever, this could also represent consolidation.
Ill-defined opacity in the right upper lung is worse. Opacity
seen on CT in the left lung apex is not evident
radiographically. No new area of consolidation is noted.
No evidence of pneumothorax or pleural effusion is seen.
Cardiomediastinal
contours are unchanged. A left-sided transvenous pacemaker with
right atrial and right ventricular leads remain in place.
Sternotomy wires remain in place, tricuspid valve prosthesis and
possible mitral annular prosthesis remain in place.
