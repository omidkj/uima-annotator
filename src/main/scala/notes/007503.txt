Brief Hospital Course:
Pt was admitted to MICU for further evaluation and treatment of
hypotension. Pt had a history of hypotension in the past in the
setting of ESRD, however, he had never been symptomatic. In the
setting of peristent hypotension, pt was initially started on
Levophed and Dopamine. Chest radiographs indicated CHF. In
addition to CHF, patient had significant amount of abdominal
ascites which appeared to be increasig in size. CVVH was started
for additional fluid removal from CHF. Pt was able to maintain
pressures, and pressors were discontinued early in the course.
Pt responded well to CVVH-->HD. Pt, however, continued to have
low grade fevers from a gram positive bacteremia, and increasing
INR most likely secondary to antibiotic use in setting of
sepsis, despite being taken off anticoagulants.

Throughout the course, pt had fluctuating blood pressures, going
down to SBP 50's during HD. Although pt continued to mentate
well initially, pressors were again started with gentle fluid
boluses to maintain pressures. At this point, a new set of blood
cultures came back positive for GNR etiology unknown, possibly
from infected fluid from abdominal ascites. The focus of care
was now on managing pressures in the setting of septic
physiology. Pressors were continued with gentle hydration.

It was thought at this time by the family, with the patient
persistently pressor dependent with now, altered mental status,
that the patient be made CMO. Pt expired on [**2201-2-19**] in the early
morning.
