Service:  [**Hospital1 **]

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Patient is an 88-year-old female
with a history of severe chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease and chronic syndrome of inappropriate diuretic
hormone who was recently admitted for a chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease exacerbation to [**Hospital6 649**].  She was discharged to [**Hospital3 537**] on
[**2103-3-24**].  She was noted to have a variable level of
responsiveness with intermittent hypoxia with oxygen
saturations in the 60s.  She is known to become somnolent and
retain carbon dioxide if her oxygen saturations are too high.
She was brought to the Emergency Department for an
evaluation.  She denied any chest pain, shortness of breath,
cough, fevers, or chills.  An arterial blood gas revealed an
elevated carbon dioxide level of 78, higher than her baseline
in the 60s.

1.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
2.  Chronic syndrome of inappropriate diuretic hormone.
3.  Seizures.
4.  Mild dementia.
5.  Hypertension.
6.  Colon cancer, status post resection.
7.  Osteoarthritis.
8.  Lacunar infarcts.
9.  Iron deficiency anemia.
10. Hard of hearing.

ALLERGIES:  Doxycycline.

MEDICATIONS:
1.  Sodium chloride 1 gram po t.i.d.
2.  Solu-Medrol inhaler 20 mcg 2 puffs po b.i.d.
3.  Calcium carbonate 1.25 grams po t.i.d.
4.  Vitamin D 400 units po q.d.
5.  Protonix 40 mg po q.d.
6.  Fosamax 70 mg po q. Friday.
7.  Aspirin 81 mg po q.d.
8.  Colace 100 mg po b.i.d.
9.  Iron sulfate 225 mg po q.d.
10. Atrovent nebulizers, 1 nebulizer po q. 6 hours prn.
11. Combivent inhaler 2 puffs po q. 4 hours.
12. Ritalin 5 mg po b.i.d.
13. Prednisone taper, currently 40 mg po q.d.
14. Dilantin taper, currently 100 mg po b.i.d.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives at home with her family,
but was recently a resident of the [**Hospital3 537**].

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient was afebrile with a
temperature of 97.  Heart rate 86.  Blood pressure 150/80.
Respiratory rate 20.  Oxygen saturation 89% on room air,
improving to 95% on two liters by nasal cannula.  In general,
the patient was somnolent, but arousable.  Head and neck exam
are significant for moist mucous membranes, supple neck, and
no lymphadenopathy.  Lungs had crackles at the left base with
very poor air movement bilaterally.  Cardiac exam revealed a
regular rate and rhythm with no murmurs.  Abdomen was benign.
Extremities had no edema.

LABORATORIES STUDIES:  Significant for a hematocrit of 36.7
and a platelet count of 516,000.  Panel 7 is significant for
a sodium of 122, chloride 80, and bicarbonate of 32.  The
patient's baseline sodium is known to be 125-132.  Arterial
blood gas revealed a pH of 7.35, pCO2 of 75, pO2 of 78, and
bicarbonate of 43.  Chest x-ray revealed hyperinflated lung
fields with no infiltrates or effusions.  Electrocardiogram
showed normal sinus rhythm at 85 beats per minute with normal
axis and intervals and no ST-T wave changes compared to old
electrocardiograms.

HOSPITAL COURSE:

1.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease:  It is not
believed that the patient had an exacerbation of her chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease, but instead was somnolent from
elevated oxygen saturations.  She was continued on her
current admission dose of steroids, continue with inhalers,
and started on antibiotics.  She received BiPAP at night with
settings of 12 and 5, had an improvement in her arterial
blood gas showing a pH of 7.42, pCO2 of 59 and pO2 of 134.
She was quickly weaned down to 2 liters of oxygen by nasal
cannula, which the patient receives at home.  At the time of
discharge, the patient had no shortness of breath or
productive cough, and maintained good oxygen saturations on
one liter of oxygen by nasal cannula.  She will continue on
her steroid taper, as well as on her inhalers, but does not
require further antibiotic treatment. Of greatest benefit to
her, would be the continued use of her BiPAP machine at
night.

2.  Syndrome of inappropriate diuretic hormone:  The patient
was fluid restricted to one liter of free water per day, and
her sodium chloride tablets were continued.  At the time of
discharge, her sodium had returned to her normal baseline
level of 127.

3.  Neurology:  The patient is continued on her Dilantin
taper.  She did not have any seizures during her
hospitalization.  It was felt that her prior seizures were
secondary to toxic metabolic events, which do not require
antiepileptic medications.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  The patient was discharged in stable
condition to the [**Hospital3 537**].

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
2.  Chronic syndrome of inappropriate diuretic hormone.
3.  Seizures.
4.  Mild dementia.
5.  Hypertension.
6.  Colon cancer, status post resection.
7.  Osteoarthritis.
8.  Lacunar infarcts.
9.  Iron deficiency anemia.
10. Hard of hearing.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Sodium chloride 1 gram po t.i.d.
2.  Solu-Medrol inhaler 20 mcg 2 puffs po b.i.d.
3.  Calcium carbonate 1.25 grams po t.i.d.
4.  Vitamin D 400 units po q.d.
5.  Protonix 40 mg po q.d.
6.  Fosamax 70 mg po q. Friday.
7.  Aspirin 81 mg po q.d.
8.  Colace 100 mg po b.i.d.
9.  Iron sulfate 225 mg po q.d.
10. Atrovent nebulizers, 1 nebulizer po q. 6 hours prn.
11. Combivent inhaler 2 puffs po q. 4 hours.
12. Ritalin 5 mg po b.i.d.
13. Prednisone taper, 40 mg po q.d. times two days, 30 mg po
times three days, 20 mg po q.d. times three days, 10 mg po
q.d. times three days, then off.
14. Dilantin 100 mg po b.i.d. times two days, then 100 mg po
q.d. times seven days, then off.

DISCHARGE FOLLOW-UP PLANS:
1.  The patient should follow-up with her primary care
physician in one to two weeks.
2.  The patient should follow-up with a pulmonologist as
needed for the treatment of her chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease.
3.  The patient was encouraged and should continue to use her
BiPAP at night with settings of 8 and 5.
